1193581,AA231NH7SQZ4P,B001G7PSZI,Blitzkrieg,"[0, 0]","I've had the two X-Files films on DVD for sometime, so I know how they look in comparison with the Blu-ray releases. Fight the Future on Blu-ray certainly looks better than the anamorphic DVD, although you wouldn't know it throughout the beginning of the film until after the building explosion. The colors are way off sometimes. It gets better though and it winds up being worth the upgrade if you are a fan of the film. However, Fox did little work on the transfer to make it look it's best. All you have to do is take a look at the Gag Reel and see what the true potential of the film could have been. Some of the shots in the Gag Reel are so crystal clear, so phenomenal, that it makes Fox look really bad and really cheap for releasing this as is. The sound quality is encoded at a much higher bit rate than the DVD, so the sound is much more dynamic and immersive.I Want to Believe on Blu-ray isn't a huge leap over the DVD, but it still benefits. The film still has a processed look due to the strong blue-green color palette used. I was hoping that would be lessened on Blu-ray, since the higher encode allows for a greater number of colors to show through, but it's the same. The blacks are better, the shades of light are better rendered, and there is more detail in the image. The sound quality is more dynamic than the DVD, though not by much, but that has more to do with the design than the transfer.The special features on I Want to Believe are far more detailed than on Fight the Future, but I'm not big on special features anyway, except for well produced making of documentaries.

I have not seen the 1st film on BD, but I have seen it on SD, and I liked it more than the second film. The quality of ""I Want to Believe"" is a 4/5. It was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma, and BD35K player.While the 1st film integrates into the plot, the second does little if nothing, in my opinion to push the story forward. It was fantastic to see Mulder and Skully's chemistry again on screen, but the plot was convoluted, and I was disappointed that the entire story had nothing to to do with the larger conspiracy. I deliberately stayed away from movie theater reviews, as I knew it would be difficult for a second film to stand up to the X-Files fan legacy.I just recently watched this second film, having promised 2 friends, we'd wait to see it with them. I loved some of the inside humor between the two characters, but the story was somewhat ludicrous. I still cling on to hope that there will be another film in December 2012 (according to Cancer Man, this was the year/month that the war between humans and aliens would take place, I believe). Although this is all a rumor, and more wishful thinking at this point, I hope that the series is given a proper closure with a third film.As far as I am concerned, make a NEW X-Files series!:) It's worth a rent, if a you're a fan, but don't expect to get any answers or closure to the series.",4,"Great treat for fans, last film adds little to overall story",1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,1434,"['huge', 'fan', 'watcher', 'entire', 'series', 'double', 'pack', 'was', 'must', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '1st', 'film', 'BD', 'have', 'seen', 'SD', 'liked', 'more', 'second', 'film', 'quality', 'Want', 'Believe', '4/5', 'was', 'watched', '42', 'Panasonic', 'Plasma', 'BD35K', 'player.While', '1st', 'film', 'integrates', 'plot', 'second', 'little', 'nothing', 'opinion', 'push', 'story', 'forward', 'was', 'fantastic', 'see', 'Mulder', 'Skully', 'chemistry', 'again', 'screen', 'plot', 'was', 'convoluted', 'was', 'disappointed', 'entire', 'story', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'larger', 'conspiracy', 'deliberately', 'stayed', 'away', 'movie', 'theater', 'reviews', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'second', 'film', 'stand', 'up', 'X-Files', 'fan', 'legacy.I', 'just', 'recently', 'watched', 'second', 'film', 'having', 'promised', '2', 'friends', ""'d"", 'wait', 'see', 'loved', 'inside', 'humor', 'two', 'characters', 'story', 'was', 'somewhat', 'ludicrous', 'still', 'cling', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'December', '2012', 'according', 'Cancer', 'Man', 'was', 'year/month', 'war', 'humans', 'aliens', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'believe', 'rumor', 'more', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'point', 'hope', 'series', 'given', 'proper', 'closure', 'third', 'film.As', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'make', 'NEW', 'X-Files', 'series', 'rent', ""'re"", 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'get', 'answers', 'closure', 'series']",The X-Files Movie: 2-Pack (Fight the Future / I Want to Believe)

1193585,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B001G7PSZI,D. S. Thurlow,"[5, 5]","""The X-Files Movie 2-Pack"" contains both cinematic releases based on the X-Files TV series, the science fiction fan favorite which ran on network television from 1993 to 2002.The two movies, perhaps appropriately, exemplify the twin themes of the TV series.  1998's ""Fight the Future"", released between the fifth and sixth tv seasons, is a big screen statement of the complicated conspiracy at the heart of the show.  FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully follow a trail of clues that leads from a prehistoric virus to the destruction of a federal office building in Oklahoma City to a global chase after the elusive members of a syndicate dedicated to concealing a staggering secret.  Along the way, Mulder and Scully work through a crisis in their complicated relationship, while Mulder receives what may have been the clearest explanation ever provided of the grand conspiracy involving aliens and humans.2008's ""I Want To Believe"" was released several years after the end of the tv show.  Its plot is a classic ""monster of the week"" episode, in which an FBI agent is brutally kidnapped.  Mulder emerges from hiding and Scully from uneasy retirement to stop a hideous medical experiment.  The movie nicely updates the personal story of Mulder and Scully since the untidy ending of the tv series.The X-Files movies have a mixed reputation among hardcore fans; it may be that the TV show just didn't translate all that well to the big screen.  However, ""The X-Files Movie 2-Pack"" is highly recommended to X-Files fans, and to newcomers wondering what they might have missed in a great science fiction series.",5,The X-Files Revisited...,1282694400,"08 25, 2010",2010,1609,"['X-Files', 'Movie', '2-Pack', 'cinematic', 'releases', 'based', 'X-Files', 'TV', 'series', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan', 'favorite', 'ran', 'network', 'television', '1993', '2002.The', 'two', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'appropriately', 'exemplify', 'twin', 'themes', 'TV', 'series', '1998', 'Fight', 'Future', 'released', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'tv', 'seasons', 'big', 'screen', 'statement', 'complicated', 'conspiracy', 'heart', 'show', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'follow', 'trail', 'clues', 'prehistoric', 'virus', 'destruction', 'federal', 'office', 'building', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'global', 'chase', 'elusive', 'members', 'syndicate', 'dedicated', 'concealing', 'staggering', 'secret', 'way', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'work', 'crisis', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'Mulder', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'clearest', 'explanation', 'ever', 'provided', 'grand', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'aliens', 'humans.2008', 'Want', 'Believe', 'was', 'released', 'several', 'years', 'end', 'tv', 'show', 'plot', 'classic', 'monster', 'week', 'episode', 'FBI', 'agent', 'brutally', 'kidnapped', 'Mulder', 'emerges', 'hiding', 'Scully', 'uneasy', 'retirement', 'stop', 'hideous', 'medical', 'experiment', 'movie', 'nicely', 'personal', 'story', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'untidy', 'ending', 'tv', 'series.The', 'X-Files', 'movies', 'have', 'mixed', 'reputation', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'TV', 'show', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'However', 'X-Files', 'Movie', '2-Pack', 'highly', 'recommended', 'X-Files', 'fans', 'newcomers', 'wondering', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'series']",The X-Files Movie: 2-Pack (Fight the Future / I Want to Believe)

They were already DEAD when the bomb went off and clearly the bombing was designed to cover this up.""Fight the Future"" is a strong movie and a key ""episode"" of the mythology arc but can stand on its own as well.

It plays like a smaller, more intimate movie so don't come expecting ""Fight the Future"" and you won't be disappointed. The story is a bit muddled at times and is a bit slow paced but has its rewards.The film, regardless of how you feel about it, looks excellent with a crisp image that isn't digitally overprocessed. The extras are excellent with a PIP commentary from Carter and Spotnitz, a full length documentary on the making of the film. We also get a gag reel. It doesn't say it on the box but you DO get a Digital Copy of the film here as well for ""I Want to Believe"".Fox did an excellent job pulling the original extras and adding some nice new ones as part of the new package. Highly recommended although it MIGHT be more cost effective to buy this as the two Blu-ray set.",4,"Excellent twofer of the first X-Files movie with new extras, sharp transfer and the newer ""X-Files"" movie with excellent picture",1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,2985,"['really', 'nice', 'boxed', 'set', 'two', 'X-Files', 'movie', 'X', 'Files', 'Fight', 'Future', 'terrific', 'first', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'Fight', 'Future', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'more', 'recent', 'Want', 'Believe', 'Fight', 'Future', 'info', 'Fox', 'upgraded', 'Blu-ray', 'new', 'extras', 'including', 'new', 'featurette', 'new', 'PIP', 'commentary', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'Frank', 'Spotnitz', 'Daniel', 'Sackheim', 'Director', 'Rob', 'Bowman', 'also', 'get', 'gag', 'reel', 'everything', 'can', 'recall', 'original', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'high', 'def', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'unrated', 'DVD', 'version', 'BOTH', 'remastered', 'high', 'def', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'film', 'included.The', 'plot', 'SPOILERS', 'Set', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'season', 'TV', 'series', 'X', 'files', 'been', 'closed', 'down', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'have', 'been', 'reassigned', 'work', 'terrorist', 'threat', 'Texas', 'When', 'Mulder', 'hunch', 'bomb', 'DIFFERENT', 'building', ""'ve"", 'been', 'canvasing', 'More', 'importantly', 'doctor', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Mulder', 'were', 'little', 'boy', 'fireman', 'rescued', 'boy', 'was', 'infected', 'pathogen', 'bombed', 'building', 'were', 'already', 'DEAD', 'when', 'bomb', 'went', 'clearly', 'bombing', 'was', 'designed', 'cover', 'up', 'Fight', 'Future', 'strong', 'movie', 'key', 'episode', 'mythology', 'arc', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'Rob', 'Bowman', 'up', 'show', 'making', 'appropriate', 'big', 'screen', 'often', 'visually', 'dazzling', 'movie', 'top', 'notch', 'visual', 'effects', 'Want', 'Believe', 'Includes', 'featurettes', 'film', 'PIP', 'commentary', 'track', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'Frank', 'Spotnitz', 'as', 'well', 'full', 'blown', 'documentary', 'making', 'film.The', 'Plot', 'SPOILERS', 'Mulder', 'hiding', 'Scully', 'retirement', 'help', 'find', 'kidnapped', 'FBI', 'agent', 'experience', 'X-files', 'are', 'called', 'int', 'verify', 'disgraced', 'pedophile', 'priest', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'excellent', 'performance', 'indeed', 'psychic', 'know', 'FBI', 'agent', 'alive', 'having', 'visions', 'related', 'case.I', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'film', 'good', 'one', 'non-mythology', 'episodes', 'would', 'be', 'squeezed', 'key', 'episodes', 'smaller', 'more', 'intimate', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'expecting', 'Fight', 'Future', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'story', 'bit', 'muddled', 'times', 'bit', 'slow', 'paced', 'rewards.The', 'film', 'regardless', 'how', 'feel', 'excellent', 'crisp', 'image', ""n't"", 'digitally', 'overprocessed', 'extras', 'are', 'excellent', 'PIP', 'commentary', 'Carter', 'Spotnitz', 'full', 'length', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'gag', 'reel', ""n't"", 'say', 'box', 'DO', 'get', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'film', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Want', 'Believe', '.Fox', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'pulling', 'original', 'extras', 'adding', 'nice', 'new', 'ones', 'part', 'new', 'package', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'more', 'cost', 'effective', 'buy', 'two', 'Blu-ray', 'set']",The X-Files Movie: 2-Pack (Fight the Future / I Want to Believe)
