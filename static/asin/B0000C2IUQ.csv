""These are they"" is my ultimate favorite song sung by Bill,Guy,Russ,and David. They sing this song so beautifully together.

Great job and God's Blessing to all who sing on this dvd....",5,gaither homecoming,1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,429,"['definitely', 'one', 'best', 'one', 'own', 'love', 'music', 'talent', 'word', 'can', 'sing', 'are', 'ultimate', 'favorite', 'song', 'sung', 'Bill', 'Guy', 'Russ', 'David', 'sing', 'song', 'so', 'beautifully', 'together', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'hear', 'diversity', 'songs', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'then', 'just', 'dvd', 'buy', 'Great', 'job', 'God', 'Blessing', 'who', 'sing', 'dvd']",N/A
773086,A3D3AYY2YTWEVB,B0000C2IUQ,Mickey Thorne,"[1, 1]","ROCKY MOUNTAIN HOMECOMING has a pleasant beginning, and beautiful  scenery, which is panned often during the shooting. Though some songs are better than others, all the songs are good.There is something exceptionally relaxing about this DVD. The opening song has good lyrics. Gloria Gaither is a tremendous asset and a blessing to us who purchase these. Perhaps she and Bill Gaither are not always given due credit. Woody Wright's Back Home Again is really fun. Sweet Holy Spirit, by the Isaacs, is hard to describe, but wonderful to hear. ""When I Wake Up in Glory"" is uplifting. Jake Hess sings for us; he is so cute and funny. Gaither's love for Hess and Lester is touching, and it makes one appreciate those men, even though I did not know them and they are gone now. The music ends with ""These are They,"" and it is a great way to end it. The quartet is Guy, David, Russ and Bill in this one.  Good job everyone, and thank you for your good work.

It not only brought beautiful music to their home but humor.  It made my parents feel they were still in a community of believers.
