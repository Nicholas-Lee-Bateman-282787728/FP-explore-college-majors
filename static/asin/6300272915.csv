More than 25 years and it is still going strong! The ending of the movie is absolutely incredible, as the protagonists visit a strip club and view the delights of a voluptuous and mammothly-endowed BTC! I highly reccomend this rare DVD for any connoisseur of beautiful females.Here's the great news! The price has come down drastically from even just three months ago! The old DVDs that had initially been offered (One Still Is) may have been second hand or perhaps they were dubbed, who knows. The new DVDs appear to be legitimate studio productions and at the lower price are much more affordable. So if you are out there Mr. Cousin and Mr. Lightkeeper, they have affordable DVDs out on the market now that are brand new. I'm going to buy two more!A.

Robare ""smurfwreck""","[12, 13]","I have to say that I never saw the seminal (in every sense of the word) teen sex comedy Screwballs back in the 80s, and it was one heck of an oversight.  Screwballs is to teen sex comedies what Last House on the Left is to horror.  There are more naked girls, goofy horny guys, and inappropriate jokes than in most other 80s films combined.  In fact the raunch reaches a level of slapstick that is more on par with the feel of a crazy 30s era gag-a-second Fleischer cartoon than an 80s comedy.  The flick was also produced under Roger Corman, which might have something to do with its level of debauchery (but in the best sense of the word.)If you haven't seen it, the basic gist of the film revolves around a pact made by five senior guys who all have a beef with one girl, the ultimately virginal Purity Busch.  She's either gotten them in trouble or lead them on and the guys decide that by the end of the school year they'll either get to see her ""goods"" and score, or die trying.  Though the film should be qualified as terrible, where plot is really secondary to the mass amount of gags in the film, the set dressing keeps bouncing between the 50, 60s, 70s, and the 80s, and with acting that for the most part is insanely bad, it's still pretty great.  It's almost like watching a live action adaptation of a much dirtier version of MAD magazine that still manages to be funny.  Between sessions of strip bowling, insane make-out sessions a the drive-in, freshman breast exams, trips to the strip club (with a guest appearance by Russ Meyer star Raven DeLaCroix), ornate brainwashing attempts involving an giant fake hot dog, insanely inappropriate cheerleading practice in bikinis, and a milf mom who is playing the cougar to the point of being overdubbed with animal growls, you'll never be bored.I can honestly say that I was blown away by this long-overdue-on-DVD gem, for however contrived and clich&eacute; a statement like that can be.  I have to give a hand to Severin Films for taking the time and effort to restore this film (as well as stuff like the original Inglorious Bastards.)  The DVD looks pretty good for a lowbudget early 80s film like this, and has a nice set of special features including a commentary track as well as surprisingly insightful interviews with the director Rafal Zielinski and cast.
