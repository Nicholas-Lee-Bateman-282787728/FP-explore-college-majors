354090,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,6303059791,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[0, 0]","Kickboxer 2 followed up the first successful Kickboxer, but minus Van Damme.  David Sloan (played by Sasha Mitchell) is now the focus, the apparent 3rd brother of Kurt and Eric Sloan from the 1st movie.  Sasha Mitchell may not be anywhere as close to Van Damme in the athletic department, but that doesn't hurt Kickboxer 2 at all.  Sasha Mitchell is a better actor and as a whole, Kickboxer 2 does a better job than the 1st movie in that department.  The story is pretty decent too - this time both characters (good and evil) are out for revenge.  The evil is Tong Po, who returns from the 1st Kickboxer,  played by Michel Qissi.  He only has one line in the movie and doesn't appear until much later on, but it is a grand appearance.  Matthias Hues (Death Match, Blackbelt, No Retreat No Surrender 2) also has a role in the movie, fighting David early on in the ring, the 1st of 3 fights in the movie.  Vince Murdocco (Ring of Fire, To Be The Best) is also one of the main characters, who fights Tong Po, the 2nd fight in the movie.  This match is all in slow-motion, but it is the only slow motion fight I have ever enjoyed, creating a sense of suspense that supports a main element in the story.  The final fight of course is between David and Tong Po, which is about 5-1/2 minutes in length.  It is mostly slow-motion once again, but is still quite entertaining and bloody, with broken glass glued and taped to the fists (same used in the 1st Kickboxer).Kickboxer 1 is definetly a Van Damme classic.  Kickboxer 2 began a different path, but in no way did it succeed in being a bad martial-arts film.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","...and to answer a burning question: the Master from the original who returns here is the great Dennis Chan, who plays Master Chan, pronounced in Thai (according to the films) as ""Zee-ANN"", and whose real name is pronounced by his enemies in the original film as ""Chan Chow"". Dennis Chan is a Chinese actor and T'ai Ch'i master.Sasha Mitchell, who is sexy as hell in this film and has sadly vanished now, does justice playing a ridiculous role like this here. Being a brother to the Muscle-head from Brussels is no small task, especially since he is so obviously an afterthought of the producers. Did the parents know about this?To boil it down, Mitchell, a Muay Thai teacher who has barely hidden homosexual undertones, loses his star pupil (possibly his boyfriend) in a fire deliberately set at his school--set by his archenemy. Enter Master Chan, as I shall call him, fresh off the plane from Thailand and ready for action.Master Chan trains the boy after the fasion, of course, that Van Damme suffered. There is a lack of spirit, of eccentric exoticism, in Chan's performance here that really shone in the original film. I'm saddened by it though I always love seeing him again.If ""Kickboxer"" is your cup of tea, get this film too. DO NOT waste a second on any of the other sequels--so little do I care that I don't know if there was only a third movie or if there is a fourth, but I suspect there is a fourth.

But Tong Po is not so easily defeated and in a burst of rage guns down the champion as he prepares the leave Thailand. For Tong Po's manager Sangha, this is a disgrace he cannot bear, for the kickboxing championship can't be regained unless he can goad Kurt's younger brother David into the ring to fight Tong Po for the title. Under the watchful eye of his brother's trainer Xian he must enter the ring and face the lethal kickboxing skills of Tong Po, risking everything, including his life, to avenge the insane violence of the deadly Thai fighter.

JCVD was busy with other movies they could've waited for JCVD when he was done & they could've had a better script even but the  3 main characters have been wiped out characters we liked & cared about & our replacement is Cody Lambert from Step By Step woot & cliche characters yes the 1st was cliche but good directing & acting made it great. Michel Quissi returns but I felt he was used to less effect.  Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa & Peter Boyle were the only good actors in this Dennis Chan returns. The backstage stuff was good the soundtrack was good I'd be lying if I said it was bad I really enjoyed the songs in this movie.But there are few things that are good about Kickboxer 2. Tong Po was responsible for David's brother's deaths &  hejust wants to defeat the last Sloane brother David. They fight in an empty arena they didn't even do that good. As a standalone movie it might have been somewhat watchable. But as a sequel it's not even passable not even  passable.

Here're some directions the movie should have taken: they could have offered the title role to Mitchell's prize student or had a major try-out for a person to be either the guys' cousin or friend(that way, the best that they could afford gets the job), they could have offered the title role to Philip Rhee, Seagal, or Bruce Lee's son(Brandon), who was still living when this movie was made and made this person(whoever they chose) to be the brothers' cousin or friend bent on revenge. From the looks of the movie, the first option would have been best(very low budget). They needed to write a new fighting villain into the movie, as Tong Po looked like he wasn't in shape and his heart wasn't in it(they could have used ""TShang Tsung""--sorry don't know his real name--and some henchmen to kill David's brothers and his in-law; and, instead of Tshang Tsung championinging Tong Po, they should have subbed in another fighter. This movie needs a starting point(this movie doesn't get that right; he should have been a cousin or friend), a defribillating overhaul, and new directors/writers. The director and/or writer(s) seemed unresponsive and almost as if they weren't going to change anything that might make the movie better(almost as if they were just plain lazy or on an unreasonable schedule for making a good movie). Really the only good that I can say about it is that it needs to be improved in every conceivable area. They had a promising character(more gifted the Mitchell), who was tutored by Mitchell and the promoter or Freddie Lee like man(played Tshang Tsung in Mortal Kombat).

354097,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,6303059791,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","Not unlike Daniel Bernhardt inBloodsport 2, TV star Sasha Mitchell landed himself the tough gig of trying to live up to Jean-Claude Van Damme's performance in one of the defining martial arts films of the '80s. With two returning cast members from the original film, a script by Hollywood heavyweight David Goyer (Batman Begins), and with the undisputed king of trashy B-movies Albert Pyun (Cyborg) in the director's chair, Mitchell managed to remain entertaining for 90 minutes but failed from the get-go to be remembered as fondly as Van Damme is for his exploits. It's a good little kickboxing movie and definitely a better-than-average outing for director Pyun, but fans of the originalKickboxer, if they so choose, can ignore this spin-off adventure and not miss out anything that wasn't better in the first movie.The story: following the death of his brother Eric and the murder of his brother Kurt at the hands of the Thai ex-champion Tong Po (Michel Qissi), the last remaining Sloan brother - David (Mitchell,Step by Step) -takes over their inner city kickboxing gym and uses it as a haven for troubled youth. Upon turning down offers to reenter the kickboxing circuit by a greedy promoter (Peter Boyle,Everybody Loves Raymond) and Tong Po's nefarious manager (Cary Tagawa,Mortal Kombat) looking for a match between the ex-champ and the last remaining Sloan brother, David finds himself losing his best friend (Vince Murdocco,Ring of Fire) to the circuit and himself in the hospital following an attack on his gym. Debilitatingly wounded, he must accept the help from his late brother's teacher - the wise and comedic Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) - if he hopes to regain his confidence and put an end to the circuit's corruption.The one major fault that the film bears is that its ending comes way too fast: the film is of average length, but the inevitable confrontation between David and Tong Po comes at the end of what feels like a very short journey and with minimal preparation on David's part. Sure, there's a training montage, but it's nothing as remarkable and meaningful as Van Damme's excursions in the jungle. If you can get over that, though, the movie is pretty entertaining and solidly put-together for a Pyun picture. Both the protagonists and villains happily ham it up without delivering outright bad performances, and do so to the tune of one of the most outspokenly awesome '80s-sounding soundtracks I have ever heard. The sappy situations David finds himself in - whether it's opening his doors to a foul-mouthed homeless kid or teaching ethics to unscrupulous fight promoters - is the stuff that B-movies are made of but are so wholesomely entertaining in their earnest delivery that it's hard not to keep watching.Indeed, how entertained you are by the rest of the movie will determine whether or not you can forgive the film's fight content. No, it's not bad, but there just isn't a lot of it: not including a clean sparring session between Mitchell and Murdocco and a short montage of the latter, there are only three fights, featuring Mitchell, Murdocco, Tong Po, and B-movie baddie extraordinaire Matthias Hues (I Come in Peace). The quality of the fights (choreographed by Benny 'the Jet' Urquidez) ranges between good and decent, with good cinematography but no real technical know-how and the fact that the two Tong Po encounters are shot almost entirely in slow motion. The final David/Po showdown, despite featuring the former being beaten so bloody that he looks like a zombie, lacks the emotion and back-and-forth action of the original Van Damme fight, so there's a good chance that devotees of the first film will deem this one unfavorable for ending on a technical low note.However, anybody who was a bit put off by the exoticness of the first film may prefer this one for its close-to-home-ness; by the standards of traditionalists, it's definitely blander, but also a bit more accessible for folks who aren't crazy about Van Damme.

Cody from the television show Step by Step plays Van Damme's brother, David Sloane.  Apparently Van Damme's character was shot by Tong Po because Tong Po couldn't accept losing.  David doesn't want to fight because both of his brothers died from fighting.  But I thought his other brother was just crippled?  Anyways, David's school is going to close down because he can't pay the rent.  So he decides to fight.  He wins and then says that the kickboxing organization that Peter Boyle is running is crooked.  So Peter Boyle's character is obviously mad, and has David beat up.  Then Van Damme's teacher from the first movie comes back.  Why?  Because.  Seriously, ""because"" is the only reason I can come up with.  So all of a sudden Tong Po shows up and kills David's friend.  Maybe Van Damme's teacher from the first Kickboxer is a psychic and knew Tong Po was going to show up and that is why he came to train David?  But why did he look surprised when Tong Po showed up?Sound cheesy?  Ding ding ding!  You are right, it is very cheesy.

Well now you know how much stock you can put into a movie review from the L.A. times.Anyhow, what do you do when you can't lure Van Damme back to do your sequel?  Well, duh! Naturally you go and get Sasha Mitchell.  You also conveniently kill off Van Damme's character(Tong Po was a sore loser and killed him and apparently his brother and Dennis Chan's niece).  In this film, Sasha Mitchell plays the younger brother of Van Damme.  This doesn't make too much sense considering in the first film, Van Damme stated that his older brother(played by Dennis Alexio) was all the family he had.  Anyway, Mitchell runs a martial arts gym that's just on the verge of going under.  Seems that in Thailand they haven't been able to shake off the dishonor of having their best fighter losing to Van Damme, and want to regain it by having villain Tong Po come to America and fight with Mitchell.  By burning down his gym and other scare tactics, they finally get them both in the ring.  Dennis Chan, who trained Van Damme in the first film, is also lured to America to train Mitchell.  My God, who will win??  It's not without it's entertainment value, but it's not terribly good, and some of the scenarios are hard to swallow, even for a cheap action film.  Mitchell doesn't do too bad of a job and actually is a likable guy.  Peter Boyle has a constant look of, ""what the hell am I doing in this movie?"".  And Dennis Chan is just going through the motions, but isn't quite as charming this time around.  Once again, Tong Po is played by white guy in Asian makeup, Michel Quissi, and he seems to have lost some of his menace.  The movie was directed by schlockmeister, Albert Pyun, and that name speaks volumes if you're familiar with it.  The fight scenes are decent, but Pyun has this thing about playing them out almost entirely in slow motion.  Padding out running time perhaps?

354105,A9SROCMN7BRI1,6303059791,Vic P,"[0, 2]","Alot of people think this is better than the original Kickboxer, however, I really don't think so. First of all, I think they probably shouldn't have bothered making a sequel at all without Van Damme. I'm not really sure the exact reason why Van Damme didn't do a sequel, I'm guessing he either wanted too much money to do one, or he just wasn't interested in doing one at all. (Generally, Van Damme was just never really big on sequels.) Perhaps it was a combination of both reasons, who really knows for sure. Either way, I don't think they should have bothered.It's not that Sasha Mitchell(aka, Cody, the goofy kid from Step by Step) is bad in the lead role...in fact, he was very convincing, given his real-life Kickboxing experience...he just doesn't have the same style or coordination as Van Damme. On top of all that, the thing I find most irritating of all is that the writers felt the need to write in some really bad dialogue to explain what happened to Kurt and Eric Sloane from the previous movie. I was never a huge fan of the whole ""everybody from the past movie are all dead"" thing. By the time they got to Kickboxer 5, it was starting to get really ridiculous with this.The rest of the cast is a mix...Peter Boyle gave a decent performance, and Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa always gives a top notch performance in anything he is in. Hell, even Matthias Hughes(who plays villains in a variety of B-action movies) gave a decent performance, but some of the other supporting actors left alot to be desired. Whoever the guy was that played McKaia(or is it McKaya?), I forget the name, gave a pretty lousy performance, as did Vince Murdocco(Brian). As for the Tong Po in this version(credited as ""Michel Qissi""), I'm not sure whether or not it is the same Tong Po from the first movie, I don't think he is, as he looks a bit different, but he just seemed really weird in this version.If they were intent on making a sequel without Van Damme, then they could have at least tried. The movie started out with a goo plot, and solid foundation, however, after the first fight with David and Neil Vargas, the plot starts to jump all over the place. Tong Po and Sanga are introduced into the movie very late, even though they are the entire focus of the story towards the end. On top of less-than-stellar writing and story development, the fight scenes in this one were terrible. The last two fights in the movie were shown ENTIRELY in slow motion. By the end of the last fight between David and Tong Po, I felt like I was going to get vertigo if I watched it any longer. They were really stretching some things, too. I find it hard to believe that the fight would have gone on that long after Tong Po knocked the referee out. Is it a WWE wrestling match or what? Also, what makes even less sense is that David is escorted out of the building by about seven security guards, and then a few moments later he is magically back at ringside just in time to see Brian killed.As for the soundtrack, this movie had a couple decent songs; ""My Brother's Eyes,"" ""A Man Alone,"" ""It's All up to You,"" however, once again the movie falls short in comparison to the first Kickboxer in this aspect. For those who did enjoy the soundtrack, good luck finding those tracks, as since a Kickboxer 2 soundtrack was never commercially released, those tracks are virtually impossible to get.Even though I don't necessarily think this movie was great, I think it was at least better than some of the other Kickboxer sequels. It wasn't as bad as the third one(which was probably the worst of the series), and it couldn't possibly be as bad as Kickboxer 4, with plastic-face Tong Po and a plot that made virtually no sense. As for Kickboxer 5(which was ironically a half-remake of Kickboxer 2), it was actually decent, given the talents of Mark Dacascos, and better writers.All in all I think this was a poor sequel and they shouldn't have bothered.",3,They shouldn't have bothered without Van Damme...,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,3920,"['Alot', 'people', 'think', 'better', 'original', 'Kickboxer', 'however', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'First', 'think', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'making', 'sequel', 'Van', 'Damme', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'exact', 'reason', 'why', 'Van', 'Damme', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'sequel', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'either', 'wanted', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'do', 'one', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'doing', 'one', 'Generally', 'Van', 'Damme', 'was', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'big', 'sequels', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'combination', 'reasons', 'who', 'really', 'sure', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'have', 'bothered.It', 'not', 'Sasha', 'Mitchell', 'aka', 'Cody', 'goofy', 'kid', 'Step', 'Step', 'bad', 'lead', 'role', 'fact', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'given', 'real-life', 'Kickboxing', 'experience', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'style', 'coordination', 'Van', 'Damme', 'top', 'thing', 'find', 'most', 'irritating', 'writers', 'felt', 'need', 'write', 'really', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'Kurt', 'Eric', 'Sloane', 'previous', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'fan', 'whole', 'everybody', 'past', 'movie', 'are', 'dead', 'thing', 'time', 'got', 'Kickboxer', '5', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'this.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'mix', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'gave', 'decent', 'performance', 'Cary', 'Hiroyuki', 'Tagawa', 'always', 'top', 'notch', 'performance', 'anything', 'Hell', 'even', 'Matthias', 'Hughes', 'who', 'villains', 'variety', 'B-action', 'movies', 'gave', 'decent', 'performance', 'other', 'supporting', 'actors', 'left', 'alot', 'be', 'desired', 'Whoever', 'guy', 'was', 'played', 'McKaia', 'McKaya', 'forget', 'name', 'gave', 'pretty', 'lousy', 'performance', 'did', 'Vince', 'Murdocco', 'Brian', 'Tong', 'Po', 'version', 'credited', 'Michel', 'Qissi', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'not', 'same', 'Tong', 'Po', 'first', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bit', 'different', 'just', 'seemed', 'really', 'weird', 'version.If', 'were', 'intent', 'making', 'sequel', 'Van', 'Damme', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'tried', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'goo', 'plot', 'solid', 'foundation', 'however', 'first', 'fight', 'David', 'Neil', 'Vargas', 'plot', 'jump', 'place', 'Tong', 'Po', 'Sanga', 'are', 'introduced', 'movie', 'very', 'late', 'even', 'are', 'entire', 'focus', 'story', 'end', 'top', 'less-than-stellar', 'writing', 'story', 'development', 'fight', 'scenes', 'one', 'were', 'terrible', 'last', 'two', 'fights', 'movie', 'were', 'shown', 'ENTIRELY', 'slow', 'motion', 'end', 'last', 'fight', 'David', 'Tong', 'Po', 'felt', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'vertigo', 'watched', 'longer', 'were', 'really', 'stretching', 'things', 'too', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'fight', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'Tong', 'Po', 'knocked', 'referee', 'WWE', 'wrestling', 'match', 'what', 'Also', 'what', 'even', 'less', 'sense', 'David', 'escorted', 'building', 'seven', 'security', 'guards', 'then', 'few', 'moments', 'later', 'magically', 'back', 'ringside', 'just', 'time', 'see', 'Brian', 'killed.As', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'had', 'couple', 'decent', 'songs', 'Brother', 'Eyes', 'A', 'Man', 'Alone', 'up', 'however', 'once', 'again', 'movie', 'short', 'comparison', 'first', 'Kickboxer', 'aspect', 'who', 'did', 'enjoy', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'luck', 'finding', 'tracks', 'Kickboxer', '2', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'never', 'commercially', 'released', 'tracks', 'are', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'get.Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'think', 'was', 'least', 'better', 'other', 'Kickboxer', 'sequels', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'third', 'one', 'was', 'probably', 'worst', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'Kickboxer', '4', 'plastic-face', 'Tong', 'Po', 'plot', 'made', 'virtually', 'sense', 'Kickboxer', '5', 'was', 'ironically', 'half-remake', 'Kickboxer', '2', 'was', 'actually', 'decent', 'given', 'talents', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'better', 'writers.All', 'think', 'was', 'poor', 'sequel', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered']",N/A
