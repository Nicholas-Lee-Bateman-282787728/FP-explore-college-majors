289792,A1I1GC24YNZJO2,6302000483,A. Ryan,"[35, 35]","Those are the immortal words of the mystical Jeweller in this film, played wonderfully by Burt Lancaster. Based on the international best-selling book by Pope John Paul II, this film has an excellent cast of Lancaster, Olivia Hussey and Ben Cross. It gives a realistic portrayal of the struggles and the triumphs in the marriages of three couples, showing that the the union of man & woman in marriage is that mysterious mix of freedom, love, sacrifice, and grace. It is a touching and lovely film, while still portraying the sorrows and challenges in married life. The Pope had some very positive things to say about this film. It does make one want to go read his book, which I have read, and it is a little jewel itself. This is the second to last film for the legendary Burt Lancaster.",5,The Future Depends on Love,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,789,"['are', 'immortal', 'words', 'mystical', 'Jeweller', 'film', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Based', 'international', 'best-selling', 'book', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'film', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Lancaster', 'Olivia', 'Hussey', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'struggles', 'triumphs', 'marriages', 'three', 'couples', 'showing', 'union', 'man', 'woman', 'marriage', 'mysterious', 'mix', 'freedom', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'grace', 'touching', 'lovely', 'film', 'still', 'portraying', 'sorrows', 'challenges', 'married', 'life', 'Pope', 'had', 'very', 'positive', 'things', 'say', 'film', 'make', 'one', 'want', 'go', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'little', 'jewel', 'second', 'last', 'film', 'legendary', 'Burt', 'Lancaster']",N/A

I was pleased that his acting was as good in this as in the &#34;Anne&#34; series.  The message in this story, that love is the answer (to many problems, not just the one depicted here) was presented in such a way that I found it difficult to sort through the storyline to find it.  The message, when understood, was a good one.Burt Lancaster had a very small role in the story, yet he was promoted as the star player.  To be honest, I had a difficult time understanding his contribution and the meaning of his words.  I would have appreciated a better attempt at character development, to better understand some of the underlying issues that were alluded to.  Having said that, the movie was an attempt to deliver the important message about love.  I sincerely hope that anyone watching this would continue to seek for more in-depth guidance as to just what that love looks like and how it's lived out.",3,could have been better,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1056,"['bought', 'movie', 'discovered', 'Jonathan', 'Crombie', 'was', 'one', 'actors', 'wanted', 'see', 'something', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'was', 'pleased', 'acting', 'was', 'as', 'good', '34', 'Anne', '34', 'series', 'message', 'story', 'love', 'answer', 'many', 'problems', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'depicted', 'here', 'was', 'presented', 'such', 'way', 'found', 'difficult', 'sort', 'storyline', 'find', 'message', 'when', 'understood', 'was', 'good', 'one.Burt', 'Lancaster', 'had', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'story', 'was', 'promoted', 'star', 'player', 'be', 'honest', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'understanding', 'contribution', 'meaning', 'words', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'better', 'attempt', 'character', 'development', 'better', 'understand', 'underlying', 'issues', 'were', 'alluded', 'Having', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'attempt', 'deliver', 'important', 'message', 'love', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'anyone', 'watching', 'would', 'continue', 'seek', 'more', 'in-depth', 'guidance', 'just', 'what', 'love', 'looks', 'how', 'lived', 'out']",N/A

289796,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,6302000483,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[2, 2]","This quiet little film is the sweetly inspiring dramatization of a three-act play written by Cardinal Karol Wojtyla (the future Pope John Paul II) in Poland in 1960. Wojtyla, who had been a student theatrical actor when the Nazi occupation closed his university in 1939, proceeded with a group of like-minded college friends to create the underground ""Rhapsodic Theater"" to preserve Polish culture during the war. After his father's death in 1941, he entered an underground seminary to train for the priesthood, but his love of theater stayed with him. He wrote this play under a pseudonym in 1960, when Communist Poland was in its heyday, and it's helpful to recall his WWII experiences when viewing this film.This movie tells the story of two young Polish couples who marry in 1939, one of them staying in Poland while the other couple moves to Canada, and of a young Wojtyla-style priest who is their friend. Years later, the children of these two couples (one of which is separated by death while the other is estranged in their marriage) fall in love with each other, setting up an exploration of the true meaning of love. Wojtyla's theology of the body, a chaste view of sexuality that prioritizes respect for the opposite sex and for God's gift of human love, is thoughtfully explored in this teleplay. Actually, the film is surprisingly good for a stage-bound drama, offering decent location footage of Krakow and sensitive performances by Ben Cross and Olivia Hussey as two of the young spouses in 1939. Burt Lancaster also scores points for his warm portrayal of a mysterious jeweler in Poland who runs the titular shop where he sells the young couples their wedding rings, only to crop up again later in the story in a surprising way.The screenplay is quite original in taking the play, which is essentially a series of monologues by the central characters, and cleverly transposing it into a dialogue-driven narrative storyline. Ultimately, the message of this film is that true love is deeper than physical attraction, and it's a painful lesson that we fail to learn at the peril of our children and the well-being of our families. But the good news is that children may still learn from the mistakes of their parents' failed marriages and create more lasting relationships, for love is the future of the human race. One feels the spirit of the late pope's joyful optimism about the human condition in every frame of this strangely moving wisp of a movie. It's not Shakespeare, but it's a very heartfelt and moving little film, and you'll be surprised just how much it touches you by the end if you watch with careful attention. It really feels like JPII's ideas on human love from ""Theology of the Body"" come to life on the screen here. I recommend it to anyone who wants to reflect more deeply on the nature of love within marriages and families.",5,Sweet & quietly inspiring family drama based on play by John Paul II,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,2861,"['quiet', 'little', 'film', 'sweetly', 'inspiring', 'dramatization', 'three-act', 'play', 'written', 'Cardinal', 'Karol', 'Wojtyla', 'future', 'Pope', 'John', 'Paul', 'II', 'Poland', '1960', 'Wojtyla', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'student', 'theatrical', 'actor', 'when', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'closed', 'university', '1939', 'proceeded', 'group', 'like-minded', 'college', 'friends', 'create', 'underground', 'Rhapsodic', 'Theater', 'preserve', 'Polish', 'culture', 'war', 'father', 'death', '1941', 'entered', 'underground', 'seminary', 'train', 'priesthood', 'love', 'theater', 'stayed', 'wrote', 'play', 'pseudonym', '1960', 'when', 'Communist', 'Poland', 'was', 'heyday', 'helpful', 'recall', 'WWII', 'experiences', 'when', 'viewing', 'film.This', 'movie', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'Polish', 'couples', 'who', 'marry', '1939', 'one', 'staying', 'Poland', 'other', 'couple', 'moves', 'Canada', 'young', 'Wojtyla-style', 'priest', 'who', 'friend', 'Years', 'later', 'children', 'two', 'couples', 'one', 'separated', 'death', 'other', 'estranged', 'marriage', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'setting', 'up', 'exploration', 'true', 'meaning', 'love', 'Wojtyla', 'theology', 'body', 'chaste', 'view', 'sexuality', 'respect', 'opposite', 'sex', 'God', 'gift', 'human', 'love', 'thoughtfully', 'explored', 'teleplay', 'Actually', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'stage-bound', 'drama', 'offering', 'decent', 'location', 'footage', 'Krakow', 'sensitive', 'performances', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'Olivia', 'Hussey', 'two', 'young', 'spouses', '1939', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'also', 'points', 'warm', 'portrayal', 'mysterious', 'jeweler', 'Poland', 'who', 'titular', 'shop', 'where', 'young', 'couples', 'wedding', 'rings', 'only', 'crop', 'up', 'again', 'later', 'story', 'surprising', 'way.The', 'screenplay', 'quite', 'original', 'taking', 'play', 'essentially', 'series', 'monologues', 'central', 'characters', 'cleverly', 'transposing', 'dialogue-driven', 'narrative', 'storyline', 'Ultimately', 'message', 'film', 'true', 'love', 'deeper', 'physical', 'attraction', 'painful', 'lesson', 'fail', 'learn', 'peril', 'children', 'well-being', 'families', 'good', 'news', 'children', 'may', 'still', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'parents', 'failed', 'marriages', 'create', 'more', 'lasting', 'relationships', 'love', 'future', 'human', 'race', 'One', 'spirit', 'late', 'pope', 'joyful', 'optimism', 'human', 'condition', 'frame', 'strangely', 'moving', 'wisp', 'movie', 'not', 'Shakespeare', 'very', 'heartfelt', 'moving', 'little', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'end', 'watch', 'careful', 'attention', 'really', 'JPII', 'ideas', 'human', 'love', 'Theology', 'Body', 'come', 'life', 'screen', 'here', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'reflect', 'more', 'deeply', 'nature', 'love', 'marriages', 'families']",N/A
