1280834,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B002OD2HTS,Edmonson,"[1, 1]","""The Man From London"" (2007) is directed by Bela Tarr (Satantango, Turin Horse). This very slowly paced film is about a man who works in a watch tower overlooking a harbour area. One night he views a murder that is committed below him and he fishes out of the water the dead man's suitcase of money. Even though Bela Tarr is a realist his pictures have something of the surreal about them sometimes reminding one of a David Lynch film.  The sparse dialogue and minimal plot and foreboding drone of sounds gives one a heightened sense of always being on edge, waiting for something to happen. Bela Tarr's world is a nightmarish world on the very edges of our known reality. This film owes something to the film noir genre though the general lack of drama and plot put this film more in the realm of a minimalist's purgatory as if one is waiting apprehensively for final judgement. Lock yourself up in a dark room for two hours and let the droning malaise of modernity wash over you.This DVD has no special features, and it is generally very good video quality though there is a ten minute segment that was filmed without strong contrast for no apparent reason except that it was poorly photographed.",4,A film of foreboding...,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,1198,"['Man', 'London', '2007', 'directed', 'Bela', 'Tarr', 'Satantango', 'Turin', 'Horse', 'very', 'slowly', 'paced', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'watch', 'tower', 'overlooking', 'harbour', 'area', 'One', 'night', 'murder', 'committed', 'water', 'dead', 'man', 'suitcase', 'money', 'Even', 'Bela', 'Tarr', 'realist', 'pictures', 'have', 'something', 'surreal', 'sometimes', 'reminding', 'one', 'David', 'Lynch', 'film', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'minimal', 'plot', 'foreboding', 'drone', 'sounds', 'one', 'heightened', 'sense', 'always', 'being', 'edge', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'Bela', 'Tarr', 'world', 'nightmarish', 'world', 'very', 'edges', 'known', 'reality', 'film', 'something', 'film', 'noir', 'genre', 'general', 'lack', 'drama', 'plot', 'put', 'film', 'more', 'realm', 'minimalist', 'purgatory', 'one', 'waiting', 'apprehensively', 'final', 'judgement', 'Lock', 'up', 'dark', 'room', 'two', 'hours', 'let', 'droning', 'malaise', 'modernity', 'wash', 'you.This', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'video', 'quality', 'ten', 'minute', 'segment', 'was', 'filmed', 'strong', 'contrast', 'apparent', 'reason', 'was', 'poorly', 'photographed']",N/A

It's like watching T'ai Chi.  90 continuous minutes of it.  There are several fine acting scenes with enough drama in them help you recall that you are in fact watching a movie as opposed to practicing Zen meditation.  There are moments of photographic beauty as well - lots of them, but if you are looking for something interesting in terms of an engaging story, you've come to the wrong place.  Actually, noir buffs may get into it.  The story is basically about a man who finds money in a suitcase from a guy who was bumped off (he witnessed the crime from a distance).  Man later finds the money.  He wants to buy nice things for his daughter and take her away from her menial job.  Man's wife thinks he's gone mad.  Meanwhile, the inspector has come down to do a little investigating and the tension builds slowly (OH SO SLOWLY) as the story proceeds toward an ending which, if not exciting, was at least not predictable (though neither was it entirely clear what happened).

1280836,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B002OD2HTS,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[1, 1]","This is probably what could be described as a minor Tarr film, but a minor Tarr film stands above the major films of most modern directors.  This film isn't as brooding or as magisterial as Satantango or Werckmeister Harmonies, but it's still worth watching and has some truly amazing scenes within its walls.It's based on a Georges Simeon novel, and while the novel and plot are pretty standard, the vision that Tarr brings to this film makes it what it is.  The opening shot lasts nearly 12 minutes, giving this film a brilliant dirge like atmosphere throughout.  The black and white photography is wonderous.  There are shots in this film that are so precise and exacting you marvel at Tarr's artistry (and those of his crew).  The performances are also first rate in this film.  There is one tremendous scene where the police inspector informs a woman that her husband is involved with nefarious people, and Tarr brilliantly leaves the camera on her face while the inspector is talking.  The woman's eyes do all the acting, and it's one of the best scenes in any of Tarr's work.  Several Tarr regulars (if you can call them that, as Tarr isn't very prolific) appear, and there are some humourous scenes in the film as well.  Tarr often gets spoken of in deeply solemn tones (like Tarkovsky and Bresson), but there is humour in every film he's done.The Man from London isn't Tarr's best, but anyone who has enjoyed his work should see it regardless.  See it though in the original Hungarian soundtrack.  There is a theatrical version going around that's been dubbed into English and French, and it's not that good.  It's not a horrible retro flashback to some of the atrocious dubbing like there used to be, but in this day and age, arthouse audiences expect the original language with subtitles, even if some of the actors/actresses are dubbed into that language (Tilda Swinton is dubbed into Hungarian in the original version, for example).  Regardless, Tarr's The Man from London is a very good film.

1280838,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002OD2HTS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[14, 15]","The Man from London (Bela Tarr and Agnes Hranitzky, 2007)Every director has a weakness. Bela Tarr's has always been plot. His best movies (and the best movies of Bela Tarr, one of the best directors working today, are some of the best movies of all time) are those where plot is almost a non-consideration, where he focuses on the characters and their reactions to seemingly mundane situations. Both Satantango and Werckmeister Harmonies fall into this category. On the other hand, we have Tarr's excursions into the world of the crime film, Karozhat and The Man from London. While they are both still worth watching, neither approaches the brilliance of the two aforementioned; as it so often does, plot gets in the way.Adapted by longtime Tarr collaborator Laszlo Krasznahorkai from a novel by Georges Simenon, The Man from London opens with one of those wonderful scenes that Tarr inherited by way of Tarkovsky. It runs fully fifteen minutes, and while the camera does move to take in different parts of the scene, it is for the most part stationary. If you're enough of a Tarr fan to have grokked the whole ""endless scene"" thing, you might not even notice that there is action. But there is. Maloin (The Country Teacher's Miroslav Krobot) is the harbormaster in a nameless seaside town in France. (I seem to recall someone saying this is Paris, but please. This is Tarr's nameless rural Hungarian town transported to France.) One night, he's watching people disembarking as usual, going through customs, when one passenger, Brown (Janos Derszi, returning from Werckmeister Harmonies), doesn't get on the train as most do. Instead, he goes around the other side of the boat and waits in the darkness. Another man, Teddy, throws a case off the side of the ship before disembarking himself, and Brown retrieves it. We pan over to the train, which slowly pulls out of the station. (In the way these things tend to feed off one another, this shot made me wonder if Tarr had seen Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire, with the opening credits dissolving into the long, slow shot of the train's wheels.) We head back over, and we find Brown and Teddy struggling over the case. Brown pushes Teddy into the water. Teddy drowns, taking the case with him. Brown walks away. And then comes scene two, where Maloin sets the events of the rest of the film in motion by going out and retrieving the case, which turns out to be full of money. He hides it, intending to get his wife Camelia (Tilda Swinton) and daughter Henriette (Erika Bok, whose role in Satantango will likely never be forgotten by anyone who's seen that film) out of their ramshackle flat, but a monkeywrench is thrown into the works when Morrison (A Long Weekend in Pest and Buda's Istvan Lenart), the Man from London, appears looking for the case. He knows immediately that Brown took it, and goes as far as bringing Brown's wife (Hungarian Beauty's Agi Szirtes) in to help look for him. All the while, Maloin goes on about his business, playing chess with the local bar owner (Gyula Pauer, another returnee from Werckmeister Harmonies) and sitting in his tower, drinking vodka and watching the ships.My wife is not a Bela Tarr fan, and so when we talked about the movie afterwards, I got a fresh perspective. She brought some things to the fore that I'd always noticed, but kind of shuffled to the back of my mind. Most notably that everyone in Bela Tarr's movies ranges from the aggressively plain to the monstrously ugly. I wouldn't go so far as to call Tarr's movies cinema verite--they are far too composed for that--but it has always struck me that Tarr's lack of movie-star-looking folk is one of the hallmarks he uses to tell us that while his movies are obviously choreographed, there's more of reality to them than there is to anything turned out by Holly/Bolly/Nollywood and their imitators. Similarly those long, long shots, which are often long to the point of uncomfortability; it's another way of looking at Maloin playing chess while Morrison is interrogating Brown in the other room. It's a way of saying ""life goes on."" And it does.One thing that really impressed me about this, and the thing that makes me think that Tarr really could turn in a fine crime film at some point, is the paradox that the long shots, which are often so full of nothing, fill the movie with a tension that is at times well nigh unbearable. There's so much nothing going on at points in this movie that you know there's a shoe about to drop. That it never does (I have often said that Tarr's films usually turn around one shocking piece of violence; I don't think it's a spoiler to say that in the case of The Man from London, it's the initial fight between Brown and Teddy, which is mirrored later when Maloin is attempting to extricate Henriette from her job) just keeps the tension ramping up. I have no idea how that works, and it's something that, of all the long-shot directors, Tarr does best. Maloin undresses and goes to bed, and Camelia comes in and closes the shutters in the bedroom. It's black. And it stays black for about a minute. You know something is going to happen. And you keep knowing it, even as nothing does. It makes no sense, but it works.And forgive me for going on and on about this movie, especially when I'm giving it a middling rating, but talking to my wife about it afterwards got me going about the brilliance that is Bela Tarr. Every shot means something. Every decision means something. And it's all lovely, even the ugly bits. I adore the film stock he uses, that washed-out black-and-white stuff probably left over from the fifties that looks almost silver when projected. I love the way he pans off to someone who has no bearing whatsoever on the story so we can watch him eat bread and soup for two minutes. (What does it mean? Once again, that life goes on.) I even love the fact that this movie was originally filmed in Hungarian (and one wonders whether Swinton learned Hungarian, or whether she did her dialogue in English), dubbed into French on Tarr's orders, and then subtitled into English. I love Tilda Swinton in this movie, who gives the same odd disconnect that Lars Rudolph (well-known to American audiences from Lola Rennt) did in Werckmeister Harmonies; you see all these Hungarian players in Tarr films, people that we in the Western world wouldn't know unless we're far deeper into Eastern European film than most American viewers are capable of getting, and then all the sudden--Tilda Swinton! A recognizable face in a Bela Tarr movie? It makes no sense, and that makes it all the more enjoyable. (And what's more, a recognizable face in a minor role? And playing, if the film really has one, the bad guy? It's delicious casting.)David Thomson, in his Werckmeister Harmonies entry in Have You Seen...?, closes with a paragraph about how Tarr's films look to the universal. I disagree with that assessment; Tarr's movies, be they the plotless wonders that are destined for classic status or the relatively minor crime films, have always struck me as intensely personal, intimate pictures. They resonate because even if you've never been to Hungary or France, you've walked these streets, talked to these ugly people (or made fun of them behind their backs), watched them in the drudgery of their work. Maybe that's what Thomson's on about; the universality of the personal, or some such nonsense. In any case, every Bela Tarr film I've seen feels like he made it just for me. And just for you. And just for etc.The Man from London is not by any means Tarr's best work. Start with Werckmeister Harmonies. I'd tell you to start with Satantango, but that is a big, big investment for a first exposure. Go to that one second. And then watch The Man from London and Karozhat (which was recently released as a double-feature DVD with Werckmeister). I think they'll make a bit more sense once you've got a solid footing in the absurd, and yet utterly real, universe that Bela Tarr inhabits. ***",3,"One day, Bela Tarr will make a great noir.

1280839,A3N7TVOTK6QHJM,B002OD2HTS,Un francais en angleterre,"[0, 0]","I had read bad critics about this movie, but I had a hard time believing that the man who gave us Satantango and the Werckmeister Harmonies could come up with a lemon. This is not quite a lemon, but this is also very far from the 2 aforementioned movies. The first scenes are pretty good and raised my hopes. There's something enigmatic going on and the geography of the small city in which the film takes place seems to be an invitation for more enigma (and most importantly for the addicts among us, it also seems to be a promise for more memerizing panning shots). And then, inexplicably things fall flat.
