Where the movie falls down is when the soldiers get back to Texas, and are being phased out of the Army. That crucial part of the movie did not ring true, nor did the ending, which I won't give away. I can't believe the Army would be so cavalier as to have a low level clerk tell a decorated non-com they are being stop lossed. That news should have been delivered by the platoon leader. But I could be wrong - maybe the Army is that cold blooded. Other than that, this movie was solid although it could have done without the requisite bar scenes, and the movie lost continuity when it shifted twice during critical scenes back to the secondary stories of those who were not impacted by the stop loss. Too bad this movie didn't get wider play -it is an indictment of the Bush Administration trying to keep up our troop level committments without resorting to a draft.",3,Good but not great,1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,979,"['Stop', 'Loss', 'tried', 'hard', 'get', 'emotional', 'impact', 'fighting', 'Iraq', 'right', 'think', 'succeeded', 'Where', 'movie', 'down', 'when', 'soldiers', 'get', 'back', 'Texas', 'are', 'being', 'phased', 'Army', 'crucial', 'part', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'did', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Army', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'cavalier', 'have', 'low', 'level', 'clerk', 'tell', 'decorated', 'non-com', 'are', 'being', 'stop', 'lossed', 'news', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'delivered', 'platoon', 'leader', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'maybe', 'Army', 'cold', 'blooded', 'Other', 'movie', 'was', 'solid', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'requisite', 'bar', 'scenes', 'movie', 'lost', 'continuity', 'when', 'shifted', 'twice', 'critical', 'scenes', 'back', 'secondary', 'stories', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'impacted', 'stop', 'loss', 'Too', 'bad', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'wider', 'play', '-it', 'indictment', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'troop', 'level', 'committments', 'resorting', 'draft']",Stop-Loss
1141942,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0013FSL1Q,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","This movie had a lot going for it.  First of all, Kimberly Pierce's debut film `Boys Don't Cry' is one of the best films of the 90's and is hauntingly realistic in its approach to a taboo subject.  Pierce proved she had talent but also that she had the gravitas to carry a film of that weight with respectable intensity and honesty.  Her hands in a project of this nature should have meant something.  Then you have the cast; a who's-who of young talent.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been on the upswing for years now and he is only getting better.  Abbie Cornish is considered something special by some, and her performance in `Bright Star' was uncannily excellent.  Channing Tatum is one of those actors who oozes charisma and just draws you to him.  The weak link here is obviously Ryan Phillippe, and yet he's always been at least engaging even when he wasn't really `acting'.  Then you have the subject.  War is very tricky, especially when you are depicting a war that is so current and so fresh in the minds of millions.  This is something that cannot be taken lightly, no matter what your stand is on the matter.  Honestly, all of these elements should have come together to produce something sacred and yet...It didn't.From the opening segments that contain teen angst music crushing down over a series of depictions of war-like violence and soldier comradery, it becomes evident that this film isn't taking itself seriously.  It's trying to make something stylized and engaging for a typical audience; the MTV crowd.  This isn't smart fare but dumbed down to draw in an audience that doesn't know the difference.""Cool man, Ryan Phillippe is so mad that he has to go back to Iraq, so he punched out that other soldier and went AWOL!""""Dude, Channing Tatum would so kick Ryan Phillippe's ***!""""Whoop, whoop, yah, let's kill some Iraqis!""The plot breakdown feels contrived and uninspired.  They really didn't think this through enough to create something that felt realistic.  Instead, each and every situation feels disjointed and presented solely to convey a desired effect that isn't in the least bit probable.  The depictions of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder feel overdone, especially when everyone seems to suffer from the same issues.  There is no diversity and so everything feels instilled to get our sympathies up.  Some of the points are picked up and then dropped with no explanation, causing one to wonder just why they were addressed in the first place.  And then you have the whole `stop-loss' situation and the drastic measures taken by Phillippe's character, which make no sense.  On top of that, (because I understand that dramatic embellishments are necessary at times to create cinematic tension) the handling of the character arc is ridiculous.  The end is so convoluted it's embarrassing.But that isn't the worst of it.The character development in general is horrible.  None of these characters are the least bit interesting, and their relationships don't make sense.  They are just angry and hit each other all the time, yell and demean and criticize.  But they're best friends.  The film made our soldiers look like a bunch of hooligans who don't even begin to understand the meaning of their profession.  Say what you will about war itself (I personally don't support the idea), but there has to be honor found in order to create something human.  The approach here made the war and those involved look like a joke, and not in a profound or subjective way.  They just threw this away.And then you have those horrid performances given but Cornish and Phillippe that just made me want to vomit.This film is a waste, a total disgusting waste, which is sad because it had promise on paper that turn, quickly, into trash.",1,War: MTV style...,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,3744,"['movie', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'First', 'Kimberly', 'Pierce', 'debut', 'film', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'one', 'best', 'films', '90', 'hauntingly', 'realistic', 'approach', 'taboo', 'subject', 'Pierce', 'proved', 'had', 'talent', 'also', 'had', 'gravitas', 'carry', 'film', 'weight', 'respectable', 'intensity', 'honesty', 'hands', 'project', 'nature', 'should', 'have', 'meant', 'something', 'Then', 'have', 'cast', ""who's-who"", 'young', 'talent', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'been', 'upswing', 'years', 'now', 'only', 'getting', 'better', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'considered', 'something', 'special', 'performance', 'Bright', 'Star', 'was', 'uncannily', 'excellent', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'oozes', 'charisma', 'just', 'draws', 'weak', 'link', 'here', 'obviously', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'yet', 'always', 'been', 'least', 'engaging', 'even', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'acting', 'Then', 'have', 'subject', 'War', 'very', 'tricky', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'depicting', 'war', 'so', 'current', 'so', 'fresh', 'minds', 'millions', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'matter', 'what', 'stand', 'matter', 'Honestly', 'elements', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'together', 'produce', 'something', 'sacred', 'yet', 'opening', 'segments', 'contain', 'teen', 'angst', 'music', 'crushing', 'down', 'series', 'depictions', 'war-like', 'violence', 'soldier', 'comradery', 'evident', 'film', ""n't"", 'taking', 'seriously', 'trying', 'make', 'something', 'stylized', 'engaging', 'typical', 'audience', 'MTV', 'crowd', ""n't"", 'smart', 'fare', 'dumbed', 'down', 'draw', 'audience', ""n't"", 'know', 'difference', 'Cool', 'man', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'so', 'mad', 'go', 'back', 'Iraq', 'punched', 'out', 'other', 'soldier', 'went', 'AWOL', 'Dude', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'would', 'so', 'kick', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', '***', 'Whoop', 'whoop', 'yah', 'let', 'kill', 'Iraqis', 'plot', 'breakdown', 'feels', 'contrived', 'uninspired', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'enough', 'create', 'something', 'felt', 'realistic', 'Instead', 'situation', 'feels', 'disjointed', 'presented', 'solely', 'convey', 'desired', 'effect', ""n't"", 'least', 'bit', 'probable', 'depictions', 'Post-Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'feel', 'overdone', 'especially', 'when', 'everyone', 'suffer', 'same', 'issues', 'diversity', 'so', 'everything', 'feels', 'instilled', 'get', 'sympathies', 'up', 'points', 'are', 'picked', 'then', 'dropped', 'explanation', 'causing', 'one', 'wonder', 'just', 'why', 'were', 'addressed', 'first', 'place', 'then', 'have', 'whole', 'stop-loss', 'situation', 'drastic', 'measures', 'taken', 'Phillippe', 'character', 'make', 'sense', 'top', 'understand', 'dramatic', 'embellishments', 'are', 'necessary', 'times', 'create', 'cinematic', 'tension', 'handling', 'character', 'arc', 'ridiculous', 'end', 'so', 'convoluted', 'embarrassing.But', ""n't"", 'worst', 'it.The', 'character', 'development', 'general', 'horrible', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'least', 'bit', 'interesting', 'relationships', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'just', 'angry', 'hit', 'other', 'time', 'yell', 'demean', 'criticize', ""'re"", 'best', 'friends', 'film', 'made', 'soldiers', 'look', 'bunch', 'hooligans', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'understand', 'meaning', 'profession', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'about', 'war', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'support', 'idea', 'there', 'be', 'honor', 'found', 'order', 'create', 'something', 'human', 'approach', 'here', 'made', 'war', 'involved', 'look', 'joke', 'not', 'profound', 'subjective', 'way', 'just', 'threw', 'away.And', 'then', 'have', 'horrid', 'performances', 'given', 'Cornish', 'Phillippe', 'just', 'made', 'want', 'vomit.This', 'film', 'waste', 'total', 'disgusting', 'waste', 'sad', 'had', 'promise', 'paper', 'turn', 'quickly', 'trash']",Stop-Loss

He was about go awhol, but well... see the movie. Its really good.Joseph Gordon Levitt, (give me a minute while I swoon) I met him at valley college years ago, and have been in love IN LOVE with him ever since, he is a really cool and down to earth guy. OMG,my heart is beating really fast.  I need an asprin.  OK, Im good.  Joe, is a troubled military guy who cant seem to control both his violence and his temper.  He is having a really tough time readjusting to life away from the battle field, and it just gets to the point where his friends see him traveling down and very dangerous road.Finally, Channing Tatum, man this guy is so awsome.  I mean, he is just cool, just smooth, just... NE Way.  He is experiencing problems with flashbacks and bad dreams, but he is a dedicated soldier and returns to the call of duty.  You get a nice little troubling scene with him in his underwear -he use to be a stripper you know, damn talk about a once in a lifetime opportunity.NE way, this is a really great movie, that I think will make a person respect the soldiers and what they really give up for their country.What messed this movie up for me, is that the chick in this movie (rumor has it) is the reason why Reese and Ryan broke up.

1141944,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0013FSL1Q,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Stop-Loss is not for everyone.  While it may begin as a typical war movie with lots of shootings, bombings, explosions and the whole assortment of things you associate with a war (and done rather realistically might I add) the film soon turns into a much *much* slower-paced drama involving one of the soldiers coming home, spending time with his family and refusing to return to Iraq.  He believes he did his time and watched enough of his friends die that he shouldn't have to return, but it turns out he's being forced (hence the name of the movie- Stop-Loss means the soldier is forced to return to war due to an enlistment contract) so he spends quite a bit of his time (75% of the film) making plans on how he's going to avoid having to go back.For us however, the viewers, he spends most of his time walking around with his friends, girlfriend and family.  Now when I mention this is a slower-paced movie, I seriously mean it- if you're not patient enough, you won't be able to stay focused.  It's *that* slow.  However, it's interesting if you're willing to make an effort to pay attention to the storyline and there's never really anything confusing that takes place.  Perhaps the film is a good 30 minutes overlong, but just be aware of its slower pace and that if you're expecting a violent and exciting war movie, you'll be disappointed.The ending is decent at least.  A surprise.  I think most of us are expecting *that* to happen (without spoiling what it is) but... no.

But precisely, being Spanish, I have some observations to do.The USA is today as powerful as Roman Empire 2000 years ago. I think most people around the World should agree in that. And in fact, Roman Legions fought also in the same land today known as &#8220;Iraq&#8221;, Lybia, Mesopotamia, Judea  or as it were.The big differences are, until 200 years, wars and battles were separated in time by years, months or almost weeks between one to another armed engagement or combat, yes, owing to long foot marches, horses and mules, or unfinishable warship sailing. But today&#8217;s war is a fight of 24 hours over 24. In the past, crucial battles as Trafalgar were fought my military men commanded at last by his respective kings, which knew each enemy king very well.Instead today&#8217;s unstoppable, continuum type of war began with First World War, and with these, many new nervous and physical sequels. Roman legionnaires had no machine guns, rockets or airplanes nor snipers rifles, and rested and sleep between battles. Surely they were very hungry, but there was ever a slight human forced stop between combats.  Yes, also the conscription were compulsory, no voluntary, for example,  in the days of the Nelson Navy, and recruitment was brutal and forced.But the physical and sociological condition of ancient soldiers from big historical military powers was similar to these of the common civilian peasants and common people from his times: they all were poor, accustomed to a hard, short life. Of course, Julius Caesar was rich, but the supreme general ever is an exception.  However, I think in the USA of today, social differences are too much big. In this film the soldiers doesn&#8217;t no seem very favored social or economically, so, I find an order as the &#8220;Stop Loss&#8221; is badly received to go back to a war poorly understood with high possibilities of ending killed or seriously wounded, physical and mentally.A good film far of the false, unbelievable heroism of &#8220;Rambo&#8221; and similar movies and technically well achieved.",4,know history of war before judging,1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,2215,"['find', 'delicate', 'review', 'movie', 'foreigner', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'USA', 'order', 'Spot-Loss', 'reason', 'justice', 'precisely', 'being', 'Spanish', 'have', 'observations', 'do.The', 'USA', 'today', 'as', 'powerful', 'Roman', 'Empire', '2000', 'years', 'ago', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'World', 'should', 'agree', 'fact', 'Roman', 'Legions', 'fought', 'also', 'same', 'land', 'today', 'known', '8220', 'Iraq', '8221', 'Lybia', 'Mesopotamia', 'Judea', 'big', 'differences', 'are', '200', 'years', 'wars', 'battles', 'were', 'separated', 'time', 'years', 'months', 'almost', 'weeks', 'one', 'armed', 'engagement', 'combat', 'yes', 'owing', 'long', 'foot', 'marches', 'horses', 'mules', 'unfinishable', 'warship', 'sailing', 'today', '8217', 's', 'war', 'fight', '24', 'hours', '24', 'past', 'crucial', 'battles', 'Trafalgar', 'were', 'fought', 'military', 'men', 'commanded', 'last', 'respective', 'kings', 'knew', 'enemy', 'king', 'very', 'well.Instead', 'today', '8217', 'unstoppable', 'continuum', 'type', 'war', 'began', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'many', 'new', 'nervous', 'physical', 'sequels', 'Roman', 'had', 'machine', 'guns', 'rockets', 'airplanes', 'snipers', 'rifles', 'rested', 'sleep', 'battles', 'Surely', 'were', 'very', 'hungry', 'was', 'ever', 'slight', 'human', 'forced', 'stop', 'combats', 'Yes', 'also', 'conscription', 'were', 'compulsory', 'voluntary', 'example', 'days', 'Nelson', 'Navy', 'recruitment', 'was', 'brutal', 'physical', 'sociological', 'condition', 'ancient', 'soldiers', 'big', 'historical', 'military', 'powers', 'was', 'similar', 'common', 'civilian', 'peasants', 'common', 'people', 'times', 'were', 'poor', 'accustomed', 'hard', 'short', 'life', 'course', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'was', 'rich', 'supreme', 'general', 'ever', 'exception', 'However', 'think', 'USA', 'today', 'social', 'differences', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'big', 'film', 'soldiers', 'doesn', '8217', 'seem', 'very', 'favored', 'social', 'economically', 'find', 'order', '8220', 'Stop', 'Loss', '8221', 'badly', 'received', 'go', 'back', 'war', 'poorly', 'understood', 'high', 'possibilities', 'ending', 'killed', 'seriously', 'wounded', 'physical', 'mentally.A', 'good', 'film', 'far', 'false', 'unbelievable', 'heroism', '8220', 'Rambo', '8221', 'similar', 'movies', 'technically', 'well', 'achieved']",Stop-Loss

1141949,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0013FSL1Q,DanD,"[0, 0]","""Stop-Loss"" is one of those films that divides its audience.  Some will look at it and be appalled at its portrayal of our soldiers as people with troubles; others will applaud its attempt (not quite successful, but laudable nonetheless) to humanize our men and women of uniform.  The film is emotional and honest; honesty is often disturbing, and ""Stop-Loss"" (especially with its opening scenes) isn't a film for everyone.Honesty isn't everything, however, and ""Stop-Loss"" does have its problems.  The film deals with cliches; this is, obviously, a Hollywood necessity, but it does suggest that all returning Iraq veterans suffer PTSD, which of course isn't true; smart film-goers will figure this out for themselves, but it is kind of annoying to see an otherwise-solid film bordering on stereotyping.  And also, the second-half of the film isn't quite as gripping as the first; Phillippe is a great actor (and no, I never thought I would say that; but it's true), but the real dynamic of the film comes from the interaction of our four protagonists: returning vets Brandon (Phillippe), Steve (Channing Tatum, surprisingly good for a change), and Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, reliable as always); and Steve's fiancee, Michelle (Abbie Cornish, a wonder).  When Brandon gets stop-lossed (meaning, even though he's finished his tour, they're sending him back), he goes AWOL, taking Michelle with him.  It's here that the film slowly begins to unravel; we care more about the interaction between the four than we do Brandon's individual plight, and the film grows stronger near the end, when the four are (kind of, and don't worry, no spoilers) reunited.There's a message in ""Stop-Loss,"" of course; it is an anti-war film in the vein of great anti-war statements: it isn't in-your-face.  Subtlety is the name of the game here, and director Kimberly Pierce more or less pulls that off (except towards the end).  But the film, ultimately, doesn't really go anywhere; it doesn't get as deep as we want it to.

1141954,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0013FSL1Q,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","STOP-LOSS (Dir. Kimberly Pierce, 112 minutes) deals with the travails of heroic war vets out of the Iraq War who got hornswaggled into returning to the theater - by a sneaky Bush policy known as ""Stop-Loss"". This meant anyone who was out could be called back to duty - back to war - with little notice. And no, this was not an ""arbitrary"" process. President baby Bush and Company got the most, I'd say the ultimate, out of every soldier.The ones being called back quickly flew into the streaming underground that was getting the vets out of the U.S. into Canada, I believe it was; this film tells that story and in addition, it tells of the brave vets who had no problem returning to war when they were supposed to be home.The beautiful Ryan Phillippe plays Army Special Forces Sgt. Brandon King, an honorable example our fighting best. He's about to get discharged and he cannot wait to get back into life at home in Brazos, Texas. Somehow getting on the wrong side of his commander, he's chosen for ""stop-loss"".As we know, ""stop-loss"" was then-Pres. Bush's backdoor draft to stop our soldier losses. Bush would simply shanghai discharged soldiers right back to the front. So this film is the story of one soldier's defiant attitude toward the war, its ultimate meaning and why it should never have occurred. The intimacy and beauty of the shots - especially the home-video-type close-up work - will make you feel keenly the same horror and loss felt by the soldiers.Ryan acquitted himself well here. I think he's one of our shining stars of the future and is totally underappreciated right now. Kimberly Pierce directed; she was deeply involved in both film versions ofBoys Don't CryandBoys Don't Cry(1995 and 1999) which she also directed. Perhaps that explains the sergeant's interesting name?Here Pierce shows an astonishing sensitivity, empathy and understanding of the entire war experience, though her taste for hyperbolic emotional scenes at times reminded me of the high school acting classes I used to mock on my way to the weight room. In other words, a bit clich&eacute;d.The thoughtful delicacy of Ryan Phillippe is told best in his own words about this film: ""We were there [on location in Morocco] in full [military] gear, with these assault rifles, on what's akin to their Christmas. We were barging into peoples' actual homes to shoot those scenes. I felt incredibly uncomfortable and ashamed at the time.""It's easy to understand how this film got buried in some sort of weird shuffle back in the year '08. Back then, only two years ago, even I did not know what the hell was going on with the Iraqi War or our soldiers coming home. This film will answer those queries for you richly and sometimes horribly. Then you too will be demanding that George W. Bush explain himself. This film is based on true stories.At home, the wife and I promised ourselves we'd never see ANY Iraq or Afghanistan movie, EVER. I finally violated that to my chagrin with the unworthy IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH (another heartbreaking true story, see my review). For that reason alone I decided to risk seeing STOP-LOSS. I was not sorry for a moment (except about the truths I learned from this movie).The ending will shock and awe you. I won't give it away in case you haven't seen this revelatory film yet. All I can say is I was deeply depressed and disgusted by the film's unforeseen ending. You will be too: guaranteed.All the great talent here must go unmentioned, because I haven't the time or space. One query I have is the wasted talent of Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, who plays Sgt. King's father. He gets a few minutes of broken up screen time and a couple of speaking lines. He is a talented, major star and busy at home (he's Irish and works in Britain mostly); why does he make this cameo here? I was angry throughout the whole film that he didn't have a meatier role. And he does a darned good Texan accent too.Also, Pierce gave us an example in each character of typical soldiers: there is the career guy, the loser who cannot cope outside the theater, the maimed little cute mascot, and others. All there to make the viewer weep.Naturally this poor neglected gem had fierce competition in 2008: DOUBT, FROST/NIXON, GRAN TORINO (see my reviews for all), INDIANA JONES AND HIS LOSER FRIENDS, IRON MAN, TWILIGHT (see my reviews), and WALL-E. Tough competition for a film that should have been the winner of the year.Get this film and learn all about the hypocrisy, corruption and just plain low-down war tactics with regards to Iraq and Afghanistan. Then you may be at least a tad more prepared the next time you talk about this evil terror and what it will mean for generations to come.",5,"The horrors of war, George W.

1141955,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B0013FSL1Q,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[4, 9]","""Stop-loss"" is a term coined by the government for a particularly cruel practice, namely the arbitrary rescinding of a soldier's exit from the war theater. Supposedly only employable in times of war, it has been used during the Iraq-Afghani conflict to maintain strong numbers of troops in high-risk areas. The soldier, apparently, has no warning of the fact that he is stop-lossed until processing his papers to get out and go home. This, at least, is what happens to the protagonist in this movie.The film does not dwell on the battles in Iraq, although it begins there, introducing us to a bunch of good-old-boy young men from the same small town in Texas, who have been together for a long time in Iraq and are used to thinking as a unit and looking out for each other. It shows them during the excruciating boredom of down-time, and then leads us through a terrible encounter in the crowded, narrow streets of a town in Iraq, skirmishing with snipers and terrorists, and leaves nothing to the imagination about the cruelties of war.Shortly thereafter, it shows the boys coming home, for what they think is for good. Ryan Phillippe, in a strong performance as the sergeant of the unit, is broadsided by the news that he is being almost immediately shipped back to Iraq, and he understandably protests vehemently. His superior, considering him a flight risk by his demeanour, orders him escorted to the stockade, and in a chance moment of opportunity while being marched to transport, he disables his guards and escapes.His plan after his escape is to take the unfairness and seeming illegality of his enforced reenlistment straight to some politician who can effect change, but one feels from the start that it is a bit like the mouse that roared; government is government, and is impervious to chiding from a nonentity like an inconvenienced soldier. His efforts are altruistic; he is not trying to bring justice just for himself, but for all the soldiers who come home expecting to get married, take a job as a car salesman, and try to forget the horrors of war. It's plain, however, that he is up against an immovable force.There have been some strong, well-acted, and well-presented films of late on the Iraq conflict and/or its effect on the young people who go there believing, no doubt, that they can make a difference. Certainly some difference is made, but the toll it takes on the psyches of those in conflict is dire and sad. I grew up during the Viet Nam War, and do not profess to know the extent of damage that conflict made on those involved - heavy, I know - but war is war, and no one involved emerges unscathed, I am sure. It is made clear in Stop-Loss that idealism is quickly stripped away, and despair becomes endemic.Strongly acted by all participants, and Ryan Phillippe in particular deserves kudos.",4,Uncle Sam's welcome home,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,2827,"['Stop-loss', 'term', 'coined', 'government', 'particularly', 'cruel', 'practice', 'namely', 'arbitrary', 'rescinding', 'soldier', 'exit', 'war', 'theater', 'Supposedly', 'only', 'employable', 'times', 'war', 'been', 'used', 'Iraq-Afghani', 'conflict', 'maintain', 'strong', 'numbers', 'troops', 'high-risk', 'areas', 'soldier', 'apparently', 'warning', 'fact', 'stop-lossed', 'processing', 'papers', 'get', 'out', 'go', 'home', 'least', 'what', 'protagonist', 'movie.The', 'film', 'not', 'dwell', 'battles', 'Iraq', 'there', 'introducing', 'bunch', 'good-old-boy', 'young', 'men', 'same', 'small', 'town', 'Texas', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'together', 'long', 'time', 'Iraq', 'are', 'used', 'thinking', 'unit', 'looking', 'out', 'other', 'excruciating', 'boredom', 'down-time', 'then', 'terrible', 'encounter', 'crowded', 'narrow', 'streets', 'town', 'Iraq', 'skirmishing', 'snipers', 'terrorists', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'cruelties', 'war.Shortly', 'thereafter', 'boys', 'coming', 'home', 'what', 'think', 'good', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'strong', 'performance', 'sergeant', 'unit', 'broadsided', 'news', 'being', 'almost', 'immediately', 'shipped', 'back', 'Iraq', 'understandably', 'vehemently', 'superior', 'considering', 'flight', 'risk', 'demeanour', 'orders', 'escorted', 'stockade', 'chance', 'moment', 'opportunity', 'being', 'marched', 'transport', 'guards', 'escapes.His', 'plan', 'escape', 'take', 'unfairness', 'seeming', 'illegality', 'enforced', 'reenlistment', 'straight', 'politician', 'who', 'can', 'effect', 'change', 'one', 'feels', 'start', 'bit', 'mouse', 'roared', 'government', 'government', 'impervious', 'chiding', 'nonentity', 'inconvenienced', 'soldier', 'efforts', 'are', 'altruistic', 'not', 'trying', 'bring', 'justice', 'just', 'soldiers', 'who', 'come', 'home', 'expecting', 'get', 'married', 'take', 'job', 'car', 'salesman', 'try', 'forget', 'horrors', 'war', 'plain', 'however', 'up', 'immovable', 'force.There', 'have', 'been', 'strong', 'well-acted', 'well-presented', 'films', 'late', 'Iraq', 'conflict', 'and/or', 'effect', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'there', 'believing', 'doubt', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'Certainly', 'difference', 'made', 'toll', 'psyches', 'conflict', 'dire', 'sad', 'grew', 'up', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'War', 'do', 'not', 'profess', 'know', 'extent', 'damage', 'conflict', 'made', 'involved', 'heavy', 'know', 'war', 'war', 'one', 'involved', 'unscathed', 'am', 'sure', 'made', 'clear', 'Stop-Loss', 'idealism', 'quickly', 'stripped', 'away', 'despair', 'becomes', 'endemic.Strongly', 'acted', 'participants', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'particular', 'deserves', 'kudos']",Stop-Loss
1141956,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0013FSL1Q,Grady Harp,"[7, 12]","The title of this film STOP-LOSS may puzzle many.  According to Wikipedia, 'Stop-loss, in the United States military, is the involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service (ETS) date. It also applies to the cessation of a permanent change of station (PCS) move for a member still in military service'.  According to writer (with Mark Richard)/director Kimberly Pierce (whose previous 'Boy's Don't Cry' tackled similarly volatile issues), the impetus for making this film about the effects of war on veterans returning home was her viewing of videos taken by soldiers while actively engaged in battle in Iraq: this is the first war where the soldiers have actually photographed their own experiences, documenting the realities/horrors of war on the now popular video equipment at their disposal.  It is a solid idea for a film, but somehow the idea gets diluted in the script.Texas homeboys who have just returned from the Iraq war are greeted with a parade and medals and empty rhetoric, but find adapting to reentry into their native land is fraught with the deeply embedded mental wounds of their experience: interpersonal relationships fall apart, families face altered personalities in their sons, Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome reigns.  Brandon (Ryan Phillippe) blames himself for the deaths of his men, Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) drinks himself toward suicide, Rico (Victor Rasuk) attempts to see past his traumatically missing limbs, Isaac (Rob Brown) finds his entire world out of focus, and Steve (Channing Tatum) sees the military as his only point of reality to a life of success.  When Brandon receives his Stop-Loss instead of his discharge papers his world turns upside down and he flounders in his nightmares and his need for escape to Canada or Mexico with his friend Michelle (Abbie Cornish).  The horror of events that follow the homecoming of these damaged soldiers culminates in a tragedy that somehow results in the soldiers following the orders of the governmental Stop-Loss orders.  And that is the worst tragedy.Though the message is important, the delivery of it gets hazy: the motivations of the characters are too loosely defined to convince us of their terrible plights.  But the impact on the public should be a wake-up call on the extended damage of war - any war- on the men and women who experience it first hand and carry the mental scars for life.  For that reason, if for no other, this is a film that should be seen.

1141959,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,B0013FSL1Q,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[2, 3]","Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Victor Rasuk & Abbie Cornish....Some of the hottest and most promising of modern-day Hollywood's young actors.About 15 minutes into this movie, I was very much enthralled by it's storyline and acting.It's a pretty good chronicle of what today's young service men & women go through in theongoing Iraq conflict. Basically, after coming home to the states again, after serving admirablyin many military missions, Ryan Phillippe's character, all set to ETS, finds himself in a fixwith the very military he's served so well. They have a quite shady backdoor re-draft policy known asa STOP-LOSS, where they can re-up soliders who have already fought, and who are about to end theirtour of duty. All of the characters are dealing with their own re-adjustment issues; Channing Tatum'scharacter is prone to fits of violence, and delusions that he is back in Iraq, in the heat of battle.He finds it impossible to maintain any intimate long-lasting relationships, other than withhis war brothers. His girlfriend / fiance', played by Abbie Cornish, feels scared, helpless, and frustratedagainst her boyfriend's plight, and often turns to his best friend----Yes, you got it!---Ryan Phillipe's character,in times strife and confusion. The two form a bond/attraction, which leads to a torn-between-two-loversstress point later in the film. J. Gordon-Levitt's character is struggling with alcoholism.He tries religion, but needs something more substantial than that. Sadly, solace doesn't come for him.Victor Rasuk's character gets severely injured early on in the film, and does a very good jobplaying a solider of latino descent, who is rendered helpless in the prime of his life.To tell the truth, after awhile, Phillippe's character, (usually the pillar of strength for all his buddies),becomes a bit ragged around the mental edges too, as he is basically rendered a fugutive / AWOL from military duty...A situation he doesn't deserve to be in. But in a STOP-LOSS situation, this is often the case.Without giving the movie away further, the film takes some interesting turns, and all the actors did anexcellent job in the portrayal of their roles. Like the movie, ""The Hurt Locker"", which was an Iraq-eratype of film too, but from a different perspective, ""Stop-Loss"" was directed by a female director...Kimberly Pierce, who did a stellar job in that capacity.Though I loved Jeremy Renner's character in ""Hurt Locker"", I didn't find the directing as tight andrefined, nor the storyline as clear and easy to follow as with ""Stop-Loss"".To me, ""Stop-Loss"" should have been the film getting all the accolades and awards.I must add that the themes of friendship, loyalty, loss, betrayal, duty, etc. run throughout as well.To me, a female director always seems to interweave more emotional depth in a film.Not that male directors can't or don't...but the women directors really excel in that area.It's already established that Ryan Phillipe is a very good actor, but Channing Tatum should notbe slept on either!---More and more, with each role, he is proving himself to be a very credible actor.I give this movie **5 Stars**  A Very Good Film.",5,"Enjoyed This 10x Better Than I Did ""The Hurt Locker""...Which Got Way More Accolades!!",1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,3180,"['Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', '.Some', 'hottest', 'most', 'promising', 'modern-day', 'Hollywood', 'young', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'enthralled', 'storyline', 'acting.It', 'pretty', 'good', 'chronicle', 'what', 'today', 'young', 'service', 'men', 'women', 'go', 'theongoing', 'Iraq', 'conflict', 'Basically', 'coming', 'home', 'states', 'again', 'serving', 'admirablyin', 'many', 'military', 'missions', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'character', 'set', 'ETS', 'fixwith', 'very', 'military', 'served', 'so', 'well', 'have', 'quite', 'shady', 'backdoor', 're-draft', 'policy', 'known', 'asa', 'STOP-LOSS', 'where', 'can', 're-up', 'soliders', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'fought', 'who', 'are', 'end', 'theirtour', 'duty', 'characters', 'are', 'dealing', 'own', 're-adjustment', 'issues', 'Channing', ""Tatum'scharacter"", 'prone', 'fits', 'violence', 'delusions', 'back', 'Iraq', 'heat', 'battle.He', 'impossible', 'maintain', 'intimate', 'long-lasting', 'relationships', 'other', 'withhis', 'war', 'brothers', 'girlfriend', '/', 'fiance', 'played', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'feels', 'scared', 'helpless', 'boyfriend', 'plight', 'often', 'best', 'friend', 'Yes', 'got', '-Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'character', 'times', 'strife', 'confusion', 'two', 'form', 'bond/attraction', 'torn-between-two-loversstress', 'point', 'later', 'film', 'J.', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'character', 'struggling', 'alcoholism.He', 'tries', 'religion', 'something', 'more', 'substantial', 'Sadly', 'solace', ""n't"", 'come', 'him.Victor', 'Rasuk', 'character', 'severely', 'injured', 'early', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'jobplaying', 'solider', 'latino', 'descent', 'who', 'rendered', 'helpless', 'prime', 'life.To', 'tell', 'truth', 'awhile', 'Phillippe', 'character', 'usually', 'pillar', 'strength', 'buddies', 'bit', 'ragged', 'mental', 'edges', 'too', 'basically', 'rendered', 'fugutive', '/', 'AWOL', 'military', 'duty', 'situation', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'STOP-LOSS', 'situation', 'often', 'case.Without', 'giving', 'movie', 'away', 'further', 'film', 'interesting', 'turns', 'actors', 'did', 'anexcellent', 'job', 'portrayal', 'roles', 'movie', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'was', 'Iraq-eratype', 'film', 'too', 'different', 'perspective', 'Stop-Loss', 'was', 'directed', 'female', 'director', 'Kimberly', 'Pierce', 'who', 'did', 'stellar', 'job', 'capacity.Though', 'loved', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'character', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'directing', 'tight', 'andrefined', 'storyline', 'clear', 'easy', 'follow', 'Stop-Loss', 'Stop-Loss', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'getting', 'accolades', 'awards.I', 'must', 'add', 'themes', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'loss', 'betrayal', 'duty', 'etc', 'run', 'well.To', 'female', 'director', 'always', 'interweave', 'more', 'emotional', 'depth', 'film.Not', 'male', 'directors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'women', 'directors', 'really', 'excel', 'area.It', 'already', 'established', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'should', 'notbe', 'slept', '-More', 'more', 'role', 'proving', 'be', 'very', 'credible', 'actor.I', 'give', 'movie', 'Stars**', 'A', 'Very', 'Good', 'Film']",Stop-Loss
1141960,A9I40WFF40R4,B0013FSL1Q,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[11, 18]","Kimberly Pierce's last movie was ""Boys Don't Cry,"" starring Hilary Swank who gave a critically acclaimed performance. Now eight years later Pierce directs ""Stop-Loss, the term used to describe the military's sending soldiers back to battle when they have just finished one combat tour of duty. I am not sure what I was expecting but I got more than I bargained for as apparently did the other members of the audience from both my and their reactions. They ranged from audible sobs that began almost immediately after the film began, to groans to one man's comment sitting near me of ""damn this country."" Although I have never seen ""Saving Private Ryan"" but know of the first 20 minutes or so of the violent depiction of battle in that film, I cannot fathom, however, that it is rawer and bloodier than the first few minutes of ""Stop-Loss."" The violence and bloodshed are relentless, and the battle scenes are shot as if they were done by an amateur with a hand-held video camera.The acting is impeccable; the cinematography --by Chris Menges-- is extraordinary. The film essentially belongs to Ryan Phillipe who plays Sgt. Brandon King-- although there are no bad performances--, recently having returned to his hometown in Texas after completing a tour of duty in Iraq where he lost several of his men. On the day that he is to have been discharged, he learns that he has been reassigned to Iraq. Rather than return to combat, he goes AWOL and does a cross-country drive to Washington with his friend Michelle played by Abbie Cornish in another first-class performance. They in their naivete initially believe that their senator will be able to help them.I am not sure what the director wanted to achieve. Supposedly she made the movie out of anger over her brother's experience as a soldier in Iraq. If she wanted to show the horror of war, she more than accomplished her mission. The violence and the heartwrenching fate of the soldiers, both in and after combat, begin in the first frames of the film and never abate. The nadir of this movie-- although several events come close-- occurs when King, on his way to D. C., visits his forever-maimed buddy in a hospital. The soldier's optimism-- is he whistling in the dark-- in such overwhelming adversity-- will tear your heart out.Upon leaving the theatre, I wondered if this film would have any effect on anyone. The hawks and doves probably will not change their positions on the Iraq War. On the other hand, conventional wisdom says that sometimes art does make a difference. The novel UNCLE TOM'S CABIN we are told influenced how people felt about slavery. And recently much was made by the media as to whether ""Saturday Night Live's depiction of Hillary Clinton's unfair treatment by the media with a capital ""M"" would in any way have an impact on voters.If nothing else, this film stands for the proposition that indeed boys-- even grown men-- do cry, as evidenced both by the men in ""Stop-Loss"" and the men in the audience.",4,Boys Do Cry,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,2983,"['Kimberly', 'Pierce', 'last', 'movie', 'was', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'starring', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'who', 'gave', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'performance', 'Now', 'eight', 'years', 'later', 'Pierce', 'Stop-Loss', 'term', 'used', 'describe', 'military', 'sending', 'soldiers', 'back', 'battle', 'when', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'one', 'combat', 'tour', 'duty', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'got', 'more', 'bargained', 'apparently', 'did', 'other', 'members', 'audience', 'reactions', 'ranged', 'audible', 'sobs', 'began', 'almost', 'immediately', 'film', 'began', 'groans', 'one', 'man', 'comment', 'sitting', 'damn', 'country', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'know', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'violent', 'depiction', 'battle', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'however', 'rawer', 'bloodier', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Stop-Loss', 'violence', 'bloodshed', 'are', 'relentless', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'were', 'done', 'amateur', 'hand-held', 'video', 'camera.The', 'acting', 'impeccable', 'cinematography', 'Chris', 'Menges', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'essentially', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'who', 'Sgt', 'Brandon', 'King', 'are', 'bad', 'performances', 'recently', 'having', 'returned', 'hometown', 'Texas', 'completing', 'tour', 'duty', 'Iraq', 'where', 'lost', 'several', 'men', 'day', 'have', 'been', 'discharged', 'been', 'reassigned', 'Iraq', 'Rather', 'return', 'combat', 'AWOL', 'cross-country', 'drive', 'Washington', 'friend', 'Michelle', 'played', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'first-class', 'performance', 'naivete', 'initially', 'believe', 'senator', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'them.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'director', 'wanted', 'achieve', 'Supposedly', 'made', 'movie', 'anger', 'brother', 'experience', 'soldier', 'Iraq', 'wanted', 'show', 'horror', 'war', 'more', 'accomplished', 'mission', 'violence', 'heartwrenching', 'fate', 'soldiers', 'combat', 'begin', 'first', 'frames', 'film', 'never', 'abate', 'nadir', 'movie', 'several', 'events', 'come', 'close', 'when', 'King', 'way', 'D.', 'C.', 'forever-maimed', 'buddy', 'hospital', 'soldier', 'optimism', 'whistling', 'dark', 'such', 'overwhelming', 'adversity', 'will', 'tear', 'heart', 'leaving', 'theatre', 'wondered', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'effect', 'anyone', 'hawks', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'change', 'positions', 'Iraq', 'War', 'other', 'hand', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'sometimes', 'art', 'make', 'difference', 'novel', 'UNCLE', 'TOM', 'CABIN', 'are', 'told', 'influenced', 'how', 'people', 'felt', 'slavery', 'recently', 'much', 'was', 'made', 'media', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'depiction', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'unfair', 'treatment', 'media', 'capital', 'M', 'would', 'way', 'have', 'impact', 'voters.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'film', 'proposition', 'indeed', 'even', 'grown', 'men', 'do', 'cry', 'evidenced', 'men', 'Stop-Loss', 'men', 'audience']",Stop-Loss

How to cope with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? The film shows several examples. When astronauts are returned home, they are decompressed concerning their experiences. When prisoners of war are returned home, they, too, are decompressed, but soldiers from battle on leave? In this film, their commander advises them ""not to have sex with anyone underage or hit their wives or children.""This is the story of Team Leader Brandon King (strongly played by Ryan Phillipe), a native of Brazos, Texas, who shortly after a failed firefight and unnecessary loss of men, returns home on leave, along with the other men in his company, to see several of his men become unglued.When he tries to ""out-process"" himself and his military gear from active duty, he learns at the 24th hour that he has been Stop-Lossed, or his active duty time involuntarily extended for another tour of duty in Iraq. Why? Because men like him (with experience) are needed in a non-draft military. In contested cases the Army always wins because of contract loopholes in time of war. In other words, a ""back-draft"" is activated, placing experienced veterans ""back"" in a war environment.The second half of the movie concerns King's reaction and actions toward what he finds as a grossly unfair Stop-Loss command. The path he takes or doesn't take is not so much the question as the question is: How fair is it for the government to assume control of a soldier about to be released from active duty, then use him for its own needs, and, as officials deem it, a necessity in time of war.King sees a major option open to him: Go to Washington to see his local, supportive senator to find a way out of his situation. Other options: Leave the country as a deserter with new identity, knowing he can never go home again, or return to the service and Iraq and clear his name.The paths King takes and choices he makes are heartbreaking and devastating. But I also found Stop-Loss morally reprehensible as military action that is both legal and binding without consideration for the individual soldier. In time of war the military has the presumptive right over the individual, but this is a war that President Bush legally declared ended.In the final analysis, in a Stop-Loss action, the soldier must relinquish his individual rights, whether through desertion or in submission to duty. ""Stop-Loss"" becomes almost a documentary of Sgt.

Ryan Phillipe has always found peace at the ranch, it's been a safe place, but now it's become a place of danger now that he is AWOL or whatever.  This ranch place is a couple of shacks hardly fit for dogs to live in, but the imaginary Texas boys of Peirce's screenplay slobber all over it like lt's the Grand Hilton of boy fun.  They shoot off dozens of rifles and handguns and kill them some wild animals.  I get it, it's sort of like Iraq, but it made me start thinking, maybe Iraq would be more fun for these boys if they could do the kind of uninhibited drinking they do out at their forty acre ranch.  Australian starlet Abbie Cornish seems to have prepared for her part as the girl next door by watching reel after reel of old LBJ press conferences, and her West Texas accent is startlingly good, if a little, well, brusque.  Any moment I expected her to pick up a beagle by its ears and swing it around.You know what it's like, the hunting sequences in Vincente Minnelli's HOME FROM THE HILL.  I expect Minnelli had even less experience that Peirce being out on a weeklong fox hunt with a pack of drink-crazed good ol boys, but he brought an imagined, Bacchic frenzy to such sequences, amped up the red filter playing off the barbeque flames, and it paid off for him.  In each case, the director's fascination with masculinity makes film fairly pop with color and sweat.  Minnelli probably wished from his grave, that it had been he who had captured that shot of a drunken Channing Tatum, wearing only a pair of insanely tight, sultry and shiny Calvin Kleins, digging himself into a makeshift grave in his own front garden, cowering in the headlights of a car, crying and turning his own body into a Pieta.",4,Minnelli Rebooted,1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,1966,"['STOP', 'LOSS', 'film', 'many', 'virtues', 'especially', 'raw', 'rushed', 'look', 'great', 'Chris', 'Menges', ""n't"", 'much', 'screenplay', 'boys-only', 'sequences', 'leave', 'audiences', 'wondering', 'how', 'Kim', 'Peirce', 'men', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'always', 'found', 'peace', 'ranch', 'been', 'safe', 'place', 'now', 'become', 'place', 'danger', 'now', 'AWOL', 'ranch', 'place', 'couple', 'shacks', 'hardly', 'fit', 'dogs', 'live', 'imaginary', 'Texas', 'boys', 'Peirce', 'screenplay', 'slobber', 'lt', 'Grand', 'Hilton', 'boy', 'fun', 'shoot', 'dozens', 'rifles', 'handguns', 'kill', 'wild', 'animals', 'get', 'sort', 'Iraq', 'made', 'start', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'Iraq', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'fun', 'boys', 'could', 'do', 'kind', 'uninhibited', 'drinking', 'do', 'out', 'forty', 'acre', 'ranch', 'Australian', 'starlet', 'Abbie', 'Cornish', 'have', 'prepared', 'part', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'watching', 'reel', 'reel', 'old', 'LBJ', 'press', 'conferences', 'West', 'Texas', 'accent', 'startlingly', 'good', 'little', 'well', 'brusque', 'moment', 'expected', 'pick', 'up', 'beagle', 'ears', 'swing', 'around.You', 'know', 'what', 'hunting', 'sequences', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'HOME', 'THE', 'HILL', 'expect', 'Minnelli', 'had', 'even', 'less', 'experience', 'Peirce', 'being', 'out', 'weeklong', 'fox', 'hunt', 'pack', 'drink-crazed', 'good', 'ol', 'boys', 'brought', 'imagined', 'Bacchic', 'frenzy', 'such', 'sequences', 'amped', 'up', 'red', 'filter', 'playing', 'off', 'barbeque', 'flames', 'paid', 'off', 'case', 'director', 'fascination', 'masculinity', 'film', 'fairly', 'pop', 'color', 'sweat', 'Minnelli', 'probably', 'wished', 'grave', 'had', 'been', 'who', 'had', 'captured', 'shot', 'drunken', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'wearing', 'only', 'pair', 'insanely', 'tight', 'sultry', 'shiny', 'Calvin', 'Kleins', 'digging', 'makeshift', 'grave', 'own', 'front', 'garden', 'cowering', 'headlights', 'car', 'crying', 'turning', 'own', 'body', 'Pieta']",Stop-Loss

Three of the soldiers go back home to Texas and are welcomed with open arms.  The soldiers are played well by Ryan Phillippe, Joseph Gordon Lewitt and Channing Tatum.  Ryan Phillippe who generally doesn't tend to show all that much range in his films does so in this.  He's pretty convincing and if you're not paying attention you may not recognize him he's that absolved in the character.  He discovers after being home for a very short time that he's been stop-lossed and has to be shipped back to Iraq.  He goes AWOL and on the run.  The rest of the details I'll leave up to you to see as it is worth seeing.  It's probably not as accurate, realistic or as great as ""The Hurt Locker"", but it is good.  It's got a lot of thrown in drama.  All three of the guys seem to be experiencing severe post traumatic stress disorders from the war.  I imagine it probably does haunt many soldiers and those that see a lot of deaths, but ironic that it's all three soldiers. I guess it's all part of the movie magic.  This is a little bit of fiction and a little of bit of truth, you decide which.  This isn't another film about the Iraq War, but more a film about the ""Stop-loss policy"" which many don't know much about and should.  Many soliders are involuntarily forced to go back and serve in the war when they don't want to.  I'm sure there are those who disagree with it and find this to be inaccurate.

Ryan Philippe has been in a number of films that I like such asCrash (Widescreen Edition),Flags of Our Fathers (Widescreen Edition),Chaos&Breach (Widescreen Edition).  As Sgt. Brandon King, he is the squad leader who looks forward to concluding his military service after experiencing the death of his fellow soldiers.The homecoming sequences speak of soldiers who have suffered Post Traumatic Stress and the confusion of their families who do not quite know how to deal with wounded spirits, minds and bodies.  Channing Tatum fromShe's the Man (Widescreen Edition)&Supercrossdoes an excellent job as the confused soldier.  The scene where he digs a trench in his front yard and totes a gun around is scary.  Australian actress Abbie Cornish who was inElizabeth - The Golden Age (Widescreen Edition)does a credible job with the American accent as the girl who befriends Brandon and dumps Steve when he reenlists.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt who is familiar from TV's ""Third Rock from the Sun"" plays Tommy Burges who gets so crazy that he gets booted out of the service even though he wants to stay in.  Timothy Olyphant who was great as the lead inHitman (Unrated Edition)plays Lt. Col. Boot Miller and talks the company line to his soldiers.  His decision to throw Brandon King into the brig ignites King's escape and sets up the last two-thirds of the film.  Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer plays Tommy's wife and does well graveside.  Gummer did an excellent job inEveningand shines in this small role.  Linda Emond who was inAcross the Universe (Two-Disc Special Edition)& North Country (Widescreen Edition) is very sympathetic and loyal to her son Brandon as his mother Ida King.  Veteran actor Ciaran Hinds plays Brandon's father Roy.  Victor Rasuk has an outstanding cameo as the injured Rico Rodriguez who loses an arm, a leg and his vision.Yes, there are politics about the war that the film addresses.  The film reflects that war is an awful experience.  Our fighting men and women are put into hellish circumstances that no father nor mother would wish on their children, but which world events prove necessary.  In a democracy such as ours, the people can change course or stay the course on Election Day.  I don't think you can fault the President for doing what he feels is appropriate or the soldiers who fight the war.  The ultimate responsibility is with the American people.  Ultimately this conflict is their choice IMHO.  However, ""Stop-Loss"" is not politics.  It deals in an artful manner with the consequences of war.  It does it honestly, even-handedly & with some excellent acting talent.  The DVD extra deleted scenes were interesting to watch.  The ending did not seem to fit the rest of the film, however.  It was as if the screenwirter or producer insisted that the film shift gears rather than letting the film conclude in a natural organic way.

They also did not include enough ""bonding"" time to introduce the soldiers they were going to track with the audience so you would care more deeply about their predicament.  They should have patterned it after ""The Boys in Company C"" but ended up producing a story that stumbled along uncertainly from one character crisis to the next.

1141973,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0013FSL1Q,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 5]","Stop-Loss is a rather intense film that focuses on the military's ""stop-loss"" program--a practice that allows the military to re-deploy American troops back to combat duty in places like Iraq even when they have completely fulfilled their obligations by doing their complete tour of duty. The film's plot moves along well although a few minutes could have edited out to make the story a bit more gripping. The acting is extremely convincing; the choreography and cinematography enhance the movie quite a bit. The casting was excellent and the script well written, too. I should also mention that I really appreciate the input from soldiers and their families; because of them I know so much more about ""stop-loss"" than I otherwise would have if I had just watched this film. It's important to note that the filmmaker is neither truly anti-soldier nor cheering for a man who has gone AWOL, Kimberly Peirce is protesting the ""stop-loss"" program; and if you watch the movie from this perspective I think you will like it more.When the action starts, we meet decorated Staff Sergeant Brian King (Ryan Phillippe) and some of his very good buddies including Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Sergeant Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) returning home from combat duty in Iraq. To one degree or another, they are all upset about the trauma they experienced during combat, seeing some of their best friends die and others like Private Rico Rodriguez (Victor Rasuk) terribly maimed for life, losing his sight and more than one limb. However, Brian is relieved and at least somewhat optimistic about his future because he's ""gettin' out;"" he wants to adjust to life as a civilian in his native Texas again--until, that is, he finds out from a bureaucratic cog in a wheel that he is being unexpectedly ""stop-lossed:"" he must now return to Iraq and serve even more time.  While his buddy Steve doesn't see a problem with this (Steve has been sent back, too), Brian is very disgruntled; and his brief and unproductive meeting with Lieutenant Colonel Boot Miller (Timothy Olyphant) makes him so angry that Brian breaks free from the hold of two men, steals a jeep and flees the military base.Of course, this makes for quite a crisis. Steve is very opposed to what Brian has done; not only has Brian stolen Steve's jeep, Steve honestly believes that they must serve in the military until they are no longer wanted for any purpose at all. This creates plenty of tension between Steve and Brian; and there's more tension, too, between Steve and his girlfriend Michelle (Abbie Cornish). Michelle wants to marry Steve; she's tired of him telling her it'll only be ""one more year"" before he leaves the military and they can get married. Things gets even more intense when Brian's parents Roy and Ida (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Linda Emond) are determined to protect Brian; the last thing they want is for their son to risk his life all over again in combat for many months or even longer.I could tell you so much more; but that would start to spoil it for you. Believe it or not, there's plenty more to the plot--I certainly haven't given it all away! Suffice it to say that Michelle tries to help Brian escape to safe ground while he's AWOL and not yet caught by police and military brass who are looking for Brian in just about every nook and cranny.Stop-Loss is not a film for small children; there's a fair amount of violence and the filmmakers pull no punches when it comes to portraying the horrible effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

1141977,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B0013FSL1Q,PJR,"[2, 6]","How decent, brave, fairly naive kids get taken advantage of, is what this film invites us to think about. It is more a film about the psychological casualties of war stateside than about battle in Iraq. There is just enough battle to show why kids might have bad dreams and family problems when they get home, and so those scenes were necessarily condensed.This may be somewhat unrealistic, and certainly not representative for all soldiers, much as Jarhead may be not representative of everyone with regard to the boredom side of being in the military.I do think absolutely that we should honor men and women who enlist with their eyes wide open. But many kids tend to have their eyes wide shut and the system too often takes advantage of this. This has been explored in many films. Gallipoli is one of my favorites. In Stop Loss as in the Australian film Gallipoli the kids were rather simple boys. Stop Loss deals with more or less beer-drinking small-town rural kids who are basically robust and any disillusionment does not come to the surface on the battlefield, although they are getting some kind of wake-up but they are tough and adaptable and it stays within.The serious psychological conflicts erupt when they get back home for awhile. I think that the acting here of conflicted youth and the different individual ways of handling it (or not) is really great and the best feature of the film. Statistically sure not every soldier experiences post traumatic stress and/or family problems - but the point is that when it does happen, and it surely does! -- it can take many forms from subtle to quite overt.It is easier to remember the dead than the damaged. I find it offensive that we honor the dead as heroes and too often treat the psychologically damaged as though they are not full human beings but rather ""weak,"" or ""cowards,"" or ""misfits."" In this particular war we even seem to try to keep the physically damaged soldiers out of the public mind, and bring the dead back quietly to keep the coffins away from the media.Maybe this is the price of an all volunteer army, to keep the unpleasant stuff out of sight so that those kids who are naive will enlist with their eyes wide shut. Stop Loss offers kids an opportunity to think through some of the unpleasant things of which they may be unaware.But even for an older person like me I think the film was a very well done fictional exploration of some of the home front realities of wars and of the War in Iraq in particular.",5,Wow!,1224720000,"10 23, 2008",2008,2491,"['How', 'decent', 'brave', 'fairly', 'naive', 'kids', 'get', 'taken', 'advantage', 'what', 'film', 'think', 'more', 'film', 'psychological', 'casualties', 'war', 'stateside', 'about', 'battle', 'Iraq', 'just', 'enough', 'battle', 'show', 'why', 'kids', 'might', 'have', 'bad', 'dreams', 'family', 'problems', 'when', 'get', 'home', 'so', 'scenes', 'were', 'necessarily', 'condensed.This', 'may', 'be', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'certainly', 'not', 'representative', 'soldiers', 'much', 'Jarhead', 'may', 'be', 'not', 'representative', 'everyone', 'regard', 'boredom', 'side', 'being', 'military.I', 'do', 'think', 'absolutely', 'should', 'honor', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'enlist', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'many', 'kids', 'tend', 'have', 'eyes', 'wide', 'shut', 'system', 'too', 'often', 'advantage', 'been', 'explored', 'many', 'films', 'Gallipoli', 'one', 'favorites', 'Stop', 'Loss', 'Australian', 'film', 'Gallipoli', 'kids', 'were', 'rather', 'simple', 'boys', 'Stop', 'Loss', 'more', 'less', 'beer-drinking', 'small-town', 'rural', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'basically', 'robust', 'disillusionment', 'not', 'come', 'surface', 'battlefield', 'are', 'getting', 'kind', 'wake-up', 'are', 'tough', 'adaptable', 'within.The', 'serious', 'psychological', 'conflicts', 'erupt', 'when', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'awhile', 'think', 'acting', 'here', 'conflicted', 'youth', 'different', 'individual', 'ways', 'handling', 'not', 'really', 'great', 'best', 'feature', 'film', 'Statistically', 'sure', 'not', 'soldier', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'family', 'problems', 'point', 'when', 'happen', 'surely', 'can', 'take', 'many', 'forms', 'subtle', 'quite', 'overt.It', 'easier', 'remember', 'dead', 'damaged', 'find', 'offensive', 'honor', 'dead', 'heroes', 'too', 'often', 'treat', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'are', 'not', 'full', 'human', 'beings', 'rather', 'weak', 'cowards', 'misfits', 'particular', 'war', 'even', 'seem', 'try', 'keep', 'physically', 'damaged', 'soldiers', 'public', 'mind', 'bring', 'dead', 'back', 'quietly', 'keep', 'coffins', 'away', 'media.Maybe', 'price', 'volunteer', 'army', 'keep', 'unpleasant', 'stuff', 'sight', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'naive', 'will', 'enlist', 'eyes', 'wide', 'shut', 'Stop', 'Loss', 'kids', 'opportunity', 'think', 'unpleasant', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'unaware.But', 'even', 'older', 'person', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'fictional', 'exploration', 'home', 'front', 'realities', 'wars', 'War', 'Iraq', 'particular']",Stop-Loss

1141980,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B0013FSL1Q,Robert Blake,"[1, 3]","Hollywood has been having a hard time capturing the American post-9/11 experience, some films like ""Lions For Lambs"" are muddled political commentaries. Documentaries have done much better capturing the Iraq experience, especially ""Operation Homecoming"" and ""Taxi To The Dark Side."" Kimberly Peirce's ""Stop-Loss"" is one of the best dramatic efforts about Iraq yet produced, it has a lighter heart than the dark ""In The Valley Of Elah"" and makes a better effort at trying to understand the situation of soldiers returning from the front. It captures one particular phenomenon, I doubt Peirce meant this as a commentary on all Iraq war veterans in general, and no film could possibly capture the entire scope of the wartime experience in just an hour and forty-five minutes.""Stop-Loss"" follows a group of small-town Texan soldiers returning from Iraq after brutal urban combat experiences. The film wonderfully captures the atmosphere and people of rural Texas with settings that feel completely authentic. The soldiers themselves are well-written, the screenply by Mark Richard and Kimberly Peirce create a gang of friends we grow to care about. They don't feel like cardboard recycles of previous films but like real young men experiencing traumatic events. Ryan Phillippe is especially convincing in his performance and loses himself in tone, accent and attitude. He's a long way from the kid we first met in films like ""Cruel Intentions"" and ""54.""Peirce manages to create a film that mixes powerful drama with political commentary and visceral action. The scenes in Iraq are sharp and well-done, never evoking the morbid adrenaline of ""Rambo,"" instead she captures the confusion and raw reality of combat. Some will cringe or complain over the sight of Iraqi civilians being killed, but such is the reality of what is happening, those who disagree are welcome to put the film aside. The political angle of the film is well-handled, it is obvious this is an anti-war movie, but it also doesn't feel like a sermon. Peirce lets the characters, events and situations express the politics, it isn't like ""Lions For Lambs,"" which was literally just a discussion put on film. Here a character chooses to run, and the story follows his journey with intensity and emotion. Through simple, realistic moments of doubt, compassion and unity, Peirce expresses ideas about how our soldiers are being treated by the system, and without raising banners makes important questions about the nature of the war itself. This isn't a Michael Moore film, but it is an intelligent film that forces the audience to consider ideas and opinions as they are entertained by the main character's intense, uncertain quest.There is some controversy generated over the film's main focus, the issue of ""stop-losses"" in the military where soldiers are forced to recycle service in Iraq or Afghanistan. Does it happen? According to official records it does. Does it happen exactly as in the movie? Maybe not, but keep in mind that films are forced to condense information for the sake of time and drama. Those who have questions should simply look-up any news or scholarship on the subject. Others are also angry at the depictions of soldiers coming back scarred from war, with serious emotional problems. Again, Peirce is not saying this is the ENTIRE experience for soldiers, her film is focusing on this particular, well-documented side of what soldiers returning from Iraq are going through.""Stop-Loss"" is a moving, heartfelt picture, and yet the controversy expressed by some reviews should be expected. This is one of those special films that has important things to say in the age of commercialism, where issues like war and violence are reduced to cartoon junk food like ""Transformers"" or ""Rambo."" This is a film about people who have experienced a war and must deal with the aftermath. It is in the same league as previous statements in previous times like ""Johnny Got His Gun"" or ""Born On The Fourth Of July."" It does not dishonor the troops, on the contrary, it is speaking for those who's conscience is making them think. A previous reviewer mentions that we have a volunteer army, this is true, and because our men in uniform have chosen to defend our country they deserve better than being sent to fight a war without reason, for imperialism and oil.

1141981,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0013FSL1Q,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 11]","****1/2On the day he is to be honorably discharged from the service, decorated army Sergeant Brandon King is ordered to return to duty in Iraq, the latest victim of ""stop-loss,"" a term for when soldiers who have fulfilled the terms of their military contract are denied permission to leave the service under penalty of court martial and imprisonment.  Brandon, caught emotionally off-guard by the news, impulsively decides to go AWOL, leaving his fellow troops to head back to the Middle East without him.  Brandon becomes a fugitive from justice, as much on the run from the memories that haunt him as from the authorities looking to bring him back.A searing expose on the ""backdoor draft,"" ""Stop-Loss"" is an extraordinarily powerful drama that shows how men and women who have bravely served their country on the field of battle (along with the loved ones they have left behind) are being betrayed by the very government they fought to defend.  Yet, ""Stop-Loss"" is no star-turn polemic like ""Lions for Lambs,"" but, rather, an intensely personal drama that illuminates its issue in starkly human terms.  The grim realities of post-war trauma - both physical and psychological - are vividly dramatized in the persons of Brandon and his buddies, all of whom have returned to their small Texas town radically changed men.  But the film is also about that special sense of camaraderie and group cohesion that develops among soldiers who have fought side by side under hellish circumstances - and the lifelong bond that results.Despite the wide-ranging nature of the theme, writer/director Kimberley (""Boys Don't Cry"") Peirce and co-writer Mark Richard keep the drama modest in scope and intimate in scale.  It's true that there are times when the screenplay threatens to fall victim to its own contrivance, but the quality of performance and authenticity of detail always bring the movie back into line.Long a fine but under-appreciated actor, Ryan Philippe truly comes into his own in this film, delivering a performance of such raw truth and emotional complexity that we literally cannot take our eyes off him for the duration of the movie.  Ditto for Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Victor Rasuk, all equally superb as men who served alongside Brandon in Iraq and who now have their own personal, war-related demons to wage battle against.  Abbie Cornish is also excellent as the friend who accompanies Brandon on his panic-stricken flight across the country.There are those who will object to ""Stop-Loss"" on strictly political grounds, seeing it as yet another anti-war diatribe designed to make the Bush administration look bad.  Yet, the film transcends politics, honoring the bravery and valor of the soldiers while reserving the right to question the wisdom and morality of those in power who would send these fine young men on such a fool's errand in the first place - and then insist on doing it over and over again.

If you are against the U.S. involvement, then the plight of the main characters will move you because you can blame the government for destroying young lives, and probably love the film.  If you support the war, then you will want Sgt. King (Ryan Phillippe's character) captured and court-martialed. Since that doesn't happen, you will probably hate the film. Either way, this film will bring out the emotions.The film has four weaknesses. First, we don't know the motivations behind King's decision, and I don't think the viewer was supposed to guess.  Was it fear, was it guilt, was it selfishness, was it because he felt duped, was it all four?Second, King visits the parents of deceased soldiers and visits one who is severly wounded, but will live.  I thought this was gratuitous, and the subliminal message these scenes conveyed was that U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan is wrong.Third, King going AWOL seemed a contrived way of him visiting the families of deceased soldiers and his friend at the VA hospital.Fourth, the main theme of the film is the political message, so the context which is was presented around, such as the adjusting to life, the other soldiers who didn't get stop-lossed got ignored.That said, the strength of the film was in the performances. I think Ryan Phillippe is one of the most underrated actors around today.  I dare say, he is the James Cagney or Robert De Niro of his generation. I did have issues with this character's motivation, but I connected with him nevertheless. Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt both gave strong performances, which led to a weakness of the film; I wanted to see more of their characters, and their stories. And Victor Rasuk, in a small role, also connected with me. Despite the underlying message, I thought the ""sad scenes"" with the family and hospital visits were touching.The dvd also has some extras which add value to the film, ie, if I saw it in the theatres, I'd have given it a three.  The deleted scenes answers some questions I had about the plot, and the making of and the day in boot camp were also informative.",4,A Very Politically Charged Film,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,2198,"['views', 'Iraq', 'War', 'will', 'have', 'definite', 'impact', 'not', 'film', 'are', 'U.S.', 'involvement', 'then', 'plight', 'main', 'characters', 'will', 'move', 'can', 'blame', 'government', 'destroying', 'young', 'lives', 'probably', 'love', 'film', 'support', 'war', 'then', 'will', 'want', 'Sgt', 'King', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'character', 'captured', 'court-martialed', ""n't"", 'happen', 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'film', 'way', 'film', 'will', 'bring', 'out', 'emotions.The', 'film', 'four', 'weaknesses', 'First', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'motivations', 'King', 'decision', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'viewer', 'was', 'supposed', 'guess', 'Was', 'fear', 'was', 'guilt', 'was', 'selfishness', 'was', 'felt', 'duped', 'was', 'four', 'Second', 'King', 'parents', 'deceased', 'soldiers', 'visits', 'one', 'who', 'severly', 'wounded', 'will', 'live', 'thought', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'subliminal', 'message', 'scenes', 'conveyed', 'was', 'U.S.', 'involvement', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'wrong.Third', 'King', 'going', 'AWOL', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'way', 'visiting', 'families', 'deceased', 'soldiers', 'friend', 'VA', 'hospital.Fourth', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'political', 'message', 'context', 'was', 'presented', 'around', 'such', 'adjusting', 'life', 'other', 'soldiers', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'stop-lossed', 'got', 'ignored.That', 'said', 'strength', 'film', 'was', 'performances', 'think', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'today', 'dare', 'say', 'James', 'Cagney', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'generation', 'did', 'have', 'issues', 'character', 'motivation', 'connected', 'nevertheless', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'gave', 'strong', 'performances', 'led', 'weakness', 'film', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'characters', 'stories', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'small', 'role', 'also', 'connected', 'underlying', 'message', 'thought', 'sad', 'scenes', 'family', 'hospital', 'visits', 'were', 'touching.The', 'dvd', 'also', 'extras', 'add', 'value', 'film', 'ie', 'saw', 'theatres', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'answers', 'questions', 'had', 'plot', 'making', 'day', 'boot', 'camp', 'were', 'also', 'informative']",Stop-Loss

Brandon believes that he is wrapping up his military career when he gets an unpleasant surprise:  he has been stop-lossed.  Unfortunately, due to the shortage of service members, the government has decreed that his contract with them be extended, thus making his eligible to be sent back to the Middle East for another tour.

1141986,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B0013FSL1Q,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[4, 6]","""Stop-Loss,"" the second feature film directed by Kimberly Peirce, focuses on a group of army buddies.  We see them in a fire fight in Tikrit, Iraq that leaves several in their squad either dead or severely injured.Their leader, Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe), is thrilled to complete his tour of duty and return to his Texas hometown.  There, he is greeted as a hero, decorated with the Bronze Star and Purple Heart, and told by his senator to look him up in Washington if he needs anything.  Civilian life is looking good to Brandon when he is unexpectedly ordered back to Iraq, or stop-lossed.Outraged at the army's failure to fulfill its part of his contract, Brandon decides to fight the order.  Instead of going back to base, he goes to Washington to seek the help of the senator.  But because he is AWOL, the senator will not see him.  He has become a fugitive, with both military and local police looking for him.This is the first film about Iraq to really engage the viewer.  ""Rendition,"" ""Redacted,"" and ""Lions for Lambs"" were more preachy than entertaining, and never attracted large audiences.  ""Stop-Loss"" is a far more personal look at the human dimension of one policy, rather than an outright condemnation of the war,Brandon and his pals Steve (Channing Tatum), Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and Rico (Victor Rasuk) are good soldiers.  They do their duty, facing danger at every turn without complaint.  In fact, Steve objects when he learns that Brandon is going against orders to fight a system he feels is unjust.  Brandon refers to the stop-loss policy as a back-door draft -- keeping soldiers after their contracts are up because recruitment is down and every one is needed to fight in either Iraq or Afghanistan.At first, Peirce wanted to make a documentary about the stop-loss policy and interviewed some actual soldiers, but eventually settled on this fictional film using stop-loss as its key plot point.  She may have been too ambitious in telling Brandon's story and intercutting it with Tommy's self-destructive alcoholism and Steve's shaky relationship with his girlfriend, Michele (Amy Cornish).  Earlier films, such as ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Coming Home,"" have dealt with post-war trauma of returning soldiers, so the scenes involving Tommy and Steve are pretty predictable.  Phillippe is a fine actor who is just now getting larger roles in films.  He was excellent in both ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Breach,"" and now adds another exceptional performance with ""Stop-Loss.""  With a believable Texas twang, his Brandon registers as a regular guy who has become an excellent soldier.  He would no more think of disobeying an order than juggling scorpions.  He is respectful, honest, obedient, and courageous.  But he never comes across as a goody-goody.  He enjoys kicking back a few beers and raising hell on Saturday night with his pals.  So his Everyman is a guy we look up to.  When he decides to go AWOL, it is both dramatic and shocking.  Phillippe portrays Brandon not as a guy who wants to run.  His first instinct is to right an injustice, but the army, politics, and bureaucracy conspire against him.The film has great strengths.  The opening sequence, beautifully staged and edited, shows Brandon in Iraq leading his men into what turns out to be an ambush.  We get a real feel for the fear that soldiers deployed in Iraq must undergo.  Trapped in a narrow alley, their vehicle and heavy machine gun destroyed, they have to battle gunfire from the roofs on both sides of the street, sheltering in strange buildings where death can wait at every turn.  These scenes rank with the most realistic movie battle scenes.Another strong scene is Brandon's visit to Rico in a veteran's hospital.  Rico is severely disabled from the ambush in Iraq, yet retains his sense of humor and optimism.  As squad leader, Brandon feels responsibility for Rico's condition, yet is helpless to do more than pay him a visit and offer encouragement.  Rasuk, first seen on screen five years ago in ""Raising Victor Vargas,"" is a natural actor with great charm.  His small role and one memorable scene add resonance to the story, contrasting Rico's constructive attitude with Tommy's inability to get a grip on civilian life.I was happy to see that Peirce avoided typical pitfalls.  A road trip Brandon takes with Michele, for example, remains just that, with no romantic complications.  The relationship between Brandon and his buddy's girlfriend is not typical Hollywood, and that's precisely why it rings true.""Stop-Loss,"" rated R, is both the engaging story of one soldier trapped by an unfair, desperate practice, and a cautionary tale of how government policy can betray those who fight our wars.",4,"Soldier Rebels Against ""Back Door Draft""",1222300800,"09 25,

I suspect that some people cheered his actions; after all, the Iraq war is very unpopular and seen as unjust by many people.  However, it was never clear to me why King was so upset about his stop-loss.  Was he afraid of getting killed (he mentioned this a few times), was he suffering from PTSD and needed help (perhaps), or was he just mad that he wasn't informed earlier (seems so)?  With such murky intentions, the character comes off as unlikeable and petulant at times.  This problem made his journey far less impactful than it should have been, even when he meets with one of his former battalion members who was severely injured.  Also, as others here have mentioned, it just didn't seem realistic that he was told at such a late time that he was stop-lossed.  This detail and a few other issues again really impacted the movie for me.  Ryan Phillippe also gives a bland performance, which further dilutes the message and emotional impact.  His accent at times is so heavy it's hard to understand him and then it's nearly gone at other times.  What starts off as a powerful examination of war and its effects ends up a total mess - what a shame.",2,"""Your country needs you to go back.""",1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,2381,"['Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Brandon', 'King', 'leader', 'battalion', 'fighting', 'small', 'town', 'Iraq', 'One', 'day', 'battalion', 'attacked', 'Iraqis', 'taxicab', 'King', 'men', 'chase', 'culprits', 'chase', 'alleyway', 'where', 'pursue', 'foot', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'ambushed', 'several', 'King', 'men', 'are', 'killed', 'then', 'flash', 'forward', 'King', 'pals', 'going', 'back', 'home', 'Texas', 'leave', 'including', 'King', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'talk', 'plans', '.and', 'get', 'drunk', 'fight', 'play', 'guns', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'stable', 'may', 'be', 'related', 'flashbacks', 'have', 'atrocities', 'Iraq', 'leave', 'draws', 'close', 'King', 'back', 'base', 'one', 'final', 'check-in', 'anticipating', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'civilian', 'However', 'when', 'check-out', 'informed', 'random', 'bureaucrat', 'go', 'back', 'Iraq', 'been', 'stop-lossed', 'King', 'outraged', 'out', 'few', 'soldiers', 'home', 'rest', 'movie', 'there', 'Stop-Loss', 'off', 'very', 'strong', 'nice', 'characterizations', 'really', 'chance', 'having', 'protagonist', 'take', 'less', 'heroic', 'stance', 'suspect', 'people', 'cheered', 'actions', 'Iraq', 'war', 'very', 'unpopular', 'seen', 'unjust', 'many', 'people', 'However', 'was', 'never', 'clear', 'why', 'King', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'stop-loss', 'getting', 'killed', 'mentioned', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'suffering', 'PTSD', 'needed', 'help', 'perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'mad', 'was', ""n't"", 'informed', 'earlier', 'so', 'such', 'murky', 'intentions', 'character', 'off', 'unlikeable', 'petulant', 'times', 'problem', 'made', 'journey', 'far', 'less', 'impactful', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'former', 'battalion', 'members', 'who', 'was', 'severely', 'injured', 'Also', 'others', 'here', 'have', 'mentioned', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realistic', 'was', 'told', 'late', 'time', 'was', 'stop-lossed', 'detail', 'few', 'other', 'issues', 'again', 'really', 'impacted', 'movie', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'also', 'bland', 'performance', 'further', 'message', 'emotional', 'impact', 'accent', 'times', 'so', 'heavy', 'hard', 'understand', 'then', 'nearly', 'gone', 'other', 'times', 'What', 'off', 'powerful', 'examination', 'war', 'effects', 'up', 'total', 'mess', 'what', 'shame']",Stop-Loss

Try to put your politics aside and just appreciate this film as a first-rate piece of cinematic art with powerful performances by the entire cast.  There is not one weak performance.  I also urge those who are obsessed with military technical accuracy to put their quibbles aside.

However, for all its intentions, the movie misses the target and becomes a mess of disjointed portrayals of flashback induced psychological struggles for the main characters. Bad choices by two of the primary actors (Phillippe and Cornish) to attempt to Texas accents end up having them sound mentally deficient in Phillippe's case - or just plain unintelligible in the case of Cornish.  Cornish's performance is flat and uninteresting - a total snoozer.  Phillippe started out rather engaging and was strong in the scene where he gave an akward speeech at his home town welcome parade - however his attempts at portraying stronger emotions felt forced and over the top.  Bad directing and a poor script added to the mess of the film.  Rating is two stars because some of the supporting cast was worth watching - otherwise skip this one.",2,Skip this one unless you are desperate,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,975,"['Stop', 'Loss', 'was', 'swing', 'miss', 'topic', 'interesting', 'one', ""n't"", 'received', 'lot', 'attention', 'soldiers', 'required', 'reup', 'However', 'intentions', 'movie', 'target', 'mess', 'disjointed', 'portrayals', 'flashback', 'induced', 'psychological', 'struggles', 'main', 'characters', 'Bad', 'choices', 'two', 'primary', 'actors', 'Phillippe', 'Cornish', 'attempt', 'Texas', 'accents', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'sound', 'mentally', 'deficient', 'Phillippe', 'case', 'just', 'plain', 'unintelligible', 'case', 'Cornish', 'Cornish', 'performance', 'flat', 'uninteresting', 'total', 'snoozer', 'Phillippe', 'started', 'out', 'rather', 'engaging', 'was', 'strong', 'scene', 'where', 'gave', 'akward', 'speeech', 'home', 'town', 'welcome', 'parade', 'however', 'attempts', 'portraying', 'stronger', 'emotions', 'felt', 'forced', 'top', 'Bad', 'directing', 'poor', 'script', 'added', 'mess', 'film', 'Rating', 'two', 'stars', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'otherwise', 'skip', 'one']",Stop-Loss
