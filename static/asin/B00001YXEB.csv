512386,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B00001YXEB,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[4, 12]","On one hand, this film is a (mostly) faithful rendition of Stowe's 1852 anti-slavery novel. It also provides a rare example of early synchronized sound prior to the days of talking films. However, this movie (alas, as well as the book) is grossly patronizing today. James B. Lowe as Uncle Tom gives a far more dignified performance for a Black actor than was typical of 1927, but the incredibly gross Blackfaced performance of Topsy (the inspiration for Buckwheat and Farina's outfits in ""Our Gang"") is truly stomach-turning. A deleted scene shows Topsy saying ""I can't be good cause I'se a (n-word)."" (This scene is sadly straight from the book). Wisely, the New York Censors edited this out in 1927. However, what remains in the film is not much better.In some ways, this film is the flipside to ""Birth of a Nation,"" which is now considered the most antiblack film of all time. George Seigmann, who played the villan Silas Lynch in Blackface in BON, plays white Simon Legree in this film. This time, it's Seigmann's white character who tries to rape the Black feamle slaves as opposed to his role as the Black rapist of White women in the former film. Also, this film's ending (which I won't describe in detail here) is the exact opposite of the KKK to the rescue climax of BON. Let's just say it's one part that's not faithful to Stowe's book.Despite it's good intentions, the over-the-top melodrama, the gross stereotyping, and overall bleakness of this film doomed it at the box office in 1927, and it's still not the type of film that you'll invite your friends over for beer and pizza to watch today. But if you're a film historian or interested in impressions of 19th century America, THEN you might like it.",3,Interesting only for historical reasons,1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,1716,"['one', 'hand', 'film', 'mostly', 'faithful', 'rendition', 'Stowe', '1852', 'anti-slavery', 'novel', 'also', 'rare', 'example', 'early', 'synchronized', 'sound', 'prior', 'days', 'talking', 'films', 'However', 'movie', 'alas', 'as', 'well', 'book', 'grossly', 'patronizing', 'today', 'James', 'B.', 'Lowe', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'far', 'more', 'dignified', 'performance', 'Black', 'actor', 'was', 'typical', '1927', 'incredibly', 'gross', 'Blackfaced', 'performance', 'Topsy', 'inspiration', 'Buckwheat', 'Farina', 'outfits', 'Gang', 'truly', 'stomach-turning', 'deleted', 'scene', 'shows', 'Topsy', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'cause', 'n-word', 'scene', 'sadly', 'straight', 'book', 'Wisely', 'New', 'York', 'Censors', 'edited', 'out', '1927', 'However', 'what', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'ways', 'film', 'flipside', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'now', 'considered', 'most', 'antiblack', 'film', 'time', 'George', 'Seigmann', 'who', 'played', 'villan', 'Silas', 'Lynch', 'Blackface', 'BON', 'white', 'Simon', 'Legree', 'film', 'time', 'Seigmann', 'white', 'character', 'who', 'rape', 'Black', 'feamle', 'slaves', 'opposed', 'role', 'Black', 'rapist', 'White', 'women', 'former', 'film', 'Also', 'film', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'detail', 'here', 'exact', 'opposite', 'KKK', 'rescue', 'climax', 'BON', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'one', 'part', 'not', 'faithful', 'Stowe', 'book.Despite', 'good', 'intentions', 'over-the-top', 'melodrama', 'gross', 'stereotyping', 'overall', 'bleakness', 'film', 'doomed', 'box', 'office', '1927', 'still', 'not', 'type', 'film', ""'ll"", 'invite', 'friends', 'beer', 'pizza', 'watch', 'today', ""'re"", 'film', 'historian', 'interested', 'impressions', '19th', 'century', 'America', 'THEN', 'might', 'like']",N/A

I'm an Australian living in Sydney so I don't know much about US History or the details of social and racial issues of the US, nor have I ever even heard of the book ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" but none of these things prevented me from being deeply moved, impressed and inspired by this film.  It has some very heart-wrenching scenes, great suspense, deep emotions and overall extremely good acting.  It didn't bother me that some white actors played black roles or that some actors appeared older than their characters  because I tend to follow the story and the emotions, ideals and feelings expressed in a film.  Another feature that impressed me was the music that suited each scene perfectly, and I have to admit, I was moved to tears by the scene of Topsy crying over the death of Miss Eva while a choral version of Dvorak's New World Symphony Largo played - one of my favourite pieces, but never so deeply moving as in this scene!  In my opinion, the musical score added a special touch and extra dimension.I would highly recommend this DVD for all non-Americans, or even to anyone who enjoys a very high quality silent movie because a knowledge of US history or other issues is definitely no prerequisite to enjoying this excellent film!",5,Not just for Americans and Historians!,1081814400,"04 13, 2004",2004,1401,"['was', 'little', 'hesitant', 'order', 'DVD', 'first', 'especially', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'comments', 'racial', 'issues', 'decided', 'get', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'Australian', 'living', 'Sydney', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'US', 'History', 'details', 'social', 'racial', 'issues', 'US', 'have', 'ever', 'even', 'heard', 'book', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'Cabin', 'none', 'things', 'prevented', 'being', 'deeply', 'moved', 'impressed', 'inspired', 'film', 'very', 'heart-wrenching', 'scenes', 'great', 'suspense', 'deep', 'emotions', 'overall', 'extremely', 'good', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'white', 'actors', 'played', 'black', 'roles', 'actors', 'appeared', 'older', 'characters', 'tend', 'follow', 'story', 'emotions', 'ideals', 'feelings', 'expressed', 'film', 'feature', 'impressed', 'was', 'music', 'suited', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'moved', 'tears', 'scene', 'Topsy', 'crying', 'death', 'Miss', 'Eva', 'choral', 'version', 'Dvorak', 'New', 'World', 'Symphony', 'Largo', 'played', 'one', 'favourite', 'pieces', 'never', 'so', 'deeply', 'moving', 'as', 'scene', 'opinion', 'musical', 'score', 'added', 'special', 'touch', 'extra', 'dimension.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'non-Americans', 'even', 'anyone', 'who', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'silent', 'movie', 'knowledge', 'US', 'history', 'other', 'issues', 'definitely', 'prerequisite', 'enjoying', 'excellent', 'film']",N/A
512388,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B00001YXEB,Chip Kaufmann,"[2, 2]","Long before 12 YEARS A SLAVE or DJANGO UNCHAINED or even ROOTS back in 1977, there was UNCLE TOM'S CABIN. First a groundbreaking abolitionist novel in 1852 by Harriet Beecher Stowe, it became a staple of 19th century theater after the Civil War. Those theatrical productions stressed the epic aspects of the book while turning the characters into archetypes that became stereotypes. Once the new medium of film arrived there were no less than 10 silent versions before this one. The most prominent and noteworthy being Edwin S, Porter's 1903 version which is staged as a series of tableaux involving the novel's main scenes including an impressive (for 1903) ice floe sequence. Before the era of radio and television and even film, the story of UNCLE TOM'S CABIN was well known to audiences all over the country, even in the South, and it could always be counted on to pack em' in and turn a profit.As the silent era drew to a close Carl Laemmle, the head of Universal, decided to mount this lavish production which can easily be thought of as a silent version of GONE WITH THE WIND. At a cost of almost $2 million in 1927 currency and over 2 years in production, the film was one of the most expensive movies of the silent era. In addition to the trials and tribulations of the cast and crew over such a lengthy period, director Harry Pollard fell ill with a dental infection and had to undergo 6 operations. The ice floe sequence was originally filmed on location on a frozen river in the Northeast but, like D.W. Griffith's sequence in WAY DOWN EAST, most of it wound up being duplicated in the studio. Then right after the picture is ready for release, sound arrives and the film has to be refitted with a 1928 soundtrack of music and effects causing more delays. By the time it finally hit the screen, UNCLE TOM'S CABIN seemed old fashioned and wound up losing money.The most difficult aspect for a 21st century audience is to try and view UNCLE TOM'S CABIN as a product of its time. Even in 1927 it was a cross between Progressive Era thinking and 19th century theatrical traditons. The casting of white actors in the major ""mixed race"" roles and the slave girl Topsy in blackface is hard to accept today yet it was standard practice then and the performances, though highly melodramatic, are effective. The two ""modern"" performances come from James T. Lowe as an intelligent, strong, and sympathetic Tom (he resembles Samuel L. Jackson) and George Siegmann as Simon Legree who could give 12 YEARS' Michael Fassbender a run for his money. Considering when it was made, the horrors of slavery are not glossed over and the movie winds up being a cross between GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 YEARS A SLAVE. Fascinating yet appalling, still engaging, and a history lesson on slavery and the public's expectations at that time.P.S. The film's running time is 112 minutes not the 144 minutes listed here. That was the original running time before the film was shortened and altered by distributors and exhibitors after its initial preview.

512389,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,B00001YXEB,KinoChelovek,"[0, 0]","I am writing this review as someone who has not read the Harriet Beecher Stowe novel (probably a mistake on my part), but am extremely into film analysis and history. I wll stay away from any social commentary other than that which is related to this movie.This is Universal Studio's feature film which portrays African-Americans in silent era cinema (as opposed to ""The Jazz Singer"" - Warner Bros - or UA's ""The Birth of a Nation"", for other studio examples).  There are numerous black actors in the movie, but they are given highly stereotyped roles (dialogue, facial expressions, costumes, hair styles).  However, this was a rule in Hollywood, and still is to some extent.  It is also a large problem that I have with this movie.  To be fair, it is also, probably, how the novel portrays them.  What bothers me more with the movie is how none of the main ""lighter-skinned black"" characters are portrayed by African-Americans, even though several are background characters that could have easily be given those roles, and it would be an even more important film if the producers did such.This movie was made for a huge budget: $1.8 million!  It was one of the last silent movies.  It was produced by German-Jewish ex-pat Carl Laemmle (founder of Universal).  It has a mainly African-American cast (although they are in much lesser roles).  It is based on the ""notorious"" book from the 1850s.  These are great reasons for it's historical importance.As far as a movie, it has many problems.  It includes the Civil War years.  The young girl, Eva St. Clair, and Harry (or anyone else) never age.  I constantly questioned whether Harry was male or female (a title card says male, but....).  Very little story is about Uncle Tom.  The use of non-African-American actors and actresses in the main roles is silly.  The narrative, mostly starting with the New Orleans story becomes muddled.  Mona Ray's performance in blackface is surreal and way over-the-top.However, there are many pluses.  We are given a movie that is excellent for analysis on cultural and historical reasons.  This DVD has a great feature which reconstructs missing and edited scenes that have quite a bit of cultural and historical value that make the version that Kino released more narratively sound.  I almost wish these parts were put into the presentation and a second disc would have the version that is presented in this DVD.  For example, the disjointed dialogue between Eva and Topsy is makes more sense with the (now considered) ""derogatory"" dialogue between them (the scene where Topsy talks about being ""bad"").  This extra feature is invaluable and shows how the final product is edited (censored) to keep a type of universal audience while trying not to denigrate anyone.  This is the main reason for my 4-stars, otherwise the movie is nearly surreal and confusing.Also worth noting is the excellent transfer and some interesting special effects through the pre-CGI process known as optical printing.4 stars for the importance and transfer by Kino.  4 1/2 for the extras.  Well worth the purchase for the student of films!Casual film watchers will probably be bored, annoyed, especially by the heavy use of melodrama, a staple of silent cinema.",4,Interesting Historic Film - Great Extras,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,3224,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'read', 'Harriet', 'Beecher', 'Stowe', 'novel', 'probably', 'mistake', 'part', 'am', 'extremely', 'film', 'analysis', 'history', 'wll', 'stay', 'away', 'social', 'commentary', 'other', 'related', 'movie.This', 'Universal', 'Studio', 'feature', 'film', 'African-Americans', 'silent', 'era', 'cinema', 'opposed', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'UA', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'other', 'studio', 'examples', 'are', 'numerous', 'black', 'actors', 'movie', 'are', 'given', 'highly', 'stereotyped', 'roles', 'dialogue', 'facial', 'expressions', 'costumes', 'hair', 'styles', 'However', 'was', 'rule', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'extent', 'also', 'large', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'be', 'fair', 'also', 'probably', 'how', 'novel', 'What', 'more', 'movie', 'how', 'none', 'main', 'lighter-skinned', 'black', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'African-Americans', 'even', 'several', 'are', 'background', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'be', 'given', 'roles', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'film', 'producers', 'did', 'such.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'huge', 'budget', '1.8', 'million', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'silent', 'movies', 'was', 'produced', 'German-Jewish', 'ex-pat', 'Carl', 'Laemmle', 'founder', 'Universal', 'mainly', 'African-American', 'cast', 'are', 'much', 'lesser', 'roles', 'based', 'notorious', 'book', '1850s', 'are', 'great', 'reasons', 'historical', 'importance.As', 'far', 'movie', 'many', 'problems', 'Civil', 'War', 'years', 'young', 'girl', 'Eva', 'St.', 'Clair', 'Harry', 'anyone', 'else', 'never', 'age', 'constantly', 'questioned', 'Harry', 'was', 'male', 'female', 'title', 'card', 'male', 'Very', 'little', 'story', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'use', 'non-African-American', 'actors', 'actresses', 'main', 'roles', 'silly', 'narrative', 'mostly', 'starting', 'New', 'Orleans', 'story', 'muddled', 'Mona', 'Ray', 'performance', 'blackface', 'surreal', 'way', 'over-the-top.However', 'are', 'many', 'pluses', 'are', 'given', 'movie', 'excellent', 'analysis', 'cultural', 'historical', 'reasons', 'DVD', 'great', 'feature', 'missing', 'edited', 'scenes', 'have', 'quite', 'bit', 'cultural', 'historical', 'value', 'make', 'version', 'Kino', 'released', 'more', 'narratively', 'sound', 'almost', 'wish', 'parts', 'were', 'put', 'presentation', 'second', 'disc', 'would', 'have', 'version', 'presented', 'DVD', 'example', 'disjointed', 'dialogue', 'Eva', 'Topsy', 'more', 'sense', 'now', 'considered', 'derogatory', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'where', 'Topsy', 'being', 'bad', 'extra', 'feature', 'invaluable', 'how', 'final', 'product', 'edited', 'censored', 'keep', 'type', 'universal', 'audience', 'trying', 'not', 'denigrate', 'anyone', 'main', 'reason', '4-stars', 'otherwise', 'movie', 'nearly', 'surreal', 'confusing.Also', 'worth', 'noting', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'interesting', 'special', 'effects', 'pre-CGI', 'process', 'known', 'optical', 'printing.4', 'stars', 'importance', 'transfer', 'Kino', '4', '1/2', 'extras', 'Well', 'purchase', 'student', 'films', 'Casual', 'film', 'watchers', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'bored', 'annoyed', 'especially', 'heavy', 'use', 'melodrama', 'staple', 'silent', 'cinema']",N/A

512392,A2H9LUUCYE0KJC,B00001YXEB,Mr Peter G George,"[24, 29]","I wanted to like this film more than I eventually did. It has some very fine moments, not least Eliza's flight across the ice, which is only just behind Lilian Gish's ice flow scene in Way Down East. This adaptation of Uncle Tom's Cabin however, has a number of flaws. The biggest difficulty is that it is set just prior to and during the civil war. Stowe's book was published in 1852 and really the story only makes sense when it is depicting a time prior to the 1850's. It must also be said that some of the acting in this film is not too good. James Lowe, who is the only major African American actor in the cast, is very good indeed. His performance is dignified and in the end heartbreaking. But we have to accept a quite absurd Topsy played by a teenage white girl in blackface. Moreover, Eliza (played by the director's wife) is patently too old for the part, she looks about the same age as her mother. Also the makers of this film decided that all of the 'fair-skinned' African American characters would be played by white people with so little make up that they look scarcely different from the white characters. This was to avoid offending contemporary audiences. This leads though, to some initial confusion regarding the status of characters and somewhat undermines the anti-slavery theme of the story. The print used on this DVD is pretty good. I would have preffered some colour tinting, but it is clear and has very little damage. The DVD also has the bonus of two interesting deleted scenes and some stills of some further deleted scenes. The music on the DVD is on the whole fine, but has a number of scenes where there is singing on the soundtrack which does not synchronise with the singer. This is a feature of some late silents, but I must admit I do not care for it.
