1066439,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000OXEP4U,Jeffery Mingo,"[7, 16]","A married woman has an affair with a male high school graduate.  This is a B-movie meant for those seeking titillation.Wearing my feminist cap, it's good that older woman-younger man movies can be made and not just older man-younger woman ones.  But that's where the good stuff stops.  In typical, heteropatriarchal fashion, there is female nudity here, but no male nudity.In the same way that ""Juwanna Mann"" asked all the given questions about a man posing as a female basketball player, this asks all the questions you'd expect.  Will the husband find out?  Why isn't the younger man seeking women his age?  Will the younger man's parents find out?  How long can this relationship last?  It's funny that many American filmmakers and television producers are squeamish about teen sexuality, and yet the young lover here is constantly drinking alcohol though he's probably 18 and not 21.The ending may surprise some, but it will be obvious to many.",1,Predictable!,1183507200,"07 4, 2007",2007,948,"['married', 'woman', 'affair', 'male', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'B-movie', 'meant', 'seeking', 'titillation.Wearing', 'feminist', 'cap', 'good', 'older', 'woman-younger', 'man', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'not', 'just', 'older', 'man-younger', 'woman', 'ones', 'where', 'good', 'stuff', 'stops', 'typical', 'heteropatriarchal', 'fashion', 'female', 'nudity', 'here', 'male', 'same', 'way', 'Juwanna', 'Mann', 'asked', 'given', 'questions', 'man', 'posing', 'female', 'basketball', 'player', 'questions', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Will', 'husband', 'find', 'out', 'Why', ""n't"", 'younger', 'man', 'seeking', 'women', 'age', 'Will', 'younger', 'man', 'parents', 'find', 'out', 'How', 'long', 'can', 'relationship', 'last', 'funny', 'many', 'American', 'filmmakers', 'television', 'producers', 'are', 'squeamish', 'teen', 'sexuality', 'yet', 'young', 'lover', 'here', 'constantly', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'probably', '18', 'not', '21.The', 'ending', 'may', 'surprise', 'will', 'be', 'obvious', 'many']",N/A

Joan plays a bored housewife (Lisa), who starts having an affair with a much younger, right out of high school guy.  Corbin Bernsen plays the unknowing husband.  the story is somewhat good and watchable.  The photography is not that great.  But lets get down to it, the only reason to watch it to begin with is because of Joan Severance.Some of Joan's other works are a little better than this one, such as Payback, and Dangerous Indiscretions.  But the movie over all was not bad, decent plot and good acting.  Joan Definitely sizzled and was perfect to play the part.  There was some great nudity in the unrated version.  Joan Severance still has an amazing body.  The Photography does show Joan's wonderful attributes several times, however, photography could have been much better with angles, lighting, and a little more time for Joan to astonish.Sex and consequences is worth seeing if only for Joan Severance's captivating acting and great body.  Good acting, plot, and nude scenes(although the nude scenes could have been longer with better photography).  Joan Severance still has it, and hopefully will star in more films soon.",3,Joan Severance is back,1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,1169,"['Joan', 'Severance', 'finally', 'back', 'Joan', 'bored', 'housewife', 'Lisa', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'much', 'younger', 'right', 'high', 'school', 'guy', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'unknowing', 'husband', 'story', 'somewhat', 'good', 'watchable', 'photography', 'not', 'great', 'get', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'begin', 'Joan', 'Severance.Some', 'Joan', 'other', 'works', 'are', 'little', 'better', 'one', 'such', 'Payback', 'Dangerous', 'Indiscretions', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'decent', 'plot', 'good', 'acting', 'Joan', 'Definitely', 'sizzled', 'was', 'perfect', 'play', 'part', 'was', 'great', 'nudity', 'unrated', 'version', 'Joan', 'Severance', 'still', 'amazing', 'body', 'Photography', 'show', 'Joan', 'wonderful', 'several', 'times', 'however', 'photography', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'angles', 'lighting', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'Joan', 'astonish.Sex', 'consequences', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'Joan', 'Severance', 'captivating', 'acting', 'great', 'body', 'Good', 'acting', 'plot', 'nude', 'scenes', 'nude', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'better', 'photography', 'Joan', 'Severance', 'still', 'hopefully', 'will', 'star', 'more', 'films', 'soon']",N/A
