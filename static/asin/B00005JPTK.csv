We've had a lot of vampire and zombie movies over the years and many post-apocalyptic movies. I like 'em even if they aren't done that well, as does apparently a large swath of the public. So, I say the first half or so is excellent. Seeing a realistic depiction of a large city devoid of human beings, crumbling bit by bit, nature all around reclaiming ground, is interesting. New York City is the most cinematic location to digitally degrade with cutting edge computer effects with it's famous monuments and streets and gigantic skyskrappers and celebrated bridges. I've found Will Smith to not always be the most interesting actor but his performance works. Basically Smith is a military scientist in responsible for finding a cure for a super-virus similar to the disease in 28 WEEKS LATTER which turns people into fleshing eating crazed turbo-vombies. Luckily for Smith the ghouls in this flick are like vampires destroyed by sunlight. This allows him free reign over almost all of Manhattan during the day, except of course the insides of darkened buildings where monsters shelter themselves from deadly ultraviolet light. Meeting the monsters is the highlight of the movie for me. I was nervous. As for these transformed mutants of the night, they sound scary and look deformed by disease but fake. For the longest time I've said use make-up and masks when you can and cost effective computer effects for the extras--for the background zombies or zombies in dark environments when detail is less an issue. Up close in the light you got video game level quality and that is very lame. Things started to go downhill for me with a strange trap Smith gets caught in that I simply didn't buy and never found a good explaination for. After this his character is disapointing when confronted with a painful loss. Then we discover he is a man without faith in god which is a bad thing?? Not sure where they were going with that and if we're supposed to believe he got it back I simply missed that part--not that I cared in the first place. Without spoiling anything, the final nail on the coffin is the absurd conclusion to Smith's story. The timing of it! Yeah okay. And speaking of timing, got to love the scene on the wharf. Just in the nick of time, outta nowhere...What are those odds? In the end the movie wraps up and your just left with an uninteresting conventional movie.",2,First half 4 Stars  /  Second half 1 Star,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,2486,"['Maybe', 'last', 'third', 'What', 'went', 'wrong', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'What', 'pity', ""'ve"", 'had', 'lot', 'vampire', 'zombie', 'movies', 'years', 'many', 'post-apocalyptic', 'movies', 'like', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'done', 'well', 'apparently', 'large', 'swath', 'public', 'So', 'say', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'excellent', 'Seeing', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'large', 'city', 'devoid', 'human', 'beings', 'crumbling', 'bit', 'bit', 'nature', 'reclaiming', 'ground', 'interesting', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'most', 'cinematic', 'location', 'digitally', 'degrade', 'cutting', 'edge', 'computer', 'effects', 'famous', 'monuments', 'streets', 'gigantic', 'skyskrappers', 'celebrated', 'bridges', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Will', 'Smith', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'actor', 'performance', 'works', 'Basically', 'Smith', 'military', 'scientist', 'responsible', 'finding', 'cure', 'super-virus', 'similar', 'disease', '28', 'WEEKS', 'LATTER', 'people', 'fleshing', 'eating', 'crazed', 'turbo-vombies', 'Luckily', 'Smith', 'ghouls', 'flick', 'are', 'vampires', 'destroyed', 'sunlight', 'free', 'reign', 'almost', 'Manhattan', 'day', 'course', 'insides', 'darkened', 'buildings', 'where', 'monsters', 'shelter', 'deadly', 'ultraviolet', 'light', 'Meeting', 'monsters', 'highlight', 'movie', 'was', 'nervous', 'transformed', 'mutants', 'night', 'sound', 'scary', 'look', 'deformed', 'disease', 'fake', 'longest', 'time', ""'ve"", 'said', 'use', 'make-up', 'masks', 'when', 'can', 'cost', 'effective', 'computer', 'effects', 'extras', 'background', 'zombies', 'dark', 'environments', 'when', 'detail', 'less', 'issue', 'Up', 'close', 'light', 'got', 'video', 'game', 'level', 'quality', 'very', 'lame', 'Things', 'started', 'go', 'downhill', 'strange', 'trap', 'Smith', 'caught', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'never', 'found', 'good', 'explaination', 'character', 'disapointing', 'when', 'confronted', 'painful', 'loss', 'Then', 'discover', 'man', 'faith', 'god', 'bad', 'thing', 'Not', 'sure', 'where', 'were', 'going', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'got', 'back', 'simply', 'missed', 'part', 'not', 'cared', 'first', 'place', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'absurd', 'conclusion', 'Smith', 'story', 'timing', 'Yeah', 'okay', 'speaking', 'timing', 'got', 'love', 'scene', 'wharf', 'Just', 'nick', 'time', 'outta', 'nowhere', 'What', 'are', 'odds', 'end', 'movie', 'up', 'just', 'left', 'uninteresting', 'conventional', 'movie']",I Am Legend

It's dramatic, compelling, bizarre, and it can be rather suspenseful.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: In 2009, a virus ravaged the world and killed most of the population. There is virtually no one left except for the few people who are immune to the virus. But most of the immune were killed off by the infected. One man; Robert Neville; is the last man in Manhattan. He was a military virologist when the outbreak occurred, now he lives in Manhattan with a German shepherd named Samantha, trying to survive and find a cure for the virus and see if there is anyone else left alive.MUSIC: The music is good, especially considering the guy who did this film's music also did the music for The Happening.COMPELLING FACTOR: This film isn't exactly action-oriented, but it is rather great at setting the stage for suspense and dramatic, depressing moments.ENTERTAINMENT: If you're hoping for an action-packed film you're not going to get one. This film is more focused on story and characters than action. It is a compelling movie that is worthy of a purchase. If you easily get bored of movies, you probably won't like this one, but give it a try.OVERALL: There were parts of the movie that got boring, that is the main flaw.

The first part of the plot is very intense and, at times, can be downright scary, even when the ""dark seekers"" are not present.Many people have stated that they did not like the ending, something to which I must agree.  The film loses its momentum towards the end.  I bought the 2-disc version just to get the alternate ending in case something ""better"" was available, but did not think the alternative was much better.  All-in-all, the writers could have done a much better job in incorporating the final sequences to the middle of the story.  But, that can be hard at times when the writers don't get to interact with the directors.Despite that, I still think it is a worthy film to watch.

I don't understand that, I mean what disease would make someone want to eat other people? Even humans with rabies don't attack other humans, they just experience muscle spasms in the throat that effect breathing. They also experience: pain, itching, seizures, paralysis, hallucinations, and eventually death, so I just don't see the link there.

And I haven't seen its original big screen outing, Omega Man, starring Charlton Heston.  However, I recently sat down to watch the latest Will Smith-helmed outing of I Am Legend.  The movie is thrilling, touching, and eye-popping.  It's a great evening's entertainment for fans of action and sci-fi thrillers alike.Smith is the man who is the key to cancer.  The back story tells us that scientists obviously rocked the world when they unlocked this piece of the genetic puzzle.  What they never could have expected was the plague that would claim more lives than cancer ever did.  And that's the backdrop where we get to know Smith's Robert Neville.Neville is the only human left in New York City.  This is the visually stunning part of the film.  The CGI really gives us an amazing view of a broken down, overgrown, post-apocalyptic New York.  Neville roars through the city hunting deer from his Ford Mustang.  Tearing up sidewalks, and dodging busses, our hero hunts wild deer with his faithful dog Sam.At night, the two fortify themselves in Neville's apartment.  They must do this because the plague which rocked the world has turned some of its inhabitants into nocturnal monsters.  They are the key threat to our hero's world, and the one compelling reason that keeps him strong.  He was the one who unlocked Pandora's Box.  And no one else will be able to set things right.Will Smith has come a long way since his Fresh Prince days.  Outings in films like Independence Day, Hitch, Bad Boys, and The Pursuit of Happyness have cemented Smith as a solid leading man.  I Am Legend gives him a chance to really flex his dramatic muscles.  We see Neville as eccentric hermit, grieving husband, and driven hero.I Am Legend delivers a solid story with echoes that may leave you wondering `what if' for some time after.",4,Glad I got to see it,1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,1858,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'Am', 'Legend', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'big', 'screen', 'outing', 'Omega', 'Man', 'starring', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'However', 'recently', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'latest', 'Will', 'Smith-helmed', 'outing', 'Am', 'Legend', 'movie', 'thrilling', 'touching', 'eye-popping', 'great', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'fans', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'thrillers', 'alike.Smith', 'man', 'who', 'key', 'cancer', 'back', 'story', 'tells', 'scientists', 'obviously', 'rocked', 'world', 'when', 'unlocked', 'piece', 'genetic', 'puzzle', 'What', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'expected', 'was', 'plague', 'would', 'claim', 'more', 'lives', 'cancer', 'ever', 'did', 'backdrop', 'where', 'get', 'know', 'Smith', 'Robert', 'Neville.Neville', 'only', 'human', 'left', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'visually', 'stunning', 'part', 'film', 'CGI', 'really', 'amazing', 'view', 'broken', 'down', 'overgrown', 'post-apocalyptic', 'New', 'York', 'Neville', 'city', 'hunting', 'deer', 'Ford', 'Mustang', 'Tearing', 'up', 'sidewalks', 'dodging', 'busses', 'hero', 'hunts', 'wild', 'deer', 'faithful', 'dog', 'Sam.At', 'night', 'two', 'fortify', 'Neville', 'apartment', 'must', 'do', 'plague', 'rocked', 'world', 'turned', 'inhabitants', 'nocturnal', 'monsters', 'are', 'key', 'threat', 'hero', 'world', 'one', 'compelling', 'reason', 'strong', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'unlocked', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'set', 'things', 'right.Will', 'Smith', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'days', 'Outings', 'films', 'Independence', 'Day', 'Hitch', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'have', 'cemented', 'Smith', 'solid', 'leading', 'man', 'Am', 'Legend', 'chance', 'really', 'flex', 'dramatic', 'muscles', 'see', 'Neville', 'eccentric', 'hermit', 'grieving', 'husband', 'driven', 'hero.I', 'Am', 'Legend', 'solid', 'story', 'echoes', 'may', 'leave', 'wondering', 'what', 'time']",I Am Legend

But, a movie needs more than that to be worth anything.I went in expecting a zombie movie (which is partly the fault of the movie execs and how they advertised the movie), and what I got was a half-drama, half-suspense film that was too long for what it was trying to say. Too many scenes with Smith worrying about himbeing the last man on earth. Where Smith usually shines, in his predictable hero-esque roles, he fails here--as a scientist who experiment goes wrong. His acting suits the story, but not the desperation or fear a man in his place may have. The best scene in the movie, and the one that may have been Smith's best acting in the role, involved him and his dog and a fod hunt gone wrong. However, the movie turns or the worse when he realises he may not be the only person still alive. However, by this time in the move, the audience is a little tired, to say the least, and I;m not sure anyone cares if he makes it out alive.I was disappointed that the movie had no elements of suspense, sans the dog hunt scene, and I left the theatre wondering if I had seen the right movie.Another gripe was the length. The story was too drawn out, and one has to reason if the writers really had a story to begin with (yes, I know it was a remake, but the other ones were definately better, and had some story to work with).Essentially, I was caught between figuring out the genre of the movie (drama or suspense or zombie thriller) and wondering when the hell it was going to end.",2,Not What I Expected (2.5 Stars),1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,1724,"['Overall', 'main', 'flaw', 'movie', 'was', 'story', 'execution', 'quite', 'possibly', 'biggest', 'thing', 'movie.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'cinematically', 'sweeping', 'landscapes', 'great', 'use', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'editing', 'camera', 'angles', 'movie', 'more', 'be', 'worth', 'anything.I', 'went', 'expecting', 'zombie', 'movie', 'partly', 'fault', 'movie', 'execs', 'how', 'advertised', 'movie', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'half-drama', 'half-suspense', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'Too', 'many', 'scenes', 'Smith', 'worrying', 'himbeing', 'last', 'man', 'earth', 'Where', 'Smith', 'usually', 'predictable', 'hero-esque', 'roles', 'here', 'scientist', 'who', 'experiment', 'wrong', 'acting', 'suits', 'story', 'not', 'desperation', 'fear', 'man', 'place', 'may', 'have', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Smith', 'best', 'acting', 'role', 'involved', 'dog', 'fod', 'hunt', 'gone', 'wrong', 'However', 'movie', 'worse', 'when', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'still', 'alive', 'However', 'time', 'move', 'audience', 'little', 'tired', 'say', 'least', 'not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'out', 'alive.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'had', 'elements', 'suspense', 'dog', 'hunt', 'scene', 'left', 'theatre', 'wondering', 'had', 'seen', 'right', 'movie.Another', 'gripe', 'was', 'length', 'story', 'was', 'too', 'drawn', 'out', 'one', 'reason', 'writers', 'really', 'had', 'story', 'begin', 'yes', 'know', 'was', 'remake', 'other', 'ones', 'were', 'definately', 'better', 'had', 'story', 'work', '.Essentially', 'was', 'caught', 'figuring', 'out', 'genre', 'movie', 'drama', 'suspense', 'zombie', 'thriller', 'wondering', 'when', 'hell', 'was', 'going', 'end']",I Am Legend

I thought the combination of the two would be a little bit of heaven.  The first half of the movie met, and exceeded, my expectations for a decimated world populated by feral humans, and Will Smith.  Exciting, with amazing visuals, and Will Smith's portrayal of the last man on Earth - Neville.  Torn by loneliness; racked by horror at the terrible turn his efforts to help humankind took; and survivor's guilt.  The efforts to live day to day, and the constant fear wearing away at Neville's humanity.  The first half of the movie is electric!  The last half of the movie is so bad, it seems that a different movie was tacked onto the end.SPOILERS----SPOILERS----SPOILERSThose infected with the virus are not shown until half way through the movie.  The director was wise to take the ""Jaws"" approach in not showing the antagonists, as their appearance is more cartoony than frightening.  The infected people have the energy level, and attitude, of an angry house cat, with the appearance of, well, hairless CG people.  The director always uses the startle factor to introduce the infected onto the screen.  Probably because the infected aren't particularly startling in, and of, themselves.  At least one of the infected show that they are capable of higher thought, through cunning and tool use, but for some reason - a) Neville does not seem to notice this fact, even though he is a victim of it; and b) the infected folks ability to do more than scream, run, and eat is abruptly dropped from the film, as though it had never happened.The human acting performances in the second half of the film go from 60 to zero in 10 seconds.  There is a lot of staring between the actors at this point.  Perhaps, they were emoting, but it came across as simply staring.  Lifeless.  Boring.  Kind of silly.  The movie finally ends (thank goodness) with a big unhappy (Boom!), and a big happy (Hurray.

I believe it is Will Smith's best role since ""Ali"" and shows that he has some serious acting talent, as he holds his own in the first 2/3rds of the movie as the only screen presence for the film (minus flashbacks) opposite only a dog as his only companion and friend.I thought it was phenomenally shot, and genuinely the scariest movie I've ever seen in my adult life.  Nothing I'd seen until then was genuinely frightening (and not just a cheap teen horror thrill with a loud sound and/or violin shriek) when Sam (Neville's dog) rushes after a deer into a pitch dark area, with only a gun-mounted flashlight, and absolutely no music playing whatsoever.Followed by another genuinely frightening scene, in which Fred (one of the mannequins Neville sets up outside a video store to talk to) has been moved (as part of a Darkseeker's trap), and nearly drives Neville insane, thinking Fred is perhaps a real person, and having to shoot him to be sure, only to spring the trap.As great as the movie was, and as frightening as it was, and as heartbreaking as it was to see the fate of his family and his dog, I spend about 18 dollars for the special edition two-disc version.And I spend double the price for the single disc for... maybe five minutes extra footage, tops?Disc one is basically the same thing you'd get in the normal edition; movie plus four animated comics.  Disc two gives you THE SAME MOVIE with maybe five minutes additional footage, such as some minor deleted scenes setting up the premise for the Darkseeker's evolution and intelligence, and the alternate ending, which while was a bit frightening and touching at once, was hardly groundbreaking and not at all controversial.Spoiler Alert: The ""alternate"" version of the movie just has a butterfly reference (the Darkseeker girl's tattoo), a scene with Neville showing Anna and Ethan the trap the Darkseeker Alpha set for him, a scene with Ethan swimming in a fish pond while Anna asks about the Darkseeker's evolution, and the alternate ending, in which rather than sacrifice himself, Neville turns over the girl to the Darkseeker, who shows he can truly love, and the Darkseekers leave them be to escape, with a cure to the virus in hand.So for used on Amazon you get the single disc version for.. 8 dollars or so.  For used two-disc, you get for 14 (as of this date), and before that I paid 18 including shipping.So as with the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix special edition, I got screwed; we all got screwed.Worthless.

The movie, which is set in 2009-2012, fails to entertain most of the time.After a doctor discovers the cure for cancer (2009), evertyhing seems to be right until some of the patients star dying out of this cure. The results?  99% of the population of Earth infected with only 1% of the whole world immune, if anything.Three years after the infection has taken place (2012), Robert Neville (Will Smith), is one of the only, if  not the only, survivor from this deadly virus, who is trying to find a cure for the ""cure"". Called the KV, this virus, does not kill the human, but it turns them in to what the movie describes as ""dark seekers"".The movie fails on evolving past anything. Not only does the movie take a while to develop, but the development if not clear enough.

Surely, the benefits of complete freedom would be overwhelmed by the appalling loneliness.  It must be like solitary confinement without the walls.  And solitary confinement has been known to send its victims mad.""I am Legend"" is a variance on the theme of the last man on earth.  Will Smith plays a modern day Robinson Crusoe alone within the decaying streets on Manhattan.  It is here that the film really is at its best.  The computer generated images of a ruined New York are remarkable.  There are weeds growing through the streets, deer roaming at will and even a pride of lions within this open air menagerie.It is Smith's role in life to both find other living humans as well as finding a cure for the virus that has seemingly destroyed the human race.  Smith plays this part brilliantly.  He is dedicated to his task while assisted by his trusty dog.  He is a determined man but one who is nearing the brink as he talks to shop mannequins and seems inordinately lonely.Around the half way point of the film, the viewer is introduced to some real objects of fear.  The virus that has wrought so much destruction on the human race has also led to the creation of a race of horrible mutants.  In this regard, I was reminded of HG Wells's ""The Time Machine"" where the Morlock live beneath the earth but come out at night to play on the peaceful Eloi.  With the use of modern cinematic techniques, these mutants can be made to be truly vile.The film's conclusion was not entirely expected.  Suffice to say that Smith plays a hero.  His role in the film is quite stunning.  Overall, I enjoyed this film.  It had moments that grabbed the viewer's attention.

656990,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JPTK,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 5]","When you look at `I Am Legend' you may initially shrug it off as nothing more than summer blockbuster popcorn fluff; just another horror film targeting today's youth and wasting our hard earned money.  You will most likely still go see it because, quite frankly, no one can resist Will Smith.  The film will start and you'll think that the depictions of New York, barren and desolate, are pretty creepy.  You'll see Smith driving a hundred miles an hour down the empty streets and you'll wish you could do that.  You'll see him hunting deer with his dog and it'll all seem pretty cool but what you won't realize is that you are slowly being drawn into the loneliness that is Robert Neville's existence.  You will watch his everyday life unfold and you'll find yourself feeling cold and distant and alone.  Before a single `vampire' appears on the screen you will be petrified.`I Am Legend' works so well because Will Smith is really that good in it.  Regardless of what anyone says, Will Smith is one excellent actor.  He's the type of actor that has everything you need to be successful.  He's attractive, he has charm and charisma; he's a riot in person and on film but he can also evoke very mature and stunning emotions that many wouldn't assign him.  In that respect he always proves himself a surprise to the viewer.  Here is no exception.  He elevates what could have been nothing more than a Hollywood monster movie into a serious and commanding look at loneliness and desperation.  In fact I'll be so blunt as to say that the best scenes in this film are when Will Smith is the only person on the screen, when he is alone and vulnerable; not when he is being pursued by the monsters.`I Am Legend' is the third revamping of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name.  It tells the story of Robert Neville, a scientist who happens to be the only survivor after an outbreak turns the world's population into walking zombies, or vampires.  He walks the streets of Manhattan during the daylight with his loyal German Shepherd Samantha and hides in his home at night while the creatures roam the streets looking for food.  During the day he attempts to live a life that is as normal as possible.  He sets up mannequins in video stores and carries on conversations with them.  He sticks to a schedule of exercise and meals and hunting.  He drives in his car and listens to Bob Marley and talks to his dog and pretty much does everything he can to stay sane.  He also broadcasts a message over the airwaves everyday looking for other survivors and he waits at the dock everyday at a specific time for them to arrive.The first half of `I Am Legend' plays out much better than the second because it's a slow build of human emotion.  Watching Smith's desperation grow across his face we are brought into his life and his situation and we feel his pain.  The second half, which introduces to us the creatures as well as another human survivor, steps a little bit away from the focus on Neville's loneliness and tries a little too hard to force fear on us by using the creatures.  This fear would have been much more rewarding had the creatures not looked so CGI animated.  They somewhat take away from the realness and rawness of the film when they look more like aliens then mutated humans.One thing that remains on point throughout though is Will Smith.  This may be one of his finest performances to date, seriously.  The emotion that he portrays his so real, so strong.  There is one scene in particular, where he breaks down crying in the video store as he begs for a female mannequin to talk to him, that got me all choked up.  His performance is so committed, so vital to the film that you can't help but give him props for delivering a very believable and very moving performance.In the end there are some things I would have changed here.  I would have hired actual actors for the roles of the `vampires' (although I hear that they had initially done that but felt that they looked too much like mimes) because I feel that the CGI was a little overdone.  I would have stuck a little closer to the book and eliminated the `other' survivor.  But there are too many things that I would have left alone; that work so well here that it seems silly to complain.

656991,A1HWXELXQEY17K,B00005JPTK,Andrew K Rawls,"[0, 1]","""I am Legend"" is one of the great science fiction films from the last 10 years.  It begins with a probable discovery and cure for cancer.  The film leads the viewer to believe that there is peace and hope in the world for once.  Imagine planet Earth as one big flowering utopia where world scientists have finally solved perhaps the greatest enigma since the genesis of mankind. Now flash forward three years later and the virus once thought to be the unexplained, supernatural  cure for a disease that infects 1 out of 3 people-genetically mutates and destroys the entire human race (or most of it as we shall see).  What's left of humanity are piled bodies or flesh eating zombies. The film follows ""The Last Man on Earth"", famed virologist, armed services lieutenant and sole survivor Robert Neville (Will Smith) on his final quest to save all of humankind.The film was beautifully scripted and an excellent adaptation of Matheson's 1954 horror novel of the same name.  The CGI and cinematography was simply brilliant and what a fantastic transfer Warner Brothers made onto Blu-ray. The editing was spot on and not a dull or unimportant moment went by that felt odd or unexplained.One of the scenes that haunts me the most is when Neville is forced to strangle his closest companion -a female German Shepherd- after she defends him against the flesh-eating undead.  At the time his latest tests are unsuccessful and there isn't a cure to save her. The scene closes with him crying and holding her in his arms in a chemical lab below his apartment. It was particularly emotional for me because at that point in the film the dog was the only friend he had.I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't had a chance to see it, but it ends beautifully and the viewer is left awestruck by what is left behind and what they have just witnessed.",5,A fantastic ride...,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,1842,"['am', 'Legend', 'one', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'last', '10', 'years', 'probable', 'discovery', 'cure', 'cancer', 'film', 'viewer', 'believe', 'peace', 'hope', 'world', 'once', 'Imagine', 'planet', 'Earth', 'one', 'big', 'flowering', 'utopia', 'where', 'world', 'scientists', 'have', 'finally', 'solved', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'enigma', 'genesis', 'mankind', 'Now', 'forward', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'virus', 'once', 'thought', 'be', 'unexplained', 'supernatural', 'cure', 'disease', '1', '3', 'people-genetically', 'mutates', 'entire', 'human', 'race', 'most', 'shall', 'see', 'What', 'left', 'humanity', 'are', 'piled', 'bodies', 'flesh', 'eating', 'zombies', 'film', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'famed', 'virologist', 'armed', 'services', 'lieutenant', 'sole', 'survivor', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'Will', 'Smith', 'final', 'quest', 'save', 'humankind.The', 'film', 'was', 'beautifully', 'scripted', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'Matheson', '1954', 'horror', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'CGI', 'cinematography', 'was', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'what', 'fantastic', 'transfer', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'made', 'Blu-ray', 'editing', 'was', 'spot', 'not', 'dull', 'unimportant', 'moment', 'went', 'felt', 'odd', 'unexplained.One', 'scenes', 'most', 'when', 'Neville', 'forced', 'strangle', 'closest', 'companion', '-a', 'female', 'German', 'Shepherd-', 'flesh-eating', 'undead', 'time', 'latest', 'tests', 'are', 'unsuccessful', ""n't"", 'cure', 'save', 'scene', 'crying', 'holding', 'arms', 'chemical', 'lab', 'apartment', 'was', 'particularly', 'emotional', 'point', 'film', 'dog', 'was', 'only', 'friend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'beautifully', 'viewer', 'left', 'awestruck', 'what', 'left', 'what', 'have', 'just', 'witnessed']",I Am Legend

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[0, 0]","Based on the book by Richard Matheson, I Am Legend is the story of Robert Neville (Will Smith), sole survivor of a plague that, originally, was supposed to be a miracle cure for cancer three years before. Instead, most of the world died at the hands of the plague. Others mutated into bloodthirsty vampiric creatures; only a small percentage of humankind remained immune to the disease.All alone in New York, virologist Neville tries to find a cure and ""fix"" the problem that stole the lives of everyone he knew and everyone he loved, while also trying to survive in a city infested with the infected and ferocious monsters.Straight from the start you know you're in for a ride.An empty city, overgrown and broken down.A lone guy speeding through the streets in a fancy car, weapon at his side.Animals prowling the streets, free of their cages.The lock up.The screams.The howls.Yeah, good stuff.The intense feeling of atmosphere was what drew me into this flick. Immediately isolation sets in right from the first frame as we see Neville trying to maintain a normal life in a dead city (renting movies, talking to mannequins, keeping a routine), his eyes washed with pain yet underscored with determination to keep on going. This is a one-man show and I haven't seen it done so well since Cast Away (one of my favorite movies) years and years ago.No complaints about Will Smith here and he's done a good job over his career to make you forget about the loud-mouthed homeboy he played in Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Plus, did you see the guy in this film? He's ripped! Shredded. But, I guess, you'd have to be if you lived a world where vampire-zombie-human things prowled the streets and your life could be in jeopardy at the drop of a hat if you weren't too careful.Which brings me to the monsters in question. Overall, well done. Creepy skin, no hair, loud growls, amazing agility and intensely vicious. Yeah, killer. Obviously they were CGI so they did look a tad rubbery and there were a few moments where it felt I was looking at a cartoon. Thankfully, those moments happened so fast and the action was so intense that I quickly forgot my quibble and moved on.My only thing was the ending. Now, I never read the book so I can't compare, but it ended too abruptly and really lost its post-apocalyptic feel in the last five minutes or so. Sort of a Disney ending, which didn't fit in with what was a gloomy story up until that point.Regardless, if someone asked me what I thought of this film, I'd tell them to go see it.It's that good.A.P.

The answer is yes. The movie kept me capitvated the entire hour and a half of it, I felt like it was timed perfectly, not too short, and not overly long either. This was one of those movies that you could feel, the fear of leaving your home on Christmas day because of a viral threat that is spreading is very scary, not to mention being the only person alive in the world for three years and counting. Will Smith deserves the Oscar for Best Actor, because it was hard not to sympathize with him, he had the eyes of Pacino in this film, you could just see the pain, fear, paranoia, etc. in his face, Just watch the part with his dog in his basement (I wont ruin the movie for those who didnt see it.). The symbolism in the movie is beautifully strewn through the film, most people dont even think enough to understand that in movies the scenes where it's kinda like ""why did the just show that?"" is connected to the story, which just makes it that much deeper, I.E. The scene where Will Smith is watching Shrek and he recites the lines of the donkey, which pretty much summed up his whole experience as the last survivor on earth, people who dont think (Americans)would'nt understand why that scene is even in the movie. I think Americans are so stupid and critical that they forgot what the purpose of a movie is, Which is entertainment. Watching this made me remember when movies were fun and exciting, when you could'nt wait to see what happend next, it was'nt anything like these hour long crap movies that hollywood bangs out so quickly. If you;re closed minded  you will most likely not like this movie, if you the opposite hey, you might like it.

She is being interviewed, and saying to the world that they have found a cure for cancer.Immediately, we flash to New York Citythree years later, It is literally DEAD.Foilage has grown up all the buildings, and the skyscrapers stand empty. The roads are cracked with weeds growing high through thier cracked surfaces. Empty cars are left abandoned, and wild deer run amok, over the cars and down the streets of a silent city.It has a very eerie feel to it.Will Smith is the only man left alive.He was immune to the virus that wiped out civilization.His German Shepard also survived the infection.When the infection hit, there were 6 billion people on earth. The virus had a 90% kill rate-That's 5.4 billion people dead.With less than a 1% immunity it left 12 million healthy people.( The other 580 million turned into the mutated creatures we see throughout the film0These creatures killed and fed off of the rest of the survivors, until there was no one left except Robert Neville (Will Smith's character)The creatures I mentioned are nocturnal, and ten times as ugly and violent as the infected on ""28 Days Later.""Andsince they ARE nocturnal, Will Smith can only do his hunting, gathering, and other chores (errands, DVD store etc,) during the day.He also sends out a broadcast on all AM frequencies,pleading that if there are any other survivors, to please contact him. He waits everyday at the same place also,hoping against all hope.The thing that amazed me most about this movie, was the EMPTY New York. I read that they emptied BLOCKS of the city to do the movie, because green screen, they felt, would just not have been effective enough. It gave the movie a very creepy quality they could not have acheived with green screen alone.The scare factor too was good( If you like to be scared, and I do :)  )When the infected chase him, for example, It KEEPS you jumping-THAT'S FOR SURE !!I won't say what happens because I don't want to ruin an excellent movie, but you will not be dissapointed. I am hoping that when this comes out on DVD, it has alternate endings, not that anything about this movie was BAD, but I would like to see it have gone in a different direction.There are many surprises, and you will want to talk about, and think about this movie long after it is over.I can't WAIT for it to come out on DVD, It is a definite must own for any DVD collection.Oh, and by the way, it does NOT follow the book.And that is a good thing, in my opinion.I bought the book after I saw the movie, and the two are NOTHING alike.Being that the book was written in the 1950's, the creatures were ""vampires.""- which they are NOT in the movie. Back then writers didn't have the imagination they do now. There were werewolves and vampires. period.I like how they modernized the story for the 2000's.Come to think about it, they WERE sort of like vampires.

657010,AG0TA24LI0XV7,B00005JPTK,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[4, 4]","(Spoilers involving the book ""I Am Legend"" lie ahead)There is something about post-apocalyptic tales and zombie horrors that fascinate us and draw us in.This is a taut and fairly suspenseful scifi/horror film that kept my attention. It is better than what I expected. When I learned that Hollywood was doing a film of my favorite vampire story (the third film version so far based on Richard Matheson's gripping novella), I winced and groaned. They'll ruin it, I thought. Well, the film is not bad. That being said, it's not excellent either.The digital zombies are just that. Digital-looking, if you get my meaning. Why do so many CGI monsters look unrealistic? I can't put my finger on it. Could be skin tones, or a certain lifelessness in the eyes, or the way they move? Hard to pinpoint. But these rabid monsters were cumbersome looking. They were loud and big, but not frightening enough for me. I felt half the time like I was watching a video game. The closeups especially were awful, reminding you that this face was created on a laptop by some guy with orange Cheese Doodle grit all over his fingers. And yet the zombie lab rats (and the zombie dogs in the city) were freaky scary. Go figure.There are some positive things about the movie. Silences instead of musical score accentuate the suspense; particularly in scenes such as when Robert Neville is looking for his dog Sam in some creepy, dark rooms. Incidental music would possibly have taken away from the feeling of dread in sequences like that. I liked the quiet. It was scary and tense.The movie doesn't become too much of a zombie flick; it remains more of a character study involving a man who has passed the edge of sanity but is fighting hard to crawl back. Will Smith is good, as usual. I don't think there's much he couldn't do as an actor.There's very little handheld, 'cinema verite' style camera work, I am happy to report. Lately a few horror movies are copying the visual style of The Blair Witch Project.There will be people who see this film and want to bury it in their back yard or hide it in the freezer along with Bambi, Charlotte's Web, and Old Yeller. I just hope they do not dismiss this film simply because it is realistic and sometimes sad. Those who have seen the movie know what I am referring to. I must confess that I had tears in my eyes at one point. Luckily the scene was handled very discreetly; but any way you do it, it's still heartbreaking.This is a loose interpretation of the book. People looking for a faithful adaptation will be sour after seeing this. After I read the book (many moons ago) I had it in my mind as a movie. It was so involving and scary. There was a scene in the book in which Robert Neville is driving home in the late afternoon and discovers that his wristwatch has stopped, and dusk is fast approaching. I was on the edge of my seat.

I have never been a huge Will Smith fan or a fan of science fiction which this film seemed to be.  Wow, was I shocked and amazed with the excellent, quality film of the highest caliber that totally took me by surprise.This film is so well made.  I thought the story was very well laid out.  The government thought that they had finally found a cure for cancer by using a vaccine for another illness.  After much use the treatment backfired with major side effects with the people turning into flesh eating zombies who could never be in the sun.  I didn't look at the creatures as mere vampire like beings but thought the deterioration due to the vaccine was well documented.  Back to the plot, New York City becomes quaurantined and Will Smith plays Neville, a military scientist who stays in New York to work on finding a cure.The barren and stranded New York City is amazing to view.  I was caught up in the film from the first second and amazed as I watched the small world Neville had created for himself and his dog which allowed him to work on the cure but also have protection from the creatures.  He ventured out every day and returned at night.  Will Smith has been praised for other films but his work here was truly Oscar worthy.  The first half of the film is the best when it is just him and the dog.  His characterization is more than believable as the lone survivor who deals with loneliness by talking to mannequins etc.  He has not gone crazy but has adapted.  I found the story to also be believable and the creatures when shown were also believable and very well created.  The movie has a serious basis but also has chills and thrills like one of the best horror films there are.In the latter half of the film the plot changes a little (I won't give it away) and the 5 star plus caliber of the first half gets a little off track.  It is still excellent but the first half was so superior it is hard to compete with.  The film has a purpose and shows Will Smith as never seen before.  Whatever your expectations for this film, upon viewing they will be far surpassed.

But can't we see a few more original films on the big screen rather than mulling over the same ones year after year? Is that asking too much? Perhaps it is.The post-apocalyptic science fiction genre has been done to death (The Last Man on Earth,Night of the Comet,Dawn of the Dead,28 Days Later,Outbreak,The Quiet Earth). And here in I AM LEGEND, we get a remake of the Charlton Heston filmThe Omega Man. Growing up, I loved The Omega Man. I often wondered what it'd be like to be the last man on Earth; at least the last ""normal"" man on Earth. The genre wasn't yet tired in 1971 and I wasn't even into my teens. But since then not-just-a-small-number of similar cinematic films have come out, bombarding movie watchers with the same ol' theme over and over and over again (see my partial list above).Will Smith (The Pursuit of Happyness) takes on the lead role as Dr. Robert Neville, the seemingly sole survivor of a plague that has wiped out 99% of humanity, turning the remaining 1% into cannibalistic zombie-vampires who burn up if exposed to sunlight; they roam New York's desolate streets at night in search of fresh meat. A cure for cancer has sparked a new virus that started humanity's die-off, and these scenes are given frequent flashbacks during the movie. We also get to see Dr. Neville's responsibility for trying to find a cure via the military (whom he works for before everyone keels over).With Dr. Neville is a trusty sidekick named Sam, a German Shepherd with acute senses. His canine abilities extend to detecting vampire-zombies, and to helping Neville battle the complete aloneness that rattles around his psyche. This is undoubtedly one of the strongest elements of the film. Watching Dr. Neville walk into a video rental store and speak to the mannequins he has set up is an honest portrayal that would hit any human who had only a dog to speak with.SPOILER ALERT!!!!When Sam-the-Dog dies (or rather when Dr. Neville is forced to kill him), it is a blow too deep and the good doctor goes out to meet up and kill as many of the nightstalkers as he can before they kill him. That's when he meets up with two young people (an older sister and younger brother) who save Neville from himself and tell him of a fantasy safe zone somewhere in the hills of Vermont. Neville has to decide what to believe in as the monsters close in on his home and threaten not only himself, but his two new god-fearing humans. The ending is pretty weak but set up nicely in a visual way.END SPOILER ALERT!!!Having hoisted such terrible news as ""unoriginal"" on I Am Legend, one cannot deny two key elements that make this film a positive experience. First is the extremely creepy feeling one gets when looking at a vacant New York City. The weeds growing up from cracks in the pavement. Wild deer migrating through empty car-riddled streets. Everywhere there's a vision of what once was human inhabitation and is now just a rotting shell. That was a painfully great set of scenes. Secondly is Will Smith. Similar to Tom Hanks'Cast Away, Smith carries the entire film and does so with effortless precision. The losses he experiences are tremendous, and Smith pulls us in and forces us to feel the pain of one man left alone for far too long. This is most evident when dealing with Sam-the-Dog and his encounters with a pretty mannequin that he starts to humanize in his mind.Some might be able to wiggle past this film's unoriginality factor, and if they can, I applaud them. They probably enjoyed the movie (minus the ending) much better than I was able.

The heart of the problem is an incomplete story. It's flawed in its addressing of the infected inhabitants, & in explaining the viral infection. He declares victims as having become completely devolved, w/no higher thought processes left intact. Then they're shown to adapt his own snare equipment in trying to capture him. Even the alternate film, which addresses this flaw somewhat, just doesn't add up. How did the virus go from Cancer cure, to global pathogen? What was the army's involvement? Weaponization?

I liked Anthony Zerbe's (THE OMEGA MAN) 'crazy' a tad better than the one here in I AM LEGEND, but this is still a decent movie.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: (A gentleman elsewhere was upset when I mentioned someone's death scene in KNOCKAROUND GUYS, and maybe he was right.

When the girl and her son decided to meet him at the dock, didn't she have any plans on where she was spending the night with the 'crazies' running loose?

This manmade horror kills the majority of what it infects and what it doesn't kill it turns into devolved humanoids that roam the streets at night and feed on the uninfected.Will we outsmart ourselves right into extinction? Will Smith plays Lt. Col.

657032,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JPTK,Caleb Williams,"[1, 2]","A lot of the negative reviews have pointed out that it's a terrible adaptation of the book by Richard Matheson, but I simply have to say that it's a standalone movie that takes the plot outline from the book and puts its own spin on things. On its own this film is a very emotional, intense, and at times quite a frightening movie that will have you thinking that this is possibly Will Smiths best performance to date.A cure for cancer is created from a genetically modified disease, but this cure turns into an infection of its own and soon spreads across the world killing most of the worlds population and turning the rest into mutated vampires which have fed on those last few survivors. Robert Neville is a former Army Lieutenant Colonel/Scientist who is forced to have his family taken away from him whilst he stays in the quarantined New York City looking for a cure to the mutated virus. His daughter hands him her dog, Sam before they take off in a helicopter. 3 years down the line and the human population of New York and possibly the world have died out and Robert is possibly the only human survivor. As he still battles to find a cure we are given an insight into how Robert copes with possibly being the only surviving human on Earth. He sets up mannequins in stores, pretends like their real people and interacts with them as if they were actually living. The Dog Sam is his only companion in the movie and we come to appreciate and love the relationship that develops between Robert and his Dog. One scene in particular that shows the intense emotion that this film reaches from time to time, is when Robert is cradling Sam in his arms after Sam is attacked by mutated dogs. Due to open wounds Sam is infected with the virus and Robert is forced to kill Sam. This, to me is a very upsetting scene and personally had me on the verge of tears, this shows the pure acting skill of Will Smith and proved to the critics that he was perfect for the role. The mutants in the film for the times that we see them are very intimidating and the chase scenes are quite intense and place you on the edge of your seat.Will Smith has always been one of those actors that a lot of people would doubt until they saw him in a movie or playing any particular role. I have to admit I had my doubts about him playing the last man on Earth and had my reservations about a film like this altogether as you would have to be prepared to sit through a movie with just the one human character on screen for the larger portion of the film and I had my reservations as to how this would play out altogether. Once putting the movie on, my doubts were simply put to rest as from the first scene Will Smith enraptures you in intrigue as you're shown how the man is hunting down his food in the form of a deer. The action sequences are intense and all scenes featuring the mutants are unbelievably frightening, even more than I thought they would be.This is a genuinely great movie and on Blu-Ray it's made much better with the alternate version parallel to the original cinematic version. This is a gem of a movie that I think all Will Smith fans will adore and even if you're not a fan of his previous work, this will make you want to see more.",5,Just Brilliant,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,3230,"['lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'terrible', 'adaptation', 'book', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'simply', 'have', 'say', 'standalone', 'movie', 'plot', 'outline', 'book', 'own', 'spin', 'things', 'own', 'film', 'very', 'emotional', 'intense', 'times', 'quite', 'frightening', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'possibly', 'Will', 'Smiths', 'best', 'performance', 'date.A', 'cure', 'cancer', 'created', 'genetically', 'modified', 'disease', 'cure', 'infection', 'own', 'soon', 'spreads', 'world', 'killing', 'most', 'worlds', 'population', 'turning', 'rest', 'mutated', 'vampires', 'have', 'fed', 'last', 'few', 'survivors', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'former', 'Army', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel/Scientist', 'who', 'forced', 'have', 'family', 'taken', 'away', 'whilst', 'quarantined', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'looking', 'cure', 'mutated', 'virus', 'daughter', 'dog', 'Sam', 'take', 'off', 'helicopter', '3', 'years', 'line', 'human', 'population', 'New', 'York', 'possibly', 'world', 'have', 'died', 'out', 'Robert', 'possibly', 'only', 'human', 'survivor', 'still', 'find', 'cure', 'are', 'given', 'insight', 'how', 'Robert', 'possibly', 'being', 'only', 'surviving', 'human', 'Earth', 'up', 'mannequins', 'stores', 'pretends', 'real', 'people', 'interacts', 'were', 'actually', 'living', 'Dog', 'Sam', 'only', 'companion', 'movie', 'come', 'appreciate', 'love', 'relationship', 'Robert', 'Dog', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'intense', 'emotion', 'film', 'time', 'time', 'when', 'Robert', 'cradling', 'Sam', 'arms', 'Sam', 'attacked', 'mutated', 'dogs', 'Due', 'open', 'wounds', 'Sam', 'infected', 'virus', 'Robert', 'forced', 'kill', 'Sam', 'very', 'upsetting', 'scene', 'personally', 'had', 'verge', 'tears', 'pure', 'acting', 'skill', 'Will', 'Smith', 'proved', 'critics', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'mutants', 'film', 'times', 'see', 'are', 'very', 'intimidating', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'intense', 'place', 'edge', 'seat.Will', 'Smith', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'actors', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'doubt', 'saw', 'movie', 'playing', 'particular', 'role', 'have', 'admit', 'had', 'doubts', 'playing', 'last', 'man', 'Earth', 'had', 'reservations', 'film', 'altogether', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'prepared', 'sit', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'human', 'character', 'screen', 'larger', 'portion', 'film', 'had', 'reservations', 'how', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'altogether', 'Once', 'putting', 'movie', 'doubts', 'were', 'simply', 'put', 'rest', 'first', 'scene', 'Will', 'Smith', 'intrigue', ""'re"", 'shown', 'how', 'man', 'hunting', 'down', 'food', 'form', 'deer', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'intense', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'mutants', 'are', 'unbelievably', 'frightening', 'even', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'be.This', 'genuinely', 'great', 'movie', 'Blu-Ray', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'alternate', 'version', 'parallel', 'original', 'cinematic', 'version', 'gem', 'movie', 'think', 'Will', 'Smith', 'fans', 'will', 'adore', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'previous', 'work', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'more']",I Am Legend

At least not in the Theatrical Version, the Alternate version has a happier ending. If you enjoyed the version with Charlton Heston you will probably like this version with Will Smith. One thing I have to agree with several reviews here is they should have used real humans for those infected as they did in the first movie. The CGI versions are a bit over the top and don't feel real. CGI is fine as long as it is mainly used for mattes and large creatures, but when you try to make humans with it, it seems almost like watching a cartoon. Only some ""Resident Evil"" computer gamers may think they are acceptable. It isn't that I don't like CGI, I thought ""Beowulf"" was quite well done. It just didn't work here. Sometimes makeup is far more effective. Personally I would have loved to seen the infected people and animals more realistic, in other words people and dogs with makeup, not CGI. The story premise is somewhat like the book, a virus wipes out mankind. Neville and a few other humans have survived.Neville believes everyone has now changed to the cannibalistic creatures that come out at night. His family is dead but he has a dog as a companion in this ""I Am Legend"" version. An interesting twist to how those changed, don't want changed and they are clever enough to even trap Neville. He keeps telling them he can fix this when in fact they don't desire it like he does. His dog is his best friend and probably the last thing that keeps him from going crazy with loneliness. His dog will sacrifice itself to save him inevitably. Neville will sacrifice himself for what is left of mankind as well when the time comes. Most of us would die for someone we love, so keeping that in mind it is a little easier to take the trajedy when it comes. Until then he and his dog hold up at night in his fortress like apartment and come out to scout the city for food, DVDs, and the location of infected colonies during the day. Chasing deer in a Shelby Mustang is one of the few thrills left to him. He must be home by dusk and make sure the Zombies don't follow him if he hopes to survive.I enjoyed the movie and Bob Marley music and I think it has good replayability. Good quality DVD with animated shorts on the basic single disc, and commentarty, interviews, and much more on the two disc version.The Blu-ray version is excellent and has excellent quality picture and sound.

I never read it and please do not come here babbling on about how the novel was better. It probably was.Anyone who frequents zombie films and who is also not looking for Shakespeare at the same time will tell you as I will that 28 Days Later and 30 Days of Night are pretty much as good as it gets. Sure the old favorites are great and the new Dawn of the Dead is good too. We who enjoy such films are not used to well written scripts, above average performances, and poignant scenes with good dialogue. We are also not used to seeing too much emotion and certainly not used to seeing any thing too symbolic or even religious. For all these things are usually not in low budget zombie films. This film had some of these things in different quantities. Will Smith was good too.I lost myself in this film. I was there on the streets on NYC as a secret observer. It was suspenseful for me as a result of this. Was it perfect? No. Was it better than average as far as films about zombies go? Yes. Was it unique as far as films about zombies go? Pretty much.What did the film have that bothered me? Well for starters it had a leader zombie. Zombies do not have leaders. At least in my mind they do not. I also felt the whole sunlight vampire thing was not needed. Simply having them be nocturnal would have been fine. Raccoons are nocturnal and I have rarely seen them in daylight. Films like these suffer from too much explanation. The less that is said and the more that is implied or alluded to the better. It helps activate minds and let creative people wonder. This breeds discussion and speculation. Films like this that are done well and go easy on exposition usually stand the test of time. 2001 comes to mind as well as the Shining. When we are dealing with something we have never seen before, something that is complete fiction, less is always more.

Will Smith portrays a scientist who was responsible for finding a cure to a virus that had spread throughout the world.  This virus turned people (and animals) into a type of Zombie/Vampire. Unfortunately the good doctor didn't find the cure and civilization was pretty much destroyed.  I love that they showed a typical day in the life of this doctor. While the movie is packed with action created by the zombie/vampires, it takes the time to show how he survives from day to day. His existence is better than most survivors that are portrayed in these types of movies until an event occurs which throws him into a careless rage bringing his carefully crafted existence into dire jeopardy. I also love the zombie/vampire creatures.  They are quick, incredibly scary looking and intelligent.  They are the scariest virus victims of any movie that I've ever seen. I truly hope if anything like this ever occurs in real life that the monsters are nothing like the ones depicted in this film!

The premise is similar, but I won't repeat the plot here, for it has been summarized well by others. What I don't really understand is why this film was made now. After 28 Days Later, I am Legend appears to be a remake that uses CGI zombies instead of real people with camera effects.But there are two things that make this movie worth it: Will Smith and his character's development. He's good. In fact, he's exceptional. ForgetThe Pursuit of Happyness (Full Screen Edition). Smith shines in this film, and it's partly because of the writing.

Attempts to destroy it fail, but an uneasy detente is reached by the end. I Am Legend is a fascinating instantiation of this theme, saved from being a takeoff on 28 Days Later by its deep exploration of loneliness and humanness.The genetically engineered virus that cured cancer mutated into something that deprived its victims of their skin pigmentation and their ability to control their survival impulses. Those that survive its 90% kill rate turn into dark-seekers, creatures whose skin burns at the touch of light, and whose carnivorous urges compel them to feed on any living animal, including humans. But some intelligence remains; they can set traps, act in coordinated fashion while hunting, train infected dogs to assist them in the kill, catch the eye of a man standing in the sunlight and give a look that says, ""you win this one, but wait until dark."" We are brought to wishing that they didn't have minds any longer, so hideous their existence, but they do have minds, and the thought of being one of those millions who didn't die is worse than death.Just one percent of the human population is immune to this virus, and one of them is Robert Neville [Will Smith], an Army virologist who finds himself at the epicenter of the outbreak, Long Island. He has no reason to go on. His family was killed trying to evacuate the Island; he broadcasts a call to any other unaffected human and waits every day on the pier at midday for those who hear it to come to him. But no one ever does. But Robert has a will to survive, and that will must be given some purpose, so he constructs a basement lab and continues the search for a cure, accompanied only by his dog, Samantha.I Am Legend is far from perfect. It is, after all, yet another good-scientist-does-evil-by-unleashing-a-virus-that-creates-cannibalistic-humans flick. But it is also about sanity, the human need to have purpose and companionship, the scientist who finds that he also needs faith.

Being the last man on earth and perhaps the only person who could find a cure for the many infected humans (aka fast zombies) is a huge burden for the good doctor, who has settled into a bit of routine of trying to gather supplies, capture test subjects, and practicing his golf long game.A lot of the story is told through flashback and there are truly some moving scenes that add to the drama and provide insight to the deteriorating mindset of Dr. Neville. The action is fairly evenly paced, with some heart pounding moments scattered throughout. The special effects range from cheesy to very good, but hold up when needed.This movie does a great job of setting the mood of the isolation and fear that Dr. Neville experiences and is a quite watchable horror flick...

The scene where he reluctantly followed his dog into the shadowed building that housed the infected humans were frightening.Everything was going so well... and when Neville used a trap to capture one of the infected and then the infected turned the tables on him, instituting their own trap, I was sold. That was followed by some heart-wrenching moments and a confrontation scene that was creative and realistic. I AM LEGEND was right on. A memorable, hit movie. And then....I AM LEGEND became just another movie. There were characters introduced that broke the movies rhythm. Anna & Ethan? They're clean. Calm. They appear out of nowhere, but have no knowledge of what happens after dark. She manages to save Neville from an onslaught of infected, but then shows no sign of being battle or survival tough.There are moments where the audience isn't allowed to play along, like when the infected find Neville's hideout. It is explained by a single line of dialogue and has little to zero impact.Ultimately though, I AM LEGEND started off unique and just became forgettable and uneventful. When a premise has been done hundreds of times, it's time for a shakeup... something new... we didn't get it with I AM LEGEND. We got 1 hour of unique moments followed by 40 minutes of the same old same old.",3,Expected MORE,1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,2284,"['*SPOILERS*I', 'was', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'completely', 'way', 'revilation', 'scene', 'when', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'Will', 'Smith', 'out', ""n't"", 'alone', 'quite', 'frankly', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'fell', 'completely', 'table', 'crashed', 'million', 'pieces.I', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'had', 'premise', ""'ve"", 'scene', 'hundreds', 'times', 'OMEGA', 'MAN', '28', 'DAYS', 'LATER', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'out', 'dark', 'Zombies', 'forms', 'thereof', 'only', 'survivor', 'incredible', 'catastrophe', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'different', 'When', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'cool', 'direction', 'were', 'seeing', 'something', 'completely', 'new', 'completely', 'original', 'twist', 'otherwise', 'overused', 'premise', 'realized', 'nope', 'same', 'old', 'stuff', 'Nothing', 'remembering.The', 'scenes', 'Will', 'Smith', 'racing', 'baron', 'littered', 'grass', 'covered', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'hunting', 'deer', 'avoiding', 'Lions', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'scenes', 'using', 'video', 'store', 'social', 'outlet', 'strategically', 'placed', 'mannequins', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'poigniant', 'scene', 'where', 'reluctantly', 'followed', 'dog', 'shadowed', 'building', 'housed', 'infected', 'humans', 'were', 'frightening.Everything', 'was', 'going', 'so', 'well', 'when', 'Neville', 'used', 'trap', 'capture', 'one', 'infected', 'then', 'infected', 'turned', 'tables', 'instituting', 'own', 'trap', 'was', 'sold', 'was', 'followed', 'heart-wrenching', 'moments', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'was', 'creative', 'realistic', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'was', 'right', 'memorable', 'hit', 'movie', 'then', '.I', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'became', 'just', 'movie', 'were', 'characters', 'introduced', 'broke', 'movies', 'rhythm', 'Anna', 'Ethan', ""'re"", 'clean', 'Calm', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'have', 'knowledge', 'what', 'dark', 'save', 'Neville', 'onslaught', 'infected', 'then', 'sign', 'being', 'battle', 'survival', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'audience', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'play', 'along', 'when', 'infected', 'find', 'Neville', 'hideout', 'explained', 'single', 'line', 'dialogue', 'little', 'zero', 'impact.Ultimately', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'started', 'off', 'unique', 'just', 'became', 'forgettable', 'uneventful', 'When', 'premise', 'been', 'done', 'hundreds', 'times', 'time', 'shakeup', 'something', 'new', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'got', '1', 'hour', 'unique', 'moments', 'followed', '40', 'minutes', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old']",I Am Legend
657046,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPTK,Chris Pandolfi,"[10, 12]","We've seen a lot of films that take place in a post apocalyptic future, and of those films, many open by telling us that government, civilization, and humanity in general collapsed because of a viral outbreak. This plot device is used once again in ""I Am Legend,"" a science fiction thriller that would be far less impressive if an epidemic was all that the plot had to go on. In all honesty, the plot isn't all that interesting or original; this is the fourth film adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel, the first three being 1964's ""The Last Man on Earth,"" 1971's ""The Omega Man,"" and 2007's direct to video ""I Am Omega."" For this newest adaptation, the casting of Will Smith is what made it work, especially since he had to act by himself for most of the film. He plays an intelligent, driven, and desperate character, a man whose isolating circumstances have driven him to emotional extremes. Some extremes almost come off as funny, in a pathetic sort of way.Yes, I can praise Smith a great deal for this role. The story, on the other hand, is generally entertaining but not entirely successful, especially as it nears the end; at that point, it relies too much on the clich&eacute;s of hope, loss, and redemption in the midst of frightening special effects. This isn't to say that the film doesn't work altogether--the first three-quarters of ""I Am Legend"" are surprisingly strong, not only because of Smith's performance, but also because of the way it builds tension. The story functions under the premise of a cure for cancer that was introduced in 2009, only to mutate into an infection. By the year 2012, ninety percent of the planet's population is dead. Of the remaining ten percent, less than one percent is immune to the virus--everyone else has been transformed into a vampire-like flesh eater. Nothing is ever mentioned about garlic or wooden stakes, but it is known that exposure to sunlight is fatal for these things.This is the horrible future in which we find Robert Neville (Smith), a sole-surviving military scientist who struggles to exist in an empty, decimated New York City. When he's not gathering basic supplies, hunting loose herds of deer with his beloved dog, Sam, or protecting himself from hordes of mutant vampires, he's trying to discover a cure in a makeshift lab in his basement. Because he's immune, his blood serves as a possible way to produce a cure. The ironic implications of that are too clever to overlook: Blood may in fact be the key to ridding the infected of their thirst for blood. But irony is not what this film is about; at its heart, ""I Am Legend"" is about loneliness, guilt, and paranoia, all of which come into perspective during flashback sequences involving Neville and his family. Piece by piece, the fates of his wife, Zoe (Salli Richardson), and daughter, Marley (Willow Smith), are revealed, as are the facts of how Manhattan Island was quarantined.Neville's memories are second only to his emotional well-being, which is barely hanging on by a thread. He tries to maintain his sanity by (1) keeping a video diary of his scientific research, and (2) sending out a radio message to anyone who might be alive and in need of shelter. But his sanity may be slipping. Early on, he enters a video store that not only has a fine selection of DVDs, but also a number of strategically placed mannequins. He speaks to them as if they were real people. He also avoids some out of nervousness; he just can't bring himself to strike up a conversation with the pretty female mannequin in back of the store. Here's a scene that appears light-hearted and funny but is actually quite serious. Simply put, loneliness can make a person do some strange things. And consider the moment he returns to the video store--he finally does approach the female mannequin to say, ""I promised my friend I'd say hello to you. Hello."" Now with tears in his eyes, he says, ""Please say hello to me. Please. Say hello to me.""This is the kind of depth that can mean the difference between a compelling film and an unimaginative rehash. Most of ""I Am Legend"" is a well-structured character study, highlighted by palpable levels of suspense, drama, and fright. It isn't until the final twenty minutes that the film loses some steam, turning a fascinating story into a run of the mill creature feature. It begins with the introduction of two immune humans: a young woman named Anna (Alice Braga) and a boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan). Anna believes that a survivor's colony exists, not because she's actually seen it, but because God told her so. This, of course, brings out the worst in Neville, who has not only lost his faith, but also his willingness to leave New York--""This is Ground Zero,"" he says. ""I can fix this."" Despite his daily radio message, his years of isolation have left him unable to interact with other people, least of all with Anna.And that's when the vampire mutants attack, infiltrating Neville's fortress/house in a final showdown. I obviously can't say how everything ends, but I can say that it isn't all that surprising given the kind of movie this wants to be. I won't go so far as to say that the ending doesn't work, but I do think it could have worked better, especially since the rest of the film was so much more effective. For the most part, ""I Am Legend"" is an above average thriller, with a tense opening that quietly plays itself out. I'm recommending this movie despite some structural and narrative flaws; on the whole, it's still an engaging, taut, emotionally charged thriller, one of the better ones of recent memory.",4,Last Man

McVay ""Writer""","[3, 4]","This intense Sci-Fi/horror is what I call 'smart' sci-fi because it gets us emotionally attached to the characters 'before' anything shows up to attack or eat them, that way we really care if something happens. I recently saw a movie (won't mention the name) where the characters were so annoying I was cheering for the monster. I Am Legend is a high caliber movie in its genre and I've always thought Will Smith gives one hundred percent to all the roles he plays. This tale is a cautionary warning of how we humans can really mess up. A virus developed as a hopeful cure to cancer becomes a deadly infection that turns humans into hideous beings that hover in the dark, unable to live in the sunlight. Very few people are immune to it and the city of New York is closed off. Will Smith plays a doctor who dedicates the remainder of his life to try and find a cure, lonely and left only with his dog, our hearts ache for him. I must say the creatures were truly creepy.  They didn't go overboard on the effects, it's the subtle approach that makes them extremely horrid and too realistic looking. I always crave the truly happy ending, but what can I say, this film met me half-way in that area. Maybe some of us need to get over our happy ending cravings.Chrissy K.

657048,AT2L9P49VHVY5,B00005JPTK,Christopher R,"[1, 2]","After seeing this film in theaters I went out and purchased the novella upon which it is based.  While I was fascinated by the film, the book is far superior.  Rather than being a family man and scientist attempting to cure the virus, Neville is an ordinary man who takes it upon himself to kill as many of the infected as possible.  Ultimately he realizes that the creatures he hunts are not necessarily evil, but that there has been a paradigm shift:  humanity has ""evolved"" and he is the evil ""legend"" unmercifully killing those that are normal.  I found that version more compelling as the Neville portrayed there more closely resembles what I believe to be the average American male.  Also, that version of the story is significantly more intellectually intriguing.While the alternate version contained in the DVD/HD DVD/Blu-ray version is different in several ways from the book, in ways that I will not mention so as not to spoil the book for those who have not yet read it, I think that it contains that intriguing paradigm shift theme around which Matheson based his story.  Obviously Hollywood is going to take creative license with a film in their adaptation, but if they would have instead released this ""alternate version"" in theaters I think that they would have had a more successful film as it would have well adapted the story to make it more exciting while retaining the intellectual elements.

It's one of those stories that seems ripe for re-interpretations and such a simple idea can bring with it a number of tries to get the story going. This version is probably one of the better ones but it's not perfect by any means and it's either the closest we'll get to a great adaptation or it's just not the right approach.Robert Neville is a military scientist trying to find the cure for a virus that wiped out nearly the entire world's population. Living in New York with his dog Sam, Robert spends his day renting videos in alphabetical order, chatting to mannequins he's set up and waiting at a pier in case people who hear his broadcast show up. But when the watch's alarm goes up, he heads back home before the sun goes down as strange sounds and creatures come out at night, leaving him to fend for himself while he tries to find a cure.The first hour or so is one of the more well executed parts in the entire film and you're on your way thinking this is going to be a great movie. But then Neville turns out to not be entirely alone and the film kind of dips into ""eh"" quality. The screenwriters (one being Akiva Goldsman who's responsible for the unholy mess that is Batman and Robin) manage to keep our interest entirely by showing the various ways you can keep busy in a desolated New York. It changes a couple of elements from the book that work a bit better and thanks to the visuals which show vegetation growing out of the pavement, cars all over the streets and even wildlife showing up now and then it becomes impressive how well it's keeping our attention.It's the last act which falls apart as it's not a bad idea storywise it's just handled improperly and starts with a couple scenes, involving Shrek and Bob Marley that fall completely on their face and they're just strange. Then of course there's the look of the creatures which, instead of taking the ""guy in costume"" approach, they're entirely computer-generated and they look so bad and practically PC quality that it's distracting.Best thing easily about the movie is Will Smith who shows what a lot of people knew all along: he's an incredibly charismatic and likable actor that makes it hard not to want to watch him. But being the only actor for a large chunk of the film was a feat some were curious about and he doesn't just ham it up either and gives an emotionally charged performance that shows he can act and films like Ali or the Pursuit of Happyness are not his only forum for breaking his ""Fresh Prince"" persona, usually seen in the blockbusters.Since it's probably the biggest DVD/Blu-Ray release this week, I'd have to recommend the film since everyone will want to see it but I'm not sure how many will enjoy it.",4,3.5; The world as a playground...,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,2912,"['Interestingly', '2', 'adaptations', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'book', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'Omega', 'Man', 'showcasing', 'same', 'kind', 'premise', 'supreme', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'one', 'stories', 'ripe', 're-interpretations', 'simple', 'idea', 'can', 'bring', 'number', 'tries', 'get', 'story', 'going', 'version', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'not', 'perfect', 'means', 'closest', ""'ll"", 'get', 'great', 'adaptation', 'just', 'not', 'right', 'approach.Robert', 'Neville', 'military', 'scientist', 'trying', 'find', 'cure', 'virus', 'wiped', 'out', 'nearly', 'entire', 'world', 'population', 'Living', 'New', 'York', 'dog', 'Sam', 'Robert', 'day', 'renting', 'videos', 'alphabetical', 'order', 'chatting', 'mannequins', 'set', 'up', 'waiting', 'pier', 'case', 'people', 'who', 'hear', 'broadcast', 'show', 'up', 'when', 'watch', 'alarm', 'up', 'back', 'home', 'sun', 'down', 'as', 'strange', 'sounds', 'creatures', 'come', 'out', 'night', 'leaving', 'fend', 'find', 'cure.The', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'one', 'more', 'well', 'executed', 'parts', 'entire', 'film', ""'re"", 'way', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'then', 'Neville', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'alone', 'film', 'kind', 'dips', 'eh', 'quality', 'screenwriters', 'one', 'being', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'who', 'responsible', 'unholy', 'mess', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'manage', 'keep', 'interest', 'entirely', 'showing', 'various', 'ways', 'can', 'keep', 'busy', 'desolated', 'New', 'York', 'couple', 'elements', 'book', 'work', 'bit', 'better', 'thanks', 'visuals', 'show', 'vegetation', 'growing', 'pavement', 'cars', 'streets', 'even', 'wildlife', 'showing', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'impressive', 'how', 'well', 'keeping', 'attention.It', 'last', 'act', 'apart', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'storywise', 'just', 'handled', 'improperly', 'couple', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Shrek', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'fall', 'completely', 'face', ""'re"", 'just', 'strange', 'Then', 'course', 'look', 'creatures', 'instead', 'taking', 'guy', 'costume', 'approach', ""'re"", 'entirely', 'computer-generated', 'look', 'so', 'bad', 'practically', 'PC', 'quality', 'distracting.Best', 'thing', 'easily', 'movie', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'what', 'lot', 'people', 'knew', 'along', 'incredibly', 'charismatic', 'likable', 'actor', 'hard', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'being', 'only', 'actor', 'large', 'chunk', 'film', 'was', 'feat', 'were', 'curious', ""n't"", 'just', 'ham', 'up', 'either', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'performance', 'can', 'act', 'films', 'Ali', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'forum', 'breaking', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'persona', 'usually', 'seen', 'blockbusters.Since', 'probably', 'biggest', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'release', 'week', ""'d"", 'have', 'recommend', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'want', 'see', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'will', 'enjoy']",I Am Legend
657053,A3QB2VPGHT0SVC,B00005JPTK,"C. Monk ""CM""","[0, 2]","I read Matheson's ""I am Legend"" just a few years ago and I loved it.  I had read ""Hell House"" and I was just so amazed at the wide scope he could take in the horror genre.When I heard they were making or re-making ""I am Legend"" I was really excited.  When I read that they were having it take place in New York I become a little suspicious as the book takes place in L.A.  What other changes would they make to the original story?Well it turns out the New York setting worked quite well.  Seeing Will Smith hunting deer on Broadway or driving down the empty streets of America's most populated city had a great dramatic effect.Much of the original book was changed however, some for better and some for the worse.  Most notably was the ending.As others have pointed out, the first half of the film is just so powerful, packed with the shock of seeing what the world has become after this vampire virus spreads as well as the emotional plot turns.The second half of the film seemed somewhat rushed to me.  Now I have no way of knowing in what order they shot the scenes but I felt that maybe the writing could have been better for the second half of the film.  For instance, and this may be a slight spoiler, the scene at the pier at night, I thought it would have worked perfectly if they had stuck more to the book and had the ""civilized"" vampires rescue him from the other vampires like in the book instead of how they did it in the movie.  But that's another part of the book they left out entirely; the different classes of vampires that sprang up.  Yes I know that Matheson never actually calls them vampires but we all know that's what they are.Overall, this is a good film and I intend to actually buy it when it comes out on DVD.  There are few apocalyptic stories that I think pull it off and this is one of them.  The visual effects for the transformed New York are stunning though the vampire creatures could have been better.Will Smith proves in this film that he's not just an actor who is suited for comedy or light drama.  His role in this is somewhat similar to ""I, Robot"" though so much of the film depends on him and he pulls it off quite well.",4,Not as good as expected but good nonetheless,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,2162,"['read', 'Matheson', 'am', 'Legend', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'loved', 'had', 'read', 'Hell', 'House', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'amazed', 'wide', 'scope', 'could', 'take', 'horror', 'genre.When', 'heard', 'were', 'making', 're-making', 'am', 'Legend', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'When', 'read', 'were', 'having', 'take', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'become', 'little', 'suspicious', 'book', 'place', 'L.A.', 'What', 'other', 'changes', 'would', 'make', 'original', 'story', 'Well', 'out', 'New', 'York', 'setting', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'Seeing', 'Will', 'Smith', 'hunting', 'deer', 'Broadway', 'driving', 'down', 'empty', 'streets', 'America', 'most', 'populated', 'city', 'had', 'great', 'dramatic', 'effect.Much', 'original', 'book', 'was', 'changed', 'however', 'better', 'worse', 'Most', 'notably', 'was', 'ending.As', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'powerful', 'packed', 'shock', 'seeing', 'what', 'world', 'become', 'vampire', 'virus', 'spreads', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'plot', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'rushed', 'Now', 'have', 'way', 'knowing', 'what', 'order', 'shot', 'scenes', 'felt', 'maybe', 'writing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'instance', 'may', 'be', 'slight', 'spoiler', 'scene', 'pier', 'night', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'had', 'stuck', 'more', 'book', 'had', 'civilized', 'vampires', 'rescue', 'other', 'vampires', 'book', 'instead', 'how', 'did', 'movie', 'part', 'book', 'left', 'out', 'entirely', 'different', 'classes', 'vampires', 'sprang', 'up', 'Yes', 'know', 'Matheson', 'never', 'actually', 'vampires', 'know', 'what', 'are.Overall', 'good', 'film', 'intend', 'actually', 'buy', 'when', 'out', 'DVD', 'are', 'few', 'apocalyptic', 'stories', 'think', 'off', 'one', 'visual', 'effects', 'transformed', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'stunning', 'vampire', 'creatures', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.Will', 'Smith', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'actor', 'who', 'suited', 'comedy', 'light', 'drama', 'role', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'Robot', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'off', 'quite', 'well']",I Am Legend

The hour-and-a-half goes by pretty fast, and gets you into the plight of the main character, so I give it four stars for that.I can't say the story is anything special, or particularly intelligent. The theme of few people left on the planet, a kind of ""Planet Of The Ape"" type tale, is nothing new. This one just has a few different twists to it and, film-wise, is different in that it features computerized special-effects. As one who normally enjoys those visual treats, I would rate this aspect ""fair,"" too, like the story.Early on, the animals racing down New York City streets looked very fake. Later, the effects were a little better with the zombies, but nothing that would make you drop your jaw in amazement.Like the story and FX, Will Smith as the lead character was okay: good, but not Oscar material.

657059,A364W6U6YL219D,B00005JPTK,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[1, 1]","I Am Legend (2007) Will Smith stars in this third movie version of Richard Matheson's classic 1954 science fiction novel. Will plays Robert Neville, here an Army colonel/scientific researcher stuck in a world decimated by a virus that was created to cure cancer. Although he is the last man on earth, he is not alone in the world. He spends his days working on a cure for the virus, and his nights locked away in a secret fortress, hiding from what mankind has become: crazed vampiric creatures with little resemblance to their former human existences. Neville's only companion is his faithful dog Sam. Three years after the outbreak they live in New York City, with plant life and herds of wild deer beginning to encroach on what was once man's domain. Based on Men in Black and Independence Day, Will Smith + Science Fiction = Big Budget Entertainment with Lots of Effects and Hilarious Wisecracks. This time, an actor wanting to stretch himself and a more downbeat story means no wisecracks. As a result, this is an impressively mounted movie with a very good central performance, but the lack of interaction and rather dour proceedings keep this one from scoring a bullseye. The two previous versions of the story (including The Last Man on Earth (1964) with Vincent Price and The Omega Man (1971) with Charlton Heston) have their moments and are worth a watch for those so inclined, with Last Man scoring highest as an adaptation of the novel since it sticks closest to it. It is mainly hampered by a budget too small for its ambitions and being made in English by Italians. The Omega Man is fun in the way only science fiction action movies from this period starring Charlton Heston can be. This third version has all the CGI visuals money can buy but changes Matheson's story a lot (too much?) and has a tacked on ""moviemaking-by-committee"" finale that doesn't work very well. The film's original ending wouldn't have been much better, still differing from the novel's a lot. A combination of the two would have been the best bet but until Hollywood decides to release a series of ""Craig Edwards Cut"" DVD's you'll have to ask me what that would have been.

Will Smith earned his paycheck here more convincingly as a soldier than as a scientist, but on the other hand the mutants he battled were one of the neater CGI foes to come along in a monk's age. I Am Legend hasn't lingered in my mind the way a truly good movie will but I recall being pleased enough when I first saw its story of one man and his loyal dog surviving in a disquietingly vacant post-epidemic Manhattan. So, your call here. If you like Will Smith movies, grim futures, recumbent humanity and cannibalistic mutants-cum-monsters, you'll probably enjoy I Am Legend.

657069,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00005JPTK,DanD,"[3, 3]","I am going to start with a disclaimer, aimed towards fans of Matheson's book: This is not what you would call a ""faithful"" adaptation.  Matheson's novel was more of a social commentary (as was most of his work, including his several ""Twilight Zone"" episodes and movie screenplays), with an ending that left readers no doubt that he was reaching beyond the realm of science fiction and horror.  This movie...not so much.The film must be judged on its own merits.  Fortunately, it holds up.  I was skeptical--as soon as I heard they were putting Will Smith in a production of ""I Am Legend,"" I balked.  Vincent Price pulled it off in ""The Last Man on Earth;"" I've never seen the Charlton Heston version (""The Omega Man""), so I can't judge it.  But Will Smith?  Don't get me wrong, he's a great action hero.  But this isn't--or, rather, wasn't--an action story.  So...again...Will Smith?Well, he pulls it off.  He probably could even have pulled off a faithful adaptation; the first half shows so much potential, I think he could've gone all the way.  As is, as soon as the cheesy computer-animated monsters come in, it becomes something more of a shoot-em-up.  In fact, I'm willing to bet you that there are two good reasons for watching this movie: the scenery (my God, it'll take your breath away), and Will Smith.  Well, also the dog.  And, if you've heard about the scene that's not good for dog lovers...well, you're right.  I didn't think it would shake me much, but it did.  Kudos to the film-makers; that's probably the one scene in here that SHOULD'VE been in the Matheson novel.So, for those doubters out there, I suggest watching the film.  If you're a Richard Matheson fan, go into it with a grain or two of salt, please, and judge the film on its own merits.  It still isn't a GREAT movie, no; it could've been, I think, had they stuck to the novel.  They digressed, however, and what we have here is a slightly-better-than-average popcorn flick, with vampire/zombie hybrid things.

Bob Marley believed that music and love could change and heal the world. He was a true visionary, and I'm so very glad his very important message has not been forgotten by Hollywood!

Over the years I have watched it about a dozen times. I never tire of it! This remake pays homage to the original. But it's a very, very different interpretation.

The first half, I was pleasantly surprised to discover, is very good indeed and doesn't concede to the big guns, explosions and one-liner forumula popularised by the Bruckheimer and Simpson school of Blockbuster movie-making; In keeping with the novel, what you have is the laconic introduction of a man going about an ordered routine in a world in which order has ceased to have meaning. The first section of the film, prior to the first appearance of the living human infected (and minus some dodgy CGI deer and a CGI lion that looked like it had padded into frame from the film,Madagascar (Widescreen Edition)) is nothing short of breathtaking. The vistas of an empty New York slowly returning to nature are the best CGI that I've seen sinceChildren of Men (Widescreen Edition)largely because, bar the opening shots, they borrow a trick from that film in not dwelling on the landscapes with the obligatory ""look at our cool effects, kids!"" shots. Because of the ordinariness with which they're treated one doesn't relate to them as an effect.  Smith's performance as Bob Neville is, thank the lord, note perfect. The unspoken dread in his eyes as he's washing his canine companion in the bath-tub and waiting for the sun to set is palpable and, I take my hat off to him, he deserves an Oscar for the strength and subtlety of his performance here. Films like this are carried by their actors and this is a spectacular performance. Not the best of its kind - that accolade still goes to the late, great Bruno Lawrence in the brilliantThe Quiet Earth- but certainly in the top five. However, the scene which is the film's greatest triumph is also its greatest tragedy. Namely, when Neville is forced to chase his dog into a darkened building and we're treated to a bravura sequence in which he unequivocally panics as he tracks around darkened corners with his rifle. We, the audience, know that the human infected - whom we still haven't seen - are going to jump out on him. And they do. And when they do, they are unfortunately completely unconvincing as anything other than a special effect - and not a particularly convincing special effect at that - at which that point all of the carefully accrued tension dissipates and the audience finds itself firmly in rubbery Matrix CGI country. Make no mistake about it, if Francis Lawrence had opted for human performers in make-up (of the like seen in28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)and Zack Snyder's superbDawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)remake) rather than CGI, it would have probably have been the most terrifying piece of big-budget horror film-making in recent history. In fact, one wonders whether the budget wasn't the deciding factor in making the human infected CGI, as the audiences awareness of them as a special effect drastically reduces the level of horror which would probably have garnered the film an R17/18 rating; something which would have prevented vast swathes of the audience demographic from seeing it and probably would have spelled box office doom given the millions involved. From then on, the film marches steadily on to a denouement which is hurried, rather limp and a complete juxtaposition to the dark themes of the novel. If you're a fan of the novel, you're not going to see it here. The only resemblance to it is the title, the name of the protagonist and, superficially, the situation. Neville is no longer a borderline-alcoholic, blue-collared schmoe barely managing to contain his own self-destructive urges. The scientific examination of the vampire myth that made the book so fascinating is not here.

657079,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00005JPTK,Dave. K,"[4, 8]","Since the mid 90s Hollywood has really been in a rut; everything has to be bigger and louder and basic storytelling has gone out the window. But I'm not gonna totally knock Hollywood they do sometimes get it right. It's just they don't produce the movies they once did. I hoped I Am Legend would be one of the few that worked well, but when all was said and done Hollywood dropped the ball again. I Am Legend had potential to be a really chilling movie, but it never reaches that level.First up I have to mention Will Smith who plays Robert Neville; it's pretty much a one man show and more than half the movie is just Will Smith and his dog. I'll give major credit to Smith who really does a great job at carrying the movie. In general the movies Will Smith does really don't appeal to me, but he is a fantastic actor and does one hell of a job here.I Am Legend is based off the Richard Matheson novel and the screenplay was written by Mark Protosevich & Akiva Goldsman and it's never really interesting. It's not easy to write a screenplay and even harder when you have pretty much one character through a majority of the movie. The concept of the movie is excellent, but their screenplay just doesn't really work. It's not terrible by any means, just isn't all that good. But with the right director it could have possibly worked.Francis Lawrence steps into the director's chair and fails at brining any tension or adventure. The pacing often lacks and he never really gets much going and the action scenes come out weak. Seeing the deserted Manhattan streets is sort creepy as a New Yorker and seeing that makes for a semi chilling moment, but is never as creepy as it could have been. But after a while those shots become tiresome. I never felt that whole end of the world vibe; one of the most chilling scenes in recent memory was the deserted London streets in 28 Days Later, but here with I Am Legend you never get that chilling vibe.The screenplay was flawed, but with the right director I think the movie could have worked. I just never felt any tension, the deserted Manhattan streets are never as chilling as it should have been and the action scenes fail at brining much excitement. The ending was very anti-climatic. What could have been a powerful scene feels rushed and just falls flat.The biggest downfall of the movie is the CGI; first off I really don't like CGI, but depending on the movie I can tolerate it. With a 150-million dollar budget one would think the F/X would come out good, but nope it's terrible and really brings the movie down. I've seen movies done on a much lower budget that ranges from 2-5-million with CGI and it looks on par with this. I've seen movies done under a million that have far better F/X. With the budget I Am Legend had there is no excuse for such shoddy F/X.I Am Legend is just too Hollywood stylized; in some ways it's better than a lot of what's out there. While this does have action scenes it's not done as much as I thought it would be. I expected mindless action scene over and over again and it wasn't. So that's a good thing, but action or not it's too stylized. A movie like this needs more of a gritty look. Again there was potential here, but when all is said and done I Am Legend just lacks in tension and excitement.If you are into big time Hollywood productions odds are I Am Legend will get the job done and you'll enjoy the movie, but for the rest of us we'll mostly be bored. I haven't seen The Omega Man, which is based off the Matheson novel and I Am Legend follows that movie, but I have seen The Last Man on Earth, which is also based off the Matheson novel. My opinion skip this one and check out The Last Man on Earth, while flawed it's far better than this. But again for those who enjoy Hollywood productions you'll probably like this, but the rest will be bored at another Hollywood mishap.",2,Well it had potential,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,3871,"['mid', '90s', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'been', 'rut', 'everything', 'be', 'bigger', 'louder', 'basic', 'storytelling', 'gone', 'out', 'window', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'totally', 'knock', 'Hollywood', 'do', 'sometimes', 'get', 'right', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'produce', 'movies', 'once', 'did', 'hoped', 'Am', 'Legend', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'worked', 'well', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'Hollywood', 'dropped', 'ball', 'again', 'Am', 'Legend', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'really', 'chilling', 'movie', 'never', 'up', 'have', 'mention', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'more', 'movie', 'just', 'Will', 'Smith', 'dog', ""'ll"", 'give', 'major', 'credit', 'Smith', 'who', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'carrying', 'movie', 'general', 'movies', 'Will', 'Smith', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'one', 'hell', 'job', 'here.I', 'Am', 'Legend', 'based', 'off', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Mark', 'Protosevich', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'never', 'really', 'interesting', 'not', 'easy', 'write', 'screenplay', 'even', 'harder', 'when', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'character', 'majority', 'movie', 'concept', 'movie', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'not', 'terrible', 'means', 'just', ""n't"", 'good', 'right', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'worked.Francis', 'Lawrence', 'steps', 'director', 'chair', 'fails', 'brining', 'tension', 'adventure', 'pacing', 'often', 'never', 'really', 'much', 'going', 'action', 'come', 'out', 'weak', 'Seeing', 'deserted', 'Manhattan', 'streets', 'sort', 'creepy', 'New', 'Yorker', 'seeing', 'semi', 'chilling', 'moment', 'never', 'as', 'creepy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'while', 'shots', 'become', 'tiresome', 'never', 'felt', 'whole', 'end', 'world', 'vibe', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'scenes', 'recent', 'memory', 'was', 'deserted', 'London', 'streets', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'here', 'Am', 'Legend', 'never', 'get', 'chilling', 'vibe.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'flawed', 'right', 'director', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'just', 'never', 'felt', 'tension', 'deserted', 'Manhattan', 'streets', 'are', 'never', 'as', 'chilling', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'action', 'scenes', 'fail', 'brining', 'much', 'excitement', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'anti-climatic', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'powerful', 'scene', 'feels', 'rushed', 'just', 'flat.The', 'biggest', 'downfall', 'movie', 'CGI', 'first', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'CGI', 'depending', 'movie', 'can', 'tolerate', '150-million', 'dollar', 'budget', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'F/X', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'good', 'nope', 'terrible', 'really', 'movie', 'down', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'done', 'much', 'lower', 'budget', '2-5-million', 'CGI', 'par', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'done', 'million', 'have', 'far', 'better', 'F/X', 'budget', 'Am', 'Legend', 'had', 'excuse', 'such', 'shoddy', 'F/X.I', 'Am', 'Legend', 'just', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'stylized', 'ways', 'better', 'lot', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'have', 'action', 'scenes', 'not', 'done', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'mindless', 'action', 'scene', 'over', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'So', 'good', 'thing', 'action', 'not', 'too', 'stylized', 'movie', 'more', 'gritty', 'look', 'Again', 'was', 'potential', 'here', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'Am', 'Legend', 'just', 'lacks', 'tension', 'excitement.If', 'are', 'big', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'odds', 'are', 'Am', 'Legend', 'will', 'get', 'job', 'done', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'rest', ""'ll"", 'mostly', 'be', 'bored', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Omega', 'Man', 'based', 'off', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'Am', 'Legend', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'also', 'based', 'off', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'opinion', 'skip', 'one', 'check', 'out', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'flawed', 'far', 'better', 'again', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Hollywood', 'productions', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'rest', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'Hollywood', 'mishap']",I Am Legend
657080,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00005JPTK,David A. Wend,"[2, 6]","I have read several stories by Richard Matheson but not I Am Legend, so I do not have any expectations but I can unequivocally say that a book can never be transitioned to the screen as written; telling a visual story is far different from developing a story on the printed page.  For my wife and me I Am Legend is a terrific thriller that does not let up.  Will Smith gives an excellent performance as Robert Neville who decides to remain behind as Manhattan is cut off from the rest of the world to battle a man-made virus. The emotion level that he reaches in his portrayal beautifully conveys the commitment of his character to find a cure that will save those infected by the virus.  His relationship and devotion to Sam the German Shepard is a joy to watch and becomes distressing for us when Sam succumbs to the virus.Although other reviewers found the film slow I liked the pacing.  First we learn what it is like being the last human on Manhattan by observing Robert Neville performing his everyday chores and activities. We get to know him.  Flashbacks tell the story of Neville's family and their escape from New York into the supposedly safe are beyond.  He has been on his own, alone except for Sam, for three years, and it is the emotional toll, his desperation for someone to talk with, that Will Smith makes so convincing.  He does not meet another human being until the last quarter of the film when Anna saves him from the infected.  When he finally meets Anna, Neville finds it a bit hard to communicate right away and finds her optimism that anyone has survived to be doubtful.The supporting cast includes Will Smith's daughter, Willow, and Salli Richardson as Neville's wife, very brief but nicely played roles.  Although I have seen several virus/zombie films like 28 Days Later and the Dead series by Romero I did find the creatures in this film rather creepy.  The scene where Sam follows a deer into a building held a lot of suspense for me.  The creatures do look a bit unreal sometimes and I took them all to be CGI generated until I learned that someone actually played the ""Alpha-Male"" that attempts to capture Neville.  There are some things about the film that do stretch the imagination a little.  My wife was wondering how destroying the bridges into Manhattan would stop people from getting off the island: couldn't someone build a raft or simply swim.  Was Anna on Manhattan the entire time or did she travel to the island?  There are a few questions like this that are not essential to the story but make one wonder, and require a book to answer all of the sub-plots.I Am Legend is a film that requires more than one viewing to take in marvelous design of a New York being taken over by nature and I think one would be better able to see all of the facets in Will Smith's performance.",5,A Suspensful Thriller,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,2820,"['have', 'read', 'several', 'stories', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'not', 'Am', 'Legend', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'expectations', 'can', 'unequivocally', 'say', 'book', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'transitioned', 'screen', 'written', 'telling', 'visual', 'story', 'far', 'different', 'developing', 'story', 'printed', 'page', 'wife', 'Am', 'Legend', 'terrific', 'thriller', 'not', 'let', 'up', 'Will', 'Smith', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'who', 'remain', 'Manhattan', 'cut', 'off', 'rest', 'world', 'battle', 'man-made', 'virus', 'emotion', 'level', 'portrayal', 'beautifully', 'commitment', 'character', 'find', 'cure', 'will', 'save', 'infected', 'virus', 'relationship', 'devotion', 'Sam', 'German', 'Shepard', 'joy', 'watch', 'becomes', 'distressing', 'when', 'Sam', 'virus.Although', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'film', 'slow', 'liked', 'pacing', 'First', 'learn', 'what', 'being', 'last', 'human', 'Manhattan', 'observing', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'performing', 'everyday', 'chores', 'activities', 'get', 'know', 'Flashbacks', 'tell', 'story', 'Neville', 'family', 'escape', 'New', 'York', 'supposedly', 'safe', 'are', 'been', 'own', 'alone', 'Sam', 'three', 'years', 'emotional', 'toll', 'desperation', 'someone', 'talk', 'Will', 'Smith', 'so', 'convincing', 'not', 'meet', 'human', 'being', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'when', 'Anna', 'infected', 'When', 'finally', 'Anna', 'Neville', 'bit', 'hard', 'communicate', 'right', 'away', 'optimism', 'anyone', 'survived', 'be', 'doubtful.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Will', 'Smith', 'daughter', 'Willow', 'Salli', 'Richardson', 'Neville', 'wife', 'very', 'brief', 'nicely', 'played', 'roles', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'virus/zombie', 'films', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Dead', 'series', 'Romero', 'did', 'find', 'creatures', 'film', 'rather', 'creepy', 'scene', 'where', 'Sam', 'deer', 'building', 'held', 'lot', 'suspense', 'creatures', 'do', 'look', 'bit', 'unreal', 'sometimes', 'took', 'be', 'CGI', 'generated', 'learned', 'someone', 'actually', 'played', 'Alpha-Male', 'capture', 'Neville', 'are', 'things', 'film', 'do', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'little', 'wife', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'destroying', 'bridges', 'Manhattan', 'would', 'stop', 'people', 'getting', 'off', 'island', 'could', ""n't"", 'someone', 'build', 'raft', 'simply', 'swim', 'Was', 'Anna', 'Manhattan', 'entire', 'time', 'did', 'travel', 'island', 'are', 'few', 'questions', 'are', 'not', 'essential', 'story', 'make', 'one', 'wonder', 'require', 'book', 'answer', 'sub-plots.I', 'Am', 'Legend', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'take', 'marvelous', 'design', 'New', 'York', 'being', 'taken', 'over', 'nature', 'think', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'able', 'see', 'facets', 'Will', 'Smith', 'performance']",I Am Legend

There is much to enjoy here.  An empty NYC slowly being reclaimed by nature is perfectly evoked, and Smith is excellent as the lonely man trying to hang on to his life and his sanity long enough to achieve his goal.The early sections of the film are the best.  Director Francis Lawrence and writers Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman establish the mutated survivors as a truly terrifying, unstoppable presence, most notably in a frightening sequence in which Neville enters their lair to look for his dog.  However, they lose their sense of menace in direct proportion to the amount of screen time they get, no doubt due to the fact that they are realized through CGI rather than practical make-up effects.

Will delivers movingly and convincingly on a script that really focuses on giving us a picture of ""what it would be like"" ... to be the last man on earth, living off the land in NYC. This is the real strength of this movie: there's really not a lot of blood or gore or zombie scenes at all. Yet I was riveted as Robert goes through his ""typical days"" in NYC. Every moment was full of pathos and full of menace, too. And occasionally we got some relief from Smith's trademark humor that blended seamlessly with the rest of his performance to give us ""what it would be like"" with a powerful delivery that just leaves me almost breathless.There's an effective use of flashbacks that partly tell us the story of how we got to where we're at in this grim New York City; and the flashbacks also serve to give us an overwhelming contrast between Life Before and Life After the apocalyptic disaster wiped out the city. Yet use of flashback was sparing, which I found all the more effective.Cinematography was excellent throughout, the storyline and script are brilliant, the use of a dog, Samantha, as a key actor was perfect to show us both Robert as companion and Robert as lonely, isolated survivor.I won't give away the ending, but think it was satisfying as far as it goes, but not nearly as appealing, from my angle, as the foregoing material.

The second half degenerates into smaltz.The whole point of Matheson's story is that the title is a play on words.  In our time, adults have frightened their children, and themselves, with stories of goulies, ghosties, and things that go bump in the night.  Probably the most terrifying of these is the vampire, an almost perfect amalgam of sex, blood-lust, and death.  In Matheson's reversal, there is only one human left in a world of vampires, and the human spends the daylight hours hunting and killing the sleeping vampires.  He himself has become the thing of legend; the monster that rules the day instead of the night and the terrifying creature the vampires use to frighten THEIR children.I still think the best rendition was the first one, a black and white film called ""The Last Man on Earth"", with Vincent Price.

Details are very sharp and colors are rich.  This enhances the CGI shots of post-apocalyptic New York City.  As some other reviewers have pointed out, the CGI characters look a bit cartoonish.  It is not so much the appearance that troubled me, however, but rather they way they move.  They run, jump and attack at speeds that defy physics--like the early Spiderman movies.  This makes it all the more obvious that they are CGI.

This movie is based on novel by Richard Matheson of the same name.Synopsis : The Movie starts with a flashback where it is revealed that in 2009 a genetically Re-engineered Measles Virus was created to cure Cancer; later on this Virus undergoes mutation and generates a new lethal airborne based disease which spreads worldwide killing ninety percent of those infected, while the remaining few percent who possessed natural immunity to this virus survived rest turned to a aggressive primal beings who were not able to tolerate Sun Light thus forcing them to hide in the dark till dusk. Slowly most of this immune people where hunted by the infected thus making the central character (Will Smith) as the lone survivor of the holocaust.Will Smith plays as Dr. Robert Neville a US Army Scientist who posses the natural immunity against this airborne disease. He seems to have decided to stay back in Manhattan and try to find a possible cure. His daily day to day routine includes moving across the lonely Manhattan in the day time for hunting and gathering foods while in the night he works in his Lab trying to find a cure. He also waits every day for a response to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, where he instructs any uninfected survivors to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. The only sanity in him is seemed to be kept alive by his only companion 'Samantha' a canine.Very soon his survival becomes difficult, as his once fortified home at Washington Square becomes an imminent attack spot by a group of the Infected. Within the course of time Smith teams up with a woman named Anna and a small boy named Ethan who save him from a night road assault. The movie ultimately winds up with the cure resulting from his blood and Neville's(Smith)sacrifice to protect it.Well I think the whole movie pulled up well with the extraordinary performance by Will Smith. The movies first forty minutes has been really a riveting experience, it just gave us a haunting look of the lonely Manhattan.Though CGI created infected looked a little bit annoying, the overall experience was good. This movie is very much similar to Castaway where Tom Hanks portrays a person marooned in an island. 'I am Legend' may have received mixed reviews from across the world; after all it can be justified as portrayal of person's psychology against all odds and his belief. So in one way the movie has been able to deliver what it had to offer in the first place. If you are looking for lots of action then this movie may not be the right choice; if you are looking for drama with a dark theme then this just proves to do so.If there is no solid ground which rationalizes for watching this film, then Will Smith's performance is ample enough to give this movie a chance.I will rate it 7/10Could have been better...........",4,Brilliant Performance by Will Smith,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,2951,"['Well', 'am', 'not', 'great', 'Fan', 'Movies', 'story', 'line', 'covering', 'Zombies', 'way', 'am', 'Legend', 'taken', 'different', 'approach', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'same', 'name.Synopsis', 'Movie', 'flashback', 'where', 'revealed', '2009', 'genetically', 'Re-engineered', 'Measles', 'Virus', 'was', 'created', 'cure', 'Cancer', 'later', 'Virus', 'undergoes', 'mutation', 'new', 'lethal', 'airborne', 'based', 'disease', 'killing', 'ninety', 'percent', 'infected', 'remaining', 'few', 'percent', 'who', 'possessed', 'natural', 'immunity', 'virus', 'survived', 'rest', 'turned', 'aggressive', 'primal', 'beings', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'able', 'tolerate', 'Sun', 'Light', 'thus', 'forcing', 'hide', 'dark', 'till', 'dusk', 'Slowly', 'most', 'immune', 'people', 'where', 'hunted', 'infected', 'thus', 'making', 'central', 'character', 'Will', 'Smith', 'lone', 'survivor', 'holocaust.Will', 'Smith', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'US', 'Army', 'Scientist', 'who', 'natural', 'immunity', 'airborne', 'disease', 'have', 'decided', 'stay', 'back', 'Manhattan', 'try', 'find', 'possible', 'cure', 'daily', 'day', 'day', 'routine', 'moving', 'lonely', 'Manhattan', 'day', 'time', 'hunting', 'gathering', 'foods', 'night', 'Lab', 'trying', 'find', 'cure', 'also', 'day', 'response', 'continuous', 'recorded', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'where', 'uninfected', 'survivors', 'meet', 'midday', 'South', 'Street', 'Seaport', 'only', 'sanity', 'seemed', 'be', 'kept', 'alive', 'only', 'companion', ""'Samantha"", 'canine.Very', 'soon', 'survival', 'difficult', 'once', 'fortified', 'home', 'Washington', 'Square', 'imminent', 'attack', 'spot', 'group', 'Infected', 'course', 'time', 'Smith', 'teams', 'up', 'woman', 'named', 'Anna', 'small', 'boy', 'named', 'Ethan', 'who', 'save', 'night', 'road', 'assault', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'up', 'cure', 'resulting', 'blood', 'Neville', 'Smith', 'sacrifice', 'protect', 'it.Well', 'think', 'whole', 'movie', 'pulled', 'up', 'well', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'Will', 'Smith', 'movies', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'been', 'really', 'riveting', 'experience', 'just', 'gave', 'haunting', 'look', 'lonely', 'Manhattan.Though', 'CGI', 'created', 'infected', 'looked', 'little', 'bit', 'annoying', 'overall', 'experience', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'similar', 'Castaway', 'where', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'person', 'marooned', 'island', 'am', 'Legend', 'may', 'have', 'received', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'justified', 'portrayal', 'person', 'psychology', 'odds', 'belief', 'So', 'one', 'way', 'movie', 'been', 'able', 'deliver', 'what', 'had', 'offer', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'looking', 'lots', 'action', 'then', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'choice', 'are', 'looking', 'drama', 'dark', 'theme', 'then', 'just', 'do', 'so.If', 'solid', 'ground', 'watching', 'film', 'then', 'Will', 'Smith', 'performance', 'ample', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'chance.I', 'will', 'rate', '7/10Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', '..']",I Am Legend

It might be hard for him to take on but that wasn't the case at all with I Am Legend.  As he plays a viriologist being the only survivor in the city he lives.  There are the ones infected by the virus that basically started because a doctor proclaimed to have a cure for cancer.  But that ""cure"" came at a very precious cost wiping out the majority of life all over the planet.While the creatures that he encounters aren't especially frightening (will not after the first couple times at least).  It still manages to create a tension and excitement throughout the movie.  He has a German shepherd that his only real source of compassion and family as something terrible is revealed later on in the movie.While not overly long, I Am Legend managed to keep me interested and watching.  Primarily because of Smith's character and the struggles he goes through with being the only person alive in the city.  He frequents a video store filled with mannequins and carries friendly conversations with me (which could be considered weird).  But i found it kind of quirky all while picking up the next video to watch that helps him pass the time.

657097,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B00005JPTK,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[2, 3]","Director Francis Lawrence deserves a standing ovation for portraying such haunting images of a deserted Manhattan, its streets and thoroughfares overgrown with weeds and teaming with wild life.  A desolate Times Square long silenced into decay and deterioration has real impact on the viewer.  These images, combined with an exceptional performance by Will Smith, make I AM LEGEND a haunting, yet ultimately satisfying, experience.Smith, with the help of a German Shepherd, aptly carries this movie by himself.  I've seen this actor in numerous films, and in my opinion he's never been better.  The viewer shares Smith's range of emotions--from his determination to eradicate a deadly virus that has decimated the human population, to his fear and terror of the mutated zombies who survived the infection, to his grief over the loss of his family. . .to his utter loneliness and despair.  Intermingled with flashbacks depicting the once-promising virus (a cure for cancer) unleashed in New York, Lawrence and Smith convey a story that systematically builds tension and delivers suspense right to its tragic end.My biggest complaint (and it didn't take away from my enjoyment of this film) had to do with the cartoonish appearance of the zombies.  Bald, charcoal-colored, hairless, shirtless, these monsters with super-human strength and athleticism looked like they belonged in a video game, not a motion picture.  One can only wonder how much more real and convincing this story would have been had real actors been used. . .Regarding the special features of this two-disc set, the first disc includes four animated short features depicting other survivors coping with loneliness and/or despair in other parts of the world--and all four include some very disturbing images.  The second disc is another version of the entire film, featuring what is dubbed a ""controversial ending.""  Having viewed it, I am so glad the theatrical release ended the way it did, as the alternate ending was over the top--way too much of a ""feel good"" ending, and not in keeping with the post-apocalyptic theme of the story.

All of the original's deeper underlying meanings are still there, buried in the actions and expressions of the transfigured creatures Smith does his best to avoid, but without a big reveal to lay all the cards on the table they're too easily shrugged off or overlooked altogether. That positions this as, basically, a hybrid summer blockbuster / suspense-laden monster movie with a better than usual premise. In this role it fares well - Smith portrays the terrifying isolation of the last sane man on Earth with passion and depth, leaving memories of his less-inspired earlier work far in the past. He's come a long way from Independence Day or even Hancock, and surprisingly little of that has the more stern-faced, serious script to thank. Legend's computer effects are a different story: while exceptional at rendering an overgrown, deserted NYC skyline, they feel excessive and overwhelming when it come to the creatures themselves.

Will Smith is great as Neville, but why did they mix up a few different scripts, including using ideas from The Omega Man (which is still my favorite adaptation) rather than SIMPLY USE THE BOOK. I Am Legend is the greatest Vampire Novel ever written. It should be done, one day, as the book, not a conglomeration of ideas from other films. As many have said, the first half of the film is great. Smith alone with his dog (which doesn't happen in the book, but when Neville does find the dog it's the books strongest point), traveling through a devestated New York (and done very well). Where the movie fails though is in a few major points: 1 - Making the infected non-characters.

When major film companies create big-budget movies with highly-paid A-list stars, they deserve, even demand, to be compared to the book they were based on.  And this movie, to put it mildly, is a hugely disappointing adaptation.  They went not for a true-to-the-book ending, but a typical feel-good Hollywood conclusion, with none of the author's emotionally shocking impact.  The movie makers of this joke of a film completely missed the point of the climax and conclusion: it's the book's ending that gives the reason for the awesome title.  It's the book's ending that shocks us with it's unexpected closing sequence.  And it's treatment of the female vampire Neville befriends, turning her into a human with possibly romantic undertones, undercuts and undoes the poignancy of their meeting.This is a movie made with just the most cynical attempt to make a lot of money.

657116,A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,B00005JPTK,"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real""","[11, 14]","By far my dumbest review title, but it gets to the point.  What's the point?  Every time civilization is engulfed in some sort of cannibalistic, zombie-esque plague many questions get begged and then I fail to enjoy the movie.  I hate it when I ruin movies with logic.  I have much more fun when I can let things go.  Unfortunately for me and my wife reality reared its ugly head while watching this film.  Fortunately for the movie, reality does not make it a bad film.  What am I getting at anyway!!?  To save all of us some time, here is a list of bullet statements to explain my problematic reality check of civilizations end (again):(Some of this might be considered ""spoiler"" material so consider yourself warned)-Why do plagues always turn people into cannibals?  And when they turn into cannibals, why don't they eat each other?  In this film the plague-ridden are maniacal, night dwelling blood suckers.  Don't any of them have blood in their bodies to share?-If animals get said plague, as is the case in this film, why would they not try to eat their plague infected masters?  If the plague turns people into animals does it turn animals into... ...more animals??  I guess we should assume that getting the plague and going nuts ends all bigotry and discrimination not only between races, but also species.  If you have the plague you're cool.  If you don't you're dinner.  Hey, another upside to getting the plague!-In real life a plague weakens and kills people. In movies often the plague that ends civilization turns people into super beings.  Not such a bad deal really.  If I could run like the wind, scamper up walls like a squirrel, knock over cars by running into them and endure copious amounts of pain I'd consider taking up the plague voluntarily and become a superhero.  Of course I'd need to work around that urge to eat my fellow man.-Do the infected reproduce (am I nuts or am I the only one in the theater thinking about this stuff?)?  I mean, if they don't do ""the act"" aren't they going to disappear after a couple of generations?  If they do commit ""the act"" do the female plaguies eat the male plaguies when they're done?  I know the zombies don't do it, but you never run out of dead people.  Although, at some point after everyone is a zombie, there is going to be a big rot-fest and everyone will just fall to pieces.  Don't want to be there for that.  In ""28 days later"" people eventually die of the plague, so that works out nicely.-Since plaguies are crazed animals (sort of) and they don't really do anything but hunt for food and since they don't eat each other, wouldn't they eventually run out of food?  What happens when they eat all the healthy people and animals (Whom they greatly outnumber btw)?  Since they don't eat members of the club, this presents a problem.-Are the plague-ridden impervious to extremes in temperature?  Since they seem to have lost most capacity for manufacturing and electricity is becoming a distant memory, how will they stay warm in the winter?  They run around in rags with nothing on their feet, so finding new cloths seems a low priority. Do they migrate?  Hardly seems likely with that inconvenient allergy to UV light.  They do have a high metabolic rate so maybe that helps.  But, without fur covering there skin, it is more than likely that northern Plaguies would eventually die off due to exposure and cold.-Why do plaguies suddenly have the ability to stretch their facial bones every time they want to yell out with an attack scream?  This is kind of a rip-off from ""The Mummy"" movie and really looked fake and out of place in this movie.  I liked it in ""The Mummy"" because that was pure fantasy.  This is sci-fi and it didn't look right.  Using CG was OK for everything else because of the superpowers plaguies possess.  I just don't understand why their jaws needed to stretch.-Does immunity to a zombiesque plague cause you to lose your mind or miss the obvious?  At a crucial point of the movie, we learn that Will is not the sole survivor (a woman and her son pop in).  The woman insists that there are more survivors in a nearby colony.  Will insists there is no one else (boy, does he miss the obvious).  When Will asks the woman why she believes there are more survivors she tells him (paraphrase) ""God says so."".  WHAAAA?!?!  She really does not get fact-based debate.  The correct and obvious answer should have been ""We're here, aren't we?""  Both people missed the most obvious things and that's just not what real people do.-Do any of us want a future with Will Smith in it?  The prospects are bleak; Alien invasion wiping out most of humanity.  Robot rebellion.  Plague infested world full of vampires.  I pick the robots.In the Chuck Hesston version ""Omega Man"", the plague victims become cult members.  Never is cannibalism ever mentioned.  They simply want to get Chuck because he's not one of them and he wants to ""cure"" who they are.  That makes things a lot more feasible in the long run.  ""I Am Legend"" makes a similar point.  He treats the plaguies like animals (a reputation well earned) and subsequently becomes their enemy.  In the end, there are questions who the bad guy is (at least I thought so).There are plenty of tense and scary scenes in which Will Smith does a great job.  A very well made movie that beg lots of silly questions from one silly guy.  These questions kind of ruined the movie for me though.  I would actually recommend avoiding at the theater and buying on DVD.  Theaters are just too expensive these days and there is little advantage to seeing it on the big screen.  Overall a fun movie but you will need to stop asking so many goofy questions if you want to enjoy it.",3,"Not bad for what it is,.. ...but it is what it is and what it is begs

657121,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00005JPTK,Erik North,"[2, 6]","Richard Matheson's 1954 novel ""I Am Legend"" is universally, and rightly, considered a touchstone in modern horror and science fiction literature.  Its story of one man's fight for survival in a world of undead caused by a horrific plague has been the offspring for countless cinematic variations (e.g., NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and 28 DAYS LATER), and two overt cinematic adaptations--1964's THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with Vincent Price); and 1971's THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston).  And now, in our time, it is Will Smith's turn to take up the role of humankind's last best hope in this third adaptation of Matheson's book, using its original title this time.Smith stars as Robert Neville, a virologist who had, in the year 2009, played a pivotal role in the development of a viral cure for cancer that instead turned into a violent plague that decimated the world.  Now, in the year 2012, he roams the deserted streets of the Big Apple with his trusted dog Samantha, foraging for supplies, sending out radio calls into the void in the off-chance that there are real survivors out there--and getting back to his townhouse before nightfall.  For it is nightfall that the Dark Seekers, those plague survivors who have turned into horrible mutants, come out to make his life a living hell.Smith's rationale for staying alive amidst all this horror is the development of a vaccine that can reverse the spread of the virus--a vaccine that he tries on Dark Seekers that he captures.  It also helps him maintain his sanity, as he has terrible flashbacks to the beginnings of the plague.  Once he encounters a totally normal woman (Alice Braga) who has survived in a colony in Vermont, he sees a ray of hope for humanity.  But will he be able to make the promise he made to himself years before come true?It has to be said that, much like the two other films based on it, I AM LEGEND strays significantly from its source material (the monsters in the book are vampires, and the setting is Los Angeles, not New York).  Indeed, this third version takes its cue as much from the John Corrington/Joyce Corrington screenplay of THE OMEGA MAN as it does from Matheson's book, particularly in Smith's attempt to develop a cure for the plague.  Also, the Dark Seekers, as they are conceived, look a little too much like what they really are, namely CGI creations, as opposed to the pale vampires of THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, or the Manson-like mutant cult of THE OMEGA MAN.All the same however, I AM LEGEND works well enough because Smith, who holds the screen all by himself for three-fourths of its running time, is able to convince us of his character's situation--concern; panic; horror; and much more.  Though some of the special effects are a tad bit excessive on occasion, director Francis Lawrence and screenwriters Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevitch manage to conjure up enought suspenseful situations to make this enterprise more than tolerable, and on many occasions very frightening.It may be that Matheson's book is unfilmable the way Matheson wrote it, what with Hollywood's concern for thrills and chills at the expense of the novel's psychological and scientific horror.  But Smith's performance and the scenes of a completely deserted Big Apple are more than enough to paper over the flaws, and make I AM LEGEND a very good cross of horror and science fiction the likes of which have not really been seen in Hollywood for quite some time.",4,"Three Times A ""Legend""",1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,3441,"['Richard', 'Matheson', '1954', 'Am', 'Legend', 'universally', 'rightly', 'considered', 'touchstone', 'modern', 'horror', 'science', 'fiction', 'literature', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'fight', 'survival', 'world', 'undead', 'caused', 'horrific', 'plague', 'been', 'offspring', 'countless', 'cinematic', 'variations', 'e.g.', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', '28', 'DAYS', 'LATER', 'two', 'overt', 'cinematic', 'adaptations', '1964', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'ON', 'EARTH', 'Vincent', 'Price', '1971', 'THE', 'OMEGA', 'MAN', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'now', 'time', 'Will', 'Smith', 'turn', 'take', 'up', 'role', 'humankind', 'last', 'best', 'hope', 'third', 'adaptation', 'Matheson', 'book', 'using', 'original', 'title', 'time.Smith', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'virologist', 'who', 'had', 'year', '2009', 'played', 'pivotal', 'role', 'development', 'viral', 'cure', 'cancer', 'instead', 'turned', 'violent', 'plague', 'decimated', 'world', 'Now', 'year', '2012', 'deserted', 'streets', 'Big', 'Apple', 'trusted', 'dog', 'Samantha', 'foraging', 'supplies', 'sending', 'out', 'radio', 'void', 'off-chance', 'are', 'real', 'survivors', 'out', 'there', 'getting', 'back', 'townhouse', 'nightfall', 'Dark', 'Seekers', 'plague', 'survivors', 'who', 'have', 'turned', 'horrible', 'mutants', 'come', 'make', 'life', 'living', 'hell.Smith', 'rationale', 'staying', 'alive', 'amidst', 'horror', 'development', 'vaccine', 'can', 'reverse', 'spread', 'virus', 'vaccine', 'Dark', 'Seekers', 'also', 'maintain', 'sanity', 'terrible', 'flashbacks', 'beginnings', 'plague', 'Once', 'totally', 'normal', 'woman', 'Alice', 'Braga', 'who', 'survived', 'colony', 'Vermont', 'ray', 'hope', 'humanity', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'promise', 'made', 'years', 'come', 'true', 'be', 'said', 'much', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'based', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'significantly', 'source', 'material', 'monsters', 'book', 'are', 'vampires', 'setting', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'not', 'New', 'York', 'Indeed', 'third', 'version', 'cue', 'much', 'John', 'Corrington/Joyce', 'Corrington', 'screenplay', 'THE', 'OMEGA', 'MAN', 'Matheson', 'book', 'particularly', 'Smith', 'attempt', 'develop', 'cure', 'plague', 'Also', 'Dark', 'Seekers', 'are', 'conceived', 'look', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'really', 'are', 'namely', 'CGI', 'creations', 'opposed', 'pale', 'vampires', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'ON', 'EARTH', 'Manson-like', 'mutant', 'cult', 'THE', 'OMEGA', 'MAN.All', 'same', 'however', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'well', 'enough', 'Smith', 'who', 'screen', 'three-fourths', 'running', 'time', 'able', 'convince', 'character', 'situation', 'concern', 'panic', 'horror', 'much', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'tad', 'bit', 'excessive', 'occasion', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'screenwriters', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'Mark', 'Protosevitch', 'manage', 'conjure', 'up', 'enought', 'suspenseful', 'situations', 'make', 'enterprise', 'more', 'tolerable', 'many', 'occasions', 'very', 'frightening.It', 'may', 'be', 'Matheson', 'book', 'unfilmable', 'way', 'Matheson', 'wrote', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'concern', 'thrills', 'chills', 'expense', 'novel', 'psychological', 'scientific', 'horror', 'Smith', 'performance', 'scenes', 'completely', 'deserted', 'Big', 'Apple', 'are', 'more', 'enough', 'paper', 'flaws', 'make', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'very', 'good', 'cross', 'horror', 'science', 'fiction', 'likes', 'have', 'not', 'really', 'been', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'quite', 'time']",I Am Legend

It really made me feel compassionate towards the character as I can't imagine what it's like to be so lonely you've resorted to speaking to inanimate objects as if they are real.The most surprising part of the film is seeing a city, absent of life, at the beginning. It was kind of creepy with the one man, one dog and deserted land.I think the zombies could have been made better; they could have been made to look more `real' as they appeared rather computerized. Otherwise, they added a layer of chilling horror to the film.In the film, a sickness wipes out the world, Robert Neville (Will Smith) appears to be the only survivor, immune to the disease that has taken everyone else. While trying to avoid going `nuts', he perseveres in search for a cure for the disease that has killed off humanity and left the others as carnivorous zombies.

Otherwise, it deserves every star provided.  That being said, I've read the novel, I read it before the movie came out, and I loved it.  However, this representation of the movie is a goodly distance removed from the novel, enough so that I'm considering it loosely based and not responsible for the differences.  It would be like saying well, 10 Things I Hate About You didn't follow Taming of the Shrew to a tee.  It's too far removed from the original to be so comparative.Now that that justification is out of the way, personally, I find this to be a superb film.  It's main protagonist, a military man immune to the disease that has killed everyone globally and contaminated the rest into what are called &#34;Dark Seekers&#34;.  A zombie-vampire equivalent that has heightened aggression, stamina, and rage.  Robert Neville is left with his dog, a German Shepherd named Sam, to face an empty New York City.  He survives well enough, though his mental state is strained from lack of social contact, while simultaneously trying to create a cure from his blood to fix the Dark Seekers.Not only is the story riveting and compelling, especially with such a small cast, but the little intricacies of the film are absolutely stunning.  With shots of gas stations with $7 price per gallon tags, hoards of money left to sit, forgotten, in abandoned buildings, and the primal development of NYC and the dystopia it finds itself in is brilliant.  It isn't a hard stretch of the metaphor to see the clear implications of humans tampering with medicine and how, like most end-of-the-world films, we will be the cause of our greatest demise.Again, as a stand alone movie loosely based off of a novel from many years past, it is a great story and a great visual representation of dystopic, metaphorically accurate devolution of humans and the future.",5,If You're a Literature Perfectionist Then Just Don't Bother,1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,1987,"['title', 'review', 'states', ""'re"", 'literature', 'perfectionist', 'then', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'going', 'taint', 'view', 'movie', 'Otherwise', 'star', 'provided', 'being', 'said', ""'ve"", 'read', 'novel', 'read', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'loved', 'However', 'representation', 'movie', 'goodly', 'distance', 'removed', 'novel', 'enough', ""'m"", 'considering', 'loosely', 'based', 'not', 'responsible', 'differences', 'would', 'be', 'saying', 'well', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'tee', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'original', 'be', 'so', 'comparative.Now', 'justification', 'way', 'personally', 'find', 'be', 'superb', 'film', 'main', 'protagonist', 'military', 'man', 'immune', 'disease', 'killed', 'everyone', 'globally', 'contaminated', 'rest', 'what', 'are', 'called', '34', 'Dark', 'Seekers', '34', 'zombie-vampire', 'equivalent', 'heightened', 'aggression', 'stamina', 'rage', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'left', 'dog', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'named', 'Sam', 'face', 'empty', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'well', 'enough', 'mental', 'state', 'strained', 'lack', 'social', 'contact', 'simultaneously', 'trying', 'create', 'cure', 'blood', 'fix', 'Dark', 'Seekers.Not', 'only', 'story', 'riveting', 'compelling', 'especially', 'such', 'small', 'cast', 'little', 'intricacies', 'film', 'are', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'shots', 'gas', 'stations', '7', 'price', 'gallon', 'tags', 'hoards', 'money', 'left', 'sit', 'forgotten', 'abandoned', 'buildings', 'primal', 'development', 'NYC', 'dystopia', 'brilliant', ""n't"", 'hard', 'stretch', 'metaphor', 'see', 'clear', 'implications', 'humans', 'tampering', 'medicine', 'how', 'most', 'end-of-the-world', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'cause', 'greatest', 'demise.Again', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'novel', 'many', 'years', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'visual', 'representation', 'dystopic', 'metaphorically', 'accurate', 'devolution', 'humans', 'future']",I Am Legend

Breathtaking scenery and an impressive silence which dominates a large part of the movie.

Why the makers opted for this is beyond me, because real actors would have been much cheaper I think and the creatures aren't exotic or weird at all, merely hyper-agressive zombies. In my opinion simple make-up would have done the trick quite excellently. It does not subtract from the tension, though, which is riveting, but for me it would have been the icing on top of the cake.

It is not what it was marketed as: a horror/SF/zombie popcorn flick. It's not even an action movie or a thriller, although it does contain elements of those genres.So, what is it?  It's a darkly inspiring, bleak, existential drama that looks at the price that heroes quite often pay for living out their ideals.The main (virtually the only) character is a research scientist living in a post-apocalyptic NYC, who is struggling to find a cure for a monstrous virus that has claimed 90% of the world's population.  Most of the survivors have been turned into vicious, inhuman ghoul-like creatures that rule the night.Smith is one of the few humans that is naturally immune to the virus, and his decision to stay is motivated by his belief that he can find an effective treatment for the illness.  Unfortunately, many of the pitiful victims he wants to help are now inhuman monsters that try very hard to kill him.Smith lives in NYC alone, his only companion a female German shepherd.He spends the sunlit hours playing golf, watching movies and researching the virus that caused the global holocaust.But, when the sun starts to set, he retreats to a fortified house in the city, where he endures the sounds of the ""dark seekers"", the creatures that have been created by the disease, stalking the streets outside while he tries to sleep.Most of the film revolves around Smith dealing with the consequences of staying in the city, instead of leaving it before it was sealed off.Those consequences include maddening loneliness that drives him to talk to mannequins, memorize film lines and treat his canine friend more like a human child than a dog.Be aware: this is not a happy movie, and the ending is both depressing and hopeful.  Smith pays a horrific penalty indeed for his decision to stay in the city and fight the disease.The most gripping scene in the film to me was Smith locked in a room sealed by a glass door, with the creatures breaking in.  He pleads with them to stop trying to kill him, not out of fear, but out of his desire to cure the illness that has turned them into monsters.  But their cries of hatred and blood lust drown him out.I think that the scene says something very profound about the sad depravity of human nature, and our tendency to destroy the very things that offer us an escape from the unrelenting meaninglessness of our lives.So, in summary: don't go to this film looking for a special effects extravaganza, although the special effects are actually quite good.  Don't go looking for a shoot 'em up thrill ride, although there is plenty of shooting and creatures getting blown away.  If you go, expect a profoundly moving human drama that, if you open your heart to its message, will cause you to think deeply about the reality of evil, and the price we may have to pay to defeat it.Recommended to the highest degree.",5,"Richard Matheson meets Albert Camus; or, the film in search of an audience",1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,2914,"['can', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'getting', 'wildly', 'disparate', 'reviews', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'marketed', 'horror/SF/zombie', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'not', 'even', 'action', 'movie', 'thriller', 'contain', 'elements', 'genres.So', 'what', 'darkly', 'inspiring', 'bleak', 'existential', 'drama', 'price', 'quite', 'often', 'pay', 'living', 'out', 'ideals.The', 'main', 'virtually', 'only', 'character', 'research', 'scientist', 'living', 'post-apocalyptic', 'NYC', 'who', 'struggling', 'find', 'cure', 'monstrous', 'virus', 'claimed', '90', '%', 'world', 'population', 'Most', 'survivors', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'vicious', 'inhuman', 'ghoul-like', 'creatures', 'rule', 'night.Smith', 'one', 'few', 'humans', 'naturally', 'immune', 'virus', 'decision', 'stay', 'motivated', 'belief', 'can', 'find', 'effective', 'treatment', 'illness', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'pitiful', 'victims', 'help', 'are', 'now', 'inhuman', 'monsters', 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'kill', 'him.Smith', 'lives', 'NYC', 'alone', 'only', 'companion', 'female', 'German', 'shepherd.He', 'sunlit', 'hours', 'playing', 'golf', 'watching', 'movies', 'researching', 'virus', 'caused', 'global', 'holocaust.But', 'when', 'sun', 'set', 'fortified', 'house', 'city', 'where', 'sounds', 'dark', 'seekers', 'creatures', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'disease', 'stalking', 'streets', 'outside', 'sleep.Most', 'film', 'Smith', 'dealing', 'consequences', 'staying', 'city', 'instead', 'leaving', 'was', 'sealed', 'off.Those', 'consequences', 'include', 'maddening', 'loneliness', 'talk', 'mannequins', 'memorize', 'film', 'lines', 'treat', 'canine', 'friend', 'more', 'human', 'child', 'dog.Be', 'aware', 'not', 'happy', 'movie', 'ending', 'depressing', 'hopeful', 'Smith', 'horrific', 'penalty', 'indeed', 'decision', 'stay', 'city', 'fight', 'disease.The', 'most', 'gripping', 'scene', 'film', 'was', 'Smith', 'locked', 'room', 'sealed', 'glass', 'door', 'creatures', 'breaking', 'stop', 'trying', 'kill', 'not', 'fear', 'desire', 'cure', 'illness', 'turned', 'monsters', 'cries', 'hatred', 'blood', 'lust', 'out.I', 'think', 'scene', 'something', 'very', 'profound', 'sad', 'depravity', 'human', 'nature', 'tendency', 'destroy', 'very', 'things', 'offer', 'escape', 'unrelenting', 'meaninglessness', 'lives.So', 'summary', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'film', 'looking', 'special', 'effects', 'extravaganza', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'looking', 'shoot', 'up', 'thrill', 'ride', 'plenty', 'shooting', 'creatures', 'getting', 'blown', 'away', 'go', 'expect', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'human', 'drama', 'open', 'heart', 'message', 'will', 'cause', 'think', 'deeply', 'reality', 'evil', 'price', 'may', 'have', 'pay', 'defeat', 'it.Recommended', 'highest', 'degree']",I Am Legend

657135,AY12DBB0U420B,B00005JPTK,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""I Am Legend"" starring Will Smith. I got it at Wal-Mart off the five-dollar rack. First of all, I was unaware of the movie or the book on which it was based. Second, my feelings for the movie are extremely mixed. First, my reaction to the discovery of a cancer cure which morphs into a rabies-like virus and wipes out the Manhattan population is skeptical, to say the least. Well, I know this is unadulterated fiction, so I'll try to give it some slack. But secondly, the depiction of Manhattan as a devastated city is exceptionally good and I'm left wondering how in the world did they ever do it? The streets are cluttered with cars as if everything was just abandoned after the sounding of an alarm. After three years, all the streets are overgrown with mature-sized weeds growing from cracks in the pavement wherever Smith might go, and he covers a lot of territory. The city looks completely abandoned and in bad decay. Well Done! Whoever put this together ought to get an award of some type. And, alas, from this as a start, I would expect a really good movie to follow.Well, this well-crafted scene just doesn't hold up. Smith has an office-laboratory where he labors to save the world and it is fully electrified. Full lighted. All the machines work. It even has a working TV. And the computer works, including the internet. And his car works fine as he motors about the city, never getting low on gas, although he's been there three years. And he sends a broadcast out over the airwaves of the city ever day trying to find out if anyone else might be there. Huh? How could this be? It just doesn't wash. All of a sudden I find myself involved in a story I couldn't possibly believe. At about this point, there's the appearance of human-like monsters and monster dogs which are infected with a rabies-like virus and are insanely violent and after his hide. I'm sorry folks, the story just lost me totally and I just couldn't bear the last half.The movie had promise. Too bad the last half wasn't up to the first half. As it is, I'd have to congratulate some of the special effects people (the NYC scene) and let the others know what an awful job they did (the monsters). What an incongruent mix! Who's responsible for this mess anyway?. Well, I'd have to say that Smith's acting was fairly good. My condolences to him for being stuck in such a preposterous script.Gary Peterson",3,Well Done NYC Depiction. Lack of Credibility.

657136,AHB0L35LOICAN,B00005JPTK,"GB Banks (publisher, author) "", author""","[2, 3]","I must admit that I came into my viewing of ""I Am Legend at a disadvantage. First, I haven't read the book upon which it was based (something I hope to correct soon). In addition, I'd heard much about the movie, both how brilliant Will Smith was in the role that had him alone on the screen for a significant portion of the movie, and also how the movie supposedly degrades in the last third. So when I finally got to see the movie last night, I was entirely unsure what to expect.Having now seen ""I Am Legend,"" I believe that the movie will go down as one of the classics in science fiction cinema. The cinematography is outstanding. When you see the epic shots of New York having been reclaimed by the wilderness, now the domain for the likes of lions and deer, the streets either clogged with deserted cars or choked by vegetation, you really believe that you are in the midst of the greatest tragedy of our modern times. The story is masterfully told in such a way that rather than being forced through a long expositional section providing the back story, or subjected to drawn out flashbacks that interrupt the forward momentum, the past is revealed in brief flashbacks, video clips that Smith's character, Robert Neville, constantly plays on his television, and other subtle but prevalent clues like photographs and newspaper clippings that are cleverly positioned within various scenes throughout early parts of the movie. This film, unlike many others these days, doesn't operate under the assumption that its audience is fairly clueless. It respects its audience, and I very much respect the film for that.Both Will Smith and his canine companion quickly become beloved friends whom you care for, which makes the twists and turns that occur later on all the more moving. When the enormity of the very fact that, in Neville's mind, he is the only living human left on the earth (besides the vampire-like creatures who used to be humans) hits you, you too begin to feel the weight of his loneliness and can then understand why he is in many ways slowly going insane. If not for the daily ritual that he's structured his life around, one gets the feeling that this man would have ended his own life long before. And there's something haunting about the base story here, that some tragic event could in fact leave a once life-filled metropolis like New York a cold, empty monument to a once mighty race of beings. Could our own quest for advancement one day be our undoing?While I must admit that the movie does seem to rush toward the ending, with the climatic moments seeming to come too soon after a major plot twist changes Neville's entire world view, I don't have a problem with the way the story ends. I suppose the ending is more ""Hollywood"" and less ""deep"" than I assume that the book is, but the ending in itself is very well done, and given the ordeal that this character has gone through, is one that works well for me. I just wish more time had been spent getting us to the ending because what this movie had, which far too few movies in this genre have today, is a solid plot that fed both the appetite of the action junkie and the person who prefers a great story. Another minor fault I must hold against the film is the vampire creatures, who would have been far more compelling if they were played by real people rather than CGI. The only CGI character that has yet to truly come alive within a real world setting is Gollum from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and that character was built upon the brilliant acting of Andy Serkis.""I Am Legend"" isn't perfect, and the fact that it came so close is what's most frustrating to me as a fan of both Will Smith and this genre of film, but what it does provide, it does so very well. This is a fun, thought-provoking film that years from now will be one of Smith's most lauded performances.

657137,A1IT9VY8Z9RG92,B00005JPTK,"G. D. Williams ""gareth37""","[3, 4]","I AM LEGENDWhen Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND came off the press in 1954, he had no idea that his story of the future would see three film incarnations.  In 1964 LAST MAN ON EARTH with Vincent Price premiered with its stark black and white images of a war torn European city. 1971's OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston reflected the current society of the late 60's with its violent iconoclasts.In 2007 Will Smith would bring a different take on the character of a noble scientist in I AM LEGEND.  With his faithful companion, Sam, a devoted German shepherd given to him by his daughter, he patrolled the desolate streets of New York City during the day.Every day he broadcasted the same message to an apparently silent world.  ""Food, shelter and security"" were more than words to this Dr. Robert Neville.  For him and Sam over 1000 lonely days have passed since the end came. Sometimes, the desire for the past can  lead one to the verge of insanity, especially of the past is clouded by the mists of lost hopes.Unfortunately, the end did not come for those humans who mutated after exposure to the miracle cure for cancer.  They became a new species who lived together like a hive in the shadows of dead buildings.  They became prowlers roaming the streets at night searching for fresh blood.The only fault of this film is that the mutants both human and dogs are too super in their abilities.  Unlike the previous two films, the mutants are not really believable, especially the dogs.  It is difficult to have pity for them since every trace of humanity has been ripped from their souls.  However, there is a twist near the end of the film.Neville's experiments on the mutants were his desperate attempt to find a cure, to bring normalcy back to a barbaric land filled with savages.  Of course, the mutants knew him and Sam all too well.  During the day they were ever watching for him from the dark shadows of their lives.  This day creature and his dog were their mortal enemies.The story is well written.  Will Smith gives another A+++ performance. James Newton Howard adds another excellent musical score to his impressive library.This DVD contains an alternate ending on disk two which differs from the first two films.  In many ways, I prefer this ending to the theatre version.This is what the second disk offers: for there comes a time, when two evolving races must find common ground or face total annihilation.

This makes it a rather monumental oopsie. Anyway, that's it for Emma Thompson, whose early cameo establishes the post-apocalyptic premise. She's never seen again in this film. But she's done enough.I AM LEGEND is the third film adapting Richard Matheson's classic horror story, although, far as I'm concerned, no one yet's come close to doing justice to the novel. In terms of how it stacks up against the previous two adaptations, I prefer I AM LEGEND over THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston) but not over THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with a fantastic Vincent Price). Will Smith's performance is top notch. Respecting the bleak tone of the movie, Smith stays away from his trademark touches of humor. Instead, Smith delivers one of his strongest performances, plays up his terrific knack for garnering the movie audiences' sympathy. With expressions of despair and horror perpetually etched on his features, Smith humanizes the hell out of his character.Films like this underscore just how fragile and ephemeral society can be. You topple the infrastructure and break society's contract, and where are we? A palpable sense of desolation, this disquieting thing, shoots thru you as you take in scenes of a deserted New York City. The story picks up there three years after Emma Thompson's cataclysmic bungle. We meet virologist Dr. Robert Neville, the city's (and maybe the world's) last surviving human - as he and his dog Sam tool around the empty, weedy streets in a sports car. In the intervening years - or, as I'm wont to call it, the Post-Emma Thompson Age - Neville has grown strange and a bit mad. Loneliness will do that, and as well that nagging sense that you may be the last left of your kind. Neville, who is immune to the monster-making virus, has never stopped his efforts to unearth a cure, conducting experiments in his basement laboratory. Every day he wakes up and goes about his daily routine. H exercises. He frequents the local video store (in which he'll socialize with mannequins he'd clothed). When the sun reaches its zenith, he waits at the sea port hoping against hope to rendezvous with other survivors. He occasionally hunts for game (wild life, CG-rendered, now dot the cityscape). He's home before dark, barricading his sunlit house with heavy steel shutters. And, after dark, the monsters come out. Maybe the film's most harrowing moment, and the most heartbreaking, is when we glimpse Neville, weapon in hand, and his dog Sam cowering in the bathtub as terrible noises from the outside bombard their ears. The fear is palpable.Dr. Robert Neville has been in a rut, and it takes two game-changing events to flip the scenario. The first event shatters his spirits. The second one heralds the arrival of a woman named Anna (the gorgeous Alice Braga) and a young boy named Ethan, both of whom have listened to Neville's recorded daily radio brodasts and decided to take a chance. At this juncture, Will Smith's acting chops come into play again as his character demonstrates the jarring awkwardness and confusion one goes thru when introduced to company after having been alone for so long. Anna and Ethan serve to regalvanize the plot, toss it down a new direction.The zombies - or Dark Seekers - up the jeopardy by proving to have more game than just skittering around, biting human flesh. One particular zombie exhibits a measure of cunning and, in fact, turns the tables on Neville, and does this in a deliberately ironic way. The one knock against these zombies is that the CG rendering is just a hair off. The film's third act, in fact, is just a hair off as things degenerate into a series of garden variety action sets.

I loved it even more when I saw the version with the alternate ending, and that's pretty much the way I prefer watching it because I hated what happened to Will Smith in the end of the original version.When this movie had first come out onto DVD and Blu-Ray, I initally picked up the DVD because I did not yet have Blu-Ray capabilities, but eventually I bought myself a PlayStation 3 and among one of the first movies I upgraded to Blu-Ray after a handful of classics was I Am Legend.I'd been familiar with the ultimate collector's editions of the film but never bought one at the time, mostly because money was tight and they were a bit more expensive back then.  However, I finally broke down and decided to buy one of them.  I already owned the Blu-Ray copy, and for the longest time I had seen a DVD ultimate collector's edition set sitting up on top of a cabinet containing movie sets at a local entertainment store I frequent, and I would always eyeball it when I was in there.Eventually the set hit $14.99, and a while later I had happened to have some Christmas movie & finally broke down and decided to buy it.  I loved that movie and I couldn't stand to see that cool set sit there and collect dust.  Having the Blu-Ray, I will always watch that, but I bought the set if nothing other than for pure nostalgia.  It has some cool collectibles and I just like owning it.So yes, this is a bit more of a story as to how I came across this than an actual review, but review wise...if you are a fan of this movie, this collector's set, whether Blu-Ray or DVD, is pretty cool and it would be a cool collectible for anyone who enjoys this movie.  I think eventually I'm even going to try and incorporate my Blu-Ray copy into it, if I ever come across a slim enough case.

657160,A1B83POK9C91OP,B00005JPTK,HollyC.Ong,"[2, 3]","I Am Legend is a movie and novel consisting of zombies, cancer, and a sunset. These ideas link and weave into each other throughout one man's journey to find an ultimate escape after the cure for cancer goes horribly wrong. Robert Neville, (played by Will Smith) and his German Shepard named Sam, must escape the wrath of the Darkseekers, the mutants inhabiting New York City, in order to escape to a colony with other immune survivors. This film is one of the most intriguing of this decade due to the insightful, yet haunting, peek into the future.As the story begins as a flashback in New York City, ambulance sirens are wailing as police control the crowds, and doctors check the health of passengers, hoping to escape the city onto helicopters. News reports of the cure for cancer were displaying on TVs within the city. A woman was reporting on the genetic mistake while finding the cure, informing that an epidemic is started. Robert Neville, a Lieutenant Colonel, is taken with his family into a truck, heading towards the landing pad for a helicopter. Neville is taken from his family on to a helicopter, escaping the virus and the city. He will never see them again. The helicopter soon crashes, and he is the only one left. Or so he thought.As the mutant humans push forwards toward the injured protagonist and the hopeless dog, the sunset is what controls them. The shade from the sun slowly creeps toward the car as Neville hides behind, unable to walk. Now, the zombies are on edge, can already taste the blood. Growling erupts as they are ten feet away. Nine feet... eight feet... panic erupts on Neville's face as he clutches Sam, hoping the pain will not last long. Seven feet... six feet... they are clawing at the edge, prepared to pounce. Five... four... three... two... he clutches his fists as the hope is drained from his face. He puts his head down and the screen shows Sam being bitten and the mutants closing in on Neville. This is what the future could possibly look like, the reason why I Am Legend is such an on-the-edge movie.Later, Neville finds a woman and girl in an abandoned house. This foreshadows hope, but only for a short period of time. He captures a zombie and begins tests on it. Sam has been strangled to keep the emotional pain from Neville. As the others hide behind a safe, Plexiglas wall, Neville attempts to get the genetic combinations correct, yet isn't fast enough. The zombies find their way into the apartment. He runs in with the other two, and protects them in a secret room, as a mutant busts his head through the wall. Neville shuts the secret door to save the woman and girl, while he pulls a grenade from his pocket. The horde finally reaches through the wall and they rush forward. The pin is pulled and it is all over, only two remain.I Am Legend provides an easy, yet insightful read or watch. It shows an interesting twist on the future of our world. Solving a cure for cancer might not be the brightest idea we have had in years. Although it seems far-fetched, it proves a good point and is a dynamic movie. Some scenes are sad, some are action packed, and some force you to use your brain. Overall, this movie has concepts beyond our grasp, which twists reality into a fictional, frightening story.The movie also has many hidden lessons for people to help display their personality. It shows that teamwork can overcome much larger problems. This is displayed throughout the movie after the point of Neville finding the two others in the city. The movie also displays sacrifice for others resulting in survival of the horde after Neville pulls the pin. Finally, it shows a route of survival different from many ordinary ideas. To wrap things up, I Am Legend pulls an insightful twist on the future and a gruesome fictional reality.",5,Interesting Peek into the Future,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,3795,"['Am', 'Legend', 'movie', 'novel', 'consisting', 'zombies', 'cancer', 'sunset', 'ideas', 'link', 'weave', 'other', 'one', 'man', 'journey', 'find', 'ultimate', 'escape', 'cure', 'cancer', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'played', 'Will', 'Smith', 'German', 'Shepard', 'named', 'Sam', 'must', 'escape', 'wrath', 'Darkseekers', 'mutants', 'inhabiting', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'order', 'escape', 'colony', 'other', 'immune', 'survivors', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'decade', 'due', 'insightful', 'yet', 'haunting', 'peek', 'future.As', 'story', 'flashback', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'ambulance', 'sirens', 'are', 'wailing', 'police', 'control', 'crowds', 'doctors', 'check', 'health', 'passengers', 'hoping', 'escape', 'city', 'helicopters', 'News', 'reports', 'cure', 'cancer', 'were', 'displaying', 'TVs', 'city', 'woman', 'was', 'reporting', 'genetic', 'mistake', 'finding', 'cure', 'informing', 'epidemic', 'started', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'taken', 'family', 'truck', 'heading', 'landing', 'pad', 'helicopter', 'Neville', 'taken', 'family', 'helicopter', 'escaping', 'virus', 'city', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'helicopter', 'soon', 'crashes', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'so', 'mutant', 'humans', 'push', 'forwards', 'injured', 'protagonist', 'hopeless', 'dog', 'sunset', 'what', 'shade', 'sun', 'slowly', 'car', 'Neville', 'unable', 'walk', 'Now', 'zombies', 'are', 'edge', 'can', 'already', 'taste', 'blood', 'Growling', 'erupts', 'are', 'ten', 'feet', 'away', 'Nine', 'feet', 'eight', 'feet', 'panic', 'erupts', 'Neville', 'face', 'Sam', 'hoping', 'pain', 'will', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'Seven', 'feet', 'six', 'feet', 'are', 'clawing', 'edge', 'prepared', 'pounce', 'Five', 'four', 'three', 'two', 'fists', 'hope', 'drained', 'face', 'head', 'down', 'screen', 'Sam', 'being', 'bitten', 'mutants', 'closing', 'Neville', 'what', 'future', 'could', 'possibly', 'look', 'reason', 'why', 'Am', 'Legend', 'such', 'on-the-edge', 'movie.Later', 'Neville', 'woman', 'girl', 'abandoned', 'house', 'hope', 'only', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'zombie', 'tests', 'Sam', 'been', 'strangled', 'keep', 'emotional', 'pain', 'Neville', 'others', 'hide', 'safe', 'Plexiglas', 'wall', 'Neville', 'get', 'genetic', 'combinations', 'correct', 'yet', ""n't"", 'fast', 'enough', 'zombies', 'find', 'way', 'apartment', 'other', 'two', 'secret', 'room', 'mutant', 'head', 'wall', 'Neville', 'secret', 'door', 'save', 'woman', 'girl', 'grenade', 'pocket', 'horde', 'finally', 'wall', 'rush', 'forward', 'pin', 'pulled', 'over', 'only', 'two', 'remain.I', 'Am', 'Legend', 'easy', 'yet', 'insightful', 'read', 'watch', 'interesting', 'twist', 'future', 'world', 'Solving', 'cure', 'cancer', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'brightest', 'idea', 'have', 'had', 'years', 'far-fetched', 'good', 'point', 'dynamic', 'movie', 'scenes', 'are', 'sad', 'are', 'action', 'packed', 'force', 'use', 'brain', 'Overall', 'movie', 'concepts', 'grasp', 'reality', 'fictional', 'frightening', 'story.The', 'movie', 'also', 'many', 'hidden', 'lessons', 'people', 'help', 'display', 'personality', 'teamwork', 'can', 'overcome', 'much', 'larger', 'problems', 'displayed', 'movie', 'point', 'Neville', 'finding', 'two', 'others', 'city', 'movie', 'also', 'sacrifice', 'others', 'resulting', 'survival', 'horde', 'Neville', 'pin', 'Finally', 'route', 'survival', 'different', 'many', 'ordinary', 'ideas', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'Am', 'Legend', 'insightful', 'twist', 'future', 'gruesome', 'fictional', 'reality']",I Am Legend
657161,A1LW3XGXYP98BW,B00005JPTK,H. Pace,"[1, 1]","I Am Legend is the third movie adaptation of the classic Richard Matheson.  I have neither read the book nor seen the earlier adaptations so this was my first exposure to the story.Will Smith plays Dr. Robert Neville, the last man in New York City after a cancer cure gone horribly awry kills most of humanity and leaves most of the people left as what can best be described as vampire-zombies.  Dr. Neville is the rare immune and the even rarer survivor.  Smith is only actor on screen the vast majority of the film, so the film lives or dies by his performance.  Thankfully, it is virtuoso.The strength of the film is the struggle of Dr. Neville, a military scientist, to find a cure for the virus while holding onto his own sanity.  I get stir crazy after three days without human interaction; Dr. Neville spends three years without human interaction.  All this after he sees everything he knew and loved burn away.  It makes for an emotionally brutal movie.Sadly, it is the film's emotional resonance that caused me problems.  It got me to thinking about the movie, which is generally good, but I Am Legend is the kind of movie that doesn't stand up well to close examination.  There are logical holes you could drive a truck through.  Some of this can be chalked up to Dr. Neville's declining sanity, but it's still tough to swallow.  And it's the kind of thing that could have been tightened up with a little more care.CGI is relied upon heavily, but is somewhat hit or miss.  A decaying, partially overgrown New York City is visually arresting and believable.  Apparently a lot of other people don't care for them, but, personally, I'm ok with how the vampire-zombies look.  The deer, on the other hand, were an unwelcome distraction (I kept wondering whether they were some sort of zombie-deer because, well, they didn't look very much like deer).The DVD extras consist entirely of animated comics that take place in the world of I Am Legend parallel to the story of the film.  The comics are very artsy, emotionally gripping, and well written.  One in particular gives us a window into how the vampire-zombies see the world and surviving humans.

What I will rate is the 2-disc ""Special Edition"" of this movie.The 1st disc is no different than the single release. It contains the theatrical version of the movie and 4 animated comics: Death As a Gift, Isolation, Sacrificing the Few for the Many, and Shelter.The 2nd disc contains the movie as it was in the theater except for how it ends. I won't spoil it, but it adds about 4 minutes more and the ending is completely different from how it ends in the theatrical release. The 2nd disc also allows you to download a digital version of the movie to your computer or portable media device.Overall, I feel this 2-disc edition is not worth the extra money it costs. Why Warner Bros. couldn't just create a branching edition of the movie on the first disc seems to point towards corporate greed. But, I'm seeing this more and more on other releases where the 2nd DVD is nothing more than a way to purchase a digital version of the movie.

It's cheaper and you really aren't losing out on the alternate ending which really isn't controversial at all.However, due to the lack of special features (making of documentary, etc) and the cheap attempt at charging more money by supplying a different cut of the movie on a separate disc as well as to download a digital version of the movie, this 2-disc release gets a 1 star.

Yet it did not fulfill its promises. One more survival film, you will say. Maybe but I am afraid it is more serious than that. One more epidemic film. Yes for sure, but yet it is deeper than that. One more zombie and living dead film then. Absolutely, but the disappointment comes from farther than that. The film uses three very common forms and it could have intertwined them and twisted them in a new creative way. But with one character and a dog, you do not go that far. In fact it is the whole argument of Stephen King's The Stand. The super flu, the dying of everyone, the survival of a few. But Stephen King remains human and the two antagonistic camps are human survivors and then they represent the two opposite impulses of the human species: to fight and kill to survive against others, and to organize collectively to survive with others. In this film the survivors are good humans and all the others are bad mutants. Badness in man is thus not human but antihuman. That is very nave indeed, especially when we understand the epidemic was caused by the irresponsible experiments of one doctor on thousands of people with genetically manipulated viruses. It is this vision of good humans attacked from outside by some who are no longer human at all that makes the film poor and even weak. Evil is not outside. Evil is inside. Anyone who says the reverse is just a blind man. Then the plot is no plot because we know what it is going to be. There is no surprise and no psychological death. And the dramatic events here and there are defused by too much disbelief to suspend. How did the woman arrive in Manhattan, how did she escape the house, how did she drive out of Manhattan, how did she know where to go? And many other questions like those. Then the legend becomes a fable and a weak one at that.

A bunch of zombie movies started springing up all over the place (Dawn of Dead remake, 28 days, Shaun of Dead, etc), but I never heard anything about Omega Man again---until, I heard that they WERE actually going to do it, but now call it by its original title, I Am Legend, and the biggest box office star in the world, Will Smith, would be the lead.  If they would have made this film back during Arnold's heyday, I think it would have been successful.  But, later on, not so much, BUT, with Smith in it right now there is no doubt this movie will be a huge moneymaker.  The comparisons to Omega Man with one of my all-time favorites Charlton Heston?  Well, I like that the ""creatures"" are more intelligent in Omega Man, not just pure monsters out for food.  I think most people agree that out of Heston's ""post-apocolyptic sci-fi trilogy--Planet Apes, Soylent Green, and Omega) Omega hasn't weathered as well.  But, I think some of the best scenes in Legend are almost taken directly from Omega Man.  The driving alone through the deserted city, and some of the ""cracking up"" scenes with Heston, especially the telephone/booth scene is better that Smith freaking out about the empty city.  The ending scenes are quite powerful from both films, but I prefer Heston's ending as well.  So, I guess if you like scary/horror/action films, you should check out Legend.

The only similarity pretty much is that the main character is named Robert Neville.  There's a few others such as he broadcasts for others to meet him at a peer if there is anyone else alive but 99% of this film has nothing to do with the masterpiece novelI Am Legend.  Plus the 1% that is such as his apartment has reinforced shutter roller doors and other defences built in aren't relevant as we find out the vampires (and I'm just assuming they are vampires as that's what they were in the book but these things in the movie look more like something from The Mummy or Lord of the Rings, I guess we know why they didn't show them in the previews ie they were too embarrassed) don't even know where he lives and aren't as the main part of the book (which influenced many as subsequent living dead zombie film) attacking his home every night.Some changes from the book obviously don't matter such Robert no longer being a blue eyed blond haired guy (although this would have been a great challenge and opportunity to fully test Will Smith's acting abilities) but the whole reason why Robert Neville was a legend in the book not being so in the film is simply unforgivable.  I mean that is the title of the book, the whole realisation of why he's a legend in the novel is the whole point of the title.  This film's reason, is poor and just unforgivable.Great acting by the dog but it should have appeared much later in the film as it did in the novel which made way more sense and highlighted emotion of finding out your not the last living thing on the planet.Even if you are someone who doesn't care that the plot has no similarities to the original book you have to acknowledge the serious holes in the plot line.

Have lions gone cool there are no humans alive in North America I think I will go for a swim across the Atlantic Ocean from Africa and live there now?  For that matter how did the creepy woman and kid get onto the island of Manhattan, and what's with the religious propaganda - ""God told me where to go."" Did the film makers get confused and start thinking they were doing a movie of Stephen King'sThe Standfor a while or something?  Plus where does will Smith get the electricity from to power his apartment and lab and play the blatant Shrek product placement promotion which took the valuable screen time place of could have included many cool scenes from the book?

657187,A2TT4AA3QO0DPY,B00005JPTK,Jay Young,"[1, 3]","I'll get straight to the point- if you've read the book and are expecting a faithful adaptation, you'll be disappointed. On the other hand, if you're expecting a good post-apocalyptic thriller, then you'll enjoy it.First, in response to what some other people have been saying, this is NOT a remake of ""The Omega Man."" This is a re-interpretation of the original book ""I am Legend."" It follows Richard Matheson's classic source material in its broad outlines. The human race has been decimated by a virus, and turned some of them into Nocturnal predators. Dr. Robert Neville, formerly a great Army doctor, may be the last man on earth and eeks out a living in deserted New York City. During the day, he gathers what food and supplies he can from stores and houses, and hunts deer. Neville has an alarm on his watch that goes off at a certain point in the day so that he knows when to return to his home. In addition, Neville has a lab in his basement with rats that have been infected with the virus, and injects them with various experimental serums in a desperate effort to find a cure to the virus. Neville's only companionship is his daughter's dog Samantha and news tapes from the time before the world went to hell. Before the sun goes down, Neville shuts his house up and sleeps with a gun to protect himself from the predators outside. One day while hunting deer, Samantha wanders into a dark building and Neville, frustrated, follows her. He then encounters a ""hive"" (as he calls them) of the creatures, and barely escapes with his life. Our hero then sets up a trap for one of the creatures so that he can capture one and test his serum on, and succeeds in his plan, though the serum appears not to be successful. Neville continues to struggle with his isolation, and begins to lose his sense of reality. He talks to the mannequins he has set up, pleading with them to talk back, and unfortunately falls into one of his own traps. Things take a turn for the worse after that, and I will stop the plot synopsis there.Will Smith does a good job in the lead role, despite the fact that many say he was miscast. As I mentioned earlier, the movie does not follow the book very closely, so purist fans of the book will be disappointed. Briefly, here are some of the differences:*The creatures in the book are definitely vampires, and in the movie they are simply nocturnal predators.*In the book, the vampires can talk and recognize people, whereas in the movie the creatures have lost all human higher brain functions.*In the book, the vampires are invulnerable to anything except a stake through the heart and sunlight. The creatures in the movie are still vulnerable to sunlight, but otherwise are as vulnerable as humans (even though they are much stronger).*The character Robert Neville in the book was not a doctor before the outbreak, or a scientist of any kind.*In the book, what turned people into vampires was a germ spread by mutant insects and dust storms after an implied nuclear war. In the movie, it's a virus that's the result of a cancer cure gone wrong.*The reasons for the title ""I am Legend"" are very different in the movie than the book.*The ending is not a complete cop-out, but is considerably more optimistic than the book's ending.There are other differences, but that list should give readers a good idea. ""I am Legend"" does offer enough for sci-fi/horror fans to be satisfied, however. For instance, there's definitely plenty of suspense, particularly when Neville follows his dog into a dark building and discovers a ""hive"" of the creatures.

Now, it's super strong mutants, products of a cancer treatment gone horribly wrong.  The bald mutants look very similar to the robots.""I Am Legend"" is a remake of a remake.  The original is ""The Last Man on Earth.""  Made in the sixties, this film most closely resembles the novel on which it was based:  Richard Matheson's  ""I Am Legend.""  An airborne virus kills most of the human population which return as zombie-like vampires.  Vincent Price is Dr. Neville who's lost his family to the virus and searches for a cure while killing vampires in London.In the early seventies, Charlton Heston reprises the role as Dr. Neville in ""The Omega Man.""  Living in Las Angeles, he also searches for a cure while killing the mutants.  Those who do not die from the germ warfare are turned into psychotic albinos who are afraid of the light.Of the three movie, ""The Omega Man"" is superior because it has the most realistic plot and the better characterization.  The mutants are three-dimensional humans; they are not cartoon characters.  Neville has more interaction with the unaffected survivors, especially one female played by feisty Rosalind Cash.  There are also more twists and turns.  It has a delicious, downbeat ending that leaves us with a faint ray of hope for mankind.In ""I Am Legend,"" Will Smith is basically a one man show; it is him versus the cartoon characters.  The interaction between him and the dog is touching and very emotional.  However, I felt more sympathy with Vincent Price's Neville who watched his family slowly die of the plague.  He even encountered his wife's return as a vampire.Overall, ""I Am Legend"" is entertaining and suspenseful.  However, it is a disappointment for fans of the far more superior ""Omega Man.""  I strongly suggest that, if you liked ""I Am Legend,"" you obtain a copy of ""The Omega Man.""  You may enjoy it more.  If you are a fan of classic horror and/or Vincent Price, search out a copy of ""The Last Man on Earth.""",4,"""I Am Legend"" Is Entertaining But ""The Omega Man"" Is Superior",1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,2082,"['Will', 'Smith', 'stars', 'yet', 'again', 'film', 'where', 'animated', 'creatures', 'First', 'was', 'runaway', 'robots', 'Robot', 'Now', 'super', 'strong', 'mutants', 'products', 'cancer', 'treatment', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'bald', 'mutants', 'look', 'very', 'similar', 'robots', 'Am', 'Legend', 'remake', 'remake', 'original', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'Made', 'sixties', 'film', 'most', 'closely', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Am', 'Legend', 'airborne', 'virus', 'most', 'human', 'population', 'return', 'zombie-like', 'vampires', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Dr.', 'Neville', 'who', 'lost', 'family', 'virus', 'searches', 'cure', 'killing', 'vampires', 'London.In', 'early', 'seventies', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Neville', 'Omega', 'Man', 'Living', 'Las', 'Angeles', 'also', 'cure', 'killing', 'mutants', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'die', 'germ', 'warfare', 'are', 'turned', 'psychotic', 'albinos', 'who', 'are', 'afraid', 'light.Of', 'three', 'movie', 'Omega', 'Man', 'superior', 'most', 'realistic', 'plot', 'better', 'characterization', 'mutants', 'are', 'three-dimensional', 'humans', 'are', 'not', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'Neville', 'more', 'interaction', 'unaffected', 'survivors', 'especially', 'one', 'female', 'played', 'feisty', 'Rosalind', 'Cash', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'twists', 'turns', 'delicious', 'downbeat', 'ending', 'faint', 'ray', 'hope', 'mankind.In', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Will', 'Smith', 'basically', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'interaction', 'dog', 'touching', 'very', 'emotional', 'However', 'felt', 'more', 'sympathy', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Neville', 'who', 'watched', 'family', 'slowly', 'die', 'plague', 'even', 'encountered', 'wife', 'return', 'vampire.Overall', 'Am', 'Legend', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'However', 'disappointment', 'fans', 'far', 'more', 'superior', 'Omega', 'Man', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'liked', 'Am', 'Legend', 'obtain', 'copy', 'Omega', 'Man', 'may', 'enjoy', 'more', 'are', 'fan', 'classic', 'horror', 'and/or', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'search', 'out', 'copy', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth']",I Am Legend

He is left alone, his family and friends dead or worse, with just his dog and some mannequins for company.  What that means is that Dr. Neville (Will Smith) has to carry the story himself and he does so very well.  He displays a wide range of emotion throughout the film, making the viewer laugh and cry and ultimately sympathize with the plight of the last man on earth who just can't help but hope against hope that he can undo what has happened and redeem mankind.If I had to point out gripes about the movie the two that come to mind  are the CGI Vampire/Zombies and the rushed and too coincidental feel of the latter part of the film.

I never read the book that inspired this movie, but I am a Will Smith fan and he delivered again in this movie.  I seen the movie in the theater and bought the DVD...so why the 3 star rating?  The problem set I Am Legend presented was very intriguing to me; however, I don't buy into the idea of super human zombie's or any scenario where a person's physiology is suddenly altered.  But...Society is very dependent on infrastructure; in this movie the main character is surviving in an environment not devastated by manmade or natural destruction; what's left I Am Legend is a world that still appears the same but without human presence.  Watching Smith recover and use the resources available and/or left behind, and his way of dealing with isolation from human interaction was appealing.  I would have rated the movie higher if it had invested more time building Smiths character and showing his quest for survival day in and day out.  Instead, it breezed over this aspect leaving holes in the plot...and in the end I was left wanting more.  I have heard that a sequel is in the works and has Will Smith signed on to it; it will supposedly explore what happened leading up to where this movie started.

You think he is justified to do so. At the end, when he is caught. You realize with him that in fact, HE IS the monster. Not them. To the vampires, he is the BOOGEY MAN.

The virus has a 90% kill rate, and the military is moving to evacuate people from New York City.  Neville rushes his wife and daughter to a waiting helicopter, but he remains in the city; determined to find a cure for the rabid disease.  Neville himself is immune from the virus, but most are not.  To make matters worse, the military has decided to quarantine Manhattan, and soon, bridges are being blasted to prevent infected people from escaping.  Neville only has Sam, his pet German Shepard, as a companion.Neville spends his days foraging and his nights working on a cure for the virus, using his own immune blood as a component to the vaccine.  He is also forced to deal with the Infected; mutated vampire-like zombies who are roaming the deserted streets of New York in search of prey.  He has also sent out radio messages trying to attract other immune people to come and join him.  He offers food, shelter, and safety to any immune person who can reach him.One encounter with the Infected leaves Sam near death.  Neville takes his beloved dog home to try to save him, but Sam begins exhibiting traits like the Infected.  Sadly, Neville puts Sam down himself.  However, he isn't alone for long, as a young woman and child show up unexpectedly at his house.  She explains that God brought her to Robert's house, but he is skeptical.  Meanwhile, Robert has been experimenting on one of the Infected that he managed to capture and bring back to his house.  By using his own blood, it appears that the effects of the virus are being reversed, but it might be too late for Robert and his companions, as the other Infected have tracked Robert to his home.  Soon, the others break into the house and begin searching for Robert.  Will he survive, or will the Infected succeed in disposing of him?This is a first-rate thriller.  Will Smith gives one of his best performances since ""Independence Day"" as the dedicated Dr. Neville.  The special effects are excellent as well.  It was somewhat scary looking at a deserted New York City, with weeds growing in the cracks of sidewalks and streets.  Watching lions hunt deer in the city was definitely strange, too.I rate this movie very highly.

657199,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JPTK,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[7, 9]","I was really looking forward to seeing ""I Am Legend"", from the moment I found out earlier this year. In preparation to seeing the movie, I watched Vincent Price in ""The Last Man on Earth"" and Charlton Heston in ""The Omega Man"". Even though the main ideas of the two prior versions were the same (last man, virus, night creatures, etc.), the delivery varied for their particular time. So I was intrigued to see how the storyline would be adapted to our time.The first thing that struck me was the set. Growing up in New York City, it really hit me hard to see the devastation and isolation of the city that ""Never Sleeps"". The streets, the abandoned cars, the bridges, the U.N.,etc. It really hit home. Then we see a much slender, leaner Will Smith trying to cope with the fact that he was alone. His portrayal of Robert Neville is great. Very moving. I find the origin of the virus quite interesting as it comes as a side effect for a cure for cancer. The prior two movies used a plague (The Last Man on Earth) and germ warfare (The Omega Man) to explain the virus. The use of a cure that transforms into a virus gives it an ironic twist.The film opens well, and continues that way until the introduction of the other two human characters, but that's about an hour or more of Smith, alone in Manhattan after a genetically-altered version of the measles has either killed or mutated the rest of humanity into super-violent creatures who prey on those unaffected, but only at night. They're killed almost instantly when exposed to sunlight. Smith, playing Robert Neville, was an Army Lieutenant before the virus was unleashed three years prior, and he spends his lonely days walking and stalking on the grown-in streets of Manhattan with his dog, Sam. At night, he locks himself in his apartment and attempts to find a cure. It's interesting seeing Smith carry the movie with only himself, Sam, some various wild animal species, and some mannequins. He does an excellent job, and I'm sure that's not an easy task for an actor. This is easily the most likable character he's ever played, and he brings a lot of great stuff to it, including humor and a scene that had me on the verge of tears.Will Smith and the strength of the story outweigh the two mot glaringly bad things about this film. However, the creature effects are WAY too over-reliant on CGI, but then again, so are most horror films these days, so you might be used to it. Animatronics and foam rubber latex effects pioneered well over thirty years ago look a lot more believable than this cartoonish junk. And the other thing is the ending.  It's not terrible, and it won't make you dislike the rest of the film, but the original story's ending is very sad and ironic, and this, like the other two adaptations, just can't seem to cope with the magnitude of the situation, so they always leave you with something WAY to hopeful for what we've seen throughout the rest of the film, and also, it seems that they're afraid to teach you the incredible lesson the original Matheson story had to offer. This is a good adaptation of Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend.' So far, none of the three have nailed it, due to the inability to just use the story's ending, but this one comes close and is certainly one of the best of the three (the other two are good flicks so I recommend them all).",4,"3.5--Three Times A ""Legend""",1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,3342,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Am', 'Legend', 'moment', 'found', 'out', 'earlier', 'year', 'preparation', 'seeing', 'movie', 'watched', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Omega', 'Man', 'Even', 'main', 'ideas', 'two', 'prior', 'versions', 'were', 'same', 'last', 'man', 'virus', 'night', 'creatures', 'etc', 'delivery', 'varied', 'particular', 'time', 'So', 'was', 'intrigued', 'see', 'how', 'storyline', 'would', 'be', 'adapted', 'time.The', 'first', 'thing', 'struck', 'was', 'set', 'Growing', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'really', 'hit', 'hard', 'see', 'devastation', 'isolation', 'city', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'streets', 'abandoned', 'cars', 'bridges', 'U.N.', 'etc', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'Then', 'see', 'much', 'slender', 'leaner', 'Will', 'Smith', 'trying', 'cope', 'fact', 'was', 'alone', 'portrayal', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'great', 'Very', 'moving', 'find', 'origin', 'virus', 'quite', 'interesting', 'side', 'effect', 'cure', 'cancer', 'prior', 'two', 'movies', 'used', 'plague', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'warfare', 'Omega', 'Man', 'explain', 'virus', 'use', 'cure', 'virus', 'ironic', 'twist.The', 'film', 'well', 'way', 'introduction', 'other', 'two', 'human', 'characters', 'hour', 'more', 'Smith', 'alone', 'Manhattan', 'genetically-altered', 'version', 'measles', 'either', 'killed', 'mutated', 'rest', 'humanity', 'super-violent', 'creatures', 'who', 'prey', 'unaffected', 'only', 'night', ""'re"", 'killed', 'almost', 'instantly', 'when', 'exposed', 'sunlight', 'Smith', 'playing', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'was', 'Army', 'Lieutenant', 'virus', 'was', 'unleashed', 'three', 'years', 'prior', 'lonely', 'days', 'walking', 'stalking', 'grown-in', 'streets', 'Manhattan', 'dog', 'Sam', 'night', 'apartment', 'attempts', 'find', 'cure', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'Smith', 'carry', 'movie', 'only', 'Sam', 'various', 'wild', 'animal', 'species', 'mannequins', 'excellent', 'job', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'actor', 'easily', 'most', 'likable', 'character', 'ever', 'played', 'lot', 'great', 'stuff', 'including', 'humor', 'scene', 'had', 'verge', 'tears.Will', 'Smith', 'strength', 'story', 'outweigh', 'two', 'mot', 'glaringly', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'However', 'creature', 'effects', 'are', 'WAY', 'too', 'over-reliant', 'CGI', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'are', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'days', 'might', 'be', 'used', 'Animatronics', 'foam', 'rubber', 'latex', 'effects', 'pioneered', 'well', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'look', 'lot', 'more', 'believable', 'cartoonish', 'junk', 'other', 'thing', 'ending', 'not', 'terrible', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'dislike', 'rest', 'film', 'original', 'story', 'ending', 'very', 'sad', 'ironic', 'other', 'two', 'adaptations', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'cope', 'magnitude', 'situation', 'always', 'leave', 'something', 'WAY', 'hopeful', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'rest', 'film', 'also', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'teach', 'incredible', 'lesson', 'original', 'Matheson', 'story', 'had', 'offer', 'good', 'adaptation', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Am', 'Legend', 'So', 'far', 'none', 'three', 'have', 'nailed', 'due', 'inability', 'just', 'use', 'story', 'ending', 'one', 'close', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'three', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'good', 'flicks', 'so', 'recommend']",I Am Legend

657202,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00005JPTK,J from NY,"[1, 1]","Everyone seemed disappointed in this movie (probably because it takes a pretty high attention span to really get into).  Another reviewer commented that it ""doesn't stick closely to its' source material"", and in a way this is true, but it in a way it isn't--the film is pretty grim and though the ending strays from the novel, it is not a disappointment.Richard Matheson was so displeased with the first version of his classic horror novel of the same name (""The Last Man On Earth"" starring Vincent Price) that he changed his name on the film's credits to ""Logan Swanson"".  One can only imagine what he thought of Charlton Heston's ""The Omega Man"", which featured zombies with afros and sunglasses.  Both of these films, however, conveyed the sense of crushing loneliness which comes through in the novel (particularly the former).  I'm not sure it's possible to successfully adopt this book to screen without departing in some way from the author's uncompromising vision.Will Smith does a fantastically understated job as the unfortunate scientist Robert Neville, who seems to be the sole surviving member of the human race after a pernicious virus simultaneously wipes out the species and transforms them into degraded, parasitic creatures not dissimilar to mythological vampires.  Along with his dog Sam, he cruises around during the day and hides in his fortress-like apartment while they roam the streets looking for him.  The tension in this film is palpable enough to cut with a knife; the scene in which Sam unwisely runs into a very dark area, thereby sparking a confrontation between Neville and his once human foes, is nail biting and effective.  Smith brings across the psychical damage wrought by years of solitude and fear when he tearfully begs a mannequin to say hello to him, almost with the glimmer of a belief that it might indeed happen.  In nearly every way it is faithful to some of the most heart-wrenching events of the novel: Sam's transformation, for instance, into a rabid dog and what Neville has to do afterward.The irony of Neville being a feared, monstrous being from the perspective of these creatures and his natural inclinaton to see them the same way is not brought across with as much force as it was in ""The Last Man"" but nonetheless it is delivered powerfully.  Smith's Neville ""donates his blood"" (no pun intended) while igniting a grenade in a gesture of self-sacrifice that is not candy coated.  In some ways this is one of the best versions of the novel I have ever seen, and kudos to Will Smith for a great performance.",4,"Surprisingly excellent addition to the ""Legend"" trilogy",1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,2562,"['Everyone', 'seemed', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'probably', 'pretty', 'high', 'attention', 'span', 'really', 'get', 'reviewer', 'commented', ""n't"", 'stick', 'closely', 'source', 'material', 'way', 'true', 'way', ""n't"", 'film', 'pretty', 'grim', 'ending', 'strays', 'novel', 'not', 'disappointment.Richard', 'Matheson', 'was', 'so', 'displeased', 'first', 'version', 'classic', 'horror', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'starring', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'changed', 'name', 'film', 'credits', 'Logan', 'Swanson', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'thought', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Omega', 'Man', 'featured', 'zombies', 'afros', 'sunglasses', 'films', 'however', 'conveyed', 'sense', 'crushing', 'loneliness', 'novel', 'particularly', 'former', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'possible', 'successfully', 'adopt', 'book', 'screen', 'departing', 'way', 'author', 'uncompromising', 'vision.Will', 'Smith', 'fantastically', 'understated', 'job', 'unfortunate', 'scientist', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'who', 'be', 'sole', 'surviving', 'member', 'human', 'race', 'pernicious', 'virus', 'simultaneously', 'out', 'species', 'transforms', 'degraded', 'parasitic', 'creatures', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'mythological', 'vampires', 'dog', 'Sam', 'day', 'hides', 'fortress-like', 'apartment', 'roam', 'streets', 'looking', 'tension', 'film', 'palpable', 'enough', 'cut', 'knife', 'scene', 'Sam', 'unwisely', 'very', 'dark', 'area', 'thereby', 'sparking', 'confrontation', 'Neville', 'once', 'human', 'foes', 'nail', 'biting', 'effective', 'Smith', 'psychical', 'damage', 'wrought', 'years', 'solitude', 'fear', 'when', 'tearfully', 'mannequin', 'say', 'hello', 'almost', 'glimmer', 'belief', 'might', 'indeed', 'happen', 'nearly', 'way', 'faithful', 'most', 'heart-wrenching', 'events', 'novel', 'Sam', 'transformation', 'instance', 'rabid', 'dog', 'what', 'Neville', 'do', 'afterward.The', 'irony', 'Neville', 'being', 'feared', 'monstrous', 'being', 'perspective', 'creatures', 'natural', 'inclinaton', 'see', 'same', 'way', 'not', 'brought', 'across', 'as', 'much', 'force', 'was', 'Last', 'Man', 'delivered', 'powerfully', 'Smith', 'Neville', 'blood', 'pun', 'intended', 'igniting', 'grenade', 'gesture', 'self-sacrifice', 'not', 'candy', 'coated', 'ways', 'one', 'best', 'versions', 'novel', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'kudos', 'Will', 'Smith', 'great', 'performance']",I Am Legend

The third movie release of Richard Matheson's horror classic,I Am Legend, this film stars Will Smith as a former military officer living in New York City in the year 2012, three years after a deadly virus created to cure cancer mutated and decimated the worlds population, killing 90% of all human beings and transforming almost everyone else into blood thirsty zombie/vampire like creatures called ""night dwellers"" who come out only at night because UV rays from the sun burn their skin.Will Smith is the last man on earth, his only companion being his family dog named Samantha, or Sam for short, and manikins at the movie rental store that he likes to talk to. He goes though the ""Cast Away"" effect, like Tom Hank's character tries to remain sane by talking to a volleyball, Will Smith talks to manikins. the most stunning aspect of this film is the city itself; a deserted Time Square, overgrown with weeds and taken over by deer and escaped lions, is pretty creepy but unfortunately for this film 28 Days Later outdid it years ago with its deserted London, shot on location without using special effects. Anybody familiar with zombie movies have seen dozens of deserted cities as good or better before, whether it is from the 28 series or Romero's Living Dead series. I Am Legend, although impressive, is hardly groundbreaking in this area.while the city effects are good, the main focus of this movie is how Will Smith deals with being the last man left alive. a military man at heart, he goes though a rigid routine every day, exercising with his dog in the morning, working in his lab trying to find a cure, making his radio broadcast at noon and hoping someone will answerer, and then spending the rest of the day hunting and gathering supplies. At night, when the night dwellers roam the streets, he returns home where his home transforms into a fortress, and falls asleep in the bathtub. Then, next day, he does the same thing. his tests for a cure drive him to seek out human specimens every now and then, so like in Romero'sDay of the Dead (Divimax Special Edition)he captures zombies, brings them into his basement, and tries to cure them, more often killing them then helping.Unfortunately the movie never has a real sense of focus. does it want to be a character drama that keeps the zombies in the background and highlights the characters loneliness and despair like Night of the Living Dead, or does it want to be a classic shoot em up zombie movie like Resident Evil or 28 Weeks Later? It never makes up its mind, and in the end does both poorly. there isn't enough character depth to make this a great character drama, for that it needed to be at least twenty if not thirty minutes longer, and it doesn't have anywhere near enough action to make it a shoot out film; actually there is very little in the way of action. Social commentary is none existent as well, giving this film absolutely nothing to set it apart from other zombie/horror/virus movies from this year, or any other year. its lack of originality and depth makes almost guarantees this movie to go the way of other I Am Legend movie adoptionsThe Last Man on EarthandThe Omega Man. It will make its million dollars, and end up in discount bins five years from now.

I really like and look up to will smith.  He has been good since he first stared being seen and heard.  I saw this had gotten a few reviews of like 7.9 and 65%, but I like to judge movies myself and not just read something may not be good and shut it off.  My mother and I went to see this movie and it started at 12pm.  After all the crap they make you watch before the movie actually starts, let us say the movie started at 12:15.  I looked at my cell and it was 1.19pm.  I thought ""holy man"" this movie is going by SO fast and it has been good so far.  Then, it happened.  For the rest of the movie it dragged on and on and on.  When we left we talked about it on the way home or wear ever we were going.  There was so much that was unexplained in the film.Now for the break down.  The movie was about a lady who had found a cure for cancer.  She was telling how many thousands of people were going to get to use the trials.  Then you see the world sometime later and it's deserted.  There is one man and a dog.  Now you would think that a movie with a man and a dog would get boring.  But it did not.  At first.  It turns out that smiths character was a scientist.  He was stll trying to find a cure for the disease even when he thought no one was alive.  There were humans left but they had gotten sick from the drug that the lady had made.  Here was one of the problems.  They made the people look like aliens or monsters.  I understand if they get sick and look all bug eyed.  But these things looked like they came from another planet.  Later in the movie, (when these ""creatures"" were chasing smith) he was on like the 3rd or 4th floor.  They started climbing up the damn walls.  Just scaling outside walls with nothing to hold onto.  The movie did not explain how or why the hell these ""HUMANS,"" ""who were supposed to have only gotten sick from a new medicine.""  Could climb up walls.  They showed the faces of these things a few times and they made them look like they knew they were evil and trying to kill people.  So that was strange and got me thinking.  Then it never really explained how smiths character was immune to the virus.  So now you are left thinking about two pretty important things.  Don't you all worry, because these are not the only things that made me give this a 2.  Then there's smiths dog.  Cretin animals were immune to the air born virus but not if they were bitten.  Never explained this, nor did they mention why the sickened people had turned into what looks like vampires (because if they bite you, you would get the virus) or zombies (because the way they looked and walked.)  So after all this I said ""ok guess it will explain everything later on.""  The movie continued.  Smiths character had been putting out radio on am and finally he was knocked out and awoke with a woman and child helping him.  The lady said she had herd his message.  She said there was a bunch of people in a camp some wear.  Smith yelled and told her that there were no people.  She was going to go and leave him there.  Well in the end the zombie-pire-human type things had followed them to the place they were staying one night.  Did I mention that these human some how could not go into sunlight.  So they had to travel only at night?  So The evil hums started to get into the house and smith hid the lady and her sun, found a grenade and as soon as the zoms shattered the glass that was protecting him.  He threw it.  Killing himself and the zombies.  Then it shows the lady found the military base, with other people mind you and was safe.  She was talking about smiths character ""who she said was 50 something,"" they did a bad job of making him look as old as he was supposed to be had died saving the cure.  Even though he gave her the cure and died for nothing.  When the movie ends, you will more than likely be like UM.  Actually a man in the theater we were in said ""OK"" as I was walking out.  The movie was only like an hour and 40 minutes.  Perhaps if it had been longer like 2 hours and 40 minutes.  They could have explained more.  But this movie tried to be to many different kinds of movie.  If they had made it only about people getting sick and dying, and a man sill ok trying to find a cure.  It probably would have been better.  But there are so many unanswered questions and things that make no sense, that it is hard to enjoy.  I know I will never watch it again.

Matheson is (next to Lovecraft) the most important figure in horror in the twentieth century.  This famous book almost created the concept of ""the last real human left on Earth.""  In the book, it is vampires.  In the movies, they became ""mutants,"" or zombies, or ""the infected.""This film gives us monsters who are a cross between vampires and zombies.  They are like vampires because they cannot be exposed to sunlight.  Otherwise, they are like the zombies of the 28 Days Later mold - exceptionally fast and strong.  (I still have a problem with fast, strong zombies - where do they get their strength from, especially considering they are so under-nourished.  But perhaps I am being too literal.)This movie works because the filmmakers choose to use suspense over cheap shocks.  It is amazing how long it takes to even see one of the monsters.  Most of the film is about Will Smith trying (and failing) to hold onto his sanity as he wonders through the surreally empty Manhattan.There are flaws in the film to be sure - mostly, some badly done CGI effects.  All in all, it works.  It is about time this film was made.  For years, it has been kicking around Hollywood attached to people like Schwarzenegger and so on.

657235,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JPTK,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 2]","I am a fan of Will Smith, I enjoy watching his movies and generally speaking they never disappoint me, and to an extent I even enjoy some of his music (mostly just the songs he's done for the various movies he's starred in). When the initial posters for ""I Am Legend"" arrived in theaters and listed the name Will Smith I was already psyched to see it, even though based on the posters I thought the name was the way too long ""The Last Man on Earth is Not Alone"", but it turned out that was just the tagline, but I still maintain that was a strange marketing strategy by not making the film's title readily visible. Anyways, when the trailers began showing up on the internet and on television I became even more pumped for the movie because it just looked really interesting and cool, and I was intrigued by the fact that based on the previews I still had no clue what exactly Will's character was up against, only that he was the last surviving member of humanity (to his knowledge) and he's fighting for survival against some monstrous person or group of people. So, the movie was released to theaters, I didn't go see it, go figure since I don't see a whole lot of films at the theaters these days, partly because of time and the other is the ever-increasing cost of ticket prices, I just find it easier to wait the extra few months for the DVD release and watch it on my widescreen TV in the comfort of my own home. Finally, it was released to DVD, and after all the various criticisms I had heard, along with some praise, though it seemed like not as many people liked the movie compared to those that disliked it to some degree or just flat-out hated it; I was still interested in seeing the movie and I must say I was not disappointed in the least.""I Am Legend"" takes place in the year 2012, as mankind has been essentially wiped out by a deadly virus meant to cure cancer. In place of mankind are these monstrous, mutated beings who are similar to vampires due to their affinity for darkness, sensitivity to light, their attraction to blood, and because they can infect others with their `vampirism' as it were; however, they are not vampires or even zombies for that matter, they are merely mutated and diseased humans who have taken over New York City and possibly the rest of the world. At night they are in charge, but during the day one lone man prowls the streets, Robert Neville (Will Smith) who along with his trusty German Shepherd, Sam, has NYC all to themselves. Robert is a former military virologist who is trying desperately to develop a cure for the disease that he is somehow immune to, while at the same time trying to keep his sanity and hold onto some small sliver of hope that there may possibly be other human survivors out there waiting to be found.After watching ""I Am Legend"" I can see why some people may have not liked the movie as much as most of Will Smith's previous efforts, because prior to its release no one really knew what to expect from the movie. So, the fact that essentially 85% percent of the movie consists of either Will Smith on screen by himself or with his dog, and no one else to really interact with, could really turn some people off to the overall experience of the movie. In my case, I knew what to expect going into watching the movie, so Will Smith having to act by himself on screen a majority of the time didn't bother me at all, and I was truly impressed by how good he did and just how captivating he made the character of Robert. I believe that even if I hadn't known what to expect in terms of whether there would be other actors featured prominently or just having Will by himself for a majority of the film, I still would have enjoyed the movie all the same.The story for ""I Am Legend"" is very well-paced and well-written by screenwriters Mark Protosevich (""Poseidon"") and Akiva Goldsman (""I, Robot"") based on a novel by Richard Matheson. They imbue the story with such heart, intense drama, and a tense, eerie atmosphere that you are instantly drawn into the plight of this lone man roaming the streets searching for a way to survive and to fix past mistakes, and in the end cure the disease that has ravaged the world. I appreciated the way the writers tried to show Robert's mental state as being somewhat disconnected from reality, by having him set up mannequins throughout the city for him to interact with as if they were real people. Also, the connection between Robert and his dog Sam was very genuine and natural, serving as an almost bittersweet connection to Robert's past and the family that he's lost along the way. Many people praised Will Smith for his powerful performance in this movie given the challenge of having to act by himself, and he is completely deserving of any praise he receives for his work here, but by the same token, I would think some praise should go to the writers for being able to craft such an engaging story focusing on one man and his dog, without really being able to rely on dialogue or any kind of interaction with other characters. This is a brilliant job on behalf of the writers and even the novelist, for being able to keep an audiences' attention every step of the way without the usual tools at their disposal for propelling a story onward.From an acting standpoint, there is really only one person to talk about and that's Will Smith, and as I've alluded to somewhat already he did an exemplary job with the role of Robert Neville. Will is a magnetic presence onscreen in every movie I've seen him in, but normally he's able to play off of other actors in the scene, but here he's pretty much on his own or with a dog, aside from a few key flashbacks that shed some light on his previous life before the virus struck, so his ability is definitely worthy of praise. An incredible performance for Will, and one that I'm sure wasn't nearly as easy as some of his other past performances might have been, but he handled the isolation onscreen very well, and conveyed the characters deep sense of loss in a way that was very natural yet didn't make the character seem suicidal or depressed, which would have most likely not played well with most audiences, just desperate which was very appropriate for the circumstances Robert has found himself in.""I Am Legend"" is a very entertaining movie that remains engaging from start to finish even though the focus is primarily on Will Smith and his dog, and not much else. Director Francis Lawrence (""Constantine"") has really knocked it out of the park with this movie; he's definitely come along way from shooting music videos for MTV. Some have likened this movie to Tom Hanks' survivalist film ""Castaway"" due to his character being alone on an island except for a volleyball named Wilson as a companion. I can see the similarity between the two movies in that both movies featured a lead actor who was forced to act by himself for a majority of the film, but that's pretty much where the similarities end. Unlike ""Castaway"" which was a good movie, but not great, I feel ""I Am Legend"" is a great movie and one I will watch more than once. This movie isn't for everybody, but if you kind of know what you're going into prior to seeing the movie, you may end up enjoying it more, no guarantees though.""I Am Legend"" is rated PG-13 for

657239,AFRZL05D54MPM,B00005JPTK,JWolf,"[2, 2]","This is a good movie, highly unlikely and sad at times, but it's an original. The film is based on the book ""I Am Legend"", a science-fictiony, thriller/horrorish novel. My adjectives aren't great, but basically the story follows Robert Neville, a lieutenant colonel and virologist through post-apocalyptic struggles.In the beginning of the movie, a news clip is shown where a doctor is interviewed saying she believes the cure for cancer has been found, and has so far killed all cancer in over 1000 patients. A few months later, it seems that the virus used to kill cancer in these subjects has actually taken over their bodies; increased aggression is one of the many side effects that constitute a condition best described as evil-zombieism. The virus also spreads from person to person, but fortunately for Robert Neville, he appears to be one of few or none immune to the virus.For some time the government puts it's too scientists to work on a cure, but when the outbreak surges a cure has not been found. Neville and his family live in New York, where the bridges are to be blown for quarantine purposes. He says goodbye to his wife, daughter, and her puppy, Sam, as they are loaded into a helicopter to be taken from the island. Robert stats behind to concentrate on finding a cure, and at the last minute his daughter hands him Sam to keep him company. It's a good thing because soon he will be the only human left in Manhattan as the city is taken over by zombies.Over the next few years, Robert and Sam have a routine they practice which includes foraging, hunting, searching for survivors and searching for a cure, as well as protecting themselves against the horrors in the shadows. While the movie is horror in genre, it is also quite tragic. Neville falls deeper into the sorrow of pain and loss and loneliness. Will Smith does an excellent job of understating the mental trauma Neville experiences, but expresses it in a way that feels very real. For the remainder of the film, the search for a cure continues as the threat of death by zombie nears. I won't ruin any surprises but I really think this is a good movie, but be aware that it is very very sad and not easily shrugged away.

Each is campy and fun, updated for its own time.  I expected the same from this:  another fun zombie movie.  I was quite mistaken.Although not a die hard fan of Will Smith, I am in awe of his stellar performance in this movie.  It is basically a one man show, and Smith hands-down proves he has the talent and screen presence to successfully pull it off.  It is a riveting performance; one in which Smith lives up to his potential as a cinematic leading man.  His emotions are realistic and run the gauntlet:  anger, humor, hope, love, caring, despair, shock, loneliness, fear. He does it all and leaves you believing.The cinematography of a deserted New York is outstanding, both oddly beautiful and action packed.  The opening sequences grab you and glue you to your seat.  The scenes of Smith hunting on the streets of NYC really drive home just how alone he is.The infected, the CGI vampires, actually made my skin crawl.  All the effects were well done, and allowed the viewer to successfully suspend his disbelief.Overall, this is a great film.  It still affected me days after I had seen it.

657242,AW3I97UR8NP7T,B00005JPTK,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[3, 3]","Like every fan of the genre, I was looking forward to the new version of Richard Matheson's classic I AM LEGEND. I've read the book many times and I've seen both THE LAST MAN ON EARTH and THE OMEGA MAN  too many times to count.This was probably a bad thing, I thought. It was going to be difficult for any film to live up to the kind of expectations you have with that kind of background. I wished I was one of those lucky people who would be going in cold and be able to just judge it on its own merits.Yep, that would have helped, because towards the end the film makers lost their focus, got sloppy and frankly confused some of us who are familair with the book.Up until then, however, they were doing a wonderful job! The up-dating to the new century was smooth and forgiveable, the device that sets the plague and the plot in motion was slick and logical. Will Smith gave a touching performance as a man in complete isolation. I just hated those lousy computer generated vampires! And there weren't enough of them considering how many people had fallen to the plague.Maybe one day there will be a perfect adaptation of I AM LEGEND, probably not since perfection is subjective. Until then this is pretty damned close.Especially if you've seen THE OMEGA MAN!Time has passed since my initial viewing of this film and I've been able to reconsider things in the harsh light of day. And I'm afraid that the sad truth is that this is a seriously flawed film that is carried only by the strong performance of its star. There are far too many questions that the viewer is left with afterwards: like how did the woman get on the island?  How did she get off? Remember the bridges and tunnels had all been destroyed long ago. If even 90% of the population had been turned into vampires there should have been a lot more of them then that, there seemed to be only a couple hundred vampires in all of New York City, even with computer generation. Why doesn't Neville ever monitor his radio to see if anyone is sending messages like he does in the book? Then he too might have learned of the safezone, it would have made sense for him to do that. And it would have made sense for him to do his lab work at night rather than as part of his day routine, those winter nights can be pretty long in the north and you wouldn't want to waste all your scavenging and hunting time doing stuff you could be doing at night. That's the way he does it in the book. And speaking of the safezone in Vermont or New Hampshire or where ever, that has confused some of the people I've spoken to. They seemed to think that it was safe there because of the cold! Well, if that were the case, why not Canada? It would hardly be a worldwide plague if cold killed the virus. But in all fairness, the people with whom I spoken people live in Florida and can't relate to the concept of cold very well. And there are many more examples I could give. And they are all evidence of sloppy writing.In the end all of I AM LEGEND's serious flaws are caused by one thing; that is written by people who neither respect nor understand the genre in which they are working, and in the  retrospect it shows.I've been forced to lower my rating of it to a hesitant 3 stars.",4,SERIOUSLY FLAWED FLICK,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,3223,"['fan', 'genre', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'new', 'version', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'classic', 'AM', 'LEGEND', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'THE', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'ON', 'EARTH', 'THE', 'OMEGA', 'MAN', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'count.This', 'was', 'probably', 'bad', 'thing', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'difficult', 'film', 'live', 'up', 'kind', 'expectations', 'have', 'kind', 'background', 'wished', 'was', 'one', 'lucky', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'going', 'cold', 'be', 'able', 'just', 'judge', 'own', 'merits.Yep', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'end', 'film', 'makers', 'lost', 'focus', 'got', 'sloppy', 'frankly', 'confused', 'who', 'are', 'familair', 'book.Up', 'then', 'however', 'were', 'doing', 'wonderful', 'job', 'up-dating', 'new', 'century', 'was', 'smooth', 'forgiveable', 'device', 'plague', 'plot', 'motion', 'was', 'slick', 'logical', 'Will', 'Smith', 'gave', 'touching', 'performance', 'man', 'complete', 'isolation', 'just', 'hated', 'lousy', 'computer', 'generated', 'vampires', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'considering', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'fallen', 'plague.Maybe', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'adaptation', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'probably', 'not', 'perfection', 'subjective', 'then', 'pretty', 'damned', 'close.Especially', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'THE', 'OMEGA', 'MAN', 'Time', 'passed', 'initial', 'viewing', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'reconsider', 'things', 'harsh', 'light', 'day', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'sad', 'truth', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'film', 'carried', 'only', 'strong', 'performance', 'star', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'viewer', 'left', 'afterwards', 'how', 'did', 'woman', 'get', 'island', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'off', 'Remember', 'bridges', 'tunnels', 'had', 'been', 'destroyed', 'long', 'ago', 'even', '90', '%', 'population', 'had', 'been', 'turned', 'vampires', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'then', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'couple', 'hundred', 'vampires', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'even', 'computer', 'generation', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Neville', 'ever', 'monitor', 'radio', 'see', 'anyone', 'sending', 'messages', 'book', 'Then', 'too', 'might', 'have', 'learned', 'safezone', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'do', 'lab', 'work', 'night', 'rather', 'part', 'day', 'routine', 'winter', 'nights', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'long', 'north', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'scavenging', 'hunting', 'time', 'doing', 'stuff', 'could', 'be', 'doing', 'night', 'way', 'book', 'speaking', 'safezone', 'Vermont', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'where', 'ever', 'confused', 'people', ""'ve"", 'spoken', 'seemed', 'think', 'was', 'safe', 'there', 'cold', 'Well', 'were', 'case', 'why', 'not', 'Canada', 'would', 'hardly', 'be', 'worldwide', 'plague', 'cold', 'killed', 'virus', 'fairness', 'people', 'whom', 'spoken', 'people', 'live', 'Florida', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'concept', 'cold', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'examples', 'could', 'give', 'are', 'evidence', 'sloppy', 'end', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'serious', 'flaws', 'are', 'caused', 'one', 'thing', 'written', 'people', 'who', 'neither', 'respect', 'understand', 'genre', 'are', 'working', 'retrospect', 'shows.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'forced', 'lower', 'rating', 'hesitant', '3', 'stars']",I Am Legend
657243,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B00005JPTK,- Kasia S.,"[13, 19]","Usually I will read the book first but in this case seeing the trailer being played over and over stimulated my curiosity to the point of no return. Being a New Yorker made the whole experience really fun and interesting; recognizing sights I pass on my way to work every day with an eerie feeling of abandonment was something totally different. I would often think in my head about how crowded it gets and how I wish people would just go away but seeing it all empty and overgrowing with grass like a wild safari was worse than I could have imagined. I guess its better the way it is than suffering eternity alone the same way Robert Neville has.Alone except for the companionship of Samantha, the loyal German Shepherd, Neville is hunting wild deer and gathering food growing amok through the city while punctually seeking shelter as soon as the day light ends. When darkness approaches so do the mutated bodies that were once human but now reduced to vampire like creatures who savagely will hunt and devour any living creature. His only mission left is finding the cure than can turn the beasts back into the living before he goes mad form being alone. Things start going wrong when Neville stops being the hunter and starts becoming the hunted, the dark alleys that look ominous contain something that is keen ob bringing him down. His daily routing gets disturbed and he can no longer live peacefully with the hopes of one day saving everyone, he needs to find the cure fast or he too will succumb to the dire fate that all others have met.Visually stunning the movies makes you care for Neville, who was very well portrayed by Smith. He was alone but not overly distressed or crazed, he exercised, rented videos, cooked, watched Shrek and tried to stay as close to being sane as possible.

I went to the theaters as someone who:1.Had read the book, loved it and knew that Will Smith was probably not going to do an exact recreation of that book. That was fine by me. I can accept artistic license, in this case.2.Is a huge fan of Will Smith. I could probably listen to him read the phone book, name by name.3. Loves apocalyptic, vampire and similar movies, even some that others would consider cheesy, campy or just plain dumb.So there are my disclaimers, right up front. If you read on, you do so at your own risk...or because you have a similar mindset. But don't say I didn't warn you.I do suggest that you consider the fact that this book has been considered very hard to put on the screen - and rightly so, as far as I'm concerned. The book, a post-apocalyptic tale of one man surrounded by vampire types - is one of my favorites and I've read and reread it many times. However, I wondered how it'd work as a film adaptation.It isn't true to the book, not in the way a movie like To Kill A Mockingbird or The Yearling attempts to be true to the source material. Even so, I'd recommend this movie. I intend to see it again. Will Smith, generally very watchable on screen, doesn't disappoint and he reveals the unraveling of a man who is in the most desperate of circumstances, unhinged, not sure who is friend or foe or even the complete situation.Smith has the added challenge of appearing as a solo performer for a huge part of the film, a challenge in itself. He held my attention, utterly.Maybe I missed it but I never got the sense that the movie explained why or how there was an illness or disease that wiped out much of the world. Maybe a mutated virus? The cause isn't as important as the situation, a truly ghastly one, one man left amongst a group of vampirish types, crazy and demented.I couldn't keep my eyes off of Smith's face as he showed a range of emotions, reminding me that the man is an extremely talented actor. If you focus only on the accuracy of the translation of book to film, you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment but if you can let that go....and take this film for what it is...and accept the vision of the director and the acting talents of Smith, you'll be in for one wonderful ride (read my disclaimers above first).Also, I do have to note that the CG special effects bothered me some. I'm not a huge fan of those. Yet I still intend to see the film again, allowing my selective focus to hone in on the areas of the film I loved.I happened to really like 28 Days Later so this might be the type of film that fans of that movie would like, too.",4,"For the right target viewer, this works fine.

I do wish we'd seen more of the struggle of the main character when everyone was dying though. The story seemed to be broken into three parts, and not much was done to tie it all together. We did see flashbacks, but not enough to satisfy. I felt the editing was really choppy. There were some glaring omissions or at least ""what the heck"" momemnts that were just stuck in there.

A boat? how did they leave--?? why were the cars so shiny? lol) There were little touches I really loved in the film; the ""Shrek"" obsession, the dog, etc.The extras that show ""out takes"" prove to be really helpful and I think some should have been left in the movie.

Especially the ones that have a huge fan base that the fans really really love. Now, I never read I am legend but Will Smith is an amazing actor and one of the best, so I had to see this. I Am Legend is very simple, it almost even reminds you of Cast Away though there're more people or should I say creatures in this film.Robert Neville is a Virologist Lieutenant Colonel for the U.S. Army. In an early scene in the film you see Neville rushing his family into a car while the rest of N.Y. is running scared in a panic. While Neville is explaining to his wife and real life daughter Marley what is going on, a sort of zombie looking creature hits their car.  It turns out that there has been an outbreak spread of a very lethal virus. Then you come to find out that Neville is the last healthy person in New York City and maybe even the world. He may be the last person but he is surely not alone.First, I have no idea how Tom Hanks won for Cast Away and Smith doesn't receive anything. I say this because Will Smith just killed this role and if you don't believe me then just check it out. He is in the film by himself for most of its time but he your attention is never somewhere else. He honestly had me excited to see what would happen next. He even shows how hard it is to be by yourself for so long by making his dog his best friend and talking to a mannequin at a local video store.  His performance was flawless without a doubt. Without him, I don't see or think anyone else could have possibly played this role as well as him.I thought that the creatures were very cool, not extremely scary but cool. I think the creatures could shock a few but not many but at the same time they create great suspense. You never really know what they're going to do, I loved that these things were also intelligent. The creature intelligence almost remind you of the zombies from George A. Romero's Land of the Dead.  I thought I Am Legend was a great movie, some may like it and some may not. I know some people that saw the preview and thought that the movie was a horror but trust me its not.

I thought I had seen the bottom of the Smith barrel when Jaden lit up the screen in last year's homeless but not hopeless saga THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, but I had not reckoned that Will would put little Willow into a movie where vampires smash into limo windows trying to eat her!  Well, better her than another more impressionable child actor I guess.  Is this how Peter and Jane Fonda started out, widenings in their dad's demographic?  The little white boy who arrives in the present day is nothing to write home about however.  They never did explain to me where he'd come from, just told him to keep shuffling his food across his plate, from one end to the other, over and over, in an attempt to suggest some of the post traumatic stress of spending whole days with Alice Braga, niece of veteran Brazilian bombshell Sonia Braga, sadly missed in these days of ""the next generation.""More importantly the movie delivers plenty of action and suspense, till the last third where it all goes down the drain.  Director Francis Lawrence gets a wrenching performance out of his star, and the designers convincingly show us an apocalyptic and haunted, lonely New York, something Leonard Bernstein might have written symphonies about.SPOILERS AHEAD.Hate the emphasis on church in the picture, as the last reels dissolve into a debate between Will Smith and Alice Braga about does God exist or is He just an illusion or worse, out to get us.It was all very well in THE VILLAGE, but why repeat it here in the closing shots of I AM LEGEND.  Why do we have to see that church steeple, is it supposed to make us feel, OK, we're in good hands now?  Even in THE NEW WORLD, when John Smith returns to Jamestown and sees everyone dying of hunger, the church steeple is broken and battered.  Do the vampires of I AM LEGEND respect crucifixes the way vampires in Hammer horror do?  I wonder.

I have never read the book and I saw the Vincent Price version of this movie when I was very young. So, I came to this version with basically a clean slate. And I liked it.There are so many things I liked about it I don't know where to begin. The special effects were great, although a number of people dissed the CGI, I thought it worked well. The story follows a logical line for the situation, I liked that a lot too. Will Smith.... 'nuff said there.The first half and the second half of the movie did, for me at least, fit together. In his travels one day, Will Smith notices one of his mannequins where he did not place it. He is distraught and investigates. While he is investigating, he's pulled into a trap similar to one he used on one of the vampires. As evening closes in, his watch beeps and wakes him up. A battle ensues between him, his dog and the 'night seekers'. During the battle he's rescued by a stranger who takes him to his home unaware that the 'night seekers' watched and now know where he and she are. They come back later that evening for the final confrontation.So, there is a transition that takes place. It takes the movie from a peaceful but lonely route into a dangerous one. The vampires that Will Smith had been able to avoid can now locate him.The moral and ethical implications this film stirs up are tremendous. Scientific experimentation to cure cancer seems to have been the cause of the transformation in this story. That in itself brings up endless wagers and exhaustive arguments over right and wrong. Will Smith's character states 'God didn't do this. We did.' Placing the blame for the destruction of mankind onto mankind in a way that's different from other similar movies.Although this is not really a classic film, it is indeed a fine film and well worth watching. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or movies that can be debatable afterwards.",4,Really good movie,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,1984,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'disagree', 'lot', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'saw', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'version', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'So', 'came', 'version', 'basically', 'clean', 'slate', 'liked', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'liked', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'number', 'people', 'dissed', 'CGI', 'thought', 'worked', 'well', 'story', 'logical', 'line', 'situation', 'liked', 'lot', 'too', 'Will', 'Smith', 'said', 'there.The', 'first', 'half', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'did', 'least', 'fit', 'together', 'travels', 'one', 'day', 'Will', 'Smith', 'one', 'mannequins', 'where', 'did', 'not', 'place', 'distraught', 'investigates', 'investigating', 'pulled', 'trap', 'similar', 'one', 'used', 'one', 'vampires', 'evening', 'closes', 'watch', 'beeps', 'wakes', 'up', 'battle', 'dog', ""'night"", 'seekers', 'battle', 'rescued', 'stranger', 'who', 'home', 'unaware', ""'night"", 'seekers', 'watched', 'now', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'come', 'back', 'later', 'evening', 'final', 'confrontation.So', 'transition', 'place', 'movie', 'peaceful', 'lonely', 'route', 'dangerous', 'one', 'vampires', 'Will', 'Smith', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'avoid', 'can', 'now', 'locate', 'him.The', 'moral', 'ethical', 'implications', 'film', 'up', 'are', 'tremendous', 'Scientific', 'experimentation', 'cure', 'cancer', 'have', 'been', 'cause', 'transformation', 'story', 'up', 'endless', 'wagers', 'exhaustive', 'arguments', 'right', 'wrong', 'Will', 'Smith', 'character', 'states', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'did', 'Placing', 'blame', 'destruction', 'mankind', 'mankind', 'way', 'different', 'other', 'similar', 'not', 'really', 'classic', 'film', 'indeed', 'fine', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'debatable', 'afterwards']",I Am Legend

Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City...and maybe the world. But he is not alone. He is surrounded by ""the Infected"" -- victims of the plague who have mutated into carnivorous beings who can only exist in the dark and who will devour or infect anyone or anything in their path. For three years, Neville has spent his days scavenging for food and supplies and faithfully sending out radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. All the while, the Infected lurk in the shadows, watching Neville's every move, waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But his blood is also what The Infected hunt, and Neville knows he is outnumbered and quickly running out of time. The cast led by Will Smith (as Robert Neville) is excellent!

657267,A329ALHKYK62O7,B00005JPTK,Ky. Col.,"[1, 2]","I AM LEGEND is a masterful horror story.  The story opens with the television interview of a medical researcher (Emma Thompson) discussing how the measels virus has been genetically engineered to cure cancer.  Suddenly the film flashes to the haunting images of an abandoned and overgrown New York three years later.  Military officer and virus specialist Robert Nevile (Will Smith) prowls the streets with his dog by day scavenging and sending out messages for any survivors of the pandemic which swept the globe.  By evening, Nevil withdrawls to his fortified house/labratory carefully disguising his presence.  The cancer cure of course went horribly wrong with well over 5 billion people killed by the virus.  Hundreds of million more were mutated into ferocious nocturnal beings constantly in search of prey.The film is action packed, melacholy, haunting, and at times very intense.  I would not recommend it for younger children due to the frightening scenes.  Smith shows off his considerable acting talent as his character exhibits a full range of human emotion.  The scenes of an abandoned New York with its blown bridges is haunting; especially memorable is a scene of Nevile golfing off an abandoned aircraft carrier.  Here the seemingly lone surviror stands dwarfed amidst the ruins of civilization.  It gets one thinking how fragile society can be.  Surprisingly some scenes are even emotionally powerful--especially the flashbacks of Nevile's  family being killed in the final flight from Manhattan before complete quaranteen went into effect.  The cinematography is also competent.An interesting aspect late in the film differs considerably from Matheson's book (actually the film itself is far different from the novel).  The irony of the novel is that the character essentially demythologizes his vampire antagonists before ultimately becoming the basis of a legend for a new post-human society.  In this film version Nevile apparently rediscovers God's purpose for his life at the very end as he realizes what he can do for the surviving human society.  Although I wont go further into detail about the ending it is hopefully but not entirely happy.  I have read Matheson's novel, watched the Vincent Price ""Last Man on Earth"" and seen most of the Charleton Heston film ""The Omega Man.""  This update is my favorite interpretation of the story including the novel.  Although Heston was one of my favorite actors and I generally enjoy Vincent Price, I must say that Smith's performance as Nevile surpasses both in my opinion.Overall a fine horror/action film which really transcends its genre into some effective drama.

Perhaps my hopes were just too high but let's look at this point by point.I Am Legend is roughly take 6 at the original novel of the same name.  The Omega Man is probably the most popular and, for fans of that movie and older generations, this will prove very disappointing as both films derive multiple themes from the book such as Sam the dog, a woman entering Neville's life, etc, etc.  ""IAL"" just was not unique enough to satisfy certain fans.  For the general audience, however, there are some redeeming qualities.The visual were very nice.  New York city was reproduced superbly if not used outright as several blocks were closed off for the filming; kudos.  The ""monsters"" were kind of freaky but I almost felt a humanistic touch to them as one seemed to express remorse for losing one of his kind (I thought she was his daughter or something) but it's not expanded on.The acting, which comprises almost solely on Will Smith, is superb.  I still am having trouble finding a movie Will Smith acted poorly in every movie he is in I think about seeing just on that basis.  He performs well as a man living almost entirely alone for several years but remains diligent in his tasks.The story had potential.  It deviated slightly from the book in terms of the ending but I think almost for the better.  I'm glad the directors took a different approach to the Twilight Zone-esque themes of vampires that the original book took.  DESPITE ALL THIS, the movie was TOO SHORT.  It was barely 90 minutes (I think) and sooo much more could've been explained, expanded upon or even made somewhat kewl.  The ending came too quick and very anti-climatic almost to the bewilderment of the audience.  They didn't even bother to explain how certain things came to be and that really bothered me.The story is similar to War of the Worlds only the movie didn't suck as much; too many holes, not enough time.  IAL could've easily been an epic but directors settled for a 90-minute money bagger and I'm quite disappointed.  The movie started out awesome but just fell short at the end.I will still buy this on DVD when it comes out but for theater goers I must give a warning that there are holes.  Also, THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM.  Several people tried to ward me off due to ""horror-elements.""  This is not the case.  If anything, it is a thriller.  It is appropriate for most audiences although I wouldn't bring too young of kids.All in all, a B-.  Diss marks for lack of story and length.

657273,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JPTK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 6]","My standard for judging ""I Am Legend"" is not theoriginal novelby Richard Matheson but ""The Omega Man.""  I watched the 1971 adaptation starring Charlton Heston last month in anticipation of going to see this new version, a master plan thwarted by classes not ending until December 21st this year.  I also tried to avoid hearing what other thought about this movie, but I did hear whispers about how the premise was great but that audiences were disappointed by the ending.  This might be an inevitable complaint about this story because after establishing the whole idea of being the last man on earth (a point hammered home in the omnipresent trailers for the film), the movie has to deal with the fact the hero is not the last man on Earth, albeit the last one living on the island of Manhattan.  If you think about what Will Smith's Robert Neville life has been like for the last three years, then what happens in this film represents a series of significant changes cascading through the end credits.I think ""I Am Legend"" is way better than ""Omega Man,"" which is why its rating ends up being two stars better.  Director Francis Lawrence (""Constantine"") has the advantage of the stunning transformation of New York City into a true urban jungle, while the screenplay by Mark Protosevich (""The Cell"") and Akiva Goldsman (""I, Robot"") constructs a mixture of set pieces (e.g., Neville deer hunting), simple moments (e.g., Neville picking up a video), and flashbacks to the last time Neville say his wife and daughter.  The irony that a cure for cancer could turn into a plague that decimates the Earth is palatable (never trust a virus), and this time around Neville is a virologist, so he is still searching for a cure three years later.  The best parts of Smith's performance are done in silence; this might be a science fiction film but his work here is solid.  I also like the way things play out in the end, both in terms of the harsh reality of Neville's tenuous situation and also with regards to the psychology of the character that motivates his words and deeds during the end game.There is no attempt to explain every thing that Neville is doing, which makes sense given that unless he is dictating a report in his lab the only other living thing he could talk to is his German shepherd Sam, and the need to explain everything to Sam passed long ago.  The plethora of zombie films in recent years, especially those that have decided zombies no longer lumber around but constantly sprint (to wit, ""Day of the Dead"" and ""28 Weeks Later""/""28 Days Later"") might be misleading viewers into thinking the monsters in this one are zombie-like, but the specific evidence supplied in the film clearly indicates they are vampire-like.  One of the neat things I know about Matheson's novel was that he came up with scientific explanations for the key tenants of vampire lore, and I do wish those parts of the movie had been more explicit, but at least the film is consistent in leaving it to the audience to figure things out.I have yet to see ""The Last Man on Earth,"" so it would be premature to say that ""I Am Legend"" is the best version of Matheson's novel, but the bottom line is that I was quite satisfied with this movie.  This is not to say that the film is perfect: when other humans show up it seems impossible, given the isolation of Manhattan and who the humans are, that they are able to get there and and do what they do.  But I round up on ""I Am Legend"" because it rings true that Smith's Neville would have slipped over the line into madness given the personal isolation and demons that have tormented him for three years.  His descent is tragic, which makes the resolution of this film so much more preferable to what happens with Heston's character in the other version.  Besides, I like Neville's taste in works of art to appropriate from MOMA.",5,"This might be a minority opinion but I was not disappointed by this version of ""I Am Legend'",1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,3859,"['standard', 'judging', 'Am', 'Legend', 'not', 'theoriginal', 'novelby', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Omega', 'Man', 'watched', '1971', 'adaptation', 'starring', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'last', 'month', 'anticipation', 'going', 'see', 'new', 'version', 'master', 'plan', 'thwarted', 'classes', 'not', 'ending', 'December', '21st', 'year', 'also', 'tried', 'avoid', 'hearing', 'what', 'other', 'thought', 'movie', 'did', 'hear', 'whispers', 'how', 'premise', 'was', 'great', 'audiences', 'were', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'might', 'be', 'inevitable', 'complaint', 'story', 'establishing', 'whole', 'idea', 'being', 'last', 'man', 'earth', 'point', 'hammered', 'home', 'omnipresent', 'trailers', 'film', 'movie', 'deal', 'fact', 'hero', 'not', 'last', 'man', 'Earth', 'last', 'one', 'living', 'island', 'Manhattan', 'think', 'what', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'life', 'been', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'then', 'what', 'film', 'series', 'significant', 'changes', 'cascading', 'end', 'credits.I', 'think', 'Am', 'Legend', 'way', 'better', 'Omega', 'Man', 'why', 'rating', 'up', 'being', 'two', 'stars', 'better', 'Director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'Constantine', 'advantage', 'stunning', 'transformation', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'true', 'urban', 'jungle', 'screenplay', 'Mark', 'Protosevich', 'Cell', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'Robot', 'mixture', 'set', 'pieces', 'e.g.', 'Neville', 'deer', 'hunting', 'simple', 'moments', 'e.g.', 'Neville', 'picking', 'up', 'video', 'flashbacks', 'last', 'time', 'Neville', 'say', 'wife', 'daughter', 'irony', 'cure', 'cancer', 'could', 'turn', 'plague', 'Earth', 'palatable', 'never', 'trust', 'virus', 'time', 'Neville', 'virologist', 'still', 'searching', 'cure', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'best', 'parts', 'Smith', 'performance', 'are', 'done', 'silence', 'might', 'be', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'work', 'here', 'solid', 'also', 'way', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'end', 'terms', 'harsh', 'reality', 'Neville', 'tenuous', 'situation', 'also', 'regards', 'psychology', 'character', 'words', 'deeds', 'end', 'game.There', 'attempt', 'explain', 'thing', 'Neville', 'doing', 'sense', 'given', 'dictating', 'report', 'lab', 'only', 'other', 'living', 'thing', 'could', 'talk', 'German', 'shepherd', 'Sam', 'need', 'explain', 'everything', 'Sam', 'passed', 'long', 'ago', 'plethora', 'zombie', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'especially', 'have', 'decided', 'zombies', 'no', 'longer', 'lumber', 'constantly', 'sprint', 'wit', 'Day', 'Dead', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', '/', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'might', 'be', 'misleading', 'viewers', 'thinking', 'monsters', 'one', 'are', 'zombie-like', 'specific', 'evidence', 'supplied', 'film', 'clearly', 'are', 'vampire-like', 'One', 'neat', 'things', 'know', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'was', 'came', 'up', 'scientific', 'explanations', 'key', 'tenants', 'vampire', 'lore', 'do', 'wish', 'parts', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'explicit', 'least', 'film', 'consistent', 'leaving', 'audience', 'figure', 'things', 'out.I', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'would', 'be', 'premature', 'say', 'Am', 'Legend', 'best', 'version', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'bottom', 'line', 'was', 'quite', 'satisfied', 'movie', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'perfect', 'when', 'other', 'humans', 'show', 'up', 'impossible', 'given', 'isolation', 'Manhattan', 'who', 'humans', 'are', 'are', 'able', 'get', 'there', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'round', 'up', 'Am', 'Legend', 'true', 'Smith', 'Neville', 'would', 'have', 'slipped', 'line', 'madness', 'given', 'personal', 'isolation', 'demons', 'have', 'tormented', 'three', 'years', 'descent', 'tragic', 'resolution', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'preferable', 'what', 'Heston', 'character', 'other', 'version', 'like', 'Neville', 'taste', 'works', 'art', 'appropriate', 'MOMA']",I Am Legend
657274,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JPTK,Lawyeraau,"[4, 4]","I love Will Smith and have always enjoyed his films. So, when I heard he was doing this remake of the book, ""I Am Legend"", Richard Matheson's masterpiece of horror, I could not wait to see the film. Having already seen the two prior adaptations, ""The Omega Man"", starring Charlton Heston,  and ""The Last Man on Earth"", starring Vincent Price, I looked forward to seeing what this remake would bring to the table.This is an interesting adaptation of the book in many ways, capturing the essence of despair, loneliness, and hope that runs through the book and transferring it successfully to film.  Here, Will Smith is cast as Robert Neville, a military scientist who finds that he is immune to the virus that has run amok and globally killed off most of the population or turned them into vampire-like killers who dwell in the dark, coming out only at night where they prowl the earth seeking other living creatures to nosh on.Robert Neville seems to be the only human being left in New York City. Coming out by day with his beloved dog, Sam, which is his only companion, Neville hunts for food and necessities, taking care to get home before night fall. He lives in solitary splendor in his town house in Washington Square Park, where he struggles to find a cure for the virus in hopes of restoring humanity to those rabid creatures that were once human and now prowl the earth at night.The bleak landscape of a New York City that is  ravaged by the changes is compelling, and Smith, as Neville, does exude that pathos of a man who has nearly lost all hope. His attempts at communicating with other human beings that have not been transformed by the virus are touching, especially so when we see how he longs for interaction with others like himself.Unfortunately, the film becomes undone by too much reliance on computer generated monsters, failing to realize that less is sometimes more.  Instead, the special effects render the second half of the film to something that one would see in a video game. Consequently, I found myself hoping that the end of the film would soon arrive.While I did enjoy the film overall, it was, ultimately, disappointing, as my expectations were so high. It is unfortunate that the powers that be were so enamored of the special effects that they were unable to show some restraint. What was potentially a filmmaking masterpiece turned into a film that was simply a contender, despite Will Smith's excellent performance. In the end, it was a performance that was overshadowed by the filmmaker's excess.",3,DISAPPOINTING...,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,2534,"['love', 'Will', 'Smith', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'So', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'doing', 'remake', 'book', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'masterpiece', 'horror', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'film', 'Having', 'already', 'seen', 'two', 'prior', 'adaptations', 'Omega', 'Man', 'starring', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'starring', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'remake', 'would', 'bring', 'table.This', 'interesting', 'adaptation', 'book', 'many', 'ways', 'capturing', 'essence', 'despair', 'loneliness', 'hope', 'book', 'transferring', 'successfully', 'film', 'Here', 'Will', 'Smith', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'military', 'scientist', 'who', 'immune', 'virus', 'run', 'amok', 'globally', 'killed', 'off', 'most', 'population', 'turned', 'vampire-like', 'killers', 'who', 'dwell', 'dark', 'coming', 'out', 'only', 'night', 'where', 'prowl', 'earth', 'seeking', 'other', 'living', 'creatures', 'nosh', 'on.Robert', 'Neville', 'be', 'only', 'human', 'being', 'left', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Coming', 'out', 'day', 'beloved', 'dog', 'Sam', 'only', 'companion', 'Neville', 'hunts', 'food', 'necessities', 'taking', 'care', 'get', 'home', 'night', 'fall', 'solitary', 'splendor', 'town', 'house', 'Washington', 'Square', 'Park', 'where', 'find', 'cure', 'virus', 'hopes', 'restoring', 'humanity', 'rabid', 'creatures', 'were', 'once', 'human', 'now', 'earth', 'night.The', 'bleak', 'landscape', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'ravaged', 'changes', 'compelling', 'Smith', 'Neville', 'exude', 'pathos', 'man', 'who', 'nearly', 'lost', 'hope', 'attempts', 'communicating', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'transformed', 'virus', 'are', 'touching', 'especially', 'so', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'interaction', 'others', 'himself.Unfortunately', 'film', 'undone', 'too', 'much', 'reliance', 'computer', 'generated', 'monsters', 'failing', 'realize', 'less', 'sometimes', 'more', 'Instead', 'special', 'effects', 'render', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'something', 'one', 'would', 'see', 'video', 'game', 'Consequently', 'found', 'hoping', 'end', 'film', 'would', 'soon', 'arrive.While', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'overall', 'was', 'ultimately', 'disappointing', 'expectations', 'were', 'so', 'high', 'unfortunate', 'powers', 'be', 'were', 'so', 'enamored', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'unable', 'show', 'restraint', 'What', 'was', 'potentially', 'filmmaking', 'masterpiece', 'turned', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'contender', 'Will', 'Smith', 'excellent', 'performance', 'end', 'was', 'performance', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'filmmaker', 'excess']",I Am Legend

The book and film are about Dr. Neville (who also works for the government) believing himself to be the lone survivor after a worldwide catastrophe. Like many end-of-the-world themes Neville finds others while fighting off the dead who have risen again. The book is still regarded as one of the Top 3 vampire/zombie stories of all time. This film depicts the zombies as fairly brainless but they are chillingly effective. Will Smith does a good job of portraying the flawed hero who struggles to keep his spirits up. I have known people who shrink away at some of the zombie scenes in this movie. The special effects work well and don't dominate the story. If you like end of the world themes and zombies (e.g. 28 Days Later) then this will be a great flick.The view of a deserted New York looks great, Will Smith can carry the whole movie easily on his shoulders (there are few survivors after all), and this is likely the best version available of the original novel. The other film versions are great in their own way but have dated costumes and effects. If you like this film then see The Omega Man and The Last Man on Earth which are the earlier adaptations of I Am Legend. The only downsides are that zombies age quickly (seen Night of the Living Dead lately?) and this film is no exception. Also, the dark ending turns some people off (love it).The picture and audio quality are superb.

657291,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B00005JPTK,Marc Cabir Davis,"[11, 21]","There are a few sublime moments in ""I Am Legend"" that make you realize just how amazing a science fiction film can be. The genre has long been my favorite, and even though this isn't a sci-fi film in the strictest sense of the term, it has shades of the genre all through it.Prime moments include Will Smith entering a dark building in search of his dog, and then battling with monsters he never knew existed (literally). There is one particularly effective scene, where Will Smith knows that his dog has been 'infected', watches his dog turn into a monster before his eyes, and then kills it with his bare hands. The entire sequence plays out like a subdued exercise in human tolerance and reaction - and it was carried out superbly by Will Smith.In fact, it is Smiths' amazing screen presence and top-notch acting ability that makes this film as good as it is. However, he is let down by a very weak script, a nonsensical ending, and is paired opposite a tepid actress in the second half who reduces the film to a parody of itself. My primary problem with the second half is that it entirely undid all the solemn promise the first half did. The climax is a huge group of monsters (very poor CGI here) trying to attack Smith, who in turn destroys himself and the facility so that the monsters perish as well. This 'Save the World' sentiment has been overdone in way too many Hollywood films, and it just didnt work here.The best parts of 'I Am Legend' are when it slows down to a quiet, sombre pace. The first hour, with its languid passages of just Will Smith walking and bonding with his dog are the most poignant, and the most real. This is a one-man movie, and its a pity that when it moves away from that, it doesn't work. By no means a classic, or even a 'very good film', but this is one movie well worth watching - it could have been much, much worse.Three Stars.",3,Almost A Sci-Fi Classic : Just Off the Mark,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,1872,"['are', 'few', 'sublime', 'moments', 'Am', 'Legend', 'make', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'amazing', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'genre', 'long', 'been', 'favorite', 'even', ""n't"", 'sci-fi', 'film', 'strictest', 'sense', 'term', 'shades', 'genre', 'it.Prime', 'moments', 'include', 'Will', 'Smith', 'entering', 'dark', 'building', 'search', 'dog', 'then', 'battling', 'monsters', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'literally', 'one', 'particularly', 'effective', 'scene', 'where', 'Will', 'Smith', 'dog', 'been', ""'infected"", 'dog', 'turn', 'monster', 'eyes', 'then', 'bare', 'hands', 'entire', 'sequence', 'out', 'subdued', 'exercise', 'human', 'tolerance', 'reaction', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'superbly', 'Will', 'Smith.In', 'fact', 'Smiths', 'amazing', 'screen', 'presence', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'ability', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'However', 'let', 'down', 'very', 'weak', 'script', 'nonsensical', 'ending', 'paired', 'tepid', 'actress', 'second', 'half', 'who', 'film', 'parody', 'primary', 'problem', 'second', 'half', 'entirely', 'solemn', 'promise', 'first', 'half', 'did', 'climax', 'huge', 'group', 'monsters', 'very', 'poor', 'CGI', 'here', 'trying', 'attack', 'Smith', 'who', 'turn', 'facility', 'so', 'monsters', 'perish', 'as', 'well', 'World', 'sentiment', 'been', 'overdone', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'just', 'didnt', 'work', 'here.The', 'best', 'parts', 'Am', 'Legend', 'are', 'when', 'down', 'quiet', 'sombre', 'pace', 'first', 'hour', 'languid', 'passages', 'just', 'Will', 'Smith', 'walking', 'bonding', 'dog', 'are', 'most', 'poignant', 'most', 'real', 'one-man', 'movie', 'pity', 'when', 'away', ""n't"", 'work', 'means', 'classic', 'even', ""'very"", 'good', 'film', 'one', 'movie', 'well', 'watching', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'worse.Three', 'Stars']",I Am Legend

He wasn't a legend because he found 'the cure' as this movie states at the end.  In the two previous films, the Neville character spent the daytime hours hunting and killing the vampires totally unaware that there was a small population of infected humans who weren't eating people yet.  In this latest remake they even show a scene of Neville marking off on a map the buildings that he had checked but this is NEVER explained in the film.  They completely removed the vampire hunting aspect from the story which makes the 'marking-off-buildings-checked' scene totally nonsensical.This movie is yet another example of Hollywood signing a big star and casting him in an expensive CGI spectacular where he can run around doing amazing things before ultimately saving the day.  Well, they should have tried to save this story first.  It stinks.",1,Why Was Neville A Legend?

So begins ""I Am Legend.""The ""I Am Legend"" film is different from all previous versions of this story.  Many of the new plot and story elements will appeal more to today's audience.  Some of the esoteric and philosophical messages of the original story are lost, but this film stands on it's own.First of all, the burning questions: Is this film worth seeing in the theatre, or should I wait for the DVD to release?Answer:  GO SEE THIS IN THE THEATRE!!!  Also, films like this will make their HD DVD counterparts more attractive as well.  But I digress.The visual elements of this movie are worth the price of admission alone.  Everything is done well together - special effects, lighting, sound, aspect.  The in-movie songs used could have been more diverse, but the score more than makes up for it.  Bottom line, I would pay to see this in the theatre again, and I can't wait to see what it looks like in HD with 7.1 surround sound at home.Now, how about the acting?  Will Smith is really great in this movie.  Women will no doubt drool at the work-out scene that was put in every trailer.  He gives a very real portrayal that's more than just eye candy.Now, some of the story elements go backwards in the second half of the movie.  But I think that was done intentionally, agree or disagree.  They really wanted to show him fighting to keep it together, and breaking down at times, and the plot suffers as a result.As for the plot, there's no need to re-hash that or give spoiler details.  We all know the basics from the trailer.  See the movie and be surprised.One thing I am very interested in the future DVD is potential alternate endings.  Since this story deviated from the original, I wonder if there was any waffling on that.  We'll all have to wait and see.Overall, this is a very good movie for SCI-FI fans and special effects lovers.

Nevertheless, the film did have some good moments and even had moments of intense drama.

657303,AXLXU4LMIRO3F,B00005JPTK,MartialWay,"[1, 3]","I read the book. Twice. Well, not really. I read it and I listened to the unabridged audiobook. I took one look at Will Smith walking the streets of a desolated New York, playing what in the book was a blonde white dude in an equally ruined Los Angeles, and I knew that they weren't sticking to the book like glue, which is fine.Let's be real. Will Smith is cool and New York makes for a far better wasteland than L.A.; so who cares? I don't. Monsters from L.A. would be too busy looking in the mirror, but New York monsters... New Yorkers are already creatures of the night and also rude as hell on their best days, so they'd make awesome gangrel man-eaters. Besides, I have come to accept that movies are generally never like the book, the book is always better... you know the speech.As long as the story remains the same, the theme and the message from the book is still there, I have no gripe when filmmakers break from the book here and there. The problem is they did not bother at all. They took the title, and made some other version of ""28 Days Later""Moving right along, I'll make believe there isn't a book. I'm not going sit here and regurgitate what you read in other reviews before mine in regards to the book vs. the movie. That they didn't recreate the book 100% is not a good reason to shun this film. It's worth watching... once.First, Will Smith is fan-tastic.The setting and tone of the movie makes for a mild horror film that's hard not to be drawn into. Me? I love post-apocalyptic stuff. As much as I would hate to be there, I often wonder how people would cope after being stripped of everything that makes life simple for most of us. Having this guy, Robert Neville, the last human on Earth, having to compete with a new species is still interesting material. Vampires? Who needs em? We know their routine back and forth anyway. You won't miss them... unless you're a goth.Watching Will hunting, gathering, seeing deer and stuff graze grass from the broken pavement, being preyed upon by lions and... what were they... infected zombies, or whatever, and conversing with mannequins out of loneliness; that's just great stuff to see, and it gives the movie an emotional edge that's missing in most scary movies. I loved all of that.They kind of failed to deliver the other half of what makes scary movies great. Don't get me wrong. There were some real tense moments; you find that these monsters aren't stupid when they lay a trap that Will stumbles into. Good stuff; some tenseness, you'll be waiting for things to jump out, and they do, but there is little violence, which yes, irked me.I was like, ""Come on, I get that you can't mess up the last man alive too much, but since you're doing flashbacks anyway, how about some memories of zombie rampage; people being ripped up and devoured like little turkeys, gobbling in helpless terror? Give us an idea of what Will has to look forward to if he messes up just a little."" Nope.I mean, they make a movie with zombies, or whatever they were, and though it's a clear threat, they don't give us much of what makes these kinds of movies really thrilling-- blood and limb ripping.You know what really disappoints me though? When Will is out there, in one scene, if you look up there is a movie billboard displaying the Batman symbol with Superman's crest inside of it suggesting that a Batman/Superman film was forthcoming. Stupid Emma Thomson had to make her ""cure"" for cancer and now both Christian Bale and Brandon Routh are frikin zombies (probably looking at themselves in the mirror somewhere in ""infected"" L.A.) and they never got to release what would have been a much more exciting movie than ""I Am frickin Legend""!But anyway...As much as I think one might enjoy watching this movie once, to me, it doesn't have the kind of re-playability that would justify buying this on DVD let alone Blu-Ray. For sure, see it. The movie had its moments. I enjoyed it, but it left a lot to be desired.Forgetting that the guys who made this flick did not read the book at all and completely missed the target that the book hit hard. This movie is just okay, ""weaksauce"" as a friend of mine would put it.Thanks for taking the time to read my worthless opinion, and I hope it helped.",3,"Good flick.

657304,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00005JPTK,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[2, 3]","Of the three films based on the novel by Richard Matheson, the newest I AM LEGEND ranks as the middle.  In the first, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH,  Vincent Price used his unique ability to make the audience feel his pain as he often writhed in agony in a sea of goo. In the second, THE OMEGA MAN, Charlton Heston played the straight man to a horde of glowing eyed hippies all of whom favored the flowing robes associated with cinematic free love communes. Will Smith completes the trifecta with I AM LEGEND that has less to do with Matheson's novel and more to do with a series of philosophical conundrums that simmer beneath the assigned text.The plot is well know to anyone who has seen any of its twin predecessors. New York City (and presumably much of the world) has been hit with a plague that started out as a cure devised by Emma Thompson in a surprisingly minor role. The cure mutates such that its victims morph into a race of computer-generated pseudo-humans that we have seen before, most recently as the Morlocks in the revised THE TIME MACHINE. Smith as Dr. Robert Neville and his dog have to survive as he seeks a cure.  The most interesting part of the film is the first half.  The stunning scenes of a deserted and decrepit Manhattan form a subtext that reminds one of the recent book THE WORLD WITHOUT US. What would happen to man's mightiest works of art, of architecture, and of general accomplishment if man himself should vanish? The result would be a creepy sense that humanity is like a temporary boil on the butt of this planet that would soon enough shake off all evidence that we once walked the cobbled streets as the Lords of Creation. The pace of the first half is slow and rightfully slow.  Smith walks the streets of New York and sees a muted civilization crumbling even as a jungle reaches out to reclaim its own.  Smith plays Neville as a man hurt by his inability to find a cure. He dares to allow the audience to feel his isolation as he walks in and out of a video store seeking companionship from a few mannikins. The pace of the second half soon switches from static to kinetic.  Action abounds with mutated dogs and wall-crawling freaky zombies making the movie more of a mind-numbing but less interesting actioner that seeks to find a cure for the plague. The only problem was that the computer-enhanced scenes of morphed humans become the focal point of audience interest, and after a while, that audience soon realizes that except for the one mutate who seems to be the leader, that one mutate is pretty much like any other.  For a comparison about how to keep a crumbling civilization film on track, one need only look at how Vincent Price used the force of his personality and at a fraction of the cost. Here Smith tries mightily to be the dramatic center, but his attempt was doomed by over-eager technical wizards who have proved for the umpteenth time that new-fangled wizardry will never trump the ability of an actor to dominate a scene or an entire film with his voice and twisting body.  I suspect that there will be plenty of viewers who will gladly pay to see I AM LEGEND one time, but once having done so, will refrain from watching this latest version and will happily tune in late at night to watch how Vincent Price gets the job done.",3,Will Smith is no Vincent Price,1202601600,"02 10, 2008",2008,3286,"['three', 'films', 'based', 'novel', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'newest', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'ranks', 'middle', 'first', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'ON', 'EARTH', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'used', 'unique', 'ability', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'pain', 'often', 'writhed', 'agony', 'sea', 'goo', 'second', 'THE', 'OMEGA', 'MAN', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'played', 'straight', 'man', 'horde', 'glowing', 'eyed', 'hippies', 'whom', 'favored', 'flowing', 'robes', 'associated', 'cinematic', 'free', 'love', 'communes', 'Will', 'Smith', 'trifecta', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'less', 'do', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'more', 'do', 'series', 'philosophical', 'conundrums', 'simmer', 'assigned', 'text.The', 'plot', 'well', 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'twin', 'predecessors', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'presumably', 'much', 'world', 'been', 'hit', 'plague', 'started', 'out', 'cure', 'devised', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'surprisingly', 'minor', 'role', 'cure', 'such', 'victims', 'morph', 'race', 'computer-generated', 'pseudo-humans', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'most', 'recently', 'Morlocks', 'revised', 'THE', 'TIME', 'MACHINE', 'Smith', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'dog', 'have', 'survive', 'cure', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'stunning', 'scenes', 'deserted', 'decrepit', 'Manhattan', 'form', 'subtext', 'one', 'recent', 'book', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'WITHOUT', 'US', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'man', 'mightiest', 'works', 'art', 'architecture', 'general', 'accomplishment', 'man', 'should', 'vanish', 'result', 'would', 'be', 'creepy', 'sense', 'humanity', 'temporary', 'boil', 'butt', 'planet', 'would', 'soon', 'enough', 'shake', 'off', 'evidence', 'once', 'walked', 'cobbled', 'streets', 'Lords', 'Creation', 'pace', 'first', 'half', 'slow', 'rightfully', 'slow', 'Smith', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'muted', 'civilization', 'crumbling', 'even', 'jungle', 'out', 'reclaim', 'own', 'Smith', 'Neville', 'man', 'hurt', 'inability', 'find', 'cure', 'allow', 'audience', 'feel', 'isolation', 'video', 'store', 'seeking', 'companionship', 'few', 'mannikins', 'pace', 'second', 'half', 'soon', 'switches', 'static', 'kinetic', 'Action', 'mutated', 'dogs', 'wall-crawling', 'freaky', 'zombies', 'making', 'movie', 'more', 'mind-numbing', 'less', 'interesting', 'actioner', 'find', 'cure', 'plague', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'computer-enhanced', 'scenes', 'morphed', 'humans', 'become', 'focal', 'point', 'audience', 'interest', 'while', 'audience', 'soon', 'one', 'mutate', 'who', 'be', 'leader', 'one', 'mutate', 'pretty', 'much', 'other', 'comparison', 'how', 'keep', 'crumbling', 'civilization', 'film', 'track', 'one', 'need', 'only', 'look', 'how', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'used', 'force', 'personality', 'fraction', 'cost', 'Here', 'Smith', 'tries', 'mightily', 'be', 'dramatic', 'center', 'attempt', 'was', 'doomed', 'over-eager', 'technical', 'wizards', 'who', 'have', 'proved', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'new-fangled', 'wizardry', 'will', 'never', 'trump', 'ability', 'actor', 'dominate', 'scene', 'entire', 'film', 'voice', 'twisting', 'body', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'plenty', 'viewers', 'who', 'will', 'gladly', 'pay', 'see', 'AM', 'LEGEND', 'one', 'time', 'once', 'having', 'done', 'so', 'will', 'refrain', 'watching', 'latest', 'version', 'will', 'happily', 'tune', 'late', 'night', 'watch', 'how', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'job', 'done']",I Am Legend

My choice would be ""He was Legend"" based on the ending of the theatrical version. In the book the title highlights the irony of Neville's existence and demise, here it makes little sense.On individual merit, this version is worthwhile, bordering on above average in the genre of horror/zombie films, although in the original works the creatures pursuing - or alternatively pursued by - Robert Neville were vampires, and the movie's arguably cathartic, placebo of a conclusion is uninspired.  My difficulty is compartmentalizing the film and the book because knowledge of the source material rendered the film somewhat disappointing. While a few of the liberties or adaptations infused by the screenwriters are largely cosmetic, some can be attributed to the eras of the media as the novella was published in 1954. I did not find the change in locale from Los Angeles to NYC to be detracting even though it seemed to be a vehicle to substantiate an ""Escape from New York"" themed back story that is non-existent in the book. Altering the significance of the dog was a tender touch however I thought the role of the dog in the book conveyed Neville's conflicting senses of isolation and optimism much more effectively.  The introduction of the woman and the child to the movie, while in all likelihood unavoidable to tie this story together, unfortunately, resulted in a near complete loss of focus and direction.The adjustment in his occupation and experience may have been necessary within the constraints of film however Matheson's depiction of Neville as an average man forced by the vagaries of chance to carve out his daily existence was engrossing. Here, Will Smith's character is a physically fit, militarily trained scientist doing only what he knows best, continuing the research he started before the infection overran humankind.

Vulnerabilities to religious icons were merely psychological holdovers from victims of a disease who believed they were vampires.  But the thirst for blood was very real. It established the post-apocalyptic fear of contamination.Since I Am Legend is a Will Smith vehicle, I figured it'd have some wisecracks, a lot of action, and Smith saving the day.  So I was surprised to get exactly that - but not delivered in the way I expected.I Am Legend is very much like aA Boy & His Dogin that our two protagonists are Robert Neville (Will Smith), a virologist responsible for finding a cure in New York City, and his dog Samantha, wandering a world gone mad. What's interesting about I Am Legend is the question posed by the title.  Why is Neville a legend?The most obvious answer is that Neville is immune to the disease that has converted 90 percent of humanity.  As such, he believes he holds the cure within himself.  In that regard, if Neville can succeed in stopping the plague, he will be a legend to all of humankind.  But there's more to I Am Legend than that.It's fitting that his companion is a dog.  With only Sam as his companion, Neville is truly a legend; the only other living being idolizes Neville, just as dogs idolize their masters.  Neville also creates a fictional community of people out of mannequins in a DVD rental store, where everybody knows his name.  Neville is indeed a legend in his own mind.There's also the possibility, posited in the original story, that Neville isn't famous as a savior, but infamous amongst the new breed of humanity as a mass murderer.  In that regard Neville is legendary not because of whom he saves but whom he kills.  Neville sacrifices countless of the infected in a quest for a cure, and in the process loses a little bit of his own humanity.I Am Legend could easily have been an egotistical macho romp in a world gone mad in the vein ofMad Max.  Instead, it is a thoughtful meditation on how communities define ourselves, even if your only friend is a dog.  Although the director flinches at the uncompromising ending that could have been (and is on the two-disc special edition), I Am Legend is a serious entry in both science fiction movies and Will Smith's string of blockbusters.",5,What Does it Take to Become a Legend?,1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,2315,"['Am', 'Legend', 'novel', 'spawned', 'vampires-as-physical-phenomena', 'genre', 'Vulnerabilities', 'religious', 'icons', 'were', 'merely', 'psychological', 'holdovers', 'victims', 'disease', 'who', 'believed', 'were', 'vampires', 'thirst', 'blood', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'established', 'post-apocalyptic', 'fear', 'contamination.Since', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Will', 'Smith', 'vehicle', 'figured', ""'d"", 'have', 'wisecracks', 'lot', 'action', 'Smith', 'saving', 'day', 'was', 'surprised', 'get', 'exactly', 'not', 'delivered', 'way', 'expected.I', 'Am', 'Legend', 'very', 'much', 'aA', 'Boy', 'Dogin', 'two', 'protagonists', 'are', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'Will', 'Smith', 'virologist', 'responsible', 'finding', 'cure', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'dog', 'Samantha', 'wandering', 'world', 'gone', 'mad', 'What', 'interesting', 'Am', 'Legend', 'question', 'posed', 'title', 'Why', 'Neville', 'legend', 'most', 'obvious', 'answer', 'Neville', 'immune', 'disease', 'converted', '90', 'percent', 'humanity', 'such', 'cure', 'regard', 'Neville', 'can', 'succeed', 'stopping', 'plague', 'will', 'be', 'legend', 'humankind', 'more', 'Am', 'Legend', 'that.It', 'fitting', 'companion', 'dog', 'only', 'Sam', 'companion', 'Neville', 'truly', 'legend', 'only', 'other', 'living', 'being', 'idolizes', 'Neville', 'just', 'dogs', 'idolize', 'masters', 'Neville', 'also', 'fictional', 'community', 'people', 'mannequins', 'DVD', 'rental', 'store', 'where', 'everybody', 'name', 'Neville', 'indeed', 'legend', 'own', 'mind.There', 'also', 'possibility', 'posited', 'original', 'story', 'Neville', ""n't"", 'famous', 'savior', 'infamous', 'new', 'breed', 'humanity', 'mass', 'murderer', 'regard', 'Neville', 'legendary', 'not', 'whom', 'whom', 'Neville', 'countless', 'infected', 'quest', 'cure', 'process', 'little', 'bit', 'own', 'humanity.I', 'Am', 'Legend', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'egotistical', 'macho', 'romp', 'world', 'gone', 'mad', 'vein', 'Max', 'Instead', 'thoughtful', 'meditation', 'how', 'communities', 'define', 'even', 'only', 'friend', 'dog', 'director', 'flinches', 'uncompromising', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'two-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'Am', 'Legend', 'serious', 'entry', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'Will', 'Smith', 'string', 'blockbusters']",I Am Legend

This one, of course, is a remake of _The Omega Man_ (the only good film Charlton Heston ever made, in my opinion), which was based on the novel by Richard Matheson -- also one of my favorites. (The version meant to star Schwarzenegger fell through before completion.) And there was a terrible version starring Vincent Price called _The Last Man on Earth._ Also, Will Smith, who is actually a pretty good actor, had already appeared in _I, Robot,_ one of the worst films ever based on a classic science fiction story. So, would this attempt be any better?I'm pleased to say that, while this version of one of the best ""zombie"" yarns ever written has significant differences from both the book and the Heston movie, it's a very good piece of work taken on its own. Smith is Robert Neville, an army researcher involved in developing the genetically mutated virus that brings an end to cancer as it spreads. Unfortunately, it mutates farther than intended and kills off ninety percent of the world's population. Of the survivors, another few percent become inhuman ""Dark Seekers"" and kill off all the others. Neville is one of only a handful of naturally immune individuals. And while cooped up in his house on Washington Square, trying desperately to find a cure for the plague he helped cause, he's going slowly and quietly insane. And when night comes, the windows are shuttered and the doors bolted because the Infected will be coming out to hunt. Smith plays the role with considerable power and believability.

Meaning it's the end of the world, and either there is one survivor or a few, but the results are the same...people really discovering how to survive during the end of days. Ex-Military researcher, Nevell is apparently immune to the very real vampire-like virus that has completely devastated New York City (in the future). Alone with no one but his dog (his wife and daughter were killed), and a variety of strategically placed mannequins, Nevell appears to be handling solitude, as anyone would (with a touch of madness). In a city filled with deer, wild animals (they obviously got out of the Zoo), Nevell spends his days hunting those that are ill, and his nights hiding out in his well fortified home. Unfortunately, things change as we see other survivors and the very beings that Nevell thought were so unintelligent (and without meaningful brain activity) being more intelligent (well at least the leader) than first believed.I enjoyed this story, although I wasn't particularly fond of the ending.

This graphic novel for a hollywood movie doesn't go 100% sappy or happy ending on us, it shows pain.  Also cash cow Will Smith isn't such a cliche character.

I knew this ever since Fresh Prince when Carlton accidently took pills from Will's locker and needed his stomach pumped, or when his dad didn't show up when he was supposed to, Will Smith crying can get to you, he is a good actor.  Besides being a good actor as I mentioned he is a cash cow every film he is makes around $100 mil, with I am Legend topping $200 mil, Adam Sandler is another safe bet at the box office, although I'm not loving his movies.I expected amazing sound out of this blu ray, however the movie isn't trying to be transformers, it's the end of the world, how loud could it be?

Scientists think they find a viral cure for cancer, and like other viruses it can jump from person to person (aside from the few with immunity).  The unintended side effects are the people it does not kill outright turn into vampires.  Smith's character is alone (aside from his dog) in New York City, trying to find a cure for the virus.Smith does a great job playing a guy who is clearly going crazy from being by himself for three years, yet, is brilliant in his moments of lucidity when he works on the cure.  It is one of the better acting jobs he has done in his career.  The reason I like the alternate version is that it fleshes out the story of whether the vampires are becoming sentient beings vs just mindless killing machines.  It really goes deeper into the ethical dilemma of whether it is right to ""cure"" them.  It is a question that the film does not really answer in either version, but it does make you think.Apparently the movie diverges a lot from the source books, which upset a lot of fans.  If that is something that would take away from your enjoyment of the movie, then you should probably skip this.  If however you are a fan of Will Smith the sci-fi kind of dramas and stories (especially ones that do make you think some) and can let the movie stand on its own, you will probably find this enjoyable.

657326,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B00005JPTK,Mike Zimmerman,"[5, 8]","In 2009, a dangerous virus spread through New York City and, possibly, the entire world. Now the entire human race has either died or turned into creatures who are impervious to light. Except for one survivor, scientist Robert Neville (Will Smith). For three years, he's been trying to find a way to reverse the effects and hopefully bring humanity back to normal. During his latest roundabout, he was trapped in his car and was about to be attacked when a surviving family (Alice Braga, Charlie Tahan) rescues him from certain doom. Unfortunately, the bloodsuckers have followed. Now Neville must make a last stand, because he would rather die trying than become one of them.While I wouldn't call I Am Legend a classic in filmmaking, it sure had me riveted. Based on a classic novel by Richard Matheson, and directed by Constantine helmer Francis Lawrence, Legend is a doomsday movie mixed with frightening chills, a reliable performance from Will Smith, and hardly any exposition (made better by the fact that dialogue is minimal).Legend is hardly considered a blockbuster actioner by any means. While it has Smith, guns, and special effects, this isn't ""Men in Black"" meets 30 Days of Night. More or less, it's a combination of ""The Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man"" (which the source material was previously adapted), and it focuses on top-notch horror sets (much like ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" and ""30 Days of Night"", the shocks come quick rather than being cheap), a sense of claustrophobia, and biting commentary about racial relations that figures into the story (at least I think it does).And concerning the vampires, Lawrence also outdid himself as well. Since this is a big-budget film, unlike ""30 Days of Night"", the blood-sucking creatures are rendered in full CGI, and have little to do but scream and snarl. And that's fine with me, because it benefactors into the need to just be a good-ol-fashioned fright fest.Even better is the fact that it doesn't have any major stars backing it up. This is Will Smith's movie through-and-through, and Lawrence made a wise decision not to have him channel the Fresh Prince in a action/horror movie. As I said, the film focuses less on flat-out explaining the story, and more time to flesh out Smith's character, allowing the drama to breathe, while still throwing in action and horror sets all the way through.As I stress, for those seeking a popcorn-munching action fest, you may be partially right. But the film has more on its mind than just cheap thrills. This is probably why the film won't be memorable, but to be PG-13 and dead-on thrilling (compared to the idiotic thrillers recently dumped into theaters), consider Lawrence not one of the hacks in the business.",5,"""God didn't do this.

And hope.  Will Smith turns in a landmark performance as Dr. Robert Neville, the sole survivor in a New York City decimated by a man-made plague.  During the day, Neville and his faithful dog travel the city for sustenance and spiritual survival.  The images of a downtown Manhattan crumbling and decaying are downright chilling.  But in the dark corners await bloodthirsty monsters that were transformed by the plague from ordinary humans to something more primitive, feral and terrifying.  Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) and gifted cinematographer Andrew Lesnie (The Lord of the Rings) construct nerve-frying, blood-freezing sequences in an abandoned building and a New York seaport at night when Neville finds himself face to face with the cannibalistic creatures.  But Neville's true fight is not with them or with the disease he so fervently tries to cure; it's with his own dissipating sanity.  Where the film works best is when it let's Smith work his Hanksian magic, chronicling Neville's daily routine (talking to Manicheans as if they were real, waiting in seeming vain at the aforementioned seaport for any sign of life) to fight off absolute desolation.  Smith finds the ravaged, fragile soul of a man fighting for one more day, one more fleeting chance that hope will reveal itself.  When Lawrence and his screenwriters stick with this bleak, desperate story for survival, ""I Am Legend"" connects with unexpected emotional body blows.  The predictable deus ex machina ending blunts the emotional impact shows, but until then, ""I Am Legend"" is a harrowing vision of a future where hope hangs by a vulnerable thread.",4,"Will Smith Shines in a Harrowing, if Flawed, ""Legend""",1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,1779,"['unearned', 'sentimentality', 'end', 'Am', 'Legend', 'then', 'spine-tingling', 'vision', 'future', 'devoid', 'humanity', 'hope', 'Will', 'Smith', 'turns', 'landmark', 'performance', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'sole', 'survivor', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'decimated', 'man-made', 'plague', 'day', 'Neville', 'faithful', 'dog', 'travel', 'city', 'sustenance', 'spiritual', 'survival', 'images', 'downtown', 'Manhattan', 'crumbling', 'decaying', 'are', 'downright', 'chilling', 'dark', 'corners', 'await', 'bloodthirsty', 'monsters', 'were', 'transformed', 'plague', 'ordinary', 'humans', 'something', 'more', 'primitive', 'feral', 'terrifying', 'Director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'Constantine', 'gifted', 'cinematographer', 'Andrew', 'Lesnie', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'construct', 'nerve-frying', 'blood-freezing', 'sequences', 'abandoned', 'building', 'New', 'York', 'seaport', 'night', 'when', 'Neville', 'face', 'face', 'cannibalistic', 'creatures', 'Neville', 'true', 'fight', 'not', 'disease', 'so', 'fervently', 'cure', 'own', 'dissipating', 'sanity', 'Where', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'let', 'Smith', 'work', 'Hanksian', 'magic', 'chronicling', 'Neville', 'daily', 'routine', 'talking', 'Manicheans', 'were', 'real', 'waiting', 'seeming', 'vain', 'aforementioned', 'seaport', 'sign', 'life', 'fight', 'off', 'desolation', 'Smith', 'ravaged', 'fragile', 'soul', 'man', 'fighting', 'one', 'more', 'day', 'one', 'more', 'fleeting', 'chance', 'hope', 'will', 'reveal', 'When', 'Lawrence', 'screenwriters', 'stick', 'bleak', 'desperate', 'story', 'survival', 'Am', 'Legend', 'connects', 'unexpected', 'emotional', 'body', 'blows', 'predictable', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'ending', 'blunts', 'emotional', 'impact', 'shows', 'then', 'Am', 'Legend', 'harrowing', 'vision', 'future', 'where', 'hope', 'hangs', 'vulnerable', 'thread']",I Am Legend

I Am Legend Iamlegendbigposter was a huge hit in theaters and by not seeing it, avoiding spoilers for so long was difficult. As a fan of film criticism, I enjoy reading movie reviews, even for movies I haven't seen. So, going into watching this, I was already aware of the basic plot and story elements.For those who haven't seen the film or don't know anything about it, I Am Legend is the third film adaptation of a 1954 story of the same name by Richard Matheson. The story is about Robert Neville, the last remaining human in New York following a massive man-made infectious outbreak (the Krippen Virus) that killed billions of people and turned the surviving millions into night wandering zombie-like creatures that eventually killed the few immune. Neville, a former virologist and army Colonel, is immune to the disease and spends everyday trying to find a cure through experimental vaccination tests, and every night hiding in his house which has been fortified like a modern day military base.An empty and dilapidated New York City is hauntingly beautiful. It brings to mind Alan Weisman's The World Without Us, a story about how nature would take the Earth back if humans did not exist. Director Francis Lawrence gives us breathtaking views of a city falling apart, yet still maintaining its beauty. Humorously, the man-made features that remain in tact the most are billboards that serve as ""Easter Eggs"" for the dorks in the audience (me included), like a poster for a Batman/ Superman movie coming out in 2010.What I wasn't aware of before seeing the movie was the most enjoyable part, the character development. Echoing, isolationist characteristics and story arcs of Cast Away, Will Smith gives a wonderful performance as Robert Neville. We're given even greater depth into Neville's character through a series of flashbacks throughout the film that detail Neville's current state of mind.Neville creates as much artificial human contact as possible in his isolation through the use of placing mannequins in normal daily interaction situations. The scenes in the video store are some of the most truthful scenes of the movies giving a window into Neville's loneliness.It's hard to imagine how we would act in a similar situation, but as a dog owner I know that I would rely as much on my dog as Neville does on his, Sam. Sam, a German Shepherd, is immune to the airborne strain of the virus, but not the strain transmitted through a bite. I_am_legend_will_smith__1_ Sam is as powerful of a character as Neville and through masterful storytelling and direction, the audience feels as attached to a dog as we do to the human lead. During the hunting scene we are offered our first glimpse of the infected, the terror that grips the audience not only from the fear on Neville's face, but the fear you can feel in his heart of losing his only friend.As a dog owner, the fear of losing your pet that you love is a scary thought. Lawrence does a wonderful job of building suspense around Sam and Neville's equal need of each other and the terror that surrounds the chance of losing one another.While Neville suspects that the infected have finally stopped showing any signs of human characteristics, he meets one infected that confuses him, showing signs of human cognition and planning. After a trap is sprung and Neville is injured, the dramatic tension quickly rises as swiftly as the sun sets. As Neville and Sam try to flee to their car, a few infected dogs wait at the fading edge of a sunbeam for their chance to strike.(SPOILER- Skip until the end of the alert)This scene begins the end of Neville's remaining desire to live. Iamlegendphoto21While fighting the infected dogs for his life, Neville continues to see Sam locked in a vicious fight with another dog, resulting in multiple bites and wounds. In what is by far the most difficult scene to watch and emotionally difficult, Neville tries to make Sam comfortable while seeing if a vaccinated test can stave of the infection. While Sam lays in Neville's arms dying and slowly becoming infected, tears stream down Neville's face. Neville's only choice to kill Sam the moment Sam has become fully infected.This scene is amazingly well done. Smith's performance of saving his own life, while trying to end Sam's is heart breaking. As he end's Sam's life, you can see Neville's last hopes leave his eyes in the tears streaming down his face.(END OF SPOILERS)From this point on, the movie shifts into a more action oriented theme, but does not totally abandon its prior success. I Am Legend can easily be seen as two films, the first a movie of isolation and how a lone human struggles to maintain his sanity, the second a more typical Hollywood action-thriller.BfwillWe are introduced to two new characters in the second half of the film, both of which are too little too late. Their symbolism is important, but their use in the movie could have been improved. The performances aren't on the same level as Smith's or even Sam's and it's difficult to feel any emotional attachment to them. Their symbolic presence of hope to Neville is important, as a glimpse of normality and his path to a cure and ultimately is his root to spiritual salvation.Like the new characters the climax doesn't stir the same tense feeling initially felt in the first half. As a whole, the movie is very enjoyable, but loses focus in the end. It would be easier to grade the film by its two thematic segments, the first half getting 5 stars, the second half getting 3 stars. Despite its thematic collapse at the end, I Am Legend offers far more enjoyable moments to outweigh its faults and is a movie worth seeing.",4,A tale of two films...,1206403200,"03 25,

I've always had a fascination with EOW, not that I'm morbid, I just believe it is an inevitable scenario. One day, humanity as we know it, will be drastically altered. Perhaps viral, or perhaps ecological. No, not global warming. I'm talking asteroids, here. At any rate, a thousand years from now, maybe even ten thousand years from now, or maybe even tomorrow, some catastrophic event will bring about the destruction of society and decimation of mankind.As with virtually all EOW stories that evolve from print to film, I AM LEGEND, the movie, falls far short of the book. That's NOT to say that the movie is not worth seeing, or even not enjoyable. It was actually quite enjoyable for me and maybe even one of the better EOW movies made to date. But....There's always a `but' right? The movie falls short on several fronts. There is too much time spent on scenes which really fail to contribute much to the story, and not enough time spent explaining important details. There is a brief elusion to God and His plan for humanity, but that shred of promising storyline is short lived. I never like to give away too much in a review, so I'll not go further into the story itself.Now here's what this movie does offer. Suspense, drama, fast cars, good verses evil, high tech weaponry, zombie-like humanoids and everything else one might expect. The filming is good, special effects are first rate.

It's hard to believe as you watch this film unravel from near masterpiece to typical Hollywood action fare.The film is interesting and entertaining to a point, it just has a very unsatisfying ending and it could have used some narration. The narration could have helped explain some things going on, like where are the generators for electricity you have in your house and what is that stuff he poured on his steps etc.etc. etc.?! The CGI creatures are not all that convincing, but I could have lived with that had the film followed the original story.

And while this one did fall short, it was much betterthan I had expected. The special effects are better than the original, but given 40+ years difference they ought to be.The main saving grace of this film is Will Smith. He`s an excellent actor and he did a good job on this movie. In his role as RobertNeville, he really made you believe that he had been alone for three years. A little lost, a little robotic, a little crazy. Justabout what you would expect of a person who had been through something like that.

Spitzer ""mas017""","[1, 3]","I AM LEGEND could have been a classic film.But it fell flat.... a terrible loss of potential.First the good....1) The scenery work making New York look like a wasteland deserves an oscar. Very well done.2) Will Smith has matured into a very good actor and did well in this film.3) The film borrowed heavily from the Vincent Price film version of this sci-fi classic which is a good thing.Now the BAD..........1) CGI ""dark seekers"".Hollywood needs to put away the ""gee-whiz"" gimmickery and sometimes focus on real film making again.These cartoon-looking ""monsters"" looked so goofy and like the Zombies in the old SEGA video game ""House of the Dead"" that any feeling of dread and gloom that were established by the great scenery was lost.CGI is still not to the level technologically where it can be used for humans or characters meant to strike a chord of reality or feeling.That's what killed the HULK, recent remake of KING KONG and some other recent films.You simply can't connect or feel ""what I am seeing is real"" when they are visually divorced from reality.Smith's other film ""I-ROBOT"" suffered that same problem.2) SPOILER ALERT -.....................When Sam, the dog dies...... so does the apparent pacing of the movie.Others have had the same comment on here.... It seems the 2nd half of the movie pales in comparison to the first.The plot device used to get rid of Sam, was too contrived.ie.... Smith's character get's snared in a trap.Then awakens just at sunset.When he gets down... you ask yourself ............... Okay Buddy why don't you hop on your one good leg ??But NO.... he drags  across the ground until the dark seekers come out and attack them.... THEN afterwards of course when the damage is done, he is able to limp on that same leg and even carry Sam.My wife kept complaining.... ""Great the dog dies because he is too stupid to hop on his one good leg and get out of there. They should have re-shot that scene differently"".In summary it seems they had the budget to work with, but somehow the film fell FLAT and was OK..... but it is not memorable and will probably be forgotten with time.Even allowing for it's old age.... We feel the 1956 Vincent Price version of this film ""Last Man On Earth"" actually had a stronger feeling of pathos than this remake.But this new film COULD have been a classic if they maintained the mood of the first 40 minutes and did not turn the movie into a CGI fun-festPS...The ALTERNATE ENDING is FAR SUPERIOR to the theatrical ""Happy Hollywood"" ending and while not identical to the message of the novel, does both capture the general message best and also matches the mood of the rest of the film.The theatrical ending really weakened the film and seems like a mismatch tacked on at the end.The ""alternate ending"" alone boosts the rating of this film 1-2 stars.",3,Hmmmm.....

657345,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00005JPTK,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 1]","The long in development I Am Legend is a flawed yet entertaining adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic horror novel, and while this is undoubtedly the best version of Matheson's work to be filmed (don't get me started on The Omega Man), the potential for what I Am Legend could have been makes it slightly disappointing.  Will Smith stars as military scientist Robert Neville, who very well may be the last man on Earth.  Along with his dog Sam, Neville searches for a way to save humanity, which has been reduced to a vampiric race after a cancer vaccine went awry three years earlier.  Where I Am Legend works is first and foremost with Smith, who is so good as the isolated, lonely, and desperate Neville that he alone will keep you glued to the screen.  Smith's performance ranks as one of his best, as sometimes we forget just how good an actor the man is, he reminds us again here.  The visions of a desolate, unpopulated New York City is also one of the film's strengths, offering some very impressive visuals.  Where I Am Legend fails however is with the directing of Constantine director Frances Lawrence, whose action scenes are made worse thanks to some surprisingly lacking digital effects work.  I Am Legend could really have been something special here, regardless of how much it departs from Matheson's book, but alas, it just isn't.  Still though, I Am Legend isn't bad one bit, and the alternate theatrical cut included in this two-disc set is even better than the regular cut.  All in all, I Am Legend is definitely worth a look whether you are a fan of Will Smith's or a fan of Matheson's work, but be prepared to start thinking of what could have been after the credits start rolling.",3,Oh what might have been...,1206057600,"03 21, 2008",2008,1707,"['long', 'development', 'Am', 'Legend', 'flawed', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'adaptation', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'classic', 'horror', 'novel', 'undoubtedly', 'best', 'version', 'Matheson', 'work', 'be', 'filmed', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'Omega', 'Man', 'potential', 'what', 'Am', 'Legend', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'Will', 'Smith', 'stars', 'military', 'scientist', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'who', 'very', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'man', 'Earth', 'dog', 'Sam', 'Neville', 'way', 'save', 'humanity', 'been', 'reduced', 'vampiric', 'race', 'cancer', 'vaccine', 'went', 'awry', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'Where', 'Am', 'Legend', 'works', 'first', 'foremost', 'Smith', 'who', 'so', 'good', 'isolated', 'lonely', 'desperate', 'Neville', 'alone', 'will', 'keep', 'glued', 'screen', 'Smith', 'performance', 'ranks', 'one', 'best', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'actor', 'man', 'again', 'here', 'visions', 'desolate', 'unpopulated', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'also', 'one', 'film', 'strengths', 'offering', 'very', 'impressive', 'visuals', 'Where', 'Am', 'Legend', 'however', 'directing', 'Constantine', 'director', 'Frances', 'Lawrence', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'made', 'worse', 'thanks', 'surprisingly', 'lacking', 'digital', 'effects', 'work', 'Am', 'Legend', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'special', 'here', 'regardless', 'how', 'much', 'Matheson', 'book', 'alas', 'just', ""n't"", 'Still', 'Am', 'Legend', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'bit', 'alternate', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'included', 'two-disc', 'set', 'even', 'better', 'regular', 'cut', 'Am', 'Legend', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'are', 'fan', 'Will', 'Smith', 'fan', 'Matheson', 'work', 'be', 'prepared', 'start', 'thinking', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling']",I Am Legend

657348,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B00005JPTK,Newton Ooi,"[3, 3]","I Am Legend is another action flick release by Will Smith.  This time Mr. Smith stars as Robert Neville, a US military scientist who helped create a virus-based vaccine against cancer that ends up becoming contagious, spreading to the entire human population, killing of 90% of humans, and turning most of the survivors into cannibalistic, light-hating creatures; i.e. vampire - zombies called Darkseekers.  Most of the movie takes place in New York City, specifically in Neville's town home, and in the streets and buildings of Manhattan.The drawbacks of the movie are primarily in the plot; specifically there are some very dumb scenes.  Probably the biggest is the lack of firepower wielded by Dr. Neville.  We learn in the movie that Dr. Neville happens to be an Army officer.  We also see that Dr. Neville has been living alone in NYC for several years, often fighting of Darkseekers.  Dr. Neville also has a lot of time every single day to drive thru the city, stop of at music and DVD stores to ""rent"" movies and CD's, arrange various store mannequins to provide him ""company"", play golf, and chase animals that have escaped from the local zoos.  Yet in the entire movie, Dr. Neville has only three guns on him, an automatic rifle, and two handguns.  For someone living in a city full of zombies that want to eat him, who has military training, and who has a lot of time to acquire firearms in a city that must be full of gun shops, I would think Dr. Neville would be loaded with guns.  In the final scene when the Darkseekers storm his house, he uses a grand total of 1 gun with 1 clip, and 1 grenade.  This is preposterous.  I would have hundreds of firearms in that house, several per room, with lots of ammunition clips around.A second stupid scene in the movie is when Dr. Nevill falls into the Darkseekers' trap and gets strung up by his leg.  For a sober Army officer to fall into such a simple trap is ludicrous and mind-boggling.Probably the dumbest part of the movie is why doesn't Dr. Neville start demolishing the hiding places of the Darkseekers.  He clearly knows how to construct and use explosives, as shown in the movie's climax.  And he clearly has the time to do this, so why does he not start blowing up various dark spots throughout the city as a way of clearing out the Darkseekers?So all in all, this is a movie with a great premise and good acting, but some big plot holes that lead to very stupid scenes.",3,"Great premise, good acting, too many dumb scenes",1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,2436,"['Am', 'Legend', 'action', 'flick', 'release', 'Will', 'Smith', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'US', 'military', 'scientist', 'who', 'helped', 'create', 'virus-based', 'vaccine', 'cancer', 'up', 'becoming', 'contagious', 'spreading', 'entire', 'human', 'population', 'killing', '90', '%', 'humans', 'turning', 'most', 'survivors', 'cannibalistic', 'light-hating', 'creatures', 'i.e', 'vampire', 'zombies', 'called', 'Darkseekers', 'Most', 'movie', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'specifically', 'Neville', 'town', 'home', 'streets', 'buildings', 'Manhattan.The', 'drawbacks', 'movie', 'are', 'primarily', 'plot', 'specifically', 'are', 'very', 'dumb', 'scenes', 'Probably', 'biggest', 'lack', 'firepower', 'wielded', 'Dr.', 'Neville', 'learn', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'Neville', 'be', 'Army', 'officer', 'also', 'see', 'Dr.', 'Neville', 'been', 'living', 'alone', 'NYC', 'several', 'years', 'often', 'fighting', 'Darkseekers', 'Dr.', 'Neville', 'also', 'lot', 'time', 'single', 'day', 'drive', 'thru', 'city', 'stop', 'music', 'DVD', 'stores', 'rent', 'movies', 'CD', 'arrange', 'various', 'store', 'mannequins', 'provide', 'company', 'play', 'golf', 'chase', 'animals', 'have', 'escaped', 'local', 'zoos', 'entire', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'Neville', 'only', 'three', 'guns', 'automatic', 'rifle', 'two', 'handguns', 'someone', 'living', 'city', 'full', 'zombies', 'want', 'eat', 'who', 'military', 'training', 'who', 'lot', 'time', 'acquire', 'firearms', 'city', 'must', 'be', 'full', 'gun', 'shops', 'would', 'think', 'Dr.', 'Neville', 'would', 'be', 'loaded', 'guns', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'Darkseekers', 'storm', 'house', 'grand', 'total', '1', 'gun', '1', 'clip', '1', 'grenade', 'preposterous', 'would', 'have', 'hundreds', 'firearms', 'house', 'several', 'room', 'lots', 'ammunition', 'clips', 'around.A', 'second', 'stupid', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Nevill', 'Darkseekers', 'trap', 'strung', 'up', 'leg', 'sober', 'Army', 'officer', 'fall', 'such', 'simple', 'trap', 'ludicrous', 'mind-boggling.Probably', 'dumbest', 'part', 'movie', 'why', ""n't"", 'Dr.', 'Neville', 'start', 'demolishing', 'hiding', 'places', 'Darkseekers', 'clearly', 'how', 'construct', 'use', 'explosives', 'shown', 'movie', 'climax', 'clearly', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'start', 'blowing', 'up', 'various', 'dark', 'spots', 'city', 'way', 'clearing', 'out', 'Darkseekers', 'So', 'all', 'movie', 'great', 'premise', 'good', 'acting', 'big', 'plot', 'holes', 'lead', 'very', 'stupid', 'scenes']",I Am Legend

All they have to do is to make the book from Richard Matheson into a film and don't add anything or take anything. Yet both times they have tampered with the material and both times they end up producing less than average results.A doctor finds himself almost alone in a city trying to find a cure for a cure for cancer that has gone horribly wrong turning people into starving rabid but rapid zombie-ish type creatures that run through the night killing people. The action sequences are mostly of the nightstalker hunting or cure finding sort. Lots of the time Will Smith is left talking to himself, his dog or having flashbacks before the plague.This latest attempt at I am Legend is not an outright disaster. The empty New York set design and Will Smith do save the dodgy CGI nightstalkers and a script that simply deviates too much from the original concept. It is still something you can watch, maybe even enjoy at times, but that is not the point. This is not I am Legend and that is bad because this simply isn't the film we wanted to see and it's the second time Hollywood has got it terribly wrong.

Why did the zombie do it? All of these shenanigans fall by the wayside quicker than a sunbathing vampire when the love interest arrives. The wheels fall off the film, which lurches to a less dignified end than an old fashioned zombie with no underpants on.  Which is a shame because this film could have been pretty good.

It turns out that the cure actually becomes a biochemical disease and wipes people out at an alarming rate and those who aren't killed are turned into zombies. Robert Neville (Will Smith) believes he is the last survivor and spends his days in New York City attempting to find a cure for the disease and his nights avoiding the zombies.I was actually expecting a lot more out of this movie. I had read rave reviews and heard first hand accounts from friends about this films greatness. What I witnessed was an average post apocalyptic type story with in my opinion sub par special effects.The Good:  Will Smith's acting was enjoyable. The idea of the movie was good.The Bad: Probably my biggest gripe with this move is the special effects. They were generally unconvincing throughout. I think that much more of the special effects should have been done practically instead of all of the CG. The zombies would have been better as practical instead of CG. The lions in the beginning, the grass growing up through the street and all of the little touches were obvious CG and the quality was so poor that the items that are animated became glaring. The zombies were very reminiscent of the creatures in ""The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition)"". That was fine almost 9 years ago but hasn't CG gotten better since then? You wouldn't guess that by watching ""I am Legend"".Some of the plot turns seem a little bit forced. This isn't a spoiler but Will is constantly trying to shoot deer in this movie by chasing them down with his car. Why didn't he just use some of the corn he was growing as a bait pile and wait for them to come to him? Why chase them in a car or with your dog when you can get them to come to you?Overall: This was OK but is very over hyped in my opinion.

657365,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B00005JPTK,Paulo Leite,"[1, 2]","Obviously things are a matter of taste. Some people love it, some people hate it, other just don't care.There is something deliciously horrible to watch our cities being destroyed in the movies. It is like a guilty pleasure. Some uncontrollable curiosity that leaves us in awe before the unusual. It may be looking at a car accident as we drive by or watching New York City being destroyed by the sea inDeep Impact (Special Collector's Edition), by a monster inCloverfield [Theatrical Release] or by the ultimate storm inThe Day After Tomorrow (Two-Disc All-Access Collector's Edition). It is a pleasure to see the impossible happen with the visual accuracy of certainty while deep inside we know it only lasts for two hours.I AM LEGEND gives you that guilty pleasure... with a twist: the city is not really destroyed. It is Humans who are absent after a deadly disease has wiped us out. And after that, Nature starts to reclaim the Earth. In fact, one of the most powerful images of this film is in the beginning, when Dr. Neville (Smith) drives a Mustang across the city and gets surprised by deers running scared through the streets on Manhattan. Even more disturbing is to see Dr. Neville moving across the woods in Times Square (no less) as he hunts one of them.This is just one of I AM LEGEND's greatest achievements: it really gives us a world (through state-of-the-art visual effects) unseen, unimaginable, fascinating... and lets you explore it. We know there are vampires (or some creatures like that running havoc through the night). But during daytime, we go places and see things we'll never see. And that's pure film magic.So here is the story: Dr. Robert Neville lives alone in Manhattan as the sole survivor to a deadly virus (to which he is immune) who transformed everybody in light-sensitive vampire-like monsters (forced to live in the dark). The crisis (shown in flashbacks as he recollects) happened a few years ago and - right now - Dr. Neville is on the verge of loosing his mind. He talks to mannequins, watches recorded television broadcast and try to have a normal life (with his dog Samantha) hoping to make contact with other survivors like himself. Oh... and he is a military scientist trying to find a cure.Now... it is a ridiculous effort to compare the film to the book, as this film is much more a loose adaptation of Richard Matheson's great novella. This film uses the same premise but makes significant changes in key elements that (I believe) would never really work on a Hollywood blockbuster. So, those who love the novella and hate the film should realize that, many many times, the film's preoccupations and objectives are not the same ones we have on the books they are based on. It is important to appreciate the film in its own merit and outside the burden of the book - a burden any film wants to break free from. Gone are the days where a Hollywood film ""wanted to be the book"" because they needed such blessing from such an authority.And breaking down the film's great assets, we'll find only positive elements: Will Smith's very precise performance, a screenplay who tell you the story minute by minute maintaining you always wanting more, great special effects, great scary moments that will please its target audience... and the city we love being engulfed by a destiny without us.Simply beautiful.This DVD version comes with lots of extras, the best of which, in my opinion, is the making of the city's visuals we see throughout the entire movie.

If you have the empathy and fortitude to stay with him it is a gut-wrenching ride through sorrows, sanity, and insanity. Smith plays a strong character who sticks with it against all odds and keeps going even when he sees no hope. His hero is Bob Marley with his fortitude fighting against all odds and this links a sci-fi dilemma to the dispair that seems to characterize our times.BE WARNED: This is not entertainment as such. It is slowly paced and in this will probably appeal only to mature adults who have the capacity to get empathetically into lonely characters. So it cannot be called an action film. The sci-fi is not escapist or impressively high tech.The sci-fi is a thin vehicle for exposition of a human being. The dialogue does not seem for the most part important, though the situations themselves certainly are important to the acting. The ending is not sensational.I found it to be more an ordeal to watch than entertaining because there was constant tension and emotional suffering. I had to decide whether to stick with it or walk out. But it was well worth sticking with it to see a great artist given a rare chance to carry a substantial film.  I liked Crusoe for this reason, but Smith beat that and there is much more substance to Legend. I would say the same comparing it to Castaway. I appreciated the directing and editing here to be sure.Unfortunately Legend is probably not a popcorn seller, but I hope that enough of the film-making and acting art in it will show through at the box office to encourage other talented American actors and directors nevertheless to get a chance to show their stuff.",5,Acting classic,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,1706,"['Will', 'Smith', 'remarkable', 'memorable', 'job', 'acting', 'Am', 'Legend', 'have', 'empathy', 'fortitude', 'stay', 'gut-wrenching', 'ride', 'sorrows', 'sanity', 'insanity', 'Smith', 'strong', 'character', 'who', 'odds', 'going', 'even', 'when', 'hope', 'hero', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'fortitude', 'fighting', 'odds', 'sci-fi', 'dilemma', 'dispair', 'characterize', 'times.BE', 'WARNED', 'not', 'entertainment', 'such', 'slowly', 'paced', 'will', 'probably', 'appeal', 'only', 'mature', 'adults', 'who', 'have', 'capacity', 'get', 'empathetically', 'lonely', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'action', 'film', 'sci-fi', 'not', 'escapist', 'impressively', 'high', 'tech.The', 'sci-fi', 'thin', 'vehicle', 'exposition', 'human', 'being', 'dialogue', 'not', 'seem', 'most', 'part', 'important', 'situations', 'certainly', 'are', 'important', 'acting', 'ending', 'not', 'sensational.I', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'ordeal', 'watch', 'entertaining', 'was', 'constant', 'tension', 'emotional', 'suffering', 'had', 'decide', 'stick', 'walk', 'out', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'sticking', 'see', 'great', 'artist', 'given', 'rare', 'chance', 'carry', 'substantial', 'film', 'liked', 'Crusoe', 'reason', 'Smith', 'beat', 'much', 'more', 'substance', 'Legend', 'would', 'say', 'same', 'comparing', 'Castaway', 'appreciated', 'directing', 'editing', 'here', 'be', 'sure.Unfortunately', 'Legend', 'probably', 'not', 'popcorn', 'seller', 'hope', 'enough', 'film-making', 'acting', 'art', 'will', 'show', 'box', 'office', 'encourage', 'other', 'talented', 'American', 'actors', 'directors', 'nevertheless', 'get', 'chance', 'show', 'stuff']",I Am Legend

I never read the book, I didn't care about the plot or who was acting, I just wanted to see how the movie depicted post-apocalyptic New York. I'm probably a bit older than a lot of posters so my visual acuity may leave something to be desired, but I enjoyed the scenes of a weed-covered, delapidated, once-great city. Then I found myself enjoying Will Smith's acting. Then I found myself interested in the plot. Had fun cringing as the vampirical mutants menaced the last remnants of civilization.But then...(SPOILER ALERT)...The Brazilian lady and the boy showed up. Right there and then, the whole thing tanked. They were totally out of place and completely interrupted the flow of the film. What really got me was the conversation where the woman keeps insisting there's a survivor colony in Vermont, and Legend keeps telling her that's crazy. Finally he says: ""How do you know there's *anything* left anywhere at all?"" [paraphrase].Her: ""God told me.""Me: ""WTF????""That was just so all wrong. First we're in a post-Armageddon, deserted wasteland, devoid of all hope, then we're watching an episode of *The 700 Club*? What's wrong with that picture? What's even wronger is that Legend ends up believing the Deity-channeling woman, and that she somehow knows without a map just how to get to the survivor colony. C'mon, how much more contrived and heavy-handed could you get? That just blew it all to H3ll for me. Nothing seemed believable after the woman and boy showed up. That's unfortunate because the beginning of the movie had a lot of promise. I would rent the DVD to watch with someone who'd never seen it, but I wouldn't buy it, and I'd have to attach a lot of caveats to recommend it to a friend.

But I Am Legend falls victim to two things plaguing Hollywood these days:- Overreliance on CGI: This movie would have been much better served using live actors than CGI. The ""uncanny valley"" phenomenon is epitomized in this film, and the reliance on computer imaging takes away from the experience.- Bittersweet ending: Those who have read Richard Matheson's novel know that there is no bittersweet ending involved. Instead, the movie took a turn for the worse in the second half with the introduction of a seemingly useless character who serves only as a plot device. The holes punched into the storyline by her addition show the absurdity of changing the original plot.This is worth a rental, but ultimately I walked out of the theater disappointed by the second half of the movie.

Indeed, the glaring awfulness of the computer-rendered deer is enough to make you forget all about the beautiful post-plague New York cityscapes (in themselves worthy of huge praise, they're chilling and very impressive), the thitherto-great performance by Smith as a man hounded by loneliness and personal demons, and the very cute Alsatian by his side.But with further viewing, ""I Am Legend"" becomes much, much better - for the most part - and is, by the time the credits roll, not Just Another Action Movie, but something more enjoyable - if two-dimensional.The Good: Smith gives a gorgeous, nuanced performance as plague survivor Robert Neville - when he's allowed to act, that is. When he's forced to shoot, run, chase, do action - he reverts to a horrible sort of MIB stereotype - but during Robert Neville's more emotionally complex scenes he's actually excellent. Director Francis Lawerence does great things with the aforementioned bare New York of the future, and we can really sense the isolation and loneliness of Neville's plight. And yes, there are several worthwhile ""jump"" moments, too, with which to keep the action moving along nicely. It's just a shame that most of the action is hackneyed - which leads me toThe Bad: Boring chase & evade sequences and frankly ridiculous computer animations (the animals are a minor offender: the crown of stupidity in this case belongs squarely planted on the heads of the totally unrealistic, poorly-animated Zombies) ruin the great work of Smith and his director in ""I Am Legend"". Also, the ending is very hackneyed - I'm not sure if it's reflective of the novel since I haven't read it - but as a movie, we've seen it all before.Still, criticisms notwithstanding, ""I Am Legend"" is a worthwhile way to pass an evening's viewing: I wouldn't buy the DVD because no amount of extras could make up for the fact that, while enjoyable enough with all-too-brief moments of excellence, ""I Am Legend"" is just not engaging enough to watch twice.",2,"Great in parts, otherwise very pedestrian",1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,2275,"['moment', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel', 'Air', 'line', 'vision', 'complete', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'four', 'thousand', 'CGI', 'deer', 'oh', 'also', 'pride', 'fake', 'lions', ""'d"", 'be', 'very', 'forgiven', 'thinking', 'Am', 'Legend', 'going', 'be', 'Just', 'Action', 'Movie', 'Indeed', 'glaring', 'awfulness', 'computer-rendered', 'deer', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'beautiful', 'post-plague', 'New', 'York', 'cityscapes', 'worthy', 'huge', 'praise', ""'re"", 'chilling', 'very', 'impressive', 'thitherto-great', 'performance', 'Smith', 'man', 'hounded', 'loneliness', 'personal', 'demons', 'very', 'cute', 'Alsatian', 'side.But', 'further', 'viewing', 'Am', 'Legend', 'becomes', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'part', 'time', 'credits', 'roll', 'not', 'Just', 'Action', 'Movie', 'something', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'two-dimensional.The', 'Good', 'Smith', 'gorgeous', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'plague', 'survivor', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'when', 'allowed', 'act', 'When', 'forced', 'shoot', 'run', 'chase', 'do', 'action', 'horrible', 'sort', 'MIB', 'stereotype', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'more', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'scenes', 'actually', 'excellent', 'Director', 'Francis', 'Lawerence', 'great', 'things', 'aforementioned', 'bare', 'New', 'York', 'future', 'can', 'really', 'sense', 'isolation', 'loneliness', 'Neville', 'plight', 'yes', 'are', 'several', 'jump', 'moments', 'too', 'keep', 'action', 'moving', 'along', 'nicely', 'just', 'shame', 'most', 'action', 'hackneyed', 'toThe', 'Bad', 'Boring', 'chase', 'evade', 'sequences', 'frankly', 'ridiculous', 'computer', 'animations', 'animals', 'are', 'minor', 'offender', 'crown', 'stupidity', 'case', 'squarely', 'planted', 'heads', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'poorly-animated', 'Zombies', 'ruin', 'great', 'work', 'Smith', 'director', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Also', 'ending', 'very', 'hackneyed', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'reflective', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.Still', 'criticisms', 'notwithstanding', 'Am', 'Legend', 'worthwhile', 'way', 'pass', 'evening', 'viewing', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'amount', 'extras', 'could', 'make', 'up', 'fact', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'all-too-brief', 'moments', 'excellence', 'Am', 'Legend', 'just', 'not', 'engaging', 'enough', 'watch', 'twice']",I Am Legend

The doctor's manic mission is to find a cure for plague. He is on his own, except for his trusted dog, left behind by his family when they fled New York.The doctor is played by Will Smith, and he has to carry most of the movie on his own. And carry it he does. He could have been manic or over-the-top, but he kept things reserved, showing the quiet warping of personality associated with imposed isolation for years.The film isn't perfect.

657389,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B00005JPTK,R. Kyle,"[3, 5]","The story begins with one of humanity's greatest hopes seemingly fulfilled. Dr. Alice Krippen (Emma Thompson) has discovered the cure for cancer. This cure is a virus that is a subset of measles. Paraphrasing her words: the virus is a fast car.  Measles is like putting a criminal at the wheel.  What she did was ""replace that criminal with a cop.""At the time of the announcement, clinical trials had taken place with 10,900 subjects.  All were cancer-free.  Something clearly went very wrong between the clinical trials and the introduction of Krippen Virus (KV) into the population.At the time KV was introduced into the population, there were 6 billion people on earth. The virus killed 90% of those. The remaining 9% became rabid and photophobic, running in hives only at night and killing whatever they came in contact with.Dr. Robert Neville is one of the 1% of the population immune to KV--and survived. At onset, he was a US Army Colonel and virologist living in New York City.Even three years later, Neville hasn't given up.  He takes his motto from his hero, Bob Marley:""The people, who were trying to make this world worse... are not taking a day off. How can I? Light up the darkness.""By day, he and his faithful dog, Sam, travel the city looking for other survivors.  He daily broadcasts a message over all AM frequencies, asking anyone alive and uninfected to come to the South Street Seaport at mid-day offering to provide food, shelter and safety.By night, he hides in his heavily fortified home, preparing food and urging Sam to ""eat your vegetables."" He watches one movie per night, which he takes from a nearby video store--apparently viewing in alphabetical order.  He's now up to ""G"". In his basement, he's gathered a fully equipped medical laboratory and he's still working on a cure.  He still has hope, although his psyche is beginning to show cracks.Through flashbacks, we see Neville evacuating his wife and daughter from the city and the frantic efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.Probably the best aspect of this film is Will Smith. He does an impressive job of playing a physician keeping lone vigil over the city that was his charge--and holding on to his own waning hope and sanity. Sam the dog is the only character who can upstage him.I also loved the tributes to Bob Marley.  Like Anna (Alice Braga) in the film, so many of our current generation don't know the man's music or his story.  I'm glad to see both revisited in a popular format. And yes--I agree--Marley was one of the greatest musicians ever.What I found impossible to believe was the 'science.' Inconceivable that 10,900 people in the initial clinical trials showed no signs of the rabid KV virus?  Further, if the virus is also contagious to animals, wouldn't the rabidity, etc. have shown up in the animal testing which occurs prior to the human. I realize a good part of movie viewing is the 'suspension of disbelief' but I not only had to 'suspend,' I had to kick everything I know about the drug discovery process right out of my head. I honestly believe they could have come up with something far more plausible than this backstory.There are some warnings here:1.  While the movie ends with hope, you're going to be going through a lot of depressing material to get there.  Don't go if you're looking for a holiday escape 'pick me up film.'  This isn't it.2.  If you are intolerant of suspense, reconsider going.  My husband had to leave the theatre because he just couldn't handle parts of the film.3.  If scientific accuracy is your bag, you are going to hate this film for the reason I stated above (and more).4.  If you are a devotee of the original Richard Matheson book, you may well disapprove of the redux.All that being said, I still enjoyed much of the film.

I have not read the original book (but I plan to now that I've seen the film), so I really can't say how accurately the original story is portrayed. Regardless, I was RIVETED. I found the story to be very intriguing, suspenseful, sad, heart-warming, and downright nerve-wracking.What really held my attention, though, was Will Smith's performance. He has definitely come a long way since his ""Fresh Prince"" days. This man can carry a role like a champion (I also recommend his peformance in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" - it was Oscar-worthy). His performance took me in and made me sympathize with the character as if he were my best friend. >>>SPOILER ALERT&lt;&lt;&lt; When he ended up having to kill his beloved pet, I was almost in tears. You could feel Neville's anguish and pain beneath his determination to find a cure.Most of the detractors to this film seem to site the poor CGI effects that depicted the infected as being a major downfall of the movie. Yes, I've seen better, but this did not distract me or diminish my enjoyment of the film. From what I understand, the director originally had actors in make up and costumes to portray the infected, but it just didn't work and was not very convincing, so they decided to switch to CGI. Perhaps they were forced to do a ""rush job"" which resulted in subpar creature effects. Just my two cents' worth.As for the DVD itself, the picture and sound quality are both very good, but the extras that are offered really aren't all that much to rave about. There are a few ""animated comics"" that take place in other parts of the world that have to do with the virus infection, but are unrelated to Neville's story. These comics are well-done and stylish, but they aren't very long. There really could have been more special features offered. A ""making of"" short would have been nice, but instead, you can download a digital copy of the film. Big woop.This particular release also comes with an alternate ending not shown in theaters. In my personal opinion, the original theatrical ending was better. Again, just my two cents'.All in all, ""I Am Legend"" was an excellent film worthy of adding to your home video library.",4,Smith made this movie...,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,2522,"['Am', 'Legend', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'saw', 'theater', '2007', 'have', '2', 'kids', 'one', 'infant', 'hard', 'get', 'theater', 'days', 'usually', 'only', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'theater', 'am', 'VERY', 'interested', 'Other', 'wait', 'DVD', 'release.For', 'paying', 'see', 'theater', 'was', 'WELL', 'money', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'original', 'book', 'plan', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'accurately', 'original', 'story', 'portrayed', 'Regardless', 'was', 'RIVETED', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'very', 'intriguing', 'suspenseful', 'sad', 'heart-warming', 'downright', 'nerve-wracking.What', 'really', 'held', 'attention', 'was', 'Will', 'Smith', 'performance', 'definitely', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'days', 'man', 'can', 'carry', 'role', 'champion', 'also', 'recommend', 'peformance', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'was', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'took', 'made', 'sympathize', 'character', 'were', 'best', 'friend', '>', '>', '>', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'lt', 'lt', 'lt', 'When', 'ended', 'up', 'having', 'kill', 'beloved', 'pet', 'was', 'almost', 'tears', 'could', 'feel', 'Neville', 'anguish', 'pain', 'determination', 'find', 'cure.Most', 'detractors', 'film', 'seem', 'site', 'poor', 'CGI', 'effects', 'depicted', 'infected', 'being', 'major', 'downfall', 'movie', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'did', 'not', 'distract', 'diminish', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'what', 'understand', 'director', 'originally', 'had', 'actors', 'make', 'up', 'costumes', 'portray', 'infected', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'decided', 'switch', 'CGI', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'forced', 'do', 'rush', 'job', 'resulted', 'subpar', 'creature', 'effects', 'Just', 'two', 'cents', 'worth.As', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'extras', 'are', 'offered', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'that', 'much', 'rave', 'about', 'are', 'few', 'animated', 'comics', 'take', 'place', 'other', 'parts', 'world', 'have', 'do', 'virus', 'infection', 'are', 'unrelated', 'Neville', 'story', 'comics', 'are', 'well-done', 'stylish', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'long', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'offered', 'making', 'short', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'instead', 'can', 'download', 'digital', 'copy', 'film', 'Big', 'woop.This', 'particular', 'release', 'also', 'alternate', 'ending', 'not', 'shown', 'theaters', 'personal', 'opinion', 'original', 'theatrical', 'ending', 'was', 'better', 'Again', 'just', 'two', ""cents'.All"", 'Am', 'Legend', 'was', 'excellent', 'film', 'worthy', 'adding', 'home', 'video', 'library']",I Am Legend

657393,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JPTK,RMurray847,"[2, 5]","In just a couple of years, cancer will be cured via a mutated version of the measles virus...reprogrammed to destroy cancer. Yet just three years after that, mankind will be all but extinct, as the virus has mutated yet again to where it either kills the person carrying it or turns that person into a type of light-fearing zombie set on eating living flesh of any kind. In Manhattan, the lone ""normal"" survivor is Dr. Robert Neville, who coincidentally was the military scientist who was madly working on a cure as all of society crumbled around him. He continues to work on a cure...even when it seems there might not be any reason one is needed. Accompanied only by his faithful canine companion Sam, he roams the streets of NYC, hunting for deer, gathering supplies, renting DVDs and sending out an AM signal encouraging others to come to him. Oh, and occasionally ensnaring a zombie so that he can take it back to his lab to try his latest serum on it.That's the premise in a nutshell. You might be picking up on just a little cynicism in my description, because the movie invites it. It throws out a few tidbits about exactly what has happened to mankind and the virus (and also to many other species), yet the puzzle pieces we pick up don't quite make a full puzzle and sometimes the pieces don't seem to be to the same puzzle.Many, many movie have been made about the last remnants of mankind. A good recent example is the powerful CHILDREN OF MEN. We have a society that has apparently lost the ability to produce offspring. That's all we are told...no other details about how this has happened. It just has...and we see the consequences on society and on the very soul of mankind. If the movie had let little details trickle out...we would have tried to piece them together and no doubt we would have been left frustrated. Instead, we just have to accept it, and go where the movie takes us.I AM LEGEND throws out some tidbits and we try to assemble them into a cohesive narrative. But it can't be done. When the film was over, we spent our time trying to make sense of the little bits, instead of talking about the grand scheme of things...the movie itself.And there IS much to admire in the movie. Honestly, I have never seen CGI used more effectively to create a city. In Peter Jackson's KING KONG, he used CGI to recreate a Great Depression-era NYC. It was beautiful and convincing...but the abandoned Manhattan that we see in I AM LEGEND is even more seamless. You almost never can tell where a real set blends with a computer generated one. The city is empty, the bridges are destroyed, weeds grow everywhere and deer run everywhere. It's actually a pretty startling accomplishment, and seeing Will Smith driving all through these streets that should be jammed with people, traffic, lights, energy but instead are like a metropolitan dust bowl is pretty scary. And the effects are really convincing. Even the CG deer (and the lions who appear, no doubt having escaped from the Central Park Zoo) look amazingly convincing.And Will Smith gives a committed performance. He's not a great actor, but he is a charismatic presence...which in a film like this, where he's the ONLY person on screen for huge chunks of time, is even more important. We have to see the world almost entirely through his eyes, and Smith does an outstanding job in showing us the loneliness he feels all the time and the insanity that is lurking just around the corner. Smith is aided in his work by Sam, a wonderful German Shepherd. Sam is not one of these dogs who has been trained to cock his head to the side all the time and look like he understands every word being spoken. He's not ""cute."" He looks like a dog you or I could own...smart, but also still just a dog. He is loyal to a fault, but also inadvertently nearly gets his master killed in an amazingly tense scene in a dark warehouse where we first encounter the zombies. So I guess I'm saying Sam gives a naturalistic performance! Kudos to his trainers, and even to Smith, who works with Sam like a man who owns a DOG and not some unnaturally sensitive creature.There are some exciting scenes, no doubt. And as we would expect, the film has a huge final confrontation between Smith and a marauding horde of zombies. In many ways, it's a good scene...lots of noise, close calls, explosions and so forth. But sadly, where the CG that created NYC is nearly perfect, the filmmakers chose to make the zombies CG creations as well, and not for one moment do these creatures look physical. They are obvious CG creations...and that saps so much drama from the film. And I have to wonder WHY they did it? Certainly there are amazing things that can be done with makeup...and real people could have done a most of the things the zombies do. It was a serious blunder, in my opinion.I won't tell you any more of the plot, but suffice it to say that at the end, just a few too many ""oh, isn't that convenient"" moments pop up...and our willingness to suspend disbelief crumbles a bit. I would say that the first hour or so are really excellent, gripping, convincing and well-acted. The final 25 minutes or so are contrived and a bit awkward. It's like someone letting out the air from a very nice balloon.It's still a movie worth seeing. It's brisk enough to show you a good time...but when I left, my first thought was that the film could have been so much more. And then my mind turned to puzzling out all the inconsistencies in the back story. Don't let yourself be sucked in by those, and maybe you'll enjoy it more!!  3.5 stars.",4,Engaging & entertaining...yet enough holes to aggravate,1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,5569,"['just', 'couple',

657394,A1LE79HKL5G9C6,B00005JPTK,Rob6965,"[2, 4]","I Am Legend is effective as a thriller through the first three quarters of the film, but unfortunately it is unable to keep up the momentum through the ending, leaving most avid movie fans disappointed and unsatisfied. The film tells the story of Robert Neville, a military scientist who apparently is the only survivor of a terrible virus, first billed as the cure for cancer, which instead has either killed or mutated the human population of earth. Neville spends his days collecting food and searching for a cure with Sam his beloved dog, and his nights surviving the mutant onslaught.Will Smith holds the film together with his fantastic performance as Neville. He effectively portrays the mental breakdown of a man who has not seen another human in three years. Neville fights his mental demons just as much as the physical demons. Neville is consumed by his desire to ""fix"" the situation and find a cure, and Smith accurately depicts his panic in trying to do so, as well as his attempt to keep himself sane through setting up mannequins at his local movie store and talking to his dog.Coupled with Smith's performance is the breathtaking cinematography. The sweeping shots of a deserted NYC are stunning, as well as the panicked flashbacks into the evacuation process when the ""cure"" becomes deadly. Just watching the shots of New York's empty landmarks is enough to make I Am Legend worthwhile. Unfortunately, though, the CGI mutants leave something to be desired, and really aren't that terrifying. The monsters on the city streets look like the animation from Alvin and the Chipmunks (okay, maybe not that bad).Similarly, the script holds the film together nicely, providing scares as well as humor. However, the writers slackened off in the end, diverting from focusing on Neville's sanity, an approach which had worked so well up to that point, to focusing on simply the plot, with a poor Hollywood-cliche ending.Overall, though, Smith's performance and the stunning cinematography make I Am Legend worth a look, for all movie fans.",4,I Am Disappointing?,1198454400,"12 24, 2007",2007,2045,"['Am', 'Legend', 'effective', 'thriller', 'first', 'three', 'quarters', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'unable', 'keep', 'up', 'momentum', 'ending', 'leaving', 'most', 'avid', 'movie', 'fans', 'disappointed', 'unsatisfied', 'film', 'story', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'military', 'scientist', 'who', 'apparently', 'only', 'survivor', 'terrible', 'virus', 'first', 'billed', 'cure', 'cancer', 'instead', 'killed', 'mutated', 'human', 'population', 'earth', 'Neville', 'days', 'collecting', 'food', 'searching', 'cure', 'Sam', 'beloved', 'dog', 'nights', 'surviving', 'mutant', 'onslaught.Will', 'Smith', 'film', 'together', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Neville', 'effectively', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'human', 'three', 'years', 'Neville', 'fights', 'mental', 'demons', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'physical', 'demons', 'Neville', 'consumed', 'desire', 'fix', 'situation', 'find', 'cure', 'Smith', 'accurately', 'panic', 'trying', 'do', 'so', 'as', 'well', 'attempt', 'keep', 'sane', 'setting', 'up', 'mannequins', 'local', 'movie', 'store', 'talking', 'dog.Coupled', 'Smith', 'performance', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'deserted', 'NYC', 'are', 'stunning', 'as', 'well', 'panicked', 'flashbacks', 'evacuation', 'process', 'when', 'cure', 'deadly', 'Just', 'watching', 'shots', 'New', 'York', 'empty', 'landmarks', 'enough', 'make', 'Am', 'Legend', 'worthwhile', 'Unfortunately', 'CGI', 'mutants', 'leave', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'terrifying', 'monsters', 'city', 'streets', 'look', 'animation', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'okay', 'maybe', 'not', 'bad', '.Similarly', 'script', 'film', 'together', 'nicely', 'providing', 'scares', 'as', 'well', 'humor', 'However', 'writers', 'slackened', 'off', 'end', 'diverting', 'focusing', 'Neville', 'sanity', 'approach', 'had', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'point', 'focusing', 'simply', 'plot', 'poor', 'Hollywood-cliche', 'ending.Overall', 'though', 'Smith', 'performance', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'make', 'Am', 'Legend', 'look', 'movie', 'fans']",I Am Legend

657396,A3JPPR6JT75N0E,B00005JPTK,"Rob ""Coolerking""","[0, 0]","This is a good Will Smith movie, but as the latest adaptation of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, it disappoints. Some effort goes into the psychological aspect and survival strategy, but not deep enough to create the philosophical MacGyver that Robert Neville should be. Blame this partly on the casting. Smith is wrong for the role: he's not believable as a Colonel or a top scientist, or ultimately a father figure. Denzel Washington or even Nicolas Cage would have been far better Robert Nevilles. Another problem Will Smith brings is his fan base includes very young kids. As I sat in the theater, an entire group of third graders trouped in to watch the movie. They weren't actively disruptive, but they laughed at the wrong things. However, they bought tickets and made the Movie Moguls happy. Personally, I would find sitting through Shrek long enough to learn the lines, a hell worse than being eaten by the zombie-things, but I'm sure it delighted the young-uns. One aspect I may have shared with the kids was I thought, no holds barred, the dog is the best part of the movie. So much, that I would have given anything if when the other survivor-lady shows up and admires the picture of his daughter (with dog) and she comments on how pretty she is and who is she, couldn't Will have responded, ""oh that's Samantha!"" I mean, he's been bonding with the dog for years now.

was,but it's slow pace and erratic plot coupled with computer generated zombies that look TOO phony,all work against it.The story finds Smith as a doctor who lives a solitary existence in New York City,along with his German shepard,Sam.Through back story telling we find he had a wife and a daughter.He was one of a team that were responsible for developing a cancer cure.Much of the human population was inoculated,only for most to come down with a deadly virus that killed them.The others that weren't killed turned into light sensitive zombies,who came out at nightfall.Smith has been continuing to work on a cure in his basement lab,but with no success.His daily routine is monotonous,as his search pattern spreads out little by little each day through the city streets.He also makes his usual rounds to pick up necessities at various spots.One day comes which changes everything.His dog runs into a darkened building in which he has to enter to get him.With zombies inside waiting for the dark,he barely manages to escape with Sam alive.He captures one and takes it back to his lab for testing.The next day he discovers a dummy from a store he frequents,sitting down at the dead end of an entirely different street.It is a trap,and before he is able to respond he is suspended above the street by a trip wire.The sun is going down and he finally manages to get loose and fall to the ground,but accidentally impales himself on his knife.Before he can reach his car he and Sam are attacked by zombie dogs which bite Sam.Back at Smith's home and lab Smith injects Sam with a relaxant,but Sam soon turns.Smith is forced to kill his companion in his arms.Wanting revenge Smith deliberately heads out in the dark and confronts the zombies at a pier.He manages to take down a few,but he is soon overpowered.He is upside down and helpless in his car when a bright light illuminates the area.He is rescued by another survivor with a child.They return to Smith's place.The new survivor wants Smith to come with her to a place she has heard is not infected,but he remains adamant to stay and find a cure.Checking his captured zombie he finds he has finally found the cure,as the zombie's symptoms are slowly disappearing.That night the zombies come a calling right to Smith's house and they storm it.Smith and company are forced into a sealed glass area at one end of the basement,but the head zombie deliberately,and with a purpose Smith had heretofore denied,continually slams against the glass,trying to break it.Smith sends his two new friends out through an escape tunnel,while he stays to deal with what lies ahead.The zombies finally break the glass and just as they enter,Smith lets go with a grenade which completely destroys everything.The film ends as his two new companions finally make their way to the safe haven that was mentioned earlier.The vaccine Smith created was given to her and she hands it over to the heads of the population within the walled city.One point that bothers me about the film is that Smith never acknowledges or seems to realize at any time,that the zombies are actually more than air heads.He never cottons on to the fact that the zombies could think,let alone seek revenge as they started to do when they trapped him by enticing him with a dummy he encounters everyday.He never asks who moved it or why.It never seems to occur to him the reason the zombie behaviour changed so drastically was because of his capture of the mate to the leader of a group of them.For a supposedly smart guy,he was pretty dumb.That said,Smith does have some good acting moments,especially his killing of his beloved Sam.It just wasn't enough however to elevate this film to anything than average,at best.The CGI zombies just look too phony.I think the film makers spent most of their budget on their star and had to resort to CGI instead of prosthetic make up.The whole feel of the film would have been far superior had the zombies been real people,ala Resident Evil.Emma Thompson has an all too brief cameo as a doctor being interviewed on a TV screen at the beginning.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Since the film is descended from the comics,there are four animated comics included with the DVD.All in all the film is a slow moving one,with CGI zombies that look so phony,one cannot suspend their disbelief for any more than two seconds.Smith tries his best,but what should have been a home run,turned into a walk to first base.",3,A tepid futuristic film,1375488000,"08 3,

657399,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B00005JPTK,Robert J. Crawford,"[0, 0]","This film starts out with great promise, with WS as a lone man in a world of chaos.  He is hunting, through the streets of Manhattan, for food and uninfected humans, all the while working on a vaccine for the bio-engineered virus that has more of less destroyed humanity.  WS is convincing as an anguished, intelligent man, who is struggling with his isolation, though his dog is a vital companion.  With flashbacks and preserved video cuts, past history becomes clear:  WS was an army scientist who is the only person to understand the vaccine, which is what makes him immune to the disease of the savages who come out at night.  He has lost his family, understands what has happened to the world and what needs to be done, and has a charismatic strength of character.So far so good.  You see WS suffer and think as well as act with the decisiveness you would expect from a hero.  There are many excellent details, such as the relationship with his dog or his golfing off the wing of a grounded jet fighter.  It is vivid and beautiful, completely believable.However, once the night bad guys come to the fore, the film begins to falter.  First, the night baddies are simply not well executed technically:  they don't look real, so you can't believe in them; as one reviewer noted, they look too much like video game characters.  We expect better in computer animation, I'm sorry.  Second, from an introspective survivor film, you get grotesquely violent action.  Not only is the plot unrealistic - the baddies have not discovered him until the night he is rescued by an immune woman and then they come in force - but the action is kind of ridiculous:  the baddies seem invulnerable, though they have lost their human intelligence as they transformed into hairless half-dogs and behave as if they have rabies.  They are seeking human flesh and seem to have some kind of hive mind, like an insect society, but none of the promising threads are developed into plot and theme.  There is not even enough to enable the thoughtful viewer to connect the dots, which is another indispensable component to great scifi.That being said, I am quite a sucker for these end-of-humanity films.  This one got me to believe, at least for the first half.  It is a mistake to have made it into an action film in the end, though WS is a good action hero.  WS' role is more dramatic than his usual roles, more complex as a character and not at all happygolucky as we expect of the fresh prince.  He is a good actor and did well here, but the script and direction  take it over the top.Recommended, but not with much enthusiasm.",3,"good, but degenerates from a nightmare of loneliness into a botched action film",1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,2605,"['film', 'out', 'great', 'promise', 'WS', 'lone', 'man', 'world', 'chaos', 'hunting', 'streets', 'Manhattan', 'food', 'uninfected', 'humans', 'while', 'working', 'vaccine', 'bio-engineered', 'virus', 'more', 'less', 'destroyed', 'humanity', 'WS', 'convincing', 'anguished', 'intelligent', 'man', 'who', 'struggling', 'isolation', 'dog', 'vital', 'companion', 'flashbacks', 'preserved', 'video', 'cuts', 'past', 'history', 'becomes', 'clear', 'WS', 'was', 'army', 'scientist', 'who', 'only', 'person', 'understand', 'vaccine', 'what', 'immune', 'disease', 'savages', 'who', 'come', 'out', 'night', 'lost', 'family', 'what', 'happened', 'world', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'charismatic', 'strength', 'character.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'see', 'WS', 'suffer', 'think', 'as', 'well', 'act', 'decisiveness', 'would', 'expect', 'hero', 'are', 'many', 'excellent', 'details', 'such', 'relationship', 'dog', 'golfing', 'off', 'wing', 'grounded', 'jet', 'fighter', 'vivid', 'beautiful', 'completely', 'believable.However', 'once', 'night', 'bad', 'guys', 'come', 'fore', 'film', 'falter', 'First', 'night', 'baddies', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'well', 'executed', 'technically', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'real', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'one', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'look', 'too', 'much', 'video', 'game', 'characters', 'expect', 'better', 'computer', 'animation', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Second', 'introspective', 'survivor', 'film', 'get', 'grotesquely', 'violent', 'action', 'Not', 'only', 'plot', 'unrealistic', 'baddies', 'have', 'not', 'discovered', 'night', 'rescued', 'immune', 'woman', 'then', 'come', 'force', 'action', 'kind', 'ridiculous', 'baddies', 'seem', 'invulnerable', 'have', 'lost', 'human', 'intelligence', 'transformed', 'hairless', 'half-dogs', 'behave', 'have', 'rabies', 'are', 'seeking', 'human', 'flesh', 'seem', 'have', 'kind', 'hive', 'mind', 'insect', 'society', 'none', 'promising', 'threads', 'are', 'developed', 'plot', 'theme', 'not', 'even', 'enough', 'enable', 'thoughtful', 'viewer', 'connect', 'dots', 'indispensable', 'component', 'great', 'scifi.That', 'being', 'said', 'am', 'quite', 'sucker', 'end-of-humanity', 'films', 'one', 'got', 'believe', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'mistake', 'have', 'made', 'action', 'film', 'end', 'WS', 'good', 'action', 'hero', 'WS', 'role', 'more', 'dramatic', 'usual', 'roles', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'not', 'happygolucky', 'expect', 'fresh', 'prince', 'good', 'actor', 'did', 'well', 'here', 'script', 'direction', 'take', 'top.Recommended', 'not', 'much', 'enthusiasm']",I Am Legend

It's not a story that fits with popular film canons, it REALLY isn't. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone, but suffice it to say, the novelty of the ending works great on the page, but would probably have people storming the box office to get their money back as a film.But every so often, seemingly about every 20 years, it gets made into a movie, anyway.So what can you take from the book that WORKS?  The desolation of a lone survivor in a great empty city.. the eerie beauty of that kindof place and what that life would be.For this viewer this film nailed it.  No, it's not a slugfest, an action-packed thrillride.. No, Will Smith is not chewing a cigar and firing off one-liners to no-one for 2 hours (thank goodness- one can only imagine how this film would have played like with Arnold Schwarzeneggar, the original choice for the lead).So, what it IS is a stoic, QUIET observation of one person and a dog against a vividly empty Manhattan.  I say vividly because the CGI erasure of people used in this film is one the nicest understated effects I've seen used in a sci-fi film in many a year.The vampires of the original story have been given a reasonable (if predictable) update, and CGI is used extensively to give them a jumpy, feral quality.  If CGI makes them less believable, it at least succeeds in making them very unhuman, and the de-evolution aspect of these creatures makes this vision more isolating (and genuinely sad) than perhaps it should be.Will Smith knocked me out in this film.  It's nothing more than a meditation on remaining hopeful and holding together, and he evokes a big range of emotion with hardly a word.  No higher praise.As a sci-fi enthusiast, I'd give it 5 stars, but there's no way to resolve the ending of this story.  The original ending is an ironic slap in the face to the reader, the Omega Man nails Heston/Jesus to a cross, and this film tries to find a hopeful middle ground, but it just doesn't satisfy... to their credit they had an alternate ending that gives the story a stronger humanist slant, and it's interesting, but even less satisfying than the one they chose to use.**EDIT** (I take my last comment back------I have since seen the blu-ray release with the alternate ending intact and feel it's a much better film, a better character study, and a better resolution.. though it raises more questions about Neville's motives for finding a cure that fall outside of the simple hero story)So, yes, it flops in the last 3 minutes, but it's the journey thru that stark beautiful city that you hope we don't live to see that makes it worth it.",4,"Traditional, Stoic, A Great Performance",1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,2672,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Am', 'Legend', 'many', 'years', 'not', 'story', 'popular', 'film', 'canons', 'REALLY', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'book', 'anyone', 'say', 'novelty', 'ending', 'great', 'page', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'people', 'storming', 'box', 'office', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'film.But', 'so', 'often', 'seemingly', '20', 'years', 'made', 'movie', 'anyway.So', 'what', 'can', 'take', 'book', 'WORKS', 'desolation', 'lone', 'survivor', 'great', 'empty', 'city..', 'eerie', 'beauty', 'kindof', 'place', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be.For', 'viewer', 'film', 'nailed', 'No', 'not', 'slugfest', 'action-packed', 'thrillride..', 'No', 'Will', 'Smith', 'not', 'chewing', 'cigar', 'firing', 'off', 'one-liners', 'no-one', '2', 'hours', 'thank', 'goodness-', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzeneggar', 'original', 'choice', 'lead', '.So', 'what', 'stoic', 'QUIET', 'observation', 'one', 'person', 'dog', 'vividly', 'empty', 'Manhattan', 'say', 'vividly', 'CGI', 'erasure', 'people', 'used', 'film', 'one', 'nicest', 'understated', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'used', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'many', 'year.The', 'vampires', 'original', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'reasonable', 'predictable', 'update', 'CGI', 'used', 'extensively', 'give', 'jumpy', 'feral', 'quality', 'CGI', 'less', 'believable', 'least', 'making', 'very', 'unhuman', 'de-evolution', 'aspect', 'creatures', 'vision', 'more', 'isolating', 'genuinely', 'sad', 'perhaps', 'should', 'be.Will', 'Smith', 'knocked', 'out', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'meditation', 'remaining', 'hopeful', 'holding', 'together', 'big', 'range', 'emotion', 'hardly', 'word', 'higher', 'praise.As', 'sci-fi', 'enthusiast', ""'d"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'way', 'resolve', 'ending', 'story', 'original', 'ending', 'ironic', 'slap', 'face', 'reader', 'Omega', 'Man', 'Heston/Jesus', 'cross', 'film', 'find', 'hopeful', 'middle', 'ground', 'just', ""n't"", 'satisfy', 'credit', 'had', 'alternate', 'ending', 'story', 'stronger', 'humanist', 'slant', 'interesting', 'even', 'less', 'satisfying', 'one', 'chose', 'use', '**EDIT**', 'take', 'last', 'comment', 'back', 'have', 'seen', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'alternate', 'ending', 'intact', 'feel', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'better', 'character', 'study', 'better', 'resolution..', 'more', 'questions', 'Neville', 'motives', 'finding', 'cure', 'fall', 'simple', 'hero', 'story', 'So', 'yes', 'last', '3', 'minutes', 'journey', 'thru', 'stark', 'beautiful', 'city', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'see']",I Am Legend

Through some bizarre fluke, he's one of only a handful of people with a natural immunity to a virus that, in less than three years time, has denuded the world of most of its human population.  Now, Neville, a renowned virologist himself, spends his days cruising the streets of a deserted Manhattan, and his nights hiding out from the infected cannibalistic mutants who venture forth only after dark (shades of ""The Time Machine,"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" and dozens of other similar films).""I Am Legend"" is just the latest film version of the 1954 Richard Matheson novel that also served as the basis for 1971's ""The Omega Man,"" with Charlton Heston in the lead role.  Despite its occasional feeling of over-familiarity, ""I Am Legend,"" is a generally more subtle and thoughtful work than the average sci-fi film, one that, in addition to its more conventional action sequences and flesh-eating monsters, explores themes like survivors' guilt and the effect of prolonged isolation on the human psyche.  The movie, however, is clearly most notable for its remarkably convincing vision of a desolate, post-apocalyptic New York City, where weeds grow promiscuously through holes in the pavement and uninhabited buildings and idle cars serve as ghostly reminders of a civilization now gone from the scene (though one questions whether the place would really look quite this shoddy a mere three years after its abandonment).  Kudos to director Francis Lawrence and his crack team of visual and special effects artists for so successfully bringing this concept to life on screen.  For the most part, the thrills are nicely balanced with moments of tender sentiment, as Neville reflects back on the time he had with his late wife and daughter.In a role reminiscent of Tom Hanks' in ""Cast Away,"" Will Smith, largely bereft of any human companionship, spends most of the movie talking either to himself or to Sam, his loyal German Shepherd.  In this setup, Smith once again demonstrates that he is definitely a commanding presence on screen, keeping us interested even in those moments when not much is actually happening in the story.  For, there is, admittedly, a trifle more downtime in the movie than many of the more hardcore action fans would probably like.  That objection aside, however, ""I Am Legend"" provides enough food for thought and a sufficient number of jump-out-of-your-seat thrills to make it worth watching.",3,a bit conventional but with unforgettable visuals,1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,2489,"['***1/2Robert', 'Neville', 'almost', 'literally', 'last', 'man', 'left', 'Earth', 'bizarre', 'fluke', 'one', 'only', 'handful', 'people', 'natural', 'immunity', 'virus', 'less', 'three', 'years', 'time', 'denuded', 'world', 'most', 'human', 'population', 'Now', 'Neville', 'renowned', 'virologist', 'days', 'cruising', 'streets', 'deserted', 'Manhattan', 'nights', 'hiding', 'out', 'infected', 'cannibalistic', 'mutants', 'who', 'venture', 'only', 'dark', 'shades', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'dozens', 'other', 'similar', 'films', 'Am', 'Legend', 'just', 'latest', 'film', 'version', '1954', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'also', 'served', 'basis', '1971', 'Omega', 'Man', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'lead', 'role', 'occasional', 'feeling', 'over-familiarity', 'Am', 'Legend', 'generally', 'more', 'subtle', 'thoughtful', 'work', 'average', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'one', 'addition', 'more', 'conventional', 'action', 'sequences', 'flesh-eating', 'monsters', 'themes', 'survivors', 'guilt', 'effect', 'prolonged', 'isolation', 'human', 'psyche', 'movie', 'however', 'clearly', 'most', 'notable', 'remarkably', 'convincing', 'vision', 'desolate', 'post-apocalyptic', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'weeds', 'grow', 'promiscuously', 'holes', 'pavement', 'uninhabited', 'buildings', 'idle', 'cars', 'serve', 'ghostly', 'reminders', 'civilization', 'now', 'gone', 'scene', 'one', 'questions', 'place', 'would', 'really', 'look', 'quite', 'mere', 'three', 'years', 'abandonment', 'Kudos', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'crack', 'team', 'visual', 'special', 'effects', 'artists', 'so', 'successfully', 'bringing', 'concept', 'life', 'screen', 'most', 'part', 'thrills', 'are', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'moments', 'tender', 'sentiment', 'Neville', 'back', 'time', 'had', 'late', 'wife', 'daughter.In', 'role', 'reminiscent', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Cast', 'Away', 'Will', 'Smith', 'largely', 'bereft', 'human', 'companionship', 'most', 'movie', 'talking', 'Sam', 'loyal', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'setup', 'Smith', 'once', 'again', 'definitely', 'commanding', 'presence', 'screen', 'keeping', 'interested', 'even', 'moments', 'when', 'not', 'much', 'actually', 'happening', 'story', 'admittedly', 'trifle', 'more', 'downtime', 'movie', 'many', 'more', 'hardcore', 'action', 'fans', 'would', 'probably', 'like', 'objection', 'aside', 'however', 'Am', 'Legend', 'enough', 'food', 'thought', 'sufficient', 'number', 'jump-out-of-your-seat', 'thrills', 'make', 'worth', 'watching']",I Am Legend

Where are the bodies and/or skeletons?  If the surviors have resorted to cannabalism why are they only preying on the sole survior? Shouldn't some be starving? If they are eating abandoned food why are they attacking the one survivor?  If they are irrational and preying on humans why are they not attacking each other?  Where is the electricty coming from?  The first time he enters his safe house he hides his tracks but doesn't do that at any other time yet that is how he is tracked down.  Who set the trap for him?  That was left open -- why were cars used as counter weights when it would be easier to use something more easily handled?  Why was he constantly driving at high speeds?  Shooting a deer would have been easy yet he chose to chase them in his car -- why not run one down?

657408,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,B00005JPTK,R. Sardrena,"[0, 0]","Based on Richard Matheson's excellent 1960 novel of the same name, ""I Am Legend"" is a welcome, but disappointing adaptation.  Much commentary has been made about the protagonist's nemeses - the ghoulish nocturnal zombies - and their lack of believability. That impression is caused both by unfortunate choices in casting and in pop-cultural references. Star Will Smith recently appeared in a weak adaptation of Asimov's classic ""I Robot"" in which CGI robots dominated the screen.  Smith's presence reminds the viewer of the similarity of those robots to the latter film's zombies. He also starred in ""Men In Black,"" a film which opened with a CGI alien howling, shaking his head in the same manner as the zombies. There are prominent scenes in ""Legend"" in which the characters watch the animated film ""Shrek,"" another landmark effort in CGI. Inevitably, the viewer's mind is drawn to parallels between the peculiarities of the zombies' movements and those of the earlier films.All of that aside, is ""Legend"" any good? It's mildly diverting, but any adaptation of Matheson's book must capture the terrible stillness of the soul that the last man on Earth must feel.  This film is too busy to elicit that mood, despite its attempts at pathos. There are two endings for this film: the alternate ending is more thoughtful, and is foreshadowed early in the film; I would therefore recommend the two-disc version.",3,"Cross-references hurt ""Legend""",1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,1407,"['Based', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'excellent', '1960', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Am', 'Legend', 'welcome', 'disappointing', 'adaptation', 'Much', 'commentary', 'been', 'made', 'protagonist', 'nemeses', 'ghoulish', 'nocturnal', 'zombies', 'lack', 'believability', 'impression', 'caused', 'unfortunate', 'choices', 'casting', 'pop-cultural', 'references', 'Star', 'Will', 'Smith', 'recently', 'appeared', 'weak', 'adaptation', 'Asimov', 'classic', 'Robot', 'CGI', 'robots', 'dominated', 'screen', 'Smith', 'presence', 'viewer', 'similarity', 'robots', 'latter', 'film', 'zombies', 'also', 'starred', 'Men', 'Black', 'film', 'opened', 'CGI', 'alien', 'howling', 'shaking', 'head', 'same', 'manner', 'zombies', 'are', 'prominent', 'scenes', 'Legend', 'characters', 'watch', 'animated', 'film', 'Shrek', 'landmark', 'effort', 'CGI', 'Inevitably', 'viewer', 'mind', 'drawn', 'parallels', 'peculiarities', 'zombies', 'movements', 'earlier', 'films.All', 'aside', 'Legend', 'good', 'mildly', 'diverting', 'adaptation', 'Matheson', 'book', 'must', 'capture', 'terrible', 'stillness', 'soul', 'last', 'man', 'Earth', 'must', 'feel', 'film', 'too', 'busy', 'elicit', 'mood', 'attempts', 'pathos', 'are', 'two', 'endings', 'film', 'alternate', 'ending', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'foreshadowed', 'early', 'film', 'would', 'therefore', 'recommend', 'two-disc', 'version']",I Am Legend

In other words, some novels are very hard to re-create into motion pictures because their story lines are so unworldly and so creative that cinema may ruin our mental images of what it should be.  However, despite movies almost never living up to the book, Richard Matheson must be proud of this rendition.  Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a scientist living in New York as a survivor of a deadly virus that killed off most of the world and made vampires of the rest of them.  By day, he hunts the streets of the city, which has been overtaken by wild animals and he searches stores and homes with his dog, Sam, for any food and entertainment to move him along through the day.  By night, his house is protected with any and every means of security you can think of in order to keep away the vampires that lurk in the shadows.Ultimately, Neville's goal is to find the cure for this deadly disease in order to save the human race.As many of the previous reviewers have stated, the first half of the film gives the impression that this could be one of the all-time greats.  The phenomenal re-creation of New York City was more than enough to capture the viewer's attention and fill their blood with intrigue.  It's the type of experience in the movies where each time you watch the scenes in Times Square, you notice something different.  For instance, the gas prices (God help us) are over $6 a gallon, or the billboard of the long awaited Superman vs. Batman film that never got off the ground.The latter half of the film demonstrates how predictably clich&eacute; hero stories have become in cinema.  However, I can only praise the work Will Smith does in this movie.  His acting was so good that I left the theater convinced that he is in a league of his own among Hollywood talent.  His emotions are so believable that it literally saves what may be portrayed as completely ridiculous scenes in the movie.  As some of the reviews stated, there were episodes where Smith's loneliness and frustration was overtaking him with such force that you could feel tears burning in the back of your eyes.  His acting was absolutely sensational, to say the least.This movie was the story of one man, and there is no man that could do it like Will Smith.  I couldn't think of another actor that can stand alone and excel the way Will did in this movie.It saves very mediocre directing and a somewhat slumping plot line as the film evolves.  However, this IS a five star film.  It's a well played out drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the use of silence only adds to the heart-stopping suspense.  I'd recommend it to anyone interested in action or drama, and it's a must for any fan of Will Smith.Grade: A-",5,"Will Smith, and nothing more...",1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,2837,"['When', 'novel', 'written', 'reader', 'free', 'explore', 'creative', 'side', 'picturing', 'unraveling', 'plot', 'heads', 'other', 'words', 'novels', 'are', 'very', 'hard', 're-create', 'motion', 'pictures', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'so', 'unworldly', 'so', 'creative', 'cinema', 'may', 'ruin', 'mental', 'images', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'However', 'movies', 'almost', 'never', 'living', 'up', 'book', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'must', 'be', 'proud', 'rendition', 'Will', 'Smith', 'plays', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'scientist', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'survivor', 'deadly', 'virus', 'killed', 'off', 'most', 'world', 'made', 'vampires', 'rest', 'day', 'streets', 'city', 'been', 'overtaken', 'wild', 'animals', 'stores', 'homes', 'dog', 'Sam', 'food', 'entertainment', 'move', 'along', 'day', 'night', 'house', 'protected', 'means', 'security', 'can', 'think', 'order', 'keep', 'away', 'vampires', 'lurk', 'shadows.Ultimately', 'Neville', 'goal', 'find', 'cure', 'deadly', 'disease', 'order', 'save', 'human', 'race.As', 'many', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'impression', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'all-time', 'greats', 'phenomenal', 're-creation', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', 'more', 'enough', 'capture', 'viewer', 'attention', 'fill', 'blood', 'intrigue', 'type', 'experience', 'movies', 'where', 'time', 'watch', 'scenes', 'Times', 'Square', 'notice', 'something', 'different', 'instance', 'gas', 'prices', 'God', 'help', 'are', '6', 'gallon', 'billboard', 'long', 'awaited', 'Superman', 'vs.', 'Batman', 'film', 'never', 'got', 'ground.The', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'how', 'predictably', 'clich', 'eacute', 'hero', 'stories', 'have', 'become', 'cinema', 'However', 'can', 'only', 'praise', 'work', 'Will', 'Smith', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'left', 'theater', 'convinced', 'league', 'own', 'Hollywood', 'talent', 'emotions', 'are', 'so', 'believable', 'literally', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'portrayed', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'movie', 'reviews', 'stated', 'were', 'episodes', 'where', 'Smith', 'loneliness', 'frustration', 'was', 'overtaking', 'such', 'force', 'could', 'feel', 'tears', 'burning', 'back', 'eyes', 'acting', 'was', 'absolutely', 'sensational', 'say', 'least.This', 'movie', 'was', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'man', 'could', 'do', 'like', 'Will', 'Smith', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'actor', 'can', 'stand', 'alone', 'excel', 'way', 'Will', 'did', 'movie.It', 'very', 'mediocre', 'directing', 'somewhat', 'slumping', 'plot', 'line', 'film', 'evolves', 'However', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'drama', 'edge', 'seat', 'use', 'silence', 'only', 'heart-stopping', 'suspense', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'action', 'drama', 'must', 'fan', 'Will', 'Smith.Grade', 'A-']",I Am Legend

Will Smith eventually finds the cure, and humanity is saved! The end.The best part was the story about Bob Marley. I didn't know Marley appeared for his concert two days after he was shot. I never knew that. I ended up downloading all of Marley's songs from iTunes.For visual effects (or special effects if you prefer) I give it 5 stars. The images of New York after the extinction of man are spectacular. But amazing visual effects alone do not make a movie. The storyline is a bit too simplistic, and it seemed like the director was in a hurry to end it. There are no twists to the story; no moments of thrill and intrigue. The movie is actually predictable.One thing I can say is that I was amazed by the muscular body of Will Smith.

657415,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JPTK,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 0]","Give director Francis Lawrence this much credit for his work in ""I Am Legend:"" He knew how to stick a sword in its belly. The movie is all kinds of ridiculous - in part because it holds its cards practically *inside* the vest for the opening act - and Lawrence, instead of succumbing to hubris and letting it drag on for a craptacular two-and-a-half hours (like most blockbusters these days) he ends it, mercifully, at 90 minutes. Yeah, maybe it's because the zombies look like Bat Boy from the Weekly World News, but still - brevity is a virtue.Stripped of all the subplots that made Richard Matheson's source novel so compelling (and the inspiration for some good films, comics, and books since its printing in the 1950s), ""I Am Legend"" is a vaguely intriguing ""Cast Away"" vehicle for Will Smith until it must deliver some action goods, which is does efficiently and without any particular rules or sense whatsoever, before closing on a old fashioned Blow Up Real Good sequence. This explosion, really, is the perfect ending for the film Lawrence actually made. Some moviegoers - who have invested far too much thought in this lame experience - prefer the ""alternate ending."" Not I, for reasons that simply don't matter.Smith is Dr. Robert Neville, the last ""survivor"" in New York City of a cancer vaccine gone viral. Most New Yorkers died upon contracting the illness; others mutated into rubber-faced, physically amazing zombies that hate the sunlight, even though, unlike the spiritually touched vampire, they're simply mutations, which means they'd need sunlight to...oh, never mind. If you want to believe the sun could crash into a black hole and these creatures could survive, go ahead. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman provides all of this with a somber sincerity that informs the movie's look and tone in the first half-hour; Neville and his German shepherd stalk the streets of an overgrown NYC in near silence, as Lawrence keeps the soundtrack music to a minimum. Like ""Cast Away,"" it's compelling to hear the sounds of the world in this film. Unlike ""Cast Away,"" it also seems like a way to blow 30 minutes without having to show those ridiculous zombies.So Neville's still after a cure for the mutation, and he carefully orchestrates traps so he can capture ""subjects"" for tests; despite the end of civilization, all of the utilities still work and the gas pumps aren't dry, so Neville uses a giant, state-of-the-art lab for his work. The zombies seem to be getting smarter, though, plotting their own revenge on the ""hunter."" Sandwiched in there are some flashbacks of NYC's last night as a living (and implausibly civilized) city and the fate of Neville's wife and daughter. These are effective enough, but they're also cheat, really - the movie doesn't want to give Neville the same struggle he has in the novel.It's right about then that Lawrence gets his hustle on; Goldsman shuttles a couple more survivors onscreen so the title can make the least bit of sense, but Neville doesn't want much to do with them. There's a raid, a showdown, and a big boom. Or, if you prefer, the alternate love-in. Blammo.

I'm not sure if it was because the movie did such a good job with its theme or just because it was depressing.Some elements were excellent.  Will Smith had a heavy load to carry in this movie and he is great in it.  His loneliness is palpable -- talking to mannequins he set up in the video store where he checks out the movies in alphabetical order and listening to old recorded newscasts.  The scene where he flips out because one of his ""friends"" has been moved shows how close to the edge his loneliness has brought him.I also loved the CGI New York landscape.  It seemed very realistic.  And finally, the animated short stories included in the DVD were quite interesting.I wasn't as fond of some other elements.  The ""monsters"" looked too much like Gollum and too much uniformly alike; they would have been better done with actors and more individual makeup.  Also, it was not clear whether they were devolved to a purely animal level or if they still retained intelligence.  That made the scene with the moved mannequin and the rope trap a little confusing.  Did they set the trap or was Neville so on edge that he forgot one of his own traps?  It was also not clear what the infected ate with only Neville left as potential prey.  And if animals could be infected, why was Neville hunting deer that didn't act infected?As great a job as Will Smith did playing his part, the amount of time with just one actor and a dog on screen was too long and the flashback scenes didn't provide enough explanation of how it was that Neville became the last surviving person on Manhattan, much less how the virus killed off most of the world.And finally, a caution for people who still have older analog TVs:  this movie is visually dark and that resulted in many scenes that were just black screens with the music track in the background.

He broadcasts daily on AM radio asking for people to meet up with him at what looks to be an old naval base by the water.  Neville and his German Shepherd Sam show up everyday looking for other survivors of the virus, named KV.  Once thought to be the cure for cancer, the engineered virus mutated and spread airborne, killing people and radically altering those who didn't die into zombie-like, mindless beings.Neville spends his days hunting deer, loose from the park or the zoo, and picking up supplies for his house.  His nights are spent inside his altered house, shuttered and barricaded against the beasts of the night.  Beneath the house is his lab, where he continues to work diligently on a cure for those infected monsters that prowl the streets at night, hungry for blood.  He sets traps to catch the zombies for test subjects using his serums.  At last, Neville believes he's found a serum that will work.During an excursion in town, Neville notices one of his store mannequins has been moved, and when he investigates he's caught in a trap and unconscious until nightfall.  Who moved the mannequin and who set the trap?  Is someone else still alive and uninfected?  Neville and Sam must make it back to the car before sundown, but the hour is late and the darkness is falling.  Something bad is about to happen.To those of you who've read the classic 1954 novella, 'I Am Legend', by Richard Matheson, the movie does not follow the book very well.  Other movies have been made from the novella, including the 1964 movie 'The Last Man On Earth' and 'The Omega Man' filmed in 1971 starring Charlton Heston. In this version, the infected are more like zombies than vampires, and more aggressive.  The film had been modernized (the incidents in the book take place in 1976) which is more attractive to today's audiences, and there's a lot more action involved.  The movie is more external (action) which is well suited for a film version than the book, which is more internal (introspective), but what I really didn't like was how they twisted the ideal of Neville's ""legend"" status.Will Smith does an excellent performance as Neville, and the atmosphere of a deserted New York City was captured quite nicely.  The zombies are pretty cool, though I don't know who dreamed up the hairless idea.  Sam the dog is added to the film (not in the book) but Sam stole the show for me.  (I love German Shepherds!)

Nelson ""scotty :-)""","[1, 1]","Unlike most of the other reviews, I have not seen any of the other incarnations of the novel, nor have I read the actual novel. I saw the preview for this movie and it piqued my interest.  I saw the movie first in the theater and, like most people, was blown away by Will Smith's performance.  (I know that horror movies are rarely in contention for Oscar's, but I feel Will's performance was Oscar worthy.)  The movie itself was very good, although in the theatrical version, i wasn't totally clear on the reason for 'Fred' being moved, and from that point on, the theatrical version for me was not as great as it could have been.  Maybe my imagination failed me that day in the theater.Then i purchased the two-disc version.  i was BLOWN AWAY by the 'alternative' version.  Keeping in mind I have not read the novel or seen the other versions, the 'alternative version' on this DVD package was the story I was hoping to see.  This time, with clearer understanding of the events that happen after (and around) the 'Fred' incident, the movie did not let go.  This again shows that studio execs. do NOT understand the movie going audience.  I do not see this ending as 'controversial', but rather hopeful.  The Alpha Male's actions lend hope to the society of vampires/Zombies...maybe not in the 'cheesy all's well that ends well' kind of ending hollywood is known for, but in a 'this is the way life has progressed, lets make the best of it' kind of way.  Yes, this movie does borrow from stories like  28 days later, but (like 28 days) has the desire to show that life is not a hollywood 'romanticized' ending, but a real world where life happens and humanity must learn to adapt.As far as the CGI effects for the vampires/zombies, I feel they enhanced (both) versions of the story.

I had no idea what it was about before I rented it and just got it because Will Smith was in the movie.About the movie: Scientific testing supposedly cured 10,009 people of cancer. However, something in that medicine had a negative affect on these people afterwards. People started acting more like animals, killing and abusing each other for prey. Only a select few were immune to bites from this savage group and from getting the disease that swept the world. In comes Dr. Robert Neville (Will Smith) who is immune to the disease but still fears for his life and that of his gorgeous German Shepherd, who is his best friend and only confidant that is alive. Both he and his dog prowl the area for surviving human beings.Pros: I love dogs like most humans love babies so I spent quite a bit of the time grinning and going ""Aw"" when the German Shepherd did cute things like not eating its vegetables or licking Smith's face. As a puppy, you could've put that dog on a postcard and framed it to your wall. The movie is definitely unique and took some great risks and a very unromantic twist about ""the last man on Earth."" With such a serious film, there were definitely some uncomfortable comedic scenes, like Dr. Neville being so lonely for comfort that he has now decided to holla at female mannequins. The special effects could make the average horror film phobic jump at every scene, and I enjoyed them.Cons: I never figured out what the purpose of the lion and deer was supposed to be, especially considering you never saw another lion in the movie again so it wasn't like the city completely turned into a jungle.",5,A boat load of strange,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,1681,"['movie', 'quite', 'possibly', 'strangest', 'one', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'rented', 'just', 'got', 'Will', 'Smith', 'was', 'movie.About', 'movie', 'Scientific', 'testing', 'supposedly', 'cured', '10,009', 'people', 'cancer', 'However', 'something', 'medicine', 'had', 'negative', 'affect', 'people', 'afterwards', 'People', 'started', 'acting', 'more', 'animals', 'killing', 'abusing', 'other', 'prey', 'Only', 'select', 'few', 'were', 'immune', 'bites', 'savage', 'group', 'getting', 'disease', 'swept', 'world', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'immune', 'disease', 'still', 'fears', 'life', 'gorgeous', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'who', 'best', 'friend', 'only', 'confidant', 'alive', 'dog', 'area', 'surviving', 'human', 'beings.Pros', 'love', 'dogs', 'most', 'humans', 'love', 'babies', 'so', 'spent', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'grinning', 'going', 'Aw', 'when', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'did', 'cute', 'things', 'not', 'eating', 'vegetables', 'licking', 'Smith', 'face', 'puppy', 'could', ""'ve"", 'put', 'dog', 'postcard', 'framed', 'wall', 'movie', 'definitely', 'unique', 'took', 'great', 'risks', 'very', 'unromantic', 'twist', 'last', 'man', 'Earth', 'serious', 'film', 'were', 'definitely', 'uncomfortable', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'Dr.', 'Neville', 'being', 'so', 'lonely', 'comfort', 'now', 'decided', 'holla', 'female', 'mannequins', 'special', 'effects', 'could', 'make', 'average', 'horror', 'film', 'phobic', 'jump', 'scene', 'enjoyed', 'them.Cons', 'never', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'purpose', 'lion', 'deer', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'especially', 'considering', 'never', 'saw', 'lion', 'movie', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'city', 'completely', 'turned', 'jungle']",I Am Legend

657431,A38VQ2TIPPBKNN,B00005JPTK,"Sir Charles Panther ""Life is hard.  It's hard...","[3, 4]","This story had so many horrible plot holes that by the end I was glad it was over.  Will Smith doesn't sacrifice himself to save the world; he just wants out of the lousy story he's become a part of.The opening scene is a ridiculous, pathetic masturbatory commercial for the Ford Mustang GT500.  I mean, really, who would hunt deer from a speeding sports car, even if you actually could?  This opening had me shaking my head in disappointment, and the rest of the movie didn't take that feeling away.The CGI was lame, shallow and low-budge throughout.  Almost all of the viral-zombies (VZs) were CGI, and were not convincing.All the VZs did was run really fast, climb like vampire-monkeys, and of course open their mouths really wide and roar a lot.  Man, we've seen this dumbass mouthy-roaring gimmick a million times since it became the de rigueur monster stunt in the firstMummymovie.  Now it's just trite and predictable, and no longer effective.So, Will Smith is an Army LTC doctor, with a massive townhouse right on Washington Square in the heart of Manhattan, with a completely outfitted viral research suite in the basement?  And he has all of the trappings of the pre-Armageddon life because he's resourceful n' stuff n' all?  Yeah, puh-leeze.And he powers all this stuff in his house and the lab with three or four Honda--nice product placement!--generators, which we see running happily . . . in the flipping pantry!  Hollywood, there is this odorless, colorless gas, called carbon monoxide, which is emitted in the process of combustion, which . . . aw, the hell with it.In an abandoned city, the first electrical short or lightning strike will start a fire, which with everyone including the fire department dead, will burn out of control.  If there was such a struggle at the end of humanity, wouldn't there be a battle or two, maybe a little fire here and there?  In a city as dense as NYC, all of Manhattan would burn for weeks.  Nope, none of that, no evidence of it.  Just rusty cars and some grass in the cracks of the pavement.In a tense scene early on, we see the VZs for the first time in a very dark room strewn with bundles of money, a bank vault--on a second floor.  I mean, seriously, who puts a massive bank vault on the second floor?  Who reviews these settings and agrees to shoot them?If the VZs come out at night and are so flipping voracious, why are there so many deer running all over the island?  If animals can be infected, too, why are there so many deer running all over the island?If the VZs are so screamingly (literally) violent, why haven't they all killed and eaten each other yet?Our hero, the brilliant doctor, makes the crucial observation of the VZs that they have lost all semblance of human behavior, yet the VZ ""leader"" steals a mannequin from one of the hero's haunts, moves it to a crucial location, and sets a clever trap, clearly learned from watching the hero do the same thing earlier.  And then the VZ leader-guy sics three apparently trained--these are supposed to be completely unhinged, ultra-violent critters, right?--viral-zombie dogs on our hero.  I mean, if the VZs were this smart, why aren't they driving cars and carrying weapons themselves?Our hero has weapons stashed everywhere, and knows how to put them into action, too.  Until, that is, when it's time for things to go south and the finale to come.  Then he just can't hit a thing, even on full auto.  Junk.At the end, the VZ leader-guy breaks his way slowly through the unbreakable lab glass by smashing his head and body into it repeatedly, with no signs whatsoever of any kind of physical trauma.  But, uh, we've seen throughout the movie that although highly infected, and completely psycho, these VZ guys after all are physical beings which are more or less human in frame, strength and stamina, injured and killed with violence which would do the same to a human, even brought down by one or more shots from a firearm.  But when the Big Dramatic Finish comes, it's time for the VZ bad-guy leader to suddenly become so much more, an &uuml;ber-zombie, if you will.  Barf.Manhattan is an island, right?  How did the heroine-lady get onto it with her son?  And how did she get off?I will say this: Will Smith does do some pretty heavy acting in a couple of scenes, especially early on.  I'll give the man that much, with no reservations.  His environments may be CGI, but his acting is real, solid and powerful.  That German Shepherd was doing some pretty heavy ""acting,"" too--that was one really well-trained canine.Bottom line: I'm amazed this didn't get to DVD faster, given the shockingly inept story.  But the story Will Smith is working with is junk.  Don't pay to rent this.  Wait for it on video, or see it on a buddy's dime; then it will be worth your time.",2,"Inconsistent, with Gaping Plot Holes",1222387200,"09 26, 2008",2008,4791,"['story', 'had', 'so', 'many',

657432,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,B00005JPTK,Sirin,"[2, 2]","I am Legend is an interesting sci-fi conceit - a vaccine to cure cancer goes horrifically wrong - a viral strain leads to the formation of human mutant grotesques who have attacked and eaten all the other humans on earth. Will Smith is the only survivor (this is all conveyed at face value in the first moments of the film, for viewers of truncated IQ, don't worry, you don't have to think too hard to work it out).Will Smith (aka Robert Neville, a scientist with military connections) is the only man left on a post human manhattan - overgrown with weeds, buildings falling into decay and blasted bridges (the Brooklyn Bridge, despite being a suspension bridge, only seems to have lost its middle span). Leaping deer and barking dogs roam around the island by day, more sinister creatures prevail at night (the post human mutants) so Neville has to sleep cradling a gun in his bath in his heavily fortified apartment with only Sam, his faithful German shepherd for company).Neville, despite being the only human around, still manages to pick up electricity and fresh water. (He also works out fanatically to keep his abs sharp, and doesn't let his hair grow long or grow a scruffy beard, despite that fact that there are no women left to justify all that grooming). He goes slightly nuts devoid of human company, talking to his dog, and broadcasting on the airwaves to see if anyone is around.The first moments of the film have some interesting scenes in the lab as Neville experiments on gollumesque GCI creatures to see if he can establish why the cancer cure went wrong, and how he can reverse the strain and keep human life going in the most unpromising of circumstances. Dangers and madness assail Neville each day. He befriends two mannequins in a DVD store, and is disturbed to discover they have moved outside the store one morning. He loses his beloved dog, Sam, after he is bitten by mutant dogs who are released after a snare trap disables Neville and has to put him down. His experiments to cure the mutant grotesques and restore human life constantly founder. He is constantly threatened by the grotesque creatures who have done for everyone else who attack him in all manner of ghoulish CGI ways. Through flashbacks it is revealed that his attempts to airlift his family out of Manhattan in the US exodus from Saigon type scenes failed, and his family have all perished, along with he presumes every other human on earth.Being Hollywood, light comes in (sadly around the same moment as the budget clearly runs out and the director realised the movie needs to wrap up in a swift conclusion having blown a cool $15 million on a Brooklyn Bridge scene).

The last movie to do that for me was Alien.Will Smith is simply outstanding, and creates a role both convincing and provoking.  His companion also does an amazing job and combined really made me care about their outcome enough to see this movie through, white knuckles and all.Also, the best part about this action thriller is that it wasn't an all out blood and gore fest.  Where most films of this kind capitalize on making the audience squirm in their seats, this film is a psychological thriller.While I won't spoil it for those who still wish to view this movie, the disappointing part for me was in the last 10 minutes of the movie.  I suppose someone didn't like the CGI graphics and thought that it looked too fake.  Well CGI has yet to look otherwise, but I didn't think it looked fake and believed that they did a great job with the design, sets, action, definitely the fear factor, and most certainly the remaining storyline up until the last part of the movie.It was so disappointing as if the writers simply didn't know how to end the movie so they put together something last minute, stuck some gum on it, and sent it to final editing to get it produced for theaters.

I really wasn't expecting that much from the film. Obviously Will Smith was always going to be the films saviour even if it was a complete Turkey. But its not.I agree with most previous reviewers that the first half is the best part of the film. However IMO the 2nd half and the special effects are nowhere near as bad as some reviewers have made out. Only at one point in the film did I think ""thats CGI"". Will Smith is very good and the errie deserted streets and his relationship with the dog are very well done.The film is only 96 mins long, which is also in its favour. Unlike a lot of Hollywood blockbusters this doesn't feel like it should have much, if anything cut from it. Most crucially of all, Neville (Will Smith) was a sympathetic character. This film has that crucial element that is missing from so many bloated blockbusters - characters you care about.On the downside there are a few contrived moments in the plot that I didn't really believe in. To some extent I agree with previous reviewers criticisms about the ending, but in the end the filmmakers just about got the balance between a completely happy ending and a resolutely downbeat one.

Another in a string of apocalyptic fear-based family films, the cure for cancer has had an undesired side effect and wiped out the human population.  One man and his dog remain to combat this grave twist of events.  As if the setup of dwindling life isn't bleak enough, the solitary life of Smith's character and the daily effort to survive while seeking a cure creates some heart stopping moments and really creepy psychological provocations.  I went into this film assuming Smith would hold his usual action hero poise, and he does to some degree.  While he is a wonderful action hero in his career, Smith is at core a gifted dramatic actor and that talent comes through in this role.  The usual running scenes, blazing fires and such abound, but they are rooted in an emotional backstory that helps viewers to understand the main character's motivations.  In that light the story is very well-rounded.  Viewers receive the action-packed thriller laced with some fairly intense emotional scenes.  Then begins the second half.The scariest part of this film is the deserted streets of NYC.  All in all the film is well done, acting, direction...  but something about it was really off for me, which I can only assume was the writing.  Smith spends a lot of screen time alone and despite the challenge of having to hold the momentum of the story solo, he pulls it off.  I can't in any way fault him for my feeling that the film was incomplete.  It moves very slowly, adrenaline its only initiator of plot movement in some cases.  I do like that the writing showed the main character's struggle to remain sane under such circumstances.  Most often our end of days films focus more on the hero's feats than his assured flaws.  Still, there were such leaps in the plot that I was unconvinced of the direction it took.

657436,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B00005JPTK,Sky,"[1, 1]","Back in 1954, Richard Matheson wrote a 'Legendary' novel that inspired many authors and film makers. Stephen King often gives partial credit to Matheson for his categorical success (seeStephen King's Danse Macabre). Three film adaptations have been made of this ""Legendary"" novel. None of the three have ever done the novel true justice. But the most recent adaptation of Matheson's novel calledI Am Legendis perhaps the best movie of 2007.It's no secret that 2007's I Am Legend centers around the exploits of Will Smith playing the last man on Earth. And Smith is absolutely phenomenal as this modern day (2009 - 2012) survivor; he deserves an award for his portrayal as Dr. Robert Neville. The movie runs for 101 minutes and Smith occupies the screen pretty much solo for about 3-quarters of the movie...but rest assured...he's not alone.Fans of Matheson's novel should go into Director Francis Lawrence's 2007 film adaptation with an open mind. The key word is that this is an 'adaptation' inspired by the original novel. In fact, 2007's I Am Legend seems to not only be inspired by the novel, but also by the two prior film adaptations (The Last Man on Earth&The Omega Man; the 2007 film has elements of all three as well as some very cool original aspects.Lawrence does an excellent job at keeping viewers on the edge of their seats with taught suspense. Smith keeps you captivated from start to finish. The story is terrific. The action scenes are very well done. But the superhuman abilities of the 'night seekers' is a bit hard to swallow.In a nutshell, I look forward to the DVD release of I Am Legend, because I will certainly add it to my cart.DVD RELEASE UPDATE - 3-20-2008 -- The DVD release of I Am Legend includes an alternate ending option to the theatrical release. Watch it. It is dubbed the ""controversal ending"", but it is actually more true to the theme of the original idea created by Matheson that the title of the story is derived from.

It has a lot of parts were you do at least one of the following, jolt, jump or stop breathing. It's very funny at times and other parts it saddens your heart. If you're like me you'll like this movie. ""Why"" you ask, because it doesn't scare you to death, gets you to laugh and you figure out things could be more heartbreaking in your life. I would pay to watch this movie one hundred times and then pay to see it again. It's just that good. I wouldn't take a young child or someone who has nightmares at night to see this movie. If you like being scared and watching people die and go through tough times this movie is for you.A scientist, Robert Neville (Will Smith) is living with his trusty dog Sam in the new and deserted jungle New York. There was an epidemic and everyone who had ""Clear eyes"" or ""Good eyes"" was sent out of New York. Neville's wife and daughter were killed in a helicopter on their way out of New York. Sadly almost nobody made it through the travel. In New York Robert Neville lives an everyday life. He goes to the movie shop and gets and returns movies, he lives in his house, eats food and works out. He also hunts the prey running around, like the gazelle. A thing that isn't an ordinary thing that he does is he captures these sick humans that have turned into mutant creatures. He does this so he can try to find a cure for them. The way he captures them is by spilling blood onto a blanket and sets up a trap. He uses blood because the creatures are attracted to blood. He knocks them out cold and then takes the creatures to his house, into his basement and ties them down onto a stretcher. He gives a vaccine of some sort. Then they go wild.Many creatures have died while Dr. Neville tries to find a cure. As the Robert was driving around one day he sees his friend from the movie store ""Fred"", the manikin. Neville walks towards the manikin. He thinks the manikin is one of the mutant creature so he shoots at him with his gun. The manikin just shatters. As he gets closer he is swung up in the air by a rope and the taxi car near the side of the rode drops off the side of the road. It was a trap. He's knocked out and his dog Sam is barking at him. As it gets closer to dark he awakens and sees the creatures there inside the building about 10-15 yards away.He cuts the rope holding him up but stabs himself on the way down. The creatures have mutant dogs that are waiting for the sun to be blocked. They have to wait because the sun kills them and that's why they live in dark places. Sam protects her owner but she is badly wounded. Neville tries to kill himself but is saved by a woman named Anna and a boy named Ethan. The next morning when he woke up the place he stab himself was stitched up. The next night the manikins followed the scent of his blood and a whole army of manikins come towards the house. Will blows up part of them and saves Ethan and Anna. They head down towards the basement to hide.

657440,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B00005JPTK,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","This film is 'I Am Legend' in name only, it bears very little relation to the book of the same name. This aside, it is a fairly good movie with post apocalyptic themes and a storyline that will keep you interested for the 96 minutes duration. Will Smith plays the role of the relationship starved army medical researcher well. You really feel for him when he talks to mannequins and at his relationship with his dog. The action is pretty good, although the computer graphics left a lot to be desired, both the various animals and the 'dark seekers' seemed very dated compared to other computer graphics films. This is an OK film, that should keep you watching until the end. As long as you don't expect a faithful rendering of the book you should be fine. Watch it with an open mind and you'll get what it sets out to be, an action film that shows another side of Will's acting and how one copes on his own in a world where everyone else is dead!

657441,A17QWJEEELWETQ,B00005JPTK,spiders-n-vinegaroons,"[1, 2]","SPOILERS BELOWI honestly thought this was going to be another Will Smith blockbuster movie, but I'm still wondering what happened in the middle of shooting this film??  Was there a tiff between Smith and the director, or the direcor and the producer?  Who knows.  The first half hour of this film is typical Smith action movie.  You are reminded of movies like Independance Day and War of the Worlds right off the bat.  It's an empty city and Smith is the only survivor.  Can you imagine the possibilities for this film??How the story presents itself is through flashbacks.  Smith is a Military Commander and he apparently is in charge of finding the cure for this deadly virus that instead of curing its patients, is practically killing them.  But that's not all of it though.  Apparently, some humans are not dying, but turning into bloodthirsty vampires who only live in the dark and have supernatural strength apparently.  Sounds crazy huh?  Well, the movie still deserves a chance despite that ridiculous premise.  I gave it a chance, but could only find myself counting the flaws and holes in the plot all throughout.  The issues I had with this film were certain holes that were in the story and certain things that were left out that were critical to making this a believable story.  It's hard to believe, but with a story so complex as this, this movie should have been over 2 hours.  It's not, it's well under and leaves a lot more to be desired.The one scene that perplexes me is the scene with the mannequin that was placed as a trap.  Smith flips out that a mannequin that he saw at the video store was placed somewhere else in the city.  Now here's where it gets fishy.  Smith has acknowledged that the vampires have lost all human abilities, yet for some reason that trap was set up for him in front of that building.  I was asking myself, who set it up, the vampires or Smith himself?  And if he set it up himself, why would he forget about it and go crazy as a result?  The better answer was that the vampires weren't that primitive afterall, but intelligent and were setting the trap to catch Smith and eat him I guess.  My question is, why didn't they run with that story, why didn't they play the cat and mouse game after that?  Instead, the film takes the direction of Smith's paranoia and depression in a lonely world until miraculously 2 people come to New York to save him.  They briefly manage to get into an argument about God of all things (hidden message), and what results is a failed rescue attempt by 2 people who really wouldn't have the courage to drive all the way down there to find Smith in the first place.The ending is quite abrupt and provides no closure to the story.  Aside from the first half of the movie and various special effects, this movie is a huge bust in my opinion.  This could have been a thriller movie as man versus monster, but the story is about man versus conscience and man versus duty that ultimately plays out as a dull narrative as how one man reacts to the isolation around him.D+",2,Disappointing,1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,3043,"['SPOILERS', 'BELOWI', 'honestly', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Will', 'Smith', 'blockbuster', 'movie', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'middle', 'shooting', 'film', 'Was', 'tiff', 'Smith', 'director', 'direcor', 'producer', 'Who', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'typical', 'Smith', 'action', 'movie', 'are', 'reminded', 'movies', 'Independance', 'Day', 'War', 'Worlds', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'empty', 'city', 'Smith', 'only', 'survivor', 'Can', 'imagine', 'possibilities', 'film', 'How', 'story', 'presents', 'flashbacks', 'Smith', 'Military', 'Commander', 'apparently', 'charge', 'finding', 'cure', 'deadly', 'virus', 'instead', 'curing', 'patients', 'practically', 'killing', 'not', 'Apparently', 'humans', 'are', 'not', 'dying', 'turning', 'bloodthirsty', 'vampires', 'who', 'only', 'live', 'dark', 'have', 'supernatural', 'strength', 'apparently', 'crazy', 'huh', 'Well', 'movie', 'still', 'chance', 'ridiculous', 'premise', 'gave', 'chance', 'could', 'only', 'find', 'counting', 'flaws', 'holes', 'plot', 'issues', 'had', 'film', 'were', 'certain', 'holes', 'were', 'story', 'certain', 'things', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'were', 'critical', 'making', 'believable', 'story', 'hard', 'believe', 'story', 'so', 'complex', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', '2', 'hours', 'not', 'well', 'lot', 'more', 'be', 'desired.The', 'one', 'scene', 'scene', 'mannequin', 'was', 'placed', 'trap', 'Smith', 'out', 'mannequin', 'saw', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'placed', 'somewhere', 'else', 'city', 'Now', 'here', 'where', 'fishy', 'Smith', 'acknowledged', 'vampires', 'have', 'lost', 'human', 'abilities', 'yet', 'reason', 'trap', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'front', 'building', 'was', 'asking', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'vampires', 'Smith', 'set', 'up', 'why', 'would', 'forget', 'go', 'crazy', 'result', 'better', 'answer', 'was', 'vampires', 'were', ""n't"", 'primitive', 'afterall', 'intelligent', 'were', 'setting', 'trap', 'catch', 'Smith', 'eat', 'guess', 'question', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'run', 'story', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Instead', 'film', 'direction', 'Smith', 'paranoia', 'depression', 'lonely', 'world', 'miraculously', '2', 'people', 'come', 'New', 'York', 'save', 'briefly', 'manage', 'get', 'argument', 'God', 'things', 'hidden', 'message', 'what', 'results', 'failed', 'rescue', 'attempt', '2', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'courage', 'drive', 'way', 'there', 'find', 'Smith', 'first', 'place.The', 'ending', 'quite', 'abrupt', 'closure', 'story', 'Aside', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'various', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'huge', 'bust', 'opinion', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'thriller', 'movie', 'man', 'versus', 'monster', 'story', 'man', 'versus', 'conscience', 'man', 'versus', 'duty', 'ultimately', 'out', 'dull', 'narrative', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'isolation', 'him.D+']",I Am Legend

657443,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B00005JPTK,SteakSalad101,"[2, 4]","What happens when in modern times, a revolutionary, almost too-good-to-be-true solution to a life threatening, scary problem appears and seems to be the cure for everything that goes wrong? As if someone walked up to you one day and said ""Oh, hi, here's a magical box that if you keep it with you all the time, you will never be sick, never have problems, and have a long lasting life."" Would you still feel the same about your life and the people in it? And would you rely on this so much...that it would destroy you? What if that solution was the cure for cancer? ""I Am Legend"" is a fascinating, new post-apocalyptic thriller starring veteran actor Will Smith. When the cure for cancer is brought upon humanity, and the drug is administered to patients, hell breaks loose. A virus is created, that starts as side effects to the drug. One day in New York, the virus mutates and ends infecting everyone on the planet, with a 90% kill rate. The virus takes these people and transforms them into possessive zombie-like creatures that are deathly afraid of the light and come out at night to hunt for survivors of the virus.Robert Neville, a brilliant scientist, is apparently the only survivor of this pandemic, being somehow completely immune to the mutated virus. He lives alone with his dog Samantha who is also immune to the air-borne strain of the virus only in New York City, which has been completely deserted. He sends out radio signals to search for other survivors while trying to maintain his sanity and test samples of the virus in his lab he has in his basement. Everything seems OK for him, from strolling the disturbingly empty, weed-ridden streets of Manhattan, driving golf balls from rooftops, and taking unrestricted tours of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Until the night comes. At his watch's beep, Neville bolts himself into his house to protect him and Samantha from what's out there--the remaining 90% of the world's population who want to infect Neville and Samantha. He mustn't be seen in the darkness to avoid the zombie/human creatures who watch his every move, waiting for him to slip up. As if this wasn't enough, Neville is plagued with dreams of the final moments of human civilization, when the aggressive decision is made to quarantine New York City, and the horrific death of his wife and daughter.I know what you're thinking--that I Am Legend sounds like a corny, cheesy, over-used, washed up, unoriginal B-movie Hollywood pile of crap. I can assure you, it is far from that. The film is scientifically fascinating (even from a person who despises the thought of science class) and is like a window onto our own current society that where we're headed, trying to fix everything, can end in horrific situations. The images of post-day New York are extremely disturbing and horrifying, especially if you're familiar with the city as I am, from living in its metro area. Images of a blowing, dusty Times Square, complete with its usual screens and advertisements, except with cracks in the street, weeds growing out, and no people--something that anyone who's ever been to New York will tell you is simply impossible.The movie seems to be two-faced. There is a dire, extremely thought provoking sense of caution and tensity throughout the film, even in the calm scenes, that inspires otherworldly levels of suspense. You can do anything you like in the Big Apple that is now 100% deserted--except go out at night. This makes the film both extremely entertaining, very fascinating to watch, and utterly terrifying.Apart from all of that, ""I Am Legend"" is the scariest film I've seen all year. By far. And it's not everyday a PG-13 receives that reward. Not only the premise of being totally alone in a disturbingly deserted huge city that used to be home to over eight million, but in other ways as well. Unlike other zombie movies, which may you leave you laughing, ""I Am Legend"" has got the stuff to leave you shielding your eyes and shaking in fear. I know it had me scared out of my mind. Some of the scenes are extremely intense, grotesque, and the movie is jam-packed with utterly horrifying jump scenes that had my completely packed theater jumping out of their seats (and no, it wasn't just me). I could say that this movie is scarier than all four ""Saw"" films combined. Therefore--unless you can take a very scary movie, it might be a good idea to pass this one up. I feel sorry for those who saw it in IMAX. But if you can take the horror, get your tickets. If one movie this season deserves your ticket money, make it ""Legend."" The film is extremely well crafted and executed. Francis Lawrence delivers incredibly good direction and the editing is very well done, with horrifying flashbacks to a panicked New York, and makes the film that much more fascinating to watch. There is a strange sense of realism in the movie, something that'll make you think, ""Could this be where we're headed?"" Not in the sense of zombies, of course, but in other disasters. The only complaints I have with this film is the ending was much less than satisfactory, and in my taste, was a bit too clich&eacute;d. The second half of the film is still very good, but fails to deliver the tensity, horror, and strange fascination that the first half brings.So, if you're looking for a way out of a bunch of dumb laughable zombie movies, and searching for one that actually scares the crap out of you, check out ""I Am Legend.""

657445,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B00005JPTK,Steffan Piper,"[17, 25]","Dr. Robert Neville seems to have more incarnations than Sherlock Holmes at this point. From humble beginnings, birthing slowly in the unlit corner of the one bedroom apartment and rising from the cheap laminate desk of Richard Matheson -- this character seemed destined for greatness. Theoriginal storyreads painfully, is half cheese, half camp ... but strains the eyes continuously, and has a feel to it that is quite moving and worthy of film, graphic novel or some other type of legacy yet unknown.It would seem unlikely that this movie could be compared in anyway to the original short story / novella that shares the same title. In fact, the title might just be the only similarity. My Chinese wife, when she heard about them remaking this - yet again, said: ""Robert Neville is very repetitively described as a blonde haired, blue eyed white man in the book. Will Smith? I gotta see that."" Needless to say, the horror and action fan that she is, she was heavily disappointed in this as it seemed to be its own entity, instead of sharing even the most remote similarity with the book or even the previous films in any way conceivable.I guess it would be foolish to state that this is the only film to have deviated so far, but we all know that isn't the truth by a long shot.The Omega Man,The Running Man,Total Recall,Minority Reportand evenBlade Runnerall differ from their original source material - some heavily while others subtly. Who's to say whether this practice is right or wrong? Some of these films are blockbusters while others are heavily dated and total flops. Apparently, Matheson, not only approved of this version, but stated that he thought it was the best so far. Maybe he was referencing the size of the licensing contract and repetitive royalty amounts, surely he couldn't be favouring this over the Charleton Heston version.But what is it about Hollywood that seems to believe that good books just don't translate onto the screen? All the films I previously mentioned are decent books that would've made good direct adaptations, and I can say this confidently because the adjusted adaptations were nothing memorable or impacting, all with the exception of Blade Runner. Giving credit where credit is due,Forrest Gumpmade an interesting adaptation from a sub-par book to an excellent film.  But this type of foolish recklessness is unfortunately more prevalent in the Science-Fiction genre when it comes to adaptations.When I saw this movie at Target, it was on sale for $15.99, but beside it was another version for $24.99 that had the `controversial ending'. So, now, we must either pay an extra ten bucks to see the version where the Vampire Zombies have any level of noticeable intellect and show a glimmer of cunning, or we end up getting both versions for $35, because we just HAVE to see the other version. They used to market these `other versions' for two or three dollars more, which I used to have no problem with, but this is just unforgivable. Double-dipping is understandable in some cases, like with `Donnie Darko'. Numerous years passed until the Director had a chance to make his desired corrections, and when they were made,another DVDwas released. What `I Am Legend' is trying to do is just foolish. The alternate ending is not worth the ten dollars, so save your money. And, sigh ... don't worry what I just told you is nothing close to a spoiler. So if you haven't seen any of the films or ever read the book, you're none the wiser, but hopefully a little more informed.I also found the use of the soundtrack was superficial and annoying. A lot of opportunities were wasted on this film, the soundtrack is probably one of the biggest ones, as it could've equated into more revenue for the producers and distributors of this let down. `28 Days Later', a film that really raised the bar on these type of `chaos reality' films, has a groundbreaking soundtrack with even a few tracks (18 and 20) that are deeply reminiscent of the score that was used in `The Omega Man' and were quite moving. The majority of James Newton Howard's score wasn't even used in the film. The film was overwrought with so much Foley nonsense (action, explosion, sound effects) that the actual composition for this movie had been dialed into the off position or forgotten about entirely. Shame on the mix done in post by the sound board hacks guzzling diet Pepsi. James Newton Howard may have attempted to repeat his success here from the `Batman Begins' soundtrack, but apart from a few memorable moments, the majority of the musical score here is just way too slow, boring and very forgettable.Since I've noted `28 Days Later', let me just say that that `film' probably had a lot of creative impact on this `movie' from its inception or first utterance of ""let's remake `The Omega Man'"". `28 Days Later' and `28 Weeks' later recouped more money than either of their primary budgets, thus sending signals to Hollywood, that these types of films would essentially be good vehicles for their leading stars. The problem here is that even though you put bankable stars into a bankable idea it doesn't necessarily equate to a success. Also '28 Days Later' is probably the high water mark of all horror zombie films. Danny Boyle set the bar so high that other imitators will likely fail to even come within groveling distance.This movie's major flaws were the deviation in the writing and not adhering to enough of the other films or the original novella. Reciting lines from `Shrek' when confronted with other survivors was also another poor use of story, viewer time and appreciation of the material or the genre. The use of the mannequins was a nice touch to the creepy, artsy feel that was readily prevalent in `The Omega Man' but it just wasn't enough to admit that it's a worthy adaptation.

O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","In ""I Am Legend"" the apocalypse has hit the world, a man-made virus intended for good, intended to cure cancer, but gone horribly awry.  On a planet now populated by hordes of mutated, vampire-like victims of the plague, a surviving military scientist (Will Smith, in his best performance), somehow immune to the disease, works in a fortified house to find a cure, walking the city with his canine companion in search of specimens to test various experimental treatments on, and in search for survivors.He's set up a radio transmitter that sends out messages on all frequencies urging any other survivors to meet him at a certain time and place to band together, but day after day, year after year, he finds no one there to meet him.  Interspersed with the post-apocalyptic time frame we see frequent flashbacks showing the early days when the 'cure' was going wrong, and global panic was breaking out.  The plague victims are nightmarish creatures, shirking from the sun, ravenous, violent and mindless.  During the nights the doctor barricades himself and his companion inside the house, but the ghastly creatures are out there, always.  It's a bleak world being presented, but done well.  I've noted before that 'bleak' is among the hardest moods to do right in a movie, but I Am Legend does it brilliantly.  Part of it is that the grim mood is punctuated by touches of the idyllic: the abandoned city beginning to look alive again as all this beautiful greenery creeps in, deer bounding about...but there's nothing idyllic or peaceful once you get into the shadows where the creatures dwell.  One of the creatures, in particular, is especially disturbing: he seems much smarter than the others, seems angrier than the others, and the others are starting to follow his lead.**WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD***Eventually, Smith's character does come across another survivor, two actually: a woman and her little boy.  Instead of just relief, tension soon follows.  Smith has by this point become utterly defeated psychologically and spiritually - he no longer believes there's any hope of his finding a way of reversing the mutation, he's lost faith in just about everything, and he reacts with disbelief and almost anger as she claims God guided her to him, and her claims that an entire colony of survivors is out there waiting for them.Where the movie goes from here I'll refrain from hinting at, but it continues developing.  A lot of what happens in the latter parts are highly interpretative, and fascinating.  The movie does miss a couple of opportunities, and is a bit slow in places, but those minor hindrances are blown away by the overall power of the movie.

It includes a Digital Copy which tells you to insert the 2nd disc into your PC, select Digital Copy from the menu and enter an authorization code included inside the cover.  Maybe this doesn't work on Macs but I don't get a Digital Copy menu when I insert the disc into my Mac Pro.  Maybe someone can advise me on how to do this properly other than by ripping it with Handbrake or some similar software,Okay, got that request out of the way so here is the Blu Ray review which only focuses on the quality of the Blu Ray transfer, both audio and video.  No acting critiques, plot summaries or evaluations of the practicality of this event occurring or CGI effects. (The male lion doesn't quite make it IMHO)  Not sure which I like better, the theatrical or alternate release, both put a different spin on things and both are fine.The Standard Def version was really quite good, the Blu Ray's audio tops it for clarity if not directionality and making full use of your complete sound system.  The original audio editing was top notch.  There is a definite improvement with the Blu Ray which contains both the theatrical and alternate releases of the film but since the regular DVD was as good as it was in the audio editing, the improvement does not make for a night and day comparison.  It is lossless audio and that is about the best you're going to get it.  The opening scenes really envelope you in the sight and sounds of the stricken city.The video transfer is equally excellent with sharp contrast and wonderful color saturation when appropriate.  The dark scenes looked a touch crushed in the blacks to me but detail was still there, no question about it.  I saw no grain even in the darkest of scenes.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,I AM LEGEND on Blu Ray,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,2132,"['have', 'owned', 'two', 'disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Standard', 'Def', 'time', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'insert', '2nd', 'disc', 'PC', 'select', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'menu', 'enter', 'authorization', 'code', 'included', 'cover', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'work', 'Macs', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'menu', 'when', 'insert', 'disc', 'Mac', 'Pro', 'Maybe', 'someone', 'can', 'advise', 'how', 'do', 'properly', 'other', 'ripping', 'Handbrake', 'similar', 'software', 'Okay', 'got', 'request', 'way', 'so', 'here', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'review', 'only', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer', 'audio', 'video', 'No', 'acting', 'critiques', 'plot', 'summaries', 'evaluations', 'practicality', 'event', 'occurring', 'CGI', 'effects', 'male', 'lion', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'IMHO', 'Not', 'sure', 'like', 'better', 'theatrical', 'alternate', 'release', 'put', 'different', 'spin', 'things', 'are', 'fine.The', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'audio', 'clarity', 'not', 'directionality', 'making', 'full', 'use', 'complete', 'sound', 'system', 'original', 'audio', 'editing', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'definite', 'improvement', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'theatrical', 'alternate', 'releases', 'film', 'regular', 'DVD', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'audio', 'editing', 'improvement', 'not', 'make', 'night', 'day', 'comparison', 'lossless', 'audio', 'best', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'opening', 'scenes', 'really', 'envelope', 'sight', 'sounds', 'stricken', 'city.The', 'video', 'transfer', 'equally', 'excellent', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'wonderful', 'color', 'saturation', 'when', 'appropriate', 'dark', 'scenes', 'looked', 'touch', 'crushed', 'blacks', 'detail', 'was', 'still', 'there', 'question', 'saw', 'grain', 'even', 'darkest', 'scenes.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",I Am Legend

657451,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00005JPTK,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 2]","I Am Legend (2007)Drama, Science Fiction, Thriller, 101 minutesDirected by Francis LawrenceStarring Will Smith and Alice BragaWill Smith is one of the biggest box office draws, whether it's for action, comedy or drama. He has the charisma to pull off just about any role and is improving as a dramatic actor as he matures. I Am Legend contains some action, but it's a futuristic drama more than anything else. Smith is required to show considerable range.The movie makes this list because it shows how people adapt in extreme situations. Robert Neville (Smith) is possibly the last man alive after a cure for cancer turns people into aggressive zombie-like creatures who live in the dark. He's a scientist and appears to have a natural immunity to the virus. He's trying to develop a vaccine that will help these creatures recover their humanity.Imagine if you had an entire city to yourself. How would you spend your time? Neville has a routine. He wakes up at the same time each day, works out, and then systematically searches the buildings in the area for canned food and bottled water. This is vital for his survival. He also continues his research and tries out his vaccines on laboratory rats. In order to maintain the illusion that he's not alone, he watches recorded TV shows and talks to mannequins while he works his way through the inventory of a local video store. Every day at Noon, he waits at a predetermined location for any response to his radio messages offering hope and shelter to other survivors.New York is an abandoned city. Grass has reclaimed most of the land and Neville has to compete with lions when he goes hunting for dear. The early special effects are very convincing and we are drawn in to Neville's world. Some of the exposition is achieved through showing Neville's dreams and we discover that his wife and daughter were evacuated along with the other healthy people left in the city. His only friend now is Sam, his dog. Unlike Neville, Sam can be affected by contact with the creatures roaming the city.One of the saddest scenes in the movie comes after Sam is bitten by a creature carrying the virus. He injects her with serum in the hope that it will prevent her from transforming into a deadly version of his former companion. If you are an animal-lover, it's a hard scene to watch.I won't ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it. Is Neville really alone? Will he develop a cure? If he does, will it even be possible to capture the creatures and successfully administer the cure?The film raises a serious question; are humans the biggest threat to their own survival?The Blu-ray includes an alternate ending. Both endings are hopeful, but one is considerably more hopeful than the other.

The alternate theatrical cut of the film is basically the same except for the ending, which is weaker than the other one.

657453,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005JPTK,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[143, 185]","This third incarnation of Richard Matheson's masterpiece is superior to its predecessors in every way, but in spite of that achievement the film is still lacking and comes across as a disappointment in too many ways.I can't bear to rehash the plot as nearly everyone knows this story by now, and if you are one of the few unfamiliar with this story, then please read Amazon's well-written synopsis or Trashcanman's excellent review in the Spotlight review section.  I just plan to hit what I enjoyed about this film and what was so disappointing.The Hits:(1) Another top-notch, winning performance by the ever reliable and likable Will Smith.(2) Outstanding set designs combined with CGI effects of a desolate and abandoned New York City make this film seem more important than it is.(3) Best adaptation of Matheson's highly influential novel (even if it isn't the most faithful to the story in a literal sense --it captures the spirit of his work extremely well).The Misses:(1) The most glaring problem with this film, in my view, is the CGI effects for the vampire-like survivors of the plague.  They are too cartoonish for me and appear far too much like video game villains.  A good example of this for me is the early scene where Smith's character enters a building to get his dog and finds some zombies hiding in a corner.  They are real people, not CGI, and they are frightening; however, later, when he's attacked by CGI zombies, it is unintentionally humorous as they appear like Gollum from LOTR on acid.  The CGI effects are either not believable or just too over-the-top, thus, the scenes with them lose their punch.(2) Uneven pacing of the story is a problem here.  The opening segments give the impression that we are going to see a masterpiece here, but the second half of the film never matches the first half and it feels very rushed.  It has that ""hey, guys, we just ran out of money, so we have to wrap up this film up this week"" feel to it.  In a film with a deliberate and nearly dignified opening to fall into a shoddy rushed finale severely hurts this film and leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.The film is still solid entertainment in spite of its obvious and significant flaws.  It is probably one I will even buy when it becomes available on DVD later, but it is rather disappointing for a film that seemed to have so much going for it.  Its box office receipts may reinforce that perception as it set opening weekend records with a take of about $77 million, but by its third weekend it only grossed about $15 million and that is a severe drop off.  For a film that reportedly cost $150 to make it has grossed a disappointing $228 after a month at the box-office.  That doesn't even qualify it has a hit with a mere $78 million dollar profit at this point.  I do think it will be a hit after it's been released world-wide.BTW:  Some may ask, ""What is a hit by today's standards?""  That's a good question with really no one set answer, however, Hollywood traditionally likes to see a film generate double what it cost to make in order to classify a film as a hit.  This film with a cost of $150 million to make is expected to earn $300 million to be considered a hit, but certain stars, like Will Smith, are expected to bring in better than double the cost of the film (hence, why this may end up being considered a ""disappointment"" at the box-office even if it hits the magic $300M mark).",3,"[3.5] A good film, but well below expectations.",1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,3415,"['third', 'incarnation', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'masterpiece', 'superior', 'predecessors', 'way', 'spite', 'achievement', 'film', 'still', 'lacking', 'across', 'disappointment', 'too', 'many', 'ways.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'rehash', 'plot', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'story', 'now', 'are', 'one', 'few', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'then', 'please', 'read', 'Amazon', 'well-written', 'synopsis', 'Trashcanman', 'excellent', 'review', 'Spotlight', 'review', 'section', 'just', 'plan', 'hit', 'what', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'disappointing.The', 'Hits', '1', 'top-notch', 'winning', 'performance', 'ever', 'reliable', 'likable', 'Will', 'Smith', '2', 'Outstanding', 'set', 'designs', 'combined', 'CGI', 'effects', 'desolate', 'abandoned', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'important', '3', 'Best', 'adaptation', 'Matheson', 'highly', 'influential', 'novel', 'even', ""n't"", 'most', 'faithful', 'story', 'literal', 'sense', 'spirit', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', '.The', 'Misses', '1', 'most', 'glaring', 'problem', 'film', 'view', 'CGI', 'effects', 'vampire-like', 'survivors', 'plague', 'are', 'too', 'cartoonish', 'appear', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'video', 'game', 'villains', 'good', 'example', 'early', 'scene', 'where', 'Smith', 'character', 'building', 'get', 'dog', 'zombies', 'hiding', 'corner', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'CGI', 'are', 'frightening', 'however', 'later', 'when', 'attacked', 'CGI', 'zombies', 'unintentionally', 'humorous', 'appear', 'Gollum', 'LOTR', 'acid', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'either', 'not', 'believable', 'just', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'thus', 'scenes', 'lose', 'punch', '2', 'Uneven', 'pacing', 'story', 'problem', 'here', 'opening', 'segments', 'give', 'impression', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'masterpiece', 'here', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'never', 'first', 'half', 'very', 'rushed', 'hey', 'guys', 'just', 'ran', 'money', 'have', 'wrap', 'up', 'film', 'up', 'week', 'feel', 'film', 'deliberate', 'nearly', 'dignified', 'opening', 'fall', 'shoddy', 'rushed', 'finale', 'severely', 'film', 'bad', 'taste', 'one', 'mouth.The', 'film', 'still', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'spite', 'obvious', 'significant', 'flaws', 'probably', 'one', 'will', 'even', 'buy', 'when', 'available', 'DVD', 'later', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'film', 'seemed', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'may', 'reinforce', 'perception', 'set', 'opening', 'weekend', 'records', 'take', 'about', '77', 'million', 'third', 'weekend', 'only', 'grossed', '15', 'million', 'severe', 'drop', 'off', 'film', 'reportedly', 'cost', '150', 'make', 'grossed', 'disappointing', '228', 'month', 'box-office', ""n't"", 'even', 'qualify', 'hit', 'mere', '78', 'million', 'dollar', 'profit', 'point', 'do', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'hit', 'been', 'released', 'world-wide.BTW', 'may', 'ask', 'What', 'hit', 'today', 'standards', 'good', 'question', 'really', 'one', 'set', 'answer', 'however', 'Hollywood', 'traditionally', 'see', 'film', 'generate', 'double', 'what', 'cost', 'make', 'order', 'classify', 'film', 'hit', 'film', 'cost', '150', 'million', 'make', 'expected', 'earn', '300', 'million', 'be', 'considered', 'hit', 'certain', 'stars', 'Will', 'Smith', 'are', 'expected', 'bring', 'better', 'double', 'cost', 'film', 'hence', 'why', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'considered', 'disappointment', 'box-office', 'even', 'magic', '300M', 'mark']",I Am Legend

One stunning aspect of the movie is the great art direction. New York is bathed in vegetation and ruins that it is impossible to say it was a set. The scale of this set, whether it was computer aided or not, was breathtaking. However CG work on the zombies was poor. They looked too phony. In an era where special fx has been perfected to a science the zombies were unacceptable.Will Smith's role, the story, screenplay and action were superb indeed. The way a lonely scientist lives to preserve his sanity, by play-acting - talking to the mannequins in the store as though they were real people, renting and returning DVD's besides other activities such as talking to his dog, saying the lines of the film, singing songs, cooking and not forgetting excercising are all very well done. The concept of defending himself from the zombies at night was also very cleverly and painstakingly done.Two very thrilling points in the movie are 1. Smith's first confrontation with the zombies (for those who haven't seen the trailers it is a terrific relevation at that point) and 2. The sighting of the mannequin on the road and the scenes that follow when the zombies trick him and later attack him.One question that lingered in my mind was why didn't Will Smith not test animals that survived the epidemic and find out a cure from their blood instead of testing himself and the zombies. The animals seemed to have survived the calamity perfectly.Bob Marley's songs were another sweet plus to a movie as this. Redemption Song played at the end of the movie was the icing on the cake.An alternative ending is being circulated on the net but this one in the original is certainly better.

WIlliams,"[3, 6]","I just recently saw this film (in HD for the first time, having been too young to see the story in other incarnations and not a sci-fi fan in general, so without ever having read the original work it's (rather loosely, I gather) based on.Maybe it was simply my state of mind when I sat down to watch, but rarely have I felt so despondent after seeing a movie. It wasn't the typical ""gotcha"" of a horror film, or the vampire-like bad guys that grossed me out, but the complete and utter bleakness of the tale.There is a scene--and it's a small moment, early in the film, so I don't think I'm giving anything away--where a woman tries to give up her child to a total stranger, in order to, she hopes, save him. A moment that has been done in countless films, and could have been truly hackneyed, but was portrayed so poignantly and with such straight-forward emotion, it made me want to wake up my own son just to hug him tightly. I absolutely felt and believed the utter hopelessness that would bring on such an act.Not to give anything away, but there is a later scene of loss so gut-wrenching (involving Will Smith's character's only companion, the dog) that I literally couldn't watch, even though I'm a grown woman who knows it's just a movie. (I literally put my hands in front of my eyes and said to my husband, ""I don't like this movie"" over and over. And I'm not normally the squeamish type.)And, unbelievably, the story only gets grimmer from there.This is a movie that kept me up for hours after watching it with nightmare-ish thoughts and a terrible overall tenseness. I had to keep reminding myself that things really were OK. And, no, I wasn't worried vampire-like creatures had overtaken the Earth ... It was just the film's pervading sense of desperation and bleakness that disturbed and, not to be pun-ny, ""infected"" me after seeing ""I Am Legend.""In a way, that is a testament to Will Smith as an actor and his ability to carry and characterize a film.

It's a highly intelligent read, and I recommend it.Saying that, this movie got the ""Legend"" completely wrong... but that's the 'third act collapse' and everyone goes on about that.Saying that, none of this movie's flaws have anything to do with Will Smith.  Will Smith proved that he could really act as something other than ""Will Smith Versus The X"" in /Pursuit of Happiness/, and here he proves that he can act when he really does have the screen all to himself, with no one else but a dog to distract from him.  I actually think he even one-ups Tom Hank's performance in /Cast Away/, for *SPOILER ALERT* when his character actually meets another two live human beings, he's been alone for three years and has practically forgotten how to relate to them (Hanks' character seemed to adapt to his return to humanity almost instantly).

Fortunately, the Blu-Ray disk includes an Alternative version with a far superior ending  (and one that is considerably more faithful to the spirit of Matheson's novel).

657466,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00005JPTK,Terry Mesnard,"[65, 75]","I Am Legend can't get a fair shake.  This Will Smith-led production is the third attempt Hollywood has made to adapt the brilliant novel.  None of the adaptions have truly done the novel justice (which is a shame), but this version has come the closest.Here we have a brilliant beginning; footage of a scientist (played beautifully by Emma Thompson) saying humbly that she's discovered a way to cure cancer.  Fast forward a few years, and New York is utterly devoid of human life, save for Robert Neville (Will Smith).  As the first half of the film progresses, we learn about his meager living, spending the day harvesting and trying to discover a cure, even now, while spending the night huddled in his protected home as creatures prowl.His only companion, a wonderful dog named Sam, protects Neville as Neville protects him.  They have a friendship based on loneliness and the human need for someone or something to hold onto.  Sam is Neville's only connection to the past and the only way to represent what little humanity is left, either in the world or Neville himself.  This period in the movie is pitch perfect, puncuated by one or two terrifying sequences that instill genuine horror.Unfortunately, the last half of the film deteriorates into an action movie that completely changes the meaning of the words ""I Am Legend.""  Don't get me wrong, it's mostly done really well.  Constantine director Francis Lawrence has a good handle on the action and delivers some good scenes.  But, it becomes muddled and veers off completely from the novel.  My biggest complaint, though, is the use of CGI.  Instead of using real flesh and blood actors, all of the creatures are created with CG and they look incredibly fake when lined up next to real people.  In the beginning, it's not a problem but as you see more of them (and you will) it's glaringly obvious.  And annoying.All of this I was expecting going in, though.  Considering that the film was co-written by Akiva Goldsman who also wrote I, Robot, I knew this version would stray from the source material just as I, Robot did.  As a movie, it's genuinely thrilling and creates the perfect balance of tension and action through most of its entirety.  And, surprisingly, Will Smith shows that he's a really good actor as he has to not only tackle many conflicting emotions during the two hour run time but he also has to do so without having much of anyone to react to.  Spending a good hour or so without another single actor for Will Smith to work with was a gamble and it paid off.Your enjoyment of the film is entirely based on what you bring to the table.  If you're coming to this film expecting to see the book come to life you'll be sorely disappointed.  However, if you're looking for a good action movie that actually has a good story and a human aspect, you'll be hard-pressed to find one as thrilling recently.",4,Color me surprised,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,2876,"['Am', 'Legend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'fair', 'shake', 'Will', 'Smith-led', 'production', 'third', 'attempt', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'adapt', 'brilliant', 'novel', 'None', 'adaptions', 'have', 'truly', 'done', 'novel', 'justice', 'shame', 'version', 'come', 'closest.Here', 'have', 'brilliant', 'beginning', 'footage', 'scientist', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'saying', 'humbly', 'discovered', 'way', 'cure', 'cancer', 'Fast', 'forward', 'few', 'years', 'New', 'York', 'utterly', 'devoid', 'human', 'life', 'save', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'Will', 'Smith', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'learn', 'meager', 'living', 'spending', 'day', 'harvesting', 'trying', 'discover', 'cure', 'even', 'now', 'spending', 'night', 'huddled', 'protected', 'home', 'creatures', 'only', 'companion', 'wonderful', 'dog', 'named', 'Sam', 'Neville', 'Neville', 'have', 'friendship', 'based', 'loneliness', 'human', 'need', 'someone', 'something', 'hold', 'onto', 'Sam', 'Neville', 'only', 'connection', 'past', 'only', 'way', 'represent', 'what', 'little', 'humanity', 'left', 'either', 'world', 'Neville', 'period', 'movie', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'puncuated', 'one', 'two', 'terrifying', 'sequences', 'instill', 'genuine', 'horror.Unfortunately', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'action', 'movie', 'completely', 'meaning', 'words', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'mostly', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'Constantine', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'good', 'handle', 'action', 'delivers', 'good', 'scenes', 'muddled', 'veers', 'off', 'completely', 'novel', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'use', 'CGI', 'Instead', 'using', 'real', 'flesh', 'blood', 'actors', 'creatures', 'are', 'created', 'CG', 'look', 'incredibly', 'fake', 'when', 'lined', 'up', 'next', 'real', 'people', 'beginning', 'not', 'problem', 'see', 'more', 'will', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'annoying.All', 'was', 'expecting', 'going', 'Considering', 'film', 'was', 'co-written', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Robot', 'knew', 'version', 'would', 'stray', 'source', 'material', 'just', 'Robot', 'did', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'thrilling', 'perfect', 'balance', 'tension', 'action', 'most', 'entirety', 'surprisingly', 'Will', 'Smith', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'only', 'tackle', 'many', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'two', 'hour', 'run', 'time', 'also', 'do', 'so', 'having', 'much', 'anyone', 'react', 'Spending', 'good', 'hour', 'so', 'single', 'actor', 'Will', 'Smith', 'work', 'was', 'gamble', 'paid', 'off.Your', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'entirely', 'based', 'what', 'bring', 'table', ""'re"", 'coming', 'film', 'expecting', 'see', 'book', 'come', 'life', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'However', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'actually', 'good', 'story', 'human', 'aspect', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'one', 'thrilling', 'recently']",I Am Legend

657468,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B00005JPTK,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[2, 2]","The two disc special edition with the digital copy of ""I Am Legend"" not only has the version seen in theatres but also an alternative ending - one that has a totally different conclusion than the theatrical release. But it too differs from what was written in the Richard Matheson short story of the same name, and it really isn't that much better, so be warned. The bonus features include four animated short films, all related to the movie. The digital copy (on the second disc with the alternate version) allows you to copy the film to your computer taking up less space on your hard drive than if you copied it from the DVD alone - that is, if you like to watch movies on your PC. There are also bonuses you can view BUT you can only access them by inserting the DVD into your computer - you can't do it with just a regular DVD player. Too much of a pain to deal with, IMO. If you can do without all of the extras included here, then I suggest you stick to the single disc version of this film - it's cheaper.As for this latest version of the famous Matheson post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller (there were two previous ones, ""The Last Man On Earth"" {with Vincent Price, 1964} and ""The Omega Man"" {with Charlton Heston, 1971}), it starts off strong, with Will Smith as the lone human survivor on earth of a virus that originally was developed as a cure for cancer, but went terribly awry, killing most of the world's population. Smith in his role as military scientist Robert Neville (who is immune from the virus) is intense, and his only companion is his dog Sam, a loyal german shepherd that he raised from a puppy. Sam is the only link to the lonely Neville's past and his family.For the first hour or so of the movie, you are totally transfixed by Smith's heartfelt solitary performance and the interaction with his canine companion. In this case, the dog is definitely Neville's best friend - and his only friend, as the two of them depend on and protect each other in a desolate world. We see flashbacks of just how Robert Neville ended up in this tragic and unenviable position. Will carries the film surprizingly well on his own, as he attempts to achieve some kind of normalcy by having conversations with his dog and mannequins he set up in a store, pretending that they are living and breathing beings like himself. He and Sam live life from day to day alone - listening to reggae legend Bob Marley's music for inspiration, send out messages with the hope there is someone else out there like them and fight to survive against violent, blood-thirsty vampire-like creatures (courtesy of CGI) that lurk in dark places during the day and roam free at night. These beings were once human, but they were infected by this virus and survived - and this is what they mutated into. Neville works tirelessly to find a cure before it's too late (""I can still fix this!"") so perhaps these creatures can once again become human.The introduction of two other human characters into the story who have traveled to a decimated New York City where Neville is - this is the point where the movie begins to lose steam. This is unfortunate, because the first part of this film really showcases just how exceptionally good Smith has become as an actor. It certainly doesn't hurt that the guy is so appealing and likeable in nearly everything he does. This withstanding, it's the second hour of the movie that falls flat. Even with the action sequences, it doesn't captivate you like the first hour did, where there was relatively little of that. You don't really feel any emotional connection to the woman and the little boy she has with her; I cared more about the fates of Neville and his german shepherd. I found the ending to be a disappointment, and having read the Matheson novel, I felt that if the screenwriters had remained faithful to the ending of the book, it might have had ended better - not happier because it isn't that type of movie - but at least you wouldn't have felt cheated. The film itself, like the two that preceded it, differs greatly from the book, but some of the changes made here worked very well - and some not so well. But ""I Am Legend"" is worth watching, at least for the first hour and to see Will Smith's amazing performance.Rating: 3.5 stars",4,Rating the two disc special edition DVD...and the movie,1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,4268,"['two', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'digital', 'copy', 'Am', 'Legend', 'not', 'only', 'version', 'seen', 'theatres', 'also', 'alternative', 'ending', 'one', 'totally', 'different', 'conclusion', 'theatrical', 'release', 'too', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'short', 'story', 'same', 'name', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'better', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'bonus', 'include', 'four', 'animated', 'short', 'films', 'all', 'related', 'movie', 'digital', 'copy', 'second', 'disc', 'alternate', 'version', 'copy', 'film', 'computer', 'taking', 'up', 'less', 'space', 'hard', 'drive', 'copied', 'DVD', 'alone', 'like', 'watch', 'movies', 'PC', 'are', 'also', 'can', 'view', 'BUT', 'can', 'only', 'access', 'inserting', 'DVD', 'computer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'just', 'regular', 'DVD', 'player', 'Too', 'much', 'pain', 'deal', 'IMO', 'can', 'do', 'extras', 'included', 'here', 'then', 'suggest', 'stick', 'single', 'disc', 'version', 'film', 'cheaper.As', 'latest', 'version', 'famous', 'Matheson', 'post-apocalyptic', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'were', 'two', 'previous', 'ones', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'Vincent', 'Price', '1964', 'Omega', 'Man', 'Charlton', 'Heston', '1971', 'strong', 'Will', 'Smith', 'lone', 'human', 'survivor', 'earth', 'virus', 'originally', 'was', 'developed', 'cure', 'cancer', 'went', 'terribly', 'awry', 'killing', 'most', 'world', 'population', 'Smith', 'role', 'military', 'scientist', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'who', 'immune', 'virus', 'intense', 'only', 'companion', 'dog', 'Sam', 'loyal', 'german', 'shepherd', 'raised', 'puppy', 'Sam', 'only', 'link', 'lonely', 'Neville', 'past', 'family.For', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'movie', 'are', 'totally', 'transfixed', 'Smith', 'heartfelt', 'solitary', 'performance', 'interaction', 'canine', 'companion', 'case', 'dog', 'definitely', 'Neville', 'best', 'friend', 'only', 'friend', 'two', 'depend', 'protect', 'other', 'desolate', 'world', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'just', 'how', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'ended', 'up', 'tragic', 'unenviable', 'position', 'Will', 'film', 'surprizingly', 'well', 'own', 'achieve', 'kind', 'normalcy', 'having', 'conversations', 'dog', 'mannequins', 'set', 'up', 'store', 'pretending', 'are', 'living', 'breathing', 'beings', 'Sam', 'live', 'life', 'day', 'day', 'alone', 'listening', 'reggae', 'legend', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'music', 'inspiration', 'send', 'out', 'messages', 'hope', 'someone', 'else', 'there', 'fight', 'survive', 'violent', 'blood-thirsty', 'vampire-like', 'creatures', 'courtesy', 'CGI', 'lurk', 'dark', 'places', 'day', 'roam', 'free', 'night', 'beings', 'were', 'once', 'human', 'were', 'infected', 'virus', 'survived', 'what', 'mutated', 'Neville', 'tirelessly', 'find', 'cure', 'too', 'late', 'can', 'still', 'fix', 'so', 'perhaps', 'creatures', 'can', 'once', 'again', 'become', 'human.The', 'introduction', 'two', 'other', 'human', 'characters', 'story', 'who', 'have', 'traveled', 'decimated', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'Neville', 'point', 'where', 'movie', 'lose', 'steam', 'unfortunate', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'how', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'Smith', 'become', 'actor', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'guy', 'so', 'appealing', 'likeable', 'nearly', 'everything', 'withstanding', 'second', 'hour', 'movie', 'flat', 'Even', 'action', 'sequences', ""n't"", 'captivate', 'first', 'hour', 'did', 'where', 'was', 'relatively', 'little', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'emotional', 'connection', 'woman', 'little', 'boy', 'cared', 'more', 'fates', 'Neville', 'german', 'shepherd', 'found', 'ending', 'be', 'disappointment', 'having', 'read', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'felt', 'screenwriters', 'had', 'remained', 'faithful', 'ending', 'book', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'ended', 'better', 'not', 'happier', ""n't"", 'type', 'movie', 'least', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'felt', 'cheated', 'film', 'two', 'preceded', 'differs', 'greatly', 'book', 'changes', 'made', 'here', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'Am', 'Legend', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'first', 'hour', 'see', 'Will', 'Smith', 'amazing', 'performance.Rating', '3.5', 'stars']",I Am Legend

657470,A10RYB48HQ46Z6,B00005JPTK,The Helmsman,"[2, 3]","2.5 StarsI went into this movie not knowing what to expect. I'd seen a few commercials, but I didn't have any idea what it was about, and I had no real desire to see it, except that a friend of mine wanted to go, and asked me to come along.I loved the first half-hour or so of this film. Seeing empty, overgrown Manhattan streets is surreal and eerie, even on a clear day with bright sunshine and the occasional bird singing. Anybody who has ever been to New York City should appreciate how wonderfully chilling it feels to hear virtual SILENCE in the city streets. The atmosphere is incredible, the details are amazing (be sure to check out the gas prices; you'll wince), and the whole setting is extremely well done. Enter Will Smith, the last man on Earth... sort of. Manhattan is his playground (and his hunting ground); he has the whole place to himself. And he makes some very interesting use of it. His antics are amusing, and truly fun to watch; even better, it makes you think about what it might really be like to be the last person alive on Earth. And better still, they make some sense (considering that such solitude would make anybody at least a little crazy); they're actually BELIEVABLE. Until the mutant zombie vampire things show up. After that, it's pure cliched horror movie shtick, and that's when the trouble starts.First of all, the CGI mutant zombie vampire things are just BAD. REALLY bad. They don't look real, and they're not scary; we've seen creatures like them done before, and done better. The scares are limited to cheap (and predictable) shock moments where a loud noise makes you jump after a prolonged quiet. But I digress. Even the CGI animals early in the movie are unconvincing, which is a problem in this day and age. Given the budget expended for this film, they definitely could have done better.Second, the final hour or so is riddled with plot holes. The first half of the movie shows that Manhattan is completely cut off from the rest of the world. The bridges have been blown up and the tunnels are flooded. So where do the other uninfected characters come from? How does Will Smith single-handedly fortify his house with steel closures and explosives, and build a fully-stocked medical lab in his basement? Where does he get his electricity from, if everybody else is dead? The film doesn't even attempt to answer these questions; it's probably better for it, given how clumsily the story was handled. Still, the second half does have a few good moments, but they're never put to use. In one scene halfway through the film, something happens that suggests that the mutant zombie vampire things are actually intelligent and crafty, and maybe even organized and social. It would have been a nice twist, but that idea is never capitalized on; it immediately gets thrown by the wayside, and the CGI baddies revert to incessant screaming, rushing at Will Smith in mindless zombie fashion, and performing superhuman feats which are completely unbelievable. They scramble up the facades of buildings like Spiderman, for crying out loud!And lastly, the ending is pure Hollywood. Will Smith goes out with a bang, and conveniently saves the world in the process, and what's left of humanity lives happily ever after, yada yada yada. It's horrible, and even preachy.

657471,AU9ND05L99YSG,B00005JPTK,TheHorrorMovieCritic,"[2, 2]","Rarely do non-franchised Horror Movies get the blockbuster treatment. The onscreen adaptation of Robert Matheson's brilliant novel, I Am Legend, got just that. This is the third time Hollywood has tried to bring the story to the silver screen and the results are pretty good. If you are looking for a faithful recreation of the book, look elsewhere. About the only thing you'll recognize is the character Robert Neville and the fact that he is the last man on Earth. Everything else has been changed or altered.Will Smith brings an interesting take to the character. Neville is now a military scientist hell-bent on figuring out a cure for a virus that has turned humanity into vampyric zombie creatures. Smith grinds out a gritty performance. As pretty much the only actor on-screen he is enthralling to watch. The man has certainly come a long way since his Fresh Prince days. The movie has excellent pacing and keeps you entertained despite the lack of dialogue. Memory induced flashbacks provide viewers with scraps of pre-apocalyptic back-story. I can't stress just how riveting Smith's Neville is to watch. Viewers will also grow fond of his best friend, Sam...a beautiful German Shepard.I am Legend's New York is eerie and unsettling. It is perhaps the most realistic post apocalyptic vision portrayed in a film. Seeing the overgrown ruins of New York City is pretty breathtaking. You really get this sense of dread and loneliness. I must give some kudos for the complete lack of music. This was such a brilliant decision. It goes a long way towards making the setting feel empty. The only music is provided by Neville playing the occasional up lifting tune from Bob Marley.The place where this movie falters big time is with the vampires/creatures. WHY are they all CG!?! You have this surreal, frightening setting for the story to unfold and then you see these laughably bad CG creatures and you hate the movie. Seriously, the effect of these creatures is so jarring to witness that the Genie from Aladdin might as well be trying to scare us.I Am Legend has the blueprint of a smart and well executed horror thriller. It's such a shame that they went with such horrible CG effects for the vampires. If you can get past that piss poor judgment on the filmmakers behalf, then you will find an enjoyable movie experience. Hollywood still hasn't provided us with a faithful version of Matheson's novel...however this one is still worth checking out.Final Grade: B-",3,"Chilling Setting, Laughable CG Creatures...Ugh",1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,2469,"['Rarely', 'do', 'non-franchised', 'Horror', 'Movies', 'get', 'blockbuster', 'treatment', 'onscreen', 'adaptation', 'Robert', 'Matheson', 'brilliant', 'novel', 'Am', 'Legend', 'got', 'just', 'that', 'third', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'tried', 'bring', 'story', 'silver', 'screen', 'results', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'looking', 'faithful', 'recreation', 'book', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'only', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'character', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'fact', 'last', 'man', 'Earth', 'Everything', 'else', 'been', 'changed', 'altered.Will', 'Smith', 'interesting', 'take', 'character', 'Neville', 'now', 'military', 'scientist', 'hell-bent', 'figuring', 'out', 'cure', 'virus', 'turned', 'humanity', 'vampyric', 'zombie', 'creatures', 'Smith', 'out', 'gritty', 'performance', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'actor', 'on-screen', 'enthralling', 'watch', 'man', 'certainly', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'days', 'movie', 'excellent', 'pacing', 'entertained', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'Memory', 'induced', 'flashbacks', 'provide', 'viewers', 'scraps', 'pre-apocalyptic', 'back-story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'just', 'how', 'riveting', 'Smith', 'Neville', 'watch', 'Viewers', 'will', 'also', 'grow', 'fond', 'best', 'friend', 'Sam', 'beautiful', 'German', 'Shepard.I', 'am', 'Legend', 'New', 'York', 'eerie', 'unsettling', 'perhaps', 'most', 'realistic', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'vision', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Seeing', 'overgrown', 'ruins', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'pretty', 'breathtaking', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'dread', 'loneliness', 'must', 'give', 'kudos', 'complete', 'lack', 'music', 'was', 'such', 'brilliant', 'decision', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'setting', 'feel', 'empty', 'only', 'music', 'provided', 'Neville', 'playing', 'occasional', 'up', 'lifting', 'tune', 'Bob', 'Marley.The', 'place', 'where', 'movie', 'big', 'time', 'vampires/creatures', 'WHY', 'are', 'CG', 'have', 'surreal', 'frightening', 'setting', 'story', 'unfold', 'then', 'see', 'laughably', 'bad', 'CG', 'creatures', 'hate', 'movie', 'Seriously', 'effect', 'creatures', 'so', 'jarring', 'witness', 'Genie', 'Aladdin', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'trying', 'scare', 'us.I', 'Am', 'Legend', 'blueprint', 'smart', 'well', 'executed', 'horror', 'thriller', 'such', 'shame', 'went', 'such', 'horrible', 'CG', 'effects', 'vampires', 'can', 'get', 'piss', 'poor', 'judgment', 'filmmakers', 'behalf', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'experience', 'Hollywood', 'still', ""n't"", 'provided', 'faithful', 'version', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'however', 'one', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.Final', 'Grade', 'B-']",I Am Legend
657472,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00005JPTK,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[2, 4]","While this is the fourth time the story for I Am Legend has been adapted for film (first as The Last Man on Earth, second as The Omega Man and third as I Am Omega), the script is unduly similar to countless other horror and sci-fi films of late. Lone survivor Neville faces the monotony of isolation (as seen in Cast Away) and grasps at the hope that he can discover a cure for the virus that has wiped out civilization (as seen in the equally mediocre Resident Evil). The constant ""jump"" scares become predictable and the stodgy creature designs are curiously reminiscent of The Mummy's Imhotep. I Am Legend is unfortunately one of those films that may be entertaining at first glance, but will be quickly forgotten.From the first few minutes of the film it is more than apparent that the last man on earth is not alone. And that's when the suspense hits. The most impressive and annoying aspect of I Am Legend is the wavering suspense turned to constant apprehension. It is not intellectual or psychological suspense like that found in Alfred Hitchcock's legendary works, but mere ""jump scares"" that create shock from the unexpected. Startling the audience with fulminating noises, sudden movements and creatures lashing out at the screen, this is clearly the poor man's replacement for genuine scares. The constant fright builds plenty of anticipation, but due to the regular intervals of scream-inducing moments, it becomes rather predictable as the movie progresses.A lot has been left to the imagination, especially during the adaptation of the novel, of which the film deviates so greatly that taking its title was far from necessary. The post virus break out is narrated through dream sequences and flashbacks to explain why Neville is alone in New York. While much of the deterioration of humans into vampiric zombies is not covered, the reverse effect, in which the creatures begin to grow smarter and appear to follow a leader, is completely untouched by explanation. In fact, the last we hear of Neville's experiments is that they have de-evolved into the most primitive of life forms - and the very next second they are plotting intricate traps and training zombie dogs to attack.In an attempt to demonstrate Neville's loneliness as the last man on earth, he sets up mannequins in the neighboring video rental store to simulate interactivity with humans. It is a relatively successful demonstration of the mental instabilities he suffers due to extreme isolation, but even at its finest, when he finally confronts a female mannequin that he continually jokes with his dog about approaching, it feels like an inferior version of Cast Away. At the same time, a single shot of one of the mannequins seemingly turning its head as Neville passes by, is the highlight of the horror creepiness, which is perhaps the only real psychological scare.I Am Legend remains entertaining throughout (mostly due to Smith's onscreen charisma and the incessant jump scares) but ultimately offers nothing new to the genre. Straying far from the novel's more thought-provoking storyline, (involving multiple factions of human digression and vampire tendencies), this Legend never really breaches the sci-fi horror category and often feels all too familiar for those keeping up on their sci-fi/horror films. Superb action sequences help and poor creature designs certainly don't, but enough entertainment can be had that Smith's latest work is worth a look for those interested in the genre; just don't expect anything too legendary.- The Massie Twins",3,I Am Legend Movie Review,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,3542,"['fourth', 'time', 'story', 'Am', 'Legend', 'been', 'adapted', 'film', 'first', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'second', 'Omega', 'Man', 'third', 'Am', 'Omega', 'script', 'unduly', 'similar', 'countless', 'other', 'horror', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'late', 'Lone', 'survivor', 'Neville', 'monotony', 'isolation', 'seen', 'Cast', 'Away', 'grasps', 'hope', 'can', 'discover', 'cure', 'virus', 'wiped', 'out', 'civilization', 'seen', 'equally', 'mediocre', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'constant', 'jump', 'become', 'predictable', 'stodgy', 'creature', 'designs', 'are', 'curiously', 'reminiscent', 'Mummy', 'Imhotep', 'Am', 'Legend', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'films', 'may', 'be', 'entertaining', 'first', 'glance', 'will', 'be', 'quickly', 'forgotten.From', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'more', 'apparent', 'last', 'man', 'earth', 'not', 'alone', 'when', 'suspense', 'most', 'impressive', 'annoying', 'aspect', 'Am', 'Legend', 'wavering', 'suspense', 'turned', 'constant', 'apprehension', 'not', 'intellectual', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'found', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'legendary', 'works', 'mere', 'jump', 'scares', 'create', 'shock', 'unexpected', 'Startling', 'audience', 'fulminating', 'noises', 'sudden', 'movements', 'creatures', 'lashing', 'out', 'screen', 'clearly', 'poor', 'man', 'replacement', 'genuine', 'scares', 'constant', 'fright', 'builds', 'plenty', 'anticipation', 'due', 'regular', 'intervals', 'scream-inducing', 'moments', 'rather', 'predictable', 'movie', 'progresses.A', 'lot', 'been', 'left', 'imagination', 'especially', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'film', 'so', 'greatly', 'taking', 'title', 'was', 'far', 'necessary', 'post', 'virus', 'break', 'out', 'narrated', 'dream', 'sequences', 'flashbacks', 'explain', 'why', 'Neville', 'alone', 'New', 'York', 'much', 'deterioration', 'humans', 'vampiric', 'zombies', 'not', 'covered', 'reverse', 'effect', 'creatures', 'begin', 'grow', 'smarter', 'appear', 'follow', 'leader', 'completely', 'untouched', 'explanation', 'fact', 'last', 'hear', 'Neville', 'experiments', 'have', 'de-evolved', 'most', 'primitive', 'life', 'forms', 'very', 'next', 'second', 'are', 'plotting', 'intricate', 'traps', 'training', 'zombie', 'dogs', 'attack.In', 'attempt', 'demonstrate', 'Neville', 'loneliness', 'last', 'man', 'earth', 'up', 'mannequins', 'neighboring', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'simulate', 'interactivity', 'humans', 'relatively', 'successful', 'demonstration', 'mental', 'instabilities', 'due', 'extreme', 'isolation', 'even', 'finest', 'when', 'finally', 'female', 'mannequin', 'continually', 'dog', 'approaching', 'inferior', 'version', 'Cast', 'Away', 'same', 'time', 'single', 'shot', 'one', 'mannequins', 'seemingly', 'turning', 'head', 'Neville', 'passes', 'highlight', 'horror', 'creepiness', 'perhaps', 'only', 'real', 'psychological', 'scare.I', 'Am', 'Legend', 'entertaining', 'mostly', 'due', 'Smith', 'onscreen', 'charisma', 'incessant', 'jump', 'scares', 'ultimately', 'offers', 'nothing', 'new', 'genre', 'Straying', 'far', 'novel', 'more', 'thought-provoking', 'storyline', 'involving', 'multiple', 'factions', 'human', 'digression', 'vampire', 'tendencies', 'Legend', 'never', 'really', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'category', 'often', 'too', 'familiar', 'keeping', 'up', 'sci-fi/horror', 'films', 'Superb', 'action', 'sequences', 'help', 'poor', 'creature', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'enough', 'entertainment', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'Smith', 'latest', 'work', 'look', 'interested', 'genre', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'too', 'legendary.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",I Am Legend

I saw the cult favorite THE OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston years and years ago but I think I'll read the book and then watch that one again.  And maybe this one again.This third version, thankfully keeping Matheson's great title, is well-made and entertaining but I thought the first half was stronger than the second half.  I liked Will Smith in I, ROBOT and he does a great job here as well, playing a dogged scientist hunting in an eerily empty New York City by day and searching for a cure to the plague virus by night.  (Years ago it had been announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger would play in this--imagine Dr. Arnold as a gov't scientist!)The zombie/vampires were creepy enough but they were obviously computer generated.  I wished there had been more personality given to them and more personal conflict between Smith and the monsters (a relationship between the lead monster and a female monster Smith abducts to experiment on is hinted at but never developed any further).Still, some great shots of NYC standing empty, overrun by weeds and deer.(Now I'll have to read the novel.

657474,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00005JPTK,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[12, 14]","Richard Matheson's novel ""I Am Legend"" has been made into at least three motion pictures -- ""The Last Man on Earth"" (Vincent Price), ""The Omega Man"" (Charlton Heston), and ""I Am Legend"" (Will Smith) -- and has served as inspiration for dozens of others.  The story combines science fiction and horror in a bleak, pessimistic view of the future of mankind.In the latest version, ""I Am Legend,"" Smith stars as Robert Neville, a scientist who was unable to halt the spread of an incurable, man-made virus.  Immune to the fatal virus, Neville is the sole human survivor in what remains of New York City and possibly the world.  His only companion is his dog, Samantha.  But mutant plague victims -- the Infected -- lurk in the darkness, watching Neville's every move and waiting for him to make a fatal mistake.  Day to day, Neville is driven by a single mission:  to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus.  To do so, he must use his own immune blood.""I Am Legend"" is by far the most ambitious of the three screen adaptations of Matheson's novel.  The opening scenes, showing a deserted Times Square overgrown with vegetation, are spectacular, and Smith manages to keep the story flowing in the early scenes even though he's the only person we see.  Flashbacks illustrate the stages leading up to the present near-obliteration of humanity and are elaborately staged by director Francis Lawrence.  The film's third act resorts to a fairly routine formula of the hero versus the monsters but, overall, ""I Am Legend"" is an impressive effort.The ""I Am Legend Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is just the thing for sci-fi and Will Smith fans.  The three-disc box set contains two versions of the movie, one with a controversial ending; a digital copy of the film; four animated comics; 12 never-before-seen deleted scenes along with filmmaker's commentary; a 44-page concept sketch book; a lucite commemorative piece featuring images from the movie; and hours of featurettes covering filming on the aircraft carrier Intrepid, canine training, making New York City look deserted, assistance provided by the U.S. Military, and the integration of CGI images with live action footage.",4,Cool Sci-Fi Thriller,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,2177,"['Richard', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'Am', 'Legend', 'been', 'made', 'least', 'three', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Omega', 'Man', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Will', 'Smith', 'served', 'inspiration', 'dozens', 'others', 'story', 'combines', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'bleak', 'pessimistic', 'view', 'future', 'mankind.In', 'latest', 'version', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Smith', 'stars', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'scientist', 'who', 'was', 'unable', 'halt', 'spread', 'incurable', 'man-made', 'virus', 'Immune', 'fatal', 'virus', 'Neville', 'sole', 'human', 'survivor', 'what', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'possibly', 'world', 'only', 'companion', 'dog', 'Samantha', 'mutant', 'plague', 'victims', 'Infected', 'lurk', 'darkness', 'watching', 'Neville', 'move', 'waiting', 'make', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'Day', 'day', 'Neville', 'driven', 'single', 'mission', 'find', 'way', 'reverse', 'effects', 'virus', 'do', 'so', 'must', 'use', 'own', 'immune', 'blood', 'Am', 'Legend', 'far', 'most', 'ambitious', 'three', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'opening', 'scenes', 'showing', 'deserted', 'Times', 'Square', 'vegetation', 'are', 'spectacular', 'Smith', 'manages', 'keep', 'story', 'flowing', 'early', 'scenes', 'even', 'only', 'person', 'see', 'Flashbacks', 'illustrate', 'stages', 'leading', 'up', 'present', 'near-obliteration', 'humanity', 'are', 'elaborately', 'staged', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'film', 'third', 'act', 'resorts', 'fairly', 'routine', 'formula', 'hero', 'monsters', 'overall', 'Am', 'Legend', 'impressive', 'effort.The', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Ultimate', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'just', 'thing', 'sci-fi', 'Will', 'Smith', 'fans', 'three-disc', 'box', 'set', 'contains', 'two', 'versions', 'movie', 'one', 'controversial', 'ending', 'digital', 'copy', 'film', 'four', 'animated', 'comics', '12', 'never-before-seen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'filmmaker', 'commentary', '44-page', 'concept', 'sketch', 'book', 'lucite', 'commemorative', 'piece', 'featuring', 'images', 'movie', 'hours', 'featurettes', 'covering', 'filming', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'Intrepid', 'canine', 'training', 'making', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'look', 'deserted', 'assistance', 'provided', 'U.S.', 'Military', 'integration', 'CGI', 'images', 'live', 'action', 'footage']",I Am Legend

There was no reason behind having Smith have to Kill his only companion....served no purpose other then to make it depressing as well as boring and had they kept the dog alive, perhaps his antics could have gotten this to maybe 2 or 3 stars as there would have been many areas they could have used the dog...Oh well.....very disappointed in this one.....",1,BLA!,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,1232,"['love', 'Will', 'Smith', 'trailors', ""'plot/themes"", 'sounded', 'would', 'be', 'GREAT', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Smith', 'A', 'acting', 'have', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'slow', 'plodding', 'movie.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'was', 'just', 'horrible', 'long', 'only', '1hr', '40min', 'seemed', 'many', 'more', 'plodding', 'film', 'went', 'nowhere.And', 'boot', 'have', 'kill', 'dog', 'middle', 'film', 'making', 'depressing', 'as', 'well', 'boring', 'liked', 'original', 'ending', 'far', 'better', 'then', 'alternate', 'one', 'endings', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'trying', 'make', 'something', 'boring', 'predictable', 'nothing', 'movie.Could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'one', 'Smith', 'very', 'interesting', 'premise', 'Movie', 'yet', 'turned', 'dud', ""'Watch"", 'Once', 'Never', 'Again', 'bin.I', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'zero', 'stars', 'sole', 'reason', 'killed', 'dog', 'was', 'reason', 'having', 'Smith', 'have', 'Kill', 'only', 'companion', '.served', 'purpose', 'other', 'then', 'make', 'depressing', 'as', 'well', 'boring', 'had', 'kept', 'dog', 'alive', 'perhaps', 'antics', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'maybe', '2', '3', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'areas', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'dog', 'Oh', 'well', '..very', 'disappointed', 'one', '..']",I Am Legend

657478,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPTK,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 1]","""I am Legend"", the third film based on the book by writer Richard Matheson, stars Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville. ""Legend"" is a surprisingly good film despite a spectacularly weak ending and easily the best of the three film adaptations.Dr. Robert Neville, an army scientist, is the leading researcher looking for a cure to a virus. The virus once promised to cure cancer, but has ended up killing a large percentage of the population, leaving Robert alone in a virtually deserted New York City. He spends his days exercising with his dog, doing research to try to find a cure and trying to stay alive. I say virtually deserted New York City because at night, he has to barricade himself in his home, ready to fight off the zombie like creatures who come out at night. Portions of the people not killed by the virus have become creatures who hunt at night, feeding on the remaining humans. This situation has also helped to wipe out part of the survivors and made the creatures smarter and more resourceful- as their food supply dwindles, they figure out how to find food, becoming more ruthless, more determined, scarier. Robert knows about these creatures and is determined to protect is anonymity. One day, his dog chases an antelope into a dark building and he runs across a coven of these creatures. Determined to continue his research, he captures one and takes her back to his lab. But nothing seems to work. He continues to send out messages on a radio band and to do his research. But things will change soon, and drastically.Entertainment Weekly recently listed Smith as one of ""The 50 Smartest People in Hollywood"". I'm not trying to validate this magazine filler, but they have a point. With remarkably rare exception, Smith has made remarkably well-received films serving to cement his place in the top echelon of actors who command top dollar for their films. Even when the films aren't great, they are fun. So we can possibly forgive him ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and ""Wild Wild West"" because he has given us such hits as the phenomenally successful ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"" and ""Bad Boys"". ""I am Legend,"" continues this trend, providing Smith with a star vehicle in which is he is virtually the only person on screen for a majority of the film. Because the film has made a lot of money, Smith will receive most of the credit for the film's success.After the virus eradicates much of the world's human population, Robert, somehow immune, continues his research, working very hard to make sure his home remains a safe haven. He checks to almanac to make sure he and Sam, his daughter's dog, return home every day before sunset. He lowers shutters and barricades the door and sleeps in the bathtub, with the dog and a rifle at his side. To maintain his sanity, he watches videotapes of old television and pretends mannequins in a shop are real people, having conversations with them.Because there are no people in New York City, the animals run wild and Robert and Sam are always on the hunt for new game, to supplement their diet. They chase a deer and Sam runs after the deer into a dark building. Robert is reluctant to follow her, but he can't leave his pet, his only daily contact, and his only tie to the past, to fall into the hands of the creatures that take over the night. Sure enough, they run into a group of them and Robert has to try to make it out. Somehow.But Robert is also a scientist, so he returns to set a trap and capture one of them, to run some more experiments. Much like Sam running into the darkened building, the leader of the creatures tries to prevent one of his less intelligent followers from falling into the trap, but is unable to stop her in time.""I Am Legend"" is very good. And it is so good because it convincingly sets up Robert's environment. I still can't figure out how they recreated the vacant, overgrown, slightly battered New York City. Robert races his car through empty streets, overgrown with weeds and littered with rusting cars. The filmmakers spent a lot of time and money on the special effects to recreate this. A shot of the bridges leading into Manhattan, both of which were hit by missiles many years ago, is particularly stunning.Smith is virtually the only person on screen for 80% of the film. Can there be any further definition of a star `carrying a film'? Also, because of the leading man's inherent charisma and charm, he commands our attention on the screen and makes us believe he is a scientist capable of finding a cure to a virus that has wiped out 90% of the world's population. How refreshing and different from other actors who pop up and try to portray nuclear scientists or heart surgeons and barely look like they can apply their lipstick or shave.As Smith's Robert Neville moves through his world, a world we are just learning about, he is almost a tour guide for us, introducing us to the various modifications he has made in order to survive. This is a testament to Smith's skill because we never feel as though he is trying to teach us, as though he is on a pulpit explaining things to us. We learn through his actions, his observances, by watching him as he deals with the routine he has set up.Director Francis Lawrence (""Constantine"") paces the film well, catching our attention with an action packed sequence. He fills in the details later. After a brief prologue, we are immediately plunged into Robert's world and watch as he and Sam hunt wild animals. As the film progresses, Robert remembers key events leading to the evacuation of New York, which he refers to as ""Ground Zero"" for the virus on more than one occasion. These scenes also give us a look at what happened to his wife and child, giving us more details about how Robert is willing and able to cope with this strange situation.Because we are immediately thrust into this man's current situation, we get a real sense of what he has been living through. This is the majority of his life now, everything else, as important as it was, is now secondary. The filmmakers have placed the emphasis in the right place and make the story all the more engrossing and exciting.There are a couple of enigmatic moments my friends and I have been talking about, because they could mean a couple of different things. Not because they are confusing or uninteresting. These discussions have led all people to have further consideration for each side of the argument. How often do you come out of an action / sci-fi film talking about things, trying to figure them out, having discussions?For all of the work spent on creating a post-apocalyptic New York, some of the CGI character work is less than perfect. The creatures are interesting and ""Alpha Male"", as he is listed in IMDB, the leader of these vampire - zombie creatures does seem to have some intelligence, some capability to lead the rest of his coven. But some of these creatures are less convincing than others. Late in the film, the Alpha Male unleashes some of his infected dogs and they are particularly fake looking. So, the CGI is not consistent throughout.And the film begins to fall apart in the last act, leading us to a particularly weak ending. When the DVD is released, you could have a double bill featuring ""I am Legend"" and ""The Village"" and it might seem like one seamless film.But these complaints aside, ""I am Legend"" is still an extremely strong film and worthy of your money.",4,Smith Carries the Film and the Burden Overpowers the Final Act,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,7409,"['am', 'Legend', 'third', 'film', 'based', 'book',

657479,A27FYYS44LH7KD,B00005JPTK,Thucydides 1,"[2, 2]","-- No spoilers --Will Smith surely gave this movie his ALL, and that's saying quite a lot. It takes a lot of courage and ability for one actor to carry a movie like this, yet he does it with ease. The earlier parts of the movie with he and his dog, Sam, are engaging and absorbing.  And these, merged with the flashback motif to bring the viewer into an understanding of what had happened in the past, up to the present moment of the movie work very well, indeed.It's the rest of it that just didn't work for me. And that comprised an inertia of poor movie-making that not even Will Smith could overcome.When we saw creatures like this in ""The Mummy"" (the Brendan Fraser versions), they worked in a fantasy way, but in that surreal/comical atmosphere, they fit in and ""made sense"". In ""I Am Legend"" they do not.Can you think of anything about a lethal, debilitating virus that would give anyone unbelievable, superhuman speed and strength?  Can you imagine humans rendered so demented by a disease that although able to set subtle traps to catch prey, they'd hurl themselves heedlessly into objects that would rip themselves to pieces?Again and again I kept saying, ""This just doesn't make any sense!""And then you meet the immune ""survivors"" and the story progresses down an even more unbelievable line.  By the end of the movie you can't help but think, ""What a waste of Will Smith.""Can Will Smith carry a movie almost entirely by himself? You bet he can! And he does a better job of it than anyone else I can think of. Had this movie not had Will Smith, and Sam the dog, it would have been unendurable. But because of them and Will's enormous talent, it rose from two-stars to three, in my opinion.

657480,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00005JPTK,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[0, 0]","Interesting mostly for the haunting view of an abandoned New York City, ""I Am Legend"" follows Will Smith as he tries to redeem himself for his part in unleashing a devastating plague on the world. For the first 2/3'rds of the movie, it's very affecting. Dr Neville (Smith) and dog Sam prowl an abandoned Manhattan, sharing the space with deer, lions and other critters.It's those other critters that amp up the middle of the movie, as Smith does a major boo-boo and grabs a female zombie-mutant plague victim who happens to be best gal pal to the alpha zombie. Seems Dr Neville needs to run tests on muties if he will find a cure and save mankind, yet for some romantic reason, alpha zombie wants his baby back. This conflict made for the best part of ""I Am Legend,"" but the film did not have the good sense to leave it at that. After three years alone with the dark-seekers, another pair of real live humans make it to NYC, and then the film stumbles.I won't go beyond this point, because all other plotlines follow from that moment. What was a strong lead character to this point suddenly gets muddled up, and all the cool CGI in the world can't make drama from stale pudding. However, for the scenes of Smith grooving on Bob Marley and the meditation on ""Shrek,"" this is a pretty good mid-level Science Fiction movie.

A pair of geeks, I found that we had to stop the movie periodically to explain some of the points my son questioned (like why Smith's character was broadcasting in AM instead of FM.)After the first 1/3rd of the movie, I thought this movie began to have potential to stand as a metaphor for feelings of isolation in today's society. (Gimme a break. I coach/counsel a lot of powerful, isolated men.)Sadly, in a Hollywood way, the movie started to go downhill after the 1st third. Some points that jumped out include:1. Smith's character is a military man who can bobby-trap an entire city block, but is unable to spot (and avoid) a simplistic guerilla trap. (Note to the colonel: ""Who do you THINK moved Frank the dummy? The deer?!?)2.He's been alone for 3 years and convinced that he's the last person on earth. A beautiful woman comes and literally saves him from death ... and he can barely have a civil conversation with her?3. How did the baddies get into his house at the end? It seemed like Smith's character left a window open in his daughter's room. Again, after locking down the house for 3 years (and it being a matter of life/death), he's gonna forget to close a window?4. Smith's character has the ability to design and construct heavy steel shutters over his house windows, and then builds a laboratory door out of .... what? It looked like cardboard the way those baddies blasted through it.I'm willing to suspend some disbelief when I watch movies, but the ending of this movie had too many holes in it.

657484,A1NAG22PRBD5Y9,B00005JPTK,"Todd, fiction junkie","[0, 1]","I know we're conditioned by the most action movies to expect a never-ending sequence of fights, explosions, and chase scenes.  This movie has few of these.  In fact, Will Smith's character is essentially alone (well, along with his German Shepherd) in a post-apocalyptic NYC wiped out by a mutating virus.  You might think this would make for a boring movie.  Some have found this movie to be that, but I did not.  The silent, self-reflective stretches of this movie give Dr. Neville (Will Smith's character) time to think, and we have time for that as well.  This makes for a richer experience, and makes me wonder if I've missed important thoughts or details in more action-packed movies, as I was carried along willy-nilly by the plot.  Obviously Will Smith's acting makes or breaks this movie; many could not carry a movie single-handedly the way this one requires.What I liked:  Will Smith strikes just the right balance between courage in the face of danger, and self-deprecating humor.  You would have to be comfortable in your own skin if you were, literally, the last man on earth.  The CG images of a NYC destroyed and overgrown by decay were mesmerizing and realistic.  I also liked the many small details of what he would have needed to do to survive.  Yes, fight the zombies; but you've also got to eat, and take care of your stuff.  Suspense of battling the inhuman night-creatures was riveting.  Some did not like the ending (no spoilers) but I was fine with it.What I didn't like:  In some ways not faithful to the book; but this was not a huge issue for me.  Others have felt that the plot got bogged down or derailed at times.  And extroverts would be disconcerted, and perhaps even bored, by the solitude of it all.  Most of the main character's witty dialog was with himself or his dog; not everone's kind of sci-fi movie.It's true that it was not what many of us have been conditioned to expect from the Hollywood movie assembly line.

657491,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B00005JPTK,trashcanman,"[342, 388]","""I Am Legend"" is not a film that sticks closely to it's source material.  While that is it's biggest flaw, it is also where it shines.  If you ha told me two years ago that I'd get misty-eyed watching Will Smith sing ""Three Little Birds"" in a big budget motion picture I'd have laughed myself silly, but this adaptation of Richard Mathson's untouchable novel that -while itself being a vampire story- inspired the entire zombie film genre as we know it takes the story we all know whether we've read the book or not and turns it into an exceptionally personal affair for all of us.  One man.  One dog.  A familiar metropolis deserted by day, but crawling with death by nightfall.  This is our setting and it's one that never gets old for me.The plague that wipes out Robert Neville's world is never fully explained, simply inferred to be the result of some sort of failed cure for cancer.  Gone from the novel and the original Vincent Price classic,The Last Man on Earth, is the long struggle of Neville to save his ill daughter, his wife's tranformation, and the shocking actions of the US government to contain the plague.  What it left is simply one man, alone trying to maintain his sanity and hopelessly searching for a cure to a disease that has already wiped humanity off the face of the earth and left the ""survivors"" as rabid vampiric horrors.  It's sad, it's pathetic, and it's perfectly human.  Will Smith has a penchant for picking terrible, schmaltzy films to star in, but no one can deny his talent and charisma as a leading man.  Naturally, this is a film he must carry single-handedly and he does an awesome job of it; he's dramatic, he's relateable, and at times, he is funny.  The humor is that of the dark and inappropriate kind, but in a world like his, that is all there is left.The vampires/zombies/infected in this are all CG and more than a bit reminiscent of Gollum fromThe Lord of the Rings. I'm not a fan of these kind of effects when practical would have been more effective and was acutely aware of the fact that I watching computer-generated monsters, but they worked nonetheless.  The infected prove to be terrifying foes for Neville to face, combining suprising cunning, inhuman strength, and impossible agility (hence the CG).  Their only weakness is that sunlight kills them almost instantly.  Neville plays a game of cat-and-mouse with them, gathering supplies, researching  cure, and searching for survivors by day while making sure to get back to his fortified apartment before nightfall when the creatures come out to hunt for his hiding place.  More than a few shades of28 Days Laterare present in this film, which is funny considering the book and it's film offspring are largely what provided the elements of that film.  So I guess the genre has officially come full circle now.Ultimately, it's the personal touches that make ""I Am Legend"" such a treat.  Bob Marley provides both the soundtrack to Robert Neville's day and the inspiration for his work, which is both ironic and uplifting at times.  This may sound strange for a horror flick, but if you are a fan of Marley (himself aLegend) it makes all the sense in the world as you watch.  Watching Neville attempt to interact with mannequins he's set up as he returns the movies he rents (in alphabetical order, one at a time) and seeing him snap when one of the figures is moved is both amusing and, at times, intensely disturbing.  When relief finally comes, Neville finds he has lost the ability to interact with other humans at all and is relegated to performing lines from ""Shrek"", which is playing on his television at the time.  The ending is a complete 180 from the book which is disappointing, but not as corny as it could have been.  The novelI Am Legendhas one of the most brilliant and darkly ironic endings ever put on paper, but director  Francis Lawrence didn't ruin it by go for the happy ending either.  The result is a compromise between the pitch blackness of the book and the cloying cheese that many Will Smith fans love.  It turns out a bittersweet and hopeful conclsion that should satisfy both while not thrilling either.  But I left the theater with ""Redemption Song"" still ringing in my ears and a satisfied feeling.  If only every movie could do that for me.""I Am Legend"" fails to adapt the book of the same name to the big screen, but succeeds in so many other ways.  I can't give it a perfect score, but I will give it a very hearty recommendation to fans of Will Smith, zombies, vampires, and Bob Marley.

657492,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JPTK,trebe,"[0, 0]","Writer Richard Matheson is probably best known for his contributions in the science fiction and fantasy genres.  Among his works made into films are, Somewhere In Time, What Dreams May Come, and Duel, which featured Dennis Weaver pursued by a mad truck driver.  His story I Am Legend, is perhaps his most influential work.  The story is about a nightmare world, where save for one man, the human race have become vampire like creatures.  The first adaptation of Matheson's novel wasLast Man on Earth(1964) starring Vincent Price, followed byThe Omega Man [Blu-ray](1971) starring Charlton Heston.  Another remake was the subject of speculation for some time, before finally becoming a reality with Will Smith in the lead role.(Spoilers ahead, so proceed as you will)Directed by Francis Laurence, I Am Legend (2007) is set in New York in 2012, where a drug intended to cure cancer has mutated, and instead killed most of mankind.  The survivors have become ""darkseekers"", vicious zombielike creatures, with skin sensitive to UV light.  They dwell in the shadows by day, and run wild at night.  Robert Neville (Smith) a virologist, together with his German Sheppard Sam, have the run of Manhattan, and spends their days performing routine tasks, and hanging out at the South Street Seaport, hoping to find other survivors.  Neville retreats to his home before sunset, to keep his location a secret from the darkseekers.  There in his basement laboratory, he performs research hoping to find a cure for the mutated virus.  How Neville's family is killed in an accident is told in flashbacks, but how things got so out of control, isn't really addressed.The empty cityscape is in the early stages of decay.  Almost immediately, the atmosphere of emptiness is established, along with the special relationship between Neville and his loyal companion.  They work as a team, sharing a strange life of solitude.  Exploring this relationship, one of the film's best moments comes early on, when Sam runs into a dark abandoned building while chasing a deer, and Neville enters to try and find him.  Here we glimpse the darkseekers for the first time, and witness their brutal strength.Needing a subject to test a potential cure, Neville utilizes a falling car in a trap that captures a female darkseeker (who appears to have had breast enhancement?).  Observing her capture, a male darkseeker (Dash Mihok) becomes so agitated that he risks death trying to reach Neville.  In several ways, this incident is a pivotal turning point.Solitude has taken a toll on Neville, affecting his behavior and sanity.  He drives madly through the streets in pursuit of running deer.  At a video store he speaks to mannequins that are setup in the store.  Later, when cruising the streets, he sees a mannequin standing in the street.  He stops his car, and belligerently yells at the dummy, then shoots it up.  He is then literally hoisted on his own petard, when he is caught in a trap, that utilizes a falling car.  This misfortune leads to a soul crushing loss that changes his world, and pushes Neville toward suicidal acts.The film's third act is very problematic, as it concludes in two radically different ways.  About to become a victim of the darkseekers, Neville is miraculously rescued by a woman named Anna (Alice Braga), who is accompanied by Ethan (Charlie Tahan), a young boy.  They escape in Anna's vehicle, but unfortunately are followed by the darkseekers back to Neville's home.  Anna says she is on her way North to find a group of survivors.The following night, the darkseekers mount a massive full scale attack.  Neville has some elaborate defense measures in place, but the opposing force is overwhelming.  For being so prepared, Neville strangely has no backdoor escape route out of his home.  In one version Neville sacrifices his life, to provide an opportunity for Anna to escape with a possible cure.  In an alternate version, the captured female darkseeker is returned to her clan, and Neville is spared.  Later Neville, Anna, and Ethan head out of the city, hoping to find other survivors.  Version one is featured on the single disc release, while the second version is included in the two disc and blu ray editions.  Presenting a fatalistic vision devoid of hope, would probably have been box office poison, so it is understandable that the second more optimistic ending was chosen.The computer generated darkseekers look fake, moving like super powered robots.  There is a social structure with some kind of leadership, however what it may be is not clear.  The leader may the same character, but who can really tell?  Neville's attempt to reason with them when trapped in his lab, is curious.This updated take has some good points, with the special effects a major contributor to the film's look.  As little time is given to Neville's family life, the darkseekers, or Anna and Ethan, it is his relationship with Sam makes the strongest impression.  When this ends, largely due to Neville's mistakes, it rips a big chunk out of the heart of the film.  Facing death, Neville is literally dragging his ass, when he should be making tracks, wounded or not.  Sadly, it is Sam who pays for his errors.The void is quickly filled with the introduction of Anna and Ethan, but they are strangers who the audience has nothing invested in.  The battle on the dock is contrived and fake, as is the subsequent way over the top mass attack.  Tack on the dual ending, and you have a third act that derails what was a pretty decent story.  I Am Legend is still worth seeing, preferably in formats with the alternate ending.",3,"loses focus, and stumbles and falls in the home stretch . . .",1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,5613,"['Writer',

657496,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPTK,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Will Smith is the last man on the Earth. Or is he? You will know the answer in the third (English-speaking feature-length) adaptation of Richard Matheson's famous and influential novella, where Smith's protagonist Robert Neville lives alone in New York City with his faithful dog Sam.When I say alone, he is really alone in Manhattan. The film's first 40 minutes is the greatest part of it where Robert Neville can be seen driving a car wildly in the desert streets of New York City, hunting a herd of wild deer by day, and hiding in a bathroom with his dog by night, hearing weird noises from outside. Obviously he is trying to keep his sanity among the remnants of the civilization that is going to end. Director Francis Lawrence has a clear vision as to how the world would end, not with a bang but with a whimper.Unfortunately, ""I Am Legend,"" some might say, really ends with a whimper. I am saying that it does not have actions - it has - but it is exactly the actions that might be a bit disappointing. They involve shootings, explosions and CGIs, but the film could have taken another approach. (And the new film changed the meaning of the title's ""Legend."") Not that I didn't enjoy watching them, though.The film's location is, as I said, New York City while Matheson's original was set in LA. The change is a good idea as NYC has more recognizable landmarks which the film uses quite effectively during the flashback scenes. Also effective is Will Smith's acting as military scientist Robert Neville (formerly played by Vincent Price and Charlton Heston). His excellent acting makes up for the loss of the apocalyptic story's social undertone represented by ""Dark Seekers.""Uncredited Emma Thompson appears briefly in the film's opening sequence, so don't be late for the show.",4,"(3.5 STARS) Great Opening, Great Acting, But the Ending Is ...",1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,1785,"['Will', 'Smith', 'last', 'man', 'Earth', 'will', 'know', 'answer', 'third', 'English-speaking', 'feature-length', 'adaptation', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'famous', 'influential', 'novella', 'where', 'Smith', 'protagonist', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'alone', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'faithful', 'dog', 'Sam.When', 'say', 'alone', 'really', 'alone', 'Manhattan', 'film', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'greatest', 'part', 'where', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'driving', 'car', 'wildly', 'desert', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'hunting', 'herd', 'wild', 'deer', 'day', 'hiding', 'bathroom', 'dog', 'night', 'hearing', 'weird', 'noises', 'outside', 'Obviously', 'trying', 'keep', 'sanity', 'remnants', 'civilization', 'going', 'end', 'Director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'clear', 'vision', 'how', 'world', 'would', 'end', 'not', 'bang', 'whimper.Unfortunately', 'Am', 'Legend', 'might', 'say', 'really', 'whimper', 'am', 'saying', 'not', 'have', 'actions', 'exactly', 'actions', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'involve', 'shootings', 'explosions', 'CGIs', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'approach', 'new', 'film', 'changed', 'meaning', 'title', 'Legend', 'Not', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'film', 'location', 'said', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Matheson', 'original', 'was', 'set', 'LA', 'change', 'good', 'idea', 'NYC', 'more', 'recognizable', 'landmarks', 'film', 'quite', 'effectively', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'Also', 'effective', 'Will', 'Smith', 'acting', 'military', 'scientist', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'formerly', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'excellent', 'acting', 'up', 'loss', 'apocalyptic', 'story', 'social', 'undertone', 'represented', 'Dark', 'Seekers', 'Uncredited', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'briefly', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'late', 'show']",I Am Legend

Years earlier a cure for cancer was developed by changing the structure of a virus.  The cure was heralded throughout the world until the virus begins to mutate and begins a plague. New York City is quarantined, but Neville stays behind in an attempt to find a cure.  Years later, except for his faithful dog, he is still alone.  He spends his days hunting for survivors, gathering supplies, and trying to find a cure.  But that's only during the day.  Before evening, he returns to his home and barricades himself in for the night.  For at night, the people that have been infected by the plague and are still alive come out of hiding, seeking for flesh to eat and blood to drink.  These mutated zombie-vampires are hungry and not only want to find Neville to eat him, but to seek vengeance for what they have become.  As the movie unfolds, it becomes a cat and mouse race as Neville attempts to outwit the creatures and find a cure before they find his home and destroy humanity's only hope.I AM LEGEND is loosely based upon the classic vampire short story of the same name by Richard Matheson.  Other than the main character's name and the general exposition of the plot, I AM LEGEND is unlike the original story.  Fans of the story (myself included) might be disappointed by the adaptation.  Yet, despite straying from the source material, I AM LEGEND works really well as movie in its own right.  The ending of the film does seem rushed and is very different from the ending of the story, yet the overall spirit of the book is intact and the ending of the film makes it clear that Robert Neville is a hero to be admired, a legend.I enjoyed I AM LEGEND.  Will Smith is a very talented actor and I usually enjoy watching him on screen.  I really liked Richard Matheson's original story, and though I was disappointed by certain aspects of the book's latest adaptation, I thought the filmmakers did a great job in making a good and solid movie that stays true to the spirit of the original story.

657502,A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7,B00005JPTK,Unlucky Frank,"[1, 2]","While watching this horrible retelling of Matheson's brilliant I AM LEGEND, I was struck by the frightening similarity between the exaggerated facial characteristics of the rabid infectoids of this flick and those rebellious androids of I ROBOT, also starring Will Smith. Weird. The CGI faces are identical. Leftover CGI from I ROBOT? Or the same bad Special Effects team? Or does this Scientologist know something about the future that I don't know? The CGI in this looks stupendously awful. (Nothing looks real in this movie. Even New York looks a storyboard.) I thought I was watching the Prequel to I ROBOT. Will Smith once again battles bad CGI characters run amok. Yeah, bwoy!!For the sake of realism, the commercial/music video director, Francis Lawrence should have used real actors and animals instead of this low-budget CGI. Alas, it still wouldn't have saved this from the awful screenplay. However, Smith does get to act crazy with a mannequin. And, he gets to recite lines from his favorite movie, SHREK. Hey, now. A reviewer below compares this to Dawn of The Dead. NOT EVEN in the same ballpark!! The remake or the original!Will Smith is NOT BAD in this. At least the writers and producers kept him from saying one too many smart alecky one-liners and kept him from acting like his usually off-putting conceited self. After his genuinely affecting performance in THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, this is definitely a step down for him. It doesn't serve him well.NOTE: It would have been apropos if Charlton Heston would have sung a Bob Marley tune in THE OMEGA MAN, as he fills a couple of plague ridden albinos full of white hot lead. Of course, THE OMEGA MAN was made before Marley got famous, so Heston could have hummed a few bars of Harry Belafonte's Banana Boat Song. They missed a great opportunity to add real depth to Heston's character.Will Smith seems destined to fashion his career into a string of low-rent sci-fi movies from superior quality sci-fi books. If so, maybe next time he'll do that crazy Scientology Legend of Xenu. (If you've never heard this story, Google it. Some of your favorite movie stars actually believe this stuff.)

657504,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B00005JPTK,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[5, 11]","Hollywood has never had much luck adapting science fiction author Richard Matheson's cult 1954 novel ""I Am Legend"" successfully to the screen. Iconic horror movie star Vincent Price headlined the first version; the Italian-lensed ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) ranked as an austere, but depressing widescreen, black & white epic with vampire/zombies as his antagonists. Call them zompires! Price impersonated a valiant scientist, Robert Morgan, with an acquired immunity to a deadly virus that had devastated mankind. Morgan struggled desperately not only to survive acute loneliness but also to cure the survivors. Full-frame copies of this opus are available everywhere in DVD bargain box sets. Not-surprisingly, Price perished in the end.Charlton Heston retooled the role in the 1971 remake, ""The Omega Man,"" released by Warner Brothers. Heston turned immunologist Robert Neville into a brawny, bare-chested, romantic, action stud hero who cavorted in a blue flight suit with a dress uniform cap complete with scrambled eggs on the visor. Watch ""The Omega Man"" and see if Neville doesn't resemble a Marvel Comics character. Naturally, Heston brought the messianic allure that he had gained from ""The 10 Commandments"" and ""Ben-Hur"" to the role. Along the way, Heston's Neville indulged in one of the first interracial big-screen romances with African-American actress Rosalind Cash. An army of heavily robed, non-vampiric mutants led by Matthias (Anthony Zerbe) triumphed over him, and he died tragically as a misunderstood Christ figure.Will Smith fares even worse in the third and least well-done version, ""I Am Legend"" which finally uses the original title of Matheson's novel. Essentially, Smith imitates the Heston hero as a weapons reliant action hero/virologist. They differ in how they contend with loneliness. Heston played chess with a bust of Julius Caesar and fed images of himself via a surveillance camera onto a big-screen television. Smith's Neville dresses up mannequins at a local video rental store and converses with them when he selects a movie. Unlike both Price and Heston, Smith doesn't enjoy a post-apocalyptic romance. Instead of female companionship, Smith has to settle for a German shepherd; canine lovers are warned ahead of time to expect the worst. Even when a woman, Anna (Alice Braga of ""City of God""), does show up near the end, our hero doesn't take the time to sweep her off her feet.Generally, the problem with all three movies is that the star has to bear the movie on his shoulders for the brunt of the action. Remember that hideous Tom Hanks' movie ""Castaway?"" Half of ""I Am Legend"" looks like ""Castaway"" with Will Smith performing monologues devoid of humor. Sadly, despite a strong performance, Smith has to deal with adversaries that neither Price nor Heston contended with--namely, colorless, chrome-domed, computer-generated cannibals. ""I Am Legend"" forfeits any semblance of dramatic impact, much as ""I, Robot"" did, with its cartoon-like CGI villains. Smith wages an eternal war against video game antagonists who cannot speak, making them dim-witted, lowest-common-denominator dolts.""I Am Legend"" opens on an ironic note. Scientists have discovered a cure for cancer. Things go incredibly amiss, however, and Dr. Krippen (an unbilled Emma Thompson of ""Sense and Sensibility"") winds up unleashing a man-made virus in the year 2009 that transforms humanity into homicidal mutants that plunder and destroy everything in sight. Incidentally, these mutants don't appear until midway in the movie after scenarists Mark Protosevich of ""Poseidon"" and Akiva Goldman of ""Batman & Robin"" have established Smith's character and his predicament. The filmmakers rely on occasional flashbacks to fracture that storyline and show how Smith became the last man on Earth. We learn that his wife (Salli Richardson of TV's ""Eureka"") and daughter (Smith's real-life daughter Willow) died in a helicopter collision around the same time that the military quarantined Manhattan Island and sealed off access to it. The military destroy the two landmark Big Apple bridges, but Neville (Will Smith) vows to remain at ground zero and devise a cure.Three years later, in 2012, Neville and his dog venture outside by day to search for non-infected survivors as well as to forage for food and lock themselves up at night. In an early scene, Neville hunts for fresh meat by pursuing escaped zoo animals through the cluttered, weed-choked canyons of Manhattan in a red Ford Mustang with a high powered rifle. He watches old television shows that he has recorded before the apocalypse while he eats. The mutants themselves are not very interesting. In ""Last Man on Earth,"" the mutants were vampire/zombies that besieged the hero's house at night. In ""The Omega Man,"" the villains were the equivalent of albino Klansmen that terrorized the streets after dark and clashed constantly with Neville.Like the previous versions, ""I Am Legend"" delivers a dour, downbeat ending that will bum you out beyond belief. The special effects are shoddy and superficial; the villains emerge as a mob of one-dimensional, head-banging morons, and the hero degenerates into an ignoble, unsympathetic, atheistic lout. There is nothing exciting or suspenseful about our hero's late-night encounter with the mutants on the docks where he uses his SUV as a weapon to smash them. Even more implausible is the way that he gets out of this cliffhanger confrontation. ""Constantine"" director Francis Lawrence provides several startling, gotcha-by-the-gullet, scare scenes that will frighten the squeamish, but seasoned gorehounds won't find anything different or dazzling about this drivel.Will Smith's track record with science fiction is faltering badly these days. ""I Am Legend"" is nowhere near as memorable or entertaining as either ""Independence Day"" or his ""Men in Black"" movies. Instead, ""I Am Legend"" is legendarily lame!",1,"Theatrical Version of ""I Am Legend""",1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,5916,"['Hollywood', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'luck', 'adapting', 'science',

657511,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B00005JPTK,Wayne C. Rogers,"[1, 2]","The movie, I Am Legend starring Will Smith, is based somewhat loosely on Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name.  Now, most people don't know who Richard Matheson is, but this is the writer who influenced both Stephen King and Dean Koontz where they were teenagers, not to mention thousands of other kids, myself included.  This was the man who wrote some of the most famous Twilight Zone episodes of the sixties, especially Nightmare at Thirty Thousand Feet.  This is the author of the famous horror novel, Hell House, which was also turned into a film.  Flipping the coin over, Matheson is author of the famous romance novel, Bid Time Return, and this was also turned into a major motion picture, though most people know it as Somewhere In Time.  There's also the novel and movie, What Dreams May Come.  Richard Matheson is therefore one of the greatest writers of the last half of the Twentieth Century.  Without him, we might not have had Stephen King and Dean Koontz writing such brilliant books.I Am Legend with Will Smith is the third adaptation of Matheson's novel, and Mr. Smith does a truly excellent job of portraying the lead character Robert Neville, capturing his aloneness and near insanity at being quite possibly the only human being alive.  Neville was the military doctor experimenting with new drugs and viruses in the hope of finding a cure for cancer.  What was discovered, however, wiped out most of the human population, while changing those still alive into flesh-eating zombies, or vampires, that move at a tremendous speed and seemed to be filled with an incurable amount of rage and violence.  Because the creatures can't survive in the sunlight, Neville has control of the day when he and his German Shepard go out hunting for food and raiding the nearby DVD store.  Neville is also still searching for a vaccine that will cure the symptoms of the virus.  He uses zombies that he's captured, and the testing usually results in their deaths.  The night, however, is totally controlled by the creatures, and Neville must always be home by dark in order to barricade himself inside his Washington Square apartment with its reinforced doors and window shutters.  In time a confrontation is inevitable between Neville and the creatures, and this in turn eventually escalates into a full-blown battle at between life and death at the end.I had mixed feeling about the movie when I first saw it at the theater.  When the Two-Disc Special Edition came out, I found myself enjoying the longer alternate version with a different ending.  I think the director, Francis Lawrence, and the Special Effects people did a fabulous job of creating New York City a few years down the road after the plague has done its nasty work, showing the desolate streets with non-moving cars and trash lining the curbs and weeds growing out of the pavement.  And, Will Smith, plays perfectly to this setting, creating a character that is near the end of his rope and talks to mannequins in the DVD store as a way of keeping himself from going crazy, then goes berserk when one of the mannequins shows up in a different location.  Unlike a lot of viewers, I loved the creatures.  The scene where Smith has to go into the basement of a bank to find his dog and runs into a group of them standing together in a group had me dropping popcorn all over my lap.  I felt myself in the darkness with him as well as the strong fear that he was experiencing.  This is definitely one of the best horror scenes done in the last few years.I believe the Two-Disc Special Edition with a longer version of the film and an alternate ending is the way to go.  I do have to say that other than a different version of the movie, there isn't much else offered that I cared about.

657512,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JPTK,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 1]","The nicest thing about being the last man on earth would be not having to pay for parking in Times Square. There's nothing wrong with a good movie. ""I Am Legend"" may miss the mark as a great movie but what it does do it does extremely well. While Francis Lawrence's ""I Am Legend"" (this is the third version of the story told on film based on Richard Matheson's novel of the same name but it inspired countless other films including ""Night of the Living Dead"")may be bigger and bolder than ""The Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man"" (the two other film versions of the same tale), it is the small moments as well as the action sequences that make this film worthwhile.Will Smith plays Dr. Robert Neville a military researcher brought in to solve a cure for cancer that has gone horribly wrong. The virus designed to deliver the payload kills patients with those remaining alive turned into creatures that seem to have no ability to reason and become monsters. Neville fails at stopping the outbreak from spreading but he remains in New York City still searching for a cure accompanied by his only companion a dog his son gave him. While hunting for the ""Night Seekers"" for his experiments, he also must avoid being hunted by them for food.Will Smith gives a terrific, nuanced performance as Neville and is the biggest asset. The visual effects of an abandoned and overgrown Times Square are stunning and captures the sense of isolation that Neville feels. He's not only cut off from the world but he's also cut himself off from many of his own emotions overcome by a sense of failure but still believing ""I can fix this"". There are some other fine performances in the film as well but saying any more about them would provide too many spoilers.The main flaws of the film are the Night Seekers and plot holes in the last act of the film. The Night Seekers are effectively used but we see too much of them (they would have been more frightening in shadow)and they don't look real enough (at least to me). The plot holes in the third act I won't reveal (again, they also reveal spoilers)but suffice to say the film is very good inspite of its flaws.The DVD has two versions of the film. The first on disc 1 is the theatrical cut (which I felt was inferior). The second disc has a short documentary on the real threat we face by viruses both natural and man made with experts from Harvard and other leading research facilities chiming in on the beauty of a virus (which is neithr living or dead according to one researched but somewhere inbetween). The second disc has the alternate cut of the film and there's also a weblink to bonus material. The Blu-ray INCLUDES the bonus featurettes which amount of about 50 minutes of material.We also get animated comics that show the effects of the disease across the world.Speaking of which, the theatrical cut and alternate versions are seamlessly branched on the single disc Blu-ray and HD-DVD.While a flawed film, ""I Am Legend"" is a very good thrill ride with a strong central performance by Will Smith which sells even the weaker aspects of the story. The 2 disc DVD edition really should have been a single disc edition (with the bonus material) like the Blu-ray.",4,In a lonely quest to cure mankind and survive 3 1/2 stars,1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,3206,"['nicest', 'thing', 'being', 'last', 'man', 'earth', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'having', 'pay', 'parking', 'Times', 'Square', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'good', 'movie', 'Am', 'Legend', 'may', 'miss', 'mark', 'great', 'movie', 'what', 'do', 'extremely', 'well', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'Am', 'Legend', 'third', 'version', 'story', 'told', 'film', 'based', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'inspired', 'countless', 'other', 'films', 'including', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'may', 'be', 'bigger', 'bolder', 'Last', 'Man', 'Earth', 'Omega', 'Man', 'two', 'other', 'film', 'versions', 'same', 'tale', 'small', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'make', 'film', 'worthwhile.Will', 'Smith', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'military', 'researcher', 'brought', 'solve', 'cure', 'cancer', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'virus', 'designed', 'deliver', 'payload', 'patients', 'remaining', 'alive', 'turned', 'creatures', 'seem', 'have', 'ability', 'reason', 'become', 'monsters', 'Neville', 'stopping', 'outbreak', 'spreading', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'still', 'searching', 'cure', 'accompanied', 'only', 'companion', 'dog', 'son', 'gave', 'hunting', 'Night', 'Seekers', 'experiments', 'also', 'must', 'avoid', 'being', 'hunted', 'food.Will', 'Smith', 'terrific', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Neville', 'biggest', 'asset', 'visual', 'effects', 'abandoned', 'overgrown', 'Times', 'Square', 'are', 'stunning', 'sense', 'isolation', 'Neville', 'feels', 'not', 'only', 'cut', 'off', 'world', 'also', 'cut', 'many', 'own', 'emotions', 'overcome', 'sense', 'failure', 'still', 'believing', 'can', 'fix', 'are', 'other', 'fine', 'performances', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'saying', 'more', 'would', 'provide', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers.The', 'main', 'flaws', 'film', 'are', 'Night', 'Seekers', 'plot', 'holes', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'Night', 'Seekers', 'are', 'effectively', 'used', 'see', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'frightening', 'shadow', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'real', 'enough', 'least', 'plot', 'holes', 'third', 'act', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'again', 'also', 'reveal', 'spoilers', 'suffice', 'say', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'inspite', 'flaws.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'versions', 'film', 'first', 'disc', '1', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'felt', 'was', 'inferior', 'second', 'disc', 'short', 'documentary', 'real', 'threat', 'face', 'viruses', 'natural', 'man', 'made', 'experts', 'Harvard', 'other', 'leading', 'research', 'facilities', 'chiming', 'beauty', 'virus', 'neithr', 'living', 'dead', 'according', 'one', 'researched', 'somewhere', 'inbetween', 'second', 'disc', 'alternate', 'cut', 'film', 'also', 'weblink', 'bonus', 'material', 'Blu-ray', 'INCLUDES', 'bonus', 'amount', '50', 'minutes', 'material.We', 'also', 'get', 'animated', 'comics', 'show', 'effects', 'disease', 'world.Speaking', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'alternate', 'versions', 'are', 'seamlessly', 'branched', 'single', 'disc', 'Blu-ray', 'HD-DVD.While', 'flawed', 'film', 'Am', 'Legend', 'very', 'good', 'thrill', 'ride', 'strong', 'central', 'performance', 'Will', 'Smith', 'even', 'weaker', 'aspects', 'story', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'edition', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'bonus', 'material', 'Blu-ray']",I Am Legend

I even accepted the dystopian ending and the escape of the woman and child while Neville blew himself and the creatures up at the end.  Today I saw the alternate ending which is suppposed to be the original ending where there is a reconciliation (the woman with the butterfly tattoo is the male vampire's companion) as she regains humanity as a result of Neville's work.This is a happy ending that reminds me of Blade Runner's original ending where Deckard and the perfect replicant, Rachel, escape.(Did I dream that part?) Did anybody notice the peace crane left by Gaff? Not everything has to end on a final note of death.In ""The Twelve Monkeys"" and ""28 Days Later"" we also have the unleashing of a deadly virus caused by medical science. As in the 1950's with our fears of atomic bombs being unleashed everywhere and altering genetic structure, ""Them"" with James Arness, and ""Godzilla,"" we seem to have become enamoured (if that word can be used) by our fascination with vampires and biological warfare doing us in.

657523,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B00005JPTK,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[4, 4]","I AM LEGEND is a sci-fi disaster film that is another attempt at adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel back in the early `50's. The first adaptation being ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) with Vincent Price and the cheesy but entertaining ""Omega Men"" (1971) with Charlton Heston. Being a remake, ""I am Legend"" leaves a lot to be desired with the unpredictability factor. However, with the current evolution in CGI effects, expectations would be high. ""Legend"" is the one version bestowed with a huge budget.A cure for cancer based on the Measles virus of old has achieved partial success. While it does cure the lethal disease, it was one side effect; it mutates human beings into vampire-like creatures that feed on human flesh. Military scientist Robert Neville (Will Smith) is left alone in New York with only a German Shepherd for company, for 3 years he has been looking for a cure but to no avail. Slowly, he is starting to give in to the pressure of being alone and hopelessness begins to sink in. Now, as new survivors surface, Neville is caught by surprise and finds a struggle within himself to remain optimistic in finding a cure or wonder if the human race has been snuffed out for good.The direction by Francis Lawrence (Constantine) is competent enough to handle this kind of project. The first half of the film shows Neville and his dog, Sam in their daily routine. They try to battle boredom and mental collapse by hunting deers, driving around the ""ghost city"" looking for supplies and even renting videos, hitting golf balls off the East River. It was smart for the director to establish a rendezvous point for potential survivors alongside the river at noon everyday. Neville's loneliness is also emphasized that he has set up a certain spot where he had arranged mannequins as an attempt to simulate a crowd. It was very considerate of the director to consider certain emotions that can creep in when one is isolated in large Empty City with certain creatures lurking in the night. Along with the very delicate link of sanity Neville has to his dog, one can wonder how long a man left alone can last. Certain situation studies have been explored before in films such as ""Castaway"". Luckily, Neville has more company with a dog than just a volleyball, the dog certainly had more charisma than ""Wilson the volleyball"". The past is also shown in flashbacks as to what happened to Neville and New York.The film's success also depends on how good the performance is of the lead actor. Will Smith has definitely matured as an actor since his days in ""Fresh Prince"". Smith's performance is pretty solid as the lead; while he mostly plays a reactionary role, he manages to express the needed emotions in the sequences that I felt his fears, thoughts and loneliness. Sure, there is still the usual snappy charisma that has become his trademark but he manages to sidestep that image and pulls off a very good performance.The film isn't perfect. There is a HUGE plot hole in the beginning of the last act, Neville's meeting with a survivor seemed so convenient that it's almost far-fetched. The ""Dark Seekers"" have that charcoaled-grayish-dehydrated look that seemed a little fake. (I thought I was watching a Pang Bros. Horror flick for a moment). Thankfully, the characteristics of the creatures are more interesting; they are stronger and faster than the zombies in 28 DAYS LATER, and to make things worst for Neville, they are a lot smarter. This intelligence was displayed with their observance of a ""pack leader"" and the ability to learn and imitate what they have seen.Unfortunately, the film didn't have the guts to follow through with its dark premise of pure despair of a lonely man in large city. It opted to settle for the usual heroics and while the film did have some emotional and intense sequences that redeemed it, it went on the direction of faith and Catholicism. While there may be nothing wrong in trying to emphasize human optimism and belief in a higher power, the conclusion was a little less satisfying and quite frankly, it collapsed in its predictability. ""I Am Legend"" carried a lot of potential but ultimately, it stumbles halfway through and lacked a very powerful climax. I am sad to say it fell just a little short of its truly majestic vision.Recommended!

In Equilibrium, a brilliant movie, flashbacks were used more effectively to intensify dramatic moments.

657527,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JPTK,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","As I viewed this film, it quickly become clear to me that two very different themes are being explored by director Francis Lawrence in this film, one that works and one that does not:The first, more wide-reaching theme, is the fate of the human race, which Robert Neville (Will Smith) is working desperately to save throughout the movie.  I can't tell you the state of humanity at the end of the film without spoiling some things, but suffice it to say that there is a good chance you will feel a bit let down by the lack of resolution to this theme.The theme that works quite well, however, is how Neville copes with being the ""last man on Earth"".  His internal struggles and outward devices (such as talking to mannequins, for instance) that he uses to keep some semblance of his sanity are intriguing, and Smith is a well-rounded enough actor to portray the wide variety of emotions his character must express.Overall, then, this is a decent enough film (worth a rent), but lacks enough of a payoff in the end to be considered a real classic.  I found this film to be much in the vein of J.J. Abram's recent hit ""Cloverfield"", where little to nothing is explained or expanded on...viewers are just supposed to live in the moment.  Yet, with the way that Neville's family is developed in this film (unlike the anonymous characters of Cloverfield), I think that the lack of a conclusive ending was more apparent.",3,"No Resolution, But Still A Decent Film",1219190400,"08 20, 2008",2008,1413,"['viewed', 'film', 'quickly', 'become', 'clear', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'themes', 'are', 'being', 'explored', 'director', 'Francis', 'Lawrence', 'film', 'one', 'one', 'not', 'first', 'more', 'wide-reaching', 'theme', 'fate', 'human', 'race', 'Robert', 'Neville', 'Will', 'Smith', 'working', 'desperately', 'save', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'state', 'humanity', 'end', 'film', 'spoiling', 'things', 'say', 'good', 'chance', 'will', 'feel', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'lack', 'resolution', 'theme.The', 'theme', 'quite', 'well', 'however', 'how', 'Neville', 'being', 'last', 'man', 'Earth', 'internal', 'struggles', 'outward', 'devices', 'such', 'talking', 'mannequins', 'instance', 'keep', 'semblance', 'sanity', 'are', 'intriguing', 'Smith', 'well-rounded', 'enough', 'actor', 'portray', 'wide', 'variety', 'emotions', 'character', 'must', 'express.Overall', 'then', 'decent', 'enough', 'film', 'rent', 'enough', 'payoff', 'end', 'be', 'considered', 'real', 'classic', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'much', 'vein', 'J.J.', 'Abram', 'recent', 'hit', 'Cloverfield', 'where', 'little', 'nothing', 'explained', 'expanded', 'viewers', 'are', 'just', 'supposed', 'live', 'moment', 'way', 'Neville', 'family', 'developed', 'film', 'anonymous', 'characters', 'Cloverfield', 'think', 'lack', 'conclusive', 'ending', 'was', 'more', 'apparent']",I Am Legend
