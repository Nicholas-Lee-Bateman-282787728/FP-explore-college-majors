Looks like they went back to the original film to create the DVD version.  There's enough of a story to tie the scenes together (notice I didn't say plot).  Both movies have a mix of characters who are either hesitant in their sexuality or full blown addicts.  In the end, everyone does everyone, and the pseudo-sex is both beautiful and convincing.",4,Fun to watch,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,436,"['movie', '70', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'went', 'back', 'original', 'film', 'create', 'DVD', 'version', 'enough', 'story', 'tie', 'scenes', 'together', 'notice', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'plot', 'movies', 'have', 'mix', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'hesitant', 'sexuality', 'full', 'blown', 'addicts', 'end', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'pseudo-sex', 'beautiful', 'convincing']",N/A
947948,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000BQ7J5M,Jeffery Mingo,"[18, 48]","All movies get kitsch after a few decades, but this movie had that quality from the jump.  This was made in the 1970s, so it's full of loud clothing and furniture.  The actresses have overdone makeup.  There are turtlenecks and butterfly collars too.Still, other flaws are purposeful and specific.  Though not related, every actress in this had reddish-brown hair.  When the film's title comes on the screen, ""Lesley"" is spelled differently from the disc cover.  Every actor has bad timing and the script is terribly weak.I wonder if the director Joseph Sarno and hottie Sonny Landham have beef with each other.  The disc description calls Sonny a ""B [movie] favorite.""  On Sonny's website, he does not include this work in his filmography.  Still, he is on the cover, though he is not the main male actor.  Then again, they don't list his name on the front cover of the disc.  At one point, he wears an Elvis outfit which must be a reference to his incredibly low voice that sounds like the late singer.  Most importantly, you get to see more of Sonny than you do in any other non-adult film, if you know what I mean.Actually, every man in this film has an adult industry background.  I wonder if this is why they were comfortable in exposing themselves as much as the actresses did.  Too bad more actors don't take their lead.  There is much girl-on-girl action here.  This is decades before it become a major trend.  Still, it is more about titillating straight men than empowering lesbians.",2,A 1970s Softcore Extravaganza!,1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,1494,"['movies', 'get', 'kitsch', 'few', 'decades', 'movie', 'had', 'quality', 'jump', 'was', 'made', '1970s', 'full', 'loud', 'clothing', 'furniture', 'actresses', 'have', 'overdone', 'makeup', 'are', 'turtlenecks', 'butterfly', 'collars', 'too.Still', 'other', 'flaws', 'are', 'purposeful', 'specific', 'not', 'related', 'actress', 'had', 'reddish-brown', 'hair', 'When', 'film', 'title', 'screen', 'Lesley', 'spelled', 'differently', 'disc', 'cover', 'actor', 'bad', 'timing', 'script', 'terribly', 'weak.I', 'wonder', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Sarno', 'hottie', 'Sonny', 'Landham', 'have', 'beef', 'other', 'disc', 'description', 'Sonny', 'B', '[', 'movie', ']', 'favorite', 'Sonny', 'website', 'not', 'include', 'work', 'filmography', 'Still', 'cover', 'not', 'main', 'male', 'actor', 'Then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'list', 'name', 'front', 'cover', 'disc', 'one', 'point', 'Elvis', 'outfit', 'must', 'be', 'reference', 'incredibly', 'low', 'voice', 'late', 'singer', 'Most', 'importantly', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'Sonny', 'do', 'other', 'non-adult', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'mean.Actually', 'man', 'film', 'adult', 'industry', 'background', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', 'comfortable', 'exposing', 'as', 'much', 'actresses', 'did', 'Too', 'bad', 'more', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'lead', 'much', 'girl-on-girl', 'action', 'here', 'decades', 'become', 'major', 'trend', 'Still', 'more', 'titillating', 'straight', 'men', 'empowering', 'lesbians']",N/A

947950,AD23KS0RVEF7L,B000BQ7J5M,Marilyn Fan,"[37, 38]","Abigail Lesley has a reasonable plot, and certainly has nudity if that's what you are looking for. Rebecca Brooke is very easy on the eyes, and the other actors are acceptably attractive (cannot say this of All The Sins of Sodom). The acting is relatively good save for a few attempts at profound deep thinking out loud (cannot say this of All The Sins of Sodom). I must have missed the plot of Laura's Toys, but it is interesting to see Rebecca Brooke play the two different personalities in the two films.If this is considered erotica, I find it difficult to distinguish these films from hard-core porn; admittedly there are no erections or insertions filmed. But I have no idea how the scenes were filmed without the activity being real, and certainly the sex scenes were vicariously arousing. There are many very realistic all-women scenes, with lots of women! Laura's Toys overused one spoken line; it will be obvious when you begin hearing it, and it's probably the least needed phrase in the movie.So the writing for both films is somewhat weak, but the filming is excellent with an attractive cast.",4,Abigail and Laura,1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,1106,"['Abigail', 'Lesley', 'reasonable', 'plot', 'certainly', 'nudity', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'Rebecca', 'Brooke', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'acceptably', 'attractive', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'Sins', 'Sodom', 'acting', 'relatively', 'good', 'save', 'few', 'attempts', 'profound', 'deep', 'thinking', 'out', 'loud', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'Sins', 'Sodom', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'plot', 'Laura', 'Toys', 'interesting', 'see', 'Rebecca', 'Brooke', 'play', 'two', 'different', 'personalities', 'two', 'films.If', 'considered', 'erotica', 'find', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'films', 'hard-core', 'porn', 'admittedly', 'are', 'erections', 'insertions', 'filmed', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'activity', 'being', 'real', 'certainly', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'vicariously', 'arousing', 'are', 'many', 'very', 'realistic', 'all-women', 'scenes', 'lots', 'women', 'Laura', 'Toys', 'overused', 'one', 'spoken', 'line', 'will', 'be', 'obvious', 'when', 'begin', 'hearing', 'probably', 'least', 'needed', 'phrase', 'movie.So', 'writing', 'films', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'filming', 'excellent', 'attractive', 'cast']",N/A
