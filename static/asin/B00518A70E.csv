The film's ""message"" is beautifully rendered. The special effects are a bit weak, though for 1957 they're good. However, when the tiny man runs across the basement floor, there's no shadow, no sense of actually being there. Certainly the over-sized props work...but then that's nothing new to Hollywood. Laurel & Hardy played with this concept when they played their own children in a short called BRATS. The scene where the cat is trying to get at our hero through the windows of the doll's house is weak because of the focus. Rear-screen projection NEVER works! Also, from when I read this as a kid I have always remembered the concept that when the tiny, almost insect-sized man falls a great distance, he isn't harmed because the smaller you get, the less likely you are to be injured in a fall. That isn't mentioned in the film anywhere. I sort of missed it!But what's really annoying, as other reviewers have pointed out, is the total lack of bonus features (other than a trailer). I felt cheated, because this movie, as much as IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA, which I bought from Amazon and watched a couple of nights ago, demands a commentary track if not a making-of documentary. IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA is in a 2-disc edition, with a whole second disc devoted to discussions of the effects and how they were accomplished. This sort of thing fascinates me.So I give this three stars. It deserves more and certainly would have had a full five if they'd provided bonus material. But at least we have the movie now, not just a part of an anthology, which is the only version available until recently.",3,Somewhat Dated But Very Good,1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,1725,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'customer', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'yet', 'have', 'agree', 'whole-heartedly', 'did', 'read', 'film', 'message', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'bit', 'weak', '1957', ""'re"", 'good', 'However', 'when', 'tiny', 'man', 'basement', 'floor', 'shadow', 'sense', 'actually', 'being', 'there', 'Certainly', 'over-sized', 'props', 'work', 'then', 'nothing', 'new', 'Hollywood', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'played', 'concept', 'when', 'played', 'own', 'children', 'short', 'called', 'BRATS', 'scene', 'where', 'cat', 'trying', 'get', 'hero', 'windows', 'doll', 'house', 'weak', 'focus', 'Rear-screen', 'projection', 'NEVER', 'Also', 'when', 'read', 'kid', 'have', 'always', 'remembered', 'concept', 'when', 'tiny', 'almost', 'insect-sized', 'man', 'great', 'distance', ""n't"", 'harmed', 'smaller', 'get', 'less', 'likely', 'are', 'be', 'injured', 'fall', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'film', 'anywhere', 'sort', 'missed', 'what', 'really', 'annoying', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'total', 'lack', 'bonus', 'features', 'other', 'trailer', 'felt', 'cheated', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'IT', 'CAME', 'FROM', 'BENEATH', 'THE', 'SEA', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'watched', 'couple', 'nights', 'ago', 'commentary', 'track', 'not', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'IT', 'CAME', 'FROM', 'BENEATH', 'THE', 'SEA', '2-disc', 'edition', 'whole', 'second', 'disc', 'devoted', 'discussions', 'effects', 'how', 'were', 'accomplished', 'sort', 'thing', 'fascinates', 'me.So', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'more', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'full', 'five', ""'d"", 'provided', 'bonus', 'material', 'least', 'have', 'movie', 'now', 'not', 'just', 'part', 'anthology', 'only', 'version', 'available', 'recently']",N/A
1436296,A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI,B00518A70E,JAMES MCCORMICK,"[2, 2]","5 Stars = MasterpieceMaybe the greatest Sc-Fi film of the 50's, ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is a milestone in Sci-Fi. The story of a man, Scott Carey, who while with his wife on a cabin cruiser, runs into mysterious radioactive mist, that leaves little sprinkles of sparkling flakes all over his body. His wife down in the cabin, does not come in contact with the mist. Everything is fine for awhile, then Scott begins to shrink at an alarming rate!""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is a movie filled with ideas. The idea of the smaller you get, the less important you are. The idea of your own self worth, as the world becomes bigger & you become smaller. The idea of every day objects, situations, even pets, become an ominous & dangerous reality for Scott Carey.""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is just filled with incredible extraordinary scenes of sheer white knuckled intensity! Among them is the pet cat, who the smaller Scott becomes, the more menacing is his beloved pet. Finally Scott becomes so small that the cat stalks him like a mouse, as he is now living in a doll house. This scene is alarmingly potent, as the cat becomes a giant hungry predator trying to get at Scott through the doll house. The viciousness of the scene is truly hair raising. Your beloved pet, becomes your worse nightmare! Another equally remarkable scene, is the struggle in the basement between Scott & what is by now, a huge Wolf spider, who is stalking Scott through a good part of the film. Scott has to devise a way, any way he can, to destroy his foe. Another terror is the simple turning on of the water heater's drain faucet, as a huge life threatening flood engulfs Scott, sweeping him towards the basement drain. Yes, mundane every day objects become huge dangerous obstacles & weapons. A pencil turns into the size of a large log. A threading needle, that is the size of a javelin in Scott's hands. Basement walls & stairs, whose heights become mountainous. Scott living in a box of wooden matches, as a shelter. Even people walking around Scott like lumbering giants, the size of Godzilla, who might smash him with a single foot step. These are just a few of the many hardships he has to face.""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is also filled with scenes of tragic emotional loss & realization. The smaller Scott becomes, he feels that he is loosing control over his relationship with his wife. He starts to become a little tyrant, accusing her of seeing other men, demanding more attention. His wife being pushed away by his actions, but still loving him. Then he disappears, & his wife fearful & filled with remorse that the cat might have devoured him, while she was away from the house. The brother, who seems to take advantage of Scott's situation, who may want his wife? Yes, the smaller Scott becomes, the smaller he feels his importance is to not just his loved ones, but to himself, until at the end, he realizes, yes, as small as he is, he still matters, & the world is a new universe for him to explore.Tremendous special effects for it's time, ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is a film of massively creative ingenuity, creating a giant menacing world for a man who becomes ever smaller. Director extraordinaire, Jack Arnold (The Creature From the Black Lagoon & It Came From Outer Space) is truly a pioneering director in Science Fiction! If you get a chance, watch how they made this film, truly astounding! But if anything, watch this masterpiece of Science Fiction for all it's thrill's, tragedy, & discovering self awareness of a man who thought the world forgot him, & most of all, forgot himself.",5,"A Man May Shrink, But He Is Still A Man",1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,3607,"['5', 'Stars', '=', 'MasterpieceMaybe', 'greatest', 'Sc-Fi', 'film', '50', 'Incredible', 'Shrinking', 'Man', 'milestone', 'Sci-Fi', 'story', 'man', 'Scott', 'Carey', 'who', 'wife', 'cabin', 'cruiser', 'mysterious', 'radioactive', 'mist', 'little', 'sprinkles', 'sparkling', 'flakes', 'body', 'wife', 'down', 'cabin', 'not', 'come', 'contact', 'mist', 'Everything', 'fine', 'awhile', 'then', 'Scott', 'shrink', 'alarming', 'rate', 'Incredible', 'Shrinking', 'Man', 'movie', 'filled', 'ideas', 'idea', 'smaller', 'get', 'less', 'important', 'are', 'idea', 'own', 'self', 'worth', 'world', 'bigger', 'become', 'smaller', 'idea', 'day', 'situations', 'even', 'pets', 'become', 'ominous', 'dangerous', 'reality', 'Scott', 'Carey', 'Incredible', 'Shrinking', 'Man', 'just', 'filled', 'incredible', 'extraordinary', 'scenes', 'sheer', 'white', 'knuckled', 'intensity', 'pet', 'cat', 'who', 'smaller', 'Scott', 'becomes', 'more', 'menacing', 'beloved', 'pet', 'Finally', 'Scott', 'so', 'small', 'cat', 'stalks', 'mouse', 'now', 'living', 'doll', 'house', 'scene', 'alarmingly', 'potent', 'cat', 'giant', 'hungry', 'predator', 'trying', 'get', 'Scott', 'doll', 'house', 'viciousness', 'scene', 'truly', 'hair', 'raising', 'beloved', 'pet', 'worse', 'nightmare', 'equally', 'remarkable', 'scene', 'struggle', 'basement', 'Scott', 'what', 'now', 'huge', 'Wolf', 'spider', 'who', 'stalking', 'Scott', 'good', 'part', 'film', 'Scott', 'devise', 'way', 'way', 'can', 'destroy', 'foe', 'terror', 'simple', 'turning', 'water', 'heater', 'drain', 'faucet', 'huge', 'life', 'threatening', 'flood', 'engulfs', 'Scott', 'sweeping', 'basement', 'drain', 'Yes', 'mundane', 'day', 'become', 'huge', 'dangerous', 'obstacles', 'weapons', 'pencil', 'size', 'large', 'log', 'threading', 'needle', 'size', 'javelin', 'Scott', 'hands', 'Basement', 'stairs', 'heights', 'become', 'mountainous', 'Scott', 'living', 'box', 'wooden', 'matches', 'shelter', 'Even', 'people', 'walking', 'around', 'Scott', 'lumbering', 'giants', 'size', 'Godzilla', 'who', 'might', 'smash', 'single', 'foot', 'step', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'many', 'hardships', 'face', 'Incredible', 'Shrinking', 'Man', 'also', 'filled', 'scenes', 'tragic', 'emotional', 'loss', 'realization', 'smaller', 'Scott', 'becomes', 'loosing', 'control', 'relationship', 'wife', 'become', 'little', 'tyrant', 'accusing', 'seeing', 'other', 'men', 'demanding', 'more', 'attention', 'wife', 'being', 'pushed', 'away', 'actions', 'still', 'loving', 'Then', 'wife', 'fearful', 'filled', 'remorse', 'cat', 'might', 'have', 'devoured', 'was', 'away', 'house', 'brother', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'Scott', 'situation', 'who', 'may', 'want', 'wife', 'Yes', 'smaller', 'Scott', 'becomes', 'smaller', 'importance', 'not', 'just', 'loved', 'ones', 'end', 'yes', 'as', 'small', 'still', 'matters', 'world', 'new', 'universe', 'explore.Tremendous', 'special', 'effects', 'time', 'Incredible', 'Shrinking', 'Man', 'film', 'massively', 'creative', 'ingenuity', 'creating', 'giant', 'menacing', 'world', 'man', 'who', 'ever', 'smaller', 'Director', 'extraordinaire', 'Jack', 'Arnold', 'Creature', 'Black', 'Lagoon', 'Came', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', 'truly', 'pioneering', 'director', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'get', 'chance', 'watch', 'how', 'made', 'film', 'truly', 'astounding', 'anything', 'watch', 'masterpiece', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'thrill', 'tragedy', 'discovering', 'awareness', 'man', 'who', 'thought', 'world', 'forgot', 'most', 'forgot']",N/A

Scott Carey (Grant Williams)encounters a strange radioactive mist while laying on the deck during a leisurely boating trip.  What follows is truly incredible.  Scott begins to shrink. When he reaches the miniscule height of two inches, that's where the real fun begins.  Everything we as normal, full-sized people take for granted, takes on a whole new meaning, from the family cat who is now the size of a dinosaur to spiders and so many other common household threats. The family domicile metamorphosed into a killing field. Thought-provoking and suspenseful.  The special effects were groundbreaking in 1957 and still hold up today.  Some of the greatest moments in movie history are here. If you have seen it before, watch it again.  If you have never seen it, be ready for a real treat.  Definitely one of those movies (like Citizen Kane or The Wizard Of Oz or The Day The Earth Stood Still)that needs to be in every serious movie watcher's collection. And one of the reasons that we can look back and see when Hollywood was still making movies that were based on emotion, acting and not mindless, repetitive CGI fight-scenes and gratuitous full-frontal nudity.

Seriously folks, 4K upconverts DVDs into near BD quality when 1) the transfer is 480p (into the 8Mbps range or higher) and 2) when the DVD is in the wide-screen format. This transfer is about as good as it gets: excellent print, high res, and in a modified &#34;full screen&#34; format so that everyone is not squished down and made too short and wide and big-headed. I will say as a word of caution I am watching on a 25&#34; Asus computer monitor so it may not look as good on a big-screen. As far as the film itself, it is a little &#34;talky&#34; for the first 30 minutes and I could do without Scott's little walk (well, it HAD to be little didn't it?) to the sideshow and subsequent coffee with the female midget, but everything builds up to the truly EPIC basement scenes that are, IMHO, among the very best from the 1950s era fantasy/sci-fi genre. His battle with the spider had me CRAWLING on the floor when I was a kid, twisting myself in knots trying to give Our Hero some sympathetic magical help. The whole battle is a classic and beautifully done so that even CGI-jaded youngins will be impressed. Then we come to the final scene as Scott accepts his fate and his inner monologue becomes a transcendent elegy to himself and all mankind as he crosses the boundary between the fantastically small and the fantastically large. The final 2 lines are among the most moving in the history of cinema, and you will have to watch the movie to find out what they are.

The protagonist was handsome, it had terrifying details in a normal house, and the effects looked believably horrific.  I even got a paperback version of it, which was superlatively written, in the same style as the internal dialogue of the shrinking man.  I had to see it again.OK, as a 50s film, it is the magic of radiation at the base of it.  A couple are on a sail boat trip, the husband is outside and caught in a strange mist though his wife isn't.  Upon their return home, he notices that he is losing weight.  The doctor confirms this and that he is getting smaller, which the couple suspected.  As the process continues, the house cat attacks him and he escapes, and yet is trapped in, the basement.  There, as he searches for food and continues to shrink, he finds a horrifying new adversary, a spider.What distinguishes this film is the dialogue the man has with himself.  He finds his masculinity compromised and takes a lot of it out on his wife, but then he turns to survival and the reasons he is trying to live, all while he appears doomed to disappear.  His plight is completely believable, and his thinking evolves from rage to survival to a kind of transcendence.  There is a horrible scene where his wife, who thinks the cat got him, comes into the basement to de-block a drain and fails to hear him as he screams for help, holding onto a pencil to avoid being sucked into the drain.  He also contemplates letting the spider get him, a hideous death, but quick.  THen, in a moment of triumph, he achieves a kind of peace with himself, finds his place in the universe and its mysteries.This is really great scifi.

What makes the film special is the script by Richard Matheson and the pensive ending added on by the director Jack Arnold that takes this Sci Fi adventure to the next level of classic film and true Science Fiction. The ending of this movie is organic, it goes where it has to go. It is also extremely creative. By the time we follow Scott Carey to the window looking out into the world, we understand his feelings and marvel at his courage as he looks at what lies in his future.
