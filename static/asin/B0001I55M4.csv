806231,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0001I55M4,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 5]","I really enjoyed this film. There was something about this film that just brought a smile to my face. There wasn't any CGI, there weren't any explosions or curse words, and there wasn't any sex, just women doing whatever they could to raise money for a friend. The theme of friendship was so relevant in this movie that it brought joy to me to know that this sort of friendship exists all over the world. That people are willing to sacrifice everything to ensure that their ""friend"" is helped in every way possible. This was a joy to see. Living in the world that we do, hatred lurking around every dark corner, it was a pleasure just to enjoy a film that had a theme of happiness and friendship, instead of sex, booze, and violence. It was a warm welcome in our ""action movie"" society. These were real people conquering real problems using only their minds, words, and friends. Perhaps it is a lesson for all of us next time we consider the option of violence to solve whatever problem ails us.Continuing with the idea of reality, I would like to stress another reason why this film was so good. The genuine emotion behind the film was strong. There was a sense of love in every shot, even those where you think it could not exist, it is there. This film felt very real to me. While I know it was based on a true story, there was something about the characters and the way that it was filmed that had me rooting for these women from the beginning. Perhaps it is the element of community that is built early on in the film, or again, the theme of friendship that is a driving force behind most of the action in Calendar Girls, but this film gave me that warm fuzzy sensation that had not been felt by any other film watched this weekend.What are the elements that I think made this film into an amazing picture? I would have to go with the believability of the story. As I mentioned above, the realism was apparent throughout all the actions that these ladies do. I really felt this could happen ... and it did! The acting was superb. Helen Mirren and Julie Walters do an exceptional job of playing best friends. I could see it from the moment they first spoke. Words were not needed to see the bond between these two characters, which ultimately made for enjoyable viewing. With these two key players in place, the rest of the ladies seemed like sheer perfection. They each fit their part to the ""T"". They made me laugh, tear up at times, and bring out a real emotion that other films could not. Then finally, there was the background. This was set in one of the most beautiful locations in England, and it only helps solidify the rest of the story. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough between Chris and her son. He was hugely defying her in many ways, but instead she chose to ignore it and pursue her dream in Hollywood. I needed more from this back-story, but unfortunately it never arrived.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Don't. Touch.

When you take an actress as comfortable in her own skin and throw her into a film as cheeky as this one, you can almost guarantee brilliance.Watching Mirren balance the saucy fun with the good-hearted sentiment is a pure joy.The film is based on a true story revolving around a few fifty-something ladies and their attempt to pay tribute to a man they all loved.  When Annie's husband dies from cancer, some of her friends (led by the outspoken Chris) take it upon themselves to raise some money for the hospital to purchase a new (and more comfortable) sofa for those who wait day in and day out for news of a loved ones condition.  Having spent a great deal of time in the discomfort of the hospital waiting room, Annie and Chris know what they are talking about.  In an attempt to not merely raise money, but also raise awareness, Chris convinces her fellow `Local Women's Institute' members to pose nude for a calendar.Enter controversy.Helen Mirren must be given a ridiculous amount of praise for what she was able to do with this film.  Her mere presence alone is worth the price of admission, but her ability to add the right amount of cheekiness with the right amount of earnest sentiment made her character transformation not only wholly believable but completely endearing and relatable.  You understood this woman, even when her motives seemed misplaced.  She commanded a scene, making herself known to all, but you never missed the slight twitch of humanity scratching beneath that harsh exterior.And yes, I think Helen Mirren is hot.For a film that is the epitome of `chick flick sentiment', `Calendar Girls' becomes something so much more thanks to the performances, which are so in tune with one another and with the films purpose.`Calendar Girls' is cheeky fun with a heart of gold.",5,The naked truth...,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,1927,"['love', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'utterly', 'fantastic', 'oh', 'so', 'lovely', 'hilariously', 'on-point', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'lay', 'eyes', 'When', 'take', 'actress', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skin', 'throw', 'film', 'as', 'cheeky', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'brilliance.Watching', 'Mirren', 'balance', 'saucy', 'fun', 'good-hearted', 'sentiment', 'pure', 'joy.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'revolving', 'few', 'fifty-something', 'ladies', 'attempt', 'pay', 'tribute', 'man', 'loved', 'When', 'Annie', 'husband', 'cancer', 'friends', 'led', 'outspoken', 'Chris', 'take', 'raise', 'money', 'hospital', 'purchase', 'new', 'more', 'comfortable', 'sofa', 'who', 'wait', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'news', 'loved', 'ones', 'condition', 'Having', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'discomfort', 'hospital', 'waiting', 'room', 'Annie', 'Chris', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'attempt', 'not', 'merely', 'raise', 'money', 'also', 'raise', 'awareness', 'Chris', 'fellow', 'Local', 'Women', 'Institute', 'members', 'pose', 'nude', 'calendar.Enter', 'controversy.Helen', 'Mirren', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'ridiculous', 'amount', 'praise', 'what', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'film', 'mere', 'presence', 'alone', 'price', 'admission', 'ability', 'add', 'right', 'amount', 'cheekiness', 'right', 'amount', 'earnest', 'sentiment', 'made', 'character', 'transformation', 'not', 'only', 'wholly', 'believable', 'completely', 'endearing', 'relatable', 'understood', 'woman', 'even', 'when', 'motives', 'seemed', 'misplaced', 'commanded', 'scene', 'making', 'known', 'never', 'missed', 'slight', 'twitch', 'humanity', 'scratching', 'beneath', 'harsh', 'exterior.And', 'yes', 'think', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'film', 'epitome', 'chick', 'flick', 'sentiment', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'becomes', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'thanks', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'tune', 'one', 'films', 'purpose.', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'cheeky', 'fun', 'heart', 'gold']",N/A

Ryan ""Merribelle""","[0, 0]","Despite the suggestive nature of the title and the idea that these women posed nude, Calendar Girls is really very wholesome and PG.  This is the type of movie you can safely see with church friends, your mother, and/or your sisters.The members of Napely, England's chapter of the Women's Institute have been in a rut for quite some time now with trivial activities and a yearly fundraiser that barely breaks even.  Best friends Chris and Annie only joined because their mothers wanted it and because, well, there's not much else to do for fifty-somethings in a northern village.  When Annie's husband tragically dies of cancer one year, the two are inspired to raise money for cancer research and break out of their ruts and their stereotypes as middle-aged women; an artistic calendar featuring nude chapter members is just the thing.Naturally, the very idea sends the whole country into an uproar as soon as the calendars are released.Calendar Girls has a charm and a snickering wit about it that makes for a surprisingly entertaining film.  This story could have turned slapstick or lewd, but I find that it was actually very tastefully done.  In fact, much of the plot really involved the funny and touching releationships between the women of this idyllic village.  Without being heavyhanded on the central message, the story suggests a hopefulness to the viewer; the idea that nobody runs out of potential at any age, and that indeed anything is still possible for those who challenge their own perceived limits in life.  And of course as an American, I thought the ""snapshots"" of life in northern Britain were a very charming bonus.I can happily recommend Calendar Girls to just about anybody over the age of 10, but especially to women who would dearly love to see what happens when the world is shocked just a little and forced to change its view of women that are typically taken for granted.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",4,The flowers of England in full bloom and full wit.,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,1926,"['suggestive', 'nature', 'title', 'idea', 'women', 'posed', 'nude', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'really', 'very', 'wholesome', 'PG', 'type', 'movie', 'can', 'safely', 'see', 'church', 'friends', 'mother', 'and/or', 'sisters.The', 'members', 'Napely', 'England', 'chapter', 'Women', 'Institute', 'have', 'been', 'rut', 'quite', 'time', 'now', 'trivial', 'activities', 'yearly', 'fundraiser', 'barely', 'breaks', 'even', 'Best', 'friends', 'Chris', 'Annie', 'only', 'joined', 'mothers', 'wanted', 'because', 'well', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'do', 'fifty-somethings', 'northern', 'village', 'When', 'Annie', 'husband', 'tragically', 'cancer', 'one', 'year', 'two', 'are', 'inspired', 'raise', 'money', 'cancer', 'research', 'break', 'ruts', 'stereotypes', 'middle-aged', 'women', 'artistic', 'calendar', 'featuring', 'nude', 'chapter', 'members', 'just', 'thing.Naturally', 'very', 'idea', 'whole', 'country', 'uproar', 'as', 'soon', 'calendars', 'are', 'released.Calendar', 'Girls', 'charm', 'snickering', 'wit', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'slapstick', 'lewd', 'find', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'tastefully', 'done', 'fact', 'much', 'plot', 'really', 'involved', 'funny', 'touching', 'releationships', 'women', 'idyllic', 'village', 'being', 'heavyhanded', 'central', 'message', 'story', 'hopefulness', 'viewer', 'idea', 'nobody', 'potential', 'age', 'indeed', 'anything', 'still', 'possible', 'who', 'challenge', 'own', 'perceived', 'limits', 'life', 'course', 'American', 'thought', 'snapshots', 'life', 'northern', 'Britain', 'were', 'very', 'charming', 'bonus.I', 'can', 'happily', 'recommend', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'just', 'anybody', 'age', '10', 'especially', 'women', 'who', 'would', 'dearly', 'love', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'world', 'shocked', 'just', 'little', 'forced', 'change', 'view', 'women', 'are', 'typically', 'taken', 'granted.-Andrea', 'aka', 'Merribelle']",N/A

No need to fear, because the movie is about a lot more than aping a successful indie formula.  The movie centers on a group of women of Rylstone Women's Institute in North Yorkshire, England who through a tragedy decide to raise money for a hospital with their annual calendar.  The only catch?  These well-aged women are going to pose in the buff with strategically placed items of household drudgery hiding the naughty bits and pieces.  And when the calendar comes out?  They all have to deal with the infamy that comes along with posing nude.  And deal with success as well!  Or new found confidence.It is a story rich dramatically and still just plain funny.  The nudity is tasteful, and not all that revealing.  Think Dianne Keaton's SOMETHINGS GOT TO GIVE flash, and you get the idea.  And Helen Mirren and a STRONG cast give it all a dignified English air that plays well.  I really loved this movie.  It made me smile widely!  And hammered home the message that beauty is in ALL forms.

When her best friend's husband dies of leukemia she devises a plan to raise money for the hospital where he died, to help furnish the waiting room making it more comfortable for the grieving family.  The plan is for their annual calendar (they belong to NWI or National Women's Institute).  Every year they do a calendar, usually with flowers and churches and such, but this year Chris suggests doing a nude calendar, starring of course the women belonging to the NWI (all in their fifties or older), in order to cause a stir and sell more calendars (most likely out of pure curiosity).  At first her idea is baulked at but eventually it's allowed and they raise more money then they could have dreamed...and they become more famous then they would have expected...but with fame comes a price, and that price may be their friendship.

I was not sure whether the setting was in Great Britain or Ireland although it does appear to have been filmed almost entirely on location in the British isles, with the exception of the Hollywood, California scenes towards the end of the movie.  The scripting of the film is not typical Hollywood fare.  It has all the sense of British writing and humor, which helps make this film an immense success in my book.  It is laced with a balance of sophisticated wit and cheap humor.  The plot is slow but well justified since it gives way to excellent development of the main characters.  The audience, even an American one, can identify with each of them and with the small-town issues they face.In a nutshell, a women's club is gathering to discuss what will be the promotional thrust of their organization for the coming year.  The husband of one of the main characters is near death with cancer.  While in the waiting room of a rural hospital the women notice how run-down the waiting room furniture is and the overall condition of the hospital.  They decide to raise funds for new hospital furniture by finding sponsors for a homemade calendar.  But there's a wild twist...twelve of the women, all middle-aged or elderly, decide to pose nude for the calendar.  This sends the head of their organization and many of its members into outrage, but the women press forward and do it anyway.  What follows is unexpected success and popularity not only in England, but also in the United States where the women are invited to meet with Jay Leno on The Tonight Show.  Alas success does come with a price and the women are faced with moral and family dilemas which are not easily put to rest.Calendar Girls is a fun romantic celebration of middle aged women, their contirbutions as wives, mothers, and vital contributing members of their communities, and also a celebration of their beauty.  This film is not for everyone!  Not because of graphic depictions (there really are none) but because of the mature adult subject matter which is not likely to intrigue anyone but mature, cultured adults with a few years under their belt.  Younger audiences who are interested in foreign films and artful dramas are also likely to enjoy Calendar Girls.  If, however, you are looking for a nudie-movie look somewhere else.  You will be sorely disappointed.  I, however, will grab this disc quick and store it next to my treasured ""Amelie"" disc.  Mature ladies, be proud of who you are and of your timeless beauty.

They huddled amongst themselves, thinking: ""Hmm, how about a bake sale, to help raise funds for the Women's Institute, to assist women with health-related and other similar issues?"". The gals thought about this, and said to themselves: ""No, too commonplace, and too much manpower."". Then, they came up with a second scheme, and thought: ""Hey, how about a concert, where we sing and dance for our charitable supper?"". Huddling amongst themselves, they pondered: ""Uh-uh, too far out and going too far off the deep end. Besides, none of us can neither sing or dance, and who would come to our little shindig?"". Finally, hitting the collective nail squarely on its head, they arrived at the perfect solution, and came up with: ""A-ha! How about we pose nude, and put our middle-aged nude bodies on a series of calendars to benefit the Women's Institute?"". To which one of the debonair British ladies replied: ""By jove, I think she's got it!"". Nearly everyone in the quaint English village of Skipton thinks this is a modestly great idea, except the ladies' husbands, who take to the local pub the way a fish takes to water, and absolutely drink their troubles away, while the gals scatter the countryside profiling and styling, while at the same time looking for potential buyers to distribute their ""Playboy cousin"" 'masterpiece'. After modest and partially successful sales in their native country, the gals take off to the good ole U.S. of A., where they land a spot on national television (the ""Tonight Show""). Jay Leno has a brief guest cameo, and even seems both joyful and elated over the gals' success. What's also surprising, is the gals' reaction of surprise, when they learn their airline tickets have been upgraded to first-class status when they depart from Heathrow Airport in London (Gee, you'd think they'd never travelled first-class before, let alone stay in a ritzy hotel [which they do in Los Angeles]). However, what's not surprising, is the lighthearted humor and first-rate dramatics the entire cast (male and female) brings to the film's script and screenplay.

Rather than being laden with jokes, the characters and their situations provide the humour here. The main appeal of the film is the incongruity of a group of middle-aged ladies making a nude calendar for their Women's Institute with the hope of raising maybe 1,000. Although the characters and their personalstories have been changed, this is based on a true story, and the ladies involved in the making of the real 'Alternative W.I. Calendar' gave their approval to the script (and even appear in a cameo as members of a rival town's W.I. group!). As well as fund-raising, the calendar has had two other important effects. It has modernised the image of the Women's Institute, thought for years to be rather old-fashioned, and helped alter people'sconceptions about the acceptability of older people's bodies. The film uses older actresses Julie Walters, Annette Crosbie, and Helen Mirren (and one younger, Celia Imrie) who laudably went topless for the photo shoot scenes.In real life, the calendars were a runaway success and have together with other linked efforts now made over half a million pounds to combat Leukaemia, but what will happen in the film? Will their efforts be defeated by family objections, administrative obstacles, lack of sponsorship, or jealousy? Watch and find out.The DVD is rather mean with extras, but the Naked Truth is a reasonable well made promotional type making-of feature, and a very short short (under seven minutes) Making Of the Calendar shows how the actresses were photographed to make the mock-ups of the calendars seen in the movie. There are four deletedscenes which total about five minutes. I would have thought a director's commentary could have been included, and perhaps some more background on the differences between the real story and the movie, and something about the different locations (the Yorkshire countryside shown in the film is wonderful).",5,What a brilliant film!,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,1962,"['very', 'funny', 'way', 'only', 'British', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'Rather', 'being', 'laden', 'jokes', 'characters', 'situations', 'provide', 'humour', 'here', 'main', 'appeal', 'film', 'incongruity', 'group', 'middle-aged', 'ladies', 'making', 'nude', 'calendar', 'Women', 'Institute', 'hope', 'raising', 'maybe', '1,000', 'characters', 'personalstories', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'ladies', 'involved', 'making', 'real', ""'Alternative"", 'W.I', 'Calendar', 'gave', 'approval', 'script', 'even', 'appear', 'cameo', 'members', 'rival', 'town', 'W.I', 'group', 'As', 'well', 'fund-raising', 'calendar', 'had', 'two', 'other', 'important', 'effects', 'modernised', 'image', 'Women', 'Institute', 'thought', 'years', 'be', 'rather', 'old-fashioned', 'helped', 'alter', ""people'sconceptions"", 'acceptability', 'older', 'people', 'bodies', 'film', 'older', 'actresses', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Annette', 'Crosbie', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'one', 'younger', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'who', 'laudably', 'went', 'topless', 'photo', 'shoot', 'scenes.In', 'real', 'life', 'calendars', 'were', 'runaway', 'success', 'have', 'together', 'other', 'linked', 'efforts', 'now', 'made', 'million', 'pounds', 'combat', 'Leukaemia', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'film', 'Will', 'efforts', 'be', 'defeated', 'family', 'objections', 'administrative', 'obstacles', 'lack', 'sponsorship', 'jealousy', 'Watch', 'find', 'out.The', 'DVD', 'rather', 'mean', 'extras', 'Naked', 'Truth', 'reasonable', 'well', 'made', 'promotional', 'type', 'making-of', 'feature', 'very', 'short', 'short', 'seven', 'minutes', 'Making', 'Calendar', 'how', 'actresses', 'were', 'photographed', 'make', 'mock-ups', 'calendars', 'seen', 'movie', 'are', 'four', 'deletedscenes', 'total', 'five', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'director', 'commentary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'perhaps', 'more', 'background', 'differences', 'real', 'story', 'movie', 'something', 'different', 'locations', 'Yorkshire', 'countryside', 'shown', 'film', 'wonderful']",N/A

One, I love British humor and two, I love the idea of 50-something women posing nude for a calendar.  I love challenging our views on what constitutes female beauty.However, this British comedy wasn't all that funny.  There were only a couple of laughs.  My favorite line came from the wife who catches her husband cheating on her.  But the fact that her husband was cheating, though, was predictable and her joke - while clever - was ruined by the overacting of the cheating husband and mistress that followed.There wasn't much depth to this story either.  And that's a shame because the storylines could've been taken much further, but never were.For instance, we have the son who's upset that his mom's posing nude for a calendar.  We could've explored his feelings but instead, the dad tells him to get over it and we move on.  We could've explored the marriage of the betrayed wife but instead, we get a clever oneliner and move on.  We could've explored the husband's feelings about being in the tabloids but instead we get a few catch phrases from him and move on.Exploring these issues further could've made this movie more compelling to watch.  And then to have dry British humor mixed in for comic relief would've been icing on the cake.  But instead, the movie moves painfully slow and goes for the easy, cute laughs.  And as a result, I didn't feel attached to any of these characters and didn't care what happened to them.I gave this movie two stars, though, because I thought the calendar was very tastefully done.  You don't see any nipples or V-parts.  Instead, you see black and white photos that highlight their unique beauty and playfulness.In the end, though, I was expecting a much sassier and much funnier movie and was disappointed the story didn't push further than it could have.",2,"I really wanted to like this, but didn't",1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,1931,"['Seeing', 'trailor', 'seeing', 'how', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'movie', 'received', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'movie', 'One', 'love', 'British', 'humor', 'two', 'love', 'idea', '50-something', 'women', 'posing', 'nude', 'calendar', 'love', 'challenging', 'views', 'what', 'female', 'beauty.However', 'British', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'were', 'only', 'couple', 'laughs', 'favorite', 'line', 'came', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'cheating', 'fact', 'husband', 'was', 'cheating', 'though', 'was', 'predictable', 'joke', 'clever', 'was', 'ruined', 'overacting', 'cheating', 'husband', 'mistress', 'followed.There', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'depth', 'story', 'shame', 'storylines', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taken', 'much', 'further', 'never', 'were.For', 'instance', 'have', 'son', 'who', 'upset', 'mom', 'posing', 'nude', 'calendar', 'could', ""'ve"", 'explored', 'feelings', 'instead', 'dad', 'get', 'move', 'could', ""'ve"", 'explored', 'marriage', 'betrayed', 'wife', 'instead', 'get', 'clever', 'oneliner', 'move', 'could', ""'ve"", 'explored', 'husband', 'feelings', 'being', 'tabloids', 'instead', 'get', 'few', 'catch', 'phrases', 'move', 'on.Exploring', 'issues', 'further', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'compelling', 'watch', 'then', 'have', 'dry', 'British', 'humor', 'mixed', 'comic', 'relief', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'icing', 'cake', 'instead', 'movie', 'painfully', 'slow', 'easy', 'cute', 'laughs', 'result', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'attached', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'them.I', 'gave', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'though', 'thought', 'calendar', 'was', 'very', 'tastefully', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'nipples', 'V-parts', 'Instead', 'see', 'black', 'white', 'photos', 'highlight', 'unique', 'beauty', 'playfulness.In', 'end', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'sassier', 'much', 'funnier', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointed', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'push', 'further', 'could', 'have']",N/A

806269,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0001I55M4,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","It seems that British cinema has fallen into a rut, at least where comedy is concerned: like numerous other films of the past decade or so, CALENDAR GIRLS combines a touch of mischief, a touch of sex, a lot of ""lets feel good,"" and a ""let's root for the underdog"" plot. But if the formula has become commonplace, it can still receive new life from a clever script and a fine cast--and such is the case with CALENDAR GIRLS, a film loosely based on actual events surrounding a British women's club who created a semi-nude calendar to raise money for a lukemia clinic.  The trick, both in real life and in the film, is that the ladies in question are well into their fifties, sixties, and even beyond.Annie and John (Julie Walters and John Alderton) are a happily married couple until John is stricken with lukemia.  While waiting at the hospital, both Annie and her best friend Chris (Helen Mirren) become aware of how uncomfortable the furniture in the family waiting room is--a trivial point--but when John dies, and Annie wants to raise money for new furniture, Chris has a brainstorm: the women's club will produce a calendar showing various local ladies in semi-nude but tastefully concealed poses.  At first Annie and Chris have difficulty finding women who will agree to the photo shoot, but the idea takes off, even when the president of the ladies' club opposes it.  Soon the ladies are all giggling in bathrobes as they prepare to pose with essential parts concealed behind cream buns, apple presses, tea pots, and the like.Unfortunately, the results of the calendar's success are not entirely happy.  Chris experiences considerable difficulty with both her husband, who feels neglected, and her son, who feels embarassed.  Annie begins to feel that the business side of the project and its success has made Chris less concerned about the actual point of the project; Chris accuses Annie of being a self-indulgent martyr.  One of the women, Ruth (Penelope Wilton), is attacked for her participation in the project by her husband--and she subsequently finds he has been having an affair behind her back for quite some time.  For the most part, however, everyone takes it in good fun, with the highly formal Jessie (Annette Crosbie) a case in point, her husband bemused and she herself enjoying the experience greatly.This being a comedy, of course, most of the differences are made up by the time the credts roll--although the film does leave a few loose ends, particularly in relationship to Chris' son and the group's visit to Hollywood.  But even with these story gaps, CALENDAR GIRLS succeeds in being charming, flyweight fun from start to finish.

Helen Mirren and Julie Walters lead the ladies (and gents) through this daring play on Playboy Calendars and manage to make a truly believable case for the pulchritude  of our heroines.  Along the way Director Nigel Cole pauses for subtle statements about infidelity, mistresses, teenage drug use/abuse, death, and Hollywood commercialism.

A manifesto about England and its Women's Academy that has to open up women's concerns and initiatives onto the modern world and onto real feminity which is both spiritual and physical. A manifesto about charity : to  levy  money by using the market and not the state in order to improve services and health research. A manifesto about death and how to cope with it when it touches you closely. A manifesto about women and their relationship within a society that has merchandized everything and that bases its merchandizing on the lowest instincts and pulses in men essentially but also in women. A manifesto about liberating women, mature women of their complexes and their total jailing in a vision from the old centuries when women were supposed - but were they really ? - to be limited to broccoli, cauly-flower, plum jam, swiss cakes and other kitchen inventivity, creativity and slavery. A manifesto finally about young people, young boys particularly, teenagers at that, who practice the old pornography at night and in the dark and then hide it under their beds. When things are pushed into the open, they cannot cope, they have a problem. For them sex is supposed to be illegal and hidden. For them sensuality is supposed to be reduced to voyeurism in the night between their sheets and their legs. And that is a real crisis for a teenager when his mother decides to go public about her mature nudity. In other words, these women are telling us that the world has to cope with nudity AGAIN and in a responsible way : nudity is beautiful, not only because of the photographer but also because nudity is the natural state of men and women, the anthem of life and material existence we need in this world of virtual voyeurism.

What made the venture unusual was that the models were all just local ladies in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. In the UK, 88,000 copies were eventually sold, and 250,000 in the States. CALENDAR GIRLS, based on this story, has been characterized by a principal as about 75% accurate in the re-telling, with the remainder being scriptwriter's embellishment for comedic or dramatic effect. The original idea for the calendar was suggested by Angela's friend, Tricia Stewart.In the film adaptation, Helen Mirren plays Chris Harper (based on real-life Tricia Stewart) and Julie Walters and John Alderton play Annie and John Clark respectively (based on Angela and John Baker). The calendar saga, from conception to realization and international fame, is centered in the fictional village of Knapley. Harper originally gets the idea after 1) finding a soft porn magazine hidden in her teenage son's room and 2) noticing a girlie calendar on the wall of a village shop. The plan is to produce and sell 500 copies of the calendar to raise the 900 pounds necessary to buy a new sofa for the Relatives' Waiting Room in the local hospital in which John Clark died of his disease. Not only must Chris and Annie surmount the understandable reluctance of their friends and fellow WI members to pose nude (not &quot;naked&quot;), but also convince the chairwomen of the District and National WI that the reputation of the organization won't be sullied.There is, of course, some nudity in the film, but, as on the calendar itself, it's discreetly done. The naughty bits are strategically hidden by sticky buns, flowering plants, and such. But enough of Helen Mirren is seen for the viewer to realize that physical beauty and maturity of &quot;that certain age&quot; are not mutually incompatible.Though the script touches on such sober subjects as teenage drug use and spousal infidelity, the film as a whole is delightfully witty, charming, warm, and poignant. And then there are the beautiful Yorkshire towns and fells in which the movie was shot. Is this one of the year's best films? No. Is it a great cinematic achievement? No again.

The idea is to raise enough funds to purchase a new sofa for the leukemia wing at the local hospital. How about pulling a twist on the same boring idea of the annual calendar... and have a nude picture of a housewife for each month, while tending to the everyday chores. From a marketing standpoint, the idea is simply brilliant. But the real achievement of these ""calendar girls"" does not just lie in the fact that they stripped for a good cause during their middle age (although that would have been good enough, especially for actresses with a body like Helen Mirren's), but in the actual originality of their idea.This is a great movie because it portrays a true story of courage and determination, in which real people command the attention of the world by doing something uncommon. Additionally, and as one of the previous reviews stated, Helen Mirren's and Julie Walters' elegance, brings a special, cozy touch to this typical ""girls' movie"".The setting is wonderful, with charming views of the British countryside.

806291,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0001I55M4,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 1]","In the western society, ageism is becoming more prominent as people fear growing old and miracle nip and tuck solutions are steadily growing.  TV shows and commercials spew out an abundance of messages of staying fit and healthy, which is often related to youth.  In times such as these it is essential that people are enlightened that maturing is a normal and healthy aspect of life.  The film Calendar Girls does a brilliant job getting this message across to the audience as women in their 50s and older undress in front of a photographer for the good cause of fighting leukemia.The story takes place in a small town in Northern Yorkshire where the Women's Institute (WI) holds regular meetings that often consist of some slumber-inducing lecture.  Two of the WI members are best friends, Chris (Helen Mirren) and Annie (Julie Walter), who attend the meeting just to get away from home.  Not that the women don't like their home life--they just do so in order to get away and gossip.  However, when Annie's husband, John (John Alderton), discovers that he has leukemia, which also leads to his unfortunate death, it changes everything at the WI.John's departure changes the perspective on life for Annie, and also for Chris who comes up with the idea of making a unique calendar in honor of John.  The calendar is to have the theme of a sunflower, which was John's favorite flower as he described it as a satellite dish that sought sunshine.  The satellite is an analogy for life and what was important to John.  This is what the women want to capture through the calendar as they decide that they will undress in the honor of John.Nudity is often something that is considered dirty, naughty, and often is the reason for a film to get a stricter rating by the MPAA here in the United States.  However, in many European nations nudity is often consider normal and cultured, as it does not affect the rating in a harsh manner as long as the nudity is projected in a natural manner.  For example, a natural manner would be such as a taking a shower without sexual meaning.  Calendar Girls has some similarities with Full Monty (1997) and one of these similarities would be the decent manner of depicting nudity.  Here, the nudity is natural as the women struggle with their own awkward feelings about it, but the photographer is the one who feels the most awkward.Calendar Girls is a warm and caring comedy by the director Nigel Cole who is not foreign to depicting mature women as his heroines.  In Saving Grace (2000) Cole depicted a middle-aged woman finding a financial solution through growing Marijuana in her house.  This time Cole brings a film based on a true story where 11 women made a calendar in order to raise money for a hospital.  The cast also provides a solid performance, which is to be expected from skilled actors such as Helen Mirren and Julie Walkers among others.  Despite some similarities with other films Cole succeeds in directing a unique story with several subplots that holds the audience's interest while being amusing and contemplative.",5,"A Contemplative, Warm and Caring Comedy...",1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,3069,"['western', 'society', 'ageism', 'becoming', 'more', 'prominent', 'people', 'fear', 'growing', 'old', 'miracle', 'nip', 'tuck', 'solutions', 'are', 'steadily', 'growing', 'TV', 'shows', 'commercials', 'spew', 'out', 'abundance', 'messages', 'staying', 'fit', 'healthy', 'often', 'related', 'youth', 'times', 'such', 'essential', 'people', 'are', 'enlightened', 'maturing', 'normal', 'healthy', 'aspect', 'life', 'film', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'brilliant', 'job', 'getting', 'message', 'audience', 'women', '50s', 'older', 'undress', 'front', 'photographer', 'good', 'cause', 'fighting', 'leukemia.The', 'story', 'place', 'small', 'town', 'Northern', 'Yorkshire', 'where', 'Women', 'Institute', 'WI', 'regular', 'meetings', 'often', 'consist', 'slumber-inducing', 'lecture', 'Two', 'WI', 'members', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'Chris', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Annie', 'Julie', 'Walter', 'who', 'attend', 'meeting', 'just', 'get', 'away', 'home', 'Not', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'home', 'life', 'just', 'do', 'so', 'order', 'get', 'away', 'gossip', 'However', 'when', 'Annie', 'husband', 'John', 'John', 'Alderton', 'leukemia', 'also', 'unfortunate', 'death', 'everything', 'WI.John', 'departure', 'perspective', 'life', 'Annie', 'also', 'Chris', 'who', 'up', 'idea', 'making', 'unique', 'calendar', 'honor', 'John', 'calendar', 'have', 'theme', 'sunflower', 'was', 'John', 'favorite', 'flower', 'described', 'satellite', 'dish', 'sought', 'sunshine', 'satellite', 'analogy', 'life', 'what', 'was', 'important', 'John', 'what', 'women', 'want', 'capture', 'calendar', 'decide', 'will', 'undress', 'honor', 'John.Nudity', 'often', 'something', 'considered', 'dirty', 'naughty', 'often', 'reason', 'film', 'get', 'stricter', 'rating', 'MPAA', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'However', 'many', 'European', 'nations', 'nudity', 'often', 'consider', 'normal', 'cultured', 'not', 'affect', 'rating', 'harsh', 'manner', 'as', 'long', 'nudity', 'projected', 'natural', 'manner', 'example', 'natural', 'manner', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'taking', 'shower', 'sexual', 'meaning', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'similarities', 'Full', 'Monty', '1997', 'one', 'similarities', 'would', 'be', 'decent', 'manner', 'depicting', 'nudity', 'Here', 'nudity', 'natural', 'women', 'struggle', 'own', 'awkward', 'feelings', 'photographer', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'awkward.Calendar', 'Girls', 'warm', 'caring', 'comedy', 'director', 'Nigel', 'Cole', 'who', 'not', 'foreign', 'depicting', 'mature', 'women', 'heroines', 'Saving', 'Grace', '2000', 'Cole', 'depicted', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'finding', 'financial', 'solution', 'growing', 'Marijuana', 'house', 'time', 'Cole', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'where', '11', 'women', 'made', 'calendar', 'order', 'raise', 'money', 'hospital', 'cast', 'also', 'solid', 'performance', 'be', 'expected', 'skilled', 'actors', 'such', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Julie', 'Walkers', 'others', 'similarities', 'other', 'films', 'Cole', 'directing', 'unique', 'story', 'several', 'subplots', 'audience', 'interest', 'being', 'amusing', 'contemplative']",N/A

When Annie's beloved husband dies from cancer, some of the club members decide to raise money for a new sofa in the hospital waiting room by selling a calendar featuring themselves in the (gasp!) nude.Helen Miren is great as the feisty and opinionated Chris, whose involvement alienates her family.  Julie Walters is very likeable and sympathetic as the new widow.  Ciaran Hinds, who has starred in many period films, has a small but good role as Chris' husband.Most of the movie is beautifully photographed in rural England and it is simply idyllic.  This is in sharp contrast to the unsavory scenes filmed in Hollywood (when the ladies appear on The Tonight Show.)  The story is heartwarming, but avoids being syrupy.  The nude scenes are tastefully done, and played for laughs, as one would expect.  The real calendar, by the way, has so far raised $1.6M for a new cancer hospital wing (and the new sofa).

After all, we are talking middle-aged naked English people.  But if &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; is less satisfying than &quot;The Full Monty&quot; it is because there are some problems with the final act of the film and not because we think we have seen it all before.The focus in on best friends Annie Clarke (Julie Walters) and Chris Harper (Helen Mirren), who have to endure the boring weekly meetings of their local Women's Institute where they learn all about the joys of broccoli.  However, such concerns become trivial with Annie's husband, John (John Alderton), is diagnosed with leukemia.  They try everything they can at the local hospital, but in the end John dies.  One thing Annie remembers is something that John said before the end: &quot;The flowers of Yorkshire are like the women of Yorkshire. Every stage of their growth has its own beauty, but the last phase is always the most glorious. Then very quickly they all go to seed.&quot;Annie wants to honor John's memory by raising money to support leukemia research or to at least get a decent sofa for the room at the hospital where she spend so many of John's last days, but it is Chris who comes up with the idea of raising money by having members of the WI pose &quot;nude&quot; for a calendar (&quot;nude&quot; is naked but with art thrown in).  Chris will be January and Annie will be February, and Jessie (Annette Crosby), Cora (Linda Bassett), Celia (Celia Imrie), and a few others volunteer for the other months and to provide each other with the support it will take for them to go through with this.  The ladies are surprised that their calendar becomes not merely a local success, but a national and international one as well.  You would think that this might be the climax of the film, but there is more to come, and that is where &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; gets off track.The calendar is a success because the photographs are indeed art.  My favorites were Miss July, where we see none of the &quot;naughty bits,&quot; but the curve of the woman from her neck to her hip, and the one of the meeting where every figure except one is seen from the back, sitting in a chair, wearing their best hats.  Actually, the photographs in the film are less risqu&eacute; than those that appeared in the original calendar, a few of which you can see in one of the bonus features.  As for the stars, Helen Mirren appears behind an apple press pressing apples (ah, the Freudian implications) while Julie Walters is playing the piano au natural.Everything up to the ladies reaching the heights of their success is pretty good, but then the film starts getting into downside of the experience without really deciding what point it is trying to make.  &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; is not really about naked bodies but about self-expression and female empowerment, so when it decides to go off in yet another direction without clear rhyme or reason, I am not inclined to follow along.The real calendar had an initial print run of 500 copies, which quickly sold out, and eventually the ladies of Yorkshire raise more than half-a-million pounds for a local hospital.  That reality helps to forgive those parts of &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; that try to turn the 2003 film from director Nigel Cole into something more profound than what it is: a nice little true story that deserves to be celebrated.",4,The movie is not quite as good as the idea for the calendar,1084147200,"05 10, 2004",2004,3593,"['quot', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'quot', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'group', 'middle-aged', 'women', 'Yorkshire', 'who', 'posed', 'nude', 'calendar', 'not', 'simply', 'female', 'counterpart', 'quot', 'Full', 'Monty', 'quot', 'comparisons', 'are', 'inevitable', 'are', 'talking', 'middle-aged', 'naked', 'English', 'people', 'quot', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'quot', 'less', 'satisfying', 'quot', 'Full', 'Monty', 'quot', 'are', 'problems', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'not', 'think', 'have', 'seen', 'before.The', 'focus', 'best', 'friends', 'Annie', 'Clarke', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Chris', 'Harper', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'who', 'have', 'endure', 'boring', 'weekly', 'meetings', 'local', 'Women', 'Institute', 'where', 'learn', 'joys', 'broccoli', 'However', 'such', 'concerns', 'become', 'trivial', 'Annie', 'husband', 'John', 'John', 'Alderton', 'diagnosed', 'leukemia', 'try', 'everything', 'can', 'local', 'hospital', 'end', 'John', 'One', 'thing', 'Annie', 'remembers', 'something', 'John', 'said', 'end', 'quot', 'flowers', 'Yorkshire', 'are', 'women', 'Yorkshire', 'Every', 'stage', 'growth', 'own', 'beauty', 'last', 'phase', 'always', 'most', 'glorious', 'Then', 'very', 'quickly', 'go', 'seed.', 'quot', 'Annie', 'honor', 'John', 'memory', 'raising', 'money', 'support', 'leukemia', 'research', 'least', 'get', 'decent', 'sofa', 'room', 'hospital', 'where', 'spend', 'so', 'many', 'John', 'last', 'days', 'Chris', 'who', 'up', 'idea', 'raising', 'money', 'having', 'members', 'WI', 'pose', 'quot', 'quot', 'calendar', 'quot', 'quot', 'naked', 'art', 'thrown', 'Chris', 'will', 'be', 'January', 'Annie', 'will', 'be', 'February', 'Jessie', 'Annette', 'Crosby', 'Cora', 'Linda', 'Bassett', 'Celia', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'few', 'others', 'volunteer', 'other', 'months', 'provide', 'other', 'support', 'will', 'take', 'go', 'ladies', 'are', 'surprised', 'calendar', 'not', 'merely', 'local', 'success', 'national', 'international', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'climax', 'film', 'more', 'come', 'where', 'quot', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'quot', 'track.The', 'calendar', 'success', 'photographs', 'are', 'indeed', 'art', 'favorites', 'were', 'Miss', 'July', 'where', 'see', 'none', 'quot', 'bits', 'quot', 'curve', 'woman', 'neck', 'hip', 'one', 'meeting', 'where', 'figure', 'one', 'seen', 'back', 'sitting', 'chair', 'wearing', 'best', 'hats', 'Actually', 'photographs', 'film', 'are', 'less', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'appeared', 'original', 'calendar', 'few', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'bonus', 'features', 'stars', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'apple', 'press', 'pressing', 'apples', 'ah', 'Freudian', 'implications', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'playing', 'piano', 'au', 'natural.Everything', 'up', 'ladies', 'reaching', 'heights', 'success', 'pretty', 'good', 'then', 'film', 'getting', 'downside', 'experience', 'really', 'deciding', 'what', 'point', 'trying', 'make', 'quot', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'quot', 'not', 'really', 'naked', 'bodies', 'self-expression', 'female', 'empowerment', 'so', 'when', 'go', 'off', 'yet', 'direction', 'clear', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'am', 'not', 'inclined', 'follow', 'along.The', 'real', 'calendar', 'had', 'initial', 'print', 'run', '500', 'copies', 'quickly', 'sold', 'out', 'eventually', 'ladies', 'Yorkshire', 'raise', 'more', 'half-a-million', 'pounds', 'local', 'hospital', 'reality', 'forgive', 'parts', 'quot', 'Calendar', 'Girls', 'quot', 'try', 'turn', '2003', 'film', 'director', 'Nigel', 'Cole', 'something', 'more', 'profound', 'what', 'nice', 'little', 'true', 'story', 'be', 'celebrated']",N/A

From the stodgy weekly W.I. meetings to the globe trotting gals with a cause, the story of Chris and Annie will truly show why we do the things we do for those we love.Based on a true story, these women brought art and humor to what is traditionally a difficult time. After Annie lost her brave husband to leukemia, she and Chris set out to make a difference for those who will have to face the same in the future. Told from the point of view of Chris, who masterminds the photo shoots, press releases and gives a stirring speech in front of the congress of the W.I., Helen Mirren delivers a top notch performance that will have you rooting for the girls in no time.There comes to be a bit of a rift that the celebrity status the women gain to those who chose to be on the calendar. In the small town in England where they live, many people shook their heads and said the most unpleasant things. As we all know this can be difficult on families and we see the bond the women have to help triumph the greater cause while coming together to support one another.I must also mention the bonus material on the dvd. It includes interviews with the real women and some background on the calendar that the film was unable to cover. The material is very well done and adds a delightful bonus to see the actual women that brought this all together.The performances in this film were excellent and the English countryside that we are treated to as the ladies do their Tai Chi is breathtaking.

Based on a true story, Calendar Girls is the story of a group of members from a somewhat starch-collared dried-up women's fellowship club deciding to raise money to buy a comfy couch for the relatives room at the local hospital (where one of the club members husbands recently died from leukemia). Rest of the review is in the extended entry.In previous years, they had done calendars with pictures of cakes, jams, flowers, etc - those calendars netted less than 100 pounds profit. They needed to do something different this year. Something that would make some money.They are inspired by the dying husbands speech he had written to give at a future club meeting::::: ""The flowers of Yorkshire are like the women of Yorkshire. Every stage of their growth has its own beauty, but the last phase is always the most glorious ... Then very quickly they all go to seed."" ::::One of the women comes up with the idea of doing an arty-nude calendar - the catch being that all the women are in their later years and all their ""bits"" are covered with buns, watering cans, knitting needles, or their choir books.The ensuing story is hilarious as the husbands find out what their wives are up to, the photographer is chosen, the actual photo-shoot takes place (who could forget ... ""We're going to need considerably bigger buns""!), one of the women's children getting caught smoking a joint (of oregano!), and of course when the media finds out - it gets crazy!We see the women blossom ... friendships are strengthened ... and LOTS of money is raised for leukemia research (approximately 1 million American dollars) and of course for the new couch in the hospital waiting room.It's a feel good movie - it will have you laughing, crying and thinking about whats really important in life!

Annie's Husband John is a nice chap who develops leukemia.  Annie and her family and Chris spend a fair amount of time at the hospital waiting on an uncomfortable sofa - the kind of sofa that matches a hospital waiting room with magazines spread out from years past.The Women's Institute does a calendar every year - usually on some agricultural theme.  When John passes away Annie and Chris get the idea to do a different calendar.  They want to take tasteful nude photos of themselves and make this the new WI Calendar.  Any proceeds they plan to use to replace the worn out old sofa at the hospital.The Calendar becomes a huge hit, sells tens of thousands of copies, and suddenly the 50-something homebodies are juggling their previous domestic lives along with reporters and offers from Hollywood.  The narrative conflict begins in the second act as the families feel neglected and the women begin to have a little friction (Annie, who has just lost John, thinks that Chris is shamefully neglecting her still-living husband.) The third act feels a little rushed. There are many movies that are made a little loooooong, but this film wraps up as if the writer, director and editor looked down at their watches and said ""well, we've only got ten minutes left, lads, better wrap things up!""  Things are wrapped up - and pleasantly - so I recommend this movie.

In her sweet careworn face we witness the love and care with which she gives us her character.  The entire supporting cast is a delight to watch as well. I would love to single them all out but I will leave their charms for you to discover on your own.On The DVD are a couple of mini-documentaries about the real Calendar Girls.

806310,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0001I55M4,mirasreviews,"[15, 17]","&quot;Calendar Girls&quot; is a fictionalized account of the events surrounding the publication, in 1999, of a nude calendar featuring the ladies of the Rylstone Women's Institute of North Yorkshire, England. The calendar caused a media sensation in Great Britain and the United States on account of its photographs of women of a certain age performing quaint everyday tasks in the buff. In the film, Chris (Helen Mirren) organizes the calendar to raise money on behalf of her best friend Annie's (Julie Waters) husband, who is dying of leukemia. &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; dramatizes the challenges of convincing a group of middle-aged and older women to pose nude, garnering support for the project, and coping with the resulting flood of international publicity.The cast is well-suited to their roles. The characters are all appealing. But &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; takes too much time to get off the ground and moves very slowly once it does. This &quot;dramedy&quot; isn't nearly as funny as it should be. It's just bland. The story of the WI calendar is really more interesting than this film.As for &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; accuracy, this really is a fictionalized account. The characters do not represent real people specifically, except for Chris and Annie, who are based loosely on real women. Any strife between characters in the film is dramatic license. The calendar's photographer was not a stranger, but one of the ladies' husbands. The calendar was indeed intended to raise money for a local hospital's cancer ward on behalf of Angela Baker's husband, John Baker, to whose memory &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; is dedicated. And a similar 2004 calendar featuring the actresses in this film has been released as a further fund-raiser for charity.The DVD: Bonus features include two mini-documentaries and four deleted scenes. &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; is a 15-minute documentary about the real story behind the infamous calendar. It features interviews with the women who organized and graced the pages of the calendar and its photographer, following the calendar's story from its genesis to this film's premiere. &quot;Creating the Calendar&quot; is a 6-minute short about filming the nude scenes and photographing the calendar for the movie.

Annie spends many days and nights in the local hospital as her husband is getting treatment, suffering on a lumpy sofa in an unglamorous waiting room. When her husband dies, she is determined to do some charity work to provide a better family room for other families that have to undergo the same experience.It is her friend Chris, slightly eccentric and known for her ""crazy ideas"" who takes up her cause and storms full speed ahead with it. Both are members of the local Women's Institute, a national organization for women that usually deals with cupcakes and gardening tips. In one of the meetings, the president of the WI decides that this year's calendar should feature local churches.It is not until later that Chris realizes that a better way to raise money for charity is by making the calendar more interesting. Inspired by the calendar of semi-nude (not naked!) girls hanging in the local bicycle repairman's shop, Chris realizes that she and the other women need to take things one step further. With her usual enthusiasm and deterministic nature, Chris convinces half a dozen women to show their bodies for a local photographer to make the calendar.The movie is touching and both bitter sweet and hilarious. One of John's last speeches to his wife refers to the sunflower and how Yorkshire women are like them, because each stage is better than the last. The sunflower features on the calendars.Chris is keen to make the calendar a success, so that enough money can be raised, but the overwhelming response to her press releases come as a massive surprise to her and the other women, when the national news stations get wind of the story that takes the women all the way to Hollywood.Not everything is a success, however. We witness deterioration of a marriage, the sleazy behavior of news reporters, and a son's demise into drug use - all peripherals to the main story. The mix of fifty-something nudes and traditional British country side events is funny, offbeat, and incredibly well acted by some of the best British celebs.Generally a feel-good film, with plenty of laughter and real-life drama.

Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","If you don't have a smile on your face by the time the credits for this film start rolling, then there may be something seriously wrong with you. This is a movie about all the best things in life: friendship, love and being naked. Based on a true story, ""Calendar Girls"" centers on the friendship of vivacious Chris (Helen Mirren) and the more reserved Annie (Julie Walters), both women in their fifties and both members of the Women's Institute. There they sit for hours every week in the town hall of their little English village of Napley, listening to talks on the milk industry, carpeting, broccoli and slide-shows of other people's holidays. They're bored out of their wits, but remain out of loyalty to each other and promises made to their mothers.But then Annie's life is turned around when her husband John is diagnosed with Leukemia. Chris and the rest of the Women's Institute rush to support their friend, but it's only a matter of time before he passes away. It's at that point that Chris comes up with one of her famous ideas. Inspired by the words of a speech that she had encouraged John to make to the W.I.: ""the flowers of Yorkshire are like the women of Yorkshire - the last phase is always the most glorious,"" as well as a girly magazine that she finds under her son's bed and a playboy calendar hanging on the wall of the local garage, Chris proposes an idea to Annie. In order to raise enough money to buy a more comfortable couch for the resident's room in the local hospital, why don't they pose nude for the annual W.I. calendar?The idea takes off. Soon Chris and Annie have talked several other women into joining their project, insisting that they'll be ""nude"", not ""naked"" and that a professional photographer will ensure that it's art, not pornography. There are plenty of obstacles to hurdle: a prudish chairwomen, the need for sponsorship, and the nerves of the women themselves, but once they've hired a sympathetic photographer who worked as an orderly at the hospital whilst John was sick, the women gather together to drop their dressing gowns and pose behind various fruits, cakes, watering cans, knitting, pianos and plants.I trust it isn't a spoiler to say that the calendar is a runaway hit (you wouldn't be watching a film about it if it wasn't), but the story certainly doesn't end there and it's not totally light-hearted. The story doesn't shy away from the darker side of the fame that comes with the calendar's success: the women soon have to deal with invasive journalists, embarrassed children, stressed-out husbands, and all the pressure that the attention puts on them. Finally, a bittersweet experience is in store for Annie and Chris when they're invited to go to America to publicize the calendar overseas. Totally unprepared for the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, their friendship is put to the test as the strain over their personal lives takes its toll.But in a film this light and frothy, you know that there's a happy ending on the horizon. Shot throughout the picturesque North Yorkshire, the film is beautiful to look at, and Mirren and Walters are wonderful as the longtime friends whose bond is both strengthened and tested by their mutual desire to raise money to fight the disease that took their friend and husband away. There's some predictability (who didn't see that Ruth's husband would be a cheater?) and a couple of loose ends left dangling (there's not much closure given on the humiliation that Chris's son has to deal with at school) but these are just nitpicks.For those who are interested, the real Calendar Girls began their fundraising in 1999, and the main characters Chris and Annie are based on Tricia Stewart and Angela Baker, who in turn were inspired by the death of Angela's husband John Richard Baker, to whom the film is dedicated to. The photographer was Terry Logan, the husband of one of the women volunteering for the project (this was obviously changed for the film), but the initial attempt by the women to shield themselves from his gaze by having him call out instructions from the next room actually happened, followed by them realizing that they were being ridiculous and bringing him inside. The women were indeed invited to appear on the Jay Leno show, with the talk-show host making a cameo appearance in the film, and to date, the women have raised over 2 million for Leukemia Research, the UK's leading blood cancer charity.All this is recounted on the DVD featurette that includes interviews with all the women involved, sharing their experiences from their initial idea to their time spent on the red carpet in Hollywood. It's just as funny and inspiring as the movie itself. It's a rare thing to have such film center on the friendship of two women (it might just be me, but I'm so tired of all these ""bromances"" that seem to be everywhere these days), especially two women who aren't swimsuit models, spies in cat-suits, or bland love interests.Instead, this is a truly heartwarming film about women in a small community doing a very great thing.",5,"""The Last Phase is

John, however, is in the terminal stages of leukemia, and kept it a secret from Annie until very close to death. Annie and her closest childhood friend, Chris (Prime Suspect douenne Helen Mirren), hit on an idea to raise money to buy a new couch to replace the horrible one at the hospital: they'll recruit some of the other Women's Institute crowd and do the world's first nude calendar featuring, shall we say, women who have gotten on in years.It is hysterically funny, tear-inducing, and moves exceptionally quickly; when the shooting happens twenty minutes into a hundred-minute film, the viewer is left wondering how on earth they're going to fill another eighty minutes. And here is perhaps the film's biggest and most wonderful present to the viewer; the last eighty minutes of this film fly by at light speed. Getting to the photography (and Helen Mirren unclothed, which has been a welcome sight in cinema for the past quarter century) was the hard part. Once you get past it and into the lives of these women, the movie becomes utterly absorbing.Much of this has to do with the amazing raft of talent assembled for this film. When Graham Crowden (of Waiting for God fame) is relegated to a minor role and gets less than two minutes of screen time (albeit with one of the movie's dead funniest lines), you know you've got a major cast. They happen to include Celia Imrie (Gormenghast), Annette Crosbie (Underworld, Wyrd Sisters), Linda Bassett (The Hours), Ciaran Hinds (Prime Suspect), Geraldine James (White Teeth), and I could go on for a thousand words just like this.Don't expect anything terribly deep, of course.

Luckily, ""Calendar Girls"" boasts an enormously witty screenplay and first-rate performances by its highly gifted cast.  Each of the ""girls"" is given her own unique personality so that we see them not just as a group, united in this inspiring endeavor, but as individuals working through their own personal demons on the rode to the project's completion.  The women face the expected roadblocks and snafus in the form of ""shocked,"" disapproving voices in the community, but their belief in the rightness of their cause brushes all such problems aside.This charming film provides more genuine, out-and-out laughs than almost any comedy of recent times.

Tired of having the same boring speakers (who delve into the fascinating world of rag rugs, or the different species of broccoli), member Annie (Julie Walters, ""Billy Elliot"") asks her husband John, an avid horticulturist, to speak at the institute. John, however, is battling luekemia, and before he can do his speech, he passes away. Annie and longtime pal Chris (Helen Mirren of ""Gosford Park"") decided to raise money to replace the hideously uncomfortable sofa in the relatives room of the hospital wing John was treated at. But another WI calendar featuring jams, flowers, or the countryside? That barely raised 75 pounds the previous year!Something in John's WI speech motivates Chris; ""The flowers of Yorkshire are like the women of Yorkshire"", he wrote. ""In each phase of their lives, they become more radiant"". This impowers Chris and Annie to recruit 10 more WI members to strip down to the buff and pose for a professional photographer. The pictures turn out great, but the girls face trouble when their local WI branch president wants to put a stop to what she feels is a scandalous idea. Chris and Annie have to fight the head WI counsel, and each other, as their popularity grows. They go from Yorkshire, to the Jay Leno show in L.A. (where they lounge by their hotel pool with Anthrax!), and back again. But the huge success of the calendar begins to distract Chris from her family responsibilities, and threatens to put up a hedge between her and Annie.  Helen Mirren gives a wonderful performance, and is well deserving of the Golden Globe she has been nominated for. A film not to be missed.

Schaub ""TSchlaack""","[2, 2]","The women of North Yorkshire, England do as many English country women do and join the Woman's Institute (WI) for friendship and to learn new things.  Unfortunately the WI that is in Rylstone has gotten a bit dull.  They seem to only be learning about things such as how many uses there is for broccoli and how to pick the perfect tea towel.  But, this is all due to change.  Annie's husband who is the local arborist suddenly develops leukemia.  Unfortunately the love of friends, family and lots of medicine does not cure him and he passes on.  When sitting with Annie in the ""Relatives Room"" one afternoon Chris comments that if people spend too much time on the couch in the room then they will need to build a wing of the hospital to treat them.  During one of the WI meetings the chair starts to talk about the yearly calendar that is put together as a fund raiser, this year's tropic is sure to inspire lots of shots, as it is Church Steeples of Rylstone.  Later while at a local auto body shop Chris spots the Pirelli Tire calendar and suddenly has a brain storm.  Chris convinces a number of the WI to pose nude, yes nude in their golden years for a fund raising calendar.  Her plan is to buy a new leather couch for the relative's room.  After much hemming and hawing the idea takes root and then the hunt for a photographer begins.Humor abounds as they look at portfolios of abstract artists, poodle photographers as well as butterfly aficionados.  But, no one is right for the photographer they need.  Finally they remember one of the orderlies for Annie's husband was a photographer.  They twist his arm into the project.  He comes back with the idea to have photos taken as if they were doing the painting, baking, knitting, gardening that the WI is known for, but with one slight difference, they would do it in the nude.  After much wine, a lot of peer cheering and encouragement they make the calendar.The calendar takes hold and becomes a hit.  Once it is a hit in Britain it also becomes a huge success ""across the pond"" in the States.I loved this movie.  I thought I would be a little turned off at seeing the women posing nude.  But as the show states ""it isn't naked it's nude"".  If you like the Full Monty you will love this one.  One thing that is to be noted is that this is based on a true story.  To date they have done 2 calendars as well as planning for a 2007 version and have raised more than 1 million pounds (2 million dollars) for the leukemia foundation, and yes they got the leather couch.  This movie was very tastefully done with the normal British flair for using normal looking people and likeable characters that are not perfect.",5,I loved this British Comedy/Real life story!,1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,2670,"['women', 'North', 'Yorkshire', 'England', 'do', 'many', 'English', 'country', 'women', 'do', 'join', 'Woman', 'Institute', 'WI', 'friendship', 'learn', 'new', 'things', 'Unfortunately', 'WI', 'Rylstone', 'gotten', 'bit', 'dull', 'seem', 'only', 'be', 'learning', 'things', 'such', 'how', 'many', 'uses', 'broccoli', 'how', 'pick', 'perfect', 'tea', 'towel', 'due', 'change', 'Annie', 'husband', 'who', 'local', 'arborist', 'suddenly', 'leukemia', 'Unfortunately', 'love', 'friends', 'family', 'lots', 'medicine', 'not', 'cure', 'When', 'sitting', 'Annie', 'Relatives', 'Room', 'one', 'afternoon', 'Chris', 'comments', 'people', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'couch', 'room', 'then', 'will', 'need', 'build', 'wing', 'hospital', 'treat', 'one', 'WI', 'meetings', 'chair', 'talk', 'yearly', 'calendar', 'put', 'together', 'fund', 'raiser', 'year', 'tropic', 'sure', 'inspire', 'lots', 'shots', 'Church', 'Steeples', 'Rylstone', 'Later', 'local', 'auto', 'body', 'shop', 'Chris', 'Pirelli', 'Tire', 'calendar', 'suddenly', 'brain', 'storm', 'Chris', 'number', 'WI', 'pose', 'nude', 'yes', 'nude', 'golden', 'years', 'fund', 'raising', 'calendar', 'plan', 'buy', 'new', 'leather', 'couch', 'relative', 'room', 'much', 'hemming', 'hawing', 'idea', 'root', 'then', 'hunt', 'photographer', 'begins.Humor', 'look', 'portfolios', 'abstract', 'artists', 'poodle', 'photographers', 'as', 'well', 'butterfly', 'aficionados', 'one', 'right', 'photographer', 'need', 'Finally', 'remember', 'one', 'orderlies', 'Annie', 'husband', 'was', 'photographer', 'twist', 'arm', 'project', 'back', 'idea', 'have', 'photos', 'taken', 'were', 'doing', 'painting', 'baking', 'knitting', 'gardening', 'WI', 'known', 'one', 'slight', 'difference', 'would', 'do', 'nude', 'much', 'wine', 'lot', 'peer', 'cheering', 'encouragement', 'make', 'calendar.The', 'calendar', 'hold', 'hit', 'hit', 'Britain', 'also', 'huge', 'success', 'pond', 'States.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'turned', 'off', 'seeing', 'women', 'posing', 'nude', 'show', ""n't"", 'naked', 'nude', 'like', 'Full', 'Monty', 'will', 'love', 'one', 'One', 'thing', 'be', 'noted', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'date', 'have', 'done', '2', 'calendars', 'as', 'well', 'planning', '2007', 'version', 'have', 'raised', 'more', '1', 'million', 'pounds', '2', 'million', 'dollars', 'leukemia', 'foundation', 'yes', 'got', 'leather', 'couch', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'tastefully', 'done', 'normal', 'British', 'flair', 'using', 'normal', 'looking', 'people', 'likeable', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'perfect']",N/A

806343,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001I55M4,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","The incredible story of &quot;Calender Girls&quot; is based on the truth.  In 1999, the fifty-something women in small Yorkshire town decided on making an annual calender for the local Women's Institute ... this time, in nude.  In spite of the husbands (who just didn't believe they mean it), the plan turned out a great success, selling more than 300,000 copies that year.  In &quot;Calander Girls&quot; able all-British cast bring the life and charm into this story, making it a very funny comedy drama.The story's center is Helen Mirren's Chris, who is fed up with the &quot;respectable&quot; activities of WI.  When her best friend Annie's husband dies, however, Chris thinks of a radical idea of rasing money for the sofa to donate to the hospital -- nude calender featuring themselves.  She and Annie (Julie Walters, best known as Ron's mom in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;), at first fearfully, then confidently carries on the plan, and around them come nine other ladies to make the unique selection of &quot;Calender Girls.&quot;The story may look as if a rip-off of &quot;Full Monty,&quot; but the strength of &quot;Calender Girls&quot; is that it happened in reality.  Both films, interestingly, have something to do with liberating themselves from the hundrum life, like the five naked guys in &quot;Monty,&quot; the ladies here gradually start to shine.  You might say, perhaps naturally: &quot;How come doing nudity can be related to being free in spirit?&quot;  Sure, but after watching the delightful sequences of &quot;Calender Girls,&quot; you will believe it can.And the charms of the film come mainly from the cast and very funny (I mean, in the British way) dialogues.  The surprise casting of Helen Mirren (NOT Julie Walters) as talkative and rather flamboyant Chris pays off tremendously, as you will see in the many wonderful scenes -- see, for example, how Chris consoles Annie in hospital -- and from these scenes, you soon know the film is going to be a success.  And it is.The film is slightly guilty of over-dramatizing the real-life events, which must have been less eventful as they are  described now.  The episodes in Hollywood are weak, without which the film could stand on its own.But the fact remains -- it is quite refreshing to see these ladies (who belong to Women's Institute) changing the conventional images of UK, and in that &quot;Calender Girls&quot; is full of impact, and fun, which is best represented by the line: &quot;I am 55 years old, if I'm not gonna get them out now, when am I?&quot;  Charming, isn't it?",4,"&quot;You're Nude in the Telegraph, dear.&quot; Purely Delightful",1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,2556,"['incredible', 'story', 'quot', 'Calender', 'Girls', 'quot', 'based', 'truth', '1999', 'fifty-something', 'women', 'small', 'Yorkshire', 'town', 'decided', 'making', 'annual', 'calender', 'local', 'Women', 'Institute', 'time', 'nude', 'spite', 'husbands', 'who', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'mean', 'plan', 'turned', 'out', 'great', 'success', 'selling', 'more', '300,000', 'copies', 'year', 'quot', 'Calander', 'Girls', 'quot', 'able', 'all-British', 'cast', 'bring', 'life', 'charm', 'story', 'making', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', 'drama.The', 'story', 'center', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Chris', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'quot', 'respectable', 'quot', 'activities', 'WI', 'When', 'best', 'friend', 'Annie', 'husband', 'dies', 'however', 'Chris', 'radical', 'idea', 'rasing', 'money', 'sofa', 'donate', 'hospital', 'nude', 'calender', 'featuring', 'Annie', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'best', 'known', 'Ron', 'mom', 'quot', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'quot', 'first', 'fearfully', 'then', 'confidently', 'plan', 'come', 'nine', 'other', 'ladies', 'make', 'unique', 'selection', 'quot', 'Calender', 'Girls.', 'quot', 'story', 'may', 'look', 'rip-off', 'quot', 'Full', 'Monty', 'quot', 'strength', 'quot', 'Calender', 'Girls', 'quot', 'happened', 'reality', 'films', 'interestingly', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'liberating', 'hundrum', 'life', 'five', 'naked', 'guys', 'quot', 'Monty', 'quot', 'ladies', 'here', 'gradually', 'start', 'shine', 'might', 'say', 'perhaps', 'naturally', 'quot', 'How', 'come', 'doing', 'nudity', 'can', 'be', 'related', 'being', 'free', 'spirit', 'quot', 'Sure', 'watching', 'delightful', 'sequences', 'quot', 'Calender', 'Girls', 'quot', 'will', 'believe', 'charms', 'film', 'come', 'mainly', 'cast', 'very', 'funny', 'mean', 'British', 'way', 'surprise', 'casting', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'NOT', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'talkative', 'rather', 'flamboyant', 'Chris', 'tremendously', 'will', 'see', 'many', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'see', 'example', 'how', 'Chris', 'Annie', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'soon', 'know', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'success', 'is.The', 'film', 'slightly', 'guilty', 'over-dramatizing', 'real-life', 'events', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'eventful', 'are', 'described', 'now', 'episodes', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'weak', 'film', 'could', 'stand', 'own.But', 'fact', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'see', 'ladies', 'who', 'belong', 'Women', 'Institute', 'changing', 'conventional', 'images', 'UK', 'quot', 'Calender', 'Girls', 'quot', 'full', 'impact', 'fun', 'best', 'represented', 'line', 'quot', 'am', '55', 'years', 'old', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'get', 'out', 'now', 'when', 'am', 'quot', 'Charming', ""n't""]",N/A

It is more of a woman's anthem--a strong affirmation of self by middle-aged women who refuse to be buttonholed as &quot;grannies.&quot;Based on a real-life story, the plot surrounds a group of Yorkshire, UK women's club members whose annual charity calendar takes on a new meaning when one of their own loses her husband to leukemia. Instead of the same-old dreary photos of churches and flowers, a maverick group within the club decides to pose nude in the hopes that the calendar will earn enough money to buy new furniture for the family waiting room at the local hospital.None of these very proper women has stripped before; in fact, many refuse to view their own bodies, let alone show them to others. But despite their real fears and modesty, they do it anyway--with very surprising results.It's a sweet story with a wonderful ending: The real-life calendar girls, as of the making of this movie, have earned over $500,000 for leukemia research! Which brings me to the extras: I found the interviews with the actual women who posed to be absolutely fascinating.
