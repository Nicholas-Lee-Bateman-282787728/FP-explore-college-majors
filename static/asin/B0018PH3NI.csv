1160728,A1ZLFCUF4XX7RZ,B0018PH3NI,Alex,"[0, 0]","Morgan Spurlock takes an interesting, and sometimes, funny look, into the search for Osama bin Laden, the Middle East's outlook on the global war on terrorism and America's government's role in that war.He starts out on this quest because his wife, is due to have a baby, and he wants to make this world as safe for the baby as possible. And that means finding Osama. So after he does some preparation, from shots, to working out, to defense training, he goes over to the Middle East and begins to interview people.He doesn't just interview those on the street, many of whom have a low opinion of the US government, but not necessarily of the American people; but also those related to, and may have known, or did know, suspected, and no so suspected, terrorists. He also doesn't just let the good go by. There are some who cannot stand the US government or the American people. But overall many in the Middle East are saying what many people do already know. Osama and his ilk have hijacked Islam and used it for evil. The same as Fred Phelps and his ilk have hijacked Christianty and spout evil. (Granted they don't blow up people or buildings, but they're really just as bad.)He also explores the Israeli and Palestinian conflict. I learned that many Palestinians do not appreciate bin Laden and wish he'd stop using them to further his cause. He also goes to Afghanistan and Pakistan and you see that many of the people there are frustrated with the lack of progress we're not making, but have no wish to return to the Taliban.Overall this is a good documentary with a fun twist. I found the video game sequences very funny. I didn't find it to be a statement on the rightness or wrongness of the war on terror, but a look at it from ""their"" side.I did like that he talked to many parents, himself going to become one. Many parents only wish what American parents wish. A good, safe environment for their children, education and the ability to grow up happy. Falling into bin Laden's camp is like a child going a high profile gand in the US.

1160730,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0018PH3NI,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","Not quite up to Morgan Spurlock's superlative documentarySuper Size Me, WHERE IN THE WORLD IS OSAMA BIN LADEN is still topical and interesting. Where Super Size Me had a distinct focus, this newest documentary loses that. Let me explain...Initially set up as a means to make the world a safer place for Morgan, his mate, and their future child, Morgan sets out to find bin Laden so that he can help the world become a safer place. Knowing that the U.S. has spent billions of dollars and countless soldier hours looking for this elusive, tall, dialysized jihadist, Morgan figures maybe all it'll take is one determined future father.Scouring the globe as if he wereCarmen Sandiego(Everyone gets that analogy, right? No? Look it up), Spurlock becomes a fearless explorer in and around the Middle East, searching for this dangerous killer. But what starts out as a journey of righteousness turns more into a discovery of the differences that divide the Muslim world from itself, from western religious doctrine, and from the policies of the U.S.. This is where things went a bit haywire for the film. Although most viewers will probably be forgiving of this since journeys like this often lead down other paths, it still felt awkward as Spurlock jumped around between political dignitaries, religious fanatics (on both sides), and U.S. ground-based troops in Afghanistan and how they felt about the war effort.It is commendable that Spurlock used animation (like the aforementioned Carmen Sandiego) to get his point across. The silliness of the animation was meant to show how crazy his quest might seem to us but, in the end, it comes across as something he simply had to do ...if not for his future kid, then for himself and the rest of us who live his experience vicariously.The ending is a pretty big letdown and it didn't line-up very well with the beginning of the film. Seeing the alternate ending on the dvd, I really feel it would've been a much better true ending to the documentary.Still, this is a very topical issue that shows not just one man's quest for answers, but a challenge to the U.S. that shows how close one man can come to finding Osama. Perhaps the U.S. military really doesn't want to find this madman. What reason would we have then for staying over there? Oil?

I was expecting something more tongue-in-cheek and sarcastic even, something that was used to embarrass or expose, but that was not the case.  Instead, Morgan Spurlock gives us a balanced and eye-opening portrayal of Muslims and Jews in his effort to find Osama Bin Laden.  Spurlock begins with getting training for the mission and his attempts to learn survival and fighting techniques are humorous.  He then proceeds to travel to different parts of the world to explore locales and interview individuals whom he thinks may lead him to his prey.  He confronts the expected dead ends and denials but , in his travels he also uncovers for the viewer the face of humanity in its different manifestations - poor, hardworking Muslims in Afghanistan who live barely above subsistence levels, Jewish and Muslim intellectuals and activists who are trying to do good, street vendors and shop owners from both sides of the divide trying to live their lives in a decent manner, adhering to their traditions, including that of showing hospitality to strangers.  At the same time, the rifts between the West and Islam and between Muslims, Arabs and Jews are not whitewashed.  They are palpably there but they are presented in the context of human striving for understanding and even transcendence.  There was only truly off-putting character in the film that got physically aggressive with Spurlock and had to be restrained by local police.  What was particularly ironic and telling was when Spurlock went to Afghanistan; most of the people told him that Bin Laden was in Pakistan as in ""Where else would he be?""  And that is indeed where he was.

1160733,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B0018PH3NI,D. Hartley,"[9, 13]","An admirably earnest, if flawed attempt by the likeable documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock (""Super Size Me"") to reach out to the ""everyday folks"" living in the Middle East and show Americans that they're really just like us, after all; you know- ""people are people"", and all that. Oh, and while he was there, he thought he might get some leads on where Osama's bin hidin'.Spurlock's concept for his new film was inspired by his wife's pregnancy (their first child). While brainstorming proactive steps he could take to ensure a ""safe world"" for his unborn, he thought he might start by doing his part to end the war on terror-by helping our hapless government locate You Know Who. Using the gimmicky framing device of an ersatz videogame to introduce film segments, we follow Spurlock's progress as he travels to Egypt, Israel, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Morocco in search of the vox populi (and the slippery tall dude with the walkie-talkie).With the exception of a few extra-cranky customers, like a genuinely scary radical Muslim cleric with a vitriolic demeanor and a Charlie Manson glare to match, most of Spurlock's subjects seem to be expressing a variation on ""You know, I really don't have any truck with the American people, but I do hate your government with the intensity of a thousand suns."" Proving of course, that they really ARE like us (well, those of us who are hip to the present administration's ongoing 7-year mission to completely obliterate what's left of America's goodwill around the globe). And, predictably, the response to queries on bin-Laden's whereabouts is usually a shrug and a laugh, or a vague point in the direction of the border they share with a neighboring country.There are a couple genuinely funny moments that temper the underlying grimness of the volatile politics in the region. For instance, a high ranking official in Tora Bora (location of the infamous subterranean HQ for bin Laden in Afghanistan) speaks enthusiastically of his proposed plan to turn the caves into a tourist attraction. Spurlock is to be admired for keeping a straight face throughout this particular interview.Unfortunately however, it becomes apparent that Spurlock's mission (such as it is) doesn't really have any real driving theme; what you're left with is an unfocused travelogue featuring a series of amusing but somewhat repetitive ""fish out of water"" vignettes (frankly, he could pick up a few lessons on how to more convincingly pull off the ironic faux-journalist shtick by studying Sascha Baron Cohen or the maestros of ""The Daily Show"") The film is a closer cousin to ""The Road to Morocco"" than it is to ""The Road to Guantanamo"".

Although the film has its flaws, it makes some extremely good points about human nature and how people who seem to be so different from us are actually much more similar to us than we may have thought. The cinematography works very well throughout the film. These cameramen did an excellent job; they shot over 800 hours of footage in order to make this film! (Now that's an editing job!) Morgan doesn't really need to act much in this movie; he's on a quasi-serious mission to find Osama Bin Laden. I think he knew from the start that he was making a film about people we may fear when we don't need to fear them; I doubt that he was actually expecting Bin Laden to come jumping out of a cave somewhere and say, ""OK, Morgan, here I am! I surrender!""We first see Morgan preparing for his trip. He gets more injections than I could count; and he takes some training exercises to be able to protect himself against grenade bombs, would-be assassins and more. He also has to leave his pregnant wife behind him but he promises her that he'll be back in time for their baby to be born.Once Morgan gets where he's going, he asks people questions. In fact, he asks a lot of questions. We get fascinating interviews with people on the street and there are more interviews with some other people who were kind enough to let Morgan Spurlock into their homes. Morgan frequently, if not always, asks them their opinion of America, Israel, Osama Bin Laden and more. We often see people saying that they have nothing against the American people; but wow, how they hate the American government. He does encounter some trouble from a few people who don't want to be interviewed; but I don't think he was too surprised by this.Along the way Morgan Spurlock uses humor in an apparent attempt to make the subject matter a bit easier for people to swallow. In my opinion, this didn't always work. For example, Spurlock asks an Afghani man about a Tora Bora amusement park plan, Spurlock suggests that they call it ""the bomb."" Hey, the country's been at war for 30 years--that's not necessarily going to be perceived as a funny joke, Morgan! The guy being interviewed didn't laugh; and even though some of us might laugh I wouldn't have taken that chance with someone in a tough foreign country where trouble is easy to find, especially when they had been nice enough to sit down with me for an interview. In addition, Spurlock mocks both his own efforts as well as the international efforts to find Bin Laden for real; he approaches the entrance to a cave and yells ""Osama., are you in there?"" Yeah, it IS funny; but it's also nave and silly, not to mention potentially dangerous--who knows who might really have been in that cave at the time? Morgan also skips over Iran and Iraq; he apparently knew enough to set some limits on his quest to find Bin Laden.Overall, the film is about a B+. Morgan Spurlock's true message in this film is that we should fear other cultures less and recognize them as being much more like us than they are different from us. He could have done a better job of proving this when he went to one or two of the countries he visited; but he gets his point across nonetheless. I recommend this film for people studying this situation and sociologists will have a field day watching this film.",4,very good but not quite what he's capable of producing,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,3410,"['Where', 'World', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'film', 'highly', 'creative', 'rather', 'brave', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'film', 'flaws', 'extremely', 'good', 'points', 'human', 'nature', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'so', 'different', 'are', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'similar', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'cinematography', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'cameramen', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'shot', '800', 'hours', 'footage', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'Now', 'editing', 'job', 'Morgan', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'act', 'much', 'movie', 'quasi-serious', 'mission', 'find', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'think', 'knew', 'start', 'was', 'making', 'film', 'people', 'may', 'fear', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'fear', 'doubt', 'was', 'actually', 'expecting', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'come', 'jumping', 'cave', 'somewhere', 'say', 'OK', 'Morgan', 'here', 'am', 'surrender', 'first', 'see', 'Morgan', 'preparing', 'trip', 'more', 'injections', 'could', 'count', 'training', 'exercises', 'be', 'able', 'protect', 'grenade', 'bombs', 'would-be', 'assassins', 'more', 'also', 'leave', 'pregnant', 'wife', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'time', 'baby', 'be', 'born.Once', 'Morgan', 'where', 'going', 'people', 'questions', 'fact', 'lot', 'questions', 'get', 'fascinating', 'interviews', 'people', 'street', 'are', 'more', 'interviews', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'kind', 'enough', 'let', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'homes', 'Morgan', 'frequently', 'not', 'always', 'opinion', 'America', 'Israel', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'more', 'often', 'see', 'people', 'saying', 'have', 'nothing', 'American', 'people', 'wow', 'how', 'hate', 'American', 'government', 'encounter', 'trouble', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'interviewed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'too', 'surprised', 'way', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'humor', 'apparent', 'attempt', 'make', 'subject', 'matter', 'bit', 'easier', 'people', 'swallow', 'opinion', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'example', 'Spurlock', 'Afghani', 'man', 'Tora', 'Bora', 'amusement', 'park', 'plan', 'Spurlock', 'call', 'bomb', 'Hey', 'country', 'been', 'war', '30', 'years', 'not', 'necessarily', 'going', 'be', 'perceived', 'funny', 'joke', 'Morgan', 'guy', 'being', 'interviewed', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'even', 'might', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'chance', 'someone', 'tough', 'foreign', 'country', 'where', 'trouble', 'easy', 'find', 'especially', 'when', 'had', 'been', 'nice', 'enough', 'sit', 'down', 'interview', 'addition', 'Spurlock', 'own', 'efforts', 'as', 'well', 'international', 'efforts', 'find', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'real', 'entrance', 'cave', 'Osama.', 'are', 'Yeah', 'funny', 'also', 'nave', 'silly', 'not', 'mention', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'who', 'who', 'might', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'cave', 'time', 'Morgan', 'also', 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'apparently', 'knew', 'enough', 'set', 'limits', 'quest', 'find', 'Bin', 'Laden.Overall', 'film', 'B+', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'true', 'message', 'film', 'should', 'fear', 'other', 'cultures', 'less', 'recognize', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'different', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'proving', 'when', 'went', 'one', 'two', 'countries', 'visited', 'point', 'nonetheless', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'studying', 'situation', 'sociologists', 'will', 'have', 'field', 'day', 'watching', 'film']",N/A

First of all, when this movie was being made someone let it slip/heavily implied that they had found ""The Holy Grail"" with this movie. Without trying to spoil it for you, they didn't even find a holy goat. Secondly, someone apparently told Spurlock that he was funny, and while he does make an amusing quip every once in a while, the whole thing feels forced, and even somewhat inappropriate considering the goal of his trip. Bin Laden is responsible for the greatest act of terrorism and murder in this country, and Spurlock turns his film into a video game. A real documentary on where Bin Laden is would be very interesting, but Spurlock seems more interested in making himself a star, and he's not that interesting, nor should he take center stage in a film on this topic.The more I really think about the ego behind this film the more offended I get, even though when watching it you don't immediately feel such offense because of how vapid it is.

It's hard to believe that some viewers couldn't see that fact presented here. After seeing it, I thought everyone needs to see it in order to create a better world,e.g., love and acceptance, and a safe and peaceful place to raise a family. That shouldn't be that difficult except for the few who just can't seem to connect with their heart causing strife for practically everyone else.

1160741,A337FAEETGA4HE,B0018PH3NI,Publius,"[1, 3]","My initial reaction to the film was wishing that there was more of it.  I'm constantly fascinated with how well interviews with people in the street yield a better, more complete view of current events and attitudes than many a history or political analysis.  Still, I wish there had been more in the way of discussion with each of the interviewees.  Of course, then the movie would have been four hours long.The problem of length is what I think keeps this film from greatness.  It is impossible to make a completely cogent movie about the interplay between the West and the Islamic world in 90 minutes, so in a way it's understandable that so many critics of Spurlock's have bashed him as shallow or inappropriately glib.  However, I'm also convinced that Spurlock's critics are also far too harsh in their assessments of what is really a personal look at Muslims rather than a documentary on the political realities of Islam.  This isn't a political treatise, and it is strange to treat it as such.Perhaps Spurlock is a bit sappy, and the film is very sentimental, yet I think you must be a terrible cynic to find much fault in that.  I find it odd and frankly annoying that so many people regard messages of peace, understanding, and brotherhood as vapid or shallow, while at the same time glorifying every dull, lifeless, politico/militaristic view of world events as edifying and factual.  It's the same reason why comedies are rarely if ever nominated for best film at the Oscars.  Cheap cynicism is everywhere.  But, are people really at a point where finding something positive to say about the world and other cultures is so abhorrent?The movie's main purpose was to show that the Muslim world is not as bad as the media makes it out to be and encourages people in the US to reach out and at least talk to Muslims.  I think that is an entirely appropriate and admirable goal.  I also think that Spurlock largely succeeds with this film.  Let the Bah Humbug crowd wallow in their misery.

That's what Morgan Spurlock, the documentarian who brought us ""Super Size Me,"" is determined to find out - and he's gone and made a whole movie on the subject.  He wonders why, all these years after 9/11, the man who perpetrated that atrocity has yet to be found and brought to justice - even with a $25 million reward hanging over his head.  So if the CIA and the FBI can't locate him, perhaps Spurlock himself can.  And with a baby of his own on the way, Spurlock has a new-found reason for wanting the world to be a peaceful place.  So off he goes on a tongue-in-cheek - but, at the same time, deadly serious - tour through some of the most dangerous places on Earth in search of the Most Wanted Man in the universe.So, after getting his inoculations, a little defense and survival training, some language lessons and tips on fashion, Spurlock is off and running on his journey.He makes stops in Egypt, Morocco, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and, finally, Pakistan (where most experts believe bin Laden is hiding out, if,  indeed, he's alive at all) and, in each of those places, he discovers that people are just people, regardless of their religious and sectarian differences, and that the vast majority of them want pretty much the same thing: to earn a decent living, to provide for their families, and to see their children grow up in a world where people are free to live at peace with one another.Not that he doesn't encounter individuals who express support for bin Laden and al Queda and sympathize with their causes - just that such people appear to be in the minority, even in that part of the world.Spurlock is unsparing in his criticism of America for propping up dictators in these areas and for funding their brutal regimes, thereby providing a fertile breeding ground for present and future terrorists.  But he also takes swipes at the radical Muslims themselves, who, through their extremist, blood-soaked actions, do all they can to give Islam a bad name.  Perhaps, the most fascinating leg of the tour occurs in Saudi Arabia, where even Spurlock is shocked by what he sees:  a country where church and state are truly one, where there is no freedom of speech or the press, and where religious moderates are as rare as a bin Laden sighting in a local strip joint. This leads to the most bizarrely incongruous and darkly amusing image in the film:  that of an opulent, state-of-the-art mall swarming with women shoppers covered from head to toe in black burkas.While Spurlock is dead serious in his intentions, his tone in ""Where in the World is Osama bin Laden?"" is refreshingly light-hearted and gleefully ironic.  He even finds humor in exploring the caves of Tora Bora, where, it is believed, bin Laden planned out the 9/11 attacks and where he was last seen.  Spurlock also uses animation and simulated video game imagery to enliven the tone.It doesn't require a spoiler alert to report that Spurlock is ultimately unsuccessful in finding bin Laden - if that indeed was his actual goal.  But if his intention was a broader one - namely, providing an amazingly comprehensive survey of attitudes in the Muslim world and to show that we are all in this fight together - he has achieved it ten times over.",4,serious documentary with humorous touches,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,3340,"['Forget', 'Carmen', 'Sandiego', 'What', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'where', 'world', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'what', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'documentarian', 'who', 'brought', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'gone', 'made', 'whole', 'movie', 'subject', 'why', 'years', '9/11', 'man', 'who', 'perpetrated', 'atrocity', 'yet', 'be', 'found', 'brought', 'justice', 'even', '25', 'million', 'reward', 'hanging', 'head', 'So', 'CIA', 'FBI', 'ca', ""n't"", 'locate', 'perhaps', 'Spurlock', 'can', 'baby', 'own', 'way', 'Spurlock', 'new-found', 'reason', 'wanting', 'world', 'be', 'peaceful', 'place', 'So', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'same', 'time', 'deadly', 'serious', 'tour', 'most', 'dangerous', 'places', 'Earth', 'search', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'Man', 'universe.So', 'getting', 'inoculations', 'little', 'defense', 'survival', 'training', 'language', 'lessons', 'tips', 'fashion', 'Spurlock', 'off', 'running', 'journey.He', 'stops', 'Egypt', 'Morocco', 'Israel', 'Jordan', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Afghanistan', 'finally', 'Pakistan', 'where', 'most', 'experts', 'believe', 'bin', 'Laden', 'hiding', 'out', 'indeed', 'alive', 'places', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'people', 'regardless', 'religious', 'sectarian', 'differences', 'vast', 'majority', 'want', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'earn', 'decent', 'living', 'provide', 'families', 'see', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'free', 'live', 'peace', 'one', 'another.Not', ""n't"", 'encounter', 'individuals', 'who', 'express', 'support', 'bin', 'Laden', 'al', 'Queda', 'sympathize', 'causes', 'just', 'such', 'people', 'appear', 'be', 'minority', 'even', 'part', 'world.Spurlock', 'unsparing', 'criticism', 'America', 'propping', 'up', 'dictators', 'areas', 'funding', 'brutal', 'regimes', 'thereby', 'providing', 'fertile', 'breeding', 'ground', 'present', 'future', 'terrorists', 'also', 'swipes', 'radical', 'Muslims', 'who', 'extremist', 'blood-soaked', 'actions', 'do', 'can', 'give', 'Islam', 'bad', 'name', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'fascinating', 'leg', 'tour', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'where', 'even', 'Spurlock', 'shocked', 'what', 'country', 'where', 'church', 'state', 'are', 'truly', 'one', 'where', 'freedom', 'speech', 'press', 'where', 'religious', 'moderates', 'are', 'as', 'rare', 'bin', 'Laden', 'sighting', 'local', 'strip', 'joint', 'most', 'bizarrely', 'incongruous', 'darkly', 'amusing', 'image', 'film', 'opulent', 'state-of-the-art', 'mall', 'swarming', 'women', 'shoppers', 'covered', 'head', 'toe', 'black', 'burkas.While', 'Spurlock', 'dead', 'serious', 'intentions', 'tone', 'Where', 'World', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'refreshingly', 'light-hearted', 'gleefully', 'ironic', 'even', 'humor', 'exploring', 'caves', 'Tora', 'Bora', 'where', 'believed', 'bin', 'Laden', 'planned', '9/11', 'attacks', 'where', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'Spurlock', 'also', 'animation', 'simulated', 'video', 'game', 'imagery', 'enliven', 'tone.It', ""n't"", 'require', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'report', 'Spurlock', 'ultimately', 'unsuccessful', 'finding', 'bin', 'Laden', 'indeed', 'was', 'actual', 'goal', 'intention', 'was', 'broader', 'one', 'namely', 'providing', 'amazingly', 'comprehensive', 'survey', 'attitudes', 'Muslim', 'world', 'show', 'are', 'fight', 'together', 'achieved', 'ten', 'times']",N/A
