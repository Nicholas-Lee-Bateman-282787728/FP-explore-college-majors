639052,A3GQRM5HHD0CSM,B00005JO2G,"Brittney Reed ""garnet17""","[18, 18]","A beautiful pastor's daughter (Keri Russell), devastated over her mother's death, engages in a brief romance with a dashing soldier during WWII as a source of consolation. Soon after he leaves for Europe, she realizes that she is pregnant. Mattie's (I THINK that was the girl's name) father is furious over his daughter's indiscretion and arranges for her to quietly marry a young man in the parish of one of his minister friends...far from home. Mattie has no other choice but to marry the good hearted, but rather distant young farmer. Will Mattie grow to love her husband of convenience or will the father of her child return for her? Hopefully, this wonderful movie will be released on dvd and you will get the chance to find out.This movie is very clean and family friendly. When the movie begins, Mattie is already pregnant, so you won't see her hitting the sack...this is a hallmark movie after all! I found the movie to be very sweet with several genuinely funny parts. Overall, this is a good movie about forgiveness and true love. A must see.",5,Excellent Hallmark Hall of Fame Movie,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,1052,"['beautiful', 'pastor', 'daughter', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'devastated', 'mother', 'death', 'brief', 'romance', 'dashing', 'soldier', 'WWII', 'source', 'consolation', 'Soon', 'Europe', 'pregnant', 'Mattie', 'THINK', 'was', 'girl', 'name', 'father', 'furious', 'daughter', 'indiscretion', 'arranges', 'quietly', 'marry', 'young', 'man', 'parish', 'one', 'minister', 'friends', 'far', 'home', 'Mattie', 'other', 'choice', 'marry', 'good', 'hearted', 'rather', 'distant', 'young', 'farmer', 'Will', 'Mattie', 'grow', 'love', 'husband', 'convenience', 'will', 'father', 'child', 'return', 'Hopefully', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'dvd', 'will', 'get', 'chance', 'find', 'out.This', 'movie', 'very', 'clean', 'family', 'friendly', 'When', 'movie', 'Mattie', 'already', 'pregnant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'hitting', 'sack', 'hallmark', 'movie', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'sweet', 'several', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'parts', 'Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'forgiveness', 'true', 'love', 'must', 'see']",The Magic of Ordinary Days

It is a good period movie, clothing, cars, businesses, even the tractor fit the time frame.It is about consequences, good and bad.You will love the steady pace of falling really in love.After making a wrong choice,came the miracle of finding a loving,caring,nonjudgmental man,whose sole purpose is to serve another human being when help was really needed. One who helps you to recognize that you will one day forgive yourself. Then allows you to.It captures the awfulness of war,when innocent people get caught up in war related circumstances, in this case a wrong decision on the US government's part, to place all Japanese Americans in POW camps. The disruption in their lives,and the struggles that they faced.Also farm life is a major part of the movie, the way people look at the same land, for instance, from different perspectives.The support of family and community, was really what does happen in some lucky places.All actors,actresses were perfect for their parts, you will fall in love with them, as you go along!It really is artful in all aspects, beautifully presented.",5,Pulls you in right off.,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,1116,"['Keeps', 'engaged', 'whole', 'time', 'good', 'period', 'movie', 'clothing', 'cars', 'businesses', 'even', 'tractor', 'fit', 'time', 'frame.It', 'consequences', 'good', 'bad.You', 'will', 'love', 'steady', 'pace', 'falling', 'really', 'love.After', 'making', 'wrong', 'choice', 'came', 'miracle', 'finding', 'loving', 'caring', 'nonjudgmental', 'man', 'sole', 'purpose', 'serve', 'human', 'being', 'when', 'help', 'was', 'really', 'needed', 'One', 'who', 'recognize', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'forgive', 'Then', 'to.It', 'awfulness', 'war', 'when', 'innocent', 'people', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'war', 'related', 'circumstances', 'case', 'wrong', 'decision', 'US', 'government', 'part', 'place', 'Japanese', 'Americans', 'POW', 'camps', 'disruption', 'lives', 'struggles', 'faced.Also', 'farm', 'life', 'major', 'part', 'movie', 'way', 'people', 'look', 'same', 'land', 'instance', 'different', 'perspectives.The', 'support', 'family', 'community', 'was', 'really', 'what', 'happen', 'lucky', 'places.All', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'perfect', 'parts', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'go', 'along', 'really', 'artful', 'aspects', 'beautifully', 'presented']",The Magic of Ordinary Days

Skeet Ulrich did a wonderful job playing the lonely farmer who would do anything to make Livy (Keri Russell) happy. This is a story of redemption and forgiveness and unconditional love. I don't know how many times I have watched it, probably over 50. I had to buy another copy of the DVD because my friends kept borrowing it. I also read the book. I would like to see a sequel of this movie - like the Sarah Plain and Tall series from Hallmark. If you have the same thought there is a petition online asking Hallmark to do just that.
