Now after 10 years flying for an airline, I can testify that the story in the movie and many others are true. In this profession you hear and see things that will make you head spin. I guess it's the effect of pressurization that affect people in a weird way.The movie although low budget was very nice and easy to watch and understand. It is 1990s technology so don't expect much but the sound and picture are pretty good for that era. I think people in aviation will appreciate this movie more than somebody outside of the industry but it is still a good watch.",5,Great movie and true story.,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,643,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'back', '90s', 'got', 'aviation', 'Now', '10', 'years', 'flying', 'airline', 'can', 'testify', 'story', 'movie', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'true', 'profession', 'hear', 'see', 'things', 'will', 'make', 'head', 'spin', 'guess', 'effect', 'pressurization', 'affect', 'people', 'weird', 'way.The', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'easy', 'watch', 'understand', '1990s', 'technology', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'era', 'think', 'people', 'aviation', 'will', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'more', 'somebody', 'industry', 'still', 'good', 'watch']",Frequent Flyer

He stars as an airline pilot heart throb who propels his way through the sky catering to women at multiple destinations.

In some instances the acting could have been better.  You can always spot the HIRED IN DALLAS talent from the professional actors but it doesn't matter because you are so caught up in the story right from the start.  And, what fun when ""the worm turns"" so to speak and the fur starts to fly.  You will love seeing Shelley Hack as the original and only real wife when she finally ""gets a clue"" and follows it no matter how much it hurts to know the truth.  I'm buying a copy to lend a friend as I'm afraid she might lose my copy. I live in the area where this story happened and where it was filmed so was fun to spot familiar places.
