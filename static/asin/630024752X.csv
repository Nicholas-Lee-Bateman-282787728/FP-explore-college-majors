He has an affair with the leading lady.  The kids have to go leave and live with fathers that don't want them.  One by one, the kids make their way back to his home.  He tucks them in and tells them,&quot;As long as I gotta home...you gotta home.&quot;  His play is a success and these cool kids help him celebrate. These child actors really ARE cool, too.

226762,AQUU8S55JGY2H,630024752X,Aco,"[4, 5]","This is a sweet, heart-strong film, and features a terrific performance from Al Pacino. Made a couple years after Kramer Vs. Kramer, it is similar in placing a loving father in the predicament of fighting for their children when his wife decides to leave them. Though this isn't about divorce, rather about the charm, pleasure and pressure of parenthood and a professional life.Pacino and the kids are the best part, while the two women, his wife Gloria-mother to four of the five kids, sired by three different men, prior to Pacino's Ivan, and Alice Detroit-famous actress starring in his new Broadway play, have flimsier, partial characters to work with. Particularly Gloria, played by Tuesday Weld, is a heartless and troubled woman, but the film expresses her need to abandon men and children as her just ""being who she is."" This statement is made after Ivan tracks her down to bring her home to her kids, who could use a mother, during a good scene where it is brought home just who she is and what she is capable of. Still, it certifies her as a villain of less-than-justified-motivation. Alice Detroit, played by Dyan Cannon, is sweet and nice, swiftly starting an affair with Ivan, then just as swiftly moving in with him and the kids, but her part is ancillary too. The kids, particularly Igor, Ivan's only natural child, and Geraldo, the one kid who stays with him when the others return to their blood fathers, are terrific. The films scene with Ivan and the two boys is at it's best. Ivan is an orphan and his desire to raise and care for the kids is beautiful, an aspect of Pacino's character that hasn't been seen in a while.Written by playwright Israel Horovitz, this is a good theatre-themed film too. As a writer struggling domestically and professionally it is fun and believable.The music seemed oddly similar to ""Tootsie"" too. Anyway...It seems like Pacino doesn't do this kind of work anymore. Like DeNiro in Stanley & Iris and Falling in Love, Gene Hackman in Twice in a Lifetime, Dustin Hoffman in Kramer Vs. Kramer, etc. The middle class/working class domestic drama/comedy. He is truly excellent in the part, which is low-key, true and sweet.",3,Another Pacino part to be taken away by...,1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,2167,"['sweet', 'heart-strong', 'film', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Made', 'couple', 'years', 'Kramer', 'Vs.', 'Kramer', 'similar', 'placing', 'loving', 'father', 'predicament', 'fighting', 'children', 'when', 'wife', 'leave', ""n't"", 'about', 'divorce', 'rather', 'charm', 'pleasure', 'pressure', 'parenthood', 'professional', 'life.Pacino', 'kids', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'two', 'women', 'wife', 'Gloria-mother', 'four', 'five', 'kids', 'sired', 'three', 'different', 'men', 'prior', 'Pacino', 'Ivan', 'Alice', 'Detroit-famous', 'actress', 'starring', 'new', 'Broadway', 'play', 'have', 'flimsier', 'partial', 'characters', 'work', 'Particularly', 'Gloria', 'played', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'heartless', 'troubled', 'woman', 'film', 'need', 'abandon', 'men', 'children', 'just', 'being', 'who', 'statement', 'made', 'Ivan', 'down', 'bring', 'home', 'kids', 'who', 'could', 'use', 'mother', 'good', 'scene', 'where', 'brought', 'home', 'just', 'who', 'what', 'capable', 'Still', 'villain', 'less-than-justified-motivation', 'Alice', 'Detroit', 'played', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'sweet', 'nice', 'swiftly', 'starting', 'affair', 'Ivan', 'then', 'just', 'swiftly', 'moving', 'kids', 'part', 'ancillary', 'too', 'kids', 'particularly', 'Igor', 'Ivan', 'only', 'natural', 'child', 'Geraldo', 'one', 'kid', 'who', 'when', 'others', 'return', 'blood', 'fathers', 'are', 'terrific', 'films', 'scene', 'Ivan', 'two', 'boys', 'best', 'Ivan', 'orphan', 'desire', 'raise', 'care', 'kids', 'beautiful', 'aspect', 'Pacino', 'character', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'while.Written', 'playwright', 'Israel', 'Horovitz', 'good', 'theatre-themed', 'film', 'too', 'writer', 'struggling', 'domestically', 'professionally', 'fun', 'believable.The', 'music', 'seemed', 'oddly', 'similar', 'Tootsie', 'too', 'Anyway', 'Pacino', ""n't"", 'do', 'kind', 'work', 'anymore', 'DeNiro', 'Stanley', 'Iris', 'Falling', 'Love', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Twice', 'Lifetime', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Kramer', 'Vs.', 'Kramer', 'etc', 'middle', 'class/working', 'class', 'domestic', 'drama/comedy', 'truly', 'excellent', 'part', 'low-key', 'true', 'sweet']",Author Author VHS

226766,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,630024752X,Cubist,"[17, 17]","Author! Author! is a guilty pleasure. It features Pacino in one of his rare forays into comedy (the other being the underrated and little-seen '70s gem, Scarecrow) as a beleaguered New York City playwright who has to juggle a houseload of kids, a wife who is cheating on him and a play that he is struggling to get off the ground.This is a sweet, endearing film that isn't too sappy as to give you diabetes. Pacino really keeps everything grounded and delivers a wonderfully understated performance. He lets all the kids ham it up and deliver the best lines, especially, as one reviewer pointed out, the youngest one who is a really good little actor. What happened to that kid? And you've got veteran thesps like Tuesday Weld, Dyan Cannon, and my personal fave, Alan King, who doesn't do enough films, IMO.This is one of those comfort movies that you end up turning on partway through on TV and then watch all the way to the end. There is just something about it that is so fascinating to watch. Maybe because it was so reviled by critics and ignored by audiences that it now languishes in Cable TV limbo awaiting a possible DVD release... some day?This film is also a great snapshot of NYC circa the late '70s early '80s. The film uses its locations so well and anyone who has lived there (or still lives there) will instantly recognize certain places and areas.

The former plays AlPacino's wife, the latter his mistress. Both are actresses ofdistinction. Both look terrific. Both should be reminded that this tooshall pass.As Broadway playwright Ivan Travalian, an Armenian Neil Simon, AlPacino is another matter. Pacino is an actor of distinction, but hedoes not look terrific - he looks, in fact, unaccountably dissipated,like mid- period Leonard Cohen - and he has retained the leadenlifelessness he brought to Cruising. Because Israel Horovitz'sabominable script was apparently conceived with Richard Dreyfuss inmind (Ivan Travalian is a twinkly, manic shouter), Pacino'slugubriousness sabotages whatever infinitesimal chance the movie mighthave had for success (it's not what you'd call a great loss).The much-married Ivan is rearing, $ la Dustin Hoffman's Ted Kramer,five children abandoned by Ivan's various wives. He is a loving fatherand is so devotedly altrustic he is lacking an artist's ego - thereason this mother hen wants the newest play to become a hit is sothere will be enough money to feed the chicks.The brood is composed of the most appalling set of exhibitionisticchild actors this side of Eight Is Enough; the delicately modulatedcharacterizations achieved from the young performers in E.T. andPoltergeist by Steven Spielberg appear to be the products of anotherspecies.That this comedy is not funny is bad enough; that it is resolutely andmaliciously anti-female is unforgivable. Miss Weld's witless wife isso self-absorbed the audience actually applauds when Pacino tells herto stay out of the ocean and ""give the sharks a break,"" while MissCannon's Broadway actress is so selfish she can't stand more than aweek with the playwright's kiddies. (I know why: as a performer ofsensitivity, she is tortured by the bad acting in the house.) Kramervs. Kramer's mild sentimentality about single fathers has become afull-blown disease in Author! Author!: Israel Horovitz hasn't written acharacter; he's put Mother Teresa into a townhouse.
