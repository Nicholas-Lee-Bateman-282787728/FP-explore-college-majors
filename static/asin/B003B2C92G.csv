This distributor comes out of Canada and there were missing scenes & dialogue, which were, in my opinion, not a good thing.I may be that this is the only Blu-ray version that exists for the film. Perhaps Mcfarlane couldn't strike a deal with New Line--who know's.

1335176,A3AIVGSZ4CTVQY,B003B2C92G,ward81,"[0, 0]","From 1995 to 1998 comics had a great time. We were blessed with wonderful comic books like xmen, spiderman, gen 13, and Spawn. For me, Spawn was at the top of my list cause, it was dark, twisted and deeply imaginative. Then came the spawn movie and this changed the world forever. We no longer wanted to see our heroes on paper: we wanted to see them on screen.  I think this caused comics to sure die out, and the guys that were reading the comics, wanted to put these characters on the big screen. Spawn was great, but there was something left out of the translation for me, probably because it wasn't r rated. It had to be pg13 to reach a broader audience, but it still worked. But we were not ready for that yet. Blade is the only comic movie that took that r rated risk and it worked. But now that spawn has been introduced to the world cinematicly and animated, mcfarlane should try again in rated r. I would love a retelling or a sequel. Just make sure its a gritty as the comic book.",4,One of the best at the time,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,991,"['1995', '1998', 'comics', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'were', 'blessed', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'books', 'xmen', 'spiderman', 'gen', '13', 'Spawn', 'Spawn', 'was', 'top', 'list', 'cause', 'was', 'dark', 'twisted', 'deeply', 'imaginative', 'Then', 'came', 'spawn', 'movie', 'changed', 'world', 'forever', 'no', 'longer', 'wanted', 'see', 'heroes', 'paper', 'wanted', 'see', 'screen', 'think', 'caused', 'comics', 'sure', 'die', 'out', 'guys', 'were', 'reading', 'comics', 'wanted', 'put', 'characters', 'big', 'screen', 'Spawn', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'something', 'left', 'translation', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'r', 'rated', 'had', 'be', 'pg13', 'reach', 'broader', 'audience', 'still', 'worked', 'were', 'not', 'ready', 'yet', 'Blade', 'only', 'comic', 'movie', 'took', 'r', 'rated', 'risk', 'worked', 'now', 'spawn', 'been', 'introduced', 'world', 'cinematicly', 'animated', 'mcfarlane', 'should', 'try', 'again', 'rated', 'r.', 'would', 'love', 'retelling', 'sequel', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'gritty', 'comic', 'book']",N/A
