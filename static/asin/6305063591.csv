There are only a couple of good barefoot shots. The story line (yes there actually is one!) holds together pretty well, and the nudity is not the cheesy gratuitous kind; it all fits well into the story line. It would have got another star in the rating if they'd left a little less to the viewer's imagination, but hey... it was made in a more censor-strict era, after all.",3,Good example of the genre,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,515,"['review', 'R', 'rated', 'version', 'VHS', 'films', 'well', 'not', 'having', ""'unrated"", 'fairly', 'generous', 'skin', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'good', 'barefoot', 'shots', 'story', 'line', 'yes', 'actually', 'one', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', 'nudity', 'not', 'cheesy', 'gratuitous', 'kind', 'well', 'story', 'line', 'would', 'have', 'got', 'star', 'rating', ""'d"", 'left', 'little', 'less', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'hey', 'was', 'made', 'more', 'censor-strict', 'era']",N/A

This is really a lesbian love story tenderly told. First of all, in order to get the most enjoyment from this movie you need to buy UNRATED. I followed the advice of other reviewers and bought this through the U.K web site, even though the movie was sent to me through an American company. Weird how it works that way. But I didn't want to risk getting a butchered version, so I bought U.K. I was charged 15 pounds (or is that Euros?), which translates into 28 American dollars. It is worth every cent I paid. I absolutely ADORE this movie. Jack (Bentley Mitchum) is a photographer involved in a steamy relationship with Jill (Landon Hall), but he seems to treat her ""like a piece of meat"". The other Jill (Dana Plato) is an art director who arrives from New York to work with Jack on a fashion catalog featuring beautiful models. Jack starts pressuring his girlfriend into going along with a menage a trois with the other Jill. But she keeps telling him ""no"". What he doesn't realize is that his girlfriend is fantasizing about Jill as much as Jill is fantasizing about her. While at a restaurant the two Jills perform a tango dance that is really adorable. Dana, it would seem, had quite a talent for dancing the lead in the tango. Their dance is one of the gems in this movie. But Jack is turned on by their dancing, and once again, pressures his girlfriend into going along with his plan. She gets upset and storms out of the restaurant. Jill follows her all the way home. What evolves between the two of them is very tender and affectionate. There is nothing dirty going on between them. It is love and tenderness that you see. Dana, apparently, was very comfortable playing the woman experienced in lesbian affairs. It shows on screen. But I was also impressed with Landon Hall. She plays her role effectively. When Jack finds out his girlfriend is ""going AC/DC on him"" he is predictably upset and not a little jealous. This story is told realistically. There are even some comedic scenes in this movie. It is tender, realistic, and at times, humorous. And yet...when you see Dana in this movie you can't help but feel a tremendous amount of compassion and sadness for her. One scene in particular makes me cry every time I see it. If you saw the E True Hollywood Story about her that aired in 1999 you know she was shocked when they decided to rate this movie ""X"". She really did not deserve the way some people treated her. And towards the end of the movie you notice the scars on her left wrist. So sad that her life had to end the way it did.",5,"""A tender lesbian love story beautifully told""",1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,2624,"['Do', 'not', 'discount', 'movie', 'write', 'off', 'actually', 'seeing', 'really', 'lesbian', 'love', 'story', 'tenderly', 'told', 'First', 'order', 'get', 'most', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'need', 'buy', 'UNRATED', 'followed', 'advice', 'other', 'reviewers', 'bought', 'U.K', 'web', 'site', 'even', 'movie', 'was', 'sent', 'American', 'company', 'Weird', 'how', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'risk', 'getting', 'butchered', 'version', 'bought', 'U.K', 'was', 'charged', '15', 'pounds', 'Euros', '28', 'American', 'dollars', 'worth', 'cent', 'paid', 'absolutely', 'ADORE', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Bentley', 'Mitchum', 'photographer', 'involved', 'steamy', 'relationship', 'Jill', 'Landon', 'Hall', 'treat', 'piece', 'meat', 'other', 'Jill', 'Dana', 'Plato', 'art', 'director', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'work', 'Jack', 'fashion', 'catalog', 'featuring', 'beautiful', 'models', 'Jack', 'pressuring', 'girlfriend', 'going', 'along', 'menage', 'trois', 'other', 'Jill', 'telling', 'What', ""n't"", 'realize', 'girlfriend', 'fantasizing', 'about', 'Jill', 'as', 'much', 'Jill', 'fantasizing', 'restaurant', 'two', 'Jills', 'perform', 'tango', 'dance', 'really', 'adorable', 'Dana', 'would', 'seem', 'had', 'quite', 'talent', 'dancing', 'lead', 'tango', 'dance', 'one', 'gems', 'movie', 'Jack', 'turned', 'dancing', 'once', 'again', 'girlfriend', 'going', 'plan', 'upset', 'restaurant', 'Jill', 'way', 'home', 'What', 'two', 'very', 'tender', 'affectionate', 'nothing', 'dirty', 'going', 'love', 'tenderness', 'see', 'Dana', 'apparently', 'was', 'very', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'woman', 'experienced', 'lesbian', 'affairs', 'screen', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'Landon', 'Hall', 'role', 'effectively', 'When', 'Jack', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'going', 'AC/DC', 'predictably', 'upset', 'not', 'little', 'jealous', 'story', 'told', 'realistically', 'are', 'even', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'movie', 'tender', 'realistic', 'times', 'humorous', 'yet', 'when', 'see', 'Dana', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'compassion', 'sadness', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'cry', 'time', 'see', 'saw', 'E', 'True', 'Hollywood', 'Story', 'aired', '1999', 'know', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'decided', 'rate', 'movie', 'X', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'way', 'people', 'treated', 'end', 'movie', 'notice', 'scars', 'left', 'wrist', 'So', 'sad', 'life', 'had', 'end', 'way', 'did']",N/A
