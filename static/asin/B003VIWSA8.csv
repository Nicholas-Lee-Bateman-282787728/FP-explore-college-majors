1367225,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003VIWSA8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[92, 93]","Tom Selleck is Jesse Stone!  I don't know who author Robert B. Parker might have envisioned inhabiting his iconic small town police chief, but Selleck has certainly owned and perfected the role over the course of these 6 made-for-TV movies.  Stone must surely be one of the most laid back heroes to ever grace the small screen and Selleck has perfected the minimalism necessary to make this character stand out.  In the film world of quick cut editing, these films defy expectation by unfolding at a very leisurely pace.  For the most part, the mysteries place a distant second in importance to the characterizations and the humor developed in the scripts (for which Parker does share a writer's credit).  For the Stone series to be successful, you've got to care about the principals.  So while Selleck is as comfortable as an old slipper in his role--it is also important to single out the recurring cast that helps to sell these tidy mysteries.  With stellar talents like Viola Davis, William Devane and Kathy Baker providing back-up (not to mention a quietly impressive Kohl Sudduth), it's easy to become invested in this small community of characters no matter what challenge they're faced to solved.Starting with 2005's ""Stone Cold"" through this year's (2010) ""No Remorse,"" each of the six films obviously has its own central plot and mystery.  While the earlier films are probably regarded as stronger entries plot-wise (I found the convenience store diversion in the last film almost painful), I do think each chapter has enough to recommend it on its own merits.  You'll appreciate the films to varying degrees as with any serialization--some you may love, some just like.  However, to my way of thinking, what has made this series terrific is the continuing back story and its respect to the characters.  Jesse Stone and team have evolved through the years and their interactions, relationships and growth in the totality of these six films is what is so very special.In truth, there is nothing ground-breaking here.  Just old pros putting on some great entertainment.  Lacking hysterics and over-the-top action set pieces, the Jesse Stone series is a quietly compelling throw-back to when stories and people mattered more than special effects.  And, as always, the icing on the cake is the pitch perfect Tom Selleck who paints Jesse as both lovable and excruciatingly frustrating.  It may be his best role ever, so it's no surprise he's come back 6 times!

Somehow I felt serene amongthe quiet hardships and overall morose atmosphere thatpervades each subsequent scene, something that directorRobert Harmon truly has a knack for capturing.I found that there was a mild relation to Stone's lonelinessand embittered past, and an unwavering solicitousnessfor his semi-controlled drunkenness, as glass by glassby glass by glass had gone by. An engrossing story andcharacter-driven series that left me anticipating thenext release.On my way home from the liquor store one dreary, rainynight, thirsting from my recently acquired taste for Scotch,I swerved into the video store to pick up the latest Stonedrama. And let me tell ya, a letdown it is not. It's chockfull of the quips, awkward interactions and quirkycharacters that we Stone fans have come to love.Though the books stopped with Parker's passing, Selleck andteam haven't. In the latter sequels the directors have alsochanged, but my trusty glass hasn't. And sure enough, Stonereluctantly seeks help from his witty psychiatrist time andagain. It really is comforting to see him putting forth theeffort.So, I recently checked myself into AA where I attempted toovercome my unquenchable thirst for Scotch; that, and mynewly-formed habit of speaking to people in a roundaboutcaustic manner, which I can tell you really vexes thoseamong the group, especially the chain smoking team leader.Oh, and I've been threatened several times with restrainingorders.
