75492,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0784011524,Acute Observer,"[1, 4]","This western is another view of the Lincoln County War, the commercial rivalry between business owners over cattle, government contracts, etc. John Tunstall offers a home to young men. Dolan and Murphy are in cahoots with Sheriff Brady; they are against any competition. Will they eliminate it? [There is no mention of the economic depression of 1876 and its effects.] The story seems to be aimed for the audience of today, not for historical accuracy. But who can say undocumented events didn't happen?] The New Year is celebrated by firing guns into the air (a custom still observed). Soon fireworks will provide safer and saner noisemakers. The Murphy-Dolan gang shoots Tunstall to eliminate competition. So what will his cowboys do?Alex McSween, Tunstall's lawyer, gets the Justice of the Peace to deputize Tunstall's cowboys. William Bonney serves a warrant to Henry Hill, and others. They find and stop more of Murphy's men. Bonney is shown as blood-thirsty. `Buckshot' Roberts comes to collect a bounty on these deputies. Things go bad. Billy the Kid led his men to ambush Sheriff Brady, a cold-blooded murder. The Governor puts a $200 bounty on Billy, and revokes their status as deputies. Billy is wanted for murder by the law. A bounty hunter meets Billy and makes one mistake. Billy and his gang are chased by a larger band.The film shows the gang fleeing to Old Mexico. [Had Billy left the Territory of New Mexico his future would be different.] The film recreates the famous siege and burning of Alex McSween's store. It is dramatic entertainment, but I wonder how accurate it all is? The burning house leads to a desperate escape attempt. The film ends by telling about future events. [Robert M. Utley's book on Billy the Kid provides a more historical account.]",3,Lots of Sound and Fury,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,1776,"['western', 'view', 'Lincoln', 'County', 'War', 'commercial', 'rivalry', 'business', 'owners', 'cattle', 'government', 'contracts', 'etc', 'John', 'Tunstall', 'home', 'young', 'men', 'Dolan', 'Murphy', 'are', 'cahoots', 'Sheriff', 'Brady', 'are', 'competition', 'Will', 'eliminate', 'mention', 'economic', 'depression', '1876', 'effects', ']', 'story', 'be', 'aimed', 'audience', 'today', 'not', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'undocumented', 'events', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', ']', 'New', 'Year', 'celebrated', 'firing', 'guns', 'air', 'custom', 'still', 'observed', 'Soon', 'fireworks', 'will', 'provide', 'safer', 'saner', 'noisemakers', 'Murphy-Dolan', 'gang', 'shoots', 'Tunstall', 'eliminate', 'competition', 'what', 'will', 'cowboys', 'do', 'Alex', 'McSween', 'Tunstall', 'lawyer', 'Justice', 'Peace', 'deputize', 'Tunstall', 'cowboys', 'William', 'Bonney', 'warrant', 'Henry', 'Hill', 'others', 'find', 'stop', 'more', 'Murphy', 'men', 'Bonney', 'shown', 'blood-thirsty', 'Buckshot', 'Roberts', 'collect', 'bounty', 'deputies', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'led', 'men', 'ambush', 'Sheriff', 'Brady', 'cold-blooded', 'murder', 'Governor', '200', 'bounty', 'Billy', 'revokes', 'status', 'deputies', 'Billy', 'wanted', 'murder', 'law', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'meets', 'Billy', 'one', 'mistake', 'Billy', 'gang', 'are', 'chased', 'larger', 'band.The', 'film', 'gang', 'fleeing', 'Old', 'Mexico', '[', 'Had', 'Billy', 'left', 'Territory', 'New', 'Mexico', 'future', 'would', 'be', 'different', ']', 'film', 'famous', 'siege', 'burning', 'Alex', 'McSween', 'store', 'dramatic', 'entertainment', 'wonder', 'how', 'accurate', 'burning', 'house', 'desperate', 'escape', 'attempt', 'film', 'telling', 'future', 'events', '[', 'Robert', 'M.', 'Utley', 'book', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'more', 'historical', 'account', ']']",N/A

The film is just bland, with a cast of characters and actors who should have been at least entertaining and wound up being just as bland as everything else.  The story of Billy the Kid, much like the story of Jesse James, should be rich with character development and stirring social commentary.  If you aren't going to even try to be something intricate and detailed, at least have a smashing good time giving us thrills, chills and gunfights.  Sadly, `Young Guns' can't even get that right.  The interchange of characters is dreadfully morose and the action scenes are just mediocre at best.  The clich&eacute;d depictions of the characters are forgettable and at times even cringe inducing, and the repartee between the actors is surprisingly dull.

As both of these are Lionsgate propety, they share similar layout and content.  Young Guns, while a decent performer, doesn't seem to have the breathtaking image transfer I was hoping for.  If you already own the ""Special Edition"" standard DVD that was released no so long ago, you would be fine not to upgrade to this, particularly if you have a decent upscaler (albeit, for $19, this BRD is a bargain).  The picture seems slightly better defined than the standard version with the most notable improvements being in the blacks (which should be expected in hi-def).  Since I don't have a DTS-HD capable setup, I can't really review the audio on this disc other than to say that the standard DTS track sounds just like the one from the standard DVD - which isn't a negative.  The BRD also features the the same extra features from the DVD, which aint much.  The ""trivia"" track is kinda cool - much more graphically intensive than before and gives a decent insight into the making of the film as you're watching it.  As with First Blood, the pop-up menu is annoying in that is takes up half of the screen, but it's still functional and better than having to exit the film to play around.  If you already own the Special Edition DVD, this may not be the upgrade you ar hoping for... it is better than the standard DVD, just not by much.

In this case, the ex-deputy joins the rest in a revelry of mindless violence all of which is committed in the name of a good cause, although it is hard to see how the violence did anything constructive.Basically, this is just another empty action flick of mindless violence and mayhem with characters who have deluded themselves into thinking that they are the good guys.  Worst of all, the movie basically portrays these juvenile delinquents as being on the right side.  The idea that violence is an acceptable thing to engage in  if you believe that you are in the right is just simply not the kind of message that Hollywood should be conveying to young people.In summation, this is an awful movie.",1,Mindless Drivel of the Worst Kind,1086652800,"06 8, 2004",2004,1005,"['utterly', 'unhistorical', 'movie', 'real', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'was', 'basically', 'loner', 'who', 'shunned', 'gangs', 'such', 'quot', 'Regulators', 'quot', 'bunch', 'movie', 'One', 'characters', 'deputy', 'marshal', 'who', 'away', 'badge', 'usual', 'lines', 'how', 'law', 'really', 'side', 'evil', 'case', 'ex-deputy', 'rest', 'revelry', 'mindless', 'violence', 'committed', 'name', 'good', 'cause', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'violence', 'did', 'anything', 'constructive.Basically', 'just', 'empty', 'action', 'flick', 'mindless', 'violence', 'mayhem', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'deluded', 'thinking', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'Worst', 'movie', 'basically', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'being', 'right', 'side', 'idea', 'violence', 'acceptable', 'thing', 'engage', 'believe', 'are', 'right', 'just', 'simply', 'not', 'kind', 'message', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'be', 'conveying', 'young', 'people.In', 'summation', 'awful', 'movie']",N/A

Edwards,"[2, 3]","This review is for ""Young Guns (Special Edition)""  DVD(Widescreen; ""The Real Billy the Kid"" Documentary; Trivia Track--""Gunning for the 'Fact';"" and Audio Commentary with Lou Diamond Phillips, Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemoszko)I am unsure which was more entertaining: the movie ""Young Guns;"" the trivia track for the movie; or the so called documentary, ""The Real Billy the Kid.""  This is because the one thing that can be said about the historical Billy the Kid is that the ""facts"" are essentially unverifiable; which has lead to a division of sorts between ""historians"" writing about Billy the Kid.  In all of my own secondary research, I have concluded that Robert Utley's book, ""Billy the Kid: A Short and Violent Life,"" is the most valid interpretation.Given that ""Young Guns"" was intended to be a movie loaded with ""stars and future stars,"" more than anything else, the movie clearly demonstrates what great actors can do if they are willing to go the distance (""Young Guns"" was shot in only six weeks).  Moreover, I--and I am going out on a limb here, as I have not researched this--am of the mind that the movie was also intended to tell the story of the ""legend"" of Billy the Kid as a metaphor for current popular culture; including the ""non-traditional"" soundtrack.  (However, also see Sam Peckinpah's ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" for a ""non-traditional soundtrack and more violent interpretation of Billy the Kid).  Regardless, I cannot say enough about just how exciting and energetic ""Young Guns"" is to watch.  The ""young stars,"" even the small cameos, all add to the film.As for the ""documentary,"" I almost split a gut laughing.  I am not sure if the ""documentary"" was intended to present the ""truth"" about Billy the Kid, but that was not the case, except perhaps from some radical perspective, although some ""facts""--and again, all ""facts"" about Billy the Kid are subject to change--were informative.The trivia track was a hoot.  Again, I must believe that much of the ""trivia"" was done with tongue in cheek.  Whatever the reason, the ""trivia"" sure made the movie, ""Young Guns,"" all the more fun to watch.In the final analysis, it is my true belief that ""Young Guns"" should be--if not already--considered a classical western.Lastly, for those who want to ""quickly"" learn (instead of reading Robert Utley's book) about the questionable history of Billy the Kid, go to the Wikipedia site. Or one can watch ""Gore Vidal's Billy the Kid"" (1989--a year after ""Young Guns""), starring Val Kilmer as Billy and Duncan Regehr as Pat Garrett.  While this movie is currently available only in VHS format, it is also filmed like a more ""traditional western;"" but, in my opinion is the most ""historically accurate"" movie about Billy the Kid.Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.

Callaway,"[37, 43]","Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, and Kiefer Sutherland are just a few of the all-star cast who fill out this film about outlaws set in the old west: The story of Billy the Kid & Co.  Aside from the fact that its historical accuracy is more than highly questionable, the movie was more than entertaining.Emilio Estevez plays William H. Bonney, a.k.a. Billy the Kid who was a runaway and an alleged murderer, who was taken in by Mr. John Tunstall, an English cattleman.  Tunstall was murdered by a rival cattleman, a Mr. Murphy, played by Jack Palance.  The movie goes on from there with a killing spree of those who were responsible for the death of Tunstall.  The acting was great.  ""Dick,"" played by Charlie Sheen, was very good and one of Sheen's better roles.  Lou Diamond Phillips was absolutely amazing as the Mexican Indian: Jose Chavez y Chavez.  Charlie, played by Casey Siemasko, was a great and devoted friend, to Billy, and to the rest of the ""Regulators.""It is said that Billy the Kid was no where near as arrogant, nor as trigger happy as the film portrays, but Estevez was rather impressive in his skills both as an actor and a gunslinger.  Sutherland's ""Josiah `Doc' Scurlock"" was an admirable man; full of character and class given the circumstances.  Terrance Camp's role as ""John Tunstall"" was short-lived but excellent.This movie is highly entertaining.  I recommend it to anyone who likes a good Robin Hood story (who isn't terribly concerned of historical accuracy).

And that's just fine. It's a stupidly fun, turn-off-your-head flick if you're willing to approach it that way. Watch it as a serious western, though, and you're likely to be disappointed. This is an MTV western. No more, no less.Emilio Estevez puts a lot of energy into Billy the Kid, keeping the movie brisk. The rest of the cast are all solid, playing their clich&eacute;d characters as well as can be expected.Compared to today's rapid-fire action, ""Young Guns'"" blast em ups might seem lacking and tame, but it all works pretty well (for what it is). The style is all late-80s -- flashy, loud and rude. Big gun shots, rock and roll soundtrack, and car chases on horses. If that's your thing, ""Young Guns"" fits the bill. It's pure Bs to the wall action.But take note: If what you want is a strong western that lives beyond the genre as a standout film, western or not, you'd be better off seeking ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" or ""Unforgiven."" This ain't it.The DVD is of fine quality. The picture has never looked better, the audio is very impressive, and the packaging will look nice on your shelf. The extras are pretty good, too. A nice behind the scenes featurette, an excellent documentary on the real Billy The Kid, and a decent commentary make this a great bang-for-your-buck buy. You can't beat the price.As a DVD set for Young Guns fans, this is a five-star set (*****). As a film, this is a three-star film (***).

75529,A328S9RN3U5M68,0784011524,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","YOUNG GUNS is a nifty film to watch, not so much for the historical accuracy of the legend of Billy the Kid that it blatantly avoids, but for the obvious good time this cast of then young bucks had in working together. It may be difficult to realize that when this film was made (1988) these boys were in their twenties, some at the apex of their careers while others were still on the rise, and now they are hovering around 50.  Sort of a baby boomer film.  The story based on bits and pieces of the life of one of America's outlaw icons was written for the screen by John Fusco and was directed by Christopher Cain; it looks like an extended ad for Abercrombie and Fitch - and that's not necessarily a visual bad thing!The story is set in 1878 and a gentleman by the name of John Tunstall (an elegant performance by Terrance Stamp) is an English cattleman who has gathered 'regulators' to guard his property - those Regulators being the studs, Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), ""Jose; Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Richard 'Dick' Brewer (Charlie Sheen),  Charles 'Charley' Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko), and the tobacco chaw chewing Dirth Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney). A 'new guy' comes on the scene, the handsome, winsome  William H. 'Billy the Kid' Bonney (Emilio Estevez) and immediately attracts the attention of Tunstall who dresses him up and wins his affection.  A neighboring cattleman Lawrence G. Murphy (Jack Palance) and his men are arch enemies with Tunstall and in time murder Tunstall, a deed that sets into action the killing spree that is the core of the film. Billy the Kid gains fame and his gang of 5 find favor in the eyes of the prairie people - a Robin Hood take on the story. And of course there is the encounter with Patrick Floyd 'Pat' Garrett (Patrick Wayne, son of John Wayne).  It is a rootin tootin Western with some dialogue updating that somehow works coming form the mouths of the brat pack.  A great movie? No, but it is an entertaining one and an homage to a period of time when these young actors had style - back then.

75540,AKX28FGA6L47J,0784011524,Mark,"[6, 7]","In reading the other reviews of this film, it certainly seems as if nobody is really luke warm about Young Guns.It's either loved because it's relatively accurate or disliked because it's so fictional.Or the viewer enjoys it because Estevez and the other cast members are solid or it's disliked because it's the ""brat pack"" set in 1880's New Mexico.Well, let me throw out my 2 cents.Firstly, I've read alot of books about Billy The Kid and while the movie is not 100% accuarate, it's relatively close. I'm going alittle bit my memory here, but I don't recall a singlen incident in the movie that was a complete piece of fiction.Billy was taken in by John Tunstall - an English gentleman, who along with John Chisum, was ""butting heads"" with the Murphy -Dolan faction of Lincoln, New Mexico. And this small group who worked for Tunstall did eventually become deputized regulators who, unfortunately, killed Sheriff Brady and after that, became wanted men themselves.Now I read one review that said the The Kid was essentially a ""loner"" and that his involvement with a ""gang"" of Regulators couldn't have been more wrong.Well, this reviewer clearly doesn't know very much about Billy The Kid. The kid may have had many bad qualities (personally I don't think he did), but disloyalty was not one of them. In fact, his loyalty to John Tunstall and his decision to avenge the murder of his boss - and the one man who really gave Bonney a home - eventually cost him his lfe. There would have been many opportunities very early on in the Lincoln County War for The Kid to get out of the area, but he chose not to.Estevez's depiction of The Kid wasn't far off the mark.It's said that he always had a smile on his face and didn't carry a gudge for too long. But make no mistake - he was as cold-blooded a killer as any who resided in the west of the late 1800's.The fact is that with the exception of Bell, a deputy who was guarding him and who chose to resist The Kid when he retrieved a gun that was left for him in the privy, I don't think the Kid killed a single person who didn't deserve it or wasn't trying to kill the Kid himself.The Regulators were an interesting assortment of characters and I think the actors who portrayed them pulled it off reasonably well. Today, I would have a problem seeing Charlie Sheen as Dick Brewer - the leader of the Regulators - but when this film was made, he was fine.Jack Palance was his usual great self in his portrayal of Murphy, the ""bad"" guy who was responsible for Tunstall's murder. Terrence Stamp was fine as Tunstall - in fact, he was very convincing as a man who commanded such loyalty that a few very young men died to avenge his death. Keifer Sutherland was a very entertaing Doc Scurlock. In fact, I can't think of anybody who really didn't stand out in their performance.This movie is not Red River or The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance - it's never going to be mentioned when the great westerns of all time are discussed. But like Silverado, for example, it's very, very entertaining and provides a reasonably realistic depiction of one of the west's most enduring characterts - Billy The Kid.",4,Very Entertaining Film..,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,3139,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'certainly', 'nobody', 'really', 'luke', 'warm', 'Young', 'Guns.It', 'loved', 'relatively', 'accurate', 'disliked', 'so', 'fictional.Or', 'viewer', 'Estevez', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'solid', 'disliked', 'brat', 'pack', 'set', '1880', 'New', 'Mexico.Well', 'let', 'throw', '2', 'cents.Firstly', ""'ve"", 'read', 'alot', 'books', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'movie', 'not', '100', '%', 'accuarate', 'relatively', 'close', ""'m"", 'going', 'alittle', 'bit', 'memory', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'singlen', 'incident', 'movie', 'was', 'complete', 'piece', 'fiction.Billy', 'was', 'taken', 'John', 'Tunstall', 'English', 'gentleman', 'who', 'John', 'Chisum', 'was', 'butting', 'heads', 'Murphy', '-Dolan', 'faction', 'Lincoln', 'New', 'Mexico', 'small', 'group', 'who', 'worked', 'Tunstall', 'did', 'eventually', 'become', 'deputized', 'regulators', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'killed', 'Sheriff', 'Brady', 'became', 'wanted', 'men', 'themselves.Now', 'read', 'one', 'review', 'said', 'Kid', 'was', 'essentially', 'loner', 'involvement', 'gang', 'Regulators', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong.Well', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'know', 'very', 'much', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'kid', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'bad', 'qualities', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', 'disloyalty', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'fact', 'loyalty', 'John', 'Tunstall', 'decision', 'avenge', 'murder', 'boss', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'gave', 'Bonney', 'home', 'eventually', 'cost', 'lfe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'opportunities', 'very', 'early', 'Lincoln', 'County', 'War', 'Kid', 'get', 'area', 'chose', 'not', 'to.Estevez', 'depiction', 'Kid', 'was', ""n't"", 'far', 'mark.It', 'said', 'always', 'had', 'smile', 'face', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'gudge', 'too', 'long', 'make', 'mistake', 'was', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'who', 'resided', 'west', 'late', ""1800's.The"", 'fact', 'exception', 'Bell', 'deputy', 'who', 'was', 'guarding', 'who', 'chose', 'resist', 'Kid', 'when', 'retrieved', 'gun', 'was', 'left', 'privy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Kid', 'killed', 'single', 'person', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'kill', 'Kid', 'himself.The', 'Regulators', 'were', 'interesting', 'assortment', 'characters', 'think', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'pulled', 'off', 'reasonably', 'well', 'Today', 'would', 'have', 'problem', 'seeing', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Dick', 'Brewer', 'leader', 'Regulators', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'fine.Jack', 'Palance', 'was', 'usual', 'great', 'self', 'portrayal', 'Murphy', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'Tunstall', 'murder', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'was', 'fine', 'fact', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'man', 'who', 'commanded', 'such', 'loyalty', 'few', 'very', 'young', 'men', 'died', 'avenge', 'death', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'very', 'entertaing', 'Doc', 'Scurlock', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anybody', 'who', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'performance.This', 'movie', 'not', 'Red', 'River', 'Man', 'Who', 'Shot', 'Liberty', 'Valance', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'mentioned', 'when', 'great', 'westerns', 'time', 'are', 'discussed', 'Silverado', 'example', 'very', 'very', 'entertaining', 'reasonably', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'one', 'west', 'most', 'enduring', 'characterts', 'Billy', 'Kid']",N/A

This great western adventure has inspired over a decade of imitators on the big and small screen, but none of them nearly as successful or as fun as this one.Young Guns, of course, tells the story of William H. Bonney, the young New Mexico outlaw better known to history as Billy the Kid.  Billy is taken in by the kind-hearted English merchant John Tunstall, who is invloved in a trade dispute with local  Irish mob boss John Murphey, a powerful member of a circle of corrupt New Mexico politicians known as the Santa Fe Ring.  After Murphey's Boys assasinate Tunstall, The Kid and his Regulators are deputized to bring in the perpatrators.  But instead of issuing the warrants as ordered, Billy goes on the war path, knocking off Tunstall's killers, becoming outlaws in the process, and escalating the war, intending to ultimately bring down Murphey and the Ring. What ensues is action adventure history as Billy and his Regulators ride across the New Mexico desert with guns blazing.Despite it's Hollywood overtones, this a great western adventure that unlike many earlier Billy the Kid films, shows time went into researching the actual history of the events that shaped Billy's short but famous life.  Emilio Estevez, as Billy, plays a darkly likable outlaw leader alongside his brother Charlie Sheen as Dick Brewer, the foreman of the Regulators.  A fantastic supporting cast including Keiffer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Jack Palance, Terrence Stamp, and many others bring this classic 80s western to life .  Young Guns inspired in me an intense interest in the history of the West as well as a love of great western movies like this one.

75545,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,0784011524,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[5, 6]","Modern made western, re-telling the historical and dramatic events that unfolded in Lincoln County, New Mexico.  The film attempts to cover the beginning of the Lincoln County wars and the rise and early fame of Billy the Kid.  The movie portrays William H. Bonney (E. Estevez) as a trigger-happy, zealous renegade who shoots first and asks questions later.  Dick Brewer (C. Sheen) and Doc Scurlock (K. Sutherland) are Billy's fellow Regulators and early members of his gang.  Supportive characters in the movie are John Tunstall (T. Stamp), Billy's early mentor; and L.G. Murphy (J. Palance), the evil cattle baron of Lincoln County.  The movie depicts how Billy came under the care of Tunstall, then turned into a Regulator, and then into the most infamous outlaw in the American West.Billy, although half a lunatic and a killer with no shame, is shown as the protaganist.  Even though the director shows Billy's dark side, time and again, it's not as if his victims are displayed as sweet, loving angels.  The antagonist in the film is L.G. Murphy and his Santa Fe Ring of corruption over New Mexico.  The movie attempts to suggest that it's Murphy and his ring of murderers that created the monster known in history as Billy the Kid.  There is an obvious attempt to excuse Billy's wrongs by showing Murphy and his men as more sinister, which is successful in making Billy's character very likeable and Murphy's despicable.There's quite a bit of unrealism in the movie.  Such as a man--with well over a hundred guns aimed at him--leaping out of a trunk, guns blazing, and surviving despite two shots in the chest.  Or another man--same scene actually--getting shot to death with several bullets hitting his body, only to find enough strength to raise his pistol and kill his attacker with one round.There's also historical inaccuracy.  John Tunstall is portrayed as an older Englishman, when in fact he was in his mid-twenties when he took Billy in.  Murphy is portrayed as the Ring leader of Lincoln County, when in fact it was another cattle baron named Dolan who formed an alliance with Murphy to bring Tunstall down.  Certain members of Billy's gang get killed off, when in fact they live a little bit longer and die in different circumstances and areas.  L.G. Murphy did not get shot in real life, he dies shortly after the Lincoln County wars of some illness.  There is some accuracy in the film, however.  The gunfight at the out-house was very accurate as was the shoot out with Sheriff Brady's men in the middle of the streets of Lincoln.""Young Guns"" is rated ""R"" for gun violence, language, and brief nudity.  There is a scene where a man shoots a gun in the face of another man--the blast exiting out the back of his head--easily makes this film rated ""R.""  Only one mention of the ""F-word"", but it is used during fast speech and difficult to hear.  The nudity is that of a man's buttocks as he stands up suddenly in the bathtub.To sum up, ""Young Guns"" is a fascinating and exciting western that's full of entertainment.  It blends humor and drama well and its action is not difficult to follow.  It is without a doubt the best Billy the Kid movie made thus far.  It's main criticism lies in making a historical killer the protagonist--a bold but common move that Hollywood is known to spur.",5,"""I like these odds.""",1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,3305,"['Modern', 'made', 'western', 're-telling', 'historical', 'dramatic', 'events', 'unfolded', 'Lincoln', 'County', 'New', 'Mexico', 'film', 'attempts', 'cover', 'beginning', 'Lincoln', 'County', 'wars', 'rise', 'early', 'fame', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'movie', 'William', 'H.', 'Bonney', 'E.', 'Estevez', 'trigger-happy', 'zealous', 'renegade', 'who', 'shoots', 'first', 'questions', 'later', 'Dick', 'Brewer', 'C.', 'Sheen', 'Doc', 'Scurlock', 'K.', 'Sutherland', 'are', 'Billy', 'fellow', 'Regulators', 'early', 'members', 'gang', 'Supportive', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'John', 'Tunstall', 'T.', 'Stamp', 'Billy', 'early', 'mentor', 'L.G', 'Murphy', 'J.', 'Palance', 'evil', 'cattle', 'baron', 'Lincoln', 'County', 'movie', 'how', 'Billy', 'came', 'care', 'Tunstall', 'then', 'turned', 'Regulator', 'then', 'most', 'infamous', 'outlaw', 'American', 'West.Billy', 'lunatic', 'killer', 'shame', 'shown', 'protaganist', 'Even', 'director', 'Billy', 'dark', 'side', 'time', 'again', 'not', 'victims', 'are', 'displayed', 'sweet', 'loving', 'angels', 'antagonist', 'film', 'L.G', 'Murphy', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'Ring', 'corruption', 'New', 'Mexico', 'movie', 'suggest', 'Murphy', 'ring', 'murderers', 'created', 'monster', 'known', 'history', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'excuse', 'Billy', 'wrongs', 'showing', 'Murphy', 'men', 'more', 'sinister', 'successful', 'making', 'Billy', 'character', 'very', 'likeable', 'Murphy', 'despicable.There', 'quite', 'bit', 'unrealism', 'movie', 'Such', 'man', 'well', 'hundred', 'guns', 'aimed', 'leaping', 'trunk', 'guns', 'blazing', 'surviving', 'two', 'shots', 'chest', 'man', 'same', 'scene', 'actually', 'getting', 'shot', 'death', 'several', 'bullets', 'hitting', 'body', 'only', 'find', 'enough', 'strength', 'raise', 'pistol', 'kill', 'attacker', 'one', 'round.There', 'also', 'historical', 'inaccuracy', 'John', 'Tunstall', 'portrayed', 'older', 'Englishman', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'mid-twenties', 'when', 'took', 'Billy', 'Murphy', 'portrayed', 'Ring', 'leader', 'Lincoln', 'County', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'cattle', 'baron', 'named', 'Dolan', 'who', 'formed', 'alliance', 'Murphy', 'bring', 'down', 'Certain', 'members', 'Billy', 'gang', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'when', 'fact', 'live', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'die', 'different', 'circumstances', 'areas', 'L.G', 'Murphy', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'shot', 'real', 'life', 'shortly', 'Lincoln', 'County', 'wars', 'illness', 'accuracy', 'film', 'however', 'gunfight', 'out-house', 'was', 'very', 'accurate', 'was', 'shoot', 'out', 'Sheriff', 'Brady', 'men', 'middle', 'streets', 'Lincoln', 'Young', 'Guns', 'rated', 'R', 'gun', 'violence', 'language', 'brief', 'nudity', 'scene', 'where', 'man', 'gun', 'face', 'man', 'blast', 'exiting', 'out', 'back', 'head', 'easily', 'film', 'rated', 'R.', 'Only', 'one', 'mention', 'F-word', 'used', 'fast', 'speech', 'difficult', 'hear', 'nudity', 'man', 'buttocks', 'up', 'suddenly', 'bathtub.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Young', 'Guns', 'fascinating', 'exciting', 'western', 'full', 'entertainment', 'humor', 'drama', 'well', 'action', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', 'doubt', 'best', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'movie', 'made', 'thus', 'far', 'main', 'criticism', 'making', 'historical', 'killer', 'protagonist', 'bold', 'common', 'move', 'Hollywood', 'known', 'spur']",N/A

More bubble gum than anything else, it's a good film to blow bubbles with until it goes stale.In this version, Billy The Kid (Estevez) finds his way into a half-way house with other young derelicts (Sutherland, Sheen, Phillips, et al.) under the protection of a polished English patron.  After their patron is killed by a competing cattle baron (Jack Palance)and the town's corrupt sheriff, Billy is out for revenge.  Carrying out his vengeance with a little too much zeal, Billy The Kid and his friends are marked as outlaws and must live on the run to survive.Not a terribly great film but it has some good scenes such as the gunfights and the band's peyote experience.

75560,A3DY46ZABF4CMQ,0784011524,"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[1, 1]","Young Guns is a good 80's western directed by Christopher Cain (The Next Karate Kid), and starring brat packers Emilio Estevez (The Breakfast Club), Keifer Sutherland (The Lost Boys), Dermot Mulroney (About Schmidt), Lou Diamond Phillips (La Bamba), Casey Siemaszko (Stand By Me), and Charlie Sheen (Wall Street). The movie also stars Hollywood veterans Terence Stamp (Superman II), and the late Oscar winning actor Jack Palance (City Slickers).Guns follows the trails of the legendary William H. Bonney, also known as Billy The Kid, played by Estevez in his most memorable film role. Bonney is a delinquent who's picked up off the street by rancher John Tunstall, played by Stamp, and disciplined into becoming an educated citizen along with other boys that call themselves the regulators: Doc Scurlock, played by Sutherland, Chavez, played by Phillips, Dick Brewer, played by Sheen, Dirty Steve, played by Mulroney, and Charley, played by Siemaszko. Tunstall is brutally murdered by a group of men belonging to rival Murphy, played by Palance. The boys can't get fair justice through the law because Murphy has connections with the sherrif's office, so they're made deputies and go out to arrest the killers of their master. Bonney, however, decides to take both the law and vengeance in his own hands and leads the pack into a killing spree of revenge. The boys give up their badges and become outlaws.Young Guns features an excellent cast of, then, Hollywood's freshest new talents; over time, of course, neither actor held his own except Sutherland, who's had a successful career as the star of TV drama 24, and Sheen, who appears in slapstick comedies to make a living (e.g. Hot Shots, Scary Movie 3), while the script is made especially to attract younger audiences to watch a modern western, something Clint Eastwood would revive only 4 years later with his Academy Award winning picture Unforgiven.Many people disregard Young Guns as a bad western with young actors who'd better off becoming models. But Young Guns successfully carries the plot, silly it may be or not, and delivers good action sequences and quirky dialogue, especially Emilio Estevez's silly laugh, better than other western films.RecommendedB-",4,"""...you gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean.

Nor is it like the darkly tragic Westerns of the 1970s. In fact, about the only thing that YOUNG GUNS shares with Westerns of the past is that just about all of them like to mess around with and screw up historical accuracy. The movie also has a terrible soundtrack (usual for movies in the 80s) which distracts from one's interest in the film.However, despite it's flaws, YOUNG GUNS remains one of the best Westerns from the ""modern"" era (after Star Wars) and is still entertaining to this day. The movie does portray events in Billy the Kid's life that have been overlooked in many movies about his life, e.g. the murder of Tunstall and the Linoln County Wars. It also stars a cast of actors that at the time of filming were considered by many women to be ""hotties"". Despite their sex appeal, these actors were able to bring to life some difficult characters in a totally believable and memorable fashion.The film moves at a believable pace and is full of action and gunfights. Athough the film is full of cheesy dialogue, the movie does have some great one-liners and memorable scenes (e.g. killing the man in the outhouse and the draw with the man in the bar).
