Manilow was definitely &quot;on&quot;; every note rang like a bell, he projected, he emoted, he changed the versions of the original recordings to keep you in suspense.Medley of &quot;This One's For You&quot; and &quot;Trying To Get The  Feeling&quot; cannot be improved upon--they're that good.  &quot;Weekend In  New England&quot; shows the man's genius as he injects Debussy-like  substitute chords into the introduction. And at the end, watch for the most  incredible rapport between performer and audience as the crowd  &quot;mirrors&quot; his sighing. Truly magic.Great stage production, he  is not reluctant to let the talent around him do their thing. Extremely  tightly-knit band with superb drummer who gives the music everything it  needs.

347609,AM6SOTOKGRZGA,6302967376,Jerry McDaniel,"[6, 6]","if nobody knew by now, the UK loves Barry Manilow in a way the U.S. never did. It's a funny thing: he sold more albums in the U.S. but he had the most positive support from the UK. THAT don't make too much sense unless us Manilow fans here in the U.S. ignore bad reviews and judge for ourself. this video is great...i give it 4 stars because he tries to cram in too much material, resulting in all the medley's here. The first two selections aren't even medleys or full length, just a line or two at best. the concert, filmed in London in April 1993, shows us why he spent the majority of the '80s on tour in the UK and around the English-speaking world. He tells us that the UK radio stations &quot;have class&quot; when he makes reference to the 1982 song &quot;Stay&quot; only being a hit in England...this is all done in fun, however. &quot;Avenue C&quot; can't be understood...there's too much Billy the Kidd, too. In reference to the ones who had complaints, this video was recorded on film...not videotape...that's why the picture looks grainy or dull...videotape is shiny and bright like the &quot;Manilow Live&quot; video from 2000. i loved the performances of &quot;Copacabana&quot;, &quot;Im Your Man&quot;, &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot;, &quot;Weekend in New England&quot;, &quot;Looks Like We Made It&quot;, &quot;A Little Travelin Music Please&quot;, and &quot;I Write the Songs&quot;...the version of &quot;Could It Be Magic?&quot; on this video is the 1993 UK up-tempo version. Manilow also showcases the Garth Brooks song &quot;If Tomorrow Never Comes&quot; and later closes with a performance of &quot;The Best of Me&quot;. These two songs were also featured on the massive box set from 1992 called &quot;The Complete Collection and then Some...&quot; and this is partially why the video has the title &quot;The Greatest Hits and then Some...&quot; as a marketing device.",4,the UK experience,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,1890,"['nobody', 'knew', 'now', 'UK', 'Barry', 'Manilow', 'way', 'U.S.', 'never', 'did', 'funny', 'thing', 'sold', 'more', 'albums', 'U.S.', 'had', 'most', 'positive', 'support', 'UK', 'THAT', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'Manilow', 'fans', 'here', 'U.S.', 'ignore', 'bad', 'reviews', 'judge', 'ourself', 'video', 'great', 'i', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'material', 'resulting', 'medley', 'here', 'first', 'two', 'selections', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'medleys', 'full', 'length', 'just', 'line', 'two', 'best', 'concert', 'filmed', 'London', 'April', '1993', 'why', 'spent', 'majority', ""'80s"", 'tour', 'UK', 'English-speaking', 'world', 'UK', 'radio', 'stations', 'quot', 'have', 'class', 'quot', 'when', 'reference', '1982', 'song', 'quot', 'Stay', 'quot', 'only', 'being', 'hit', 'England', 'done', 'fun', 'however', 'quot', 'Avenue', 'C', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'understood', 'too', 'much', 'Billy', 'Kidd', 'too', 'reference', 'ones', 'who', 'had', 'complaints', 'video', 'was', 'recorded', 'film', 'not', 'videotape', 'why', 'picture', 'grainy', 'dull', 'videotape', 'shiny', 'bright', 'quot', 'Manilow', 'Live', 'quot', 'video', '2000.', 'i', 'loved', 'performances', 'quot', 'Copacabana', 'quot', 'quot', 'Im', 'Your', 'Man', 'quot', 'quot', 'Send', 'Clowns', 'quot', 'quot', 'Weekend', 'New', 'England', 'quot', 'quot', 'Made', 'quot', 'quot', 'Little', 'Travelin', 'Music', 'Please', 'quot', 'quot', 'Write', 'Songs', 'quot', 'version', 'quot', 'Could', 'Be', 'Magic', 'quot', 'video', '1993', 'UK', 'up-tempo', 'version', 'Manilow', 'also', 'Garth', 'Brooks', 'song', 'quot', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Comes', 'quot', 'later', 'closes', 'performance', 'quot', 'Best', 'Me', 'quot', 'two', 'songs', 'were', 'also', 'featured', 'massive', 'box', 'set', '1992', 'called', 'quot', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'then', 'quot', 'partially', 'why', 'video', 'title', 'quot', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'then', 'quot', 'marketing', 'device']",Greatest Hits Tour [VHS]

347611,A3FY3H6F4249E0,6302967376,Kathy W,"[11, 12]","This is one SUPERFANTASTICONCERT! Done at Wembley Arena, London, in 1993, it is one of the 3 best Barry DVDs I've seen to date. It is a wee bit over 1 1/2 hours of heart-thumpin' foot-stompin' ENERGY!!! Barry just jumps all over the stage on this one when he's not sitting at the piano. He puts the energizer bunny to shame 100 times over. The renditions of the songs are great, as is the quality of the DVD. You will not be disappointed. In between the songs, Barry chit chats with the audience.It begins and ends with a clip of ""The Best of Me.""  As always, Barry sings great songs and medleys, with so much feeling in them. He truly sings with his heart and soul.Included is a fantastic version of one of my all-time Barry favorites ""I Don't Wanna Walk Without You.""  ""Travelin' Medley: A Little Travelin' Music Please,"" is a nice up-beat clip, and he quickly moves into the high-energy ""New York City Rhythm"" (and he's UP!)--and he's bangin' the piano keys. Now he's up again. There he goes! ""Avenue C"" gives off some wild jazz vocals and some movement. Now to ""Jumpin At the Woodside"" and ""Bandstand Boogie."" The crowd is going wild!This video is done so well, that when Barry is sitting at the piano, he makes you feel like you have a chair on stage, right in front of him while he's singing to you.  You're so close, that you can see the water rolling down his face. There is also the high-energy ""Copacabana"" and another of my favorites ""Stay,"" an absolutely beautiful song. Barry says it was only a hit in England. I don't know why. It's so pretty and so sexy! It's not on many of his CDs either.  London is lovin' it and singin' along. What an awesome showman he is! That was an extended version of ""Stay"".  ""If Tomorrow Never Comes,"" a beautiful Garth Brooks song, is also included (...if tomorrow never comes, will she know how much I love her...), absolutely beautiful words and music. The very upbeat version of ""Could It Be Magic."" Oh this one is soooo good! And he's up! and wigglin' all over the stage! Holy cow! The crowd is goin' wild! This clip alone is worth the price of the video.  There is also a high-energy version of ""I'm Your Man"".Barry looks great in this one. The London crowd obviously LOVES Barry. He gives 120 % and they give it right back to him in applause. The musical and vocal accompaniment is also great. This is a high-energy performance and a great DVD to have. Ok. I'm going to bed now. It's midnight.  Whew! Whaddahperformance! Whaddahshowman. Whaddahguy! Goodnight Chet. Goodnight John Boy.
