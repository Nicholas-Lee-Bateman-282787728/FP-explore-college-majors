Brown,"[3, 4]","...And that is not hyperbole.It might seem strange to say that there are some shows that are just ""too good"" to survive for long on TV, but Wiseguy was one of them. This was not your standard cop show; for one thing shows were done in arcs; there were stand-alone episodes of Wiseguy but very few. You HAD to follow the show week-to-week, meaning that anyone who came in after the first or second episodes, might have been lost. That right there pretty much guaranteed a short shelf life. But along with that was that every episode came loaded with excellently-acted characters, layered with engrossing subplots and peppered with details that may have seemed small at first, but came to be more realized as the story progressed. The show developed a small, but loyal cult audience, out of pure logic. You couldn't be a ""casual viewer."" of Wiseguy. You were either in all the way or you weren't.Ken Wahl's character works for the ""OCB"" (yes the FBI of course) and infiltrates NY mobsters; these are the same guys Vinnie grew up around all his life, guys his dad knew, etc, and he can't help but become empathetic towards Sonny Steelgrave, a cocky, Napoleonic type guy quickly making his way up the ladder.The final ending of the saga is somewhat predictable, but the method and the sweeping dramatics are what will keep you riveted for the final chapter titled ""No One Gets Out Alive"". Its one of the greatest single shows in TV in my humble opinion. Hopefully, if this sells well, they'll put out the arc featuring Kevin Spacey as a psychotic, paranoid crime kingpin. This is truly something to keep in your collection forever. It's hard to believe this came from Stephen J.

In the day when they are releasing whole years of a series in a block on DVD at once, WISEGUY is optioning (more money honey) to package the WISEGUY in the Arcs.  They were conceived to follow one storyline for around 13 episodes.  The first of the arcs was Sonny Steelgrave (Ray Sharkey).  Sharkey gives his roll of a lifetime performance as the mobster Vinnie Terranova is assigned to investigate.  Vinnie comes from the background where mobs were the norm, so his gaining Steelgrave's confidence is not hard.  Keeping it is another matter.  Steelgrave is paranoid when anything is mentioned about the FBI and sees agents lurking everywhere.  Soon Vinnie is getting sucked into actually liking the man he is sent to bring down.Keeping Vinnie on the even keel and reminding him what he is there to do is Frank McPike Jonathan Banks and his check-in contact Lifeguard or ""Uncle Mike"" Jim Byrnes (Highlander).  The writing is crisp and incisive, no black and whites drawn in characters, just a thousand shades of grey.Forewarned, music changes were made due to contacts which hurt the anticipation of people who know the series well...ie...NO Nights in White Satin ending.

754060,AA4YZE8ZV7J5B,B00009L502,DSR,"[15, 17]","Foolishly, I trusted that the term ""complete"" when applied to arcs and/or seasons meant just that. It doesn't--at least not to Cannell and company. Those who loved this ahead-of-its-time series will be disappointed to find that the pivotal moment of the Sonny Steelgrave arc--the confrontation between Sonny and Vinnie with the classic ""Nights in White Satin"" playing over the scene--is gone. What's left is an edited version of the scene with canned music. The production company claims that it would cost too much to include the song. But pinching pennies didn't stop them from charging more for this set of the Steelgrave arc than most production companies charge for an entire season of an hour-long drama. To give the illusion that you're getting your money's worth, the producers of this and the Mel Profitt boxed set sometimes include only one or two episodes on a disk just to bulk up the set. Episodes are also out of sequence. Both sets include stand-alone episodes from later in the series that have nothing to do with these arcs and omit stand-alone episodes that continue these story lines. From the reviews I've read, it seems that later sets in the series are even lower in quality.I recently watched a biography of Stephen Cannell in which he talked about his love of writing, etc., and dedication to his work. That's hard to believe. ""Wiseguy"" was the series that gave him the critical acclaim he supposedly craved, and the ""Nights in White Satin"" scene was one of its most creative moments.

You can still find copies of that ep with KNIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN on the web, ebay, etc - but what a shame not to have it here - what a shame. I suspect they will only do the first season since they never got the music rights for the music arc which was the 2nd season - so - this is a dubious but interesting project and i will be curious to see if there are any extras at all - that said - I hope i'm wrong about all of this - but somehow I don't think I am.

754062,A228NBNLYJ8V3J,B00009L502,Eran Cohen,"[49, 59]","I'm delighted to find out that part one of the first season of Wiseguy is due to be released on DVD. It's almost certain that we're dealing here with the Sonny Steelgrave arc alone, on account of the set's total time of 600 minutes that suffices to include 10-11 episodes only.General background -------------------------Wiseguy tells the story of Vincent Terranova (played by Ken Wahl), a.k.a Vinnie, who had been originally assigned to the Undercover Agents plan of the O.C.B (Organized Crime Bureau), and was sent to prison for a year and a half to substantiate his cover as a criminal, in the eyes of the under world. The story starts as he gets out of jail, and it becomes clear that his purpose in life is to bring down the crime barons of the U.S. The figures that help and support him are Frank McPike (Jonathan Banks), his supervising officer and the lifeguard 'Uncle Mike Terranova' also known as Daniel Benjamin Burroughs (Jim Byrnes). This program is divided into story arcs of varying lengths with regulars and new characters appearing in each arc.The uniqueness of Wiseguy is embedded in its rare treatment of the negative characters; a common person could earn a rare glimpse into the world in which people are so different from himself - yet so much alike - and sometimes understand and identify with their problems and actions.The Steelgrave Arc -----------------------All the above is told primarily in regard to this arc, which is the best of the series; the arc's remarkable cast and its outstanding performance, superb storyline and multidimensional characters, sadness and, ultimately, striking significance make it unmatched compared to all the arcs that followed it. Masterfully orchestrated action scenes are also an important factor that adds a lot to the appeal of this arc.And, yes, Ray Sharkey - without him it couldn't be the same. Ray Sharkey probably gives the roll of his lifetime with the portrayal of Sonny Steelgrave - the crime boss of New Jersey - as one of the most humane characters ever to be seen on television. His actions and motives, for good or ill, are understood and almost justified in the eyes of the viewer. The battle between right and wrong was never so strong, confusing and challenging.It is clear, after a few chapters, that the major issue is actually the decline of the Steelgrave empire. The weakness and vulnerability of Sonny become the center of the series, as the viewer sees how everybody in the underworld wants to get a piece of his crumbling realm. His racketeering enterprises, relatively small time crimes and drug distribution become minor as he has to face his formidable enemies with the help of Vinnie, that becomes his right hand, and that is also doomed to be his Brutus.Episode overview:---------------------Pilot (episodes 1 & 2) - this is the classic opening of the series.  Right in the beginning you'll witness the release of Vinnie from the Newark State Penitentiary, a scene to be shown from that point on in the monumental opening theme by Mike Post. In a remembered early scene Vinnie initiates first contact with Sonny - and the rest is history; most of the major characters are presented and from that point on things start rolling pretty fast. In all, the foundations of the story are put in place, not without puberty hardships that would be amended later on.New Blood - an unforgettable episode, in which the characters of Sonny and of Vinnie are engaged in one of the zeniths of their relationship's development process. From that point on you'll be captured by the charm of this arc to the end. Originally, I'd seen this episode first (and saw the pilot after quite sometime) and it left an unfading impact on me - definitely not for the last time.The loose canon - in my money, one of the weakest in this arc, though quite interesting. We're starting to see how the lies affect Vinnie's life, but there were better episodes to illustrate this angle. The action scene in which Vinnie is shooting some bad guys while standing in a limousine is one of the most memorable of the series.The birthday surprise - a redundant episode that presents two formidable villains - The Zhoratso's. You might also remember the funny name Kiki Vanno after watching this one.One on one - a memorable episode with Annette bening. It has an especially thrilling scene in which Sonny almost reveals Vinnie's cover, and a hard scene about the tortures and then rescue of Frank McPike from captivity.Prodigal son - a strong episode in which Vinnie tells his mother, that has been in the dark regarding his true occupation, that he is a Fed. Another aspect of Sonny's weakness, humanity and compassion is revealed.A deal's a deal - one of the best episodes ever, originally it was made after the arc was finished, when the producers had decided to add a little more to the overall scheme of things; the three major points of interest here are the astounding attempt made by corrupt police officers to expose Vinnie's cover, the setting of the stage for the final conclusion and the introduction of Joey Romanauski, the real life singer Billy Vera. The song he sings, ""Ronnie's song"", is one of the best I've ever heard, partly, I guess, because of the emotions this episode generated in me. Evidently - top notch performances of all the players involved. The lesson learned in this episode (which is embedded in its name) is one not to be forgotten.The marriage of heaven and hell - the name refers to the upcoming wedding of Sonny with Teresa Baglia, the daughter of a has-been crime boss, mostly in order to strengthen Sonny's position in the eyes of the underworld. There is a complicated and messy betrayal triangle in the story, that leads to the arc's climax in the next episode. I remember being totally shocked and confused seeing the developments in this episode. However, it is nothing compared to the occurrences of the next episode.No one gets out of here alive - this is one of the most significant episodes - and probably the saddest - in the history of television. The most ill-fated finale of all times will always be a sad monument to everything this story is about: friendship, trust, loyalty and betrayal, choices, the different points of view people have and of how confusing the distinction between right and wrong, good and bad, true and false can be. The interweaving of the song ""Nights in white satin"" right before the horrific end will forever remind me of the true sadness and loss I felt during and after the heartbreaking and devastating conclusion.",5,The best TV show - finally on DVD.,1054598400,"06 3, 2003",2003,6545,"[""'m"", 'delighted', 'find', 'out', 'part', 'one', 'first', 'season', 'Wiseguy', 'due', 'be', 'released', 'DVD',

Even Ken Wahl must have been frustrated by this when he got his comp set, as the 2 episodes on the set are 2 of his most favorite, and even he can't watch them without listening to himself talk over it!The only good thing about this set is disc 3, which has the great Washington, DC story arc.  However, Cannell messed that up, too, as the opening title credit sequence features the one from the prior storyline, whereas I clearly remember that the DC episodes had a title sequence featuring characters from that arc!And finally, more music has been replaced, as Ken Wahl HIMSELF points out on his commentaries!What a cheap, shoddy job--I will not be fooled into buying further volumes of this series (and there are supposedly 2 more to come!)

754067,A10872FHIJAKKD,B00009L502,Just Bill,"[31, 38]","When Wiseguy first aired, I was hooked from the first episode.Over the years, I often wondered if that show would ever appear again.Now that it has, I almost wish it hadn't. And I'll give you two reasons why:1. The price. The first installment is priced at $52.49 -- a respectable amount for an entire season of a TV show. But a ridiculous sum given that it's just for PART of the first season. The second half of the first season will cost another $52.49, bringing the total to well over $100 for a single season. To my knowledge, only The X-Files has commanded a pricetage that high per season. Wiseguy, although a great TV show, isn't worth over $100 for a single season.2. The controversy regarding Nights in White Satin. I really, really detest it when DVDs are released that differ from how they originally aired (hear that Spielberg and Lucas?). I almost bought the complete Gumby and Pokey DVD set until I discovered the original music was missing. As much as I enjoyed Gumby and Pokey as a kid, I couldn't bring myself to shell out a dime for lame DVDs that don't contain the original musical score.The same goes for Wiseguy.The fact that Wiseguy doesn't include Nights in White Satin when it originally contained that crucial song is enough on its own to make me not buy this set.

Once the story gets rolling, however, I found that I enjoyed it as much as I remembered.  Ray Sharkey's performance is extraordinary.Like other reviewers here, I was waiting for &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; in the last episode, and until I checked here, I was wondering if perhaps I remembered it wrong.  Well, it's a relief to find out my memory hasn't deteroriated yet.  However, it's a shame that music rights issues still cause so many problems.I wouldn't be too quick to blame the Moody Blues, or any other artist.  Very often the artists have nothing to do with these decisions.  Also, the producers very likely wanted to include the original songs, but the licensing demands may have made the cost of production prohibitive...yes?In the last few years, especially since DVD was introduced, film and TV productions routinely negotiate the music rights at the time of production, so that it doesn't become an issue in future video releases.  Since this wasn't a practice in earlier days, we unfortunately get stuck with compromises like this one.Frankly, I always thought the use of &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; was somewhat bizarre and incongruous, since it's such a romantic piece... but that's doubtless why I remember the original scene so well.  I guess I'm lucky that's the only change that I notice (it is pretty glaring).From what I've read it's not the creative people (like Stephen Cannell or the Moody Blues) who put up these roadblocks.  There are plenty of greedy &quot;suits&quot; who control the rights, and a director or producer may not be able to say &quot;boo&quot; to them.  (They're probably the kind of people Sonny Steelgrave hangs out with...)For me it's worth it to have these shows in my collection.  It's fun to revisit the days when a story &quot;arc&quot; was something new (it's become the rule today).  The writing and acting are first-rate, and as for the music... well, the original theme is still catchy!",4,It's Aged Well,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,2083,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'episodes', '15', 'years', 'took', 'one', 'two', 'hours', 'get', 're-accustomed', 'mid-80s', 'style', 'TV', 'story', 'rolling', 'however', 'found', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'remembered', 'Ray', 'Sharkey', 'performance', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'was', 'waiting', 'quot', 'Nights', 'White', 'Satin', 'quot', 'last', 'episode', 'checked', 'here', 'was', 'wondering', 'perhaps', 'remembered', 'wrong', 'Well', 'relief', 'find', 'out', 'memory', ""n't"", 'deteroriated', 'yet', 'However', 'shame', 'music', 'rights', 'issues', 'still', 'cause', 'so', 'many', 'problems.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'quick', 'blame', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'other', 'artist', 'Very', 'often', 'artists', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'decisions', 'Also', 'producers', 'very', 'likely', 'wanted', 'include', 'original', 'songs', 'licensing', 'demands', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'cost', 'production', 'prohibitive', 'yes', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'especially', 'DVD', 'was', 'introduced', 'film', 'TV', 'productions', 'routinely', 'negotiate', 'music', 'rights', 'time', 'production', ""n't"", 'become', 'issue', 'future', 'video', 'releases', 'was', ""n't"", 'practice', 'earlier', 'days', 'unfortunately', 'get', 'stuck', 'compromises', 'one.Frankly', 'always', 'thought', 'use', 'quot', 'Nights', 'White', 'Satin', 'quot', 'was', 'somewhat', 'bizarre', 'incongruous', 'such', 'romantic', 'piece', 'doubtless', 'why', 'remember', 'original', 'scene', 'so', 'well', 'guess', ""'m"", 'lucky', 'only', 'change', 'notice', 'pretty', 'glaring', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'not', 'creative', 'people', 'Stephen', 'Cannell', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'who', 'put', 'up', 'roadblocks', 'are', 'plenty', 'greedy', 'quot', 'suits', 'quot', 'who', 'control', 'rights', 'director', 'producer', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'quot', 'boo', 'quot', ""'re"", 'probably', 'kind', 'people', 'Sonny', 'Steelgrave', 'out', 'worth', 'have', 'shows', 'collection', 'fun', 'revisit', 'days', 'when', 'story', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'something', 'new', 'become', 'rule', 'today', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'first-rate', 'music', 'well', 'original', 'theme', 'still', 'catchy']",Wiseguy - Sonny Steelgrave and the Mob Season 1 Part 1
754069,A17L46G09NDR6K,B00009L502,"Laurie C. Davis ""lcdtiger""","[6, 7]","I remember how much I loved the show, ""Wiseguy"", when it was on in the late 80's, and I was thrilled to finally get the first season on DVD.  It is a powerful show that was very well done, in the quality of a big screen movie on the small screen.  The writing is excellent.  Instead of special effects and stunts, the show was character driven and the story arcs were well developed.  ""Wiseguy"" was created by Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo.  Cannell is well known for his amazing work in many successful series including ""Hunter"", `Rockford Files"" and ""A-Team"".Ken Wahl became his character, Vinnie Terranova.  Vinnie, an undercover agent for the Organized Crime Bureau, struggled with the fine line between the crime he worked to bring down and the people behind it.  He goes so far undercover that the work takes an emotional toll on him and with the help of his field supervisor, Frank McPike (played by Jonathan Banks) and ""Lifeguard"" (played by Jim Brynes)-Vinnie works through his demons.The first season has two story arcs.  The show built its'characters around a specific crime syndicate that Vinnie infiltrates and works to destroy the crime within.  The first story arc centers around a crime syndicate led by Sonny Steelgrave (probably the best role of Ray Sharkey's career).  Following this story, you experience along with Vinnie-the difficulties of his work, his alienation from his family and all that is dear to him.  Even at the final confrontation between Vinnie and Sonny, an amazing scene well acted by Wahl and Sharkey, you see the struggle.  In this scene, Vinnie tells Sonny that, ""it never occurred to me that we would be friends.  There is a lot in you I felt close to"".  In other scene with his mother, she tells Vinnie (to help him gain perspective on his relationship with Steelgrave), ""What good is it when a man loves his own children but kills someone else's"".In the second story, Kevin Spacey portrays Mel Proffit, a psychopath, who heads an international drug and arms business with his sister, Susan.  Vinnie gets entangled with these two and their hired gun, Roger LoCocco (played well by William Russ).  The best way to describe Mel Proffit-Sonny Steelgrave is a saint compared to him.  This character will give you chills and Spacey nails him beautifully.Re-watching the first season of ""Wiseguy"" was very enjoyable-very intense and compelling series that I am thrilled to have in my library.  If you like a well written and well acted crime drama that will keep your attention, you can't go wrong with ""Wiseguy"".One note of caution, the packing of this newly released first season is not very good. All you get is a box with the four enveloped DVDs-there are no bonus materials or extra text with the set.  I watched it all and the DVDs play fine.  The 22 episodes are complete and I am pleased with the quality.  As with the sound, I didn't have any problems. Even without all the ""bells and whistles"", the show is worth purchasing this set.",5,"""Intense & compelling crime drama""",1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,2984,"['remember', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'show', 'Wiseguy', 'when', 'was', 'late', '80', 'was', 'thrilled', 'finally', 'get', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'powerful', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'quality', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'small', 'screen', 'writing', 'excellent', 'Instead', 'special', 'effects', 'stunts', 'show', 'was', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'arcs', 'were', 'well', 'developed', 'Wiseguy', 'was', 'created', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'Frank', 'Lupo', 'Cannell', 'well', 'known', 'amazing', 'work', 'many', 'successful', 'series', 'including', 'Hunter', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'A-Team', '.Ken', 'Wahl', 'became', 'character', 'Vinnie', 'Terranova', 'Vinnie', 'undercover', 'agent', 'Organized', 'Crime', 'Bureau', 'struggled', 'fine', 'line', 'crime', 'worked', 'bring', 'down', 'people', 'so', 'far', 'undercover', 'work', 'emotional', 'toll', 'help', 'field', 'supervisor', 'Frank', 'McPike', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Banks', 'Lifeguard', 'played', 'Jim', 'Brynes', '-Vinnie', 'demons.The', 'first', 'season', 'two', 'story', 'arcs', 'show', 'built', ""its'characters"", 'specific', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'Vinnie', 'destroy', 'crime', 'first', 'story', 'arc', 'centers', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'led', 'Sonny', 'Steelgrave', 'probably', 'best', 'role', 'Ray', 'Sharkey', 'career', 'Following', 'story', 'experience', 'along', 'Vinnie-the', 'difficulties', 'work', 'alienation', 'family', 'dear', 'Even', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Vinnie', 'Sonny', 'amazing', 'scene', 'well', 'acted', 'Wahl', 'Sharkey', 'see', 'struggle', 'scene', 'Vinnie', 'Sonny', 'never', 'occurred', 'would', 'be', 'friends', 'lot', 'felt', 'close', 'other', 'scene', 'mother', 'Vinnie', 'help', 'gain', 'perspective', 'relationship', 'Steelgrave', 'What', 'good', 'when', 'man', 'own', 'children', 'someone', 'else', 'second', 'story', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Mel', 'Proffit', 'psychopath', 'who', 'international', 'drug', 'arms', 'business', 'sister', 'Susan', 'Vinnie', 'entangled', 'two', 'hired', 'gun', 'Roger', 'LoCocco', 'played', 'well', 'William', 'Russ', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'Mel', 'Proffit-Sonny', 'Steelgrave', 'saint', 'compared', 'character', 'will', 'give', 'chills', 'Spacey', 'beautifully.Re-watching', 'first', 'season', 'Wiseguy', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable-very', 'intense', 'compelling', 'series', 'am', 'thrilled', 'have', 'library', 'like', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'crime', 'drama', 'will', 'keep', 'attention', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Wiseguy', '.One', 'note', 'caution', 'packing', 'newly', 'released', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'get', 'box', 'four', 'enveloped', 'DVDs-there', 'are', 'bonus', 'materials', 'extra', 'text', 'set', 'watched', 'DVDs', 'play', 'fine', '22', 'episodes', 'are', 'complete', 'am', 'pleased', 'quality', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'Even', 'bells', 'whistles', 'show', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'set']",Wiseguy - Sonny Steelgrave and the Mob Season 1 Part 1

Vinnie and Frank cementing their friendship, which began so hesitantly in the Profitt arc, is terrific. The bad guys aren't as likable in this arc, but maybe it's fun now and then to have someone to gleefully boo and hiss at.The Rag Trade arc is great for any number of reasons. The tortured trio of Beckstead, Raglin, and McPike show us with their nightmares of longlasting guilt that Vinnie isn't alone -- in fact he has it pretty easy... Jerry Lewis hams it up fine, and Ron Silver's always good. Stanley Tucci's versatility always amazes me. This is a classic textbook case of Murphy's Law; it should've been a cut-and-dried case that Vinnie could easily tie up; after all he'd been brought in by one of the principals and the crime boss was all eagerness in believing his cover if no other reason than his mom's recent marriage to Don Aiuppo. But step by step everything that can go wrong does, the arc ends with most of the principals dead and the ones that survive are broken. It's almost Shakespearean in its tragedy.The standalones are a lot of fun. It's wonderful to see the characters and what they're like when they're off duty, although it seems that Frank McPike is NEVER off duty in his own mind. However this is where the shortcomings of the DVD set become apparent. Again the music has been changed -- McPike's murder of the jukebox in &quot;Stairway&quot; is never as effective without &quot;Hit the Road, Jack&quot; triggering (pardon the pun) his ire. Ken Wahl's commentary seems limited to griping about the guy playing the doctor or the network itself. I'd have liked to hear more about other stuff such as how the money went from being carefully shrink-wrapped to completely unwrapped and back to shrink-wrapped again over a few scenes or how they managed to tilt that chair up against the fridge without killing anybody...or for that matter what the weather was like in Vancouver since there's snow on the ground and steam coming from everyone who breathes. &quot;White Noise&quot; is great because it's good to see Sonny again, albeit with a bad perm, but don't buy Vinnie's casual brush-off of the ghost; Sonny will haunt Vinnie again next season. &quot;Romp&quot; I have little to say about; it's a pointless episode written to fill a slot as far as I can see, and the most interesting thing about &quot;Reunion&quot; -- aside from the incredibly stupid woman cop whose last great act of defiance ranks right up there with the stupid Klingon in Star Trek III -- is the fact that the lovable dufus Mooch is the same guy in &quot;Where's the Money&quot; who threateningly towers over Frank McPike and commits the capital sin &quot;do you know you have your hand on me?&quot;I confess to wishing there had been more special features -- an interview with Stanley Tucci or Jerry Lewis would've been great. I resent that we STILL don't have subtitles.

My impressions back then were that they were awesome.Fifteen years of build-up, and y'know, they ARE pretty damn good.Taken as a mini-series, the Steelgrave arc blows most mid-80's TV out of the water. HBO series, like &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, build their tension and craft their storylines around 12 or 13 episodes &quot;arcs&quot; to this very day.While the whole Mob &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; stuff has been done to death by pretty much everybody, nobody has captured a relationship like Sonny and Vinnie on film.You will find sympathy for the murderer, and the betrayer in this case is the &quot;good guy&quot;. Your own feelings will be mixed, echoing Vinnie's. Nifty accomplishment for a &quot;crime melodrama TV series&quot;, don't ya think? The writing and plotting here is top-notch.Ray Sharkey is justifiably celebrated for his role here, and Ken Wahl clearly is doing the role of his career (as it would prove to be). Jonathan Banks and Ed Byrnes offer flawless support.Caveats are few. Pretty much every female role is awful, and often embarassing. Every line from &quot;Gina Augustina's&quot; mouth is flat-out terrible, for example. Beginning with her name. And yes, the 80's hairstyles are a hoot. They are the reason widescreen television was invented.Reading about &quot;Nights In White Satin&quot;, I'm saddened that it was not included. I agree, it must have been something to see/hear. It's time for these &quot;music rights&quot; issues to be settled. If a film was butchered and sold without the creator's permission, the performing arts community would be up in arms. Now we must slice up the soundtrack because certain greedy individuals need even more money? Listen, you agreed once to have it in the film. Leaving it in will only sell you MORE records, not less.

I've heard that there have been problems getting the rights to the music in that arc. Maybe that's why they aren't included.

There were some notable exceptions during the Garment District arc. In some of these, the audio was out of sync with the video by as much as a half second. In another episode, the video was very jerky, almost like watching a video online. This was on a TiVo where the entire season had been downloaded to the hard drive.There was one other thing that I found very annoying - the volume level was not consistent between episodes. Some were so faint that we had to crank up the stereo. And, of course, the following episodes would be much louder so we'd have to scramble for the remote to turn it down.If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this package.

The second arc (which I actually saw before I saw the Steelgrave arc) featured a then-unknown actor named Kevin Spacey who was as memorable as in his performance as Ray Sharkey was in his.

What you had was a combination of actors and writers literally at the best of their respective games.  Ken Wahl was brilliant--he gave both physical presence and a conflicted soul to Vinnie Terranova.  Wahl, along with Jonathan Banks as the hangdog Frank McPike and Jim Byrnes as Dan Burroughs (aka Lifeguard) formed a holy trinity of sorts as this arc went on; with Vinnie and McPike butting heads early, but developing a strong respect and liking for each other as it went on.  There also isn't enough that can be said about Stephen Cannell's writing throughout the arc.  This may well have been his Magnum Opus (I mean, really--compared with The A-Team?  21 Jump Street?  Silk Stalkings?).  Plus, that this was the series that introduced the ""arc""--taking the nine episodes to tell the complete tale (which has evolved now to telling stories over a whole season with many series) revolutionized series television.Still, the heft of this arc comes from the great Ray Sharkey.  In retrospect, it seems typical that a man this good at his art was as consumed as he was off-camera.  For those who only know Sharkey from his magnificent turn as the loyal, dangerous (and ultimately paranoid) gangster Sonny Steelgrave, I've got two words for you--""The Idolmaker"".  Find a copy of this film (1981, I believe).  Sharkey had a touch of greatness about himself, truly.But again, there were stunning performances throughout this arc--Dennis Liscomb's snarky accountant Sid Royce, Annette Benning's turn as the undercover (with Royce) operative (Yeah, they shouldn't have used her name on the liner), Joe Dallesandro's Pat ""The Cat"" Patrice--who thought he had Sonny boxed in until Sonny sprung that surprise on him in ""The Marriage Of Heaven And Hell"", and Eric Christmas' Harry the Hunchback...this was a set where everyone connected was at the absolute pinnacle of their game, and it showed through the whole set of episodes.It is unfortunate, however, that SOMEONE dropped the ball on ""No One Gets Out Of Here Alive"".  Forget that the episode is basically Vinnie and Sonny--having been exposed to each other as betrayers--are dealing with the ramifications both legal and emotional (The emotional results on Vinnie don't come up until ""White Noise"" in Season 2) of the fallout, leading to Sonny realizing what lay ahead for him...to not have ""Nights In White Satin"" as the background music is just WRONG.  Of course, it sets up a situation where SoundWorks releases a 2nd Edition of this arc and advertises the original music on the cover--think people who got ripped the first time wouldn't get the second edition?But--save the massive disappointment of not having Justin Heyward's voice in the finale of this arc--this is just incredibly brilliant television.",3,How Can You Ruin A Great Memory?,1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,2852,"[""n't"", 'doubt', 'Wiseguy', 'was', 'great', 'television', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'GREAT', 'television', 'What', 'had', 'was', 'combination', 'actors', 'writers', 'literally', 'best', 'respective', 'games', 'Ken', 'Wahl', 'was', 'brilliant', 'gave', 'physical', 'presence', 'conflicted', 'soul', 'Vinnie', 'Terranova', 'Wahl', 'Jonathan', 'Banks', 'hangdog', 'Frank', 'McPike', 'Jim', 'Byrnes', 'Dan', 'Burroughs', 'aka', 'Lifeguard', 'formed', 'holy', 'trinity', 'sorts', 'arc', 'went', 'Vinnie', 'McPike', 'butting', 'heads', 'early', 'developing', 'strong', 'respect', 'liking', 'other', 'went', 'also', ""n't"", 'enough', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Stephen', 'Cannell', 'writing', 'arc', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Magnum', 'Opus', 'mean', 'really', 'compared', 'A-Team', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'Silk', 'Stalkings', 'was', 'series', 'introduced', 'arc', 'taking', 'nine', 'episodes', 'tell', 'complete', 'tale', 'evolved', 'now', 'telling', 'stories', 'whole', 'season', 'many', 'series', 'revolutionized', 'series', 'television.Still', 'heft', 'arc', 'great', 'Ray', 'Sharkey', 'retrospect', 'typical', 'man', 'good', 'art', 'was', 'as', 'consumed', 'was', 'off-camera', 'who', 'only', 'know', 'Sharkey', 'magnificent', 'turn', 'loyal', 'dangerous', 'ultimately', 'paranoid', 'gangster', 'Sonny', 'Steelgrave', ""'ve"", 'got', 'two', 'words', 'Idolmaker', 'Find', 'copy', 'film', '1981', 'believe', 'Sharkey', 'had', 'touch', 'greatness', 'truly.But', 'again', 'were', 'stunning', 'performances', 'arc', 'Dennis', 'Liscomb', 'snarky', 'accountant', 'Sid', 'Royce', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'turn', 'undercover', 'Royce', 'operative', 'Yeah', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'used', 'name', 'liner', 'Joe', 'Dallesandro', 'Pat', 'Cat', 'Patrice', 'who', 'thought', 'had', 'Sonny', 'boxed', 'Sonny', 'sprung', 'surprise', 'Marriage', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'Eric', 'Christmas', 'Harry', 'Hunchback', 'was', 'set', 'where', 'everyone', 'connected', 'was', 'absolute', 'pinnacle', 'game', 'showed', 'whole', 'set', 'episodes.It', 'unfortunate', 'however', 'SOMEONE', 'dropped', 'ball', 'No', 'One', 'Out', 'Here', 'Alive', 'Forget', 'episode', 'basically', 'Vinnie', 'Sonny', 'having', 'been', 'exposed', 'other', 'betrayers', 'are', 'dealing', 'ramifications', 'legal', 'emotional', 'emotional', 'results', 'Vinnie', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'White', 'Noise', 'Season', '2', 'fallout', 'leading', 'Sonny', 'realizing', 'what', 'lay', 'ahead', 'not', 'have', 'Nights', 'White', 'Satin', 'background', 'music', 'just', 'WRONG', 'course', 'up', 'situation', 'where', 'SoundWorks', '2nd', 'Edition', 'arc', 'original', 'music', 'cover', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'got', 'ripped', 'first', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'second', 'edition', 'save', 'massive', 'disappointment', 'not', 'having', 'Justin', 'Heyward', 'voice', 'finale', 'arc', 'just', 'incredibly', 'brilliant', 'television']",Wiseguy - Sonny Steelgrave and the Mob Season 1 Part 1

When you add in the incredible actors they had working on it, it is unbeatable. I was over the moon when I heard it was coming out on DVD. Then I heard that some of the music from the series was to be cut -- most notably ""Nights in White Satin"" by the Moody Blues. This is disappointing, as the musical selections were well made, heightening the mood wonderfully. And now I see that what I thought was going to be a set of the full first season is probably only the first half? Admittedly, I haven't checked the prices of every TV show on DVD out there, but compared with other things I have purchased this seems to be running about twice what other sets cost. I was planning on ordering this right away, but now I am hesitant. I think I am going to wait to hear the reviews in case there are other things I should know about before investing quite so much money.*****[Added later]  I've just had a chance to look at this new package.  It's really pretty in hand, and the transfers look good.  The ""gag reel"" is pretty mediocre as these things go, and doesn't seem to warrant all the warnings (danger: offensive material) leading up to it.  One gem:  the interview with Jonathan Banks is great.  He's an incredibly underrated actor (mostly by people who only ever saw him in ""Otherworlds"" and ""Cold Steel"").  I haven't yet had the courage to watch the scenes with their music changed.I'd like to know something, though -- just how quickly was this put together?  The final Ray Sharkey ep is listed as ""No One Get's Out of Here Alive""  (Get's?????), and there are no chapter breaks in any of the episodes.  That just seems sloppy.  I won't gripe about Annette Bening's name on the box -- it's just there to sell an extra copy or two.  I also don't understand the choice to add ""People Do It All The Time"" and ""Meet Mike McPike"" as the extras.  Sure, they're standalone eps, but they come from much later in the series.
