1650992,A3CPJYAQMCUGNR,B00CU2RNVA,Chris Matthews,"[3, 7]","In various reviews and within the movie itself there are references to homage paid to Indiana Jones. Having no interest in seeing an ""Indiana Jones"" movie, I am unable to understand the reference.With that said, this is a delightful movie.As an unwed father of seven kids with two more on the way, I try to keep a fresh stock of enjoyable movies for the kids to watch and leave me alone when they come over.There is a mute bird in the movie with an endless supply  of comedic commentary signs that he (assuming it's a ""he"") pulls out of somewhere to express himself during any given moment.  A similar act seen in ""Monster in Paris"" and ""Pirates! Band of Misfits"" to name a couple.At one point, I did have to stop the movie to explain a certain scene to the kids. The female protagonist, Sara kissed the dog Jeff on the back of his head while Tad is holding him. For an instant, Tad looks down at Jeff's crotch and then up at Sara as she is walking away realizing Jeff's ""affection"" for Sara as well.Other unspoken instances of props and body language will be directing the viewers attention to Sara's generous assets throughout the movie.A refreshing movie to see in what is often an over-hyped market for movies put out by the other major studios. Often times, actually seeing the movie feels more redundant than novel after the hype surrounding the movie leaves little new material to enjoy.",5,Dog lipstick,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,1394,"['various', 'reviews', 'movie', 'are', 'references', 'homage', 'paid', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Having', 'interest', 'seeing', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movie', 'am', 'unable', 'understand', 'reference.With', 'said', 'delightful', 'movie.As', 'unwed', 'father', 'seven', 'kids', 'two', 'more', 'way', 'try', 'keep', 'fresh', 'stock', 'enjoyable', 'movies', 'kids', 'watch', 'leave', 'alone', 'when', 'come', 'over.There', 'mute', 'bird', 'movie', 'endless', 'supply', 'comedic', 'commentary', 'signs', 'assuming', 'somewhere', 'express', 'given', 'moment', 'similar', 'act', 'seen', 'Monster', 'Paris', 'Pirates', 'Band', 'Misfits', 'name', 'couple.At', 'one', 'point', 'did', 'have', 'stop', 'movie', 'explain', 'certain', 'scene', 'kids', 'female', 'protagonist', 'Sara', 'kissed', 'dog', 'Jeff', 'back', 'head', 'Tad', 'holding', 'instant', 'Tad', 'down', 'Jeff', 'crotch', 'then', 'up', 'Sara', 'walking', 'away', 'realizing', 'Jeff', 'affection', 'Sara', 'well.Other', 'unspoken', 'instances', 'props', 'body', 'language', 'will', 'be', 'directing', 'viewers', 'attention', 'Sara', 'generous', 'assets', 'movie.A', 'refreshing', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'often', 'over-hyped', 'market', 'movies', 'put', 'out', 'other', 'major', 'studios', 'Often', 'actually', 'seeing', 'movie', 'more', 'redundant', 'novel', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'little', 'new', 'material', 'enjoy']","Tad: The Lost Explorer ( Las aventuras de Tadeo Jones ) ( Les aventures de Tadeo Jones ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Germany ]"

1650996,AIO247KHD2O40,B00CU2RNVA,James N Simpson,"[9, 12]","Tad the Lost Explorer is a pretty fun 88 minute animated film whose main character is a tribute to the Junior character from Indiana Jones. It's a kids' movie but has plenty of references to movies adults will have seen in their youth and jokes that will probably go over the heads of kids (because their supposed to) but adults will smile at.  Like most kids movies the human heroes have their animal sidekicks.  Tad has his dog and the main female character Sara (who when she takes off her formal shirt and appears in the top she is wearing on the cover, changes Tad's mind to go on this risk his life adventure) has a mute parrot who communicates with Wile-E Coyote type wooden signs.  Even if kids (or yourself) haven't seen the Indiana Jones films, they'll still understand this but it's fun watching this and thinking, oh yeah that's playing homage to that scene from that movie.  Tad the Explorer does have a plot of its own too.Since the product page at the time of this review doesn't list one I'll outline the basic plot but there are some spoilers from the start of the film here. Tad was a bit of a loner as a kid, raised by his grandma and always wanted to be an archaeologist which obviously earned him a lot of ridicule from neighbourhood kids.  But Tad is a good natured guy and just rolled with it along with his fear of mummies, and has continued to do so in his current construction industry jobs as a very clutsy adult.  I say jobs as he can't seem to keep them, always getting distracted by what treasures the construction team unearths at the sites which he takes to the museum where a good natured professor has taken pity on him and humours each find, even though a shelf shows them to be anything but artefacts.  The professor has also just discovered a letter that has gotten delayed along the way with a ticket telling him to bring his half of a mysterious tablet to South America that departs in hours.  Tad does his friend a favour and drives him to the airport but inadvertently injures the man in the departure lounge and doesn't correct the flight attendant who assumes he is the professor since he is holding the boarding pass who rushes him onto the flight.  When he arrives he finds out pretending to be the professor is a very risky thing to do be doing when snatched by typical movie type villains, including a guy with a claw hand giving a nice homage to Mad from Inspector Gadget who wants the tablet.  Luckily Tad escapes and wants no further part of this but changes his mind and teams up with the letter sender's daughter due to lust, after a change of her outfit, to find her father and bring the tablet to him. Of course the villains aren't going to give up either.The animation is pretty good, your modern 3D style, originally this wasn't an English language film but obviously since it's a cartoon you don't need to worry about lip movements not matching voices and so on.  The movie does follow your typical kids' movie clich&eacute;s and therefore has a bit of predictability to it, which is further enhanced by some scenes being a homage to the Indiana Jones franchise, but it is certainly one of the more fun animated movies to be released in the last couple of years and definitely one that adults will have no problem sitting through or even watching without kids.",5,Fun South American Set Animated Adventure Which Gives a Nice Tribute to the Indiana Jones Movies,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,3317,"['Tad', 'Lost', 'Explorer', 'pretty', 'fun', '88', 'minute', 'animated', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'tribute', 'Junior', 'character', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'kids', 'movie', 'plenty', 'references', 'movies', 'adults', 'will', 'have', 'seen', 'youth', 'jokes', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'heads', 'kids', 'supposed', 'adults', 'will', 'smile', 'most', 'kids', 'movies', 'human', 'heroes', 'have', 'animal', 'sidekicks', 'Tad', 'dog', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'Sara', 'who', 'when', 'formal', 'shirt', 'top', 'wearing', 'cover', 'Tad', 'mind', 'go', 'risk', 'life', 'adventure', 'mute', 'parrot', 'who', 'Wile-E', 'Coyote', 'type', 'wooden', 'signs', 'Even', 'kids', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'films', ""'ll"", 'still', 'understand', 'fun', 'watching', 'thinking', 'oh', 'yeah', 'playing', 'homage', 'scene', 'movie', 'Tad', 'Explorer', 'have', 'plot', 'own', 'too.Since', 'product', 'page', 'time', 'review', ""n't"", 'list', 'one', ""'ll"", 'outline', 'basic', 'plot', 'are', 'spoilers', 'start', 'film', 'here', 'Tad', 'was', 'bit', 'loner', 'kid', 'raised', 'grandma', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'archaeologist', 'obviously', 'earned', 'lot', 'ridicule', 'neighbourhood', 'kids', 'Tad', 'good', 'natured', 'guy', 'just', 'rolled', 'along', 'fear', 'mummies', 'continued', 'do', 'so', 'current', 'construction', 'industry', 'jobs', 'very', 'clutsy', 'adult', 'say', 'jobs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'always', 'getting', 'distracted', 'what', 'construction', 'team', 'unearths', 'sites', 'museum', 'where', 'good', 'natured', 'professor', 'taken', 'pity', 'humours', 'find', 'even', 'shelf', 'be', 'anything', 'artefacts', 'professor', 'also', 'just', 'discovered', 'letter', 'gotten', 'delayed', 'way', 'ticket', 'telling', 'bring', 'half', 'mysterious', 'tablet', 'South', 'America', 'hours', 'Tad', 'friend', 'favour', 'airport', 'inadvertently', 'man', 'departure', 'lounge', ""n't"", 'correct', 'flight', 'attendant', 'who', 'professor', 'holding', 'boarding', 'pass', 'who', 'flight', 'When', 'out', 'pretending', 'be', 'professor', 'very', 'risky', 'thing', 'do', 'be', 'doing', 'when', 'snatched', 'typical', 'movie', 'type', 'villains', 'including', 'guy', 'claw', 'hand', 'giving', 'nice', 'homage', 'Mad', 'Inspector', 'Gadget', 'who', 'tablet', 'Luckily', 'Tad', 'escapes', 'further', 'part', 'mind', 'teams', 'up', 'letter', 'sender', 'daughter', 'due', 'lust', 'change', 'outfit', 'find', 'father', 'bring', 'tablet', 'course', 'villains', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'give', 'up', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'modern', '3D', 'style', 'originally', 'was', ""n't"", 'English', 'language', 'film', 'obviously', 'cartoon', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'worry', 'lip', 'movements', 'not', 'matching', 'voices', 'so', 'movie', 'follow', 'typical', 'kids', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'therefore', 'bit', 'predictability', 'further', 'enhanced', 'scenes', 'being', 'homage', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'franchise', 'certainly', 'one', 'more', 'fun', 'animated', 'movies', 'be', 'released', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'definitely', 'one', 'adults', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'sitting', 'even', 'watching', 'kids']","Tad: The Lost Explorer ( Las aventuras de Tadeo Jones ) ( Les aventures de Tadeo Jones ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Germany ]"
