The title character is a tense and tough member of a group of criminals who hangs out at a local bar and goes to rich neighborhoods to rob vulnerable mansions under the protection of iron gates.  Tsotsi is quiet with an undercurrent of raw violence that is ready to erupt at the drop of a hat.  At one point, he pummels in a friend's face after having a disagreement at the bar.One day he and a friend rob a wealthy man's house, and he is caught by the wife whom Tsotsi shoots and steals her car.  He flees without his friend, only to find her baby in the back seat of the car.  Gentle as a presence but complicating his life, the baby brings feelings of tenderness to the surface, so he uses his gangster methods to force a neighbor to take care of the infant.  The experience also elicits his own memories that show his own vulnerablity, and so by taking care of the baby, in some ways he recognizes his own needs.'Tsotsi' is by all means an absorbing movie with tense and believable performances all around.  While it goes to the heart of every urban culture, the update of post-Mandela South Africa shows that, even when social justice is presented, some needs go unmet and bubbling below the surface.",5,Needy for the Milk of Human Kindness,1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,1402,"['great', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'universality', 'love', 'gone', 'wrong', 'experience', 'jaundiced', 'youth', 'also', 'nice', 'update', 'post-apartheid', 'Johanesberg', 'South', 'Africa', 'title', 'character', 'tense', 'tough', 'member', 'group', 'criminals', 'who', 'out', 'local', 'bar', 'rich', 'neighborhoods', 'rob', 'vulnerable', 'mansions', 'protection', 'iron', 'gates', 'Tsotsi', 'quiet', 'undercurrent', 'raw', 'violence', 'ready', 'erupt', 'drop', 'hat', 'one', 'point', 'friend', 'face', 'having', 'disagreement', 'bar.One', 'day', 'friend', 'wealthy', 'man', 'house', 'caught', 'wife', 'whom', 'Tsotsi', 'shoots', 'steals', 'car', 'friend', 'only', 'find', 'baby', 'back', 'seat', 'car', 'Gentle', 'presence', 'complicating', 'life', 'baby', 'feelings', 'tenderness', 'surface', 'gangster', 'methods', 'force', 'neighbor', 'take', 'care', 'infant', 'experience', 'also', 'own', 'memories', 'show', 'own', 'vulnerablity', 'so', 'taking', 'care', 'baby', 'ways', 'own', 'needs', ""'Tsotsi"", 'means', 'absorbing', 'movie', 'tense', 'believable', 'performances', 'around', 'heart', 'urban', 'culture', 'update', 'post-Mandela', 'South', 'Africa', 'even', 'when', 'social', 'justice', 'presented', 'needs', 'go', 'unmet', 'bubbling', 'surface']",Tsotsi

In a carjacking, Tsotsi shockingly discovers and is left with an infant separated from his mother, injured by Tsotsi.  He innocently attempts to hold on to the baby, tenderly, sweet, caring and vulnerable in the midst of gang activity. It is this time that the ganster undergoes a remarkable awakening.  The actor Presley  Cheweneyagae was outstanding, revealing every emotion on his face.The film directed by Gavin Hood is based on a novel by Athol Fugard.  It has minimal dialogue, which means the viewer relies on descriptive settings, perfect transitions, emotional faces,  close-ups, realistic actions and most of all touching the viewer.  It's clear to see why this got the 2005 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and numerous other awards.Features!The DVD subtitles are easily legible, and as I mentioned, there isn't a lot of dialogue, which means we can't lose too much in translation like other films.The Making of Tsotis and Audio CommentaryAlso included is an English speaking version of the making of Tsotsi.  Excellent audio commentary is informative, insightful and educational with alternative endings.Don't miss the extraordinary short filmWhat is included is a short film, also by Gavin Hood, that is so unique in that there are  no speaking roles, we rely only on what we see, what we interpret with only a few noises.  The film is the Shopkeeper,  where an old man runs a small store that has repeatedly been broken into.  See what he does next.Soundtrack - the music toward the end!It's not the rap music I noticed, but what was so soothing, spiritual, and haunting was the music at the end of the film, subtle but powerful.  ....Excellent film.

987753,A20HNT8HYIYY0X,B000FC2FX8,"Adrian Stranik ""Ade""","[0, 0]","Following on the ragged coat tails of previous award stormer's such as La Haine and City of God, Tsotsi also deals with marginalised youth gangs fighting for survival, respect and... decency. A tale of redemption amid the hopeless poverty of a Soweto township the film, based on Athol Fugard's novel, tells the story of a teenager who has consigned his past and future to the dumpster and is known only as Tsosti which, roughly translated, means hoodlum or thug.In the aftermath of a robbery Tsotsi finds he has inadvertently stolen a baby. He takes it back to his shack where his inept attempts to look after the child force him to seek out a local girl who has recently given birth. This girl, also a victim of local lawlessness, (her husband having recently been murdered) is forced by Tsotsi to feed the child. This Madonna-esque epiphany in the midst of this urban hell hole triggers Tsotsi's journey back from the brink of damnation to retrieve his lost identity and to risk all by returning the child to its family.Presley Chweneyagae's (try saying that after a stiff Pimms) portrayal of the young gangster is at once brilliant and alarming with a permafrost glare that often suggests an unsettling femininity. The subsequent replacing of his black leather jacket for a crisp white shirt as he begins his path to redemption is somewhat trite though, but when he takes the child to the top of a hill overlooking the distant city with a gospel choir singing under a nearby tree gives us one of the films most powerful moments - for the first time we see the possibility of beauty in a landscape that has hitherto been impossibly hideous.Just as powerful is the film's soundtrack.  In the early 80's there was much talk of `world music' and how African music in particular was about to be the next big thing. I suppose my own prejudices led me to expect an unholy marriage of Adam and the Ants and the Tarzan theme tune, when, in fact, it all sounded a bit saccharine-loaded and unexpectedly twee, and the `next big thing' became little more than the soundtrack of countless Yuppie dinner parties. Twenty years later African music may be about to gain a real foothold on the world stage due to Tsotsi's extensive use of Kwaito - a pan afro/house hybrid that merges Western electronica with the idiosyncratic grooves of post-apartheid South African Ghettos. Language barriers notwithstanding, Kwaito has the kind of attitude and swagger that really could connect with foreign audiences - and lets not forget - it was the film Blackboard Jungle which heralded in the Rock and Roll era of the 1950's and changed the world.Adrian Stranik",4,Baby let's play house...,1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,2637,"['Following', 'ragged', 'coat', 'tails', 'previous', 'award', 'stormer', 'such', 'La', 'Haine', 'City', 'God', 'Tsotsi', 'also', 'marginalised', 'youth', 'gangs', 'fighting', 'survival', 'respect', 'decency', 'tale', 'redemption', 'hopeless', 'poverty', 'Soweto', 'township', 'film', 'based', 'Athol', 'Fugard', 'novel', 'story', 'teenager', 'who', 'consigned', 'past', 'future', 'dumpster', 'known', 'only', 'Tsosti', 'roughly', 'translated', 'hoodlum', 'thug.In', 'aftermath', 'robbery', 'Tsotsi', 'inadvertently', 'stolen', 'baby', 'back', 'shack', 'where', 'inept', 'attempts', 'look', 'child', 'force', 'seek', 'out', 'local', 'girl', 'who', 'recently', 'given', 'birth', 'girl', 'also', 'victim', 'local', 'lawlessness', 'husband', 'having', 'recently', 'been', 'murdered', 'forced', 'Tsotsi', 'feed', 'child', 'Madonna-esque', 'epiphany', 'midst', 'urban', 'hell', 'hole', 'Tsotsi', 'journey', 'back', 'brink', 'damnation', 'retrieve', 'lost', 'identity', 'risk', 'returning', 'child', 'family.Presley', 'Chweneyagae', 'try', 'saying', 'stiff', 'Pimms', 'portrayal', 'young', 'gangster', 'once', 'brilliant', 'alarming', 'permafrost', 'glare', 'often', 'unsettling', 'femininity', 'subsequent', 'replacing', 'black', 'leather', 'jacket', 'crisp', 'white', 'shirt', 'path', 'redemption', 'somewhat', 'trite', 'when', 'child', 'top', 'hill', 'overlooking', 'distant', 'city', 'gospel', 'choir', 'singing', 'nearby', 'tree', 'one', 'films', 'most', 'powerful', 'moments', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'possibility', 'beauty', 'landscape', 'hitherto', 'been', 'impossibly', 'hideous.Just', 'powerful', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'early', '80', 'was', 'much', 'talk', 'world', 'music', 'how', 'African', 'music', 'particular', 'was', 'be', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'suppose', 'own', 'prejudices', 'led', 'expect', 'unholy', 'marriage', 'Adam', 'Ants', 'Tarzan', 'theme', 'tune', 'when', 'fact', 'sounded', 'bit', 'saccharine-loaded', 'unexpectedly', 'twee', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'became', 'little', 'more', 'soundtrack', 'countless', 'Yuppie', 'dinner', 'parties', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'African', 'music', 'may', 'be', 'gain', 'real', 'foothold', 'world', 'stage', 'due', 'Tsotsi', 'extensive', 'use', 'Kwaito', 'pan', 'afro/house', 'hybrid', 'Western', 'electronica', 'idiosyncratic', 'grooves', 'post-apartheid', 'South', 'African', 'Ghettos', 'Language', 'barriers', 'notwithstanding', 'Kwaito', 'kind', 'attitude', 'swagger', 'really', 'could', 'connect', 'foreign', 'audiences', 'not', 'forget', 'was', 'film', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'heralded', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'era', '1950', 'changed', 'world.Adrian', 'Stranik']",Tsotsi
987754,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000FC2FX8,Alistair McHarg,"[5, 8]","Not to be confused with the Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange vehicle, Tsotsi is, in essence, a South African take on City Of God - with important differences.  City Of God was a brilliant descent into Rio's teenage gang life, visually mesmerizing and authentic.  Tsotsi shares the ability to take its viewers to a truly otherworldly environment, in this case the sub-culture of Johannesburg's shantytown.  (There are many unforgettable images, including the cement culverts that Tsotsi once called home.)  The movie succeeds on this level.Not to belabor the point, Tsotsi steals a car, shoots the car's owner in the abdomen, and discovers a baby in the back seat.  (Just recently his gang has savagely murdered a commuter for beer money.)  At this point, if Tsotsi really were Tsotsi, he would either leave the baby to die or drop it off in front of an affluent-looking house.  But the film needs its gadget, so - ridiculously - he keeps the infant.  Even the dimmest viewer will deduce that Tsotsi's inability to provide care reflects a childhood that was, to say the least, unkind.  Viewers understand that when Tsotsi looks at the innocent child he sees himself, and so, for the first time, develops some semblance of humanity.  (No one will be seated during the ""mother forced to nurse another woman's offspring at gunpoint"" scene!)One can feel sorrow, even empathy, for a young punk so crippled that he believes all problems can be solved with violence or money.  One can look at the landscapes of deprivation and squalor and wonder, ""If I had to endure that, would I have morals, or would I pack steel and live a life of savage social Darwinism?""  These are good questions, and the vivid photography and sense of place encourage viewers to ask them.  But the metamorphosis, or at least, nascent metamorphosis, of Tsotsi from brutal street thug to inept, conscience-driven nanny is beyond nutty, it belongs in the province of fairy tales.",3,Tso-Tso-Tsotsi Goodbye,1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,1940,"['Not', 'be', 'confused', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'vehicle', 'Tsotsi', 'essence', 'South', 'African', 'take', 'City', 'God', 'important', 'differences', 'City', 'God', 'was', 'brilliant', 'descent', 'Rio', 'teenage', 'gang', 'life', 'visually', 'mesmerizing', 'authentic', 'Tsotsi', 'shares', 'ability', 'take', 'viewers', 'truly', 'otherworldly', 'environment', 'case', 'sub-culture', 'Johannesburg', 'shantytown', 'are', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'images', 'including', 'cement', 'Tsotsi', 'once', 'called', 'home', 'movie', 'level.Not', 'belabor', 'point', 'Tsotsi', 'car', 'shoots', 'car', 'owner', 'abdomen', 'baby', 'back', 'seat', 'Just', 'recently', 'gang', 'savagely', 'murdered', 'commuter', 'beer', 'money', 'point', 'Tsotsi', 'really', 'were', 'Tsotsi', 'would', 'either', 'leave', 'baby', 'die', 'drop', 'off', 'front', 'affluent-looking', 'house', 'film', 'gadget', 'ridiculously', 'infant', 'Even', 'dimmest', 'viewer', 'will', 'deduce', 'Tsotsi', 'inability', 'provide', 'care', 'childhood', 'was', 'say', 'least', 'unkind', 'Viewers', 'understand', 'when', 'Tsotsi', 'innocent', 'child', 'so', 'first', 'time', 'semblance', 'humanity', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'seated', 'mother', 'forced', 'nurse', 'woman', 'offspring', 'gunpoint', 'scene', 'One', 'can', 'feel', 'sorrow', 'even', 'empathy', 'young', 'punk', 'so', 'crippled', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'solved', 'violence', 'money', 'One', 'can', 'look', 'landscapes', 'deprivation', 'squalor', 'wonder', 'had', 'endure', 'would', 'have', 'morals', 'would', 'pack', 'steel', 'live', 'life', 'savage', 'social', 'Darwinism', 'are', 'good', 'questions', 'vivid', 'photography', 'sense', 'place', 'encourage', 'viewers', 'ask', 'metamorphosis', 'least', 'nascent', 'metamorphosis', 'Tsotsi', 'brutal', 'street', 'thug', 'inept', 'conscience-driven', 'nanny', 'nutty', 'province', 'fairy', 'tales']",Tsotsi
987755,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000FC2FX8,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[3, 4]","Intrigued by this film's trailer (which I saw several times), I finally rented it, and was very pleasantly surprised. It was not what I'd expected, and had the added advantage of resting on the firm foundation of an Athol Fugard novel. I've seen several Fugard plays (including Master Harold...and the Boys, 1987; and Blood Knot, 1964) and have always found his work excellent.Presley Chweneygae gives an outstanding performance as Tsotsi, a Soweto hooligan who thinks nothing of committing theft and murder, which for him are all in a night's work, with his three followers, Soekie (Thembi Nyandeni), Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe) and Boston (Mothusi Magano). The last of these is the most recent recruit; Boston gets sick when Butcher silently murders a businessman in a packed subway car, with an ice pick. When the car empties of passengers at the last stop, the men steal their victim's wallet and run.Boston, though, won't have it. While they sip their beer back at their usual hangout, he lambastes Tsotsi for his lack of conscience. Doesn't he have any respect, Boston asks. Tsotsi's response: to beat Boston's face to a pulp and run out alone in the rain. There, while fleeing from Soweto into the main town, Tsotsi experiences the first of many flashbacks. In this one, he remembers fleeing as a child along the same path, also in the rain, towards a large stack of abandoned water main pipes piled outside Soweto. As he approaches, he sees today's street kids, living on their own in the same way he once did. Only later do we learn the details of his flight from home.With the first remembrance of his early life Tsotsi begins to move towards conscience; but it takes his shooting a young woman, Pumla Dube (Nambitha Mpumlwana), as she returns home with her groceries and waits at her driveway entrance for her husband to open their gate, to push his transition into high gear. Tsotsi steals her car to get away, leaving her to die in the street, and several miles out of town, is shocked to hear the woman's infant son crying in the back seat. Tsotsi skids to a crash halt, packs up the groceries, unfastens the baby's car seat restraints, puts him in the grocery bag and heads home.Suddenly, he has responsibility. And suddenly, he remembers the comfort of his mother's love. He remembers her illness, his father's angry control over her and him, his life when he was called David, and the pain of having to choose between loosing his mother and staying with a father so brutal that he broke the spine of David's dog's with one kick.Of course, Tsotsi arrives at accepting responsibility for what he has done, along with whatever punishment he has coming, only after twisting and turning along a ragged journey that first brings him to apologize to his friend Boston, to Miriam (Terry Pheto), the woman he coerced into breast feeding the child, to a crippled old man he had abused, and ultimately to the people he hurt most.This process gratifies viewers with a sense of Tsotsi's moral triumph, against all odds. But that does not come without tragedy---true tragedy, the result of poor human choices, and the pain of Tsotsi and his victims. Moreover, for all his welcomed remorse, Tsotsi is hardly exonerated. The film embraces ethics, and encourages personal responsibility. A winner, despite the tragic losses portrayed.--Alyssa A.

Then after beating one of his gang nearly to death, he goes out and steals a car, shooting the woman who tries to tear the door open as he drives away. Then he learns, she was trying to get to her child who is in a babyseat in the back.This is when the film takes a turn.

987757,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000FC2FX8,Andrew Ellington,"[15, 21]","One of those films that everyone seems to admire, `Tsotsi' is a film that I can't rally behind.  I have to speak my piece here and contribute an opinion that differs from the masses that seem to have nothing but praise and admiration for this film.  Gavin Hood's film is stylishly directed and shot, and it is pretty well acted; but the script is a very, very week point that brings the film down to a mediocre level, diminishing the very moral that Hood was trying to bring to the light.It somewhat contradicts itself.This may contain some SPOILERS so be forewarned.In `Tsotsi', Hood tells us the story of David, a thug who enforces his status by killing mercilessly and even going as far as to beat his friends if he feels his dignity is in question.  He has apparently no morals whatsoever so when we see him pull out a gun and shoot a woman for her car, it doesn't faze us because we expect this from him.  What happens next is a tad unexpected.  David realizes that there is a baby in the backseat.Now, I'm not trying to judge because, well, I don't like to do that, but Hood creates a monster in David that he seems quick to try and dispel.  David immediately decides to care for this child.  This didn't make much sense to me, since David's personality was not of the nurturing kind, and all too often we read of actually people of this persuasion who would kill a child as apposed to care for it; so his decision makes little sense, especially in the immediacy of it all.  What happens next though is an even bigger question mark.  It's apparent that Hood has now changed our central character from a merciless killer to a nurturing would-be-father who apparently cares for the boy, but he then depicts David breaking into the home of the parents in order to rob them for necessary items to care for the boy.  This is another headscratcher.  So he starts off a monster, then he suddenly shifts into a caring person but then, in order to be `caring' he pains the same family he's already nearly destroyed by robbing them at gunpoint.  It was at that point in the film that I lost any and all respect for the story.  I was finally starting to wrap my head around the idea of this young man maybe being more conflicted than evil, more conditioned than anything else, and that maybe this young baby brought another side of him to light; but the decision to rob the boy's parents of all people was one that I could never understand.  Then he pulls yet another one-eighty and delivers the baby to the parents.  It's almost as if Hood wasn't sure what kind of person David really was.He's a menace, but he's sentimental, but he evil, yet he's moral, but he corrupt yet he does the right thing...Hmmmm.Then, on top of it all, the final confrontation with the cops and the parents and David is presented in a way where we feel almost manipulated to actually feel sorry for David.  This was a sick joke in my book, for if Hood actually thinks that this character is a representation of purity in a maniacal environment then he is sadly mistaken.  Hood presents David's eventual decision as if it were the eraser taken to his actions, as if he was redeeming himself by presenting this baby to his parents.  If he had never entered the families home with gun in hand in order to steal their child's belongings I would walk away feeling that maybe this young mans full-circle transformation was genuine, but actions speak louder than words, and Hood should have known that.That said, Presley Chweneyagae does a fine job portraying David, and he shifts through the range of emotions (as unstable and uneven as they are) with ease, so I cannot knock him.  He actually brings more to the table than the script called for, and so I actually praise him for his efforts.  It's a shame that the script was not up to this young mans potential.I cannot recommend this film, for to me it is an inaccurate depiction of a tragedy and it attempts to rationalize in a way that is nearly offensive.  To sympathize with David, after all that he has done, is a crime in many ways for the script never allows us to truly invest in his transformation.  He doesn't prove his heart to us, but Hood makes sure that we see his faux variation of change in those last few frames.  If you are easily persuaded by manipulated expressions of redemption then you may very well flock to David's defense; but hopefully you're smart enough to see that Hood wasn't smart enough to make this work.",1,"A manipulative, calculated and inaccurate mess...",1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,4458,"['One', 'films', 'everyone', 'admire', 'Tsotsi', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rally', 'have', 'speak', 'piece', 'here', 'contribute', 'opinion', 'masses', 'seem', 'have', 'nothing', 'praise', 'admiration', 'film', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'film', 'stylishly', 'directed', 'shot', 'pretty', 'well', 'acted', 'script', 'very', 'very', 'week', 'point', 'film', 'down', 'mediocre', 'level', 'diminishing', 'very', 'moral', 'Hood', 'was', 'trying', 'bring', 'light.It', 'somewhat', 'itself.This', 'may', 'contain', 'SPOILERS', 'so', 'be', 'forewarned.In', 'Tsotsi', 'Hood', 'story', 'David', 'thug', 'who', 'status', 'killing', 'mercilessly', 'even', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'beat', 'friends', 'dignity', 'question', 'apparently', 'morals', 'whatsoever', 'so', 'when', 'see', 'pull', 'out', 'gun', 'shoot', 'woman', 'car', ""n't"", 'faze', 'expect', 'What', 'next', 'tad', 'unexpected', 'David', 'baby', 'backseat.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'judge', 'because', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', 'Hood', 'monster', 'David', 'quick', 'try', 'dispel', 'David', 'immediately', 'care', 'child', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'David', 'personality', 'was', 'not', 'nurturing', 'kind', 'too', 'often', 'read', 'actually', 'people', 'persuasion', 'who', 'would', 'kill', 'child', 'apposed', 'care', 'decision', 'little', 'sense', 'especially', 'immediacy', 'What', 'next', 'though', 'even', 'bigger', 'question', 'mark', 'apparent', 'Hood', 'now', 'changed', 'central', 'character', 'merciless', 'killer', 'nurturing', 'would-be-father', 'who', 'apparently', 'boy', 'then', 'David', 'breaking', 'home', 'parents', 'order', 'rob', 'necessary', 'items', 'care', 'boy', 'headscratcher', 'monster', 'then', 'suddenly', 'caring', 'person', 'then', 'order', 'be', 'caring', 'same', 'family', 'already', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'robbing', 'gunpoint', 'was', 'point', 'film', 'lost', 'respect', 'story', 'was', 'finally', 'starting', 'wrap', 'head', 'idea', 'young', 'man', 'maybe', 'being', 'more', 'conflicted', 'evil', 'more', 'conditioned', 'anything', 'else', 'maybe', 'young', 'baby', 'brought', 'side', 'light', 'decision', 'rob', 'boy', 'parents', 'people', 'was', 'one', 'could', 'never', 'understand', 'Then', 'yet', 'one-eighty', 'baby', 'parents', 'almost', 'Hood', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'David', 'really', 'was.He', 'menace', 'sentimental', 'evil', 'moral', 'yet', 'right', 'thing', 'Hmmmm.Then', 'top', 'final', 'confrontation', 'cops', 'parents', 'David', 'presented', 'way', 'where', 'feel', 'almost', 'manipulated', 'actually', 'feel', 'sorry', 'David', 'was', 'sick', 'joke', 'book', 'Hood', 'actually', 'character', 'representation', 'purity', 'maniacal', 'environment', 'then', 'sadly', 'mistaken', 'Hood', 'David', 'eventual', 'decision', 'were', 'eraser', 'taken', 'actions', 'was', 'redeeming', 'presenting', 'baby', 'parents', 'had', 'never', 'entered', 'families', 'home', 'gun', 'hand', 'order', 'steal', 'child', 'belongings', 'would', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'maybe', 'young', 'full-circle', 'transformation', 'was', 'genuine', 'actions', 'speak', 'louder', 'words', 'Hood', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'said', 'Presley', 'Chweneyagae', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'David', 'range', 'emotions', 'unstable', 'uneven', 'are', 'ease', 'can', 'not', 'knock', 'actually', 'more', 'table', 'script', 'called', 'so', 'actually', 'praise', 'efforts', 'shame', 'script', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'young', 'mans', 'potential.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'inaccurate', 'depiction', 'tragedy', 'rationalize', 'way', 'nearly', 'offensive', 'sympathize', 'David', 'done', 'crime', 'many', 'ways', 'script', 'never', 'truly', 'invest', 'transformation', ""n't"", 'prove', 'heart', 'Hood', 'sure', 'see', 'faux', 'variation', 'change', 'last', 'few', 'frames', 'are', 'easily', 'persuaded', 'manipulated', 'expressions', 'redemption', 'then', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'flock', 'David', 'defense', 'hopefully', ""'re"", 'smart', 'enough', 'see', 'Hood', 'was', ""n't"", 'smart', 'enough', 'make', 'work']",Tsotsi

It's this essence which is exposed when David comes into inadvertent possession of an infant.The DVD extras give you some real insight into Mr. Chweneyagae's acting ability - in the behind-the-scenes featurette, we see him chatting intelligently, accompanied by a broad smile, about how he read the script and expressed an immediate desire to do the role.  To transform that engaging presence into David's initially malevolent, glowering presence on screen...well, that is a fine piece of acting.Another actor worthy of note is Mothusi Magano as 'Boston.'  His failed academic dreams sliding under the weight of alcohol, his lectures on 'decency' are the among the film's best moments.

987761,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000FC2FX8,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[13, 16]","***THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***Many movie reviewers view foreign language films with a smidgin of contempt. There's an underlying current of the ""why do we have to put up with these things"" type mentality, especially from U.S. reviewers. It's not entirely self-evident when reading these reviews, but you get that feeling deep down that American film makers, producers, marketers, and reviewers swallow these foreign film pills with a hint of displeasure. I'm sure much of that discomfort comes from the fact that some of these films drain a certain percentage of money out of their deep pockets. Personally, I say ""More power to `em!""The reason I bring this up is because TSOTSI is one of those films that could've taken off in the American mainstream had it had a significant marketing budget. It did, after all, win multiple film festival awards, snagged the American Film Institutes Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize Special Mention, as well as picking up an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. But because of the mentality of movie makers in the fabulously wealthy Hollywood arena, marketing of these vitally important foreign imports often gets hamstrung in favor of such film dregs as DATE MOVIE and THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN. I don't say these things without any source. Go up and ask your average young adult or teenager about TSOTSI and they'll more often than not simply stare at you as if you'd just requested they give you the mathematical equation for nuclear fission.There's something to be said for these low-budget films (although I'm not sure what TSOTSI's shooting costs were, I feel confident it didn't come close to the two dregs I mentioned above). These little-known gems give us stories that go beyond our normal film viewing range. And TSOTSI is one that I'm proud to say I watched with joy (this is a also disturbing and I'll tell you why in a moment).Tsotsi (Presley Chweneyagae) is a thug in South Africa. He's your typical amoral gangster who doesn't have a shred of ""decency"" in his young body. He also has a group of stragglers who follow him around like puppies, putting pressure on Tsotsi to come up with their evening's entertainment; they steal, they rob, they kill. But one day, when Tsotsi decides to do a job by himself, he makes a moral mistake (and I mean he makes a mistake according to his own moral code, which is to say he causes something good to come out of something terrible). He shoots a woman after stealing her car and drives away with a new BMW. But as he travels awkwardly down the road (he doesn't drive very well) he hears a cooing sound in the backseat. Startled, he turns around and discovers a baby in a carseat. Initially unsure of what to do, he takes the baby home with him and nurtures the child as best he can (which isn't very good). He soon learns that he has to watch the baby closely; ants attack the infant, and it gets hungry and poops constantly and needs to be bathed. Tsotsi forcibly procures the assistance of a widowed neighbor who recently had a child. He convinces the woman -- at gunpoint -- to breast feed the child and threatens to kill her if she tells anyone about him and the baby. A strange relationship develops between these two as the film progresses.Torn by his own poor upbringing, Tsotsi has to decide what to do with the child when he learns that its mother is still alive. The police, too, are closing in on him and his gang of thugs have disbanded. Tsotsi's choice to care for the child has put him on a path of physical destruction, but has also led him to deeper choices, those of compassion and morality.In the end, Tsotsi battles his internal demons in order to make the right choice for the baby, and it's a startling realization. We watch a person we absolutely loathed in the beginning of the film turn ever so slightly into a ""decent"" young man, and it's disturbing as a viewer (for me, at least) to empathize with someone initially devoid of humanity. But that's where TSOTSI succeeds and so many American films fail. American movies want you to see most things in black and white (""Here's the good guy and here's the bad""). But TSOTSI brings us into these lives and does so without spoonfeeding us what's right and what's wrong. The gray areas are sweeping and uncomfortable, something that packs an emotional wallop at the end of the film (I was bubbling like an idiot as tears streamed down my cheeks).TSOTSI deserves the little notoriety it's received. In fact, it deserves much, much more.",5,American Film-Makers ...Eat Your Hearts Out,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,4511,"['***THIS', 'REVIEW', 'MAY', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS***Many', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'view', 'foreign', 'language', 'films', 'smidgin', 'contempt', 'underlying', 'current', 'why', 'do', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'things', 'type', 'mentality', 'especially', 'U.S.', 'reviewers', 'not', 'entirely', 'self-evident', 'when', 'reading', 'reviews', 'get', 'feeling', 'deep', 'down', 'American', 'film', 'makers', 'producers', 'marketers', 'reviewers', 'swallow', 'foreign', 'film', 'pills', 'hint', 'displeasure', ""'m"", 'sure', 'much', 'discomfort', 'fact', 'films', 'drain', 'certain', 'percentage', 'money', 'deep', 'pockets', 'Personally', 'say', 'More', 'power', 'em', 'reason', 'bring', 'up', 'TSOTSI', 'one', 'films', 'could', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'off', 'American', 'mainstream', 'had', 'had', 'significant', 'marketing', 'budget', 'did', 'win', 'multiple', 'film', 'festival', 'awards', 'snagged', 'American', 'Film', 'Institutes', 'Audience', 'Award', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'Prize', 'Special', 'Mention', 'as', 'well', 'picking', 'up', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'mentality', 'movie', 'makers', 'fabulously', 'wealthy', 'Hollywood', 'arena', 'marketing', 'vitally', 'important', 'foreign', 'imports', 'often', 'hamstrung', 'favor', 'such', 'film', 'dregs', 'DATE', 'MOVIE', 'THE', '40', 'YEAR', 'OLD', 'VIRGIN', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'things', 'source', 'Go', 'up', 'ask', 'average', 'young', 'adult', 'teenager', 'TSOTSI', ""'ll"", 'more', 'often', 'not', 'simply', 'stare', ""'d"", 'just', 'requested', 'give', 'mathematical', 'equation', 'nuclear', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'low-budget', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'TSOTSI', 'shooting', 'costs', 'were', 'feel', 'confident', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'two', 'dregs', 'mentioned', 'little-known', 'gems', 'give', 'stories', 'go', 'normal', 'film', 'viewing', 'range', 'TSOTSI', 'one', ""'m"", 'proud', 'say', 'watched', 'joy', 'also', 'disturbing', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'why', 'moment', '.Tsotsi', 'Presley', 'Chweneyagae', 'thug', 'South', 'Africa', 'typical', 'amoral', 'gangster', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'shred', 'decency', 'young', 'body', 'also', 'group', 'stragglers', 'who', 'follow', 'puppies', 'putting', 'pressure', 'Tsotsi', 'come', 'up', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'steal', 'rob', 'kill', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'Tsotsi', 'do', 'job', 'moral', 'mistake', 'mean', 'mistake', 'according', 'own', 'moral', 'code', 'say', 'something', 'good', 'come', 'something', 'terrible', 'shoots', 'woman', 'stealing', 'car', 'away', 'new', 'BMW', 'awkwardly', 'down', 'road', ""n't"", 'drive', 'very', 'well', 'cooing', 'sound', 'backseat', 'Startled', 'around', 'baby', 'carseat', 'Initially', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'baby', 'home', 'child', 'can', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'soon', 'watch', 'baby', 'closely', 'ants', 'attack', 'infant', 'hungry', 'constantly', 'be', 'bathed', 'Tsotsi', 'forcibly', 'assistance', 'widowed', 'neighbor', 'who', 'recently', 'had', 'child', 'woman', 'gunpoint', 'breast', 'feed', 'child', 'kill', 'anyone', 'baby', 'strange', 'relationship', 'two', 'film', 'progresses.Torn', 'own', 'poor', 'upbringing', 'Tsotsi', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'child', 'when', 'mother', 'still', 'alive', 'police', 'too', 'are', 'closing', 'gang', 'thugs', 'have', 'disbanded', 'Tsotsi', 'choice', 'care', 'child', 'put', 'path', 'physical', 'destruction', 'also', 'led', 'deeper', 'choices', 'compassion', 'morality.In', 'end', 'Tsotsi', 'internal', 'demons', 'order', 'make', 'right', 'choice', 'baby', 'startling', 'realization', 'watch', 'person', 'absolutely', 'loathed', 'beginning', 'film', 'turn', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'decent', 'young', 'man', 'disturbing', 'viewer', 'least', 'empathize', 'someone', 'initially', 'humanity', 'where', 'TSOTSI', 'so', 'many', 'American', 'films', 'fail', 'American', 'movies', 'want', 'see', 'most', 'things', 'black', 'white', 'Here', 'good', 'guy', 'here', 'bad', 'TSOTSI', 'lives', 'so', 'spoonfeeding', 'what', 'right', 'what', 'wrong', 'gray', 'areas', 'are', 'sweeping', 'uncomfortable', 'something', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'bubbling', 'idiot', 'tears', 'streamed', 'cheeks', 'little', 'notoriety', 'received', 'fact', 'much', 'much', 'more']",Tsotsi

It seems like it might be a simple movie about a young South African man (subtitled in English) who experiences a profound spiritual awakening upon connecting with an infant who changes his life.Not so simple. Tsotsi is an AIDS orphan, as they are called in South Africa, and of which they are many. He HAS no ability to connect to other human beings, and his life of crime is a testimony to that. He cares about no one - no family, no friends, not even himself.With his connection to the infant that he kidnaps (after shooting the baby's mother while stealing her car to get out of the rain), Tsotsi begins to have flashbacks to his own childhood and his own pain that begin to enlighten the viewer to what we are dealing with here.When Tsotsi meets a young mother and forces her, at gunpoint (!) to ""feed"" the baby he doesn't even know how to feed, we realize how vacant this young man is. But he is beginning to care - enough to get the baby fed - he just doesn't know how.We learn, through this interaction, the powerful gifts that mothers provide for their children in nurture and connection that Tsotsi has never known. He is fascinated, moved, pained, awed - as should we all be.In time, Tsotsi makes the decision to return the baby to its mother, who is still alive, although she will never walk again. Tsotsi realizes what he has taken from them all. He will experience the loss of everything he has never known as he lets this baby go, a baby he has given his own name, David, for as long as he kept him. David, a name he never shared with anybody else, ever. He is beginning to let the world in.One poignant scene involves a visit to where David lived as a child, where other AIDS orphans, growing in number, tell him they can't take the baby because THEY have nothing to feed him. The scene with the children is where the heart-wrenching tale begins to pivot.Highly recommended.Rethinking Aids",5,I loved this movie!,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,1993,"['heart-wrenching', 'movie', 'basically', 'human', 'decenty', 'lack', 'thereof', 'might', 'be', 'simple', 'movie', 'young', 'South', 'African', 'man', 'subtitled', 'English', 'who', 'profound', 'spiritual', 'awakening', 'connecting', 'infant', 'who', 'life.Not', 'so', 'simple', 'Tsotsi', 'AIDS', 'orphan', 'are', 'called', 'South', 'Africa', 'are', 'many', 'ability', 'connect', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'life', 'crime', 'testimony', 'one', 'family', 'friends', 'not', 'even', 'himself.With', 'connection', 'infant', 'shooting', 'baby', 'mother', 'stealing', 'car', 'get', 'rain', 'Tsotsi', 'have', 'flashbacks', 'own', 'childhood', 'own', 'pain', 'begin', 'enlighten', 'viewer', 'what', 'are', 'dealing', 'here.When', 'Tsotsi', 'young', 'mother', 'gunpoint', 'feed', 'baby', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'feed', 'realize', 'how', 'vacant', 'young', 'man', 'beginning', 'care', 'enough', 'get', 'baby', 'fed', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'how.We', 'learn', 'interaction', 'powerful', 'gifts', 'mothers', 'provide', 'children', 'nurture', 'connection', 'Tsotsi', 'never', 'known', 'fascinated', 'moved', 'pained', 'awed', 'should', 'be.In', 'time', 'Tsotsi', 'decision', 'return', 'baby', 'mother', 'who', 'still', 'alive', 'will', 'never', 'walk', 'again', 'Tsotsi', 'what', 'taken', 'will', 'experience', 'loss', 'everything', 'never', 'known', 'baby', 'go', 'baby', 'given', 'own', 'name', 'David', 'as', 'long', 'kept', 'David', 'name', 'never', 'shared', 'anybody', 'else', 'ever', 'beginning', 'let', 'world', 'in.One', 'poignant', 'scene', 'visit', 'where', 'David', 'lived', 'child', 'where', 'other', 'AIDS', 'orphans', 'growing', 'number', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'baby', 'THEY', 'have', 'nothing', 'feed', 'scene', 'children', 'where', 'heart-wrenching', 'tale', 'pivot.Highly', 'recommended.Rethinking', 'Aids']",Tsotsi

The film begins with his gang's murder of a subway rider, a brutal beating of his colleague who dared to raise issues of morality, and then a car-jacking. Tsotsi crashes the new car and finds a newborn baby boy in the back seat. This film won an Oscar for best foreign film, but just at this early point in the film I believe the plot becomes entirely predictable. We know that the little baby will humanize Tsotsi (he does), and that the little guy will be returned safely to his parents (he is). So, the film really hinges on Tsotsi's character development and road to redemption. I also thought the film ended somewhat ambiguously, as perhaps it should have, with Tsotsi's arrest. Director Gavin Hood clearly intends not only to tell a personal story but also to comment on the horrendous socio-economic inequalities in the post-apartheid South African townships that contributed to Tsotsi's life as a criminal.

The movie started similarly, as Tsotsi and his gang commit one unforgettable act of violence, and Tsotsi alienates his gang with another.  From here the movie strayed from its source, to its detriment in my opinion.  Tsotsi becomes responsible for an infant--a responsibility that changes him--hence the redemptive part.  But redemption pushes all the way to the end, muscling out fate--perhaps the filmmakers felt that Fugard's ending just wouldn't stand with moviegoers used to at least some semblance of a happy ending.  In my view they went way too far in this regard, and emasculated the story of much of its power.  Had I not read the book, I might have rated the film a star higher, but knowing what I know about the book, ""Tsotsi"" the film barely rates 3 stars, mostly for the performances of its young cast.

Instead of Rio's favelas, we now have the Soweto shantytowns as the geographic focal point. And instead of the unrelenting visceral intensity of the Brazilian film, director-writer Gavin Hood presents a story that begins with a fearsome veracity but unfortunately settles for a more conventional sense of plot structure and character development.Based on a 1960 novel by Athol Fugard, the story concerns the title character, a teenage ruffian who heads up a gang of four in post-apartheid South Africa. A robbery-turned-stabbing in a subway triggers a lot of unwanted questions for Tsotsi about his past among his fellow gang members. He almost kills his best friend Boston before running away and finding a carjacking opportunity. Violence yet again erupts in this episode, but the surprise is that he finds a baby in the backseat of the car he stole. From that point, the baby becomes a catalyst for Tsotsi's humanistic character transformation, including an initially tense relationship with Miriam, a young widow and mother whom he seeks out to feed the baby.For a film that starts out with such unblinking grittiness, it is surprising and a bit sad to see it evolve into an increasingly sentimental journey even with the jagged edge of violence present throughout. Some scenes, especially toward the last half-hour including an unnecessary flashback, come across as particularly mawkish, even though the ending does generate genuine tension. In his film debut, Presley Chweneyagae is impressive as Tsotsi, even when the script calls for his character to go through some awfully quick changes in short order. Terry Pheto is certainly a becalming presence as Miriam, though it is unclear to me whether the young woman has the welfare of Tsotsi or the baby as her priority. The other gang members are portrayed with acuity - Mothusi Magano as the cerebral Boston, Kenneth Nkosi as the befuddled follower Aap, and Zenzo Ngqobe as the aptly named Butcher.The one aspect that deserves unequivocal praise is Lance Brewer's stunning cinematography which captures the burnished landscape of the shantytowns in vibrant detail. There are several extras with the 2006 DVD that are worth checking out, beginning with Hood's informative commentary and an intriguing 1998 short he made called ""The Storekeeper"". There are several deleted scenes included, but the most interesting are two variations on the final minutes of the film (Hood chose correctly in my opinion). A lively music video of the movie's propulsive opening song, ""Mdlwembe"" by Zola, is also included. It's necessary to use the English subtitle option since the characters are speaking a local dialect called Tsotsi-Taal.",3,Disjointed Journey of Humanistic Reclamation Still Has Isolated Moments of Raw Power,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,2902,"['almost', 'unfortunate', '2005', 'South', 'African', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Fernando', 'Meirelles', 'brutalizing', '2003', 'City', 'God', 'latter', 'film', 'really', 'cinematic', 'standard', 'portraying', 'harsh', 'urban', 'nihilism', 'onscreen', 'Instead', 'Rio', 'favelas', 'now', 'have', 'Soweto', 'shantytowns', 'geographic', 'focal', 'point', 'instead', 'unrelenting', 'visceral', 'intensity', 'Brazilian', 'film', 'director-writer', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'story', 'fearsome', 'veracity', 'unfortunately', 'settles', 'more', 'conventional', 'sense', 'plot', 'structure', 'character', 'development.Based', '1960', 'novel', 'Athol', 'Fugard', 'story', 'title', 'character', 'teenage', 'ruffian', 'who', 'up', 'gang', 'four', 'post-apartheid', 'South', 'Africa', 'robbery-turned-stabbing', 'subway', 'lot', 'unwanted', 'questions', 'Tsotsi', 'past', 'fellow', 'gang', 'members', 'almost', 'best', 'friend', 'Boston', 'running', 'away', 'finding', 'carjacking', 'opportunity', 'Violence', 'yet', 'again', 'erupts', 'episode', 'surprise', 'baby', 'backseat', 'car', 'stole', 'point', 'baby', 'catalyst', 'Tsotsi', 'humanistic', 'character', 'transformation', 'including', 'initially', 'tense', 'relationship', 'Miriam', 'young', 'widow', 'mother', 'whom', 'out', 'feed', 'baby.For', 'film', 'out', 'such', 'unblinking', 'grittiness', 'surprising', 'bit', 'sad', 'see', 'evolve', 'increasingly', 'sentimental', 'journey', 'even', 'jagged', 'edge', 'violence', 'present', 'scenes', 'especially', 'last', 'half-hour', 'including', 'unnecessary', 'flashback', 'come', 'particularly', 'mawkish', 'even', 'ending', 'generate', 'genuine', 'tension', 'film', 'debut', 'Presley', 'Chweneyagae', 'impressive', 'Tsotsi', 'even', 'when', 'script', 'character', 'go', 'awfully', 'quick', 'changes', 'short', 'order', 'Terry', 'Pheto', 'certainly', 'becalming', 'presence', 'Miriam', 'unclear', 'young', 'woman', 'welfare', 'Tsotsi', 'baby', 'priority', 'other', 'gang', 'members', 'are', 'portrayed', 'acuity', 'Mothusi', 'Magano', 'cerebral', 'Boston', 'Kenneth', 'Nkosi', 'befuddled', 'follower', 'Aap', 'Zenzo', 'Ngqobe', 'aptly', 'named', 'Butcher.The', 'one', 'aspect', 'unequivocal', 'praise', 'Lance', 'Brewer', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'burnished', 'landscape', 'shantytowns', 'vibrant', 'detail', 'are', 'several', 'extras', '2006', 'DVD', 'are', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'beginning', 'Hood', 'informative', 'commentary', 'intriguing', '1998', 'short', 'made', 'called', 'Storekeeper', 'are', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'most', 'interesting', 'are', 'two', 'variations', 'final', 'minutes', 'film', 'Hood', 'chose', 'correctly', 'opinion', 'lively', 'music', 'video', 'movie', 'propulsive', 'opening', 'song', 'Mdlwembe', 'Zola', 'also', 'included', 'necessary', 'use', 'English', 'subtitle', 'option', 'characters', 'are', 'speaking', 'local', 'dialect', 'called', 'Tsotsi-Taal']",Tsotsi

It is about the power of love, redemption, and the human spirit. Along the way, TSOTSI opens the door into the world of the impoverished and socially disadvantaged in present day South Africa.  Although much has been seen before, since the conditions of poverty remain universal, TSOTSI reveals a world few of us know in the West.

987774,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B000FC2FX8,Giordano Bruno,"[2, 2]","I rented and watched ""Tsotsi"" because I had just read the novel. I read the novel because I had just seen a stage production of a play by Athol Fugard. I suppose that, if and when a TV series depicting the later life of Tsotsi/David is produced, I'll watch that too.The play was the best. The acting was superb. The script was brilliant, though I personally can't follow Fugard into his religious ecstasy. The novel was an early, unfinished effort by Fugard -- very powerful and revelatory, though the ending was botched badly. The film is only ""freely"" based on the novel, but the ending is still botched. It sentimentalizes the novel excessively, with a soundtrack that should get its music director some kind of cheap plastic Oafscar for banality. I don't know what I might have thought of the film if I hadn't read the book. I don't know what I would have thought of the novel if I hadn't seen a couple of Fugard's later plays. I suspect that I would have been incredulous.The film has definite strengths. The acting is extraordinary; given what he's called upon to do by the director, Presley Chweneyage delivers a topnotch performance as the Thug (Tsotsi means ""thug"" in the South African patois of the film). The supporting roles are even better played. The kidnapped baby should definitely have received a solid gold Oscar for Supporting Actor. The camera delivers also; the images of a ""township"" slum are unforgettable, and the contrasting images of wealth in Johannesburg are like a punch in the stomach. The film Tsotsi updates the novel from the apartheid era of Fugard's youth to the disappointing modern era of AIDS and the uneradicated misery of poverty. But, unlike the novel, the film treats sociological/historical matters only as the periphery of the personal drama of Thug's awakening of ""decency.""That awakening is probably implausible, if you think about it too analytically.

987776,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FC2FX8,Grady Harp,"[8, 8]","TSOTSI is a jewel of a film, well deserving the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film of 2005.  Though set in Johannesburg, South Africa, the story is unfortunately so universal that the film could have been made in any country in the world: the lost children of abusive parents who survive life by relying on crime fill the streets of the poor neighborhoods of all major cities.  TSOTSI is a tragedy but it carries a sense of hope and redemption that makes it a powerful statement indeed.Tsotsi - translated, means 'Thug'- (Presley Chweneyagae) is an amoral youth who heads a gang of four: Boston (Mothusi Magano), Aap (Kenneth Nkosi), and Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe). The gang steals and in general leads a life of dangerous existence, a life that abruptly alters when the gang robs and kills a gentle older man on the subway. They are on the run now and Tsotsi isolates himself further when he brutally beats Boston.  He descends further into the abyss when he steals a car in the wealthy neighborhood, shooting the woman driving, and then discovering that in the back seat is an infant.  His childhood flashes before his eyes and he finally shows a degree if buried decency when he takes the child with him as he abandons the stolen vehicle.  Young and inexperienced in child care (his own childhood was riddled with hate and abuse), he seeks help from a young woman Miriam (Terry Pheto) who has an infant of her own (with no father) and serves as a wet nurse for the child.  The manner in which Tsotsi gradually reconciles his bad life with his nascent response to recognizing kindness and salvation advances the story to its conclusion.There is far more to the story than this short synopsis would indicate: there are levels of probing into the mind of the youthful criminal and the making of a gangster and the interaction among thieves and the changes that situations can alter that are beautifully written by Director Gavin Hood based on the Athol Fugard novel. The script is terse and much is left to the physical expressions of the characters, each acted to perfection by a stunning cast.  The outsider living situation of these people is filmed with tremendous atmosphere and creativity by cinematographer Lance Gewer and the musical score by Paul Hepker and Mark Kilian serves to support the mood and action well.  This is a tough movie to watch because of the reality of the issues: this is a superlative film to experience for the message it offers and for the wholly unforgettable acting of young Presley Chweneyagae and Terry Pheto. In Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans with English subtitles. Highly Recommended.

But if only to keep others from getting, like myself, mislead by the inexplicable 5 star reviews; here's a differing viewpoint.This film, is well photographed, but that's all it has going for it. It has a protagonist I can't remotely relate to, unlike COG where I did relate to that protagonist. I didn't care remotely about Tsotsi. He was a repugnant character, I didn't give a darn about his redemption.It takes a special actor to, in the part of a villain, still elicit interest in the audience. Perhaps with a different lead actor, I would have disliked this film less. Not everyone is lead actor material, can carry a film, and the actor playing Tsotsi, definitely cannot. He annoyed me every second he was on screen.(what's the old joke? some people have a face for radio :) )Murder? Carjacking and shooting a lady? Steal a baby? Use the potential jeopardy of the baby as a plot device for some moron's redemption? That's crossing a few lines too many. And once crossed had no interest in the protagonist.

It is a parabole of this transformation that has to take place in the soul of every single citizen, one after the other, and all in the solitude of meditation and reflection. This happens with Tsotsi on the day when the crying of a baby reminds him of the time when he was brutalized by his own father. This crying meant his past of alienation and victimization could be cauterized and bought back to become a beacon on the road to salvation. Just let your heart speak and do something good to repair the evil you may have done or the evil one may have done to you. The hungry tears of a baby can open up the sky of a soul to reveal all the stars and the moon that are shining up there waiting for you to capture their brilliance and turn it into the energy you need to turn the page, to finally discover the value of love, the love of a baby, your love for the baby, and the deepest ever desire to transform the world by transforming yourself because history is done in the mental melting pot of our individual spiritualities and minds.

I was surprised by the film because it was both extremely gritty and heartwarming at the same time. At the beginning of the film, I was saddened by Tsotsi's lack of normal human emotions. He seemed to not have a heart at all. But after he accidentally kidnaps a woman's child, he begins to develop a heart. To me, this was kind of like a modern day Grinch story. Tsotsi went from being a heartless murderer, to a man who tried to protect a baby and his parents. This film was, at times, very difficult to watch because there was so much hurt. Emotionally and physically, the people in the film seemed to be hurt over and over again. One of the hardest scenes to watch is when Tsotsi is remembering when his father killed his dog. Another reason that this film was somewhat hard to watch was just the gritty feel that it had. One scene in particular bothered me. Tsotsi has the baby in his house and he leaves him with a can of juice. Tsotsi leaves for the day, seemingly forgetting about the baby, and returns to find the baby covered in bugs and sticky juice. I think what holds this film together and makes it worth watching is seeing how Tsotsi is transformed through out the film. By becoming friends with a local mother, Tsotsi is able to see how a baby needs the love and attention of a mother. The possibility that Tsotsi may actually have a heart keeps the audience interested.

But often as not, it plays against type. The police who chase Tsotsi are white and black, with the more compassionate cop played by the white man. Tsotsi's victims are all black -- some poor (even by South African standardss) and some very wealthy, even by Western standards. The stage is set for a crisis of conscience that is extremely personal and is set against -- not within -- the larger story of the aftereffects of South African apartheid.Fabulous performances by Presley Chweneyagae, who plays the haunted title character, and Terry Pheto, who plays the courageous woman Tsotsi forces to care for his charge.

987784,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000FC2FX8,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 3]","`Tsotsi' is one gorgeous and thrilling film. Not only is it a first-rate piece of storytelling, but it also takes the viewer into a world of South African poverty and crime that one might not know existed. Director/writer Gavin Hood offers us a tale of tragic redemption and uncommon poetry in a subculture of the most abject immorality.The actors here were phenomenal and their performances were both realistic and believable.  Natural talented Presley Chweneyagae , as Tsotsi, is not just physically charismatic, but the changes in his voice are gripping in communicating the extreme range of feelings he experiences over the few days the film takes place. This is a road trip through his soul, from flash backs to existential acts from his depths to finding his humanity (and his real name). His relationship with a cruelly accidental foundling infant has no comparison to the dozens of films, usually comedies, made around the world about an irresponsible guy stuck with a kid and how a child can be father to man. While his picaresque physical and psychic journey is almost as theatrical in its coincidences as ""Crash"", the tension is built up as it is unpredictable in each confrontation whether he will react violently or redemptive.Just when I thought his side kicks were indifferent, even they turned out to have complicated stories that were well portrayed, particularly Mothusi Magano as ""Boston"".Terry Pheto as ""Miriam"" is the very essence of a woman who shows artistic talent, strength and nourishment in her role. It is rare to see maternal love so powerfully portrayed onto a film.The music embedded in here is strong and goes perfect with this picture. There were times I would playback a scene so I can rehear the music samples. After watching this film I was able to grab hold of the soundtrack. The tracks were put together by local South African's. The artist who are particularly outstanding are the tracks by local Kwaito artist Zola which uniquely combine local and international hip hop into a new sound, as well as tracks with the inspiring voice of Vasi Mahlasela over choirs, which recalls Ladysmith Black Mambazo. With an attention to detail in the music, the middle class family listens to soft R & B on their car radio, in comparison to the township sound that surrounds the Soweto residents.The subtitles are well done throughout and translated musical lyrics, even as we can occasionally pick out some Pidgin English amidst the township jive. In the end, this crime film is a morality play about sin and love. `Tsotsi' shows a powerful statement about the transforming nature of guilt. This is truly a must see. I also highly recommend 'City of God.'",5,It's amazing what reaches a gang leaders heart.,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,2682,"['Tsotsi', 'one', 'gorgeous', 'thrilling', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'first-rate', 'piece', 'storytelling', 'also', 'viewer', 'world', 'South', 'African', 'poverty', 'crime', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'existed', 'Director/writer', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'tale', 'tragic', 'redemption', 'uncommon', 'poetry', 'subculture', 'most', 'abject', 'immorality.The', 'actors', 'here', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'performances', 'were', 'realistic', 'believable', 'Natural', 'talented', 'Presley', 'Chweneyagae', 'Tsotsi', 'not', 'just', 'physically', 'charismatic', 'changes', 'voice', 'are', 'gripping', 'communicating', 'extreme', 'range', 'feelings', 'few', 'days', 'film', 'place', 'road', 'trip', 'soul', 'flash', 'backs', 'existential', 'acts', 'depths', 'finding', 'humanity', 'real', 'name', 'relationship', 'cruelly', 'accidental', 'foundling', 'infant', 'comparison', 'dozens', 'films', 'usually', 'comedies', 'made', 'world', 'irresponsible', 'guy', 'stuck', 'kid', 'how', 'child', 'can', 'be', 'father', 'man', 'picaresque', 'physical', 'psychic', 'journey', 'almost', 'theatrical', 'coincidences', 'Crash', 'tension', 'built', 'up', 'unpredictable', 'confrontation', 'will', 'react', 'violently', 'redemptive.Just', 'when', 'thought', 'side', 'kicks', 'were', 'indifferent', 'even', 'turned', 'out', 'have', 'complicated', 'stories', 'were', 'well', 'portrayed', 'particularly', 'Mothusi', 'Magano', 'Boston', '.Terry', 'Pheto', 'Miriam', 'very', 'essence', 'woman', 'who', 'artistic', 'talent', 'strength', 'nourishment', 'role', 'rare', 'see', 'maternal', 'love', 'so', 'powerfully', 'portrayed', 'film.The', 'music', 'embedded', 'here', 'strong', 'perfect', 'picture', 'were', 'times', 'would', 'playback', 'scene', 'can', 'rehear', 'music', 'samples', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'grab', 'hold', 'soundtrack', 'tracks', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'local', 'South', 'African', 'artist', 'who', 'are', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'are', 'tracks', 'local', 'Kwaito', 'artist', 'Zola', 'uniquely', 'combine', 'local', 'international', 'hip', 'hop', 'new', 'sound', 'as', 'well', 'tracks', 'inspiring', 'voice', 'Vasi', 'Mahlasela', 'choirs', 'Ladysmith', 'Black', 'Mambazo', 'attention', 'detail', 'music', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'soft', 'R', 'B', 'car', 'radio', 'comparison', 'township', 'sound', 'Soweto', 'residents.The', 'subtitles', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'translated', 'musical', 'lyrics', 'even', 'can', 'occasionally', 'pick', 'out', 'Pidgin', 'English', 'amidst', 'township', 'jive', 'end', 'crime', 'film', 'morality', 'play', 'sin', 'love', 'Tsotsi', 'powerful', 'statement', 'transforming', 'nature', 'guilt', 'truly', 'must', 'see', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', ""'City"", 'God']",Tsotsi

His face and eyes radiate mostly hate and disdain. He is psychically and emotionally detached and removed. Then, one day he steals a luxury car, shoots the woman to whom it belongs and realizes, once he drives the car away, that there is an infant in the back seat.This beautiful, innocent child forces Tsotsi ( really named David) to face the loss of his Mother, the uncaring, drunken non-concern of his father and the deep seated, mostly ignored or glossed , psychically ignored feelings with which he hasn't been able to deal.Director and screenwriter Gavin Hood (adapted from a novel by Athol Fugard) has fashioned a traditionally structured film and peopled it with non-traditional characters and it works because we can all relate to Tsotsi's dilemma. And it doesn't hurt to have Presley Chweneygae as your lead character. The first time we see Tsotsi on screen he looks at the camera with his huge black eyes: eyes that are filled with superiority, despair, disgust and hurt.

Another recent well-deserved Oscar winner (Best foreign language film) I just had to have in my collection; this is a violent and uncompromising look at life in a Soweto township.Presley Cheweneyagae plays the lead, a Johannesburg small-time gangster whose nickname Tsotsi means ""thug"". I read somewhere that Presley was discovered playing Hamlet in a Soweto theatre group. He's a find in a million, as his performance is mesmerising.Tsotsi finds a baby in the back of a car he's just jacked off a suburban black woman as the woman waited for the security gates outside her home to open. He doesn't do the expected and simply dump the baby at the side of the road - surprisingly, he decides to take it home and care for it. He hasn't a clue how to care for a child of course and he turns to a local woman who makes decorative mobiles from glass. She's a nursing mother herself, and - under the threat of death, mind you - Tsotsi gets her to look after the child while he goes back out there to do his thing.It's an interesting study of how complex life is for people who don't have much and while the movie doesn't make excuses or descend into sentimentality at any point, it's engaging to gradually see the heart of the man called Tsotsi - a man who at first glance seemed utterly heartless - emerge for all to see.

987803,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B000FC2FX8,Randy Keehn,"[1, 1]","""Tsotsi"" came onto my radar screen because of its' 2005 Oscar for Best Foreign-Language films.  I have come to appreciate that the five films nominated in that category are often better, overall, than the five films nominated in any other category that year.  ""Tsotsi"" reaffirms that appreciation.  This is a movie that grabs your attention right from the beginning.  We are quickly made aware of just how bad a person this Tsotsi is.  He's so bad, even one of his comrades in crime admonishes him for his lack of decency.  With this brief yet telling portait of evil, the movie is able to quickly grab hold of the essential plot.Tsotsi shoots a woman as part of a car-jacking.  After driving off in the stolen car, he becomes aware that there is a baby in the back seat.  This challenges him to make a decision.  Perhaps that earlier admonition by his partner in crime stirred something inside him.  The decision that Tsotsi makes is somewhat incomplete but it is a step towards humanity.  We see if evolve in a rather morally clumsy manner yet this enables the viewer to be more accepting of the change.  Without any spark of spiritual conversion, the evolution from evil to good requires patience.  We are drawn towards Tsotsi's redemption but many of us retain a focus on the victims; past and present.  The ending is very well done.  We sense that Tsotsi has regained that turning point in his youth that led him down the wrong path.  This time he seems ready to try a different direction.  There is a common sense of redemption as well as justice.What impressed me the most about ""Tsotsi"" is how it said so much in such a short time.  I believe that this film lasts less than 90 minutes yet I did not feel that I was short-changed as a viewer.  The acting is good and the setting is in a world we see little of on the Silver Screen.  This movie reminded me of ""City of God"" but with a happier ending.  I waivered between 4 and 5 ""stars"" in my rating.

Fugard, as a ""secular Christian,"" presents the redemption of a thoroughly dehumanized ""native boy"" - the very archetype apartheid was created to contain - and thereby demonstrates not only the dehumanization that created him, but the path to redemption for all South Africa.  Pretty sweeping stuff, but Fugard pulled it off by not descending into mawkish religious/political tropes. This film retains that edge.  David the tsotsi starts off as the hard-nosed little killer, but cracking first under fellow-thug Boston's goading and then his abduction of the baby, we see the armor peel painfully from his soul, layer by rusty layer.I give it four rather than five stars, however, because the deleted scenes should have been retained.  The final ending left us up in the air as much as David's hands.  In the director's cut edition are included two alternate endings, one where he is shot, and the other where he escapes.  The escape ending is better, but ultimately we're still left hanging.  The execution ending, however, gives closure.  The symbolism of David's blood mingling with the spilled milk, though heavy, is effective: the flow of life in bitter mixture on the ground.

If you have not yet seen the film and intend to, stop reading now.The most intriguing thing about Tsotsi, in retrospect, is trying to figure out what the difference is between a Lifetime Original Movie and an Academy Award-winning (Best Foreign Language Film) flick. It can't be the plot, or the technical aspects of the film. There's no doubt that Presley Chweneyagae is a better actor than the male leads in most Lifetime movies (say Antonio Sabato Jr.), but is that really enough to propel an otherwise dull, predictable movie into the filmic stratosphere?The plot: Tsotsi (Chweneyagae) leads a small gang in a Johannesburg slum. One night, he shoots a young woman in the process of jacking her car. As he's driving away, he finds that her baby is in the backseat. For the next five days, he finds redemption [cue swelling music] as he tries to figure out how to take care of the baby and get him back to his parents unharmed.All the stupid stereotypes are here. Boy becomes bad because his upbringing was terrible. Boy has revelation that suddenly turns him into, if not a model citizen, then someone you'd consider taking home to mother (if half for the shock value). Boy realizes that his life is pointless when faced with baby. All the good old-fashioned hokum that seems genetically engineered to make the viewer feel good, even though it's nothing more than naked emotional manipulation. Even when it looks as if there's a chance for the filmmakers to break out of the Lifetime Original Movie genre with something interesting, they reach for the happy-kitty-bunny-poniness of feelgood pap.Usually, when I see a film like this, I'm at least halfway prepared for it to be emotional claptrap. This one came out of nowhere.

The story is so moving and the acting is superb. I think that because I wasn't familiar with any of the actors, the film was all the more special and delicate. The characters were believable and the story was so touching, so moving and so surprisingly realistic. I plan to watch more films by Gavin Hood because of this film. I personally thought the lead character, Tsotsi to be rather feminine at times. I thought this helped in making his character really reach the masses. He is a character that is both sensitive and fiercely cruel; an odd pairing but a pairing that works. I personally thought the part when Tsotsi drives off with the baby to be a bit much, almost too much for me to handle, but as the story progressed it made the film (obviously) and it made the film gripping `til the end. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film was the music that accompanied it... it was fitting and true to the mood of the different parts of the film. I thought it was rather interesting how the music would be incorporated too, in that sometimes it was jarring and interruptive, but ultimately, it proved to work for the film given that the film was told as a cause and effect sort of way. I would watch this film again and again; I absolutely loved this film. I am a big foreign film fan and this one has taken the cake this year.

The story concerns a young, ruthless, petty gangster in the poor settlement of Soweto on the outskirts of Johannesburg.  Without giving too much away, the movie begins with a senseless and brutal murder and Tsotsi is introduced as a vicious thug without a trace of remorse. But, when he accidentally acquires a baby, a wellspring of memories of a tortured childhood open up for him.The young man playing Tsotsi is not a professional actor, but does a superb job in the role.  Another star of the show is the ghetto of Soweto with its patched- together houses, long lines at communal wells, drugs and drink -- in short a mass of seething humanity.  A redemptive feature of this environment is a young mother Tsotsi meets who is decent, pleasant and will probably slowly make her way out of the worst of ghetto life.  The prospect is not one of unrelieved pessimism.White people play little role in this movie.  A police inspector on the trail of Tsotsi is the only major white character.  Tsotsi and his colleagues prey on their own kind, who appear for the most part to be ""colored"" in the racial parlance of South Africa.  ""Tsotsi"" is beautifully made, with not a wasted moment.

It's very powerful and involves very little dialogue, but relies mostly on good acting and great cinematography.I agree with the one review that said we don't empathize with his victims enough, but I think the Tsotsi's actions toward the end are his penance.  Just the fact that a villain reaches this point of empathy is something and it wasn't done cheaply, it was done over the course of the film and you feel it's legitimate.  Of course it may have felt more so if we had focused further on the mother's suffering, this is a good point well taken.But we are left with a burning question after the movie's conclusion: What punishment should Tsotsi face?

How about the woman who is paralyzed from Tsotsi's gunfire?  or the honest, dignified businessman who is horrifically knifed for the little money in his wallet?  and the aspiring teacher who is brutally beaten and disfigured by Tsotsi?  The film does not dwell on their fates -- just Tsotsi's.While viewers can be struck by the hopeful note of the possibility of this brutal criminal discovering his own humanity, redemption isn't that simple.  The underlying themes are troubling: it isn't his fault -- his childhood, abusive father, victimized mother, lack of education, etc. may have helped create this monster -- but he IS a monster.  One can be seduced into a feel-good experience by focusing on his emerging empathy and personal growth, but only because the film ignores his victims and the ongoing impact of Tsotsi's actions.If you want a feel-good, hopeful movie -- it's very good.

Every day, Tsotsi's three pals show up on his doorstep, looking for some direction, some meaning. One of their ""jobs"" takes them to a large subway station where Tsotsi spies a businessman paying a vendor with cash from his pay envelope. They follow the mark onto a train and the robbery does not go as planned. This is the first incident which will cause the small time thug to begin reevaluating his life. Later, he travels, alone, to an affluent suburb of Johannesburg and waits for someone to come home. As the rain pours down, he spots a BMW drive into a driveway. The female driver runs out of the car, into the rain, trying to get her husband to open the malfunctioning gate. Tsotsi rushes up and car jacks the vehicle, leaving the screaming woman behind. He soon discovers the reason for her frantic pleas.""Tsotsi"", written and directed by Gavin Hood, and based on a novel by Athol Fugard, is a very good film, and a worthy entry by South Africa in this year's race for Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards.The film is about Tsotsi, the changes he makes in his life and the reasons for these changes. He starts off as an amoral, violent thug who doesn't think twice about killing someone for a couple of dollars. He leads his ragtag group of followers, people who are even more desperate than he is, and who are willing to follow him into any situation. Clearly, this makes Tsotsi feel important and he rules them with a scornful frown, the threat of violence always near.Even though he thinks nothing of killing someone for a few dollars, it is the murder of the businessman which is the turning point. Tsotsi begins to feel maybe there is something wrong here, with him, with his world, with everything. As this change happens, he still acts out, threatening people, harming them, even as he seeks their help or guidance. More telling, these people help him, recognizing the troubled person deep beneath the tough guy surface. At one point, he seeks the help of a single mother, who provides what he wants, but he still finds it necessary to have his gun ready, and waiting. As the story progresses, these feelings of conflict grow and grow, becoming more consuming within him, confusing him even more. Soon, he has to decide which way to go. Will he continue as a criminal or make some effort at reform?Writer/ Director Gavin Hood manages this process well. At no point do we ever feel Tsotsi will ever be a normal human being, but there are definitely shades of progress throughout. As people offer unlikely guidance and help, he seems to soften a bit here and there, but being a tough guy is all he has ever known. It may be all he ever can be and he desperately clings to his tough guy persona. The film shows us this in a believable way. If he simply became an angel, we wouldn't believe in his transformation, or care about the outcome of his situation. The change is gradual, painful and believable.Because the transformation is gradual, and still stained by his violent upbringing, we care about his fate. Chweneyagae leads an impressive cast of unknowns (at least in this country) who bring these characters to life. He convincingly portrays Tsotsi's menace and foreboding attitude. He doesn't speak a lot, but his facial expressions display a lot of menace; he merely stares at someone and they shrink back, afraid of the repercussions. At one point, he brutally beats a member of his gang and we suddenly have evidence of what he is capable of.Most of this film seems drained of theatricality, giving us the impression we are watching a documentary. The one moment that rings slightly false is when Tsotsi takes his gang back to the home of the car jacking victim. They rob the house, holding her husband hostage. Two of the gang members are not quite as believable and appear too cartoonish as they threaten the poor man. This scene seems clearly influenced by American action films and doesn't mesh completely with the rest of the film.The final scene is very memorable and very moving. You'll have to watch the film to actually find out why. I can't spoil it for you. This is one of those films that are difficult to review. If I talk too much, I'll ruin the impact and give away things that you should experience in the theater.""Tsotsi"" is a very good film, worthy of Academy Award consideration.

Tsotsi is presented with depth.  I couldn't take my eyes off of Presley Chweneyagae's very expressive face.I also enjoyed the music (rap/traditional) and the other character actors.

He is so tough that his nickname is Tsotsi (""thug"") One day, he shoots a woman (this does not kill the woman, but she is hospitalized) and robs her car only to discover a baby in the backseat. Tsotsi somewhat impulsively takes the child and returns to his poor township. He begins to try and care for the baby and in doing so begins to slowly re prioritize what is important in his life. He is helped in raising the child by a local widowed mother and he begins to fall out with his gangster friends. The movie keeps the sentimentality in check and reminds the viewer of Tsotsi's desperate circumstances (especially in one scene where he robs the house of the family whose baby he has stolen). It is ultimately a good drama, told with a personal style. The soundtrack is South African hip hop from Zola which works well with the setting of the story.

987816,A3ADK3ZTJ87915,B000FC2FX8,"Zinta Aistars ""Writer & Editor""","[0, 0]","Yes, I knew I was having my heart tugged, occasionally rather forcefully. Tsotsi, with a powerful performance by Presley Chweneyagae in the lead role, is a story about a young man who has become tougher than nails, and just as piercing in his hardened cruelty, and how within six days he finds some still tender places in his buried-deep heart.There are no surprise twists in this plot, but I don't need surprises to enjoy a movie. I'm not even sure I bought into how the story played out. Could happen. Might not. It would probably be easier for me to imagine such a hardened young gangster tossing an infant into the ditch without a second thought. And still, I was willing to suspend my disbelief, perhaps also my own hardened cynicism, and follow the fascinating process of Tsotsi's peeling open heart.After a spattering of brutal behavior to establish his deviancy - we see Tsotsi beat a friend to a bloody pulp, taunt a crippled man, steal a car, shoot a woman in the gut - he inadvertantly ends up kidnapping an infant boy along with a joy ride. There is a moment of indecision. Abandon the baby with the car? He almost walks away, doubles back, and tosses the baby in a shopping bag, taking him home. What follows are six days of gradual transformation. Diapering in newspaper is wincingly convincing. Needing sustenance for the child, he ends up holding a gun to a nursing young mother, forcing her to nurse his ""adopted"" child. When she asks the child's name, he thinks, then gives her the name by which he was known as a small boy: David. It is in this moment that the parallel is set. The baby becomes that damaged inner child that is Tsotsi, almost as if giving him a second chance to spend time with his own mother, to redeem a childhood that, as we see in various quick flashbacks, was near unbearably cruel at the hands of a sociopathic father.I won't argue the predictability of the finish. I give the movie a prize, or perhaps more accurately to Presley Chweneyagae, for the sheer vulnerability and nakedness of his face and gestures so exposed in the last scene. He wordlessly expresses all that is the effect of abuse in one single moment on the screen. To be so vulnerable and exposed is the greatest courage of all.
