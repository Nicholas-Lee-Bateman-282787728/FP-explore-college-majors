1163571,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B0019K4YSO,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","So I bought this DVD 4-pack of vampire movies. I only paid $5 for it. And after watching the third movie on the set, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA'S GUEST, it's safe to say I was robbed.Since I've never read the Stoker story from which the film's title was taken, I can't say how closely the movie follows the original plot, but for Stoker's sake, I hope it's not very close, because this movie was BOOOOOORRRR-RRRRRRRINGGGGG!!!The movie concerns a young Bram Stoker (Wes Ramsey, ""CSI: Miami""), in love with a young Elizabeth Murray (Kelsey McCann, ""The O.C.""), much to the chagrin of Elizabeth's father, Admiral Murray. The Admiral forbids the Irishman from seeing his daughter for one year. Stoker agrees and goes off to a meeting with Count Dracula about a castle the Count wishes to purchase. Afterward, Stoker retreats to a country inn where I assume he's going to spend the next year. Meanwhile, Elizabeth, in tears, decides to flee home on a train and be with her love. She's met at the train station by Count Dracula who offers her a ride in his carriage. She unloads on him the mountain of woe she's living with and the Count consoles her like a gentleman. Then he puts her to sleep with his vampire powers and when she wakes up she finds herself in Transylvania, at the Count's castle.The Count tells her of a long-standing feud between the Murrays and the Draculas and how he's kidnapped her in hopes of bringing the Admiral to him so they can settle the score once and for all. Oh, and he's also going to impregnate her. Personally, I'm not sure the Count understands the definition of the word ""guest"".Word reaches Bram and he takes off immediately for Transylvania. The Admiral, as well, is on his way, and when the two get there, a climactic battle ensues between the old enemies, while Bram is charged with keeping the Admiral's little girl safe.You know, it took me about 5 minutes to lay down that plot, but it took the movie 86 minutes to show it. And that was definitely about 60 minutes too long. Much of the movie was taken up with people walking or Count Dracula taking a dramatic pause between the clauses of each sentence. This movie was definitely not built for speed.The meandering pace was the least of the problems here, though. Let's start with the acting. For whatever reason, writer/director Michael Feifer (BOSTON STRANGLER: THE UNTOLD STORY) has cast Andrew Bryniarski as the Count and anyone who's seen the two recent TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE movies (Bryniarski starred as Thomas Hewitt/Leatherface in the 2003 and 2006 movies), knows that dude is not small. 6 foot 3, this bodybuilder doesn't have the grace to pull off king of the Vampires. And Feifer really should have told him to stop waving his fingers in the air, we saw the pointed fingernails, yes, so stop trying to be fancy. He was like a kid with a new toy, showing those things off.The Count's Transylvanian castle was very obviously filmed inside a business after hours or while they were closed on the weekend. I kept thinking it looked like a bank or a college, maybe even a mausoleum, and I was right. A mausoleum was thanked in the credits. The inability to suspend my disbelief and convince myself they really were inside an ancient castle in the 1800s ruined every scene that took place there.Also let's talk about the vampire himself. Other than the Count--yes, he was killed in the end, because isn't he always?--there was exactly one death in this movie, and that was by hanging, not by being drained of all blood by Count Dracula. Oh, Dracula killed the fellow, but he caused him to be magically lifted off the ground and carried toward a noose where he was hanged until death. So, really, any tension possibly caused by having this hulking brute of a vampire stalking you is completely undercut by not having him do any actual vampiric killing AT ALL throughout the entire movie. It's a vampire, movie;I expected at least ONE fangs-in-the-neck death.The acting on the part of the rest of the cast was just as bad as Bryniarski's. Kelsey McCann looks wholly confused and unsure through the entire movie while Wes Ramsey, from Kentucky, struggles mightily with his Irish accent. For the longest time, I didn't even realize he was doing an accent. I started off thinking ""Wasn't Stoker Irish?"" Then when he was referred to later in the movie as an Irishman, well I just felt bad for Ramsey.At the end of this movie, I'm left feeling not really sure what to think. The tone was deadly serious, but everything about it was just so bad I can't believe the movie was meant as anything but a deadpan spoof of an actual Dracula movie. I want to think their intentions were good, but come on!I admit I'm not very neighborly to begin with, but this is one guest that is most definitely and absolutely NOT welcome here.",1,Bram Stoker's

Williams ""gareth37""","[1, 1]","They should have gone back to the editing room and picked up the film cuts on the floor and inserted them into the final version.  Perhaps, it would have made it a decent film on the subject of Dracula.As it is, this film is conjoined with gaps in the storyline.  Elizabeth's conversational style is so laden with Victorian colloquialism that you feel sorry for her to have to recite this script.  Definitely, as Elizabeth softly stated, she was ""broken"".Count Dracula was as menacing and sinister as a goldfish.  Forget about any European sex appeal.  It isn't there.  Andrew Bryniarski,the actor, had a few brief moments,but he had little to work with on this script.  Probably, the worst Dracula presentation that I have seen in film, and I have seen a great number of Dracula type films in my life.Michael Feifer wrote and this directed this film.  He has an impressive resume, and he did a cameo as Admiral Murray's driver.  However, Mr. Feifer's resume could have survived without this inclusion.A nice touch was to cast Bram Stoker,the author of Dracula,as the lead character and romantic interest for Elizabeth.  Unfortunately, Elizabeth Murray was a bit too liberalized for the Victorian era, and the match did not seem to be made in heaven, especially with her bloodline and special destiny which her father aptly reminded her.The motif of star crossed lovers facing separation and tragedy is a noble concept which the film explored in a very limited fashion. Perhaps, this is where the fault is -the story never undocked from its moorings.

1163573,A1KKC3UZO4FMNL,B0019K4YSO,"Herbert Booker ""Herbert Booker""","[0, 1]","""GREETINGS & SALUTATIONS!"" The book titled: Bram Stoker's Dracula's Guest was really made into a film almost to the letter. It would also be a good idea to read the book because so much action takes place, it will make it easier to comprehend some of the scenes like the ""rat people"" living in the garbage-dumps of the outskirts of 18th and 19th century France. The scene of the ""Rat People,"" is not unlike Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and Mrs. Lovett who used the human flesh of Todd's victims in her meat pies. We are not told directly that they intended to not only rob the young man, Bram Stoker's character, they planned to eat him as they also cannibals.  The charcater of Dracula was bigger and stronger than others who played that role as he had centuries of experience as a survivor.  This motion picture is definately a cut about other ""Vampyre"" movies and equal to ""Nosferatu"" of 1921, and ""Dracula"" of 1931. Bela Lugosi and Max Schreck would be proud of Andrew Bryniarski who played Dracula in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula's Guest.""

The other reviewers have done a fair job at explaining why this movie is bad (LOW budget effects, didn't follow the original story much at all, etc). But what really puzzles me is why they hired Andrew Bryniarski to play Dracula. Up until now, most of us horror-philes agreed that the chubbiest vampire on record was Lon Chaney Jr's ""Son of Dracula"" (which I liked in spite of Chaney's being a well fed vamp). Bryniarski has about 100 pounds on Chaney. Tall? Gaunt? Corpselike? No way- this Drac's been to the ""all you can eat"" buffet. Now I gave it two stars because I did like the period costumes.

Filmed entirely in and around Los Angeles, ""Dracula's Guest"" has the dramatic impact of a 1950's television commercial and all the thrills of watching paint dry.  While Wes Ramsey is quite good as Bram Stoker and does not overdo the Irish accent, his love interest, Elizabeth, played by Kelsey McCann, mangles the British accent with nasal American vowels.  Some of the supporting players are quite good, other terrible, but even the best performances can't lift this tedious, cheaply made exploitation movie from the mire of its miserable script and equally miserable direction.

1163578,A8FVQNOFHLMK8,B0019K4YSO,"M.R. Loisel ""&#34;Six&#34;""","[1, 2]","I give this movie one star for Wes Ramsey (Bram Stoker) who I kept wishing, as he was running across Europe, would run into a better movie. He was the one bright spot in the whole thing. There was only one segment out of Stoker's short story, and that was Bram being chased by the dog (a Rottweiler) which should have been a wolf(couldn't they even get a German Shepherd to be a fake wolf?) and then rescued. Andrew Bryniarski was one of the most unappealing Draculas I've ever seen. To the writer's credit, they did try to insert a bit from Stoker's book for Dracula to say, his speech where he's talking about himself: ""we have a right to be proud...the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland, etc."", but it was so garbled you could hardly understand what he was saying. He practically threw that speech away, he rushed through it so quickly.  And to be a bit picky-when was this movie set? Costumes were from the 1850s-90s. Women's hair was all wrong, they NEVER wore it loose during these years. And the French people in the cabin talked about the Bastille and the Revolution. Just how old were these people if it was even set in 1850? I agree with another reviewer about the Count's castle being a mausoleum?? uh-huh. Also, Dracula scorned Stoker's use of mortal weapons but later didn't seem to mind picking up a sword to fight Admiral Murray.  And for the record, Bram Stoker's wife's name was Florence. If you don't know anything about Stoker or Dracula, the book or short story and just want to watch a vampire flick, you might not mind it. However, if you do, this movie is just irritating because it could have been SO much better, so just skip it.",1,One of the worst,1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,1655,"['give', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'Wes', 'Ramsey', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'who', 'kept', 'wishing', 'was', 'running', 'Europe', 'would', 'run', 'better', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'bright', 'spot', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'segment', 'Stoker', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'Bram', 'being', 'chased', 'dog', 'Rottweiler', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wolf', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'be', 'fake', 'wolf', 'then', 'rescued', 'Andrew', 'Bryniarski', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'unappealing', 'Draculas', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'writer', 'credit', 'did', 'try', 'insert', 'bit', 'Stoker', 'book', 'Dracula', 'say', 'speech', 'where', 'talking', 'have', 'right', 'be', 'proud', 'Ugric', 'tribe', 'bore', 'down', 'Iceland', 'etc', 'was', 'so', 'garbled', 'could', 'hardly', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'practically', 'threw', 'speech', 'away', 'rushed', 'so', 'quickly', 'be', 'bit', 'picky-when', 'was', 'movie', 'set', 'Costumes', 'were', '1850s-90s', 'Women', 'hair', 'was', 'wrong', 'NEVER', 'wore', 'loose', 'years', 'French', 'people', 'cabin', 'talked', 'Bastille', 'Revolution', 'Just', 'how', 'old', 'were', 'people', 'was', 'even', 'set', '1850', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Count', 'castle', 'being', 'mausoleum', 'uh-huh', 'Also', 'Dracula', 'scorned', 'Stoker', 'use', 'mortal', 'weapons', 'later', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'picking', 'up', 'sword', 'fight', 'Admiral', 'Murray', 'record', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'wife', 'name', 'was', 'Florence', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'book', 'short', 'story', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'vampire', 'flick', 'might', 'not', 'mind', 'However', 'do', 'movie', 'just', 'irritating', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'so', 'just', 'skip']",Bram Stokers Draculas Guest
1163579,A1H6GR50RF4EYM,B0019K4YSO,"W. Routson ""The Flmfreek""","[2, 4]","This is without a doubt the most boring version of the Dracula legend I've ever seen Andrew Bryniarski is the worst actor to date to play the legendary blood sucker his on screen persona makes Dracula look more like a supernatural date rapist than the prince of darkness the whole story tells parts of the original tale completely out of sequence and adds parts that clearly don't belong. The pace of the movie is horrible I found myself falling asleep and having to back up to the last part I had seen on at least three occasions the director did a terrible job the movie looks like it was filmed with video equiptment and looks bad oddly some of the sets looked good but I seriously doubt that Dracula lived in a mausoleum every film I've seen has clearly shown the castle to be in ruins for the most part as you would expect since it's owner was dead and had not been lived in let alone kept all spiffy clean.The phoney accents used by the actors are annoying and the over use of voice overs would make Morgan Freeman run out screeming in the night.And whats up with those people in the cabin and the freaks looking in the window all in all this movie makes no sence.It makes you wonder who would release such a piece of junk untill you remember seeing the Lions Gate logo at the beginning of the flick, Lions Gate just doesn't care what they release they're killing the genre one movie at a time sure every now and then they release a good one but they release more garbage than a chinese  resteraunt.Don't buy it, Don't rent it if you have to see it wait for it to be showed on the Sci-Fi channel although it might be too crappy even for them.",1,A waste of film,1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,1648,"['doubt', 'most', 'boring', 'version', 'Dracula', 'legend', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Andrew', 'Bryniarski', 'worst', 'actor', 'date', 'play', 'legendary', 'blood', 'sucker', 'screen', 'persona', 'Dracula', 'look', 'more', 'supernatural', 'date', 'rapist', 'prince', 'darkness', 'whole', 'story', 'tells', 'parts', 'original', 'tale', 'completely', 'sequence', 'parts', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'pace', 'movie', 'horrible', 'found', 'falling', 'asleep', 'having', 'back', 'up', 'last', 'part', 'had', 'seen', 'least', 'three', 'occasions', 'director', 'did', 'terrible', 'job', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'video', 'equiptment', 'bad', 'oddly', 'sets', 'looked', 'good', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'Dracula', 'lived', 'mausoleum', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'clearly', 'shown', 'castle', 'be', 'ruins', 'most', 'part', 'would', 'expect', 'owner', 'was', 'dead', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'lived', 'let', 'alone', 'kept', 'spiffy', 'clean.The', 'phoney', 'accents', 'used', 'actors', 'are', 'annoying', 'over', 'use', 'voice', 'overs', 'would', 'make', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'run', 'out', 'screeming', 'night.And', 'up', 'people', 'cabin', 'freaks', 'looking', 'window', 'movie', 'sence.It', 'wonder', 'who', 'would', 'release', 'such', 'piece', 'junk', 'untill', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'logo', 'beginning', 'flick', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'just', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'release', ""'re"", 'killing', 'genre', 'one', 'movie', 'time', 'sure', 'now', 'then', 'release', 'good', 'one', 'release', 'more', 'garbage', 'chinese', 'resteraunt.Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'have', 'see', 'wait', 'be', 'showed', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'crappy', 'even']",Bram Stokers Draculas Guest
