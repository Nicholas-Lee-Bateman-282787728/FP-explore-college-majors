It is not vigorous enough to be a truly challenging power yoga workout (for such a practice, please try Bryan Kest's Power Yoga 3 ""Sweat"" or Baron Baptiste's Journey Into Power 3), it is not fluid enough to be considered hatha yoga (for such a practice, please try anything by Shiva Rea or the excellent Yoga Mind and Body featuring Ali McGraw and Erich Schiffman), and it is not contemplative enough to be considered a meditation practice (for such a practice please try Power Yoga with Rodney Yee, Yoga for Strength and Energy by Gaiam or Candlelight Yoga with Sara Ivanhoe).  What you wind up with is a sort of ""hip yoga"" featuring all of the athletic elements of yoga, but nothing really instructive about the practice itself.In order to really practice yoga, you must engage your bandas and practice ujjayi breathing technique.  If you are not doing those things, then you are simply performing intense stretches and simple gymnastics.  There is nothing wrong with intense stretching and simple gymnastics per se, it just is not yoga.I generally use my yoga practice as a form of meditation.  Consequently, I found the soundtrack jarring and terribly distracting.It is a decent DVD, but I do not recommend it overall since there are better ones out there, especially for the home based practitioner.",3,"OK yoga, maddening music",1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,1340,"['yoga', 'DVD', 'merely', 'OK', 'not', 'vigorous', 'enough', 'be', 'truly', 'challenging', 'power', 'yoga', 'workout', 'practice', 'please', 'try', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'Power', 'Yoga', '3', 'Sweat', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Power', '3', 'not', 'fluid', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'hatha', 'yoga', 'practice', 'please', 'try', 'anything', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'excellent', 'Yoga', 'Mind', 'Body', 'featuring', 'Ali', 'McGraw', 'Erich', 'Schiffman', 'not', 'contemplative', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'meditation', 'practice', 'practice', 'please', 'try', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Yoga', 'Strength', 'Energy', 'Gaiam', 'Candlelight', 'Yoga', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'What', 'wind', 'up', 'sort', 'hip', 'yoga', 'featuring', 'athletic', 'elements', 'yoga', 'nothing', 'really', 'instructive', 'practice', 'itself.In', 'order', 'really', 'practice', 'yoga', 'must', 'engage', 'bandas', 'practice', 'ujjayi', 'breathing', 'technique', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'things', 'then', 'are', 'simply', 'performing', 'intense', 'stretches', 'simple', 'gymnastics', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'intense', 'stretching', 'simple', 'gymnastics', 'se', 'just', 'not', 'yoga.I', 'generally', 'use', 'yoga', 'practice', 'form', 'meditation', 'Consequently', 'found', 'soundtrack', 'jarring', 'terribly', 'distracting.It', 'decent', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'overall', 'are', 'better', 'ones', 'there', 'especially', 'home', 'based', 'practitioner']",MTV Yoga

Instructor Kristin McGee teaches Vinyasa style, which is a flowing, dance-like style rather than slow poses.  Some of the poses were difficult, especially the balancing ones, but they can be easily modified with blocks or a yoga strap.  I especially liked the constant breath coaching, since like a lot of people I tend to hold my breath while exercising.  The music wasn't that great, in fact I found it distracting, so I liked the ""instructor-only"" audio track.  McGee is a wonderfully no-nonsense coach and doesn't waste time with ""feel the energy from the earth/you are one with the universe"" statements.

Now I realize that this is titled MTV &quot;yoga&quot; and not MTV &quot;power yoga&quot;, but I wanted to clarify for others who might consider purchasing this based on reviews saying that this is a difficult workout.

Not your typical yoga exercise!it features the vinyasa flowing style of yoga where one pose flows into another.  Hosted by Lori (from RW- back to new york) who is the beginner and shows easier modifications to the poses.  there is another woman and a guy who show intermediate and advanced poses--this is great so that this workout can continue to evolve with your experience level and flexibility.the instructor, kristin, is quite good- she is not obtrusive or annoying and is a very good ""breath"" coach.  she reminds you to breath in/out at the appropriate times and does each pose with 1 breath intervals which makes the yoga flow and seem faster paced.  I definately thought this made it more cardio than most yoga tapes.the workout begins with little warmup and then goes into the typical yoga poses**sun salutations**standing poses (triangle/warrior 1/2/side angle pose)**floor work (pigeon pose/child's pose/prayer)**balance (tree/standing y or warrior 3)**cool downAfter the workout, lori (the beginner) asks questions about the more difficult poses (downward dog, chatarunga etc).

717782,A15TIAG5RDIGGY,B00006JDTH,Elizabeth M,"[3, 5]","Ok, I heard MTV and Yoga in the same sentence and I thought ""oxymoron"". I really had the lowest of low expectations, assuming that the poses would be wrongly named, poorly executed, etc. I thought the use of Lori Trespicio from The Real World NYC as a ""host"" would be eye-roll worthy. The promise of background music from a great DJ (he did the soundtrack for the movie ""Go"") actually was off-putting in this setting.I was surprised on all counts. I've been a student of yoga for years and the poses were named correctly and executed properly, the instruction was clear and easy to follow. Lori was really in the background and didn't speak throughout the whole thing (she was just used as an example of a beginner) so her presence was absolutely unnecessary and a weird selling point. The instructor, Kristin, turned me off at first. Her claim that the DVD wouldn't be like the yoga most people think of with it's ""hokey new age music"" put the fear into me (I like the music most of my yoga studios play). However, I actually found the soundtrack pleasantly inconspicuous (and loved that it can be turned off so all you hear is the instructor- I can put on my own background music, a nice touch.) The poses were all familiar, and I liked Kristin's elaboration of important points. Honestly, Kristin was as good as some yoga instructors I have had. I definitely warmed to her presence.Be forewarned that you need a yoga mat before beginning this. I also think savasana(final relaxation) needs to be longer, so you might consider lowering the lights and pausing/stopping the video when it gets to this point (and If you have one, a nice eve bag doesn't hurt!)Don't be afraid to modify the poses if even the ""simpler"" versions feel difficult.",5,Another yoga veteran who loves this!,1086652800,"06 8, 2004",2004,1740,"['Ok', 'heard', 'MTV', 'Yoga', 'same', 'sentence', 'thought', 'oxymoron', 'really', 'had', 'lowest', 'low', 'expectations', 'assuming', 'poses', 'would', 'be', 'wrongly', 'named', 'poorly', 'executed', 'etc', 'thought', 'use', 'Lori', 'Trespicio', 'Real', 'World', 'NYC', 'host', 'would', 'be', 'eye-roll', 'worthy', 'promise', 'background', 'music', 'great', 'DJ', 'did', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'Go', 'actually', 'was', 'off-putting', 'setting.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'counts', ""'ve"", 'been', 'student', 'yoga', 'years', 'poses', 'were', 'named', 'correctly', 'executed', 'properly', 'instruction', 'was', 'clear', 'easy', 'follow', 'Lori', 'was', 'really', 'background', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'just', 'used', 'example', 'beginner', 'presence', 'was', 'absolutely', 'unnecessary', 'weird', 'selling', 'point', 'instructor', 'Kristin', 'turned', 'off', 'first', 'claim', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'yoga', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'hokey', 'new', 'age', 'music', 'put', 'fear', 'like', 'music', 'most', 'yoga', 'studios', 'play', 'However', 'actually', 'found', 'soundtrack', 'pleasantly', 'inconspicuous', 'loved', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'all', 'hear', 'instructor-', 'can', 'put', 'own', 'background', 'music', 'nice', 'touch', 'poses', 'were', 'familiar', 'liked', 'Kristin', 'elaboration', 'important', 'points', 'Honestly', 'Kristin', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'yoga', 'instructors', 'have', 'had', 'definitely', 'warmed', 'presence.Be', 'forewarned', 'need', 'yoga', 'mat', 'beginning', 'also', 'think', 'savasana', 'final', 'relaxation', 'be', 'longer', 'might', 'consider', 'lowering', 'lights', 'pausing/stopping', 'video', 'when', 'point', 'have', 'one', 'nice', 'eve', 'bag', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'modify', 'poses', 'even', 'simpler', 'versions', 'feel', 'difficult']",MTV Yoga

The background exercisers do not always demonstrate good form so please watch Kristin and don't even try and jump in and out of the poses unless you know you can. The camera work isn't good enough for a workout video let alone yoga so Kristin's good cueing is doubly valuable. The music sounds like muzak to me but each to his or her own and it's easy to switch it off. The nightclub setting is a drawback because it really is too dark. It almost looks like a pub!

Not necessarily an easy routine either but not frenetic.  I don't mind instructors talking and I don't find this instructor annoying, but the music is downright jarring and the pace is much too fast.  As a beginner, I do not jump back into downward dog from forward standing bend.  Rather I step back.

717793,A127IROWZNM255,B00006JDTH,Rebecca E. Ratliff,"[3, 4]","I love love love this DVD!  For a while, I had been wanting to try yoga, but wasn't really sure where to start.  I saw this, and decided to buy it just because I wouldn't really lose anything.  (NOTE:  I was a complete beginner when I started this DVD.  All I'd known of yoga was perhaps, looking at the poses in magazine articles, etc.)  Definitely not a disappointing buy.  This gives a pleasant yoga workout using mostly basic moves, and a few more advanced ones.  It has nice music going throughout it, which is good considering it's made by MTV, but it also has the feature on the DVD to turn the music off, which is nice if you're one who doesn't like the style featured.  The instructor, Kristin Mcgee, is very personable and she makes sure to explain all the moves well, and also reminds the viewer to keep breathing throughout.  This can be used by inexperienced people as well as those who are more advanced.  They show how to do the move the regular way, then they have a way to do it for beginners, and then for more advanced.  This is a very good idea.  I've seen good results from doing this workout regularly, but a nice thing about it is you don't think you're really working out until the next day when you're sore.  I don't understand why a lot of the reviews say that the pace is too fast/difficult/only for advanced.  As I stated before, I was a complete beginner as far as yoga was concerned.  However, I was moderately fit and quite flexible due to dancing, so maybe that is why I found it gave me exactly the type of workout I was looking for.  Never had trouble keeping up, and this is without knowing the moves beforehand.  I think this is because McGee does a very good job of explaining all of the moves.  If you're interested in trying yoga, and want great music to go along with it, I definitely recommend this.",5,Great yoga workout.,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,1840,"['love', 'love', 'love', 'DVD', 'while', 'had', 'been', 'wanting', 'try', 'yoga', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'where', 'start', 'saw', 'decided', 'buy', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'lose', 'anything', 'NOTE', 'was', 'complete', 'beginner', 'when', 'started', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'known', 'yoga', 'was', 'perhaps', 'looking', 'poses', 'magazine', 'articles', 'etc', 'Definitely', 'not', 'disappointing', 'buy', 'pleasant', 'yoga', 'using', 'mostly', 'basic', 'moves', 'few', 'more', 'advanced', 'ones', 'nice', 'music', 'going', 'good', 'considering', 'made', 'MTV', 'also', 'feature', 'DVD', 'turn', 'music', 'nice', ""'re"", 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'style', 'featured', 'instructor', 'Kristin', 'Mcgee', 'very', 'personable', 'sure', 'explain', 'moves', 'well', 'also', 'viewer', 'keep', 'breathing', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'inexperienced', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'advanced', 'show', 'how', 'do', 'move', 'regular', 'way', 'then', 'have', 'way', 'do', 'beginners', 'then', 'more', 'advanced', 'very', 'good', 'idea', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'results', 'doing', 'workout', 'regularly', 'nice', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'re"", 'really', 'working', 'out', 'next', 'day', 'when', ""'re"", 'sore', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'lot', 'reviews', 'say', 'pace', 'too', 'fast/difficult/only', 'advanced', 'stated', 'was', 'complete', 'beginner', 'as', 'far', 'yoga', 'was', 'concerned', 'However', 'was', 'moderately', 'fit', 'quite', 'flexible', 'due', 'dancing', 'so', 'maybe', 'why', 'found', 'gave', 'exactly', 'type', 'workout', 'was', 'looking', 'Never', 'had', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'up', 'knowing', 'moves', 'beforehand', 'think', 'McGee', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'moves', ""'re"", 'interested', 'trying', 'yoga', 'want', 'great', 'music', 'go', 'along', 'definitely', 'recommend']",MTV Yoga
717794,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00006JDTH,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[23, 24]","It is rare to find a workout in which you enjoy all the exercises. This is one of those exceptional routines that combines a sensuous flow of movement, motivational music and invigorating routines.The setting is striking and the music will be loved by anyone who enjoys the ""Pure Moods"" CDs. What you will completely love is the ability to use your own music. There is an ""Alternative Audio Track"" containing absolutely no music! That is a real bonus in the Special Features section.If you have a CD player or stereo in the same room, you can play any motivational music you prefer and if you want to play relaxing music with candles, you can adapt the workout to suit your more relaxed mood.They have also included:Position Breakdowns - pictures and explanationsInstructor BiographiesThis is actually a medium to fast paced workout in places and then at times it slows to a complete standstill as you relax into the poses. This is the ""vinyasa"" or flow of poses style.Frankly, it is perfect. If you are a beginner, you have time to catch up while advanced and intermediate students are already in the ""standstill"" stage. I loved the way this routine can be adapted for all levels of yoga practice.While I've done yoga for a few years on and off, this has to be not only the most invigorating routine, but also the most enjoyable. My entire body felt warm within a few minutes and at the end I was convinced I had really received an excellent workout. My arms, legs and stomach could feel they had been put through the motions, yet I felt completely relaxed and in a good frame of mind as the routine wound down to a completely relaxed pace.Kristin McGee is an excellent instructor and her queuing is perfect if not the best I've ever heard. She knows how to translate her knowledge to the students all while giving the names of the poses and emphasizing breathing.You literally fall under her spell and do exactly what she tells you to do. There is no resistance. I was impressed with her creativity and especially enjoyed the unique hip stretches that felt so good. She explains the difference between the lunge and warrior poses and gives tips throughout the workout. You feel nurtured throughout your practice.Poses you will learn:Downward Facing DogChaturanga - the most difficult yoga move I've tried, but they have variations.Warrior OneWarrior TwoWarrior ThreeExtended Side AngleTwisted LungeUpward Facing DogTriangleBoat PoseTree PoseBaby CobraLocustAnd more...The routine opens with breathing and this is emphasized throughout the entire workout. You will know when to breathe in and out and soon you will realize that in fact, once you get past the first 10 minutes, your breathing will become naturally more rapid in pace. You then will be doing standing postures, back bends, forward bends and all the poses listed above. The balancing poses were perhaps some of the most challenging moves and you might want to stand near a wall when first attempting those particular exercises.This workout is perfect for beginning, intermediate and advanced students. You will need a yoga mat and a block. These are items you can find almost in any store these days or are easily found online.I strongly advise purchasing the DVD for the special features! Since the DVD offers an alternative audio track, this is appropriate for all ages and you can do the routine without any music if you prefer a more ascetic or worshipful approach. The alternative audio track is perhaps the most exciting part of this DVD besides the excellent instruction.Highly recommended! 10 Stars.

The music is cool, but it more energizes you, hurries you along if you have limited time before you have to be somewhere which is not relaxing or calming. She even does a fast power yoga pace of warrior 1, 2 & sun salutations 3x.Kristin has great form & body awareness & there's a hint of her true respect for the spiritual/body awareness of yoga, but this dvd is geared to more a workout/pilates/fitness session then spiritual. If you're looking for a mind/body connection, you won't find it here. She tells you when to breathe, but she seems to race through as if she was told to get it done as fast as possible w/o it being a power yoga dvd.The moves felt great, but only because I've been doing yoga for 5 years could I still enjoy the moves & be aware of my own body & work with it instead of it just being a workout calorie burner, not enjoying the mind/body connection I get from Rodney Yee, Shiva Rea, Wai Lana, Seane Corn, Rainbeau Mars, Teigh McDonough. Yoga for Sex & The Firm's Power yoga even had more body awareness.This is NOT for newbies or beginners because of the lack of time for true instruction to avoid injury.
