The problem is that there isn&#8217;t anything really special here, and the film doesn&#8217;t try to do anything but repeat the tried and true formula of giving the teacher a backbone and heart that others didn&#8217;t have and so the film winds up feeling very generic.  Yes, it is based on actual events, but so are the countless other films following this formula and so it begs the question, why tell more than one of these true stories?

I DO relate to this movie quite well.  HOWEVER, as good of a movie as this is, the writers came up short...literally.We get to see just a glimpse into Ms. Johnson's (played wonderfully by Michelle Pfeiffer) experience teaching and dealing with the students.  That glimpse was not enough.  Too many things were not given any form of closure by the end of the movie.  It seems to me that the 99 minutes was NOT enough to give this movie the time it needed.  Personally, I would have liked to have seen Ms. Johnson's character take-on the principal, Mr. Grandey, and win.  We needed some closure with his out-of-touch ways of running the school.  After all, if he DID allow Emilio (played by Wade Dominguez) to speak to him, Emilio may not have been killed.  Another important part that was needed but missing, was the GRADUATION.  Instead, we get a movie that builds up our passion but slams the door way too soon as the ending credits roll. George Dzundza's character, Hal Griffith, was unnecessary and did not offer us much.This movie COULD have had the impact of Dead Poets Society if only there was the viewer's satisfaction of seeing Mr. Grandey get fired or demoted.  As mentioned, seeing the students take some sort of final exam or standardized test that showed how much Pfeiffer's character helped her students to graduate, would have been one of the most joyful, yet tear-jerking part of this movie.  Everything didn't have to end up all peaches and cream happy, but, bottom line is, at least to me, the movie needed more closure.As an instructor, I'd give this movie an ""I"" for ""INCOMPLETE,"" but with potential for a solid ""A.""",3,"Good Movie That Had a Lot of Potential, But.....",1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,1749,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS.I', 'AM', 'teacher', 'Most', 'students', 'ARE', 'urban', 'inner-city', 'environment', 'DO', 'relate', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'HOWEVER', 'good', 'movie', 'writers', 'came', 'up', 'short', 'literally.We', 'get', 'see', 'just', 'glimpse', 'Ms.', 'Johnson', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'experience', 'teaching', 'dealing', 'students', 'glimpse', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'Too', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'given', 'form', 'closure', 'end', 'movie', '99', 'minutes', 'was', 'NOT', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'time', 'needed', 'Personally', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Ms.', 'Johnson', 'character', 'take-on', 'principal', 'Mr.', 'Grandey', 'win', 'needed', 'closure', 'out-of-touch', 'ways', 'running', 'school', 'DID', 'allow', 'Emilio', 'played', 'Wade', 'Dominguez', 'speak', 'Emilio', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'important', 'part', 'was', 'needed', 'missing', 'was', 'GRADUATION', 'Instead', 'get', 'movie', 'up', 'passion', 'door', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'ending', 'credits', 'roll', 'George', 'Dzundza', 'character', 'Hal', 'Griffith', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'did', 'not', 'offer', 'much.This', 'movie', 'COULD', 'have', 'had', 'impact', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'only', 'was', 'viewer', 'satisfaction', 'seeing', 'Mr.', 'Grandey', 'get', 'fired', 'demoted', 'mentioned', 'seeing', 'students', 'take', 'sort', 'final', 'exam', 'standardized', 'test', 'showed', 'how', 'much', 'Pfeiffer', 'character', 'helped', 'students', 'graduate', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'joyful', 'yet', 'tear-jerking', 'part', 'movie', 'Everything', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'end', 'up', 'peaches', 'cream', 'happy', 'bottom', 'line', 'least', 'movie', 'needed', 'more', 'closure.As', 'instructor', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'INCOMPLETE', 'potential', 'solid']",N/A

Smith has such an anonymous name is a kind of poetic irony, in that no one remembers any of his films. Except, that is, Dangerous Minds, and the only reason they remember that one is because it has a really great main title, supplied by Coolio (Billboard chart-topper ""Gangsta's Paradise"").You've seen this movie a thousand times before; that it's based on a more recent piece of nonfiction does not in any way downplay it's overt similarities to movies going all the way back to Boys Town. Louanne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer, the movie's real gem) is an ex-drill sergeant in the Marines taking on her toughest assignment: a class full of troubled high school kids. Her ally is old friend Hal Griffith (Law and Order's George Dzundza, who does what he can with what he's got, which isn't much), and her enemy is the school principal, George Grandey (Law and Order: Criminal Intent's Courtney B. Vance), who despite being based on a nonfictional character is the essence of the two-dimensional Evil Nemesis(TM). Caught in the middle are the kids themselves, whom Johnson is forced to manipulate into wanting to learn. Some of the kids (most of whom were acting in their first film, and have not acted since) give surprising turns of flair in this movie, but in all honesty they're not enough to warrant going out of your way to watch this. Andy Garcia (cast for the movie, but whose scenes were cut before release) may have been able to spice this up; he steals every film he appears in, or did back when this came out. As it stands, it's something you've seen so many times before that by the very predictable end, you find yourself asking ""is that really all there is?"" **",2,You've seen this before a hundred times.,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,1741,"['Dangerous', 'Minds', 'John', 'N.', 'Smith', '1995', 'longtime', 'director', 'John', 'N.', 'Smith', 'such', 'anonymous', 'name', 'kind', 'poetic', 'irony', 'one', 'films', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', 'only', 'reason', 'remember', 'one', 'really', 'great', 'main', 'title', 'supplied', 'Coolio', 'Billboard', 'chart-topper', 'Gangsta', 'Paradise', '.You', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'thousand', 'times', 'before', 'based', 'more', 'recent', 'piece', 'nonfiction', 'not', 'way', 'overt', 'similarities', 'movies', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'Boys', 'Town', 'Louanne', 'Johnson', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'movie', 'real', 'gem', 'ex-drill', 'sergeant', 'Marines', 'taking', 'toughest', 'assignment', 'class', 'full', 'troubled', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'ally', 'old', 'friend', 'Hal', 'Griffith', 'Law', 'Order', 'George', 'Dzundza', 'who', 'what', 'can', 'what', 'got', ""n't"", 'much', 'enemy', 'school', 'principal', 'George', 'Grandey', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'Courtney', 'B.', 'Vance', 'who', 'being', 'based', 'nonfictional', 'character', 'essence', 'two-dimensional', 'Evil', 'Nemesis', 'TM', 'Caught', 'middle', 'are', 'kids', 'whom', 'Johnson', 'forced', 'manipulate', 'wanting', 'learn', 'kids', 'most', 'whom', 'were', 'acting', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'acted', 'give', 'surprising', 'turns', 'flair', 'movie', 'honesty', ""'re"", 'not', 'enough', 'warrant', 'going', 'way', 'watch', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'cast', 'movie', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'release', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'spice', 'up', 'film', 'did', 'back', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'very', 'predictable', 'end', 'find', 'asking', 'really', '**']",N/A

If you didn't catch it in the opening, it is based on a true story, and that in and of itself is an awesome testimony of hope. I think that Louanne Johnson would ask for no sympathy being a former Marine. I remember seeing this movie the year after I graduated and enjoying the song, ""Gangsta's Paradise"" by rapper, Coolio. It was a major status symbol that made this movie great. That was almost 10 years ago. Today, I find myself having a major problem with that song. Listen to the lyrics closely enough, and it appears that Coolio is plain feeling sorry for himself, bathing himself in self pity. That, in my opinion, contradicts the movie by saying, ""I am nothing more than a victim of circumstances."" Boo-hoo-hoo!! I don't know how many jobs I've been fired from, only to dust myself off and get another one. You are only a victim if you make yourself a victim.Michelle Pfeiffer played an awesome role, the encourager. You take a close look at the role of Courtney Vance as the principal, the one who wants you to knock before entering and you can't help but ask a simple question, ""Is he a prick, or a piller of society?""
