1158466,A26A3IVR1CQKFV,B00181NF0M,Constance Thomas,"[1, 1]","This movie was awesome!!! Totally unexpected. From some negative reviews I didn't really expect too much,went into it with an open mind. But I was completely shocked! This movie is a fast paced roller coaster ride, with highs and lows, and massive plot twists all the way to the very end. It is an action packed thriller with mystery thrown into the mix. I wonder if the other negative reviewers even watched it all the way through?! Admittedly the first half seems a bit slow, and you are unsure as to where the plot is going, but once it hits the intermission, its a RACE to the finish line at the end. This movie is NOT about horse racing. Not really. That is only a very small part in the big picture of the plot. It's about two brothers, and their cunning plans with each other, and their girls. The last forty-five minutes or so you meet a third man, and HIS girl, and then things really start to get interesting. I won't spoil it by telling you any of the plot. You just have to sit through the whole thing yourself. I will say though, that if there are any females out there that are not already in love with Saif, then they will be with this movie. He is HOT, HOT, HOT in this role! Awesome blending in his character with sweet good guy, and cunning mind. Loved it! Just stick with it, and sit through the whole thing. You won't be disappointed.",5,Action Packed RACE to the end!,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,1354,"['movie', 'was', 'awesome', 'Totally', 'unexpected', 'negative', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'went', 'open', 'mind', 'was', 'completely', 'shocked', 'movie', 'fast', 'paced', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'highs', 'lows', 'massive', 'plot', 'twists', 'way', 'very', 'end', 'action', 'packed', 'thriller', 'mystery', 'thrown', 'mix', 'wonder', 'other', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'even', 'watched', 'way', 'Admittedly', 'first', 'half', 'bit', 'slow', 'are', 'unsure', 'where', 'plot', 'going', 'intermission', 'RACE', 'finish', 'line', 'end', 'movie', 'NOT', 'horse', 'racing', 'Not', 'really', 'only', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'big', 'picture', 'plot', 'two', 'brothers', 'cunning', 'plans', 'other', 'girls', 'last', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'so', 'meet', 'third', 'man', 'HIS', 'girl', 'then', 'things', 'really', 'start', 'get', 'interesting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'telling', 'plot', 'just', 'have', 'sit', 'whole', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'females', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'not', 'already', 'love', 'Saif', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'HOT', 'HOT', 'HOT', 'role', 'Awesome', 'blending', 'character', 'sweet', 'good', 'guy', 'cunning', 'mind', 'Loved', 'Just', 'stick', 'sit', 'whole', 'thing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Race

The location is exotic, the ensemble cast gorgeous, and the fast-paced plot filled with hairpin turns you never see coming. To top it off, the songs rock! The story revolves around two brothers, Ranvir and Rajeev (played by Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna), who own a stud farm for racehorses in South Africa. Ranvir is a ruthless businessman and Rajeev a bitter alcoholic--and their fierce competition with one another turns deadly. Their love interests, Sonia and Sophia (Bipasha Basu and Katrina Kaif), women with dark pasts and secret agendas, complicate the brothers' rivalry. A sly police inspector (Anil Kapoor) and his dingbat assistant (Sameera Reddy) are charged with solving the delicious murder mystery that develops. All the double-crosses keep you guessing who the villains are--and who's on whose side--right up to the end. While the story is far-fetched at times, Race is one hell of a ride. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",4,Must See,1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,1052,"['Sexy', 'stylish', 'sensational', 'movie', 'location', 'exotic', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'gorgeous', 'fast-paced', 'plot', 'filled', 'hairpin', 'turns', 'never', 'see', 'coming', 'top', 'off', 'songs', 'rock', 'story', 'around', 'two', 'brothers', 'Ranvir', 'Rajeev', 'played', 'Saif', 'Ali', 'Khan', 'Akshaye', 'Khanna', 'who', 'own', 'stud', 'farm', 'racehorses', 'South', 'Africa', 'Ranvir', 'ruthless', 'businessman', 'Rajeev', 'bitter', 'alcoholic', 'fierce', 'competition', 'one', 'deadly', 'love', 'interests', 'Sonia', 'Sophia', 'Bipasha', 'Basu', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'women', 'dark', 'pasts', 'secret', 'agendas', 'complicate', 'brothers', 'rivalry', 'sly', 'police', 'inspector', 'Anil', 'Kapoor', 'dingbat', 'assistant', 'Sameera', 'Reddy', 'are', 'charged', 'solving', 'delicious', 'murder', 'mystery', 'double-crosses', 'keep', 'guessing', 'who', 'villains', 'are', 'who', 'side', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'story', 'far-fetched', 'times', 'Race', 'one', 'hell', 'ride', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",Race

Older brother (Saif Ali Khan) has always been the winner against younger one (Akshaye Khanna). Older one loves the younger one but younger one has a chip on his shoulder and wants to get rid of older one. Older has a girlfriend (Bipasha Basu) and a secretary (Katrina Kaif) who also figure in the plot. Then there is fruit obsessed police inspector (Anil Kapoor) and his assistant (Sameera Reddy) who come to solve an alleged suicide.., and a racing rival (Dalip Tahil) who plays dirty. This is all set around the race tracks and a South African glamor world of beautiful models and wealth.Now if you took this as a straight movie you'd have to mark it down as stereotyped and corny. However the whole thing is so outrageous (in a Dhoom sort of way) and almost no character is what they appear. Just about everyone has agendas, double crosses etc. If you just go with it as almost a send-up played straight, it ended up being quite a lot of fun. It is a thriller-action movie that really has little violence in it nor fight sequences. There are some chases for those that like that. There is no real connection between romantic couples yet the whole thing is almost cartoon in quality . So, in that context it isn't a problem as you don't expect depth.The music is contemporary and the dance scenes high-octane sexy ones yet none of the music remained with me as it did with Dhoom 2 for instance.So if you are art-house forget it. If you like serious drama and serious thrillers you may have your doubts. It isn't played as comedy but nonetheless can be quite entertaining as you wade through the plot twists and the eventually predictable double dealings.Elsewhere on the Net it tends to get a little above average. However quite a few really hated it and just as many rated it a high winner. I think it's expectations and how you approach it that explains that difference. It's no Dhoom 2 but I had fun with it and its one of those odd ones that's a keeper. A sequel has been announced using other top Bollywood stars so enough people probably liked it.",4,An almost cartoon-like thriller/action flick: a lot of fun if you don't take any of it seriously (and a sequel is in the works),1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,2167,"['2', 'stepbrothers', 'who', 'growing', 'up', 'Durbin', 'South', 'Africa', 'have', 'always', 'turned', 'everything', 'race', 'Older', 'brother', 'Saif', 'Ali', 'Khan', 'always', 'been', 'winner', 'younger', 'one', 'Akshaye', 'Khanna', 'Older', 'one', 'younger', 'one', 'younger', 'one', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'get', 'rid', 'older', 'one', 'Older', 'girlfriend', 'Bipasha', 'Basu', 'secretary', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'who', 'also', 'figure', 'plot', 'Then', 'fruit', 'obsessed', 'police', 'inspector', 'Anil', 'Kapoor', 'assistant', 'Sameera', 'Reddy', 'who', 'come', 'solve', 'alleged', 'suicide..', 'racing', 'rival', 'Dalip', 'Tahil', 'who', 'dirty', 'set', 'race', 'tracks', 'South', 'African', 'glamor', 'world', 'beautiful', 'models', 'wealth.Now', 'took', 'straight', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'mark', 'down', 'stereotyped', 'corny', 'However', 'whole', 'thing', 'so', 'outrageous', 'Dhoom', 'sort', 'way', 'almost', 'character', 'what', 'appear', 'Just', 'everyone', 'agendas', 'double', 'crosses', 'etc', 'just', 'go', 'almost', 'send-up', 'played', 'straight', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'quite', 'lot', 'fun', 'thriller-action', 'movie', 'really', 'little', 'violence', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'chases', 'like', 'real', 'connection', 'romantic', 'couples', 'yet', 'whole', 'thing', 'almost', 'cartoon', 'quality', 'So', 'context', ""n't"", 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'depth.The', 'music', 'contemporary', 'dance', 'high-octane', 'sexy', 'ones', 'yet', 'none', 'music', 'remained', 'did', 'Dhoom', '2', 'instance.So', 'are', 'art-house', 'forget', 'like', 'serious', 'drama', 'serious', 'thrillers', 'may', 'have', 'doubts', ""n't"", 'played', 'comedy', 'nonetheless', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'wade', 'plot', 'twists', 'eventually', 'predictable', 'double', 'dealings.Elsewhere', 'Net', 'get', 'little', 'above', 'average', 'However', 'quite', 'few', 'really', 'hated', 'just', 'many', 'rated', 'high', 'winner', 'think', 'expectations', 'how', 'approach', 'difference', 'Dhoom', '2', 'had', 'fun', 'one', 'odd', 'ones', 'keeper', 'sequel', 'been', 'announced', 'using', 'other', 'top', 'Bollywood', 'stars', 'so', 'enough', 'people', 'probably', 'liked']",Race
1158470,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00181NF0M,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Race (Abbas Alibhai Burmawalla and Mastan Alibhai Burmawalla, 2008)I won't say Race is the worst movie I watched this week&#8212;that dishonor goes to the painful Black Forest&#8212;but if the brothers Burmawalla were trying to come up with a bad American made-for-TV thriller, they couldn't have done a better job than this. Every time I watch one of those epic-length Bollywood films (and this one, clocking in just under 2:45, is actually pretty short for a big-budget Bollywood musical thriller), I find myself wondering how they're going to stretch the usually-thin story out to such a length. In this case, they didn't even try; every once in a while they just changed the story surrounding the core thriller, and any attempts to stick the surrounding pieces together were absent.Plot: Ranvir (Kal Ho Naa Ho's Saif Ali Khan) and Rajiv (Taal's Akshaye Khanna) are stepbrothers who run one of the world's most powerful Thoroughbred breeding operations. (It's not coincidence, methinks, that Khan bears a passing resemblance to Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa al-Makhtoum and Khanna to his brother Hamdan; the Makhtoum family actually do.) Ranvir is dating a high fashion model, Sonia (Jism's Bipasha Basou), but when Rajiv meets her, it's love at first sight. Not that Ranvir's complaining, his secretary Sophia (Ek Tha Tiger's Katrina Kaif) is a knockout herself. The two brothers are as close as can be on the surface, but it turns out there's all sorts of familial baggage there; in the opening scene of the film, there is an attempt on Ranvir's life, and we find out pretty early on that Rajiv was behind it. His second attempt, after Rajiv and Sonia have been married a few years, is more successful, and it turns out that Rajiv, who had a $20 million insurance policy on his brother, had forgotten about the fact that their father had a $100 million policy on each. Score! Enter, however, Inspector Robert D'Costa (Slumdog Millionaire's Anil Kapoor) and his assistant Mini (Darna Mana Hai's Sameera Reddy), who finds the whole thing suspicious.Pretty much every twist in this movie you'll see coming from a mile off (there was one that took me by surprise), and the scenery around them is so generic as to be utterly replaceable, with car chases galore, romance subplots that stumble over their own feet on a regular basis, improbable deaths and even more improbable returns, and of course a Poirot moment (where, in flashback, we see all the bits of the narrative we were missing that made it a mystery). The whole is patently ridiculous. The few places it does work are when the movie falls back on generic Bollywood trappings, for example the inevitable comedy that surfaces every once in a while; that works, in the often-uncomfortable Bollywood style. And, well, a car chase is a car chase, so if you're a fan of car chases,  you'll be amused enough when it's happening. But those minor things probably won't be enough to leave you with a good feeling when the movie's over; they certainly weren't enough for me. **",2,Dawdle.,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,3026,"['Race', 'Abbas', 'Alibhai', 'Burmawalla', 'Mastan', 'Alibhai', 'Burmawalla', '2008', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'Race', 'worst', 'movie', 'watched', 'week', '8212', 'dishonor', 'painful', 'Black', 'Forest', '8212', 'brothers', 'Burmawalla', 'were', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'bad', 'American', 'made-for-TV', 'thriller', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'time', 'watch', 'one', 'epic-length', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'one', 'clocking', 'just', '2:45', 'actually', 'pretty', 'short', 'big-budget', 'Bollywood', 'musical', 'thriller', 'find', 'wondering', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'stretch', 'usually-thin', 'story', 'length', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'once', 'while', 'just', 'changed', 'story', 'surrounding', 'core', 'thriller', 'attempts', 'stick', 'surrounding', 'pieces', 'together', 'were', 'absent.Plot', 'Ranvir', 'Kal', 'Ho', 'Naa', 'Ho', 'Saif', 'Ali', 'Khan', 'Rajiv', 'Taal', 'Akshaye', 'Khanna', 'are', 'stepbrothers', 'who', 'run', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'powerful', 'Thoroughbred', 'breeding', 'operations', 'not', 'coincidence', 'methinks', 'Khan', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'Sheikh', 'Mohammed', 'bin', 'Khalifa', 'al-Makhtoum', 'Khanna', 'brother', 'Hamdan', 'Makhtoum', 'family', 'actually', 'do', 'Ranvir', 'dating', 'high', 'fashion', 'model', 'Sonia', 'Jism', 'Bipasha', 'Basou', 'when', 'Rajiv', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Not', 'Ranvir', 'complaining', 'secretary', 'Sophia', 'Ek', 'Tha', 'Tiger', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'knockout', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'be', 'surface', 'out', 'sorts', 'familial', 'baggage', 'there', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'attempt', 'Ranvir', 'life', 'find', 'out', 'pretty', 'early', 'Rajiv', 'was', 'second', 'attempt', 'Rajiv', 'Sonia', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'few', 'years', 'more', 'successful', 'out', 'Rajiv', 'who', 'had', '20', 'million', 'insurance', 'policy', 'brother', 'had', 'forgotten', 'fact', 'father', 'had', '100', 'million', 'policy', 'Score', 'Enter', 'however', 'Inspector', 'Robert', ""D'Costa"", 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'Anil', 'Kapoor', 'assistant', 'Mini', 'Darna', 'Mana', 'Hai', 'Sameera', 'Reddy', 'who', 'whole', 'thing', 'suspicious.Pretty', 'much', 'twist', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'off', 'was', 'one', 'took', 'surprise', 'scenery', 'so', 'generic', 'be', 'utterly', 'replaceable', 'car', 'chases', 'galore', 'romance', 'subplots', 'stumble', 'own', 'feet', 'regular', 'basis', 'improbable', 'deaths', 'even', 'more', 'improbable', 'returns', 'course', 'Poirot', 'moment', 'where', 'flashback', 'see', 'bits', 'narrative', 'were', 'missing', 'made', 'mystery', 'whole', 'patently', 'ridiculous', 'few', 'places', 'work', 'are', 'when', 'movie', 'back', 'generic', 'Bollywood', 'trappings', 'example', 'inevitable', 'comedy', 'once', 'while', 'often-uncomfortable', 'Bollywood', 'style', 'well', 'car', 'chase', 'car', 'chase', 'so', ""'re"", 'fan', 'car', 'chases', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amused', 'enough', 'when', 'happening', 'minor', 'things', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'enough', 'leave', 'good', 'feeling', 'when', 'movie', 'certainly', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', '**']",Race
