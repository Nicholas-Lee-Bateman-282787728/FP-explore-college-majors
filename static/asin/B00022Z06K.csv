However, this version has about 10 minutes of extra footage. The DVD focuses on the early part of the French and Indian War, most specifically on little-known, but important, Braddock's Defeat. Within this time frame, we follow George Washington and learn of his many mistakes and watch him grow as a leader. We see how Washington gained valuable experience in leadership and warfare that would serve him as leader of the Revolutionary forces. I was also interested to hear of the various native tribes as participants in the war with their own geo-political goals and aspirations and not just as pawns of the British or French.The presentation is great and the information is interesting and important for an understanding of early American history. There are pictures, reenactments, and comments from scholars and historians. I was happy to see that a British historian was included. I give this documentary my highest recommendation.",5,Fantastic DVD on French and Indian War!,1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,1042,"['special', 'release', 'video', 'same', 'name', 'see', 'review', '_When', 'Forest', 'Ran', 'Red_', 'VHS', 'However', 'version', '10', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'DVD', 'early', 'part', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'most', 'specifically', 'little-known', 'important', 'Braddock', 'Defeat', 'time', 'frame', 'follow', 'George', 'Washington', 'learn', 'many', 'mistakes', 'watch', 'grow', 'leader', 'see', 'how', 'Washington', 'gained', 'valuable', 'experience', 'leadership', 'warfare', 'would', 'serve', 'leader', 'Revolutionary', 'forces', 'was', 'also', 'interested', 'hear', 'various', 'native', 'tribes', 'participants', 'war', 'own', 'geo-political', 'goals', 'aspirations', 'not', 'just', 'pawns', 'British', 'French.The', 'presentation', 'great', 'information', 'interesting', 'important', 'understanding', 'early', 'American', 'history', 'are', 'pictures', 'reenactments', 'comments', 'scholars', 'historians', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'British', 'historian', 'was', 'included', 'give', 'documentary', 'highest', 'recommendation']",N/A

In addition to a detailed analysis of what actually happened at the Battle of the Monongahela, I thought the program expertly explained the events leading up to the battle as well.  The tale is told with re-enactments, quotes from period sources (e.g. George Washington's letters) and, because photography didn't yet exist, artwork depicting various events and people central to the story.Along with the main program the DVD also includes a ""making of"" feature, an interview with a period historian, and even some ""deleted scenes.""

It was interesting nevertheless because it showed how the Indians manipulated a young continental officer (George Washington) into starting the French and Indian War.  To me it is amazing that George Washington never won a battle during the French and Indian War, yet was appointed by the Continental Congress to lead the army during the American Revolution.

Still worth watching and very factual, it covers the French and Indian wars roots. It talks about Fort Necessity and the massacre at Fort DuQuense.

It discusses an inexperienced George Washington and his Virginia Militia going into the Ohio Valley with their Indian Half King ally to confront the French in this disputed area.The massacre of the French precipitated the war here.The British General, Braddock, then is defeated soon afterward in this area, too.This is a well-done PBS documentary.  If you had to choose only one documentary, however, I would suggest you consider &#34;The War That Made America,&#34; another by PBS, as it goes much deeper into not only these beginnings of the war, but continues onward from there.&#34;When the Forest Ran Red&#34; is a single DVD, and restricts itself to only a couple of actions within this region of the country.
