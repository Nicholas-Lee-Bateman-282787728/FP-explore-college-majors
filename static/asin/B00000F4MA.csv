498514,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00000F4MA,A Customer,"[3, 22]","Summary:Spider (Ralph Fiennes) has just been released from a mental hospital and is being sent to a boarding/halfway house.  Coinciding with his release from the hospital he begins to relive his childhood and the beginning of his journey that eventually led to him ending up in a mental hospital.  The audience then follows Spider as he explores the 'webs' of his past that, though it isn't obvious initially, are a cross between truth and fiction.  Along the way we are introduced to Spider's father, Bill Cleg (Gabriel Byrne), his mother, Mrs. Cleg (Miranda Richardson), who, though you don't realize it at first, also turns out to be Yvonne (who is supposed to be a prostitute and his father's second wife) and Mrs. Wilkinson at different points (Yvonne and Mrs. Cleg are played by Miranda Richardson and she does a few scenes as Mrs. Wilkinson).  It isn't until the very end of the movie that we begin to realize that the past we are experiencing is the past as Spider has created it in order to come to terms with what he has actually done that got him sent to the mental hospital..My Comments:The movie is kind of interesting and... very independent filmy.  Without the explanations of what was going on and what the symbolism of the movie is supposed to be by the director in the director's commentary and the featurettes this movie would be almost entirely unintelligible, in large part because even though Spider is supposed to be schizophrenic the portrayal is not by the book.  As David Cronenberg points out, they let the character just turn into who he was with some initial influence from official diagnoses of schizophrenia; so Spider isn't actually the stereotypical schizophrenic, he is the Hollywood, Indy film version.So, what about the story?  Well, when you can kind of understand what is going on it seems engaging and when things are explained after you watch the movie it almost works.  It's actually kind of hard to criticize the story because it is all just inside the mind of someone who is recognized as being mentally incapable.  Without that leeway, the story is very illogical.  But because this is all inside the mind of a schizophrenic, it's passable.The acting?  The acting is actually very good.  As much as I like Gabriel Byrne, I think he was actually the weakest actor of the group.  Admittedly he had a very difficult role, much more difficult than the older and younger Spiders, but at times it just wasn't very convincing.  Miranda Richardson was particularly good.  She has to be commended for convincingly playing 3 separate roles (though there is some overlap between them) and being so convincing that you don't realize at first that she is actually the same person playing all three roles.  I do like Ralph Fiennes and, like Billy Bob Thornton, am I continuously surprised as he successfully portrays more and more roles.  But I just can't give him too much credit for this performance - he didn't actually have to say anything intelligible; all he really had to do was walk around strangely and mutter.  I'm sure that it was difficult to do, but there was no real variety in the role - it was the same thing from scene to scene.Overall, the acting is really pretty terrific but the story needed to be slightly clearer.  Finding out in the end that it was Spider that killed his mother (I just gave away the story, sorry) was actually a major let down.  You find out in one scene and that's it, it's all over.  If you're not carefully paying attention and actually trying to get what is going on you'll probably miss it.  Anyway, if you like Cronenberg films, Ralph Fiennes, or independent films that require an explanation, you'll probably enjoy this.  If not, well, you'll want to skip this one.",2,Need the director's commentary to make any sense of it,1057795200,"07 10, 2003",2003,3743,"['Summary', 'Spider', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'mental', 'hospital', 'being', 'sent', 'boarding/halfway', 'house', 'Coinciding', 'release', 'hospital', 'relive', 'childhood', 'beginning', 'journey', 'eventually', 'led', 'ending', 'up', 'mental', 'hospital', 'audience', 'then', 'Spider', ""'webs"", ""'"", 'past', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'initially', 'are', 'cross', 'truth', 'fiction', 'way', 'are', 'introduced', 'Spider', 'father', 'Bill', 'Cleg', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Cleg', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'first', 'also', 'out', 'be', 'Yvonne', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'prostitute', 'father', 'second', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Wilkinson', 'different', 'points', 'Yvonne', 'Mrs.', 'Cleg', 'are', 'played', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'few', 'scenes', 'Mrs.', 'Wilkinson', ""n't"", 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'begin', 'realize', 'past', 'are', 'experiencing', 'past', 'Spider', 'created', 'order', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'actually', 'done', 'got', 'sent', 'mental', 'hospital..My', 'Comments', 'movie', 'kind', 'interesting', 'very', 'independent', 'filmy', 'explanations', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'symbolism', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'director', 'director', 'commentary', 'featurettes', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'entirely', 'unintelligible', 'large', 'part', 'even', 'Spider', 'supposed', 'be', 'schizophrenic', 'portrayal', 'not', 'book', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'out', 'let', 'character', 'just', 'turn', 'who', 'was', 'initial', 'influence', 'official', 'diagnoses', 'schizophrenia', 'Spider', ""n't"", 'actually', 'stereotypical', 'schizophrenic', 'Hollywood', 'Indy', 'film', 'version.So', 'what', 'story', 'Well', 'when', 'can', 'kind', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'engaging', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'explained', 'watch', 'movie', 'almost', 'actually', 'kind', 'hard', 'criticize', 'story', 'just', 'mind', 'someone', 'who', 'recognized', 'being', 'mentally', 'incapable', 'leeway', 'story', 'very', 'illogical', 'mind', 'schizophrenic', 'passable.The', 'acting', 'acting', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'think', 'was', 'actually', 'weakest', 'actor', 'group', 'Admittedly', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'role', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'older', 'younger', 'Spiders', 'times', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'convincing', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'was', 'particularly', 'good', 'be', 'commended', 'convincingly', 'playing', '3', 'separate', 'roles', 'overlap', 'being', 'so', 'convincing', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'first', 'actually', 'same', 'person', 'playing', 'three', 'roles', 'do', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'am', 'continuously', 'surprised', 'successfully', 'more', 'more', 'roles', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'have', 'say', 'anything', 'intelligible', 'really', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'walk', 'strangely', 'mutter', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'difficult', 'do', 'was', 'real', 'variety', 'role', 'was', 'same', 'thing', 'scene', 'scene.Overall', 'acting', 'really', 'pretty', 'terrific', 'story', 'needed', 'be', 'slightly', 'clearer', 'Finding', 'out', 'end', 'was', 'Spider', 'killed', 'mother', 'just', 'gave', 'away', 'story', 'sorry', 'was', 'actually', 'major', 'let', 'down', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'scene', 'over', ""'re"", 'not', 'carefully', 'paying', 'attention', 'actually', 'trying', 'get', 'what', 'going', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'miss', 'Anyway', 'like', 'Cronenberg', 'films', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'independent', 'films', 'require', 'explanation', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'not', 'well', ""'ll"", 'want', 'skip', 'one']",Spider

498516,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000F4MA,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Maybe I just don't get him, but David Cronenberg is not a director I've readily embraced.  I haven't seen all of his films, but I've seen a number of them and each time (with the exception of `The Fly') I've walked away wondering what the attraction is.  He has a very recognizable aesthetic and I appreciate some of the ways he shapes a film (despite finding `A History of Violence' to be an uneven disappointment, there is no denying that Cronenberg's directorial efforts were outstandingly precise) but overall I find his films to be so much less than they could have been.`Spider' is not the exception.The overall premise of the film is one I found astutely interesting.  I wanted to dive into this with reckless abandonment and really uncover something golden.  Instead, I was left with half a film, a film that had great promise but seemed to crash under the weight of its own attempts.It tried very hard.The film follows a schizophrenic man who is forced to face his own demons when he is released from a mental institution and takes up in a halfway house in his old neighborhood.  In the vicinity of tragic memories, Spider starts to pick at his past, revisiting moments he remembers well and jumbling them up to create a faux reality he initiated at childhood, a reality that cost him his sanity (not to mention his family).Visually, the film is a gritty masterclass of disturbed realism.  You can feel the sickness melting off the walls and swallowing each and every scene.  The acting is also nearly flawless.  Miranda Richardson steals the whole show with a dual-role performance as the woman who poked all the holes in Spider's mind; his mother.  What she does for the film is immense, but the film cannot survive on the mood and performances alone.  Where the film fails is in the construction.  The jumbled reality that Spider creates for himself gets lost in the visual, remaining confusing and underdeveloped.  The flashbacks that become present-day reenactments become tiresomely crafted.  I wanted to indulge but I wound up wishing the film would just get on with it.In the end it remains an interesting exercise and one that I would not be apposed to revisit.  Richardson is award worthy, and Fiennes works seemingly effortlessly to find depths within a nearly silent character, but the end result was rather tiresome and underwhelming considering the prose.I just expected something more here.",3,It gets it half right...,1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,2414,"['Maybe', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'not', 'director', ""'ve"", 'readily', 'embraced', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'time', 'exception', 'Fly', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'away', 'wondering', 'what', 'attraction', 'very', 'recognizable', 'aesthetic', 'appreciate', 'ways', 'film', 'finding', 'History', 'Violence', 'be', 'uneven', 'disappointment', 'denying', 'Cronenberg', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'were', 'outstandingly', 'precise', 'overall', 'find', 'films', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'could', 'have', 'been.', 'Spider', 'not', 'exception.The', 'overall', 'premise', 'film', 'one', 'found', 'astutely', 'interesting', 'wanted', 'dive', 'reckless', 'abandonment', 'really', 'uncover', 'something', 'golden', 'Instead', 'was', 'left', 'film', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'promise', 'seemed', 'crash', 'weight', 'own', 'attempts.It', 'tried', 'very', 'hard.The', 'film', 'schizophrenic', 'man', 'who', 'forced', 'face', 'own', 'demons', 'when', 'released', 'mental', 'institution', 'up', 'halfway', 'house', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'vicinity', 'tragic', 'memories', 'Spider', 'pick', 'past', 'revisiting', 'moments', 'well', 'jumbling', 'up', 'create', 'faux', 'reality', 'initiated', 'childhood', 'reality', 'cost', 'sanity', 'not', 'mention', 'family', '.Visually', 'film', 'gritty', 'masterclass', 'disturbed', 'realism', 'can', 'feel', 'sickness', 'melting', 'off', 'walls', 'swallowing', 'scene', 'acting', 'also', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'whole', 'show', 'dual-role', 'performance', 'woman', 'who', 'poked', 'holes', 'Spider', 'mind', 'mother', 'What', 'film', 'immense', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'survive', 'mood', 'performances', 'alone', 'Where', 'film', 'construction', 'jumbled', 'reality', 'Spider', 'lost', 'visual', 'remaining', 'confusing', 'underdeveloped', 'flashbacks', 'become', 'present-day', 'reenactments', 'become', 'tiresomely', 'crafted', 'wanted', 'indulge', 'wound', 'up', 'wishing', 'film', 'would', 'just', 'get', 'it.In', 'end', 'interesting', 'exercise', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'apposed', 'revisit', 'Richardson', 'award', 'worthy', 'Fiennes', 'seemingly', 'effortlessly', 'find', 'depths', 'nearly', 'silent', 'character', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'rather', 'tiresome', 'underwhelming', 'considering', 'prose.I', 'just', 'expected', 'something', 'more', 'here']",Spider

So, I was expecting another sledgehammer to my brain with SPIDER. WOW! I was totally wrong. SPIDER concerns a man of the same name (Ralph Fiennes) who returns to his childhood neighborhood after spending most of his life in a mental institution. SPIDER spends most of his time wandering the empty streets, mumbling to himself. To any sane person, he looks like a nut without purpose or direction. However, he is actually a detective, in search of the clues that will help him solve the mystery of his own life. We get to tag along with SPIDER on his mission and see things through his eyes, feel as he feels. We get a reality that only exists in SPIDER's mind. Pretty soon, I personally found myself lost in SPIDER's way of looking at things. I was able to accept and enjoy the story on it's own terms. Miranda Richardson is excellent in her dual role (actually 3 roles) as Spider's mother and the ""other"" woman who replaces her. Gabriel Byrne is SPIDER's father, who is seen as both an evil drunkard, and a calm, loving man in SPIDER's head. In the sticky web of SPIDER's shattered psyche, memories are just dead husks, bearing some vague resemblance to the original events. SPIDER must discover the truth within the reality he's fashioned for himself. We go with him as he investigates the darkest corners of his past. Things are not as they appear and we're in for a surprise. Bleak and disturbing, yet I found this movie to have a warmth and light of it's own. Inventive and haunting.

498520,AP3VHIZBRGO9X,B00000F4MA,"C. ANZIULEWICZ ""Chuck Anziulewicz""","[10, 15]","As a film in itself ""Spider"" is okay, but David Cronenberg's film fails, regrettably, as an adaptation of Patrick McGrath's excellent novel. All the more surprising, since McGrath is credited with the screenplay.THE MOVIE, BY ITSELF ... is very deliberately paced. It requires something that growing numbers of MTV-generation movie fans lack: An attention span. And anyone looking for Cronenberg's trademark grotesquerie will be disappointed; this is, as many reviewers have already pointed out, Cronenberg's most ""mainstream"" effort to date. But there are some good performances here. Ralph Fiennes immerses himself in the twitchy, nicotine-stained shabbiness of the title role, and the always-fabulous Miranda Richardson displays her formidable range as one, then two, then later three different characters. And where did they find Bradley Hall, the young actor who plays Dennis Clegg (Spider) as a boy? They must have had photos of Ralph Fiennes at the age of ten and used them during the casting call. Sadly, there's not much of a story, though there might have been had Cronenberg been more faithful to the novel. And if you've either read the novel or think you might do so in the future, please read on ...AS AN ADAPTATION OF THE NOVEL ... this film is pretty damned disappointing. Patrick McGrath's novel is told in the first person by Dennis Clegg, a schizophrenic who is trying to make some kind of transition from the asylum to something resembling normal life. But he's not taking his medication, and he's losing his fragile grip on reality. At least in the book we have a cohesive narrative, however delusional, by Spider himself ... but that's completely missing from the film, replaced instead by Fiennes' muttering incomprehensibly to himself throughout the picture, so the viewer is forced to speculate about Spider's history and what's going on in his head. I will admit that director Cronenberg does and admirable job of portraying working class London, and the scenes filmed down at the allotments were almost exactly as I had pictured them in my mind while reading the book. But Cronenberg squanders some great opportunities to translate some of the more hallucinatory aspects of Spider's story to the screen. And I was most disappointed by how Cronenberg changed the ending of the story; at least in the book Spider was capable of making some choices, however final, but in this film that choice is taken away from him.David Cronenberg is capable of making successful film adapations of books. Consider his treatment of ""The Dead Zone"" by Stephen King, which most consider the best film adaptation of any of King's novels.

498523,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00000F4MA,C. Middleton,"[23, 25]","This is a disturbing film because its depiction of madness conveys an astonishing realism. Director, David Cronenberg, (Crash, Naked Lunch and The Fly) has managed to merge the leading character's disquieting mind with the audience. This is no small task considering the subject matter, and the fact that the protagonist is suffering from intense delusions concerning his past. We see through the eyes of Spider - the memories of his childhood, though as the tale unfolds, we begin to distrust his memories and see that they blend with fantasy. The film is a study on the mechanics of repression, and the psychological notion that memory cannot be trusted.Spider (Ralph Fiennes) arrives at a halfway house somewhere in London. Mrs Wilkinson, (Lynne Redgrave) meets him at the door. This woman is everything you would expect from a proprietor of a house for newly released mental patients. It is here that we begin to learn of Spider's childhood: his relationship with his mother and father, which is the key to the cause of his present condition. Miranda Richardson plays three different roles in the film - Spider's mother, the prostitute and later, the proprietor of the halfway house. The mother and the prostitute are entirely different, but the proprietor is an impressive blending of all three. As we learn more about Spider's childhood, we really don't know what to make of his father (Gabriel Burne)...is he an abusive man, an adulterer and drunk or merely a man doing his best to cope with an unhappy marriage? Gabriel Burne admitted that this was one of the hardest roles he's had to do, because he had to play the character on a fine line, so as not to give anything away to the audience. When you see the end of the film, you'll agree that he succeeded in his intended performance.David Cronenberg is well known for his fascination with the darker more disturbing aspect of the human mind. He's one of those unique directors that will capture the right atmosphere for the subject under study; in this case, madness is realistically represented and seems to exude that strange feeling of the uncanny. A good example is the scene where Spider lays in the bathtub in the foetus position, blankly gazing into space. This is a disturbing image of a lost soul in the throes of passive insanity.I would not say that this picture is an enjoyable one, but it is certainly an intriguing journey into a troubled mind, attempting to come to terms with his past and the truth.",4,Realistic representation of madness.,1067558400,"10 31, 2003",2003,2475,"['disturbing', 'film', 'depiction', 'madness', 'conveys', 'astonishing', 'realism', 'Director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'Crash', 'Naked', 'Lunch', 'Fly', 'managed', 'merge', 'leading', 'character', 'disquieting', 'mind', 'audience', 'small', 'task', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'fact', 'protagonist', 'suffering', 'intense', 'delusions', 'concerning', 'past', 'see', 'eyes', 'Spider', 'memories', 'childhood', 'though', 'tale', 'unfolds', 'begin', 'distrust', 'memories', 'see', 'blend', 'fantasy', 'film', 'study', 'mechanics', 'repression', 'psychological', 'notion', 'memory', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'trusted.Spider', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'halfway', 'house', 'somewhere', 'London', 'Mrs', 'Wilkinson', 'Lynne', 'Redgrave', 'door', 'woman', 'everything', 'would', 'expect', 'proprietor', 'house', 'newly', 'released', 'mental', 'patients', 'here', 'begin', 'learn', 'Spider', 'childhood', 'relationship', 'mother', 'father', 'key', 'cause', 'present', 'condition', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'three', 'different', 'roles', 'film', 'Spider', 'mother', 'prostitute', 'later', 'proprietor', 'halfway', 'house', 'mother', 'prostitute', 'are', 'entirely', 'different', 'proprietor', 'impressive', 'blending', 'three', 'learn', 'more', 'Spider', 'childhood', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'father', 'Gabriel', 'Burne', 'abusive', 'man', 'adulterer', 'drunk', 'merely', 'man', 'doing', 'best', 'cope', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'Gabriel', 'Burne', 'admitted', 'was', 'one', 'hardest', 'roles', 'had', 'do', 'had', 'play', 'character', 'fine', 'line', 'so', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'audience', 'When', 'see', 'end', 'film', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'succeeded', 'intended', 'performance.David', 'Cronenberg', 'well', 'known', 'fascination', 'darker', 'more', 'disturbing', 'aspect', 'human', 'mind', 'one', 'unique', 'directors', 'will', 'capture', 'right', 'atmosphere', 'subject', 'study', 'case', 'madness', 'realistically', 'represented', 'exude', 'strange', 'feeling', 'uncanny', 'good', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Spider', 'bathtub', 'foetus', 'position', 'blankly', 'gazing', 'space', 'disturbing', 'image', 'lost', 'soul', 'throes', 'passive', 'insanity.I', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'picture', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'certainly', 'intriguing', 'journey', 'troubled', 'mind', 'attempting', 'come', 'terms', 'past', 'truth']",Spider

SPIDER dates back to 1991, before McGrath wrote ASYLUM, DR HAGGARD'S DISEASE, BUTCHER BOY, MARTHA PEAKE etc and that story showed all the promise of the author's ability to find entry into the dark interstices of the ill mind, a line of detail he continues to follow and expand.David Cronenberg, that master of the macabre, was the absolute right director to transpose this map (read 'web') of the schizophrenic mind to film.  His cast is impeccably correct:  Ralph Fiennes manages to create a three dimensional character out of the title role, while Miranda Richardson, Lynn Redgrave, and Gabriel Byrne and all the bit players feel fully in character at all times.  The grisly story is beautifully photogrpahed and meticulously scored (a very finely orchestrated score by Howard Shore) and if at times the film feels longer than the usual movie, realize that this is the way a disturbed and immobile brain deals with the outside world.For the story read the other reviews.  For your edification, buy or rent this amazingly disturbing film and keep your mind open.......Note: watching this little masterpiece of a film ten years later only serves to increase appreciation of the work of Cronenberg, Howard Shore, Ralph Fiennes, Miranda Richardson, Gabriel Byrne, and Lynn Redgrave.

498530,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00000F4MA,Jeffrey Leach,"[5, 7]","Every once in awhile I like to watch a David Cronenberg film. One thing you will always get from a Cronenberg film is a serious look at how technology and human beings interact. Like science fiction author J.G. Ballard, Cronenberg's films embrace a synthesis of man and machine that is exceedingly grim, an outlook usually complimented with generous helpings of gore. The overarching theme in his cinematic examinations seems to be that humans simply do not know enough about the technology they develop, or if they do, their arrogance in the ultimate abilities of mankind always leads them charging into experiments despite the risks. That we are just not far seeing enough to predict the outcome of using new drugs or messing around with human genetics may be a good message to take from a Cronenberg film. &quot;Spider&quot; is a departure from the above traits, resembling &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; more than it does &quot;Scanners,&quot; &quot;Shivers,&quot; or other Cronenberg films. The film is an adaptation of a novel of the same name by Patrick McGrath, a novel that takes as its central theme the devastating consequences of mental illness.Meet Dennis &quot;Spider&quot; Cleg (Ralph Fiennes), a guy with more problems than you could possibly fathom. Spider is mentally ill, a result of a problematic childhood and a horrific incident that caused his fragile mind to finally crack. When we first meet Spider he's just gotten out of the asylum and is checking into a half way house in the hope that he is finally ready to rejoin society. It's difficult to imagine Spider is ready for anything seeing as how he barely talks, spends most of his time scrawling doggerel into a tiny notebook, and has occasional outbursts of hysteric hostility over such mundane incidents as a small whiff of heating gas. Still, what do we know about mental illness? Maybe he really is ready to confront his dark past and the complexities of the modern world. In the meantime, Spider deals with the stern taskmaster in charge of the halfway house (Lynn Redgrave) and its kooky residents. As he lives in his largely internal world, Spider begins to remember his early life, the world he knew before the darkness stole over his mind and robbed him of his faculties. It's a dark world indeed, a world Spider needs to recall if he is to become healthy again.It turns out that Spider's father and his mother had a highly unpleasant relationship. The mother adores her son, fondly nicknaming him &quot;Spider&quot; and doting on him whenever possible. His father Bill, on the other hand, is a cold, aloof man who seems as though he cannot stand the banalities of living with his wife and his son. Spider soon learns his father is up to no good when he sees his dad at the pub associating with a grotesque, bleach blonde prostitute of decidedly icky appearance named Yvonne. One thing leads to another, as adultery often does, and the elder Cleg and the tart consummate their relationship in a particularly sordid way (check out what she throws into the river! Yuck!). Then the madness begins. The prostitute and Spider's father decide to live together as man and wife, a definite problem considering there is already a spouse living under the Cleg roof. Murder is the answer, and murder becomes the solution as Spider's mother dies at the hands of her husband and his new lover. Even worse, Bill and Yvonne want Spider to accept them as his parents, something the boy adamantly refuses to do. Young Dennis decides to take matters into his own hands using his knowledge of making &quot;webs&quot; out of household twine, thus concocting a little surprise for Bill and Yvonne. I'm not going to tell you anything more beyond this point except to say you simply MUST watch this movie. Go out right now and rent it, this second, so you can watch it right away.&quot;Spider&quot; is a film that punishes you for complacency. I should have known better considering my experience with Cronenberg films, but I simply popped this disc in the player, set back, and accepted on face value everything I saw. BIG MISTAKE. Nothing is what it seems in &quot;Spider,&quot; absolutely nothing. Not until the movie neared the explosive revelation at the conclusion of the film did I begin to grasp the reality of the whole thing. Then I howled with surprise and understanding, suddenly remembering all of the clues Cronenberg placed at strategic points throughout the film to help his audience figure it all out. You will probably do the same thing, and that's o.k. since it's what makes the whole thing so much fun. Until you understand what the heck is going on, enjoy the blasted landscapes of London and the phenomenal performances from the stellar cast. Gabriel Byrne plays Bill Cleg like a pro, Miranda Richardson turns in the performance--actually three performances, by the way--of a lifetime. Ralph Fiennes as the disabled Spider really steals the show. We all know he can act because we saw him in &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; but he trumps even that performance here. His acting is Oscar worthy, and that's an understatement.The DVD edition provides plenty of extras explaining nearly everything you would want to know about the movie. There's a lengthy Cronenberg interview where the director explains the difficulties he encountered bringing the film to fruition, a commentary track, a behind the scenes featurette, a trailer, a widescreen picture transfer, and interviews with the cast. Don't even listen to the people who say they hate this film; they simply don't know what they're talking about. &quot;Spider&quot; may well be Cronenberg's best film in his long career, and that's saying something. Brilliant, this one, and well worth owning. Now get out and watch it!",5,An epiphanic experience,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,5749,"['once', 'awhile', 'like', 'watch', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'One', 'thing', 'will', 'always', 'get',

Like much of his most heartfelt work - The Dead Zone, The Fly and Dead Ringers to name a few - Spider is a tragic tale of an alienated and afflicted man. We first meet Spider - beautifully played by Ralph Fiennes - as he takes up residence in a halfway house, a dismal limbo between institution and the real world. One look at him and we know in our bones he will never take that next step. He is a man without a future and whos present is overwhelmed by his past. What unfolds is a story of memory and madness as seen subjectively through the eyes of a shattered personality. Cronenberg's direction is brilliantly assured and deceptively economical. And as good as Fiennes is, and he is good, its Miranda Richardson who delivers the films most impressive performance. She will no doubt be overlooked but certainly deserves a Best Supporting Actress nomination.

498533,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00000F4MA,J from NY,"[2, 2]","If Samuel Beckett himself had written and directed this film, I would not have been surprised.  I would qualify that statement by saying that Beckett probably would not have considered it one of his best.While the film is undeniably powerful, and Fiennes' performance deserves an Oscar, there is a certain malaise (perhaps deliberate) about it which reveals a certain laziness in direction.  ""Spider"" the novel is as distant from ""Spider"" the film as ""The Metamorphosis"" is from ""Kafka"" starring Jeremy Irons.Fiennes' character, Spider, is borderline insane.  He has one foot in reality and one foot in his horrific memories of a sordid, miserable, neglected and misunderstood youth.  The best parts of the film are the scenes in which Spider stands outside the scenes of his past, reciting verbatim the dialogue between his father, mother, and his repulsive mistress.  The ugly reality of insanity is presented here with no romantic embellishment; Spider is deranged, and does not understand the motives behind his own actions.  Awash in misery, the mood of each scene is more or less consistent: tragedy and confusion.  The only parts which even approach humor consist of Spider's entrance to the madhouse.We feel sympathy for Spider, but for practically no one else in the film (except at the end, which reveals the somewhat predictable truth behind the murder of his mother.) Cronenberg tried a little to hard to shove the viewer's face in every nasty form of human behavior: alcoholism, degenerate sexual encounters (between his father and his real or unreal mistress), domestic abuse, etc.  The mood is almost TOO much Beckett.Nonetheless, this is a film that deserves to be watched, if only for some scattered scenes and am ambiance of degeneration I have rarely seen in a film.

In the case of Spider, he heads back into the territory of Dead Ringers, giving us a horror story in which there is no catharsis, no growth, and no hope. It's an astonishingly bleak film.Ralph Fiennes, complete with hair that was apparently an homage to Samuel Beckett (the playwright, not the Quantum Leaper), plays the titular schizophrenic without the bells and whistles someone like, say, Robert DeNiro might have demanded. There's no showiness, no look-at-me-acting scene of yelling or imploring the audience for empathy. Spider is almost completely mute, and when he does talk, he mumbles incoherently.Spider's been released from a mental asylum into a halfway house when the movie begins, in a rundown, vaguely 1980's-looking urban England. His nickname comes from a tendency he's had since childhood to weave elaborate webs out of string and pieces of rope. He's a pattern maker. But he's also schizophrenic. The patterns he makes, the viewer needs to remember, may look sound, but they're inherently flawed.The movie takes us through Spider's reminscences of his childhood, of what seems to be an ogre-ish and unfaithful father and a saint of a mother. How reliable are Spider's memories? Therein lies the mystery of the movie, inevitable as death. This isn't a movie to enjoy in a normal way -- it's horrifying, and there's no attempt to make Spider warm and cuddly, a Hollywood madman. He's very sick. And schizophrenia doesn't spring from some easily understandable childhood trauma: it's a disease, a cancer of the mind.I was exhausted by the end of the movie, and that was from watching it in 20-minute increments over several days. But it was a good exhaustedness. But this isn't Rain Man or A Beautiful Mind. There are no easy life lessons here, no Nobel Prize, no well-meaning brother who learns valuable things from someone with cognitive difficulties, though there are, even for Spider, flashes of clarity amidst the crushing horror.

498537,A15VGFD2Q9NWIO,B00000F4MA,kaream,"[0, 0]","""Spider"" is a film that should be studied at length by any actor or aspiring actor, as well as by any serious filmmaker.  The three main  leads - Ralph Fiennes, Miranda Richardson, and Gabriel Byrnes - give performances of their careers.  David Cronenberg's extremely subtle direction develops from a screenplay written by the original novel's author, and every contributor to the film - photography, lighting, sets and costumes, and music - all come together to make this an incredible experience.This is no Hollywood movie. There are no explosions or chases or gunfights. The development is slow, as some reviewers have complained. There's very definitely a plot, and a surprise ending, but viewers who may feel they have outwitted the film by having guessed the plot and ending in advance are missing the point, because the film is so much more than these. There are layers upon layers of meaning in every visual frame, every line of dialog, every facial expression and body language.The film involves mental instability and confusion, but this is never attributed to schizophrenia as a specific diagnosis. If we think about it, how satisfied can we be that the ending has finally given us the ""reality"" of what has actually occurred? Why do certain characters appear in some scenes but not in others, and how does this relate to the flashbacks we are shown? How do the visuals in the opening credits help set the tone for the film? What is the significance of the jigsaw puzzle, and of the reassembling of the broken window? Do you suppose the window was ever actually reassembled in ""reality""? Near the beginning of the film we learn why the title of the film is ""Spider"", and how this name came to be, but what is the underlying significance of that name, which is not spelled out? How do the family dynamics in the film relate to Freudian theory, and how does the story told by the mother relate of either of these? What degree of reality or misinterpretation can we assign to what we are shown of each of the family members at various times? The role of the father is particularly nuanced and problematic. Can we assume that Lynn Redgrave's character represents a literal reality at all times? And in what way are the end credits deceptive?This DVD comes with a commentary track and several supplementary extras. I strongly recommend that a viewer should simply watch the movie itself first, and mull it over. Then you should go back and watch the entire movie again, this time with the commentary soundtrack, together with the subtitles displaying the dialog, and then proceed to watch each of the interview featurettes provided. Doing this will address many of the questions you may have, or point out observations you may have missed, but will (or should) still leave many aspects of the film unsettled in your mind, to keep thinking about.",5,an actors' film,1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,2851,"['Spider', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'studied', 'length', 'actor', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'serious', 'filmmaker', 'three', 'main', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Gabriel', 'Byrnes', 'give', 'performances', 'careers', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'extremely', 'subtle', 'direction', 'screenplay', 'written', 'original', 'novel', 'author', 'contributor', 'film', 'photography', 'lighting', 'sets', 'costumes', 'music', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'incredible', 'experience.This', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'are', 'explosions', 'chases', 'gunfights', 'development', 'slow', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'very', 'definitely', 'plot', 'surprise', 'ending', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'feel', 'have', 'outwitted', 'film', 'having', 'guessed', 'plot', 'ending', 'advance', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'layers', 'layers', 'meaning', 'visual', 'frame', 'line', 'dialog', 'facial', 'expression', 'body', 'language.The', 'film', 'mental', 'instability', 'confusion', 'never', 'attributed', 'schizophrenia', 'specific', 'diagnosis', 'think', 'how', 'satisfied', 'can', 'be', 'ending', 'finally', 'given', 'reality', 'what', 'actually', 'occurred', 'Why', 'do', 'certain', 'characters', 'appear', 'scenes', 'not', 'others', 'how', 'relate', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'shown', 'How', 'do', 'visuals', 'opening', 'credits', 'help', 'set', 'tone', 'film', 'What', 'significance', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'reassembling', 'broken', 'window', 'Do', 'suppose', 'window', 'was', 'ever', 'actually', 'reassembled', 'reality', 'beginning', 'film', 'learn', 'why', 'title', 'film', 'Spider', 'how', 'name', 'came', 'be', 'what', 'underlying', 'significance', 'name', 'not', 'spelled', 'out', 'How', 'do', 'family', 'dynamics', 'film', 'relate', 'Freudian', 'theory', 'how', 'story', 'told', 'mother', 'relate', 'What', 'degree', 'reality', 'misinterpretation', 'can', 'assign', 'what', 'are', 'shown', 'family', 'members', 'various', 'times', 'role', 'father', 'particularly', 'nuanced', 'problematic', 'Can', 'assume', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'character', 'literal', 'reality', 'times', 'what', 'way', 'are', 'end', 'deceptive', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'several', 'supplementary', 'extras', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'viewer', 'should', 'simply', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'mull', 'over', 'Then', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'entire', 'movie', 'again', 'time', 'commentary', 'soundtrack', 'together', 'subtitles', 'displaying', 'dialog', 'then', 'proceed', 'watch', 'interview', 'provided', 'Doing', 'will', 'address', 'many', 'questions', 'may', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'observations', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'will', 'should', 'still', 'leave', 'many', 'aspects', 'film', 'unsettled', 'mind', 'keep', 'thinking']",Spider

I would echo M. J. Walters (dargelos) review below, but with one difference. I took it that the obscene cackling whores the boy first encounters on being sent to fetch his father home from the pub were real. It was a combination of the boy's identification of their gross and appalling behaviour as the sum of female sexuality together with the  realisation that his mother was also a sexual being that upset the balance of his mind with such disturbung consequences.As for Ralph Fiennes performance, I can never forget the words put into Kate Winslett's mouth, via Ricky Gervias' 'Extras', that 'The quickest way to win an Oscar is to play a 'mental''. He did little more here than stagger around looking appalled, which most of us have done on a Saturday night before now. Gabriel Byrne's role was almost incidental as the father, except in that he was the obvious target and trigger of the mother's sexuality, but his working class London accent was pitch perfect.

498541,A1WTYALNQNQG99,B00000F4MA,Larry L. Looney,"[32, 34]","...and that takes absolutely NOTHING away from the stunning contributions from everyone involved in this project.  As soon as I read Patrick McGrath's incredible novel a few years ago, I knew I had discovered something wonderfully unique - then I read that there were plans for a film, with McGrath writing the screenplay - and when the pieces began to fall into place (Ralph Fiennes in the title role, along with Miranda Richardson and Lynn Redgrave, with David Cronenberg directing) I knew that the film would be something very special indeed.  I was almost afraid to see it when it appeared in theatres (delayed for months in the US after its European release, evidently to keep it from being confused with SPIDER-MAN) - I feared that I had built up my expectations to a degree that they could not be fulfilled.  I needn't have worried - the film floored me completely, from the performances by the great actors named above, to Cronenberg's masterful direction, to the perfect set design, Howard Shore's dead-on score, everything.  This is as perfect an adaptation as a film could be.  I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out, so I could view the film and have the ability to stop it and run it back in order to absorb all of its nuances.It's also a difficult review to write - the plot twists are so delicious, and so perfectly rendered in the film, but to reveal too much about them would spoil it for any potential viewers.  I'll try my best not to do that - I don't want to deprive anyone of the full effect.  I have to agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer below when he states that `Hitchcock would have killed' to direct this story, and that it quite possibly surpasses anything that Hitchcock ever did (how many contemporary films could you say THAT about, and mean it...?).According to Cronenberg's commentary on the DVD, when the script was sent to him, Ralph Fiennes had already decided that he wanted to play the part.  Cronenberg stated `...two pages into the script, I knew that no one else could do it'.  Plagued with financing difficulties - the director said that the financing actually had to be acquired a second time, after some sources backed out - it's a wonder the film was made at all.  The cast and the director deferred their salaries, making it possible - and turning the project into a true labor of love.  We owe them a debt of gratitude for their dedication and sacrifice.`Spider' is Dennis Cleg - a man just released from a mental asylum to live in a halfway house in London's East End, very near his childhood neighborhood.  Fiennes slips into the role completely - he pulls every ounce of the character's fiber out of the script, and added some touches of his own (the constant muttering was his idea) to round it out perfectly.  Spider had a troubled childhood - as is evident from the memories that haunt him.  The question is, which ones are real and which ones are manufactured...?  As the story progresses, the web gets more and more intricate.  Cronenberg films Spider in various environments - the halfway house day room, as well as his private room;  on the streets in his neighborhood;  in a local caf&eacute;, as well as the pub his dad used to frequent.  All of these places trigger memories in him. He sees the characters from his past - his dad and mum, the `cheap tart' Yvonne - appear before him as if it were yesterday again.  We see the adult Spider looking in through the kitchen window of his boyhood home, watching his mum and dad and himself as a child having dinner.  He eavesdrops on their conversations, mumbling lines from each character before they speak them.  Each place that he goes caused more doors of his memory to open - he tries desperately to put the pieces together, and it's a painful struggle, very difficult to watch.I can't stress enough how mesmerizing Ralph Fiennes is in this role - watching him, it's very easy to completely forget that it's an actor playing a part. Miranda Richardson is stunning in multiple roles - she plays Spider's mum, as well as the tart Yvonne...and she makes an appearance, briefly, as a third character (watch for it!).  Lynn Redgrave has long been admired as a masterful actor - she brings the perfect combination of authority and coldness to her portrayal of Mrs Wilkinson, with a dash of cruelty and seductiveness thrown in.  The subtleties she invokes are amazing.  Gabriel Byrne does a very nice job indeed in a difficult role as Spider's dad - he has to portray his character both as he is and as he is imagined and remembered, and he does it with a naturalness that betrays the daunting task.  Bradley Hall, the young actor who portrays Spider as a child, combines loneliness, vulnerability, desperation, fear and an aching need to understand what is going on in his family and his world - amazing work from one so young.  John Neville is very effective as Spider's fellow halfway house dweller Terrence - `...we're not to be trusted, are we, Terrence...?' muses Mrs Wilkinson when she introduces the two.  Terrence speaks a line that is very evocative of the isolation and pain felt by victims of schizophrenia, when he tells Spider, `...it's a loud world.'I can't say enough about this incredible film - but I know I don't want to inadvertently give too much away, and I know I'm approaching my word-count limit.  Pass it by at your peril - the DVD is beautifully rendered, with great bonus material - but should you ever get the chance, see this one on the big screen.  It wasn't a box-office smash - and the public once again has ignored a masterpiece.",5,"WITHOUT A DOUBT, CRONENBERG'S MASTERPIECE...",1064361600,"09 24, 2003",2003,5575,"['absolutely', 'NOTHING',

Both my wife &amp; I did not understand what happened.  While I understand the critical embrace that many give the film, a movie that must be explained to be understood is not successful.It's always difficult to have a protagonist who is mentally ill.  A story like Spider would do better where there are characters like in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; or &quot;Iris&quot; through whom the audience gains stability in understanding the material.  Instead, while there is a full exploration of the character by Ralph Fiennes' excellent job of acting, we didn't understand whether he really murdered his mother or whether his father had.  Miranda Richardson's performance is incredible.  I really had no clue that Mrs. Cleg and Yvonne the bargirl were played by the same person.  They seemed to be two completely separate individuals to me.  Young Bradley Hall seemed the sanest of all the characters to me, enduring quite a bit from his father played by Gabriel Byrne.  Lynn Redgrave did a great job as Mrs. Wilkinson, but I had no clue why Yvonne suddenly was seen as Mrs. Wilkinson.The one aspect of the film that I did appreciate was the cinematography.

498545,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00000F4MA,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 7]","This 2002 film stars Ralph Fiennes as man who has just been released from a mental institution after many years.  He obviously still has mental illness, but is probably not considered a threat, and so he's sent to a dreary halfway house run by Lynn Redgrave.  His isolation from the world is clear as he wanders around the streets of London and partial memories come back to haunt him. The audience actually has a chance to get inside his mind and it's never clear as to what is real and what isn't.On one of his wanderings, he looks inside a house and sees a mother and child.  Soon we understand that this family is his interpretation of his own world as a child.  Ten-year old Bradley Hall plays the young boy and the role calls for him to live in a world that seems slightly askew.  Miranda Richardson is cast as the mother as well as two other different roles, and she does such a good job that I thought there were actually three different actresses.  It wasn't until I saw the special features on the DVD that I realized what was going on.As the story unfolds we see the boy witnessing his father, played by Gabriel Bryne, romancing both the mother and a local woman he meets in a bar.  There's a murder.  And we're not exactly sure what happened because the details just don't seem real.  It takes a while for us to realize that this is because the director, David Cronenberg, in his adaptation of a novel by Patrick McGrath, actually brings us inside the mind of this poor tortured man.It's all very abstract and hard to follow and I found myself bored and impatient.  But I'm glad I sat through the film to the end and saw the special features on the DVD.  It helped make sense of a very complex and expressionistic film that delves deep within the human psyche and gives us a glimpse into the dark world of the mentally ill.This is not a film for everyone.  It is disturbing on many levels.  It's also hard to understand.  However, it is so brilliantly done that I do not hesitate in giving it a high recommendation, especially for certain kinds of film buffs who can appreciate an abstract film and not care if it leaves a sad resonance.",5,A glimpse into the dark world of the mentally ill,1060992000,"08 16, 2003",2003,2149,"['2002', 'film', 'stars', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'mental', 'institution', 'many', 'years', 'obviously', 'still', 'mental', 'illness', 'probably', 'not', 'considered', 'threat', 'so', 'sent', 'dreary', 'halfway', 'house', 'run', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'isolation', 'world', 'clear', 'streets', 'London', 'partial', 'memories', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'audience', 'actually', 'chance', 'get', 'mind', 'never', 'clear', 'what', 'real', 'what', ""isn't.On"", 'one', 'wanderings', 'house', 'mother', 'child', 'Soon', 'understand', 'family', 'interpretation', 'own', 'world', 'child', 'Ten-year', 'old', 'Bradley', 'Hall', 'young', 'boy', 'role', 'live', 'world', 'slightly', 'askew', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'cast', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'other', 'different', 'roles', 'good', 'job', 'thought', 'were', 'actually', 'three', 'different', 'actresses', 'was', ""n't"", 'saw', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'realized', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'story', 'see', 'boy', 'witnessing', 'father', 'played', 'Gabriel', 'Bryne', 'romancing', 'mother', 'local', 'woman', 'bar', 'murder', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'happened', 'details', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'while', 'realize', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Patrick', 'McGrath', 'actually', 'mind', 'poor', 'tortured', 'man.It', 'very', 'abstract', 'hard', 'follow', 'found', 'bored', 'impatient', ""'m"", 'glad', 'sat', 'film', 'end', 'saw', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'helped', 'make', 'sense', 'very', 'complex', 'expressionistic', 'film', 'deep', 'human', 'psyche', 'glimpse', 'dark', 'world', 'mentally', 'ill.This', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'disturbing', 'many', 'levels', 'also', 'hard', 'understand', 'However', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'giving', 'high', 'recommendation', 'especially', 'certain', 'kinds', 'film', 'buffs', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'abstract', 'film', 'not', 'care', 'sad', 'resonance']",Spider
498546,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00000F4MA,"Maine Writer ""David""","[6, 8]","I wasn't sure what to make of Spider before I saw it, and, frankly, I feel the same way afterwards.  Spider is an attempt to bring the audience into the mind of a mentally disturbed man, Spider, who has just been released--prematurely it would seem--from a mental institution, and finds himself drifting about between a halfway house and the familiar places from his childhood.  Ralph Fiennes' nuanced, if mumbly, performance as Spider interested me, but the slow, langorous pace was difficult to deal with.  We begin witnessing Spider's childhood and the events that may, or may not, have precipitated his madness.And he is mad, scribbling nonsense hieroglyphics in a tattered notebook, mumbling about this or that, assembling a jigsaw puzzle, and then trashing it, with strange intensity, wearing eight or nine shirts simultaneously, wrapping old newspaper and twine around his torso--you get the picture.But the clever conceit of Spider is trying to understand what is true, and what is not, about Spider's childhood recollections.  Did witnessing a violent event warp his mind?  Or was it a gas leak from the stove?  Or was it guilt over an extraordinary crime?  Was it the prostitute who flashes her breast at the quiet, friendless little boy?  Or was he just born that way?  The truth slowly--and I mean slowly--unravels, until we realize the depths of Spider's schizophrenia, and perhaps understand the disease just a little more than when the movie started--what seemed like hours and hours and hours ago.This is a brave attempt at insight, and it succeeds on some levels.  Certainly, it seems driven by artistic vision, not box office success, and that, alone, is about as much nobility as we expect from film.

498548,A258YDD6553JA2,B00000F4MA,Mary F. Sibley,"[4, 4]","From the opening frames of the credits, the church hymn, the Rorschach prints and the measured and precise pacing of them, we are entering a world of a severely disengaged man, who has had the spectre of schizophrenia as his constant companion, both in his waking and sleeping hours. The mumblings and rememberances of Dennis Clegg (Ralph Fiennes) combine to make for a journey down Memory Lane that is unlike any that rational, thinking people would care to take, let alone inhabit and from which there is very little chance of escape.Fiennes spends the length of the film attempting to piece together bits and pieces of times past in his childhood, that may or may not have happened. The prize in this herculanean effort is not so much to discover the unseemly goings on of his father, but rather seeking a discourse into the inner workings of Clegg's mind and what it potentially holds and abandons at will.Dennis Clegg has been released into the care of a matron (Lynn Redgrave) in a halfway house in a decaying, dying section of London, that has become the home, heart and soul for others of his ilk; the mentally disabled, discharged from the asylum, but not quite ready for habitation in the outside world at large. His lodgings represent the underbelly of a netherworld that caters to no one and where rehabilitation is a foreign word, absent from the vocabulary of those in charge.Redgrave plays Mrs. Wilkinson, the spawn of Nurse Ratchet, with a demeanor as cold as the grave and as uncaring as any you are likely to see. Hers is a job, nothing more, nothing less; an automaton in the flesh. John Neville (teamed again with Fiennes. He was in Sunshine.) as Terrance, another resident of the house, has etched a character who sums up the medicated and serene patient seen as a non-threat to the establishment, but who attempts to warn Clegg of the queenly attitudes of Wilkinson and the powers she holds. This British character actor's small part in this film is a gem deserving of recognition.Every movement that Clegg makes is guaranteed to bear witness to a recollection and to focus on events as perceived in his ever crumbling mind. Once his journey into neverland begins, we are brought along ever so slowly so that we capture these moments precisely and without seeing error. We learn that his mother, as played by Miranda Richardson, had nicknamed him Spider and it is through his newly gained name that his mannerisms take on the skin of the animal. Each newly remembered facet of his world is honed on the impressions of a spider web -- the string, brokenglass, the jigsaw puzzle, the string game he plays at the kitchen table -- spiraling and spinning the child and the man into its deadly web and further from reality as we know it.Richardson portrays three multi-faceted characters in this film, three spirits, and with each one she sheds a skin and grows another, entirely different in bearing and manner. It is a tour de force performance. Gabriel Bryne as Bill Clegg is dark and daunting, shown as a family man bored and tired with the mundance existance that is his life. Or is he?The performance of Bradley Hall as the young Spider is eerie and precisely on the money. You can feel a kindred spirit between his child Spider and the adult that he is to become in Ralph Fiennes.The best has been saved for last and that honour belongs to Ralph Fiennes. His Spider is haunted and haunting, gritty and realistic. This crumbling vestige of a man has been finely honed and not once did I think that I was watching a performance but rather as true a representation of a schizophrenic as one is able to command. It is not a glamour role or a safe role, not a trace of pretty boy about it and thank god, none attempting to project itself from the proceedings! Fiennes, who is known for the research he puts into his roles, has scored all aces with this one.Another added plus is that Hollywood has not managed to ruin a good thing -- a film that truly makes one THINK about what they have just seen. I cannot help but put another role as a schizophrenic into play -- that of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind. When you see these two films and attempt to add the similarities, about the only one that comes to mind IS the fact that schizophrenics are being represented and nothing more. Fiennes has left, for all intents and purposes, Crowe's portrayal in the dust, and if Hollywood has any guts come Oscar nomination time, they will credit a true acting triumph, rather than the orchestrated ones that usually win because of huge studio mounted pushes. Spider is the little film that could, did and should.Spider is not an easy film to watch, but then seeing madness never is. There are those who will be turned off by it, or perhaps momentarily subjected to moments of quiet. Then again, others will cheer a peformance that is worthy of the accolade, a job very well done indeed! BRAVO! Cronenberg, as director, has launched a film that is as subdued and unassuming as a breath of air as it brushes past a cheek. The hollow streets, the absence of crowds and the delicate renderings of cast and crew alike, have conveyed a dream or as some would insist, a nightmare andforsaken a Hollywood beginning, middle and end.I sincerely hope that Spider is not lost in the shuffle of films that will spill forth over the course of the spring, or be considered as &quot;too arthouse&quot; to warrant consideration by other than those who know absolute talent when it is put in front of them. This film is not &quot;entertainment&quot; per se, and that would be the wrong word to use. Rather, eye opening and thought provoking would be a more apt description. It's a step on the edge of the abyss and the eventual and catastrophic conclusion that must become Spider's reality.It is minimalist and daring and I can't say strongly enough how much this ensemble cast has brought forth for our inspection. See this film and be amazed at it in all its consummate glory!",5,"Come Into My Parlour, Said The Spider To The Fly",1074643200,"01 21, 2004",2004,5972,"['opening', 'frames', 'credits', 'church',

I have read numerous fictional books about mental illness (I Never Promised You a Rose Garden; One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest; etc.) and seen some movies about the subject (A Beautiful Mind; Fight Club; etc) but I believe that this movie was the worst take on the theme that I have ever seen.Ralf Fiennes plays a mentally disturbed man nicknamed ""Spider,"" whose childhood is reveled through flashbacks.  The movie moves very slowly and Fiennes' acting is not impressive: he just walks around and mumbers for most of the movie.  There is even a scene where, for no reason, he takes off his clothes and covers himself with curtains or something.  I have no idea why this was in the movie.The flashback scenes deal mostly with Spider's father who in one scene kills his mother and takes up with another woman.  Supposively, these events were not what really happened, but only the distorted views from Spider's mental illness, but this concept isn't convincing and is only clear up briefly at the end of the movie.  So basically, through the whole movie, spider's father just seems like a terrible person and terrible human being in general which makes this one of the most depressing movies that I have ever seen.This movie is really a downer that will likely disturb you for a few days after watching it.  It isn't an introspective look into mental illness; it is just a cheap, dark, artsy-fartsy movie.

And the job they do is utterly fascinating.The film is deliberately-paced (read: slow), which is likely to put off some viewers, but Cronenberg allows the characters to find themselves in the time allotted; remember, this is a character study more than it is a plot-driven mystery. Spider spends his time trying to solve the mystery of his past, yes, but that's incidental to him trying to solve the mystery of himself. As the film begins, Spider (the incredible Ralph Fiennes in the role of his career) has just been released from the asylum and sent to a halfway house overseen by a surprisingly likable harridan named Mrs. Wilkinson (Lynn Redgrave). Spider is a schizophrenic, and much of the buzz surrounding the film dealt with how well the filmmakers and Fiennes portrayed the schizophrenic mindset. Don't be looking for Sam Jackson's wonderful performance in The Caveman's Valentine here, though; Spider is almost the diametric opposite of Romulus Ledbetter; obsessively inner-directed, muttering to himself rather than shouting at the neighbors, longing for human companionship (which he finds in a couple of fellow halfway house inmates, Terence [John Neville] and Freddy [Gary Reinieke]) but unsure what to do with it when he gets it. He is far more fascinated with scenes of his early life that he, and we, see regularly throughout the film as he tries to piece together the reason he originally went insane.The present-day scenes are strong, but the past scenes are even stronger. Gabriel Byrne and Miranda Richardson play Spider's mother and father, and both balance a very delicate line between playing the ogre and the saint Spider sees and playing the confused parents of a child who is obviously already showing signs of mental disturbance that (we assume) they truly are. Both have done some excellent work in their time, but, like Fiennes, they have truly outdone themselves in these roles. As Spider gets closer and closer to figuring out the end of the story, both as he sees it and as (we assume, again) it really happened, both Byrne and Richardson's characters change subtly and get closer to (what we perceive as) reality.The extra DVD materials are fascinating; Cronenberg's interviews about the filming techniques and the reasoning behind some of the shots brought the ideas behind them out even more, lending an even more impressive weight to the film itself.Highly recommended on all counts. **** 1/2",4,A departure for Cronenberg.,1060560000,"08 11, 2003",2003,2713,"['Spider', 'David', 'Cronenberg', '2002', 'Wow.David', 'Cronenberg', 'away', 'obsession', 'biomechanics', 'teams', 'up', 'novelist/screenwriter', 'Patrick', 'McGrath', 'Grotesque', 'forthcoming', 'Asylum', 'stable', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'bring', 'McGrath', 'chilling', 'novel', 'Spider', 'screen', 'job', 'do', 'utterly', 'fascinating.The', 'film', 'deliberately-paced', 'read', 'slow', 'likely', 'put', 'off', 'viewers', 'Cronenberg', 'characters', 'find', 'time', 'allotted', 'remember', 'character', 'study', 'more', 'plot-driven', 'mystery', 'Spider', 'time', 'trying', 'solve', 'mystery', 'past', 'yes', 'incidental', 'trying', 'solve', 'mystery', 'film', 'Spider', 'incredible', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'role', 'career', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'asylum', 'sent', 'halfway', 'house', 'overseen', 'surprisingly', 'likable', 'harridan', 'named', 'Mrs.', 'Wilkinson', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Spider', 'schizophrenic', 'much', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'film', 'dealt', 'how', 'well', 'filmmakers', 'Fiennes', 'portrayed', 'schizophrenic', 'mindset', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'looking', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Caveman', 'Valentine', 'here', 'Spider', 'almost', 'diametric', 'opposite', 'Romulus', 'Ledbetter', 'obsessively', 'inner-directed', 'muttering', 'rather', 'shouting', 'neighbors', 'longing', 'human', 'companionship', 'couple', 'fellow', 'halfway', 'house', 'Terence', '[', 'John', 'Neville', ']', 'Freddy', '[', 'Gary', 'Reinieke', ']', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'far', 'more', 'fascinated', 'scenes', 'early', 'life', 'see', 'regularly', 'film', 'piece', 'together', 'reason', 'originally', 'went', 'insane.The', 'present-day', 'scenes', 'are', 'strong', 'past', 'scenes', 'are', 'even', 'stronger', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'play', 'Spider', 'mother', 'father', 'balance', 'very', 'delicate', 'line', 'playing', 'ogre', 'saint', 'Spider', 'sees', 'playing', 'confused', 'parents', 'child', 'who', 'obviously', 'already', 'showing', 'signs', 'mental', 'disturbance', 'assume', 'truly', 'are', 'have', 'done', 'excellent', 'work', 'time', 'Fiennes', 'have', 'truly', 'outdone', 'roles', 'Spider', 'closer', 'closer', 'figuring', 'out', 'end', 'story', 'assume', 'again', 'really', 'happened', 'Byrne', 'Richardson', 'characters', 'change', 'subtly', 'get', 'closer', 'what', 'perceive', 'reality.The', 'extra', 'DVD', 'materials', 'are', 'fascinating', 'Cronenberg', 'interviews', 'filming', 'techniques', 'reasoning', 'shots', 'brought', 'ideas', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'lending', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'weight', 'film', 'itself.Highly', 'recommended', 'counts', '1/2']",Spider

Crawford,"[1, 1]","Rather than his usual niche market of perversity and naked violence, Cronenberg has made an excellent arthouse film about the struggle of a disturbed man who returns home.  Fiennes is Mr. Cleg, a schizophrenic man who has left a mental asylum for the first time since his childhood.  Checking into a halfway house in his old neighborhood, run by a tough old matron, he goes about exploring his childhood haunts, mixing past and present in painful recollections of some kind of a trauma.  This technique is extremely effective in showing not just the disarray of his mind, but also his slippery hold on reality.The story that emerges has meaning, i.e. his illness is not merely a ""chemical imbalance"" but linked to experience.  As it unfolds, he portrays his family:  a loving mother, a cold and apparently abusive father, whose relationship with a local hooker disrupts their home.  All the while, Cleg is writing down his ideas in code in a tiny notebook that he hides.  As the process progresses, the viewer can see how he is fighting to see the truth, in spite of the lies he has weaved around himself like the webs that obsess him.  It is remarkable how well each piece fits as in a puzzle.  When it emerges, the truth is far worse than what he imagined (which I won't give away).Fiennes is amazing in the role.  He has to show all the inner turmoil by his gestures and posture, which exude the broken state of his self and mind.

498561,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00000F4MA,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 6]","The creepy psychological thriller, ""Spider,"" is difficult and challenging even for a David Cronenberg film.  It is also immensely rewarding.The film starts off slowly, but like the spider of the title, it spins a web that draws us into the center of its world and never lets us out.  Ralph Fiennes delivers a bravura performance in the largely nonverbal role of a mentally disturbed man who, upon his discharge from an asylum, takes up residence in a drab halfway house in London.  As Fiennes shuffles, mumbles and twitches his way about the house and around the neighborhood, a fascinating Oedipal drama emerges.  Throughout the course of the story, Spider, the adult, begins to intrude more and more into the past as he watches unobserved the events he believes occurred in his childhood.  As a boy, he obviously adored and worshiped his mother (Miranda Richardson), so much so that, as a grownup, he begins to imagine himself present at events that depict his father's supposed infidelities (and worse), clearly hoping that, by doing this, Spider can eliminate his father either as a rival or, at best, as an agent of further defilement.  In order to continue seeing his mother as sacred, the young Spider finds a unique, but ultimately fatal method of ""objectifying"" her and the feelings he has for her (a method that fits perfectly into the old Madonna syndrome).  It is an act that will have fatal consequences for the family unit.What makes all this so absorbing is the way in which Cronenberg and scenarist Patrick McGrath delve into the subconscious madness of the main character.  For large stretches of the film we literally have no idea if what we are seeing in the past actually happened or whether it is all the product of a deeply disturbed mind.  Only towards the end do all the pieces fall into place, revealing the ""truth"" beneath the surface of this highly disturbing tale.  ""Spider"" is a thriller in the richest sense of the term because it builds its suspense gradually and subtly, fully aware that the greatest threats come from our own distorted views of reality. Against such madness, how can any of us be safe?Cronenberg has provided a somber, stark environment in which to unfold his drama.  The drab colors, sterile settings, somber music and pervasive spider imagery all contribute to the foreboding atmosphere of the piece.  As Spider, Fiennes is a revelation, conveying the disturbed nature of the character through indirection and understatement, never going over the top in his portrayal of a truly insane man, making him all the more convincing and chilling.  Miranda Richardson (in a triple role), Gabriel Byrne, Lynn Redgrave, John Neville and young Bradley Hall all contribute mightily to the success of the work.My biggest fear is that many people will tune out this film early on because of its admittedly slow pacing in the first half.

498562,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B00000F4MA,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[31, 31]","This movie is a strange mood piece with a tremendous performance by Ralph Fiennes as a man who's been released from a mental institution and has returned to the London neighborhood where he grew up. The nature of his illness is deliberately unclear. We simply watch as familiar surroundings trigger disturbing memories of his boyhood, and through them we slowly piece together his story.The mood is set by a long, long tracking shot as the movie begins, as passengers disembark from a train in a large London terminal. The camera seems to be searching through this throng for someone in particular, and after what seems like an eternity, Fiennes as Spider emerges painfully and awkwardly onto the platform with a beat-up suitcase.  And we are plunged from a scene of everyday activity into his world, which is far, far removed from the everyday and ordinary.There's a twilight-zone kind of ambiance in the movie, as the camera shows us interiors and exteriors that are typically empty of furnishings and people. Street scenes, for instance, have no passing traffic, no pedestrians, not even cars parked at curbs. The lighting is often like stage lighting, coming from unexpected sources and providing an eerie flatness. The soundtrack alternates between strange rumbling noises, a small group of strings experimenting with mournful dissonance, and a lovely old-fashioned ballad that Spider remembers from childhood.The supporting actors are wonderful, as they waver in our perception between what their characters really are and how they appear to Spider. Miranda Richardson has the task of playing three different characters, each as Spider sees them. Gabriel Byrne and Lynne Redgrave in brief scenes give richly nuanced performances. As with many indie movies, the commentary and other features on the DVD provide further interesting insights.This is not a movie for an audience looking for entertainment. It is a psychological study and something of a mystery, as we make what sense we can of what the movie slowly reveals of its central character. I recommend it to anyone fascinated by the darker sides of the human psyche, the puzzle of mental illness, and the strange ways that the everyday world can be transformed by a troubled and isolated point of view.",5,A disturbing and fascinating journey into mental illness,1061510400,"08 22, 2003",2003,2264,"['movie', 'strange', 'mood', 'piece', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'released', 'mental', 'institution', 'returned', 'London', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'nature', 'illness', 'deliberately', 'unclear', 'simply', 'watch', 'familiar', 'surroundings', 'trigger', 'disturbing', 'memories', 'boyhood', 'slowly', 'piece', 'together', 'story.The', 'mood', 'set', 'long', 'long', 'tracking', 'shot', 'movie', 'passengers', 'disembark', 'train', 'large', 'London', 'terminal', 'camera', 'be', 'searching', 'throng', 'someone', 'particular', 'what', 'eternity', 'Fiennes', 'Spider', 'painfully', 'awkwardly', 'platform', 'beat-up', 'suitcase', 'are', 'plunged', 'scene', 'everyday', 'activity', 'world', 'far', 'far', 'removed', 'everyday', 'twilight-zone', 'kind', 'ambiance', 'movie', 'camera', 'interiors', 'exteriors', 'are', 'typically', 'empty', 'furnishings', 'people', 'Street', 'scenes', 'instance', 'have', 'passing', 'traffic', 'pedestrians', 'not', 'even', 'cars', 'parked', 'curbs', 'lighting', 'often', 'like', 'stage', 'lighting', 'coming', 'unexpected', 'sources', 'providing', 'eerie', 'flatness', 'soundtrack', 'strange', 'rumbling', 'noises', 'small', 'group', 'strings', 'experimenting', 'mournful', 'dissonance', 'lovely', 'old-fashioned', 'ballad', 'Spider', 'remembers', 'childhood.The', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'waver', 'perception', 'what', 'characters', 'really', 'are', 'how', 'appear', 'Spider', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'task', 'playing', 'three', 'different', 'characters', 'Spider', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Lynne', 'Redgrave', 'brief', 'scenes', 'give', 'richly', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'many', 'indie', 'movies', 'commentary', 'other', 'features', 'DVD', 'provide', 'further', 'interesting', 'insights.This', 'not', 'movie', 'audience', 'looking', 'entertainment', 'psychological', 'study', 'something', 'mystery', 'make', 'what', 'sense', 'can', 'what', 'movie', 'slowly', 'reveals', 'central', 'character', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'fascinated', 'darker', 'sides', 'human', 'psyche', 'puzzle', 'mental', 'illness', 'strange', 'ways', 'everyday', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'transformed', 'troubled', 'isolated', 'point', 'view']",Spider

He's made another low-budget, sure-to-bomb-at-the-box-office movie that he just HAD to make. His career suffers a little, but the audience benefits.With a great script (by the author of the novel) and Ralph Fiennes already attached to it, Cronenberg couldn't say no. Fiennes is amazing, playing what turns out to be a pantomime role --- he hardly speaks. He conveys everything through gestures, mumbling, and his eyes. The rest of the cast is just as good.The pace might put you off, but you can't really judge this film until you've seen it twice. It's subtle movie. The final moments bring it all together in a way that makes the second viewing much more satisfying.The Cronenberg audio track is also very good. The director explains the movie as it goes along. This would be a bad idea if the story was simple, but it isn't. He explains, for example, that he didn't want this to be a clinical examination of schizophrenia, so he didn't bother to get every detail of that particular mental disorder correct. Once you take the movie for what it is --- concise, light on special effects, and impressionistic --- it turns into a very rewarding experience.Even the length is impressive. Rather than take the bloated approach of a Oscar-ready Hollywood &quot;mentally ill guy&quot; movie, he sticks to his horror-film roots and keeps it down to an hour and a half.The only real weakness is the lack of small touches, the memorable moments that turn a good movie into a great one. The &quot;quickie in the tunnel,&quot; for example, is unforgettable.

498565,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00000F4MA,Steven Reynolds,"[2, 6]","Recently released from a mental institution, Dennis 'Spider' Cleg is assigned to a halfway house beside an ominous-looking gasworks in London's East End. He spends the first twenty minutes of the film muttering incomprehensibly and scribbling in no known language in his notebook. Why was he committed? Why has he been released? What will he do now? We soon discover we aren't going to be told these things - we're going to be shown. As Spider revisits the sites of his early childhood, memories of the past and experiences of the present dramatically merge, and it becomes clear that he's once again losing his mind. ""Spider"" is interesting mainly for its artful attempts, in both production and performance, to externalize the experience of schizophrenia. Ralph Fiennes gives a daring performance in the lead role, and Miranda Richardson is wonderful playing two very different characters who are conflated in the young Spider's mind. Cronenberg's London is appropriately frightening - deserted, mysterious and sinister - and Peter Suschitzky's thoughtful camerawork makes a convincing tilt at representing a mind on the brink of insanity. As other reviewers have noted, Cronenberg's strategy here is to present a shifting ""reality"" that's deliberately unreliable, until the veracity of everything is called into question. It's an interesting cinematic experiment. Ultimately, though, it's this very unreliability that undermines ""Spider"" as a piece of storytelling. When none of the evidence can be trusted, most of the pleasures associated with watching a mystery story unfold - anticipation, suspicion, suspense and surprise - simply fade away. It gets dull. Very dull. And there's little in the way of action or drama to lift the pace. Overall, ""Spider"" is a technically compelling but not quite engaging film. If you're interested in filmmaking, adaptation, unreliable narrative, or the way in which all aspects of a film's realization can be interestingly deployed in pursuit of a single theme, then you'll probably find ""Spider"" an absorbing night's viewing and a film you'll want to own.

Cronenburg has honed his art with a Beckettian austerity,bleak interiors,drab colours,no longer ram-raiding the subconscious,he uncovers and disentangles the psychology of a 'dead soul' beneath layers of paranoid schizophrenia,unravelling the disconnected psyche,spaced out for years on solitary musings in the hinterland of his mind.This has the clarity and sombreness of a masterpiece.Cronenburg's best film yet.",5,Hanging from the edge of the web,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,3505,"['rainy', 'grim', 'grey', 'streets', 'East', 'London', 'dominated', 'Gasometers', 'streets', 'bricked-up', 'windows', 'doorways', 'unpeopled.Set', 'late', '50s', 'post-war', 'desolation.Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Dennis', 'Clegg', 'inching', 'way', 'slowly', 'train', 'half-way', 'house', 'mentally', 'ill', 'hospital', 'community', 'run', 'Mrs.Wilkinson', 'Lynne', 'Redgrave', 'formidable', 'matriarch', 'fear.He', 'mumbles', 'hesitatingly.John', 'Neville', 'loquacious', 'grandiose', 'Terence', 'humour', 'institutionalised', 'who', 'Dickensian', 'ramshackle', 'home.Clegg', 'been', 'away', 'mental', 'institution', 'years.He', 'now', 'returning', 'explore', 'memories', 'delusions', 'paranoid', 'thoughts', 'fears', 'trauma', 'schizophrenic', 'past.His', 'notebook', 'used', 'record', 'journey', 'time', 'trauma.Jig-saw', 'pieces', 'filled', 'conjecture.Isolated', 'lonely', 'friends', 'dispel', 'webby', 'thoughts.As', 'sights', 'smells', 'dank', 'landscape', 'permeate', 'fractured', 'consciousness', 'Spider', 'recall', 'turbulent', 'boyhood', 'only', 'child', 'abusive', 'plumber', 'Byrne', 'wife', 'Richardson', '.He', 'outer', 'environment', 'caf', 'eacute', 'pubs', 'canal', 'seats', 'environment', 'grew', 'up', 'silk', 'memories.Clegg', 'deep', 'love', 'mother', 'who', 'archetype', 'women', 'him.He', 'was', 'closer', 'father.He', 'father', 'Byrne', 'Bill', 'killed', 'mother', 'took', 'up', 'tart.It', 'mother', 'Richardson', 'are', 'neglected', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'father.His', 'mother', 'fondly', 'called', 'Spider', 'love', 'cat', 'cradles', 'spider', 'webs.She', 'mixed', 'up', 'head', 'Yvonne', 'tart', 'also', 'played', 'Richardson', 'who', 'Bill', 'love', 'canal', 'allotment.He', 'killing', 'mother', 'Bill.Yvonne', 'live', 'usurping', 'mother', 'role.Again', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'delusion', 'are', 'hard', 'fathom.In', 'present', 'Yvonne', 'soon', 'Mrs.Wilkinson', 'role', 'half-way', 'house.He', 'steals', 'room', 'planning', 'kill', 'her.When', 'see', 'Redgrave', 'Mrs.Wilkinson.We', 'also', 'see', 'way', 'Spider', 'junior', 'rigs', 'string', 'up', 'gas', 'supply', 'on.The', 'tart', 'killed', 'father', 'body', 'street', 'crying', 'Spider', 'mother', 'protagonist', 'narrative', 'truth', 'illusion', 'intertwine.The', 'psychic', 'events', 'subjectivity', 'unreliable', 'narrator', 'drive', 'film', 'slowly', 'forward', 'memories', 'distorted', 'perception.Hanging', 'fragile', 'precipice', 'Spider', 'creation', 'film', 'images', 'represent', 'beliefs', 'what', 'happened', 'conceal', 'what', 'really', 'happened.As', 'Spider', 'deeper', 'past', 'hallucinations', 'escalate.Fiennes', 'portrayal', 'best', 'ever', 'stripping', 'away', 'rhetoric', 'acting', 'become', 'seemingly', 'real', 'schizophrenic.The', 'cinematography', '1st', 'rate', 'showing', 'reductive', 'realistic', 'impoverished', 'environment.The', 'music', 'too', 'beautifully', 'selected.Witness', 'how', 'Silent', 'Night', 'captures', 'fled', 'tenderness', 'Spider', 'mother.Richardson', 'truly', 'magnificent', '3', 'roles', 'Cronenburg', 'honed', 'art', 'Beckettian', 'austerity', 'bleak', 'interiors', 'drab', 'colours', 'no', 'longer', 'ram-raiding', 'subconscious', 'psychology', ""'dead"", 'soul', 'beneath', 'layers', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'unravelling', 'disconnected', 'psyche', 'spaced', 'out', 'years', 'solitary', 'musings', 'hinterland', 'mind.This', 'clarity', 'sombreness', 'masterpiece.Cronenburg', 'best', 'film', 'yet']",Spider

Feinnes did his usual amazing job in a very difficult role, Miranda Richardson shifted back and forth nicely from the solidly middle-class good mother to the reptillian whore-mother.  Gabriel Byrne wasn't given much to do, and the boy who played Dennis did quite well.However, I'm seeing reviews from people who simply didn't get this film at all, and I feared that might be the case though I don't think Cronenberg could've been more unambiguous about the identity of the women.  There was no prostitute, there was only his mother and his father.  The issues Dennis had with his mother's sexuality was the basis of of his madness.  When he sees his father murder his mother and replace her with a prostitute, it's in his imagination.  His parents' sex life effectively kills the good, non-sexual mother and replaces her with the bad whore-mother.  Both sides of the mother, whore and good mother, were played by Miranda Richardson.  And if that wasn't clear enough, by the end, Dennis is seeing the manager of the halfway house he's in with as this same whore-mother, also played by Miranda Richardson.I understand that sometimes plots can throw people for a loop, but this sort of casting is, as I indicated, pretty unambiguous and that people aren't catching it suggests  that they're not paying adequate attention to the film.

But I had to chime in.WARNING: Some of the reviewers have given away the secrets and plot twists to this amazing pyschological thriller. BE CAREFUL or this may ruin your viewing experience. One of the joys of this film for me was the revelation of themes and the mystery of Spider's delusional mind. Having heard very little about this film even after hearing Cronenberg talk on NPR, this film took me by complete surprise. The ending absolutely fooled me and the method Cronenberg uses to reveal Spider's delusion is brilliant. I still did not know about this device until the credits were rolling. I felt naive because it all seemed so obvious. This is what I love about film. Being duped. Thanks, Cronenberg! (I hope I haven't given anything away.)As stated before, this is a bleak mood piece about a schizophrenic ghost of a man who is released from an asylum. Plagued by visions of his childhood, he slowly reenacts the apparent cause of his insanity. It's a very barren and minimalist piece of film making that is not for everyone. The performances are flawless. The pallette is dark and drab. The pacing is slow. The images are stark and brooding. The image of Spider scrawling in his mad hieroglyphic diary with smoke stained hands against a dirty wall framed in heavy shadow left me breathless. It's a scene of isolated madness like no other.I have never considered myself a big fan of Cronenberg. I've always loved THE FLY. NAKED LUNCH left me confused. The William Burroughs novel of the same name is stream of consciousness nightmare vision and almost impossible to translate into film. Very brave of Cronenberg to try. DEAD RINGERS was disturbingly delicious. But SPIDER may be Cronenberg's best film. If he were to make another film as stunning as this one I just might become one of his biggest fans.This film is for adults who like mystery, themes of madness, and smart mood pieces. Teenagers or others looking for a standard horror movie may want to look elsewhere.WATCHING THE CONCLUSION I FELT AS IF I HAD WITNESSED SOMETHING HITCHCOCK WOULD HAVE KILLED TO DIRECT, HAD HE STILL BEEN ALIVE. THIS FILM MAY EVEN SURPASS ANYTHING OF PSYCHOLOGICAL SUSPENSE THE MASTER MAY HAVE DIRECTED. BRAVO, CRONENBERG!
