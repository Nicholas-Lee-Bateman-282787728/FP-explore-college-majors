Now, the acting is very good, the scenery is amazing and eerie, it's what I expected to look like when I saw the cover of it. There is plenty of gore and in very gruesome ways, the subway scene is historic! There is one scene from this movie that is a really famous painting, let's see if you will know what scene I'm talking about. I liked the ending of the movie, it's a real twist, but I was expecting alot more. I kept saying to myself, this has to be the scene where the dead rise! But there are no zombies in this movie so don't expect any, there's alot of de javu in this, but I really expected more, like a battle between good and evil. The atmosphere couldn't have been any better, if you're a horror fan wanting to watch something different, with a really creepy atmosphere watch this movie. If you're looking for a horror movie with tons of action, look elsewhere, though this was fun to watch it leave me wanting to know more about what happened, that's probably the reason I wasn't too satisfied with it, because it leaves you wanting something.

680627,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00005RYLA,Dave. K,"[1, 3]","The Church is the 2nd feature film from director Michele Soavi who was dubbed as the savior to Italian horror. Soavi came around when Italian horror was on its last legs. With the exception of Dario Argento a lot of the other popular filmmakers were on the decline, were having trouble getting work or became knockoff directors. Michele Soavi was hailed as the savior and to be honest I never quite got why.Originally The Church was meant to be the 3rd part of the Demons series, but it ended up going in a different direction and what we get is a very mixed bag. The Church wasn't a bad movie, but the problem is nothing really happens.The screenplay was written by Dario Argento, Franco Ferrini & Michele Soavi. Dardano Sacchetti, Lamberto Bava and Fabrizio Bava also contributed to the screenplay, but were un-credited. So due to that I'll just mention the credited writers.The screenplay actually wasn't too bad; there were some interesting concepts, while there might be a silly moment or two for the most part the script wasn't bad. The basic concept here is the same as Demons, but there was a little more depth to the screenplay. Demons and Demons 2 were fun splatter flicks, but The Church was more serious. The biggest problem here is the lack of action. The screenplay really wasn't too bad and made even better by what was coming out of Italy at this time.But there are some problems; the two lead characters pretty much go MIA in the 2nd half, other characters might appear early on than don't come back until the end. The 2nd half introduces some new characters and they don't add anything to the plot. They are just there to die and we don't even see most of the deaths.The Church does benefit from a solid cast, Giovanni Lombardo Radice has a small role and it's always great seeing him in a horror movie and a young Asia Argento also stars. The Church was Asia's 3rd movie.Michele Soavi worked under Dario Argento as an assistant director and it is quite clear he learned a lot. Dario Argento is a very visual filmmaker and if I didn't know any better I would think he was the director. Soavi creates a movie that is visually stunning. The Church is one of the very best shot movies I have ever seen. Dare I say it's on par with an Argento movie?The problem though is really nothing happens. The first few minutes are set in the medieval times and we get a little bit of action, but surprisingly little gore. After that we cut to the present and from that point on it's mostly talk and more talk. Michele Soavi is able to build some suspense and tension, but the problem is there is no pay off; though to Soavi's credit he's very much able to have a nice gothic looking horror movie.Like I said The Church is slow, but what saves the movie from being an all out bore is the visuals. The first half in particular is just so amazingly shot. The Church easily rates as one of the best shot horror movies I have ever seen. In the case of Italian filmmakers not all, but most have this great visual side to their movies and Michele Soavi might be one of the best. The student can't top his teacher though, but you can clearly see the Argento influence. There is some great stedi-cam work as well.Once we hit the 45-minute mark things begin to pick up with an excellent scene, which a character is chased around her house and I thought right there would be the turning point, but instead after that nothing really happens again. Once the hour mark comes in we have a group of characters trapped in the church and it seems like the action is about to start, but guess again.This is the biggest downfall to The Church the lack of action like I said we get some good moments of suspense and tension, but there is very little pay off. Despite the lack of anything happening Michele Soavi is able to create some tension and suspense thanks to his visual touch and that is what kept me interested in the movie despite the lack of action. The final act to The Church is kind of messy and more often than not the movie just sort of repeats itself by this point and the ending is very anti-climatic. If you are expecting a big showdown between the characters and demons you can forget that.I can't really explain why I enjoyed The Church; there is very little action, but the gore level is decent. While it might take sometime to get to the gore and when we finally get it, well it seems like a long time till we get it again, but it is done well. But not a whole lot happens. It's a lot of talk and build up with little pay off, but yet there is just something about The Church I liked. I guess it's the visual side that held my interest, but the 2nd half none of this works as well.In closing, The Church is a movie with a lot of potential, but just doesn't seem to go anywhere. Even though I did enjoy the movie it's not a must see and it's really the visual side that keeps things interesting, but that can only save it for so long.The Church sometimes goes under the title of Demons 3 along with two other movies, 1 being Lamberto Bava's The Orge and Umberto Lenzi's Black Demons. None though are sequels to Demons, but The Church is the closest one in that style.",3,Decent movie mostly saved by the visual side,1193788800,"10 31, 2007",2007,5171,"['Church', '2nd', 'feature',

The ""Demons"" series is a lackluster and tedious affair, it would have benefited greatly with this entry since it would have guaranteed at least one good film in the series. ""The Church, although lacking on several aspects, is light years ahead of them.The story begins in an unholy village whose inhabitants are ruthlessly massacred by the church. A large cathedral is then built over the massacre site in order to keep the ""evil"" buried forevermore. However, not even God's temple could prevent what is about to take place. Several centuries later, in modern times, the cursed victims are accidentally resurrected. The invisible demons possess and attack several unlucky people who happen to be locked inside the haunted structure.This original horror film is somewhat creative, beautifully filmed but very chatty so patience is definitely necessary. For those of you who stick it out, you will be awarded with several scenes of artistic merit and intense gore. Michele Soavi, like Argento, Fulci and Bava, did not shy away from depicting loss of life in the most unsettling manner. There is a disturbing and graphic suicide scene that should please ""Gore-hounds"". There is also a neck impaling, a face ripping, and a very humorous demise involving a speeding subway.

However, fans of the genre really don't care about these films shortcomings because they more than make up for it with their visual style and awesome body count. It's also a very attractive looking movie. Several of the main actor's are very attractive as is the stunning church location and cinematography. Argento/Soavi fans should enjoy this surreal but confusing tale of Satanists, Satan and everything else that is unholy. Don't expect ""Demons 3""- this film is far superior to both of those Bava atrocities.

680632,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00005RYLA,General Zombie,"[21, 23]","This is a great atmospheric, gothic horror film with a bit of gore to spice things up.  There's not much going on as far as plot is concerned.  We have a prologue showing a group of Templars massacreing a supposedly Satannically obsessed pack of villagers, and then building a cathedral over top of the burial ground.  Fast forward to the modern day, where a demonic curse is released by an overly curious librarian, leading to havoc and the trapping of a number of individuals within the cathedral.  That's about the short and long of it.  People are possessed by demons, demons run amuck, the cathedral is shot ominously, it's all rainy, characters do little but release demons/be possessed by demons/be killed by demons etc.  The plot doesn't much matter, and Soavi doesn't let it get in the way of the good stuff.This has got some really good production values, and the acting is generally quite good by the standards of this sort of fare.(I particularly the librarian, during the day after he was possessed, but before things really go crazy.)  Virtually all the performances are acceptable, at the very least, with the exception of the whiny old man, who is very annoying.  I'm not as impressed by the demon effects as some are.  Personally, I think they are simultaneously quite impressive technically, and a bit hokey in design.  However, they are given a minimum of screen time, and work pretty well when used in such a manner.  The gore is generally very well executed, with the exception of the decapitation in the opening scene, which is a bit weak.  The highlight is, obviously, the suicide by Jackhammer.  A hideous concept executed beautifully.  Other than that we've got a guy impaled on a spier, impalation through the neck with a gate, facial self-mutilation, a chick getting smashed by a subway car, another decapitated head etc.  Generally, the gore works well.  Too much gore would've been inappropriate, but without any things might've been a bit too slow and uneventful.  Soavi finds just the right balance.This film is all about atmosphere. The entire film has a fairly dark, oppressive air to it, particularly in the opening section and the scenes after they're trapped in the cathedral.(The shots of them just sitting around the cathedra waiting are particularly effective) Soavi's camerwork is obviously influenced by his mentor Argento, using lots of low-angle shots, and lots of slow, prowling shots examining the interior of the cathedral.  However, unlike Argento, the cathedral is largely presented as is, without the colored lighting and bizarre set design you frequently find in an Argento film.(This is the way it should be; the cathedral itself is ominous enough.)  The soundtrack, partially done by Goblin, is quite effective.  It's nothing particularly surprising, but it's nice and ominous without being overbearing or hokey.Fans of Dario Argento will probably want to check this out.  It's quite different from anything I've seen from him, but it's got a bit of the same flavor.  Fans of The Beyond may also want to check this out, provided they actually enjoyed the atmospheric portions of the Beyond along with the gore.  Personally, I was sufficiently impressed that I'm really looking forward to seeing the rest of Soavi's films, should they ever get released on DVD.(or arrive at my house... stupid mailman)Also, its got hot demon sex.",4,Stylish and Odd,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,3380,"['great', 'atmospheric', 'gothic', 'horror', 'film', 'bit', 'gore', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'not', 'much', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'concerned', 'have', 'prologue', 'showing', 'group', 'Templars', 'massacreing', 'supposedly', 'Satannically', 'obsessed', 'pack', 'villagers', 'then', 'building', 'cathedral', 'top', 'burial', 'ground', 'Fast', 'forward', 'modern', 'day', 'where', 'demonic', 'curse', 'released', 'overly', 'curious', 'librarian', 'leading', 'havoc', 'trapping', 'number', 'individuals', 'cathedral', 'short', 'long', 'People', 'are', 'possessed', 'demons', 'demons', 'run', 'amuck', 'cathedral', 'shot', 'ominously', 'rainy', 'characters', 'do', 'little', 'release', 'demons/be', 'possessed', 'demons/be', 'killed', 'demons', 'etc', 'plot', ""n't"", 'much', 'matter', 'Soavi', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'way', 'good', 'stuff.This', 'got', 'really', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'generally', 'quite', 'good', 'standards', 'sort', 'fare', 'particularly', 'librarian', 'day', 'was', 'possessed', 'things', 'really', 'go', 'crazy', 'Virtually', 'performances', 'are', 'acceptable', 'very', 'least', 'exception', 'whiny', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'annoying', ""'m"", 'not', 'impressed', 'demon', 'effects', 'are', 'Personally', 'think', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'quite', 'impressive', 'technically', 'bit', 'hokey', 'design', 'However', 'are', 'given', 'minimum', 'screen', 'time', 'work', 'pretty', 'well', 'when', 'used', 'such', 'manner', 'gore', 'generally', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'exception', 'decapitation', 'opening', 'scene', 'bit', 'weak', 'highlight', 'obviously', 'suicide', 'Jackhammer', 'A', 'hideous', 'concept', 'executed', 'beautifully', 'Other', ""'ve"", 'got', 'guy', 'impaled', 'spier', 'impalation', 'neck', 'gate', 'facial', 'self-mutilation', 'chick', 'getting', 'smashed', 'subway', 'car', 'decapitated', 'head', 'etc', 'Generally', 'gore', 'well', 'Too', 'much', 'gore', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'inappropriate', 'things', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'uneventful', 'Soavi', 'just', 'right', 'balance.This', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'entire', 'film', 'fairly', 'dark', 'oppressive', 'air', 'particularly', 'opening', 'section', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'trapped', 'cathedral', 'shots', 'just', 'sitting', 'cathedra', 'waiting', 'are', 'particularly', 'effective', 'Soavi', 'camerwork', 'obviously', 'influenced', 'mentor', 'Argento', 'using', 'lots', 'low-angle', 'shots', 'lots', 'slow', 'prowling', 'shots', 'examining', 'interior', 'cathedral', 'However', 'Argento', 'cathedral', 'largely', 'presented', 'colored', 'lighting', 'bizarre', 'set', 'design', 'frequently', 'find', 'Argento', 'film', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'cathedral', 'ominous', 'enough', 'soundtrack', 'partially', 'done', 'Goblin', 'quite', 'effective', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'surprising', 'nice', 'ominous', 'being', 'overbearing', 'hokey.Fans', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'quite', 'different', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'got', 'bit', 'same', 'flavor', 'Fans', 'Beyond', 'may', 'also', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'provided', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'atmospheric', 'portions', 'Beyond', 'gore', 'Personally', 'was', 'sufficiently', 'impressed', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'rest', 'Soavi', 'films', 'should', 'ever', 'get', 'released', 'DVD', 'arrive', 'house', 'stupid', 'mailman', 'Also', 'got', 'hot', 'demon', 'sex']",The Church

One day my eyes fell upon The Church because it had the Dario Argento name on it, and finally decided to fork over the money for it because the back stated ""originally know as Demons 3"", and I loved the first two Demons films and with Argento producing, how could this film goe wrong? It does. The film starts off very promisesing with a great beginning score by Goblin and then switching to knights galloping to a town full of witches. When the film changes to modern day, and then the film falls apart. It's not director Michele Soavi'd fault, he just has very little to work with in Argeno's script. The script just has huge plot holes. So big, that they insult my intellegence. Sometimes people are possessed by demons just because and some because they are scratched (like in the first two demons movies). The church was originally full of children when it was closed up, and suddenly the kids disappear. What was with Asia Argento's character also appearing in a past flashback. People who have seen this know what I mean and those of you about to see it will see what I mean. Sure Demons 2 had plot wholes, but at least it was fun to watch. The Church, sadly doesn't have near the entertainment value. The only thing that keeps the film moving is Michele Soavi's catchy camera work. Otherwise if fails miserably. I've seen the film two times and I can't get forgive some of these mistakes. Michele Soavi has directed some great horror films (Cemetery Man comes to mind), but The Church isn't one of them.

When the possession begins to spread, an ancient lockdown goes into effect trapping the caretakers, employees, a tour of school children, and others within the church walls. It's left to one noble priest, with the help of a rebellious young girl, to prevent the plague from escaping into the world outside.Produced by Italian horror legend Dario Argento and directed by Michele Soavi of ""Cemetery Man"" fame (Dellamorte Dellamore), ""The Church"" (La chiesa) was originally planned to be the third installment of the Demons franchise. However, director Soavi wanted to make something better, and the result is a more mature film, though surely not as much fun as the original ""Demons"". The story is an interesting one, as is the film throughout, though I would have personally preferred more insight into the lead characters and a clearer explanation of some of the medieval events that set up the situation. Of course, this is an Italian horror film we're talking about here. Personally, I have always found them somewhat lacking, though they have their good points too (I rather enjoyed Demons when I finally saw it and look forward to getting it, and Cemetery Man is well-known to be a fantastic little film). With dubbing, it can be hard to judge performances, and some of the dubbing is goofy, as always, but the stars do well, especially Hugh Quarshie as Father Gus and Argento's daughter Asia, who is very cute here as little Lotte (took me a while to recognize her). If you are a fan of Italian horror, Dario and/or Asia Argento, and so on, this is a must own. It's pretty good for that sub-genre. However, if you know you don't like Italian horror, I wouldn't recommend it to you. If you're in the middle, rent it at least.

680643,A1P7OC8CAP5KPG,B00005RYLA,Nickolas Cook,"[2, 3]","THE CHURCHReview by Nickolas CookIn medieval Europe, a band of crusading knights massacre a village of suspected devil worshippers, and then build a large gothic church atop the cursed remains.Flash-forward to present day, to the still-standing elaborate cathedral, as a visiting historian uncovers an ancient bit of parchment that helps him unlock the basement crypt/doorway to Hell.  Archaic mechanisms click into place, trapping a group of people inside the church as all Hell breaks loose.Co-written and produced by maestro Dario Argento (Suspiria), THE CHURCH helped to cement the reputation of director Michele Soavi (Stagefright, Cemetery Man, two fantastic horror flicks of incredible visceral humor and intelligence) as the new master of Italian horror. This was originally intended to be a spinoff of Bava and Argento's DEMONS and its sequel, and was known as DEMONS 3, but the studio decied after seeing its complexity and stunning visual to release it as a standalone picture instead.All I can say is: if you've never seen this one, you're missing a hell of a visual treat.  Anchor Bay take this underrated classic of Italian horror and really give it the tender lovin' care it deserves for a DVD release.  The full screen is especially awesome during those sprawling architectural trawl shots that Soavi uses to wonderful effect.  The sound is enhanced, so even a regular television still picks up those little nuances that make the background sound work so well.  And the music...WOW!  How can you pass up a chance to hear not just the great idols of Italian horror soundtracks, Goblin, but also Keith Emerson?  The music plays like another character to the story, as it winds and insinuates itself throughout Soavi's dark scenery.A very young Asia Argento turns up as Latia, daughter to the abusive church maintenance man.  The rest of the cast gives great performances as the church begins to eat them up, one at a time.There are two scenes in particular that I'd like to point out, and they stand for me as demarcations in THE CHURCH, cinematic moments that tell you that the people who put them together knew their business visually, and knew that what they were doing was bigger than themselves.  They're both towards the end.  One is a full screen shot of a man who has become a demon.  He's winged and even has a winding Boa Constrictor-like tail.  The shot is so sweet for a horror fan that it'll bring tears to your eyes.And if that one doesn't do it, then the second shot will for sure.It's a full head-shot of a demon rising from the crypt beneath the church.  But the head is made up of dozens of people hanging together on this massive framework to give the subtle impression of a demon's face slowly coming up from Hell.Incredible.As I said, Anchor Bay really puts their hearts and souls into this one, folks.  They even present it uncut, uncensored and fully restored from the original vault materials.  THE CHURCH is a must-own for true-blue horror fans, and for anyone who loves the pure visual beauty of film.--Nickolas Cook",4,Italian horror art,1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,3056,"['CHURCHReview', 'Nickolas', 'CookIn', 'medieval', 'Europe', 'band', 'crusading', 'knights', 'massacre', 'village', 'suspected', 'devil', 'worshippers', 'then', 'build', 'large', 'gothic', 'church', 'cursed', 'remains.Flash-forward', 'present', 'day', 'still-standing', 'elaborate', 'cathedral', 'visiting', 'historian', 'uncovers', 'ancient', 'bit', 'parchment', 'unlock', 'basement', 'crypt/doorway', 'Hell', 'Archaic', 'mechanisms', 'click', 'place', 'trapping', 'group', 'people', 'church', 'Hell', 'breaks', 'loose.Co-written', 'produced', 'maestro', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Suspiria', 'THE', 'CHURCH', 'helped', 'cement', 'reputation', 'director', 'Michele', 'Soavi', 'Stagefright', 'Cemetery', 'Man', 'two', 'fantastic', 'horror', 'flicks', 'incredible', 'visceral', 'humor', 'intelligence', 'new', 'master', 'Italian', 'horror', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'be', 'spinoff', 'Bava', 'Argento', 'DEMONS', 'sequel', 'was', 'known', 'DEMONS', '3', 'studio', 'decied', 'seeing', 'complexity', 'stunning', 'visual', 'release', 'standalone', 'picture', 'instead.All', 'can', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'one', ""'re"", 'missing', 'hell', 'visual', 'treat', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'take', 'underrated', 'classic', 'Italian', 'horror', 'really', 'give', 'tender', 'lovin', 'care', 'DVD', 'release', 'full', 'screen', 'especially', 'awesome', 'sprawling', 'architectural', 'trawl', 'shots', 'Soavi', 'wonderful', 'effect', 'sound', 'enhanced', 'so', 'even', 'regular', 'television', 'still', 'up', 'little', 'nuances', 'make', 'background', 'sound', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'music', 'WOW', 'How', 'can', 'pass', 'up', 'chance', 'hear', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'idols', 'Italian', 'horror', 'soundtracks', 'Goblin', 'also', 'Keith', 'Emerson', 'music', 'character', 'story', 'Soavi', 'dark', 'scenery.A', 'very', 'young', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'up', 'Latia', 'daughter', 'abusive', 'church', 'maintenance', 'man', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'performances', 'church', 'eat', 'up', 'one', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'particular', ""'d"", 'like', 'point', 'out', 'stand', 'demarcations', 'THE', 'CHURCH', 'cinematic', 'moments', 'tell', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'together', 'knew', 'business', 'visually', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'was', 'bigger', ""'re"", 'end', 'One', 'full', 'screen', 'shot', 'man', 'who', 'become', 'demon', 'winged', 'even', 'winding', 'Boa', 'Constrictor-like', 'tail', 'shot', 'so', 'sweet', 'horror', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes.And', 'one', ""n't"", 'do', 'then', 'second', 'shot', 'will', 'sure.It', 'full', 'head-shot', 'demon', 'rising', 'crypt', 'church', 'head', 'made', 'dozens', 'people', 'hanging', 'together', 'massive', 'framework', 'give', 'subtle', 'impression', 'demon', 'face', 'slowly', 'coming', 'up', 'Hell.Incredible.As', 'said', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'really', 'hearts', 'souls', 'one', 'folks', 'even', 'present', 'uncut', 'uncensored', 'fully', 'restored', 'original', 'vault', 'materials', 'CHURCH', 'must-own', 'true-blue', 'horror', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'pure', 'visual', 'beauty', 'film.', 'Nickolas', 'Cook']",The Church

Now, Soavi got his start as an assistant director for Dario Argento, and Argento wrote the script, so it should come as little shock that La Chiesa comes off kind of like second-rate Argento. (Argento's daughter Asia even has a minor part in the film, as she did increasingly often in Argento films during the eighties.) Plotwise, anyway. While Soavi's direction does wear his Argento influence writ large on its sleeve, he learned all the right things from the master of Italian horror, and there's enough actual Soavi in there to ensure that you at least sense this isn't completely an Argento joint (as was, say, ""Lamberto Bava""'s Demons).We open with an extended scene that takes place during what seems to be the Inquisition or the Crusades, in which an entire village is slaughtered for witchcraft and a mad monk tells the murderers to build a church on the land; the consecrated ground will stop the dead from coming back. Fast-forward to the twentieth century. A new librarian starts working at the church while some restoration is going on. The combination of these two things kicks into motion a series of events that ensures, of course, that the dead will, in fact, come back for some sinister purpose. When the dead trip off one of the safety mechanisms, the church is sealed off from the outside, trapping a number of innocents with the vengeful spirits. If you've seen Demons, you know what's going to happen from that point. (The script was originally conceived as a third entry in the Demons series, but Soavi rewrote it to the point where La Chiesa has very little in common with the other films in the franchise. Two other attempts were made to produce a third Demons film, Black Demons and The Ogre; both, interestingly, met the same fate as La Chiesa. Someone must have realized that if Demons 2 was that bad, the series was unsaveable. And thank heaven for that.)The acting is mediocre, the script not much better; neither is remotely up to the standard Soavi would set for himself with Dellamorte Dell'Amore five years later. What is here and intact, however, is Soavi's incredible visual sense, which is even more pronounced here than it is in his later work. I do note that this may well be because you don't have such niceties as plot, character development, etc., to distract you from Soavi's constant barrage of gorgeously-constructed shots. It's a gorgeous movie, and those who simply appreciate the fine visuals will find this a treat; most filmgoers, however, will likely not be satisfied with a pastiche held together so thinly. For them, I recommend Dellamorte Dell'Amore instead. ***",3,Soavi in 1989 > Argento in 1989.,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,2821,"['La', 'Chiesa', 'Michele', 'Soavi', '1989', 'Michele', 'Soavi', 'Dellamorte', ""Dell'Amore"", 'one', 'best', 'horror-comedies', 'time', 'when', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'one', 'earlier', 'films', 'La', 'Chiesa', 'jumped', 'Now', 'Soavi', 'got', 'start', 'assistant', 'director', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Argento', 'wrote', 'script', 'should', 'come', 'little', 'shock', 'La', 'Chiesa', 'kind', 'second-rate', 'Argento', 'Argento', 'daughter', 'Asia', 'even', 'minor', 'part', 'film', 'did', 'increasingly', 'often', 'Argento', 'films', 'eighties', 'Plotwise', 'anyway', 'Soavi', 'direction', 'wear', 'Argento', 'influence', 'writ', 'large', 'sleeve', 'learned', 'right', 'things', 'master', 'Italian', 'horror', 'enough', 'actual', 'Soavi', 'there', 'ensure', 'least', 'sense', ""n't"", 'completely', 'Argento', 'joint', 'was', 'say', 'Lamberto', 'Bava', 'Demons', '.We', 'open', 'extended', 'scene', 'place', 'what', 'be', 'Inquisition', 'Crusades', 'entire', 'village', 'slaughtered', 'witchcraft', 'mad', 'monk', 'murderers', 'build', 'church', 'land', 'consecrated', 'ground', 'will', 'stop', 'dead', 'coming', 'back', 'Fast-forward', 'twentieth', 'century', 'new', 'librarian', 'working', 'church', 'restoration', 'going', 'combination', 'two', 'things', 'kicks', 'motion', 'series', 'events', 'course', 'dead', 'will', 'fact', 'come', 'back', 'sinister', 'purpose', 'When', 'dead', 'trip', 'one', 'safety', 'mechanisms', 'church', 'sealed', 'off', 'outside', 'trapping', 'number', 'innocents', 'vengeful', 'spirits', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Demons', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'point', 'script', 'was', 'originally', 'conceived', 'third', 'entry', 'Demons', 'series', 'Soavi', 'rewrote', 'point', 'where', 'La', 'Chiesa', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'other', 'films', 'franchise', 'Two', 'other', 'attempts', 'were', 'made', 'produce', 'third', 'Demons', 'film', 'Black', 'Demons', 'Ogre', 'interestingly', 'met', 'same', 'fate', 'La', 'Chiesa', 'Someone', 'must', 'have', 'realized', 'Demons', '2', 'was', 'bad', 'series', 'was', 'unsaveable', 'thank', 'heaven', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'script', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'remotely', 'standard', 'Soavi', 'would', 'set', 'Dellamorte', ""Dell'Amore"", 'five', 'years', 'later', 'What', 'here', 'intact', 'however', 'Soavi', 'incredible', 'visual', 'sense', 'even', 'more', 'pronounced', 'here', 'later', 'work', 'do', 'note', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'niceties', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'etc.', 'distract', 'Soavi', 'constant', 'barrage', 'gorgeously-constructed', 'shots', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'who', 'simply', 'appreciate', 'fine', 'visuals', 'will', 'find', 'treat', 'most', 'filmgoers', 'however', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'be', 'satisfied', 'pastiche', 'held', 'together', 'so', 'thinly', 'recommend', 'Dellamorte', ""Dell'Amore"", 'instead', '***']",The Church

The storyline is too convoluted; it twists and turns like a multi-headed snake, going in too many directions and not following through with several of the main characters, and there are MANY main characters; too many.  The first half promises a mysterious journey through the dark, secret passages of an ancient church built over the earth of a massacre that took place generations before.  We're never certain whether the ""innocents"" who were murdered by the Templar Knights were actually devil worshippers or just misunderstood early Christians, as possibly indicated by the stigmatas that mark the bottom of their feet.As for too many characters, we have a very sexy leading lady, and rugged handsome leading man, a striking ancient priest who seems at times like he will be the savior of earth, a young black priest, and an innocent young girl who is either the reincarnation of one of the murdered innocents from the past, or THE girl herself.

Stringini ""moviman7643""","[5, 7]","I have to say that I enjoyed a good portion of the movie, namely the first half, but once everyone gets stuck in the church, well, things collapse faster than the old builing itself.  What made this movie strong in the begining was that it didn't try to focus on to many characters.  But then we are introduced to everyone who is caught in the church.  Soon characters just vanish from the plot all together, and then re-appear later, and then vanish again.  And what happened to all the children?  There where like at least ten kids, and they all happen to magically vanish!  Plus, it is very hard to tell how people become transformed into demons in this film.  Some are scratched (as it was in Demons1), but some just magically change (like say the old woman).  The main fault of this film is that it doesn't commit to anything.  It throws all these things together, and only follows through on some of them.  So, yes, while the first half is quite good, and well written, the last half is nothing but pointless gore, sex, and an attempt at sounding sophisticated.

680650,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B00005RYLA,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[1, 1]","What's going on in the church?  Well, back in the middle ages a community of alleged devil worshippers get slaughtered by some templar-like knights.  After throwing the bodies in a pit, they get an alchemist to build a church on the pit.  Flash forward to nowdays and the church is up and running.  Some Curious George librarian decides to unravel the mystery, letting all the revenge-hungry demons out.  This is about one hour through the film.  For the remaining 40 minutes the people inside the Church are trapped and have to deal with all kinds of demon hocus pocus.  This project started out as a third Demons film, but went through some ch-ch-ch-changes.  There are similarities to the Demons films however.  The demonic possession in this film seems to spread from person to person in the form of a physical infection/sickness.  They even call it a ""plague"" at one point.  WILL THEY GET OUT ALIVE????  Dario Argento's protege, Michele Soavi(who went on to do the awesome Cemetery Man) obviously learned a thing or two from his teacher.  The Church isn't a fantastic film, but it's quite good and shows Soavi's potential.  It's not a total gorefest, it's only really gory when it has to be.  There is a very gruesome suicide by jackhammer that'll get your attention.  As others have pointed out, the devil monster in this film looks excellent.  And boy it does!  Too bad he's got about 5 seconds of screen time(and that's not really an exaggeration either).  For the price of this dvd it's quite a painless gamble.  If you like the Fulci approach to Italian horror, The Church can go either way with you.

Still, this work, teaming Argento with Michele Soavi, is something of a favorite of mine. As viewers, we find ourselves introduced to a church that was, in times past, erected to contain the pesky menace of its vengeful, longtime occupants. To illustrate this, we get a lovely sequence showing the seeming slaughter and subsequent burial of all an entire village. It looks like brutality at its finest at first, but then, as hands grasp at those who try to trap the damned here, the crusaders seem to have found more than they can handle. So, how do you handle this? Why, seal it up and build a church on it, of course! Fastforwarding to the future, the church and its guarded secret is threatened and, of course, unleashed upon those unlucky enough to be trapped inside. Of course, this leads to an ending most befitting.This film brims with an eerie atmosphere that, most deservedly, helped gain Soavi a reputation as an excellent filmmaker, plus it has some nice Darioesque qualities as well. Asia Argento is here, just begging to become victimized by yet another manifestation of evil, and Goblin gives us another work of art. Combining these qualities with the fact that even the subway, a normally defunct ""roadblock"" at best, finds itself an unlikely killing machine, I'd have to recommend it as something to use to tuck the children in.Strengthening the family ties with the fear of demonic possession, that's the trait of a loving parent.

680652,AI0PLL5DQAHRG,B00005RYLA,"Ty Arthur ""xFiruath""","[3, 4]","""The Church"" was my first foray into Italian horror films, and the first time I've ever seen anything by Argento or Soavi.  I completely understand now why so many people despise this genre, but I can also see the merit in it.  This film was very focused on atmosphere and setup, and to be blunt, completely ignored all plot and contuinity.  The costumes and sets were all done very well.  The medieval knights and the villiage they invade at the beginning of the film obviously had a lot of work put into them, as I didn't even once think ""Oh, the director invaded a costume store half an hour before shooting began"" as I have in other low budget films with medieval sequences.  The actual demons themselves, which are curiously hidden from the camera for most of the film, were also done in stunning detail.  Although its all obviously rubber suit type effects, they still manage to hold their own, even against more modern demon effects seen in newer films.  The crazy effects at the climax of the film were amazing! *potential spoiler of the end here - skip to the next paragraph if you want to see the effect before reading about it*  A giant writhing ball of human corpses covered in some sort of evil alchemical mud gunk rises up from below the church in unholy glory...how often does that happen in a movie? Of course, the giant ball of corpses leads me to the problems in the movie, namely that absolutely nothing makes any kind of sense.  Why is there a giant ball of corpses (the bodies of the villagers killed at the beginning of the film would have been decomposed into nothingness by this time, so don't try to tell me it was them)?  Why doesn't it actually DO anything, besides writhe around?  None of this is even attempted to be answered.Random events occur for no apparent reason, other than that they fit the mood and tone of the movie.  Likewise, all the characters behave in bizarre and completely illogical ways, with no attempt at an explanation for their insane actions.  The laws of reality are constantly bent and broken to make any given scene work.  At one point, a man commits suicide with a jackhammer.  Nevermind that that would probably be physically impossible - you'd need someone else to hold the jackhammer for you.  Later, the same person who should have a gaping jackhammer-induced hole in his body, appears whole and undamaged to tear apart an iron fence and then stab someone in the throat with it.  There are at least 10 or 20 witnesses to the murder - do they freak out?  Try to subdue the crazy man killing people?  React at all, in any way?  Nope.  The murderer and the victim just conviently dissapear, all traces of the crime gone in a puff of illogic, and everyone who witnessed the act goes on as if nothing out of the ordinary just occured.  Later on an old woman and her husband climb to the top of the church to ring a giant bell, in an attempt to alert the outside world that they are trapped inside.  When they reach the bell, the movie cuts to a different scene and the old folks are ignored for a time.  When we cut back to them, the old woman is banging the bell with her husband's decapitated head.  When and how did the man become decapitated?  Why is the old woman banging the head against the bell, instead of running around screaming because her husband just died?  We are expected to just accept this all at face value.  Oh, and apparently you can also tear your heart out by putting your fingers partway into your belly button.  Human anatomy seems to have changed significantly since I last studied it...The story itself has a giant contradiction as well.  The entire movie is based on the premise that the villagers were in fact some sort of devil worshippers who could become demonic beings and that they were freed from their prison to wreak havoc on the world.  However, towards the end of the film we are given a flashback were the architect of the church explains that the massacred town consisted of ordinary people who had the misfortuen to contract the plague - and that the church confused sickness with black magic.  Apparently the templars were wrong the whole time - those villagers weren't demons, they were just normal people.  So just ignore all the unleashed demonic things killing everyone around you in the mysterious sealed off church - they aren't real, and you are a superstitious and closed minded religious nut for believing in them. The list of contradictions and obsurdities could literally go on for pages.  However, if you are the sort of person who actively seeks out this kind of movie, none of that will matter to you, so don't worry about it, there's plenty of demonic mayhem here to keep you placated.The acting was pretty bad, especially by all the templar knights and priests.  The only exception was Hugh Quarshie, who played Brother Gus.  You can tell he is actually trying to put some life into his role and play it for all he's worth.  Unfortunately, when everyone else is doing such a laughably terrible job, it really makes his attempts seem bad too.  This style of film seems to be a bit an acquired taste.  If a movie with no plot whatsoever, but really great demon infested sets and effects makes you go ""Hell yes!"", then this is a movie for you.  Otherwise, don't waste your time here, you'll end up wanting to bang your head repeatedly against the nearest blunt object.  Despite all the problems, I guess this sort of style kind of grows on you, as I've already ordered several more movies in the same vein.  If  I had to give this move a Grade, I'd go ""C-"", because there are some really cool things here, but they are all overshadowed by how ridiculous the movie can get.",3,Well that was certainly
