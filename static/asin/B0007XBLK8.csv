893255,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0007XBLK8,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","It is easy to see why award winning Jonathan Demme had a fascination with Jean Dominique and the continued saga of the democratic process in Haiti. The repression of the people of Haiti and the suppression of emerging democratic institutions, such as a free press, is both tragic and fascinating. This documentary film has a primary focus on Jean Dominique and his independent radio station but his heroic wife is a major voice of sanity and liberty throughout the film also. Democracy does not spring to life without supporting societal structures to support the democratic process. Public schools and a free press are two such structures necessary for a healthy emerging democratic process. Jean Dominique and his wife were heroes in establishing and defending the free press, primarily their radio station, in Haiti, which in many instances was the only voice of opposition to dictatorship. The film is composed of many interviews, taken at different points in time, and interspersed with historic documentation of riots and political footage. Some of the film takes place in Haiti and some takes place in New York when Dominique and his wife were in exile. Dominique recognized the terrific risks he took every day and he seemed to wish to live a full life so that he would have no regrets when he met this end. He is a fascinating man, full of the humor or irony and absurdity, telling of repression with a twisted smile on his face as if he were a modern Voltaire or Hobbes or Kafka. He is as realistic as Hobbes, as ironic as Voltaire, and has appreciation for the absurd like Kafka. Yet he is also a true patriot, a man who deeply loves his country and the people. His assassination outside the radio station in 2000 is almost a foregone conclusion and the viewer of this film senses that Dominique knew this end would come to him. The film certainly highlights the obvious corruption and evil of the regimes of Papa Doc and Baby Doc Duvalier but to its credit it also explores the complex political dynamics and chaos of the Aristide regime.The title is based on Dominique's background as an agricultural consultant but the title has a double meaning for it can also refer to the efforts of Dominique to grow democracy in his native land. Like many successful reformers before him, he comes from the upper class but is capable of empathy with the common people, which energizes his mission. The radio station was his medium by which he spread concepts of democracy and by doing so; he became a hero of the people. The film is excellent, not for wonderful cinematography or beautiful actresses, but rather for its obvious ability to tell the truth about repression and the spirit required to resist that repression.",5,Growing the spirit of freedom - the agronomist,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,2723,"['easy', 'see', 'why', 'award', 'winning', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'had', 'fascination', 'Jean', 'Dominique', 'continued', 'saga', 'democratic', 'process', 'Haiti', 'repression', 'people', 'Haiti', 'suppression', 'emerging', 'democratic', 'institutions', 'such', 'free', 'press', 'tragic', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'film', 'primary', 'focus', 'Jean', 'Dominique', 'independent', 'radio', 'station', 'heroic', 'wife', 'major', 'voice', 'sanity', 'liberty', 'film', 'also', 'Democracy', 'not', 'spring', 'life', 'supporting', 'societal', 'structures', 'support', 'democratic', 'process', 'Public', 'schools', 'free', 'press', 'are', 'two', 'such', 'structures', 'necessary', 'healthy', 'emerging', 'democratic', 'process', 'Jean', 'Dominique', 'wife', 'were', 'heroes', 'establishing', 'defending', 'free', 'press', 'primarily', 'radio', 'station', 'Haiti', 'many', 'instances', 'was', 'only', 'voice', 'opposition', 'dictatorship', 'film', 'composed', 'many', 'interviews', 'taken', 'different', 'points', 'time', 'interspersed', 'historic', 'documentation', 'riots', 'political', 'footage', 'film', 'place', 'Haiti', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'when', 'Dominique', 'wife', 'were', 'exile', 'Dominique', 'recognized', 'terrific', 'took', 'day', 'seemed', 'wish', 'live', 'full', 'life', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'regrets', 'when', 'met', 'end', 'fascinating', 'man', 'full', 'humor', 'irony', 'absurdity', 'telling', 'repression', 'twisted', 'smile', 'face', 'were', 'modern', 'Voltaire', 'Hobbes', 'Kafka', 'as', 'realistic', 'Hobbes', 'as', 'ironic', 'Voltaire', 'appreciation', 'absurd', 'Kafka', 'also', 'true', 'patriot', 'man', 'who', 'country', 'people', 'assassination', 'radio', 'station', '2000', 'almost', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'viewer', 'film', 'Dominique', 'knew', 'end', 'would', 'come', 'film', 'certainly', 'obvious', 'corruption', 'evil', 'regimes', 'Papa', 'Doc', 'Baby', 'Doc', 'Duvalier', 'credit', 'also', 'complex', 'political', 'dynamics', 'chaos', 'Aristide', 'regime.The', 'title', 'based', 'Dominique', 'background', 'agricultural', 'consultant', 'title', 'double', 'meaning', 'can', 'also', 'refer', 'efforts', 'Dominique', 'grow', 'democracy', 'native', 'land', 'many', 'successful', 'reformers', 'upper', 'class', 'capable', 'empathy', 'common', 'people', 'mission', 'radio', 'station', 'was', 'medium', 'spread', 'concepts', 'democracy', 'doing', 'so', 'became', 'hero', 'people', 'film', 'excellent', 'not', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'rather', 'obvious', 'ability', 'tell', 'truth', 'repression', 'spirit', 'required', 'resist', 'repression']",The Agronomist

For forty years Dominique was Haiti's most eloquent and outspoken political and human rights activist. Whether it was Papa Doc Duvalier, his son Baby Doc, Raoul Cedras, Jean Bertrand Aristide, Preval, the provisional puppet governments supported by America and run by the military, or the hated Macoutes thug-militia, Dominique spoke unvarnished truth and justice to power. He gave voice to the poorest of the poor in general and peasants in particular. When he was assassinated April 3, 2000 at the age of 70, he requested that his wife and the peasants together pour his ashes into the river. By training Dominique was an agronomist, but he became a national hero by force of his unflinching bravery, charming eloquence, and political passion. Late in the documentary he describes himself as always having had ""an unquenchable faith as a militant for true change."" With his journalist wife Michele Montas, he owned and operated Haiti's oldest and only free radio station, Radio Haiti, despite repeated episodes of harassment, torture, jail, and over six years of exile in Manhattan. Broadcasts were in native Creole rather than colonial French, connecting Dominique viscerally to the millions of powerless peasants. In addition, he produced Haiti's first film in Haiti by a Haitian, sensing that when you watch closely, you understand how a film becomes a political act. In 1965, Papa Doc's authorities permanently closed Haiti's first film club that he had started. Written and directed by Academy Award winner Jonathan Demme (Silence of the Lambs), who interviewed Dominique over a period of ten years, this documentary demonstrates how some times human history is driven from ""the bottom up"" rather than the ""top down.""

Pawl ""Dani""","[2, 2]","Though, I know of filmmaker Jonathan Demme (known best for THE CRYING GAME, among other films), I have never seen any of the films from his extensive body of work.  What's more, I knew even less of Haiti.  It was time that I receive an education, I felt, and what better way to do this than through viewing an intense and engrossing film like THE AGRONOMIST, one of the most beautifully crafted documentaries I have seen in a very long time.The film's title is in reference to Hatian radio journalist Jean Dominique (1930-2000), a great, charismatic and controversial part of Haitian mass media and history for the forty years he was on the air, with RADIO HAITI, his radio station, founded in 1960.  For those of you unfamiliar with agronomy, it is a type of agricultural science.  Receiving an education as an agronomist as a young man, from a very affluent mulatto family in Haiti, Dominique applied his acquired knowledge of the science of sustainable cultivation to help poor Haitian peasants, with their cash crop.  He also felt a calling to start up a film club, produce a Haitian documentary centered on voodoo, and eventually start his work as a very progressive journalist, challenging the corrupt politics of his very violent and turbulent government.  Eventually, Dominique was driven into exile, in New York, with his wife.Jonathan Demme began recording informal interviews with Dominique in 1986, juxtaposing his footage with newsreels documenting political violence in Haiti, as well as interviews with Dominique's wife, other family members and colleagues, leading up to his assasination in April of 2000.  His footage is compelling, profound and even (at times) humorous.  The very charismatic Jean Dominique was insightful, with a wit that cut like a knife, and interjected his pointed observations with bursts of humor and poetry.  What's more, the original musical soundtrack is fabulous.  Wyclef Jean and Jerry ""Wonder"" Duplessis bring great songs to this documentary piece, that add such color and flavor to the story.  THE AGRONOMIST is great and I am truly surprised that it didn't get more exposure!

893258,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0007XBLK8,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 4]","This is one of the most inspiring documentaries I've ever seen coming from my country. Jean Dominique's unparalleled quest for freedom really made my day and deepened my enormous respect for such idealists. Jonathan Demme creates a film that is no less absorbing and considerably more powerful. The film focuses on Jean Dominique, a Haitian radio station owner, journalist, and tireless human rights activist. Dominique was born to the thin upper crust of Haiti but turned his back on that class to advocate for the poor and landless. Exiled twice to America (in 1980 and 1991), he returned to Haiti both times to press for democracy and land reform. He was assassinated in April 2000, a deep loss for the Haitian people and the world.The film stitches together interviews Demme did with Jean Dominique over several years. Even from that grainy footage, it is apparent how charismatic Dominique was. His excitement is infectious; when he opens wide his eyes and smiles, we can't help but smile with him. At various stages, he talks about the ""risky business"" of operating a free radio station in a dictatorship, and we're inspired to undertake our own risky business in search of freedom. What's particularly impressive (and appealing) about Dominique is his indefatigable optimism. But when he talks about the CIA's role in his country, we're reminded of why giving that institution too much power (even in this age of terrorism) might not be such a good thing. His invitation to join his struggle along with his honesty and strength could not be bent. Only bullets could (and did) stop him.Another extremely touching aspect of his story is the level of bonding they had with his wife. It is such a rarity and such a wonderful thing to happen, that you cannot but feel happy that these two people have met and enjoyed their life together.""The Agronomist"" is far from a perfect film. Demme, who has directed such movies as ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Philadelphia,"" skips over important events and large blocks of time. Those not intimately familiar with Haiti's recent past may find it difficult to keep up. There is also a lack of context at certain points: what role have the various militias played? how has President Aristide affected the country and how has power changed him? By focusing so completely on the charismatic figure of Dominique, the documentary sometimes loses its way.Still, this is a rare glimpse into a country that's again in the news. As Dominique himself states, ""Cinema is a window on to the world...If you see a film correctly, the grammar of the film is a political act.""***Haiti remains the hemisphere's poorest nation, multiply burdened by unforgiving debt as well as increasing inability even to structure or even imagine another, more hopeful future. How sad Dominique would be to see what has happened in the seven years since his murder. And yet, how fiercely and relentlessly he would continue to fight for that hope. Indeed, how fierce and beautiful he remains in this film, a call for resistance against injustices both general and devastatingly specific.****",4,Death was not a defeat for this man,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,3097,"['one', 'most', 'inspiring', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'coming', 'country', 'Jean', 'Dominique', 'unparalleled', 'quest', 'freedom', 'really', 'made', 'day', 'deepened', 'enormous', 'respect', 'such', 'idealists', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'film', 'less', 'absorbing', 'considerably', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'Jean', 'Dominique', 'Haitian', 'radio', 'station', 'owner', 'journalist', 'tireless', 'human', 'rights', 'activist', 'Dominique', 'was', 'born', 'thin', 'upper', 'crust', 'Haiti', 'turned', 'back', 'class', 'advocate', 'poor', 'landless', 'Exiled', 'twice', 'America', '1980', '1991', 'returned', 'Haiti', 'times', 'press', 'democracy', 'land', 'reform', 'was', 'assassinated', 'April', '2000', 'deep', 'loss', 'Haitian', 'people', 'world.The', 'film', 'stitches', 'together', 'interviews', 'Demme', 'did', 'Jean', 'Dominique', 'several', 'years', 'Even', 'grainy', 'footage', 'apparent', 'how', 'charismatic', 'Dominique', 'was', 'excitement', 'infectious', 'when', 'wide', 'eyes', 'smiles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'various', 'stages', 'risky', 'business', 'operating', 'free', 'radio', 'station', 'dictatorship', ""'re"", 'inspired', 'undertake', 'own', 'risky', 'business', 'search', 'freedom', 'What', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'appealing', 'Dominique', 'indefatigable', 'optimism', 'when', 'CIA', 'role', 'country', ""'re"", 'reminded', 'why', 'giving', 'institution', 'too', 'much', 'power', 'even', 'age', 'terrorism', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'good', 'thing', 'invitation', 'join', 'struggle', 'honesty', 'strength', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'bent', 'Only', 'bullets', 'could', 'did', 'stop', 'him.Another', 'extremely', 'touching', 'aspect', 'story', 'level', 'bonding', 'had', 'wife', 'such', 'rarity', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'happen', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'happy', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'met', 'enjoyed', 'life', 'together', 'Agronomist', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'Demme', 'who', 'directed', 'such', 'movies', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Philadelphia', 'important', 'events', 'large', 'blocks', 'time', 'not', 'intimately', 'familiar', 'Haiti', 'recent', 'past', 'may', 'find', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'also', 'lack', 'context', 'certain', 'points', 'what', 'role', 'have', 'various', 'militias', 'played', 'how', 'President', 'Aristide', 'affected', 'country', 'how', 'power', 'changed', 'focusing', 'so', 'completely', 'charismatic', 'figure', 'Dominique', 'documentary', 'sometimes', 'way.Still', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'country', 'again', 'news', 'Dominique', 'Cinema', 'window', 'world', 'see', 'film', 'correctly', 'grammar', 'film', 'political', 'act', '***Haiti', 'hemisphere', 'poorest', 'nation', 'multiply', 'burdened', 'unforgiving', 'debt', 'as', 'well', 'increasing', 'inability', 'even', 'structure', 'even', 'imagine', 'more', 'hopeful', 'future', 'How', 'sad', 'Dominique', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'seven', 'years', 'murder', 'yet', 'how', 'fiercely', 'relentlessly', 'would', 'continue', 'fight', 'hope', 'Indeed', 'how', 'fierce', 'beautiful', 'film', 'call', 'resistance', 'injustices', 'general', 'devastatingly', 'specific', '****']",The Agronomist

When he talks, his smiles, glances, and movements are really very absorbing, and the man was a very interesting and wise person.  It's almost odd to imagine someone like him arising out of the ashes of such a tumultuous country as Haiti.Haiti itself strikes an interesting character, being as it were one rife with violence and turmoil.  This documentary analyzes the forty years Dominique experienced from behind a microphone and shows not only the personal tension, but the geopolitical issues (let's just say this movie isn't very nice to people like Presidents Reagan and Clinton).The first part of the movie itself is most important because it spends time showing the absolute need for media in order to maintain human rights.  It's difficult to watch because it shows how much we take our media for granted and how shortsighted our media really are.  While we bother our comfortable heads with issues of ""objectively"" representing ""everyone's needs"", some people are struggling to make sure their voice is heard and getting killed over it.  Maybe it's a good thing we have nothing really to talk about, because it shows we're not in these people's situations.Anyways, a very powerful and inspiring documentary indeed, and one that's pretty well done despite the poor video quality.  The background music and the focus on Jean Dominique's face make it very comfortable and friendly even as he's helping to reveal the issues he had to deal with.

893260,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0007XBLK8,Roland E. Zwick,"[22, 23]","Jonathan Demme's ""The Agronomist"" is a documentary about Jean Dominique, the Haitian civil rights leader and radio journalist who was gunned down by unknown assassins on April 3, 2000.  A passionate believer in a free and open press, Dominique founded Radio Haiti in the early 1960's and became know as the ""voice of the people"" for over four decades of that nation's turbulent, strife-torn history.  Through a succession of coups and counter-coups that seemed to forever rock the country, Dominique  remained committed to securing freedom for the citizens of his beloved island nation, even if that meant having to do so as a frequent political exile living in the United States.  That his own life ended tragically - as is so often the case when brave individuals step out to try to make the world a better place - is of less importance than that people of goodwill pick up the banner and carry forth his message of social justice and equality for all people. Demme has done just that by putting together this inspiring and thought provoking documentary.In constructing his film, Demme has chosen to rely primarily on the many interviews Dominique gave over the course of his lifetime.  Thus, even though Dominique is dead, we are able to hear his story in his own words, a distinct advantage for those of us who knew little or nothing about the man and what he accomplished prior to our seeing this movie.  We learn firsthand of all the dreams and fears, hopes and disappointments that came to define this one individual who truly made a difference in his world.  In addition to these interviews, Demme also provides insights from Dominique's supportive wife and family as well as from some of the common folk in Haiti who were inspired by Dominique's vision.As the movie unfolds, Demme provides us with a well-delineated history of Haiti in the last half century, showing us the political turmoil and human suffering that have, sadly, come to define life in that benighted country.  This includes the installation and overthrow of both Duvalier regimes (""Papa Doc"" and ""Baby Doc""), the election then overthrow of Aristide by the forces of Cedras, then the return to power of Aristide at the hands of an international force led by the United States.  The saddest part of the movie comes near the end with the realization that, even with a democratically elected government in place, life has not become appreciably better for the average Haitian, for the violence, suppression and government corruption seem as intense today as at any time in Haiti's past.Still, despite these many setbacks, Dominique's vision of a world where every person is free to speak his mind without fear continues to flourish in the hearts of men and women everywhere.
