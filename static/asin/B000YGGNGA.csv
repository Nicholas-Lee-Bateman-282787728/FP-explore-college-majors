She stays in New York and finds big success.I am surprised by the negativity around most of the comments. It's true that ""Blonde Ambition"" is not Oscar material, but you should already know that before watching it.Jessica Simpson's character is cute and likable. The plot is actually not bad. It is funny and light hearted. I really enjoyed watching Katie and Ben being together. Unlike other romantic comedies, office politics get a big part of the film. And have I mentioned that Freddy is really hilarious?""Blonde Ambition"" made me smile and I felt happy after watching it. I think it is a great brain off romantic comedy. The only complaint I have is the constant un-subtle product advertising, which gets annoying and out of place at times.",5,Blonde Ambition,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,883,"['film', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'going', 'New', 'York', 'surprise', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'only', 'find', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'dumping', 'New', 'York', 'big', 'success.I', 'am', 'surprised', 'negativity', 'most', 'comments', 'true', 'Blonde', 'Ambition', 'not', 'Oscar', 'material', 'should', 'already', 'know', 'watching', 'it.Jessica', 'Simpson', 'character', 'cute', 'likable', 'plot', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'funny', 'light', 'hearted', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Katie', 'Ben', 'being', 'together', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'office', 'politics', 'get', 'big', 'part', 'film', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Freddy', 'really', 'hilarious', 'Blonde', 'Ambition', 'made', 'smile', 'felt', 'happy', 'watching', 'think', 'great', 'brain', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'constant', 'un-subtle', 'product', 'advertising', 'annoying', 'place', 'times']",N/A
1119678,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000YGGNGA,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[1, 2]","I thought critics were just picking on Jessica Simpson when ""Blonde Ambition"" was universally panned, but after (barely) sitting through this turkey, I conceded, and have to say this is one of the dumbest films I've watched since ""Dude, Where's My Car?""While Simpson's performance is cringe-worthy, the blame isn't entirely her's. The script, by John Cohen, Matthew Flanagan, and David McHugh, tries to combine elements of ""Working Girl"" and ""The Dukes of Hazard"", with all the finesse of a bull in a china shop. 'Clever' touches, like using Groucho Marx character names as clients, having co-star Rachael Leigh Cook (""Josie and the Pussycats"") audition for a non-musical version of ""Cats"", and tossing in a cameo by Penny Marshall (complete with a reference to Milwaukee, the setting of ""Laverne and Shirley) are dumb, rather than funny. Add to this Scott Marshall's ham-handed direction, and you have all the elements for a train wreck of a film.The sad thing is, some wonderful talent is wasted. Larry Miller manages to make the most out of a poorly-written role as Simpson's boss, but Luke Wilson and Penelope Ann Miller (who both deserve better) are reduced to grinning and mugging, as the 'true love' and 'villain'. Willie Nelson and Drew Fuller are little more than window dressing; only Andy Dick seems a perfect 'fit', as idiotic as the plot, itself!As for Jessica...if ""Blonde Ambition"" is any indication, she'd better stick to singing!",1,For Die-Hard Simpson Fans ONLY!,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,1446,"['thought', 'critics', 'were', 'just', 'picking', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'when', 'Blonde', 'Ambition', 'was', 'universally', 'panned', 'barely', 'sitting', 'turkey', 'conceded', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'dumbest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car', 'Simpson', 'performance', 'cringe-worthy', 'blame', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'script', 'John', 'Cohen', 'Matthew', 'Flanagan', 'David', 'McHugh', 'combine', 'elements', 'Working', 'Girl', 'Dukes', 'Hazard', 'finesse', 'bull', 'china', 'shop', 'touches', 'using', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'character', 'names', 'clients', 'having', 'co-star', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'audition', 'non-musical', 'version', 'Cats', 'tossing', 'cameo', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'complete', 'reference', 'Milwaukee', 'setting', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'are', 'dumb', 'rather', 'funny', 'Add', 'Scott', 'Marshall', 'ham-handed', 'direction', 'have', 'elements', 'train', 'wreck', 'film.The', 'sad', 'thing', 'wonderful', 'talent', 'wasted', 'Larry', 'Miller', 'make', 'most', 'poorly-written', 'role', 'Simpson', 'boss', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'who', 'deserve', 'better', 'are', 'reduced', 'grinning', 'mugging', ""'true"", 'love', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Drew', 'Fuller', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'window', 'dressing', 'only', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'perfect', ""'fit"", 'as', 'idiotic', 'plot', 'Jessica', 'Blonde', 'Ambition', 'indication', ""'d"", 'better', 'stick', 'singing']",N/A

It's an interesting thing to do and I've seen some really fine movies, such as ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a couple nights ago. Last night's movie was ""Blond Ambition."" Well, it was at the other end of the spectrum: an almost complete waste of time.""Blond Ambition"" was one of the worst movies I can remember seeing in a long time. Calling it a B movie would be overrating it. I'm trying to think of something good and Jessica Simpson comes to mind. She's a pleasant and fine-looking woman and I enjoy watching her, much as I used to enjoy watching Marilyn Monroe. Acting? Not really. She's just walking around being herself, and that's nice. I was somehow hoping the movie was a fun-filled comedy, but I guess that was asking too much. The rest of the cast is just embarrassing, but it fits. The story (small town girl makes it big in NYC) is moronic so why shouldn't it have bad acting? If it were only funny. But it isn't funny, it's pathetic. Maybe this movie needs to be seen in a crowded theater, or maybe it needs a laugh track  I'm trying to picture this movie as being so bad that it's good. Nope, it just doesn't work. I guess it's just a badly constructed comedy that completely fails to go over, except that I enjoyed watching Ms Simpson.Well, what can I say? I notice that it received a number of five-star reviews. Five stars? You've gotta be kidding! The reviewers' taste must be all in their mouths! Well, to each his/her own. And in defense of those misguided people, I must admit that I have enjoyed a few badly-acted B movies with  extremely poor story lines and thoroughly enjoyed them. ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" comes to mind. I've watched it at least 4 or 5 times and I'll watch it again. But no, not ""Blond Ambition."" Once is more than enough. This movie deserves one star, but I'm going to give it two because of Ms Simpson.Gary Peterson",2,"Atrocious Movie, Except For Ms Simpson.",1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,1979,"['have', 'habit', 'watching', 'late', 'night', 'movies', 'get', 'movies', 'DVD', 'bargain', 'racks', 'mostly', 'Ross', 'Stores', 'interesting', 'thing', 'do', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', 'fine', 'movies', 'such', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'couple', 'nights', 'ago', 'Last', 'night', 'movie', 'was', 'Blond', 'Ambition', 'Well', 'was', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'almost', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'Blond', 'Ambition', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'can', 'remember', 'seeing', 'long', 'time', 'Calling', 'B', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'overrating', ""'m"", 'trying', 'think', 'something', 'good', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'mind', 'pleasant', 'fine-looking', 'woman', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'much', 'used', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Acting', 'Not', 'really', 'just', 'walking', 'around', 'being', 'nice', 'was', 'somehow', 'hoping', 'movie', 'was', 'fun-filled', 'comedy', 'guess', 'was', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'embarrassing', 'story', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'big', 'NYC', 'moronic', 'so', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'acting', 'were', 'only', 'funny', ""n't"", 'funny', 'pathetic', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'crowded', 'theater', 'maybe', 'laugh', 'track', ""'m"", 'trying', 'picture', 'movie', 'being', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'Nope', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'guess', 'just', 'badly', 'constructed', 'comedy', 'completely', 'go', 'over', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Ms', 'Simpson.Well', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'notice', 'received', 'number', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'Five', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'kidding', 'reviewers', 'taste', 'must', 'be', 'mouths', 'Well', 'own', 'defense', 'misguided', 'people', 'must', 'admit', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'few', 'badly-acted', 'B', 'movies', 'extremely', 'poor', 'story', 'lines', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'High', 'School', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'least', '4', '5', 'times', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'not', 'Blond', 'Ambition', 'Once', 'more', 'enough', 'movie', 'one', 'star', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'two', 'Ms', 'Simpson.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

Don't base your views on what other people think because everyone has different opinions to what they think is a good film.

There's no new ideas in ""Blonde Ambition"". And I don't usually expect or demand that a movie should be innovative, but it's hard for me to remember when I last saw a movie so full of clich&eacute;s.Jessica Simpson goes to New York to surprise her boyfriend. But the surprise is on her (certainly to the surprise of nobody in the audience) when she literally finds another woman in his bed. When helping her would-be-actress friend to deliver mail to some big company, the scheming female vice president of the company notices how stupid and easily manipulated she is and realizes she can use her to get the president thrown out and take his position. Meanwhile, she meets Ben who works in the mail room and fall in love with him.Simpson is miscast, looking much to plastic for an innocent small town girl, but the rest of the cast do their best with the material they've been given.

For the first half hour it was pretty cool, like how she falls into the hole with the bike and then just lies there having a conversation with the dude, but after that all personality, flavor, and attention to detail disappears leaving all characters and situations one-dimensional. Most scenes in the romantic plotline lack context and feel like re-enecatments from other movies. They actually use the ""romantic lead 1 sees romantic lead 2 hugging someone out of context and jumps to the wrong conclusion"" thing.
