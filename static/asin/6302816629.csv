Harrison Ford stars as a lawyer, Rusty, who's been carrying on a hot affair with Carolyn Polhemus (the glamorous Greta Scacchi) She cut off the affair because he wasn't furthering his career... then she is found terribly ravaged and murdered. Who did it?The late Raul Julia as well as Brian Dennehy turn in excellent performances as Rusty's colleagues. Bonnie Bedelia stars as Rusty's heartbroken,mentally ill wife. His affair has made her into the broken shell of a woman. The movie glamorizes Ford's passionate affair with Scacchi. The love scenes are incredibly sensual.

339025,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302816629,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Legal dramas run a real large risk of becoming very `television movie' like, simply because stations like TNT thrive on countless courtroom dramas that basically emulate legal films to a T.  It takes something special to transcend that comparison and truly stand alone as a cinematic feature and not a `familiar' regurgitation of the same thing I saw Tuesday night on `Law & Order' or, worse yet, `Matlock'.  Sadly, `Presumed Innocent' does not do that.  This is actually a pretty good movie, with a sharp script and some stellar performances, and the ambiguous `who did it' theme running from start to finish really does hold up, right until that final twist you didn't see coming takes over.But, when all is said and done, this feels like an episode of `Matlock' with curse words and a better looking cast.`Presumed Innocent' tells the story of a PA with a dark secret.  He has been carrying a torch for a self-serving lawyer at his firm who seduced him for personal gain and then dropped him when he wouldn't play along.  His heart stuck up in her web of deceit, he longs for her up until the night she is murdered and he gets assigned the case.  As the clues start to pile up, he finds that he is the prime suspect and soon his career is in shambles as he is arrested for her murder.Did he do it?All involved to an excellent job of keeping that question legitimate.  Harrison Ford plays Rusty with this overwhelming question mark lingering over his head.  You will form your opinion (I concluded that he did it) but really, that ending is still a heavy hitter when all is revealed.  BTW, I'm not saying that I'm right or wrong, I'm just saying that it was my assumption while watching.  Anyways, the impact of the finale really depends on that question lingering, and it does quite effectively.Still, I can't help but shrug at the overall feel of the film, since I get the same feeling while watching `Law & Order: SVU'.Alas, it's still a solid experience.  Watch out for Bonnie Bedelia, who plays Ford's wife.  She burns slowly, letting those embers smolder until the film draws to a close and she becomes truly entrancing.

Yes, the premise is that bad and hard to swallow, but as long as everything else reigns supreme, such veracity can be safely ignored. This is one of the great Harrison Ford performances, although it is very rare for him to give less than a good one, and he shows the ability to do serious films outside of the usual action-adventure genre. Raul Julia is as masterful as the defending lawyer, and it's nice to see Brian Dennehy to do his typical SOB performance. Bonnie Bedelia is a darling as usual. I must say, I never saw the twist coming at the end, so that was very unpredictable. However, it is a nice one.

Not only is he a great mystery writer, but his stories translate to the screen quite well. Up there with John Grisham, and for many of the same reasons: he's an attorney, too.Rusty Sabich (Harrison Ford) is an assistant in the prosecuting attorney's office, and probably the best. What's more, his boss Raymond Horgan (Brian Dennehy) is up for re-election and has his mind on more than prosecuting crimes. So when another attorney in their office, Carolyn Polhemas (Greta Scacchi), is found brutally murdered, Horgan assigns Rusty to the case, even though he'd rather not. Why would he rather not? He'd been having an affair with Carolyn, which didn't take long to come out.I'm not going to give much of the plot away, but I do want to acknowledge two actors I like very much who show up in this film, and who subsequently worked together on ""The West Wing.""  John Spencer (aka Leo McGarrity) plays Detective Lipranzer, asked to join in the investigation by Rusty because he is a friend who can be trusted. And working for the defense attorney is Jamie Kemp (Bradley Whitford, aka Josh Lyman). What's interesting is that both actors were recognized first by their voices. I had not thought about it before, but the West Wing men generally have quite recognizable voices.Yes, there is an arrest and a trial. But is the killer caught?

It made a pretty stunning impression, but there were a couple nagging flaws. Now,  watching it again so many years later, all the meaningful shots are well  timed.Harrison Ford is the star of this well-crafted thriller, but  nearly everybody shines to amazing degrees. Prosecutorial politics are the  backdrop, and the viewer comes to realize that the legal community of the  criminal justice system is a very small world. This was the first time I  saw the &quot;Ford glower,&quot; an expression that he exaggerates to  ridiculous extremes in the amazingly glum &quot;Random Hearts.&quot; Here,  he modulates the expression to perfection. Everybody in this movie is  corrupt, except for Ford (he's merely an adulterer), but his performance  makes him believable as a very likely suspect in the murder of his  co-worker.Inept prosecution combines with Raul Julia's impeccable  defense to make for hugely entertaining courtroom scenes. Paul Winfield's  acerbic judge adds greatly to the courtroom scenes. The sets are  magnificent, shifting mood for each location. Pakula paces his story well  (except for the final confession scene, which is ridiculously drawn out),  though the &quot;red herring&quot; is too confusing on initial viewings to  make convincing sense.It's a great rental, but, in a movie where just  about everybody looks bad, racial minorities seem to be especially corrupt  or inept.

339031,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,6302816629,California Dreaming,"[0, 2]","They say that a picture is worth a thousand words.  If only the director of this film would have kept this in mind.Without giving too much away, there comes a point in this film where the audience knows what happened.  The look in an actor's eyes is surely enough to explain who killed whom.  But the director didn't trust that the audience would understand -- or perhaps he had some sample audience screen the film before release, and that audience said they were confused -- and so the director decided that he needed another actor to explain all the dirty details, just to be sure.I read a really funny web page one time written by either a screenwriter, or at least a lover of film.  On that page, he discussed something that he called the ""Idiot Lecture.""  This would be the speech in a film where the perpetrator explains everything in detail to a prop actor, where that prop actor's sole job is to stand there, listen, and be a fill-in for the audience, just to convey information.  You remember that prop actor in TV shows such as ""Batman,"" say just before Robin is going to get cut in half with a saw, and the evil guy -- perhaps The Joker -- is just about to do that cutting.  But as you probably already know, film is a far different medium than literature.  In books, the author can explain things through prose -- or poetry if he wants -- to the reader.  In film, you either have action or dialog; there's not much else.  Therefore, sometimes, all the director or writer can come up with is the unfortunate ""Idiot Lecture.""  And this lecture is always very awkward.  And it surely is awkward and unnecessary, in ""Presumed Innocent.""And this is really too bad, as this film, up until this point, is a first-class thriller.  I really liked the performances and the story, and I liked the fact that there were so many people in this film who had the motive to be the killer.  Heck, the audience almost wants to kill the gal as well!  But I didn't have a clue until towards the end, where I suddenly thought to myself, ""Self!  I know who the killer is!"" and then he finally gave himself away through the aforementioned lecture element.  (Note:  I use ""he"" as an indefinite pronoun to maintain grammar and brevity here.)But this is not the only issue with the screenplay.  Once again, without giving away a ""spoiler,"" there is something that the killer does that would be out of character for that killer, after learning how careful the killer had done his planning.  Let's just say that our killer would have been much more careful with crime cleanup.  So, in addition to the dreaded ""Idiot Lecture,"" we also have inconsistent character behavior here.Well, this picture is worth a thousand words.

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[4, 5]","Seldom is the incomparable Harrison Ford in a project that doesn't score, and this 1990 thriller, adapted from author Scott's Turow's best-selling book, had audiences flocking and critics raving. Little wonder, given that director Alan J. Pakula historically goes for the intellect (""All the President's Men"") and manages to get the most from his actors. Here, Ford is deputy prosecutor Rusty Sabich who lives to regret allowing himself to be seduced by a stunningly but venomously beautiful fellow prosecutor (Gretta Scacchi). The self-serving and manipulative lady turns up brutally murdered, and circumstantial evidence rooted in his affair with the deceased points to Sabich as the prime suspect. As Sabich's meticulous and ever-so-ethical attorney, the late Raul Julia is brilliant as the craftsman who dismantles the state's case because of shoddy investigative work and despite his client being set up by his own boss and second main suspect (Brian Dennehy). Despite his exoneration, Sabich's career is nonetheless destroyed and his family life in on thin ice. As Sabich's long-suffering but devoted and faithful wife, Bonnie Bedalia is a fascinating study piece, and the punch she KO's her husband with may not be so much a shock as is her monologue at film's end. ""Presumed Innocent"" remains a classy thriller that, with Pakula's intelligent guidance, keeps us guessing throughout while, at the same time, maintaining the possibility that the accused actually did it.

Based on Scott Turow's best-selling novel of the same name (his first), it relies on a well-coordinated directorial effort by Alan J. Pakula (Sophie's Choice 1982, All the President's Men 1976, Klute 1971, etc.), a fine script by Frank Pierson (whose credits include Cool Hand Luke 1967, Dog Day Afternoon 1975, A Star Is Born 1976, etc.), and an experienced, talented and well-directed cast headed by Harrison Ford, Brian Dennehy, Raul Julia, Bonnie Bedelia, Greta Scacchi and Paul Winfield.Ford plays Rusty Sabich, a prosecutor compromised by his sexual obsession with a fellow prosecutor, Caroline Polhemus (Scacchi) who is found murdered as the film opens.  We see her in flashback as a conniving mantrap who uses her wiles to further her career.  Sabich is assigned to the case by his boss, Raymond Horgan (Dennehy) who is up for reelection.  Sabich would like to recuse himself but Horgan demands that he take the case and get the perp ""yesterday"" otherwise they will all be out a job because he will lose the election.  Bedelia, looking particularly beguiling, plays Sabich's sexually frustrated and deeply hurt wife, Barbara.When the election is lost the new prosecutors arrest Sabich and charge him with murder.  He is defended by the very smooth Raul Julia who plays defense attorney Sandy Stern.  Paul Winfield, in a somewhat flamboyant style, plays Judge Larren Lyttle.Because Scott Turow knows the way the law works in practice as well as in theory, he having been a lawyer before he became a best-selling writer, we are treated to wood paneled intrigues and courtroom theatrics that have the unmistakable feel of authenticity.  The dialogue is veracious and the character cross-currents vividly real.  Ford gives what I think is one of his best performances as a man tormented by his infidelity and caught in a vise of circumstance largely stemming from that infidelity.  Dennehy is a big-mouthed and big-headed politician in the familiar Windy City style.  Raul Julia's Sandy Stern is cosmopolitan and brilliant, cynical and slick, a kind of Latin Johnny Cochran.  Bedelia, whom I recall best as Shirley Muldowney in Heart Like a Wheel (1983) manages a delicate (and slightly unbelievable) persona with just the right amount of forbearance so that when the surprise ending comes we almost believe it.I say ""almost,"" but you might want to judge for yourself.See this for Harrison Ford who plays a foolish and morally compromised man with just the sort of right stuff and disarming vulnerability we've come to expect from one of Hollywood's most popular leading men.",4,Excellent criminal law thriller,1061596800,"08 23, 2003",2003,2658,"['thriller', 'top', 'notch', 'kind', 'movie', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'Based', 'Scott', 'Turow', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'first', 'well-coordinated', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'Sophie', 'Choice', '1982', 'President', 'Men', '1976', 'Klute', '1971', 'etc', 'fine', 'script', 'Frank', 'Pierson', 'credits', 'include', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', '1967', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', '1975', 'Star', 'Is', 'Born', '1976', 'etc', 'experienced', 'talented', 'well-directed', 'cast', 'headed', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'Paul', 'Winfield.Ford', 'Rusty', 'Sabich', 'prosecutor', 'compromised', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'fellow', 'prosecutor', 'Caroline', 'Polhemus', 'Scacchi', 'who', 'found', 'murdered', 'film', 'see', 'flashback', 'conniving', 'mantrap', 'who', 'wiles', 'further', 'career', 'Sabich', 'assigned', 'case', 'boss', 'Raymond', 'Horgan', 'Dennehy', 'who', 'up', 'reelection', 'Sabich', 'would', 'like', 'recuse', 'Horgan', 'take', 'case', 'get', 'perp', 'yesterday', 'otherwise', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'job', 'will', 'lose', 'election', 'Bedelia', 'looking', 'particularly', 'beguiling', 'Sabich', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'deeply', 'hurt', 'wife', 'Barbara.When', 'election', 'lost', 'new', 'prosecutors', 'arrest', 'Sabich', 'charge', 'murder', 'defended', 'very', 'smooth', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'who', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Sandy', 'Stern', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'somewhat', 'flamboyant', 'style', 'Judge', 'Larren', 'Lyttle.Because', 'Scott', 'Turow', 'way', 'law', 'practice', 'as', 'well', 'theory', 'having', 'been', 'lawyer', 'became', 'best-selling', 'writer', 'are', 'treated', 'wood', 'paneled', 'intrigues', 'courtroom', 'theatrics', 'have', 'unmistakable', 'feel', 'authenticity', 'dialogue', 'veracious', 'character', 'cross-currents', 'vividly', 'real', 'Ford', 'what', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'man', 'tormented', 'infidelity', 'caught', 'vise', 'circumstance', 'largely', 'stemming', 'infidelity', 'Dennehy', 'big-mouthed', 'big-headed', 'politician', 'familiar', 'Windy', 'City', 'style', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'Sandy', 'Stern', 'cosmopolitan', 'brilliant', 'cynical', 'slick', 'kind', 'Latin', 'Johnny', 'Cochran', 'Bedelia', 'whom', 'recall', 'best', 'Shirley', 'Muldowney', 'Heart', 'Wheel', '1983', 'delicate', 'slightly', 'unbelievable', 'persona', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'forbearance', 'when', 'surprise', 'ending', 'almost', 'believe', 'it.I', 'say', 'almost', 'might', 'want', 'judge', 'yourself.See', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'who', 'foolish', 'morally', 'compromised', 'man', 'just', 'sort', 'right', 'stuff', 'disarming', 'vulnerability', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'popular', 'leading', 'men']",N/A

Admittedly, I'm dense, but I was floored when the killer was ""revealed"" at the end of this excellent courtroom thriller.  As they say:  ""Hell hath no fury. . .""  But I digress.Harrison Ford plays a top DA lieutenant to an embattled District Attorney fighting for his electoral life (Brian Dennehy is one talented actor).  When a beautiful prosecutor in the DA's office is brutally murdered, Ford's character is assigned the case, but there's more to this assignment than meets the eye--Ford and his coworker (Greta Scacchi) had been having a torrid love affair.  Consequently, Ford obstructs his own investigation--where his DNA and other evidence are all over the crime scene--until a new DA is sworn in and lowers the boom, charging Ford with murder.  Ford proclaims his innocence, his wife (a bodacious Bonnie Bedelia) is incensed, and a grand drama of a trial ensues, led by Ford's colorful defense attorney, Raul Julia.  Even though there's circumstantial evidence galore, it turns out there was more than one prosecutor having fun with the vivacious Scacchi; thus the judicial waters are muddied, and PRESUMED INNOCENT races headlong to its jaw-dropping conclusion.Ford is solid, while Bedelia is very convincing as the wounded spouse.  Julia is fun to watch; Scacchi looks good and is delightfully wicked; Dennehy is just plain grand.

I thought the first half of the film was rather slow and tedious, at some points unnecessarily drawn out and not all details were pertinent to the plot. I thought also the acting was spotty, good at points, but at points it was more like the actors were going through the motions of a typical crime drama. When Rusty enlists Sandy Stern (Raul Julia) as his attorney, the film's momentum hits another gear and the story really builds until its conclusion, and Julia does an excellent job as Rusty's top-notch lawyer determined to save his client.Presumed Innocent is a decent crime drama, effective at keeping you waiting in suspense.

Second, great casting and acting, from top to bottom.  Harrison Ford is at the top of his game, perfect in his range of emotions and fitting into the role so well you have to struggle to remember he's acting.  Likewise, Bonnie Bedelia is a terrific actress.  My generation mainly thinks of her as John McClane's wife in Die Hard I and II (bring her back for IV!) and my parents' generation thinks of her as Ruby in ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" but we all need to see her in this role where she shines in her ability.I also must commend the penultimate scene of the movie, Bonnie Bedelia's ""The Destroyer is destroyed"" monologue.  Wow, what a speech!  What a perfect reaction from Rusty Sabich! ((gasping) ""Saved?"")  Sometimes one or two scenes make a movie.  Think, for example, of the Walker/Hopper and the Gandolfini/Arquette scenes in ""True Romance.""  Sometimes, however, a movie that is otherwise strong in all its parts -- acting-writing-directing -- is made even stronger by a certain scene.

339051,A9TG2NFA614S9,6302816629,John F. Rooney,"[3, 3]","In ""Presumed Innocent"" Deputy Prosecutor Rusty Sabich (Harrison Ford) has a torrid love affair with a colleague, prosecutor Carolyn Polhemus, who turns up as the victim of a sadistic rape murder. Chief Prosecutor Ray Horgan (excellently delineated by Brian Dennehy) puts Rusty in charge of the investigation, but Horgan, in the middle of a reelection campaign, doesn't think his deputy is putting as much zeal as he should into finding the murderer. Rusty's friend, detective Lipranzer (Lip) thinks Rusty is obstructing and impeding the investigation. When Horgan loses the election to his opponent Nico Della Guardia (nicknamed Delay), the tables are turned, and Rusty himself is accused of the murder by Nico and his prosecutor sidekick Tommy Molto who have amassed a lot of circumstantial evidence pointing to Rusty.Until his encounter with Carolyn, Rusty was a pillar of rectitude and high principles, but he became so obsessed and driven by her charms that he didn't see the devious side of her. The Carolyn sections are shown in long flashbacks that reveal her as a schemer and opportunist who was romantically involved with several key participants. Horgan turns on his former assistant and says, ""You always had the cork in too tight. We all saw that. When you blew, you blew.""The last part of the film is a courtroom drama in which Raul Julia plays Rusty's suave defense lawyer, and Paul Winfield plays the outspoken, no-nonsense judge. It's an exciting case to watch with many twists and turns. Rusty's moody wife Barbara stands behind him even though she was incensed by his infidelity.There's a lot about a missing bribery file that turns out to be a crucial element as does a missing glass with Rusty's fingerprints. The theme throughout is that the case against Rusty is a set-up, a frame-up.This is a very faithful and absorbing rendering of Scott Turow's best seller with all of the essential elements of the suspenseful book retained.

339052,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,6302816629,"John ""MovieAddict""","[2, 3]","Harrison Ford is good at the everyman roles because he strikes you as an everyman. One of my sister's (many, many, uncountable number of) friends met Ford on a beach in America sometime last year; they talked for a while as they sat on the beach. Ford was tired of being harrassed by rabid fans and he just wanted someone to confide in as a normal person might do.I think that's the key to so many of his best roles. Even when he played a deranged psycho killer in &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; he seemed like Average John Smith. And, in his most famous - and best - role, as Dr. Henry &quot;Indiana&quot; Jones, he was still the everyman college professor who happened to be a superhero archaeologist when called into action. And even then he was a reluctant hero, not exactly like &quot;Superman&quot; but more of a &quot;Batman&quot; or &quot;Spider-Man&quot; or Jack Sparrow; a hero not necessarily eager to help out, but a hero who knew it was his destiny to do so and carried out what he had to do with some sort of dry humor necessary to keep the character alive.Harry's an assistant state attorney in &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; -  charged for the murder of a beautiful young woman who used to be a mistress and who was recently found dead, slaughtered by someone who left behind little clues. And what little clues that were left behind all point to him as the murderer.Rusty (Ford) is happily married to Barbara (Bonnie Bedalia), but he's been having an on-the-side romance with Carolyn (Greta Scacchi). She stopped the affair before it got too far, and that is the courtroom prosecutors' motive for Rusty. His phone bills indicate that he called her the same day she was murdered, and at the scene of the crime was found a glass stained with his fingerprints and his own semen.Evidence like this would throw a man right into jail, but Rusty has a great defense lawyer in Sandy Stern (the late Raul Julia), who is confident to prove that Rusty is not the murderer. But if this is the truth, then how does all the evidence point directly to him?The film is based on the novel by Scott Turow, and its adaptation makes you wish that the filmmakers behind all of Grisham's books would get it right, too. But in all fairness, and as much as I enjoy Grisham's writing, he's typically thin on actual plots, and it is his writing style that intices the reader and draws him in so you are unable to stop turning the pages. Perhaps that is why the big-screen adaptations always fail -- film is an entirely different medium than literature, which too many Hollywood executives forget these days.Crichton novels generally make good because Michael Crichton is an extraordinary researcher, able to make the most insane plots seem utterly real. Stephen King, on the other hand, relies on old horror genre cliches in his writing that typically do not translate well to the screen (I mean no offense to these writers, they may be good at what they do, but the fact is that some novels should not be given screen treatments).Scott Turow's controversial novel has been done justice. This is a smart, suspenseful, tightly-woven mystery/thriller with a strong plot and characters who seem quite real and attachable. It feels like an older film than it is -- not in terms of technology but rather in terms of feeling. Hitchcock couldn't have done a better job with this material. Well...maybe.The only real problem with this movie is Harrison Ford's haircut (he looks like he stuck his head under an active lawnmower), but that's an entirely different story.",4,Presumed Good.,1070409600,"12 3, 2003",2003,3549,"['Harrison', 'Ford', 'good', 'everyman', 'everyman', 'One', 'sister', 'many', 'many', 'uncountable', 'number', 'friends', 'met', 'Ford', 'beach', 'America', 'sometime', 'last', 'year', 'talked', 'while', 'sat', 'beach', 'Ford', 'was', 'tired', 'being', 'harrassed', 'rabid', 'fans', 'just', 'wanted', 'someone', 'confide', 'normal', 'person', 'might', 'do.I', 'think', 'key', 'so', 'many', 'best', 'roles', 'Even', 'when', 'played', 'deranged', 'psycho', 'killer', 'quot', 'What', 'Beneath', 'quot', 'seemed', 'like', 'Average', 'John', 'Smith', 'most', 'famous', 'best', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Henry', 'quot', 'Indiana', 'quot', 'Jones', 'was', 'still', 'everyman', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'superhero', 'archaeologist', 'when', 'called', 'action', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'not', 'exactly', 'quot', 'Superman', 'quot', 'more', 'quot', 'Batman', 'quot', 'quot', 'Spider-Man', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'hero', 'not', 'necessarily', 'eager', 'help', 'out', 'hero', 'who', 'knew', 'was', 'destiny', 'do', 'so', 'carried', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'sort', 'dry', 'humor', 'necessary', 'keep', 'character', 'alive.Harry', 'assistant', 'state', 'attorney', 'quot', 'Presumed', 'Innocent', 'quot', 'charged', 'murder', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'mistress', 'who', 'was', 'recently', 'found', 'dead', 'slaughtered', 'someone', 'who', 'left', 'behind', 'little', 'clues', 'what', 'little', 'clues', 'were', 'left', 'point', 'murderer.Rusty', 'Ford', 'happily', 'married', 'Barbara', 'Bonnie', 'Bedalia', 'been', 'having', 'on-the-side', 'romance', 'Carolyn', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'stopped', 'affair', 'got', 'too', 'far', 'courtroom', 'prosecutors', 'motive', 'Rusty', 'phone', 'bills', 'indicate', 'called', 'same', 'day', 'was', 'murdered', 'scene', 'crime', 'was', 'found', 'glass', 'stained', 'fingerprints', 'own', 'semen.Evidence', 'would', 'throw', 'man', 'right', 'jail', 'Rusty', 'great', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'Sandy', 'Stern', 'late', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'who', 'confident', 'prove', 'Rusty', 'not', 'murderer', 'truth', 'then', 'how', 'evidence', 'point', 'directly', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Scott', 'Turow', 'adaptation', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'Grisham', 'books', 'would', 'get', 'right', 'too', 'fairness', 'as', 'much', 'enjoy', 'Grisham', 'writing', 'typically', 'thin', 'actual', 'plots', 'writing', 'style', 'reader', 'are', 'unable', 'stop', 'turning', 'pages', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'big-screen', 'adaptations', 'always', 'fail', 'film', 'entirely', 'different', 'medium', 'literature', 'too', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'executives', 'forget', 'days.Crichton', 'novels', 'generally', 'make', 'good', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'extraordinary', 'researcher', 'able', 'make', 'most', 'insane', 'plots', 'seem', 'utterly', 'real', 'Stephen', 'King', 'other', 'hand', 'relies', 'old', 'horror', 'genre', 'cliches', 'writing', 'typically', 'do', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'screen', 'mean', 'offense', 'writers', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'fact', 'novels', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'given', 'screen', 'treatments', '.Scott', 'Turow', 'controversial', 'novel', 'been', 'done', 'justice', 'smart', 'suspenseful', 'tightly-woven', 'mystery/thriller', 'strong', 'plot', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'quite', 'real', 'attachable', 'older', 'film', 'not', 'terms', 'technology', 'rather', 'terms', 'feeling', 'Hitchcock', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'material', 'Well', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'movie', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'haircut', 'stuck', 'head', 'active', 'lawnmower', 'entirely', 'different', 'story']",N/A
339053,A15OXF84G8JKKB,6302816629,Justin Bost,"[11, 11]","These are the issues that are explored in this film, directed by Alan J. Pakula, adapted from the best selling novel by Scott Turow.  It is the story of chief deputy prosecutor Rozat ""Rusty"" Sabich (Ford) in the fictional Kindle County, whose seemingly normal life is shattered by the murder of a female colleague, Carolyn Polhemus (Scacchi).  A colleague with whom he had previously engaged in an affair and whom he had stalked when she had broken off the affair.Any illusions you may have about the integrity of the criminal justice system (in this fictional world) are swept away quickly.  Sabich is coerced into heading the investigation of Polhemus' murder by his boss, prosecuting attorney Raymond Horgan (Dennehy).  That is, until Horgan loses his reelection campaign and new prosecuting attorney Nico Della Guardia (Mardirosian) and his second whip Tommy Molto (Grifasi) charge him with Polhemus' murder.One of the great aspects of this movie is that Sabich, while heading the murder investigation, seems very conflicted about his previous encounters with Polhemus, who we only see in flashback sequences during the film.  We don't know if this is because of his emotional and sexual connection to Polhemus, or because he is the murderer himself.  Suspicions are raised concerning Sabich's guilt throughout the first third of the movie, e.g., his obstruction of his lead investigator Detective Lipranzer (Spencer) by ignoring fingerprint evidence.  This becomes ammunition against him later when he becomes the defendant.Sabich's wife Barbara (Bedelia) throws gasoline on the fire by constantly nettling Rusty about the previous affair, and, most important, Rusty's obsession with Polhemus which even her death could not end.  Barbara tries to reconnect to Rusty during the movie, but it is clear that he deeply hurt her by the affair, and Rusty knows that he has a lot to atone for.The net starts closing around Sabich fairly quickly in the second third of the movie.  Everyone except Lipranzer is ready and willing to believe that Sabich is the murderer.  Luckily, Sabich hires former adversary Sandy Stern (Julia) to defend him.  Stern is an outstanding defense attorney, and his instincts eventually lead to a winning strategy that results in the dismissal of charges against Sabich.  But, as Stern asks Sabich later in the film ""was justice done?""The forensic case that is prepared against Sabich is interesting because it predates the active use of DNA in criminal investigations.  Also, the actions of the medical examiner ""Painless"" Kumagai (Shimono) alternate between the comical and ridiculous.  Nevertheless, the trial that is the centerpiece of the movie is truly engrossing.  The trial judge Larren Lyttle (Winfield) is quite amusing and speaks his mind.What we come to realize by the middle of the film is that political intrigue, blackmail, and sex influence *everyone* in the film.  Anyone even tangentially involved in the case is dirty in some respect.  No one is innocent.  Although you may guess the true identity of the murderer before the trial ends, I promise you will never forget the speech delivered in the denouement of the film.  As Sabich says in the final minute of the film, ""There was a crime.  There was a victim.  And there *is* punishment.""The John Williams score is quite haunting and will stay with you for some time.  All of the principal actors (Ford, Bedelia, Julia, Winfield, Spencer, Mardirosian, Dennehy, Grifasi) deliver powerful performances.  As a bit of trivia, Mardirosian and Grifasi later had guest appearances in the second season of a fledging TV series named Law & Order.  Julia showed that he could play a serious role (unlike other roles in Street Fighter and Addams Family).  As a previous reviewer noted, Julia should have garnered an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, as his performance carries the film from the second act forward.Buy this movie, and appreciate its subtleties with a second and third viewing.  I promise you won't be disappointed. Except of course, by the lack of extras (such as director commentary) on the DVD.  Maybe one day a collector's edition will be released.",5,Was justice served?

Bernabo,"[5, 5]","""Presumed Innocent"" is one of those films where I can never get away from the fact that it is an adaptation of a novel I really enjoyed.  Like one of my other favorite courtroom dramas of recent years, John Grisham's ""The Rainmaker,"" I find myself acutely aware of everything that has been left out in translating Scott Turow's novel to the screen.  For example, I am disappointed every time we have the direct examination regarding the glass with Rusty Sabich's fingerprint on it and the idea of the 13th glass is never brought up.Consequently, I have to think I would have a better appreciation of this film if I had never read the novel.  Certainly the film is able to take advantage of vocal nuances and ambiguous looks to play up the question of the guilt or innocence of Rusty Sabich (Harrison Ford).  I can easier imagine director Alan J. Pakula reshooting scenes so that the performances continue to convince every one in the audience that they are right, whether they think Rusty is guilty or innocent.  Ford's minimalist style, not to mention the buzz hair cut, work well for his character, as does his sexual obsession with the dead woman, the fact of which precludes us from assuming his innocence.  Of course, as an actor Ford has been one of the most heroic figures of our generation, but he amazing sheds that aura for this role.  I do not think he cracks a smile once in this film, which does not give his ""normal"" screen persona a chance to break through.  Along with ""Witness,"" this is one of those films that Ford can point to as proof that he is a legitimate actor and not just a movie star (I also think his work here anticipates how he plays off of his image in ""What Lies Beneath"").The rest of the first-rate cast follows Ford's lead in providing understated performances.  Raul Julia as defense attorney Sandy Stern has to carry the courtroom scenes, which is fine, because the he smooth outclasses the prosecution team of Nico Della Gauardia (Tom Mardirosian) and Tommy Molto (Joe Grifasi); if only he could get his client to stop acting like a lawyer.  His cross-examination of coroner ""Painless"" Kumagai (Sab Shimono) is still one of my favorite scenes in both the book and the film.  Unfortunately most of best scenes for Paul Winfield's Judge Larren Lyttle never made it from the book to the movie.  Bonnie Bedelia as Barbara Sabich has her own tightrope to walk, trying to be supportive of a husband during his murder trial when she cannot forgive him for his affair with the woman who was brutally murdered.  Greta Scacchi as the deceased, Caroline Polhemus, is seen only in flashbacks but amply personifies the woman who manages to be hot and cold at the same time and who used her sexuality to advance her career.  John Spencer as Detective Lipranzer does his usually solid job with the role of the one person who Rusty Sabich can still trust.  Brian Dennehy is perfectly cast as Raymond Horgan, Rusty's boss, who is always trying to catch the political winds in his sails to cover his own behind.As much as I want to take screenwriters Pakula and Frank Pierson to task for the myriad omission neccessitated by a film trying to come in as close to 2 hours in length as possible, I do want to applaud their reworking of the final act in terms of revealing the truth to the viewers.  The key moment, which comes down to a nice combination of a pull back shot and a line of dialogue, is a nice culmination of the film's climate of doubt.  To some degree I actually like the changes the film comes up with for the explanation scene.""Presumed Innocent"" is a compelling courtroom drama because it juggles at the same time not only the question of whether or not the main character will be convicted, but also the key question of whether or not he committed the crime in question.  The success of this film rests entirely on how long it can keep the audience guessing with regards to either one of those questions, especially once one of them is actually answered.  Again, I think those who have not read the novel will like it more than those of us in other column and I would certainly urge you to read the Scott Turow novel if you have not.",4,No one is every completely innocent...,1038096000,"11 24, 2002",2002,4169,"['Presumed', 'Innocent', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'away', 'fact', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'other', 'favorite', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'recent', 'years', 'John', 'Grisham', 'Rainmaker', 'find', 'acutely', 'aware', 'everything', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'translating', 'Scott', 'Turow', 'novel', 'screen', 'example', 'am', 'disappointed', 'time', 'have', 'direct', 'examination', 'regarding', 'glass', 'Rusty', 'Sabich', 'fingerprint', 'idea', '13th', 'glass', 'never', 'brought', 'up.Consequently', 'have', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'appreciation', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'Certainly', 'film', 'able', 'take', 'advantage', 'vocal', 'nuances', 'ambiguous', 'looks', 'play', 'up', 'question', 'guilt', 'innocence', 'Rusty', 'Sabich', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'can', 'easier', 'imagine', 'director', 'Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'reshooting', 'scenes', 'so', 'performances', 'continue', 'convince', 'one', 'audience', 'are', 'right', 'think', 'Rusty', 'guilty', 'innocent', 'Ford', 'minimalist', 'style', 'not', 'mention', 'buzz', 'hair', 'cut', 'work', 'well', 'character', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'dead', 'woman', 'fact', 'precludes', 'assuming', 'innocence', 'course', 'actor', 'Ford', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'heroic', 'figures', 'generation', 'amazing', 'sheds', 'aura', 'role', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'smile', 'once', 'film', 'not', 'give', 'normal', 'screen', 'persona', 'chance', 'break', 'Witness', 'one', 'films', 'Ford', 'can', 'point', 'proof', 'legitimate', 'actor', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'star', 'also', 'think', 'work', 'here', 'how', 'image', 'What', 'Beneath', '.The', 'rest', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'Ford', 'lead', 'providing', 'understated', 'performances', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Sandy', 'Stern', 'carry', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'fine', 'prosecution', 'team', 'Nico', 'Della', 'Gauardia', 'Tom', 'Mardirosian', 'Tommy', 'Molto', 'Joe', 'Grifasi', 'only', 'could', 'get', 'client', 'stop', 'acting', 'lawyer', 'cross-examination', 'coroner', 'Painless', 'Kumagai', 'Sab', 'Shimono', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'book', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'best', 'scenes', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'Judge', 'Larren', 'Lyttle', 'never', 'made', 'book', 'movie', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'Barbara', 'Sabich', 'own', 'tightrope', 'walk', 'trying', 'be', 'supportive', 'husband', 'murder', 'trial', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'forgive', 'affair', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'deceased', 'Caroline', 'Polhemus', 'seen', 'only', 'flashbacks', 'amply', 'personifies', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'hot', 'cold', 'same', 'time', 'who', 'used', 'sexuality', 'advance', 'career', 'John', 'Spencer', 'Detective', 'Lipranzer', 'usually', 'solid', 'job', 'role', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'Rusty', 'Sabich', 'can', 'still', 'trust', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Raymond', 'Horgan', 'Rusty', 'boss', 'who', 'always', 'trying', 'catch', 'political', 'winds', 'sails', 'cover', 'own', 'behind.As', 'much', 'want', 'take', 'screenwriters', 'Pakula', 'Frank', 'Pierson', 'task', 'myriad', 'omission', 'neccessitated', 'film', 'trying', 'come', 'as', 'close', '2', 'hours', 'length', 'possible', 'do', 'want', 'applaud', 'reworking', 'final', 'act', 'terms', 'revealing', 'truth', 'viewers', 'key', 'moment', 'down', 'nice', 'combination', 'pull', 'back', 'shot', 'line', 'dialogue', 'nice', 'culmination', 'film', 'climate', 'doubt', 'degree', 'actually', 'changes', 'film', 'up', 'explanation', 'scene', 'Presumed', 'Innocent', 'compelling', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'question', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'convicted', 'also', 'key', 'question', 'not', 'committed', 'crime', 'question', 'success', 'film', 'entirely', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'regards', 'one', 'questions', 'especially', 'once', 'one', 'actually', 'answered', 'Again', 'think', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'will', 'like', 'more', 'other', 'column', 'would', 'certainly', 'urge', 'read', 'Scott', 'Turow', 'novel', 'have', 'not']",N/A

Suspicions are first directed at those she had prosecuted while assigned to the office's sex crimes division, but there are no signs of forced entry, and Carolyn herself had a rep for pursuing the dangerous side of things.  As the office's no. 2, Sabich is given the case by Horgan.  When Carolyn's case-load is found to contain a ""B file"" - a complaint of official misconduct by a county official - Sabich re-directs the investigation toward the office.  Two other factors enhance the intrigue: the upcoming PA election has Horgan facing off against the ambitious Nico Della Guardia, a former PA who sought to undermine Horgan at every chance while working for him; but the biggest factor is the secret that Rusty himself carries - his own secret affair with Polhemus.  When questions arise about how Sabich handles the evidence - ordering his detective to disregard phone records indicating numerous calls to Carolyn from his own house; ordering the print lab not compare fingerprints taken from a glass found at the scene against those of county employees - Sabich finds himself under suspicion.  Horgan's loss at the polls, putting an enemy at the head of the PA's office, seals Sabich's fate, and the prosecutorial muscle that he once wielded is now directed at him.  Against him is former colleague Della Guardia (called ""Delay"" because of a bed rep for missing deadlines), and Tommy Molto, a zealous prosecutor who'll stop at nothing to prove his case, even if that requires him to make the case credible or (as proves critical) to locate crucial bits of evidence.  Two critical dangers are ironic ones - Ray Horgan and Lipranzer, the detective who does all the police work while Rusty has the case, and follows all of his suspicious orders, like ignoring those phone calls.  Horgan is dangerous because, believing the prosecutor's story, he feels betrayed by Rusty, and enhances the prosecution by claiming that Rusty actively sought to head the case.  Lipranzer is dangerous for the opposite reason - he clearly believes in Rusty's innocence, an irrational gut reaction that won't make points with any jury.  Despite the mindless zeal of the prosecution, the notorious incompetence of its expert witness (a pathologist who entered that field, the joke goes, because a corpse can't sue you for malpractice), the inexplicable disappearance of a critical piece of evidence, the sage advocacy of Rusty's defense attorney Alejandro ""Sandy"" Stern and a judge who does not so much sympathize with Rusty as clearly hate Molto and Della Guardia, Sabich feels condemned.  He is clearly guilty of something.Harrison Ford plays against type as a sap lawyer who's rejected by a beautiful and powerful woman and nearly destroys his own marriage.  It's interesting to see all those characters and places brought to life in Turow's great prose, even if not enlivened that well on the screen.  There's a lot of opportunity that goes wasted here - we never really see Sandy Stern until Sabich is accused (he remains a formidable presence in the book prior to the indictment) and the prosecution itself comes off only as a bunch of hacks (they are, but Turow gives dimension to Tommy Molto's monkish zeal, setting him up as a potential failed rival for Carolyn). Nico's and Rusty's complex relationship is overlooked completely, as well as Rusty's lack of ambition - readers of the book know how Rusty's unwillingness to try unseating Horgan himself critically underlay Carolyn's murder.  The draconian corruption of the Kindle County judicial system and the seemy underworld of the ""Night Saints"" barely merit a mention. Alan Pakula directs as if he could compensate for these gaps by drenching the film in a sort of dreary sloth - everything is slow and downbeat.  Have you read the book?  This movie would be perfect for a list of disappointing novelizations of great books, but ones you have to see.  Even if you read the book (and maybe especially if you have) you should check this out anyway.  Just make sure that you don't read the book first.",3,"Book was better, but catch the flick anyway",1012694400,"02 3, 2002",2002,4472,"['Harrison', 'Ford', 'Rozat', 'Rusty', 'Sabich', 'chief', 'assistant', 'Prosecuting', 'Attorney', 'fictional', 'Kindle', 'County', '13', 'years', 'had', 'essentially', 'run', 'office', 'boss', 'titanic', 'now', 'well-worn', 'Raymond', 'Horgan', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Only', 'weeks', 'vote', 'next', 'turn', 'one', 'Horgan', 'Rusty', 'prosecutors', 'lovely', 'Carolyn', 'Polhemus', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'found', 'brutally', 'fatally', 'beaten', 'apartment', 'Suspicions', 'are', 'first', 'directed', 'had', 'prosecuted', 'assigned', 'office', 'sex', 'crimes', 'division', 'are', 'signs', 'forced', 'entry', 'Carolyn', 'had', 'rep', 'pursuing', 'dangerous', 'side', 'things', 'office', '2', 'Sabich', 'given', 'case', 'Horgan', 'When', 'Carolyn', 'case-load', 'found', 'contain', 'B', 'file', 'complaint', 'official', 'misconduct', 'county', 'official', 'Sabich', 'investigation', 'office', 'Two', 'other', 'factors', 'enhance', 'intrigue', 'upcoming', 'PA', 'election', 'Horgan', 'facing', 'off', 'ambitious', 'Nico', 'Della', 'Guardia', 'former', 'PA', 'who', 'sought', 'undermine', 'Horgan', 'chance', 'working', 'biggest', 'factor', 'secret', 'Rusty', 'own', 'secret', 'affair', 'Polhemus', 'When', 'questions', 'arise', 'how', 'Sabich', 'evidence', 'ordering', 'detective', 'disregard', 'phone', 'records', 'indicating', 'numerous', 'calls', 'Carolyn', 'own', 'house', 'ordering', 'print', 'lab', 'not', 'compare', 'fingerprints', 'taken', 'glass', 'found', 'scene', 'county', 'employees', 'Sabich', 'suspicion', 'Horgan', 'loss', 'polls', 'putting', 'enemy', 'head', 'PA', 'office', 'seals', 'Sabich', 'fate', 'prosecutorial', 'muscle', 'once', 'wielded', 'now', 'directed', 'Against', 'former', 'colleague', 'Della', 'Guardia', 'called', 'Delay', 'bed', 'rep', 'missing', 'deadlines', 'Tommy', 'Molto', 'zealous', 'prosecutor', 'who', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'nothing', 'prove', 'case', 'even', 'make', 'case', 'credible', 'proves', 'critical', 'locate', 'crucial', 'bits', 'evidence', 'Two', 'critical', 'dangers', 'are', 'ironic', 'ones', 'Ray', 'Horgan', 'Lipranzer', 'detective', 'who', 'police', 'work', 'Rusty', 'case', 'suspicious', 'orders', 'ignoring', 'phone', 'Horgan', 'dangerous', 'believing', 'prosecutor', 'story', 'betrayed', 'Rusty', 'prosecution', 'claiming', 'Rusty', 'actively', 'sought', 'head', 'case', 'Lipranzer', 'dangerous', 'opposite', 'reason', 'clearly', 'Rusty', 'innocence', 'irrational', 'gut', 'reaction', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'points', 'jury', 'mindless', 'zeal', 'prosecution', 'notorious', 'incompetence', 'expert', 'witness', 'pathologist', 'who', 'entered', 'field', 'joke', 'corpse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sue', 'malpractice', 'inexplicable', 'disappearance', 'critical', 'piece', 'evidence', 'sage', 'advocacy', 'Rusty', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Alejandro', 'Sandy', 'Stern', 'judge', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'sympathize', 'Rusty', 'clearly', 'hate', 'Molto', 'Della', 'Guardia', 'Sabich', 'feels', 'condemned', 'clearly', 'guilty', 'something.Harrison', 'Ford', 'type', 'sap', 'lawyer', 'who', 'rejected', 'beautiful', 'powerful', 'woman', 'nearly', 'destroys', 'own', 'marriage', 'interesting', 'see', 'characters', 'places', 'brought', 'life', 'Turow', 'great', 'prose', 'even', 'not', 'enlivened', 'that', 'well', 'screen', 'lot', 'opportunity', 'wasted', 'here', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'Sandy', 'Stern', 'Sabich', 'accused', 'formidable', 'presence', 'book', 'prior', 'indictment', 'prosecution', 'off', 'only', 'bunch', 'hacks', 'are', 'Turow', 'dimension', 'Tommy', 'Molto', 'monkish', 'zeal', 'setting', 'up', 'potential', 'failed', 'rival', 'Carolyn', 'Nico', 'Rusty', 'complex', 'relationship', 'overlooked', 'completely', 'as', 'well', 'Rusty', 'lack', 'ambition', 'readers', 'book', 'know', 'how', 'Rusty', 'unwillingness', 'try', 'unseating', 'Horgan', 'critically', 'underlay', 'Carolyn', 'murder', 'draconian', 'corruption', 'Kindle', 'County', 'judicial', 'system', 'seemy', 'underworld', 'Night', 'Saints', 'barely', 'mention', 'Alan', 'Pakula', 'could', 'compensate', 'gaps', 'drenching', 'film', 'sort', 'dreary', 'sloth', 'everything', 'slow', 'downbeat', 'Have', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'list', 'disappointing', 'novelizations', 'great', 'books', 'ones', 'have', 'see', 'Even', 'read', 'book', 'maybe', 'especially', 'have', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'anyway', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'first']",N/A

The film gives the audience so many clues and hints that I guessed the identity of the murderer and why and how well before the movie gave us the ""big revelation""... but that was actually okay, because it does a good job of giving enough alternate suspects that I doubted my conclusion. The ending also played so well that I minded solving the mystery at the beginning of the second act even less.I'm a tremendous fan of courtroom dramas, and I enjoy watching them.

The femme fatale prosecutor, highly ambitious, also had an affair with Dennehy as well as Paul Winfield, the judge who presides over Ford's murder trial.As typical in legal circles, a cornered defendant lawyer seeking to prove his or her innocence to a jury hires a respected adversary to defend his or her cause.  After all, who has a better idea of a lawyer's worth than someone who has tangled in courtroom battle with that same individual?  In this case prosecutor Ford calls on talented defense attorney Raul Julia to represent him.  Ford is crushed to quickly learn after hiring Julia that Dennehy, the boss he refused to conspire against, after losing a bid for reelection reveals that he will testify against his former chief assistant.Also coming into the fascinating mix is the neurotic wife of Ford, played by Bonnie Bedelia, who was well aware of his tryst with his fellow prosecutor.  Bedelia plays a key role in the drama which is not resolved until after Ford's trial has played itself out.Director Alan J.

Though &#34;The Fugitive&#34; plays for more action/adventure while &#34;Presumed Innocent&#34; is much more a courtroom drama, each movie has the &#34;man accused of a crime&#34; (but the audience doesn't know if he actually did it) theme running through it.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Presumed Innocent&#34; opens with Rusty Sabich (Harrison Ford) as a high-profile deputy prosecutor working for Raymond Horgan (Brian Dennehy).  When a co-worker of Rusty's, Carolyn Polhemus (Greta Scacchi) is murdered, Rusty suddenly finds himself on the top of the suspect list.I have watched this movie twice and found that it didn't hold up as well with time as I thought it might have.  Yet, on your first, fresh viewing of this movie, you'll probably find it quite engrossing.  It has solid acting, an intriguing plot, and an ending that you won't see coming.  After that initial viewing, though, much of the suspense and surprise is lost and it doesn't hold up quite as well.I actually like this one a tad better than &#34;The Fugitive&#34;, though.  This one planted a real seed of doubt in my head regarding who was guilty/innocent, where &#34;Fugitive&#34; never went that far for me.  I also could appreciate the &#34;lawyer now being tried for a crime&#34; angle to &#34;Presumed Innocent&#34;, as it gave Ford's character some interesting angles.Overall, &#34;Presumed Innocent&#34; is a pretty solid movie.
