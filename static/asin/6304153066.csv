The story is familiar; it's been done several other times, once under the name ""Sorrowful Jones,"" with Bob Hope. This movie is a bit different from that one, so you could own both and have two different slants on the famous Damon Runyon story.This version has a lot more comedy from the supporting players, since Temple is cute but her character in this story isn't the main source of humor as Hope was in his films. In here, all the bookies and gangsters provide the humor.The leading male, played by Adolph Menjou, is a sourpuss but still likable. The leading adult female, Dorothy Dell, was a bit tough-looking, I thought, for this role.Temple doesn't play as sweet a role as she did in most of her films, but she still has her tender moments. Nobody can produce a sentimental scene as quickly as Shirley could. In all, a nice film and enjoyable from start to finish.Note: This was the best colorized version I have seen of Temple's films. Perhaps that was because MCA Universal did this VHS, not Fox, which did the others. It advertises ""stereo"" but I didn't hear any.",4,Nothing 'Sorrowful' About Shirley,1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,1143,"['only', 'two', 'songs', 'entertaining', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'film', 'story', 'familiar', 'been', 'done', 'several', 'other', 'times', 'once', 'name', 'Sorrowful', 'Jones', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'movie', 'bit', 'different', 'one', 'could', 'own', 'have', 'two', 'different', 'slants', 'famous', 'Damon', 'Runyon', 'story.This', 'version', 'lot', 'more', 'comedy', 'supporting', 'players', 'Temple', 'cute', 'character', 'story', ""n't"", 'main', 'source', 'humor', 'Hope', 'was', 'films', 'here', 'bookies', 'gangsters', 'provide', 'humor.The', 'leading', 'male', 'played', 'Adolph', 'Menjou', 'sourpuss', 'still', 'likable', 'leading', 'adult', 'female', 'Dorothy', 'Dell', 'was', 'bit', 'tough-looking', 'thought', 'role.Temple', ""n't"", 'play', 'sweet', 'role', 'did', 'most', 'films', 'still', 'tender', 'moments', 'Nobody', 'can', 'produce', 'sentimental', 'scene', 'as', 'quickly', 'Shirley', 'could', 'nice', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'start', 'finish.Note', 'was', 'best', 'colorized', 'version', 'have', 'seen', 'Temple', 'films', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'MCA', 'Universal', 'did', 'VHS', 'not', 'Fox', 'did', 'others', 'stereo', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear']",Little Miss Marker VHS
404467,A1LNKP2IBYVH90,6304153066,"""denise_imaan""","[22, 22]","One of the best films based on Damon Runyon's stories, 'Little Miss Marker' is a well-cast, smartly directed movie.Yes, Shirley Temple plays the title character. Five years old and on loan from her home studio, Fox,  she gave a fresh and interesting performance.  Those who loathe the treacle  and unrealistic characters in Temple's later work will find this film a  pleasant surprise. Shirley doesn't sing (she has one short song), she  doesn't dance, and she doesn't play an angel. She does, however, show off  her incredible acting talent as an orphaned child thrown among gangsters.  As she spends more time with them, she falls more and more under their  influence, until she turns into a baby moll who tells people to  &quot;scram&quot; and &quot;lay off&quot;. It's an interesting commentary  on the influence parents and adults have on the children who observe  them.The film captures the atmosphere of the early thirties very well.  Dorothy Dell, playing lounge singer/gun moll Bangles,is fantastic, and does  a wonderful number at the Diamond Horseshoe cabaret.Even if you aren't a  Temple fan, you'll probably love this film!",5,A Runyon Classic with a great cast!,958867200,"05 21, 2000",2000,1136,"['One', 'best', 'films', 'based', 'Damon', 'Runyon', 'stories', 'Miss', 'Marker', 'well-cast', 'smartly', 'directed', 'movie.Yes', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'title', 'character', 'Five', 'years', 'old', 'loan', 'home', 'studio', 'Fox', 'gave', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'performance', 'who', 'loathe', 'treacle', 'unrealistic', 'characters', 'Temple', 'later', 'work', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Shirley', ""n't"", 'sing', 'one', 'short', 'song', ""n't"", 'dance', ""n't"", 'play', 'angel', 'however', 'show', 'off', 'incredible', 'acting', 'talent', 'orphaned', 'child', 'thrown', 'gangsters', 'more', 'time', 'more', 'more', 'influence', 'baby', 'moll', 'who', 'people', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'influence', 'parents', 'adults', 'have', 'children', 'who', 'observe', 'them.The', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'early', 'thirties', 'very', 'well', 'Dorothy', 'Dell', 'playing', 'lounge', 'singer/gun', 'moll', 'Bangles', 'fantastic', 'wonderful', 'number', 'Diamond', 'Horseshoe', 'cabaret.Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'Temple', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'film']",Little Miss Marker VHS
404468,AKKSHEGRQVQRK,6304153066,Great Movie Addict,"[18, 19]","Most of Shirley Temple's films are so corny, you wonder how one release kept leading to yet another.  &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot;, which was remade many times over the years, is the easy answer.  It was Shirley's  first movie and, yes, she's an orphan from the very start.  But thanks to  Damon Runyan, a wonderful cast led by Adolph Menjou, and a very original  story line (again, thank you Mr. Runyan), the start of the Shirley Temple  series is a comical, off-beat delight that surpasses the distilled maple  syrup of her later efforts, enjoyable though they may be.  Only in the  early thirties would you find such a movie as this, and in no other film  does the neat and dapper Adolph Menjou play such an unrepentant, but  soft-hearted, slob (seeing this alone is worth the price of the movie).  It  would be great if Hollywood had not lost the knack for making films like  this.  If you don't like Shirley Temple that much, but you'd like to know  what all the noise was about, you'll like this one.",5,"Shirley Temple's First, and Best",942624000,"11 15, 1999",1999,1008,"['Most', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'corny', 'wonder', 'how', 'one', 'release', 'kept', 'leading', 'yet', 'quot', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Marker', 'quot', 'was', 'remade', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'easy', 'answer', 'was', 'Shirley', 'first', 'movie', 'yes', 'orphan', 'very', 'start', 'thanks', 'Damon', 'Runyan', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'led', 'Adolph', 'Menjou', 'very', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'again', 'thank', 'Mr.', 'Runyan', 'start', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'series', 'comical', 'off-beat', 'delight', 'distilled', 'maple', 'syrup', 'later', 'efforts', 'enjoyable', 'may', 'be', 'Only', 'early', 'thirties', 'would', 'find', 'such', 'movie', 'other', 'film', 'neat', 'dapper', 'Adolph', 'Menjou', 'play', 'unrepentant', 'soft-hearted', 'slob', 'seeing', 'alone', 'price', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'not', 'lost', 'knack', 'making', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'much', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'what', 'noise', 'was', 'about', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one']",Little Miss Marker VHS

It is hard to believe that Dell was only nineteen years old when she made this film; she died two weeks after the film's release in a horrific nighttime car accident. But she looks and acts much, much older...she was beautiful, talented, and had an extremely promising future.Oh, yes...and Shirley Temple? Well, I think this was the best role she ever did. She was so little (five years old) and so gifted and natural in this role...her later movies were too sugary for my taste! She and Dell and Adoph Menjou had marvelous chemistry together in this film, although Menjou was terrified of Temple's screen presence and knew she was stealing the film.Well worth seeing!",4,Best Shirley Temple movie of all,1095552000,"09 19, 2004",2004,828,"['Actually', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'fascinated', 'Dorothy', 'Dell', 'who', 'starred', 'Bangles', 'Carson', 'tough', 'gambler', 'girlfriend', 'nightclub', 'singer', 'hard', 'believe', 'Dell', 'was', 'only', 'nineteen', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'died', 'two', 'weeks', 'film', 'release', 'horrific', 'nighttime', 'car', 'accident', 'much', 'much', 'older', 'was', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'had', 'extremely', 'promising', 'future.Oh', 'yes', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Well', 'think', 'was', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'did', 'was', 'so', 'little', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'so', 'gifted', 'natural', 'role', 'later', 'movies', 'were', 'too', 'sugary', 'taste', 'Dell', 'Adoph', 'Menjou', 'had', 'marvelous', 'chemistry', 'together', 'film', 'Menjou', 'was', 'terrified', 'Temple', 'screen', 'presence', 'knew', 'was', 'stealing', 'film.Well', 'seeing']",Little Miss Marker VHS

When her father doesn't return, it's up to Jones and his racetrack cronies to make a home for the wee tyke.
