Not the case, he uses a gun or fights with a fist....it is just a decent show very much like a 1950 American Western.  No real supporting cast, just Peter Graves running a stagecoach company.  Not a bad show for a rainy day...glad I ordered it.  The set is four DVDS with about ten shows on each.Quick update the more you watch the show the more you will like it.
