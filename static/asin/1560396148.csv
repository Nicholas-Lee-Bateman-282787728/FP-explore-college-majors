It doesn't have the whole cast-just Shaggy and Scooby but hey they're the funny ones. With the help of Scooby's nephew (Scrappy) this was one of the most interesting mysteries Scooby has ever had to solve.Shaggy and Scooby make this really funny with their usual jokes and the Boo brothers add great excitement to the plot of the story. This video is really worth it and has even better pranks mainly due to the way Shaggy reacts when the boy-chasing girl comes to sight. It's one of the best Scooby Doo movies ever! All the unusual incidents are linked to the plot and if you're a Scooby fan-you'll love this I mean it even has a party for ghouls and ghosts (think of how Scooby &Shaggy; would react). If you like this, make sure you don't but ""Ghoul school"". It's yet another edition with only Scooby and Shaggy in it but it's not as funny.

182774,A3FVIFL4HGI5CL,1560396148,Alexiel,"[8, 10]","The premise is that Shaggy inherents a spooky, decaying mansion from his Uncle Beaureguard, and the movie begins as he, Scrappy-Doo, and Scooby-Doo are en route to the mansion. The whole estate is pretty spooky and decayed looking, replete with swamps and forests surrounding the house, a perfect setting for mystery and mayhem. At the mansion they are greeted by a sinister butler with a humorously overdone but still jarring laugh in Farquard.This does nothing to alleviate the nervousness Shaggy and Scooby are feeling, and with the introduction of the ghost of Uncle Beaureguard, an escaped ape (pursued by Sheriff Buzby, your typical thick-drawled, incompetent, and overweight Southern sheriff stereotype) they're ready to leave, when they find a message from Uncle Beaureguard that says Shaggy must solve a series of riddles to locate his treasure. To deal with the ghosts, they call in ""ghost exterminators"" - the Boo Brothers, who indeed are a knock-off of the Three Stooges in every way.With the treasure beckoning, and the fact that their truck is incapacitated, they stick around, despite Uncle Beaureguard's ghost, a skeleton ghost, a headless horseman, the ape, the bumbling sheriff, the Boo Brothers doing more interfering than helping, a hillbilly girl who has fallen in love with Shaggy and takes every opportunity to press her unwanted affections, and her hillbilly brother who ""protects"" his sister by hunting Shagggy and the gang and shooting at them. Well, treasure usually isn't easy to come by.The riddles lead the gang around various areas of the esate - to the attic, basement, graveyard, caves, etc. One of the things that appealed to me as a kid (and still does) was the neat idea of this vast, spooky estate you could explore, with the fearful crumbling mansion at the forefront. There's secret passages to be found, and the skeleton and Confederate ghost (Uncle Beaureguard) to be found at every turn, or more mundane foes to be avoided. The idea of the riddles, that solving the first riddle leads you to the location of the second one, and so on, was something I thought was very cool as a kid, though it's an old idea.I think the animation and look of the show is pretty well done, considering the time, budget, and technology. The mansion and its grounds do give off a spooky air of decay and mystery; the setting is excellently accomplished. The supporting characters are mostly old stereotypes played out for humor but that works well for what it is. The ghosts are suitably menacing for this sort of thing, and Scrappy-Doo isn't as obnoxious as he's been on other occasions (though I'd like to have seen what this movie would've been like with the original Mystery, Inc. gang). The suspense of getting to the treasure is nicely built up, and there are some fine revelations along the way to keep viewers interested.In conclusion, this movie isn't rocket science or anything complicated. In fact, to your average modern audience there probably isn't a whole lot ot recommend this film. But, for whatever reason, it clicked with me growing up and even now. It's got a classic gothic ghost story set-up, which usually appeals to me, along with some slapstick and typical Scooby-Doo humor. It's fun, moves quickly, and shows more than just perfunctory thought and effort put into it (as opposed to later Scooby-Doo movies). I give it five stars because it succeeds for what it is.",5,"A childhood favorite of mine, still plenty of typical Scooby Doo fun.",1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,3411,"['premise', 'Shaggy', 'spooky', 'decaying', 'mansion', 'Uncle', 'Beaureguard', 'movie', 'Scrappy-Doo', 'Scooby-Doo', 'are', 'en', 'route', 'mansion', 'whole', 'estate', 'pretty', 'spooky', 'decayed', 'looking', 'replete', 'swamps', 'forests', 'surrounding', 'house', 'perfect', 'setting', 'mystery', 'mayhem', 'mansion', 'are', 'greeted', 'sinister', 'butler', 'humorously', 'overdone', 'still', 'jarring', 'laugh', 'Farquard.This', 'nothing', 'alleviate', 'nervousness', 'Shaggy', 'Scooby', 'are', 'feeling', 'introduction', 'ghost', 'Uncle', 'Beaureguard', 'escaped', 'ape', 'pursued', 'Sheriff', 'Buzby', 'typical', 'thick-drawled', 'incompetent', 'overweight', 'Southern', 'sheriff', 'stereotype', ""'re"", 'ready', 'leave', 'when', 'find', 'message', 'Uncle', 'Beaureguard', 'Shaggy', 'must', 'solve', 'series', 'riddles', 'locate', 'treasure', 'deal', 'ghosts', 'call', 'ghost', 'exterminators', 'Boo', 'Brothers', 'who', 'indeed', 'are', 'knock-off', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'way.With', 'treasure', 'beckoning', 'fact', 'truck', 'incapacitated', 'stick', 'around', 'Uncle', 'Beaureguard', 'ghost', 'skeleton', 'ghost', 'headless', 'horseman', 'ape', 'bumbling', 'sheriff', 'Boo', 'Brothers', 'doing', 'more', 'interfering', 'helping', 'hillbilly', 'girl', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'Shaggy', 'opportunity', 'press', 'unwanted', 'affections', 'hillbilly', 'brother', 'who', 'protects', 'sister', 'hunting', 'Shagggy', 'gang', 'shooting', 'Well', 'treasure', 'usually', ""n't"", 'easy', 'come', 'by.The', 'riddles', 'lead', 'gang', 'various', 'areas', 'esate', 'attic', 'basement', 'graveyard', 'caves', 'etc', 'One', 'things', 'appealed', 'kid', 'still', 'was', 'neat', 'idea', 'vast', 'spooky', 'estate', 'could', 'explore', 'fearful', 'crumbling', 'mansion', 'forefront', 'secret', 'passages', 'be', 'found', 'skeleton', 'Confederate', 'ghost', 'Uncle', 'Beaureguard', 'be', 'found', 'turn', 'more', 'mundane', 'foes', 'be', 'avoided', 'idea', 'riddles', 'solving', 'first', 'riddle', 'location', 'second', 'one', 'so', 'was', 'something', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'kid', 'old', 'idea.I', 'think', 'animation', 'look', 'show', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'considering', 'time', 'budget', 'technology', 'mansion', 'grounds', 'do', 'give', 'off', 'spooky', 'air', 'decay', 'mystery', 'setting', 'excellently', 'accomplished', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'old', 'stereotypes', 'played', 'out', 'humor', 'well', 'what', 'ghosts', 'are', 'suitably', 'menacing', 'sort', 'thing', 'Scrappy-Doo', ""n't"", 'as', 'obnoxious', 'been', 'other', 'occasions', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'original', 'Mystery', 'Inc.', 'gang', 'suspense', 'getting', 'treasure', 'nicely', 'built', 'up', 'are', 'fine', 'revelations', 'way', 'keep', 'viewers', 'interested.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rocket', 'science', 'anything', 'complicated', 'fact', 'average', 'modern', 'audience', 'probably', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'ot', 'recommend', 'film', 'reason', 'clicked', 'growing', 'up', 'even', 'now', 'got', 'classic', 'gothic', 'ghost', 'story', 'set-up', 'usually', 'appeals', 'slapstick', 'typical', 'Scooby-Doo', 'humor', 'fun', 'moves', 'quickly', 'more', 'just', 'perfunctory', 'thought', 'effort', 'put', 'opposed', 'later', 'Scooby-Doo', 'movies', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'what']",N/A

182776,A1YB29BIDULEYE,1560396148,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","While this is a departure from the standard Scooby Doo formula, it is a rather good movie. Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy travel down South where Shaggy has inherited a mansion. They arrive to find out that it may be infested with ghosts. (Big surprise) To make matters worse, there is a butler who wants the inheritance for himself, a crazy man with a loaded gun taking shots at Shaggy, and to top it off, a woman obsessed with Shaggy who is cute and sweet, but not terribly attractive. Shaggy and Scooby want to leave, but they run into car trouble and can't leave until morning.Since they are stuck there, they decide they may as well look for the secret treasure of the house. It is interesting that each clue they find offers a clue to find the next clue. (If we wanted to be 'smart' we could say it does seem strange that none of the clues disappeared, seeing that they were diamonds.)Moving on though, certain fears get the better of our favorite trio,and they decide to call some ghost catchers who turn out to be ghosts themselves. (But the author may have known what he was doing. He may have been trying to underline that greed and NOT ghosts are the true horror.) These ghosts bumble like the 3 stooges, but they are hilarious and lovable. And the really interesting thing is that after a 'very long eventually,' they do prove themselves heroic.I don't want to say too much and ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But we have suspense, some horror, and a lot of laughs. Granted, it's probably not Scooby's best movie, but it is certainly worthy of a chance.

182782,A319SKSB556033,1560396148,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[19, 22]","This entry suffers from the presence of Scrappy. It was made in the mid-eighties when Scrappy was at the height (!) of his fame (?). He doesn't do much in this so it's not that bad.The story is about Shaggy (minus the rest of Mystery Inc.) being left a spooky mansion house in his uncles will. Conveniently said mansion is in the middle of a creepy swampland in the Deep South. The kind of place where there are always eyes watching from the trees.As soon as he arrives, Shaggy has to deal with an annoying southern stereotype sheriff, a weirdo butler who wants to get his hands on the old uncle's hidden treasure, hickabilly neighbors and the ghost of his uncle telling to leave (then why did he give him the house?). There is also an escaped ape on the loose but even though only Scooby sees him (Shaggy doesn't believe it) he's just a big, cuddly monkey who wants to play.The Boo Brothers are basically ghost versions of the Three Stooges. They're listed in the phone book as being experts in the busting of ghosts. This isn't a job they do well though, so Shaggy's payment at the end is a bit too generous.There are some laughs to be had and the plot is mildly interesting but too many running jokes are just plain bad. The hillbilly neighbor joke becomes very boring and could have been done without. The animation is a bit dated, though it has enough modern touches (lens flares in car lights) to distract you from it. And I like the dark, decaying atmosphere of the swampland. The color pallet is mostly made up of dark blues and purples (the story takes place all in one night) and the backgrounds are not as generic as the earlier, cheaper TV shows.For the average fan this is a worthy effort though I would just catch it on the Cartoon Network instead of forking over the cash, unless you're a Scooby completist.The DVD is in 1.33:1 full frame, as drawn, with a Dolby Mono soundtrack that is unsophisticated but workable.
