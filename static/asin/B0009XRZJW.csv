It is well conceived, edited, and extremely well recorded. Bruce Hornsby is playful, very loose on stage, a DVD which showcases many on his fans favorite tunes, in a very jazzy, improvisational, and very very tight performances with his band members, all of which really outshine following Hornsby superb piano playing and singing. This is truly talent at its best. I have all of Bruce Hornby's DVD and CD's, but this one is the best of them all. It is highly recommended.

916268,A202FL2VAJS6AM,B0009XRZJW,"Nadia ""Nadia""","[0, 0]","Fall of 2004--this is a WOW! video!--for both the quality of jaw dropping great performances of Bruce & band as well as a very rewarding view behind the scenes.Three Nights on the Town starts off with Bruce's arrival in New York City on his way to the legendary jazz mecca, the Blue Note. Good quality video. You will enjoy and experience 160 minutes of fabulous music, Bruce and band behind the scenes at play, at work, and informal interviews. Bruce does three concerts at three historic New York City venues: the Blue Note, the ""venerated"" Town Hall in a sold-out concert, (where in the early 60's Bob Dylan performed a truly superlative rendition of ""Masters of War"" which ended with a ROARING ovation), and a solo piano concert at Carnegie Hall's prestigious Zankel Hall, (which unfortunately is not included in this CD).At the Blue Note he performs his best & live performance of his masterpiece, ""Resting Place,"" which was put in Intersections. I HAD to combine the video with the CD in my stereo to try to get the full impact of the music and see Bruce singing and playing this, since this is one of my top favorites. I was able to get the sound and voice to match EXACTLY after a few frustrating tries. I found they EDITED the one in Intersections taking out some intitial piano playing. I am SURE the live supermasterpiece renditions of Candy Mountain Run and White Wheeled Limousine/Long Black Veil that are in Intersections are also performed in this DVD. Don't shoot me if I'm wrong, but I am 100% sure these renditions are included in Intersections--my judgment call. They edited all of them just a little, to my chagrin. However, in this CD you see and hear Bruce & band play ""Resting Place"" and the other songs from beginning to end. I really want to see Bruce play the piano from a good angle. I would have preferred to see more of Bruce at the piano at good angles--not too close and parallel as in this DVD. Bruce and his very talented musicians effortlessly turn (it seems effortless) many favorites into improvisional and compositional ""music magic"" masterpieces. Bruce and his band really let loose, and some real supermasterpieces are created right before your eyes.Bruce tells how he was influenced by Bob Dylan. When I first heard ""Resting Place"" in Intersections, (which was my second CD--or CDs I got from him), I immediately thought of Bob Dylan's ""Shelter From the Storm.""Bruce explains how difficult it is to play two-handed independence and gives the DVD audience some explanations and demonstrations. He might have been referring to the request from one of his fans from an earlier concert, and you can hear Bruce in a spectacular demonstration of two-handed independence on the two-CD set, Here Come the Noisemakers. I believe I hear two-handed independence when I listen to an equally spectacular rendition of King of the Hill in Intersections, even though it is not officially announced as in Here Come the Noisemakers. He explained that it's like splitting your brain in half, and it takes three months, more or less, to practice into the mastery he possesses--not his words--just my paraphrasing of what he said. I was relieved to hear that he, too, has to practice! After I heard he started taking piano lessons at age 8 for just one year and then resumed his lessons at age 17, I felt like I had been kicked in the stomach. I think I'm jealous for the first time in my life! It took him only about 2-3 years to be ready for university-level music?--he is indeed a musical genius to say the least. Oh my God!Jazz is a highly intellectual type of music, they said, and that adds another point to his genius. Don't mess with Brucey baby! He can split his brain in half--each side working independently of the other, he is an intellectual, music is math--he's super intelligent; Oh my God! If you are his accountant, get those figures right the first time, and if you are his lawyer, ask him for advise first! Don't make ANY mistakes. Get all those notes correct! Ha ha.Very rarely do I get impressed by anyone, but when I saw Bruce for the very first time on video in Intersections after lavishing him with praise on my first review for his music alone, I fell over backwards and became one with the floor, seared flat into the carpet! The rescue squad from the Fire Dept. had to come & peel me off the floor! Ha ha.Bruce is terrific, the band is terrific. Get his DVD.Next time I want to see Bruce's fingers on that keyboard at the right angle for longer periods of time--too close and parallel some of the time. Get those right angles where I can really watch him go at that keyboard for a while!",5,DON'T MESS WITH BRUCE!,1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,4634,"['Fall', '2004', 'WOW', 'video', 'quality', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'great', 'performances', 'Bruce', 'band', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'rewarding', 'view', 'scenes.Three', 'Nights', 'Town', 'Bruce', 'arrival', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'way', 'legendary', 'jazz', 'mecca', 'Blue', 'Note', 'Good', 'quality', 'video', 'will', 'enjoy', 'experience', '160', 'minutes', 'fabulous', 'music', 'Bruce', 'band', 'scenes', 'play', 'work', 'informal', 'interviews', 'Bruce', 'three', 'concerts', 'three', 'historic', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'venues', 'Blue', 'Note', 'venerated', 'Town', 'Hall', 'sold-out', 'concert', 'where', 'early', '60', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'performed', 'truly', 'superlative', 'rendition', 'Masters', 'War', 'ended', 'ROARING', 'ovation', 'solo', 'piano', 'concert', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'prestigious', 'Zankel', 'Hall', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'included', 'CD', 'Blue', 'Note', 'best', 'live', 'performance', 'masterpiece', 'Resting', 'Place', 'was', 'put', 'Intersections', 'HAD', 'combine', 'video', 'CD', 'stereo', 'try', 'get', 'full', 'impact', 'music', 'see', 'Bruce', 'singing', 'playing', 'one', 'top', 'favorites', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'sound', 'voice', 'match', 'EXACTLY', 'few', 'frustrating', 'tries', 'found', 'EDITED', 'one', 'Intersections', 'taking', 'out', 'intitial', 'piano', 'playing', 'am', 'SURE', 'live', 'supermasterpiece', 'renditions', 'Candy', 'Mountain', 'Run', 'White', 'Wheeled', 'Limousine/Long', 'Black', 'Veil', 'are', 'Intersections', 'are', 'also', 'performed', 'DVD', 'Do', ""n't"", 'shoot', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'am', '100', '%', 'sure', 'renditions', 'are', 'included', 'Intersections', 'judgment', 'call', 'edited', 'just', 'little', 'chagrin', 'However', 'CD', 'see', 'hear', 'Bruce', 'band', 'play', 'Resting', 'Place', 'other', 'songs', 'beginning', 'end', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Bruce', 'play', 'piano', 'good', 'angle', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'more', 'Bruce', 'piano', 'good', 'angles', 'not', 'too', 'close', 'parallel', 'DVD', 'Bruce', 'very', 'talented', 'musicians', 'effortlessly', 'turn', 'many', 'favorites', 'improvisional', 'compositional', 'music', 'magic', 'masterpieces', 'Bruce', 'band', 'really', 'let', 'loose', 'real', 'supermasterpieces', 'are', 'created', 'right', 'eyes.Bruce', 'how', 'was', 'influenced', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Resting', 'Place', 'Intersections', 'was', 'second', 'CD', 'CDs', 'got', 'immediately', 'thought', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Shelter', 'Storm', 'Bruce', 'how', 'difficult', 'play', 'two-handed', 'independence', 'DVD', 'audience', 'explanations', 'demonstrations', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'referring', 'request', 'one', 'fans', 'earlier', 'concert', 'can', 'hear', 'Bruce', 'spectacular', 'demonstration', 'two-handed', 'independence', 'two-CD', 'set', 'Here', 'Come', 'Noisemakers', 'believe', 'hear', 'two-handed', 'independence', 'when', 'listen', 'equally', 'spectacular', 'rendition', 'King', 'Hill', 'Intersections', 'even', 'not', 'officially', 'announced', 'Here', 'Come', 'Noisemakers', 'explained', 'splitting', 'brain', 'half', 'three', 'months', 'more', 'less', 'practice', 'mastery', 'not', 'words', 'just', 'paraphrasing', 'what', 'said', 'was', 'relieved', 'hear', 'too', 'practice', 'heard', 'started', 'taking', 'piano', 'lessons', 'age', '8', 'just', 'one', 'year', 'then', 'resumed', 'lessons', 'age', '17', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'kicked', 'stomach', 'think', ""'m"", 'jealous', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'took', 'only', '2-3', 'years', 'be', 'ready', 'university-level', 'music', 'indeed', 'musical', 'genius', 'say', 'least', 'Oh', 'God', 'Jazz', 'highly', 'intellectual', 'type', 'music', 'said', 'point', 'genius', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'Brucey', 'baby', 'can', 'split', 'brain', 'side', 'working', 'independently', 'other', 'intellectual', 'music', 'math', 'super', 'intelligent', 'Oh', 'God', 'are', 'accountant', 'get', 'figures', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'lawyer', 'advise', 'first', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'ANY', 'mistakes', 'Get', 'notes', 'correct', 'Ha', 'ha.Very', 'rarely', 'do', 'get', 'impressed', 'anyone', 'when', 'saw', 'Bruce', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'video', 'Intersections', 'lavishing', 'praise', 'first', 'review', 'music', 'alone', 'fell', 'backwards', 'became', 'one', 'floor', 'seared', 'flat', 'carpet', 'rescue', 'squad', 'Fire', 'Dept', 'had', 'come', 'peel', 'off', 'floor', 'Ha', 'ha.Bruce', 'terrific', 'band', 'terrific', 'Get', 'DVD.Next', 'time', 'want', 'see', 'Bruce', 'fingers', 'keyboard', 'right', 'angle', 'longer', 'periods', 'time', 'too', 'close', 'parallel', 'time', 'Get', 'right', 'angles', 'where', 'can', 'really', 'watch', 'go', 'keyboard', 'while']",N/A
916269,A1S4E1QSHSAD8O,B0009XRZJW,R. D. Clark,"[38, 39]","Finally, a concert video that actually comes close to capturing the experience of a Bruce Hornsby concert!Previous Hornsby videos have been OK for what they were - TV specials, staged concerts, stunt events full of ""special guests."" Hornsby's music and talent are too good to produce a bad show.But this one, recorded at NYC's Town Hall during last year's Halcyon Days tour, is the real deal: Bruce and his band, the Noisemakers, in what feels like a complete show (it probably isn't, since they usually play longer than this, but since every Bruce show is different it doesn't matter that much; the editing is true-to-life, so it looks and feels like a real, complete show).When you watch this band play you can see how closely attuned they are to each other, and how well they know Bruce's moves, and how well Bruce understands their capabilities. He can take off on an improvisation in the middle of a song and they know how and when to follow him (and when not to), and they can bring each other back to the song as if they're all mind readers. While there's a bit less adventuring in this show than usual, you can still feel that tightness, and the video captures it very well.The video puts you right on stage, up close and personal, with cameras everywhere and plenty of face time for everyone. The editing is excellent, very sane, very attuned to the music, almost never getting in the way. The sound is equally good, a clean, clear concert mix that puts you in the front row without overwhelming you with audience ambience. DTS would have been nice, but the DD 5.1 is fine.If you attended any of the band's concerts in the last year, this video will become a treasured souvinir. If you are a fan or Hornsby but haven't seen him live in a while, you will be amazed at how versatile and spontaneous, effortless and masterful his live performances have become. And if you're only casually familiar with Hornsby from his hits, you will be simply astonished by one of America's most talented musicians, performing here at the height of his powers, supported by a band that complements him in every respect.I had high hopes for this disc since I first heard about its planned release, and for once my expectations have been exceeded.Very highly recommended.RichC",5,The One We've Been Waiting For,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,2265,"['Finally', 'concert', 'video', 'actually', 'close', 'capturing', 'experience', 'Bruce', 'Hornsby', 'concert', 'Previous', 'Hornsby', 'videos', 'have', 'been', 'OK', 'what', 'were', 'TV', 'specials', 'staged', 'concerts', 'stunt', 'events', 'full', 'special', 'guests', 'Hornsby', 'music', 'talent', 'are', 'too', 'good', 'produce', 'bad', 'show.But', 'one', 'recorded', 'NYC', 'Town', 'Hall', 'last', 'year', 'Halcyon', 'Days', 'tour', 'real', 'deal', 'Bruce', 'band', 'Noisemakers', 'what', 'feels', 'complete', 'show', 'probably', ""n't"", 'usually', 'play', 'longer', 'Bruce', 'show', 'different', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'editing', 'true-to-life', 'feels', 'real', 'complete', 'show', '.When', 'watch', 'band', 'play', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'closely', 'attuned', 'are', 'other', 'how', 'well', 'know', 'Bruce', 'moves', 'how', 'well', 'Bruce', 'capabilities', 'can', 'take', 'off', 'improvisation', 'middle', 'song', 'know', 'how', 'when', 'follow', 'when', 'not', 'can', 'bring', 'other', 'back', 'song', ""'re"", 'mind', 'readers', 'bit', 'less', 'adventuring', 'show', 'usual', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'tightness', 'video', 'very', 'well.The', 'video', 'right', 'stage', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'cameras', 'everywhere', 'plenty', 'face', 'time', 'everyone', 'editing', 'excellent', 'very', 'sane', 'very', 'attuned', 'music', 'almost', 'never', 'getting', 'way', 'sound', 'equally', 'good', 'clean', 'clear', 'concert', 'mix', 'front', 'row', 'overwhelming', 'audience', 'ambience', 'DTS', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'DD', '5.1', 'fine.If', 'attended', 'band', 'concerts', 'last', 'year', 'video', 'will', 'become', 'treasured', 'souvinir', 'are', 'fan', 'Hornsby', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'live', 'while', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'versatile', 'spontaneous', 'effortless', 'masterful', 'live', 'performances', 'have', 'become', ""'re"", 'only', 'casually', 'familiar', 'Hornsby', 'hits', 'will', 'be', 'simply', 'astonished', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'talented', 'musicians', 'performing', 'here', 'height', 'powers', 'supported', 'band', 'respect.I', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'disc', 'first', 'heard', 'planned', 'release', 'once', 'expectations', 'have', 'been', 'exceeded.Very', 'highly', 'recommended.RichC']",N/A
