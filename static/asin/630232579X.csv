308036,A2RBXYJCIM8OEI,630232579X,Brandon Sites,"[0, 3]","If you enjoyed this review, check out my film review blog at: criticbrandoncsites.blogspot.comOnly When I Laugh (1981) ** / 4D: Glenn JordanC: Marsha Mason, Kristy McNichol, James Coco, Joan Hackett, David Dukes, Kevin BaconP: Adaptation of Neil Simon's play, The Gingerbread Lady, (written by Simon) about a Broadway actress as she struggles to stay sober after a stint in rehab and to repair her fractured relationship with her daughter.There's no denying that Neil Simon is a gifted writer. This is the man that brought us The Odd Couple & Barefoot in the Park. With Only When I Laugh, Simon seems handicapped by his own success. Instead of giving us a meaningful glimpse into a woman who has to come to terms with her alcoholism and to make amends with her daughter, Simon gives one emotionally implausible scene after another in which the characters sometimes talk about their struggles, they laugh, they cry and then everything is all right again as though nothing happened. Simon dodges the big questions and goes for the easy answers all in an effort to create a feel good dramedy.Only When I Laugh is partially redeemed by the performances of its lead actors. Mason provides a solid foundation for the film. Hackett takes a character who could have came across as very one dimensional and manages to turn her into a flawed human being who has to reexamine her life. Coco is earnest and appealing, but isn't given much to work with.However, it's McNichol who really shines. She manages to capture all the angst, all the torment that her character has faced at witnessing her mom become an alcoholic over the years. In one particularly hard hitting scene, McNichol finally confronts her mom. McNichol, who was either 18 or 19 when this was filmed, proves that she is an emotionally rich actress whose range was far beyond her years. A better movie would have been told from McNichol's point of view.Watching Only When I Laugh, all I could think about was how this could have been a timeless story, an important story, something that could resonate with several different generations, the type of story that needs to be told. All I could think was What If? There's a good film in there somewhere. Too bad the film shoots itself in the foot, because Simon lacked the conviction to follow through with the subject matter at hand.

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[18, 19]","Another classic Neil Simon-Marsha Mason collaboration (when they were married), &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot; is aptly-titled: as Mason's character explains, she laughs only when her heart is pierced. In her case here, that happens a lot and is masterfully crafted by Simon's bittersweet perspective of his lead character's life, and Mason's flawless delivery. Her character is a recovering alcoholic, and it is her rocky road to recovery that is the benchmark of this film. On the surface, it's much too easy to assess the film as a story about alcoholism. Actually, it's about recovery. And, as most recovering addicts do (God bless 'em), Mason's character finds that life even without chemicals isn't always a bed of roses. As Mason's daughter, Kristy McNichol is the poster child for Al-Anon, and she is awesome as the child of a recovering addict. Sadly, the two strongest supporting performers aren't with us anymore, but Joan Hackett and James Coca are truly magnificent as the friends who carry Mason through the harshness of recovery and, all too commonly, her &quot;slip.&quot; It's a timeless message about recovery, and it's a jewel made all the more remarkable by Simon's obvious knowledge about his subject.",4,The Reality of Recovery,1037145600,"11 13, 2002",2002,1221,"['classic', 'Neil', 'Simon-Marsha', 'Mason', 'collaboration', 'when', 'were', 'married', 'quot', 'Only', 'When', 'Laugh', 'quot', 'aptly-titled', 'Mason', 'character', 'only', 'when', 'heart', 'pierced', 'case', 'here', 'lot', 'masterfully', 'crafted', 'Simon', 'bittersweet', 'perspective', 'lead', 'character', 'life', 'Mason', 'flawless', 'delivery', 'character', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'rocky', 'road', 'recovery', 'benchmark', 'film', 'surface', 'much', 'too', 'easy', 'assess', 'film', 'story', 'alcoholism', 'Actually', 'recovery', 'most', 'recovering', 'addicts', 'do', 'God', 'bless', 'Mason', 'character', 'life', 'even', 'chemicals', ""n't"", 'always', 'bed', 'roses', 'Mason', 'daughter', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'poster', 'child', 'Al-Anon', 'awesome', 'child', 'recovering', 'addict', 'Sadly', 'two', 'strongest', 'supporting', 'performers', 'are', ""n't"", 'anymore', 'Joan', 'Hackett', 'James', 'Coca', 'are', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'friends', 'who', 'carry', 'Mason', 'harshness', 'recovery', 'too', 'commonly', 'quot', 'quot', 'timeless', 'message', 'recovery', 'jewel', 'made', 'more', 'remarkable', 'Simon', 'obvious', 'knowledge', 'subject']",Only When I Laugh VHS
308039,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,630232579X,Classic film buff,"[2, 2]","""Only When I Laugh"" which opened in September 1981 was actually a cinematic revision by Neil Simon of his dark tragicomedy ""The Gingerbread Lady"".  Originally it opened on Broadway in December 1970 with a Tony winning performance by Maureen Stapleton, and several years later Elaine Stritch played it to similar acclaim in London.  Simon in reworking his play made the screenplay more upbeat and optimistically hopeful, and tailored the leading role to the talents of his then wife Marsha Mason.As the film begins Georgia Hines (Marsha Mason) an actress who also happens to be a recovering alcoholic, has just been released from a rehabilitation center in Long Island.  One of her best friends the wealthy, narcissistic beauty Toby Landau (Joan Hackett) drives Georgia back to her Manhattan apartment.  Georgia's other best friend Jimmy Perrino (James Coco) an aging, struggling actor waits there to welcome her back into the world with a feast of bagels, smoked salmon and diet soda.  Although Georgia is delighted with her reunion with both, and that she is officially ""rehabilitated"", she is shaky and uncertain as she tries to reestablish her life. Her bright teenage daughter Polly (Kristy McNichol) who has been living with her father, Georgia's ex-husband, wants to move in with her.  Georgia although she loves Polly, isn't sure she's up to the responsibility.  To further complicate matters, Georgia's ex-lover writer David Lowe (David Dukes) has written a play about their stormy relationship and asks Georgia to portray herself in a Broadway bound production.  Georgia accepts, but finds juggling motherhood, play rehearsals, and the demands of her friendship with Toby and Jimmy are overwhelming at times, particularly since old romantic feelings are reemerging for David.In reshaping and adapting his play ""The Gingerbread Lady"" into a screenplay Neil Simon transformed its heroine a small time nightclub singer Evy Meara into the younger stage actress Georgia Hines.  The changes in the character and the play were only for the better, I think having read the play and seen the film.  Georgia is not as world weary and self-destructive as Evy who also could be classified as a potential nymphomaniac, her wit and humor while sharp and self-deprecating is not as bitterly lacerating as Evy's.  Overall, most of the changes are improvements, although there is one archly cute sequence that could make you squirm when two college boys (one is Kevin Bacon in an early role) try to pick up Polly and Georgia and believe that Georgia is a college student.Marsha Mason had played several roles written for her by husband Neil Simon, ""Chapter Two"", ""The Goodbye Girl"", ""Max Dugan Returns"", but this was her richest, most heartfelt performance.  She doesn't shrink from Georgia's less attractive qualities, warts and all are revealed, at times her selfish behavior may be off putting to the viewer, but she still makes you care for her.  Mason has a way with the Simon one-liners; she brings out Georgia's humor that remains with her even in her blackest moments and sustains her.  At the end, she has class and gallantry as she finally takes a very hard, but positive step in her life.  She earns and deserves her Best Actress Oscar nomination, and probably should have won over Katharine Hepburn in ""On Golden Pond"".  Her co-stars Joan Hackett and James Coco both received Oscar nominations as well in the supporting categories.  Hackett is especially good as Toby Landau, the trophy wife who has always gotten by on her good looks, but has very little to fall back upon as she reaches forty and desperately tries to stop the march of time.  The final scene between Georgia and Toby on Toby's balcony is especially good, where Toby reads the riot act to Georgia while admitting the truth about herself.  Coco's Jimmy Perrino is wryly comic as the middle aged actor who is getting nowhere, but yet can't move on to something else.  Georgia, Toby, and Jimmy are three incomplete flawed individuals who are all in their own way dependent on one another to make each other whole and survive in a cold world. Both Toby and Jimmy are both enablers of Georgia's bad behavior, and although Toby finally comes to the realization and puts a stop to it, Jimmy is still continuing at the film's conclusion.  Kristy McNichol as Polly gives what is probably her best performance in her limited career, a caring daughter who finally is wearied of playing the parent to an irresponsible mother, yet can't help loving her.Since I grew up on Long Island, and worked in and knew New York City quite well I'm partial to films that are shot in and around Manhattan, and this one doesn't disappoint.  Although most of the movie was shot in the studio in Hollywood, there are snapshots of the Upper West Side, the Theatre District, and the East Side of New York City circa 1980.  I particularly liked the final scene set in the now sadly defunct NY landmark the restaurant ""Tavern on the Green"", when the camera pans back and we have a view of the Central Park foliage in its entire golden autumnal splendor.This is one of those forgotten films that are worth a second look and reevaluation, and considering some of the trash that is brought out on DVD/Blueray, absolutely deserves to be brought out in the same formats, ideally with a commentary by Marsha Mason and Kristy McNichol since sadly Joan Hackett and James Coco are long gone.",4,"""Polly when I grow up, I want

Written by her then husband, Neil Simon, and taken from his original stage play, ""The Gingerbread Lady"", it is full of witty New York theater repartee, as only Simon could write, incomprabley delivered by Marsha Mason. It starts with ""Georgia's"" somewhat premature (fresh out of rehab) re-immersion into the world of theater via the starring role in a somewhat biographical play, written by her former lover , with whom she had the turbulent relationship that preceded her breakdown. Through the emotion of that experience, and her relapse, she is accompanied by her two best friends, also wonderfully played by James Coco and Joan Hackett. Their 3 way friendship would be called co-dependent nowadays, then...it was just being a supportive good friend. (I think we were better off without the present definition.) You will want these kooky, dear, flawed people as your friends. Kristy McNichol projects just the right quality as the on-the-ball off-spring. Georgias attempts to re-establish a relationship and trust with her previously somewhat ignored daughter are very funny and very touching, with McNichol often ending up as the parental figure. This is just a wonderful, under-rated little gem of a movie, a sweet story in which Marsha Mason gives one of the best performances I've seen. I consider her a terrific actress, and it's a shame that, for whatever reason, she is not creating more wonderful roles. She takes a good story and makes it great.
