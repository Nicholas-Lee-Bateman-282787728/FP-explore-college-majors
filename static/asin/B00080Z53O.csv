Based on a true story, Ramon Sampedro had a life-altering terrible accident as a young man when he took a dive into the ocean, just as the undertow took the water away.  Frightening, the consequences led to his pariplegic state and confinement to a bed for the next few decades.Winner of numerous awards, including Best Foreign Film at the 2005 Oscars, Goya Awards, and Global Awards, you might recognize Javier Bardem from ""Mondays in the Sun"", and  ""Before Night Falls.""  The leading lady, Belen Rueda, is one of Spain's popular TV personalities.  Bardem, at the time of filming was only 35 and with excellent makeup, he was made to appear 55, the age of Ramon Sampedro.A story of love, death, life, dignity and freedom.  There are those who love him enough to help him and those who stubbornly challenge his right to die.  Embarking on a journey, fraught with legal hurdles, in between, he embraces his dreams of flying beyond his window to the beautiful see he loved.  Flying over the sea is symbolic of freedom of life without constraints.If you are new to foreign film, you will see that this has clearly labeled subtitles, a great benefit to your movie pleasure.

897214,A38F6UBQJI9QG1,B00080Z53O,"C. Copeland ""Film Fanatic""","[2, 8]","Genre: Foreign, DramaGenre Grade: B-Final Grade: BThis film, based on a true story, won the Oscar for Best Foreign-Language Film this year but how it succeeded in this I am not sure. While it was a very good and at times powerful film, it seemed to miss the mark completely in making me feel anything for the main character, Ramon (played by Javier Bardem). When you are making a movie about euthanasia you have got to set the audience up for accepting the end (since not many of them are going to be fans of it in this day and age). By the end of the movie I was ready for them to kill him off no matter how it happened because I just didn't think this man had a strong enough desire to die.Before I go any further I will say that I myself support euthanasia, but I do so very lightly. I have always thought that if someone wanted to kill themself that they have every right to because it is their own life and not the life of someone else. While I still think that suicide is morally wrong, I think it's something that the person attempting it is the only one who truly understands the situation. No one can TELL someone the correct way to feel. When you step into assisted suicide, I agree it is a completely different thing, but I still think that living your own life is a right, and so we all have the right to end our life. A person such as a quadripeligic should have this same right, and I believe he or she should be given the opportunity to commit suicide despite their physical inability to do so. If someone prepares an injection, for example, and then builds a mechanism to allow the person to finish the act, I think that is one (and possibly the only) proper way of going about euthanasia. While I'm still finding my feet in how I feel about the issue, I do know I support it.So why does all that matter in this movie? Because I think that in real life, a person who attempts suicide always has an opportunity to back out, and euthanasia is such a hot political topic that I think it might pressure some into doing this. While I don't know if that was the case here, I just didn't think the movie proved to ME, at least, that Ramon truly hated life enough that he wanted to end it all. He brightened the lives of many around him, but his love for them all was not enough to keep his spirit from wanting to die. And so this confused me, and left me not enjoying the film as much as I think I might have.The acting and cinematography were absolutely amazing though.

On the positive side we probably learned everything we ever needed to know about the conservatives thanks to that flare up. We learned that they are so angry and drunk with power that they feel they can unnecessarily attack one of their own (Clint Eastwood), while at the same time being so culturally tone deaf that they were picking on the wrong movie.  Also, ""Million Dollar Baby""-gate plus the Terri Schiavo incident should put to rest any notion that conservatives stand up for personal freedom. As far as this film goes, it is a good movie, but really can't stand up to ""Million Dollar Baby"" in any way. Dealing with the real life struggle of one man to end his life, it spends more time playing around with his personal life than actually debating the issue. Of course the movie is at it's best when it is debating the issue, as in the scene when Ramon stands up to the priest (if only we could get the Democrats to stand up to the Republicans). Also, the movie does not try to whitewash the dilemma. More than one character chooses life, and that makes the movie all the stronger. The ending of this movie is also very touching, as when Ramon sits in front of the sea before his death. You realize then that he was lucky to find a friend who was not so in love with themselves to help him end his struggle. On the downside, this movie does seem to fall victim to ""Barbarian Invasion"" (a movie I really did not care for) syndrome. In that film the whole fantasy was that when you die you'll be surrounded by all those that you love (even your wife and mistress simultaneously). If that film was a fantasy, then this movie is a super sized fantasy, because here Ramon lies on his death bed while the women around him fight for his attention. I'm sure when I look like that I'll  be lucky if my one girlfriend is still hanging around. The movie was also a wee bit melodramatic, but all that is forgiven because this movie has a heart and a mind.

But it is a tender and nuanced treatment of the subject that raises the major questions and includes the major stakeholders--the legal system, a religious priest who is caricatured as moralistic and uncaring, friends, and a three-generation family that lives with and cares for the quadriplegic Ramon, who after a diving accident 26 years ago wants to end his life since, he insists, it is a life with no dignity.

Luckily this was not the case, in large part due to the decidedly un-Hollywoodish Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar (whose ""Abre Los Ojos"" was far superior to ""Vanilla Sky"" the Hollywood remake of it) which keeps lots of zingy humor and vivid color in front of us rather than going for the cheap tear-jerking hooks.

897223,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00080Z53O,Ed Uyeshima,"[23, 24]","With his outsize facial features and unremitting soulfulness, Javier Bardem is a supremely adroit actor, who reminds me quite a bit of a mid-century Anthony Quinn in that they share chameleonic abilities and earthy charisma. As he proved with his stunning portrayal of Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas in 2001's ""Before Night Falls"", Bardem can bring resonance to a real-life character and imbue him with a palpable humanistic spirit. In this film, he plays quadriplegic Ram&oacute;n Sampedro, who traveled the world in his youth as a seaman and then suffered a tragic dive off a cliff which left him paralyzed. For thirty years, Sampedro's brother and sister-in-law took care of him on their farm in Galicia, and his one unresolved wish is to die with dignity rather than face another day not being able to move anything more than his head. The controversial issue of euthanasia has been addressed numerous times, most recently in Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"". It continues to be a hot topic stateside, but perhaps because of its Spanish perspective, director/writer Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar has fashioned a story that seems less issue-oriented and more about how Sampedro infused those around him with a transformative sense of life's possibility.  There is something quite profound about this subtly observed irony, and Amen&aacute;bar, along with co-writer Mateo Gil, seems intent on challenging us to share Sampedro's single-minded perspective while empathizing with the increasing grief his loved ones feel for his approaching loss.Bardem is a wonder as usual, as he convincingly portrays a man in his mid-fifties who can only show his emotions from the neck up, especially through his large expressive eyes, yet you get a charged sense of the life-force that fed his curiosity about the world and his love of the sea. An excellent make-up job by Jo Allen is only part of it, as he gets deep under the skin of Sampedro. Bel&eacute;n Rueda poignantly plays his soul-mate Julia, the beautiful lawyer who is battling her own serious illness while helping Sampedro prepare his case to challenge the anti-euthanasia laws. She is hired because he believes she will be especially sympathetic to his cause, which proves true to a degree that makes her seriously examine her own fate. There is a lovely fantasy scene when Sampedro gets to his feet, and then the camera takes his perspective of running toward the window and flying out the window across the countryside to meet Julia on the beach where they passionately embrace. This is all done to the accompaniment of Puccini's ''Nessun dorma"", and Amen&aacute;bar miraculously bypasses contrivance to achieve something transcendent. As Rosa, the young single mother who becomes infatuated with Sampedro when she sees him on TV, Lola Due&ntilde;as (the nurse from Almod&oacute;var's ""Talk to Her"") provides an effective common-folk counterpoint to Julia, and the story has us wonder which woman will eventually help Sampedro with the final deed. They are almost yin and yang to Sampedro - Julia is cool and glamorous, while Rosa is talkative and needy. His immediate family is equally torn about Sampedro's decision, and Mabel Rivera stands out as Sampedro's selfless, attentive sister-in-law. Clara Segura also shines as Gen&eacute;, a pro-choice activist who dances the precipitous line between personal and professional with alternate strokes of alacrity and regret.  Credit also needs to go to cinematographer Javier Aguierresarobe, who seems to bathe the movie in subtle lights and colors to match the varying moods of each scene.The extras on the DVD include a Spanish-language commentary track by Amen&aacute;bar, which unfortunately has not been translated into English. I suppose it's a marketing reality that the DVD cover (movie poster), as well as the main menu and movie trailer included in the package, all highlight the youthful Bardem from the brief flashback scenes of his pre-accident existence. Regardless, there are three valuable deleted scenes of which I think one, ""Julia Changes Her Mind"", should have been reinstated to better understand her character's ambiguity toward the end of the film. There is a comprehensive making-of documentary which I found fascinating, in particular, for Bardem's intensive preparation for the role and the touching video footage of the real Sampedro. Amen&aacute;bar has made a deeply provocative film provided light and gravitas by a searing Bardem.

All of the supporting characters are beautifully realized, and we can easily relate to his affection for them, as well as his distress at the loss of dignity and privacy that flows from being entirely dependent on them.

I would choose death in a heart beat! I believe in life of course because it's a gift from God.

Sure it's a wonderful movie and I feel all should watch it at least once to learn what life is REALLY all about because this movie will make you think but as for it being a GREAT movie I wouldn't rate it that high. The performance Bardem did of the lead character is just amazing. He's truly one of the best actors on this planet. Love almost all of his movies. This one is truly one of his best.

He is tired of depending on others and yet he loves his family and those around him who did so much to make his life meaningful. Initially, he hires a lawyer to bring his case to court, to try to end his life legally. His lawyer is a woman, Julia, who has a disability which the viewer later learns is a chronic debilitating heart condition. She empathizes with Ramon's situation and begins to appreciate his finer qualities as she delves into his past and how it affects him when disabled. She wants to understand him as a total human being, not just a person with a handicap. Ramon also develops a relationship with another woman named Rose, who learns of his plight and visits him often.  She becomes the person who perhaps comes closest to meeting his emotional needs ...The film is shot artistically and realistically ... Alejandro Amendabar, the film producer, director, and creater of the musical score did a fabulous job of making a film which tackles a difficult subject - euthanasia. He made a film which shows the dignity of a human being who had a serious health problem, who made a conscious decision which few around him could accept. The personality of Ramon shines within this film. Javier Bardem plays Ramon showing a person who has a sense of humor as well as all human traits. Most amazing is how Javier Bardem holds his body stiffly, keeps his hands contracted, and his back arched, looking exactly like a paralyzed person. The views outside Ramon's window are stunning ... When he daydreams of flying and having a fully functioning body, the scenery of the mountains, streams, and shoreline of the beach are spectacular.The ethics and conflicts which Ramon faces are felt by his family and everyone associated with his case. Julia and her assistant review the current laws and recognize the challenges which they will be facing when his case is brought to court. They want Ramon to go before the judges and explain his views ... believing in person he may sway them to understand his plight. Ramon has not been outside for many years and hates wheelchairs. Yet he sees this may be his best option to achieve his goal. He makes design alterations to his wheelchair which his family builds for him. He goes to court, the cameras are rolling ... His lawyers plead his case but the judges on a legal technicality, deny Ramon any time to speak. His request to die with dignity at a time of his choosing becomes the top news on television, the radio and in the newspapers ... A Catholic priest who is also paralyzed and in a wheelchair presents the case for life and surmizes before the cameras that perhaps Ramon has not received enough love from his family and is looking for this ... Manuela, his sister-in-law who has cared for Ramon during most of his paralysis is offended and hurt by the priest's allegations. She gets a chance to confront him, when the priest makes a visit to discuss Ramon's decision with him personally ... Ramon is confronted by his brother who adamantly states, that as head of the family, he will not allow anyone to kill himself in his house. The emotional toll of his decision on the family is shown fully and with sensitivity. It happens that at the end Ramon chooses to leave his home with one of his women friends to visit a seaside resort. This is where his final days are spent.The point of the film was to present life as it is lived from the POV of Ramon a paraplegic who is totally dependent on others. The whole idea was that in a mainly Catholic society (Spain) there was ONE person who stood *against* the majority (who believed it is a sin to commit suicide).

897227,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00080Z53O,Grady Harp,"[16, 19]","THE SEA INSIDE (MAR ADENTRO) is, for this reviewer,  simply one of the most powerful films ever made.  Director Alejandro Amenabar (with co-writer with Mateo Gil) has created a work of such power and beauty that surely it will capture all of the highest awards for which it is nominated.Based on the life of Spanish writer Ramon Sampedro, a man who at age 26 suffered a broken neck from a dive into the sea with subsequent quadriplegia, the story is about life and the sanctity of the gift of being a whole person.  Sampedro lay for nearly thirty years in a bed, able move only his head, requiring assistance for every bodily function except his richly gifted brain and verbal communication - which he was able to transpose to the written word by means of an ingenious pencil/stick held in his teeth.  Having lived the life of a world traveler, a free spirit who chose to squeeze all the beauty of living from his participation in the world, Sampedro finds himself at the mercy of those who attend him and it is his wish to end his life with dignity: he searches for someone who will help him and love him enough to assist his longed for suicide.The major debate over euthanasia or assisted suicide may be the apparent message of this miraculous film, but in the hands of Amenabar and particularly in the profoundly empathetic and multifaceted performance of Javier Bardem as Ramon, THE SEA INSIDE is far more importantly a paean to the joy of living life to its fullest measure.  Ramon, despite his frustrated attempts to convince the courts that he should be allowed to die with dignity, is more concerned with touching the lives and hearts of those with whom he comes into contact.  He lives with his older brother Jose (Celso Bugallo) who adamantly opposes Ramon's wishes to die, his caretaker sister-in-law Manuela (Mabel Rivera) who supports him physically and spiritually, his father Joaquin (Joan Dalmau), and his nephew Javi (Tamar Novas).  Into this warm home Ramon's pleas for assistance bring Gene (Clara Segura) and Marc (Francesc Garrido) who aid his cause and engage a lawyer Julia (Belen Pueda), herself afflicted with a degenerative disease that leaves her with a partially paralyzed leg.  Manuela shows Julia Ramon's poetry and upon reading the poems Julia realizes he must be published  - and that she is falling in love with Ramon.One very simple person (Rosa - played by Lola Duenas) hears about Ramon's plight on a television interview and pledges herself to change Ramon's view of living. She visits him, beings him the simplicity of her heart, cares for him and tries to convince him that he should choose life over death.  Ramon's answer to his insight that Rosa is falling in love with him is to inform her that the person who truly loves him will help him exit the world with dignity.The span of the film takes over a year of the interplay of these people with Ramon's one wish and that wish becomes a cause celebre in Spain, even to the point of Padre Francisco (Jose Maria Pou), himself a quadriplegic, making a house call to present the Church's stance on euthanasia - a discourse separated by too steep stairs that is one of the more comical highlights of the story!  After failures in the courts and in convincing his family to assist him, Rosa ultimately comes to Ramon's rescue and it is this final journey that exemplifies the radiance of this film's achievement.Javier Bardem has become one of the finest, most sensitive, technically brilliant and intelligent actors on the screen today.  His performance is nothing short of miraculous: how this actor can create such a compleat character when all he has to use is his facial expression, his eyes, and his eloquent voice goes beyond any expectation a viewer might have.  Likewise, the work of the entire cast is not only the best ensemble acting achievable, but each of these gifted actors has created richly faceted performances that are utterly amazing.  Here is some of the finest acting you'll likely see in any film from any country.The cinematography captures both the claustrophobia of Ramon's Galician house and his visions/dreams of taking flight out his window to embrace his beloved sea.  The musical score is by Amenabar with a little help from Wagner, Mozart, and Puccini.  This is one of those rare films when the audience sits stunned and tearful while the credits roll at the end, not wanting to leave the aura of the experience. There is much to admire and to absorb in this brilliant film.  Were there 10 stars to award it, that would be the ranking.  Highly recommended.

But my personal reflection is this: the death is the last stage of your life, so I think it's better to re formulate the question for another one. The real important aspect is how have you lived? and not focuse exclusively in how you will die. We are in the world for living and doing everything what we can make, according our natural gifts and talents: the rest of the issue has no importance. If you have had the opportunity to follow your bliss what's the problem with dying in an early age?. I consider it's better to live a short life and productive instead a long life and improductive.So in this point I believe you must respect the personal decision of every person to turn off the light of his private existence under these horrible conditions.All the ethic considerations seem obvious while you are from the other side of the issue. It is so easy to judge the outer decisions arguing words but Do you think it is enough to talk and only for a just moment to assume his terrible position?.Amenabar built a supreme film where he presents a huge portrait about the different ethic positions; the beloved brother who denies the final solution arguing his point of view, till his lovely lawyer who will suffer a secure death.San Pedro is clearer about that issue than many of us. He got and tried to exhibit all the possible arguments and was not heard at all under legal circumstances. The discussion among the priest and Bardem is one the highlight issues of the film.Javier Bardem at this time is one of the best five actors in the Cinema world. His facial expressions are a real master class for all the acting students and the rest of the audience. His face is a real rainbow which shows all the possible frecuencies in what anima concerns.What was the unexpainable reason which avoided he was not nominated for the Academy Award by this acting? Because if you argue the theme is delicate I could remember you the Academy Award to Hanks by Philadelphia for instance, or the most recent Prize to Benigni in Life is beautiful and Adrian Brody for the Pianist. Anyway, the past now belongs to the story and this default will never hide the astonishing presence and sublime performance of this talented actor who caught with admirable eloquence the personal tragedy of a sensitive and extraordinary human being.The rest of the cast worked out to perfection level. There is no any fissure, and the edition and photograph are simply overwhelming.This is a masterpiece film and being Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar a very  young film maker, it would be risky to affirm this is his masterpiece, but if not it will be one of the three major achievements in his promising career.An artistic triumph all the way!",5,To live and die with dignity!,1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,3026,"['film', 'deserved', 'possible', 'honors', 'Prize', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'deals', 'delicate', 'very', 'personal', 'ethic', 'crossroad', 'Can', 'decide', 'lifetime', 'awful', 'painful', 'conditions', 'Obviously', 'omnipresence', 'death', 'motive', 'fear', 'anguish', 'great', 'number', 'human', 'beings', 'personal', 'reflection', 'death', 'last', 'stage', 'life', 'think', 'better', 're', 'formulate', 'question', 'one', 'real', 'important', 'aspect', 'how', 'have', 'lived', 'not', 'focuse', 'exclusively', 'how', 'will', 'die', 'are', 'world', 'living', 'doing', 'everything', 'what', 'can', 'make', 'according', 'natural', 'gifts', 'talents', 'rest', 'issue', 'importance', 'have', 'had', 'opportunity', 'follow', 'bliss', 'what', 'problem', 'dying', 'early', 'age', 'consider', 'better', 'live', 'short', 'life', 'productive', 'instead', 'long', 'life', 'improductive.So', 'point', 'believe', 'must', 'respect', 'personal', 'decision', 'person', 'turn', 'off', 'light', 'private', 'existence', 'horrible', 'conditions.All', 'ethic', 'considerations', 'seem', 'obvious', 'are', 'other', 'side', 'issue', 'so', 'easy', 'judge', 'outer', 'decisions', 'arguing', 'words', 'Do', 'think', 'enough', 'talk', 'only', 'just', 'moment', 'assume', 'terrible', 'position', '.Amenabar', 'built', 'supreme', 'film', 'where', 'huge', 'portrait', 'different', 'ethic', 'positions', 'beloved', 'brother', 'who', 'final', 'solution', 'arguing', 'point', 'view', 'till', 'lovely', 'lawyer', 'who', 'will', 'suffer', 'secure', 'death.San', 'Pedro', 'clearer', 'issue', 'many', 'got', 'tried', 'exhibit', 'possible', 'arguments', 'was', 'not', 'heard', 'legal', 'circumstances', 'discussion', 'priest', 'Bardem', 'one', 'highlight', 'issues', 'film.Javier', 'Bardem', 'time', 'one', 'best', 'five', 'actors', 'Cinema', 'world', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'real', 'master', 'class', 'acting', 'students', 'rest', 'audience', 'face', 'real', 'rainbow', 'possible', 'frecuencies', 'what', 'anima', 'was', 'unexpainable', 'reason', 'avoided', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'acting', 'argue', 'theme', 'delicate', 'could', 'remember', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Hanks', 'Philadelphia', 'instance', 'most', 'recent', 'Prize', 'Benigni', 'Life', 'beautiful', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'Pianist', 'Anyway', 'past', 'now', 'story', 'default', 'will', 'never', 'hide', 'astonishing', 'presence', 'sublime', 'performance', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'caught', 'admirable', 'eloquence', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'sensitive', 'extraordinary', 'human', 'being.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'worked', 'out', 'perfection', 'level', 'fissure', 'edition', 'photograph', 'are', 'simply', 'overwhelming.This', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'being', 'Alejandro', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'very', 'young', 'film', 'maker', 'would', 'be', 'risky', 'affirm', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'three', 'major', 'achievements', 'promising', 'career.An', 'artistic', 'triumph', 'way']","Sea Inside, The (DVD)"

It appears that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived imbalance in the film's handling of the core moral question (euthanasia).This film is, bar the final scenes, meticulous in stressing Ramon's belief that he's not making some grand point but merely that, for him, a life devoid of dignity is a life not worth living. We, as viewers, see an enormous amount of dignity in his life - we see family and friends and culture and, but for its physical limitations, a life fully lived. Central to the tragedy of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks that Ramon's life is not worth living - and that is him.To watch this film and say that the only counter argument comes from the visit of a bumbling priest is nonsense. The priest's visit is pure farce, a direct assault on the simplicity of the Spanish Catholic Church's response to the issue of euthanasia. However, the sister's parting words to the priest momentarily expose the powerful 'pro-life' sentiments quietly underpinning the entire film. We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and the beauty of a life lived with love. As the film progresses, we may gradually be encouraged to understand Ramon's reasoning but we are never reconciled to his decision. Outstanding acting by each of the actors, especially unbelievable Javier Bardem. His screen-presence has such a force that you forget that this is fiction. The movie has a wonderful rhythm and directed outstandingly.This small, quiet, harmonious movie grows into a masterpiece on human dignity.

But, on your mental scale, what value judgement would tip the balance towards the latter? THE SEA INSIDE is a forceful, emotive and sympathetic examination of assisted suicide. It's not a film for those seeking the usual Saturday afternoon pabulum of Hollywood escapism. And for those that believe that opting out of Life is never an option, it will likely be infuriating.In a Oscar-worthy performance, Javier Bardem plays Ram&oacute;n Sampedro, the Spanish poet who became a quadriplegic at age 26 when he dove into shallow waters and broke his cervical spine. In THE SEA INSIDE, it's now almost three decades later, and Sampedro is spending the last two years of his life petitioning the conservative Spanish government for the right to die with dignity via an assisted suicide. The film is an extraordinarily well acted piece by all members of the cast.The family that cares for Ram&oacute;n 24/7 includes his older brother Jos&eacute; (Celso Bugallo), his brother's wife Manuela (Mabel Rivera), his father Germ&aacute;n (Alberto Jimen&eacute;z), and his nephew Javi (Tamar Novas). Besides the dedicated Manuela, who loves Ram&oacute;n like a son, there are three other extraordinary women in his life: Julia (Bel&eacute;n Rueda, in her acting debut), the lawyer who handles Sampedro's legal case and who has a secret of her own, Gen&eacute; (Clara Segura), the representative of a national right-to-die organization, and Rosa (Lola Due&ntilde;as), the single, working mother of two that just stopped in to say hello to the invalid and ends up adoring him. Indeed, the large number of caring females in Sampedro's stunted life yields perhaps the film's only trace of humor. When jealousies simmer among the gentler sex, Ram&oacute;n discovers that he has women problems.In emotional intensity, THE SEA INSIDE transcends that other recent award-winning film about assisted suicide, THE BARBARIAN INVASION (2003). At mid-point, in a sequence of devastating power, the camera becomes a window on Sampedro's fantasy that he can leave his bed. At another time, Ram&oacute;n's bedridden helplessness is contrasted to the virile, active young man he once was through a series of old photographs examined by Julia. And the visual presentation throughout is mated to a dynamite soundtrack (that I'll definitely purchase!).This production is Spain's entry into the 2004 Academy Award competition for Best Foreign Film. If it doesn't walk away with that golden statue, then I certainly want to see the film that does.THE SEA INSIDE makes a strong case for voluntary Death with Dignity for those wishing that escape. It's certainly controversial, as evidenced by the Web sites attacking its stance. If you're looking for an intelligent, thought-provoking, sobering experience - I hesitate to use the word ""entertainment"" - see it as soon as it's released. It will likely remain in the artsy theaters and not go into wide distribution.",5,The ultimate opting out,1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,2980,"['rule', 'thumb', 'Life', 'preferable', 'Death', 'mental', 'scale', 'what', 'value', 'judgement', 'would', 'tip', 'balance', 'latter', 'SEA', 'INSIDE', 'forceful', 'emotive', 'sympathetic', 'examination', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'not', 'film', 'seeking', 'usual', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'pabulum', 'Hollywood', 'escapism', 'believe', 'opting', 'Life', 'never', 'option', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'infuriating.In', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'Sampedro', 'Spanish', 'poet', 'who', 'became', 'quadriplegic', 'age', '26', 'when', 'dove', 'shallow', 'waters', 'broke', 'cervical', 'spine', 'THE', 'SEA', 'INSIDE', 'now', 'almost', 'three', 'decades', 'later', 'Sampedro', 'spending', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'life', 'petitioning', 'conservative', 'Spanish', 'government', 'right', 'die', 'dignity', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'film', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'acted', 'piece', 'members', 'cast.The', 'family', 'Ram', 'oacute', '24/7', 'older', 'brother', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Celso', 'Bugallo', 'brother', 'wife', 'Manuela', 'Mabel', 'Rivera', 'father', 'Germ', 'aacute', 'Alberto', 'Jimen', 'eacute', 'z', 'nephew', 'Javi', 'Tamar', 'Novas', 'dedicated', 'Manuela', 'who', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'son', 'are', 'three', 'other', 'extraordinary', 'women', 'life', 'Julia', 'Bel', 'eacute', 'Rueda', 'acting', 'debut', 'lawyer', 'who', 'Sampedro', 'legal', 'case', 'who', 'secret', 'own', 'Gen', 'eacute', 'Clara', 'Segura', 'representative', 'national', 'right-to-die', 'organization', 'Rosa', 'Lola', 'Due', 'ntilde', 'single', 'working', 'mother', 'two', 'just', 'stopped', 'say', 'hello', 'invalid', 'up', 'adoring', 'Indeed', 'large', 'number', 'caring', 'females', 'Sampedro', 'stunted', 'life', 'yields', 'perhaps', 'film', 'only', 'trace', 'humor', 'When', 'jealousies', 'simmer', 'gentler', 'sex', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'discovers', 'women', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'THE', 'SEA', 'INSIDE', 'other', 'recent', 'award-winning', 'film', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'THE', 'BARBARIAN', 'INVASION', '2003', 'mid-point', 'sequence', 'devastating', 'power', 'camera', 'window', 'Sampedro', 'fantasy', 'can', 'leave', 'bed', 'time', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'bedridden', 'helplessness', 'contrasted', 'virile', 'active', 'young', 'man', 'once', 'was', 'series', 'old', 'photographs', 'examined', 'Julia', 'visual', 'presentation', 'mated', 'dynamite', 'soundtrack', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'purchase', '.This', 'production', 'Spain', 'entry', '2004', 'Academy', 'Award', 'competition', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', ""n't"", 'walk', 'away', 'golden', 'statue', 'then', 'certainly', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'SEA', 'INSIDE', 'strong', 'case', 'voluntary', 'Death', 'Dignity', 'wishing', 'escape', 'certainly', 'controversial', 'evidenced', 'Web', 'attacking', 'stance', ""'re"", 'looking', 'intelligent', 'thought-provoking', 'sobering', 'experience', 'hesitate', 'use', 'word', 'entertainment', 'see', 'as', 'soon', 'released', 'will', 'likely', 'remain', 'artsy', 'theaters', 'not', 'go', 'wide', 'distribution']","Sea Inside, The (DVD)"

This is the true story of Sampedro, played by Javier Bardem, who faught all his life so that he could commit assisted suicide.  The theme of this movie is dignity, and it throws around the idea of how a man who lives in such a state could have any.  Even though Ramon has found no reason to live, he affects everyone around him.  In one part of the film a woman who wants to befriend Ramon asks him why he's always smiling if he says that he's unhappy.  He responds by saying that living the way he does you learn to cry with a smile.  In the end, Alejandro Amenabar doesn't force his audience to pick a side over whether it's morally right for a man to commit suicide due a confined state such as Ramon's.  Yet, the audience will go on an incredible emotional journey watching Ramon and his family going through these times.  Amenabar not only wrote and directed the film, he produced, edited, and composed the score.  May I add that the film's score is one of the most beautiful film score's that I have ever heard.  If you want to hear a snipet of it then watch the trailer as it uses the score.  Overall, the movie is an intense journey through the times of one man's journey to salvage what dignity he has left, and it is a moving journey at that.ACTING: Javier Bardem is one of my favorite actors, and the transformation he makes to become the aging Sampedro is breathtaking.  The audience sees just how big of a transformation it is when the film shows flashbacks of the Ramon's accident where Bardem plays a Sampedro who is 30 years younger.  I loved Javier Bardem in The Dancer Upstairs, and some regular movie goers may recognize him from Cllateral.  Most of his career has been in Spain and he recently has appeared in some American films.  The Sea Inside has my pick for Best Foreign Language Film this year.BOTTOM LINE: An intense look at dignity in our lives that shows how different people choose to live their lives.

897241,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00080Z53O,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 7]","Infinite distance of an inch could be unbearable when one does not have the ability to provide in any form for anyone.  A mere inch might as well be in a different continent much like an endless long-distance relationship.  The difficulty of reaching for the inch results from the inability of sending signals from the from brain through the spinal cord to the motor neurons that control muscular contraction that creates movement through a number of complex levers generated through the muscles and bones.  Also, no stimulus can return to the brain that would be perceived as touch, warmth, and pain.  Thus, there is no way for a quadriplegic to openly express their thoughts through actions, as actions bear more depth than meager words.  In the Sea Inside the protagonist Ram&oacute;n Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has suffered from this sad disability for more than a quarter of a century, as he only can move his facial muscles.""Relax..."" is the first word of the film, which sets an ironic tone due to Ram&oacute;n's disability.  However, the word's purpose is of serenity, as the voice of Gen&eacute; (Clara Segura), tries to induce mental state that can help Ram&oacute;n dream and imagine of how life could have been if he never were injured.  This scene illustrates the power of the mind, as Ram&oacute;n drifts into his personal paradise where the waves of the ocean brush the perfect beach while the water gently sweeps over his feet during his walk.  His stroll along the beach provides an opportunity for him to feel the warm wind run between his fingers and against his skin.  Everything is perfect, until reality returns in form of a thunderstorm outside.  Only the mind can create these sensations in artificial manners such as dreaming.  In reality, Ram&oacute;n needs help with basic needs such as sleep, food, water, and toilet visits which requires continuous loyal support.  For example, someone must turn him or he will most likely suffer a bed soars that could give him an infection.  His lives a life with constant distance where privacy does no longer exists, as time simply passes before him.Over time Ram&oacute;n has learned that crying does not sooth his pain within, as he must rely on others.  As a result, Ram&oacute;n smiles whenever he cries, and he does a lot of smiling throughout the film.  When Julia (Bel&eacute;n Rueda), a lawyer that will help Ram&oacute;n to achieve his ultimate goal in life, which is to end his life asks the question why he desires to die Ram&oacute;n replies that he wants to die because his life offers him no dignity.  However, in order to help push through a law that could help euthanasia for Ram&oacute;n, she must dig deeper into his psyche and his identity.  Through the portrayal of Ram&oacute;n the audience learns that he was an active person who loved his freedom while traveling the world.  His dreams of the ocean and being able to fly enhances his desire for freedom, which he cannot obtain.The film continues to propose notions about love, freedom, death, and life.  Rosa (Lola Due&ntilde;as), a factory worker and radio host, becomes heavily involved with Ram&oacute;n, but through her fear of loosing him she persists to keep him alive.  Instead of being loving and accepting the others wishes, she becomes selfish and through her selfishness Ram&oacute;n remains a prisoner to life.  Ram&oacute;n has a similar relationship to his brother.  There is also an interesting scene in the film is when a quadriplegic priest visits Ram&oacute;n and tries to convince him that life is worth living.  Throughout the discussion between the two men the priests says, ""Freedom without a life is not freedom.""  Ram&oacute;n counters with ""A life without freedom is not a life.""  This might sound slightly arrogant by Ram&oacute;n, but he also does not judge others, as he simply wants to live with dignity.  These ideas and many others offer a poignant solution to what he wants and what others want, which offers much to ponder.Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar directs an absolutely amazing film that brings the audience a taboo topic up close and personal.  Previously, Amen&aacute;bar has directed terrific films such as the frightful Thesis (1996) and brilliant visual maze Open Your Eyes (1997).  This time he continues to show improvement in his skills as a filmmaker, as many viewers will probably see much more from this up and coming director.

Bernabo,"[4, 5]","Your personal position on euthanasia will probably determine whether or not you consider the life of Ram&oacute;n Sampedro to be inspirational.  But his story as told in &quot;Mar adentro&quot; (&quot;The Sea Inside&quot;) certainly provides food for thought.  Ram&oacute;n became a quadriplegic at the age of 26 and when this 2004 film begins he has spent even more years confined to a bed.  He could be in a wheelchair, but Ram&oacute;n refuses.  What he wants is for the Spanish courts to grant him the right to die.  His reason is that he does not find the life he is living to be one of dignity.  Ram&oacute;n does not judge those who are in a situation similar to his own who want to go on living, but for him life has become unbearable and he wants to have the dignity that he is denied in life by dying.The great irony is that for the most part you would not know this his life was so unbearable to look at Ram&oacute;n (Javier Bardem, in a wonderfully understated and captivating performance).  He is articulate and smiles often, showing both wit and humor in his conversations with others.  Ram&oacute;n can still write, using a pen that he holds in his mouth.  Far from being neglected, his sister-in-law, Manuela (Mabel Rivera), has been taking good care of him, aided by her son, Javi (Tamar Novas).  But his brother, Jos&eacute; (Celso Bugallo), wants Ram&oacute;n to stop talking about wanting to die and their father wonders how a son of his could want to give up on life.  Still, Ram&oacute;n thinks mainly of the empty part of the glass of life and is pushing  his case in court against a legal system that apparently wants nothing to do with him or his thorny issue.What is different at this point in his quest are two women who become involved in Ram&oacute;n's life.  Julia (Belen Rueda), is a lawyer who is suffering from a degenerative disease and he has picked her because he thinks she will be more sympathetic to his cause.  What he does not anticipate is that they would fall in love with each other.  Then there is Rosa (Lola Duenas), a local woman who decides she has to visit him and becomes part of his support group as well, even if articulating her motives is beyond her capability.  The addition of this two women changes things for Ram&oacute;n who insists that the greatest show of love his family and friends can have for him is to allow him to die.  Trapped by the refusal of any one friend to do all that he needs, Ram&oacute;n finds a way to make their piecemeal support enough.&quot;Mar adentro&quot; does a good job of presenting both sides of the issue.  The only party to the dispute that comes out looking bad are the courts, that seem to prefer sidestepping the issue by ruling on technicalities rather than making a direct ruling.  Ultimately, what Ram&oacute;n has going for him is that he is so reasonable.  His anger is usually reserved for Javi on such mundane points of life as the placement of a comma in a sentence, and there is only one night where Ram&oacute;n sinks into the depths of despair and cries out in the night, asking why it is that he wants to die.  But there are other sequences in the film that answer that question, showing through the literal flights of Ram&oacute;n's imagination the maddening limitations of his daily routine.  In the end, Alejandro Amenabar's film does not ask you to either endorse or accept Ram&oacute;n's decision, but simply to understand its rationality.",4,Ram&oacute;n Sampedro wishes to be allowed to die with dignity,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,3451,"['personal', 'position', 'euthanasia', 'will', 'probably', 'determine', 'not', 'consider', 'life', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'Sampedro', 'be', 'inspirational', 'story', 'told', 'quot', 'Mar', 'adentro', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sea', 'Inside', 'quot', 'certainly', 'food', 'thought', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'became', 'quadriplegic', 'age', '26', 'when', '2004', 'film', 'spent', 'even', 'more', 'years', 'confined', 'bed', 'could', 'be', 'wheelchair', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'What', 'Spanish', 'courts', 'grant', 'right', 'die', 'reason', 'not', 'find', 'life', 'living', 'be', 'one', 'dignity', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'not', 'judge', 'who', 'are', 'situation', 'similar', 'own', 'who', 'want', 'go', 'living', 'life', 'become', 'unbearable', 'have', 'dignity', 'denied', 'life', 'dying.The', 'great', 'irony', 'most', 'part', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'unbearable', 'look', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'captivating', 'performance', 'articulate', 'smiles', 'often', 'showing', 'wit', 'humor', 'conversations', 'others', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'can', 'still', 'write', 'using', 'pen', 'mouth', 'Far', 'being', 'neglected', 'sister-in-law', 'Manuela', 'Mabel', 'Rivera', 'been', 'taking', 'good', 'care', 'aided', 'son', 'Javi', 'Tamar', 'Novas', 'brother', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Celso', 'Bugallo', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'stop', 'talking', 'wanting', 'die', 'father', 'how', 'son', 'could', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'Still', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'mainly', 'empty', 'part', 'glass', 'life', 'pushing', 'case', 'court', 'legal', 'system', 'apparently', 'nothing', 'do', 'thorny', 'issue.What', 'different', 'point', 'quest', 'are', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'become', 'involved', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'life', 'Julia', 'Belen', 'Rueda', 'lawyer', 'who', 'suffering', 'degenerative', 'disease', 'picked', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'cause', 'What', 'not', 'anticipate', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'Then', 'Rosa', 'Lola', 'Duenas', 'local', 'woman', 'who', 'visit', 'part', 'support', 'group', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'articulating', 'motives', 'capability', 'addition', 'two', 'women', 'changes', 'things', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'who', 'greatest', 'show', 'love', 'family', 'friends', 'can', 'have', 'allow', 'die', 'Trapped', 'refusal', 'one', 'friend', 'do', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'way', 'make', 'piecemeal', 'support', 'enough.', 'quot', 'Mar', 'adentro', 'quot', 'good', 'job', 'presenting', 'sides', 'issue', 'only', 'party', 'dispute', 'out', 'looking', 'bad', 'are', 'courts', 'seem', 'prefer', 'sidestepping', 'issue', 'ruling', 'technicalities', 'rather', 'making', 'direct', 'ruling', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'going', 'so', 'reasonable', 'anger', 'usually', 'reserved', 'Javi', 'such', 'mundane', 'points', 'life', 'placement', 'comma', 'sentence', 'only', 'one', 'night', 'where', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'sinks', 'depths', 'despair', 'cries', 'out', 'night', 'asking', 'why', 'die', 'are', 'other', 'sequences', 'film', 'question', 'showing', 'literal', 'flights', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'imagination', 'maddening', 'limitations', 'daily', 'routine', 'end', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'film', 'not', 'ask', 'either', 'endorse', 'accept', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'decision', 'simply', 'understand', 'rationality']","Sea Inside, The (DVD)"

Also, having followed Javier Bardem since his early days with Bigas Luna and Pedro Almodovar, and after his extraordinary performance in ""Before Night Falls"", any new project he did was something to be reckoned with. Fate brought Barden and Amenabar together for one of the most touching movies since ""Big Fish"" (for me at least).The story of ""The Sea Inside"" (""Mar Adentro"", in Spanish) is based on the life of Ram&oacute;n Sampedro. His story could be the story of any of us. An unfortunate accident when he was young left him paraplegic for over 30 years. During this time, besides composing some beautiful poetry and dreaming of flying toward the sea while staring out his window, Sampedro battled the system to get permission to have an assisted death (euthanasia). Unbelievable moments abound in the movie, which will shock you, make you cry and make you ponder, such as his statement in response to the Jesuit priest that came to visit him to talk him out of his decision: ""Una vida sin libertad, no es una vida."" (A life without liberty is not a life).One thing is for sure. Whether you agree with the statements made in the movie or not, Amenabar has definitely done it again (as the director, co-writer, co-producer and scorer for the movie).

Based on a true story of a Spaniard who has been disabled since a neck injury 30 years prior, Ramon Sampedro (played to perfection by Javier Bardem from ""When Night Falls"") embarks upon a political journey to end his life legally.  Ramon is surrounded by three strong women (his mother, a lover `wanna-be' and a  journalist) and a loving family.  His insights are thoughtful and beautiful, with director Alejandro Amenabar (""The Others"", ""Permanent Midnight""), flashing a fantastic style ranging from heartfelt close-ups to wild flying scenes against the backdrop of the Spanish countryside and seaside.  Whether one agrees with Ramon's decision is irrelevant to the story, as it is all about celebrating life.  The truly human dialogue backed with brilliantly subtle cinematography is refreshing.

897250,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00080Z53O,mirasreviews,"[9, 9]","""The Sea Inside"" is the true story of Ram&oacute;n Sampedro, a quadriplegic whose petition for the right to kill himself brought his cause to the public eye in Spain in the 1990s. When the movie opens, Ram&oacute;n (Javier Bardem) has been paralyzed from the neck down for 26 years, the victim of a diving accident in 1968. He lives in his bed, in his brother's home, surrounded by books, music, and one window, taken care of by his sister-in-law Manuela (Mabel Rivera). Ram&oacute;n writes poetry and receives visitors, but wants to die, as he finds life without dignity intolerable and real life ""a false hope, a dream"". With the help of Gen&eacute; (Clara Segura), a tireless woman who works for a right-to-die organization, and a lawyer, Julia (Bel&eacute;n Rueda), whose own degenerative neurological disease makes her sympathetic to his cause, Ram&oacute;n takes his petition for assisted suicide to court.The events of the film take place over about 2 years, during which we see Ram&oacute;n's spirited personality and his helplessness, as well as the impact of his condition on his family. We travel through his imagination and back to his accident. Ram&oacute;n publishes a book of poetry, while he wages a media campaign to garner support for his petition. The story we see in this film is partially fictionalized. Julia is  a composite of several women, and Ram&oacute;n's nephew Javier is a composite of his numerous nephews and nieces. Gen&eacute; is a real person, but she was not pregnant during the events of the film. The scene is which Ram&oacute;n is visited by a priest combines a couple of different incidents with dialogue taken from published debates. The basic true storyline has been preserved, but more license has been taken for thematic and dramatic purposes than I usually find in a biopic.""The Sea Inside""'s great strengths are Javier Bardem's performance and the way in which director Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar is able to visually link Ram&oacute;n's real life to his imagination. As you might expect, the man often lived in his dreams. Bardem is convincing as a man 20 years older than himself -with the aid of good makeup. And his lively, charismatic, but sad performance seem to perfectly convey the real Ram&oacute;n's personality, as far as I can tell from film clips that I've seen of the real man. The actors who portray Ram&oacute;n's family all give fine performances, but Mabel Rivera's reserved interpretation is especially impressive. ""The Sea Inside"" is a little too neatly contrived in places and too melodramatic in others, which I felt were weaknesses. To some degree, this was intentional, as director Amen&aacute;bar wanted to incorporate the melodramatic and humorous aspects of Ram&oacute;n's personality into the film. ""The Sea Inside"" won nearly 40 cinema awards worldwide in 2005. It swept Spain's Goya Awards and took the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. It wasn't the best foreign film of 2005, but it's a thoughtful portrait of Ram&oacute;n Sampedro and his family with an outstanding performance by Javier Bardem.The DVD (New Line 2005 release): Bonus features include a making-of documentary, an audio commentary, 3 galleries, 3 deleted or alternate scenes, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). ""A Trip to The Sea Inside"" (1 hour, 25 minutes) is a way-too-long documentary that traces the making of this film from writing the script, through pre-production, casting, planning, filming, and post-production. There are interviews with cast, crew, and writers, but the most prominently featured interview subjects are director Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar and producer Fernando Bovaira. I found the information about Javier Bardem preparing for his role the most interesting, but this documentary needed to be edited down to half its length. The ""Photo Gallery"" contains Ram&oacute;n's photos from the movie and some on-set stills. The ""Storyboard Gallery"" is 32 black-and-white drawings for the scene of Ram&oacute;n's accident. The ""Set Design Gallery"" contains 17 color drawings. There is a good audio commentary by Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar that is more informative than the documentary. Amen&aacute;bar discusses creative and narrative decisions, casting, characters, themes, and the presence of death in his films. The commentary is in Spanish with subtitles. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.",4,Bardem Shines as a Man Condemned to Life Against His Will.,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,4376,"['Sea', 'Inside', 'true', 'story', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'Sampedro', 'quadriplegic', 'petition', 'right', 'kill', 'brought', 'cause', 'public', 'eye', 'Spain', '1990s', 'When', 'movie', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'been', 'paralyzed', 'neck', 'down', '26', 'years', 'victim', 'diving', 'accident', '1968', 'bed', 'brother', 'home', 'surrounded', 'books', 'music', 'one', 'window', 'taken', 'care', 'sister-in-law', 'Manuela', 'Mabel', 'Rivera', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'poetry', 'visitors', 'die', 'life', 'dignity', 'intolerable', 'real', 'life', 'false', 'hope', 'dream', 'help', 'Gen', 'eacute', 'Clara', 'Segura', 'tireless', 'woman', 'who', 'right-to-die', 'organization', 'lawyer', 'Julia', 'Bel', 'eacute', 'Rueda', 'own', 'degenerative', 'neurological', 'disease', 'sympathetic', 'cause', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'petition', 'assisted', 'suicide', 'court.The', 'events', 'film', 'take', 'place', '2', 'years', 'see', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'spirited', 'personality', 'helplessness', 'as', 'well', 'impact', 'condition', 'family', 'travel', 'imagination', 'back', 'accident', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'book', 'poetry', 'media', 'campaign', 'garner', 'support', 'petition', 'story', 'see', 'film', 'partially', 'fictionalized', 'Julia', 'composite', 'several', 'women', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'nephew', 'Javier', 'composite', 'numerous', 'nephews', 'nieces', 'Gen', 'eacute', 'real', 'person', 'was', 'not', 'pregnant', 'events', 'film', 'scene', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'visited', 'priest', 'couple', 'different', 'incidents', 'dialogue', 'taken', 'published', 'debates', 'basic', 'true', 'storyline', 'been', 'preserved', 'more', 'license', 'been', 'taken', 'thematic', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'usually', 'find', 'biopic', 'Sea', 'Inside', 'great', 'strengths', 'are', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'performance', 'way', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'able', 'visually', 'link', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'real', 'life', 'imagination', 'might', 'expect', 'man', 'often', 'lived', 'dreams', 'Bardem', 'convincing', 'man', '20', 'years', 'older', '-with', 'aid', 'good', 'makeup', 'lively', 'charismatic', 'sad', 'performance', 'seem', 'perfectly', 'convey', 'real', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'personality', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'clips', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'real', 'man', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'family', 'all', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'Mabel', 'Rivera', 'reserved', 'interpretation', 'especially', 'impressive', 'Sea', 'Inside', 'little', 'too', 'neatly', 'contrived', 'places', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'others', 'felt', 'were', 'weaknesses', 'degree', 'was', 'intentional', 'director', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'wanted', 'incorporate', 'melodramatic', 'humorous', 'aspects', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'personality', 'film', 'Sea', 'Inside', 'won', 'nearly', '40', 'cinema', 'awards', 'worldwide', '2005', 'swept', 'Spain', 'Goya', 'Awards', 'took', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'foreign', 'film', '2005', 'thoughtful', 'portrait', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'Sampedro', 'family', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Javier', 'Bardem.The', 'DVD', 'New', 'Line', '2005', 'release', 'Bonus', 'features', 'include', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'audio', 'commentary', '3', 'galleries', '3', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'DVD-ROM', 'Windows', 'only', 'Trip', 'Sea', 'Inside', '1', 'hour', '25', 'minutes', 'way-too-long', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'writing', 'script', 'pre-production', 'casting', 'planning', 'filming', 'post-production', 'are', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'writers', 'most', 'prominently', 'featured', 'interview', 'subjects', 'are', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'producer', 'Fernando', 'Bovaira', 'found', 'information', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'preparing', 'role', 'most', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'needed', 'be', 'edited', 'down', 'half', 'length', 'Photo', 'Gallery', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'photos', 'movie', 'on-set', 'stills', 'Storyboard', 'Gallery', '32', 'black-and-white', 'drawings', 'scene', 'Ram', 'oacute', 'accident', 'Set', 'Design', 'Gallery', '17', 'color', 'drawings', 'good', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Alejandro', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'more', 'informative', 'documentary', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'discusses', 'creative', 'narrative', 'decisions', 'casting', 'characters', 'themes', 'presence', 'death', 'films', 'commentary', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'film', 'English', 'Spanish']","Sea Inside, The (DVD)"

I'm completely unfamiliar with anything else he has filmed, but shall pursue his films more arduously based on how wonderful is this one.In the heat of the Terry Schiavo fury surrounding that poor soul and her family and her husband, this film is certainly topical, but it would resonate even if the Bush Fascists weren't trying to ramrod their putsch down the throats of one and all.This is the story of a man who has become quadripelegic as a result of a swimming accident, and now in his middle age would like to end his life. He has been a burden to his family, though they fulfill their care for him with great love and devotion. He is a source of hope for a lonely woman, and then falls in love with the lawyer who seeks his judicial approval. All of the emotions you could possibly summon are on display here through the dynamics of the various relationships. There is a sanctimonious priest who initially comes off as absurd, but then quite comically reaches a sympatico with the protagonist, not that he endorses the request for euthanasia, just the two men come to understand each other without any malice. What a concept, eh, all in its own right....The older brother can not agree with his younger brother's decision because in his heart and soul he is convinced that for all that he gave up, he'd continue to do it to care for his brother because it is the right thing to do. The protagonist wants someone to love him just enough to release him from his bonds.The music is enchanting and haunting, with the plaintive gaita of Suzanne Seivanne and Carlos Nunez on the score. The scenery of Galicia, the Celtic part of northwestern Spain, is beautiful. The acting is sublime. You will talk about this movie a lot. Its even handed treatment of the moralities involved is unblinking and compassionate and so this is a film to watch with your family, well, maybe not the kids, but anyone with whom you will be making decisions about yours or their care as Bush strips away the safety net for all Americans under a certain income level.",5,An Outstanding Film that treats the issue with dignity,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,2275,"['Having', 'just', 'seen', 'marvelous', 'Spanish', 'film', 'Phoenixville', 'places', 'home', 'Blob', 'am', 'entirely', 'moved', 'passionate', 'sympathy', 'brought', 'sides', 'euthanasia', 'issue', 'extraordinary', 'writer', 'director', ""'m"", 'completely', 'unfamiliar', 'anything', 'else', 'filmed', 'shall', 'pursue', 'films', 'more', 'arduously', 'based', 'how', 'wonderful', 'heat', 'Terry', 'Schiavo', 'fury', 'surrounding', 'poor', 'soul', 'family', 'husband', 'film', 'certainly', 'topical', 'would', 'resonate', 'even', 'Bush', 'Fascists', 'were', ""n't"", 'trying', 'ramrod', 'putsch', 'down', 'throats', 'one', 'all.This', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'become', 'quadripelegic', 'result', 'swimming', 'accident', 'now', 'middle', 'age', 'would', 'like', 'end', 'life', 'been', 'burden', 'family', 'fulfill', 'care', 'great', 'love', 'devotion', 'source', 'hope', 'lonely', 'woman', 'then', 'love', 'lawyer', 'who', 'judicial', 'approval', 'emotions', 'could', 'possibly', 'summon', 'are', 'display', 'here', 'dynamics', 'various', 'relationships', 'sanctimonious', 'priest', 'who', 'initially', 'off', 'absurd', 'then', 'quite', 'comically', 'sympatico', 'protagonist', 'not', 'request', 'euthanasia', 'just', 'two', 'men', 'come', 'understand', 'other', 'malice', 'What', 'concept', 'eh', 'own', 'right', '.The', 'older', 'brother', 'can', 'not', 'agree', 'younger', 'brother', 'decision', 'heart', 'soul', 'convinced', 'gave', 'up', ""'d"", 'continue', 'do', 'care', 'brother', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'protagonist', 'someone', 'love', 'just', 'enough', 'release', 'bonds.The', 'music', 'enchanting', 'haunting', 'plaintive', 'gaita', 'Suzanne', 'Seivanne', 'Carlos', 'Nunez', 'score', 'scenery', 'Galicia', 'Celtic', 'part', 'northwestern', 'Spain', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'sublime', 'will', 'talk', 'movie', 'lot', 'even', 'handed', 'treatment', 'moralities', 'involved', 'unblinking', 'compassionate', 'so', 'film', 'watch', 'family', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'kids', 'anyone', 'whom', 'will', 'be', 'making', 'decisions', 'yours', 'care', 'Bush', 'away', 'safety', 'net', 'Americans', 'certain', 'income', 'level']","Sea Inside, The (DVD)"

So much so that English speakers could forget they're watching a film in Spanish. The English subtitles manage to capture the poetry of the film's Spanish script, with such lines as ""I refuse to give in to the inertia where I can only be thankful for what I've been given because I have no other choice than to accept it,"" as spoken by supporting character Julia (Belen Rueda), who faces a degenerative disease. And for Spanish speakers or the bilingual, the DVD allows you to change the subtitles to Spanish, and the Spanish subtitles are actually the same as the spoken dialogue. (Often DVDs will put in Spanish subtitles that don't match the spoken language exactly, but here that's not the case.)The DVD features a director commentary in Spanish (unfortunately with no subtitles) and excellent deleted scenes that fill in some of the holes regarding the story of Ramon's lawyer/friend Julia.The editing and cinematography is first-rate. In a montage, the quadriplegic Ramon, played by Javier Bardem, recalls how his life flashed before his eyes when he was injured; meanwhile Julia, his lawyer/friend, looks through photographs of his past in another room.The story moves quickly with slices of humor, irony, and tragedy in a film that breaks the cookie-cutter euthanasia narrative. Bardem brings a great complexity to his portrayal of Ramon in one of the most astonishing performances in years. This film has great universal appeal, but is also perfect for someone who has ever been injured for a long time or permanently, or for someone who knows or cares for someone in such a state. It brings humanity not only to euthanasia, but also to sickness and/or injury.",4,Amazingly poetic even in translation,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,1751,"['Sea', 'Inside', 'something', 'many', 'foreign', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'well', 'So', 'much', 'English', 'speakers', 'could', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'manage', 'capture', 'poetry', 'film', 'Spanish', 'script', 'such', 'lines', 'refuse', 'give', 'inertia', 'where', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'thankful', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'have', 'other', 'choice', 'accept', 'spoken', 'supporting', 'character', 'Julia', 'Belen', 'Rueda', 'who', 'degenerative', 'disease', 'Spanish', 'speakers', 'bilingual', 'DVD', 'change', 'subtitles', 'Spanish', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'are', 'actually', 'same', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'Often', 'DVDs', 'will', 'put', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'spoken', 'language', 'exactly', 'here', 'not', 'case', 'DVD', 'director', 'commentary', 'Spanish', 'unfortunately', 'subtitles', 'excellent', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'fill', 'holes', 'regarding', 'story', 'Ramon', 'lawyer/friend', 'Julia.The', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'first-rate', 'montage', 'quadriplegic', 'Ramon', 'played', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'how', 'life', 'flashed', 'eyes', 'when', 'was', 'injured', 'meanwhile', 'Julia', 'lawyer/friend', 'photographs', 'past', 'room.The', 'story', 'moves', 'quickly', 'slices', 'humor', 'irony', 'tragedy', 'film', 'cookie-cutter', 'euthanasia', 'narrative', 'Bardem', 'great', 'complexity', 'portrayal', 'Ramon', 'one', 'most', 'astonishing', 'performances', 'years', 'film', 'great', 'universal', 'appeal', 'also', 'perfect', 'someone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'injured', 'long', 'time', 'permanently', 'someone', 'who', 'cares', 'someone', 'such', 'state', 'humanity', 'not', 'only', 'euthanasia', 'also', 'sickness', 'and/or', 'injury']","Sea Inside, The (DVD)"
897255,A1D3XQC2DIT,B00080Z53O,Peter Shermeta,"[32, 33]","Winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of 2004, The Sea Inside is a fact-based story of Ram&oacute;n Sampedro, a quadriplegic man who petitions the Spanish government for his right to die. Without the use of his body for 27 years, Sampedro desires above all else the right to be euthanized. His story is taken on by an association that goes by the name of ""Die with Dignity"" which is how he has a voice in court.The story begins as a lawyer comes to Ram&oacute;n to learn his story. She has taken the case pro bono to get his wish to die granted by the courts. This is the first person we see him encounter that tries to understand him; she is not the last.Through these meetings we see how truly remarkeable Sampedro really is. We see the devices he has invented to assist him in his situation. We see the poetry his heart has poured out over the years. We are party to conversations in which he explains life and freedom of choice, he talks of a future he hopes not to have. Every person he communicates with is so deeply moved by him; it is humbling to see the effect one man may have on others.Director Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar (Open Your Eyes, The Others) brings to life this story of a man enslaved to his body. The movie is set in the house Ram&oacute;n refuses to leave, though we see incredible landscape shots and are taken on an amazing ride as Sampedro jumps out of his two story window and flies all the way to the beach. Through his eyes we see how he lingers over the blue-green water. To this former sailor, the sea represents that which gave him life and ultimately took it away.The only thing worse than your son dying before you...is him wanting to. -Joaqu&iacute;n Sampedro (Ram&oacute;n's father)This was an absolutely beautiful movie. Try as I may to exercise my vocabulary, I keep ending up with the word ""beautiful"" to describe The Sea Inside. This heart wrenching tale offers various perspectives on both life and death. If you have ever taken the time to consider either, and even if you have not, this movie will be special to you. And I will warn you that there are a few times in the movie when not crying seems unthinkable. I cannot help the feeling that in seeing this movie in the theater last night I was a part of something important.

897256,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00080Z53O,Randy Keehn,"[4, 4]","I watched ""The Sea Inside"" last night with a minimum of expectations. My interest was based on knowing that it was about a quadriplegic since I am happily married to a quadriplegic woman.  By the time the movie was over, I had been thoroughly immersed in an emotionally absorbing drama of a man and his struggles with his physical limitations.  In the course of the movie, I became very impressed with the level of character development and the quality of the relationships that emerged in the film.  The dialogue was first rate, the acting was superb and the director, well, Alejandro Amenabar was involved in virtually all aspects of the film.  I even noticed that he had the lone credit as the Musical Director.  This film is a masterpiece.Unfortunately, ""The Sea Inside"" leads, for me, to an unwanted conclusion.  That does not take anything away from the quality of the film.  It's just that I was like Rosa; wanting to explain everything I could to change Ramon's mind (not respecting the fact  that he had spent 28 years making this decision).  In reality, the quality of the charater and relationship development was the source of the reasons to persevere.  Why back out when love is all around you.  All viewers will be challenged to judge Ramon's decision but none can honestly deny that ""The Sea Inside"" gives a pretty comprehensive examination of his wishes.I thought about ""The Sea Inside"" and how it compares to Eastwood's ""Millian Dollar Baby"".  I thought ""Million Dollar Baby"" was a 5 Star film in it's brilliant depiction of Eastwood's character sacrificing everything he believed in to honor his friend's wishes.

897257,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B00080Z53O,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[0, 1]","Controversial issues can be approached humanely and aesthetic ways.  The SEA INSIDE is one particular film that accomplishes the daunting task of confronting euthanasia without overly politicizing the issue, but rather observing the beauty of life.  In this case, the real life of Ramon Sam Pedro (Javier Bardem) who became a quadriplegic after diving into an undertow in 1968.  For 26 years he struggled to live, but constantly contemplated death and the right to die with dignity.  This is the story of his 30-year struggle.The SEA INSIDE revolves around the people who have had to take care of Ramon as well as those who want to fulfill his wishes.  The movie is a circle of conflict between his family who refuse to accept Ramon's desire to die, older brother, Jose (Celso Buello), sister-in-law, Manuela (Mabel Riviera), nephew, Javi (Tomar Novas), and an admirer, Rosa (Lola Duenas), and the people who want to prove his case to the government for the right to die, his lawyer, Julia (Belen Rueda), and activist-friend, Gene (Clara Segura).  In this midst of conflicting views, Ramon harbors intimate relationships with Julia and Rosa in quite unique ways.  While interviewing Ramon, Julia takes a liking towards him despite that fact that she is married to German (Alberto Jimenzes), a friendship develops, but is only disrupted when she too suffers a debilitating state.  She contemplates death as well.  Ramon also befriends Rosa, a single mother of two young boys, who happens to become mesmerized with him after seeing him on television, but her relationship is almost fatherly or brotherly like.There are only little inklings of religious and political tones in the film, the courtroom scene, and the extremely funny segment where a quadriplegic priest visits Ramon.  But the film speaks loudly towards what Ramon's plight, not to be a burden to the people who have to take care of him, and the means it will take to achieve his ultimate goal - to have the one who really loves him who will carry out his wish.Director Alejandro Amenabar did a beautiful job at portraying Ramon's life.  The most exquisite scenes are the dream and flashbacks scenes, which Amenabar recreates from real life images of the real Ramon and his poetic renderings that were published shortly before his death.

I suspect, where The Sea Inside is concerned, there's some of both going on here.Amenabar (The Others) gives us the (true) story of Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem, Spain's greatest export), injured in a diving accident twenty-five years before and paralyzed from the neck down since, who wants only one thing: the right to end his own life without anyone getting arrested for it. Arrayed against him are, well, all the usual suspects: his family, the church, the government. Added to this is a new friend of his, a disc jockey named Rosa (Volver's Lola Duenas) who saw him on TV and has added her voice to the chorus against him. As Ramon and Rosa get to know each other better, his longtime lawyer Julia (The Orphanage's Belen Rueda) starts getting jealous.It's impossible to discuss the implications of this movie in detail without spoilers; I'll try to avoid them by saying it seemed to me that, perhaps, Amenabar himself was less than satisfied with the way the case actually turned out, and leave it at that (any examples would constitute spoilers). This cast something of a pall over the movie for me, despite all the many things going in its favor. Javier Bardem is, of course, an incredible actor, and just about anything he does is well worth your time. The interactions between Bardem, Duenas, and Rueda, in their various combinations, are fascinating, and if much of the rest of the film had been trimmed away, they would still make for an excellent piece of cinema. Not that I mean to imply, though I guess I have, that the love-triangle aspect of the movie is of any prominence (or, for that matter, much importance) in the greater scheme of things; it's a grace note at best in the midst of a symphony. But this is, perhaps, why I have been letting this film simmer in my head for almost a month without writing a review of it until now; so many of the things about which I wanted to see more were in the background, while my original reason for wanting to see the film (which, for once, wasn't Javier Bardem; I consider Ramon Sampedro a hero, despite the ultimate futility of his crusade), which did take center stage, seemed to pale in comparison.A good film, but a tough one to rate.

In my opinion, the director could not have done this without the magnificent performance of Javier Bardem, who transmits the feelings and opinions of Ramon Sampedro with such conviction and clarity that one cannot help but feel touched by the story and the issue at hand.Ramon is a quadriplegic that wants to die because he claims that living this way has no dignity. He has been prostrated in his bed for the last twenty-six years of his life after hitting the bottom of the sea and breaking his neck. The issue is not a simple one, because Ramon has a loving family and his mind works perfectly, so a lot of people in that situation, me included, would probably hold on to life. But the distinction is relevant here, since Ramon does not argue that everyone in his situation should die or desire to do so, but rather that he wants to do it, and should be allowed to. Basically, he wants to decide how to live and how to die without other people's opinions being a factor.In order to achieve his wishes, Ramon is consulting with a lawyer (Julia) to get approval from the courts. But Ramon has to battle other people beside the courts, like his brother, who cannot comprehend why Ramon is insisting on dying. As the process towards the trial begins, Ramon becomes news on TV. That is how Rosa, a local neighbor, finds out about him and decides to try to infuse him with a desire to live. Ramon's relationship with Julia and with Rosa is a central part of this movie and helps understand better his wishes and how difficult his decision is.This is a highly emotional movie that touches on complex issues and uses powerful statements on both sides, so there are no easy answers. In my case, one of the statements that left me thinking for the longest time was when Ramon said ""The person who actually loves me will be precisely the one who helps me die"". But I guess that different people will react in different ways and reach different conclusions, the important point is that the film will make you think and consider both sides of the argument. Now you just need to get ready for an emotional upheaval and plunge into the sea with the wonderful Javier Bardem.",5,"""I understand Ramon quite well""",1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,2393,"['Presenting', 'topic', 'as', 'controversial', 'one', 'touched', 'upon', 'movie', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'succeeded', 'achieving', 'balanced', 'humane', 'approach', 'issue', 'right', 'die', 'dignity', 'opinion', 'director', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'feelings', 'opinions', 'Ramon', 'Sampedro', 'such', 'conviction', 'clarity', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'touched', 'story', 'issue', 'hand.Ramon', 'quadriplegic', 'die', 'living', 'way', 'dignity', 'been', 'prostrated', 'bed', 'last', 'twenty-six', 'years', 'life', 'hitting', 'bottom', 'sea', 'breaking', 'neck', 'issue', 'not', 'simple', 'one', 'Ramon', 'loving', 'family', 'mind', 'perfectly', 'lot', 'people', 'situation', 'included', 'would', 'probably', 'hold', 'life', 'distinction', 'relevant', 'here', 'Ramon', 'not', 'argue', 'everyone', 'situation', 'should', 'die', 'desire', 'do', 'so', 'rather', 'do', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'Basically', 'decide', 'how', 'live', 'how', 'die', 'other', 'people', 'opinions', 'being', 'factor.In', 'order', 'achieve', 'wishes', 'Ramon', 'consulting', 'lawyer', 'Julia', 'get', 'approval', 'courts', 'Ramon', 'battle', 'other', 'people', 'courts', 'brother', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'why', 'Ramon', 'insisting', 'dying', 'process', 'trial', 'Ramon', 'news', 'TV', 'how', 'Rosa', 'local', 'neighbor', 'out', 'decides', 'try', 'infuse', 'desire', 'live', 'Ramon', 'relationship', 'Julia', 'Rosa', 'central', 'part', 'movie', 'understand', 'better', 'wishes', 'how', 'difficult', 'decision', 'is.This', 'highly', 'emotional', 'movie', 'complex', 'issues', 'powerful', 'statements', 'sides', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'case', 'one', 'statements', 'left', 'thinking', 'longest', 'time', 'was', 'when', 'Ramon', 'said', 'person', 'who', 'actually', 'will', 'be', 'precisely', 'one', 'who', 'die', 'guess', 'different', 'people', 'will', 'react', 'different', 'ways', 'reach', 'different', 'conclusions', 'important', 'point', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'consider', 'sides', 'argument', 'Now', 'just', 'need', 'get', 'ready', 'emotional', 'upheaval', 'plunge', 'sea', 'wonderful', 'Javier', 'Bardem']","Sea Inside, The (DVD)"

It is not a good-intentioned Hollywood production that frustratingly loses sight of its important message because of creative compromise.  It is instead a film that forces one to ponder the conflicting views on a difficult issue.Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has been trapped inside his body for twenty-eight years.  He has asked for the right to die because he believes that life as a quadriplegic is not a dignified way to live.  Ramon's brother, Jos&eacute; (Celso Bugallo) is adamantly against his decision but support is found in the form of Julia (Bel&eacute;n Rueda), Ramon's lawyer, and Rosa (Lola Due&ntilde;as), a local radio personality.  The crusade faces an uphill battle as opposition is encountered at every turn but Ramon stubbornly sticks to his guns despite the overwhelming public pressure and criticism.Bardem turns in the performance of his career as the broken but spirited Ramon.  He puts a flesh-and-blood face on the issue at-hand and effectively conveys the frustration and limitations of the quadriplegic.  The directing is equally inspired as Amen&aacute;bar is careful not to make ""The Sea Inside"" a one-sided affair.  He wisely incorporates the rational arguments against assisted suicide which greatly helps the film from becoming manipulative.  Do not get the impression that ""The Sea Inside"" is two hours of depressing storytelling though.  It is ultimately uplifting even in light of its somber subject matter.

I didn't know anything about him, but in Spain, I hear, he is very famous and the characters in this film also have the models.Considering these facts, it is amazing that 35-year-old Javier Bardem plays so convincingly the role of Ram&oacute;n who was in fact more than 50 years old at the time when the film describes.  Amen&aacute;bar's film quietly follows the last days of his life, including the budding relationship with women surrounding him (including Julia, also terminally-ill, and Rosa, devorced), the family members (showing mixed emotional reactions to his final decision), and the legal matters.[MORAL QUESTIONS] Now, here is a tough question about the moral issues dealt here.  Some professional reviewers argue, understandably to some extent, that the film is trying to manipulate the audiences, and shows the simplified views on the topic called euthanasia, or life and death.  I disagree.  For one thing, this is a fact-based film about the real person who really thought that his decision is the best one for him, so why not respect that?  It is true that 'The Sea Inside' keeps on stressing the belief of Ram&oacute;n Sampedro.  Probably, his view is not yours (and not shared by many of the characters).  If the film manipulates (as good films always do), that's because you have to see things through his eyes, to understand his life, 'life as obligation' as he describes.The acting is unanimously great, so it is pointless to name the names one by one.  I only point out that though Bardem was once Oscar-nominated for 'Before Night Falls,' it is this film that proves his enormous talent as great actor.  You see no 'sexy' or 'macho' image here.  Just the character.In the end Ram&oacute;n gets what he wants, and the descriptions of the video message recording (which really happened, and the tape was seen by many people in Spain) are very painfully realistic.  However, at the same time, Ram&oacute;n remains very attractive throughout the film because of his personality, and in fact, according to the film, more than one women visit him repeatedly.

Williams ""world traveller""","[14, 27]","This film seems to want to have it both ways - offering the premise that not all disability is disposable - just Sampedro's.An incredible amount of talent and creativity went into a film that pays homage to ... well, plainly put - a man that was too petulant to live. The movie presents Ramon Sampedro - a talented, intelligent and articulate  man as someone who ultimately proves to be a self-pitying whiner.It was not that he was not capable of living a life of accomplishment and satisfaction - he simply refused to. Despite the acclaim and admiration that his writing had brought to him, despite the devotion of those around him that loved and cared for him, Sampedro seems a bit like the child who gathers his marbles up from the playground and marches home because someone hadn't played by his rules. (Refusing a wheelchair? C'mon!)Granted, the stress, humiliation and despair of being a quadriplegic cannot be minimalized nor discounted. However, giving up on what you may have once hoped your life would be for what it ultimately becomes proves to be difficult for all of us - no matter what the size or nature of our own personal challenges.(Oddly enough the very limitations that he views as untenable are most likely the factors that pushed him to reach inside himself and find a voice that brought him such attention and celebrity. Imagine the platform that was his ... and was thrown away)Yes, yes - allow the man to end his life if he is incapable of recognizing the gift that he squandered; let us be done with him if he so chooses. We should not, however, celebrate his cowardice - the easy out - this foolish waste of something precious. What an insult this film seems to those who struggle quietly everyday with half the talents, abilities or the emotional resources of devoted family and friends that were at Sampedro's disposal.

So many people wanted to identify him as a quadriplegic and his wishes the same as other quadriplegic. He wanted to be seen as an individual and his wishes as only his wishes. He was an active man who found life as an inactive person unbearable. He only spoke for himself. He was highly intelligent man and realized that every person has their own reason why they wanted to live or die. And he was only a spokesperson for himself.

It's kind of slow-paced and depressing to see Ramon Sanpedro(Bardem) to wait in bed for thirty something years before fulfilling his wish to assisted suicide. Ramon is a renowned Spanish poet, and at the age of 26 he became a quadrilegic when he dove into the shallow end of a sea shore. Even though he couldn't see the sea from the room he lived, but he had always imagined himself getting out of bed and fly away from the window to the beautiful sea miles away. It took a lot of persuasion before his friend Rosa agreed to help him even when the government denied his request. To him, living like a vegetable is meaningless and has no dignity.This film also featured some powerful and touching performances from the supporting cast, especially Belen Rueda who played Julia(Ramon's lawyer), and Lola Duenas(Rosa). This is probably Javier Bardem's most challenging role since Before Night Fall.

897271,A1K7X23UDT0R7V,B00080Z53O,Winston D. Jen,"[1, 1]","Paralysed from the neck down for over 25 years, Ramon is trapped in a tragic prison - his own body. If he were able to move his arm, he could shoot himself and deliver himself from irrelievable, profound and intolerable existential suffering. As Ramon himself eloquently stated, ""In my dreams, the one commonality is that I can walk.""But because of ass-backwards laws in Spain, all he can do is starve himself or find people to help him, illegally. An ignorant but well-intentioned woman visits Ramon near the film's outset. She is baffled at how a man who smiles so readily could want to die. He explains that his smiles are simply a curtain over his grief, pain and tears. He soon asks the arrogant and presumptuous woman to leave. This is nothing compared to the arrogance of a quadriplegic priest, who not only has his faith to sustain him, but billions in church resources to draw upon if he should ever need to. His non-sequitor argument, that ""freedom without life isn't freedom"", ignores millennia of bloodshed and sacrifice in the name of freedom and liberty for all. I found his behaviour repugnant, especially when he countered Ramon's appeal to public support by Godwinning himself and equating that support to that provided to the Nazis by the German people.While the majority of this powerful true story concerns Ramon's fight to legalise and obtain assistance to die, other characters are crucial and unforgettable, including his family and a woman who intends to end her life before her incurable, lifelong illness becomes unbearable to her. They round out the film and create a profound and realistic three-dimensional experience.Legislative change will come, and it will come soon, as baby boomers age. A placard raised at a protest in Ramon's honour read ""Life is a right, not an obligation."" Nothing could be more true. A life that is compulsory, not to mention miserable, is torture. And paternalistic torture at the hands of the state is one of the most profoundly abhorrent kinds of torture possible.",5,Ramon Sampedro's Courageous Journey,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,2023,"['Paralysed', 'neck', 'down', '25', 'years', 'Ramon', 'trapped', 'tragic', 'prison', 'own', 'body', 'were', 'able', 'move', 'arm', 'could', 'shoot', 'deliver', 'irrelievable', 'profound', 'intolerable', 'existential', 'suffering', 'Ramon', 'eloquently', 'stated', 'dreams', 'one', 'commonality', 'can', 'walk', 'ass-backwards', 'laws', 'Spain', 'all', 'can', 'do', 'starve', 'find', 'people', 'help', 'illegally', 'ignorant', 'well-intentioned', 'woman', 'visits', 'Ramon', 'film', 'outset', 'baffled', 'how', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'readily', 'could', 'want', 'die', 'smiles', 'are', 'simply', 'curtain', 'grief', 'pain', 'tears', 'soon', 'arrogant', 'presumptuous', 'woman', 'leave', 'nothing', 'compared', 'arrogance', 'quadriplegic', 'priest', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'faith', 'sustain', 'billions', 'church', 'resources', 'draw', 'should', 'ever', 'need', 'non-sequitor', 'argument', 'freedom', 'life', ""n't"", 'freedom', 'millennia', 'bloodshed', 'sacrifice', 'name', 'freedom', 'liberty', 'found', 'behaviour', 'repugnant', 'especially', 'when', 'countered', 'Ramon', 'appeal', 'public', 'support', 'Godwinning', 'equating', 'support', 'provided', 'Nazis', 'German', 'majority', 'powerful', 'true', 'story', 'concerns', 'Ramon', 'fight', 'legalise', 'obtain', 'assistance', 'die', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'crucial', 'unforgettable', 'including', 'family', 'woman', 'who', 'end', 'life', 'incurable', 'lifelong', 'illness', 'unbearable', 'round', 'out', 'film', 'create', 'profound', 'realistic', 'three-dimensional', 'experience.Legislative', 'change', 'will', 'come', 'will', 'come', 'soon', 'baby', 'boomers', 'age', 'placard', 'raised', 'protest', 'Ramon', 'honour', 'read', 'Life', 'right', 'not', 'obligation', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'compulsory', 'not', 'mention', 'miserable', 'torture', 'paternalistic', 'torture', 'hands', 'state', 'one', 'most', 'profoundly', 'abhorrent', 'kinds', 'torture', 'possible']","Sea Inside, The (DVD)"
