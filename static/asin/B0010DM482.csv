1125116,A11PRT1CCVHB52,B0010DM482,"B. Daniel ""ComicBOOK Lover""","[1, 1]","SO I'm a fan of the games. And as a fan I always felt this series deserved an anime if not a live-action film (though THAT I doubt will ever happen). Well FUNimation and Madhouse have done us all a favor and given us a quick shot of stylish goodness in the form of Devil May Cry: The Animated Series. First off my only two complaints; too short, and no ""Devil Trigger."" Other than that it's great. Great art, decent stories and superb action. The English voice cast is pretty good too, with Rueben Langdon (credited as Justin Cause) reprising the role of Dante from the DMC3&4 games.Dante comes off just as cocky as he did in DMC3, but with the maturity that he showed in DMC4. I was really upset the show only ran 12 episodes though. Can we get an OVA or something. But I digress, this show has everything a DMC fan could want, Dante, Trish and Lady, plus new characters Morrison and Patty lighten things up and make Dante seem not so lonely.Yes it's a ""Monster of the day"" anime, but when you think of it, that's Dante's job. Going from job to job dispatching demons, and every now and then fighting a big bad, which we get at the end. As video game translations go this is one of the better ones. Unfortunately as I said no ""Devil Trigger,"" Dante's ability to become a devil for a limited time, though it apparently does happen off camera, and flashes briefly for a second.Bottom Line: If you like the series of games, get this series as a companion. Also check out the novels that expand on Dante's background.",5,STYLISH!!

On a purely fun enjoying level though, the opening volume of Devil May Cry will deliver fun characters taking part in a constant string of battles.

The series follows the day to day life of Dante, demon slayer for hirethrough his business (which is named Devil May Cry).  A lot of action, surprises, comedy moments and quite abit of Dante is explained.  Even if one never played the games... one can view the series without feeling ofsomething amiss.  Very entertaining.

To those who have played the game you will see some of the other characters like Trish and Lady as well as a new character for the anime Patty Lowell who in the first episode is being protected by Dante to make sure she gains her supposed inheritance from her father.  The English voice actors for Dante, Trish, and Patty were good but sadly the one for Lady was just terrible it seemed like she just read the lines from the script with either little or no feelings at all so it's probably best to watch most of these episodes subbed instead.

1125121,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B0010DM482,S. Der,"[0, 0]","Awesome show but it's missing one very important aspect; Dante's Devil Trigger! I thought this show would be like the video game, where in the toughest of times, Dante will need to use devil trigger form. That's when he transforms himself to his demon appearance and gain more power, speed, and skills. I don't know why they didn't do that. It was a very big part of the video game, and it would had been awesome to see.It wasn't like they didn't know about it either. They had Dante foes turn into Demon form, and that gave them more power, but Dante himself didn't do it. Does that mean he couldn't do it? I don't know because it doesn't show or explain this at all.I thought at the very end of the series that...okay. Maybe, just maybe, this will be the time. Will he finally do it? Will he...transform because it looks like he needs MORE POWER!!! Then, it happened!Nothing!!!Dante, just suddenly believes he can do anything, and he does. I don't know where he gets his sudden burst of strength & energy, but he does, and process to kick the last bad guy butt like nothing. What??? He didn't need to transform? He didn't have any energy/strength to continue on, and now we are supposed to believe he does? What in the world? He didn't need that extra boost that his devil form will give him? He had it in him all this time? Was he just playing dead? Rally? All he needed was believe in himself and someone to tell him that. BOO!There you go, he wins like nothing. That's the end of the series and WTF?This show would had got 5 stars, but is only 4 because I don't know why they didn't have Devil Trigger!!!",4,Missing 1 Thing!,1338076800,"05 27, 2012",2012,1609,"['Awesome', 'show', 'missing', 'one', 'very', 'important', 'aspect', 'Dante', 'Devil', 'Trigger', 'thought', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'video', 'game', 'where', 'toughest', 'times', 'Dante', 'will', 'need', 'use', 'devil', 'trigger', 'form', 'when', 'demon', 'appearance', 'gain', 'more', 'power', 'speed', 'skills', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'was', 'very', 'big', 'part', 'video', 'game', 'would', 'had', 'been', 'awesome', 'see.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'Dante', 'foes', 'turn', 'Demon', 'form', 'gave', 'more', 'power', 'Dante', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'mean', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""n't"", 'show', 'explain', 'all.I', 'thought', 'very', 'end', 'series', 'okay', 'Maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'Will', 'finally', 'do', 'Will', 'transform', 'MORE', 'POWER', 'Then', 'happened', 'Nothing', 'Dante', 'just', 'suddenly', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'sudden', 'burst', 'strength', 'energy', 'process', 'kick', 'last', 'bad', 'guy', 'butt', 'nothing', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'transform', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'energy/strength', 'continue', 'now', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'What', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'extra', 'boost', 'devil', 'form', 'will', 'give', 'had', 'time', 'Was', 'just', 'playing', 'dead', 'Rally', 'All', 'needed', 'was', 'believe', 'someone', 'tell', 'BOO', 'go', 'nothing', 'end', 'series', 'WTF', 'show', 'would', 'had', 'got', '5', 'stars', 'only', '4', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Devil', 'Trigger']","Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, Vol. 1"
