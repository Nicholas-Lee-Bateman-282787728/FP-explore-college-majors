One of the reviewers commented about too much drum but the music is SUPPOSED to be secondary to Desi's instruction. The DVD also provides a music option to let you turn off the instruction and just hear the music. It's a fun way to work up a sweat, the moves are easy to follow and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to mix up their cardio routine.",5,Lots of fun!,1226534400,"11 13, 2008",2008,466,"['have', 'DVD', 'other', 'Dance', 'Be', 'Fit', 'program', 'Brazilian', 'Body', 'think', 'music', 'great', 'One', 'reviewers', 'commented', 'too', 'much', 'drum', 'music', 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'secondary', 'Desi', 'instruction', 'DVD', 'also', 'music', 'option', 'let', 'turn', 'off', 'instruction', 'just', 'hear', 'music', 'fun', 'way', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'moves', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'mix', 'up', 'cardio', 'routine']",DANCE AND BE FIT: LATIN GROVE

I wanted something that would be fun to add to my daily routine of going for a mile walk and yoga. I found it in this dance workout. What I like best about it is my two daughters can spend time with me and do the workout as well and to them...it's just dancing with mom.For the advance Zumba queen, you might want something else, but for those looking into doing a dance workout for the first time or wanting a workout routine you can do with little kids in the house, I highly suggest this one. You do feel the burn but it isn't too advanced either so you can enjoy a great workout.",4,Get Up and Get Moving,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,664,"[""'m"", 'author', 'tend', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'sitting', 'front', 'computer', 'wanted', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'add', 'daily', 'routine', 'going', 'mile', 'walk', 'yoga', 'found', 'dance', 'workout', 'What', 'like', 'best', 'two', 'daughters', 'can', 'spend', 'time', 'do', 'workout', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'dancing', 'advance', 'Zumba', 'queen', 'might', 'want', 'something', 'else', 'looking', 'doing', 'dance', 'workout', 'first', 'time', 'wanting', 'workout', 'routine', 'can', 'do', 'little', 'kids', 'house', 'highly', 'suggest', 'one', 'do', 'feel', 'burn', ""n't"", 'too', 'advanced', 'so', 'can', 'enjoy', 'great', 'workout']",DANCE AND BE FIT: LATIN GROVE
1169969,A2B65FZCTSPWC2,B001B1Q2UE,Gina,"[1, 1]",I own a miriad of dance workout videos and rotate them frequently to prevent boredom.  I bought this one as an Amazon instant vid and just finished the workout.  The routines are simple so you don't have to pause the workout to learn them. Great fun!  Worked up a light sweat.  I highly recommend if you are new to dancing because the choreography is not overwhelming and you can start dancing right away.

The ""instruction"" is a voice over, and the ""dancers"" 3 robots with frozen fake smiles. The music is typical Mexican restaurant Muzak. The warm-up is way too long and repetitious; at least the 2nd workout does not begin with a warm-up. The routines are typical, uninspiring, unfun, and don't raise the heart rate. Cool down is almost 10 minutes as well, some point your toes, tai chi, yoga-inspired snooze fest. Nothing good to say about this workout, because you don't even really get a workout!

1169972,A281TPR8M7V04S,B001B1Q2UE,N. Keaton,"[0, 0]","The moves are similar to NIA and Zumba. It's Latin dance. The pace is good and it presents in 4 parts: warm-up, dance moves, more dance moves, cool down. If you were a beginner you could stop after the first set of dance moves. However, the lack is in the calls. They are not that good, even though this is &#34;over-narrated&#34; to eliminate that problem and allow continuous dance without the leader having to make the calls. My only complaint is the calls. They are mostly late, not said at all when changes are about to come and you end up floundering about trying to keep up. After about 4 or 5 runs you know them and then they become all the more annoying because they are not on cue. The one thing that none of these fitness videos do is allow you to shut off their voice once you know the moves and listen to the music without the interruption. I'd love that. I'd buy that video in a second!",4,"Need Work, but Good",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,900,"['moves', 'are', 'similar', 'NIA', 'Zumba', 'Latin', 'dance', 'pace', 'good', '4', 'parts', 'warm-up', 'dance', 'moves', 'more', 'dance', 'moves', 'cool', 'down', 'were', 'beginner', 'could', 'stop', 'first', 'set', 'dance', 'moves', 'However', 'lack', 'calls', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'even', '34', 'over-narrated', '34', 'eliminate', 'problem', 'allow', 'continuous', 'dance', 'leader', 'having', 'make', 'calls', 'only', 'complaint', 'calls', 'are', 'mostly', 'late', 'not', 'said', 'when', 'changes', 'are', 'come', 'end', 'up', 'floundering', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', '4', '5', 'runs', 'know', 'then', 'become', 'more', 'annoying', 'are', 'not', 'cue', 'one', 'thing', 'none', 'fitness', 'videos', 'do', 'allow', 'shut', 'off', 'voice', 'once', 'know', 'moves', 'listen', 'music', 'interruption', ""'d"", 'love', ""'d"", 'buy', 'video', 'second']",DANCE AND BE FIT: LATIN GROVE
