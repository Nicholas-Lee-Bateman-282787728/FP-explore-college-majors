The only downside is that the DVD version does not have the same songs as when broadcast on LOGO.  Diana Ross' terrific song in episode 9, for example, has been replaced with the Noah's Arc theme song.  What a shame.  I assume it cost too much to get the rights to the original songs for DVD, and that's why this excellent series took so long to come out on DVD - to replace all the music.  I was wondering what was taking so long.  Still, don't let this quibble stop you from enjoying the series.

1002808,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000GFLEFO,Dorrie Wheeler,"[2, 3]","It's easy to fall in love with the LOGO series Noah's Arc. The writing is witty and the characters are so well developed. It would be easy to compare Noah's Arc to a gay male version of Sex and The City. That's a pretty fair comparison as all four of the main characters are dealing with various relationship issues during the show's first season.Darryl Stephens stars in the show as Noah. He is an openly gay L.A. based aspiring screenwriting. He spends much of his time with his three best friends. Chance is a college professor who pursues co-habitation with his lover who has a small child. Alex and his longtime boyfriend Trey have been living together for a long time and appear quite happy. Alex owns a clothing store on Melrose and he can easily be considered a sex addict.The first season of the show was only 9 episodes and it's easy to watch the entire season in one sitting because the show is so high paced--and the writing is awesome. Early in the season Noah meets Wade. He thinks Wade is straight, but after some shared flirting he discovers that Wade may be interested in pursuing him on an intimate level. Very early in the season Noah and Wade take their relationship to the next level and become a couple. The only thing that is slightly unbelievable it Wade's seems rather un-conflicted. Occasionally, there is a scene where Wade is seen uncomfortable in situations but as a whole his transition from the straight world to the gay world seems pretty easy. Each of the characters have significant storylines during season one. Alex, an HIV prevention specialist goes through several major transitions with his career and his relationship with Trey. Chance gives up his apartment to move in with his lover and is suddenly face to face with infidelity. Alex, a notorious hit it and quit it playboy, falls in love with an HIV positive male nurse.Disc one and two of the three disc set include the season 1 episodes and disc 3 features bonus material.

I was afraid that there would be far too much stereotyping of the characters and the subject matter.  I'm pleased to be able to say that I WAS WRONG!

It has a story line that is most of all about the very intense friendship of the main characters.  Of course, intermingled with their friendship is love, the pursuit of love and lust, relationships, careers and religion.  All told in a very amusing way!All of the actors in this series are great.

1002812,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B000GFLEFO,James Morris,"[6, 6]","A television series about a previously ignored group of people certainly deserves attention, and I applaud the creators of Noah's Arc for daring to present the first series about the lives of African-American Gay men.  Even better, after watching both seasons on DVD, I found that Noah's Arc mostly lived up to its well-deserved accolades.  The characters are quirky, the plot lines fast and furious, the laughs frequent and genuine and the drama quite effective.I admit I was initially disappointed by the quality of the acting, until I realized that it took a few episodes for the cast to fully hit their stride, and I believe that the series perfectly fit its tag line, ""A comedy about drama"".  After I relaxed into it, I came to care about the characters and their situations quite a bit.  By the time I finished the DVD of Season One, I was so addicted to Noah and his friends that I had to purchase Season Two, even though it seemed the creators sometimes tried to squeeze just a little too much plot into a 22-minute format.  But considering the constraints they had to work with, in the end I marveled at how skillfully the writers weaved in a myriad of subjects and plotlines, subtly handling many important issues without ever being heavy handed.The lead character Noah is a case in point.  I quickly caught on that his character is deliberately rather feminine, and I realized that the writers wanted viewers to get comfortable with the idea that this slight, delicate and very femme gay man managed in eight short episodes to attract the romantic attention of a half-dozen masculine, sexy co-stars and guest stars.  The story of Noah's romance with his on-again off-again boyfriend Wade (played by the adorably dimpled hunk, Jensen Atwood) is the primary focus of the plot, although each episode also found time to explore the daily lives, loves and dramas of his three best friends, Alex, Ricky and Chance (for those who don't get it, Alex Ricky Chance = Noah's ARC, according to a comment by the series creator).But at first I wasn't sure if Noah's wardrobe and femme manner were meant to be the biggest ""in-joke"" of the series.  In an early episode, while his character is crying poverty and falls behind on his rent, he is dressed (as always) in an ever-changing ensemble of ultra-chic couture, much of which makes him look even more effeminate.  Eventually, the effeminacy issue was tackled head-on quite satisfactorily, and one character's speech about ""effemina-phobia"" and his subtle but powerful comments on the anti-eroticism / ostracism of femme men in the gay male subculture was extremely thought provoking.  This is the show's biggest strength; it manages to delve very subtly into issues that many members of the gay male community (and indeed, many gay films and novels) completely ignore, without spoiling the humor or getting too preachy.  Before long, I realized that the creators were definitely making a statement with the fact that some of Noah's outfits bordered on cross-dressing, even while I could never be sure if his clothes were meant to be taken seriously or not.  Noah's boyfriends were all extreme hunks (one thing this show does not lack for is eye candy) but all the while the disparity between Noah's feminine nature and the masculinity of his various suitors made me feel uncomfortable and definitely conscious of the looks-ism and anti-femme bigotry that permeate the gay male world today.  Bravo!In fact, the most satisfying aspect of the series was that it tackled a surprising number of real-life issues with humor and charm, and I was amazed that through the relatively short run of this show, Noah's Arc discussed a variety of important topics, like HIV testing and awareness, the ""down-low"" subculture, sero-discordant couples, gay dating, gay marriage, sexual compulsion, monogamy, gay bashing, and the previously mentioned delicate issue of ""effemina-phobia"" (and whichever writer on this show coined that word deserves a medal), all with a refreshing mix of light-hearted laugh-out-loud humor and (at times) dead serious drama.  As often as I found myself laughing hysterically, I also found myself extremely touched by the dramatic situations and challenged by the serious, provocative subject matter.There was one major disappointment - although I was aware even before I acquired the Season Two DVD set that the show had not been renewed for a third season, I was not prepared for the abrupt, unresolved cliffhanger ending of the final episode, which left the fate of one of the main characters completely up in the air.  This was quite annoying, since there was no opportunity to resolve this plot point.  For this reason alone, I must subtract one star from what would otherwise be a five star review.Despite this shortcoming, Noah's Arc gets five stars for effort, ten stars for its genuinely funny moments, and a big thank you for discussing so many important topics without being preachy or trite.  May it be a harbinger of things to come.",4,Thought Provoking and Very Funny,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,5005,"['television', 'series', 'previously', 'ignored', 'group', 'people', 'certainly',

1002817,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000GFLEFO,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[22, 24]","Noah's Arc is a fun, gay comedy from the Logo Network.  It was recommended to me by friends because of my love for Queer as Folk and Sex and the City, and it has the most hilarious elements of both but with an entirely different spin.  Logo promotes the show as Sex and the City meets Soul Food, and they're on the mark.The players:Noah - a struggling screenwriter and incurable romanticAlex - a sassy HIV educatorRicky - hot body, promiscuous, avoids monogamy like the plagueChance - uptight college professorNoah, the lead character, is played as an ultra-femme gay man with a voice that's slightly reminiscent of Michael Jackson.  He is basically the ""Carrie"" of the group with the fashion sense and money problems to prove it. His best friends form a tight-knit group with Ricky as the sex fiend ""Samantha,"" Chance as the prim and proper ""Charlotte,"" and though Alex isn't really as cynical as ""Miranda"" at least he's a professional.This show is just a bit over the top with the characters playing their roles as black gay men a little stereotypically at times, but it works.  In just the first five episodes they deal with issues like a boyfriend who needs a bit of ""thug love,"" cybersex coming between a relationship, whether or not a certain guy might be gay--and how to find out for sure.  This DVD set includes 9 episodes and special features like deleted scenes, 2 short films, auditions, extended scenes, and commentary.  I highly recommend watching the episodes with the extended scenes enabled if you haven't seen this show yet.With equal parts drama and comedy, I can't wait to see what Noah and the boys have in store for next season.",3,Sex and the City meets Soul Food meets Queer as Folk,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,1649,"['Noah', 'Arc', 'fun', 'gay', 'comedy', 'Logo', 'Network', 'was', 'recommended', 'friends', 'love', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'Sex', 'City', 'most', 'hilarious', 'elements', 'entirely', 'different', 'spin', 'Logo', 'show', 'Sex', 'City', 'meets', 'Soul', 'Food', ""'re"", 'mark.The', 'players', 'Noah', 'struggling', 'screenwriter', 'incurable', 'romanticAlex', 'sassy', 'HIV', 'educatorRicky', 'hot', 'body', 'promiscuous', 'avoids', 'monogamy', 'plagueChance', 'uptight', 'college', 'professorNoah', 'lead', 'character', 'played', 'ultra-femme', 'gay', 'man', 'voice', 'slightly', 'reminiscent', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'basically', 'Carrie', 'group', 'fashion', 'sense', 'money', 'problems', 'prove', 'best', 'friends', 'form', 'tight-knit', 'group', 'Ricky', 'sex', 'fiend', 'Samantha', 'Chance', 'prim', 'proper', 'Charlotte', 'Alex', ""n't"", 'really', 'as', 'cynical', 'Miranda', 'least', 'professional.This', 'show', 'just', 'bit', 'top', 'characters', 'playing', 'roles', 'black', 'gay', 'men', 'little', 'stereotypically', 'times', 'just', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'deal', 'issues', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'bit', 'thug', 'love', 'cybersex', 'coming', 'relationship', 'not', 'certain', 'guy', 'might', 'be', 'gay', 'how', 'find', 'out', 'sure', 'DVD', 'set', '9', 'episodes', 'special', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', '2', 'short', 'films', 'auditions', 'extended', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'episodes', 'extended', 'scenes', 'enabled', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'equal', 'parts', 'drama', 'comedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'Noah', 'boys', 'have', 'store', 'next', 'season']",Noah's Arc - The Complete First Season

But I've made myself content with following Patrik Ian Polk and promoting and supportimg his newer films. We can't harp on the old. This show brings me joy. I remember the first time I watched it, it was instant love. It makes me laugh so much and the feeling when watching it is just so good and content. It resonates deeply with home due to the genuine African American references and well the characters ARE black. And I am a true ALLY to,the LGBT community. I'm not sure how to describe this show but I know it's very unique in how it makes me feel. I had the pleasure of meeting Patrick after begging my local indie film festival to show his film. I wanted to tell him how much I appreciated his work and how much of a die hard fan I am, (very selective fan too, never felt so much to something so trivial, a tv show!) but I chickened out and settled with simply speaking to him. He's your average guy. Yet brilliant. He's doing what he likes, I think it comes easy to him to produce content, as is with most artist - they produce this stuff while in the loo-- it's just the money and making it &#34;mainstream&#34; is the difficult part.

Not just towards ""Noah's Arc"" director, Patrik-Ian Polk but also to the actors and technical crew who obviously worked very hard to put this series together and, more importantly, towards black gay programming and filmmaking in general. I can only speak for myself and as a black gay man but I know I remain hungry for representation on the big and small screen, hungry to the point where it doesn't always matter whether said representation is realistic and positive, or not. This series may only be available on a subscription only cable channel in the US and may not be available to watch on any channel in this country for a long time to come (if ever) but it's a start. No matter what I might feel about certain aspects of this series, as a whole it's definitely groundbreaking stuff. Polk is a pioneer.I winced quite a lot through the first episode or so but after that, I began to feel that the actors were really getting into a rhythm, gelling as a unit and that the storylines, though a bit short on depth, really began to show heart and humour, while at the same time managing to tackle some very important issues that as black gay men, we can often find very difficult to talk about. I particularly liked the way the HIV issue was dealt with and I have to say I don't think I've ever seen it done in a more accurate or helpful way. Not even on shows like ""ER"" or ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"", which, for obvious reasons, have raised the issue more than a few times in the past.All in all, I liked it and, mainly thanks to the way some of the storylines have been cleverly left unresolved, I genuinely look forward to the next season being released on DVD. And while I feel that characters like Perry in ""Brother To Brother"" or even Omar and his cohorts in ""The Wire"" (if you discount the criminality) are a lot closer to my reality and experience as a black gay man than any of the characters in this show, I do know we're not all the same. I do recognise that many black gay men will identify with the character in ""Noah's Arc"". Thus, I think every black gay man should have a copy, even if just for laughs.But even if you're not black or gay but would like to get a handle on one man's perspective, (albeit, I suspect, largely drawn from fantasy), on what it means to be young, black and gay in that soup-plate of superficiality otherwise known as Los Angeles in the 21st century, you should definitely check this one out.Great music by Meshell Ndegeocello though.

1002828,A9VBQBOMTCR1E,B000GFLEFO,"Sean E. Mcgrath ""kierianeleison""","[22, 37]","I understand the need for there to be more visible queer black characters in the forefront of queer media.  Even Queer as Folk which broke so much ground in terms of the gay soap opera was still mighty white.  So, while I applaud LOGO for their presentation of Noah's Arc, I have to ask, even though there is a need, does this show answer the need?I found the show to be interesting, but the plot holes and lack of structure (ironic considering the titual character is a writer) to be annoying, too annoying to appreciate the more charming moments (but only moments) the show had.Among the annoynaces were:*Who IS Trey?  Hot guy, but completely under utilized in his role.  For all it matters, Alex could be single.  And why does he have to be a nurse?  He could be a pilot or a waiter or the CEO of Sony or a parrot for all that he does each episode.  Same thing with Brandy - what a GREAT character to add to the mix.  Someone sassy and all LA Business, but she's just a vehicle for Noah to have a ""secret"" from Wade.* Why are plot points brought up and then never used again?  For example, the guy robbing Ricky's store while he's getting busy in back would make a great plot for Ricky to deal with - calling the police, having to explain where he was, having him come to some realization and grow as a character.  Nope - it was dropped.  Or Fernando, the HIV+ hustler whose only role was to serve as a vehicle for Alex quitting his job to open a new clinic.  What happened to Fernando - he's a character, a character that Alex could have used to grow as a chracter himself, not a plot device.*The pacing seems all off in the show.  For example, when Chance moves in with Eddie we get no information about how they met, what they mean to each other, how they came to the decision to move in together - yet within 5 minutes, Chance is trying to back out of the living together situation.  Why?  If we assume it's ""for the regular reasons"" well then this main character is just a shmuck - and a two-dimentional one at that; if there's a more compelling reasn, I'd like to see it acted out.  Also, what was up with Chance and his landlord?  They act like they are very close but we don't know why or if we should even care.*Why does it take less than an episode to solve problems?  No problem seems ..  well, problematic.  Nor do they really seem all that important.  Dive an SUV into a house?  No problem - it's built like a tank (not a scratch on it) and the resident doesn't want to press charges.  Closested boyfriend brings you to meet his straight friends for the first time?  No problem - order an apple martini and cut to the next scene.  Let the audience figure out what might have happened.  Closeted boyfriend jealous of your  best friend's playfulness?  No problem - ignore what he's feeling and make sure that in the next scene he puts his arms around you first.I blame two things - weak writing and the show's 30 minute running time.  If the show were an hour long, there would be much more time to develop not only the characters but conflicts and the resolutions as well.  If the writers were stronger they'd be able to navigate the characters' way through real, interesting daily life conflicts and resolutions without such abruptness.The idea behind Noah's Arc answers the need for diversity in queer entertainment and may be ""better than nothing"", but I think the community deserves ""something more"".  The rub between the need for this show and its sloppy execution of this show makes me hope that others will cry out for better quality in future seasons.",2,Needed but Needed this?,1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,3574,"['understand', 'need', 'be', 'more', 'visible', 'queer', 'black', 'characters', 'forefront', 'queer', 'media', 'Even', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'broke', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'terms', 'gay', 'soap', 'opera', 'was', 'still', 'mighty', 'white', 'So', 'applaud', 'LOGO', 'presentation', 'Noah', 'Arc', 'have', 'ask', 'even', 'need', 'show', 'need', 'found', 'show', 'be', 'interesting', 'plot', 'holes', 'lack', 'structure', 'ironic', 'considering', 'titual', 'character', 'writer', 'be', 'annoying', 'too', 'annoying', 'appreciate', 'more', 'charming', 'moments', 'only', 'moments', 'show', 'annoynaces', 'were', '*Who', 'Trey', 'Hot', 'guy', 'completely', 'utilized', 'role', 'matters', 'Alex', 'could', 'be', 'single', 'why', 'have', 'be', 'nurse', 'could', 'be', 'pilot', 'waiter', 'CEO', 'Sony', 'parrot', 'episode', 'Same', 'thing', 'Brandy', 'what', 'GREAT', 'character', 'add', 'mix', 'Someone', 'sassy', 'LA', 'Business', 'just', 'vehicle', 'Noah', 'have', 'secret', 'Wade', '*', 'Why', 'are', 'plot', 'points', 'brought', 'up', 'then', 'never', 'used', 'again', 'example', 'guy', 'robbing', 'Ricky', 'store', 'getting', 'busy', 'back', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'plot', 'Ricky', 'deal', 'calling', 'police', 'having', 'explain', 'where', 'was', 'having', 'come', 'realization', 'grow', 'character', 'Nope', 'was', 'dropped', 'Fernando', 'HIV+', 'hustler', 'only', 'role', 'was', 'serve', 'vehicle', 'Alex', 'quitting', 'job', 'open', 'new', 'clinic', 'What', 'happened', 'Fernando', 'character', 'character', 'Alex', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'grow', 'chracter', 'not', 'plot', 'device', '*The', 'pacing', 'off', 'show', 'example', 'when', 'Chance', 'Eddie', 'get', 'information', 'how', 'met', 'what', 'mean', 'other', 'how', 'came', 'decision', 'move', 'together', 'yet', '5', 'minutes', 'Chance', 'trying', 'back', 'living', 'together', 'situation', 'Why', 'assume', 'regular', 'reasons', 'well', 'then', 'main', 'character', 'just', 'shmuck', 'two-dimentional', 'one', 'more', 'compelling', 'reasn', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'acted', 'out', 'Also', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'Chance', 'landlord', 'act', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'should', 'even', 'care', '*Why', 'take', 'less', 'episode', 'solve', 'problems', 'problem', '..', 'well', 'problematic', 'do', 'really', 'seem', 'important', 'Dive', 'SUV', 'house', 'problem', 'built', 'tank', 'not', 'scratch', 'resident', ""n't"", 'want', 'press', 'charges', 'Closested', 'boyfriend', 'brings', 'meet', 'straight', 'friends', 'first', 'time', 'problem', 'order', 'apple', 'martini', 'cut', 'next', 'scene', 'Let', 'audience', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'Closeted', 'boyfriend', 'jealous', 'best', 'friend', 'playfulness', 'problem', 'ignore', 'what', 'feeling', 'make', 'sure', 'next', 'scene', 'arms', 'first.I', 'blame', 'two', 'things', 'weak', 'writing', 'show', '30', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'show', 'were', 'hour', 'long', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'develop', 'not', 'only', 'characters', 'conflicts', 'resolutions', 'well', 'writers', 'were', 'stronger', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'navigate', 'characters', 'way', 'real', 'interesting', 'daily', 'life', 'conflicts', 'resolutions', 'such', 'abruptness.The', 'idea', 'Noah', 'Arc', 'need', 'diversity', 'queer', 'entertainment', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'nothing', 'think', 'community', 'something', 'more', 'rub', 'need', 'show', 'sloppy', 'execution', 'show', 'hope', 'others', 'will', 'cry', 'out', 'better', 'quality', 'future', 'seasons']",Noah's Arc - The Complete First Season

I then went online and ordered it from LOGO. It came yesterday and I am watching episode after episode! I love it sooo much. It is soo refreshing to see poeple like 'us' on tv. There are flamboyent to straigh-acting characters which we all can relate to! I call this Sex and the City meets Queer as Folk. I do wish it was a longer season, maybe season 2 will have more episodes! The episodes all have commentaries on them, all have extended scenes showing you things they couldnt on TV, the PILOT episode and more! Order this DVD! You wont be disappointed! One drawback.... the origianl music/songs that are featured on the show are not the same on DVD. So, if you heard Rihanna's song playing at a club when you watched this on TV, it wont be on the DVD. I guess because of licensing fee's. BUT nonetheless it is a great DVD, funny, and I am glad this show came about!",5,I am ADDICTED to this show!!!!!!,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,1001,"['seeing', '2', 'episode', 'preview', 'Noah', 'Arc', 'last', 'disk', 'Final', 'Season', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'knew', 'had', 'have', 'more', 'then', 'went', 'online', 'ordered', 'LOGO', 'came', 'yesterday', 'am', 'watching', 'episode', 'episode', 'love', 'sooo', 'much', 'soo', 'refreshing', 'see', 'poeple', ""'us"", 'tv', 'are', 'flamboyent', 'straigh-acting', 'characters', 'can', 'relate', 'call', 'Sex', 'City', 'meets', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'do', 'wish', 'was', 'longer', 'season', 'maybe', 'season', '2', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'have', 'commentaries', 'have', 'extended', 'scenes', 'showing', 'things', 'couldnt', 'TV', 'PILOT', 'episode', 'more', 'Order', 'DVD', 'wont', 'be', 'disappointed', 'One', 'drawback', 'origianl', 'music/songs', 'are', 'featured', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'DVD', 'So', 'heard', 'Rihanna', 'song', 'playing', 'club', 'when', 'watched', 'TV', 'wont', 'be', 'DVD', 'guess', 'licensing', 'fee', 'BUT', 'great', 'DVD', 'funny', 'am', 'glad', 'show', 'came', 'about']",Noah's Arc - The Complete First Season
