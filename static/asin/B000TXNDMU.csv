They're always well prepared, sound great, look even better(well dressed), the band is exceptional as always. This DVD Concert is no exception. It's just a great concert. They're steepin' all over the place. And the singing, wow!!! My one disappointment is, they only did one song from their last cd, entitled ""For Your Ears Only ""  and that song was ""Butta"" . However, they put a hurt on that song.  I highly recommend this DVD. It's worth 10 stars. By the way, their latest cd,"" For Your Ears Only "" is exceptional.

The interaction with the audience was personal and very funny. Although some of the conversations were adult in nature, they were presented with good taste. The only shortcoming with this concert was the poor video quality of the production. Perhaps it was the lack of technology available at that time. It would have been great to have this on Blu-Ray.Overall, the DVD is a nice addition to your video library. This is particularly true during these days of extremely high concert ticket prices, excess traffic and parking fees. I attended their last concert in Boston three years ago and unfortunately, one of the twin brothers did not perform due to a serious illness. As these great performers begin to age, it becomes even more important to take every opportunity to purchase their DVD's and CD's to keep these memories alive!!",5,""" VINTAGE WHISPERS """,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,947,"['was', 'great', 'concert', 'truly', 'classic', 'group', 'professional', 'entertainers', 'songs', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'selected', 'interaction', 'audience', 'was', 'personal', 'very', 'funny', 'conversations', 'were', 'adult', 'nature', 'were', 'presented', 'good', 'taste', 'only', 'shortcoming', 'concert', 'was', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'production', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'lack', 'technology', 'available', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'have', 'Blu-Ray.Overall', 'DVD', 'nice', 'addition', 'video', 'library', 'particularly', 'true', 'days', 'extremely', 'high', 'concert', 'ticket', 'prices', 'excess', 'traffic', 'parking', 'fees', 'attended', 'last', 'concert', 'Boston', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'twin', 'brothers', 'did', 'not', 'perform', 'due', 'serious', 'illness', 'great', 'performers', 'begin', 'age', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'take', 'opportunity', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'CD', 'keep', 'memories', 'alive']",N/A
