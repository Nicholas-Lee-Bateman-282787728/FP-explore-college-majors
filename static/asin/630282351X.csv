339668,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,630282351X,Acute Observer,"[4, 5]","There is a torchlight parade for Frank Skeffington, a famous politician in a New England city. He is running for a fifth term as mayor. Frank is available to every man and woman in the state. Then he looks over his opponents. Next he holds court for his visitors. We see how a newspaper slants the news for their candidate. One of the columnists is Skeffington's nephew, Adam Caulfield. Politics is the greatest spectator sport in America. But its changing; the future is with radio and TV to reach the voters. [This will require huge sums of money and tilt power to the super-rich.] Skeffington explains how the feud began when Grandma worked as a maid to the Force family. Her son became Mayor and Governor, hence the bad feelings. Skeffington's son is a playboy who may never do well. The film explains why a candidate has to be careful what he does. Skeffington shows Adam the old tenement where he was born and raised. Skeffington attends a wake and tries to help a poor widow (a low priced funeral).The banks refused a loan for urban renewal and public housing (they don't want to lose their profits from slum tenements). Skeffington believes government should work for all the people. A political appointment as fire chief (non-elected?) is used to obtain the loan (it could embarrass a wealthy family). We see how TV broadcasts are rigged for the coalition candidate. But the pet dog doesn't follow the script! [This scene is hilarious!] Is an engaging rogue better than a fool for mayor? Are the educated youth avoiding politics? Skeffington explained how he settled conflicting claims for a statue in the park. It is important to not make enemies. The old mechanical voting machines are in use (they can't be fixed like computerized models). At election night the returns are tallied to the cheers of the people at campaign headquarters. But the results aren't as good as expected. The cheers give way to silence. There is a sad ending to this story.This film shows how money from big corporations can elect a novice to a top political office. [No mention of the next election.] This Hollywood version of municipal politics avoids the reality of urban renewal. The destruction of old neighborhoods had a bad effect on small businesses and relationships. Only big corporations could buy the larger plots assembled from small owners. It was a transfer of property from ordinary citizens to wealthy corporations. Small homes were destroyed and people were displaced. Jobs and shopping moved to remote malls and industrial parks resulting in the decline of cities.",4,Hollywood's Mayoral Politics,1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,2570,"['torchlight', 'parade', 'Frank', 'Skeffington', 'famous', 'politician', 'New', 'England', 'city', 'running', 'fifth', 'term', 'mayor', 'Frank', 'available', 'man', 'woman', 'state', 'Then', 'opponents', 'court', 'visitors', 'see', 'how', 'newspaper', 'news', 'candidate', 'One', 'columnists', 'Skeffington', 'nephew', 'Adam', 'Caulfield', 'Politics', 'greatest', 'spectator', 'sport', 'America', 'changing', 'future', 'radio', 'TV', 'reach', 'voters', '[', 'will', 'require', 'huge', 'sums', 'money', 'tilt', 'power', 'super-rich', ']', 'Skeffington', 'how', 'feud', 'began', 'when', 'Grandma', 'worked', 'maid', 'Force', 'family', 'son', 'became', 'Mayor', 'Governor', 'hence', 'bad', 'feelings', 'Skeffington', 'son', 'playboy', 'who', 'may', 'never', 'do', 'well', 'film', 'why', 'candidate', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'Skeffington', 'Adam', 'old', 'tenement', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'Skeffington', 'wake', 'tries', 'help', 'poor', 'widow', 'low', 'priced', 'funeral', '.The', 'banks', 'refused', 'loan', 'urban', 'renewal', 'public', 'housing', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'lose', 'profits', 'slum', 'tenements', 'Skeffington', 'government', 'should', 'work', 'people', 'political', 'appointment', 'fire', 'chief', 'non-elected', 'used', 'obtain', 'loan', 'could', 'embarrass', 'wealthy', 'family', 'see', 'how', 'TV', 'broadcasts', 'are', 'rigged', 'coalition', 'candidate', 'pet', 'dog', ""n't"", 'follow', 'script', '[', 'scene', 'hilarious', ']', 'engaging', 'rogue', 'better', 'fool', 'mayor', 'Are', 'educated', 'youth', 'avoiding', 'politics', 'Skeffington', 'explained', 'how', 'settled', 'conflicting', 'claims', 'statue', 'park', 'important', 'not', 'make', 'enemies', 'old', 'mechanical', 'voting', 'machines', 'are', 'use', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fixed', 'computerized', 'models', 'election', 'night', 'returns', 'are', 'tallied', 'cheers', 'people', 'campaign', 'headquarters', 'results', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'expected', 'cheers', 'give', 'way', 'silence', 'sad', 'ending', 'story.This', 'film', 'how', 'money', 'big', 'corporations', 'can', 'elect', 'novice', 'top', 'political', 'office', 'mention', 'next', 'election', ']', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'municipal', 'politics', 'avoids', 'reality', 'urban', 'renewal', 'destruction', 'old', 'neighborhoods', 'had', 'bad', 'effect', 'small', 'businesses', 'relationships', 'Only', 'big', 'corporations', 'could', 'buy', 'larger', 'plots', 'assembled', 'small', 'owners', 'was', 'transfer', 'property', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'wealthy', 'corporations', 'Small', 'homes', 'were', 'destroyed', 'people', 'were', 'displaced', 'Jobs', 'shopping', 'moved', 'remote', 'malls', 'industrial', 'parks', 'resulting', 'decline', 'cities']",N/A

What's most odd about this film is that John Ford directed it, and yet it's so dull and disjointed.  And what, exactly, are they trying to say here?

It's never quite clear what we're supposed to feel about Skeffington; clearly his enemies are horrible, shallow people, but the film is so fuzzy about how we're supposed to feel in constrast about Tracy's character -- who was roughly modeled on one of Boston's old mayor's -- that it's difficult to feel moved, or involved, one way or the other.

While the story of an old time politician losing to a ""manufactured"" politician who plays well on TV is a great story and still very timely, the film seems tired, as if Ford and Tracy are just going through the motions to get it over with.  The film is beautifully shot in black and white, there are some very good performances (Jeffrey Hunter is very good as a reporter and Willis Bouchey as a sworn enemy of Tracy's), but overall, the film feels lethargic and feels very, very long.  There seems to be a pall over the proceedings.  This may be intentional, as Tracy's character suffers a stroke after losing the election and passes on, but I think it may just be that Ford was getting tired of filmmaking and not really inspired to do great work.  The film also feels long, which is very unlike Ford.  Ford's best films shoot along at a beautiful pace, but here, his pacing and editing is a let down.Up until The Searchers, Ford's work was exemplary.  There was hardly a dud in any of his films.  But after The Searchers, his work became erratic, hovering between brilliance (Liberty Valance and Donovan's Reef), decent work (Sergeant Rutledge, 7 Women), and really bad, tired films (The Horse Soldiers, Two Rode Together, and Wings of Eagles).  It was the only time in his career where the bad outweighed the good.  The Last Hurrah has some great moments, but overall it's a rather tired exercise, which is a shame, as there was a lot more potential there.",3,"One of Ford's lesser works, indictative of the unevenness of his late period....spoilers....",1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,1570,"['one', 'Ford', 'lesser', 'works', 'indictative', 'later', 'work', 'was', 'erratic', 'say', 'least', 'story', 'old', 'time', 'politician', 'losing', 'manufactured', 'politician', 'who', 'well', 'TV', 'great', 'story', 'still', 'very', 'timely', 'film', 'tired', 'Ford', 'Tracy', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'get', 'over', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'very', 'good', 'reporter', 'Willis', 'Bouchey', 'sworn', 'enemy', 'Tracy', 'overall', 'film', 'feels', 'lethargic', 'feels', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'be', 'pall', 'proceedings', 'may', 'be', 'intentional', 'Tracy', 'character', 'stroke', 'losing', 'election', 'passes', 'think', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'Ford', 'was', 'getting', 'tired', 'filmmaking', 'not', 'really', 'inspired', 'do', 'great', 'work', 'film', 'also', 'long', 'very', 'Ford', 'Ford', 'best', 'films', 'shoot', 'along', 'beautiful', 'pace', 'here', 'pacing', 'editing', 'let', 'down.Up', 'Searchers', 'Ford', 'work', 'was', 'exemplary', 'was', 'hardly', 'dud', 'films', 'Searchers', 'work', 'became', 'erratic', 'hovering', 'brilliance', 'Liberty', 'Valance', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'decent', 'work', 'Sergeant', 'Rutledge', '7', 'Women', 'really', 'bad', 'tired', 'films', 'Horse', 'Soldiers', 'Two', 'Rode', 'Together', 'Wings', 'Eagles', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'career', 'where', 'bad', 'outweighed', 'good', 'Last', 'Hurrah', 'great', 'moments', 'overall', 'rather', 'tired', 'exercise', 'shame', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'potential', 'there']",N/A

Vuksic ""Jim V.""","[2, 2]","""The Last Hurrah"" is a classic comedy/drama starring Spencer Tracy who portrays aging, Irish-American professional politician, Mayor Frank Skeffington, as he runs what is likely to be his final campaign.The story takes place in the late 1950's when the idea of utilizing television to promote a political candidate was still a novelty.Skeffington's personal campaign style (late-night neighborhood parades, impromptu speeches on street corners, visits to funeral wakes held in private homes, one-on-one audiences with potential voters, etc.) will resurrect fond memories of a by-gone era in older viewers like myself and introduce younger viewers to an age when radio was still the most popular home entertainment appliance and personal computers did not exist.Tracy's portrayal of Mayor Skeffington is a pure delight.  Even when he is blatently violating the law to achieve his goal, he does it in such a charming manner that the viewer cannot help but smile and cheer him on.This dramatic comedy was first released in 1958, but is as relevent today as it was then.

It's always been my contention that had Ford been the director of the Tracy-Hepburn film &#34;The Sea of Grass&#34; it would have  been one of their finest films instead of the little regarded film that director Elia Kazan totally botched because he had no feeling for presenting the West on screen or the people who populated it.But finally Tracy and Ford did make this film -- the story of a powerful Irish politician who has the gift of the silver tongue and also the gift of knowing how to &#34;operate&#34; -- how to get votes, how to manipulate his opponents, etc.  This is the story of the &#34;last hurrah&#34; the last campaign of a man who is now older and faced with the &#34;new age&#34; of winning elections -- one that no longer relies on the personal touch, the ward bosses, the street money etc but on media and slick campaigns.  Tracy is quite wonderful as the politician -- he's light when he needs to be, he charms, he cajoles, and he is the tough, no-nonsense guy when he needs to be.  I do think that Tracy and Ford being Irishmen gave them a special insight into how to present an old time Irish pol -- I'm not saying that it didn't require Tracy to act -- but it helps that he has the right demeanor and hits the right notes not just in the man's character but in the way he speaks and the way he has the &#34;twinkle&#34; in his eye that conveys the charm of this man as he is seeing the end of his career and his life approach.",5,Tracy and Ford -- a winning combination,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,1888,"['admit', 'am', 'political', 'junkie', 'so', 'watching', 'film', 'definitely', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Early', 'careers', 'Tracy', 'Ford', 'were', 'friends', 'fact', 'was', 'Ford', 'who', 'saw', 'Tracy', 'play', 'suggested', 'be', 'tested', 'films', 'time', 'friendship', 'waned', ""n't"", 'room', 'here', 'say', 'why', 'suffice', 'say', 'loss', 'two', 'giants', 'film', 'passed', 'many', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'films', 'together', 'always', 'been', 'contention', 'had', 'Ford', 'been', 'director', 'Tracy-Hepburn', 'film', '34', 'Sea', 'Grass', '34', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'instead', 'little', 'regarded', 'film', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'totally', 'botched', 'had', 'feeling', 'presenting', 'West', 'screen', 'people', 'who', 'populated', 'it.But', 'finally', 'Tracy', 'Ford', 'did', 'make', 'film', 'story', 'powerful', 'Irish', 'politician', 'who', 'gift', 'silver', 'tongue', 'also', 'gift', 'knowing', 'how', '34', 'operate', '34', 'how', 'get', 'votes', 'how', 'manipulate', 'opponents', 'etc', 'story', '34', 'last', 'hurrah', '34', 'last', 'campaign', 'man', 'who', 'now', 'older', 'faced', '34', 'new', 'age', '34', 'winning', 'elections', 'one', 'no', 'longer', 'relies', 'personal', 'touch', 'ward', 'bosses', 'street', 'money', 'etc', 'media', 'slick', 'campaigns', 'Tracy', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'politician', 'light', 'when', 'be', 'tough', 'no-nonsense', 'guy', 'when', 'be', 'do', 'think', 'Tracy', 'Ford', 'being', 'Irishmen', 'gave', 'special', 'insight', 'how', 'present', 'old', 'time', 'Irish', 'pol', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'Tracy', 'act', 'right', 'demeanor', 'right', 'notes', 'not', 'just', 'man', 'character', 'way', 'way', '34', 'twinkle', '34', 'eye', 'charm', 'man', 'seeing', 'end', 'career', 'life', 'approach']",N/A

Unfortunately, Donald Crisp as the Cardinal and Basil Rathbone don't have that much on-screen time, and Rathbone really only has one big scene and a couple of other pieces of dialogue here and there, as does Crisp, but they're still excellent in their roles.A few scenes seem a little weak, such as when Tracy tricks Basil Rathbone's idiot son to accept the Fire Marshall job so he can blackmail Rathbone into ponying up the housing loan money. The TV interview with Tracy's young opponent was pretty silly, and I didn't think John Carradine was especially well cast as a former KKK member, magazine publisher, and Tracy's long-time nemesis.Other than that, the film's portrayal of Tracy as a tough, smart, down-to-earth, old-time political boss (or as Donald Crisp refers to him--""an engaging scoundrel"") is itself engagingly and humorously done. It provides a fascinating and perhaps nostalgic look at a vanished era of grass-roots politicians back when they stumped in the inner-city wards, shaking hands and kissing babies and vying for votes one-by-one the hard way before the advent of TV changed the political campaigning process forever.Overall, still a great flick and especially worth seeing if you're a Spencer Tracy fan.",5,Still great despite a few weak points,1024099200,"06 15, 2002",2002,1649,"['Political', 'dramas', 'are', 'not', 'favorite', 'type', 'movie', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'other', 'reason', ""'m"", 'big', 'Tracy', 'fan', 'certainly', 'one', 'greatest', 'roles', 'Tracy', 'one', 'best', 'performances.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'Tracy', 'newspaperman', 'nephew', 'Edward', 'Brophy', 'one', 'Tracy', 'cronies', 'whom', 'get', 'extensive', 'play', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'Cardinal', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'on-screen', 'time', 'Rathbone', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'big', 'scene', 'couple', 'other', 'pieces', 'dialogue', 'here', 'there', 'Crisp', ""'re"", 'still', 'excellent', 'roles.A', 'few', 'scenes', 'seem', 'little', 'weak', 'such', 'when', 'Tracy', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'idiot', 'son', 'accept', 'Fire', 'Marshall', 'job', 'can', 'blackmail', 'Rathbone', 'ponying', 'up', 'housing', 'loan', 'money', 'TV', 'interview', 'Tracy', 'young', 'opponent', 'was', 'pretty', 'silly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'John', 'Carradine', 'was', 'especially', 'well', 'cast', 'former', 'KKK', 'member', 'magazine', 'publisher', 'Tracy', 'long-time', 'nemesis.Other', 'film', 'portrayal', 'Tracy', 'tough', 'smart', 'down-to-earth', 'old-time', 'political', 'boss', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'refers', 'engaging', 'scoundrel', 'engagingly', 'humorously', 'done', 'fascinating', 'perhaps', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'vanished', 'era', 'grass-roots', 'politicians', 'back', 'when', 'stumped', 'inner-city', 'wards', 'shaking', 'hands', 'kissing', 'babies', 'vying', 'votes', 'one-by-one', 'hard', 'way', 'advent', 'TV', 'changed', 'political', 'campaigning', 'process', 'forever.Overall', 'still', 'great', 'flick', 'especially', 'worth', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'fan']",N/A

He?s running for a third term but meets with great opposition from the city council, who don't appreciate his strong-arm tactics and chronic meddling in their affairs. The pack of detractors is led by Norman Cass Sr. (Basil Rathbone), whose youthful incumbent for the post of mayor, Kevin McCluskey (Charles B. Fitzsimmons) seems an impossible long shot. But Skeffington is not above dishing a little dirt of his own on the side. He uses incriminating photos of Cass?s simpleton son, Norman Jr. (O.Z. Whitehead) to blackmail Cass Sr. into relative submission. Skeffington also gingerly berates the elements of city council opposing him, including news paper editor, Amos Force (John Carradine) to whom Skeffington?s nephew, Adam Caufield (Jeffrey Hunter) is an employee and sometimes unwilling observer. As Skeffington, Tracy is pure dynamite, delving out equal portions of brutality and kindness in a tour de force performance that quite easily might be his best! There are plenty of finely wrought cameos to go around, including Jane Darwell?s crotchety spinster, Anna Lee?s subtle and tender performance as the widow and Donald Crisp?s stoic turn as His Eminence, Cardinal Burke. This is one heck of a good show!Instituted into the pipeline before Columbia's penny-pinching regime kicked in, &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; has had admirable work done on its transfer before being minted to DVD.

Ford distances himself from death in How Green was My Valley by making it part of a flashback.  Tom Doniphon's death in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance takes place between the present story and the flashback.  People praise Ford for his ambiguity.
