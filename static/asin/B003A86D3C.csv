1334713,A2IS16K96YSFDV,B003A86D3C,Eric Mayforth,"[4, 4]","This DVD set covers the third season (2009) of the Discovery Channel's ""Storm Chasers"" series.  Meteorologist Reed Timmer and filmmaker Sean Casey return along with new cast member Tim Samaras to try to get scientific data from tornadoes by chasing the storms across Oklahoma, Kansas, and other locations in Tornado Alley.  There are the inevitable clashes and conflicts over chasing methods, and while the teams do have their rough, unsuccessful days, some of them also had great successes in the '09 season.  If you enjoyed the first two seasons of this series, you will enjoy this one as well.In addition to all eight episodes of the ""Storm Chasers"" season, the DVD set contains bonus material--deleted ""Storm Chasers"" scenes and a preview episode of ""Against The Elements"", which shows tornado footage from South Dakota and a flood situation in the Pacific Northwest.",5,More Great Storm Chasing,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,871,"['DVD', 'set', 'third', 'season', '2009', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'Storm', 'Chasers', 'series', 'Meteorologist', 'Reed', 'Timmer', 'filmmaker', 'Sean', 'Casey', 'return', 'new', 'cast', 'member', 'Tim', 'Samaras', 'try', 'get', 'scientific', 'data', 'tornadoes', 'chasing', 'storms', 'Oklahoma', 'Kansas', 'other', 'locations', 'Tornado', 'Alley', 'are', 'inevitable', 'clashes', 'conflicts', 'chasing', 'methods', 'teams', 'do', 'have', 'rough', 'unsuccessful', 'days', 'also', 'had', 'great', 'successes', ""'09"", 'season', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'series', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'well.In', 'addition', 'eight', 'episodes', 'Storm', 'Chasers', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'contains', 'bonus', 'material', 'deleted', 'Storm', 'Chasers', 'scenes', 'preview', 'episode', 'Against', 'Elements', 'tornado', 'footage', 'South', 'Dakota', 'flood', 'situation', 'Pacific', 'Northwest']",Storm Chasers: Season 3

It is filmed and narrated to perfection and is accompanied by incredible footage of incredible and powerful storms. This season follows 3 chasers and their teams: Sean Casey who built the TIV(Tornado Intercept Vehicle) with the intent of getting inside of a tornado and recording the footage with an IMAX camera to complete his film, Reed Timmer who in this Season customizes his vehicle in a similar way to Seans allowing him to get closer than ever to tornados and Tim Samaras whose team records data and some amazing footage as well. In this season there is some tension between Reed and Sean mostly because Sean doesn't like that Reed somewhat copied his armored vehicle idea and because Reed tends to have better luck than Sean and his team. Dr. Josh Wurman's Vortex team also appears in this season and guides Sean and his team to tornados with their Radar Truck. Not to spoil the season but Sean finally gets the shot he needs as the TIV gets inside of a Tornado in Wyoming. Overall this is a great show and this is probably the best season of Storm Chasers.",5,One of Discovery's best!,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,1109,"['be', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'filmed', 'narrated', 'perfection', 'accompanied', 'incredible', 'footage', 'incredible', 'powerful', 'storms', 'season', '3', 'chasers', 'teams', 'Sean', 'Casey', 'who', 'built', 'TIV', 'Tornado', 'Intercept', 'Vehicle', 'intent', 'getting', 'tornado', 'recording', 'footage', 'IMAX', 'camera', 'complete', 'film', 'Reed', 'Timmer', 'who', 'Season', 'vehicle', 'similar', 'way', 'Seans', 'allowing', 'get', 'closer', 'ever', 'tornados', 'Tim', 'Samaras', 'team', 'records', 'data', 'amazing', 'footage', 'as', 'well', 'season', 'tension', 'Reed', 'Sean', 'mostly', 'Sean', ""n't"", 'like', 'Reed', 'somewhat', 'copied', 'armored', 'vehicle', 'idea', 'Reed', 'have', 'better', 'luck', 'Sean', 'team', 'Dr.', 'Josh', 'Wurman', 'Vortex', 'team', 'also', 'season', 'guides', 'Sean', 'team', 'tornados', 'Radar', 'Truck', 'Not', 'spoil', 'season', 'Sean', 'finally', 'shot', 'TIV', 'inside', 'Tornado', 'Wyoming', 'Overall', 'great', 'show', 'probably', 'best', 'season', 'Storm', 'Chasers']",Storm Chasers: Season 3

Of course, there is quite a bit of tornado video clips and plenty of action. The super professionals on the prior seasons 1 & 2 were not on the third season however and that sort of disapointed me somewhat, but overall, it's still a good DVD and if you're a storm or tornado chaser and like to see chasers get pretty close to tornadoes, then I would get this video.
