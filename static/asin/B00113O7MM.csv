1129425,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B00113O7MM,Amanda Richards,"[26, 31]","""I Told The Witch Doctor You Didn't Love Me TrueI Told The Witch Doctor You Didn't Love Me Nice""(""Witch Doctor"")Three CGI chipmunks carry this movie on their narrow little shoulders, and that's a very good thing, seeing that the plot is nothing special and neither are the performances of the human actors.Unceremoniously expelled from their tree home, the chipmunks are having a very bad day, until they show their stuff to Dave (Jason Lee), a songwriter who's told to quit his day job.What happens next is basically what you'd expect when you let three forest critters occupy your living space, as well as the inevitable series of misunderstandings that occur in mixed species family groups.David Cross plays Ian Hawke, the hammy heavy. He's a music producer who sees dollar signs with each helium-inspired note, and has great plans for the talented trio which may or may not include dopey Dave.The music will send adults down memory lane, with new Chipmunky versions of ""Witch Doctor"", ""Funkytown"", ""Only You"", and ""The Chipmunk Song"", and younger viewers will recognize Daniel Powter's ""Bad Day"".  There are also some new funky songs and stylin' choreography.Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. CGI chipmunks sing and dance2. Rest of movie is the same old song and danceFor children - rated 4 starsFor adults - rated 3 stars (one for each chipmunk)Recommended as a stocking stuffer for children of all ages, and fans of the TV series.""We can hardly stand the waitPlease Christmas, don't be late.""(The Chipmunk Song)Amanda Richards, July 26, 2008",4,"Ooo eee, ooo ah ah ting tang, Walla walla, bing bang",1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1552,"['Told', 'Witch', 'Doctor', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Love', 'Me', 'TrueI', 'Told', 'Witch', 'Doctor', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Love', 'Me', 'Nice', 'Witch', 'Doctor', 'Three', 'CGI', 'chipmunks', 'carry', 'movie', 'narrow', 'little', 'shoulders', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'seeing', 'plot', 'nothing', 'special', 'are', 'performances', 'human', 'actors.Unceremoniously', 'expelled', 'tree', 'home', 'chipmunks', 'are', 'having', 'very', 'bad', 'day', 'show', 'stuff', 'Dave', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'songwriter', 'who', 'told', 'quit', 'day', 'job.What', 'next', 'basically', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'when', 'let', 'three', 'forest', 'critters', 'occupy', 'living', 'space', 'as', 'well', 'inevitable', 'series', 'misunderstandings', 'occur', 'mixed', 'species', 'family', 'groups.David', 'Cross', 'plays', 'Ian', 'Hawke', 'hammy', 'heavy', 'music', 'producer', 'who', 'dollar', 'signs', 'helium-inspired', 'note', 'great', 'plans', 'talented', 'trio', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'include', 'dopey', 'Dave.The', 'music', 'will', 'send', 'adults', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'new', 'Chipmunky', 'versions', 'Witch', 'Doctor', 'Funkytown', 'Only', 'Chipmunk', 'Song', 'younger', 'viewers', 'will', 'recognize', 'Daniel', 'Powter', 'Bad', 'Day', 'are', 'also', 'new', 'funky', 'songs', 'stylin', 'choreography.Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'SASS', ':1', 'CGI', 'sing', 'dance2', 'Rest', 'movie', 'same', 'old', 'song', 'danceFor', 'children', 'rated', '4', 'starsFor', 'adults', 'rated', '3', 'stars', 'one', 'chipmunk', 'Recommended', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'children', 'ages', 'fans', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'hardly', 'stand', 'waitPlease', 'Christmas', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'late', 'Chipmunk', 'Song', 'Amanda', 'Richards', 'July', '26', '2008']",Alvin and the Chipmunks [Theatrical Release]

1129429,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00113O7MM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I was very, very against seeing this movie.  As a huge fan of `The Chipmunks' in my youth I was certain; positive even, that this movie was going to destroy them.  I found though, after being forced by family to watch this movie, that instead of `destroying' them they actually brought them to a wider audience.  In fact, `Alvin and the Chipmunks' was fun, fresh, spunky and pretty much everything I remember about those cute fuzzy little rodents in the first place.  I was pleasantly surprised with how well thought out this movie actually was.The story follows Dave Seville, a down and out songwriter who is just trying to catch a break.  That break comes in a much unexpected place.  Dave meets three cute little chipmunks who just so happen to be able to talk.  Not only can they talk but they can sing.  Striking a deal that if they sing his songs he'll let them live with him, Dave and the Chipmunks form a musical team.  That team is threatened though when a greedy music executive Ian Hawke attempts to drive a wedge between Dave and the boys for his own selfish gain.The very concept of `Alvin and the Chipmunks' has been modernized to appeal to today's youth but it never loses the charm and appeal that it's always had.  That's what I respect so much about this adaptation.  I was so certain they were going to ruin what remains such a wonderful childhood memory of mine, but I'm so happy to say that that couldn't be further from the truth.  In fact, thanks to `Alvin and the Chipmunks' I now have a nice way of passing along this wonderful and wholesome children's story onto my own children.The acting is decent, although the CGI-Chipmunks do steal the whole show.  Jason Lee has never really had a good track record with film; he's more suited for television (as `My Name is Earl' has proven) but he manages to deal well with this performance.  David Cross plays the same character no matter what film he's in, and he does a decent job at it so who am I to knock it.  Cameron Richardson doesn't have to do much but be pretty, and she is.  Jane Lynch is fantastic in her very short cameo performance.  She is always hilarious and she captures everything I love so much about her without really having much to do.  Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney play Alvin, Simon and Theodore, although you never no it with all the voice distorting going on.  I can't really say anything for their voice-over work because quite frankly it's not really them performing is it?`Alvin and the Chipmunks' also manages to teach the viewer some important lessons about the reality of family.  It proves that a family is so much more than a mother, father, sons and daughters but can really come in any shape or size.  A family is a group of people (or animals in this case) who love and care for one another and who look out for one another and have each others best interests at heart.I think it's obvious where I stand with this one.  I was floored with my final reaction to the film.  I'll most definitely see it again, most likely I'll own it, for it's such a fun and entertaining film that I'm sure my daughter will grow to love it, and it's something the whole family can enjoy wholeheartedly as apposed to merely tolerate begrudgingly.",4,A pleasant adaptation of a childhood classic...,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,3254,"['was', 'very', 'very', 'seeing', 'movie', 'huge', 'fan', 'Chipmunks', 'youth', 'was', 'certain', 'positive', 'even', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'destroy', 'found', 'being', 'forced', 'family', 'watch', 'movie', 'instead', 'destroying', 'actually', 'brought', 'wider', 'audience', 'fact', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'was', 'fun', 'fresh', 'spunky', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'remember', 'cute', 'fuzzy', 'little', 'rodents', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'movie', 'actually', 'was.The', 'story', 'Dave', 'Seville', 'down', 'songwriter', 'who', 'just', 'trying', 'catch', 'break', 'break', 'much', 'unexpected', 'place', 'Dave', 'meets', 'three', 'cute', 'little', 'chipmunks', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'happen', 'be', 'able', 'talk', 'Not', 'only', 'can', 'talk', 'can', 'sing', 'Striking', 'deal', 'sing', 'songs', ""'ll"", 'let', 'live', 'Dave', 'Chipmunks', 'form', 'musical', 'team', 'team', 'threatened', 'when', 'greedy', 'music', 'executive', 'Ian', 'Hawke', 'attempts', 'drive', 'wedge', 'Dave', 'boys', 'own', 'selfish', 'gain.The', 'very', 'concept', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'been', 'modernized', 'appeal', 'today', 'youth', 'never', 'charm', 'appeal', 'always', 'had', 'what', 'respect', 'so', 'much', 'adaptation', 'was', 'so', 'certain', 'were', 'going', 'ruin', 'what', 'such', 'wonderful', 'childhood', 'memory', 'mine', ""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'say', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'fact', 'thanks', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'now', 'have', 'nice', 'way', 'passing', 'wonderful', 'wholesome', 'children', 'story', 'own', 'children.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'CGI-Chipmunks', 'do', 'steal', 'whole', 'show', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'good', 'track', 'record', 'film', 'more', 'suited', 'television', 'Name', 'Earl', 'proven', 'deal', 'well', 'performance', 'David', 'Cross', 'same', 'character', 'matter', 'what', 'film', 'decent', 'job', 'so', 'who', 'am', 'knock', 'Cameron', 'Richardson', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'much', 'be', 'pretty', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'fantastic', 'very', 'short', 'cameo', 'performance', 'always', 'hilarious', 'everything', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'having', 'much', 'do', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'Jesse', 'McCartney', 'play', 'Alvin', 'Simon', 'Theodore', 'never', 'voice', 'distorting', 'going', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'anything', 'voice-over', 'work', 'quite', 'not', 'really', 'performing', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'also', 'teach', 'viewer', 'important', 'lessons', 'reality', 'family', 'family', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'mother', 'father', 'sons', 'daughters', 'can', 'really', 'come', 'shape', 'size', 'family', 'group', 'people', 'animals', 'case', 'who', 'love', 'care', 'one', 'who', 'look', 'out', 'one', 'have', 'others', 'best', 'interests', 'heart.I', 'think', 'obvious', 'where', 'stand', 'one', 'was', 'floored', 'final', 'reaction', 'film', ""'ll"", 'most', 'definitely', 'see', 'again', 'most', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'own', 'such', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'daughter', 'will', 'grow', 'love', 'something', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'wholeheartedly', 'apposed', 'merely', 'tolerate', 'begrudgingly']",Alvin and the Chipmunks [Theatrical Release]

1129436,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00113O7MM,blackaciddevil,"[2, 2]","I first saw mention of this movie when I went to the theater last summer to see ""Hairspray"". I was ecstatic to hear that it'd be showing around Christmastime. In the 80's, I was a hardcore Alvin & The Chipmunks fan, I admit. I watched the cartoon show religiously every Saturday Morning. Sadly, Christmastime rolled around but I never was able to go see it. Not that I didn't want to, I did. Time wouldn't allow me to. Now, it's out on DVD and I finally made time to purchase and see this movie. I'm really glad I did. It's an endearing movie about a songwriter named Dave Seville who meets the 'munks when they're raiding his kitchen for food. Quickly, he boots them out. Yet, when he finds out that they can carry a tune, he quickly welcomes them back in & totes them off to a record executive who soon takes them away from Dave & exploits their talent for all it is worth. Dave spends the rest of the movie trying to save the boys from a showbusiness life they are too young for. Like everyone else, I would have loved the movie alot better if it would have shown alot more of the chipmunks...you know, like the cartoon does. It's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, though. Course, Garfield's first movie didn't show him all that much either and it was just as awesome. When they make a 'munks sequel(and I'm sure they will), we'll probably see more of them.

1129438,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00113O7MM,Caleb Williams,"[0, 0]","Alvin & The Chipmunks is one of those shows that you remember with fondness from your childhood and thanks to corporate money grabbing, the movie executives decided it was a good idea to take your childhood and update it. I was skeptical at first, I thought this would just be another one of those movies that takes a classic cartoon series like Garfield or The Flintstones and makes a feature length movie using either Live action, CGI or both. Because of this I kept away from this film as long as I could but after resisting temptation for so long, I had to give in and at least give it a try, needless to say I wasn't disappointed. For this review I will discuss both the pros and cons of this movie to give you a fair and honest view of the film to give you an informed decision.Pro: Jason Lee: Most people will know him from the hit comedy series My Name Is Earl and with these people that will have been the only reason they will have given this film a chance. He's a great comic actor and someone that you just look at and smile because of his natural charisma and ease at which he plays the beaten, yet optimistic Dave Seville. He is a bit cringeworthy when doing the whole ALVIN!!!! thing as, although it's a part of the classic series, in todays setting it just doesn't fit. Either way though Jason Lee was one of the primary reasons why I enjoyed the film like I didCon: The CGI: I know if you wanted to make a live action version of Alvin and the Chipmunks the use of CGI would be inevitable. The problem I have with it though, is that the CGI animations are quite sub-par and by todays standards should have been much better. At times with the CGI being a bit unrealistic it took a big element out of the film and in a way destroyed the fantasy element of the whole thing.Pro: The Music: Obviously the whole premise of Alvin and the Chipmunks being that they're singing Chipmunks, the introduction of music would be inevitable. From the get go we're introduced to the classic high pitched yet melodic singing of the gang and the voices just make you think that the whole thing is adorable. Being voiced by Justin Long, Jesse McCartney & Matthew Gray Gubler the singing is an even bigger surprise as it does present a feel of genuine harmony between the three.Great movie that I personally think everybody should have a watch of.",5,An Adorable Movie,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,2342,"['Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'one', 'shows', 'remember', 'fondness', 'childhood', 'thanks', 'corporate', 'money', 'grabbing', 'movie', 'executives', 'decided', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'take', 'childhood', 'update', 'was', 'skeptical', 'first', 'thought', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'movies', 'classic', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Garfield', 'Flintstones', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'using', 'Live', 'action', 'CGI', 'kept', 'away', 'film', 'as', 'long', 'could', 'resisting', 'temptation', 'so', 'long', 'had', 'give', 'least', 'give', 'try', 'needless', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'review', 'will', 'discuss', 'pros', 'cons', 'movie', 'give', 'fair', 'honest', 'view', 'film', 'give', 'informed', 'decision.Pro', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Most', 'people', 'will', 'know', 'hit', 'comedy', 'series', 'My', 'Name', 'Is', 'Earl', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'reason', 'will', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'chance', 'great', 'comic', 'actor', 'someone', 'just', 'look', 'smile', 'natural', 'charisma', 'ease', 'beaten', 'yet', 'optimistic', 'Dave', 'Seville', 'bit', 'cringeworthy', 'when', 'doing', 'whole', 'ALVIN', 'thing', 'part', 'classic', 'series', 'todays', 'setting', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'way', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'was', 'one', 'primary', 'reasons', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'didCon', 'CGI', 'know', 'wanted', 'make', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'use', 'CGI', 'would', 'be', 'inevitable', 'problem', 'have', 'CGI', 'animations', 'are', 'quite', 'sub-par', 'todays', 'standards', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'times', 'CGI', 'being', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'took', 'big', 'element', 'film', 'way', 'destroyed', 'fantasy', 'element', 'whole', 'thing.Pro', 'Music', 'Obviously', 'whole', 'premise', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'being', ""'re"", 'singing', 'Chipmunks', 'introduction', 'music', 'would', 'be', 'inevitable', 'get', 'go', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'classic', 'high', 'pitched', 'yet', 'melodic', 'singing', 'gang', 'voices', 'just', 'make', 'think', 'whole', 'thing', 'adorable', 'Being', 'voiced', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Jesse', 'McCartney', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'singing', 'even', 'bigger', 'surprise', 'present', 'feel', 'genuine', 'harmony', 'three.Great', 'movie', 'personally', 'think', 'everybody', 'should', 'have', 'watch']",Alvin and the Chipmunks [Theatrical Release]

1129444,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00113O7MM,Chris Pandolfi,"[12, 23]","""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is a cute film, but it's also the cinematic equivalent of empty calories--light, airy, and sweet, with nothing of value except for maybe a few moments of enjoyment. After it's over, the experience is forgotten, and we're no better or worse than before we saw it. There really isn't much that can be analyzed, deconstructed, or even explained; this is one of those films that puts absolutely everything on the table, able to capture the attention of even the most inattentive five-year-old. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, but I'd be lying if I said that I'm the right person to have seen it. This is for kids and kids alone, a bright, energetic, simple film unfettered of complexity and meaning.Now that I've gotten all my adult-level jargon out of the way, let me summarize the plot for you. Dave Seville (Jason Lee) is a struggling songwriter, unable to impress anyone with his music, least of all Ian (David Cross), the executive of a record company. When he steals a basket of muffins out of spite, he discovers three small, furry, squeaky-voiced chipmunk stowaways: the troublemaking Alvin (voiced by Justin Long), the brainy Simon (voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler), and the meek overeater Theodore (voiced by Jesse McCartney). Dave soon discovers that the three are natural born singers, and thus negotiates an arrangement: they can stay in his home so long as they sing the songs he writes. The film begins at Christmastime, so naturally, Dave's first song with the chipmunks is ""The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)."" You know--the one where Alvin wants a Hula Hoop.This song soon brings Ian back into the game, and he immediately shows his true colors by tempting them away from Dave. He lavishes them with expensive gifts. He tells lies about how Dave feels about them. But most importantly, he turns them into full-blown music superstars, allowing them to live a carefree lifestyle of food, toys, and video games. These things sound juvenile, but as Simon explains, he, Alvin, and Theodore are only kids; their parents left them a week after their birth, which is supposedly the way it's done with chipmunks. Of course, if you actually care one way or another about where they came from, how old they are, or even why they're able to talk and sing, then this is definitely not the movie for you.But I digress. As the chipmunks are lured deeper and deeper into the crazy world of pop music celebrity, Dave realizes that he misses them, despite the fact that they drove him crazy. They in turn feel the strain of constant performing, and even though they believe that Dave doesn't want them back, they still would like to go home. Ian, of course, finds this unacceptable; he sees the chipmunks as nothing but cute moneymakers, an excuse to manufacture and distribute a boatload of rodent-related merchandise. He repeatedly says that he never loses, and isn't that exactly what you'd expect the villain of a kid's movie to say? Anyway, in realizing that the chipmunks are about to launch a twelve-month world tour, Dave vows to save them, not only from Ian, but from fame, as well. Helping him is a press photographer named Claire (Cameron Richardson), and as you might have guessed, she and Dave have feelings for each other.That's about as much of the plot as there is to summarize. If this doesn't fit the bill as pure child-friendly escapism, then I must have missed something along the way. Short of the direct to video Barbie films, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is about as fluffy and generally unimportant as they get. It's filled to the brim with sight gags, such as the chipmunks trashing Dave's house, ridiculous character quirks, and a scene in which Simon puts Theodore's accident into his mouth, convincing Dave that a raisin had somehow landed on the couch. There's also moment when Alvin inhales helium from a balloon; apparently, helium makes an already high-pitched voice sound deeper. Pretty much the only things saving this film from being too sickly sweet are the numerous pop culture references--songs such as ""Funkytown,"" ""Don't Cha,"" and ""Only You"" find their way into the film, as do a number of present day slang terms like, ""My bad."" Even chipmunks have to keep up with the times.Or do they? This film adaptation of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" definitely accomplishes what it set out to accomplish, but honestly, did it really have to be made? I know that kids will like this film, if for no other reason than the joy of seeing cute CG rodents on the big screen. I don't debate the fact that this is a good-looking film, and to some extent, it is fun--or rather, about as fun as simple films can be. But that doesn't mean that it was necessary, and I have no doubt that adults will feel the exact same way. I don't know what original ""Chipmunks"" creator Ross Bagdasarian would have to say about this film, but I suppose it doesn't really matter. At the very least, he would have been glad to hear Dave's trademark shout: ""Allllllviiiiiin!""",3,Celebrity in a Nutshell,1197590400,"12 14, 2007",2007,5008,"['Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'cute', 'film',

1129451,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00113O7MM,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","The latest incarnation of the late David Seville's fuzzy musical rodents is a definite winner.We are first introduced to the brothers, Simon (the smart one), Alvin (the ""awesomest""), and Theodore, (the sweet sensitive one) in their natural habitat, a mountainous area with pine trees as they struggle to store nuts while singing the cutest version of ""You Had a Bad Day"", harmonizing perfectly.Strangely, the humans about to cut down their tree don't notice their singing. But their adventure begins when their habitat is hauled away by truck with them inside, and their tree is decorated for display in the lobby of a recording studio where they have their first encounter  with Dave Seville (Jason Lee), an amature songwriter whose latest idea has just been rejected by college mate, Ian (David Cross) the head and CEO of Jett Records.Leaving behind their  tree, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore ( voiced by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Guber, and Jesse McCartney) stowaway in the basket of muffins a dejected Dave stole from Ian's office.Once in Dave's home, the trio initially get off on the wrong foot. But once Dave realizes they can sing, he lets them stay, and is inspired to continue pursuing a career as a songwriter.Childish missteps and faux pas from the trio--especially Alvin-- test Dave's patience, and in the meantime, he works to rekindle a romance with his ex-girlfriend, Claire (Cameron Richards).Soon, Ian gets wind of the trio's vocal abilities, and they rocket to fame. Dave is a careful and frugal surrogate parent to the critters he slowly comes to view as his children. But Ian seduces them away from Dave, and they end up spoiled, overworked, and mistreated. The scene where Baby Theodore realizes that Ian lacks the true affection Dave showed for him and his brothers might result in a charge of animal  cruelty in real life, and there is a wistful moment where we watch the little critter wander away hurt and disillusioned.But when they see how much Dave cares for them, the ending is predictable, and life for the musical, mischeivous, one-liner-filled ""Fab furs"" ends literally on a happy note.There is a bit of unnecessary crassness in this production, but 50 years after his singing chipmunks first became a sensation, David Seville can rest assured that his legacy is in very good hands.",5,Unabashedly Cute,1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,2312,"['latest', 'incarnation', 'late', 'David', 'Seville', 'fuzzy', 'musical', 'rodents', 'definite', 'winner.We', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'brothers', 'Simon', 'smart', 'one', 'Alvin', 'awesomest', 'Theodore', 'sweet', 'sensitive', 'one', 'natural', 'habitat', 'mountainous', 'area', 'pine', 'trees', 'struggle', 'store', 'nuts', 'singing', 'cutest', 'version', 'Had', 'Bad', 'Day', 'harmonizing', 'perfectly.Strangely', 'humans', 'cut', 'down', 'tree', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'singing', 'adventure', 'when', 'habitat', 'hauled', 'away', 'truck', 'inside', 'tree', 'decorated', 'display', 'lobby', 'recording', 'studio', 'where', 'have', 'first', 'encounter', 'Dave', 'Seville', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'amature', 'songwriter', 'latest', 'idea', 'just', 'been', 'rejected', 'college', 'mate', 'Ian', 'David', 'Cross', 'head', 'CEO', 'Jett', 'Records.Leaving', 'tree', 'Alvin', 'Simon', 'Theodore', 'voiced', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Guber', 'Jesse', 'McCartney', 'stowaway', 'basket', 'muffins', 'dejected', 'Dave', 'stole', 'Ian', 'office.Once', 'Dave', 'home', 'trio', 'initially', 'get', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'once', 'Dave', 'can', 'sing', 'stay', 'inspired', 'continue', 'pursuing', 'career', 'songwriter.Childish', 'missteps', 'faux', 'pas', 'trio', 'especially', 'Alvin', 'test', 'Dave', 'patience', 'meantime', 'rekindle', 'romance', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Claire', 'Cameron', 'Richards', '.Soon', 'Ian', 'wind', 'trio', 'vocal', 'abilities', 'rocket', 'fame', 'Dave', 'careful', 'frugal', 'surrogate', 'parent', 'critters', 'slowly', 'view', 'children', 'Ian', 'away', 'Dave', 'end', 'up', 'spoiled', 'overworked', 'mistreated', 'scene', 'where', 'Baby', 'Theodore', 'Ian', 'true', 'affection', 'Dave', 'showed', 'brothers', 'might', 'result', 'charge', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'real', 'life', 'wistful', 'moment', 'where', 'watch', 'little', 'critter', 'wander', 'away', 'hurt', 'disillusioned.But', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'Dave', 'cares', 'ending', 'predictable', 'life', 'musical', 'mischeivous', 'one-liner-filled', 'Fab', 'furs', 'literally', 'happy', 'note.There', 'bit', 'unnecessary', 'crassness', 'production', '50', 'years', 'singing', 'chipmunks', 'first', 'became', 'sensation', 'David', 'Seville', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'legacy', 'very', 'good', 'hands']",Alvin and the Chipmunks [Theatrical Release]

I felt sick every time I heard it on the radio. I just haven't been able to listen to Chipmunk music or view them since that  time. I tell you this as a matter of disclosure so you may understand my review better.My wife likes animated cartoons and we watch them now and then, too often as far as I'm concerned. A few weeks ago, she purchased an ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" DVD. Groan. Of course, we'd have to view it. Well, last night we viewed it. It was interesting in that the movie was filmed in a conventional fashion and then the animated chipmunks were added to the film as if they had been live at the scenes. It's a clever animation technique, without question. The animated Chipmunks therefore appeared to be interacting with the filmed characters. I suppose it must be difficult to get everything synchronized and in perfect order. The directors didn't. In a lot of places, the chipmunk characters were not in the focus of the actors and you could clearly see the actors were performing on their own. I could cite other glitches, but that would probably be considered too picky.In any case, I suppose I noticed such things because I found the animation rather interesting, but didn't find the movie itself all that interesting. The human acting seemed stiff and unnatural and the actors interfaced with the animated characters only poorly. The story line was weak and uninteresting. Three singing Chipmunks get discovered and work their way to the top of the charts. Yawn. There weren't many substantial laughs unless you like slapstick. In short, the movie was a waste of viewing  time. However, the animated chipmunks themselves were rather well done, if not a little too cutsiepoo.I'm really burned out on Chipmunk music, especially that Christmas thing. However, some of the new songs in up-to-date styles with dance routines were mildly amusing. That's about it, folks. View it at your own discretion, it's your dime. I can't comprehend how adults could watch this, but I think that small kids (under six) might find it enjoyable.

It's true they pay people to design these covers, but I nearly always think they'd be better with actual stills, especially in the case of animation. Forget that bad marketing decision, and slip in the disc. Immediately you're transformed back to the whimsical sense of the original ""The Chipmunk Song"" which took radio by storm so many decades ago, and for those lucky enough to remember it, to the great '60s cartoon, ""The Alvin Show"". At the end of the film, the credits even include some of the sleeves for the singles and albums, including Chipmunk Punk, the album that spurred the Chipmunk revival and their eventual return to TV.This film is a lot better than I expected, and the interview with Ross Bagdasarian explains why. He and Janice had the sense to try and make a family movie that wasn't dumbed down and stupefying. ABC Family, whose motto ought to be ""No Kind of Family"" could take a lesson here. Alvin has style and verve without trying to be Adult Swim. Jason Lee is dead on as Dave Seville, although the cartoon Dave yelled ""Alllvin!"" more often.The Chipmunk Song arrives in a suitably ramped up version, but one wonders why Dave Bagdasarian's other early radio hit, ""The Witchdoctor"" was recast in a hip hop/ disco/ pop mash that manages to be both overdone and a snooze at the same time (like much radio pop). In the interview Janice B. says that they wanted to keep updating the Chipmunks to keep them fresh. That led to the addition of the Chipettes in the recast TV show. That show proved a popular comeback, but later efforts smoothed off so many rough edges that the later 'toon chipmunks could pass as Care Bears. This film brings back the curious trio's animal instincts (they are Chipmunks) while echoing their individual traits as developed in the cartoons.What's missing from the mix, of course, is the '60s TV show. There's a tantalizing glimpse of it in an included featurette on the History of Chipmunkmania. This merely shows how great the modern, simple art of the '60s was compared to the later cartoons, not unlike classic ""pie-eyed"" Mickey Mouse compared to ghastly later versions as Disco Mickey. Disney had the sense to bring back the modern, retro Mickey, and hopefully the '60s The Alvin Show will also find its way onto DVD. The shows made a brief return as segments of Wienerville on Nick, which dropped the little orange Nick logo into the opening titles.Hopefully the Monks don't go Garfield, and start appearing in every style of CGI and animation possible, but rather release their extensive back catalog, and as with this film, remain true to Dave Seville AKA Bagdasarian's original vision.",5,Allllvin!,1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,2715,"['lackluster', 'cover', 'design', 'DVD', 'case', 'way', 'movie', 'true', 'pay', 'people', 'design', 'covers', 'nearly', 'always', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'actual', 'stills', 'especially', 'case', 'animation', 'Forget', 'bad', 'marketing', 'decision', 'slip', 'disc', 'Immediately', ""'re"", 'transformed', 'back', 'whimsical', 'sense', 'original', 'Chipmunk', 'Song', 'took', 'radio', 'storm', 'so', 'many', 'decades', 'ago', 'lucky', 'enough', 'remember', 'great', 'cartoon', 'Alvin', 'Show', 'end', 'film', 'credits', 'even', 'include', 'sleeves', 'singles', 'albums', 'including', 'Chipmunk', 'Punk', 'album', 'spurred', 'Chipmunk', 'revival', 'eventual', 'return', 'TV.This', 'film', 'lot', 'better', 'expected', 'interview', 'Ross', 'Bagdasarian', 'why', 'Janice', 'had', 'sense', 'try', 'make', 'family', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'dumbed', 'down', 'stupefying', 'ABC', 'Family', 'motto', 'ought', 'be', 'Kind', 'Family', 'could', 'take', 'lesson', 'here', 'Alvin', 'style', 'verve', 'trying', 'be', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'dead', 'Dave', 'Seville', 'cartoon', 'Dave', 'yelled', 'Alllvin', 'more', 'often.The', 'Chipmunk', 'Song', 'suitably', 'ramped', 'up', 'version', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'Dave', 'Bagdasarian', 'other', 'early', 'radio', 'hit', 'Witchdoctor', 'was', 'recast', 'hip', 'hop/', 'disco/', 'pop', 'mash', 'be', 'overdone', 'snooze', 'same', 'time', 'much', 'radio', 'pop', 'interview', 'Janice', 'B.', 'wanted', 'keep', 'updating', 'Chipmunks', 'keep', 'fresh', 'led', 'addition', 'Chipettes', 'recast', 'TV', 'show', 'show', 'proved', 'popular', 'comeback', 'later', 'efforts', 'smoothed', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'rough', 'edges', 'later', 'chipmunks', 'could', 'pass', 'Care', 'Bears', 'film', 'back', 'curious', 'trio', 'animal', 'instincts', 'are', 'Chipmunks', 'echoing', 'individual', 'traits', 'developed', 'cartoons.What', 'missing', 'mix', 'course', ""'60s"", 'TV', 'show', 'tantalizing', 'glimpse', 'included', 'featurette', 'History', 'Chipmunkmania', 'merely', 'how', 'great', 'modern', 'simple', 'art', ""'60s"", 'was', 'compared', 'later', 'cartoons', 'not', 'classic', 'pie-eyed', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'compared', 'ghastly', 'later', 'versions', 'Disco', 'Mickey', 'Disney', 'had', 'sense', 'bring', 'back', 'modern', 'retro', 'Mickey', 'hopefully', 'Alvin', 'Show', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'way', 'DVD', 'shows', 'made', 'brief', 'return', 'segments', 'Wienerville', 'Nick', 'dropped', 'little', 'orange', 'Nick', 'logo', 'opening', 'titles.Hopefully', 'Monks', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'Garfield', 'start', 'appearing', 'style', 'CGI', 'animation', 'possible', 'rather', 'release', 'extensive', 'back', 'catalog', 'film', 'remain', 'true', 'Dave', 'Seville', 'AKA', 'Bagdasarian', 'original', 'vision']",Alvin and the Chipmunks [Theatrical Release]

They turn it into a giant playground. They tear apart the food packages in his cabinets, and flood his home. Before long, his home is a disaster area. But he works out a deal with them to stay with him. They clean the place up.His girlfriend, with whom he has had an off-and-on relationship, is puzzled by what turns out to be his chipmunk-hiding behavior and his crazy remarks about talking chipmunks. Not exactly an auspicious way to re-win her heart!Imagine having an important poster presentation at work, only to find out, during the actual presentation, that the chipmunks had drawn crayon figures all over it? What a way for Dave to lose his job!It takes some time for Dave to persuade others that the chipmunks can sing. Owing to stage fright, they fail to perform in front of Ian Hawke, his associate. But eventually they do, and Hawke thinks up of ways to use the chipmunks in accordance with his selfish desires. Yet, for a time, the chipmunks perform in front of audiences with Dave. Then it is Ian Hawke's turn.This movie is about much more than chipmunk antics and performances. It is a testimony to the human condition. David Seville, though often annoyed by the chipmunks' disruption of his house and of his life, nevertheless cares about them. After one of the chipmunks has a nightmare, Dave comforts him. Not so with Ian Hawke, who scoffs at another case of a chipmunk with a nightmare and dismisses him from his bedroom. In fact, Hawke can think of only one thing--MONEY. He dreams up extensive and creative ways of getting rich off the chipmunks' performances, and comes up with a grueling schedule for them. All along, he has no regard for their needs or wishes. When they get exhausted, he simply keeps them going with a coffee-bearing drink. When a veterinarian confirms the severity of the exhaustion, Ian forces them to perform anyway--albeit without singing while the music is playing.Before long, the chipmunks long to return to Dave. The feelings are mutual. So Ian tells them lies about Dave no longer wanting to have anything to with them, and of calling them rats. Ian tells Dave, over the phone, that the chipmunks have moved on and love it with him. Just to make sure, Ian posts guards to prevent Dave from ever coming to see them. Will they ever get free of the exploitative Ian and see their beloved Dave again?",5,"The Playful Chipmunks, the Benevolent David Seville, and the Greedy Ian Hawke",1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,2461,"['lovely', 'chipmunks', 'Simon', 'Theodore', 'Alvin', 'enter', 'Dave', 'Seville', 'home', 'turn', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'turn', 'giant', 'playground', 'tear', 'apart', 'food', 'packages', 'cabinets', 'flood', 'home', 'long', 'home', 'disaster', 'area', 'out', 'deal', 'stay', 'clean', 'place', 'up.His', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'had', 'off-and-on', 'relationship', 'puzzled', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'chipmunk-hiding', 'behavior', 'crazy', 'remarks', 'talking', 'chipmunks', 'Not', 'exactly', 'auspicious', 'way', 're-win', 'heart', 'Imagine', 'having', 'important', 'poster', 'presentation', 'work', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'actual', 'presentation', 'chipmunks', 'had', 'drawn', 'crayon', 'figures', 'What', 'way', 'Dave', 'lose', 'job', 'time', 'Dave', 'persuade', 'others', 'chipmunks', 'can', 'sing', 'Owing', 'stage', 'fright', 'fail', 'perform', 'front', 'Ian', 'Hawke', 'associate', 'eventually', 'do', 'Hawke', 'ways', 'use', 'chipmunks', 'accordance', 'selfish', 'desires', 'time', 'chipmunks', 'perform', 'front', 'audiences', 'Dave', 'Then', 'Ian', 'Hawke', 'turn.This', 'movie', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'chipmunk', 'antics', 'performances', 'testimony', 'human', 'condition', 'David', 'Seville', 'though', 'often', 'annoyed', 'chipmunks', 'disruption', 'house', 'life', 'nevertheless', 'one', 'chipmunks', 'nightmare', 'Dave', 'Not', 'so', 'Ian', 'Hawke', 'who', 'case', 'chipmunk', 'nightmare', 'bedroom', 'fact', 'Hawke', 'can', 'think', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'MONEY', 'up', 'extensive', 'creative', 'ways', 'getting', 'rich', 'chipmunks', 'performances', 'up', 'grueling', 'schedule', 'along', 'regard', 'needs', 'wishes', 'When', 'get', 'exhausted', 'simply', 'keeps', 'going', 'coffee-bearing', 'drink', 'When', 'veterinarian', 'severity', 'exhaustion', 'Ian', 'perform', 'anyway', 'singing', 'music', 'playing.Before', 'long', 'chipmunks', 'long', 'return', 'Dave', 'feelings', 'are', 'mutual', 'So', 'Ian', 'Dave', 'no', 'longer', 'wanting', 'have', 'anything', 'calling', 'rats', 'Ian', 'Dave', 'phone', 'chipmunks', 'have', 'moved', 'love', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'Ian', 'guards', 'prevent', 'Dave', 'ever', 'coming', 'see', 'ever', 'get', 'free', 'exploitative', 'Ian', 'see', 'beloved', 'Dave', 'again']",Alvin and the Chipmunks [Theatrical Release]

The first is to follow the storyline for what it appears to be and the other is to see the story for what it really is.What we see is a man who adopts three young chipmunks and begins a record career with them. What we're supposed to see, however, is a man, perhaps mid to late thirties, and his frantic, feeble cry for help.Exhibit A: ""Dave"", if that is his real name, is the quintessential metro- male, possessing a lavish garden full of fresh flowers, an immaculate house that doesn't so much as show a hint of dust throughout, and a wardrobe that would make even the fastest trigger-tongued females pause out of respect for his delicate taste and touch. And yet, poor Dave can't catch a break. He's creepily overbearing with the ladies (and on a side note, there is enough eye-candy in this film to keep most men delightfully happy) and his entire demeanor screams one deft-defying truth as we psycho-analyze poor and pathetic Davey: that he is celibate, has been so for a VERY long time, and in an effort to proscribe the immensity of his innate desires, creates three fictitious ""chipmunks"" as a form of psychotic catharis. They are to him the elements that drive the demons away at night as he rocks himself to sleep in the fetal position, the saviors who keep his mind occupied when his hot neighbor walks by in a bouncy-bounce blousey-blouse. They are figments of poor Dave's baseless soul.So our lesson is clear, kids. Celibacy is a good thing for a while, but not forever.

Hollywood loves to recycle pop culture because most of its moguls lack even a modicum of creativity or originality so the long-ago Christmas chipmunks (the three of them) are unleashed again in this mindless movie.It seems like it's for kids, but the path toward success in the music business seems like an adult theme to me. It's a mixing of adult ambitions and themes with some cute animal characters. I think kids will enjoy it because the chipmunks are always creating a mess and mayhem in the movie, defying adult authority. But it seems to me that a real kids' movie should deal more with fantasy and less with a quest for materialistic success.I couldn't understand the words of the chipmunks years ago when they were singing the Christmas song, and I couldn't understand much of what they said in this movie. Either they were really talking chipmunk or else a foreign language; whatever it is, to me they are incomprehensible. I don't think it matters because the dialogue is inane anyway. Turn on you English subtitles to find out what they are saying--if you really care.Giving animals human traits, humanizing them (anthropomorphism) is as old as storytelling. This appeals to kids because then the animals can seem like friends, toys, or pets.I saw this DVD in Blue Ray, and the colors were gaudy and flamboyant, wildly way too colorful and bright.

That Night in His Home, Sad and Alone, He Meets The 3 Singing Chipmunks Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. After The Chipmunks Get Famous With Thier First Hit Song, ''The Chipkmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)'', Jett Records Producer Ian Takes Invatege of The Chipmunk Trio and Takes Them Away By Telling a Lie Saying That Dave Dosn't Care One Bit About Them. The Chipmunks (Unfortunatly) Fall For It and Decide To Stay With Ian. Now It's Up To Dave To Get The Chipmunks Back Before It's Too Late.I Was Surprised By How Eaisly Great and Fun The Film Was. It's A Kids Movie For Kids, But If Your an Adult Who's Grown Up With The Chipmunks I Recommend You Watch With Your Kids. I Would've Given The Film 5 Stars, But The reason I'm Giving It One Star Less Than I Expected To Give It, Was Mainly The Acting Choice of Jason Lee as Dave Seville. Jason Lee Dosn't Make a Very Realistic Dave Seville, He Just Seems Like About Every Carecter He's Played Just More Dramatic, But Most of The Time, It Dosn't Work. Maybe if Thay Got Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. To Play The Live-Action Dave Seville, I Think It Would Be More Dramatic and Comidical Than The Way Jason Lee Did It. The Actors Who Were Cosen To Play The Chipmunk Trio Were Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, and Jesse McCartney, These 3 Do A Fantastic Job Voicing Them and Thay Make These 3 Singing Chipmunks Beliveable and Fun. The Visuals for The Singing Trio Very Belivable as Well.SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE-Chip-Chip Hooray A Chipmunk History-Hitting The Harmony The Chipmunks Music-Sneak Peek at Horton Hears A WhoThe ''Chip-Chip Hooray'' Feature is The Best Feature on The DVD.

1129485,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00113O7MM,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 1]","I never would have dreamed that someone would decide to adapt the trio of singing chipmunks known as Alvin and the Chipmunks into a feature film. Yet, here we are, 50 years after their initial debut, getting to see a live-action version of the cute furry guys in action on the big screen. When I first saw the advertisements for ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" my expectations were rather low, mostly because the chipmunks had been removed from the realm of pop culture since the early to mid nineties, and the fact that I haven't been overly impressed with some of the other animated cartoons that have made the jump to the big screen as of late, most recently the below average adaptation of ""Underdog"". So, I thought that any attempt to bring the chipmunks to the big screen would result in a mixed bag of good CGI effects to bring the chipmunks to life, updated and/or butchered versions of some of their classic songs that fans love, and an overall too cute and kid friendly storyline that would be so insipid for any adult to actually tolerate sitting through. However, after renting the movie for my kids to watch, and I of course sat down to watch it with them out of curiosity, I am surprised to say that I was actually impressed by how good this modern adaptation of the classic cartoon turned out to be.""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is the story of three talented singing chipmunks named Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, as they rise to stardom in the music business thanks to their songwriter/mentor Dave Seville (Jason Lee). As their popularity increases, a greedy record producer (David Cross) double-crosses Dave and causes Alvin and the gang to mistrust him, thus taking control of the burgeoning career of the chipmunks and pushes the three loveable brothers to their limits and will not stop until he has milked them for all they're worth. Now, it's up to Dave to find a way to win back the trust of his beloved chipmunks, and bring them back to the only place they want to be... home.As far as cartoon adaptations into feature films go, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is definitely one of the better ones in my opinion. I've seen the two `Garfield' films, which were cute, and then the ""Underdog"" movie, which didn't amount to much in terms of entertainment value, and ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"", is by far much more of an entertaining movie than any of those other ones. Director Tim Hill has done a very good job of mixing the modern song styles of today with the classic sounds of some of the chipmunks' famous songs, and he does so without compromising the appeal of those beloved songs. Tim Hill has improved his ability to adapt classic cartoon characters into a feature film when compared to his previous effort, the second film in the `Garfield' series, ""Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties"" which was an average movie at best. This time around he has better tools at his disposal, such as; much more polished CGI characters with the chipmunks, somewhat better actors, and the film's story is much more fulfilling for children and adults thus creating a better overall movie experience for the whole family.The CGI created chipmunks were very good for 99% of the movie, they weren't completely photo-realistic due to more exaggerated and cartoonish facial features and expressions, and of course the fact that they could talk and sing, and wear clothes, but they fit in nicely in this movie. As good as the CGI was throughout the movie, there was one scene that stuck out to me as being not quite as polished as the others. The scene I am referring to is where Alvin is taking a shower in Dave's dishwasher, even though it was an extremely cute and funny scene, the Alvin character model looked way too stiff and jerky in his movements, having an almost stop-motion feel to him. I don't know if this was brought on by the mixing of CGI water, a wet animated character, and steam together or what; but, the scene definitely stood out to me, and left me feeling as if the visual effects crew could have spent a little more time to perfect that scene and the movie's effects would have been essentially flawless.The actors all did a good job and thankfully chose not to ham it up too much on screen. Given the type of movie they were in, I'm sure the temptation was there, but they resisted much to the movie's benefit. Jason Lee was a good choice for Dave Seville, the chipmunks' songwriter/mentor/father-figure, but I do have one complaint about his performance. I don't believe that Jason really sold the yelling of Alvin's name during the Christmas song, and other various times throughout the movie. Each time he yelled ""ALVIN!"", I felt it was too forced and unnatural, which is a problem for me because that line is such an integral part of Dave's character and is something that fans of the animated series and songs know all too well. To have that aspect of the character not work perfectly comes off as a weak point in the movie for me, but I digress. Actor and comedian, David Cross was perfectly sniveling and obnoxious as the slimy record producer that wants to cash in on the chipmunk brand, bringing his signature sarcasm and wit to the character, even throwing in a few one-liners that would be funnier to adults than kids. The voice cast for the chipmunks were comprised of some of Hollywood's up-and-coming acting talents, such as; Justin Long (Alvin), Jesse McCartney (Theodore), and Matthew Gray Gubler (Simon). The choice to include decently recognizable names to voice these characters would have been a wise decision had their voices not been modified; however, due to the fact that their voices were recorded at half-speed and sped up to normal speed to create the chipmunk sound, having recognizable actors providing the voices seemed rather pointless. I mean there was no distinguishable quality to identify that Alvin's voice was that of `The Mac Guy' in the PC and Mac commercials from TV, so I don't understand the logic behind that decision to go with somewhat recognizable actors over unknowns, but I'm not the one that makes these decisions so maybe to some Hollywood suit this choice made sense, you've got me though.""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is one of those rare live-action movies aimed primarily at kids that adults can enjoy as well. The movie actually manages to avoid the pitfall of oversimplifying everything in the story for kids; instead, opting to create a heartwarming and updated re-telling of a classic animated series that successfully introduces the characters of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore to a whole new generation to enjoy, and gives those that are familiar with them already a nice walk down memory lane.""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is rated PG for mildly rude humor.",4,Get Your Squeak On...,1208563200,"04 19, 2008",2008,6714,"['never', 'would', 'have', 'dreamed', 'someone', 'would', 'decide', 'adapt', 'trio',

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[4, 4]","Growing up, one of my earliest memories is of listening to an ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" album that spoofed the ""Urban Cowboy"" soundtrack.  I have no idea what happened to that album, but I do remember that it hooked me on Alvin and company for good.  I watched the cartoon series that came out in the 80's and even saw a few of the old cartoons.  When I saw that Alvin and the gang were headed for the big screen, I had two thoughts:  a) This will be the single worst live action remake ever or b) It just might be fun.  Luckily for me and my daughter, ""b"" was the correct thought.  When this film came out in theaters, I took my daughter to see it and both of us laughed throughout the film.  Jason Lee does an amazing job as kind-hearted Dave Seville, and the voices for the chipmunks, Justin Long (Alvin), Matthew Gray Gubler (Simon), and Jesse McCartney (Theodore), have their respective characters penned perfectly.The story revolves around Dave finding the chipmunks in his home at Christmas time and then finding out that they can not only talk, but can sing a mean tune as well.  Desperate for money-making song, Dave takes the chipmunks to his record-producer friend, Ian (David Cross in one of his best roles yet), who doesn't believe Dave at first.  Once he discovers the truth, Ian promotes the chipmunks to death in order to drain every dollar he can out of them.  Eventually the chipmunks turn on Dave, and run to the lap of luxury that Ian promises them.  In the end, though, this turns out to be a film about the strength of the family, no matter how different it might be.The DVD comes with both the full and widescreen versions of the film, as well as some decent special features.  The best of those features is an in-depth look at the creation and creator of the chipmunks, Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.I thought very hard on giving this film five stars.  It's just that good of a family film.  Sure, there's a little crude humor but the tale is strong enough that most will be able to look beyond that.  In the end, I have to give ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" a very, very sold four stars.  I highly recommend it to anybody with children or anyone who wants to recall some wonderful old memories.",4,Alvin And Co.

We probably were the oldest people to go and see it voluntarily because mostly children under the age of twelve were there with their parents.  By the end of the movie my mom still didn't like it, but admitted it probably wasn't as bad as she thought it was going to be.  As for me, I LOVED IT!!!I ended up buying it and my best friend that I live with has a one year old baby and it is one of his favorite movies so it works out really well even though his mom is annoyed by it for the most part.I am not sure if I love it because I have fond memories of watching the 1908's incarnation the of the Chipmunks or because I love music or both...  Either way I thought that they very accurately represented what the television show was about: Family.  Even though it is about a man raising three chipmunks, it is really just about a single man taking in three orphans and learning to love them as his own.  The great thing about the movie is that it also plays very well on the perils of fame and how hard the entertainment industry is on children.  On top of that has great music and a great sense of humor.Granted, many adults like my friends and mother, will find this movie to be very obnoxious, but if you have children or are a kid at heart, you need to get this movie!!!

The chipmunks are adorable and it's clever, cute and very entertaining.Jason Lee plays Dave Seville who is a struggling songwriter.  When he finds the chipmunks in his kitchen (their tree got cut down to make a Christmas tree and they ended up in the city), he throws them out only to hear them singing later and begins to think that they could bring him success.  He lets them stay with him if they sing his songs.  There is Alvin who is voiced really well by Justin Long and the mischievous leader of the trio; brainy Simon and cute and chubby Theodore (I love the scene with them having a shower in Dave's dishwasher).  But Daves friend Ian wants to break up this happy group to exploit the chipmunks.It's such a cute movie that is funny and so entertaining and even though it's not the kind of movie to watch over and over again, it's certainly worth buying to look at everynow and then.

1129501,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00113O7MM,Mark Turner,"[4, 4]","For many of us our childhood was filled with the memory of three little voices singing in beautiful high pitched harmony. Granted those voices were sped up singers whose altered versions were representing three loveable rodents, but to us it didn't matter. Alvin and the Chipmunks were as real as anything else on TV. Now, Alvin and his brothers Simon and Theodore receive an update and it's not half bad.David Seville (Jason Lee of MY NAME IS EARL) is a down on his luck songwriter whose songs are too cutesy for ex-friend and mega mogul record producer Ian (David Cross). But all that changes when he inadvertently comes across three singing chipmunks that turn his song about Christmas wishes into what is a potential blockbuster. Once Ian hears the song and realizes the potential, he comes across big time with a set up that will make the boys stars.Dave, while trying to set boundaries up letting the three know that they are working together and nothing more, begins to grow attached to the little guys. He may be strict on a few items but he has their best interests at heart. Not so Ian.Ian sees nothing more than dollar signs when he hears them singing. He begins a campaign to lure them away and make them the latest pop sensations of the world. His lavishing of gifts and wooing of the boys via their egos results in Dave being left behind while Alvin and his brothers live a life of luxury and non stop toys.But all of this comes with a price as the chipmunks are worked non-stop. New records, merchandise and a worldwide concert tour take their toll and they reach a point of exhaustion. Too bad Ian sees them only as rodents that are there to do nothing more than increase the size of his wallet.It's up to Dave and his old girlfriend to save the day and rescue Alvin, Simon and Theodore. But will they be too late? Will the boys finally realize that Dave was right all along? And will Ian be able to stop any attempt at rescue that is made?Okay face it, you know the outcome of a movie like this. It's not the answer to that question that makes you watch. It's more about the interplay between the characters, even if three of them are computer generated. You still find yourselves attracted to the cute little guys and want the best for them.The movie features over the top performances by all cast members, but that should be expected in a movie aimed at the elementary school level audience.

Tagliaferro,"[0, 1]","It should come as no surprise that an adult who dragged her best friend to see Ratatouille would add Alvin and the Chipmunks to her must see list.  Naturally my opinion would be biased based on my passion for cute, little, animated rodents whose furry appeal outweighs any fault of a movie script, still after reading some negative comments, I must post a review of my own.While some critics attributed the young adult appeal to the 1980's cartoon version of the Chipmunks, they are overlooking the fact that the Chipmunks date back to the baby boomers, and their legendary fame rides on their yearly revived Christmas classic.  They are also undermining the effect of an identifying hit song and the fact that a high pitched tune, supposedly sung by animals is enough to bring adults back to the point where they once believed.  And since I haven't seen such comingling of humans and animation since Roger Rabbit, I'm inclined to think Simon, Theodore, and Alvin are real.The film starts with these lovable critters fending for themselves in the forest until they get swept away with their Christmas tree that gets hauled into the office of Jett Records where Dave Seville is trying to sell his latest song.  No longer of interest to the company's top executive ""Uncle"" Ian, a discouraged Seville takes off after reclaiming a basket of muffins, where the chipmunks sought refuge after abandoning their tree.  Dave unknowingly takes them home, and the rest is history.Naturally their rise to fame is not all fun and games because otherwise there wouldn't be a plot, which is at best predictable, and at worse, lame.  The unscrupulous Uncle Ian could have ended up penniless, since he would have been dragged into court by the record industry, animal rights activists, and the family court system, had this been a - do I dare say it - real story.  Likewise, Seville's love life could have been more developed, and the film could have offered some explanation as to why these chipmunks were blessed with the gift of voice.  But who would go to see a movie titled Alvin and the Chipmunks for the plot???For one adult who was taken in by the main attraction, this movie made me a believer.  I actually thought the beginning of the movie was semi-biographical of Dave Seville's life.  Could he have been a songwriter who was told that no human would record his songs?  Could it have been rejection that inspired him to create the chipmunks?The answer to both questions is ""No.""  Dave Seville, like Santa, is fictional, as it is a stage name for the Chipmunk's true creator Ross Bagasarian, for whom the movie was rightfully dedicated.  But it's the name ""Seville"" that comes to life with every shout of ""Alvin!""

But then again, that's what happens when you rely on an opinion. The best way to judge a movie is if it peaks your interest, go see it. If we see a commerical for a movie and it slightly peaks our interest then we wait for it to be released on DVD.The story follows 3 chipmunks, Alvin and his brothers; Theodore (the one with the baby fat) and Simon (the intelligent one with the glasses). Remember the popular cartoon Alvin and the Chipmunks? Anyway, after their tree is cut down by man, they cross paths with Dave Saville (Jason Lee from My Name is Earl and A Guy Thing), who is a struggling music writer. Dave thinks hes found his big break (he gets an idea to create a Christmas song that most of us had heard on the radio during Christmas time) and tries to convince Ian (David Cross from Men in Black 2 and Scary Movie 2) who is the chairman of Jett Records. They get cold feet. At times the little fury cuties get on Dave's nerves as he hasn't fully accepted them in his house. When Alvin and the Chipmunks go to Ian to try to fix their relationship with Dave, they inadvertnly cause themselves harm. Ian sees visions of money...in his pockets. He cooks up a scheme to lure the chipmunks (who are just kids) away from Dave so he can put them through a grueling European concert tour and a whole lot more. Enriching himself at the expense of the chipmunks. Will Ian succeed? Will Dave be able to save them?This movie was very cute. The chipmunks while they are a product of CGI animation, they were so adorable. The movie does take place right before Christmas so it seems like a holiday movie. The movie does have its funny parts, drama, and heart warming charm. I will admit that I was like,"" Awwwwwwww"", when Theordore had a nightmare and asked Dave if he can sleep in his bed that night. Dave reluctantly said yes and told him to sleep on the other side of the bed, however Theordore cuddled up on Dave's forehead and wrapped himself in a little ball. So cute! While the animated cartoon Alvin and the Chipmunks wasn't at the top of my list when it was on ( I liked Scooby Doo, The Jetsons, He-man, The Gobots, Heathcliff, Tom and Jerry, The Real Ghostbusters, The Ghostbusters, Woody Woodpecker, Space Ghost, Transformers, and the Hurculoids; just to name a few ;-), this movie was indeed very cute with some spirts of comedy. I will admit that I did watch the cartoon when it was on before I had to go to school.Hardly any foul language. Just one minor possible issue. Watch out for the part when the chipmunks are singing, Ian says,"" Make love to the music."" Awkward moment alert! This is the only part that might make parents squirm but the scene moves very quickly so it will be unnoticed. I just happened to hear it, most times I'm oblivious, lol until I've watched a movie several times.The movie has both fullscreen and Widescreen versions on one disc. Side A has fullscreen and side B is widescreen. The movie looked great on a LCD TV and playing it on a 1080p upconverting DVD (recordable) player showed an even beautiful picture.

1129516,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00113O7MM,Monty Moonlight,"[2, 3]","Dave Seville is a struggling songwriter in need of some special inspiration. Just when he is at the end of his rope, his house is invaded by three stowaways from a muffin basket that are just what the witch doctor ordered! Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, the three chipmunk brothers who now live with Dave and perform his songs, are just kids out to have some fun, but they rapidly become the biggest new singing group in the country. It's all good until music mogul Ian Hawke woos the boys away from Dave and his unintentionally parental influence. Pushing them into the fast lane that is the rock star lifestyle, ""Uncle Ian"" exploits and overworks the Chipmunks while Dave worries and wonders on how to get them back.When the ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movie poster started appearing in theaters featuring the three famous 'munks in hip hop threads and CGI quasi-realistic form, most longtime fans cringed. There was a lot of bias against this movie long before it ever came out, and I'd say most of this was the result of an unnecessarily misleading poster and trailer making us expect the boys to be unrecognizably urbanized, a new, realistic look and size that is nothing like the most recent and popular vision of the Chipmunks from the 1980's animated TV series and follow-up movies (1 bigscreen and at least 2 direct-to-video), the general distaste held by at least half of animation fans for live-action/CGI interpretations of their beloved characters, and a distaste from much of the public for family films in general. I'd say the reason the film rates so many stars on Amazon.com is because reviewers here actually saw the film before dissing it. Sure, you'll still have some nay-sayers, folks who can't get past the none-too original family-film plot points like the exploitative record producer and the guy learning to be a parental figure, but if you focus on everything else you will find this to be an excellent film that is great fun and just better and better with repeat viewings!So, what's so great about this movie? Well, to first address the realistic look/size of the Chipmunks in this film and the less passive Dave than the '80's/'90's version: Jason Lee, cleverly cast as David Seville, is more reminiscent of the original Dave based on Ross Bagdasarian, Sr. (Chipmunks creator and original voice of Dave and the boys) than his '80's counterpart. Let's not forget that the Chipmunks originated in 1958, not in the '80's when their now popular redesigns came about as a result of Bagdasarian, Jr. and wife Janice Karman bringing them back. Keeping that in mind, the Chipmunks were music stars before they were ever animated, and on their early album covers they appeared looking very much like real chipmunks. So, the film versions of both Dave and the Chipmunks themselves are quite appropriate for a first live-action movie. It was probably a wise choice to go to the source material for inspiration rather than trying to adapt the '80's show to live-action (though we'd still hope to see some influence from the '80's in any likely sequels, such as the Chipmunks attending school and encountering the Chipettes). Also a very happy thing about the film is that the characters are not as ""street"" as they appear in the promotional material. In fact, their personalities and voices (despite being voiced by big celebs for some reason) are spot on, just as we've always known them. Yes, the movie is pretty predictable. Dave meets the Chipmunks and together they form a band and a family, with a record producer thrown in as a villain to make it a real feature film. David Cross is hilarious as usual as the slimy record producer, by the way. But it's all about the very fun ride and seeing the Chipmunk origin story told in a grand, modern, live-action scale. There are some nice moments to make it a Christmas fave, the performances are fine (remember that these live-action actors had to play against thin air), the CGI is great, and there's a lot of terrific humor in it too. The driving force though, naturally, is the wonderful Chipmunk music, which sounds better than ever! Flawlessly updated, the songs keep the mood lively and fun throughout the film. In the opening scene, the mood is set beautifully by the Chipmunks doing their own amazing version of ""Bad Day"", and we are also treated to a dazzling bit of Chipmunk ""Funky Town"", not to mention updated versions of beloved classics ""The Chipmunk Song"" (Christmas Don't Be Late) and ""Witch Doctor""! And there are many other fantastic tunes too! Even after you've watched the film repeatedly, you'll find yourself running the DVD over and over again just for the musical numbers!The DVD itself is rather weak in the extras department. It's a double-sided disc (widescreen on one side, fullscreen on the other, the widescreen looking great), and there is one very nice bonus featurette on each side. Side A has a great featurette about the history of the Chipmunks up to today, and side B has a nice behind the scenes look at creating music for the Chipmunks. Unfortunately, the only other extras are previews for other stuff (there's a scene from Horton Hears a Who and a promo for the Alvin and the Chipmunks soundtrack among them). I can't come down too hard on them for so few extras though, because the featurettes, especially the retrospective, are very nice and I love the film. Still, one expects the theatrical trailer nowadays and a commentary is always great. Or maybe a classic cartoon could have been included (as was included with Underdog's live-action movie DVD). However, I did get this movie in a promotional gift set with little plush toys of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, so that was really cool. Anyway, I highly recommend this film for fans of the Chipmunks who don't mind that it goes back to its roots, especially if you just love their freaky sound. I also recommend the following live-action cartoons: Josie and the Pussycats (with the heavenly Rachael Leigh Cook), Garfield and Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties (which are flawed in the way some of the characters are portrayed, but Garfield and Odie are well done and they're cute movies), Scooby-Doo and Scooby-Doo 2 (ya love these movies or ya hate 'em, but ya gotta have a sense of humor), the Flintstones and Flintstones Viva Rock Vegas (Viva Rock Vegas is far superior, as they screwed up some of the casting in the original), Popeye (outstanding, underrated film!), Annie (fantastic musical), Dick Tracy (a work of art!), Underdog (nothing too special here, but if you like Jason Lee and live-action cartoons...), Inspector Gadget and Inspector Gadget 2 (I preferred the sequel), George of the Jungle and George of the Jungle 2 (never saw part 2), Dudley Do-Right (don't remember this one well enough to comment), the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films (classics!), Transformers (great action spectacular!), and I could mention more, but that's a good enough start. Of course, if you love Alvin and the Chipmunks, you have to see ""The Chipmunk Adventure"", ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolf Man"", and ""A Chipmunk Christmas"", all their best work outside of this new live-action feature!",5,Waaay better than the trailer and poster would lead you to believe!,1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,7148,"['Dave', 'Seville', 'struggling', 'songwriter', 'need',

There was a group of college kids, parents with children, and Tony and I, who were going to see how faithfully a contemporary film translated a childhood cartoon hero.From the laughter, booing, and general merriment, I can tell you we were all having an excellent time. This definitely was not a performance that someone who likes to view films in quiet would have enjoyed.The story:  David Seville (Jason Lee) is an advertising exec with dreams of becoming a songwriter.  He's got an 'in' with old college chum, Ian (David Cross), who is an exec with Jett Records, but still can't produce anything that anyone would want to sing.It looks like David's never going to be able to quit his day job until three chipmunks get their pine tree home chopped down and taken to the lobby of Jett Records office building. They stowaway in a basket of muffins David's swiped from Jett in a fit of pique.A few hours later, David discovers he's got an infestation of talking chipmunks--and the rest is pretty inevitable.  He writes a song, they perform it, and become a true overnight success.I won't spoil the rest of the story for you.  This is a lighthearted film that you can take your young kids to without much problem.Those of you who grew up with the Chipmunks will be pleased with the treatment.

1129534,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00113O7MM,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 2]","**1/2""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is the 2007 movie version of the old cartoon series from the 1950s and 1960s, featuring a trio of squeaky-voiced, harmonizing rodents - Simon, Theodore and the irascible Alvin - and their songwriting partner Dave Seville.  In the movie version, only the chipmunks are animated, while the humans exist and operate in the real world - if by ""real world,"" one means a place where perfectly rational human beings barely bat an eye when confronted with anthropomorphic woodland creatures that sing and dance and make a generalized nuisance of themselves.Little kids may find this film amusing and entertaining - and obviously that's its intended demographic - but for the adults in the audience, it turns out to be a pretty grueling affair overall.  I actually like the Chipmunks in small doses, but stretched out to a full-length feature - especially one as utilitarian, unimaginative and uncreative as this one is - it doesn't take long before they wear out their welcome.  Jason Lee is certainly good-natured and game, playing the human counterpart to the vocalizing chippies, and Justin Long,  Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney do a nice job reproducing the chipmunk voices, but the workmanlike screenplay and dull characters eventually take their toll.",2,lacking in imagination,1319673600,"10 27, 2011",2011,1289,"['**1/2', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', '2007', 'movie', 'version', 'old', 'cartoon', 'series', '1950s', '1960s', 'featuring', 'trio', 'squeaky-voiced', 'harmonizing', 'rodents', 'Simon', 'Theodore', 'irascible', 'Alvin', 'songwriting', 'partner', 'Dave', 'Seville', 'movie', 'version', 'only', 'chipmunks', 'are', 'animated', 'humans', 'exist', 'operate', 'real', 'world', 'real', 'world', 'one', 'place', 'where', 'perfectly', 'rational', 'human', 'beings', 'barely', 'bat', 'eye', 'when', 'confronted', 'anthropomorphic', 'woodland', 'creatures', 'sing', 'dance', 'make', 'generalized', 'nuisance', 'themselves.Little', 'kids', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'amusing', 'entertaining', 'obviously', 'intended', 'demographic', 'adults', 'audience', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'grueling', 'affair', 'overall', 'actually', 'Chipmunks', 'small', 'doses', 'stretched', 'out', 'full-length', 'feature', 'especially', 'one', 'utilitarian', 'unimaginative', 'uncreative', 'one', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'certainly', 'good-natured', 'game', 'playing', 'human', 'counterpart', 'vocalizing', 'chippies', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'Jesse', 'McCartney', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'reproducing', 'chipmunk', 'voices', 'workmanlike', 'screenplay', 'dull', 'characters', 'eventually', 'take', 'toll']",Alvin and the Chipmunks [Theatrical Release]

They were mesmerized by the silly humor. For instance, in one scene Alvin pretends to eat Theodore's poop so Dave thinks it's a raisin and doesn't get mad.The story starts with Dave, an unsuccessful song writer, who accidentally takes the chipmunks home. This is where all the fun starts. He wants them out, then finds out they can sing!  He says they can stay if they sing his music. The chipmunks grew up in a forrest with no parents, so they have NO manners. There are loads of funny scenes as they destroy his house and his social life. He is determined not to be their ""dad"", they're just friends.Enter evil uncle Ian. He is Dave and the chipmunks manager, who of course, told Dave his music stunk before the chipmunks entered the scene. On Christmas, Dave had given the boys savings bonds, which granted, is a lame gift. But he meant well, and he was thinking about their future. Uncle Ian comes in with lots of toys, setting the scene for Dave is the serious one, and uncle Ian is the fun one.Dave of course gets soft to the boys, and his desire that they have a normal childhood becomes apparent, whereas Ian just wants to make money. Ian eventually exploits the situation and the boys come to live with him. This is where the real drama comes in. You have to see the movie to find this part out. But don't worry, it has a happy ending with a nostalgic ""ALVIN!!!""The music is absolutely great.

So, of course I am going to see the movie.There was a lot of pesimistic thoughts towards it and the movie was not the best plot wise. Still a movie doesn't have to be perfect to be enjoyed by many. This movie was so adorable and fun to watch. The cartoon definitely had a huge basis around the character development and the songs played on the history of their singing career.Say what you will, but this movie was fun. If you look hard enough there are even some lessons to be told about youth in the music industry. These past few years have showed us the hardships of some young talents and how they can be troubled by fame and the media spotlight.

Lesson One: Discipline is important to children. Lesson Two: Anything in excess, even fun, can ruin your life. Lesson Three: The entertainment industry, although glamorous, can be harmful. Stable family life is more important. And dads are important role models for young sons. Alvin and his companions Simon and Theodore learn these lessons from their surrogate father Dave and from the hard knocks they endure as they leave Dave and rise to recording stardom. Seldom have I seen such an entertaining film spell out such excellent values for young children. In terms of pure fun, the chipmunks are believable and so precious they can make you cry. Jason Lee is outstanding as the caring ""dad"", Dave. The music is wonderful: great remixes of ""Witch Doctor"" and the Chipmunks Christmas song. Don't listen to the critics on this one.
