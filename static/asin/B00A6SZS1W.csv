1606106,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B00A6SZS1W,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[9, 13]","My boys (4 and 6) never get sick of Bubble Guppies and even though they recognized some of these episodes from television, they still enjoyed the DVD.  The DVD features six episodes (over two hours of Bubble Guppies fun) that are perfect to watch for any preschooler.  They are wholesome characters that work together to solve problems all while teaching kids different things.  Different jobs are featured throughout the episodes which is great to show kids how everyone is good at something and about responsibility.  The episodes make kids think too, like in ""Build Me a Building"" the Bubble Guppies are building a building and trying to figure out the best material to use to make the building sturdy.Episodes:Fishketball!A Tooth on the Looth!Build Me a Building!The Grumpfish Special!Call a Clambulance!Firefighter Gil to the Rescue!",5,6 Bubble Guppies episodes!,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,838,"['boys', '4', '6', 'never', 'get', 'sick', 'Bubble', 'Guppies', 'even', 'recognized', 'episodes', 'television', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'features', 'six', 'episodes', 'two', 'hours', 'Bubble', 'Guppies', 'fun', 'are', 'perfect', 'watch', 'preschooler', 'are', 'wholesome', 'characters', 'work', 'together', 'solve', 'problems', 'teaching', 'kids', 'different', 'things', 'Different', 'jobs', 'are', 'featured', 'episodes', 'great', 'show', 'kids', 'how', 'everyone', 'good', 'something', 'responsibility', 'episodes', 'make', 'kids', 'think', 'too', 'Build', 'Me', 'Building', 'Bubble', 'Guppies', 'are', 'building', 'building', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'best', 'material', 'use', 'make', 'building', 'sturdy.Episodes', 'Fishketball', 'Tooth', 'Looth', 'Build', 'Me', 'Building', 'Grumpfish', 'Special', 'Call', 'Clambulance', 'Firefighter', 'Gil', 'Rescue']",Bubble Guppies: On the Job!

1606108,A3V5F050GVZ56Q,B00A6SZS1W,Dre,"[57, 58]","My girls (ages 3 and 6) love the Bubble Guppies and we have a ton of the episodes on our DVR, including all of the episodes from this DVD.  They are always requesting the show.  The show is great for its vivid colors and fun songs.  It always has a positive message and teaches kids about a variety of things and occupations.  You will probably find yourself with the catchy songs stuck in your head.  The going outside song is the best.This DVD contains six great episodes.  Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:1.  Build Me a Building - They build Bubble Puppy a Dog House (very catchy song in this episode).2.  Firefighter Gill to the Rescue - Someone gets stuck in a tree and needs to be rescued.3.  Fishketball - The team learns about sports.4.  The Grumpfish Special - The Bubble Guppies help the grumpiest fish in town to a nice meal (this is probably my favorite episode).5.  Call a Clambulance - A broken tail means a trip to the doctor.6.  A Tooth on the Looth - Deema loses a tooth and gets a visit from the Tooth Fairy!We need a new Bubble Guppies DVD for car trips and this one has some favorite episodes so it is perfect.
