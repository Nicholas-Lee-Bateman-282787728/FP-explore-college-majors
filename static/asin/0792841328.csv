The Dark Half was just not complete, sort of half of what I was expecting. I can hear the irony giggling in the corner. There were some interesting things there on the screen, but whatever I found interesting was soon discarded.For example, the character of Reggie, played by the great stage actress Julie Harris, was full of potential but was on screen for about three minutes. Maybe the character is fleshed out more in the novel. I started to really like her, smoking her pipe, keeping a room decorated with creepy ventriloquist dummies and decrepit baby dolls. Weird but very interesting.The disc itself is unfortunately a shrunken fullscreen image ""formatted to fit your tv"", but it's okay because, let's face it, this isn't 'Lawrence of Arabia'.All in all, a decent brainchild of Stephen King and George Romero.

146361,A2582KMXLK2P06,0792841328,B. E Jackson,"[0, 2]","The second half, since that's the one that let me down the most and ruined the potential for some actual interest.The Dark Half is a film that had a ton of potential in the beginning- you see a little boy who enjoys writing.  One day while his mother sends him off to school, she looks outside the window of her home and sees her son fall to the ground and have a seizure before getting on the school bus.Then suddenly, while at the hospital, a flock of sparrows bang against the window.  So far the story sounds like it'd pack a SERIOUS amount of suspense, but then...They flash ahead 23 years later when the boy becomes an adult and *then* the actual storyline kicks in.This actually completely destroys the suspense and the potential the storyline COULD have had.  Now the movie becomes nothing but another boring mystery/detective film involving a writer and a series of murders.  The head cop is convinced the writer is connected to all the murders taking place, but he just can't prove it.  That about covers what the storyline is about.  Giving the writer a family (wife and two babies) was just totally pointless and did nothing of interest to make the storyline any better.Unfortunately the constant appearances by the sparrow flocks (always appearing at the silliest times), the poetic and unbelievable flow of the overdramatic plotline, and the poor writing add up to one MAJOR disappointment.  This is the only Stephen King film I can't get into no matter how hard I try.  All the characters are just so boring it becomes a chore watching the movie.  A fairly generic storyline by Stephen King's standards doesn't help matters either.  Come on, he's certainly capable of coming up with something better than this.

146366,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,0792841328,darragh o'donoghue,"[3, 7]","Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes crime stories, was a frustrated highbrow writer who resented his most famous creation, because popular demand diverted him from his more 'serious' work.  When he famously killed the sleuth off, however, such was the public outcry (including protests from the future King), that he was forced to resurrect him.A similar premise underlines George A. Romero's film, which collides 'Jekyll and Hyde' and 'The Shining' with 'The Birds'.  Thaddeus Beaumont is a professor and writer whose critically acclaimed highbrow novels sell zilch, but whose violent trash penned under the pseudonym George Stark have millions of readers...The film itself is playfully schizophrenic - the generally sombre narrative is tweaked by the appearances of Stark, whose homicidal tableaux have an odd black comedy.  Timothy Hutton clearly relishes the duality, with his earnest main role as Thaddeus undercut by his louche, Elvis-humming altar ego, in a horror twist on the Jerry Lewis classic 'The Nutty Professor'.  In a dream sequence and an imaginatively lit hallway murder scene, the director seems to borrow David Lynch's aesthetic, but mostly, 'Half' is a fine Romero film, full of his characteristically flat, static, wide-angle compositions.  Romero is the most intellectual and political of horror directors, but usually he manages to filter his ideas through action - here, too much exposition can clog the film's momentum.  The film also bears close relation to THE great cinematic Stephen King adaptation, 'The Shining', as it links creative and psychic disorder threatening the family.But Romero has different priorities to Kubrick's epic metaphysics, and certainly doesn't intend to be limited by the tired Jekyll and Hyde concept.  The film's prologue shows the young Thaddeus suffering his first attack at the moment of writing a story.  The subsequent operation reveals that within his brains rest the dead embryo of a twin.  This might seem like an over-literal visualisation of the double.  The operation is followed by a cloudburst of violent sparrows.  The date is 1968.  This was the year Romero made his breakthrough film, 'Night Of The Living Dead', a zombie movie that was an allegory for racism, Vietnam and other national crises.  1968 was America's annus horribilis, with chaotic domestic unrest, political assassinations and an unpopular war abroad.

146367,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,0792841328,David Girod,"[1, 1]","If you are a fan of Stephen King and George Romero, you had to have high expectations for ""The Dark Half"". When the two horror icons collaborated previously we got the now classic ""Creepshow"". And where ""Creepshow"" was a fun horror film focusing on laughs as well as chills, ""The Dark Half"" is a much more intense tale one perfectly suited for Romero's talents.Written in reaction to being outed as Richard Bachman, Stephen King created one bad dude in George Stark. Stark is the antagonist in ""The Dark Half"" and writer of gritty, bloody best selling crime novels. He is the alter ego to family man Thad Beaumont, author and scholarly english professor. When Beaumont is outed as the writer of the Stark novels featuring a ruthless killer known as ""The Machine"", Beaumont decides the best way to handle a potential blackmailer is to beat him to the punch by revealing himself to the press as the author George Stark, effectively killing Stark off. Soon the blood begins to flow, and the sparrows begin to fly as Stark doesn't like being ""killed"" off.Timothy Hutton does a great job playing both Beaumont and Stark. It's hard to believe that it's the same actor in both roles! Michael Rooker is still the best film version of Castle Rock's sheriff Alan Pangborn as well. And while there are some chills here and there, for some reason ""The Dark Half"" doesn't live up to its horror pedigree. At times I found the film dragged, the pacing seemed off, and scenes that were supposed to provide suspense seemed tedious instead.Still, this is a decent King adaptation, much better than quite a few filmed versions of his work, but it's not one of the best either.

146370,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,0792841328,General Zombie,"[2, 6]","'The Dark Half' is one of the many King adaptations that no one ever seems to talk about.  I suppose this makes sense, as it isn't one of the few genuinely excellent ones, nor is it one of the many terrible ones.  Of the middle of the pack films, however, it is one of the better ones, and it's definitely an effective waste of two hours, if not really much beyond that.Alright, the basic premise is that high-brow novelist Tad Beaumont earns most of his money off of lurid, pulpy crime novels, written under the pseudonym George Stark.  A reader learns this fact and blackmails Beaumont, because his reputation would be marred if it were revealed that he wrote mainstream pablum.  Rather than pay up, however, Tad decides to preemptively reveal the secret, and they have a chintzy fake funeral for George Stark.  Turns out that George wasn't quite ready to be buried, and he comes to life and goes on a killing spree.  This premise is fairly devisive, as people tend to either think this is a really intriging premise, or a really silly one.  Personally, I have no strong feelings either way.  It's accceptable enough.Technically this film is adept, if not terribly flashy most of the time.  The one main exception is one particular stalk/slash scene shown with alternating bursts of red and blue light, reminiscent of some Italian horror films, and his own earlier 'Creepshow'.  This is fairly effective, though it is a bit jarring as this sorta thing isn't used much in the film.  There's also a fairly creepy dream sequence, though it's perhaps a bit cliched. Finally, there is also some nice, mencacing outdoor scenery and strangely ominous flocks of birds, but as a whole this film is fairly straight forward from a visual standpoint.  Again, the acting is adept, if generally not remarkable.  Hutton plays both Stark and Beaumont, and he does a good job with both of them, particularly Stark.  Lots of people think Beaumont is too bland, but I think he's likable enough.  Stark is played more or less as a sorta slasher anti-hero, but he's more distinctive and clever than most of them.  He's kinda oddly characterized as a southern, country man and a black leather 50's greaser type simulataneously.  Unlike many of these sorts of characters, Stark manages to both be kinda over the top and humorous, while still being genuinely menacing and cruel.  The only other particularly notable performance is Rooker as the cop in charge of investigating the crimes.  This is most interesting cause Rooker is best known as Henry from the infamous 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer'.  Again, his performance isn't truly remarkable, but he's convincing enough and provides a good break from the stereotypical, middle-aged and mustachioed sheriff which typically populates this sorta film.'The Dark Half' is probably a bit overlong at 122 minutes, and the film loses some momentum in the second half, spending too much time between the bulk of the Stark murders, and the final confrontation between the Stark and Beaumont.  Many have criticized the odd finale, and while it isn't exactly great, it's not particularly unfortunate either, and it's got some amusing, over the top gore.  As a whole, the film isn't actually gory, though the murders are generally fairly painful and nasty. (Stark generally uses a straight razor, which has always struck me as a particularly unpleasant weapon, for some reason.)Geeze, I just don't have anything to say, I guess.

146374,A32IDF7JFAPXAG,0792841328,"Joshua Glowzinski ""Gman""","[0, 4]","This movie really only has one main cast member.  He is Timothy Hutton.  He has been in  many films.  A couple you may remember are Taps 1981 and French Kiss 1995.  He is also in several films coming up 2008-09.  Two are completed and five are still being produced.  He actually plays two roles in the film.  But I don't want to get ahead of myself, nor do I want to give away to much.  Below I will tell you a little about the movie without ruining it for everyone.This movie has a real mid - late 80's/ early 90s feel to it.  It is set in Main.  This only adds to the small town spooky feel.  The movie is about a man who as a young boy likes to write.  One day he is heading out to the bus when he passes out and is having seizures on the ground.  Turns out he has something wrong in his brain.  The doctors say it is something that must be removed.  While doing this they find something that shocks them all.  I don't want to ruin it so I will not say what.  So they remove it and it says like 18 years later.The man has become a writer.  He made up a name and face for his writing though.  He writes dirty stuff and does not want anyone to know.  A man finds out who he is and threatens to let every know unless he gives him money.  He tells him that he will call and let him know how much.  The writer decides to come out and tell everyone thus allowing him to feel free and not have to pay.  Well murders start to happen and the mans friend (who is the sheriff) thinks he has something to do with it.  Also, his prints were found on stuff at the crime scene.  I will not say anymore because I do not want to give anything away.  Trust me though.... It gets weird.The only problem I had with this movie was it kind of dragged on.  It was about 2 hours.  SO much could have been taken out to make it like an hour and forty minutes.  You find out what is happening pretty fast and from then on it's just repeat, repeat, repeat.  It will get old rather quickly.  It is a neat movie that has some strange horror/sci-fi feel to it.  I was at the movie store and I saw it sitting there.  I had never seen it before so I decided to rent.  I would say this was definitely more a rental than a buy.  Go read the book if you want instead of seeing the movie first.  Then watch the film and see what is different.  I will probably never watch this again though.  It just kind of hung there.  Kind of telling you what would happen and kind of not.  I guess it's like most books made into movie.  There always just ok.  Except Harry Potter.  All though I finished the last book the day before I saw the movie and the movie was SO much worse than the book.  It left out a lot of things that at the time I was reading seemed important.  Not sure if this film did that or not but see the movie as well as read the book and you can decide.",3,A movie based on a book by Steven King... there's something new.,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,2828,"['movie', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'main', 'cast', 'member', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'been', 'many', 'films', 'couple', 'may', 'remember', 'are', 'Taps', '1981', 'French', 'Kiss', '1995', 'also', 'several', 'films', 'coming', 'up', '2008-09', 'Two', 'are', 'completed', 'five', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'produced', 'actually', 'two', 'roles', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'ahead', 'do', 'want', 'give', 'away', 'much', 'will', 'tell', 'little', 'movie', 'ruining', 'everyone.This', 'movie', 'real', 'mid', 'late', ""80's/"", 'early', '90s', 'feel', 'set', 'Main', 'only', 'small', 'town', 'spooky', 'feel', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'young', 'boy', 'likes', 'write', 'One', 'day', 'heading', 'bus', 'when', 'out', 'having', 'seizures', 'ground', 'out', 'something', 'wrong', 'brain', 'doctors', 'say', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'removed', 'doing', 'find', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'what', 'So', 'remove', '18', 'years', 'later.The', 'man', 'become', 'writer', 'made', 'up', 'name', 'face', 'writing', 'dirty', 'stuff', 'not', 'want', 'anyone', 'know', 'man', 'out', 'who', 'let', 'know', 'money', 'will', 'call', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'writer', 'come', 'out', 'tell', 'everyone', 'thus', 'allowing', 'feel', 'free', 'not', 'have', 'pay', 'Well', 'murders', 'start', 'happen', 'mans', 'friend', 'who', 'sheriff', 'something', 'do', 'Also', 'prints', 'were', 'found', 'stuff', 'crime', 'scene', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'anymore', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'Trust', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'kind', 'dragged', 'was', 'about', '2', 'hours', 'SO', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'out', 'make', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'pretty', 'fast', 'then', 'just', 'repeat', 'repeat', 'repeat', 'will', 'get', 'old', 'rather', 'quickly', 'neat', 'movie', 'strange', 'horror/sci-fi', 'feel', 'was', 'movie', 'store', 'saw', 'sitting', 'there', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'decided', 'rent', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'definitely', 'more', 'rental', 'buy', 'Go', 'read', 'book', 'want', 'instead', 'seeing', 'movie', 'first', 'Then', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'different', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'kind', 'hung', 'there', 'Kind', 'telling', 'would', 'happen', 'kind', 'not', 'guess', 'most', 'books', 'made', 'movie', 'always', 'just', 'ok', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'finished', 'last', 'book', 'day', 'saw', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'SO', 'much', 'worse', 'book', 'left', 'out', 'lot', 'things', 'time', 'was', 'reading', 'seemed', 'important', 'Not', 'sure', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'decide']",N/A

Soon enough, he's literally struggling with himself while trying to protect his family, all concluding in one of the most memorable endings you'll ever see in a big screen King adaptation.  While it may be longer than it had to have been, Romero successfully weaves a film that does King's work justice while also putting a bit of his own spin on it at the same time.  The gore and makeup effects are very well done as well, and the cast, which also includes Amy Madigan, Michael Rooker, Julie Harris, and Robert Joy (who would be in Romero's Land of the Dead a little over a decade later) also take memorable turns, but it's Hutton who shines above the rest in one of the best performances of his entire career.

Unfortunately I can't say that it is,  although the film is somewhat true to the book.  However, what comes across  as eerie, creepy, or cool in the book comes across as silly and corny for  much of the movie.  The surgery scene, for example, where  &quot;George&quot; is incised from Thad's head is hilarious if you haven't  read the book, what with the eyeball staring out, almost as if it's saying  &quot;Feed Me&quot;!  In the book it was pretty darn scary.  Performance  wise, Timothy Hutton is right on, either as Thad Beaumont or George Stark.  and the story is, like I said, pretty true to the book.  But even the  presence of the sparrows is laughable, again, if you haven't read the book.  Now when I saw this I did have flashbacks to the actual reading of the  book, and there were some genuine chills.  But the book slays the movie any  old day.  Bottom line, if you're a serious Stephen King fan and you have to  have everything with his name on it, go ahead and buy this movie.  Or if  you loved the book and want the film adaptation buy it as well.  But if  you're an occasional Stephen King fan or if you haven't read the book  first, stay the hell away from this movie.  I have to give George Romero  credit for sticking with key elements of the book in his script, and some  pretty good direction.

When a little weasle from out of town threatens to blackmail Beaumont and blow his cover, he decides to let the world know that there is no George Stark and that he has been writing the best-selling books all along.  But, what if there really is a George Stark?  And what if George Stark wasn't totally real, but a part of Thad that was cut away a long time ago? And what if that George Stark came to life and starting killing people like the characters in his books do?  That pretty much sums up the plot of THE DARK HALF.  The movie ends in a climatic battle of the wills between Thad and George.The film contains some pretty decent acting, especially by Timothy Hutton who plays both Beumont and Stark.  The directing is done by horror master George Romero and is almost faultless. Nevertheless, more so because of a lackluster script than anything else, the movie never reaches it's full potential. The movie has a great premise, an interesting plot, and begins as an enthralling thriller. However, about a third of the way through, things start to loosen up and fall apart. The mood changes and instead of an enthralling thriller, the movie feels more like a semi-suspenseful dark comedy.  In the last act, the movie picks up steam again, but not enough to overcome the shortcomings of the second act.
