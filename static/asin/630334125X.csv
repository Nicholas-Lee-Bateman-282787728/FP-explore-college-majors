Both movies featured lots of scenery from Death Valley and surrounding areas. While ""Wavelength"" emphasized Panamint Valley, ""Six-String Samurai"" contained many scenes that were filmed in Searles Valley. Both valleys are near Death Valley. Another interesting coincidence is that both movies feature somewhat unusual soundtracks. The soundtrack for ""Wavelength"" was created by Tangerine Dream and ""Six-String Samurai"" featured lots of surf guitar songs. I'll admit that I wasn't crazy about either soundtrack, but atleast they weren't normal, boring, typical soundtracks either. Both movies were a little quirky and both seemed to have low budgets, or atleast not the greatest production quality. On the otherhand, both movies were interesting to watch and somewhat enjoyable, but I'm not sure if I would have found them so interesting if I wasn't preoccupied with identifying the locations where various scenes were shot. So, if you enjoy interesting desert scenery, I'd recommend both movies. The last third of ""Wavelength"" featured lots of scenes shot in Panamint Valley and the other movie had nice shots of the Trona Pinnacles. From a plot and character perspective, I'd say that ""Wavelength"" was the better of the two movies although the first two-thirds of the movie was a little tedious (they should have gotten to the desert a little sooner in the movie).",3,Death Valley Scenery,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,1460,"['Coincidentally', 'rented', 'Wavelength', 'purchased', 'Six-String', 'Samurai', 'same', 'week', 'movies', 'featured', 'lots', 'scenery', 'Death', 'Valley', 'surrounding', 'areas', 'Wavelength', 'emphasized', 'Panamint', 'Valley', 'Six-String', 'Samurai', 'contained', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'Searles', 'Valley', 'valleys', 'are', 'Death', 'Valley', 'interesting', 'coincidence', 'movies', 'feature', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'soundtracks', 'soundtrack', 'Wavelength', 'was', 'created', 'Tangerine', 'Dream', 'Six-String', 'Samurai', 'featured', 'lots', 'surf', 'guitar', 'songs', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'soundtrack', 'were', ""n't"", 'normal', 'boring', 'typical', 'soundtracks', 'either', 'movies', 'were', 'little', 'quirky', 'seemed', 'have', 'low', 'budgets', 'atleast', 'not', 'greatest', 'production', 'quality', 'otherhand', 'movies', 'were', 'interesting', 'watch', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'so', 'interesting', 'was', ""n't"", 'preoccupied', 'identifying', 'locations', 'where', 'various', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'So', 'enjoy', 'interesting', 'desert', 'scenery', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movies', 'last', 'third', 'Wavelength', 'featured', 'lots', 'scenes', 'shot', 'Panamint', 'Valley', 'other', 'movie', 'had', 'nice', 'shots', 'Trona', 'Pinnacles', 'plot', 'character', 'perspective', ""'d"", 'say', 'Wavelength', 'was', 'better', 'two', 'movies', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'tedious', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'desert', 'little', 'sooner', 'movie']",Wavelength VHS

Which made me feel great because I had felt the price was far too high for a VHS tape in good condition no matter how rare. Vendor was great: packaged the product well to protect it and delivered in a prompt time frame. Neat movie with a familiar face and a couple I hadn't seen before. The premise is great but, there aren't too many special effects and the aliens were a little disappointing in their humanness. The sets are pretty good and so is the acting but, the story itself is what matters here. Yes, there are underground facilities where the US military industrial complex has black programs to study aliens, thier technology and to use both to our advantage. Of course there's much more to it so, check out this cool fictionalized UFO crash retrieval flick.",4,"Rare find, great vendor",1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,911,"['took', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'finally', 'run', 'video', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'good', 'condition', 'feel', 'was', 'excellent', 'condition', 'Which', 'made', 'feel', 'great', 'had', 'felt', 'price', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'high', 'VHS', 'tape', 'good', 'condition', 'matter', 'how', 'rare', 'Vendor', 'was', 'great', 'packaged', 'product', 'well', 'protect', 'delivered', 'prompt', 'time', 'frame', 'Neat', 'movie', 'familiar', 'face', 'couple', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'premise', 'great', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'aliens', 'were', 'little', 'disappointing', 'humanness', 'sets', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'so', 'acting', 'story', 'what', 'here', 'Yes', 'are', 'underground', 'facilities', 'where', 'US', 'military', 'industrial', 'complex', 'black', 'programs', 'study', 'aliens', 'thier', 'technology', 'use', 'advantage', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'cool', 'fictionalized', 'UFO', 'crash', 'retrieval', 'flick']",Wavelength VHS
