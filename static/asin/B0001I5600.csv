All Disney did was to transfer The  little Mermaids Saturday morning cartoon from the Disney Channel onto the dvd and they did the same thing with the Jasmine story too.They did a cut and paste of pictures for the ""Cinderella Story and the Belle story-which is not even a cartoon but more of a read along with the pictures. There are supposed to be 4 stories but actually there are only 2 animated stories.My girls do like it, but I could have just taped it on a vcr tape and saved myself the trouble and money. There is a craft on making a bracelet-but we could have done without that too. The new song by the Disney Princesses is great to listen to, but the video is also another one of Disney cutting up scenes from all the princess movies and pasting them all together to make the video. I would not recommend buying this dvd or vhs. You think that Disney would have done something new with the Disney Princesses...guess it is all about the money. Can you see the BIG ""SUCKER"" sign stamped on my forehead???? Well.... I would do (just about) anything for my 2 little princessess- except buy another Disney Princess movie unless it is a new princess they come up with.",2,Could have been better,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,1479,"['am', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'Disney-they', 'advertised', 'one', 'longest', 'time', 'girls', 'were', 'soooo', 'psyched', 'get', 'it-I', 'was', 'going', 'wait', 'till', 'Christmas', 'had', '10.00', 'off', 'when', 'spend', '10.00', 'coupon-thank', 'god', 'had', 'coupon', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'upset', 'spend', 'money', 'Disney', 'did', 'was', 'transfer', 'little', 'Mermaids', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'dvd', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'Jasmine', 'story', 'too.They', 'did', 'cut', 'paste', 'pictures', 'Cinderella', 'Story', 'Belle', 'story-which', 'not', 'even', 'cartoon', 'more', 'read', 'pictures', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', '4', 'stories', 'actually', 'are', 'only', '2', 'animated', 'stories.My', 'girls', 'do', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'taped', 'vcr', 'tape', 'saved', 'trouble', 'money', 'craft', 'making', 'bracelet-but', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'too', 'new', 'song', 'Disney', 'Princesses', 'great', 'listen', 'video', 'also', 'one', 'Disney', 'cutting', 'up', 'scenes', 'princess', 'movies', 'pasting', 'together', 'make', 'video', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'buying', 'dvd', 'vhs', 'think', 'Disney', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'new', 'Disney', 'Princesses', 'guess', 'money', 'Can', 'see', 'BIG', 'SUCKER', 'sign', 'stamped', 'forehead', 'Well', 'would', 'do', 'just', 'about', 'anything', '2', 'little', 'princessess-', 'buy', 'Disney', 'Princess', 'movie', 'new', 'princess', 'come', 'up']",N/A

Each uses a combination of repurposed animation and new art to try to muddle through a short story. Not to put too fine a point on it - it's for kids after all - but the stories are all confusing, and completely out of character for each character. This makes it difficult for kids to digest easily, and you have to spend time narrating why Jasmine did this, or what's happening with Belle, and you end up trying to help this whole disaster limp along to a quick end.The art is terrible also, and the only reason this matters is that it's an official Disney product. All this would be excusable if it were in the 2.99 bin at the supermarket, but this is the lowest, most crass grab for consumer dollars by Disney that I've ever seen.Don't fall for it - even Return of Jafar looks like a classic next to this.

Gunderson ""gundy""","[3, 4]","Okay, so maybe this isn't a 5-star production but it DEFINITELY doesn't deserve all the 1- and even 2-star ratings that are on here and many reviews aren't even accurate descriptions of the product. Apparently people were expecting some big budget production on par with Disney's big screen counterparts and that's not the case, nor was it intended that way. This is a THEME DVD intended for CHILDREN focused on what makes a gift special and I feel it accomplishes this task. Many of those posting the negative reviews even admit that their children enjoy the stories. I also don't understand all the harsh comments regarding the quality. Some have pointed out that the two fully-animated stories are from TV shows and that's the kind of quality you get which isn't terrible. Disney has been reissuing TV episodes on DVD for years and still does. Again, this DVD features stories focused on a central theme targeted to elementary-aged children.The first ""chapter"" is fully animated which features Ariel and her desire to dance like a human. She teams up with another mermaid (who can't speak but wants to sing) on a quest to find the wishing starfish to grant their wishes (think Wizard of Oz). In the end, they discover that they should be thankful for the gifts that they do have. There is one part with some scary crabs that might be frightening for younger children.The second episode is short and features Belle in a SEMI-ANIMATED read-along story book format that stresses the importance of giving to others and how good it can make you feel in return. Though the story does move along at a ""regular"" pace, I would think the fact that the words appear on the screen and are highlighted as they are spoken could provide an additional benefit to kids learning to read.The third story is is similar to the second as it is another short SEMI-ANIMATED read-along story book feature with Cinderella trying to find a birthday gift for the king and discovers that a ""gift from the heart"" is often more precious than anything that money can buy.The final story is another fully animated feature with Jasmine and the rest of the gang attempting to cheer up a bratty unhappy boy king who's mood determines the state of his kingdom. They soon get the boy king to discover how enjoyable it can be to make others happy and thus restore the stability of the land. I found this episode to be the most enjoyable from an adult standpoint and is quite humorous in parts.Some may even find the bonus features ""useful"" which are described elsewhere in these reviews.Bottom line, not a bad video for helping teach our children the importance of giving of oneself to others.",5,Not THAT bad...,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,2657,"['Okay', 'so', 'maybe', ""n't"", '5-star', 'production', 'DEFINITELY', ""n't"", 'deserve', '1-', 'even', '2-star', 'ratings', 'are', 'here', 'many', 'reviews', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'accurate', 'descriptions', 'product', 'Apparently', 'people', 'were', 'expecting', 'big', 'budget', 'production', 'par', 'Disney', 'big', 'screen', 'counterparts', 'not', 'case', 'was', 'intended', 'way', 'THEME', 'DVD', 'intended', 'CHILDREN', 'focused', 'what', 'gift', 'special', 'feel', 'task', 'Many', 'posting', 'negative', 'reviews', 'even', 'admit', 'children', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'harsh', 'comments', 'regarding', 'quality', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'two', 'fully-animated', 'stories', 'are', 'TV', 'shows', 'kind', 'quality', 'get', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'Disney', 'been', 'reissuing', 'TV', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'years', 'still', 'Again', 'DVD', 'stories', 'focused', 'central', 'theme', 'targeted', 'elementary-aged', 'children.The', 'first', 'chapter', 'fully', 'animated', 'Ariel', 'desire', 'dance', 'human', 'teams', 'up', 'mermaid', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'sing', 'quest', 'find', 'wishing', 'starfish', 'grant', 'wishes', 'think', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'end', 'discover', 'should', 'be', 'thankful', 'gifts', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'part', 'scary', 'crabs', 'might', 'be', 'frightening', 'younger', 'children.The', 'second', 'episode', 'short', 'features', 'Belle', 'SEMI-ANIMATED', 'read-along', 'story', 'book', 'format', 'importance', 'giving', 'others', 'how', 'good', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'return', 'story', 'move', 'along', 'regular', 'pace', 'would', 'think', 'fact', 'words', 'appear', 'screen', 'are', 'highlighted', 'are', 'spoken', 'could', 'provide', 'additional', 'benefit', 'kids', 'learning', 'read.The', 'third', 'story', 'similar', 'second', 'short', 'SEMI-ANIMATED', 'read-along', 'story', 'book', 'feature', 'Cinderella', 'trying', 'find', 'birthday', 'gift', 'king', 'discovers', 'gift', 'heart', 'often', 'more', 'precious', 'anything', 'money', 'can', 'buy.The', 'final', 'story', 'fully', 'animated', 'feature', 'Jasmine', 'rest', 'gang', 'attempting', 'cheer', 'up', 'bratty', 'unhappy', 'boy', 'king', 'who', 'mood', 'state', 'kingdom', 'soon', 'get', 'boy', 'king', 'discover', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'can', 'be', 'make', 'others', 'happy', 'thus', 'restore', 'stability', 'land', 'found', 'episode', 'be', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'adult', 'standpoint', 'quite', 'humorous', 'parts.Some', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'bonus', 'useful', 'are', 'described', 'elsewhere', 'reviews.Bottom', 'line', 'not', 'bad', 'video', 'helping', 'teach', 'children', 'importance', 'giving', 'others']",N/A
