835756,A2ZS8TWUL1QTRH,B0002IQHK2,A.J. Dill,"[3, 11]","I had high hopes for Requiem of Darkness since it had a dark atmosphere to it. Also, the characters looked very unique and intriguing. Unfortunatley, the beginning is very rough, both in content and speed of the show.The plot is about a writer who wants to create a book of horror stories. He is always interested in cursed places and people with bad omens hanging over their head. He meets up with a gang of three people with dark powers who murder the murderers, and immediately becomes their intrusive groopy.Unfortunately, the show is not as slick as the plot sounds. The first episode immediately starts off with the story-telling. It is centered upon a man who murdered a talented child for he was jealous. Throughout the episode, you see the man going insane with guilt and hearing strange noises. The problem is nothing interesting is revealed about any of the main characters and some of the events feel rushed and confusing without the nice introductions of who's who.The second episode I found more enjoyable since it was unique. It is about a man with a hotel protected by the willow woman. The willow womanis infatuated with the owner and killed all of his wives and children. It even has a little plot twist, nothing extrodinary but still welcoming.And once again, the third and fourth episodes deal with insane murders. This is when the show became boring for me. I do find crazy murders interesting to read and watch about, but I like to have more variety if this is what the who show is going to be about. Also, the show's trick of using violence and paranoia to be scary lost its buzz by the end of the DVD.I give it an extra star since one episode is decent and the character design is great. Unfortunately, the show left me unsatisfied since the main people of the show weren't the main focus of these first few episodes. Maybe the next few volumes will be more creative and give more details on the main plot, but I personally don't care to spend anymore of my money on such a risk.One last note: this show has very intense adult content. Don't make the assumption that the rating is over exxagerated for it definitely is not. Actually, I personally thought the rating was too low for this show.",2,Needs even more Creativity,1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,2216,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Requiem', 'Darkness', 'had', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'Also', 'characters', 'looked', 'very', 'unique', 'intriguing', 'Unfortunatley', 'beginning', 'very', 'rough', 'content', 'speed', 'show.The', 'plot', 'writer', 'who', 'create', 'book', 'horror', 'stories', 'always', 'interested', 'cursed', 'places', 'people', 'bad', 'omens', 'hanging', 'head', 'up', 'gang', 'three', 'people', 'dark', 'powers', 'who', 'murder', 'murderers', 'immediately', 'becomes', 'intrusive', 'groopy.Unfortunately', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'slick', 'plot', 'first', 'episode', 'immediately', 'story-telling', 'centered', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'talented', 'child', 'was', 'jealous', 'episode', 'see', 'man', 'going', 'insane', 'guilt', 'hearing', 'strange', 'noises', 'problem', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'revealed', 'main', 'characters', 'events', 'feel', 'rushed', 'confusing', 'nice', 'introductions', 'who', 'who.The', 'second', 'episode', 'found', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'unique', 'man', 'hotel', 'protected', 'willow', 'woman', 'willow', 'womanis', 'infatuated', 'owner', 'killed', 'wives', 'children', 'even', 'little', 'plot', 'twist', 'nothing', 'extrodinary', 'still', 'once', 'again', 'third', 'fourth', 'episodes', 'deal', 'insane', 'murders', 'when', 'show', 'became', 'boring', 'do', 'find', 'crazy', 'murders', 'interesting', 'read', 'watch', 'like', 'have', 'more', 'variety', 'what', 'who', 'show', 'going', 'be', 'about', 'Also', 'show', 'trick', 'using', 'violence', 'paranoia', 'be', 'scary', 'lost', 'buzz', 'end', 'DVD.I', 'give', 'extra', 'star', 'one', 'episode', 'decent', 'character', 'design', 'great', 'Unfortunately', 'show', 'left', 'unsatisfied', 'main', 'people', 'show', 'were', ""n't"", 'main', 'focus', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Maybe', 'next', 'few', 'volumes', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'creative', 'give', 'more', 'details', 'main', 'plot', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'spend', 'anymore', 'money', 'risk.One', 'last', 'note', 'show', 'very', 'intense', 'adult', 'content', 'Do', ""n't"", 'make', 'assumption', 'rating', 'over', 'exxagerated', 'definitely', 'not', 'Actually', 'personally', 'thought', 'rating', 'was', 'too', 'low', 'show']",N/A
835757,AM9YB0BKXFH7Z,B0002IQHK2,"B. Ackley ""jumpstudios""","[17, 19]","I was really surprised by how much I loved Geneon's ""requiem from the Darkness."" The short 13 episode anime series really is a breath of fresh air in a genre crwoded with Hulking mecha, predictable harem shows and over-the-top comedy. The series is visually a huge treat. The characters still are anime style but they have a slightly angular/ almost punk comic style to them. The backgrounds are very stylized and feature a amazing combination of art styles and CG work.The story itself is a simple tale of young Momosuke attempting to collect local ghost stories for his book ""100 stories."" Along his way he encounters 3 strangers whose job it is to punish wrong-doers with a fate best befitting their crime. Rather than collect ghost stories Momosuke gets caught up in them and bears witness to some of the darker aspects of life in Edo-Era Japan.The show is violent and features some scary sequences and mature themes but isnt gratuitous in its depictions. Overall the mood is suspenseful with bits of comedy and drama here and there. I recommend the regular verion of this series as oppossed to the boxset. The Boxset has cheap plastic holders (think CD flip book holders) for all 4 DVDs but not the cover art. The boxset is pointless unless you are okay with keeping JUST the DVDs from volumes 2-4 and throwing away the cases and cover art. AT half the price plus with a case to match vols 2-4, the regular version is the way to go.If you are looking for some beautiful and offbeat anime with a plot this is an EXCELLENT place to start.

835758,ALT1SS5DTTKG6,B0002IQHK2,"errorfound482 ""errorfound482""","[8, 9]","I've only watched the first volume which seems to be building up to something, rising to the climax, so I can't give a judgement about the entire series, but...Everyone's right - this is not your typical anime.  If you're looking for animation style, you might be disappointed - it's definitely stylish, with creative ways to use still images (it's not a slideshow... but there's less movement than you would expect).  The opening is weird (as in odd), but...If you're into Japanese Ghost Stories, this is definitely the anime for you.  Japansese Ghost Stories have always been told differently than Western Ghost Stories (such as the classic live action KWAIDAN).  You can see the roots of tale-spinning which would later evolve to the likes of modern classics like THE RING.The whole premise is that a writer is seeking ghost tales in order to compile it in a book called ""100 Stories"", but finds himself encountering actual ghosts while finding a trio of supernatural agents seeking to eliminate these ghosts.  Every episode is introduces a new Japanese ghost story.It's definitely grisly and mysterious with alot of background on Japanese culture.  So far the story seems kinda' slow (it's not action-packed) which is also typical of Japanese Ghost stories, but it seems building up to something which I can't wait to find out what.  It's quirky though, and I would recommend a rental before buying.",4,Anime - the Kwaidan (Japanese Ghost story) way,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,1403,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'first', 'volume', 'be', 'building', 'up', 'something', 'rising', 'climax', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'judgement', 'entire', 'series', 'Everyone', 'right', 'not', 'typical', 'anime', ""'re"", 'looking', 'animation', 'style', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'definitely', 'stylish', 'creative', 'ways', 'use', 'still', 'images', 'not', 'slideshow', 'less', 'movement', 'would', 'expect', 'opening', 'weird', 'odd', ""'re"", 'Japanese', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'definitely', 'anime', 'Japansese', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'told', 'differently', 'Western', 'Ghost', 'Stories', 'such', 'classic', 'live', 'action', 'KWAIDAN', 'can', 'see', 'roots', 'tale-spinning', 'would', 'later', 'evolve', 'likes', 'modern', 'classics', 'THE', 'RING.The', 'whole', 'premise', 'writer', 'seeking', 'ghost', 'tales', 'order', 'compile', 'book', 'called', '100', 'Stories', 'encountering', 'actual', 'ghosts', 'finding', 'trio', 'supernatural', 'agents', 'seeking', 'eliminate', 'ghosts', 'episode', 'new', 'Japanese', 'ghost', 'story.It', 'definitely', 'grisly', 'mysterious', 'alot', 'background', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'So', 'far', 'story', 'kinda', 'slow', 'not', 'action-packed', 'also', 'typical', 'Japanese', 'Ghost', 'stories', 'building', 'up', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'quirky', 'would', 'recommend', 'rental', 'buying']",N/A

To my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime. This show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people. The strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing. Also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered. This show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each/husband killing wife after wife/a man who enjoys murder/and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other. I recommend this show to no one and I believe Geneon has made a mistake licensing it. If you don't heed my review then you have wasted your money on a DVD not worth a penny (I wouldn't take it for free).,1,Such a disgusting anime,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,943,"['When', '1st', 'watched', 'Requiem', 'Darkness', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'anime', 'show', 'heard', 'could', 'actually', 'scary', 'dissappointment', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'scary', 'mockery', 'anything', 'anime', 'show', 'good', 'animation', 'spots', 'deformed', 'shapes', 'people', 'strengths', 'show', 'however', 'primarily', 'rely', 'soundtrack', 'above', 'average', 'nothing', 'amazing', 'Also', 'last', 'straw', 'show', 'was', 'horrible', 'depictions', 'people', 'being', 'graphically', 'murdered', 'show', 'disgusting', 'potrayals', 'brothers', 'murdering', 'each/husband', 'killing', 'wife', 'wife/a', 'man', 'who', 'murder/and', 'very', 'very', 'intense', 'sexual', 'situations', 'insects', 'once', 'again', 'family', 'members', 'murdering', 'other', 'recommend', 'show', 'one', 'believe', 'Geneon', 'made', 'mistake', 'licensing', 'do', ""n't"", 'heed', 'review', 'then', 'have', 'wasted', 'money', 'DVD', 'not', 'penny', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'free']",N/A
