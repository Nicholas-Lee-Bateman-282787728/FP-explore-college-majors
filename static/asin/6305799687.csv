478383,A24PTVSZSM8968,6305799687,Amazon Customer,"[3, 4]","This movie has a lot to recommend it. Unfortunately, it misses in a couple of big ways. At the beginning of the movie, we meet a struggling writer who lives alone. Out of the blue, a woman appears at his door. It is his former girlfriend who announces that she needs to drop off her daughter for two weeks while she goes on a business trip. At first, the guy doesn't know what to do, but he and the girl quickly begin to bond. At the same time, the girl befriends a woman who lives nearby. The little girl turns out to be very precocious and wise for her age and is the catalyst for a romantic meeting between the two adults as well as the unexpected success of the guy she is staying with. Eventually, the guy discovers that the little girl is actually his daughter. The end of the movie involves a custody battle but ends up happily, at least for the girl and her father. Unfortunately, while the whole middle of the movie involves a lot of cute scenes with a lot of chemistry between the little girl and her father, the beginning and end of the movie are bit too creepy for my taste, at least in a movie of this type. It is uncomfortable to see a woman drop off her daughter with a complete stranger in the beginning and it is equally uncomfortable to see the custody battle at the end. The viewer is rooting for the father to win out, but there is no obvious reason to cheer for the mother to lose custody. For me, the story had a lot of potential, but the romantic aspects are obscured by other factors and the poor beginning and end prevent the story from reaching its full potential. The little girl turns out to be very charming and does a wonderful job with her part. This makes the movie worth watching. However, in the end, the experience is less satisfying than it could have been.",3,Near miss,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,1793,"['movie', 'lot', 'recommend', 'Unfortunately', 'couple', 'big', 'ways', 'beginning', 'movie', 'meet', 'struggling', 'writer', 'who', 'alone', 'blue', 'woman', 'door', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'drop', 'off', 'daughter', 'two', 'weeks', 'business', 'trip', 'first', 'guy', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'girl', 'quickly', 'begin', 'bond', 'same', 'time', 'girl', 'woman', 'who', 'nearby', 'little', 'girl', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'precocious', 'wise', 'age', 'catalyst', 'romantic', 'meeting', 'two', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'unexpected', 'success', 'guy', 'staying', 'Eventually', 'guy', 'little', 'girl', 'actually', 'daughter', 'end', 'movie', 'custody', 'battle', 'up', 'happily', 'least', 'girl', 'father', 'Unfortunately', 'whole', 'middle', 'movie', 'lot', 'cute', 'scenes', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'little', 'girl', 'father', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'creepy', 'taste', 'least', 'movie', 'type', 'uncomfortable', 'see', 'woman', 'drop', 'daughter', 'complete', 'stranger', 'beginning', 'equally', 'uncomfortable', 'see', 'custody', 'battle', 'end', 'viewer', 'rooting', 'father', 'win', 'out', 'obvious', 'reason', 'cheer', 'mother', 'lose', 'custody', 'story', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'romantic', 'aspects', 'are', 'obscured', 'other', 'factors', 'poor', 'beginning', 'end', 'prevent', 'story', 'reaching', 'full', 'potential', 'little', 'girl', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'charming', 'wonderful', 'job', 'part', 'movie', 'watching', 'However', 'end', 'experience', 'less', 'satisfying', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Undercover Angel VHS

She's now a successful, busy lawyer who wants him to babysit her six-year-old daughter for two weeks.  At first awkward and at a loss, he is gradually warmed by the precocious little girl, who wrangles an introduction to a woman he's had his eye on, and gets him to tell her a bedtime story which she secretly records and sends to a publisher.  He comes to love the little girl and she him and both dread the day when the mother comes back.  But the biggest surprise of all comes when he discovers that the little girl is his daughter. Then, the mother returns.Fortunately, the moviemaker did not make the casting mistakes so often made in family movies recently.  The little girl is delightful and very appealing.  The girlfriend is not only pretty but appealing.  All look much, much better that their pictures on the DVD cover (but then, isn't that true for almost all DVD covers?).The character/casting of the man, the central character, is regrettable.  He is whiney throughout, even after his success.  This hurts the movie and may account for why this good movie is going off the market so soon.  His courtroom appearance even strains credibility: everyone knows to be decorous in a court appearance.The movie begins inappropriately with a scene from the mystery novel the man is trying to write.  This is unnecessary, misleading and inappropriate.

The story is too unbelievable.Forget the weird start of the movie, where you are to see a bit of the stuff a not-published writer put together.Six years old Jenny is brought by her mother to stay with her old boyfriend, that writer. She hides the fact that he is the child's father. So far so good. But then the character of this little girl is totally unbelievable. A six year old would never speak the way she speaks or act the way she acts, not even copied from the boring mother. Nine or ten would have been a little bit more realistic.But that such a young child would come up with the idea and be able to execute that idea that her father's bedtime story should be read by a publisher, find a stranger to type it for her, and that the publishing house would read it almost the day after they got it, instead of the months they let one wait normally, is just plain stupid. And then it is published amazingly quickly and so on.For those who do want to see this movie, I will not write down all the completely unrealistic moves this script makes, so not to spoil your 'fun'. But I will inform you that the emotions portrayed by the adult lead actors are like chicken soup without chicken. They either do not seem realistic or the actors are not able enough to live them out for us adequately. Even the love story is put together without much hindrance of psychological insight.The little child herself is already an amazing actress.

He's funny, playful, and tender. Everything you'd want for  a dad for your child. Yasmine Bleeth is good. James Earl Jones is good. The  story is sweet enough for kids, but not so bad as to make a grown up's  teeth rot out.But, and this is important, there are some *major* holes  in the movie. First off, you've got a too busy mom with a new beau who  doesn't like kids. So off she goes to Canada, leaving Jenny with a perfect  stranger (for Jenny at least). Who would do this?  Then, after Jenny falls  in love with Harrison, who she finds out is her real dad, mom comes back  and makes Jenny leave without even a hug from her father. Who is that  unfeeling?Harrison is told he needs money to fight for custody. He  becomes a published writer during the course of the movie. Once he has  money, he tries to win full custody of his daughter. Only, why didn't he  just move to Canada himself? A writer can write anywhere. Why go through a  trial and everything else when he simply could have moved to Canada. This  really bothered me because if he really loved his daughter, he'd have  moved.I did like this movie, though. The love story between father and  daughter was very nice and very believable. The growing romance between  Harrison and Holly was also sweet and believable. At first viewing, Jenny  seemed to be over acting quite a bit. With repeated viewings, though, her  acting seems to get &quot;better&quot;. I think she's over acting to seem  older, more grown up because mom's beau doesn't like kids.

478406,A4JHEO7H330AF,6305799687,Tom Brody,"[2, 2]","UNDERCOVER ANGEL is a story of a technical writer, who tries writing murder-mystery manuscripts on the side, and who receives delivery of a six year old girl. The girl, intelligent and articulate beyond her years, is quiet at first, and the writer is somewhat grumpy at first. The girl's mother, an attorney with dual U.S. and Canadian citizen ship, drops the six year old girl at the writer's apartment. At a cafe, the girl spontaneously acts as a match-maker between the technical writer and a secretary at the next table. The secretary has a dog, and she spends an hour at the out-of-door cafe every day or so. The viewer will be charmed by the words that are stuffed into the 6-year old's mouth by the screenwriter. For example, the girl refers to the secretary at the next table, and accuses the writer of ""drooling"" over the secretary. (Any viewer of this movie will agree that the actress playing the secretary is smokin' hot. Yasmine Bleeth plays the hottie.)  SPOILER ALERT:  IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HOW THE STORY TURNS OUT, THEN DO NOT READ THIS.  That said, it should be added that there is not any real ""surprising ending"" in this story.  This story is not like a TWILIGHT ZONE story, where most of the plot hinges on a ""surprise ending.""THE TAPE RECORDER. At any rate, the plot takes an unexpected and creative turn, when the 6-year old girl decides to activate a pocket tape recorder during her bedtime story. As part of the plot, the writer and the girl readily warm up to each other, and the writer embarks on the custom of telling bedtime stories to her. The girl manages to deliver the evening's story to the secretary, because the secretary has agreed to type the stories for eventual submission to a publisher. And so, things seem to be humming along in a charming and semi-predictable manner. A stuffed dodo bird accompanies each storytelling hour, and the stories are about the dodo bird. However, while the attorney mother is in Canada tending to business, she contacts her former boyfriend (the writer) and requests that he take care of some paperwork so that the 6-year old can get Canadian citizenship. While complying with this request, and while helping with the paperwork, the writer notices that HIS NAME IS ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE OF THE GIRL. This is the first that he learns, that he is the real father of the six year old girl. (All along, the girl continues to spew out intelligent and charming lines that are beyond her years.) At any rate, the trio continues to burn their candle at both ends, and they have fun together at a go cart course, and the next weekend, have fun at a miniature golf course.LOVE HAPPENS. At the 53 minute mark, the hot secretary and the writer are holding hands. The problem with this situation, is that the writer is one week away from being evicted for failure to pay rent, and the girl is one way from being retrieved by the lawyer mother, for a life in Canada. WHAT NEXT? At the 56 minute mark, the writer receives another rejection from another publisher. At the 57 minute mark, the trio is at a drive-in movie, watching a cartoon. The 6-year old sits in the back seat of writer's Volkswagon bug. At this point, the writer is still unaware that the girl is smuggling the tape recordings to the secretary. After the drive-in movie date, the writer gently lunges at the secretary's cheek to give her a peck. But the secretary justifiably get upset, because she also realizes that all three of them are burning the candle at both ends. WHAT NEXT? The writer does the logical thing, and consults the classified section of the newspaper, in search of a full-time job (his only source of income is writing manuals for household devices, e.g., pocket tape recorders and ball throwing machines.) At any rate, the writer's osculatory lunge did not scare the secretary away, and the next scene shows the secretary taking a walk with the girl.STORY TAKES A TRAGIC TWIST. The mother returns from Canada, a week prematurely, causing the 6-year old to have a meltdown because she is being dragged away from her real father (Harrison the writer). Well, well, that's what happens when you burn the candle at both ends. In the next scene, the writer puts his typewriter up for sale. He consults an international lawyer, in an attempt to get custody of the girl. ""Sometimes you do need money to buy happiness,"" says the lawyer, advising the writer. WHAT NEXT? The next scene shows the manuscript arriving at a publisher's office. ""Clara, get this Harrison-What's-His-Name"" on the horn, says the publisher, referring to the fact that he likes the story penned by the writer, and dictated and then submitted by the hot secretary. Apparently, this represents a turning point in the movie, but the next scene shows the writer's job application at a Toyota dealer being rejected. At the one hour and ten minute time point, the hot secretary ambles through the park and encounters the writer (Harrison), and they smooch on the park bench. Meanwhile, back to reality, Harrison and the hot secretary pack up Harrison's belongings into cardboard boxes, because of the eviction. WHAT NEXT?TURNING POINT. Finally, at the one hour and thirteen minute mark, the publisher calls Harrison, and informs him that his ""detective manuscript stinks"" that his book ""Terror By Night"" really sucks, but that his book on Mister Dodo is accepted for publication. Things get better. While the attorney mother and the 6-year old are in a book store in Canada, they encounter a display of the story about Mister Dodo. The display proclaims that Mister Dodo is a best seller. The next scene is a courtroom scene, for deciding custody. (Obviously, Harrison was able to afford the international attorney.) James Earl Jones plays the judge in the courtroom. James Earl Jones tells the girl that she is a ""cutie"" immediately after she delivers a letter to the judge, expressing her opinion. ""Thank you, my honor,"" replies the girl. (Again, this is a clever twist of language provided by the scriptwriter.) James Earl Jones rules that the 6-year old girl is to be given custody with her mother. And so, the real father (Harrison) and the 6-year old girl are shown to have a computer relationship, where they communicate by way of a computer device.HAPPY ENDING, SOB! SOB! The next scene takes place in the house of the lawyer mother, and we see Harrison on a television program being interviewed. The mother sees Harrison on the television, and she gets a bit upset. ""I am your mother and I have just told you to go to bed,"" she angrily proclaims. ""I am sick of Mister Dodo."" ""I hate you,"" screams the 6-year old. The mother then slaps the girl on her face. WHAT NEXT? The mother changes her mind, and decides to transfer custody to Harrison. ""I want Jenny to live with you, she needs a stable upbringing . . . I would be a better mother if I just gave her to you."" (Happy ending, sob, sob.) The next scene shows Harrison at a book signing party, with a display of a dozen Mister Dodo books on the table, and a line of hundreds of children waiting for the author's autograph. If you don't being manipulated and jerked around by a charming but simple story, then you might agree that the film deserves FIVE STARS.",5,"Contains elements of a typical romance story, but with a
