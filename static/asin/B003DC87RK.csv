1337140,A3ONXLUAUFP05L,B003DC87RK,Bondfu,"[0, 0]",I was interested to see what these NFL complete games discs look on blu ray. I was impressed. Nothing like watching Farve. If he had won that game and the Superbowl I wonder if they would even have brought up Bounty Gate at all. You can relive all the bone crunching moments and hard sideline hits that just light up this disc. I think football is a different game now and you will never see anything like this again.,5,great picture,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,417,"['was', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'NFL', 'complete', 'games', 'discs', 'look', 'blu', 'ray', 'was', 'impressed', 'Nothing', 'watching', 'Farve', 'had', 'won', 'game', 'Superbowl', 'wonder', 'would', 'even', 'have', 'brought', 'up', 'Bounty', 'Gate', 'can', 'relive', 'bone', 'crunching', 'moments', 'hard', 'sideline', 'just', 'light', 'up', 'disc', 'think', 'football', 'different', 'game', 'now', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'again']",N/A

I was a little disappointed that there are no player intros on the Super Bowl broadcast and no trophy presentation of any post-game.  It's literally the opening kick-off to the final gun and as cool as it is to have all that, so much of the fun of reliving these moments is the celebration.",5,So glad to have these memorable moments from a memorable season on Blu-ray.,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,374,"['Great', 'watch', 'games', 'again.The', 'NFC', 'Championship', 'alone', 'purchase', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'are', 'player', 'intros', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'broadcast', 'trophy', 'presentation', 'post-game', 'literally', 'opening', 'kick-off', 'final', 'gun', 'as', 'cool', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'reliving', 'moments', 'celebration']",N/A

1337144,ARHQDLVS64GR5,B003DC87RK,Matthew,"[3, 3]","For those Saints fans who wanted a nice DVD of the entire game of the Saints' Superbowl victory, this is it. It does have every play of the Superbowl game along with the three preceding games that led up to it. They are not highlight cuts of the games. I had to work during SB 44 and I later wanted to sit and watch the entire game, not a highlight reel. The only drawback to this dvd (hence the missing 5th star)is the editing job on the games. The first quarter of the SB 44 game went by extremely fast because the editors cut almost everything from when the ball was down on each play to the next snap of the ball. The other quarters are also edited, but just not quite as short between plays. Why they could not just put the entire broadcast with between play commentary and the players lining up is a question for the wise man on the hill along with the meaning of life. I felt like I was being rushed through the game, and found it a little less pleasurable to soak up our beloved Saints' victory. Any football fan, I believe, will find the between play editing a little disconcerting, and that it throws the flow of the game off. When the game is won don't expect much either because the dvd ends abruptly about a minute or so later. No interviews or trophy presentation. It would not have killed the NFL or warner video to include the entire game broadcast and after-game footage. This good dvd set would have been great except for the editing.",4,A Good DVD Set That Could Have Been Great,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,1452,"['Saints', 'fans', 'who', 'wanted', 'nice', 'DVD', 'entire', 'game', 'Saints', 'Superbowl', 'victory', 'have', 'play', 'Superbowl', 'game', 'three', 'preceding', 'games', 'led', 'up', 'are', 'not', 'highlight', 'cuts', 'games', 'had', 'work', 'SB', '44', 'later', 'wanted', 'sit', 'watch', 'entire', 'game', 'not', 'highlight', 'reel', 'only', 'drawback', 'dvd', 'hence', 'missing', '5th', 'star', 'editing', 'job', 'games', 'first', 'quarter', 'SB', '44', 'game', 'went', 'extremely', 'fast', 'editors', 'cut', 'almost', 'everything', 'when', 'ball', 'was', 'down', 'play', 'next', 'snap', 'ball', 'other', 'quarters', 'are', 'also', 'edited', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'short', 'plays', 'Why', 'could', 'not', 'just', 'put', 'entire', 'broadcast', 'play', 'commentary', 'players', 'lining', 'up', 'question', 'wise', 'man', 'hill', 'meaning', 'life', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'rushed', 'game', 'found', 'little', 'less', 'pleasurable', 'soak', 'up', 'beloved', 'Saints', 'victory', 'football', 'fan', 'believe', 'will', 'find', 'play', 'editing', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'flow', 'game', 'off', 'When', 'game', 'won', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'dvd', 'abruptly', 'minute', 'so', 'later', 'No', 'interviews', 'trophy', 'presentation', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'killed', 'NFL', 'warner', 'video', 'include', 'entire', 'game', 'broadcast', 'after-game', 'footage', 'good', 'dvd', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'editing']",N/A

We brought the wood!Disc 3: the overtime thriller against the tough Minnesota Vikings in the first NFC championship game played at the Superdome. ""Pigs have flown! Hell has frozen over!"" On to Miami!Last, and of course not least:Disc 4: Saints vs. Colts in Superbowl XLIV!!Coming in at 479 minutes, just under 8 hours of ultimate ecstasy for any member of the Who Dat Nation, this is an essential purchase for any member of the most long-suffering and loyal fan base in the NFL. Better than pinching yourself to see if it's still a dream, we get to watch the Saints snatch victory from the jaws of defeat against the Redskins, steamroll the Cardinals (and Kurt Warner into retirement), watch the Saints gut it out against a gutty, yet error-filled, Vikings team led by Brett Farve, who took a heckuva lot of hits in his annual retirement game du jour. And the piece de resistance: Taking on one of New Orleans' favorite sons, Peyton Manning, in a Super Bowl classic, a game filled with daredevil playcalling and one mistake being one too many for Manning, as the Saints upset the applecart on the way to Peyton being enthroned as the greatest QB of all time, thanks in large part to SB MVP, Saints QB Drew Brees, and the often maligned Saints defense.Well, don't just sit there watching this screen: order it now!",5,"Network Re-broadcasts of 4 Games, Including SB XLIV",1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,1727,"['Based', 'examination', 'back', 'box', 'convenient', 'zoom', 'feature', 'what', 'Saints', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'original', 'Network', 'rebroadcasts', 'four', 'Saints', 'games', 'starting', 'Disc', '1', 'week', '13', 'game', 'victory', 'squeaker', 'Washington', 'Redskins.Ah', 'then', 'really', 'good', 'Who', 'Dat', 'Nation', 'Disc', '2', 'divisional', 'playoff', 'victory', 'Arizona', 'Cardinals', 'brought', 'wood', '3', 'overtime', 'thriller', 'tough', 'Minnesota', 'Vikings', 'first', 'NFC', 'championship', 'game', 'played', 'Superdome', 'Pigs', 'have', 'flown', 'Hell', 'frozen', 'over', 'Miami', 'Last', 'course', 'not', 'least', 'Disc', '4', 'Saints', 'vs.', 'Colts', 'Superbowl', 'XLIV', 'Coming', '479', 'minutes', 'just', '8', 'hours', 'ultimate', 'ecstasy', 'member', 'Who', 'Dat', 'Nation', 'essential', 'purchase', 'member', 'most', 'long-suffering', 'loyal', 'fan', 'base', 'NFL', 'Better', 'pinching', 'see', 'still', 'dream', 'get', 'watch', 'Saints', 'snatch', 'victory', 'jaws', 'defeat', 'Redskins', 'steamroll', 'Cardinals', 'Kurt', 'Warner', 'retirement', 'watch', 'Saints', 'gut', 'out', 'gutty', 'yet', 'error-filled', 'Vikings', 'team', 'led', 'Brett', 'Farve', 'who', 'took', 'heckuva', 'lot', 'hits', 'annual', 'retirement', 'game', 'du', 'jour', 'piece', 'de', 'resistance', 'Taking', 'one', 'New', 'Orleans', 'favorite', 'sons', 'Peyton', 'Manning', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'classic', 'game', 'filled', 'daredevil', 'playcalling', 'one', 'mistake', 'being', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'Manning', 'Saints', 'upset', 'applecart', 'way', 'Peyton', 'being', 'enthroned', 'greatest', 'QB', 'time', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'SB', 'MVP', 'Saints', 'QB', 'Drew', 'Brees', 'often', 'maligned', 'Saints', 'defense.Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'watching', 'screen', 'order', 'now']",N/A
