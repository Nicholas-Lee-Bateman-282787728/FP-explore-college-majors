1289077,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B002TY78PU,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[6, 9]","Dorothy L. Sayers writes many non-fiction books however among her best fiction is the Lord Peter Wimsey series. I came to this series somewhat though the back door. My first taste was the BBC productions with Petherbridge as Lord Peter that can now be found on DVD. Therefore, I read all of Dorothy's books containing the relationship of Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. Now it is time to go through the whole series.Now I watch the one I missed in PBS. The first thing I notices was that Ian Carmichael talks much faster than Petherbridge. Moreover, all the people seem older. Of course, Peter was supposed to be older when he met Harriet.Clouds of WitnessLord Peter returns from Corsica. To find his older brother the Duke of Denver (David Langton) practically accused of murder. What is worse is his brother is not talking. Therefore, it is up to Peter to find out what happened and clear his brother.In the process, he puts his foot in it and practically gets all his relatives and friends accused. As with all Sayers' stories nothing is simple there are overlapping plots and foolish deeds, as if Peter cannot figure them out. On the side, we learn a little about English society and ballistics.They took the time to put just about everything relevant from the book in to this production. There were a few exceptions but not worth bothering about. The production is complete enough that you do not have to read the book.------------------------------------------------------------The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club""Waiter take away Lord what's-his name""""He's been dead for two days...""We are introduced to the Bellona club were young Captain George Fentiman (John Quentin) and Lord Peter Wimsey (Ian Carmichael) two war survivors are talking a little too loud about General Fentiman (Ralph Truman), Georges grandfather. General Fentiman is not responding and for good reason he is dead. Upon further investigation, we find that the general's sister Lady Dormer has also died the very same day. Poor George will only inherit 2000 pounds. However, who gets the lion's share of the estate all hinges on who died first. Lord peter as a friend and a snoopy armature sleuth must ascertain the answer and if there is foul play the perpetrator. In any case, this is a most unpleasantness at the Bellona Club.I think sometime these programs are made for those that have already read the book because you cannot put everything from the book into the series the highlights and major information is all there but some of the how they got to the information is missing in obvious gaps.

But I love the Edward Petherbridge Wimsey adaptations, and was wary of this older series (especially since the reviews noted how creaky the production values are).  It took me a little while to warm to the very different characterizations, and to the videotaped, rather spartan look, but I've grown to love these shows.  The stories are solid, the mysteries satisfying, and the characters interesting.  I particularly love the slower pacing that the length of each story allows: plenty of time is taken for local color, or to explain how bells are pealed, for instance.  The acting is uneven; sometimes it's pretty hammy.  The sets can be barely better than a stage play, and the props and paintings placed ""outside"" windows to give the illusion of a view are hilariously bad.  But of course, all this was meant to be seen on a small, low-def TV, so you can't fault the producers there.

And like some viewers, when I saw Ian Carmichael's version, I did not at first like it, finding him (a) too old and (b) too flippant as the sleuth.  But Carmichael has grown on me over the years, and I now enjoy him thoroughly as Lord Peter Wimsey.Yes, at the time of filming, Carmichael was about 10 years too old for the part (which is why this review gives 4 stars instead of 5).  One either gets past that or one doesn't.  I have, and there are many virtues to appreciate in his portrayal.  I find Petherbridge's and Carmichael's respective Lord Peters to be complimentary: Petherbridge has the gravitas but lacks the light-hearted craziness; the reverse is true with Carmichael.  I would not want to be without either.The adaptations themselves are excellent, with superb scripts that stay faithful to the books, and uniformly wonderful supporting casts (well, except maybe for Derek Newark's stale, flat Bunter, fortunately seen only in ""The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club"").  Isabel Jeans' Dowager Duchess (in ""Clouds of Witness"") is a special treat.  (""Well, he won't do muhduh heah - I won't have it!"").  David Langdon's Duke of Denver (also in ""C.O.W."") is excellent, too, although I keep seeing Richard Bellamy of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" and so lose a bit of the not-too-bright country squire character that Sayers wrote.  Donald Eccles is perfect as the kindly, absent-minded Rev. Venables in ""The Nine Tailors.""  And there is luxury casting with Sheila Keith as a frosty, formidable housekeeper in ""Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club.""The DVD transfers are excellent, better than the previous DVD iteration.Highly recommended, and essential to fans of Dorothy L.

1289085,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B002TY78PU,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[71, 72]","Dorothy Sayers created a rather unusual sleuth in Lord Peter Wimsey -- think Bertie Wooster, except with a formidable crime-solving brain and a haunted past. And ""The Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries: Set 1"" brings together two of the solid BBC adaptations of her works, which are hampered mainly by the fact that the cast is a bit old for their roles.In ""Clouds of Witness"" Peter is on vacation when he finds out that his brother, The Duke of Denver (informally ""Gerald""), is on trial for murder -- he had a blowup with his sister Mary's fiancee, Denis Cathcart, and the next morning, Cathcart was found shot through the heart by Gerald's gun, with Gerald bending over the body. The Duke stubbornly refuses to explain why he was out in the rain at three in the morning.Peter is determined to solve the case, and quickly finds plenty of clues and odd little details, including the fact that Mary keeps lying (and changing her lies) and Gerald has some secrets that have to be unearthed. There are too many clues, and not enough motives. To save his brother, Peter must unravel plenty of lies and red herrings, and discover who wanted to do away with Denis Cathcart, and why.""The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club"" happens while Peter is lunching with his mentally fragile friend George Fentimen -- elderly General Fentiman expires in his chair. Because the exact time of death is unknown (and the general's sister died at around the same time), it's not clear who the inheritance is going to. And when the body is exhumed and examined, it's found that the old guy was actually poisoned.Among the cash-strapped relatives are George (who's never recovered from WWI, is poverty-stricken and appears to be schizophrenic), his snotty brother Robert, and the artist Ann Dorland -- but theoretically any member of the Bellona Club could have done it. Of course, Peter is called on to unravel a snaggly mass of lies, deceptions, tricks and secret motives... and uncovers a devious plot that nobody could have guessed at.The BBC did an excellent job preserving the spirit of Dorothy Sayers' classic mystery novels, steeped in the atmosphere of post-World War I England -- gentlemen's clubs, tweed jackets, wood-paneled manorhouses and flapper dresses. There's incisive wit in the dialogue, clever humor (""We need a new syntax! We need it now!""), and an array of characters from cutting-edge artists to fusty old gentry, from wussy socialists to flaky flappers.Even better, these are genuine whodunnits. Both mysteries are tangles of lies, deceptions, infidelities, errors and the occasional bizarre twist such as Peter falling into a quicksand-like bog. In both cases there are only a few possible suspects and even fewer motives, but as the plot unfolds Peter wrangles out a sensible solution that explains everything (and usually without too many disasters along the way).Perhaps the biggest problem of the story is that the cast is a bit long in the tooth: Ian Carmichael, Rachel Herbert and Anna Cropper are all at least a decade older than their characters are. It's a bit weird, especially since Carmichael is old enough to be his own character's dad.But despite being in his mid-fifties, Ian Carmichael plays Wimsey with a light, incisive touch and a clever tongue (""I like facts... and there are remarkably few of them in this case""), and he's a likably plausible detective who can be steely when the occasion demands it. Glyn Houston is a warmly jolly Bunter, and he's sorely missed in ""Unpleasantness"" -- instead we get the lukewarm, forgettable Derek Newark.""Lord Peter Wimsey Collection, Set 1"" has a cast that's a bit old for their roles. But otherwise it's a solid pair of murder mysteries that stick close to the original books.",4,I say!,1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,3730,"['Dorothy', 'Sayers', 'created', 'rather', 'unusual', 'sleuth', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'Wimsey', 'think', 'Bertie', 'Wooster', 'formidable', 'crime-solving', 'brain', 'haunted', 'past', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'Wimsey', 'Mysteries', 'Set', '1', 'together', 'two', 'solid', 'BBC', 'adaptations', 'works', 'are', 'hampered', 'mainly', 'fact', 'cast', 'bit', 'old', 'roles.In', 'Clouds', 'Witness', 'Peter', 'vacation', 'when', 'out', 'brother', 'Duke', 'Denver', 'informally', 'Gerald', 'trial', 'murder', 'had', 'blowup', 'sister', 'Mary', 'fiancee', 'Denis', 'Cathcart', 'next', 'morning', 'Cathcart', 'was', 'found', 'shot', 'heart', 'Gerald', 'gun', 'Gerald', 'bending', 'body', 'Duke', 'stubbornly', 'explain', 'why', 'was', 'out', 'rain', 'three', 'morning.Peter', 'determined', 'solve', 'case', 'quickly', 'plenty', 'clues', 'odd', 'little', 'details', 'including', 'fact', 'Mary', 'keeps', 'lying', 'changing', 'lies', 'Gerald', 'secrets', 'have', 'be', 'unearthed', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'clues', 'not', 'enough', 'motives', 'save', 'brother', 'Peter', 'must', 'unravel', 'plenty', 'lies', 'red', 'herrings', 'discover', 'who', 'wanted', 'do', 'away', 'Denis', 'Cathcart', 'why', 'Unpleasantness', 'Bellona', 'Club', 'Peter', 'lunching', 'mentally', 'fragile', 'friend', 'George', 'Fentimen', 'elderly', 'General', 'Fentiman', 'chair', 'exact', 'time', 'death', 'unknown', 'general', 'sister', 'died', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'clear', 'who', 'inheritance', 'going', 'when', 'body', 'exhumed', 'examined', 'found', 'old', 'guy', 'was', 'actually', 'poisoned.Among', 'cash-strapped', 'relatives', 'are', 'George', 'who', 'never', 'recovered', 'WWI', 'poverty-stricken', 'be', 'schizophrenic', 'snotty', 'brother', 'Robert', 'artist', 'Ann', 'Dorland', 'theoretically', 'member', 'Bellona', 'Club', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'course', 'Peter', 'called', 'unravel', 'snaggly', 'mass', 'lies', 'deceptions', 'tricks', 'secret', 'motives', 'uncovers', 'devious', 'plot', 'nobody', 'could', 'have', 'guessed', 'at.The', 'BBC', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'preserving', 'spirit', 'Dorothy', 'Sayers', 'classic', 'mystery', 'novels', 'steeped', 'atmosphere', 'post-World', 'War', 'England', 'gentlemen', 'clubs', 'tweed', 'jackets', 'wood-paneled', 'manorhouses', 'flapper', 'dresses', 'incisive', 'wit', 'dialogue', 'clever', 'humor', 'need', 'new', 'syntax', 'need', 'now', 'array', 'characters', 'cutting-edge', 'artists', 'fusty', 'old', 'gentry', 'wussy', 'socialists', 'flaky', 'flappers.Even', 'better', 'are', 'genuine', 'whodunnits', 'mysteries', 'are', 'tangles', 'lies', 'deceptions', 'infidelities', 'errors', 'occasional', 'bizarre', 'twist', 'such', 'Peter', 'falling', 'quicksand-like', 'bog', 'cases', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'possible', 'suspects', 'even', 'fewer', 'motives', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'Peter', 'out', 'sensible', 'solution', 'everything', 'usually', 'too', 'many', 'disasters', 'way', 'biggest', 'problem', 'story', 'cast', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'Ian', 'Carmichael', 'Rachel', 'Herbert', 'Anna', 'Cropper', 'are', 'least', 'decade', 'older', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'weird', 'especially', 'Carmichael', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'own', 'character', 'dad.But', 'being', 'mid-fifties', 'Ian', 'Carmichael', 'Wimsey', 'light', 'incisive', 'touch', 'clever', 'tongue', 'like', 'facts', 'are', 'remarkably', 'few', 'case', 'likably', 'plausible', 'detective', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'steely', 'when', 'occasion', 'Glyn', 'Houston', 'warmly', 'jolly', 'Bunter', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Unpleasantness', 'instead', 'get', 'lukewarm', 'forgettable', 'Derek', 'Newark', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'Wimsey', 'Collection', 'Set', '1', 'cast', 'bit', 'old', 'roles', 'solid', 'pair', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'stick', 'close', 'original', 'books']",The Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries: Set 1
1289086,A12H0TJCUPJPI6,B002TY78PU,genesrus,"[6, 20]","A self confessed anglophile (as far as TV productions go) I was VERY disappointed. Read many of the wonderful reviews on here and ended up buying set One - glad that I bought just the one! If you must, RENT before you BUY.I'd break down my criticism into two different categories:1. The quality of the DVD transfer - IT WAS GOD AWFUL! We've watched and own to the manor born, yes prime minister and these are late 70's early 80's shows that show their age on a 55"" hi-def flatscreen TV but are enjoyable despite their graininess. Peter Wimpy is just dreadful in comparison to even these antiquated shows. The low light transfer makes the pictures incredibly grainy and the sets DO NOT LEND themselves to a hi-def environment. I suspect on my old CRT it may have been palatable- but only just! Perhaps between 1972 and 1978 the quality of productions/ technology improved? Again, I don't feel that expecting something of the caliber of `to the manor born' is too much to ask - by way of the technical quality of the transfer onto DVD. AGAIN, I am not talking about acting- just the inherent quality of the product - Think of a mono recording on SW radio being played through a 96 KHz blue-ray on a high end music system. A few minutes maybe - but the whole show!!2. Now we get to the acting - contrived and of a bygone era. I felt the whole thing was pretentious to say the least. Nothing felt right, the sets, the period pieces on the screen - keep in mind this is supposed to be set in the 20's. I find myself comparing it to the set on Downton Abbey (same time period). Despite having reservations about that show, the cast/ acting (and of course the technological advances) and the sets were just superb - perhaps not a fair comparison. But I still can't get over the acting and the whole setup - reminded me of some bollywood production of yesteryear that immigrated to the BBC. Again, I love a show like Morse and was expecting perhaps something of that ilk- or Foyle's War maybe - but NO!My criticisms undoubtedly reflect a generational divide.

If you're read the Wimsey mysteries (and I have them all), you know that there's a lot of angst rattling around in Wimsey's brain, which his outward flippancy belies.  Ian Carmichael plays Wimsey as almost stolid, which all ""good"" British gentlemen of the period were expected to be, just look at Peter's brother, the Duke.  The whole point of Lord Peter, however, is that he has flashes of very un-stolidness.I will admit that Petherbridge's Wimsey is a bit more melodramatic and ""romantic"".  But I like it that way.

Viewing them today, I must say I'm much less impressed. Like a few others, I think Ian Carmichael is just too old for the role, though he does a reasonable job with it. The series is dragged down, however, by self-consciousness about the period setting. Moreover, as at least one other reviewer has noted, the acting and direction are reminiscent of live theater rather than film -- there are pauses and glances meant to be significant which all to often become tedious and overly-long. And there is the usual problem with British productions of this era, where exteriors are filmed while interiors are shot in video, creating a subliminal (or not-so-subliminal) sense of discontinuity.

Exteriors were filmed using mediocre-quality 16mm film stock (movies and U.S. TV shows use 35mm film which is 4X the size) and as a result are noticeably grainy and blurry when viewed on modern equipment; this was not nearly as obvious on the TV sets of 1972.In ""Unpleasantness"" the amount of George Fentiman's inheritance in his father's will is 2,000 Pounds, which very roughly converts to something around US $125,000 in 2010.
