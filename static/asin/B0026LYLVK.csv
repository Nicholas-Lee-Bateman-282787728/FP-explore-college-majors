1251782,A313OU4NOWZDBY,B0026LYLVK,David R. Allen,"[1, 2]","""My Dinner With Jimi"" (2003) is a great ""snap shot"" of counterculture times much better than other ""portraits of the 60's.""The 60's (which actually took place roughly from 1964 through 1974) were interesting, hopeful times. You had to be there (and the screenplay writer, Howard Kaylan, was there) to understand it, why it was good, important, worth remembering.And how it worked.A lot of good things were done, and done because young people wanted to have fun with their adult lives after formal education, and not be chained, tethered to wage slavery or equivalent slavery always part of the ""entrepreneur"" life.Most people face wage slavery or the entrepreneur's life, and that was true both before and after the 60's....Almost nobody is a pure inheritor guaranteed big money, undisputed property ownership, and an important, interesting occupation until he dies, except maybe Prince Charles of England and a small number of people in his same situation.The 60's suggested that other possibilities might happen in the lives of people who came of age back then, and that included entertainer people like Howard Kaylan of the TURTLES pop music group, and later part of the Frank Zappa band called THE MOTHERS OF INVENTION (for part of the 1970's).The Howard Kaylan ""voice over"" actor states at the start of this movie...""When high school graduation came and went, I decided to put college on hold....and do something different!"" (I paraphrase).Many decided to ""do something different"" or at least try it, and many had good results and times as a result.....MY DINNER WITH JIMI (2003) is all about that, and for all it's shortcomings, is precious because of that, and worth getting and screening often.The 60's were different, hopeful, and are worth remembering the way Kaylan has remembered it.....for all the technical and artistic shortcomings of this movie, the overall message and mentality shines through in a way other ""memoirs"" of various types of the 60's counterculture times and people mostly have failed to do.BTW, this movie portrays the lives of two members of the 1960's pop music group called the TURTLES....Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman.Actual movie/video footage of these two gifted comedians and vocal musicians performing astonishingly can be seen in two other videos about and part of the 1960's era.One is titled THE TRUE STORY OF 200 MOTELS (1984) documentary by Frank Zappa about the making of his 1971 feature avant Gard movie which stars both Kaylan and Volman (they are more prominently shown than Zappa himself is...Zappa was behind the scenes most of the time).The other movie starring Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman shown in their middle 20's is the actual 200 MOTELS (1971) movie itself.Get both in addition to MY DINNER WITH JIMI (2003) to have the best portrait of the two TURTLES stars, one of whom wrote the screenplay for MY DINNER WITH JIMI (2003).Well..........I got a MY DINNER WITH JIMI (2005) 60's pop music nostalgia movie yesterday, and watched part of it before bedtime.It's a docudrama memoir acted by modern (recent younger) actors about famous pop singers meeting each other during the 60's done by Howard Kaylan who was part of the TURTLES and later joined Frank Zappa's MOTHERS OF INVENTION.Howard Kaylan (1947 - ) wrote an autobiographical screenplay produced in 2003....done on no money, promoted at minor film festivals, never a mainstream movie......I liked it.Obviously a very cheaply done movie (younger actors especially weren't ideal, and the direction wasn't wonderful, either), but the movie made it's points, and it made me remember the good old days I enjoyed so much, now long gone.One had to think of the movie as sort of a Greek masked stage drama where the actors were sort of gross symbols of the people they were portraying.The older actors (not many, since it was a movie about the ""youth culture"" of the 60's) were very good, few of them as there were.....shows how many old actors are out there willing to be in cheap, ""indy"" movies.The TURTLES wrote the song titled ""You, Baby, Nobody But You"" which I heard the Mamas and the Papas sing, and the song is featured in the movie.I got the lyrics for the song, and played it on my always handy and available ukulele before going to bed. GREAT SONG!""A little bit of sunshine! A little bit of soul! And just a touch of magic! ""It's the greatest thing since Rock and Roll!""Same mentality as THE LOVIN SPOONFUL and it's ""Good Time Music"" (""Do You Believe In Magic?"" etc.) Terrific, light, fun....brought back the good times, loud colors, etc.One big problem presenting a movie about famous music and musicians of the 1960's is that copyright laws and claims make it almost impossible to include any of the music famous in the 1960's and mentioned in MY DINNER WITH JIMI (2003). Only the TURTLES music and hit songs are played, and other music is not presented, though clever ways are found to suggest such music.....Movie titles were in the gaudy, noisy Peter Maxx style, which was great. Authentic for the times and re-visiting it.The movie shows the protagonists meeting up with other famous pop singer types at nighttime food and after-hours joints in L.A. and London! A lot of banter light, air-headed, and fun, fun, fun, which was the main point of the times!You had to be there to understand how great the 60's were, and it's important not to be bitter about how it all ended, promise unfulfilled......Howard Kaylan's movie isn't bitter...it's fun...and so were the 60's at their best.----------------Tex Allen is a SAG movie actor.See the Amazon.Com profile for David R.

I read about this film a while back and when I couldn't get it at my local video store decided to buy the DVD. What a disappointment. Having watched Frank Zappa's movie 200 Motels and listened to the real life interactions between band members from the Turtles captured on the album Playground Psychotics, I know the people portrayed in this movie were interesting and funny. There is material here for a great movie about the LA and London music scenes. Unfortunately this isn't it.  The sets, clothes, acting, and writing seem like an extended skit from a bad TV show. The dialog consists of constant lines like ""wow I can't believe I'm smokin dope with Donovan!"" All the acting is awful but the worst are the guys who try to be Zappa and Morrison, unbelievably awful. I've seen more professionalism in high school plays. Its not even in the ""so bad its good"" category.

1251785,A2YXWAA7R4KIRC,B0026LYLVK,"lbrlartist ""stinkerbelle""","[1, 1]","Amazon wisely suggested this for me after I bought Howard Kaylan's new autobiography, Shell Shocked (great book, by the way).  It looked interesting and I certainly knew of all the principals, so I ordered it.What a delight! All of the events in the film are expanded upon in Shell Shocked and to see them ""in the flesh"" as it were made them even funnier.  One of my favorite pieces depicted Howard's and Mark Volman's efforts to avoid the draft. Simply as storytelling it is hilarious, but for those of us who lived during the Vietman War era, it is hilarious and so very real.  I personally knew so many guys who used so many of the same devices to obtain the blessed 4-F.  Watching Howard and Mark do it made me smile (and laugh VERY hard).The Turtles in London chapter of the film I just loved because I was/am so familiar with the players portrayed.  Who WASN'T a huge fan of The Turtles, Donovan, Graham Nash, The Moody Blues, Brian Jones and of course, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix?  I really think one has to have a complete familiarity with these other musicians and their impact to really appreciate this film and the events depicted.  The Beatles are portrayed exactly as I imagined they were at the time.  Jimi Hendrix is portrayed as such a kind, modest and gentle soul - as he stood at the precipice of his own stardom.  I had always read such about him; it was nice to see it portrayed on film.I was younger than my heroes depicted in this movie and therefore, these guys always seemed so very cool and floating above the rest of us.  This little film gave a different perspective and closer to what they really were:  young guys who were indeed very cool, but they were young guys just like the ones I knew - with all of the same insecurities, goofiness and hormones.I guess the nicest thing I can say about this film is that it left me with such a smile and good remembrances of those wonderful times. There are movies that leave us with such and then there are those that illuminate and ""color in"" some pieces we didn't know about.  This one does both.I am so glad I ordered it!",5,What a gem!,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,2096,"['Amazon', 'wisely', 'suggested', 'bought', 'Howard', 'Kaylan', 'new', 'autobiography', 'Shell', 'Shocked', 'great', 'book', 'way', 'looked', 'interesting', 'certainly', 'knew', 'principals', 'ordered', 'it.What', 'delight', 'events', 'film', 'are', 'expanded', 'Shell', 'Shocked', 'see', 'flesh', 'were', 'made', 'even', 'funnier', 'One', 'favorite', 'pieces', 'depicted', 'Howard', 'Mark', 'Volman', 'efforts', 'avoid', 'draft', 'Simply', 'storytelling', 'hilarious', 'who', 'lived', 'Vietman', 'War', 'era', 'hilarious', 'so', 'very', 'real', 'personally', 'knew', 'so', 'many', 'guys', 'who', 'used', 'so', 'many', 'same', 'devices', 'obtain', 'blessed', '4-F', 'Watching', 'Howard', 'Mark', 'do', 'made', 'smile', 'laugh', 'VERY', 'hard', '.The', 'Turtles', 'London', 'chapter', 'film', 'just', 'loved', 'was/am', 'so', 'familiar', 'players', 'portrayed', 'Who', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Turtles', 'Donovan', 'Graham', 'Nash', 'Moody', 'Blues', 'Brian', 'Jones', 'course', 'Beatles', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'really', 'think', 'one', 'have', 'complete', 'familiarity', 'other', 'musicians', 'impact', 'really', 'appreciate', 'film', 'events', 'depicted', 'Beatles', 'are', 'portrayed', 'exactly', 'imagined', 'were', 'time', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'portrayed', 'such', 'kind', 'modest', 'gentle', 'soul', 'stood', 'precipice', 'own', 'stardom', 'had', 'always', 'read', 'such', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'portrayed', 'film.I', 'was', 'younger', 'heroes', 'depicted', 'movie', 'therefore', 'guys', 'always', 'seemed', 'so', 'very', 'cool', 'floating', 'rest', 'little', 'film', 'gave', 'different', 'perspective', 'closer', 'what', 'really', 'were', 'young', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'indeed', 'very', 'cool', 'were', 'young', 'guys', 'just', 'ones', 'knew', 'same', 'insecurities', 'goofiness', 'hormones.I', 'guess', 'nicest', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'left', 'smile', 'good', 'remembrances', 'wonderful', 'times', 'are', 'movies', 'leave', 'such', 'then', 'are', 'illuminate', 'color', 'pieces', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'one', 'both.I', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'ordered']",N/A
