They take turns being a housewife in different cultures and lifestyles. They are put in binds that the every day person goes through like getting kids dressed for school, making dinner, child's birthday party, and trying to pencil in a vacation which they have never done before. I like this season due to the different concept the girls come up with rather than traveling across the nation in a truck (Season 1), work enough hours so they can get to the next milestone (Season 2), or even trying their hand at being interns (Season 3).I highly recommend getting this season if you love the show and see how they can mess up such a simple task.",5,The next chapter with Paris and Nicole,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,736,"['season', 'girls', 'up', 'due', 'dispute', 'had', 'have', 'yet', 'figure', 'out', 'take', 'turns', 'being', 'housewife', 'different', 'cultures', 'lifestyles', 'are', 'put', 'binds', 'day', 'person', 'getting', 'kids', 'dressed', 'school', 'making', 'dinner', 'child', 'birthday', 'party', 'trying', 'pencil', 'vacation', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'season', 'due', 'different', 'concept', 'girls', 'come', 'up', 'rather', 'traveling', 'nation', 'truck', 'Season', '1', 'work', 'enough', 'hours', 'can', 'get', 'next', 'milestone', 'Season', '2', 'even', 'trying', 'hand', 'being', 'interns', 'Season', '3', '.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'season', 'love', 'show', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'mess', 'up', 'such', 'simple', 'task']",The Simple Life: Season 4 - 'Til Death Do Us Part

1019882,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000ICLRL6,Richard Ross,"[4, 4]","With the exception of 'The Simple Life Goes To Camp', I've seen every season of the show, so I feel pretty confident when I say that this was, by far, the worst season out of all of 'em. Not only was it unbearable to watch, but quite insulting as well. Insulting to the families - many of whom were minorities - and insulting to the viewers that E! obviously counted on to watch and buy what they were seeing. It's easily the worst season of anything they've ever broadcast and how it managed to survive for all 10 episodes without getting cancelled is beyond me.For this season of the show the girls took turns playing housewife to a different family each week. Typical chores included cooking, cleaning, looking after the little ones and keeping an eye on the husbands. But what overshadowed everything was the fact that Paris and Nicole were locked in a nasty feud with each other. Since the two weren't talking, they refused to appear onscreen together. (They do briefly share the screen in the first and last episode, but even then all they do is sling insults at one another and glare at each other with blank, hateful eyes.) To get around this technical difficulty the producers used split-screens to show each girl arriving at the house and greeting the family, before switching back and forth between Paris' week and Nicole's week with the family. There were so many split-screens I felt like I was watching a DePalma movie. Out of the 10 families only 2 really stood out. The first one was about a lush of a husband (who bore a passing resemblance to Ray Winstone) who actually called himself ""Captain Tequila"". While Nicole was quite eager to pour him shot after shot, Paris wanted to focus on his other hobbies, which included golf. While at the club, Paris begs him to buy her a pink golf bag that cost $3,977. After he does, she promptly ruins it by driving their golf cart into a lake. During Nicole's week, she convinces the husband to make a sexy calendar for his wife. Good ol' Tequila is only too happy to strip down and pose for 12 provocative shots. It's pretty funny actually and easily ranks as the best episode of the season. The second best features a prissy husband with a voice that rivals Richard Simmons. He's an OCD freak who demands an immaculate house and who has no qualms telling people off when they don't live up to his high standards. There's far too much dumb Paris stuff in the episode like her overflowing the washng machine and using a leaf blower to get rid of the excess bubbles or smashing all kinds of breakables in a futile effort to kill a cockroach. She does have one funny moment - in a strictly sadistic way - when she falls off a Segway after getting the bright idea to drive it over a freshly scrubbed floor. The real highlight of the episode comes when Nicole takes the family to a clothing store and gives them all makeovers. She dresses the dad up as a pirate and, given his effeminate mannerisms, it's one of those things you have to see for yourself to truly appreciate how funny it is. These were the only 2 episodes I found enjoyable. The other 8 are too outrageous to get into. The most offensive moment came when Paris, babysitting a Mexican family, took the kids to her mansion without telling their parents. Along with her aunt (who's just as rude), Paris watches as the kids raid her closets and swim in her pool. When the worried parents finally track down their kids and come to pick them up, Paris and her aunt actually laugh in their faces. This is only one of the many instances throughout the season where Paris proves just how vapid, talentless and rude she actually is. For one thing she speaks in her annoying baby voice the ENTIRE time. Also, she seems like she was already rocking the nose candy. There are 2 scenes in particular (one featuring Three 6 Mafia) where she seems under the influence. Maybe Nicole had the right idea ditching her because nobody should have to put up with her despicable behavior just because she's rich and famous. Plus, she has gross hands. Unfortunately, Nicole doesn't look all that great either since this was during her emaciated frame time. Even though she's painfully frail, she proves once again how witty and lightning quick she is. She provides all the laughs this season through an endless supply of one-liners. Being freed from Paris may have been the best thing that ever happened to her since she seems more relaxed and confident enough to reveal more of herself than on any other season. Many of the families agree that she'll make a great mother one day. It speaks volumes for Nicole that she's settled down in a committed relationship and become a mother twice over while Paris is still sleeping around and getting busted for possession in a desperate attempt to remain in the spotlight.A month ago I wrote a glowing review of Season 3 claiming it showed a different side of Paris. I singled her out instead of complimenting Nicole enough. I wanted to correct that and this season did it for me. Paris reverted back to her old ways and Nicole finally claimed the spotlight she's rightfully deserved this whole time. The only incentive I have to watch Season 5 is to see how the ridiculous cliffhanger ending from this season gets resolved. It doesn't seem worth it. Just stick with the first 3 seasons and divorce yourself from this one entirely. Truly disappointing.",1,"It Must Be Time To Part, Because I Feel Dead Inside",1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,5388,"['exception', ""'The"", 'Simple', 'Life', 'Goes', 'Camp', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'season',

Of course I have no idea if these girls are truly dumb, but if I had to base my opinion on these movies I'd have to say 'yes'. That being said, the series is pretty entertaining. I find amazing the way these girls treat people, the people who open up their homes to them and just folk in general. They act like teen age kids who have had no direction or parental influence in their lives. Just because you are extremely well to do does not mean that you should not have basic manners or social skills. I understand that this series is meant as entertainment and not really a look at the girls 'real' lives, but it sure serves as a clue what those lives must be like. And hey, if I inherited a ton of money, who's to say I wouldn't become just as irresponsible?
