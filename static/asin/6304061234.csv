I have over 18 S.S. videos/dvd's and only the 3 mentioned are worth watching and the money I paid for them. Please don't get me wrong, I love Sesame Street and I grew up with the S.S. addiction for most of my childhood-but The Childrens Workshop company is not the greatest at making videos.",3,"Menza,  Menza",1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,783,"['Not', 'greatest', 'video', 'even', 'exersize', 'tape', 'matter', 'was', 'cute', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'means', 'getting', 'kids', 'exersize', 'more-they', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'get', 'up', 'move', 'stits-but', 'other', 'not', 'what', 'heading', 'claims.The', '3', 'best', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'videos', 'have', 'are', '1,2,3', 'Count', 'Me', '-with', 'Ernie', 'host', 'video', 'Great', 'Numbers', 'Game', '-with', 'Telly', 'Elmo', 'hosts', 'Lets', 'Do', 'Alphabet', 'Big', 'Bird', 'Baby', 'Bear', 'hosts', 'have', 'over', '18', 'S.S.', 'videos/dvd', 'only', '3', 'mentioned', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'money', 'paid', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'grew', 'up', 'S.S.', 'addiction', 'most', 'childhood-but', 'Childrens', 'Workshop', 'company', 'not', 'greatest', 'making', 'videos']",Sesame Street - Elmocize VHS

It's not my favorite, but, of course, I bought it for my daughter, now 17 months.  She enjoys it simply because Elmo is in it, and she loves his voice.  However, in the segments when Elmo isn't involved, she does tend to lose interest.  As a teacher who is married to a former special ed. bus driver, I agree it's important to include children with a wide range of abilities; unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, Workout in a Chair is pretty bad in a &quot;grate on your nerves&quot; sort of way.  We don't watch this one often, but it makes a good filler when we've seen our other videos too much in the last week.Not the best Elmo video, but if you're like me, and need to rotate your videos for your own sanity, go ahead and add it to your collection.",3,Worth adding to your Sesame Street &quot;rotation&quot;,973209600,"11 3, 2000",2000,871,"['Ok', 'got', 'one', 'title', 'Anything', 'quot', 'Elmo', 'quot', 'will', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'home', 'not', 'favorite', 'course', 'bought', 'daughter', 'now', '17', 'months', 'simply', 'Elmo', 'voice', 'However', 'segments', 'when', 'Elmo', ""n't"", 'involved', 'tend', 'lose', 'interest', 'teacher', 'who', 'married', 'former', 'special', 'ed', 'bus', 'driver', 'agree', 'important', 'include', 'children', 'wide', 'range', 'abilities', 'unfortunately', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'Workout', 'Chair', 'pretty', 'bad', 'quot', 'grate', 'nerves', 'quot', 'sort', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'one', 'often', 'good', 'filler', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'videos', 'too', 'much', 'last', 'week.Not', 'best', 'Elmo', 'video', ""'re"", 'need', 'rotate', 'videos', 'own', 'sanity', 'go', 'ahead', 'add', 'collection']",Sesame Street - Elmocize VHS

From the moment I played it I wasn't keen on it, but unfortunately my little one liked it. However, he does request it as much as he use to. After 4 or 5 months of it, he's done. Thank God! I think he was just happy to see Elmo more than anything. He really DIDN'T LIKE the segment with the carton catapillar (with German accent) singing to get kids to stretch. He would shout ""NO! NO! NO!) and make me fast forward it. It was great seeing Cyndi Lauper twisting and trying to do a cabana routine. Pure silliness!

399122,A39UPRGT8Z0AIE,6304061234,"Jaina Solo ""jainasolo@aol.com""","[52, 54]","If Elmo were interviewed, and they asked him about &quot;Elmocize,&quot; he'd have to make excuses.  He was young... he didn't know what he was doing.We own this tape as part of our VAST Sesame Street and Elmo collection, since our daughter loves the furry red monster with every ounce of her being.  But I have to say that &quot;Elmocize&quot; is the absolute worst Elmo video out there (well, that we've found, anyway).  The concept, getting kids to move to the beat, have fun, and exercise with Elmo, is a good one.  However, this unfortunate tape was made at one of the low points (in my opinion) in Sesame Street history.  The cast at the time was, er, less than talented.  So, I have to agree with a previous reviewer--the poor girl who runs the dance studio couldn't sing her way out of a wet paper bag (I guess that's why she's a dancer!).  It's not ALL her fault, though--the songs are really weak here!  It starts with the insipid &quot;Elmocize!  Elmocize!  Everybody . . . Elmocize!&quot;  Repeat, repeat, repeat.  You'll be thinking &quot;Elmocide!  Elmocide!  Somebody . . . commit Elmocide!&quot;  And we LOVE Elmo!  Even the Sesame Street kids on the tape seem really, really bored--like they'd rather be studying multiplication.  Put it this way--when and if our daughter ever gets to that &quot;rip the tape out of the cassette for fun&quot; stage, I hope this one's the first to go.",1,Ugh--this is the one Elmo denies having made...,981417600,"02 6, 2001",2001,1401,"['Elmo', 'were', 'interviewed', 'asked', 'quot', 'Elmocize', 'quot', ""'d"", 'have', 'make', 'excuses', 'was', 'young', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'doing.We', 'own', 'tape', 'part', 'VAST', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'Elmo', 'collection', 'daughter', 'furry', 'red', 'monster', 'ounce', 'being', 'have', 'say', 'quot', 'Elmocize', 'quot', 'absolute', 'worst', 'Elmo', 'video', 'there', 'well', ""'ve"", 'found', 'anyway', 'concept', 'getting', 'kids', 'move', 'beat', 'have', 'fun', 'exercise', 'Elmo', 'good', 'one', 'However', 'unfortunate', 'tape', 'was', 'made', 'one', 'low', 'points', 'opinion', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'history', 'cast', 'time', 'was', 'er', 'less', 'talented', 'So', 'have', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'poor', 'girl', 'who', 'dance', 'studio', 'could', ""n't"", 'sing', 'way', 'wet', 'paper', 'bag', 'guess', 'why', 'dancer', 'not', 'ALL', 'fault', 'though', 'songs', 'are', 'really', 'weak', 'here', 'insipid', 'quot', 'Elmocize', 'Elmocize', 'Everybody', 'Elmocize', 'quot', 'Repeat', 'repeat', 'repeat', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Elmocide', 'Elmocide', 'Somebody', 'commit', 'Elmocide', 'quot', 'LOVE', 'Elmo', 'Even', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'kids', 'tape', 'seem', 'really', 'really', 'bored', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'studying', 'multiplication', 'Put', 'way', 'when', 'daughter', 'ever', 'quot', 'tape', 'cassette', 'fun', 'quot', 'stage', 'hope', 'one', 'first', 'go']",Sesame Street - Elmocize VHS

And in that sense, it works beautifully; my 2 1/2 year old is up and singing and dancing for the whole 30 minutes.It's true that the moves are a little free form, but what do I expect for a toddler? (I don't WANT her to think that if she's not ""perfect"" it doesn't count! I want her to be happy to move her body to the music.) It's true that the workout in a chair woman probably doesn't make the bulk of her living singing. But she obviously loves to dance, loves kids, and inspires them to move with her so this video does exactly what it should do.So why did I deduct one star?  I, personally, don't enjoy those songs very much and since my daughter does I hear them a lot anyway. I will be recommending this product to parents looking for an excercise video for little ones, and I'll also give them fair warning that this isn't the one the whole family is likely to enjoy.",4,Kinda depends on what you want and need,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,1007,"['think', 'part', 'point', 'was', 'exercise', 'can', 'be', 'fun', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'done', 'exactly', 'right', 'just', 'get', 'up', 'move', 'sense', 'beautifully', '2', '1/2', 'year', 'old', 'up', 'singing', 'dancing', 'whole', '30', 'minutes.It', 'true', 'moves', 'are', 'little', 'free', 'form', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'toddler', 'do', ""n't"", 'WANT', 'think', 'not', 'perfect', ""n't"", 'count', 'want', 'be', 'happy', 'move', 'body', 'music', 'true', 'workout', 'chair', 'woman', 'probably', ""n't"", 'make', 'bulk', 'living', 'singing', 'obviously', 'dance', 'kids', 'move', 'so', 'video', 'exactly', 'what', 'should', 'do.So', 'why', 'did', 'deduct', 'one', 'star', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'songs', 'very', 'much', 'daughter', 'hear', 'lot', 'anyway', 'will', 'be', 'recommending', 'product', 'parents', 'looking', 'excercise', 'video', 'little', 'ones', ""'ll"", 'also', 'give', 'fair', 'warning', ""n't"", 'one', 'whole', 'family', 'likely', 'enjoy']",Sesame Street - Elmocize VHS
