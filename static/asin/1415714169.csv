169717,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,1415714169,Cubist,"[161, 164]","MTV wanted to branch out in the 1990s and get away from music programming. In particular, they wanted to produce late night programming for a young adult audience. The result was a collection of animated shows collectively known as Liquid Television. Aeon Flux originally got its start as a series of animated short films on Liquid T.V. in 1992. It was a clever mix of dialogue-less wall-to-wall action and an intriguing science fiction premise that was popular enough to spawn a ten-episode series in 1995.Chung has digitally remastered all of the episodes and they have never looked or sounded better. The colours are much more vibrant and the animation style more clearly defined with shadows fleshed out creating an even more cinematic vibe. What is so striking about Aeon Flux is that it refuses to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It features very intricately plotted and complex stories and sneaks in all sorts of fantastical creations (including spider-like robots and deadly genetically engineered assassins with four arms), suggestive sexual references and the level of violence that you wouldn't find on regular television. Along with The Maxx and The Head, Aeon Flux was adventurous programming for the alternative nation. It was produced at a time when alternative culture was making serious inroads into the mainstream and it is doubtful that we will see its likes again from MTV.The first two discs feature several audio commentaries with creator Peter Chung and key creative crew members (including the voice of Aeon Flux herself, Denise Poirier). However, most of them are tedious as Chung is not the most eloquent or interesting speaker. He dominates most of the tracks so that everyone else has to fight to get a word in edge-wise. While it is clear that he is trying to articulate his intentions on these tracks they are punctuated with so many ""Ums"" and ""Ahs"" that it becomes very annoying to listen past the halfway mark.The real extras come into play on the third disc which features the brilliant pilot episode with optional commentary by Chung and music and sound designer Drew Neumann. We are presented with a world that is plagued with a deadly virus as Aeon fights her way to an antidote.""Aeon Flux Shorts"" (again with optional commentary by Chung and Neumann) features Aeon on various missions all of which she dies. In some episodes she lasts to the end in others, she is killed off at the beginning and this keeps the viewer constantly on edge anticipating how she is going to be killed.""Investigation: The History of Aeon Flux"" takes a look at how this innovative series originated. Chung had been working on Rugrats and was approached by Liquid T.V. to do a Spy vs. Spy type animated show. He had already been working on the pilot in a rough form.""The Deviant Devices of Aeon Flux"" examines the various weapons and gadgets that she uses in the show with narration provided by her.""Production Art"" is a collection of sketches, model sheets, storyboards and pencil tests of character designs, props, backgrounds and so on.""Other Works by Peter Chung"" features a promo he did for MTV Loaded, an ad for an Aeon Flux CD ROM and a cool commercial for the Honda Coupe Mission.Finally, there is a collection of ""Liquid Television Shorts"" that appeared on this show in the `90s.",5,An impressive collection of this groundbreaking show.,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,3310,"['MTV', 'wanted', 'branch', 'out', '1990s', 'get', 'away', 'music', 'programming', 'particular', 'wanted', 'produce', 'late', 'night', 'programming', 'young', 'adult', 'audience', 'result', 'was', 'collection', 'animated', 'shows', 'collectively', 'known', 'Liquid', 'Television', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'originally', 'got', 'start', 'series', 'animated', 'short', 'films', 'Liquid', 'T.V', '1992', 'was', 'clever', 'mix', 'dialogue-less', 'wall-to-wall', 'action', 'intriguing', 'science', 'fiction', 'premise', 'was', 'popular', 'enough', 'spawn', 'ten-episode', 'series', '1995.Chung', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'episodes', 'have', 'never', 'looked', 'sounded', 'better', 'colours', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'vibrant', 'animation', 'style', 'more', 'clearly', 'defined', 'shadows', 'fleshed', 'out', 'creating', 'even', 'more', 'cinematic', 'vibe', 'What', 'so', 'striking', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'appeal', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'very', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'complex', 'stories', 'sneaks', 'sorts', 'fantastical', 'creations', 'including', 'spider-like', 'robots', 'deadly', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'assassins', 'four', 'arms', 'suggestive', 'sexual', 'references', 'level', 'violence', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'regular', 'television', 'Maxx', 'Head', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'was', 'adventurous', 'programming', 'alternative', 'nation', 'was', 'produced', 'time', 'when', 'alternative', 'culture', 'was', 'making', 'serious', 'inroads', 'mainstream', 'doubtful', 'will', 'see', 'likes', 'again', 'MTV.The', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'feature', 'several', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'creator', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'key', 'creative', 'crew', 'members', 'including', 'voice', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Denise', 'Poirier', 'However', 'most', 'are', 'tedious', 'Chung', 'not', 'most', 'eloquent', 'interesting', 'speaker', 'most', 'tracks', 'everyone', 'else', 'fight', 'get', 'word', 'edge-wise', 'clear', 'trying', 'articulate', 'intentions', 'tracks', 'are', 'punctuated', 'so', 'many', 'Ums', 'Ahs', 'very', 'annoying', 'listen', 'halfway', 'mark.The', 'real', 'extras', 'come', 'play', 'third', 'disc', 'brilliant', 'pilot', 'episode', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Chung', 'music', 'sound', 'designer', 'Drew', 'Neumann', 'are', 'presented', 'world', 'plagued', 'deadly', 'virus', 'Aeon', 'way', 'antidote', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Shorts', 'again', 'optional', 'commentary', 'Chung', 'Neumann', 'Aeon', 'various', 'missions', 'episodes', 'end', 'others', 'killed', 'off', 'beginning', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'edge', 'anticipating', 'how', 'going', 'be', 'killed', 'Investigation', 'History', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'look', 'how', 'innovative', 'series', 'originated', 'Chung', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'Rugrats', 'was', 'approached', 'Liquid', 'T.V', 'do', 'Spy', 'vs.', 'Spy', 'type', 'animated', 'show', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'working', 'pilot', 'rough', 'form', 'Deviant', 'Devices', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'various', 'weapons', 'gadgets', 'show', 'narration', 'provided', 'Production', 'Art', 'collection', 'sketches', 'model', 'sheets', 'storyboards', 'pencil', 'tests', 'character', 'designs', 'props', 'backgrounds', 'so', 'Other', 'Works', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'promo', 'did', 'MTV', 'Loaded', 'ad', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'CD', 'ROM', 'cool', 'commercial', 'Honda', 'Coupe', 'Mission.Finally', 'collection', 'Liquid', 'Television', 'Shorts', 'appeared', 'show', '90s']",N/A

But that kind of sums it up for the ""Matrix"" trilogy (+) also.The entire series in a pair of DVDs is excellent, as I could finally see it in the space of two evenings in sequence, without interruptions.  And it is disjointed and surreal enough that it deserves to be seen like this to allow the viewer get a handle on what's going on, but this is a good thing.The dark vision of Peter Chung is powerful, almost Dadaesque, but at the same time has a tempo that makes it hypnotic.  Numerous vivid vignettes in each episode stress the visual nature of the animation, but the dialog provides a unifying theme to each one and sets the rhythm that makes each story strangely compelling.The most compelling theme throughout the series is the relationship between Aeon Flux and the villain, Trevor Goodchild.  Or is he a villain?  Is he in fact a benevolent dictator trying to do the greatest good for the greatest number, and in fact Aeon Flux is a nihilistic anarchist bent on violence and destruction as an art form, or merely for its own sake?  Different episodes spin the story both ways, but regardless, it is clear that Aeon and Trevor have the consumate love/hate relationship, or possibly a lust/hate relationship.This is an absolute must for fans of Peter Chung's work, as seen in ""Animatrix"" and and ""Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury"".  Several of the voice actors were featured in this and ""Dark Fury"" and their gifts had an essential element of the flavor and power of ""Aeon Flux"".What makes this hard to rate is that it has elements of adolescent male fantasy mixed with patterns of plot that are so complicated as to seem random.  On the other hand, given that this was made for MTV, the randomness and adolesence should not be surprising.  It is sophisticated enough to inspire a serious cult following, but chaotic enough to put off many viewers that can't grasp the gestalt.Not for everyone, and definately not for children.

It was interesting because after watching every episode i always had something to think about, it was different especially now a days where everything has changed and its different to see how it was in the 90's when this first came out. To me I do believe it is a BUY, but if you cant rent it, then thats better!

Bendokus,"[30, 43]","Well, this is the last title I have been waiting for on DVD (now that Thundercats sets are coming) and frankly never thought I would EVER see this happen. I have been an Aeon Flux fan for many years and besides the original long-out-of-print DVD, the only way to get all of the episodes has been on VHS tapes. I really hope that this series gets the respectful treatment it deserves on this new set and I will update this review as soon as I get the DVDs in my hands.If you have never seen the original shorts from Mtv's Liquid Television or the longer half-hour episodes, you owe it to yourself to check them out. The storylines, atmosphere, characters, and espeically the music are all out of this world.Long live Aeon Flux!REVIEW UPDATE - 12/29/05Well, I just knew it was too good to be true.  I have no complaints with the video quality (the colors REALLY pop now, great remastering job here) or the sound quality (fantastic range, nice 5.1 mix) but WHY WHY WHY did Mr. Chung have to pull a Lucas on us and change things?  Sigh.  I have to admit that most of the new dialog pieces are actually improvements but the problem is that they stick out like a sore thumb.  John Rafter Lee's voice today does not sound anything at all like it did back when he originally voiced Trevor and his new dialog stems are jarring and obvious.  This is especially noticeable in the opening narration of ""Utopia or Deutronopia?"" - he almost sounds like a different person at times.  So if Mr. Chung wanted to add new dialog, fine, but how hard would it have been to add another audio track with the original soundtrack?  I would now rate this 2 and a half stars if I could.Harsh rating?  Yes.  However, my view on things like this is simple:  YOU DO NOT SCREW WITH GREAT ART.

This was an MTV's Liquid series that was phenomenal and became its own like ""The Head"" and ""Beavis & Butthead.""  I like Six Monkeys, The Matrix, Marcoss Plus, Transformers, but Aeon Flux was simply the most inspiring/ creative thing I ever seen.  The series is very intellectual, funny, cruel, bizarre, action pact, creative, had love, hate and sensitive at the same time.  The factitious setting is of a perverse hyper-techno future, which is grappling.  The characters are well developed even only if you see them for 2 minutes.  Characters have different philosophies about society and make no butt about it.  The chapters are either 20 min. long or a 10 min act clip.  The storyline move very fast and is very deep in underlying message.  You might have to watch some segment a couple times to finally understand the concepts and jokes.  With characters showing strong factual expression, there are some scenes where voice acting is neglected.  The dialogue is very simple, but stylist, since poetry is an element of each characters.  The artwork is bold with sharp design and every scene is very detailed.  The main character is powerful woman, with strong view of herself and her action named Aeon Flux.  It is her struggle against a power-hungry fascist Trevor Goodchild that is what most of the plots are centered around.

For mature audiences only, teen and up; Aeon Flux is out to bring down the man, and the man is Trevor.  He sits inside his home/government building, a white house type place, surrounded by a labryinth of hedges and booby-traps, just waiting to kill anyone who tries to get in!  Aeon is that skilled assassin!  However, can she take him down?  The two have an incredible dynamic I always enjoyed from the series, bumbling into sexual tension that even transformed well into the movie, but nevermind that, you'll see amazing animated scenes that were transformed onto film, but here are the original versions.  The woman who's all feet, the couple disappearing in the garden, the clones....  It all makes for amazing episode after episode, and amazes me after watching it again that they managed to fit it all into only one movie!  All the same, it also amazes me that this ""cartoon"" went away so soon after airing, it seemed it was on longer than that, but alas it was released long before its time I think, for it is one of those that speaks more to this generation than to the last.  Rewatching it over again after all these years, I understood it in a whole new way and on a whole new level.  It's a brilliant show with many depths to be uncovered, but I suppose my favorite has always been the complicated love of two that can never be together.  It's very Romeo and Juliet for they are on opposite ends, only it isn't their parent's rivaling forces, they are the heads of their own  rights.  Trevor the man in charge of everything Aeon opposes, and Aeon the rogue who is out to stop everything he is trying to do.  A very interesting dynamic indeed.  Sure they have teams behind each of them, but it makes for an interesting watch all the same.  From a futuristic perspective as well as a humanistic one.

The show is basically set in the future in another place where two countries known as Bregna and Monica are aside each other, a dictator/scientist named Trevor Goodchild wants control of both and perhaps even the world as a sexy female agent named Aeon Flux goes on many missions to defeat her enemy and lover.The Show combines ""Heavy Metal"" with James Bond and ""Blade Runner"" with some creative yet complicated storylines and some neat and weird futuristic ideas. The episodes in this 3 disc set are "" Uptopia or Dueterantopia"" about Trevor having control of Bregna as he has kinapped the president and is hiding him in a secret chamber under his bed for virtual experiments, "" Thanatophobia"" has Aeon with Trevor who both compete with each other with two different lovers from both borders then with "" A Last Time for Everything"" Trevor is experimenting on cloning techniques especially on Aeon. "" Ether Drift Thoery"" has Trevor who experiments in a special ecosystem called the Habitat which is in a ocean surrounded by paralytic fluid and Aeon wants to know what his newest experiment is, next "" The Purge"" ( my fave episode) has Aeon after a cruel fat criminal named Bambara who just has been implanted with a special robotic device that changes behavoirs of people as Aeon is assigned by a secret club to purge Bambara of his coastodian. "" The Demiurge"" has Aeon with his Monican friends on a mission to take away a box that contains a special god called the Demiurge and must send it to outer space, "" Isthmus Crypticus"" has Aeon with a friend on a mission to rescue two bird-like mutant humanoids which Trevor keeps in chambers, "" Reaziure"" deals with Aeon who must get rid of the effects of a successful mission by trying to hurt a innocent person and getting rid of a special pest. "" Chronophasia"" has Aeon who battles against Trevor in a infected underground area which includes a large mutant baby much like ""It's Alive"" ( 1974) and finally "" End Sinister"" which is the final episode has Aeon who goes after Trevor to the future and discovers that she may finally be alone with him.This 3-Disc DVD set has great picture and remastered sound with the first episode being a director's cut with a brand new voice over by John Raft Lee ( voice of Trevor Goodchild) and a new voice for President Clavius by a British sounding Bruce Willis, and there's plenty of extras for the fanboys such as a audio commentary by the creator Peter Chung with the cast and crew, the original Pilot, the original shorts, two featurettes, still galleries of art and more, other works by Peter Chung and some Liquid Television shorts.A must have for anime and adult animation fans!",5,A cult animated classic show now on DVD!!!,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,3123,"['animated', 'Sci-fi', 'epic', 'show', 'became', 'one', 'MTV', 'most', 'popular', 'shows', 'Beavis', 'Butt-Head', 'back', '90', 'originally', 'began', 'short', 'animated', 'film', 'made', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'became', 'most', 'popular', 'short', 'MTV', 'Liquid', 'Television', 'Mr.', 'Chung', 'made', 'more', 'shorts', '1995', 'decided', 'make', 'creation', 'short', 'lived', 'animated', 'series', 'gained', 'cult', 'following', 'anime', 'fans', 'animation', 'fans', 'alike', 'show', 'basically', 'set', 'future', 'place', 'where', 'two', 'countries', 'known', 'Bregna', 'Monica', 'are', 'aside', 'other', 'dictator/scientist', 'named', 'Trevor', 'Goodchild', 'control', 'perhaps', 'even', 'world', 'sexy', 'female', 'agent', 'named', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'many', 'missions', 'defeat', 'enemy', 'lover.The', 'Show', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'James', 'Bond', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'creative', 'yet', 'complicated', 'storylines', 'neat', 'weird', 'futuristic', 'ideas', 'episodes', '3', 'disc', 'set', 'are', 'Uptopia', 'Dueterantopia', 'Trevor', 'having', 'control', 'Bregna', 'kinapped', 'president', 'hiding', 'secret', 'chamber', 'bed', 'virtual', 'experiments', 'Thanatophobia', 'Aeon', 'Trevor', 'who', 'compete', 'other', 'two', 'different', 'lovers', 'borders', 'then', 'Last', 'Time', 'Everything', 'Trevor', 'experimenting', 'cloning', 'techniques', 'especially', 'Aeon.', 'Ether', 'Drift', 'Thoery', 'Trevor', 'who', 'special', 'ecosystem', 'called', 'Habitat', 'ocean', 'surrounded', 'paralytic', 'fluid', 'Aeon', 'know', 'what', 'newest', 'experiment', 'next', 'Purge', 'fave', 'episode', 'Aeon', 'cruel', 'fat', 'criminal', 'named', 'Bambara', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'implanted', 'special', 'robotic', 'device', 'behavoirs', 'people', 'Aeon', 'assigned', 'secret', 'club', 'purge', 'Bambara', 'coastodian.', 'Demiurge', 'Aeon', 'Monican', 'friends', 'mission', 'take', 'away', 'box', 'special', 'god', 'called', 'Demiurge', 'must', 'send', 'outer', 'space', 'Isthmus', 'Crypticus', 'Aeon', 'friend', 'mission', 'rescue', 'two', 'bird-like', 'mutant', 'humanoids', 'Trevor', 'chambers', 'Reaziure', 'deals', 'Aeon', 'who', 'must', 'get', 'rid', 'effects', 'successful', 'mission', 'trying', 'hurt', 'innocent', 'person', 'getting', 'rid', 'special', 'pest.', 'Chronophasia', 'Aeon', 'who', 'Trevor', 'infected', 'underground', 'area', 'large', 'mutant', 'baby', 'much', 'Alive', '1974', 'finally', 'End', 'Sinister', 'final', 'episode', 'Aeon', 'who', 'Trevor', 'future', 'discovers', 'may', 'finally', 'be', 'alone', 'him.This', '3-Disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'picture', 'remastered', 'sound', 'first', 'episode', 'being', 'director', 'cut', 'brand', 'new', 'voice', 'John', 'Raft', 'Lee', 'voice', 'Trevor', 'Goodchild', 'new', 'voice', 'President', 'Clavius', 'British', 'sounding', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'plenty', 'extras', 'fanboys', 'such', 'audio', 'commentary', 'creator', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'cast', 'crew', 'original', 'Pilot', 'original', 'shorts', 'two', 'featurettes', 'still', 'galleries', 'art', 'more', 'other', 'works', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'Liquid', 'Television', 'shorts.A', 'must', 'have', 'anime', 'adult', 'animation', 'fans']",N/A

The viewer was thrust into a world entirely different than ours, but still recognizable. We were given some characters, a plot, and no dialogue whatsoever; we had to figure out what was going on for ourselves. The big mistake, of course, is giving the characters context, giving them dialogue.

Back in '97, I had plenty of opportunities to get the now notorious out-of-print version from Tower Records for FAR less than sellers are asking now. Every weekend I'd see it, pick it up, think about how it only had some but not all of both full-length eps and Liquid TV shorts, then I'd put it back down. Eventually, I just stopped thinking about it altogether with the attitude that ""I'll get it later--it'll be there"".Fast forward a couple of years, the DVD went out-of-print and sellers were exploiting the fact by juicing buyers with exorbitant prices for the disc. Only a couple of months ago, when news of the Aeon Flux feature film and this tie-in complete collection DVD surfaced, did sellers begin lowering the prices of the out-of-print version.After heavily weighing the pros & cons of both versions, [with this set having next to none in cons, I might add] I ordered my Aeon Flux Complete Animated Collection from Amazon the day it was released (after comparing prices, of course),then received it very quickly a few days later. Thanks, Amazon. I'm still smiling over having this long-awaited collection.Because of the concern over replaced dialogue (still written by original writers and voiced by original cast) which was the original intended material but censored by MTV, there may still be a need for the out-of-print version depending on your personal preference.

169751,A13LIB4E8IKO0X,1415714169,"Sinless Knight ""S. Knight""","[9, 12]","One thing that I need to get off of my chest that has been bugging me for some times now is that: AEON FLUX IS NOT JAPANESE ANIME, it's an adult animated series.  Alot of people make the mistake of assuming that if an animated series is aimed towards adults, that it automatically accounts for it being Japanese Anime, which is absolutely not the case.  If that were so, then Heavy Metal and The Head might as well be classified as Japanese Anime.  It's not.With that cleared, let me state that this collection is truly a special treat for Flux fans.  The ten episodes from the animated series are all here & digitally remastered (with Dolby Digital 2.0 & 5.1 surround sound) with newly added dialogue on the first two discs.  For staters, Peter Chung ADDED newly recorded dialogue in order to better progress the storyline in certain areas, Chung didn't remove anything (he didn't pull a Mike Judge B&B; Vol. 1 Col) just slightly extended for the best possible sequence.  Then there's also the third disc which covers the history of Aeon Flux, including interviews with the producers & voice actors, all of the Aeon Flux shorts (including the pilot), and an overview of all of the main weapons & vehicles spotted throughout the would of Flux (brought to you by Aeon herself), not to mention sketches.  What more could a Flux fan ask for?The only real gripes with this collection:1) The commentary isn't as informative or intriguing as could be. In some areas it comes off too discreet at times, focusing too much on the technical aspects of the shots, & very little elsewhere.2) The packaging isn't as robust as could be.  It would have been excellent to have seen the futuristic Aeon Flux collection boxed into a tinfoil/plastic casing, with each disc placed in separate pouches in the same case.  Rather than each disc separately bundled together in cardboard casing.  Could have made for an ever better collectible.3) There's no Anaphormic Widescreen Feature.  While it's great that each of the ten episodes were digitally remastered for the best quality possible, it could have been even better if there were an option to watch them in widescreen for a truly enjoyable viewing experience.  The episodes are presented only in standard full frame.Other than that, this box set is a complete must-buy just for the ten episodes & shorts alone.  However, be advised that this collection (unlike the Hollywood 2005 film) is geared more towards the veteran fans of the series. Newcomers desensitized by today's standard of animated series' and franchises, may not come to like Aeon Flux (unless overly openminded).  Aeon Flux is a cult classic in which many would have had to have seen from the days of Liquid Television on MTV, to truly appreciate and love.  Peter Chung crated something truly phenomenal when having created Aeon Flux.  Some of camera shots he used, had never been seen or done in any other animated series/movie prior.

It was also original and is still ahead of it's time. The whole concept of the show is great, a world that is more corrupted and almost lifeless in the future, where a sexy mysteriously interesting female would kick your butt, for any reason.

While Aeon's many incarnations are perfectly dealt with; the inclusion of some liquid tv stuff only serves to further frustrate.  I WANT IT ALL.  I want season 1 and beyond of liquid TV.  Please please mtv, let the sales of this be enough to convince you that you must release the complete liquid television on DVD.  It was a great series of its time and i think many now would really appreciate it (think about the sales of DvDs from adult swim's line up and you get the idea you had animated TV for adults in the early 90's.  And, for the most part ther would not be an adult swim if liquid television had not existed.  Think about it.
