However, after giving it a chance with an open mind we will say will say it did grow on us. No, it doesn't follow the comic story lines. It is more of a mixture of the comic book and the movie series. The Spike character is similar to the godson character in the 90's cartoon series in his relationship with Storm. Different powers, but similar idea. The volume is still early in the series so everyone is still being introduced. The series production was pretty good. Good theme song and the character development was done well. The only thing we disliked about this disc is the fact that you have to collect 5-6 dvds to get the whole season. Too bad the series wasn't collected until the third season. We know it lets them make more money, but by now the series should have been put in a collection.",5,Better show that I first thought.,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,902,"['Being', 'fan', 'early', '90', 'X-men', 'cartoon', 'series', 'were', 'loathed', 'give', 'new', 'series', 'chance', 'However', 'giving', 'chance', 'open', 'mind', 'will', 'say', 'will', 'say', 'did', 'grow', 'No', ""n't"", 'follow', 'comic', 'story', 'lines', 'more', 'mixture', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'series', 'Spike', 'character', 'similar', 'godson', 'character', '90', 'cartoon', 'series', 'relationship', 'Storm', 'Different', 'powers', 'similar', 'idea', 'volume', 'still', 'early', 'series', 'everyone', 'still', 'being', 'introduced', 'series', 'production', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Good', 'theme', 'song', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'only', 'thing', 'disliked', 'disc', 'fact', 'have', 'collect', '5-6', 'dvds', 'get', 'whole', 'season', 'Too', 'bad', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'collected', 'third', 'season', 'know', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'now', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'collection']",X-Men Evolution - Xplosive Days VHS

575305,A1TH45SI84KQJW,B000059XY9,"Siren ""Siren""","[3, 4]","For anyone who has read the original comics and seen the original series, you will be throughly surprised by this new installment.  The bad points: Almost every X-Man and Brotherhood member is either a high school student or teacher. Mystique is the principal. Toad, Jean, Nightcrawler, Rogue, Cyclops, etc are students. Wolverine is sorta a mentor for them at Xavier's home. The school they go to is not Xavier's. It is a public high school. So they must deal with hiding their powers and looks, for some of them.  Good Points: Animation is excellent. The best I have seen in a long time. I love the way Nightcrawler looks. The stories are well written. And for the most part, they have kept the key pieces of the original stories true. Wolverine and Sabretooth having a past, Wolvering not knowing everything, Rogue/Mystique and Nightcrawler/Mystique ties. Cyclops/Jean relationship.  I am a new fan of X-Men, brought on by the hit movie and I do like this show. I am unsure whether die-hard, long-time fans are welcoming it as much. I think for the kiddie set (I am 22 years old), it's a good show and teached valuable lessons, as the comics from yester-years have taught about racisim and family.",5,Evolution is more like de-evolution,989020800,"05 5, 2001",2001,1200,"['anyone', 'who', 'read', 'original', 'comics', 'seen', 'original', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'throughly', 'surprised', 'new', 'installment', 'bad', 'points', 'Almost', 'X-Man', 'Brotherhood', 'member', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'teacher', 'Mystique', 'principal', 'Toad', 'Jean', 'Nightcrawler', 'Rogue', 'Cyclops', 'etc', 'are', 'students', 'Wolverine', 'sorta', 'mentor', 'Xavier', 'home', 'school', 'go', 'not', 'Xavier', 'public', 'high', 'school', 'must', 'deal', 'hiding', 'powers', 'Good', 'Points', 'Animation', 'excellent', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'love', 'way', 'Nightcrawler', 'stories', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'kept', 'key', 'pieces', 'original', 'stories', 'true', 'Wolverine', 'Sabretooth', 'having', 'past', 'Wolvering', 'not', 'knowing', 'everything', 'Rogue/Mystique', 'Nightcrawler/Mystique', 'ties', 'Cyclops/Jean', 'relationship', 'am', 'new', 'fan', 'X-Men', 'brought', 'hit', 'movie', 'do', 'show', 'am', 'unsure', 'die-hard', 'long-time', 'fans', 'are', 'welcoming', 'much', 'think', 'kiddie', 'set', 'am', '22', 'years', 'old', 'good', 'show', 'teached', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'comics', 'yester-years', 'have', 'taught', 'racisim', 'family']",X-Men Evolution - Xplosive Days VHS
