327586,AUTZ0XF951LZ5,6302681049,"Dasher ""marbleann""","[1, 3]","Very good mini series/movie. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs as Joe Jackson  was very underrated , his role as Joe Jackson rivals Laraunce Fishburns as Ike Turner. I think it is funny that years later Angela Basset who plays the mother in this movie plays Tina Turner with Fishburn. I wonder how she compares the 2 performances. If this was a wide release movie and  not a tv mini series  Hilton-Jacobs would of been nominated for a Oscar.Basset is just ok in this movie. She is completely overwhelmed by Hilton-Jacobs and the people who play Micheal.  And she is really a annoying character. She sits around and cries when her husband is abusing the kids. I am sure if she had left this man years earlier the chldren would of not had been as mess up as they are.  Being that Jermaine co writes this movie it is a interesting portrait he paints of his mother.  Who is a sympathetic character but at the same time a weak mother. Katherine only leaves when she over hears Joe and his girlfriend on the phone, but she stayed when he was beating and abusing the kids. You hear her yelling at Joe every once in a while but she does. It was a interesting scene when she is on the phone with Joe again mad at something and you look around the dinner table and fans are sitting there eatng dinner with the mother and the other kids.  Very weird.Margret Avery who plays her mother looks more like her sister, then her mother particulary when Katherine is a adult with children.Another intersting point about Jermaine writing this is the way he portrays his relationship to Hazel Gordy. We all knew at the time it had nothing to do with love and she was considered a very plain looking woman. It was a joke and a very opportunistic move on his part.  But in this movie you would of thought this was Romeo and Juliet romance. I have to respect that Jermaine did not tear her down. Good for him.The various performers playing the Jacksons through the years were very good but none had much to do except the the actors who played Michael who were very good. The one who played him as a adult was spot on, it was very tragic that he died soon after the movie was made. To me the one who played the second to last Michael really looked and moved like him when he was on the stage. Remember this movie is suppose to be about the original Jacksons, the ones in the hall of fame, the ones that blew the socks off of everyone when they first came on the scene, not Janet, who I thnk Michael sings for, I swear.I like the way they touch on the various rivals of the Jackson Five like the Osmonds. There a few of them like the Sylvers.  None of these rivals came close to Michael. The had a few hits but that was about it.I remember Michael when he first came on the scene. We are the same age. There has never been anyone who was like him as a child and teenage performer. And no one since.  Even now I am amazed when I see him in old footage and hear his voice. I cry looking at them because of how sad it is to see how he has fallen in the last 15 years. Prince and him are the same age look at Prince now and look at Michael. A sad story. This movie will show you when he was in his prime and it does a good job of it.",4,Hilton-Jacobs steals the movie,1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,3192,"['Very', 'good', 'mini', 'series/movie', 'Lawrence', 'Hilton', 'Jacobs', 'Joe', 'Jackson', 'was', 'very', 'underrated', 'role', 'Joe', 'Jackson', 'Laraunce', 'Fishburns', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'think', 'funny', 'years', 'later', 'Angela', 'Basset', 'who', 'mother', 'movie', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'Fishburn', 'wonder', 'how', '2', 'performances', 'was', 'wide', 'release', 'movie', 'not', 'tv', 'mini', 'series', 'Hilton-Jacobs', 'would', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar.Basset', 'just', 'ok', 'movie', 'completely', 'overwhelmed', 'Hilton-Jacobs', 'people', 'who', 'play', 'Micheal', 'really', 'annoying', 'character', 'around', 'cries', 'when', 'husband', 'abusing', 'kids', 'am', 'sure', 'had', 'left', 'man', 'years', 'earlier', 'chldren', 'would', 'not', 'had', 'been', 'mess', 'up', 'are', 'Being', 'Jermaine', 'co', 'movie', 'interesting', 'portrait', 'mother', 'Who', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'same', 'time', 'weak', 'mother', 'Katherine', 'only', 'when', 'hears', 'Joe', 'girlfriend', 'phone', 'stayed', 'when', 'was', 'beating', 'abusing', 'kids', 'hear', 'yelling', 'Joe', 'once', 'while', 'was', 'interesting', 'scene', 'when', 'phone', 'Joe', 'again', 'mad', 'something', 'look', 'dinner', 'table', 'fans', 'are', 'sitting', 'there', 'eatng', 'dinner', 'mother', 'other', 'kids', 'Very', 'weird.Margret', 'Avery', 'who', 'mother', 'more', 'sister', 'then', 'mother', 'particulary', 'when', 'Katherine', 'adult', 'children.Another', 'intersting', 'point', 'Jermaine', 'writing', 'way', 'relationship', 'Hazel', 'Gordy', 'knew', 'time', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'love', 'was', 'considered', 'very', 'plain', 'looking', 'woman', 'was', 'joke', 'very', 'opportunistic', 'move', 'part', 'movie', 'would', 'thought', 'was', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'romance', 'have', 'respect', 'Jermaine', 'did', 'not', 'tear', 'down', 'Good', 'him.The', 'various', 'performers', 'playing', 'Jacksons', 'years', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'none', 'had', 'much', 'do', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Michael', 'who', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'who', 'played', 'adult', 'was', 'spot', 'was', 'very', 'tragic', 'died', 'soon', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'one', 'who', 'played', 'second', 'last', 'Michael', 'really', 'looked', 'moved', 'when', 'was', 'stage', 'Remember', 'movie', 'suppose', 'be', 'original', 'Jacksons', 'ones', 'hall', 'fame', 'ones', 'blew', 'socks', 'everyone', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'scene', 'not', 'Janet', 'who', 'thnk', 'Michael', 'sings', 'swear.I', 'way', 'touch', 'various', 'rivals', 'Jackson', 'Five', 'Osmonds', 'few', 'Sylvers', 'None', 'rivals', 'came', 'close', 'Michael', 'had', 'few', 'hits', 'was', 'it.I', 'remember', 'Michael', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'scene', 'are', 'same', 'age', 'never', 'been', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'like', 'child', 'teenage', 'performer', 'one', 'Even', 'now', 'am', 'amazed', 'when', 'see', 'old', 'footage', 'hear', 'voice', 'cry', 'looking', 'how', 'sad', 'see', 'how', 'fallen', 'last', '15', 'years', 'Prince', 'are', 'same', 'age', 'look', 'Prince', 'now', 'look', 'Michael', 'A', 'sad', 'story', 'movie', 'will', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'prime', 'good', 'job']",The Jacksons - An American Dream VHS

327588,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6302681049,Deborah Earle,"[3, 4]","I must express the same sentiment as an earlier reviewer about my initial reluctance to view this film. At the time of its release there had been quite a bit of media focus on the Jackson Family's dysfunction, and this was the year before the first allegations of child sexual abuse were made against Michael.Around that time, the footage of the Jackson 5 performing ""Rockin' Robin"", which I most likely saw when it was new, was rebroadcast on one channel, and with the knowledge of their behind-the-scenes situation, I couldn't enjoy the performance in the way I once might have.In this 1992 portrayal of the Jackson Family, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, best remembered by me as Freddie ""Boom Boom"" Washington on ""Welcome Back Kotter"", absents himself from comedy to lead the cast as Joe Jackson, the family's tough patriarch, and Angela Bassett plays Katherine Jackson, his wife, replacing her character's soft demure quality inherited by her best-loved son, with a certain firmness.The couple, who have both shared some musical aspirations(although in this series, Katherine was training as a nurse),meet, court, and marry when Katherine becomes pregnant. They settle at 2300 Jackson Street, of all places, and begin raising a family, including their oldest daughter, Maureen Reillette known as ""Rebbie""(Monica Calhoun), Jackie(Bumper Robinson,Terrence Howard), Tito(Angel Vargas, Shakiem Evans), Jermaine(Jermaine Jackson II,Colin Steele), La Toya(Kellie Martin, Ebonie Smith), Marlon(Floyd Roger Myers Jr.,Jacen Wilkerson), their brightest and most shining star, Michael(Alex Burrall,Jason Weaver, and Wylie Draper), followed by Randy(Nicholas Phillips),and baby Janet(Maya Nichole Johnson).Much of the focus is placed on the boys of the family, as their father's musical aspirations crumble amid their struggle to make ends meet, and Katherine discovers the musical talent of her sons.  A steel mill worker,Joe begins to make sacrifices to advance his sons' musical career, and would currently be classified as a ""Tiger Dad"" as he ensures that they don't miss a beat, working with them and rehearsing them until they gradually improve.Young Alex Burrall, who plays Michael as a child is an absolutely precocious heart-stealer as he depicts the sensitivity of the group's young frontman, who wins hearts at a school talent show singing ""Climb Evr'y Mountain"", secretly keeps an illicit rat as a pet, and outruns his father when facing a spanking.Joe uses corporal punishment and cajolement to keep his kids in line,and although in reality, Katherine reportedly did as well, she is shown weeping helplessly with her children during such sessions in scenes that are difficult to watch.But in the tough neighborhood to which they were relegated due to their race, he must be credited with keeping his brood out of trouble.The boys enter and occasionally win talent shows,and soon go on the road for auditions with their father, working very late hours and sometimes in seedy locations where children should not be.But noteworthy is the fact that in a society that was only beginning to do away with the long-standing practice of segregation, African Americans would still have had fewer options as to where they would have been accepted, and they had to accept gigs wherever they could.There is one devastating incident, where during a mugging, Joe is injured and they are deprived of some of their musical equipment.But later, they still manage to play the Apollo.Ultimately, the lovely Suzanne De Passe (Vanessa Williams), a talent scout for Motown Records founder Berry Gordy(Billy Dee Williams), talks her reluctant boss, wary of the challenges in dealing with child performers, into giving them an audition. Gordy is impressed, and the clan's ascent officially begins.We follow them through their appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"", their move to California, Jermaine's romance with Berry Gordy's daughter Hazel(portrayed by a lovely hazel-eyed Monica Allison), their affiliation with mentor Diana Ross (Holly Robinson-Peete), their work in the recording studio, during which we see an apprehensive Joe viewing Berry Gordy as a rival for his sons' affections, and Jason Weaver at the center of it all as Michael at ages 9-14, engaging in pranks with Marlon,including upsetting a would-be tryst that Jermaine tried to have with a groupie, and having a nervous breakdown so profound, he is reluctant to get on another plane during a tour,but still shining once onstage.Tito, in the meantime, has fallen in love with a girl named Dee Dee (Elizabeth Narvaez), which like Jermaine's relationship with Hazel is much to his father's disapproval.By the mid-seventies,Tito has married Dee Dee, Jermaine has married Hazel, and the brothers, except for Jermaine, sever their contract with Motown.In a prelude to his own sudden sunset,the talented and promising Wylie Draper,whose doe-eyed vulnerability expresses the beautiful wistfulness of the man he portrayed,and who danced with Michael in his short film for the song, ""Remember the Time"", captures the soft voice and gentle nature as well as the strength of the pop star from his late teens through his early 20s,getting the dance moves from the Robot to the Moonwalk down pat, lamenting severe acne and the perceived hideousness that would later drive him to multiple plastic surgeries, feeling the pressure of trying to live up to public expectations, but still giving his all when he appears onstage. The two main crises of the family during the ""Thriller"" era are Katherine's confirmation of Joe's infidelity, which drives her to spend time with her mother(Margaret Avery), and later, Michael's suffering 2nd and 3rd degree burns while filming a Pepsi Commercial.Had there been a more in-depth depiction of that crisis, it might have been noted that Michael, bandaged head and all, still visited other patients in that ward who were worse off than he was( and had done so even before being a patient there), and as is well-known, donated the money from his settlement with Pepsi to the burn unit that treated him.As he recovers, he spends time with his menagerie, including pet snake, Muscles, and pet chimp, Bubbles.The Encino home is a reserve for the many animals Michael rescued.At the end the boys are still performing together, and we leave them onstage during their 1984 Victory Tour, as Michael addresses the crowd, reviewing how far they have come, and somewhat ironically in hindsight, vowing not to be beaten down by fame.Wylie Draper would lose his life to a rare form of leukemia at the age of 24, a year after this miniseries aired. But this was his moment, and he made the most of it.In the end, fans must echo back the sentiment of the brothers to their fans: ""We thank you for the joy you have given us! We thank you!""",4,Compelling Family Saga,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,6787,"['must', 'express', 'same', 'sentiment', 'earlier', 'reviewer', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'view', 'film', 'time',

327600,A99NZX4ACZXF3,6302681049,Mack E. Tan,"[6, 7]","Joe Jackson had dreams as a young man.  He wanted to be a boxer and musician and go to California.  But he got his girlfriend, Katherine, pregnant and he did the honorable thing--he married her.  He tabled his dreams for his family, working in the steel mills of Gary, Indiana, to put foood on the table.  A religious and principled man (the Jacksons were Jehovah Witnesses), he took family seriously and since he didn't believe in birth control or abortion, he had a lot of kids--9 altogether.  On occasion he was brutal--but if any of you are parents, can you imagine how brutal you might get having 10 people depending on you?Gossip and badmouthing from the kids paint Joe Jackson as a tyrant--and he may have some very large flaws--but one thing is very clear:  he never abandoned his family.  He transformed his dreams to fit the talent of his children and took all of them out of a probable bleak destiny in Gary to the height of world recognition.  I'm amazed by that, frankly.This movie is definitely worth watching for many reasons.  Though poor, this was a close knit family smothered in love and support by both parents.  Angela Bassett is touching as usual, all mothery and love, but able to stand up to Joe when he gets a little too tough with the boys. Her children are still devoted to her.  Lawrence Tillman as Joe Jackson gives a multi-dimensioned father.  Proud of his children, a stern taskmaster, a visionary--as much a visionary as Berry Gordy--a family man who is complex and flawed.  I loved the scene at the Apollo where he embraces Michael and gets off to his children performing Twist and Shout.  We also see the music business during the Motown Age and the inner workings of Berry Gordy's Motown at the height of its success.  Now Billy Dee Williams gives Gordy way too much sex appeal...but I enjoyed the charm anyway.The boy who played preteen Michael was simply adorable and highly talented as singer and dancer.  His singing of Kansas City and Twist and Shout in the first half had me moving.  The second half, when the family is breaking up as Michael's star ascends was somewhat painful.  The father loses control over his creation, Hollywood values destroy family unity, Katherine suffers from empty nest.  But what an achievement.I loved the fact that this is 4 hours long--it's like a good book you don't want to end.  No doubt this story will be retold in fuller detail, but I suspect that story would take 8 hours.

The kids get into music (and into some occasional trouble) during their childhood years (they get signed on to the Motown label before the end of the 60s, and a couple of the boys would change labels by the late 70s). Part 2 of the movie starts in 1970, when their song ""ABC"" became a smash hit and ends into the early 80s around the time of their famous ""Victory Tour"" and of Michael Jackson's solo career (though there is little seen of this; the group's string of hits had stopped around the mid 70s after ""Dancing Machine"" came out).

327606,A1EYWOPY4BP7Z5,6302681049,"Quincy Xavier ""baldbro""","[14, 19]","The Jackson Five (circa late 60s/early 70s) was arguably the best group to come out of Motown, and this video, originally an ABC miniseries, attempts to chronicle the life and times of one of the most talented and most  dysfunctional families in show business.One of the film's strongest  points is its treatment of the patriarch Joseph Jackson, played by Lawrence  Hilton-Jacobs.  Often characterized as a monster in real life (especially  by daughter LaToya), Joseph seems more realistic here as the stern father  determined to see his sons realize the dream of musical success he was  never able to achieve.  While some of his actions seem cruel (like not  allowing the boys to attend sister Rebbie's wedding because they had a  gig), some are not that bad (like have the boys pile the bricks from  frontyard to backyard).It is sometime confusing, because each of the  five members of the group (six, if you count Randy) are portrayed by 2 to 3  different actors as the characters age.  Some are believable, excellent  actors (like Bumper Robinson as the first Jackie), some are HORRIBLE actors  (like whoever played Jermaine as he was leaving the group).  But  UNQUESTIONABLY, the best of all the brothers was Jason Weaver (who later  starred in &quot;Thea&quot; and now plays Marcus on &quot;Smart Guy&quot;).  He was the second Michael, the Michael from the &quot;I Want You  Back&quot;/&quot;ABC&quot;/&quot;I'll Be There&quot; days.  Weaver, who is  a talenter singer and dancer in own right, makes you believe that he is an  11 year-old Michael Jackson, and the early Motown scenes seem to revolve  around him; you can't wait for him to perform again, USING HIS OWN  VOICE(!!!) in many of the scenes.BEST SCENCE IN THE ENTIRE FILM: The  Jackson 5 at the Apollo theater on Amateur Night, performing the Isley  Brothers' &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;.  You'll be on your feet  shouting!But, having said all of that, the weak acting and flimsy script  in the later scenes take a lot away from the film.  Sadly, Angela Bassett  is wasted in the role of mother Katherine Jackson (although she had done  &quot;Boyz N the Hood&quot; at this point, this was LONG before  &quot;What's Love Got to Do With It&quot; or &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;,  her two best roles) Additionally, someone had the silly idea of casting  Holly Robinson Peete as Diana Ross, and Billy Dee Williams as Berry Gordy.  While they are both great actors, they are miscast and sorely unbelievable  in these roles.Finally, how can you chronicle the tale of the Jackson  FAMILY all the way into the late 80s without giving serious attention to  JANET??

327614,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,6302681049,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[45, 48]","""The Jacksons - An American Dream"" was very enjoyable to watch, although those of us who grew up with the Jackson 5 know that there was a LOT left out and several inaccuracies in the script. But perhaps the things that were hinted at or weren't mentioned at all in the movie is what made the biggest impression. It isn't necessary to get into all of the scenarios that were missed, but I will say this movie did well to give you a very general understanding of just what Michael, Marlon, Jermaine, Tito, Jackie, and later on, Randy Jackson went through on the road to fame and during the height of their popularity. IMO, the reason Papa Joe Jackson (played excellently by Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs) worked his kids so hard is because he himself was an unsuccessful musician, and wanted a better future for them. Now I absolutely do not condone the harsh methods he used to discipline his children - but I do understand it.Now on to the movie...The beginning, which concentates on the life of the young Katherine growing up in Chicago, drags a bit. But it's after the kids are born when the story starts to get interesting. Angela Bassett is effective in her role as the family matriarch, Katherine Jackson, but I've seen Angela in much stronger roles and being cast as the long-suffering wife of Joe Jackson didn't really suit her. But given the material she had to work with, she did a fine job.The rest of the cast was alright - worth noting are Billy Dee Williams as Motown founder Berry Gordy; Vanessa L. Williams as Berry's protege Suzanne dePasse; Bumper Robinson and Terence Howard, who both played oldest brother Jackie but at different ages; and the son of the real Jermaine Jackson, Jermaine II, playing his father as a teenager - however, who had the horrendous idea of casting Holly Robinson as Diana Ross?! Ugh. She was totally unconvincing and almost laughable. The kids, who were mostly unknowns, were pretty much on point, especially the talented Jason Weaver as the pre-teen Michael (he gives a dead-on performance in this role); the late Wylie Draper, who played the adult Michael; and the actor who portrayed the adult Jermaine, Colin Steele. Their performances were among the best in the film.I would like to address a couple of remarks that some previous reviewers brought up: WHEN was it implied that Joe Jackson was having an affair with Suzanne dePasse? That must be something I missed, because nothing like that was ever even hinted at. Joe did have a mistress, but it was NOT Ms. dePasse. Also, this was supposed to be the story of the Jackson 5, NOT Janet or Latoya Jackson, so this is why they were barely mentioned...and that suited me just fine. Overall, this is a good film to sit back and enjoy on a Sunday afternoon, although there were parts that were a bit corny, like the constant mention of getting to California being the measure of success in Joe and Katherine's eyes. But Jackson fans are sure to love it and will definitely want to make it part of their collection.",4,"Has its faults, but still manages to hold your attention",1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,3003,"['Jacksons', 'American', 'Dream', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Jackson', '5', 'know', 'was', 'LOT', 'left', 'out', 'several', 'inaccuracies', 'script', 'perhaps', 'things', 'were', 'hinted', 'were', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'movie', 'what', 'made', 'biggest', 'impression', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'get', 'scenarios', 'were', 'missed', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'did', 'well', 'give', 'very', 'general', 'understanding', 'just', 'what', 'Michael', 'Marlon', 'Jermaine', 'Tito', 'Jackie', 'later', 'Randy', 'Jackson', 'went', 'road', 'fame', 'height', 'popularity', 'IMO', 'reason', 'Papa', 'Joe', 'Jackson', 'played', 'excellently', 'Lawrence', 'Hilton-Jacobs', 'worked', 'kids', 'so', 'hard', 'was', 'unsuccessful', 'musician', 'wanted', 'better', 'future', 'Now', 'absolutely', 'do', 'not', 'condone', 'harsh', 'methods', 'used', 'discipline', 'children', 'do', 'understand', 'it.Now', 'movie', 'beginning', 'life', 'young', 'Katherine', 'growing', 'up', 'Chicago', 'bit', 'kids', 'are', 'born', 'when', 'story', 'get', 'interesting', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'effective', 'role', 'family', 'matriarch', 'Katherine', 'Jackson', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Angela', 'much', 'stronger', 'roles', 'being', 'cast', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Joe', 'Jackson', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'suit', 'given', 'material', 'had', 'work', 'did', 'fine', 'job.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'alright', 'worth', 'noting', 'are', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'Motown', 'founder', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'Vanessa', 'L.', 'Williams', 'Berry', 'protege', 'Suzanne', 'dePasse', 'Bumper', 'Robinson', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'who', 'played', 'oldest', 'brother', 'Jackie', 'different', 'ages', 'son', 'real', 'Jermaine', 'Jackson', 'Jermaine', 'II', 'playing', 'father', 'teenager', 'however', 'who', 'had', 'horrendous', 'idea', 'casting', 'Holly', 'Robinson', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Ugh', 'was', 'totally', 'unconvincing', 'almost', 'laughable', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'point', 'especially', 'talented', 'Jason', 'Weaver', 'pre-teen', 'Michael', 'dead-on', 'performance', 'role', 'late', 'Wylie', 'Draper', 'who', 'played', 'adult', 'Michael', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'adult', 'Jermaine', 'Colin', 'Steele', 'performances', 'were', 'best', 'film.I', 'would', 'like', 'address', 'couple', 'remarks', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'brought', 'up', 'WHEN', 'was', 'implied', 'Joe', 'Jackson', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'Suzanne', 'dePasse', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'missed', 'nothing', 'was', 'ever', 'even', 'hinted', 'Joe', 'did', 'have', 'mistress', 'was', 'NOT', 'Ms.', 'dePasse', 'Also', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'story', 'Jackson', '5', 'NOT', 'Janet', 'Latoya', 'Jackson', 'why', 'were', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'suited', 'just', 'fine', 'Overall', 'good', 'film', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'were', 'parts', 'were', 'bit', 'corny', 'constant', 'mention', 'getting', 'California', 'being', 'measure', 'success', 'Joe', 'Katherine', 'eyes', 'Jackson', 'fans', 'are', 'sure', 'love', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'make', 'part', 'collection']",The Jacksons - An American Dream VHS

327617,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,6302681049,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[1, 1]","The Jacksons: An American Dream was a mini-series that aired in late 1992 and was quite successful, it was a fantastic look into the Jackson family and Michael Jackson's early years. Years later it remains the best  and most well executed ""documentary"" on Michael Jackson and his family because the heart was at the right place, the actors did have some talent (Jermaine Jackson is played by none other than his son Jermaine Jr.) and the story is the closest depiction the actual story we've had thus far . An American Dream is in linear fashion from the meeting of Joseph and Katherine Jackson up until the brothers' last tour with Michael, the Victory tour in 1984 with no interruption or flashback. It's not actually a documentary but it's more of a telling of the events as a movie, that's how I think most would see it.Was happy to see this series being released on DVD at a reasonable price as the VHS collections can sell for insane prices on the internet. I was too young when the mini-series aired to watch it or even know who the Jackson family was unfortunately but I had much pleasure viewing this. Right from the beginning with Joe Jackson meeting Katherine I had a feeling that this mini-series was done right. Watching the events as they unfolded you can't help but be into it and you want to find out what happens next, you're into it, you're hooked and you know it. The best part is even if you're not a fan or aren't familiar with the family the chances are very high that you would still be captivated and thus enjoy it. I honestly believe anyone could like it. Watching Joe discipline his boys and turn them into the performers that they became, one can argue with his method but there was certain smarts to him, he was the one who made way for it to happen and recognized talent in his sons. We sympathize with all the boys as they are being disciplined at the hand of Joseph in ways that most of us can't imagine doing today (we don't see a lot of violent acts except one scene with a whip I can recall, but still). It's a fantastic transition we get to watch the Jacksons as children grow into teenagers (complete with a Michael with acne who hated his appearance and his nose) and finally, young men. I don't think any events were dragged too long as some others have mentioned, I think all that was included deserved/needed to be included.The actors all did a solid job, even with the changes in actors for the brothers as they got older it doesn't lose a thing. Even the surrounding cast members, Barry Gordy, Jermaine's wife Hazel and everyone else was good more so considering this wasn't an actual movie. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Angela Bassett as Joseph and Katherine respectively were superb in their job, and displayed a lot of emotions and I thought had resemblance to them. Joseph especially I thought was right on and it's hard to imagine someone doing better at portraying him. The daughters, with the exception of Rebbie get very little and close to no airtime in the movie at all, I don't think there was any harm meant but this was clearly focused on Michael and his brothers which is why we see little of them. Wylie Draper as an adult Michael stands out, during the now legendary 25th anniversary performance he was a fantastic imitator, he looked the part and he has the moves. It's a shame that he passed away a year later, he would have been excellent had there been a continuation on this (technically Man In The Mirror was ""supposed"" to be the follow and it picks up right where this left off, but other than for a laugh it offers little and is dreaded the vast majority of the fans). One of the best parts of the mini-series is that there are performances (and they are very well done, close to the actual thing) along with the real music. It would've been dull if there were no performance and music, I'm glad they able do them here.There are certain incorrect facts, such as Joseph and Katherine meeting in 1945 when in reality they met in 1947. Or Michael being born a year later, 1959 instead of 1958. Or Michael being seen recording the song ""Human Nature"" for the Thriller album in the studio in 1983 which is incorrect since Thriller was released in 1982. But you know what? Those are little details and factual errors probably only the real hardcore Michael Jackson and Jackson 5 fans will notice, besides they have everything else right and those 5 hours represent one of the best music films I have seen being fairly accurate and highly entertaining at the same time. Of course there are little things that aren't what actually happened  but the heart is at the right place and I can't fault this mini-series for anything but giving me a good time and at the same time understanding the family a little more.
