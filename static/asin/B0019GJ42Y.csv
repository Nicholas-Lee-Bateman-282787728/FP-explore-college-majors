1163421,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0019GJ42Y,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","Set in the U.K. but based on Sly Stallone's Rambo character of the U.S., SON OF RAMBOW (yes, that's with a ""w"") is a heartwarming tale of friendship surrounding two characters' love of film and film making.These two are Will Proudfoot (Bill Milner) and Lee Carter (Will Poulter), two pre-teens with significantly different backgrounds. Bill has a rigid religious family that doesn't allow him to watch the tele. While Will is a roughshod kid who has to take care of his family and family's business while trying to be a kid. Will is carefree and rebellious while Bill is reserved. But once the two meet, changes rapidly ensue. Bill has the chance to see his first action film (RAMBO) and this sets him on a path more toward Will. But Will sees in Bill the carefulness that he lacks ...and an actor for his film. Changes to the film are forced onto Will as Bill's infatuation with anything Rambo come full-on. New actors and actresses from their school sign on (including a French foreign exchange student that the girls are all in lust with) and this drives a wedge between Bill's desire to see an authentic kids film and Will's need to keep the production hush-hush due to family problems.Surrounding the film's production are the religious connotations that are forced onto Bill by his mother and a man courting his mother who sees Bill's rebelliousness as a sign of weakness and ungodliness. Will's family business (an elder care home) comes into play in funny and poignant ways: using the elderly in hilarious skits for the film, and trying to maintain the place through Will's mother's absence and his brother's neglect.The school the two attend also plays a vital part in the story. It is where Will and Bill meet, discovering that each has very little in common but eventually learning to share their differences and come together as friends. Schoolmates who learn about the film build bigger and brighter sets, even going so far as to find a beat-up old vehicle to drive in one of the hysterically funny chase scenes.The script is sheer genius, with plenty to think about and tickle your funny bone. The two relative unknowns in the title performances are excellent young actors and will make you stand up and cheer for them in the end. Director/writer Garth Jennings is probably better known for his directing ofThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy(2005) but, believe me, this one will outlast it in terms of memorability.",5,"Funny, Poignant, Memorable",1273363200,"05 9, 2010",2010,2431,"['Set', 'U.K.', 'based', 'Sly', 'Stallone', 'Rambo', 'character', 'U.S.', 'SON', 'OF', 'RAMBOW', 'yes', 'w', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'friendship', 'surrounding', 'two', 'characters', 'love', 'film', 'film', 'making.These', 'two', 'are', 'Will', 'Proudfoot', 'Bill', 'Milner', 'Lee', 'Carter', 'Will', 'Poulter', 'two', 'pre-teens', 'significantly', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'Bill', 'rigid', 'religious', 'family', ""n't"", 'allow', 'watch', 'tele', 'Will', 'roughshod', 'kid', 'who', 'take', 'care', 'family', 'family', 'business', 'trying', 'be', 'kid', 'Will', 'carefree', 'rebellious', 'Bill', 'reserved', 'once', 'two', 'meet', 'changes', 'rapidly', 'ensue', 'Bill', 'chance', 'see', 'first', 'action', 'film', 'RAMBO', 'path', 'more', 'Will', 'Will', 'Bill', 'carefulness', 'actor', 'film', 'Changes', 'film', 'are', 'forced', 'onto', 'Will', 'Bill', 'infatuation', 'anything', 'Rambo', 'come', 'full-on', 'New', 'actors', 'actresses', 'school', 'sign', 'including', 'French', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'student', 'girls', 'are', 'lust', 'wedge', 'Bill', 'desire', 'see', 'authentic', 'kids', 'film', 'Will', 'need', 'keep', 'production', 'hush-hush', 'due', 'family', 'problems.Surrounding', 'film', 'production', 'are', 'religious', 'connotations', 'are', 'forced', 'Bill', 'mother', 'man', 'courting', 'mother', 'who', 'Bill', 'rebelliousness', 'sign', 'weakness', 'ungodliness', 'Will', 'family', 'business', 'elder', 'care', 'home', 'play', 'funny', 'poignant', 'ways', 'using', 'elderly', 'hilarious', 'skits', 'film', 'trying', 'maintain', 'place', 'Will', 'mother', 'absence', 'brother', 'neglect.The', 'school', 'two', 'attend', 'also', 'vital', 'part', 'story', 'where', 'Will', 'Bill', 'meet', 'discovering', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'eventually', 'learning', 'share', 'differences', 'come', 'together', 'friends', 'Schoolmates', 'who', 'learn', 'film', 'build', 'bigger', 'brighter', 'sets', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'find', 'beat-up', 'old', 'vehicle', 'drive', 'one', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'chase', 'scenes.The', 'script', 'sheer', 'genius', 'plenty', 'think', 'tickle', 'funny', 'bone', 'two', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'title', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'young', 'actors', 'will', 'make', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer', 'end', 'Director/writer', 'Garth', 'Jennings', 'probably', 'better', 'known', 'directing', 'ofThe', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', '2005', 'believe', 'one', 'will', 'outlast', 'terms', 'memorability']",Son of Rambow anglais

1163423,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B0019GJ42Y,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[0, 0]","This is a slight and rather endearing little movie - which I do not ever remember seeing or hearing anything about - was in limited release in the United States early this year, and until release on DVD was apparently mostly to be seen at a scattering of film festivals. It is a joint project of Garth Jennings and Will Goldsmith, who are mostly famed for ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". A story more unlike ""Hitchhiker could not be imagined. ""Rambow"" is a gentle, humorous tale of two English schoolboys in the early 1980s, complete opposites but unlikely friends, united alike in their love of the action hero John Rambo and determined to make their own movie based on the adventures of the character.Both are fatherless; Lee Carter (Will Poulter) is the worst-behaving boy in school, an almost-bully living in a chaotic house with his older brother, who is running a video piracy scheme and has access to a wide array of cameras and video equipment. Will Proudfoot (Bill Milner) is timid and shy, whose widowed mother belongs to the strict Plymouth Brethren, a denomination so rigorous that he is now allowed to watch television or the movies - and must leave his classroom and wait in the hallway whenever one of his teachers shows an educational film. Lee and Will meet in the hallway and become fast friends through their determination to complete their movie and enter it in a young filmmaker's competition.And so they do, fearlessly duplicating stunts and sets, props and costumes, aided and sometimes hindered by their families and schoolmates. The flamboyant French exchange student, Didier (Jules Sitruk) - who is distinguished by his impossibly high-piled pompadour and bright magenta pointy-toe boots - unexpectedly comes through at the last moment as a fellow Rambo fan, and there is a very funny and slapstick moment involving a life-sized statue of a dog attached to a high-flying kite, a second story window, a hot-tempered teacher and a pair of manicure scissors.One caveat to be noted; although this move is about schoolboys, it may not, strictly speaking be a movie which children of the age of Lee and Will would enjoy unreservedly. It seems to be oriented more towards adults, recalling what it was like to be a child.Extras include the usual ""Making of-"" documentary, commentaries by the director, producer and cast members, as well as the original inspiration for ""Son of Rambow"" - Garth Jenning's  home-made short ""Aron"", with an all star cast of his friends and sibs, filmed on location in an assortment of back yards, front yards and garden sheds.""Son of Rambow"" is highly recommended as a good family movie - that is, a move which a family can watch and enjoy all together.",4,A Slight and Endearing Little Movie,1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,2705,"['slight', 'rather', 'endearing', 'little', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'ever', 'remember', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'anything', 'was', 'limited', 'release', 'United', 'States', 'early', 'year', 'release', 'DVD', 'was', 'apparently', 'mostly', 'be', 'seen', 'scattering', 'film', 'festivals', 'joint', 'project', 'Garth', 'Jennings', 'Will', 'Goldsmith', 'who', 'are', 'mostly', 'famed', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'story', 'more', 'Hitchhiker', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'imagined', 'Rambow', 'gentle', 'humorous', 'tale', 'two', 'English', 'schoolboys', 'early', '1980s', 'complete', 'opposites', 'unlikely', 'friends', 'united', 'alike', 'love', 'action', 'hero', 'John', 'Rambo', 'determined', 'make', 'own', 'movie', 'based', 'adventures', 'character.Both', 'are', 'fatherless', 'Lee', 'Carter', 'Will', 'Poulter', 'worst-behaving', 'boy', 'school', 'almost-bully', 'living', 'chaotic', 'house', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'running', 'video', 'piracy', 'scheme', 'access', 'wide', 'array', 'cameras', 'video', 'equipment', 'Will', 'Proudfoot', 'Bill', 'Milner', 'timid', 'shy', 'widowed', 'mother', 'belongs', 'strict', 'Plymouth', 'Brethren', 'denomination', 'so', 'rigorous', 'now', 'allowed', 'watch', 'television', 'movies', 'must', 'leave', 'classroom', 'wait', 'hallway', 'whenever', 'one', 'teachers', 'educational', 'film', 'Lee', 'Will', 'meet', 'hallway', 'become', 'fast', 'friends', 'determination', 'complete', 'movie', 'enter', 'young', 'filmmaker', 'competition.And', 'do', 'fearlessly', 'duplicating', 'stunts', 'sets', 'props', 'costumes', 'aided', 'sometimes', 'hindered', 'families', 'schoolmates', 'flamboyant', 'French', 'exchange', 'student', 'Didier', 'Jules', 'Sitruk', 'who', 'distinguished', 'impossibly', 'high-piled', 'pompadour', 'bright', 'magenta', 'pointy-toe', 'boots', 'unexpectedly', 'last', 'moment', 'fellow', 'Rambo', 'fan', 'very', 'funny', 'slapstick', 'moment', 'involving', 'life-sized', 'statue', 'dog', 'attached', 'high-flying', 'kite', 'second', 'story', 'window', 'hot-tempered', 'teacher', 'pair', 'manicure', 'scissors.One', 'caveat', 'be', 'noted', 'move', 'schoolboys', 'may', 'not', 'strictly', 'speaking', 'be', 'movie', 'children', 'age', 'Lee', 'Will', 'would', 'enjoy', 'unreservedly', 'be', 'oriented', 'more', 'towards', 'adults', 'recalling', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'child.Extras', 'include', 'usual', 'Making', 'of-', 'documentary', 'commentaries', 'director', 'producer', 'cast', 'members', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'inspiration', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'Garth', 'Jenning', 'home-made', 'short', 'Aron', 'star', 'cast', 'friends', 'sibs', 'filmed', 'location', 'assortment', 'back', 'yards', 'front', 'yards', 'garden', 'sheds', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'highly', 'recommended', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'move', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'together']",Son of Rambow anglais
1163424,A1MMO3T0I18PFW,B0019GJ42Y,Chris Roberts,"[0, 0]","I had no idea what to expect when I started watching ""Son of Rambow,"" but am happy to say that I got much more than I expected.  A touching little coming-of-age story about friendship and loyalty that makes you chuckle along the way and root for that awkward little kid in all of us.The Good: Adorable lead cast - particularly Will Poulter does a fantastically mature job creating a sympathetic character with true feelings and realism.  The film has a light, wonderful, and adventurous spirit like The Goonies with a deeper sense of friendships and relationships like The Outsiders.  It's all wrapped up in a thick layer of 80's nostalgia that works pretty well.  There are some very cute moments that cause you to giggle and they're played out with subtlety and charm.  The camera-work and audio are first-rate, the sets are spot-on, and the use of animation to portray the child's imagination is done well.  The skillful way that such a charming little tale is all based on Rambo shows the cleverness and thought behind it.The Bad: Jessica Hynes as the mother just never worked.  The script hinted at inner turmoil and struggle, but the actress played it entirely one-dimensionally.  She nullified the effectiveness of most of her scenes.  There was a brief couple minutes involving a teacher shoving a pair of scissors up his nose that did not work at all and shouldn't have made it past the editing room.  Like most films set in the 70s or 80s, nobody really looks like anybody looked in the 70s or 80s.The Verdict: It would be very hard to not enjoy this film.  I think anyone from 12-70 years of age would enjoy watching it with the widest appeal to those of us who were kids in the early 80s.  If you're looking for a light, funny, coming-of-age drama, you can't go wrong with Son of Rambow.

This is a sweet, endearingcomedy about boyhood, friendship, and the joys of filmmaking. Will(Bill Milner), a lonely boy who spends most of his free time drawing elaborate adventure stories, meets up with school bullyLee Carter (Will Poulter), a felonious little thug whose onlynon-criminal activity is his amateur film project. Discovering Will's vivid illustrations, he strongs-arms Will into collaboratingwith him on his movie, an ambitious sequel to the ""Rambo"" series.Their efforts to complete this epic make for some genuinely hilarious episodes, while at the same time their growing friendshipgives this film some truly touching moments.Not only is this film funny and moving, it's also intelligentlydone and doesn't resort to the kind of crude would-be humor typicalof most recent comedies; despite centering on the world of pre-adolescent boys, there's not a hint of the kind of vulgarity that'sassumed to be popular with that age group--no cheap jokes aboutflatulence or other bodily functions, puerile sexual humor, etc.The friendship of the boys is handled well, too, without any forcedsentiment or insincere emotions. This movie would be ideal for nearly any age group.The DVD includes some wonderfully funny commentary featuring director Garth Jennings and the two young stars.

Both main characters displayed some of the valued characteristics of boyhood. Imagination, playfulness, innocence, adorableness, mischievous behavior, and the need for love and guidance.The film's excellent character development is what makes this movie great. You really start to care about the boys while watching this movie. You can see how their parenting or lack of parenting affected their social development and you begin to empathize with them as the movie plays out. I agree with another poster who wrote that the trouble-making boy, Lee Carter, was hard to like at first however as the movie went on and you began to understand him, he was easy to love. By the end of the movie, my heart went out to him even more than the other child who was easy to like. What's sad is that there are many kids out in the world just like him and they never find someone to bond to in regards to friendship and family. This movie shows the power of friendship and family.I recommend this movie greatly, however, the viewer must have an opened mind when viewing it.

1163427,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0019GJ42Y,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","It is England, probably ca. 1983, and poor little Will Proudfoot (a wonderful Bill Milner) from a religious family nurtures big dreams, and an intensely creative artistic vision. He fills his notebook with incredible animations and illustrated story plots. He is quiet and isolated, because his people are Plymouth Brethren (Exclusive, much like the Amish only very English). He also has an endearing, goofy innocence that really shines.Into his life trips the brazen, crack shot Lee Carter (impish Will Poulter), a nasty little shoplifting troublemaker. Through their shared school and an equal desire to make a RAMBO film of their own (inspired by FIRST BLOOD, 1982), they become blood brothers and begin shooting their film. Anxious to get it submitted to the children's ""Screen Test"" film competition, Lee gets his big brother's videocam and the boys get to filming.The title's ""Rambow"" comes from Will's misspelling, which they keep as their film's working title, ""Son of Rambow"". (I was especially smitten with their interpretation of the dreadful performance Richard Crenna gave in FIRST BLOOD as Rambo's mentor and teacher, Lt. Col. Trautman. Funny!)Things get even stranger and funnier as visiting French students arrive to attend the school for a period, which introduces the boys to Didier (an incredibly charismatic Jules Sitruk). Slightly over-grown Didier is the coolest thing these English kids have ever seen. When the masculine French womanizer (yes, he's their age) discovers a film is being made, he arranges to be in it by frightening Will with an audition: a horrendously funny interpretation of Patrick Swayze.This fantastically funny, heartwarming film is one of the best I've seen. It is probably the best kids' film I've ever seen in my life. The adults are virtually nonexistent but they have substance when they do appear. The comedy is 100% driven by the talent of these children; I almost fell off the couch laughing at their antics.The direction and cinematography is sophisticated yet simple; the soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in many a year. There isn't a swear word from start to finish, and these kids are some of the best entertainment to be seen anywhere. It is a pity Britain did not catch this genre sooner--America's been doing this for decades--but they've hit the nail on the head with this and outstripped anything we've done here.Stick with this film for the surprises, little homages and tear-inducing scenes. Also watch out for the incredibly cool nostalgic moments with the 1980s songs, clothes and gadgets. Seeing young Didier when he first steps off the bus will bring it all back to you in a moment (assuming you are old enough).It doesn't seem to me you have to be anyone in particular to be drawn to this film, or to enjoy it thoroughly--I say this since one reviewer seemed puzzled by the question.

However, once it does, it becomes a touching film about friendship, imagination, and youth. The movie features two boys, one from a broken family and another from an ultra-religious one. The boys, and odd couple, decide to make an amateur movie based onRambo. However, they face a whole host of problems, from jealous students to religious fundamentalists. Through these ups and downs, the boys develop a strong and truly touching bond.I've noticed that a lot of the reviewers on this site thought this film was funny. While the movie has some funny scenes, it's certainly not a comedy. I particularly thought the personality cult around the French student Didier was hilarious.

You don't like very many people at first, and it looks like it is going to be a much darker film than it turns out to be.  Stick with it, I promise it is going to get better.2.  The portrayal of the Plymouth Brethren is a bit on the dour side-  I'm not Brethren, but I can't imagine it's as bad as all that.The rest of the movie is pitch perfect.  The portrayal of a friendship between two young boys has rarely been better done.  I was just a bit younger than the kids in this movie in the mid eighties, and spent that time bouncing back and forth between England and the US.  This movie was a  bit of a nostalgia trip.

1163431,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B0019GJ42Y,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[7, 7]","I was a big fan of first-time filmmakers Hammer and Tongs' (Garth Jennings and Nick Goldsmith) Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. While the duo had worked on music videos and other film projects before Hitchhiker's, this adaptation of the iconic sci-fi novel was their first feature film. It was surprising that they were given the keys to such a big project, one that had been in development for decades, but Hammer and Tongs handled the material quite admirably. In order to make Hitchhiker's Guide they had to put another film they were developing on hold.  That project would eventually become their second feature film: Son of Rambow.Son of Rambow tells the story of Will (Bill Milner), whose family is a part of a strict religious sect known as the Plymouth Brethren. Will has never watched TV, and even has to leave the classroom when they show a documentary at his school. That's how he meets Lee (Will Poulter), the class troublemaker. Will and Lee become best friends and, through Lee, Will gets his first taste of film in the form of Rambo: First Blood. Lee recruits Will to play a stunt man in a Rambo film he's creating to enter into Screen Test's Young Filmmaker's Competition.Son of Rambow is, for the most part, a love song to film in general.  In a way it kind of reminds me of Michel Gondry's Be Kind Rewind (a film I highly recommend), but there's a very important difference. Rambow will take you back to a time that you most likely will not remember: a time when movies were still magical. These days movies are so commonplace that we never truly get excited about what's on screen, and most of us don't know what it's like to see a movie for the first time. Through the eyes of Will we get to feel what that experience is like.Rambow is also a coming-of-age story; a look back at a time when innocence is lost. At the beginning of the film, Will doesn't really know the difference between his world as a member of the Plymouth Brethren and the outside world, while Lee doesn't have the connection of a close friend, or really anyone for that matter. Throughout the course of the film we watch as the connection between the two boys develops and takes each of them on a voyage of discovery. Son of Rambow is really a brilliant look back at what it's like to be a kid, allowing you to feel the joys and the pains of early adolescence.If you haven't seen Son of Rambow, watch it today! It's really amazing how the film allows you to experience what these characters feel and see. You'll feel like a kid again, seeing film through new eyes and re-experiencing childhood. If you want to check out a not-so-jaded look at love of cinema be sure to give this a try. If anything the screening of the actual Son of Rambow film in the final act will bring a smile to your face and maybe even a tear to your eyes.",4,Son of Rambow,1290556800,"11 24, 2010",2010,2822,"['was', 'big', 'fan', 'first-time', 'filmmakers', 'Hammer', 'Tongs', 'Garth', 'Jennings', 'Nick', 'Goldsmith', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'duo', 'had', 'worked', 'music', 'videos', 'other', 'film', 'projects', 'Hitchhiker', 'adaptation', 'iconic', 'sci-fi', 'novel', 'was', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'surprising', 'were', 'given', 'keys', 'big', 'project', 'one', 'had', 'been', 'development', 'decades', 'Hammer', 'Tongs', 'handled', 'material', 'quite', 'admirably', 'order', 'make', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'had', 'put', 'film', 'were', 'developing', 'hold', 'project', 'would', 'eventually', 'become', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'Son', 'Rambow.Son', 'Rambow', 'story', 'Will', 'Bill', 'Milner', 'family', 'part', 'strict', 'religious', 'sect', 'known', 'Plymouth', 'Brethren', 'Will', 'never', 'watched', 'TV', 'even', 'leave', 'classroom', 'when', 'show', 'documentary', 'school', 'how', 'Lee', 'Will', 'Poulter', 'class', 'troublemaker', 'Will', 'Lee', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'Lee', 'Will', 'first', 'taste', 'film', 'form', 'Rambo', 'First', 'Blood', 'Lee', 'recruits', 'Will', 'play', 'stunt', 'man', 'Rambo', 'film', 'creating', 'enter', 'Screen', 'Test', 'Young', 'Filmmaker', 'Competition.Son', 'Rambow', 'most', 'part', 'love', 'song', 'film', 'general', 'way', 'kind', 'reminds', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'very', 'important', 'difference', 'Rambow', 'will', 'take', 'back', 'time', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'not', 'remember', 'time', 'when', 'movies', 'were', 'still', 'magical', 'days', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'commonplace', 'never', 'truly', 'get', 'excited', 'what', 'screen', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'eyes', 'Will', 'get', 'feel', 'what', 'experience', 'like.Rambow', 'also', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'look', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'innocence', 'lost', 'beginning', 'film', 'Will', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'difference', 'world', 'member', 'Plymouth', 'Brethren', 'outside', 'world', 'Lee', ""n't"", 'have', 'connection', 'close', 'friend', 'really', 'anyone', 'matter', 'course', 'film', 'watch', 'connection', 'two', 'boys', 'develops', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'really', 'brilliant', 'look', 'back', 'what', 'be', 'kid', 'allowing', 'feel', 'joys', 'pains', 'early', 'adolescence.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'watch', 'today', 'really', 'amazing', 'how', 'film', 'experience', 'what', 'characters', 'feel', 'see', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'kid', 'again', 'seeing', 'film', 'new', 'eyes', 're-experiencing', 'childhood', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'not-so-jaded', 'look', 'love', 'cinema', 'be', 'sure', 'give', 'try', 'anything', 'screening', 'actual', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'will', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'maybe', 'even', 'tear', 'eyes']",Son of Rambow anglais

And, I love all things British.This is a story of a young boy finding his way in a world that has not been allowed into his fundamentalist home and of his budding friendship with another boy from a more permissive home. Having gotten an illicit look at the movieRamboat his friend's house, the boy decides to film his own action movie. The children's imaginative play when they're filming their movie is fun to watch.It's a fine movie for the most part, but I found a few things hindered my enjoyment. First, if you have a child, especially a boy, it can be hard to watch the escapades of the children. One in particular almost results in the death of a child, and I couldn't watch that.Also, the Plymouth Brethren household the boy grows up in is ridiculously repressive. I've been in strict PB households and they're nothing like that. Maybe it's different in the British Isles. I've been to Brethren church services there, though, and haven't found that to be so. If the church had been portrayed more realistically, the story would have drawn me in more. As it is, the unbending adults just came across as pawns in the director's plot.I would also suggest you don't let young children watch the movie, both for the scenes of chaos (they don't need any more ideas!) and for some overly realistic scenes with older teenagers. The pace would be too slow for my child, anyway.For a more engaging portrayal of a fundamentalist family, drawn with its warmth as well as its faults, you might readPortofino: A Novel (Calvin Becker Trilogy)by Frank Schaeffer.

1163436,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0019GJ42Y,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","SON OF RAMBOW is a surprisingly sweet and uplifting movie, and I highly recommend it for audiences about age 12 and above. While many will have some trouble with the accents, I also find that my ears ""tune"" to the accents after awhile...hopefully it works the same with others. The film is rated PG-13, primarily for ""Reckless Behavior""...so perhaps you'd want to remind your kids NOT to do the things the kids in THIS movie do!And what do these kids do? Well, essentially, a couple of British parochial schoolboys try to make a sequel to RAMBO II. That is the basic premise that lured me to this movie...I was looking for some good laughs. What I got was a film with a lot of heart, and a decent amount of laughs too.It's sometime in the early `80s...a time when very few people owned camcorders. Carter is a troubled boy (age around 12, I'd guess). He's constantly being kicked out of class and just has a generally disagreeable attitude. He also lives in a rather unusual looking apartment that is attached to a nursing home out in the country. The home is owned by his parents, but they are almost NEVER around, because they are traveling Europe all the time...leaving Carter to spend his days with his cocky, obnoxious older brother. One thing Carter DOES enjoy is playing around with his brother's precious camcorder. He dreams of making a film that will one day win a prize on national television contest. But he lacks a story to tell.Will, who appears smaller and younger than Carter (but might be the same age), is being raised in an almost Amish kind of household with a widowed mother, a younger sister and a senile grandmother. He's not allowed to see TV or movies, regularly attends bible study and is in general not a part of society. He also has a very vivid imagination, and has covered every page of his Bible with doodles and cartoons, most of them violent in nature. One day, he and Carter encounter each other, and Carter manipulates Will into being his ""friend,"" which really means his fall-guy and servant. Shortly thereafter, Will accidentally views his first movie, a bootleg video of RAMBO II. Finally, he sees come to life some of the violent images he's been drawing his whole life, and he is transformed. Rambo is now his hero, and he fancies himself to be the ""Son of Rambow"" (yes the misspelling is deliberate). He dresses like Stallone and begins to draw a story of how Rambow's son saves him from imprisonment. Carter gets a glimpse of this new work, and he sees it as a storyboard for the film he's been yearning to make.How these two mis-matched kids work on their film serves as the engine for the movie...but behind that is not only the story of their emerging friendship (you know that's coming)...but also an exploration of the power of film to help these two boys come to grips with their less than fortunate circumstances. Both are outcasts from society (for different reasons) and both have serious absent-parent issues. The themes are fairly easy to follow, but they aren't particularly heavy-handed. In fact, the whole movie is told in a style I would call ""Realistic Whimsy."" The events that occur are not thoroughly believable or even credible...yet it all feels very possible and tangible. Writer/Director Garth Jennings has my highest praise...he's made a movie with a particular tone and manages to stay faithful to that tone from beginning to end. By the conclusion of the film, we are rooting so strongly for these two boys...and we are richly rewarded for letting them capture our hearts for 90 minutes.But as I said at the top, I was looking for some laughs, and they are abundant. There is a significant sub-plot involving a group of French exchange students who come to the school, particularly Didier...a young man who makes the most of his outrageous ""Frenchness"" and soon has a rather unusual entourage of his own. This is very funny stuff indeed, and should have young audiences quite amused. There are, naturally, many funny bits around the actual filming of this ""epic"", including some great moments with a ""flying dog."" (I'll say no more...just enjoy it when you see it.) These are the ""reckless behavior"" moments the rating warns us of...again, just make sure your kids don't get the idea of replicating these stunts!While everyone in the film is quite fine, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Bill Milner (as Will) and Will Poulter (as Carter) pull off their performances darn near perfectly. Milner reminds me a little bit of young Lucas Haas in WITNESS (could it be the Amish connection?).Frankly, there are few significant flaws with the film. It is a bit predictable and a bit sentimental...but as I said, the entire tone of the film sets you up for this right from the get go.

1163438,A2QR035HCPBSLC,B0019GJ42Y,"The B ""ahnonamis""","[2, 3]","When I saw the first trailers for Son of Rambow, I couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately Portland never gets these limited releases, so I was forced to await the eventual DVD release. Now that the DVD is out and I've digested the movie, I've come away with some more mixed feelings than I anticipated.Don't get me wrong: Son of Rambow is a fantastic movie. For the right crowd. Centering around two young lads with a desire to remake the Stallone classic themselves, the movie has an unquestionable charm and presence which will make any audience go ""Awwww!"" in appreciation. Unfortunately, outside of the charm a good majority of the humor and connectedness with the characters is achieved only by two audiences: men old enough to remember when Rambo came out, and children young enough to relate to the two protagonists, Will and Lee.For the rest of us, the movie is an entertaining ride with a fresh outlook on friendship and a nice heartwarming attitude, but not quite the comedy juggernaut one might suppose from the pre-release trailers.Even for the 15-25 crowd, however, Son of Rambow is still a good, solid film if you're willing to see it for what it is. Like Bridge to Terabithia, Son of Rambow mixes several genres and morality lessons together throughout the entertainment. (Although there's nothing quite as sad as the twist in Bridge...) It has surprisingly deep messages for a movie about two younger boys, which completely go against the shallow appearance on the surface.While it's obviously a tale of friendship, the lessons under the skin of the movie are relevant for all ages and people, regardless of time, locale, or culture. And while those in the 15-25 crowd may not have as many laughs as the younger or older audiences, there's still no denying the fact that Son of Rambow offers an invigorating reminder of the power of imagination, and the challenges of growing up.Content - 3.5/5What you get out of Son of Rambow depends entirely on who you are, and how close you are to the culture/age of the two protagonists. The 15-25 crowd may see a heartwarming tale of friendship with some underlying lessons, while an older and younger crowd will f ind much more laughs. No matter which grouping you belong to, expect a unique movie with a refreshing take on friendship, and two very promising young actors.Video - 3/5I can't tell if I'm spoiled by Blu-Ray or not, but the colors seem to reflect more of the amateur nature of the kids' film and less of a real modern movie. While it certainly adds to the effect, it takes away slightly more than it gives, drawing you out of the moment from time to time.Audio - 4/5While there's 5.1 audio and some nice post production present, many of the sound effects rely too heavily on the front speakers, creating an overbalanced feel. The dialogue and other audio factors are all spot-on, but the front-heavy sfx can also draw you out of the moment if you're utilizing 5.1 speakers (or a 5.1 headset) while watching.Replay - 4.5/5It's one of those movies you could watch time and time again with new people. The humor may get old and lose ""the funny"" after a few watchings, but the core tale is more than enough to ensure that this will be a cult classic for many years, and a favorite of many young boys and teens to come.Overall - 4/5Watching Son of Rambow is like playing darts on a jumbo sized target. No matter where you throw the dart you're going to hit the board, but some people are going to be much closer to the bullseye than others. The humor and amount of funny moments in the movie directly relates to your age and gender, but no matter which gender you are and when you were born, the tale of friendship, growing up, and the overpowering effect of a youth's imagination offers something anyone can relate to.",4,"Quaint, and perfect for those who grew up in the 80s",1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,3785,"['When', 'saw', 'first', 'trailers', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Unfortunately', 'Portland', 'never', 'limited', 'releases', 'was', 'forced', 'await', 'eventual', 'DVD', 'release', 'Now', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'digested', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'come', 'away', 'more', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'anticipated.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'right', 'crowd', 'Centering', 'around', 'two', 'young', 'lads', 'desire', 'remake', 'Stallone', 'classic', 'movie', 'unquestionable', 'charm', 'presence', 'will', 'make', 'audience', 'go', 'Awwww', 'appreciation', 'Unfortunately', 'charm', 'good', 'majority', 'humor', 'connectedness', 'characters', 'achieved', 'only', 'two', 'audiences', 'men', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'when', 'Rambo', 'came', 'out', 'children', 'young', 'enough', 'relate', 'two', 'protagonists', 'Will', 'Lee.For', 'rest', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'fresh', 'outlook', 'friendship', 'nice', 'heartwarming', 'attitude', 'not', 'quite', 'comedy', 'juggernaut', 'one', 'might', 'suppose', 'pre-release', 'trailers.Even', '15-25', 'crowd', 'however', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'still', 'good', 'solid', 'film', ""'re"", 'willing', 'see', 'what', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'mixes', 'several', 'genres', 'morality', 'lessons', 'together', 'entertainment', 'nothing', 'quite', 'as', 'sad', 'twist', 'Bridge', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'messages', 'movie', 'two', 'younger', 'boys', 'completely', 'go', 'shallow', 'appearance', 'surface.While', 'obviously', 'tale', 'friendship', 'lessons', 'skin', 'movie', 'are', 'relevant', 'ages', 'people', 'regardless', 'time', 'locale', 'culture', '15-25', 'crowd', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'many', 'laughs', 'younger', 'older', 'audiences', 'still', 'denying', 'fact', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'invigorating', 'reminder', 'power', 'imagination', 'challenges', 'growing', 'up.Content', '3.5/5What', 'get', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'entirely', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'close', 'are', 'culture/age', 'two', 'protagonists', '15-25', 'crowd', 'may', 'see', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'friendship', 'underlying', 'lessons', 'older', 'younger', 'crowd', 'will', 'f', 'ind', 'much', 'more', 'laughs', 'matter', 'grouping', 'belong', 'expect', 'unique', 'movie', 'refreshing', 'take', 'friendship', 'two', 'very', 'promising', 'young', 'actors.Video', '3/5I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'m"", 'spoiled', 'Blu-Ray', 'not', 'colors', 'seem', 'reflect', 'more', 'amateur', 'nature', 'kids', 'film', 'less', 'real', 'modern', 'movie', 'certainly', 'effect', 'away', 'slightly', 'more', 'drawing', 'moment', 'time', 'time.Audio', '4/5While', '5.1', 'audio', 'nice', 'post', 'production', 'present', 'many', 'sound', 'effects', 'rely', 'too', 'heavily', 'front', 'speakers', 'creating', 'overbalanced', 'feel', 'dialogue', 'other', 'audio', 'factors', 'are', 'spot-on', 'front-heavy', 'sfx', 'can', 'also', 'draw', 'moment', ""'re"", 'utilizing', '5.1', 'speakers', '5.1', 'headset', 'watching.Replay', '4.5/5It', 'one', 'movies', 'could', 'watch', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'new', 'people', 'humor', 'may', 'get', 'old', 'lose', 'funny', 'few', 'watchings', 'core', 'tale', 'more', 'enough', 'ensure', 'will', 'be', 'cult', 'classic', 'many', 'years', 'favorite', 'many', 'young', 'boys', 'teens', 'come.Overall', '4/5Watching', 'Son', 'Rambow', 'playing', 'darts', 'jumbo', 'sized', 'target', 'matter', 'where', 'throw', 'dart', ""'re"", 'going', 'hit', 'board', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'much', 'closer', 'bullseye', 'others', 'humor', 'amount', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'directly', 'age', 'gender', 'matter', 'gender', 'are', 'when', 'were', 'born', 'tale', 'friendship', 'growing', 'up', 'overpowering', 'effect', 'youth', 'imagination', 'something', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate']",Son of Rambow anglais

1163441,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0019GJ42Y,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Set in the early 80s Britain, ""Son of Rambow"" follows the budding friendship between two boys, a local ""bad boy"" Lee Carter (Will Poulter, to be seen in ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"") and Will Proudfoot (Bill Milner, ""Is Anybody There?""), a shy 10-year-old boy with wild imagination. Will, a member of the Plymouth Brethren, is not allowed to see TV shows or movies, but when he sees ""First Blood"" in Lee's house (actually, it was a bootleg copy), the mismatched pair embarks on making a movie of their own.You may find it difficult to sit through the film's introductory part. Frankly, some of schoolboys and other characters are not very likable at first sight. Lee first appears as a boy who steals and exploits the good will of his new friend. Lee's selfish brother Lawrence (Ed Westwick) treats Lee bad. Will's mother Mary (Jessica Hynes) loves his son, but she also looks too strict. The two boys break things (more than once) and their filmmaking involves some dangerous stunts (shown in a very exaggerated fashion). They are not exactly kind of people you want to meet in real life, until you come to know more about these characters.Nostalgia plays a significant role in ""Son of Rambow,"" written and directed by Garth Jennings (the 2005 feature film ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""). What is more remarkable is almost all characters are given eccentric traits, an incredibly ""popular"" French exchange student Didier (Jules Sitruk), for instance.This is a coming-of-age tale like ""Stand by Me,"" but told in an offbeat and quirky fashion.
