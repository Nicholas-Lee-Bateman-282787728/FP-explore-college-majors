Griffin ""aegriffin""","[6, 8]","I have seen the better adaptations of this story (i.e., Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke, Welles/Fontaine), but this Cusack/Jayston version is the best because of the superb casting, acting, and faithfulness to the novel.  I concur absolutely with another reader who says Cusack is a better Jane Eyre than the excellent Zelah Clarke; both Clarke and Timothy Dalton are too stiff; they give stage, rather than screen, performances.  Also, Timothy Dalton (as one of the world's best looking men) cannot be credited as Bronte's Vulcan-like Edward Rochester.  (As a bit of trivia, the actress who plays the cruel Mrs. Reed in the Cusack/Jayston version later plays Mrs. Fairfax in the Clarke/Dalton version.)Highly recommended.",5,Excellent Adaptation,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,718,"['have', 'seen', 'better', 'adaptations', 'story', 'i.e.', 'Timothy', 'Dalton/Zelah', 'Clarke', 'Welles/Fontaine', 'Cusack/Jayston', 'version', 'best', 'superb', 'casting', 'acting', 'faithfulness', 'novel', 'concur', 'absolutely', 'reader', 'who', 'Cusack', 'better', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'excellent', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'Clarke', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'are', 'too', 'stiff', 'give', 'stage', 'rather', 'screen', 'performances', 'Also', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'one', 'world', 'best', 'looking', 'men', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'credited', 'Bronte', 'Vulcan-like', 'Edward', 'Rochester', 'bit', 'trivia', 'actress', 'who', 'cruel', 'Mrs.', 'Reed', 'Cusack/Jayston', 'version', 'later', 'Mrs.', 'Fairfax', 'Clarke/Dalton', 'version', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

This version has Jane voicing her thoughts as they were in the correct scenes.  Not typical for a movie, but it works.  And you know what Jane is thinking, which can be difficult from only the dialogue.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I was not expecting to be this impressed with a movie that is older than my 35 years.  Best if you want a movie that follows the book, and the acting is great to boot.I am totally in love with the 2007 masterpiece theater version of this movie, which is my favorite hands down. ( I have only one small criticism of it.)  Again, fabulous acting.  The 2007 version is best if you want an enjoyable movie true to the spirit of the book and true to most dialogue, and it is visually very nice!The most recent (2011) was very beautiful with a very good Jane, but just too much was left out.  The story is just too complicated to be a comprehensive enough movie in two hours, though the makers of this movie did a great job with their version of Pride and Prejudice.

After the exquisitely masterful acting of Cusack in this role, it will take some adjustment on my part to see her in other roles.  To put it as plainly as I can, Sorcha was Jane Eyre.  The overall casting was very good; Michael Jayston's Rochester was very true to Charlotte's Bronte's vision of a deeply wounded misguided man searching for true meaning and fulfillment in a very Class conscious, frivolous society.  It was refreshing to see Stephanie Beacham as a young woman who was the very female prototype of that priviledged, claustrophobic, and very clueless world that shunned people such as Jane.

I thought the acting, especially Michael Jayston's, was quite good. (Also, I thought the support roles in this film were better played than in the 1983 adaptation.)The picture quality in this 1973 adaptation is slightly worse than in the 1983 adaptation. Yet, the picture quality is not poor. (The picture quality reminded me of BBC's ""Emma"" from 1972 or BBC's ""David Copperfield"" from 1974.That said:1.I think this adaptation is excellent. It is different than the 1983 (and slightly shorter). However, it covers most of the same scenes, keeps the original dialogue from the novel, contains excellent acting, and is worth owning if you can purchase it for a reasonable cost. (Otherwise, you know where you can watch it online.)2.If you haven't watched the 1981, 1983, 1996, 1997, and 2006 adaptations (all in color), I would advise starting with the 1983 (just because of the low cost). The 1983 is still loyal to the novel in its script, even if some of the acting is less perfected than the 1973. After watching the 1983, I would consider watching the 1973, especially if you thought the 1983 was not loyal enough to Charlotte Bronte's novel.Note:Personally, I think the 1996 and 2006 are the worst adaptations. The 1996 condenses too much; the 2006 modernizes the English language and the story-line.

I found it very enjoyable in nearly all respects. This version most resembles the Timothy Dalton film, in many cases word for word as they both stick closely to the dialogue in the novel. This version has a little more of the dialogue, however. It sticks very closely to the book, though there are a few variations. For example in this movie Jane guesses immediately who the ""gypsy"" really is, and therefore Rochester doesn't have a chance to use the ruse to try to get Jane to make a confession.As for some of the criticisms, I didn't find the voice over narration to be intrusive but rather illustrated Jane's interior monologue. I also didn't find the characters to be cold to each other.

994756,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000FS9FG2,Byron Kolln,"[5, 6]","Admirers of Charlotte Bronte's gothic romance JANE EYRE have always been spoiled with numerous outstanding film and TV versions, but this 1973 BBC miniseries may well be the best screen adaptation of them all - probably only rivalled by the 1980's BBC miniseries with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton.  Starring the lovely Sorcha Cusack (in her television debut) as Jane, and Michael Jayston as Rochester, this five-part miniseries tells the story with great flair and simplicity with lots of reverence to the source novel.Orphan Jane Eyre (played as a child by Juliet Waley and for the rest of the series by Cusack) is an unwanted ward at Gateshead, the estate owned by her ""pious, Christian guardian"" Mrs Reed (Jean Harvey - who'd go on to play Mrs Fairfax in the 1980's miniseries).  Mentally and physically assaulted at every possible turn by Mrs Reed, her children and even the servants; Jane happily swaps her miserable life at Gateshead for the relative normality promised at the Lowood Institute, a girl's school run by another monster, Mr Brocklehurst (John Philips).  The school is kept in bad order, and Brocklehurst is later packed off and replaced with an independent committee when a typhus outbreak sweeps through the school and kills several of the pupils.Jane graduates as a pupil and remains for another few years at Lowood as a teacher, but her adventurous spirit soon carries her to a far-away posting at Thornfield Hall.  There she becomes governess to a charming young French waif, Adele (Isabelle Rosin), but finds her master, a Mr Edward Rochester (Jayston), to be a man swathed in much mystery and melancholy.  Late at night, screams and eerie laughter can be heard echoing through the hallways of Thornfield, and on one occasion, Jane rescues Rochester when his bed is set alight.  As romance inevitably blooms between Jane and her master, what evil forces could be at work to split them apart?Very rarely has JANE EYRE been told with such spellbinding simplicity and with such fidelity to the original novel (sometimes right down to the colours of the character's clothes).  The BBC literary miniseries of the 1970's are still quite often amongst the best of the best, and this ""Jane Eyre"" is no exception.  With a cracking script by Robin Chapman and winning performances all-round (including Megs Jenkins and Stephanie Beacham in great supporting roles), this is a must-see for all ""Jane Eyre"" admirers.

994757,A23UB49EG29MVT,B000FS9FG2,Commenter77,"[2, 2]","I liked this Rochester so much I looked around for other works of this actor who did him so well.  I loved his voice and carriage.  To me, he characterized how a not-so-handsome man can be attractive. While he revealed cantankerousness and his jaded view of life, there was sensitivity in his face and manner around Jane.  He appeared to be actually listening attentively to her responses to his early brusque interrogations of her instead of just saying lines.  He was after all a man in search of a worthier life's companion.  I have always been vexed (including in the book) by the way he toyed with her and circumstances to provoke attraction to him. It was easier to see in this version that it revealed an insecurity in him that she could care for him given his inner sense of unworthiness of a decent and atypically true woman. That he played games with it was in keeping with his habitual environment, goaded by what seemed her reluctance toward him. Yet there lay within him a latent higher nature, drawn out by the simple worth of Jane's more careful and considering nature.Jane is a very unsophisticated girl, yet her disciplines in her school life in order to survive it served her well, along with the strong influences of Helen Burns and Ms. Temple.  She could have been that perky because she was so free of compromise and societal insincerities.  It reminded me that Jane was actually never a difficult child, and that the injustices rendered her in the Reed household were entirely that.  She was a worthy enough child and retained her inherent goodness throughout the period of further injustices at the odious school.  She stayed the course and emerged a respected member of the teaching staff, earning even the grudged commendation of the odious Mr. Brocklehurst.This girl-woman had the practiced fortitude to withstand a Rochester and retain her self-forged heart convictions and yet show her honest feelings even under pressure.  She had little to compare with, but she liked what she saw in Rochester and paid the price of retaining him in her heart.  Thus, she realized her dream beyond the point of what most would consider its worth.  Side note:  I enjoyed the little license taken when Rochester summarily dismissed the haughty Blanche (the most beautiful one of all the versions), who came to the library to draw him into her current pursuit and away from ""that person"" with whom he was conversing.  His self-pleased reaction to her reaction was gratifying and could have spoken volumes to the distracted Jane had she care to attend - though it was indeed a license taken with the book.  Gratifying of this Rochester nonetheless.It does take an extended version, a series, to do this layered story justice and I thought it was successful here.  While the 1983 Timothy Dalton version is good in similar respects, his Rochester never rang as true to me, and not just because of his good looks. I don't think he demonstrated near the skill for nuanced portrayal as Jayston does here.  I've never been satisfied with a Jane actress, but would prefer Cusak in this 1973 version to the Clarke representation.  I think it was appropriate that Jane had strength. That is one of her distinctions as a simple heroine.  Ms. Clarke seemed to go from scared mouse to playful kitten without showing forth the spunk of that young Jane in the Reed home, who though outnumbered and outgunned did not allow herself to be crushed under the weight of the opposition.Though lacking in later production qualities, this to me is the heart story and well done for foundational values such as skillful casting, acting and trueness to the spirit as well as the letter of the source material.",5,Overall Favorite,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,3693,"['liked', 'Rochester', 'so', 'much', 'looked', 'other', 'works', 'actor', 'who', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'loved', 'voice', 'carriage', 'characterized', 'how', 'not-so-handsome', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'attractive', 'revealed', 'cantankerousness', 'jaded', 'view', 'life', 'was', 'sensitivity', 'face', 'manner', 'around', 'Jane', 'appeared', 'be', 'actually', 'listening', 'attentively', 'responses', 'early', 'brusque', 'interrogations', 'instead', 'just', 'saying', 'lines', 'was', 'man', 'search', 'worthier', 'life', 'companion', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'vexed', 'including', 'book', 'way', 'toyed', 'circumstances', 'provoke', 'attraction', 'was', 'easier', 'see', 'version', 'revealed', 'insecurity', 'could', 'care', 'given', 'inner', 'sense', 'unworthiness', 'decent', 'atypically', 'true', 'woman', 'played', 'games', 'was', 'keeping', 'habitual', 'environment', 'goaded', 'what', 'seemed', 'reluctance', 'lay', 'latent', 'higher', 'nature', 'drawn', 'out', 'simple', 'worth', 'Jane', 'more', 'careful', 'considering', 'nature.Jane', 'very', 'unsophisticated', 'girl', 'yet', 'disciplines', 'school', 'life', 'order', 'survive', 'served', 'well', 'strong', 'influences', 'Helen', 'Burns', 'Ms.', 'Temple', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'perky', 'was', 'so', 'free', 'compromise', 'societal', 'insincerities', 'reminded', 'Jane', 'was', 'actually', 'never', 'difficult', 'child', 'injustices', 'rendered', 'Reed', 'household', 'were', 'entirely', 'was', 'worthy', 'enough', 'child', 'retained', 'inherent', 'goodness', 'period', 'further', 'injustices', 'odious', 'school', 'stayed', 'course', 'emerged', 'respected', 'member', 'teaching', 'staff', 'earning', 'even', 'grudged', 'commendation', 'odious', 'Mr.', 'Brocklehurst.This', 'girl-woman', 'had', 'practiced', 'fortitude', 'withstand', 'Rochester', 'retain', 'self-forged', 'heart', 'convictions', 'yet', 'show', 'honest', 'feelings', 'even', 'pressure', 'had', 'little', 'compare', 'liked', 'what', 'saw', 'Rochester', 'paid', 'price', 'retaining', 'heart', 'Thus', 'realized', 'dream', 'point', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'consider', 'worth', 'Side', 'note', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'license', 'taken', 'when', 'Rochester', 'summarily', 'dismissed', 'haughty', 'Blanche', 'most', 'beautiful', 'one', 'versions', 'who', 'came', 'library', 'draw', 'current', 'pursuit', 'away', 'person', 'whom', 'was', 'conversing', 'self-pleased', 'reaction', 'reaction', 'was', 'gratifying', 'could', 'have', 'spoken', 'volumes', 'distracted', 'Jane', 'had', 'care', 'attend', 'was', 'indeed', 'license', 'taken', 'book', 'Gratifying', 'Rochester', 'nonetheless.It', 'take', 'extended', 'version', 'series', 'do', 'layered', 'story', 'justice', 'thought', 'was', 'successful', 'here', '1983', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'version', 'good', 'similar', 'respects', 'Rochester', 'never', 'rang', 'true', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'looks', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'demonstrated', 'skill', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'Jayston', 'here', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'satisfied', 'Jane', 'actress', 'would', 'prefer', 'Cusak', '1973', 'version', 'Clarke', 'representation', 'think', 'was', 'appropriate', 'Jane', 'had', 'strength', 'one', 'distinctions', 'simple', 'heroine', 'Ms.', 'Clarke', 'seemed', 'go', 'scared', 'mouse', 'playful', 'kitten', 'showing', 'forth', 'spunk', 'young', 'Jane', 'Reed', 'home', 'who', 'outnumbered', 'outgunned', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'be', 'crushed', 'weight', 'opposition.Though', 'lacking', 'later', 'production', 'qualities', 'heart', 'story', 'well', 'done', 'foundational', 'values', 'such', 'skillful', 'casting', 'acting', 'trueness', 'spirit', 'as', 'well', 'letter', 'source', 'material']",N/A

994759,AQ5NFBZYOHNQ6,B000FS9FG2,"JB ""bookworm""","[32, 37]","The '73 BBC production of ""Jane Eyre"" with Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayston is a decent adaptation of Charlotte Bront's classic novel - and heaven knows there are few enough decent versions around - but it pales in comparison to the outstanding BBC production of '83 in several respects. Firstly, the '73 version has the weaker script, which very often stays too close to the novel for is own good, yet at times diverts unnecessarily from the literary model. It may sound paradoxical that a production of Jane Eyre can stay too close to the novel, but so it is. The long dialogues between Rochester and Jane are a joy to read, but when they are transferred to the screen in nearly their full length as in this production, their complexity and very unusualness create an impression of artificiality and staginess. The '83 version, on the contrary, shows how superbly these dialogues can be adapted to the screen. There, scriptwriter Alexander Baron did not keep all the lines, but infallibly picked the core lines which are essential to characterize the protagonists and convey the essence of the scenes. Faithful as the long conversation are rendered in the '73 version, they appeal to the intellect rather than the heart, they are interesting, but not captivating, and they lack the focus and also the intensity of the scenes between Rochester and Jane in the '83 version.Another negative point is the more than frequent use of Jane's voice-overs. Nearly all versions make use of that technique and with just reason, but in this adaptation it is driven to absurd extremes. Jane's inner voice constantly interrupts even the dialogues between her and Rochester, only to inform the audience about what is already blatantly obvious and what could have been shown as effectively by plain good acting. Alas, Sorcha Cusack's acting abilities are limited - at least in this role. She either raises her eyebrows or wears an amused, know-all smile, which is simply not enough to render the character of the novel's heroine. But then her whole concept of Jane is wrong. She plays Jane as a self-confident, sophisticated and worldly-wise young woman, who is right from the beginning on terms of equality with Mr Rochester. She completely misses Jane's guardedness, her shyness, modesty and inexperience. Her Jane is even snappish and pert at times. But the misrepresentation of Jane's character is not Cusack's fault alone but partly also due to the script, which brings me back to my first point of criticism: Since the script is overall so faithful to the novel, the viewer naturally concludes that each word uttered in this version must come straight from the novel - but such is not the case. A very attentive reader of the novel will have noticed that they frequently put repartees and remarks in Jane's mouth which she does not utter in the novel and which give her a sophistication, shrewdness and boldness the young and inexperienced Jane of the novel does not possess. And getting Jane wrong they also got the relationship between her and Rochester wrong. She constantly has the final say during their conversations, she dominates and lectures Rochester instead of being lectured by him.With such a Jane there is little Michael Jayston as Rochester can do. Jayston is an admirable, subtle actor, who speaks his many lines well and who is really the highlight of this version, but unfortunately he lacks that charisma, that great overpowering presence and natural authority which are necessary to play Rochester and which for example make Orson Welles a more convincing Rochester in the '44 movie, although he has much less screen time than Jayston and does not possess the latter's subtlety. Jayston is superb at playing the eloquent and refined gentleman, but simply cannot portray Rochester' imperious and dark side, and his outbursts of anger and temperament seem unnatural and forced. In the '83 version all sides of Rochester's character are rendered in equal perfection by Timothy Dalton, who combines magnetism and a great acting range and who is furthermore unrivalled in his incredible delivery of Charlotte Bront' unusual language. Unfortunately there is also little chemistry between Jayston and Cusack: their interplay is amusing but it lacks feeling and their love scenes are passionless and dry.As regards the plot most of the novel's important scenes are faithfully shown in this version - although the part between Jane's flight from Thornfield and her arrival at Moor House is cut out - but two scenes are altered and to their disadvantage. The first is the gipsy scene. In this version Jane guesses who the gypsy woman really is even before she sees her. Rochester can only say a few sentences before Jane makes him stop the masquerade. In the novel this scene is an admirable means of characterizing both Rochester and Jane - here it only serves to make Jane look very smart and Rochester like a fool. Better to leave out that scene than to mutilate it in that fashion. The second is the parting scene after the aborted wedding. This scene would have benefited if they had stayed closer to the novel, but for some reason they considerably shortened it and consequently that scene conveys next to none of the heartbreak and despair of the scene of the novel. Again, both these scenes are done to perfection in the '83 version.Let me conclude by saying that despite all my points of criticism I still think that this version in its overall great faithfulness to the novel is miles above nearly all other Jane Eyre adaptation, and I would invite all true lovers of the novels - and using that term I exclude all those who earnestly affirm that the silly 2006 perversion of Jane Eyre is true to the novel or to the spirit of the novel - to watch both the productions of '73 and '83 and to form their own opinion. For my part I have found the definitive Jane Eyre in the '83 adaptation.",3,Dominant Jane and Gentleman Rochester,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,5899,"[""'73"", 'BBC', 'production', 'Jane', 'Eyre',

994760,A2D9TA1EYXA9KR,B000FS9FG2,"J. Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[10, 13]","Some Eyre enthusiasts say that this is their favorite version.  Sorcha Cusak plays a Jane heavy on the ""elfin"" aspects of the character, and Michael Jayston gives a really strong portrayal of Rochester.  Sorcha Cusak is a fine actress, but is not at all plain, she has an unusual striking beauty, and is nearly as tall as Rochester, which makes her a bad fit for Eyre purists.I suspect it is her personal lightness and charm which make people like this version, but this is precisely what makes her an incorrect Jane. We find that she looks very much like a blonde version of the dark haired beauty Blanche, so much so that they could be sisters, which is, of course, a miscast Jane.This TV miniseries version looks much more like film than the 1983 version (which has the best Jane ever, Zelah Clarke), which makes for pretty viewing.  Here, Michael Jayston is a much more believable Rochester than the gorgeous James Bond Rochester, Timothy Dalton.  This version was very true to the dialogue of the book, but the endless over-narrations by Jane (telling us her motives and thoughts) are extremely unfaithful to the book, and are another thing that make this version very dissonant.These 70s miniseries are very slow, but this one is exceptionally well done, and stands up much better over time than others of the same period.  Conversely, we have the awful 70s hair, very fluffy and with the big bump in the back that was so much in Vogue, and even the mysterious woman in the attic has on heavy eye makeup when we see her.  So many little things are so right (the best Grace Poole is in this version) , but then disappointing in so many little ways.  This version is several parts shorter than the 80s version, and it suffers from it.Overall, this is a very well done version, but if you have the patience for older TV miniseries, treat yourself to the 80s version, which is the most faithful to the book, especially by giving proper weight to the second half, which is where Bronte gets to sink her teeth into ethical and spiritual issues.",4,A spiritually dissonant adaptation with fine acting.,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,2044,"['Eyre', 'enthusiasts', 'say', 'favorite', 'version', 'Sorcha', 'Cusak', 'Jane', 'heavy', 'elfin', 'aspects', 'character', 'Michael', 'Jayston', 'really', 'strong', 'portrayal', 'Rochester', 'Sorcha', 'Cusak', 'fine', 'actress', 'not', 'plain', 'unusual', 'striking', 'beauty', 'nearly', 'as', 'tall', 'Rochester', 'bad', 'fit', 'Eyre', 'purists.I', 'suspect', 'personal', 'lightness', 'charm', 'make', 'people', 'version', 'precisely', 'what', 'incorrect', 'Jane', 'find', 'very', 'much', 'blonde', 'version', 'dark', 'haired', 'beauty', 'Blanche', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'sisters', 'course', 'miscast', 'Jane.This', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'film', '1983', 'version', 'best', 'Jane', 'ever', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'pretty', 'viewing', 'Here', 'Michael', 'Jayston', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'Rochester', 'gorgeous', 'James', 'Bond', 'Rochester', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'version', 'was', 'very', 'true', 'dialogue', 'book', 'endless', 'over-narrations', 'Jane', 'telling', 'motives', 'thoughts', 'are', 'extremely', 'unfaithful', 'book', 'are', 'thing', 'make', 'version', 'very', 'dissonant.These', '70s', 'miniseries', 'are', 'very', 'slow', 'one', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'up', 'much', 'better', 'time', 'others', 'same', 'period', 'Conversely', 'have', 'awful', '70s', 'hair', 'very', 'fluffy', 'big', 'bump', 'back', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'Vogue', 'even', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'attic', 'heavy', 'eye', 'makeup', 'when', 'see', 'So', 'many', 'little', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'right', 'best', 'Grace', 'Poole', 'version', 'then', 'disappointing', 'so', 'many', 'little', 'ways', 'version', 'several', 'parts', 'shorter', '80s', 'version', 'it.Overall', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'version', 'have', 'patience', 'older', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'treat', '80s', 'version', 'most', 'faithful', 'book', 'especially', 'giving', 'proper', 'weight', 'second', 'half', 'where', 'Bronte', 'sink', 'teeth', 'ethical', 'spiritual', 'issues']",N/A

It is  faithful to the book. I really really like Michael Jayston. He plays a very wonderful Rochester.Why I didn't give it 5 stars is because of Sorcha Cusack. I did not care for her as Jane. Through most of the movie she has this strange little smile on her face. She came off very frumpy partially from that horrible wig or fall they gave her to wear.The  penciled brows did not help either. They gave her rather an owlish Garrison Keillor type quality. Her acting was insincere and coy rather than the Plain, strong willed yet sincere, kind and ernest fairy, elfin like character so vivdly described in Charlotte Brontes ever classic literature.It is Michael Jayston with his terrific talent that carries this movie through.I will say as one other reviewer stated. this is a very expensive DVD. Rent it first or wait until it comes down in price a littleMay I suggest The Orson Welles or Timothy Dalton version. while Welles version is very condenced, Orson is the most perfect example of mr Rochester I have ever seen. The movie has a gothic moodiness that is perfect. Joan Fontaine while too pretty has an etherial wholsomeness that is very appealing.Plus lovely Elizabeth Taylor as Helen Burns.. I just wish they had put more of the content of the book in that version.Daltons version while he too handsome to be Rochester,overcomes that fact magnificently by his absolutley unpresidented acting. He is  Edward Rochester. He understands the part and the Shakespearian training he had really pays off...  that film adaptation is also most faithful to the book.

994764,A3I41MF1O2FAC,B000FS9FG2,"Laura Merucci ""marspeach""","[4, 7]","Arguably the two most faithful Jane Eyre adaptations are the BBC miniseries from 1973 and 1983, respectively. The fanbase is divided over which is the better one on the whole. While I have previously seen the 1983 version, this was actually my first time watching 1973, for this review. It is comprised of 5 episodes of approximately 50 minutes each, and stars Sorcha Cusack as Jane and Michael Jayston as Mr. Rochester. This is the only production I have seen either one of them in.I do have to say, it is true that this version is very faithful to the novel. This was quite refreshing after seeing all of the older adaptations that changed so much! A lot of the dialogue is lifted right from the book, and most of the characters remain intact and true to their original book selves. The entire series is actually narrated by Jane as well, almost as if she is really reading the book. The result is a faithful adaptation that is sure to please purists, but it didn't exactly come to life for me, either. The production values are not up to par with modern adaptations, as usual. The narration, while true to the book, was often redundant and just plain unnecessary. There was no need for Jane to tell us what was happening on screen when we could see it ourselves! The actors at times seemed to pause their conversation to make room for the narration. It even made me LOL at a couple points.The acting was alright. Sorcha Cusack as Jane seemed to think that raising her eyebrows throughout the whole adaptation equaled acting. It was incredibly distracting. Couldn't the director have pointed this out to her?

This, in my opinion, is the definitive production. Sorcha Cusack is, without question, the actress who has captured the essence of the character of Jane. Spirited, with a touch of pathos and individuality, one is truly warmed to her relationship with the tortured Rochester, played by the marvelous Michael Jayston. The actors never allow the characters to be mere caricatures, with the obvious romance inherent, but invest in true depth and nuance to make the characters real and interesting. I had never thought this would be released and am just overwhelmed! I urge all who are looking for the best interpretation of this classic, to look no further and purchase this extraordinary BBC Acorn classic.

I disagree with those who 'diss' Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack in comparison to Zelah Clarke and Tim Dalton - I think that while the comments by one reviewer that perhaps Cusack is a bit tall for Jane are justified, other than THAT I thought both of their performances, while more 'lighthearted' and more subdued than the Clarke/Dalton one(which, assuredly, went more for the melodramatic and heavier gothic feeling of the novel) were excellent.  Cusack's Jane very much captures Rochester's comments on her piquant and pixie-esque qualities, and I do think they had some real chemistry - in fact comments I found online by Jayston said there was real attraction between the two of them during filming and I think it shows.  I think Jayston's performance is brilliant - he chooses to bring a Beethoven-esque type performance to Rochester which I believe is certainly a valid way to go with his characterization, but shows his great sensitivity and pathos with incredible artistry.  I liked Cusack's portrayal of Jane's quiet humor, and she chose to portray Jane with more serenity in her reserve rather than other actresses who have played her have chosen to interpret that word. The only thing I think that is perhaps lacking is a clearer representation of Jane's hunger for human love, having been so starved of it in her growing up years, which is certainly the main reason why the temptation is so huge for her to overcome and why Helen's words about not putting too much stock in human love come back to her when Rochester proposes to her to be his mistress.  For me the Clarke/Dalton portrayal of that scene, taken almost verbatim out of the novel, remains the most pathetic and heart wrenching of all versions, but still I think Jayston's torment, while less melodramatic than Dalton's, was still very effective and touching.  There is also much less here of Jane's time in deprivation and with her cousins, though what is left out isn't offensively left out, and unlike the recent Wilson/Stephens BBC JE, the dialogue here, while somewhat 'fleshed out' in Jane's private thoughts and at times changed slightly from the novel, still retains the 'flavor' of Bronte's writing, while the recent one to me does not at all.The gypsy scene is here too which pleased me greatly since that is one of my favorite ones, though I still love Dalton's portrayal of that best.  But for now Jayston and Cusack are my second favorite and I will love watching this one in alternation with the other Clarke/Dalton one in the years to come.  It makes me sad to think that they were never paired again in another romantic pairing since I believe they did have real chemistry as a screen pair.",5,my second favorite version of the novel on film,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,2982,"['never', 'thought', 'would', 'enjoy', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'years', 'Timothy', 'Dalton/Zelah', 'Clarke', 'version', 'one', 'most', 'loved', 'have', 'admit', 'buying', 'one', 'whim', 'birthday', 'money', 'recently', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'done', 'disagree', 'who', ""'diss"", 'Michael', 'Jayston', 'Sorcha', 'Cusack', 'comparison', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'Tim', 'Dalton', 'think', 'comments', 'one', 'reviewer', 'perhaps', 'Cusack', 'bit', 'tall', 'Jane', 'are', 'justified', 'other', 'thought', 'performances', 'more', ""'lighthearted"", 'more', 'subdued', 'Clarke/Dalton', 'one', 'assuredly', 'went', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'heavier', 'gothic', 'feeling', 'novel', 'were', 'excellent', 'Cusack', 'Jane', 'very', 'much', 'captures', 'Rochester', 'comments', 'piquant', 'pixie-esque', 'qualities', 'do', 'think', 'had', 'real', 'chemistry', 'fact', 'comments', 'found', 'online', 'Jayston', 'said', 'was', 'real', 'attraction', 'two', 'filming', 'think', 'think', 'Jayston', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'bring', 'Beethoven-esque', 'type', 'performance', 'Rochester', 'believe', 'certainly', 'valid', 'way', 'go', 'characterization', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'pathos', 'incredible', 'artistry', 'liked', 'Cusack', 'portrayal', 'Jane', 'quiet', 'humor', 'chose', 'portray', 'Jane', 'more', 'serenity', 'reserve', 'rather', 'other', 'actresses', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'have', 'chosen', 'interpret', 'word', 'only', 'thing', 'think', 'perhaps', 'lacking', 'clearer', 'representation', 'Jane', 'hunger', 'human', 'love', 'having', 'been', 'so', 'starved', 'growing', 'up', 'years', 'certainly', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'temptation', 'so', 'huge', 'overcome', 'why', 'Helen', 'words', 'not', 'putting', 'too', 'much', 'stock', 'human', 'love', 'come', 'back', 'when', 'Rochester', 'be', 'mistress', 'Clarke/Dalton', 'portrayal', 'scene', 'taken', 'almost', 'verbatim', 'novel', 'most', 'pathetic', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'versions', 'still', 'think', 'Jayston', 'torment', 'less', 'melodramatic', 'Dalton', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'effective', 'touching', 'also', 'much', 'less', 'here', 'Jane', 'time', 'deprivation', 'cousins', 'what', 'left', 'out', ""n't"", 'offensively', 'left', 'out', 'recent', 'Wilson/Stephens', 'BBC', 'JE', 'dialogue', 'here', 'somewhat', ""'fleshed"", 'out', 'Jane', 'private', 'thoughts', 'times', 'changed', 'slightly', 'novel', 'still', ""'flavor"", 'Bronte', 'writing', 'recent', 'one', 'not', 'all.The', 'gypsy', 'scene', 'here', 'too', 'pleased', 'greatly', 'one', 'favorite', 'ones', 'still', 'love', 'Dalton', 'portrayal', 'best', 'now', 'Jayston', 'Cusack', 'are', 'second', 'favorite', 'will', 'love', 'watching', 'one', 'alternation', 'other', 'Clarke/Dalton', 'one', 'years', 'come', 'sad', 'think', 'were', 'never', 'paired', 'again', 'romantic', 'pairing', 'believe', 'did', 'have', 'real', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'pair']",N/A

While I think experiencing this version was a worthwhile exercise in its own right, I don't think this version offers anything that hasn't been done better since. In fact, I would say everything was improved upon only 10 years later, in the 1983 BBC version. For example, this version's faithfulness to the novel was matched, if not superceded, in the equally faithful ( and I think more dynamic) 1983 BBC version. Also, while the best thing about this version for me is Michael Jayston as Mr. Rochester - he's attractive enough to be compelling and gruff enough to be Mr. Rochester - I believe Timothy Dalton is more compelling in the 1983 version. Similarly, Sorcha Cusack, for me, suffered in comparison to Zelah Clarke's understanding and portrayal of Jane's passion.

They did stick close to the novel and the adaptation does have it's charm... but it lacks power, nuance and maybe even emotional truth.Before you buy or even rent, I urge you to view some of the 1973 scenes, currently on youtube.  Everyone has a different idea of what good is and -- poor production values aside -- I fear some will find these performances either off point with the story, or too intellectualized by today's standards.I'm not opposed to narration; Jane has few enough lines and Bront's words are visceral, stunning and intructive about her heroine. But the  voice overs *here,* take place during scenes with a lot of dialog.  I mean what's point of accompanying dialog with a running commentary when actors can as easily fill in subtext?  The only place I've seen the device used effectively is in comedies, like SCRUBS, where the split-hair-timing of the juxtaposed VO and dialog actually helps *create* the humor.  However *here,* it is not used to *any* dramatic effect whatsoever.Jayston is probably the stronger of the two and he IS endearing (especially when singing at the piano), but lacks the edge and imposing presence of the Rochester in the novel. Cusack also has her moments, but she plays nearly every scene with arched eyebrows (for reasons I cannot begin to fathom) which gives her the appearance of wearing a mask. And barely seems able to conceal a condescending smirk. She HAS since acknowledged she didn't really have a handle on the role. Tho I know ardent fans will disagree.Otherwise the writers failed to cut passages in ways that make Bront's dialog playable (and the '83 adaptation demonstrates that *much* of it is *very* playable).  So part of the problem may lie there.  I do think the more dynamic '83, which presumably had the lowest budget per hour, is richer and more realized.  It's equally faithful and a lot less self conscious, at least to this viewer.

994775,A1MUP3BTU5XSAL,B000FS9FG2,Spider Wood,"[8, 11]","I think that others have criticized this series in three broad areas.(1) Sorcha's portrayal of Jane is dislikeable and her monologues are bad... I think she's a fire spirit, full of life.  Looks like hiring an Irish actress was a good move.  Zelah Clarke lacked these characteristics.  Sorcha's coyness is part of the cat-and-mouse with Rochester and is a treat.  Her monologues suggest an introspective soul who strives to understand her own feelings honestly.  There may be some technical errors in getting her face to match the monologue, but I was enjoying the program so much I didn't notice.It's possible that monologues are now dated, they used to be much more common in movies.  For comparison, there were some monologues in the movie LA Story (1991) that enhanced the story.  Or you don't agree?(2) Characters speaking verbatim from the book are unbelievable... As a matter of fact, reading aloud was a popular pastime before television.  For such intimate audiences, I argue that believability is trumped by the pleasure of hearing the language.  I certainly wouldn't want the language of Jane Eyre translated into some ""believable"" contemporary dialect, unless for a damn good joke.  Despite television's emphasis on ""realism"", there are a significant number of people who still memorize poetry and plays because of the beauty of the language.  Because they aren't considered the mainstream, TV producers don't bother to cater to them.  This version of Jane Eyre is a valuable  treasure from the earlier days of American public television and the BBC when such audiences were better catered to.(3) The level of passion doesn't score high enough on the scale... Though most reviews have said the leads do a good job, some people expect something like the excesses of the BBC/A&E; Pride and Prejudice (1995).The kissing evidently doesn't convince some people, but others are convinced, so I don't know where the problem lies. Based on what the two actors have done leading up to the proposal scene, even an awkward-looking kiss has got to have some fire behind it.Maybe it's the economical settings, which were nowhere near as lavish as current TV, but suggest the intimacy of really good theatre.Maybe the music isn't right?  The title music was composed by Edward Elgar.  Elgar used to be considered very passionate.  However, maybe because he was British and composed ""Pomp and Circumstance"" people find him stodgy and unpassionate, and they forget the ""Enigma Variations"" and ""Cello Concerto.""  Or maybe the problem is that there is no background music?  I think it's better to hear the dialog clearly and understand the emotions in the scene through that alone, but maybe I'm just picky about music.  I'm glad they didn't use music to manipulate the audience in every scene.  The performances stand on their own.My opinion: with a few exceptions, I prefer series like this to what's turned out today.",5,Firey Jane,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,2914,"['think', 'others', 'have', 'criticized', 'series', 'three', 'broad', 'areas', '1', 'Sorcha', 'portrayal', 'Jane', 'dislikeable', 'monologues', 'are', 'bad', 'think', 'fire', 'spirit', 'full', 'life', 'hiring', 'Irish', 'actress', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'lacked', 'characteristics', 'Sorcha', 'coyness', 'part', 'cat-and-mouse', 'Rochester', 'treat', 'monologues', 'suggest', 'introspective', 'soul', 'who', 'understand', 'own', 'feelings', 'honestly', 'may', 'be', 'technical', 'errors', 'getting', 'face', 'match', 'monologue', 'was', 'enjoying', 'program', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice.It', 'possible', 'monologues', 'are', 'now', 'dated', 'used', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'movies', 'comparison', 'were', 'monologues', 'movie', 'LA', 'Story', '1991', 'enhanced', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', '2', 'Characters', 'speaking', 'verbatim', 'book', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'matter', 'fact', 'reading', 'aloud', 'was', 'popular', 'pastime', 'television', 'such', 'intimate', 'audiences', 'argue', 'believability', 'trumped', 'pleasure', 'hearing', 'language', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'language', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'translated', 'believable', 'contemporary', 'dialect', 'damn', 'good', 'joke', 'television', 'emphasis', 'realism', 'are', 'significant', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'still', 'memorize', 'poetry', 'plays', 'beauty', 'language', 'are', ""n't"", 'considered', 'mainstream', 'TV', 'producers', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'cater', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'valuable', 'treasure', 'earlier', 'days', 'American', 'public', 'television', 'BBC', 'when', 'such', 'audiences', 'were', 'better', 'catered', '3', 'level', 'passion', ""n't"", 'score', 'high', 'enough', 'scale', 'most', 'reviews', 'have', 'said', 'leads', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'people', 'expect', 'something', 'excesses', 'BBC/A', 'E', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '1995', '.The', 'kissing', 'evidently', ""n't"", 'convince', 'people', 'others', 'are', 'convinced', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'problem', 'Based', 'what', 'two', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'leading', 'up', 'proposal', 'scene', 'even', 'awkward-looking', 'kiss', 'got', 'have', 'fire', 'it.Maybe', 'economical', 'settings', 'were', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'lavish', 'current', 'TV', 'suggest', 'intimacy', 'really', 'good', 'theatre.Maybe', 'music', ""n't"", 'right', 'title', 'music', 'was', 'composed', 'Edward', 'Elgar', 'Elgar', 'used', 'be', 'considered', 'very', 'passionate', 'However', 'maybe', 'was', 'British', 'composed', 'Pomp', 'Circumstance', 'people', 'find', 'stodgy', 'unpassionate', 'forget', 'Enigma', 'Variations', 'Cello', 'Concerto', 'maybe', 'problem', 'background', 'music', 'think', 'better', 'hear', 'dialog', 'clearly', 'understand', 'emotions', 'scene', 'alone', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'picky', 'music', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'music', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'scene', 'performances', 'stand', 'own.My', 'opinion', 'few', 'exceptions', 'prefer', 'series', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'today']",N/A

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[9, 11]","This is a good adaptation of Jane Eyre which uses a lot of Charlotte Bronte's exact words  and keeps the essential storyline intact throughout.  Cusack is a great Jane Eyre though as others have said there is no way anyone would believe she was only 18.  As in the novel she is not conventionally attractive  but radiates intelligence, competence and self confidence.  Michael Jayston does not really look the part of Rochester since he is not large, dark or unattractive - all attributes  Bronte gave Mr. Rochester in the novel.  I felt Jayston played the part as too aloof and not really very passionate.  For some reason he kept reminding me of Christopher Plummer in THE SOUND OF MUSIC.  The supporting players were all fine with an especially good portrayal of Mrs. Fairfax.  Also this version gives enough time to St. John Rivers and his sisters to tell their stories.  The Rivers family's  roles are often  overlooked or totally changed in JANE EYRE adaptations.  One additional note I watched this shortly after viewing via download the new BBC JANE EYRE  adaptation that will be shown in the US on Masterpiece Theatre in early 2007.  That version is beautifully presented and has fine acting but in many ways it struck me as too modern and passionate while this 1973 rendering seems too old fashioned and cool.",4,Quite faithful to the book,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,1319,"['good', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'lot', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'exact', 'words', 'essential', 'storyline', 'intact', 'Cusack', 'great', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'way', 'anyone', 'would', 'believe', 'was', 'only', '18', 'novel', 'not', 'conventionally', 'attractive', 'intelligence', 'competence', 'self', 'confidence', 'Michael', 'Jayston', 'not', 'really', 'look', 'part', 'Rochester', 'not', 'large', 'dark', 'unattractive', 'Bronte', 'gave', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'novel', 'felt', 'Jayston', 'played', 'part', 'too', 'aloof', 'not', 'really', 'very', 'passionate', 'reason', 'kept', 'reminding', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'THE', 'SOUND', 'OF', 'MUSIC', 'supporting', 'players', 'were', 'fine', 'especially', 'good', 'portrayal', 'Mrs.', 'Fairfax', 'Also', 'version', 'enough', 'time', 'St.', 'John', 'Rivers', 'sisters', 'tell', 'stories', 'Rivers', 'family', 'roles', 'are', 'often', 'overlooked', 'totally', 'changed', 'JANE', 'EYRE', 'adaptations', 'One', 'additional', 'note', 'watched', 'shortly', 'viewing', 'download', 'new', 'BBC', 'JANE', 'EYRE', 'adaptation', 'will', 'be', 'shown', 'US', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'early', '2007', 'version', 'beautifully', 'presented', 'fine', 'acting', 'many', 'ways', 'struck', 'too', 'modern', 'passionate', '1973', 'rendering', 'too', 'old', 'fashioned', 'cool']",N/A
