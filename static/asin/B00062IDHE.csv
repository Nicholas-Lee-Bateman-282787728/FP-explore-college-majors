She is right up there with Celine as the top two female vocalists in the world. My wife and I have pretty much all her CD's.Having said that, this DVD is a big disappointment. I suppose this started as a TV special, but that is no excuse for the poor quality of the video. We watched it on a 50"" Pioneer plasma with a progressive feed from a good DVD player and the video quality is far below what a DVD is capable of. It's like watching a poor quality analog TV signal over rabbit ears. Blurry, washed out, grainy, over-exposed, etc. etc. Merde, as they say in France. To release such a poor quality product shows contempt for the audience. It is really bad. Painful to watch. Camera also over-does the facial close-ups at times. (Do we really need to be able to count nose hairs?)The sound includes a DTS sound track, so that should be a good thing. However, the recording is pretty lifeless and far below what you get on SB's CD's. Concert sound tracks are not easy to do, but this is far below what it should have been.It's kind of hard to see what the what exactly the point of this DVD was other than to show that SB can still make it as eye candy. (She surely can.)Disappointing (except for the eye candy aspect).",2,"What happened, Sarah?",1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,1281,"['OK', 'bow', 'one', 'admiration', 'SB', 'singing', 'skills', 'right', 'there', 'Celine', 'top', 'two', 'female', 'vocalists', 'world', 'wife', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', ""CD's.Having"", 'said', 'DVD', 'big', 'disappointment', 'suppose', 'started', 'TV', 'special', 'excuse', 'poor', 'quality', 'video', 'watched', '50', 'Pioneer', 'plasma', 'progressive', 'feed', 'good', 'DVD', 'player', 'video', 'quality', 'far', 'what', 'DVD', 'capable', 'watching', 'poor', 'quality', 'analog', 'TV', 'signal', 'rabbit', 'ears', 'Blurry', 'washed', 'out', 'grainy', 'over-exposed', 'etc', 'etc', 'Merde', 'say', 'France', 'release', 'poor', 'quality', 'product', 'contempt', 'audience', 'really', 'bad', 'Painful', 'watch', 'Camera', 'also', 'facial', 'close-ups', 'times', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'count', 'nose', 'hairs', 'sound', 'DTS', 'sound', 'track', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'However', 'recording', 'pretty', 'lifeless', 'far', 'what', 'get', 'SB', 'CD', 'Concert', 'sound', 'tracks', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'do', 'far', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been.It', 'kind', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'what', 'exactly', 'point', 'DVD', 'was', 'other', 'show', 'SB', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'eye', 'candy', 'surely', 'can', 'Disappointing', 'eye', 'candy', 'aspect']",N/A

856501,A18DON5KI1ERFX,B00062IDHE,"Anthony Morelli ""Woofbear""","[36, 37]","Just bought the DVD and returned home to watch it. Everything is simply amazing! The colors, lights, sound, costumes...it's all great. Even the editing department did great because there's no over-editing. The only thing edited is the wait between the songs & costume changes and the crowd applause has been shortened. So...almost the whole show's there in its entirety. There's lots of audience appreciation this time around, with lots of great audience shots as well!The packaging is simple yet convenient. Everything's as it should be. For the booklet, there's no credits or anything...just enlarged, stunning photos from the show, held into the box with a little clamp on the middle spine of the case. Disc one is gold and Disc 2 is purple. Really pretty!I appreciate having the concert on one DVD, then switching to the 2nd DVD for all the excellent goodies. They left NOTHING out of this production! If you want to get to know the dancers, band members, Frank Peterson and the Director...you've come to the right place with this DVD! I've learned even more about Sarah, just from watching David Mallet, listening to him speak of Sarah from 25 years ago.Dics 2's Photogallery makes me wish I were part of the entourage! It's good to know that Sarah has a wonderful &#34;production&#34; family around her, and not to mention her adoring fans...it's all great. There's a really wonderful remix of a song (which I won't mention), during the photoshoot. You'll love it! I'll say it again...nothing was left out of this production. Sarah's DVDs just get better and better all the time!Look for the special Harem quiz on Disc 2 with a chance to win a very special prize. ;-)Watching the whole concert, it's no wonder Sarah performed to a sold out venue in Vegas! Everything was just right, and of course, we got to see Sarah strutting her stuff in all her glory. The only complaint i've got about the whole thing is the pixellation of the picture (during the entire show). I don't mind though because the closeup shots are remarkable and deadly good! Owning this DVD makes me happy because it was more than &#34;worth the wait&#34;!All vocal aspects of the show are amazing. Sarah has outdone herself this time around! The classical/operatic numbers are amazing and actuallys stunned me! I'm liking certain songs much more now than before. &#34;Nessun Dorma&#34;, &#34;La Luna&#34;, &#34;A question of honour&#34; and &#34;Time to say goodbye&#34; rock! I'm looking forward to watching the whole thing over and over again, really soon! As glittery, entertaining and breathtaking the DVD & actual concert are, there's definitely a whole lot more work going into the production (which we weren't aware of). That's why I like watching the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; parts because we end up appreciating all the aspects of the production of something this big.By far, the DVD outdoes the CD version! Whatever was missing on the CD, we've got quadruple the excitement just on Disc 1! Sarah and her crew are a blessing! I'm going to see Sarah on the 25th of October for a 2nd concert, and the anticipation is even worse after watching the show. I recommend this item to anyone as a gift for Christmas or anytime of the year.

But a plenty of those cameras myst be faulty or mis-selected for the articular job. And/or they spolied the compression.  Whatever, the result is half the time you look at the screen and see fuzzy background and screen artefacts like if you watched a DIV3 version compressed down to 500K.  A shame really.  The 'foreground' is okey but anything considered backgroud is a mess.I admit the setup and the lighting must be pretty hard to record correctly and encoding might press the tech to the limits but QA must have caught the result before going to production. And rearrange the stuff as needed -- there's an excess stereo soundtrack, or the concert could be split on the 2 disks if the bitrate was the only limit.Also the disk has no subtitles. Shame again.

As always the costumes were superb and the stage sets lovely.  The dancing was sensous and intoxicating.  And my favorite song from the Harem album, What A Wonderful World, was included in the concert.Seeing her play the piano was enjoyable as well.

856504,A3KGYTO6CF8MGF,B00062IDHE,"Clarissa ""MoonGoddess""","[40, 42]","As everything Sarah Brightman sets her mind to do, this has been yet another unforgettable concert spectacular captured timelessly and presented to us here to enjoy time and time again. I initially feared this would dim my own ""Harem"" experience in comparison to this sold-out taped/recorded event at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada but thankfully it's not much different so it gives me a wonderful sense of nostalgia as I watch it. Sarah's voice sounds just as pristine as when I saw her live for the first time last March and the sound is amazing when it comes to both the classical and rock musicians whom mostly play in a shallow ravine-like gorge on the stage that does rise on occasion but is hidden for the most part... The props and costumes are as elegant as ever and everyone put on a really great show, which is no surprise at all as her concerts are always quite lavish in proportion with never a dull moment. Of course Sarah could probably mesmerize an audience if only it were her and a microphone... I also enjoyed the exotic group of female dancers and got pleasant chills whenever the spellbinding backing/featured vocalists, Violet, Shweta Shetty and Kadim al-Sahir would lend their talents and sing. Many highlights for me included them; such as ""No One Like You"", ""Arabian Nights"", and ""The War Is Over"" where Sarah plays the piano.

I saw the same concert in South Florida and that night, I swear, she was in even better voice than she was in Vegas two months later. I had heard her do the classic NESSUN DORMA three years before during her La Luna Concert, but this night it was special. On the next to the last note, I felt an overwhelming compulsion that must have been felt throughout the arena, because everyone in my field of vision rose to their feet simultaneously. The outburst of applause drowned out the final note. Folks, we weren't being rude. We couldn't help it. This was a defining moment.In addition to TIME TO SAY GOODBYE and NESSUN DORMA, other standing-ovation songs were WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER, LA LUNA, THE WAR IS OVER, WISHING YOU WERE SOMEHOW HERE AGAIN and A QUESTION OF HONOUR. Ironically, Brightman did LA LUNA better than she had in her La Luna Concert. THE WAR IS OVER was a heart-rending duet for which Brightman wrote lyrics and played the feature accompanying instrument, the piano.What can I say about A QUESTION OF HONOUR? If you have heard Brightman sing it live, you know what I am talking about. If you haven't, you have missed an extraordinary six minutes of entertainment.In my opinion, Brightman was more beautiful, more personable and in finer voice in this concert than in all of her previous concerts.",5,All Rise,1254441600,"10 2, 2009",2009,1769,"['Sometimes', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'good', 'concert', 'audience', 'response', 'was', 'case', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'Live', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Concert', 'front', 'tough', 'audience', 'accustomed', 'best', 'entertainment', 'Brightman', 'received', 'seven', 'standing', 'ovations', 'deserved', 'one', 'Just', 'sang', 'TIME', 'TO', 'SAY', 'GOODBYE', 'man', 'shouted', 'out', 'love', 'Sarah', 'huge', 'smile', 'replied', 'love', 'too', 'What', 'was', 'not', 'love', 'concert', 'saw', 'same', 'concert', 'South', 'Florida', 'night', 'swear', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'voice', 'was', 'Vegas', 'two', 'months', 'later', 'had', 'heard', 'do', 'classic', 'NESSUN', 'DORMA', 'three', 'years', 'La', 'Luna', 'Concert', 'night', 'was', 'special', 'next', 'last', 'note', 'felt', 'overwhelming', 'compulsion', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'felt', 'arena', 'everyone', 'field', 'vision', 'rose', 'feet', 'simultaneously', 'outburst', 'applause', 'drowned', 'out', 'final', 'note', 'Folks', 'were', ""n't"", 'being', 'rude', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'defining', 'moment.In', 'addition', 'TIME', 'TO', 'SAY', 'GOODBYE', 'NESSUN', 'DORMA', 'other', 'standing-ovation', 'songs', 'were', 'WHO', 'WANTS', 'TO', 'LIVE', 'FOREVER', 'LA', 'LUNA', 'THE', 'WAR', 'IS', 'OVER', 'WISHING', 'YOU', 'WERE', 'SOMEHOW', 'HERE', 'AGAIN', 'A', 'QUESTION', 'HONOUR', 'Ironically', 'Brightman', 'did', 'LA', 'LUNA', 'better', 'had', 'La', 'Luna', 'Concert', 'THE', 'WAR', 'IS', 'OVER', 'was', 'heart-rending', 'duet', 'Brightman', 'wrote', 'lyrics', 'played', 'feature', 'accompanying', 'instrument', 'piano.What', 'can', 'say', 'QUESTION', 'HONOUR', 'have', 'heard', 'Brightman', 'sing', 'live', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'have', ""n't"", 'have', 'missed', 'extraordinary', 'six', 'minutes', 'entertainment.In', 'opinion', 'Brightman', 'was', 'more', 'beautiful', 'more', 'personable', 'finer', 'voice', 'concert', 'previous', 'concerts']",N/A

856513,A1OZFMJ2AD2R41,B00062IDHE,Furiae,"[130, 135]","Before my actual review is even to begin, I feel compelled to dispel nonsense about Sarah's supposed lip-synching.  She doesn't.  I made a road trip when she visited the west coast and saw three of her shows consecutively.  If she lip-synchs, she must record a new track every night because each show was different.  These allegations come about because sometimes, her lips don't synch perfectly with the singing.  You'll notice that these instances occur almost always with close-up shots.  The reason for this is this: Her concerts are recorded twice.  She goes through the entire show without an audience so the director can get some nice close-up shots, then she does it for real in front of a live audience.  The reasoning for this method is quite simple.  To get the type of close-ups desired, the camera would be parked up on a crane with a film crew surrounding it right in front of the artist.  A paying audience would riot if cameramen and stagehands were right there on stage hovering around Sarah.  I know this isn't what people really want to know, but the editors have done an absolutely fantastic job putting the show together in a way that is totally seamless.  It really is Sarah singing live, and while the method isn't what people want (I know we all want a DVD that shows footage only from the live audience show), but it's either we get to see her up close this way or we don't.  If you go to her official site's fan section, you'll see they make absolutely no secret of this fact.  In fact, there are photos from the first closed-set taping, which I believe a select group of lucky fans were able to sit in on and watch happen.  Her official camp is absolutely candid about this process, and those who discredit her in their reviews are just ignorant of this process. Now, on to the review...While One Night in Eden has more undeniable charm and La Luna drew us into another world more effectively, this latest concert hallmarks a great period in Sarah Brightman's career.  She pulls all the stops in this one, and the sheer scope of what she puts together is a perfect accompaniment to this point in her career: she is at the top.  If you think only getting the abridged soundtrack is enough to give you a taste of the Harem experience, you're dead wrong.  You'll have to see this DVD, because the audio alone cannot portray the wonderful costumes, dances, and pure theatrics Sarah brings on stage.The costumes are sheer decadence (meaning, of course, they are luxurious and fantastic).  The diva is in top form, both vocally and physically, despite her age of forty-four, which she doesn't look anything like, mind you.  The show is a lighting extravaganza, with the lighting director using each and every method and trick in his arsenol to use each and every bulb to highlight Sarah's presence.  Together with the entourage of dancers who dance around her, Brightman is portrayed almost as a queen straight out of 1001 Arabian Nights.  This, however, is how her fans know her best.  Her shows almost always showcase her as the aloof goddess hovering on stage where her fans may best worship her.  Despite all this, however, she still manages to come across as a warm, personable, charismatic performer.While this concert was a little bit more 'showy' than I prefer seeing her, it was nonetheless dazzling.  Sarah does not share a stage well, though, and she's best when she's the sole object of attention.  The best performances feature her in this way: Who Wants to Live Forever, La Luna, Nessun Dorma (which was amazing), What a Wonderful World (probably the most memorable performance of the concert).  The dancers, however, were terrific during the interludes.  (My only gripe with the dancers was the 'biker chick' number where not only the dances, but the costumes were horribly out of place during the performance of 'Arabian Nights.)  Featured vocalists Violet (n&eacute;e Amelia Brightman, Sarah's youngest sibling), Shwetta Shetty (indipop artist who contributed vocals on the Harem album), and Eli Barak were each brilliant.  Shwetta, especially, is a powerhouse talent that brought much-needed 'ooomph' to Arabian Nights and What a Wonderful World.Harem is a wonderful ride from beginning to end.  She starts off strong with Harem then ends with the ever-crowd-pleasing Question of Honour.  The camera captures each song very well.  There is none of the fast camera changes, funky camera tricks, and downright schizoid camera handlings we've come to know and hate from recent concert releases -- thank God.  (On a side note, I really wish that trend would die.)  The camera is handled reverently, respectfully, and, most of all, maturely.Video noise is the downfall of this DVD.  It was destined to be the pinnacle concert DVD, but the director chose to use film that was subpar to what we expected.  Pictures are not as crisp and clear as they were on La Luna, and the video noise is worse on this DVD than it is on One Night In Eden.  Strangely enough, many scenes seem to be a bit 'smokey' in color.  The color is not as vibrant or clear in some scenes because of this foggy quality.  The worst is during far-away shots, because you can barely make out her face due to the video noise.  For this reason, La Luna still ranks #1 as being the best DVD.  Sound, however, on Harem Live is lush, rich, and everything I expected it to be.  You can definitely see the images, and the only reason it was distracting for me was because I was expecting something just as good (or better) than La Luna when it came to video quality.  Everything does show up well and it is watchable, don't get me wrong.  I just wish video quality was better, because Brightman's concerts are such a visual feast for the eyes.The extras on the second disc include some entertaining interviews with her entourage.  It also includes a photo sequence that shows various photos, and while it plays, a few remixes of Harem songs play in the background -- worth listening to if you enjoyed the Harem album!  There's also a video quiz that is quite infuriating, but the prize is a password to access a prize on the official site (this offer may or may not be still available, since it was a limited time offer).  I finished the quiz and got my prize from the official site which was free photos of Sarah in concert from the Harem Tour called 'The Signature Collection.'  I paid for s/h, of course, but that's more than fair.All in all, this concert is still a must-have.  It is a triumphant extravaganza sure to please fans and non-fans alike.  It's a spectacle, and ranks high as one of my favorite concerts.",5,Highly entertaining!,1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,6613,"['actual', 'review', 'even', 'begin', 'feel', 'compelled', 'dispel',

856519,A2PBDKMVQHIKR4,B00062IDHE,"Michael Joseph ""mikkj1""","[8, 9]","I give my five-star rating to Sarah Brightman, the back-up singers, dancers, musicians, set designers, and costumers. The DVD production and direction are another matter.This is the second DVD of Sarah's (the other being ""Harem: Desert Fantasy) in which the lighting was, at times, so bright as to nearly, or completely, obscure our view of her. I lost count of the number of times the camera wound up pointed directly into a spotlight. If this much lighting was needed for the benefit of the audience, they should have been prepared with filters for the cameras. As any fan of Sarah Brightman knows, when she is performing, it doesn't take special lighting for her to glow.Next, the constant cutting to different camera angles, and shots of the back-up singers, musicians, and dancers, was distracting, and often took us away from key moments of Sarah's performance. When she was dancing, or singing a particularly important part of a song, I did not need a shot from the ceiling at the back of the auditorium, pointed into a spotlight, or of a piano/violin player. All of these people deserve camera time, but at the appropriate moments, not just because you have the shot. This direction, and editing, reminded me of the music video explosion in the 1980's on MTV. ""Music video director"" suddenly became a lucrative job, and often a gateway to bigger things. So every fledgling director pulled every video effect he/she had out of their bag of tricks, and wound up giving us some of the most horrendous music videos of all time. The purpose of these music videos, as it ought to be with a production like this one, SHOULD be to present the artist(s) in a favorable light, and compliment the music. What they wound up doing, and what happened at times here, was that the artist was obscured, and the music overwhelmed. Some artists never recovered from these disasters. I got that feeling as I watched this DVD. It seemed that they were so proud of having so many cameras covering this show, that they wanted to make sure that they used ALL of them on every song.To sum up, this DVD is MORE than worth owning, since Sarah, cast and crew, completely overcome this misuse of artistic license, and triumph over it all. To directors, editors, cinematographers, lighting techs out there, PLEASE remember that an artist like Sarah Brightman doesn't need much embellishment (watch ""La Luna"" - practically bare stage most of the time - and wonderful!), and remember that in the term ""musical production"" ""production"" is the SECOND word.",5,Priorities - Please!,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,2530,"['give', 'five-star', 'rating', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'back-up', 'singers', 'dancers', 'musicians', 'set', 'designers', 'costumers', 'DVD', 'production', 'direction', 'are', 'matter.This', 'second', 'DVD', 'Sarah', 'other', 'being', 'Harem', 'Desert', 'Fantasy', 'lighting', 'was', 'times', 'so', 'bright', 'nearly', 'completely', 'obscure', 'view', 'lost', 'count', 'number', 'times', 'camera', 'wound', 'up', 'pointed', 'directly', 'spotlight', 'much', 'lighting', 'was', 'needed', 'benefit', 'audience', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'prepared', 'filters', 'cameras', 'fan', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'when', 'performing', ""n't"", 'take', 'special', 'lighting', 'glow.Next', 'constant', 'cutting', 'different', 'camera', 'angles', 'shots', 'back-up', 'singers', 'musicians', 'dancers', 'was', 'distracting', 'often', 'took', 'away', 'key', 'moments', 'Sarah', 'performance', 'When', 'was', 'dancing', 'singing', 'particularly', 'important', 'part', 'song', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'shot', 'ceiling', 'back', 'auditorium', 'pointed', 'spotlight', 'piano/violin', 'player', 'people', 'deserve', 'camera', 'time', 'appropriate', 'moments', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'shot', 'direction', 'editing', 'reminded', 'music', 'video', 'explosion', '1980', 'MTV', 'Music', 'video', 'director', 'suddenly', 'became', 'lucrative', 'job', 'often', 'gateway', 'bigger', 'things', 'So', 'fledgling', 'director', 'pulled', 'video', 'effect', 'he/she', 'had', 'bag', 'tricks', 'wound', 'up', 'giving', 'most', 'horrendous', 'music', 'videos', 'time', 'purpose', 'music', 'videos', 'ought', 'be', 'production', 'one', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'present', 'artist', 's', 'favorable', 'light', 'compliment', 'music', 'What', 'wound', 'up', 'doing', 'what', 'happened', 'times', 'here', 'was', 'artist', 'was', 'obscured', 'music', 'overwhelmed', 'artists', 'never', 'recovered', 'disasters', 'got', 'that', 'feeling', 'watched', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'were', 'so', 'proud', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'cameras', 'covering', 'show', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'used', 'ALL', 'song.To', 'up', 'DVD', 'MORE', 'worth', 'owning', 'Sarah', 'cast', 'crew', 'completely', 'misuse', 'artistic', 'license', 'triumph', 'directors', 'editors', 'cinematographers', 'lighting', 'there', 'PLEASE', 'remember', 'artist', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'embellishment', 'watch', 'La', 'Luna', 'practically', 'bare', 'stage', 'most', 'time', 'wonderful', 'remember', 'term', 'musical', 'production', 'production', 'SECOND', 'word']",N/A

But Sarah gave us back $2.00 for each dollar we spent. (Note: If you go, do not buy the expensive seats on the floor around the stage. You can't see the whole show and huge stage unless you sit in seats that are up and away from the floor.)First thing you see is the giant incense pot. The whole stadium was smoky, smelled exotic and put everyone in the mood. Then the tall, brightly colored curtain, the very loud music-- kind of too loud, but you get so caught up in the beautiful pieces she has selected. Then the dancing girls, the costumes, the great lighting. Some songs like Wonderful World had tons of red, pink and white confetti falling into the audience.Intoxicating and pulls the audience into the show too.For the final song,Sarah literally brings down the house with A Question of Honor (my favorite) with swirling confetti, lights and a tremendous explosion at the end.I have become a huge fan and I am now buying up all her CD's. The world is full of ugliness in the Arts anymore: filthy rappers, thugs, and other foul creatures that fancy themselves artists. Sarah Brightman has a huge talent and presence and the perfection she exposes us to in her concert gives me hope for the human race, and respite for all the cruelty and evil we see today.",5,You MUST See A Sarah Brightman Concert Before You Die,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,1376,"['was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'last', 'year', ""'d"", 'never', 'been', 'concert', 'kind', 'tickets', 'were', 'expensive', 'Sarah', 'gave', 'back', '2.00', 'dollar', 'spent', 'Note', 'go', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'expensive', 'seats', 'floor', 'stage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'whole', 'show', 'huge', 'stage', 'sit', 'seats', 'are', 'up', 'away', 'floor', 'First', 'thing', 'see', 'giant', 'incense', 'pot', 'whole', 'stadium', 'was', 'smoky', 'smelled', 'exotic', 'put', 'everyone', 'mood', 'Then', 'tall', 'brightly', 'colored', 'curtain', 'very', 'loud', 'music', 'kind', 'too', 'loud', 'get', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'beautiful', 'pieces', 'selected', 'Then', 'dancing', 'girls', 'costumes', 'great', 'lighting', 'songs', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'had', 'tons', 'red', 'pink', 'white', 'confetti', 'falling', 'audience.Intoxicating', 'audience', 'show', 'final', 'song', 'Sarah', 'literally', 'down', 'house', 'Question', 'Honor', 'favorite', 'swirling', 'confetti', 'lights', 'tremendous', 'explosion', 'end.I', 'have', 'become', 'huge', 'fan', 'am', 'now', 'buying', 'up', 'CD', 'world', 'full', 'ugliness', 'Arts', 'anymore', 'filthy', 'rappers', 'thugs', 'other', 'foul', 'creatures', 'fancy', 'artists', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'huge', 'talent', 'presence', 'perfection', 'concert', 'hope', 'human', 'race', 'respite', 'cruelty', 'evil', 'see', 'today']",N/A
856521,AMX4202M7D7HV,B00062IDHE,"M. Secaur ""Meredith Secaur""","[1, 1]","Sarah Brightman is without a doubt one of the most gifted singers of our age. I have been impressed with her for many years, by both her great talent and vivacity as a person and as a performer. In any of her artistic endeavors, she always gives 200% with an unmatched zeal and enthusiasm, and Harem: Live in Las Vegas is no exception. In this concert, filmed live at MGM Grand in Las Vegas, she takes you on a journey through the mythical land of the East, to a completely new brand of escapisim completely Ms. Brightman's own.Visually stunning, this DVD rivals actually being there in person. Indeed, with the great close-ups and numerous fly-around shots, you get a complete, 360 degree experience of one fantastic concert. There are so many effects and stage devices employed such a thing could only come out of Las Vegas. Teamed with Sarah are a troupe of belly-dancers and a few guest-backup singers, including her younger sister Violet.Though everything about Harem is very different in terms of look and lineup than her previous concerts (for example, her very conventional, classical-minded performance at Royal Albert Hall back in 1997), the differences make this exciting to watch, and shows off Sarah at her best as an actress, singer, dancer, musician, stunt-woman, and generally one-woman show. During the course of the nearly two-hour show, she sings 20 songs, changes costumes at least 10 times, and also performs some rather daring feats of acrobatic and technical skill, which she puts through masterfully, all without batting an eye. Her voice is in top form here, never wavering in its beauty and strength for an instant, and is as clear and pure as always. She also looks wonderful, and radiates a queenly, confident elegance as her role as the sensual, mythical, Eastern princess.She is a flawless performer, and is always perfectly calm and relaxed, whether standing on the mainstage, parading back and forth across a long catwalk that juts out into the auditorium, or swinging over the audience on a giant swing fifteen feet up. Clearly, she is fearless. Her dancer's instinct is spot on, and as well as showing her great prowess for both song and dance, adds another interesting aspect to this concert as she helps meld both music and movement together into a seamless, enagaging spectacle.The show's opening song, aptly named ""Harem"", with lyrics by Brightman, is a catchy, Middle-Eastern-infused eye-popper, and is a great introduction into the fantastic and seductive world of Arabian fantasy which is so apparent throughout the whole of the show.Though I was not initially a fan of the more pop/rock oriented songs in Sarah Brightman's repertoire, after seeing ""Harem"" I've reformed. I enjoy all of the songs presented in this concert, especially the ones which Brightman combines her talents for operatic and popular together in one song. I had never heard most of these songs before, but I think her performance here rivals anything that she has previously recorded. Some standouts include ""La Luna"",which absolutely took my breath away,""Stranger in Paradise"", ""Nessun Dorma"", ""Anytime, Anywhere"", and her edgy yet lyrical interpretation of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"",which has since become an enduring favorite of mine. She also has some old favorites from ""Phantom"", as well as a great solo of ""Time To Say Goodbye"", which was especially good.Disc 2 has a plethora of special features, including some great back-stage glimpses of how the whole concert was put together, as well as an in-DVD quiz and photo gallery.In closing, ""Harem"" is a unique show that has all the glitz and glamour you could want in a concert, and with a bright star like Sarah Brightman leading it, is one thrill-ride not to be missed. The combination of the music, lighting, costumes, talent and choreography makes this show unforgettable, and is definitely something worth watching many times over.",5,Welcome to the Harem: A Feast for the Eyes and Ears!,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,3903,"['Sarah', 'Brightman', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'singers', 'age', 'have', 'been', 'impressed', 'many', 'years', 'great', 'talent', 'vivacity', 'person', 'performer', 'artistic', 'endeavors', 'always', '200', '%', 'unmatched', 'zeal', 'enthusiasm', 'Harem', 'Live', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'exception', 'concert', 'filmed', 'live', 'MGM', 'Grand', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'journey', 'mythical', 'land', 'East', 'completely', 'new', 'brand', 'escapisim', 'completely', 'Ms.', 'Brightman', 'own.Visually', 'stunning', 'DVD', 'actually', 'being', 'person', 'Indeed', 'great', 'close-ups', 'numerous', 'fly-around', 'shots', 'get', 'complete', '360', 'degree', 'experience', 'one', 'fantastic', 'concert', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'effects', 'stage', 'devices', 'employed', 'thing', 'could', 'only', 'come', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Teamed', 'Sarah', 'are', 'troupe', 'belly-dancers', 'few', 'guest-backup', 'singers', 'including', 'younger', 'sister', 'Violet.Though', 'everything', 'Harem', 'very', 'different', 'terms', 'look', 'lineup', 'previous', 'concerts', 'example', 'very', 'conventional', 'classical-minded', 'performance', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'back', '1997', 'differences', 'make', 'exciting', 'watch', 'off', 'Sarah', 'best', 'actress', 'singer', 'dancer', 'musician', 'stunt-woman', 'generally', 'one-woman', 'show', 'course', 'nearly', 'two-hour', 'show', '20', 'songs', 'changes', 'costumes', 'least', '10', 'times', 'also', 'performs', 'rather', 'daring', 'feats', 'acrobatic', 'technical', 'skill', 'masterfully', 'batting', 'eye', 'voice', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'never', 'wavering', 'beauty', 'strength', 'instant', 'clear', 'pure', 'always', 'also', 'wonderful', 'queenly', 'confident', 'elegance', 'role', 'sensual', 'mythical', 'Eastern', 'princess.She', 'flawless', 'performer', 'always', 'perfectly', 'calm', 'relaxed', 'standing', 'mainstage', 'parading', 'back', 'forth', 'long', 'catwalk', 'out', 'auditorium', 'swinging', 'audience', 'giant', 'swing', 'fifteen', 'feet', 'up', 'Clearly', 'fearless', 'dancer', 'instinct', 'spot', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'great', 'prowess', 'song', 'dance', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'concert', 'meld', 'music', 'movement', 'together', 'seamless', 'enagaging', 'spectacle.The', 'show', 'opening', 'song', 'aptly', 'named', 'Harem', 'lyrics', 'Brightman', 'catchy', 'Middle-Eastern-infused', 'eye-popper', 'great', 'introduction', 'fantastic', 'seductive', 'world', 'Arabian', 'fantasy', 'so', 'apparent', 'whole', 'show.Though', 'was', 'not', 'initially', 'fan', 'more', 'pop/rock', 'oriented', 'songs', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'repertoire', 'seeing', 'Harem', ""'ve"", 'reformed', 'enjoy', 'songs', 'presented', 'concert', 'especially', 'ones', 'Brightman', 'talents', 'operatic', 'popular', 'together', 'one', 'song', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'most', 'songs', 'think', 'performance', 'here', 'anything', 'previously', 'recorded', 'standouts', 'include', 'La', 'Luna', 'absolutely', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'Stranger', 'Paradise', 'Nessun', 'Dorma', 'Anytime', 'Anywhere', 'edgy', 'yet', 'lyrical', 'interpretation', 'A', 'Whiter', 'Shade', 'Pale', 'become', 'enduring', 'favorite', 'mine', 'also', 'old', 'favorites', 'Phantom', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'solo', 'Time', 'Say', 'Goodbye', 'was', 'especially', 'good.Disc', '2', 'plethora', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'great', 'back-stage', 'glimpses', 'how', 'whole', 'concert', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'in-DVD', 'quiz', 'photo', 'gallery.In', 'closing', 'Harem', 'unique', 'show', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'could', 'want', 'concert', 'bright', 'star', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'leading', 'one', 'thrill-ride', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'combination', 'music', 'lighting', 'costumes', 'talent', 'choreography', 'show', 'unforgettable', 'definitely', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'many', 'times']",N/A
856522,A3FOSBM4MMUFER,B00062IDHE,Randal J. Batty,"[2, 2]","This DVD is not a straight transfer of Sarah's ""Harem"" CD.  The DVD depicts a live performance in Las Vegas, and Sarah purposely mixes songs from ""Harem"" with known crowd-pleasers.  I thought the DVD was outstanding and sent two extra copies to people who knew nothing about Sarah Brightman.  The most telling point in whether the DVD is worth purchasing or not is validated by the crowd reaction.  I can only describe it as unbridled joy.  Sarah performs before a huge crowd that is engulfed and aroused by her performance, and, I would say, deservedly so.  Watching Sarah Brightman perform live is a unique experience.  I was impressed by just how much effort/energy she put into each song.  Knowing that the Vegas stop was just part of her tour, I was awestruck by the degree to which Sarah immersed herself into the total performance.  Seemingly, she appears to go into an alternate state of consciousness.  The viewer is also presented with a terrifically produced, painstakingly conceived stage performance, with all the extras.  Some of the songs (especially the intro) sound more soul-shaking and electric than presented on ""Harem.""  The price of admission is worth it just to watch Sarah walking up and down the stage in amazingly high platform heels.  For the sake of balance, she undulates foreward by swiveling her hips in an exaggerated fashion, thereby giving everyone a glimpse of her gams and ability to defy gravity.  There is nothing slutty here.  Sarah always maintains her charm, poise, confidence and professionalism (with a calculated level of allure).  Above all, though, it's the energy and appreciation of the crowd that makes this worth the purchase.  Unlike the sedate response given by Sarah's live ""Symphony"" performance in Europe, the Vegas crowd creates a singular, spontaneous outpouring of adulation -- which really makes the viewer feel as if he/she is part of this lucky crowd.

The lighting director was an expert. The orchestration was superb. Great production ideas. Creative stage variations for different songs was done well.

I can't wait for her next totally new show with totally new songs for the new concert in the future.

Yes, I believe she has the best female voice in the world. And she is so beautiful too and feminine in an age of ugly femininists. Such range from pop songs to opera. How can she sing all those songs so well ? - it's that gifted voice from God. Now most opera songs are boring, but this Diva selects the best of the opera songs from various operas and takes them to a new level.

She is absolutely on top form, both vocally and physically.Las Vegas audiences are used to seeing the best artists in the world as a matter of routine, so when you get a Vegas audience eating out of your hand the way Sarah did, you know you've got an act! The way her exquisite voice was still so strong and clear in the finale just sent the highly appreciative audience into raptures.The first time I ever saw this DVD, I watched it with a female friend who is taking classical voice training, and she laughed every time the divinely leggy Sarah came strutting down the long catwalk in a series of beautifully designed outfits. Her comment was ""Yeah, she knows how good she looks!""Sarah is one of the few great Divas who, along with Tina Turner, can surround herself with beautiful young dancers and still be confident that all eyes will be on her. And they were.The track selection is excellent, and although we all have our preferences, many of her classic pieces are to be found here. The second DVD is a real bonus and gives you some extraordinary insights into the whole Sarah phenomenon.I actually like all of Sarah's concert DVDs, but with this being the most recent, this is the one that I am playing to death.Absolutely wonderful.",5,The lady does it again,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,1333,"['Anyone', 'who', 'hoping', 'Sarah', 'show', 'signs', 'weakness', 'will', 'be', 'devastated', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'top', 'form', 'vocally', 'physically.Las', 'Vegas', 'audiences', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'best', 'artists', 'world', 'matter', 'routine', 'so', 'when', 'get', 'Vegas', 'audience', 'eating', 'hand', 'way', 'Sarah', 'did', 'know', ""'ve"", 'got', 'act', 'way', 'exquisite', 'voice', 'was', 'still', 'so', 'strong', 'clear', 'finale', 'just', 'sent', 'highly', 'appreciative', 'audience', 'raptures.The', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'DVD', 'watched', 'female', 'friend', 'who', 'taking', 'classical', 'voice', 'training', 'laughed', 'time', 'divinely', 'leggy', 'Sarah', 'came', 'strutting', 'down', 'long', 'catwalk', 'series', 'beautifully', 'designed', 'outfits', 'comment', 'was', 'Yeah', 'how', 'good', 'Sarah', 'one', 'few', 'great', 'Divas', 'who', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'can', 'surround', 'beautiful', 'young', 'dancers', 'still', 'be', 'confident', 'eyes', 'will', 'be', 'were.The', 'track', 'selection', 'excellent', 'have', 'preferences', 'many', 'classic', 'pieces', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'second', 'DVD', 'real', 'bonus', 'extraordinary', 'insights', 'whole', 'Sarah', 'phenomenon.I', 'actually', 'Sarah', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'being', 'most', 'recent', 'one', 'am', 'playing', 'death.Absolutely', 'wonderful']",N/A
