She is very talented and I found myself looking for more of her work after seeing this film. The story is about a Lesbian who has a family that is traditionally Indian and the issues that come up when her sister is unable to have a child. There are also some good scenes between her and her girlfriend.It is simply charming.  I love the opening where you watch her doing traditional henna tattoos and I love and will never forget the scene (not much of a spoiler here) where she is sitting on a park bench with her mother and she suggests ( to her traditional Indian mother) that her grandmother could have been a lesbian.

The premise is that the girlfriend of a lesbian whose sister is infertile volunteers to be a surrogate mother.  But after 45 minutes we still hadn't gotten to the premise.  Instead, we had barely audible scenes of the lesbian couple and their friends gossiping about irrelevancies, the lesbian star being oppressed by her traditional East Indian family for being a lesbian, and the sister pining and whining over not being able to make babies.I'm a lesbian myself and always looking for realistic depictions of lesbian life in film, so I was interested in seeing this movie.  I was also happy to see that it was made by and starred an Indian woman.  So I was prepared to like ""Chutney Popcorn"" and was more than a little disappointed at its amateurish production values, bad writing and bad acting.

662392,A1FAWFMP6CDKG,B00005KJP0,David Kleist,"[1, 1]","For unknown reasons, I could hear in my head the vindictive (and hopefully fictional!) voice of a fundamentalist preacher condemning the &quot;unnatural acts of sinful love&quot; of this film's main characters.In actuality, this is a movie about the true meanings in contemporary America of &quot;love,&quot;  &quot;family,&quot; and &quot;culture,&quot; and it grapples admirably with the changing social and personal-relationship patterns brought about by modern notions of democracy and freedom. Lisa and Reena are truly in love, and their families truly love them as well; but how are all these individuals to deal with Reena's choice to carry to term the baby she is producing through artificial insemination (using her brother-in-law's sperm)? Reena's sister has decided that she no longer WANTS a baby (she herself, biologically, cannot provide the egg for the child-to-be); however, Reena has decided SHE wants the baby, while Reena's female lover doesn't wish to become part of a &quot;traditional&quot; nuclear family.The moral dilemmas here are both comic and real, absurd yet earnest, and the film explores all sides of its issues with grace and poise and humor. I'm astonished at the clever blocking of the film (such clever tricks for a low-budget effort!), such as when Reena is shown in half-profile before a mirror, or when Lisa falls off the sofa. This is a highly satisfying piece of cinema which I discovered purely by accident among the sale tapes at my local Blockbuster.I look forward to more films by this original, brave, and highly intelligent director.

Nisha Ganatra should not have cast herself in the lead role because the range of her skills as an actor is dull and limited. The central plot, when you stop to think about it, verges on the offensive: a heterosexual woman is unable to conceive, the lesbian sister decides to be her sibling's surrogate by impregnating herself with her brother-in-law's sperm...and to hell with whatever her lesbian partner thinks and feels about it because she can take it or leave it. The theme of helping the sister's dream come true may be noble, but forcing a child upon the significant other regardless of her opinions and feelings on the matter, and the ramifications this may have on the relationship, is a narcissistic premise. Furthermore, it is an exercise in ludicrous melodrama for the filmmaker to throw a wrench into the story by having the barren sister (who longed so thoroughly to be a mother) decide mid-stream that she no longer wanted to accept a child created by her husband and sibling. This movie is mostly about motherhood and making a baby -- the lesbian angle was thrown in to make it seem unconventional.",2,About making & having babies.

662395,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005KJP0,Lawyeraau,"[13, 17]","This is a decent directorial effort by Nisha Ganatra, in this film about families, lesbian lovers, and cultural divides. This film is her first feature film and it shows in its somewhat amateurish constructs. Still, there are some flashes of promise.Reena (Nisha Ganatra), an artist of Indian descent, and Lisa (Jill Hennessey of Law and Order and Crossing Jordan fame) are lovers, despite the fact that Reena's tradition bound Indian mother is in total denial. She is still trying to match Reena up with a member of the opposite sex, refusing to acknowledge Lisa as anything other than Reena's roommate.When Sarita (Sakina Jeffrey), Reena's older sister gets married, she soon discovers that she is infertile. Reena offers to be a surrogate mom, and Sarita initially agrees. After some failed attempts through a fertility clinic, Reena, with the cooperation of Sarita's husband, Mitch, decides to get pregnant the old fashioned way, at home by using a turkey baster. She succeeds where the specialists failed.Unfortunately, this causes problems with her relationship with Lisa, who is initially unable to come to terms with Reena's pregnancy and what it will mean to their relationship. Sarita is also having difficulty, changing her mind when it is too late to turn back. She sees it as a reminder of her own failing and questions the impact that it will have on her life and marriage. Reena's and Sarita's mother, however, grasps the irony of the situation, and eventually comes to terms with it, as well as with the nature of Reena's and Lisa's relationship.Nisha Ganatra should have concentrated on just directing this film, rather than acting in it, as she is no actress and is the weak link in the cast. Moreover, there appears to be little chemistry between her and Jill Hennessey, which does not help the film. There are, however, some very funny moments in this moderately entertaining film, having mostly to do with the character of the mother.As a director Ms. Ganatra displays some promise.

Multi-talented Ganatra (writer, producer and director) stars as ""Reena,"" very much the black sheep of the family, not only due to her vocation (she's a photographer), but also because of her lesbianism. Her newlywed sibling, Sarita, played by Sakina Jeffrey), finds out she is infertile and that's when the games begin!Entangled in the fertility games is Reena's commitment-phobic girlfriend, Lisa (Crossing Jordan's Jill Hennessy), Sarita's husband, Mitch, and the girls' mother, an ever-meddlesome, traditional Indian woman. Momma is horrified when Reena decides to step up to the plate and offer herself as a surrogate for Mitch's sperm, Lisa feels the commitment rope tightening around her throat at the announcement, and Sarita begins to have second doubts about the baby.The ensuing tale is a delight as Reena and Lisa begin the ""turkey baster"" ritual, and the cast of characters decide to share their infinite wisdom regarding a dyke bringing a child into the world. Scene after scene is filled with belly laughs, especially after one poignant ""turkey baster"" moment between Reena and Lisa.Of course, any lesbian movie worth its salt must have a few moments of dyke drama, and ""Chutney Popcorn"" doesn't disappoint. It's only a matter of time before Sarita really has a problem with her dyke sister giving birth to her husband's child, and Lisa feels the burden of a baby is entirely too much for her. Add in pressure from Momma to ""get a husband,"" backlash from her politically-correct dyke friends and her own journey of self-awareness as the baby grows, and you have a melting pot of emotion, laughter and tears.""Chutney Popcorn"" not only brings a good laugh, but it also opens our eyes to dilemmas that lesbians face everyday in regards to vocation choices, relationship decisions, and familial dynamics. You'll leave the film with a smile on your face, and thoughts to ponder.
