I can say though, it was a very, very , very strange movie. One minute the tortured patient (Robert Downey) is surrounded by doctors, the next- they're all singing and dancing 'the hop' while the hospital room morphs into a dance floor. It then goes into some distasteful scenes with more Robert Downey as he investigates who he is- a patient or a  detective from his own novel. Mel Gibson's tiny role as the psychotherapist was to help explore that. Carla Gugina's tiny role was as his mother in his earliest memories- whom he thought commited suicide, but is now figuring out she was murdered.

798433,A103KNDW8GN92L,B0001AW04I,David Hugaert,"[2, 3]","""The Singing Detective"" may not be an obvious pick for ""Best Picture of 2003"" honors, but it gets my vote for underground hit of the year. Hospitalized as the result of a rare skin disorder, novelist Dan Dark (Robert Downey, Jr.) drifts into a subconscious world of fantasy lore, and imagines himself as a gangster to escape the harsh reality of his existing condition. What follows is a drama/comedy/musical that'll have a dual effect on ""The Singing Detective""'s audience - in that it will have you both laughing and crying at the same time. To help the proceedings along, a semi-all-star cast is on hand, which includes Alfre Woodard (as a hospital chief of staff) and Mel Gibson (as Dan Dark's psychoanalyst). To top it all off, the film's soundtrack, featuring 1950s and '60s tunes helps paint a spectacular picture, in that it provides an interesting backdrop for the storyline. If there's one minor flaw to this picture, it would have to be the makeup job of Robert Downey, Jr.. In far-away shots, it looks perfect and masterful - but in closeups, it pretty much looks ""paint-by-numbers"" (nonetheless being unappetizing when one is consuming refreshments during the movie!). Nevertheless, ""The Singing Detective"", in terms of layout and cinematic preciseness, has Cannes Film Festival subleties craftfully etched inside its durable craftsmanship.

798434,A1IPFS2WVJ1XP8,B0001AW04I,Dorian Tenore-Bartilucci,"[0, 0]","The 2003 film version of THE SINGING DETECTIVE is by turns funny, scathing, and poignant, a woefully underrated look into a writer's psyche. If you don't have time to watch Dennis Potter's landmark TV miniseries (also available on home video), Potter's screenplay for this movie version (written 2 years before his untimely death) does a great job of condensing the story of novelist Dan Dark's (Robert Downey Jr.) battle with severe chronic psoriasis and personal demons. Throughout the movie, the bitter, suffering Dark weaves in and out of reality and delirious re-imaginings of the people and events in his life as they'd appear in the titular novel starring Dark's tough private eye alter ego. Actor-turned-director Keith Gordon stages this wild ride through Dark's mind with a style that owes as much to David Lynch and the Coen Brothers as it does to Potter. The British miniseries' lip-synched 1940s musical set pieces are retooled as American 1950s rock 'n' roll numbers -- call me a Philistine, but I think the updating works even better than the original (and believe me, I loved the original)! As a writer, I found THE SINGING DETECTIVE to be a fine example of how one's life and experiences creep into one's writing no matter what genre you write in. Each and every member of the stellar cast is letter-perfect, with particularly good, sharp chemistry between Downey and, respectively, Robin Wright Penn (I've always loved her name; it's especially appropriate for someone playing a writer's wife :-), and producer Mel Gibson (as Dark's seemingly goofy but astute and compassionate therapist, Gibson is all but unrecognizable in bald drag; Greg Cannom's F/X makeup serves both Gibson and Downey well. In fact, Downey's psoriasis makeup is so good you might not want to watch this while eating!). It's a shame THE SINGING DETECTIVE didn't do better with critics or at the box office, or Downey probably would've been a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination. I could empathize with Downey as the angry, clever, pain-racked (physically and emotionally) Dan Dark even when he wasn't particularly likable. The versatile Downey could be a Bogart for the Aughties if he could keep his own personal demons under control. I also enjoyed seeing our household fave Adrien Brody in a relatively lighthearted (for this film :-) role as one of a pair of Dark's fictional hoods with a bumbling streak. Jon Polito completes the pair; he and Brody are like an amoral Abbott &amp; Costello. Their repartee cracked me up, especially their &quot;Patti Page&quot; exchange early in the film (just watching Brody mouthing the barks in &quot;How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?&quot; is worth the rental price! :-). Give this new SINGING DETECTIVE a try next time you're in the video store and in the mood for something different. If you rent the DVD and like it, watch it again with Keith Gordon's commentary track on; he has lots of intriguing and entertaining things to say about the making of the film, particularly about the cast and how he and his crew got those great surreal effects on a low budget.",4,Great Cast &amp; Direction Drive Compelling Potter Update,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",2004,3094,"['2003', 'film', 'version', 'THE', 'SINGING', 'DETECTIVE', 'turns', 'funny', 'scathing', 'poignant', 'woefully', 'underrated', 'look', 'writer', 'psyche', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'Dennis', 'Potter', 'landmark', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'also', 'available', 'home', 'video', 'Potter', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'version', 'written', '2', 'years', 'untimely', 'death', 'great', 'job', 'condensing', 'story', 'novelist', 'Dan', 'Dark', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'battle', 'severe', 'chronic', 'psoriasis', 'personal', 'demons', 'movie', 'bitter', 'suffering', 'Dark', 'weaves', 'reality', 'delirious', 're-imaginings', 'people', 'events', 'life', ""'d"", 'appear', 'titular', 'novel', 'starring', 'Dark', 'tough', 'private', 'eye', 'alter', 'ego', 'Actor-turned-director', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'wild', 'ride', 'Dark', 'mind', 'style', 'as', 'much', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Potter', 'British', 'miniseries', 'lip-synched', '1940s', 'musical', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'retooled', 'American', '1950s', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'numbers', 'call', 'Philistine', 'think', 'updating', 'even', 'better', 'original', 'believe', 'loved', 'original', 'writer', 'found', 'THE', 'SINGING', 'DETECTIVE', 'be', 'fine', 'example', 'how', 'one', 'life', 'experiences', 'creep', 'one', 'writing', 'matter', 'what', 'write', 'member', 'stellar', 'cast', 'letter-perfect', 'particularly', 'good', 'sharp', 'chemistry', 'Downey', 'respectively', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'name', 'especially', 'appropriate', 'someone', 'playing', 'writer', 'wife', 'producer', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Dark', 'seemingly', 'goofy', 'astute', 'compassionate', 'therapist', 'Gibson', 'unrecognizable', 'bald', 'drag', 'Greg', 'Cannom', 'F/X', 'makeup', 'Gibson', 'Downey', 'well', 'fact', 'Downey', 'psoriasis', 'makeup', 'so', 'good', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'eating', 'shame', 'THE', 'SINGING', 'DETECTIVE', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'critics', 'box', 'office', 'Downey', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shoo-in', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'could', 'empathize', 'Downey', 'angry', 'clever', 'pain-racked', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'Dan', 'Dark', 'even', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'likable', 'versatile', 'Downey', 'could', 'be', 'Bogart', 'Aughties', 'could', 'keep', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'control', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'household', 'fave', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'relatively', 'lighthearted', 'film', 'role', 'one', 'pair', 'Dark', 'fictional', 'hoods', 'bumbling', 'streak', 'Jon', 'Polito', 'pair', 'Brody', 'are', 'amoral', 'Abbott', 'amp', 'Costello', 'repartee', 'cracked', 'up', 'especially', 'quot', 'Patti', 'Page', 'quot', 'exchange', 'early', 'film', 'just', 'watching', 'Brody', 'mouthing', 'barks', 'quot', 'How', 'Much', 'Doggie', 'Window', 'quot', 'rental', 'price', 'Give', 'new', 'SINGING', 'DETECTIVE', 'try', 'next', 'time', ""'re"", 'video', 'store', 'mood', 'something', 'different', 'rent', 'DVD', 'watch', 'again', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'commentary', 'track', 'lots', 'intriguing', 'entertaining', 'things', 'say', 'making', 'film', 'particularly', 'cast', 'how', 'crew', 'got', 'great', 'surreal', 'effects', 'low', 'budget']",The Singing Detective

798440,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,B0001AW04I,Jason Horsley,"[5, 5]","The film is a strange animal, all right, a work sans genre, and at times Gordon seems to have overreached himself, grasping for effects he isn't quite able to achieve. The various styles, moods, and genres give the film a slightly garish, amateurish feel, yet in the end (perhaps consciously on Gordon's part) this very awkwardness works in the film's favor. The Singing Detective is a remarkably ingenuous work, fresh and daring, almost childlike in its lack of pretension, and easily one of the most original American movies of the last twenty years. Above all, it showcases Robert Downey Jr.'s raging, embittered psoriasis-afflicted pulp writer, inside whose head the whole movie (more or less) takes place, and Downey gives an inventive, powerful performance, what may be the apotheosis of his enormous talent. Praise for Downey notwithstanding, on its release Gordon's film met with a wall of critical resistance, a veritable consensus of contempt. This may have been due in part (in the UK at least) to a fondness for Potter's original TV series; but it was perhaps due even more to the basic incompatibility of Potter's idiosyncratic, scathing vision with mainstream (critical) tastes.  Whatever the case, the movie once again tragically failed to find its audience.As with his previous adaptations, Gordon respected the source material without revering it, and as a director, he has a rare gift: the ability to fuse his own sensibility and talents with his subject at a fundamental level. In the case of The Singing Detective, it was a somewhat less seamless fusion; Potter's vision (his bizarre blend of musical fantasy with bleak psychological realism) was so startlingly original it required another sensibility at least as strong and eccentric to fuse with. Gordon doesn't quite possess (yet) the surrealist gifts to make Potter's vision his own, or to take it to the next level (David Lynch might be the only director capable of that). He's a proficient director in every way, and seems to be blessed with a natural rapport with actors (perhaps why so many good ones want to work with him). Yet Gordon isn't a visionary director, and this was a visionary script. Fortunately, he had a visionary actor at a career peak to take up the slack, and Downey carries the day.The Singing Detective isn't a masterpiece; it's flawed and fractured and at times thin, even facile and occasionally redundant (most especially in the pseudo-noir sequences). But it's an imaginative and fearless piece of cinema, an admirably eccentric work that manages to do something like justice to a brilliant piece of writing. Full of inventive delights and heartfelt touches, it leaves most other recent American films in the dust.

It's fun to see well-known actors in the other parts, especially Adrien Brody, although Robin Wright Penn seems out of place - she's too spare and sharp to have the right noir look, especially in the sexier scenes.

798443,A2R3Y98D2DPDU7,B0001AW04I,John Lazar,"[4, 6]","In the world of writer Dennis Potter (PENNIES FROM HEAVEN, LIPSTICK ON YOUR COLLAR), upbeat songs are used to contrast the gloomy lives of Potter's downbeat characters. Keith Gordon's adaptation of Potter's THE SINGING DETECTIVE stands in the mighty shadow of the acclaimed 6-hour BBC television production (1986). I suppose Gordon's effort should be judged on its own merits, but since I saw the BBC miniseries first, it's impossible for me not to draw comparisons.Robert Downey Jr. plays a writer hospitalized for an extreme case of eczema, a skin disease that results in inflammation and scaliness (in real life, Potter suffered from the same disorder). During his stay, Downey, a miserable misogynist, frequently escapes into the fictional life of his alter ego, a singing detective. In these fantasies, he finds himself confronting many long-suppressed emotional issues.The BBC version had the luxury of exploring its protagonist over a six-hour duration, allowing lead actor Michael Gambon to infuse his character with the sort of subtle shadings that are nowhere to be found in this remake. With only 108 minutes to cover the same ground, Robert Downey Jr. turns in rushed, one-note performance, though probably not through any fault of his own. But he's still one cranky jerk and after a while, even the most indulgent viewer will lose interest in him, and begin wondering why they should care about any of his whining. Without the key ingredient of audience sympathy, Gordon's film implodes.In Gordon's defense, Dennis Potter's work is notoriously tricky to adapt; Potter's writings are populated by unappealing souls and his technique of allowing songs to convey a character's suppressed emotions is a conceptual conceit that can--and often does--grow tiresome. When it's done correctly, however, it makes for compelling, disturbing entertainment. For that reason, I advise you to skip this film, and check out the BBC version of THE SINGING DETECTIVE and the underrated Steve Martin film PENNIES FROM HEAVEN.",1,A big disappointment,1226361600,"11 11, 2008",2008,2019,"['world', 'writer', 'Dennis', 'Potter', 'PENNIES', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', 'LIPSTICK', 'ON', 'YOUR', 'COLLAR', 'upbeat', 'songs', 'are', 'used', 'contrast', 'gloomy', 'lives', 'Potter', 'downbeat', 'characters', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'adaptation', 'Potter', 'THE', 'SINGING', 'DETECTIVE', 'mighty', 'shadow', 'acclaimed', '6-hour', 'BBC', 'television', 'production', '1986', 'suppose', 'Gordon', 'effort', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'own', 'merits', 'saw', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'first', 'impossible', 'not', 'draw', 'comparisons.Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'writer', 'hospitalized', 'extreme', 'case', 'eczema', 'skin', 'disease', 'results', 'inflammation', 'scaliness', 'real', 'life', 'Potter', 'suffered', 'same', 'disorder', 'stay', 'Downey', 'miserable', 'misogynist', 'frequently', 'fictional', 'life', 'alter', 'ego', 'singing', 'detective', 'fantasies', 'confronting', 'many', 'long-suppressed', 'emotional', 'issues.The', 'BBC', 'version', 'had', 'luxury', 'exploring', 'protagonist', 'six-hour', 'duration', 'allowing', 'lead', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'infuse', 'character', 'sort', 'subtle', 'shadings', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'remake', 'only', '108', 'minutes', 'cover', 'same', 'ground', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'rushed', 'one-note', 'performance', 'though', 'probably', 'not', 'fault', 'own', 'still', 'one', 'cranky', 'jerk', 'while', 'even', 'most', 'indulgent', 'viewer', 'will', 'lose', 'interest', 'begin', 'wondering', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'whining', 'key', 'ingredient', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'Gordon', 'film', 'implodes.In', 'Gordon', 'defense', 'Dennis', 'Potter', 'work', 'notoriously', 'tricky', 'adapt', 'Potter', 'writings', 'are', 'populated', 'unappealing', 'souls', 'technique', 'allowing', 'songs', 'convey', 'character', 'suppressed', 'emotions', 'conceptual', 'conceit', 'can', 'often', 'grow', 'tiresome', 'When', 'done', 'correctly', 'however', 'compelling', 'disturbing', 'entertainment', 'reason', 'advise', 'skip', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'BBC', 'version', 'THE', 'SINGING', 'DETECTIVE', 'underrated', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'film', 'PENNIES', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN']",The Singing Detective

It was probably one of the top ten miniseries to ever show up on TV. So, when I heard that Robert Downey Jr. was doing a movie version I was excited.There's something wrong witht this movie and I can't quite put my finger on what it is.Robert Downey is a fine actor and does a good job with a tough role as  Dan Dark, a writer in the hospital suffering from a combination of arthritis and psoriasis gone beserk. He looks ghastly, feels ghastly and behaves viciously towards the hospital staff who force him to see a psychiatrist played astonishingly by Mel Gibson. Betweeen Mel's acting and makeup you'd never know it was him.Dan is in such pain that he's hallucinating and when he's not doing that he comforts himself by thinking about his first book, The Singing Detective. It's set in the 50s and all the songs Dan sings come from that era as well. As he get's better and reluctantly works with the doctor Dan is forced to relive the worst thing that ever happened to him.The movie largely stays faithful to the original material but somehow I didn't feel the same sympathy for Robert Downey's version of the character as I had for Michael Gambon. The father isn't as tragic and the mother didn't have the same impact. Robin Penn playing the ex wife was extremely unattractive. And the ending came just a litte to easy in this version and would tick off anyone who's been seriously ill either physically or mentally.This version of Singing Detective is like Brahms being played by a music box. It's music but it doesn't compare to Brahms being played by a great musician.

798446,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B0001AW04I,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[4, 4]","The Singing Detective is a frantic, high energy and very weird cinematic experience. Dennis Potter wrote the screenplay for the film in 1992, two years before his death, based on his own 1986 BBC miniseries of the same name. Potter, who suffered from the same skin disease as our main character, very much wanted a feature film version of his miniseries, which may or may not closely resemble his own life. The script kicked around Hollywood for nearly a decade before director Keith Gordon, star Robert Downey Jr., and producer Mel Gibson became attached. The result is a fine example of entertainment - an eclectic mix of drama, film noir, and comedy, with plenty of fantasy musical numbers thrown in for good measure.Robert Downey Jr. gives a truly amazing performance as Dan Dark, a pulp fiction author who is flat on his back in a hospital, suffering from a debilitating skin condition. If anything, his mind is in worse shape than his body. As he slowly recovers, he imagines scenes from his first novel, The Singing Detective, with himself as the lead character. His ex-wife, Nicola (a beautiful Robin Wright Penn), visits him at the hospital and plays a key part in his frantic imagination. He also has dreams and visions of his childhood, where he sees his mother (Carla Gugino) have an affair with his father's partner, Mark Binney (Jeremy Northam). His psychotherapist, Dr. Gibbon (an almost unrecognizable Mel Gibson), believes that things he experienced as a child have led to his sudden outbursts of violent temper. It is Gibbon's job to heal Dan's mind in tandem with his recovering body. Katie Holmes, as a nurse caring for Dan, Adrien Brody, and Jon Polito, as a pair of hoods, round out the excellent cast.The Singing Detective is definitely different from any film to come out in recent years. It has a bizarre David Lynch like quality and a refreshing weirdness. The script is jumbled and moves frantically from one thing to another, but its gorgeous style, energetic performances, and fantastic musical numbers keep it entertaining. I wish it were a bit longer so I could understand the story a little better, but seeing this has made me desperate to seek out the original miniseries, which I have yet to see. The pacing can sometimes become tedious, and the concept of the film can be challenging for those unfamiliar with the source material, but ultimately ""The Singing Detective"" is a visual delight and an acting tour-de-force. It is one of the most unique films I have seen in years and I'm sure glad I saw it.

This shorter version is a daring and mostly successful attempt by director Keith Gordon to fuse all the elements of the story into a madcap collection of tough reality and odd hallucinations. Dan Dark (Downey) is a bedridden author severely disabled by the worst case of psoriasis imaginable. He refuses any medication and thereby experiences hallucinations - or reality - or stories for his next book? Director Gordon teases us through out the movie. Downey is exceptional as the acid tongued, highly emotional, screaming patient who has a wisecrack quip for any lowly doctor or nurse that comes his way. He verbally abuses his wife who can barely keep up with attacks, but sometimes shines through when needed. There's a lot of paranoia in this story and the 40's film clips where Dan Dark is the detective investigating some murders is part tongue in cheek and part possible reality. The scenes are chunks of 40's detective clich&eacute;s thrown into a series of sentences. It's masterfully amusing. When Downey gets nearly unbearable to watch as the pain stricken patient, the film switches to a hallucinatory dance and signing number driven by Dan Dark's imagination. Sometimes it seems like a diversion and other times it's sheer brilliance. All the actors, Robin Wright Penn, Adrien Brody, Katie Holmes and Mel Gibson (as the nearly unrecognizable psychiatrist) do masterful jobs and Dennis Potter's dialogue is amazingly crisp.

All I heard was praises for him in this film, and I must say I was disappointed when this movie never came to theater when I first heard about it over a year ago. You would have thought with a movie with this kind of cast including Downey, Mel Gibson, Katie Holmes Wright Penn, and Adrien Brody would have made this movie shine. It's anything but that.Dan Darko(Downey) is an author. He's in a hospital for some kind of skin condition that they never explain how he got. He is stuck in the hospital and he hates every minute of it. He starts to hullicinate and live out the novels that he's written. He's not sure what is fake and whats not except for the visits from the few people he sees.Dr.Gibbons(Gibson) is the closest thing that Darko has to a friend. He really does want to help him out, and the two really do play some interesting mind games out with each other. Gibbons is trying to help him overcome his illusions and get himself back into the real world.The real world isn't what Darko likes. His nagging ex-wife(Wright Penn) is hanging around with ulterior motives. He does however enjoy his daily rubs with skin cream from Nurse Mills(Holmes).However it's up to Darko to overcome his problems. He's living out painful memories from his life and he must make the descion to solve the problems and get back to reality or stay in the dream world he hates.The worst part of this movie is the organization of it. It's really messy at times. You don't know what is going on and the jump to reality and fantasy is non stop. It's to much of an effort to try to keep up with it. It's not thats it to complicated but it's boring and stupid.I enjoyed parts of the script. I loved some of the conversations between Darko and Gibbons. Gibson and Downey are both great in those situations. The rest of the script is a waste.The acting isn't bad in the movie, but it's nothing to write home about. There is so much wasted talent in this picture. This movie is really a waste in something that could have been so much better.

798453,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0001AW04I,Robert Moore,"[26, 33]","The original BBC television series THE SINGING DETECTIVE, written by Dennis Potter, is by any standard one of the milestones of television.  It was a weird but spectacularly successful blend of hospital drama, film noir, psychological thriller, and surreal musical that managed to strike the right balance between its disparate elements to create something utterly unique and magical.  Michael Gambon was perfect in the lead, and he was complemented by a first rate cast, including Bill Patterson and Joanna Whalley.Now we have a very odd thing indeed:  a film version of a television series, complete with an all star cast of such performers as Robert Downey Jr., Mel Gibson (all but unrecognizable behind a balding head of light brown hair and thick glasses), Adrien Brody, Robin Penn Wright, Alfre Woodard, Carla Gugino (of SPY KIDS fame), Jon Polito, Katie Holmes, and Jeremy Northam.  Despite a spirited, capable performance by Downey (talent intact after his incarceration) in the main role (Dan Dark, as opposed to the Philip Marlowe of the television series), the film simply isn't very successful.  I had such high expectations for this one!So, why does this movie fail?  Primarily, two reasons.  First, the original series was 450 minutes long, while the movie is only 109.  In other words, the series had ample time to introduce the viewer to its strange, nightmarish, surreal world, while the movie, because of time limitations, simply plunges the viewer directly into the heart of things.  For anyone who has seen the series, it will seem as if the movie is constantly in a rush, and as if it is always leaving things out.  The movie comes across as far less varied and rich.The other problem is that for the most part the movie lacks the energy and vitality of the series, almost as if there is less of a sense of what it is that they are trying to achieve.  One watching the series will recognize that without the deft touch exerted by Potter on the script, the show could easily degenerate into something odd and unpleasant.  This is precisely what happens in the movie.One would imagine that with an all-star cast and a larger budget, the movie would at least be a far more attractive and visually compelling affair.  I actually prefered the hospital wards of the series.  The cast should have been an improvement, but I found nearly all the performers apart from Downey to be wasted in their roles.  About the only thing that I found better in the film was Downey's makeup.  The main character is suffering from an especially nasty case of psoriatic arthritis, and Downey does indeed look quite afflicted.  However, psoriatic arthritis is far more treatable today than it was during the time when the television series was set (one of my best friends suffers from it, and tells me about the medications that she uses in fighting the condition), so it didn't make as much medical sense now as it did almost twenty years ago.My greatest fear about this film is that it will skew people's assumptions about the original series.  It is truly an unworthy successor, and I would urge everyone to see the original series, which is available on DVD.  Those who like the movie will love the original even more, and even those who hate the movie will love it.",2,A pale imitation of the classic TV series,1066694400,"10 21, 2003",2003,3267,"['original', 'BBC', 'television', 'series', 'THE', 'SINGING', 'DETECTIVE', 'written', 'Dennis', 'Potter', 'standard', 'one', 'milestones', 'television', 'was', 'weird', 'spectacularly', 'successful', 'blend', 'hospital', 'drama', 'film', 'noir', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'surreal', 'musical', 'managed', 'strike', 'right', 'balance', 'disparate', 'elements', 'create', 'something', 'utterly', 'unique', 'magical', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'was', 'perfect', 'lead', 'was', 'complemented', 'first', 'rate', 'cast', 'including', 'Bill', 'Patterson', 'Joanna', 'Whalley.Now', 'have', 'very', 'odd', 'thing', 'indeed', 'film', 'version', 'television', 'series', 'complete', 'star', 'cast', 'such', 'performers', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'unrecognizable', 'balding', 'head', 'light', 'brown', 'hair', 'thick', 'glasses', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Robin', 'Penn', 'Wright', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'SPY', 'KIDS', 'fame', 'Jon', 'Polito', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'spirited', 'capable', 'performance', 'Downey', 'talent', 'intact', 'incarceration', 'main', 'role', 'Dan', 'Dark', 'opposed', 'Philip', 'Marlowe', 'television', 'series', 'film', 'simply', ""n't"", 'very', 'successful', 'had', 'such', 'high', 'expectations', 'one', 'So', 'why', 'movie', 'fail', 'Primarily', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'original', 'series', 'was', '450', 'minutes', 'long', 'movie', 'only', '109', 'other', 'words', 'series', 'had', 'ample', 'time', 'introduce', 'viewer', 'strange', 'nightmarish', 'surreal', 'world', 'movie', 'time', 'limitations', 'simply', 'viewer', 'directly', 'heart', 'things', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'series', 'will', 'seem', 'movie', 'constantly', 'rush', 'always', 'leaving', 'things', 'out', 'movie', 'across', 'far', 'less', 'varied', 'other', 'problem', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'energy', 'vitality', 'series', 'almost', 'less', 'sense', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'achieve', 'One', 'watching', 'series', 'will', 'recognize', 'deft', 'touch', 'exerted', 'Potter', 'script', 'show', 'could', 'easily', 'degenerate', 'something', 'odd', 'unpleasant', 'precisely', 'what', 'movie.One', 'would', 'imagine', 'all-star', 'cast', 'larger', 'budget', 'movie', 'would', 'least', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'attractive', 'visually', 'compelling', 'affair', 'actually', 'prefered', 'hospital', 'wards', 'series', 'cast', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'improvement', 'found', 'nearly', 'performers', 'apart', 'Downey', 'be', 'wasted', 'roles', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'better', 'film', 'was', 'Downey', 'makeup', 'main', 'character', 'suffering', 'especially', 'nasty', 'case', 'psoriatic', 'arthritis', 'Downey', 'indeed', 'look', 'quite', 'afflicted', 'However', 'psoriatic', 'arthritis', 'far', 'more', 'treatable', 'today', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'television', 'series', 'was', 'set', 'one', 'best', 'friends', 'suffers', 'tells', 'medications', 'fighting', 'condition', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'as', 'much', 'medical', 'sense', 'now', 'did', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago.My', 'greatest', 'fear', 'film', 'will', 'skew', 'people', 'assumptions', 'original', 'series', 'truly', 'unworthy', 'successor', 'would', 'urge', 'everyone', 'see', 'original', 'series', 'available', 'DVD', 'who', 'like', 'movie', 'will', 'love', 'original', 'even', 'more', 'even', 'who', 'hate', 'movie', 'will', 'love']",The Singing Detective
798454,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001AW04I,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 8]","When ""The Singing Detective"" was first produced as a TV mini series in 1986, it had a cumulative running time of well over 400 minutes.  In this theatrical remake, the story has been pared down to no more than 106.  I haven't seen the original - which enjoyed almost unprecedented critical acclaim in its time - so I have no idea how much of its quality has been lost  in its currently truncated form.  Hence, I will only be talking about this expurgated version, which stars Robert Downey Jr. and Mel Gibson, both in virtually unrecognizable roles.  It should be noted that the screenplay is credited to the late Dennis Potter, the author of the original work, so we can assume that director Keith Gordon simply cut and pasted - though a less charitable person might say ""bowdlerized"" - the much longer teleplay.""The Singing Detective"" tells the surrealistic tale of a writer of detective fictions who is suffering from a horrifically painful and disfiguring skin disease.  As he lies in his hospital bed, his mind drifts back and forth between reality and fantasy, a hallucinatory condition brought on by fever and his own author's imagination.  At times, Dan is  acutely aware of his miserable situation in the here and now, with all its attendant physical and psychological agony.  At other times he becomes lost in re-enactments of key scenes from his gumshoe fictions, memories of his miserable childhood, and elaborately staged song-and-dance numbers in which the characters lip-synch to musical standards from the `40`s and `50`s.Because its style and subject matter are somewhat off-putting at first, ""The Singing Detective"" takes a bit of getting used to, but eventually the themes and stylistic elements begin to come together and the film takes off.  The irony is that, for all the razzle dazzle of its form and style, the film is at its most intriguing in its quieter, subtler moments when the embittered hospital patient is forced to confront the demons of his own tormented psyche.  Dan Dark is a man who obviously prefers the world of fantasy to the cold harshness of an often excruciatingly painful reality.  In addition to his debilitating disease, Dan is also haunted by a failed marriage and an often tragic childhood that he tries to ""correct"" by entering the world of idealized fiction, one that he can manipulate and control.  As the bombastic hospital psychologist figures out, Dan's illness is essentially psychosomatic in nature, one rooted in his inability to accept the realities of life in his own skin.  In fact, Dan ultimately discovers that his disease is as much a product of his imagination as the scenarios and characters that make up his fiction.  The illness becomes his way of not having to deal with his inner torments.  Somewhat paradoxically, his writing becomes a form of therapy for him, helping him to deal with all that unresolved bitterness in his soul.  The film is as much about psychological healing as it is about physical healing.  Oddly enough, Dan's confrontations with his wife, psychologist and other hospital staff are actually far more interesting than what is happening in his rather puerile imagination.  Still, towards the end of the film, when Dan starts to make some profound psychological breakthroughs, the fantasy scenes actually do begin to work and the complex structure pays off.Downey does a fantastic job bringing Dan to life, conveying both the physical and emotional anguish the character is undergoing.  Gibson has a great deal of fun playing the part of a paunchy, balding psychiatrist whose unorthodox methods wind up getting to the root of his belligerent patient's troubles.  Robin Wright Penn, Jeremy Northam, Adrian Brody, Katie Homes and Alfre Woodard among others all deliver top notch supporting performances.  And special praise must surely go to the large makeup staff whose work here is nothing short of miraculous.""The Singing Detective"" will probably not satisfy diehard fans of the original lengthy mini series.

I think it would alter some of their judgements. As Gordon explains, the film script was in fact written by Dennis Potter, whose original ""Singing Detective"" ran as a much longer miniseries on British TV 20 years ago, and the changes to an American setting with 1950s American pop music were really Potter's own ideas. If the transition to feature film format loses something in the translation, it is in part due to his reconceptualization of his original creation.As the commentary reveals, much of the inventiveness in this new version is not apparent in a single viewing. While it may seem to truncate and over-simplify the lengthier TV version, there is still complexity and ambiguity enough to entertain and engage a thoughtful viewer appreciative of good screenwriting and wonderful performances. Robert Downey's dual role as the embittered writer and the Bogart-style detective of the title reveal the mercurial range of this amazing actor, and his scenes with Robin Wright Penn, who plays his wife, are a brilliant portrayal of two people equally matched in their struggle to preserve a relationship and, at the same time, the integrity of themselves as individuals.Strong cast. Interesting contrast of visual styles. Rated R for a wide range of disturbingly graphic and lurid visual imagery, including the main character's horrific skin condition.

I thought the original was one of the finest works ever to grace the TV.  However, the movie was a real disappointment.I knew going in that the story had been changed somewhat to a different time & place with different music.  But unfortunately, the differences between this movie and the mini-series were all for the worse.The story has been changed in some subtle and not-so-subtle ways.  One big difference is that the lead character is in a private hospital room, which takes away much of the give-and-take dialog and atmosphere of the original.  The original's use of sex scenes, while provocative for the TV, was quite mild compared to the much more flagrant incestuous and Oedipal scenes in the movie.  The movie is much more dark and unredeeming in general.  Finally, while I like R. Downey, he was a very poor substitute for Michael Gambon in this part.  He was really completely unbelievable as a frustrated author - not that a better acting job would have made this a decent movie - I got the sense he was reading his lines off a teleprompter.The cast in general looked good on paper, but again, they weren't enough to save this stinker.I don't know exactly why this version was so much worse than the original.  Whether the author's rewrite, the shorter format, the director, or Hollywood in general are to blame.

798457,A3KKPVZ2EQQLAB,B0001AW04I,The archduke,"[2, 6]","Because of the strong list of actors in this movie, ""The Singing Detective"" could have been an absolute gem, but it was simply bogged down by the writing. From start to finish this script seems confused, as though the writer was trying to cram way too many things into one simple film.This movie is about Dark, a novelist laid up in hospital with a severe skin condition. Here he hallucinates about being a private detective in the 30's or 40's, where the story is even more muddled by strange musical lip-synching that hardly advances the plot.The acting here is strong, as Robert Downey Jr. is in his usual fine form, going from a film noir detective to a bitter patient in the present day. Katie Holmes and Robin Wright Penn also deliver strong performances as a nurse and Dark's wife, respectively. The true achievement in this film is the performance of Mel Gibson, who plays an eccentric psychotherapist for Dark. He plays the doctor with an impressive quirkiness that I thought was not possible from the usually wooden Gibson.I think this movie could have really been great, and there are elements here that glimmer with hope, but it all falls flat because of the overbearing script. Had the writer been more focused, or sure of what he wanted to see up on the screen, then this movie would have been alot better than it was.",2,Confused and all over the place,1080604800,"03 30, 2004",2004,1332,"['strong', 'list', 'actors', 'movie', 'Singing', 'Detective', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'absolute', 'gem', 'was', 'simply', 'bogged', 'down', 'writing', 'start', 'finish', 'script', 'confused', 'writer', 'was', 'trying', 'cram', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'one', 'simple', 'film.This', 'movie', 'Dark', 'novelist', 'laid', 'up', 'hospital', 'severe', 'skin', 'condition', 'Here', 'being', 'private', 'detective', '30', '40', 'where', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'muddled', 'strange', 'musical', 'lip-synching', 'hardly', 'plot.The', 'acting', 'here', 'strong', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'usual', 'fine', 'form', 'going', 'film', 'noir', 'detective', 'bitter', 'patient', 'present', 'day', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'also', 'strong', 'performances', 'nurse', 'Dark', 'wife', 'respectively', 'true', 'achievement', 'film', 'performance', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'who', 'eccentric', 'psychotherapist', 'Dark', 'doctor', 'impressive', 'quirkiness', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'possible', 'usually', 'wooden', 'Gibson.I', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'great', 'are', 'elements', 'here', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'flat', 'overbearing', 'script', 'Had', 'writer', 'been', 'more', 'focused', 'sure', 'what', 'wanted', 'see', 'up', 'screen', 'then', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'alot', 'better', 'was']",The Singing Detective

He is hospitalized with a skin disorder which apparently is psychological. His shrink is played by Mel Gibson, in an unorthodox role for him. Dark's novel is based on events in his childhood, making characters from people he had met. Danny is delusional and imagines things in the present, confounding the people in real life with the characters in his book. The dialogue in the movie is excellent. If you enjoyed the dark humor of the Joker in the Dark Knight, you will enjoy the ramblings of Downey early on.

798460,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001AW04I,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","So many reviewers so far point out that 'The Singing Detective' is inferior to the 1986 TV mini-series starring Michael Gambon.  On the other hand, there are some who defend this newer Robert Downey Jr. version on the ground that it has its own charms, mostly about its quirky nature.  I happened to be interested in the film after seeing the cast without knowing the background history of the film including all about Dennis Potter.  Now I've seen it, and I was intrigued with the unique world at first, but sorry, that didn't last very long.Actually, I'm impressed with certain things.  No matter what people say, Robert Downey Jr. is a fantastic actor, and he shows it as Dan Dark in a hospital bed.  His pains hiding behind his arrogance can be easily felt thanks to his powerful acting and good make-up jobs.  I have nothing against the other cast which is also impressive -- from reliable Robin Wright Penn to Mel Gibson with a bald wig on his head.  Even Katie Holmes is good, but perhaps the truth is, she can be good if she wants to.But even if you have not seen the original TV like me, you would soon realize the defects of the film.  Im short it needs more time.  So many characters are made to appear in Dark's two worlds, reality and fantasy, that they are all reduced to insignificant cyphers.  Alfre Woodard appears fleetingly, and is gone.  Adrian Brody and Jon Polito appear as Hoods, and ... what did they do?  Nothing that I can remember.  Jeremy Northam?  Where is he?But more fundamental trouble is the relation between Dark and the doctor played by Gibson.  For all Gibson's good acting as oddball Dr. Gibbon, Dark's psychological process to find the true problem about his over-aggressive mind through his ficional noir world looks too contrived here, and is given too short time to convince us.  Even the musical sections, though themselves good, look mercilessly cut short.  Director Keith Gordon does his best, but if you see too short musical parts (Danny and the Juniors' hit 'At the Hop' for example) it is obvious that the film's budget was limited.I'm not telling you 'The Singing Detective' is a bad film.  Rather, it is an example showing that with a wiser decision of the filmmakers, this could have been much better.  Why not longer version instead of just 110 minutes?  But perhaps, like Billy Bob Thornton's 'All the Pretty Horses,' the exectives would not allow that.",2,"Some Nice Visuals, But Too Short Time for More Imagination",1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,2406,"['So', 'many', 'reviewers', 'so', 'far', 'point', 'out', 'Singing', 'Detective', 'inferior', '1986', 'TV', 'mini-series', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'who', 'defend', 'newer', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'version', 'ground', 'own', 'charms', 'mostly', 'quirky', 'nature', 'happened', 'be', 'interested', 'film', 'seeing', 'cast', 'knowing', 'background', 'history', 'film', 'including', 'Dennis', 'Potter', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'intrigued', 'unique', 'world', 'first', 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long.Actually', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'certain', 'things', 'matter', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'Dan', 'Dark', 'hospital', 'bed', 'pains', 'hiding', 'arrogance', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'felt', 'thanks', 'powerful', 'acting', 'good', 'make-up', 'jobs', 'have', 'nothing', 'other', 'cast', 'also', 'impressive', 'reliable', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'bald', 'wig', 'head', 'Even', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'good', 'perhaps', 'truth', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'to.But', 'even', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'TV', 'would', 'soon', 'realize', 'defects', 'film', 'Im', 'short', 'more', 'time', 'So', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'made', 'appear', 'Dark', 'two', 'worlds', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'are', 'reduced', 'insignificant', 'cyphers', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'fleetingly', 'gone', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'Jon', 'Polito', 'appear', 'Hoods', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'Nothing', 'can', 'remember', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Where', 'more', 'fundamental', 'trouble', 'relation', 'Dark', 'doctor', 'played', 'Gibson', 'Gibson', 'good', 'acting', 'oddball', 'Dr.', 'Gibbon', 'Dark', 'psychological', 'process', 'find', 'true', 'problem', 'over-aggressive', 'mind', 'ficional', 'noir', 'world', 'too', 'contrived', 'here', 'given', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'convince', 'Even', 'musical', 'sections', 'good', 'look', 'mercilessly', 'cut', 'short', 'Director', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'best', 'see', 'too', 'short', 'musical', 'parts', 'Danny', 'Juniors', 'hit', 'Hop', 'example', 'obvious', 'film', 'budget', 'was', 'limited.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'telling', ""'The"", 'Singing', 'Detective', 'bad', 'film', 'Rather', 'example', 'showing', 'wiser', 'decision', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Why', 'not', 'longer', 'version', 'instead', 'just', '110', 'minutes', 'perhaps', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Pretty', 'Horses', 'exectives', 'would', 'not', 'allow']",The Singing Detective
798461,A3I92PEEL1B62O,B0001AW04I,"wysewomon ""wysewomon""","[3, 5]","Dan Dark, writer of noir, Raymond Chandler-esque Detective fiction is suffering from a severe skin condition that has made him virtually a prisoner in his own body.  Mentally, he dwells in the realm of his novel, The Singing Detective, where he is a suave, hard-boiled yet sensitive PI.  When forced to interact with the real world, Dark is obnoxious, angry and abusive.  When his condition fails to improve, his doctor prescribes psychotherapy.  Using his book as a key to his past, his therapist hopes to unlock Dark's subconcious and set him on the road to healing.There were several good things about this movie.  The concept had a great deal of potential to be depthful and interesting.  The film-making was pretty interesting.  The performances were remarkable and Mel Gibson's make-up job was astounding.  But the movie as a whole didn't work for me because the overall story lacked a coherent dynamic structure.  The pieces worked, but they didn't fit together and I felt that some of them were missing.  I don't mind having to fill in a few blanks in a movie, but in _The Singing Detective_ I had the constant and unpleasant feeling that I wasn't quite sure what was going on.The movie moves through three storylines:  the real world of Dan Dark in the hospital, the fantasy world of Dan Dark, The Singing Detective, and the memory world of Dark's childhood.  I didn't think the Detective world was given enough attention.  The story that was happening there was not entirely clear and there was little internal logic.  This frustrated me because it seemed to me that the detective world was supposed to be the place where the other two worlds met.  But since it had no solidity, it was only a tenuous bridge and the viewer was left to make up a lot.  I would have liked it better if the filmmaker had chosen to spend more time with the detective world and less time in the hospital.  Also, far too much time and detail was spent in Dark's memories.  By the time we got to the big revelation scene, it was redundant because we already knew what Dark was going to say.  There was no sense of climax, and the closure seemed contrived.The murky story was muddied even further by a subplot that seemed to deal with Dark's paranoia about his present day life.  I think this could have been left out. Often there was no clear distinction made between what was really happening in the present-day world and what wasn't.  All in all, the film had such a surreal feel that, not only was it difficult to tell what was going on, it was difficult to care.Watching _The Singing Detective_ was like putting together a jigsaw puzzle with pieces that have intersting shapes but, when joined, give a picture of a Rorshach ink blot.  What the viewer gets out of it is probably his own business.
