197804,A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ,630016439X,Andrew Parodi,"[18, 23]","Maya Angelou is one of my favorite authors (see my Maya Angelou ""buyer's guide""), so I was really excited when I got my hands on a copy of this made-for-TV movie which is based on her autobiography of the same title. After watching it for about an hour, I had to turn it off. It is far too slow and - I hate to use the word but here I go - boring. Most of the actors don't really seem to fill their roles really well, with Esther Rolle being the exception. She really comes through in this movie and was perhaps the only thing that kept me interested (though she couldn't save the movie).Joseph Campbell was quoted as saying that, ultimately, all stories have been told. Most stories are based on the journey of the hero. This is certainly the case with Maya Angelou's life as depicted in I KNOW WHY THE CAGED BIRD SINGS. Campbell indicated that what makes a story worthwhile is the orinigality of the way it is told. And that is the problem with a TV movie based on Angelou's book: it doesn't have Angelou to tell it. In other words, I believe that Maya Angelou as a story teller and personality is just as interesting as the story she tells. A movie version of her life cannot be told by her but must be told by screenwriters, directors, actors, etc., and therefore suffers.",3,"Too slow and, well, boring",1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,1276,"['Maya', 'Angelou', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'see', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'buyer', 'guide', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'when', 'got', 'hands', 'copy', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'based', 'autobiography', 'same', 'title', 'watching', 'hour', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'far', 'too', 'slow', 'hate', 'use', 'word', 'here', 'go', 'boring', 'Most', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'fill', 'roles', 'really', 'well', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'being', 'exception', 'really', 'through', 'movie', 'was', 'perhaps', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'interested', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'movie', '.Joseph', 'Campbell', 'was', 'quoted', 'saying', 'ultimately', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'Most', 'stories', 'are', 'based', 'journey', 'hero', 'certainly', 'case', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'life', 'depicted', 'KNOW', 'THE', 'CAGED', 'BIRD', 'SINGS', 'Campbell', 'indicated', 'what', 'story', 'worthwhile', 'orinigality', 'way', 'told', 'problem', 'TV', 'movie', 'based', 'Angelou', 'book', ""n't"", 'have', 'Angelou', 'tell', 'other', 'words', 'believe', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'story', 'teller', 'personality', 'just', 'as', 'interesting', 'story', 'movie', 'version', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'must', 'be', 'told', 'screenwriters', 'directors', 'actors', 'etc.', 'therefore', 'suffers']",I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings VHS

197806,A2W30R08QPWM4M,630016439X,"Minnesota Raven ""Viking Vixen""","[24, 25]","I read this book when I was in high school ages ago and thank goodness I did.  It was one of those tidbits that helps to shape who you are and what you think of yourself.  I was and still am an avid reader but this book was the first book I read told from a young black girl's perspective.  Imagine it....  It blew me away.  But as I read this book it made me realize even more so that people are people.  While your environment certainly dictates what sort of priorities you have when you are young you basically think the same things.  I don't think the times have changed so much that this book wouldn't still be relevant to the youth of today.  For young girls (especially black girls) it deals with self esteem and those raging hormones (commonly referred to as &quot;I'm in Love&quot;), and for youth of any sex or color it deals with just growing up.If you have anyone in your life that is young, impressionable and going through their teens this book should be required reading.  They may not want to do it but I don't think they will be sorry they did do it.  You might want to read it or reread it if it's been awhile and then actually take some time to discuss it with a young person.  Maya's style is easy to read and to absorb and still stands the test of time.",5,Imparts something to all who read it.,1010880000,"01 13, 2002",2002,1274,"['read', 'book', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'ages', 'ago', 'thank', 'goodness', 'did', 'was', 'one', 'tidbits', 'shape', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'still', 'am', 'avid', 'reader', 'book', 'was', 'first', 'book', 'read', 'told', 'young', 'black', 'girl', 'perspective', 'Imagine', 'blew', 'away', 'read', 'book', 'made', 'realize', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'people', 'are', 'people', 'environment', 'certainly', 'what', 'sort', 'priorities', 'have', 'when', 'are', 'young', 'basically', 'think', 'same', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'book', 'would', ""n't"", 'still', 'be', 'relevant', 'youth', 'today', 'young', 'girls', 'especially', 'black', 'girls', 'self', 'esteem', 'raging', 'hormones', 'commonly', 'referred', ""'m"", 'Love', 'quot', 'youth', 'sex', 'color', 'just', 'growing', 'up.If', 'have', 'anyone', 'life', 'young', 'impressionable', 'going', 'teens', 'book', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'reading', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'sorry', 'did', 'do', 'might', 'want', 'read', 'reread', 'been', 'awhile', 'then', 'actually', 'take', 'time', 'discuss', 'young', 'person', 'Maya', 'style', 'easy', 'read', 'absorb', 'still', 'test', 'time']",I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings VHS
