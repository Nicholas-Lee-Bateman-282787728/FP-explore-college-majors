Scott Pilgrim is a fresh and preposterous journey back to the days of youth you may not want to remember.  Edgar Wright goes all the way with this comic adaptation and pulls no punches.  It veers from the elaborate, if overlong, action sequences to good old fashioned one-liners...""HE PUNCHED THE HIGHLIGHTS OUT OF HER HAIR!!!""Scott Pilgrim vs The World has the same pulse as Tom Tekwer's ""Lola Rent"" paired with visuals right out of Cowboy Bebop.  The only gripe I had was Michael Cera is getting a bit long in the tooth for these aloof post teen deadpan parts.  He's alright, but I really anted to see somebody new.

Throughout the film all of us were laughing and really into it. I think this movie best appeals to people in my age group, partly because of all the references to video games and for some reason it just felt like ""our"" kind of humor.

1348527,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B003L20IE2,amerdale876,"[68, 95]","The weekend of August 13, 2010, saw three major studio releases for each target audience:The Expendables [Blu-ray] for males,Eat Pray Love [Blu-ray] for females, and ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" for kids, teens and young adults. Being a recent fan of theScott Pilgrim's Precious Little Boxsetseries of graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, I was looking forward to the film adaptation - especially after hearing of the casting (most notably, Michael Cera) and the director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead [Blu-ray],Hot Fuzz (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]). I'm not the biggest fan of Wright's work; while I thought they were slightly funny films, I don't fall into the large masses who say they're the most hilarious contemporary films. Still, I like Wright's filmmaking style and I knew he'd do a great job with the material.There are quite a few people who believe Michael Cera acts the same in every movie and TV show he is in. And, depending on the actor, that can either be OK or extremely annoying. Cera does generally have the same acting methods, but, to me, it works for him. He has mastered the act of shy-but-hilarious, slightly neurotic geek, and I never tire of - or fail to laugh at - any role he portrays. And I'm a firm believer in that saying: if it ain't broke, don't fix it! The bottom line is: if you despise Cera then don't see this film as you'll probably only be rolling your eyes through most of it since it's his movie, and this film deserves more than that.I know people may laugh at the thought of a bestselling memoir geared towards women (""Eat Pray Love"") being compared to a bestselling graphic novel geared towards male adolescents. But, trust me, their meanings are similar. As I stated in my review for ""Eat Pray Love,"" it's a story about a writer taking a quest in Italy, India and Bali to forget her problems, start anew, and experience flavor and deep contemplation only to realize that you can't run from who you are; you have to be comfortable with who you are and make peace with what's happened in your life ... the good and the bad ... whether it was your doing or someone else's. It's no big surprise spoiler that Julia Roberts' Gilbert finds love and self-respect for herself and, at the same time, makes peace with the hurtful choices she's made. Now onto Cera's Scott Pilgrim. Although it's more prevalent in the books, the viewer can also tell in the film that Pilgrim is not only a slacker financially, but also in self-respect and accountability. He's made bad, selfish choices in love and he takes the universal young generation response whenever it comes to any sort of confrontation: ""whatever."" Nevertheless, I found his character much more likeable than Roberts' Gilbert.The film, ""Scott Pilgrim"" is told in a visual way that has the style format of a video game and comic book with the main character - finding himself having to fight - oops! - I mean, defeat the seven evil ex-boyfriends of his newest love interest, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). It's all metaphor for the baggage we carry when dating someone. Not only does one deal with the issues of our significant other's romantic past (how it affects them emotionally), but you also deal with your own insecurities and vulnerability when entering into a relationship and - unless your beloved has lived in a cave and had no prior romantic relationships - how your spouse's past suitors measure up to you. It's a silly, self-destructive game we play in our love lives, but everyone does it ... especially more frequently when we're younger.SPOILER ALERT!It's only when Pilgrim confronts his unresolved issues and finds self-respect that he truly wins ""the game."" And the girl. We see the transformation of a somewhat judgmental guy turn into a man who can love someone for who they truly are, including their flaws.SPOILER ENDS!As I said, the film, like its literary original, utilizes the comic panel sound effects of BAM, WHOOSH, etc., and cool, quirky characters, as well as the video game staples of coin dispersal after defeating an opponent, earning an extra life and special weapons, the countdown to continue a game, and the versus fight mode including fight combos and booming voice-over narration of ""K.O.!"" It's a unique, fresh style that I'm surprised hasn't been attempted before. Don't mistake me for some diehard gamer; even though I owned an original Xbox, I haven't been heavily involved with video games since the original Nintendo. Regardless, I loved the style Wright brought to the screen thanks to creator O'Malley. Second to Robert Rodriguez's film adaptation of Frank Miller'sFrank Miller's Complete Sin City Library(Sin City (Two-Disc Theatrical & Recut, Extended, and Unrated Versions) [Blu-ray]), this is the closest the viewer will get to a comic book come to life! And while that sounds spectacular to some; there will be others that find the movie just plain weird. It is weird. But it's a weird that's kind of great. It has wonderful meaning and great depth underneath the generation-X trappings of vegans, garage bands, cheat codes, straight edge, and ""whatever.""I was surprised to love the book as much I do because it's made up of what I mostly dislike with comics: it resembles a manga (I despise those!), it's black-and-white, and the art is more cartoonish rather than realistic (although, it does grow on you). Since I do love it, though, it's no surprise I enjoyed the film. It was wonderful seeing all the dialogue and one-liners from the books actually being said out loud, facial expressions and all. Cera, Winstead, and Kieran Culkin stand out in the film, while the evil exes each do good at providing humor while simultaneously presenting to Scott with a different issue or concern regarding his blossoming relationship with Ramona; but Scott's not the only one who has to confront issues, Ramona also finds herself having to face Scott's baggage. Thesoundtrackand score are impressive and I like them but I can see how it's not as appealable to a wide audience as the(500) Days Of Summer-Music From The Motion Picture(the best track on Pilgrim's soundtrack is Metric's ""Black Sheep,"" which is used as a song sung by The Clash at Demonhead). The songs all work splendidly in the film - i.e., when Ramona drives off with evil ex Gideon, the Rolling Stones' ""Under My Thumb"" is appropriately being played on the car stereo (check out the lyrics to know just how appropriate it is). Lastly, for a story that took six books to tell, it's expected that not everything from those books will be included in the film. In most films adapted from books, it seems most screenwriters leave out the best parts and add in the most lame. Don't fret, though. Screenwriters Wright and Michael Bacall kept in all of the cool lines and important scenes central to the story of Scott and Ramona; some lines are mixed with different scenes compared to the books, but it all still works out really well and, overall, stays true to the books (i.e., in the books, Ramona fights Scott's ex, Envy, but in the film, Ramona fights one of her evil exes, Roxy). Some funny parts fall flat but it's few and far between.""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is a fun, weird, fresh, innovative movie that's destined for cult status. Take that as you want, but, to this critic, I thoroughly enjoyed it!",5,K.O.!!!!!!!!,1285891200,"10 1, 2010",2010,7326,"['weekend', 'August', '13', '2010', 'saw', 'three', 'major', 'studio',

It just oozes with this quality that makes it so endearing, so versatile, so original; so memorable.I can't stop thinking about it.The film revolves around Scott, a nerdy twenty-two year old who has been wronged by the one girl he loved and so he kind of meanders through ridiculous relationships while holing up with his gay sidekick, Wallace.  Currently dating a high-school girl named Knives (she's Asian), Scott finds all his senses blown by the presence of Ramona Flowers.  She's totally out of his league, but he has to have her.  When she shows an odd interest in him, he gets a ridiculous email about fighting some band of exes to the death but takes none of it seriously until one of them shows up at the Battle of the Bands that his band is currently sparring off within and Scott soon starts kicking some serious butt.All in the name of love; right?Yes, the film has some issues (namely the ending, which lasts forever) but it is all forgivable thanks to the films brilliant construction.  Edited to the max and detailed marvelously, `Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is lush and exciting, with a `no holds bar' type of feel that just generates so much anticipation in the audience.  The film is just so engaging; so...fun.Michael Cera likes to play the same character a lot, but he's really good at it.  I want to see him stretch his humor, but he has a great resume of films that benefit from his signature delivery, so why mess with a good thing; right?  He creates a character he will be remembered for in Scott.  The rest of the cast is also on top of their game, whether they are reduced to a cameo that they totally milk (like Chris Evans) or they have the best role in the film and totally nail it (Kieran Culkin, who should have generated some serious awards buzz).The big star here is Edgar Wright, who stylishly decorates this film in a way that draws you in with every frame.  Perfectly draping the set with sound and visuals worthy of our time, Wright created a real `feeling' with this film.  It is a piece of art; definitely not your average `teen flick'.Sure, the poignancy of the whole thing can be debatable, but when all is said and done, `Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' was a ravishing breathe of fresh air; a way to take a tired subject and make it feel new again.Honestly, one of the best of the year!",5,Hit `em high...,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,2462,"['Certain', 'films', 'just', 'have', 'special', 'something', 'well', 'special', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'vs', 'World', 'one', 'films', 'just', 'quality', 'so', 'endearing', 'so', 'versatile', 'original', 'so', 'memorable.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'it.The', 'film', 'Scott', 'nerdy', 'twenty-two', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'been', 'wronged', 'one', 'girl', 'loved', 'so', 'kind', 'meanders', 'ridiculous', 'relationships', 'holing', 'up', 'gay', 'sidekick', 'Wallace', 'Currently', 'dating', 'high-school', 'girl', 'named', 'Knives', 'Asian', 'Scott', 'senses', 'blown', 'presence', 'Ramona', 'Flowers', 'totally', 'league', 'have', 'When', 'odd', 'interest', 'ridiculous', 'email', 'fighting', 'band', 'exes', 'death', 'none', 'seriously', 'one', 'up', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'band', 'currently', 'sparring', 'off', 'Scott', 'soon', 'kicking', 'serious', 'butt.All', 'name', 'love', 'right', 'Yes', 'film', 'issues', 'namely', 'ending', 'forever', 'forgivable', 'thanks', 'films', 'brilliant', 'construction', 'Edited', 'max', 'detailed', 'marvelously', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'vs', 'World', 'lush', 'exciting', 'no', 'bar', 'type', 'feel', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'anticipation', 'audience', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'engaging', 'so', 'fun.Michael', 'Cera', 'play', 'same', 'character', 'lot', 'really', 'good', 'want', 'see', 'stretch', 'humor', 'great', 'resume', 'films', 'benefit', 'signature', 'delivery', 'so', 'why', 'mess', 'good', 'thing', 'right', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'Scott', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'top', 'game', 'are', 'reduced', 'cameo', 'totally', 'milk', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'have', 'best', 'role', 'film', 'totally', 'nail', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'generated', 'serious', 'awards', 'buzz', 'big', 'star', 'here', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'who', 'stylishly', 'film', 'way', 'frame', 'Perfectly', 'draping', 'set', 'sound', 'visuals', 'worthy', 'time', 'Wright', 'created', 'real', 'feeling', 'film', 'piece', 'art', 'definitely', 'not', 'average', 'teen', ""flick'.Sure"", 'poignancy', 'whole', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'debatable', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'vs', 'World', ""'"", 'was', 'ravishing', 'breathe', 'fresh', 'air', 'way', 'take', 'tired', 'subject', 'make', 'feel', 'new', 'again.Honestly', 'one', 'best', 'year']",N/A

I was aware of the comics, and once I learned that it was a kind of celebration of video games, those expectations went even higher.Then I finally saw the movie, and I'm not sure what to think anymore.I guess I was expecting it to be more...video game-based. Maybe it was an unfair assumption, but I was surprised how very little the story or anything had to do with gaming, aside from the very loose, very indirect references that were pretty much interchangeable. But let me start over.SCOTT PILGRIM is about a young Canadian in his early twenties and this love triangle he randomly and shamelessly sparks. He's the bassist of a band that has yet to make it big, and is thusly relegated to playing small gigs and sharing a very small apartment with his gay best friend (I know he's gay because the film repeatedly goes out of its way to remind you, as if we wouldn't have figured it out otherwise). Despite the fact that Scott has a girl who is pretty much his counterpart, he begins cheating on her for another girl, Ramona Flowers, who he has no reason to like outside of her very loud hair.Unfortunately for Scott, Ramona's exes have formed a League of Evil Exes that will stop at nothing to ensure Ramona will never have another boyfriend. The rest of the movie shows Scott attempting to date two girls at once, all the while fighting these Evil Exes to the ""death.""The story is not the star of this film. Without the seriously-amazing visuals, it would never be able to stand on its own. Scott, to me, is one of the most unlikeable protagonists I've ever come across. It seems his likability is directly proportional to how much you approve of his juggling two relationships at the same time. I didn't care for this, so there was really no reason for me to care whether or not Scott would even win these fights he got into. That, to me, was a disappointing bust.Fortunately, the characters were interesting enough to carry me through it. Scott Pilgrim's gay friend, Wallace (he's gay, by the way), pretty much steals the show. He's hilarious, well-acted, and was definitely more interesting than the rest of the cast. Ramona Flowers is fairly interesting, as well. Her character seems, against all odds, believable, as was the emotional development she goes through. Kim, the band's red-headed drummer, was also very funny throughout.But, in all honesty, this movie will probably be remembered for the style in which it was filmed, and I have a bone to pick with it in that regard. The video game references. They are laced throughout this movie, and it was one of the main reasons I was interested in watching it. But, in my opinion, they really served no purpose. Throughout the entire movie, two video games are played, and one doesn't even exist. A couple games are briefly mentioned, but it only amounts to name-dropping.Despite the fact that you'll hear the opening jingle to ZELDA: A LINK TO THE PAST at the start, several sound bites from SONIC and STREET FIGHTER, people burst into coins like in RIVER CITY RANSOM, and that the final battle takes place in the ""Chaos Theater,"" which fans of EARTHBOUND will recognize, there's nothing about the plot that constitutes all of these indirect references. If the movie had showed one of the characters actually playing FINAL FANTASY II, it would have made all the difference. Gamers living in a game world. But there's very little about them that makes me think, ""Now there's a gamer. There's a guy who got the Biggoron Sword in OCARINA, and knows where all the secret Warp Pipes are in SUPER MARIO BROS. 3.""All of the references are just interchangeable. In fact, I would wager you could remove all of them and it would make very little difference. That's what was really disappointing to me, and the laughs will really, really depend on whether or not you're able to buy into it all.In the end, the movie was enjoyable, and probably more disappointing to me than it should have been, given the high bar I'd set for it. Fans of Edgar Wright will probably find something to like about this, as will fans of stylistic/cartoonish action films likeKung Fu Hustle. The choreography was awesome, the action was satisfying, but as for the gaming element, I don't think the film could have missed the mark any more than it did.",3,A video game movie about musicians,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,4482,"['had', 'exceptionally', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie.Shaun', 'DeadandHot', 'Fuzzare', 'two', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'would', 'knock', 'park', 'one', 'was', 'aware', 'comics', 'once', 'learned', 'was', 'kind', 'celebration', 'video', 'games', 'expectations', 'went', 'even', 'higher.Then', 'finally', 'saw', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'guess', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'more', 'video', 'game-based', 'Maybe', 'was', 'unfair', 'assumption', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'very', 'little', 'story', 'anything', 'had', 'do', 'gaming', 'aside', 'very', 'loose', 'very', 'indirect', 'references', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'interchangeable', 'let', 'start', 'over.SCOTT', 'PILGRIM', 'young', 'Canadian', 'early', 'twenties', 'love', 'triangle', 'randomly', 'shamelessly', 'sparks', 'bassist', 'band', 'yet', 'make', 'big', 'thusly', 'relegated', 'playing', 'small', 'gigs', 'sharing', 'very', 'small', 'apartment', 'gay', 'best', 'friend', 'know', 'gay', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'way', 'remind', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'figured', 'otherwise', 'fact', 'Scott', 'girl', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'counterpart', 'cheating', 'girl', 'Ramona', 'Flowers', 'who', 'reason', 'like', 'outside', 'very', 'loud', 'hair.Unfortunately', 'Scott', 'Ramona', 'exes', 'have', 'formed', 'League', 'Evil', 'Exes', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'ensure', 'Ramona', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'boyfriend', 'rest', 'movie', 'Scott', 'attempting', 'date', 'two', 'girls', 'once', 'while', 'fighting', 'Evil', 'Exes', 'death', 'story', 'not', 'star', 'film', 'seriously-amazing', 'visuals', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'Scott', 'one', 'most', 'unlikeable', 'protagonists', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'come', 'likability', 'directly', 'proportional', 'how', 'much', 'approve', 'juggling', 'two', 'relationships', 'same', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'really', 'reason', 'care', 'not', 'Scott', 'would', 'even', 'win', 'fights', 'got', 'was', 'disappointing', 'bust.Fortunately', 'characters', 'were', 'interesting', 'enough', 'carry', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'gay', 'friend', 'Wallace', 'gay', 'way', 'pretty', 'much', 'steals', 'show', 'hilarious', 'well-acted', 'was', 'definitely', 'more', 'interesting', 'rest', 'cast', 'Ramona', 'Flowers', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'odds', 'believable', 'was', 'emotional', 'development', 'Kim', 'band', 'red-headed', 'drummer', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'throughout.But', 'honesty', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'remembered', 'style', 'was', 'filmed', 'have', 'bone', 'pick', 'regard', 'video', 'game', 'references', 'are', 'laced', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'was', 'interested', 'watching', 'opinion', 'really', 'served', 'purpose', 'entire', 'movie', 'two', 'video', 'games', 'are', 'played', 'one', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'couple', 'games', 'are', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'only', 'name-dropping.Despite', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'opening', 'jingle', 'ZELDA', 'LINK', 'TO', 'THE', 'PAST', 'start', 'several', 'sound', 'bites', 'SONIC', 'STREET', 'FIGHTER', 'people', 'burst', 'coins', 'RIVER', 'CITY', 'RANSOM', 'final', 'battle', 'place', 'Chaos', 'Theater', 'fans', 'EARTHBOUND', 'will', 'recognize', 'nothing', 'plot', 'indirect', 'references', 'movie', 'had', 'showed', 'one', 'characters', 'actually', 'playing', 'FINAL', 'FANTASY', 'II', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'Gamers', 'living', 'game', 'world', 'very', 'little', 'think', 'Now', 'gamer', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'Biggoron', 'Sword', 'OCARINA', 'where', 'secret', 'Warp', 'Pipes', 'are', 'SUPER', 'MARIO', 'BROS', '3', 'references', 'are', 'just', 'interchangeable', 'fact', 'would', 'wager', 'could', 'remove', 'would', 'make', 'very', 'little', 'difference', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'disappointing', 'laughs', 'will', 'really', 'really', 'depend', 'not', ""'re"", 'able', 'buy', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'probably', 'more', 'disappointing', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'high', 'bar', ""'d"", 'set', 'Fans', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'will', 'fans', 'stylistic/cartoonish', 'action', 'films', 'likeKung', 'Fu', 'Hustle', 'choreography', 'was', 'awesome', 'action', 'was', 'satisfying', 'gaming', 'element', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'missed', 'mark', 'more', 'did']",N/A
1348533,A1Y07DRNJ1DKNK,B003L20IE2,Anon,"[7, 56]","I agree with reviewer K. Murphy who said: ""This movie, for all it's attempts to be trendy, flashy, fresh and fun, was a disappointment because of Micheal Cera and his uninspired and unlikeable character of Scott Pilgrim.""  Reviewer Maskedgamer said: ""Scott Pilgrim is such a dorky guy how is he getting these girls anyway? They all seem out of his league and he seems like the type that would be lead around by a leash and get walked on.""  I agreed with that too, and wished that the Pilgrim character would mature, develop into something interesting, and not just act strong, but become strong. The character remained essentially the same throughout. Like another reviewer, I fell asleep because the movie was so boring.  In my case, the special effects and martial arts seemed cliche and repetitive after a while.It was difficult for me to identify with a whiny, lazy adult main character who leeches off his friends, makes no attempt to get a job (and bails often on his band practice), dates a minor (the under-aged Knives Chau, called Chinese though she is apparently Canadian in the film as much as Pilgrim's character is -- he is never reduced to the ""white guy"" or ""Euro-looking"" guy), and cheats on, dumps  his faithful under-aged girlfriend for a woman with commitment issues. I find it sad and wrong to watch adult men date under-aged girls. Plus, I was disappointed that all the one dimensional Asian American characters were either killed, or in the case of Knives Chau, punched in the face. I expected a more entertaining film from Shawn of the Dead director Edgar Wright.  I agree with another reviewer who said something to the effect that he thought the plot was for a 5 minute film stretched to feature length.The original Matrix executed and developed the comic book style much better in the late 90s. I wanted to like the film and the protagonist based on the positive reviews. However, Eternal Sunshine was a better executed modern romance with more developed characters and plot, and in terms of the genre inspired by comic books, I enjoyed Spiderman and Batman (by C. Nolan) as better options.",1,Scott Pilgrim film celebrates mediocrity,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,2116,"['agree', 'reviewer', 'K.', 'Murphy', 'who', 'said', 'movie', 'attempts', 'be', 'trendy', 'flashy', 'fresh', 'fun', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Micheal', 'Cera', 'uninspired', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'Reviewer', 'Maskedgamer', 'said', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'such', 'dorky', 'guy', 'how', 'getting', 'girls', 'anyway', 'seem', 'league', 'type', 'would', 'be', 'lead', 'leash', 'get', 'walked', 'agreed', 'too', 'wished', 'Pilgrim', 'character', 'would', 'mature', 'develop', 'something', 'interesting', 'not', 'just', 'act', 'strong', 'become', 'strong', 'character', 'remained', 'essentially', 'same', 'reviewer', 'fell', 'asleep', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'case', 'special', 'effects', 'martial', 'arts', 'seemed', 'cliche', 'repetitive', 'while.It', 'was', 'difficult', 'identify', 'whiny', 'lazy', 'adult', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'friends', 'attempt', 'get', 'job', 'bails', 'often', 'band', 'practice', 'minor', 'under-aged', 'Knives', 'Chau', 'called', 'Chinese', 'apparently', 'Canadian', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'Pilgrim', 'character', 'never', 'reduced', 'white', 'guy', 'Euro-looking', 'guy', 'cheats', 'dumps', 'faithful', 'under-aged', 'girlfriend', 'woman', 'commitment', 'issues', 'find', 'sad', 'wrong', 'watch', 'adult', 'men', 'date', 'under-aged', 'girls', 'was', 'disappointed', 'one', 'dimensional', 'Asian', 'American', 'characters', 'were', 'either', 'killed', 'case', 'Knives', 'Chau', 'punched', 'face', 'expected', 'more', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Shawn', 'Dead', 'director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'something', 'effect', 'thought', 'plot', 'was', '5', 'minute', 'film', 'stretched', 'feature', 'length.The', 'original', 'Matrix', 'executed', 'developed', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'much', 'better', 'late', '90s', 'wanted', 'film', 'protagonist', 'based', 'positive', 'reviews', 'However', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'was', 'better', 'executed', 'modern', 'romance', 'more', 'developed', 'characters', 'plot', 'terms', 'genre', 'inspired', 'comic', 'books', 'enjoyed', 'Spiderman', 'Batman', 'C.', 'Nolan', 'better', 'options']",N/A

1348536,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B003L20IE2,Armando N. Roman,"[27, 46]","There's something funny about Scott Pilgrim vs the World. Any bad review for the movie automatically gets tons of negative votes/feedback by people who can't accept that not everyone liked it, and feel that they have to defend the movie at all times. Arguments about how the movie was true to the source material, how it catered to 'real gamers', and more, but never any defense about why this is a good movie in their eyes. Your movie can have all the retro game references in the world and be true to the comics its based on, but that doesn't make it any less interesting. I grew up with Atari and NES games- I get the whole dropped coins from beaten enemies bit. Wow, a warp zone. Yeah, I get it. Watching this movie, I felt like I was watching something an NES threw up. I didn't laugh once, didn't care about any of the characters, and was fed up with it before it reached the halfway mark. Michael Cera being the star here didn't help either. Once again, he mumbles his way through another movie.The basis of the movie is easily summed up in the trailers: Scott Pilgrim falls in love with Ramona Flowers, a delivery girl for Amazon who dyes her hair on a regular basis, wears goggles, and dresses like she's ready for a cosplay convention. She shows some affection for Scott, and even gets in bed with him pretty quickly, but decides against anything happening just as spontaneously. Soon after, Scott learns he must beat her seven evil exes for some reason (well, the main reason being because the movie plays out like a game), and goes up against them to win her over. Or at least, that's what he hopes to do. Ramona isn't exactly the most helpful person in the world when it comes to figuring things out, and she's a bit of a loser herself.The movie's supposed to be based on the comics, and that's something that most of the fans like. But a movie shouldn't have to be just for the fans, especially a movie that got a worldwide box office release. Something I thought was funny was that the special preview did great at SDCC last year (of course it did- the crowd was nothing but comic fans), but once released nationwide, it bombed. Despite me being a big geek myself, I think this movie only appeals for people who are the biggest possible geeks out there, or people who love movies that rely on references to games. Again, I understood that this is a satire but it bored the heck outta me. I didn't care if the boring Scott Pilgrim got the boring girl who tries too hard to be different and cool by being disinterested in most things. Why Ramona even interested Scott went right over my head. Each of the evil exes had me rolling my eyes whenever they showed up, and the fights with them didn't work. If they wanted to put he comic on the big screen, why not just make it an animated film? Seeing Pilgrim fly around punching and kicking, I felt like I was watching a rough cut of the Dragon Ball Evolution movie. I will give the film a little bit of credit for being creative with one of the ex's fights: an Indian guy who has a kind of Bollywood style scene during the fight was a good touch. Over-production was a big problem too. How many times do we need the text 'BOOM!' or an emoticon to flash on the screen when there's a sound effect or something? Ok, we get it- it's a comic/game. You'd think after a while that this would tone down or just stop completely, but it didn't. This alone made the movie feel much longer than it was to me, and I don't get why more directors haven't learned from Sin City on how to do a comic-to-film right.The blu-ray is great though- the visuals/audio are top notch, and if you have the right home theater setup, this is a great sample disc to use to show it off to friends and family. The extras are loaded as well for people who liked the movie enough to go through them.I think Scott Pilgrim vs the World is suited at a much younger audience, maybe people who are just now playing the older games that it takes after. People who really, really, REALLY love games. And people who like reading tiny text boxes with little tidbits on every single character that appears on-screen. And people who still cling onto overused internet buzzwords like 'epic' and 'ftw'. This is one that I thought I was going to like, but in the end, I was bored to death. Scott Pilgrim just has one of those fan bases that's full of people rabid for anything Scott Pilgrim, as shown by the lack of negative feedback on the game for not having online support.

1348540,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B003L20IE2,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 1]","22-year-old Canadian slacker Scott Pilgrim faces ridicule from his friends and bandmates when he hooks up with 17-year-old high-schooler Knives Chau. However, his life becomes infinitely more complicated when he dumps Chau for enigmatically cool American girl Ramona Flowers. Flowers' seven 'evil exes' have decided that Scott must defeat them all in order to date Ramona. Scott is forced into seven battles of escalating difficulty as he tries to win Ramona's heart and make amends for his rough treatment of Chau.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is an interesting film. It's a full-scale, all-out assault on the viewer's sensibilities, with radical shifts of tone and pace as the film moves from what appears to be a grounded comedy with some geeky overtones to a flat-out fantastical cartoon-made-flesh, with characters levitating through the air and unleashing 'demon hipster chicks' in battle, before shifting back to an intense relationship drama for five minutes before side-shifting into a bloodless Tarantino movie. In many ways cool, but it makes for an at times uneven film.The movie is directed by Edgar Wright, who previously helmed the flicks Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and the TV series Spaced. This film marks his first major work without the partnership of Simon Pegg (who was writing and filming Paul at the same time; Pegg and Wright will apparently be soon reconvening for a third film). The film also marks Wright's first work with an American-sized movie budget: Scott Pilgrim cost ten times as much as Hot Fuzz and twenty times as much as Shaun of the Dead to make and every cent of it can be seen on screen. The visuals in the movie are kinetic, explosive and rich (multiple viewings may be required to take everything in), though never too confusing. The fight scenes are pretty good, and the choreography makes you believe that Michael Cera could kick some backside, which is an impressive achievement. As an action movie - the American Kung Fu Hustle is a comparison I've seen made - it works very well.As a relationship drama/comedy it's more varied. It's not helped that central character Scott Pilgrim is rather unlikable. I know that's the point of both comic and film, but he doesn't really improve and become more likable over the course of the film, at least not until the last few seconds of the movie. Michael Cera is also pretty much just Michael Cera in the film, only really springing to life during the battles (particularly the bass battle, when he brings the required attitude) and the rest of the time doing his whiny indie actor spiel, which risks becoming tiresome. In a film full of villains exploding into coins, music-summoned CGI dragons and people reincarnating after using an 'extra life', the most fantastical thing is that any of these women would find Pilgrim even remotely attractive.Luckily, the rest of the cast is almost flawlessly excellent. Kieran Culkin is superb as Pilgrim's 'cool gay flatmate' who acts as his moral compass, whilst Anna Pill is suitably demented as drummer Kim (whose band introductions are among the funnier things in the film). Ellen Wong and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are both great as Scott's love interests Knives Chau and Ramona Flowers. Winstead hits the note that Cera fails to by successfully portraying a sympathetic character despite her many bad decisions and judgment calls.The film also has a few nice ironic cameo appearances. Brandon Routh (the ex-Superman) and Chris Evans (Captain America/the Human Torch) play two of Ramona's evil exes, a rival bassist with psi-powers gained through veganism and a skateboarder-turned-action-movie-star. Both actors take the mickey out of their tough guy roles with excellent comic timing, not to mention Wright reusing the Spaced approach of getting characters to do things they don't want to by using the magic phrase, ""There's girls watching"".Once you get past the great performances (a variable lead aside) and startling visuals, the movie is effectively a metaphor for characters having to confront the demons of their past and not let bad history restrict the potential for happiness in the future. Or something along those lines. It's also a crazy action flick with tons of excellent geek references which will appeal to those who know what Scott Pilgrim is talking about when he references the bassline to the theme tune for Final Fantasy II (which I believe is actually Final Fantasy V, but given a different number due to...sorry, getting off-topic there) and where the beautiful 'L word' is 'lesbian'.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (****) goes on a little too long and towards the end becomes repetitive (I think it might have worked better with five evil exes), and Wright's visual brilliance becomes a little over-manic when not restrained by a stronger writing partner like Simon Pegg, but overall this is a fun and frantic movie with strong performances and an offbeat sense of humour.",4,Fun frantic and clever with a few

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World may not be the most interesting film storyline-wise, truth be told, but it's certainly the most fascinating to watch.Basically it takes a simple love story between Michael Cera's character and a crush he develops on this, how shall we say, solid, emotionless girl who dies her hair different colors, but... the problem is that he's already dating a cute Asian girl, so what does Michael do?He falls in love with both, of course!  Of course he's actually more interested in the hair-dying girl because it was love at first sight the moment he spotted her.  Interestingly, the girl doesn't just dismiss him immediately- they develop a relationship of sorts.  Perhaps not how you'd think.  Sort of like a little more than a friendship but not quite boyfriend/girlfriend.Michael's in a rock band, and his dream is to one day become a famous, legitimate band.  Throughout the film his band performs for large audiences.However, NEITHER of these two storylines are actually the focus here.  No siree!  What's *actually* the focus is the highly unusual Matrix-like fighting segments that take place on screen between Michael Cera's character and his enemies.  In other words, every so often Michael will suddenly find myself face to face in an intense battle with these mysterious, highly advanced foes.  Why?  I have no earthly idea, haha.Alright, there IS actually a reason why.  He's obsessed with this one tournament fighter at the arcade, and he's determined to break the highest scores.  In order to do this... he has to fight his real-life enemies Matrix-style.  It's unlike anything I've ever experienced before in an action/adventure, which makes me think the words ""science fiction"" should be thrown in the description somewhere.Also, pertaining to these fights, they interact with Michael's real-life problems involving his girlfriends so he finds himself battling them for the sake of integrity I guess?  It should be noted that, despite some major butt kickings he receives, he's never seriously injured since this *is* an adventure type movie after all.It should also be noted that I wasn't expecting this film to be so nerdy and childish, but the fact it's so different from anything I've ever seen before gives it a serious boost in my ratings scale.  Otherwise it's just another teenage romance comedy that's not particularly funny.I like all the references and sound effects that came from the old Super Nintendo classic The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.  That's one of the best Zelda games of all-time for those who've never played it, and surely considered a classic on nearly every single video game list that centers around the ""best games of all time"".  Also worth noting is the reference to the old rock/glam band from the 70's T.Rex and their hit song ""Teenage Dream"".

I wasn't really sold on the original preview personally and I thought he was going to be wrong. I'm also not familiar with the comics by Bryan Lee O'Malley. After watching, I can admit I WAS WRONG!

He makes this movie with his outstanding performance.I watched the movie On-Demand first and really liked it, then I bought it on Blu-ray and was completely blown away by the special effects and great sound. It's really the finest mix of a movie with video game quality sound and special effects that I've ever seen.Scott Pilgrim is a great character, but he isn't the only one in the movie. I really liked Kim (Alison Pil), Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) and who wouldn't love Young Neil (Johnny Simmons).If you love Blu-ray movies with amazing picture and sound, you need to see this movie.

1348546,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B003L20IE2,B. Martin,"[33, 122]","I am either not young enough or not cool enough to appreciate Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, but if this movie is the epitome of being young and cool, I think I'll pass.  Based on a graphic novel, the film version tells the story of Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), a twentysomething part time bass player who falls for the new girl in town.  Her name is Ramona Flowers and Scott is instantly smitten with her.  The catch is that in order to be with her, he must defeat her seven deadly exes, each of whom is presented as a super villian with some sort of superpowers that Scott must defeat in video game/comic book fashion.  Why?  I suppose the point that the movie is trying to make is that the baggage and loose ends from our past relationships will catch up with us and hurt our future relationships if we choose to ignore and run from them.It really doesn't matter what the point is, however, becasue everything in this movie-the characthers, the plot, the themes (or lack thereof)-is secondary to the film's hyperactive visual style.  The movie plays like a giant mash up of video games and comic books not only in it's pacing but in its visual style as well.  The film can't seem to stay focused on any one scene or idea for more than a few seconds before it has to jump to something else that will keep our eyes glued to the screen. This might not be a problem if the movie wasn't so self aware about how cool and funny it thinks it is or if even one of the characters wasn't a completely annoying, self absorbed emotional infant.  Maybe that's the point of the movie--that these are young adults who have yet to reach emotional maturity.  But I doubt it.  In the end, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is all about how flashy and cool a movie it is.  For some, that will be enough.

1348550,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B003L20IE2,Brian A. Schar,"[1, 2]","""Scott Pilgrim"" gets off to a confusing start, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  It's not clear if some or all of the action is taking place inside Scott Pilgrim's head.  The superimposed 60s' style Batman comic book graphics start off annoying and twee rather than creative.  But there's enough good stuff to keep the movie going.Then, when the first ex appeared, an Indian-Canadian named Matthew Patel, the penny dropped and I understood exactly what this movie was: Bollywood crossed with old Nintendo games, for American audiences.  In Bollywood world, you don't worry so much about whether anything makes sense; you just roll with it.  Once I stopped wondering whether the action was all in Scott's head or not, I enjoyed the movie a lot more.  Plus, we discover shortly afterward that in Scott Pilgrim World, these epic fights with the 7 Evil Ex's are all real.  How much you can buy into this will determine how much you like this movie.  It's a similar thing as ""Angel World"" in the Charlies' Angels movies.  If you can suspend your disbelief about what's going on, you will love it, but if you can't overcome that hurdle, you won't.""Scott Pilgrim"" also does a nice job of giving its title character some self-awareness.  Geeks can be jerks like anyone else, and we often don't see it because geeks are used to feeling like victims.  Part of his gaining the self-respect power-up was realizing that he hadn't treated others as well as he wished he would be treated himself.Let's not forget Vegan Academy or the Vegan Police, which alone are worth watching this entire movie.  Michael Cera doing wire-fu is also worth the price of admission.As usual, the deleted scenes were deleted for a reason, and the alternate ending was the alternate ending for a reason as well.  I will not provide spoilers, but it's obvious from a handful of short deleted scenes and the alternate ending that they were playing with this wrapping up in a different way.  I'm glad they settled on the ending we had; the other one would have wrecked Scott Pilgrim's character development and concluded the movie on a jarring, throw-your-shoe-at-the-TV way.""Scott Pilgrim"" is at least worth a rent.

Fields ""Making your brain hurt since 2005.""","[2, 3]","So, when I heard that ""Scott Pilgrim"" was being made into an actual movie, I gave it a shrug of interest...then I found out it was being directed by Edgar Wright (""Hot Fuzz"", ""Shaun of the Dead"") and I knew I needed to see it. I'm glad I did. The film (this is a no spoiler review) is top notch for Wright and really bends his usual comedic style into a new and more appealing vein. Few to nobody has done any films that focus the movie onto videogame references and put such perspective light onto the characters. For someone like Scott he probably contextualizes life through videogames and that translates into the film with full on kung-fu battles, points, power ups, extra lives, and super-powers. This makes for a more visual and engrossing movie. The plot is solid and the characters are excellent, right down to the supporting cast. The audience isn't forced to like Scott and even seems to give you the option to make up your own mind about him. He's the kind of fallible protagonist that a lot of movies just don't seem to have these days. I could go into far more detail and plot information but that would only violate my strict (""No Spoiler"") policy on reviews.My only grievance is that the film overuses gay jokes until they stop being funny and only turn out more annoying. Some folks, I suspect, will have some issue with their being in the movie at all. Though, for me, while it was a constant annoyance it didn't spoil the overall experience of the film.

I would say that there is no middle ground with this one, but I would probably be wrong. My wife and I watched this with another couple and I loved it, the other guy liked it, his girl made fun of it, but kept watching and my wife hated it so much she made nasty comments throughout about how stupid it was and eventually went to sleep. I was glad when she finally did because she was annoying me to the point I was about to turn her into coins just like in the movie.One way or the other, you have to admire the incredible visuals, colors, visions and creativity that knows what it is and doesn't try to please those who will hate. The creators knew that they were making a polorizing movie that some would hate and think was stupid, but they also knew what they wanted to do and they did it with full zesto.SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD is a throwback to an era of videogaming that only those who know it will get it, or appreciate it. As the movie zips and zaps back and forth with creative visuals that have rooms rippling and bouncing as rock music tests the boundaries of speakers and characters fly through the air as if they were living a real life game of MORTAL KOMBAT, it doesn't take us long to realize we are seeing something we've never seen before.The sound throughout the movie is like your walking through a booming claustrophobic arcade room with pinball games bouncing balls off of double score targets, Mario brothers, Pac-Man, Mortal Kombat & slot machines. In fact, SCOTT PILGRIM most likely won't be, but it should be up for SOUND & VISUAL oscars this year.In the middle of all the creative visuals and videogame throwback throughout the film, SCOTT PILGRIM manages to put together an insanely interesting romance story between Scott's vision of dreamy beauty Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), himself and Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), who is still in high school and is out of her mind obsessed with everything PILGRIM related.SCOTT PILGRIM is for all those out there who wanted something different because if you look past the ridiculousness that some people see, you will find absolute brilliance in sound editing, visuals and creativity.

1348563,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003L20IE2,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 8]","If you love action, if you live for comedy, if you get a nostalgic high from the electronic beep-boop sounds of eight-bit arcade games like ""Pac Man"" and ""Space Invaders,"" then ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is the movie for you. This is mindless filmmaking at its best - no messages, no agenda, no introspection, just pure juvenile fun from start to finish. It's adapted from the graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, but its style really owes more to video games, the structure fast and frenetic, the music loud and pulsating, the battles cool and choreographed, the visuals bright and bursting with creative digital effects. Watching this movie was a little like watching the 2008 adaptation of ""Speed Racer,"" a woefully underappreciated film that stirred within me sensations of excitement and awe. Simply looking at the film was an experience unto itself.Michael Cera plays the title character in his usual unassuming way, perpetually caught in that gray zone between shy nerdiness and loveably eccentric. But then there are those select moments when he becomes an amped-up video game hero, fighting his opponents as if channeling his inner martial arts instructor. It's a surprisingly seamless transition. The only thing missing from these moments are shots of hands holding a game controller, the thumb of one hand furiously flying over the A and B buttons, the thumb of the other hand scrambling to push the up, down, left, and right arrows in the correct order. I've long since grown out of video games, but I fondly remember the days of the original Nintendo and Super Nintendo systems; my summer days were often spent in front of the TV, me trying to navigate Mario on his quest to save Princess Toadstool from the evil Bowser.I digress. Before Scott Pilgrim becomes a video game character, he's the bass guitarist for a Toronto-based band called Sex Bob-omb (a reference to ""Super Mario Bros.,"" thank you very much). Although he's twenty-two years old, he's dating a seventeen-year-old high school student, the always cheery Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). His band mates and their tagalong fan (Alison Pill, Mark Webber, and Johnny Simmons) disapprove. So does his gay roommate (Kieran Culkin). Then he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an American with a mysterious past and a routine of changing the color of her hair every couple of weeks (it goes from pink to blue to green). The two form a connection of sorts; one could even call it a relationship. Scott, of course, fails to tell Ramona about Knives. Likewise, he doesn't tell Knives about Ramona. This will no doubt come back to haunt him in due time.But before that can happen, he must contend with Ramona's past, which literally comes crashing down onto him. Six guys and one girl, known as the League of Evil Exes, all challenge Scott video game-style for Ramona's affections. Basically, he must defeat them all if he's to continue dating Ramona. I will not describe every ex, nor will I describe every battle. I will say that the digital effects are put to their best use during these scenes. Every punch, kick, jab, and push makes a sound that's literally spelled out over the characters' heads, much like in the 1960s ""Batman"" series. Players summon forth advanced moves and supernatural abilities. Points rack up before our eyes. A one-up eventually floats in front of Scott, looking much like a ""Super Mario Bros."" mushroom. Best of all is when an opponent is destroyed - their bodies explode in a mass of quarters.Two especially memorable Evil Exes are played by Chris Evans and Brandon Routh. The former is a hotshot movie star who talks like a cross between Steven Segal and Clint Eastwood and is aided by an entourage of stunt doubles. The latter is a strict vegan whose diet has earned him super special abilities, such as glowing white eyes and the ability to read other people's thoughts. Villains are always so much cooler than the heroes. In this case, they're also quite a bit funnier, their rivalry with Scott overshadowed by their over the top personality quirks.As is the case with most video games, it all comes down to the final boss. His name is Gideon Graves (Jason Schwartzman), and he raises the stakes by putting not only Scott's life on the line, but also the future of Sex Bob-omb. Scott is eventually forced to reconsider his feelings for Ramona, since there seems to be a very dangerous pattern in her dating history. Is it her he must save? Or does he have to save himself first? Whatever the case, you can rest assured that it will involve a lot of bonus points and extra lives. No pause button, though. No need for one. ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is a film that beautifully draws you into a fast-paced frenzy; to slow down would be to miss the point entirely. Like a real video game, it's an action-packed, colorful blur of sight and sound. I don't think I've had more fun at the movies all summer.",4,"Player One, Fight!",1281657600,"08 13, 2010",2010,4914,"['love', 'action', 'live', 'comedy', 'get', 'nostalgic', 'high', 'electronic',

Bitter, repressed twerp please queue on the left to snark at me.Scott Pilgrim VS the World is a delightful, enjoyable movie based on a series of graphic novels. It tells the story of Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), a twenty-two-year-old slacker living with a gay roommate (Kieran Culkin), in Toronto. The most notable thing is his life currently is that he's in a band (""We're terrible,"" he says of it), called Sex Bob-omb (only funny to certain people), and he's recently started dating a seventeen-year-old girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). He is, to put it mildly, somewhat disconnected from reality and is, for example, surprised to hear that movies are sometimes made in Toronto (for the record it was nice to finally see one both filmed and set there, though I wish they'd filmed it in Hollywood and claimed it was Toronto).His precious little life begins to change when he dreams about a girl named Romona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and then runs into her at a library. He later finds her at a party, totally fails to hook up with her and eventually meets her by ordering from Amazon, for whom she does deliveries. The two start to bond and soon begin dating. Scott's quite happy with this arrangement until he finds out about Romona's seven evil exes, each of whom is determined to fight to the death for her!I flat loved this movie! Everything about it worked for me. The casting, especially Cera and Culkin, was dead-perfect from what I've read of the books (only the first two so far, but I'm working on it!). The exes were all entertaining and, oh, dear, was there ever plenty of nice eye-candy to oogle, from Young Neil, to Wallace to the Twins! I do believe I'm having an attack of the vapors! *fans self*The visual style is wonderful! Everything pops quite nicely and the anime/comic style graphics and captions work out really well, when they could've just been a cheesy distraction. The direction by Edgar Wright (best known for Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz), really brings together this admittedly strange world and, happily, doesn't lose control of things.The movie is a bit niche in some ways.

It was supposed to be over-the-top and campy. Michael Cera is the antihero. Asking questions like ""How can this dweeb get such hot girls?"" is just as ridiculous as asking how quarters fell from the sky when the villians were killed. This was SUCH an uber-hipster movie. And as I'm sure everyone knows, hipsters do it ironically. That's why Scott wore that ZERO shirt and that's why all the girls looked like comic book characters...because they were. This is not a film to be taken seriously. It's a silly little comedy and I find that its viewers shouldn't try to make anything more out of it than what it is. I took off a star because I didn't think it had ENOUGH funny dialogue. Certain fight scenes seemed to drag on too long without any funny lines to fill up the lull. Also, the camera angles sometimes made me dizzy. I loved the retro video game feel, though. A solid 4/5.UPDATE: I just got the Blu-Ray/DVD in the mail and when I tried to redeem the digital copy it said the code expired.

You have to take it with a grain of salt though, like you would with knight and day. There just movies that are completely unrealistic, yet very entertaining and something for everyone. More for adults then children in my opinion. I also think since both hot fuzz and shaun of the dead were rated R and more violent and vulgar, Wright should have gone a little further and done a ""kickass"" style movie with actual blood and where the people in the movie actually get bruises and bloodied up.

Even though it is probably targeted to a younger audience then myself, it might be better suited to my generation because of the video games it more closely resembles. At first I thought Scott was going to have to get some kind of training to fight the ex-boyfriends, but he was ready to go from the beginning. The fights are way over the top just like Street Fighter. high flying kicks, over powered punches. It is wonderful to watch.

1348574,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003L20IE2,C. Sawin,"[1, 1]","Next to Inception and Predators, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World was my most anticipated film of the year. Edgar Wright  has yet to disappoint as a director and the film looked like it would feature plenty of comedy and action with a little bit of romance that would be presented in a unique way that would hopefully satisfy that part of me that always seems to be craving something more original from Hollywood. Thankfully, like a child who has a strong idea of what that big Christmas present is sitting under the tree, that's exactly what I received.The entire film looks fantastically retro as certain sounds are brought to life with animated text while weapons the characters use are heavily pixelated like they're taken straight out of an 8-bit video game. Scott Pilgrim recycles recognizable video game sounds in a way that triggers nostalgia, but uses them in a way that feels fresh. Even the way the film is edited like the way the split screen is used to show all seven evil exes on screen at once in the trailer or how Scott's everyday activities bleed together because he's so absorbed in his thoughts about Ramona seems to be done in a way that makes the film stand out in comparison to others.The writing may be Scott Pilgrim's best attribute. There are so many witty one-liners littered throughout the film and the storyline unfolds in a way that grabs hold of your attention the second that 8-bit version of the Universal Logo comes up on screen and doesn't let go until those last remaining seconds of the film. The cast was surprisingly solid, as well. I was already excited about Chris Evans and Jason Schwartzman being in the film, but Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ellen Wong, and Kieran Culkin all managed to make a pretty lasting impression with this film.Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is one of the most inventive, cleverly written, eye-popping, and visually appealing action comedies to ever grace the big screen.

The plot is really that simple, but definitely original. Styled like a video game movie in an alternate universe that's not that different from our own, SPVTW is seriously one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year.The movie is set in Toronto, Canada, and features a cast of characters to which maybe only one is over the age of 30, and they are only in it briefly. You really cannot compare this movie to anything else, but if I was forced to I would say it's like if Kill Bill was crossed with Dude, Where's My Car.I've often said that one sign of a great movie is if when it ends I'm ready to watch it again. This is one of those movies. I saw it twice during the first week of theatrical release, and will buy it as soon as it comes out on November 9th.  It won't be for everyone, and should definitely be avoided by those who have a headache going in, but if you want to see a totally entertaining movie that is unlike most everything else out there (which is a rarity these days), get a life and see this movie.

Scott, an unlikely heartbreaker who has a habit of going through  girlfriends like he goes through those stylish graphic t-shirts he wears, is dating 17 year-old Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) while trying to get over his previous valet, Envy Adams (Brie Larson). But Scott breaks it off with Knives when he encounters Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), deadpan Amazon delivery girl who dyes her hair a different color every week. But if Scott is to keep dating Ramona, he must defeat her seven evil exes, such as mystically powered Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha), movie star Lucas Lee (Chris Evans), superpowered vegan Todd Ingram (Brandon Routh), and music mogul Gideon Graves (Jason Schwartzman) in video game-inspired combat, all while trying to win a record deal in a Battle of the Bands competition.Recent movie adaptations of comic books have attempted to ground themselves in realism. However, Scott Pilgrim vs The World, directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz)adapted from the Bryan Lee O'Malley's series of books, gleefully embraces the surreal elements of its source material. The books reference and utilize tropes from video games, comic books, and Japanese anime and manga, and the film also utilizes those elements with splashy effect. When characters get punched, graphics like ""Poom!"" and ""K-Row!"" pop up on screen. When a bell rings, the word ""R-I-I-I-I-N-G!"" flies across the screen. Characters launch into high-flying kung-fu battles while those around them look on without much shock. And when characters are defeated in battle, they burst into a pile of coins. It is one of the most literal interpretations of a comic book ever committed to film, and you could hold drinking games for all the references the film makes to popular - and not so popular - culture (The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Seinfeld, Dance Dance Revolution, just to name a few). What the film lacks in realism, it more than makes up for with sheer fun in the absurdity of it all.It's also worth mentioning the fun array of characters brought to life by the actors portraying them. Michael Cera seems to be amounting a good fortune by playing awkward losers, so whether you like him or hate him, he fits the role rather well. And for once, his character ""mans up"" toward the end of the film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Ramona as a dry, aloof girl trying to escape the broken relationships of her past. Ellen Wong's Knives Chau is a hyper-emotional schoolgirl straight out of Japanese anime and manga, and Kieran Culkin steals just about every scene he's in as Wallace, Scott's ""cool gay roommate,"" who acts as Scott's personal peanut gallery during Scott's battles.Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is one of the most fun, imaginative action-comedies in recent memory, and more than a worthy buy.",5,"An endearing, giddy, fun blend of video games, manga, and musical elements",1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,2924,"['Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'lanky', 'mopped-topped', '20-something', 'bassist', 'Toronto', 'garage', 'band', 'called', 'Sex', 'Bob-Omb', 'Scott', 'unlikely', 'heartbreaker', 'who', 'habit', 'going', 'girlfriends', 'stylish', 'graphic', 't-shirts', 'dating', '17', 'year-old', 'Knives', 'Chau', 'Ellen', 'Wong', 'trying', 'get', 'previous', 'valet', 'Envy', 'Adams', 'Brie', 'Larson', 'Scott', 'off', 'Knives', 'when', 'Ramona', 'Flowers', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'deadpan', 'Amazon', 'delivery', 'girl', 'who', 'hair', 'different', 'color', 'week', 'Scott', 'keep', 'dating', 'Ramona', 'must', 'defeat', 'seven', 'evil', 'exes', 'such', 'mystically', 'powered', 'Matthew', 'Patel', 'Satya', 'Bhabha', 'movie', 'star', 'Lucas', 'Lee', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'superpowered', 'vegan', 'Todd', 'Ingram', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'music', 'mogul', 'Gideon', 'Graves', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'video', 'game-inspired', 'combat', 'trying', 'win', 'record', 'deal', 'Battle', 'Bands', 'competition.Recent', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'comic', 'books', 'have', 'attempted', 'ground', 'realism', 'However', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'directed', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'adapted', 'Bryan', 'Lee', ""O'Malley"", 'series', 'books', 'gleefully', 'surreal', 'elements', 'source', 'material', 'books', 'reference', 'utilize', 'tropes', 'video', 'games', 'comic', 'books', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'manga', 'film', 'also', 'elements', 'splashy', 'effect', 'When', 'characters', 'get', 'punched', 'graphics', 'Poom', 'K-Row', 'up', 'screen', 'When', 'bell', 'rings', 'word', 'R-I-I-I-I-N-G', 'screen', 'Characters', 'launch', 'high-flying', 'kung-fu', 'battles', 'look', 'much', 'shock', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'defeated', 'battle', 'burst', 'pile', 'coins', 'one', 'most', 'literal', 'interpretations', 'comic', 'book', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'could', 'hold', 'drinking', 'games', 'references', 'film', 'popular', 'not', 'so', 'popular', 'culture', 'Legend', 'Zelda', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Seinfeld', 'Dance', 'Dance', 'Revolution', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'What', 'film', 'realism', 'more', 'up', 'sheer', 'fun', 'absurdity', 'all.It', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'fun', 'array', 'characters', 'brought', 'life', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'be', 'amounting', 'good', 'fortune', 'playing', 'awkward', 'losers', 'like', 'hate', 'role', 'rather', 'well', 'once', 'character', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Ramona', 'dry', 'aloof', 'girl', 'trying', 'escape', 'broken', 'relationships', 'past', 'Ellen', 'Wong', 'Knives', 'Chau', 'hyper-emotional', 'schoolgirl', 'straight', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'manga', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'steals', 'just', 'scene', 'as', 'Wallace', 'Scott', 'cool', 'gay', 'roommate', 'who', 'Scott', 'personal', 'peanut', 'gallery', 'Scott', 'battles.Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'vs', 'World', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'imaginative', 'action-comedies', 'recent', 'memory', 'more', 'worthy', 'buy']",N/A
1348589,A8B3WBWEI3TVG,B003L20IE2,"E. Ambrose ""Fellshot""","[1, 1]","Well, seeing as how most of my friends are nerdy we all went out to see Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. The initial premise (as mentioned repeatedly in the trailers) is that Scott falls for a girl (Ramona) who has had an unhappy string of relationships with a bunch of nutcases and Scott has to defeat all of them. Just going off of the trailer, I was expecting a pretty straightforwards romp with hyperactive graphics everywhere. What I got was something much better.First of all the story is not as simple as first impression would indicate. Scott is also quite the heartbreaker in the film and his experience mirrors Ramona's a lot. I would even go so far to say that he doesn't so much as defeat the evil exes as much as come to terms with how he broke up with various girls and how his previous ugly break up with Envy has really slammed him. At least, that's what I got with the ""fight"" with the Evil Twin Scott. All the other characters are just as screwed up and just as awkwardly nerdy in their own way. Anyway there is a rather cute little story about respecting yourself and other people underneath all of the flash and bang.The flash and bang isn't all that bad either. This features probably the most fun I've seen with ""Bam!"" ""Pow!"" and ""Thud!"" since I was ten and was still watching Batman with Adam West. It's rather like watching a live action comic, because the sound inserts are used where one would expect to find them in a comic, including the ringing phones and headdesking. Each of the fights with the evil exes are different and entertaining in completely different ways. I loved the bass battle between Scott and ex number 3, if only because I was the only one in the theater who realized what they were playing (Final Fantasy fight music) and thoroughly amused by it.In general, I would call the visuals and the narrative style distinctly and awesomely campy. It makes utterly no pretense of being anything else and gives it a giant bear hug topped off with a big sloppy kiss instead. Anyone who has ever played and liked a video game of any kind will probably find some in-joke to chuckle at. The acting and camera work is completely tongue in cheek and it pulls it together.I wouldn't look at this film as the next Oscar winner, but the story is better than I thought, the visuals serve the narrative, the soundtrack rocks the house and the jokes are funny. There's not much more I could ask for out of this film.

I read the graphic novels shortly before the film was released, and I absolutely fell in love with them. I was really excited over this movie because the trailers literally brought the books to life. When I finally saw this movie at a midnight show, I walked out of that theatre with a smile that stayed with me for many days. I had finally seen a movie that did it's source material justice. For those that have read the books, yes they are better in many ways, but the movie is a creation all its own. It took the best parts of the books, and then the movie adapted them to better fit a movie. It did not slave to remain faithful to every last detail of the books, but it shrewdly chose the best parts for fans of the books to appreciate while still keeping those who hadn't read them entertained.

1348591,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003L20IE2,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD (2010). Hmm. Intriguing title. Trailer looked good, all 3 seconds of it. I thought about this film long before I watched it. It made me curious: no doubt it is pure satire, but was it that the creators got high and did a 12-hour marathon watching TRON (see my review), TANK GIRL, and STAR WARS? I've seen reviews that refer to ""the books""...and I discovered it is a ""manga"" comic book series.Must admit, though: I do not care. No need for comic books. This film is 100% better than KICK-ASS (see my review) and is one of the funniest films I've enjoyed in many a moon. The eternally girlish Michael Cera, who hasn't done a decent film since the repugnant JUNO (see my review), turns in what is for him a powerhouse performance as Scott Pilgrim. Scott's two biggest problems as far as I could tell were that he is Canadian and is completely more gay than his gay roommate Wallace (a charming Kieran Culkin).When Scott, bass player for a pretty decent band, falls in love with notorious American chanteuse Ramona Flowers (a subtle and gorgeous Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he's really head-over-heels. The trouble is this is a video-game reality and Scott's game with Ramona has only begun. He has to battle her seven evil ex-boyfriends and KILL THEM.As he reveals incredible superpowers that go gleefully ignored, he mows down several of the ex-fiends (one is a lesbian who accuses Ramona of being a ""Has-bian"")--only to be showered in heavy coinage as he dispatches them. With each battle, Scott faces his own demons and he learns from it.Here I see (at least for teens and twentysomethings) some deep metaphysical and psychological truths coated in video-game and STAR WARS candy. Not a bad trick really...religious teachers have been seeking this alchemical formula for millennia (I stand accused). Director Edgar Wright (SHAUN OF THE DEAD) did well. I hope this is the start of a great career for this weird English director.This film brought back lovely memories of what it is like to be in my 20's...oh, why go on! It made me laugh and the fight scenes were so good I thought Scott Pilgrim reminded me of Michael the Archangel. (That, I suspect, was unintentional on the director's part.) I have my mild crushes and Cera is one of them, though Kieran looks pretty darned good too. And I like the same nonchalant attitude toward the gay community here as the attitude towards the mystical video superpowers possessed by Scott, Ramona and ""Knives"" (an adorable Ellen Wong).Some great work is overlooked by fans. One is the blow-you-away soundtrack, and secondly SCOTT is one of the best adaptations ever. Not what you think: the old, corny Chinese ""kung fu"" movie has been adapted so beautifully, perfectly shaped into white culture. (In one scene, ""Knives"" points menacingly at Ramona and tells her, ""I'll destroy you: you broke the heart of the one who broke mine!!"") Somehow I expected the dialogue to be out of sync with the actors' lips. Hilarious.I suspect I'll never see its like again...unless someone presses the ""continue"" button before the countdown ends.Can't say what is up with the satanic superproducer Gideon Graves (the eternally doofy Jason Schwartzman)--maybe just a nod to THE PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE. Also it's hard to believe George Lucas didn't sue these guys for copying the lightsabers, but oh well. This thing is FUN. It is FUNNY. It is totally, umm, worth it or whatever and stuff.",5,"""I'm in lesbians with you""",1289433600,"11 11, 2010",2010,3436,"['SCOTT', 'PILGRIM', 'VS', 'THE', 'WORLD', '2010', 'Hmm', 'Intriguing', 'title', 'Trailer', 'looked', 'good', '3', 'seconds', 'thought', 'film', 'long', 'watched', 'made', 'curious', 'doubt', 'pure', 'satire', 'was', 'creators', 'got', 'high', 'did', '12-hour', 'marathon', 'watching', 'TRON', 'see', 'review', 'TANK', 'GIRL', 'STAR', 'WARS', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviews', 'refer', 'books', 'discovered', 'manga', 'comic', 'book', 'series.Must', 'admit', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'need', 'comic', 'books', 'film', '100', '%', 'better', 'KICK-ASS', 'see', 'review', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'many', 'moon', 'eternally', 'girlish', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'who', ""n't"", 'done', 'decent', 'film', 'repugnant', 'JUNO', 'see', 'review', 'what', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'Scott', 'two', 'biggest', 'problems', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'were', 'Canadian', 'completely', 'more', 'gay', 'gay', 'roommate', 'Wallace', 'charming', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', '.When', 'Scott', 'bass', 'player', 'pretty', 'decent', 'band', 'love', 'notorious', 'American', 'chanteuse', 'Ramona', 'Flowers', 'subtle', 'gorgeous', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'really', 'head-over-heels', 'trouble', 'video-game', 'reality', 'Scott', 'game', 'Ramona', 'only', 'begun', 'battle', 'seven', 'evil', 'ex-boyfriends', 'KILL', 'THEM.As', 'incredible', 'superpowers', 'go', 'gleefully', 'ignored', 'down', 'several', 'ex-fiends', 'one', 'lesbian', 'who', 'Ramona', 'being', 'Has-bian', 'only', 'be', 'showered', 'heavy', 'coinage', 'battle', 'Scott', 'own', 'demons', 'it.Here', 'see', 'least', 'teens', 'twentysomethings', 'deep', 'metaphysical', 'psychological', 'truths', 'coated', 'video-game', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'candy', 'Not', 'bad', 'trick', 'really', 'religious', 'teachers', 'have', 'been', 'seeking', 'alchemical', 'formula', 'millennia', 'stand', 'accused', 'Director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'did', 'well', 'hope', 'start', 'great', 'career', 'weird', 'English', 'director.This', 'film', 'brought', 'back', 'lovely', 'memories', 'what', 'be', '20', 'oh', 'why', 'go', 'made', 'laugh', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'thought', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'reminded', 'Michael', 'Archangel', 'suspect', 'was', 'unintentional', 'director', 'part', 'have', 'mild', 'crushes', 'Cera', 'one', 'Kieran', 'pretty', 'darned', 'good', 'too', 'like', 'same', 'nonchalant', 'attitude', 'gay', 'community', 'here', 'attitude', 'mystical', 'video', 'superpowers', 'possessed', 'Scott', 'Ramona', 'Knives', 'adorable', 'Ellen', 'Wong', '.Some', 'great', 'work', 'overlooked', 'fans', 'One', 'blow-you-away', 'soundtrack', 'secondly', 'SCOTT', 'one', 'best', 'adaptations', 'ever', 'Not', 'what', 'think', 'old', 'corny', 'Chinese', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'been', 'adapted', 'so', 'beautifully', 'perfectly', 'shaped', 'white', 'culture', 'one', 'scene', 'Knives', 'points', 'menacingly', 'Ramona', ""'ll"", 'destroy', 'broke', 'heart', 'one', 'who', 'broke', 'mine', 'Somehow', 'expected', 'dialogue', 'be', 'sync', 'actors', 'lips', 'Hilarious.I', 'suspect', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'again', 'someone', 'continue', 'button', 'countdown', 'ends.Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'up', 'satanic', 'superproducer', 'Gideon', 'Graves', 'eternally', 'doofy', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'maybe', 'just', 'nod', 'THE', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'PARADISE', 'Also', 'hard', 'believe', 'George', 'Lucas', 'did', ""n't"", 'sue', 'guys', 'copying', 'lightsabers', 'oh', 'well', 'thing', 'FUN', 'FUNNY', 'totally', 'umm', 'worth', 'stuff']",N/A
1348592,A3RU2P4FAACQ1J,B003L20IE2,"Elton Pinto ""Eptiger""","[112, 143]","NOTE: This is just reviewing the theatrical release, not the DVD or Blu-ray.It was with very little fanfare that I went to see Scott Pilgrim vs. the World  on opening night. The ads were never really appealing to me and I felt like Michael Cera was being typecast so I figured this movie would be a flop. Still, there was enough positive buzz that I agreed to come along when a friend wanted to go and I'm floored at how opposite of a reaction I had to this film. Not only is it probably the biggest surprises of my life as far as movies go (not plot-wise, just in my feelings about it), but it's hands down one of the most fun experiences I've ever had in a movie theater.The plot of Scott Pilgrim is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from the trailers: Michael Cera is Scott Pilgrim, who has fallen in love with a very alluring girl who, as it so happens, has 7 evil exes who have banded together to ensure that no one dates her if they can't. You really have to go into the movie accepting that this is the plot because it's not anything deeper than that, and that's a big part of what I love about it. This is one of the few movies I've seen in a long while that understands exactly what it needs to do and really nails it. It focuses on a few things and blows them out of the park. So even though the romance story is never fully fleshed out, it's the first movie I've seen that has felt like a comic book and a video game have come to life, slept together, and produced a child on the big screen.I don't know how true it is to the comic book, but that's irrelevant because it stands on its own as something really smart if you can appreciate the references and things it tries to parody. You don't have to be a gamer or a comic book fan to enjoy the film, you're just guaranteed to love it if you are either. I never thought I'd see a movie that got so many things right about video games - everything from nonsensical fights to collecting coins where it doesn't make sense to a ton of subtle things that are just elegantly done. It's either subtle or obviously over-the-top, it never beats a joke to death. I laughed a lot - from even before the movie formally started - but I also saw very few promotional materials.Aside from those facets, the music is perfect for the movie. I almost felt like it had as much music as a musical without the baggage that would entail. The cast really contributing to pulling off the music though. I believed in them in their roles, as crazy as the world they lived in ended up being. I believed their passion for their music, and that was a cool feeling. The way they weaved music into the storyline was truly clever.I can't leave out how much heart this movie had either. I don't mean gushy have-a-good-cry heart, I just mean that it actually makes you feel good to be a nerd if you're a nerd. It makes you want to go out and jam out on your guitar or play Street Fighter or something - I just felt pumped and enamored with how much the director seemed to love music and video games and comics.Unfortunately, I don't think this is a movie everyone will love. I can't imagine anyone hating it because it just makes you feel so good walking out of it, but I can see parts of it being harder to appreciate without being in your 20s or early 30s. It is somewhat of a niche movie, but I wouldn't be ashamed to show it to anyone (assuming they're at least a teenager). I will say that the writing is weak at times. Even though I did identify somewhat with the romance, it was still at times handled a little strangely. I can see people taking issue with the characters, but I actually liked how non-traditional they were. They weren't people you could totally peg down, but in a good way. One minor gripe I had was that the ending was possibly a little more drawn out than it needed to be, but I didn't really mind that much.This movie is easily an A+ to me, and I urge you to please go and see it. It's only done like $10 million and I think it'll make it up over the course of its run in theaters and on home video, but I feel bad that the makers may not feel the love from the box office that I felt for this movie. I feel silly having had such a strong positive reaction to a romantic comedy action movie that appeals to the 12-year-old inside of me, but I can't lie: I enjoyed this film and can't wait to get it on Blu-ray.",5,Best Comic Movie Ever,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,4369,"['NOTE', 'just', 'reviewing', 'theatrical', 'release', 'not', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray.It', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'fanfare', 'went', 'see', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'opening', 'night', 'ads', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'appealing', 'felt', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'was', 'being', 'figured', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'flop', 'Still', 'was', 'enough', 'positive', 'buzz', 'agreed', 'come', 'along', 'when', 'friend', 'wanted', 'go', ""'m"", 'floored', 'how', 'opposite', 'reaction', 'had', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'probably', 'biggest', 'surprises', 'life', 'as', 'far', 'movies', 'go', 'not', 'plot-wise', 'just', 'feelings', 'hands', 'down', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'movie', 'theater.The', 'plot', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'trailers', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'very', 'alluring', 'girl', 'who', 'so', '7', 'evil', 'exes', 'who', 'have', 'banded', 'together', 'ensure', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'go', 'movie', 'accepting', 'plot', 'not', 'anything', 'deeper', 'big', 'part', 'what', 'love', 'one', 'few', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'really', 'few', 'things', 'park', 'So', 'even', 'romance', 'story', 'never', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'felt', 'comic', 'book', 'video', 'game', 'have', 'come', 'life', 'slept', 'together', 'produced', 'child', 'big', 'screen.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'irrelevant', 'own', 'something', 'really', 'smart', 'can', 'appreciate', 'references', 'things', 'parody', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'gamer', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'film', ""'re"", 'just', 'guaranteed', 'love', 'are', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'see', 'movie', 'got', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'right', 'video', 'games', 'everything', 'nonsensical', 'fights', 'collecting', 'coins', 'where', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'ton', 'subtle', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'elegantly', 'done', 'subtle', 'obviously', 'over-the-top', 'never', 'joke', 'death', 'laughed', 'lot', 'even', 'movie', 'formally', 'started', 'also', 'saw', 'very', 'few', 'promotional', 'materials.Aside', 'facets', 'music', 'perfect', 'movie', 'almost', 'felt', 'had', 'much', 'music', 'musical', 'baggage', 'would', 'entail', 'cast', 'really', 'contributing', 'pulling', 'off', 'music', 'believed', 'roles', 'as', 'crazy', 'world', 'lived', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'believed', 'passion', 'music', 'was', 'cool', 'feeling', 'way', 'weaved', 'music', 'storyline', 'was', 'truly', 'clever.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'heart', 'movie', 'had', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'gushy', 'have-a-good-cry', 'heart', 'just', 'mean', 'actually', 'feel', 'good', 'be', 'nerd', ""'re"", 'nerd', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'jam', 'out', 'guitar', 'play', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'something', 'just', 'felt', 'pumped', 'enamored', 'how', 'much', 'director', 'seemed', 'love', 'music', 'video', 'games', 'comics.Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'everyone', 'will', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'hating', 'just', 'feel', 'so', 'good', 'walking', 'can', 'see', 'parts', 'being', 'harder', 'appreciate', 'being', '20s', 'early', '30s', 'somewhat', 'niche', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'ashamed', 'show', 'anyone', 'assuming', ""'re"", 'least', 'teenager', 'will', 'say', 'writing', 'weak', 'times', 'Even', 'did', 'identify', 'somewhat', 'romance', 'was', 'still', 'times', 'handled', 'little', 'strangely', 'can', 'see', 'people', 'taking', 'issue', 'characters', 'actually', 'liked', 'how', 'non-traditional', 'were', 'were', ""n't"", 'people', 'could', 'totally', 'peg', 'down', 'good', 'way', 'One', 'minor', 'gripe', 'had', 'was', 'ending', 'was', 'possibly', 'little', 'more', 'out', 'needed', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'much.This', 'movie', 'easily', 'A+', 'urge', 'please', 'go', 'see', 'only', 'done', '10', 'million', 'think', ""'ll"", 'make', 'up', 'course', 'run', 'theaters', 'home', 'video', 'feel', 'bad', 'makers', 'may', 'not', 'feel', 'love', 'box', 'office', 'felt', 'movie', 'feel', 'silly', 'having', 'had', 'such', 'strong', 'positive', 'reaction', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'action', 'movie', 'appeals', '12-year-old', 'inside', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lie', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'Blu-ray']",N/A

1348596,A1X01SYFP2EN1W,B003L20IE2,"Evan W. Jenkins ""AuspexAO""","[5, 7]","There are only so many things you can say about how great this movie is. Let's just break it down simple-like:Things that go in your eye holes: Scott Pilgrim VtW was directed by Edgar Wright, a talented bloke who brought us the incredible ""Spaced,"" ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and ""Hot Fuzz."" For a guy who is known as a comedy director he has an uncanny eye for making action scenes memorable (see Hot Fuzz...now) and is one of the few directors I know that can actually tell a joke WITH the camera. He shares this quality with the writer of Scott Pilgrim, Bryan Lee O'Malley, who also toys with his medium to create a sense of irony and rapid-fire pop-culture references. What makes Scott Pilgrim work is that the movie manages to stay faithful to the source material when it makes sense to the flow of the film, and diverge when it needs to. It feels like a collaboration between Wright and O'Malley (although I don't know if that's even the case) rather than a ham-fisted remake. Character design is top-notch. You wouldn't think costumes and hair would be something a fan would focus on, but, in the Scott Pilgrim universe, function follows form.Things that go in your ears holes: The soundtrack and score are beyond description. The best thing you can do is listen to some samples. Obviously, musical taste is pretty subjective, but the music definitely fits the movie. Even if you don't enjoy the genres represented, I doubt you'll find fault with their integration into the film.Things that go in your brain hole(?): Hilarious and well-acted, Scott Pilgrim will undoubtably become a cult classic. The characters in Scott Pilgrim are definitely archetypical so they could easily become two-dimensional if the actors didn't really embrace their unique personalities. Cera IS Scott Pilgrim. He plays him with the same naive and likeable charm that has served him well in the past, but unleashes his inner badass when it is required. However, Kieran Culkin deserves MVP for nailing the iconic Wallace. Not to take away from the other actors who made their crazy, manic characters into ""real"" people for the fans.

1348598,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B003L20IE2,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[1, 1]","One of the positives of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is simply that it is different and original. With so many blah movies that try to be trendy, especially with the ""heartbroken"" kid trying to find love, at least this film takes the ""finding love"" concept in an interesting and original way: using a graphic novel format. While the characters might be flimsy in depth, and the plot a little simplistic, this film is a nice change to a market of moviemaking that mostly fails to take any chances any more. It has some charm, plenty of wit, great sense of humor (in a funny-enough-to-laugh-at-itself kind of way), great music, plenty of visuals, and a message (although you really have to wait to find out what it is). It doesn't take itself too seriously, but relishes the idea of bringing one slacker's quest to find love in a unique way: part video game, part film.Based on the graphic novel, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World centers on the story of Scott Pilgrim's quest to find love. His major problem is that he is fairly clueless about it. Scott (Michael Cera) is infatuated with the idea of seeing and dating the beautiful and mysterious Ramona.  However, to do this, he must defeat Ramona's seven evil exes, a league of obnoxious ex-boyfriends. Thrust into each battle, which is similar to a life-like video game, he has to try to find a way to outsmart or outwit the ex and pass to the next round. Along the way, he learns that Ramona has plenty of baggage in her past. He also learns that he hasn't been the best person, but it takes dealing with the exes to realize this. Earning self respect is the bigger quest of Scott Pilgrim, not finding love.While I enjoyed the film generally, there were some problems. For one, Michael Cera has a way of grating on the nerves. He is the one-trick pony of the geeky, whiny, wimpy slacker-type hopeless romantic, which it seems he plays in every single film. Although Cera had many of the character traits for this character, and although I'm the type that loves to root for underdog types, I just thought it might have been better cast (although no alternative come to mind). Another problem was simply that there is a superficial level to the characters, mainly because of the way the story is presented, with quickly moving scenes jumping around.Still, the film has great entertainment value. It has a way of taking jabs at political correctness and pop culture and has nonstop quips by characters, especially during the fight scenes. It has enough wit to keep you entertained, some rocking music to enjoy, and really brings a fun approach to the graphic novel turned film genre. Kudos to the director for this film's sheer inventiveness. I don't think the film is all bells and whistles though, all entertainment; Pilgrim has to learn some lessons about how to not act to others.Great film, awesome extras.

Ineffably nerdy Scott Pilgrim discovers the 'girl he dreamed about' - justifying his precipitous dumpification of his inappropriately young high-school idolatress - but quickly learns that he needs to defeat all seven of her increasingly bizarre ex-boyfriends in mortal combat. Needless to say, he succeeds.The combat sequences are simulations of popular video games, complete with scores and play-agains. I suspect that there are multiple allusions to specific popular games, but I can't be sure since I've never played a video game in my life. To my mind, gaming has been all downhill since ""Whack-a-Mole."" But it doesn't take a PhD in game theory from the University of Chicago to catch the drift here; Scott Pilgrim is a fantasy surrogate for all the couch-bound thumb athletes of his generation. The curious thing is that my son is no more attracted to gaming than I am; he's a quick-footed second-baseman and an acrobat studying at the National Circus School of Canada. I can't help thinking he set me up to watch this film as a test of my cultural tolerance, especially since he himself fell asleep halfway through it.It's campy and sappy, obviously aspiring to cult status alongside The Rocky Horror Picture Show or Napoleon Dynamite.

1348604,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003L20IE2,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","If you're scratching your dome at how funky weird SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD is going down, it's only that the flick is staying true to the offbeat tone and manga sensibilities of Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novels. Truthfully, it took me a bit of time to acclimate to the low-keyed Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim because he certainly wasn't whom I pictured when it came to casting (I thought it'd be someone more exuberant). But once I did, I hunkered down and soaked in the film's singular flavor. To say that this film oozes the quirk is like saying that Ramona Flowers has boyfriend issues.Scott Pilgrim inhabits a mysterious land called Toronto, Canada. There, Scott spends his time being 22 years old, slacking off, and playing bass guitar for the grunge garage band, Sex Bob-omb. He's currently dating a 17-year-old high schooler named Knives Chau, but it's a tepid, platonic romance and destined to fizzle. Scott Pilgrim soon enough meets the girl of his dreams, and that is literally. Her name is Ramona Flowers and she runs the gamut of interesting alternative hair dyes. Ramona is American and a courier and she makes regular use of the sub-space highway (so she's very dependable and rapid in her gig). Scott is smitten, stalks her a little bit, orders a package just so that Ramona would deliver it to his crib. He pesters her until she agrees to hang out. This is what's known in Toronto as ""courtship.""Love blossoms. Or, anyway, something blossoms. But Ramona discloses a caveat to Scott. For them to date, Scott would have to defeat Ramona's seven evil ex-boyfriends (er, seven evil exes; it's a thing). Love hurts, again literally. As Ramona remarks: ""No break-up is painless. Somebody always gets hurt."" There's probably some metaphor involved. All the awesome fighty fights take place in the backdrop of Sex Bob-omb's competing in a battle of the bands (""We are Sex Bob-omb and we're here to make you think about death and get sad and stuff."").Life-long comic book nerd that I am, I really enjoyed this movie, but I'm not sure about the general public. SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD will ruffle some feathers in terms of how unorthodox it is cinematically, how eccentric it is. Scott Pilgrim, like Dave Lizewski, isn't mainstream like Iron Man or Batman. Thing is, the film keeps faith with its source origin and with its comic book fans. I guess the graphic novels generated enough buzz that a motion picture was felt warranted. But I don't know that a lot of people knew about Scott Pilgrim, going into this movie.The uninitiated are in for a rash of unexpectedness. Text graphics pop up without remorse, detailing the various characters' age and awesomeness rating and so forth. You can read the sound effects ala Adam West's Batman tv series. There are occasional forays thru the sub-space door. Magic exists, as does the Vegan league which bestows super-powers upon its members (there is also the Vegan police). The seven evil exes are all formidable and can kick serious tuchis, even the bi-furious teleporting ex. But, oddly enough, so can Scott Pilgrim. Much like in the comics, nothing about Scott Pilgrim prepares you for when he finally springs into action and goes all martial arts superhero-y (you simply don't expect that from Michael Cera). It's sort of a highlight, and the lack of explanation adds to the charm. Ramona becomes even more hot when she later throws down with an ex and breaks out a honking huge hammer. For the touchy-feely types, this movie even suggests some things about relationships among the twenty-somethings via story devices such as video game allegories and that metaphor of break-ups and fighty fights. If I had my own personal text caption, it would read as having given SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD a rating of ""Awesome!"" Oh, and the indie-rock stuff is pretty ki(kass, too.The DVD's nifty special features: 21 deleted scenes, including an alternate ending in which Scott gets the other girl (totals 00:27:23 minutes and with optional Director's commentary); an option to watch the film with a running trivia track; a plentitude of audio commentary tracks, four of them, in fact: 1) with Director/Co-Writer Edgar Wright & Co-Writer Michael Bacall and author Bryan Lee O'Malley; 2) with actors Michael Cera, Jason Schwartzman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ellen Wong, and Brandon Routh; 3) with more actors Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza, Kieran Culkin, and Mark Webber; and 4) technical commentary with Edgar Wright and Director of Photography Bill Pope; Scott Pilgrim vs. the Bloopers (00:09:39); a whaleload of photo and poster galleries, storyboards, conceptual art, and even a graphic novel comparison gallery; and production crew credits (just a listing of names).",5,"""He punched the highlights out of her

1348616,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B003L20IE2,Jason Bean,"[0, 0]","Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a very fun movie to watch. I'm a big fan of Bryan Lee O.Malley's original comic and while there are a bunch of changes from the source material (they started filming half-way through the comic run), director Edgar Wright (of tv's excellent 'Spaced') manages to capture a lot of it's original charm. Unfortunatly as a film some of this material doesn't hold together as well as it should.The Story of 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' revolves around title character Scott, a slacker in his early twenties who's dating 17 year old Knives Chau and ends up falling in love with Ramona Flowers (who's closer to his own age). Ramona however comes with baggage: seven evil ex's who Scott has to defeat if he wants to date her. The movie itself plays out in a sort of video game styled world with levels, character stats and warp zones. To defeat Ramona's ex's Scott actually fights them hand-to-hand in a fighting game style fashion and wins coins and levels for each one defeated. While it's never clear if this is all happening inside Scott's head or this is some weird video game world these characters inhabit it all plays out in a way that's easy to follow. Unfortunatly this gimmick does wear out it's welcome as fights become more and more repentative (with the exception of the Katayanagi twins which plays out amid a battle of the bands as a giant monster fight) and the movie stops being engaging. Also a lot of the development of the side characters is dumbed down to cheap jokes (Wallace's sleeping around, Kim's passive aggressivness towards Scott, Neil's self-acceptance).While the film does start to slowly loose it's steam, the likability of the cast really keeps most of it afloat. Michael Cera gives his usual uncomfortable twist on Scott Pilgrim, and while he and Mary Winstead (as Ramona) have zero chemistry they remain likeable and watchable. The other actor's are also very well chosen but it's really Ellen Wong as Knives and Kieran Culkin as Scott's witty roommate Wallace who steal the show. The more well-known actors playing the ex's are a lot of fun expecially Chris Evans and Brandon Routh, but again despite some back-story are more or less given 'cameo' roles than actual characters.Your liking to 'Scott Pilgrim versus The World' will no doubt depend on your liking and familiarity to video games and comic books. I think the movie is a lot of fun and being a video game fan and fan of the orignal comic I had to give this film four stars (though I know it probably only deserves three).",4,Fun for the most part.....,1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,2541,"['Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'vs', 'World', 'very', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Bryan', 'Lee', 'O.Malley', 'original', 'comic', 'are', 'bunch', 'changes', 'source', 'material', 'started', 'filming', 'half-way', 'comic', 'run', 'director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'tv', 'excellent', ""'Spaced"", 'manages', 'capture', 'lot', 'original', 'charm', 'Unfortunatly', 'film', 'material', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'Story', ""'Scott"", 'Pilgrim', 'vs', 'World', 'revolves', 'title', 'character', 'Scott', 'slacker', 'early', 'twenties', 'who', 'dating', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Knives', 'Chau', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'Ramona', 'Flowers', 'who', 'closer', 'own', 'age', 'Ramona', 'however', 'baggage', 'seven', 'evil', 'ex', 'who', 'Scott', 'defeat', 'date', 'movie', 'out', 'sort', 'video', 'game', 'styled', 'world', 'levels', 'character', 'stats', 'warp', 'zones', 'defeat', 'Ramona', 'ex', 'Scott', 'actually', 'hand-to-hand', 'fighting', 'game', 'style', 'fashion', 'wins', 'coins', 'levels', 'one', 'defeated', 'never', 'clear', 'happening', 'Scott', 'head', 'weird', 'video', 'game', 'world', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'out', 'way', 'easy', 'follow', 'Unfortunatly', 'gimmick', 'wear', 'welcome', 'fights', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'repentative', 'exception', 'Katayanagi', 'twins', 'out', 'battle', 'bands', 'giant', 'monster', 'fight', 'movie', 'being', 'engaging', 'Also', 'lot', 'development', 'side', 'characters', 'dumbed', 'cheap', 'jokes', 'Wallace', 'sleeping', 'around', 'Kim', 'passive', 'aggressivness', 'towards', 'Scott', 'Neil', 'self-acceptance', 'film', 'start', 'slowly', 'loose', 'steam', 'likability', 'cast', 'really', 'most', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'usual', 'uncomfortable', 'twist', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'Mary', 'Winstead', 'Ramona', 'have', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'remain', 'likeable', 'watchable', 'other', 'actor', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'chosen', 'really', 'Ellen', 'Wong', 'Knives', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'Scott', 'witty', 'roommate', 'Wallace', 'who', 'steal', 'show', 'more', 'well-known', 'actors', 'playing', 'ex', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'expecially', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'again', 'back-story', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'given', ""'cameo"", 'roles', 'actual', 'characters.Your', 'liking', ""'Scott"", 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'will', 'doubt', 'depend', 'liking', 'familiarity', 'video', 'games', 'comic', 'books', 'think', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'being', 'video', 'game', 'fan', 'fan', 'orignal', 'comic', 'had', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'know', 'probably', 'only', 'three']",N/A
1348617,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B003L20IE2,Jason,"[4, 5]","Imagine Yoda in the driver seat of Speed Racer's car, three-toed foot crushing the gas pedal to the floor as he skillfully navigates what amounts to being a Tron maze filled with nostalgic Nintendo video game sound effects.  Window down, left elbow catching a breeze, he's driving with his left knee and having the epic lightsaber battle from Episode III with shotgun riding Darth Sidious while glancing back and forth at the road.  Meanwhile, assorted characters from Mortal Kombat are piled in the backseat like a clown car, fighting alongside an enraged Bruce Leroy from The Last Dragon after he has taken on a final Master level golden glow.  Together, they pummel Mario into submission, tag-teaming him until his bloody carcass excretes golden coins that synchronize perfectly with a bass heavy indie rock produced by Beck (sounds like Leatherface helped with a rusty chainsaw) that is blaring from speakers at jet engine decibels.  That's what I took from Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.  If Comic-Con and Dragon-Con had an omnipotent love child, this movie would have been delivered by all three magi; so, it is quite fitting that the premier was rightfully gifted to attendees of the 2010 Comic-Con.I honestly can't say how much I appreciate this movie.  There are a ton of pop-culture references that any fan of video games, comic books, or graphic novels will thoroughly appreciate.  Seeing as how Scott Pilgrim (Cera), a bassist for aspiring house band Sex Bob-omb, must fight his way through 7 evil exes to date his punkish dream girl Ramona Flowers (Mary Winstead), it comes as no surprise that the action is nearly non-stop, and drowns out the underlying, underdeveloped love triangle about which Pilgrim incessantly whines.  Fighting the exes in a world comparable to a punk rocker's acid trip, Cera and his combatants are accompanied by brilliant usage of onomatopoeia so familiar to comic book fans.  This is not the ""POW!"" and ""BIFF!"" of your father's Batman.  I'm sure this will become a cult hit, and with each successive viewing there will be more to appreciate.It is my honest belief that this movie would have been a massive success, and would have spread like word-of-mouth wildfire, if it hadn't already been DOA at the box office morgue the minute Michael Cera was cast as lead.  Despite the appearances from Chris Evans, Thomas Jane, and Clifton Collins, the overly feminine, indecisive, mumbling angst of a pseudo-teen still manages top billing, even though Cera's stylings are unequivocally unappealing to most.  Grow a spine already!  Beyond typecast, he's run completely out of steam; maybe type-gassed is a better description.  Only Thomas Sangster grates my nerves more as an actor, and I'm pretty much protesting all of their movies until I find out from a reliable source that the sum is greater than the parts (I reserve the right to contradict myself if either ends up as a supporting actor in a Hostel or Saw sequel).  Having said that, I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome of the film.Despite the fact that going in, all viewers were aware of 7 exes, at no time does it feel like a countdown.  There are distractions aplenty, with health bars, social references, enemies exploding into coins, incredibly well done special effects, and hilarious quips from Scott's gay roommate Kieran Culkin - who fills some of the void left by the two vacuous and uncharismatic leads.  Perfected as comic books come to life, the action/fights are outstanding.  The screenplay by Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright is borderline genius, and except for the sometimes lame dialogue - hard to blame them considering the source material and the actors' styles - there isn't a boring moment.  Additional credit goes to Wright for taking on the direction of this film as well.Before this film, I would have thought it impossible to headline a movie with Cera - who is still riding the lottery wave from Superbad - without his mannerisms ruining everything.  Instead, this endearing mash-up is a perfectly delivered display of American youth zeitgeist, a palatable romcom masked by life inside Street Fighter II on Super Nintendo.

1348632,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003L20IE2,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","I'll admit that the first time I watched Scott Pilgrim I didn't entirely buy into the hype. I liked the film, but a lot of people have had such great affection for this movie I didn't really see what the big deal was. Watching the film a second time, I was astounded by how much I liked it. If another more inventive film was released in 2010, I didn't see it.The story is based on a graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley, but I've never read or even seen a physical copy of this series so my review for the film is based on the film's own merit.The film takes place in Toronto, Canada where Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), a 22-year-old, plays bass in a band called Sex-Bob-omb, lives with a gay roommate (Kieran Culkin), and is dating a 17-year-old high school girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). After Scott meets the girl of his dreams (literally), American Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whom I found incredibly attractive in this film), everything seems to fall into place. The only problem is, if he wants to date Ramona he must battle and defeat her seven evil exes.Much of the cast is filled with familiar faces including Brandon Routh, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick, and the terrific Jason Schwartzman and all the actors within seem to be having a lot of fun. It's true that Michael Cera is basically playing the character we are accustomed to seeing him play, yet he fits this role perfectly. I can't imagine an actor more perfect to portray Scott Pilgrim.Now, a lot of people take certain movies too seriously. They can suspend their disbelief for a movie like Transformers, but when they're watching a film that begins as a highly-stylized romance and suddenly turns into a cinematic video-game, they have issues accepting it. I admit that this is not a movie for everyone, but those who call it ""stupid"" simply don't ""get it."" That's not to say you don't ""get it"" if you just don't like the film, but no one can dispute that this is an intelligent, well-rendered film. With that said, I am 18-years-old and while watching the film I wondered if it would or could be enjoyed and appreciated by someone much older than myself. The creative elements throughout the film (even much of the dialogue) are representative of the years I grew up in and on many people of my generation. While no one can really say until years from now, I think that, in a way, Scott Pilgrim may be more of a ""generation-defining"" film than The Social Network.Edgar Wright co-wrote the screenplay with Michael Bacall and I was surprised by how well-written the film is. To a lot of people, Scott Pilgrim functions most noticeably on a visual level but the writing is both fun and energetic. The humor will definitely only appeal to certain tastes, but I found it quite witty. The dialogue is written in a quirky, witty highly-stylized (a description that can be used to describe most everything about this film) lingo that, while memorable, doesn't become an annoyance as it did in Juno. The writing is really the heart of the story for in-between the extravagant action sequences, there's a nice love story with likable characters.What elevates this material significantly is the creative vision of director Edgar Wright. Not being a reader of comics or a player of video games, I may be a little out of my element here but, I don't believe another director has come closer to bringing both a comic book and a video game to the screen than Wright has with this film. The battle scenes are literally a video game put to film, with Scott even picking up tokens after defeating Ramona's exes. While I'm not a gamer, I recognized many of the video game references and there are many of them, with even the Universal logo being one. The way Wright chooses to film the smallest things, like the unique look of Sex-Bob-omb playing, is delightfully clever. It's clear that Wright put every ounce of creative energy he had into creating this world and I can't imagine another director pulling it off as flawlessly as he does. It's too early to call the film innovative, but I've never seen anything like it. While marketing has made it look like a teen action-comedy, Scott Pilgrim is a highly artistic film with vibrant imagery and boundless energy. Even the soundtrack, fashioned by Nigel Goodrich, is energetic (there's that word again) and atmospheric while not being something I generally listen to.Scott Pilgrim is not an intellectual film, but it is a high-minded one. While I don't know if it's a comment on the videogame/hipster subculture, a satire of various trends, a homage to those trends, or a combination of everything I do recognize it as a terrific skewering of pop culture. Whatever the case, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the most inventive, original film of 2010 that I enjoyed and appreciated even more the second time around. While it was not a box office success, it's already gathered a substantial fanbase and I predict this film will become a certifiable cult classic with the appreciation, love, and respect for it only growing as the years pass by.GRADE: A-",5,"The Most Inventive, Original Film of 2010",1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,5077,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'did',

THE WORLD, and it's so bad that it's in Airbender territory.First, let me tell you the premise of SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD. For me to do this is a great kindness since you have to wait more than half an hour for the movie to hint at it and almost a full hour to get a fuller description. Even then, you have to wait until the very end to be told why any of it is happening at all. But to the point - Scott Pilgrim has fallen for a girl, but to be with her, he has to fight seven of her previous boy/girl friends in real life parodies of arcade parodies of movie parodies of real life martial arts duels. Need I say more? I struggled through the mind-numbing tedium with my tween-aged daughter who had wanted to see this flick. But after the first hour, even she wanted me to hit the FF button.The performances in SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD are all okay, except for Johnny One-Note Michael Cera. He plays the same character in every movie and I'm bored with it. It's not like he's Sean Connery, who can get away with it. Worse, he reminds me here of Aaron Johnson's character in Kick-Ass. Ack! Now I'm comparing those two movies. Double Ack! They're both really bad! Ahhh!!! My brain!Wow. That was close. I did trip on over to Rotten Tomatoes to see what the consensus over there was, and I was stunned to find that a great majority of reviewers and normal folks liked SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD. So what am I missing? It's got good production values, the music is fine for what it is, and the actors can act (mostly), but I expect all of that from any movie. The plot is ethereal and meandering, and most of the characters are one-dimensional. But the worse sin of all is that it is boring. How do you recover from that? For me, SCOTT PILGRIM VS.

Blackwelder,"[1, 2]","I almost didn't see this movie, because I don't like Michael Cera, whom I find 100% charisma-free.My friends made me watch it, though, and I am so glad they did, because I think it's the most enjoyable comedy I've seen in years.  I'm pretty sure I laughed more during this movie than at any movie I've ever seen, and I'm not being hyperbolic.  The script for this film is truly clever, and the actors deliver the lines flawlessly.  The characters really are very likable, and -- whatever fun, goofy effects the film may use -- THAT is what engages the viewer.I'll come clean here and confess to being right in the middle of this film's target demographic: I'm a gamer, a comics reader, and a big fan of Asian martial arts movies.  That last element is key, because that's where the plot structure comes from.Scott Pilgrim combines the best of cinema and comic books and gives us something that's more fun than either.  This technique isn't entirely new; Natural Born Killers did something similar, but Scott Pilgrim vs. the World really hits the nail on the head in a way that that other movie does not.Among its many great successes, this film really does a good job of evoking the college experience.  I could relate to the protagonist's not-entirely-ideal living situation, as well as the challenges he's facing in the dating arena, and it's that commonality that helps pull the viewer into the film and once the wacky video game/comic book/wuxia sequences start kicking in, this film is everything I could want from a fun, geeky comedy.  It's clever, brilliant, witty and fun, and there's enough going on that it bears repeated viewing.While I still don't like Michael Cera, and I can't see a guy THAT lame having a chance with a chick THAT hot, that's the film's only weak point, and every other element of this film succeeds so wildly that I can easily overlook that one flaw and wholeheartedly give Scott Pilgrim vs. the World five stars.

1348645,A356RFKNIG043B,B003L20IE2,K. Swanson,"[3, 4]","Easily the best film surprise of 2010 for me was Scott Pilgrim. I knew nothing of it going in, never heard of the comic let alone read it, and knew only Cera and Schwartzman. Which is perfect, as this movie just blew me out of my seat from moment one and never let up.Pilgrim is one of the most successful hyper-modern films I've seen, in terms of its incredibly fast, bright visual sense, and quick cuts that linger just long enough to let your brain grasp what's there but not quite process it fully. It's how video game players see life, and that connection is played to the hilt here, with so many vid game tropes milked for all they're worth. Yet for me it all coalesced into a thrilling ride through the worlds of some extremely brilliant minds.Director Edgar Wright has created the new touchstone for meta-cinema here, to my eyes, and I'd love it if most films were this smart and sly and self-mocking. There's so much going on in this film it's hard to describe; suffice to say that there's a laugh a minute and at least two nice visual puns in the same time. There's a loving retro vibe that's both uber-ironic and heartfelt, and if you lived through the 80s and played some of the old arcade games, there'll be some nice quirky reminders for you tucked amongst the acton.There's also a couple of quick little nods to Seinfeld, its music as well as Larry David's rule for the show, mocked here by Schwartzman: ""No hugging, no learning."" But this film takes Seinfeld's intellectual slapstick and ratchets it up at least a couple notches.I liked the script, and wish there'd been a movie this hip when I was a kid! Then again, we had a few...but nothing this non-stop cool yet geeked out at the same time. So many flicks aimed at a young market pander or are just plain cheese, but SP stays far above all of that, delivering its own reality for 110 minutes with nary a groan-worthy scene.To me this film felt as fresh on first viewing as did Fight Club and The Matrix in their day, high praise indeed.Cera takes his nerdy thang to its ultimate heights; I thought he was both convincing and funny here, as is everyone, Weathers and Schwartzman and Wong especially.The music is often excellent, not just a satire but a good tribute to emo and alt-rock cliches, on the quality level of Spinal Tap (more high praise). It didn't surprise me to hear that Beck wrote many of the tunes; they're that good. His version of Ramona at the end of the credits is well worth hearing a few times, very haunting like some of his fabulous Mutations album, and his punky romps are hilarious and also musically interesting, no mean feat.Plus which, grand slam, the blu-ray is exemplary, full of bloopers and various docs and music shorts and just way more than usual, and way better.

1348651,A1R17YELPTSM5T,B003L20IE2,MacJunegrand,"[1, 2]","I'm going to get this out of the way first: I absolutely LOVE the Scott Pilgrim comic books.  I think they're great, they're different, they do a great job of making interesting characters, interesting dialogue, a novel premise and fun situations showcased with simple, minimalistic yet perfectly fitting artwork.The gist of the story is this: Scott Pilgrim is a teenager entering adulthood.  He has a band, lives with a friend (who's gay) and has a girlfriend who still goes to high school.  He then meets Ramona Flowers, literally the girl of his dreams, and falls for her.  The problem is, Ramona has seven evil ex boyfriends, and Scott has to defeat them if he intends to go out with her.  The premise sounds quite ridiculous, and, to be fair, it is, but it's not really bad.  And, of course, it's quite original.  The comics do a good job of pretending to be just this story about normal teens up until the point in which the exes are revealed, and it feels both fresh and exciting.But the movie... I just... can't... I didn't even watch the entire thing.  I had to stop it at little more than halfway because I was going to fall asleep.  And I don't know what the problem is.  All the elements are there, and for the most part, they remain the same.  Hell, I don't even have the classic ""Oh, it's Michael Cera playing himself again"" complaint, since he's easily the best part of the film.What is it, then?  Is it the fact that they shortened the story too much?  That shouldn't be a problem, since rarely direct adaptations bother me that way.  I had no problem with Jurassic Park, Harry Potter or even Watchmen.  I think the problem is that they do the opposite.  They don't take away enough.  Instead of keeping less elements and giving them more time to develop, they keep all the elements and they rush them, which makes the movie feel hyperactive, like it's all the time on fast forward.  I really think the movie is too worried with becoming the cult hit the books are, and it doesn't really finds its own place.Now, taking into account the fact that this movie, while not very successful financially, it's still well regarded, I believe it's pretty obvious that it actually has become quite the cult hit, but it's probably not for the reasons the filmmakers were expecting.  This movie manages to catch a few of the good things from the book: it's fresh, it's different, it has interesting characters, a novel premise and eye-popping visuals.  But the problem, I feel, is that it fails fundamentally in the storytelling sense.I don't know, I was supposed to be the target audience for this film, but I find the excess of action monotonous and boring, if that makes any sense.  I give the movie credit for being different, but I can't help thinking it would have been so much better if they slowed down a little.  Maybe if they had split it in two films instead.  Or if at least they removed the less necessary elements.",2,I... don't... get... it...,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,2932,"[""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'first', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'comic', 'books', 'think', ""'re"", 'great', ""'re"", 'different', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'interesting', 'characters', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'novel', 'premise', 'fun', 'situations', 'showcased', 'simple', 'minimalistic', 'yet', 'perfectly', 'fitting', 'artwork.The', 'gist', 'story', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'teenager', 'entering', 'adulthood', 'band', 'friend', 'who', 'gay', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'then', 'Ramona', 'Flowers', 'literally', 'girl', 'dreams', 'problem', 'Ramona', 'seven', 'evil', 'ex', 'boyfriends', 'Scott', 'defeat', 'go', 'out', 'premise', 'quite', 'ridiculous', 'be', 'fair', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'course', 'quite', 'original', 'comics', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'pretending', 'be', 'just', 'story', 'normal', 'teens', 'up', 'point', 'exes', 'are', 'revealed', 'fresh', 'movie', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'entire', 'thing', 'had', 'stop', 'little', 'more', 'halfway', 'was', 'going', 'fall', 'asleep', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'problem', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'most', 'part', 'remain', 'same', 'Hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'classic', 'Oh', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'playing', 'again', 'complaint', 'easily', 'best', 'part', 'film.What', 'then', 'fact', 'shortened', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'rarely', 'direct', 'adaptations', 'way', 'had', 'problem', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'even', 'Watchmen', 'think', 'problem', 'do', 'opposite', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'enough', 'Instead', 'keeping', 'less', 'elements', 'giving', 'more', 'time', 'develop', 'keep', 'elements', 'rush', 'movie', 'feel', 'hyperactive', 'time', 'fast', 'forward', 'really', 'think', 'movie', 'too', 'worried', 'becoming', 'cult', 'hit', 'books', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'finds', 'own', 'place.Now', 'taking', 'account', 'fact', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'successful', 'financially', 'still', 'well', 'regarded', 'believe', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'actually', 'become', 'quite', 'cult', 'hit', 'probably', 'not', 'reasons', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'expecting', 'movie', 'catch', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'book', 'fresh', 'different', 'interesting', 'characters', 'novel', 'premise', 'eye-popping', 'visuals', 'problem', 'feel', 'fundamentally', 'storytelling', 'sense.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'target', 'audience', 'film', 'find', 'excess', 'action', 'monotonous', 'boring', 'sense', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'being', 'different', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'slowed', 'down', 'little', 'Maybe', 'had', 'split', 'two', 'films', 'instead', 'least', 'removed', 'less', 'necessary', 'elements']",N/A

1348654,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003L20IE2,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","It seems that Hollywood, as always, never quite gets the things they take an option on to make films from. A best selling novel ends up omitting the things people loved about it for the flashier scenes. A TV series has the heart of it tossed aside for the shiny surface of the recognizable characters. And comic books are more often than not done as if the film makers had a fear of making a movie that, well, looks like a comic book. Until recently comic book based films tossed aside all that made them what fans loved and instead turned them into stereotypical films that used the characters names and little more.SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD is not one of those films. Director Edgar Wright, who made SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ, understands what fans of this comic book loved. The quirkiness of the characters, the unimaginable situations and the slam bang fight sequences that comics fans adore. Yes Wright understands these things, gets the fact that comic fans look for them and doses them out slowly but surely here.Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is an early twenties something guitar player in a band that has yet to find success. Having recently found a new girlfriend in high school student Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), things are looking up. The band has an important gig coming up that may land them an actual contract and a chance at being paid. And then Scott sees Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).Quickly dumping Knives, Scott sets his sights on Ramona, attempting to gain her favor. The pair eventually take a liking to one another. But then something odd happens. One of Ramona's ex lovers' shows up and challenges Scott to a duel to the death. For some odd reason, all of Ramona's seven ex lovers must battle anyone who wants to be her new boyfriend, an unfortunate circumstance for Scott.Until this point the movie seems a bit slow, but that's all to set up what follows. We get to know the characters, where they stand in one another's lives and how they fit into the story. Once the ex lovers appear to duke it out with Scott, the film veers quickly into the whole comic book world of ultra violence that never gets much more serious than a Road Runner cartoon. Kicks land people across rooms, into skyscrapers and disappearing. And no one ever questions if this is right or not let alone police showing up to ask what happened. It's accepted as part of the story.As the ex lover count winds down we finally find out the real reason for the battles, just how they began and why Scott must defeat each one if he is to claim the hand of Ramona. It's an interesting journey and one that offers some dynamic visuals and fight sequences. Keep in mind though this isn't a serious film by any means but more of a fun filled adventure with plenty of humor.So is it a good movie? Yes, it is, though as I said you have to give it a bit of time for it all to come together. As it began I found myself thinking oh no, another Michael Cera movie where he's all teen angst and he's a goofy dorky nerd who can't put a sentence together without seeming pathetic. But it isn't that at all. And while I'm not the biggest fan of Cera, he actually does a good job here as does the entire cast.But it's the comic book come to life portion of this movie that makes it worthwhile. Not just in the fact that this world involves seven ex lovers who come back not to reunite with their past girlfriend but to stop her from having someone new in her life, no that's not enough. We even get the chance to have the long loved graphically displayed sound effects projected on screen for us. If ""POW!"" is the word on the page then ""POW!"" actually shows on the screen.I've only read on SCOTT PILGRIM comic and wasn't thrilled with it. I am a fan of Edgar Wright though. And with this film he solidifies his role as one of the better directors that have come along in some time. While this film didn't find the audience that the studio thought it would, it might be one of those films that finds an audience on DVD. If you're looking for something a little different, a little fun and definitely tied to the world of comics, you won't do much better right now than SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD.",4,COMIC MOVIES VS THE WORLD,1291680000,"12 7, 2010",2010,4186,"['Hollywood', 'always', 'never', 'quite', 'things', 'take', 'option', 'make', 'films', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'up', 'omitting', 'things', 'people', 'loved', 'flashier', 'scenes', 'TV', 'series', 'heart', 'tossed', 'aside', 'shiny', 'surface', 'recognizable', 'characters', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'done', 'film', 'makers', 'had', 'fear', 'making', 'movie', 'well', 'comic', 'book', 'recently', 'comic', 'book', 'based', 'films', 'tossed', 'aside', 'made', 'what', 'loved', 'instead', 'turned', 'stereotypical', 'films', 'used', 'characters', 'names', 'little', 'more.SCOTT', 'PILGRIM', 'VS', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'Director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'who', 'made', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'HOT', 'FUZZ', 'what', 'fans', 'comic', 'book', 'loved', 'quirkiness', 'characters', 'unimaginable', 'situations', 'slam', 'bang', 'fight', 'sequences', 'comics', 'fans', 'adore', 'Yes', 'Wright', 'things', 'fact', 'comic', 'fans', 'look', 'doses', 'out', 'slowly', 'surely', 'here.Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'early', 'twenties', 'something', 'guitar', 'player', 'band', 'yet', 'find', 'success', 'Having', 'recently', 'found', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Knives', 'Chau', 'Ellen', 'Wong', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'up', 'band', 'important', 'gig', 'coming', 'up', 'may', 'land', 'actual', 'contract', 'chance', 'being', 'paid', 'then', 'Scott', 'Ramona', 'Flowers', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', '.Quickly', 'dumping', 'Knives', 'Scott', 'sights', 'Ramona', 'attempting', 'gain', 'favor', 'pair', 'eventually', 'take', 'liking', 'one', 'then', 'something', 'odd', 'One', 'Ramona', 'ex', 'lovers', 'shows', 'challenges', 'Scott', 'duel', 'death', 'odd', 'reason', 'Ramona', 'seven', 'ex', 'lovers', 'must', 'battle', 'anyone', 'who', 'be', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'unfortunate', 'circumstance', 'Scott.Until', 'point', 'movie', 'bit', 'slow', 'set', 'up', 'what', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'where', 'stand', 'one', 'lives', 'how', 'fit', 'story', 'ex', 'lovers', 'appear', 'duke', 'out', 'Scott', 'film', 'veers', 'quickly', 'whole', 'comic', 'book', 'world', 'ultra', 'violence', 'never', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'Road', 'Runner', 'cartoon', 'Kicks', 'land', 'people', 'rooms', 'skyscrapers', 'disappearing', 'one', 'ever', 'questions', 'right', 'not', 'let', 'alone', 'police', 'showing', 'up', 'ask', 'what', 'happened', 'accepted', 'part', 'story.As', 'ex', 'lover', 'count', 'down', 'finally', 'find', 'out', 'real', 'reason', 'battles', 'just', 'how', 'began', 'why', 'Scott', 'must', 'defeat', 'one', 'claim', 'hand', 'Ramona', 'interesting', 'journey', 'one', 'dynamic', 'visuals', 'fight', 'sequences', 'Keep', 'mind', ""n't"", 'serious', 'film', 'means', 'more', 'fun', 'filled', 'adventure', 'plenty', 'humor.So', 'good', 'movie', 'Yes', 'said', 'have', 'give', 'bit', 'time', 'come', 'together', 'began', 'found', 'thinking', 'oh', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'movie', 'where', 'teen', 'angst', 'goofy', 'dorky', 'nerd', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'sentence', 'together', 'seeming', 'pathetic', ""n't"", 'that', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Cera', 'actually', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'as', 'entire', 'cast.But', 'comic', 'book', 'come', 'life', 'portion', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'Not', 'just', 'fact', 'world', 'seven', 'ex', 'lovers', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'not', 'reunite', 'past', 'girlfriend', 'stop', 'having', 'someone', 'new', 'life', 'not', 'enough', 'even', 'get', 'chance', 'have', 'long', 'loved', 'graphically', 'displayed', 'sound', 'effects', 'projected', 'screen', 'POW', 'word', 'page', 'then', 'POW', 'actually', 'screen.I', ""'ve"", 'only', 'read', 'SCOTT', 'PILGRIM', 'comic', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'am', 'fan', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'film', 'role', 'one', 'better', 'directors', 'have', 'come', 'time', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'audience', 'studio', 'thought', 'would', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'films', 'audience', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'little', 'fun', 'definitely', 'tied', 'world', 'comics', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'better', 'right', 'now', 'SCOTT', 'PILGRIM', 'VS', 'THE', 'WORLD']",N/A

The bad guys even turn into change when they die...well all except for the main villains but whatever. On top of that it's filled with video game references, over the top bosses with strange super powers that the main hero can't understand...and this all happens while he is doing this in a game but he is oblivious to the fact that his life is like a game. Now that I think more about it I'm surprised Suda51 didn't sue the creators of this movie... too many coincidences. Not to mention ***spoiler here*** the main Villain is also the head of the corporation (well in this movie he's just a successful mogul) that put everything together. Kind of like how Pizza Bat is the end boss and creator of the Assassin tournament and also the head of a large corporation. I guess as I watched this film I couldn't help but think.. wait... wait.. why do I have a feeling I've seen something like this before.Well anyway...This movie was pretty good but it just didn't hit that perfect mark with me like most other reviews I guess. The action was fun, the game references were fine, the band idea and music was fantastic BUT, I think the reason why I didn't like this movie so much was because I didn't think Ramona was anything special or even worth fighting over. There just didn't seem to be any type of chemistry between them other than for whatever reason Scott just decided he wanted a chance at being her boyfriend.For the most part I thought Knives was the better chick and more the GF type worth fighting over. She apparently cared about Scott all Ramona seemed to care about was herself. The ending was almost good until it gave me the finger. Maybe I played to many videogames and it's warped my mind but I don't understand why Scott Pilgrim wanted this average looking chick with colored hair so badly. What about her was so amazing? Her bland personality and loud fashion style? Her screwed up past to match how confused she was about her present self? I don't get it?Scott Pilgrim is such a dorky guy how is he getting these girls anyway? They all seem out of his league and he seems like the type that would be lead around by a leash and get walked on.Just those parts of the movie that didn't leave me raving over me because it didn't seem so realistic. I know that's expecting a lot from a film like this but the characters should at least be believable on that level since this is about romance.I don't think I'd even fight the bus man for Romona let alone 7 people she's not worth it. She kind of reminds me of those women who have like 10 ex boyfriends and have been around the world thrice and they are like 25 and sound like a woman that's 54 with all their baggage. I mean woa! who wants that. I'm looking for something brand new off the lot with low miles (Like Knives) I don't want something that's been worn to hell and doesn't even come with a 3 year warranty.

1348664,A3RFCBJ6U5DLFN,B003L20IE2,MisterMusicFan,"[5, 5]","It's unlikely that there has been or will be a movie in recent years as ruggedly ambitious as `Scott Pilgrim VS. The World.' This movie is a thrilling, hyperactive spectacle from start to finish, and although some critics couldn't seem to handle the ride, it was in theaters and is now on DVD one of the most joyful movie events in several years. I would almost dare to say that not since `Rocky Horror Picture Show' was watching a movie in theaters this much sheer fun.It's a premise many over the age of 25 might crinkle their nose at, but it made for a perfectly functional joyride of a film anyhow: Scott Pilgrim, 22 year-old bass guitarist of the self-stylized band Sex Bob-omb, begins dating 17 year-old Knives Chau, much to his friends' dismay. He soon after becomes infatuated with Ramona Flowers, however, a mysterious young woman he continues to encounter in his dreams. He eventually becomes obsessed with her and is doggedly intent on dating her.When this finally happens to become a reality, Scott is suddenly forewarned that if he wishes to engage in a relationship with Ramona, he must fight to the death with her seven evil exes, a spunky league of men (plus one girl), each with some form of superpower and a major chip on his or her shoulder. And so the battles ensue, each tougher than the last, as Scott fights relentlessly for the prerogative to love Ramona.`Scott Pilgrim' is chock-full of very of-the-moment pop culture references, many of them relating to video games, comics, anime and manga. The film features music from The Legend of Zelda, sound bites from the likes of Super Mario Bros. and Seinfeld, explosive visual effects clearly inspired from some of the brightest, most exciting anime scenes and manga panels, and so much more; the exes even explode into coins when they're defeated. What's particularly impressive is that none of it feels like blatant product placement or pointlessly gimmicky-every last facet somehow manages to weave itself artistically into the film's themes. Despite how crazy this all sounds, there are several key factors that make it work.To begin with, the casting is just about completely seamless; Mary Elizabeth Winstead is deeply emotive as the wistful, bewitching Ramona; the audience is sure to become just as smitten with her as Scott is. Ellen Wong is equally irresistible as the adorably awesome Knives, a character everyone will surely empathize with. Kieran Culkin plays Scott's level-headed, quick-witted gay roommate Wallace; with his hilarious one-liners and general likeability factor, his character is truly one of the greatest pleasures the film has to offer. Other notable castmates are Chris Evans as a hellish he-man evil ex and Anna Kendrick as Scott's sassy sister.Although the casting of Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim doesn't come as a major surprise, one does have to wonder what could've been if the lead role had been in more capable (and less bland) hands. Michael Cera, a whopping 20 films deep into his career, doesn't seem to be particularly capable of playing anyone other than himself; thankfully, however, his character glides on the movie's momentum and nothing, not even his portrayal of Scott, is ever weighted down. You'll find yourself liking Scott despite his character defects and even his true identity as Michael Cera.Based on the 6 comic books of the same name, `Scott Pilgrim' has to cram a lot of content into a 112-minute movie, but the general themes of the comics are sustained, and some of the dialogue is in fact direct excerpts. Book-to-movie transitions are never perfect and will always come with naysayers, but the movie stands so strong on its own that few, even devoted fans of the comics, are likely to complain.This is a movie overflowing with action, excitement, passion, and, shockingly, a great deal of emotion-you'll care about each of these characters, despite the absurdities surrounding them. This is a type of film that strove for a lot of things and achieved all of them-it's very rare that a film can successfully mesh slapstick comedy with action, adventure, drama-and still maintain anything to be taken seriously or sympathize with. `Scott Pilgrim VS. The World' is that film; a surreal fantasy somehow grounded in the real-life hearts and emotions of we human beings.

I expected nothing more than mild entertainment, like my mindset when seeing The Expendables, but I left the theater with a surprise thought in my head. I have seen 28 movies in theaters so far this year, but the one I just walked out of is my second favorite, behind only Inception. I didn't expect that at all. It probably helped that the audience I saw it with was very vocal in the laugh department and that's always a plus when watching a comedy. I can't remember the last time I laughed as much at the movies. The dialogue and editing are very clever, but it's all the visual gags that take it beyond anything I've ever seen. Whether it's all the video game related music and concepts, or the Seinfeld theme, followed by a scene with a laugh track coming out of nowhere, it never stops thinking of new ways to make you smile in awe of it. To make a great thing even better, it also pulls off the action element and a minor romantic angle for the ladies. The fight scenes are creative and unique, and they even found room to throw in a few original rock tunes.I'm not the biggest Michael Cera fan, mainly because he's always acts the same, though I do admit that nobody can play a dork like him. His timing and delivery is excellent and he even had me believing in Michael Cera the action star by the end. This is easily my favorite role of his. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was another bit of perfect casting. She even managed to look good in all three of her crazy hair colors. Kieran Culkin got more than his share of laughs as Cera's gay roommate. All of the other supporting players (Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, Anna Kendrick and Jason Schwartzman being some of the big names) from top to bottom were amazing, without a single weak link.Writer/Director, Edgar Wright, of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz fame, got nearly everything right with this mini-masterpiece. You don't have to be a gamer to enjoy it, but it will sure make you appreciate it that much more. I guess I'm gonna have to make some room in my Blu-ray collection for this baby.",5,"Scott Pilgrim Vs.

He's 22, between jobs and playing bass in a not-so-great band, and he's dating a high schooler.  Sure, her name is Knives Chow, which everyone has to admit is kind of a cool name, and she's got mad skills in the arcade - but they haven't even kissed, and they probably shouldn't, and everyone around him knows this is not really moving on, and it's not fair to the young woman whose heart he is sure to break.  Sure enough, he does decide to move on the moment he sets eyes on the colorful and enigmatic girl of his dreams (who also happens to be around his age): but she's got some serious baggage.  In order to date her, he has to defeat, in arcade game style mortal combat, her seven evil exes (all played with panache by a number of cameo stars).It's like a colorfully stylized musical, except instead of breaking into song when conflicts arise or emotions boil, they break out impossible kungfu moves, complete with colorful Batman-tv-era ""kerplunks"" and ""pows"" written onto the screen.  I read a New York Times review from an unimpressed game critic who seemed to want it to mean something, or to better reflect the reality of contemporary video games.  Maybe it doesn't do those things, but I don't think it needs to.  My wife and I saw it and walked out enchanted and amused.  (My only complaint is that I thought Scott Pilgrim and Knives Chow were in fact a far better match than he and the bright-haired Ramona Flowers.

There is a core of good will, optimism, and, yes, charm that struck me as authentic and this is the only reason that I did not hit ""stop"" after two minutes, as I was sorely tempted to do. I can see why a minority of viewers (majority of Amazion reviewers) really liked this film. But I wish I had gone with instinct and saved two hours. Here's why.  A teeny bit of genuineness is not a reason to make a movie. The gamer schtick (tons of visuals ranging from instant to draggy) was, for me, just a whole lot of frosting. The indie music schtick (and it really is schtick) was similarly insignificant, though pleasant enough. The comic book schtick -- and some of us don't care about how true, to the third decimal place, the film is to the comic -- is truly old hat. In my opinion, the director avoids turning all the characters into really flat ""types"" that we've seen before (the gay friend, the kooky girl, the kookier girl, the cynical musician/adversary, etc.) and I really liked that, but on the downside, none of the characters themselves had any real appeal or depth.

If you liked any or all of those three films you should enjoy ""Scott Pilgrim vs The World"". American audiences have historically been highly resistant to expressionism and it is interesting how that style is now finding an audience in the gamer and comic book crowds, apparently computer generated special effects have effectively kicked down the barriers that have long kept us trapped in the realism style.I came to this film as a fan of Alison Pill and was not disappointed, she appears to be having a lot of fun playing a variation of Mary Stuart Masterson's ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" (1987) character; although Alison gets to deadpan much funnier lines.And Mary Elizabeth Winstead should get some credit for putting herself out there in some unconventional stuff like this and Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" (2007). It is rare for an actress to take these kind of chances but it is a good way to avoid type casting.My only complaint is that much of the $60Million budget does not seem to make it to the screen, the film would probably have worked better as a more minimalist production.  The computer generated stuff simply has no charm and you just want to fast forward through the silly fight sequences.Then again, what do I know?

1348684,A27L5L6I7OSV5B,B003L20IE2,Otto Correct,"[1, 1]","For starters, this film is great, and a breath of fresh air when compared to so much of Hollywood's output these days.  Those of you who like the comic, you should be plenty happy with what you get here, it retains the heart, wit, style, humility and fun of the books.Some folks won't like it (mostly due to its style), and that's fine, this movie won't be for everybody, but the main reason I'm throwing my 2 cents in here is because a lot of these negative reviews are claiming this movie is ""all style, no substace.""That's a completely idiotic and shortsighted statement.The core point of this film, and indeed the entire 6-part comic series as well, is that Scott Pilgrim is NOT a nice guy, turns a blind eye to his faults and double standards, but by the end of his adventure develops some self-awareness and a measure of emotional maturity and self-respect, thereby truly becoming a better person.  Since the movie/comics are played out from his perspective, his crappy behavior isn't always rubbed in the viewer's face, so those who watch movies without *thinking* about them probably missed it.If so, that's too bad, because this movie does a great job at showing how selfish, cowardly behavior can really spread once someones heart gets involved.  Scott doesn't think anyone gets hurt by how he handles breakups, but look at how quickly Knives, formerly sweet and innocent, starts coming on to Young Neil just to make Scott jealous.  Because Scott jerked her around, now she's jerking someone else around, hurting Young Neil in the process.There's other examples, but the whole point is that its good for these themes to be explored in a way that slacker hipster types will actually want to watch, since there are plenty of us out there who could use this message presented to us.  I can look back to times where I did stuff just like Scott, inadvertantly hurting others because it was the easier option for me, and I was the only one I was thinking about at the time.  I know plenty of people out there who *still* act as bad (or worse) as Scott with their romantic relationships, even though they're WAY older than 23.As far as it being ""too hip"" or ""too self-aware"" as others have complained about, you guys all know it was MAKING FUN of hipsters right?  There's tons of biting satire about the indie scene, etc. even though they do right by not making any of it particularly mean-spirited.  If you've ever been in a garage band or went to your friend's crappy basement show or met up with someone you haven't seen in years only to find out they're now ""too cool for school"" even though they haven't really done anything, this movie will resonate.So yeah, this film is highly stylish, but behind the comic book and video game imagery, there's a very human heart beating within.  Sure, some of it might be generational, but if you are part of the generation that had Super Nintendos growing up, chances are you know these people, or, just maybe, you WERE one of them.",5,"""Style over substance""???

I didn't see it in theaters because of that. Well after it stoped playing in theaters I was hearing so much about how ""this is a gamer movie"" and ""there's so many video game jokes"" that I was kicking my self for not seeing it in theaters. So I decided to rent it. As an overview, the trailer was right, it was stupid. For a my more comprehensive review, just google ""Pokematic Scott Pilgram"" and it should be the first result. Self promotion aside, let me get to this amazon review.Let me start out with the story. It was origional, like everyone says. But just because something is origional doesn't mean it's good. Scott is some loser adult who is in a band who's only fan is scott's 10 years younger than him girlfriend, who he dumps for some girl who has 7 evil ex's that he has to fight off. Done properly that might have done well, but it wasn't. It was quite uninteresting.Now for the video game jokes. I heard about them and got the impression that the movie was full of them. Turns out that the ""7 best videogame jokes"" were the ""only video game jokes"" in this insult of a movie. I probably wouldn't mention this aspect if it wasn't made such a big deal, but it was. Nintendo Powers did a one page article on the ""7 best video game jokes"" in scott pilgram. For a non-videogame adaptation movie to make it into nintendo powers is almost unheard of. It was quite a disapointment that that wasn't explored more with the only videogame stuff to really be in the fight scenes.And now for the worst aspect of all, Scott Pilgram himself. I think Scott is suposed to have a story of loser becoming awesome, kind of like the premis of spider man. At the begining we're lead to believe that he's a loser geek guy, and maybe root for him to become awesome. Don't get me wrong, he's a loser, but not the kind that we root for. I actually can't help but root against him because he's such a d***.What could have saved this? If the fight scenes were done in an 8-bit animation style. That would have worked so much better for the crazy fight scenes where the characters score points for every landed blow. But not the story part where all the aunomanapeas from comic books were.

If you want to know what the movie is about, there are plenty of reviews that just outline the story and base their review on their personal feeling about the film. My goal is to explain why this Blu-ray is worth purchasing.Background/Story: I have to admit, this film did not look interesting to me at all. However, I gave it a chance because Edgar Wright is a great director. I begrudgingly rented it so that I could engage in conversations about it since everyone seemed to be talking about it. Boy, did I feel foolish. This is a great movie and one of the few films that I actually felt I needed to own. The story telling is so unique and the actors manage to deliver excellent performances without succumbing to cheap-laughs or outrageous gags. The story is unique and engaging and although it is geared toward the Nintendo generation, this is not a film that only nerds can enjoy.Visuals: The visual elements of this film are where it truly shines. The unique use of visual effects pull the audience into the story, while at the same time providing many laughs. Wright managed to utilize groundbreaking visual effects that complement, rather than distract from the narrative. If for no other reason, this film is worth buying simply because of the subtle visual elements and quips that you will find upon repeat viewing. The Blu-ray version of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World looks spectacular.Audio: In terms of the score, the audio is excellent and well balanced. I have watched this film both on standard TV speakers as well as a high-end Bose system. While there is some obvious ADR, the dialogue is clear and the sound does not max out causing distortion. The music in the film is great as well. Many of the songs are composed and even performed by Beck. Even thought I am not a die-hard fan of his music, it fits well in this movie.Special Features: This section will usually make/break my decision to purchase a film. The special features on the blu-ray version of the film are excellent. There is plenty of content for cine-philes such as myself. If I'm going to purchase a movie, it must 1) be capable of repeat viewing and 2) have special features that enhance the film. There are many behind the scenes features that not only include the standard deleted scenes, gag-real, and alternate footage, but many other interesting featurettes including Behind the scenes, visual effects, making-of, and a look at the music in the film. There is also a feature commentary that really complements the film and gives insight into some of the more subtle elements of film-making. Finally, the version that I have has the U Control option which provides a Picture-in-picture storyboard, as well as the Pocket Blu capabilities.If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you do; you may be pleasantly surprised. If you have seen it and enjoyed it, I highly recommend purchasing this Blu-ray.Final Rating: 9/10",4,Great Movie with Excellent Special Features,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,3040,"['DISCLAIMER', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'write', 'synopsis', 'plot', 'purpose', 'review', 'outline', 'reasons', 'bought', 'film', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'are', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'just', 'outline', 'story', 'base', 'review', 'personal', 'feeling', 'film', 'goal', 'explain', 'why', 'Blu-ray', 'worth', 'purchasing.Background/Story', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'interesting', 'However', 'gave', 'chance', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'great', 'director', 'begrudgingly', 'rented', 'could', 'engage', 'conversations', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'be', 'talking', 'Boy', 'did', 'feel', 'foolish', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'actually', 'felt', 'needed', 'own', 'story', 'telling', 'so', 'unique', 'actors', 'manage', 'deliver', 'excellent', 'performances', 'succumbing', 'cheap-laughs', 'outrageous', 'gags', 'story', 'unique', 'engaging', 'geared', 'Nintendo', 'generation', 'not', 'film', 'only', 'nerds', 'can', 'enjoy.Visuals', 'visual', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'where', 'truly', 'unique', 'use', 'visual', 'effects', 'pull', 'audience', 'story', 'same', 'time', 'providing', 'many', 'laughs', 'Wright', 'managed', 'utilize', 'groundbreaking', 'visual', 'effects', 'complement', 'rather', 'distract', 'narrative', 'other', 'reason', 'film', 'worth', 'buying', 'simply', 'subtle', 'visual', 'elements', 'quips', 'will', 'find', 'upon', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'spectacular.Audio', 'terms', 'score', 'audio', 'excellent', 'well', 'balanced', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'standard', 'TV', 'speakers', 'as', 'well', 'high-end', 'Bose', 'system', 'obvious', 'ADR', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'sound', 'not', 'max', 'out', 'causing', 'distortion', 'music', 'film', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'Many', 'songs', 'are', 'composed', 'even', 'performed', 'Beck', 'Even', 'thought', 'am', 'not', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'music', 'well', 'movie.Special', 'Features', 'section', 'will', 'usually', 'make/break', 'decision', 'purchase', 'film', 'special', 'features', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'film', 'are', 'excellent', 'plenty', 'content', 'cine-philes', 'such', ""'m"", 'going', 'purchase', 'movie', 'must', '1', 'be', 'capable', 'repeat', 'viewing', '2', 'have', 'special', 'features', 'enhance', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'features', 'not', 'only', 'include', 'standard', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag-real', 'alternate', 'footage', 'many', 'other', 'interesting', 'featurettes', 'including', 'scenes', 'visual', 'effects', 'making-of', 'look', 'music', 'film', 'also', 'feature', 'commentary', 'really', 'film', 'insight', 'more', 'subtle', 'elements', 'film-making', 'Finally', 'version', 'have', 'U', 'Control', 'option', 'Picture-in-picture', 'storyboard', 'as', 'well', 'Pocket', 'Blu', 'capabilities.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'suggest', 'do', 'may', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'have', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'highly', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'Blu-ray.Final', 'Rating', '9/10']",N/A

Michael Cera--sort of the poster boy for the ""now"" generation--plays the somewhat clueless & rather beleaguered title character in this often entertaining & mind-blowing fusion between hip romantic comedies & the world of video games. The logistics of the dazzling CGI alone must've been a nightmare for the filmmakers. But the payback is well worth it as our hero--in order to date the girl of his dreams--must defeat her ""seven deadly exes"" amidst visual ""POWS"" & ""WHAMS"" & comic book panel split screens which underscore all the action. Scott Pilgrim is a foolish but likable slacker who expects sympathy over his often broken heart, yet, doesn't seem to notice the hearts HE breaks! And that is the ongoing lesson which Pilgrim--as he racks up points (shown on the screen)--must realize as his ""ultimate goal"".There's so much going on in this film that trying to dissect it would be like writing a book, so I won't even bother. Suffice to say that its creative energy is so awesome that even when segments don't make much sense, it doesn't matter because the movie's quirky, irresistible energy sweeps the viewer right along for the ride.

For those not familiar with the general plot: Scott falls for a cute girl named Ramona, and later learns that he can only date her if he defeats her ""seven evil exes"" in battle.The movie effortlessly and playfully moves between reality, video-game surrealism, dream surrealism, and media-based effects (e.g., mimicking a sitcom or a ""Pop-Up Video"" effect). One moment the characters are walking, the next they're passing through a metaphorical door into their conversation, and as they return there's a clearly-labeled video-game leveled challenge. This is ballsy -- if done poorly, it would've come across as gimmicky and stupid, but Wright pulls it off brilliantly, transitioning seamlessly between styles as if he were merely recording alternating lines of dialogue.The movie is absolutely hilarious, with plenty of internal self-reference, tons of classic tropes and cliches (with ""lampshades hung"" on them to make it clear that the homage is out of love), and some of the best deadpan deliveries I've seen (though, oddly enough, not from Cera). Wright's expert sense of comic timing shines through here -- I never thought I'd hear an entire audience laughing so hard at a guy pausing to tie his shoe.The comedy only pauses for the fights, which are SO insanely over-the-top that you can't even attempt to take them seriously. Seriously, even for a video game, these are pretty crazy! Just sit back and accept that keyboard riffs can become dragons, that veganism gives you super powers, and that you can hit a guy hard enough to turn him into shiny coins. (Ooh, neat!

It's based on a graphic novel (aren't all movies these days?) which pays homage to the classic arcade games that have become relics in the age of the video game console. Scott Pilgrim is very original and creative. I'm also not big on the kind of rock music played throughout the film, but this movie definitely has a killer soundtrack. The script is quirky, the scenery is vibrant, and the actors are all great. I especially loved our new Captain America, Chris Evans. Even Michael Cera is a lively one here, in what is probably his most unique role. The direction was great, and so was just about everything else. Edgar Wright is the pucking (you'll get that if you see it) man. This Blu-ray is one hell of a package on top of the fun film. Picture and audio are bliss.

Zwick,"[8, 11]","""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is a youth-oriented comedy that is destined to divide audiences into two diametrically opposed camps: those who see it as a brilliantly creative and satirical take on modern adolescence, and those who see it as a migraine-inducing, insufferably pretentious exercise in self-conscious self-indulgence that has desperation written all over it.  The movie is definitely an acquired taste, but one thing is for certain: very few who see it will be indifferent to it.Based on the graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is a highly stylized, non-linear account of a 22-year-old geek (played, as always, by Michael Cera) and his surrealistic adventures with his friends and band mates (the cast is indeed enormous) - who are a combination of dorks and Goths and just about everything in between - as they do battle against evil forces, most of them former boyfriends of his current flame (Alison Pill), in snowy Toronto.Writers Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright's attempt to transfer the look and style of graphic literature to the big screen meets with only modest success here (Wright also directed the movie), and it's not too long into the film's nonstop assault on the senses that we're compelled to holler ""Uncle!"" purely out of self-defense.The is-it-a-dream-or-is-it-reality? narrative framework, the frenetic editing, the robotic line-readings, and the words constantly flying all over the screen have a certain novelty and charm at the beginning, but they quickly wear out their welcome - as well as the audience's patience - and all we're left with is a profound sense of relief once the whole thing is finally over.Despite the best of intentions in wanting to do something a little bit different for a change, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" still comes across as a ""cult classic"" trying just a little too hard to become a ""cult classic.""",2,Pass the aspirin,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,1898,"['Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'youth-oriented', 'comedy', 'destined', 'divide', 'audiences', 'two', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'camps', 'who', 'see', 'brilliantly', 'creative', 'satirical', 'take', 'modern', 'adolescence', 'who', 'see', 'migraine-inducing', 'insufferably', 'pretentious', 'exercise', 'self-conscious', 'self-indulgence', 'desperation', 'written', 'movie', 'definitely', 'acquired', 'taste', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'very', 'few', 'who', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'indifferent', 'it.Based', 'graphic', 'novels', 'Bryan', 'Lee', ""O'Malley"", 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'highly', 'stylized', 'non-linear', 'account', '22-year-old', 'geek', 'played', 'always', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'surrealistic', 'adventures', 'friends', 'band', 'mates', 'cast', 'indeed', 'enormous', 'who', 'are', 'combination', 'dorks', 'Goths', 'just', 'everything', 'do', 'battle', 'evil', 'forces', 'most', 'former', 'boyfriends', 'current', 'flame', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'snowy', 'Toronto.Writers', 'Michael', 'Bacall', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'attempt', 'transfer', 'look', 'style', 'graphic', 'literature', 'big', 'screen', 'meets', 'only', 'modest', 'success', 'here', 'Wright', 'also', 'directed', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'nonstop', 'assault', 'senses', ""'re"", 'compelled', 'holler', 'Uncle', 'purely', 'self-defense.The', 'is-it-a-dream-or-is-it-reality', 'narrative', 'framework', 'frenetic', 'editing', 'robotic', 'line-readings', 'words', 'constantly', 'flying', 'screen', 'have', 'certain', 'novelty', 'charm', 'beginning', 'quickly', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'as', 'well', 'audience', 'patience', ""'re"", 'left', 'profound', 'sense', 'relief', 'whole', 'thing', 'finally', 'over.Despite', 'best', 'intentions', 'wanting', 'do', 'something', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'change', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'still', 'cult', 'classic', 'trying', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'become', 'cult', 'classic']",N/A

This is mainly due to Edgar Wright's directing. Wright, the man behind two of the funniest and most inventive films of the 00's, ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz,"" keeps at least the visual aspects of the film constantly interesting. It's not exactly a genre mash-up in the way his other films are; it's based on a comic book, and even when Scott isn't battling opponents in Mortal Kombat-style staging, there's nothing believable to be found here.Michael Cera plays Scott Pilgrim, a Michael Cera-like slacker whose profoundly inarticulate demeanor and inessential position as a bassist for the unsuccessful band Sex Bob-omb somehow makes him attractive to a variety of females. At the moment it's Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), a 17-year old high schooler with typical Asian high-schooler interests, with whom Scott has an aggressively nonsexual relationship. His bandmates include motivated singer-guitarist Stephen Stills (Mark Webber, whose shared name with the classic rock icon is a questionable reference for the film's target audience), deadpan female drummer Kim Pine (Alison Pill), and background guy Young Neil (Johnny Simmons, not such a questionable reference). He lives in a single apartment in which everything is owned by his assertive gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin). He also has a sister (Anna Kendrick) and a strained friendship with the girl who works at the record store AND the coffee shop (Aubrey Plaza). Scott falls in love with Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a low-content character even relative to all the stereotypes listed, and has to battle her seven evil ex's to make the relationship work, or maybe just to keep her attention.It's not all Wright's direction that keeps things interesting. Culkin steals every scene he's in, Wong adds as much emotional depth as the setup allows, and a good number of the ex's are fun. Sly references to Toronto abound. Every now and then some bit of surreal, not hyper-self-conscious humor breaks through.

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,"[1, 1]","Scott Pilgrim Vs The World has it all: It's got romance, comedy, action, and parodies of video games that came and went.At first, I felt like the movie was going kinda off due to how Scott transitioned into another thing he partakes in. I assume it meant how the day was passing by.But the movie was already off to such a great start. You have already heard several humorous jokes, and you've also heard some nods to games like Zelda.Once Scott has been with Romona Flowers, though, that's where the movie seriously picks up! It turns out that she had dated seven evil boyfriends in the past, all of which made of the League of Evil Exes. Yeah, I see you chuckling at your computer. Don't hide it.The action scenes where Scott fights them are both funny and cool. You just wonder how the effects were done throughout the movie. They make it look like a live-action video game. Even when Scott defeats one of the Exes, he (The ex) turns into coins and then the screen says ""2000"" points, or whatever number is used.While the action scenes are thrilling, the comedy will keep you laughing for as long as you live. For example, in a scene where Scott finds out that his ex-girlfriend, Knives, is dating his friend, Neil, his head shows a meter that shows what he should say at the moment. It pointed between a compliment and ""I gotta pee"". The result made Scott say, ""I gotta pee on her""! Gross? I guess, but it's so random that it's funny.The romance scenes actually kinda speak to the audience in a way in which it tells how hard it may be to either break up with somebody or not. You might not know what to do if you run into that kind of situation.The game parodies range from minor to brief.

I think I can be forgiven being that my wife was pregnant with our first child (who incidentally LOVES this movie but more on that later) at the time it was out and I really couldn't go anywhere. For anyone who hasn't seen it yet, I strongly recommend that you do. I think you will know if the film is for you from the moment Scott's band, ""Sex Bob-Omb"", play their first jam minutes into the movie. This is a film that has an incredible amount of life to it. Since watching this film, I have dived headfirst into the world of ""SPvtW"" (I refuse to type out the whole title repeatedly). I've read the manga by Bryan Lee O'Malley, I got the soundtrack and I downloaded the videogame on Xbox Live. The movie is as good an adaptation of the source material that it could've been as it probably would've required at least two films to do it pitch perfect. It's just such a cool film. I think the best compliment I can give this film is that the casting is pitch perfect. Everybody is great in this. If you fall in love with this film like I have, make sure to read the manga and see if you don't agree. Director Edgar Wright didn't knock this out of the park, he punched a third hole in the moon with this film.""SPvtW"" looks terrific in HD and I think it sounds even better. The moment they start playing at the beginning, my speakers went into overdrive. The soundtrack is great for the film and has plenty of great tracks and the surround speakers are used to great effect, especially during the ""boss battles"". This film is also bass heavy throughout, so get ready to give that subwoofer a real workout. There's a lot of extra content (and I do mean A LOT) on the disc focusing on the production, special effects, comparisons to the manga, cartoon vignettes, artwork, and even the usual cast and crew commentaries are worth a listen and full of interesting little anecdotes (the one with the supporting cast is especially hilarious). If you're a fan of the film, you will find quite a bit of material here to supplement the film and expand your enjoyment even further. Set aside some time and go through all the stuff, its all rather interesting.I couldn't tell you how many times I've sat through this film since I've purchased it. It has become the official family film for me, my wife and my two sons. My two year old likes to take his drumsticks and say, ""We are Bob-Omb! 1-2-3-2!"", while he hits the sticks above his head.

Her name is Knives. They play video games together. Scott has a dream about a girl, then meets her in real life. They start to date and now he finds out if they are to continue dating he must fight (literally) her 7 ex-boyfriends. These fights take on the characteristics of video game battles complete with Batman like ""Zonk"" words, special effects, and magical weapons. The humor is at times laugh out loud funny. The dialogue is extremely clever and witty. Scott also lives with (shares a bed with) a gay roommate (Wallace), although Scott is not gay.  Wallace has the ability to immediately text message Scott's sister whenever something happens in Scott's life. He can even do it passed out drunk.

Who else is on that list? - Strange Brew, the Fly, Chloe, Fly Away Home etc. - it's not very long. Canada playing itself in a Hollywood feature isn't that long a list either (some X-Men movies, The Whole Nine Yards, The Score, The Shipping News etc.) I wasn't actually familiar with the zany, anime-style indie comic series the film comes from beforehand. So in brief: it's a wildly energetic, surreal look at young hipsters in Toronto, where battle of the bands at concert venues can become gladiatorial combat. The movie has the same interior logic of film musicals, but instead of breaking out into song when the emotion gets too high, the films breaks out into video game-like battles to the death, where the losers shatter into a shower of coins, and extras lives get awarded for reaching high enough levels of personal maturity!This is the journey 22 year old Canadian rock bassist Scott Pilgrim finds himself on, as to date the woman of his dreams - recent American import Ramona Flowers - he must first defeat her seven evil exes for the right to her hand.

It's a big budget movie from an American studio, directed by a popular British comedy director, and based onan indie Canadian graphic novel series. Obviously, condensing such a long series into a movie is a tricky endeavor, but somehow Edgar Wright manages to make it work. It's funny, action-packed, has some great music and oozes with ridiculous amounts of style. This movie is an eclectic fusion of rock music, comic books and oldschool video games that mesh together into a package that is nothing short of delightful.I cannot stress enough that this movie is a feast for the eyes and ears. It's fight scenes feel like a video game come to life in the best way possible, and really cements the fact that the Street Fighter movies have no excuse for sucking as bad as they do. There's also some great songs written by Beck, as well as a bunch more from numerous artists. If this movie is your cup of tea, I highly recommend picking up the soundtrack.

1348747,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B003L20IE2,trashcanman,"[6, 8]","By now, you've heard the news.  Gamers, nerds, hipsters, outcasts, and cult entertainment fanatics all love Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.  Amazing visuals, killer action, countless nostalgic and timeless pop-culture references, great music, and a purely kinetic and fresh style of filmmaking thrown together into a brand of romantic comedy that will make you cheer instead of gag for a change.  There were moments in this film where I was literally giddy by the wonderful things I was seeing and hearing.  Only potential public shame kept my rear in my seat and my big mouth closed.  Things like the clever use of classic video game music for soundtrack moments, a spontaneous Bollywood-style music number featuring a villain flanked by a troupe of demonic hipster girls spewing flames, enemies who shatter into coins when bested, and the outstanding visual exaggeration of the sounds using comic book sensibilities to illustrate the noises within the film's world simply makes this movie completely irresistible to gamers, comic nerds, otaku, and anybody who just wants to have a good time.  When it comes to comic book films last summer, Scott Pilgrim vs the World gets the high score, hands down.Amazingly, as an adaptation of the charming minimalist graphic novels that make up the Scott Pilgrim saga, this one score an epic KO.  The sensibilities and humor are captured perfectly and even most of the characters resemble their pen-and paper counterparts.  What the film skips in character development (which is a lot) is added back to the story in bombastic music and visuals.  All of the things that couldn't be properly presented in graphic novel form are cranked to the max for the movie and this is what makes Scott Pilgrim vs. the World an amazing big budget adaptation of a very low budget comic.  And the addition of animated flashbacks that look as if they were ripped straight out of the pages doesn't hurt either.  This is definitely how you adapt a cartoonish comic to live action.Now, the Super Mario sound effects, indie rock, anime devices, comic book tropes, and over-the-top combat alone are enough to sell a movie like this to me and those like me (all five of you), and on this superficial level the movie excels, but there is much more.  Most of the reviewers -kind as they've been- seem to have missed the heart and soul of the story.  Scott Pilgrim's battle is first and foremost an allegory for a struggle many young couples go through in the early stages of their relationship.  In this case, our hero meets the girl of his dreams and finds he must conquer her ""7 evil exes"" in order to date her.  Only once he overcomes his intended's past can he hope to accept her as she is and be a part of her future.  This is a core issue at the heart of a great many relationship issues and it's one that few people seem willing to acknowledge.  We all feel like idiots for being insecure about how we may stack up to our significant others' past loves, but that feeling is always going to be there causing problems until you can find a way to do away with it forever and simply accept your love as a separate entity unto itself.  The metaphor of Scott's battles played out in an entertaining and nostalgically familiar manner give this story a wicked one-two punch of genuine heart and madcap fun.  It works on the shallow level of pop-culture references and amazing visuals, but this is clearly a film with a vital and relatable social message as well.Okay enough about the boring stuff.  Scott Pilgrim features a very charming cast (although Michael Cera's typecasting is beginning to grate.  A lot.) that do a wonderful job of bringing the characters to life, but the aspect that stands above all others has to be the soundtrack.  In addition to fighting his ladylove's exes, Scott is also engaged in a battle of the bands tournament as the bassist for Sex Bob-omb, whose fuzzy lo-fi sound (and songs written by Beck) generate massive amounts of sonic energy to accompany some of the more climactic scenes.  My favorite musica; moment has to be the use of the ""game over"" music from an old Zelda game that was unexpectedly delightful.  Talk about taking me back.  That was just outstanding.  So was the background usage of the Rolling Stones ""Under My Thumb"".  There are also some band showdown scenes to rival anything rock-related that has ever been put up on the silver screen. And the snarky humor is wonderful.  If you've ever wondered what happens should an obnoxious vegan accidentally ingest an animal product (the world doesn't actually end as some may think), then you may bust a gut at one point in a moment of glorious commentary on trendy pseudo-politics.  This film hits you hard from all angles.  Picture Tenacious D, Kick-Ass, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Clerks, and Kung-Fu Hustle having an orgy on top of a pile of old Nintendo Power magazines, and you'll have some idea of what to expect when you see Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.  SOME.While this is simply a must-see film for anybody with even a vague interest in geek culture, it's not quite perfect and probably won't appeal to the self-aware pretentious film critic type, proper ladies who need shopping montages and steamy idealized love scenes in their movies of choice, or the ""dude-bro"" contingent awaiting the next Michael Bay joint so much.  Sorry, no Oscars or opening weekend records for you, Scottie boy.  The object of our hero's affection, a sexy but standoffish girl named Ramona who changes her hair color every week-and-a-half, is indeed an intriguing lady, but not nearly as likable as she should be (and is in the comic).  The fact of the matter is we the audience are never really given a reason to love her like Scott does.  We love the poor little geek girl Scott dumps for her (and with a name like Knives Chau, how could you not love her?), but Ramona herself is aloof and undeveloped.  Throughout the film she remains somebody we'd simply like to get to know better who should try smiling once in a while. Rammy's inherent charm is the biggest thing lost in translation from comic to screen. Generally speaking, before one goes all in slaying all of the relationship demons at the expense of our short-term mental health, one should first be assured that the prize is one worth fighting for.  But considering how inventive and wonderfully entertaining this film is, you've got to let that one slide.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is pure joy for the young-at-heart and yet another gift from the man who brought us Shaun of the Dead and Spaced.  It's got some of the greatest sights and sounds out there and does an amazingly concise job of condensing a very long and involved story into a single spectacularly fun motion picture. And for once, most of the changes made from the source material don't detract from the story.  In fact, the most awesomest (hooked on phonics didn't work for me) scene in the film never even happened in the comics. So big love to Edgar Wright for bringing one of the most beloved comic sagas of the last decade to life in mind-blowing fashion and boo to all opposed. So in conclusion, Scott Pilgrim is funnier than the comedies you are currently carrying on about, it's more visually stunning than whatever was blowing you away last summer, and the music kicks the hell out of that CD you just bought and will forget about in a month.  Check it out if you think you`re geek enough.4  stars rounded up for bringing the noise.",5,Mmmm...geeky!,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,7478,"['now', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'news', 'Gamers', 'nerds',

1348752,A1ASGRO3X620BD,B003L20IE2,T. Smith,"[2, 2]","I don't give very many five star reviews, but after careful thought, I couldn't give this film anything but.  It set out to do something and achieved what it wanted to, 100%.I had been reading O'Malley's books for years, but when I heard Scott Pilgrim was being made into a movie, I just rolled my eyes.  As a friend in the comics business once told me, ""They're going to screw your book.  Just decide how much you want to be paid to get screwed.""  Now, this isn't as true as it used to be--a new generation of directors who understand comics are finally producing good work, like Watchmen--but it's still the way to bet.  Which I why I was surprised when I heard from Bryan that he was pretty excited about it.  Still....I was aware the film was being made but was too nervous to keep track of it.  Even after it came out I dragged my feet about seeing it, then finally went near the end of the run.And I LOVED it!Not only is it the best possible adaptation of the book, it is pure 100% fun.  I was talking to a comic book artist I know and raving about it.  He's a HUGE Scott Pilgrim fan and loved it.  Then he said: ""Too bad it bombed, huh?""  I was truly shocked--I had no idea.  I couldn't believe how anyone couldn't like the movie.  It's imaginative, original, well-written, well-acted, and awesomely, perfectly over-the-top.And now that I have the BR and have rewatched it twice (plus 3x with all the commentaries) I am still agog that it wasn't a huge hit.  (Michael Cera has glumly said ""We got blindsided by eight guys called The Expendables"".)  I think the problem some people have with it is that they aren't willing to just go with the flow and accept the strange reality the movie takes place in.Edgar put his heart and soul into this movie and it shows on every frame.  I don't know how many times I'd have to watch it to catch all the references and inside jokes, and the backgrounds are so fill of tidbits I've had to step through some scenes almost frame-by-frame in a probably futile attempt to catch them all.  The details are amazing, from the note-perfect Bollywood style of the fight with Patel (eg, the demon sisters all have big racks, and if you've ever watched a Bollywood film...) to the promo posters for the bands and the way the lyrics of the music often intercut and play off the script.The actors committed to this film above and beyond the call of duty.  Let's face it, training Michael Cera to do long choreographed fight shots and look good doing it must have taken a hell of a lot of work on his part and the part of the fight choreographers.  Cera commented that the thing he looked forward to most at the end of filming was ""never doing another pushup again in my life.""  But like them or not, he did them anyway during the filming.And of course for several of the actors, they had to go from wondering what side of their musical instrument was up to playing live and recording the soundtrack.  Only Cera and Larson had previous experience, and neither of them professionally.  (Larson has a lovely voice!)Cera's acting does the job it needs to.  He's pretty Scott Pilgrim-like.  (I howled with laughter at his delivery of the line ""But it's haaaard!"")  Culkin steals the movie, as others have noted here.  Most of the other parts don't call for ACTING! as much as in most movies, but again, most of the actors do their work.  The exception is the clumsy and leaden performance by Anna Kendrick as Stacey Pilgrim.  My god, she's awful.  But I need to give a special shout-out to Alison Pill who IS Kim Pine.  It was almost creepy.  Oh yeah, and Jason Schwatzman is brilliant as Gideon.  A complete a-hole, just as he should be.I doubt anyone who has read this far (if anyone ever does) is not already a fan of the movie.  But talk a few people into watching it with you, or lend out the disk.  I think this movie will be a (semi) cult classic, and hopefully after a few years it will at least make its money back.  It's just too cruel that Scott Pilgrim vs the World should be a Bob-omb.Scott Pilgrim FTW!",5,Rating: Awesome,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,4044,"['do', ""n't"", 'give', 'very', 'many', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'careful', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'anything', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'something', 'achieved', 'what', 'wanted', '100', '%', '.I', 'had', 'been', 'reading', ""O'Malley"", 'books', 'years', 'when', 'heard', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'movie', 'just', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'friend', 'comics', 'business', 'once', 'told', ""'re"", 'going', 'screw', 'book', 'Just', 'decide', 'how', 'much', 'want', 'be', 'paid', 'get', 'screwed', 'Now', ""n't"", 'as', 'true', 'used', 'be', 'new', 'generation', 'directors', 'who', 'understand', 'comics', 'are', 'finally', 'producing', 'good', 'work', 'Watchmen', 'still', 'way', 'bet', 'Which', 'why', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'heard', 'Bryan', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'Still', '.I', 'was', 'aware', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'was', 'too', 'nervous', 'keep', 'track', 'Even', 'came', 'out', 'dragged', 'feet', 'seeing', 'then', 'finally', 'went', 'end', 'run.And', 'LOVED', 'Not', 'only', 'best', 'possible', 'adaptation', 'book', 'pure', '100', '%', 'fun', 'was', 'talking', 'comic', 'book', 'artist', 'know', 'raving', 'HUGE', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'fan', 'loved', 'Then', 'said', 'Too', 'bad', 'bombed', 'huh', 'was', 'truly', 'shocked', 'had', 'idea', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'imaginative', 'original', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'awesomely', 'perfectly', 'over-the-top.And', 'now', 'have', 'BR', 'have', 'rewatched', 'twice', '3x', 'commentaries', 'am', 'still', 'agog', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'hit', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'glumly', 'said', 'got', 'blindsided', 'eight', 'guys', 'called', 'Expendables', 'think', 'problem', 'people', 'have', 'are', ""n't"", 'willing', 'just', 'go', 'flow', 'accept', 'strange', 'reality', 'movie', 'place', 'in.Edgar', 'put', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'frame', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'d"", 'have', 'watch', 'catch', 'references', 'inside', 'jokes', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'so', 'fill', 'tidbits', ""'ve"", 'had', 'step', 'scenes', 'almost', 'frame-by-frame', 'probably', 'futile', 'attempt', 'catch', 'details', 'are', 'amazing', 'note-perfect', 'Bollywood', 'style', 'fight', 'Patel', 'eg', 'demon', 'sisters', 'have', 'big', 'racks', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'promo', 'posters', 'bands', 'way', 'lyrics', 'music', 'often', 'intercut', 'play', 'off', 'script.The', 'actors', 'committed', 'film', 'call', 'duty', 'Let', 'face', 'training', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'do', 'long', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'shots', 'look', 'good', 'doing', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'hell', 'lot', 'work', 'part', 'part', 'fight', 'choreographers', 'Cera', 'commented', 'thing', 'looked', 'forward', 'most', 'end', 'filming', 'was', 'never', 'doing', 'pushup', 'again', 'life', 'not', 'did', 'anyway', 'filming.And', 'course', 'several', 'actors', 'had', 'go', 'wondering', 'what', 'side', 'musical', 'instrument', 'was', 'up', 'playing', 'live', 'recording', 'soundtrack', 'Only', 'Cera', 'Larson', 'had', 'previous', 'experience', 'professionally', 'Larson', 'lovely', 'voice', 'Cera', 'acting', 'job', 'pretty', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim-like', 'howled', 'laughter', 'delivery', 'line', 'haaaard', 'Culkin', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'here', 'Most', 'other', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'ACTING', 'as', 'much', 'most', 'movies', 'again', 'most', 'actors', 'do', 'work', 'exception', 'clumsy', 'leaden', 'performance', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'Stacey', 'Pilgrim', 'My', 'god', 'awful', 'need', 'give', 'special', 'shout-out', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'who', 'Kim', 'Pine', 'was', 'almost', 'creepy', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Jason', 'Schwatzman', 'brilliant', 'Gideon', 'complete', 'a-hole', 'just', 'should', 'be.I', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'far', 'anyone', 'ever', 'not', 'already', 'fan', 'movie', 'talk', 'few', 'people', 'watching', 'lend', 'out', 'disk', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'semi', 'cult', 'classic', 'hopefully', 'few', 'years', 'will', 'least', 'make', 'money', 'back', 'just', 'too', 'cruel', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'World', 'should', 'be', 'Bob-omb.Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'FTW']",N/A
1348753,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003L20IE2,Turfseer,"[3, 8]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***For those who have been trying to figure out which media influenced the scenarists of 'Scott Pilgrim', how about MTV, old 80s video games, comic books and Quentin Tarrantino? There's one other that may only occur to the older population watching this film: Batman, the 60s TV show. Remember all the zany titles which would appear whenever something dramatic happened (titles such as ""Sock!"", ""Pow!"", ""Bong!"")? A similar technique is employed here with Scott Pilgrim but the titles are often inserted for a more farcical comic book effect (for example, when a phone rings, the title ""ring"" zips across the screen). One or two word titles are also utilized to describe each character (so if the narrator mentions someone is 'clueless', it's also mentioned again as a title description). 'Pilgrim' wins points for its original visual style, featuring nifty camera work and spectacular special effects which often makes one feel as if one is inside of a crazy video game.Unfortunately, Pilgrim's story is as bland as the title character. Michael Cera (playing another geeky role) is awful as a 22 year old garage band musician who first dates a perky high school student (""Knives Chau"") but then dumps her for the more mysterious Ramona Flowers (winningly played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Cera's Pilgrim can do nothing more than act like a love sick puppy dog opposite the much more aggressive Flowers from beginning to end.In real life, the enigmatic Flowers would never go for the wimpy Pilgrim who always seems to be kow-towing to her during their many platonic interactions. Somehow, Flowers decides to give Pilgrim a second chance after he defeats her 7th ex-boyfriend Gideon (Pilgrim's ex-bands' new sponsor) in a long-winded fight scene (Flowers is not really 'attracted' to boyfriend #7; actually, he's planted a micro-chip in her brain causing her to fall for him!).That's basically the crux of the Pilgrim plot--our 'hero' must go toe to toe with all of Flowers' evil exes before he can win back the object of his infatuation. The seven confrontations (which include a woman, one of Ramona's bi-flings) are nothing more than a device to stage a series of silly fight scenes reminiscent of Tarrantino's stylized sword fights in ""Kill Bill"". None of it makes any sense, especially when perky and cute Knives attacks Ramona out of jealousy over her relationship with Pilgrim. Should I also mention that Pilgrim is stabbed to death, goes to limbo but discovers he has an ""extra life"" that enables him to return to earth so he can do battle with Gideon all over again.None of the supporting players exhibit any charm. Pilgrim's gay roommate, for example, puts Pilgrim down when he advises Knives not to get involved with him during their first meet up. And then there's Pilgrim's drummer and ex-girlfriend Kim Pine; why exactly does she have a dour expression on her face throughout the film? There's also little humor in the film--one attempt (if you can call it that) occurs with Ramona's third ex, Todd; he's stymied when he's stripped of his 'vegan psychic' powers by the 'vegan police' who have discovered that he's been putting half and half (non-vegan milk substitute) in his coffee.In the end, one can only conclude that 'Pilgrim' is a pointless endeavor. Should we regard 'Pilgrim' as an honorable character after he engages in these violent confrontations with a group of one-dimensional, comic book villains? Even worse is how emasculated Pilgrim comes off as he is led around on a leash by a much more hip Ramona. This is a film strictly for teenagers. Its failure to appeal to an older, more sophisticated crowd spelled doom at the box office in the American market.",2,"Pacman meets Tarrantino meets MTV meets Batman, the 60s TV Show",1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,3723,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***For', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'media', 'influenced', 'scenarists', ""'Scott"", 'Pilgrim', 'how', 'about', 'MTV', 'old', '80s', 'video', 'games', 'comic', 'books', 'Quentin', 'Tarrantino', 'one', 'other', 'may', 'only', 'occur', 'older', 'population', 'watching', 'film', 'Batman', '60s', 'TV', 'show', 'Remember', 'zany', 'titles', 'would', 'appear', 'something', 'dramatic', 'happened', 'titles', 'such', 'Sock', 'Pow', 'Bong', 'similar', 'technique', 'employed', 'here', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'titles', 'are', 'often', 'inserted', 'more', 'farcical', 'comic', 'book', 'effect', 'example', 'when', 'phone', 'rings', 'title', 'ring', 'zips', 'screen', 'One', 'two', 'word', 'titles', 'are', 'also', 'utilized', 'describe', 'character', 'so', 'narrator', 'mentions', 'someone', ""'clueless"", 'also', 'mentioned', 'again', 'title', 'description', 'wins', 'points', 'original', 'visual', 'style', 'featuring', 'nifty', 'camera', 'work', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'often', 'one', 'feel', 'one', 'crazy', 'video', 'game.Unfortunately', 'Pilgrim', 'story', 'as', 'bland', 'title', 'character', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'playing', 'geeky', 'role', 'awful', '22', 'year', 'old', 'garage', 'band', 'musician', 'who', 'first', 'perky', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Chau', 'then', 'more', 'mysterious', 'Ramona', 'Flowers', 'winningly', 'played', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Cera', 'Pilgrim', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'act', 'love', 'sick', 'puppy', 'dog', 'much', 'more', 'aggressive', 'Flowers', 'beginning', 'end.In', 'real', 'life', 'enigmatic', 'Flowers', 'would', 'never', 'go', 'wimpy', 'Pilgrim', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'kow-towing', 'many', 'platonic', 'interactions', 'Somehow', 'Flowers', 'give', 'Pilgrim', 'second', 'chance', '7th', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Gideon', 'Pilgrim', 'ex-bands', 'new', 'sponsor', 'long-winded', 'fight', 'scene', 'Flowers', 'not', 'really', ""'attracted"", 'boyfriend', '7', 'actually', 'planted', 'micro-chip', 'brain', 'causing', 'fall', '.That', 'basically', 'crux', 'Pilgrim', 'plot', ""'hero"", 'must', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'Flowers', 'evil', 'exes', 'can', 'win', 'back', 'object', 'infatuation', 'seven', 'confrontations', 'include', 'woman', 'one', 'Ramona', 'bi-flings', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'device', 'stage', 'series', 'silly', 'fight', 'scenes', 'reminiscent', 'Tarrantino', 'stylized', 'sword', 'fights', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'None', 'sense', 'especially', 'when', 'perky', 'cute', 'Knives', 'attacks', 'Ramona', 'jealousy', 'relationship', 'Pilgrim', 'Should', 'also', 'mention', 'Pilgrim', 'stabbed', 'death', 'limbo', 'discovers', 'extra', 'life', 'return', 'earth', 'so', 'can', 'do', 'battle', 'Gideon', 'again.None', 'supporting', 'players', 'exhibit', 'charm', 'Pilgrim', 'gay', 'roommate', 'example', 'Pilgrim', 'down', 'when', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'first', 'meet', 'up', 'then', 'Pilgrim', 'drummer', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Kim', 'Pine', 'why', 'exactly', 'have', 'dour', 'expression', 'face', 'film', 'also', 'little', 'humor', 'film', 'one', 'attempt', 'can', 'call', 'Ramona', 'third', 'ex', 'Todd', 'stymied', 'when', 'stripped', ""'vegan"", 'psychic', 'powers', ""'vegan"", 'police', 'who', 'have', 'discovered', 'been', 'putting', 'half', 'half', 'non-vegan', 'milk', 'substitute', 'coffee.In', 'end', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', ""'Pilgrim"", 'pointless', 'endeavor', 'Should', 'regard', 'honorable', 'character', 'violent', 'confrontations', 'group', 'one-dimensional', 'comic', 'book', 'villains', 'Even', 'worse', 'how', 'emasculated', 'Pilgrim', 'off', 'led', 'around', 'leash', 'much', 'more', 'hip', 'Ramona', 'film', 'strictly', 'teenagers', 'failure', 'appeal', 'older', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'crowd', 'spelled', 'doom', 'box', 'office', 'American', 'market']",N/A

Edgar Wright and Co. put a unfathomable amount of effort into making this film, and it crashed horribly in theaters.  This is a astounding movie by all means, but America/The World, had no interest in seeing it.  Some blame it on marketing, but I argue that the general public wasn't ready for such a odd/ambitious film.  You don't really know what Scott Pilgrim is till you read it or see it.  I asked people who never read comics what they thought of the trailer, and they all thought it was garbage.  This is because the concept may seem a little goofy, but the end result was so fascinating.  All that remains now is a cult classic that was payed for only by the Scott Pilgrim readers for the most part.  At least us fans got the treat of a lifetime.The Disc:Edgar always stuffs way too much material on his blu-rays, but that seems to be ok this time around.  SP's whopping 4 commentaries were all entertaining, unlike Shaun of the Dead's.  The featurettes were all very interesting, and I wasn't bored at all while watching them.  The MAJOR flaw with the disc is an aspect ratio problem where text cuts out on the sides of the screen.  I haven't quite learned to accept that problem.The Film:Scott Pilgrim is one of the best comic book movies, and it certainly was one of the hardest to adapt.  They had to cram 7 villains into the movie, and cover a lot of material, while also being true to the tone of the books.  Edgar Wright did a fantastic job, and I promise you no one was better for the job.  I also argue with the Cera haters, by saying that Michael was the best one for the job.  He gave the movie something it would have been missing.  The variable.  It would have been such a literal adaptation, or a boring adaptation without him.  His own flair gave the flick a whole new dimension.  The fight scenes are good, but I hold my least favorites at the end, while the second fight is the best.  The action overall is a lot of fun, but nothing to jump up and down about.  What is important and fresh here, is the comedy.  The humor is unlike any comedy I've seen, including Edgar Wright's previous films.  It's a bubbly, sarcastic masterpiece, filled with gutbursters.  The other great thing to note about this movie is all the video-game references.  It gives the casual gamer a nerd-gasm.It's absolutely worth its money.  One of the best movies of 2010, and one of the best comic book movies of all time, Scott Pilgrim is extremely entertaining if you are brave enough to watch it.  Don't be the general audience who settle for such mediocrity as The Expendables.  Venture out and you will be rewarded.  Scott Pilgrim is unlike anything you've seen before.  That's why they call it a game-changer.",5,The Box-Office Tragedy of 2010,1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,2798,"['almost', 'well', 'tears', 'when', 'look', 'behind-the-scenes', 'clips', 'movie', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'Co.', 'put', 'unfathomable', 'amount', 'effort', 'making', 'film', 'crashed', 'horribly', 'theaters', 'astounding', 'movie', 'means', 'America/The', 'World', 'had', 'interest', 'seeing', 'blame', 'marketing', 'argue', 'general', 'public', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'such', 'odd/ambitious', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'read', 'see', 'asked', 'people', 'who', 'never', 'read', 'comics', 'what', 'thought', 'trailer', 'thought', 'was', 'garbage', 'concept', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'goofy', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'so', 'fascinating', 'now', 'cult', 'classic', 'was', 'payed', 'only', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'readers', 'most', 'part', 'least', 'fans', 'got', 'treat', 'lifetime.The', 'Disc', 'Edgar', 'always', 'stuffs', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'material', 'blu-rays', 'be', 'time', 'around', 'SP', 'whopping', '4', 'commentaries', 'were', 'entertaining', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'featurettes', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored', 'watching', 'MAJOR', 'flaw', 'disc', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'problem', 'where', 'text', 'out', 'sides', 'screen', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'learned', 'accept', 'problem.The', 'Film', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'certainly', 'was', 'one', 'hardest', 'adapt', 'had', 'cram', '7', 'villains', 'movie', 'cover', 'lot', 'material', 'also', 'being', 'true', 'tone', 'books', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'promise', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'job', 'also', 'argue', 'Cera', 'haters', 'saying', 'Michael', 'was', 'best', 'one', 'job', 'gave', 'movie', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'variable', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'literal', 'adaptation', 'boring', 'adaptation', 'own', 'flair', 'gave', 'flick', 'whole', 'new', 'dimension', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'hold', 'least', 'favorites', 'end', 'second', 'fight', 'best', 'action', 'overall', 'lot', 'fun', 'nothing', 'jump', 'up', 'down', 'about', 'What', 'important', 'fresh', 'here', 'comedy', 'humor', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'including', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'previous', 'films', 'bubbly', 'sarcastic', 'masterpiece', 'filled', 'gutbursters', 'other', 'great', 'thing', 'note', 'movie', 'video-game', 'references', 'casual', 'gamer', 'nerd-gasm.It', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'money', 'One', 'best', 'movies', '2010', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'time', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'are', 'brave', 'enough', 'watch', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'general', 'audience', 'who', 'such', 'mediocrity', 'Expendables', 'Venture', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'why', 'call', 'game-changer']",N/A

I was fortunate to see it on opening weekend, and I have to say that I was very satisfied. Scott Pilgrim VS. The World like the other well known Edgar Wright films such as Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz is just as fast and just as zaney. What made me want to see this film of course besides the director is that this story is based on a 6 volume graphic novel. Also the cast is quite incredible and especially with the library of films that Michael Cera has to his name, colaborating with Wright was something that intrigued me. Scott Pilgrim is a two hour geeks wet dream, there is so much awesomeness you take away from this film. The pop culture references, the comic book/anime/video game theme throughout and the acting dare I say it at least for the film it was suppose to be was brilliant. As far as the actors go, as I expected Keiran Culkin pratically stole this movie. His character in the book was the funniest and did not disappoint with his performance. Another surprise for me was the newcommer Ellen Wong. I mean she played a girl named Knives...how cool is that?! Finally, I have to say that I was very impressed with Michael Cera in this movie, while he still uses his typical charm that you have seen in his films, he actually is not a fall back guy he actually grabs his balls and takes charge as the main character so I gotta say he did quite a good job as Scott Pilgrim.Compared to the books, it starts out accurate pratically page for page, but as it progresses starts to go in a very different direction. Most fans of the book would probably be a little upset Still, for a movie based on this story it was for the better. This movie still kept the main meat of the story intact and kept the fun factor sky high. I do have to say that Scott Pilgrim VS. The World is not a movie for everyone, but based on what I have said if you feel this is something you would enjoy I suggest you see it because you will most likely love it! Oh of course if you have seen this movie like I did (3 times to be exact) The DVD/Blue Ray is totally worth it!

I didn't like the comic book-like sequences because they were incredibly strange and bizarre.

The plot of the movie by the way, is for this little nerd to fight off 7 of his girlfriend's ex's.The only redeeming value this movie has lies in it's action, music, and entertainment. None of the characters are inherently funny so don't expect laughs galore. This movie is not unlike Jackie Chan's movies whose entertainment value come more from onscreen theatrics than a good solid plot.One interesting tidbit about this Blu Ray: you have the option of watching a storyboard in one of the pop up menus.

It's a movie that had a lot of good ideas but ultimately fell short.  As a longtime video gamer, I appreciated the many game references the movie is built on -- with some caveats I'll cover in a moment.  The film is bursting with experimental and fun concepts.  Most of the small ones work, like the labels that pop up on screen next to furniture, people, etc.; and many of the clever little dialog quips (a.k.a. one-liners) were cute.  The mixture of animation with live action was a good thing, especially the spirit animals in the Twins battle.  So there were a lot of things I liked about Scott Pilgrim, but there were problems too.  First, the music wasn't that good.  For such an important element of a movie, it has some pretty ordinary rock songs. I mean, the main character is in a band, and part of the story is set in a Battle of the Bands competition.  Other movies featuring original tunes, such as the otherwise forgettable The Rocker (the one with Rainn Wilson), at least managed to get the music element right, but here it's weak.  Second, after an interesting and cool opening scene, the story goes into about a 10-minute lull where mostly boring stuff is going on.  This slow start had me wondering, ""so when is the fun stuff going to happen""?  A related problem occurs with the ending, which I thought was pretty dopey.  Finally, there's an overly repetitive aspect to the fights with the 7 Evil Exes.  Just too many similar shots of people flying through the air and punching or kicking eachother.  This repetitiveness problem even applies to otherwise fun elements from video games.  By the final battle, I was thinking, ""oh, it's the Street Fighter guy talking again"" and ""oh, the coins are raining down again."" Ho hum...  It would have been better if there were maybe 4 Exes instead of 7, I think.  My bottom line on this movie is it was fun, but for me it wasn't the perfect film others seem to have watched.  I hope people actually read my review, but I'm afraid they just came out of the movie only remembering the good parts, and won't make it past my rating -- they'll reflexively hate my review simply because I didn't give 5 stars.  I would ask them - did you actually love the music?  Did you like the ending?  But they'll still vote 'NO' on my review.
