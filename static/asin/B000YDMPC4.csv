1118946,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000YDMPC4,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","I've seen many complaints from reviewers that Resurrecting the Champ is just a flat out boring film.  I can see why so many people are coming to that conclusion.The story isn't one of the best, that's for sure, and the film is certainly NOTHING like the classic Rocky films, so don't go assuming there will be a dramatic boxing match at the end of the movie that will satisfy your secret love for intense punching action, because it ain't gonna happen.  Completely different movies.What makes the storyline sort of boring is the fact that WAY too much of it focuses on the aimless walking and talking reporter aspect, and less on communicating with the boxer himself.I don't know about you, but I would have been MUCH more satisfied had most of the movie been devoted to scenes showing Samuel L. Jackson's character, and less on the other guy who played the reporter role.Resurrecting the Champ is about a news reporter looking for a big story to cover for the paper, and through a painfully slow and uninteresting build-up in character development and storyline, the reporter eventually finds a homeless man living on the streets that used to be a big-name boxer a long time ago... or at least, that's what it appears.  Keep watching the film to see what's REALLY going on.Why the movie doesn't stack up to the hype is because the story is just so sloooooow to not only get going, but to actually GET anywhere.  The pace never picks up for its entire 2-hour running time, and despite a magnificent performance by Samuel L. Jackson, you have to be *very* patient to sit still and pay attention to a storyline that's honestly mediocre at best.However, despite the problems, I can't deny I was sitting there and enjoying the film, and I really was curious to see the next plot development... for whatever reason.  Maybe I was just in the mood to watch a movie this afternoon, who knows?  Maybe I wanted to believe the hype?I'll give the movie a 4 out of 5 rating, but you should know it's a weak 4, maybe even a high 3.",4,"might test your patience, let's be honest",1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,2017,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'complaints', 'reviewers', 'Resurrecting', 'Champ', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'boring', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'coming', 'conclusion.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'one', 'best', 'sure', 'film', 'certainly', 'NOTHING', 'classic', 'Rocky', 'films', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'assuming', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'dramatic', 'boxing', 'match', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'satisfy', 'secret', 'love', 'intense', 'punching', 'action', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'happen', 'Completely', 'different', 'storyline', 'sort', 'boring', 'fact', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'aimless', 'walking', 'talking', 'reporter', 'aspect', 'less', 'communicating', 'boxer', 'himself.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'MUCH', 'more', 'satisfied', 'had', 'most', 'movie', 'been', 'devoted', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'character', 'less', 'other', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'reporter', 'role.Resurrecting', 'Champ', 'news', 'reporter', 'looking', 'big', 'story', 'cover', 'paper', 'painfully', 'slow', 'uninteresting', 'build-up', 'character', 'development', 'storyline', 'reporter', 'eventually', 'homeless', 'man', 'living', 'streets', 'used', 'be', 'big-name', 'boxer', 'long', 'time', 'least', 'what', 'Keep', 'watching', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'REALLY', 'going', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stack', 'up', 'hype', 'story', 'just', 'so', 'sloooooow', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'going', 'actually', 'GET', 'anywhere', 'pace', 'never', 'up', 'entire', '2-hour', 'running', 'time', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'have', 'be', '*very*', 'patient', 'sit', 'still', 'pay', 'attention', 'storyline', 'honestly', 'mediocre', 'best.However', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'was', 'sitting', 'there', 'enjoying', 'film', 'really', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'next', 'plot', 'development', 'reason', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'mood', 'watch', 'movie', 'afternoon', 'who', 'Maybe', 'wanted', 'believe', 'hype', ""'ll"", 'give', 'movie', '4', '5', 'rating', 'should', 'know', 'weak', '4', 'maybe', 'even', 'high', '3']",Resurrecting The Champ
1118947,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B000YDMPC4,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","This was a very entertaining film with just the right mixture of action, drama, romance and intrigue. The latter - a big shock that occurs two-thirds of the way through the story - gives it its unique flavor. Otherwise, it's still a nice story of fathers-and-sons and the love and respect that's so important between the two of them. It also involves husbands and wives reconciling.I've seen Samuel L. Jackson in a lot of movies and so I am quite aware what a fine actor he is, so I wasn't surprised he was so good in this film. However, I was still stunned at his performance. It's definitely the best character I've seen him play, partly because of his sentimental role but more so simply because he dominated this film. Josh Hartnett was fine in the co-leading role of this story but it was Jackson who really got my attention in every scene.This is a very involving story that grabs you and won't let go. What is it about boxing stories, or stories that involve boxers, that make them so memorable? I don't know, but I've seen very few bad ones and certainly no boring ones. Many of them, like this one, have more of a human element than just being a sport story. Actually, there isn't a lot of ring action in this film, so I wouldn't label it a boxing film. As a drama, or whatever you want to label it, it's a fine movie and a good way to spend two hours.",5,Jackson Is Fantastic Here In Yet Another Excellent Drama Involving Boxing,1226707200,"11 15, 2008",2008,1361,"['was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'just', 'right', 'mixture', 'action', 'drama', 'romance', 'intrigue', 'latter', 'big', 'shock', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'story', 'unique', 'flavor', 'Otherwise', 'still', 'nice', 'story', 'fathers-and-sons', 'love', 'respect', 'so', 'important', 'two', 'also', 'husbands', 'wives', 'reconciling.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'lot', 'movies', 'so', 'am', 'quite', 'aware', 'what', 'fine', 'actor', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'film', 'However', 'was', 'still', 'stunned', 'performance', 'definitely', 'best', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'partly', 'sentimental', 'role', 'more', 'so', 'simply', 'dominated', 'film', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'was', 'fine', 'co-leading', 'role', 'story', 'was', 'Jackson', 'who', 'really', 'got', 'attention', 'scene.This', 'very', 'involving', 'story', 'grabs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'What', 'boxing', 'stories', 'stories', 'involve', 'boxers', 'make', 'so', 'memorable', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'few', 'bad', 'ones', 'certainly', 'boring', 'ones', 'Many', 'one', 'have', 'more', 'human', 'element', 'just', 'being', 'sport', 'story', 'Actually', ""n't"", 'lot', 'ring', 'action', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'label', 'boxing', 'film', 'drama', 'want', 'label', 'fine', 'movie', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours']",Resurrecting The Champ

1118951,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000YDMPC4,Kevin Killian,"[4, 10]","We saw this movie right after a trailer for JUMPER, a time travel saga in which Samuel Jackson wears very close cropped hair in a shade of cotton white, forever attempting to pin Hayden Christensen down to real time using mountaineering spikes to do the job.  At this point my little boy asked me if it was true that Samuel Jackson is in every movie.  Yes, I told him, and as if to prove my point the lights went down and then up again on Jackson once more with white hair, but this time long loose cornrows of flyaway hobo hair, white and bedraggled with pieces of crab grass and straw sewn into it, as though truly proving he just doesn't care any more.Apparently he was once an admired boxer, in the very early 50s, and now down on his luck he prowls Denver's darkest alley trundling along in a shopping cart and avoiding homeless bashers.  Josh Hartnett, as Eric Junior, son of a famous sportscaster, stumbles into him and soon realizes, this may be his ticket into the big leagues if he can do a creditable job on the story, give it some heart, he could slip it past heartless editor Alan Alda at the Denver Post, and make the cover of the paper's magazine section.  All this in an attempt to look good in the eyes of his former wife Kathryn Morris (in exaggerated, Goldie Hawn style makeup and hairdos) and his little boy who looks to be around 6.  For some reason I didn't figure out, he lost their respect a while back and now he's got one last chance to rewin them and make the nuclear family whole again.  I don't know if Josh Hartnett is the ideal actor to play this part, but I guess they thought, Jimmy Stewart is dead and Sally Field is a woman, so why not get Josh?  If there's scene chewing to be done, we already have Sam Jackson.John Elway also makes an appearance as a typical Denver celebrity spotted by Josh's son at an alfresco restaurant and he insists that Dad must know him (for Josh has bragged to his son about his intimacy with all the greats of sport).  Elway has a winning screen presence and I would have liked to see what he could have done playing the champ turned hobo.  There's no reason why he had to be black.But why did he have to be so old?  I don't know how old Jackson really is, but if the boxer in question saw his career come to a virtual end by Christmas of 1953 (as the movie takes great pains to establish), wouldn't he have to be, I don't know, 75 by now?  Jackson plays the role as though he had just gotten out of junior college, boisterous, rambling a mile a minute, with never flagging energy.  I guess he had to hail from an era before TV so there could be this lingering doubt about his identity but the ridiculousness of it all merits a demerit in my strict ratings system.  Beyond that, I asked my little one which of the three women Josh is involved with (Morris, Teri Hatcher, or Rachel Nichols from ALIAS)would make the best surrogate mother.  He said, Teri Hatcher hands down, as the ruthless, amoral TV executive from Showtime who cares about only two things, ratings number one, and Josh Hartnett horizontal the other.  So I give it a four out of five, docked a notch for being needlessly preposterous in that Rod Lurie way.",4,Heart Tugging Ring Saga,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,3186,"['saw', 'movie', 'right', 'trailer', 'JUMPER', 'time', 'travel', 'saga', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'very', 'close', 'cropped', 'hair', 'shade', 'cotton', 'white', 'forever', 'attempting', 'pin', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'down', 'real', 'time', 'using', 'mountaineering', 'spikes', 'do', 'job', 'point', 'little', 'boy', 'asked', 'was', 'true', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'movie', 'Yes', 'told', 'prove', 'point', 'lights', 'went', 'down', 'then', 'up', 'again', 'Jackson', 'once', 'more', 'white', 'hair', 'time', 'long', 'loose', 'cornrows', 'flyaway', 'hobo', 'hair', 'white', 'bedraggled', 'pieces', 'crab', 'grass', 'straw', 'sewn', 'truly', 'proving', 'just', ""n't"", 'care', 'more.Apparently', 'was', 'once', 'admired', 'boxer', 'very', 'early', '50s', 'now', 'down', 'luck', 'Denver', 'darkest', 'alley', 'trundling', 'along', 'shopping', 'cart', 'avoiding', 'homeless', 'bashers', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Eric', 'Junior', 'son', 'famous', 'sportscaster', 'stumbles', 'soon', 'realizes', 'may', 'be', 'ticket', 'big', 'leagues', 'can', 'do', 'creditable', 'job', 'story', 'give', 'heart', 'could', 'slip', 'past', 'heartless', 'editor', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Denver', 'Post', 'make', 'cover', 'paper', 'magazine', 'section', 'attempt', 'look', 'good', 'eyes', 'former', 'wife', 'Kathryn', 'Morris', 'exaggerated', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'style', 'makeup', 'hairdos', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'around', '6', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'lost', 'respect', 'while', 'back', 'now', 'got', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'rewin', 'make', 'nuclear', 'family', 'whole', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'ideal', 'actor', 'play', 'part', 'guess', 'thought', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'dead', 'Sally', 'Field', 'woman', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'get', 'Josh', 'scene', 'chewing', 'be', 'done', 'already', 'have', 'Sam', 'Jackson.John', 'Elway', 'also', 'appearance', 'typical', 'Denver', 'celebrity', 'spotted', 'Josh', 'son', 'alfresco', 'restaurant', 'Dad', 'must', 'know', 'Josh', 'bragged', 'son', 'intimacy', 'greats', 'sport', 'Elway', 'winning', 'screen', 'presence', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'playing', 'champ', 'turned', 'hobo', 'reason', 'why', 'had', 'be', 'black.But', 'why', 'did', 'have', 'be', 'so', 'old', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'old', 'Jackson', 'really', 'boxer', 'question', 'saw', 'career', 'come', 'virtual', 'end', 'Christmas', '1953', 'movie', 'great', 'pains', 'establish', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '75', 'now', 'Jackson', 'role', 'had', 'just', 'gotten', 'out', 'junior', 'college', 'boisterous', 'rambling', 'mile', 'minute', 'never', 'flagging', 'energy', 'guess', 'had', 'hail', 'era', 'TV', 'could', 'be', 'lingering', 'doubt', 'identity', 'ridiculousness', 'demerit', 'strict', 'ratings', 'system', 'Beyond', 'asked', 'little', 'one', 'three', 'women', 'Josh', 'involved', 'Morris', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'Rachel', 'Nichols', 'ALIAS', 'would', 'make', 'best', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'said', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'down', 'ruthless', 'amoral', 'TV', 'executive', 'Showtime', 'who', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'ratings', 'number', 'one', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'horizontal', 'other', 'give', 'four', 'five', 'docked', 'notch', 'being', 'needlessly', 'preposterous', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'way']",Resurrecting The Champ

I hate to sound like Grandpa Simpson, but ""Get a haircut punk!""  I suppose the act of moving his bangs out of his eyes every five seconds gives him chic points and street cred, but I found it distracting.  Having said that, this is an excellent movie.  There are many things to take from this movie, and I hate to take anyone's enjoyment away from the movie by revealing my perspective on it, but the father/son theme rang hard in my head throughout the movie.  Samuel L. Jackson is, of course, brilliant.  He doesn't even have to scream the patented Jackson scream in this movie to bring you on board.  The thing about this movie that separated it from 99% of the movies of 2007 was the fact that it was a brilliant story first and a great movie second.  I am sure I will receive some derision for saying this but, I did not see the plot twist coming.  The reviewer said there was some problem with the pace of this movie.  I thought it was perfect.  I enjoyed the subtle morsel I was provided.  Step by step, aspects of the plot are revealed.  The characters are methodically revealed through repetition and revelation.  With technology and the enhancements of the craft that have been learned through trial and error, most movies move along at a clip that can be dizzying at times.  Resurrection takes its time and develops the plot and the characters and by the time the ending rolls around you receive the payoff.  As a story teller, I found myself so exciting by the continuity of the conclusion I nearly leapt out of my seat screaming: ""YES!  That is it!""

Josh Harnett also shows subtle acting chops as the young reporter determined to tell the Champ's story.

At first glance virtually everyone contemplating watching this movie, myself included, has already imagined this movie from beginning to end before popping it in their DVD player, certain that they are about to watch the gripping saga of a talented sports hero/celebrity reduced to the inexcusable ravages of homelessness, yet another lesson on the intolerance of our society for those it perceives as  ""failures"" generally and of the disabled specifically.  You are prepared, no doubt, to witness the heart-tugging saga of a poor soul whose brain (and/or body) has been debilitated by too many punches, and the heartless society that kicks him when he is down because they never had the courage to do so when he was in his prime.  Well, that IS a great story, and is an unfortunate true story for many ex-boxers (see Sam Langford, one of the greatest fighters of all time, e.g.), but that is not this story.The fortunate viewer is treated instead to a story about the complexity and relativity of success and failure, contrasting an admixture of various failures and successes and the complete lack of a nexus between material reward for true success, and the punishment of destitution for true failure.  The movie graphically shows the difficulty, and often, injustice, of applying such absolute final judgments as ""success"" and ""failure"" to an entire life, and how success/failure are in constant flux along the failure/success spectrum, not fixed finalities.This is Samuel L. Jackson's best performance.  His character is tragically aware of his state of variable reduced capacity, and even candidly rates it when asked how he is doing!  Jackson also hauntingly and extremely accurately portrays how the mentally disabled often have periods of concise awareness and focus, and during those moments Jackson's eyes change accordingly to reflect The Champ's heightened awareness.Jackson's great performance and a good storyline that you cannot predict or anticipate (and I have not given it away) are the two main reasons to see this very good movie.",5,Redefining Success and Failure,1223164800,"10 5, 2008",2008,2322,"['only', 'true', 'diehard', 'boxing', 'fan', 'likely', 'be', 'familiar', 'Bob', 'Satterfield', 'thunderous-punching', 'small', 'heavyweight', '1950', 'who', 'missed', 'being', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'hair', 'breadth', 'movie', 'actually', 'almost', 'nothing', 'do', 'great', 'fighter', 'first', 'glance', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'contemplating', 'watching', 'movie', 'included', 'already', 'imagined', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'popping', 'DVD', 'player', 'certain', 'are', 'watch', 'gripping', 'saga', 'talented', 'sports', 'hero/celebrity', 'reduced', 'inexcusable', 'ravages', 'homelessness', 'yet', 'lesson', 'intolerance', 'society', 'failures', 'generally', 'disabled', 'specifically', 'are', 'prepared', 'doubt', 'witness', 'heart-tugging', 'saga', 'poor', 'soul', 'brain', 'body', 'been', 'debilitated', 'too', 'many', 'punches', 'heartless', 'society', 'when', 'down', 'never', 'had', 'courage', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'prime', 'Well', 'great', 'story', 'unfortunate', 'true', 'story', 'many', 'ex-boxers', 'see', 'Sam', 'Langford', 'one', 'greatest', 'fighters', 'time', 'e.g', 'not', 'story.The', 'fortunate', 'viewer', 'treated', 'instead', 'story', 'complexity', 'relativity', 'success', 'failure', 'contrasting', 'admixture', 'various', 'failures', 'successes', 'complete', 'lack', 'nexus', 'material', 'reward', 'true', 'success', 'punishment', 'destitution', 'true', 'failure', 'movie', 'graphically', 'difficulty', 'often', 'injustice', 'applying', 'such', 'absolute', 'final', 'judgments', 'success', 'failure', 'entire', 'life', 'how', 'success/failure', 'are', 'constant', 'flux', 'failure/success', 'spectrum', 'not', 'fixed', 'finalities.This', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'best', 'performance', 'character', 'tragically', 'aware', 'state', 'variable', 'reduced', 'capacity', 'even', 'candidly', 'rates', 'when', 'asked', 'how', 'doing', 'Jackson', 'also', 'hauntingly', 'extremely', 'accurately', 'how', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'often', 'have', 'periods', 'concise', 'awareness', 'focus', 'moments', 'Jackson', 'eyes', 'change', 'accordingly', 'reflect', 'Champ', 'heightened', 'awareness.Jackson', 'great', 'performance', 'good', 'storyline', 'can', 'not', 'predict', 'anticipate', 'have', 'not', 'given', 'away', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'reasons', 'see', 'very', 'good', 'movie']",Resurrecting The Champ
