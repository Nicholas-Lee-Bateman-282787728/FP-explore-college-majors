That would be somewhat excusable if the protagonists sang well, but both Karita Mattila and Marcello Giordani were frightening in their squeaky voices and obvious strain with parts they performed.  Indeed once again Met seemed to excel to engage the fading stars, it seems, rolling on big names who can't sing anymore - and it is especially awful that this DVD is only from 2008, so quite new.Not only their singing leaves cold and rather shivering from displeasure, the acting in the Madrigal and Dance scenes is just so vulgar and low-taste; how can believe that Manon is a young and beautiful gentle lover, when this older woman behaves like a fish seller at the peasant market?  The whole production impresses with crudity and lack of any tenderness;  the singers were a caricature on their roles, and perhaps they would resemble bored libertines from Les Liaisons Dangereuses if they acted with more elegance. The production also lacks any imagination as it was done in the old traditional style, yet one can hardly imagine these people as refined French - but rather as American trailer park dwellers in disguise.In addition, the inserts with Renee Fleming also impressed with a TV soap opera style comments, which intruded in the fabric of the work - these should have been left to bonus materials, but not interwoven into the performance itself.This DVD is a huge failure - both as an opera performance and as a DVD production.  One could compare this with an earlier Flemish Opera production with Miriam Gauci and Jan Danckaert or with Covent Garden one with Placido Domingo and Kiri Te Kanawa for an evening of enjoyment.",1,"Manon de Merteuil, or The Met Dangereuse.",1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,1884,"['performance', 'DVD', 'Met', 'taken', 'new', 'step', 'reputation', 'most', 'atrocious', 'opera', 'house', 'rich', 'famous.It', 'roles', 'young', 'lovers', 'performance', 'anyone', 'younger', '50', 'was', 'disqualified', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'excusable', 'protagonists', 'sang', 'well', 'Karita', 'Mattila', 'Marcello', 'Giordani', 'were', 'frightening', 'squeaky', 'voices', 'obvious', 'strain', 'parts', 'performed', 'Indeed', 'once', 'again', 'Met', 'seemed', 'excel', 'engage', 'fading', 'stars', 'rolling', 'big', 'names', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'anymore', 'especially', 'awful', 'DVD', 'only', '2008', 'quite', 'new.Not', 'only', 'singing', 'cold', 'rather', 'shivering', 'displeasure', 'acting', 'Madrigal', 'Dance', 'scenes', 'just', 'so', 'vulgar', 'low-taste', 'how', 'can', 'believe', 'Manon', 'young', 'beautiful', 'gentle', 'lover', 'when', 'older', 'woman', 'fish', 'seller', 'peasant', 'market', 'whole', 'production', 'impresses', 'crudity', 'lack', 'tenderness', 'singers', 'were', 'caricature', 'roles', 'perhaps', 'would', 'resemble', 'bored', 'libertines', 'Les', 'Liaisons', 'acted', 'more', 'elegance', 'production', 'also', 'imagination', 'was', 'done', 'old', 'traditional', 'style', 'yet', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'imagine', 'people', 'refined', 'French', 'rather', 'American', 'trailer', 'park', 'dwellers', 'disguise.In', 'addition', 'inserts', 'Renee', 'Fleming', 'also', 'impressed', 'TV', 'soap', 'opera', 'style', 'comments', 'intruded', 'fabric', 'work', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'bonus', 'materials', 'not', 'interwoven', 'performance', 'itself.This', 'DVD', 'huge', 'failure', 'opera', 'performance', 'DVD', 'production', 'One', 'could', 'compare', 'earlier', 'Flemish', 'Opera', 'production', 'Miriam', 'Gauci', 'Jan', 'Danckaert', 'Covent', 'Garden', 'one', 'Placido', 'Domingo', 'Kiri', 'Te', 'Kanawa', 'evening', 'enjoyment']",Puccini - Manon Lescaut
1180429,AJOR7D8TIH3R4,B001DHE9KQ,bert1761,"[8, 12]","When I first started watching this DVD, I became very apprehensive.  The two stars are among my favorite performers, yet unpleasant sounds often came out of their mouths and their acting left much to be desired.  But in the third and (particularly) fourth acts, both Karita Mattila and Marcello Giordani were singing and acting beautifully.  I think it just must have taken them some time on that day to settle into their performances.  Both were producing some exquisite singing and very convincing acting.  Ms. Mattila's performance of ""Sola, perduta, abbandonata"" was perhaps the best I have ever heard or seen.  She sang with tremendous musicality and intense emotion, but the performance was not overheated and never did she sacrifice beautiful tone for dramatic effect.Of course, close-ups filmed in HD will do nothing to hide the facts that opera singers are typically old enough to be the parents of the characters they portray and must sing and must act in a way that will, in fact, reach the Family Circle, but watching the DVD is nevertheless a moving and satisfying substitute for seeing the performance live -- particularly when the principals (including the ever-reliable Dwayne Croft as Lescaut) are as good as they are here.",4,"Uneven, yes, but ultimately very rewarding",1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,1240,"['When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'DVD', 'became', 'very', 'apprehensive', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'favorite', 'performers', 'yet', 'unpleasant', 'sounds', 'often', 'came', 'mouths', 'acting', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'third', 'particularly', 'fourth', 'acts', 'Karita', 'Mattila', 'Marcello', 'Giordani', 'were', 'singing', 'acting', 'beautifully', 'think', 'just', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'time', 'day', 'settle', 'performances', 'were', 'producing', 'exquisite', 'singing', 'very', 'convincing', 'acting', 'Ms.', 'Mattila', 'performance', 'Sola', 'perduta', 'abbandonata', 'was', 'perhaps', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'seen', 'sang', 'tremendous', 'musicality', 'intense', 'emotion', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'overheated', 'never', 'did', 'sacrifice', 'beautiful', 'tone', 'dramatic', 'effect.Of', 'course', 'close-ups', 'filmed', 'HD', 'will', 'do', 'nothing', 'hide', 'facts', 'opera', 'singers', 'are', 'typically', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'parents', 'characters', 'portray', 'must', 'sing', 'must', 'act', 'way', 'will', 'fact', 'reach', 'Family', 'Circle', 'watching', 'DVD', 'nevertheless', 'moving', 'satisfying', 'substitute', 'seeing', 'performance', 'live', 'particularly', 'when', 'principals', 'including', 'ever-reliable', 'Dwayne', 'Croft', 'Lescaut', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'are', 'here']",Puccini - Manon Lescaut

I'm also a big fan of the Met's video productions of their many operas; not just the ones done recently in high definition, but those done on video tape since the 1980s at least.  They are well-directed;  thank you, Brian Large, director of this one.Overall, I enjoyed Karita Mattila in this production; I thought her acting was absolutely right for what is, after all, a stage production (not a film).  Her voice isn't perfect at every moment, but she won me over.I find tenor Marcello Giordani uneven, based on a couple of performances I've attended and when I've heard him on the radio, and in this video;  I mean this re: his voice and his acting.  I find it a bit painful to watch and listen to him.

1180432,A3MQACIN0QNYPK,B001DHE9KQ,Patrick J. Mack,"[3, 6]","For the most part this performance is smoking hot.  You couldn't ask for a better cast vocally. Karita Mattila has everything you want for this role.  I was afraid her Scandanavian timbre wouldn't mesh with Puccini but she's making a big healthy sound here and shows excellent attention to all the dynamic markings in the role.  Giordani is almost a completely different singer here from the one I've seen in other broadcasts.  He's so engaged and it's apparent he enjoys the role and working with Mattila.  They play with and off each other beautifully all the way through and his Act III outburst to the captain of the prison ship is very good.  He's the best thing we've got now as Domingo slowly fades away.Dwayne Croft is excellent as Lescaut with just the right sneer in his tone and leer in the eye.  The rest of the supporting cast and chorus are spot on at every entrance and really seem to be enjoying themselves.My biggest caveat is with the production which, is almost as old as I am. I'm an enormous fan of the designer Desmond Heeley and I think he's done some stunning work in the theater. This production needs a new paint job for starters and a serious re-think on the color scheme for the Paris boudior in Act II. It looks like green mold growing on glass. The first act and the last two acts are nearly perfect. The forced perspective on the Port of Le Harve is a knockout. You actually see them setting up the Act IV set and it's economy is pretty brilliant.  I have a feeling this is it's last outing.James Levine obviously enjoys this opera and he whips the Met Orchestra into a frenzy.  Seriously some of the most beautiful playing I've ever heard on any recorded performance.  Lescaut is early Puccini and it's written in a slightly disjointed way that ensures that the players and conductor have to stay intensely alert and you can hear it.  The fine attention to detail, the speed and precision of articulation and the overwhelming warmth that this orchestra gives over and over. They are the real stars of this production.Also Auntie Renee does the backstage color commentary and there's an amazing interview with the animal wranglers at the Met with some very surprising information on behavior of the horses.Pay no attention to the crusty old grandad who gave this a single star and complained about the age of the singers and then made the preposterous recommendation of the Covent Garden with Te Kanawa !  'Cause what you don't need in Manon is a sleepwalker who can't get her pulse above 40.

1180433,AXO05YATQPN46,B001DHE9KQ,"Patrick Maschka ""OperaGeek""","[6, 7]","For me, there is just something about Manon Lescaut that is deeply moving.  So I admit that I am hard to disappoint when it comes to performances of Puccini's first big hit.  Still, I consider myself to be pretty critical and picky, even if I get a little sentimental.  I personally think this version easily competes with other DVDs available, and not just because of the musical performances.I attended this performance live at a local movie theatre and was quickly drawn into the compelling, unrelenting melancholy of this opera.  It took me a while to warm up to Marcello Giordani's initially wooden Des Grieux, but his portrayal gradually relaxed and took hold, imparting passion and depth to the role.  His beautiful singing is full of emotion, even if it is imperfect (whose isn't?).  I had high hopes for Karita Mattila as Manon, and she does not disappoint me.  I have no trouble believing this is a teenager who cannot manage beauty, love, wealth and an untimely death.  Granted, not every note Mattila produces during this performance is beautiful, but that is not necessary to be effective and compelling in verismo opera.  Like most of Puccini's heroines, this is a treacherous role, but Mattila handles it well and her singing is lovely when it needs to be, which is most of the time.  Her characterization is what I find the most impressive.  Levine in the pit is thoroughly absorbed in the gorgeous music, and he clearly loves every note Puccini wrote, bringing to life all the suffering, sorrow, and remorse that fill the score.  My favorite moment: the soaring duet in Act IV where Des Grieux, Manon, and the orchestra reach a most thrilling, devastating climax.All of these recordings of the Met HD broadcasts offer so much more than just an audience seat at the opera house.  True genius has practically created another art form out of the genre, with everything from a birds-eye to a fly-on-the-wall view of everything going on, before, during, in-between, and after the four acts, both on and off stage.  We follow Maestro Levine to the pit and the singers on and off stage, and hear insightful and entertaining interviews given by the esteemed Renee Fleming (maybe the beloved soprano could have another career in broadcast journalism?).  We also learn in this production about how animals are trained to be creatures of the theatre and get glimpses of the detailed work that goes on when the curtain is down.Taken as a whole package, this DVD production of one of my favorite operas is a welcome addition to my collection, one that I will surely return to again and again.",4,More than just great opera,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,2596,"['just', 'something', 'Manon', 'Lescaut', 'deeply', 'moving', 'So', 'admit', 'am', 'hard', 'disappoint', 'when', 'performances', 'Puccini', 'first', 'big', 'hit', 'Still', 'consider', 'be', 'pretty', 'critical', 'picky', 'even', 'get', 'little', 'sentimental', 'personally', 'think', 'version', 'easily', 'other', 'DVDs', 'available', 'not', 'just', 'musical', 'performances.I', 'attended', 'performance', 'live', 'local', 'movie', 'theatre', 'was', 'quickly', 'drawn', 'compelling', 'unrelenting', 'melancholy', 'opera', 'took', 'while', 'warm', 'up', 'Marcello', 'Giordani', 'initially', 'wooden', 'Des', 'Grieux', 'portrayal', 'gradually', 'relaxed', 'took', 'hold', 'imparting', 'passion', 'depth', 'role', 'beautiful', 'singing', 'full', 'emotion', 'even', 'imperfect', ""n't"", 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Karita', 'Mattila', 'Manon', 'not', 'disappoint', 'have', 'trouble', 'believing', 'teenager', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'manage', 'beauty', 'love', 'wealth', 'untimely', 'death', 'Granted', 'not', 'note', 'Mattila', 'performance', 'beautiful', 'not', 'necessary', 'be', 'effective', 'compelling', 'verismo', 'opera', 'most', 'Puccini', 'heroines', 'treacherous', 'role', 'Mattila', 'well', 'singing', 'lovely', 'when', 'be', 'most', 'time', 'characterization', 'what', 'find', 'most', 'impressive', 'Levine', 'pit', 'thoroughly', 'absorbed', 'gorgeous', 'music', 'clearly', 'note', 'Puccini', 'wrote', 'bringing', 'life', 'suffering', 'sorrow', 'remorse', 'score', 'favorite', 'moment', 'soaring', 'duet', 'Act', 'IV', 'where', 'Des', 'Grieux', 'Manon', 'orchestra', 'reach', 'most', 'thrilling', 'devastating', 'climax.All', 'recordings', 'Met', 'HD', 'offer', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'audience', 'seat', 'opera', 'house', 'True', 'genius', 'practically', 'created', 'art', 'form', 'genre', 'everything', 'birds-eye', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'view', 'everything', 'going', 'in-between', 'four', 'acts', 'off', 'stage', 'follow', 'Maestro', 'Levine', 'pit', 'singers', 'stage', 'hear', 'insightful', 'entertaining', 'interviews', 'given', 'esteemed', 'Renee', 'Fleming', 'maybe', 'beloved', 'soprano', 'could', 'have', 'career', 'broadcast', 'journalism', 'also', 'learn', 'production', 'how', 'animals', 'are', 'trained', 'be', 'creatures', 'theatre', 'get', 'glimpses', 'detailed', 'work', 'when', 'curtain', 'down.Taken', 'whole', 'package', 'DVD', 'production', 'one', 'favorite', 'operas', 'welcome', 'addition', 'collection', 'one', 'will', 'surely', 'return', 'again', 'again']",Puccini - Manon Lescaut
