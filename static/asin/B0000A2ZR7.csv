Instead of focusing on ""alignment"" or conformity to the ""ideal"" pose, the instructor focuses on what muscle groups should be used to support the asana, an excellent approach, since the viewers will vary in their ability to ""achieve"" the poses.In response to the reviewers who claim that it moves too slowly: Heat can be built up in the body through either a quick flow or through long-holding poses. It seems to be a question of personal taste which road you take, but both will get you there.

The practice is done in a studio with a really ugly green wall and carpet. Maybe that is not so important for some but it was visually distracting to me with its ugliness!2. Although this video boasts on having 25 routines but in actuality most of them contain the same sequences in different order or in different combinations.3. Beginner and Intermediate practices are way too easy even for beginner yoga practitioners. In my opinion, the advance practice is the only level remotely challenging.4.

761464,A118DD1BQQX1WX,B0000A2ZR7,James E. White,"[32, 33]","I read a few reviews of this DVD concerning ashtanga teachers requesting their students to try this DVD as a change of pace to practicing the Primary and/or Intermediate Series of Ashtanga Yoga.  I can definitely understand why.  I tried a few of the work outs on the DVD.  The Sun Salutation, the Standing and Balance Series.  The  work has a similar intensity to Sun Salutation A & B and the Standing Postures.  The biggest difference is there are certain poses you feel as if you are doing forever.  For instance Chateranga (a.k.a ""Yogic Pushup"") is performed so many times and so slowly, a person can't help, but get stronger. This is a part that's kind of breezed through (at least I do) when doing the sun salutations when I warm up for the Primary Series.  This DVD forced me to pay attention to detailed aspects of the practice like this one.Ashtangis will definitely recognize most of the poses performed on this DVD (e.g. hand to big toe, hand to foot, triangle, revolved triangle, side angle, revolved side angle, etc.)  There are a few poses that are performed a little differently.  For instance the standing hand to big toe pose is performed with the arm extended out instead of having the hand on the hip, the intense side stretch is performed with the hands on the floor instead of behind the back in prayer position.The pace is indeed slow, but ujjayi (victorous) breath is maintained throughout.  I think this is the type of workout that will make a person who is used to practicing Ashtanga or any other type of fast flow yoga to slow down and focus on holding poses.  There are several levels of the workouts that a person can try (beginner, intermediate, challenge).  I tried the challenge and perhaps that is why some of the poses were held the way they were.  Despite the slow pace, I was certainly able to work up a sweat performing the workout.I would suggest this DVD for anyone who wants to try flowing type yoga, or a person who is used to faster flowing styles to try and slow down a little.  My only problem with this DVD was there would be certain points where the dvd would just stop.  I'm guessing this is a technical problem, which probably doesn't have much to do with the content of the tape itself.  Otherwise, this was a good solid way to do an ashtanga-type workout, without as many of the really difficult poses included and at a much slower pace.",4,Good change of pace from Ashtanga series,1092700800,"08 17, 2004",2004,2387,"['read', 'few', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'concerning', 'ashtanga', 'teachers', 'requesting', 'students', 'try', 'DVD', 'change', 'pace', 'practicing', 'Primary', 'and/or', 'Intermediate', 'Series', 'Ashtanga', 'Yoga', 'can', 'definitely', 'understand', 'why', 'tried', 'few', 'work', 'DVD', 'Sun', 'Salutation', 'Standing', 'Balance', 'Series', 'work', 'similar', 'intensity', 'Sun', 'Salutation', 'A', 'B', 'Standing', 'Postures', 'biggest', 'difference', 'are', 'certain', 'poses', 'feel', 'are', 'doing', 'forever', 'instance', 'Chateranga', 'Yogic', 'Pushup', 'performed', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'so', 'slowly', 'person', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'stronger', 'part', 'kind', 'breezed', 'least', 'do', 'when', 'doing', 'sun', 'salutations', 'when', 'warm', 'up', 'Primary', 'Series', 'DVD', 'forced', 'pay', 'attention', 'detailed', 'aspects', 'practice', 'one.Ashtangis', 'will', 'definitely', 'recognize', 'most', 'poses', 'performed', 'DVD', 'e.g', 'hand', 'big', 'toe', 'hand', 'foot', 'triangle', 'revolved', 'triangle', 'side', 'angle', 'revolved', 'side', 'angle', 'etc', 'are', 'few', 'poses', 'are', 'performed', 'little', 'differently', 'instance', 'standing', 'hand', 'big', 'toe', 'pose', 'performed', 'arm', 'extended', 'out', 'instead', 'having', 'hand', 'hip', 'intense', 'side', 'stretch', 'performed', 'hands', 'floor', 'instead', 'back', 'prayer', 'position.The', 'pace', 'indeed', 'slow', 'ujjayi', 'victorous', 'breath', 'maintained', 'think', 'type', 'workout', 'will', 'make', 'person', 'who', 'used', 'practicing', 'Ashtanga', 'other', 'type', 'fast', 'flow', 'yoga', 'slow', 'down', 'focus', 'holding', 'poses', 'are', 'several', 'levels', 'workouts', 'person', 'can', 'try', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'challenge', 'tried', 'challenge', 'perhaps', 'why', 'poses', 'were', 'held', 'way', 'were', 'slow', 'pace', 'was', 'certainly', 'able', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'performing', 'workout.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'try', 'flowing', 'type', 'yoga', 'person', 'who', 'used', 'faster', 'flowing', 'styles', 'try', 'slow', 'down', 'little', 'only', 'problem', 'DVD', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'certain', 'points', 'where', 'dvd', 'would', 'just', 'stop', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'technical', 'problem', 'probably', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'content', 'tape', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'good', 'solid', 'way', 'do', 'ashtanga-type', 'workout', 'many', 'really', 'difficult', 'poses', 'included', 'much', 'slower', 'pace']",Power Yoga for Every Body with Over 20 Workouts for All Levels of Students
761465,AXZ085P4SPXVL,B0000A2ZR7,"Just Breathe ""Just Breathe""","[5, 5]","I am a yoga instructor with an intermediate to advanced asana practice with a beginners mind.  I found this DVD to be extremely powerful and will help me refine my asana practice.  I teach mostly vinyasa style yoga classes that tend to move one breath / one movement with longer holds and pauses interspersed throughout the practice.  This DVD helps the student learn to flow with control and precision in the form of the asana.  Many of the poses are held longer than many typically ""power yoga"" practitioners may be used to and the flowing portions move slowly which helps encourage a controlled ujjayii breath.  I found myself able to move much deeper into poses that I practice daily with more attention to my alignment.  The verbal instruction provided very helpful words and imagery which I plan to build in to the classes that I teach.There is an interview (12 or 14 minutes) with the creator of the DVD in which she talks about ""Power Yoga"", what it means to her and that she understands many yogi's may have a different view and get frustration with the pace of the DVD.  Even if you are used to moving fast all the time I encourage you to practice with this DVD and slow down.  Learning how to slow down is something that many of us can benefit from in our fast paced lives.  Just because something moves slow, does not make it easy.  In fact, I felt that I had engaged and strengthened my muscles very much.There is an option on the DVD to view more information about the practices where they break down in greater detail what you can expect from each of the practices on the DVD.  This was helpful if you do not have time to do the full practice as most of us do not.  If I had to guess, I would estimate that I own close to 50 yoga DVDs.  This is one that I treasure very much.  While there are days that I am seeking more movement, there are just as many days that I need some stillness in my practice.  Be open to trying something outside your normal daily patterns and habits.",5,A vinyasa instructors treasured DVD,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,1992,"['am', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'asana', 'practice', 'beginners', 'mind', 'found', 'DVD', 'be', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'will', 'help', 'refine', 'asana', 'practice', 'teach', 'mostly', 'vinyasa', 'style', 'yoga', 'tend', 'move', 'one', 'breath', 'one', 'movement', 'longer', 'interspersed', 'practice', 'DVD', 'student', 'learn', 'flow', 'control', 'precision', 'form', 'asana', 'Many', 'poses', 'are', 'held', 'longer', 'many', 'typically', 'power', 'yoga', 'practitioners', 'may', 'be', 'used', 'flowing', 'portions', 'move', 'slowly', 'encourage', 'controlled', 'ujjayii', 'breath', 'found', 'able', 'move', 'much', 'deeper', 'poses', 'practice', 'daily', 'more', 'attention', 'alignment', 'verbal', 'instruction', 'provided', 'very', 'helpful', 'words', 'imagery', 'plan', 'build', 'classes', 'interview', '12', '14', 'minutes', 'creator', 'DVD', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'what', 'many', 'yogi', 'may', 'have', 'different', 'view', 'get', 'frustration', 'pace', 'DVD', 'Even', 'are', 'used', 'moving', 'fast', 'time', 'encourage', 'practice', 'DVD', 'slow', 'down', 'Learning', 'how', 'slow', 'down', 'something', 'many', 'can', 'benefit', 'fast', 'paced', 'lives', 'Just', 'something', 'moves', 'slow', 'not', 'make', 'easy', 'fact', 'felt', 'had', 'engaged', 'strengthened', 'muscles', 'very', 'much.There', 'option', 'DVD', 'view', 'more', 'information', 'practices', 'where', 'break', 'down', 'greater', 'detail', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'practices', 'DVD', 'was', 'helpful', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'do', 'full', 'practice', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'had', 'guess', 'would', 'estimate', 'own', 'close', '50', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'one', 'treasure', 'very', 'much', 'are', 'days', 'am', 'seeking', 'more', 'movement', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'days', 'need', 'stillness', 'practice', 'Be', 'open', 'trying', 'something', 'normal', 'daily', 'patterns', 'habits']",Power Yoga for Every Body with Over 20 Workouts for All Levels of Students
761466,A14FXA57XJNPDO,B0000A2ZR7,K. Haselmeyer,"[30, 32]","A few words about myself to make it easier for you to judge wether my opinion might be helpfull to you:I'm a Power Yoga Instructor at a local Hotel Spa Fitness Club. I'm strongly into Yoga since about six years prefering Flow Routines challanging strength a lot but still contributing to all aspects of Yoga. I practice every day. Beeing german my english spelling is pretty bad, sorry for that!About the DVD:If you wan't to learn the correct allingnment of the Yoga Poses in a very detailed and professionel way, this DVD is for you. If you want to challange you're strength like hardly ever before, this is for you. And even if you're a complete Beginner you will find the proper modified workouts on the DVD.I personally only use the challanging Level of the workouts (There is Beginner Level using props like a chair, and intermediate wich will be right for Beginners in good physical shape and there's the challanging programm). I personally skip the Beginning in the routines using straps and blanket. I guess it's ment to get your body and mind to the right point to start but in Power Yoga that is not neccesary and usually not done. The Sun Salutations give you all the warmth and stretching you need for any further Poses.The Slow Flow Style of the DVD offers some great advantages:First of all it allows you to be very very precise with the allignment of the Poses. With the Slow Flow and the instructors very detailed discription you really learn every aspect of the Pose. For Beginners to intermediate: Get this DVD to learn everything so you can use faster typical Power Yoga Flows and have proper allignment practicing.The second Advantage is: In the challanging version it gets incredibly tough because you hold the Poses so long! You stay in low Plank for to coomplete slow breath, you stay in uward dog for even a lot longer... This is very hard to do and you need a lot of strength. There's nothing challanging your isometric Power like this workout.I use the challanging Level ""Good Morning"" workout in the DVD often.If you skip the intro it lasts hardly twenty Minutes. In this time you do only three Sunsalutations and a few forward bends more. That's it. Still it get's you cooking even more like some one hour Power Yoga routines! That's because you hold the Poses so long. Imagine: in 3 Sunsalutations there's 9 Times Plank, 9 times low Plank (holding the whole body two inches of the earth)and 9 times upward dog, now think you are holding all these Poses between 2 to 5 very slow breath. Now that's Power Yoga!One other thing I discovered is that I feel even more totally refreshed and full of energie after doing this rather short routine than I do after some longer and faster routines. The Full workout in Challanging version is really very hard to do. You have to have a lot of strength and you need to be a long time Yoga Practicioner.There is many different workouts in all three levels on the DVD though ranging from 25 to 90 Minutes. There is something for every day, something for every level.I highly recommend this DVD. It is different but great. Even though I personally do the faster typical Vinyasa Flow Routines more often, and I myself teach a faster and dynamic style, I learned a lot form the programm and always enjoy doing it from time to time. See my listmania list on Power Yoga for all DVDs I recommend.I hope this was helpfull to you!Namast&eacute;!",5,"Great!

However, if you want to move slowly from position to position this is an excellent workout DVD.  Several of the poses I had never seen before and found them to be very beneficial for balance and strength. The slowness of the workout improves the experience of yoga. Barbara Benagh's voice is soothing and her instructions are complete. Some videos require you to constantly look at the screen to figure out what to do next or allow you to become complacent in the practice, in this workout she reminds you gently to keep the pose pure and not become sloppy.  The background music is perfect for a calming yogini experience.
