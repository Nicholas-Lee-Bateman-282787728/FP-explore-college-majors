1082613,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000RMJ4EE,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 1]","I absolutely adore zombie films and it's almost literally impossible to get me to hate one, I've liked some of the most hated ones of all time. I was impressed with what the filmmakers were able to do with such a small budget and I fell in love with the film the moment it began. I am disappointed by how it's being bashed on this site and feel that is doesn't deserve all the criticism it got. If you love zombie films this is certainly worth checking out, at least as a rental. This won't go down as the greatest zombie film ever made, but it damn sure is fun to watch and have a good time with it.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When a military experiment goes horribly wrong in Grover City and the town of Downey, it begins turning the people into fast-moving and vicious zombies. No one is safe and the group of teenage survivors must evade the undead or face a horrible death and try and find out what's going on and try and get to the morgue to find a serum that fights off the virus. It's a standard story you've heard before so don't expect to get blown away by any plot twists.MUSIC: The music is a bit of strange combo. It has some nice compositions, yet has some death metal songs incorporated into it which aren't so bad either. Overall, it fits the mood of a zombie film involving teenagers.ACTION: This is where Automaton Transfusion shines. This is one of the more violent zombie films I've seen as of late (Though not as violent as Planet Terror). This film is jam-packed with gore and blood spews a lot. Some highlights include: When a zombie grabs a girl's jaw and rips it off or when a zombie stabs his hand into a pregnant woman's stomach, rips out her baby and eats it as the girl is still alive and screaming, and let's not forget the chainsaw mayhem when a guy rams a chainsaw through a zombie's face. This film has plenty of limb-tearing, blood, and plenty of shootouts, and believe me it's really awesome. KICKASS!!ACTING: For a low-budget production, the actors are surprisingly decent. Sure they do slip up at certain moments in the film because of dialogue, but I liked them as a whole. They won't make you believe what it's like during a zombie attack, but they are likable.OVERALL: As a cautionary measure I'll go with a rental, but I just loved this film. To sum it up, you take zombies, throw in some teens, add tons of gore, lots of shooting and profuse beating of zombies, sprinkle tidbits of TNA, and then crank everything that makes these things awesome up several notches, and bingo! You have Automaton Transfusion! While this film has problems thanks to the grainy quality of the camera (But after a short time I was able to deal with it) and an ending that will anger anyone (Dimension, you better release a sequel), but as a whole, Automaton Transfusion is a very fun film to watch.THE GOOD: Tons of gore, lots of action, decent actors, good music.THE BAD: Grainy film quality, abrupt ending, some slip-ups the actors had with dialogue.",4,"GLORIOUSLY GORY, DOWNRIGHT CHEESY, AND YET TOTALLY AWESOME!  8.25 OUT OF 10",1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,2962,"['absolutely', 'adore', 'zombie', 'films', 'almost', 'literally', 'impossible', 'get', 'hate', 'one', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'most', 'hated', 'ones', 'time', 'was', 'impressed', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'small', 'budget', 'fell', 'love', 'film', 'moment', 'began', 'am', 'disappointed', 'how', 'being', 'bashed', 'site', 'feel', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'criticism', 'got', 'love', 'zombie', 'films', 'certainly', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'least', 'rental', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'greatest', 'zombie', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'sure', 'fun', 'watch', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'it.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'When', 'military', 'experiment', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Grover', 'City', 'town', 'Downey', 'turning', 'people', 'fast-moving', 'vicious', 'zombies', 'one', 'safe', 'group', 'teenage', 'survivors', 'must', 'evade', 'undead', 'face', 'horrible', 'death', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'try', 'get', 'morgue', 'find', 'serum', 'virus', 'standard', 'story', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'get', 'blown', 'away', 'plot', 'twists.MUSIC', 'music', 'bit', 'strange', 'combo', 'nice', 'compositions', 'yet', 'death', 'metal', 'songs', 'incorporated', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'Overall', 'mood', 'zombie', 'film', 'involving', 'teenagers.ACTION', 'where', 'Automaton', 'Transfusion', 'shines', 'one', 'more', 'violent', 'zombie', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'late', 'Though', 'not', 'as', 'violent', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'film', 'jam-packed', 'gore', 'blood', 'spews', 'lot', 'highlights', 'include', 'When', 'zombie', 'girl', 'jaw', 'rips', 'off', 'when', 'zombie', 'hand', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'stomach', 'out', 'baby', 'girl', 'still', 'alive', 'screaming', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'chainsaw', 'mayhem', 'when', 'guy', 'chainsaw', 'zombie', 'face', 'film', 'plenty', 'limb-tearing', 'blood', 'plenty', 'shootouts', 'believe', 'really', 'awesome', 'KICKASS', 'ACTING', 'low-budget', 'production', 'actors', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'Sure', 'do', 'slip', 'up', 'certain', 'moments', 'film', 'dialogue', 'liked', 'whole', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'believe', 'what', 'zombie', 'attack', 'are', 'likable.OVERALL', 'cautionary', 'measure', ""'ll"", 'go', 'rental', 'just', 'loved', 'film', 'sum', 'up', 'take', 'zombies', 'throw', 'teens', 'add', 'tons', 'gore', 'lots', 'shooting', 'beating', 'zombies', 'sprinkle', 'tidbits', 'TNA', 'then', 'crank', 'everything', 'things', 'awesome', 'up', 'several', 'notches', 'bingo', 'have', 'Automaton', 'Transfusion', 'film', 'problems', 'thanks', 'grainy', 'quality', 'camera', 'short', 'time', 'was', 'able', 'deal', 'ending', 'will', 'anger', 'anyone', 'Dimension', 'better', 'release', 'sequel', 'whole', 'Automaton', 'Transfusion', 'very', 'fun', 'film', 'watch.THE', 'GOOD', 'Tons', 'gore', 'lots', 'action', 'decent', 'actors', 'good', 'music.THE', 'BAD', 'Grainy', 'film', 'quality', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'slip-ups', 'actors', 'had', 'dialogue']",Automaton Transfusion
1082614,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B000RMJ4EE,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[2, 3]","""Automaton Transfusion"" is a mess, bottom line. But this type of film isn't meant to be high-quality, or even thought-provoking. It is simply a splatterfest. But fans of this type of film will enjoy, however perversely, the non-stop gross-out throughout the entire thing. It's as nasty as Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive,"" only without the humor. And make no mistake, ""Dead Alive"" is a very black comedy.One thing that works against this offering is the choppy camera work. The cameras are obviously low grade pieces of equipment, as is the film stock. Watching this is like having way too much to drink, and then trying to focus as you walk home. Anyone who has ever overdone it with the bottle will identify with this; even if you like this kind of movie, the constant jarring of the visuals is an extremely uncomfortable experience. Maybe it is intentional, but it really is to this film's detriment. But as I have said, the fan base of this type of film is of the mindset where low quality film, bad acting, and thin plots are secondary. It's about the on-screen carnage. And boy, does it have a lot of it! And this alone makes it a surreal experience.But the real self-administered slap in the face this movie goes through, is the ending; it has no ending. I made myself sit through this, just to have it stop, the screen goes blank, and a caption says ""To be continued."" If it has a follow-up, it would have been worthwhile to indicate on the box that it is a first part. In its present context, it seems they just ran out of money and/or time, and simply hung it up.Many reviewers on Amazon have panned this movie, understandably, but they seem to have expected more out of it. Just expect to see some of the most gratuitous, visually shocking scenes in any movie; don't read anything into it, and don't expect Romero's calibre, and see just how far a low-budget film can go over the edge.In all candor, these types of movies don't do much for me, not any more, anyway, but I sat through it out of morbid curiousity, what with the caption on the label that says ""...The best zombie film in decades..."" This is probably a reference to George Romero's ""Living Dead"" series, which is obviously the template against which these movies are compared, but there is no comparison. The scenes of violence and evisceration do go beyond the former's scope, but the movie is patently inferior.",3,For the hard-core fan only,1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,2384,"['Transfusion', 'mess', 'bottom', 'line', 'type', 'film', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'high-quality', 'even', 'thought-provoking', 'simply', 'splatterfest', 'fans', 'type', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy', 'however', 'perversely', 'non-stop', 'gross-out', 'entire', 'thing', 'as', 'nasty', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'only', 'humor', 'make', 'mistake', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'very', 'black', 'comedy.One', 'thing', 'offering', 'choppy', 'camera', 'work', 'cameras', 'are', 'obviously', 'low', 'grade', 'pieces', 'equipment', 'film', 'stock', 'Watching', 'having', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'then', 'trying', 'focus', 'walk', 'home', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'overdone', 'bottle', 'will', 'identify', 'even', 'like', 'kind', 'movie', 'constant', 'jarring', 'visuals', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'experience', 'Maybe', 'intentional', 'really', 'film', 'detriment', 'have', 'said', 'fan', 'base', 'type', 'film', 'mindset', 'where', 'low', 'quality', 'film', 'bad', 'acting', 'thin', 'plots', 'are', 'secondary', 'on-screen', 'carnage', 'boy', 'have', 'lot', 'alone', 'surreal', 'experience.But', 'real', 'self-administered', 'slap', 'face', 'movie', 'ending', 'ending', 'made', 'sit', 'just', 'have', 'stop', 'screen', 'blank', 'caption', 'be', 'continued', 'follow-up', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worthwhile', 'indicate', 'box', 'first', 'part', 'present', 'context', 'just', 'ran', 'money', 'and/or', 'time', 'simply', 'hung', 'up.Many', 'reviewers', 'Amazon', 'have', 'panned', 'movie', 'understandably', 'seem', 'have', 'expected', 'more', 'Just', 'expect', 'see', 'most', 'gratuitous', 'visually', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Romero', 'calibre', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'low-budget', 'film', 'can', 'go', 'edge.In', 'candor', 'types', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'anyway', 'sat', 'morbid', 'curiousity', 'what', 'caption', 'label', 'best', 'zombie', 'film', 'decades', 'probably', 'reference', 'George', 'Romero', 'Living', 'Dead', 'series', 'obviously', 'template', 'movies', 'are', 'compared', 'comparison', 'scenes', 'violence', 'evisceration', 'do', 'go', 'former', 'scope', 'movie', 'patently', 'inferior']",Automaton Transfusion

1082616,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B000RMJ4EE,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 1]","It's no secret I think zombies are about the lamest horror monster ever, so it's going to take a pretty spectacular zombie movie for me to go crazy over anyway.  The Zach Snyder DAWN OF THE DEAD does it for me, as does the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  Hell, even RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD entertains me in a dumb 1980s way.  But for the most part, I could take or leave any zombie movie or novel.  I'm just not interested.  But when it comes to AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION, I kept seeing the movie everywhere, with that blurb on the front from Bloody Disgusting.com calling it ""One of the best zombie films in decades.""Of course, if I'd been thinking clearly, I would have remembered that other than the Snyder movie, there haven't been any good zombie movies in decades, so being one of the best of nothing shouldn't have been too hard anyway.  Well, I found a used copy for about $5, so I finally broke down and just bought the thing.Including the DVD's commentary track, I've now sat through this movie twice, all 75 minutes of it (that's 2  hours of my life), and I'm not sure that $5 was worth it.The story is typical.  Life starts on a normal day, and all of the sudden, without warning or provocation, there are zombies tearing up everything and everyone in their path.  AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION could simply be a ""meanwhile"" to any other zombie movie, and in the end this movie meets another movie for one big massive lame zombie movie.Our story deals with a group of high school kids in Florida.  Chris (Garrett Jones, PENANCE) is our male lead, a stoner rock guy with a cheerleader girlfriend, Jackie (Juliet Reeves, ""Treme"").  On this particular day, Jackie is headed to a party out in the woods while Chris and his buddies, Scott (William Howard Bowman, DEAR JOHN) and Tim (Rowan Bousaid, JUMPING UP AND DOWN), are headed to another town 50 miles away to see a band play at a bar.  On the drive, Chris mentions they've been on the road nearly an hour and haven't seen any cars moving either direction the entire time.  When they get to the town, they see why.  Or at least, they see more of the same.  The place looks deserted.They get out of the car, wondering where everyone is, when suddenly a tide of zombies rounds a corner and comes after them.  Instead of getting back into the car they're still standing right next to, they run across the parking lot and into the bar.Meanwhile, back at the party, Jackie is having a crappy time.Back at the bar, Chris, Tim and Scott find the bartender is still alive.  They wait around a while, not sure what to do, then the three friends decide they have to get back to the car, which they should have just gotten back into right away anyway, but whatever.  The bartender covers them with his shotgun, finally sacrificing himself so they can escape, and the first place they head is back to Chris's house, only to discover Chris's father is dead.  So they go to the party in the woods instead, where they find the zombies have already devoured everyone in the area--except Jackie, whom Chris saves and the group of four wind up in what looks like a garage full of potential weapons, including a baseball bat, an ax, a shotgun and a chainsaw.  They rush out to face the zombie hordes.Tim gets picked up in a car driven by one of the cheerleaders he has a crush on, Simone (Ashley Elizabeth Pierce, THE GAINESVILLE RIPPER) but they don't get far before running into a tree, throwing both occupants down a ravine and into a lake, where they're attacked by a zombie who does a kid-Jason Vorhees on them.  Tim's legs get eaten off and Simone escapes without him.  She meets up with Chris, Jackie and Scott back at their high school which Christ insists, for some reason, must surely have survivors.  Considering school got out early that day when one of the students attacked and bit a teacher, I'm not sure why there should be survivors at the school, unless there were a lot of after school clubs that had meetings that night.What they find, however, is a gymnasium littered with dead bodies, which turn out not to be quite dead enough.  Scott is tired of running, so he powers up his chainsaw and heads into the zombie tide while the other three run away.  Simone is next to die and things look grim for Chris and Jackie, but they're rescued by an army officer who takes them to a military bunker under the school where their janitor, who is really another army officer, lives.Wait, what?Yeah, that was pretty much my attitude about this entire movie.  Do WHA???Listening to the director and producer commentary, it's clear they weren't setting out to make a great movie, they just wanted something with lots of action.  They even criticize movies with too much useless dialogue, claiming the script for this movie, at a read-through, only ran about 26 minutes.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, they sacrificed a TON of story by eliminating so much dialogue.  I mean there are things in this movie that make no sense at all, like if it took so long to get to the bar in the first place, how the hell'd they get back to town so quick?How come, when they get Jackie from the party--which they drove to in Chris's dad's car--they leave again on foot?  And how come Tim was the only one to get in the car with the cheerleader, when everyone was escaping together?The holes in this movie's plot could fit the Death Star.Writer/director Steven C. Miller (SILENT NIGHT) admits in the commentary to not being a very good writer, and at least he's honest about it.  The dialogue was ridiculous and this was very obviously the first movie this cast had starred in.  I'm sure they're all really nice guys, but actors . . . Umm . . .My biggest gripe with this movie wasn't the script, plot or even the acting.  It was the camera work.  Miller says it was a conscious choice to use a lot of shaky cam because in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, a person's emotional state isn't going to be calm, but erratic and frantic, as expressed by the shaky camera work.  I disagree.  I mean, obviously in that situation emotions are going to run high and your mind is going to be reeling, I admit that.  But I don't think the shaky cam was necessary in conveying that to the audience.  The action onscreen by the actors was enough to get that across, and that should have sufficed.  All the shaky camera work did, for me, was keep tossing me out of the movie while I thought about what a terrible choice the shaky cam was.The one things this movie had going in its favor were the effects.  While the budget didn't allow for a lot of really spectacular special effects, they made great use of what they had to work with, providing a dozen or more moments of awesome gore.  From a jaw being ripped off to several heads exploding and a fetus being ripped from a pregnant high school girl's stomach.  I'm not saying the effects were classy, but they were very well-done.I tried really hard to like AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION despite its subject matter.  I'm all for being proven wrong when it comes to the things I don't like very much.  I'm dying to find a really awesome zombie movie that proves to me this subgenre has any worth whatsoever.  And even though I said I liked DAWN OF THE DEAD, let's be honest; that could have been anything coming after those people in that mall, aliens, killer animals.  The success of that movie did not depend on the zombies, it was just a well-made movie in general, with great direction, acting and writing.  The zombies in that movie, as far as I'm concerned, were inconsequential.What I'm looking for is a great zombie movie where the zombies are just as vital a part of the story as anything else, something original where the entire point of the movie isn't just going in search of the girlfriend or kid that was left behind or spending the entire time moving from one location to the next in a desperate attempt to find shelter.  I had hoped this might be that movie.  The back of the DVD case claims this one ""shockingly redefines the zombie genre.""  Well, no, it doesn't.  A lame backstory and amped up gore does not redefine a genre.  I applaud the effort, but this isn't one I'll be revisiting any time soon.",2,Automaton Transfusion,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,8175,"['secret', 'think', 'zombies', 'are', 'lamest', 'horror',

(Fulci, Romero, etc.) it should have been the next great independent zombie flick.But.... cardboard characters and and a stale scripteffectively killed any sort of tension the movie should have had.There was no sense of dread, panic, or hopeless despair.Which is really peculiarconsidering how vicious the zombies in this flick were supposed to be.In fact, the undead didn't look undead at all!More like people just running around covered in blood.The story (or lack there of)takes a turn for the retarded about 10 minutes before the conclusion,And the cliffhanger ""To Be Continued"" ending,was the most insulting cop-out in recent memory.Especially when you consider the 75 minute runtime!!This mountain of shortcomings essentially nullified all the excelllent gore scenes, the films only saving grace.The final nail in this flicks cinematic coffin was the terribly epileptic camerawork,which I'm certain was done to make the film appear like it had a higher budget than it actually did.It was almost like the shutter speed was slowed down, so everything appeared to be unbearably spastic.(This technique would have been more effective if it was reserved specifically for moments of tension, and not used for the entire film.)In all honesty, it initially made my eyes hurt.So much, I considered shutting it off 3 minutes in.And as unbelievable as it sounds, the cinematography actually had me & my wife sick to our stomachs.

Yes, there is a lot of blood and gore, but it's nothing I haven't seen before, and what I assume was supposed to be the most visceral moment in the film came across as somewhat comical to me.  I also found it somewhat awkward that the filmmakers would suddenly decide to cram a storyline in to the film with about fifteen minutes to go.  It's as if they set out to make a film in search of a plot but chickened out at the last minute.  I guess they did achieve their goal of making a zombie film that starts out kicking it hardcore and keeps the blood flowing until the very end, but it came at the expense of both story and character development.  I only liked one character in the whole movie, and he ultimately let me down by going squirrelly on me.  As for the ending, I have to be blunt and say it totally sucked - a true WTF moment, and not in a good way.This film was reportedly shot in nine days at a cost of just thirty thousand dollars.  That being the case, the gory special effects are impressive.  It's actually too much of a good thing, though, because all the pointless bloodshed eventually ends up boring the experienced horror movie fan.  Even the title bugs me because I have no idea what it is referring to.  Maybe I would have found out if I had bothered to watch the movie again with the director/producer commentary, but I really had no desire to sit through this nonsense a second time.  I tried watching the making-of featurette, but after about five minutes I decided that I really just didn't care.

Supposedly released in 2006 (and now just making it to video), this gargantuan barf-fest is another shining example of why NO ONE takes horror seriously.The premise is--and this may be stretching it--a bunch of high school kids decide to have a party (out in the middle of nowhere), but before they get there, most everyone else in their town has turned into ZOMBIES!  The zombies of the ""cheap makeup/no makeup and very bad acting"" kind, natch.  But these just aren't your typical zombies; oh no, they can run and think, which is more than the producer/director of this movie could.  Oh, I think they could run.  And I'm pretty sure they could think, but ne'er the twain did meet.After arriving/leaving the slaughterhouse (formerly known as the party), the few survivors dash to the local high school (first place I'd go in this kind of emergency), only to find that no one seems to lock the high school doors and night and zombies DO need a place to rest...  The two survivors (oh, did I spoil something?) come upon two soliders--cleverly disguised as maintenance men--and are told about a horrible defense experiment which went horribly awry (don't they all?).  BUT, survivor A's father has an antidote and he and his girlfriend are going to get it, even if they have to do it by themselves.After they go out apparently the ONLY LOCKING DOOR IN THE SCHOOL, they are surrounded by zombies, and you then get a ""to be continued"" ending.

Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[3, 5]","I know, I know, this is low-budget zombie cinema so why harp on the use of ideas that have been used and re-used hundreds of times before?  In fact, why watch these type of films in the first place if you're going to be overly critical right?  True, that's a good couple of points except... at one time, independent horror films weren't only awesome BUT also original and scary.  I suppose every time I pick up one of these movies I hope to find something different or special... oh well, maybe next time huh?  Automaton Transfusion is one of the newest(seems like there's at least 3 more every Tuesday release day) independent attempts at the zombie genre.  Sporting the controversial(to me at least) ""running dead"" approach and a filming style that could make for Epileptic seizures at worst and mild nausea at best, Automaton Transfusion features a military experiment gone awry(shocking!) and a town overrun by the infected for our protagonists to escape from.  As I said at the top, pretty basic stuff, with our leads being an even more basic mish-mash of high school types(i.e. cheerleader, outcast, overweight loser, lone black guy in entire town, etc.) that you've seen plenty of times before.  The gore runs from good, to at times even inspired(a torn off lower jaw still has me wondering how it was done so well?) but is so overly absurd that it's never really gross, but it's still entertaining(by the way, the scene on the cover unfortunately never occurs).  The acting... is to be expected for this type of picture, not always bad, but never really good either(probably a little better than most of it's kind though).  The zombies actually come off much more like the infected from the 28 Days Later franchise, mostly just regular looking people, except covered in blood and running around biting the living.  The pluses about the film are that it hits the ground running(pun intended) and doesn't bore us with too much buildup and other unnecessary drama(it knows what it is), basically just running from one undead attack into another(in a nicely scant 75 minute package), and the scene where a zombie rips an unborn baby from a mothers stomach and devours it in front of her(I'm a horror fan... what do you want me to say?  Loved it!).  I had high expectations for this and maybe that's why I'm so hard on it upon my initial viewing(but maybe not either)?  For fans of newer low-budget and independent zombie cinema this should provide enough goods to entertain, but still is probably only worth a rental first.  *SPOILER ALERT*  I never give away spoilers in reviews but this one is big enough that I figure I should(not to mention I kinda wish I knew about it before buying)... the movie ends with a ""To Be Continued.""

1082632,A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,B000RMJ4EE,"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real""","[3, 3]","""One of the best zombie films in decades""...  ... ""The Holy Grail of true independent horror films""...These are the notations on the DVD cover.  Excuse me if I think ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Evil Dead"" still stand on the altar of independent horror icons.  In fact, ""Automaton Transfusion"" has none of the endearing qualities that make independent horror so compelling; original story, new twist, a surprise or two and perhaps a little hint of ""off-beat"".  I'm actually challenged to think of anything NOT derivative about this film.  That said; if you've never seen a zombie horror film then perhaps some of this film's qualities might work for you.  For the zombie veterans, you'll know where I'm coming from.  Let me dismember this film so that I'm clear.-SHAMEFUL LACK OF AN ORIGINAL THOUGHTHow's that for hacking into the jugular?  See if any of this sounds familiar to you;-Government experiment to keep dead soldiers fighting goes awry.-Kill by head shots and infection by bites and scratches.-Dead eat the living.-The zombies can run fast.-Use of a chainsaw to fight zombies.I would bet you're familiar with about a dozen films that contain these ideas.  I'm actually ok with that.  George Romero's Zombie rules have been used pretty much as standard guidelines for decades.  Fast zombies have been a trend for about the last 10 years or so.  Chainsaws have become a standard horror convention.  All of these ideas appear in plenty of good to excellent horror films.  The problem here is that those films added some sort of new twist to the genre or were wildly entertaining.  ""So what's the big deal"" you might say.-WHAT WOULD YOU DO?Empathize with the film makers of ""Automaton Transfusion"" for a moment.  Imagine that you've spent months, perhaps years, scraping together money so that you can put your blood and sweat into your labor of love; an independent horror film.  You gather a rather large cast of unknown but competent actors.  You actually have a large enough budget to pull off decent gore.  You've scored some nice locations and have a clue about film making.  At this point I say ""good for you Steven, Bill and Mark.  But why the heck did you waste your time with this derivative, unimaginative story!?"".  There is nothing about this film that makes me standup and take notice.  I've seen it all before with the only difference being that I saw it in better films.-VISUALLY SPEAKINGI found this film annoying to watch.  I don't know what technique was used but, whatever it was, it was over used.  I've noticed this technique in other films, usually used during action sequences to increase the sense of confusion.  You might know the look; intense contrast with a strange and jerky frame rate so that everything looks like it's moving in a frenetic and confusing way, sort of a low quality video look.  This film uses this technique throughout which just got irritating.  At least there is a good effort put into the gore which did at least add some intensity.  In case you were wondering, there is not enough sex or nudity to even mention it.-THE DVDIn addition to those totally misleading quotes on the cover there is a totally misleading image of a half zombie crawling around (which would have been a step up from anything else they did in this film) however it never happened.  The ""Transfusion"" part of the title doesn't make any sense either.  Besides my qualms with the packaging this is a decent DVD.  Included are deleted scenes, a rather rough ""making of"", some music videos, commentary track and a short film that was made in 48 hours for a film festival that lead to this film getting made.  The short film was actually more intriguing than ""Automaton Transfusion"".-TRANSFUSION CONCLUSIONIf you've never seen a zombie film then this will seem really intense for you.  However, if you've seen ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Evil Dead"", ""Return of the Living Dead"" or just about any other zombie film then this is a waste of time.  You won't get anything really new out of it and the story has nothing going on that will grab you as new or especially entertaining.  As a mild spoiler I will tell you that the ending is a ""to be continued"" which is just ludicrous since so few will commit to actually watching a sequel to a bad film.  In a vacuum it might have merit despite the annoying visual style.  However, we tend to watch movies in rooms filled with air.Story..........2.0 starsGordity.......3.0 starsVisuals........2.0 starsActing.........3.5 starsOriginality....1.0 starsAverage.......2.3 stars",2,EVERYTHING YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT FROM AN INDEPENDENT HORROR FILM.,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,4543,"['One', 'best', 'zombie', 'films', 'decades', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'true', 'independent', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'notations', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Excuse', 'think', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'still', 'stand', 'altar', 'independent', 'horror', 'icons', 'fact', 'Automaton', 'Transfusion', 'none', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'make', 'independent', 'horror', 'so', 'compelling', 'original', 'story', 'new', 'twist', 'surprise', 'two', 'perhaps', 'little', 'hint', 'off-beat', ""'m"", 'actually', 'challenged', 'think', 'anything', 'NOT', 'derivative', 'film', 'said', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'zombie', 'horror', 'film', 'then', 'perhaps', 'film', 'qualities', 'might', 'work', 'zombie', 'veterans', ""'ll"", 'know', 'where', ""'m"", 'coming', 'Let', 'dismember', 'film', ""'m"", 'clear.-SHAMEFUL', 'LACK', 'OF', 'AN', 'ORIGINAL', 'THOUGHTHow', 'hacking', 'jugular', 'See', 'familiar', '-Government', 'experiment', 'keep', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'fighting', 'awry.-Kill', 'head', 'shots', 'infection', 'bites', 'scratches.-Dead', 'eat', 'living.-The', 'zombies', 'can', 'run', 'fast.-Use', 'chainsaw', 'fight', 'zombies.I', 'would', 'bet', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'dozen', 'films', 'contain', 'ideas', ""'m"", 'actually', 'ok', 'George', 'Romero', 'Zombie', 'rules', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'guidelines', 'decades', 'Fast', 'zombies', 'have', 'been', 'trend', 'last', '10', 'years', 'so', 'Chainsaws', 'have', 'become', 'standard', 'horror', 'convention', 'ideas', 'appear', 'plenty', 'good', 'excellent', 'horror', 'films', 'problem', 'here', 'films', 'added', 'sort', 'new', 'twist', 'genre', 'were', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'might', 'say.-WHAT', 'WOULD', 'YOU', 'DO', 'Empathize', 'film', 'makers', 'Automaton', 'Transfusion', 'moment', 'Imagine', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'months', 'perhaps', 'years', 'scraping', 'together', 'money', 'can', 'put', 'blood', 'sweat', 'labor', 'love', 'independent', 'horror', 'film', 'gather', 'rather', 'large', 'cast', 'unknown', 'competent', 'actors', 'actually', 'have', 'large', 'enough', 'budget', 'pull', 'off', 'decent', 'gore', ""'ve"", 'scored', 'nice', 'locations', 'have', 'clue', 'film', 'making', 'point', 'say', 'good', 'Steven', 'Bill', 'Mark', 'why', 'heck', 'did', 'waste', 'time', 'derivative', 'unimaginative', 'story', 'nothing', 'film', 'standup', 'take', 'notice', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'only', 'difference', 'being', 'saw', 'better', 'films.-VISUALLY', 'SPEAKINGI', 'found', 'film', 'annoying', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'technique', 'was', 'used', 'whatever', 'was', 'was', 'over', 'used', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'technique', 'other', 'films', 'usually', 'used', 'action', 'sequences', 'increase', 'sense', 'confusion', 'might', 'know', 'look', 'intense', 'contrast', 'strange', 'jerky', 'frame', 'rate', 'everything', 'moving', 'frenetic', 'confusing', 'way', 'sort', 'low', 'quality', 'video', 'look', 'film', 'technique', 'just', 'got', 'irritating', 'least', 'good', 'effort', 'put', 'gore', 'did', 'least', 'add', 'intensity', 'case', 'were', 'wondering', 'not', 'enough', 'sex', 'nudity', 'even', 'mention', 'it.-THE', 'DVDIn', 'addition', 'totally', 'misleading', 'quotes', 'cover', 'totally', 'misleading', 'image', 'half', 'zombie', 'crawling', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'step', 'up', 'anything', 'else', 'did', 'film', 'however', 'never', 'happened', 'Transfusion', 'part', 'title', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'either', 'qualms', 'packaging', 'decent', 'DVD', 'Included', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'rather', 'rough', 'making', 'music', 'videos', 'commentary', 'track', 'short', 'film', 'was', 'made', '48', 'hours', 'film', 'festival', 'lead', 'film', 'getting', 'made', 'short', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'intriguing', 'Automaton', 'Transfusion', '.-TRANSFUSION', 'CONCLUSIONIf', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'zombie', 'film', 'then', 'will', 'seem', 'really', 'intense', 'However', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'just', 'other', 'zombie', 'film', 'then', 'waste', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', 'really', 'new', 'story', 'nothing', 'going', 'will', 'grab', 'new', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'mild', 'spoiler', 'will', 'tell', 'ending', 'be', 'continued', 'just', 'ludicrous', 'few', 'will', 'commit', 'actually', 'watching', 'sequel', 'bad', 'film', 'vacuum', 'might', 'have', 'merit', 'annoying', 'visual', 'style', 'However', 'tend', 'watch', 'movies', 'rooms', 'filled', 'air.Story', '.2.0', 'starsGordity', '.3.0', 'starsVisuals', 'starsActing', '3.5', 'starsOriginality', '.1.0', 'starsAverage', '.2.3', 'stars']",Automaton Transfusion

Visually, AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION is actually decent, with most of the money I'm guessing going to the gory, over-the-top special effects. And when I'm dropping descriptives like ""over-the-top"" when referencing a zombie flick, then realize that the filmmakers have exceeded even the generous leeway this genre allows. Munching on baby fetus is a mite too much. However, I did relish the scenes with the nasty back breaking and the jaw ripping and the cheek chewing. When it comes to zombie dining etiquette, Emily Post would be aghast.Thankfully running at a mere 75 minutes, AUTOMATON TRANSFUSION strives for that lean and mean sensibility, and it halfway achieves it. The action kicks off just about right away, with not much of a set-up (although, with a zombie flick, how much back story do you really need?). Oh, there is an explanation for this zombie outburst, but you have to sit thru most of the flick before you get it. And wouldn't you know it, it's yet another government experiment gone horribly wrong. Someday, there'll be a government touting not an ounce of hubris, and ne'er will zombies darken that reality.What's a horror picture without randy, frightened teens? This movie's writer certainly isn't willing to find out, and so he peppers in plenty of panicked high schoolers running around and screaming and crying, the more for the zombies to hear them with. It's not enough that these ghouls can smell living flesh. They also get auditory aid.I'm of the school of not actually minding that the undead aren't of the George Romero persuasion, slow, shuffling, stumbly. And, in this case, these fleet meat-munchers are that much quicker to dispose of these uncharismatic young actors, so goody goody.What I've learned from this film:- When zombies overrun neighboring towns, they'll fix it so that the streets and highways are cleared of ALL vehicles, which will then allow the main protagonist to get all suspicious because there's not one friggin' car on the road during rush hour.- A fat janitor will pass muster as an Army officer because he is chomping on a cigar, and this apparently lends him instant credibility.- Zombie flicks are governed by scintillating scripts which compel one student, while seeking safe haven, to stridently ask his buddy while in his buddy's garage, ""How far to the school?!"" Even though he himself is a local and he'd been giving rides to his pal in that same neighborhood since forever. Maybe he gets lost a lot.The story is barely one. To be fair, several of the teen actors aren't bad. It's the script that deals out flat characterization. You can distinguish the acting between most of the ""live"" cast and the zombies in that at least the zombies seem to go about their business with a purpose. The ones milling about, hysterically crying out: ""Oh, God, no!"" Yeah, those are the guys we're supposed to root for.The film gets extra points from me for having the chutzpah to end on a cliffhanger. No guts, no glory. Who knows?

You can not if that woman's b....I won't even spoil this because this is the ""shocker"" of the film, but is so far out there and was so unnecessary and could never be taken seriously that it should just be seen.Really, there is nothing much to this movie aside from the effects.

The story, for lack of a better word, revolves around a group of high school seniors that get caught in the middle of a zombie epidemic, and try to get out of town.  While story isn't really all that important in a pure zombie flick, it would be nice if we at least cared a little bit about the characters here.  We don't, at all, and instead just pray for their bloody demise.  It should also be noted that these zombies are of the running variety, which would mean that the action and scares would be aplenty.  Well, they aren't either, and the film as a whole just comes off as boring.  There are loads of gore effects, where most of Automaton Transfusion's budget seemed to go.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, as the gore effects are quite well done for a low budget flick, and are every bit as disgusting as any gorehound could hope for (one scene in particular will leave your jaw on the floor, if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about), and are reason enough to check out this flick.  Other than that though, there really isn't much else to Automaton Transfusion.  Maybe that's all fine and good for you, and if so then by all means check this out.

Bad dialogue, ridiculous situations, idiotic turns. Clearly, the screenwriter did not care to give us anything interesting.BAD ACTING - Horrible actors who cannot deliver a line.

I've seen shaky camerawork (example: the Bourne trilogy) but this felt like i was watching a youtube video on an extremely slow computer. The second thing I noticed was this horribly animated smoke that just got annoying. This was all 30 seconds into the movie. Why did i give this 4 stars? Well, the third thing I noticed was how AWESOMELY GORY this movie is! It's wonderfully executed too. It's quite apparent that they spent most of the budget on gore effects.The reason this is such a guilty pleasure for me is because i was able to look past all of it's low budget flaws just for the gore. Seriously, the first gory part is maybe a minute or two in and it doesn't let up until the ending credits.The bottom line is that yes, it's a very low budget film... if i'm correct it was made for no more than $30,000.

Son is wearing a Ramones presidential seal tee. This is a rare variety as normally the lettering is either all white or all red. This one has white letters and a red ""O"" in the middle. Garrett Jones stars as Chris, a high school teen with a bad Mohawk and a Dancefloor Tragedy tee, who have a song about tipping your bartender. Chris ends up trapped in a bar.

However it isn't that horrible, honestly it really isn't.  This movie isn't as wonderful as a ""Romero Zombie Movie"", 2004 remake ofDawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut), the firstResident Evil (Deluxe Edition)movie, or any gore fest by Lucio Fulci.This movie is also super low budget and the acting is about as good as a stale potato chip. The reason I enjoyed this movie is because it is what it is and it doesn't pretend to be anything it is not.  In other words, it is a gory zombie movie.  There is tons of blood, screaming, killing and violence.  There is a scene where a fetus is ripped out by a zombie, then eaten.  How is insane is that?  The zombies in this movie are also the ""fast"" type.  I also found the origin of the zombies to be rather satisfying. This movie is short and sweet (lasting only 75 minutes long).  In addition to the movie being short, the action starts rather quickly and keeps the action going.Some of the cons, the characters are rather weak and I didn't really care about any of them.  I also felt like a panty hose was over the camera lens entire movie, there is this fuzz and/or lack of focus through out the whole movie.  Perhaps a diffuser filter was used to promote a hazy feel, if this is the case I am befuddled why it was done.  The title of the movie makes no sense at all to me.  In addition the ending is a bit abrupt and somewhat comical.Again a very ""low budget"" movie that was filmed in parts of Florida (that were all too familiar to me).

There were some cool things like the guy in the water, buy other things made no sense. Why did the bartender have the door unlocked but he had a shotgun when the kids came in. Just a little thing but, wouldn't you lock it? Also, why is it that in so many movie, the zombies eat someone and the apparently let them go so that they can kill someone else? The one kids' mom attacked him at home, and I guess he broke away and run 50 miles to the party and then changed huh? Or the guy in the bedroom with the girl who got grabbed but apparently off camera broke away and then later chnaged into a zombie, although he must have changed, ran off, circled back to the house and attacked right?

On my HDTV being played through a HD DVD upconverter, it shows up as a smaller widescreen box on my screen. When switching between the other three DVD players I have, nothing changed....Now as far as the movie is concerned, it was good for what it was, a zombie splatter bloodbath. It wasn't nearly as bad as most of the reviews on here, however the ending did kinda suck (I won't give it away, you can see for yourself). I would have rated this movie between a 3-1/2 and 4 stars but I docked it a point for not being an enhanced presentation...So, if you could care less about the screen specs and are a zombie fan, I say give this a shot.

I ignored all of the bad reviews on here because sometimes a good movie can be overlooked due to people's inability to see the best in a film, that was not the case here.  This movie really needed something more to it, it was seriously lacking in all departments, except gore of course.  The end...well the end is what REALLY got me ticked.  How dare they end a movie so abruptly!?  Anyway, if you REALLY LIKE gore and don't require much more to be impressed with a movie, you could try this one.

1082664,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B000RMJ4EE,Zombob,"[0, 1]","Fast and furious zombie fun!!1) ACTING: The acting in this zombie opus was pretty good. While the viewer is forced to deal with the usual stereotypical characters, (the cool dude, the dork, the hot chick, etc.) the actors, for the most part, made their respective characters pretty realistic. However, I must mention that I thought a number of the actors looked a little long in the tooth to be playing high school kids.2) PRODUCTION: I think this is where there will be a lot of dissention between viewers. The blood and gore is plentful, and the action is fast and furious. The movie is filmed with a grainy film resolution, which combined with the jerky, fast moving camera movements and angles, made more that one scene difficult to see. The jerky, hand held camera movements did not bother me to the point of nausea, but I did occassionally wish for a NON shakey moment, just so I could focus my eyes. The zombie make up was minimal and looked more like individuals running around covered in blood. I appreciated all the homages to other movies that I noticed. It IS a zombie movie people, and a lot of zombie movies have already been done, so the chances of seeing something that we've already seen is pretty high. My biggest disappointment was the ending. The surviving heroes are on the run, they hit a dead end, (no pun intended) and...fade to black appears with ""To be continued..."" WHAT?!?!? If this was a tv show when next week I would be seeing the next part, or if the sequel to 'Automaton Transfusion' was already sitting in the can, waiting to be released in a month...okay. But to have an indie movie end like this when there may be no definite sequel in sight is a terrible way to end.3) ZOMBIES: Nothing really new here is brought to the genre, just more of the shamblers and runners that we've come to love.4) THE CAUSE: Military experiment gone awry...sigh5) NUDITY: A few breasts appear.FINAL:I enjoyed this movie. I have heard and read a lot of reviews where you either hate it, or love it. While I didn't ""love"" it, I did think it was a fun visit to the zombie genre. When you realize that the director made this movie for such a low amount of money, you have to give props where props are due. Hopefully, there will be a sequel to this movie, so that we can find out what happened to the survivors, and maybe some Hollywood types will give the director some ample cash for a serious budget.RATING: 3.5 out of 5",3,A review from Zombiefans!,1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,2435,"['Fast', 'furious', 'zombie', 'fun', '1', 'ACTING', 'acting', 'zombie', 'opus', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'viewer', 'forced', 'deal', 'usual', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'cool', 'dude', 'dork', 'hot', 'chick', 'etc', 'actors', 'most', 'part', 'made', 'respective', 'characters', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'However', 'must', 'mention', 'thought', 'number', 'actors', 'looked', 'little', 'long', 'tooth', 'be', 'playing', 'high', 'school', 'kids.2', 'PRODUCTION', 'think', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'dissention', 'viewers', 'blood', 'gore', 'plentful', 'action', 'fast', 'furious', 'movie', 'filmed', 'grainy', 'film', 'resolution', 'combined', 'jerky', 'fast', 'moving', 'camera', 'movements', 'angles', 'made', 'more', 'one', 'scene', 'difficult', 'see', 'jerky', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'movements', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'point', 'nausea', 'did', 'occassionally', 'wish', 'NON', 'shakey', 'moment', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'focus', 'eyes', 'zombie', 'make', 'up', 'was', 'minimal', 'looked', 'more', 'individuals', 'running', 'around', 'covered', 'blood', 'appreciated', 'homages', 'other', 'movies', 'noticed', 'zombie', 'movie', 'people', 'lot', 'zombie', 'movies', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'chances', 'seeing', 'something', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'pretty', 'high', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'was', 'ending', 'surviving', 'heroes', 'are', 'run', 'hit', 'dead', 'end', 'pun', 'intended', 'fade', 'black', 'be', 'continued', 'WHAT', 'was', 'tv', 'show', 'when', 'next', 'week', 'would', 'be', 'seeing', 'next', 'part', 'sequel', ""'Automaton"", 'Transfusion', 'was', 'already', 'sitting', 'can', 'waiting', 'be', 'released', 'month', 'okay', 'have', 'indie', 'movie', 'end', 'when', 'may', 'be', 'definite', 'sequel', 'sight', 'terrible', 'way', 'end.3', 'ZOMBIES', 'Nothing', 'really', 'new', 'here', 'brought', 'genre', 'just', 'more', 'shamblers', 'runners', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love.4', 'CAUSE', 'Military', 'experiment', 'gone', 'awry', 'sigh5', 'NUDITY', 'few', 'breasts', 'appear.FINAL', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'have', 'heard', 'read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'where', 'hate', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'fun', 'visit', 'zombie', 'genre', 'When', 'realize', 'director', 'made', 'movie', 'low', 'amount', 'money', 'have', 'give', 'props', 'where', 'props', 'are', 'due', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'movie', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'survivors', 'maybe', 'Hollywood', 'types', 'will', 'give', 'director', 'ample', 'cash', 'serious', 'budget.RATING', '3.5', '5']",Automaton Transfusion
