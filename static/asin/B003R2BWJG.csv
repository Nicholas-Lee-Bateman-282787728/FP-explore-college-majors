It presents a nice way to learn deductive reasoning skills with everyday &#34;mysteries.&#34; This was definitely the biggest surprise I've had in searching for educational entertainment.,5,I'm so glad I bought this,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,312,"['nice', 'throwback', 'educational', 'animation', 'lot', '3D', 'rendering', 'came', 'style', 'son', 'show', 'nice', 'way', 'learn', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'skills', 'everyday', '34', 'mysteries.', '34', 'was', 'definitely', 'biggest', 'surprise', ""'ve"", 'had', 'searching', 'educational', 'entertainment']",Busytown Mysteries: The Biggest Mysteries Ever!
1360054,AO3J40SKIP7CN,B003R2BWJG,Alice Bright,"[2, 2]","Our children enjoyed ""Busytown Mysteries: You & Me Solve a Mystery"" so much that we decided to purchase this one to add to our Richard Scarry collection. The videos are just like the books coming to life with all of the cute and colorful characters that children love.The mysteries stories on this DVD are light and entertaining, just perfect to engage preschoolers and also pique the interest of older children (we have an 8 year old son that loves watching, too). The music is just right - fun and lighthearted - no loud rock or obnoxious hip hop like you see in some children's movies and TV shows.My only complaint is that I wish they had not included the two episodes about a mummy and a lake monster. Why do people put subject matter like that on DVD's for young children? They can get spooked really easily!All in all, a great DVD, and one we enjoy over and over. Rest assured, if you love the books you'll loves the Busytown DVD's.",4,Our preschoolers and older children love it!,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,939,"['children', 'enjoyed', 'Busytown', 'Mysteries', 'Me', 'Solve', 'Mystery', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'purchase', 'one', 'add', 'Richard', 'Scarry', 'collection', 'videos', 'are', 'just', 'books', 'coming', 'life', 'cute', 'colorful', 'characters', 'children', 'love.The', 'mysteries', 'stories', 'DVD', 'are', 'light', 'entertaining', 'just', 'perfect', 'engage', 'preschoolers', 'also', 'pique', 'interest', 'older', 'children', 'have', '8', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'watching', 'too', 'music', 'just', 'right', 'fun', 'lighthearted', 'loud', 'rock', 'obnoxious', 'hip', 'hop', 'see', 'children', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'wish', 'had', 'not', 'included', 'two', 'episodes', 'mummy', 'lake', 'monster', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'put', 'subject', 'matter', 'DVD', 'young', 'children', 'can', 'get', 'spooked', 'really', 'easily', 'great', 'DVD', 'one', 'enjoy', 'over', 'Rest', 'assured', 'love', 'books', ""'ll"", 'loves', 'Busytown', 'DVD']",Busytown Mysteries: The Biggest Mysteries Ever!

1360058,A28FJ93TJSSQS4,B003R2BWJG,LMS,"[10, 12]",We picked this dvd up to entertain our 3 year old on a long car ride to grandma's.  This series is from the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation).  It kept him happily transfixed for many hours.  The dvd runs just over 4 hours and is divided into 10 30 minute episodes.  Each episode will contain a couple of mysteries.  THe characters use problem solving and logic to solve little mysteries around the town (one is example is a smoke alarm that keeps going off) . Very sweet little dvd - highly recommend for for anyone looking for a dvd for a child 3-5.,5,Teaches problem solving,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,557,"['picked', 'up', 'entertain', '3', 'year', 'old', 'long', 'car', 'ride', 'grandma', 'series', 'CBC', 'Canadian', 'Broadcasting', 'Corporation', 'kept', 'happily', 'transfixed', 'many', 'hours', 'dvd', 'just', '4', 'hours', 'divided', '10', '30', 'minute', 'episodes', 'episode', 'will', 'contain', 'couple', 'mysteries', 'THe', 'characters', 'use', 'problem', 'solving', 'logic', 'solve', 'little', 'mysteries', 'town', 'one', 'example', 'smoke', 'alarm', 'going', 'off', 'Very', 'sweet', 'little', 'dvd', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'dvd', 'child', '3-5']",Busytown Mysteries: The Biggest Mysteries Ever!
