273827,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301945301,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","As a whole, `White Palace' works rather well.  In parts, it is kind of a mess.  It is a predictable film, and it teeters on the `too romantic', especially that ending that starts to fray at the fibers of the film's core.  Like I said, when you think of the film as a whole it is an enjoyable and even moving film, but when you pick it apart it readily exposes its flaws.The gist of the film is that a younger, heartbroken man falls for an older heartbroken woman.  Neither of them really shares a common ground.  He is educated and wealthy and she is poor and crass.  But, they love to make love and they each share a horrible story of tragedy, hers trumping his by about a thousand.  Still, they are an odd pair that actually works because of their differences.  Their social standing (his embarrassment of her, her insecurity about herself) gets in the way of their happiness, but as with all films of this nature, love prevails.The film never really explores the darkness surrounding these characters in the depth that it deserved.  I just wish that they weren't so preoccupied with selling the sex but allowed the tragedy to take center stage (and I don't mean the tragedies of past but more the tragedies of present; emotional tragedies).  The film at times tries too hard to be an adult film, complete with trashy music.  Sure, the scenes are steamy, but this story deserved better than that.Spader is one of those actors I rarely get, and he is more stiff than anything else here (emoting depression does not mean resembling a log) but Susan Sarandon is a revelation as Nora.  She is snarky and driven and witty and seductive and believably crushed by her own past.  When she reveals her `loss' at the bar, the way she almost tries to laugh it off but can't hide the tear in her voice; it's flawless.  If the last scene had been eradicated from the film it would have played out better, but Hollywood is determined to hand out happy endings where they don't belong.  I haven't read the novel, but from what I read it seems to have been a darker tale, and that seems appropriate.  I just wish that Hollywood understood that `bleak' is not a crime.See this for Sarandon.",3,Halfway there...,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,2175,"['whole', 'White', 'Palace', 'works', 'rather', 'well', 'parts', 'kind', 'mess', 'predictable', 'film', 'too', 'romantic', 'especially', 'ending', 'fray', 'fibers', 'film', 'core', 'said', 'when', 'think', 'film', 'whole', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'moving', 'film', 'when', 'pick', 'readily', 'flaws.The', 'gist', 'film', 'younger', 'heartbroken', 'man', 'older', 'heartbroken', 'woman', 'really', 'shares', 'common', 'ground', 'educated', 'wealthy', 'poor', 'crass', 'love', 'make', 'love', 'share', 'horrible', 'story', 'tragedy', 'hers', 'trumping', 'thousand', 'Still', 'are', 'odd', 'pair', 'actually', 'differences', 'social', 'standing', 'embarrassment', 'her', 'insecurity', 'way', 'happiness', 'films', 'nature', 'love', 'prevails.The', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'darkness', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'depth', 'deserved', 'just', 'wish', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'preoccupied', 'selling', 'sex', 'allowed', 'tragedy', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'tragedies', 'past', 'more', 'tragedies', 'present', 'emotional', 'tragedies', 'film', 'times', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'adult', 'film', 'complete', 'trashy', 'music', 'Sure', 'scenes', 'are', 'steamy', 'story', 'deserved', 'better', 'that.Spader', 'one', 'actors', 'rarely', 'get', 'more', 'stiff', 'anything', 'else', 'here', 'emoting', 'depression', 'not', 'mean', 'resembling', 'log', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'revelation', 'Nora', 'snarky', 'driven', 'witty', 'seductive', 'believably', 'crushed', 'own', 'past', 'When', 'loss', 'bar', 'way', 'almost', 'laugh', 'off', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'tear', 'voice', 'flawless', 'last', 'scene', 'had', 'been', 'eradicated', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'better', 'Hollywood', 'determined', 'hand', 'out', 'happy', 'endings', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'what', 'read', 'have', 'been', 'darker', 'tale', 'appropriate', 'just', 'wish', 'Hollywood', 'understood', 'bleak', 'not', 'crime.See', 'Sarandon']",White Palace VHS

Her character is nothing but a repulsive-looking, washed-up, uneducated, trailer-park, trashy, alcoholic, and coarse old bag. She tries to be sexy only that she is never a one. The conversations between her character and Max are superficial and empty. I only wanted to see the movie for James Spader. Speaking of socioeconomic and academic ladders, Max and Nora are so far apart that it is impossible for me to conceive how the relationship is going to work. There is zero chemistry between the two, the death kiss of a Hollywood picture. Let's face it: Max is only addicted to the sex, not to her. Only if Susan could be replaced, the film might be better because James Spader is an excellent actor and deserves a better co-star to work with. The cycle of him with the old bag is this: have meaningless sex, find there is nothing to say,  discover imperfections and argue over them, have make up meaningless sex, find there is nothing more new to say, discover more imperfections and argue more over them, and perform more meaningless sex. The ending is an embarrassment to watch. There it is, I've just ruined White Palace.

It popped up again when I was researching some other movie and I was surprised at how positive the reviews were. I figured maybe I'd missed something and should give it another go. I did and I was happy I did. This turned out to be much better than I'd remembered.Set in St. Louis, James Spader plays a Jewish, hot shot advertising guy who has a tiff with Sarandon, who plays an older, waspish counter girl at the local burger joint. They, by chance, meet again in a bar while both are a bit buzzed and things change. They now begin a relationship which is very touch and go for many reasons. But (and this is a big but) they fill holes in each others' lives. They both experienced the death of somebody they loved dearly and neither ever really recovered. Now there is hope.This is a much more subtly nuanced film than I remembered. He's anal and a clean freak but learns to relax some. She has let her life go which shows in the disarray of her home. She now feels the need to get back on the stick and attend to the small things (like cleaning up a bit). There are some missteps and some hurtles that they may not clear, but I found myself rooting for them. I'd forgotten how it ended so it was almost like seeing it new.The performances and production values are all pro level so the viewer is not distracted from what is happening on the screen. Spader looks great and Sarandon is as delicious as ever. Their scenes together always have something going on, whether it be sexual or confused or confrontational, but I never got the impression either of them was ever ""phoning it in.""I noticed that one of the producers was Griffin Dunne, and he was never one to play the Hollywood Whore. He always tried to align himself with better projects, and this is no exception (except for maybe the ending which is pure Hollywood).

Likewise for Susan Sarandon who's good as well, though I definitely don't agree with the Amazon reviewer who calls this Oscar material.  Or I don't know - maybe this is what the Oscars are all about ... which isn't saying much for the Oscars.  This woman had no social graces at all!  First she backs old James into a corner over bringing her to Thanksgiving dinner, and then when he finally does, she manages to insult everyone at the dinner - and we're supposed to sympathize with her?  She was just rude. And while the party goers WERE rich and somewhat trite, no one was actually rude to her (except his mother - but this seemed to be her personality with everyone).  So for all the righteous indignation speeches made by Sarandon's character in other people's homes: A. I didn't beleive it, and B. it seemed misplaced.  Or I should say, I didn't beleive it because it seemed misplaced.  This is supposed to be the result of her inferiority complex for being a fast food worker and 15 years too old for James.  Still, the family should have scorned her more or really looked down on her so that her working class indignation could have seemed more warranted - as it was, I didn't buy it.  No one had time to justify her inferiority complex - she was too busy insulting everyone! Not what I'd call a moving performance.  But then she's not expected to be reasonable - this is 'drama' after all, not the girl scouts!And still, this wasn't a bad movie.  Predictable most of the time, yes, but the story does move along once it gets going.  And there are some good just-this-side-of-the-R-rating love scenes which give Sarandan time to make up for what she didn't show in Rocky Horror Picture Show..  which brings up another issue - while Sarandon isn't in the flower of her youth, she's still looking pretty good here, and she's no dummy either. BUT -  we're supposed to beleive this hottie's working at a burger joint at 44?

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[5, 7]","Max Baron (James Spader) is a nice twenty-seven-year-old Jewish boy drowning in grief and self-pity over the untimely death of his wife. When he gets shorted at a White Palace on cheap hamburgers he picks up for a bachelor party of his best friend (Jason Alexander), in a fit of self-righteousness, he returns to the hamburger joint to demand justice and meets forty-three year-old Nora Baker (Susan Sarandon). The rest is, as they say, herstory since this captivating film is all about Nora. She identifies with Marilyn Monroe (she has posters of Marilyn all over her messy apartment and reminds Max that she has a similar name as Norma Jean Baker). Beneath all her bluster is a woman living on the edge. She mourns the death of her only child, but Nora is a survivor.James Spader was thirty when he played in this movie although he looks about eighteen; and we forget that he is really the slightly  twisted Alan Shore from the television series ""Boston Legal."" Susan Sarandon recreates the role she did so well in ""Bull Durham,"" the older woman bedding the younger man, Tim Robbins. As the whole world knows, those two have been together since that movie as mate and mate. She and Spader engage in some of the hottest sex scenes you are likely to see that are every bit as torrid of those in ""Body Heat"" between William Hurt and Kathleen Taylor and Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie in ""Don't Look Now.""Director Luis Mandoki manages to turn the Cinderella story on its ear in the character of Nora and asks the question if love can survive this wide an age difference and class chasm.

I own and read that too, and although a book is ALWAYS deeper in detail, I was not disappointed with this film.Max Baron, a twenty seven year old Jewish widower coming from his buddy Neil's (Jason Alexander, pre Costanza) bachelor party, meets poor white anglo trash waitress Nora (Susan Sarandon) at ""White Palace"" restaurant.  He has come to claim six empty boxes that should have had burgers in them.  Instead he gets no burgers, just a refund and lots of attitude from a beligerent Nora behind the register.After being thoroughly depressed and feeling sorry for his loss more than ever,  Max gets drunk.  On his way home, he stops in a country music bar for a nightcap.  A few gulps later, he is spotted by a cigarette puffing  drunken Nora, attracted to Max, she is therefore, swilling AND willing.  I don't think ANYONE would actually need drinks to find Spader attractive though.After Max relents and lets Nora stay and have a drink, despite being surlier earlier...they end up back at her place.  It is then, that two consenting, inebriated adults begin their December/May romance.What Max had intended as one night stand, somehow ends up being true love, despite the ethnic differences, social status disparity, and disapproving friends and family.  Max and Nora make-up, and break-up, and come to a crossroads in their relationship, but true love conquers all.All the performances from the leads are well executed, you feel for Max.  His analogy at a party, where his friends are trying to find him a more suitable mate is terrific.  When asked if he likes the girl,  Max's says, ""There's No dust in her dustbuster!""  This sums up his feelings perfectly.  He doesn't WANT a perfect young girl, he wants imperfect older Nora.I found this to be a warm, enjoyable romantic comedy/drama.  Luis Mandoki did a fine directing job, and the script adaption was fine in telling the story.  Jason Alexander was good as Neil, Max's best friend.  There were also many good minor roles of various friends in Max's circle of snobs that really made you root for Nora all the more.  A fun cameo was Kathy Bates in a small role as Spaders boss.All in all, a winner that is definitely worth seeing, and adding to the romance selections in your film collection.",5,Romance Can Come When You Least Expect It.,1014076800,"02 19, 2002",2002,2377,"['James', 'Spader', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'entertaining', 'adaption', 'Glenn', 'Savan', 'novel', 'own', 'read', 'too', 'book', 'ALWAYS', 'deeper', 'detail', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'film.Max', 'Baron', 'twenty', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'Jewish', 'widower', 'coming', 'buddy', 'Neil', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'pre', 'Costanza', 'bachelor', 'party', 'meets', 'poor', 'white', 'anglo', 'trash', 'waitress', 'Nora', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'White', 'Palace', 'restaurant', 'come', 'claim', 'six', 'empty', 'boxes', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'burgers', 'Instead', 'burgers', 'just', 'refund', 'lots', 'attitude', 'beligerent', 'Nora', 'register.After', 'being', 'thoroughly', 'depressed', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'loss', 'more', 'ever', 'Max', 'drunk', 'way', 'home', 'country', 'music', 'bar', 'nightcap', 'few', 'gulps', 'later', 'spotted', 'cigarette', 'puffing', 'drunken', 'Nora', 'attracted', 'Max', 'therefore', 'swilling', 'willing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ANYONE', 'would', 'actually', 'need', 'drinks', 'find', 'Spader', 'attractive', 'though.After', 'Max', 'relents', 'Nora', 'stay', 'have', 'drink', 'being', 'surlier', 'earlier', 'end', 'up', 'back', 'place', 'then', 'two', 'consenting', 'inebriated', 'adults', 'begin', 'December/May', 'romance.What', 'Max', 'had', 'intended', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'somehow', 'up', 'being', 'true', 'love', 'ethnic', 'differences', 'social', 'status', 'disparity', 'disapproving', 'friends', 'family', 'Max', 'Nora', 'make-up', 'break-up', 'come', 'crossroads', 'relationship', 'true', 'love', 'conquers', 'all.All', 'performances', 'leads', 'are', 'well', 'executed', 'feel', 'Max', 'analogy', 'party', 'where', 'friends', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'more', 'suitable', 'mate', 'terrific', 'When', 'asked', 'girl', 'Max', 'dust', 'dustbuster', 'up', 'feelings', 'perfectly', ""n't"", 'WANT', 'perfect', 'young', 'girl', 'imperfect', 'older', 'Nora.I', 'found', 'be', 'warm', 'enjoyable', 'romantic', 'comedy/drama', 'Luis', 'Mandoki', 'did', 'fine', 'directing', 'job', 'script', 'adaption', 'was', 'fine', 'telling', 'story', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'was', 'good', 'Neil', 'Max', 'best', 'friend', 'were', 'also', 'many', 'good', 'minor', 'roles', 'various', 'friends', 'Max', 'circle', 'snobs', 'really', 'made', 'root', 'Nora', 'more', 'fun', 'cameo', 'was', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'small', 'role', 'Spaders', 'boss.All', 'winner', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'adding', 'romance', 'selections', 'film', 'collection']",White Palace VHS

I saw it in 1991 and I loved it immensely; I watched it again a few days ago and I loved it even more.White Palace has the freshness, beauty, truthfulness and steadyness of a true classic. The direction and acting are incredible; Susan Sarandon and James Spader not only give their best, they have a fantastic chemistry; Sarandon's presence is electrifying; Spader's natural reserve and beauty are fascinating. The progression of the story is marked by meaningful silences, excellent music, mesmerizing close-ups of Spader and Sarandon. The cinematography is superb.The only detail I didn't really like is the very last scene, more precisely 'the kiss on the table' one: it is a bit too histrionic and artificial for me, not consistent with Max' character and behaviour--too bad the producers had to give in to the Hollywood policy and change the ending. The cheap theatricality of this last scene is quite embarassing and it's a shame we cannot see the original ending (bonus tracks). This would be a real treat.

273858,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,6301945301,Phil S.,"[1, 5]","Susan Sarandon gives such a strong performance that the ""TV Movie"" quality of her vehicle is secondary. She doesn't transform the material; she just acts brilliantly, and manages to convey her personal enthusiasm for the sensuous and complex character. Interesting that she doesn't assert the ""Older Woman mystique"" here. That pupil dilating element flows naturally.Of course, in the proverbial real world, her beauty and wit would have gotten her at least to the Management level in her work setting - a place (in the movie world) Max Baron (played in low gear by James Spader) would deem as common - revealed by his presumptuous confrontation over the missing burgers.And, so, the socially/occupationally upwardly mobile White Collar Max makes a date with the stagnant but self-aware and content Blue Collar Nora.Sarandon's approach is so subtle here that the viewer is challenged to decide if Nora's love of Max is real, or at least as deep as his is for her. Or are they merely joyful that a void has been filled? The electric shock of their passion is felt by the viewer - I'm reminded of movies like ""The Owl And The Pussycat"", ""Bodyheat"", or ""Atlantic City"", Sarandon's gem of a movie in which she plays a somewhat similiar role, though one of insecurity and naivete - when I reflect on this film. The relationships in those three efforts are essentially *wrong*, also.Max brings Nora home for a big family dinner. The aristocratc guests do not exactly give her a warm welcome. Sarandon maintains her dignity while she is baited and while Max can't seem to find anything creative to say or do, as his Advertising background fails him in the clinch.Jason Alexander has a supporting role - none of his post-1994 ""Seinfeld"" energy is found amongst these celluloid frames.",3,Susan Sarandon is great; movie isn't,1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,1775,"['Susan', 'Sarandon', 'strong', 'performance', 'TV', 'Movie', 'quality', 'vehicle', 'secondary', ""n't"", 'transform', 'material', 'just', 'brilliantly', 'convey', 'personal', 'enthusiasm', 'sensuous', 'complex', 'character', 'Interesting', ""n't"", 'assert', 'Older', 'Woman', 'mystique', 'here', 'pupil', 'dilating', 'element', 'naturally.Of', 'course', 'proverbial', 'real', 'world', 'beauty', 'wit', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'least', 'Management', 'level', 'work', 'setting', 'place', 'movie', 'world', 'Max', 'Baron', 'played', 'low', 'gear', 'James', 'Spader', 'would', 'deem', 'common', 'revealed', 'presumptuous', 'confrontation', 'missing', 'burgers.And', 'so', 'socially/occupationally', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'White', 'Collar', 'Max', 'date', 'stagnant', 'self-aware', 'content', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Nora.Sarandon', 'approach', 'so', 'subtle', 'here', 'viewer', 'challenged', 'decide', 'Nora', 'love', 'Max', 'real', 'least', 'as', 'deep', 'are', 'merely', 'joyful', 'void', 'been', 'filled', 'electric', 'shock', 'passion', 'felt', 'viewer', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'movies', 'Owl', 'Pussycat', 'Bodyheat', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'Sarandon', 'gem', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'similiar', 'role', 'one', 'insecurity', 'naivete', 'when', 'reflect', 'film', 'relationships', 'three', 'efforts', 'are', 'essentially', '*wrong*', 'also.Max', 'brings', 'Nora', 'home', 'big', 'family', 'dinner', 'aristocratc', 'guests', 'do', 'not', 'exactly', 'give', 'warm', 'welcome', 'Sarandon', 'dignity', 'baited', 'Max', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'anything', 'creative', 'say', 'do', 'Advertising', 'background', 'clinch.Jason', 'Alexander', 'supporting', 'role', 'none', 'post-1994', 'Seinfeld', 'energy', 'found', 'celluloid', 'frames']",White Palace VHS

273861,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,6301945301,S. Schell,"[13, 16]","Luis Mandoki seems to be akin to dour and depressing pieces (Message In A Bottle, When A Man Loves A Woman) but works his somber mystique to greater effect in this undervalued ditty of opposites attracting.  This improbable tale of true love begins with 27-year-old Max Baron (Spader) wallowing in self-pity over the recent death of his wife and suffering the annoyance of bad service from a scanty burger joint called White Palace (think White Castle and you have a good idea of how scanty they are).  Retreating from a friend's bachelor party to haggle over six missing burgers, he harries a tired gal named Nora Baker and receives a gruff riposte from the steely waitress.  Later that night after the party favors and burgers have run out, Max solemnly retreats to a local bar for a drink and finds Nora hunched over the counter swigging vodka tonics and eyeing him like a scrumptious prize.  He rebuffs her every blatant sexual advance, but all the same she follows him outside begging him for a ride home.  They arrive at her cluttered domicile and Max is immediately sickened by the filth that surrounds him, insisting that he is okay to drive himself home.  Nora is adamant about him staying the night and the minute he is asleep, her lusty impulses take over and she seduces her inebriated guest right on her couch.Thus begins the unlikely and somewhat clich&eacute;d rapport between a wealthy Jewish widower and a 40-something gal from the wrong side of the tracks with a closet full of skeletons.  The two main characters don't really have any compatibility other than their sympathies for the others' personal tragedy (of Nora's, you will find the truth about later on in the movie).  Little else draws them to one another besides their ravenous sexual appetites.  Sarandon and Spader certainly have the chemistry needed to make their debatable affair authentic, but when I discovered the original conclusion of the novel the film was based upon, it made more sense to me.  The finale chosen for this adaptation is the more favored because it is the typical happy ending that most people crave; it's just not realistic.  It evokes the warm fuzzy feelings we all like to get from our entertainment, but it mocks the truth and the author's hard work.  I admired it for its playfulness but when I think of how it could've ended, I would've valued it more as a work of art.Sarandon, though far past the age most film czars would consider the closing stages of an actress' wondrous opportunities, still has the ability to carry a movie all by herself, no matter whether she is the story's victor or casualty.  It is here that she proves it the most, no matter how celebrated other roles may be (Bull Durham, Dead Man Walking, etc.).  As an over-the-hill, working-class sexpot, Sarandon displays more of an understanding and connection to her character than any she has portrayed previously, due greatly to the fact that she IS a seasoned actress.  Because of this, she is the strongest, worthiest and most memorable performance in this film, rising above Spader's almost unbearable morbidity and angst-ridden deportment.  Eileen Brennan is of mild interest as Nora's roving clairvoyant sibling Judy.  Jason Alexander barely shows any sign of the spunk he would create for his character on ""Seinfeld"" as Neil, Max's betrothed buddy.  Kathy Bates has a small but enjoyable cameo as Max's friendly colleague and Rachel Chagall is so ebullient it hurts us to watch.Overall, ""White Palace"" is an enjoyable film despite its faults and has a great rewatchability factor because of Spader's and Sarandon's overt and plausible lustiness towards each other and the smart interpretation of their characters.  Fans looking to get a glimpse of either Spader or Sarandon in the buff, this is the film to watch.  There's a valiant but dignified show of skin in selected scenes and you will see why Sarandon is considered such an admirable role model for women her age.",4,"Sex, Lies and a Hamburger Joint",980467200,"01 26, 2001",2001,3959,"['Luis', 'Mandoki', 'be', 'akin', 'dour', 'depressing', 'pieces', 'Message', 'A', 'Bottle', 'When', 'Man', 'A', 'Woman', 'somber', 'mystique', 'greater', 'effect', 'undervalued', 'ditty', 'opposites', 'attracting', 'improbable', 'tale', 'true', 'love', '27-year-old', 'Max', 'Baron', 'Spader', 'wallowing', 'self-pity', 'recent', 'death', 'wife', 'suffering', 'annoyance', 'bad', 'service', 'scanty', 'burger', 'joint', 'called', 'White', 'Palace', 'think', 'White', 'Castle', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'how', 'scanty', 'are', 'Retreating', 'friend', 'bachelor', 'party', 'haggle', 'six', 'missing', 'burgers', 'tired', 'gal', 'named', 'Nora', 'Baker', 'gruff', 'riposte', 'steely', 'waitress', 'Later', 'night', 'party', 'favors', 'burgers', 'have', 'run', 'out', 'Max', 'solemnly', 'local', 'bar', 'drink', 'Nora', 'hunched', 'counter', 'swigging', 'vodka', 'tonics', 'eyeing', 'scrumptious', 'prize', 'blatant', 'sexual', 'advance', 'same', 'begging', 'ride', 'home', 'arrive', 'cluttered', 'domicile', 'Max', 'immediately', 'sickened', 'filth', 'insisting', 'okay', 'drive', 'home', 'Nora', 'adamant', 'staying', 'night', 'minute', 'asleep', 'lusty', 'impulses', 'take', 'inebriated', 'guest', 'right', 'couch.Thus', 'unlikely', 'somewhat', 'clich', 'eacute', 'rapport', 'wealthy', 'Jewish', 'widower', '40-something', 'gal', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'closet', 'full', 'skeletons', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'compatibility', 'other', 'sympathies', 'others', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'Nora', 'will', 'find', 'truth', 'later', 'movie', 'Little', 'else', 'one', 'ravenous', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'Sarandon', 'Spader', 'certainly', 'have', 'chemistry', 'needed', 'make', 'debatable', 'affair', 'authentic', 'when', 'discovered', 'original', 'conclusion', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'finale', 'chosen', 'adaptation', 'more', 'favored', 'typical', 'happy', 'ending', 'most', 'people', 'crave', 'just', 'not', 'realistic', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feelings', 'like', 'get', 'entertainment', 'truth', 'author', 'hard', 'work', 'admired', 'playfulness', 'when', 'think', 'how', 'could', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'would', ""'ve"", 'valued', 'more', 'work', 'art.Sarandon', 'far', 'age', 'most', 'film', 'czars', 'would', 'consider', 'closing', 'stages', 'actress', 'wondrous', 'opportunities', 'still', 'ability', 'carry', 'movie', 'matter', 'story', 'victor', 'casualty', 'here', 'most', 'matter', 'how', 'celebrated', 'other', 'roles', 'may', 'be', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'etc.', 'over-the-hill', 'working-class', 'sexpot', 'Sarandon', 'more', 'understanding', 'connection', 'character', 'portrayed', 'previously', 'due', 'greatly', 'fact', 'seasoned', 'actress', 'strongest', 'worthiest', 'most', 'memorable', 'performance', 'film', 'rising', 'Spader', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'morbidity', 'angst-ridden', 'deportment', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'mild', 'interest', 'Nora', 'roving', 'clairvoyant', 'sibling', 'Judy', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'barely', 'sign', 'spunk', 'would', 'create', 'character', 'Seinfeld', 'Neil', 'Max', 'betrothed', 'buddy', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'small', 'enjoyable', 'cameo', 'Max', 'friendly', 'colleague', 'Rachel', 'Chagall', 'so', 'ebullient', 'watch.Overall', 'White', 'Palace', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'faults', 'great', 'rewatchability', 'factor', 'Spader', 'Sarandon', 'overt', 'plausible', 'lustiness', 'towards', 'other', 'smart', 'interpretation', 'characters', 'Fans', 'looking', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Spader', 'Sarandon', 'buff', 'film', 'watch', 'valiant', 'dignified', 'show', 'skin', 'selected', 'scenes', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'Sarandon', 'considered', 'such', 'admirable', 'role', 'model', 'women', 'age']",White Palace VHS
