980990,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B000F0UUIC,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 3]","Photographed by Gregg Toland, scripted by playwright Eugene O'Neill from four of his works and directed by the great John Ford, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME is not your standard naval/war movie.Released during the early days of WWII, it's the story of a freighter crew's joys and their struggle for survival as the S.S. Glencairn plies treacherous enemy-infested waters of the North Atlantic. They travel unescorted with a load of ammunition bound for England. A crewman (Ian Hunter) is suspected of being a spy, but the accusations of others would lead to regrets all around. An after-hours carouse at a lowly portside tavern also has unexpected consequences.When he speaks at all, John Wayne, fresh from his triumph with Ford in STAGECOACH (1939)  (VHS)  (DVD)  uses a pronounced Swedish accent in his portrayal of Ole. Thomas Mitchell, who got the Oscar for that same film is most prominent here, as is Barry Fitzgerald. Of the half-dozen or so men we become acquainted with, nearly half are dead by story's end. Some of O'Neill's favorite plot devices (alcohol, depression, revelry, good and bad luck) are present, as is his expression of foreboding.THE LONG VOYAGE HOME is also available onDVD.RELATED FILM:After Ford created a series of short documentaries for the US government, he and John Wayne did a feature about PT boats and the Pacific war, with THEY WERE EXPENDABLE (1945).

Here we have a wonderful cast of typical Ford actors: John Wayne, Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald... a script by Dudley Nichols (Stagecoach), and a unique photography by Greg Tolland (Citizen Kane). Directed all by John Ford; what else can you wish for?So what is it that keeps ""The Long Voyage Home"" from being one of Ford's greatest films? I think there's more of the spirit of Ford here than of O'Neil: The tabern brawls, the excess of drinking, the fist fights, the omnipresent Irishness... his seal is stamped all over the film, which -to me- takes away from the original plays. O'Neil liked this take on his plays? Sure, it's John Ford directing. But it's one more case of a great literary work that doesn't translate -as one would wish- to the big screen.And what about the rough sea scenes?

For 1940 Hollywood, this is an unusually realistic film, the antithesis of the standard shallow entertainment churned out by the studios.  With a rich array of character actors and John Wayne merely one of the ensemble as a Swedish seaman, accent and all, the film is harrowing and ultimately moving and sad. The story links together a series of incidents which first appeared  as one act plays from the pen of Eugene O'Neill.

It's all about the mood.  Unfortunately, the mood is melancholy at best; brooding and dense.  You feel the weight of it throughout.  That's part of the problem, if you're looking for something cheerful or upbeat, this definitely isn't it.  And.  Despite the prominent picture of John Wayne on the DVD cover, this isn't his film; he's but a bit player with little to do but grin and mishandle a Swedish accent.  It's an oddity not to be missed, but not reason enough to watch this movie.  The rest of the cast carries this piece forward: the always dependable Barry Fitzgerald, Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, and the hammy (but in a good way) Thomas Mitchell.

It is based on several one act Eugene O'Neill plays, and Mr. O'Neill absolutely adored this film.  He loved the way Ford and Dudley Nichols transcribed his plays into something beautifully cinematic.  The cinematography is some of the best of Ford's career, courtesy of Gregg Toland, the genius cameraman behind the camera for Citizen Kane.  The performances are quite special here, with special mention going to Thomas Mitchell, John Qualen, Arthur Shields, and the actor who plays Smitty (his name escapes me).  John Wayne plays a Swede here with an accent no less, but he does it superlatively, and he shows a lot of depth and sweetness in this role.  When Wayne was with Ford, he was his best, playing characters that weren't perfect and all too human.  The sailors all feel like real people and not caricatures.  There is a fight at the end of the film, and it's actually pretty brutal for its time.  I liked it because it feels real, not choreographed.  This is one of Ford's finest works, one that can seen many, many times.  Ford made so many great films that many fall between the cracks, and this is one of them.  It's really quite special.

980996,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B000F0UUIC,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[3, 5]","This little known work by director John Ford and starring John Wayne is interesting because it is an unusual role for Wayne. The style is very much that of John Ford.Wayne plays a Swedish sailor working on an English merchant ship in the opening days of World War II. The ship is in the Caribbean and gets a cargo of ammunition that is much needed in England. The problem is that ammo is a dangerous cargo that makes the unarmed freighter a very desirable target. The sailors are not thrilled about carrying such a cargo but agree to do so for the promised bonus.The crew is nervous for the entire trip. The ship is in bad shape and Atlantic storms make it worse. Keeping a lookout for U-Boats keeps everyone's tensions on edge and a suspiciously acting member of the crew makes people think in terms of betrayal and secret agents.In the midst of all of this is Ollie, the crewman played by John Wayne. He is a young man and rather ""innocent"" in the ways of the world. The entire crew is trying to encourage him to leave the sea and return home to Sweden to take care of his mama. When they finally get to England, he learns that there are perils ashore also.It's not much of an acting role. Most of the time, he just floats along with the others taking little part in the story except as a sideline. He is there but it is not about him.It's not a great film.

981001,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B000F0UUIC,T O'Brien,"[11, 11]","The Long Voyage Home is yet another film featuring John Wayne and director John Ford, and though it may be very different from the other movies the duo made, it is as good, if not better, than some of their other collaborations.  In the early years of WWII, the SS Glencairn, a freighter in the Atlantic, receives a shipment of ammunition to transport to England from the West Indies.  The ship must then sail through the dangerous waters of the Atlantic, hoping to not run into German subs.  This simple plot is very much secondary to the real storyline, the lives of the crew of the Glencairn.  Over the course of the film, the viewer comes to know all of the crew pretty well through four separate stories from writer Eugene O'Neil; a party with local girls on the boat before setting sail, the accidental death of a crewman during a storm, a possible German spy posing as one of the crew, and the efforts of the crew to get one of their own on a boat home after the Glencairn docks.  Don't go into this movie expecting action, it is a character driven movie with many great scenes of dialogue that lets the cast do their thing.  It might not be your typical John Ford and John Wayne teaming, but The Long Voyage Home is a worthy addition to any fans of the director/star combo.While John Wayne gets top billing, he really has a somewhat smaller supporting part.  Wayne plays Ole Olsen, a Swedish sailor trying to save money to get back home to Stockholm.  The Duke pulls off a good Swedish accent, and does an excellent turn overall in his supporting part.  The star of the movie is Thomas Mitchell as Aloysius Driscoll, ""Drisk"" to the crew, a veteran Irish crewman who stands as the crew's leader through the movie.  Ian Hunter is also very good as Smitty, an educated man who comes under the suspicion of the Glencairn's crew.  The rest of the crew is a who's who of John Ford stock company actors including Barry Fitzgerald as Cocky, John Qualen as Axel Swanson, Ward Bond as Yank, Arthur Shields as Donkeyman, Joe Sawyer as Davis, and Jack Pennick as Johnny Bergman.  The ensemble cast works perfectly together and holds the movie together through the four episodic storylines.The DVD only offers one special feature, a featurette called ""Serenity at Sea: John Ford and the Araner,"" which has some home movies of Ford on his personal ship.  The B & W presentation looks really strong overall for a movie made almost 70 years ago, and shows what a good job cinematographer Gregg Toland did in shooting the film.  So for a good ensemble character study that is beautifully shot and all builds to a surprising ending, check out The Long Voyage Home!

Traditionalist Wayne (and Ford) fans might be disappointed--his is a supporting role and his character is quiet (very few lines!) and passive, and even a bit dull-witted. It's disorienting witnessing scene after scene where Wayne is merely stuck in the background looking on as the story unwinds; knowledge of what Wayne was to become--perhaps the strongest and most distinctive acting presence of his times--disrupts any reading a viewer may have of the film. One sits on the edge of ones seat expecting The Duke to jump into the movie, and he just doesn't.Otherwise it's an ensemble piece but with a terrific cast. The cinematography, as others have noted, is sensational. Rather than being part of a traditional John Ford or John Wayne DVD collection, this is a film that should have been remastered and released by a company like Criterion (like Young Mr. Lincoln). Then it would go to a more appropriate and possibly more appreciative audience.",4,"Very fine, but absolutely not a ""John Wayne film""",1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,998,"['more', ""O'Neill"", 'play', 'Ford', 'film', 'Traditionalist', 'Wayne', 'Ford', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'supporting', 'role', 'character', 'quiet', 'very', 'few', 'lines', 'passive', 'even', 'bit', 'dull-witted', 'disorienting', 'witnessing', 'scene', 'scene', 'where', 'Wayne', 'merely', 'stuck', 'background', 'looking', 'story', 'knowledge', 'what', 'Wayne', 'was', 'become', 'perhaps', 'strongest', 'most', 'distinctive', 'acting', 'presence', 'times', 'reading', 'viewer', 'may', 'have', 'film', 'One', 'edge', 'ones', 'seat', 'expecting', 'Duke', 'jump', 'movie', 'just', ""doesn't.Otherwise"", 'ensemble', 'piece', 'terrific', 'cast', 'cinematography', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'sensational', 'Rather', 'being', 'part', 'traditional', 'John', 'Ford', 'John', 'Wayne', 'DVD', 'collection', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'released', 'company', 'Criterion', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'Then', 'would', 'go', 'more', 'appropriate', 'possibly', 'more', 'appreciative', 'audience']",N/A
