731211,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00007L4MV,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 5]","It's rare that filmed versions of great theatre plays come across with a sense of feeling and emotion the reader receives from the book.  Made in 1973, this Broadway Threatre Achive features a magnificent performance of Katherine Hepburn, and in my opinion, the only really great performance.The drama focuses on a family living with their illusions and delusions.  Amanda, whose husband deserted the family, is delusional about her past life, the gentleman callers, the ones who got away, She lives in the past.  Tom, a poet, dreams for more, but works in the warehouse and sees movies all the time.  He is a dreamer.  Finally, crippled Laura, anxiety-ridden, whose fantasy of life is the small delicate glass animals and the victrola.Mother is domineering and very critical of Tom, and she has asked Tom to invite a gentleman from the warehouse for dinner, fearing Laura will be an old maid.  Amanda's hopes are high.The Gentleman CallerJim was done well, maybe a little too exuberant.  Even though Jim was everything in high school, (little mention), he became a warehouse worker, still dreaming for what he was supposed to be.The Role of Laura - looking depressedWhen we READ the dramatic play, we attach a face and personality to the character.  In this production, least impressive was Laura.  To me, from the book, Laura was alive in her own world and hardly concerned about men, but she was more whimsical and innocent.  But this actor came as depressed and emotionless, certainly not who Tennessee Williams' created.Sam Waterston ???Although he wasn't as bad as the actor portraying Laura, I just didn't see this guy as the meek and mild ""poet"", warehouse low wage earner, and a real loner going to movies all the time.  It just didn't fit.The gem of it all - Katharine HepburnThere's no doubt this was an amazing portrayal of the Southern belle Amanda.  One of the best scenes were her telephone soliciting, or when she discovers the dream is over with the gentleman caller.Don't forget to view the previews from other great theatre works. Plus, another version exists on this great play.Glass Menagerie, Thedirected by Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward stars.  I plan to see it soon.Lauret Taylor - we will never see that performanceAccording to theBroadway - The Golden Age, by the Legends Who Were Therethe legends of Broadway all raved and raved about the performance of Lauret Taylor, as Amanda, in the very early days of theatre.  Too bad we may never see that  For another grand performance in theatre see Katharine Hepburn inLong Day's Journey Into Night..... Rizzo",4,Katharine Hepburn is the one to see!!!

731212,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00007L4MV,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 4]","Tennessee Williams rightfully takes his place as one of the premier playwrights in the history of the American theater. He relentlessly turned out high quality plays (and other short literary expositions) on subjects that in an earlier day before the 1950's would have not found nearly so receptive an audience. Here Williams, studying a willfully dysfunctional family, relies on a seemingly autobiographical presentation of the life of a faded Southern Belle mother and her two captive children who are fodder to her dreams of renewed grandeur and style when things `get better'. The gist of the better is a suitable husband for her distracted daughter.  That those `things' do not get better drives the dramatic tension of the work, as it almost always does in a Williams play.Williams has a magic knack for getting to the core of human relations, unpretty as they are some times. The mirror, in many cases, may be harder to take than the reality. Here the son's desire to `help' his obviously unworldly sister at the arm twisting behest of Mother by bringing a co-worker to dinner triggers a trail of events that make Sis fall further and further in the battle with reality. Someone once said that in a Williams's production no good turn ever gets rewarded. And that is the case here. While this is not the most compelling of his plays it is well worth looking at or better, reading.",5,A FAMILY TURNS ON ITSELF,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,1386,"['Tennessee', 'Williams', 'rightfully', 'place', 'one', 'premier', 'playwrights', 'history', 'American', 'theater', 'relentlessly', 'turned', 'out', 'high', 'quality', 'plays', 'other', 'short', 'literary', 'expositions', 'subjects', 'earlier', 'day', '1950', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'found', 'nearly', 'so', 'receptive', 'audience', 'Here', 'Williams', 'studying', 'willfully', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'relies', 'seemingly', 'autobiographical', 'presentation', 'life', 'faded', 'Southern', 'Belle', 'mother', 'two', 'captive', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'fodder', 'dreams', 'renewed', 'grandeur', 'style', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'better', 'gist', 'better', 'suitable', 'husband', 'distracted', 'daughter', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'work', 'almost', 'always', 'Williams', 'play.Williams', 'magic', 'knack', 'getting', 'core', 'human', 'relations', 'unpretty', 'are', 'times', 'mirror', 'many', 'cases', 'may', 'be', 'harder', 'take', 'reality', 'Here', 'son', 'desire', 'help', 'obviously', 'unworldly', 'sister', 'arm', 'twisting', 'behest', 'Mother', 'bringing', 'co-worker', 'dinner', 'triggers', 'trail', 'events', 'make', 'Sis', 'fall', 'further', 'further', 'battle', 'reality', 'Someone', 'once', 'said', 'Williams', 'production', 'no', 'good', 'turn', 'ever', 'rewarded', 'case', 'here', 'not', 'most', 'compelling', 'plays', 'well', 'worth', 'looking', 'better', 'reading']",N/A

731217,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,B00007L4MV,F. Gentile,"[55, 56]","I just received this yesterday, and immediately settled down, with the cats fed and strict orders of silence, to watch it. What a wonderful, lost jewel. This made for t.v. film was produced the year I graduated from high school, and, the life I then lived in the apartment next to a city train trestle, that I dismally shared with my mother and my dear little sister, was probably a little too similar to Tennessee Williams beautiful play to be of much interest to me then. That this play is based upon his early years is now well known, and, though she denied it most of her life, ""Amanda"", the suffocating mother played by Katherine Hepburn, is undoubtedly Edwina Williams, Tennessee Williams mother. Though she is the focal point, this  ""memory play"" is as much about Williams beloved sister Rose, whose tragic mental illness and subsequent lobotomy froze her in time. The crippled ""Laura"" inhabits another world, as did Rose.  Williams remained devoted to his institutionalized sister, who outlived him, for his entire lifetime, and always proclaimed her his lifelong love. ""Tom"", the brother and narrator of the play, dreams of a life filled with adventure, outside of the despised warehouse where he performs his menial work, and free of the  unwanted obligations to his abandoned mother and sister. Tom was Tennessee Williams real name, and there is much of him in the fictional Tom. When this play was first produced in the 1940's, Williams career was very young. He considered himself a failure, and, the play was not initially well received. Starring as ""Amanda"" was Laurette Taylor, formerly a renowned theatre actress, now a Broadway has-been, whose downfall to drink was well known in the theatre world. Upon seeing her in the first early rehearsals of this play, the financial backer screamed to the producer...""HOW could you do this to me?"" Williams was also sure he had a failure on his hands, and the play produced modest crowds upon opening, and readied for closing. However, two local Chicago critics sang its praises, and, it subsequently received immense critical acclaim and major awards. As did Laurette Taylor, whose performance went down in theatre history, and was her ""comeback"" (she died the following year.)  Katherine Hepburn, who saw the original production, is wonderful in this role. How lucky we are that The Theatre Archive has preserved her  performance. There are close-ups and little bits of business here that make one realize just how rare and skilled an actress she was. What a joy she is to watch. She perfectly conveys ""Amanda's"" suffocating behavior, all in the name of love for her children, of course. With her at times  false joy, and, at other times, her eyes brimming with tears, she repeatedly relives the memories of her bygone youth, beaus of past, and her faded promise, to the all too familiar resignation of her claustrophobic children. You may find her incessent instructions to them on how to breath, eat, stand, etc...exasperating, but this is her controlling nature. Having been abandoned 16 years earlier by her husband, she is determined to make her children ""winners"", saving them and herself from the obvious fact that they are not.  Her grown children are wonderfully and convincingly played by Sam Waterston and Joanna Miles, and Michael Moriarty is equally moving as ""The Gentleman Caller."" A touchingly beautiful version of a classic, and a total pleasure from a gentler, simpler time.

731221,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00007L4MV,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[79, 80]","Having just watched the 1973 television production of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; I have now seen every Katharine Hepburn performance she ever did on film or television.  From &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot; to &quot;This Can't Be Love&quot; I now have everything on tape (yes, even &quot;The Iron Petticoat&quot;).  This was Hepburn's first television performance and she was working with Anthony Harvey, who directed the actress in her third Oscar winning role in &quot;The Lion in Winter.&quot;  Hepburn had seen Laurette Taylor's exquisite performance in the original stage production of &quot;The Glass Menagerie,&quot; and had long considered Tennessee William's &quot;memory&quot; play to be an American classic.  Even though she is the quintessential Connecticut Yankee, Hepburn trotted out an affect Southern accent and tackled the role.The play is essentially a gigantic flashback told by Tom Wingfield (Sam Waterston), who is now a merchant seaman in a distant port recalling the final days he spent in the family home in St. Louis with his mother, the faded Southern belle, Amanda (Hepburn), and his painfully shy sister, Laura (Joanna Miles).  Stuck in a dead end job at a shoe factory and constantly going to the movies to escape his mother, Tom wants to be a poet.  Laura, made physically ill by any attempt to go out and function in the real world, has retreated to her imagination and her titular collection of glass animals.  Amanda is constantly talking about the old days on Blue Mountain, browbeating Tom for his lack of incentive, or hustling subscriptions for &quot;The Lady's Home Companion.&quot;  When his mother badgers him into finding a &quot;gentleman caller&quot; for his sister, Tom brings home Jim O'Connor (Michael Moriarty) from work.  Even better, Jim is the boy the Laura had a crush on in high school, although she certainly never would have said anything at the time.  But in a Tennessee Williams play, no good deed goes unpunished.The centerpiece of the play becomes the scene between Laura and her gentleman caller.  The scene is remarkable in that it is certainly unconventional to give two characters so much time on stage alone like this.  Suffice it to say that on the basis of this extended scene both Morairty and Miles won a pair of Emmy awards each, for Best Supporting Actor/ess in a Drama and Supporting Actor/ess of the Year (the Emmys have had their fair share of strange awards over the years).  Hepburn was nominated for Best Lead Actress in a Drama while Miles received a nod in the Supporting Actress category.This version of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; has the virtue of sticking to the play's original conclusion, which is not what happened with the 1950 film adaptation with Gertrude Lawrence, Jane Wyman, Arthur Kennedy, and Kirk Douglas.  It seems that Hollywood always felt a strong urge to make Tennessee Williams' plays more upbeat on the silver screen.

731224,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B00007L4MV,Mary Whipple,"[15, 15]","A brilliant cast gives life to this 1973 production, lending new interpretations which overcome the dated aspects of this 1944 play.  Set in St. Louis, the action takes place entirely in the crowded tenement apartment of the Wingfield family, which has fallen upon hard times.  Amanda Wingfield (Katharine Hepburn) is a domineering but good-hearted woman with two children, her husband having long vanished.  Her daughter Laura, pathologically shy, spends most of her time polishing her collection of glass animals.  Unable to adjust to the requirements of secretarial school, Laura is totally dependent on Amanda and Tom, her brother.  Amanda is determined to find a husband for Laura so that Laura will be taken care of--and she begs Tom to bring home a friend as a ""gentleman caller.""Hepburn is wonderful as Amanda, creating an Amanda who is strong and domineering, yet remarkably dedicated to her children.  Hepburn conveys none of Amanda's vulnerability, emphasizing instead her commitment and determination to control the future.  She tries to make Laura into her own image, but Laura is so overwhelmed by life that she lacks the confidence she needs to live.Michael Moriarty, as Jim O'Connor, the gentleman caller who comes for a family dinner, is terrific in his role.  His ""gentleman caller"" is an enthusiastic young man with plans for his future, but he is also an innocent, not quite aware of what Amanda has planned and unprepared for the depth of Laura's vulnerability.  Rattling on about his life, he is insensitive to Laura's feelings, having no real appreciation for the fact that she idolized him in high school and is overwhelmed by his presence in her home.  Joanna Miles, as Laura, is almost a cipher, a young woman so helpless that she is at the mercy of life's ordinary ""tragedies,"" a woman who obeys her mother because in obeying she has some sort of focus to her life.Despite these three fine performers, the play, believe it or not, belongs to Sam Waterston.  He shows the agony of a man trapped with a domineering mother and a helpless sister, and though he longs to make them happy, heknows that this is impossible.  He shows a Tom whose desire to make a life for himself while there is still time is almost palpable, and he exudes the angst which makes the play's action ""work.""  Waterston draws all the aspects of the play together, providing the only point upon which the action and climax can pivot with any sense of realism.A ""memory play"" of a family at a crisis between the old and new ways of life, The Glass Menagerie, and this cast in particular, illustrate the conflict between independence and subservience, and between southern tradition and national post-war opportunities.  Laura, who does not even know what to wish for, represents the old ways;  Tom, the direction of the new.  A sterling cast gives sterling performances here.

Driver,"[6, 6]","I have seen several versions of this play on DVD, and I would say that this is the best of what I know to be currently available, mainly because I think Katharine Hepburn is the best Amanda Wingfield.  However, I wish Joanna Miles had portrayed a less robust Laura.  She doesn't limp; she wears stylish shoes while dashing athletically out the door to the store; she demonstrates no more than an occasional interest in the glass animals that are supposed to be her obsession; under her subdued demeanor I felt enough personal strength from her to deny the sense of despair about her future that is supposed to hang in the air at the end of the play.  Perhaps Jane Wyman's Laura should have been in this production rather than being stuck in the 1950 version, with its own lamentable ending.  Perhaps this play is too dated to be believable today and they don't make helpless females any more.  (TV has sent such types into therapy.)  Nevertheless, this is a great late-career performance for Katharine Hepburn, and that's the best reason for owning this DVD, a good companion to ""Lion in Winter"" and ""On Golden Pond.""  She was born to play this faded Southern belle who has no talent for sales except as the determined purveyor of a lost culture.  Her physical fragility plus the trademark Hepburn patrician accent and mannerisms are simply perfect and utterly priceless (whereas Joanne Woodward in the same role is too perky and liberated).

I read the script in high school with the possibility to get to play Tom but production fell through. That was almost 20 years ago and I can't believe how much of it, great quotes and all, that I remembered.Katherine Hepburn was pure magic as Amanda and I was totally enamored by her. My one and only complaint was indeed her heavy and fast tone of voice. While it was a trademark that impersonators have played upon for years, it made her a bit hard to understand in places, especially when she was arguing with Tom and rattling on.Other than that, if I ever directed this production, I'd show my actors this version!  The tone and setting of the movie is brilliant, very close to what I imagine Williams himself imagined for the stage, right down to the paper shade on the bulb above the dining table or the curtains in the doorway. Being made for TV in the 70s, it's pretty bare bones.  Even the sound quality at time leads you to believe this could be a recorded stage version. But Williams called it a ""memory"" play, so I think those stark elements are important and they really come through.I bought this DVD to watch as research for a piece I'm writing about Williams.
