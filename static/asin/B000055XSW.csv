The music is great and they might have a new fan. However, the production of this dvd is cheesy and laughably bad. The concert looks like a gospel concert with some random stuff thrown on the screen like grass and running water. Its so bad that it's awesome.

All of the bad reviews are true, but the overuse/misuse of graphic effects is in no way my biggest complaint. The main problem is that the video isn't properly syncronized to the audio.

There is a noticable delay in Audio and video that in some instances Jon Anderson is not in sync with his video. It almost feels like they attempted to mesh the two performances together because they had some better angles to use.  On the positive side though, the live version of Turn of the Century was well done.  I heard an interview with Chris Squire where he mentioned that the middle section is so difficult to perform due and the 1st nights performance fell apart.  What we hear in this version is actually the 2nd nights performance of the song and they got lucky.....very lucky.....sounds remarkable.  Another memorable highlight is The Revealing Science of God.....Strange though, in Many parts no one is giving backup vocals and they have apparantly have been added in the studio.

567319,A24GD1AWG77IDJ,B000055XSW,"E. Uthman ""Ed""","[31, 46]","The program content consists of footage shot of a March, 1996, Yes concert in the Fremont Theatre, San Luis Obispo, California. Here we see the classic lineup of Yes, fronted by vocalist Jon Anderson, guitarist Steve Howe, bassist Chris Squire, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Alan White. I say &quot;fronted,&quot; because there are also one or more vocalists, and possibly instrumentalists, offstage. This is extremely disquieting to us dedicated Yes fans, who have grown up with a band who had up until then prided itself on performing all parts live and onstage.The song list is quite impressive, including some of the great Yes numbers. Here is the complete list:Siberian KhatruClose to the EdgeI've Seen All Good PeopleTime and a WordAnd You and IThe Revealing Science of GodGoing for the OneTurn of the CenturyAmericaOnwardAwakenRoundaboutStarship TrooperWhile this sounds like a dream come true, don't get your hopes up. The best that can be said for this program is that the audio mix is adequate, much better than that in YESSONGS and YES LIVE IN PHILADELPHIA 1979, but not nearly so good as the most recent Yes concert video, HOUSE OF YES. The video production is absolutely atrocious. Most of the shots consist of long views of the band, in which the musicians line the bottom of the screen, while &quot;psychedelic&quot; montages are superimposed on the wall above them. Worse, other shots show the musicians double-exposed against the artwork. There are few shots that show any of the technique of these fine instrumentalists. You can hear some great Wakeman chops, but only rarely will they show you his fingers executing them.I found it agonizing to get through this program. I had to listen to one song at a time over a period of days. I doubt I'll ever play the disc again. I suppose hard-core Yes enthusiasts will want to own the disc, but for everyone else, I can't recommend it.

It is nothing short of Yes's best works, ever, all in one performance. I for one am not bothered too much by the added-on visuals. Although the double and even triple superimpositions can and do get overdone in spots, I think it adds a level of rewatchability. I get bored with a concert film if all it is is guys playing their instruments - although there is also plenty of instrumentation being shown, for those who like that.

567322,ARJ4W05FDPQZ9,B000055XSW,"Howie ""tomas""","[4, 5]","I'd heard all the bad ""reviews"" about this video for quite some time, so I held off plunking down the hefty Japanese import price.  I'm glad I did.First off, it must be said that the band performance if excellent, even though Rick looks more than a trifle bored, especially on ""The Revelaing Science of God.""  But that's just the audio, which you can get by buying the CD.The problems with the video - and this IS a video, not a CD - are myriad.  Where to begin?  First off, the director - where did this guy come from, fresh out of video production 101? - obviously has never done a live band before.  He locks down the wide shot and never moves the camera.  The band is framed very low, with the majority of the shot consisting of the ceiling, a piece of screen terrain he continually litters with superimpositions of the band, lots of water (don't watch this if you have to go potty), and inane shots of skiers.  Really.The problem with this is that 1. the shots of the band members don't match the wide shot - obviously taken from a different nights - so what you're hearing is not what they are playing, and this is terribly distracting, 2. the b-roll doesn't match the music - there is no conceptual justification for any of the images, 3. the edits are totally random, not once synching with the music (it looks as if the editor had the sound turned down in the editing room), and 4. it's all done so poorly that one wonders how this got past the band.  (The ""cutsy-wootsy love story"" shots behind ""Turn of the Century"" really ruin that song.)And what's with those silly, stupid title cards before each song?  This totally distroys any momentum built by the live performance.How unfortunate that something this bas has to be done in the name of Yes.

567323,A3ZVT943RJ3J2,B000055XSW,Ian Martin,"[2, 4]","In brief, I was very disappointed with this DVD and have subsequently sold it. I was keen to see some clear concert footage of the band with Rick back on keyboards. I had bought the CD sometime back and was enthralled with the music as usual.  The DVD was extremely disappointing - the worst concert DVD I have watched so far. Instead of clear, crisp footage like 'Yes at the House of Blues',(which I'd recommend) I saw artistic images and a view of the stage that seemed to be taken from about a half a kilometre away! I've happily gone back to my CD to which I apply my imagination of the band playing! Agreed, the sound of this DVD is good - but a DVD is supposed to be the synchronized combination of visuals and audio.Revisiting this review after a few years, I am pleased to say that we now have three additional excellent Yes concert DVDs to choose from. 'Yes - Symphonic Live', 'Yes - Songs from Tsongas' and I have just bought 'Yes Live at Montreux 2003'. Wow, the classic Anderson, Squire, Howe, White and Wakeman lineup filmed in High definition - brilliant footage, incredibly good value DVD - $10.97 on Amazon. A ridiculously low price for 17 tracks and most of the 'Fragile' album played live!I do find it disappointing that those of us who are bold enough to be severely critical tend to be lambasted by those who deem this to be a 4 or 5 star effort. Those reading this - do note - over 30 people rated this 2 or 1 star. We must be a large group of ignorant, Yes fan amateurs indeed.'Keys to ascension' is still possibly my favourite live Yes CD - but ironically the worst DVD.

567324,A35IF873PPAMFZ,B000055XSW,"Jeff Barnaby ""Jeff Barnaby""","[0, 0]","By a lot of standards, this is a disappointing DVD.  Granted there was a time back before the DVD revolution, when bootleg videos were highly sought-after commodities, that a concert of this quality would have been gold.  Still, considering the video standards that have spoiled us over the past few years, and also the audio quality of the Keys to Ascension CDs, this concert DVD really had some high standards to live up to.  And in a lot of ways, it fell considerably short.  Still, it does manage to produce a couple of first rate performances - some of which could be considered definitive.For me, the Keys to Ascension CDs represent the period in my Yes discovery when I became a true fan of the Classic Yes music.  To this day, more than 10 years after their original release, these live versions of most of the great YES songs represent the definitive versions of the many different available recording out there.  No disrespect intended to the original recordings, they should and do remain as the foundation to progressive/art rock, but they pushed the audio production technology well beyond its limits.  The end result was something innovative, but not entirely captured.  For all the recordings that have been remastered over the past 10+ years (many of them very well done) nothing can come close to the job YES did of making these live recordings, very well performed by arguably the most definitive lineup in the band's history.Having said this, a video concert based on the show that produced these performances really has a lot to live up to.  Credit where credit is due, the song tracks, which are plentiful, make up the total live performances on both Keys CDs and appear to be the same mixes, and are of a very nice quality.  However, the video quality is marginal at best and the production is barely adequate.  Some of this can be excused by the fact that this concert was filmed in 1996 (a special 3 night event at San Luis Obispo, California) which was before the DVD revolution, so one should not expect the video to be but so good.  Where this concert really suffers is with the production which is often amateurish at best, particularly regarding the frequent use of annoying graphics and video scenes blended into the concert footage.  Much has been written by a number of reviewers about the distracting nature of these, and they are correct.  It is also notable that the Members of YES seem to be in somewhat business-like moods while performing the music.  They are there, and playing their instruments (very well as usual) but they don't appear to be all that enthusiastic about the show.  Listening to the songs on the CD leaves the listener with the impression hat the band members are really into the songs.  Watching the performance makes it look like YES is merely showing up for work. This combined with the not overly impressive camera work also detracts from the concert's quality.Personally, the track that saves everything is ""Turn of the Century"".  This is the one song where the added video actually goes along with the music.  It feels very much like a video from the early MTV years with a blending of the band's performance and a short film based on the song.  The song itself came from the ""Going for the One"" album and is yet another yes epic that is very much worth re-discovering.  Other memorable tracks include ""Close to the Edge"", ""Siberian Katru"" and ""Starship Troopers.""  The concert also contains one of the best live recordings of ""And You And I"" in existence.  Also for YES purists, the concert pulls some of the more obscure pieces from YES history with pieces like ""Onward"" from ""Tormato"", ""Awaken"" from the afore mentioned ""Going for the One"", and ""The Revealing Science of God"" from the ever controversial Tales From Topographic Oceans.  The eternal YES standards Roundabout and All good People are also present and well executed.  So if nothing else, this three-night show managed to cover a lot of YES ground, which is probably sufficient to excuse the annoying animations and marginal production quality.If this were any other band (or had this review been written by a non-YES fan) this video would do well to net three stars.

Garaguso ""progressive sounds""","[1, 3]","The fact that I was compelled to write this DVD review only moments after watching it for the first time should speak volumes about how upset I was by the end of this video.  As a YES fan since the early 70's, I do have to say I was very pleased with the performance.  Great song selection and great playing.  But as for the video of the performance itself and the way this director chooses to produce it, forget it.  I collect own approximately 100 concert DVDs and with the exception of maybe ELP's early Pictures at an Exhibition concert video, this has to be the most irritating concert video I've ever watched.  For some reason I cannot even begin to try and comprehend, the director seems to feel that fans would rather veg out and stare at images on a screen that are completely washed out to the point of being utterly unrecognizable; or stare at the video screen while planets and stars zoom by; or stare at any of the other one hundred thousand various irritating special effects that dominate this video.  I'm watching it again right now and I still can't believe what I'm seeing.  Now it's not a total waste mind you.  There are some great moments where you can actually watch and enjoy some of the performance, but unfortunately the rest just totally frustrated the heck out of me.  Plus the continuity of the concert is interrupted at the end of every song.  A shame really.  What a great concert video this could have been. If you're a die hard YES fan buy it.  Just be careful though, because by the end of watching this you'll probably be wanting to throw something large and hard through your television set.

Excellent drumming but you get to actually see little of it because of the limited camera angles.  Chris Squire gets a lot of camera which as a bassist myself was a huge treat. Wakeman simply shines on keyboards as has always done. Anderson's voice is exactly as it was on the early 70's (how come ?!)and his renditions as inspired as back then. The man has a sacred flame burning inside his throat.A note on the filming of natural scenarios interspersed/superimposed along the gig : I not only found it beautiful and tasteful but thought it really added to the dvd experience. Plus these scenes only last a few seconds and are not as abundant as most reviews want to make you think. Obssessive anyone ?!Picture : Good, sharp 4:3 as was customary back then but it has been mastered peaking at a meagre 6 Mbps to cram all 146' and both soundstreams into one dvd9 when it is clear they could have spread this onto a double disc and mastered it at a much higher bitrate. Looks good on conventional TVs but on modern screens will look poor. There is no visible pixelation or compression artifacts of any kind though.Sound :  GREAT 5.1 mix; near perfect in the tonal and dynamics department but the guitar is panned almost all the way to the left channel and the keyboards to the right to match the visuals. I could have used a more even, centered panning but I guess you can't have the cake and eat it. The 2.0 mix is pants and kept trying to split my sub in half.On the last two songs the drums somewhat die and Anderson's voice migrates to the left channel but given the overall bliss and the fact that the material is taken from several gigs I can safely say you can sit through the whole thing without making any adjustments.ighly recommended unless you're a perfectionist freak.

I was pleased with this from start to finish. The concert opens with the excerpt from ""Firebird Suite"" just like on Yessongs and then similarly into Siberian Khatru. The song list includes Close To The Edge, Time and A Word, And You And I, The Revealing Science of God, Going For The One, Turn of The Century, America, Onward, Awaken, and or course Roundabout and Starship Trooper to end things. The bad reviews that I read hear on Amazon complain about camera angles or other nonsense.The performance here is great as always - flawless - the camera is for the most part kept on the band except for some Pink Floyd like visuals in the background. This is live but the audience apparently saves their response until the very end. This is great - if you like Yessongs and the early Yes stuff from the 70's you'll love this - just sit back and enjoy.The bad reviews of this are these people that want you to think they're into all the technical aspects of a concert because they know hte jargon, but the main thing here is a flawless performance of Yes Classics that would satisfy any real fan of music.

567329,A1LQOPUN8C1C4U,B000055XSW,"M. Detko ""detkoralph""","[11, 15]","I was disturbed by some of the comments regarding this film. Let's start at the beginning. I heard a rumour at the time that Wakeman had re-joined YES and were preparing new material along the lines of Topographic Oceans. My friend then played me a new 2-CD set he bought called Keys To Ascension (KTA). I noted that it had Wakeman, and that there were a number of live tracks and a few new studio tracks. I was stunned by the fantastic production of the live tracks, and also had heard a few snips of the new material on the net, but there were several songs missing.Meanwhile I attended an exhibition where I purchased a 2nd generation VHS copy of a laser-disc ""KTA Live"". This turned out to be the live material from the CD, presented in full. I was stunned at the performances, they were near-perfect. So perfect I suspected that the musicians had possibly over-dubbed some parts. Still, having seen Yes many times beginning with 1979's triumphant 10th anniversary (Tormato) tour, I knew they could sound so good. I can also say I've played guitar for 35 years, and studied Howe's work. I re-watched and I still cannot tell if it's live all the way through, but it does seem to be live more than not. Perhaps they just did such a great job of recording the music that it lent itself to being nicely mixed. I will say that if it's true that they mixed in shots from other concerts for variety, I have no problem with that and it makes perfect sense then why I may have thought they were over-dubbing. This would at least mean the excellent performances are intact.A little later saw the release of ""Keystudio"", which I purchased immediately, and turned out to be all of the studio cuts recorded with Wakeman but not released together, only mixed up over KTA 1 or 2. Now Keystudio is a great post-classic Yes album, their best since Going For The One. There are songs like Mind Drive, over 20 minutes, and while it's not Close To The Edge, it's definetly in the tradition of the longer classic Yes tunes, and has excellent solos by Howe and Wakeman sprinkled liberally. Do yourself a favour, if you enjoyed classic Yes but are lukewarm to their newer incarnations, pick up Keystudio.Now someone said Alan White is the premier drummer...etc. Let's remember one thing: The drummer on ALL the classic Yes albums up to Close To The Edge was Bill Bruford. He was an essential part of the early Yes sound. Alan White's first album with Yes (not counting Yessongs) was the challenging Tales From Topographic Oceans. Alan White came from playing with guys like John Lennon (Plastic Ono) and his style is good, technical, but the sound is rock, wheras Bruford was jazz and fusion, with that trademark rimshot. Also, Bruford's style was such that the producer Eddy Offord could get a really tight mix. White is a more physical player, so lots of reverb and ambience started to colour Yes's sound in later albums. I think White's greatest acheivment with Yes was Relayer, especially Sound Chaser (wicked track). They never play any Relayer now, mainly cause Patrick Moraz was a fluke in that band. You wouldn't get Wakeman trying to emulate PM keys, wheras PM playing Wakeman is acceptable...Therefore any classic Yes with Bruford we hear with White drumming will always (to my ears) fall short of the Bruford originals. Bluntly: Alan White is no Bruford. Bruford is one of the best ever. However White has been the drummer for so long he IS the YES drummer, ABWH aside.So, the DVD version of this, unless they changed it from the version I saw, is bound to be excellent, tight, with great solos by Wakeman and Howe, solos that are new, not the same as the albums (I always liked this about live Yes), and in some parts so good you cannot tell the difference from the originals. They really went to a lot of effort to represent their older material. These concerts were held to honour some classic music, and I am happy to have this because it is the only visual record I have of this band performing live. I do have the Live In Philadelphia 1979, which was recorded on the same tour I saw, but the sound quality is disappointing. I am glad I got to see the same line up last year in Toronto. They amazed me by playing Revealing Science of God, and thanked the audience for making it possible for them to still be able to perform their longer cuts. They were excellent that night, and played ""South Side Of The Sky"" which I'd never seen them perform in the 25 years since 1979.The concert: There's nothing wrong with the visuals, there was a lot of imagery in their music. The images are used sparingly and in my opinion are not too distracting. Yes, all live concerts suffer from the filmakers not knowing who is soloing. Just look at the ""Goodbye Cream"" farewell concert, most of the footage is extreme close-ups of Jack Bruce's facial boils. Hey he's the singer....who cares about that skinny guy with the guitar - Eric Claptrap, Clipboard? whatever. But it's not that bad in Keys To Ascention. Worth the cheap orice it seems to be selling for, so I guess I'll have to upgrade my VHS copy.",5,For True Yes Fans - Excellent,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,5083,"['was', 'disturbed', 'comments',

I'm always excited to see a newoffering from Yes, fondly remember their fabulous liveperformances. But they seem to have the uncanny ability to release thepoorest quality product on video.  Sound-wise, this disc does not makefull use of the Dolby Digital potential - not even close.  Thesound is thin and uneven, with poor imaging and a diminishedsoundstage.  I've seen these guys live, and the dynamic range of theiraudio presentation is always vast - none of that is evident on thisdisc.  Little use is made of the rear channels for ambient effects orwidening of the soundstage.  Video-wise, the presentation isamateurish at best.  Far too much use is made of cheap editing tricks(ghost image overlays above or around the performers) in place of goodcamera work and quality production values.  It's sad to see suchconsummate musicians and performers put out such dreck.  This DVDwon't make anyone's top 10 list - if anything, it'll be at theother end of the scale.

Why make the decision to chop up each song with a fade out, then a fade in with title?  It ruins this DVD as a ""concert"" experience and takes away any sense of fluidity.What is the deal with the cheesy strobe slow mo effects?  Any mid-level portable video camera has this effect and it is stupid and annoying.  Yet the director here felt it necessary to use it quite often, like a child with a new toy at Christmas.  It's like people who put exclamation points after every sentence!  And put more and more of them!!!!!! Like their writing is going to get more exciting through them!!!!!!!!!!And the graphics????  The people hanging off cliffs superimposed during the performance of ""Awaken"" ruined the atmosphere of the piece entirely.  Perhaps they got a director who felt nobody was excited enough with Yes music unless he found whatever imagery he could to ""spice"" it up.  The only other option I could see was that the director and/or producer was so full of himself that he had to say, ""Look at me!!!!!!!!!!!  Look what I can do!!!!!!!!!!!!""  I would much rather watch Yes, thank you.For those people who bought this as their only Yes concert DVD, please don't be discouraged.  I think Yes learned the lesson with ""Yes: Symphonic Live"".  They added a feature which allows you to either turn on or off the graphics, a wonderful idea since there just may be someone who really does enjoy the visuals.  Plus, there are no annoying video effects.My solution to this one was to take the two ""Keys to Ascension"" CDs, which include all of this material, and use mixing software to reconstruct the concert and burn it onto two CDs.

All three tracks of ""Close To The Edge"" are here, plus ""The Revealing Science of God"" (the only track that I truly favored off the ""Tales of Topographic Oceans"" album), and of course, ""Roundabout"", ""I've Seen All Good People"", and their masterpiece from ""Going For the One"", the track ""Awaken"".  Plus more.This performance has 13 songs from their better album rock days (the 1970's), and this performance is about 2 and a half hours long.  There are some disappointments though about this DVD performance.  I really wish that they didn't super-impose their camera-work so much in the film.  You'll see a close-up of one performer, plus you'll see all of them filmed about 30 feet from the stage, and maybe you'll see some outside sunset scene or swaying trees.  All this overlapping each other on the film at the same time.  It kinda creates a psychedelic imagery.  But, it's not as bad as all that psychedelic art that they had super-imposed all over Emerson, Lake, and Palmer on their DVD of ""Pictures at An Exhibition"" (that was a true overkill and was truly disappointing).  Plus on this Yes performance, you will see some rapid-pace freeze frame imagery that is an eyesore too.  Fast-paced freeze frames that make the whole scene appear choppy.There wasn't too much interaction with the audience, and there was hardly any applause.  The camera breaks away after every performance so who knows what order these songs have played.  Who knows if these recordings were all done on the same night.  It seemed like this was a small theatre designed for old aging rock group has-beens which might be the case for some artists as old as they are, but I can still image that Yes could have a larger audience and a hugely respectful concert hall audience.  Maybe this show wasn't promoted very well, and maybe that theatre could only handle about 300 people.  I'll bet the show sold out fast because that audience was not too big.Anyway, this DVD of Keys to Ascension is a pretty good keeper for any Yes fan.",4,"Some of the Gods of Progressive Rock have graced the stage, once again",1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,2251,"['1996', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'Chris', 'Squire', 'Alan', 'White', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'return', 'stage', 'Fremont', 'Theatre', 'San', 'Luis', 'Obispo', 'California.Out', 'CD', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'performing', 'live', 'favorite', 'line-up', 'tunes', 'three', 'tracks', 'Close', 'Edge', 'are', 'here', 'Revealing', 'Science', 'God', 'only', 'track', 'truly', 'favored', 'off', 'Tales', 'Topographic', 'Oceans', 'album', 'course', 'Roundabout', ""'ve"", 'Seen', 'All', 'Good', 'People', 'masterpiece', 'Going', 'One', 'track', 'Awaken', 'more.This', 'performance', '13', 'songs', 'better', 'album', 'rock', 'days', '1970', 'performance', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'are', 'disappointments', 'DVD', 'performance', 'really', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'super-impose', 'camera-work', 'so', 'much', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'close-up', 'one', 'performer', ""'ll"", 'see', 'filmed', '30', 'feet', 'stage', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'see', 'outside', 'sunset', 'scene', 'swaying', 'trees', 'overlapping', 'other', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'psychedelic', 'imagery', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'psychedelic', 'art', 'had', 'super-imposed', 'Emerson', 'Lake', 'Palmer', 'DVD', 'Pictures', 'Exhibition', 'was', 'true', 'overkill', 'was', 'truly', 'disappointing', 'Yes', 'performance', 'will', 'see', 'rapid-pace', 'freeze', 'frame', 'imagery', 'eyesore', 'too', 'Fast-paced', 'freeze', 'frames', 'make', 'whole', 'scene', 'appear', 'choppy.There', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'interaction', 'audience', 'there', 'was', 'hardly', 'applause', 'camera', 'away', 'performance', 'so', 'who', 'what', 'order', 'songs', 'have', 'played', 'Who', 'recordings', 'were', 'done', 'same', 'night', 'seemed', 'was', 'small', 'theatre', 'designed', 'old', 'aging', 'rock', 'group', 'has-beens', 'might', 'be', 'case', 'artists', 'as', 'old', 'are', 'can', 'still', 'image', 'Yes', 'could', 'have', 'larger', 'audience', 'hugely', 'respectful', 'concert', 'hall', 'audience', 'Maybe', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'promoted', 'very', 'well', 'maybe', 'theatre', 'could', 'only', 'handle', '300', 'people', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'show', 'sold', 'out', 'fast', 'audience', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'big.Anyway', 'DVD', 'Keys', 'Ascension', 'pretty', 'good', 'keeper', 'Yes', 'fan']",N/A

567337,A2HDBDFX1SJ516,B000055XSW,t'amant,"[1, 1]","If every YES release was just another common concert dvd, we would be wishing for more concert visuals and psychedelic atmosphere, as this band is known for.  Keys tries, albeit in an awkward way, to fill that void, and for me it succeeds pretty well (many of the most atmospheric songs are presented just for that purpose).A good chunk of the inserted video are close-ups of various leads (over the full-stage image, or half screen), which I find invaluable for the glimpses of key moments of these great songs.  Wakeman and Howe get most of the cameos appropriately, since they are the primary soloists (Squire is not forgotten, don't worry).  Many other cool shots and angles are shown for a standing on the stage feel - you often feel you are right there with the drums.  The flowery additions are not overwhelming ... just interspersed for trippy effect.  I'm watching on a very large front projection screen with a nice audio system, so maybe that makes all the difference (so the visual clutter can be sorted out) ... I find it to be very enjoyable!As others have said, this is a set-list to die for basically and all of the performances are spot-on for the most part, in my opinion.  I have Philly too - if you think there is ANY comparison in quality to this, I would wonder where you came up with that crazy notion, Philly is very short with very low quality production and nothing close to this song selection (it is STILL worth getting though).  Symphonic is a superior production in many ways, as is Tsongas and House of YES when comparing the more recent offerings, but the actual playing and pure YES magic here is at a very high level in my opinion.Someone else pointed out that the old YES feel is very present on these performances: ALL OF THE CLOSE TO THE EDGE ALBUM, THE REVEALING SCIENCE OF GOD (up close and personal, really fantastic), the heaviest bits of the Going for the One album, America (the long version), beautiful renditions of Time and a Word, Roundabout and Onward, AWAKEN, the ever fun and jammin' I've Seen All Good people and Starship Trooper... I ask you again, WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?I enjoy floating around with the visuals as I watch the individual performances (I am a musician and have always been totally inspired by this band).  They show close-ups of hands (YES, all of us musicians would like a multi-angle option to focus on any player at will ... that would be sweet) more often than most concert dvd's, and I have many.  By the way, Steve's performance is excellent, as usual; they all seem to be completely dialed-in.  It is astonishing how well they have preserved the YES magic!No, it's not sheer perfection by any means, but all big fans of 70's YES should be halfway to the Pearly Gates and ready to open them with these keys.  The so-called huge flaws everyone seems to be obsessing about just aren't an issue in my mind.  YES members don't need to cheat to perform their great songs, they are consummate professionals in every way.Enjoy this great slice of the YES journey (on Amazon, 5 stars simply means I LOVE IT); thank you YES for this great offering.  If they release another cleaned up or expanded version someday, all the better and I will certainly get it.
