1012193,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000HC2OCS,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","Tom Zuber has great credentials in Law but seems to prefer to dabble in the territory of cinema.  Having not seen his debut film LANSDOWN (2001) it is difficult to judge from LITTLE ATHENS (2005) if he is improving with age, but looking at LITTLE ATHENS  on its own merits it seems a bit sparse in idea and in production.Athens, Arizona is the bleak setting of this day in the lives of some fairly bored (and boring) youngsters, ne're-do-wells attempting to infuse sparkle into an otherwise glitterless place. Zuber creates four story lines, spottily interweaves them, and finally connects the dots in the last reel.  The main problem is that comedy is funny because we care about the facilitators and here there really aren't any folks in which to invest.  The cast tries hard and succeeds in giving us a taste of life in the flatlands of nothingville.  D.J. Qualls (a character type who is very good, as in 'Hustle and Flow'), Michael Pena, John Patrick Amedori, Shawn Hatosi, Tory Kittles, Eric Szmanda, Jorge Garcia, Erica Leerhsen, and Michelle Horn are particularly fine and do their best with the material they are given.Tom Zuber has a style, a sense of non-scripted spontaneity incorporating the gross with the sadsack, and given time he may make a fine little film.  This one just misses.

1012197,A25R2VZXZ5X6Y3,B000HC2OCS,larry-411,"[9, 9]","This excellently-crafted film follows the lives of a group of post-high school graduates (or dropouts), late teens and early twenty-somethings for whom college is not an option. There are 4 stories which proceed independently of each other, occasionally passing off the baton from one to the next, but eventually all coming together.Little Athens is a slice of life in a relatively lifeless environment -- a small town called Athens, but it could be any small town just about anywhere. Certainly, anyone who grew up in such a place knows it well. There isn't a whole lot to do. So you do what you can to get by. These characters' lives are about who you're dating, used to date, or would like to date, who you're cheating on and who's cheating on you, who's doing drugs and who's selling them, getting jobs and getting fired, getting into trouble and staying out of trouble, and trying to figure out who you are in a town where nobody amounts to much unless you leave. Stay and you're stuck, so you may as well make the best of it. In a town with no rock concerts, no sports arena, no dance clubs, no mall, and no multiplex, there's no drama. And when the drama doesn't exist without, you create it from within. Nature abhors a vacuum, so these young people fill the void by creating their own conflicts, because it's so much easier to be discontent than not.If it sounds sad, well, where there's pity there's sympathy. And where there's sympathy there's comfort. We know these people. And that cuts to the heart of what makes this film what it is -- this brilliant young cast does what good actors are supposed to do -- they make these characters real. You never get the feeling that this is scripted, or has been rehearsed -- and the camera similarly stays out of the way.Most of the film is shot in widescreen 35MM, as if to emphasize how small these characters are set against the bleak landscape of this town. We are watching them from a distance, just observers, taking it all in and allowing us to slowly invest ourselves in these people. The last portion of the film uses hand-held 16MM, as the four separate story lines come together towards the climax of the film. Now we are there, with them, because now that we know them we are allowed into their world.The aspects of the film which stand out the most in my mind are the performances and the music. The acting is just spot on. It's always hard to single anyone out in an ensemble cast, but John Patrick Amedori's Jimmy is arguably the most sympathetic character in a film where you tend to feel sorry for everyone. He's perfectly cast -- the story had to have one sometimes sad but hopeful puppy-dog, and he's it.The other highlight for me was the music, but that's always my weakness. After the acting and the soundtrack comes Tom Zuber's intricate story, told with the luxury of one able to write it, produce it, direct it, and edit it. He should be extremely proud of this work.",5,Finding life in a lifeless town,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,2944,"['excellently-crafted', 'film', 'lives', 'group', 'post-high', 'school', 'graduates', 'dropouts', 'late', 'teens', 'early', 'twenty-somethings', 'whom', 'college', 'not', 'option', 'are', '4', 'stories', 'proceed', 'independently', 'other', 'occasionally', 'passing', 'off', 'baton', 'one', 'next', 'eventually', 'coming', 'together.Little', 'Athens', 'slice', 'life', 'relatively', 'lifeless', 'environment', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'Athens', 'could', 'be', 'small', 'town', 'just', 'about', 'anywhere', 'Certainly', 'anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'place', 'well', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'do', 'So', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'characters', 'lives', 'are', 'who', ""'re"", 'dating', 'used', 'date', 'would', 'like', 'date', 'who', ""'re"", 'cheating', 'who', 'cheating', 'who', 'doing', 'drugs', 'who', 'selling', 'getting', 'jobs', 'getting', 'fired', 'getting', 'trouble', 'staying', 'trouble', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'town', 'where', 'nobody', 'much', 'leave', 'Stay', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'best', 'town', 'rock', 'concerts', 'sports', 'arena', 'dance', 'clubs', 'mall', 'multiplex', 'drama', 'when', 'drama', ""n't"", 'exist', 'create', 'Nature', 'vacuum', 'young', 'people', 'fill', 'void', 'creating', 'own', 'conflicts', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'be', 'discontent', 'sad', 'well', 'where', 'pity', 'sympathy', 'where', 'sympathy', 'comfort', 'know', 'people', 'heart', 'what', 'film', 'what', 'brilliant', 'young', 'cast', 'what', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'make', 'characters', 'real', 'never', 'get', 'feeling', 'scripted', 'been', 'rehearsed', 'camera', 'similarly', 'way.Most', 'film', 'shot', 'widescreen', '35MM', 'emphasize', 'how', 'small', 'characters', 'are', 'set', 'bleak', 'landscape', 'town', 'are', 'watching', 'distance', 'just', 'observers', 'taking', 'allowing', 'slowly', 'invest', 'ourselves', 'people', 'last', 'portion', 'film', 'hand-held', '16MM', 'four', 'separate', 'story', 'lines', 'come', 'together', 'climax', 'film', 'Now', 'are', 'there', 'because', 'now', 'know', 'are', 'allowed', 'world.The', 'aspects', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'most', 'mind', 'are', 'performances', 'music', 'acting', 'just', 'spot', 'always', 'hard', 'single', 'anyone', 'out', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Amedori', 'Jimmy', 'arguably', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'film', 'where', 'tend', 'feel', 'sorry', 'everyone', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'story', 'had', 'have', 'one', 'sometimes', 'sad', 'hopeful', 'puppy-dog', 'it.The', 'other', 'highlight', 'was', 'music', 'always', 'weakness', 'acting', 'soundtrack', 'Tom', 'Zuber', 'intricate', 'story', 'told', 'luxury', 'one', 'able', 'write', 'produce', 'direct', 'edit', 'should', 'be', 'extremely', 'proud', 'work']",Little Athens

We meet one young man who is being given a second chance by serving community service instead of time after being convicted of robbery.  But when we discover that he got caught because his car ran out of gas in front of the victim's house and he attempted to return the stolen property, we know things are not going to go well.

1012199,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000HC2OCS,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 0]","Little Athens is a circuitous look at post-high school life in the small town of Athens, Arizona (although, as the opening scene states: ""it could have taken place anywhere""), using a series of loosely interwoven characters to develop more of an apathetic tone rather than a typical plotline. It succeeds in communicating this sense of boredom with its audience, although it does so at the risk of actually being a bit boring at times. But, the characters and their stories are very believable and realistically portrayed, even if they go over the top a few times.The entire film eventually centers around a party that all the characters happen to attend, in which we see how their various lives are intertwined, and ultimately see how the lifestyles of the bored and lost can result in irreversible damage to multiple lives.The cinematography is often stunning, although occasionally the low budget filmmaking stands out when the digital camera can't keep up with the action, and this does detract from the film, but only enough to remind you that this movie was made on an extremely low budget, which is more reason to be impressed by the rich colors and scene arrangements.There is a behind the scens featurette on the DVD, but it's only about five minutes long and doesn't offer much insight you can't gather from watching the film itself.",3,"For a low budget film with such a big cast, Little Athens pays off",1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,1343,"['Little', 'Athens', 'circuitous', 'look', 'post-high', 'school', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'Athens', 'Arizona', 'opening', 'scene', 'states', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'anywhere', 'using', 'series', 'loosely', 'interwoven', 'characters', 'develop', 'more', 'apathetic', 'tone', 'rather', 'typical', 'plotline', 'communicating', 'sense', 'boredom', 'audience', 'so', 'risk', 'actually', 'being', 'bit', 'boring', 'times', 'characters', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'even', 'go', 'top', 'few', 'times.The', 'entire', 'film', 'eventually', 'party', 'characters', 'happen', 'attend', 'see', 'how', 'various', 'lives', 'are', 'intertwined', 'ultimately', 'see', 'how', 'lifestyles', 'bored', 'lost', 'can', 'result', 'irreversible', 'damage', 'multiple', 'lives.The', 'cinematography', 'often', 'stunning', 'occasionally', 'low', 'budget', 'filmmaking', 'out', 'when', 'digital', 'camera', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'action', 'detract', 'film', 'only', 'enough', 'remind', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'more', 'reason', 'be', 'impressed', 'rich', 'colors', 'scene', 'arrangements.There', 'scens', 'featurette', 'DVD', 'only', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'long', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'insight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'gather', 'watching', 'film']",Little Athens
