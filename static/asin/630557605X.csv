You know what's going to happen because you've seen it a million times before. Does that stop this movie from being fun and enjoyable?. The answer is a definite 'no'. Drew Barrymore plays Josie, a reporter for a newspaper who is assigned to go back to high school to do an investigative report. Of course, she's supposed to be ugly and uncool. Sure. Whatever. The usual things start to happen. She falls in love with someone and yada yada yada. The cool kids against the geeky kids. The usual drill. Barrymore plays it quite well. I can't think of anyone else having done this but her. David Arquette, as her brother, brings loopy fun to the proceedings. But, the romance between Barrymore and her teacher, played by Michael Vartan, has no fire. No spark. It was a wasted opportunity. SNL'S Molly Shannon is one hand for some great comedic relief.

But it also is the type of movie if one is honest will remind you of how far you have come since you were in high school. And how high school probably made you stronger in some way, like Marine boot camp makes a man or woman stronger.I was so happy to see the movie stayed on course and that unlike some movies didn't play fast and loose with the facts of life.  The character played by Drew Barrymore, does become someone the high school joke wants.  But whoever wrote the script played it right and never allowed her to kiss the guy, because she was playing a woman over the age of 21, and the guy was a high school student and thus under the age of 18.  This simply shows that whoever wrote the script did so, knowing what the laws are and that no reputable reporter would allow themselves to get so caught up in their undercover story that they would intentionally break the law.Also loved the movie because it showed how no matter who you are in high school, be it the jock, the nerd, the cheerleader, the mall rat, popular or not so popular, one has challenges, and that there is no perfect ride.  In fact at the end when Drew Barrymore's character sees the three popular snotty girls about to do something mean to the nerd girl whom the jock and now homecoming king is dancing with, she jumps in and saves the day, and then lets loose and outs herself as an undercover reporter, and proceeds to remind all those at the prom, that who they are now, is not who they will be in a few years. That high school is like a cocoon that in many ways protects one from the real world.  That life holds different things for us as we walk down life's path.So its a movie anyone from high school age to eighty can actually learn from. Even if it is to remind us of what we went thru, where we are now and that how we treat the least amongst us is really important.

470087,A2PBV1899CX3TE,630557605X,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 4]","I love Drew Barrymore, but there is a reason that she has Never Been Kissed, and it is because of her horrible acting. The Executive Producer should have fired her on the spot, but wait a minute. She WAS the executive producer. That explains a lot. This is the first film in Drew's producer resume, and her acting is OK in parts, but she only partially redeems herself, because when she is bad, she is very bad.She is playing a copy editor at Chicago Sun Times who has been given a chance to be a reporter. Her assignment: go back to High School posing as a student and dig up a scandal. Her return to High School triggers all kinds of painful flash backs, because she was a major geek. They all called her Josie Grossie. As an uptight copy editor, always correcting everyone's grammar, she is OK. When she goes back to High School, she is really bad. The script was not her BFF, either:---------------Guy Perkins: Hi, I'm Guy.Josie Geller: Yes, you are a guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Hey, that rhymes! Yikes. Bikes!Guy Perkins: Are you in special-ed? I mean, are you?Kristin Davis: A Geek?Gibby Zerefski: You totally just said that out load.==========================================David Arquette plays her brother. He was popular in High School, where he was a talented baseball player, but since he never made it to the Big Leagues, his High School years were the highlight of his life, and it was downhill fast from there. He goes back for another shot, and also to help her infiltrate the cool kids. Once Josie gets to drop the geek act, then she does much better. But still, that is not enough to save this movie from the terrible story. It just doesn't work, and it doesn't allow her to really get back at the guy who asked her to the prom only to drive by in the limo and egg her. That, or something similar, would have made the catharsis complete.You'd think that after so many movies have been done in this whole High School genre, what works and what don't work would be obvious. Yet, the writers decided unwisely to reinvent the wheel, and that is why this vehicle never goes anywhere. They didn't plan to fail, they just failed to plan.On the bright side, Molly Shannon as Anita, and John C. Reilly as Gus, were both funny, as usual. Shannon especially. Sean Whalen shows the makings of a good character actor, as Merkin, Josie's assistant. Leelee Sobieski as Aldys, a girl from the outcast math club, The Denominators, who befriends Josie early on, is someone to watch for. A couple of small parts were played by actors who went on to bigger and better things, so don't miss James Franco and Jessica Alba.At the prom there are slow dances to ""Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want"" (Written by Johnny Marr and Steven Patrick Morrissey and performed by The Smiths) and ""Don't Worry Baby"" (Written by Brian Wilson and Roger Christian and performed by The Beach Boys). ""Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want"" was also in the prom scene in Pretty in Pink.Bottom line, Never Been Kissed is a weak addition to the High School movie genre, but nevertheless you still might enjoy it if you like Drew Barrymore enough to put up with her less than stellar performance.10 Movies That Are WAY Better Than Never Been Kissed (1999)Heathers - 20th High School Reunion Edition(1988)Mean Girls (Special Collector's Edition)(2004)Pretty in Pink(1986)The Breakfast Club(1985)Sixteen Candles(1984)10 Things I Hate About You(1999)Romy and Michele's High School Reunion(1997)Grosse Pointe Blank(1997)Down to You(2000)She's All That(1999)-----------Josie Geller: Somebody once said, ""To write well, you have to write what you know.""

470098,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,630557605X,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 6]","While the plot is not airtight, Never Been Kissed succeeds because it does not try to be anything other than what it is--a quirky, fun romantic comedy.  I adore Drew Barrymore, and she is wonderful in this movie, allowing us to see her as a pitiful, geeky teenager, a plain and mousy young lady, and ultimately as a beautiful, self-confident woman.  Josie Geller (Barrymore) is a copy editor at a Chicago newspaper who desperately wants to be a reporter.  The eccentric head of the newspaper selects her to go back to high school undercover and produce a story about today's teenaged youths.  Excitement turns to horror as Josie flashes back to her torturous high school days as ""Josie Grossie,"" but she puts all of her effort into fitting in with her new classmates. She eventually ""transitions"" from geek-dom to join the cool group and develops a real connection with her English teacher Mr. Coulson (Michael Vartan from TV's ""Alias"").  Predictably, things go screwy on prom night, but Josie manages to deliver a story that has all of Chicago talking.The flashbacks to Josie's teenaged years, especially the prom night fiasco, are incredibly touching and painful to watch.  The chance to go back to high school and be one of the cool, popular people is almost every geek's ultimate fantasy; as this movie shows, though, such acceptance by your teenaged peers does not guarantee happiness--what matters most is being true to yourself and to your real friends.  The love story component of the movie ends up seeming a little rushed and could have used a little more foundational structure, but its culmination is a beautiful, heartwarming thing.  Along the way, there are plenty of laughs, as Josie's attempts to fit in at high school are both pitiful and hilarious.Look for a definitely pre-Dark Angelish Jessica Alba as one of the cool girls and SNL's Molly Shannon as Josie's friend Anita.  David Arquette is quite good (much less annoying than usual) but does not seem to merit the sharing of the main credits.  To be honest, this rather formulaic movie with its stereotypical depiction of high school society could have been a forgettable, disappointing experience had it starred someone without Drew's immense acting ability and natural charm.  For that reason I am giving it only four stars, but I must say I myself never tire of watching this funny, heartwarming movie.",4,"A funny, uplifting romantic comedy",1026345600,"07 11, 2002",2002,2377,"['plot', 'not', 'airtight', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'quirky', 'fun', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'adore', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'allowing', 'see', 'pitiful', 'geeky', 'teenager', 'plain', 'mousy', 'young', 'lady', 'ultimately', 'beautiful', 'self-confident', 'woman', 'Josie', 'Geller', 'Barrymore', 'copy', 'editor', 'Chicago', 'newspaper', 'who', 'desperately', 'be', 'reporter', 'eccentric', 'head', 'newspaper', 'go', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'undercover', 'produce', 'story', 'today', 'teenaged', 'youths', 'Excitement', 'horror', 'Josie', 'back', 'torturous', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'Josie', 'Grossie', 'effort', 'fitting', 'new', 'classmates', 'eventually', 'transitions', 'geek-dom', 'join', 'cool', 'group', 'real', 'connection', 'English', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Coulson', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'TV', 'Alias', 'Predictably', 'things', 'go', 'screwy', 'prom', 'night', 'Josie', 'deliver', 'story', 'Chicago', 'talking.The', 'flashbacks', 'Josie', 'teenaged', 'years', 'especially', 'prom', 'night', 'fiasco', 'are', 'incredibly', 'touching', 'painful', 'watch', 'chance', 'go', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'be', 'one', 'cool', 'popular', 'people', 'almost', 'geek', 'ultimate', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'though', 'such', 'acceptance', 'teenaged', 'peers', 'not', 'guarantee', 'happiness', 'what', 'most', 'being', 'true', 'real', 'friends', 'love', 'story', 'component', 'movie', 'up', 'seeming', 'little', 'rushed', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'foundational', 'structure', 'culmination', 'beautiful', 'heartwarming', 'thing', 'way', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'Josie', 'attempts', 'fit', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'pitiful', 'hilarious.Look', 'definitely', 'pre-Dark', 'Angelish', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'one', 'cool', 'girls', 'SNL', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'Josie', 'friend', 'Anita', 'David', 'Arquette', 'quite', 'good', 'much', 'less', 'annoying', 'usual', 'not', 'seem', 'merit', 'sharing', 'main', 'credits', 'be', 'honest', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'movie', 'stereotypical', 'depiction', 'high', 'school', 'society', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'forgettable', 'disappointing', 'experience', 'had', 'starred', 'someone', 'Drew', 'immense', 'acting', 'ability', 'natural', 'charm', 'reason', 'am', 'giving', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'must', 'say', 'never', 'tire', 'watching', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'movie']",Never Been Kissed VHS

The clinging gowns, the ratty hair, the make-up emphasizing her worst features (a nose looking a little on the Miss Piggy side, shot from slightly below) and down-playing her best, her pretty eyes, her sensual mouth.  Instead of looking pleasingly plump, Drew comes off as plainly fat.  But this is all the better for the metamorphosis to come.I didn't stick around for that, secure in the knowledge that it was inevitable (but you might want to see for yourself).  Incidentally, Drew was the executive producer, which shows she has guts as well as some loose change for such ventures.Second question: does Drew sell out her chess and math club friends to join the cheerleaders?  And if so, how does Director Raja Gosnell pull that off without making the darling of E.T. (1982) look like a shallow social-climber?I'm not sure that was pulled off as well as it might have been, again not sticking around for the finale, but you might want to check it out.  Also worth checking out (if you're a girl) is Michael Vartan who does a fine job playing Drew's sympathetic teacher.Bottom line: Connoisseurs of Drew will find much worth while here, as will 15-year-old home alones on a Saturday night plotting their eventual triumph, but experienced movie-goers will probably want to watch reruns of Seinfeld or Just Shoot Me.  Or better yet, if you're looking for a girl-nerd flick that really is funny and painfully sad and true-to-life in a totally original way, I highly recommend Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995) which really is brilliant.",3,Sure.

470107,A1T3Z4LIM2Y7U1,630557605X,Elana,"[45, 47]","First and foremost, I would like to say that I heartily disagree with Mr. Dave McCoy's editorial review. Mr. McCoy stressed that there was a &quot;complete inability to buy Barrymore as unattractive, awkward, and  unpopular.&quot; This could not be further from the truth. In &quot;Never  Been Kissed,&quot; Drew Barrymore stars as Josie Gellar, a news reporter  for the Chicago Sun Times. As the film opens, Josie receives her first  undercover assignment: she must enroll in a local high school, where she  will collect information about teenagers today. Josie, though excited by  the challenge, is worried: her own high school years were spent as an  unattractive geek, being endlessly ridiculed and humiliated by her peers.  Despite what Dave McCoy said, Barrymore plays a very convincing role and is  completely believeable as a geek. David Arquette, who plays Josie's lively  brother Rob, also puts in a great performance. And Michael Vartan, who  plays Josie's English teacher and the object of her affections, does a  great job as well. This movie has an excellent ending, and it teaches you  that your status in high school does not affect your career or your plans  for the future. &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; is the first movie I have  seen in a long time that is both hilarious and meaningful at the same time,  making it a definite &quot;must-see&quot; for everyone.

At a staff meeting one day, she is given the chance of a lifetime.  She gets to be an undercover reporter and she'll be going back to high school.  She is incredibly excited until she realizes that none of her co-workers think she can really do it and her brother points out that she was a loser in her high school days.Unable to cast aside her past experiences and doubts, Josie is unable to overcome her insecurities until her brother Rob (David Arquette) convinces her that all she needs is to believe in herself, and have someone else believe in her.  With his help, she begins to find her wilder and more free-spirited side, both in and out of school.  This attracts the attention of the popular kids and the eyes of her English teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan), who she begins to fall in love with.Unfortunately, as her romantic feelings begin to blossom for Sam, her boss decides that her romantic interests in Sam (and his reciprocating feelings) must be the story.  This causes Josie to almost ruin any chance she might have with Sam just so she can save her job.In the end, she writes an incredibly popular story about her self-discovery.  She also apologizes to everyone who she hurt along the way, including Sam, who she doesn't specifically name.  She informs him of her feelings and asks him to please meet her on the pitcher's mound on the night of the state baseball championship for her first 'real' kiss.NBK is a happy love story with some very sad flashbacks that help the viewer to understand the pain that Josie once endured and is now overcoming.

470141,A11ID14NBRS9UB,630557605X,"""marshmelly""","[3, 4]","I am a huge Drew Barrymore fan and I have been following her work forever I've probably seen every movie she's done and so far I like all the work she's done she's a very beautiful strong woman and talented honest actress.The main star Drew Barrymore (Charlie's angels 1 &amp; 2, the wedding singer, etc., etc.) plays Josie Geller, a 25-year-old who graduated school at the top of her class. She's never kissed a guy or even had a real boyfriend but she is the youngest copy editor at the Chicago Sun Times and wants to be a serious reporter. So she was very excited when she is assigned her very first job as a reporter to go back to high school as a regular teenager and find out about teenagers today. Then she remembers her own painful high school experience and it seems impossible that she will be able to fit in and get her story.When she first starts going back to high school it looks like Josie's second experience of high school will be another nightmare until her brother enrolls himself in school also undercover as Josie's ex-boyfriend and quote 'good friend' unquote. He fits right in with the cool kids and makes his sister seem wild and cool to everyone. That's when things really get interesting at school and suddenly Josie is a huge part of the group of cruel but ridiculously attractive and popular teens but soon realizes for the first time in her life that maybe this isn't a group she wants to be a part of after all.David Arquette (from the scream movies) plays Josie's 23-year-old brother Rob a popular fun-loving easygoing guy but is not as success-driven (he still lives with his parents, never went to college, works at what is called the &quot;tiki post&quot;) as his sister. In my opinion David brings a fun and carefree vibe to every scene he's in. Let me just say I found what Rob says in the movie as advice to Josie &quot;all you need is the right person to think your cool and your in everyone else will be too scared to question&quot; very true in my experience because just like everyone else, even popular people fear rejection. Although I admit some things in the movie are just a cliche and not really how high school is.There is so many characters that are great cause the whole cast is great but this would be too long to tell about them all you'll just have to check the movie out to see and appreciate them all.Constantly Teased by the cool kids, pressured by her boss and a deadline for a great story, Smitten and distracted by her English teacher, and haunted by her past, it's an interesting and often hilarious and touching to watch Josie's journey to realizing if she wants others to accept her, she'll have to accept herself first and not being ashamed of who you really are is cool in itself.Despite what the editoral review said, although drew is beautiful and popular in real life she has the ability to sink in to every character and cliche she is given in her movies, She's almost played about every cliche and I know a girl in my old school that I went to school with Elementry, Junior High, and High School and in each one the whole school knew her because she was totally clumsy akward annoying and geeky and was harrassed by almost the entire school and as far as I know had no friends and certianly had no boyfriends. Drew plays that part so well it's not even funny. And like someone else said the movie teaches you that no matter what symbol status you had in school you still can have a bright and happy future if you believe in what you can do and choose to not let your past and mistakes control you. The girl in my school I mentioned attends a great college and is engaged. So my advice is to those that attend school don't under-estimate the &quot;akward geeks&quot; in your school cause one day they could grow out of it and have a great future and maybe even become famous one day. So you may want to be nice cause some day you might be kicking yourself in the head for treating them like crap.Bottom line, this movie is funny, romantic, touching, and supported and saved by a terrific conviencing and talented cast.

470142,A152C8GYY25HAH,630557605X,Matthew Horner,"[5, 10]","Josie Geller [Drew Barrymore] is the youngest copywriter with her own office at The Chicago Sun-Times. Gawky, clumsy and dressed in clothes that look like they came from the Salvation Army store, she is one of Hollywood's favorite characters - the goofy but lovable nerd. She wants to be an investigative reporter, but her colleagues tell her it takes guts and courage to be one. One day, the newspaper's tyrannical editor announces he wants an expose of high school life, and he gives clueless Josie the job. The first of her dreams has come true.So far, so good. Never Been Kissed starts off like it is headed towards being a nifty satirical comedy. It is, until Josie walks through the doors of the high school. Then it comes dangerously close to becoming just another stock teenage comedy. The students and teachers she meets are all interchangeable with characters you see in almost every other isn't-high school-a-drag-but-don't-you-just-love-it-anyway movie. There are the two dream boats - one a student, the other a teacher. We have the blonde girls of the drop dead [gorgeous] club, the jocks without brains, and the nerds without a clue. And, of course, the apex of life before twenty - The Prom. [I should admit here that I went to an all boys' school, so there was no prom. Instead, we had a party that lasted from junior year until well into college. Worked for me!]I am fond of Drew Barrymore, who co-produced this movie. Some critics have said her talents are worthy of her illustrious theatrical family. They may be right, but it's time for Drew to get past the ingenue roles. Besides, this is the second time in three years she has played a Cinderella. She did the far superior Everafter in 1997. It is too predictable to her going from an ugly duckling to a swan, as she does in Never Been Kissed, since she is one of the more beautiful women in movies today. She is hysterically funny before her makeover is complete. She is blithely unaware that she has bad hair, bad clothes and bad timing. She trips over things, and she walks into doors. Had she been in a movie where she stayed this way, I am sure the reviews would have been glowing, because she played against type. But this is a fairy tale, so she must be transformed. In the process, the whole premise of the journalistic expose falls by the wayside.There are enough bits and pieces of old songs played in this movie to fill at least two CDs. This trend is becoming tiresome, because it is so blatantly commercial. The movie studio and the recording company are usually owned by the same conglomerate these days. They call it synergy, and, indeed, in some cases, the soundtrack makes more money than the movie. Still, the process is rarely a creative one, and I lately have begun to cringe when the newest credit line - Music Supervisors - comes on. What exactly is it that these supervisors get paid for? To get the most Oldies but Goodies for the least amount of money? Is it a full time profession? Will an Oscar be created for it?Never Been Kissed had the talent behind it to stand well above the others, but this same talent chickened out and opted for the old tried and true.

470143,A3TYO5D7YVSIIE,630557605X,Matthew J. Virchow,"[5, 6]","First of all, a film that seems to relate in a way to this movie is Superstar.  Although, this film isn't dumbed up on purpose to show off Saturday Night Live's actors and actresses (even if this film stars Molly Shannon as well).  This is somewhat of an original piece of comic relief and fun that stirs a mix of romance, determination of popularity, cruelness to others, getting a second chance to make something of yourself, and sexual related laughs- including the hilarity given from David Arquette (Rob).In this film, 25-year old Josie (Drew Barrymore), must go back to high school as an undercover reporter to get a hot sleezy story.  Knowing of her past experience in Sr. High, as the school's biggest geek, she tries to fit in by changing her look.  Right off the bat, she isn't a big hit (dressing in a chicken suit-looking outfit and spilling milk all over herself), and joins the math club- finding a &quot;nerd&quot; friend who welcomes her in (played by Leelee Sobieski).  But after her brother comes back to high school in search of getting a career in baseball, and receiving instant likeness and popularity, he spreads the rumor that Josie rocks, and she is in.  She goes from a loser to the Prom Queen.  With Guy, that one &quot;guy&quot; who makes high school worth going to for her, &quot;crunching&quot; on her, Josie's dreams come true, until the beans are all spilled at the prom and Josie falls in love with her English teacher.I think that this is probably one of Drew's best performances, simply because it is the perfect film for teens and couples.  She is a character some will relate to, and the basicness of the whole film is easy to follow.  It doesn't take really disgusting jokes way to the limit, or fill up with sex, drug-use, and suicide- like many sick comedies do.  I must admit, I died laughing when Josie's dream date through an egg at her forehead driving by in the limo!  While cruel, it's hilarious.  There are many toned-down elements that make this film work.  It doesn't go over the top like ROAD TRIP, AMERICAN PIE, HALF BAKED or THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  The performances work, and the ending especially... which literally keeps you on the edge of your seat- regardless of whether or not you can predict it.  Molly Shannon's appearance is a delight (for once!), stepping off of roles like A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY.For anyone who's dreamed of being the one everyone wants to be like, the popular one...  the prom queen (or king), this is the film for you.  (Or if you are just looking for a fun comedy or good date movie.)Simplicity meets Comedy meets Romance meets Dreams. Raja Gonsell's film is a triumph for mostly the whole family.

A 28 or so year old Josie works as a copy editor but dreams of being a journalist and having her own story. She is plain, with mousey hair, pimpled skin, and simple, plain clothes. For the most part, people tend to overlook her, if they pay her any attention at all. So becoming a journalist in the competitive field is unlikely, unless she does something extraordinary to prove she's able to handle the job.Because she looks so young, and due to other circumstances, she is finally assigned a journalist job: Go back to high school and infiltrate on the inside to get her story.Josie realizes she can reinvent herself now, to be anyone and act any way she wants, because she's not a high school student anymore. She starts off a bid nerdy, but soon comes into her own, when one of the more popular 'boys' in school takes an interest in her. Her all-star baseball playing brother gets into the act when he comes to the school under pretense to help her out as well.In the process of writing and researching her column for the undercover investigation, she wears a wire and is monitored by those with whom she works. When one of the younger, more attractive and popular teachers acts in what can be misconstrued as an inappropriate way with Josie--who is supposed to be a child--the boss tells Josie that they have to expose the teacher.Josie has now betrayed everyone's trust and the truth, as it has a way of doing, finally comes out to everyone... in the end, Josie apologizes to the teacher, but he still feels betrayed, so she writes to him in the paper and sets up an extraordinary meeting with him in the public eye, revealing she has never had a real, grown up kiss... and that she wants him to be her first. Will he show up? That's the ultimate ending to the show, but you'll have to watch it to find out.There are a few laugh out loud moments in the show, if you're one who has ever had an insecure moment back in high school. There are some smile moments too, and the ending works for the story. It's a good movie for a fun and cute entertainment experience and I'd say it's mostly okay for kids to watch too.

Watching her in the movie playing a girl who was always trying to desperately to fit in, in high school but never could and always was the butt of someone's joke. All grown up Josie is now successful and working as a reporter, she is given an assignment by her boss wonderfully played by Gary Marshall to do a story undercover, the catch: she is going back to high school. Hoping to redeem herself, Josie tries to be cool and fit in with everyone, but instead looks like a fool.She soon meets a nice guy, who happens to be her english teacher and soon their friendship turns into more than a friendship. The rest of the story is pretty much Hollywood formula romance, but it is still an enjoyable film. There are also some amazing supporting performances by John C. Reilly and Molly Shannon as Josie's coworkers Gus and Anita, David Arquette as Josie's brother Rob, Jessica Alba and Michael Vartan as Josie's teacher and love interest. Never Been Kissed is a great movie, and is something I can relate to, growing up in elementary and junior high I was never the popular one, but then I realized now that it doesn't matter if you're popular or what people think about you. As long as you have confidence in yourself, it doesn't matter what other people think. This movie does not only have good laughs, but a great message as well.

Having been an outcast and tormented endlessly in school when she was young, she now gets a second chance to finally fit in, and if possible, live her dream of becoming popular, find the right guy, and get a good story all at the same time.I thought this movie was great. I mean, most people in high school never really fit in, and watching this movie is like relating to a fantasy that would never become true for most of us. Anyway, Drew Barrymore acted superb as Josie and the chemistry between her and Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan) was well done. The rest of the cast like Molly Shannon, David Arquette and John Reilly provided good humor for this movie.Now coming to the review of this DVD: Ok, since this is kind of an old movie, and the DVD was probably released when the concept of DVDs first came out, but that doesn't mean that they should include ONLY a theatrical trailer in it. Forget special features, there isn't even a cast and crew information section in this DVD. At least they could have added that. THAT is why I removed a star and gave this a 4-star rating.Anyway, whether this DVD is packed with features or not, this is a fun movie to watch if you just want to see a light hearted romantic comedy.

Her films' ""Firerstarter"" and ""Cat's Eye"" remain some of my favorites although I loved most all films that came out in the early to mid eighties.Drew was a bit too young to be part of the ""brat pack"" actors and actresses of the eighties (Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Andrew McCarthy, Molly Ringwald, Mathew Broderick, etc.)  although Drew started in ""Altered States"" and ""E.T.: The Extra-terrestrial""  before any of those ""brat pack"" stars were ever filmed or even recognized.But, what really makes this film stand out for me is the absolutely wonderful young actress Leelee Sobieski.  Her role here as an aggressively self-defending unpopular nerd girl was such a great role for her.  I really loved how she played her character here.  In many cases, she really upstaged Drew Barrymore as a performance demanding attention.  Even Jessica Alba (who had a mean role here) couldn't steal anyone's fire in this film.I thought this film was fun.

Luckily, &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; is one of the good ones. What makes this teen comedy stand out from all of the rest is that it has genuine acting talent, Drew Barrymore included; a plot with meaning; and this film is often very touching.Josie Geller has graduated high school and holds a job for a prestigious Chicago newspaper. She needs to submit a story or her job and her boss's job are on the line. She is given the task of going undercover into a high school to get the scoop and what's going on in today's schools and to come up with a story. So, she's back in high school and she is picked on just like when she was originally in high school. This is the start to one of the most touching teen comedies that has ever been produced.There are many things that make this movie one to remember. The acting is great and you don't have just anybody thrown into this film. You get great acting talent with people like Drew Barrymore and David Arquette among others that hold skill in acting. This movie also has a plot that is cliched but gives more backbone to the cliches and the movie just seems very original. When there are flasbacks of Josie's days back in high school you feel for her character and you'll ask yourself, &quot;How can people be so cruel to one another?&quot; All of these things make for a great teen comedy that won't be forgotten.

This movie is a feel good movie !In this movie, Drew Barrymore plays Josie, a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times. When she finally gets her break and gets to go undercover, she ends up in high school as a 17 year old girl.She tells this to her brother, and he let her remember how things were for her in high school, which was all forgotten. &quot;Do you remember what they called you in high school&quot; says Rob (David Arquette who plays her brother). &quot;Josie Grossie&quot; Josie replies. She all remembers and tells to herself in the mirror that it is a very bad idea.Her first day is a complete disaster: Anita (Molly Shannen plays her colleague) has picked out the worst outfit you could imagine. The second disaster is that she comes late in class and has to wear the sombrero (a Spanish hat). And the third disaster is that she says that she comes from Billy- Bali (suburb of Bali) and tells that her parents are sheep farmers. And all these disasters are happened in like 15 minutes.After a while when she almost has given up hope, her brother Rob comes and help her out as the popular kid. He helps her to be popular, so that she can get her story.Her boss (Garry Marshall) is filming everything she's doing, since Josie can't find her story.

Josie Gellar (Drew Barrymore), a 25-year-old copy editor/reporter, has never quite gotten over her traumatic high school years, replete with bad hair days and insensitive classmates.  Understandably, she has mixed emotions when her boss, noticing how young she looks, decides Josie can go undercover and give ""Sun"" readers the latest scoop on high school life.  So back to Fast Times at Ridgemont High...  Not only is Josie anxious about this assignment, but she's worried about her personal life.  At 25, Josie has never even kissed a guy (or rather, been kissed by a guy)--but she doesn't just want to kiss any guy, but someone really special.While researching this high school expose, Josie has painful flashbacks as she witnesses how kids treat each other. (That a woman as pretty as Drew Barrymore would be willing to look as bad as she possibly can is sheer dedication to her art!) Through her brother's influence on the popular kids (he earns coolness points as a local baseball phenomenon), Josie gets inducted to the alpha crowd and unwittingly slights her ""uncool"" (second-time around) high school friends. Josie enjoys her English class and surprises her teacher, uber-handsome Sam Coulson, with her love for words and knowledge on the subject. Meanwhile, the Sun eavesdrops on Josie and her high school adventures.Sam (Michael Vartan), is noplussed by Josie's maturity yet apparent youth.  When he learns that Josie is an undercover reporter, he becomes hurt and angry.  Josie tries to apologize through the very tabloid that brought on her trouble--and readers anxiously await to see if Sam will meet Josie in a baseball stadium to deliver her first kiss before the appointed time.(Let me interject my two cents here: Michael Vartan is hot...he has my ideal body type, sigh...I was writhing with jealousy during the kissing scene!)This movie is hilarious and well-written.  It's been accused of being formulaic, but so what?  It has a good message and is very funny.My friends and I never tire of watching this movie, and the expression, ""Josie Grossie"" has taken on a life of its own. When we show pictures from our childhood to each other, we often qualify them as, ""This picture was taken from my Josie Grossie years.""  (You know, glasses, braces, bad hair, the works...)

Now high school is not a good memory for her b/c she was always made fun of in high school...she is dreading it, but tries to change (i.e. put on makeup, new clothes, new car) in order to fit in.

Barrymore's character is especially poignant when she  mentons how in the real world, no one cares if you were a nerd or a prom  queen, and she adequately expresses that there needs to be understanding  and kindness for everyone.Another important theme in the film is that  sometimes ethics and morality need to come before &quot;getting the  scoop.&quot; If only all journalists felt that way, the world would be much  better off.Yes this does appeal to teenagers and there are important issues  for them in it, but adults would do well to visit those issues as well, and  be entertained in the process.",5,Not Just For Kids,960336000,"06 7, 2000",2000,998,"['film', 'really', 'relate', 'was', 'not', 'popular', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'teased', 'when', 'quot', 'crowd', 'quot', 'found', 'liked', 'one', 'football', 'players', 'group', 'are', 'scenes', 'seem', 'outlandish', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'accurate', 'portrayl', 'cruelty', 'part', 'high', 'school', 'how', 'girl', 'just', 'be', 'accepted', 'popular', 'Barrymore', 'character', 'especially', 'poignant', 'when', 'how', 'real', 'world', 'one', 'were', 'nerd', 'prom', 'queen', 'adequately', 'be', 'understanding', 'kindness', 'everyone.Another', 'important', 'theme', 'film', 'sometimes', 'ethics', 'morality', 'need', 'come', 'quot', 'getting', 'scoop.', 'quot', 'only', 'journalists', 'felt', 'way', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'off.Yes', 'appeal', 'teenagers', 'are', 'important', 'issues', 'adults', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'visit', 'issues', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'entertained', 'process']",Never Been Kissed VHS

Many movies can get away with formulas and cliches, but not this one.There are two stories: one about cool kids and nerds, the other a love story. The cool kids are beautiful, dumb, and cruel, the nerds are unattractive, brainy, and kind. Josie - Drew Barrymore - is a nerd who was constantly abused by the cool kids when she was in high school. It seems that the cool kids had nothing better to do than to torture and humiliate Josie. Now that Josie is a 25-year-old newspaper copy editor - and still a virgin nerd - she is given her first journalistic assignment: to attend high school as an undercover student and produce a sensational story that will sell lots of papers. The only problem is that Josie is still a nerd, and she's no better at infiltrating the cool cabal than before. But that all begins to change when Josie eats a marijuana brownie. Deep inside the nerdish girl is a wild and crazy party girl desperate to get out, and it feels great when she does. And everyone likes the party girl better.Now the love story. There is one person who likes both the nerdy Josie and the wild and cool Josie: her 30-year-old Shakespeare teacher, who, by the way, is not a nerd but a cool teacher. I mean, he really likes her, and it shows. It almost seems that he's stalking her, because after school he's always where she is. But since the feelings are mutual, Josie doesn't mind. At the Senior Prom, while slow-dancing with Josie, the teacher is about to tell her how he feels, until she interrupts him because he is being recorded by the newspaper. In other words, Josie stops him from being caught committing a crime. Does Josie see any red flags that this teacher she loves is making moves on what he thinks is an underage high school student? No. Not only does she ignore the red flags, she makes a huge public display of their falling in love at the end of the movie, and everyone is ecstatic. Hey, what's more romantic than a cool high school teacher falling in love with a student?If in describing the absurdities of this movie I have made it sound less boring than it is, I'm sorry.

Would you do things differently or would you end up doing similar things that you did the first time around? I'm not really sure what I would do, but if I was given the opportunity to relive the high school years I don't know if I would even take it. However, that idea forms the foundation for the movie NEVER BEEN KISSED.Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) is an intelligent, beautiful, and hardworking woman who works at the Chicago Sun-Times. At twenty-five, she's also the youngest copy editor on staff. Josie likes her job, but what she really wants to do is be a reporter. She finally gets her opportunity when the owner of the paper gives her an assignment of going undercover as a high school student to find out what it's like to be a high school student in today's society. I mean, everybody forgets high school after they graduate so nobody has any idea what its like (ha, ha, ha). So, Josie enrolls and finds herself doing the exact same things she did when she was originally in school. Apparently people used to call her Josie ""Grossie"" back then and she still hasn't developed enough self-esteem to overcome those feelings of inadequacy. Josie finds herself developing an attraction to a handsome hunk of a teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan), but she can't do anything about her feelings without blowing her cover and getting Mr. Coulson in trouble. Of course, since Josie's job is also on the line because unless she starts hanging out where all the ""dirt"" is, aka the cheerleaders, preps, and jocks, she's going to get fired. Oh, and to top it all off, Josie has never been kissed.As a member of one of the only truly royal acting families in the U.S., Drew Barrymore has made quite a career for herself and has acting in around sixty different movies. Barrymore is one of those people who could do anything she wants and that's just what she did. She started a production company to develop original scripts written outside the system and the first project she chose to develop was NEVER BEEN KISSED. Perhaps Drew hasn't been getting many job offers or was just bored, but whatever the case she also cast herself in the lead role. Let's see USC is the top film school in the country, not much outside influence going to be happening there. The first movie chosen to develop is a romantic comedy. But get this, the lead is going to star Drew Barrymore as a woman who has never been kissed! How unbelievable can you get!I like Drew Barrymore. I really do. I first had a crush on her when I was a kid and saw her in E.T. But, Drew Barrymore as a girl who has never been kissed is as unrealistic and unbelievable as the moon being made of cheese.Of course, that's one of the more realistic things about this movie. The teacher that Josie likes makes advances at her. That has lawsuit written all over it. Everyone pretends its okay after Josie's true identity is real, but it's not okay. It's slightly deranged, immoral, and illegal. But then again the high school Josie attends is more of a college than a high school.Most of the acting in the film is dry and uninspiring. Barrymore is cute as usual, but cute doesn't carry a film unless you're a child actor. The only performance of any note is that of David Arquette who plays Josie's older brother, Robert, who was a popular kid in high school and never could let go of those moments that were the best of his life.Overall, NEVER BEEN KISSED is a formula romantic comedy that falls on its face. It's barely worth watching if you're a fan of Barrymore's.

There are quite a few unrealistic things pertaining to this movie, mostly with some of the students, some wardrobe issues, and other minor tidbits, but as a whole, it works and its very cute and touching.",4,A very sincere and cute film,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,772,"['viewing', 'first', 'time', 'must', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'impressed', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', '2nd', 'viewing', 'think', 'actually', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', 'clue', 'how', 'why', 'happened', 'know', 'great', 'inviting', 'type', 'film', 'deals', 'real', 'issues', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'great', 'awkward', 'cute', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'good', 'role', 'loved', 'High', 'School', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'such', 'great', 'storyline', 'comedy', 'based', 'high', 'school', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'unrealistic', 'things', 'pertaining', 'movie', 'mostly', 'students', 'wardrobe', 'issues', 'other', 'minor', 'tidbits', 'whole', 'very', 'cute', 'touching']",Never Been Kissed VHS

A former nerd is forced to go back to highschool as an undercover reporter and relive the traumas of her youth.  Predictably, she discovers more about herself than she does about any story and along the way she finds love in a most unexpected place.  This movie isn't too deep or that thought provoking, but it is a modern day 'fairy tale' with a happy ending that will leave you feeling good.

470194,A18RJ91B28WFJ2,630557605X,zebrastripes,"[1, 2]","I recently watched Never Been Kissed (DVD) at a family friend's home. While I had heard people talk about this movie before, I had never watched it myself. Which is surprising because I love movies set in high school. I think that Drew Barrymore came off as absolutely adorable and the 1980's soundtrack for this late 1990's movie was rather cute. Not to mention, I was already giggling from the very start!This movie is about a former high school nerd, now working as a reporter, whose job is to go back to high school and pose as a high school student. She crushes on a student, develops feelings for a teacher, and the goal of becoming popular is added to her job. Will she succeed? Well you must watch to discover. Or you know, you can just guess the predictable outcome. It really failed to grasp any of the same feelings from other high school movies around the time. For example, after watching Clueless, I did not feel clueless at the end. I really felt as if the main character learned a valuable lesson, matured, and was an all around positive role model for young girls. When I was watching this movie, I failed to feel the same way. The girl finds out that high school sucks just as much as she remembered and ends up romancing with her teacher. Which came off as very underdeveloped and dry romance, in my opinion.I feel like this movie, while enjoyable and cute, does not add anything new or exciting to the high school genre. It really follows the paint by numbers formula and, like I said before, struggled to win over my heart in the romances. I am really surprised this movie has somewhat of a cult following and feel like it is mostly because of Drew Barrymore's bubbly and likeable performance.Should you watch this? If you must. But do not go out of your way to see it. I have seen much better high school movies that have come before and after this.
