1455538,A3VP5SXUTKJFRW,B005DGKBC8,"C. DeGhoul ""urieldewolf""","[6, 8]","Man From Atlantis was a show I half-remembered from my childhood. I loved it as a kid but I found it a little difficult to watch as an adult. If nothing else, watching these DVDs showed me how much live video feed has helped the production of television shows and films. I could not help but shake my head when the water tank Patrick Duffy's character was in clearly showed water stains on the outside of the glass when he was supposed to be in the ocean, or the scurrying fin of one of his support divers who was not supposed to be there, or an underwater light showing up on-camera, or the blatant continuity glitches between wet hair/dry hair and so on. In modern filming, many of these problems could have been caught during filming with the help of live video feeds rather than having to wait until the film was processed -- when time and money restrictions caused them to become permanent goofs. As a child, I marvelled at Duffy's amazing (and changing) eye colors because I didn't know f/x lenses existed. As an adult, I see how bloodshoot his eyes are and respect what he endured with those glass contacts. As a child, the silliness of the plots and the sometimes wooden acting never bothered me. As an adult, it makes me chuckle that I could have ever been so naive. Still, there were moments when I was pleasantly surprised by the acting, a humorous line in the dialogue, the hint of an unexpected depth in a message(that may or may not have been deliberate), Mr. Duffy's endurance of eyes and lungs, and, for the era, the quality of the transfer to DVD for both sound and video. Also in the plus column was the ability to wistfully admire the handsome Mr. Duffy's lean, young, authentic swimmer's body forever captured at the height of his prime and the fact that, to this day, in the rare times I go for a swim, I STILL occasionally use the undulating body method of swimming underwater because it captured my imagination as a child and it actually does work as a means of propulsion.In short, I'd have to call it enjoyable - though flawed - fluff from a bygone era.",4,Good transfer but shattered illusions,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,2078,"['Man', 'Atlantis', 'was', 'show', 'half-remembered', 'childhood', 'loved', 'kid', 'found', 'little', 'difficult', 'watch', 'adult', 'nothing', 'else', 'watching', 'DVDs', 'showed', 'how', 'much', 'live', 'video', 'feed', 'helped', 'production', 'television', 'shows', 'films', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'shake', 'head', 'when', 'water', 'tank', 'Patrick', 'Duffy', 'character', 'was', 'clearly', 'showed', 'water', 'stains', 'outside', 'glass', 'when', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'ocean', 'scurrying', 'fin', 'one', 'support', 'divers', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'underwater', 'light', 'showing', 'up', 'on-camera', 'blatant', 'continuity', 'glitches', 'wet', 'hair/dry', 'hair', 'so', 'modern', 'filming', 'many', 'problems', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'filming', 'help', 'live', 'video', 'feeds', 'rather', 'having', 'wait', 'film', 'was', 'processed', 'when', 'time', 'money', 'restrictions', 'caused', 'become', 'permanent', 'goofs', 'child', 'marvelled', 'Duffy', 'amazing', 'changing', 'eye', 'colors', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'f/x', 'lenses', 'existed', 'adult', 'see', 'how', 'bloodshoot', 'eyes', 'are', 'respect', 'what', 'endured', 'glass', 'contacts', 'child', 'silliness', 'plots', 'sometimes', 'wooden', 'acting', 'never', 'bothered', 'adult', 'chuckle', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'so', 'naive', 'Still', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'acting', 'humorous', 'line', 'dialogue', 'hint', 'unexpected', 'depth', 'message', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'deliberate', 'Mr.', 'Duffy', 'endurance', 'eyes', 'lungs', 'era', 'quality', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'sound', 'video', 'Also', 'plus', 'column', 'was', 'ability', 'wistfully', 'admire', 'handsome', 'Mr.', 'Duffy', 'lean', 'young', 'authentic', 'swimmer', 'body', 'forever', 'captured', 'height', 'prime', 'fact', 'day', 'rare', 'times', 'go', 'swim', 'STILL', 'occasionally', 'use', 'undulating', 'body', 'method', 'swimming', 'underwater', 'captured', 'imagination', 'child', 'actually', 'work', 'means', 'propulsion.In', 'short', ""'d"", 'have', 'call', 'enjoyable', 'flawed', 'fluff', 'bygone', 'era']",Man From Atlantis: The Complete TV Movies Collection
1455539,A2OAAI7R7MMPBK,B005DGKBC8,"Christopher Nash ""misterphp""","[2, 2]","This 2 disc set contains the very best of The Man From Atlantis - the quartet of TV movies.  Sadly, when it went to standard 50 minute episodes, the quality dropped and most of the episodes were - frankly - awful.The opening pilot tells the story of a mysterious man, green eyed and with gills and webbed fingers, washed ashore and found by Navy doctor Elizabeth Merrill.  She realises he needs to immerse himself in water at regular intervals and may be the last survivor of Atlantis.  He learns to speak English and she gives him the name Mark Harris.  Mark agrees to undertake a mission for the Navy and this leads to his first encounter with the villainous Mr Schubert.The pilot is well made and handles the concept with considerable skill, though I think some acknowledgement should have been made to Marvel Comics - the character isn't a million miles away from Prince Namor, the Submariner.  In the second movie, Elizabeth has left the Navy and has joined the Foundation For Oceanic Research, taking Mark with her.  This introduces CW Crawford, their boss, and Elizabeth's partner Miller Simon.  This latter character would be written out after the four movies.  We also encounter the submarine Cetacean and it's crew - though after the movies the crew would be replaced by a new one.The 4 movies are all of a high standard and treat the concept seriously and intelligently.

Unlike its equally goofy contemporary, ""Wonder Woman,"" however, MFA is high-camp kitsch played with a totally straight face (especially by Patrick Duffy). In fact no one in the cast lets on that they are aware that they're involved in a show this cheap and dumb. And it's that very lack of awareness that makes up 95% of its charm. Seriously--on the quality scale, MFA is several notches below ""Jonny Quest"" and maybe a notch above ""Sigmund and the Sea Monsters.""And I have to say that I much prefer the shorter 47 minute series episodes to the three 70 minute TV movies that preceded them (the original pilot movie was actually fairly high quality).
