1108792,AGS2KVNMUCA48,B000WCN8QO,Furyan Goddess,"[24, 26]","This is a must see for any true Vin fans out there.  It truly shows him in a new light.His life, up until this point has been about sex, drugs, women, and beer along with his 'brothers' and friend.They all grew up with out their fathers in their lives and it seems that the only thing they have is each other.""Rick"" is the oldest of the group and it seems he's the only one that has some responsibility and vision for the future.  He's ready to grow up and leave his slutty ways behind.He wants to fall in love and he knows that after so many women in his bed, that's it's going to be hard to find a special woman because, they are too innocent and pure for someone like him to touch and bring down.He's a low level drug dealer and he ""Doesn't do this for a living"" but for some extra cash... though they never show any of them doing a REAL job and they never tell you what that job is.It's all lies, especially out of ""Tony's"" mouth.  He'll say anything or do anything to hook up with a woman and he had no remorse.  He finds it funny when he ends up catching something but Rick flips on him. Finally, well hopefully making the others in their group see the light.This is a very gritty, dirty and crass film.  It is not for the family.  It is unrated but it is about an NC-17.If you only want to see the sweet Pacifier side of Vin, then don't bother with this.  If you want to see what it was like growing up in NY in the mid 90 for a bunch of go no-wheres.  If you want to see the intelligence and seamless conversations, albeit vulgar conversations, between true friends then get this.Vin has so much talent and only a small part of that is show here.  He made this film with little more than 40 G's and I've seen million dollar films that make this one look like Oscar winning roles.Brilliant and raw.  And that ""Making of"" is nice to see.  Vin looks truly happy and it's almost as long as the film itself.",5,Vin shines but directing/writing is what's gonna make him a star!,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,1910,"['must', 'see', 'true', 'Vin', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'truly', 'new', 'light.His', 'life', 'up', 'point', 'been', 'sex', 'drugs', 'women', 'beer', ""'brothers"", 'friend.They', 'grew', 'up', 'out', 'fathers', 'lives', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'other', 'Rick', 'oldest', 'group', 'only', 'one', 'responsibility', 'vision', 'future', 'ready', 'grow', 'up', 'leave', 'slutty', 'ways', 'behind.He', 'fall', 'love', 'so', 'many', 'women', 'bed', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'special', 'woman', 'are', 'too', 'innocent', 'pure', 'someone', 'touch', 'bring', 'down.He', 'low', 'level', 'drug', 'dealer', ""n't"", 'do', 'living', 'extra', 'cash', 'never', 'show', 'doing', 'REAL', 'job', 'never', 'tell', 'what', 'job', 'is.It', 'especially', 'Tony', 'mouth', ""'ll"", 'say', 'anything', 'do', 'anything', 'hook', 'up', 'woman', 'had', 'remorse', 'funny', 'when', 'up', 'catching', 'something', 'Rick', 'flips', 'Finally', 'well', 'hopefully', 'making', 'others', 'group', 'see', 'light.This', 'very', 'gritty', 'dirty', 'crass', 'film', 'not', 'family', 'unrated', 'NC-17.If', 'only', 'want', 'see', 'sweet', 'Pacifier', 'side', 'Vin', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'NY', 'mid', '90', 'bunch', 'go', 'no-wheres', 'want', 'see', 'intelligence', 'seamless', 'conversations', 'vulgar', 'conversations', 'true', 'friends', 'then', 'get', 'this.Vin', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'show', 'here', 'made', 'film', 'little', 'more', '40', 'G', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'dollar', 'films', 'make', 'one', 'look', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'roles.Brilliant', 'raw', 'Making', 'nice', 'see', 'Vin', 'truly', 'happy', 'almost', 'as', 'long', 'film']",N/A
1108793,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000WCN8QO,Grady Harp,"[20, 25]","STRAYS (or DOORMEN as his script was initially titled) marks the entry of Vin Diesel (AKA Mark Sinclair Vincent) into the film world in a very small budget (under $50,000.), independent 1997 movie he wrote, directed and acted the major role.  To appreciate this very realistic, modest, slice of New York life the film presents, it helps to watch the features added to the DVD (the film is released to the public for the first time): interviews with the cast and with Diesel give a sensitive and heartwarming background that enhances the movie experience. Though Diesel studied acting and worked in theater in New York prior to this film, it was not until he made his own film that he captured the attention of the people who make things happen. And now that Vin Diesel is a major Hollywood presence it is fascinating to see this initial opener.The plot is simple enough: Rick (Diesel) is a minor drug dealer who also works as a bouncer with his buddy Tony (F. Valentino Morales), and hangs with Fred (Joey Dedio) and his 'brother' (Mike Epps, in his first role in film).  The guys live mainly for easy sex and camaraderie - all of the have been raised by mothers without knowing their fathers (thus, are 'strays'). As Rick matures he grows tired of his shallow lifestyle, misses the connection with his mother he never developed, and is prime bait for a relationship. Into his life steps Heather (Suzanne Lanza), a wholesome Midwestern girl, the two have a mutual attraction, but as their courtship dance progresses Heather disapproves of Rick's at times gang-like behavior and his drug dealing.  They come together in an extended park bench conversation (excellent writing)  during which they realize they each have repairs to do on their previous lives before they can enter a serious relationship.One aspect of this little film that makes it a cut above the many others like it is the quality of natural acting Diesel draws from his cast: uncredited female actors who provide the sex interest for the men are variably excellent, and Morales, Dedio and Lanza are particularly strong in their commitment to ensemble acting.  The script is fairly strong, though the barrage of expletives becomes tiresome after a while. Yet in the end, Diesel establishes his skills as a serious actor and as a fine director and writer, and for the chance to see one of Hollywood's major talents in his nascent stage, this film is well worth watching.

1108798,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000WCN8QO,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Strays (Vin Diesel, 1997)I have a strong suspicion, though I've never explicitly read this, that Strays was originally a short script, like Diesel's excellent first effort, Multi-Facial, that he extended to feature-length. It certainly feels that way while watching it, and given that Diesel hasn't picked up a camera in the intervening sixteen years--despite having prepared another script with the intention of directing it himself while Strays was in production--I think he may have learned some valuable lessons from that process, which is always fraught with peril for an inexperienced screenwriter.Plot: Rick (Diesel) is a layabout, a sometime drug dealer who has seen the error of his previous womanizing, hedonistic ways and is trying to straighten himself out while still dealing the occasional quarter of pot and still hanging out with the same band of stoners and no-goodniks from the bad old days: Freddie (Bomb the System's Joey Dedio), Mike (the screen debut of Next Friday's Mike Epps), and Tony (F. Valentino Morales, a partner of Diesel's from Multi-Facial all the way up through 2005's The Pacifier), among others. He's sick of the cruising scene, sick of the people he hangs out with, sick of life in general until Heather (The Night We Never Met's Suzanne Lanza in her final big-screen appearance, as of this writing), a small-town Girl Next Door(TM), moves into the brownstone next door. Rick and Heather hit it off after being introduced at a neighborhood party, but Rick's lifestyle, and the violence he is forced to display because of it, alienate her just as much as his softer side attracts.The good parts about this movie mirror the good parts of Multi-Facial; there's even that climactic monologue, though the piece here is far more pedestrian than the ""A Raisin in the Sun"" monologue Diesel delivers at the end of that film. And for me, that's ultimately why Strays falls flat; Diesel isn't really trying to do anything new here. It all still works, it's just working in identical ways, and it's stretched out to over four times the length. Some of the filler is good stuff; a subplot featuring Tony was lifted pretty much verbatim from Larry Clark's Kids, but it works (and honestly, it works a helluva lot better here than it did in that mess of a movie), and most of the scenes where Rick and the gang are just hanging out talking in the basketball court are good stuff; Diesel knows how to write dialogue, which may come as a surprise to those who only know him as a brainless-action-movie star. On the other hand, the rest of the filler doesn't work nearly as well--including the main romance plot. There's way too much expository stuff, people saying things that sound like they're coming out of psych 101 textbooks rather than off the tops of heads. Heather's conversation on the rooftop with the guy who introduced them? Good pebbles, that scene was a bust. (It didn't help that the male character there, whose name I have completely forgotten despite watching the movie less than twelve hours ago, is so flamboyantly gay as to be the same kind of brainless stereotype Diesel has, ironically, found himself shoehorned into since about xXx.) I think I actually cringed a couple of times while watching it. It's hard to believe that the same guy who penned the scenes about Ferdinand, the Munro Leaf kidlit classic about a bull who just wants to be loved, wrote that rooftop dialogue. (Not that the Ferdinand bits are any less heavy-handed, but at least they work within the context of the film in a way that scene never could.)Strays is a movie that wants to be so much more than it turned out to be. And to be fair, as much of a fan of Multi-Facial as I am, I wanted it to be that much more as well. So maybe I'm a touch more disappointed than the average film viewer who comes into this knowing the softer, earlier side of Vin Diesel will be. (The reaction on the IMDB boards from those who only know him as an action star, on the other hand, is uniformly rotten, so be warned.) I can't tell you not to see it; if you're a Vin Diesel fan (or a Mike Epps fan; his career exploded not long after this in exactly the same way Diesel's did), of course you're going to hunt it down, and you should. But gird your loins. **",2,The conversion from short to feature director was not perfect...,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,4255,"['Strays', 'Vin', 'Diesel', '1997', 'have', 'strong', 'suspicion', ""'ve"", 'never', 'explicitly', 'read', 'Strays', 'was', 'originally', 'short', 'script', 'Diesel', 'excellent', 'first', 'effort', 'Multi-Facial', 'extended', 'feature-length', 'certainly', 'way', 'watching', 'given', 'Diesel', ""n't"", 'picked', 'up', 'camera', 'intervening', 'sixteen', 'years', 'having', 'prepared', 'script', 'intention', 'directing', 'Strays', 'was', 'production', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'learned', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'process', 'always', 'fraught', 'peril', 'inexperienced', 'screenwriter.Plot', 'Rick', 'Diesel', 'layabout', 'sometime', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'seen', 'error', 'previous', 'womanizing', 'hedonistic', 'ways', 'trying', 'straighten', 'out', 'still', 'dealing', 'occasional', 'quarter', 'pot', 'still', 'hanging', 'out', 'same', 'band', 'stoners', 'no-goodniks', 'bad', 'old', 'days', 'Freddie', 'Bomb', 'System', 'Joey', 'Dedio', 'Mike', 'screen', 'debut', 'Next', 'Friday', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'Tony', 'F.', 'Valentino', 'Morales', 'partner', 'Diesel', 'Multi-Facial', 'way', '2005', 'Pacifier', 'others', 'sick', 'cruising', 'scene', 'sick', 'people', 'out', 'sick', 'life', 'general', 'Heather', 'Night', 'Never', 'Met', 'Suzanne', 'Lanza', 'final', 'big-screen', 'appearance', 'writing', 'small-town', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'TM', 'brownstone', 'next', 'door', 'Rick', 'Heather', 'hit', 'off', 'being', 'introduced', 'neighborhood', 'party', 'Rick', 'lifestyle', 'violence', 'forced', 'display', 'alienate', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'softer', 'side', 'attracts.The', 'good', 'parts', 'movie', 'good', 'parts', 'Multi-Facial', 'even', 'climactic', 'monologue', 'piece', 'here', 'far', 'more', 'pedestrian', 'A', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'monologue', 'Diesel', 'delivers', 'end', 'film', 'ultimately', 'why', 'Strays', 'flat', 'Diesel', ""n't"", 'really', 'trying', 'do', 'anything', 'new', 'here', 'still', 'just', 'working', 'identical', 'ways', 'stretched', 'out', 'four', 'times', 'length', 'filler', 'good', 'stuff', 'subplot', 'featuring', 'Tony', 'was', 'lifted', 'pretty', 'much', 'verbatim', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'Kids', 'honestly', 'helluva', 'lot', 'better', 'here', 'did', 'mess', 'movie', 'most', 'scenes', 'where', 'Rick', 'gang', 'are', 'just', 'hanging', 'out', 'talking', 'basketball', 'court', 'are', 'good', 'stuff', 'Diesel', 'how', 'write', 'dialogue', 'may', 'come', 'surprise', 'who', 'only', 'know', 'brainless-action-movie', 'star', 'other', 'hand', 'rest', 'filler', ""n't"", 'work', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'main', 'romance', 'plot', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'expository', 'stuff', 'people', 'saying', 'things', 'sound', ""'re"", 'coming', 'psych', '101', 'textbooks', 'rather', 'off', 'tops', 'heads', 'Heather', 'conversation', 'rooftop', 'guy', 'who', 'introduced', 'Good', 'pebbles', 'scene', 'was', 'bust', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'male', 'character', 'there', 'name', 'have', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'watching', 'movie', 'less', 'twelve', 'hours', 'ago', 'so', 'flamboyantly', 'gay', 'be', 'same', 'kind', 'brainless', 'stereotype', 'Diesel', 'ironically', 'found', 'shoehorned', 'xXx', 'think', 'actually', 'cringed', 'couple', 'times', 'watching', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'penned', 'scenes', 'Ferdinand', 'Munro', 'Leaf', 'kidlit', 'classic', 'bull', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'loved', 'wrote', 'rooftop', 'dialogue', 'Not', 'Ferdinand', 'bits', 'are', 'less', 'heavy-handed', 'least', 'work', 'context', 'film', 'way', 'scene', 'never', 'could', 'Strays', 'movie', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'be', 'fair', 'much', 'fan', 'Multi-Facial', 'am', 'wanted', 'be', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'as', 'well', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'touch', 'more', 'disappointed', 'average', 'film', 'viewer', 'who', 'knowing', 'softer', 'earlier', 'side', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'will', 'be', 'reaction', 'IMDB', 'boards', 'who', 'only', 'know', 'action', 'star', 'other', 'hand', 'uniformly', 'rotten', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'not', 'see', ""'re"", 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'fan', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'fan', 'career', 'exploded', 'not', 'long', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'Diesel', 'did', 'course', ""'re"", 'going', 'hunt', 'down', 'should', 'gird', 'loins', '**']",N/A
