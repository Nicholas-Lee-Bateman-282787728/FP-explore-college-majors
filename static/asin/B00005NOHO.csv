669486,A2RQS7X7FI3C6E,B00005NOHO,AAI,"[3, 3]","I reviewed season 1 of the Sopranos and I said that it was a modern masterpiece.  I still stay true to what I said with that. Season 2 carries story lines from Season 1and as with any piece of work the characters all progress.  We are introduced to new characters such as Richie Aprile & Janice Soprano.I think that the main theme of Season One was to introduce you to Tony and his crew and what they were about.  Season 2 goes deeper and I would say simply the main themes are that Tony has a huge mess on his hands. If you don't want to spoil things don't read the rest of this paragraph.  He still doesn't know what causes his panic attacks and Dr. Melfi doesn't want to treat him.His sister Janice is in town from Seattle and she is being a pain in Tony's ass by trying to take their mom's house and her inheritance.  Tony's old friend Richie, brother of the late former mob boss Jackie, is in town and he wants a big piece of action and wants what Tony has.  Most of all Tony is trying to figure out if he has a rat on his hands with Big Puss.  With that said there are alot of other themes going on but those are the biggies.This season transends perfectly from season 1 and it is the second best season of the show.  It never will bore you (atleast not for me).  All of the characters mature and grow.Now that I said my piece for season two, I will discuss a bit about the actual dvds.  The Soprano's Season 2 was released back in late 2001 and it is a four disk set.  The menus are animated nicely and look pretty slick.  The downside is that there aren't many special features and I think that they could have created a few for the viewers.  I mean there is a featurette that is pretty boring and a few directors commentaries.  Nothing really special in that department.This season is definetly worth your money, even though it is quite expensive.  I suggest you buy Season 1 before buying this season.  Just so you know whats going on.  This is a great season and there are a few plot twists and the season finale of this show is memorable and might be the image of the show.  So buy it now you will not regret it if you are a fan of the show, mafia movies, great acting, and dark humor.",5,A great second Season,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,2197,"['reviewed', 'season', '1', 'Sopranos', 'said', 'was', 'modern', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'stay', 'true', 'what', 'said', 'Season', '2', 'story', 'lines', 'Season', '1and', 'piece', 'work', 'characters', 'progress', 'are', 'introduced', 'new', 'characters', 'such', 'Richie', 'Aprile', 'Janice', 'Soprano.I', 'think', 'main', 'theme', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'introduce', 'Tony', 'crew', 'what', 'were', 'about', 'Season', '2', 'deeper', 'would', 'say', 'simply', 'main', 'themes', 'are', 'Tony', 'huge', 'mess', 'hands', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'rest', 'paragraph', 'still', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'panic', 'attacks', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', ""n't"", 'want', 'treat', 'him.His', 'sister', 'Janice', 'town', 'Seattle', 'being', 'pain', 'Tony', 'ass', 'trying', 'take', 'mom', 'house', 'inheritance', 'Tony', 'old', 'friend', 'Richie', 'brother', 'late', 'former', 'mob', 'boss', 'Jackie', 'town', 'big', 'piece', 'action', 'what', 'Tony', 'Most', 'Tony', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'rat', 'hands', 'Big', 'Puss', 'said', 'are', 'alot', 'other', 'themes', 'going', 'are', 'biggies.This', 'season', 'perfectly', 'season', '1', 'second', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'never', 'will', 'bore', 'not', 'characters', 'mature', 'grow.Now', 'said', 'piece', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'discuss', 'bit', 'actual', 'dvds', 'Soprano', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'released', 'back', 'late', '2001', 'four', 'disk', 'set', 'menus', 'are', 'animated', 'nicely', 'look', 'pretty', 'slick', 'downside', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'special', 'features', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'created', 'few', 'viewers', 'mean', 'featurette', 'pretty', 'boring', 'few', 'directors', 'commentaries', 'Nothing', 'really', 'special', 'department.This', 'season', 'definetly', 'worth', 'money', 'even', 'quite', 'expensive', 'suggest', 'buy', 'Season', '1', 'buying', 'season', 'Just', 'know', 'whats', 'going', 'great', 'season', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'twists', 'season', 'finale', 'show', 'memorable', 'might', 'be', 'image', 'show', 'So', 'buy', 'now', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'mafia', 'movies', 'great', 'acting', 'dark', 'humor']",N/A
669487,AK2Q7ML2RANDN,B00005NOHO,A. Eby,"[0, 0]","The second season of ""The Sopranos"" is just as dynamic as the first. Life is still complicated for Tony, only more so these days. He's still got problems with his mother, problems with Uncle Junior, plus his older sister Janice has showed up and is rekindling a romance with Richie Aprile, Jackie's explosive older brother and Tony's new nemesis. Dr. Melfi, still scared from having to go on the lam last season, refuses to see him. And Big P. is acting funny. Things are about as usual.Season two is infinitely more frustrating than season one. Tony's problems keep multiplying, stacking up one on top of the other. Nothing seems to get resolved, neatly or otherwise. As such, it's not quite as easy to watch. Yet, the show's quality has diminished not one iota. The writing is just as sharp, and the acting is quite simply superb. Lorraine Bracco's role as Melfi is expanded as we see her in therapy (Peter Bogdanovich is excellent as her therapist, Dr. Kupferberg), haggling over substance abuse issues and her conflictions over whether or not to treat Tony. Edie Falco continues to be perfect as Carmela, and James Gandolfini seethes inwardly as Tony, perhaps the most conflicted mobster we've ever watched.

669488,ATHNYP7D3RW1A,B00005NOHO,A. Gavin,"[2, 2]","With season 2, The Sopranos takes the formula they successfully developed in season 1 and really notches it up.While the foundation of fun characters is great, fundamentally I think the improvement has to do with a slight toning down of the comic element (it's still there, just slightly muted), and a concentration on the mob aspects at slight expense of Tony's maternal and psychiatric relationships. It's not to say that any major elements changed, the writers merely tuned up the balance.The mob stuff is great this time around. First of all, we have a lot more violence. It actually feels pretty real. This underscores a fundamental aspect of the show, in that we are made to become very fond of a bunch of ""cold hearted killers."" I'm not personally sure that this is unrealistic because everyone's the hero in their own story. In any case, there are some great episodes here.I particularly enjoyed ""Commendatori"" in which Tony, Chris, and Pauli go to Napoli for a little pow-pow with some old country gangsters. Having spent some time in Naples, this is extremely well handled, showing off that ancient city's blend of violence, seediness, and beauty. ""D-Girl,"" is another really fun episode. This is predominantly a Christopher show, and in the first season his subplots were dull, but maybe it's just living in Hollywood, or perhaps that I know Jon Favreau myself (he's a friend of a friend), but I found it sexy and amusing.A few new characters spice things up. I'm not that big a fan of Tony's sister Janice, but Richie Aprile is awesome. Channeling a very short Al Pacino, he's quite a character. This couple follow in Tony's Ma's tradition of stirring up trouble, both serious and comic. It all gets a little twisted -- particularly his mafioso-style bedroom fetish.Particularly in the first half of the season, there isn't much for Dr. Melfi to do, and during the second she arcs in a way I didn't find realistic. Family life and relationships are still paramount, but juicing up the crime intensity a bit, I felt improved the balance, moving things closer to the modern HBO style of great writing, great action, and shock.",5,Ups the ante,1306454400,"05 27, 2011",2011,2136,"['season', '2', 'Sopranos', 'formula', 'successfully', 'developed', 'season', '1', 'really', 'notches', 'foundation', 'fun', 'characters', 'great', 'fundamentally', 'think', 'improvement', 'do', 'slight', 'toning', 'comic', 'element', 'still', 'there', 'just', 'slightly', 'muted', 'concentration', 'mob', 'slight', 'expense', 'Tony', 'maternal', 'psychiatric', 'relationships', 'not', 'say', 'major', 'elements', 'changed', 'writers', 'merely', 'tuned', 'up', 'balance.The', 'mob', 'stuff', 'great', 'time', 'around', 'First', 'all', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'violence', 'actually', 'pretty', 'real', 'fundamental', 'aspect', 'show', 'are', 'made', 'become', 'very', 'fond', 'bunch', 'cold', 'hearted', 'killers', ""'m"", 'not', 'personally', 'sure', 'unrealistic', 'everyone', 'hero', 'own', 'story', 'case', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'here.I', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Commendatori', 'Tony', 'Chris', 'Pauli', 'go', 'Napoli', 'little', 'pow-pow', 'old', 'country', 'gangsters', 'Having', 'spent', 'time', 'Naples', 'extremely', 'well', 'handled', 'showing', 'off', 'ancient', 'city', 'blend', 'violence', 'seediness', 'beauty', 'D-Girl', 'really', 'fun', 'episode', 'predominantly', 'Christopher', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'subplots', 'were', 'dull', 'just', 'living', 'Hollywood', 'perhaps', 'know', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'friend', 'friend', 'found', 'sexy', 'amusing.A', 'few', 'new', 'characters', 'spice', 'things', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Tony', 'sister', 'Janice', 'Richie', 'Aprile', 'awesome', 'Channeling', 'very', 'short', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'quite', 'character', 'couple', 'follow', 'Tony', 'Ma', 'tradition', 'stirring', 'up', 'trouble', 'serious', 'comic', 'little', 'twisted', 'particularly', 'mafioso-style', 'bedroom', 'fetish.Particularly', 'first', 'half', 'season', ""n't"", 'much', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', 'do', 'second', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'realistic', 'Family', 'life', 'relationships', 'are', 'still', 'paramount', 'juicing', 'up', 'crime', 'intensity', 'bit', 'felt', 'improved', 'balance', 'moving', 'things', 'closer', 'modern', 'HBO', 'style', 'great', 'writing', 'great', 'action', 'shock']",N/A

669493,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005NOHO,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Like I said in my review for season one, I battled even attempting at reviewing this orgasmic series for the sheer fear of doing it wrong.  Really, there is nothing bad to be said for this amazing series and it's so important to me that I do this justice.  I hope and pray that I don't screw these up.So, what's in store for the viewers of season two?Picking up where season one left off, season two of the masterpiece series `The Sopranos' finds Tony Soprano stepping in as acting boss of the family while Uncle Junior faces federal indictment charges.  With this new position comes much more responsibility, responsibility that certainly has its price.  The decisions Tony makes have an impact on the entire family and there are some who have their ideas of how Tony should or shouldn't be running things.  But, just like in season one there is much more to this than mob action.  In fact, the real heart of this series is what happens within the Soprano home, and Tony's sister Janice makes for nice water cooler gossip as the new addition to the household.  She's greedy and selfish and downright detestable, and Tony knows this.  Not only does he have to battle with the likes of his sister but even him mother who took out a hit on Tony in season one is causing him grief.  With her condition after her stroke Tony is forced to put her in a nursing home mainly so he won't have to deal with her himself.She's dead to him, and he makes that very obvious.There are plenty of new faces appearing (and even disappearing) within season two.  First of all Pussy returns after disappearing for the last few episodes of season one.  There is much controversy over his sudden appearance especially since Tony was sick with grief over his disappearance.  His loyalty is called into question and it's a question that's held in the balance well into the season finale.  The previous family boss Jackie Aprile's brother Richie returns after serving ten years in prison and he's insistent on getting a large part of the pie.  His influence is destructive and it causes turmoil within the family, especially after he rekindles his relationship with Janice.  Tony also gets himself a new ally, Furio, straight from Italy, and his help is immediately apparent.There are also new occurrences between those not directly related to the mob.  A high school friend of Tony's, David Scatino, with a gambling problem ends up causing Tony grief when he borrows too much and can't pay it back.  Paying back his debt will prove disastrous for himself and for Tony as well, but that's to be seen.  There are issues within his own home to contend with, mostly dealing with his son's lack of care or concern.  There's also a struggle to get Meadow into a college close to home and this causes Carmela to finally show us what she's made of.  As Tony's relationship with Doctor Melfi grows she ends up suffering from her own vises and seeks help as well.There is actually so much that takes place within this season (and every season really) that breaking it all down would be time consuming and really pointless.  The whole reason to watch this show is to experience it and how can you experience it if you know it all before it happens.  I hope I haven't ruined anything for you.The acting this season is just as brilliant.  James Gandolfini proves once again that he is an acting god and that his portrayal of Tony Soprano is as real and as convincing as it could ever be.  He continues to strip away the layers of this man and expose him for who he really is and that is so commendable.  Edie Falco also ups her game with this season as Carmela.  She really makes this character her own as the seasons progress.  As far as the new faces are concerned David Proval is brilliant as Richie Aprile.  He's the perfect portrayal of pure scum.  Aida Turturro is phenomenal as Janice and she only gets better as time progresses.  She's able to make you hate her even though you long to watch her.  Robert Patrick, an actor whom I just adore, is fantastic as David Scatino.  He plays the man down on his luck brilliantly.  You can feel his pain and you can feel his frustration.  Vincent Pastore returns as Pussy and he really serves up his A-Game this season.  His character really evolves and gets fleshed out beautifully and really leaves a lasting impression.Season two is filled with the same emotional depth we received in season one, maybe even more so this go around.I've said this once before, `The Sopranos' is television perfection.  It will never be repeated and it will never be beaten.  Television will never be the same.  We have the reruns though and we have these beautifully compiled DVD's to keep us happy so that the memories will never die.  Until my review of season three, I hope this has proved helpful.",5,Without doubt the greatest show to ever grace the small screen...here's second helpings...,1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,4796,"['said', 'review', 'season', 'one', 'battled', 'even', 'attempting', 'reviewing', 'orgasmic', 'series', 'sheer', 'fear', 'doing', 'wrong', 'Really', 'nothing', 'bad', 'be', 'said', 'amazing', 'series', 'so', 'important', 'do', 'justice', 'hope', 'pray', 'do', ""n't"", 'screw', 'up.So', 'what', 'store', 'viewers', 'season', 'two', 'Picking', 'up', 'where', 'season', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'season', 'two', 'masterpiece', 'series', 'Sopranos', 'finds', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'stepping', 'acting', 'boss', 'family', 'Uncle', 'Junior', 'federal', 'indictment', 'charges', 'new', 'position', 'much', 'more', 'responsibility', 'responsibility', 'certainly', 'price', 'decisions', 'Tony', 'have', 'impact', 'entire', 'family', 'are', 'who', 'have', 'ideas', 'how', 'Tony', 'should', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'running', 'things', 'just', 'season', 'one', 'much', 'more', 'mob', 'action', 'fact', 'real', 'heart', 'series', 'what', 'Soprano', 'home', 'Tony', 'sister', 'Janice', 'nice', 'water', 'cooler', 'gossip', 'new', 'addition', 'household', 'greedy', 'selfish', 'downright', 'detestable', 'Tony', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'battle', 'likes', 'sister', 'even', 'mother', 'who', 'took', 'out', 'hit', 'Tony', 'season', 'one', 'causing', 'grief', 'condition', 'stroke', 'Tony', 'forced', 'put', 'nursing', 'home', 'mainly', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'deal', 'himself.She', 'dead', 'very', 'are', 'plenty', 'new', 'appearing', 'even', 'disappearing', 'season', 'two', 'First', 'Pussy', 'returns', 'disappearing', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'much', 'controversy', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'especially', 'Tony', 'was', 'sick', 'grief', 'disappearance', 'loyalty', 'called', 'question', 'question', 'held', 'balance', 'well', 'season', 'finale', 'previous', 'family', 'Jackie', 'Aprile', 'brother', 'Richie', 'returns', 'serving', 'ten', 'years', 'prison', 'insistent', 'getting', 'large', 'part', 'pie', 'influence', 'destructive', 'turmoil', 'family', 'especially', 'relationship', 'Janice', 'Tony', 'also', 'new', 'ally', 'Furio', 'straight', 'Italy', 'help', 'immediately', 'are', 'also', 'new', 'occurrences', 'not', 'directly', 'related', 'mob', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'Tony', 'David', 'Scatino', 'gambling', 'problem', 'up', 'causing', 'Tony', 'grief', 'when', 'too', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'back', 'Paying', 'back', 'debt', 'will', 'prove', 'disastrous', 'Tony', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'seen', 'are', 'issues', 'own', 'home', 'contend', 'mostly', 'dealing', 'son', 'lack', 'care', 'concern', 'also', 'struggle', 'get', 'Meadow', 'college', 'close', 'home', 'Carmela', 'finally', 'show', 'what', 'made', 'Tony', 'relationship', 'Doctor', 'Melfi', 'up', 'suffering', 'own', 'vises', 'help', 'well.There', 'actually', 'so', 'much', 'place', 'season', 'season', 'really', 'breaking', 'down', 'would', 'be', 'time', 'consuming', 'really', 'pointless', 'whole', 'reason', 'watch', 'show', 'experience', 'how', 'can', 'experience', 'know', 'hope', 'have', ""n't"", 'ruined', 'anything', 'you.The', 'acting', 'season', 'just', 'brilliant', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'once', 'again', 'acting', 'god', 'portrayal', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'real', 'as', 'convincing', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'strip', 'away', 'layers', 'man', 'expose', 'who', 'really', 'so', 'commendable', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'also', 'ups', 'game', 'season', 'Carmela', 'really', 'character', 'own', 'seasons', 'progress', 'As', 'far', 'new', 'are', 'concerned', 'David', 'Proval', 'brilliant', 'Richie', 'Aprile', 'perfect', 'portrayal', 'pure', 'scum', 'Aida', 'Turturro', 'phenomenal', 'Janice', 'only', 'better', 'time', 'able', 'make', 'hate', 'even', 'long', 'watch', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'actor', 'whom', 'just', 'adore', 'fantastic', 'David', 'Scatino', 'man', 'down', 'luck', 'brilliantly', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'can', 'feel', 'frustration', 'Vincent', 'Pastore', 'returns', 'Pussy', 'really', 'up', 'A-Game', 'season', 'character', 'really', 'fleshed', 'out', 'beautifully', 'really', 'lasting', 'impression.Season', 'two', 'filled', 'same', 'emotional', 'depth', 'received', 'season', 'one', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'go', 'around.I', ""'ve"", 'said', 'once', 'Sopranos', 'television', 'perfection', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'repeated', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'beaten', 'Television', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'have', 'reruns', 'have', 'beautifully', 'compiled', 'DVD', 'keep', 'happy', 'memories', 'will', 'never', 'die', 'review', 'season', 'three', 'hope', 'proved', 'helpful']",N/A

If course one capo is hit in the 1st fifteen minutes and Hesh shows up with his lawyer friend and more insightful advice. The Soprano family soap opera is interesting not just because of the writing but because the acting, all the way around, is far beyond anything soaps have seen before. Even when the characters are despicable, and many are, the acting is so convincing it would at least carry the show if it had to which it doesn't. The personalities are all interesting. Many are intriguing. If the major networks had any thoughts about upgrading their swill this show would be a great place to start. Along with the convincing acting and complex but believable, though sometimes semi-surrealistic, subplots the production and cinematography is superb. Probably the only real low point is the racial stereotypes introduced to pander to a wider demographic.Most shows that  bring in new characters after the first season do it because the essential ones have been taken as far as they can and have become dead weight. This usually means Lenny and Squiggy types will be written along with Mr. Furley or Mr Death Knell-Ted McGinley. With The Sopranos that isn't the case... ever. All characters, even the newer ones, are written well with personalities these actors have obviously been properly cast for. Once again the characters that are essentially useless are walk on stereotypes. The good part is that they're only there to move the plot along and then they go away. The instances where they are kept on, invariably to move along another subplot, are the times even a Sopranos fan will wonder why. To sell more toothpaste and fried chicken of course!

The psychiatrist angle, which gets all the attention, is really the least interesting part of the show.

A cross between The Godfather and the traditional nuclear sitcom family, the show provided a unique experience for a niche audience that quickly developed into a barrage of dedicated fans. Nominated for countless Emmy's, and winner of at least four in every one of its seasons except Season 2 (in which it carried home one), The Sopranos has cemented itself as one of the elite shows in television history...Golden Globe performer James Gandolfini plays the title role of Tony Soprano, a middle-aged father of two, loving husband, and successful businessman. But contrary to a typical sitcom, Tony finds himself irritated by his kids Anthony and Meadow (Robert Iler and Jamie Lynn Sigler), he cheats on his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), and the business organization responsible for his success is the mafia (of which he is the local boss). All the confusion in Tony's life leads to massive amounts of stress, prompting him to regularly visit a therapist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) - one of the few outsiders he trusts. Following a classic prime time soap opera format, quite similar to the hit TV show Dallas, The Sopranos provides audiences with a glimpse into the life and times of a mafia boss, where we find out that being a mob kingpin isn't the glamour life often portrayed in the movies...The Sopranos (Season 2) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist's Office"" in which Tony firmly establishes himself as the leader of the New Jersey area while Dr. Melfi starts seeing a therapist of her own in order to deal with the guilt she feels for refusing to treat Tony professionally. Meanwhile, Christopher's criminal enterprises in the ""boiler room"" bring thug violence into a professional workplace... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Commendatori"" in which Tony takes a business trip to Italy with Christopher and Paulie, and ""Full Leather Jacket"" in which Carmela uses the power of her status as Tony's wife to get a friend to write a letter of recommendation for Meadow...Below is a list of episodes included on The Sopranos (Season 2) DVD:Episode 14 (Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist's Office)Episode 15 (Do Not Resuscitate)Episode 16 (Toodle-F***ing-Oo)Episode 17 (Commendatori)Episode 18 (Big Girls Don't Cry)Episode 19 (The Happy Wanderer)Episode 20 (D-Girl)Episode 21 (Full Leather Jacket)Episode 22 (From Where to Eternity)Episode 23 (Bust Out)Episode 24 (House Arrest)Episode 25 (Knight in White Satin Armor)Episode 26 (Funhouse)The DVD Report",5,A truly great series...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2691,"['Sex', 'City', 'HBO', 'original', 'series', 'Sopranos', 'took', 'world', 'storm', 'late-1990s', 'cutting', 'edge', 'drama', 'acerbic', 'wit', 'cross', 'Godfather', 'traditional', 'nuclear', 'sitcom', 'family', 'show', 'provided', 'unique', 'experience', 'niche', 'audience', 'quickly', 'developed', 'barrage', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'Nominated', 'countless', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'least', 'four', 'one', 'seasons', 'Season', '2', 'carried', 'home', 'one', 'Sopranos', 'cemented', 'one', 'elite', 'television', 'history', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'performer', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'title', 'role', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'middle-aged', 'father', 'two', 'loving', 'husband', 'successful', 'businessman', 'contrary', 'typical', 'sitcom', 'Tony', 'irritated', 'kids', 'Anthony', 'Meadow', 'Robert', 'Iler', 'Jamie', 'Lynn', 'Sigler', 'wife', 'Carmela', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'business', 'organization', 'responsible', 'success', 'mafia', 'local', 'boss', 'confusion', 'Tony', 'life', 'massive', 'amounts', 'stress', 'prompting', 'regularly', 'visit', 'therapist', 'Dr.', 'Jennifer', 'Melfi', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'one', 'few', 'outsiders', 'Following', 'classic', 'prime', 'time', 'soap', 'opera', 'format', 'quite', 'similar', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'Dallas', 'Sopranos', 'audiences', 'glimpse', 'life', 'times', 'mafia', 'boss', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'being', 'mob', 'kingpin', ""n't"", 'glamour', 'life', 'often', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'Sopranos', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Guy', 'Walks', 'Psychiatrist', 'Office', 'Tony', 'firmly', 'leader', 'New', 'Jersey', 'area', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', 'seeing', 'therapist', 'own', 'order', 'deal', 'guilt', 'refusing', 'treat', 'Tony', 'professionally', 'Meanwhile', 'Christopher', 'criminal', 'enterprises', 'boiler', 'room', 'bring', 'thug', 'violence', 'professional', 'workplace', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'Commendatori', 'Tony', 'business', 'trip', 'Italy', 'Christopher', 'Paulie', 'Full', 'Leather', 'Jacket', 'Carmela', 'power', 'status', 'Tony', 'wife', 'get', 'friend', 'write', 'letter', 'recommendation', 'Meadow', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Sopranos', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'Episode', '14', 'Guy', 'Walks', 'Psychiatrist', 'Office', 'Episode', '15', 'Do', 'Not', 'Resuscitate', 'Episode', '16', 'Toodle-F***ing-Oo', 'Episode', '17', 'Commendatori', 'Episode', '18', 'Big', 'Girls', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Episode', '19', 'Happy', 'Wanderer', 'Episode', '20', 'D-Girl', 'Episode', '21', 'Full', 'Leather', 'Jacket', 'Episode', '22', 'Where', 'Eternity', 'Episode', '23', 'Bust', 'Out', 'Episode', '24', 'House', 'Arrest', 'Episode', '25', 'Knight', 'White', 'Satin', 'Armor', 'Episode', '26', 'Funhouse', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

Another story line involves Tony's sister Janice (Aida Turturro) and her boyfriend Richie Aprile, who has just spent ten years in prison. David Proval brilliantly portrays Richie as a blunt, brutal man. Almost no wit. Not at all subtle. Will Janice and Richie wed or does someone end up dead? That is the question.Tony's nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli) is emerging as a major player. Imperioli does masterful work here. Christopher is not very bright, prone to acting prior to thinking.  A genuine loose cannon, but he struggles to maintain self control because he is determined to move up. An organization man. He seems to be loyal to Uncle Tony, but loyalty only goes so far with this gang. And that's one of the things I like about this series. There is no attempt to romanticize anyone. Despite all the embracing and words about eternal loyalty, they are all heartless and afraid.Never a dull moment",5,Never a Dull Moment,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,1043,"['just', 'finished', 'second', 'season', 'collection', 'One', 'guys', 'caught', 'wiretap', 'feds', 'had', 'powerful', 'hold', 'story', 'line', 'Tony', 'sister', 'Janice', 'Aida', 'Turturro', 'boyfriend', 'Richie', 'Aprile', 'who', 'just', 'spent', 'ten', 'years', 'prison', 'David', 'Proval', 'brilliantly', 'Richie', 'blunt', 'brutal', 'man', 'Almost', 'wit', 'Not', 'subtle', 'Will', 'Janice', 'Richie', 'wed', 'someone', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'question.Tony', 'nephew', 'Christopher', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'emerging', 'major', 'player', 'Imperioli', 'masterful', 'work', 'here', 'Christopher', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'prone', 'acting', 'prior', 'thinking', 'genuine', 'loose', 'cannon', 'maintain', 'control', 'determined', 'move', 'up', 'organization', 'man', 'be', 'loyal', 'Uncle', 'Tony', 'loyalty', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'gang', 'one', 'things', 'like', 'series', 'attempt', 'romanticize', 'anyone', 'embracing', 'words', 'eternal', 'loyalty', 'are', 'heartless', 'afraid.Never', 'dull', 'moment']",N/A

The second season is often considered to be the best of the series by most fans and it's hard to argue with that assessment. For example, one of the two-season long storylines - is Pussy a rat? - is resolved, but not in a quick and fleeting fashion; it is carefully built up over the course of the year and leads to a devastating emotional payoff that will haunt Tony forever. Here are brief capsules for each episode in this excellent outing for Chase and Co.:Episode 1 - ""A Guy Walks Into A Pyschiatrist's Office..."" - Uncle Junior is in prison, Melfi has flown the coop, and Pussy returns from his mysterious vacation. Naturally, Tony's anger issues resurface. Christopher's new brokerage license fails to pay dividends for his employess, courtesy of two new incredibly stupid goons, Matt Bevelaqua and Sean Gismonte. To top it all off, Livia is in the hospital and her psychological double, Tony's sister Janice, is suddenly very interested in the family again (and their assets, of course). Fantastic first episode; all set-up but doesn't play like it.Episode 2 - ""Do Not Resuscitate"" - (SPOILER) We learn the sad truth about Pussy - he is indeed a rat. Notice that the creators do it early in the season instead of keeping us guessing - it allows the tension of what Tony suspects to amp up for the ENTIRE season. It was a great choice to make, and allows us a lot more insight into Pussy as well as a little fun. Also, we see AJ blurt out again to Livia, with hilarious results.Episode 3 - ""Toodle-(bleeping)-OO"" - The colorful title is misleading; Jackie Aprile's brother, Richie, is out of the can isn't wasting any time reclaiming his turf. Tony isn't too happy, and Richie still thinks of him as a kid. Not a good harbinger for Richie. Also, Meadow is caught partying at Livia's house, which leads to tensions between Tony, Carmela, and Janice. And Dr. Melfi is caught in an embarrassing situation.Episode 4 - ""Commendatori"" - A fun episode as Tony, Paulie, and Christopher visit Don Zi Vittorio in Italy to jump start a car operation they ""inherited"" from Junior. All three get more than they bargained for - Tony discovers the Don is a doddering old fool and his gorgeous and fierce daughter, Annalisa, is actually running things; Paulie finds his attempts at hospitality repeatedly thwarted; and Christopher shoots a LOT of heroin. But the trip is a success also yields a valuable new soldier, Furio. On the home front, Carmela is forced to question her own marriage as Angie Bompensiero, Pussy's wife, seeks a divorce. And Pussy is preoccupied with and Elvis impersonator who saw him with an agent.Episode 5 - ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" - A power structure is in place and Pussy isn't in the loop. Furio's up to his name as the new Italian lieutenant yields immediate, violent dividends in a collections dispute. Chris is taking acting classes, a gift from Adriana, but is he really cut out for it? Tony goes to Hesh for ""advice"" and learns his father had blackouts as well. Dr. Melfi decides to take Tony back as a patient, just in time.Episode 6 - ""The Happy Wanderer"" - Tony has taken over the executive poker game, formerly Junior's, that got him ""made"" - when he successfully robbed it without killing anyone. Big stakes are involved (Frank Sinatra Jr. is at the table), and Tony's old school friend Dave Scatino is desperate to get in. Problem is, he's a gambling addict and is already into Richie for too many ""boxes of ziti"". He adds onto the bill, this time with Tony, and it's going to cost him - bigtime.Episode 7 - ""D-Girl"" - Ugh. After so many great ones in a row, I almost forgot about this one, almost universally considered the worst Sopranos ep ever. AJ has suddenly become a nihilist and smokes pot at his confirmation. The FBI wants Pussy to wear a wire - since he's the confirmation sponsor. But mostly, the episode focuses on Chris' misadventures in Hollywood. Midly funny but mostly pointless diversion with little meat.Episode 8 - ""Full Leather Jacket"" - Carmela wants Meadow to get into Georgetown and ""requests"" a letter of recommendation from her terrifed neighbor Jeannie Cusamano, who's sister was a prominent student there. Richie Aprile gives an unsolicited gift to Tony, and it ends up causing a great deal more harm than good for both of them. And Matt and Sean do something completely moronic, with kills one of them and puts a bullseye on the other, and Christopher is the one worse for wear. Very dramatic but also funny bits, in the unique Sopranos mold.Episode 9 - ""From Where To Eternity"" - Christopher is on life support at the hospital and Bevilacqua is a marked man. The family - both of them - are coping in different ways. Carmela turns to prayer, for Chris and also Tony. Paulie, totally spooked by a vision of Christopher's, goes to a medium with predictably hilarious results. Pussy tries to get back in Tony's good graces by doing the hit on Matt with him, to the great consternation of the FBI. And Janice Soprano is trying to pull a Lady Macbeth on Ritchie. Life for Tony is never easy...Episode 10 - ""Bust-Out"" - Tony hears the worst news possible - there was a witness to the Bevilacqua murder. Now he needs cash and plans to skip town before the feds indict, which also means ""busting out"" Dave Scatino. Carmela gets flirtatious with her new decorator but when he learns who her husband is he has a sudden change of heart. And lucky for Tony (and Pussy), the witness has one, too.Episode 11 - ""House Arrest"" - After the Bevilacqua episode, Tony is warned by his lawyer Neil Mink to start spending more time away from the Bada Bing. He goes to the waste management business for a while - but finds it boring save for the secretary. Richie and Junior decide to sell coke on the garbage routes as well and Tony is furious. Junior also runs into an old friend while under house arrest and reconnects for a while.Episode 12 - ""The Knight In White Satin Armor"" - A decision needs to made about Richie Aprile. He conspires with Junior to attack Tony, but Junior smartly tips off his nephew for a greater long-term benefit. Richie is taken care off, in an unexpected way. Tony's goomah Irina is also giving him agita as he tries to break it off. Now only one problem is left - Big Pussy.Episode 13 - ""Funhouse"" - In perhaps the strongest episode in Sopranos history, the season finale ties up all the unresolved storylines from this season and the previous one. Tony still has his mother to deal with; of course she foolishly gets caught with stolen airplane tickets. He also gets ill from some Indian food, and his subconscious shows him things he doesn't want to confront. He fears the worst and goes with Silvio to investigate; they confirm the truth about Pussy. Along with Paulie, they take Pussy on a bittersweet fishing trip.All in all, Season 2 somehow manages to raise the lofty heights of the first run and builds confidently to the inevitable tense emotional conclusion. If you enjoy TV at it's finest, The Sopranos is simply unbeatable, and as future seasons prove it continues to get better.",5,"""It was very a good year...""",1148515200,"05 25,

To say that this show is one of the most consistently brilliant series ever is an understatement and it stands as a worthy successor to the late Homicide as the best damn show on television.  Its episodic television that plays out not like a movie but as a visualization of a great American novel and never is this more obvious than when one sits down and watches the series -- one episode after another without having to take a week-long break -- on DVD.All that said, it is also generally agreed that of the three seasons to premiere so far, the second is the weakest.  Of course, it has to be understood that when discussing a show like the Sopranos, terms like weak and strong are relative.  The weakest of the Sopranos is still stronger than anything else you're going to find.  However, it is true that the 2nd season -- especially in the first few episodes -- seems to lack the strong, central thematic focuses of the first and third.  It comes across as rather disorganized -- largely because the show's deceptively evil shadow (Livia, played brilliantly by Nancy Marchand) isn't an active character.  Whereas in the first season, she was very much an active presence (plotting the murder of her son, Tony) and her third season death hung over that season's disturbingly dark storyline like a ghost, the second season finds Livia confined to a rest home; reduced to creating random chaos with Tony's kids but no longer an active threat.  Hence, while still an excellent work of entertainment, the second season has a hard time standing on its own.  However, taken in the context of the full series, the second season instead becomes an important point of transition.  Much of what seems questionable in the 2nd season would surface later in the third and, for the most part, the pay-off made the questions all worthwhile.With all that said, the second season is teeming with classic moments and lines -- Alicia Witt's guest performance in the bittersweet episode D-Girl, Anthony Jr's discovery of existentialism at his confirmation, the intriguingly psychotic character of Furio, and, of course, the surprising but almost predestined conclusion of Pussy's storyline.  As well, this season introduces Tony's sister Janice (brillianty played by Aida Turturro who makes Janice a character you want to both strangle and embrace at the same time) and tells the story of her own fractured relationship with Richie Aprille, perhaps one of the most disturbingly evil characters to ever appear on television.  Played brilliantly by David Proval (who is nearly unrecognizable to those of us who remember him as the nicest hoodlum in the world in Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets), Richie gives the final episodes of the 2nd season a much-needed jolt and the ultimate fate of his character still comes as a nicely satisfying surprise.As for the DVD's extras, there's not quite as much as you might want but still, Sorpano fans will enjoy them.  Four of the episodes feature directors commentaries and they're a mixed batch with the most interesting coming from former actor Timothy Van Patten, who proves himself to be a witty raconteur even when he's not talking about anything in particular (as well, there's something really enjoyable about the fact that Van Patten seems to be taking as much joy in watching the episode as he is in explaining it) and the worst coming from the colorless director of From Where to Eternity (ironically, considering how unintersting the commentary is, probably the most interesting show of the season).",5,Look closer...,1009324800,"12 26, 2001",2001,3772,"['darkly', 'subversive', 'wit', 'portrait', 'suburbanites', 'trapped', 'traditions', 'preconceptions', 'own', 'recent', 'pasts', 'HBO', 'Mafia', 'series', 'Sopranos', 'be', 'everything', 'American', 'Beauty', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'more', 'say', 'show', 'one', 'most', 'consistently', 'brilliant', 'series', 'ever', 'understatement', 'worthy', 'successor', 'late', 'Homicide', 'best', 'damn', 'show', 'television', 'episodic', 'television', 'out', 'not', 'movie', 'visualization', 'great', 'American', 'novel', 'never', 'more', 'obvious', 'when', 'one', 'down', 'series', 'one', 'episode', 'having', 'take', 'week-long', 'break', 'DVD.All', 'said', 'also', 'generally', 'agreed', 'three', 'seasons', 'premiere', 'so', 'far', 'second', 'weakest', 'course', 'be', 'understood', 'when', 'discussing', 'show', 'Sopranos', 'terms', 'weak', 'strong', 'are', 'relative', 'weakest', 'Sopranos', 'still', 'stronger', 'anything', 'else', ""'re"", 'going', 'find', 'However', 'true', '2nd', 'season', 'especially', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'lack', 'strong', 'central', 'thematic', 'focuses', 'first', 'third', 'rather', 'disorganized', 'largely', 'show', 'deceptively', 'evil', 'shadow', 'Livia', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Nancy', 'Marchand', ""n't"", 'active', 'character', 'Whereas', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'active', 'presence', 'plotting', 'murder', 'son', 'Tony', 'third', 'season', 'death', 'hung', 'season', 'disturbingly', 'dark', 'storyline', 'ghost', 'second', 'season', 'Livia', 'confined', 'rest', 'home', 'reduced', 'creating', 'random', 'chaos', 'Tony', 'kids', 'no', 'longer', 'active', 'threat', 'Hence', 'still', 'excellent', 'work', 'entertainment', 'second', 'season', 'hard', 'time', 'standing', 'own', 'However', 'taken', 'context', 'full', 'series', 'second', 'season', 'instead', 'important', 'point', 'transition', 'Much', 'what', 'questionable', '2nd', 'season', 'would', 'surface', 'later', 'third', 'most', 'part', 'pay-off', 'made', 'questions', 'worthwhile.With', 'said', 'second', 'season', 'teeming', 'classic', 'moments', 'lines', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'guest', 'performance', 'bittersweet', 'episode', 'D-Girl', 'Anthony', 'Jr', 'discovery', 'existentialism', 'confirmation', 'intriguingly', 'psychotic', 'character', 'Furio', 'course', 'surprising', 'almost', 'predestined', 'conclusion', 'Pussy', 'storyline', 'well', 'season', 'Tony', 'sister', 'Janice', 'brillianty', 'played', 'Aida', 'Turturro', 'who', 'Janice', 'character', 'want', 'strangle', 'embrace', 'same', 'time', 'story', 'own', 'fractured', 'relationship', 'Richie', 'Aprille', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'disturbingly', 'evil', 'characters', 'ever', 'appear', 'television', 'Played', 'brilliantly', 'David', 'Proval', 'who', 'nearly', 'unrecognizable', 'who', 'remember', 'nicest', 'hoodlum', 'world', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'Richie', 'final', 'episodes', '2nd', 'season', 'much-needed', 'jolt', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'character', 'still', 'nicely', 'satisfying', 'surprise.As', 'DVD', 'extras', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'might', 'want', 'still', 'Sorpano', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Four', 'episodes', 'feature', 'directors', 'commentaries', ""'re"", 'mixed', 'batch', 'most', 'interesting', 'coming', 'former', 'actor', 'Timothy', 'Van', 'Patten', 'who', 'be', 'witty', 'raconteur', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'talking', 'anything', 'particular', 'well', 'something', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'fact', 'Van', 'Patten', 'be', 'taking', 'much', 'joy', 'watching', 'episode', 'explaining', 'worst', 'coming', 'colorless', 'director', 'From', 'Where', 'Eternity', 'ironically', 'considering', 'how', 'unintersting', 'commentary', 'probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'show', 'season']",N/A

Tilley Jr. ""goatman_1""","[5, 5]","Living in Japan, I don't get to watch new episodes as they air, so I have to buy the DVD's if I want to keep up, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if your willing to overlook the hefty price for an entire season.  The episodes are letter-box enhanced for 16:9 TV's and have 5.1 sound.  I don't know if this is standard in the States with the new HDTV technology, but they are very well done in terms of picture quality and sound.  there are also a handfull of episodes that include directors commentary.  Not very common for a TV series.The episodes ranged from tragic to hysterical and only get better as they go.  While the first season focused more on Tony and his mom, the second season spreads it roots a bit and introduces a lot of new characters like Tony's sister Janice and her psycho boyfriend and Tony's semi-nemesis Richie.  The Janice/ Richie subplot was definitely one of my favorites of the series.  The last two episodes of the season were executed perfectly.  No let-down's.To me, the strength of the series is the believability and likeability of all the characters. Livia is... was highly dysfunctional, but god she's funny to watch.  I wish she had been as prominant a character in the second season as in the first, but given Nancy Marchand's health problems it must have been necessary to diminish her part.  I haven't seen any episodes from the third season but she'll be sorely missed.For the most part I think TV is mindless drivel.  There are a few rays of hope here and there, but they're squeezed in between mindless, smarmy, reality-based stranded Island shows that make me want to yak.  Thank God HBO had the cojones to make a show like this one.  While the networks were scrambling to find the next &quot;Survivor&quot; HBO continued to produce good shows with quality direction, telling great stories with talented actors.  The Sopranos is more than a mere TV show.  It's a piece of U.S. mythology.  It holds it's own with any of the gangster films of my lifetime with the exception of Godfather 1 &amp; 2 (I think Tony would agree).",5,All TV should be this good.,1005868800,"11 16, 2001",2001,2067,"['Living', 'Japan', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'new', 'episodes', 'air', 'so', 'have', 'buy', 'DVD', 'want', 'keep', 'up', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'willing', 'overlook', 'hefty', 'price', 'entire', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'letter-box', 'enhanced', '16:9', 'TV', 'have', '5.1', 'sound', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'standard', 'States', 'new', 'HDTV', 'technology', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'terms', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'also', 'handfull', 'episodes', 'include', 'directors', 'commentary', 'Not', 'very', 'common', 'TV', 'series.The', 'episodes', 'ranged', 'tragic', 'hysterical', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'go', 'first', 'season', 'focused', 'more', 'Tony', 'mom', 'second', 'season', 'bit', 'lot', 'new', 'characters', 'Tony', 'sister', 'Janice', 'psycho', 'boyfriend', 'Tony', 'semi-nemesis', 'Richie', 'Janice/', 'Richie', 'subplot', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'favorites', 'series', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'executed', 'perfectly', ""let-down's.To"", 'strength', 'series', 'believability', 'likeability', 'characters', 'Livia', 'was', 'highly', 'dysfunctional', 'funny', 'watch', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'prominant', 'character', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'given', 'Nancy', 'Marchand', 'health', 'problems', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'diminish', 'part', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sorely', 'missed.For', 'most', 'part', 'think', 'TV', 'mindless', 'drivel', 'are', 'few', 'rays', 'hope', 'here', 'there', ""'re"", 'squeezed', 'mindless', 'smarmy', 'reality-based', 'stranded', 'Island', 'shows', 'make', 'want', 'yak', 'Thank', 'God', 'HBO', 'had', 'cojones', 'make', 'show', 'one', 'networks', 'were', 'scrambling', 'find', 'next', 'quot', 'Survivor', 'quot', 'HBO', 'continued', 'produce', 'good', 'shows', 'quality', 'direction', 'telling', 'great', 'stories', 'talented', 'actors', 'Sopranos', 'more', 'mere', 'TV', 'show', 'piece', 'U.S.', 'mythology', 'own', 'gangster', 'films', 'lifetime', 'exception', 'Godfather', '1', 'amp', '2', 'think', 'Tony', 'would', 'agree']",N/A

All the regular cast members returned for the second season (James Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Lorraine Bracco, etc.), as well as a few new additions. Season two introduced Tony Soprano's sister Janice (played by Aida Turturro), and Richie Aprile (played by David Proval), the younger brother of late mob boss Jackie Aprile (who died of cancer in season one). Plus, Drea de Matteo became a regular on the show as Christopher's girlfriend Adriana (after appearing as an occasional guest star during season one). Season two of ""The Sopranos"" features many of the same elements as season one: shocking graphic violence, strong sexuality/nudity, and hard R-rated foul language. But like season one also has great acting, writing, and directing in just about every episode. James Gandolfini won the Emmy for Best Actor in a Drama Series for season two, and deservedly so. Unfortunately, season two would be the last for Nancy Marchand, who brilliantly portrayed Tony's mother Livia. Marchand lost her battle with lung cancer just a few months after the final episode of season two aired on HBO. Apparently Marchand's health started to decline during the filming of the second season, because she doesn't appear on screen as much during season two as she did in season one. Nevertheless, Marchand (as ill as she was) did some great acting on ""The Sopranos"", and won a Golden Globe and two Emmy nominations for her work.

669554,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005NOHO,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 3]","Having recently gotten into ""The Sopranos,"" after I finished watching the first season; I rushed to get this. Let me just say, I loved the first season; But I love this more. This is a great season of a great show. Not only are the jokes funnier, the acting stronger, the plot twists more surprising, but they also made a couple good decisions. First off, Livia Soprano (Tony's mom) was a big part of the first season (and frankly, she wore out her welcome several times). Here, her character is decreased and when she does appear...It's not bad. Anyway...Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) and his family, including wife Carmela (Edie Falco), daughter Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and son A.J. return with a whole array of family and business issues. Tony is still seeing Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), his shrink. Christopher (Michael Imperioli) tries acting. Adreanna's (Drea De Matteo) uncle Richie shows up in the beginning of the season, becoming a main character and ends up dating Tony's sister Janice; Despite a personal-and-business feud between them. Oh, and there's a rat in the family. I don't want to say too much, because I think with any show, it's better to watch each episode without any real knowledge of what's going to happen. But, rest assured, if you like the 1st season. You'll definitely like this one. Here's the list of episodes and a few comments:1. Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist's Office-The first episode of the 2nd season picks up basically where the first one left off. Tony's uncle Junior is in jail, which makes Tony new boss, he's severed ties with his mother, and his psychiatrist won't see him. In this episode his sister Janice shows up.2. Do Not Resuscitate-Nothing really significant occurs in this episode, but it is pretty entertaining. It's not the best, but it's not the worst.3. Toodle F**king Oo-This episode is pretty funny, except my interest in Tony's mother in the hospital goes down everytime there's a scene that takes place there.4. Commendator-In this episode, Tony goes to Italy without Carmela or the kids for business purposes and Pussy's wife wants to divorce him. The episode is written by series creator, David Chase...So, it's one of the better episodes even though it's different from the other ones.5. Big Girls Don't Cry-This is the most entertaining and cool episode so far and features Christopher joining an acting class and letting out some of his inner demons as well as Tony returning to therapy.6. The Happy Wanderer-This episode has an array of cool things. Guest appearances by Frank Sinatra Jr. and Robert Patrick; And you hear the song ""Down"" by Stone Temple Pilots played in the background in one scene. The season is getting a lot better later on, because this is a really great episode.7. D Girl-This episode is extremely close to perfect. Guest appearances by Jon Favreau, Janeane Garofalo, and Sandra Bernhard.8. Full Leather Jacket-A surprising (and funny...kinda) ending makes this episode one of the best this season.9. From Where to Eternity-This episode is written by Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, and deals with what happened in the previous episode. Very dramatic, very funny, and very entertaining. The classic R&B; score works really well.10. Bust Out-In this episode, Carmela comes close to having an affair with a painter. It's an entertaining episode.11. House Arrest-This episode is very funny and you also get to see a sensitive side to Uncle Junior.12. The Knight in White Satin Armor-This episode wasn't my favorite, but the last 20 minutes were great. One of the main characters may or may not die in this episode.13.

669555,A2BFVDQTU9Z1L2,B00005NOHO,"J ""peacemover""","[16, 20]","David Chase's series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; is a fascinating portrayal of the complex allegiances and contrasting values of a mobster struggling to cope with the challenges of his two families- his biological family, and his crime family.The series is powerfully entertaining, and also explores the dark side of the human psyche as seen through the eyes of Tony Soprano and the other richly developed characters in the show.The second season, in my opinion is clearly the best one thus far because of the new developments in the storyline and all the tensions coming to the forefront.  This is particularly true of Tony's conflictual relationship with his mother, his struggle to keep Uncle Junior under his thumb (while maintaining his &quot;stripes&quot; as the de facto boss); in addition to new challenges with his biological family.Also, these 13 episodes are well-written, acted and skillfully directed.  The sessions with Dr. Melfi (his psychiatrist) are seamlessly woven into the other plot developments, as well as the rich dream and fantasy sequences that delve into Tony's thought process, as well as his anxieties, both conscious and unconscious.  David Chase has put together a real gem.  If you can't catch the re-broadcast on HBO on Sundays at 8, or you just want the high quality of DVD, pick this one up.

669562,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B00005NOHO,Kevin J. Loria,"[1, 1]","The 2nd season of the ground breaking crime drama. An Anti-hero lead series may not seem ground-breaking in the wake of series like Breaking Bad, Dexter and even Mad Men & Hannibal's leads, but over a decade ago in 1999 the Sopranos introduced us to a flawed ensemble of recurring New Jersey Mob characters. The original HBO series was ultimately Goodfellas set in &#34;the present day&#34; and earned over 20 Emmys over its 6 season run. The most brilliant twist on the premise was having jersey mob boss Tony Soprano (the Late great James Gandolfini) continues the therapy began in the pilot episode  to get to the bottom of his anxiety attacks and the add stress of him assuming control of Jersey.  His therapy sessions give the viewer a unique window into the character's thoughts that would not be possible outside of a stage monologue.  In a great bit of casting an equally interesting character provides this therapy Goodfellas' Karen Hill herself Lorraine Bracco plays Dr Melif. Bracco isn't the only Goodfellas vet of the Sopranos regular cast, Michael Imperioli, Tony Sirico, Vincent Pastore, Frank Vincent, and Joseph R. Gannascoli are all in the Scorsese mob classic. In turn Scorsese himself turns up as himself for a second in the Sopranos pilot. Don't let the series pedigree convince you, this is must watch wise guy dramaSeason two is sadly the last season (and screen appearance) with the late Susan Marchand as the manipulative Livia Soprano. It also introduces recurring characters Janice, Tony's flaky long-lost sister and Big P returns with an explanation of his season 1 disappearance but may have been turned. Uncle Junior gets out of prison due to health concerns, also out of Prison and reasserting his street cred the unstable Richie Aprile Tony, Paulie and Chris make business trip to Naples and my favorite Italian mob import character Furio is introduced. Chris struggles with his Hollywood inspirations and Jon Favreau turns up to consult. Later Chris ends up in a coma after a failed hit. Season two's closer ep &#34;Funhouse&#34; is a amazingly surreal food poisoning dream ending with some clarity for Tony as to his federal mole issues.",5,"""Those who 'want' respect, 'give' respect.""",1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,2171,"['2nd', 'season', 'ground', 'breaking', 'crime', 'drama', 'Anti-hero', 'lead', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'ground-breaking', 'wake', 'series', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Dexter', 'even', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Hannibal', 'leads', 'decade', 'ago', '1999', 'Sopranos', 'introduced', 'flawed', 'ensemble', 'recurring', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Mob', 'characters', 'original', 'HBO', 'series', 'was', 'ultimately', 'Goodfellas', 'set', '34', 'present', 'day', '34', 'earned', '20', 'Emmys', '6', 'season', 'run', 'most', 'brilliant', 'twist', 'premise', 'was', 'having', 'jersey', 'mob', 'boss', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'Late', 'great', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'therapy', 'began', 'pilot', 'episode', 'get', 'bottom', 'anxiety', 'attacks', 'add', 'stress', 'assuming', 'control', 'Jersey', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'give', 'viewer', 'unique', 'window', 'character', 'thoughts', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'stage', 'monologue', 'great', 'bit', 'casting', 'equally', 'interesting', 'character', 'therapy', 'Goodfellas', 'Karen', 'Hill', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'Dr', 'Melif', 'Bracco', ""n't"", 'only', 'Goodfellas', 'vet', 'Sopranos', 'regular', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'Tony', 'Sirico', 'Vincent', 'Pastore', 'Frank', 'Vincent', 'Joseph', 'R.', 'Gannascoli', 'are', 'Scorsese', 'mob', 'classic', 'turn', 'Scorsese', 'up', 'second', 'Sopranos', 'pilot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'series', 'pedigree', 'convince', 'must', 'watch', 'wise', 'guy', 'dramaSeason', 'two', 'sadly', 'last', 'season', 'screen', 'appearance', 'late', 'Susan', 'Marchand', 'manipulative', 'Livia', 'Soprano', 'also', 'recurring', 'characters', 'Janice', 'Tony', 'flaky', 'long-lost', 'sister', 'Big', 'P', 'explanation', 'season', '1', 'disappearance', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'Uncle', 'Junior', 'prison', 'due', 'health', 'concerns', 'also', 'Prison', 'reasserting', 'street', 'cred', 'unstable', 'Richie', 'Aprile', 'Tony', 'Paulie', 'Chris', 'make', 'business', 'trip', 'Naples', 'favorite', 'Italian', 'mob', 'import', 'character', 'Furio', 'introduced', 'Chris', 'Hollywood', 'inspirations', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'up', 'consult', 'Later', 'Chris', 'up', 'coma', 'failed', 'hit', 'Season', 'two', 'closer', 'ep', '34', 'Funhouse', '34', 'amazingly', 'surreal', 'food', 'poisoning', 'dream', 'ending', 'clarity', 'Tony', 'federal', 'mole', 'issues']",N/A

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[0, 0]","As compelling, unpredictable, intense, intriguing and entertaining as the first season was, this second season is all of that and even more.  In every conceivable way, ""The Sopranos"" is entertaining, from the masterful subtleties to the down right provocative scenery and dialogue.  From the explosive first episode to the revealing and poignant last episode, the writers, actors and directors all deserve high praise for bringing this season to fruition.  There has never been and probably will never be another show like this one.James Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Lorraine Bracco and all of the other outstanding actors for this series bring such a liveliness and depth of character to each character that each and every one of them deserves all of the accolades they've received and will continue to receive for their performances in this pivotal series.Series creator David Chase can only be described a pure genius for ""The Sopranos!""  No other movie or series has ever taken a look at the mob life such as this one and it works brilliantly from episode to episode, there's never a dull moment.  I truly enjoy how they work in clues in one episode that may payoff in that episode or it may take several episodes before it pays off, it's just brilliant.  ""The Sopranos"" is truly episodic drama at its finest!Even though I do find that the pricing for the boxed DVD set is a bit high considering that there are only thirteen episodes per season, it is worth every penny as it will give you an opportunity to get caught up on the entire season.  Due to job responsibilities at the time, I didn't get caught on to this show until recently and I can only imagine the wait between episodes and seasons on HBO, as I will soon be discovering as the fifth season rolls in here in a few months.Episodes:Guy Walks Into a Psychiatrist's Office... - Junior's in jail following a Federal indictment; Big ""P"" makes a surprise return; Dr. Melfi has given up on Tony in fear for her life; Tony is now no longer the de-facto boss, he is the boss; Tony's completely given up on his mother and his sister Janice makes a return from Seattle to ""help"" Livia.Don Not Resuscitate - Tony has taken over almost all of Junior's business but leaves him five percent to continue earning and Janice falls into Livia's web of deceit and self pity.Toodle-F'ing-Doo - Interesting title for an episode that can certainly not be named here.

Dr. Melfi finds herself completely mortified after a chance run in with Tony and Richie Aprile gets out of prison after ten years and starts making things complicated for Tony.

669566,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B00005NOHO,L.A. Scene,"[6, 7]","There aren't many television shows in the 50+ years of television history that can be categorized as a ""weekly event"".  A ""weekly event"" show basically has everyone talking about the episode the next day.  In the 1980s, shows such as ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" were ""weekly events"".  In the 1990s, ""Seinfeld"" would take emerge as the show that would become a ""weekly event"".  As Seinfeld wound up, another show would soon take that title into the 21st century - that show being HBO's ""The Sopranos"".  ""The Sopranos"" would be different in that it was a show that appeared on a premium (pay) cable station and would prove that premium cable stations can produce high quality shows that provide high levels of enjoyment.  I'm not someone who subscribes to HBO so I felt on the ""outside"" on the ""talk"" would surround the episodes of ""The Sopranos"".  However that didn't stop my curiosity about wanting to watch the show.  Once I watched ""The Sopranos - The Complete First Season"", I not only got an appreciation for the show - but I now understood where all of the hype came from on this show.  I was pleased when for the most part, ""The Sopranos - The Complete Second Season"" basically picked up with Season 1 left off.The show focuses on an organized Italian-American crime family that is based in North Jersey.  The main character of the show is Tony Soprano played brilliantly by James Gandolfini.  Tony is the head of the fictional DiMeo crime family.  On the show, we see Tony try to balance his ""work"" in the DiMeo crime family with his home life.  Tony also suffers from panic attacks and depression and therefore sees a psychiatrist - Dr. Jennifer Melfi (played by Lorraine Bracco).Here are some of the key storylines from Season 2:1-Tony is now the head of the DiMeo crime family.  We see the pressures of this responsibility begin to eat at Tony, raising signs of aggression and depression.  This makes a strong testament to how great an actor James Gandolfini is.2- We are introduced to two new characters, Tony's sister Janice (played by Aida Turturro) and Richie Aprile (played by David Proval), the brother of former DiMeo Crime Boss Jackie Aprile.  Throughout the season, we see both Janice and Richie become involved with each other.  Both will drive Tony crazy throughout the year.3-Sal Bonponsiero (played by Vincent Pastore) is working for the FBI and his job is to get information on Tony in order to help the Feds proceed with an indictment.  This is a very good storyline that will last throughout the entire season.4-Dr. Jennifer Melfi begins to battle alcoholism as well as feelings for caring for Tony.  This storyline continues to drag from Season 1.  The alcoholism and Melfi's visits to her own psychiatrist do give more insight to her character than in Season 1, but overall I found this storyline not very interesting.5-Christopher Moltisanti's (played by Michael Imperioli) continues to explore his dream of becoming a writer while at the same time trying to become a ""Made Man"".  There are only about three episodes that really highlight Christopher's character - I would have liked to have seen more.6-David Scatino (played by Robert Patrick), an old friend of Tony's becomes indebted to Tony and Richie following some gambling debts he accrued in a high stakes poker game.  David's life slowly unravels as he deals with the financial stress he is under.  This was a good storyline.7-Uncle Junior (played by Dominic Chianese) is under house arrest as he awaits his day in court to battle the Federal Charges he is facing.  At the same time, he is battling health problems.  There is really only one episode that showcases Uncle Junior and during the rest of the year he is more of a supporting character.8-Tony is still at war with his mother Livia (played by Nancy Marchand) over her attempt on Tony's life.  At the same time Livia is battling her own set of health problems.  Livia's role is not as prominent as in Season 1.9-Meadow Soprano is trying to decide on a College to attend as her graduation is pending.10-Anthony Soprano Jr. (played by Robert Iler) continues to try find himself as he begins to enter his teenage years.  The episode surrounding his confirmation is one of his best.11-Carmela Soprano (played by Edie Falco) begins to face the problems of her marriage and family - including Tony's infidelity  as she begins to be attracted to another man.Here are some other points to consider from Season 2:- Overall, I thought the season started slow, but gained momentum by mid-season.  By season's end, the show reaches heights beyond Season 1- including two terrific episodes to close the season.- I was disappointed that Silvio ""Sil"" Dante is not a prominent  character during Season 2.  This is probably because he was touring with Bruce Springsteen during filming of this season.- There is one episode where Tony goes to Italy with Paulie Walnuts and Christopher Moltisanti.  The episode was filmed in Naples.  Paulie's visit to the ""mother land"" provides some great comical moments, but more could have been done with Christopher's visit.- Paulie Walnuts continues to be one of the better characters.  His visit to a psychic is classic.- The episode ""From Where to Eternity"" features a terrific scene between Tony and Melfi where Tony explains to Melfi why he is a soldier and does what he does - great stuff.I called Season 1 to be ""the most exciting 60 minutes on television"".  Despite the slow start, I still feel Season 2 continues to back this claim I make. As for the DVD packaging - besides the usual extras, one thing I really liked was how there was a brief textual synopsis provided on the screen before playing the episode.  Overall, this is a very good and entertaining set - highly recommended.",5,"Continuing to be a great ""television event""",1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,5754,"['are', ""n't"", 'many', 'television',

669567,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005NOHO,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 4]","I was not completely bowled over by the first season of ""The Sopranos"" the way I was about the first season of HBO's ""Six Feet Under,"" but I think that was mainly because no show in the history of television could possibly fulfill the expectations I had when I started watching.  The important thing is that however highly you graded that first season that the second season of the show is even better.  I think there are several reasons for this:First, Carmela Soprano (Edie Falco) is given ample opportunity to show some teeth in these episodes.  My oldest daughter is currently caught up in the college application rat race so I totally appreciated Carmela going to the mattresses for Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler).  By the same token I thought it was a good move to make the Soprano kids more background figures in the second season.Second, David Chase and the writers wisely backed off forcing the whole bit with Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) seeing his shrink Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco).  I bet on balance Melfi spent more time seeing her own shrink (Peter Bogdanovich) than she did Tony during season two.  This had the great effect of recalibrating their relationship because now she is having about as many problems as he does.  Consequently, it was not just more of the same and by the end of the season Tony's problems have been clearly defined, giving them something to work on in season three.Third, rather than continue the attempt by Uncle Junior (Dominic Chianese) and Livia (Nancy Marchand) to take out Tony the threat comes from a pair of new characters, Richie April (David Proval), recently released from a 10-year prison stint, and Tony's sister Janice (Aida Turturro).  Actually, I think that it is wickedly funny that Livia is reduced to weeping harridan for most of these episodes.  Besides, I still get the feeling Uncle Junior is merely biding his time and the season works a lot better for me dealing with more of the weekly routine of being mobsters than the high opera of a coup attempt.  But this works well for the show because it did not pick up right where it left off; even the question of whether ""Sal"" (Vincent Pastore) is a rat gets put on the backburner for a while before coming back with a vengeance.Finally, in the second season the right people get killed.  Sure, a lot of people get killed, but I mean that there were two particular people I wanted to see dead in this cast and both of them got whacked on Disc 4.  Along with Meadow graduating high school there was not much else I wanted to really see happen by the end of the second season.  Now, on to season three.",5,Tony and Carmela try to get Meadow into the right college,1046908800,"03 6, 2003",2003,2611,"['was', 'not', 'completely', 'bowled', 'over', 'first', 'season', 'Sopranos', 'way', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'HBO', 'Six', 'Feet', 'think', 'was', 'mainly', 'show', 'history', 'television', 'could', 'possibly', 'fulfill', 'expectations', 'had', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'important', 'thing', 'however', 'highly', 'graded', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'even', 'better', 'think', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'First', 'Carmela', 'Soprano', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'given', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'show', 'teeth', 'episodes', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'currently', 'caught', 'up', 'college', 'application', 'rat', 'race', 'totally', 'appreciated', 'Carmela', 'going', 'mattresses', 'Meadow', 'Jamie-Lynn', 'Sigler', 'same', 'token', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'make', 'Soprano', 'kids', 'more', 'background', 'figures', 'second', 'season.Second', 'David', 'Chase', 'writers', 'wisely', 'backed', 'off', 'forcing', 'whole', 'bit', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'seeing', 'shrink', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'bet', 'balance', 'Melfi', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'seeing', 'own', 'shrink', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'did', 'Tony', 'season', 'two', 'had', 'great', 'effect', 'recalibrating', 'relationship', 'now', 'having', 'about', 'many', 'problems', 'Consequently', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'more', 'same', 'end', 'season', 'Tony', 'problems', 'have', 'been', 'clearly', 'defined', 'giving', 'something', 'work', 'season', 'three.Third', 'rather', 'continue', 'attempt', 'Uncle', 'Junior', 'Dominic', 'Chianese', 'Livia', 'Nancy', 'Marchand', 'take', 'out', 'Tony', 'threat', 'pair', 'new', 'characters', 'Richie', 'April', 'David', 'Proval', 'recently', 'released', '10-year', 'prison', 'stint', 'Tony', 'sister', 'Janice', 'Aida', 'Turturro', 'Actually', 'think', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'Livia', 'reduced', 'weeping', 'harridan', 'most', 'episodes', 'still', 'get', 'feeling', 'Uncle', 'Junior', 'merely', 'biding', 'time', 'season', 'lot', 'better', 'dealing', 'more', 'weekly', 'routine', 'being', 'mobsters', 'high', 'opera', 'coup', 'attempt', 'well', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'even', 'question', 'Sal', 'Vincent', 'Pastore', 'rat', 'put', 'backburner', 'while', 'coming', 'back', 'vengeance.Finally', 'second', 'season', 'right', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'Sure', 'lot', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'mean', 'were', 'two', 'particular', 'people', 'wanted', 'see', 'dead', 'cast', 'got', 'whacked', 'Disc', '4', 'Meadow', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'wanted', 'really', 'see', 'happen', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'Now', 'season', 'three']",N/A

All I can tell you is that the second season is as good, if not better, than the first.There are some major plot developments. Livia (Nancy Marchand)and Tony's Uncle Junior (Dominic Chianese) hatch a plan that can have murderous consequences for Tony (James Gandolfini). Carmela (Edie Falco) is doing all in her power, and I mean all, to help their daughter, Meadow (Jamie Lynn Sigler), get into a good college. In her own sweet way, Carmela can be just as scary as Tony. Janice (Aida Turturro), Tony's sister, comes back home, wreaks havoc, marries the former mob boss's jailbird brother, and then leaves town with a bang. One of Tony's best friends becomes a snitch for the Feds. No wonder Tony continues to have anxiety attacks and still needs to see his psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco).The writing continues to be intelligent, and the story lines are as well thought out and engrossing as ever. I have watched the entire first, second, and third seasons and am eagerly awaiting the fourth season. I absolutely love this series!The four disc DVD set is well packaged, and the video and audio are crystal clear.

From the very beginning, it takes off where the first season lets off and runs with the plot, deepening my understanding of the main characters, and adding a few new ones, such as Tony's sister, who at first seems like a New Age flake and then grows in complexity to have a major role in the plot.Each of the characters face challenges, and how they deal with them are natural expressions of their personalities. Carmela's attraction to another man is an example of this. So are the delusions of grandeur of two of Christopher's sidekicks that eventually leads to violence.  This keeps the story real and the people understandable, if not always sympathetic.  Another new character, Ritchie, comes across as a cruel and sadistic bad guy.  The fact that he's romancing Tony's sister complicates matters.  Family is important too as Tony's mother is still on the scene.  And his relationship with his wife and children are very real as well as complex.  Even Tony's therapist starts showing cracks in her personality.  And in a very fine acting job, one of the men Tony trusts becomes an informer.The writing and cinematography are wonderful and the tension never lets up, resulting in a violent surprise in the next-to-last episode.  It's all so good that I have to forgive the times when a few words of dialog were indistinct or the author resorts to dream and fantasy sequences to move the plot along.  I couldn't stop watching it however, and think that DVDs are the best way to watch the series.  This way, I don't have to wait a whole week to see the next episode.  All I have to do is stay up late.I recommend this second year series completely.  It had a rough act to follow after the success of the first year.

669576,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005NOHO,Michael Crane,"[49, 51]","The Sopranos is one of HBO's greatest achievements (although I admit that I think it lost some of its momentum and spark with seasons three and four).  When I first saw the show, I was hooked.  I'd watch anywhere from three to four episodes a day.  One of the great things about first watching this show on DVD was that I could watch any number of episodes instead of just watching one per week.&quot;The Sopranos: The Complete Second Season&quot; has to be my favorite season.  As much as I love the first one, this was when things were really funny, intense, dramatic and involving.  The season doesn't let us down when it comes to Tony having more problems than ever before.  Both in his Mafia Family and his immediate family, Tony can never get a break.  His wife gives him grief while his kids keep doing things that upset him.  And don't get me started on his ill mother and self-centered sister.  Life isn't much better in his Mafia Family when the brother of Jackie is released from prison and is giving Tony a hard time both personally and professionally.  Not to mention that his long time friend, Big P. comes back from a long hiatus when he was first suspected of turning rat to the Feds.  All of this leads to one incredible and unpredictable season that showcases the show like none other.For me, this was the most entertaining season of them all.  I loved the characters, the constantly changing storylines, and the personal and business life of Tony Soprano, which is superbly balanced in this season.  There's still the much appreciated humor in these episodes that were found lacking in the next two seasons.  It doesn't feel like a soap opera, but a more enhanced look into the Mafia world.  There's plenty of action as well as dramatic storylines that will make everybody happy for the most part.This season comes in a set of four discs, totaling at 13 episodes.  The great thing about the show is that it is presented to us in a widescreen format that is enhanced for widescreen TVs.  This really makes the show that more effective because you feel like you're actually watching a movie rather than a show on cable.  The picture and sound quality is great and really shows.  There are some nice little extras, such as featurettes, brief previews and recaps of episodes, web-links and more.&quot;The Sopranos: The Complete Second Season&quot; is a bundle of laughs, suspense, drama, action and surprises.  You're always on your toes and you never know what's coming next.  One thing's for sure; this is the most unpredictable season out of the four seasons (the fifth one looks pretty promising thus far).  While you'll want to start with the first season if you've never seen the show before, you'll know that you will have something special to look forward to once you get to the second season.  In my opinion, this is where Sopranos is flawlessly at its best. -Michael Crane",5,It's a Family Thing....,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,2897,"['Sopranos', 'one', 'HBO', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'admit', 'think', 'lost', 'momentum', 'spark', 'seasons', 'three', 'four', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'show', 'was', 'hooked', ""'d"", 'watch', 'anywhere', 'three', 'four', 'episodes', 'day', 'One', 'great', 'things', 'first', 'watching', 'show', 'DVD', 'was', 'could', 'watch', 'number', 'episodes', 'instead', 'just', 'watching', 'one', 'week.', 'quot', 'Sopranos', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'quot', 'be', 'favorite', 'season', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'really', 'funny', 'intense', 'dramatic', 'involving', 'season', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'when', 'Tony', 'having', 'more', 'problems', 'ever', 'Mafia', 'Family', 'immediate', 'family', 'Tony', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'break', 'wife', 'grief', 'kids', 'keep', 'doing', 'things', 'upset', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'ill', 'mother', 'self-centered', 'sister', 'Life', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'Mafia', 'Family', 'when', 'brother', 'Jackie', 'released', 'prison', 'giving', 'Tony', 'hard', 'time', 'personally', 'professionally', 'Not', 'mention', 'long', 'time', 'friend', 'Big', 'P.', 'back', 'long', 'hiatus', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'suspected', 'turning', 'rat', 'Feds', 'one', 'incredible', 'unpredictable', 'season', 'show', 'none', 'was', 'most', 'entertaining', 'season', 'loved', 'characters', 'constantly', 'changing', 'storylines', 'personal', 'business', 'life', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'superbly', 'balanced', 'season', 'still', 'much', 'appreciated', 'humor', 'episodes', 'were', 'found', 'lacking', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', ""n't"", 'feel', 'soap', 'opera', 'more', 'enhanced', 'look', 'Mafia', 'world', 'plenty', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'dramatic', 'storylines', 'will', 'make', 'everybody', 'happy', 'most', 'part.This', 'season', 'set', 'four', 'discs', 'totaling', '13', 'episodes', 'great', 'thing', 'show', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'format', 'enhanced', 'widescreen', 'TVs', 'really', 'show', 'more', 'effective', 'feel', ""'re"", 'actually', 'watching', 'movie', 'rather', 'show', 'cable', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'great', 'really', 'shows', 'are', 'nice', 'little', 'extras', 'such', 'featurettes', 'brief', 'previews', 'recaps', 'episodes', 'web-links', 'more.', 'quot', 'Sopranos', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'quot', 'bundle', 'laughs', 'suspense', 'drama', 'action', 'surprises', ""'re"", 'always', 'toes', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'most', 'unpredictable', 'season', 'four', 'seasons', 'fifth', 'one', 'pretty', 'promising', 'thus', 'far', ""'ll"", 'want', 'start', 'first', 'season', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', ""'ll"", 'know', 'will', 'have', 'something', 'special', 'look', 'forward', 'once', 'get', 'second', 'season', 'opinion', 'where', 'Sopranos', 'flawlessly', 'best', '-Michael', 'Crane']",N/A

Because now that we know all the characters (well, most of them anyway), we get the priviledge of watching them morph into some the most wonderfully twisted creations in small-screen history.Of course, everything revolves around Tony and how he deals with these various psychopaths who seem hell-bent on destroying his life. In the second season, Tony comes to terms (or attempts to anyway..) with his wicked mother (the late-great Nancy Marchand) and his insipid Uncle Junior who, in the first season, attempted to have him whacked. Meanwhile, Tony becomes increasingly suspicious of his dear friend Big Pussy Bompensero. Tony fears Pussy will rat him out and battles his worst inner-demons while trying to work out a viable solution. The second season also introduces two of the Sopranos' most whacked-out characters: Tony's coniving hippie sister Janice and the fresh-outta-prison Richie Aprile. Together, these two proceed to wreak untold havoc on Tony's life. And hey, if that's not enough, Tony's troublemaking kids, A.J. and Meadow, give him no peace at home while wife Carmella grows increasingly impatient with his loveless ways. All told, the rampant lunacy is enough to send even the most level-headed among us straight to the comfy confines of Dr. Melfi's couch!Overall, the second season plays like a series of short films. However, unlike the inconsistent 3rd season, the flow is continuous and very few issues go unresolved. The Sopranos offers some of the finest writing and acting on TV (or film for that matter). The sense of drama and character development are second to none. Everything about the show is first-rate and in the marvelous second season everything gels to perfection.

669591,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00005NOHO,P Magnum,"[6, 7]","The Sopranos' first season was an instant sensation.  Hailed by many critics as one of the best shows ever created, the second season was highly anticipated.  Instead of succumbing to the dreaded sophomore jinx, series creator David Chase mixed things up by introducing new characters while wisely keeping a strong spotlight on the amazing James Gandolfini.  Mr. Gandolfini strikes a commanding presence as mob boss Tony Soprano.  He is asked to carry a heavy load by being the center of a complex and intricate show and he gives a brilliant, multi-layered performance.  Michael Imperioli has an even greater role as young mobster Christopher Moltisanti.  His work in the episodes where he is shot and almost dies are outstanding.  Tony Sirico again provides strong work and comic relief as Paulie Walnuts and Vincent Pastore is great as the paranoid and ill-fated Big Pussy Bompansiero. Aida Turturro is introduced as Tony's seemingly spacey, but calculating and scheming sister Janice and David Proval as the menacing Richie Aprille, younger brother to the late Jackie Aprille and who has spent the last ten years in jail.  He's back and he becomes a thorn in Tony's side.  Edie Falco is excellent as Tony's beleaguered wife Carmella, but the one sour note to season is Lorraine Bracco's Dr. Melfi.  She is conflicted about treating Tony and the continuing storyline about her ex-husband's disapproval of the situation and the image of Italian-Americans seems forced.  That is the one lowlight as season two lives up to the hype.  The Sopranos is more like a mini-movie each week, rather than a television show and the DVD format only enhances the viewing experience.  This set is a must have.",5,Stellar Second Season,1004918400,"11 5, 2001",2001,1695,"['Sopranos', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'instant', 'sensation', 'Hailed', 'many', 'critics', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'created', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'Instead', 'succumbing', 'dreaded', 'sophomore', 'jinx', 'series', 'creator', 'David', 'Chase', 'mixed', 'things', 'up', 'introducing', 'new', 'characters', 'wisely', 'keeping', 'strong', 'spotlight', 'amazing', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Mr.', 'Gandolfini', 'commanding', 'presence', 'mob', 'boss', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'asked', 'carry', 'heavy', 'load', 'being', 'center', 'complex', 'intricate', 'show', 'brilliant', 'multi-layered', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Imperioli', 'even', 'greater', 'role', 'young', 'mobster', 'Christopher', 'Moltisanti', 'work', 'episodes', 'where', 'shot', 'almost', 'dies', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Tony', 'Sirico', 'again', 'strong', 'work', 'comic', 'relief', 'Paulie', 'Walnuts', 'Vincent', 'Pastore', 'great', 'paranoid', 'ill-fated', 'Big', 'Pussy', 'Bompansiero', 'Aida', 'Turturro', 'introduced', 'Tony', 'seemingly', 'spacey', 'calculating', 'scheming', 'sister', 'Janice', 'David', 'Proval', 'menacing', 'Richie', 'Aprille', 'younger', 'brother', 'late', 'Jackie', 'Aprille', 'who', 'spent', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'jail', 'back', 'thorn', 'Tony', 'side', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'excellent', 'Tony', 'beleaguered', 'wife', 'Carmella', 'one', 'sour', 'note', 'season', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', 'conflicted', 'treating', 'Tony', 'continuing', 'storyline', 'ex-husband', 'disapproval', 'situation', 'image', 'Italian-Americans', 'forced', 'one', 'lowlight', 'season', 'two', 'hype', 'Sopranos', 'more', 'mini-movie', 'week', 'rather', 'television', 'show', 'DVD', 'only', 'viewing', 'experience', 'set', 'must', 'have']",N/A

Monsoon,"[1, 1]","Since the quality of the show has been talked about at great length, for this review, I'm just going to focus on the technical aspects of the DVD's.VIDEO:Wow. The video quality is flat out excellent. Presented in anamorphic widescreen, colors are vivid, detail level is high and besides an expected amount of grain, the picture is crystal clean. Unlike the DVD's of the first season, aliasing is kept to a minimum. The only bad news about the transfer is that there is a noticeable amount of over edge-enhancement and blacks are some times a little off. Overall though, the video quality surpasses most current DVD releases of major motion pictures.AUDIO:Again excellent. While the Dolby 5.1 track won't compare with one of a big budget action movie, the dialogue comes in perfectly. Since the show is dialogue driven, this is obviously quite important. Despite the heavy use of background music and scenes taking place in large public places, dialogue is never drowned out.EXTRASEach episode contains a clips of ""previously on"" and ""next on"" as well as a brief plot summary. There are also 4 commentary tracks. They provide some interesting insight into the making of the episodes but besides that, aren't all that special (still better then nothing).

669597,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00005NOHO,Robert I. Hedges,"[0, 0]","""The Sopranos"" is one of the most innovative, creative, and psychologically intense television shows ever made. The focus in season two is on the increasingly divergent personalities of Tony and his relationships with his family and his associates. In the beginning of the series, Tony is at a relative high water mark, but as the season progresses new and different challenges expose themselves every week. Tony's indiscretions take an ever-increasing toll on his relationship with his wife (and ultimately his whole family), while his hippy sister, Janice, shows up without warning to complete the familial emotional torment that his mother began. Unfortunately the ultra-violent and ambitious Richie Aprile is released from prison and promptly gets romantically involved with Janice. Ritchie is a dangerous thug, and Tony has special misgivings about him, complicated once again by the interactions Ritchie exploits with his family.Meanwhile, federal investigators close in on Tony and his organization. It becomes evident that there is a traitor in their midst, but discovering who it is proves very difficult. The suspense surrounding that storyline is my favorite in the entire series, and I take special delight that the web of lies and deception ultimately unravels with the help of a talking fish in one of Tony's best dreams ever. Things are harder for Tony than usual as Dr. Melfi is refusing him treatment, which not only shows how dependant he has become on her, but how vulnerable he is as a human and as a mob boss. The season concludes brilliantly with the resolution of the FBI plant storyline (though I won't say how to allow those who haven't seen it to watch it develop properly) in what must be one of the most psychologically complex and skillfully executed episodes ever aired.Although I personally eschew violence, excessive bad language, and the other components of mob life, this series is so well made and so well acted that it is impossible to not be impressed with it. The drama present in ""The Sopranos"" complete with dark undercurrents, and subtle, occasionally morbid, humor makes this a show worth seeing, and season two is one of the best of the bunch.",5,"Family, Betrayal, And A Talking Fish",1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,2186,"['Sopranos', 'one', 'most', 'innovative', 'creative', 'psychologically', 'intense', 'television', 'shows', 'ever', 'made', 'focus', 'season', 'two', 'increasingly', 'divergent', 'personalities', 'Tony', 'relationships', 'family', 'associates', 'beginning', 'series', 'Tony', 'relative', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'season', 'new', 'different', 'challenges', 'expose', 'week', 'Tony', 'indiscretions', 'take', 'ever-increasing', 'toll', 'relationship', 'wife', 'ultimately', 'whole', 'family', 'hippy', 'sister', 'Janice', 'up', 'warning', 'complete', 'familial', 'emotional', 'torment', 'mother', 'began', 'Unfortunately', 'ultra-violent', 'ambitious', 'Richie', 'Aprile', 'released', 'prison', 'promptly', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Janice', 'Ritchie', 'dangerous', 'thug', 'Tony', 'special', 'misgivings', 'complicated', 'once', 'again', 'interactions', 'Ritchie', 'family.Meanwhile', 'federal', 'investigators', 'close', 'Tony', 'organization', 'evident', 'traitor', 'midst', 'discovering', 'who', 'proves', 'very', 'difficult', 'suspense', 'surrounding', 'storyline', 'favorite', 'entire', 'series', 'take', 'special', 'delight', 'web', 'lies', 'deception', 'ultimately', 'unravels', 'help', 'talking', 'fish', 'one', 'Tony', 'best', 'dreams', 'ever', 'Things', 'are', 'harder', 'Tony', 'usual', 'Dr.', 'Melfi', 'refusing', 'treatment', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'dependant', 'become', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'human', 'mob', 'boss', 'season', 'brilliantly', 'resolution', 'FBI', 'plant', 'storyline', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'allow', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'watch', 'develop', 'properly', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'psychologically', 'complex', 'skillfully', 'executed', 'episodes', 'ever', 'personally', 'eschew', 'violence', 'excessive', 'bad', 'language', 'other', 'components', 'mob', 'life', 'series', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'so', 'well', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'impressed', 'drama', 'present', 'Sopranos', 'complete', 'dark', 'undercurrents', 'subtle', 'occasionally', 'morbid', 'humor', 'show', 'worth', 'seeing', 'season', 'two', 'one', 'best', 'bunch']",N/A

Thanks to those characters, Season 2 grabs hold of you from the very first scene of the first episode and doesn't let go for thirteen hilarious, violent, sad episodes.The story continues to revolve around the massive shoulders and belly of Tony Soprano.  At the end of Season 1, Tony survived a ""hit"" arranged by his Uncle Junior and his mother, Livia.  But family is family, and both Uncle Junior and Livia are still breathing at the outset of Season 2, even though Tony keeps insisting that Livia ""is dead to me.""  Making Tony's family life even more complicated, his opportunistic leech of a sister, Janice, has returned to Jersey from Seattle.  Janice professes to be home to help her dear old mother, but in reality she's back to get on the Tony gravy train, which will be a nice supplement to her 100% disability checks from the State of Washington for her carpal tunnel syndrome.Tony's crime family is also on the rocks, as doubts linger about the possibility of an informer in the ranks.  Sure, they killed one snitch last year, but these guys are like roaches, and the cops continue to sniff just a bit too close at Tony's heels.All the great aspects of Season 1 are back in force - the terrific actors who have been cast in the roles of their lives, the witty writing, the massive budget that allows for one episode to be filmed back in dear old Italia, and the freedom of pay-cable that allows ""The Sopranos"" to revel in the violence and debauchery that follows this hypnotically flawed family.The only aspect of Season 2 that seems to lose a bit of steam is Tony's relationship with Dr. Melfi.  Their relationship grows, but mainly due to distance because we see as many scenes with Dr. Melfi and her own shrink as we do with Dr. Melfi and Tony.  Dr. Melfi remains one of the most beloved characters in the series, to be sure, but the show has the luxury of knowing it's a smash hit and Season 2 allows Tony and Dr. Melfi to let their relationship grow patiently.Oh, and one more thing makes Tony's life a living hell.  Meadow is a gifted high school senior and her dream school is Berkeley, which is pretty much a nightmare for a mob guy from New Jersey with only a semester and a half at Seton Hall under his belt.If you haven't seen ""The Sopranos,"" you must watch Season 1 first - don't dive into this series in mid-stream.

The Sopranos follows the life of Anthony [Tony] Soprano, and his hectic life of being a mob boss. In this season Tony has been put in charge of the entire family, has to deal with new characters that come into his life, such as his sister and the brother of a deceased former boss of the same family, and deal with the life of being a normal father of two. This season is full of twists and turns, and probably a little more violence than the last season, but is still part of a fantastic show...This four disk set comes with 13 episodes including:1] Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist's Office: Tony has been put in charge of the entire family after the old boss, Uncle Junior, had been arrested on a federal indictment. Tony is adjusting to his new life, trying to talk to his old psychiatrist who won't see him, and has a new twist in his life as his sister, Janice, arrives to take care of their mother Livia in her retirement home. Tony tells anyone who asks that is mother is dead to him after she took out a hit on him in the first season and it failed. Also, an old associate of Tony's from his crew returns after mysteriously disappearing in the end of the first season.2] Do Not Resuscitate:  Tony has taken over the income of Uncle Junior's old side of the business, but still allows Junior a small piece of the pie. Tony even intervenes in a construction site where black protestors are picketing based on racial claims. Also one of the crew members of Tony's may have a second side of him that Tony doesn't know about, and that could hurt him badly. Meanwhile Uncle Junior has gotten out of jail but is under house arrest.3] Toodle-F*cking-Do: Tony catches his daughter, Meadow, at a party in his mother's abandoned house when she was moved to the retirement home. Also, Tony's old psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi, finds herself in an embarrassing moment when she bumps into Tony in a restaurant. And a new face appears in the series as the brother of Jackie Aprile [who was a former boss of the family but died of cancer] named Richie, shows up in town after 10 years in jail. Richie came back for one thing, to cut himself in on the action, and he is not afraid of who he rubs the wrong way.4] Commendatori: Tony goes to Italy with two of his crew members, Paulie and his nephew Christopher, to try to get going a car importing business that he inherited from his uncle. Tony is also surprised who the real mob boss there is, and after coming home Tony has a new ally, a new lieutenant named Furio, who will aid Tony in the states.5] Big Girls Don't Cry: Tony's new ally, Furio, proves himself useful in the U.S., and Tony learns a couple of new things about his own father from a family friend. Meanwhile Richie finds a member of the Soprano family he can relate to, and Tony's nephew, Christopher, gets enrolled by his girlfriend, Adriana, into a writing class because he has dreams of being a famous screenwriter.6] The Happy Wanderer: A high school friend of Tony's, David Scatino, has a gambling problem and gets heavily in debt to Richie. After being banned by Richie from any of Richie's poker games, David goes to a game of Tony's and gets heavily in debt to Tony as well. Now Richie and Tony clash [one time in many confrontations between these two as they clashed over Richie reclaiming old turf] over who David should pay back first. Also, Tony is finally in the same room as his mom as they come together for a funeral and Tony sees Richie escorting his mother and Janice into the building.7] D-Girl: As Tony's son, Anthony Jr., gets ready for his confirmation, his apathy starts to disturb Tony and his wife, Carmela, greatly. Meanwhile Christopher, who gets on the set of a movie production thanks to a friend of his who works there, lets out a family secret that eventually makes its way onto a screenplay for a future movie.8] Full Leather Jacket: Worried that her daughter Meadow wont get into college that she wants, Carmela asks a next door neighbor, Jean Cusamano, for help as Jean's sister could write a letter of recommendation. Meanwhile Richie gives Tony a jacket as a peace offering, but what Tony does with the jacket only adds fuel to the fire between him and Richie. Also, two young gangsters, Sean and Matt, look to make names for themselves by pledging their loyalty to Richie with an act that will guarantee everything will turn upside down.9] From Where to Eternity: Christopher has been shot and has an out of body experience which sends Paulie on a trip to a psychic to try and find some answers. Tony and his crew look for the shooter in order to avenge Christopher. Meanwhile Dr. Melfi has been seeing a psychiatrist herself in order to explain her complex relationship with Tony, and also discusses her substance abuse problems. And lastly Carmela wants Tony to have a vasectomy for ""the good of the family.""10] Bust Out: Richie starts to complain to Tony about how Tony is running things and tries to find an alliance with Uncle Junior. Meanwhile Tony realizes there is a witness to a murder he committed and starts to make plans to leave town. However before he goes he makes an unwilling partner of David Scatino, his high school friend who owes him money, with his hardware store. Meanwhile Carmela decides to decorate and finds herself very attracted to the decorator.11] House Arrest: After dodging time in jail, Tony is advised by his lawyer to spend time working at his legitimate business. Uncle Junior finds a way to spend his house arrest time by talking with a widowed wife of a police chief. Tony and Richie also fight once again, this time over drugs that Richie is selling on his routes. And Dr. Melfi creates a scene at a restaurant with her son.12] The Knight in White Satin Armor: Richie and Tony's sister Janice are about to be married, and even though Tony doesn't want Richie near his children he still throws an engagement party for Richie and Janice. Carmela is tired of Tony sleeping with his other woman, but Tony's mistress doesn't want Tony to say goodbye. There is also a BIG surprise in this episode, and it all starts as Janice and Richie settle down to dinner one night.13] Tony is finally forced to sit down and talk to his mother, the same woman who ordered a hit on him last season, to discuss living arrangements for the future. Tony also gets food poisoning, which gives him several weird dreams that hint at something Tony always suspected, but could never really accept. Meadow is about to graduate high school and is on her way to college. And finally Tony and his crew members go on a boating trip, but one of them never returns.This season of the Sopranos is full of twists, turns, and a lot of violence. This is one great show and this season is essential to add to your collection.

We also get to see more about Tony's career choice and how it affects him.  We also get introduced to some new characters, the least of which is his memorable sister Janice.Season 2 the cast and writers seemed to hit a groove, a familiarity and the show just flows along much more naturally.
