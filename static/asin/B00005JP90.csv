We are transported to the naivete' of the 1950's culture like `Good Night and Good Luck' and `Quiz Show' without leaving any clues uncovered.  Exploring the death of TV Superman actor, George Reeves (Ben Affleck), we get more of a film that investigates like `JFK' but feels like `Reversal of Fortune'.  Haunting, yet playful, `Hollywoodland' provides absorbing entertainment.  However, if you're looking for a film that is all neat and tidy, `Hollywoodland' is not for you.Reeves' death is really an odd and unwelcome affair.  Splashed across the headlines, the police have concluded a suicide, somewhat strange back then, and a horror for the children who worshipped their small screen hero.  In the household of private investigator,  Louis Simo`s, (Adrian Brody) son is devastated.  Simo's interest doesn`t stop there, however.  Reeve's mother doesn't believe the report.  That's understandable, but when she hires Simo to investigate, we find that Reeve's had marks on his body, and the trajectory of the inflicting bullet seems odd.  Next, we discover a web of infidelities and broken relationships that present a myriad of possibilities.  Hating publicity, Eddie Mannix, Reeves' studio executive, does everything he can to stop Simo in his tracks.`Hollywoodland' is an intriguing affair that gives a respectful and heartfelt look at Reeves' own life.  Fun-loving and funny, Reeves comes to life with the behind the scenes look at his private life and several stage anecdotes.  For someone who seemed to love life, his death comes across as particularly tragic.  As already indicated, `Hollywoodland' doesn't try to sew up the case, but it makes us ponder his life and his death.  Besides focusing on Reeves, himself, Adrian Brody's excellent performance has us rooting for Simo as well.

Hollywoodland is a wonderful film: part classy, multi-layered film noir and part insightful look at the powerful and destructive pull of fame.Adrien Brody, as usual, commands the screen whenever he appears; he is the attention-hungry detective Louis Simo, who thinks he knows what he wants without knowing what he's got. Ben Affleck gives an understated performance as Reeves, the unlikely Superman who demands not only fame, but the right kind of fame. Both men give outstanding performances.As the story switches back and forth seamlessly from Reeves' life to Simo's investigation of the cause of Superman's death, we are drawn into a world where superficial notoriety is the only commerce.

646034,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B00005JP90,A Customer,"[2, 3]","Partly brilliant and partly forgettable, Hollywoodland features two career making performances from Diane Lane and Ben Affleck - expect a Best Actor Oscar nomination for Ben  - but the film itself suffers from being a clumsy mish-mash of unanswered questions, sly innuendo and fiction which does shed some light on the tortured George Reeve's life, but doesn't really account that well for his death.Using elements of noir and convincingly setting the film in 1959 Los Angeles, director Allen Coulter has shaped a perplexing, frustrating and terribly unfocused film, that ultimately doesn't live up to it's intent. The performances are indeed excellent, even outstanding - but the heavily bifurcated plot structure and an unnecessary framing device slows the film down and you really get the feeling that the filmmakers are trying to frantically stretch something out of a story that just isn't really there.Hollywoodland does a great job of exploring the life of George Reeves (Affleck), portraying him as a drunken, sodden and pain-ridden Hollywood B-grade actor desperate to achieve fame and fortune. The movie starts out soon after Reeve's death when the hipster, drifter P.I. Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) is hired by the actor's mother to search out the truth behind her son's demise. She doesn't believe it was suicide for a minute; he was a big star, she claims, with everything to live for.For the LAPD though, it's an open and shut case - the actor committed suicide. But did he? As the story is unveiled and the various characters are introduced, the suspects gradually line up: There's Reeves vituperative fianc&eacute;, Leonore Lemmon (a fabulous Robin Tunney), an evident gold-digger who was in the house hosting a party when he shot himself upstairs; Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), Reeves' ""sugar mum,"" who loved him dearly and helped him get his start, but was ultimately ditched by him.And of course there's Toni's husband Eddie (Bob Hoskins), who headed a major studio and had reached a certain understanding regarding his wife's adulterous indiscretions, but still loved her dearly. However as the movie choppily shifts between time frames - between Simo's own demons involving guilt over his shattered marriage to his wife Laurie (a lovely Molly Parker) - the mystery becomes less compelling than watching Reeves trying to put to rights his dreams with the reality of being a kept man and a fading actor who is forced to battle chronic pain.Did Reeves commit suicide? The movie certainly lays out the case that he might have been murdered, but it also - pretty convincingly I think - says that he most likely did suicide. But to the movie's ultimate detriment, the facts come out in such a jumbled and bewildering way revealing what might have happened from a number of different perspectives, utilizing a bunch of style sequences - there are unexplained bullet holes and religious cards left at the scene.These sequences stand in a stark contrast to the wonderfully nostalgic flashbacks of Reeves as he meets Toni and she seduces him, his ascendancy to fame, and the ultimate realization that he is a washed-up old drunkard, and also his mounting desolation as he confronts the harsh truth that he's simply not a very good actor. Affleck plays Reeves, which such as great deal of nuance that you really believe that the actor was the reluctant superhero. Reeves hated the role and hated acting to children and to his credit Affleck really gets to the heart of this man's incredibly tortured soul.Diane Lane is of course absolutely lovely as Toni Mannix brilliantly embodying an extraordinary, lustrous and sensual woman who has been callously tossed aside for a younger woman; desperate to keep George by her side even as he starts to drift away hoping for a directing gig in New York. If nothing else, Hollywoodland gives us a cynical view of the Hollywood star machine and how it sweeps anxious young actors up and then spits them out as they buy into the pipe dream that keeps promising stardom and money.It's just a pity that the movie gets caught up in a sense of it's own importance and for most of the time you keep waiting for the real story to get going as the film gets sidetracked by subplots and numerous superfluous scenes that don't really engage the main narrative. Consequently, half the film is brilliant, and half is utterly disposable. Mike Leonard September 06.",3,"""An actor can't always act.

It tries to recreate the 1950s with its styles, and cars. Does it succeed?A client visits a private detective (who works out of his apartment) to have his wife investigated. Lou drives a 1954 Chevrolet, an average car that doesn't attract attention. Lou Simo gets a tip that Reeves' mother does not believe it was a suicide. Lou knows how to get inside information from the coroner's office. Then the story goes back in time, to where Reeves meets Toni Mannix at an expensive nightclub. Lou researches the wristwatch worn by Reeves. The film tells about the lifestyles of the rich and famous.Reeves puts on his ""man of steel"" costume for ""Superman"". He got the job. Lou has trouble with his son. The we see the scenes that were never seen on TV, made to amuse the actors. There were no fingerprints on the Luger, the shell was under the body, no powder burns on the body. Lou investigates the other people present at that party.

Is there any psychological conditioning in TV for kids? Watch and see.]Lou gets a stern warning to stay off the case. [Its like a Raymond Chandler story.] Then a phone call summons Lou to meet his client - and the police are there! There's another flashback to Reeves' past. They show another theory for Reeves' death: a murder for hire. Was Reeves blackballed by Hollywood? Was his future dimming? This film does not offer a definitive solution; it can't.The scenes in this film were very careful to exclude anything that wasn't from the 1950s. Note the lack of airplanes in the sky, or large crowds or traffic. This film would be better if edited for faster pacing and a shorter length. Would that private investigator own such an expensive camera as a late-model Leica? This film seems like a waste given the other events from the 1950s that are more relevant to today's world.

The mother suspects foul play. Simo's theory on the actual cause of death changes as new evidence is uncovered.

He was typecast as superman for life , and the tv series had ended. He was also financially desperate. A good reason to believe he shot himself. But logic will tell you he didn't. With guests just downstairs from his bedroom do you really think he would shoot himself just then and in that moment? Another theory is that a hitman hired by Reeve's former lover's husband (MANNIX) went to the house to shoot him. But this is not logical since a hired gunman could have picked a better time to kill Reeves especially since there were guests in the house. The third theory and what I believe really happened is that he was shot accidentally by Reeve's live-in girlfriend. This explains the two bullets on the floor in the bedroom. This explains why the guests waited 45 minutes to call the police. They needed time to come up with a story.  After viewing Hollywoodland this is the impression I got. The film is beautifully haunting, but hampered by Adrien Brody's relationship to his own family which takes precious screen time away from what we really want to see on the screen. Granted, I understand that this is a story about fathers and sons.  In a way Reeves was a father figure to millions of kids as Brody is to his own son. Afleck as George Reeves just doesn't really work for me.  George was a terrific actor. It's a shame that he never saw it that way playing Superman. The Superman series today is beloved by millions of people all over the world. In the end perhaps Reeves did attain stardom.

But my sense of fair play compels me to congratulate him on his portrayal of George Reeves.  I don't know if it was a labor of love, but Affleck certainly labored, and successfully, to capture the persona and essence of Reeves.  This couldn't have been an easy task.  After all, Reeves wasn't Bogart; he was, indeed, an unimportant and relatively obscure actor.  My assessment of Reeves, while accurate, isn't meant to be harsh.  Although Reeves died before I was born, I grew up watching ""Superman"" and recall the show with great fondness.As for ""Hollywoodland"" itself:  Great idea, poorly executed.  They did a better job than the book, ""Hollywood Kryptonite"", but that's not saying very much.  The acting was fine, but not the plot or structure.  The story, which is indeed a fascinating mystery, wasn't done justice by the storyline.  And the directing was nothing short of somnolent.  I must also mention a moment that startled me.  At the beginning of the scene when an audience is entering a theater to watch a preview of ""From Here to Eternity"", one sees a teenage boy with the kind of haircut no boy had in the 1950s, and wouldn't have until around 1972.  An ""oh, come on!"" blunder, emblematic of a sadly lackadaisical production.  I was also disappointed that the end of the film wasn't followed by a ""what happened to"" Toni Mannix, Leonore Lemmon, Carol von Ronkel, etc.  I'm particularly curious about von Ronkel, who seems to have disappeared into complete obscurity.I do recommend this movie, but reservedly; it's paradoxically worth seeing and a disappointment.",3,An Apology (Of Sorts) to Ben Affleck,1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,1667,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'considered', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'be', 'even', 'remotely', 'good', 'actor', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'sense', 'fair', 'play', 'compels', 'congratulate', 'portrayal', 'George', 'Reeves', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'Affleck', 'certainly', 'labored', 'successfully', 'capture', 'persona', 'essence', 'Reeves', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'task', 'Reeves', 'was', ""n't"", 'Bogart', 'was', 'indeed', 'unimportant', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'actor', 'assessment', 'Reeves', 'accurate', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'harsh', 'Reeves', 'died', 'was', 'born', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Superman', 'recall', 'show', 'great', 'fondness.As', 'Hollywoodland', 'Great', 'idea', 'poorly', 'executed', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'book', 'Hollywood', 'Kryptonite', 'not', 'saying', 'very', 'much', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'not', 'plot', 'structure', 'story', 'indeed', 'fascinating', 'mystery', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'justice', 'storyline', 'directing', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'somnolent', 'must', 'also', 'mention', 'moment', 'startled', 'beginning', 'scene', 'when', 'audience', 'entering', 'theater', 'watch', 'preview', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'one', 'teenage', 'boy', 'kind', 'haircut', 'boy', 'had', '1950s', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', '1972', 'oh', 'come', 'blunder', 'emblematic', 'sadly', 'lackadaisical', 'production', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'end', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'followed', 'happened', 'Toni', 'Mannix', 'Leonore', 'Lemmon', 'Carol', 'von', 'Ronkel', 'etc', ""'m"", 'particularly', 'curious', 'von', 'Ronkel', 'who', 'have', 'disappeared', 'complete', 'obscurity.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'reservedly', 'paradoxically', 'worth', 'seeing', 'disappointment']",N/A

The LAPD labeled it suicide, but private eye Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) is not the only one who isn't buying that line.This is the story of the death of George Reeves, the original Superman. Ben Affleck plays Reeves, and does a sufficiently good job that you can see Reeves instead of Affleck. I can give no higher praise to an actor playing another actor.Reeves died June 16, 1959, when I was 12 and too old to confuse the actor with the role. But the little kids across the country who heard that Superman killed himself must have had a bad time the way Louis Simo's kid did. He burned his Superman costume, which is understandable, but he did it on the living room couch, which is a little strange. So then he has his mother call his father (they are divorced) and refuses to talk to him when he shows up. Needless to say, Simo is pretty confused about the whole thing.He gets a tip that the evidence for its being a suicide was pretty sketchy, there was some evidence that contradicts the theory, and the LAPD is suppressing it. He decides he wants to get at the truth, and incidentally figures there may be some considerable fees in the case. He convinces Reeves' mother to hire him to investigate.In a series of flashbacks, we learn much of what Simo learns as he goes about his investigation. But confusingly, we also get four or five imagined scenarios of the actual shooting, and the first time or two I was under the impression he was ""seeing"" it because he had indeed gotten sufficient information to piece it together. There is nothing obvious that separates the imagined scenes from the ""real"" flashbacks. It is this technique which is not playing fair to the audience in a mystery that has me giving it such a low rating.

646044,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00005JP90,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[7, 9]","It has taken nearly a half-century to finally produce a film about the mystery surrounding 'Superman' George Reeve's death, but it was worth the wait...""Hollywoodland"", despite some minor factual errors, is, perhaps, the finest 'true' Hollywood film ever made. Unflinching in it's willingness to ""name names"", to illustrate the caste system that would make (and break) actors, and the extent the film community controlled both the police and the press, the film works as both a terrific noir-style detective story, and a bittersweet biography of the charming, doomed actor who would become an unwilling hero to a generation of children.The film tells parallel stories, after Reeves' nude corpse is discovered, in June, 1959. The first involves a seedy P.I., Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), who is 'tipped' that Reeves' mother, Helen Bessolo (Lois Smith) believes her son's death was not suicide, but murder, and needs a good investigator to dig up the truth; the second, done in flashback, relates the post-war tale of actor George Reeves (Ben Affleck), who will do anything to jump-start a career 'dead-ended' into 'B' serials by the late '40s. A flirtation with Toni Mannix (Diane Lane, who is superb), the aging but still-sexy wife of MGM exec Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), provides Reeves an 'angel' to promote him, but also erodes his dignity, as he becomes a well-compensated 'gigolo' to Mannix.Simo quickly discovers that the police investigation had been botched, with incongruities (three bullet holes at the crime scene, the murder pistol having been wiped clean), conveniently ignored. A growing list of suspects emerges...could the killer be the jilted lover, Toni Mannix, her overly-protective husband, Eddie, Reeves' coarse ex-fianc&eacute;, Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney)...or someone else?Meanwhile, an embarrassed Reeves auditions for a kiddie show, ""The Adventures of Superman"", never expecting it to get a sponsor...then  sees the show 'picked up', literally changing America's viewing habits, and 'typing' him forever as Superman...costing him any hope of an acting or directing career...The performances are uniformly excellent, with Brody's jaded yet still idealistic Simo both believable and sympathetic. He laughs at the hypocrisy rampant in Hollywood, but is torn by his son's pain over seeing his hero, Reeves, betray his trust by killing himself. The performance nearly equals Lane's complex, anguished portrayal of Toni Mannix, a woman watching the last of her beauty fade, ripped away by losing her younger lover.Ben Affleck deserves a particular 'nod', as Reeves; while bearing only a passing resemblance to the star, at best, he gives the role a depth he has never displayed on-screen, previously. What you see isn't the smug, arrogant Affleck persona of nearly all of his films; instead, you see a sweet, often naughty but likable rogue, who sees his dreams of great roles and screen immortality end in red and blue tights in a 'kiddie' show...the only complaint I have is the nearly cartoonish portrayal Affleck gives, as 'Superman', in the staged AOS scenes and personal appearances; Reeves never portrayed the Man of Steel as a buffoon on TV, or drank heavily before a 'live' appearance; he was too much of a professional, and cared too much about his influence on kids, to give anything less than his best.As I stated earlier, the story occasionally veers from the truth; while it was true that wrestling was considered, when acting and directing jobs 'dried up', ""Superman"" was again picked up, after a season off the air (a fact not mentioned in the film), and Reeves happily planned a return to the steady paycheck of the series, abandoning the wrestling move (with NO 'training' film of an 'out-of-shape' Reeves ever shot); while Eddie Mannix and Reeves were portrayed as enemies, they were, in fact, at least casual friends (Reeves actually started dating Toni BEFORE her marriage, and Eddie was aware she was still involved, afterward); the fact that Reeves' body was embalmed before an autopsy could be performed is never mentioned, but is even further evidence of a police 'cover-up'; Reeves' mother was never 'bought off' to keep her silent; the 'kid-with-a-real-gun' scene never actually occurred (it was actually fabricated by Reeves to try to avoid making appearances in the uncomfortable and embarrassing costume, although his concern about children was genuine). There are other glitches, in the film, as well, but the film DOES accurately tell the story, for the most part.All-in-all, ""Hollywoodland"" is a remarkable film, about a most bittersweet time in my generation's lives.It should not be missed!",5,Engrossing Mystery of TV Superman's Death...,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,4645,"['taken', 'nearly', 'half-century', 'finally', 'produce', 'film',

646046,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,B00005JP90,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[2, 3]","In the Fifties, we had a real Superman, someone who fought for Truth, Justice and the American Way on television.  He wasn't as dapper as Christopher Reeve but George Reeves was the first and foremost Superman.  To us teens back then, he looked old and bulky (not sualve as they do today), but that was the way the male actors in the movies were for the most part then.  All the kids looked up to our Superman as presented on our home t.v. sets.  This kinky film shows the sordid backstage life of a mortal man who had no other roles (he tried in a Sinatra movie and bombed), because of his involvement with a married woman.  Her husband even bought him a nice home for $12,000 which he considered a good investment as he had his own foreign paramour living in his mansion.  He wanted to keep the little wife happy.It's just pretend, making shows on television and movies for the big screen.  Being directed by the person who did 'Sin in the Big City,' that is the sordid way the Superman icon is presented.  Well, he was just plain marvelous as Clark Kent, but his personal identity was humiliating to him and he wanted other things besides being a t.v. performer.  She wanted him as he was and refused to help him further a film career.  Thus, when he found a younger woman and fell in love, she set out on a murderous path of revenge.There were perplexing endings so you can take your pick as to who actually killed him in his own house, or if he did indeed kill himself.  I always believed you every time, he'd told her; I had no idea I could spread so much joy.  There was much more going on that you realize, and the guys were all frauds.  Nothing was as it seemed.  Before he met his demise, he told her, ""You owe me an explanation,"" which he never got.  All he got was a fatal shot in the head.  It was depressing.  One woman commented to me on the way out, that it was well-done.  I repleid that I would have to think about it.Actually, two stories were woven into one: the ill-mannered investigator played by Sean Penn with his sordid life and that of the major characters which made the movie rambling and disjointed.  How's that?  Why's that?  A good biography of the first Superman on the screen, someone we all admired, was not in this movie.  Instead it was like 'Sin in the City' in the Hollywood of the Fifties.  No wonder Eddie went wrong, as he believed in that stuff.  It was all make-believe and dangerous.You can skip this one and watch it on late-nite t.v. in the near future.

In the able hands of THE SOPRANOS director Allen Coulter, the period feel is palpable, too, as is some surprisingly good acting from lead actor Ben Affleck as the Man of Steel, George Reeves.For those not in the know, George Reeves played Superman for Warner Brothers in the 50s and spawned a hero for kids and adults alike. But the truth behind the series' success was that Reeves wanted to do more than just leap tall buildings in a single bound. Trying to break out of the mold of Superman became super-impossible as we witness his attempts to become a serious actor.Being held static was just the tip of Superman's kryptonite, which reveals itself as the sexy and dangerous Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), wife to Warner Brother's manager Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins (MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS). Eddie and Toni have an ""open marriage,"" meaning that each can have affairs with whomever they want, but divorce is out of the question. When Toni takes a liking to George Reeves (Affleck), she forces his life into her hands, making him not just her lover but a sort of male concubine.As the story of George Reeves ""suicide"" progresses, the audience is pulled along via a fictitious private investigator named Louis Simo (Adrien Brody, KING KONG) who is given the tip that Superman's death may not have been by his own hand. Louis tries to dig for the truth, only to butt heads with Eddie Mannix and those who want Reeve's case to remain labeled a suicide. Whether or not Reeve's did kill himself is left up to the viewers interpretation, something that pulls this film up a notch in terms of not spelling everything out for watchers.The big draw was -- to the surprise of many -- the excellent portrayal of George Reeves by the previously wooden or forced Ben Affleck. Trying to erase the stain that was GIGLI or SURVIVING CHRISTMAS might seem impossible but Affleck does it, proving he has acting in his blood and just needs to open a vein and let it leech out into parts that he feels strongly about (apparently he listened to every recording ever made by Reeves and watched all of the Superman TV episodes).Although Adrien Brody got top billing for the film, it is really Affleck that deserved it. Without his excellent take on Reeves, this flick could've easily flopped. Nothing can be taken away from Brody, though. His Louis Simo character is charming, funny, and poignant, but feels too far removed from the real incidents surrounding Reeves' death to make him the mainstay of the movie.",4,Ben Affleck Proves His Metal,1175817600,"04 6, 2007",2007,2587,"['Anyone', 'wanting', 'bit', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'gossip-cum-conspiracy-theory', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'HOLLYWOODLAND', 'able', 'hands', 'THE', 'SOPRANOS', 'director', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'period', 'feel', 'palpable', 'too', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'acting', 'lead', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Man', 'Steel', 'George', 'Reeves.For', 'not', 'know', 'George', 'Reeves', 'played', 'Superman', 'Warner', 'Brothers', '50s', 'spawned', 'hero', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'truth', 'series', 'success', 'was', 'Reeves', 'wanted', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'leap', 'tall', 'buildings', 'single', 'bound', 'Trying', 'break', 'mold', 'Superman', 'became', 'super-impossible', 'witness', 'attempts', 'become', 'serious', 'actor.Being', 'held', 'static', 'was', 'just', 'tip', 'Superman', 'kryptonite', 'sexy', 'dangerous', 'Toni', 'Mannix', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'wife', 'Warner', 'Brother', 'manager', 'Eddie', 'Mannix', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'MRS.', 'HENDERSON', 'PRESENTS', 'Eddie', 'Toni', 'have', 'open', 'marriage', 'meaning', 'can', 'have', 'affairs', 'whomever', 'want', 'divorce', 'question', 'When', 'Toni', 'liking', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Affleck', 'life', 'hands', 'making', 'not', 'just', 'lover', 'sort', 'male', 'concubine.As', 'story', 'George', 'Reeves', 'suicide', 'progresses', 'audience', 'pulled', 'along', 'fictitious', 'private', 'investigator', 'named', 'Louis', 'Simo', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'KING', 'KONG', 'who', 'given', 'tip', 'Superman', 'death', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'own', 'hand', 'Louis', 'dig', 'truth', 'only', 'butt', 'heads', 'Eddie', 'Mannix', 'who', 'want', 'Reeve', 'case', 'remain', 'labeled', 'suicide', 'not', 'Reeve', 'did', 'kill', 'left', 'up', 'viewers', 'interpretation', 'something', 'film', 'up', 'notch', 'terms', 'not', 'spelling', 'everything', 'out', 'watchers.The', 'big', 'draw', 'was', 'surprise', 'many', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'George', 'Reeves', 'previously', 'forced', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Trying', 'erase', 'stain', 'was', 'GIGLI', 'SURVIVING', 'CHRISTMAS', 'might', 'seem', 'impossible', 'Affleck', 'proving', 'acting', 'blood', 'just', 'needs', 'open', 'vein', 'let', 'leech', 'out', 'parts', 'strongly', 'apparently', 'listened', 'recording', 'ever', 'made', 'Reeves', 'watched', 'Superman', 'TV', 'episodes', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'got', 'top', 'billing', 'film', 'really', 'Affleck', 'deserved', 'excellent', 'take', 'Reeves', 'flick', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'flopped', 'Nothing', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'Brody', 'though', 'Louis', 'Simo', 'character', 'charming', 'funny', 'poignant', 'feels', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'real', 'incidents', 'surrounding', 'Reeves', 'death', 'make', 'mainstay', 'movie']",N/A

HOLLYWOODLAND attempts to solve this riddle, and delivers a riveting film experience that will be relished by fans of classic movies.George Reeves (played brilliantly by Ben Affleck) is a small-time Hollywood actor, bumming around various nightspots when he attracts the attention of Toni (Diane Lane), the wife of M-G-M studio executive Eddie E.J. Mannix (Bob Hoskins).  Pretty soon, with the help of Toni's money, George has a comfortable house in Brentwood and a very healthy allowance.  Despite not wanting to do TV, he lands the role of ""Superman"" and unwittingly becomes a hero for children all around the world; film success with a supporting role in ""From Here to Eternity"" still eludes him.  Toni, an older woman, is outraged when George decides to marry Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney) a sexy young starlet.  The stage is set for the fateful night in 1959 when George Reeves was discovered dead from gunshot wounds in his Los Angeles bedroom.HOLLYWOODLAND is a brilliant piece of Neo Noir filmmaking, complete with a struggling, small-time private investigator (played by Adrien Brody) trying to make sense of the crime.  The story of the investigator--Louis Simo--and the actions of Reeves are beautifully-intercut.  As we flip between the past and the present, we slowly learn more about Reeves and his life; but we also learn much more about Louis Simo, his family's breakup and his unhappy young son who is very much traumatised (as were thousands of children) over the death of ""Superman"".HOLLYWOODLAND should be a must-see movie for fans of classic cinema; it features top performances all around (particularly Ben Affleck and Diane Lane), plus an evocative period design.

I would estimate that, in about a third of the indoor scenes, the boom microphone was visible at the top of the frame. Since this kind of goof can now presumably be corrected digitally, why wasn't it? I am immediately pulled out of the viewing experience and reminded that this is A FILM every time the boom intrudes. Maybe it is just me - it seems extraordinarily sloppy for a major release. Now for the good news - Adrien Brody, as the film's protagonist, again demonstrates that he is capable of a broad and subtle range of emotions in front of the camera. His eyes, his voice, even the way he breathes seems completely natural and compelling, even though the character - like virtually all the characters in this movie - can most charitably be described as sleazy. Bravo! Ben Affleck also gives a fine performance - and I have never particularly thought of him as much of an actor. But he makes Reeves interesting and even sympathetic at times. I am a little puzzled by some reviewers' reactions to the multiple possibile conclusions the movie offers. It is apparent from the outset that the movie is not a whodunit - Brody's character never ""solves"" the Reeves' death scenario, so the movie does not eliminate any of the possible explanations of what occurred on the night of Reeves' death.

646055,A278AF56R7J86,B00005JP90,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[3, 3]","This sad story about the mysterious death of George Reeves, TV's first Superman, strikes a chord of pity in your heart as you watch him struggle through life, never knowing if he'd ever earn the respect and acclaim in Hollywood that he desperately wanted.Some might initially be turned off of this film because it co-starrs Ben Affleck, an actor who's real life has somewhat mimicked that of the man he portrays in the sense that he's had a stream of bad luck with movies that bombed in the box office, and personal relationships that were less than helpful to his public image. Still, Ben Affleck has perservered, and has come out on the other side with this stunning performance as a depressed alcoholic who's looking for respect in a business that is largley merciless, and often cruel.QUICK SYNOPSIS: This film begins on the night of George Reeves death. He was found dead in his own home, a gunshot wound to his temple, and was pronounced dead by means of suicide. But some are not so sure. As the film progresses, it takes you back to the beginning days of George's struggle to rise up the Hollywood food chain, and his story is intercut with a present day story of a private detective (Adrian Brody) hired by the actor's mother to prove that George did not commit suicide...he was murdered.Brody's private detective character, Simo, comes off fairly unsympathetic (and the excessive gum chewing gets annoying), though the film tries to generate interest in him by showing the effects George Reeves's death has had on his estranged family, namely his young son who was devestated to learn that his idealized superhero from television was not in reality faster than a speeding bullet. The real story lies with Affleck and George Reeves, and leaves you with a profound, quiet sadness for the deceased actor.The possible murder of George Reeves is obviously the heart of this mystery, but the film doesn't give the audience a clear answer in the end. Throughout the movie it shows three possibilities for the cause of death of George Reeves, but for the most part it leaves it up to the audience to decide for themselves what they think happened. From what I gathered, I think that the final ""option"" they showed might have been meant to illustrate ""what really happened"", but it was still a little ambiguous.

646057,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JP90,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 1]","Superman is supposed to be invincible; he can dodge bullets, bend solid steel, and blow frost from his own mouth. So how is it that a movie about the actor who played Superman in the 1950s--George Reeves--isn't the same way? ""Hollywoodland"" tries hard to be a compelling mystery, but it ultimately forgets that it's relying too heavily on speculation and circumstantial evidence. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing in terms of its entertainment factor, it does make it confusing for those who haven't seen the original ""Adventures of Superman"" television series or even heard of George Reeves. It only goes to show that you can never take a biopic at face value; there's simply no way of knowing what's made up and what isn't.One thing that is well known is that Reeves (played in the film by Ben Affleck) was found shot to death in June of 1959. While the public had been told it was a suicide, there were still some who speculated that he was actually murdered. To this day, it hasn't been proven either way. There's no question that this is interesting material for a film, and ""Hollywoodland"" makes this the main focus of the plot. Freelance private investigator Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) is unofficially brought onto the case by his former partner, who has reason to believe that Reeves met with foul play. I never once got the sense that Simo is the type who can get anything done; not only does he run a disreputable detective agency out of his apartment with his girlfriend, Kit (Caroline Dhavernas), he also handles delicate cases rather haphazardly, as seen with the way he deals with his client, Chester Sinclair (Larry Cedar). Who would hire a man of such low standards?This is but one of the many ways he proves to be the wrong man for the job. It's established very early on that he's recently gotten divorced. It's also established that he has a strained relationship with his young son, Evan (Zach Mills), and it gets even worse after George Reeves' death. Like millions of other young boys around the country, he idolized TV's Superman. Hearing that he shot himself with the same kind of pistol used by Nazis leaves him feeling completely let down; he goes so far as to burn his Superman costume directly on the living room couch. Simo is having a hard time understanding why his son is behaving so strangely, something that doesn't exactly do much to enliven the interactions with his ex-wife, Laurie (Molly Parker).But despite some domestic problems, he still has a job to do. Everything he learns about George Reeves is shown to the audience in the form of flashback sequences. They go back to the early 1950s, which portrays Reeves as a struggling actor who once had a moderately successful career (including a small part in ""Gone with the Wind""). One night at a celebrity dinner event, he happens to meet Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the wife of MGM studio exec Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins). She and Reeves begin a love affair, one that eventually doesn't prove beneficial, despite Toni's lavish gift-giving. Each relies on the other to maintain their status in Hollywood: Reeves needs Toni's influence in order to land a decent role; Toni needs Reeves' celebrity stature to remain the same in order to keep living the high life.He's eventually offered an audition as Superman in a new television series based on the comic book character. While he is given the part, it's not a role he feels especially proud of. He's basically been cast in a cheaply produced children's show, thus limiting his chances at being taken seriously as an actor. From the moment he puts on his exaggerated body suit and looks in the mirror, the audience can clearly see how uncomfortable he is. He looks unnatural, almost as if he were made up to look like a living toy. But whatever misgivings he has about his career, he's well aware of the fact that playing this character guarantees a paycheck.Thus begins Reeves' six-year descent into the world of television. It's a roller coaster ride to say the least; his status is elevated to the point of being recognizable anywhere he goes. He even makes personal appearances, which are just as embarrassing as they are dangerous (at one point, a young boy points a real loaded gun at him, hoping to see the bullets bounce off his chest). Things only go downhill when the show is finally cancelled in 1958. He's now been permanently typecast as the Man of Steel, meaning he's unable to find work (landing a small part in ""From Here to Eternity"" proves disastrous at the film's test screening). The best his agent can offer are wrestling matches, the lowest of the low in Reeves' opinion. Desperate to revive his career, he visits New York. There he meets Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney), a young actress. The two get engaged, and Reeves officially ends his relationship with Toni Mannix.All this is plenty for Simo to work with, even though he's getting dangerously deep into the case. What's worse, his attempts to retrieve information from Reeves' colleagues and friends ultimately prove ineffective. Even Reeves' mother, Helen Bessolo (Lois Smith), isn't that helpful, despite her claim that her son was a fine actor that deserved a statue built in his honor. Simo eventually reverts to smoking and alcoholism, both of which worsen the growing rift between him and his son. Maybe this growing pressure led him to admit that he sees pieces fitting together the way he wants to see them fit. It was an interesting line, but it also underscores the fact that he never should have been given the case. Consider the fact that he imagines three possible scenarios for Reeves' shooting; all of them are investigated, but none of them are proven beyond the shadow of a doubt.From what I've said so far, it would seem that Brody's character is far more developed than anyone else. This, unfortunately, is true, and that bothered me a great deal. If George Reeves' death is supposed to be the main focus of the story, then I want to know more about him and less about the secondary characters. Adrien Brody should not have been the main star of this film; his character is in emotional turmoil, too much to allow for the mystery to sink in. This is bad because ""Hollywoodland"" is a mystery story without a resolution. It ended up becoming a story without feeling; every scene felt flat and uninspired, as if the both the filmmakers and the actors didn't care much for the material. Maybe that's why its pacing is unbearable, going from scene to scene at an almost glacial pace.In my review of ""Superman Returns,"" I said that Superman isn't an interesting character anymore. I certainly don't feel that way about George Reeves; indeed, the fact that he played the world's most famous superhero is an incredibly fascinating subject. I obviously can't separate fact from fiction when it comes to ""Hollywoodland,"" but I can say that I wanted a story with a bit more meaning to it. I guess that when it comes to a weak film, even Superman doesn't have the power to prevent it from losing its way.",3,No One is Faster Than a Speeding Bullet,1157760000,"09 9,

646058,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B00005JP90,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[5, 6]","We can't all be Clark Gable, and that is just one of many sad facts of life. Unfortunately, George Reeves had a tough time accepting this fact. He also, for whatever reason, ended up with a bullet in his head. His inability to accept who he was led to his tragic life, that bullet led to his tragic death. Ben Affleck turns in a very fine performance as George Reeves who is most well known for playing Superman on TV in the 50's. Like most actors, now and then, Reeves did not see satisfying the public's appetite for bad TV as honorable work. But since that appetite seems to be insatiable, it certainly paid the rent for him. Reeves wanted more for his career, he wanted to do movies, he wanted to direct, he wanted the roles Clark Gable was getting. This predicament quickly led him down a dubious path that caused him to get in over his head at MGM. Whether it MGM, his low class girlfriend, or himself that pulled the trigger, one thing is certain, this Superman was killed by his runaway ego.The film itself is a minor success. Allen Coulter, best known for his work on ""The Sopranos,"" makes his film debut here and provides us with an adequate real life murder mystery. He does manage to nail a few money shots here the same way he does on TV, by pretending that they aren't money shots. An ordinary scene becomes very extraordinary with one quick swoop of the camera. Besides Affleck's above average performance the film benefits from another strong performance by Adrien Brody (as always). He is the private investigator who is the only one brave enough not to swallow the party line. Robin Tunney also does good work as she has a ball trashing it up as Reeves girlfriend. The fact that the performance is just a stunt should not be held against her. The film did leave me feeling cold and disconnected. The heavy handedness is to be expected considering the players involved, but this is above and beyond the call of duty.My final question is why make this film. The filmmakers don't have a clear theory on who killed Reeves, although they don't seem to be buying the suicide story. Still, to reopen the case at this point would just be silly. I think the goal was probably just to illustrate a story out of Hollywood's history book. Hollywood can kill ya kid, and here's how. It's not all easy sex and expensive toys as you might find on ""Entourage."" Of course, sex does exist here, but it is used as currency to enhance ones career. That said Reeves may have been headed towards suicide one way or the other, and most actors would have killed for his career. Most actors also probably understand that power politics and bad scripts are part of the game. So maybe we can look at this film and see George Reeves as a red light for this generation. Today every half wit out there thinks they are going to be the recipient of stratospheric success simply because an ad for a community college told them so. Maybe George Reeves can show this generation that there is no honor in refusing to acknowledge the gift of today simply because you are too worried about tomorrow. ***1/4",3,The Harsh Glow of Hollywood,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,3086,"['ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'sad', 'facts', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'George', 'Reeves', 'had', 'tough', 'time', 'accepting', 'fact', 'also', 'reason', 'ended', 'up', 'bullet', 'head', 'inability', 'accept', 'who', 'was', 'led', 'tragic', 'life', 'led', 'tragic', 'death', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'very', 'fine', 'performance', 'George', 'Reeves', 'who', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'playing', 'Superman', 'TV', '50', 'most', 'actors', 'now', 'then', 'Reeves', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'satisfying', 'public', 'appetite', 'bad', 'TV', 'honorable', 'work', 'appetite', 'be', 'insatiable', 'certainly', 'paid', 'rent', 'Reeves', 'wanted', 'more', 'career', 'wanted', 'do', 'movies', 'wanted', 'direct', 'wanted', 'roles', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'was', 'getting', 'predicament', 'quickly', 'led', 'down', 'dubious', 'path', 'caused', 'get', 'head', 'MGM', 'MGM', 'low', 'class', 'girlfriend', 'pulled', 'trigger', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'Superman', 'was', 'killed', 'runaway', 'ego.The', 'film', 'minor', 'success', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'Sopranos', 'film', 'debut', 'here', 'adequate', 'real', 'life', 'murder', 'mystery', 'manage', 'nail', 'few', 'money', 'shots', 'here', 'same', 'way', 'TV', 'pretending', 'are', ""n't"", 'money', 'shots', 'ordinary', 'scene', 'very', 'extraordinary', 'one', 'quick', 'swoop', 'camera', 'Affleck', 'above', 'average', 'performance', 'film', 'benefits', 'strong', 'performance', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'always', 'private', 'investigator', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'brave', 'enough', 'not', 'swallow', 'party', 'line', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'also', 'good', 'work', 'ball', 'trashing', 'up', 'Reeves', 'girlfriend', 'fact', 'performance', 'just', 'stunt', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'held', 'film', 'did', 'leave', 'feeling', 'cold', 'disconnected', 'heavy', 'handedness', 'be', 'expected', 'considering', 'players', 'involved', 'above', 'call', 'duty.My', 'final', 'question', 'why', 'make', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clear', 'theory', 'who', 'killed', 'Reeves', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'buying', 'suicide', 'story', 'Still', 'reopen', 'case', 'point', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'silly', 'think', 'goal', 'was', 'probably', 'just', 'illustrate', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'book', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'kill', 'ya', 'kid', 'here', 'how', 'not', 'easy', 'sex', 'expensive', 'toys', 'might', 'find', 'Entourage', 'course', 'sex', 'exist', 'here', 'used', 'currency', 'enhance', 'ones', 'career', 'said', 'Reeves', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'headed', 'towards', 'suicide', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'most', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'career', 'Most', 'actors', 'also', 'probably', 'understand', 'power', 'politics', 'bad', 'scripts', 'are', 'part', 'game', 'So', 'maybe', 'can', 'look', 'film', 'see', 'George', 'Reeves', 'red', 'light', 'generation', 'Today', 'half', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'recipient', 'stratospheric', 'success', 'simply', 'ad', 'community', 'college', 'told', 'so', 'Maybe', 'George', 'Reeves', 'can', 'show', 'generation', 'honor', 'refusing', 'acknowledge', 'gift', 'today', 'simply', 'are', 'too', 'worried', 'tomorrow', '***1/4']",N/A

Hollywoodland (dumb title personally) shows something else: what if the actor playing Superman was stuck in that persona and couldn't shake off the image. Lately we seem to be in Superman mode: we had Superman Returns, this, the DVD release of all 4 Christopher Reeve movies and of course the animated series is available. Is this a good entry into the Superman mythos? Only when it actually stays centered on it.There's 2 stories running in Hollywoodland: George Reeves, previously seen in Gone With the Wind, lands the job as the Man of Steel himself on the television series Adventures of Superman. While not the most lavish and professional looking show, it developed a massive following with kids and adults. But, he was unable to shake off his persona after the show gets cancelled and can't find work since all people think of is Superman. Having an affair with MGM executive Eddie Mannix's wife, Toni and battling depression and alcoholism, he reportedly killed himself on June 16, 1959.The other end of the story is Louis Sima, a private investigator who's hired by Reeves' mother to investigate whether it was a suicide or possibly a murder. Having to deal with a drinking problem, a son shaken by Reeves' death, it gets worse when a number of suspects pop up, including Toni, Eddie and Reeves' fiance Leonore Lemmon. He investigates the possibility that there's more to a suicide than was publicized but also people who don't want people to know.Judging from both stories you'd see that one seems more interesting than the other. And of all people, it's Ben Affleck that's the standout here who's able to show the frustration of trying to be more than people will allow him to be. Known more for the whole ""Bennifer"" thing and so-called ""movies"", he seems to use that extensively and any time the story shifts to admittedly good Adrien Brody, you kind of feel like ""ugh, go back to Ben"". Who knew one day you'd want to see Ben more? That's how good he is. The other actors are great too, especially Diane Lane but the film is basically a great biopic mixed in with a subpar detective story. At least it's way better than the Black Dahlia.How's one judge Hollywoodland? If you base it on the Reeves story, it's solid.

L.A. gumshoe Louis Simo played nicely by Adrien Brody, at the behest of Reeve's doting mother is investigating the circumstances behind his death.  Meanwhile the later stages of Reeves life is examined in retrospective fashion.  Reeves played surprisingly well by a too often wooden Ben Affleck is battling depression and alcoholism.  Despite achieving intense fame in his portrayal of Superman, he is unable to land serious movie roles.  He is in effect being kept by his married lover Toni Maddox, played by star of the film, Diane Lane.  Lane is married to powerful MGM honcho Eddie Maddox played by an ancient looking Bob Hoskins.Reeves eventually dumps his lover for a younger model played by a manipulative, gold digging Robin Tunney giving both she and Lane motive for killing him.  Brody also uncovers a connection to organized crime with a vengeful Hoskins, also making him a suspect.The highlight of the film however was not the acting but the sets.

646072,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JP90,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","The interwoven circumstances around the mysterious death of actor George Reeves, who peaked in popularity as TV's ""Superman"" in the 1950's, provide the leitmotif of this 2006 period mystery directed by feature film first-timer Allen Coulter. It's a visually interesting film with a mildly compelling plot based on fact, but echoes of Curtis Hanson's ""LA Confidential"" and even Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"" make this movie feel trivial by comparison.  One reason is that the subject is not presented as a very intriguing figure. As portrayed fittingly by the media-saturated Ben Affleck, Reeves is a struggling B-film actor who finds almost instant fame on the then-burgeoning medium of TV as a mythic superhero of whom he is most embarrassed to play.The other problem with the film is that Coulter and screenwriter Paul Bernbaum overwhelm the narrative with three subplots on top of the three possible scenarios behind Reeves' death in 1959. The filmmakers are right in assuming the story of his death is not fascinating enough by itself for a major studio film, but I think they err in thinking the diversity of story points amounts to something more substantive. The plot consists of two parallel tracks - Reeves' story in a selective flashback starting a decade prior to his death, and the other the week-long investigation of the death by a fictionalized detective named Louis Simo. The stories are intercut in a way to uncover the various motivations behind the actor's death and how they could have played out.The episodes with Reeves have a nostalgic, often glamorous sheen even if his life is presented in fairly pat terms. At the legendary Cocoanut Grove, he meets the seven-years older Toni Mannix, the needy wife of vicious MGM studio executive Eddie Mannix. Over the next ten years, Toni carries on an adulterous affair with Reeves with her husband's approval and funds the actor's livelihood with money, a house and a car. The episodes with the down-and-out Simo play out like a Bogart movie knock-off as he is recruited by Reeves' closed-lipped mother to prove it was murder. This is where the film gets contrived and overly ambitious with Simo presented as Reeves' kindred spirit, both men who think they deserve a better lot in life than they got. Investigating a case involving a cuckolded husband and also dealing with problems on the domestic front, Simo is simply not as interesting as the filmmakers want us to believe. The net result is an imbalanced film with little pay-off.For all the press he received during its initial release, Affleck is merely serviceable as Reeves, even though his smooth effort here shows how much he empathizes with the late actor. Unsurprisingly, he is at his best when he displays Reeves' glib faade. I have to give Diane Lane credit for aging herself without vanity as Toni, although the actress's natural radiance undermines her credibility as an insecure older woman. I never got a palpable sense of the age difference until she moves into Joan Crawford territory toward the end. However, the real spoiler is Adrien Brody, who seems physically wrong and too youthful as Simo. Wiry and looking far too contemporary (the same problem he had in ""King Kong""), he does a lot of posturing to make himself look cynically cool, but the ruse doesn't work. Brody just seems anachronistic except for one poignant scene where he drunkenly attempts to pick up his young son from school.Bob Hoskins effectively goes back to nasty ""The Long Good Friday"" mode as Eddie, while Robin Tunney does solid work as Reeves' tawdry fianc&eacute;e, club-hopping starlet Leonore Lemmon. Exceptional work by cinematographer Jonathan Freeman and production designer Leslie McDonald help evoke the period convincingly. The DVD contains an informative and articulate commentary track by Coulter.

It is not the true crime movie one might expect, as there are enough crime scene/investigation oddities to arouse suspicions, but not enough to captivate or grip with suspense.  Nor is Hollywoodland much of a bio pic, as it reveals little about George Reeves; whether his death or his life, we are kept outside never to know him.  The 3 main characters (played by Brody, Affleck, and Lane) are detached, relationally dysfunctional, dissatisfied, and uncertain of their life place.  The story--both the facts and the emotion-- is primarily told through flashbacks and Brody's character, private investigator Louis Simo, whose situation in several ways mirrors Reeves'.  At the outset we see Reeves interject himself into a newspaper photo (a career advancing stunt also employed by Simo), which is how he came to meet Lane's character, Mrs. Toni Mannix, MGM's general manager's wife who became the elder lover of Reeves and his benefactor, even buying him a house.  Superman eventually is cancelled and Reeves, now too recognized as the superhero to get other parts, hits so low that he films himself exercising in a pitiful attempt to prove he's fit enough for a job on the professional wrestling circuit.  Yet, before he goes through with this we see him break with Toni Mannix and travel to New York to ""take charge"" of his own life by setting up projects, directing and producing.  He later dumps Mannix, telling her that a Miss Lemon he met in New York makes him feel young.  (Lemon is later overheard losing her cool when Reeves refuses to marry her, another potential suspect.)  All the while, Limo displays the same combination of aspirations accompanied by inability to fulfill them and no one to share them with.  Overall, Hollywoodland conveys a sensation of emptiness and is more contemplative than entertaining, but for those of us who ponder head on such universal questions of significance, this movie is intelligent and appreciated.  It is rather poetic that here was a Superman more powerful than a locomotive, yet so personally impotent, whether by circumstance or choice.  Particularly moving was a recurring scene whenever Simo was imagining the night of Reeves' death and mentally replaying Reeves' final moments:  we'd see Reeves before retiring to his room and final moments, in the company of houseguests, looking detached and strumming an acoustic guitar while singing the most wistful Spanish song, quite sad.  Yet whether Reeves was shot ""like a dog,"" whether the gun accidentally fired in an argument; or whether it was suicidal despair, Simo never comes to know and it appears no one cares--not even Reeves' mother, who withdrew her request for Simo's services after MGM promised to build a monument of her son (to her?).

It recalled that bygone era when entering a movie theater was more than making a stop at the outrageously priced popcorn concession on the way into a tacky multiplex cubicle. Movie theaters themselves, whether they purported to be dimly-lit frescoed Egyptian temples or dusk-enshrouded palaces with glittering stars implanted in the ceilings, provided magical settings for the flickering images that transported audiences wherever the movie producers chose to take them. The Film Stars who twinkled in the Hollywood firmament had the glamor of distance, and the Big Studio Moghuls had teams of publicity men to make sure that the dark side of the silver screen was never even glimpsed.

Affleck shows that he really can act, and it is fascinating to learn just how Reeves really felt about the role that made him famous. To see ""Superman"", lying on his back, swilling booze from a hip-flask, makes this movie almost worth the price of purchase... Almost.Unfortunately, there just aren't enough scenes featuring Affleck. The scenes about Reeves are flashbacks to the main plotline, about Adrian Brody's character, a private detective who has been hired to investigate Reeves's death. Adrian Brody has never appealed to me and after seeing this film I don't feel inspired to ever see another film that he is in. Too much of the film time is devoted to Brody's character and his personal problems, and yet I did not find this character to be remotely appealling and by the end of the film I was just bored by him.Given the lurid subject matter, this film should have been much better. I had hoped for something along the lines of ""Auto Focus"", the biopic about Bob Crane (of ""Hogan's Heroes"" fame).

646088,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JP90,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","HOLLYWOODLAND is a very long (two hours plus) film noir that is actually a film khaki: the droning muted brown to ochre tones of the film itself match the story well - and that is not necessarily a compliment.  The 'unresolved' death of B-grade actor George Reeves who was disconsolate at having his crowning achievement be the Superman role (my, how times have changed!) is the subject of this story as written by Paul Bernbaum (best known for his ongoing 'Halloweentown' series) and directed by Allen Coulter whose credentials as a TV director are impressive.  With a cast of top-notch actors this should have been a surefire hit, but somehow being unable to care about any of the characters in the film makes it leaden.Though the film takes place in 1959 (the death by suicide vs possible homicide) the action spreads into the early 50s as Reeves (Ben Affleck) stumbles up the rickety Hollywood ladder of minor roles, alcohol and carousing until he meets aging Toni Mannix (Diane Lane) whose marriage of convenience to super producer Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins) leads to his attaining the role of Superman and the accompanying position of being Toni's lover.  The story weaves rather aimlessly through Reeves' checkered life with paramour Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney) and influences from well-meaning supporters.  But while we watch this rather tepid Hollywood wannabe climb we are escorted by the investigation of his death by one Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) who has been hired by Reeves' mother Helen Bessolo (the always fine Lois Smith) to prove that her 'brilliant actor' son was murdered.The suicide death of Reeves is an open and shut case with the LAPD until Simo tinkers with the evidence, all the while ignoring his rather smarmy career as a private investigation, a distraction which leads to its own dire consequences.  Simo also encounters problems with his ex-wife Laurie (Molly Parker) and his young son disillusioned that Superman would kill himself.  The facts of Reeves' life parallel with the facts of Simo's life and the manner in which Coulter works with this data places past with present, Reeves with Simo in tightly connected frames so that we never know whose is coming into the next dark space: it becomes a bit tedious and confusing, but in the end it is all bleak and disjointed.The actors try hard to salvage this film and there are some good performances here.

Also like many of those kids, I never understood why someone who SEEMED to be a huge success would kill himself.  The fact that it has always been described as an unsolved case, despite the suicide declaration, has also kept my interest alive all these years.  And purely from this point of interest, Hollywoodland was a very good movie for me to see.  If the film's ""facts"" are anywhere close to as accurate as its Director, Writer, and Actors claim in the Special Features section, it has filled in a lot of gaps for me.I should also note that I think 98% of the acting was terrific -- Hoskins and Lane are magnificent here, and both Brody and Affleck did much better than I expected.  Also, the period details in the costumes and art direction were very well done, and the dialogue is excellent.That said, although I understand what they were trying to do with the ""private eye"" approach to the story's exposition, in this case the approach comes off as hackneyed and cheesy.  In particular, Brody's detective gets beat up some here to sorrowful effect, but at many points his scenes were so unrealistic -- particularly those where he interacts with reporters -- that I wanted to knock him around myself.  Those parts of the film really did remind me of old films, or at least the bad part of old films.Since these reviews are supposed to tell customers whether it's a good idea to buy the products, I have to say that in this case, I suggest customers note that, at the time of this writing, there are 137 used copies of this movie starting at $1.50.

It made little sense. I knew you couldn't kill Superman.Hollywoodland, a new film attempting to shed light on the controversy surrounding Reeve's death, begs for an answer to the mystery, but comes full circle, like so many traumatized baby boomers, concluding again that you can't kill Superman. It's almost a cynical, Yes Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus, epitaph, where you sit the inner child down and firmly say, ""Child, sometimes even Superman has to put the gun to his temple and pull the trigger."".  The inner child firmly believes that kryptonite killed George Reeves, while the film asks us to reconsider that maybe George Reeves killed George Reeves. And then again, maybe not.So beyond being a film investigating Reeve's death, it is more intent on bringing closure to legions of baby boomers who have been lugging around the death of Superman in the deep recesses of their minds. A wizened, adult maturity seems to close the film, while a convincing argument on the murder of Reeves would have been preferred. As far as murder mysteries go, there is just not enough here to support a murder and conspiracy. And as little to support a suicide.Reeves, portrayed by Ben Affleck, is revealed as an out of work actor with only a Gone With The Wind screen credit to indicate any pre-history of the character, (I remember seeing Reeves flare up on the screen the first time I saw, Gone With The Wind, - ""Hey, it's Superman!""). There is little mention of his life before his near middle-aged character is introduced, no marriages, no relationships, and it's difficult to accept him as the swinging heterosexual bachelor, who never married, that the film portrays. He's sort of just there, as if having just arrived, hanging around Hollywood waiting for a job. Yet still, Affleck's Reeves is convincing and sympathetic, but never truly exposed biographically. The film's flashing back and forth from the not so distant past to the not so distant future, gets a bit 'tennis game' monotonous, and the inclusion of several false leads, that wander down paths of their own, is boggling. But for all it's half-baked wonders, it remains a captivating film, rich in an undisclosed decadence, and always on the verge of revealing the truth behind the death of George Reeves, even as it concludes without truly delivering the goods.The TV show, Superman, and Reeves himself, are seen, and since this film has been released, are acknowledged as second-rate TV, and second rate acting. The actor deeply convinced a generation of children that heroic qualities can exist, and Reeves transformation from earthly Clark Kent to stupendous Superman, was always a skillfull characterization. The show itself, made on a pitiful budget, offered wonderful supporting players, taut exciting scripts, and a sly wink at it's own heroic camp.In Hollywoodland, we reexamine our reaction to the news that Superman, George Reeves, shot himself to death.

The mysterious circumstances that surrounded his death allows to Allen Cutler to make a double level narration, the first lecture has to with the meandering process of investigation when a minor private eye (with a messy sentimental life)is hired by the mother of Reeves in order to get beyond the official version and the headlines, because she is sure her son didn't commit suicide. The second narrative line deals with the life and times if Reeves, his hopes and efforts to achieve the stardom.But what we usually ignore is what's behind stages. If ""all about Eve"" and ""Sunset boulevard"" were perhaps the first major films to reveal the interiorities of this variegated and random world of fame, applauses, flashes and autographs, where nothing is like it seems; as more the investigator gets close the core of the truth more elusive his conclusions are due there are many interests and opposite interests in conflict.This dramatis personae will even affect the real private life of this cheap private eye, the children don't distinguish the difference between what's real or what's fiction and the suicide of Reeves arouses a sharp reflection about the influence of the movies over the quotidian reality of many people.On the other hand, we have that silent duel of vanities, prides wounded egos, ambition and coldness that nestle behind the camera.Bob Hoskins steals the show as MGM's Vice President, despite he develops a supporting role; Diane Lane makes a realistic performance as the bored and cheated wife, who works out as the ""Greek foot"" to Reeves. She will aim him and more than a lover she will become the builder of the golden stairway for Reeves reaches and achieves his fifteen minutes of glory according the famous Warhol's statement.A film that will make us to remind the first line of Led Zepellin `s Stairway to heaven : ""There's a lady who's sure all that glitters it's gold...""",5,Hollywood: a magic carpet ride!,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,2020,"['George', 'Reeves', 'death', 'dramatic', 'pivot', 'will', 'permit', 'get', 'inside', 'dream', 'factory', 'Hollywood', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'surrounded', 'death', 'Allen', 'Cutler', 'make', 'double', 'level', 'narration', 'first', 'lecture', 'meandering', 'process', 'investigation', 'when', 'minor', 'private', 'eye', 'messy', 'sentimental', 'life', 'hired', 'mother', 'Reeves', 'order', 'get', 'official', 'version', 'headlines', 'sure', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'suicide', 'second', 'narrative', 'line', 'deals', 'life', 'times', 'Reeves', 'hopes', 'efforts', 'achieve', 'stardom.But', 'what', 'usually', 'ignore', 'what', 'behind', 'stages', 'Eve', 'Sunset', 'boulevard', 'were', 'perhaps', 'first', 'major', 'films', 'reveal', 'interiorities', 'variegated', 'random', 'world', 'fame', 'applauses', 'flashes', 'autographs', 'where', 'nothing', 'more', 'investigator', 'close', 'core', 'truth', 'more', 'elusive', 'conclusions', 'are', 'due', 'are', 'many', 'interests', 'opposite', 'interests', 'conflict.This', 'dramatis', 'personae', 'will', 'even', 'affect', 'real', 'private', 'life', 'cheap', 'private', 'eye', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'distinguish', 'difference', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'fiction', 'suicide', 'Reeves', 'sharp', 'reflection', 'influence', 'movies', 'quotidian', 'reality', 'many', 'people.On', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'silent', 'duel', 'vanities', 'prides', 'wounded', 'egos', 'ambition', 'coldness', 'nestle', 'camera.Bob', 'Hoskins', 'show', 'MGM', 'Vice', 'President', 'supporting', 'role', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'realistic', 'performance', 'bored', 'cheated', 'wife', 'who', 'out', 'Greek', 'foot', 'Reeves', 'will', 'aim', 'more', 'lover', 'will', 'become', 'builder', 'golden', 'stairway', 'Reeves', 'reaches', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'glory', 'according', 'famous', 'Warhol', 'statement.A', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'remind', 'first', 'line', 'Led', 'Zepellin', 's', 'Stairway', 'heaven', 'lady', 'who', 'sure', 'gold']",N/A

The more intriguing story is the bio-pic aspect (which they should have completely focused on); the ""mystery"" part of the film about an investigation into whether George Reeves did or did not kill himself, is both uninteresting and left completely unanswered. Contrary to other so-called Amazon ""critics"" of this film, the pathetic death of George Reeves is no great unsolved crime, except in the minds of some aging baby-boomers who just can't let go of their childhood hero.

646095,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00005JP90,James Hiller,"[1, 2]","How many times in our society do we need to reflect upon the hateful, cruel side of the entertainment industry? The casual dismissal of people in movies because they are no longer new and exciting, or have been molded into a personality that cannot be shaken. As we stand in our lines to see pictures, or wait with bated anticipation at the next awards show, do we reflect upon the thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who have literally given their lives for those celebrities? At what cost do we value celebrity? Hollywoodland doesn't ever pretend to launch into such lofty discourse, or attempt to answer that question. It's about one man's arc through that process, and how, if ever, he comes out on the other end.Hollywoodland blends the tragic, unfortuante suicide of George Reeves, 1950 TV's Superman, into a detective story, with interesting if ultimately unsatisfying results. George Reeves, nailed in his ""should be awarded"" performance by Ben Affleck, starts the movie a suave, desparate playboy, wanting to find his footing in Hollywood, only to land in the bed of a movie mogul's wife, played by Diane Lane (whatever happened to Cherry in the Outsiders?). During his kept period, George finds employment in a hack TV project, ""Superman"", and much to his chagrin, rockets to popularity with children around the country. Thus, Reeves enters his dilemma; a desire to do good, meaningful work versus that infernal celebrity that television brings.The movie starts with Reeves' death, and the entrance of fictional Louis Simo, a hack detective, riddled with the stereotypical family movie issue (distant dad, miscreant son... Hook... Night at the Museum...hello?), slowly slides into the murder investigation, dancing along the police, who quickly rule it a suicide. Simo's path is predictable, but that's okay, because the real story, the story of Reeves, should be the focus. It's with Reeves that our sympathies lie. It's with his death that he finally achieves his ill-begotten memories.Hollywoodland examines celebrity through the life of one actor. Sad? Yes. Tragic? Most definitely. Answers? None. The sadness we feel is the same sadness Toni Mannix must have felt upon hearing the news that her long time lover, recently estranged, was dead. And it is only with a film like Hollywoodland, that we continue to look at the price we pay whenever we demand more of celebrity than we are willing to pay.

I was mildly shocked, years later, when I heard that the show's star, George Reeves, had killed himself. As the story was told, he had gone crazy, jumping out of a building thinking he could fly like the character he played. Shows what I knew about the way TV shows were made.I liked George Reeves - the actor I saw on Superman. As Clark Kent, he had the sly kind of wise-guy outlook that made him instantly likeable. As Superman, he was tough and no-nonsense an a little pudgy, maybe. Just the kind of guy who would fight for truth justice and the American way.""Hollywoodland"" takes a crack at exploring the George Reeves story. It hints at Reeves' early brushes with fame, as one of the Tarleton Twins in ""Gone with the Wind."" But Revees's career never caught fire - at least in the way he expected or hoped. Falling into a throwaway role of the man from Krypton, he was unhappy. The adulation of million of youngsters could not salve his desire to be a serious actor. But his time had come and done. At age 45, a bullet ended his life.""Hollywoodland"" parallels Reeves's story with that of a semi-fictional private detective - Louis Simo, played by Adrien Brody in an Oscar-worthy performance. Like Reeve's, Simo is desperate to associate himself with fame. His obsession has lost him his marriage, a regular job and perhaps even his relationship with his young son. Ever anxious to make the big splash, he happens upon the Reeve's case and tries to make something of it. But soon, the case gets ahold of him. He tries to pin the death on various people - Reeve's fianc&eacute;, then his lover's husband. His quest for fame and for answers mirrors the lack of focus in his own life. As he works through the various scenarios for Reeves' death, and gets closer to the truth, he wrestles and conquers his own demons, working himself back toward sanity and reality.Brody is incredible. He communicates tension just by the way he oozes up a stairway. The rest of the cast is wonderful as well. Diane Lane, as Reeves' suger mama Toni Mannix, was luscious and pathetic as his just-past-youth lover. Bob Hopkins, as MGM money man Eddie Mannix was suitably gruff and menacing. Only Ben Affleck was less than he needed to be. Reeves filled up more screen volume than Affleck, who exudes only a few dim rays of Reeve's infectious bonhomie. The writers also need to be picked on. The span of time portrayed in the movie - over 10 years--was not apparent from the car styles or music or script. It was a shock to see Toni growing old, when her boy Ben seemed not to age at all. And frankly, no modern film seems to have captured the styles and rhythms of the 1950s. No modern actor wants to have his hair cut as short as 50s style dictated.Carping aside, ""Hollywoodland"" is a finely crafted piece of cinematic drama that is watchable and rewatchable. The story is fascinating enough, and made more so by the story telling. In line with our post-modern aversion to definitive truths, the film does not flatly state how George Reeve's died. But by the end, its clear in which direction reality is found, and in which way fame, desperation and madness.

I am not sure how much liberty HOLLYWOODLAND takes regarding the details of Mr. Reeves' life and untimely demise, but the film makes its point in how the quest to be great can become the enemy of simply being good.In HOLLYWOODLAND Ben Affleck delivers a career performance portraying television star George Reeves, who seemingly kills himself because he was unable to find acting jobs he wanted. Almost as good as Mr. Affleck are Diane Lane as Toni Mannix, Reeves' lover; and Adrian Brody as the fictional private detective Louis Simo, who thinks domestic violence or organized crime may have been the real cause of George Reeves' death.Perhaps George Reeves should have lived with letting his television work be good enough. HOLLYWOODLAND protagonist sleuth Louis Simo, not content to earn a living being hired to catch unfaithful spouses, reaches for glory as he attempts to prove the gun that took Mr. Reeves' life was not in his own hand.Had we not lost George Reeves, who knows, the roles he wanted may have come. As for Louis Simo, his obsession to prove Mr. Reeves did not commit suicide distracts him from one of his routine assignments, a case that ends in tragedy.

646099,A3OFB18116P6RM,B00005JP90,J. L. Reimer,"[5, 6]","June 16, 1959. The day George Reeves, the man who was Superman, died. Was it suicide as officially reported or murder? And if it was murder, who did it? This is the central question in the film 'Hollywoodland'.On the surface, 'Hollywoodland' and 'The Black Dahlia', released within a week of each other, are very similar. Both deal with the investigation of a real life mystery in Hollywood during the years following World War II. However, each approaches its subject differently. In the case of 'Hollywoodland', the noirish film combines drama and docudrama.The film begins with the death of George Reeves before introducing the fictional detective, Louis Simo (inspired by a real detective who investigated the death of George Reeves). As the film moves back and forth between Simo's investigation and Reeves' life of trying to become a successful film actor in the Hollywood system but instead becoming typecast as the Man of Steel on television, it is clear Reeves' life is being recreated through the knowledge, theories and conclusions of the investigation. Through Simo's eyes, the film presents the ambiguous evidence and provides several theories of George Reeves' death.'Hollywoodland' features a strong cast headed by Adrian Brody as Louis Simo. Simo is a complicated and flawed character; a detective committed more to making money from an investigation than doing the investigation and willing to manipulate the media or his client to his benefit. However, he also proves to be a loving father with more reason to further his investigation into Reeves' death due to the despondency of his son over his television superhero's death.The cast portraying real people is equally strong with Bob Hoskins as studio head Eddie Mannix, Robin Tunney as Reeves' fianc&eacute;e Leonore Lemmon and Lois Smith as Reeves' mother Helen Bessolo but Diane Lane stands out as Reeves' girlfriend and Eddie Mannix' wife Toni Mannix. A long-time force in Reeves' life she glides from a strong confident woman in the beginning of their relationship to desperation as she tries to maintain control of him and finally to an aging broken woman.Along with Diane Lane, Ben Affleck's performance as George Reeves also stands out. While he only superficially looks like Reeves, despite the added weight, that quickly becomes forgotten and unimportant as Affleck's mannerisms, stance and voice transform him into the man who reluctantly became Superman.Although not without flaws, which initially make it difficult to tell that Reeves' life is being seen through Simo's eyes, 'Hollywoodland' is an excellent film. It has a strong script, strong cast, great characters and interesting story told in an interesting way about a beloved yet tragic actor during the Golden Age of Hollywood. While the answer to how George Reeves died will likely never be definitively known, 'Hollywoodland' provides a few possibilities which have been and will continue to be debated.",4,Superman.

The action flashes back several years to Reeves life as a gigilo to a wealthy wife of a prominent Hollywood fixer. He gets the starring role in the new tv series Superman.

646104,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005JP90,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","2006 was a year of duplicate movies. Two magician movies (The Illusionist & The Prestige), two war movies (Flags of Our Fathers & Letters for Iwo Jima), and two 1940-1950 Hollywood style films that centered around infamous unsolved murders. One is this film, ""Hollywoodland"" which is based on the death of TV's first Superman, George Reeves (Ben Affleck). The other is ""The Black Dahlia"" which is based on the unsolved murder of a young starlet. Being one of the only people who liked ""The Black Dahlia"" I still found that I agreed with most people that ""Hollywoodland"" is ultimately a better film. Both films have the same, glossy feel of that time in Hollywood (and I think, as far as style, ""The Black Dahlia"" is better) but when it comes to story, acting, dialogue, and meaning...""Hollywoodland"" wins. Unlike The Black Dahlia, ""Hollywoodland"" is based on a case that was ruled as a suicide. George Reeves, unable to attain work after Superman ended, walked upstairs during a small get together at his house and shot himself. This movie uses a fictional character named Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) to investigate the death, which doesn't seem to be as open-and-shut as the LAPD thinks. Indeed, if the movie has all the facts about the case right...It certainly doesn't look like a suicide. Simo is a private detective who spends his time chasing cheating wives and milking all the money he can for it. Then he's hired by Reeves' mother, who doesn't believe that her son would commit suicide. The movie is intercut with scenes from Reeves' life. An actor trying to make it in Hollywood, who began an affair with the Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the wife of the general manager of MGM Edgar Mannix (Bob Hoskins). Toni, an aging beauty, buys George a house and has him living like a star; he lands the role of Superman. The movie has a lot to say and not just about Reeves'. In one scene, after Reeves' has landed a role in ""From Here to Eternity"" he's at the premiere. When he appears onscreen the crowd begins whispering ""That's Superman"" before the audience erupts into laughter. Pretty soon, attempting to branch out on his own, George meets a younger woman named Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney, 'Prison Break') who he eventually proposes too. Reeves', much like the Dahlia, takes a backseat to the fictional main character Louis Simo, played with conviction and charm by Brody. There's a lot of things that this film has that makes it work; It never settles on a conclusion for Reeves' death, but merely presents us with a number of possibilities and leaves it up to us to decide. ""The Black Dahlia"" meanwhile had an idiotic, long rant about who the murderer was. The acting here is superb and all the actors seem to be completely comfortable reciting dialogue that sounds like it's from a '50s movie. In ""The Black Dahlia"" the dialogue was campy and the actors seemed uncomfortable reciting it. Also, the fictional character is a lot more likeable than in the other film. The biggest surprise in the film is Ben Affleck, a man I've never really thought of as an actor but more of a movie star. Here, he proves that he's got real acting chops. I've never seen any clips of the real George Reeves' but Affleck's performance is really good nonetheless. Equal praise to Diane Lane, who really eats up the scenery here. She truly seems like an actress from those days (except not as old, obviously). ""Hollywoodland"" is a little slice of Hollywood-glam that isn't campy or stupid and is actually a really good film. One of the most haunting scenes I've seen from a film in 2006 is when Reeves' dressed as Superman and entertaining a group of kids, has a young boy walk up to him carrying a real gun and asking if he can shoot him. This scene could've been turned into something of a soap opera, but here it just works. ""Hollywoodland"" is a terrific film, see it.GRADE: A-",5,"Not Perfect, But I Liked It A Lot",1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,3864,"['2006', 'was', 'year', 'duplicate', 'movies', 'Two', 'magician', 'movies', 'Illusionist', 'Prestige', 'two', 'war', 'movies', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'Letters', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'two', '1940-1950', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'films', 'centered', 'around', 'infamous', 'unsolved', 'murders', 'One', 'film', 'Hollywoodland', 'based', 'death', 'TV', 'first', 'Superman', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'other', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'based', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'young', 'starlet', 'Being', 'one', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'still', 'found', 'agreed', 'most', 'people', 'Hollywoodland', 'ultimately', 'better', 'film', 'films', 'have', 'same', 'glossy', 'feel', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'think', 'as', 'far', 'style', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'better', 'when', 'story', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'meaning', 'Hollywoodland', 'wins', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'Hollywoodland', 'based', 'case', 'was', 'ruled', 'suicide', 'George', 'Reeves', 'unable', 'attain', 'work', 'Superman', 'ended', 'walked', 'upstairs', 'small', 'get', 'together', 'house', 'shot', 'movie', 'fictional', 'character', 'named', 'Louis', 'Simo', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'investigate', 'death', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'open-and-shut', 'LAPD', 'thinks', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'facts', 'case', 'right', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'look', 'suicide', 'Simo', 'private', 'detective', 'who', 'time', 'chasing', 'cheating', 'wives', 'milking', 'money', 'can', 'Then', 'hired', 'Reeves', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'son', 'would', 'commit', 'suicide', 'movie', 'intercut', 'scenes', 'Reeves', 'life', 'actor', 'trying', 'make', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'began', 'affair', 'Toni', 'Mannix', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'wife', 'general', 'manager', 'MGM', 'Edgar', 'Mannix', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Toni', 'aging', 'beauty', 'George', 'house', 'living', 'star', 'role', 'Superman', 'movie', 'lot', 'say', 'not', 'just', 'Reeves', 'one', 'scene', 'Reeves', 'landed', 'role', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'premiere', 'When', 'crowd', 'whispering', 'Superman', 'audience', 'laughter', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'attempting', 'branch', 'out', 'own', 'George', 'younger', 'woman', 'named', 'Leonore', 'Lemmon', 'Robin', 'Tunney', ""'Prison"", 'Break', 'who', 'eventually', 'too', 'Reeves', 'much', 'Dahlia', 'backseat', 'fictional', 'main', 'character', 'Louis', 'Simo', 'played', 'conviction', 'charm', 'Brody', 'lot', 'things', 'film', 'work', 'never', 'conclusion', 'Reeves', 'death', 'merely', 'number', 'possibilities', 'up', 'decide', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'meanwhile', 'had', 'idiotic', 'long', 'rant', 'who', 'murderer', 'was', 'acting', 'here', 'superb', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'completely', 'comfortable', 'reciting', 'dialogue', ""'50s"", 'movie', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'dialogue', 'was', 'campy', 'actors', 'seemed', 'uncomfortable', 'reciting', 'Also', 'fictional', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'likeable', 'other', 'film', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'film', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'man', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'actor', 'more', 'movie', 'star', 'Here', 'got', 'real', 'acting', 'chops', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'clips', 'real', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Affleck', 'performance', 'really', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'Equal', 'praise', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'who', 'really', 'up', 'scenery', 'here', 'truly', 'actress', 'days', 'not', 'old', 'obviously', 'Hollywoodland', 'little', 'slice', 'Hollywood-glam', ""n't"", 'campy', 'stupid', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'One', 'most', 'haunting', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', '2006', 'when', 'Reeves', 'dressed', 'Superman', 'entertaining', 'group', 'kids', 'young', 'boy', 'walk', 'up', 'carrying', 'real', 'gun', 'asking', 'can', 'shoot', 'scene', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'turned', 'something', 'soap', 'opera', 'here', 'just', 'Hollywoodland', 'terrific', 'film', 'see', 'it.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

Or did he pull the trigger himself? Unfortunately ""Hollywoodland"" doesn't give us any good insight of what really happened.Story:""Hollywoodland"" deals with the mysterious death of George Reeves, the man who played Superman in a very popular TV show back in the 1950s. They found him death in his room. For the LAPD his death was suicide--apparently he shot himself. This official announcement is not good enough for the detective Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) who believes something different happened that fatal night. He investigates the incident, even though he has his own personal problems and assumptions.Review:""Hollywoodland"" tries to give the audience different scenarios of what really happened that night. We see flashbacks every now and then about Reeve's fading acting career, his love affair with Toni Mannix (Diane Lane) and Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney). Also Louis has personal flashbacks and nightmares of his own. There is a lot of speculation going on in the detective's mind. These flashbacks don't help the story because we cannot really tell if we are watching the past or one of Louis' dreams.The movie has excellent cinematography, but they could have used a better editor. It feels longer than it is due to the slow pace of the film. The other issue is the acting. Despite the excellent cast, the actors do not have much material to work with, especially Ben Affleck who is the lead actor. He delivers a dull and boring performance, unfortunately something he is known for. Toward the end of the movie we noticed that Louis and George have one thing in common, both were mediocre at their professions and desperately tried to make it big. Some of the dialogue was over the top, to the point of vulgarity.Not everything is lost in this film. Superman looks pretty charming on set. Also there are some dramatic scenes involving Louis' personal life, both as a detective and as a father.The Verdict:""Hollywoodland"" is a long, slow and depressed ""Oscar"" wannabe movie that shows us three different versions of what might have happened to the TV Superman.

646108,A2SNYQC0AVWZZV,B00005JP90,"J.T.J., an Author","[4, 4]","For me, the movie ""Hollywoodland"" is an attempt to sell the story of a very good actor, George Reeves, through the performance of a fairly average actor, Ben Affleck. I know, many have praised Ben for his deeply sensitive performance as the distraught George Reeves, and to an extent I sing similar praise. ""Hollywoodland,"" without question, is a very good film. The set design, costumes, period flavor, and script are above average.I shall add that the performances of Adrien Brody, Diane Lane and Bob Hoskins are outstanding. These actors bring these characters to life as if they were figures looking back at us from the pages of Los Angeles history. They carry the story along superbly.Then there is Ben Affleck. So much of ""Hollywoodland"" depends on an expert performance given by an actor playing the highly charismatic George Reeves. One must understand that there would not even be a movie about George Reeves if Reeves had simply been an ordinary personality. He was more than that. As a child growing up in the 1950s it was clear to me and virtually everyone else I knew that George Reeves was a bigger than life TV star who was so good in the role of Superman/Clark Kent, that it was inconceivable that anyone else could possibly fill his shoes in that role. It took until 1978 for that to happen when Christopher Reeve played the hero from Krypton in that great Superman movie.I mention all this about Reeves because I do not think that Affleck was able to communicate the charisma of George Reeves. Yes, he probably did an above average job in communicating the man's disappointment, frustration, and ambition, but that was not sufficient. There should have been more on the screen to communicate WHY WE SHOULD CARE. For example, what about the charity work Reeves did for children? How about his good natured personality, and fun-loving side that had been frequently reported by his co-stars, and Hollywood friends? Very little evidence of his ""brighter side"" was presented. One must understand that everyone was deeply shocked by his sudden death. His death at the time was more than one of those, ""Well, there goes another screwed up actor.""The concept of ""Why We Should Care"" harkens back to all great tragedies--and I think the writers and director of Hollywoodland were trying to show Reeves' death as a modern tragedy within an interesting cloud of mystery. The concept of tragedy primarily shows us someone who was great, or potentially great, who has unfortunately died abruptly and unable to fulfill promise and success. I think George Reeves qualified as a tragic figure, but Ben Affleck did not communicate such loss. The loss he communicated was something akin to the pathos. The movie exhibits a lot of ""gee,what a shame,"" and very little, ""No! This loss is terrible!!!""I might be measurably unfair to Affleck. Perhaps the director did not work with Ben Affleck adequately to illicit a better performance conveying the positive side of Reeves as well as the sad dimension. Ben is not bad in the film, I just don't think he's great. In fact, his acting seems inferior to that of the character he is playing, George Reeves. This is hugely problematic.In conclusion, I should note that in spite of my criticism, ""Hollywoodland"" is definitely a film worth seeing. It is a good dramatic story, albeit somewhat unsatisfying. I think the choice of another actor in the role of George Reeves would have been a better idea. Someone like Hugh Jackman, or a complete unknown,perhaps. Anyway, see the film, but keep in mind that George Reeves had a lot more charisma than Mr. Affleck should ever hope to possess.",3,Affleck and Reeves,1189641600,"09 13, 2007",2007,3627,"['movie', 'Hollywoodland', 'attempt', 'sell', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'George', 'Reeves', 'performance', 'fairly', 'average', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'know', 'many', 'have', 'praised', 'Ben', 'deeply', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'distraught', 'George', 'Reeves', 'extent', 'sing', 'similar', 'praise', 'Hollywoodland', 'question', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'set', 'design', 'costumes', 'period', 'flavor', 'script', 'are', 'shall', 'add', 'performances', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'are', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'were', 'figures', 'looking', 'back', 'pages', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'history', 'carry', 'story', 'superbly.Then', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'So', 'much', 'Hollywoodland', 'expert', 'performance', 'given', 'actor', 'playing', 'highly', 'charismatic', 'George', 'Reeves', 'One', 'must', 'understand', 'there', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'movie', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Reeves', 'had', 'simply', 'been', 'ordinary', 'personality', 'was', 'more', 'child', 'growing', 'up', '1950s', 'was', 'clear', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'else', 'knew', 'George', 'Reeves', 'was', 'bigger', 'life', 'TV', 'star', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'role', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'was', 'inconceivable', 'anyone', 'else', 'could', 'possibly', 'fill', 'shoes', 'role', 'took', '1978', 'happen', 'when', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'played', 'hero', 'Krypton', 'great', 'Superman', 'movie.I', 'mention', 'Reeves', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Affleck', 'was', 'able', 'communicate', 'charisma', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Yes', 'probably', 'did', 'above', 'average', 'job', 'communicating', 'man', 'disappointment', 'frustration', 'ambition', 'was', 'not', 'sufficient', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'screen', 'communicate', 'WHY', 'WE', 'SHOULD', 'CARE', 'example', 'what', 'charity', 'work', 'Reeves', 'did', 'children', 'How', 'good', 'natured', 'personality', 'fun-loving', 'side', 'had', 'been', 'frequently', 'reported', 'co-stars', 'Hollywood', 'friends', 'Very', 'little', 'evidence', 'brighter', 'side', 'was', 'presented', 'One', 'must', 'understand', 'everyone', 'was', 'deeply', 'shocked', 'sudden', 'death', 'death', 'time', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'Well', 'screwed', 'up', 'actor', 'concept', 'Why', 'Should', 'Care', 'back', 'great', 'tragedies', 'think', 'writers', 'director', 'Hollywoodland', 'were', 'trying', 'show', 'Reeves', 'death', 'modern', 'tragedy', 'interesting', 'cloud', 'mystery', 'concept', 'tragedy', 'primarily', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'great', 'potentially', 'great', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'died', 'abruptly', 'unable', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'success', 'think', 'George', 'Reeves', 'qualified', 'tragic', 'figure', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'did', 'not', 'communicate', 'such', 'loss', 'loss', 'communicated', 'was', 'something', 'akin', 'pathos', 'movie', 'lot', 'gee', 'what', 'shame', 'very', 'little', 'No', 'loss', 'terrible', 'might', 'be', 'measurably', 'unfair', 'Affleck', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'adequately', 'illicit', 'better', 'performance', 'conveying', 'positive', 'side', 'Reeves', 'as', 'well', 'sad', 'dimension', 'Ben', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'great', 'fact', 'acting', 'inferior', 'character', 'playing', 'George', 'Reeves', 'hugely', 'problematic.In', 'conclusion', 'should', 'note', 'spite', 'criticism', 'Hollywoodland', 'definitely', 'film', 'seeing', 'good', 'dramatic', 'story', 'somewhat', 'unsatisfying', 'think', 'choice', 'actor', 'role', 'George', 'Reeves', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'idea', 'Someone', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'complete', 'unknown', 'perhaps', 'Anyway', 'see', 'film', 'keep', 'mind', 'George', 'Reeves', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'charisma', 'Mr.', 'Affleck', 'should', 'ever', 'hope', 'possess']",N/A

In the ""S on the chest"" category, Reeves is my choice.  This movie depicts my generation's veneration for Reeves as Superman with a somewhat satirical arch, though the film is indeed better when it deals with that aspect of the Reeves story than with the love life and career struggle threads that dominate the Reeves plot.  (This is NOT, after all, really a movie about Reeves OR his death.)  On one occasion, the film's ""Ben Reeves"" does wink at his young adulators, too briefly hinting at the charisma and charm the real Reeves brought to the ""Georgian"" super hero.  A little more empathetic nostalgia to ballast the clay-footedness would've been appreciated, if Ben were up to it.The popularity of Ben Affleck has long been a mystery to me.  I'd heard that he gained weight for his role as George Reeves later in life, as a naked (possible) suicide.  That tiny onscreen paunch?  George should've been so lucky!  Over all, Affleck sweats out the same wooden monotone and doughy poker face that are his trademark.  But his performance is not the reason for such a low rating.  He could've been worse.The screenplay ""reads"" like a novel about a fictional detective who undergoes all the usual noir situations and--oh, by the way--coexists somewhat distantly with a famous real-life case.  BLUE DAHLIA, anyone?  It's more LAURA than an A&E; ""crimes expose"" reenactment. As such, it aspires to recreate the atmosphere of CHINATOWN and its sequel, at times effectively recreating the '50s noir aura but with few John Alton moments.The Reeves phenomenon and the mysterious death are what drew me into the theater, plus hearing some interviews with makers of the film.  The producers made interesting decisions, particularly salting the background not just with sparkling cars from the year being depicted but dusty autos of every vintage for a touch of authenticity.  The detective's sleezy motel is a pleasure as well, eerily matched in a 1971 David Janssen noir film called WARNING SHOT that I watched a couple of days later.But it's the Mickey Spillane misogyny that tanks the movie.  The women are coarse, voracious, and persistently unpleasant.  Their only interests are money, forcing their sexual upperhand, and foul language.  Lacking the style and mystique of, say, CHINATOWN's Mrs. Mulray or ANY of noir's genuine femme fatales (Trevor, Totter, Windsor) their trash-bound characterizations do in the picture.",2,"""O Swarmy"" Ben Wooden and Spillane  misogyny",1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,2523,"['generation', 'own', 'definition', 'certain', 'pop', 'cult', 'characters', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'Star', 'Trek', 'crew', 'Superman', 'S', 'chest', 'category', 'Reeves', 'choice', 'movie', 'generation', 'veneration', 'Reeves', 'Superman', 'somewhat', 'satirical', 'arch', 'film', 'indeed', 'better', 'when', 'aspect', 'Reeves', 'story', 'love', 'life', 'career', 'struggle', 'threads', 'dominate', 'Reeves', 'plot', 'NOT', 'really', 'movie', 'Reeves', 'OR', 'death', 'one', 'occasion', 'film', 'Ben', 'Reeves', 'wink', 'young', 'adulators', 'too', 'briefly', 'hinting', 'charisma', 'charm', 'real', 'Reeves', 'brought', 'Georgian', 'super', 'hero', 'little', 'more', 'empathetic', 'nostalgia', 'ballast', 'clay-footedness', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'appreciated', 'Ben', 'were', 'up', 'it.The', 'popularity', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'long', 'been', 'mystery', ""'d"", 'heard', 'gained', 'weight', 'role', 'George', 'Reeves', 'later', 'life', 'naked', 'possible', 'suicide', 'tiny', 'onscreen', 'paunch', 'George', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'lucky', 'Affleck', 'out', 'same', 'wooden', 'monotone', 'doughy', 'poker', 'face', 'are', 'trademark', 'performance', 'not', 'reason', 'low', 'rating', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'worse.The', 'screenplay', 'reads', 'novel', 'fictional', 'detective', 'who', 'usual', 'noir', 'situations', 'oh', 'way', 'somewhat', 'distantly', 'famous', 'real-life', 'case', 'BLUE', 'DAHLIA', 'anyone', 'more', 'LAURA', 'A', 'E', 'crimes', 'expose', 'reenactment', 'such', 'recreate', 'atmosphere', 'CHINATOWN', 'sequel', 'times', 'effectively', 'recreating', ""'50s"", 'noir', 'aura', 'few', 'John', 'Alton', 'Reeves', 'phenomenon', 'mysterious', 'death', 'are', 'what', 'drew', 'theater', 'hearing', 'interviews', 'makers', 'film', 'producers', 'made', 'interesting', 'decisions', 'particularly', 'salting', 'background', 'not', 'just', 'sparkling', 'cars', 'year', 'being', 'depicted', 'dusty', 'autos', 'vintage', 'touch', 'authenticity', 'detective', 'sleezy', 'motel', 'pleasure', 'as', 'well', 'eerily', 'matched', '1971', 'David', 'Janssen', 'noir', 'film', 'called', 'WARNING', 'SHOT', 'watched', 'couple', 'days', 'later.But', 'Mickey', 'Spillane', 'misogyny', 'movie', 'women', 'are', 'coarse', 'voracious', 'persistently', 'unpleasant', 'only', 'interests', 'are', 'money', 'forcing', 'sexual', 'upperhand', 'foul', 'language', 'Lacking', 'style', 'mystique', 'say', 'CHINATOWN', 'Mrs.', 'Mulray', 'ANY', 'noir', 'genuine', 'femme', 'fatales', 'Trevor', 'Totter', 'Windsor', 'trash-bound', 'characterizations', 'do', 'picture']",N/A
646110,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JP90,Kaya Savas,"[1, 2]","MOVIE: Real film noir hasn't been seen in awhile maybe since L.A Confidential. While Hollywoodland isn't quite 100% film noir, it shares elements of it and makes the story feel a little modern in a good way. You don't have the bad guys smoking fat cigars and wearing rimmed hats that shade their faces as a streetlight hangs over them, and that makes the film more accessable and believable. The film borrows a lot from the classic Polanski film, Chinatown. The story follows private investigator Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) as he tries to prick and prod at the suicide case of actor George Reeves (Ben Affleck). The film is told with parallel storylines; one of the storylines is the one with Simo investigating the case, while the other is of George Reeves and his rise to fame and unfortunate death. The film cuts back and forth seamlessly as if they were both happening at the same time, it really works well. By showing George Reeves' story we see all the friends and enemies he makes in Hollywood as he becomes more and more famous. That makes Simo's storyline easier to understand and makes it more interesting for us as he makes all of his different accusations. Simo believes that Reeves did not commit suicide, that he was murdered instead due to his status in Hollywood. As he learns more about Reeves so does the audience in the other storyline, and we start to throw things around in our minds as an audience. Did the studio executives murder him because he became a failure and started losing them tons of money? Was he murdered by one of his jealous lovers because of all the affairs he had? Was it merely an accident? Or was his life so miserable that he actually did commit suicide? The audience will have a great time trying to figure it out, and they will be pulled into the world of 1940's/1950's Hollywood. The only problem with the movie is that pacing and tone is a bit inconsistent. The movie speeds up and slows down way too much, and there is never a consisent tone. The film overall is fairly light despite its dark subject matter. The film does in fact end on a dark and disturbing note, but it doesn't match with the rest of the film. It's an amazing ending, but it just doesn't match tone-wise. The movie also owes a lot to it's fantastic directing from Allen Coulter who makes his feature film directing debut. Marcelo Zarvous was the film's composer, and he really hasn't done anything noteworthy before this. His score to the film felt like an incarnation of Jerry Goldsmith's score to Chinatown, but I liked it. It really created the right mood for the film's setting. Too bad it couldn't create a consistant tone.ACTING: The cast lays it down on the table and there are amazing performances all around. Adrien Brody is perfect as Simo, he carries himself the right way and talks the right way. His character is a bit sleazy, but we follow him anyway in his pursuit of the truth (or money?). As you've probably read in many other reviews, Ben Affleck was sensational as George Reeves. His body language, the way he talks, the way he carries himself all embody a man of the era. He adds complexity to the character who would seem very static in any other circumstance. He makes the conclusion of the case all the more doubtful because as an audience we see that it could be any one of the scenarios that the film presents us. Diane Lane is great as usual and gives her character presence as well, which is essential in relation to Affleck's character. Bob Hoskins pulls out his snotty L.A accent as the powerful studio executive who has his money do all his work. Imagine his character from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? only as a man of power instead of a gutter rat. Great acting all around in this one, truly pleased with the cast. A supporting nomination for Affleck? Not out of the question.BOTTOM LINE: We go deep into the realms of tinsletown and delve under the rocks for the truth. We experience all the guts and glamour of the land that is Hollywood. Hollywoodland may feel inconsistant and a little incomplete, but its great screenplay and amazing cast pull it up and make it a pretty darn good film.",4,"A Great Film With A Touch Of Noir For Flavor, Great Cast, Great Script, But The Tone Of The Film Is Inconsistant",1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,4137,"['MOVIE', 'Real', 'film', 'noir', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'awhile', 'maybe', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Hollywoodland', ""n't"", 'quite', '100', '%', 'film', 'noir', 'shares', 'elements', 'story', 'feel', 'little', 'modern', 'good', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'guys', 'smoking', 'fat', 'cigars', 'wearing', 'rimmed', 'hats', 'shade', 'streetlight', 'hangs', 'film', 'more', 'accessable', 'believable', 'film', 'lot', 'classic', 'Polanski', 'film', 'Chinatown', 'story', 'private', 'investigator', 'Louis', 'Simo', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'prick', 'prod', 'suicide', 'case', 'actor', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'film', 'told', 'parallel', 'storylines', 'one', 'storylines', 'one', 'Simo', 'investigating', 'case', 'other', 'George', 'Reeves', 'rise', 'fame', 'unfortunate', 'death', 'film', 'cuts', 'back', 'forth', 'seamlessly', 'were', 'happening', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'well', 'showing', 'George', 'Reeves', 'story', 'see', 'friends', 'enemies', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'more', 'famous', 'Simo', 'storyline', 'easier', 'understand', 'more', 'interesting', 'different', 'accusations', 'Simo', 'Reeves', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'suicide', 'was', 'murdered', 'instead', 'due', 'status', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'Reeves', 'so', 'audience', 'other', 'storyline', 'start', 'throw', 'things', 'minds', 'audience', 'studio', 'executives', 'murder', 'became', 'failure', 'started', 'losing', 'tons', 'money', 'Was', 'murdered', 'one', 'jealous', 'lovers', 'affairs', 'had', 'Was', 'merely', 'accident', 'was', 'life', 'so', 'miserable', 'actually', 'did', 'commit', 'suicide', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'pulled', 'world', ""1940's/1950"", 'Hollywood', 'only', 'problem', 'movie', 'pacing', 'tone', 'bit', 'inconsistent', 'movie', 'up', 'down', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'never', 'consisent', 'tone', 'film', 'overall', 'fairly', 'light', 'dark', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'fact', 'end', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'note', ""n't"", 'match', 'rest', 'film', 'amazing', 'ending', 'just', ""n't"", 'match', 'tone-wise', 'movie', 'also', 'lot', 'fantastic', 'directing', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'who', 'feature', 'film', 'directing', 'debut', 'Marcelo', 'Zarvous', 'was', 'film', 'composer', 'really', ""n't"", 'done', 'anything', 'noteworthy', 'score', 'film', 'felt', 'incarnation', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'score', 'Chinatown', 'liked', 'really', 'created', 'right', 'mood', 'film', 'setting', 'Too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'create', 'consistant', 'tone.ACTING', 'cast', 'down', 'table', 'are', 'amazing', 'performances', 'around', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'perfect', 'Simo', 'right', 'way', 'talks', 'right', 'way', 'character', 'bit', 'sleazy', 'follow', 'anyway', 'pursuit', 'truth', 'money', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'read', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'was', 'sensational', 'George', 'Reeves', 'body', 'language', 'way', 'way', 'embody', 'man', 'era', 'complexity', 'character', 'who', 'would', 'seem', 'very', 'static', 'other', 'circumstance', 'conclusion', 'case', 'more', 'doubtful', 'audience', 'see', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'scenarios', 'film', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'great', 'usual', 'character', 'presence', 'as', 'well', 'essential', 'relation', 'Affleck', 'character', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'out', 'snotty', 'L.A', 'accent', 'powerful', 'studio', 'executive', 'who', 'money', 'do', 'work', 'Imagine', 'character', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'only', 'man', 'power', 'instead', 'gutter', 'rat', 'Great', 'acting', 'around', 'one', 'truly', 'pleased', 'cast', 'supporting', 'nomination', 'Affleck', 'Not', 'question.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'go', 'deep', 'realms', 'tinsletown', 'delve', 'rocks', 'truth', 'experience', 'guts', 'glamour', 'land', 'Hollywood', 'Hollywoodland', 'may', 'feel', 'inconsistant', 'little', 'incomplete', 'great', 'screenplay', 'amazing', 'cast', 'pull', 'make', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'film']",N/A

Having watched it and read other reviews here I have come to one conclusion.The questionable death of George Reeves was given a finer moment than the horrendous murder of the Black Dahlia in the two recent films.My expectations of The Black Dahlia were dashed away early in the movie. But this movie is much better. The filming itself, costumes, sets and dialogue were done quite well.The acting is all stellar. Diane Lane again proves herself as a lasting force here. Adrian Brody does very well as the detective and Ben Affleck is suprisingly star quality as George Reeves. The understated Bob Hoskins is once again excellent.Drawn from true events, this film pulls a lot of peripheral events and tries to pull together pieces of the puzzle of Reeves suicide. Was it really murder? The film offers a few different thoughts on the idea and portrays them well enough to each be considered a possibility.What the film tried to do, which I feel it failed, was to show personal anguish of the detective investigating the death. All it really did was to distract. Personally I think those parts could have been deleted.What this movie did show was the sordid lives of the glamourous people of the 50's. The lies, coverups and affairs all exposed. It left out the duality of actors/acting, which I thought was good. After all, this was to focus on real life events.All in all this movie is definitely worth a look. It has more character and compelling story than others of it's kind. The acting, scripts, costumes and sets are all very well done.

646114,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JP90,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","There is a fantastic film within ""Hollywoodland""! That film stars Ben Affleck and Diane Lane, both giving superlative performances. As TV Superman George Reeves, Affleck connects with a role that some say mirror his own situation. He's an appealing, handsome actor of limited range who is not generally regarded for having actual talent. And Affleck steps up to the task of inhabiting that persona--he shows the frustration, rage, and longing for respect that comes with being typecast as Superman. Diane Lane plays the wife of a studio exec who fancies Reeves and turns him into her kept ""boy."" Well, an older woman never looked so good! Lane just seems to get better and better as the years go by. She hits all the right notes in a performance that's wickedly sexy, desperate, charming, and funny--all rolled up into one.This relationship, her open marriage to Bob Hoskins, his courtship with a golddigger played nicely by Robin Tunney, and the tale of Reeves' struggle in Hollywood--this is all grand entertainment. It's filmed and executed beautifully and is thoroughly fascinating.Sadly, there is also an average film within ""Hollywoodland."" That film stars Adrien Brody as a two-bit private detective hired to look into Reeves' apparent suicide. Might it have been more? In addition to the investigation, we get many other glimpses into Brody's life--his strained relationship with his wife and child, his affair with a younger woman, another case that goes terribly wrong, and some backstory about how he ended up on the outskirts of the Hollywood machine. It's all fine, but nothing nearly as intriguing as the Reeves case--and nothing particularly original, eitherSadly, the two aspects never merged cohesively for me. Every time you're drawn into something interesting in Reeves' life--BOOM, the film pulls you out to see some parallel with the detective. Well, ultimately, I just had to say ""who cares?"" to most of those moments. Brody's relationship with his son, for example, plays prominently. Not enough time is spent with these subplots to actually develop feelings one way or the other--they just serve to shut down the main action. Now I'm not blaming Brody--his performance is fine--all the performances are fine. It's the structure of the film. It just doesn't serve the story well--however talented everyone associated with this production may be.Part of the film was 5 stars, part was 3 stars. I'd rate the whole venture at about 3 1/2--with regret--because there is a film in here that I would have loved to see.

Down-on-his-luck private eye Louie Sima (Adrien Brody) is hired by Reeves' mother who thinks it was murder, even though the police have labeled it a suicide.  Louie's investigation alternates with flashbacks showing Reeves (Ben Affleck) from his early days as a struggling actor, his reluctant TV stardom, and his last days as a typecast has-been.  Among Louie's suspects are Reeves' mistress (Diane Lane), her studio boss husband (Bob Hoskins), and Reeve's finance.  Louie is determined to crack the case because he sees how much he and Reeves had in common:  They were both very unhappy, lonely men.Brody and Affleck give outstanding performances playing flawed but likeable underdogs.  Afflect is charming, suave, and likeable and Louie is the poor underdog who can't seem to get a break.  The lovely Diane Lane does a great job playing the older woman.  I think the real star, however, is director Allen Coulter who recreated the time period so lovingly and filmed with dim, atmospheric lighting that made it look and feel like an old Bogart movie.

646117,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00005JP90,Larry VanDeSande,"[6, 7]","This so-called ""fact-based"" melodrama about the death of ""Superman"" actor George Reeves had all the potential in Hollywood to become a blockbuster of monumental proportion. It took an event based on reality from the golden age of Hollywood studios (the action took place during 1959), it added authentic Hollywood scenery and location shooting, and it had a cast of masterful and beautiful stars (Adrien Brody and Ben Affleck as the male leads, Diane Lane, Bob Hoskins and wonderfully sinful Robin Tunney in support) blended in a Tinseltown mystery that had all the potential to be the first ""Chinatown"" of the new millennium. Instead, this movie was a flop and a bore. Why is that?First, a brief synopsis for those that haven't seen it. TV star George Reeves (Affleck) kills himself, the Los Angeles police declare it a suicide and close the case, Reeves' mother hires private investigator Brody to investigate the case, which she says is a murder, and his investigation leads to a story told in flashback and real time sequences. While at time atmospheric and involving, the storyline has bumps and cliches to overcome.Brody, probably the most talented actor now in Hollywood, recieves poor direction as the whimsically understated investigator Louis Simo, who just happens to be a divorced father living on the fringe of the P.I. fraternity. His characterization in this film is more cliche than living, breathing three-dimensional person, although he has effective mind sequences late in the film when he concludes, first, the Reeves was inadvertently killed by his lover and, second, that he was murdered and, third, that he did himself in.Of the remaining stars in the cast, only Hoskins has the potential to approach Brody as an actor. He has a one-dimensional role as a Hollywood big shot and cuckold husband to Lane, who plays Reeves lover and entree to the ""Superman"" role. Tunney, playing Reeves later lover and fiancee, was convincing in her bad girl role but also monochromatic, pointing out another shortcoming in this film -- unimaginative direction. These actors all did well with their parts as moveable cardboard cutouts while not one particularly distinguished themselves.Furthermore, the script and pace of the film did little to involve viewers. Instead of building a slow web of deceipt and corruption a al ""Chinatown"", this script meandered all over the place with far too many side trips. First it was as a mystery; second it was a portrayal of the cliched life of Brody's character; third it was a peek behind the scenes at the way things are done by Hollywood studios; fourth it was a murder msytery involving too many characters and too many subplots that took the viewer away from the main storyline. In one of Simo's subplots, illustrating a failure among many failures in his life, one of his other clients kills his wife, who he'd hired Simo to follow. This side trip -- which took up three scenes in the movie -- added nothing to this film and betrayed its raison d'etre.I don't know how long it's been since I saw a film that less met my lowered expectations than ""Hollywoodland"". I'd have to go all the way back to 1980 and ""The Formula"", where the worst editing in film history wasted the talents of George C. Scott, Marlon Brando and other great actors in another mystery about a timely issue of that day and ours -- the machinations of increasing gasoline prices. So chalk up ""Hollywoodland"" to the junk heap of films that had classic potential and instead became mediocrities.",3,Why wasn't this film better?,1193961600,"11 2, 2007",2007,3514,"['so-called', 'fact-based', 'melodrama', 'death', 'Superman', 'actor', 'George', 'Reeves', 'had', 'potential', 'Hollywood', 'become', 'blockbuster', 'monumental', 'proportion', 'took', 'event', 'based', 'reality', 'golden', 'age', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'action', 'took', 'place', '1959', 'added', 'authentic', 'Hollywood', 'scenery', 'location', 'shooting', 'had', 'cast', 'masterful', 'beautiful', 'stars', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'male', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'wonderfully', 'sinful', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'support', 'blended', 'Tinseltown', 'mystery', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'first', 'Chinatown', 'new', 'millennium', 'Instead', 'movie', 'was', 'flop', 'bore', 'Why', 'First', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'TV', 'star', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Affleck', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'police', 'declare', 'suicide', 'close', 'case', 'Reeves', 'mother', 'hires', 'private', 'investigator', 'Brody', 'investigate', 'case', 'murder', 'investigation', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'real', 'time', 'sequences', 'time', 'atmospheric', 'involving', 'storyline', 'bumps', 'cliches', 'overcome.Brody', 'probably', 'most', 'talented', 'actor', 'now', 'Hollywood', 'poor', 'direction', 'whimsically', 'understated', 'investigator', 'Louis', 'Simo', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'divorced', 'father', 'living', 'fringe', 'P.I', 'fraternity', 'characterization', 'film', 'more', 'cliche', 'living', 'breathing', 'three-dimensional', 'person', 'effective', 'mind', 'sequences', 'late', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'Reeves', 'was', 'inadvertently', 'killed', 'lover', 'second', 'was', 'murdered', 'third', 'did', 'in.Of', 'remaining', 'stars', 'cast', 'only', 'potential', 'approach', 'Brody', 'actor', 'one-dimensional', 'role', 'Hollywood', 'big', 'shot', 'cuckold', 'husband', 'Lane', 'who', 'Reeves', 'lover', 'entree', 'Superman', 'role', 'Tunney', 'playing', 'Reeves', 'later', 'lover', 'fiancee', 'was', 'convincing', 'bad', 'girl', 'role', 'also', 'monochromatic', 'pointing', 'out', 'shortcoming', 'film', 'unimaginative', 'direction', 'actors', 'did', 'well', 'parts', 'moveable', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'not', 'one', 'particularly', 'distinguished', 'themselves.Furthermore', 'script', 'pace', 'film', 'did', 'little', 'involve', 'viewers', 'Instead', 'building', 'slow', 'web', 'deceipt', 'corruption', 'al', 'Chinatown', 'script', 'meandered', 'place', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'side', 'trips', 'First', 'was', 'mystery', 'second', 'was', 'portrayal', 'cliched', 'life', 'Brody', 'character', 'third', 'was', 'peek', 'scenes', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'fourth', 'was', 'murder', 'msytery', 'involving', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'took', 'viewer', 'away', 'main', 'storyline', 'one', 'Simo', 'subplots', 'illustrating', 'failure', 'many', 'failures', 'life', 'one', 'other', 'clients', 'wife', 'who', ""'d"", 'hired', 'Simo', 'follow', 'side', 'trip', 'took', 'up', 'three', 'scenes', 'movie', 'added', 'nothing', 'film', 'betrayed', 'raison', ""d'etre.I"", 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'saw', 'film', 'less', 'met', 'lowered', 'expectations', 'Hollywoodland', ""'d"", 'have', 'go', 'way', 'back', '1980', 'Formula', 'where', 'worst', 'editing', 'film', 'history', 'wasted', 'talents', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'other', 'great', 'actors', 'mystery', 'timely', 'issue', 'day', 'ours', 'machinations', 'increasing', 'gasoline', 'prices', 'So', 'chalk', 'Hollywoodland', 'junk', 'heap', 'films', 'had', 'classic', 'potential', 'instead', 'became', 'mediocrities']",N/A

The plot and sub-plots make no sense and fall flat. Based on supposition and theory, this is an attempt to make George Reeves' death more spectacular than his boring life.

We see a frustrated George Reeves who tried to give an outward cheery demeanor to his adoring public (just about every kid in America) while being prevented from doing what he wants to do (star in mainstream films and direct).  Some of the problems were related to being typecast (we see the audience laughing at him when he appears in From Here to Eternity) though I believe if you are good you can get past that (they laughed at Cher at the premiere of Silkwood).  Other issues were related to having a controlling mistress who was married to a movie studio executive and she appears to use her influence to prevent George from doing anything outside the cape and tights.There is an interesting subplot as we see George hating the adoration of all kids, while the investigator of his murder Simos (Adrienne Brody) is clueless to have any meaningful relationship with his own kid.Simos tries so hard to unravel the ""mystery"" behind the night of Reeve's death and misses many obvious clues from another client that hired Simos to trail his suspected unfaithful wife.

His life seems to parallel that of Reeves', as he is hired by the dead actor's mother (Lois Smith) to investigate the case.During his travels, Brody uncovers the relationship between second-rate actor Reeves (Ben Affleck in a performance that deserved an Oscar nomination), and the much older Toni Mannix (Diane Lane).  He also encounters the power of the studios and their ability to arrange a cover-up of what really happened to Reeves.Bob Hoskins as Eddie Mannix, Robin Tunney as Reeves' fiance' and Joe Spano as MGM publicity head Howard Strickling are part of a fine cast that brings this compelling true story to life.DVD extras include deleted scenes, audio commentary by director Allen Coulter and three above-average ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes, which discuss old Hollywood and the actual Reeves case.

George Reeves is best-remembered for playing Superman in the popular television series ""The Adventures of Superman"", a role that stifled his career and increased Reeves' general discontent with life. Reeves' second claim to fame is his apparent suicide on June 16, 1959 -famous because some people believe he was murdered. In ""Hollywoodland"", private investigator Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) is hired by Reeves' mother Helen Bessolo (Lois Smith) to investigate that possibility. Elated that a high profile case has landed in his lap, Simo looks for motives in Reeves' relationship with longtime mistress Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), whose husband was MGM ""fixer"" Edgar Mannix (Bob Hoskins), and with girlfriend Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney), who was present the night of his death. The film flashes back to George Reeves' (Ben Affleck) life from the early 1950s until his death.""Hollywoodland"" is constructed like two films woven together, one of which works, while the other falters. Louis Simo is a fictional character inspired by the detectives from the Nick Harris Detective Agency, whom Reeves' mother did, in fact, hire to investigate her son's death. Simo is written to act as a mirror to Reeves as we watch his growing dissatisfaction with his career. Reeves had been a contract player under the old studio system, which was crumbling in the 1950s, leaving many actors struggling to find work just as public tastes were changing. Reeves was more successful than most actors but never achieved the type of success that he wanted -that of a classic movie star, and his career woes led to bouts of depression. Simo has dreams of being a famous private eye, almost like the ones in movies a decade before his time, and his ambitions have led him to squander all that was valuable in his life.Using some sort of narrative device as a window on Reeves' life is a good idea, but not this one. Louis Simo is somehow unreal, and it's not just that he's a poser. I found him lacking in emotional credibility. Perhaps the character feels too contrived. Or maybe the problem is casting. But Louis is uninteresting and unconvincing. On the other hand, Ben Affleck is wonderful as George Reeves. And Diane Lane brings so much complexity to Toni Mannix, a domineering women whose consciousness of her own fading beauty is affecting. Writer Paul Bernbaum wisely represents all three major theories about Reeves' death. Production designer Leslie McDonald has painstakingly recreated Hollywood of the 1950s in all of its glamour and grit. I recommend ""Hollywoodland"" to anyone interested in George Reeves or in Old Hollywood, but I'm afraid that others will think the Louis Simo story bogs the movie down. This is touchy material and a challenging structure for director Allen Coulter's feature film debut, and he got it half right. 3 1/2 stars.The DVD (Universal 2007): Bonus features include 3 featurettes, deleted scenes, and an audio commentary.

I loved the series.  Ben Affleck is terrific in this film.  I don't know what George Reeves was like off screen, but Affleck gave a great performance of a man with ups and downs, a man who loved life and made some bad decisions.  Bob Hoskins was absolutely fantastic in this movie playing the executive at MGM and then there was Diane Lane as his wife who has an affair with Affleck's Reeves character.  Diane Lane has to be one of the best actresses around these days and she gives a wonderful performance.  Now we come to Brody.  What was his character about?  We spent almost as much time exploring his character as we did Reeves.  I guess there were some parallels, but Brody was wasted in this film.  In fact, if you saw Sin City, imagine Adrian Brody playing Bruce willis' part there.  No don't it will make your brain hurt.  I could however see Willis in Brody's part as private investigator Simo.  Enough of that.  This was a good movie. 2 hours and 7 minutes long and it did not seem that long.  It jumped back and forth from past to present a lot but I did not find it hard to follow at all.  And the scene where a kid has what appears to be a real gun ready to shoot Superman.  That was a magic moment in film history.

Taking place in the golden age of Hollywood, Detective Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) probes the mysterious death of George Reeves (Ben Affleck), otherwise known as TV's Superman.  Originally ruled a suicide, Simo suspects something else, and with a growing number of suspects, including the wife (Diane Lane) of MGM boss Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins) whom Reeves was having an affair, and even more besides, things start to get even more complicated.  There's so much promise that is apparent throughout Hollywoodland, and the best parts are undoubtadly the flashback scenes involving Affleck and Lane, and yes, as advertised, Affleck is quite good and at the very least deserved an Oscar nomination.  The other part of the film is the detective/mystery story involving Brody, and while Brody is good as well, this is the part where the film suffers.  Director Allen Coulter, who has directed a number of episodes for various HBO series', seems uninspired with the film, with nothing that really sticks out.

(Reeves was the television actor who portrayed Superman in the 1950s television series.) According to what I know of the real-life story, the movie is fairly accurate in its depiction of events and relationships.Reeves (played well by Affleck) is a small-time actor looking for work. He meets and strikes up an affair with Toni Mannix (a beautiful and tragic Lane), wife of Ed Mannix (Hoskins), a VP at MGM. Toni turns George into her ""kept man,"" buying him a house, expensive gifts, etc. Reeves lands the part of Superman, but he takes it only because he wants some money of his own. (He feels that the series will never get picked up, and that no one will ever see it.) What he soon discovers, however, is that he has been pigeon-holed into the small-screen character, and that attempts to secure other work, particularly in film, are futile. A depressed Reeves eventually breaks it off with Mannix, taking up with Lenore Lemmon. Shortly thereafter, Reeves is discovered in his bedroom, dead from a gunshot wound to the head.Louis Simo (Brody) is an invented character, a private investigator hired by Reeves' estranged mother to look into his death. Simo is dealing with his own frustrations - separation from his wife, and ailing relationship with his son, problems with his mistress, moral justification for his line of work, and money trouble. Set against the backdrop of his query into the Reeves case, these issues sharpen and lead to a determination for him to discover what actually happened to a fellow ""Superman.""Performances were uniformly solid, with Affleck deftly capturing Reeves' descent into hopelessness. Lane is gorgeous and giddy as a woman who discovers a young lover, and harrowed and haunted as a woman spurned and bereaved (or guilty?). Hoskins does well, too, as the understanding (and potentially violent) husband in an open marriage. Brody is the true centerpiece of the film, however, drawing all of the material together and reflecting it back at the viewer through the lens of his current troubles.The feel of the film is authentic. I loved the sets, props, and costumes, with Lane in particular serving as a showcase for such. Production values were high on this film.What I enjoyed most about this movie, though, was that the ending was left ambiguous. The filmmakers do not give us an answer about how they think Reeves met his end. (Sifting through the details of Reeves' life, Simo imagines several different scenarios for the star's demise.) Rather, they let us see the myriad of possibilities, understanding that what happened on that June night in 1959 will most likely remain one of Hollywood's unsolved mysteries.",3,Super enough to hold your attention,1210377600,"05 10, 2008",2008,2855,"['Hollywoodland', 'nice', 'period', 'piece', 'interesting', 'performances', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Diane', 'Lane.Based', 'actual', 'events', 'movie', 'story', 'George', 'Reeves', 'death', 'Reeves', 'was', 'television', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Superman', '1950s', 'television', 'series', 'According', 'what', 'know', 'real-life', 'story', 'movie', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'events', 'relationships.Reeves', 'played', 'well', 'Affleck', 'small-time', 'actor', 'looking', 'work', 'up', 'affair', 'Toni', 'Mannix', 'beautiful', 'tragic', 'Lane', 'wife', 'Ed', 'Mannix', 'Hoskins', 'VP', 'MGM', 'Toni', 'George', 'kept', 'man', 'buying', 'house', 'expensive', 'gifts', 'etc', 'Reeves', 'part', 'Superman', 'only', 'money', 'own', 'series', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'What', 'soon', 'discovers', 'however', 'been', 'pigeon-holed', 'small-screen', 'character', 'attempts', 'secure', 'other', 'work', 'particularly', 'film', 'are', 'futile', 'depressed', 'Reeves', 'eventually', 'off', 'Mannix', 'taking', 'up', 'Lenore', 'Lemmon', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'Reeves', 'discovered', 'bedroom', 'dead', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'head.Louis', 'Simo', 'Brody', 'invented', 'character', 'private', 'investigator', 'hired', 'Reeves', 'estranged', 'mother', 'look', 'death', 'Simo', 'dealing', 'own', 'frustrations', 'separation', 'wife', 'ailing', 'relationship', 'son', 'problems', 'mistress', 'moral', 'justification', 'line', 'work', 'money', 'trouble', 'Set', 'backdrop', 'query', 'Reeves', 'case', 'issues', 'sharpen', 'lead', 'determination', 'discover', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'fellow', 'Superman', 'Performances', 'were', 'uniformly', 'solid', 'Affleck', 'deftly', 'capturing', 'Reeves', 'descent', 'hopelessness', 'Lane', 'gorgeous', 'giddy', 'woman', 'who', 'young', 'lover', 'harrowed', 'haunted', 'woman', 'spurned', 'bereaved', 'guilty', 'well', 'too', 'understanding', 'potentially', 'violent', 'husband', 'open', 'marriage', 'Brody', 'true', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'however', 'drawing', 'material', 'together', 'reflecting', 'back', 'viewer', 'lens', 'current', 'troubles.The', 'feel', 'film', 'authentic', 'loved', 'sets', 'props', 'costumes', 'Lane', 'particular', 'serving', 'showcase', 'such', 'Production', 'values', 'were', 'high', 'film.What', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'movie', 'though', 'was', 'ending', 'was', 'left', 'ambiguous', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'answer', 'how', 'think', 'Reeves', 'met', 'end', 'Sifting', 'details', 'Reeves', 'life', 'Simo', 'several', 'different', 'scenarios', 'star', 'demise', 'Rather', 'let', 'see', 'myriad', 'possibilities', 'understanding', 'what', 'happened', 'June', 'night', '1959', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'remain', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'unsolved', 'mysteries']",N/A

646139,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B00005JP90,Phil S.,"[2, 3]","Adrien Brody does a great job as the ""blue collar"" Detective trying to make it in Hollywood; Ben Affleck is equally great as Mr. George Reeves, the successful TV actor trying to make it as a serious film star in Hollywood. The 1959 trappings are beautifully portrayed through expert cinematography.I found the film to be about 10 minutes too long, and too heavy on the flashbacks; also, Simo's sidekick, a female with all the perceptiveness of her business associate but with all the career restrictions expecyed in 1959, really is not necessary to the story and whose part should have been edited.There is much anachronistic dialogue and direction: the whispering dialogue thing belongs to todays' sitcoms and soap operas.Film/Television historians correct me if I'm wrong, but the scene which Reeves burns his costume because the show's been cancelled doesn't ring true, considering the information in a TV Special a while ago which said that the show went on hiatus in '58 to return in '59.Another bothersome bit is where Mrs. Mannix refers to (presumeably) Phyllis Coates in a then-derogatory way with regard to orientation.

As a kid who was parked in front of the TV every day with my older brother watching each episode of ""Superman"" over and over again, I was crushed later when I learned that George Reeves committed suicide.  This broke the bubble of fantasy for the character and the actor and broke the hearts of many children like me.  When I later read the book that described the probable real scenario of his death, ""death by one woman too many, and the wrong women,"" it was easier to accept.  Tragic and pitiful it was, for an actor of much promise that I had also viewed in Metrocolor as the Tarleton twins in ""Gone With The Wind.""  I, of course, had to view this movie, ""Hollywoodland"" to try to come to some kind of closure for George Reeves.  I was not disappointed by the movie as it captured the nostalgic atmosphere of Hollywood at the time and Adrien Brody as PI Louis Simo is the standout in this production.

One can feel nothing but sadness for participants of this co-dependent tribe.  We have handsome, talented actor who is torturned about being reduced to a cartoon character in tights.  In spite of him being humorous about this situation, he is deeply troubled about being typecast.  Then we have rich Hollywood mogul's wife who becomes too demanding and clingy at the point that she makes her lover a kept man.  Social climber, young opportunist with hopes of comfortable life and face pretty enough to demand it, finds out that man she imagines to be rich has no money and no prospects of making something out of himself after his Superman career is over. In her disappointment she becomes cruel and uncaring, but still unwilling to leave him.  When mysterious death occurs and actor dies from a gun wound, the question comes up if this is a murder or suicide since all of these characters to some extent have motive to rid of him in order to numb their own misery.

646146,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JP90,RMurray847,"[5, 5]","I've seen , as a child, one or two ancient reruns of the SUPERMAN TV series starring George Reeves.  Even in the late `60s, this show looked cheap and uninteresting.  Yet for a couple of seasons, it made hunky actor Reeves famous through the nation.  It also resulted in typecasting that prevented him from getting any other roles and eventually led him down a path of heavy drinking and other destructive behavior...culminating in his suicide.  Simple enough.But HOLLYWOODLAND informed me that Reeves' death, though ruled a suicide, might actually have been a murder.  And what we see with this movie is the investigation into the life and death of Reeves.  A private detective, Louis Simo (well-played by Adrien Brody), who is looking for his own ""Big Break"" takes on the challenge and is met with resistance on all sides...the police, the film industry and by those closest to Reeves.  Are they hiding something, or are they simply clinging to some privacy.  Naturally, our thoughts are skewed towards believing Reeves was murdered.  After all, the movie couldn't possibly take us back to where started, could it?  That Reeves simply committed suicide.But the thing about HOLLYWOODLAND is that it isn't really about this mystery.  It's about the ravages of an unreasonable quest for glory...about the failings of always wanting more.  It isn't simply another clich&eacute;d film about gaining fame and the disappointment of losing it.  It examines how our own unreasonable goals can lead us down a path of self-destruction...making our goals that much harder to achieve.We see, through flashbacks, the later career of Reeves (Ben Affleck).  He had a small part in 1939's GONE WITH THE WIND...and now, in the late `50s...he's never achieved anything like it again.  He does meet and fall into a passionate affair with rich society lady Toni Mannix (Diane Lane) who takes him under her wing.  He becomes something of a kept man...but he's okay with that because he believes she can help his career.  She is married to a studio chief, after all.  A chief who doesn't mind their affair because he has his own mistresses.  The couple are genuinely fond of each other, and for awhile, things go well.  But when SUPERMAN comes along, Reeves is literally trapped behind his caped costume.  His show is so wildly successful that he cannot convince in anything else.  (Chances are, the way Affleck plays Reeves, he may not have been a very good actor either.) As his career stalls, Reeves becomes more and more frustrated.  He leaves his love for a younger woman...and thus sets up a series of motives for who may have killed him.What works so well about the film is that we see this ""star"" on a destructive path...paralleled by the path of the detective, who is also wracked by guilt, drinking and anguish over a failed marriage and a troubled son.  He's driven to prove himself as something of a ""star PI""...something he may simply not have the skills for.  Will his life take a path similar to Reeves.The film isn't saying, ""don't reach of the stars, you may get burned.""  But it does say, behind all the gloss, bad language and period detail...""take a moment to be grateful for what you DO have.""  This is a pretty nice message, and a surprising one to find in a gritty and icy film like this.As with many period films, everyone feels just a little trapped in the past.  We are held at an emotional remove from the actions...yet Affleck, Lane and Brody are good enough to pull us in.  Lane continues to dazzle as the ""go to"" actress of a certain age.  Her age is a crucial part of the film, and she is glamorous, yet also quite aware that her beauty is on the edge of fading.  Affleck is a revelation, much as his directing was with GONE BABY GONE.  As he did in venues such as SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, he plays his square-jawed good looks for fun, and is happy to let his full features run just a little bit to fat.  He's always handsome...but he finds a sadness and an anxiety that makes him seedy as well.  He's got a quick wit...but it only partially masks his anger and disappointment.  Brody gives another mannered performance...he's ideal for these period films because he is just slightly larger than life, like a stage actor making an uncomfortable transition to film.  He makes it work for him in HOLLYWOODLAND.Jeffrey DeMunn and Bob Hoskins also give good performances in smaller roles.  Robin Tunney, in her role as Reeves fianc&eacute;, is less convincing because she finds only the unlikeable side of her character.The very end of the film is a little disappointing.  I don't mean the result of the investigation...but literally the final scene with Brody.  I would have liked to see it go just 15 seconds longer...to reassure me that what I thought he was doing really was what he was doing.It's an adult film.  The themes will only be fully understood by people who've lived with disappointment and letdown.  It has a leisurely pace...but it is telling a pretty interesting story, both the mystery and human investigation.

646147,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JP90,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Hollywoodland (Allen Coulter, 2006)TV director Coulter takes his first whack at the big screen here and comes up kind of short. Not terribly short, mind you-- this isn't the awe-inspiring flop The Black Dahlia was-- but it could have been a great deal more than it is.Louis Simo (The Pianist's Adrien Brody) is a private detective who gets a tip from his ex-partner on the police force that perhaps the death of George Reeves (Ben Affleck) was not the easy suicide reported by a notoriously lazy coroner. The story is told in two timelines, as Simo delves into Reeves' life, which we then see. The problem is, there are folks who don't want Simo looking too closely at George Reeves' death, of course.Coulter had a high-powered cast assembled for him, and they play together well. There is no fault to be found with any of the acting here; all the principals and most of the supporting cast do jobs that range from competent to fantastic. Brody, especially, is a notoriously inconsistent actor (come on, The Pianist and The Singing Detective in the same year, even?), but he shines here. That's to be expected from supporting-cast folks like Bob Hoskins, Molly Parker, Diane Lane, Jeffrey DeMunn, Robin Tunney, Dash Mihok... you get the idea. You could've shot a legion of indies for the casting budget alone here, and the flmmakers got their money's worth-- on that score, at least.The script, on the other hand, could probably have used some retooling (or it got retooling it shouldn't have; the result is the same). There's an interesting parallel to be made between the lives of Reeves and Simo, but the way in which it's made is basic, dry-as-dust textbook stuff, and it almost seems as if the script itself isn't sure of how far it wants to take that comparison. Add to that the fact that, well, Coulter is a TV director. What works well on television does not always work well on the big screen. Lots of directors try this movie and make missteps with it; nothing against Coulter, who is in fact a fine TV director (among others, he's worked on Millennium, Rome, and The Sopranos). Hopefully he learns a few quick lessons from this experience and comes back with something stronger next time.. ** ",3,"Not bad, but not great.",1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,2204,"['Hollywoodland', 'Allen', 'Coulter', '2006', 'TV', 'director', 'Coulter', 'first', 'whack', 'big', 'screen', 'here', 'up', 'kind', 'short', 'Not', 'terribly', 'short', 'mind', ""n't"", 'awe-inspiring', 'flop', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'was', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'Simo', 'Pianist', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'private', 'detective', 'who', 'tip', 'ex-partner', 'police', 'force', 'perhaps', 'death', 'George', 'Reeves', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'suicide', 'reported', 'notoriously', 'lazy', 'coroner', 'story', 'told', 'two', 'timelines', 'Simo', 'Reeves', 'life', 'then', 'see', 'problem', 'are', 'folks', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Simo', 'looking', 'too', 'closely', 'George', 'Reeves', 'death', 'course.Coulter', 'had', 'high-powered', 'cast', 'assembled', 'play', 'together', 'well', 'fault', 'be', 'found', 'acting', 'here', 'principals', 'most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', 'jobs', 'range', 'competent', 'fantastic', 'Brody', 'especially', 'notoriously', 'inconsistent', 'actor', 'come', 'Pianist', 'Singing', 'Detective', 'same', 'year', 'even', 'here', 'be', 'expected', 'supporting-cast', 'folks', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Jeffrey', 'DeMunn', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'Dash', 'Mihok', 'get', 'idea', 'could', ""'ve"", 'shot', 'legion', 'indies', 'casting', 'budget', 'alone', 'here', 'flmmakers', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'score', 'least.The', 'script', 'other', 'hand', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'used', 'retooling', 'got', 'retooling', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'result', 'same', 'interesting', 'parallel', 'be', 'made', 'lives', 'Reeves', 'Simo', 'way', 'made', 'basic', 'dry-as-dust', 'textbook', 'stuff', 'almost', 'script', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'far', 'take', 'comparison', 'Add', 'fact', 'well', 'Coulter', 'TV', 'director', 'What', 'well', 'television', 'not', 'always', 'work', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'Lots', 'directors', 'try', 'movie', 'make', 'missteps', 'nothing', 'Coulter', 'who', 'fact', 'fine', 'TV', 'director', 'others', 'worked', 'Millennium', 'Rome', 'Sopranos', 'Hopefully', 'few', 'quick', 'lessons', 'experience', 'back', 'something', 'stronger', 'next', 'time..', '**']",N/A
646148,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JP90,Robert Moore,"[7, 7]","As a small child I remember the shock I experienced learning that the man who had played Superman had died by his own hand.  I learned this when the show was in reruns so I can only imagine how traumatic it was for kids who learned it firsthand.  Like many American children my early imagination was driven by a variety of caped heroes--Superman, Mighty Mouse, Underdog, Batman, and Robin--and I spent a fair amount of my preschool days with a towel pinned around my neck.  So this movie dealt with the other side of something that was very important to me as a child.Still, I think the group rating of three and a half stars for this film is about right.  It is extremely well acted--including, surprisingly, Ben Affleck--and is fascinating to look at with the meticulous recreations of the fifties (a look I remember vividly thanks to my grandparents' frozen-in-time decor, with the contemporary color television strangely at odds with everything else in the house).  Yet, it disappoints.  The story is a can't-miss one and yet they come astonishingly close to missing.The problem is that the movie has to pursue a point of view that really has little merit.  Though some of Reeve's friends discounted the conclusion that he had committed suicide--for instance, I remember reading legendary tough man Gene LeBell (if they had had ultimate fighting in his day, LeBell might well have dominated the sport) recount the plans Reeves was making for a cowboy show on television at the time of his death--most have concluded upon examination of the facts that Reeves did indeed commit suicide.  This is the conclusion the movie reaches as well, but it dances around this until the end, making the viewer think for most of its length that there might be a conspiracy of some sort.  There is, but not the conspiracy one anticipates.  But the film's biggest problem by far is content and pacing.  Too little happens in the movie and what does happen takes place too slowly.  The intrinsic fascination of Reeves's real life story kept me interested, but the way the whole tale was told dulled that interest.Still, there is no questioning that the film has a first-rate cast.  Affleck is better than he has ever been as Reeves.  He manages to communicate both charm and vulnerability as Superman's alter ego.  Diane Lane was her usual superb self as Reeves's older lover Toni Mannix, while Bob Hoskins's is also his usual superb self as film executive Eddie Mannix.  For the record, though an important industry figure, Mannix was not quite the power figure he is represented as being.  I would refer anyone so interested to any book providing a history of MGM.  He was, at best, an important second tier figure.  He served the power figures at MGM; he was not a power figure himself.  But narratively it was important to puff him up to be more significant than he was in real life.  It is true, however, that some linked him to the death of Jean Harlow's husband (who died under exceedingly shady circumstances).  I always enjoy watching Adrien Brody but it was somewhat dispiriting watching him pursue his mystery wrapped an enigma that turned out to be not so terribly mysterious at all.  I loved French-Canadian actress Caroline Dhavernas in the TV cult favorite WONDERFALLS, but I found her all but recognizable in the film as Brody's blonde (she is a natural brunette) girlfriend.This is one of those that is difficult to recommend yet hard to discourage one from seeing.  I'm certainly glad that I saw it even while acknowledging that they didn't do as good a job as they might have.  Summing up I suppose I could say that I found the investigation of Reeves's suicide/possible murder rather uninteresting and uninspiring, while I thoroughly enjoyed the scenes that were flashbacks to Reeves's life and career.  It makes me wonder if the film might not have been more interesting and successful as a straightforward biopic.  In the end it was his life and truly sad death that drives the film, not the investigation of a possible conspiracy.",3,A decent job of covering of the great real mysteries of Hollywood,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,4038,"['small', 'child', 'remember', 'shock', 'experienced', 'learning', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'Superman', 'had', 'died', 'own', 'hand', 'learned', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'reruns', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'traumatic', 'was', 'kids', 'who', 'learned', 'firsthand', 'many', 'American', 'children', 'early', 'imagination', 'was', 'driven', 'variety', 'caped', 'heroes', 'Superman', 'Mighty', 'Mouse', 'Underdog', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'spent', 'fair', 'amount', 'preschool', 'days', 'towel', 'pinned', 'neck', 'So', 'movie', 'dealt', 'other', 'side', 'something', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'child.Still', 'think', 'group', 'rating', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'film', 'about', 'right', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'including', 'surprisingly', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'fascinating', 'look', 'meticulous', 'recreations', 'fifties', 'look', 'remember', 'vividly', 'thanks', 'grandparents', 'frozen-in-time', 'decor', 'contemporary', 'color', 'television', 'strangely', 'odds', 'everything', 'else', 'house', 'story', ""can't-miss"", 'one', 'yet', 'come', 'astonishingly', 'close', 'missing.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'pursue', 'point', 'view', 'really', 'little', 'merit', 'Reeve', 'friends', 'discounted', 'conclusion', 'had', 'committed', 'suicide', 'instance', 'remember', 'reading', 'legendary', 'tough', 'man', 'Gene', 'LeBell', 'had', 'had', 'ultimate', 'fighting', 'day', 'LeBell', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'dominated', 'sport', 'recount', 'plans', 'Reeves', 'was', 'making', 'cowboy', 'show', 'television', 'time', 'death', 'most', 'have', 'concluded', 'examination', 'facts', 'did', 'indeed', 'commit', 'suicide', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'making', 'viewer', 'think', 'most', 'length', 'might', 'be', 'conspiracy', 'sort', 'not', 'conspiracy', 'one', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'far', 'content', 'pacing', 'Too', 'little', 'happens', 'movie', 'what', 'happen', 'place', 'too', 'slowly', 'intrinsic', 'fascination', 'Reeves', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'kept', 'interested', 'way', 'whole', 'tale', 'was', 'told', 'dulled', 'interest.Still', 'questioning', 'film', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'Affleck', 'better', 'ever', 'been', 'Reeves', 'communicate', 'charm', 'vulnerability', 'Superman', 'alter', 'ego', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'was', 'usual', 'superb', 'self', 'Reeves', 'older', 'lover', 'Toni', 'Mannix', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'also', 'usual', 'superb', 'self', 'film', 'executive', 'Eddie', 'Mannix', 'record', 'important', 'industry', 'figure', 'Mannix', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'power', 'figure', 'represented', 'being', 'would', 'refer', 'anyone', 'so', 'interested', 'book', 'providing', 'history', 'MGM', 'was', 'best', 'important', 'second', 'tier', 'figure', 'served', 'power', 'figures', 'MGM', 'was', 'not', 'power', 'figure', 'narratively', 'was', 'important', 'puff', 'up', 'be', 'more', 'significant', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'true', 'however', 'linked', 'death', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'husband', 'who', 'died', 'exceedingly', 'shady', 'circumstances', 'always', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'was', 'somewhat', 'dispiriting', 'watching', 'pursue', 'mystery', 'wrapped', 'enigma', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'terribly', 'mysterious', 'loved', 'French-Canadian', 'actress', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'TV', 'cult', 'favorite', 'WONDERFALLS', 'found', 'recognizable', 'film', 'Brody', 'blonde', 'natural', 'brunette', 'girlfriend.This', 'one', 'difficult', 'recommend', 'yet', 'hard', 'discourage', 'one', 'seeing', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'glad', 'saw', 'even', 'acknowledging', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'might', 'have', 'Summing', 'up', 'suppose', 'could', 'say', 'found', 'investigation', 'Reeves', 'suicide/possible', 'murder', 'rather', 'uninteresting', 'uninspiring', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'were', 'flashbacks', 'Reeves', 'life', 'career', 'wonder', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'successful', 'straightforward', 'biopic', 'end', 'was', 'life', 'truly', 'sad', 'death', 'film', 'not', 'investigation', 'possible', 'conspiracy']",N/A
646149,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B00005JP90,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[0, 0]","Hollywoodland, the 2006 movie that purports to tell the story of the death of George Reeves, TV's original Superman, is a film with a broad reach, but a short grasp, leaping little in a single bound, and landing with a resounding thud.  The movie suffers from several fundamental flaws.The first, and most glaring, is star Ben Affleck.  In spite of an obviously earnest effort, the fact, extremely ironic in the face of the decisions to cast unknown actors Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain and Brandon Routh as the Supermen of the modern era, is that Affleck is too well known as Affleck to carry off the portrayal of Reeves.  Because the general American audience never saw enough of the real Reeves to have a mental picture of him as anything but Clark Kent and Superman, Affleck has little to grab onto, no quirks, traits or even distinguishing physical characteristics that would differentiate actor from character.  Appearing only four times as Superman and but once as Kent, Affleck is left playing a pretty boy thespian who could have been just about anyone; the audience simply never sees Reeves on screen.A second failing of the movie is its attempt to tell a pile of stories at once.  Interwoven here are the stories of Reeves' death, of the official investigation of that event, of Reeves' overall career, his career as Superman, how the latter impacted the former, and the dark tale of his strange and sad private life.  For expository reasons, all this is told thorough yet another story, that of the fictional private investigator who makes a self-serving stab at uncovering the truth behind the actor's demise.  Rather than adding texture and depth, all this detail proves a leaden weight that keeps the film decidedly earthbound.There were certainly enough oddities surrounding Reeves' actual death to give a modern viewer, weaned on CSI portrayals of meticulous police procedure, ample room for speculation.  Unaccounted for bruises on the body, evidence of several shots having been fired, the 45 minute lag before Reeves' guests, partying downstairs while he died, called the police, and the conflicting accounts of Reeves' state of mind, all suggested that there was more there then ever met the eye.  While the sloppy and cursory police work may have simply been an era standard, the movie simply hints that dark forces were at work and never gives a satisfactory rationale for either the implied rush to judgment or the final official conclusion.  In the end, the film just has no real answers to give, and simply leaves the viewer with the same conjectures common lore has posited for fifty years.Perhaps most jarring, however, is central the portrayal of Reeves in his iconic role. While at least four key facts, generally unknown but readily available, are portrayed with dead on accuracy, the movie strays from all acknowledged accounts to give us a Reeves who not only despises the character he plays, but disrespects him as well.  The fact is that Reeves was specifically selected to replace Kirk Alyn, the Superman of the 40s movie serials, because the producers wanted a more solid and manly characterization of both Clark Kent and Superman.  Alyn was a former dancer who pranced and posed as the Man of Steel, and offered a goofy, golly-gee Kent.  Both of Reeves' portrayals, by contrast, were no nonsense, take charge guys, particularly in the film noir atmosphere of the first season.  Affleck's portrayal of both, however, is taken straight from Alyn's interpretation, and leaves nothing recognizable of Reeves.  Particularly off key is Affleck's rubber suited Superman.  While it is true that Reeves wore a foam muscle suit under his familiar costume (a fact that Alyn made well known in several envy laden subsequent interviews), that padding was never apparent to either child or adult viewers.  Affleck's rubber suit, however, bulges and constricts like something right out of a Saturday Night Live skit, begging to be seen to accentuate the parody.  Combined with the artificially jutting jaw and theatrical poses, the effect is camp more worthy of Adam West's Batman or Bob Holiday's stage Superman that anything the contentious Reeves ever did.Also disturbing is the portrayal of Reeves, slouched and lounging, and slugging from a hip flask, moments before appearing live in front of an adoring audience of kids.  Reeves may have resented the impact Superman had on his career.  He may have felt typecast and frustrated by the fact that the Man of Steel overwhelmed the visions he had of himself as a Hollywood leading man.  But the fact is that he was also keenly, painfully, aware that he was carrying an icon on his shoulders.  Indeed, many of the indignities (and, as the movie chillingly shows, dangers) he faced were a direct result of his never letting Superman appear as anything but SUPERman.  Affleck's character, by contrast, could have phoned in his performance, and quite frankly, could not have cared less.There is no question but that Reeves was a flawed and troubled individual.  There is little question that he probably would have liked to have been more of a ""legitimate"" star as Hollywood interpreted the role in the fifties.  But in this film's attempt to get at the man behind the costume, an attempt which is disingenuously portrayed as NOT a biopic, little satisfying is delivered.  No new light is cast on Reeves' death, his darker side is shown almost exclusively, and the ""hero"" is shown as unquestionably having had feet of clay.  With so little accomplished, the viewer must ask, what was the point?",3,Feet of Clay,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,5565,"['Hollywoodland', '2006', 'movie', 'tell', 'story', 'death', 'George',

646150,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JP90,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","***1/2""Hollywoodland"" views the life and death of actor George Reeves through the lens of a film noir prism.  Unfortunately, when all is said and done, it is this rather contrived and artificial approach that proves to be the one serious weakness in this otherwise intriguing and thought-provoking film.When Reeves - who achieved pop icon status playing Superman on TV - was found dead of a gunshot wound in 1959, the police ruled the death a suicide and quickly closed the case.  However, after a certain amount of time (considerably longer than the movie implies, actually), rumors began to circulate that Reeves might have been the victim of foul play.  To that end, writer Paul Bernbaum and neophyte director Allen Coulter have decided to focus on the small-time detective (here named Louis Simo, though his name in real life was Milo Speriglio), who becomes obsessed with not only investigating the case but using it as a means of enhancing his career and making a name for himself in the process.In concocting their tale, the filmmakers have zeroed in on several of the more plausible scenarios that have taken root over the years (they have left out the silliest, the one claiming that Reeves got drunk one night, believed he really WAS Superman, and jumped off a building to prove the point).  According to the film, Reeves might have been murdered by either his young girlfriend at the time, the older woman who served as his ""sugar mama"" through most of the 1950's, or her big time movie producer husband who didn't like seeing his wife made miserable by Reeves' dumping her for another woman (how's that for spousal loyalty?).  As none of these theories has ever been proven even remotely true, however, we're left to file all this under the category of ""rank speculation"" and leave it at that.Fairly evenly divided between scenes set in the past and scenes set in the ""present,"" the film is at its best when concentrating on the career and personal travails of Reeves, and at its weakest when focusing on the investigation by Simo, which is often plodding, undramatic and loaded down with crime thriller cliches.  Brody delivers his usual sturdy performance in the part of Simo, but even he isn't able to bring most of the investigatory scenes to life.The scenes built around Reeves, on the other hand, achieve a genuine poignancy and sadness as we watch a man's professional aspirations wither before his very eyes.  For even though he achieved household-name status by donning the instantly recognizable blue suit and red cape, Reeves became so typecast in the role that his lifelong dream of becoming a serious movie actor died with his fame.  A virtual prisoner of both the part that came to define him and the wealthy older woman who ""kept"" him throughout this period, Reeves may well have seen no other alternative but suicide to end his misery.The two most poignant scenes in the film - one where Reeves is reduced to performing a live Superman show for an audience of kiddies and one at the ""From Here to Eternity"" premiere where his appearance on screen elicits derisive catcalls from many in the audience - involve a juicy insider's view of Tinsel Town values and life.It's safe to say that the writer intends for us to draw a parallel between Reeves and Simo, seeing as both are men unsuccessful in their chosen professions and desperately trying to prove they can play with the big boys in the major leagues.  Unfortunately, the Simo side of the equation is so hackneyed and conventional that the connection between the two men is largely lost on the audience.After a long series of dull performances in largely forgettable roles, Ben Affleck returns to the fine acting he displayed in such worthy movies as ""Boiler Room"" and ""Changing Lanes.""  As Reeves, he brings such a soul-searing sadness to the character he is playing that we know we will never be able to look at Reeves in quite the same way again.  But it is the extraordinary Diane Lane, as the wealthy socialite who takes the struggling actor under her wings, who delivers the most finely-tuned performance in the film.  Her combination of genuine love and calculated manipulativeness makes Toni Mannix, in many ways, the single most riveting character in the movie.  Lois Smith is also very good as Reeves' grief-stricken mother.For all its weaknesses, ""Hollywoodland"" is worth seeing not only for its excellent performances and for its pitch-perfect recreation of the Los Angeles of the 1950's, but for its strangely subdued look into the heart of one man's tragedy.",3,uneven but often intriguing film,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,4553,"['***1/2', 'Hollywoodland', 'life', 'death', 'actor', 'George', 'Reeves', 'lens', 'film', 'noir', 'prism', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'rather', 'contrived', 'artificial', 'approach', 'be', 'one', 'serious', 'weakness', 'otherwise', 'intriguing', 'thought-provoking', 'film.When', 'Reeves', 'who', 'achieved', 'pop', 'icon', 'status', 'playing', 'Superman', 'TV', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'gunshot', 'wound', '1959', 'police', 'ruled', 'death', 'suicide', 'quickly', 'closed', 'case', 'However', 'certain', 'amount', 'time', 'considerably', 'longer', 'movie', 'implies', 'actually', 'rumors', 'began', 'circulate', 'Reeves', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'victim', 'foul', 'play', 'end', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Bernbaum', 'neophyte', 'director', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'have', 'decided', 'focus', 'small-time', 'detective', 'here', 'named', 'Louis', 'Simo', 'name', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'Milo', 'Speriglio', 'who', 'obsessed', 'not', 'only', 'investigating', 'case', 'using', 'means', 'enhancing', 'career', 'making', 'name', 'process.In', 'concocting', 'tale', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'zeroed', 'several', 'more', 'plausible', 'scenarios', 'have', 'taken', 'root', 'years', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'silliest', 'one', 'claiming', 'got', 'drunk', 'one', 'night', 'believed', 'really', 'WAS', 'Superman', 'jumped', 'off', 'building', 'prove', 'point', 'According', 'film', 'Reeves', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'young', 'girlfriend', 'time', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'served', 'sugar', 'mama', 'most', '1950', 'big', 'time', 'movie', 'producer', 'husband', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'wife', 'made', 'miserable', 'Reeves', 'dumping', 'woman', 'how', 'spousal', 'loyalty', 'none', 'theories', 'ever', 'been', 'proven', 'even', 'remotely', 'true', 'however', ""'re"", 'left', 'file', 'category', 'rank', 'speculation', 'leave', 'that.Fairly', 'evenly', 'divided', 'scenes', 'set', 'past', 'scenes', 'set', 'present', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'concentrating', 'career', 'personal', 'travails', 'Reeves', 'weakest', 'when', 'focusing', 'investigation', 'Simo', 'often', 'plodding', 'undramatic', 'loaded', 'down', 'crime', 'thriller', 'cliches', 'Brody', 'usual', 'sturdy', 'performance', 'part', 'Simo', 'even', ""n't"", 'able', 'bring', 'most', 'investigatory', 'scenes', 'life.The', 'scenes', 'built', 'Reeves', 'other', 'hand', 'achieve', 'genuine', 'poignancy', 'sadness', 'watch', 'man', 'professional', 'aspirations', 'wither', 'very', 'eyes', 'even', 'achieved', 'household-name', 'status', 'donning', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'blue', 'suit', 'red', 'cape', 'Reeves', 'became', 'so', 'typecast', 'role', 'lifelong', 'dream', 'becoming', 'serious', 'movie', 'actor', 'died', 'fame', 'virtual', 'prisoner', 'part', 'came', 'define', 'wealthy', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'kept', 'period', 'Reeves', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'alternative', 'suicide', 'end', 'misery.The', 'two', 'most', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'film', 'one', 'where', 'Reeves', 'reduced', 'performing', 'live', 'Superman', 'show', 'audience', 'kiddies', 'one', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'premiere', 'where', 'appearance', 'screen', 'elicits', 'derisive', 'catcalls', 'many', 'audience', 'involve', 'juicy', 'insider', 'view', 'Tinsel', 'Town', 'values', 'life.It', 'safe', 'say', 'writer', 'draw', 'parallel', 'Reeves', 'Simo', 'seeing', 'are', 'men', 'unsuccessful', 'chosen', 'professions', 'desperately', 'trying', 'prove', 'can', 'play', 'big', 'boys', 'major', 'leagues', 'Unfortunately', 'Simo', 'side', 'equation', 'so', 'hackneyed', 'conventional', 'connection', 'two', 'men', 'largely', 'lost', 'audience.After', 'long', 'series', 'dull', 'performances', 'largely', 'forgettable', 'roles', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'fine', 'acting', 'displayed', 'such', 'worthy', 'movies', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'Changing', 'Lanes', 'Reeves', 'soul-searing', 'sadness', 'character', 'playing', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'look', 'Reeves', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'extraordinary', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'wealthy', 'socialite', 'who', 'struggling', 'actor', 'wings', 'who', 'most', 'finely-tuned', 'performance', 'film', 'combination', 'genuine', 'love', 'calculated', 'manipulativeness', 'Toni', 'Mannix', 'many', 'ways', 'single', 'most', 'riveting', 'character', 'movie', 'Lois', 'Smith', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Reeves', 'grief-stricken', 'mother.For', 'weaknesses', 'Hollywoodland', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'only', 'excellent', 'performances', 'pitch-perfect', 'recreation', 'Los', 'Angeles', '1950', 'strangely', 'subdued', 'look', 'heart', 'one', 'man', 'tragedy']",N/A
646151,A2UR0J92JAR2TW,B00005JP90,"Roman Martel ""R. Martel""","[1, 3]","The death of George Reeves has remained a mystery that has intrigued people since it occurred in 1959.  The trailers showed suggested a film that would explore the events surrounding his death, and a possible solution to the mystery.  The trailers were wrong.Visually the film captures the feel of Hollywood in the 50's.  Everything from the clothes, cars and even slang and mannerisms feels authentic.  The music and sound also play a big part in the film, making it feel solidly in that decade.With a cast like this its hard to fault any acting.  Adrien Brody carries the film, playing private investigator Simo, as a man who's life is sliding downhill, and unable (or unwilling) to do much about it.  You are intrigued by his character who is both repelling and compelling.  Diane Lane and Bob Hoskins provide great supporting roles.  They seem to be real people in a world where entertainment and illusions are common.  The big surprise is Ben Affleck.  He plays George Reeves as a man who's life is sliding downhill, and is unable or unwilling to do much about it.  His acting is believable, and even though he doesn't really look like Reeves, he captures his mannerisms and speech patterns.That link between Simo and Reeves is the key to the film.  The script and direction make it obvious that this is not a film about the mystery of Reeve's death.  Its about two men who are on the same path.  For Reeves the path ended with his death.  Simo's life is headed the same way.  The interesting part of this drama is seeing if he will do something about it.At first I was dissapointed by the film.  I felt that the mystery portion of the film was not handled well, bogging down the investigation with slow character development for Simo (who I assumed was a secondary character).  Once I realized what the movie was really about, I admired it more.  This is a period drama, examining human lives and the way they deal with the world they've made.  The mystery of Reeves' death is an element of the story, but not the crux of it.  If you go in knowing this, you'll find yourself enjoying a well acted and executed film.",4,A story of two lives spiraling out of control.,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,2121,"['death', 'George', 'Reeves', 'remained', 'mystery', 'intrigued', 'people', 'occurred', '1959', 'trailers', 'showed', 'suggested', 'film', 'would', 'explore', 'events', 'surrounding', 'death', 'possible', 'solution', 'mystery', 'trailers', 'were', 'wrong.Visually', 'film', 'feel', 'Hollywood', '50', 'Everything', 'clothes', 'cars', 'even', 'slang', 'mannerisms', 'feels', 'authentic', 'music', 'sound', 'also', 'play', 'big', 'part', 'film', 'making', 'feel', 'solidly', 'cast', 'hard', 'fault', 'acting', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'film', 'playing', 'private', 'investigator', 'Simo', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'sliding', 'downhill', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'do', 'much', 'are', 'intrigued', 'character', 'who', 'repelling', 'compelling', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'provide', 'great', 'supporting', 'roles', 'seem', 'be', 'real', 'people', 'world', 'where', 'entertainment', 'illusions', 'are', 'common', 'big', 'surprise', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'George', 'Reeves', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'sliding', 'downhill', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'do', 'much', 'acting', 'believable', 'even', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'Reeves', 'mannerisms', 'speech', 'patterns.That', 'link', 'Simo', 'Reeves', 'key', 'film', 'script', 'direction', 'make', 'obvious', 'not', 'film', 'mystery', 'Reeve', 'death', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'same', 'path', 'Reeves', 'path', 'ended', 'death', 'Simo', 'life', 'headed', 'same', 'way', 'interesting', 'part', 'drama', 'seeing', 'will', 'do', 'something', 'it.At', 'first', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'film', 'felt', 'mystery', 'portion', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'handled', 'well', 'bogging', 'down', 'investigation', 'slow', 'character', 'development', 'Simo', 'who', 'assumed', 'was', 'secondary', 'character', 'Once', 'realized', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'admired', 'more', 'period', 'drama', 'examining', 'human', 'lives', 'way', 'deal', 'world', ""'ve"", 'made', 'mystery', 'Reeves', 'death', 'element', 'story', 'not', 'crux', 'go', 'knowing', ""'ll"", 'find', 'enjoying', 'well', 'acted', 'executed', 'film']",N/A

The screenplay was poor to begin with but the film editing left it so choppy and disorganized that it was hard to determine what was going on.  There is no background,motivation,or connection, the characters simply appear and disappear.  The casting made sure that all of the actors and actresses looked alike so it was hard to distinguish who was who.  The film starts with a group of people who are never really identified as to who they are or why they are there.  This is a problem that persists throughout the film.  The actors do the best they can but they have very little to work with.  The connections between the various people are left to the viewer to sort out and some of them never did make any sense.  Brody does his best but the character Simo is really the only central theme and in an attempt to give the film direction and some sort of continuity and plot, Simo takes on several subplots that only serve to distract further from the film and what apparently was the central plot.I gave the film two stars because it does offer three logical theories regarding Reeves death, without actually endorsing any of them.  I thought the touch of gray hair at the very end made a huge statement and lent a silent credibility to the suicide alternative.

646153,A387BD735MI50R,B00005JP90,R. Schultz,"[2, 3]","Ben Affleck doesn't quite strike the right note in his portrayal of George Reeves here. Whenever the real Reeves would make public appearances in the 1950's, outside of his strict role as Superman, he seemed to have a glint of humor and intelligence and general liveliness about him. Affleck on the other hand plays the role in a sodden, sullen, almost stupefied state. In trying to show Reeves' dissatisfaction at being stereotyped as Superman, Affleck comes off as being not so much intransigent - as completely transfixed. The intention was probably to show Reeves walking to his doom. But that monotone doesn't do Reeves justice.Adrien Brody on the other hand is unexpectedly good and multi-dimensional as the private eye who investigates Reeves' death. He manages to be simultaneously cocky in-your-face, and at a philosophical remove. In a way, he reminds me a little of the narrator Nick in ""The Great Gatsby."" He comments in sad reflection on what seemed for all the world like a charmed life.In the DVD bonus materials, the Director points out the pains he took to make every detail in the movie authentically 1950's. He even arranged to have the cars going by on the street outside Reeves' windows all properly vintage cars - even if they could barely be glimpsed on the screen.I don't know if supplying that degree of detail was a good use of money, especially while some major points of logic in the narrative were neglected. For example, I still don't really understand what motivates the terrible beating Brody takes.However, this film is affecting. It has a lost, longing, nostalgic quality about it.

646154,AOL6BG6SAFGQF,B00005JP90,Rufus Quail,"[3, 4]","The best thing about this movie is its recreation of 1950s Hollywood. Since the '50s were my boyhood years, I'm a sucker for the vintage cars, decor, and clothing. Hollywoodland has clever nostalgic touches that will be lost on younger viewers. As the movie opens, we visit the apartment of poached private eye Louis Simo (Adrien Brody). The scene is a cool Mid-Century Modern apartment building. In the background is an overly tanned septuagenarian pumping iron in a Speedo. The ""barbell man"" (Eric Kaldor) shows up again later. Why is this amusing? The nation was in the midst of a bodybuilding craze. The Vic Tanny chain of health clubs (progenitor of modern fitness clubs) hit their peak of popularity in the late '50s.Other than that the movie is a mess. Dependable stars like Bob Hoskins, Diane Lane, and Adrien Brody seem to sleepwalk through their roles. The standout is Robin Tunney as Superman's feisty fiancee. Where did they find her? I can only guess that the others were victims of some organic flaw created by the filmmakers. Maybe they were conflicted about what kind of movie they thought they were making. A George Reeves biopic will be too boring, so let's spice it up with the noir gumshoe treatment.Poor Diane Lane. She almost never makes a wrong move. Her character, Toni Mannix, is portrayed as way older than Superman. Actually, Toni Mannix was just eight years older than George Reeves. There was no need to have Diane Lane ""play older."" They did her a terrible disservice. The last thing we need is a haggard Diane Lane. In an interview, Diane says the role was ""liberating."" Ohh-K.Affleck sings! We get to see Ben Affleck strum the guitar and sing a few howlworthy bars. I don't know if this is true to life, but it makes you start to think it's the real reason George Reeves killed himself.How did Ben Affleck ever become an actor? He pretty much ruins everything he's in.* He doesn't ruin Hollywoodland, however. The filmmakers took care of that. Affleck is best in the scenes involving kids. Maybe Affleck likes kids. After he rockets to fame as Superman, Reeves is stunned to see a crowd of kids watching him through the plate glass window of the restaurant he's visiting. The Diane Lane character tells him to put out his cigarette. In real life, George Reeves supposedly took it upon himself to never be seen smoking when kids were around. The other scene is when Superman has a personal appearance at a kiddieland. A disturbed-looking boy wants to shoot Superman with a real gun, just to see the bullets bounce off. Affleck's look of terror is convincing.Where did they find these kids? The one who wants to shoot Superman is very freaky. The boy who plays Adrien Brody's son has the most amazing ears. The boy is despondent when Superman kills himself. In the film, there's an epidemic of kiddie angst over Superman's death. I was around twelve at the time, but I don't recall anything about it. I was too busy being a kid to pay attention to current events.Hollywoodland mixes up actual events. When Superman gets a role in From Here to Eternity (1953), the incident is depicted as much later in his career and his last desperate chance to break free from the Superman shackles. His part is cut from the picture when a preview audience giggles at Reeves's scene. Actually, Reeves had other chances to ditch superman before his death in 1959. His uncredited role in ""Eternity"" was NOT cut. Affleck does a good job showing Superman's humiliation.Because the movie dwells so much on the grim story of Adrien Brody's character, the more interesting story of George Reeves is slighted. That would have been the better movie. I kept waiting for someone to slice Adrien Brody's nose. Instead, he got whipped with a heavy chain that looks like a prop from the Superman set. If the filmmakers were trying for another Chinatown they missed the mark by a flying leap.Nonetheless, the film is reasonably entertaining (3 stars). Some movies are helped by the availability of free DVDs from the library. Had I paid to see Hollywoodland, I might have felt robbed.* Dreadful movies can be fun.

646155,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JP90,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 4]","""Hollywoodland"" is a surprise, a smart, snazzy film noir that opens a week before ""The Black Dahlia,"" the long-awaited Brian DePalma/James Ellroy offering in the same genre. If that movie's the entr&eacute;e, here's a great appetizer of PIs, lust, movies and bullets. It's dark, baby.  I loved it.It reopens the suicide case of George Reeves, star of the ""Adventures of Superman,"" who supposedly killed himself in 1959 at 41 with a Luger to the head. Played effectively by Ben Affleck, Reeves is a vaguely charming, weathered meathead with a decent TV career and a studio executive's wife (Diane Lane) as his sugar momma.""It's a life he should have been happy with,"" his agent tells private detective Louis Simo (Adrien Brody). Reeves' mother believes he was happy, which is why she hires Simo to determine whether the actor was murdered. Writer Paul Bernbaum and director Allen Coulter (""The Sopranos"") seamlessly weave Simo's investigation with scenes from the actor's last decade on Earth.Reeves meets Toni Mannix, wife of MGM Studios Chief Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins). Older, connected, Toni gives Reeves a line on acting jobs. He gives her a stud to pamper. Toni helps land the ""Superman"" gig - a pit stop, Reeves hopes, because the show's a joke.Trouble is, kids love it. Reeves is typecast; when he acts in ""From Here To Eternity,"" it's Superman standing next to Montgomery Clift. ""Superman"" is finally canceled, Reeves is relieved. He signs a deal to direct. And, crucially, he leaves Toni for a smart-mouthed moll named Leonore (Robin Tunney, excellent). The scene in which Reeves dumps Mannix is a glorious, vile stream of words that can't be taken back.Without violence, anyway.Simo investigates while trying to manage the press, the mother, an ex-wife, a jealous client, a mistress and a couple low-life rivals. It's the classic, beleaguered PI, and Brody shoulders the role with wit and intelligence. Simo is smart, but not wise, and as he shambles into the dark corners of Reeves' life, a lot of kidney punches await him.Bernbaum's written a great script of quote-worthy dialogue for every character but one: Reeves. And that's on purpose, for Reeves is the straight man of a singular motive - movie stardom - living in a Hollywood of crooked aims. Affleck has hacked around in a lot of junk, but he sure can play Reeves, a smooth, self-pitying beef jaw of random parlor talents, winning smiles and childish anger. Affleck nails this it he hasn't since a cameo in ""Boiler Room.""Lane vamps delightedly as the predatory, carnal - yet sweet - Toni Mannix, who gets what she wants, even if Eddie gets it for her. And I think Hoskins has stopped acting. The camera rolls, the director yells ""do Hoskins,"" and you have the performance. The remaining cast, in small, purposeful roles, is uniformly good.""Hollywoodland"" more or less answers the mystery of Reeves' death in its final scenes. The actor's entire sordid life provides the motive. But who needs total closure when two hours go by so fast?  Affleck aside, this movie won't get any awards chatter, but it's a sweet lullaby to old, crooked, ravenous Hollywood.

However, if anything, I prefer ""The Black Dahlia,"" which although preposterous in the end, at least contains some exciting sequences and more authentic film noir atmosphere.""Hollywoodland"" starts off slow and then sort of fizzles out altogether. The film collapses under its own weight of dull mystery. Sure, film noirs often had convoluted plots, but they also had witty dialogue, plenty of atmosphere and action, and some kind of final resolution. ""Hollywoodland"" has none of this.There are lots of sequences in ""Hollywoodland"" with Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) standing inside or outside the late Reeves' house, smoking a cigarette and replaying Reeves' death each with a different perpetrator. Yet, no one is fingered for Reeves's death in the end, which I guess is the point of the film - that Reeves's death cannot be solved. But then why bother making the movie? Indeed, Simo does no investigating, and people contact him for the most part and he just tries to point reporters in the right direction. There is no real action in the movie, and Brody is a terrible choice to play a tough investigator: scrawny build and flat personality. However, I did think Ben Affleck did an adequate job as George Reeves, and Diane Lane was excellent as his mistress.""Hollywoodland"" and ""Black Dahlia"" both show that Hollywood doesn't know how to make a good film noir nowadays. Both movies try to attach moral lessons to their stories: Hollywood destroys people (like Liz Short in ""Black Dahlia""), and trying to become a star only ruins your personal life (like Reeves and Simo in ""Hollywoodland"").

This movie follows the trail of private investigator Louis Simo (a composite character played by Adrien Brody) who investigates whether George Reeves (the original actor who portrayed Superman on TV, played by Ben Affleck) committed suicide or not.The movie interweaves Simo's investigation with flashbacks to Reeves' past up until the day of Reeves' death (officially ruled a suicide by a gunshot wound in 1959).  Besides suicide, Simo reveals other possible scenarios for Reeves' death (at age 45).  Thus this movie can be classified as a drama, mystery, and history.The acting is terrific.  Brody and surprisingly Affleck give excellent performances.  (Besides these two performances, look for the fine performances of Diane Lane and Bob Hoskins who play a powerful but unhappily married movie couple.)This movie does a good job in recreating old Hollywood.  That is, the cinematography, the set design, costumes, make-up, lighting, period music, and overall tone of this movie are consistent in keeping with the old Hollywood of the 1950s.I only had two problems with this movie.  First, I feel that it spends too much time with the fictional private investigator Louis Simo.  I would have liked to have seen more of George Reeves.  Second, after giving us what I feel is a wonderful story, the movie just ends.  In other words, I was disappointed with the conclusion.Finally, the DVD is perfect in picture and sound quality.

646163,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005JP90,Steven Reynolds,"[2, 2]","In 1959, actor George Reeves, who had a small role in ""Gone With The Wind"" but was mainly famous for playing TV's Superman, was found dead, an apparent suicide. In this fictionalized retelling, low-rent private eye Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), convinces the actor's mother to launch a press-driven investigation into her son's death. Among the suspects are Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), Reeves' mistress and the wife of the powerful Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), a senior executive at MGM, and Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney) a possibly gold-digging fiancee... Director Allen Coulter has a good deal of fun exploring alternate theories of Reeves' death and at the same time delving into some unsavoury aspects of Old Hollywood. But the film's focus seems misplaced. The story of Reeves' rise and fall is a potentially moving one. Reeves was a talented, good-looking actor whose success as Superman was undercut by a feeling of ridiculousness, on top of the fact that he was supported by an older mistress, the wife of a top MGM executive. At age 45, there was every possibility he was washed up for good. Real poignancy might have been wrung from his predicament had the story been allowed to dwell there. What gets in the way is first-time scripter Paul Bernbaum's framing story involving Simo's investigation. It's far less intriguing than the melancholy tale of a limited actor reaching the end of the line during a transitional period in Hollywood. It doesn't help that Brody's Simo is a distinctly unlikeable protagonist and his investigation isn't really used to drive the narrative. The film's strengths lie in the unstated assumptions and emotional undercurrents developed among Reeves, Toni and, to a lesser extent, Eddie Mannix, along with its subtle portrait of a Hollywood still dominated by big studio grayhairs but in the midst of a major overhaul to youth and TV. It's great to see depictions of real-life characters such as Eddie Mannix and Joe Spano, MGM's powerful head publicist. They lend conviction and spark to an otherwise plodding film. Affleck won the Best Actor award at Venice for his portrayal of Reeves.

The movie does a really good job capturing the 50's style while also making los angeles look exactly like it's straight from the past. Anyways, not very many people know who George Reeves was because his life ended way too soon at the age of 45 but he was famous for being the second actor to play as Superman on film for the Adventures of Superman which was a huge hit for kids back in the day as all kids would rush home to watch George Reeves put on his Superman costume and became faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive! Now the movie does a tremendous job by casting Ben Afleck to play as George Reeves via Superman character and to be honest when I first read that Ben Afleck was playing as Superman, I wasn't too excited due to the laughable yet horrible movie where he played as DareDevil back in 2003 which was a pretty awful film. However, all of that was forgiven after I saw Ben Afleck amazingly surprised me as playing George Reeves Superman actor. Also, Adrien Brody was the perfect cast to play as a divorced father of 1 who was washed up and a struggling private investigator. Don't expect a crazy Michael Bay over the top film because you will not find that here but what you will find is a very well done movie with a good lineup of actors/actresses as well. The movie pretty much let's the viewer decide what they think happen to George Reeves mysterious death by cluing us in on three possible ways on how George Reeves mysterious death. I don't want to spoil anymore details because I honestly just think you should just watch this movie and I am very surprised that I ended up buying this movie because I never thought I would. This film also lines up with other Los Angeles crime movies like LA Confidential, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, ChinaTown, Mulholland Falls, etc just to name a few. Anyways, if you happen to be somewhat sick at home or a rainy day or just up late at night, then check out this flick with whatever your drinking and just relax while watching this film.

646167,A5TZXWU8AALIC,B00005JP90,The JuRK,"[1, 1]","There are things to like in HOLLYWOODLAND, a noir-ish detective that digs into the questionable ""suicide"" of George Reeves, TV's Superman in the 1950's.But there are also things I didn't like.

He chew gum, ask questions and take a punch as much as he likes...but he's no Bogart or Mitchum or...anybody else who's played this part.

646168,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00005JP90,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 2]","George Reeves played one of Scarlett O'Hara's suitors in the first scene of ""Gone With the Wind.""  It was his first movie role and the beginning of what should have been a successful career.  But Reeves' big break came twelve years later as a double-edged sword.  In 1951, he was cast to play the title character in ""The Adventures of Superman,"" a TV kids' show based on the comic book hero.  Reeves finally achieved the fame he coveted, but at a cost.  He was so closely identified with the Man of Steel that other acting work became elusive.  In 1959, newspaper headlines reported that Reeves had committed suicide.""Hollywoodland"" combines the story of Reeves (Ben Affleck) with that of down-and-out L.A. private eye Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), who attempts to attract media attention to himself by suggesting that the actor's death was a result of murder.  Simo is divorced and has a young son (Zach Mills) who is troubled by the death of his TV hero.  Simo operates from a cheap motel room and hustling has become a way of life he's not very proud of.Director Allen Coulter switches back and forth between the stories of Reeves and Simo, giving background on the private life of the actor, his affair with the wife (Diane Lane) of a powerful studio executive, his role as a kept boy toy, and his growing dissatisfaction with his career.As Simo delves into the ""suicide"" of Reeves more carefully than the police, he makes odd discoveries that raise difficult questions.  Why is Reeves' mother (Lois Smith) convinced that her son's death was not a suicide?  If Reeves shot himself, why were three bullet holes found, one from the exit wound to his head and two in the floor?  Why have the police been so quick to call Reeves' death a suicide when there are so many odd circumstances surrounding it?Simo is a man possessed as he devotes most of his working day to chasing leads, dropping hints to reporters, corralling and questioning people who were at Reeves' house the night he died, and arrogantly insinuating himself into the investigation that results in the reopening of the case.As the film progresses, we are shown three scenarios -- all imagined by Simo, armed with assorted information he has accumulated -- of what happened in Reeves' home the night he died.  According to the facts of the case, the credibility (or lack of it) of participants, and the power that the film studios wielded in Los Angeles, each of the three scenarios is reasonable.  Coulter never presumes to present one version as accurate.  He lays out the possibilities and lets the viewer put the pieces in place.""Hollywoodland"" combines elements of film noir with a traditional murder mystery.  It is made with great style and care.  The cast is uniformly first-rate.  Affleck, who has taken it on the chin from critics and moviegoers alike for such debacles as ""Gigli"" and ""Surviving Christmas,"" is excellent as Reeves, particularly in the early scenes, which portray the actor as a charming, handsome playboy able to enchant a woman with a smile and a witty remark.  Affleck conveys an easy self-assurance and suaveness that alter later as his character deteriorates.  Reeves enjoys the material goods being a kept man provides but yearns to become a star in the league of Clark Cable, not a guy in tights bashing through papier mache walls on TV.Eddie Mannix, a top M-G-M executive known for sweeping embarrassing facts under the carpet if they threaten to create bad publicity for the studio or its stars, is played by Bob Hoskins as a bulldog of a thug in a dinner jacket.  His speech clearly suggests tough beginnings.  He has had to look the role of studio executive while drawing on his questionable contacts and methods to hush up gossip before careers are destroyed.  Hoskins has little to say, conveying a sort of silent menace.  There's never any doubt that this is a man you don't want to cross.Diane Lane's Toni Mannix is an older woman infatuated with Reeves.  Since she and Eddie have an open marriage, there is no need to conduct her affair in the shadows.  She buys Reeves a house and sees to it that he has whatever he wants.  Everything, that is, except decent film roles.Lane looks great, even though she's playing a woman concerned about her fading beauty.  Completely hedonistic, her Toni regards Georgie as her personal amusement, not as an actor striving to move ahead.  We can understand Reeves' attraction to a beautiful woman with powerful connections in Hollywood.Rated R for language, violence, and some sexual content, ""Hollywoodland"" is excellent at weaving a riveting tapestry around a 1950's celebrity and the notoriety caused by his death.  Director Coulter makes the film involving because he approaches it from two angles.  It's not a straightforward biography of Reeves, nor is it a modern film noir.  It contains elements of both, certainly, but has an integrity of its own.  The fact that fine actors have been cast and all do a solid job gives the movie stature.  Rather than solving a decades-old mystery, ""Hollywoodland"" lays out the ""What if...?"" possibilities while shedding some light on George Reeves when he wasn't in that famous costume.",5,The Death

646169,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JP90,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 0]","I liked this film. I liked it a lot.In 1959, actor George Reeves (Ben Affleck), best known for playing ""Superman"" on television, dies of an apparent suicide. Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), a small time private investigator working thankless marriage infidelity cases, receives a lead and meets with Reeves' estranged mother (Lois Smith) who doesn't believe her son committed suicide. Recognizing a headline when he sees it, and needing the publicity for his practice, Simo takes the case and begins to learn about Reeves' personal life. After a bit part in ""Gone With The Wind"", Reeves' career stalls and he haunts popular Hollywood restaurants looking for publicity, a reference, anything to get him some work. Soon, he meets Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the wife of Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), the Controller of MGM and a very powerful man in Hollywood. Toni and George begin an affair and Reeves soon gets the role of ""Superman"" in a super low budget television show. But the television show becomes a huge hit and makes Reeves a star. But Reeves becomes so identified with the role, his acting career suffers and he has difficulty finding other work. When the show is cancelled, he becomes despondent and ends the affair with Toni, who doesn't take the news well. Naturally, Simo is drawn in this direction and questions people involved and raises the ire of some powerful individuals in Hollywood. After watching his son react to the death of his idol poorly and getting beaten up by some thugs, Simo becomes convinced he is on the right path, and becomes more determined to find the truth.""Hollywoodland"" written by Paul Berenbaum and directed by Allen Coulter, both of whom have a background in television, Coulter worked on ""The Sopranos"",  is a very well made film attempting to solve one of Hollywood's greatest puzzles. Did George Reeves commit suicide or was he murdered?We first meet Simo. Brody does a fantastic job of creating this private eye whose life is a constant struggle to survive. Divorced from his wife (Molly Parker), he visits their son, ""Scout"" (Zach Mills) and tries to maintain a normal relationship with him. Living in a rundown apartment building, he unapologetically meets with his clients in his apartment, offering them a folding chair to sit in and pin-up calendars to look at. Simo is always working, looking for a step up, looking for a new opportunity.From the moment Brody appears onscreen, his character becomes a living, breathing human. We see the conflict in his very move and action, we see the weariness he has experienced, we see how he struggles to maintain while looking for that breakthrough case. When the Reeves' case lands in his lap, he recognizes the opportunity. The actor smiles a lot as Simo, but this shows his character's regard for life; he is bemused by the craziness surrounding him, in his life, his profession, in Hollywood. When things take a serious turn, the smile disappears, but returns to show he is trying to deal with the problem at hand.The key to Brody's performance is in Simo's relationship with his son. His wife calls him and asks him to come out to the house. When he arrives, he finds that his son tried to set fire to the couch. Talking to his son, he learns that the boy wanted to get rid of his coveted Superman costume because he didn't want to be associated with his hero anymore. His hero committed suicide, becoming a coward. At a loss for words, Simo tries to comfort his son, but his son's attitude only makes him more determined to find the truth. When Simo visits his son, he becomes a normal human dealing with the complexities of life. These scenes help to ground his character and make him seem real when he is dealing with the more interesting, fantastical elements of Hollywood in the late 50s. Throughout, Brody creates a thoughtful, believable human character who gradually becomes obsessed with finding the truth.After a brief look at Reeves' apparent suicide, the film cuts back and forth between Simo and Reeves, showing us key moments in the actor's life as Simo investigates. As we move back and forth between the two stories, and the different timelines, director Coulter keeps things easy to follow. During the flashbacks, the cinematography is tinted slightly, making it more saturated, clearly setting it apart from the Brody story.As Simo investigates, and learns more of Reeves' life, his life begins to fall apart; a client murders someone, he breaks up with his girlfriend, and he scares his son. This provides a nice counterpoint, because it parallels Reeves life.Interestingly, we watch Reeves' story unfold from a fairly early point, I'm going to guess the early 50s, just before he got the role of ""Superman"". As his story unfolds, and he becomes increasingly unhappy, this mirrors Simo's story; the more involved the private investigator becomes in the story, the less control he has over the case and his life, much like the actor's life.This is some of Affleck's best work in years. Beyond the striking physical resemblance, he doesn't seem to be attempting an imitation, he is creating a character. From the first moment we meet Reeves, Affleck portrays the character as an attention hound, eager for publicity and work. Hanging around a popular Hollywood restaurant, he points out the various famous directors to his companion. Then, when Rita Hayworth arrives, he manages to get strategically close and in a few of the photographs the newspapers take of the famous star. Then he meets Toni (Lane), an older woman. They fall in love and begin a relationship. But Affleck makes the character more than a simple himbo. Yes, he would probably sleep with a woman to get some work, but he doesn't realize who Toni is until after they have slept together. He seems to love her.The ""attention hound"" aspect of Reeves' character is also nicely paralleled in Simo, who never passes an opportunity to have his picture taken for the newspapers. When he takes Reeves' mother to the actor's home, he puts her in a wheelchair and makes sure the newspaper photographers catch him holding his hand on her shoulder.When Reeves learns who she is, he quickly confronts her. Her husband, Eddie (Hoskins) could destroy his career. She reassures him; they have an understanding. Eddie has a mistress and she is allowed to `have fun'. To prove the point, all four have dinner at a restaurant together and Toni attempts to fondle George under the table. Soon, Toni convinces Eddie to buy a house and George moves in.Throughout, Affleck always hints at Reeves' vulnerability, his desire for fame, his need for attention. Even when he has these things, he still wants more. After becoming famous as Superman, he wants to prove he is an actor and searches for more parts, something to show off his acting chops. He manages to get a bit part in ""From Here to Eternity"". During the premiere, he is shocked to find the audience heckling him when he appears on screen. ""Faster than a speeding bullet"" someone shouts. This only serves to make him more depressed. Affleck successfully captures the enigma of this man; at times, he seems depressed but stoically moves forward, at others he seems hopeful about the future. Could he have committed suicide?Diane lane is also very good as Toni Mannix, an older woman infatuated with her new boyfriend. As the relationship grows, she proves to be more than a little obsessed with it. Later, as the relationship falls apart, she is clearly emotionally attached to the actor. Her character really comes into focus late in the film. After Reeves' apparent suicide, she is despondent. Eddie tries to comfort her and we realize they care for each other, and realize why they maintain their marriage, but they will never be in love with each other, which is why they have affairs. Also, after Reeves is dead, she clearly has aged, proving that he did indeed make her feel young, as she states early in their affair.Hoskins is good as the menacing head of a powerful movie studio. But the film doesn't really follow a lead it introduces late in the film and his character is not as powerful as he could be. Menacing yes, memorable no.The production design is immaculate and the attention to detail is fantastic. Simo's apartment building is something we would expect to find in modern day Hollywood, but few know that this type of thing began to pop up as early as the late 50s. Every time he returns to the complex, we see an elderly man working out, trying to maintain his figure for the break he always hopes will happen. The pool is dirty and unused. The restaurants, homes, cars, the brief shots behind the scenes of the television series ""Superman"" all appear to be well-researched and add an air of authenticity to the film. The clothing is also great and Brody wears some great, authentic period clothes. If anyone can find the coat he wears in my size, I'll pay a finders fee.""Hollywoodland"" is a very good film, but it has a major problem. Early on, when Simo visits Reeves' home and uncovers three bullet holes, he rightly questions the suicide theory. But this is never revisited. And the film depicts two possible explanations for Reeves' death, one of which is murder. Yet the killer only shoots one bullet. At the end of the film, Simo's conclusion about the actor's murder is inconclusive and unfulfilling.Yet, the film is very good, filled with great performances, an interesting story and great production values. If the filmmakers had only taken a firmer stand on their theory for the death of ""Superman"", the film would be stronger and could possibly become a classic about the history of Hollywood.FYI, the famous Hollywood sign once stood in a different location and was decorated with lights. When it collapsed, the sign was rebuilt in its present location and form providing the icon we all remember today.",5,4 1/2.

646170,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00005JP90,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[0, 0]","Two conflicting movies fight for dominance in the interesting if seriously flawed ""Hollywoodland."" One of them stars Ben Affleck as Geroge Reeves, a struggling actor who catches his one lucky break by becoming the star of the early TV Series, ""Superman."" Reeves is charming, funny, clever and witty, but not much of an actor. He has an angel in the form of Toni Mannix (an excellent Diane Lane), who picks Reeves to be her personal boytoy, sets him up with a home, jobs, all that her rich husband, MGM Studio VP Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins, channelling his inner Ed Asner). Eddie has his own toys, but he has a dark lining. Then there's the gold-digging Leona, who Reeves has an affair with, much to the consternation of Toni. But then, maybe Toni talked George out of marrying Leona. Or maybe George was just sick of Leona and called off a wedding to be with Toni. We never know, because a depressed Reeves committed suicide in 1959.Or did he? This is the issue that ""Hollywoodland"" grapples with. Any one of these people orbiting Reeves had ample motive to kill him, and his death was clouded in controversy at the time. In this half of the movie, director Allen Coulter (his first movie after critically acclaimed TV episodes of The Sopranos and Rome for HBO) creates an interesting scenario of Old Hollywood, power, and dirty relationships. Not only that, he recreates the 50's in spectacular style, with a particular heads up for all the classic cars you'll see. Affleck is also at his best as the doomed actor, playong all the sides of Reeves in what was an Oscar worthy job.However, there's a second part to this, and that is the Film Noir attached to it. This part stars Adrian Brody, doing a great job as hack detective Louis Simo. Simo gets hired when Reeves' mother raises suspicions that her son would not have killed himself. So Simo goes digging where others are too scared to, and Simo can't afford not to. Brody is engaging as Simo, although I kept thinking of Micheal Imperioli doing Chrissy on The Sopranos, to the point where I began thinking Brody was forced to watch the series to get the part down. And since Simo's story is trying to uncover the truth behind Reeves', it seems that we are forced to watch as the two stories, told as separate timelines (and in Reeves' case, as flashbacks) play out.That's where the schism takes place. Simo's life is coming undone, and ""Hollywoodland"" keeps trying to force-fit Reeves' career slide with Simo's domestic problems. Reeves' life is so interesting that the continual forced jamming of Simo's becomes unsettling; the film works best when Simo is trying to pry up the boards of the all too pristine Hollywood system. There are so many subplots and spinouts from that main course, the movie ultimately falters. It's way better than ""The Black Dahlia"" or ""Zodiac,"" but it's nowhere near the likes of ""LA Confidential."" Or even a couple episodes of The Sopranos, for that matter.",3,HollyWoodBland,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,2941,"['Two', 'conflicting', 'movies', 'fight', 'dominance', 'interesting', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'Hollywoodland', 'One', 'stars', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Geroge', 'Reeves', 'struggling', 'actor', 'who', 'one', 'lucky', 'break', 'becoming', 'star', 'early', 'TV', 'Series', 'Superman', 'charming', 'funny', 'clever', 'witty', 'not', 'much', 'actor', 'angel', 'form', 'Toni', 'Mannix', 'excellent', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'who', 'Reeves', 'be', 'personal', 'boytoy', 'up', 'home', 'jobs', 'rich', 'husband', 'MGM', 'Studio', 'VP', 'Eddie', 'Mannix', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'channelling', 'inner', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Eddie', 'own', 'toys', 'dark', 'lining', 'Then', 'gold-digging', 'Leona', 'who', 'affair', 'much', 'consternation', 'Toni', 'then', 'maybe', 'Toni', 'talked', 'George', 'marrying', 'Leona', 'maybe', 'George', 'was', 'just', 'sick', 'Leona', 'called', 'off', 'wedding', 'be', 'Toni', 'never', 'know', 'depressed', 'Reeves', 'committed', 'suicide', '1959.Or', 'did', 'issue', 'Hollywoodland', 'one', 'people', 'orbiting', 'Reeves', 'had', 'ample', 'motive', 'kill', 'death', 'was', 'clouded', 'controversy', 'time', 'half', 'movie', 'director', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'first', 'movie', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'TV', 'episodes', 'Sopranos', 'Rome', 'HBO', 'interesting', 'scenario', 'Old', 'Hollywood', 'power', 'dirty', 'relationships', 'Not', 'only', 'that', '50', 'spectacular', 'style', 'particular', 'heads', 'up', 'classic', 'cars', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Affleck', 'also', 'best', 'doomed', 'actor', 'sides', 'Reeves', 'what', 'was', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'job.However', 'second', 'part', 'Film', 'Noir', 'attached', 'part', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'hack', 'detective', 'Louis', 'Simo', 'Simo', 'hired', 'when', 'Reeves', 'mother', 'suspicions', 'son', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'killed', 'So', 'Simo', 'digging', 'where', 'others', 'are', 'too', 'scared', 'Simo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'not', 'Brody', 'engaging', 'Simo', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Micheal', 'Imperioli', 'doing', 'Chrissy', 'Sopranos', 'point', 'where', 'began', 'thinking', 'Brody', 'was', 'forced', 'watch', 'series', 'get', 'part', 'down', 'Simo', 'story', 'trying', 'uncover', 'truth', 'Reeves', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'two', 'stories', 'told', 'separate', 'timelines', 'Reeves', 'case', 'flashbacks', 'play', 'out.That', 'where', 'schism', 'place', 'Simo', 'life', 'coming', 'undone', 'Hollywoodland', 'trying', 'force-fit', 'Reeves', 'career', 'slide', 'Simo', 'domestic', 'problems', 'Reeves', 'life', 'so', 'interesting', 'continual', 'forced', 'jamming', 'Simo', 'becomes', 'unsettling', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'Simo', 'trying', 'pry', 'up', 'boards', 'too', 'pristine', 'Hollywood', 'system', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'subplots', 'spinouts', 'main', 'course', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'way', 'better', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'Zodiac', 'nowhere', 'likes', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'even', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Sopranos', 'matter']",N/A

Ben Affleck gives the performance of his career--it turns out he really can act, really can play this part, and with the right weight gain and make up, look remarkably like  the real life George Reeves.  The whole behind-the-scenes focus, the ""true story"" of TV's Superman and his mysterious death, is the compelling part of the film, and even more could have been done with it. The depiction of Hollywood of the 50s, the clothes, the men, the women, the music, the sex, is both sexy and sleazy at the same time, but always interest-holding. When the film changes over to the other plot of the P.I. character, played by Adrian Brody, the  movie becomes snooze city. Brody plays a trite down-at-heels detective with a bad homelife, too many punches from thugs, and a wounded son who needs him to be better than he is. The film, though in color, is fashionedas film noir, but it's too much of film nod-off.

646173,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JP90,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","""Hollywoodland"" is two films in one. One is about the tragic life of actor George Reeves, best known as Superman on TV during the 1950s, who committed suicide in 1959. The other is about an opportunistic private detective Louis Simo hired by Reeves' mother to find out truths behind the mysterious (so say some) death of Reeves. My impression after watching this moody film is, Had first-time feature director Allen Coulter used only the first part as basis of the storyline, telling it in a more straightforward fashion, ""Hollywoodland"" might have been much better than what it is, overlong, unnecessarily complicated nourish film.I am not saying ""Hollywoodland"" is a bad film, but if you are expecting something full of twists and turns like ""L. A. Confidential"" or thrilling crime mystery, you will definitely feel that way. In spite of the superb performance from Oscar-winner Adrian Brody as low-rent private eye, the investigation part has nothing new to offer and the slow-moving plot actually goes nowhere. Obviously Simo's story, or his messy life, is intended to be compared or contrasted to that of Reeves, but his is not just as interesting as that of George Reeves, real-life actor whose unexpected success as Superman becomes a curse for him.In fact, besides several technical things such as film's meticulously realized period details and slick editing, Ben Affleck's portrayal of George Reeves is one of the reasons you should see ""Hollywoodland."" He has created the convincing image of the affable actor with darker side hidden inside, who wanted to be taken seriously, but couldn't achieve it. Diane Lane provides a solid performance as Toni Mannix, older woman and neglected wife of powerful Hollywood producer (Bob Hoskins), and according to the film, Reeves is romantically entangled with her while he is later attracted to Leonore Lemmon, much younger actress-wannabe played by Robin Tunney. All the supporting cast is wonderful, most notably Lois Smith, Joe Spano and Jeffrey DeMunn.Perhaps the real protagonist of ""Hollywoodland"" may be the town of Hollywood itself back in the 50s when old studio system was going and the producers had to find out a new way to attract audiences to the theater, who were more attracted to new kind of pop culture - television and rock music. With this historical background of the American movie history that is certainly interesting. ""Hollywoodland"" could have been a more intriguing film with only one person in its center, not two; that is George Reeves who exactly represents the time when films, music and other pop culture were about to drastically change.",3,"Moody, Well-Acted Noirish Drama That Could Have Been Better with More Straightforward Approach",1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,2620,"['Hollywoodland', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'One', 'tragic', 'life', 'actor', 'George', 'Reeves', 'best', 'known', 'Superman', 'TV', '1950s', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', '1959', 'other', 'opportunistic', 'private', 'detective', 'Louis', 'Simo', 'hired', 'Reeves', 'mother', 'find', 'out', 'truths', 'mysterious', 'say', 'death', 'Reeves', 'impression', 'watching', 'moody', 'film', 'Had', 'first-time', 'feature', 'director', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'used', 'only', 'first', 'part', 'basis', 'storyline', 'telling', 'more', 'straightforward', 'fashion', 'Hollywoodland', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'overlong', 'unnecessarily', 'complicated', 'nourish', 'film.I', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'Hollywoodland', 'bad', 'film', 'are', 'expecting', 'something', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'L.', 'A', 'Confidential', 'thrilling', 'crime', 'mystery', 'will', 'definitely', 'feel', 'way', 'spite', 'superb', 'performance', 'Oscar-winner', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'low-rent', 'private', 'eye', 'investigation', 'part', 'nothing', 'new', 'offer', 'slow-moving', 'plot', 'actually', 'nowhere', 'Obviously', 'Simo', 'story', 'messy', 'life', 'intended', 'be', 'compared', 'contrasted', 'Reeves', 'not', 'just', 'as', 'interesting', 'George', 'Reeves', 'real-life', 'actor', 'unexpected', 'success', 'Superman', 'curse', 'him.In', 'fact', 'several', 'technical', 'things', 'such', 'film', 'meticulously', 'realized', 'period', 'details', 'slick', 'editing', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'portrayal', 'George', 'Reeves', 'one', 'reasons', 'should', 'see', 'Hollywoodland', 'created', 'convincing', 'image', 'affable', 'actor', 'darker', 'side', 'hidden', 'inside', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'solid', 'performance', 'Toni', 'Mannix', 'older', 'woman', 'neglected', 'wife', 'powerful', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'according', 'film', 'Reeves', 'romantically', 'entangled', 'later', 'attracted', 'Leonore', 'Lemmon', 'much', 'younger', 'actress-wannabe', 'played', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'supporting', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'most', 'notably', 'Lois', 'Smith', 'Joe', 'Spano', 'Jeffrey', 'DeMunn.Perhaps', 'real', 'protagonist', 'Hollywoodland', 'may', 'be', 'town', 'Hollywood', 'back', '50s', 'when', 'old', 'studio', 'system', 'was', 'going', 'producers', 'had', 'find', 'out', 'new', 'way', 'attract', 'audiences', 'theater', 'who', 'were', 'more', 'attracted', 'new', 'kind', 'pop', 'culture', 'television', 'rock', 'music', 'historical', 'background', 'American', 'movie', 'history', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'Hollywoodland', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'intriguing', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'center', 'not', 'two', 'George', 'Reeves', 'who', 'exactly', 'time', 'when', 'films', 'music', 'other', 'pop', 'culture', 'were', 'about', 'drastically', 'change']",N/A

He is absolutely brilliant as TV Superman George Reeves, struggling to deal with unwelcome TV fame while yearning to be an A-list Hollywood actor. It is a tour de force performance from a man whose own career struggles seem to have provided the basis for insight into Reeves. Diane Lane and Bob Hoskins are brilliant as the Mannix's, MGM's ""fixer"" and his promiscuous wife.

Incidentally he is also a Reeve (George Reeves) like the Chirstopher Reeve who was to take over a superman in the movie. Plays itself as a whodunnit but does not reach to any conclusion as it is based on a true story. The case was closed as a suicide but along the movie we find a low life private investigator played by Adrien Brodie try to understand and through his mind's eye we see three possible ways in which Reeves could have died including the official suicide scenario. It's a run of the mill movie which you know cannot provide you anything startling as it has to stay true to the fact. So you kind of know it's destined to an anti-climatic end but you stick around for the period sets and costumes and the acting.

646177,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B00005JP90,Wayne C. Rogers,"[2, 3]","When I first saw Hollywoodland at the theater last year, I came away thinking that it wasn't a great movie, but at the same time, it wasn't a total clunker.  Because I'm a fan of movies about old Los Angeles, I decided to go ahead and purchase the DVD when it came out last week.  After rewatching it, I have to admit to enjoying the movie more the second time around than I did the first.  I know that the first time I saw it, I was expecting the film to be more about the late George Reeves (I was a child fan of the Superman series back during the Fifties and was devastated when he died) and his life.  I thought the parts dealing with Louis Simo (played by Adrien Brody) investigating the death of Reeves to be unnecessary.  This time, I saw the movie as being more about Simo and how his life was tumbling down around him and how both he and Reeves wanted more from Hollywood than it was able to give.  Though their are no clear answers with regards to Reeves' apparent suicide, I think he did, in fact, kill himself.  There was a scene in the movie that I missed the first time and it explained a lot.  It's near the end when Reeves' agent comes to his home and urges him to take the wrestling gig.  They're in the living room and Reeves is looking out the window at the front lawn.  If you watch carefully, you can see a man getting out of his car and placing a ""For Sell"" sign on the lawn.  Because Reeves had decided to break up with Toni Mannix, she was getting back at him by selling the house that she'd given to him as a gift.  The man now had no money, no home, and no future prospects for making his dream come true.  I probably would've killed myself, too.  Hollywoodland is beautifully filmed, capturing the atmosphere of old Hollywood down to every detail, especially with the soft colors.  Diane Lane as the beautiful Toni Mannix shows what a fine actress she has become over the years.  Adrien Brody as the down-and-out private investigator does an excellent job of protraying a man who is slowly destroying his life and doesn't know how to stop.  It is, however, Ben Affleck as George Reeves, who steals the movie.  There are scenes where Affleck actually looks and sounds like the late Reeves.  He nailed this role down perfectly, showing how unmerciful Hollywood can be to those seeking the glitz and glamour and what it does to one's soul and dreams.  Like Reeves' agent says at the end of the movie, ""George was a star.  He just didn't know it.  Three million kids worshipped him.""  I was one of those kids.  The DVD has three short featurettes on it, dealing with the making of the movie and old Hollywood.  Each one is about seven to nine minutes long.  There are a couple of deleted scenes, plus a commentary of the movie by its director, Allen Coulter.  I think Hollywoodland will eventually gain a larger audience over time because it's a movie that simply gets better with each viewing.",4,Much better the second time around!,1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,2918,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'Hollywoodland', 'theater', 'last', 'year', 'came', 'away', 'thinking', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'clunker', ""'m"", 'fan', 'movies', 'old', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'decided', 'go', 'ahead', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'last', 'week', 'rewatching', 'have', 'admit', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'did', 'first', 'know', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'expecting', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'late', 'George', 'Reeves', 'was', 'child', 'fan', 'Superman', 'series', 'back', 'Fifties', 'was', 'devastated', 'when', 'died', 'life', 'thought', 'parts', 'dealing', 'Louis', 'Simo', 'played', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'investigating', 'death', 'Reeves', 'be', 'unnecessary', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'being', 'more', 'Simo', 'how', 'life', 'was', 'tumbling', 'down', 'how', 'wanted', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'able', 'give', 'are', 'clear', 'answers', 'regards', 'Reeves', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'think', 'did', 'fact', 'kill', 'was', 'scene', 'movie', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'explained', 'lot', 'end', 'when', 'Reeves', 'agent', 'home', 'take', 'wrestling', 'gig', ""'re"", 'living', 'room', 'Reeves', 'looking', 'out', 'window', 'front', 'lawn', 'watch', 'carefully', 'can', 'see', 'man', 'getting', 'car', 'placing', 'Sell', 'sign', 'lawn', 'Reeves', 'had', 'decided', 'break', 'up', 'Toni', 'Mannix', 'was', 'getting', 'back', 'selling', 'house', ""'d"", 'given', 'gift', 'man', 'now', 'had', 'money', 'home', 'future', 'prospects', 'making', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'killed', 'too', 'Hollywoodland', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'capturing', 'atmosphere', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'down', 'detail', 'especially', 'soft', 'colors', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'beautiful', 'Toni', 'Mannix', 'what', 'fine', 'actress', 'become', 'years', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'down-and-out', 'private', 'investigator', 'excellent', 'job', 'protraying', 'man', 'who', 'slowly', 'destroying', 'life', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'stop', 'however', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'George', 'Reeves', 'who', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'Affleck', 'actually', 'late', 'Reeves', 'nailed', 'role', 'down', 'perfectly', 'showing', 'how', 'unmerciful', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'be', 'seeking', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'what', 'one', 'soul', 'dreams', 'Reeves', 'agent', 'end', 'movie', 'George', 'was', 'star', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Three', 'million', 'kids', 'worshipped', 'was', 'one', 'kids', 'DVD', 'three', 'short', 'featurettes', 'dealing', 'making', 'movie', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'about', 'seven', 'nine', 'minutes', 'long', 'are', 'couple', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'movie', 'director', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'think', 'Hollywoodland', 'will', 'eventually', 'gain', 'larger', 'audience', 'time', 'movie', 'simply', 'better', 'viewing']",N/A
646178,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JP90,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 3]","One moment George Reeves was one of the most popular performers on TV and the next he was reduced to a suicide headline. Reality collides with make-believe in the appropriately titled ""Hollywoodland"" a film that looks into the rise, fall and death of actor George Reeves best known for his performances as ""Superman"" and in ""From Here to Eternity"". Detective Louis Simo (Adrian Brody) is hired to find out if Reeves' (Ben Affleck in a marvelous performance) death was suicide or if he was murdered by MGM studio executive Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins) as a fall out of the affair Reeves had with Mannix's wife Toni (Diane Lane). Mannix held power at the end of the studio reign and was brought in to be a ""problem fixer"" and Simo suspects that Reeves became just another mess for him to clean up as he amasses evidence of Mannix's attempts to damage Reeves career. Perhaps he was murdered by his disappointed hard fianc&eacute; Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney) all the different fingers on the hand of death point to possibly different conclusions all with evidence. Simo must sort through it all, separate his own issues and try and discover what really happened for his own piece of mind.  Simo has some cleaning up to do himself as well with a busted marriage to Laurie (Molly Parker of ""Deadwood"" fame) and his disillusioned, alienated son.Although director Allen Coulter (""Rome"", ""Six Feet Under"" and ""The Sopranos"") tries to build suspense via his parallel stories of loss and deception, his balancing act is at times uneven. While Simo's attempt to dig into Reeves death by suicide is interesting, it can't hold a candle to Reeves' own unraveling career and life. Simo's story as fascinating as it is and kicks into high gear whenever he's imagining what might have happened. The ""Chinatown"" mystery elements don't work quite as well as the rest of the picture. That's not to slight the cast, writer or director--the entire cast does a marvelous job with the roles they are given and writer Paul Bernbaum's attempt to mirror these two very different men's lives and circumstances are admirable but just beyond his grasp in this ambitious screenplay. ""Hollywoodland"" with all the mythical, fantasy, child-like grandeur the name alludes to (the fantasy elements make it seem almost like a pun on ""Disneyland"" but, in reality, until the sign became derelict that's what they said. The restored portion that everyone sees today remains) masks the seamy side that hides in the underbelly the ""company town"". ""Hollywoodland"" despite its minor flaws is a ride worth taking at least once.We get deleted scenes, a trio of featurettes on recreating the era, the real Reeves case (though it's told via the actors and the film which is disappointing. I would have preferred vintage footage)and an intelligent commentary by director Allen Coulter. Interestingly one of the producers comments about how Hollywood was pristine at that time when I seem to recall that even during the 50's that smog was a problem.This is a exceptional film that probably would have worked better if it had stuck more with Reeves story. I felt the framing story involving Simco (Brody) just wasn't as captivating or strong. Regardless, this is worth the rental or even a purchase and Coulter captures the noir elements very well.",3,Fantasy and reality intersect at the boulevard of broken dreams 3 1/2 stars,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,3296,"['One', 'moment', 'George', 'Reeves', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'performers', 'TV', 'next', 'was', 'reduced', 'suicide', 'headline', 'Reality', 'make-believe', 'appropriately', 'titled', 'Hollywoodland', 'film', 'rise', 'fall', 'death', 'actor', 'George', 'Reeves', 'best', 'known', 'performances', 'Superman', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'Detective', 'Louis', 'Simo', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'hired', 'find', 'out', 'Reeves', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'death', 'was', 'suicide', 'was', 'murdered', 'MGM', 'studio', 'executive', 'Eddie', 'Mannix', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'fall', 'affair', 'Reeves', 'had', 'Mannix', 'wife', 'Toni', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Mannix', 'held', 'power', 'end', 'studio', 'reign', 'was', 'brought', 'be', 'problem', 'fixer', 'Simo', 'Reeves', 'became', 'just', 'mess', 'clean', 'up', 'evidence', 'Mannix', 'attempts', 'damage', 'Reeves', 'career', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'murdered', 'disappointed', 'hard', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Leonore', 'Lemmon', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'different', 'fingers', 'hand', 'death', 'point', 'possibly', 'different', 'conclusions', 'evidence', 'Simo', 'must', 'sort', 'separate', 'own', 'issues', 'try', 'discover', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'own', 'piece', 'mind', 'Simo', 'cleaning', 'up', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'busted', 'marriage', 'Laurie', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'Deadwood', 'fame', 'disillusioned', 'alienated', 'son.Although', 'director', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'Rome', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Sopranos', 'build', 'suspense', 'parallel', 'stories', 'loss', 'deception', 'balancing', 'act', 'times', 'uneven', 'Simo', 'attempt', 'dig', 'Reeves', 'death', 'suicide', 'interesting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'Reeves', 'own', 'unraveling', 'career', 'life', 'Simo', 'story', 'as', 'fascinating', 'high', 'gear', 'imagining', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'Chinatown', 'mystery', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'picture', 'not', 'slight', 'cast', 'writer', 'director', 'entire', 'cast', 'marvelous', 'job', 'roles', 'are', 'given', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Bernbaum', 'attempt', 'mirror', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'lives', 'circumstances', 'are', 'admirable', 'just', 'grasp', 'ambitious', 'screenplay', 'Hollywoodland', 'mythical', 'fantasy', 'child-like', 'grandeur', 'name', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'make', 'almost', 'pun', 'Disneyland', 'reality', 'sign', 'became', 'derelict', 'what', 'said', 'restored', 'portion', 'everyone', 'sees', 'today', 'seamy', 'side', 'underbelly', 'company', 'town', 'Hollywoodland', 'minor', 'flaws', 'ride', 'worth', 'taking', 'least', 'once.We', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trio', 'featurettes', 'recreating', 'era', 'real', 'Reeves', 'case', 'told', 'actors', 'film', 'disappointing', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'vintage', 'footage', 'intelligent', 'commentary', 'director', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'Interestingly', 'one', 'producers', 'comments', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'pristine', 'time', 'when', 'seem', 'recall', 'even', '50', 'smog', 'was', 'problem.This', 'exceptional', 'film', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'stuck', 'more', 'Reeves', 'story', 'felt', 'framing', 'story', 'involving', 'Simco', 'Brody', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'captivating', 'strong', 'Regardless', 'rental', 'even', 'purchase', 'Coulter', 'noir', 'elements', 'very', 'well']",N/A

He was a character actor in the 1940's and he felt he had been typed as Superman and wouldn't be able to obtain other acting roles. This was true and he realized it. He was susceptible to women not good for him, that dragged him down. Ben Affleck does an excellent job in a role made for him. That is the key to his form of acting. Getting roles actually made for him. Anyway, Ben reflects perfectly the agony of George Reeves and you can sense it and see it in his movie body language. The players surrounding him are good in their roles and it is upsetting to see how they &#34;feed&#34; off of Superman. Diane Lane is very good and again it is so sad to see how Reeves allows himself to be at her beck and call. The questions surrounding Reeves death point to either the movie mogul using a hit man or his wife herself. After he was her toy boy and if she felt he wanted to leave, why would she jeopardize her position even if she had an open marriage. Reeves body had bruises on it indicating he was hit by more than one person.
