729453,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00007JMDJ,Byron Kolln,"[5, 6]","YOUNG PEOPLE (1940) was, despite it's mix of the regular Temple movie trappings, an even bigger flop at the box office than THE BLUE BIRD, released earlier that same year.  Back in black-and-white, and with the ""child star"" cuteness becoming a slightly uncomfortable fit for the rapidly maturing twelve-year-old Temple, it lacks a certain zest; although Temple gives a great performance and is matched every step of the way by her co-stars Jack Oakie and Charlotte Greenwood.The story follows vaudeville team Joe and Kitty Ballantine (Oakie and Greenwood) and their adopted daughter Wendy (Temple) as they attempt to retire on a farm in New England, only to find hostility and scorn from their old-fashioned, small-minded neighbours.This was Shirley's last movie for Fox.  After her two failures in 1940 (and with no scripts on the immediate horizon), it was decided, in an agreement between producer Darryl F. Zanuck and Temple's parents, to finally terminate her contract.  Oddly enough, one of the songs in the film (""Young People"") contains lyrics that keenly reflected Temple's personal situation at the time.  Audiences wanted Shirley to remain a curly-haired moppet, Temple wanted to grow up.  Something had to give...YOUNG PEOPLE features a clever prologue in which we actually ""see"" the Wendy/Temple character grow up whilst performing in the Ballantine's act.  This was achieved by using a body double for long-shots, intercut with footage of Shirley herself performing ""The Beaches of Waikiki"" from 1935's CURLY TOP, and ""Baby, Take a Bow"" from 1934's STAND UP AND CHEER!  Despite it's shortcomings, YOUNG PEOPLE is a solid movie and a worthy and touching coda to Shirley Temple's Fox years.",3,Temple's last Fox musical,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,1702,"['YOUNG', 'PEOPLE', '1940', 'was', 'mix', 'regular', 'Temple', 'movie', 'trappings', 'even', 'bigger', 'flop', 'box', 'office', 'THE', 'BLUE', 'BIRD', 'released', 'earlier', 'same', 'year', 'Back', 'black-and-white', 'child', 'star', 'cuteness', 'becoming', 'slightly', 'uncomfortable', 'fit', 'rapidly', 'maturing', 'twelve-year-old', 'Temple', 'certain', 'zest', 'Temple', 'great', 'performance', 'matched', 'step', 'way', 'co-stars', 'Jack', 'Oakie', 'Charlotte', 'Greenwood.The', 'story', 'vaudeville', 'team', 'Joe', 'Kitty', 'Ballantine', 'Oakie', 'Greenwood', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Wendy', 'Temple', 'attempt', 'retire', 'farm', 'New', 'England', 'only', 'find', 'hostility', 'scorn', 'old-fashioned', 'small-minded', 'neighbours.This', 'was', 'Shirley', 'last', 'movie', 'Fox', 'two', 'failures', '1940', 'scripts', 'immediate', 'horizon', 'was', 'decided', 'agreement', 'producer', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'Temple', 'parents', 'finally', 'terminate', 'contract', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'one', 'songs', 'film', 'Young', 'People', 'lyrics', 'keenly', 'reflected', 'Temple', 'personal', 'situation', 'time', 'Audiences', 'wanted', 'Shirley', 'remain', 'curly-haired', 'moppet', 'Temple', 'wanted', 'grow', 'up', 'Something', 'had', 'give', 'YOUNG', 'PEOPLE', 'clever', 'prologue', 'actually', 'see', 'Wendy/Temple', 'character', 'grow', 'up', 'whilst', 'performing', 'Ballantine', 'act', 'was', 'achieved', 'using', 'body', 'double', 'long-shots', 'intercut', 'footage', 'Shirley', 'performing', 'Beaches', 'Waikiki', '1935', 'CURLY', 'TOP', 'Baby', 'Take', 'Bow', '1934', 'STAND', 'UP', 'AND', 'CHEER', 'shortcomings', 'YOUNG', 'PEOPLE', 'solid', 'movie', 'worthy', 'touching', 'coda', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Fox', 'years']",Young People VHS

729455,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B00007JMDJ,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[21, 30]","Fox continues to release the Temple films without any real extras; this one appears to be no exception. According to the Fox press release, all films have undergone restoration, although ""Wee Willie Winkie"" is the only one that shows the restoration comparison. Since it was also part of a John Ford boxed set, it underwent the most extensive overhaul (about 77 hours according to the background information on the DVD). Original elements at Fox were unusable for ""Winkie,"" but the final result is very good. ""Stowaway"" is probably the least of the three, lacking sharpness, but about what you'd expect from a film of this era. As a departure from the other releases in this series, there are NO colorized films in this set. For film buffs, this is a plus!""Stowaway"" (1936) Story: Ching-Ching (Temple), a child whose guardians are killed in Shanghai, seeks refuge from the streets in a car's open trunk, only to wake up and find the car on a ship bound for the U.S. The car's owner, a wealthy playboy (Robert Young), is charmed by Ching-Ching, and offers to marry another passenger (Alice Faye) in order to keep the child. When the two adults meet in divorce court, it's up to Ching-Ching to keep them together. Quite a few memorable songs (Faye & Temple on ""Goodnight My Love"" & Temple imitating Ginger Rogers & Al Jolson in ""You've Gotta' S.M.I.L.E."") Features the original black and white film in its original theatrical aspect ratio with English Stereo and English and Spanish Mono and includes English, French and Spanish subtitles. 85 minutes.""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937) Loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's popular story. Taken by her mother (June Lang) to live in India, a young girl (Temple) gradually wins the heart of her feisty grandfather (C. Aubrey Smith), a colonel at a British army outpost. Before long, she captures the hearts of his entire regiment as well as his chief enemy (Cesar Romero), using her charms to prevent a full-scale war. Directed by John Ford; definitely one of Temple's best films. Presented as a flipper disc featuring a tinted version of the film (in a very pleasing sepia tone) that was based on original notes and research to make the film look as it was first released as well as the black and white original, both in their original full-screen theatrical aspect ratio. With English Stereo plus English and Spanish Mono, the feature also includes English, French and Spanish subtitles. 100 minutes. Bonus feature: Restoration Comparison.""Young People"" (1940) Story: Wendy (Temple, in her final film at Fox) is adopted as an infant by the husband and wife vaudeville team of Joe and Kit Ballantine (Jack Oakie and Charlotte Greenwood), she grows into childhood as a vital part of their act. As she approaches school age, the couple feels that life on the road is not the best thing for Wendy and decide to settle down on a farm in Vermont. However, the locals openly express their doubts about the morality of show business people. A few pleasing tunes (""On Fifth Avenue"" and ""Tra La La La"") and some solid performances, but it comes off as an enjoyable B-Movie version of the Judy Garland & Mickey Rooney backyard musicals...WITHOUT a Mickey. Shirley shows the awkwardness of a teen; her acting and dance routines do not look natural; they seem very mannered and over-rehearsed. With a higher quality director and better script, Shirley could have had a more successful transition into the teen years (as witnessed by her later films during the Selznick years). Greenwood is great in this film, but Oakie comes off as an oaf. His dancing in the finale (""Tra La La"") is plain horrible; instead of dancing, he looks like he is fighting off a bad case of gas. Original black and white film in its original theatrical aspect ratio with English Stereo and English and Spanish Mono and includes English, French and Spanish subtitles and a theatrical trailer that really would have benefitted from a little digital stabilization. 78 minutes.Just saw this on the web: ""Fox Home Entertainment, the video division of movie studio 20th Century Fox, is marking [Shirley Temple] Black's [80th] birthday on Wednesday by releasing the sixth and last volume of a retrospective series of her films.""

I was pretty impressed with the quality of the restorations here, in any case.  Stowaway had a little bit of grain or dirt at the beginning, but the rest of the print seemed nice and clear.  Wee Willie Winkie and Young People were likewise very nicely restored.I watched the tinted version of Wee Willie Winkie (it just happened to be the side of the disc I set into the player).  The sepia was nice... but I was a little thrown by the cyan tinting for the nighttime scenes!  All in all, though, this was probably the best film of the bunch.  The story was stronger than that of the usual Temple vehicle, and the supporting characters were good.Stowaway is pure Shirley Temple, one of the four trademark films she made in 1936 (the others being Captain January, The Poor Little Rich Girl, and Dimples).  The racist overtones and over-the-top characterizations of the Chinese may make some people uncomfortable.  But it was the 1930s after all, and political correctness hadn't yet come into play.  There are still some great musical numbers, though, and watching Shirley spout proverbs like a little fortune cookie is always amusing.Young People is the weakest of the set.  You can't help but feel vaguely embarrassed for everyone involved as they plod through the contrived plot and silly lines.  The few catchy songs are probably the movie's only redeeming quality.All in all, the quality of the prints is what makes this a decent set.

She was twelve years old and as perky as ever, but her popularity was waning for a variety of reasons.Shirley plays Wendy Ballantine, an orphan in the care of Joe Ballantine (Jack Oakie, who had more than 100 movie and television appearances) and Kit Ballantine (Charlotte Greenwood, who some may remember in ""Oklahoma!"").  Joe and Kit raise Wendy as though she was their own daughter.  This film uses clips of Shirley from her earlier movies to show her at various ages.  The gimmick generally works.Joe, Kit and Wendy are a popular vaudeville act, but being in show business puts them on the road and in hotels constantly.  Kit and Joe decide that it would be better for Wendy to settle down.  The trio settles on a farm purchased by Wendy's late father.Unfortunately, the small town near the farm is full of ultra-conservative people who have a dislike and distrust of anything new.  By new, I mean anything that has existed for less than 50 years.  Some of the townspeople do everything possible to drive the Ballantines out of town.  The last straw seems to be when Wendy organizes her classmates into a rousing vaudeville style show, which somehow upsets the ultra-conservative sensibilities of the townspeople.After the continuously offensive treatment by the townspeople, the Ballantines decide to leave town and go back to show business.  On their way to the train station their car gets stuck in the mud, caused by a powerful storm.  The Ballantines head for shelter and encounter a group of children stranded by the storm.  The Ballantines shepherd the children to a nearby house, but one of the children is missing!Will the missing child be found?  Will everyone survive the terrible storm?  Will the Ballantines miss their train?  The answer to these and other questions await the viewer!This movie misses the magic of Shirley's earlier movies.  Shirley does a fine job, as do the other members of the cast, but the script and the plot are less than inspired.  I did like the movie even though the ending was highly predictable and I recommend the movie to fans of Shirley and Jack Oakie.  If you want to see Shirley at her prime I recommend most of the movies she made from 1934 to 1939 as a better starting point.  Watch this movie only after you have seen a number of her other movies.Good Luck!",3,Light Comedy for Shirley Temple,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,2393,"['Shirley', 'Temple', 'movie', 'career', 'was', 'peak', 'when', 'appeared', 'movie', 'was', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'as', 'perky', 'ever', 'popularity', 'was', 'waning', 'variety', 'reasons.Shirley', 'plays', 'Wendy', 'Ballantine', 'orphan', 'care', 'Joe', 'Ballantine', 'Jack', 'Oakie', 'who', 'had', 'more', '100', 'movie', 'television', 'appearances', 'Kit', 'Ballantine', 'Charlotte', 'Greenwood', 'who', 'may', 'remember', 'Oklahoma', 'Joe', 'Kit', 'raise', 'Wendy', 'was', 'own', 'daughter', 'film', 'clips', 'Shirley', 'earlier', 'movies', 'show', 'various', 'ages', 'gimmick', 'generally', 'Kit', 'Wendy', 'are', 'popular', 'vaudeville', 'act', 'being', 'show', 'business', 'road', 'hotels', 'constantly', 'Kit', 'Joe', 'decide', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'Wendy', 'settle', 'down', 'trio', 'farm', 'purchased', 'Wendy', 'late', 'father.Unfortunately', 'small', 'town', 'farm', 'full', 'ultra-conservative', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'dislike', 'distrust', 'anything', 'new', 'new', 'mean', 'anything', 'existed', 'less', '50', 'years', 'townspeople', 'do', 'everything', 'possible', 'drive', 'Ballantines', 'town', 'last', 'straw', 'be', 'when', 'Wendy', 'classmates', 'rousing', 'vaudeville', 'style', 'show', 'somehow', 'ultra-conservative', 'sensibilities', 'townspeople.After', 'continuously', 'offensive', 'treatment', 'townspeople', 'Ballantines', 'decide', 'leave', 'town', 'go', 'back', 'show', 'business', 'way', 'train', 'station', 'car', 'stuck', 'mud', 'caused', 'powerful', 'storm', 'Ballantines', 'head', 'shelter', 'encounter', 'group', 'children', 'stranded', 'storm', 'Ballantines', 'shepherd', 'children', 'nearby', 'house', 'one', 'children', 'missing', 'Will', 'missing', 'child', 'be', 'found', 'Will', 'everyone', 'survive', 'terrible', 'storm', 'Will', 'Ballantines', 'miss', 'train', 'answer', 'other', 'questions', 'await', 'viewer', 'movie', 'magic', 'Shirley', 'earlier', 'movies', 'Shirley', 'fine', 'job', 'do', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'script', 'plot', 'are', 'less', 'inspired', 'did', 'movie', 'even', 'ending', 'was', 'highly', 'predictable', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'Shirley', 'Jack', 'Oakie', 'want', 'see', 'Shirley', 'prime', 'recommend', 'most', 'movies', 'made', '1934', '1939', 'better', 'starting', 'point', 'Watch', 'movie', 'only', 'have', 'seen', 'number', 'other', 'movies.Good', 'Luck']",Young People VHS

But one has to keep in mind (or should, at least) the era in which these films were first seen.  Times were hard.  The last thing moviegoers needed was a story about failure--amd only a few movies of the period so much as mentioned the hard times.Then along came this little girl--singing, dancing, smiling, and always prevailing because she had those darned dimples and those sausage curls.  Who cared that the stories made no sense?  People left the theater feeling just a little better, I imagine.  For a hint of this, see Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo.""The stories in this collection are not among Shirley Temple's best, but then her best films weren't much either, if you took her talent and personality away from them.  For example, ""Stowaway"" manages to get a little American girl lost in China and put her into the trunk of a luxury car placed on a ship bound for California.

Shirley plays Wendy Ballantine, the adopted daughter of two vaudevillians (Jack Oakie and Charlotte Greenwood).  The film follows The Three Ballantines throughout their career, using archival footage from some of the real-life Shirley's earlier films.  They decide to retire from show business and move to a bucolic New England farm community, where they are not welcomed by the neighbors, who distrust showbiz folk, and their hostility increases when Wendy puts together a musical starring her classmates.  Eventually, the Ballantines get tired of all this abuse, and decide to return to vaudeville.  On their way out, their car gets stuck in the mud during a severe storm, and they rescue some children who are also stranded (although one child was missing, but was eventually rescued).  Oddly enough, the Ballantines' rescue efforts make them heroes in the eyes of their formerly hostile neighbors, and they decide to stay in New England after all.The musical numbers, mostly in the first part of the film, are superb.  Shirley's great dancing, particularly on ""Fifth Avenue,"" makes you wonder what might have been if she had stayed in musical comedy.Aside from the usual fake stereo, English mono, and Spanish mono soundtracks, plus English, Spanish, and this time French subtitles, the only extra is the theatrical trailer.
