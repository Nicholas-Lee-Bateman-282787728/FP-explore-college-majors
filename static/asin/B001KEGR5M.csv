1207578,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,B001KEGR5M,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[1, 2]","I love America earnestly, and admit this without embarrassment or reluctance.  I even proudly served in our nation's armed forces out of a sense of patriotic calling.  Though I realize that our country is not perfect, just as no nation or society inhabited by fallible humans can achieve perfection in the practice of its principles or execution of its laws.  Nonetheless, I truly believe this is one of the few societies in this world's history that where noble aspirations for governance have been successfully (though not perfectly) established to ensure freedom and stability - and the U.S. is still the one with the best track record.That having been said, if I were to list the things about American society that I am least fond of, one of them is the fetish that a large portion of the population has with low-grade worshipping of celebrity pop ""culture"" (an ironic and oxymoronic phrase).  To be obsessed about which `celebrity' (an arbitrary, nebulous, loosely defined, often temporary, and ultimately insubstantial designation) is dating whom, or preoccupied about the status of a celebrity's marriage, or to be keenly interested about their mundane and tedious activities is a reliable indication of the banality of one's own existence.  Furthermore, the dubious standard for obtaining celebrity status is both becoming much easier and much less meaningful.Even more astonishing is the thorough extent to which these unremarkable vessels of self-promotion and mediocrity actually take themselves seriously.  Even on those rare occasions when celebrities `deign' to allow a feebly satirical portrayal of themselves, it is still limited to the narrow and vacuous limitations that their conceit and vanity permit, rather than an earnest or bold or creative bit of self-effacing humor.That is not to say that there aren't some celebrities who don't take themselves too seriously, and have a solid sense of humor to prove it.A case in point:The Mrs. and I rented MY NAME IS BRUCE this past weekend.  It is a scathing yet rather amusing self-parody starring and directed by none other than cult-favorite icon himself: Bruce Campbell.  It is remarkable in the humorously unflattering portrayal of the film's protagonist and principle lead - which are the same person.  What makes this work so effectively is Campbell's having the sense of humor and robust self-esteem (without seemingly being overwhelmed by the mound of insecurities which seems to accompany and define the caricature of pop culture ""celebrity"") that enable him to make fun of himself in such an effective and entertaining manner.  It is a brutally fictitious (hopefully) satire which depicts Campbell as a third-rate screen hack and a thoroughly dysfunctional egomaniac whose personal life is an utter mess and whose everyday existence is depicted as a glib version of one of Dante's circles.THE PLOT: While Bruce is filming a remarkably bad low-budget sci-fi film (even by Bruce's own undemanding standards), a homicidal demon is released into a small Oregon town by teenaged shenanigans.  One of said teens is a completely devout Bruce Campbell fanatic whose idolization borders on obsession.Getting it in his head that Bruce Campbell's on-screen persona would translate into real-life heroics, the teen convinces the town that Bruce is the only hope they have of saving themselves from the demon's murderous wrath.  Thinking it's some kind of a gig, Bruce shows up (not entirely voluntary) and is treated like minor royalty by the townspeople who, unbeknownst to Bruce, expect the irritatingly entitled and obnoxiously aloof actor to save them and their town. (END of PLOT SUMMARY)Though the Mrs. and I are choosy about comedies and I am not an easy laugh, we had (guardedly) optimistic expectations about enjoying the film.  As it turned out, this movie was even funnier than we thought it would be!  There are several Laugh-Out-Loud moments throughout the film, which may be destined for an esteemed place in the pantheon of cult filmdom (it could happen).MY NAME IS BRUCE is purposely done as a bad cheap low-budget movie to mirror Campbell's life with that of his filmwork.  It has some cartoonish violence (no explicit gore) and some language that might make it a better film to watch when the little ones aren't in the room, but otherwise is a lot of laughs.  It's one of the most entertaining films we have seen in quite a while.  Even the Special Features have some humorous and interesting material.  In fact, watching the behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of the film is actually more interesting and entertaining than some films I can think of.Granted, this movie may not be for everyone.  The demographic is somewhat easily defined.  In fact, the young woman working the register at Blockbuster where & when we rented the film told us she didn't like the movie, but that's because clearly she was mentally ill.  She also said that she didn't even like ARMY OF DARKNESS at all.  How disturbed is she???Nonetheless, if you're the kind who would consider renting or watching this film in the first place, it's a fair to good bet that statistically you will most likely enjoy the film.

1207580,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B001KEGR5M,Brandon J. Smith,"[2, 4]","A B-Movie to its core, this is exactly the movie one would expect it to be. Bruce Campbell, free from any restraints or limitations (other than budget), stuffs this movie with as many one-liners and gags as he can, gives buddy Ted Raimi no less than three roles, and positively revels in the low-budget nature of the production. On the one hand, it works brilliantly - he's an extremely charismatic actor, is genuinely funny, and is even a bit courageous to spoof himself so directly.On the other hand, it's a bit of a shame that the movie doesn't aim a little higher. Especially given the triumph that was Bubba Ho-Tep and his recent work on Burn Notice, Bruce seems like he'd be in a place that would allow him to reach for more. One of the great things about Campbell's classics is the innovation he and the Raimis brought. The Evil Dead movies in particular were more than just horror/comedies - they were experiments. My Name is Bruce is more of a victory lap by a man who's become a show-business legend (even if he's not exactly a big star).As a long-time Bruce Campbell fan, I found a lot to enjoy in this movie - his one-liners are the best in the biz, as far as I'm concerned. There's also a ton of special features, as well as a mini-comic-book, which makes for a nice package.

I like Bruce Campbell, I smile everytime I see him in a film, on a T.V. show or in a commercial.  He makes me laugh with his wisecracking humor and he's been in the type of B-movie guilty pleasures I'll always overrate thanks to his presence.  The Evil Dead films happen to be some of my favorite horror films ever, particularly the second one which he played a large part in making special.  Army of Darkness is a laugh riot goof ball comedy and no matter what his critics may say, I do feel he has plenty of acting ability to pull off more dramatic roles.Having said all that, I don't like this movie.  It tries too hard to be funny and I think they approached it the wrong way.  There was no need to make a spoof of Bruce Campbell or his films since so many of his films intentionally cast him knowing they are spoofing themselves.  This movie is the equivalaent of someone repeating a joke after everyone has already laughed at it, and then laughing at their own joke.  It just didn't work for me overall, it would have made a much better short or a series of quick internet webisodes.Obviously every Bruce Campbell fan should check this out, I mean if you sat through Alien Apocalypse just for Bruce Campbell, then you can definitely make it through this.  You may find it funny, humor is subjective, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  I think if Bruce Campbell were going to spoof himself, it would have been funnier if they didn't use the whole supernatural element.  Just have him be that wise cracker ""Ash"" in everyday life, telling off Hollywood Execs, hitting on young drunk celebrities, punching out the paparazzi and ordering his legion of fans to take out Shatner's legion of fans.

K,"[6, 6]","MY NAME IS BRUCE****  Out of 5Release Date- October 31st, 2008Running Time- 84-MinutesRating- RScreenplay- Mark VerheidenDirector- Bruce CampbellStarring- Bruce Campbell, Grace Thorsen, Taylor Sharpe, Ben L. McCain with Ellen Sandweiss and Ted RaimiTo your average film fan being a B-movie actor may not sound like a big deal, but what some people fail to realize is that for every Brad Pitt you have a whole slew of B-actors and for every B-actor you have people who never go further than being an extra or simply starring in short films made by friends. And the same goes for writers and directors. Fact is Bruce Campbell has gone further in his career than most people do who get involved in film. But who knew back when the Evil Dead came out that it would make Bruce Campbell a cult Icon. Of all the cult actors or filmmakers none have reached the status of Bruce Campbell; he is by far the definition of cult Icon.There's a lot of praise among Bruce Campbell fans for My Name Is Bruce and some might wonder is it really that good? The answer is without a doubt yes it really is that good. Sure there are some Bruce Campbell fanboys who will blindly praise anything he does and everyone in film or music or whatever has someone like that who just praises them no matter what. I'm as big of a fan of Bruce Campbell as you'll find, but that doesn't mean I have to like everything he has done; and let's be honest here over the past couple of years his films haven't been as good with the exception of Bubba Ho-Tep, but My Name Is Bruce again shows why Campbell has legion of fans.The screenplay by Mark Verheiden is excellent; My Name Is Bruce is a B-movie and Verheiden never tries to make it more than that. He knows what kind of movie he's writing and he writes one great screenplay. The movie is always funny in a silly way and that is what this movie is all about. I wasn't sure what to expect from the script, but it was very funny and smart, but always stays true to what it is.Besides starring and producing, Bruce Campbell also directs and while he's not exactly Sam Raimi, but in his own right Campbell proves to be just as talented behind the camera. The problem these days with cult cinema is filmmakers try too hard. A lot of those who grew up with cult movies of the 70s and 80s are now making their own films and the problem is can you really make a cult movie on purpose? Grindhouse by Quentin Tarantino & Robert Rodriguez was excellent, and while they did make a cult flick, but at times that's the problem, but they got it right where most filmmakers failed.With My Name Is Bruce, Bruce Campbell sets out to make a B-movie and he gets it right 100%. The pacing of the movie is excellent with never once a dull moment. From beginning, middle to end, My Name Is Bruce is always fun and entertaining and never once will you be bored at all. Campbell sets out to make a cult flick and he delivers big time. Again he may not be Sam Raimi, but he clearly knows what he's doing and delivers one of the best cult movies of all time. I have no doubt in my mind My Name Is Bruce will be remembered by fans. The only reason I didn't give this the full 5-stars is the ending was kinda lame, but besides that this movie was amazing.Bruce Campbell plays an exaggerated version of himself and this is by far his best performance in years! My Name Is Bruce in my opinion is easily in his top 5 performances. Bruce really is an underrated actor and what I love about him is he's not afraid to ham it up and make a fool out of himself on camera and here Bruce was brilliant! Bottom line is this; no actor can deliver a one liner like Bruce can and here he has plenty of them. Actually this may be in his top 3 performances rather than top 5.Every year actors get snubbed on an Oscar nomination, but my question is what happened to Bruce's nomination? All kidding aside this was a brilliant performance. Bruce made me laugh and cry when he sees the error of his ways. Ok so maybe I didn't cry, but seriously his performance was amazing. Ted Raimi also stars and plays 3 different roles and he was amazing in all 3. I just love seeing Bruce and Ted together again in a movie. These two really work so well together.My Name Is Bruce is strictly for Bruce Campbell fans I suppose if you don't know who Bruce is you might get some enjoyment, but odds are not much. But if you are a fan of the cult Icon that is Bruce Campbell buy this movie right away!As for the Blu-ray; while the picture quality is solid at times you can notice the low budget, but I've read some negative reviews on the quality and I don't think it's fair. Granted this may not be the best Blu-ray out on the market, but it's still pretty good. I bought this here on Amazon and at the time it was only $1 more for the Blu-ray so it was more than worth it. The features are solid and are the same as the Blu-ray.",5,Hail to the B-movie King,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,4879,"['NAME', 'IS', 'BRUCE****', 'Out', '5Release', 'Date-', 'October', '31st',

1207589,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001KEGR5M,David J. Brown,"[1, 2]","*** 1/2 to be precise.  ---I don't do plot synopsis, Amazon's handled that one for us all already----I first heard about this film's production three and half years ago.  I thought it was great idea!  Bruce Campbell playing himself, or at least an over-the-top version of himself, and facing off against a real evil.  It basically plays like The Three Amigos: well known and down and out cult actor gets recruited by fan, who thinks he would actually know about fighting monsters, to fight a monster awakened in said kids town.  It's perfect and fun and goofy little set-up---more so if you love or just like Bruce Campbell.I love Bruce.  I grew up with his with flicks like the Evil Dead trilogy, Maniac Cop, and the great and sorrowfully cancelled show The Adventures Of Briscoe County Jr.  If you're not a fan of Bruce you will have some trouble settling down into this picture.  I can't lie, this is no crowd pleaser.  This is a fan pleaser, and it may not 100% please them.The jokes are broad, REALLY BROAD, just one notch below Airplane.  The first hour or so clips along filled with in-jokes and broad humor of the Three Stooges variety, and Bruce's special brand of mugging.  The puns are corny, and the writers and director(Bruce Campbell himself) know they are, and that's why they work.  They're not selling the jokes as legitimate humor, but more as so-corny that it's funny because it's not.  Make sense?The film has a small budget, but you really can't tell.  How could you?  The whole premise is for the film to look low budget.  The main demon that the town must fight is made-to-look-on-purpose exactly like a guy wearing a monster suit.  The suit is decent, the mask is funny, and apparently makes expressions.  The acting is perfectly over the top for the material.  Even the love interest, who is given the role of straight man, gets some yucks and physical comedy in.  Fan-boys will get joy-joy feelings with cameos from Ellen Sandweis(Evil Dead), Ted Raimi in three roles, and two other back up players from Evil Dead II and Army Of Darkness(won't tell which ones, it's part of the fun when they appear).  Ted Raimi plays an old Chinese man, last living decendent of the Chinese miners, named Wing.  He is an over the top stereotype but the film is so in-offenssive, anyone getting upset by the usual 'W's replacing 'R's in his speech, is far too sensative for life, and seriously needs to get a hobby.  The make-up on this character is very good too.The problems with this film come from the weak ending, and a villain that isn't well defined or particularly interesting.  The third act goes off into a Looney Tunes tone that the previous material didn't really have.  Which is all fine, but if the villain had more of personality beyond just showing up and lopping off heads and limbs, this could've worked as a give and take kind of thing.  The demon in the picture should've been given more of a voice, more comedy, and more of a hard presence in the film over all.  The only time we get something quirky from the demon***MILD SPOILER*** is when we find out that he is not only the guardian of the dead but the guardian of bean curd(yes, you heard me right).  This is silly, but in context with the rest of the film.  There's a great scene where the villain gets to be kind of goofy---it involves him salvaging thrown containers of bean curd.  The scene reminds me of of that stupid scene in Leprechuan with the shoes.***END OF SPOILERS***  The only other issue I had with the film is the 'why's behind the town hiring Bruce Campbell.  The kid who is a fan is in his teens, and should know the difference between reality and fiction, but still thinks Bruce would know how to fight off the demon.  Okay, maybe he's just the supidest teen alive.  But, what about the rest of the town.  Why would they agree to this?  Why would they want a 'b' movie star to kill their demon?  What other options did they try first?  Maybe I'm nit-picking, but this could've been funny.  We get some fun stuff about how Bruce buys into the premise initially, but not the town's people.  The script just glosses over this plot hole and never looks back.So if you're already a member of the Bruce cult you'll love seeing him ham-it up and poke fun at his image and career, and play himself as an over-drinking, sex crazy louse.  If not, you're simply going to find this comedy mediocre.  Horror fans will enjoy their icon, and others will wonder why the guy from Burn Notice and Hercules is doing such a corny movie.I liked it and recommend it to horror historians and Bruce-philes, but modern horror fans be warned, THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM.  Despite some graphic killings, which are quick and mild, and the supernatural theme, there is nothing remotely horror about this film, and the makers never intended there to be.  It's just their muse happened to be a horror icon.LATER",4,"Alan Lad meets The Three Amigos meets Bruce Campbell, of course!",1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,4883,"['***', '1/2', 'be', 'precise', '-I',

Though he's a favorite of mine, I don't make a study of his plans, his overall career or his future. I know him best from ARMY OF DARKNESS, an all-time B classic that somehow transcended the 'B'. I saw him a few times on TV in his ""The Adventures of Briscoe County, Jr."" and I think I saw him twice on ""Xena"" and ""Hercules"" as some sort of Robin Hood.MY NAME IS BRUCE is a strange object: it's a B-film that is almost pure comedy. There is some gore that is strangely funny; Campbell, who plays ""himself"", is still at his funniest though the script was a clear rush job. Still I have to say it made me laugh a lot more than most films I've seen since THE PROPOSAL (see my review).In brief, Bruce plays himself as a loudmouthed, selfish swine in a downward spiral--quite hilarious since it is, well, Bruce. He lives like a pig in a trailer with a dog as drunken as he often is, and Ted Raimi, appearing in three roles here (I won't even bother to mention the others) plays Bruce's horrific agent. It is a clever skewering of the whole industry The Raimis and Campbell pioneered.Some California boneheads release a Chinese demon from a collapsed mine that is located in the dead center of the local cemetery--and one intrepid teen boy decides to kidnap Bruce in order to get help for the town. Had they laid off the inbred hillbilly routine here, it might have come off better.What I loved most is that Bruce looks good, typically middle-aged, a hint of a potbelly and hair obviously dyed. I recall when he looked 90 years old and very grey...that was when he had a regular role (Jeff) on the old, old Ellen DeGeneres TV series. His comic appeal is still brilliant, as he takes the typical stale stuff and turns it hilarious by his mere performance.This is not a bad 80 minutes to spend on a movie: I have seen a lot worse these days, huge budget crap that doesn't stand up to this film. This is an amusing lampoon of Campbell, his fans and the storylines of his films. They don't even try to be serious here...except for the frightening appearance by Sam Raimi, with poor Ted sitting next to him like a cowering statue.Get this and have fun; it's no EVIL DEAD, no ARMY OF DARKNESS and it's no heavyweight--but it's funny as hell.",3,"""Mr. Campbell makes soup...""",1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,2288,"['always', 'been', 'tough', 'figure', 'out', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'favorite', 'mine', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'study', 'plans', 'overall', 'career', 'future', 'know', 'best', 'ARMY', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'all-time', 'B', 'classic', 'somehow', 'transcended', 'B', 'saw', 'few', 'times', 'TV', 'Adventures', 'Briscoe', 'County', 'Jr.', 'think', 'saw', 'twice', 'Xena', 'Hercules', 'sort', 'Robin', 'Hood.MY', 'NAME', 'IS', 'BRUCE', 'strange', 'object', 'B-film', 'almost', 'pure', 'comedy', 'gore', 'strangely', 'funny', 'Campbell', 'who', 'still', 'funniest', 'script', 'was', 'clear', 'rush', 'job', 'Still', 'have', 'say', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'most', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'PROPOSAL', 'see', 'review', '.In', 'brief', 'Bruce', 'loudmouthed', 'selfish', 'swine', 'downward', 'spiral', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'well', 'Bruce', 'pig', 'trailer', 'dog', 'as', 'drunken', 'often', 'Ted', 'Raimi', 'appearing', 'three', 'roles', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'mention', 'others', 'Bruce', 'horrific', 'agent', 'clever', 'skewering', 'whole', 'industry', 'Raimis', 'Campbell', 'pioneered.Some', 'California', 'boneheads', 'release', 'Chinese', 'demon', 'collapsed', 'mine', 'located', 'dead', 'center', 'local', 'cemetery', 'one', 'intrepid', 'teen', 'boy', 'kidnap', 'Bruce', 'order', 'get', 'help', 'town', 'Had', 'laid', 'off', 'inbred', 'hillbilly', 'routine', 'here', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'loved', 'most', 'Bruce', 'good', 'typically', 'middle-aged', 'hint', 'potbelly', 'hair', 'obviously', 'dyed', 'recall', 'when', 'looked', '90', 'years', 'old', 'very', 'grey', 'was', 'when', 'had', 'regular', 'role', 'Jeff', 'old', 'old', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'TV', 'series', 'comic', 'appeal', 'still', 'brilliant', 'typical', 'stale', 'stuff', 'hilarious', 'mere', 'performance.This', 'not', 'bad', '80', 'minutes', 'spend', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'worse', 'days', 'huge', 'budget', 'crap', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'film', 'amusing', 'lampoon', 'Campbell', 'fans', 'storylines', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'be', 'serious', 'here', 'frightening', 'appearance', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'poor', 'Ted', 'sitting', 'next', 'cowering', 'statue.Get', 'have', 'fun', 'EVIL', 'DEAD', 'ARMY', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'heavyweight', 'funny', 'hell']",N/A

1207597,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001KEGR5M,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 2]","MY NAME IS BRUCEOf course any one who knows me or has read any of my reviews knows that I am a huge Bruce Campbell fan, can't help it any thing he is apart of I will buy. So of course I was ready and waiting when this marvelous piece of filmmaking came out [I know I know, I am a fan boy]. Naturally after having a whole weekend of a great Bruce Campbell marathon I was still ready for this movie as was every one around me, of course I now realize that every time a movie comes out or we have some MMA going on I always pay for it. Also every one seems to come to my house and eat up everything; I need to switch this up some time. Any way we all headed back to my house as soon as I purchased this and loaded up with drinks and started the flick, good times.As I expected this was a really fun film that any and every fan of Bruce would more than enjoy, plenty of inside jokes through out the movie, that marathon right before this helped immensely on that front. The way he mixed his real life with his fictional character was brilliant, even the fake movies in the film he talks about seem like they would great. The story is as follows, are you ready? We open with a couple of teens going to the local cemetery looking to have a good time together, one of these kids happens to be the worlds biggest Bruce fan, I disagree whole heartedly but that is neither here nor there. After being turned down or something like that he wanders off and finds a medallion connected to some door on a tomb, of course he grabs it and rips it off the door. From here our villain Guan-Di emerges and begins to take the kids out one by one, he protects the souls that rest there and also just happens to be the Chinese god of war. Off away in Hollywood we join Bruce on the set of his new film, ""Cave Alien 2"", sounds Bruce fantastic. After leaving the set one day and going to his house Bruce is knocked out and kidnapped and wakes up in a small country town, the town were the demon moves amongst the living. Bruce thinks that this is all set up by his manager so he plays along like nothing is wrong, that is until that he comes face to face with a real demon. From there all bets are off as Bruce must find the real hero in him that he played for so long to beat this thing.I have to say right now that this is a very funny movie and Bruce is wonderful as a meaner version of him self. As always his comedic timing is second to none as he hits every line perfectly with that wonderful wit and charisma. I love the fact the film while riddled with inside jokes that only fans will get is also a great watch for the average viewer. This film is very funny and you don't have to have seen his other works to appreciate it. Of course for those of us that have seen his previous directorial feature ""Man With The Screaming Brain"" can tell you that this is visually and over all a better movie. Of course that film was made for TV, the Sci-Fi Channel to be exact, this movie did not have to edit its self for made for TV fair. As for the directing Bruce did a great job as the film does not feel like it slows down and the pace keeps to a good speed, taking breaks only when appropriate. Mark Verheiden's script is amazing and was the perfect choice for Bruce's next film, very funny stuff that had a great performer as well. Bruce also served as producer along side Mike Richardson who produced such films as ""AVP, Hellboy 2, and 30 Days of Night"", so this film had a great tam behind it.Acting wise there are some great performances like Campbell's but others give your typical b level performances, which was great. Bruce of course was great but so was Grace Thorsen as Kelly and Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl [the same from Evil Dead]. Taylor Sharpe as Jeff did a good job as did Ben McCain as the major of the town, as a matter of fact every one played their parts very well, especially the 2 guys who played the gay guys [they were very funny]. Still besides Bruce the show stealer was none other then the great Ted Raimi who played three roles ala Eddie Murphy, all were great as expected. Ted was very believable and funny as Bruce's manager Mills Toddner and was really funny as the sign painter, who was named Ted. Then there was his Chinese character Wing who claimed to be in control of the demon, see how that worked out.This was a great movie that was very funny especially after watching all of those Bruce related films and TV shows before this one came out. To all Bruce fans you probably already own this but to those who don't you are missing out. And to those who are just casual movie goers this one can also be for you, it is really funny and Bruce provides a funny performance. Also all you movie buffs like myself will love the DVD, it is loaded beyond belief with special features. First off we get a great audio commentary from the man himself Bruce Campbell and producer Mike Richardson as well as a great behind the scenes making of feature. There also a lot of features like ""Bruce on"" my personal favorites ""Kif's Kornor, and awkward moments with Kif"" as well as many others. There are also trailers and gallery's but the best thing is that there are multiple hidden eggs on every screen you can get on, and I mean every screen.This is a wonderful DVD that all should own and by own I mean buy not burn, and forget rentals, this is a keeper.",5,LIKE I SAID BRUCE CAMPBELL+TED RAIMI WILL ALWAYS = BRILLIANCE,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,5351,"['NAME', 'IS', 'BRUCEOf',

Second, Campbell's book, ""If Chins Could Kill,"" was great, providing juicy low-budget movie-production tidbits along with Campbellian humor.  That being said, let's get to the movie.The movie was entertaining and served, basically, as a vehicle through which to view Bruce doing his usual thing: delivering snappy lines, making funny faces, being rejected by women, making a low-budget movie.

I mean, they have him living in a trailer in the movie and any fan of Bruce Campbell's KNOWS that THAT isn't true, which really shouldn't matter but, somehow, it does, thereby undermining the credibility of the storyline (not that it's that credible to begin with, mind you).

What's offered up as humor is lame at best, with precious little best. The Concept of spoofing the spoof horror film genre is intriguing, but...Just scanned the reviews before deciding whether to keep watching 'Bruce'.  Apparently there's nothing Campbell could say or do that wouldn't get a five star rating from his fan base, which is scary. OTOH, he seems personable and intelligent in real life, plus I like his taste in women, judging by those actresses seen so far. The 'ex-wife' was not only hot, but did fine work with the few lines she was given.To press on, or not?Okay, I'll give it to two stars. A  couple of running gags eventually grew mildly funny,  but mainly because the female lead and supporting actors made their characters interesting despite the negative waves Campbell incessantly radiated by ridiculing his onscreen persona (chugging urine, vigorous nose-mining), the movie, the genre, and by implication his hardcore fans - a fact lost on most of his hardcore fans, it seems.As for the screenplay, even if time or money precluded anything more than minor alterations to the script in hand, there were tons of possibilities for improvements. A better option would have been to chuck that turkey whole hog, instead drawing from countless spec horror scripts, modified to fit the Concept. For instance, one of my screenplays that's been gathering dust for years, The Hoodoo, would have served well not only because it can be made CHEAP (seven character total), but is set in the Oregon Cascades, figuratively within sight of Campbell's Jacksonville ranch!",2,On the fly review of 'Bruce',1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,1677,"['25', 'minutes', 'flick', ""'m"", 'sorely', 'tempted', 'bail', 'Calling', 'schlock', 'far', 'too', 'generous', 'What', 'offered', 'up', 'humor', 'lame', 'best', 'precious', 'little', 'best', 'Concept', 'spoofing', 'spoof', 'horror', 'film', 'genre', 'intriguing', 'Just', 'scanned', 'reviews', 'deciding', 'keep', 'watching', ""'Bruce"", 'Apparently', 'nothing', 'Campbell', 'could', 'say', 'do', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'fan', 'base', 'scary', 'OTOH', 'personable', 'intelligent', 'real', 'life', 'taste', 'women', 'judging', 'actresses', 'seen', 'so', 'far', ""'ex-wife"", 'was', 'not', 'only', 'hot', 'did', 'fine', 'work', 'few', 'lines', 'was', 'given.To', 'press', 'not', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'couple', 'running', 'gags', 'eventually', 'grew', 'mildly', 'funny', 'mainly', 'female', 'lead', 'supporting', 'actors', 'made', 'characters', 'interesting', 'negative', 'waves', 'Campbell', 'incessantly', 'radiated', 'ridiculing', 'onscreen', 'persona', 'chugging', 'urine', 'vigorous', 'nose-mining', 'movie', 'genre', 'implication', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'fact', 'lost', 'most', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'screenplay', 'even', 'time', 'money', 'precluded', 'anything', 'more', 'minor', 'alterations', 'script', 'hand', 'were', 'tons', 'possibilities', 'improvements', 'better', 'option', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'chuck', 'turkey', 'whole', 'hog', 'instead', 'drawing', 'countless', 'spec', 'horror', 'scripts', 'modified', 'fit', 'Concept', 'instance', 'one', 'screenplays', 'been', 'gathering', 'dust', 'years', 'Hoodoo', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'well', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'CHEAP', 'seven', 'character', 'total', 'set', 'Oregon', 'Cascades', 'figuratively', 'sight', 'Campbell', 'Jacksonville', 'ranch']",N/A

Denick,"[0, 0]","As mid October rolls around, brisk winds sweep through the crisp autumn air, jack o'lanterns decorate steps and porches, the scent of wood smoke radiates from wood stoves, and the leaves are in their peak season of color. October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are ""alternative"" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!It needs to be mentioned that in order to get maximum enjoyment out of this movie, you will probably need to be a fan of Bruce Campbell, widely considered to be the King of B-Movies. Otherwise, I'd imagine you might be quite confused. However, for those of us who ARE fans (and since this movie was not widely released, I'd imagine you know who he is if you've found ""My Name Is Bruce""), then this flick is a pure delight. It's hilarious to watch Bruce Campbell spoof on his own person, his bizarre (and very cool) career, and his legion of (oftentimes irrational) fans.I had the opportunity to meet Bruce Campbell at an event at which he spoke, and he was the most patient, respectful, and down to earth gentlemen. His anecdotes were hilarious, his wit was sharp, and the way he dealt with his fans was admirable. ""My Name Is Bruce"" does a great job of paying homage to his career, while playfully spoofing at the perceptions that have slowly formed about him as the years pass by, his bio lengthens, and his legend grows.",5,"""It's just you and me, Top Ramen!""",1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,1643,"['mid', 'October', 'rolls', 'around', 'brisk', 'winds', 'sweep', 'crisp', 'autumn', 'air', 'jack', ""o'lanterns"", 'decorate', 'steps', 'porches', 'scent', 'wood', 'smoke', 'wood', 'stoves', 'leaves', 'are', 'peak', 'season', 'color', 'October', 'magnificent', 'month', 'celebration', 'annual', 'visit', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'review', 'few', 'great', 'flicks', 'Halloween', 'season', 'titles', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'review', 'are', 'alternative', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'not', 'classics', 'generally', 'spring', 'mind', 'fun', 'movies', 'elements', 'supernatural', 'Just', 'good', 'lighthearted', 'stuff', 'here', 'nothing', 'gory', 'scary', 'least', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'mentioned', 'order', 'get', 'maximum', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'need', 'be', 'fan', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'King', 'B-Movies', 'Otherwise', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'might', 'be', 'quite', 'confused', 'However', 'who', 'ARE', 'fans', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'widely', 'released', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'know', 'who', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Name', 'Bruce', 'then', 'flick', 'pure', 'delight', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'spoof', 'own', 'person', 'bizarre', 'very', 'cool', 'career', 'legion', 'oftentimes', 'irrational', 'fans.I', 'had', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'event', 'spoke', 'was', 'most', 'patient', 'respectful', 'down', 'earth', 'gentlemen', 'anecdotes', 'were', 'hilarious', 'wit', 'was', 'sharp', 'way', 'fans', 'was', 'admirable', 'Name', 'Bruce', 'great', 'job', 'paying', 'homage', 'career', 'playfully', 'spoofing', 'perceptions', 'have', 'slowly', 'formed', 'about', 'years', 'pass', 'bio', 'legend', 'grows']",N/A

Kudos to USA for hiring him for Burn Notice. The humor in this movie is right on you really have to pay attention or you will miss a lot of it.

1207604,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001KEGR5M,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","- A character in this film: ""Bruce Campbell is the greatest actor of his generation!""You have to be a fan of the dude. Because, to anyone else, MY NAME IS BRUCE probably comes off a lame picture. But if you're in on the joke, then trashy campy fun time could be had. Skewering his B-movie street creds as he does, Bruce Campbell in this movie isn't about to go all Denzel or Sir Laurence Olivier. He's the same goofy wiseacre action hero, and impeccable acting doesn't fly out the window as much as it is defenestrated.The Chinese believe there is a god of everything. In the dying mining town of Gold Lick, Oregon (population 339, and fast declining), teenagers prowl a decrepit graveyard and unwittingly set loose the murderous hellspawn Guan-Di, who has ties to the one hundred Chinese miners who back in the 1870s perished in a mine shaft collapse. This being that kind of movie, Guan-Di, who is the Chinese God of War, the Protector of the Dead, and the Patron Saint of Bean Curd, is rendered so very cheesily on screen that there's no way he could scare anyone. Still, the demon doesn't waste time going on a killing spree, chopping off heads, rapidly reducing Gold Lick's population like it was Bruce Campbell's dignity. Desperate times call for blah blah blah. One teenager has seen all of Bruce Campbell's mostly schlocky flicks and a lightbulb comes on.So, apparently, in ""real life,"" Bruce Campbell is mean, bitter, boozy, lily-livered and dwells in a ramshackle trailer. And he treats his fans worse than Shatner treats Star Trek enthusiasts. Fresh off shooting scenes for CAVEALIEN 2 and quaffing down urine, Bruce is talked into helping out the hapless folks of Gold Lick, if by ""talked into"" it's meant that he gets bonked on the head, dumped in the trunk of a car and shanghaied to Gold Lick to play savior. Once there, Bruce gets his wires crossed and, stemming from a conversation with his agent, assumes that this whole mess is play acting put on for his birthday. So Bruce goes along, preening and lording it over the small town rubes and waxing rhapsodic on his demonslaying skills. Until he learns that Guan-Di is an honest-to-gosh demon who doesn't give a fig about his birthday.So it's a slim to none shot that the high-falutin' folks from Merchant Ivory will call for Bruce Campbell's services any time soon, even if Bruce does look damn dashing in those Old Spice ads. MY NAME IS BRUCE is more in his wheelhouse, just the type of thing to make his fans happy, and it probably doesn't matter too much to them that this film doesn't rise above its genre, is in fact steeped in cheesy horror cliches, beginning with the one about the randy teens (a.k.a. soon-to-be-victims) angling for booty call. This film really does ride on the strength of the fans' long-standing affection for the mighty-chinned one. MY NAME IS BRUCE features a Bruce Campbell who slings profanity and shamelessly insults everyone, and because it's this guy who's mugging on camera, I relish it. Regarding the portrayal of his pathetic ""real life"" self, he out Bob Hopes Bob Hope in terms of yellow-streaked shenanigans and snarky meta-referential barbs. It's totally un-p.c. but I couldn't help laughing when Bruce's bump of self-preservation has him wrestling old ladies out of cars and shoving little kids off their bicycles.Not to be taken too seriously, the dvd's bonus features are: the feature commentary with Bruce Campbell (who also directed the movie) and producer Mike Richardson; ""Heart of Dorkness"" - the hour-long Making Of featurette; 2 awkward conversational moments with 'Kif' (Craig 'Kif' Sanborn is the film's associate producer); Bruce On... - Bruce waxes philosophical on sundry (and uninteresting) topics: wildlife, budgets, etc.; a fake trailer to CAVEALIEN 2; Beyond Inside the Cave: The fake Making Of featurette on CAVEALIEN 2; Kif's Korner - Kif chats about the film's graphic artwork, mostly concerning the posters promoting Bruce's fake films within the film; the Hard Truth - a playful expos&eacute; on What Bruce Is Really Like (or as one crew member says: ""I don't know what Bruce is like off-set. I could ask my wife.""); Love Birds - a minute spent with the hick farmer and his gunshop owner ; Poster Art Gallery; Props Art Gallery; Photo Gallery; and the MY NAME IS BRUCE trailer. There's also a mini comic book adapted from the movie.If you've enjoyed Bruce Campbell in his other roles (Ash, Bubba Ho-tep, Autolycus: King of Thieves, Brisco County, Jr., etc.), this is simply more of the same antics. But the extra fun here is in catching all the in-jokes and references. So keep the tongue planted firmly in cheek and go fix yourself a ham and cheese sandwich - but heavy on the ham! - as a seedy, jerky B-movie icon learns valuable life lessons about decency, respect and even love - that is, when he's not weaseling and yellow-bellying his way out of ridiculous scrapes.",4,"""You don't like Bruce, you walk!""",1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,4903,"['character',

1207605,A1J5TC13BSPA2M,B001KEGR5M,"James Simpson ""James Simpson""","[0, 1]","Bruce Campbell is one of the few actors who really knows how to handle a B-Movie formula well. He knows when to play it seriously and when to inject tongue in cheek humor. He's the kind of actor who can effortlessly steal and/or make many a bad film. In this self produced parody of himself, Bruce yet again, is very enjoyable and able to deliver the laughs, but never rises above the material.The plot is about how Bruce, playing himself, is kidnapped by a crazy young fan who wants him to protect his town from an ancient demon. Bruce thinks it's a joke until he comes face to face with the Monster and turns tail, only to come back and predictably take the creature on. It's very reminiscent of the film,""Galaxy Quest"", except unlike that film, this one loses focus pretty early on.Campbell's character is a gross parody of himself and is made out as an arrogant, loveable jerk. The problem is that he never believably progresses throughout the course of the picture. The climatic encounter with the main demon does not even take place until the final half hour(!) and than he returns in the last fifteen minutes to battle the demon, and never is is believable that he got to that point as a character because Bruce is playing a CARIACTURE. Now perhaps this is missing the point, but it seems a shame that the film could not go beyond the films it's parodying, becoming yet another movie where Campbell is the only thing going for it, everything else failing miserably. That's the problem here. It never becomes anything else than just another B-movie. And what a shame!The DVD features are fairly entertaining including mock trailers for the film within a film, ""Cavealien 2"" which is funny and some behind the scenes footage of Bruce that is very humorous. There's even a documentary about the film.It's a harmless enough movie and a must for B-movie and Bruce fans everywhere(areen't they one in the same?) and well worth a viewing, but does not stand up under multiple viewings like the best B-movies.Note:Ted Raimi is in this.

Having read the Dark Horse comic book that was created to parallel it, I wasn't expecting much--the humor in the film relies completely on the delivery of its hero the one and only Bruce Campbell, which is something that simply doesn't translate to the printed word.The plot is simple: teenagers accidentally raise the Chinese god of war (and bean curd) Guan Di and one of them (a devout fan of Campbell's) decides to enlist him to battle the monstrous killing machine and when Campbell isn't interested, the teenager kidnaps him. Campbell thinks its all part of an elaborate birthday present from his agent (played by Ted Raimi), sort of a chance to live out his screen persona in a role playing game, and decides to go along with the gag and have some fun. He quickly learns that this Monster is all too real and he runs for his life leaving the town in the lurch and his teenaged fan disillusioned. Will Campbell turn out to be a cad or will he become a REAL life and not just a REEL life hero?Campbell (who made his directorial debut in THE MAN WITH THE SCREAMING BRAIN) is also at the helm in this flick which was written by Mark Verheiden of Dark Horse Comics and he does it with surprising panache. He is not the least bit reticent about portraying the fictional Bruce Campbell as a washed up 3rd rate actor who's an alcholic, womanizing, creep with little respect for himself or anyone else for that matter. The special features on the DVD are even better than the film itself and are totally enjoyable. This is a must for every Bruce Campbell fan. As for the rest of you, why aren't you Bruce Campbell fans?The extras on the DVD are even better than the film--and just as long too.

Mostly known for the Evil Dead trilogy and Bubba Ho-Tep, his other films have been mostly forgettable b-movies but he has developed into one of the biggest cult actors of all-time.  If you've already read his autobiography ""If chins could kill"" and feel like you need even more Bruce, this movie will be a godsend.Plot: A group of teenagers, among them one who is a hopeless Campbell fanatic, unwittingly unleash an evil spirit, after messing around in a graveyard at night.  Turns out they have unleashed Gu-An Di, an ancient Chinese protector of the dead.  The small town of Gold Lick is thus under the hold of this ancient evil.  So who do they call for help?  Well, Bruce Campbell of course.  Yes, the real Bruce Campbell!  But as the town folk will soon find out, the real Bruce Campbell is not quite as adept with a ""Boomstick"" as he is in his films.It seems like Bruce, who happens to also be the director of this film, is taking a special pleasure in not only mocking himself, but also his obsessive fanbase as well.  In this film, he makes his fans out to be as obsessive and abhorrent as the worst of the Star Trek fanatics can be.  When this film is funny, it's really funny.  Bruce is in fine comic form throughout.  But in typical B-Movie fashion, when this movie tries to be funny but fails (usually scenes that do not have Bruce in it) it falls flat on its face.It's a bit hard to give a ranking to a film like this.  Should I rank this as a Bruce Campbell fan, or on its own merits as a stand-alone movie?  I opt for the former because I figure Campbell fans are basically the only ones that would seek this out anyway.  For his fans, this has it all: Campbell playing an exaggerated version of himself as a trailer-park, divorced, boozing, sleazy and jerk womanizer who spits out the cheesy lines we've all gotten so used to hearing from him.

His Evil Dead and other such movies are bigger budget flicks, but this one was made on a pretty minimal budget. I've read that it was even shot on a set built on his own property, and he hired lots of locals for cast and crew. Pretty damn cool I say. It all seems to work here, and I mention the budget to set expectations, and not to detract from the movie otherwise. Bruce fans will enjoy it because of his many self-deprecating digs at himself, and they'll get the inside references to his past movies. ""Boomstick"", ""chainsaw"", ""blacksmith"", etc. all get worked into the movie. Viewers not familiar with his work should probably see, at least, ""Evil Dead"", ""Evil Dead 2"" and ""Army of Darkness"" movies before seeing this one.

Ok, on the regular scale of movies this would make some movie watchers dismiss this as a low budget horror comedy. I don't think that you have to be a Bruce C fan to enjoy his self parody of a fallen star who is gets some redemption from his disgusting lifestyle.  Bruce has always been able to inject comedy into his movies but this time it's the reason for this movie.  There are some people in the film industry that are as loathsome and self destructive as the character that bruce protrays here.  But's It's not a true picture of the real Bruce C. This character is a total washout as a human being until  he finds redemptionand courage due to bravery of one of the characters fans.This movie is over the top and everything is played to the comedic except of course for bloody violence that is done by the bean curd protecting monster. And Bruce who has done alot of roles that had no campy element in them does excel in this type of comedic role. So this only shows that the man can excel in either field.  This movie looks excellent on blu ray so this is the superiorversion to have.

I've been following his career ever since I traumatized my friends with a showing of the first Evil Dead (the one that's not nearly as funny as Evil Dead II and kind of squicky). We watched Evil Dead II and went to the movies to see Army of Darkness.  We were very confused because the tone shifted from one of disturbing horror to slapstick humor to total comedy.  And thus we were indoctrinated into what The Man does best: slapstick horror.On the DVD of Army of Darkness, Campbell shares his thoughts on Ashley Williams, the hero of the series and Campbell's alter ego.  He wanted him to hide in a closet at the end of the film, revealing that he was really a coward.  Campbell never had much respect for Ash, but the character has been conflated with the actor on more than one occasion. If you've read If Chins Could Kill, you know that Campbell's a working actor whose pay doesn't exceed $80K most years - although I hope that's changed since his debut on the excellent Burn Notice.  My Name is Bruce combines the Man, the Myth, and the Legend into one hilariously self-referential movie.The Bruce Campbell of My Name is Bruce is a boozy, womanizing no-talent hack who hates his coworkers, his fans, and life in general. In other words, he's Ash at the end of Army of Darkness.The Raimis have always had a fondness for Asian cinema and the Asian influence extends even to My Name is Bruce in the form of Guan-Di, the Chinese god of war and bean curds.  Campbell is suckered into visiting the town threatened by Guan-Di, thinking it's a birthday present from his agent (Ted Raimi).  I'll be honest...I love Bruce, but I could really do without Ted.  Ted's the younger Raimi brother who's always tagging along.  While I have enormous respect for the literal horrors he faced in making Evil Dead II, Ted just isn't as talented as Bruce.In the midst of the endless in-jokes about Campbell, it becomes obvious that he is the best actor on the set.  Campbell has movie star charisma even if his movies aren't always up to snuff, and never has it been more abundantly clear that the man has talent than this ironic taken down of himself. The other actors just can't keep up - and in Ted's portrayal of an Asian, borders on offensive.The ending isn't really an ending so much as it's a meta-critique of movies in general.  Bruce directed this film so he can end it however he wants, and it ends just as he likes it - crazed, absurd, and violent.

When die hard Bruce Campbell fan Jeff (Taylor Sharpe) unwittingly unleashes a decapitation-happy Chinese demon (James J.

Loaded with in-jokes aplenty, appearances from many Evil Dead series vets (including Ted Raimi in three roles), and some great physical comedy from Campbell, My Name is Bruce is frequently funny and makes the most out of its running time.  Though there are times when its small budget becomes apparent, My Name is Bruce is a fun blast that finds the Evil Dead icon in great form, and needless to say, this film is a must-see if you consider youself a Bruce Campbell fan in any way, shape, or form.

(laughs) who obviously saw the potential of the project and played along all the jokes, clich&eacute;s and stereotypes you can think of in a film like this.Here's the storyline: in a small Oregon town, a boy who happens to be Bruce Campbell's biggest fan unlocks a Chinese ghost who starts haunting the town while killing anything that moves. Bruce Campbell - a run down 3rd rate actor living in a trailer - is kidnapped by the towns people who beg for his help (misguided by the notion that he can actually fight the evil forces). Thinking it is all a big joke by fans, Bruce plays along until he discovers the ghost is indeed real.What I find most interesting is that Bruce Campbell plays a FICTIONAL version of Bruce Campbell... one whose career is a joke, who lives in a trailer and drinks bourbon from the dog's plate. In that sense, Bruce plays a fascinating (and hilarious) spoof on Hollywood Z-movie actors.Most jokes are solid and delightful to watch although many moments get less laughs than I hoped.The problem starts when the whole thing becomes too cartoonish that the whole screenplay derails into a final half hour that is a disaster unworthy of anything that came before. And that is sad because this whole project had everything to be a gem.In my opinion, the problem is with the screenplay that obviously was not developed enough... the ending is everything an ending should NOT be... and it left me speechless since the film deserved a lot better.Still, this is a film that is worth a look because it is always a joy to watch Bruce Campbell (who IS a great actor) joking about himself, his movies and Hollywood.",3,"GREAT IDEA, GREAT VEHICLE, NICE SCREENPLAY...

If you come into this movie without knowing who Bruce Campbell is then you will definitely be missing out on a lot of wink-wink-nudge-nudge, ""hey, wasn't that the blacksmith from AoD"" type of moments.Also bear in mind that this is a very ""B"" movie.But that said, I think this movie captures what it is that makes Bruce Campbell work so well, and why his movies have such a following:  He has captured the essence of Monty Python.  This is a sizable feat which very few actors have ever managed to do.We all know Monty Python.  We've seen the movies.  We know the lines.  We memorized the songs.  But I think it's easy to overlook how Monty Python became so popular and why those movies were so funny -- it's all in the surprise and the delivery.  To hear the clop clop of an approaching horse and see them come over the hill and it's actually just a guy clacking two coconuts together is funny because it's unexpected.  The argument between the peasants and the King delivered with a straight face is funny.  This is the essence of Monty Python style humor.And Bruce Campbell has managed to capture that.  It's why (in my opinion) Army of Darkness catapulted him into the spotlight and it's that sort of thing that makes ""My Name is Bruce"" work.This movie is like a continuation of the Monty Python brand of humor.That's big.

But he was part of my formative years thanks to Army of Darkness and The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. Really, if the MTV Movie Awards were still hip and relevant, they would have giving him, or at the very least Ash, the Lifetime Achievement Award.It is the cult like following that is the basis of My Name Is Bruce where Campbell plays the title character, himself. His exaggerated version of himself is a callow, egomaniacal hack who is hated by his co-workers, his ex-wife, and his agent (Ted Raimi in one of his three roles). The only people that don't hate him are his legions of fans, but he's working on alienating them too. But it is one zealous fan who just so happened to unleash the Chinese war deity Guan Di that figures the one person that could help him would be the star of Evil Dead and Maniac Cop 2.But when the fan kidnaps Campbell, he goes along with it thinking it is an acting gig set up by his manager. And then the hilarity ensues. One drawback of My Name Is Bruce is the fake real life Bruce doesn't exactly live up to the humor or wit of his onscreen version like Ash. And you wish for more catchphrases that you come to expect from Bruce characters. But this movie makes up for it in the terms of musical numbers and has plenty of in-jokes for the hard core Bruce fans and a few cameos from Evil Dead alums.The big draw to the My Name Is Bruce DVD are the extra like the behind the scenes documentary that is almost as long as the movie itself.

They are low-budget (and Bruce is hardly poor as he's one of the original investors in Renaissance Pictures and owns a HUGE piece of land in Oregon, on which this film was mostly shot), trashy, badly written, unfunny and lacking in good special effects or ideas. In an attempt to make fun of his own past, Campbell has the characters repeat his lines from the ""Evil Dead"" and ""Army of Darkness"" again and again. The acting is dismal and Bruce comes off as his ""Ash"" character every time, only he's older and heftier and less funny each time.

Sure, like any actor he enjoys having fans, but as he's stated in his book and elsewhere that his fans can get a bit outrageous and push things far.  This seems to be what sparked My Name Is Bruce.  Here he pokes fun at his fandom as well as his career.In the film he plays Bruce Campbell, but a more fictional Bruce Campbell.  He's egocentric, a drunk, lives in a trailer, un-liked and un-respected by the cast and crew of his films, and just an all around jerk.  A teen in a small gold mining town called Gold Lick has mistakenly unleashed the ancient Chinese god of war, Guan-Di, and now the angry god is killing off the folks of Gold Lick.  The teen, Jeff, also happens to be a Bruce Campbell fanatic.  He manages to kidnap Campbell and bring him to Gold Lick where he has convinced the townspeople that Bruce will destroy the evil demon.  Bruce is under the impression that he's doing some kind of movie(it doesn't totally make sense why he'd think that he's in a movie when there's no film crew around or why the townspeople would believe that a horror movie actor could really be a ghost buster, but who cares?).  He goes coward when the reality of the situation becomes clear, but soon learns how to be the Bruce Campbell he's always portrayed himself to be.  I know what you're thinking!  My wife tapped my shoulder half way through the movie and said to me, ""this reminds me a lot of the Three Amigos"".  True, it's a very similar concept-the idea of egocentric actors finding themselves in real danger when they think they're only in ""reel"" danger, but in the end discover that they are heroes.Needless to say it is a fun movie.  Naturally we're dealing with a comedy here, not a horror film.  While the laughs are hit and miss, some of them predictable and a bit cliched, this movie really works because of Bruce.  We all know that Bruce has a helluva screen charisma and can singlehandedly carry practically any movie just off of his charm.  He also directed this movie.  It's low budget of course, and Bruce certainly makes the best of that.  He built the town of Gold Lick on his own property in Oregon.  The supporting cast is decent too, mostly unknowns.  Ted Raimi has multiple roles, each a different nationality, allowing him try multiple accents.  His Asian character just isn't funny though.  Too much of a stereotype Chinese guy.  He reminded me of Mickey Rooney in Breakfast At Tiffany's.It's great how Campbell makes fun of his fans and fandom, yet doesn't totally insult them.  He's also able to take potshots at himself and his career.  At one point he steals a kid's bike to get away from Guan-Di, and the kid yells at him, ""McHale's Navy sucked!!""  Funny stuff.  He really lays into his flop, Alien Apocalypse, but thinly disguises it here as a film called Cave Alien.  Plus there are many more in-jokes that you will definitely pick up on if you're familiar with many of Campbell's films.Campbell is touring the country right at the moment showing the film and doing 20-30 minutes Q&A; sessions after.  I'd highly suggest attending this if possible.  It's good support for Bruce as well as low budget cinema in general.  Plus the man is a treat to see and hear in person.

He's a rather stereotypical and shallow guy in this movie, an over-the-top B-grade actor more interested in scoring than being responsible for anything.It's a fun enough ride, a spoof of many of his B-grade movies with lots of inside jokes for the hard core B.C fans.

These episodes were made for the fans, to some extent, but had no depth of character, or story, they just kind of rambled on for 45 minutes, then ended.And that's about what you get here, 90 minutes of self indulgent rambling, with no real substance, and nothing new or cool to add to the, Bruce Campbell mythos.It's a real shame too, because the idea had so much potential for real comic genius, and a great bit of fun, but what they ended up making was a, ""Seen-it-all-before-and-done-better-in-other-films"" groaner.But hey, if you're the kind of person who thought that, The Man With The Screaming Brain, and/or, Alien Apocalypse, was this decades, Army Of Darkness, then you'll probably love this movie.Meanwhile, I'll be watching and waiting for someone to recognize Bruce's potential, and give him another great part, worthy of his comic genius (and this just happens to, ""NOT"" be that film, at least for me, anyway).",2,BIG FAN OF BRUCE (not so big fan of this movie :(,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,2445,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'just', 'state', 'record', 'am', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'fan', 'having', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'been', 'collection', 'yes', 'including', 'Man', 'Screaming', 'Brain', 'Alien', 'Apocalypse', 'think', 'guy', 'funny', 'said', 'was', 'REALLY', 'looking', 'forward', 'My', 'Name', 'Is', 'Bruce', 'even', 'paying', 'few', 'extra', 'bucks', 'procure', 'advanced', 'copy', 'official', 'DVD', 'release', 'sounded', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'Bruce', 'strut', 'stuff.The', 'problem', 'being', 'instead', 'great', 'parody', 'Bruce', 'life', 'la', 'William', 'Shatner', 'send', 'up', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'played', 'perfection', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'get', 'very', 'mediocre', 'film', 'Man', 'Screaming', 'Brain', 'play', 'Shakespeare.But', 'hey', 'guess', 'being', 'one', 'few', 'Bruce', 'fans', 'who', 'not', 'also', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'fan', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'anything', 'more', 'Stooges', 'mentality', 'mind', 'so', 'then', 'perhaps', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.But', 'said', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Stooges', 'fan', 'say', 'can', 'more', 'appreciate', 'good', 'bit', 'goofball', 'antics', 'problem', 'film', 'get', 'become', 'tiresome', 'very', 'fast.A', 'movie', 'good', 'script', 'hang', 'goofball', 'antics', 'even', 'script', 'goofball', 'ripping', 'off', 'Z', 'grade', 'sci-fi/horror', 'clich', 'eacute', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'writer', 'could', 'think', 'of.I', 'kind', 'liken', 'bad', 'episode', 'Hercules', 'know', 'ones', 'where', 'placed', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'gang', 'present', 'filler', 'episode', 'episodes', 'were', 'made', 'fans', 'extent', 'had', 'depth', 'character', 'story', 'just', 'kind', 'rambled', '45', 'minutes', 'then', 'what', 'get', 'here', '90', 'minutes', 'self', 'indulgent', 'rambling', 'real', 'substance', 'nothing', 'new', 'cool', 'add', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'mythos.It', 'real', 'shame', 'too', 'idea', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'real', 'comic', 'genius', 'great', 'bit', 'fun', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'was', 'Seen-it-all-before-and-done-better-in-other-films', 'groaner.But', 'hey', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'thought', 'Man', 'Screaming', 'Brain', 'and/or', 'Alien', 'Apocalypse', 'was', 'decades', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'movie.Meanwhile', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'waiting', 'someone', 'recognize', 'Bruce', 'potential', 'give', 'great', 'part', 'worthy', 'comic', 'genius', 'just', 'NOT', 'be', 'film', 'least', 'anyway']",N/A
1207653,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B001KEGR5M,Stuart Conover,"[1, 1]","There aren't a lot of horror comedies I can openly admit to really enjoying but very few can truly resist the charm of quite possibly the best B-actor to walk the face of the planet - Bruce Campbell. Honestly if you haven't seen the other major films Bruce has been in (The Evil Dead series) you may not yet be ready to watch this one. This film not only gives us Bruce in the starring role but also is directed by the man, the myth, the legend - Bruce Campbell. Yes he has learned the art of multitasking on this one and could only be better if it was written by none other than... Mark Verheiden. OK Bruce can do quite a bit but he doesn't do everything under the sun. Mark Verheiden has mainly written television shows until this point (aside from a small 90's comedy known as The Mask) but did such a great job Bruce signed him up for his next epic battle - Bruce Vs. Frankenstein. I for one after seeing My Name Is Bruce cannot wait for the next film they do together and with a title like that you know comedy gold will be in the works.At any rate in this film Bruce Campbell plays - himself. Yes a run down B-Actor who is doing film after film of horrible movies with nowhere to go in life and running out of friends and jobs. Meanwhile in a small hillbilly town an ancient evil, Guan-Di (the Chinese God of War, protector of the dead, and bean curd) has been awakened and is terrorizing the countryside. No one is quite sure what to do but one of the town's inhabitants, Jeff (Taylor Sharpe), is a huge fan (stalker) of Bruce and believes that he is the only man capable of saving the town from the curse that has befallen it. Anyone who has been able to live through so many B-Movies has to know how to handle a real life situation of the same magnitude, right?To get Bruce out there he kidnaps him and due to an entertaining set of circumstances (and Bruce being Bruce) he quickly believes that he is actually being hired to star in a new movie, not save a town from a monster that is real. We are introduced to the boy's mother where a love interest blooms between Bruce and Kelly Grahm (Grace Thorsen,) at least in Bruce's mind this is happening. When he realizes that the demon is actually real he responds in true Bruce fashion - he runs away as far and fast as he can.Bruce never fails to delivery on entertainment. He has B-Movie campiness down to an art form and can fuse this talent into any genre. Gladly he has chosen to mix it with horror as it is non-stop laughs in a very twisted and self loathing kind of way.

1207658,AU9ND05L99YSG,B001KEGR5M,TheHorrorMovieCritic,"[2, 2]","Last night I had the privilege of seeing My Name is Bruce. Mr. Campbell was actually at the theatre to help promote the film. As a longtime Bruce fanatic I was overcome with child-like giddiness when he came out to answer questions. The man is THE definition of cool. If you ever have the chance to meet him do yourself a favor and go, you will not be disappointed!My Name is Bruce revolves around the plot that an accidentally awakened Chinese Demon is about to murder all the residents of a tiny Oregon town. A young teenager has convinced the authorities that their only hope is legendary B-Movie Star Bruce Campbell. It's completely ridiculous and an absolute riot at the same time. The main gag is that Bruce isn't a super cool, outgoing and appreciative movie star; rather he is a womanizing, drunken, cowardly douche-bag.  Oh, and he has no clue that the Demon is real and not some elaborate ruse set up by his agent.Bruce plays ""himself"" way over the top and its pure joy to witness. It goes without saying that if you even remotely enjoy Campbell, you will love this film.  From the director's chair, Campbell melds the slapstick horror humor of Army of Darkness with the brutal beheadings of Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. My Name is Bruce is more funny than scary, but really the film is just a vehicle to allow fans to relish in the greatness of Campbell. Even though he runs the gamut of deplorable acts it's still easy to love him! Bruce eventually has a ""coming of age"" moment though it's still not that profound (and he remains a cantankerous scumbag pretty much till the bitter end). As an added treat you get not one, but three separate roles from the always dependable Ted Raimi. Sure goofy sound effects and hammed up acting normally make a movie unwatchable, but in this case it all adds to the campy charm. Experiencing this in a theatre packed with Campbell fanatics was merely icing on an already deliriously scrumptious cake.Preposterous, outlandish and absurd...these are all words that perfectly exemplify My Name is Bruce. Honestly, it's actually a compliment since that is exactly what the film-makers set out to create. Bruce Campbell's life and career IS absurd and ludicrous, so a movie about it would certainly need to dial it up to eleven. I could have used a little more gore, and perhaps a new Campbell catchphrase. Regardless, this coupled with Bubba Ho Tep proves that Bruce Campbell is still at the top of his game.

""My Name Is Bruce"" is not to be taken as a serious film in any way.  In fact, if you are capable of seeing Bruce Campbell's name on a film and then not seeing it, you will probably hate this movie.  This is nothing more than a satirical tribute to a well-loved B-movie star who never got his due from anybody but the dozens of raving lunatics the man calls fans.  It's an intoxicatingly amusing cocktail of narcissism and self-deprecating masochism filled with godawful Z-grade effects, borderline racist caricatures (okay, outright racist caricatures), cheesy genre cliches, incessant hammery, and so many blatant winking references that your eyes will start to hurt after the first 15 minutes.  But it's BRUCE!  BRRRUUUUCCCCE!!!!  What can I say?  Like William Shatner and Adam West, the man is made almost entirely out of awesome.As I said, not a second of this movie can be taken seriously.  It was obviously a tongue-in-cheek labor of love by the fans, for the fans even though it was Campbell himself who took the reins as director.  And naturally, he is the best (only) reason to see this film.  Whether he's lapping booze from a dog bowl while scoffing at his ex-wife's labeling him as pathetic, shoving a rude wheelchair-bound fan into traffic, considering the services of the transgender hooker his agent (played by Ted Raimi) got him for his birthday, or just generally acting like the biggest D-bag on the face of the earth, ""the greatest actor of his generation"" mugs at the camera and dares you not to laugh.  Toss in some Deliverance and Brokeback Mountain references (getting old, but still good for a chuckle), plenty of decapitations by a Chinese god of bean curds, and a clumsy ""romance"" with a spectacularly bouncy country girl and you've got an entertaining (almost) 90 minutes. Then there's the folk-music interludes singing the story of the villain, Guan-Di, who battles Campbell after the actor is kidnapped by a fan and tapped to defend a small town from the rampaging demon.  It's all so ridiculous one can't help but have a good time.  And you've got love the quickie Q&A; when Bruce meets some of his adoring fans.  Q: ""Did working with Ellen turn you gay?""  A: ""No, but your stupid question did.""  Just another day in the life of an entertainment genius.While I can appreciate the carelessness, Z-grade quality, and lack of political correctness MNIB so proudly displays, I have to point out a pet peeve of mine.  It's Asians or other minority characters being portrayed by white actors.  It just bugs me.  And when the character is a buffoonish stereotype, all the worse.  Not that I didn't snicker at Ted Raimi dressed as an old Chinese man accosting Bruce's ""engrish"", but I do feel that it was wholly unnecessary and more than a bit racist. It's just not a good look.  And this is coming from a guy with a massive tolerance for tongue-in-cheek racism.  But then again, in a movie so insistent that it not be taken seriously that it mocks it's own ending (if you can even call it that) then I can forgive.  Oh, Bruce; you know I can't stay mad at you.As a Bruce Campbell tribute/roast, MNIB is a must-see to the fans.  It's not a great film, but you should certainly give it some sugar, baby. There are several extras including an hour-long making-of feature with the genius title of ""Heart of Dorkness"".  There is also about 4 minutes of behind-the-scenes inanity from the man of the hour (and a half) featuring Bruce on cougar attacks, Bruce flipping off the camera, and other bits that will leave you wondering ""how hard up were they for bonus materials?"".  And let us not forget the added features for the fictional (I hope) ""Cave Aliens 2"" which is the film Bruce is shooting in the film.  I would have wished for a better tribute to a man who has brought me so much joy, but somehow an inept B-movie just seems like the only way to go.3 1/2 stars rounded up because it's Bruce fu@%ing Campbell.",4,WWBCD?,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,4157,"['feel', 'kind', 'funny', 'posting', 'positive', 'Amazon', 'review', 'film', 'site', 'name', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'movies', 'were', 'plants', ""'m"", 'asking', 'abuse', 'something', 'Name', 'Bruce', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'serious', 'film', 'way', 'fact', 'are', 'capable', 'seeing', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'name', 'film', 'then', 'not', 'seeing', 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'satirical', 'tribute', 'well-loved', 'B-movie', 'star', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'due', 'anybody', 'dozens', 'raving', 'lunatics', 'man', 'fans', 'intoxicatingly', 'amusing', 'cocktail', 'narcissism', 'self-deprecating', 'masochism', 'filled', 'godawful', 'Z-grade', 'effects', 'borderline', 'racist', 'caricatures', 'okay', 'outright', 'racist', 'caricatures', 'cheesy', 'genre', 'cliches', 'incessant', 'hammery', 'so', 'many', 'blatant', 'winking', 'references', 'eyes', 'will', 'start', 'hurt', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'BRUCE', 'BRRRUUUUCCCCE', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Adam', 'West', 'man', 'made', 'almost', 'entirely', 'awesome.As', 'said', 'not', 'second', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'was', 'obviously', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'labor', 'love', 'fans', 'fans', 'even', 'was', 'Campbell', 'who', 'took', 'reins', 'director', 'naturally', 'best', 'only', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'lapping', 'booze', 'dog', 'bowl', 'scoffing', 'ex-wife', 'labeling', 'pathetic', 'shoving', 'rude', 'wheelchair-bound', 'fan', 'traffic', 'considering', 'services', 'transgender', 'hooker', 'agent', 'played', 'Ted', 'Raimi', 'got', 'birthday', 'just', 'generally', 'acting', 'biggest', 'D-bag', 'face', 'earth', 'greatest', 'actor', 'generation', 'mugs', 'camera', 'dares', 'not', 'laugh', 'Toss', 'Deliverance', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'references', 'getting', 'old', 'still', 'good', 'chuckle', 'plenty', 'decapitations', 'Chinese', 'god', 'bean', 'curds', 'clumsy', 'romance', 'spectacularly', 'bouncy', 'country', 'girl', ""'ve"", 'got', 'entertaining', 'almost', '90', 'minutes', 'Then', 'folk-music', 'interludes', 'singing', 'story', 'villain', 'Guan-Di', 'who', 'Campbell', 'actor', 'kidnapped', 'fan', 'tapped', 'defend', 'small', 'town', 'rampaging', 'demon', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'have', 'good', 'time', ""'ve"", 'got', 'quickie', 'Q', 'A', 'when', 'Bruce', 'adoring', 'fans', 'Q', 'Did', 'working', 'Ellen', 'turn', 'gay', 'A', 'No', 'stupid', 'question', 'did', 'Just', 'day', 'life', 'entertainment', 'genius.While', 'can', 'appreciate', 'carelessness', 'Z-grade', 'quality', 'lack', 'political', 'correctness', 'MNIB', 'so', 'proudly', 'displays', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'Asians', 'other', 'minority', 'characters', 'being', 'portrayed', 'white', 'actors', 'just', 'bugs', 'when', 'character', 'buffoonish', 'stereotype', 'worse', 'Not', 'did', ""n't"", 'snicker', 'Ted', 'Raimi', 'dressed', 'old', 'Chinese', 'man', 'accosting', 'Bruce', 'engrish', 'do', 'feel', 'was', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'more', 'bit', 'racist', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'look', 'coming', 'guy', 'massive', 'tolerance', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'racism', 'then', 'again', 'movie', 'so', 'insistent', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'own', 'ending', 'can', 'even', 'call', 'then', 'can', 'forgive', 'Oh', 'Bruce', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'mad', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'tribute/roast', 'MNIB', 'must-see', 'fans', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'should', 'certainly', 'give', 'sugar', 'baby', 'are', 'several', 'extras', 'including', 'hour-long', 'making-of', 'feature', 'genius', 'title', 'Heart', 'Dorkness', 'also', 'about', '4', 'minutes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'inanity', 'man', 'hour', 'half', 'featuring', 'Bruce', 'cougar', 'attacks', 'Bruce', 'flipping', 'off', 'camera', 'other', 'bits', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'how', 'hard', 'up', 'were', 'bonus', 'materials', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'added', 'features', 'fictional', 'hope', 'Cave', '2', 'film', 'Bruce', 'shooting', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'wished', 'better', 'tribute', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'joy', 'somehow', 'inept', 'B-movie', 'just', 'only', 'way', 'go.3', '1/2', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', 'Bruce', 'fu', '@', '%', 'ing', 'Campbell']",N/A

This movie is NOT on par with AoD but it gets 4 stars for 3 reasons:1. Bruce Campbell - The worst movie in the world would get bumped up a star just because Bruce Campbell is in it.  There is just something about Bruce that makes a stupid line in a stupid movie fun to watch.2. Grace Thorsen - Who the heck is she?  That is what I said, especially when she took off her apron for the dance scene.  She bumped the movie up TWO stars.3. The special features, all of them, are fun and funny!  I'd go so far as to say the the special features are maybe even better than the movie... and they are just about as long as the movie.  This bumps the movie up another star.So, you do the math.  4 stars rating and all 4 stars are accounted for in the previous 3 items.  I guess that means the actual movie comes in at zero stars, but who cares.  It was fun.  I have suspicions that Bruce Campbell made this movie just to put a paycheck into the pockets of the 36 or so friends of his who were involved in making it and to have fun in his back yard during his time off from Burn Notice.  The movie kind of sucks but you can tell they had fun making it and it is fun to watch.
