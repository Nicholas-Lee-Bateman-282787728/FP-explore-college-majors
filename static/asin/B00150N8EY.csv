Perhaps this one is even better, minus the music of course. I had no clue what I was getting into with this flick, but it didn't take me long to figure out that this was a Christian film that I could honestly say I truly enjoyed. My goal is to review all of the Christian movies I can find. As I watch them, I always have a critical eye upon them which usually spies out unrealistic or contrived situations/plots, cardboard characters, poor acting, etc, forcing me to deduct style points and feel bad that I can't extol the virtues of the film and recommend it highly to everyone. It feels so good to run across a film with a good Christian message that delighted me all the way around.  I can't believe that this story only got three doves from the Dove Foundation. I'd have given it six out of five. This is one of few Christian films that I'd actually look forward to watching again.

Money and happiness can come and go.  It is a great message to kids who feel so much worldly pressure to be rich and successful. At what cost is that kind of path going to lead us. It is clear; it is not the best path to choose.  Anyone who has lost a loved one or an important relationship will relate to this story. Where is God? How could Jesus do this to me? But God always seems to send us at least one person who won't give up and will show us what love and faith are, again. There is always someone out there who loves us for who we are, good or bad, and that person is like an anchor in the storm.  With those lessons aside, this film will tug at your heart strings, in a good way. You will definitely find the beast, the beauty and a very good villain in this film.  I did not have any preconceived ideas before watching.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find a good story, good twists and very good acting.
