45478,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,0783213638,Dorrie Wheeler,"[45, 48]","As you may know, comedian Richard Pryor passed away in December of 2005 following a massive heart attack. The award winning funnyman had also been suffering from Multiple Sclerosis. On February 7th, Universal released a four movie collection titled The Richard Pryor 4-Movie Collection. Universal re-released Bustin' Loose on DVD last year as part of their Soul Cinema collection, so I was a bit curious as to why this film was being released on DVD again.The Richard Pryor 4 Movie Collection features the following films-Which Way Is Up, Brewster's Millions, Car Wash, and Bustin' Loose. This is a good collection of Pryor's funnier films. The bad thing about this collection is the bare bones treatment. There is no booklet, there are no new bonus features (as a matter of fact there are no bonus features at all), and there aren't even four discs. The movies are packaged on dual sided discs with two movies on each side of one disc. Each film is presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1).As for the movies, you may have seen them before on DVD. Which Way Is Up? was released on DVD in the past but has been out of print for awhile. This was one of Pryor's funniest vehicles. In this film he plays three different characters. Many critics have said that Eddie Murphy was inspired by this film because in later films Coming To America, and The Nutty Professor he juggled multiple roles. In this film Pryor stars as three different characters. Pryor stars as Leroy the orange picker, Leroy's father, and he stars as the minister who sexed up Leroy's wife while he was away working. Leroy himself also falls in love with another woman and finds himself juggling relationships.Car Wash is a classic film with a host of guest stars. Pryor wasn't the star of Car Wash despite his name usually getting top billing in cover art. It's an ensemble film about people working at a popular car wash. Antonio Fargas (Starsky & Hutch), Bill Duke (Menace 2 Society) and George Carlin (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure) co-star in the film.Bustin' Loose ushered in a new era of Richard Pryor films. This ushered in the family friendly Richard Pryor (although there is still strong language in the film). Richard Pryor stars in this film as a man on parole with the threat of going back to jail held over his head. He doesn't have much time but he has to transport Cicely Tyson and a group of rag tag youths across the country.Brewster's Millions is a very popular Pryor film although it's considered a dud by many. In this film Pryor has inherited a lot of money, but to get the money has to spend $30 million dollars in thirty days. There is a catch. He can't purchase anything large like a house. It's a fun film and John Candy co-stars.The set just comes across as cheap when you look at other movie collections that Universal has released in the past year. The Alfred Hitchcock Collection, and special editions of To Kill a Mockingbird, The Sting and The Deer Hunter seem so precious, unique, and effort filled. This set just seems thrown together. If you already own these films on DVD, keep your single disc sets. This collection is so bare bones it deserves to be in the bargain basket. What else is tragic about this movie collection is once again no bonus features. This is at least the third incarnation of Car Wash on DVD. So many of the people involved in the film are still alive and working in the industry. It would be great to get some kind of commentary or bonus featurette for this film one day. Also, since Richard has passed, it would have been nice if they held up this set's release to include some kind of tribute to Richard.The bottom line is if you already own these films keep your single discs. If you don't own these films, this is a reasonable way to purchase all of the films.",3,"Good Movies, Bare Bones Treatment",1139443200,"02 9, 2006",2006,3794,"['may', 'know', 'comedian', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'passed', 'away', 'December', '2005', 'following', 'massive', 'heart', 'attack', 'award', 'winning', 'funnyman', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'suffering', 'Multiple', 'Sclerosis', 'February', '7th', 'Universal', 'released', 'four', 'movie', 'collection', 'titled', 'Richard', 'Pryor', '4-Movie', 'Collection', 'Universal', 're-released', 'Bustin', 'Loose', 'DVD', 'last', 'year', 'part', 'Soul', 'Cinema', 'collection', 'was', 'bit', 'curious', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'again.The', 'Richard', 'Pryor', '4', 'Movie', 'Collection', 'following', 'films-Which', 'Way', 'Up', 'Brewster', 'Millions', 'Car', 'Wash', 'Bustin', 'Loose', 'good', 'collection', 'Pryor', 'funnier', 'films', 'bad', 'thing', 'collection', 'bare', 'bones', 'treatment', 'booklet', 'are', 'new', 'bonus', 'features', 'matter', 'fact', 'are', 'bonus', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'four', 'discs', 'movies', 'are', 'packaged', 'dual', 'sided', 'discs', 'two', 'movies', 'side', 'one', 'disc', 'film', 'presented', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', '1.85:1', '.As', 'movies', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'DVD', 'Which', 'Way', 'Up', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'past', 'been', 'print', 'awhile', 'was', 'one', 'Pryor', 'funniest', 'vehicles', 'film', 'three', 'different', 'characters', 'Many', 'critics', 'have', 'said', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'was', 'inspired', 'film', 'later', 'films', 'Coming', 'America', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'juggled', 'multiple', 'roles', 'film', 'Pryor', 'stars', 'three', 'different', 'characters', 'Pryor', 'Leroy', 'orange', 'picker', 'Leroy', 'father', 'minister', 'who', 'sexed', 'up', 'Leroy', 'wife', 'was', 'away', 'working', 'Leroy', 'also', 'love', 'woman', 'juggling', 'relationships.Car', 'Wash', 'classic', 'film', 'host', 'guest', 'stars', 'Pryor', 'was', ""n't"", 'star', 'Car', 'Wash', 'name', 'usually', 'getting', 'top', 'billing', 'cover', 'art', 'ensemble', 'film', 'people', 'working', 'popular', 'car', 'wash.', 'Antonio', 'Fargas', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'Menace', '2', 'Society', 'George', 'Carlin', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Excellent', 'Adventure', 'co-star', 'film.Bustin', 'Loose', 'ushered', 'new', 'era', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'films', 'ushered', 'family', 'friendly', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'still', 'strong', 'language', 'film', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'film', 'man', 'parole', 'threat', 'going', 'back', 'jail', 'held', 'head', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'transport', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'group', 'rag', 'tag', 'youths', 'country.Brewster', 'Millions', 'very', 'popular', 'Pryor', 'film', 'considered', 'dud', 'many', 'film', 'Pryor', 'inherited', 'lot', 'money', 'get', 'money', 'spend', '30', 'million', 'dollars', 'thirty', 'days', 'catch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'anything', 'large', 'house', 'fun', 'film', 'John', 'Candy', 'co-stars.The', 'set', 'just', 'across', 'cheap', 'when', 'look', 'other', 'movie', 'collections', 'Universal', 'released', 'past', 'year', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Collection', 'special', 'editions', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Sting', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'seem', 'so', 'precious', 'unique', 'effort', 'filled', 'set', 'just', 'thrown', 'together', 'already', 'own', 'films', 'DVD', 'keep', 'single', 'disc', 'sets', 'collection', 'so', 'bare', 'bones', 'be', 'bargain', 'basket', 'What', 'else', 'tragic', 'movie', 'collection', 'once', 'again', 'bonus', 'least', 'third', 'incarnation', 'Car', 'Wash', 'DVD', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'involved', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'working', 'industry', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'get', 'kind', 'commentary', 'bonus', 'featurette', 'film', 'one', 'day', 'Also', 'Richard', 'passed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'held', 'up', 'set', 'release', 'include', 'kind', 'tribute', 'Richard.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'already', 'own', 'films', 'keep', 'single', 'discs', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'films', 'reasonable', 'way', 'purchase', 'films']",N/A

These three characters interact with predictably insane results.It is not the scatological and regularly profane Pryor that many people came to know, or the tragic cocaine-addicted Pryor of the late '70's.  Also, he is not as cutting in political and social commentary he is later in his career (particularly in his standup).  But this is vintage Pryor.

Stelly ""Global Genius""","[5, 5]","He's an liar, and old man, a womanizer, a preacher, a husband, a lover and he's at the top of his game in every single one of them. RIchard Pryor was never the same after making ""Which Way Is Up?"" No doubt, producers saw this talent and decided to match him up with has-beens like Gene Wilder (Stir Crazy, Silver STreak, Hear no Evil See NO Evil)and gave him a lot of money to reduce his comic genius to slapstick and buffoonery instead of one lighters and facial expressions that have you rolling into the aisles. For instance, in one scene his character has boasted, to his wife (played beautifully by the sexy Marge Avery), that he has a mistress (his wife accused him of being a homosexual because he had not touched her in months). When this normally demure woman hears that, she snaps and uses every kitchen appliance to chase Pryor around the table. As she picks up a knife, the old man (also played by Pryor) is preparing to enter the kitchen just as she throws it. The knife sticks in the door, mere inches from the old man's head, and he shouts, ""The bitch done gon' berserk!"" This is, by far, one of the funniest parts of the movie.Richard Pryor is a standout in this movie and not to be missed should be the moral of the story: never sell out or you'll lose everything. Beautiful and black Lonette McKee is outstanding as Pryor's ""lady on the side,"" and the settings are incredibly realistic, from a field of fruitpickers to the understated home, to the manufacturing plant itself. The film is a work of art and a classic.

This movie is often neglected. Most bios of Richard Pryor emphasize his concert films, many of which are good and hilarious. Some bios point out to his other movies like Car Wash; but his role in this particular film was far too brief, and was really a cameo appearance. Others cite movies like Stir Crazy or The Toy. However, in these movies his comic genius was either trivialized or squandered.In this movie he was able to display the fullest array of his talent in one place. Pryor plays three roles in this movie. In the first role he plays the protagonist who is driven away from his home by corporation thugs, makes his life in the big city and returns home with his new spouse and the now changed family that he left behind. The plot and the protagonist is loosely based on the Lina Wertmuller film, The Seduction of Mimi. In the second role, he plays his father, which in reality is a concert character which is based on his own invention, Mudbone. In the third role he plays the Minister Lennox Thomas (an amalgam of Pryor's birth name), another familiar Pryor invention.The movie does have some drawbacks, primarily of which is the music, which is a faux-disco Hollywood standard soundtrack. At times, the movie seems a bit dated. What is not dated is the humor. The movie is hilarious and a showcase of the many sides of Richard Pryor.

45505,A3P7R0L2TTL7QB,0783213638,tkay,"[1, 1]","I just so happened to be surfing channels and happened upon the edited TV version of this movie on Centric. I never watch this movie when it comes on regular TV because the voice-overs are awful, almost laughable, but for some reason last night, I just HAD to watch (Richard does that to me). And much to my surprise, there were several scenes deleted and chopped or just flat out different. The background music is even different in some scenes. The editors of the DVD version should be ashamed of themselves. The DVD version is still hilarious, but could be so much better.I remember watching this movie as a child and during the bedroom scene when Leroy comes back home, he went to turn off the light, lifted it up and saw Vanetta in the bed. However, when I purchased the DVD as an adult, I noticed that the scene was gone. But I knew I wasn't crazy (wink-wink) and last night my sanity was confirmed when I saw the scene on the TV version. There were other scenes not on the DVD.1. THE DINNER TABLE - The scene is much longer. After Pop warns them about that piece of chicken and also warns Leroy about his inability to conceive, Leroy asks him not to talk that way in front of his wife and the children. Pop goes on to tell a little story about something that happened to him in 1929. Leroy goes on to tell Pop that this is NOT 1929. NOT ON THE DVD.The very next scene, Annie Mae tells Leroy she's proud of him and ""has the fever"", meaning she was ready to make love. They kissed, Leroy picked her up, spun her around, placed her on the bed and kissed her all over her body. She asked him to kiss the back of her knee, he got so disgusted with her demands and said ""Kiss this, kiss that, kiss my a--"", then stormed out of the room. NOT ON THE DVD.2. THE LETTER - This scene is also longer and different. Leroy writes that he goes straight to bed, after cooking dinner on a hot plate, but there's a woman waiting for him, on his bed. The scene where he gets a job is also longer.3. MEETING VANETTA - I was so angry when I saw these scenes, so much was left out. On his lunch break, Leroy runs to meet her and asks her for a date, she replies, ""November 8th, you can vote!"" The day at the park when he's trying to jog with her, after he collapses, she comes over to him to check on him. He gives her an excuse about catching cramps. When they spend the day together, Leroy acts like a bee and goes from flower to flower, on the DVD, they are playing with a water fountain, two different versions. Also, she invites him to her apartment, they walk through a store and he asks, ""You live in a store?"" She replies, ""No, my apartment is in the back."" They go in and he tells her about falling off the ladder and how his being a hero was an accident. NOT ON THE DVD.The dialogue between Leroy and Vanetta, while they're in bed (and she warns him about making love to any other woman), is longer and sweeter. They shared more kisses and the love between them is evident. Another funny bit: Vanetta put the candles out with her thoughts. ""Told you I was psychic."" NOT ON THE DVD.4. THE MOVE BACK HOME - As I mentioned before, the bedroom scene (between Leroy and Annie Mae)is totally different. As she is kissing on him, she turns off the lamp that is closest to them and tells him to turn off the other light across the room. When he goes to turn that light off, he lifts up the lamp shade and sees Vanetta in the bed, then gives Annie Mae an excuse about hurting his back. NOT ON THE DVD.Right before that scene, Leroy is in bed with Vanetta at their apartment. She tells him that it's after 11, he jumps out of bed, gets dressed in a hurry and tells her he loves her. She says,""Think about me."" He tells her he loves her again as he is leaving. NOT ON THE DVD.5. ANNIE MAE'S PREGNANCY - After Leroy announces he's going to ""kill the b--ch"", his friends all get in the car and ride with him to the house. NOT ON THE DVD.6. THE CHURCH SCENES - Again, longer. During the 1st church scene, The Reverend's sermon about revenge is longer and the conversation between Leroy and Chui is longer (outside the window). The ""Healing Glove"" scene is longer also. The Reverend tells his congregation that the more money they give, the sooner their healing will occur. HILARIOUS. NOT ON THE DVD.7. THE REVEREND'S DEMISE - Again, longer. After The Rev. gets run over by the tour bus, there is a close up of his wife, his children and Leroy. Leroy's smile quickly shifts to worry and concern, after he realizes the Rev. is dead. NOT ON THE DVD.The following bits were not on the edited TV version:- The couple fighting in Leroy's hotel room, ""You're in the wrong room.""- The sex scene between Leroy and Annie Mae when she handcuffs him to the bed.(I suppose it was deleted for editing reasons, to include the other scenes,and it may have been too sexual for regular TV.)- Sis. Sarah's pregnancy wasn't mentioned in the TV version.I hope that this DVD will be re-released in its entirety. While it is still hilarious and in my opinion, the best movie Richard Pryor ever made, it would be so much better with the deleted scenes.

45506,A26LIR24MAM6VQ,0783213638,"todd rich ""scoop 69""","[11, 12]",""" Which Way Is Up "" , has been , and still is one of the funniest movies , that I've seen. From the beginning to the end , it's just down right hilarious. I'm smiling right now , just thinking about certain scenes. The script isn't original , by any means...but Richard Pryor's comedic talents take this film to unprecedented heights of humor. During a period of 1970's film making , when stereotypical images of Blacks , were the norm , this film is highly likely to offend people who are desiring political correctness.However , if you're able to except this film , for what it is .....you'll soon find yourself laughing at every ludricrous scene. I think the genuine qualities, of this film , are that it doesn't try to be something it isn't. It also doesn't attmept to be over-the-top, ridiculous. It simply tells the story of Leroy Jones's ( a young man , who leads a life of stagnant impoverishment), relocation to the big city. Motivated by the prospects of new romance , more money , and the threat of being killed for unknowingly starting a worker's strike ( in his hometown)...Leroy moves.Early and dedicated perfomances by Leonette Mckee ( Sparkle , Jungle Fever , Malcom X , ect ) , Marilyn Coleman ( Menace 2 Society , Looking for Mr. Goodbar, ect. ), and Margaret Avery ( Color Purple ), give this film an inescapable sence of truth. Honestly , if it weren't for the cast's ability to play their characters with an honest sense of seriousness , this film wouldn't be so funny. But that's the key to "" Which Way Is Up"". And that's why it's still hilarious, today. I highly recommend it and it will remain one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen.The dvd doesn't offer anything , but the ability to skip and choose scenes . However , this film, captures Richard Pryor ( playing three different charactors ) during his comedic prime , and that's well worth the money you'll spend.",4,Hilarious Genius,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,1897,"['Which', 'Way', 'been', 'still', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'beginning', 'end', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'hilarious', ""'m"", 'smiling', 'right', 'now', 'just', 'thinking', 'about', 'certain', 'scenes', 'script', ""n't"", 'original', 'means', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'comedic', 'talents', 'take', 'film', 'unprecedented', 'heights', 'humor', 'period', '1970', 'film', 'making', 'when', 'stereotypical', 'images', 'Blacks', 'were', 'norm', 'film', 'highly', 'likely', 'offend', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'desiring', 'political', 'correctness.However', ""'re"", 'able', 'except', 'film', 'what', '..you', ""'ll"", 'soon', 'find', 'laughing', 'ludricrous', 'scene', 'think', 'genuine', 'qualities', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'something', ""n't"", 'also', ""n't"", 'attmept', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'ridiculous', 'simply', 'story', 'Leroy', 'Jones', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'stagnant', 'impoverishment', 'relocation', 'big', 'city', 'Motivated', 'prospects', 'new', 'romance', 'more', 'money', 'threat', 'being', 'killed', 'unknowingly', 'starting', 'worker', 'strike', 'hometown', 'Leroy', 'moves.Early', 'dedicated', 'perfomances', 'Leonette', 'Mckee', 'Sparkle', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'Malcom', 'X', 'ect', 'Marilyn', 'Coleman', 'Menace', '2', 'Society', 'Looking', 'Mr.', 'Goodbar', 'ect', 'Margaret', 'Avery', 'Color', 'Purple', 'give', 'film', 'inescapable', 'sence', 'truth', 'Honestly', 'were', ""n't"", 'cast', 'ability', 'play', 'characters', 'honest', 'sense', 'seriousness', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'funny', 'key', 'Which', 'Way', 'Up', 'why', 'still', 'hilarious', 'today', 'highly', 'recommend', 'will', 'remain', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.The', 'dvd', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'ability', 'skip', 'choose', 'scenes', 'However', 'film', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'playing', 'three', 'different', 'charactors', 'comedic', 'prime', 'well', 'money', ""'ll"", 'spend']",N/A
