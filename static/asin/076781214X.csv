Who would have thought that Coppola could produce something as good as this and do it successfully. Peggy Sue is going to her high school reunion. She hits her head and revisits her high school days. Peggy Sue has a choice, travel the once traveled path (get pregnant young and end in a broken marriage) or take the alternate route. Will she follow her heart or her head? Will she rediscover love? This is a great film. Kathleen Turner is great in it as the too- mature- for- her- age- because- she- has- already- lived- it-teenager and Nicholas Cage is great at playing the brainless, funny and just about confused teenager and adult. This is one of the only Nicholas Cage movies I like. The film is succeeds because it has great character development and a very well carried out storyline.

It's just a one big time travel just to experience the nostalgia. Is that really the case or did Francis Ford Coppola catch the American Graffiti and Diner fever? In either case, Peggy Sue Got Married doesn't work for me, and I pretty much miss the point (or maybe there isn't a one) of it. It is as if Peggy Sue really never grew up, and she learns nothing during her nostalgic trip. Her intelligence, before and after, remains profoundly average. Even worse is the acting. It's too corny and outdated. Jim Carrey makes it all worse, portraying the drug addict one too many times. Jim, time to get off coke for real, please. Now, Nicolas Cage is one of the most talented actors to emerge out of the 80s, but his performance in the film is over-the-top in a bad way. Meanwhile, Kathleen Turner doesn't seem to be into her role although her intentions are well-meaning. I just feel like her character isn't likeable because she is trying to change the fact that she got married to Charlie yet that would mean her two children would never have been born. She becomes selfish because she fails to think of them. The whole poet thing is ridiculous to watch because it's quite apparent that Michael Fitzsimmons is a one giant flake. If he is super mysterious in a cool way, kind of like a James Dean, it might work, but the selection of the actor literally kills the film. There are moments in the film that are never explained throughout the film. One glaring example is the old high school friend who ends up being in a wheelchair. So...how? Another is the red M&Ms.; Although not explained in the movie, it turns out that they cause cancer. Like...we all knew that. Also, the line ""Why, I oughta..."" is somewhat inferred from The Three Stooges, but its reference throughout the film was getting stale and lost in its meaning. How Peggy Sue acts around certain people, making the audience think that they later died, becomes a big disappointment because we will never know for sure since nothing is revealed about the fates of everybody. All in all, yes...Peggy Sue Got Married is a charming film to watch, and I like it, but there is a lack of many explanations, leaving the film sorely incomplete.",3,Incomplete Nostalgic Trip Which was Devoid of a Point.,1309478400,"07 1, 2011",2011,2325,"['Viewed', '6/11Rate', '56/11', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'time', 'see', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Got', 'Married', 'feel', 'nothing', 'really', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'time', 'travel', 'just', 'experience', 'nostalgia', 'really', 'case', 'did', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'catch', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'Diner', 'fever', 'case', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Got', 'Married', ""n't"", 'work', 'pretty', 'much', 'miss', 'point', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'one', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'really', 'never', 'grew', 'up', 'nothing', 'nostalgic', 'trip', 'intelligence', 'profoundly', 'average', 'Even', 'worse', 'acting', 'too', 'corny', 'outdated', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'worse', 'portraying', 'drug', 'addict', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Jim', 'time', 'get', 'off', 'coke', 'real', 'please', 'Now', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'emerge', '80s', 'performance', 'film', 'over-the-top', 'bad', 'way', 'Meanwhile', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'role', 'intentions', 'are', 'well-meaning', 'just', 'feel', 'character', ""n't"", 'likeable', 'trying', 'change', 'fact', 'got', 'married', 'Charlie', 'yet', 'would', 'mean', 'two', 'children', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'selfish', 'think', 'whole', 'poet', 'thing', 'ridiculous', 'watch', 'quite', 'apparent', 'Michael', 'Fitzsimmons', 'one', 'giant', 'flake', 'super', 'mysterious', 'cool', 'way', 'kind', 'James', 'Dean', 'might', 'work', 'selection', 'actor', 'literally', 'film', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'film', 'One', 'glaring', 'example', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'wheelchair', 'So', 'how', 'red', 'M', 'Ms', 'not', 'explained', 'movie', 'out', 'cause', 'cancer', 'knew', 'Also', 'line', 'Why', 'oughta', 'somewhat', 'inferred', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'reference', 'film', 'was', 'getting', 'stale', 'lost', 'meaning', 'How', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'around', 'certain', 'people', 'making', 'audience', 'think', 'later', 'died', 'big', 'disappointment', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'sure', 'nothing', 'revealed', 'fates', 'everybody', 'yes', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Got', 'Married', 'charming', 'film', 'watch', 'like', 'lack', 'many', 'explanations', 'leaving', 'film', 'sorely', 'incomplete']",N/A

I barely recognised Kathleen Turner, she's changed a lot in 20 years - but then again, I only really know her as Jessica Rabbit's voice, and Chandler's dad in Friends. (A woman playing a man dressed as a woman!)There's a few hilarious characters in this, listen to Nicolas Cage's voice - what a horrible voice it is, but apparently he based it on something else. But it's still horrible to listen to. (The hair's dodgy too!) Helen Hunt appears in a tiny role, playing Peggy Sue's daughter, although she's only 9 years younger than Kathleen Turner! Also look out for an incredibly young Jim Carrey, stealing every scene with his face pulling!The story is all about a girl called Peggy Sue, is going through a divorce from her childhood sweetheart, and nervous about going to her high school reunion. When she gets to her high school reunion, with her daughter as her 'date' she gets made the Queen, and faints. When she comes to, she's gone back in time by twenty five years. Back to her high school sweetheart, with even dodgier hair (!), and all her old friends. The film gets pretty basic from here on in, it's quite predictable what happens to her.Apart from that, it's a little gem of a film. More could have been done with it, but it's an hour and a half, and it's the perfect way to spend an afternoon. It's enjoyable, no thinking is required, and Jim Carrey is hilarious!!!

Making it even worse, she and her husband, high school sweetheart Charlie Bodell (Nicolas Cage) are in the middle of a divorce because Peggy Sue has finally gotten tired of his affairs.  And so she shows up with her daughter Beth (Helen Hunt).Things are actually going well until Charlie shows up.  Then Peggy Sue wins homecoming queen.  It's all too much for her, and she faints.When she comes too, Peggy Sue finds herself back in 1960.  She's eighteen again and reliving the last few months of high school.  Between panic attacks about what this could mean, she tries to grasp her second chance at her life.  Can she avoid the last 25 years of pain?  Does she really want to?The movie walks a fine line between comedy and drama and never quite seems to strike the right balance.  There are some very funny bits, but those just make the drama seem more over the top and over wrought.  And the comedy is stuff we've seen done elsewhere better many other times.The cast features a number of early performances from actors better known today.  Besides the ones already mentioned, we see Jim Carrey and Joan Allen, for example.  Most of the cast is fine.  My biggest problem was with Nicolas Cage. For some reason, he gives Charlie a weird nasally voice.  Frankly, it makes me wonder what Peggy Sue ever saw in him.  On the plus side, he gets to show off his excellent singing voice.Finally, there's the story.  It works.  But it is left too open ended.  That's probably caused by an ending that is way too abrupt to deal with everything brought up.  It asks all kinds of questions, but the answers are thrown at us so fast it doesn't really explain how the characters arrived at them.

11137,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,076781214X,,"[3, 5]","Nothing more than lightweight Coppola; at times `Peggy Sue Got Married' can be a little too light.  It doesn't mean that this is a total waste of time (the lead performance by Kathleen Turner is a gem and deserved that Oscar nomination it was handed) but to say that this is a great comedy is stretching it a bit thin.  Maybe that's the real problem.The film itself is a bit thin.The film opens with Peggy Sue Bodell going to her 25 year High School reunion fresh off her split from high school sweetheart Charlie Bodell.  He cheated and treated her badly and so, with a divorce in the wings, she attends her reunion with her daughter hoping to have a good time and forget about him for the evening, but everything reminds her of her past and soon she is overwhelmed with anxiety.Then she faints and wakes up a teenager again, back in high school with the chance to do it all over.The main issue I have is with the script, which doesn't really seem to have a point.  Sure, it is supposed to give Peggy a chance to decide if she really wants to live the life she picked for herself, but really; her end decision makes the whole film null and void in my opinion.  There just seems to be no real progression of character.  Peggy keeps telling others that she is an adult with life experiences and thus she can make a more informed decision now about how she should have lived her life; but she never makes that informed decision.  Regardless though, Kathleen Turner sells it gloriously.  We believe her, even if the script does not.  She is hilarious and honest throughout, capturing the innocence of childhood with the towering knowledge of adulthood.  You can feel the weight of the truth on her shoulders yet she manages to mask it with the carelessness of someone experiencing life for the first time.If it wasn't for Turner I would have turned this off.Nicolas Cage is not an actor I like.  I think he was amazing in three films (count em'...1, 2, 3) and I think he has single-handedly destroyed every other movie he's walked onto.  This is not really an exception.  He actually gives a decent performance, but his performance is so overly annoying that he makes it hard to pay attention.  I think my wife described him as `disgusting' here and I somewhat have to agree.Look out for a slew of familiar faces, all before they became really familiar.  Aside from Turner and Cage there is screen goddess Joan Allen in a small role as Peggy's friend Maddy, as well as Jim Carry who plays Charlie's friend Walter and even Sophia Coppola (amazing director, horrible actress) plays Peggy's kid sister.In the end I say, watch the movie for Turner.  It's lightweight fare that can be entertaining, and some of the dialog is witty and fresh, but don't expect anything remotely profound (which is sad because it had the promise to be really smart).",3,Turner is practically the only reason to watch this middlebrow film...,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,2839,"['Nothing', 'more', 'lightweight', 'Coppola', 'times', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Got', 'Married', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'light', ""n't"", 'mean', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'lead', 'performance', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'gem', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'handed', 'say', 'great', 'comedy', 'stretching', 'bit', 'thin', 'Maybe', 'real', 'problem.The', 'film', 'bit', 'thin.The', 'film', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Bodell', 'going', '25', 'year', 'High', 'School', 'reunion', 'fresh', 'off', 'split', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Charlie', 'Bodell', 'cheated', 'treated', 'badly', 'so', 'divorce', 'wings', 'reunion', 'daughter', 'hoping', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'forget', 'evening', 'everything', 'past', 'soon', 'overwhelmed', 'anxiety.Then', 'faints', 'up', 'teenager', 'again', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'chance', 'do', 'over.The', 'main', 'issue', 'have', 'script', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'have', 'point', 'Sure', 'supposed', 'give', 'Peggy', 'chance', 'decide', 'really', 'live', 'life', 'picked', 'herself', 'really', 'end', 'decision', 'whole', 'film', 'null', 'void', 'opinion', 'just', 'be', 'real', 'progression', 'character', 'Peggy', 'keeps', 'telling', 'others', 'adult', 'life', 'experiences', 'thus', 'can', 'make', 'more', 'informed', 'decision', 'now', 'how', 'should', 'have', 'lived', 'life', 'never', 'informed', 'decision', 'Regardless', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'gloriously', 'believe', 'even', 'script', 'not', 'hilarious', 'honest', 'capturing', 'innocence', 'childhood', 'towering', 'knowledge', 'adulthood', 'can', 'feel', 'weight', 'truth', 'shoulders', 'yet', 'mask', 'carelessness', 'someone', 'experiencing', 'life', 'first', 'time.If', 'was', ""n't"", 'Turner', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'off.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'not', 'actor', 'like', 'think', 'was', 'amazing', 'three', 'films', 'count', 'em', '1', '2', '3', 'think', 'single-handedly', 'destroyed', 'other', 'movie', 'walked', 'not', 'really', 'exception', 'actually', 'decent', 'performance', 'performance', 'so', 'overly', 'annoying', 'hard', 'pay', 'attention', 'think', 'wife', 'described', 'disgusting', 'here', 'somewhat', 'have', 'agree.Look', 'out', 'slew', 'familiar', 'became', 'really', 'familiar', 'Aside', 'Turner', 'Cage', 'screen', 'goddess', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'small', 'role', 'Peggy', 'friend', 'Maddy', 'as', 'well', 'Jim', 'Carry', 'who', 'Charlie', 'friend', 'Walter', 'even', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'amazing', 'director', 'horrible', 'actress', 'Peggy', 'kid', 'end', 'say', 'watch', 'movie', 'Turner', 'lightweight', 'fare', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'dialog', 'witty', 'fresh', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'remotely', 'sad', 'had', 'promise', 'be', 'really', 'smart']",N/A

Firstly that Francis Ford Coppola would choose something like a pseudo romantic comedy to add to his resume.  Secondly that Nicholas Cage would star as the male lead, when he was known before as being the dingbat bumbling fool and after as the brooding dark eccentric.  And third, the whole premise of the movie was just plain odd.Kathleen Turner plays Peggy Sue, a divorced, middle aged and unhappy woman who goes to her high school reunion despite all her misgivings.  At the reunion she faints, then wakes up back in time.  She is once again in high school.  She is given a chance to do it all over again.The foundation of this movie was not odd, as it's been the theme of many sci fi and fantasy films past and present.  There are a few funny moments with the typical fish out of water / anachronism humor (I also remembered going to my high school reunion and remarking that a lot of things they taught were so useless - You didn't take Honors English last year so you have to stay in the Special Ed English class! - You can't have study hall! Gym class is priority! - Take the science elective or you won't get into college!, etc.).  She starts off the movie saying that had she known then what she knows now, she would have done things much differently.  We all think that at one point or another.  And she does do some things differently, like going for the mysterious poet she always admired from afar.  But, she doesn't do things differently in the end.  She is approached by the school nerd who would grow up to be a wealthy and successful man, and when he proposes that she change her destiny and marry him, she refuses.  Peggy Sue said she wanted to go back to the present because she missed her kids.  Missed her kids?!  If she stayed in this time or went with someone else her kids wouldn't exist!  She ends up with her husband, perhaps because of this reason, and essentially continues back down the same path.That was a disappointment, a major disappointment.  She goes back in time and doesn't affect the future in a positive way, except to afirm to herself that she is content being miserable in the present.  And how about that weird scene with her grandparents and trying to send her back in time at the Shriners' convention?  Too stupid for words.

There, she&#8217;s able to revisit the past through her adult perspective, realizing that the relationship she has with her high school boyfriend &#8211; and future husband &#8211; Nicolas Cage isn&#8217;t as black or white as she may have remembered.&#8220;Peggy Sue Got Married&#8221; is a very likeable but flawed film with a big, gaping hole at its center in Cage&#8217;s misguided performance. Critics took him to task for his portrayal of Peggy Sue&#8217;s philandering husband and with good reason, as the film nearly sinks under the weight of his overly eccentric character interpretation. Everyone from Kathleen Turner to &#8211; ultimately &#8211; Cage himself derided his performance here, but what&#8217;s worth asking is how much of the blame lies not with the actor but Coppola. Given that Coppola was directing his then-young nephew here, shouldn&#8217;t he have at least given Cage some guidance and said, &#8220;here, tone it down&#8221;?Still, the wistful atmosphere of the picture, punctuated by so many familiar faces (Jim Carrey, Helen Hunt, Catherine Hicks, Kevin J. O&#8217;Connor, even Joan Allen&#8230;who looks middle aged even when she&#8217;s in her high school scenes!), is impossible to deny. So is the cinematography of Jordan Cronenweth and especially John Barry&#8217;s beautiful score. I had forgotten how much of the film relied on Barry&#8217;s contribution and not just period tunes (there are actually very few songs in the film), and his effort is bittersweet and lovely &#8211; the antithesis to the nondescript, bland film music of today.Of course, Turner is wonderful as well, giving one of her finest performances, in a movie that offers a very interesting, mature take on a well-worn time travel premise. However, I honestly think the film would&#8217;ve been even more remembered and acclaimed had Cage delivered a performance that could&#8217;ve elevated the material onto a truly emotional level that it only intermittently flirts with.RLJ&#8217;s Blu-Ray of &#8220;Peggy Sue Got Married&#8221; includes an attractive 1080p AVC encode from the Sony vaults that does a fine job conveying the film&#8217;s color scheme and soft lighting&#8230;this isn&#8217;t an especially &#8220;crisp&#8221; looking transfer, but that has more to do with how the film was shot and not an issue with the mastering.

It had a lot of charm to it and romance, comedy and time-travel seem to be a good mixture.Also, it had an intriguing premise and made us think about it. If you could go back in time, knowing what you know now, would you do it and what would you do? I'm not talking short periods like in ""Groundhog Day"" (which was done seven years after this film) but if you could do it ALL over, from a certain point, like high school. Anyway, it's fun to think about.Nicholas Cage and Kathleen Turner were fun to watch. If you view this film today, be prepared to be shocked how young Cage - and Jim Carrey - look in here. Turner isn't so shocking only because today we don't see her in films regularly as we do those two guys. In fact, Turner was a big star in the '80s and most people remember her looks from that period, beginning with ""Body Heat"" (1981). She is the star of this film, too.When I last watched this, in the late 1990s, I found it wasn't as good as I remembered, but it still has a lot of charm and sentiment to it. It helps to be fascinated by time travel, which I am.If you are a film buff, you'll be shocked at all the familiar faces in this movie, from veteran actors like John Carradine to a young Helen Hunt. Check out the names in this cast! If you haven't seen this film, you owe it to yourself.

And ONE FROM THE HEART which was a huge flop, critical and  popular, is, in my opinion, a masterpiece, along with APOCALYPSE NOW and  THE GODFATHER, part I, II and III.Now why would Francis Coppola be  interested in the screenplay of PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED, a light and  nostalgic comedy about life and its disenchantments ? Perhaps the subject  touched him because of the recent fall of Zoetrope Studios which, at this  time, was falling apart with Coppola's dreams and money. In this  perspective, PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED is a formidable statement of a bleeding  director : &quot; If I could live again now, knowing what I know, I won't  change a thing ! &quot;.Speaking of perspective, let's observe that  there aren't any mirrors in the real world of Peggy Sue, Coppola choosing  to shoot the back of another actress when Kathleen Turner faces her mirror.  This creates an uneasiness in the audience because we have the impression  that Peggy Sue will jump out of the mirror. Great idea of an always  innovative director.You will have understood that PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED  is a movie you can watch several times and still discover another little  pearl hidden in it.

It's so hard to find scripts today with even average mature adult dialogue out of the US industry. Whenever I watch it it's always a treat to hear some great moments of dialogue that say so much with so few words and get you thinking if I was in there position revisiting my past...wouldn't that be interesting?Some people don't care for Nicolas' performance, but again, he has some excellent dialogue with Peggy. What a great script sharing thoughts of mature people but in a more light hearted way instead of reality TV conflicts.Kathleen does give a great performance but so do others. Barbara Harris, Joan Allen (where I first took notice of this excellent actress), Maureen O'Sullivan and then look for young Jim Carrey (not overplayed, overly comical, perfectly cast) and others.I would love to go back for a short visit my parents and grandparents and face what would I say to them knowing what I know now. This movie did that well without making it overly comical when say Marty goes back and visits his parents in Back to the Future. That's not to criticize Back to the Future, different kind of movie and I loved those scenes. Peggy Sue Got Married is a warmer fuzzier approach to what could be sci-fi plot, time travel no less. It really let's us know that we do change as we age, and sometimes that change results in a life that is incoherent with the past, especially the relationships we started with innocence and love, and precious honesty.

Yes, there are obvious cheesy characteristics that don't seem to belong in a Coppola film; however, this is an endearing film that I have watched many, many times.  It never gets old for me.The retro styling of this film is just part of the draw.  I also love the undertones of the film's theme:  what if?  I think most people look back at all of our stupid adolescent mistakes and wonder what would happen if we could go back and relive it.  Peggy Sue gets the chance, and finds that the choices that she originally made were not necessarily bad ones.  She and Charlie were drawn each other as teenagers, and even when she relives her high school years, she finds that the same is true.  She knows that he's flawed, and she also knows what the future will hold for them, but she couldn't deny that at that point in time, they were drawn toward each other for a reason.Do things happen for a reason?  If Charlie would have sung a Beatles song, would it have been as popular?  Peggy Sue tried to alter some of the aspects of her life, but she also seemed to find that she was powerless to alter the major parts.  She could chase the ""hip thinking"" poet, but could she truly be happy with him?  Could she walk away from Charlie and find happiness with someone else, thus altering what she knew to be her future?The plot is a bit hokey, but it does get you thinking.  If you did get a chance, would it really be all that different?  On one hand, you want to say yes, while on the other hand, we all know that time distorts our perception of things.  Would we really do it all differently if given the chance?  Perhaps not.

She also realises she can change the lives of those around her, such as when she encourages one class mate to invent panty-hose and encourages others to invest in things she knows will succeed in the future. Of course those around Peggy Sue are confused by her newly serious nature, particularly Charlie who cannot understand why she is so cool toward him.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film stars Nicholas Cage as Charlie and Kathleen Turner as Peggy Sue, and watch out for a very young Jim Carrey as Walter, a friend of the young couple.
