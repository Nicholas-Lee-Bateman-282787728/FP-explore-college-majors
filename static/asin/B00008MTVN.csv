745076,A1XPTVJC8OMM3I,B00008MTVN,Adam Teak Lagowski,"[5, 5]","As most of you know, SEX is now going into it's 6th and final season. Thankfully, the brilliance of this amazing show has been preserved on DVD (and VHS). From Miranda's pregnancy, to Charlotte's divorce, to Carrie's broken engagement, to Samantha's broken heart, the 4th season shows the girls proving that their characters go much deeper than just SEX. What I loved most about this season was how each lady endured a major event in her life, but still remained true to the very essence of her character. Samantha fell in love, yet still remained a 'wild child' of sorts. Carrie and Aidan became engaged, but she stilled remained the same insecure person she always was who loves to analyze everything to death. Miranda became pregnant, but found out that she enjoyed her life the way it was (with or without baby), and Charlotte remained a true believer in marriage and love (even though her fairly brief marriage fell apart). This has been a very careful balancing act on the part of the writers. Have the characters evolve, but allow them to stay true to who they really are. A tough job, but pulled off beautifully. This, I think, is what has kept the show so interesting. The characters themselves haven't changed. Instead, they have experienced a number of different situations in their lives which display their true, and deeper, colors.

The fourth season was more dramatic and profound and I absolutely loved it! My favorite episodes from this season include: The Real Me, Just Say Yes, Coulda Woulda Shoulda, Change of a Dress, and I Heart NY. Sarah Jessica Parker really shined this season as she said good-bye to Aidan and Big, while Cynthia Nixon's character became a mother, Kristen Davis' Charlotte ended her marriage to Trey, and Samantha fell in love with Richard and had her heart broken.

I would have to say that although i love watching the season where it all started and the final season, season four is the best.

745080,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00008MTVN,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[11, 11]","Based on the bestselling novel by Candace Bushnell, the HBO original series Sex And The City took the television world by storm following its release in the summer of 1998. Following the exploits of four young and educated female friends living and working in New York City, the show revolves around the various relationships and life problems experienced by each member of the group. Sporting an experienced and talented cast, the show has developed a strong, borderline fanatic following...Sarah Jessica Parker (the de facto lead character of the show) stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a popular sex columnist for a local newspaper who travels in numerous Manhattan social circles. Carrie is engaged in a tempestuous on-again, off-again relationship with a mystery man always referred to as ""Mr. Big"". The young urban professional shares her life with three best friends who have similarly interesting jobs - Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon), a lawyer tired of being single given the societal ramifications; Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), a promiscuous publicist who enjoys non-exclusive relationships; and Charlotte McDougal (Kristin Davis), an art museum curator who is relatively less open about her sexuality... Together, the women seek each other's advice on the ever-present and varying predicaments in which they find their romantic relationships...The Sex And The City (Season 4) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""The Agony and the 'Ex'stasy"" in which Carrie celebrates her 35th birthday. The milestone gives cause for the various women to reflect - Samantha is happy with her various sexual liaisons, Miranda realizes that marriage does not equate with happiness, Charlotte loses her appetite for Trey following a late night incident, and Carrie is disappointed when her dinner party bombs, but she perks up when Mr. Big arrives unannounced with a bottle of Champagne... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""Defining Moments"" in which each of the women defines a new set of boundaries in each of their various relationships, and ""Baby, Talk is Cheap"" in which Samantha meets a man who enjoys baby talk in bed and Charlotte and Trey decide against trying to conceive after attending a dinner party with their married friends and children...Below is a list of episodes included on the Sex And The City (Season 4) DVD:Episode 49 (The Agony and the 'Ex'stasy)Episode 50 (The Real Me)Episode 51 (Defining Moments)Episode 52 (What's Sex Got to Do With It?)Episode 53 (Ghost Town)Episode 54 (Baby, Talk is Cheap)Episode 55 (Time and Punishment)Episode 56 (My Motherboard, My Self)Episode 57 (Sex and the Country)Episode 58 (Belles of the Balls)Episode 59 (Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda)Episode 60 (Just Say Yes)Episode 61 (The Good Fight)Episode 62 (All That Glitters)Episode 63 (Change of a Dress)Episode 64 (Ring a Ding Ding)Episode 65 (A Vogue Idea)Episode 66 (I Heart NY)The DVD Report",5,One of the best original cable programs ever...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2927,"['Based', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'Candace', 'Bushnell', 'HBO', 'original', 'series', 'Sex', 'City', 'took', 'television', 'world', 'storm', 'following', 'release', 'summer', '1998', 'Following', 'exploits', 'four', 'young', 'educated', 'female', 'friends', 'living', 'working', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'show', 'various', 'relationships', 'life', 'problems', 'experienced', 'member', 'group', 'Sporting', 'experienced', 'talented', 'cast', 'show', 'developed', 'strong', 'borderline', 'fanatic', 'following', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'de', 'facto', 'lead', 'character', 'show', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'popular', 'sex', 'columnist', 'local', 'newspaper', 'who', 'numerous', 'Manhattan', 'social', 'circles', 'Carrie', 'engaged', 'tempestuous', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'relationship', 'mystery', 'man', 'always', 'referred', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'young', 'urban', 'professional', 'shares', 'life', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'similarly', 'interesting', 'jobs', 'Miranda', 'Hobbs', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'lawyer', 'tired', 'being', 'single', 'given', 'societal', 'ramifications', 'Samantha', 'Jones', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'promiscuous', 'publicist', 'who', 'non-exclusive', 'relationships', 'Charlotte', 'McDougal', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'art', 'museum', 'curator', 'who', 'relatively', 'less', 'open', 'sexuality', 'Together', 'women', 'seek', 'other', 'advice', 'ever-present', 'varying', 'predicaments', 'find', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'Sex', 'City', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Agony', ""'Ex'stasy"", 'Carrie', '35th', 'birthday', 'milestone', 'cause', 'various', 'women', 'reflect', 'Samantha', 'happy', 'various', 'sexual', 'liaisons', 'Miranda', 'marriage', 'not', 'equate', 'happiness', 'Charlotte', 'appetite', 'Trey', 'following', 'late', 'night', 'incident', 'Carrie', 'disappointed', 'when', 'dinner', 'party', 'bombs', 'up', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'unannounced', 'bottle', 'Champagne', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'include', 'Defining', 'Moments', 'women', 'new', 'set', 'boundaries', 'various', 'relationships', 'Baby', 'Talk', 'Cheap', 'Samantha', 'man', 'who', 'baby', 'talk', 'bed', 'Charlotte', 'Trey', 'decide', 'trying', 'conceive', 'attending', 'dinner', 'party', 'married', 'friends', 'children', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Sex', 'City', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'Episode', '49', 'Agony', ""'Ex'stasy"", 'Episode', '50', 'Real', 'Me', 'Episode', '51', 'Defining', 'Moments', 'Episode', '52', 'What', 'Sex', 'Got', 'Do', 'Episode', '53', 'Ghost', 'Town', 'Episode', '54', 'Baby', 'Talk', 'Cheap', 'Episode', '55', 'Time', 'Punishment', 'Episode', '56', 'My', 'Motherboard', 'My', 'Self', 'Episode', '57', 'Sex', 'Country', 'Episode', '58', 'Belles', 'Balls', 'Episode', '59', 'Coulda', 'Woulda', 'Shoulda', 'Episode', '60', 'Just', 'Say', 'Yes', 'Episode', '61', 'Good', 'Fight', 'Episode', '62', 'Glitters', 'Episode', '63', 'Change', 'Dress', 'Episode', '64', 'Ring', 'Ding', 'Ding', 'Episode', '65', 'A', 'Vogue', 'Idea', 'Episode', '66', 'Heart', 'NY', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

TV shows on DVD always seemed like a wonderful idea to me, so I began watching this series hoping to find something to indulge myself in. What I found was amazing. It only took me two days to get through the first set. I imediately rushed out to get Season Two and watched that in about a week. Thankfully for me, it was only about a month or so until Season Three came out. I watched season 3 savoring it as though it were my last breath of air. Since then I have seen a few episodes from Season Four (mostly the end of the season) and watched the disappointing 5th Season on HBO. I recently found out that you can download sex and the city episodes on Kazaa, but I'd rather wait and watch carrie & co. on the finest format available. I know my review wasn't very helpful as far as reviewing Season Four, but if you find yourself coming across this and you haven't ever seen Sex And The City, I urge you to drop whatever you're doing and pick up the first season. It's as good as everyone says it is. I can't imagine anyone not being able to identify with one of these four characters, if not all of them. The show is funny, refreshing, touching, smart and very endearing. At it's best, its all of these at the same time.

I usually write a little something about each season after watching it, but at this point, all I really have to add about the series as of the end of season four is this oft-repeated Amazon review phrase: if you've enjoyed the previous seasons, you'll enjoy this one, too.  Okay, I'll try to cobble together one new thought: this season is as funny and sexy as previous seasons, but the characters are now deeper and the situations a little more complex.  And the good thing is, the added nuance and resonance don't detract from the bawdiness, just make the whole package a little richer.On a somber note, the September 11 terrorist attacks occurred around the time that the fourth season of ""Sex and the City"" was unspooling on HBO, and it's sad to see the opening credits change somewhere mid-season, to remove images of the World Trade Center.  The latter part of the season wisely avoided a major, overt acknowledgement of that terrible day (it really wouldn't have fit in this frothy show), choosing instead to conclude the season with the episode ""I Heart New York"", a classy tribute to the timelessness and enduring charm of America's most famous city.

The lives of purported equals have many wrenches thrown in the works just by living life. I tend to take the show as a meditation on wonderfully diverse topics. I don't take it seriously, though some episodes have a certain ring of truth. And other episodes have a surprisingly shallow aspect to them.....gee, could there be shallow people out there? Or do we all occupy space on this planet with no baggage and utter pristine virtue?The characters are flawed, the stories are sometimes a little to tidy.

This year Carrie continues to be torn between Big and Aiden, with both men eventually physically fighting over her; Samantha starts to date a woman named Maria; Charlotte desperately wants to start a family, but discovers she only has a 15 percent chance of carrying full term; and Miranda deals with the death of her mother and Steve's cancer.Funny, witty, and daring are what makes ""Sex and the City: Season 4"" a standout.",5,"""Hello Girls!""",1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,668,"['Sex', 'City', 'thrive', 'fourth', 'season', 'originally', 'aired', 'HBO', '2001/2002', 'TV', 'season', 'set', '18', 'episodes', 'year', 'four', 'series', 'excellent', 'innovative', 'storylines', 'year', 'Carrie', 'be', 'torn', 'Big', 'Aiden', 'men', 'eventually', 'physically', 'fighting', 'Samantha', 'date', 'woman', 'named', 'Maria', 'Charlotte', 'desperately', 'start', 'family', 'only', '15', 'percent', 'chance', 'carrying', 'full', 'term', 'Miranda', 'deals', 'death', 'mother', 'Steve', 'cancer.Funny', 'witty', 'daring', 'are', 'what', 'Sex', 'City', 'Season', '4', 'standout']",N/A
745123,A268WAQS5WNMGJ,B00008MTVN,Thomas B. Gross,"[12, 17]","I did not really appreciate Sex and the City until watching every episode sequentially on DVD.  HBO tends to air random episodes out of sequence after their first showing and the show never really grabbed me until I discovered that there is actually plot and character development over time and not just endless brunches and mindless sex talk.  For example, I did not know that Big appeared in the series from the beginning, and I never knew that Aidan and Carrie had been engaged before I started watching the DVDs from the beginning.Anyway, that being said, I love this series and I would encourage anyone who has seen a few episodes and wondered what the fuss is about to take the time to watch the show from the beginning.The Writer's Commentary on a few episodes on this DVD is generally not worth the price of the DVDs, in my opinion.  He rarely tells us anything we couldn't notice ourselves, however, I had always wondered about the incident where Trey gives Charlotte a cardboard baby, which I understood as a plot device but thought was too tasteless a gesture to be plausible.  I should have guessed that the ""Cardboard Baby"" was based on an actual experience and an example of truth being stranger than fiction.",5,one interesting tidbit from the writer's commentary,1087776000,"06 21, 2004",2004,1223,"['did', 'not', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Sex', 'City', 'watching', 'episode', 'sequentially', 'DVD', 'HBO', 'air', 'random', 'sequence', 'first', 'showing', 'show', 'never', 'really', 'grabbed', 'discovered', 'actually', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'endless', 'brunches', 'mindless', 'sex', 'talk', 'example', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Big', 'appeared', 'series', 'beginning', 'never', 'knew', 'Aidan', 'Carrie', 'had', 'been', 'engaged', 'started', 'watching', 'DVDs', 'beginning.Anyway', 'being', 'said', 'love', 'series', 'would', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'few', 'episodes', 'wondered', 'what', 'fuss', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'show', 'beginning.The', 'Writer', 'Commentary', 'few', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'generally', 'not', 'price', 'DVDs', 'opinion', 'rarely', 'anything', 'could', ""n't"", 'notice', 'ourselves', 'however', 'had', 'always', 'wondered', 'incident', 'where', 'Trey', 'Charlotte', 'cardboard', 'baby', 'understood', 'plot', 'device', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'tasteless', 'gesture', 'be', 'plausible', 'should', 'have', 'guessed', 'Cardboard', 'Baby', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'experience', 'example', 'truth', 'being', 'stranger', 'fiction']",N/A
