Fruitsalad also hit the nail on the head saying a great blend of comedy and drama.here you have this hard-ass drug lord whose mother shames him into saving his soldier brother.  he has his, well, i can only describe him as a mayordomo, his mayordomo seek out a team to help in this undertaking.  the majordomo finds the most hard-ass criminals he can and convinces them to help julian find juan.the chemistry between the six guys is immediate.  they have one heart between them.  they're each one of them whacked in their own way, but they work as a perfect unit to achieve their goal.and there is enough seriousness to make the comedy even funnier.  one example i just busted out laughing is julian carrying juan and he hits juan's head on an overhanging pipe as they're running from the US soldiers who are shooting at them.i'm familiar with miguel rodarte, jaime camil, marius biegai, jes&uacute;s ochoa and joaqu&iacute;n cosio, and it was a treat to see them playing something a bit different, especially miguel and marius.  a truly cute and funny movie with a touch of serious, a bit of sweet and a little sad.  and a really cute dog!",5,&iexcl;tomate!,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,1328,"['what', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'saving', 'private', 'ryan', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'even', 'came', 'close', 'action', 'i', 'agree', '.fgd', 'who', 'said', 's/he', 'smiled', 'whole', 'movie', 'Fruitsalad', 'also', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'saying', 'great', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama.here', 'have', 'hard-ass', 'drug', 'lord', 'mother', 'saving', 'soldier', 'brother', 'well', 'i', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'mayordomo', 'mayordomo', 'seek', 'out', 'team', 'help', 'undertaking', 'majordomo', 'most', 'hard-ass', 'criminals', 'can', 'convinces', 'help', 'julian', 'find', 'juan.the', 'chemistry', 'six', 'guys', 'immediate', 'have', 'one', 'heart', ""'re"", 'one', 'whacked', 'own', 'way', 'work', 'perfect', 'unit', 'achieve', 'goal.and', 'enough', 'seriousness', 'make', 'comedy', 'even', 'funnier', 'one', 'example', 'i', 'just', 'busted', 'out', 'laughing', 'julian', 'carrying', 'juan', 'juan', 'head', 'overhanging', 'pipe', ""'re"", 'running', 'US', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'shooting', 'them.i', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'miguel', 'rodarte', 'jaime', 'camil', 'marius', 'biegai', 'jes', 'uacute', 'ochoa', 'joaqu', 'iacute', 'cosio', 'was', 'treat', 'see', 'playing', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'especially', 'miguel', 'marius', 'truly', 'cute', 'funny', 'movie', 'touch', 'serious', 'bit', 'sweet', 'little', 'sad', 'really', 'cute', 'dog']",N/A

Its kind of comedy action movie with decent production values. Or maybe national self-parody rather than comedy.

1505791,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B005ZEM8WY,Newton Ooi,"[3, 3]","The Mexican film industry is annually overshadowed by its behemoth up north.  Because of this, the Mexican film industry does not attract the funding needed to make international blockbusters, and has to rely on making thoroughly good films based on sound writing, casting, and acting.  This is one of those films.  Taking place in the modern world, the movie is about two brothers, Juan and Julian Perez.  The former is his mother's child, and follows the strict moral code of their mother.  The latter rises through the ranks of the Mexican drug industry to become the head of his own cartel.  Juan and mother immigrate to the US where the son joins the US Army and goes MIA in Iraq during the 2003 invasion.  Julian is sent to rescue him, and puts together a crack team of hit men and trusted servants to do so.  The meat of the movie is about this rescue mission, and the hilarity that follows.  Using cutting dialogue, some good action scenes, and adequate special effects; this movie is part A-Team, and part Saving Private Ryan.  Everything is in Spanish with English subtitles, so the viewer must pay attention to hone in on the drama between the key characters.  Overall, a very good and entertaining film.",4,Great Mexican version of an American classic,1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,1215,"['Mexican', 'film', 'industry', 'annually', 'overshadowed', 'behemoth', 'up', 'north', 'Mexican', 'film', 'industry', 'not', 'attract', 'funding', 'needed', 'make', 'international', 'blockbusters', 'rely', 'making', 'thoroughly', 'good', 'films', 'based', 'sound', 'writing', 'casting', 'acting', 'one', 'films', 'Taking', 'place', 'modern', 'world', 'movie', 'two', 'brothers', 'Juan', 'Julian', 'Perez', 'former', 'mother', 'child', 'strict', 'moral', 'code', 'mother', 'latter', 'rises', 'ranks', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'industry', 'become', 'head', 'own', 'cartel', 'Juan', 'mother', 'immigrate', 'US', 'where', 'son', 'US', 'Army', 'MIA', 'Iraq', '2003', 'invasion', 'Julian', 'sent', 'rescue', 'together', 'crack', 'team', 'hit', 'men', 'trusted', 'servants', 'do', 'so', 'meat', 'movie', 'rescue', 'mission', 'hilarity', 'Using', 'cutting', 'dialogue', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'adequate', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'part', 'A-Team', 'part', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Everything', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'viewer', 'must', 'pay', 'attention', 'hone', 'drama', 'key', 'characters', 'Overall', 'very', 'good', 'entertaining', 'film']",N/A

It was just so bizarre that it left me wondering whether the makers of this film were being serious or wether the whole thing was just supposed to be comically bizarre yet entertaining.
