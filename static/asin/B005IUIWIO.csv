1461954,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005IUIWIO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","There is actually a nifty and intriguing psychological drama that continually strains to emerge from the straight-to-DVD endeavor ""Carjacked."" There is certainly nothing new to the plotting of this thriller as a kidnapper and his abductee play a dangerous game of cat and mouse, but as portrayed by Stephen Dorff and Maria Bello--it's generally well acted and engaging. I love these movies that showcase a battle of wits and require an ordinary citizen to rise to new heights of courage and ingenuity. So I was willing to allow a fair amount of good will toward ""Carjacked."" Although the screenplay never really provided much believability, I still enjoyed the character interactions that headlined the first hour of this ninety minute movie. However, once we reach the last third--any pretense of rational, logical, sensible or real behavior is thrown out the car door for an incredibly awkward action finale. It's a serious miscalculation that pretty much erased any of the positive spin I had put on the beginning. I literally groaned in disbelief as the picture went solidly downhill.Bello plays the destitute and troubled mother of the likable Connor Hill. The movie wants to shortcut any subtle character development, so it starts with Bello attending a group therapy session. While grabbing some supplies and gas from a local convenience store (Note to producers: people in dire financial need probably wouldn't buy overpriced Bagel Bites from a convenience store. You ever shop groceries at a gas station? Not cheap.), she finds a strange man stowed in her car. Dorff is clearly evading some sort of law enforcement and persuades the family to drive him out of the area at gunpoint. The rest of the movie plays out fairly conventionally with the three getting to know one another in a relatively non-threatening way. As I said, I liked the interactions between Dorff and Hill and I thought some of the discussions between Dorff and Bello were quite well done. There are a few poorly staged escape moments, but overall--it's pretty decent. But the movie doesn't seem to know where to go.There are some laughably painful moments that are contingent on the trio meeting up with a grade school outing (which is happening at midnight, no less, isn't that always the case?). But you know that it's all been leading up to a final showdown. After some expected violence, Bello makes it to a public restaurant and the series of phone calls that she makes (and to whom she makes them) are perhaps the most ludicrously plotted scenario I've seen this year. But it gets better (or worse depending on your vantage point) as the picture ramps up for a bloody finale. Seriously, at the one hour point--any of the small pleasures to be derived from the movie go up in smoke. Super silly, but somewhat fun in the way of bad movie mayhem, I just couldn't be convinced to go with the flow. The picture started at about 3 1/2 stars and ended at about 1 1/2 stars, for me, so I really can't recommend it. If you like Bello or Dorff, this might be worth a look--but both have done better work.

1461956,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B005IUIWIO,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[4, 5]","Before I write this review I take full responsibility for watching this film. It's my fault and I deserve what I got. I have always loved Stephen Dorff and he is like a bad drug I can't kick. With every release he makes his movies get worse and I KNOW this yet I keep giving them a try.So I'm to blame for watching Carjacked. It's not even like I expect Stephen's movies to be good now. The last twenty have been terrible so I lost expectations back when he made Steal AKA Riders.Sigh. What can I say about this movie? Okay, it's bad. Which I am sure we all know. It's not as bad as some of Stephen's movies but that's not a compliment seeing how awful some of his movies have been.There are tons of problems with Carjacked. It's boring, it's predictable, it's slow, it's pathetic and I could go on forever.SPOILER ALERT!Roy (Dorff) carjacks Lorraine (Maria Bella, who I liked before seeing her in this and now I will run from her movies from now on) and her son Chad at a gas station. They spend the first hour of the movie bonding like they are on an inspirational field trip. At one time I expected them to start singing Kumbaya. A movie like this is supposed to be a thriller but it's hard to be on edge when the main character is chatting it up with her kidnapper like they're in Hawaii.Lorraine never tried to get away until almost the end of the film. The direction was horrible but the character development was shameful. That's what I absolutely could not forgive.At the beginning, Roy acts like Lorraine's best friend. He even seems compassionate about her ex-husband and the life she's led. Roy even takes to Chad. I mean it's obvious that he cares. But after the first hour it's like the writers went, ""Oh yeah, he's supposed to be a bad guy."" So we get this huge switch concerning Roy just at the spur of the moment. One minute he's opening up to Lorraine about his background and the next he's stuffing her into the hood of a car and burning her alive. It didn't make any sense.This is a bad, bad movie. I am going to vow not to watch another Stephen Dorff picture again and I suggest you do the same for your sanity if not anyone else's.I keep hoping that things will get better but Dorff has gone down the drain of D-movie status and looks like there's no possible chance of rescuing him.Sad.

Thus begins a strange journey, as Roy is bound for a rendezvous with his partner, several hours drive away.Watching Carjacked is a strange experience that is disassociated from reality.  Lorraine doesn't seem to be very seriously concerned about the safety of her son, engaging in some really strange conversations with her captor.  She doesn't appear to be trying to trick or distract Roy, but seems to be generally engaged, as the writers seem to be enamored with displaying their talents for dialog.  Lorraine is portrayed as someone who isn't the clearest thinker, as she mistakenly dials 411 instead of 911, when she has a brief opportunity to be alone.  Like his mother, Chad doesn't seem to be the brightest kid, and displays little fear as well.For a supposedly desperate man, Roy is one talkative kidnapper, and seemingly very interested in playing with Lorraine's head.  After clearing a police roadblock, there would seem to be better and faster ways for him to get to his destination, but he still sticks with Lorraine and her clunker of a car.  Only after Lorraine figures out a way to get her son out of danger, do things turn very nasty, and the film becomes something of a roller coaster.  After Lorraine miraculously manages to avoid being incinerated, she sees Roy kidnapping a mother and daughter, and goes into action hero mode for what is one insane and extreme finish.With quirky characters who seem to be living in an alternate reality, Carjacked is an entertaining, but strange disjointed ride.  Written by a husband and wife team collaborating on their first film, the story isn't very credible, but has the kind of over the top finish that Hollywood seems to favor.  Maria Bello (Payback,A History of Violence) and Stephen Dorff (Immortals,Blade) both do a nice job of delivering exactly the kind of performances that the screenplay calls for, however you may need to be in a very undemanding frame of mind to really enjoy this movie, which stretches reality severely, while putting a warped spin on empowerment.",3,"an abduction tale that ramps up, and then flies over a cliff...",1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,2342,"['Maria', 'Bello', 'Lorraine', 'Burton', 'woman', 'who', 'lot', 'mind', 'primarily', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'custody', 'young', 'son', 'Chad', 'Connor', 'Hill', 'stopped', 'convenience', 'store', 'car', 'find', 'Roy', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'bank', 'robber', 'run', 'back', 'seat', 'gun', 'Thus', 'strange', 'journey', 'Roy', 'bound', 'rendezvous', 'partner', 'several', 'hours', 'drive', 'away.Watching', 'Carjacked', 'strange', 'experience', 'disassociated', 'reality', 'Lorraine', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'seriously', 'concerned', 'safety', 'son', 'engaging', 'really', 'strange', 'conversations', 'captor', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'trying', 'trick', 'distract', 'Roy', 'be', 'generally', 'engaged', 'writers', 'seem', 'be', 'enamored', 'displaying', 'talents', 'dialog', 'Lorraine', 'portrayed', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'clearest', 'thinker', 'mistakenly', '411', 'instead', '911', 'when', 'brief', 'opportunity', 'be', 'alone', 'mother', 'Chad', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'brightest', 'kid', 'little', 'fear', 'well.For', 'supposedly', 'desperate', 'man', 'Roy', 'one', 'talkative', 'kidnapper', 'seemingly', 'very', 'interested', 'playing', 'Lorraine', 'head', 'clearing', 'police', 'roadblock', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'better', 'faster', 'ways', 'get', 'destination', 'still', 'Lorraine', 'clunker', 'car', 'Only', 'Lorraine', 'out', 'way', 'get', 'son', 'danger', 'do', 'things', 'turn', 'very', 'nasty', 'film', 'something', 'roller', 'coaster', 'Lorraine', 'miraculously', 'avoid', 'being', 'incinerated', 'Roy', 'kidnapping', 'mother', 'daughter', 'action', 'hero', 'mode', 'what', 'one', 'insane', 'extreme', 'finish.With', 'quirky', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'living', 'alternate', 'reality', 'Carjacked', 'entertaining', 'strange', 'disjointed', 'ride', 'Written', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', 'collaborating', 'first', 'film', 'story', ""n't"", 'very', 'credible', 'kind', 'top', 'finish', 'Hollywood', 'favor', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Payback', 'A', 'History', 'Violence', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'Immortals', 'Blade', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'delivering', 'exactly', 'kind', 'performances', 'screenplay', 'however', 'may', 'need', 'be', 'very', 'undemanding', 'frame', 'mind', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'reality', 'severely', 'putting', 'warped', 'spin', 'empowerment']",N/A
