642319,A33CGUK6890TP3,B00005JOO3,Andre Ali Seewood,"[2, 2]","Richter's Agenda is a dark and disturbing suspense thriller marred by a certain emptiness at its core.  The film itself is in Black & White and underlit.  This is quite effective, visually.  But the thin characterization of the victim (perhaps a consequence of the short format) ruins the sequence where she is supposed to be terrified.  It really has something to do with the story of her ""kinda"" boyfriend that she doesn't go into enough to make us feel for her as a person.  Yet there is enough creepiness in this work to recall the dark work of David Lynch (Lost Highway) and even Mulholland Drive, I just wish there could have been more attention to the characterization of the victim- before her untimely demise.",3,A Dark & Disturbing Thriller,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,718,"['Richter', 'Agenda', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'marred', 'certain', 'emptiness', 'core', 'film', 'Black', 'White', 'underlit', 'quite', 'effective', 'visually', 'thin', 'characterization', 'victim', 'perhaps', 'consequence', 'short', 'format', 'sequence', 'where', 'supposed', 'be', 'terrified', 'really', 'something', 'do', 'story', 'kinda', 'boyfriend', ""n't"", 'go', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', 'person', 'enough', 'creepiness', 'work', 'recall', 'dark', 'work', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'even', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'just', 'wish', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'attention', 'characterization', 'victim-', 'untimely', 'demise']",Richter's Agenda Theatrical Release

Cute girl + instant messenger service + psycho maniac killer = suspenseful thriller. I guess you beat me to it.Yeah, the plot is not 100% original, but what movie has a completely 100% original plot anymore? Also, keep in mind the saying, ""Great minds think alike.""I agree with the other viewers when it comes to the fact that the film is a little too dark, although I didn't take off for this because I feel that this may be at least partially because the film has been compressed for the internet and is being viewed in a small space. Also, the background for Amazon.com is white which I am sure probably doesn't help matters that much. Perhaps if I was viewing this on my TV player at home things would look better.I really liked how you could build up the suspense in such short amount of time. One of the things that realy helps this is the sound you chose to use for the instant messenger program. I found it to be really effective and I belive that it is a key ingredient for this film and one that will probably be overlooked by many. At fuirst it sounds like just any ordinary computer beep, but by the end it's frightening.The actress did a great job as well. Kudos to her on an oustanding preformance. As stated earlier, it is really difficult to carry a movie like this (or any other movie for that matter) almost entirely by yourself.The first time I watched this, at the very end, even though I knew it was coming, I had to cover my eyes. That's a good sign.Hope to see more from you in the future.",5,You stole my movie!,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,1636,"['just', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'am', 'stages', 'planning', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'short', 'necesarily', 'still', 'Cute', 'girl', '+', 'instant', 'messenger', 'service', '+', 'psycho', 'maniac', 'killer', '=', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'guess', 'beat', 'it.Yeah', 'plot', 'not', '100', '%', 'original', 'what', 'movie', 'completely', '100', '%', 'original', 'plot', 'anymore', 'Also', 'keep', 'mind', 'saying', 'Great', 'think', 'alike', 'agree', 'other', 'viewers', 'when', 'fact', 'film', 'little', 'too', 'dark', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'off', 'feel', 'may', 'be', 'least', 'partially', 'film', 'been', 'compressed', 'internet', 'being', 'viewed', 'small', 'space', 'Also', 'background', 'Amazon.com', 'white', 'am', 'sure', 'probably', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'much', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'viewing', 'TV', 'player', 'home', 'things', 'would', 'look', 'better.I', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'could', 'build', 'up', 'suspense', 'such', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'One', 'things', 'realy', 'sound', 'chose', 'use', 'instant', 'messenger', 'program', 'found', 'be', 'really', 'effective', 'belive', 'key', 'ingredient', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'overlooked', 'many', 'fuirst', 'like', 'just', 'ordinary', 'computer', 'beep', 'end', 'frightening.The', 'actress', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'Kudos', 'oustanding', 'preformance', 'stated', 'earlier', 'really', 'difficult', 'carry', 'movie', 'other', 'movie', 'matter', 'almost', 'entirely', 'yourself.The', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'very', 'end', 'even', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'had', 'cover', 'eyes', 'good', 'sign.Hope', 'see', 'more', 'future']",Richter's Agenda Theatrical Release

Mandy's performance is definitely up there with the classic scream queens.Suspense takes time and I am impressed at how well paced this short film is. The shots are well composed and the lighting, although dark at times, is effective in creating a dense, shadowy, almost claustrophobic atmosphere.

I think the thing about Hitchcock that I liked so much is that he did not rely on ""Supernatural"" events such as unplugged computers powering up and connecting to the internet.

The standout element of this film for me though was the main actress. She is incredibly beautiful in a ""girl next door"" sort of way and that part alone makes this short film worth watching. I liked the use of black and white instead of color to add effect. I liked the use of the IM tool in the film, that worked really well I thought.The only thing I didn't like is that the story was just too predictable. It seemed too much like a knock off of the early 80's slasher film concept and lacked any story line originality in that respect. Had the writer thrown in a couple more unexpected twists and turns, it would have been a much more compelling film. Not bad though, not bad at all.
