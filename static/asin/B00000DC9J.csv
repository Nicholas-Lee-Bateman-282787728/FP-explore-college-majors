It's not funny all the way through but when it is funny it's FUNNY!Second, from a historical perspective it's very interesting. The first 15 minutes is a recycled silent film, which transitions to Mr. Lloyds first talkie. So it bridges the era's.Third how can you not see a film involving BOTH Sturges AND Lloyd? Not to mention the cream of the crop of supporting character actors. Conlin was never better, he's a great guy but you don't want to trust him one inch! The plot line is so inventive and outrageous you'll never ever guess what is coming next!Fourth, like all Lloyd and most of Sturges this is a film with it's morals completely out for the average guy. The guy with the good heart. The guy who means well and will take his honest goodness to the limit and by persevering he wins. In this case his true love Francis Ramsden. I fell in love with Francis. While not the most gorgeous of actresses in that era you just have to love her. She loves Harold despite himself because of what is inside of him. However it's never corny or saccharin. It's almost bittersweet until the end. Harold IS a loser in many ways but in the way that matters most he's a winner.Fifth - the last line of the movie. I won't spoil it for you but you have to pay attention. In fact this is not a movie for those who don't pay attention.People who don't pay attention are not going to ""get this movie.""

495762,A1JCN10T0TPOPH,B00000DC9J,"Esn024 ""esn024""","[9, 19]","Anybody who watches this expecting an example of what made Harold Lloyd the most popular comedian of the 20s (no, it wasn't Chaplin) will be sorely dissappointed, and may even think that his earlier films are not worth watching.  The truth is, this &quot;comeback film&quot; is nowhere near the quality of his earlier silent films, and especially not &quot;The Freshman&quot;, to which this is supposed to be a sequel.The problem with this film starts with the first 30 minutes; they are typical of a director whose style is completely inconsistent with Lloyd's trademark 1920s optimism.  The first 30 minutes of this film (the footage from &quot;The Freshman&quot; excepted) are spent ridiculing in its entirity the philosophy that made Lloyd's previous films so fun to watch; his go-getter mentality, always making the best of a bad situation.  The first part of this movie starts out slowly and depressingly, portraying Harold as a miserable loser who's been in the same job for 30 years who comes to work one day and gets fired.Sound like comedy gold to you? Me neither.  It's really not the type of thing that Harold's character is best suited to, and it was only through the faint hope that something better might lie ahead that I kept watching.  Thankfully, the movie does get better after the bar scene, where Harold has the first drink of his life and metamorphosizes into something resembling his old character again (he bets on a horse-race against incredible odds and wins a whole load of money, which he promptly uses to buy a circus).  From there on, there are a few very funny gags (the best of them having to do with a lion), although there are also too many hysterics on Harold's part for my taste; something that wasn't present in his earlier silent movies. The final scene of the movie pays homage to Harold Lloyd's climb up the side of a building in his 1923 &quot;Safety Last&quot;.I'm pretty sure that the only reason that this film's reputation has gotten this high is that almost all of Harold's other films have been owned by his family and though well-preserved, withheld from public view (aside from a limited-release VHS run in the early 90s and regular showings on TCM for those who get it).  This is truly a shame, because his earlier works, unlike THIS uneven piece of filmmaking, are truly great comedic masterpieces on a level with the best of Chaplin's and Keaton's films.  I dare anyone who's watched &quot;Safety Last&quot;, &quot;The Freshman&quot;, or &quot;The Kid Brother&quot; to say otherwise.HOWEVER, EXTREMELY good news have recently been announced on the forum of the Harold Lloyd Trust's official website.  On October 6th, Annette Lloyd announced on behalf of Suzanne Lloyd (Harold's granddaughter) that after more than 5 years of waiting a DVD deal has finally been signed with New Line Entertainment for Harold's older films, as well as a theatrical release deal with Sony.  This deal seemed to come out of nowhere, and completely shocked Harold Lloyd fans who thought that the Trust was sitting on their laurels while badly mishandling the situation.Thankfully, Harold will be more visible soon than he has been in the last 50 years!

495764,A1J5TC13BSPA2M,B00000DC9J,"James Simpson ""James Simpson""","[1, 1]","Harold Lloyd's ""The Sin of Harold Diddlebock"" is a film that promised so much more than what was actually delivered. The fascinating premise of catching up to the young go getter of the 20s in middle age could(and should) have made for an imperishable Comedy classic. Instead it's merely a curio piece and a film of missed oppurtunities.The film begins with footage from Lloyd's masterpiece, the unforgettable,"" The Freshman(1925)"" and the rest of the film can't really hope to top such an elaborate and wonderful opening. Lloyd, shortly after his victory at the game is taken in by Raymond Walburn to work for him.Lloyd is typically full of enthusiasm and expects a bright future. Over twenty years later and he's down and out and shabby. He's fired from his job and is down on his luck. A moving scene shows him admitting his affection for the office girl he loved from afar(the beautiful Frances Ramsdem) whom he had also fallen for all her identically beautiful sisters. He gives her an engagement ring that he planned to eventually give to one of her sisters and walks off. This is a beautifully handled scene that melds wit with sentiment, but unfortunately is not that explored in this film.Lloyd eventually runs into Jimmy Conlin, who takes him to get his first drink, served by bartender Edgar Kennedy.The drink causes Lloyd to howl and become a big shot who  goes on the town and become a winner. However, when the buzz wears off he finds that he remembers nothing!His ""mad Wednesday"" over, he discovers that he's the owner of a circus!From here on in, the film focuses on Lloyd's attempts to sell off his new found circus to mixed comical reaction. There's even a stunt sequence with a lion on a ledge that compares to the 20s comedies of old. All ends well and Lloyd reunites with Ramsdem with a sweet scene in a carriage as they admit that they love each other.It's certainly a pleasant film, but The Sin of Harold Lloyd lacks in several departments.First of all, this is not exactly a sequel to ""The Freshman"" as some claim. THe character is under a different name and is totally unrelated to that film. Lloyd's character is more of a generalization for the KIND of charcater that he portrayed in those silent comedies.Credit must be given to the make-up artists(and it is in the film's end) that Lloyd still looks so remarkably like his character from the past. ESpecially when you consider that he had not been in a film up to this point for nearly ten years. It's because of Lloyd's charm that we accept the romance of him and a younger woman so simply. It's unfortunate that the romance is not given more screen time, espeically considering that the romantic element had always been the heart of his films and the two scenes with Ramsdem are the sweetest in the film. She was a truly beautiful and likeable actress and it's unfortunate that this was her final screen appearance.The cast is composed of largely members of Preston Sturges stock company and many great comic actors are within. All are wonderful, but the material does not neccesarily play to there strengths within. Still, most give this a game try and make there scenes watchable.The film's climax seems rushed and farcial and does not come off the way it should. This is especially true in comparsion to truly insane conclusions that ended many of Lloyd's earlier films. Still, it's pleasant enough that it just passes. Still, it's not highly memorable, especially when up to classics like Safety Last(1923), The Kid Brother(1927), Speedy(1928) and Movie Crazy(1932).One reason that the film may not seem so perfect is that it had a reportedly chaotic production, a trademark of the eccentric Howard Hughes, who was producer of the film. Director Preston Sturges who had made several masterpieces in the early part of the decade was washed up by this time and perhaps saw this film as a comeback. For Lloyd, this would be a return to form and the pairing of the two comedy greats promised to be a great one. Unfortunately, the writing was not nearly up to both mens' greatest works and it remains just an odd footnote in film history.It's a shame that this public domain film is not available in a better print as this one is not great. Considering the fascinating history of this film, commentary or a small documentary would be welcome.",3,Bookend to wonderful career of great comedian is a mixed blessing.,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,4322,"['Harold', 'Lloyd', 'Sin', 'Harold', 'Diddlebock', 'film', 'promised', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'delivered', 'fascinating', 'premise', 'catching', 'up', 'young', 'go', 'getter', '20s', 'middle', 'age', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'imperishable', 'Comedy', 'classic', 'Instead', 'merely', 'curio', 'piece', 'film', 'missed', 'oppurtunities.The', 'film', 'footage', 'Lloyd', 'masterpiece', 'unforgettable', 'Freshman', '1925', 'rest', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'hope', 'top', 'elaborate', 'wonderful', 'opening', 'Lloyd', 'shortly', 'victory', 'game', 'taken', 'Raymond', 'Walburn', 'work', 'him.Lloyd', 'typically', 'full', 'enthusiasm', 'bright', 'future', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'down', 'shabby', 'fired', 'job', 'down', 'luck', 'moving', 'scene', 'admitting', 'affection', 'office', 'girl', 'loved', 'afar', 'beautiful', 'Frances', 'Ramsdem', 'whom', 'had', 'also', 'fallen', 'identically', 'beautiful', 'sisters', 'engagement', 'ring', 'planned', 'eventually', 'give', 'one', 'sisters', 'walks', 'off', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'scene', 'wit', 'sentiment', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'explored', 'film.Lloyd', 'eventually', 'Jimmy', 'Conlin', 'who', 'get', 'first', 'drink', 'served', 'bartender', 'Edgar', 'Kennedy.The', 'drink', 'Lloyd', 'howl', 'become', 'big', 'shot', 'who', 'town', 'become', 'winner', 'However', 'when', 'buzz', 'nothing', 'mad', 'Wednesday', 'owner', 'circus', 'here', 'film', 'Lloyd', 'attempts', 'sell', 'off', 'new', 'found', 'circus', 'mixed', 'comical', 'reaction', 'even', 'stunt', 'sequence', 'lion', 'ledge', '20s', 'comedies', 'old', 'well', 'Lloyd', 'Ramsdem', 'sweet', 'scene', 'carriage', 'admit', 'love', 'other.It', 'certainly', 'pleasant', 'film', 'Sin', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'several', 'departments.First', 'not', 'exactly', 'sequel', 'Freshman', 'claim', 'THe', 'character', 'different', 'name', 'totally', 'unrelated', 'film', 'Lloyd', 'character', 'more', 'generalization', 'KIND', 'charcater', 'portrayed', 'silent', 'comedies.Credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'make-up', 'artists', 'film', 'end', 'Lloyd', 'still', 'so', 'remarkably', 'character', 'past', 'ESpecially', 'when', 'consider', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'film', 'up', 'point', 'nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'Lloyd', 'charm', 'accept', 'romance', 'younger', 'woman', 'so', 'simply', 'unfortunate', 'romance', 'not', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'espeically', 'considering', 'romantic', 'element', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'heart', 'films', 'two', 'scenes', 'Ramsdem', 'are', 'sweetest', 'film', 'was', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'likeable', 'actress', 'unfortunate', 'was', 'final', 'screen', 'appearance.The', 'cast', 'composed', 'largely', 'members', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'stock', 'company', 'many', 'great', 'comic', 'actors', 'are', 'are', 'wonderful', 'material', 'not', 'neccesarily', 'play', 'strengths', 'Still', 'most', 'give', 'game', 'try', 'make', 'scenes', 'watchable.The', 'film', 'climax', 'rushed', 'farcial', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'way', 'should', 'especially', 'true', 'comparsion', 'truly', 'insane', 'conclusions', 'ended', 'many', 'Lloyd', 'earlier', 'films', 'Still', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'just', 'Still', 'not', 'highly', 'memorable', 'especially', 'when', 'up', 'classics', 'Safety', 'Last', '1923', 'Kid', 'Brother', '1927', 'Speedy', '1928', 'Movie', 'Crazy', '1932', '.One', 'reason', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'perfect', 'had', 'reportedly', 'chaotic', 'production', 'trademark', 'eccentric', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'who', 'was', 'producer', 'film', 'Director', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'several', 'masterpieces', 'early', 'part', 'decade', 'was', 'washed', 'up', 'time', 'perhaps', 'saw', 'film', 'comeback', 'Lloyd', 'would', 'be', 'return', 'form', 'pairing', 'two', 'comedy', 'greats', 'promised', 'be', 'great', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'writing', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'up', 'mens', 'greatest', 'works', 'just', 'odd', 'footnote', 'film', 'history.It', 'shame', 'public', 'domain', 'film', 'not', 'available', 'better', 'print', 'one', 'not', 'great', 'Considering', 'fascinating', 'history', 'film', 'commentary', 'small', 'documentary', 'would', 'be', 'welcome']",Mad Wednesday VHS

Occasionally, I find a real gem I will want to see over and over again. This one falls into the first category.Harold Diddlebock was an unlikely football hero in 1923. Because he helped to win the big game, he got a job working for a big sports fan. He was excited by the prospect but it was a stagnant, dead end. Now, 20 years later, he has been terminated and has no prospects. All he has is a few thousand dollars from his retirement fund in his pocket and a serious crush on a young lady who works for the firm. He has sequentially fallen in love with each of her older sisters as they have worked for the same firm over the years.Harold is a teetotaler but when he is wondering the streets unsure of what to do, he allows a friendly bum to coax him into a bar where he has his first drink, a special concoction brewed especially for him. Depending on your perspective, he handles his liquor not at all or extremely well. When he wakes up, he finds that his money is gone and he cannot remember what has taken place. As he tries to recover his memories and his money, he learns more and more of the antics of his blackout and becomes ever more disheartened at what he learns. He was a real wild man and it is unfortunate he cannot remember what a good time he had.As he tries to repair the damage, he stumbles from one silly situation to the next in a typical mid-20th century comedic fashion.Alls well that ends well and the girl is really sweet too.There is nothing memorable about this one but it was fun while it lasted.",3,Inoffensive and Inauspicious,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,1657,"['tend', 'like', 'really', 'obscure', 'really', 'old', 'movies', 'Most', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'last', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'when', 'are', 'Occasionally', 'find', 'real', 'gem', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'over', 'again', 'one', 'first', 'category.Harold', 'Diddlebock', 'was', 'unlikely', 'football', 'hero', '1923', 'helped', 'win', 'big', 'game', 'got', 'job', 'working', 'big', 'sports', 'fan', 'was', 'excited', 'prospect', 'was', 'stagnant', 'dead', 'end', 'Now', '20', 'years', 'later', 'been', 'terminated', 'prospects', 'few', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'retirement', 'fund', 'pocket', 'serious', 'crush', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'firm', 'sequentially', 'fallen', 'love', 'older', 'sisters', 'have', 'worked', 'same', 'firm', 'years.Harold', 'teetotaler', 'when', 'wondering', 'streets', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'friendly', 'bum', 'coax', 'bar', 'where', 'first', 'drink', 'special', 'concoction', 'brewed', 'especially', 'Depending', 'perspective', 'liquor', 'not', 'extremely', 'well', 'When', 'up', 'money', 'gone', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'what', 'taken', 'place', 'recover', 'memories', 'money', 'more', 'more', 'antics', 'blackout', 'ever', 'more', 'disheartened', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'wild', 'man', 'unfortunate', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'what', 'good', 'time', 'repair', 'damage', 'one', 'silly', 'situation', 'next', 'typical', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'comedic', 'fashion.Alls', 'well', 'well', 'girl', 'really', 'sweet', 'nothing', 'memorable', 'one', 'was', 'fun', 'lasted']",Mad Wednesday VHS

When he's let go, he removes every last one of them and takes them with him, so as not to forget the truth of what life is all about.  Or at least those parts of life for which these adages apply.Thus, our hero is a rather, shall we say, by the book kinda guy.  So when he goes on an unintentional bender, this radical restructuring of his brain molecules brings about some decidedly unexpected results.  He buys a plaid suit loud enough to wake people living on the other side of the world.  He buys a cowboy hat big enough to double as a doghouse for a Doberman pinscher (or however you spell that darn dog's name).  And he buys a circus, too.Yep, a circus--one of the main attractions of which is Jackie the lion.  Jackie means well, but her bark (roar, is more like it) is definitely worse than her bite.  In fact, her bite never happens, but the bark/roar is there a lot of the time.  This gets Harold into big trouble, and therein lies the rub.One of the best screwball comedies of the 40s (made in 1947), The Sin of Harold Diddlebock should not be missed by fans of great comedy.  Well folks, we now have Sullivan's Travels, The Sin of Harold Diddlebock, and The Lady Eve on DVD.  There's talk of Palm Beach Story following in the relatively near future--hopefully true, since that is a pure gem.

495769,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B00000DC9J,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[1, 1]","After doing a string of talking pictures in the 30's (some well received, others, not so lucky), silent comedian Harold Lloyd quietly retired from the big screen. Then came one last hurrah: Writer-director Preston Sturges lured Lloyd back with ""The Sin of Harold Diddlebock"" (later retitled ""Mad Wednesday""), a sort of screwball comedy which didn't do that well upon its initial release, but has gained cult status over the years as the last Lloyd film.It begins promisingly; showing footage from the classic football game climax of 1925's ""The Freshman"", an ad boss in the crowd is so impressed with Harold that he offers him an office job at his firm, believing that the young man will do nothing but excel. Lloyd's films usually showed unyielding optimism as his character strived to be a success, one way or another. Isn't it ironic that here, the passage of time reveals Diddlebock has done nothing more than toil away at his desk for 20 or 30 years, a stoop-shouldered man who has lost his passion & idealism. Dysappointed that he hasn't progressed in such a long time, the boss fires a stunned Diddlebock, and on a chance encounter with diminutive Jimmy Conlin, H.D. has his first drink. But it's no ordinary drink, as it causes H.D. to black out for several hours. Soon, it's revealed he went on an uncharacteristically wild bend, during which he bought a circus! Transformation of character was always one of Lloyd's staples, and here, it's no different as H.D. is turned from mouse into man, throwing caution to the wind.It's amazing that physically, Lloyd has hardly changed at all in 20-odd years since his silent days; he looks fit & youthful here. It's also helped that Sturges has armed each & every scene with sterling dialogue & surrounded Lloyd with a top-notch cast of supporting actors: Conlin, Rudy Vallee, Margaret Hamilton (already famous as the Wicked Witch in ""The Wizard of Oz""), Franklin Pangborn, and Edgar Kennedy (remember him from the Laurel & Hardy comedies and the Marx Brothers' ""Duck Soup""?). The climax with Lloyd dangling from the chain of his pet lion Jackie over a building ledge is surprisingly well done, a pleasing echo of his silent work from such films as ""Safety Last"".Not a perfect film, as the film loses momentum for a while after ""The Freshman"" footage (which is so energetic & funny in comparison) but recovers with the infamous bar scene as Lloyd yowls his head off with the first drink. Also, too bad they didn't digitally restore this film, as it looks dark in places. Still, not a bad movie for Lloyd to exit on!",4,Harold Lloyd exits with a yowl,1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,2566,"['doing', 'string', 'talking', 'pictures', '30', 'well', 'received', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'lucky', 'silent', 'comedian', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'quietly', 'retired', 'big', 'screen', 'Then', 'came', 'one', 'last', 'hurrah', 'Writer-director', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'lured', 'Lloyd', 'back', 'Sin', 'Harold', 'Diddlebock', 'later', 'retitled', 'Mad', 'Wednesday', 'sort', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'initial', 'release', 'gained', 'cult', 'status', 'years', 'last', 'Lloyd', 'film.It', 'promisingly', 'showing', 'footage', 'classic', 'football', 'game', 'climax', '1925', 'Freshman', 'ad', 'boss', 'crowd', 'so', 'impressed', 'Harold', 'office', 'job', 'firm', 'believing', 'young', 'man', 'will', 'do', 'nothing', 'excel', 'Lloyd', 'films', 'usually', 'showed', 'unyielding', 'optimism', 'character', 'strived', 'be', 'success', 'one', 'way', ""n't"", 'ironic', 'here', 'passage', 'time', 'reveals', 'Diddlebock', 'done', 'nothing', 'more', 'toil', 'away', 'desk', '20', '30', 'years', 'stoop-shouldered', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'passion', 'idealism', 'Dysappointed', ""n't"", 'progressed', 'such', 'long', 'time', 'boss', 'stunned', 'Diddlebock', 'chance', 'encounter', 'diminutive', 'Jimmy', 'Conlin', 'H.D', 'first', 'drink', 'ordinary', 'drink', 'H.D', 'black', 'out', 'several', 'hours', 'Soon', 'revealed', 'went', 'uncharacteristically', 'wild', 'bend', 'bought', 'circus', 'Transformation', 'character', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'Lloyd', 'staples', 'here', 'different', 'H.D', 'turned', 'mouse', 'man', 'throwing', 'caution', 'wind.It', 'amazing', 'physically', 'Lloyd', 'hardly', 'changed', '20-odd', 'years', 'silent', 'days', 'fit', 'youthful', 'here', 'also', 'helped', 'Sturges', 'armed', 'scene', 'sterling', 'dialogue', 'surrounded', 'Lloyd', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Conlin', 'Rudy', 'Vallee', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'already', 'famous', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Franklin', 'Pangborn', 'Edgar', 'Kennedy', 'remember', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'comedies', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Duck', 'Soup', 'climax', 'Lloyd', 'dangling', 'chain', 'pet', 'lion', 'Jackie', 'building', 'ledge', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'pleasing', 'echo', 'silent', 'work', 'such', 'films', 'Safety', 'Last', '.Not', 'perfect', 'film', 'film', 'momentum', 'while', 'Freshman', 'footage', 'so', 'energetic', 'funny', 'comparison', 'recovers', 'infamous', 'bar', 'scene', 'Lloyd', 'head', 'first', 'drink', 'Also', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'digitally', 'restore', 'film', 'dark', 'places', 'Still', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'Lloyd', 'exit']",Mad Wednesday VHS

Harold complies, despite the fact that he's just been fired from his job.The inspired bartender concurs with Wormy that Harold needs a drink to ease his troubles and---in a scene only Preston Sturges could have written---creates a ""Diddlebock"" in his honor.Originally entitled 'The Sin of Harold Diddlebock', the real sin is in being unable to rent it in most video stores.  This has got to be one of the top comedies ever made.Lloyd came out of retirement to make this film after meeting and befriending kindred maniac, Preston Sturges.In ""Mad Wednesday""  Lloyd performs some of the funniest sight gags ever captured on celluloid, employing his trademark high-risk stunts. (Ever see 'Safety Last'?) Houdini would have been proud.In all his movies Lloyd played a hopelessly naive gung-ho optimist who triumphed against the world despite his childlike sweetness.But here the formula takes a twist, thanks to Sturges.Lloyd is now a middle aged failure who has been stuck in a menial job for the last twenty years, a weary, disillusioned man who is pathetically in love with his co-worker, an impossibly beautiful ingenue (There's always an impossibly beautiful ingenue in a Sturges film ). And then he gets fired. . .Neddless to say, all will end well, and he will triumph and get the girl in the end.But not before going  berserk on ""The Diddlebock"" which transforms him from a meek innocent into a lunatic gambler and high roller with a taste for um... somewhat loud attire.Poor Harold wakes up sober two days later to find himself the owner of a circus, replete with strongmen and bearded ladies who are owed back pay and hungry lions that need to be fed.It's all silly fluff of course but the genius of Preston Sturges's writing makes us cheerfully suspend our disbelief and go along for the ride.Only Lubitsch and Billy Wilder came close to Sturges in the ability to give the audience superbly witty dialogue while maintaining a believable world of madcap lunacy where events move at breakneck speed.An great farce, starring a comic legend, written and and directed by the best.Enjoy.",5,You Arouse the Artist in Me.,1032998400,"09 26, 2002",2002,2346,"['how', 'bartender', 'Harold', 'Diddlebock', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'when', 'told', 'have', 'first', 'drink', 'life.Harold', 'talked', ""'Wormy"", 'deliciously', 'street-wise', 'octagenerian', 'urchin', 'loan', 'couple', 'bucks', 'Harold', 'complies', 'fact', 'just', 'been', 'fired', 'job.The', 'inspired', 'bartender', 'concurs', 'Wormy', 'Harold', 'drink', 'ease', 'troubles', '-in', 'scene', 'only', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'Diddlebock', 'honor.Originally', 'entitled', ""'The"", 'Sin', 'Harold', 'Diddlebock', 'real', 'sin', 'being', 'unable', 'rent', 'most', 'video', 'stores', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'top', 'comedies', 'ever', 'made.Lloyd', 'came', 'retirement', 'make', 'film', 'meeting', 'befriending', 'kindred', 'maniac', 'Preston', 'Sturges.In', 'Mad', 'Wednesday', 'Lloyd', 'funniest', 'sight', 'gags', 'ever', 'captured', 'celluloid', 'employing', 'trademark', 'high-risk', 'stunts', 'Ever', 'see', ""'Safety"", 'Last', 'Houdini', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud.In', 'movies', 'Lloyd', 'played', 'hopelessly', 'naive', 'gung-ho', 'optimist', 'who', 'triumphed', 'world', 'childlike', 'sweetness.But', 'here', 'formula', 'twist', 'thanks', 'Sturges.Lloyd', 'now', 'middle', 'aged', 'failure', 'who', 'been', 'stuck', 'menial', 'job', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'weary', 'disillusioned', 'man', 'who', 'pathetically', 'love', 'co-worker', 'impossibly', 'beautiful', 'ingenue', 'always', 'impossibly', 'beautiful', 'ingenue', 'Sturges', 'film', 'then', 'fired', '.Neddless', 'say', 'will', 'end', 'well', 'will', 'triumph', 'get', 'girl', 'end.But', 'not', 'going', 'berserk', 'Diddlebock', 'meek', 'innocent', 'lunatic', 'gambler', 'high', 'roller', 'taste', 'um', 'somewhat', 'loud', 'attire.Poor', 'Harold', 'up', 'sober', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'find', 'owner', 'circus', 'replete', 'strongmen', 'bearded', 'ladies', 'who', 'are', 'owed', 'back', 'pay', 'hungry', 'lions', 'need', 'be', 'fed.It', 'silly', 'fluff', 'course', 'genius', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'writing', 'cheerfully', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'go', 'along', 'ride.Only', 'Lubitsch', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'came', 'close', 'Sturges', 'ability', 'give', 'audience', 'superbly', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'maintaining', 'believable', 'world', 'madcap', 'lunacy', 'where', 'events', 'move', 'breakneck', 'speed.An', 'great', 'farce', 'starring', 'comic', 'legend', 'written', 'directed', 'best.Enjoy']",Mad Wednesday VHS
