However I found Dangerous Beauty to be an exception. It's based loosely on the life of Veronica Franco, a courtesan in 16th century Venice.The story starts out with an almost Romeo and Juliet like setting, two young people in love, but their families don't afford them the luxury of marrying one another. Veronica's love interest is the brother of her best friend, a wealthy man who's family has planned for him marry for national alliances. Being that she's not up to par social in class standards for her would be in-laws, her mother offers to her an option on how she can still be with the man she loves, though not through marriage. The only way it would be socially acceptable for her to still see him, even after marriage, is if she was a well respected courtesan. She rejects the idea vehemently at first, but after her mother shows her what few other options she has in life, she accepts it, then embraces it.Her looks, quick wit, poetry and desire for knowledge allow her to raise through the ranks quickly and be quite sought after. She becomes very good at what she does, and wins the hearts of many rich and powerful men in Venice. By the time she is finally able to again be with her true love, wars, kings, the Black Plague and the Spanish Inquisition all now stand in their way.

Other women chose the profession because they felt it offered them a better life and more freedom than they'd find in a marital arrangement.

104845,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,0790736365,Charismatic Creature,"[36, 76]","Bodice-ripping period flick based (very very loosely) on real-life 16th century Venetian courtesan, Veronica Franco. I have managed to catch this movie twice -- not on purpose -- and I did stick through to the end, so there is something of the ""guilty pleasure"" here of heaving bosoms, fancy costumes, jewel-encrusted goblets, etc.But this is the low-brow equivalent of a supermarket romance novel. IMDB lists no fewer than FIVE different titles for this film, 3 in the US alone and I don't recall it ever appearing at my local cineplex. It's really just soft-focus, soft-core porn for women (no horny guy could bear to sit thought this slop for the minimal nudity). That in itself wouldn't be so terrible, but I really mind historical fiction that butchers history.There are so many gaffes, it would take a ream of paper to list them all. Veronica is the kind of prostitute imagined by junior high school girls -- she's gorgeous, gets to wear incredible gowns and has loving, consensual, pleasurable sex with numerous good looking, stud-like men who respect her deeply. No old fat guys, impotent jerks, no one beats her up or refuses to pay her. Oh, and somehow someone has invented a sixteenth century ""morning after"" drug with NO side effects, so she can have all the sex she wants and never get pregnant.When in love with frog-eyed Rufus Sewell (as stiff as a Ken doll), Veronica dons men's clothing and rides horseback in pants. Other times, she wears short, revealing skirts or skirts over slacks. (Trust me, no woman in the Renaissance could have EVER dressed this way.) Catherine McCormack is beautiful, but has a very limited emotional range. She is especially unconvincing as a young teenager, since she's probably in her late twenties. (The fine Australian actress, Naomi Watts has a small part as Sewell's wife in an arranged marriage and is totally wasted in an unsympathetic part...you have to wonder what she could have done in the title role.)The whole thing culminates in an embarrassing ""trial"", where all the important men of the city stand up to the Grand Inquisition and admit they are Veronica's ""customers"" (risking punishment themselves, not to mention the wrath of their wives). This is just grating and unrealistic in the extreme. The real Veronica Franco was tried twice by the Inquisition (in private, as it was normally done) and not for witchcraft, which is absurd.Even worse is the poetry...clearly this is NOT Veronica's actual poetry, even in translation, but some kind of awful doggerel produced for the film. In all my readings about the Italian Renaissance, I never read anything about ""poetry slam"" contests, and if they had them, the quality of the poetry would have been considerably better -- remember this is roughly the period that William Shakespeare was working in.The film ends abruptly after the trail, with just a brief afterword on the screen to ensure us that Marco (Sewell) and Veronica remained in love for the rest of their lives. Uh-huh.The real lives of prostitutes, even courtesans, are totally ignored -- no unwanted pregnancies, illegitimate children (in a time when that made one a social outcast), venereal diseases, etc. Only one brief mention of the inevitable end of a prostitutes life -- a diseased outcast on the fringes of society, tossed out with no protection when she is no longer pretty or young.Although this movie is not especially ""dirty"" -- I have seen and heard much worse on ""Sex in the City"" -- I shudder to think of impressionable young girls seeing it and thinking that this is a historically accurate representation of women's lives in the past. There is NOTHING romantic about being a prostitute.In short -- bad, hammy soft-core nonsense for addle-brained romantics who have never studied history or want anything serious to think about.",1,Renaissance Venice: 90210,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,3817,"['Bodice-ripping', 'period', 'flick', 'based', 'very', 'very', 'loosely', 'real-life', '16th', 'century', 'Venetian', 'courtesan', 'Veronica', 'Franco', 'have', 'managed', 'catch', 'movie', 'twice', 'not', 'purpose', 'did', 'stick', 'end', 'something', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'here', 'heaving', 'bosoms', 'fancy', 'costumes', 'jewel-encrusted', 'goblets', 'etc.But', 'low-brow', 'equivalent', 'supermarket', 'romance', 'novel', 'IMDB', 'fewer', 'FIVE', 'different', 'titles', 'film', '3', 'US', 'alone', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'appearing', 'local', 'cineplex', 'really', 'just', 'soft-focus', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'women', 'horny', 'guy', 'could', 'bear', 'sit', 'thought', 'slop', 'minimal', 'nudity', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'terrible', 'really', 'mind', 'historical', 'fiction', 'butchers', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'gaffes', 'would', 'take', 'ream', 'paper', 'list', 'Veronica', 'kind', 'prostitute', 'imagined', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'gorgeous', 'wear', 'incredible', 'gowns', 'loving', 'consensual', 'pleasurable', 'sex', 'numerous', 'good', 'looking', 'stud-like', 'men', 'who', 'respect', 'deeply', 'old', 'fat', 'guys', 'impotent', 'jerks', 'one', 'up', 'refuses', 'pay', 'Oh', 'somehow', 'someone', 'invented', 'sixteenth', 'century', 'morning', 'drug', 'NO', 'side', 'effects', 'can', 'have', 'sex', 'never', 'get', 'pregnant.When', 'love', 'frog-eyed', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'as', 'stiff', 'Ken', 'doll', 'Veronica', 'men', 'clothing', 'rides', 'horseback', 'pants', 'Other', 'times', 'short', 'revealing', 'skirts', 'skirts', 'slacks', 'Trust', 'woman', 'Renaissance', 'could', 'have', 'EVER', 'dressed', 'way', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'beautiful', 'very', 'limited', 'emotional', 'range', 'especially', 'unconvincing', 'young', 'teenager', 'probably', 'late', 'twenties', 'fine', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'small', 'part', 'Sewell', 'wife', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'totally', 'wasted', 'unsympathetic', 'part', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'title', 'role', 'whole', 'thing', 'culminates', 'embarrassing', 'trial', 'where', 'important', 'men', 'city', 'stand', 'up', 'Grand', 'Inquisition', 'admit', 'are', 'Veronica', 'customers', 'risking', 'punishment', 'not', 'mention', 'wrath', 'wives', 'just', 'grating', 'unrealistic', 'extreme', 'real', 'Veronica', 'Franco', 'was', 'tried', 'twice', 'Inquisition', 'private', 'was', 'normally', 'done', 'not', 'witchcraft', 'absurd.Even', 'worse', 'poetry', 'clearly', 'NOT', 'Veronica', 'actual', 'poetry', 'even', 'translation', 'kind', 'awful', 'doggerel', 'produced', 'film', 'readings', 'Italian', 'Renaissance', 'never', 'read', 'anything', 'poetry', 'slam', 'contests', 'had', 'quality', 'poetry', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considerably', 'better', 'remember', 'roughly', 'period', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'working', 'in.The', 'film', 'abruptly', 'trail', 'just', 'brief', 'afterword', 'screen', 'ensure', 'Marco', 'Sewell', 'Veronica', 'remained', 'love', 'rest', 'lives', 'Uh-huh.The', 'real', 'lives', 'prostitutes', 'even', 'courtesans', 'are', 'totally', 'ignored', 'unwanted', 'pregnancies', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'time', 'when', 'made', 'one', 'social', 'outcast', 'venereal', 'diseases', 'etc', 'Only', 'one', 'brief', 'mention', 'inevitable', 'end', 'prostitutes', 'life', 'diseased', 'outcast', 'fringes', 'society', 'tossed', 'out', 'protection', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'pretty', 'movie', 'not', 'especially', 'dirty', 'have', 'seen', 'heard', 'much', 'worse', 'Sex', 'City', 'shudder', 'think', 'impressionable', 'young', 'girls', 'seeing', 'thinking', 'historically', 'accurate', 'representation', 'women', 'lives', 'past', 'NOTHING', 'romantic', 'being', 'prostitute.In', 'short', 'bad', 'hammy', 'soft-core', 'nonsense', 'addle-brained', 'romantics', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'studied', 'history', 'want', 'anything', 'serious', 'think']",N/A

Miller ""Knitter and bookworm""","[13, 14]","This highly evocative and entertaining film was sadly ignored when it was released in 1998, but it is most definitely worth a second look.  The film explores the world of courtesans, women in Renaissance-era Venice who lived to pleasure men but were also allowed access to education at a time when most women couldn't even read.Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack of &quot;Braveheart&quot; fame) has no dowry to marry her true love Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) and thus learns the art of giving pleasure from her mother (Jacqueline Bisset).  She quickly becomes the most sought-after courtesan in Venice, earns renown as a poet in her own right, and finds herself afforded a small deal more power than most women in Venice.The cast is first-rate.  McCormack imbues Veronica with a great deal of intelligence and passion, as well as a searing wit.  She may come across as far too post-modern in a few scenes, though those are likely meant to portray her as ahead of her time.  Rufus Sewell may not have the looks of the typical romantic lead, but he is probably the most convincing one in recent years.  The male characters may be intriguing, but far more fascinating are the women, who display the limited options available to Renaissance women. As Beatrice, Marco's sister, Moira Kelly marries a man older than her father, and condemns herself life of motherhood and lack of fulfillment.  The regret registers on her face more and more with each scene in a very affecting performance.  Naomi Watts makes a brief appearance as Marco's pious wife, who cannot be anything more than what she was taught.Things begin to fall apart, literally and artistically, when the Plague and the Inquisition roll into town, and the grandstanding finale may strike some as over the top, but on the whole, &quot;Dangerous Beauty&quot; is a provocative, interesting, lovely film.",4,An underrated gem,1068768000,"11 14, 2003",2003,1860,"['highly', 'evocative', 'entertaining', 'film', 'was', 'sadly', 'ignored', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1998', 'most', 'definitely', 'second', 'look', 'film', 'world', 'courtesans', 'women', 'Renaissance-era', 'Venice', 'who', 'lived', 'pleasure', 'men', 'were', 'also', 'allowed', 'access', 'education', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'women', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'read.Veronica', 'Franco', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'quot', 'Braveheart', 'quot', 'fame', 'dowry', 'marry', 'true', 'love', 'Marco', 'Venier', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'thus', 'art', 'giving', 'pleasure', 'mother', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'quickly', 'most', 'sought-after', 'courtesan', 'Venice', 'renown', 'poet', 'own', 'right', 'afforded', 'small', 'deal', 'more', 'power', 'most', 'women', 'Venice.The', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'McCormack', 'Veronica', 'great', 'deal', 'intelligence', 'passion', 'as', 'well', 'searing', 'wit', 'may', 'come', 'far', 'too', 'post-modern', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'likely', 'meant', 'portray', 'ahead', 'time', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'looks', 'typical', 'romantic', 'lead', 'probably', 'most', 'convincing', 'one', 'recent', 'years', 'male', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'intriguing', 'far', 'more', 'fascinating', 'are', 'women', 'who', 'display', 'limited', 'options', 'available', 'Renaissance', 'women', 'Beatrice', 'Marco', 'sister', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'man', 'older', 'father', 'condemns', 'life', 'motherhood', 'lack', 'fulfillment', 'regret', 'registers', 'face', 'more', 'more', 'scene', 'very', 'affecting', 'performance', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Marco', 'pious', 'wife', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'taught.Things', 'begin', 'fall', 'apart', 'literally', 'artistically', 'when', 'Plague', 'Inquisition', 'roll', 'town', 'grandstanding', 'finale', 'may', 'strike', 'top', 'whole', 'quot', 'Dangerous', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'provocative', 'interesting', 'lovely', 'film']",N/A

104859,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0790736365,Dennis Littrell,"[17, 32]","Yes, and Santa Claus is coming to town.Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack), a woman with a venerable family name but no cash, learns the  oldest profession from her mother after experiencing the considerable shock  of seeing a young woman in the nunnery (her first choice since she can't  marry the man she loves) getting her golden locks shorn.  No danger of that  for Veronica, whose mane flows free even when she might dress down a little  to hide from the hoi polloi, who are blaming her sinful ways for the plague  that visits 16th Century Venice.Rufus Sewell plays nobleman Marco Venier  who loves her but must marry someone else for the good of the family  fortune.  He plays the role like a caddy to McCormack, which is the way men  appear in romance novels.  McCormack herself gives only a workman-like  performance that cannot lift this historical romance above the usual  paperback issue.  (We really needed Kate Winslet, but perhaps she read the  script.)  The rather routine indictment of the Inquisition and soft  revelations of  the hypocrisy of the Venetian nobility can't disguise the  fact that this is a women's fantasy-fulfillment indulgence all the way and  nothing more.  The movie is also politically correct in the tiresome manner  of the 1990's, when women must be shown as triumphing over men through the  sheer power of their cleverness and superior moxie.Once again Hollywood  celebrates the high class whore as being ahead of her time.  We see her  gain admiration and riches as she develops a worldly sophistication second  perhaps only to that of the Pope.  Yet there is some truth to this stale  notion.  To make it work though, we needed to see Veronica's seamy side, to  experience the crudity of her lascivious and exploitive nature.  Instead we  have a fairy tale princess whore, Snow White turning tricks in gorgeous  gowns sans syphilis, sans beatings, sans pimp.Jacqueline Bisset is  competent as the mother who teaches her daughter how to exploit men.  As a  pep talk she tells Veronica that courtesans are the best educated women,  and you are following in the footsteps of Cleopatra.  I think the  historical fact (if fact it is) that the only women who were allowed to  read in 16th century Venice were courtesans, confused the designers of this  tale into thinking that courtesans were the superior ladies of Venetian  society.  They were the only women allowed in the library because they were  considered already corrupted.  The whole movie suffers from this sort of  ""gee whiz this is so eye-opening for our times"" treatment.  The climactic  scene before the Inquisition in particular is embarrassing in the  melodramatic naivet&eacute; of its phony development.  Hollywood is again  attempting to re-write history in light of the current PC agenda.

It takes place in 16th century Venice, and the sets / wardrobe are magnificent.  It is also based on a true story.  The film is taken from a biography that originated as a doctoral dissertation at Yale university.The movie centers on a bleak time in human history when women had precious few economical avenues in which to earn a living.  Being a harlot was about the only profitable occupation, but it came at a severe price.One of the central themes of the film is how well educated upper-tier courtesans were.  Some viewers of this movie may be inclined to think that the filmmakers made this up.  They did no such thing!  A legacy that traces back to the ancient Greeks mandated that high-priced prostitutes be articulate, intelligent and able to carry on conversations about sundry topics.  Even today, ""High Society"" Escort services encourage the women who work there to have dynamic personalities and not be ""one dimensional.""The engine that makes this movie go is Catherine McCormack.  I did not know who she was before seeing this DVD, but this morning I added several of her other movies to my Amazon wish-list.  She is stunning, exquisite AND she's a great actress.  She has a natural screen presence and has all the subtle nuances down of being a good actress.  While the story was very interesting, the movie would have been ruined had they picked an attractive but mediocre actress  to play the lead.  Oh, and the fact that McCormack is willing to shed her clothes gives her an A+ in my book!The plot serves as a sobering statement of how the Christians were heckling people 500+ years ago just like they do today.  What's worse is that they had the legal authority to condemn people they didn't like.  This story is a grim reminder of why the Founding Fathers of the United States were so vehement about separation of Church & State.If you like Period movies, pick up this DVD.  If you're Italian, pick up this DVD.  If you're not Italian, pick up this movie.  Did I leave anyone out?

The tender, sweet minstrelsy of the score composed by George Fenton opens the movie to the bold and brilliant reds and crimsons of the costumes and  drapery.  Half romance, half women's studies, this film emphasizes the  power and danger of a woman's beauty, refinement, and intellect.  Catherine  McCormack is wonderful as Veronica Franco, an irrepressible young woman who  is fascinated by the courtesans she sees gliding by in gondolas and  flaunting their beauty in 16th century Venice.  At the edge of the canals,  the men of Venice are at their mercy, pleading and promising and tossing  roses.  Little does Veronica know that such a life awaits her.  Absorbed in  her books and poetry, she can only be distracted by the charms of Marco  Venier (curly haired, luminous-eyed Rufus Sewell).  Nonetheless, their love  is not enough to overcome his family duty to marry well and according to  his station.  By a somewhat surprising teacher (Jacqueline Bisset),  Veronica is tutored in the principles of seduction in the most amusing  sequence of the film.  &quot;You must know pleasure in order to give  pleasure.&quot;  She herself is seduced into the world of courtesans by  their unlimited access to political and cultural information not suitable  for &quot;ladies of quality&quot;.  Only as a courtesan can she have  knowledge, artistic freedom...and MarcoThere are several lively scenes,  especially with Marco's cousin, played by Oliver Platt.  Veronica and he  match wits and combine word play and sword play, as Veronica proves that  she can participate in men's games and even occasionally best them.  Although this film glorifies the prostitute, the difference is made  painfully clear between the pitifully, ignorant &quot;wives of Venice&quot;  and the enlightened courtesan in the dramatic scene in which Veronica  answers a summons from her old friend (Moira Kelly).  Is it better to be a  virtuous yet sublimated wife or an enlightened yet exploited courtesan?  The film argues for the latter, as women are humiliated in either role, as  wife or courtesan.  Is it not then better to take advantage of the basic  freedoms of thought, speech and creative expression not encouraged for  &quot;ordinary&quot; women?  This deeper question lurks in the lavish  background of ermine, peacock feathers and pearls, and is only partially  resolved for one woman, Veronica Franco.",4,"&quot;Venice, proud and pretty...&quot;",963446400,"07 13, 2000",2000,2454,"['Almost', 'everything', 'film', 'quot', 'proud', 'pretty', 'quot', 'tender', 'sweet', 'minstrelsy', 'score', 'composed', 'George', 'Fenton', 'movie', 'bold', 'brilliant', 'reds', 'crimsons', 'costumes', 'drapery', 'Half', 'romance', 'half', 'women', 'studies', 'film', 'power', 'danger', 'woman', 'beauty', 'refinement', 'intellect', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'wonderful', 'Veronica', 'Franco', 'irrepressible', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'fascinated', 'courtesans', 'gliding', 'gondolas', 'flaunting', 'beauty', '16th', 'century', 'Venice', 'edge', 'canals', 'men', 'Venice', 'are', 'mercy', 'pleading', 'promising', 'tossing', 'roses', 'Little', 'Veronica', 'know', 'life', 'Absorbed', 'books', 'poetry', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'distracted', 'charms', 'Marco', 'Venier', 'curly', 'haired', 'luminous-eyed', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Nonetheless', 'love', 'not', 'enough', 'overcome', 'family', 'duty', 'marry', 'well', 'according', 'station', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'teacher', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'Veronica', 'tutored', 'principles', 'seduction', 'most', 'amusing', 'sequence', 'film', 'quot', 'must', 'know', 'pleasure', 'order', 'give', 'pleasure.', 'quot', 'seduced', 'world', 'courtesans', 'unlimited', 'access', 'political', 'cultural', 'information', 'not', 'suitable', 'quot', 'ladies', 'quality', 'quot', 'Only', 'courtesan', 'can', 'have', 'knowledge', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'MarcoThere', 'are', 'several', 'lively', 'scenes', 'especially', 'Marco', 'cousin', 'played', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Veronica', 'match', 'wits', 'combine', 'word', 'play', 'sword', 'play', 'Veronica', 'can', 'participate', 'men', 'games', 'even', 'occasionally', 'best', 'film', 'prostitute', 'difference', 'made', 'painfully', 'clear', 'pitifully', 'ignorant', 'quot', 'wives', 'Venice', 'quot', 'enlightened', 'courtesan', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'Veronica', 'summons', 'old', 'friend', 'Moira', 'Kelly', 'better', 'be', 'virtuous', 'yet', 'sublimated', 'wife', 'enlightened', 'yet', 'exploited', 'courtesan', 'film', 'latter', 'women', 'are', 'humiliated', 'role', 'wife', 'courtesan', 'not', 'then', 'better', 'take', 'advantage', 'basic', 'freedoms', 'thought', 'speech', 'creative', 'expression', 'not', 'encouraged', 'quot', 'ordinary', 'quot', 'women', 'deeper', 'question', 'lurks', 'lavish', 'background', 'ermine', 'peacock', 'feathers', 'pearls', 'only', 'partially', 'resolved', 'one', 'woman', 'Veronica', 'Franco']",N/A

There was the cliche scene where Katherine McCormack's brother yanks the poetry she's writing for Rufus Sewell, waves it above her head, and she tries to get it back. There were other, acceptably cliche scenes, I suppose.Then, thankfully, she becomes a courtesan. Pretty good montages, everything's shot pretty well. And, of course, the T&amp;A didn't hurt. Everything's going good. She gets railed by a lot of dudes.Then the inquisition comes. And it starts to get pretty bad. I started to just not pay attention. I even laughed out loud at a few parts.But that was nothing like the laugh that burst out of me when Oliver FATT turned around in the courtroom and turned out to be the one who would condemn her. I mean come on. That was such a terrible cliched movie trick. I lost all respect for the movie after that. Oh yeah, and of COURSE Katherine McCormack can't just admit to being a witch and then run off with Rufus Sewell and screw happily for the rest of their lives. No, she has to take a &quot;stand&quot; against this evil. Even though, really, there was no preamble to her being so all of a sudden ideological. Freak'n conventions of movies.

Romantic audience won't be disappointed. However, if you're the *other* type of viewer probably in the minority who is looking for an accurate portrayal of one of Venice's most famous courtesans and female poets Veronica Franco then you *might* be disappointed.The Real Veronica was undoubtedly a very educated woman who was way before her time. In times where women were looked down upon. She was more than just a courtesan which is something I'm glad this movie portrays accurately. Her mother has also been known to be a former courtesan which is probably where Veronica took her profession . In this movie it is suggested that Veronica chose her lifestyle because she was in love with Marco Venier whom she couldn't marry due to rank differences. The real reason is probably because she wanted to support herself financially.  Although Marco Venier is a *real* character and has been at least a friend if not more to the real Veronica there isn't much known about their relationship or its final destiny.In a matter of fact Veronica was married to a wealthy physician before becoming a courtesan early in her years but the marriage was a fail and ended shortly. She also had six children three who have died in infancy. She had a *short* lived affair with the King of France. During the plague in Venice she was forced to leave the city and all her possessions and wealth behind her then when she returned was charged with witchcraft but because of the help of powerful men in Venice namely *Marco Venier* and others the charges were dropped.Her eventual fate is uncertain but it's believed she died as a poor prostitute.On the contrary I'm glad someone chose to do a movie about this interesting woman. The movie does stick to some facts although of course the majority is fictional which in this case inevitable or else how will they do a movie based on so little ?As long as you don't care for the actual/real story. The inaccuracies shouldn't bother you. In a matter of fact I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of romance. It may not be a Historical account but it's an Excellent Romance Film that will leave you entertained for the most part.PS-I didn't enjoy the beginning of this movie (Couldn't understand for the life of me why Veronica would be a courtesan just to attract Marco's attentions when she could be his lover) but the movie did really pick up mid way when the Hero/Heroine finally came in terms together.

104886,A2HI7DLWKY4QFK,0790736365,"Jill Myles ""Jill Myles""","[20, 22]","Let me just start out by saying that this movie has been one of my personal favorites since it tanked in movie theaters several years back.  I didn't expect much, due to the fact that historical dramas typically don't do well.  'Dangerous Beauty' is the 'true' story of Veronica Franco, a Venetian courtesan of the 16th century.  Now, Veronica Franco was a real person, but I suspect that a few historical facts were glossed over to make this movie a tad more interesting -- I don't mind, gloss away!As a lover of historical films, I have to say that the thing that impressed me the most about this movie was the setting. The costumes, the sets, hairstyles, etc....everything is beautifully opulent and perfect to the period it is set in.  No cheap budget here -- you truly get the feel of the Italian Renaissance.The story line is most fascinating when Veronica's mother is teaching her about being a courtesan, and slows a bit towards the end of the movie, but ends on a happy note.  I found Catherine McCormack (Veronica) and Rufus Sewell (Marco) a bit stiff in their roles in certain scenes, and charming in others, so it's hard to judge, but the movie moves along swimmingly well, the best being the small part that the indomitable Moira Kelly has playing Veronica's ill-fated-in-marriage best friend.The movie itself receives 4 out of 5 stars from me.  The DVD picture quality is good, and the sound quality is good, but as usual with 'less popular' movies, the DVD Extras are simply lacking.

I was totally captivated and smitten by Catherine McCormack's portrayal of Veronica Franco a real life Courtesan of the 16th century.  It was an exquisite film from beginning to end.  Jacqueline Biset was superb as Veronica's mother who taught her daughter the powerful arts of her sex and set her upon a path that would eventually lead her into the arms of Senators, Kings and Priests.  The understated Rufus Sewell was excellent as the love of her life who at first abandons her when she has to bed the King of France for the sake of her country, but who finally rallies to her side when a jealous young priest accuses her of witchcraft.  There are many memorable moments in this film, one being Veronica trying to dissuade her friend from having her daughter become a Courtesan.  It is poignant and heartfelt as two women look at the lives they live and wish they were the other.  Add to this the scene where Veronica confesses not to being witch before the Catholic Inquisition but just a woman whose choice of profession has been dictated to her by the narrow constraints of Venetian society.  This is a film for those who want to be stimulated both sensually and intellectually.  It's a shame that it didn't reach a wider audience when it first came out in 1998.

104894,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0790736365,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 19]","We are told at the start of &quot;Dangerous Beauty&quot; that this is based on a true story, and indeed Veronica Franco was a well-born Venetian beauty during the Renaissance who decided to become a courtesan.  The argument is that for an intelligent woman this was a better choice than being forced into an arranged marriage with some old rich guy or to end up poor.  This is especially true when Veronica (Catherine McCormack) is told by the man she loves, Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell), that they cannot marry because they are in different classes of Venetian society.  So when Veronica's mother, Paola Franco (Jacqueline Bisset) reveals that she had once been a successful courtesan, the daughter is persuaded to follow suit, especially once her mother tells her that a courtesan can go one place that is off limits to other women: the great library of Venice.I had two major concerns in watching this movie.  The first was the idea that this was a true story, because I had the feeling at some point my credulity on this score was going to be tested.  This indeed turned out to be the case, because at the climax of this film Veronica ends up being called before the Inquisition and being one of the most public prostitutes in Venice actually turns out to be an advantage.  Veronica might not be a saint like Joan d'Arc, but apparently some sins are much better than others in Venice in those days.  The second was that Rufus Sewell was in the film, and having seen him in &quot;A Knight's Tale&quot; and the &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; mini-series, I was predisposed to think of him as a bad person.  Yes, this 1998 movie was made before either or those productions, but such was my thinking and it took me a while to understand that his character was actually a good person, albeit one constrained by the strictures of his society and class.Just as I was surprised by who was to be the &quot;hero&quot; in this film, relatively speaking, I was equally surprised by the villain turning out to be Oliver Platt, who plays the studious Maffio Venier.  Veronica makes her public reputation as a courtesan due in large part to a verbal duel she has with Maffio, but when she refuses his attention because she values his friendship, the duel become a more literal one.  Maffio then goes in the completely opposite direction and comes up with a logical, but unexpected way of bringing her to task for her refusal.  This sets up the big finish, where Veronica learns that she apparently she is tolerated more than respected, despite the service she has done to her city-state.This is only the second film that Marshall Herkovitz has directed, the first being 1993's &quot;Jack the Bear,&quot; although most would be familiar from his work on television's &quot;thirtysomething,&quot; &quot;My So Called Life,&quot; and &quot;Once and Again.&quot;  I did not know if I realized how often Herkovitz's constant partner Edward Zwick was doing the work behind the camera.  Of course in any sort of costume drama the key is to have a good cinematographer (Bojan Bazelli), art direction (Stefania Cella and Gianni Giovagnoni), set direction (Ian Whittaker), and costumes (Gabriella Pescucci), and Herkovitz has all of those in his favor.  However, in the end I am curious as to whether the ending was originally in Margaret Rosenthal's book or created by Jeannie Dominy's script, because if I had not been told upfront that this was essentially a &quot;true&quot; story, I would have been judging the big finish quite differently and probably not as harshly.",4,"If you are going to be a courtesan, be the best you can be",1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,3545,"['are', 'told', 'start', 'quot', 'Dangerous', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'indeed', 'Veronica', 'Franco', 'was', 'well-born', 'Venetian', 'beauty', 'Renaissance', 'who', 'decided', 'become', 'courtesan', 'argument', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'was', 'better', 'choice', 'being', 'forced', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'old', 'rich', 'guy', 'end', 'up', 'poor', 'especially', 'true', 'when', 'Veronica', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'told', 'man', 'Marco', 'Venier', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'can', 'not', 'marry', 'are', 'different', 'classes', 'Venetian', 'society', 'So', 'when', 'Veronica', 'mother', 'Paola', 'Franco', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'successful', 'courtesan', 'daughter', 'persuaded', 'follow', 'suit', 'especially', 'once', 'mother', 'courtesan', 'can', 'go', 'one', 'place', 'limits', 'other', 'women', 'great', 'library', 'Venice.I', 'had', 'two', 'major', 'concerns', 'watching', 'movie', 'first', 'was', 'idea', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'had', 'feeling', 'point', 'credulity', 'score', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'tested', 'indeed', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'case', 'climax', 'film', 'Veronica', 'up', 'being', 'called', 'Inquisition', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'public', 'prostitutes', 'Venice', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'advantage', 'Veronica', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'saint', 'Joan', ""d'Arc"", 'apparently', 'sins', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'others', 'Venice', 'days', 'second', 'was', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'was', 'film', 'having', 'seen', 'quot', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'quot', 'quot', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'quot', 'mini-series', 'was', 'predisposed', 'think', 'bad', 'person', 'Yes', '1998', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'productions', 'such', 'was', 'thinking', 'took', 'while', 'understand', 'character', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'person', 'one', 'constrained', 'strictures', 'society', 'class.Just', 'was', 'surprised', 'who', 'was', 'be', 'quot', 'hero', 'quot', 'film', 'relatively', 'speaking', 'was', 'equally', 'surprised', 'villain', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'who', 'studious', 'Maffio', 'Venier', 'Veronica', 'public', 'reputation', 'courtesan', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'verbal', 'duel', 'Maffio', 'when', 'attention', 'friendship', 'duel', 'become', 'more', 'literal', 'one', 'Maffio', 'then', 'completely', 'opposite', 'direction', 'up', 'logical', 'unexpected', 'way', 'bringing', 'task', 'refusal', 'up', 'big', 'finish', 'where', 'Veronica', 'apparently', 'tolerated', 'more', 'respected', 'service', 'done', 'city-state.This', 'only', 'second', 'film', 'Marshall', 'Herkovitz', 'directed', 'first', 'being', '1993', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Bear', 'quot', 'most', 'would', 'be', 'familiar', 'work', 'television', 'quot', 'thirtysomething', 'quot', 'quot', 'My', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'quot', 'quot', 'Once', 'Again.', 'quot', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'realized', 'how', 'often', 'Herkovitz', 'constant', 'partner', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'was', 'doing', 'work', 'camera', 'course', 'sort', 'costume', 'drama', 'key', 'have', 'good', 'cinematographer', 'Bojan', 'Bazelli', 'art', 'direction', 'Stefania', 'Cella', 'Gianni', 'Giovagnoni', 'set', 'direction', 'Ian', 'Whittaker', 'costumes', 'Gabriella', 'Pescucci', 'Herkovitz', 'favor', 'However', 'end', 'am', 'curious', 'ending', 'was', 'originally', 'Margaret', 'Rosenthal', 'book', 'created', 'Jeannie', 'Dominy', 'script', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'told', 'upfront', 'was', 'essentially', 'quot', 'true', 'quot', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'judging', 'big', 'finish', 'quite', 'differently', 'probably', 'not', 'harshly']",N/A

Unfortunately though, Ms. McCormack can't act although she does look pretty in some gorgeous costumes.

It's about politics, first and foremost.  It seems that everyone in Venice is a politician - from senator to cardinal.  Veronica Franco, played by Catherine McCormack, becomes a politician too.  She's much more than a sought-after courtesan.  Through sexual favors, she gains access to the world of men.  In a way, she becomes ""one of the boys"".

104904,A152C8GYY25HAH,0790736365,Matthew Horner,"[11, 16]","""Dangerous Beauty"" is certainly lovely to look at. It was filmed in Rome and in Venice, two of the most photogenic cities on earth.It's a period piece. This type of film usually has a tough time at the boxoffice. There are exceptions of course. There's that indestructible movie about a beautiful, self centered woman who got through The Civil War and everything else anyway she could. Recently, there was a megahit that was sort of a retread of Romeo and Juliet, which took place on a ship that didn't make it to port.I don't know enough about 16th Century Italy to say if ""Dangerous Beauty"" is remotely accurate. I do know it tells a very interesting tale about a young woman who is not rich enough to marry her beloved. So she becomes a courtesan, which is what we would call a high class call girl today. As Veronica, the courtesan, the up and coming star Catherine McCormack gives a very credible performance. As he lover, who is forced to marry someone of his own station, Rufus Sewell is also very good.Something tells me the story is not that far fetched. Arranged marriages were common back then. Freewheeling sex has swung back and forth in favor for hundreds of years, at least. Not surprisingly, periods where love was not the basis for a good marriage tended to be ones where liaisons outside the marriage were the most common. verybody knew about them. It just wasn't something people talked about.Director Marshall Herskovitz, who gave us the TV series ""Thirtysomething"" and ""My So Called Life"", shows he is equally adapt on the big screen. In the same breath, considering the humorous - and slightly decadent - tone of those hit shows, you get an idea of why ""Dangerous Beauty"" did so poorly in theaters. In a time where sex on the screen tends to be treated with the utmost seriousness, this film is ribald and light hearted. Some of the most successful films of all times, such as ""Tom Jones"" and ""The Graduate"" treated sex the same way. Luckily for them, they were at the right place at the right time.For adults, I think ""Dangerous Beauty"" will prove to be highly entertaining. Great cinema it is not. But it has lavish sets, good acting and decent dialog It doesn't take either itself or its subject matter seriously.One especially interesting plot device concerns education. According to this film, married Italian ladies of the period were not even expected to know how to read. Courtesans, however, were encouraged to have knowledge, so that they would make interesting companions outside the boudoir. This setup helps to offset their true vocation. In fact, many of the titled wedded women seem quite envious of these rivals for their husbands attentions and affections.",4,"Sexy, well made period drama",1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,2695,"['Dangerous', 'Beauty', 'certainly', 'lovely', 'look', 'was', 'filmed', 'Rome', 'Venice', 'two', 'most', 'photogenic', 'cities', 'earth.It', 'period', 'piece', 'type', 'film', 'usually', 'tough', 'time', 'boxoffice', 'are', 'exceptions', 'course', 'indestructible', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'self', 'centered', 'woman', 'who', 'got', 'Civil', 'War', 'everything', 'else', 'anyway', 'could', 'Recently', 'was', 'megahit', 'was', 'sort', 'retread', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'took', 'place', 'ship', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'port.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', '16th', 'Century', 'Italy', 'say', 'Dangerous', 'Beauty', 'remotely', 'accurate', 'do', 'know', 'very', 'interesting', 'tale', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'rich', 'enough', 'marry', 'beloved', 'courtesan', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'high', 'class', 'call', 'girl', 'today', 'Veronica', 'courtesan', 'up', 'coming', 'star', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'very', 'credible', 'performance', 'who', 'forced', 'marry', 'someone', 'own', 'station', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'also', 'very', 'good.Something', 'tells', 'story', 'not', 'far', 'fetched', 'Arranged', 'marriages', 'were', 'common', 'back', 'then', 'Freewheeling', 'sex', 'swung', 'back', 'forth', 'favor', 'hundreds', 'years', 'least', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'periods', 'where', 'love', 'was', 'not', 'basis', 'good', 'marriage', 'tended', 'be', 'ones', 'where', 'liaisons', 'marriage', 'were', 'most', 'common', 'verybody', 'knew', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'people', 'talked', 'about.Director', 'Marshall', 'Herskovitz', 'who', 'gave', 'TV', 'series', 'Thirtysomething', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'equally', 'adapt', 'big', 'screen', 'same', 'breath', 'considering', 'humorous', 'slightly', 'decadent', 'tone', 'hit', 'shows', 'get', 'idea', 'why', 'Dangerous', 'Beauty', 'did', 'so', 'poorly', 'theaters', 'time', 'where', 'sex', 'screen', 'be', 'treated', 'utmost', 'seriousness', 'film', 'ribald', 'light', 'hearted', 'most', 'successful', 'films', 'times', 'such', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'Graduate', 'treated', 'sex', 'same', 'way', 'Luckily', 'were', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time.For', 'adults', 'think', 'Dangerous', 'Beauty', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'Great', 'cinema', 'not', 'lavish', 'sets', 'good', 'acting', 'decent', 'dialog', ""n't"", 'take', 'subject', 'matter', 'seriously.One', 'especially', 'interesting', 'plot', 'device', 'concerns', 'education', 'According', 'film', 'married', 'Italian', 'ladies', 'period', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'expected', 'know', 'how', 'read', 'Courtesans', 'however', 'were', 'encouraged', 'have', 'knowledge', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'companions', 'boudoir', 'setup', 'offset', 'true', 'vocation', 'fact', 'many', 'titled', 'wedded', 'women', 'seem', 'quite', 'envious', 'rivals', 'husbands', 'attentions', 'affections']",N/A

Regarding accuracy:  the scenery  is wonderful, the costumes realistic (young Veronica wears dresses more  than once!), and accessories identifying one's political position were  accurate.Ms. Bisset is wonderful!  She is absolutely beautiful and  courageous to play the mother of a blossoming woman.  I have also become a  new fan of Ms. McCormick.  I am amazed that a little make-up and changes  in Ms McCormick's facial expressions added years on to her character -  wonderful acting.  Mr. Sewel portrays Marco in such a way that you are  saddened that he is rich and accepts his obligation to such a degree that  he must forfeit his happiness for duty.  He is gorgeous even as a drunk.  (I think he was actually smashed during the filming of the scene.  He is  just too believably drunk.)  McCormick and Sewel have chemistry that is  credible and gives the women viewers a reason smile (I am sure the men  viewers will love it too).  Cousin Mafio, Oliver Platt, is hard to accept  at first because of his other movie roles, however, he does a wonderful job  of playing the ""tag-along"" whimsical cousin.

However, Catherine McCormack takes the story of Veronica Franco, a sixteenth century Venetian courtesan and fills it with intelligence and sensuality.Veronica is a relucant (an exceptionally reluctant) recruit into the profession of courtesan; tutored by her mother (played by the ageless Jacqueline Bisset).  Denied a marriage to her true love, a young aristocrat (Rufus Sewell), by the unfortunate combination of flimsy economic and precarious social standing, she is forced into a calling that allows her to exploit her beauty, wit, brains and... uh... physical prowess into a position of power and weatlth.  She blossoms from innocent girl to sophisticated woman, sought by men for both her body and companionship; despised by women for her independence and influence.  Her standing is eventually threatened by competing forces that hide behind the Church, culminating in a trial before the Inquisition.As always, the afforementioned Ms. Bisset is endlessly capable of making the male heart race.  And the montage of scenes during which she educates the young Vanessa in the ways of a courtesan is unforgettable!  I would go so far as to say that this segment will make you forget the famous dinner sequence from the classic ""Tom Jones"" for its demonstration of lust and sensuality.Oliver Platt also stands out in this cast for his portrayal of an evil opportunist who slithers into a position of Inquisitor, bent on defeating the woman he could never afford.  Other well known names are so immersed in their roles that you might not recognize them, actresses like Naomi Watts, Melina Kankaredes, Moira Kelly and Joanna Cassidy.There are a number of films that merge history with an examination of the sexual politic, but perhaps none do it as well as this one.  It portrays a society that sees itself as genteel and refined, albeit one in which a simple rhyming contest between man and woman can escalate into a bloodletting and exile.

This a lush, historical, romantic movie. It is set in 16th century Venice and is based on the real life cortesan and poet Veronica Franco. The setting of this movie is beautiful ( Could you get any better then historical Venice?) and the costumes are lovely and exotic. Obviously, since this movie is about a courtesan there is bound so be some nudity and sex scenes, but it is all very tastefully done. I also found the characters to be wonderful, and quite realistic. Rufus Sewell, Catherine Mccormick, Moira Kelley are excellent in thier roles.Anyone who would call this movie "" bawdy"" or ""offensive"" has to look at the time and place and it in which it is set. Venice back in the 16th century was as one character puts it in the movie "" A floating brotheral"".There are only a few complaints I have about this movie, which is why I have given it four stars instead of five.

104922,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0790736365,Reviewer,"[3, 4]","There's a consistent moral thread that runs through every society from age to age and generation to generation, the tenets of which are established within parameters, and therefore subject to change; or more specifically, subject to a change in perspective.  And that change can come very quickly-- veritably over night in some instances.  There is also another constant that defines the human condition in any era, and as we find in ""Dangerous Beauty,"" directed by Marshall Herskovitz, it is the fact that an individual will do whatever is necessary to survive.  It is simply an undeniable, irrefutable basic instinct of the human animal.  Moral tenets and survival, however, taken as properties are something akin to oil and water, and will mix accordingly.  Being more often than not polar opposites, conflict is inherent and will ultimately surface at some point or other, the outcome of which is determined by the strength of whichever perspective is prevalent at the moment.  And it is at such moments that we discover that life, like politics, can be a sordid, unpleasant affair; or at the other end of the spectrum, the greatest gift of all.It's 16th Century Venice; Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) is of a wealthy and powerful family, and is a Senator in good standing in the community.  He is also in love with Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack), who though intelligent and beautiful, is beneath Marco's station in society, and they are, therefore, forbidden to marry.  Instead, Marco's father, Pietro (Jeroen Krabbe), has arranged a marriage for his son, an alliance that will be to the substantial benefit of both families.  Veronica's family, meanwhile, due to prevailing circumstances must look to Veronica for support, so her mother, Paola (Jacqueline Bisset), not only arranges for Veronica to become a courtesan, but instructs her herself in the fine art of seduction and the kind of pleasures that will put the most coins in the coffers, as well as how to survive by being in love with ""love.""For Veronica, it soon becomes a lucrative, if not fulfilling enterprise, but there are clouds forming on the horizon, the least of which involves an impending war with the Turks, a war they cannot win without the help of King Henry (Jake Weber) of France.  Very quickly, life in Venice changes; Marco is off to war, and the formerly open acceptance of the courtesans undergoes a swift and drastic reversal of perspective among a seeming majority of those within the city.  And once again Veronica's life is in flux; and she is about to find out that it will never be the same again.Nicely presented and beautifully filmed (the cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is exquisite), Herskovitz's film-- which is based on a true story and adapted from Margaret Rosenthal's novel by screenwriter Jeannine Dominy-- succinctly points up the moral hypocrisy that has always existed within any given culture or society, and which will continue to exist so long as there are social institutions and structures to support them.  And the possible consequences of such diverse perspectives and attitudes, when zealously pursued, are effectively personified in the character of Maffio Venier (Oliver Platt), in whom we find the ultimate manifestation of moral decay, masked by platitudes of self-serving righteousness.  Herskovitz also effectively uses the relationship between Veronica and Maffio-- initially a mutually agreeable rivalry; a contest of words which later turns aggressively ugly-- as a reflection of how readily one facet of society will turn on another if but afforded the appropriate circumstances.  It's a film that works well on a number of levels, as on one hand it's a love story, while on the other it's an insightful dissertation on the inherent imperfections of society, and the fragile moral fiber that holds it together.In the title role, McCormack gives a solid performance; that Veronica is beautiful is obvious, but most importantly, McCormack conveys her intelligence, as well, and it makes her character three-dimensional and quite convincing.  Interestingly enough, Veronica is a sympathetic character for whom, nevertheless, you do not necessarily feel sorry; and perhaps it's because she carries herself so well and has such a strong sense of ""victory"" about her, hiding any vulnerability that would make her susceptible to pity.  This is a woman who takes the detritus life throws at her and makes something of it-- and she does it with dignity.  If her life is morally compromised, it is not due to any acquiescence on her part, but rather the need and the will to survive.  This is a complex character who has to tread a number of fine lines, and McCormack plays it beautifully and believably.As Marco, Sewell hits his stride and turns in an excellent performance, as well.  Marco is something of a pivotal character, in that Veronica's response to him and their relationship becomes the most telling expression of the effects of the courtesan life on her.  And as the story unfolds, Sewell does a nice job of developing his character, finally achieving a depth of emotion that significantly heightens the impact of the climax.In supporting roles, both Platt and Bisset give notable performances, too.  Platt once again demonstrates that he is one of the best character actors in the business; and not only is Bisset exemplary in the role of Paola, but the casting of her and McCormack as mother/daughter was inspired.The supporting cast includes Moira Kelly (Beatrice), Naomi Watts (Guila), Fred Ward (Domenico), Joanna Cassidy (Laura), Peter Eyre (The Doge), Justine Miceli (Elena), Carla Cassola (Caterina), Michael Culkin (The Bishop) and Charlotte Randle (Francesca).  As Michael Corleone said at one point, ""We're all a part of the same hypocrisy;"" and if there's a lesson to be learned from ""Dangerous Beauty,"" it's that one should not deign to pass judgment on another without first walking in that person's shoes.  It also reminds us of the necessity of maintaining a proper perspective-- and keeping in mind that what's acceptable today may not be acceptable tomorrow.",4,The Tale of the Beautiful

If I know what men like, I'd say yes, but many males would be highly intimidated by her and would feel uncomfortable as they'd feel their power place and prestige lost. Mary Magdalene was the Biblical Dangerous Beauty, her IQ was higher than most of her contemporaries, the selection of a mate or companion was hers  alone, naturally those who were out smarted, or not selected by her, wanted to stone her. But the Messiah saw trough her and saw she was an extraordinary female specimen of the human kind; which later on the Scriptures she probes herself to be an invaluable human being. Read her Gnostic Gospel that tell about her &#34;unique revelations through her relationship with Jesus. Andrew and Peter question her veracity and ask why a woman should become a favourite disciple&#34;, even apostles were vulnerable to the ghost of lost male supremacy.

But you see, it's 16th Century Venice, and Veronica has been pressed into service by her mother to work as a courtesan. If you're out of touch with that era's terminology, a courtesan was a prostitute with wealthy, upper class clients. So she's available to some men for some things, for a price. And she's permitted perks not available to other women, such as access to books.The love of her life, a man of position and stature, does not quite go in the sweet, sentimental manner she had hoped. After a time, she becomes accustomed to her job and uses it to her advantage and that of Venice, by entertaining the King of France sufficiently to convince him to provide much-needed ships at a time of war.However, her love for Marco just won't go away, even after he succumbs to family pressures and marries an appropriately positioned woman. That unhappiness is multiplied many times over when the plague strikes Venice, followed closely by the church's Inquisition. That's when we reach the film's climax.Yes, we'd like to have a deeper understanding of what makes Veronica tick; how she reconciled herself deep down to her un-chosen life situation. And it's sentimental, which might turn some off, but really isn't out of proportion to the story and its other strengths.The film presents a couple of very beautiful nuggets of wisdom:(1) There's a consistent moral thread that runs through every society from age to age and generation to generation, the tenets of which are established within parameters, and therefore subject to change; or more specifically, subject to a change in perspective. And that change can come very quickly -- veritably over night in some instances.(2) That there is also another constant that defines the human condition in any era -- that we will do whatever is necessary to survive. It is simply an undeniable, irrefutable basic instinct of the human animal. Moral tenets and survival, however, taken as properties are something akin to oil and water, and will mix accordingly. Being more often than not polar opposites, conflict is inherent and will ultimately surface at some point or other, the outcome of which is determined by the strength of whichever perspective is prevalent at the moment. And it is at such moments that we discover that life, like politics, can be a sordid, unpleasant affair; or at the other end of the spectrum, the greatest gift of all.This is a rare film, a smart love story that isn't saddled with an overly-predictable outcome. For that and its other assets such as dialog and captivating visuals of Venice, it comes highly recommended from me.",5,TIMELESS MESSAGES WRAPPED IN A SUPERB ROMANTIC PIECE,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",2004,2916,"['Imagine', '*intelligent*', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'beautiful', 'female', 'lead', 'set', 'Venice', 'wafer-crisp', 'witty', 'script', 'brilliant', 'doses', 'worldly', 'wisdom', 'Veronica', 'Catherine', 'McCormack', 'kind', 'woman', 'man', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'who', 'also', 'literate', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'see', '16th', 'Century', 'Venice', 'Veronica', 'been', 'pressed', 'service', 'mother', 'work', 'courtesan', ""'re"", 'touch', 'era', 'terminology', 'courtesan', 'was', 'prostitute', 'wealthy', 'upper', 'class', 'clients', 'available', 'men', 'things', 'price', 'permitted', 'perks', 'not', 'available', 'other', 'women', 'such', 'access', 'books.The', 'love', 'life', 'man', 'position', 'stature', 'not', 'quite', 'go', 'sweet', 'sentimental', 'manner', 'had', 'hoped', 'time', 'accustomed', 'job', 'advantage', 'Venice', 'entertaining', 'King', 'France', 'sufficiently', 'convince', 'provide', 'much-needed', 'ships', 'time', 'war.However', 'love', 'Marco', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'even', 'succumbs', 'family', 'pressures', 'marries', 'appropriately', 'positioned', 'woman', 'unhappiness', 'multiplied', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'plague', 'strikes', 'Venice', 'followed', 'closely', 'church', 'Inquisition', 'when', 'reach', 'film', 'climax.Yes', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'what', 'Veronica', 'tick', 'how', 'reconciled', 'deep', 'down', 'un-chosen', 'life', 'situation', 'sentimental', 'might', 'turn', 'off', 'really', ""n't"", 'proportion', 'story', 'other', 'strengths.The', 'film', 'couple', 'very', 'beautiful', 'nuggets', 'wisdom', '1', 'consistent', 'moral', 'thread', 'society', 'age', 'age', 'generation', 'generation', 'tenets', 'are', 'established', 'parameters', 'therefore', 'subject', 'change', 'more', 'specifically', 'subject', 'change', 'perspective', 'change', 'can', 'come', 'very', 'quickly', 'veritably', 'night', 'instances', '2', 'also', 'constant', 'human', 'condition', 'era', 'will', 'do', 'necessary', 'survive', 'simply', 'undeniable', 'irrefutable', 'basic', 'instinct', 'human', 'animal', 'Moral', 'tenets', 'survival', 'however', 'taken', 'properties', 'are', 'something', 'akin', 'oil', 'water', 'will', 'mix', 'accordingly', 'Being', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'polar', 'opposites', 'conflict', 'inherent', 'will', 'ultimately', 'surface', 'point', 'other', 'outcome', 'determined', 'strength', 'whichever', 'perspective', 'prevalent', 'moment', 'such', 'moments', 'discover', 'life', 'politics', 'can', 'be', 'sordid', 'unpleasant', 'affair', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'greatest', 'gift', 'all.This', 'rare', 'film', 'smart', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'saddled', 'overly-predictable', 'outcome', 'other', 'assets', 'such', 'dialog', 'captivating', 'visuals', 'Venice', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
