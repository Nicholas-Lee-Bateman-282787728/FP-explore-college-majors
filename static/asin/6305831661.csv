480310,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6305831661,Alex Udvary,"[2, 5]","First of all I'm guessing a lot of teens have no idea what my heading means. &quot;Annie Hall&quot; is a Woody Allen film that was made in 1977 and won the &quot;Best Picture&quot; Oscar that year. It was a romantic comedy about a man (Allen) shifting through certain moments of his relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). They used flashbacks,fast fowards, and even animation! Kris Isacsson this film's director is so clearly not only a fan of &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, but HAS to be a Woody Allen fan as well. There's no other way one could explain this film. It's the same thing only done with a teen twist to it. Both films take place one year after their relationships fell through. Both use flashbacks, fast fowards, and the characters are able to comment on past experinces as we (the viewer) watch the scene happen. This was used in &quot;Annie Hall&quot; as well. This movie is about Freddie Prince Jr. trying to figure out what went wrong with his relationship. In the first 45 minutes I liked what I saw. I thought Julia Stiles and Freddie made a good couple. It was a &quot;cute&quot; movie showing teen love. After about an hour the movie now tries to become this profound movie about love. Give me a break! The ideas in this movie are mindless. It's a pretenious showing of the hardships of teen love. Awwww, stop, my heart is breaking here! If you really want to watch a great romantic comedy I suggest watching &quot;Annie Hall&quot;. It's the quintessential romantic comedy of all time. And if you don't believe me watch it and see. You'll noticed almost all romantic comedies made after that movie owe something to it. ** 1\2 out of *****",2,A Teenage &quot;Annie Hall&quot;,965088000,"08 1, 2000",2000,1659,"['First', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'lot', 'teens', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'heading', 'means', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1977', 'won', 'quot', 'Best', 'Picture', 'quot', 'year', 'was', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'man', 'Allen', 'shifting', 'certain', 'moments', 'relationship', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'used', 'flashbacks', 'fast', 'fowards', 'even', 'animation', 'Kris', 'Isacsson', 'film', 'director', 'so', 'clearly', 'not', 'only', 'fan', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'HAS', 'be', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'way', 'one', 'could', 'explain', 'film', 'same', 'thing', 'only', 'done', 'teen', 'twist', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'year', 'relationships', 'fell', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'fast', 'fowards', 'characters', 'are', 'able', 'comment', 'past', 'experinces', 'viewer', 'watch', 'scene', 'happen', 'was', 'used', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'Freddie', 'Prince', 'Jr.', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'relationship', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'liked', 'what', 'saw', 'thought', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Freddie', 'made', 'good', 'couple', 'was', 'quot', 'cute', 'quot', 'movie', 'showing', 'teen', 'love', 'hour', 'movie', 'now', 'become', 'profound', 'movie', 'love', 'Give', 'break', 'ideas', 'movie', 'are', 'mindless', 'pretenious', 'showing', 'hardships', 'teen', 'love', 'Awwww', 'stop', 'heart', 'breaking', 'here', 'really', 'want', 'watch', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'suggest', 'watching', 'quot', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'quot', 'quintessential', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'watch', 'see', ""'ll"", 'noticed', 'almost', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'made', 'movie', 'owe', 'something', '**', '1\\2', '*****']",Down to You VHS

480312,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305831661,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Everyone I know who has seen this tells me I'm kind of stupid for liking it, but I can't help it.  I mean, I actually think it was one of the better romantic comedies (teen oriented of course) of the early 00's.  Remember when Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles were famous?  I do to, and I kind of miss that (well, I miss Stiles, not Prinze Jr.).I actually think that this movie is somewhat unique.  Told from multiple angles by having both Stiles and Prinze Jr.'s characters narrate, the film is far more colorful than most in this genre.  I'm still baffled that this made so many `Worst of the Decade' lists.  I mean, this is no where near as bad as some of the dreck that comes out of Hollywood.  Narrating their college romance, Prinze Jr. and Stiles play Al and Imogen, two very different yet very compatible (opposites do attract) `pretty people'.I don't understand those who say that there is no plot.  The plot is the relationship, nothing more nothing less.I think that, while corny at times, the script is fun and fresh and isn't something you see in every film of this nature.  Both Stiles and Prinze Jr. are charismatic and they have fun with each other and with the scenes.  They aren't the only ones having fun here.  The entire cast does well here.  Sure, it doesn't always come together as crisply as one may want (yes, I know that some scenes leave questions unanswered) but in the end it doesn't really seem to matter too much.And I loved the ending.But what do I know?",4,I'm pretty down with this one...,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,1489,"['Everyone', 'know', 'who', 'seen', ""'m"", 'kind', 'stupid', 'liking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'mean', 'actually', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'teen', 'oriented', 'course', 'early', '00', 'Remember', 'when', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'were', 'famous', 'do', 'kind', 'miss', 'well', 'miss', 'Stiles', 'not', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', '.I', 'actually', 'think', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'Told', 'multiple', 'angles', 'having', 'Stiles', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'characters', 'narrate', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'colorful', 'most', 'genre', ""'m"", 'still', 'baffled', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'Worst', 'Decade', 'lists', 'mean', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'bad', 'dreck', 'Hollywood', 'Narrating', 'college', 'romance', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Stiles', 'play', 'Al', 'Imogen', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'yet', 'very', 'compatible', 'opposites', 'do', 'attract', 'pretty', ""people'.I"", 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'who', 'say', 'plot', 'plot', 'relationship', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less.I', 'think', 'corny', 'times', 'script', 'fun', 'fresh', ""n't"", 'something', 'see', 'film', 'nature', 'Stiles', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'are', 'charismatic', 'have', 'fun', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'ones', 'having', 'fun', 'here', 'entire', 'cast', 'well', 'here', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'always', 'come', 'together', 'as', 'crisply', 'one', 'may', 'want', 'yes', 'know', 'scenes', 'leave', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'matter', 'too', 'much.And', 'loved', 'ending.But', 'what', 'do', 'know']",Down to You VHS
480313,A3LVA6QDZIOBGE,6305831661,Ashegam,"[3, 4]","Very similar to She's All That, and I have a feeling that this is the formula we're going to be seeing for a great deal of time.  Freddie Prinze has had the same sweetheart role in every one of his movies - so I'm starting to look for something different from him... Julia Stiles impressed me - as she has now played the ugly girl (10 Things I Hate About You) and the beautiful girl, and each she seems to let her character show.  Henry Winkler as Chef Ray was a bit over-the-top, but it worked. The script itself was interesting - although quite predictable (aside from the shampoo-drinking incident).  Being so, it had periods where it dragged.  It was obviously written to appeal to the teenage audience, and I'm going to venture that it was drawn up the night after the box-office reviews from &quot;She's All That&quot; reached Isaacson's (writer/director) ears.Overall, it was a pretty good movie.  The actors worked well with the script, although the format was a bit off - the way that it was told from the point of view of Prinze &quot;looking back&quot; on his first love, didn't really work with the ending, as it would have seemed that Prinze had never seen this girl again in the way he was telling the story.

480315,A24456FPYCCSMG,6305831661,Ben hayden,"[0, 0]",When i mean cookie cutter i mean it. Down To You is one ofthose sugar coated roamance movies that is light fluffy mindlessentertainment that it tries to be so sweet and innocent that you could get diabetes from it. Down To You is about a couple of college students in the Big Apple who fall in love. They talk about past relationships and their future they have a fight then get together. They meet the boy's parents although i must say that the fonz Henry Winkler is amusing as a chef.Written and Directed by first timer Kirs Isacsson tries to make something new about this tired genre and smart and funny. But Ultimately is just cliche after cliche. Their is nothing original to the story. Sure Freddie Prinze Jr. is handsome as always but he is just like every other character he has played a pretty boy falling in love. If he dosn't break out of this genre he will be stereotyped as a high school teen idol. Or if you want to the male version of Meg Ryan. Who is always bright and sunny but will never break out of light romances. But it is Julia Stiles who is the better of the two leads.  She is sunny shows some emotional ranges and is very attractive.When you get down to it the only people who will enjoy it will be 15 year old girls who love these kinds of movies. To be fair their is nothing wrong with this movie it had some funny parts mainly with Selma Blair who is a sex crazed attic. Other than that it is predictible and mindless. Nothing that a smart script and some innovative directing wouldn't have cured. Maybe Amy Heckerling would have been more suited who knows the teen romance area.,2,A Cookie Cutter Romance Of A Movie,964396800,"07 24, 2000",2000,1608,"['When', 'i', 'mean', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'i', 'mean', 'Down', 'one', 'ofthose', 'sugar', 'coated', 'roamance', 'movies', 'light', 'fluffy', 'mindlessentertainment', 'be', 'so', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'could', 'get', 'diabetes', 'Down', 'couple', 'college', 'students', 'Big', 'Apple', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'talk', 'past', 'relationships', 'future', 'have', 'fight', 'then', 'get', 'together', 'meet', 'boy', 'parents', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'fonz', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'amusing', 'chef.Written', 'Directed', 'first', 'timer', 'Kirs', 'Isacsson', 'make', 'something', 'new', 'tired', 'genre', 'smart', 'funny', 'Ultimately', 'just', 'cliche', 'cliche', 'nothing', 'original', 'story', 'Sure', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'handsome', 'always', 'just', 'like', 'other', 'character', 'played', 'pretty', 'boy', 'falling', 'love', 'dos', ""n't"", 'break', 'genre', 'will', 'be', 'stereotyped', 'high', 'school', 'teen', 'idol', 'want', 'male', 'version', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Who', 'always', 'bright', 'sunny', 'will', 'never', 'break', 'light', 'romances', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'who', 'better', 'two', 'leads', 'sunny', 'shows', 'emotional', 'ranges', 'very', 'attractive.When', 'get', 'down', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'enjoy', 'will', 'be', '15', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'who', 'love', 'kinds', 'movies', 'be', 'fair', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'had', 'funny', 'parts', 'mainly', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'who', 'sex', 'crazed', 'attic', 'Other', 'predictible', 'mindless', 'Nothing', 'smart', 'script', 'innovative', 'directing', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cured', 'Maybe', 'Amy', 'Heckerling', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suited', 'who', 'teen', 'romance', 'area']",Down to You VHS

480319,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6305831661,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Let's say that a rom com is like a cake. You have the cake--which in this case would be the romance between Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Julia Stiles--Mm mm-Cake! Then you have the frosting--the comic relief with Rosario Dawson, Ashton Kutcher, Henry Winkler, Lucie Arnaz, Jimmy Kimmel, Adam Corolla, and Shawn Hatosy. Then you have a file. Something baked into the cake to give it a little dramatic tension. Some edge. The darkness to offset the light. Here the file would be Zak Orth as an adult film auteur and his protegee, Cyrus, played by Selma Blair. But is this the file, or is it just more frosting? This subplot is so silly and ludicrous that sometimes it is hard to tell.As the film starts the three college friends, Al, Monk, and Eddie, are in their favorite dive. Monk is pontificating, boy does he ever pontificate. For an adult film ""actor"" he acts like he thinks he is a regular Orson Welles or something. Eddie wants to get in the biz so Monk issues a challenge: sleep with freshman Lana (Rosario Dawson) and Monk will get Eddie an audition. Al (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) wonders where he will sleep. Monk points out another freshman. Imogen (Julia Stiles). Is this the film's version of meet cute?I will say at this point that Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Julia Stiles were both very attractive people, but Julia hadn't really hit her stride acting-wise. She is too cerebral. She is a smart girl who will soon take time out to graduate from college, but at this phase of her illustrious career she is too much in her head. She thinks too much to just act--to just react to the other actors. And Prinze, well no one is going to mistake him for the next Olivier, that's for sure. He mostly just looks confused. He's good at that. Director Kris Isacsson doesn't do them any favors having them look directly in the camera and talk about their childhoods. He even has them address each other as the kids they once were. One is grown up, but everyone else in the flashback is young. Woody make it work in Annie Hall, but here not so much. One other thing is that they have zero chemistry together, though you might not notice since Prinze is so darn charming and Stiles has such flamboyant style.Imogen: That kiss belongs in a box, so I can show my grand kids one day.She liked cakes, but they were cheap cakes she buys in convenience stores. The Mm-mm-cakes. Was this product placement? And if she was a spoiled rich brat who summered in France, and he was the son of a chef who wanted to be a chef himself, why did they go nuts over cheap store bought cakes? If a rom com is like a cake, then The icing on this cake was also cheap store bought frosting--full of chemicals and too much processed white sugar.Shawn Hatosy as Eddie was subtle as a rodeo clown. Rosario Dawson was an under utilized resource. Ashton Kutcher played a Jim Morrison clone who was so pretentious that he actually called himself Jim Morrison. Zak Orth as adult film auteur Monk Jablonski was totally ludicrous. This whole adult film subplot, supposed to spice things up, was just a silly distraction. Actually, Selma Blair as Monk's protegee Cyrus, displayed a rather dark intensity that was quite intriguing, but it never went anywhere. Monk actually said things like ""I'm not good with open wounds. You were always my Lancelot, I was just never your king."" No, really. That is an actual line of dialogue. I'm serious.The Bottom Line is that Down to You is not a very good movie. But like the cheap cake they both share a love for, I liked it anyway.The House of Yes(1997)She's All That(1999)10 Things I Hate About You(1999)State and Main(2000)Mona Lisa Smile(2003)Cruel Intentions(1999)The Postman(1997)Rent(2005)Sin City(2005)Dude, Where's My Car?(2000)Imogen: Thank-you, cake is my world!",4,Cake is my world!,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,3765,"['Let', 'say', 'rom', 'com', 'cake', 'have', 'cake', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'romance', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Mm', 'mm-Cake', 'Then', 'have', 'frosting', 'comic', 'relief', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'Lucie', 'Arnaz', 'Jimmy', 'Kimmel', 'Adam', 'Corolla', 'Shawn', 'Hatosy', 'Then', 'have', 'file', 'Something', 'baked', 'cake', 'give', 'little', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'edge', 'darkness', 'offset', 'light', 'Here', 'file', 'would', 'be', 'Zak', 'Orth', 'adult', 'film', 'auteur', 'protegee', 'Cyrus', 'played', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'file', 'just', 'more', 'frosting', 'subplot', 'so', 'silly', 'ludicrous', 'hard', 'tell.As', 'film', 'three', 'college', 'friends', 'Al', 'Monk', 'Eddie', 'are', 'favorite', 'dive', 'Monk', 'pontificating', 'boy', 'ever', 'pontificate', 'adult', 'film', 'actor', 'regular', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'something', 'Eddie', 'get', 'biz', 'so', 'Monk', 'issues', 'challenge', 'sleep', 'freshman', 'Lana', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Monk', 'will', 'get', 'Eddie', 'audition', 'Al', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'where', 'will', 'sleep', 'Monk', 'out', 'freshman', 'Imogen', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'film', 'version', 'meet', 'cute', 'will', 'say', 'point', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'were', 'very', 'attractive', 'people', 'Julia', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'hit', 'stride', 'acting-wise', 'too', 'cerebral', 'smart', 'girl', 'who', 'will', 'soon', 'take', 'time', 'graduate', 'college', 'phase', 'illustrious', 'career', 'too', 'much', 'head', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'act', 'just', 'react', 'other', 'actors', 'Prinze', 'well', 'one', 'going', 'mistake', 'next', 'Olivier', 'sure', 'mostly', 'just', 'confused', 'good', 'Director', 'Kris', 'Isacsson', ""n't"", 'do', 'favors', 'having', 'look', 'directly', 'camera', 'talk', 'childhoods', 'even', 'address', 'other', 'kids', 'once', 'were', 'One', 'grown', 'up', 'everyone', 'else', 'flashback', 'young', 'Woody', 'make', 'work', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'here', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'have', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'together', 'might', 'not', 'notice', 'Prinze', 'so', 'darn', 'charming', 'Stiles', 'such', 'flamboyant', 'style.Imogen', 'kiss', 'belongs', 'box', 'can', 'show', 'grand', 'kids', 'one', 'day.She', 'liked', 'cakes', 'were', 'cheap', 'cakes', 'convenience', 'stores', 'Mm-mm-cakes', 'Was', 'product', 'placement', 'was', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'brat', 'who', 'summered', 'France', 'was', 'son', 'chef', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'chef', 'why', 'did', 'go', 'nuts', 'cheap', 'store', 'bought', 'cakes', 'rom', 'com', 'cake', 'then', 'icing', 'cake', 'was', 'also', 'cheap', 'store', 'bought', 'frosting', 'full', 'chemicals', 'too', 'much', 'processed', 'white', 'sugar.Shawn', 'Hatosy', 'Eddie', 'was', 'subtle', 'rodeo', 'clown', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'was', 'utilized', 'resource', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'played', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'clone', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'pretentious', 'actually', 'called', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Zak', 'Orth', 'adult', 'film', 'auteur', 'Monk', 'Jablonski', 'was', 'totally', 'ludicrous', 'whole', 'adult', 'film', 'subplot', 'supposed', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'distraction', 'Actually', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'Monk', 'protegee', 'Cyrus', 'displayed', 'rather', 'dark', 'intensity', 'was', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'never', 'went', 'anywhere', 'Monk', 'actually', 'said', 'things', ""'m"", 'not', 'good', 'open', 'wounds', 'were', 'always', 'Lancelot', 'was', 'just', 'never', 'king', 'No', 'really', 'actual', 'line', 'dialogue', ""'m"", 'serious.The', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Down', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'cheap', 'cake', 'share', 'love', 'liked', 'House', 'Yes', '1997', '1999', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', '1999', 'State', 'Main', '2000', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'Smile', '2003', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', '1999', 'Postman', '1997', 'Rent', '2005', 'Sin', 'City', '2005', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car', '2000', 'Imogen', 'Thank-you', 'cake', 'world']",Down to You VHS

The main reason why I saw it was  because of Julie Stiles, who I thought was good in 10 Things I Hate About  You. I didn't want to see it at first, because I can't stand Freddie Prinze  Jr!  I thought I'd give it a shot because Julie was in it, and I enjoy  watching high school type movies. This wasn't your typical high school  movie though. It was more towards the late teens/early twenties crowd.  Julie plays Imogen, a Freshman at the local college that's studying to be  an Artist. Freddie plays Al, also a student at the college, that wants to  be a world famous chef, like his father (played by Henry Winkler). Al's  father has his own cooking show on TV (just think Emeril Lagasse). His  father has plans for him and Al to have their own father-son show, but Al  wants to work his way from the bottom up. The main focus of the movie was  concentrated on Imogen and Al's relationship of course. The movie has some  great characters in it, like Al's father, his best friend that's in the  porn industry, and a wanna be Jim Morrison. I thought the story was good,  and the directing as well.

It is so syrupy in fact; that you have to be careful you don't go into diabetic shock.Writer/Director  Kris Isaacson tries very hard to make this the perfect schmaltzy romantic  comedy.  He tries to copy Woody Allen's first person multiple narrative  technique from the perspectives of the two lovers, but unfortunately, his  writing isn't strong enough to make this technique effective.  In the first  part of the film, he tries to depict the perfect college romance.  In the  second part, he tries to portray the jilted lovelorn guy pathetically  drifting with his life bereft of meaning.  The ending; well I'm sure you  can figure it out.Unfortunately, all this accomplishes is to create a  perfectly trite story with characters so clich&eacute; they belong in a soft drink  commercial.  This is why I rated this film a perfect 5/10: perfectly  average.The acting was better than the direction.  Julia Stiles was the  stronger of the two leads.  She was adorable as the misty eyed lover and  actually showed some emotional range as the relationship got into trouble.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. seems to be determined to become a male Meg Ryan, not  daring to venture beyond the safety of light romantic comedy.  He was  adequate in his presentation of the smitten smurf, but his languid  character was such an emotional lightweight that a strong breeze would have  blown him away.I would recommend this as a good date movie for never  married audiences under 25.

However, let's start off with  the positive aspects of the film: I like the fact that we have finally  reached beyond the &quot;high school&quot; settings and into the college  crowd. I also like the fact that we see a little more emotion in the lead  characters, as they are faced with some of life's biggest challenges. But I  must admit that the negatives far outweigh the positives. The story  flounders frequently between being your typical 'teen' flick, a romantic  comedy and a serious drama with social issues. It's hard to really tell  whose side to take. Prinze Jr. and Stiles are good in their roles, but with  very little to do they seem almost decent to be in another movie. Even the  supporting cast lacks depth...Selma Blair and Shawn Hatosy are basically  used only as eye candy and seem almost inserted into slow points of the  film to keep you from falling asleep.

A few nights ago I saw it again, and whew, I must've been out of my mind! Because, without proper analysis and proper depth, this film does indeed seem tricky, even enveloping. But, on a second viewing, I saw that it was nothing but tacky teenage romance mondure.Freddie Prinze Jr plays the son of a famous tv chef who meets and soon falls in love with a college student, played by Julia Stiles. The film then shows the expansion, unraveling, and coming-to-terms sections of their relationships, while each has their own group of friends to nibble at their ears.To be fair, the acting wasn't terrible to stand, and indeed Stiles is a competant enough actress to follow along with what she goes through. But Prinze, as well as other cast members, are never convincing enough to pull through the compost of script material that has been given to them.

This film is neither of those.The movie is presented as a  story told by Imogen (Julia Stiles) and Al (Freddie Prinz, Jr.) about how  they met and fell in love. It begins at a local college bar with Al talking  with his friends Monk (a recently discovered porn star) and Hicks. Monk  challenges Hicks to &quot;hook up&quot; with a freshman to prove to Monk he  has what it takes to also be a porn star. This bet displaces Al for the  night who, is instructed to sleep &quot;with that freshman&quot; pointing  to Imogen. Al wonders over to her and strikes up a conversation ultimatly  leading to their romance.The film locations are overall pretty good.  Locations and scenary compliment the movie very nicely. The park seems to  be the most recurring location for filming including Al's walks with Monk  and the first kiss Al and Imogen share in a beautifully shot scene lit by  the moon.Casting is excellent. It is interesting to watch the evolution  of Al's friends which runs along side the developement of his relationship  with Imogen. There is even an X-Files cameo (The Satanic Substitute Teacher  from Season 1 if anyone cares to know).The soundtrack is an excellent  ecclectic mix, but I am kind of disappointed some songs such as the one in  the bar prior to Dee Lite's &quot;Groove is in the Heart&quot; and GooGoo  Dolls' &quot;Black Balloon&quot; never made it onto the CD but the tracks  that did are very well representing of the movie's musical theme.",5,A Whimsical Story of First Love,966643200,"08 19, 2000",2000,1618,"['Most', 'time', 'tend', 'shy', 'away', 'romance', 'movies', 'simply', 'often', 'are', 'so', 'cloying', 'sick', 'are', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'film', 'those.The', 'movie', 'presented', 'story', 'told', 'Imogen', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Al', 'Freddie', 'Prinz', 'Jr.', 'how', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'local', 'college', 'bar', 'Al', 'talking', 'friends', 'Monk', 'recently', 'discovered', 'porn', 'star', 'Hicks', 'Monk', 'Hicks', 'quot', 'hook', 'up', 'quot', 'freshman', 'prove', 'Monk', 'what', 'also', 'be', 'porn', 'star', 'bet', 'Al', 'night', 'who', 'instructed', 'sleep', 'quot', 'freshman', 'quot', 'pointing', 'Imogen', 'Al', 'up', 'conversation', 'ultimatly', 'leading', 'romance.The', 'film', 'locations', 'are', 'overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'Locations', 'scenary', 'compliment', 'movie', 'very', 'nicely', 'park', 'be', 'most', 'recurring', 'location', 'filming', 'including', 'Al', 'walks', 'Monk', 'first', 'kiss', 'Al', 'Imogen', 'share', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'scene', 'lit', 'moon.Casting', 'excellent', 'interesting', 'watch', 'evolution', 'Al', 'friends', 'side', 'developement', 'relationship', 'Imogen', 'even', 'X-Files', 'cameo', 'Satanic', 'Substitute', 'Teacher', 'Season', '1', 'anyone', 'know', '.The', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'ecclectic', 'mix', 'am', 'kind', 'disappointed', 'songs', 'such', 'one', 'bar', 'prior', 'Dee', 'Lite', 'quot', 'Groove', 'Heart', 'quot', 'GooGoo', 'Dolls', 'quot', 'Black', 'Balloon', 'quot', 'never', 'made', 'CD', 'tracks', 'did', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'representing', 'movie', 'musical', 'theme']",Down to You VHS

480342,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305831661,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 11]","&quot;Down to You&quot; is a romantic comedy that insists on substituting style for substance at key moments in the proceedings. It wants to take a cute approach to a serious relationship, as Al (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and Imogen (Julia Stiles) do a retroactive post mortem on their relationship. The problem, as they both confide to the audience, is that they were too young when they met each other, implying that if only the timing was right the relationship would be right. The tagline for this film was &quot;A new comedy about giving first love a second chance,&quot; which goes beyond the boundaries of either description or foreshadowing enough to warrant losing a star on the rating on that basis alone.Al and Imogen meet at a bar and click immediately, which seems to be more of a surprise to him than to her. She has sworn off dating so can enjoy her college experience, but she is not about to let a rule make her pass on Al who she considers to be cute. He has some strange dorm friends (Selma Blair, Shawn Hatosy, Zak Orth and Rosario Dawson) who want him to swear off on Imogen, but he manages to ignore them most of the time. Meanwhile, the damage caused by his famous chef father (Henry Winkler in a nice turn, with Lucy Arnaz as his wife) does not seem to be too bad since he has the family cooking gene, but we have to wait a long time in this movie for him to grow up enough to be almost good enough for her.Director-writer Kris Isacsson has two personable performers but never really does right by them. She is the more serious of the pair (it will be a long time before Stiles is ever the flighty one in a romantic comedy; it takes a Jason Bourne to get her to back down in a film), and he never really succeeds in bridging the gap to the point where we believe these two have a real chance. Al is just not in her league. The problem is that ultimately this is not a cute film about a serious relationship but a cute film about a cute relationship, and that can be fraught with danger, especially when songs get used to cover up the problems. When the character of Monk in this film becomes the voice of reason, you know the train has left the tracks.",3,Prinze & Stiles deserve better than too cute romantic comedy,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,2171,"['quot', 'Down', 'quot', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'substituting', 'style', 'substance', 'key', 'moments', 'proceedings', 'take', 'cute', 'approach', 'serious', 'relationship', 'Al', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Imogen', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'do', 'retroactive', 'post', 'mortem', 'relationship', 'problem', 'confide', 'audience', 'were', 'too', 'young', 'when', 'met', 'other', 'implying', 'only', 'timing', 'was', 'right', 'relationship', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'tagline', 'film', 'was', 'quot', 'new', 'comedy', 'giving', 'first', 'love', 'second', 'chance', 'quot', 'boundaries', 'description', 'foreshadowing', 'enough', 'warrant', 'losing', 'star', 'rating', 'basis', 'alone.Al', 'Imogen', 'meet', 'bar', 'click', 'immediately', 'be', 'more', 'surprise', 'sworn', 'off', 'dating', 'so', 'can', 'enjoy', 'college', 'experience', 'not', 'let', 'rule', 'make', 'pass', 'Al', 'who', 'be', 'cute', 'strange', 'dorm', 'friends', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'Shawn', 'Hatosy', 'Zak', 'Orth', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'who', 'want', 'swear', 'off', 'Imogen', 'ignore', 'most', 'time', 'Meanwhile', 'damage', 'caused', 'famous', 'chef', 'father', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'nice', 'turn', 'Lucy', 'Arnaz', 'wife', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'too', 'bad', 'family', 'cooking', 'gene', 'have', 'wait', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'grow', 'up', 'enough', 'be', 'almost', 'good', 'enough', 'her.Director-writer', 'Kris', 'Isacsson', 'two', 'personable', 'performers', 'never', 'really', 'right', 'more', 'serious', 'pair', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'time', 'Stiles', 'ever', 'flighty', 'one', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'get', 'back', 'down', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'bridging', 'gap', 'point', 'where', 'believe', 'two', 'have', 'real', 'chance', 'Al', 'just', 'not', 'league', 'problem', 'ultimately', 'not', 'cute', 'film', 'serious', 'relationship', 'cute', 'film', 'cute', 'relationship', 'can', 'be', 'fraught', 'danger', 'especially', 'when', 'songs', 'get', 'used', 'cover', 'up', 'problems', 'When', 'character', 'Monk', 'film', 'voice', 'reason', 'know', 'train', 'left', 'tracks']",Down to You VHS

It starts off with Freddie Prinz Jnr (Al) and Julia Stiles (Imogen) narrating between flashbacks.Julia Stiles is one of the best young actresses of the moment, and her &amp; Freddie Prinz Jnr make a great couple. Selma Blair, Shawn Hatosy and Zak Orth also star, along with a permanently stoned Ashton Kutcher, who apparently looks like Jim Morrison from The Doors.The scene where Imogen sings/dances to Al is the best, and it shows what the whole film is about - despite the fact that Al gets embarrassed as he's a sophomore dating a freshman.Imogen &amp; Al are very different people and show that opposites can attract. She likes painting and he likes to cook. Al's friends aren't happy that Al &amp; Imogen are practically turning into an old married couple before their eyes, already having a pregnancy scare barely a year into their relationship. You know this relationship is doomed from the start of the film, due to them being different &amp; pressure from their friends.The narration between the flashback scenes does break the film up, and the first time I watched this film, it really annoyed me, but it also shows the film from Al &amp; Imogen's point of view.There's a classic line in this, which is Imogen's fear: ""One day we'll pass each other on the street and have that artificial conversation"".The ending is great, and the Billie Myers song sums up the whole film.This film is a must-see for Julia Stiles/Freddie Prinz Jnr fans, or to see as a couple, or to watch alone, simply to reminisce and not get embarrassed when you start crying.Extras include the theatrical trailer; TV spots; cast &amp; crew interviews; on the set; and Billie Myer's ""It All Comes Down To You"" music video.",5,The perfect date movie,1063584000,"09 15, 2003",2003,1833,"['perfect', 'romance', 'film', 'watch', 'couple', 'remember', 'first', 'love', 'reminisce', 'good', 'bad', 'times', 'Freddie', 'Prinz', 'Jnr', 'Al', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Imogen', 'narrating', 'flashbacks.Julia', 'Stiles', 'one', 'best', 'young', 'actresses', 'moment', 'amp', 'Freddie', 'Prinz', 'Jnr', 'make', 'great', 'couple', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'Shawn', 'Hatosy', 'Zak', 'Orth', 'also', 'star', 'permanently', 'stoned', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'who', 'apparently', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Doors.The', 'scene', 'where', 'Imogen', 'Al', 'best', 'what', 'whole', 'film', 'fact', 'Al', 'embarrassed', 'sophomore', 'dating', 'freshman.Imogen', 'amp', 'Al', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'show', 'opposites', 'can', 'attract', 'painting', 'cook', 'Al', 'friends', 'are', ""n't"", 'happy', 'Al', 'amp', 'Imogen', 'are', 'practically', 'turning', 'old', 'married', 'couple', 'eyes', 'already', 'having', 'pregnancy', 'scare', 'barely', 'year', 'relationship', 'know', 'relationship', 'doomed', 'start', 'film', 'due', 'being', 'different', 'amp', 'pressure', 'friends.The', 'narration', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'break', 'film', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'film', 'really', 'annoyed', 'also', 'film', 'Al', 'amp', 'Imogen', 'point', 'view.There', 'classic', 'line', 'Imogen', 'fear', 'One', 'day', ""'ll"", 'pass', 'other', 'street', 'have', 'artificial', 'conversation', '.The', 'ending', 'great', 'Billie', 'Myers', 'song', 'sums', 'up', 'whole', 'film.This', 'film', 'must-see', 'Julia', 'Stiles/Freddie', 'Prinz', 'Jnr', 'fans', 'see', 'couple', 'watch', 'alone', 'simply', 'reminisce', 'not', 'get', 'embarrassed', 'when', 'start', 'crying.Extras', 'include', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'TV', 'spots', 'cast', 'amp', 'crew', 'interviews', 'set', 'Billie', 'Myer', 'Comes', 'Down', 'music', 'video']",Down to You VHS

480349,A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ,6305831661,"Mr. JKW ""jkw""","[1, 2]","THE STORY:Freddy Prinze Jr. (She's All That, Summer Catch, etc) and Julia Stiles (Ten Things I Hate About You, Save the Last Dance, O, etc.) play Al and Imogen who through a series of flashbacks and weird cut-aways recount their on-again/off-again romance.  Overall, deep down inside the story is probably pretty nice - IF YOU CAN TOLERATE THE STORYTELLING TO THE VERY END.In sum, the countless flashbacks and seemingly pointless cut-aways will leave you confused, frustrated and ultimately very bored!!!  I personally stopped watching the movie about 40 minutes into the rental.  My fianc&eacute; managed to make it to the end but even she said the movie ""was not that good"" and ""was not worth the rental"" (well, it's a paraphrase as a little more colorful language was used) citing the same reasons (confusing jumps from scene-to-scene, etc).Overall, I think this movie suffers from the ""promising story, BAD execution"" syndrome.THE DVD Features:A little sparse on DVD special features the DVD also includes these:1. Billy Myers ""It All Came Down To You"" music video:  An alright feature, but not alone worth the DVD2. A ""making of the music video"" special:  a 45 second video set to the song.  45 seconds???  Geez, what was the point???3. Trailers for two other movies, ""She's All That"" (starring male lead Freddie Prinze Jr.) and ""Ten Things I Hate About You"" (starring female lead Julia Stiles).THE VERDICT:In all, it's safe for me to say that if you've never seen this you're probably better off saving your money and renting/buying some better movies to watch (such as the two other movies featured in the trailers section).  In all, unless you don't mind the non-sensical storytelling you're off probably - most definitely - better off spending your time and money on another movie.Apparently, I wasn't the only who felt this way about the movie as I remember it not lasting more than a month in the theatres before it was yanked when it first came out.Recommendation to Take A Pass and Rent/Buy Something Better...",2,Nice Story &#65533; Bad Storytelling,1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,2023,"['STORY', 'Freddy', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Summer', 'Catch', 'etc', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Ten', 'Things', 'Hate', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'O', 'etc', 'play', 'Al', 'Imogen', 'who', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'weird', 'cut-aways', 'recount', 'on-again/off-again', 'romance', 'Overall', 'deep', 'inside', 'story', 'probably', 'pretty', 'nice', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'TOLERATE', 'THE', 'STORYTELLING', 'TO', 'THE', 'VERY', 'END.In', 'sum', 'countless', 'flashbacks', 'seemingly', 'pointless', 'cut-aways', 'will', 'leave', 'confused', 'frustrated', 'ultimately', 'very', 'bored', 'personally', 'stopped', 'watching', 'movie', '40', 'minutes', 'rental', 'My', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'managed', 'make', 'end', 'even', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'was', 'not', 'rental', 'well', 'paraphrase', 'little', 'more', 'colorful', 'language', 'was', 'used', 'citing', 'same', 'reasons', 'confusing', 'jumps', 'scene-to-scene', 'etc', '.Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'promising', 'story', 'BAD', 'execution', 'syndrome.THE', 'DVD', 'Features', 'little', 'sparse', 'DVD', 'special', 'DVD', 'also', 'these:1', 'Billy', 'Myers', 'Came', 'Down', 'music', 'video', 'alright', 'feature', 'not', 'alone', 'DVD2', 'A', 'making', 'music', 'video', 'special', '45', 'second', 'video', 'set', 'song', '45', 'seconds', 'Geez', 'what', 'was', 'point', '3', 'Trailers', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'starring', 'male', 'lead', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Ten', 'Things', 'Hate', 'starring', 'female', 'lead', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'VERDICT', 'safe', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', ""'re"", 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'saving', 'money', 'renting/buying', 'better', 'movies', 'watch', 'such', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'featured', 'trailers', 'section', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'non-sensical', 'storytelling', ""'re"", 'off', 'probably', 'most', 'definitely', 'better', 'off', 'spending', 'time', 'money', 'movie.Apparently', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'who', 'felt', 'way', 'movie', 'remember', 'not', 'lasting', 'more', 'month', 'theatres', 'was', 'yanked', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out.Recommendation', 'Take', 'A', 'Pass', 'Rent/Buy', 'Something', 'Better']",Down to You VHS

Stiles and Prinze do a good job in their lead  roles.  Selma Blair and the actor who played Alfred's  &quot;artsy-fartsy&quot; porn actor friend were also entertaining.
