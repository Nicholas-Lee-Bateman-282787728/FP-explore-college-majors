I am thrilled to have this set because now I have the Rainbirds and of course I have the set where the two reappeared in another Midsomer Murder case, this time as sister and cousin of the Rainbirds.

880725,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0007GP70U,C. O. DeRiemer,"[42, 42]","There are bodies aplenty in the cosy, peaceful villages located in Midsomer County. All of the little picture-perfect villages and small towns have a wide and varied assortment of English citizens, ranging from wealthy magistrates and high Church of England prelates to milkmen and shopkeepers, wives and lovers, thieves and...a lot of murderers. The corpses are just as varied as the living. Barnaby must apply all his experience, skepticism, persistence and unflappability to catch the culprits.In Set Five, Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) and his sergeant, Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey) deal with two cases which are uncommonly complex and satisfying. In one, it is the case, itself, which is so good. In the other, it is the excellent performance by one of Britain's best actors, Bernard Hepton.In Death of a Hollow Man, Hepton plays Harold Winstanley, an aging, flamboyant man of the theater, now reduced to directing a regional play in the community theater of Causton. There are red herrings, private passions and young ambition. Through it all, Winstanley remembers what he believes were his glory days. He can almost taste vindication for himself in his new play. Bernard Hepton brings a wide range of emotions to the part, and they all are believable. He was 73 when he made this program. To get an idea of his range and skill, watch him in The Charmer (1987) as Donald Stimpson, an apparently mild man who plots revenge; in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (1979) and Smiley's People (1982) as Toby Esterhaze, a weak, sly department head in The Circus; and as Archbishop Cranmer, a man of the cloth you'd be most unwise to make your confession to, in Elizabeth R (1971) and The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970).In The Killings at Badger's Drift, Barnaby finds himself in the middle of a series of murders that involve a level of ruthlessness which is startling...not to mention cosy blackmail, revenge, neediness and sexual shenanigans that are both lusty and sad. Surprisingly, there are no red herrings here. Every bit of murder, blackmail, poisonous mushrooms and shotgun blasts has a purpose, and still the final revelation comes as a shock.For the record, Set Five's other three mysteries are: Faithful Unto Death, set in the village of Fawcett Green, Death in Disguise, set in the Lodge of the Golden Windhorse, and Written in Blood, set in Midsomer Worthy. Each program runs about 100 minutes.The charm of this series lies partly in its setting. Midsomer County is a very pretty place, green and cared for. The towns are tidy, filled with competent and knowledgeable tradesmen; the villages tend to have a few eccentrics and a lot of thatched roofs. This could be much too cosy except for three things. First, the performance by John Nettles. He's a fine actor who is completely at home in the role. Watching his Barnaby think his way through clever mysteries, unfailingly polite and unfailingly unintimidated, is a pleasure. Second, the mysteries themselves. This series has been going on through eight seasons. DVD sets are out for six of them so far. The mysteries are almost always real puzzlers; not flashy, but well disguised. They are consistently interesting and well written. Third, the quality of the production and the actors. I suspect a substantial budget has been allocated for each episode. The series looks first-rate. The actors are first-rate, too, which is typical of British productions which find their way over here. Daniel Casey does a fine job as Barnaby's assistant. He respects his boss and is smart enough to learn from him. But he also can be exasperated at Barnaby's penchant for not sharing everything. And he occasionally gets put out when an apparently important car trip (Troy almost always drives them) turns out to be a trip for a bacon sandwich Barnaby's been thinking about. Barnaby's wife is played by Jane Wymark, and it's a pleasure to observe how much at ease the two actors are with each other. They play a long-married couple, still in love and with a comfortable kind of middle-aged affection for each other. All the actors do outstanding jobs, and there usually is a sprinkling of well-known names.If you're in the mood for civilized British television mysteries, where the mean streets have more cobblestones than crushed beer cans, where the occasional drug user is not a grubby petty thief but an upper-class wife, where the chief copper has a happy home life and no angst to share with the viewers, Midsomer Murders might be just the thing.The programs in each set do not reflect very accurately the order in which the programs appear in each season's series. It doesn't make any difference since each mystery is self-contained. The DVD picture is excellent. There are a few extras such as a map of Midsomer County showing the towns and villages, cast filmographies of the major players and a biography of Carolyn Graham, the author of the books the series is based on.",5,"DCI Barnaby solves two great, dramatic murder cases and three satisfying ones in Midsomer Murders-Set Five",1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,4947,"['are', 'bodies', 'aplenty', 'cosy',

880726,A2CISZ4JLKQRJA,B0007GP70U,C. Richard,"[0, 0]","This is actually the first season's episodes of this program. Not sure why it is called Set Five.I think this is a really great detective series, but it might take some getting used to for some. You might need a British sense of humor/outlook to fully appreciate it.The first episode, The Killings at Badger's Drift, is really a bit strange. And the older detective does kind of pick on the younger one to a larger extent than seems called for in the context of the story. But, as the series progresses, the stories get better and the detectives get along better.In other words, if you don't like the first episode, try a few more before deciding if you'll continue watching. I think I watched the first five seasons in a few weeks. It got pretty addictive after I gave it a chance.The series pokes fun at British village life as it goes along - the episodes are all set in various English villages in the fictional county of Midsomer. They don't seem as safe and nice as you might think - at least as this series presents it. All in good fun I guess. Well, at least one person gets murdered in every episode, so maybe fun is not the right word.

Sure enough this set of films was made arond 1996-7 and therefore predates some of the earlier sets released by Acorn Media. This is not a problem, but I am concious of Barnaby's entire family appearing much younger, and Sgt Troy so new to the force he is still pointing out the obvious to Barnaby, and failing to notice some things he should. Barnaby's daughter is back in school and trying to decide whether to change her school major to acting. (Often her acting provides a clue toward solving a murder.) Everyone has longer hair and is thinner.The second episode (of five) is my favorite so far. (These episodes are so good I am not going to rush through them just so I can tell you about them.) At one point, Barnaby's daughter brings home a Russian kitty she has named 'Killmouski' who soon takes over Barnaby's bed, chair and everything else--if you live with a cat you can imagine the interaction.The plots in these episodes are the best in the series and I have watched all the films in the other sets. These early stories seem more like the early Morse episodes in complexity, and like them must have been based on real books, not relatively underdeveloped screen plays. The characters are well developed. Each of the mysteries in the MidSomers series is set in a different mythical village in Southern England and constitute what Diana Rigg calls ""cozy"" mysteries that could be updates of the Marple novels (the plots are different).Morse fans will recognize JoAnna David, as well as several other supporting actors, and 'Rebbecca' fans will recognize Anna Massey. Jonathan Firth (who has many facial tics similar to those of Colin Firth--are they related?) appears in an episode involving a shocking discovery by an older retired teacher (who ends up dead).

880737,AOCVPRFNS2IKN,B0007GP70U,Lover of English,"[10, 23]","I bought Set Five of Midsomer Murders based on a chronology given by a reviewer on Amazon.  If I am going to start a series I like to follow it in chonological order.  I didn't see the series on TV but the reviewer stated that the first episodes were contained in Set Five.  I am 2/5ths of the way through this boxed set and I am baffled by the great reviews that this series has garnered.These two first episodes present some of the nastiest persons that it has ever been my misfortune to encounter. Life is way too short to spend it with people who are so mean-spirited.  First of all, Inspector Barnaby is constantly and unnecessarily sarcastic to his young Sargeant.  There is no reason for this except for unkindness of spirit.  Secondly, in these two episodes everyone sneers at everyone else.  Even if there were no other faults in these episodes who with a healthy mind would want to spend time with these really unpleasant people.  But there are many other things wrong. The killer(s) turn out to be two self-absorbed young people - brother and sister - who have been having an incestuous relationshiop since they were teens and who killed in order to make way for the sister to marry a widower whom they then plan to kill for his money.  There is a hideous mother-and-son blackmailing duo who are grotesque and sickening in their relationship.  But all these nasty people, unpleasant as they are, pale in comparison to those in Episode Two.In Episode Two we have sexual abuse of a young boy by his father, patricide, transvestites and the sort of teenagers that reminded me of Lord of the Flies.  A high school drama club decides to entice their drama teacher to have a sexual relationship with one of the fifteen-year-old girls, photographs him and then, as a group, sends him the photos and tries to blackmail him for money.  When he declines to pay these little monsters post the pictures on the village green so that the whole town can see them.  And, as usual, everyone is sneering at everyone else all of the time.Except for Inspector Barnaby's wife and daughter there doesn't seem to be a single normal human being in these first two episodes and I am really at a loss to understand the fulsome praise that this series has received.  If one wants to see life in an English village I'll take Miss Marple every time.  There are unusual characters to be sure but the overriding miasma of plain mastiness and meanness that I've encountered in Midsomer Murders is entirely absent in the Agatha Christie characters as developed in Miss Marple and in Hercule Poirot.I will watch the next three episodes because I bought them but I am fearful of what horrors next lie in store.

They investigate crimes in the Thames valley and cities as large as Oxford, midsize towns like a certain Kingsmarkham, and villages with such all-English names as St. Mary Mead or King's Abbot. And they have been portrayed by some of Britain's finest contemporary actors, from Jeremy Brett and David Burke/Edward Hardwicke (Sherlock Holmes & Doctor Watson) to Roy Marsden (Commander Adam Dalgliesh), Patrick Malahide and William Simons (D.C.I. Roderick Alleyn & D.I. ""Br'er"" Fox), John Thaw and Kevin Whately (D.C.I. Morse & D.S. Lewis), David Jason (D.I. ""Jack"" Frost), George Baker and Christopher Ravenscroft (D.C.I. Reginald Wexford & D.I. Mike Burden), Peter Davison and Brian Glover (Albert Campion & Magersfontein Lugg), Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter (Lord Peter Wimsey & Harriet Vane), David Suchet/Albert Finney (Hercule Poirot) and last but not least Joan Hickson as Miss Jane Marple, the grandmother of all English village detectives.To that illustrious group, British author Caroline Graham in 1987 added another sleuthing couple, the middle-aged D.C.I. Tom Barnaby and his young colleague D.S. Gavin Troy, coppers in a cluster of villages which, collectively, make up an area known as Midsomer County, and which could easily rival Agatha Christie's very own St. Mary Mead in per-capita occurrences of treachery, crime, and bloodletting. The series' first entry, ""The Killings at Badgers Drift,"" was so successful that it won a Macavity Award for best first mystery and, for its author, an instant loyal following. Before long, the books had spawned a television series, which at almost 50 episodes has long since outrun the number of its print originals. Starring as Barnaby and Troy are Royal Shakespeare Company alumnus John Nettles, best known to TV audiences as Jerseyan Detective Sergeant Jim Bergerac in the 1980s' series of the same name (based on the books by Andrew Saville), and Daniel Casey, whose most notable other roles to date have been appearances in the BBC's ""Our Friends in the North,"" ITV's ""Steel River Blues"" (for which he gave up ""Midsomer Murders"" in 2004), and the 1998 Catherine Cookson adaptation ""The Wingless Bird."" Nettles and Casey are an engaging team, not quite faithful to their characters' literary versions - which however works well to their advantage; particularly in the case of Daniel Casey's Troy, who despite a certain learning curve in political correctness is less brash than in the books, and who presents a good foil for Nettles's emphatic Barnaby; in turn overall more reminiscent of George Baker's Wexford than of Nettles's own Bergerac, whose domestic bliss is spoiled, again and again, by the callings of his job, to his regret as much as to that of his culinarily-challenged wife Joyce (Jane Wymark) and theater-bound daughter Cully (Laura Howard); yet, he is to much of a professional not to heed those callings every single time.Inexplicably only released as the fifth ""region 1"" DVD set, the series's first five episodes (contained in this collection) provide a most welcome opportunity for fans of the series to reacquaint themselves with the very first cases solved by this winning pair of detectives, as well as the not-so peaceful, albeit wonderfully filmed setting of rural Midsomer County. Crucially, they also include the TV version of ""The Killings at Badgers Drift,"" which (re-)introduced the characters of Barnaby and Troy (as had Caroline Graham's book, ten years earlier), and among whose high profile roster of guest stars were screen luminaries and TV regulars such as Elizabeth Spriggs, Jonathan Firth, Rosalie Crutchley, Julian Glover, Christopher Villiers and Renee Asherson. In addition to the 1997 pilot, this set features the series's complete first season (1998) and one episode from the second (1999) season:The Killings at Badger's Drift (1997)Written in Blood (1998)Death of a Hollow Man (1998)Faithful Unto Death (1998)Death in Disguise (1999)Also recommended:The Killings at Badger's Drift (Inspector Barnaby Mysteries)Midsomer Murders - The Early Cases CollectionInspector Morse - Complete CollectionRuth Rendell Mysteries - Simisola / Road RageP.D.

880748,A2BJ81NT43LKSM,B0007GP70U,"Toki Mike ""amateur polymath""","[3, 3]","By chance, I bought a set of ""Midsomer Murders"" and now I own all 16 sets that have been published so far.  Set 5 is the best, and the stories in Set 5 include all 5 of the Catherine Graham novels set in fictional Midsomer County that have been televised, including the BBC pilot, ""The Murders at Badger's Drift"". The productions are lavish and set in the lovely English countryside and manor houses.  The plots are intricate and the solutions satisfying.  In spite of multiple murders in each episode, the violence is never dwelt on.  The domestic life of Chief Inspector Barnaby clearly works to lighten the tone.  Each character seems to be finely drawn.  Barnaby's dry wit introduces many comic moments.  The acting is superb, and the plots are well crafted.  In fact, I enjoy watching the episodes as much or more the second or even the third time as I did the first time, even if I remember who the murderer is. Don't miss Set 5.  And if you enjoy it, start saving your pennies to buy the rest of the sets!",5,Stellar premiere of an enjoyable murder myustery series,1282694400,"08 25, 2010",2010,1012,"['chance', 'bought', 'set', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'now', 'own', '16', 'sets', 'have', 'been', 'published', 'so', 'far', 'Set', '5', 'best', 'stories', 'Set', '5', 'include', '5', 'Catherine', 'Graham', 'novels', 'set', 'fictional', 'Midsomer', 'County', 'have', 'been', 'televised', 'including', 'BBC', 'pilot', 'Murders', 'Badger', 'Drift', 'productions', 'are', 'lavish', 'set', 'lovely', 'English', 'countryside', 'manor', 'houses', 'plots', 'are', 'intricate', 'solutions', 'satisfying', 'spite', 'multiple', 'murders', 'episode', 'violence', 'never', 'dwelt', 'domestic', 'life', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Barnaby', 'clearly', 'lighten', 'tone', 'character', 'be', 'finely', 'drawn', 'Barnaby', 'dry', 'wit', 'introduces', 'many', 'comic', 'moments', 'acting', 'superb', 'plots', 'are', 'well', 'crafted', 'fact', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'episodes', 'much', 'more', 'second', 'even', 'third', 'time', 'did', 'first', 'time', 'even', 'remember', 'who', 'murderer', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Set', '5', 'enjoy', 'start', 'saving', 'pennies', 'buy', 'rest', 'sets']",Midsomer Murders - Set Five: (The Killings at Badger's Drift / Written in Blood / Death of a Hollow Man / Faithful unto Death / Death in Disguise)

I'm an Anglophile from way back when and love just about all British TV, especially their comedies and crime drams. Midsomer Murders is one of the rare few crime dramas that puzzle me. I usually figure out quite quickly ""who done it?"" in most crime drama/mystery/suspense show and films I watch, which takes some of the fun out of it for me. So far out of viewing ten episodes of Midsomer, I was able to guess accurately who the killer was in just 2. This is an interesting, aborbsing, though-provoking and entertaining series. You have to watch it to know what is going on. You can't just listen and do something else at the same time.I just purchased my first set of DVD's, Set 5. The only problem I had was that the new set I ordered from Amazon, not a market place seller was that my set contained two identical DVD's and no disc 5 of the series. I certainly didn't expect that from purchasing a new set from Amazon. I was a bit disappointed and annoyed. Since the order was fulfilled by one of their sellers, Amazon stated that they can only refund my money and not send a replacement. So be forwarned, if you order this set. When I went back to Amazon to reorder another new set, the price jumped up to $6.00 more than what I had originally paid. Shame on you Amazon for making this purchase a pain in the neck. I've been shopping regularly with Amazon for at least 10 years now and have never experienced such a bad purchase. I did not get what I paid for here. Now I have to go to a UPS drop off to return the package and buy this set used from a Market place seller or wait until Amazon drops the price to what I paid. Or deal with a foreign rep in chatting or calling Amazon to see if they'll give me a new set for what I originally paid.",4,WARNING: My New set DIDN'T contain Disc 5!!!.,1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,1800,"['Love', 'show', 'not', 'purchase', 'love', 'show', ""'m"", 'Anglophile', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'love', 'just', 'British', 'TV', 'especially', 'comedies', 'crime', 'drams', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'one', 'rare', 'few', 'crime', 'dramas', 'usually', 'figure', 'out', 'quite', 'quickly', 'who', 'done', 'most', 'crime', 'drama/mystery/suspense', 'show', 'films', 'watch', 'fun', 'So', 'far', 'viewing', 'ten', 'episodes', 'Midsomer', 'was', 'able', 'guess', 'accurately', 'who', 'killer', 'was', 'just', '2', 'interesting', 'aborbsing', 'though-provoking', 'entertaining', 'series', 'have', 'watch', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'listen', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'same', 'time.I', 'just', 'purchased', 'first', 'set', 'DVD', 'Set', '5', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'new', 'set', 'ordered', 'Amazon', 'not', 'market', 'place', 'seller', 'was', 'set', 'contained', 'two', 'identical', 'DVD', 'disc', '5', 'series', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'purchasing', 'new', 'set', 'Amazon', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'annoyed', 'order', 'was', 'fulfilled', 'one', 'sellers', 'Amazon', 'stated', 'can', 'only', 'refund', 'money', 'not', 'send', 'replacement', 'So', 'be', 'forwarned', 'order', 'set', 'When', 'went', 'back', 'Amazon', 'reorder', 'new', 'set', 'price', 'jumped', '6.00', 'more', 'what', 'had', 'originally', 'paid', 'Shame', 'Amazon', 'making', 'purchase', 'pain', 'neck', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shopping', 'regularly', 'Amazon', 'least', '10', 'years', 'now', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'bad', 'purchase', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'what', 'paid', 'here', 'Now', 'have', 'go', 'UPS', 'drop', 'return', 'package', 'buy', 'set', 'used', 'Market', 'place', 'seller', 'wait', 'Amazon', 'price', 'what', 'paid', 'deal', 'foreign', 'rep', 'chatting', 'calling', 'Amazon', 'see', ""'ll"", 'give', 'new', 'set', 'what', 'originally', 'paid']",Midsomer Murders - Set Five: (The Killings at Badger's Drift / Written in Blood / Death of a Hollow Man / Faithful unto Death / Death in Disguise)
