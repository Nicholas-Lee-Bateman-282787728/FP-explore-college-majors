The best thing  is that they manage a great werewolf movie with little gore. There is adult  content/language. The plot is evenly paced and clever. A book editor gets  bitten by a wolf while experiencing a professional/life crisis. And he  slowly begins to develop better senses and transforms into a werewolf.  Nicholson required the least amount of makeup I've ever seen, until the him  and an enemy werewolf duel at the end. Jack played his role VERY well,  especially as a werewolf. Pfiefer was also good as the love interest. The  not too over use of slow motion adds to the mood and works surprisingly  well. One word of advice: If you want to enjoy this movie, don't view it as  a critic. The music works well in some parts, but could've been improved to  add more chill.

Are you sure?"" everyone keeps asking him). Great star power, atmosphere, and lush interiors in this film, with Pfeiffer as the blue-blood, sarcastic street-smart and estranged daughter of Will's ruthless boss (played beautifully by Christopher Plummer) who replaces Will as senior editor of the publishing house he takes over, with younger, upstart punk Stewart (played by the flawless James Spader who is seemingly BORN to play these kinds of roles) and who we could really refer to as a ""wolf-in-sheep's clothing"" because he has everyone fooled that he is really a nice guy instead of the ruthless backstabbing coward he really is. David Hyde Pierce is also perfectly cast as Will's coworker and buddy who stands by him and whose role could have been expanded so he would have had more screen time, but hey, I'll take what I can get. The story is a refreshing and original modernization of the werewolf tale that has been told a thousand different ways that we have all seen throughout the history of cinema, complete with humor and gore and plot twists that keep it fresh and exciting. They even retained the mystical element of the story as well, but keeping it relevant with this day and age (Will's transformation enables him to deal with these hard situations in a way he was not previously capable of, so it is a joy, in a way, to see him come into his own so the deserving people get what's coming to them) and the effects on the different interpersonal relationships of the characters. The strange, slow-mo ending sequences of the film fall short compared to the first part of the movie (would a climactic werewolf battle include using gardening tools as weapons and attempted rape? um, probably not, but hey, suspension of disbelief is important here), but are unique and interesting enough to keep you guessing as to how the action will end and who will survive. Sit down with a hot cup of tea on a stormy night and enjoy this great re-telling of a classic horror movie story complete with humor, horror, and some great star power, which also includes Prunella Scales (remember Fawlty Towers?), David Jenkins, Kate Nelligan, Eileen Atkins, Ron Rifkin (who has one of the funniest lines in the film), and Allison Janney and David Schwimmer in bit parts - no pun intended!",4,This Wolf Blows The House Down,1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,2589,"['Jack', 'Nicholson', 'perfect', 'gentle', 'mild-mannered', 'protagonist', 'Will', 'who', 'slowly', 'transformed', 'being', 'bitten', 'stretch', 'dark', 'lonely', 'road', 'snow', 'hitting', 'wolf', 'car', 'then', 'climbing', 'out', 'investigate', 'perhaps', 'creepiest', 'scene', 'movie', 'wolf', 'Vermont', 'Are', 'sure', 'everyone', 'asking', 'Great', 'star', 'power', 'atmosphere', 'lush', 'interiors', 'film', 'Pfeiffer', 'blue-blood', 'sarcastic', 'street-smart', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Will', 'ruthless', 'boss', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'who', 'replaces', 'Will', 'senior', 'editor', 'publishing', 'house', 'over', 'younger', 'upstart', 'punk', 'Stewart', 'played', 'flawless', 'James', 'Spader', 'who', 'seemingly', 'BORN', 'play', 'kinds', 'roles', 'who', 'could', 'really', 'refer', 'wolf-in-sheep', 'clothing', 'everyone', 'fooled', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'instead', 'ruthless', 'backstabbing', 'coward', 'really', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'also', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Will', 'coworker', 'buddy', 'who', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'hey', ""'ll"", 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'story', 'refreshing', 'original', 'modernization', 'werewolf', 'tale', 'been', 'told', 'thousand', 'different', 'ways', 'have', 'seen', 'history', 'cinema', 'complete', 'humor', 'gore', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'even', 'retained', 'mystical', 'element', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'keeping', 'relevant', 'day', 'age', 'Will', 'transformation', 'deal', 'hard', 'situations', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'previously', 'capable', 'joy', 'way', 'see', 'come', 'own', 'so', 'deserving', 'people', 'get', 'what', 'coming', 'effects', 'different', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'characters', 'strange', 'slow-mo', 'ending', 'sequences', 'film', 'fall', 'short', 'compared', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'would', 'climactic', 'werewolf', 'battle', 'include', 'using', 'gardening', 'tools', 'weapons', 'attempted', 'rape', 'um', 'probably', 'not', 'hey', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'important', 'here', 'are', 'unique', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'guessing', 'how', 'action', 'will', 'end', 'who', 'will', 'survive', 'Sit', 'down', 'hot', 'cup', 'tea', 'stormy', 'night', 'enjoy', 'great', 're-telling', 'classic', 'horror', 'movie', 'story', 'complete', 'humor', 'horror', 'great', 'star', 'power', 'also', 'Prunella', 'Scales', 'remember', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'David', 'Jenkins', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Ron', 'Rifkin', 'who', 'one', 'funniest', 'lines', 'film', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'bit', 'parts', 'pun', 'intended']",Wolf

Menacing and tender, ruthless and soft, he is a great screen presence.  This picture moved rather slowly as modern-day pictures go, savoring every detail and allowing the plot to build.  Mrs. Fawlty and Frasier's brother had bit parts.  And James Spader did what he does best - played the ultimate slime with the manners of a choir boy.  (If you haven't checked out ""Boston Legal"", Tuesdays, 9pm, ABC, you are missing two great actors at the top of their game, plus some very fabulous plots)  The office shots where Spader and Nicholson work are of a marvelously restored old building interior.  Would love to know what it was.  Jack was looking bad in the beginning, but progresses to look better as the wolf blood takes hold.  As one newspaper reviewer noted, ""he radiates predatory self-confidence"", something I think he has done in all his roles.  The movie has a very romantic core, as Jack and Michelle come together and try to battle the wolf problem.  At one point, as Nicholson is descending into his wolf persona, he stands before Pheiffer and says to her some of the best stuff I've heard since Mel Gibson in ""Mrs. Soffle"".

165579,A2HVL790PBWYTU,0800177029,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[31, 36]","For those who had never seen Jack Nicholson play it meek in a movie, this may be as meek as dude gets (and then it only lasts for about half an hour). In WOLF, Nicholson plays middle-aged softie Will Randall, a mild-mannered hubbie locked in a marriage of indifference. Will is also the editor-in-chief of a respected New York publishing agency - that is, until he gets demoted, at which point he assumes this indignant but resigned look. As it turns out, this would only be the first in a series of betrayals, and Will Randall looks to be just another in a long line of easily dismissed victims. Except...WOLF starts out in a snowy, moonlit scene in which Will Randall, motoring from Vermont to Manhattan, is bitten by a wolf he had accidentally run over. And soon the shocking changes begin to manifest. Will feels strangely rejuvenated, even as he develops extremely heightened senses. Suddenly he's able to eavesdrop from across the atrium, sniff out morning liquor on a co-worker's breath, and hurdle tall walls in slow motion. His newly gained confidence allows him to take charge of his life and even revenge himself on those what done him wrong. And then, one day, a disconcerted Will Randall wakes up, soaked in blood.Once in a blue full moon, a schlock genre spits out a gem. I happen to think that WOLF is one of the better, smarter entries in werewolf cinema, and I'd even put it up there withAn American Werewolf in London,The Howling (Special Edition)andThe Company of Wolves. I dig WOLF for the various elements which come correct. For a contemporary film, it wallows in this marvelous gothic atmosphere. There are wicked, unexpected flourishes of humor, and even a smattering of social satire, if one presumes that Will Randall's gradual descent from reserved refinement to uninhibited wolfishness is a metaphor for the predatory, in-the-trenches facet of the New York publishing world.It's weird seeing Jack Nicholson in an underdog role, but it's very neat seeing his docile, dumped-on character - whose traits of ""taste and individuality"" suddenly become liabilities in his job - gaining a huge pair and constructing such a ruthless yet elegant get-back. Nicholson submits a layered interpretation, delivering a fascinating study of a cultured man's growing horror as he succumbs to his baser instincts. The fascinating bits all have to do with that part of him which revels in this turn to savagery. While Nicholson does get moments to chew up scenery, for a good part we're treated to a restrained performance, although, having said that, there's a whiff of that devilish Jack just underneath most of the scenes. Casting dude as a lycanthrope is a no-brainer; there's always been something feral about Jack. And, when he chooses, who else can apply a more baleful, wolfish glare?Nicholson is supported by sharp performances by Michelle Pfeiffer (still very much in her babedom, in 1994) as surly heiress and wounded soul Laura Alden, in whom Will Randall finds a kindred spirit, and Christopher Plummer who, as Randall's boss and Laura's father, flaunts just enough equal doses of sophistication, despicability and worldly understanding that he invites this ambivalent, just-on-principles form of dislike. And James Spader rocks. James Spader for a while had cornered the market on those oily backstabbling yuppie parts. This is never more exemplified than in his role of Stewart Swinton, Randall's friend and underling, whose calculated smarm and brand of ""heat and gossip"" contrive to betray Randall in all ways.Having recently reseen WOLF, I'm again startled that the violence is so low-key. The werewolf scenes are understated, the werewolf make-up not as dynamic or viscerally rendered as, say, that in THE HOWLING or AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. WOLF instead relies more on suspense and the sense of horror being evoked thru effective use of lighting and score, thru adroit character study and spot-on acting. The disappointing thing is that WOLF, in its climactic scenes, resorts to a typical werewolf fighty fight.

The opening scene shows Will driving along an isolated strech of snowy road when suddenly a wolf bolts out in front of his car.  The car strikes the wolf, and Will stops to investigate.  The wolf, seemingly dead but very much alive, bites Will on the hand.Will has been demoted in his company; forced to choose between a less desireable position or no job at all.  Stewart Swinton, played by James Spader, has received Will's old position.Meanwhile, Will is undergoing physical changes, such as a heightened sense of smell and hearing, all caused by the wolf's bite.  With his heightened sense of smell, he notices a strange smelling cologne on his wife's clothes.  He then discovers that his wife is having an affair with Stewart.Soon, Will is becoming involved in a new relationship of his own with Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer).  Laura also happens to be the daughter of Raymond Alden, his former boss, played by Christopher Plummer.  As Will and Laura begin to get close, Will begins to show symptoms of being taken over by the spirit of the wolf.  As the moon rises, Will decides to go outside and is soon chasing down deer.  However, the following morning, Will is completely unaware of what happened the night before. He later learns from an old wise man that the wolf grows inside the man until the first full moon, then the wolf consumes him.  Will is given an amulet to wear around his neck to keep the wolf spirits at bay.The realization that he is turning into a wolf finally begins to sink in, and Will handcuffs himself to a radiator in his hotel room to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else.  He's already killed a gang member and he's afraid he may harm Laura, who's become very attracted to him.A police detective comes to Will's room to tell him that his wife has been murdered. Immediately, Will suspects that he did it while under the influence of the wolf.After arriving back at Laura's house, Will is locked in the barn to keep him from hurting anyone else when the moon comes out.  Laura then goes to the police station to give a statement.  When she arrives at the station, Stewart is there, and mysteriously, he's displaying the same wolf traits as Will.  It seems that somehow during an earlier confrontation, Will must have somehow bit Stewart.  Now Stewart, after losing his newly-gained position back to Will, is out for revenge against him.  Which wolf will win?This is an excellent movie.  Jack Nicholson has always been one of my favorite actors, and he was the perfect choice for this role.  James Spader and Michelle Pfeiffer are captivating as well.  Notice Michelle's yellow eyes and heightened sense of smell at the end of the movie.

165596,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0800177029,Lawyeraau,"[2, 3]","This is a thinking person's werewolf movie. Well directed by Mike Nichols, it features a stellar cast who give excellent performances. Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Plummer, James Spader, Kate Nelligan, and David Hyde Pierce all contribute to the successful execution of this sophisticated and subtle horror film. As an added bonus, those of you who are devotees of the TV series, ""Friends"", should look for David Schwimmer's cameo appearance in the film.Jack Nicholson plays a middle aged, married, senior book editor for a publishing company. Driving home at night from a business trip in New England, he hits an animal on the road. When he gets out of his car to check on the condition of the animal, he discovers it to be a wolf. What happens next will change the course of his life forever.When Jack gets back to his office, he is feeling the after effects of his interaction with the wolf. He is also concerned about his job, as his publishing house has been taken over by Christopher Plummer. Jack initially plays his character as a somewhat laid back, nice guy, a good man who doesn't see the knife being plunged into his back by his young, ambition driven underling, played with obsequious perfection by James Spader, until it is too late. Publishing is, indeed, a dog eat dog world.Betrayed by his underling who has been given his job, Jack finds himself undergoing a subtle, physical metamorphosis. He no longer needs reading glasses, his hearing is extremely acute, and he has a keen, very keen, sense of smell. It is these enhanced senses that lead him to discover that his wife, well played by Kate Nelligan, has shockingly betrayed his love and devotion, causing him to leave her. It is a betrayal that is to have dire consequences for her.Finding himself more robust and aggressive, literally a new man, Jack goes on the attack and, and with the aid of his loyal underling, played to perfection by David Hyde Pierce, gets his job back. He aggressively asserts himself with Spader and lets him know, in no uncertain terms, who is top dog. There is a memorable scene to this effect. In the process of regaining his life, Jack falls in love with the boss's beautiful daughter, played with gritty charm by Michelle Pfeiffer, and she with him.Still, Jack finds himself battling his inner demons over his change. The transformation of Jack is subtle, and there is very lttle use of special effects to enhance his metamorphosis. Jack is often able to convey to the viewer what he is undergoing with a flick of the eyebrow, a twitch of the nose, a curl of the lips. It is a wonderful piece of acting and a tribute to the power of suggestion.Certain events transpire that make Jack fear that his transformation will result in injury to Michelle. She eventually buys into his fear, misinterpreting certain events that take place. What he and she ultimately discover is that they both, in fact, have a great deal to fear, but that their initial fear was misplaced. Look to a great finale.If you are the type of horror film fan who likes excessive gore, as well as many high tech, special effects, this is not the film for you, as there is very little of that in this film. This is a subtle, multi-layered, symbolic type of horror film that will leave the viewer analyzing what they just saw. It is simply a great werewolf film.",5,TOP DRAWER WEREWOLF FILM...,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,3349,"['thinking', 'person', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'Well', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'stellar', 'cast', 'who', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'James', 'Spader', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'contribute', 'successful', 'execution', 'sophisticated', 'subtle', 'horror', 'film', 'added', 'bonus', 'who', 'are', 'devotees', 'TV', 'series', 'Friends', 'should', 'look', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'film.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'middle', 'aged', 'married', 'senior', 'book', 'editor', 'publishing', 'company', 'Driving', 'home', 'night', 'business', 'trip', 'New', 'England', 'animal', 'road', 'When', 'car', 'check', 'condition', 'animal', 'be', 'wolf', 'What', 'next', 'will', 'change', 'course', 'life', 'forever.When', 'Jack', 'back', 'office', 'feeling', 'effects', 'interaction', 'wolf', 'also', 'concerned', 'job', 'publishing', 'house', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Jack', 'initially', 'character', 'somewhat', 'laid', 'back', 'nice', 'guy', 'good', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'see', 'knife', 'being', 'plunged', 'back', 'young', 'ambition', 'driven', 'underling', 'played', 'obsequious', 'perfection', 'James', 'Spader', 'too', 'late', 'Publishing', 'indeed', 'dog', 'eat', 'dog', 'world.Betrayed', 'underling', 'who', 'been', 'given', 'job', 'Jack', 'undergoing', 'subtle', 'physical', 'metamorphosis', 'no', 'longer', 'reading', 'glasses', 'hearing', 'extremely', 'acute', 'keen', 'very', 'keen', 'sense', 'smell', 'enhanced', 'senses', 'lead', 'discover', 'wife', 'well', 'played', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'shockingly', 'betrayed', 'love', 'devotion', 'causing', 'leave', 'betrayal', 'have', 'dire', 'consequences', 'her.Finding', 'more', 'robust', 'aggressive', 'literally', 'new', 'man', 'Jack', 'attack', 'aid', 'loyal', 'underling', 'played', 'perfection', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'job', 'back', 'aggressively', 'Spader', 'know', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'who', 'top', 'dog', 'memorable', 'scene', 'effect', 'process', 'regaining', 'life', 'Jack', 'love', 'boss', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'played', 'gritty', 'charm', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'him.Still', 'Jack', 'battling', 'inner', 'demons', 'change', 'transformation', 'Jack', 'subtle', 'very', 'lttle', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'enhance', 'metamorphosis', 'Jack', 'often', 'able', 'convey', 'viewer', 'what', 'undergoing', 'flick', 'eyebrow', 'twitch', 'nose', 'curl', 'lips', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'acting', 'tribute', 'power', 'suggestion.Certain', 'events', 'transpire', 'make', 'Jack', 'fear', 'transformation', 'will', 'result', 'injury', 'Michelle', 'eventually', 'fear', 'misinterpreting', 'certain', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'What', 'ultimately', 'discover', 'fact', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'fear', 'initial', 'fear', 'was', 'misplaced', 'Look', 'great', 'finale.If', 'are', 'type', 'horror', 'film', 'fan', 'who', 'excessive', 'gore', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'high', 'tech', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'film', 'subtle', 'multi-layered', 'symbolic', 'type', 'horror', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'analyzing', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'simply', 'great', 'werewolf', 'film']",Wolf

I totally enjoyed this movie!Ok, as a huge horror fan, I liked the setting. A publishing house in the city. Unique and what better place than the corporate world for 'cut-throat' wolf behavior?The beginning is always the same--man gets bit by wolf, man becomes wolf and an ending. So, what makes this different? The storytelling.This movie has interesting visuals that aren't just blood and gore. The viewer is focused on the 'how' and not the 'kill'. Jack is wonderful in his portrayal of a man discovering the wolf inside. Maybe it has always been there?Michelle Pfeiffer plays the intriguing character of the Rich Boss's daughter who is naturally drawn to the man her father despises.It's the details that make this movie. The viewer is in the position of Pfeiffer's character and learns along with her. The story doesn't rely on misgivings but rather on the essence of a wolf.The ending leaves the viewer with  a wolfy grin. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end because it did what all good movies do--let me become part of the movie and left me wanting more.

165611,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,0800177029,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","The theme of werewolves is often used as a symbolism for human emotion. In Ginger Snaps the metaphor was the 'change' for women, in Wolfen it is man's insufferable tendency to take over things and destroy them while playing God, and here it is a fine balance of the corporate world and how men behave more like animals to stay on top.Here we have a rather unusual film simply because it's a werewolf drama more than anything else. Yes, that's right...drama.Will Randall, a man in the publishing world, is driving home late one night when lo and behold, his car strikes down an animal. A conscientious sort, he quickly gets out of his car and goes to make sure the creature is not suffering. Once near, however, it jumps up and gives him a healthy bite, in view of several wolves hidden in the trees surrounding them. Alarmed, freaked out and in pain, Randall quickly saunters back to his car and drives off. Once back at home he tends to the bite but doesn't overdo it, his mind too hectic with trying to climb to the top and stay there at the business.At work things aren't going so well, though, as a corporate ladder type proves to be cut throat. His wife is suspiciously occupied, and Randall begins to notice strange, subtle things about himself. For one thing, his sense of hearing heightens. He begins to hear office gossip and all the good stuff even more clearly, his sense of smell enables him to discover a colleague has been drinking tequila in the morning, and his predatory instinct causes him to pee on a co-workers foot. Not able to find help at the doctors, he seeks the help of an alternative healer, who informs him that he is turning into a genuine wolf.Meanwhile, Randall's character meets Laura Alden, the daughter of the corporate big wig who ends up giving Randall the shaft and replacing him with his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. Cold and offstandish, the two inevitably slowly hit it off, with Alden becoming an aide to Randall in his time of need. Her role is of course a big one, and it's easy to ascertain this just by reading the back cover blurb of the story. A little romance is inevitable, and their relationship certainly proves to be an intriguing one.Plot wise, enough of the old werewolf legend and crutches remain to make it all too familiar; there's  not much that's overly new here in that regard, except for a few instances, such as once the change has taken place, it's done. In human life Randall was a bit of a weakling; his wife chastised him for allowing himself to be put down, and he was blinded by false friendship from the man who ultimately betrayed him. When bitten, though, his stronger and more predatory instincts kick in, causing him to take control of the reigns and come back to the top of his world once again.Jack Nicholson is good in whatever he does; this is a slightly different part for the man who isn't a stranger to the odd in film. His personality just works with horror.. He's a bit stiffer than usual roles he picks, and more restrained, but his acting ability allows for this to be carried off. Pfeiffer is truly gorgeous as Laura. Being the rich and misunderstood beautiful girl, she makes a surprisingly sympathetic ally to Jack's character, Randall, in his time of need. James Spader often plays the villainous roles, so here he fits into the part like a silk glove on a well manicured hand. All acting is fine and top notch, as this is a top cast horror film, and of course this adds to the overall experience.Ennio Morricone's score is nearly Hitchcock like, fitting beautifully with the piece. The direction by Mike Nichols is artful, skillful, and visually pleasing. Being careful to choose films that suit his style (He also did the memorable Graduate), he's an underrated gem. Quick and slow zooms are used often, and the cinematography is an ideal match for this type of film. When a werewolf is shown, the make up job is excellent, portraying a realistic type of werewolf and not some supernaturally overcome creature.Where this film excels is in its more adult and modern approach to the lycanthrope legend. It's learned that the change is inevitable and that things can be a blessing if you give them a chance and make the best of the situation; that's its survival of the fittest and that additional, needed strength is never a bad thing. The interaction between Pfeiffer and Nicholson's character is intriguing, and their rocky romance is a thing to be reckoned with. This includes Randall's dealings with his boss and forcing his way to the top by making be a hard ass and taking back his dignity. All heart warming stuff that works somehow with the werewolf story.Flaws are present too, of course. At times the movies pace is arduously slow, moving along at a near boring pace. If you want excitement, you have to look out for it. The fight scenes are minimal, nearly no blood or gore and violence is shown, and if you're a werewolf fan who looks forward to graphic changes, you'd better look elsewhere. Traditional werewolf happenings are amiss, although if you do crave excitement the only scene is a sad one with a deer. How I'd rather see people slaughtered instead! Tension and suspense aren't high, and there is absolutely no scare factor present. What IS interesting is psychological tension between the characters, shown more in verbal exchanges over the usual physical.Overall it's an intriguing enough film that's fun to watch for Nicholson and Pfeiffer's performance. It's slower and almost not horror at all with its lack of attempted scare and suspense. There's virtually no violence, and if you're watching it's more for mind banter and subtle changes. Still worth a view but hardly a classic in the genre.",3,Okay,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,5703,"['theme', 'werewolves', 'often', 'used', 'symbolism', 'human', 'emotion', 'Ginger', 'Snaps',

Now depending how well and how much you take your werewolf mythology, I find 'Wolf' to be a great watch every time I get to see it.  You can never go wrong with this movie's all-star cast and unique storytelling, film-making that reminds me a lot of a classic Stephen King picture.  Jack Nicholson performance is well oiled, and does a fairly good job as the subhuman being. Jack's Eastwick co-star Michelle Pfeiffer rejoins him as a aloof and loveless woman who has manages to open her heart to the character and you can definitely see their Eastwick chemistry is not lost. The only thing that misses the mark slightly about the movie is Laura's  brother.  It is explained a little that he was a borderline schizophrenic and committed suicide.

He has a good head on his shoulders untill after driving home one night from a business trip changes his whole life forever. That's all I am going to tell you for now.

He gets the `shot in the arm' needed to fight back against the twin evils of rampant capitalism and cuckolding prot&eacute;g&eacute; Spader, who has more than an eye on Nicholson's wife, Nelligan, and his mentor's job, from an 'obliging' wolf, when travelling back from a business trip through the frozen wilds of a New England winter.  When asked to visit Plummer, ostensibly to be offered a `sideways' move but, in reality, a lower prestige job, he encounters Plummer's slightly wayward daughter, Pfeiffer, who plays her spoilt little rich girl part to perfection and who, initially at any rate, is only too willing to ally herself to Nicholson as a way of spiting her presumably negligent father.There are, too, turns by stalwart Brit actors, Prunella Scales and Eileen Atkins and Frazier's David Hyde Pierce.

165629,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0800177029,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Released during the early summer of 1994, ""Wolf"" is an interesting werewolf tale about a an aging editor-in-chief of a publishing house in New York City -- Will Randall, played by Jack Nicholson. He gets bit by a wolf on the way back from Vermont and starts experiencing strange changes. Meanwhile he loses his high position in the company and is replaced by his ambitious prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Stewart (James Spader). And problems with his wife (Kate Nelligan) make him ripe for the affections of Laura Alden (Michele Peiffer), who's the daughter of the new owner of the publishing house (Christopher Plummer).As you can see, ""Wolf"" takes the werewolf legend and places it in modern New York, so don't expect the more Gothic ambiance of werewolf films like ""Wolfman"", ""Curse of the Werewolf"" or ""Red Riding Hood"". Also, don't expect the grotesque transformations of those films and others, like ""An American Werewolf in London"" and ""The Howling"" because ""Wolf"" plays that down. Yet this is still very much a werewolf yarn with the horror elements associated with it.The film adds a new twist to the werewolf legend: The bite of the wolf affects the person differently, depending on whether they're good or evil. As such, Will Randall's changes are positive for the most part. Even a certain horrific incident isn't actually a bad thing if you reflect on it (the clash in central park). Another character is infected by the curse and the changes are much different.""Wolf"" works so well because of its emphasis on character. This is not a mindless horror flick; it's a drama with horror touches. Will is a worthy protagonist in which the common man can relate. You can't help but root for him and this shows the difference between ""Wolf"" and most other werewolf flicks: The werewolf is the protagonist. This has been done before, of course -- for example, ""Howling VI: The Freaks"" (which is a quality installment in that non-series) -- ""Wolf"" just ups the ante in this regard.Michele is effective in her role and she certainly has a striking face, but she never tripped my trigger as far as allurement goes. She's just not curvy enough for my tastes. Still, she's very good in the role.James Spader's character is sort of puzzling. In some ways he's likable and seems to show some character, but he keeps contradicting this.Sometimes I couldn't help smirking at some of the werewolf antics, but -- hey -- it's a werewolf film, not ""Terms of Endearment"".FINAL ANALYSIS: Yes, ""Wolf"" is a worthy addition to the werewolf genre, but it takes the subtle route and focuses on story & characters above the typical horror trappings, which is good or bad depending on what you're in the mood for. As for me, I like it.The film runs 125 minutes.GRADE: B+",4,Less is more,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,2744,"['Released', 'early', 'summer', '1994', 'Wolf', 'interesting', 'werewolf', 'tale', 'aging', 'editor-in-chief', 'publishing', 'house', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Will', 'Randall', 'played', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'bit', 'wolf', 'way', 'back', 'Vermont', 'experiencing', 'strange', 'changes', 'Meanwhile', 'high', 'position', 'company', 'replaced', 'ambitious', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Stewart', 'James', 'Spader', 'problems', 'wife', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'make', 'ripe', 'affections', 'Laura', 'Alden', 'Michele', 'Peiffer', 'who', 'daughter', 'new', 'owner', 'publishing', 'house', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'can', 'see', 'Wolf', 'werewolf', 'legend', 'places', 'modern', 'New', 'York', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'more', 'Gothic', 'ambiance', 'werewolf', 'films', 'Wolfman', 'Curse', 'Werewolf', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'grotesque', 'transformations', 'films', 'others', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'Howling', 'Wolf', 'down', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'werewolf', 'yarn', 'horror', 'elements', 'associated', 'it.The', 'film', 'new', 'twist', 'werewolf', 'legend', 'bite', 'wolf', 'person', 'differently', 'depending', ""'re"", 'good', 'evil', 'such', 'Will', 'Randall', 'changes', 'are', 'positive', 'most', 'part', 'Even', 'certain', 'horrific', 'incident', ""n't"", 'actually', 'bad', 'thing', 'reflect', 'clash', 'central', 'park', 'character', 'infected', 'curse', 'changes', 'are', 'much', 'different', 'Wolf', 'so', 'well', 'emphasis', 'character', 'not', 'mindless', 'horror', 'flick', 'drama', 'horror', 'touches', 'Will', 'worthy', 'protagonist', 'common', 'man', 'can', 'relate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'difference', 'Wolf', 'most', 'other', 'werewolf', 'flicks', 'werewolf', 'protagonist', 'been', 'done', 'course', 'example', 'Howling', 'VI', 'Freaks', 'quality', 'installment', 'non-series', 'Wolf', 'just', 'ante', 'regard.Michele', 'effective', 'role', 'certainly', 'striking', 'face', 'never', 'tripped', 'trigger', 'as', 'far', 'allurement', 'just', 'not', 'curvy', 'enough', 'tastes', 'Still', 'very', 'good', 'role.James', 'Spader', 'character', 'sort', 'puzzling', 'ways', 'likable', 'show', 'character', 'contradicting', 'this.Sometimes', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'smirking', 'werewolf', 'antics', 'hey', 'werewolf', 'film', 'not', 'Terms', 'Endearment', '.FINAL', 'ANALYSIS', 'Yes', 'Wolf', 'worthy', 'addition', 'werewolf', 'genre', 'subtle', 'route', 'focuses', 'story', 'characters', 'typical', 'horror', 'trappings', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'what', ""'re"", 'mood', 'like', 'it.The', 'film', '125', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B+']",Wolf
