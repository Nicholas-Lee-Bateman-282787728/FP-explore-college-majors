1692512,A9CHQYIX61N1T,B00HW3EI3I,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Megawatt director, writer and producer Tyler Perry continues to have a tremendously successful career in stage plays, film, and television shows.  More recently, Tyler Perry collaborates with Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s OWN Network producing the popular television drama series, The Haves and the Have Nots.  Tyler Perry draws millions of viewers because of relatable storylines.  Whether a renter or homeowner, have you personally experienced the anguish of challenging neighbors?Diehard fans can anticipate heaping portions of gospel music and a playful exchange of joviality in Tyler Perry&#8217;s Madea&#8217;s Neighbors From Hell (The Play).  Known for her sobering wit, Madea is a Southern matriarch with strong opinions on parenting and family values.  Tyler Perry stars as Madea, teaming up again with busy body town gossip Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis, previously seen in TV&#8217;s &#8216;House of Payne&#8217;).  Although the filming of this staged play was in front of a live audience at the Cobb Center for Performing Arts in Atlanta, GA, the camera angles were focused solely on the stage.  Tyler Perry fans will once again enjoy the spirited music and the capable performers who sing with zeal and conviction.  The lyrics are meaningful and easy to follow along as the story develops.At first glance, the new neighbors residing next door to Aunt Bam, appear to be an intact family. The foster mother, Ruth, is played by actress Rhonda Davis.  Ruth purports to be employed at the local hospital and personifies a friendly demeanor.  According to Aunt Bam, Ruth is polite but the three foster children are unruly and rude. Actor and singer, Wess Morgan (Laugh to Keep From Crying), convincingly plays one of the committed social workers that wants to safeguard the foster children.  Over time, both Aunt Bam and Madea become suspicious from the frequent visits of social workers at the neighbor&#8217;s home.When Madea returns from vacation to discover her home has been unlawfully entered, Madea and Aunt Bam skyrocket into a relentless pursuit of the perpetrators.  In the role of Aunt Bam, Cassi Davis is crafty in her portrayal of passive aggressive behavior.  When the plot abruptly shifts from focusing on the adult characters to unveiling the root problems of the troublesome youth, Madea&#8217;s tough love approach shifts into full throttle.  Eventually, Madea uncovers that the mischievous deeds in the neighborhood are directly linked to Ruth&#8217;s disruptive foster children.In Neighbors From Hell, Tyler Perry inserts zany humor to ease the sting of addressing touchy subjects like abandonment, abuse and dysfunctional relationships.  Occasionally, Tyler Perry will lose character and burst into laughter. One recurring theme in all ofTyler Perry&#8217;s Madea movies is that Madea has an answer for anything and everything.  Buried underneath her tough faade is a caring and concerned heart for all.  While there&#8217;s no guarantee that Madea&#8217;s advice or actions are always right, she saves the day by imparting tidbits of wisdom for the neighbor&#8217;s family crisis.  Tyler Perry fans will undoubtedly get the uplifting comedy they&#8217;ve grown accustomed to.Tyler Perry&#8217;s Madea&#8217;s Neighbors From Hell (The Play) DVD run time is 138 minutes and includes a behind-the-scenes featurette.",3,Madea and Aunt Bam are neighborhood power twins,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,3325,"['Megawatt', 'director', 'writer', 'producer', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'have', 'tremendously', 'successful', 'career', 'stage', 'plays', 'film', 'television', 'shows', 'More', 'recently', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', '8217', 'OWN', 'Network', 'producing', 'popular', 'television', 'drama', 'series', 'Haves', 'Have', 'Nots', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'millions', 'viewers', 'relatable', 'storylines', 'renter', 'homeowner', 'have', 'personally', 'experienced', 'anguish', 'challenging', 'neighbors', 'Diehard', 'fans', 'can', 'anticipate', 'heaping', 'portions', 'gospel', 'music', 'playful', 'exchange', 'joviality', 'Tyler', 'Perry', '8217', 'Madea', '8217', 's', 'Neighbors', 'Hell', 'Play', 'Known', 'sobering', 'wit', 'Madea', 'Southern', 'matriarch', 'strong', 'opinions', 'parenting', 'family', 'values', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Madea', 'teaming', 'up', 'again', 'busy', 'body', 'town', 'gossip', 'Aunt', 'Bam', 'Cassi', 'Davis', 'previously', 'seen', 'TV', '8217', '8216', 'House', 'Payne', '8217', 'filming', 'staged', 'play', 'was', 'front', 'live', 'audience', 'Cobb', 'Center', 'Performing', 'Arts', 'Atlanta', 'GA', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'focused', 'solely', 'stage', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'fans', 'will', 'once', 'again', 'enjoy', 'spirited', 'music', 'capable', 'performers', 'who', 'sing', 'zeal', 'conviction', 'lyrics', 'are', 'meaningful', 'easy', 'follow', 'along', 'story', 'develops.At', 'first', 'glance', 'new', 'neighbors', 'residing', 'next', 'door', 'Aunt', 'Bam', 'appear', 'be', 'intact', 'family', 'foster', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'played', 'actress', 'Rhonda', 'Davis', 'Ruth', 'be', 'employed', 'local', 'hospital', 'friendly', 'demeanor', 'According', 'Aunt', 'Bam', 'Ruth', 'polite', 'three', 'foster', 'children', 'are', 'unruly', 'rude', 'Actor', 'singer', 'Wess', 'Morgan', 'Laugh', 'Keep', 'Crying', 'convincingly', 'one', 'committed', 'social', 'workers', 'safeguard', 'foster', 'children', 'time', 'Aunt', 'Bam', 'Madea', 'become', 'suspicious', 'frequent', 'visits', 'social', 'workers', 'neighbor', '8217', 'home.When', 'Madea', 'returns', 'vacation', 'discover', 'home', 'been', 'unlawfully', 'entered', 'Madea', 'Aunt', 'Bam', 'skyrocket', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'perpetrators', 'role', 'Aunt', 'Bam', 'Cassi', 'Davis', 'crafty', 'portrayal', 'passive', 'aggressive', 'behavior', 'When', 'plot', 'abruptly', 'shifts', 'focusing', 'adult', 'characters', 'unveiling', 'root', 'problems', 'troublesome', 'youth', 'Madea', '8217', 'tough', 'love', 'approach', 'shifts', 'full', 'throttle', 'Eventually', 'Madea', 'mischievous', 'deeds', 'neighborhood', 'are', 'directly', 'linked', 'Ruth', '8217', 'disruptive', 'foster', 'children.In', 'Neighbors', 'From', 'Hell', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'zany', 'humor', 'ease', 'sting', 'addressing', 'touchy', 'subjects', 'abandonment', 'abuse', 'dysfunctional', 'relationships', 'Occasionally', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'will', 'lose', 'character', 'burst', 'laughter', 'One', 'recurring', 'theme', 'ofTyler', 'Perry', '8217', 'Madea', 'movies', 'Madea', 'answer', 'anything', 'everything', 'Buried', 'tough', 'faade', 'caring', 'concerned', 'heart', '8217', 'guarantee', 'Madea', '8217', 's', 'advice', 'actions', 'are', 'always', 'right', 'day', 'imparting', 'tidbits', 'wisdom', 'neighbor', '8217', 'family', 'crisis', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'fans', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'get', 'uplifting', 'comedy', '8217', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'to.Tyler', 'Perry', '8217', 'Madea', '8217', 's', 'Neighbors', 'Hell', 'Play', 'DVD', 'run', 'time', '138', 'minutes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette']",Tyler Perry's Madea's Neighbors From Hell
