I was dubious about the ability of an American actor to interpret the role with the same panache, but I give Jose Ferrer great marks for the sensitivity with which he approaches the role. His reading of the lines is sometimes declamatory, but this is inherent in the text (as in Tirade du Nez) which calls for great flourish in delivery.

379776,A8WRN6S6XGAG9,6303562388,"Brockeim ""Playful Literary Adventurer""","[4, 4]","Jos&eacute; Ferrer is Cyrano de Bergerac. That fact alone is enough to see this version. I say this with the confidence that, until this week, until watching the Hal Roach edition of the 1950 version, G&eacute;rard Depardieu owned the role.In Depardieu's favor was his charm and average or even unattractive appearance. So likable, so gentile, yet not enough. Depardieu was terrific, but he was not as fierce and as bitter as Ferrer in the first part of the movie. Depardieu's obsessive rage was acted, not owned. Ferrer, to the contrary, for me, demonstrated the proper depth of bitterness, insecurity, arrogance, wit, and broken heartedness.The story is simple: an ugly poet/master swordsman (Cyrano) loves a beautiful woman (Roxanne), but is too insecure to tell her. She in turn loves a pretty boy soldier (Christian) who, by his own admission, is void of wit. Christian does not realize Cyrano loves the same woman. Each man uses the other to successfully reach into the woman's heart. She overcomes her shallow view of beauty, but the ugly poet remains diffident and unwilling to risk his heart to her.Jos&eacute; Ferrer is more than the star here. Cyrano's love for Roxanne is truly the story, with no subplots woven in. He capably goes from bold leader to broken man and back again. This puts Ferrer's skill to the test, to engage the audience from scene to scene, emotion to emotion.When he fights dozens of men to protect the baker, I believe it. Unlike many great swashbuckling movies, the choreograph is not fluid. It appears chaotic, like a street fight would be.This movie, Cyrano de Bergerac, is left open to criticism, like that so much was filmed on a stage. We see painted backdrops instead of a genuine wartime sky. Outside of a cane and slow steps, no one seemed older in the final garden scenes. The costuming is impressive, but, beyond that spectacular nose, the makeup is not. That could all be easily improved.Mala Powers as Roxanne worked well enough, though vacuously. I saw her as shallow yet stunningly beautiful from beginning to end. A better actress may have been found as some scenes she played as more of a place keeper than love interest.It is easy to feel for Christian, played by William Prince. Though he is lacking Cyrano's wit, his passion is real. He is brave and bright, but not when it comes to poetry. His sword is mightier than his pen, but he makes no pretense and asks Cyrano for help.A few production value concerns do not hold back the movie, but they do exist. However, with the consuming power of Academy Award winning actor Jos&eacute; Ferrer as the focal point, Cyrano de Bergerac receives top marks from me.--Brockeim",5,A Magnificent Jos&eacute; Ferrer Makes This Cyrano a Classic,1295395200,"01 19, 2011",2011,2670,"['Jos', 'eacute', 'Ferrer', 'Cyrano', 'Bergerac', 'fact', 'alone', 'enough', 'see', 'version', 'say', 'confidence', 'week', 'watching', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'edition', '1950', 'version', 'G', 'eacute', 'Depardieu', 'owned', 'role.In', 'Depardieu', 'favor', 'was', 'charm', 'average', 'even', 'unattractive', 'appearance', 'So', 'likable', 'so', 'gentile', 'yet', 'not', 'enough', 'Depardieu', 'was', 'terrific', 'was', 'not', 'fierce', 'as', 'bitter', 'Ferrer', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'Depardieu', 'obsessive', 'rage', 'was', 'acted', 'not', 'owned', 'Ferrer', 'contrary', 'demonstrated', 'proper', 'depth', 'bitterness', 'insecurity', 'arrogance', 'wit', 'broken', 'heartedness.The', 'story', 'simple', 'ugly', 'poet/master', 'swordsman', 'Cyrano', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Roxanne', 'too', 'insecure', 'tell', 'turn', 'pretty', 'boy', 'soldier', 'Christian', 'who', 'own', 'admission', 'void', 'wit', 'Christian', 'not', 'realize', 'Cyrano', 'same', 'woman', 'man', 'other', 'successfully', 'reach', 'woman', 'heart', 'shallow', 'view', 'beauty', 'ugly', 'poet', 'diffident', 'unwilling', 'risk', 'heart', 'her.Jos', 'eacute', 'Ferrer', 'more', 'star', 'here', 'Cyrano', 'love', 'Roxanne', 'truly', 'story', 'subplots', 'woven', 'capably', 'bold', 'leader', 'broken', 'man', 'back', 'again', 'Ferrer', 'skill', 'test', 'engage', 'audience', 'scene', 'scene', 'emotion', 'emotion.When', 'dozens', 'men', 'protect', 'baker', 'believe', 'many', 'great', 'swashbuckling', 'movies', 'choreograph', 'not', 'fluid', 'chaotic', 'street', 'fight', 'would', 'be.This', 'movie', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'left', 'open', 'criticism', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'filmed', 'stage', 'see', 'painted', 'backdrops', 'instead', 'genuine', 'wartime', 'sky', 'cane', 'slow', 'steps', 'one', 'seemed', 'older', 'final', 'garden', 'scenes', 'costuming', 'impressive', 'spectacular', 'nose', 'makeup', 'not', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'easily', 'improved.Mala', 'Powers', 'Roxanne', 'worked', 'well', 'enough', 'vacuously', 'saw', 'shallow', 'yet', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'beginning', 'end', 'better', 'actress', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'scenes', 'played', 'more', 'place', 'keeper', 'love', 'interest.It', 'easy', 'feel', 'Christian', 'played', 'William', 'Prince', 'lacking', 'Cyrano', 'wit', 'passion', 'real', 'brave', 'bright', 'not', 'when', 'poetry', 'sword', 'mightier', 'pen', 'pretense', 'Cyrano', 'help.A', 'few', 'production', 'value', 'concerns', 'do', 'not', 'hold', 'back', 'movie', 'do', 'exist', 'However', 'consuming', 'power', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'actor', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Ferrer', 'focal', 'point', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'top', 'marks', 'me.', 'Brockeim']",N/A

Cyrano's one insecurity is something he can do little about, his rather large nose, and this seems to make him reluctant to profess his love for a woman he desperately is in love with, Roxane. Roxane, however, has her love already set on another man (Christian) who has the looks that Cyrano has no hope of competing with.In a classic story of lost love, and inner and outer beauty, the film Cyrano de Bergerac seems to highlight the idea that physical attraction can only go so far, and that sacrifice is a huge part of love. There is a significant point in the film when both major characters--Cyrano and Christian--have to sacrifice something. Christian's sacrifice in battle is parallel with Cyrano's sacrifice in trying to help Christian win the love of Roxane, and these sacrifices seem to underscore the various meanings of love in the film. While Roxane loves Christian for his outer handsomeness, it is the voice and words of Cyrano, unbeknownst to her, that she falls in love with. This seems to highlight the notion that physical attraction can only work so much magic before it falls flat, that there has to be something deeper.Another interesting perspective is the two types of battles raging: both physical and emotional. The physical war that Cyrano and Christian fight in seems to coincide with the emotional battle within both of their hearts for Roxane. These seem to equate with both characters different kinds of wounds suffered: Cyrano (emotional, from the idea of not gaining Roxane's love) and Christian (physical, from being hurt in battle).Clearly a sense of honor is there for Cyrano, and this makes the final climactic scene with Roxane perhaps the best scene in the film.This is well-performed classic, albeit overlooked, shows that love has more than one dimension.",4,Tale of Two Loves,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,1991,"['Beauty', 'eye', 'beholder', 'maybe', 'ear', 'beholder.Jose', 'Ferrer', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'witty', 'chivalrous', 'swordsman', 'who', 'flair', 'quick', 'quips', 'romantics', 'Cyrano', 'one', 'insecurity', 'something', 'can', 'do', 'little', 'rather', 'large', 'nose', 'make', 'reluctant', 'profess', 'love', 'woman', 'desperately', 'love', 'Roxane', 'Roxane', 'however', 'love', 'already', 'set', 'man', 'Christian', 'who', 'looks', 'Cyrano', 'hope', 'competing', 'with.In', 'classic', 'story', 'lost', 'love', 'inner', 'outer', 'beauty', 'film', 'Cyrano', 'Bergerac', 'highlight', 'idea', 'physical', 'attraction', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'sacrifice', 'huge', 'part', 'love', 'significant', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'major', 'characters', 'Cyrano', 'Christian', 'have', 'sacrifice', 'something', 'Christian', 'sacrifice', 'battle', 'parallel', 'Cyrano', 'sacrifice', 'trying', 'help', 'Christian', 'win', 'love', 'Roxane', 'sacrifices', 'seem', 'underscore', 'various', 'meanings', 'love', 'film', 'Roxane', 'Christian', 'outer', 'handsomeness', 'voice', 'words', 'Cyrano', 'unbeknownst', 'love', 'highlight', 'notion', 'physical', 'attraction', 'can', 'only', 'work', 'so', 'much', 'magic', 'flat', 'be', 'something', 'deeper.Another', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'two', 'types', 'battles', 'raging', 'physical', 'emotional', 'physical', 'war', 'Cyrano', 'Christian', 'fight', 'coincide', 'emotional', 'battle', 'hearts', 'Roxane', 'seem', 'equate', 'characters', 'different', 'kinds', 'wounds', 'suffered', 'Cyrano', 'emotional', 'idea', 'not', 'gaining', 'Roxane', 'love', 'Christian', 'physical', 'being', 'hurt', 'battle', '.Clearly', 'sense', 'honor', 'there', 'Cyrano', 'final', 'climactic', 'scene', 'Roxane', 'perhaps', 'best', 'scene', 'film.This', 'well-performed', 'classic', 'overlooked', 'love', 'more', 'one', 'dimension']",N/A

Cyrano is one of the most intimate pages of the romantic literature . Jean Rostand , the famous author sharped an emblematic character blending the passionate love surrounded for a rebel spirit. Cyrano was a rebel with cause in the widest sense of the word.Michael Gordon could adapt into screen this novel giving to  film an extremely and carefuly theatrical approach . Think about the glorius mesage of the work . Forget about your physical aspect ; Cyrano (Gordon and Rappenau) , The huntchback of Notre Dame (Jean Delanoy) and curiuosly The beauty and the beast (Jean Cocteau) meant an artistic triumph in the screen and The elephant man (Lynch) in the early eighties signified for the rest of the world the beauty is the sum of little  details and not only a shinning face .

379792,A1UYUPHN7NOU8F,6303562388,La Belle (The Beauty),"[1, 1]","I noticed that in the really old romantic movies, the actors spoke with poetic eloquence. It goes without saying that older movies have a more romantic feel to them for that reason. Jose Ferrer was a really good actor in his time.Here are some quotes from Cyrano de Bergerac that I really loved: Think of me. Me whom the plainest woman would despise. Me with this nose of mine that marches on before me by a quarter of an hour. Whom should I love? Why of course it must be the woman in the world most beautiful.My life's work has been to prompt others and be forgotten. Remember that night when Christian came to your balcony? That moment sums up my life. While I was below in the shadows, others climbed up to kiss the sweet rose.Take my heart. I shall have it all the more. Plucking the flowers, we but keep the plant in bloom. Thus, do I love thee, my darling.Only believe that unto you my whole heart gives one cry. In writing, writes down more than you receive. Sending you kisses through my fingertips. Lady, oh read my letter with your lips.The words in old romantic movies seem like... just words. However, when they are spoken, when they are acted out you actually see the feeling behind those words. Any woman with a romantic heart would love a man who spoke that way to her.Cyrano is a man who doesn't consider himself to be very handsome. He's in love with a woman named Roxane, but she's in love with Christian. Cyrano decides to help Roxane and Christian get together. Christian isn't very poetic, so Cyrano tells Christian that he will write letters with some of the most lovely poetic descriptions and Christian can give the letters to Roxane. Roxane falls in love with Christian more because, due to the letters, she thinks he's the most romantic person in the world. When Cyrano and Christian were in war against another nation, Roxane goes to the camp where they are staying and tells Christian that she doesn't just love him for his looks, but for his words of love and passion. She said she would love him even if he wasn't handsome. Christian then realizes that it is Cyrano that she loves. So he talks to Cyrano and tells him that he thinks Cyrano should tell Roxane the truth and then she can choose who she wants to be with. Cyrano agrees to tell her the truth, but then Christian dies in battle so Cyrano decides not to tell her. He decided to let her think lovingly of Christian. (That's a big hearted man.) Before Cyrano died after being run over by a carriage, he let Roxane know that it was he who wrote those beautiful words. Roxane let Cyrano read one of the letters that she thought Christian wrote, and he was not only reading it so poetically, he was also reading it word for word by heart, without even looking at the letter and that's how Roxane found out that those letters were written by Cyrano. After that, Cyrano slips into delirium and then dies. (If you're thinking about seeing this movie, you can find more of a plot for it on wikipedia, which probably has a better movie description than what I gave.)I wish that movies nowadays were as poetically romantic as they were long ago. Now I understand why a lot of old actors were totally adored. They had incredible acting skills. There are other versions of this movie, but I haven't seen them yet. The reason I saw this one is because I liked another movie that I saw the star actor in. He was good in this one too. He's not the main reason I liked this one. I mostly liked how it was romantically poetic. The actors certainly do make the movie, especially when they know how to act.",5,Another spectacular performance by Jose Ferrer,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,3578,"['noticed', 'really', 'old', 'romantic', 'movies', 'actors', 'spoke', 'poetic', 'eloquence', 'saying', 'older', 'movies', 'have', 'more', 'romantic', 'feel', 'reason', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'are', 'quotes', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'really', 'loved', 'Think', 'Me', 'whom', 'plainest', 'woman', 'would', 'despise', 'Me', 'nose', 'mine', 'quarter', 'hour', 'Whom', 'should', 'love', 'Why', 'course', 'must', 'be', 'woman', 'world', 'most', 'beautiful.My', 'life', 'work', 'been', 'prompt', 'others', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Remember', 'night', 'when', 'Christian', 'came', 'balcony', 'moment', 'sums', 'up', 'life', 'was', 'shadows', 'others', 'climbed', 'kiss', 'sweet', 'rose.Take', 'heart', 'shall', 'have', 'more', 'Plucking', 'flowers', 'keep', 'plant', 'bloom', 'Thus', 'do', 'love', 'thee', 'darling.Only', 'believe', 'whole', 'heart', 'one', 'cry', 'writing', 'down', 'more', 'receive', 'Sending', 'kisses', 'fingertips', 'Lady', 'oh', 'read', 'letter', 'lips.The', 'words', 'old', 'romantic', 'movies', 'seem', 'just', 'words', 'However', 'when', 'are', 'spoken', 'when', 'are', 'acted', 'actually', 'see', 'feeling', 'words', 'woman', 'romantic', 'heart', 'would', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'spoke', 'way', 'her.Cyrano', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'consider', 'be', 'very', 'handsome', 'love', 'woman', 'named', 'Roxane', 'love', 'Christian', 'Cyrano', 'help', 'Roxane', 'Christian', 'get', 'together', 'Christian', ""n't"", 'very', 'poetic', 'so', 'Cyrano', 'tells', 'Christian', 'will', 'write', 'letters', 'most', 'lovely', 'poetic', 'descriptions', 'Christian', 'can', 'give', 'letters', 'Roxane', 'Roxane', 'love', 'Christian', 'more', 'because', 'due', 'letters', 'most', 'romantic', 'person', 'world', 'When', 'Cyrano', 'Christian', 'were', 'war', 'nation', 'Roxane', 'camp', 'where', 'are', 'staying', 'tells', 'Christian', ""n't"", 'just', 'love', 'looks', 'words', 'love', 'passion', 'said', 'would', 'love', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'handsome', 'Christian', 'then', 'Cyrano', 'Cyrano', 'Cyrano', 'should', 'tell', 'Roxane', 'truth', 'then', 'can', 'choose', 'who', 'be', 'Cyrano', 'tell', 'truth', 'then', 'Christian', 'battle', 'so', 'Cyrano', 'not', 'tell', 'decided', 'let', 'think', 'lovingly', 'Christian', 'big', 'hearted', 'man', 'Cyrano', 'died', 'being', 'run', 'over', 'carriage', 'let', 'Roxane', 'know', 'was', 'who', 'wrote', 'beautiful', 'words', 'Roxane', 'let', 'Cyrano', 'read', 'one', 'letters', 'thought', 'Christian', 'wrote', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'reading', 'so', 'poetically', 'was', 'also', 'reading', 'word', 'word', 'heart', 'even', 'looking', 'letter', 'how', 'Roxane', 'found', 'out', 'letters', 'were', 'written', 'Cyrano', 'Cyrano', 'delirium', 'then', 'dies', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'seeing', 'movie', 'can', 'find', 'more', 'plot', 'wikipedia', 'probably', 'better', 'movie', 'description', 'what', 'gave', 'wish', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'were', 'poetically', 'romantic', 'were', 'long', 'ago', 'Now', 'understand', 'why', 'lot', 'old', 'actors', 'were', 'totally', 'adored', 'had', 'incredible', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'other', 'versions', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'reason', 'saw', 'one', 'liked', 'movie', 'saw', 'star', 'actor', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'too', 'not', 'main', 'reason', 'liked', 'one', 'mostly', 'liked', 'how', 'was', 'romantically', 'poetic', 'actors', 'certainly', 'do', 'make', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'know', 'how', 'act']",N/A

Worst of all, the actors sound as though their heads are being held underwater and the violins on the soundtrack are similarly submerged.This is lovely, literate film, with several average performances and one astonishing, Academy-Award-winning performance by Jose Ferrer.  His portrayal of Cyrano might well be the greatest of all time, even when it sounds like it is spoken from inside my fish tank.

Cyrano to me was the very picture of what this time period is like, this is the version that I love more than all others. I was in my local Half Price Books when I saw the book, I picked it up and was thumbing through it when I realized that the DVD of the Jose Ferrar version was attached all for $5.98, joy.  I have seen every version of Cyrano, even the Steve Martin take on it in Roxanne.  Jose's tenderness and beauty in this part is something that I must admit that I have read some of the reviews and they say that it doesn't seem realistic to them.  There was a time when men actually courted women with sweet words and kindness, when being a poet was something that you were praised for.  I suppose that there will be people who think that there is something fantasy like in this character but I also know that he is based on a real poet living at the time that it was written.  I find that it was something that endeared the character to me.  I love Cyrano, he taught me at a young age that it is important to look beyond someone's features and see who they are.  I am like the young woman who offered him a feast at the beginning of the movie, my eyes would have held no mocking in them.  Jose Ferrer is amazing in this part, this is the one that I looked for and when I found it that Sunday afternoon, I ran to watch it because it had been my one true search for so long.

379796,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6303562388,Martin Asiner,"[6, 8]","In CYRANO DE BERGERAC, director Michael Gordon took the play by Edmond Rostand and kept the original theme that it was only the man who had a mastery of both words and action who could achieve greatness.  Jose Ferrer plays Cyrano as a man who wears a mask of courage and speech to hide an inner self who suffers from a lifetime of hurt because of his outsized nose.  He has an infinity of patience to bear his own pain, but none at all for the pain of the woman whom he loves from afar.  Mala Powers plays Roxanne, Cyrano's love interest, as a beautiful, yet one-dimensional heroine who is obtuse enough not to see the depths of Cyrano's love for her but thinks she can see herself love the handsome but verbally challenged Christian.  This movie is a set piece of scenes, each of which places Cyrano at center stage, either seeking glory with wit or word or unselfishly trying to connect the clueless Roxanne with an equally clueless Christian, who cannot perceive why Cyrano would help him win Roxanne.Much of the charm of the movie rests squarely on the shoulders of Jose Ferrer, who starts the movie with a wonderful sequence of dueling set to verse.  As Cyrano hits the final refrain to the poem, he stabs his overmatched opponent, with the audience of the theater in the film and the audience watching the video loudly applauding. It is this twin level of applauding from both audiences that Cyrano clearly needs as much as he needs Roxanne.  He hides his pain for nearly the entire film.  It is only at the end that he removes the mask so that Roxanne can see the mixture of courage and fear that has driven Cyrano from childhood.  Cyrano, at the end, is old, malnourished, and suffering from a head wound, all of which he hides from a still dense Roxanne, who still cherishes the memory of Christian, who died fifteen years earlier in heroic battle.  All Roxanne can see is a Cyrano who has been her faithful companion for all those years, never asking for anything in return.  All Cyrano can see is a woman whose own delusions are more important for him to maintain than it is for her.  Yet as Cyrano reads her the gossip of the court, Roxanne cannot but help notice his atypical hesitation of movement and slurring of speech.  Too late, she guesses the truth, which he denies even until the last.  Cyrano dies on his feet, dueling with a lifetime of foes who dance before his faltering gaze.  Roxanne knows with his death who Cyrano really was.CYRANO DE BERGERAC is a mixture of exciting adventure mixed with some basic questions as to why some people are attracted to this person, but not another.  The movie does not directly answer these questions, but it does imply that beneath the exteriors of handsome features often beats a heart not unlike that of one who must confront society with sword and verse only because of a nose.",5,Cyrano: A Man of Words and Action,1025740800,"07 4, 2002",2002,2841,"['CYRANO', 'DE', 'BERGERAC', 'director', 'Michael', 'Gordon', 'took', 'play', 'Edmond', 'Rostand', 'kept', 'original', 'theme', 'was', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'mastery', 'words', 'action', 'who', 'could', 'achieve', 'greatness', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'Cyrano', 'man', 'who', 'mask', 'courage', 'speech', 'hide', 'inner', 'self', 'who', 'lifetime', 'hurt', 'outsized', 'nose', 'infinity', 'patience', 'bear', 'own', 'pain', 'none', 'pain', 'woman', 'whom', 'afar', 'Mala', 'Powers', 'Roxanne', 'Cyrano', 'love', 'interest', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'one-dimensional', 'heroine', 'who', 'obtuse', 'enough', 'not', 'see', 'depths', 'Cyrano', 'love', 'can', 'see', 'love', 'handsome', 'verbally', 'challenged', 'Christian', 'movie', 'set', 'piece', 'scenes', 'places', 'Cyrano', 'center', 'stage', 'seeking', 'glory', 'wit', 'word', 'unselfishly', 'trying', 'connect', 'clueless', 'Roxanne', 'equally', 'clueless', 'Christian', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'perceive', 'why', 'Cyrano', 'would', 'help', 'win', 'Roxanne.Much', 'charm', 'movie', 'squarely', 'shoulders', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'who', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'sequence', 'dueling', 'set', 'verse', 'Cyrano', 'final', 'refrain', 'poem', 'stabs', 'overmatched', 'opponent', 'audience', 'theater', 'film', 'audience', 'watching', 'video', 'loudly', 'applauding', 'twin', 'level', 'applauding', 'audiences', 'Cyrano', 'clearly', 'as', 'much', 'Roxanne', 'pain', 'nearly', 'entire', 'film', 'only', 'end', 'mask', 'Roxanne', 'can', 'see', 'mixture', 'courage', 'fear', 'driven', 'Cyrano', 'childhood', 'Cyrano', 'end', 'old', 'malnourished', 'suffering', 'head', 'wound', 'still', 'dense', 'Roxanne', 'who', 'still', 'memory', 'Christian', 'who', 'died', 'fifteen', 'years', 'earlier', 'heroic', 'battle', 'Roxanne', 'can', 'see', 'Cyrano', 'who', 'been', 'faithful', 'companion', 'years', 'never', 'asking', 'anything', 'return', 'Cyrano', 'can', 'see', 'woman', 'own', 'delusions', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'maintain', 'Cyrano', 'gossip', 'court', 'Roxanne', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'notice', 'atypical', 'hesitation', 'movement', 'slurring', 'speech', 'Too', 'late', 'truth', 'even', 'last', 'Cyrano', 'feet', 'dueling', 'lifetime', 'foes', 'who', 'dance', 'faltering', 'gaze', 'Roxanne', 'death', 'who', 'Cyrano', 'really', 'DE', 'BERGERAC', 'mixture', 'exciting', 'adventure', 'mixed', 'basic', 'questions', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'attracted', 'person', 'not', 'movie', 'not', 'directly', 'questions', 'imply', 'beneath', 'exteriors', 'handsome', 'features', 'often', 'heart', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'must', 'confront', 'society', 'sword', 'verse', 'only', 'nose']",N/A

According to his cousin, Roxane (Mala Powers), Cyrano is a ""soldier, poet, philosopher, musician, playwright, and best swordsman in Paris.""  Unknown to Roxane, he is also in love with her.  Cyrano is afraid she will reject him because of his very long nose.Roxane confides in Cyrano that she's in love with a young soldier named Christian (William Prince).  Christian is also in love with her but he has one major flaw: he is romantically inept and can't express his love.Thus Christian enlists the help of Cyrano (or more precisely Cyrano's words) to woo Roxane.  It is from this point on that the fun begins.The words used throughout this movie especially by Cyrano are in a word -- beautiful.  Even though this movie is in black and white, the words used are very colorful.  It's strange but the black and white actually enhances the colorful words that are used.All the sword dueling is finely choreographed and so very authentic looking.  The background music enhances all scenes in this movie.  All costumes are so authentic-looking that they add to each actor's performance.All acting is superb but Jose Ferrer as Cyrano steals the show.  It is easy to see why he won an Oscar for this role.Finally, this DVD by ""Image Entertainment"" is of good quality.  I have seen this movie on other less-expensive DVDs and both the picture and sound quality suffer.  If you do not want distracting artifacts and want to see a classic play that's well acted, then this is the DVD to get!In conclusion, this is a classic, swashbuckling movie.  Be sure to view this movie and see why ""a great [long] nose indicates a great man!""(1950;  black and white;  115 min; full screen)+++++",5,Black and White Movie with Colorful Language,1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,1914,"['+++++', 'Note', 'review', 'DVD', 'released', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'May', '2004', 'movie', 'based', 'French', 'playwright', 'Edmond', 'Rostand', 'play', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', '1897', '.This', 'movie', 'long-nosed', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'According', 'cousin', 'Roxane', 'Mala', 'Powers', 'Cyrano', 'soldier', 'poet', 'philosopher', 'musician', 'playwright', 'best', 'swordsman', 'Paris', 'Roxane', 'also', 'love', 'Cyrano', 'afraid', 'will', 'reject', 'very', 'long', 'nose.Roxane', 'confides', 'Cyrano', 'love', 'young', 'soldier', 'named', 'Christian', 'William', 'Prince', 'Christian', 'also', 'love', 'one', 'major', 'flaw', 'romantically', 'inept', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'love.Thus', 'Christian', 'help', 'Cyrano', 'more', 'precisely', 'Cyrano', 'words', 'woo', 'Roxane', 'point', 'fun', 'begins.The', 'words', 'used', 'movie', 'especially', 'Cyrano', 'are', 'word', 'beautiful', 'Even', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'words', 'used', 'are', 'very', 'colorful', 'strange', 'black', 'white', 'actually', 'colorful', 'words', 'are', 'sword', 'dueling', 'finely', 'choreographed', 'so', 'very', 'authentic', 'looking', 'background', 'music', 'scenes', 'movie', 'costumes', 'are', 'so', 'authentic-looking', 'add', 'actor', 'performance.All', 'acting', 'superb', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'Cyrano', 'show', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role.Finally', 'DVD', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'good', 'quality', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'other', 'less-expensive', 'DVDs', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'suffer', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'distracting', 'artifacts', 'want', 'see', 'classic', 'play', 'well', 'acted', 'then', 'DVD', 'get', 'conclusion', 'classic', 'swashbuckling', 'movie', 'Be', 'sure', 'view', 'movie', 'see', 'why', 'great', '[', 'long', ']', 'nose', 'great', 'man', '1950', 'black', 'white', '115', 'min', 'full', 'screen', '+++++']",N/A

379803,A27FYYS44LH7KD,6303562388,Thucydides 1,"[0, 0]","This review is of a brand new, Hal Roach Studios release (yellow background on cover):Jose Ferrer's performance as Cyrano is exceptional, of course, but I was surprised at the relatively poor quality of the transfer, given all the reviews I've read about how the Hal Roach release is, by far, the best!  It may be the best, and if so, then I pity anyone who buys a DVD version of &#34;lesser&#34; quality.  The film original must have been in dreadful shape by the time they got around to transferring it to a digital medium.There are all the usual speckles and splotches you see so often in older movies, but it's most irritating in the final scene with Cyrano at the movie's end.  It's as though there was a &#34;wash&#34; of some kind that causes the sky to look like it has been filled with soapy dishwater or something.  Most distracting, just as Ferrer's is giving some of the most poignant, emotional lines.So, by now you've probably read many reviews about how BAD the other versions of the movie are, and they may be -- but don't expect the Hal Roach Studios version to be pristine, because it surely is not.  Not by a long shot!Ferrer is superb, but the directing is a little wooden at times.  Still, the movie adheres closely to the word and spirit of the book.  You'll enjoy Jose Ferrer's performance, which may never be eclipsed, but some of the supporting cast, including Mala Powers as &#34;Roxanne&#34;, are, uh, rather unremarkable.",4,This is the highest quality transfer to DVD?
