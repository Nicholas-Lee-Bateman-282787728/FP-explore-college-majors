There are three sections on this DVD, a beginner/intermediate 25 minute routine, an advanced 45 min routine and a 10 min tutorial (which is so great I wished it was much longer). Before coming across this DVD, I've admired Tara Stiles, read her books, bought her 4 DVD set, and tried to get into more advanced positions with her instructions but I was scared of injury and it just didn't work. With Kathryn Budig it's different. She makes you believe you can do it because her instruction is so doable. She is also very encouraging and when she says ""you're floating, you did it"", I'm like, ""yes, I am!"". The first time I had both feet off the ground, it felt like I was on a cloud. Love this DVD. I wish she had more DVDs (both her DVDs are the same, the newer one is just a re-release, unfortunatly).",5,I just wish she had more DVDs,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,952,"[""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'advanced', 'yoga', 'Kathryn', 'such', 'great', 'instructor', 'will', 'try', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'liberating', 'are', 'three', 'sections', 'DVD', 'beginner/intermediate', '25', 'minute', 'routine', 'advanced', '45', 'min', 'routine', '10', 'min', 'tutorial', 'so', 'great', 'wished', 'was', 'much', 'longer', 'coming', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'admired', 'Tara', 'Stiles', 'read', 'books', 'bought', '4', 'DVD', 'set', 'tried', 'get', 'more', 'advanced', 'positions', 'instructions', 'was', 'scared', 'injury', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Kathryn', 'Budig', 'different', 'believe', 'can', 'do', 'instruction', 'so', 'doable', 'also', 'very', 'encouraging', 'when', ""'re"", 'floating', 'did', ""'m"", 'yes', 'am', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'feet', 'ground', 'felt', 'was', 'cloud', 'Love', 'DVD', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'DVDs', 'DVDs', 'are', 'same', 'newer', 'one', 'just', 're-release', 'unfortunatly']",Aim True Yoga

There is a variety of levels and challenges that you can put yourself to the test to. And once you really get into it and enjoy what you're doing, it becomes a really fun adventure. As a newbie though, I did find it a little hard to understand at first and found myself staring at the screen more than on my poses because the session moves along quickly. But once you grasp the movement and the progression of the movements, it's an awesome DVD. Also has a 10 minute session on more difficult poses which I find myself pursuing as well, such as: the crow, dolphin pose, and yoga handstand.

1427736,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B004TFTE90,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[13, 13]","This DVD is instructed by Kathryn Budig, a frequent model for the magazine YOGA JOURNAL.  Budig explains in the included interview that she was inspired by the Greek Goddess Artemis to come up with the ""Aim True"" theme, and she weaves this theme into both practices.  Budig offers two main yoga routine, a shorter ""Beginner's Flow"" and then a longer ""Authentic Flow"" which she designates as an intermediate practice.  She also provides a brief tutorial called ""Yoga Poses Demystified,"" which breaks down several more advanced postures.  The final items on the Main Menu are the Exclusive Interview with Kathryn (6.5 minutes) and the link for downloads from Gaiam.For each of the two yoga practices as well as the tutorial, Budig is alone in a large studio, instructing via voiceover.  Her only prop for the main routines is a mat, but she does use a yoga block to assist with the postures in the tutorial segment.  I have described each of the practices in detail below.BEGINNER'S (25 minutes)Budig begins this routine in child's pose.  She moves quickly through a few cat's breaths to down dog, providing the option of movement.  From there she moves on to a chaturanga variation, flowing through a vinyasa which includes plank, baby cobra, full cobra, and returning to down dog.  Eventually, she moves into forward bend and then comes to standing for two rounds of sun salutations.  Returning to the floor, Budig moves through some abs work, including boat pose with bent knees, and then flips over for some work on the elbows.  From down dog, she practices hops, hovering in the air.  She then moves through several standing pose flows, including three-legged dog to low lunge; chair to warrior 1; chair to warrior 1, warrior 2, reverse warrior, and side angle pose; and triangle to half fish to dolphin/plank poses.  The finishing poses include bridge, happy baby, and reclining twist.  Budig sets up for savaasana, but no time is allowed for the final rest.  This definitely was NOT a beginner's practice, as Budig offers almost no form and alignment tips, and she moves quite quickly throughout the routine; I would suggest that it is appropriate for those at a low intermediate level and above.AUTHENTIC FLOW (45 minutes)Budig starts this practice in down dog, again allowing for movement in the posture.  After moving through a few vinyasas from chaturanga to plank and back to down dog, she eventually comes to the top of the mat and performs a total of three sun salutations.  This is again followed by abs work:  although she continues to keep the knees bent for boat pose, she also adds several rounds of boat to half-boat.  Returning to down dog, Budig practices the hops with the hover, adding in a clap of the heels as well.  The first standing sequence moves from chair through warrior 1 to side plank and crazy dog.  Budig then holds in a squat, optionally moving into crow pose.  Next comes what she calls the ""archer sequence"""":  she performs warrior 1, warrior 2, reverse warrior, and side angle poses, all while doing a bow and arrow with the arms.  This series ends with standing splits, practicing a hop in this position as well.  The next sequence includes triangle pose with bind, half moon, half fish, and ""Thriller"" push-ups (from half fish, rocking forward onto the hands and pushing up).  This is followed by what Budig calls ""Ninja"" hops, or hopping forward on the tippy toes from down dog position.  The final standing series includes standing hand-to-foot, warrior 3, crescent, and revolved crescent.  Budig then performs dolphin pose, practicing hops from this position (i.e., hoping into forearm balance--note that she does NOT use a wall to assist).  Coming to the floor, Budig performs two rounds of wheel followed by happy babies pose.  Finishing postures include cross-leg reclined twist, full seated forward bend, and double pigeon.  Budig again sets up for savasana but does not allow any time for the actual relaxation.  Although most of this routine was solidly intermediate, Budig moved into the advanced ranges at times with her frequent forays into balancing on the hands.YOGA POSES DEMYSTIFIED (8.5 minutes)There are 4 segments to this section:  1) Block Exercise (Tiny Little Package)--Budig uses a block to discuss keeping the shoulders in alignment, 2) Half Moon Pose--Budig uses a block to assist with achieving this posture, 3) Crow Pose--Budig shows how to learn this posture by squatting on a block, and 4) Headstand--Budig explains how to attain the balance needed for Tripod headstand.Budig has a young, hippy-type vibe, and she IS very encouraging despite the fact that she doesn't provide much form information.  The practices on this DVD would probably be most appropriate for those who are already experienced yoga practitioners but who enjoy playing around with taking things to a more advanced level.  In addition, Budig is likely to appeal most to those who are already fit and flexible.",4,Two vinyasa-based practices for intermediates and above,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,4949,"['DVD',

1427737,A2KXC94HOL85OF,B004TFTE90,C. Horton,"[1, 3]","I am sort of new to yoga, but kinda not new to yoga.  I took a series of intro yoga classes at a studio about a year and a half ago, but for some reason didn't continue with it.  I'm revisiting yoga and wanted to take another series of intro classes, but couldn't find any that fit my schedule.  So I decided to take a chance on this DVD after seeing the positive reviews.(I've only done the beginner's practice, so my review is based on that.  Just an FYI).  If you're looking for breakdowns of poses and notes on form then look elsewhere.  There is a special section where Kathryn shows you how to do some of the more advanced poses like crow and I think forearm stand, but there is no tutorial on basic poses like DFD, chaturanga, and the Warrior poses.  If you're already sort of familiar with basic yoga poses and are just looking to get your body loosened up and used to being in positions like plank and downward facing dog, then Aim True is the DVD for you.  If you enjoy yoga, or think you might enjoy yoga, but sometimes don't really want all that chanting and spiritual talk, Aim True is for you.  Kathryn DOES discuss things like ""letting it all go"" and ""this is a space for you"" which is perfectly fine for me and her personality and humor in the beginner's practice comes off as sweet and endearing.  She encourages you to just try the poses, see how they fit your body.  It's relaxing yet challenging, which is exactly what I was looking for.",5,It's perfect!,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,1457,"['am', 'sort', 'new', 'yoga', 'not', 'new', 'yoga', 'took', 'series', 'intro', 'yoga', 'classes', 'studio', 'year', 'half', 'ago', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'continue', ""'m"", 'revisiting', 'yoga', 'wanted', 'take', 'series', 'intro', 'classes', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'fit', 'schedule', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'positive', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'only', 'done', 'beginner', 'practice', 'review', 'based', 'Just', 'FYI', ""'re"", 'looking', 'breakdowns', 'poses', 'notes', 'form', 'then', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'special', 'section', 'where', 'Kathryn', 'how', 'do', 'more', 'advanced', 'poses', 'crow', 'think', 'forearm', 'stand', 'tutorial', 'basic', 'poses', 'DFD', 'chaturanga', 'Warrior', 'poses', ""'re"", 'already', 'sort', 'familiar', 'basic', 'yoga', 'poses', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'get', 'body', 'loosened', 'up', 'used', 'being', 'positions', 'plank', 'downward', 'facing', 'dog', 'then', 'Aim', 'True', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'yoga', 'think', 'might', 'enjoy', 'yoga', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'chanting', 'spiritual', 'talk', 'Aim', 'True', 'Kathryn', 'DOES', 'discuss', 'things', 'letting', 'go', 'space', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'personality', 'humor', 'beginner', 'practice', 'off', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'just', 'try', 'poses', 'see', 'how', 'fit', 'body', 'relaxing', 'yet', 'challenging', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'looking']",Aim True Yoga

She has good form, explains things well, and the entire experience is both energizing, a little tiring, and calming in one package.  The music is unnoticeable, which for me is huge.  It is fun yoga.  I often get too serious with yoga, and this one is helping me to remember that yoga practice should be fun and that fun does not mean frivolous.To help you make a judgment what my opinion means, let me tell you other yoga dvds I've got and what I think of them:*Rodney Yee - Power Yoga : Okay, a decent yoga work out with a lot of sun salutation*Ana Brett/ Ravi Singh - almost all of theirs, though the last few are (in my opinion) abominable (I'm ducking here for all of the stuff their followers are throwing my way).  I love their middle stuff, which is very similar to their early stuff with MUCH better production values.  The later stuff is like MTV yoga with too much music, too many camera shifts, even her hair style shifts during these sequences, and the background is distracting with the fake water. Something happened when she went blond.*Gurmurkh - Kundalini Yoga with Gurmukh:  I like this.  It is basic, no frills, tiring, fulfilling.*Ashtanga Collection with Richard Freeman:  A lot of this I cannot do.  I can do the first dvd no problem, the second with some challenges, the third I haven't even attempted yet.  I like his peaceful manner, though it took a bit to get used to it because he almost seems zoned out/in at first.  Very thorough explanations help deepen understanding of why and what you're doing.*Short Forms Practice Ashtanga - David Swenson:  I like this, though I am not crazy about the instructor.  I think it is because he reminds me of someone, and though that ideally would not influence my opinion, it seems to.*The Art of Flow Yoga Zuzana Kolinkova - I am not crazy about the way the dvd is set up, the the yoga is very enjoyable, flowing, smooth, and leaves you with a sense of wholeness.*Barkan Method of Hot Yoga :  I really like this.

I have been practicing yoga for 14 years, and when I began I loved sun salutations. The way most yoga is oriented around them and emphasizes coming into them between every pose eventually dampened my enthusiasm.Nonetheless, I was looking for a DVD to help with arm strength, and while this definitely could fit the bill, I really disliked the overall vibe of the disc. The background music borders on muzak, and the routine winds up feeling too rushed, at the expensive of some important stuff. For one, alignment is really given the blow off, and this isn't good as I wound up with a really painful neck after doing the intermediate practice. Second, once you come down into savasana the disc ends and goes into the very unrelaxing menu music. I hate when discs just .. stop when you're doing what's supposed to be one of the most important poses. I did the intermediate workout because 25 minutes is much shorter than I'd like to do. However, I found myself really frustrated. It felt like Kathryn spent the entire routine wishing she was doing handstand, and nudging the rest of us to join her. I didn't feel comfortable doing a lot of these high hops without someone to check my posture (and as I thought- ouch afterwards).I feel like this is the worst kind of American yoga, where the focus is mostly on the same goals as your average gym routine, with a little bit of self-esteem building built in.

My primary focus is, and always will be, Hatha yoga, but I've done everything but Bikram.  Bikram just doesn't appeal to me.  At my age, the last place I want to be is an overheated room.Kathryn is a fresh face, and the product description sounded interesting.  I watched the video before I tried it; I always do that.  I noticed she moves pretty fast; that was a red flag.Of course, watching and doing are still different.  After watching, I started the practice, and I did it a few times.  I found she moves way too fast.  Yes, I can do all these poses, but running through sun salutations so quickly, I had great difficulty maintaining balance.  I know how to modify a routine, so I started skipping some poses to maintain a reasonable pace.  It was a less than satisfying experience.  I play my edge, but I don't practice to feed my ego.Then there's the hopping.  You're in Downward Facing Dog, and she says to jump your feet up in a manner that would resemble kneeling, upside down in mid-air.  I did it.  I didn't see the point, but I did it.  THEN, she says to clap the soles of your feet together while jumping, a move that made me feel like a trained seal.  This business would appeal to me as a game, but not as yoga practice.  And there is no point, except, as Kathryn squeals, to ""have fun!""It sounded like someone was doing jumping jacks in my living room.  This isn't yoga.  It's twisting and tumbling like a five-year-old.In the arrow series, Kathryn instructs you to pretend you're an archer, while you're in Warrior II.  The series is, essentially, variations on Warrior with twists.  For example, she says to pull an ""arrow"" from your ""quiver"" (reach behind your shoulder with your front hand) and aim toward your back leg.  Since you're ""holding your bow"" in your back hand, you do a spinal twist while you're in Warrior.  This series I felt was interesting, and the instructions were very clear.  It is, unfortunately, the only worthy portion of the workout.

1427751,A127MY5UD6ZJM6,B004TFTE90,"R. Goss ""rgoss99""","[0, 0]","I've read most of the reviews regarding Aim True Yoga, and I can honestly see both sides of the story. On the one hand, yes, Kathryn does give you a pretty good workout. It's challenging enough to bring up a sweat, but not so challenging that an intermediate-level yoga practitioner like me can't do it. I also like the way she encourages you to ""dig deeper"" in certain poses and moves, such as when you have to jump your feet to your hands.On the other hand, though, she really does speed through this routine. Her instructions are so brief and moves are so quick that I frequently have to look up to see what she's doing, and by the time I figure it out, she's on to the next move. So the guidance is definitely lacking, as some people have already pointed out. Of course, you can learn a routine by playing the video again and again. But I personally think a teacher should guide her/his students more--and I think that teachers that do this are always respected more by their students.I also sympathize with the people who feel that this is too focused on working out and not so much so on yoga basics. When I do vinyasa yoga, I do like to feel like I've gotten some workout benefit from it. So I'm okay with that part. But I also like the teacher to warm me up well with lots of sun salutations and, by the same token, to use gradual, traditional yoga cool-down techniques to wind things down. You don't really get that sense with Kathryn's workout. It's just go, go, go...done.So my verdict is that if you're looking for a quick, intense vinyasa routine, then you'll probably like this. But if you're a bit more of a traditionalist in terms of your yoga, you're probably not going to enjoy this video so much. Look instead to programs from Shiva Rea, Janet Stone or Sadie Nardini (who in my opinion blend the two worlds of yoga fundamentals and intense vinyasa workout much better).",3,Hit and miss,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,1888,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'reviews', 'regarding', 'Aim', 'True', 'Yoga', 'can', 'honestly', 'see', 'sides', 'story', 'one', 'hand', 'yes', 'Kathryn', 'give', 'pretty', 'good', 'workout', 'challenging', 'enough', 'bring', 'up', 'sweat', 'not', 'so', 'challenging', 'intermediate-level', 'yoga', 'practitioner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'also', 'way', 'dig', 'deeper', 'certain', 'poses', 'moves', 'such', 'when', 'have', 'jump', 'feet', 'other', 'hand', 'really', 'speed', 'routine', 'instructions', 'are', 'so', 'brief', 'moves', 'are', 'so', 'quick', 'frequently', 'have', 'look', 'up', 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'next', 'move', 'guidance', 'definitely', 'lacking', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'course', 'can', 'learn', 'routine', 'playing', 'video', 'again', 'again', 'personally', 'think', 'teacher', 'should', 'guide', 'her/his', 'students', 'more', 'think', 'teachers', 'do', 'are', 'always', 'respected', 'more', 'students.I', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'too', 'focused', 'working', 'out', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'yoga', 'basics', 'When', 'do', 'vinyasa', 'yoga', 'do', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'workout', 'benefit', ""'m"", 'okay', 'part', 'also', 'teacher', 'warm', 'up', 'well', 'lots', 'sun', 'salutations', 'same', 'token', 'use', 'gradual', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'cool-down', 'techniques', 'wind', 'things', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'Kathryn', 'workout', 'just', 'go', 'go', 'go', 'done.So', 'verdict', ""'re"", 'looking', 'quick', 'intense', 'vinyasa', 'routine', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', ""'re"", 'bit', 'more', 'traditionalist', 'terms', 'yoga', ""'re"", 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'enjoy', 'video', 'so', 'much', 'Look', 'instead', 'programs', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Janet', 'Stone', 'Sadie', 'Nardini', 'who', 'opinion', 'blend', 'two', 'worlds', 'yoga', 'fundamentals', 'intense', 'vinyasa', 'workout', 'much', 'better']",Aim True Yoga

Normally, I prefer my Yoga DVD workouts to be filmed outside, mostly with a beach/ocean back drop, or a lake of some kind and mountains. I'm a pisces, and I just connect with water, what can say?! But this was filmed in a very beautiful loft; high ceilings, hardwood floors, pocket doors at the very back of the loft pushed wide open giving the space that indoor/outdoor living feel. The minimal white furniture with beautiful accent pillows and white flowing curtains was totally acceptable; so needless to say, I DIDN'T HATE IT! lol. Usually workout DVDs done in a studio just bore me to death for some reason.I decided to skip the beginner section and go straight to intermediate. I'm still trying to decide if this was a mistake! (haha) The beginner section is pretty beginner-ish, the intermediate however, is more at the advanced level if you ask me. I wanted a video that didn't have the same old Yoga moves, but ones that challenged me, and this definitely did that! I moved through the workout, I accepted the challenging poses, attempted them, and if I wasn't able to do them I just told myself I'll get better with time. Let me tell you, I STILL don't know how she gets into some of the poses, but I'm determined to get there! I know one thing, I didn't wanna cop out and go back to the beginner workout, that's for sure. I thought about the workout all night, and couldn't wait to do it again, anxious to improve.If  you are a beginner, then start with the beginner section. I read several reviews where people seem frustrated that this is not for beginners, but I feel the beginner section is truly a starting point, and not overwhelming if you have only minimal experience with the practice of Yoga. Heck, I consider myself somewhat of a beginner, and I loved the intermediate section even though I sucked at it! Just do what you can; this is the point, be cautious not to injure yourself and you'll be fine.I find Kathryn full of bright, easy energy. She has a great body, gorgeous skin, and she smiles throughout this workout; I was encouraged and motivated and love how she doesn't take herself too seriously. Another thing I appreciated was how down to earth she was, and how she focused more on the physical benefits of the practice verses constant yapping about New Age ideology and what not. I really don't need all that. She does mention moving away from fear and being present, which I can appreciate.If you want to challenge yourself, and move away from your run of the mill Yoga workout, get this.

The DVD contains a ""beginner"" workout that I felt was more of an intermediate practice. If I had tried the ""beginner"" practice when I WAS a beginner at yoga I would not have been able to do all the poses or make it through the whole workout. As an intermediate yogi I feel this DVD is good for me. It is challenging, but I can do all the poses and exercises on the DVD. Here are some of the features I did and did not like about this DVD:Things I like about this DVD:-I think this is a great DVD to prepare one for inverted poses. There are little exercises thrown in throughout both the beginner and intermediate practices to help build arm strength and balance.-The voice over is very motivating, Katheryn (the instructor)offers great encouragement along with the instructional dialogue.-There is a very helpful section on this DVD where some of the more challenging poses are broken down and explained in a very helpful step-by-step way.-The set is simple and peaceful. This is important to me because it sets the mood and tone of the workout.-The whole energy and atmosphere of the workouts are fun and youthful and bouncy. Very motivating!Things I don't like about this DVD:-The camera work does not always follow Katheryn's movements well and sometimes it is a little hard to see what she is doing.-Some of the poses are not mentioned in the voice over. This only happens a couple of times, but it is annoying when you are in Downward Dog, not looking at the screen, and then the next pose mentioned is a standing pose with no transition. This only happens once or twice, so it's not the end of the world, just mildly annoying.-Sometimes the voice over does not keep up with what is going on in the video.",4,Pros and Cons,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,1802,"['yoga', 'DVD', 'intermediate/advanced', 'yogis', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'DVD', 'beginner', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'intermediate', 'practice', 'had', 'tried', 'beginner', 'practice', 'when', 'WAS', 'beginner', 'yoga', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'poses', 'make', 'whole', 'workout', 'intermediate', 'yogi', 'feel', 'DVD', 'good', 'challenging', 'can', 'do', 'poses', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'Here', 'are', 'features', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'DVD', 'Things', 'like', 'DVD', '-I', 'think', 'great', 'DVD', 'prepare', 'one', 'inverted', 'poses', 'are', 'little', 'exercises', 'thrown', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'practices', 'help', 'build', 'arm', 'strength', 'balance.-The', 'voice', 'very', 'motivating', 'Katheryn', 'instructor', 'great', 'encouragement', 'instructional', 'dialogue.-There', 'very', 'helpful', 'section', 'DVD', 'where', 'more', 'challenging', 'poses', 'are', 'broken', 'down', 'explained', 'very', 'helpful', 'step-by-step', 'way.-The', 'set', 'simple', 'peaceful', 'important', 'mood', 'tone', 'workout.-The', 'whole', 'energy', 'atmosphere', 'workouts', 'are', 'fun', 'youthful', 'bouncy', 'Very', 'motivating', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'DVD', '-The', 'camera', 'work', 'not', 'always', 'follow', 'Katheryn', 'movements', 'well', 'sometimes', 'little', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'doing.-Some', 'poses', 'are', 'not', 'mentioned', 'voice', 'only', 'couple', 'times', 'annoying', 'when', 'are', 'Downward', 'Dog', 'not', 'looking', 'screen', 'then', 'next', 'pose', 'mentioned', 'standing', 'pose', 'transition', 'only', 'once', 'twice', 'not', 'end', 'world', 'just', 'mildly', 'voice', 'not', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'video']",Aim True Yoga
1427758,AT844U3DB302X,B004TFTE90,Travel Bug,"[2, 2]","I was ready for a new yoga DVD and this one does the trick! 24/f/fairly in shape. When I return from an exercise break this is a good place to start. Kathryn Budig is an awesome person to watch do yoga, she is so graceful and makes it look so easy. Her instruction is clear and concise and I enjoy the inspiring mental positivity that she brings up as you go. This one is very fun and brings in new moves (archer sequence and handstand prep exercises). The image on the front of the DVD isn't done in the practice if you are curious.While it is semi flow sequences, this is more of an aerobic exercise and less of a focus on meditation and breathing. I enjoy this compared to other yoga DVDs where afterwards I don't feel that I worked out. This is a good balance between stretching and strength.The beginners workout is a great place to start or for a lighter work out if combining it with other exercises. I find it is a good work out on its own. The advanced one is 45 minutes. There are several handstand prep exercises so you need to have a basic amount of core/upper body strength, please be careful if you try these!",4,Love it!,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,1123,"['was', 'ready', 'new', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'one', 'trick', '24/f/fairly', 'shape', 'When', 'return', 'exercise', 'break', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'Kathryn', 'Budig', 'awesome', 'person', 'watch', 'do', 'yoga', 'so', 'graceful', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'instruction', 'clear', 'concise', 'enjoy', 'inspiring', 'mental', 'positivity', 'up', 'go', 'one', 'very', 'fun', 'brings', 'new', 'moves', 'archer', 'sequence', 'handstand', 'prep', 'exercises', 'image', 'front', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'done', 'practice', 'are', 'curious.While', 'semi', 'flow', 'sequences', 'more', 'aerobic', 'exercise', 'less', 'focus', 'meditation', 'breathing', 'enjoy', 'compared', 'other', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'where', 'afterwards', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'worked', 'out', 'good', 'balance', 'stretching', 'strength.The', 'beginners', 'workout', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'lighter', 'work', 'combining', 'other', 'exercises', 'find', 'good', 'work', 'out', 'own', 'advanced', 'one', '45', 'minutes', 'are', 'several', 'handstand', 'prep', 'exercises', 'need', 'have', 'basic', 'amount', 'core/upper', 'body', 'strength', 'please', 'be', 'careful', 'try']",Aim True Yoga

I tried Authentic Flow which is the intermediate 45 minute practice on this DVD and liked it a lot, it really packs a punch in this short time. It starts with a warm up of some down dog - chaturanga - cobra vinyasas and some sun salutations and then some core work on your back which was very nice and a little challenging and includes boat and half boat pose as well as some others. There's also cool vinyasas with side plank variations and warrior one, warrior 3 to high lunge and revolved lunge and a cool archer sequence where you aim an imaginary arrow in warrior 1, 2 and extended side angle . Other poses include half moon and crow, half standing splits with some kicking as a prep for handstand, pikes, forearm stand prep and 2 rounds of wheel , it ends with happy baby , lying twist, Paschimottanasana, and double pigeon. There's a short to non existent shavasana but you can stay longer on your own of course. The 25 minute beginner includes the more basic standing poses and easier variations of some poses like side plank with the top leg on the floor. There's also an 8 minute yoga pose tutorial that includes good explanations and some tips on shoulder placement, pikes , crow , half moon and tripod headstand. There is also a link to a nice 10 minute core work which is actaully 5 minutes. Overall I really liked it and Kathryn tips during the practice are helpful and her explanations are amusing at times. I hope she'll come up with some more DVD's in the future that includes more fun, challenge and arm balances.
