The protagonist is brought up in a French-Arab household and is subject to all of the clich&eacute;s that this signifies . . the treatment of women like slaves, selling girls into marriage (after first showing the buyer their teeth, like buying a horse), subject to beatings on a whim, the lack of humanity paid to these women by those who are supposed to help them, even when they are man-handled by others.  And of course, the insincerity of all of this, and the utter lack of any moral scruples of these men towards their women, as Malika notes that after buying her ""family"" motorbikes and other presents, they will forget their distaste towards her.The French men in this movie are disgusting, and morally corrupt, but of a different nature and magnitude of the other males in the story.  All, in all, it is the women who are the heroes and if not entirely without blame certainly they outshine the men.  There is not one man who is anything but contemptible in the entire movie, and the ending provides a feel-good experience that I expect is not gender-specific.

It often can and in this film, the gradual awakening of an unconsciously and morally oppressed Parisian woman acts as a catalyst for the emancipation of others - mainly women but hopefully some men as well.Some have said that this is a feminist or ""woman's"" film.  It is in the sense that women play central roles in their own awakening.  But it is so much more.  It is a human film, a story that dares to reveal the sordidness of Muslim religious traditions that betray love and trust within families and destroys outsiders as well.  The filmmaker has taken pains to develop the story so that its credibility never falters.  A young Algerian Muslim woman demonstrates that even though she has been betrayed as a matter of course by her family she resists, endangering her life, and never losing sight of hope and freedom.Not a moment goes by that this film is less than engrossing.  Its power envelops and its twists and turns are believable.  The viewer will be enriched for having experienced this film, and though it may anger some Muslims, its message is one that should be taken to heart by this community.

Radhika Brakni is terrific as a young, beautiful Moslem girl who escapes her father's plot to sell her in marriage to an older man only to find herself kinapped by a sex slavery ring. Using her wits, she uses her sexuality (and knowledge of men) to get rich and hides these funds from the pimps.  When they find out, they attempt to beat her to death.When a French male collides with the girl on the road, he ignores her danger - thus leading to the terrible beating. The wife of the driver (Helene) is haunted by the apathy of her husband (and her son) so she tracks down the endangered prostitute and nurses her back to health.Now, it's a game of cat and mouse as the thugs try to recapturethe heroine, and she joins up with Helene and her mother to escape the brutal kidnappers.  In the end, the criminals get their due...and the men in Helene's life are ""left out in the cold.""This is a chic flic so women everywhere will love this film.

Buttkus,"[0, 6]","The eternal struggle between men and women-the incessant need to couple-meshed with the struggle to co-exist in the same space-is not terribly well served in this unruly, sophomoric, and oddly-crafted dramatic comedy. The film is just out of balance-slanting strongly toward the wonderful goodness of women versus the arrogant selfishness of men. The message of the movie-that this world would be a marvelous place if society were essentially matriarchal-was delivered like a sledge hammer pounding a roofing nail.Writer/director Coline Serreau has built her reputation by making cheeky rapid-fire entertainments that endeavor to double as vehicles to attack the world's woes. Her best known film was THREE MEN AND A CRADLE (1985)-and she was involved with the American remake and sequel. CHAOS is a feminist fable that is essentially out of focus. Serreau has approached the material laden with such a dark humor that her jabs lack any real power. The action becomes a cartoon.There are several sub-plots in the film. When I reflect on the film-and try and sort out the several ingredients-- trying to make sense of it all-I find myself being more aware of the parts than I am of the whole. It is like consuming a poorly prepared dish that has been overly spiced-a sophomoric souffl&eacute; that separates on the palette--that never comes together. So it turns out to be many things-actually many movies stirred sarcastically.Though I felt that the fairy tale ending was not heart-warming-bordering on being insulting-I realized that the feminine side of my nature smiled in unison with those four female characters on the bench by the sea. It was my prickly masculine side that railed against the sexist and feminist pat quality of the epilogue.",2,I Am Woman,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,1747,"['eternal', 'struggle', 'men', 'women-the', 'incessant', 'need', 'couple-meshed', 'struggle', 'co-exist', 'same', 'space-is', 'not', 'terribly', 'well', 'served', 'unruly', 'sophomoric', 'oddly-crafted', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'film', 'just', 'balance-slanting', 'strongly', 'wonderful', 'goodness', 'women', 'arrogant', 'selfishness', 'men', 'message', 'movie-that', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'marvelous', 'place', 'society', 'were', 'essentially', 'matriarchal-was', 'delivered', 'sledge', 'hammer', 'pounding', 'roofing', 'nail.Writer/director', 'Coline', 'Serreau', 'built', 'reputation', 'making', 'cheeky', 'rapid-fire', 'entertainments', 'endeavor', 'double', 'vehicles', 'attack', 'world', 'woes', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'was', 'THREE', 'MEN', 'A', 'CRADLE', '1985', '-and', 'was', 'involved', 'American', 'remake', 'sequel', 'CHAOS', 'feminist', 'fable', 'essentially', 'focus', 'Serreau', 'approached', 'material', 'laden', 'dark', 'humor', 'jabs', 'lack', 'real', 'power', 'action', 'cartoon.There', 'are', 'several', 'sub-plots', 'film', 'When', 'reflect', 'film-and', 'try', 'sort', 'several', 'ingredients', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'all-I', 'find', 'being', 'more', 'aware', 'parts', 'am', 'whole', 'consuming', 'poorly', 'prepared', 'dish', 'been', 'overly', 'spiced-a', 'sophomoric', 'souffl', 'eacute', 'palette', 'never', 'together', 'out', 'be', 'many', 'things-actually', 'many', 'movies', 'stirred', 'felt', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'heart-warming-bordering', 'being', 'insulting-I', 'realized', 'feminine', 'side', 'nature', 'smiled', 'unison', 'four', 'female', 'characters', 'bench', 'sea', 'was', 'prickly', 'masculine', 'side', 'railed', 'sexist', 'feminist', 'pat', 'quality', 'epilogue']",N/A

A middle-class Parisian couple, driving through the streets to a dinner party suddenly encounters a young prostitute being assaulted by three men.  The young woman is bloodied and frightened and she runs to their car in a fit of terror.  She gets no help from the couple, however, as the husband locks the door and is annoyed that his windshield is bloodied.  The wife watches in horror as the young prostitute is further beaten.The wife, Helene, played by Catherine Frot, is appalled at her insensitive husband and, the next day goes to the hospital to see if the young woman is still alive.  She finds her alive, but barely - in a coma and paralyzed.  She's so moved that she takes a leave from work and spends all her time in the hospital, tending the recovering woman through a long and arduous recovery.  Rachinda Brakni, cast as Noemie, the prostitute, is a fine actress and absolutely captivating with her huge dark eyes and mop of curly hair.  She invokes our sympathy completely, especially after the wicked pimps come to the hospital and try to kidnap her.In the meantime there is trouble in Helene's household which plays out like a satirical comedy, as her husband and son seem to embody the very worst attributes of men.  Helene is devoted to Noemie, however, and Noemie eventually recovers completely and shares her incredible story through flashbacks. During the next half of the film, the women plot revenge and eventually the bad guys get caught, the husband and son get their comeuppance and the ending is happy and satisfying.The film is a fast paced and well-scripted view of the role of women.  There's lots of brutality and bloodshed as well as a satirical look at our society.  And even though the plot is extremely contrived, it was done so well that I was totally enraptured by it all.  There's great storytelling, acting and directing and it doesn't drag for one minute.  I absolutely loved it.  Highly recommended.",5,Brutality against women. And then revenge!

The movie then turns into something else: a marriage that's just about over; a son who is spoiled and rotten (like the father); a society that treats their women worse than animals, etc.Mainly, it's how two women fight back and take their lives into their own hands and begin again.The beginning is amazing when the husband refuses to see his mother who has come from the country.  After leaving, the mother waits and sees that his son was there but didn't want to see her.Then the wife, who lied to the mother, tries to see her son but is told by his then-girlfriend he's not there.  Across the street, she sees her son leave.  What goes round comes round.  A reall wake-up call.This is one amazing movie that you will not forget.

772201,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000C23CW,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 12]","French director Coline Serreau is perhaps best known for her &quot;3 Men and a Cradle&quot; which later developed into a Hollywood remake &quot;Three Men and a Baby.&quot;  Using digital camera, she made a comedy thriller &quot;Chaos&quot; starring two talented leads Catherine Frot and Rachida Brakni.  But the film is not good as some people say, filled with awful stereotypes and prejudice.The story is basically about a kind housewife Helene, who happens to encounter at night an Algerian prostitute Noemie who was brutally beaten by mobsters.  She wants to help her, but her husband stops her, afraid of being involved with a trouble.  Then, being remorseful, Helene visits her in the hospital, and while between the unlikely pair grows a friendship, they decide to fight back against what has been oppressing them until now.I admit the plot is great (and there is a talk about Hollywood remake, which is understandable).  However, the film damages every good thing about it by showing bad aspects of radical feminism -- in short, in this film, all men are hopelessly egoistic, and all the women are good and powerful.  Helene's husband is a typical example, always complaining and obnoxious, a kind of a guy who orders his wife cook and wash.  OK, there are some guys like that, I know, but his character is too one-dimentional, as if coming from the women's lib age.This biased view doesn't stop there.  Helene's son is also a terribly self-centered bloke (who uses a bad language before his mom) while his girlfriends are independent and can do what they want to do.  So why are these girls attracted to this stupid boy in the first place?BUT the most awful and insensible thing about &quot;Choas&quot; is its descriptios about the immigrants in France.  The film shows how women are treated in the immigrants' community, and I do not totally deny what it says.  But the film depicts this community (mainly the Muslims in mind) in a very perfunctory way, ignoring that they have their own say about the issues like gender and  marriage.  See much credible French film &quot;Hate&quot; if you don't know what I am saying.Because of the good acting and the light touch of the film, the selfish side of males are mitigated, making them sometimes even likeable (great work by Vincent Lindon), but there is some tone of patronizing in the descriptions, which is quite irritating to me.  I don't know how you feel, but beware, there is nothing remarkable or subtle in the director's job.It is true that newcomer Rachida Brakni has a great talent (who deservedly won one Cezar award), but the director's dated values about men and women killed all these good things in here.  Don't compare this one with much superior &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; in which Lola's dynamic character is balanced with her tender side.  Remember, she was running for love, not for agenda.",2,Good Actors Marred by Director's Dated View on Men and Women,1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,2864,"['French', 'director', 'Coline', 'Serreau', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'quot', '3', 'Men', 'Cradle', 'quot', 'later', 'developed', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'quot', 'Three', 'Men', 'Baby.', 'quot', 'Using', 'digital', 'camera', 'made', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'quot', 'Chaos', 'quot', 'starring', 'two', 'talented', 'leads', 'Catherine', 'Frot', 'Rachida', 'Brakni', 'film', 'not', 'good', 'people', 'say', 'filled', 'awful', 'stereotypes', 'prejudice.The', 'story', 'basically', 'kind', 'housewife', 'Helene', 'who', 'encounter', 'night', 'Algerian', 'prostitute', 'Noemie', 'who', 'was', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'mobsters', 'help', 'husband', 'afraid', 'being', 'involved', 'trouble', 'Then', 'being', 'remorseful', 'Helene', 'hospital', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'friendship', 'decide', 'fight', 'back', 'what', 'been', 'oppressing', 'now.I', 'admit', 'plot', 'great', 'talk', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'understandable', 'However', 'film', 'damages', 'good', 'thing', 'showing', 'bad', 'aspects', 'radical', 'feminism', 'short', 'film', 'men', 'are', 'hopelessly', 'egoistic', 'women', 'are', 'good', 'powerful', 'Helene', 'husband', 'typical', 'example', 'always', 'complaining', 'obnoxious', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'orders', 'wife', 'cook', 'wash.', 'OK', 'are', 'guys', 'know', 'character', 'too', 'one-dimentional', 'coming', 'women', 'lib', 'age.This', 'biased', 'view', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'Helene', 'son', 'also', 'terribly', 'self-centered', 'bloke', 'who', 'bad', 'language', 'mom', 'girlfriends', 'are', 'independent', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'So', 'why', 'are', 'girls', 'attracted', 'stupid', 'boy', 'first', 'place', 'most', 'awful', 'insensible', 'thing', 'quot', 'Choas', 'quot', 'descriptios', 'immigrants', 'France', 'film', 'how', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'immigrants', 'community', 'do', 'not', 'totally', 'deny', 'what', 'film', 'community', 'mainly', 'Muslims', 'mind', 'very', 'perfunctory', 'way', 'ignoring', 'have', 'own', 'say', 'issues', 'gender', 'marriage', 'See', 'much', 'credible', 'French', 'film', 'quot', 'Hate', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'am', 'saying.Because', 'good', 'acting', 'light', 'touch', 'film', 'selfish', 'side', 'males', 'are', 'mitigated', 'making', 'sometimes', 'even', 'likeable', 'great', 'work', 'Vincent', 'Lindon', 'tone', 'patronizing', 'descriptions', 'quite', 'irritating', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'feel', 'beware', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'subtle', 'director', 'job.It', 'true', 'newcomer', 'Rachida', 'Brakni', 'great', 'talent', 'who', 'deservedly', 'won', 'one', 'Cezar', 'award', 'director', 'dated', 'values', 'men', 'women', 'killed', 'good', 'things', 'here', 'Do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'one', 'much', 'superior', 'quot', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'quot', 'Lola', 'dynamic', 'character', 'balanced', 'tender', 'side', 'Remember', 'was', 'running', 'love', 'not', 'agenda']",N/A
