But, I was too young to watch such TV since mostly my interests were in cartoons and teen sitcoms like ""Growing Pains"", ""Family Ties"", ""Who's the Boss"".  This series probably will grow with you after you get through the pilot episode.  Now, I can look back and see why this show has its charm.  This probably paved the road for NBC dramedy series like ""Providence"" and ""Ed"".  It kinda re-opens the book on the whole idea of growing up in secluded town of friendly folks.Okay, the orange parka is cute and the price is well pricey for just 8 episodes.  So, I suggest just watching a few episodes by checking out from library or renting it.  Overall, DVD format itself is probably just basis for those who dread all those fancy menus.  The price you pay for quirky TV show with interesting music is the simple treatment.  No frills with exception of some random clips/bloopers added in.  Supposedly getting rights for music is very time-consuming and also expensive so the rest of the seasons have replaced the original music.  Thankfully, this first season keeps all the music and you probably will enjoy the selection.Overall, this is just a simple release but everything is intacted.  So, beware of future releases since music will be replaced which may be pretty obvious in certain scenes.  By the way, there is no insert which tells you what episodes are on the discs.  So, you probably want to search online for a self-made DVD insert.  Also, these are double-sided DVDs which mean you gotta be careful of scratching when flipping discs.  Not my favorite format but it does reduce the number of DVDs to carry around.  Plus, you got that fancy parka to show off to friends if they remember this wonderful series.",5,"""Northern Exposure"" is a Fresh Look of Dramedy in the 90s",1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,1786,"['Northern', 'Exposure', 'started', 'mid-season', 'series', 'CBS', '90s', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'watch', 'such', 'TV', 'mostly', 'interests', 'were', 'cartoons', 'teen', 'sitcoms', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'Family', 'Ties', 'Who', 'Boss', 'series', 'probably', 'will', 'grow', 'get', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Now', 'can', 'look', 'back', 'see', 'why', 'show', 'charm', 'probably', 'paved', 'road', 'NBC', 'dramedy', 'series', 'Providence', 'Ed', 'kinda', 'book', 'whole', 'idea', 'growing', 'up', 'secluded', 'town', 'friendly', 'folks.Okay', 'orange', 'parka', 'cute', 'price', 'well', 'pricey', 'just', '8', 'episodes', 'So', 'suggest', 'just', 'watching', 'few', 'episodes', 'checking', 'out', 'library', 'renting', 'Overall', 'DVD', 'format', 'probably', 'just', 'basis', 'who', 'dread', 'fancy', 'menus', 'price', 'pay', 'quirky', 'TV', 'show', 'interesting', 'music', 'simple', 'treatment', 'frills', 'exception', 'random', 'clips/bloopers', 'added', 'Supposedly', 'getting', 'rights', 'music', 'very', 'time-consuming', 'also', 'expensive', 'so', 'rest', 'seasons', 'have', 'replaced', 'original', 'music', 'Thankfully', 'first', 'season', 'music', 'probably', 'will', 'enjoy', 'selection.Overall', 'just', 'simple', 'release', 'everything', 'intacted', 'So', 'beware', 'future', 'releases', 'music', 'will', 'be', 'replaced', 'may', 'be', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'certain', 'scenes', 'way', 'insert', 'what', 'episodes', 'are', 'discs', 'So', 'probably', 'want', 'search', 'online', 'self-made', 'DVD', 'insert', 'Also', 'are', 'double-sided', 'DVDs', 'mean', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'careful', 'scratching', 'when', 'flipping', 'discs', 'Not', 'favorite', 'format', 'reduce', 'number', 'DVDs', 'carry', 'around', 'got', 'fancy', 'parka', 'show', 'off', 'friends', 'remember', 'wonderful', 'series']",N/A

Hope to see the full series available someday. But, as a consumer, I deserve better. I'm not going to grovel and say ""It's OK to give us a cheaply-made product, just so I have any version of NX on DVD!"" I don't mind paying a high price for a quality production, but this is an embarrassment to Universal. It's like they let the interns take over or something. Actually, my interns produce better work than this - maybe they SHOULD'VE turned it over to the interns.I'm one of those fans who's willing to pay the price because I love the series, but who thinks we're getting ripped off with the sloppiness and cheap production of this DVD. I don't believe for one minute the music licensing is the cause of this. If the DVD had been produced properly, I'd be OK with the price, but this is the flimsiest version of a TV season DVD I've ever seen.The annoyances of this DVD set: The parka package is a cheap gimmick I could do without. Just makes it annoying to pack and store. I took it off and stuck it in a closet somewhere. I would rather have seen the effort that went into the parka go into the DVD (I know it doesn't work that way). Flimsy, two-sided discs are really annoying. They had to do this for a mere 8 episodes? Rubbish. It makes it frustrating to play. Labeling is confusing, hard to read, poorly done.  I wouldn't even care to pay this price for a mere 8 episodes, if the quality of this was as it should be. And, it looks as if we have the same sloppiness to look forward to with the second season. I also wasn't impressed with the extras. They could've boosted the quality by giving fans something special here, but don't seem to be committed enough to this project to do so.It is great to see the episodes here. Aurora Borealis is one of my favorites. I'd buy the set just for this one. The only draw to this set is if it has episodes on it you really want to have. If it does, you'll probably give in to the price, put up with the poor quality and buy the set. That's how good the show was.I'm hoping someday we'll get a properly-produced box set of this series that is produced with the care it deserves.

The premise is lifted out of the situation comedy handbook - a new doctor is forced to practice in a remote Alaskan village to pay off a medical school scholarship.  At the surface, it sounds like a collision course with wackiness.Fortunately, we are spared the cheap shots this premise suggests.  Dr. Fleischman (Rob Morrow) is indeed a fish out of water, but we don't see him struggling with his furnace or complaining about the harsh environment (at least not very much.)  Rather, the tension of this series relates to his attempt to practice medicine in a community filled with bizarre and wonderful characters.There is an ex-astronaut attempting to create a media empire in this remote community.  He owns a radio station featuring a DJ more interested in philosophy than spinning records or reporting the weather. The town eatery is owned by an ex-trapper living with a woman 1/3 of his age.Of all of the characters Dr. Fleischman contends with, the best by far is his receptionist.  Marilyn Whirlwind (Elaine Miles) is a rare actress who can emote without saying a word or lifting an eyebrow.  In fact, ""Northern Exposure"" is a rare series that is not afraid to effectively use a moment of silence to underscore a dramatic point.The show is funny, but not in an obnoxious or obvious fashion. The characters are warm and richly drawn.  Actually, it is a happy surprise that this show lasted as long as it did.  We are fortunate that it has come to DVD to enjoy new life.

They've made us wait a long, long time for it. Many have commented on the excellence of this series, and they're right. That said, let's examine the faults of this DVD. What cynicism prompted makers of this DVD to include no insert to tell us about the series or, at the very least, what episodes are on which disk? What made them include ineradicable promos for shows in which many of us have no interest and will have to fast forward through forever? What made them think that charging $45 or more for eight episodes with the above deficiencies was ethical or moral or even good business? This DVD was put together by people who apparently have no concept of the spirit of this show and know only the greed of trying to bilk lovers of NE of more for less. Why didn't they at least provide a decent combined package of the early episodes to make it a reasonable value? As much as I love &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, this makes me want to boycott future releases if this is the way they intend to treat the fans. The cheesy parka the DVD comes in doesn't cover the multitude of sins the makers of this DVD have committed. They should be ashamed of themselves.

600527,A1DX4HZSAUQ83H,B00005JLG3,Joshua Etarbelak,"[265, 277]","Let me first apologize to all the furious Northern Exposure fans for the single star rating.  I know that's going to burn some people.  But Amazon asks for a review of the DVD, and this a honest rating of this DVD set.The show itself deserves five stars, of course.  But you already knew that.  There are few people out there who are going to buy this set having never seen the show.So, to be blunt, this DVD set is really a piece of garbage.  It appears that absolutely no thought was put into making it.  Well, perhaps they thought about how cheaply they could make it.  But that's about it.  The weak points:1. You only get eight episodes.  While I know the first season only has eight episodes, it is deceptive to market like other seasons that contain 20 or more epsiodes.  Why not combine the first two seasons on one set?  Better to rip off the fans, of course.2. There are only two double-sided discs in the set.  This is inexcusably cheap.  It is also unecessary, since they could easily fit four episodes on one side of a disc.  (Especially since they lack any substantial bonus materials.)3.  Here is my biggest gripe.  There are mandatory previews to watch at the beginning of the DVD!!!  When I say mandatory, I mean your remote control is locked out, and you have to sit and watch the previews EVERY TIME you put in the disc.  Now, before anyone contradicts me, I acknowledge that you can fast forward.  But you cannot chapter-skip ahead or jump straight to the main menu.  What this does is essentially reduce the DVD medium into an glorified VHS tape.  With all the unlimited possibilities of DVDs, this studio gives us almost no bonus materials and decides instead to force us to watch their crappy previews. What's next, Pepsi commercials?You would think with piracy alledgedly being such a problem for these studios, they would make more of an effort to make a product people would be happy to pay for.Instead they give us what amounts to a VHS tape on a disc, poorly designed, and cheaply made.

600528,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B00005JLG3,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[6, 8]","When I'm having one of those crummy days that I just assume forget, I find that one of the best things to do is to put on a DVD from the '90s comedy-drama, ""Northern Exposure"". There is something about this TV show, it's characters and the self-contained world it creates, that just makes you forget about everything else around you. It just sucks you in. In the first season we meet Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), a rather insecure, self-analyzing, New Yorker (think of a younger, better looking version of Woody Allen), who is expecting to be paying back the $125,000 worth of medical school tuition, that the great state of Alaska subsidized, by working in the big city of Anchorage. But the pencil pushers have a different ideal and he winds up in the tiny, rustic town of Cicely, Alaska (Pop.215), which while beautiful, is basically in the middle of no-where. The town is populated by some rather free spirited folks, who seem to downplay prevailing logic (much to Dr. Fleischman's consternation) and take a rather layed back, somewhat surreal attitude towards life and the many strange situations it might present. This is one of those places where everyone knows each others business and they arn't afraid to express their opinions. This is just the broadest sketch of what the show is about. The series created by Joshua Brand & John Falsey is well written (how many TV shows quote Neizche & Walt Witman?) and each episode feels more like a philosophical meditation, rather then a straight ahead TV plot. The ensemble cast is absolutely wonderful and brings insight into some of the more interesting characters to come out of the TV medium. How many TV shows have among it's characters a neurotic physician, an ex-astronaut, an ice queen Bush pilot, a philosophizing  radio DJ, a teenage beauty queen, and a half-indian filmmaker? This is one of those shows that once you start you won't be able to stop. It's that addictive. Highly recommended!",5,"Welcome to Cicely...

And I had forgotten just how important the music tracks were to the story. You've got to salute Universal for doing this right. And, as others have pointed out, this is the reason for the hefty price tag.This is one of the most important additions to my DVD collection. Northern Exposure isn't just a TV series. It transcends both television and cinema as a poetic statement about the human condition. What is captured here is that which has eluded most artists, writers, philosophers, musicians and filmmakers. This is the holy grail of storytelling with a human face, stretching from the Northern Lights into inner space. I never get tired of going to Cicely, Alaska, or watching its characters and scenery in the turmoil and beauty of life, literally relishing each frame of video second by second.Okay. Enough hyperbole. What's really great about these 8 episodes is that you have the initial working seeds for the entire series. Everything you've got to know about these characters...Fleischman, Maggy, Shelly, Holly, Maurice, Chris, Ed, et al...is right here in these 8 episodes. My favorite episode is the very first appearance of Adam. Watching the interaction between Adam (the recluse hermit and Vet) and Joel (the yuppie doctor) is simply amazing.I always found myself wanting to kick Joel for being such an ass. But character development is the whole point of Northern Exposure, and it's simply wonderful watching Dr. Fleischman change throughout the series, and how Maggie plays off of this character. I still have the later video where Maggie and Fleischman actually...well, don't let me give away any spoilers if you're new to the series. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.Finally, STOP BASHING UNIVERSAL!!! People, this DVD set MUST sell in order to give the company a return on its investment. It's all about economy of scale. Not putting Northern Exposure on DVD is a crime. But us not buying this for ourselves and posterity is also a crime. Blame the music companies for sticking it to Universal (and everybody else too). I will grant you that I could have done without the parka packaging; they should have put those dollars into a show guide and DVD labels on 4 DVDs (rather than the two double-sided DVDs, which just makes them more prone to DVD rot if you don't handle with care).To put Northern Exposure into perspective, I generally like all kinds of genre: action, comedy, fantasy, historical, science fiction, musicals. I would place Northern Exposure at the very top just on its entertainment value alone. The fact that it is also insightful, endearing and intelligent is just amazing.",5,It Just Doesn't Get Any Better Than This!!!,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,3085,"['was', 'just', 'watching', 'old', 'sparse', 'video', 'collection', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'last', 'year', 'struck', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'quot', 'fine', 'wine', 'quot', 'had', 'become', 'time', 'prospect', 'seeing', 'remarkable', 'series', 'DVD', 'had', 'been', 'fairly', 'bleak', 'then', 'licensing', 'problems', 'related', 'soundtrack', 'Frankly', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'hope.Watching', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'DVD', 'completely', 'new', 'experience', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'simply', 'incredible', 'had', 'forgotten', 'just', 'how', 'important', 'music', 'tracks', 'were', 'story', ""'ve"", 'got', 'salute', 'Universal', 'doing', 'right', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'reason', 'hefty', 'price', 'tag.This', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'additions', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Northern', 'Exposure', ""n't"", 'just', 'TV', 'series', 'television', 'cinema', 'poetic', 'statement', 'human', 'condition', 'What', 'captured', 'here', 'eluded', 'most', 'artists', 'writers', 'philosophers', 'musicians', 'filmmakers', 'holy', 'grail', 'storytelling', 'human', 'face', 'stretching', 'Northern', 'Lights', 'inner', 'space', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'going', 'Cicely', 'Alaska', 'watching', 'characters', 'scenery', 'turmoil', 'beauty', 'life', 'literally', 'relishing', 'frame', 'video', 'second', 'second.Okay', 'Enough', 'hyperbole', 'What', 'really', 'great', '8', 'episodes', 'have', 'initial', 'working', 'seeds', 'entire', 'series', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'got', 'know', 'characters', 'Fleischman', 'Maggy', 'Shelly', 'Holly', 'Maurice', 'Chris', 'Ed', 'et', 'al', 'right', 'here', '8', 'episodes', 'favorite', 'episode', 'very', 'first', 'appearance', 'Adam', 'Watching', 'interaction', 'Adam', 'recluse', 'hermit', 'Vet', 'Joel', 'yuppie', 'doctor', 'simply', 'amazing.I', 'always', 'found', 'wanting', 'kick', 'Joel', 'being', 'such', 'ass', 'character', 'development', 'whole', 'point', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'watching', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'change', 'series', 'how', 'Maggie', 'character', 'still', 'have', 'later', 'video', 'where', 'Maggie', 'Fleischman', 'actually', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', ""'re"", 'new', 'series', 'Trust', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Finally', 'STOP', 'BASHING', 'UNIVERSAL', 'People', 'DVD', 'set', 'MUST', 'sell', 'order', 'give', 'company', 'return', 'investment', 'economy', 'scale', 'Not', 'putting', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'DVD', 'crime', 'not', 'buying', 'ourselves', 'posterity', 'also', 'crime', 'Blame', 'music', 'companies', 'sticking', 'Universal', 'everybody', 'else', 'too', 'will', 'grant', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'parka', 'packaging', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'dollars', 'show', 'guide', 'DVD', 'labels', '4', 'DVDs', 'rather', 'two', 'double-sided', 'DVDs', 'just', 'more', 'prone', 'DVD', 'rot', 'do', ""n't"", 'handle', 'care', '.To', 'put', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'perspective', 'generally', 'kinds', 'genre', 'action', 'comedy', 'fantasy', 'historical', 'science', 'fiction', 'musicals', 'would', 'place', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'very', 'top', 'just', 'entertainment', 'value', 'alone', 'fact', 'also', 'insightful', 'endearing', 'intelligent', 'just', 'amazing']",N/A
600542,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00005JLG3,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[14, 16]","For six seasons between 1990 and 1995, television audiences were treated to a unique show called ""Northern Exposure"", whose premise revolved around a recently graduated NYC doctor named Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow).  To pay for his medical school expenses, Dr. Fleischman entered a financial program created by the state of Alaska on the condition that he would practice medicine in Alaska upon graduation for a specified number of years.  Begrudgingly, Dr. Fleischman travels to Alaska believing that he will be working in one of the major cities.  Instead, he is required to work in the small and isolated fictional town of Cicely (filmed in the town of Roslyn, Washington), whose residents are rather quirky and which is owned and controlled primarily by a wealthy retired astronaut, Maurice J. Minnifield (Barry Corbin).  Other residents of Cicely include Dr. Fleischman's assistant, Marilyn Whirlwind (Elaine Miles), the pilot Maggie O'Connell (Janine Turner), bar owner Holling Gustaf Vincoeur (John Cullum), his girlfriend Shelly Marie Tambo Vincoeur (Cynthia Geary), the somewhat nosy buy very friendly Edward 'Ed' Chigliak (Darren E. Burrows), store owner Ruth-Anne Miller (Peg Phillips, 1918-2002) and the town's favorite local radio DJ Christopher 'Chris' Stevens (John Corbett).  Over the course of the series, a tense relationship develops between Dr. Fleischman and Maggie, Maggie's boyfriends continue to accidentally die off, Maurice fights his own inner demons and Dr. Fleischman slowly adjusts to life in untamed Alaska.Many people were not pleased when ""Northern Exposure"" was cancelled after its 1994-1995 season, but its 110 episodes are well worth watching.  The short first season includes the eight following episodes:1. ""Pilot"". Dr. Fleischman arrives in Anchorage, which doesn't need him; but the town of Cicely does.2. ""Brains, Know How and Native Intelligence"".  Dr. Fleischman attempts to treat Ed'd uncle (Frank Sotonoma Salsedo), a tribal medicine man; and Maurice is not happy to hear revelations about Walt Whitman as read by Chris on Maurice's radio station.3. ""Soapy Sanderson"". A hermit, Soapy Sanderson (John McLiam), is convinced by Dr. Fleischman to put his affairs in order with surprising results for Dr. Fleischman and Maggie.4. ""Dreams, Schemes and Putting Greens"".  Dr. Fleischman gets involved with Maurice's scheme to get Japanese investment in Cicely, and Holling proposes to Shelley.5. ""Russian Flu"".  One of my favorite episodes, all the residents of Cicely become ill and Dr. Fleischman learns a few things about traditional Native American medicine.6. ""Sex, Lies and Ed's Tapes"".  The relationship between Holling & Shelley is rocked, Ed suffers writer's block and Maggie and her boyfriend Rick (Grant Goodeve) worry about ""Maggie's curse"".7. ""A Kodiak Moment"".  Maurice wants to adopt Chris, and tension rises between Fleischman and Maggie when she takes over his childbirth class.8. ""Aurora Borealis- A Fairy Tale for Big People"".  Strange behaviors erupt in Cicely with the northern lights, and Fleischman is rescued by a man (Adam Arkin) that nobody thinks exists.""Northern Exposure"" was a truly wonderful show.  The first season DVD set includes all eight episodes, as well as deleted scenes from each of the episodes.  Though the set is a bit pricey, I rate it overall with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  After ""Northern Exposure"", John Corbett portrayed the character ""Ian Miller"" in the 2002 film ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and the character ""Aiden Shaw"" in several seasons of the HBO TV show ""Sex and the City"" (1998-2004).",5,"""Moose burger or caribou dog?""",1088035200,"06 24, 2004",2004,3599,"['six', 'seasons', '1990', '1995', 'television', 'audiences', 'were', 'treated', 'unique', 'show', 'called', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'premise', 'revolved', 'recently', 'graduated', 'NYC', 'doctor', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Joel', 'Fleischman', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'pay', 'medical', 'school', 'expenses', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'entered', 'financial', 'program', 'created', 'state', 'Alaska', 'condition', 'would', 'practice', 'medicine', 'Alaska', 'graduation', 'specified', 'number', 'years', 'Begrudgingly', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'Alaska', 'believing', 'will', 'be', 'working', 'one', 'major', 'cities', 'Instead', 'required', 'work', 'small', 'isolated', 'fictional', 'town', 'Cicely', 'filmed', 'town', 'Roslyn', 'Washington', 'residents', 'are', 'rather', 'quirky', 'owned', 'controlled', 'primarily', 'wealthy', 'retired', 'astronaut', 'Maurice', 'J.', 'Minnifield', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'Other', 'residents', 'Cicely', 'include', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'assistant', 'Marilyn', 'Whirlwind', 'Elaine', 'Miles', 'pilot', 'Maggie', ""O'Connell"", 'Janine', 'Turner', 'bar', 'owner', 'Holling', 'Gustaf', 'Vincoeur', 'John', 'Cullum', 'girlfriend', 'Shelly', 'Marie', 'Tambo', 'Vincoeur', 'Cynthia', 'Geary', 'somewhat', 'nosy', 'buy', 'very', 'friendly', 'Edward', 'Chigliak', 'Darren', 'E.', 'Burrows', 'store', 'owner', 'Ruth-Anne', 'Miller', 'Peg', 'Phillips', '1918-2002', 'town', 'favorite', 'local', 'radio', 'DJ', 'Christopher', ""'Chris"", 'Stevens', 'John', 'Corbett', 'course', 'series', 'tense', 'relationship', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'Maggie', 'Maggie', 'boyfriends', 'continue', 'accidentally', 'die', 'off', 'Maurice', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'slowly', 'life', 'untamed', 'Alaska.Many', 'people', 'were', 'not', 'pleased', 'when', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'was', 'cancelled', '1994-1995', 'season', '110', 'episodes', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'short', 'first', 'season', 'eight', 'following', 'episodes:1', 'Pilot', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'Anchorage', ""n't"", 'need', 'town', 'Cicely', 'does.2', 'Brains', 'Know', 'How', 'Native', 'Intelligence', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'treat', 'Ed', ""'d"", 'uncle', 'Frank', 'Sotonoma', 'Salsedo', 'tribal', 'medicine', 'man', 'Maurice', 'not', 'happy', 'hear', 'revelations', 'Walt', 'Whitman', 'read', 'Chris', 'Maurice', 'radio', 'station.3', 'Soapy', 'Sanderson', 'hermit', 'Soapy', 'Sanderson', 'John', 'McLiam', 'convinced', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'put', 'affairs', 'order', 'surprising', 'results', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'Maggie.4', 'Dreams', 'Schemes', 'Putting', 'Greens', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'involved', 'Maurice', 'scheme', 'get', 'Japanese', 'investment', 'Cicely', 'Holling', 'Shelley.5', 'Russian', 'Flu', 'One', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'residents', 'Cicely', 'become', 'ill', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'few', 'things', 'traditional', 'Native', 'American', 'medicine.6', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Ed', 'Tapes', 'relationship', 'Holling', 'Shelley', 'rocked', 'Ed', 'writer', 'block', 'Maggie', 'boyfriend', 'Rick', 'Grant', 'Goodeve', 'worry', 'Maggie', 'curse', '.7', 'Kodiak', 'Moment', 'Maurice', 'adopt', 'Chris', 'tension', 'rises', 'Fleischman', 'Maggie', 'when', 'childbirth', 'class.8', 'Aurora', 'Borealis-', 'A', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'Big', 'People', 'Strange', 'behaviors', 'erupt', 'Cicely', 'northern', 'lights', 'Fleischman', 'rescued', 'man', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'nobody', 'exists', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'was', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'eight', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'set', 'bit', 'pricey', 'rate', 'overall', '5', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'John', 'Corbett', 'portrayed', 'character', 'Ian', 'Miller', '2002', 'film', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'character', 'Aiden', 'Shaw', 'several', 'seasons', 'HBO', 'TV', 'show', 'Sex', 'City', '1998-2004']",N/A

From the quirky and unusual characters to the fact that while the show was airing I could drive to the town of ""Cicely, Alaska"" (actually the town of Roslyn, Washington) and literally walk the streets and visit the same stores and restaurants they did, and see where the scenes were filmed.What this show did so well was take ""Seinfeld-like"" daily events and situations of this unordinary and unusual town and capture the tensions and pulls between the characters. The interactions are always so well written that show had a level of realism in the personal relationships that made the strange events that much more captivating. Perhaps the early ""Moonlighting"" episodes were the only show that captured the on again-off again relationship tension between the lead characters as well as Northern Exposure did. Joel Fleischman is one of the better characters ever produced at depicting prolonged culture shock, and his early reactions to the differences between NYC and this little town in the middle of nowhere are priceless.The packaging of the set itself is unique with the ""down jacket"" zipped up to cover the package, although not easy to store that way.  I would have liked to see more bonus materials as well, so perhaps this will be available in set two?The entire cast is well balanced and provides the right blend of drama and comedy.

But here's the problem: The idiots in marketing at Universal have royally screwed the fans of this wonderful show. First, they're asking $60 for just eight episodes. I realize that's all there was for the first season, but gimme a huge break! Not when other shows like, say, 24, are charging around the same price for three times as many episodes! Second, they only give you two poorly labeled discs, no insert or booklet about the show its creation, or at least the chapter breaks, nothing! Third, the alleged &quot;hours of extras&quot; which are said to contain deleted scenes and hilarious outtakes are lumped together per episode, with no indication of what it contains.It's obvious to me that the idiots at Universal spent more time and thought on designing the lame little orange parka that contains the discs than on the presentation of the discs themselves. I have seen $9.95 anthologies of Beverly Hillbillies that looked far better and give much more to the buyer than this pathetic mess.I can only hope that in future season releases, the brain trust at Universal will pay attention to content instead of silly packaging and give the show and its fans the respect it deserves.",2,"Great show, but Universal Sucks",1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,1288,"['Arguably', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'come', 'television', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'finally', 'made', 'DVD', 'here', 'problem', 'idiots', 'marketing', 'Universal', 'have', 'royally', 'screwed', 'fans', 'wonderful', 'show', 'First', ""'re"", 'asking', '60', 'just', 'eight', 'episodes', 'realize', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'gim', 'huge', 'break', 'Not', 'when', 'other', 'shows', 'say', '24', 'are', 'charging', 'same', 'price', 'three', 'times', 'many', 'episodes', 'Second', 'only', 'give', 'two', 'poorly', 'labeled', 'discs', 'insert', 'booklet', 'show', 'creation', 'least', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'nothing', 'Third', 'alleged', 'quot', 'hours', 'extras', 'quot', 'are', 'said', 'contain', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'hilarious', 'outtakes', 'are', 'lumped', 'together', 'episode', 'indication', 'what', 'contains.It', 'obvious', 'idiots', 'Universal', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'thought', 'designing', 'lame', 'little', 'orange', 'parka', 'discs', 'presentation', 'discs', 'have', 'seen', '9.95', 'anthologies', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'looked', 'far', 'better', 'give', 'much', 'more', 'buyer', 'pathetic', 'mess.I', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'future', 'season', 'releases', 'brain', 'trust', 'Universal', 'will', 'pay', 'attention', 'content', 'instead', 'silly', 'packaging', 'give', 'show', 'fans', 'respect']",N/A
600545,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00005JLG3,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","Pretty much everyone that is likely to read this by now knows about the show.  Many probably watched it when it was originally on TV in the early 1990s.  It is the story of a doctor from NY (played by Rob Morrow) who , in order to pay for medical school, took a scholarship that required him to work for 4 years in Alaska.  He thought that he would be working in Anchorage, only to be shipped to the small town of Cicely.The first season only had an 8 episode run (being a mid-season replacement show).  Most of the episodes in the first season dealt with the fish out of water aspect of Dr Fleischman living on the edge of the Alaskan Wilderness and his trying to get out of the contract keeping him in Alaska.  Toward the end of the season the show begins to focus on the quirky residents of the town.The cornerstone of the show was the quality acting and writing.  The cast was truly ensemble, mainly comprised of relatively unknown actors and actresses.  It does have the feel of an early 1990s series, so some of the references in it are somewhat dated now (sharp viewers will get the dig at Twin Peaks, probably the most popular show on TV around that time) but overall the themes of the show hold up well almost 25 years later.As for the DVD set itself, unfortunately Universal went the cheap route.  There are two double sided DVDs with 2 episodes on each side.  There are also deleted and extended scenes for each episode, but unfortunately no making of or behind the scenes features to speak of.  Also be aware that there may be discs out there that were burned incorrectly.  When I originally bought season 1, the first disc had the same episodes on both sides.  So you want to make sure to check them right away so you can return it if necessary.

(Sure, ""The Sopranos"" is a better show on balance, but who is more amiable company--Ed Chigliak or Paulie Gualtieri?) This 2-CD set of the first eight episodes of Northern Exposure takes us back to the show's halcyon days, when we got our first taste of Joel and Maggie's quasi-romantic sparring, of Holling and Shelly's May-September love, of Chris's half-brilliant, half-chiselbrained philosophizing, of Maurice's slow burns and Marilyn's unflappable calm. Northern Exposure takes us to its own cozy, quirky little world and envelops us in it--a perfect sixty-minute vacation. The CD transfers on the new discs are crisp and excellent, as this extremely scenic show deserves. Yet although I appreciated the whimsy of the cute little orange zipper parka that encloses the CD box, I would gladly have traded it for a booklet on the production of the first season, and a few more extras.

Therefore I am very happy to finally have the first season on DVD. One only wishes that this great show could have gotten the treatment that its superior quality deserves.To begin with...even though the first season only comprises eight episodes. And despite the shoddy way the DVD's are put together, this set still warrants acquiring (even if Universal does not deserve money for the product).Northern Exposure is a series that was &quot;on&quot; from the beginning. The Caricaturization so often found in first seasons is almost completely lacking. The plot picks up and takes off.Most of this is due to one of the greatest ensemble casts of all time (John Cullum and John Corbett lead a long list of my favorites). This cast, wedded with excellent writing, made Northern Exposure a truly transcendent show from the very beginning.Why then the crappy treatment?I don't mind the parka-packaging. However, I would willingly trade it to not have to deal with flipper discs and previews I am forced to fast-forward through rather than skip. It is even more annoying that there is not a printed list of which episodes are on which discs (this could confuse some--particularly with the flipper discs).Sixty bucks is a bit much to shell out for something as poorly put together as this DVD set.

600558,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JLG3,Robert Moore,"[2, 4]","I give this set five stars, but I completely understand those who give it one based on 1) the paltry number of special features and 2) the astonishing price.  I'll give one defense for the latter:  by pricing the first two seasons at the same price of later one's, they help even out the expense caused by the very expensive licensing of music.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE was one of the first series to feature large amounts of music by original artists and in retaining much of the music from the original run they have to pay extremely large amounts of fees.  The cost of the music is the reason why we have not yet seen ALLY MCBEAL on DVD.  So, I can be philosophical about the cost of the first two seasons, though I will agree that the cost is excessive.On one level, NORTHERN EXPOSURE was incredibly unlucky in its debut.  Only a few weeks before its appearance TWIN PEAKS appeared, filmed only a few miles away from where NORTHERN EXPOSURE was made (both shows were made in Washington state, not far from Seattle, despite the supposed Alaska locale).  Because TWIN PEAKS was so much more extremely, it made NORTHERN EXPOSURE seem tamer than it was in reality.  In fact, NORTHERN EXPOSURE was conceived and developed separately from TWIN PEAKS, though the former quickly acknowledged the latter in its first season by visiting the waterfalls where TWIN PEAKS was filmed and making explicit reference to the log lady.Still, if one wants precedents for NORTHERN EXPOSURE, one could better compare the show to GREEN ACRES filtered through the changes that had taken place in television narrative in the 1980s.  Like Oliver, Joel Fleischman finds himself in a rural setting surrounded by a group of eccentrics who take him as stranger than any of themselves, albeit Oliver goes to his farm willingly while Joel is forced to go to Alaska.  Although NORTHERN EXPOSURE would later win an Emmy as Best Drama, it was in reality a quirky comedy.  Its closest descendent might be THE GILMORE GIRLS (though Amy Sherman-Palladino credits BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER as her favorite show and the one that has most inspired her, her creation THE GILMORE GIRLS is much closer to NORTHERN EXPOSURE), another hour-long comedy.  Amazingly, both NORTHERN EXPOSURE and ST. ELSEWHERE were inspired by the experiences of the same doctor, who was co-creator Joshua Brand's college roommate.Most shows that debut during spring or summer seasons fail, but there have been some astonishing exceptions, such as HILL STREET BLUES and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE has the very odd distinction of having been a summer or spring only series for two straight years.  It debuted with eight episodes in July 1990, returned with seven episodes in the spring of 1991, before its first full season beginning in the fall of 1991.  What I find amazing given the great irregularity of its early schedule was that they were able to hold together the original cast, and that their characters were so well defined so quickly.  Though they would develop and mature with the ensuing seasons, Joel, O'Connell, Holling, Ed, Maurice, Shelly, the ultra-laconic Marilyn, and Chris Stevens, the spiritual center of the show, were there from the very beginning.  The show would grow quirkier and the narrative became far more contextualized with ensuing seasons, but it was a great show from the very beginning.I agree that the first two seasons of the show are way overpriced.  I would have personally have preferred to see the two seasons combined in a single set, but mainly I'm just glad that these are available.

It's a treat to see them here uncut with a few extras that really add to the fun.Some have complained that only 8 episodes are on these disks but that's explained above.  Some internet talk back and forth provides explanation for some of the complaints you may see in these reviews.First, the cost is likely due to the fact that the distributors wanted to keep the original music from the show and that adds to the expense of the disks.  This is a problem that apparently has slowed or halted the release of another great series that should be on DVD - WKRP in Cincinnati.  Apparently those producers never gave much thought to releasing these on VHS (some episdoes were on VHS) or DVD and so are now stuck because of the huge cost of the royalties needed to keep the original music played in the series.  Northern Exposure would still be excellent but would not be great without the original music.Second, why not include both first and second season in one set since both had a limited number of shows made?  Cost is sited as a reason here, too.  However, rumor on the internet has it that Universal will release a set of both seasons some time before the end of the year as soon as the royalty issue can be worked out.  Supposedly, this set will have episode commentary on it as well as other features.  We'll see.Regardless of these issues, this is a good set and a great show.  There are a few things about the show that, over time, could have improved it immensely.  But I don't want to concentrate on that here.The story of Dr. Joel Fleischman's exile to Alaska to fulfill the requirements of the loan that put him through med school is the reason for our visit to Cicely, Alaska.  However, the series takes off from there and builds into characters and situations that go beyond Joel's plight.Rob Morrow is excellent as the good doctor bringing humor and desperation to a character thrown into the unknown and Barry Corbin plays the eccentric Maurice Minnefield, astronaut, visionary and entrepreneur to perfection.  Janine Turner as Maggie is both sexy and tough. John Corbett's Chris is the epitome of the quirky Cicelian character and plays some really eclectic tunes on the radio.  John Cullum plays a terrific Holling Vincoeur, owner of the best tavern/restuarant in town and lover to cute Shelly Tambo (Cynthia Geary).  Geary is good as the young vixen that charmed two older hearts and adds an unusual perspective to the show.  Darren Burrows makes the young native American Ed into a solid character who brings depth to the scenes in which he is featured as the soul of Cicely.  Elaine Miles is a novice actor but that lack of experiene only adds to the charm of her character, Marilyn.  Peg Phillips doesn't have a lot to do as Ruth-Anne at first but creates a realistic character who can be a bit grating but also compassionate.It's interesting to see some of the deleted scenes that have been added to the disk but the ""gag"" scenes are often priceless and show the cast having fun with a show that was unique and that wasn't guaranteed a time slot when it first came out.If the rumors are true, it may be better to wait for the combined set.  But if you are like me and couldn't wait to finally see this on DVD buy it now and enjoy a visit to Cicely.",5,One show that deserves DVD treatment,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,3404,"['Northern', 'Exposure', 'had', 'limited', 'first', 'season', 'run', 'summer', 'series', 'first', '8', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'treat', 'see', 'here', 'few', 'extras', 'really', 'add', 'fun.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'are', 'disks', 'explained', 'internet', 'talk', 'back', 'forth', 'explanation', 'complaints', 'may', 'see', 'reviews.First', 'cost', 'likely', 'due', 'fact', 'distributors', 'wanted', 'keep', 'original', 'music', 'show', 'expense', 'disks', 'problem', 'apparently', 'slowed', 'halted', 'release', 'great', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'DVD', 'WKRP', 'Cincinnati', 'Apparently', 'producers', 'never', 'gave', 'much', 'thought', 'releasing', 'VHS', 'episdoes', 'were', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'so', 'are', 'now', 'stuck', 'huge', 'cost', 'royalties', 'needed', 'keep', 'original', 'music', 'played', 'series', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'excellent', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'original', 'music.Second', 'why', 'not', 'include', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'one', 'set', 'had', 'limited', 'number', 'shows', 'made', 'Cost', 'sited', 'reason', 'here', 'too', 'However', 'rumor', 'internet', 'Universal', 'will', 'release', 'set', 'seasons', 'time', 'end', 'year', 'as', 'soon', 'royalty', 'issue', 'can', 'be', 'worked', 'out', 'Supposedly', 'set', 'will', 'have', 'episode', 'commentary', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'features', ""'ll"", 'see.Regardless', 'issues', 'good', 'set', 'great', 'show', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'show', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'improved', 'immensely', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'concentrate', 'here.The', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Joel', 'Fleischman', 'exile', 'Alaska', 'fulfill', 'requirements', 'loan', 'put', 'med', 'school', 'reason', 'visit', 'Cicely', 'Alaska', 'However', 'series', 'builds', 'characters', 'situations', 'go', 'Joel', 'plight.Rob', 'Morrow', 'excellent', 'good', 'doctor', 'bringing', 'humor', 'desperation', 'character', 'thrown', 'unknown', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'eccentric', 'Maurice', 'Minnefield', 'astronaut', 'visionary', 'entrepreneur', 'perfection', 'Janine', 'Turner', 'Maggie', 'sexy', 'tough', 'John', 'Corbett', 'Chris', 'epitome', 'quirky', 'Cicelian', 'character', 'really', 'eclectic', 'tunes', 'radio', 'John', 'Cullum', 'terrific', 'Holling', 'Vincoeur', 'owner', 'best', 'tavern/restuarant', 'town', 'lover', 'cute', 'Shelly', 'Tambo', 'Cynthia', 'Geary', 'Geary', 'good', 'young', 'vixen', 'charmed', 'two', 'older', 'hearts', 'unusual', 'perspective', 'show', 'Darren', 'Burrows', 'young', 'native', 'American', 'Ed', 'solid', 'character', 'who', 'depth', 'scenes', 'featured', 'soul', 'Cicely', 'Elaine', 'Miles', 'novice', 'actor', 'lack', 'experiene', 'only', 'charm', 'character', 'Marilyn', 'Peg', 'Phillips', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'Ruth-Anne', 'first', 'realistic', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'grating', 'also', 'compassionate.It', 'interesting', 'see', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'disk', 'gag', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'priceless', 'show', 'cast', 'having', 'fun', 'show', 'was', 'unique', 'was', ""n't"", 'guaranteed', 'time', 'slot', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'rumors', 'are', 'true', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'wait', 'combined', 'set', 'are', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'finally', 'see', 'DVD', 'buy', 'now', 'enjoy', 'visit', 'Cicely']",N/A

600567,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00005JLG3,Tom Benton,"[14, 15]","The early 1990s saw a major public interest in the bizarrity of smalltown shows, clearly evidenced in three shows: TWIN PEAKS, PICKET FENCES, and NORTHERN EXPOSURE.  Each was very different and completely unlike anything on television before or after.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE was the lightest and most wacky of the bunch.  The series revolved around Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), a young New Yorker fresh out of medical school.  His tuition was paid by the state of Alaska, on the condition that Dr. Fleischman be stationed in Alaska after his graduation.  Expecting to be positioned in Anchorage, Fleischman happily accepts.  But to his immense dismay, he finds himself thrown into the middle of nowhere, also known as Cicely, Alaska, a town with a population of 215.  At first Fleischman wants nothing more than to escape from the bizarre town and its even more bizarre inhabitants, but as time goes on he comes to appreciate the town and the individuals living there.  Those individuals include cocky pilot Maggie O'Connell (Janine Turner), burly ex-NASA pilot and ""owner"" of the town Maurice J. Minnifield (Barry Corbin), amiable young aspiring filmmaker Ed (Darren E. Burrows), and peaceful early-morning radio DJ Chris Stevens (John Corbett).NORTHERN EXPOSURE is a show like no other.  The first season contains a mere 8 episodes, but is as charming as any series in history.  The simplicity of life in Cicely, the beauty of the scenery, the companionship between the town's inhabitants, fills one with love and warmth, and was no doubt a major factor in what made the show so attractive to viewers when it debuted in 1990.  The acting is wonderful all-around, the writing is witty and often absurd, and though the first season has not one dramatic scene, it's profoundly moving and irresistably enjoyable.  For TWIN PEAKS fans like myself, I warn that NORTHERN EXPOSURE has little in common with that show, although the fifth episode of this season contains a very silly and funny spoof of it.  Still I would highly recommend this show for anyone willing to try a new flavor of television.As for the DVDs, the NORTHERN EXPOSURE sets are probably the most infamous TV DVDs ever released.  On subsequent seasons, almost all music contained in the show was replaced with generic tunes (save for the theme).  I personally find this despicable, but Universal has no intention of re-releasing the seasons with the original music at the moment.  Season one, however, contains all the original music.  The picture and sound quality are excellent, and the menus are very nice.  It can be a little confusing to watch the series in order, however, as the first side of disc 1 actually contains the second batch of episodes, and the episodes are not numbered, nor is there any booklet for easy navigation through the season.  I recommend tv.com for a chronological episode listing.  Lastly, the packaging.  Consumers have complained about the parka packaging used for the first two seasons, but I myself believe it is the most charming and wonderful TV-DVD packaging ever.  I absolutely adore it, and I'm very sad that Universal did not continue doing this for the rest of the series.  Nevertheless, this is a fine set, and it's better to have a lightly toyed-with release of the series than none whatsoever.",5,Delightfully odd first season in an equally odd DVD package,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,3302,"['early', '1990s', 'saw', 'major', 'public', 'interest', 'bizarrity', 'smalltown', 'shows', 'clearly', 'evidenced', 'three', 'shows', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'PICKET', 'FENCES', 'NORTHERN', 'EXPOSURE', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'completely', 'anything', 'television', 'NORTHERN', 'EXPOSURE', 'was', 'lightest', 'most', 'wacky', 'bunch', 'series', 'revolved', 'Dr.', 'Joel', 'Fleischman', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'young', 'New', 'Yorker', 'medical', 'school', 'tuition', 'was', 'paid', 'state', 'Alaska', 'condition', 'Dr.', 'Fleischman', 'be', 'stationed', 'Alaska', 'graduation', 'Expecting', 'be', 'positioned', 'Anchorage', 'Fleischman', 'happily', 'immense', 'dismay', 'thrown', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'also', 'known', 'Cicely', 'Alaska', 'town', 'population', '215', 'first', 'Fleischman', 'nothing', 'more', 'escape', 'bizarre', 'town', 'even', 'more', 'bizarre', 'inhabitants', 'time', 'appreciate', 'town', 'individuals', 'living', 'there', 'individuals', 'include', 'cocky', 'pilot', 'Maggie', ""O'Connell"", 'Janine', 'Turner', 'burly', 'ex-NASA', 'pilot', 'owner', 'town', 'Maurice', 'J.', 'Minnifield', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'amiable', 'young', 'aspiring', 'filmmaker', 'Ed', 'Darren', 'E.', 'Burrows', 'peaceful', 'early-morning', 'radio', 'DJ', 'Chris', 'Stevens', 'John', 'Corbett', '.NORTHERN', 'EXPOSURE', 'show', 'other', 'first', 'season', 'mere', '8', 'episodes', 'as', 'charming', 'series', 'history', 'simplicity', 'life', 'Cicely', 'beauty', 'scenery', 'companionship', 'town', 'inhabitants', 'one', 'love', 'warmth', 'was', 'doubt', 'major', 'factor', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'attractive', 'viewers', 'when', 'debuted', '1990', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'all-around', 'writing', 'witty', 'often', 'absurd', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'one', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'irresistably', 'enjoyable', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'fans', 'warn', 'NORTHERN', 'EXPOSURE', 'little', 'common', 'show', 'fifth', 'episode', 'season', 'very', 'silly', 'funny', 'spoof', 'Still', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'anyone', 'willing', 'try', 'new', 'flavor', 'television.As', 'DVDs', 'NORTHERN', 'EXPOSURE', 'sets', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'infamous', 'TV', 'DVDs', 'ever', 'released', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'almost', 'music', 'contained', 'show', 'was', 'replaced', 'generic', 'tunes', 'save', 'theme', 'personally', 'find', 'despicable', 'Universal', 'intention', 're-releasing', 'seasons', 'original', 'music', 'moment', 'Season', 'one', 'however', 'original', 'music', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'menus', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'confusing', 'watch', 'series', 'order', 'however', 'first', 'side', 'disc', '1', 'actually', 'second', 'batch', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'numbered', 'there', 'booklet', 'easy', 'navigation', 'season', 'recommend', 'tv.com', 'chronological', 'episode', 'listing', 'Lastly', 'packaging', 'Consumers', 'have', 'complained', 'parka', 'packaging', 'used', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'believe', 'most', 'charming', 'wonderful', 'TV-DVD', 'packaging', 'ever', 'absolutely', ""'m"", 'very', 'sad', 'Universal', 'did', 'not', 'continue', 'doing', 'rest', 'series', 'Nevertheless', 'fine', 'set', 'better', 'have', 'lightly', 'toyed-with', 'release', 'series', 'none', 'whatsoever']",N/A
