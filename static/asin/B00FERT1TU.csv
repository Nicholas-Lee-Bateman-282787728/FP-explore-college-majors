1671394,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,B00FERT1TU,Bob L,"[3, 3]","For ten years I begged TCM to play You Never Can Tell but with no success. Finally, this classic screwball animal-lovers' fantasy has its DVD release. As with many of the other greats this might go out print before too long as Ball of Fire, Little Murders, They Might Be Giants, et cetera all have done so get yours copy of YNCT while you can. It's the story of King, a retired military German Shepherd (our side), who is willed a vast fortune and given plucky Peggy Dow as an executor. King has a thing for Peggy. Life is idyllic until an old nemesis shows up. This movie is unique. The copy, though not perfect, is good enough to not raise any objections. Dick Powell is, as always, delightful and so is this movie.",5,All but forgotten classic is back but for how long?,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,717,"['ten', 'years', 'begged', 'TCM', 'play', 'Never', 'Can', 'Tell', 'success', 'Finally', 'classic', 'screwball', 'animal-lovers', 'fantasy', 'DVD', 'release', 'many', 'other', 'greats', 'might', 'go', 'out', 'print', 'too', 'long', 'Ball', 'Fire', 'Little', 'Murders', 'Might', 'Be', 'Giants', 'et', 'cetera', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'get', 'yours', 'copy', 'YNCT', 'can', 'story', 'King', 'retired', 'military', 'German', 'Shepherd', 'side', 'who', 'willed', 'vast', 'fortune', 'given', 'plucky', 'Peggy', 'Dow', 'executor', 'King', 'thing', 'Peggy', 'Life', 'idyllic', 'old', 'nemesis', 'up', 'movie', 'unique', 'copy', 'not', 'perfect', 'good', 'enough', 'not', 'raise', 'objections', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'always', 'delightful', 'so', 'movie']",You Never Can Tell

Fortunately, she won't have to wait another 40+ years to see it again.The only drawback of this DVDR is that the print used was not in the greatest shape. I have bought many of the MOD movies and have been very happy with all of them, but the one used here is a little darker than most and with a lot of speckling throughout. The sound was fine, but for a 'B' movie of this caliber, I really wish they would have found a better print.The bottom line is that I'm very happy just to be able to watch this film again, anytime I want.I would love to see this movie connect with a newer generation and become better known.It truly deserves it.",5,A great fantasy for the entire family,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,1310,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'wonderful', 'one-of-a-kind', 'film', 'family', 'enjoy', 'then', 'look', 'further', 'Never', 'Can', 'Tell', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'funny', 'fantasies', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'up', 'beautifully', 'years.I', 'was', 'happy', 'when', 'learned', 'movie', 'was', 'finally', 'getting', 'DVD', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'DVDR', 'just', 'get', 'out', 'already.I', 'watched', 'family', 'day', 'arrived', 'everyone', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'especially', '8', 'year', 'old', 'granddaughter.I', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'TV', 'back', 'late', '60s', 'had', ""n't"", 'forgot', 'joyful', 'impact', 'had', 'so', 'what', 'delight', 'granddaughter', 'had', 'same', 'reaction', 'Fortunately', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', '40+', 'years', 'see', 'only', 'drawback', 'DVDR', 'print', 'used', 'was', 'not', 'greatest', 'shape', 'have', 'bought', 'many', 'MOD', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'happy', 'one', 'used', 'here', 'little', 'darker', 'most', 'lot', 'speckling', 'sound', 'was', 'fine', 'B', 'movie', 'caliber', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'better', 'print.The', 'bottom', 'line', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'anytime', 'want.I', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'movie', 'connect', 'newer', 'generation', 'become', 'better', 'known.It', 'truly']",You Never Can Tell
1671396,ASOOB05TT45H7,B00FERT1TU,Edmund J. Lachmann,"[9, 10]","""You Can Never Tell"" is a one-of-a-kind dog and pony detective tale that is as heartwarming and joyful as anything Frank Capra ever directed.  Director Lou Breslow, best known for his work with the Three Stooges, in in rare form here.  This is one of those delightful films you caught once on TV and fell in love with immediately.  I only wonder what took them so long to put it out.  The synopsis above is sufficient to inform the uninitiated and let them begin a riotous romp in what must be one of the most charming films ever concocted.  For me, it is one of those ""holy grail"" movies that I have been searching for for decades.
