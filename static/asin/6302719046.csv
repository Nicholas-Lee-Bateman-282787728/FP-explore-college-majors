329191,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302719046,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Ned Kelly, 1970 filmEdward `Ned' Kelly was a famous Australian outlaw in the 19th century, comparable to Jesse James in the USA. The film starts with a flashback to a wedding, then the advice of his Mom: ""Die like a Kelly"". The condemned man is led to the gallows in a prison. ""Such is Life"" is his last words. The story begins in 1871 when he served three years for stealing a horse. Afterwards he returns to his wife and children. Others arrive. ""They will never get me again"" says Ned. ""We're the Kelly's."" People dance to show their exuberance and happiness. People get in trouble when their cattle graze on another man's land. Boxing is another entertainment on a Sunday afternoon. A steam engine saws wood. They find a shorthorn bull and notify the owner. It is different in America where all men are equal. [Is this still true today?]A man sings ""The Wild Colonial Boy"", a saga about 19th century Australia. But there is trouble afterwards. Ned Kelly is arrested and taken to the Beechworth Court House and fined 2. A horse has strayed into another man's land. Will there be a fine? There is another song: ""Daddy makes his living in the evening"". Can painting a horse disguise its description? What happens when it rains? The Kelly boys are known to the police. One family member coughs, as if from tuberculosis (a poor diet). A Constable visits the family to bring a man back to town. Later more troopers arrive to invade the Kelly home. Mother Kelly gets three years! Will they take the Kelly brothers? There is another song about what happened next. ""Cold blooded murder."" Ned Kelly and his brothers are outlaws with a 2,000 price! Can a letter explain their actions? Not if it is censored in the press.The Kelly Gang goes into bank robbery next. Are they guilty of other crimes as well? Ned Kelly explains his actions to a group of people. Will his letter be published? No, his friends are all arrested. They rob a bank and burn the mortgages! Popular resentment of the authorities means no one will help the police. Kelly wants to start a People's Republic of Victoria! The troopers will use native trackers to find the Kelly gang; will it work? Its just a matter of time. Ned Kelly plans to use armor in combat, like Medieval Knights. But Ned sees Aaron with the Troopers. He plans to destroy railroad tracks for maximum damage.That informer collects his last payoff. They drink ""To The Republic"". Can the imprisoned people warn the train? Time passes. That train travels at night. One man waves a lantern to warn the train the train; it stops. There is shooting. Rockets are launched as a signal. Will this be a trap? The police arrive to free the captives (the usual warnings). Dawn arrives, the police wait for reinforcements. ""They're coming!"" Will that armor work? Ned Kelly is captured and tried. Bad treatment causes ban men. The judge doffs a black cap to sentence Kelly to hanging.Using a popular singer to star in a story about 19th century life can be compared to some western movies of the 1930a and 1940s. These stories were about economic and political repression by a big landowner against the small ranchers or homesteaders. Would the good guys win? Sometimes. How reliable is this story? The often darkened scenes subtract from the enjoyment of this movie. I doubt if bank robbers would have political ambitions, as shown here. The phrase ""People's Republic"" seems anachronistic.",3,The Wild Colonial Boy,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,3409,"['Ned', 'Kelly', '1970', 'filmEdward', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'was', 'famous', 'Australian', 'outlaw', '19th', 'century', 'comparable', 'Jesse', 'James', 'USA', 'film', 'flashback', 'wedding', 'then', 'advice', 'Mom', 'Die', 'Kelly', 'condemned', 'man', 'led', 'gallows', 'prison', 'Such', 'Life', 'last', 'words', 'story', '1871', 'when', 'served', 'three', 'years', 'stealing', 'horse', 'Afterwards', 'wife', 'children', 'Others', 'arrive', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'again', 'Ned', ""'re"", 'Kelly', 'People', 'dance', 'show', 'exuberance', 'happiness', 'People', 'get', 'trouble', 'when', 'cattle', 'graze', 'man', 'land', 'Boxing', 'entertainment', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'steam', 'engine', 'saws', 'wood', 'find', 'shorthorn', 'bull', 'notify', 'owner', 'different', 'America', 'where', 'men', 'are', 'equal', '[', 'still', 'true', 'today', ']', 'man', 'Wild', 'Colonial', 'Boy', 'saga', '19th', 'century', 'Australia', 'trouble', 'afterwards', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'arrested', 'taken', 'Beechworth', 'Court', 'House', 'fined', '2', 'horse', 'strayed', 'man', 'land', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'fine', 'song', 'Daddy', 'living', 'evening', 'Can', 'painting', 'horse', 'disguise', 'description', 'What', 'when', 'Kelly', 'boys', 'are', 'known', 'police', 'One', 'family', 'member', 'coughs', 'tuberculosis', 'poor', 'diet', 'Constable', 'family', 'bring', 'man', 'back', 'town', 'Later', 'more', 'troopers', 'arrive', 'invade', 'Kelly', 'home', 'Mother', 'Kelly', 'three', 'years', 'take', 'Kelly', 'brothers', 'song', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'Cold', 'blooded', 'murder', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'brothers', 'are', 'outlaws', '2,000', 'price', 'Can', 'letter', 'explain', 'actions', 'Not', 'censored', 'press.The', 'Kelly', 'Gang', 'bank', 'robbery', 'next', 'Are', 'guilty', 'other', 'crimes', 'well', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'actions', 'group', 'people', 'Will', 'letter', 'be', 'published', 'No', 'friends', 'are', 'arrested', 'rob', 'bank', 'burn', 'mortgages', 'Popular', 'resentment', 'authorities', 'one', 'will', 'help', 'police', 'Kelly', 'start', 'People', 'Republic', 'Victoria', 'troopers', 'will', 'use', 'native', 'trackers', 'find', 'Kelly', 'gang', 'will', 'work', 'just', 'matter', 'time', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'use', 'armor', 'combat', 'Medieval', 'Knights', 'Ned', 'Aaron', 'Troopers', 'destroy', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'maximum', 'damage.That', 'last', 'payoff', 'drink', 'Republic', 'Can', 'imprisoned', 'people', 'warn', 'train', 'Time', 'train', 'travels', 'night', 'One', 'man', 'lantern', 'warn', 'train', 'train', 'shooting', 'Rockets', 'are', 'launched', 'signal', 'Will', 'be', 'trap', 'police', 'arrive', 'free', 'captives', 'usual', 'warnings', 'Dawn', 'police', 'wait', 'reinforcements', ""'re"", 'coming', 'Will', 'armor', 'work', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'captured', 'tried', 'Bad', 'treatment', 'ban', 'men', 'judge', 'black', 'cap', 'sentence', 'Kelly', 'hanging.Using', 'popular', 'singer', 'star', 'story', '19th', 'century', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'western', 'movies', '1930a', '1940s', 'stories', 'were', 'economic', 'political', 'repression', 'big', 'landowner', 'small', 'ranchers', 'homesteaders', 'Would', 'good', 'guys', 'win', 'Sometimes', 'How', 'reliable', 'story', 'often', 'darkened', 'scenes', 'subtract', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'doubt', 'bank', 'robbers', 'would', 'have', 'political', 'ambitions', 'shown', 'here', 'phrase', 'People', 'Republic', 'anachronistic']",N/A

However, the thing that kept this movie from being a great film was the choice of Mick Jagger to play Ned Kelly himself. What were they thinking? Was it for the name recognition? To get a certain demographic into the movie theater? I've never watched a movie where the other actors are literally acting AROUND the lead as if he were a block of wood. It's not so much that he overracts as he UNDERACTS.  Even those actors with minor parts stand out in camparison. The movie will be proceeding well, drawing you into the plight of the Irish settlers of Australia, the high-handedness of British law enforcement, then... WHAM! Everything comes to a screeching halt again as Jagger mouths his lines in what I think is supposed to be an Irish brogue. Jagger's out-of-touch acting style and his weird accent makes you think that maybe he's a bit slow. He is unconvincing as the leader of a gang as he seems to be the kind of person you wouldn't follow if you were bored, much less if your life depended upon it.

329204,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,6302719046,Silver Screen Videos,"[0, 0]","At first glance, it would appear that having Rolling Stones bad boy Mick Jagger play the legendary Australian bad boy Ned Kelly would be perfect casting, especially in a movie directed by Tony Richardson, who won an Oscar for showcasing the exploits of an earlier bad boy of sorts, Tom Jones. Unfortunately, neither Jagger nor Richardson was up to the task and ""Ned Kelly"" pretty much sinks like a stone.The real life Kelly was a colorful and controversial character who, much like American counterparts such as Jesse James and Billy the Kid, was hailed as a hero by some and vilified by others. The movie pretty much portrays him as a Robin Hood type, who winds up (along with his brothers) gradually getting involved in a life of crime after first trying to protest the treatment of small farmers and ranchers by the wealthy ranchers. At first, he and his brothers start out small, primarily stealing horses, but, after they kill some of the policemen that are pursuing them, they find themselves hunted by the British police force with large bounties on their heads. In retaliation, they pull off ever more grandiose robberies, endearing themselves to the citizenry by burning the mortgages held by the banks they rob.As written in this movie, the role of Kelly requires an actor with a lot of roguish charm (a young Errol Flynn would have been perfect), but for whatever reason, Jagger downplays the role far too much. Part of this is due to his physical appearance. His face is puffed out and he sports an incredibly silly looking beard, making him appear more like a dinner theater version of Friar Tuck than a dangerous bandit. The only emotion he projects in the film is a bland sweetness, unbecoming both Jagger the actor and Kelly the character.What should have been the high point of the film is a bizarre final confrontation between the gang and the police. Kelly and the other gang members dress themselves in full body armor, with helmets, appearing like medieval knights in a planned ambush of a police train. Instead, the police had been tipped off and instead lay siege to the building where the gang was holed up. These historical events would seem a natural for a suspenseful, action filled climax, but Richardson's pace is lethargic, much of the action is difficult to make out at night, and the final takedown of Kelly plays out much like the Black Knight sequence in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.The movie's only real saving grace is the soundtrack. Jagger himself only contributes one song, an Irish folk tune his character sings in one scene. However, the movie contains a number of ballads written by Shel Silverstein and sung by Waylon Jennings (with accompaniment by Kris Kristofferson). It seems like a bizarre choice of tunes, but they are highly effective. Silverstein's lyrics, as sung by Jennings, describe a lot of what happens in the lengthy time gaps that the rather rudimentary screenplay does not cover. The songs often play as a rather ironic counterpoint to some of the scenes that appear on the screen, so much so that it appears that Richardson decided to match his action to the various ballads.""Ned Kelly"" (the film, not the man) would be completely forgotten today if not for the presence of Mick Jagger. However, once audiences satisfy their curiosity about Jagger, they realize that he isn't doing a particularly compelling job in the role and that the film is largely dramatically inert without any typical Western action to liven it up. DVD fans will also be displeased to note that the widescreen presentation is not anamorphic. The movie is actually worth listening to for the Waylon Jennings soundtrack contributions, but it's not worth watching, despite the presence of Mick Jagger.",2,Guilty As Charged,1400803200,"05 23, 2014",2014,3737,"['first', 'glance', 'would', 'appear', 'having', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'bad', 'boy', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'play', 'legendary', 'Australian', 'bad', 'boy', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'casting', 'especially', 'movie', 'directed', 'Tony', 'Richardson', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'showcasing', 'exploits', 'earlier', 'bad', 'boy', 'sorts', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'Unfortunately', 'Jagger', 'Richardson', 'was', 'up', 'task', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'pretty', 'much', 'sinks', 'stone.The', 'real', 'life', 'Kelly', 'was', 'colorful', 'controversial', 'character', 'who', 'much', 'American', 'counterparts', 'such', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'was', 'hailed', 'hero', 'vilified', 'others', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'type', 'who', 'up', 'brothers', 'gradually', 'getting', 'involved', 'life', 'crime', 'first', 'trying', 'protest', 'treatment', 'small', 'farmers', 'ranchers', 'wealthy', 'ranchers', 'first', 'brothers', 'start', 'small', 'primarily', 'stealing', 'horses', 'kill', 'policemen', 'are', 'pursuing', 'find', 'hunted', 'British', 'police', 'force', 'large', 'bounties', 'heads', 'retaliation', 'pull', 'ever', 'more', 'grandiose', 'robberies', 'endearing', 'citizenry', 'burning', 'mortgages', 'held', 'banks', 'rob.As', 'written', 'movie', 'role', 'Kelly', 'actor', 'lot', 'roguish', 'charm', 'young', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'reason', 'Jagger', 'role', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Part', 'due', 'physical', 'appearance', 'face', 'puffed', 'out', 'sports', 'incredibly', 'silly', 'looking', 'beard', 'making', 'appear', 'more', 'dinner', 'theater', 'version', 'Friar', 'Tuck', 'dangerous', 'bandit', 'only', 'emotion', 'projects', 'film', 'bland', 'sweetness', 'unbecoming', 'Jagger', 'actor', 'Kelly', 'character.What', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'bizarre', 'final', 'confrontation', 'gang', 'police', 'Kelly', 'other', 'gang', 'members', 'dress', 'full', 'body', 'armor', 'helmets', 'appearing', 'medieval', 'knights', 'planned', 'ambush', 'police', 'train', 'Instead', 'police', 'had', 'been', 'tipped', 'off', 'instead', 'lay', 'siege', 'building', 'where', 'gang', 'was', 'holed', 'up', 'historical', 'events', 'would', 'seem', 'natural', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'filled', 'climax', 'Richardson', 'pace', 'lethargic', 'much', 'action', 'difficult', 'make', 'out', 'night', 'final', 'takedown', 'Kelly', 'out', 'much', 'Black', 'Knight', 'sequence', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail.The', 'movie', 'only', 'real', 'saving', 'grace', 'soundtrack', 'Jagger', 'only', 'one', 'song', 'Irish', 'folk', 'tune', 'character', 'sings', 'one', 'scene', 'However', 'movie', 'number', 'ballads', 'written', 'Shel', 'Silverstein', 'sung', 'Waylon', 'Jennings', 'accompaniment', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'bizarre', 'choice', 'tunes', 'are', 'highly', 'effective', 'Silverstein', 'lyrics', 'sung', 'Jennings', 'lot', 'what', 'lengthy', 'time', 'gaps', 'rather', 'rudimentary', 'screenplay', 'not', 'cover', 'songs', 'often', 'play', 'rather', 'ironic', 'counterpoint', 'scenes', 'appear', 'screen', 'so', 'much', 'Richardson', 'decided', 'match', 'action', 'various', 'ballads', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'film', 'not', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'today', 'not', 'presence', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'However', 'once', 'audiences', 'satisfy', 'curiosity', 'Jagger', 'realize', ""n't"", 'doing', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'job', 'role', 'film', 'largely', 'dramatically', 'inert', 'typical', 'Western', 'action', 'liven', 'up', 'DVD', 'fans', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'displeased', 'note', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'not', 'anamorphic', 'movie', 'actually', 'worth', 'listening', 'Waylon', 'Jennings', 'soundtrack', 'contributions', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'presence', 'Mick', 'Jagger']",N/A
329205,A2AWDAJOV50842,6302719046,"Zendicant Penguin ""Zendicant Penguin""","[3, 5]","It came as a shock to see Mick Jagger's visage staring out from the dvd case of this movie but it also immediately raised my suspicions.  For, as big as the Rolling Stones are, if the movie had been any good certainly it would be well-known.  I suspect that any play this now gets is by people curious to see Jagger act.Ned Kelly is an Australian outlaw hero who has taken on mythic proportions.  If you spend any time around Australians (males, anyway) it is a sure bet that Ned Kelly's name will come up at some point, often in relation to his use of boiler plate armor to fight off the law.  That's about all I know about him but his is a romantic story begging to be put on film.This attempt falls flat for any number of reasons, yet the look and feel of the movie should be commended and alert viewers to the beauty of many of the movies made in the 1960's and 70's; the look of which aren't or can't be duplicated using today's modern methods.  It's not what the director intended, I'm sure, but watching this movie made me nostalgic to go back and watch Peckinpah and Sturges, among others.The real problem with this movie is that the script is crap, as is much of the acting, including Jagger's; although, he is still fun to watch.  The writers fail to supply a narrative that pushes the story forward in a logical manner.  Rather than dialogue the actors are given single lines which, because they are mostly mere responses or interjections do nothing to tell the story.  This might have worked if the visual narrative stood in for the lack of real dialogue (Anyway, real dialogue would have been difficult to understand beneath the thick Hollywood brogues).  Instead the movie is comprised of scenes stitched together in a kind of incoherent moving picture mural.The soundtrack doesn't help unless you like Country music, that is, and I mean 1970's style Country rather than the Country Pop of today.The music isn't poorly done, even if not to my liking, but it turns the mood of the movie into a sort of Irish Republican allegory.  One suspects this was intentional as the troubles in Northern Ireland had begun to flare up around the time of this movie.  I'm not sure if the actors were in on it but it seems pretty difficult to misapprehend today.This movie is recommended only to people who want to look at Mick Jagger.",1,I blame the director/writer more than anything for this poor effort.,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,2333,"['came', 'shock', 'see', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'visage', 'staring', 'out', 'dvd', 'case', 'movie', 'also', 'immediately', 'raised', 'suspicions', 'as', 'big', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'are', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'good', 'certainly', 'would', 'be', 'well-known', 'suspect', 'play', 'now', 'people', 'curious', 'see', 'Jagger', 'act.Ned', 'Kelly', 'Australian', 'outlaw', 'hero', 'who', 'taken', 'mythic', 'proportions', 'spend', 'time', 'Australians', 'males', 'anyway', 'sure', 'bet', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'name', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'point', 'often', 'relation', 'use', 'boiler', 'plate', 'armor', 'fight', 'off', 'law', 'know', 'romantic', 'story', 'begging', 'be', 'put', 'film.This', 'attempt', 'flat', 'number', 'reasons', 'look', 'feel', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'alert', 'viewers', 'beauty', 'many', 'movies', 'made', '1960', '70', 'look', 'are', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'duplicated', 'using', 'today', 'modern', 'methods', 'not', 'what', 'director', 'intended', ""'m"", 'sure', 'watching', 'movie', 'made', 'nostalgic', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'Peckinpah', 'Sturges', 'others.The', 'real', 'problem', 'movie', 'script', 'crap', 'much', 'acting', 'including', 'Jagger', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'writers', 'fail', 'supply', 'narrative', 'story', 'forward', 'logical', 'manner', 'Rather', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'are', 'given', 'single', 'lines', 'are', 'mostly', 'mere', 'responses', 'interjections', 'do', 'nothing', 'tell', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'visual', 'narrative', 'stood', 'lack', 'real', 'dialogue', 'Anyway', 'real', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'understand', 'thick', 'Hollywood', 'brogues', 'Instead', 'movie', 'comprised', 'scenes', 'stitched', 'together', 'kind', 'incoherent', 'moving', 'picture', 'mural.The', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'help', 'like', 'Country', 'music', 'mean', '1970', 'style', 'Country', 'rather', 'Country', 'Pop', 'today.The', 'music', ""n't"", 'poorly', 'done', 'even', 'not', 'liking', 'mood', 'movie', 'sort', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'allegory', 'One', 'was', 'intentional', 'troubles', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'had', 'begun', 'flare', 'up', 'time', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'actors', 'were', 'pretty', 'difficult', 'misapprehend', 'today.This', 'movie', 'recommended', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'look', 'Mick', 'Jagger']",N/A
