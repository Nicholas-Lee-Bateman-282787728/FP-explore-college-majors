Only Renee Zellweger can play this role, she is wickedly fabulous as larger than life Bridget. Renee looks adorable all chubby and curvy, she is too thin in real life, I like her body in these movies. The second one is just as good as the first one. Bridget gets herself arrested and still has boyfriend trouble but this time with new beau, Mark played by Colin Firth. Hugh Grant returns to his role of Daniel Cleaver, he is even a bigger wanker in this one, I love to hate him. I love the scene where Bridget thinks she is pregnant ( funny dream sequence!).

629560,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B00005JNDZ,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[27, 33]","I don't usually review films that I only saw by chance and then didn't like, but I'm making an exception here, as ""Bridget Jones  - The Edge of Reason"" is a true disaster all round. I saw the first movie and found it mildly amusing, so when this turned up I thought I'd give it a go, but I'm sorry I bothered.Basically, the Bridget Jones in this film is a total idiot, who messes up everything in her life including her pride, her love life, and her career. Not in a funny or endearing way, though, which would encourage sympathy. And not in a zany Lucille Ball-type way either, that would get you laughing. No, just in a totally stupid and pointless way that makes you want to hit her. Every embarrassing  faux-pas or misunderstanding the character stumbles through (and there are dozens) just makes you want to switch off and leave her to it. She messes up every single aspect of her relationship, her job, and her holiday by saying and doing the most brainless and unfathomable things, in ways that a real person would never do. Or if they did, they wouldn't have any friends...and certainly not Hugh Grant and Colin Firth fighting over them!Rene Zellweger playes Bridget as a totally unloveable, boring and socially inept loser...I don't think this is the actress's fault, or even due to the original charcter in the Helen Fielding novels, but more due to the terrible script and direction. Why does Bridget walk everwhere like a constipated duck, for example? Why does she laugh and sigh at every stupid blunder she makes, and just waddle on to the next stumbling point? Even when she's lost the love of her life, it's all summed up with a shrug and a rueful smile. Come on, girl, try and make us care! I sure didn't!If that wasn't bad enough, the last third of the movie almost made me shout at the screen...Dopey Bridget is duped into smuggling a massive stash of cocaine out of Thailand, and gets caught trying to board a plane at Bangkok airport. She then gets thrown into a Thai women's prison. This notoriously unpleasant predicament really doesn't belong in a (supposedly) frothy comedy like this is, but it just gets worse, as have-a-go Bridget gets all (and I mean ALL) the inmates on her side which results in a  huge sing-along scene and lots of laughing and hugging. Sorry, I don't think so somehow. This sugar-coated representation of the notoriously brutal Thai prison regime left a nasty taste in my mouth...not alleviated in the slightest when Bridget gets an anticipated (but blatently unlikely) full pardon and early release, just because her lawyer boyfriend pulls the right strings.The above illustration is the worst example, but I didn't find any of Bridgets other antics entertaining or affecting in the slightest either. She's somehow got a high profile TV reporters job, but she can't even do it. Everyone makes jokes about her weight and she just thinks it's funny. With a central and supporting cast of usually reliable performers, it's tragic how lame this film has turned out. There's nothing apparent to make you understand or care about any of the lead characters actions. And that means a waste of 90 minutes in my book. Make better use of your time and give this one a miss.",1,This is total rubbish.,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,3212,"['do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'review', 'films', 'only', 'saw', 'chance', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', ""'m"", 'making', 'exception', 'here', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'true', 'disaster', 'round', 'saw', 'first', 'movie', 'found', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'so', 'when', 'turned', 'up', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'go', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'bothered.Basically', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'film', 'total', 'idiot', 'who', 'up', 'everything', 'life', 'including', 'pride', 'love', 'life', 'career', 'Not', 'funny', 'endearing', 'way', 'would', 'encourage', 'sympathy', 'not', 'zany', 'Lucille', 'Ball-type', 'way', 'would', 'get', 'laughing', 'No', 'just', 'totally', 'stupid', 'pointless', 'way', 'want', 'hit', 'embarrassing', 'faux-pas', 'misunderstanding', 'character', 'are', 'dozens', 'just', 'want', 'switch', 'off', 'leave', 'up', 'single', 'aspect', 'relationship', 'job', 'holiday', 'saying', 'doing', 'most', 'brainless', 'unfathomable', 'things', 'ways', 'real', 'person', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'did', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'friends', 'certainly', 'not', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'fighting', 'Rene', 'Zellweger', 'Bridget', 'totally', 'unloveable', 'boring', 'socially', 'inept', 'loser', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actress', 'fault', 'even', 'due', 'original', 'charcter', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'novels', 'more', 'due', 'terrible', 'script', 'direction', 'Why', 'Bridget', 'walk', 'everwhere', 'constipated', 'duck', 'example', 'Why', 'sigh', 'stupid', 'blunder', 'just', 'waddle', 'next', 'stumbling', 'point', 'Even', 'when', 'lost', 'love', 'life', 'summed', 'up', 'shrug', 'rueful', 'smile', 'Come', 'girl', 'try', 'make', 'care', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'almost', 'made', 'shout', 'screen', 'Dopey', 'Bridget', 'duped', 'smuggling', 'massive', 'stash', 'cocaine', 'Thailand', 'caught', 'trying', 'board', 'plane', 'Bangkok', 'airport', 'then', 'thrown', 'Thai', 'women', 'prison', 'notoriously', 'unpleasant', 'predicament', 'really', ""n't"", 'belong', 'supposedly', 'frothy', 'comedy', 'just', 'worse', 'have-a-go', 'Bridget', 'mean', 'inmates', 'side', 'results', 'huge', 'sing-along', 'scene', 'lots', 'laughing', 'hugging', 'Sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'somehow', 'sugar-coated', 'representation', 'notoriously', 'brutal', 'Thai', 'prison', 'regime', 'left', 'nasty', 'taste', 'mouth', 'not', 'alleviated', 'slightest', 'when', 'Bridget', 'anticipated', 'blatently', 'unlikely', 'full', 'pardon', 'early', 'release', 'just', 'lawyer', 'boyfriend', 'right', 'strings.The', 'illustration', 'worst', 'example', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Bridgets', 'other', 'antics', 'entertaining', 'affecting', 'slightest', 'either', 'somehow', 'got', 'high', 'profile', 'TV', 'reporters', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'Everyone', 'jokes', 'weight', 'just', 'funny', 'central', 'supporting', 'cast', 'usually', 'reliable', 'performers', 'tragic', 'how', 'lame', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'nothing', 'apparent', 'make', 'understand', 'care', 'lead', 'characters', 'actions', 'waste', '90', 'minutes', 'book', 'Make', 'better', 'use', 'time', 'give', 'one', 'miss']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason
629561,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JNDZ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 8]","Something happened between this film and the original that I just cannot put my finger on. Was it the actors feeling like they were too comfortable in their roles? Maybe. Was it the unchallenging story that fell too clearly into a clich&eacute;d moment than a fun film? Maybe. Was it the random exploits of our character that pulled us away from her and into a world that we were unfamiliar with? Maybe. Was it the lackluster music that filled my ears with pain instead of enjoyment? Maybe. It could possibly be one of these options or all of them, but when I walked out of the theater, I didn't feel the same excitement as I did when I walked out of the theater for the first one. Bridget had changed (or maybe it was me, but for the sake of argument I will say Bridget), and it wasn't for the better.Let me explain my four points from above a bit clearer to see if anyone can help me discover what went wrong in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. First, the comfort level of the actors. To begin, did Renee look bigger in this film. In the first film she was plump-cute, in this film she seems just plump-plump. She seemed to just stroll through her lines not giving us half the emotion or excitement as she did in the original. Instead of building upon Bridget Jones, Zellweger just gave us a recycled version of the original Bridget Jones, jokes and all. She was just the same as the original. Nothing new was created, but more was destroyed. Firth was equally as bad (GASP for me to say that), but he just never came out of his shell. In the original I wanted Jones to be with him by the end and in this film I just didn't care. He felt and seemed cold-hearted, even in all of his emotional moments. I wanted his character to be over-the-top instead of under-the-weather. Finally, there was Hugh Grant, so literally just didn't care about this film at all. There was no passion in his eyes or any magic in his words. Together this troupe made an unfunny film where they attempted to pull everything back from the original. The book was not the same as the original, so why should this be?This leads me into my second point regarding the unchallenging story. It seemed and felt as if Zellweger was falling her paces instead of leading her character. The events that surrounded her seemed so surreal that I never really felt as if they were happening to her. Somewhere near the center of this film we go from personal story to fantasy. The fact that the director could only tell us with Darcy did for Jones proved that money and creativity were lacking in this sequel. The director obviously did not have a very good grasp on this film, and it was obvious from the beginning to the end. The entire Rebecca moments were laughable and unemotional. I needed a dramedy instead of a silly-goofy film. Who felt as if the fight between Darcy and Cleaver was two men looking to get paid instead of act. Why was this scene even in this film? I can tell you why, it is because women love Firth and Grant fighting and the studio executives wanted to pull those same women back into the audience. Well, couldn't we be more original and find someone else to fight? Apparently not as we are forced to uncomfortably sit through two hours of repetitive motions that we had already seen from the original. URG!Third and I know this is something that we probably couldn't avoid because it was in the book, but the change of scenery was pointless. I like Jones in her environment, London, it allows her humor to come from inside instead of from her 'wacky' expeditions. The ski trip moment was horrible. I even felt awkward throughout it. It just showed me that there was more money and more ability to travel. Did anyone else seem to notice that the prison seemed awfully glossed over? This is built another level to disappointment that I was already feeling from this film. Why did we have to butcher a great character with sight gags? Bridget Jones is not a sight gag person, it is her uncanny passion that makes her funny, not putting her butt in pig feces.Finally, there was the music. In the original the music complimented the film. In Edge of Reason, it only detracts us from the film. It is the most random chaotic choices encountered in a film. From classic oldies to modern pop, Bridget Jones changed before my own eyes as a wanna-be music video and platform for those that want to get ahead. If it was going to be a repetitive film like the first was, where was 'It's Raining Men'. That would have at least made me chuckle. Instead, there was some American-ized Christina Aguleria/Pink wanna-be blasting her song in this very British film. Chalk this one up to yet another disaster brought about by this director. Did she even see the original? The music failed in this sequel, causing a distressed viewer run back and rewatch the original.Overall, this was a horrible remake. Jen seemed to feel the same, but still found it enjoyable to purchase when it is released. I felt as if there was something missing. Bridget Jones is not one that needs to change for a new generation, and I felt this is what director Beeban Kidron did. She tried to make her perkier, plumper, and hipper. Bridget Jones is a character that is supposed to speak to women in the audience by her awkward behavior and passion for love, but instead what I witnessed (and I think the women will agree) was an actress packing on more weight than needed to gain the sympathy of anyone in the audience. She put no emotion behind her character, nor did anyone else involved. This felt like a painful sequel, and it was obvious that nobody was fully behind it.Grade: ** out of *****",2,"If you love her so much Darcy, why don't you marry her?",1101513600,"11 27,

629565,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00005JNDZ,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[1, 1]","Oh how we love to cry ""not as good as the first movie"", but in truth very few movie sequels capture the freshness, or spirit of an often inventive and new idea like an original. Sadly, that is also the case here when comparing the first and infinitely better Bridget Jones Diary, but there are a few saving graces to make this at least mildy entertaining. The story picks up 4 weeks after the end of the first movie (although 3 years have elapsed in real time) and we find ALL the main characters reprising their roles. Bridget is still oozing the giddy romance and, likeably bumbling naivety of a 30 something schoolgirl, alongside Colin Firth's stoic, but gentlemanly romantic lawyer Darcy, and all seems well despite some nagging incompatibility issues between the two. The clash of class cultures between them continues (albeit in some very contrived scenarios) until doubt, envy and the adjustment of two single lifers suddenly sharing, looks set to send things off the rails. Enter at this point dashing bad boy Hugh Grant as Daniel, stirring up old memories, and mixed emotions, and conveniently now working for the same TV company as Bridget and we are set hopefully for some light entertainment. Problem however, is that none of the engaging aspects of Bridgets character from the first movie, or the concern or sympathy that were previously generated is here, and most of the original cast (nice to see as they are) are just minimally sprinkled in the plot for the purpose of continuity without any real inclusion. I kept asking myself why a sequel was necessary (as I often do, despite the obvious money spinning aspect) when the first picture was so complete, making this a reheating of old material to a large extent. There is enough charm to keep the picture moving, and the characters are all played excellently, but the script is limp overall, some parts being often less than funny completely (especially the Thai prison scenes). The occasional nice dialogue and one-liners try but fail to lift this picture out of the doldrums, and the cringe aspect of most of the embarassing situations Bridget falls into is painful at times.

The sequal, however, was the opposite.The film begins nearly right where the first left off, which was a plus, for so many of us were curious to see where the romance of the heroine, Bridget, and her new beax, Mark Darcy, would lead. It quickly loses steam and SENSE from then on. Why?  Gone are the ""insightful"" reflections of Bridget that lead us to care about her in the film.  In its place are a few ill-matched diary-esque insights amidst a series of odd (a Thai prison, are you kidding me?) situations or the stereotypical social scene (Mark's lawyer's ball).  In an effort to make us laugh, Bridget is thrown out of plane, a ski lift, and is subjected to drugs, water puddles, and hair and make-up mishaps.  Also missing was the clever infiltration of Bridget's parents (they have a very minor role this time) who really livened up the first film.

But that's okay, since the movie was great the first time around, I don't mind seeing some of the same stuff again. This time around, we join Bridget, as she's right in the middle of her relationship with sexy lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). She's still at her TV job, making a fool of herself (remember the hilarious fireman's pole thing from the first??!! Similar situation in this one...).Bridget is getting worried because it seems that Mark might have a love interest at work. Of course, Bridget is just jumping to all the wrong conclusions. She gets pretty low, then gets a job to go to Thailand and film a sort of tourist guide. Guess who is working there too? And at the same job and company because her boss told her that they needed a male personality? That's right. Daniel (Hugh Grant). Unlike Mark, Daniel really is a skeez. Will she go back with Daniel, who feeds her compliments and tells her what a fool he's been? Or will she get back with Mark? Obvious answer. The movie got a little weird for me (I actually thought she had to be dreaming at first because I couldn't believe it) when Bridget is sent to a Thai prison. Yeah.Overall, though, this is a funny movie.

That's the same reason there's a second BRIDGET JONES book, and there's nothing wrong with using that justification to make a movie.However, BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON departs from what made the first film so charming, instead concentrating on the goofball slapstick of Bridget, rather than her inherent ""Everywoman"" quality that made her so relatable.Lots of women know what it's like to be stood up for a date or to be lied to by a cad. Hardly any women or other members of the target audience for BRIDGET JONES know what it's like to be under arrest and held in a Thai women's prison. (I also doubt, in that situation, that most women would spend their time choreographing a Madonna number for fellow inmates.) Other women likely aren't going to accidentally end up skiing down a championship racing slope. Or skydive into a vat of pig slop. Or get into another of the groan-inducingly unrealistic situations that the makers of the film put Bridget in.The movie's not like the second novel, either, which has its own set of flaws. The second novel didn't even include the Daniel Cleaver character, but the movie had to find a way to include Hugh Grant - so they threw him in there.The problems of the romance between Darcy and Bridget, like in the book, could be solved if the two of them just sat down and had an open conversation. But, instead, we're treated to the situation - and the movie AND Renee Zellweger's wavering accent - just getting worse and worse.That said, the romance is interesting. Colin Firth is good.

Bridgette is a revolting, wanton, fat, stupid woman doing her best to somehow replicate on the silver screen the fatuous feats that one might have done in childhood. The story is pointless.

She says infantile things on the phone to her boyfriend and does all she can to be as outrageously facile as possible in public.  The jokes are stale and any purpose is completely lacking.The film devolves into a series of scenes documenting how irritating she is. One is forced to put up with that tragically common English expression shag' again and again. The `shags' her bloke, her friends and old boyfriends all `shag', and she has `shag flashbacks'. It is all drivel and unbearable dross. She is a modern nightmare. I failed, I guess, to see the point. Is she supposed to be the defiant voice of the disenfranchised women in modern England?

629574,A14QAT1XDSCLEO,B00005JNDZ,Bitcetc,"[133, 151]","So many sequels, so little time. Should you spend some of that time with this sequel to the popular and funny Bridget Jones' Diary? If you have a taste for the light and frothy, certainly.  If we were discussing the book, The Edge of Reason, I would say ""no""--- there are far better books, and better sequels, out there. But this is that rare case where the second book was rushed out to capitalize on the wild popularity of the first, and disappointing----- while this movie, not so rushed, is only casually based on and certainly better than the book.Although neither book nor movie quite live up to the first, fans of the first movie will be well entertained by the second. And I, for one, am immensely glad that at least one horribly painful scene in the book is not even hinted at in the movie: Mr. Darcy keeps most of his dignity intact.Can you enjoy this movie without seeing the first Diary? Yes, you learn enough of the characters early that this movie can stand on its own. However, I would bet that if you even smile during this one, you will want to rent or buy the first. You'll laugh out loud.Especially if you love Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, as I do, this sequel is time well spent. I can't spell out why Colin Firth is so attractive, but there it is: he is. He is a much greater presence in this movie than the first--- after all, he (as ""Mark Darcy"") and Bridget have a real relationship as the movie opens. Of course they ---uhmm--- ""mess"" it up (""language, Bridget!"") with misunderstandings, jealousies, and very funny mishaps. I am not a huge fan of humor based on one character's running the continuum from private embarrassment to public humiliation; yet Bridget, who constantly manages to embarrass herself and others in public, is such a good sport and so charming as Everygirl, that we laugh or groan with her in recognition of those moments in ourselves, and not at her. There are some great laughs in this movie.Some of them come with Hugh Grant, who seems to have lost the weight that Renee Zellweger gained. Too thin but still devilishly attractive, Hugh's rakish character Daniel Cleaver hangs around to take advantage of the misunderstandings between Bridget and Mark Darcy-- even if he has to ""hang around"" Thailand to do it. Cad that he is, when Bridget really becomes a damsel in distress, he evaporates into thin air. That's all right. We know there will be some rough times in between, but surely Mark Darcy, human rights lawyer, will come cantering in on a white horse to save Bridget from Thai prison, right? Not quite. But with a few comic kinks, close enough.I don't expect Renee Zellweger to receive another Oscar nomination for this one. She is fun, she is appealing, and she is good, but this is not the script for it. I've heard the British objections to her inconsistent, not to say hokey, accent, and while they have some merit here, I do applaud her for bravely diving into Everygirl-dom, a little overweight, a little embarrassed and embarrassing, but with self-awareness enough to make her a cult favorite of all of us ""Singletons"". She's effervescent, and she's resilient. Gotta love her.If the movie was shot on location, it largely lost the advantage of it in Thailand, but that is a mere quibble. A stronger criticism: the first movie's soundtrack was marvelously energetic and witty--- who could forget ""It's Raining Men""? This one, however, tries too hard: too many oldies which are favorites because they are very good songs,  but which have been used in too many soundtracks.

But here there were so many requirements lacking that I nearly nodded off. A plot would've been nice (instead of wandering around from a skydiving incident to a jail in Thailand); I don't consider a ""misunderstanding"" about a woman a viable plot device. Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth, whom I thought had a sparky relationship in the first film, have been turned into screenplay robots, reading their lines as if directly from the page.The only saving grace in the story was Hugh Grant (and believe me, I'm not a huge Hugh Grant fan). When he finally showed up in the picture he immediately added some much needed dialogue-infused comedy to the story. And he delivered his lines as if he MEANT them.The sad part for me, too, is that I really like Mrs. Zellweger and Mr. Firth as actors. Renee was excellent in the musical ""Chicago""; and Mr. Firth's crowning achievement (""Pride and Prejudice"") has yet to be rivaled for a period piece in my humble opinion.I feel that this film was simply a money-grab by the movie studio, trying to benefit off of the success of its predecessor ...and failing miserably.",2,Over the Precipice,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,1208,"['Edge', 'Reason', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'here', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'requirements', 'lacking', 'nearly', 'nodded', 'off', 'plot', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'instead', 'wandering', 'around', 'skydiving', 'incident', 'jail', 'Thailand', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'misunderstanding', 'woman', 'viable', 'plot', 'device', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'whom', 'thought', 'had', 'sparky', 'relationship', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'screenplay', 'robots', 'reading', 'lines', 'directly', 'page.The', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'story', 'was', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'believe', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'fan', 'When', 'finally', 'showed', 'up', 'picture', 'immediately', 'added', 'much', 'needed', 'dialogue-infused', 'comedy', 'story', 'delivered', 'lines', 'MEANT', 'them.The', 'sad', 'part', 'too', 'really', 'Mrs.', 'Zellweger', 'Mr.', 'Firth', 'actors', 'Renee', 'was', 'excellent', 'musical', 'Chicago', 'Mr.', 'Firth', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'yet', 'be', 'rivaled', 'period', 'piece', 'humble', 'opinion.I', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'money-grab', 'movie', 'studio', 'trying', 'benefit', 'success', 'predecessor', 'failing', 'miserably']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

I hadn't, but I was filled in on the background before it began, and references were explained to me.Basically, it's a romance involving an insecure fat girl (Renee Zellweger) and the two men who are competing for her affection. She is in love with an human rights lawyer (Colin Firth) whom she has been with for two whole months but finds herself occasionally drawn to a funny, charming, but ultimately slimy TV show host (Hugh Grant.)I couldn't for the life of me figure out why anyone would be fighting over this woman. She's an idiot. She constantly humiliates Firth's character in front of his professional colleagues. She is completely inept at nearly everything. And none of this is even remotely cute or endearing. Conversely, I couldn't understand what she saw in her boyfriend, who has all the personality of the desk I'm sitting at. Oh, right, the shagging was good. We are reminded of that many, many times over. Grant's character is a jerk, but at least he's funny.Zellweger is incredibly annoying, with her fake English accent and exaggerated mannerisms. Roger Ebert says he wanted to tickle her under her chin. I wanted to punch her in the eye.  Do women actually relate to this character?  That's so very sad.Hugh Grant is the only entertaining thing in the movie. His scenes were the only times I genuinely laughed.The film is nauseatingly sweet at the worst of times, and predictable as well. If you can't see what's coming when someone asks the main character to carry a souvenir item from Thailand in her luggage, then you just haven't seen enough movies. By the time Bridget is singing Madonna songs in a Thai prison, you'll be wanting to ram skewers into both your eyes and ears.This isn't the worst film I've ever seen, but it is unquestionably the worst film I've seen in theaters in the past year.",2,Insufferable chick flick,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,1922,"['got', 'dragged', 'hideous', 'feature', 'two', 'female', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'loved', 'first', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'was', 'filled', 'background', 'began', 'references', 'were', 'explained', 'me.Basically', 'romance', 'involving', 'insecure', 'fat', 'girl', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'competing', 'affection', 'love', 'human', 'rights', 'lawyer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'whom', 'been', 'two', 'whole', 'months', 'occasionally', 'drawn', 'funny', 'charming', 'ultimately', 'slimy', 'TV', 'show', 'host', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'could', ""n't"", 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'fighting', 'woman', 'idiot', 'constantly', 'Firth', 'character', 'front', 'professional', 'colleagues', 'completely', 'inept', 'nearly', 'everything', 'none', 'even', 'remotely', 'cute', 'endearing', 'Conversely', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'saw', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'personality', 'desk', ""'m"", 'sitting', 'Oh', 'right', 'shagging', 'was', 'good', 'are', 'reminded', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'Grant', 'character', 'jerk', 'least', 'funny.Zellweger', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'fake', 'English', 'accent', 'exaggerated', 'mannerisms', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'wanted', 'tickle', 'chin', 'wanted', 'punch', 'eye', 'Do', 'women', 'actually', 'relate', 'character', 'so', 'very', 'sad.Hugh', 'Grant', 'only', 'entertaining', 'thing', 'movie', 'scenes', 'were', 'only', 'times', 'genuinely', 'laughed.The', 'film', 'nauseatingly', 'sweet', 'worst', 'times', 'predictable', 'as', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'coming', 'when', 'someone', 'main', 'character', 'carry', 'souvenir', 'item', 'Thailand', 'luggage', 'then', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'enough', 'movies', 'time', 'Bridget', 'singing', 'Madonna', 'songs', 'Thai', 'prison', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wanting', 'ram', 'skewers', 'eyes', 'ears.This', ""n't"", 'worst', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'unquestionably', 'worst', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'theaters', 'past', 'year']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

That is the question posed by this movie, ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"". Renee Zellweger is back in the main role as Bridget Jones in this continuation of the original Bridget Jones from 2001. And this time around, she is forced to choose between her new lover, Mark, and her former lover, Daniel.This movie is the type that most will find agreeable enough to give it a chance, but it isn't as loaded with laughs as some viewers will hope. I found only a couple of scenes funny, and I started to wonder why the movie was billed as a romantic comedy. It is really more dramatic than humorous, and many of the attempts at humor are tired and worn out- the type of humor you hear over and over again in movies.I didn't care much for the storyline of this movie, mainly because it is so ordinary. How many times have we seen a movie like this- one that portrays a woman who is torn between two men, feels jealous about the new guy, but is still attracted in a strange way to the former lover, even though he has betrayed her trust in the past? It is the same old formula from Hollywood that we have grown to expect, but would like to see changed.I like the performances of the three main characters; Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant. They all bring a certain degree of charm to their respective roles and they all seem believable, although it is difficult to look at Hugh Grant as a bad guy. He just doesn't have a nasty- enough look to fulfill this role, even if his bad reputation is because of dishonesty in relationships.Overall, this is a decent flick, and those who enjoyed the first Bridget Jones will probably like this one too.

She was someone women could relate to and perhaps laugh at her flightiness and in turn make the rest of us feel better that we are not in her shoes. However, watching the film version of Bridget Jones: The Edge or Reason was like watching a parody of the aforementioned anti-heroine. Almost every scene in the sequel centers on Bridget Jones going through humiliating moments that are too over the top at times. There were some poignant and sweet moments with Bridget and Mark Darcy, but they were few and far in between. The plot also seems bloated, like the editors tried to add as many elements of the book as possible in 110 minutes. And the solution regarding relationship interloper Rebecca is too contrived and simplified for my taste. Also, the elements of Jane Austen's Persuasion that were in the book are missing here.  What happened?  The first book had been inspired by Austen's Pride and Prejudice and said inspiration was also apparent in the movie.  This is yet another major flaw in this film. But despite the aforementioned things, the movie was indeed funny and entertaining and Renee Zellwegger (who gained more weight to do this film than she did in the first one) and gorgeous Colin Firth had great chemistry. Hugh Grant is always fun to watch whenever he plays a bad boy. Grant is more believable in the aforementioned roles than he is when he plays the boy next door type of characters he played in Notting Hill and Love Actually. All in all, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is not as good as the Helen Fielding novels or as good as the first movie and I'd advise you to rent the DVD before you buy it.",3,"Entertaining and funny, but very, very flawed...",1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,1783,"['What', 'loved', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'books', 'movie', 'most', 'was', 'fact', 'got', 'see', 'heroine', 'who', 'was', 'far', 'perfect', 'possible', 'aspect', 'was', 'someone', 'women', 'could', 'relate', 'perhaps', 'laugh', 'flightiness', 'turn', 'make', 'rest', 'feel', 'better', 'are', 'not', 'shoes', 'However', 'watching', 'film', 'version', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'was', 'watching', 'parody', 'aforementioned', 'anti-heroine', 'scene', 'sequel', 'centers', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'going', 'humiliating', 'moments', 'are', 'too', 'top', 'times', 'were', 'poignant', 'sweet', 'moments', 'Bridget', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'plot', 'also', 'bloated', 'editors', 'tried', 'add', 'many', 'elements', 'book', 'possible', '110', 'minutes', 'solution', 'regarding', 'relationship', 'interloper', 'Rebecca', 'too', 'contrived', 'simplified', 'taste', 'Also', 'elements', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Persuasion', 'were', 'book', 'are', 'missing', 'here', 'What', 'happened', 'first', 'book', 'had', 'been', 'inspired', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'said', 'inspiration', 'was', 'also', 'apparent', 'movie', 'yet', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'aforementioned', 'things', 'movie', 'was', 'indeed', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'who', 'gained', 'more', 'weight', 'do', 'film', 'did', 'first', 'one', 'gorgeous', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'whenever', 'bad', 'boy', 'Grant', 'more', 'believable', 'aforementioned', 'roles', 'when', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'type', 'characters', 'played', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Love', 'Actually', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'novels', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'movie', ""'d"", 'advise', 'rent', 'DVD', 'buy']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

629590,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005JNDZ,Craig MACKINNON,"[5, 6]","The first Bridget Jones movie was a perfect little human comedy.  Although absurdly unlucky, Bridget remained a consistent and logical (in her own way) centre to the film.  The humour grew organically from her ""logical"" reactions to the absurdity happening around her.  And we had a nice, romantic happy ending.  The same praise cannot be given to this sequel, ""Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason.""  Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the film in a superficial way, at least while I was watching it.  Unfortunately, it's entirely unecessary, except as a money-making grab by the studio.The plot: Mark Darcy is seen in the presence of another woman.  Bridget assumes he is cheating on her and is then assigned a job in Thailand with Daniel Cleaver (the ""ex"").  Therein lies the main problem I had with the film: the entire story is built on misunderstandings that could be cleared up with the tiniest application of logic on any one of the characters' parts.  Similarly, actions are not driven by the nature of the characters, but rather the requirements of the plot.  For example, almost immediately after starting the relationship with Mark Darcy, Bridget's friends are advising her to dump him.  Why?  I have no idea - I guess because the screenplay told them to!  Similarly, if Bridget is thrown in a Thai jail while on assignment for her TV network, wouldn't someone at that network notice that she had gone missing?Am I applying logic where none is required?  Probably.  But a sequel should be able to build on the characters rather than making them more two-dimensional (or making their actions arbitrary).  I should be asking is the film funny?  Are the actors good?  The answer to both questions is undeniably ""yes!""  I applaud the idea of building a comedy around the question, ""what happens after happily ever after?"" Unfortunately, the film bails and gives us a series of silly little scenes that work on their own, but never add up to anything worthwhile.On the plus side, Mirimax has deigned to give us at least a few extras on the DVD.  There are some deleted scenes, the most welcome being the infamous ""Bridget interviews Colin Firth"" scene from the novel.  Obviously, it became impossible to put this in the movie with Firth playing Mark Darcy, but they filmed it anyway at the end of a day's shooting and stuck it on the DVD as a treat to those who have read the book.

Moreover, her brain seems to have departed completely and she does things that are not only stupid but indicate that she doesn't learn anything from previous debacles, which is not the Bridget of the first movie.  Overall, the whole thing appears to be a group of not-very-funny pratfalls and idiotic scenes strung together without much rhyme or reason just to give us a second round of Bridget Does Thailand/ Ski Slope/ Elegant Dinner Party in hopes that we will bear her enough carried over good will to watch it.

629601,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B00005JNDZ,Dorrie Wheeler,"[2, 4]","Bridget Jones Diary-The Edge of Reason is a hilarious romantic comedy starring a slightly plumper Renee Zellwegger as the British Brigette Jones. At the beginning of the film, Bridget is at work totally on cloud 9 after a fantastic shagadellic session with her boyfriend. The shag session was so fantastic that the next day at work she has a shag flashback and decides to call him at work to tell him how absolutely fab he looks in the buff. She then realizes that she has paid him this compliment on speaker phone. Bridget has one mishap after another and this comedy will keep you laughing. Fans of the first Bridget Jones movie won't be disappointed in this sequel that is just as funny. The comedy in the film is slapstick and it does get annoying at times to see Bridget repeatedly make a fool out of herself but fans of the underdog heroine will be pleased with this film. Will Bridget find true love with Mark Darcy? Or does Daniel Cleaver hold the key to her heart? Or will she find true love at all? You have to watch the movie to find out.The DVD itself has some pretty cool extras. You have the option to watch the film with the quiz on or off. The bonus features are separated into three sections-""Daniel's Hotel Room,"" ""Bridget's Desk,"" and ""Mark's Law Office."" In Daniel's hotel room are the extras, ""Fight"" and ""Who's Your Man Quiz?"" ""Fight"" is commentary from cast members talking about the fight scene in the first movie and the sequel. ""Who's Your Man Quiz?"" is a fun interactive quiz. In Bridget's desk are the option to watch the feature film with director commentary and the option to watch deleted scenes with introductions. In the ""Mark's Law Office"" section is a featurette titled ""Mark and Bridget Forever,"" and an interview titled, ""Bridget Jones interviews Colin Firth."" This is interesting because Renee Zellweger interviews Colin Firth in character. Colin is in street clothes and they are talking about ""The real Colin Firth,"" not Mark Darcy. They talk about his filming ""Pride and Prejudice,"" among other things. The final featurette is titled, ""Lovely London."" In this feature they discuss how computer generation is used in filming some of the exterior shots.",4,"If You Liked The First One, You Will Like This One",1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,2192,"['Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary-The', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'hilarious', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'starring', 'slightly', 'plumper', 'Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'British', 'Brigette', 'Jones', 'beginning', 'film', 'Bridget', 'work', 'totally', 'cloud', '9', 'fantastic', 'shagadellic', 'session', 'boyfriend', 'shag', 'session', 'was', 'so', 'fantastic', 'next', 'day', 'work', 'shag', 'flashback', 'call', 'work', 'tell', 'how', 'absolutely', 'buff', 'then', 'paid', 'compliment', 'speaker', 'phone', 'Bridget', 'one', 'mishap', 'comedy', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'Fans', 'first', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'sequel', 'just', 'funny', 'comedy', 'film', 'slapstick', 'get', 'annoying', 'times', 'see', 'Bridget', 'repeatedly', 'make', 'fool', 'herself', 'fans', 'underdog', 'heroine', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'film', 'Will', 'Bridget', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'hold', 'key', 'heart', 'will', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out.The', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'cool', 'extras', 'have', 'option', 'watch', 'film', 'quiz', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'separated', 'three', 'sections-', 'Daniel', 'Hotel', 'Room', 'Bridget', 'Desk', 'Mark', 'Law', 'Office', 'Daniel', 'hotel', 'room', 'are', 'extras', 'Fight', 'Who', 'Man', 'Quiz', 'Fight', 'commentary', 'cast', 'members', 'talking', 'fight', 'scene', 'first', 'movie', 'sequel', 'Who', 'Man', 'Quiz', 'fun', 'interactive', 'quiz', 'Bridget', 'desk', 'are', 'option', 'watch', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'commentary', 'option', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'introductions', 'Mark', 'Law', 'Office', 'section', 'featurette', 'titled', 'Mark', 'Bridget', 'Forever', 'interview', 'titled', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'interviews', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'interesting', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'interviews', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'character', 'Colin', 'street', 'clothes', 'are', 'talking', 'real', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'not', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'talk', 'filming', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'other', 'things', 'final', 'featurette', 'titled', 'Lovely', 'London', 'feature', 'discuss', 'how', 'computer', 'generation', 'used', 'filming', 'exterior', 'shots']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

One painfully uncomfortable situation in which Bridget wears too-tight underclothing. One embarrassing on-the-job snafu in which Bridget lands on her butt. One equally embarrassing occasion in which Bridget goes to tell Mark Darcy she loves him, in front of a crowd of people. One gorgeous, tall coworker at Mark Darcy's law firm. Sounds familiar? You saw it the first time around in Bridget Jones; you'll see it again in Edge of Reason.When Edge of Reason opens, Bridget Jones is 33, and not single- rather, having a wonderful relationship with her boyfriend of six weeks, Mark Darcy. Everything seems to be going well... until her friends put a seed of doubt into her mind that Mark might be cheating on her. Bridget is painfully insecure about her relationship, and Mark treats her as though she's a child sometimes, especially when she attempts to break into his house during a firm meeting. Why, oh why can't Bridget just be happy with the way things are, and trust Mark?Added into the mix is Daniel Cleaver, now working as a travel guide for the same TV station that Bridget works for, incidentally. She hates him- but then the two are sent on a trip to Thailand together. Cleaver becomes the ultimate cad when Bridget discovers that he ordered a Thai prostotute to his room for the evening, and when he neglects to save her from being arrested. Mark Darcy, predictably, comes to her rescue. There are very few redeeming things about this movie; as other people have said, its basically a remake of the original. Although there are some very funny bits, we've already seen it all before.

Maybe not, but its a charming, funny and very sweet movie.  All the characters you love are back, the 2 boyfriends, her family and her friends (though I still feel the friends should get more airtime).There are many cringeworthy moments, never better than when she gets arrested (I wont give anything away) and the film doesn't let up.  I literally giggled and belly laughed from start to finish.  There are many 'moments' - the Thai 'Like A Virgin' prison scene for exmaple is hilarious. The acting is excellent, and the best performance without a doubt is from Hugh Grants caddish character! Brilliantly wicked.My criticism of the first Bridget Jones, was that it was so 'twee', it portrayed the Uk in that postcard perfect image, which it certainly isn't (eg: London looking beautiful during the Christmas snowfall - the reality is black slush and hardly any snow at Christmas anyway!), and whilst there are a couple of moments like that this time round, its not so prevalent.

629618,ABDP7XNFF65PM,B00005JNDZ,Jeanette Armstrong,"[1, 2]","First let me say, I loved the first Bridget Jones' Diary. All the characters in the original movie were just too funny and charming in so many ways. They each held their own. I can't help watching it over and over again laughing at the same things each time. It was very well done.The problem I have with this second movie is Bridget herself. One of the things I was counting on was for Bridget to be a bit more mature and not finding herself in situations that totally embarrassed her and Mark. You would think she would have developed a bit more sophistication, if for no other reason but to understand that she is now finding herself in Mark's inner circle. I found it very hard to watch most of this movie due to her total idiocy! Not only that, she looks like she is another twenty pounds heavier on top of the weight she had in the first movie. In other words, she looked and acted worse in this movie than the first. I understand some of the situations she found herself in, but seriously I think the producers painted her in such a bad light that it bordered on the rediculous.The supporting cast did a great job continuing their rolls in this movie, but for the most part it was just one mishap after another one. I was so hoping that this second movie would also develop Bridget and Mark's relationship (courtship) a bit more, for after all, that is what we all want to see. The first movie ended in such a great uplifting way that I would have like to see that carried on to this one, but it seemed to go down hill instead, and not for any particular reason except for misunderstandings by Bridget herself. I'm sure that was, to some extent, the whole purpose of the movie was to have things go so wrong that their love was to be tested. But, really, it was just too much. This movie was sorely lacking in their having a romantic relationship that you would have thought they would have built on after the end of the first movie.The end was somewhat predicable, but at least it worked. Obviously, there probably won't be a third movie, and that's too bad. There were some laughs in this movie, but for most of it, you had to feel totally embarrassed for Mark. Like I said earlier, I was sadden that  Bridget, herself, looked so bad in this one, that it makes you wonder what on earth Mark sees in her now.",3,Rather disappointed,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,2316,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'loved', 'first', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'characters', 'original', 'movie', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'funny', 'charming', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'held', 'own', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'laughing', 'same', 'things', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done.The', 'problem', 'have', 'second', 'movie', 'Bridget', 'One', 'things', 'was', 'counting', 'was', 'Bridget', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'mature', 'not', 'finding', 'situations', 'totally', 'embarrassed', 'Mark', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'developed', 'bit', 'more', 'sophistication', 'other', 'reason', 'understand', 'now', 'finding', 'Mark', 'inner', 'circle', 'found', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'most', 'movie', 'due', 'total', 'idiocy', 'Not', 'only', 'twenty', 'heavier', 'top', 'weight', 'had', 'first', 'movie', 'other', 'words', 'looked', 'acted', 'worse', 'movie', 'first', 'understand', 'situations', 'found', 'seriously', 'think', 'producers', 'painted', 'such', 'bad', 'light', 'bordered', 'rediculous.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'continuing', 'rolls', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'mishap', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'hoping', 'second', 'movie', 'would', 'also', 'develop', 'Bridget', 'Mark', 'relationship', 'courtship', 'bit', 'more', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'first', 'movie', 'ended', 'such', 'great', 'uplifting', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'see', 'carried', 'one', 'seemed', 'go', 'down', 'hill', 'instead', 'not', 'particular', 'reason', 'misunderstandings', 'Bridget', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'extent', 'whole', 'purpose', 'movie', 'was', 'have', 'things', 'go', 'so', 'wrong', 'love', 'was', 'be', 'tested', 'really', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'having', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'built', 'end', 'first', 'movie.The', 'end', 'was', 'somewhat', 'predicable', 'least', 'worked', 'Obviously', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'third', 'movie', 'too', 'bad', 'were', 'laughs', 'movie', 'most', 'had', 'feel', 'totally', 'embarrassed', 'Mark', 'said', 'earlier', 'was', 'sadden', 'Bridget', 'looked', 'so', 'bad', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'earth', 'Mark', 'now']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason
629619,AI1VD7QWKM0V1,B00005JNDZ,Jessica Winney,"[9, 10]","What happened?  Everything that was great about the first movie went terribly wrong in this one.  The first Bridget Jones film was centered on Bridget and Mark Darcy ""finding"" each other, sorting out their misconceptions, and ultimately falling in love.  It is a modern re-telling of the core plot of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice: Girl meets guy at party, guy makes disparaging remark to girl, girl spends majority of film (and miniseries) disliking guy, is briefly deceived by villain (Daniel Cleaver, or in the case of P&P;, Mr. Wickham), and eventually realizes guy is truly her perfect match.  And to top it all off, girl and guy share passionate kiss at the end of the film (and the miniseries).  Great formula, right?  And then came the second movie...Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is supposed to depict the aftermath, or the ""happily ever after"" that in this case turns out not to go so ""happily.""  Bridget and Mark Darcy have already been together for a while at the start of the film, but all of the chemistry that they had in the first film is completely gone.  They seem almost estranged.  Mark Darcy is just as icy as he was in the first film, only now that he's got the girl, there's no excuse for it.  It just makes him seem closed off.  Bridget is even more insecure than she was in the first film and gets into even more scrapes, only they don't seem as funny this time around.  Instead of making her feel more secure, her relationship with Mark Darcy appears to have had the opposite effect.  She comes off more as a train wreck than as a delightfully accident prone single girl.  Even in their more intimate moments, they don't really seem like a couple (the ski slope scene in which Bridget realizes that she might be pregnant due to ""all the weeks of uninterrupted sex they've had"" begs the question, ""When, exactly?"").  I watched the film thinking, ""How did these two get together?""And then there's the plot.  Gone are the hilarious conversations between Bridget and her friends in the pub, and gone is the subplot involving Bridget's parents.  The parents are hardly featured in this film, and the friends only sporadically. Instead, we have Shazzer, Jed, cocaine, Thailand, way too much on-screen time with Daniel Cleaver, and a beautiful young lawyer who turns out to be a lesbian in love with Bridget.  Huh?  It's like one of those films where they just throw everything in together and take whatever emerges from the mess.  To make it even worse, the mood of the film is inconsistent.  It starts off attempting to be funny, then gets very dark after Bridget is imprisoned in Thailand on drug charges.  All of a sudden we've gone from comedy to drama, then back to comedy after she is released.  The film is a roller coaster, and in more ways than one.Overall, it is simply a bad sequel, as so many other sequels have been before it.  Stick to the first movie.  At least you'll still have the ""promise"" that something great will happen.",2,"""The Edge"" Is Right, More Like ""Way Over The Edge""",1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,2970,"['What', 'happened', 'Everything', 'was', 'great', 'first', 'movie', 'went', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'one', 'first', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'film', 'was', 'centered', 'Bridget', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'finding', 'other', 'sorting', 'out', 'misconceptions', 'ultimately', 'falling', 'love', 'modern', 're-telling', 'core', 'plot', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Girl', 'guy', 'party', 'guy', 'disparaging', 'remark', 'girl', 'girl', 'spends', 'majority', 'film', 'miniseries', 'disliking', 'guy', 'briefly', 'deceived', 'villain', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'case', 'P', 'P', 'Mr.', 'Wickham', 'eventually', 'realizes', 'guy', 'truly', 'perfect', 'match', 'top', 'off', 'girl', 'guy', 'share', 'passionate', 'kiss', 'end', 'film', 'miniseries', 'Great', 'formula', 'right', 'then', 'came', 'second', 'movie', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'supposed', 'depict', 'aftermath', 'happily', 'ever', 'case', 'out', 'not', 'go', 'so', 'happily', 'Bridget', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'together', 'while', 'start', 'film', 'chemistry', 'had', 'first', 'film', 'completely', 'gone', 'seem', 'almost', 'estranged', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'just', 'as', 'icy', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'only', 'now', 'got', 'girl', 'excuse', 'just', 'seem', 'closed', 'off', 'Bridget', 'even', 'more', 'insecure', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'scrapes', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'funny', 'time', 'around', 'Instead', 'making', 'feel', 'more', 'secure', 'relationship', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'have', 'had', 'opposite', 'effect', 'off', 'more', 'train', 'wreck', 'delightfully', 'accident', 'prone', 'single', 'girl', 'Even', 'more', 'intimate', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'couple', 'ski', 'slope', 'scene', 'Bridget', 'might', 'be', 'pregnant', 'due', 'weeks', 'uninterrupted', 'sex', ""'ve"", 'had', 'question', 'When', 'exactly', 'watched', 'film', 'thinking', 'How', 'did', 'two', 'get', 'together', 'then', 'plot', 'Gone', 'are', 'hilarious', 'conversations', 'Bridget', 'friends', 'pub', 'gone', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Bridget', 'parents', 'parents', 'are', 'hardly', 'featured', 'film', 'friends', 'only', 'sporadically', 'Instead', 'have', 'Shazzer', 'Jed', 'cocaine', 'Thailand', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'on-screen', 'time', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'beautiful', 'young', 'lawyer', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'lesbian', 'love', 'Bridget', 'Huh', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'just', 'throw', 'everything', 'together', 'take', 'emerges', 'mess', 'make', 'even', 'worse', 'mood', 'film', 'inconsistent', 'attempting', 'be', 'funny', 'then', 'very', 'dark', 'Bridget', 'imprisoned', 'Thailand', 'drug', 'charges', 'sudden', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'comedy', 'drama', 'then', 'back', 'comedy', 'released', 'film', 'roller', 'coaster', 'more', 'ways', 'one.Overall', 'simply', 'bad', 'sequel', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'sequels', 'have', 'been', 'Stick', 'first', 'movie', 'least', ""'ll"", 'still', 'have', 'promise', 'something', 'great', 'will', 'happen']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

In the first sequence of scenes, Bridget reports live as she parachutes from a plane into a pigpen's excremental bog. Consistent with this, her life is pretty much of a total disaster except for an ongoing affair with a high-powered amnesty lawyer, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), about whom she dreamily counts the days, hours and minutes of their relationship as well as the number of times they've &#34;shagged&#34;. The wildcards are Rebecca (Jacinda Barrett), Darcy's assistant, both elegant and gorgeous - attributes not to be associated with Jones - with whom Mark may also be dallying, and Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), an old boyfriend who still lusts after what's inside Bridget's &#34;giant panties&#34;.Bridget's engaging persona is established in BRIDGET JONES DIARY (2001). Though the original was perhaps a better film, neither it (nor this one) are the comedic fluff of which indelible cinematic memories are made. Therefore, by default and my failing memory, THE EDGE OF REASON must stand on its own merits. (Perhaps the two are best seen together when they're eventually released as a DVD set.) In any case, I've always had an objection to any appearance by Colin Firth, which always results in an on-screen character, in my opinion, totally devoid of charm or humor. Perhaps he reminds me to much of myself:&#62;) (Only in a 1996 film adaptation of Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE did this formula work for me.) Hugh Grant, here a charming rascal that could well be my alter ego, has only a subordinate role. Too bad.Bridget certainly has pluck, best depicted when, after being arrested in Bangkok for drug smuggling, she becomes the song coach and darling of a jail cell-full of Thai prostitutes . Ok, ok, that subplot was a bit of a stretch by the screenwriters, but it works for her. My biggest problem with Jones is that I can't see her in a romantic (or even prurient light), so her triangular relationship with Darcy and Cleaver remains, for me, unconvincing.

Tired, lacking the increasing maturity that one may expect from years added to a girl's journey through life and rushed into making an awful gaff.There is one scene which the writer and film maker will come to regret. Obviously based on a real life, recently the subject of a UK TV series 'Banged-up' overseas, now the subject of a harrowing autobiography and presumably an equally harrowing film to be. Being dumb enough to become an unwitting drug mule, the suggestion that a Bangkok women's jail could be fun is deeply disturbing. The forthcoming docudrama about Golden Gate suicides is already being criticised for the risk of encouraging such suicides. That film may be able to defend itself, but the Bridget Jones sequel cannot. It is on the edge of reason.Had the film makers included the scene cut but available on CD, then the Bangkok sequence may have been believable. However it is far too great a suspension of reality to believe that any government and international human rights lawyer, could remain in love with someone whose actions threatened  his career, self concept and family happiness.The book, the film could have been a 'great' and a great tear-jerker, if the plot had matured closer to reality.just Jack",2,It is the edge of reason,1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,1325,"['film', 'guess', 'book', 'suffers', 'being', 'sequel', 'what', 'was', 'unexpected', 'success', 'Tired', 'lacking', 'increasing', 'maturity', 'one', 'may', 'expect', 'years', 'added', 'girl', 'journey', 'life', 'rushed', 'making', 'awful', 'gaff.There', 'one', 'scene', 'writer', 'film', 'maker', 'will', 'come', 'regret', 'Obviously', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'recently', 'subject', 'UK', 'TV', 'series', ""'Banged-up"", 'overseas', 'now', 'subject', 'harrowing', 'autobiography', 'presumably', 'equally', 'harrowing', 'film', 'be', 'Being', 'dumb', 'enough', 'become', 'unwitting', 'drug', 'mule', 'suggestion', 'Bangkok', 'women', 'jail', 'could', 'be', 'fun', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'forthcoming', 'docudrama', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'suicides', 'already', 'being', 'criticised', 'risk', 'encouraging', 'such', 'suicides', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'defend', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'sequel', 'can', 'not', 'edge', 'reason.Had', 'film', 'makers', 'included', 'scene', 'cut', 'available', 'CD', 'then', 'Bangkok', 'sequence', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'believable', 'However', 'far', 'too', 'great', 'suspension', 'reality', 'believe', 'government', 'international', 'human', 'rights', 'lawyer', 'could', 'remain', 'love', 'someone', 'actions', 'threatened', 'career', 'concept', 'family', 'happiness.The', 'book', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', ""'great"", 'great', 'tear-jerker', 'plot', 'had', 'matured', 'closer', 'reality.just', 'Jack']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

But then that is what I would say about the first one too. Anyway, I liked this movie. The 3 main stars return: Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Actually everyone that was in the first one is in this one. Bridget Jones (Renee) hasn't changed much. She has a real boyfriend now, but she still smokes and drinks (not as much though). My only problem is Renee looked too overweight. She looked good in the first one, but this one she just gained too much for the role. Mark Darcy (Colin) in this movie is a combination of sexy, annoying, snobbish & a bit funny too.(similar to the first movie, but better). There are times in this movie that I just wanted to shake some sense into Mark. The movie: It takes place 6 weeks later from where the first one left off. Bridget and Mark are together. It is still very awkward between the 2 of them. He is the straight laced serious lawyer and she is the insecure tv reporter.  Daniel Clever (Hugh) is also back - still the same sexy scoundral as in the first movie. It has some funny parts, some that you laugh at just because that is you during that scene or situation and then there are some parts that really don't make sense. Like the first movie, there are areas that don't match if you read the book and then see the movie or vice versa. You are taken through quite a few situations from start to finish, but in the end it finishes like you want it to. It is a good movie to see if you are 1) wanting to see what happens from where the first movie left off & 2) wanting to completely forget your life for an hour and a 1/2.

629623,A1Y9HYZNBMMX4B,B00005JNDZ,"J. Wingard ""The Music Maven""","[2, 5]","Bridget Jones: The Edge of ReasonThis is no average romantic comedy. Strap yourself in for the riotous laughter that ensues in this comedy featuring the ever-talented Renee Zelleweger. Friends and enemies, old and new, throw in some truly unexpected twists and turns in this sequel to the extremely successful Bridget Jones' Diary. Watching the film is like catching up with an old friend. Scenes are put together like little vignettes drawn from her now infamous diary (which only makes one appearance in the film strangely enough). The filmmakers expect that you have seen the first one and are delivering fans all the Bridget they can handle. Viewers of the first film will feel as if they are on all the ""in"" jokes... as they play up all of Bridget's endearing neuroses... from her ""appalling bad public speaking"" to her relationship with the ""scary stomach holding-in panties popular with grannies the world over"".Colin Firth (Mark Darcy) is totally off the ""hot"" charts in playing the leading man. He lets it all hang out personality-wise and romantically in the Edge of Reason. If you're not swooning over him already, this film will certainly put you over the edge! And Mr. Cleaver (Hugh Grant) does not disappoint as the boyish cad that we all hate to love, or is it love to hate?The movie bets on its female fans having had a relationship with their own ""Daniel Cleaver"" and the scenes between Daniel and Bridget will make you squirm in your seat. Watching this movie is like being at a pajama party! You will laugh, squirm, yell and be driven to the edge of your seat and feel good doing it because so will everyone else in the theater. The movie is not so much about trials and tribulations of single-hood, it is about the pitfalls of the relationship decisions we make and how we can bond as women because of them. And this experience is reflected in the audience it brings together.Women bond with Bridget because they know what she is going through and fans will continue to enjoy that relationship with the new movie. That's half of what makes the scenes so downright hilarious (the other half is Zelleweger's comedic talent). As for the guys, don't worry, there's a scene at the end that will make it all worthwhile for them.What is lackluster about the film is that it is not as structured as the first, and Zelleweger starts it off a little weakly with a fuzzy accent in the beginning. Some fans might find that the smarminess subtracts from the experience and there is too much unfortunate mimicking of the original that came off a little forced. You won't really notice the relative lack of scene set up in this one because you will be too busy laughing and the filmmakers continue with some beautiful scenery and an excellent soundtrack.This movie has a hard time being at all serious but don't we all need a laugh (or two or three hundred) these days? The Edge of Reason is a must see for any true Bridget fan; it does not disappoint. It will take you to the edge of your seat and make you laugh like no other film this year. 4  stars.",5,The Edge of Reason brings you to the Edge of your Seat!,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,3058,"['Bridget', 'Jones', 'Edge', 'ReasonThis', 'average', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Strap', 'riotous', 'laughter', 'comedy', 'featuring', 'ever-talented', 'Renee', 'Zelleweger', 'Friends', 'enemies', 'old', 'new', 'throw', 'truly', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'sequel', 'extremely', 'successful', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'Watching', 'film', 'catching', 'up', 'old', 'friend', 'Scenes', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'like', 'little', 'vignettes', 'drawn', 'now', 'infamous', 'diary', 'only', 'one', 'appearance', 'film', 'strangely', 'enough', 'filmmakers', 'expect', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'one', 'are', 'delivering', 'fans', 'Bridget', 'can', 'handle', 'Viewers', 'first', 'film', 'will', 'feel', 'are', 'jokes', 'play', 'up', 'Bridget', 'endearing', 'neuroses', 'appalling', 'bad', 'public', 'speaking', 'relationship', 'scary', 'stomach', 'holding-in', 'panties', 'popular', 'grannies', 'world', '.Colin', 'Firth', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'totally', 'hot', 'charts', 'playing', 'leading', 'man', 'hang', 'out', 'personality-wise', 'romantically', 'Edge', 'Reason', ""'re"", 'not', 'swooning', 'already', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'put', 'edge', 'Mr.', 'Cleaver', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'not', 'disappoint', 'boyish', 'cad', 'hate', 'love', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'bets', 'female', 'fans', 'having', 'had', 'relationship', 'own', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'scenes', 'Daniel', 'Bridget', 'will', 'make', 'squirm', 'seat', 'Watching', 'movie', 'being', 'pajama', 'party', 'will', 'laugh', 'squirm', 'yell', 'be', 'driven', 'edge', 'seat', 'feel', 'good', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'everyone', 'else', 'theater', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'single-hood', 'pitfalls', 'relationship', 'decisions', 'make', 'how', 'can', 'bond', 'women', 'experience', 'reflected', 'audience', 'together.Women', 'bond', 'Bridget', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'fans', 'will', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'relationship', 'new', 'movie', 'half', 'what', 'scenes', 'so', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'other', 'half', 'Zelleweger', 'comedic', 'talent', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'scene', 'end', 'will', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'them.What', 'lackluster', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'structured', 'first', 'Zelleweger', 'off', 'little', 'weakly', 'fuzzy', 'accent', 'beginning', 'fans', 'might', 'find', 'smarminess', 'experience', 'too', 'much', 'unfortunate', 'mimicking', 'original', 'came', 'off', 'little', 'forced', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'relative', 'lack', 'scene', 'set', 'up', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'busy', 'laughing', 'filmmakers', 'continue', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'excellent', 'soundtrack.This', 'movie', 'hard', 'time', 'being', 'serious', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'laugh', 'two', 'three', 'hundred', 'days', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'must', 'see', 'true', 'Bridget', 'fan', 'not', 'disappoint', 'will', 'take', 'edge', 'seat', 'make', 'other', 'film', 'year', '4', 'stars']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

629627,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNDZ,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 4]","Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is the sequel to the popular Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) that conveys Bridget Jones' (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) most intimate thoughts and feelings in her diary.  This time the audience is introduced to her new diary, which opens with the happiness and joy that Bridget experiences through her love life.  Everything seems to be perfect, as her boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), a human rights lawyer, provides the most delicious escapades in the bedroom, at least according to Bridget, who willingly shares this with her diary and people she meets.  This sharing of secrets becomes a little repetitive as the film moves along.Preoccupation with obsessive dreaming of Mark affects her life, as she thoughtlessly steps into trouble and embarrassment.  This embarrassment further increases her already strong insecurities.  Insecurity then leads to situations where she begins to question Mark's honesty, loyalty, and love for her through assumptions that she makes based on information inflamed with jealousy.  She could be a poster child for insecurity, as she continuously questions Mark's integrity and in the end only hurts herself.In the middle of her predicaments regarding her relationship with Mark she once again meets the sly womanizer Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who is the anchor for a TV travel program called ""The Smooth Guide.""  The TV station that Bridget works for wants to make the program more accessible for a wider audience and suggests that she becomes a co-host on ""The Smooth Guide.""  Initially Bridget refuses, but as expected, she gives in.  Their first episode together is to be shot in Thailand, and Bridget brings one of her friends to help chaperone her.When they arrive in Thailand Daniel turns up his charm and tries to sway Bridget to give him a second chance, however, Bridget is cautious as she was once hurt before.  This happens while Bridget's friend hooks up with a younger man who asks her to bring home a gift from England when they are about to leave.  The nave Bridget thinks she is going to be helpful, but she has evidently never seen Bangkok Hilton (1989), Return to Paradise (1998), and Brokedown Palace (1999), which would make her a lot more cautious.  Just as in these other films there are drugs in the item that she is to bring to England, and she is sent to a Thai prison.  Who could help her get out of prison?  Well, that might not be a surprise to the audience, as they will see this film unfold.Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason delivers a cinematic experience full of obvious stereotypes that are turned into slapstick moments.  Furthermore, the film attempts to make fun of Bridget's lack of knowledge and insecurities, which occasionally work, but frequently lead into awkward and confusing moments where the audience does not know whether to feel sorry for Bridget or to laugh at her.  As if it was not enough, the film uses clich&eacute;s that have been seen in similar films many times before throughout several decades, and this enhances the predictability of the story.  Ultimately, this sequel falls way short of the accomplishments made in the initial film.As mentioned, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason falls short compared to the first film, yet the film has its funny moments.  Those who are Ren&eacute;e Zellweger fans might want to see this film, as her performance is actually remarkable.  However, overall this film is only a mediocre romantic comedy that is worth renting on an evening when the audience feels that they need to put things in perspective in regards to relationships and love.",3,Good Performance by Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in Ok Romantic Comedy...,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,3601,"['Bridget', 'Jones', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'sequel', 'popular', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', '2001', 'conveys', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'most', 'intimate', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'diary', 'time', 'audience', 'introduced', 'new', 'diary', 'happiness', 'joy', 'Bridget', 'love', 'life', 'Everything', 'be', 'perfect', 'boyfriend', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'human', 'rights', 'lawyer', 'most', 'delicious', 'escapades', 'bedroom', 'least', 'according', 'Bridget', 'who', 'willingly', 'shares', 'diary', 'people', 'sharing', 'secrets', 'little', 'repetitive', 'film', 'along.Preoccupation', 'obsessive', 'dreaming', 'Mark', 'life', 'thoughtlessly', 'trouble', 'embarrassment', 'embarrassment', 'further', 'already', 'strong', 'insecurities', 'Insecurity', 'then', 'situations', 'where', 'question', 'Mark', 'honesty', 'loyalty', 'love', 'through', 'assumptions', 'based', 'information', 'inflamed', 'jealousy', 'could', 'be', 'poster', 'child', 'insecurity', 'continuously', 'questions', 'Mark', 'integrity', 'end', 'only', 'herself.In', 'middle', 'predicaments', 'regarding', 'relationship', 'Mark', 'once', 'again', 'sly', 'womanizer', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'who', 'anchor', 'TV', 'travel', 'program', 'called', 'Smooth', 'Guide', 'TV', 'station', 'Bridget', 'make', 'program', 'more', 'accessible', 'wider', 'audience', 'co-host', 'Smooth', 'Guide', 'Initially', 'Bridget', 'expected', 'first', 'episode', 'together', 'be', 'shot', 'Thailand', 'Bridget', 'one', 'friends', 'help', 'chaperone', 'her.When', 'arrive', 'Thailand', 'Daniel', 'up', 'charm', 'tries', 'sway', 'Bridget', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'however', 'Bridget', 'cautious', 'was', 'once', 'hurt', 'before', 'Bridget', 'friend', 'up', 'younger', 'man', 'who', 'bring', 'home', 'gift', 'England', 'when', 'are', 'leave', 'nave', 'Bridget', 'going', 'be', 'helpful', 'evidently', 'never', 'seen', 'Bangkok', 'Hilton', '1989', 'Return', 'Paradise', '1998', 'Brokedown', 'Palace', '1999', 'would', 'make', 'lot', 'more', 'cautious', 'Just', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'drugs', 'item', 'bring', 'England', 'sent', 'Thai', 'prison', 'Who', 'could', 'help', 'get', 'prison', 'Well', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'surprise', 'audience', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'unfold.Bridget', 'Jones', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'delivers', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'full', 'obvious', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'turned', 'slapstick', 'moments', 'Furthermore', 'film', 'attempts', 'make', 'fun', 'Bridget', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'insecurities', 'occasionally', 'work', 'frequently', 'lead', 'awkward', 'confusing', 'moments', 'where', 'audience', 'not', 'know', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Bridget', 'laugh', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'similar', 'films', 'many', 'times', 'several', 'decades', 'predictability', 'story', 'Ultimately', 'sequel', 'way', 'short', 'accomplishments', 'made', 'initial', 'film.As', 'mentioned', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'short', 'compared', 'first', 'film', 'film', 'funny', 'moments', 'who', 'are', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'fans', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'performance', 'actually', 'remarkable', 'However', 'overall', 'film', 'only', 'mediocre', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'worth', 'renting', 'evening', 'when', 'audience', 'feels', 'need', 'put', 'things', 'perspective', 'regards', 'relationships', 'love']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

""Kimberly""","[13, 13]","After reading the reviews online I was a little hestitant about seeing the movie afterall, it's common sense that the sequel to any good movie never really turns out the way you want it too... but, in this case I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is what fans of Bridget have waited for-What happens after happily ever after we all wonder when we see the end to any movie and in this one we get the chance to see a piece of what becomes between the buff Bridget and her ""perfect"" boyfriend Mark-- who folds his underwear before he goes to sleep. In this reality strikes their relationship as Bridget and Mark deal with snobby/single friends, lesbian kisses, Thai prisons, break-ups, family, weekends spent away together, and work-- also a beautiful young secretary with long legs who happens to work with Mark. Of course, as in any squel there is a comeback by Daniel Cleaver who everywhere Bridget turns manages to see his face as he has just landed himself his own television show and is the same as ever-- and still going after Bridget. Can Bridget and Mark manage to survie??? Well I think we all know the answer to that.Colin Firth is more charming in this as Mark Darcy than he was in the first and of course, Renee does a wonderful job as the buff Brit who never seems to get anything right. Hugh Grant is davishly evil and once again you see that wonderful on-screen rivalry between Hugh and Firth.This was the film I have been waiting for after seeing the words ""the beginning"" in Bridget Jone's Diary... and I loved seeing Bridg and Mark together.

Instead, the viewer is set upon by a bloated script that lacks intelligence and charm. Even the main character, Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger), our formerly lovable every woman, seems to have lost some of her winning ways, as what previously seemed effortless, now seems too contrived. Quite frankly, this film simply does not reach the heights of excellence that the prequel did. So, those viewers who loved the original film will be disappointed.The direction of this film seems ham-handed, with a screenplay that simply tries too hard to be all that the original was.  Unfortunately, it fails in its execution, hampered with too many sub-plots that are simply not funny. Colin Firth (Marc Darcy) and Hugh Grant (Daniel Cleaver) reprise their original roles and manage to hang onto their charm, but their dialogue rings hollow, as they struggle with a script not worthy of them. Ms. Zellweger also struggles with her role, as at times it calls for her to act totally stupid, something that the original screenplay did not require. The screenwriters obviously confused stupidity with naivet&eacute;.  It is a shame that they were unable to come up with something worthier of the wonderful talent in this film. While there are some funny moments in the film, they are few and far between. In fact, some of the film is downright painful to watch.

629633,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005JNDZ,Lee Armstrong,"[5, 5]","Rene Zellweger was nominated for the Oscar for the first Bridget Jones' Diary film in 2001.  She was also nominated for a Golden Globe award for her performance in this sequel.  Beeban Kidron whose Hollywood directorial debut was for ""Used People"" in 1992 and also had a moderate hit with ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar,"" takes the slapstick and pratfalls to the next level in her work on this film.  The pacing on the film is brisk and keeps us riveted to the fine actors' performances.  Zellweger has gone from success to success with her Oscar nominated performance in ""Chicago"" and her Best Supporting Oscar win for ""Cold Mountain.""  She puts on a few pounds and makes Bridget seem like a real woman caught up in the strangeness of her life.  The sequence in Thailand where she lands in a jail and teaches all the Thai inmates to sing is hilarious.  What really works about the film is the romance.  As Mark Darcy, Colin Firth has a magnetism that he's been able to show repeatedly on film (""A Month in the Country,"" ""Valmont,"" ""Circle of Friends,"" ""The English Patient,"" ""Shakespeare In Love,"" ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"").  As the somewhat stiff barrister, he shows great heart while still maintaining that British reserve.  The fight sequence in the pond with Hugh Grant is hilarious.  The DVD extras where Grant & Firth repeatedly put each other down like, ""He's gaining some weight,"" or ""He's showing his age,"" is good-natured fun.  Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver is again one of Britain's best comic actors with great timing and charming good looks.  While Cleaver is as sleazy as ever, he's also hilariously sleazy, and the audience feels that the character just can't help himself.  All in all, while a bit more slapstick than the first film, this sequel puts a smile on your face and is a satisfying good time.

I mean, Bridget's going to Thailand with Daniel (!) and Rebecca's turning out to be lesbian IS NOT included in the original story, to say the least.There are no  witty scenes to speak of, only exaggerated ones that are embarrassing and painful rather than funny. There is no plot to speak of and no funny dialogues. The characters are all back, but you just can't find  the reason why, as they aren't given any chance to act. However, the worst of all is that the scriptwriters hand in hand with the director succeeded in transforming (=destroying) Bridget's down-to-earth, honest, witty character into a brainless, idiotic blonde ninny. Neither her character, nor her looks are credible any more. The terrible hair and make-up and the fact that instead of gaining some weight to appear more attractive Ren&eacute;e Z simply got fat! didn't help much. Not mentioning the disadvantageous and uncharacteristic clothes that the real Bridget - knowing exactly her good and bad points - would never have worn!You simply can't see why such a great guy as Mark Darcy and even such a lousy, but charming Daniel Cleaver would be attracted to her.The whole film is just a waste of time!",1,"Read the ""EoR"" book, but give this movie a miss!",1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,1705,"['enjoyed', 'first', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'book', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'sequel', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'painful', 'tedious', 'made', 'cringe', 'seat', 'times', 'was', 'watching', 'it.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'life', 'why', 'scriptwriters', 'did', ""n't"", 'thought', 'adequate', 'use', 'storyline', 'ideas', '2nd', 'BJ', 'book', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'very', 'good', 'sequel', 'especially', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'book', 'should', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Bridget', 'going', 'Thailand', 'Daniel', 'Rebecca', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'lesbian', 'IS', 'NOT', 'included', 'original', 'story', 'say', 'least.There', 'are', 'witty', 'scenes', 'speak', 'only', 'exaggerated', 'ones', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'painful', 'rather', 'funny', 'plot', 'speak', 'funny', 'dialogues', 'characters', 'are', 'back', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'reason', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'chance', 'act', 'However', 'worst', 'scriptwriters', 'hand', 'hand', 'director', 'succeeded', 'transforming', '=destroying', 'Bridget', 'down-to-earth', 'honest', 'witty', 'character', 'brainless', 'idiotic', 'blonde', 'ninny', 'character', 'looks', 'are', 'credible', 'more', 'terrible', 'hair', 'make-up', 'fact', 'instead', 'gaining', 'weight', 'appear', 'more', 'attractive', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Z', 'simply', 'got', 'fat', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'Not', 'mentioning', 'disadvantageous', 'uncharacteristic', 'clothes', 'real', 'Bridget', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'good', 'bad', 'points', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'worn', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'such', 'great', 'guy', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'even', 'lousy', 'charming', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'her.The', 'whole', 'film', 'just', 'waste', 'time']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

A lot of people feel the same way and so ""Austen Spinoffs"" are very popular.  However they seldom live up to the originals, expecially when it is a sequal to a spinoff, like THE EDGE OF REASON is a sequel to the spinoff, BRIDGET JONES DIARY.  Some Jane Austen spinoffs REALLY stink, and I have to say that in comparison, THE EDGE OF REASON isn't actually all that bad.  I was mildly entertained for an evening and I got a few laughs.  But it just doesn't do it for me like a ""True Jane"", and by the next day, I was having a hard time remembering exactly what this movie was about.I don't especially get the populaitry of Bridget Jones, since apart from the bare plot paralells and play on names (like Darcy) the actual sense of the story is far from PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  Bridget Jones is in no way similar to the intelligent, poised, witty, self possessed Elizabeth Bennett.  In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, it is easy to see why Darcy falls for our Lizzy, but I keep wondering what he sees in the grasping, silly, promiscuous, annoying and just plain embarassing Bridget!  Both characters are disadvantaged, but Elizabeth Bennett's shortcomings are completely external while Bridget Jones's issues are an ingregal part of her personal core. I suppose the point of the story is that if Bridget can find happiness with Darcy, then all of us everygirls have hope.  But for this kind of plot to interest me, it would have to have something that makes sense about his attraction to Bridget.  Elizabeth Bennett was beneath Darcy's social status, but she was a superior woman and you could see why he loved her - she was his equal in temperment, character and intellegence.  The fact that he was able to recognise her worth,and love her is the main thing that made him attractive as a love interest.  We all want to believe that there is something loveable in us, and a man who sees our finer qualities is dream boat!  But I definately didn't swoon over Bridget's Darcy.  She was beneath him in every possible way and I couldn't connect with them as a couple.  In fact, I found it hard to even respect a guy who could fall for someone like Bridget and the idea her as a heroine was a little depressing.  It just wasn't believable and therefore I didn't really care if they got back together or not.I also don't get Renee Zellwegger in the title role.  She is sometimes a decent actress, but I didn't find her believable as a Brit, because her accent and mannerisms seemed off.  Since I am an American, perhaps it was my ear that was off, but the whole thing came across so contrived and overdone that it was distracting.  Also, the weight Renee gained for this role looked unnatural on her, and I kept wishing that the lead character was someone who was truly British and naturally plump.  There are plenty of fat girls who are very beautiful because their faces and bodies are meant to be round and soft.  Rene's natural rock-hard fitness just didn't translate well, and instead of coming off as an ordinary overweight girl, she looked hard, ill, and bloated - It reminded me of the ""cockroach man"" in MEN IN BLACK.  Very distasteful.  What in the world would have been so bad about hiring a real, live, pretty, plus sized English actress to play this role?  Was it actually necessary to find a skinny actress and pay her to pack on a bunch of pounds?

Its a very charming and undemanding movie where Bridget tries to take her relationship with Mark Darcy to the next level. The sequel proves to be just as laid back as the first movie and I enjoyed the comic talents of all three stars involves, Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Yes, Grant as back in his usual role from the first movie, trying to ""change"" but remaining the same wormy self.There are some uneven spots along the way which may distract from the overall story. A good example of this would be the subplot of Bridget's friend and her involvment with a younger man which get Bridget thrown in Thai prison where she bonded with all these Thai women who really had bad relationships; making Bridget realized how lucky she was with Mark. The entire scene, charming as it is, was bit off tangent from the general tone of the movie.Zellweger managed to master her English accent pretty well this time around and her perky demeanor and high spirit carried the movie pretty well. Her skills as an actress also improved as well. Both Firth and Grant provided very good support as well. Firth had more screen time then Grant this time around and Bridget's ""friends and family"" also got less screen time as movie worked around the relationship between Bridget and Mark.

She was the Spider-Man of Superheroes; the everyday average woman with every day average troubles who was a victim of circumstance, and eventually bad luck turned into good luck and she ended up with the handsome successful lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth).This time around she is too stupid for us to care about her.  She is her own worst enemy, and no one really cares about that heroine.  She is pathetic.  She sabotages her relationship - more importantly, herself - not through her insecurities about her weight, paranoia or jealousy, but just by being an overall basket case.  Gone is the woman from the first flix who was a least trying; this one seems to be trying to but herself into ridiculous situations when she is not flat out screwing up something if her life.Bottom line, the first movie was enough and it is best to remember the character that way.

Also, Bridget just didn't seem to be quite as ""endearing"" as she was in the first.There were humorous scenes and the ending was happy, but it just seemed like they tried to cram a bunch of stuff in the movie thinking it's what people wanted.

Adding extra stuff or changing events is sometimes a great thing (like in John Grisham's ""The Firm"") but it didn't seem to work here.The movie's okay and is a nice light chick type of flick...and my opinion would be the same even without reading the book.

She stopped being a dreaded singleton. She became a TV journalist. She finally accepted herself as she was - the 20 extra pounds, the cigarettes, the alcohol units and all. She grew up.But wait a minute. Did she? In ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,"" the old Bridget is back, confused and silly as ever, and wearing yet more stupid hats and questionable sweaters.And with her, the old movie is back. Nearly intact. The producers might be selling ""The Edge of Reason"" as a sequel, but it is so close to the original, in details large and small, that it could be considered the industry's fastest remake to date - three years and change.The movie takes place a mere six weeks after the end of the first. Bridget (Renee Zellweger) is swooningly in love with Mark (Colin Firth), who adores her in return. For some reason, though, she is still insecure. She suspects he might be cheating on her, which leads to a few pratfalls as she spies on him.Then - hurrah! as Bridget might say -Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) turns up and turns Bridget's head once again with his sly, seductive humor. They wind up in Thailand together, which could be considered new, but is actually just a change of scenery, since Bridget, of course, gets herself into embarrassing trouble there as easily as in London.For those who enjoy more of the same, it's a likable enough, light entertainment. Zellweger is still adorable, and Grant is still the funniest thing in the movie. But the second time around, the flaws that we easily overlooked in the first movie are more visible and are suddenly incredibly annoying.Chief among them is Bridget herself, and what makes her annoying lies in the difference between the Bridget of the books and the Bridget of the movies. In the books, Bridget goes through all manner of humiliations, but the key is that she is writing about them, and so they come to us filtered through her quite wicked, even sophisticated wit. In the movies, Bridget does not get to ""tell"" her story; she is the object of the stories, and so all we see are the stupid humiliations without the mitigating wit.In short, she looks not like a wit, but like a nitwit. And so, as Bridget stumbles from stupid gaffe to humiliating mistake to embarrassing outburst, just as you're supposed to think, ""Oh, how cute,"" instead you're thinking, ""Does she have the IQ of an inflatable doll?""""I don't get it,"" I e-mailed a female friend of mine the morning after the preview screening. ""Is this a movie only a woman could love?""""Actually, it's a movie to make a thinking woman question her love of the first movie. Was Bridget really so retrograde a figure the first time?"" was her response.Perhaps. When Daniel is trying to flatter her into bed, he reminisces about the events of the first movie. ""You made me laugh, Jones,"" he says smoothly, ""though I was always laughing AT you, not with you.""Which pretty well sums it up, I'd say.",3,so called sequel really a remake without a reason,1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,3055,"['end', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'sweet', 'sexy', 'clumsy', 'confused', 'Bridget', 'had', 'last', 'fulfilled', 'dreams.She', 'found', 'ideal', 'man', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'stopped', 'being', 'dreaded', 'singleton', 'became', 'TV', 'journalist', 'finally', 'accepted', 'was', '20', 'extra', 'pounds', 'cigarettes', 'alcohol', 'units', 'grew', 'up.But', 'wait', 'minute', 'Did', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'old', 'Bridget', 'back', 'confused', 'silly', 'ever', 'wearing', 'yet', 'more', 'stupid', 'hats', 'questionable', 'sweaters.And', 'old', 'movie', 'back', 'Nearly', 'intact', 'producers', 'might', 'be', 'selling', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'sequel', 'so', 'close', 'original', 'details', 'large', 'small', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'industry', 'fastest', 'remake', 'date', 'three', 'years', 'change.The', 'movie', 'place', 'mere', 'six', 'weeks', 'end', 'first', 'Bridget', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'swooningly', 'love', 'Mark', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'return', 'reason', 'still', 'insecure', 'might', 'be', 'cheating', 'few', 'pratfalls', 'him.Then', 'hurrah', 'Bridget', 'might', 'say', '-Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'up', 'Bridget', 'head', 'once', 'again', 'sly', 'seductive', 'humor', 'wind', 'up', 'Thailand', 'together', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'new', 'actually', 'just', 'change', 'scenery', 'Bridget', 'course', 'embarrassing', 'trouble', 'there', 'as', 'easily', 'London.For', 'who', 'enjoy', 'more', 'same', 'likable', 'enough', 'light', 'entertainment', 'Zellweger', 'still', 'adorable', 'Grant', 'still', 'funniest', 'thing', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'flaws', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'first', 'movie', 'are', 'more', 'visible', 'are', 'suddenly', 'incredibly', 'annoying.Chief', 'Bridget', 'what', 'annoying', 'lies', 'difference', 'Bridget', 'books', 'Bridget', 'movies', 'books', 'Bridget', 'manner', 'humiliations', 'key', 'writing', 'so', 'come', 'filtered', 'quite', 'wicked', 'even', 'sophisticated', 'wit', 'movies', 'Bridget', 'not', 'get', 'tell', 'story', 'object', 'stories', 'so', 'see', 'are', 'stupid', 'humiliations', 'mitigating', 'wit.In', 'short', 'not', 'wit', 'nitwit', 'so', 'Bridget', 'stupid', 'gaffe', 'humiliating', 'mistake', 'embarrassing', 'outburst', 'just', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'think', 'Oh', 'how', 'cute', 'instead', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'have', 'IQ', 'inflatable', 'doll', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'e-mailed', 'female', 'friend', 'mine', 'morning', 'preview', 'screening', 'movie', 'only', 'woman', 'could', 'love', 'Actually', 'movie', 'make', 'thinking', 'woman', 'question', 'love', 'first', 'movie', 'Was', 'Bridget', 'really', 'so', 'retrograde', 'figure', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'response.Perhaps', 'When', 'Daniel', 'trying', 'flatter', 'bed', 'events', 'first', 'movie', 'made', 'Jones', 'smoothly', 'was', 'always', 'laughing', 'AT', 'not', 'Which', 'pretty', 'well', 'sums', 'up', ""'d"", 'say']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

Get it for your birthday, Christmas, or hint that you want it, but can't find it cheap enough, and some nice person will buy it for you.I wasn't expecting much from this movie, although I ended up watching it straight away, just to see what it was like. I already knew it wasn't going to be a patch on the original, and it was going to be totally different from the book. What I noticed was how different Bridget was from the movie. She was slightly attractive in the first movie, but in this, Renee had awful stylists etc. Her hair was a mess a lot of the time, and she had hamster cheeks. And what was equally distracting was the fact she was poured into really low cut tops a lot of the time. We all know that when Renee's not being Bridget she's ultra skinny, but in this she just wanted to flaunt her chest as much as possible! At least 50% of the world's population, if not more, have them dear, there's no need to shove them in our faces! And as for the lesbian kiss - what was the point in that, apart from the fact it was a cheap thrill for the guys? There was absolutely no need for it.So the film is very different from the book. Bearing in mind, I haven't read the book in a few years, so don't quote me on this. The Thai jail scene is a lot longer, and more tougher in the book. There's no Like A Virgin singalongs in that! And Bridget lost a lot of weight during her time in there (in the book), but she looked just the same when she came out. The first book was not-so-loosely based on Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". The first movie left a lot of that in, and even included a lot of ""inside jokes"" for those of us who are familiar with the book and the filmed version starring Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy. ""The Edge of Reason"" was not-so-loosely based on another Jane Austen novel, ""Persuasion,"" but any overt Austen references are completely wiped out here. Also, in the second book, Bridget had to interview the God in her life, Colin Firth. That would have been slightly difficult since Colin Firth is already in the movie playing of course Mark Darcy. I'm pretty sure this scene might be among the extras, but not included in the movie. Of course, they could have always done an Oceans 12, and had Colin Firth playing Mark Darcy playing Colin Firth. The mind boggles.Some of the movie is funny - the skiing scenes gave me flashbacks of my own skiing incidents (including dragging the instructor down the slope with me cos I was so scared), and yet again, the hair-pulling, and eye gouging between Colin Firth & Hugh Grant. But apart from that, there's nothing else that funny about the movie. It's watchable. It just doesn't have the same class as the original. At least with the second book, Helen Fielding attempted to move away from her original work, and have some fun with Bridget. This movie sticks closely to the first, with no surprises thrown in.Bridget's friends have a lesser part in this than the first, and they were hilarious in the first! There is also another 'friend' added who's never really introduced, but just hovering in the background.A lot of this movie is meant to be spent watching with a group of girlie friends, in your PJs, drinking wine, and having pillow fights. Why? Mainly because every other scene is backed by an overly loud soundtrack, featuring a lot of the songs that funnily enough on the soundtrack to the movie!!! Funnily enough, there is also a lot of drunken ballads to be sung at the top of your voice, like the ""All By Myself"" at the start of the first movie. Talk about over publicising the soundtrack to the movie! Also, there's a lot of product placement in this movie: Coca Cola, Vodaphone, BMI and probably more that I missed.

For the life of me, I cannot figure out what is supposed to be appealing about Renee Zellweger's character.  She's not a BAD person, but she's annoying and is a social disaster, and I don't understand how these two fabulous British guys (played by Colin Firth and Hugh Grant) could possibly be interested in her.The plot of ""The Edge of Reason"" also leaves a lot to be desired.  There really wasn't anything else to tell about Bridget Jones, but since the first film made so much money, they decided to make a second movie (regardless of the fact that it was so crappy) in hopes of making even MORE money.  Sadly, the plan worked, but I wasted two hours of my life in the movie theatre that I'll never get back.I really tried to like this movie.  I love Firth and Grant, but they weren't enough to save the film.  (Grant is only in the movie for a grand total of about ten minutes, too, so moviegoers who haven't read the book version will likely be disappointed.)  By the time the Thai prison scenes rolled around, I was thoroughly disgusted.  How could they have made this movie more ridiculous?!  I don't think they could have.The only ""good"" thing I can say about this movie is that it supposedly sticks pretty close to the plot of the book, but that should tell you something about the quality of that particular novel.

629656,A1ZJDHOYFZYVVJ,B00005JNDZ,Nacie,"[10, 13]","First of all, this movie has been unfairly (I feel) panned by almost every reviewer out there. However, if you check closely you'll note that practically ALL of them are male.And, frankly, they just don't get it.Bridget Jones is a woman's heroine. Yes, she falls, trips, says the wrong thing at the wrong time, and worries constantly about her weight,...but who doesn't?This film picks up where Bridget Jones's Diary left off; Bridget (Renee Zellwieger)is happily in a relationship with the lovely Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), and trying to figure out how to keep it going strong despite the obvious differences in their careers, backgrounds and general dispositions.Yes, she's insecure and quick to jump to conclusions, but on the whole, I thought the writers handled her (and his) reactions very well.In the middle of all this angst comes Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), who hasn't changed a bit despite his promise to having been reformed. As luck would have it he's now working at the same TV station as Bridget, and as double luck would have it Mark Darcy has a new, beautiful assistant.So here we have the basic premise which, of course equals many potential problems.Some of the slapstick does get a bit out there, such as her jumping from an airplane right into a pig pen (what's the chances of that happening I wonder?), or when she slides off of Mark's roof and suffers nothing worse than some plantlife stuck in her hair. But, all in all, these are two of the most irresistable characters in movies today, and I personally find all of this worry and insecurity rather...well, sexy.By the way, as much as some other reviewers have obsessed on Bridget's weight, and been most insulting to the rest of us while doing it (you mean a woman who's not a perfect size 5 can't be loved?), I thought she looked very good. Even at 130 lbs., she displays a curvaciousness that up until the last thirty years would have been considered the norm and not just ""fat"".The other point I'd like to make is that contrary to those reviewers who said that Daniel was not even in the 2nd book, check again. Although his part is small, he not only IS included, he gets punched in the mouth by our dear Darcy (well done, Mark!).All in all, I found this movie delightful, and am anticipating the DVD with high hopes.",4,Bridget is back and I love it!,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,2295,"['First', 'all', 'movie', 'been', 'unfairly', 'feel', 'panned', 'almost', 'reviewer', 'there', 'However', 'check', 'closely', ""'ll"", 'note', 'practically', 'are', 'male.And', 'frankly', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.Bridget', 'Jones', 'woman', 'heroine', 'Yes', 'trips', 'wrong', 'thing', 'wrong', 'time', 'worries', 'constantly', 'weight', 'who', ""n't"", 'film', 'up', 'where', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'left', 'off', 'Bridget', 'Renee', 'Zellwieger', 'happily', 'relationship', 'lovely', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'keep', 'going', 'strong', 'obvious', 'differences', 'careers', 'backgrounds', 'general', 'dispositions.Yes', 'insecure', 'quick', 'jump', 'conclusions', 'whole', 'thought', 'writers', 'handled', 'reactions', 'very', 'well.In', 'middle', 'angst', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'who', ""n't"", 'changed', 'bit', 'promise', 'having', 'been', 'reformed', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'now', 'working', 'same', 'TV', 'station', 'Bridget', 'double', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'new', 'beautiful', 'assistant.So', 'here', 'have', 'basic', 'premise', 'course', 'equals', 'many', 'potential', 'problems.Some', 'slapstick', 'get', 'bit', 'there', 'such', 'jumping', 'airplane', 'right', 'pig', 'pen', 'what', 'chances', 'happening', 'wonder', 'when', 'slides', 'Mark', 'roof', 'suffers', 'nothing', 'worse', 'plantlife', 'stuck', 'hair', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'irresistable', 'characters', 'movies', 'today', 'personally', 'find', 'worry', 'insecurity', 'rather', 'well', 'sexy.By', 'way', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'obsessed', 'Bridget', 'weight', 'been', 'most', 'insulting', 'rest', 'doing', 'mean', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'perfect', 'size', '5', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'loved', 'thought', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'Even', '130', 'lbs.', 'curvaciousness', 'up', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'norm', 'not', 'just', 'fat', 'other', 'point', ""'d"", 'like', 'make', 'contrary', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'Daniel', 'was', 'not', 'even', '2nd', 'book', 'check', 'again', 'part', 'small', 'not', 'only', 'IS', 'included', 'punched', 'mouth', 'dear', 'Darcy', 'well', 'done', 'Mark', '.All', 'found', 'movie', 'delightful', 'am', 'anticipating', 'DVD', 'high', 'hopes']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason stars Renee Zellweger in her reprisal of the chunky, outspoken, good-hearted Jones. For several reasons, I thought this movie was a hit and miss endeavor.

(Which incidentally, was only four weeks before the second movie begins.

When will I learn that all sequels are generally crap? I get my self all exited only to be let down.  There's nothing new in this movie. No character growth, no original ideas, and no humour. Okay maybe a little humour if you can call it that. Being British myself, I can only describe this as Americas view on British people in general. We're not all dithering idiots that use the word shag in every other sentence.  Bridget has transcended into a paranoid, annoying and embarrassing individual and not in the cute way so much as you want to slap her for being so ignorant. The witty dialogue in the first film has been replaced with rather pathetic physical comedy that induces nausea. Its so unrealistic. And the whole Thai jail thing? Well that plot was lifted from a film called Broke down palace, with Clair Danes. That was crap as well. You'd think they'd take a hint. Colin Firth plays Fitzwilliam Darcy in the 21st century yet again. Personally I'm tired of seeing him play the same character in every film. Kind of like Sandra Bullock (you know its true). I didn't mind Hugh Grant, but that was probably because he had the most amusing lines. I just hope he expands to more then his two I'm a total sex rogue\clueless dopey English guy from Notting Hill roles. As for comparisons from the first movie1. Jones lands bottom first on camera. Check2. Cleaver remarks on how urr..appropriate her mini skirt is. Check3. Darcy's in a stupid Jumper. Check4. Darcy and Cleaver have another fight, only this time its totally unfunny because we've seen it all before. Check. Playing horrific music from The Darkness doesn't help5. The big knickers have there come back. Check6. Jones makes total fool of herself in front of a crowd of haughty tautys. Check except this time its not endearing because she's become a total twitThere's more but I need to wrap things up. Basically Jones has gone from a rather amusing character into a paranoid, stupid git that doesn't think before she starts spouting total tosh and revealing herself to be no good for anyone really. Being a woman myself, I think she gives us a bad name. Perhaps men like blond, ditsy, insecure, jealous woman because it makes them feel intelligent and in control. I don't know. I have one more gripe: the making fun and stereotyping of the Thai woman in jail was totally wrong. And Bridget giving the `men are from Mars, woman are from Venus' books was stupid. Plus if the title was in English I'm assuming the books were as well so how the hell are they supposed to read it anyway. Perhaps I'm just too picky. If you're looking for some good English humour, try Fry & Laurie, French & Saunders, Absolutely Fabulous and The Vicar of Dibly. I enjoyed the lesbian scene though. It was the only plot point that I didn't see coming from a mile off.

Sad, then, that this movie adaptation of that novel lacks almost all of the warmth and wit of the book, replacing it instead with schmaltz and tired stereotyping, histrionic set-pieces and truly predictable comedy.Bridget is now in a relationship with Mark Darcey and the Daniel Cleaver affair seems to be well and truly behind her. Her career is going well and her friends are jealous. So far, so good. Suddenly, she and Mark break up, she and Daniel are sent to Thailand together, she's framed for cocaine smuggling, and unless her friend Shazzer can alert Mark in time, it'll all end in tears.Except after the first thirty minutes or so, the sugary sweetness and blind mundanity of the movie we just don't care how it ends.Zellwegger's accent and performance mannerisms are once more flawless in their British impersonation, and she does what she can with a truly uninspiring script. Firth as Mark Darcey is the same as before, except now almost totally one-dimensional, lacking any of the depth of either the novel or the original movie. Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver is now a totally transparent character, and the movie-invented TV show he hosts does not serve any purpose other than to showcase his soullessness - a trait which we were already well aware of, why underline it here? - and at the movie's end we do find ourselves wondering what the point of including him in the screenplay was.Not that these are bad actors, you understand - this is the fault of a lousy script that relies far too heavily on schmaltzy emotion and a gross underestimation of the audiences' intelligence levels. Devoid of all subtlety and warmth, the movie  rattles on to a cheesy and predictable close, but by that stage, you may well have switched off before the inexorable happy ending.One to avoid, read the novel instead.",2,Charmless and Tawdry imitation of the Prequel,1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,2431,"['original', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'committed', 'so', 'many', 'Book-To-Film', 'conversion', 'crimes', 'impossible', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'changed', 'events', 'omitted', 'things', 'cast', 'American', 'role', 'British', 'Poster', 'Girl', 'Singletons', 'etc', 'was', 'excellent', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'full', 'same', 'kind', 'bittersweet', 'humour', 'zany', 'slapstick', 'made', 'novel', 'seminal', 'classic.The', 'book', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'perhaps', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'original', 'still', 'excellent', 'read', 'Helen', 'Fielding', 'wry', 'observationism', 'witty', 'sarcasm', 'are', 'as', 'vibrant', 'ever', 'Sad', 'then', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'almost', 'warmth', 'wit', 'book', 'replacing', 'instead', 'schmaltz', 'tired', 'stereotyping', 'histrionic', 'set-pieces', 'truly', 'predictable', 'comedy.Bridget', 'now', 'relationship', 'Mark', 'Darcey', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'affair', 'be', 'well', 'truly', 'career', 'going', 'well', 'friends', 'are', 'jealous', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'Suddenly', 'Mark', 'break', 'up', 'Daniel', 'are', 'sent', 'Thailand', 'together', 'framed', 'cocaine', 'smuggling', 'friend', 'Shazzer', 'can', 'alert', 'Mark', 'time', ""'ll"", 'end', 'tears.Except', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'so', 'sugary', 'sweetness', 'blind', 'mundanity', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'ends.Zellwegger', 'accent', 'performance', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'once', 'more', 'flawless', 'British', 'impersonation', 'what', 'can', 'truly', 'uninspiring', 'script', 'Firth', 'Mark', 'Darcey', 'same', 'now', 'almost', 'totally', 'one-dimensional', 'lacking', 'depth', 'novel', 'original', 'movie', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'now', 'totally', 'transparent', 'character', 'movie-invented', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'serve', 'purpose', 'other', 'showcase', 'soullessness', 'trait', 'were', 'already', 'well', 'aware', 'why', 'underline', 'here', 'movie', 'end', 'do', 'find', 'wondering', 'what', 'point', 'including', 'screenplay', 'was.Not', 'are', 'bad', 'actors', 'understand', 'fault', 'lousy', 'script', 'far', 'too', 'heavily', 'schmaltzy', 'emotion', 'gross', 'underestimation', 'audiences', 'intelligence', 'levels', 'Devoid', 'subtlety', 'warmth', 'movie', 'cheesy', 'predictable', 'close', 'stage', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'switched', 'off', 'inexorable', 'happy', 'ending.One', 'avoid', 'read', 'novel', 'instead']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

Ploddingly written, with little wit and a barrage of expletives, this is a complete waste of your time.  It is revolting in its stereotyping of the Thai people - how misguided is it to have Bridget, the ultimate fantasy figure, compare her problems to the real ones of a Thai woman, in jail, a prostitute, beaten and forced to take heroin by her pimp?  Is the child sex trade in Thailand good material for a 'joke', as occurs when Bridget is on a plane seated next to a beer-swiling boor?  Wake up audience!  This is not harmless light entertainment, it is drearily cynical garbage.*Aside from the racial slurs, there is the predictable sexual stereotyping.  Bridget's suitors are rich, intelligent, and, especially in Darcy's case, powerful.  Bridget is less than rich, less than intelligent, and a victim to the point of feeling 'unworthy' - much of the alleged humour is prised from her acute embarassment.  The men use their powers to gain Bridget's affection, which is largely equated with sexual favours, and dreams of marriage and babies.  Her career is belittled, any success seen as accidental, theirs presented as important, glamorous, and well deserved.  Of course it's possible to milk some laughs from all this, but haven't we seen all this many times before?  Isn't it tedious?*Grant has his character down pat, and he provides the few genuine laughs.  Renee is made to look as unattractive as possible - one wonders whether the men behind the film have deliberately done this, again quite cynically - all very well to say it's 'brave' of the actress, but why are the men presented normally.  Colin Firth - why is he bothering with this?  The minor characters, especially Bridget's so-called friends, are repulsive and unbelievable - her parents are similarly embodiments of a single joke repeated ad nauseam.*In terms of basic plotting, it is also very weak.  For the first half of the film it's only Darcy and Bridget.  He is all wonderful, she is all paranoia.  It takes Cleaver, Hugh Grant, to add any drama, hackneyed those this may be.

629667,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JNDZ,Robert Moore,"[2, 3]","The essential problem with the second Bridget Jones film is that the best parts remind the viewer of parts of the first film that were done a whole lot better.  It is a pleasant enough movie, but not so pleasant that I would recommend it over taking a risk on any other film or doing something safe like rewatching an episode of BUFFY.  I haven't read the book upon which the second film is based, so perhaps it is to blame for the relative blandness of the sequel, but something is to blame for the fact that while the original was charming and entertaining, the sequel feels tired and derivative.  But even if the book is to blame, it is incumbent upon anyone making a sequel to try to find some way of making the second film in some way new, instead of merely recycling the first.  In this regard, the movie fails.An additional problem I had with this movie is that it took some of the weaker aspects of the original even further than it had done.  For instance, one of the sources of the original was Bridget's penchant for making a bit of an ass out of herself.  Despite this, she constantly manages to come across as cute and adorable, but in the second film she merely looks ridiculous.  The first film presented Bridget as a sympathetic character, but she was much harder to love in the second.  Again, the fault may lie with the source material, but it is important for any filmmakers, when confronted with a weak source, to make it stronger in the rewrite.As with the original, Renee Zellweger is delightful as Bridget, and she remains the main reason for watching the film.  She is one of my favorite contemporary actresses, and someone who hasn't done the range of performances that I would have liked to see her take on.  I miss the days when she did small, independent films like THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.  She looks a bit plumper in this one than in the original, and it is interesting that one of the more celebrated non-anorexic characters of reason years would be played twice by one of the thinnest actresses in the movies.  On the other hand, I didn't like either Colin Firth or Hugh Grant as much in this film as in the former.  The interesting thing about Mark Darcy (just as with his namesake from the BBC production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE-not a slip on my part, because Ms Fielding acknowledges that the model for Darcy was Colin Firth's performance in the six-hour BBC production of the Jane Austen classic) in the first film was in gradually learning about his true feelings about Bridget.  There was no such mystery in this one.  Likewise, knowing from the original that Daniel Cleaver was a deceptive, manipulative creep made him a pretty uninteresting character in the sequel.  The guys too as good a job as is possible given the limited possibilities of character development, but their roles are too circumvented to allow of much interest.So, do I recommend this or not?  I really am on the fence.  I guess I'm glad I saw it, but if I hadn't I would have been able to preserve more fully my respect for the original.

Bridget Jones would be a friend like that.She's hopelessly lovable, and she's always going to be your friend no matter what, but, really, who but Bridget, with her guilt-ridden diary entries for alcohol and nicotine units per day, would manage to get jailed in Thailand on drug-smuggling charges?Bridget of course is not a drug smuggler, but being Bridget she did the one thing no tourist should ever do, and that is to carry in her luggage a souvenir given to her girl friend by a guy. But Bridget has pluck. In no time at all, she's traded her pink bra for cigarettes, organized her prison inmates into a Madonna class, and they're rehearsing ""Like a Virgin.""""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" is a jolly movie and I smiled pretty much all the way through, but it doesn't shift into high with a solid thunk the way ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" (2001) did. In the first movie, things happened to Bridget. In the sequel, Bridget happens to things.As the story opens, Bridget is happily involved with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), who to her astonishment became her boyfriend in the earlier film. Plump Bridget, in love with a hunk! She's still working as an on-air personality for a TV show which seems to be running its private version of ""Fear Factor"" just for Bridget; surely this girl is not ready to sky dive? Or ski? Or manage a romance without getting unreasonably jealous of the quality time Mark seems to be spending with his colleague Rebecca (Jacinda Barrett)? But she loves the guy. Who else could keep him standing outside her door while she finishes leaving a message for him on his answering machine? Especially when the message is, essentially, that he is standing outside even as she speaks?Bridget depends as before on the wisdom of three friends whose advice is infallibly dangerous. They are Shazzer (Sally Phillips), Tom (James Callis) and Jude (Shirley Henderson), and they support her when she and Mark have a completely unreasonable fight. Bridget flies off to Thailand on assignment and discovers that her former boyfriend Daniel (Hugh Grant) is already there. This is a man she should never, ever, have anything to do with, but because she is mad at Mark she allows herself to be maneuvered into a position where Daniel can cry with glee: ""Please! Please be wearing the giant panties!""Renee Zellweger is lovable to begin with, and combining her with Bridget Jones creates a critical mass of cuteness: You don't want to just watch her, you want to tickle her ears and scratch under her chin. She has that desperately hopeful smile, and the endearing optimism of a woman in a dress two sizes too small. When she embarrasses herself, it's big-time, as when she single-handedly causes Mark's table to lose the annual quiz at the Law Society Dinner.The scenes in Thailand, it must be said, venture beyond contrivance. Bridget is the kind of woman who is more at home dealing with the sorts of things that could happen to anybody, like dropping a rock Cornish game hen down the front of her dress. She isn't made for cocaine busts. And it's a little mystifying why Daniel and Mark, two relatively important and successful men no longer in their first youth, have another brawl over her. Their motivation, I think, is that the fight in the first movie was so funny. Hugh Grant is so good at losing his dignity that we forget what skillful acting it requires to assure us he has any. Colin Firth plays the basically good guy, never a plum role; rascals always have more fun in comedies.Standing back from ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,"" I can see that the perfection of the first film has been replaced here by a series of comic episodes that could as easily be about anything else. The movie doesn't have the dire necessity of Bridget 1's quest for true love. If we didn't know better, we'd suspect that Bridget 2 subtly engineers her way into pickles because she knows how cute she looks when she gets in trouble.Still, at the end of the day, I left hoping there will be a Bridget 3.

Zwick,"[6, 7]","At the end of ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" the aforementioned Ms. Jones believed she had found eternal happiness in the arms of her new boyfriend, civil rights attorney Mark Darcy.  But at the beginning of ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason`"" she seems not to have achieved the happy-ever-after ending that both she and we thought she had.  After only a short while together, Bridget suspects that Mark may be cheating on her, and Mark seems embarrassed by all the social faux pas Bridget commits while in public.Even before the opening credits had ended, I had a premonition that this film might be a stinker when I noticed that no fewer than four people were credited with having had a hand in the screenplay - a sure sign of trouble if ever there was one.  And I wasn't wrong, for ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" stinks to the high heavens.And what did these four talented, highly paid writers come up with for all their efforts?  A patchwork mess consisting of preposterous situations, boneheaded dialogue, and thoroughly unappealing characters, that`s what.  Frumpy, shrill, desperate and wracked with insecurities, Bridget comes across as the kind of needy, high maintenance girlfriend that would send any reasonably self-respecting man racing not for the altar but for the exits.  It's amazing Mark puts up with her for as long as he does, yet, in all honesty, he`s really no more appealing than she is.  All they do is fight then make up, bicker then reconcile for nigh unto two hours with no rhyme or reason to any of it.  Every moment in the film feels pre-fabricated and arbitrary, with no connection at all to the real world or recognizable human emotions.  In short, as romantic partners, the two of them are so insufferable that I kept wishing that they would put their relationship out of its misery before some desperate soul in the audience did it for them.Renee Zelwegger and Colin Firth are annoying and grating as the ill-fated pair, and Hugh Grant sleazes his way through the part of the slime-ball news reporter, Daniel Cleaver.  All three actors deserve much better than being mired in a hopeless misfire like this one.  Instead of giving us believable characters in believable situations, the filmmakers pile on scene after scene of inane, embarrassing slapstick routines:  Bridget jumping out of an airplane, Bridget racing uncontrollably down a ski slope, Bridget getting drenched by passing motorist, Bridget getting arrested for cocaine possession in Thailand etc.  Then, in order to cover up for the emptiness of the screenplay, the filmmakers ladle on an endless series of golden oldies to fill up the soundtrack.""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" is about as bad as a romantic comedy can get.

Now, it's paycheck time, and little more, and no wonder Zellweger shed her chunky monkey physique so quickly post-production: She plays one miserable character. This is not the Jones you'd want to know.Director Beeban Kidron has designed ""Edge of Reason"" to make Bridget not a heroine but a lightning rod of unappealing, embarrassing sequences - in a pig slop, at Marc's lawyer ball, on the ski slopes, in, yes, a Thai prison (where the girls shrug off their communal, disease-ridden existence for an impromptu rendition of Madonna's ""Like A Virgin."")What was it again that was so special about Ms. Jones? Is staring at someone as they sleep really that endearing a trait? How about suffering three increasingly annoying, meddling friends?

629674,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B00005JNDZ,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[3, 5]","Colin Firth still tops the list as one of the hottest leading men, and he only improves with age.  Hugh Grant is comparably handsome, but we find that his character Daniel is up to his old tricks (so despite the fact that he looks absolutely gorgeous, we know he's NOT the one for Bridget). (I must be getting older, as men in their 40s are beginning to look more and more attractive...)In my opinion, this sequel was well done. The plot may have been a little thin, but I thought the dialogue hilarious.  I was in stitches for much of the movie. In fact, I thought the sequel even funnier than (or at least as funny as) the original, though I admit the plot wasn't as good. (Likewise, I thought Analyze That funnier than Analyze This and loved Meet the Fockers as much as Meet the Parents--as an aside, when my brother got married a little over a year ago, both wedding parties claimed to be the Fockers...)A few things that I really liked about this movie: it's SO sweet, and I can't imagine a better catch for any woman than Mark Darcy.  When he claims that he was just ""a messanger"" for his law firm who happened to be in Thailand (where Bridget is wrongfully arrested for cocaine smuggling), Bridget looses heart.  She later learns that Mark travelled throughout the world, tracking down the real criminal with as much aplomb as James Bond or the Avengers. I like that despite Bridget's numerous social gaffes and self-professed ""love handles,"" Mark really loves her and recognizes her worth. In other words, unconditional love conquers misunderstandings, jealousies, physical imperfections, and words said in the heat of anger. Bridget Jones is a realistic woman the rest of us can relate to: she battles with insecurities, tries (unsuccessfully) to get rid of bad habits (in Bridget's case, smoking and unhealthy eating), and makes many of the mistakes featured in the movie, ""How to Loose a Guy in 10 Days.""  Yet she's charming and a refreshing break from the Superwoman syndrome.If you want an escapist movie with some good laughs, this is a great movie to watch.One part that wasn't so funny--we see women who share their horror stories with Bridget while she's in prison in Thailand--so there's room for social advocacy on the behalf of the viewer and human rights activists.",4,If only there were more Mark Darcys...,1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,2286,"['Colin', 'Firth', 'still', 'list', 'one', 'hottest', 'leading', 'men', 'only', 'age', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'comparably', 'handsome', 'find', 'character', 'Daniel', 'up', 'old', 'tricks', 'so', 'fact', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'know', 'one', 'Bridget', 'must', 'be', 'getting', 'older', 'men', '40s', 'are', 'beginning', 'look', 'more', 'more', 'attractive', 'opinion', 'sequel', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'plot', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'thin', 'thought', 'dialogue', 'hilarious', 'was', 'stitches', 'much', 'movie', 'fact', 'thought', 'sequel', 'even', 'funnier', 'least', 'as', 'funny', 'original', 'admit', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Likewise', 'thought', 'Analyze', 'funnier', 'Analyze', 'loved', 'Meet', 'Fockers', 'as', 'much', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'aside', 'when', 'brother', 'got', 'married', 'little', 'over', 'year', 'ago', 'wedding', 'parties', 'claimed', 'be', 'Fockers', 'few', 'things', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'SO', 'sweet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'better', 'catch', 'woman', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'When', 'was', 'just', 'messanger', 'law', 'firm', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'Thailand', 'where', 'Bridget', 'wrongfully', 'arrested', 'cocaine', 'smuggling', 'Bridget', 'heart', 'later', 'Mark', 'travelled', 'world', 'tracking', 'down', 'real', 'criminal', 'as', 'much', 'aplomb', 'James', 'Bond', 'Avengers', 'like', 'Bridget', 'numerous', 'social', 'gaffes', 'self-professed', 'love', 'handles', 'Mark', 'really', 'recognizes', 'worth', 'other', 'words', 'unconditional', 'love', 'conquers', 'misunderstandings', 'jealousies', 'physical', 'imperfections', 'words', 'said', 'heat', 'anger', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'realistic', 'woman', 'rest', 'can', 'relate', 'insecurities', 'tries', 'unsuccessfully', 'get', 'rid', 'bad', 'habits', 'Bridget', 'case', 'smoking', 'unhealthy', 'eating', 'many', 'mistakes', 'featured', 'movie', 'How', 'Loose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'charming', 'refreshing', 'break', 'Superwoman', 'syndrome.If', 'want', 'escapist', 'movie', 'good', 'laughs', 'great', 'movie', 'watch.One', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'funny', 'see', 'women', 'who', 'share', 'horror', 'stories', 'Bridget', 'prison', 'Thailand', 'room', 'social', 'advocacy', 'behalf', 'viewer', 'human', 'rights', 'activists']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

629677,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JNDZ,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 3]","The original ""Bridget Jones Diary"" is one of my favorite recent comedies . . . I can say that even though I'm a guy.  Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant led a stellar ensemble cast that was as committed to pitch-perfect little moments as it was to broad laughs and big romantic scenes.  All in all, the original ""BJD"" is right up there with the most charming of English comedies.But you know what happens with Hollywood and good ideas - if there's a nickel to be made, then nothing is sacred.Somehow Zellweger, Firth and Grant let their ""people"" talk them into making this absolutely soulless shell of a sequel.  On the Sequel Scale, with ""Godfather II"" at the top with an easy 10 and ""Caddyshack 2"" a zero, ""Bridget Jones:  The Edge of Reason"" rates about a 1.5.  The concept is stupid - Bridget is still dizzily in love with Darcy (Firth), and he does nothing at all wrong except be just too darn perfect for words.  But we must contrive some conflict, so Bridget concocts stupid sins on his part that even she realizes are stupid, but they are sufficient to create some distance between the two.Look, in romantic comedies we expect a certain amount of cliche and coincidence - it comes with the territory.  But this sequel just isn't true to Bridget.  She learned in the first movie that Darcy really loved her, and she is a smart enough girl that she would never do the idiotic things she does in this movie.  That's one of her most endearing qualities - Bridget is smarter than the thin people in her world realize.  Stupid Bridget just ain't that interesting.In this closed universe of profiteering, the filmmakers are so completely bereft of ideas that no sooner has Darcy left the stage in a semi-huff that Hugh Grant oozes back into Bridget's life, looking for a return to Bridget's arms.  This makes absolutely no sense - here's Grant (it makes no sense to refer to his name - he's playing Hugh Grant), jet-setting around the world for a fun TV show, apparently still sleeping with supermodels, and yet his number one goal seems to be to seduce Bridget.  Whaaaa?  If Grant's purpose was to get revenge on Darcy, then perhaps the movie might have been funny.  Not even Hugh Grant's charm can make this ridiculous character work.We also get lots of contrived scenes demonstrating how the lovable Bridget gets herself into trouble.  When Bridget thinks she's pregnant, not only are the filmmakers content to fall back on the old ""Let's watch the terrible skier fly down the mountain at top speed, leaving a trail of destruction while narrowly escaping death and screaming 'Whoooo!',"" but they have her glide into a pharmacy (yes, a pharmacy) at the bottom of the slope (pretty prime real estate for a pharmacy), where she requests a birth control test, only to realize that she is in the one store in a German tourist town where nobody speaks English.  Hardy har nope.  There's more exercise of similar ""wit,"" including most tastelessly some completely shameless scenes in a Thai women's prison, where the filmmakers think the prisoners can be made to forget their cares and woes with a little Madonna sing-a-long and some lingerie.  Nice.Save your money - do not buy this film.  At best, this movie should be seen by potential filmmakers and storytellers as a cautionary tale of the bad things that can happen to a great idea.",1,Bridget Jones and the Maximizing of Profit,1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,3344,"['original', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'one', 'favorite', 'recent', 'comedies', 'can', 'say', 'even', ""'m"", 'guy', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'led', 'stellar', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'was', 'as', 'committed', 'pitch-perfect', 'little', 'moments', 'was', 'broad', 'laughs', 'big', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'original', 'BJD', 'right', 'there', 'most', 'charming', 'English', 'comedies.But', 'know', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'good', 'ideas', 'nickel', 'be', 'made', 'then', 'nothing', 'sacred.Somehow', 'Zellweger', 'Firth', 'Grant', 'let', 'people', 'talk', 'making', 'absolutely', 'soulless', 'shell', 'sequel', 'Sequel', 'Scale', 'Godfather', 'II', 'top', 'easy', '10', 'Caddyshack', '2', 'zero', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'rates', '1.5', 'concept', 'stupid', 'Bridget', 'still', 'dizzily', 'love', 'Darcy', 'Firth', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'be', 'just', 'too', 'darn', 'perfect', 'words', 'must', 'contrive', 'conflict', 'so', 'Bridget', 'stupid', 'sins', 'part', 'even', 'are', 'stupid', 'are', 'sufficient', 'create', 'distance', 'two.Look', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'expect', 'certain', 'amount', 'cliche', 'coincidence', 'territory', 'sequel', 'just', ""n't"", 'true', 'Bridget', 'learned', 'first', 'movie', 'Darcy', 'really', 'loved', 'smart', 'enough', 'girl', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'idiotic', 'things', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'Bridget', 'smarter', 'thin', 'people', 'world', 'realize', 'Stupid', 'Bridget', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'interesting.In', 'closed', 'universe', 'profiteering', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'so', 'completely', 'bereft', 'ideas', 'sooner', 'Darcy', 'left', 'stage', 'semi-huff', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'back', 'Bridget', 'life', 'looking', 'return', 'Bridget', 'arms', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'here', 'Grant', 'sense', 'refer', 'name', 'playing', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'jet-setting', 'world', 'fun', 'TV', 'show', 'apparently', 'still', 'sleeping', 'supermodels', 'yet', 'number', 'one', 'goal', 'be', 'seduce', 'Bridget', 'Whaaaa', 'Grant', 'purpose', 'was', 'get', 'revenge', 'Darcy', 'then', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'Not', 'even', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'charm', 'can', 'make', 'ridiculous', 'character', 'work.We', 'also', 'get', 'lots', 'contrived', 'scenes', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'lovable', 'Bridget', 'trouble', 'When', 'Bridget', 'pregnant', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'filmmakers', 'content', 'fall', 'back', 'old', 'Let', 'watch', 'terrible', 'skier', 'fly', 'mountain', 'top', 'speed', 'leaving', 'trail', 'destruction', 'narrowly', 'escaping', 'death', 'screaming', 'have', 'glide', 'pharmacy', 'yes', 'pharmacy', 'bottom', 'slope', 'pretty', 'prime', 'real', 'estate', 'pharmacy', 'where', 'birth', 'control', 'test', 'only', 'realize', 'one', 'store', 'German', 'tourist', 'town', 'where', 'nobody', 'English', 'Hardy', 'har', 'nope', 'more', 'exercise', 'similar', 'wit', 'including', 'most', 'tastelessly', 'completely', 'shameless', 'scenes', 'Thai', 'women', 'prison', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'think', 'prisoners', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'forget', 'cares', 'woes', 'little', 'Madonna', 'sing-a-long', 'lingerie', 'Nice.Save', 'money', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'film', 'best', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'potential', 'filmmakers', 'storytellers', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'bad', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'great', 'idea']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

Now, we find them again only a few weeks later, exactly one year after they first met in the buffet organized by Bridget's mother. And guess what, they are there again; another year, another buffet, another diary. This is how we jump into the sequel, and as usually happens, it is not as good as the original; but it still provides us with a fun time.Bridget is working in ""Sit Up Britain"" and is continuously finding herself in ridiculous situations, which do not portray her in a very flattering light, but boosts rating. As happened in the previous movie, we get to listen to her comments on the events that she is going through; comments that are usually pretty funny, but sometimes turn out to be a bit corny.You probably are asking yourself by now, what about Daniel (Grant)? Well, he has a TV show in the same network as Bridget, and even though she does not even want to hear about him anymore, their paths cross when they have to work together on one of the shows. And this happens right when she is thinking about marriage with Mark, but the encounter situation things a bit. And the fact that Mark is working with a very attractive woman does not help in the least.The movie keeps the main characteristics of the winning formula used for the first one, and yes...you will get to see another fight between Daniel and Mark, so do not worry. But some things are funnier the first time around, and that is true in this case too. The creators did add a little variety though, with a little travel that allows for a change of settings, but it is still not enough to compensate for the repeated humor.The cast does a very good job, especially Zellweger, who is perfect for the role and shows a clear ability for portraying a character that constantly makes a fool of herself. The soundtrack is eclectic and fits the movie well, including songs ranging from Barry White to Madonna. Finally, I need to comment on the option of watching the movie with the quiz option, since it is an annoying feature that keeps stopping the film to ask the questions. And on top of that, it has such silly options as answers that my wife decided to quit it and stick with the ""normal"" version of the movie. - 3.5 stars",3,"""And nothing in the world can spoil it""",1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,2348,"['Last', 'time', 'saw', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Zellweger', 'was', 'love', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'Firth', 'were', 'staying', 'together', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'Now', 'find', 'again', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'exactly', 'one', 'year', 'first', 'met', 'buffet', 'organized', 'Bridget', 'mother', 'guess', 'what', 'are', 'there', 'again', 'year', 'buffet', 'diary', 'how', 'jump', 'sequel', 'usually', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'still', 'fun', 'time.Bridget', 'working', 'Sit', 'Up', 'Britain', 'continuously', 'finding', 'ridiculous', 'situations', 'do', 'not', 'portray', 'very', 'flattering', 'light', 'rating', 'happened', 'previous', 'movie', 'get', 'listen', 'comments', 'events', 'going', 'comments', 'are', 'usually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'bit', 'corny.You', 'probably', 'are', 'asking', 'now', 'what', 'Daniel', 'Grant', 'Well', 'TV', 'show', 'same', 'network', 'Bridget', 'even', 'not', 'even', 'want', 'hear', 'anymore', 'paths', 'cross', 'when', 'have', 'work', 'together', 'one', 'shows', 'right', 'when', 'thinking', 'marriage', 'Mark', 'encounter', 'situation', 'things', 'bit', 'fact', 'Mark', 'working', 'very', 'attractive', 'woman', 'not', 'help', 'least.The', 'movie', 'main', 'characteristics', 'winning', 'formula', 'used', 'first', 'one', 'yes', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'fight', 'Daniel', 'Mark', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'worry', 'things', 'are', 'funnier', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'true', 'case', 'too', 'creators', 'did', 'add', 'little', 'variety', 'little', 'travel', 'change', 'settings', 'still', 'not', 'enough', 'compensate', 'repeated', 'humor.The', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'especially', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'perfect', 'role', 'clear', 'ability', 'portraying', 'character', 'constantly', 'fool', 'herself', 'soundtrack', 'eclectic', 'movie', 'well', 'including', 'songs', 'ranging', 'Barry', 'White', 'Madonna', 'Finally', 'need', 'comment', 'option', 'watching', 'movie', 'quiz', 'option', 'annoying', 'feature', 'stopping', 'film', 'ask', 'questions', 'top', 'such', 'silly', 'options', 'answers', 'wife', 'decided', 'quit', 'stick', 'normal', 'version', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

The plotlines are the same - Bridget torn between reserved, uptight, underpant folding lawyer boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and raffish Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who gets all the best lines and, as in the first movie, has far more sex appeal as a cocky, funny womaniser. Bridget obviously finds him irresistable but he keeps blowing his chances with her due his nymphomaniac sex life (in the first movie, his American fiancee got in the way, in this movie he is just about to close the deal when the Thai prostitute he ordered enters his hotel room, prompting the film's funniest line 'I'm up for it if you are' to the unimpressed Bridget). Apart from Hugh Grant the rest of the movie is just a padded out unrolling of the on off romance between Bridget and Mark. Even the actors come across uninspired by the script. Zellweger appears less kookily sparky than in the movie and Colin Firth looks as if he is bored and embarrased with his part (he has publicly admitted that he never wants to act in another Bridget Jones movie). Richard Curtis's material used to be original (when Four Weddings and a Funeral came out eleven years ago) but now his writing resembles a busker playing the same tired old tunes, keeping going only because the money keeps rolling in.

629692,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JNDZ,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","While watching the second 'Bridget Jones' film, about 15 minutes in, I realized that the sequel is not going to be the same kind of romantic comedy.  In short, more comedy and less romance.  Not that the film is bad; it's surely amusing to see it, but in a very different way.  Though the actors are as energetic as ever, slapsticks take the place of the original's character-driven story.When the film starts, we see happy Bridget.  Good for her, but then we remember another Bridget of the original, so miserable in her family's annual Christmas turkey curry buffet.  And then, because of her misery so convincing, we related to her character immediately.  It was a magical touch, which the new film fatally lacks.  Instead, the second film gives us a parody of one classic musical, and a sketch of Bridget's awfully botched TV report among dirty pigs in a dirty pigsty ... oh dear.I am not saying the film is not funny (people were laughing in the theatre, I can tell you).  There are many funny moments in this new 'Bridget Jones' film.  I'm just saying that the film has nothing to add to the original's story that ended four years ago.  Why did they have to make this film anyway?Actually, if there is a good reason to make this sequel, it's to see again perpetual womanizer Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) and listen to his devilishly sweet and hilarious talk, which is, he is clearly aware, total nothing.  Hugh Grant has a strange talent of giving irresistible charms to very empty words, which cast a spell on us too.Compared  with him, the love story of Mark and Bridget are not very intersting.  The film shows, Mark and Bridget must overcome another misunderstanding, but that's exactly they were doing about four years ago.  The writers couldn't find anything new to write about in this new diary, and the film fails to produce the original's natural and spontaneous feelings between them.  And the idea of ""Bridget in Thailand"" and the 'Brokendown Place'-like story is never the right material for the heroine whose delectable personality is most effective when coupled with the British middle-class values, not on the tropical beach.The second 'Bridget' is not all slapsticks -- thanks to four screenwriters including Andrew Davies ('Pride and Prejudice') and Richard Curtis ('Love Actually'), and sure, the dialogues become sometimes lively, but just sometimes.  You probably will notice Richard Curtis's touch, when Bridget mistakes 'Iran' for a person's name.  But witty jokes and intelligence are hard to find in this (unwittingly) ironically titled 'The Edge of Reason.'The film is funny to some extent, but that's because Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, and especially Hugh Grant are doing good job.  The unkind camera often captures the chubby face of Bridget and that's done tactlessly, but thanks to Renee Zellweger the scenes remain watchable.  The gifted players keep the film rolling, and as romantic comedy 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' is entertaining, but not as much as the original.",3,(3.5 Stars) Nothing to Add in Her Diary Except Slapsticks,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,3015,"['watching', 'second', ""'Bridget"", 'Jones', 'film', '15', 'minutes', 'realized', 'sequel', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'same', 'kind', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'short', 'more', 'comedy', 'less', 'romance', 'Not', 'film', 'bad', 'surely', 'amusing', 'see', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'actors', 'are', 'as', 'energetic', 'ever', 'slapsticks', 'take', 'place', 'original', 'character-driven', 'story.When', 'film', 'see', 'happy', 'Bridget', 'Good', 'then', 'remember', 'Bridget', 'original', 'so', 'miserable', 'family', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'turkey', 'curry', 'buffet', 'then', 'misery', 'so', 'convincing', 'related', 'character', 'immediately', 'was', 'magical', 'touch', 'new', 'film', 'fatally', 'Instead', 'second', 'film', 'parody', 'one', 'classic', 'musical', 'sketch', 'Bridget', 'awfully', 'botched', 'TV', 'report', 'dirty', 'pigs', 'dirty', 'pigsty', 'oh', 'dear.I', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'not', 'funny', 'people', 'were', 'laughing', 'theatre', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'new', ""'Bridget"", 'Jones', 'film', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'film', 'nothing', 'add', 'original', 'story', 'ended', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'Why', 'did', 'have', 'make', 'film', 'anyway', 'Actually', 'good', 'reason', 'make', 'sequel', 'see', 'again', 'perpetual', 'womanizer', 'Daniel', 'Cleaver', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'devilishly', 'sweet', 'hilarious', 'talk', 'clearly', 'aware', 'total', 'nothing', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'strange', 'talent', 'giving', 'irresistible', 'charms', 'very', 'empty', 'words', 'cast', 'spell', 'too.Compared', 'love', 'story', 'Mark', 'Bridget', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'intersting', 'film', 'shows', 'Mark', 'Bridget', 'must', 'overcome', 'misunderstanding', 'exactly', 'were', 'doing', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'writers', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'new', 'write', 'about', 'new', 'diary', 'film', 'produce', 'original', 'natural', 'spontaneous', 'feelings', 'idea', 'Bridget', 'Thailand', ""'Brokendown"", ""Place'-like"", 'story', 'never', 'right', 'material', 'heroine', 'delectable', 'personality', 'most', 'effective', 'when', 'coupled', 'British', 'middle-class', 'values', 'not', 'tropical', 'beach.The', 'second', ""'Bridget"", 'not', 'slapsticks', 'thanks', 'four', 'screenwriters', 'including', 'Andrew', 'Davies', ""'Pride"", 'Prejudice', 'Richard', 'Curtis', ""'Love"", 'Actually', 'sure', 'dialogues', 'become', 'sometimes', 'lively', 'just', 'sometimes', 'probably', 'will', 'notice', 'Richard', 'Curtis', 'touch', 'when', 'Bridget', 'person', 'name', 'witty', 'jokes', 'intelligence', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'unwittingly', 'ironically', 'titled', ""'The"", 'Edge', 'Reason', ""'The"", 'film', 'funny', 'extent', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'especially', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'are', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'unkind', 'camera', 'often', 'chubby', 'face', 'Bridget', 'done', 'tactlessly', 'thanks', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'scenes', 'remain', 'watchable', 'gifted', 'players', 'keep', 'film', 'rolling', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Jones', 'Edge', 'Reason', 'entertaining', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'original']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason

629694,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JNDZ,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","Movies usually don't turn out better than the books they are based upon. Movie sequels, unless part of a trilogy, rarely turn out better than the original movies. However, movie sequels based upon book sequels usually turn out better (see THE LOST WORLD for example). BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON isn't one of those cases. In fact, it's the exact opposite. This movie is an example of what happens when you make a copy of a copy a couple of times over. The original film adaptation of BRIDGET JONES was a joy to watch and in many ways improved upon the original novel. However, the book sequel was a disappointment and this movie sequel is a pure disaster. The film is one of the worst movies I have seen in a theatre in a long time and if it wasn't for the presence of Colin Firth, it wouldn't be worth watching ever.The first film stayed fairly close to the novel. This movie doesn't. That's not necessarily bad, especially seeing that the novel's sequel is inferior to the original writing as well. However, the way the filmmakers chose to veer away from the novel's plot is just so wrong. From the commuted stay and sentence in Thailand with very little background information to the turning of Bridget's nemesis Rebecca into a lesbian out to seduce her and not Mark Darcy to the complete disappearance of certain important events, situations, and people (e.g. naked housekeeper's son, the party at the summer house, Wellington) the book rarely uses the original text as an outline. Like I mentioned before, that's not necessarily bad, but instead of straying away from the text to improve upon it, the book swerves completely away.Then of course there are all the extras that were added. Supposedly to make the script more interesting: Bridget trying to buy a pregnancy test somewhere in, Austria I guess. Or how about the fistfight between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant--the only reason that scene is even in the movie is so the directors could have some excuse to have Colin Firth fall in a fountain of water again and get soaking wet so that the ladies of England would lick their lips. Scenes like these add nothing to the story whatsoever. Not only that, they aren't even funny; not in a typical American-type ha-ha-funny, not in the usual droll British guffaw type funny. The only people who would get a serious laugh out of those scenes are people who aren't going to be watching the movie (the REAL WORLD/MTV crowed will be watching things like AMERICAN PIE, not BRIDGET JONES) to begin with. So why even bother to putt them in as filler?Besides all that, there's also the actors' enthusiasm. In the first movie, everyone seemed liked the must have really had a good time making the movie. In THE EDGE OF REASON, everyone but Colin Firth seems like they are just there to pick up a paycheck. Renee Zellweger is a very talented actress who is one of my favorites and one an Oscar nod for her first performance. In this movie, Zellweger appears as though all the weight gaining/loosing/gaining and other physical demands she has placed upon herself have gotten to her. Bridget no longer seems perky and adorable, but down and almost pathetic. Colin Firth does the best job out of all the actors, but even he at times seems like he's just walking through the paces following the tape on the floor. It just goes to show, if you're going to copy a copy of a copy of a copy, change it up a little bit and make it more original.

No longer is Bridget funny and charming, she is just an embarrassment to watch.The sequel starts out ok, but quickly relies on subplot after subplot to keep the viewer interested.  This actually made the film rather annoying as you constantly had to focus on yet another storyline happening.  Perhaps the director could tell the film wasn't working and wrote in more subplots.To me, the main problem with the film is that Bridget is no longer funny. You can only stretch the fat jokes so far. Also, the scene where she stormed into Darcy's chambers with a wet dress and hair was just too far fetched and not credible.  It was supposed to be funny, but ended up being a poor attempt by the Director to make us believe that a man of Darcy's calibre would be interested in a woman who storms in when he is in a meeting with his colleagues.  A similar scene occurs in the first ten minutes of the film.Hugh Grant's brief appearance in the film was an attempt to recapture the magic of the first. It failed.

That's what I wanted to ask when this one came out in theaters. Some movies are better if no sequels were made. This one obviously wanted to make more money when the script is really not as interesting and funny as the first one. Apparently, Renee Zellwegger got paid like twenty times more money for this film than the first. The hundreds of donuts, cheese cakes and pizzas she had to eat to gain the 30lbs really showed in this film. She's very ""striking"" in one scene when she wore a tight fitting gold colour evening gown. Talk about the waistline of BJ. Well, we got to give the American Texan the credit for the stunning transformation, and the British accent is still right on.So we know that she found the love of her life in BJ Diary. Colin Firth reprises the role of Mark Darcy, the future husband of BJ,since they have moved in together. Their relationship looks picture perfect at first, but jealousy and insecurity took over BJ's mind when she mistaken him for cheating with a tall and beautiful assistant. Bridget gets pregnant, and Darcy was very happy and decided to propose to her. Then Daniel(Hugh Grant) reappeared in BJ's life, and they spent some time together in a journalism partnership in Thailand. Bridget's life is at a chaotic state when she was mistaken by the customs for carrying drugs in her luggage, and who will bail her out before she faces possible imprisonment.....There's many attempts on jokes in this movie. They did Madonna's Like A Virgin and Material Girl in the prison scenes, but it didn't provoke much laughters like BJ did when she did All By Myself in the first film. Darcy and Daniel also get to have a man-to-man fight over BJ again, but we know Daniel is not the man for Bridget, because her heart belongs Darcy.Hugh Grant had limited screentime here, and didn't have much chemistry with Zellwegger. Colin Firth is good as a calm and sophisticated high class gentleman/lawyer(a true ladies man). As for Renee Zellwegger, she's tried her best at being funny, and touching while maintaining her British persona, but the role has lost it's zest compared to the first BJ. Hopefully we won't have to see her playing overweight and English again for a while.",3,A Man For All Reasons.,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,2296,"['Was', 'too', 'late', 'make', 'sequel', 'adorable', 'Bridget', ""Jones'Diary"", 'more', '3', 'years', 'what', 'wanted', 'ask', 'when', 'one', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'sequels', 'were', 'made', 'one', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'when', 'script', 'really', 'not', 'interesting', 'funny', 'first', 'one', 'Apparently', 'Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'got', 'paid', 'twenty', 'times', 'more', 'money', 'film', 'first', 'hundreds', 'donuts', 'cheese', 'cakes', 'pizzas', 'had', 'eat', 'gain', '30lbs', 'really', 'showed', 'film', 'very', 'striking', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'wore', 'tight', 'fitting', 'gold', 'colour', 'evening', 'gown', 'Talk', 'waistline', 'BJ', 'Well', 'got', 'give', 'American', 'Texan', 'credit', 'stunning', 'transformation', 'British', 'accent', 'still', 'right', 'know', 'found', 'love', 'life', 'BJ', 'Diary', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'role', 'Mark', 'Darcy', 'future', 'husband', 'BJ', 'have', 'moved', 'together', 'relationship', 'picture', 'perfect', 'first', 'jealousy', 'insecurity', 'took', 'over', 'BJ', 'mind', 'when', 'mistaken', 'cheating', 'tall', 'beautiful', 'assistant', 'Bridget', 'pregnant', 'Darcy', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'decided', 'propose', 'Then', 'Daniel', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'reappeared', 'BJ', 'life', 'spent', 'time', 'together', 'journalism', 'partnership', 'Thailand', 'Bridget', 'life', 'chaotic', 'state', 'when', 'was', 'mistaken', 'customs', 'carrying', 'drugs', 'luggage', 'who', 'will', 'bail', 'out', 'possible', 'imprisonment', 'many', 'attempts', 'jokes', 'movie', 'did', 'Madonna', 'A', 'Virgin', 'Material', 'Girl', 'prison', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'provoke', 'much', 'laughters', 'BJ', 'did', 'when', 'did', 'Myself', 'first', 'film', 'Darcy', 'Daniel', 'also', 'get', 'have', 'man-to-man', 'fight', 'BJ', 'again', 'know', 'Daniel', 'not', 'man', 'Bridget', 'heart', 'Darcy.Hugh', 'Grant', 'had', 'limited', 'screentime', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'chemistry', 'Zellwegger', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'good', 'calm', 'sophisticated', 'high', 'class', 'gentleman/lawyer', 'true', 'ladies', 'man', 'Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'tried', 'best', 'being', 'funny', 'touching', 'maintaining', 'British', 'persona', 'role', 'lost', 'zest', 'compared', 'first', 'BJ', 'Hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'playing', 'overweight', 'English', 'again', 'while']",Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason
