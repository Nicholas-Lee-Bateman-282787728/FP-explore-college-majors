1443376,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0055V0K7M,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Really, the only thing that saves On Strike For Christmas is the original storyline.  None of the acting is spectacular by any stretch but totally serves its purpose for the Lifetime Movie Network, and the humor is always really basic and Brady Bunch-like.  However, you know, sometimes an innocent movie like this is a breath of fresh air in a world full of corruption and violence (Bad Santa anyone?) so with that in mind -despite the extremely awful start- On Strike For Christmas is actually pretty decent viewing material.It's about a mother/wife that reaches a point of being COMPLETELY fed up with her selfish husband and two inconsiderate sons since they seem to expect the woman of the house to handle all the Christmas shopping, decorating and cooking.  So... she comes up with this idea to literally go on strike and make THEM do all the work!  Really interesting idea, and the movie is honestly interesting enough to warrant a 3.5 rating which is good in my book, so with that said, I did enjoy my time watching this movie.  My favorite part by FAR is the husband/father and two sons attempting to make cookies in the kitchen, LOL!  They can understand directions and bake treats about as well as I can!  Yes that's right- I burn the bottoms too, lol.A pretty original storyline saves it, and I really do recommend it for 90 minutes of innocent fun.  Perhaps the ending stinks since it's so predictable and lacks excitement, but other than that, worth watching with the family.  I just KNOW however, that a woman came up with this concept!  Perhaps several ladies that threatened to go on strike for the holidays!  Daphne Zuniga is really attractive too.  No WAY she's 50 years old!  I guess it sort of bothers me that her name is Joy in the film.  Come on that's too silly and obvious for a Christmas-themed movie, haha.",3,I wish I was on strike too,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,1833,"['Really', 'only', 'thing', 'Strike', 'Christmas', 'original', 'storyline', 'None', 'acting', 'spectacular', 'stretch', 'totally', 'purpose', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'humor', 'always', 'really', 'basic', 'Brady', 'Bunch-like', 'However', 'know', 'sometimes', 'innocent', 'movie', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'world', 'full', 'corruption', 'violence', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'anyone', 'so', 'mind', '-despite', 'extremely', 'awful', 'start-', 'Strike', 'Christmas', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'viewing', 'material.It', 'mother/wife', 'point', 'being', 'COMPLETELY', 'fed', 'up', 'selfish', 'husband', 'two', 'inconsiderate', 'sons', 'seem', 'expect', 'woman', 'house', 'handle', 'Christmas', 'shopping', 'decorating', 'cooking', 'up', 'idea', 'literally', 'go', 'strike', 'make', 'THEM', 'do', 'work', 'Really', 'interesting', 'idea', 'movie', 'honestly', 'interesting', 'enough', 'warrant', '3.5', 'rating', 'good', 'book', 'so', 'said', 'did', 'enjoy', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'favorite', 'part', 'FAR', 'husband/father', 'two', 'sons', 'attempting', 'make', 'cookies', 'kitchen', 'LOL', 'can', 'understand', 'directions', 'bake', 'treats', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'Yes', 'right-', 'burn', 'bottoms', 'too', 'lol.A', 'pretty', 'original', 'storyline', 'really', 'do', 'recommend', '90', 'minutes', 'innocent', 'fun', 'Perhaps', 'ending', 'stinks', 'so', 'predictable', 'lacks', 'excitement', 'other', 'worth', 'watching', 'family', 'just', 'KNOW', 'however', 'woman', 'came', 'up', 'concept', 'Perhaps', 'several', 'ladies', 'threatened', 'go', 'strike', 'holidays', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'really', 'attractive', 'too', 'WAY', '50', 'years', 'old', 'guess', 'sort', 'bothers', 'name', 'Joy', 'film', 'Come', 'too', 'silly', 'obvious', 'Christmas-themed', 'movie', 'haha']",On Strike for Christmas

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","- Stephen (to his kids during a disastrous cookie-baking incident): ""Look, your mom is gonna be home right after the shop closes, and we still haven't toasted our nuts.""- Mark: ""Dad, don't ever say that again.""- Jeremy (to Dad): ""You're so weird.""Joy Robertson (Daphne Zuniga), domestic goddess, is a micro-manager. Her husband and two teenaged sons are so used to her being so capable that they tend to dismiss her quiet pleas for help. This is the Robertsons' last Christmas together as the kids, Jeremy and Mark, are set to go to college. So Joy really wants this Christmas to be super-special. The movie starts ten days until Christmas.Joy's running behind, and she's starting to fret some. Getting the tree, let alone decorating it and the rest of the house, keeps getting postponed. Doesn't help that her teacher/writer hubbie, Stephen (David Sutcliffe), out of the blue expects her to host his school's English Dept. holiday party and that Jeremy is suddenly asking her to bake cookies for the football banquet. And, by the way, Joy also happens to run her own fabric shop, The Knittery, so it's not like domestic goddessing is all she does.Eight days until Christmas, Joy is utterly swamped and has just about had it with getting taken for granted, fed up with her boys' always breaking their promises to help her Christmas preparations. And so, seven days until Christmas, Joy goes on strike. And then the movie really starts.ON STRIKE FOR CHRISTMAS (2010), based on Sheila Roberts' book, turns out to be a breezy watch during the holidays and more fun than I thought it would be. Daphne Zuniga keeps it together, keeps it grounded as the long-suffering mom who finally puts down her foot. And maybe holiday strikes are contagious because Joy's knitting club soon joins her on strike, her pals also mightily fed up with their inconsiderate men. And when one of her pals, a journalist for the local paper, features her plight in a human interest column and then that story goes viral, well, things escalate into a city-wide battle of the sexes. Joy, hey, you're suddenly a rallying point!It wouldn't be much of a story if the Robertson boys didn't feel the need to prove Joy wrong. We know it's coming, but it still induces big grins, watching the guys try to handle their business in the kitchen. Their first project:  to bake cookies, cookies that, when all's said and done, taste like - to quote one of the kids - ""biological weapons."" Oh, it's a mess, that kitchen. And then the story conflict ratchets up even more when they get the chance to tell their side of the story in that same local paper. Oh, I shuddered when the article quoted Stephen as referring to Joy as ""Yulezilla.""It's a light comedy and it's set during the holidays, so odds are, that happy ending is lurking 'round the corner. I think this is a well-done movie with several madcap moments. The premise turns your head. The gags are staged well, with amusing pay-offs. Equally important, there's a warmth to these proceedings. The sense we get is that even though Joy is on strike and the men are trying to show her up, the reconciliation isn't too far coming. But, man, I never knew separating the egg's yolk from the egg's white was so damn hard.",4,"""You're a scary dude, mom.""",1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,3229,"['Stephen', 'kids', 'disastrous', 'cookie-baking', 'incident', 'Look', 'mom', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'home', 'right', 'shop', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'toasted', 'nuts', 'Mark', 'Dad', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'say', 'again', 'Jeremy', 'Dad', ""'re"", 'so', 'weird', 'Joy', 'Robertson', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'domestic', 'goddess', 'micro-manager', 'husband', 'two', 'teenaged', 'sons', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'being', 'so', 'capable', 'tend', 'dismiss', 'quiet', 'pleas', 'help', 'Robertsons', 'last', 'Christmas', 'together', 'kids', 'Jeremy', 'Mark', 'are', 'set', 'go', 'college', 'So', 'Joy', 'really', 'Christmas', 'be', 'super-special', 'movie', 'ten', 'days', 'Christmas.Joy', 'running', 'behind', 'starting', 'fret', 'Getting', 'tree', 'let', 'alone', 'decorating', 'rest', 'house', 'getting', 'postponed', ""n't"", 'help', 'teacher/writer', 'hubbie', 'Stephen', 'David', 'Sutcliffe', 'blue', 'host', 'school', 'English', 'Dept', 'holiday', 'party', 'Jeremy', 'suddenly', 'asking', 'bake', 'cookies', 'football', 'banquet', 'way', 'Joy', 'also', 'run', 'own', 'fabric', 'shop', 'Knittery', 'not', 'like', 'domestic', 'goddessing', 'does.Eight', 'days', 'Christmas', 'Joy', 'utterly', 'swamped', 'just', 'about', 'had', 'getting', 'taken', 'granted', 'fed', 'up', 'boys', 'always', 'breaking', 'promises', 'help', 'Christmas', 'preparations', 'so', 'seven', 'days', 'Christmas', 'Joy', 'strike', 'then', 'movie', 'really', 'STRIKE', 'FOR', 'CHRISTMAS', '2010', 'based', 'Sheila', 'Roberts', 'book', 'out', 'be', 'breezy', 'watch', 'holidays', 'more', 'fun', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'together', 'grounded', 'long-suffering', 'mom', 'who', 'finally', 'down', 'foot', 'maybe', 'holiday', 'strikes', 'are', 'contagious', 'Joy', 'knitting', 'club', 'soon', 'strike', 'pals', 'also', 'mightily', 'fed', 'up', 'inconsiderate', 'men', 'when', 'one', 'pals', 'journalist', 'local', 'paper', 'plight', 'human', 'interest', 'column', 'then', 'story', 'viral', 'well', 'things', 'escalate', 'city-wide', 'battle', 'sexes', 'Joy', 'hey', ""'re"", 'suddenly', 'rallying', 'point', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'story', 'Robertson', 'boys', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'prove', 'Joy', 'wrong', 'know', 'coming', 'still', 'big', 'grins', 'watching', 'guys', 'try', 'handle', 'business', 'kitchen', 'first', 'project', 'bake', 'cookies', 'cookies', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'taste', 'quote', 'one', 'kids', 'biological', 'weapons', 'Oh', 'mess', 'kitchen', 'then', 'story', 'conflict', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'get', 'chance', 'tell', 'side', 'story', 'same', 'local', 'paper', 'Oh', 'shuddered', 'when', 'article', 'quoted', 'Stephen', 'referring', 'Joy', 'Yulezilla', 'light', 'comedy', 'set', 'holidays', 'odds', 'are', 'happy', 'ending', 'lurking', 'corner', 'think', 'well-done', 'movie', 'several', 'madcap', 'moments', 'premise', 'head', 'gags', 'are', 'staged', 'well', 'amusing', 'pay-offs', 'Equally', 'important', 'warmth', 'proceedings', 'sense', 'get', 'even', 'Joy', 'strike', 'men', 'are', 'trying', 'show', 'up', 'reconciliation', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'coming', 'man', 'never', 'knew', 'separating', 'egg', 'yolk', 'egg', 'white', 'was', 'so', 'damn', 'hard']",On Strike for Christmas

Still, I was intrigued to see the movie and see what they did with it. What a difference. I realize that Christmas is always going to have sad times as that is human nature, but I was relieved the screenwriters and/or directors/producers decided to dump the parts of the book that made it so dreary. This movie was quite funny at times and very enjoyable. I am usually skeptical of TV movies for fear of cheesy, silly acting (as was ""The Dog that Saved Halloween... but that is another review). The actors have a modicum of talent, especially Daphne. She is not overdramatic as an actress in this movie, although sometimes she has the right to be and still can underplay it while appropriately being horrified.Essentially the story can appeal to every woman who has ever had to put together a holiday entirely by herself. In this case, Joy (Daphne Zuniga) is doing all the work to get her family ready for Christmas. She is doing the baking, the decorating, the tree, the shopping and all the party and meal planning that goes with Christmas. Her lovely husband and two older sons (I assumer are 17 or 18 because they are going off to college) sit back and watch her do all this. She makes lists of simple tasks for all to do (buy new Christmas lights, get decorations from gargage, stuff like that) and none of this gets done. So the men are left to fend for themselves as she decides to strike and chaos ensues. They apparently live in a never named small town in California and news of Joy's strike spread quickly and soon all the women in town are soon on strike.Other reviewers labeled this movie predictable, and it is, but I tell you the scene where the dad and the boys make cookies makes this movie well worth the admission price, or at least 90 minutes of your time to watch it.
