First you have the semi-serious dark comedy starring Eisenberg and Danny McBride, who both give fairly nuanced performances. If the route these two actors had taken had been followed by the writer and other cast members, this MIGHT have been a decent movie. Instead, we get the predictable goofy roommate, played by Ansari, who is a Chris Rock level of horrible actor, some extremely infantile violence-laced humor, and the most idioticly unrealistic ending I've seen in ages. This movie is not just stupid, but assumes that the audience is stupid as well.This is based on a true story that is FAR more interesting than what we get. Of course, in real life, the pizza delivery guy died a horrible death, so a comedy might be a hard sell.

1373664,AAZRWLML88IZK,B003Y5H5C4,A kids review,"[2, 5]","Back in 2009, director Ruben Fleischer burst onto the scene with a bona fide hit in Zombieland, an uproarious take on the zombie flick genre that won both critical acclaim and big box office receipts and marked Fleischer as one to keep an eye on. 30 Minutes or Less, Fleischer's second feature, was therefore something of a disappointment for many. Loosely based on a true story, 30 Minutes or Less was marred by some controversy over the fact that it made light of events that, in reality, ended in tragedy, but that was only part of the reason I was left a bit unimpressed. Despite a talented cast, the narrative -- about a typical pizza delivery guy who's forced by dimwitted crooks to rob a bank with a bomb strapped to his chest -- is disjointed, and makes the mistake of substituting crude gags for true lowbrow humor; I therefore award it a mere one star. The film is funny in spots, and the actors certainly know how to pull their weight, so you may get some mileage out of the film, but don't expect anything on the level of Zombieland.",1,30 Minutes or Less,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1045,"['Back', '2009', 'director', 'Ruben', 'Fleischer', 'burst', 'scene', 'bona', 'fide', 'hit', 'Zombieland', 'uproarious', 'take', 'zombie', 'flick', 'genre', 'won', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'marked', 'Fleischer', 'one', 'keep', 'eye', '30', 'Minutes', 'Less', 'Fleischer', 'second', 'feature', 'was', 'therefore', 'something', 'disappointment', 'many', 'Loosely', 'based', 'true', 'story', '30', 'Minutes', 'Less', 'was', 'marred', 'controversy', 'fact', 'made', 'light', 'events', 'reality', 'ended', 'tragedy', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'reason', 'was', 'left', 'bit', 'unimpressed', 'talented', 'cast', 'narrative', 'typical', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'guy', 'who', 'forced', 'dimwitted', 'crooks', 'rob', 'bank', 'bomb', 'strapped', 'chest', 'disjointed', 'mistake', 'substituting', 'crude', 'gags', 'true', 'lowbrow', 'humor', 'therefore', 'mere', 'one', 'star', 'film', 'funny', 'spots', 'actors', 'certainly', 'know', 'how', 'pull', 'weight', 'may', 'get', 'mileage', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'level', 'Zombieland']",30 Minutes or Less

1373668,A2582KMXLK2P06,B003Y5H5C4,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","30 Minutes or Less is a really good comedy/suspense.  It's about Jesse Eisenberg playing the part of a pizza delivery boy who happens to deliver a pizza to the wrong house one night involving two nerdy out of shape young men who come up with this scheme to kidnap Jesse's character and deliberately make him go through with a bank robbery.  These men also contact a hitman in case the robbery doesn't succeed for whatever reason, and the hitman plays a huge role in the movie near the end.This is definitely more a comedy than a suspense, that's for sure!  I was laughing pretty much the entire time.  Jesse brings along his friend Aziz Ansari who's equally funny and finds himself in all kinds of comedy segments as well.  Basically the storyline is hilarious because it revolves around several familiar bank robbery/money delivering antics that go *completely* wrong.  A twist on the genre if you will.  A good example is when Jesse and Aziz walk into a bank, tells everyone to get on the floor and when it's discovered one woman has a gun, she tosses it across the room and an innocent man gets shot when the gun hits the counter, which prompts him to yells at HER and therefore takes the attention away from the robbers, lol.Oh, and did I mention Jesse has a bomb strapped to his chest the entire time?  Yeah that's an important element to the storyline!  Sometimes the bomb is used as a way to gain an advantage which you'll find out about later.  Good writing there.  There's several swear words being tossed around, especially by the father of the two guys who come up with the bank robbery plan.  The father had me rolling on the floor with laughter because of his strict military-like demeanor and the ways he'd constantly belittle his own son and his friend, lol.Overall hilarious, well-told and just a lot of fun.  That pretty much describes 30 Minutes or Less... and this review only took me less than 10 minutes to write.",5,"haha, awesome!",1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,1934,"['30', 'Minutes', 'Less', 'really', 'good', 'comedy/suspense', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'playing', 'part', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'boy', 'who', 'deliver', 'pizza', 'wrong', 'house', 'one', 'night', 'involving', 'two', 'nerdy', 'shape', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'scheme', 'kidnap', 'Jesse', 'character', 'deliberately', 'make', 'go', 'bank', 'robbery', 'men', 'also', 'contact', 'hitman', 'case', 'robbery', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'reason', 'hitman', 'huge', 'role', 'movie', 'end.This', 'definitely', 'more', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'sure', 'was', 'laughing', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'time', 'Jesse', 'friend', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'who', 'equally', 'funny', 'kinds', 'comedy', 'segments', 'well', 'Basically', 'storyline', 'hilarious', 'several', 'familiar', 'bank', 'robbery/money', 'delivering', 'antics', 'go', '*completely*', 'wrong', 'twist', 'genre', 'will', 'A', 'good', 'example', 'when', 'Jesse', 'Aziz', 'walk', 'bank', 'everyone', 'get', 'floor', 'when', 'discovered', 'one', 'woman', 'gun', 'room', 'innocent', 'man', 'shot', 'when', 'gun', 'counter', 'yells', 'HER', 'therefore', 'attention', 'away', 'robbers', 'lol.Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'Jesse', 'bomb', 'strapped', 'chest', 'entire', 'time', 'Yeah', 'important', 'element', 'storyline', 'Sometimes', 'bomb', 'used', 'way', 'gain', 'advantage', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'about', 'later', 'Good', 'writing', 'there', 'several', 'swear', 'words', 'being', 'tossed', 'especially', 'father', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'bank', 'robbery', 'plan', 'father', 'had', 'rolling', 'floor', 'laughter', 'strict', 'military-like', 'demeanor', 'ways', ""'d"", 'constantly', 'belittle', 'own', 'son', 'friend', 'lol.Overall', 'hilarious', 'well-told', 'just', 'lot', 'fun', 'pretty', 'much', '30', 'Minutes', 'Less', 'review', 'only', 'took', 'less', '10', 'minutes', 'write']",30 Minutes or Less

1373673,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B003Y5H5C4,C. Sawin,"[7, 9]","THIS DOES CONTAIN SOME SPOILERSRuben Fleischer's first directorial effort, Zombieland, was met with both critic acclaim and fan appraisal. There seem to be far fewer people who disliked Zombieland compared to those who enjoyed it. Zombieland was quite entertaining though; its cast was incredibly well-rounded, it offered a new spin on a story we've seen dozens of times before, and most of all it offered humor and sharp wit during what is otherwise the end of the world; a time when you least expected it. Zombieland was something special. However, 30 Minutes or Less seems like a completely different type of comedy. The trailers lead you to believe it could go either way; one way being extremely hilarious and the other ending with you kicking yourself because you didn't just wait to rent it. Even after seeing the movie, 30 Minutes or Less still manages to fall somewhere in the middle of that generalization.30 Minutes or Less starts off pretty strong. The dialogue is really funny, you can feel the chemistry between the actors, and the storyline is progressing at a steady pace. It seems like it's on track to be this fantastically amusing R-rated comedy that's one of the funniest films of the year, but it begins to lose steam after the bank robbery. It's like the humor begins to lose its wit and becomes more about bickering between the duos Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) and Chet (Aziz Ansari) and Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson). By the end of the movie, you'll wonder how a pizza deliveryman who does nothing but smoke pot, drink, play video games, and watch action movies who's never amounted to anything his entire life can rob a bank, get away with it, and be as smart as he is about the entire situation. Is it years of untapped potential finally bubbling to the surface or a giant plot hole? You'll have to be the judge of that.There seems to be a plethora of plot devices added in the second half of the movie that hurts it overall. A pen gun, a hired gun getting his own side story, a romance, the potential tan salon Dwayne and Travis won't stop talking about, police chases, the leverage changing hands several times, and flamethrowers all entering the picture, it all becomes too much to process. Trying to juggle that many scenes only results in a movie like this stumbling in its attempted execution.The cast is 30 Minutes or Less finest asset. The writing certainly has its moments, but the actors are what make the movie as entertaining as it is. Jesse Eisenberg portrays that same sharp wit you've come to expect from the actor. Meanwhile Danny McBride gives one of his best performances. McBride tends to be utilized so well as a supporting character. All of his qualities seem to shine brightest when he's not the main character. It's one of the reasons Your Highness didn't work out. Nick Swardson plays up the bomb expert/second fiddle to Dwayne role incredibly well. He's more intelligent than he lets on and the scene where he's unleashing his kicks in front of a tied up and bomb straddled Nick is probably his funniest in the movie. Last but not least, there's Michael Pe&ntilde;a who's the one character in the movie who can get laughs just by the way he talks alone. His ""pimp"" scene in the mirror is quite amusing. You may have noticed I left out Aziz Ansari and that's mostly because it felt like he wasn't very funny at all. He had a few one-liners that are snicker-worthy, but seemed to ruin it by running it into the ground and just overdoing it in general.The other disheartening thing about 30 Minutes or Less is the way it ends. It doesn't feel like a conclusion since everything just kind of stops. The movie ends with a laugh and has a pretty ridiculous scene after the credits, but it leaves so many unanswered questions. It was probably left open for a possible sequel, which would probably just completely ruin what limited appeal this comedy has.30 Minutes or Less is fast paced, action packed, and even downright hilarious at times. Unfortunately, it doesn't keep up the momentum it first starts off with. The humor becomes stale, the actors tend to get caught up in being silly rather than moving the story along, and action takes a front seat in the second half while the comedy takes a hit, but 30 Minutes or Less is still fairly amusing and at least worth a rental in the long run.",3,Falls short of being as great as it first lets on,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,4353,"['THIS', 'DOES', 'CONTAIN', 'SOME', 'SPOILERSRuben', 'Fleischer', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Zombieland', 'was', 'met', 'critic', 'acclaim', 'fan', 'appraisal', 'seem', 'be', 'far', 'fewer', 'people', 'who', 'disliked', 'Zombieland', 'compared', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Zombieland', 'was', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'cast', 'was', 'incredibly', 'well-rounded', 'offered', 'new', 'spin', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozens', 'times', 'most', 'offered', 'humor', 'sharp', 'wit', 'what', 'otherwise', 'end', 'world', 'time', 'when', 'least', 'expected', 'Zombieland', 'was', 'something', 'special', 'However', '30', 'Minutes', 'Less', 'completely', 'different', 'type', 'comedy', 'trailers', 'lead', 'believe', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'one', 'way', 'being', 'extremely', 'hilarious', 'other', 'ending', 'kicking', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'wait', 'rent', 'Even', 'seeing', 'movie', '30', 'Minutes', 'Less', 'still', 'fall', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'generalization.30', 'Less', 'pretty', 'strong', 'dialogue', 'really', 'funny', 'can', 'feel', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'storyline', 'progressing', 'steady', 'pace', 'track', 'be', 'fantastically', 'amusing', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', 'year', 'lose', 'steam', 'bank', 'robbery', 'humor', 'lose', 'wit', 'more', 'bickering', 'duos', 'Nick', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'Chet', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'Dwayne', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'Travis', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'end', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'how', 'pizza', 'deliveryman', 'who', 'nothing', 'smoke', 'pot', 'drink', 'play', 'video', 'games', 'watch', 'action', 'movies', 'who', 'never', 'amounted', 'anything', 'entire', 'life', 'can', 'rob', 'bank', 'get', 'away', 'be', 'as', 'smart', 'entire', 'situation', 'years', 'untapped', 'potential', 'finally', 'bubbling', 'surface', 'giant', 'plot', 'hole', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'judge', 'that.There', 'be', 'plethora', 'plot', 'devices', 'added', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'overall', 'pen', 'gun', 'hired', 'gun', 'getting', 'own', 'side', 'story', 'romance', 'potential', 'tan', 'salon', 'Dwayne', 'Travis', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'talking', 'police', 'chases', 'leverage', 'changing', 'hands', 'several', 'times', 'flamethrowers', 'entering', 'picture', 'too', 'much', 'process', 'Trying', 'juggle', 'many', 'scenes', 'only', 'results', 'movie', 'stumbling', 'attempted', 'execution.The', 'cast', '30', 'Minutes', 'Less', 'finest', 'asset', 'writing', 'certainly', 'moments', 'actors', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'as', 'entertaining', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'same', 'sharp', 'wit', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'actor', 'Meanwhile', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'McBride', 'be', 'utilized', 'so', 'well', 'supporting', 'character', 'qualities', 'seem', 'shine', 'brightest', 'when', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'one', 'reasons', 'Highness', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'up', 'bomb', 'expert/second', 'fiddle', 'Dwayne', 'role', 'incredibly', 'well', 'more', 'intelligent', 'scene', 'where', 'unleashing', 'kicks', 'front', 'tied', 'bomb', 'straddled', 'Nick', 'probably', 'funniest', 'movie', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'who', 'one', 'character', 'movie', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'laughs', 'just', 'way', 'alone', 'pimp', 'scene', 'mirror', 'quite', 'amusing', 'may', 'have', 'noticed', 'left', 'out', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'mostly', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'had', 'few', 'one-liners', 'are', 'snicker-worthy', 'seemed', 'ruin', 'running', 'ground', 'just', 'overdoing', 'general.The', 'other', 'disheartening', 'thing', '30', 'Minutes', 'Less', 'way', ""n't"", 'feel', 'conclusion', 'everything', 'just', 'kind', 'stops', 'movie', 'laugh', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'credits', 'so', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'was', 'probably', 'left', 'open', 'possible', 'sequel', 'would', 'probably', 'just', 'completely', 'ruin', 'what', 'limited', 'appeal', 'comedy', 'has.30', 'Minutes', 'Less', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'packed', 'even', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'times', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'momentum', 'first', 'humor', 'stale', 'actors', 'tend', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'being', 'silly', 'rather', 'moving', 'story', 'action', 'front', 'seat', 'second', 'half', 'comedy', 'hit', '30', 'Minutes', 'Less', 'still', 'fairly', 'amusing', 'least', 'rental', 'long', 'run']",30 Minutes or Less

1373679,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003Y5H5C4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","From producer Ben Stiller, Stuart Cornfeld and Jeremy Kramer comes the 2011 film ""30 Minutes or Less"".A crazy action/comedy film directed by Ruben Fleischer (""Zombieland"") and a film which reunites the director with actor Jesse Eisenberg (""The Social Network"",""Zombieland"", ""Adventureland"") and features a screenplay from writers Michael Diliberti and Matthew Sullivan.The film which was budgeted at $28 million, earned over $39 million in the box office.VIDEO:""30 Minutes or Less"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and picture quality is absolutely fantastic.  You can see the details from the whiskers in Aziz' beard to the details of Nick's crappy old car, the skin pores of Bianca Kajlich's nude body.  A lot of fine details through the closeups and also, the film has some grain, skin tones are natural, some colorful scenes are vibrant (from the red car that Nick and Chet had stolen to the flames of a flamethrower) and black levels are nice and deep.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""30 Minutes or Less"" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Audio Description Track 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The lossless soundtrack is actually quite solid for this comedy/action film.  From the bass-driven hip hop tracks to the explosions, car crashes, gun shots, there are moments of really good immersive sound and good use of the surround channels.  While the film is primarily dialogue, you do get a good amount of ambiance especially during the scenes with a lot of people (the bank scene), but the film does showcase quite a bit of music from hip-hop to the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" Glenn Frey song ""The Heat is On"".Overall, a pretty solid lossless soundtrack.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""30 Minutes or Less"" comes with the following special features:Picture-in-Picture Video Commentary with Actors Jesse Eisenberg, Aziz Ansari, Danny McBride, Nick Swardson and Director Ruben Fleischer - A fun picture-in-picture audio commentary discussing  the improvisational scenes, shooting on location and information about their characters and challenges of shooting the film and more.Blowing Up with the Cast & Crew of 30 Minutes or Less - (14:08) The cast and crew talk about the improvisational moments of the film and the various talent involved in the film.The Perfect Crime: Action and Comedy in 30 Minutes Or Less (10:58) The cast and crew talk about the action and comedy of the film, behind-the-scenes footage and more.Deleted Scenes - (11:40) Featuring nine deleted scenes: Christopher Fires and Then Rehires Nick, Nick Wakes Up Late/Rear View Mirror, Dwayne and Travis Raid the Fridge, Dwayne's Dream Sequence, Nick Throws-Up at Side of Road, Nick and Chet Leave School/Chet Calls in Excuse, Chango F&(@$ Juicy, Nick Chases Chet, Dwayne Finds Major Wounded, and Vito's Commercial.Outtakes - (6:14) Featuring three improvisational outtakes - Travis Thinks the Major is Jacked, Chet Tells Nick Worse Ways To Die, Dwayne and Travis Talk Tanning Codes30 Minutes or Less PS3 Theme/Wallpaper - If you have a Sony PlayStation 3, you can install a ""30 Minutes or Less"" theme.JUDGMENT CALL:Plenty of action and improvised humor, ""30 Minutes or Less"" is an entertaining popcorn comedy/action film!One would wonder where Jesse Eisenberg's career would go after the success of ""The Social Network"", as some actors would tend to focus on deeper films.  But I suppose you can say that Eisenberg has been an actor that has taken up roles where the protagonist is seen as awkward such as his role in ""Adventureland"" and ""Zombieland"".  But with ""30 Minutes or Less"", it's interesting to see him play a pizza delivery guy that has a bomb attached to him.In some ways, partnering Eisenberg with the fun and hilarious Anziz Ansari is rather intriguing as well.  Prior to watching the film, I was thinking..was this going to be another ""Harold & Kumar"" type of stoner comedy or was it going to be a something along the lines of a ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" type of film.  One thing I knew is that with Anziz Ansari and Nick Swardson being part of the film, there was going to be some interesting improvisational, crazy scenes.I enjoyed ""30 Minutes or Less"" in the fact that it was straightforward comedy/action.  One of those films that you don't take seriously, you just sit down and enjoy!  And see where the characters will take you, as they try to steal $100,000 and also try to remove the bomb attach to Nick's body.  What ensues is a lot of crazy twists and one wonders if there will be a sequel to this film, because I get a feeling that we have not seen the last of characters Nick and Chet.The Blu-ray release of ""30 Minutes or Less"" comes with a good amount of special features, a hilarious commentary and also insight on the improvisational scenes.  And keeping with the consistency of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, picture quality was fantastic and the lossless soundtrack was quite appropriate for this comedy/action film.  While not overly immersive, there are good moments of surround sound use during the more action-driven scenes.Overall, if you are looking for a comedy/action film that you just want to sit back and enjoy and not take too seriously, then ""30 Minutes or Less"" is a film for you!",3,Blu-ray: Plenty of action and improvised humor...,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,5239,"['producer', 'Ben', 'Stiller',

Darsow,"[0, 1]",This movie deserves a 5/5 ratings because It has a funny pizza delivery guy and two weird/funny guys.It always makes me laugh and has a great story line. Almost every scene is funny.The movie character Is a guy name Nick Davis. He's a pizza delivery guy who gets held hostage because he has to rob a bank. The guys that strapped a bomb on his chest are two weird guys who wants to gets rich and they had a plan to get rich. Nick later tell his friend who's a teacher and that he has a bomb on his chest and he only has 10 hours to rob a bank or he's going to blow up.There are a lot of funny scenes in the movie but my favorite was when Nick and his friend just robbed the bank and a black cop comes up with his car and told them to drop their weapons. They both did. But then Nick unzipped his jacket and shows the cop the bomb and the cop ran faster than ever. It is my favorite part of the whole movie.  It always makes me laugh every time I watch that part.The thing I dislike about the movie is that there's a confusing part in the movie. And the movie should  be longer. It is only 1 hour and 45 long.You should buy this movie if you want to laugh and have a good time.

It is also directed by the talented Ruben Fleischer. One thing great about the movie is the acting. All of the actors have great chemistry. A lot of people complained and said that the characters are not like real people. Well, I guess it's true, but they're not completley fake. Like the character Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) seems real, and is someone I can relate to. Chet (Aziz Ansari) isn't exrtremeley realistic, but feels like someone who has the same reactions to the situation as any normal person would. And lastly, Nick Swardson and Danny McBride's charters are hilarious. You can tell they both have a great chemistry working with eachother. It's so fun watching them pull improv off of eachother. And Michael Pena, who plays the character Chango. He was suprisingly hilarious too. Other than the cast, the action scenes were fun. One is the beginning, and the other is the car chase scene. You can tell Ruben Fleischer dircted it, because of the almost slow-motion, similiar to Zombieland. This Bluray is great too. It has a nice video and audio quality.

The natural choice is to link up with a bonehead friend named Travis (Nick Swardson) to make a bomb, kidnap a pizza delivery guy named Nick (Jesse Eisenberg), make Nick rob a bank, and use the money from the bank heist to hire a hitman (horribly out of place Michael Pena).  If it sounds like a little bit too much to squeeze together into a coherent plot that has a semblance of believability, I agree.  And that's not even considering the hitman's intricate side story, flamethrowers, an Indian best friend inexplicably named Chet (Aziz Ansari), and the dreaded, unnecessary romantic angle that seemingly gets shoe-horned into every movie for absolutely no redeemable reason (well, getting Dilshad Vadsaria some screen time is the only redeemable reason).There are several laughs, and fans of McBride will like the movie more than most.  He absolutely steals the movie from the intended ""star"" Eisenberg, who does his best to distance himself from Zombieland.  The distance is not enough, and Rule #1 needs to be revisited.  He is neither believable or worth rooting for - unlike Zombieland.  He plays Eisenberg.  It's interesting to note, however, that McBride plays a stereotypical McBride character and comes off brilliantly.It's nothing that will blow your socks off, but it's not the worst thing I've ever seen.

1373695,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003Y5H5C4,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[16, 17]","30 Minutes or Less is a slacker comedy from Ruben Fleischer, the director ofZombieland, that runs only 53 minutes more than its title suggests. The story of a pizza delivery boy who is forced to rob a bank by two thugs who strap a bomb to him, much has been made about how the film bears a remarkable similarity to a real-life, more tragic story from a few years ago. The creators have vehemently denied this story served as inspiration and while the true story may have provided the kernel of an idea for the screenwriters, the rest is taken in a substantially different, some may argue disrespectful, direction.Jesse Eisenberg, fresh off his Oscar-nomination for The Social Network, plays Nick, a 20-something pizza boy who spends his days smoking pot and failing to deliver pizzas in the ""30 minutes or less"" timeframe the pizza chain promises. He has only one friend, Chet (Aziz Ansari), a substitute teacher, but the two have a falling out over various admissions, including Nick's relationship with Chet's sister Katie (Dilshad Vadsaria). Meanwhile, two losers named Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson) live under the shadow of Dwayne's domineering, ex-military father The Major (Fred Ward), while making $10 an hour cleaning his pool. At a strip-club, Dwayne tells a stripper about his father winning the lottery and how he could stand to inherit a couple million dollars if The Major were to die. Promising Dwayne a permanent position in his lap, the stripper tells Dwayne that if he can come up with $100,000, she knows someone who can make his father disappear indefinitely. With their get-rich-quick scheme in place, Dwayne and Travis ambush Nick, strap a bomb to his chest, and give him 10 hours to rob a bank.The plot makes no apologies for how ridiculous it is, but is actually clever in the way it gives a rather stupid plan to really stupid characters. After all, Dwayne and Travis' plan to have Nick rob a bank and give them the money so they can get some money is rather redundant. This does however work well, as the Dwayne and Travis characters are completely witless. History has suggested that a film with such a short running time shows a lack of ideas on the part of the screenwriter. In this case, it works for the film rather than against it. 30 Minutes or Less is brief, but not a single scene seems unnecessary and the pacing is top-notch. This is a comedy that moves very quickly and is both very exciting and very funny without feeling too rushed. The actual robbery scene, one of the highlights, is laugh-out-loud funny and genuinely exciting as well. The bomb strapped to Nick provides the story with a sense of urgency too. The script will be dismissed as derivative due to the buddy-comedy, action-comedy elements that have been heavily used in other films but it's successful in the way it finds its footing very quickly and never becomes too dark, too serious, or too light-hearted. It's fast-moving and very consistent in the way it unfolds and how it keeps the humor fresh in a mostly un-funny situation. It actually ends well too, with an abrupt ending that is a Hollywood ending at heart but isn't a complete Hollywood cop-out. It does end abruptly and readings have revealed a much darker, effective ending in the original script, but it still succeeds by wisely avoiding the cheesy Hollywood need to wrap everything up nicely so audiences can leave feeling warm and fuzzy.Fleischer is an excellent director that can balance the different genre elements with finesse and style. Whether he's directing dialogue scenes or the obligatory (in this type of film) car chase sequence, it all works and comes together nicely. There are also some subtle elements in the way he establishes the characters through look and attire. What is Fleischer suggesting by having Dwayne and Travis, the film's dumbest characters, wear Metallica and Insane Clown Posse shirts? If he is suggesting something, I applaud him. The film moves with a constant energy, helped along by a cast that has energy in spades. Eisenberg handles comedy quite well and he makes his performance in The Social Network seem even more impressive by comparison. His character Nick mentioning Facebook is an amusing little aside by itself. Ansari is a bundle of comedic energy, yet keeps his amped-up acting from going completely over-the-top. McBride, whom I consider to be one of the funniest comedians around, doesn't venture far from the dim-witted, egotistical jerk character he's made his name playing, but McBride possesses a comedic delivery that is unmatched by his contemporaries and he's as effective and hilarious as ever. Everyone has met a guy like the characters McBride plays and he plays these types with a satirical gusto that is much more layered than its low-brow humor suggests. Michael Pe&ntilde;a is becoming the go-to-guy for comedic roles with over-the-top accents, but as a talented dramatic actor he makes each one different and, while over-the-top, it's never campy. His performance as the potential hitman Chongo is a highlight here. Even Nick Swardson, whom I never find particularly funny, is actually well-utilized here. There's a friendly, energetic chemistry between Eisenberg, Ansari, McBride, and Swardson that really drives the film. It's apparent that the actors involved had a good time making it, which translates well onscreen and makes the movie even more of a joy to watch. When actors can be seen clearly having fun with their work, this generally has a positive effect on the audience viewing the film. From the actor's demeanor and rapport, I'd guess this was about as fun to make as it was to watch.30 Minutes or Less is simple summer, Hollywood fun with a cast of talented comedic actors working within the confines of stronger-than-expected material. It hasn't been received too well, but comedy is the most subjective genre of film and film critics don't exactly fall into this film's demographic. It's fun and energetic, with non-stop humor that will be enjoyed by the average moviegoer and anyone who has liked the previous work of the principal cast. How one can pan a film so highly enjoyable is beyond me.GRADE: B+",4,"Imperfect, But Highly Enjoyable Comedy With An Energetic Cast",1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,6179,"['30', 'Minutes', 'Less',

What they advertised is exactly what they delivered. And you can't help yourself from laughing. I tried, I really tried. Not quite full-on belly laughs, but enough to make the time fly.These guys are stunning morons - and I don't mean the characters. I mean these people, these actors, are real-life dolts. There's a reason why some performers routinely find themselves in certain roles, because producers can see that they're naturals who fit the script. No skill required.Notice - I did not say 'no talent'. That's because some guys are naturally talented, like Michael Jordan. Basketball was his thing, baseball wasn't; he was a natural on the hardcourt but sucked on the diamond. Some actors can do one kind of role with skill and flourish and not others, it happens. Can you honestly see Aaron Eisenberg as a Navy SEAL in anything other than a farcical satire? It's not a knock against the young actor, but some artists have a wide demonstrable skillset, others don't.Eisenberg, Ansari, McBride and Swardson are natural idiots - it's the movie equivalent of tossing fish into water. No insult, just honest observation. And again, they're funny. :-DI'd also be remiss not to mention a pair of my favorite character actors: Fred Ward and the always enjoyable Michael P&eacute;na, who never ceases to amaze me with his ability to transform himself into an ever growing list of character types.Loved the old school props to Detroit. Hearing Glenn Fry doing 'The Heat Is On', cops chasing cars, guys making crazy moves - loved it. Only wish they had gotten Eddie Murphy & Paul Reiser in a cameo - that would've bleeping rocked! I would've given it a full star bump for that alone.Had decent fun watching these demented bleepers run around having a good time with their one-page script. It worked for the Marx Brothers - I say run with it and have a blast. No pun intended. &lt;g>Again, a fun rental, but not for the kiddies. When a flick opens with a fellatio scene, you can pretty much write off any idea of family night at the movies. :-DOne final note: I'd actually like to see these exact same actors get together for another movie. It's an old school technique, gathering the same group of actors only switching around roles - Eisenberg and Ansari as the bad guys, McBride and Swanson as their victims. Or just mix them up completely - three bad guys and a single good guy, or heck, all bad guys.

When a movie is this bad it's hard to find that much to say about it and the plot is so simple that it should take just a paragraph or two.Jesse Eisenberg stars as Nick, a pizza delivery boy who uses every trick in the book to get there in time but doesn't always accomplish his task. Aziz Ansari is his room mate and best friend, a teacher who is moving out soon. So much for the set up on that end.Danny McBride is Dwayne, the belittled son of tough as nails rich man Fred Ward. Dwayne wants everything handed to him without work and has big plans that rarely work out. Nick Swarsdon is his sidekick Travis. Together they come up with a plot to get wealthy by robbing a bank without actually being the ones to rob it. They call for a pizza delivery (Nick), knock him unconscious and then strap a bomb to him. When he wakes they tell him he has a limited time to rob the bank and get to a point where they will disable the bomb and take the money.Nick seeks the help of his friend, talks to his friend's sister that he's been dating and does everything he can to get out of this mess. The pair do go through with the robbery but attempt to change the way it plays out before meeting to give up the cash.When I saw the trailer for this I thought it had possibilities. Too bad the best moments were all found in that trailer. Once again we have a group of characters we could care less about. It must be the new trend in Hollywood.Worst of all to me was McBride. The first few things I saw him in I thought he had potential. Now it seems that each role he takes requires him to talk as vulgar as he can, act nasty as possible and think its all funny.

1373702,A3HBE3VAKQ7RYF,B003Y5H5C4,"Megan @ Book Brats ""Book Brats Reviews""","[0, 0]","30 MINUTES OR LESS is the story of a slacker pizza delivery guy named Nick (Jesse Eisenberg), his best friend Chet (an elementary school teacher played by Aziz Ansari), and two buffoons (Danny McBride and Nick Swardson) who are plotting a murder in order to collect an inheritance. Nick is captured and wired with a bomb before being given 10 hours to rob a bank and turn over $100,000 dollars in order to save his life. Almost mirroring the story of real-life pizza delivery bank robber bomb victim Brian Wells, the movie is a mixed bag of laughs and duds.This is a movie that people will either enjoy or hate. I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed it when I came out of the theater. It's definite crude and lewd, with jokes sometimes racially motivated for example and some nudity. From the director of Zombieland, the visuals follow much the same path as Fleischer's previous effort, but what failed him was a poor script. The actors make up for a lot of that, giving their performances the gusto needed. McBride especially put forth a great performance as a misfit son who is tired of his father. For a story chock full of stupid characters, there are some great performances from these actors playing total idiots, from the bumbling would-be crooks to the pizza delivery boy who has trouble keeping up his boss' 30 minutes or less promise.One acting letdown for me, though, was Aziz Ansari. I love him as Tom Haverford in the amazing Parks and Recreation, but in this movie I couldn't find him believable in his role. There was something off to me, but his chemistry with the other actors makes up for this slight lapse.Fleischer definitely has the directing gift when it comes to these type of movies. Excellent car chases, a great eye for style, and amazing at pulling interesting, energetic performances from his cast. While it isn't as good as the amazing Zombieland, 30 Minutes or Less, is still a solid movie that fans of crude humor will enjoy. It's a definite summer movie that will appeal to teenage boys and young men, but even some girls could find this movie and its crude humor to be appealing.3.5/5",4,"Good effort by great cast, but writing was iffy",1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,2127,"['30', 'MINUTES', 'OR', 'LESS', 'story', 'slacker', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'guy', 'named', 'Nick', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'best', 'friend', 'Chet', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'played', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'two', 'buffoons', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'who', 'are', 'plotting', 'murder', 'order', 'collect', 'inheritance', 'Nick', 'captured', 'wired', 'bomb', 'being', 'given', '10', 'hours', 'rob', 'bank', 'turn', '100,000', 'dollars', 'order', 'save', 'life', 'Almost', 'mirroring', 'story', 'real-life', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'bank', 'robber', 'bomb', 'victim', 'Brian', 'Wells', 'movie', 'mixed', 'bag', 'laughs', 'duds.This', 'movie', 'people', 'will', 'either', 'enjoy', 'hate', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theater', 'definite', 'crude', 'lewd', 'jokes', 'sometimes', 'racially', 'motivated', 'example', 'nudity', 'director', 'Zombieland', 'visuals', 'follow', 'much', 'same', 'path', 'Fleischer', 'previous', 'effort', 'what', 'failed', 'was', 'poor', 'script', 'actors', 'make', 'up', 'lot', 'giving', 'performances', 'gusto', 'needed', 'McBride', 'especially', 'put', 'forth', 'great', 'performance', 'misfit', 'son', 'who', 'tired', 'father', 'story', 'chock', 'full', 'stupid', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'actors', 'playing', 'total', 'idiots', 'bumbling', 'would-be', 'crooks', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'boy', 'who', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'up', 'boss', '30', 'minutes', 'less', 'promise.One', 'acting', 'letdown', 'though', 'was', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'love', 'Tom', 'Haverford', 'amazing', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'believable', 'role', 'was', 'something', 'chemistry', 'other', 'actors', 'up', 'slight', 'lapse.Fleischer', 'definitely', 'directing', 'gift', 'when', 'type', 'movies', 'Excellent', 'car', 'chases', 'great', 'eye', 'style', 'amazing', 'pulling', 'interesting', 'energetic', 'performances', 'cast', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'amazing', 'Zombieland', '30', 'Minutes', 'Less', 'still', 'solid', 'movie', 'fans', 'crude', 'humor', 'will', 'enjoy', 'definite', 'summer', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'teenage', 'boys', 'young', 'men', 'even', 'girls', 'could', 'find', 'movie', 'crude', 'humor', 'be', 'appealing.3.5/5']",30 Minutes or Less

Here we have Jesse Eisenberg who made such a splash in last year's ""Social Network"" dumb back down to the kind of movies he was making before.  I suspect he was paid a bunch.  He plays Nick, a pizza delivery boy with a life going nowhere.  Nick, during a routine delivery is confronted by a couple dimwit minor league criminals who are intent on raising $100K to hire a hitman to kill one of their lottery rich fathers.  Rather than rob a bank themselves they strap a bomb-vest onto Nick and give him 10 hours to complete the task or they will remotely blow him up.These 2 idiots are played by Danny McBride and Nick Swardson and the idea that a.) they would come up with the idea itself and b.) they could build the bomb is in itself ridiculous.  These guys are lucky to find the bathroom.  Nick and his best friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) aren't much smarter.  ""30 Minutes"" has some funny stuff, little of which is the beyond the oh-so-common ""f-bomb"" vocabulary.  Most of the humor is supplied by Ansari who does a lot with what he is given.  One of the funnier side stories is that Nick has a thing for Chet's twin sister Kate (lovely Dilshad Vadsaria).  Nick confesses to Chet that he had a one night stand with her several years earlier and hasn't gotten over her.  This leads to an off and on again reconciliation that plays throughout the rest of the movie.

If you dont appreciate the simplicity of old high school style burns and such, this may not be for you. I thought it was pretty funny, but it wasnt the greatest film by any stretch. Danny McBride is one of the featured actors, and this movie has his fingerprints all over it. So...crass sexual jokes, silly one upsmanship, and a whole lot of idiocy mark this as his standard stock in trade.The basic premise is that McBrides dad (Fred Ward) is a millionaire due to a lucky lotto ticket. McBride and his buddy (Nick Swardson) are basically doing nothing with their lives except blowing up stuff and talking about their great plans for life. His dad wont share the wealth of course, so McBride ends up deciding to hire a hitman to kill his father. Only problem...he needs $100,000 to do so.So...he concocts a genius plan to trick or coerce somebody into getting the money for him. That somebody is a pizza delivery guy (Eisenberg). Eisenberg is actually the main star of the film along with his friend (Ansari), and the movie follows them as they try to get the money and then deliver it before....Anyway, none of the above are spoilers having been part of their advertising for the movie.

Awakening with a bomb strapped to his chest, Nick is told he has ten hours to rob a bank and bring back $100,000 or Dwayne will detonate the bomb.At a mere 83 minutes, the movie flies by at a frenetic pace.  Director Ruben Fleischer (""Zombieland"") is adept at crafting comic action sequences.  Aziz Ansari as Chet -- Nick's former best friend who tries to help him out of a tough predicament -- steals the show with his wide-eyed expressions, manic behavior, and hysterical babbling.  Eisenberg plays a variation of his likable nerd but seems a bit adrift and never fully inhabits his character.There is a sense of ad-libbing throughout that comes off flat, unfunny, and desperate, suggesting director Fleischer didn't have a lot of faith in the script.

Eisenberg shows off why he's an Oscar-worthy professional while his character's pal Chet (Aziz Ansari), often spews out dialogue loudly without the accompanying emotion, his eyes almost always bugging out of his face like a bulldog. In every scene, he saps whatever chemistry there might be by sounding like he's trying to land a part as a voice in an animated film. Where's the director here? In a strip joint scene, a girl (about a 6 on a scale of 0 to 10) strips off her top to reveal an unimpressive chest without any of the sensual moves one expects in a good lap dance,  - which is meant to dazzle the male character into deciding to kill his own father for the sensual delights of monetary inheritance - but you wonder how mediocre does everything have to be in this movie? You wonder if the director has ever been to a strip joint or is Gay? Maybe they should have brought in a heterosexual to explain to him that strippers giving lap dances are supposed to appear sexy, tantalizing and sensual.

1373723,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B003Y5H5C4,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","I hate this cast of actors more than I have ever hated the entire cast of a movie in my life. Danny McBride and Aziz Ansari are two of my least favorite actors in Hollywood, so why would I watch this movie? The trailer looked hilarious and that's really the point of trailers isn't it, to get you to watch a film you wouldn't otherwise be interested in. The story follows Dwayne, a spoiled rich kid who won't grow up. Dwayne and his buddy Travis hatch a drunken plan, to off Dwayne's father for the insurance money, using a pizza boy as a pawn in a murder for hire scheme. The pizza boys job is simple, rob a bank or the bomb they've strapped to his chest explodes. The clock is running out for pizza boy Nick, along with his best friend Chet, they have to come up with a plan before they're blown to bits. With this cast and the same Writer/Director as Zombieland, I was expecting all the funny parts to be in the trailer, but I was pleasantly surprised. That Facebook kid, Jesse Eisenberg stars and is actually pretty funny, he always reminds me of Michael Cera, only less lanky and gay. His Co-star is Danny McBride, who is my top 10 list of least favorite actors. It's not that he's a bad actor, but he's just so over the top with everything he does, that it destroys anything that could have been funny. Surprisingly, McBride is pretty toned down in this film and for once you could actually see that he can be very funny in the right circumstances. The story wasn't bad, but it isn't as unique as you might think. About 20 years ago this actually happened and in that case the pizza boy was killed, so turning it into a comedy may not have been the most sensitive thing to do. As for the film, it was a lot funnier than I was expecting and the cast actually had some really good chemistry. It's not the funniest film you'll ever see, but it's certainly a good way to kill a couple of hours.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,1896,"['hate', 'cast', 'actors', 'more', 'have', 'ever', 'hated', 'entire', 'cast', 'movie', 'life', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'are', 'two', 'least', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'trailer', 'looked', 'hilarious', 'really', 'point', 'trailers', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'otherwise', 'be', 'interested', 'story', 'Dwayne', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'kid', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'Dwayne', 'buddy', 'Travis', 'hatch', 'drunken', 'plan', 'off', 'Dwayne', 'father', 'insurance', 'money', 'using', 'pizza', 'boy', 'pawn', 'murder', 'hire', 'scheme', 'pizza', 'boys', 'job', 'simple', 'rob', 'bank', 'bomb', ""'ve"", 'strapped', 'chest', 'explodes', 'clock', 'running', 'out', 'pizza', 'boy', 'Nick', 'best', 'friend', 'Chet', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'plan', ""'re"", 'blown', 'bits', 'cast', 'same', 'Writer/Director', 'Zombieland', 'was', 'expecting', 'funny', 'parts', 'be', 'trailer', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Facebook', 'kid', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'stars', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'always', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'only', 'less', 'lanky', 'gay', 'Co-star', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'who', 'top', '10', 'list', 'least', 'favorite', 'actors', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'just', 'so', 'top', 'everything', 'anything', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'Surprisingly', 'McBride', 'pretty', 'toned', 'down', 'film', 'once', 'could', 'actually', 'see', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'right', 'circumstances', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'as', 'unique', 'might', 'think', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'actually', 'happened', 'case', 'pizza', 'boy', 'was', 'killed', 'turning', 'comedy', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'sensitive', 'thing', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'lot', 'funnier', 'was', 'expecting', 'cast', 'actually', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'chemistry', 'not', 'funniest', 'film', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'certainly', 'good', 'way', 'kill', 'couple', 'hours']",30 Minutes or Less

Dwayne (McBride) and Nick (Eisenberg) have different lives but they both feel the same way about them. Dwayne is sitting around waiting for his dad to die so he can get the inheritance money. When a stripper tells him she can find a guy to kill him, his life changes. Rather then getting his hands dirty he forces pizza delivery driver Nick to do it for him, by putting a bomb on his chest. Contrary to what the plot of the film is, this is very, very funny. The combination of two clueless people forcing two clueless kids to rob a bank is hilarious and very fun to watch. Eisenberg is back in ""Zombieland"" form, and McBride is the funniest he has ever been. The supporting cast adds a lot to the movie, and there really isn't a dull moment in this movie. Most comedies lately try to add to much heart (where it doesn't need it) and it takes away from the laughs. This one plays more like a ""Seinfeld"" type, where everyone is mean and rude to everyone else, and that is what makes it so much fun. It doesn't try to be something it's not. Overall, the rare type of recent comedy that makes you laugh all the way through. I give it an A-.*Also try - Your Highness & Zombieland",4,A very very funny comedy that doesn't try to be what it's not. Funny all the way through. Watch & laugh.

What do you do? That question is put to Jessie Eisenberg in this film as he portrays a pizza delivery man who is certainly unhappy but far too much of a slacker to make any serious effort to change his circumstances.Nick (Eisenberg) runs to his closest friend for help. Of course they have just had a falling out and Chet, a teacher, (played by stand-up comedian Aziz Ansari) is very surprised to see him. Even more so when he sees the explosive device and realizes his friend just brought a bomb to a school full of innocent children. Soon Chet agrees to help and the robbery becomes inevitable.There has been a small degree of criticism for making a comedy film about circumstances which are eerily similar to those of another pizza delivery man in Pennsylvania. Of course, the man in that case was not an unwitting accomplice but was in fact in league with the robbers and simply believed the bomb was not real. Oddly enough, an episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent bares an even more similar storyline and predates the Pennsylvania case and an episode of Bones that also contains a plot with many similar elements came and went with no such outrage.That said, the film is a comedy and achieves it's objectives with relative ease. Eisenberg is seen here with his usual mannerisms but without the intelligence he's previously displayed in films such as The Social Network and Adventureland. Aziz Ansari is passable as the best friend and the would-be killers, played by comedian/actors Danny McBride and Nick Swardson are funny, though not particularly frightening without explosives. All in all, it's a solid comedy, a good time, and not much else.",4,"Fun, not amazing",1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,1810,"['Someone', 'bomb', 'chest', 'tells', 'do', ""n't"", 'rob', 'back', 'return', 'least', '100,000', 'will', 'detonate', 'bomb', 'kill', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'question', 'put', 'Jessie', 'Eisenberg', 'film', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'man', 'who', 'certainly', 'unhappy', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'slacker', 'make', 'serious', 'effort', 'change', 'circumstances.Nick', 'Eisenberg', 'closest', 'friend', 'help', 'course', 'have', 'just', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'Chet', 'teacher', 'played', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'very', 'surprised', 'see', 'Even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'explosive', 'device', 'realizes', 'friend', 'just', 'brought', 'bomb', 'school', 'full', 'innocent', 'children', 'Soon', 'Chet', 'help', 'robbery', 'inevitable.There', 'been', 'small', 'degree', 'criticism', 'making', 'comedy', 'film', 'circumstances', 'are', 'eerily', 'similar', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'man', 'Pennsylvania', 'course', 'man', 'case', 'was', 'not', 'unwitting', 'accomplice', 'was', 'fact', 'league', 'robbers', 'simply', 'believed', 'bomb', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'even', 'more', 'similar', 'storyline', 'Pennsylvania', 'case', 'episode', 'Bones', 'also', 'plot', 'many', 'similar', 'elements', 'came', 'went', 'such', 'outrage.That', 'said', 'film', 'comedy', 'objectives', 'relative', 'ease', 'Eisenberg', 'seen', 'here', 'usual', 'mannerisms', 'intelligence', 'previously', 'displayed', 'films', 'such', 'Social', 'Network', 'Adventureland', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'passable', 'best', 'friend', 'would-be', 'killers', 'played', 'comedian/actors', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'are', 'funny', 'not', 'particularly', 'frightening', 'explosives', 'solid', 'comedy', 'good', 'time', 'not', 'much', 'else']",30 Minutes or Less

OK, make a bomb, strap it to a pizza delivery driver Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) and makes him rob a bank.The story of ""30: Minutes or Less"" starts off pretty well, but for all the talented cast involved (with Aziz Ansari as Chet, Nick's best friend), the film soon loses momentum, not knowing what it really wants to do. Even at 83 minutes (with a post-credit scene) the action/thriller/comedy feels very long.""30: Minutes or Less"" stars Jesse Eisenberg and is directed by Ruben Fleischer. They are also the star and the director of a more effective comedy ""Zombieland."" Eisenberg, whose character in ""Zombieland"" was much more interesting, does his best here, but in the end most scenes are stolen by Danny McBride and Nick Swardson in ""30: Minutes or Less.""That leaves the viewer with no one to root for.
