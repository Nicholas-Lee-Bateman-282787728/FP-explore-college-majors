1460654,A4WEZJOIZIV4U,B005GYSUYI,"Chuck Bittner ""Disabled comedian & gamer!""","[1, 1]",To me Band of Brothers and The Pacific are some of the greatest things that Hollywood has ever produced. Band of Brothers is a look at wars effect on groups of men wears to me the Pacific is more about war's effect on the individual. I try watch these movies (I call them movies because they're like 10 hour movies in my opinion) every year as a makes me appreciate what so many soldiers have given up and sacrificed in my behalf.At the time of writing this review this could be had for under $70 and it's actually more expensive to buy the set individually.

1460655,A3PW9HG9RVKALU,B005GYSUYI,David Johnson,"[15, 16]","First of all: I waited to get both Band of Brothers and the Pacific together and this box set was perfect for me. It was only slightly more expensive than buying each series individually but the box is of great quality and the blu rays look great as well. I haven't seen the exclusive documentary yet but I plan to soon.I had seen Band of Brothers many times over the years but never the Pacific for some reason. After enjoying Band of Brothers for the 10th time when I got this box set, I watched the Pacific. I think part of the appeal of Band of Brothers is that you can watch it many, many times and it gets better everytime. You start to relate with the characters and understand their plights. When you watch something for the first time, it's kinda hard to remember who is who under their helmets or why you should care. That's how I felt during the Pacific. Only watched it once but I found it hard to care like I did with Band of Brothers. Now that being said, there is no doubt in my mind that I will watch it again and there is also no doubt that it will grow on me further.Both series are absolutely incredible. What I said above about the Pacific was just a nitpicking personal experience. Taken alone, each EPISODE could be it's own movie. The production qualities are fantastic and the action is amazing. Much better than many movies today.And the blu rays quality and sound is astronomical. I would often turn to my girlfriend and go ""Look at the detail on the jacket!!!"" or ""SURROUND SOUND!!"" when bullits were flying through the rear speakers on Pelilieu in the Pacific.Great box set.

1460668,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005GYSUYI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[122, 125]","With a history aficionado (in general) and a World War II buff (in particular) on my holiday shopping list, I always face the inevitable crisis about what to get them. Arguably, HBO's 2001 miniseries ""Band of Brothers"" and the 2010 offering ""The Pacific"" are two of the most significant narrative works to emerge on the contemporary entertainment scene. Spearheaded by the powerhouse collective of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, these two massive enterprises showcase different aspects of the Great War. While initially dubious of the hefty price tag (although I picked one up when Amazon had it deeply discounted), there is no denying that the appearance of the Special Edition Gift Set is both handsome and deluxe. As a gift or if you don't already own the two shows, this would be an easy recommendation. However, if you do have one or both of the programs--I'm not sure that this qualifies as a necessary upgrade.I will make some comments about the programs for newbies in a moment, but let's get down to the facts for those who are already familiar with the two miniseries and just want to know about this specific item.Packaging: The DVD discs are placed within a large hardbound book with thick cardboard pages on which glossy photographs accompany the inserts. It's akin to having a coffee table book with DVDs inside. There are two discs housed on each two page spread (one side only) and I have no issues with too much glue or scratched discs which can be problematic in similar sets. It's really quite a nice layout. The book itself is then housed in a the simple box pictured which seals magnetically. Granted, the size of the overall package may not sit easily with your traditional DVD collection--but it is designed as a real centerpiece.DVDs: The two actual miniseries, with all previously released bonus material, are carried over from the prior individual releases. Each disc houses two episodes (both Band of Brothers and The Pacific run ten episodes or five discs). Each miniseries then has a Bonus disc. As I said, these features are the same as those previously released. This makes up 12 DVDs and a thirteenth has a new documentary feature.Principle bonus features carried over for Band of Brothers:""We Stand Alone Together"" DocumentaryRon Livingston's Video Diary""Making of"" FeaturetteNormandy Premiere FeaturettePrinciple Bonus Features carried over for The Pacific:""Profiles of the Pacific"" featurette""Making the Pacific"" featurette""Anatomy of the Pacific War"" featuretteOn Blu-ray only: An Enhanced Viewing Mode ExperienceNew Documentary: ""He Has Seen War."" This is a 53 minute feature that follows some of the veterans shown in both miniseries home as they reminisce about those homecoming experiences. It is bleak, sometimes painful, and a very emotional addition. It is very worthy to be seen--but if you already own both shows, it's not enough to drive a double dip purchase.""Band of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"" represent very different components of the war. I won't synopsize either show as that information is widely available (and I've gone on way too long). Both are essential viewing in my opinion. Packaging them together makes a beautiful set.

Band of Brothers is probably one of the greatest documentaries/films/shorts/whatever you want to call it that I have ever seen.  I wish that my schools would have taught me some of this stuff growing up because I would have found class a whole lot more interesting.  The hell that these guys in Band of Brothers and the Pacific is just mind numbing, and as I have always felt, we should be treating out Vets with a whole lot more respect than they get.  These are the heroes of America and who keep us going and who have built us up, and they deserve A LOT more.The quality of these movies are fantastic, as they are Blu Ray, and the sound quality is perfect as well.  The packaging is pretty cool too as the inlays on each page are on very sturdy material and the pictures included on each in lay are perfectly clear and just fantastic.  I wish I would have watched these years ago, and have not seen them until I bought this recently, and I loved Band of Brothers with the utmost love.  I would give Band of Brothers a 10/10, but I would give the Pacific a 6/10.  It was just an alright series, but maybe it was just because Band of Brothers was so incredibly amazing, that anything after will only be sub par.
