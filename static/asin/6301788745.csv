But for the most part this is a loud, cliched, predictable idiotic film that is a total waste of a lot of talented actors. Dan Aykroyd (who can be very funny) does such annyoing and just plain terrible impersonations of famous people. The rest of the film just resorts to cheap stereotypes about different ethnic groups.

266066,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301788745,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","I passed on this one when it was in the theatres because of the terrible marketing campaign for it.  They emphasized all the worst aspects of the film and packaged it in one clip i.e. Dan Aykroyd's character going bonkers.  The critics and audiences alike must have agreed because they dropped this one like a bad penny.  Time has been kind to ""Loose Cannons"" either because you can watch it divorced from it's awful promotion or the world has been made safe for mentally challenged detectives thanks to Adrian Monk.  The film's central plot is so so but  the characterizations are just great.  Dan Aykroyd gives a bravura performance as a schizophrenic criminologist.  Aykroyd gives real nuance to his work here going out on a tightrope but never quite going over the edge.  I detected real sensitivity in his handling of this tricky role and that's not easy to do.  Gene Hackman does what he does best and that's be Gene Hackman.  There's a real rapport between he and Aykroyd's character that's palpable.  My favorite scene in the movie is one where Hackman sleeps over at Aykroyd's sanitized apartment in a separate room.  The look on Hackman's face as Aykroyd has night terrors is priceless.  Aside from the principals Dom DeLuise gives a nice turn as a likable porn king and Nancy Travis(Nancy Travis!!!!) is on hand for the eye candy.

Yes, the plot is somewhat cliched--Nazis are the bad guys who must be stopped and the good local cops battle the bureaucrats at the FBI.  But Dan Ackroyd, Gene Hackman, and Dom de Luise make it worth watching. Ackroyd is terrific as the brilliant but mentally disturbed detective, Hackman as the straight shooter, and De Luise as the sleazy but good hearted target ofthe bad guys.

He's called to a crime scene at a boat dock where he finds Akroid explaining exactly what happened given his analysis of the evidence. Hackman, to say the least, doesn't have much use for whiz-bang theories on crimes, but he reluctantly teams with Akroid to find one of the victims (Dom DeLuise) that got away -- the one the bad guys are after. Turns out the bad guys in question are Germans seeking to protect their candidate for Chancellor (or something) who has a Nazi past and DeLuise knows where the film proving that past is. Anyway, Akroid has one signficant problem: while he's a brilliant analyst, he's got multiple personalities that come out at, well, the most unsuspecting times.So, after finding DeLuise, Hackman and Akroid go to one bizarre scene after another and find themselves the targets of the bad guys. One scene has Akroid driving Hackman's car and destroying all the possessions on it and in it. Another has Akroid's personality becoming a cartoon character to get out of a jam.The plot isn't very plausable, but it isn't outlandish and for this sort of movie, all that is OK. Both Hackman and Akroid are brilliant in their roles and both are very funny at times. I don't recall any or much in the way of language, but there is some mild violence. It isn't too bad and this can be a fun movie for the family to watch.",5,Certainly worth viewing as its funny and entertaining,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,1547,"['movie', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'win', 'Oscars', 'even', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'voting', 'was', 'fun', 'movie.Hackman', 'cop', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'move', 'possessions', 'station', 'wagon', 'called', 'crime', 'scene', 'boat', 'dock', 'where', 'Akroid', 'explaining', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'given', 'analysis', 'evidence', 'Hackman', 'say', 'least', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'use', 'whiz-bang', 'theories', 'crimes', 'reluctantly', 'Akroid', 'find', 'one', 'victims', 'Dom', 'DeLuise', 'got', 'away', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'question', 'are', 'Germans', 'seeking', 'protect', 'candidate', 'Chancellor', 'something', 'who', 'Nazi', 'past', 'DeLuise', 'where', 'film', 'proving', 'past', 'Anyway', 'Akroid', 'one', 'signficant', 'problem', 'brilliant', 'analyst', 'got', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'come', 'out', 'well', 'most', 'unsuspecting', 'times.So', 'finding', 'DeLuise', 'Hackman', 'Akroid', 'go', 'one', 'bizarre', 'scene', 'find', 'targets', 'bad', 'guys', 'One', 'scene', 'Akroid', 'driving', 'Hackman', 'car', 'destroying', 'possessions', 'Akroid', 'personality', 'becoming', 'cartoon', 'character', 'get', 'jam.The', 'plot', ""n't"", 'very', 'plausable', ""n't"", 'outlandish', 'sort', 'movie', 'OK', 'Hackman', 'Akroid', 'are', 'brilliant', 'roles', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'much', 'way', 'language', 'mild', 'violence', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'movie', 'family', 'watch']",N/A
