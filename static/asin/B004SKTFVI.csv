It was featured on the OLD Movie Macabre series, but this NEW Movie Macabre series' version is much better and funnier!The movie has some charm to it....it had me howling at the moon and licking my.......lips, at the sight of the beautiful Elvira, and she comes up with great jokes during the movie.Elvira For President!Now THAT is one campaign I'd love to get behind!Donald Trump? His hair should be the subject of a horror film...""The Hair That Wouldnt Move"".President Obama?  He promised change. He gave us the S.O.S.President Elvira? Oh, yeah, baby, I would gladly flip my lever in the voting booth on her behalf!Her ""twins"" would make Bush and Cheney look like Larry and Curly.Men everywhere would be saluting Elvira on Erec....um,I mean ELECTION Day!She would put the sense of humor back into America.These two movies, one with a Werewolf, one with a Vampire, will make you howl and bite with laughter and will quench your thirst for the macabre.Elvira spices up these movies and makes them fun..",5,Elvira gives these movies a rise!,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,1281,"['be', 'honest', 'satanic', 'rites', 'Dracula', 'pretty', 'much', 'sucks', '..and', 'dont', 'mean', 'vampire', 'kind', 'way.But', 'Elvira', 'unwatchable', 'watchable', 'experience', 'watching', 'movie', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'one.The', 'real', 'gem', 'here', 'Werewolf', 'Washington', 'was', 'featured', 'OLD', 'Movie', 'Macabre', 'series', 'NEW', 'Movie', 'Macabre', 'series', 'version', 'much', 'better', 'funnier', 'movie', 'charm', '.it', 'had', 'howling', 'moon', 'licking', '.lips', 'sight', 'beautiful', 'Elvira', 'up', 'great', 'jokes', 'movie.Elvira', 'President', 'Now', 'one', 'campaign', ""'d"", 'love', 'get', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'hair', 'should', 'be', 'subject', 'horror', 'film', 'Hair', 'Wouldnt', 'Move', '.President', 'Obama', 'promised', 'change', 'gave', 'S.O.S.President', 'Elvira', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'baby', 'would', 'gladly', 'flip', 'lever', 'voting', 'booth', 'behalf', 'twins', 'would', 'make', 'Bush', 'Cheney', 'look', 'Larry', 'Curly.Men', 'everywhere', 'would', 'be', 'saluting', 'Elvira', 'Erec', '.um', 'mean', 'ELECTION', 'Day', 'would', 'put', 'sense', 'humor', 'back', 'America.These', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'Werewolf', 'one', 'Vampire', 'will', 'make', 'howl', 'bite', 'laughter', 'will', 'quench', 'thirst', 'macabre.Elvira', 'up', 'movies', 'fun..']",Elvira's Movie Macabre: Satanic Rites of Dracula / The Werewolf of Washington
