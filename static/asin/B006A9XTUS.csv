1514148,A22RZG1NQ0WAUX,B006A9XTUS,Katrina L. Burchett,"[2, 2]","Regina Reynolds (Rolonda Watts) had expensive taste since she was a child, and as an adult her love of material things has caused trouble in her family. Can `a mother's love' help Regina to see what's really important in life?This is the first I've heard of Tim Alexander and Carolyn Alexander. A Mother's Love is a gospel stage play presented in the form of a film (I read that somewhere) and I really enjoyed it. The characters are believable, the story is interesting and funny at times, and the acting is good. There are quite a few important messages, but the one that stayed with me after watching the movie is how much damage can be caused when parents put their lives and careers before their children.My favorite character was Georgia (Amentha Dymally), a godly woman full of wisdom and love for her family. And my favorite scene was the one with stand-up comedian, actor and writer, Buddy Lewis (Love on Layaway, The Fabric of a Man). The situation that involved him wasn't something I'd laugh at in reality, but he made it so funny in this movie.I highly recommend this inspiring film!!",5,An Inspiring Film,1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,1097,"['Regina', 'Reynolds', 'Rolonda', 'Watts', 'had', 'expensive', 'taste', 'was', 'child', 'adult', 'love', 'material', 'things', 'caused', 'trouble', 'family', 'Can', 'mother', 'love', 'help', 'Regina', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'life', 'first', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Tim', 'Alexander', 'Carolyn', 'Alexander', 'A', 'Mother', 'Love', 'gospel', 'stage', 'play', 'presented', 'form', 'film', 'read', 'somewhere', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'story', 'interesting', 'funny', 'times', 'acting', 'good', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'important', 'messages', 'one', 'stayed', 'watching', 'movie', 'how', 'much', 'damage', 'can', 'be', 'caused', 'when', 'parents', 'put', 'lives', 'careers', 'children.My', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'Georgia', 'Amentha', 'Dymally', 'godly', 'woman', 'full', 'wisdom', 'love', 'family', 'favorite', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'actor', 'writer', 'Buddy', 'Lewis', 'Love', 'Layaway', 'Fabric', 'Man', 'situation', 'involved', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', ""'d"", 'laugh', 'reality', 'made', 'so', 'funny', 'movie.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'inspiring', 'film']",A Mother's Love
