600273,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JLFT,A Customer,"[2, 12]","Summary:ER is a fast-paced television show created by Michael Crichton to highlight life in hospital emergency rooms.  The first season of the episode introduces all of the characters and carries them through some of the initial plots, including the loss of Dr. Benton's (Eriq La Salle) mother and Nurse Hathaway's aborted marriage (Julianna Margulies).My Comments:The episode is pretty interesting to watch, but it grows old fast.  I'm sure the writers have tried their best to come up with new conditions and new situations in order for the staff to have to do different things, but because the audience really doesn't know what 99% of the disorders are, it probably doesn't matter.  All they see is someone come in on a gurney, get a lot of attention, see a lot of blood, and watch the doctors, residents, and nurses fight about everything.Which leads to the characters and the deeper running story lines.  After watching just a couple of episodes the viewer is inevitably going to have to look for something more than just the action of an emergency room to keep their attention.  The show tries to grab that attention by creating unique characters whose lives pretty much revolve around their time in the ER.  Of course there is also the periodic integration of outside lives with life inside the ER, but unless you have watched the show from the very beginning, sometimes its hard to know what is really going on with the characters.  This DVD does do a little to help with that by giving brief bios on each of the characters (not the actors), but I don't think the very brief bios really get to the heart of who these people are supposed to be.I do have to admit that the acting isn't terrible, but neither is it universally stellar.  Strangely I find myself more impressed by the male actors of the show (Noah Wyle - Dr. John Carter; Anthony Edwards - Dr. Mark Greene; George Clooney - Dr. Doug Ross; Eriq La Salle - Dr. Peter Benton) than with the female actors (Laura Innes - Dr. Kerry Weaver; Julianna Margulies - Nurse Carol Hathaway).  For the most part the male actors, though not absolute stand outs, are pretty good and fairly consistent.  The female actors, however, just seem to rub me the wrong way and aren't nearly as convincing.When the show originally came out I wasn't all that interested.  I was still in high school and had better things to do.  Occasionally I would watch a few minutes of an episode here or there if I could find nothing else to watch during my brief interludes with the electronic babysitter, but generally I would watch pretty much anything but ER.  From the episodes that I've seen I'm amazed that people that follow the show haven't shown higher rates of suicide than people watching sitcoms (maybe they have, someone should do a study).  The show is really rather depressing.  Nothing ever seems to go right, people die all of the time, and even the main characters periodically attempt suicide and are always upset with one another or about something.  I don't know how anyone can really stick to this show for this reason alone.So, what we have is a rather repetitive TV show with okay actors that tries to keep the viewers attention by developing underlying story lines for each of the characters but in order to understand the story lines you have to see every single episode.Assuming that you have followed the series, you will likely find this box set to be a great collection.  It has a lot of extras that are fairly well done, including a number of outtakes, interviews, and a lot of behind the scenes information.Overall, though I'm sure this series has been really interesting to some, unless you follow it closely I think the drama can quickly pass you by.  Initial exposure to ER can be pretty shocking, with all of the blood, gore, and sadness that accompanies the quite regular deaths, but once you've seen one person die from myocardio-something or other you've seen about all there is to see.  I'm sure die-hard fans of ER will love this box set.  But having never been sucked in by the depressing stories that anchor the show, I can't really say that I loved it.",3,"pretty good show, lots of extras",1062547200,"09 3, 2003",2003,4128,"['Summary', 'ER', 'fast-paced', 'television', 'show', 'created', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'highlight', 'life', 'hospital', 'emergency', 'rooms', 'first', 'season', 'episode', 'characters', 'initial', 'plots', 'including', 'loss', 'Dr.', 'Benton', 'Eriq', 'La', 'Salle', 'mother', 'Nurse', 'Hathaway', 'aborted', 'marriage', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', '.My', 'Comments', 'episode', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'watch', 'old', 'fast', ""'m"", 'sure', 'writers', 'have', 'tried', 'best', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'conditions', 'new', 'situations', 'order', 'staff', 'have', 'do', 'different', 'things', 'audience', 'really', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', '99', '%', 'disorders', 'are', 'probably', ""n't"", 'matter', 'see', 'someone', 'come', 'gurney', 'get', 'lot', 'attention', 'see', 'lot', 'blood', 'watch', 'doctors', 'residents', 'nurses', 'fight', 'everything.Which', 'leads', 'characters', 'deeper', 'running', 'story', 'lines', 'watching', 'just', 'couple', 'episodes', 'viewer', 'inevitably', 'going', 'have', 'look', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'action', 'emergency', 'room', 'keep', 'attention', 'show', 'grab', 'attention', 'creating', 'unique', 'characters', 'lives', 'pretty', 'much', 'revolve', 'time', 'ER', 'course', 'also', 'periodic', 'integration', 'outside', 'lives', 'life', 'ER', 'have', 'watched', 'show', 'very', 'beginning', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'characters', 'DVD', 'do', 'little', 'help', 'giving', 'brief', 'bios', 'characters', 'not', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'very', 'brief', 'bios', 'really', 'get', 'heart', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'supposed', 'be.I', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'acting', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'universally', 'stellar', 'Strangely', 'find', 'more', 'impressed', 'male', 'actors', 'show', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Carter', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Dr.', 'Mark', 'Greene', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Dr.', 'Doug', 'Ross', 'Eriq', 'La', 'Salle', 'Dr.', 'Peter', 'Benton', 'female', 'actors', 'Laura', 'Innes', 'Dr.', 'Kerry', 'Weaver', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'Nurse', 'Carol', 'Hathaway', 'most', 'part', 'male', 'actors', 'not', 'absolute', 'stand', 'outs', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'fairly', 'consistent', 'female', 'actors', 'however', 'just', 'seem', 'rub', 'wrong', 'way', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'convincing.When', 'show', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'was', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'had', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'Occasionally', 'would', 'watch', 'few', 'minutes', 'episode', 'here', 'there', 'could', 'find', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'brief', 'interludes', 'electronic', 'babysitter', 'generally', 'would', 'watch', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'ER', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'people', 'follow', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'shown', 'higher', 'rates', 'suicide', 'people', 'watching', 'sitcoms', 'maybe', 'have', 'someone', 'should', 'do', 'study', 'show', 'really', 'rather', 'depressing', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'go', 'right', 'people', 'die', 'time', 'even', 'main', 'characters', 'periodically', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'are', 'always', 'upset', 'one', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'really', 'stick', 'show', 'reason', 'alone.So', 'what', 'have', 'rather', 'repetitive', 'TV', 'show', 'okay', 'actors', 'keep', 'viewers', 'attention', 'developing', 'underlying', 'story', 'lines', 'characters', 'order', 'understand', 'story', 'lines', 'have', 'see', 'single', 'episode.Assuming', 'have', 'followed', 'series', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'box', 'set', 'be', 'great', 'collection', 'lot', 'extras', 'are', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'including', 'number', 'outtakes', 'interviews', 'lot', 'scenes', 'information.Overall', ""'m"", 'sure', 'series', 'been', 'really', 'interesting', 'follow', 'closely', 'think', 'drama', 'can', 'quickly', 'pass', 'Initial', 'exposure', 'ER', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'shocking', 'blood', 'gore', 'sadness', 'quite', 'regular', 'deaths', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'person', 'die', 'myocardio-something', 'other', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'see', ""'m"", 'sure', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'ER', 'will', 'love', 'box', 'set', 'having', 'never', 'been', 'sucked', 'depressing', 'stories', 'anchor', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'loved']",ER: Season 1

600277,A2H1QA1Z1TZI6S,B00005JLFT,"belvis ""i don't have one""","[17, 18]","In the history of television, first seasons are rarely that impressive. I mean, a lot of times you'll hear people saying how remarkable the first season was, but when you compare to later seasons, it will pale.  Such is not the case with ""ER.""  ""ER"" got off and running with an incredible first season any show would be lucky to compare to.It all started with a wonderful pilot.  Any other show would be lucky to have a pilot like the pilot of ""ER,"" as well.  Running two hours with commercials and an hour and a half withouht, it's simply spellbinding, launching off the series splendidly, introducing the characters and the style of the show that continues to this day.  The characters we meet in the pilot are:Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards): Mark is basically the head guy of the hospital, and in the pilot, we become familiar with his hectic lifestyle and how he juggles his work and his family, not always successfully.  He has an annoying little brat daughter and a terrible wife, but this doesn't stop him from being perhaps the best character of not just the original cast, but the entire series.  Anthony Edwards makes Mark such a loveable character.Doug Ross (George Clooney): This was the role that basically shot George Clooney off to superstardom, and he plays it well.  Doug is a tough but a irresponsible man and in the pilot we become familiar with his previous love affair with Nurse Carol Hathaway.Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield): By far my favorite character from the original cast, Dr. Lewis is a tough and wonderful character (not to mention freakishly sexy).  Sherry Stringfield really lights up this role.  Unfortunately, when she returned to the show after several years of absence, it just wasn't quite the same, but fortunately we have the first two and a half seasons to treasure her wonderful character and the wonderful acting that Sherry Stringfield gave us.John Carter (Noah Wyle): Carter is just a fresh faced, eager to learn young 20-something med student in the pilot, and he quickyl gets thrown into the exciting world of ER medicine and surgery when he has to deliver a baby just as the mother arrives through the hospital doors.Carol Hathaway (Jullianna Margullies): The thing you'll probably notice in the pilot is that Jullianna Margullies is listed as a guest star, and not put with the main cast.  The plan was to have her die in the first episode, but fortunately she got to stay for six wonderful seasons.  This character represents a lot about classic ""ER"" and it definately one of the most interesting people to work at County General.  In the pilot, we learn a whole lot about her character when she attempts suicide and is saved by her friends at the ER.  The following episodes revolve very much around her and her returning to a normal life.Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle): Benton is an arrogant little prick, but you have to love him.  It's funny to note that he does seem slightly different in the pilot, more eager and cheerful (not much, but whatever).  He gets some great moments in the first episode, but most noticeably when he performs an emergency surgery without assistance and ends up saving a life.This is the cast.  Although the show as it is now (in its twelfth season) has a nice enough cast, it's just not the same as the original six, who stand together as a true television ensemble.The first season is just wonderful.  The show rolls along smoothly, churning out storylines compelling, dramatic, heartbreaking, and often funny.  It's a perfect combination.  The first season also brings us plenty of classic episodes, including the famous ""Love's Labor Loss,"" which may have the saddest ending of any ""ER"" episode ever, as Dr. Greene cries quietly over the knowledge that he may have caused the death of a new mother.  The first season won multiple Emmys, and it deserved all of them and more.Warner Brothers did a real nice job with this DVD set.  The episodes are presented in widescreen, which has caused some controversy, since the first six seasons of the show were filmed and broadcast in fullscreen format, but the bottomline is that the episodes look great matted and it makes them match with later seasons nicely, so I have no complaints.  There are a decent amound of supplemental materials, among them a nice documementary about the pilot and the first season.""ER"" is one of the best shows ever made, no kidding.  Although I'm still a big fan of the ""ER"" currently on, it in now way compares with these incredible early seasons, and the first season is a prime example of ""ER"" at its finest.",5,One Of The Best Debut Seasons In Television History,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,4567,"['history', 'television', 'first', 'seasons', 'are', 'rarely', 'impressive', 'mean', 'lot', 'times', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'people', 'saying', 'how', 'remarkable', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'when', 'compare', 'later', 'seasons', 'will', 'pale', 'Such', 'not', 'case', 'ER', 'ER', 'got', 'off', 'running', 'incredible', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'lucky', 'compare', 'started', 'wonderful', 'pilot', 'other', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'lucky', 'have', 'pilot', 'pilot', 'ER', 'as', 'well', 'Running', 'two', 'hours', 'commercials', 'hour', 'half', 'withouht', 'simply', 'spellbinding', 'launching', 'off', 'series', 'splendidly', 'introducing', 'characters', 'style', 'show', 'day', 'characters', 'meet', 'pilot', 'are', 'Mark', 'Greene', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Mark', 'basically', 'head', 'guy', 'hospital', 'pilot', 'become', 'familiar', 'hectic', 'lifestyle', 'how', 'work', 'family', 'not', 'always', 'successfully', 'annoying', 'little', 'brat', 'daughter', 'terrible', 'wife', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'perhaps', 'best', 'character', 'not', 'just', 'original', 'cast', 'entire', 'series', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Mark', 'loveable', 'character.Doug', 'Ross', 'George', 'Clooney', 'was', 'role', 'basically', 'shot', 'George', 'Clooney', 'superstardom', 'well', 'Doug', 'tough', 'irresponsible', 'man', 'pilot', 'become', 'familiar', 'previous', 'love', 'affair', 'Nurse', 'Carol', 'Hathaway.Susan', 'Lewis', 'Sherry', 'Stringfield', 'far', 'favorite', 'character', 'original', 'cast', 'Dr.', 'Lewis', 'tough', 'wonderful', 'character', 'not', 'mention', 'freakishly', 'sexy', 'Sherry', 'Stringfield', 'really', 'up', 'role', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'returned', 'show', 'several', 'years', 'absence', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same', 'fortunately', 'have', 'first', 'two', 'half', 'seasons', 'treasure', 'wonderful', 'character', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'Sherry', 'Stringfield', 'gave', 'us.John', 'Carter', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'Carter', 'just', 'fresh', 'faced', 'eager', 'learn', 'young', '20-something', 'med', 'student', 'pilot', 'thrown', 'exciting', 'world', 'ER', 'medicine', 'surgery', 'when', 'deliver', 'baby', 'just', 'mother', 'hospital', 'doors.Carol', 'Hathaway', 'Jullianna', 'Margullies', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'notice', 'pilot', 'Jullianna', 'Margullies', 'listed', 'guest', 'star', 'not', 'put', 'main', 'cast', 'plan', 'was', 'have', 'die', 'first', 'episode', 'fortunately', 'got', 'stay', 'six', 'wonderful', 'seasons', 'character', 'lot', 'classic', 'ER', 'definately', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'people', 'work', 'County', 'General', 'pilot', 'learn', 'whole', 'lot', 'character', 'when', 'suicide', 'saved', 'friends', 'ER', 'following', 'episodes', 'revolve', 'very', 'much', 'returning', 'normal', 'life.Peter', 'Benton', 'Eriq', 'La', 'Salle', 'Benton', 'arrogant', 'little', 'prick', 'have', 'love', 'funny', 'note', 'seem', 'slightly', 'different', 'pilot', 'more', 'eager', 'cheerful', 'not', 'much', 'whatever', 'great', 'moments', 'first', 'episode', 'most', 'noticeably', 'when', 'emergency', 'surgery', 'assistance', 'up', 'saving', 'life.This', 'cast', 'show', 'now', 'twelfth', 'season', 'nice', 'enough', 'cast', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'original', 'six', 'who', 'stand', 'together', 'true', 'television', 'ensemble.The', 'first', 'season', 'just', 'wonderful', 'show', 'smoothly', 'churning', 'out', 'storylines', 'compelling', 'dramatic', 'heartbreaking', 'often', 'funny', 'perfect', 'combination', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'plenty', 'classic', 'episodes', 'including', 'famous', 'Love', 'Labor', 'Loss', 'may', 'have', 'saddest', 'ending', 'ER', 'episode', 'ever', 'Dr.', 'Greene', 'cries', 'quietly', 'knowledge', 'may', 'have', 'caused', 'death', 'new', 'mother', 'first', 'season', 'won', 'multiple', 'Emmys', 'deserved', 'more.Warner', 'Brothers', 'did', 'real', 'nice', 'job', 'DVD', 'set', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'caused', 'controversy', 'first', 'six', 'seasons', 'show', 'were', 'filmed', 'broadcast', 'fullscreen', 'format', 'bottomline', 'episodes', 'look', 'great', 'matted', 'match', 'later', 'seasons', 'nicely', 'have', 'complaints', 'are', 'decent', 'amound', 'supplemental', 'materials', 'nice', 'documementary', 'pilot', 'first', 'season', 'ER', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'made', 'kidding', ""'m"", 'still', 'big', 'fan', 'ER', 'currently', 'now', 'way', 'incredible', 'early', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'prime', 'example', 'ER', 'finest']",ER: Season 1

Marold""","[3, 3]","My beginning to watch the show ER on DVD is just a tad less rewarding than Sir Walter Raleigh's  finding the Lost City of Gold, since in spite of its running as a highly rewarded and well received series for 15 seasons, I watched but one episode, the final one in 2009. Somehow, it never fit into my life on Thursday evenings. And, by the time I watched that one episode, it was long past being a very tired cast, crew, and format.But, seeing it as it premiered in 1984, with a cast that was probably surpassed only by &#34;The West Wing&#34;, it was crackling with life and excitement and humanity. Compared to it, the 2012 series &#34;Monday Mornings&#34; was a highly mannered, pretentious shadow of the real thing which was &#34;ER&#34;. I could not keep my eyes off the screen, and I ordered Seasons 2 and 3 almost immediately. I can now look forward to several weeks of viewing the entire series at the rate of three to four episodes per night.The main cast is quite good, but it goes to new heights when the show is peppered with some outstanding guest appearances such as ER chiefs played by William H. Macy and Michael ironside, and cardiac surgeon, CCH Pounder, plus brother in law Ving Rhames. At first, I'm surprised at the brusque treatment and &#34;guidance&#34; 3rd year medical student Noah Wyle gets from his 2nd year surgical resident, Eriq La Salle. This is about as close as &#34;ER&#34; ever gets to the prima donna characterization of a doctor on &#34;House&#34;. In all other ways, it is the demonstration that &#34;House&#34; is a surreal abstraction of hospital behavior, far removed from reality.One almost senses that the level of activity in the average day in the &#34;ER&#34; is exaggerated. I've been in very few Emergency Rooms in my life, and they tend to be relatively quiet. But then again, this is in downtown Chicago, and a teaching hospital, which probably has the mandate to turn down no one. In one episode, at night, during a heavy snow storm, we see for a small part of one episode, what the ER looks like when it is not busy. That didn't last long.I have not yet seen any following seasons, but like &#34;The West Wing&#34; (same producer, John Wells), this show takes off from the opening scenes of the first episode, and never once drops the ball.",5,A genuinely first rate beginning to a distinguished series.,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,2292,"['beginning', 'watch', 'show', 'ER', 'DVD', 'just', 'tad', 'less', 'rewarding', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Raleigh', 'finding', 'Lost', 'City', 'Gold', 'spite', 'running', 'highly', 'rewarded', 'well', 'received', 'series', '15', 'seasons', 'watched', 'one', 'episode', 'final', 'one', '2009', 'Somehow', 'never', 'fit', 'life', 'Thursday', 'evenings', 'time', 'watched', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'long', 'past', 'being', 'very', 'tired', 'cast', 'crew', 'format.But', 'seeing', 'premiered', '1984', 'cast', 'was', 'probably', 'surpassed', 'only', '34', 'West', 'Wing', '34', 'was', 'crackling', 'life', 'excitement', 'humanity', 'Compared', '2012', 'series', '34', 'Monday', 'Mornings', '34', 'was', 'highly', 'mannered', 'pretentious', 'shadow', 'real', 'thing', 'was', '34', 'ER', '34', 'could', 'not', 'keep', 'eyes', 'screen', 'ordered', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'almost', 'immediately', 'can', 'now', 'look', 'forward', 'several', 'weeks', 'viewing', 'entire', 'series', 'rate', 'three', 'four', 'episodes', 'night.The', 'main', 'cast', 'quite', 'good', 'new', 'heights', 'when', 'show', 'peppered', 'outstanding', 'guest', 'appearances', 'such', 'ER', 'chiefs', 'played', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Michael', 'ironside', 'cardiac', 'surgeon', 'CCH', 'Pounder', 'brother', 'law', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'first', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'brusque', 'treatment', '34', 'guidance', '34', '3rd', 'year', 'medical', 'student', 'Noah', 'Wyle', '2nd', 'year', 'surgical', 'resident', 'Eriq', 'La', 'Salle', 'about', 'as', 'close', '34', 'ER', '34', 'ever', 'prima', 'donna', 'characterization', 'doctor', '34', 'House', '34', 'other', 'ways', 'demonstration', '34', 'House', '34', 'surreal', 'abstraction', 'hospital', 'behavior', 'far', 'removed', 'reality.One', 'almost', 'level', 'activity', 'average', 'day', '34', 'ER', '34', 'exaggerated', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'few', 'Emergency', 'Rooms', 'life', 'tend', 'be', 'relatively', 'quiet', 'then', 'again', 'downtown', 'Chicago', 'teaching', 'hospital', 'probably', 'mandate', 'turn', 'down', 'one', 'one', 'episode', 'night', 'heavy', 'snow', 'storm', 'see', 'small', 'part', 'one', 'episode', 'what', 'ER', 'when', 'not', 'busy', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long.I', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'following', 'seasons', '34', 'West', 'Wing', '34', 'same', 'producer', 'John', 'Wells', 'show', 'opening', 'scenes', 'first', 'episode', 'never', 'once', 'ball']",ER: Season 1

Premiering in September 1994 on NBC, the hour-long hospital drama vividly illustrates the intensity and fast-paced stress endemic to hospital emergency rooms across America. Brought into being by Michael Crichton - famous Hollywood insider, novelist, and brains behind such films as Jurassic Park, Twister, and Timeline - ER fulfills its creator's ultimate vision (it took over a decade of pitching the show before network executives bit) for a close-to-life glimpse of the technology and the humanity omnipresent in the ER. Since its inception, many cast members have passed through the halls of ER, many of them having gone on to become big stars in Hollywood...ER follows the exploits of a group of emergency room staff who work in a busy Chicago hospital. The show attempts to examine every detail of the ER experience. From the exhilaration of saving a life to the tedium caused by mountains of paperwork, all the highs and lows are covered. In the show's first year, a number of regular faces staffed the ER. Doctors Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle), Douglas Ross (George Clooney), and Susan Lewis (Sherri Stringfield) were regulars in the ER along with Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) and Benton's medical student understudy (and later ER doctor), John Carter (Noah Wyle)... Any given episode tends to run multiple plot lines throughout the show, interweaving scenes in short snippets intended to heighten audience emotion and create the aura of a stress-laden atmosphere. The show's high drama, coupled with subplots of the staffers' personal lives and the display of cutting edge medical technology, combine to make ER one of most adrenaline-inducing programs in television history...The ER (Season 1) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the series premiere ""24 Hours"" in which a long day in the ER is made longer when multiple casualties pour through the doors following the collapse of a building and medical students report for training (marking the first appearance for John Carter's character). Meanwhile, Dr. Benton performs a heart surgery normally reserved only for senior staff members while the staff is struck with a personal tragedy when Head Nurse Carol Hathaway is brought in following a suicide attempt... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Blizzard"" in which a major snowstorm first leads to an empty ER and then (following a 40-car pileup) one with overflowing capacity, and ""House of Cards"" in which, while trying to keep up with Carter, Deb nearly causes a patient's death...Below is a list of episodes included on the ER (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (24 Hours: Part 1)Episode 2 (24

600283,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00005JLFT,calvinnme,"[4, 5]","Some TV shows have a structure such that you can tell almost from the beginning how long the show has to live. As much as I love ""Scrubs"", that show is built around a few core characters, and once their stories are played out, that will pretty much be the end of that show. ""Cheers"" basically had a double length of life due to the fact it was actually two shows instead of one - the first 5 seasons with Diane and the last 6 seasons with Rebecca as the female lead. ""ER"" is different. It has a large cast of constantly revolving characters, and the storylines will always be there as long as there is controversy in medicine to merge with the personal drama. Early in ER's history, things were different. George Clooney's character, Doug Ross, was really the star of the show, although they did spread the stories around so that there was quite a bit of focus on the other characters too. This was a successful formula, but once Clooney became a star and a heartthrob he quickly tired of television and longed for the big screen. Thus, starting in season four, he is absent more and more as he goes off to make action films and the show began to look like it was going to suffer from ""Welcome Back Kotter"" syndrome, where John Travolta's success on the silver screen killed that show. After Clooney actually did formally exit stage left, the show changed the formula to its current one of spreading the action around with nobody in particular having the spotlight. I guess my point with all of this is, with ER already in its thirteenth season, this show could easily go on for years. The bundles of ER seasons are overpriced, so collecting this show season by season is probably your best bet. It's interesting to look at how season one was set up and look at the show today and see how it still holds up over time. At least, that is my humble opinion.",5,ER has a structure that sets it up for the long-term,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,1854,"['TV', 'shows', 'have', 'structure', 'such', 'can', 'tell', 'almost', 'beginning', 'how', 'long', 'show', 'live', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'Scrubs', 'show', 'built', 'few', 'core', 'characters', 'once', 'stories', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'will', 'pretty', 'much', 'be', 'end', 'show', 'Cheers', 'basically', 'had', 'double', 'length', 'life', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'actually', 'two', 'shows', 'instead', 'one', 'first', '5', 'seasons', 'Diane', 'last', '6', 'seasons', 'Rebecca', 'female', 'lead', 'ER', 'different', 'large', 'cast', 'constantly', 'revolving', 'characters', 'storylines', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'as', 'long', 'controversy', 'medicine', 'merge', 'personal', 'drama', 'Early', 'ER', 'history', 'things', 'were', 'different', 'George', 'Clooney', 'character', 'Doug', 'Ross', 'was', 'really', 'star', 'show', 'did', 'spread', 'stories', 'so', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'focus', 'other', 'characters', 'too', 'was', 'successful', 'formula', 'once', 'Clooney', 'became', 'star', 'heartthrob', 'quickly', 'tired', 'television', 'longed', 'big', 'screen', 'Thus', 'starting', 'season', 'four', 'absent', 'more', 'more', 'make', 'action', 'films', 'show', 'began', 'look', 'was', 'going', 'suffer', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'Kotter', 'syndrome', 'where', 'John', 'Travolta', 'success', 'silver', 'screen', 'killed', 'show', 'Clooney', 'actually', 'did', 'formally', 'exit', 'stage', 'left', 'show', 'changed', 'formula', 'current', 'one', 'spreading', 'action', 'nobody', 'particular', 'having', 'spotlight', 'guess', 'point', 'ER', 'already', 'thirteenth', 'season', 'show', 'could', 'easily', 'go', 'years', 'bundles', 'ER', 'seasons', 'are', 'overpriced', 'so', 'collecting', 'show', 'season', 'season', 'probably', 'best', 'bet', 'interesting', 'look', 'how', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'look', 'show', 'today', 'see', 'how', 'still', 'time', 'least', 'humble', 'opinion']",ER: Season 1

The acting is truly inspiring. Just fabulous. By ALL of them.I'm glad these shows are presented in the Widescreen format on this DVD set. Widescreen suits this series nicely (IMO).  And the video quality is very good.  As is the sound.  I had a minor ""glitch""/""freeze-up"" problem with one episode on Disc #2, which caused me to skip over a chapter.

There's an ample amount of stuff to delve into here, including multiple featurettes and audio commentaries, plus additional (unaired) scenes.  There's also a very funny outtakes/blooper reel (10 minutes) included. Anthony Edwards' ""That explains the hat"" ad-libbed remark after blowing a line is a standout from the blooper reel. :-)Be prepared to become totally immersed in the ""ER"" experience when you sit down to watch these DVDs.

No mention of quality of transfer, sound quality, etc, just negativities concerning the double sided discs.  I'm literally in disbelief that people are that inept, or they blame the disc b/c they own a silly DVD jukebox player incapable of flipping discs.  Hmmm...which one was the incorrect purchase I wonder.Nobody seems to mention that although original shown on TV in 4:3 full screen, this first season has been released in true 16x9 format.  Later seasons were/are shown in letterboxed format for all you analog TV watchers, but for those in the know, we watch ER in breathtaking HDTV 16x9 now with no black bars.  I greatly appreciate that the first season, originally shown for everyone in full screen format, have been released for us in widescreen format, the same as later seasons.In this respect, they really got it right.  4.5 stars only b/c more extras could always be added.  As for those upset b/c they need to, gasp, use their legs and fingers to flip the disc, shame on you.  Next time, for full lazy effect, buy a DVD player that flips your DVDs for you and stop complaining.  I mean, it's not like you have to flip the disc in the middle of an episode or anything.Oh and by the way, no they didnt just put black bars on the top and bottom of the picture like someone suggested cutting off the picture.  The widescreen anamorphic is the original way it was shot, they cut off the sides for the original tv presentation.  In other words, you are seeing parts of these episodes never before seen.  In fact, no black bars at all.  Anamorphic means they squeeze the widescreen down so all the content in viewable on a 4:3 tv.  On a widescreen tv, the picture doesnt look squeezed, but the content if the same for both 4:3 tvs and 16:9 tvs.  Obviously it doesn't really look right on the 4:3 tvs though.  But hey whatdya gonna do?

He's been quite down since Hockey died (it used to be his favorite show, as it was for all Canadians). Well, he's been going on about this show called ""ER"" for a while now, saying it's the best show on TV, and it finally came out for DVD. I never watched it when it was on, because, well to be short, it was a comedy/drama. When you have ""Digital"" cable there is always a good action-movie on. A few weeks ago, I was flippin' through the channels, and Rumble in the Bronx was on. I believe that was it's name, well I ended up watching that for a while but ended up turning it off because the voice-dubbing was messed up and started to drive me crazy, and also the lead actor could not act at all (you kind of need to act in order to be an actor, buddy). Now THAT was a frustrating situation. I'll tell you about it someday.Anyways, we watched about five episodes of ER before dad kicked us out of the living room to watch the Pistons game, but that was enough for me to get the gist of the show. It follows a young ""intern"", I guess he's not a real doctor yet, so he's probably on the same level as Dr. Bertrand. Anywho, the show starts off with his first day, and follows him as he adjusts to the new atmosphere, learns new techniques, practices said techniques, and things of that nature. To be honest, the show actually gave me a new respect for doctors. I always just knew the whole save-people's-lives aspect, I never knew that they played dress-up or surfed on the wheeled bed things.The greatest thing about this show is that it inspired me that when Morris (my dog) dies, I'm going to have him stuffed and keep him in my room, forever. That way I will always have a wrestling buddy. So as far as the star-count goes, starting at five (5) stars, I will deduct four (4) stars, for it not having any action in the show what-so-ever, but I will give two (2) stars for inspiring me to stuff Morris. In conclusion, don't believe what you see in the emergency-room, a little known fact is that all doctors are, are very educated and over-paid clowns.

600300,A36P3STLP32XQD,B00005JLFT,J. Y.,"[8, 9]","But a really good show!I can't say it was the gore, the drama, or the fact that I too was working in an ""ER"" but I started watching the show religiously during its airings from 9 to 11 on TNT. I used to work up at a level 1 trauma center in Chicago as an ED technician. I would work at night and thus have the mornings free to vegetate. I have been able to follow the show from the first season to what I believe is the sixth season (TNT cycles the episodes after it ends).I'll give you what I believe is the main reason why I am hooked to the show and then go on to bash what I think the show misportrays but what it ultimately inspires. Main reason- The show is about real characters. Drama, medical technical details aside, you get to heart of what makes ER a compelling medidrama- people with real issues, real flaws that work so tirelessly to help others. You feel for Nurse Hathaway or Dr. Greene. They aren't as one dimensional or as stereotypical as a sitcom character. You can identify with them as a protoganist but at the same time, dwell and anguish over their decisions and choices on the show.Some of the problems I have with the show are that of what makes the show compelling. A lot of medicine is not as engaging or as clear-cut as ER may make it seem. You see Doug, Carol, Mark, Benton work so tirelessy to help others. They're committed, dedicated, and passionate about their work. As a tech, working in a real ED, I found this lacking with a lot of residents and attendings. The reality is medicine at times has very few rewards, very few emotional peaks and ebs as ER would make you seem. There are very few thank yous, very few heart-agonizing moments. Sometimes, towards the end of a 12 hour shift, you feel numb to the work you've done.This is all to say I don't love what I do and what I'm going to get into (going to start med school this July). It's just ER is to medicine like Apprentice is to corporate business. The show's way too idealistic, overdramatic. But the point of a good show is not for it to be realistic which brings me in full circle to the main reason.A good show allows you to identify with its main characters, like Carol, Doug, Jeanie because they embody such heroic characteristics that you would want in yourself. The main characters are what you want out of doctors, PAs, nurses working in an ER. I wished doctors could all be a little more like Dr. Benton or Dr. Greene. I wish I too could work in a place like County Hospital, maybe starting as a lowly tech, working my way up the ladders.

The actors, story, music, editing, camera work and sooo much more combine to bring out the very best in entertainment.The only downside to this DVD comes with the packaging.

Clooney, on the other hand, is the wild child of the ER, frequently playing cowboy and getting himself into intense, but short romantic encounters.  Stringfield is Susan Lewis, who is likable but has a bit of a temper even though she is supposed to be sweet.  Margulies took some getting used to for me, but eventually I came around and enjoy seeing her on the show.  Since she's the Head Nurse she has a pretty important role.  And then there's La Salle, who does a great job playing the some-what jerk of a surgical resident.A tv show in a hospital is nothing new.  Which it is really why the actors drive this show.  Otherwise it would just be procedures, gore, and lots of sick people.  But with the cast and their different personalities and different lives, it makes it a little something different.  I do find the medical terminology intriguing, although I don't know enough to say whether or not it is accurate.  I'm going to assume that it's at least fairly accurate, or there would have been tons of outrage from the medical community when it aired.  Regardless, it makes for good viewing, and while not classified as educational, still better than some of the mindless cartoons out there!I do want to warn viewers that there is blood and violence and lots of things that may disturb viewers.  It also deals with a lot of different social issues like suicide and abortion.  So if you're not prepared to watch things like that, don't watch the show.I really enjoy this show and am looking forward to watching all the seasons I can get my hands on.Review by M.

600308,A3106VD94ULBKZ,B00005JLFT,"Nathan Bauer ""Movie Man""","[5, 6]",Wow incredible the first season of ER is finally coming to DVD with all of the special features that will be incredible to see.  The episode entitled Love Labors Lost is a very heartfelt episode. To me the fact that you have a great episode just focusing on one doctor trying his best to deliver a baby and is unsuccessful delivering and doing the surgery and saving the baby.  Then losing the mother in the end that was the saddest part of the episode.  Another episode is The Gift that ended the first half of the season is really good but is also sad in the fact that they had a patient coming in with brain damage and is brain dead.  They came in to harvest his organs and she did not want to have them harvest his organs.  But anyways the first season of ER was awesome because the fact that they won over Chicago Hope the first season was very good and they have been on ever since.  Chicago Hope was the only hospital show to get cancelled and not be shown again because the fact it kind of stunk were as ER every week they had a new and exciting episode and they brought in new cast member.  This year they brought back and original cast member Sherry Stringfield to reprise her role as Doctor Susan Lewis.  That was a very good move for NBC to bring her back because she and Anthony Edwards were the only two cast members to be on their for a while till Anthony Edwards character of Doctor Mark Greene was killed off in 2002 of brain cancer.

600311,A7Q1W04HT3EKS,B00005JLFT,"Phillip ""amazon_phil""","[10, 11]","Okay, I remember in the early 90's when NBC was beating the other networks with hits like Seinfeld, Friends, and this bigtime drama.  Well, this was probably the really big hit drama during the early 90's that no one will forget.  Now, I don't recognize today's ER cast and the people seem more Hollywood than struggling TV actors.  So, this first season really defines the heart of drama on TV which is giving a chance to those struggling TV actors to really shine.  Well, I guess George Clooney is the only one to break out of ER with big success.  The others managed to get out when the scripts ran out of steam after the 4th or 5th season.Well, the DVD treatment of this season is pretty standard.  Although I would have prefered a nicer box set with individual cases.  Anyways, the DVD package is a fold-away stack of double-sided DVDs.  Yeah, this probably was done to save cost so that the price would be affordable.  It's annoying to be super careful but hey, fewer discs in the end.  The menus are pretty much simple to use and some discs have extras.  My favorite was looking at the bloopers on the final disc.  Also, interviews with the cast was nice to see how the actors remember fondly on their times on ER.The picture quality of the episodes are first rate and seems almost perfect as it was on TV.  I don't have any complaints on the transfer since everything looks crisp.  So, there are no overly dark scenes which are difficult to see.  Plus, the audio is well done but I wished there were English subtitles.  Sometimes, the doctors, interns, and nurses speak too fast in the action that you want to catch part of their dialogue.  This was a major letdown for me since this should be the standard for all US released DVD in general (TV, movies, etc).Overall, this is a keeper and I would recommend this to watch again.  You really get to heart of disciple-pupil relationship between Carter and Benton as well as some funny fiascos of Deb Chen with trying to please Benton.  Plus, Dr. Ross and Nurse Hathaway plot is full of complications which is the more soapy stuff for daytime.  But, the writers balanced it off on the operating table and I think this season is probably the best in my humble opinion.  It makes me think that if doctors watched ER on a regular basis, then they would realize that the humanizing part of being doctors about understanding the patient is what we really appreciate.  Well, I just hope that my doctor turns out to be like Susan Lewis rather than Peter Benton.",5,Groundbreaking 90's Medical Drama,1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,2509,"['Okay', 'remember', 'early', '90', 'when', 'NBC', 'was', 'beating', 'other', 'networks', 'hits', 'Seinfeld', 'Friends', 'bigtime', 'drama', 'Well', 'was', 'probably', 'really', 'big', 'hit', 'drama', 'early', '90', 'one', 'will', 'forget', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'today', 'ER', 'cast', 'people', 'seem', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'struggling', 'TV', 'actors', 'So', 'first', 'season', 'really', 'heart', 'drama', 'TV', 'giving', 'chance', 'struggling', 'TV', 'actors', 'really', 'shine', 'Well', 'guess', 'George', 'Clooney', 'only', 'one', 'break', 'ER', 'big', 'success', 'others', 'managed', 'get', 'out', 'when', 'scripts', 'ran', 'steam', '4th', '5th', 'season.Well', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'season', 'pretty', 'standard', 'would', 'have', 'prefered', 'nicer', 'box', 'set', 'individual', 'cases', 'Anyways', 'DVD', 'package', 'fold-away', 'stack', 'double-sided', 'DVDs', 'Yeah', 'probably', 'was', 'done', 'save', 'cost', 'price', 'would', 'be', 'affordable', 'annoying', 'be', 'super', 'careful', 'hey', 'fewer', 'discs', 'end', 'menus', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'simple', 'use', 'discs', 'have', 'extras', 'favorite', 'was', 'looking', 'bloopers', 'final', 'disc', 'Also', 'interviews', 'cast', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'how', 'actors', 'remember', 'fondly', 'times', 'ER.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'episodes', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'almost', 'perfect', 'was', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'complaints', 'transfer', 'everything', 'crisp', 'So', 'are', 'overly', 'dark', 'scenes', 'are', 'difficult', 'see', 'audio', 'well', 'done', 'wished', 'were', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Sometimes', 'doctors', 'interns', 'nurses', 'speak', 'too', 'fast', 'action', 'want', 'catch', 'part', 'dialogue', 'was', 'major', 'letdown', 'should', 'be', 'standard', 'US', 'released', 'DVD', 'general', 'TV', 'movies', 'etc', '.Overall', 'keeper', 'would', 'recommend', 'watch', 'again', 'really', 'get', 'heart', 'disciple-pupil', 'relationship', 'Carter', 'Benton', 'as', 'well', 'funny', 'fiascos', 'Deb', 'Chen', 'trying', 'please', 'Benton', 'Dr.', 'Ross', 'Nurse', 'Hathaway', 'plot', 'full', 'complications', 'more', 'soapy', 'stuff', 'daytime', 'writers', 'balanced', 'off', 'operating', 'table', 'think', 'season', 'probably', 'best', 'humble', 'opinion', 'think', 'doctors', 'watched', 'ER', 'regular', 'basis', 'then', 'would', 'realize', 'humanizing', 'part', 'being', 'doctors', 'understanding', 'patient', 'what', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Well', 'just', 'hope', 'doctor', 'out', 'be', 'Susan', 'Lewis', 'rather', 'Peter', 'Benton']",ER: Season 1

For the most part this is an excellent series, but not quite as good as ""Grey's Anatomy,"" because I didn't identify as closely with the characters.  Anthony Edwards is fine in the lead, and George Clooney is surprisingly good.  The one character I found distasteful was the one played by Eriq La Salle.  I don't think it was the actor's fault.  He didn't write the lines, nor was he the director.  It's just that his character is always negative and makes all sorts of contorted, smirking faces to show his displeasure at everything, and with everyone.The story lines are quite good, and most of the characters feel exactly right.  The sets couldn't be better.  As an aside, however,I can't imagine why anyone would want to work in the emergency room of a hospital.  I have, alas, gone through emergency rooms as a patient, and it's amazing that doctors and nurses there can keep some semblance of sanity.I did feel tense in watching the chapters of this dvd set.

600314,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B00005JLFT,Sean Pasek,"[4, 4]","Throughout most of the late 80s and early 90s, drama was essentially dead on television.  Most of the line-ups were sitcoms.  Popular shows were Cheers, Cosby Show, and Seinfeld.  Many of the popular dramas of the early 80s were all but gone or nearing their end.In 1993, NYPD Blue came a long and cracked things open, but in 1994, ER exploded on the scene.  I still recall seeing the pilot episode for the first time.  Somehow I knew right away that I was watching television history in the making: this show was going to not only be around for a long time, but I knew it was also going to have a large audience.Those of you, like me, who have grown a bit complacent and tired of ER in recent years may have forgotten the original cast, the stories, and excitement that started it.  I had forgotten just how good this show was.  I hadn't seen the first season since it aired, with the exception of one episode that I'd taped (Love's Labor Lost).Another medical drama, Chicago Hope, made its debut the same year that ER did.  There's a big reason that ER won out.  While Chicago Hope had interesting stories, it was still using the old stationary motion from the dramas of yester-year.  ER revolutionized dramatic television.  In fact, many dramas today credit ER with its almost constant movement.  Rather than have its characters standing still, they moved.  They walked corridors at the brisk pace that ER doctors might.  Cameras whirled around a trauma patient as four or five doctors and nurses worked on the patient.  The camera movement alone created excitement and the good kind of tension that made you wonder what kind of emergency would come through those ER doors next.  Watch these earlier episodes, and you'll notice quickly that whenever there is a trauma, the music kicks in and cameras speed up their pace and movement.  For audiences were grew tired of the dull stationary cameras, this was new, fresh, and a whole lot of fun!ER's original cast simply can't be topped.  Many actors and actresses have walked and continue to walk the halls of ER, but there's only one Dr. Mark Greene, played superbly by Anthony Edwards.  He plays Greene with a reserve and confidence of someone who makes everything look easy.  As the Chief Resident, he runs the ER, and he does it both smoothly and proficiently.  He's also a man conflicted between his job which he loves and his family.  Season one sees him trying to find a resolution between leaving the job he loves or risk losing his family.Then there's womanizer, Dr. Doug Ross.  George Clooney plays Ross with all the charm and boyishness that seems to win women over with a look.  He's unable to commit, and he leaves a trail of emotional baggage a mile long.  Perhaps his former girlfriend nurse Carol Hathaway describes him best with the line, ""Doug is a little boy who wants what he can't have.""Sherry Stringfield has wonderful as Dr. Susan Lewis.  She's cute and vivacious, and gives these elements to Lewis.  Lewis also has a problem standing up for herself.  She's generally a pleaser who is afraid of losing the affection and faith of those closest to her.  Perhaps her biggest nemesis is her own sister who is all but inept.  She and Greene are close friends, and one had to wonder if anything might come of it.Eriq La Salle was a perfect choice to play the arrogant, driven, and extremely talented Dr. Peter Benton who is a second-year surgical resident.  Benton is devoted to his job and little else.  Someone can lose count of the number of times we hear him yell at the nurses, ""Come on, let's move people!""  La Salle makes Benton move at light speed.  He's always in motion, and even when he's stationary, you can see the energy that La Salle gives to Benton, that standing around is his least favorite thing.Who has forgotten the great charm and clumsy character of the first year for Dr. John Carter played by Noah Wyle?  Before he became the proficient doctor we see in later seasons, we forget that Carter was a young medical student trying to survive his first year under Dr. Benton's instruction.  Carter was a slightly nerdish, always wearing suspenders and expensive shirts, and yet he's always at the center when a laugh is needed to break the tension.  Everything seems to happen to him.  He's peed on, vomited on, and another med student hands him the cardio paddles with the wrong end, thus sending three hundred volts of electricity into the unsuspecting Carter and sending him unconscious to the floor.The stories are crisp and strong in this first season.  Quite possibly one of the best single episodes of ANY series I've ever watched is here.  Love's Labor Lost was an Emmy Award winning episode.  It's an incredible episode featuring Dr. Greene attempting to deliver a baby until things go horribly wrong.  Anthony Edwards was nothing short of perfect in this episode.  Try watching this one without feeling the stress and tension that Greene feels.  It's nearly impossible.So, if you're anxious to recapture some fond memories with the original cast of ER and remember why this show started off so well, then you can't go wrong with the first season of ER.",5,The Drama Series That ReDefined Drama,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,5148,"['most', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'drama', 'was', 'essentially', 'dead', 'television', 'Most', 'line-ups',

As an avid reader, and more recently a nursing student, I've always understood the jargon, which made the show a lot easier to follow than it otherwise would have been, but this past year working as a nurse's aide on a cancer ward drove home just how realistic this show truly is.  Posted on a bulletin board at work one day was a list titled &quot;You know you're a nurse when...&quot; that included &quot;...you can't watch ER because it's too much like real life.&quot;  And that's the simple truth.  Every emergency room in every hospital obviously isn't always as hectic and dramatic as this show, but many are, and all are at one time or another.  And, taken collectively, true-to-life stories hospital-wide are accurately portrayed, but in the context of an ER so that they can easily be told in the short period of a one hour drama.  Being an evening worker on and off over the years, I've missed far too many episodes of this incredible, heartrending, heartwarming show. I welcome this opportunity to buy the entire first season, and I look forward to more seasons being made available.

600322,A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R,B00005JLFT,"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[14, 16]","By now the television series ""ER"" has become an iconic cornerstone in NBC's imensly popular Thursday night lineup.  For almost a decade and a half the series has been NBC's pride and joy.  But the series that regularly air's now (in 2006) is just a shadow of its former brilliance.  Season One returns the audience back to when `ER' just wasn't quality television, but the definition of ""Must-see-TV.""  A time when there weren't enough Awards and Accolaid to describe the magical television show that was being created - and one that has its roots so firmly established in the American psyche it will honestly never be forgotten.The best way to describe the first season of `ER' is through the young, innocent, and unexperienced eyes of John Carter, 3rd year medical student studying to become a surgeon.  Throughout the first season's 25 episodes, John learns not only the in-and-outs of the emERgency room, but the hospital politics, and emotional toles that his chosen profession comes with.  On his first day he meets his cold, but amazing teacher Dr. Peter Benton as well as the charismatic Dr. Greene, a family man trying to decide between staying in the hospital after his residency or going into private practice.  Additionally the first season features Dr. Ross (and egotistical playboy), Nurse Hathaway (a quiet, carrying woman with too much on her plate), and Dr. Susan Lewis.The first season establishes the tone of the series very early on, and it begins to create a formula, still in use today.  In any given episode there are several patient guest-stars and drive the storylines, but more times than not it is the personal lives, feelings, and emotions of the regular doctors that come front and center in these episodes.  The show isn't about the patients, but how the patients effect the doctors and the personal lives that they live.ER and easily not only one of the best television shows on television, but one of the best television shows to ever grace the small-screen, and that is never as more evident than in the series inaugural season.- 24 Hours- Day One- Going Home- Hit and Run- Into that good Night- Chicago heat- Another Perfect Day- 9 1/2 Hours- ER Confidential- Blizzard- Teh Gift- Happy New York- Luck of the Draw- Long Day's Journey- Feb. 5, '95""- Make of Two Hearts- The Birthday Party- Sleepless in Chicago- Loves's Labor Lost- Full Moon, Saturday Night- House of Cards- Men Plan, God Laughs- Love among the Ruins- Motherhood- Everything Old is New AgainThis is a wonderful season and if it ever gets put of DVD you must purchase it.",5,I just love ER,1033516800,"10 2, 2002",2002,2569,"['now', 'television', 'series', 'ER', 'become', 'iconic', 'cornerstone', 'NBC', 'imensly', 'popular', 'Thursday', 'night', 'lineup', 'almost', 'decade', 'half', 'series', 'been', 'NBC', 'pride', 'joy', 'series', 'regularly', 'air', 'now', '2006', 'just', 'shadow', 'former', 'brilliance', 'Season', 'One', 'audience', 'back', 'when', 'ER', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'quality', 'television', 'definition', 'Must-see-TV', 'time', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Awards', 'Accolaid', 'describe', 'magical', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'being', 'created', 'one', 'roots', 'so', 'firmly', 'established', 'American', 'psyche', 'will', 'honestly', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten.The', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'first', 'season', 'ER', 'young', 'innocent', 'unexperienced', 'eyes', 'John', 'Carter', '3rd', 'year', 'medical', 'student', 'studying', 'become', 'surgeon', 'first', 'season', '25', 'episodes', 'John', 'not', 'only', 'in-and-outs', 'emERgency', 'room', 'hospital', 'politics', 'emotional', 'toles', 'chosen', 'profession', 'first', 'day', 'cold', 'amazing', 'teacher', 'Dr.', 'Peter', 'Benton', 'as', 'well', 'charismatic', 'Dr.', 'Greene', 'family', 'man', 'trying', 'decide', 'staying', 'hospital', 'residency', 'going', 'private', 'practice', 'Additionally', 'first', 'season', 'features', 'Dr.', 'Ross', 'egotistical', 'playboy', 'Nurse', 'Hathaway', 'quiet', 'carrying', 'woman', 'too', 'much', 'plate', 'Dr.', 'Susan', 'Lewis.The', 'first', 'season', 'tone', 'series', 'very', 'early', 'create', 'formula', 'still', 'use', 'today', 'given', 'episode', 'are', 'several', 'patient', 'guest-stars', 'drive', 'storylines', 'more', 'times', 'not', 'personal', 'lives', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'regular', 'doctors', 'come', 'front', 'center', 'episodes', 'show', ""n't"", 'patients', 'how', 'patients', 'effect', 'doctors', 'personal', 'lives', 'live.ER', 'easily', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'shows', 'television', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'shows', 'ever', 'grace', 'small-screen', 'never', 'more', 'evident', 'series', 'inaugural', 'season.-', '24', 'Hours-', 'Day', 'One-', 'Going', 'Home-', 'Hit', 'Run-', 'Into', 'good', 'Night-', 'Chicago', 'heat-', 'Perfect', 'Day-', '9', '1/2', 'Hours-', 'ER', 'Confidential-', 'Blizzard-', 'Teh', 'Gift-', 'Happy', 'New', 'York-', 'Luck', 'Draw-', 'Long', 'Day', 'Journey-', 'Feb.', '5', 'Make', 'Two', 'Hearts-', 'Birthday', 'Party-', 'Sleepless', 'Chicago-', 'Loves', 'Labor', 'Lost-', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Saturday', 'Night-', 'House', 'Cards-', 'Men', 'Plan', 'God', 'Laughs-', 'Love', 'Ruins-', 'Motherhood-', 'Everything', 'Old', 'New', 'AgainThis', 'wonderful', 'season', 'ever', 'put', 'DVD', 'must', 'purchase']",ER: Season 1
