Pretty much follows the story line of the original with some changes. (I don't want to spoil it for you) Very creepy, keeps you interest. My only complaint about this movie is Rutger Hauer's part was too small. I would have loved to have added at least 10 or 15 minutes more of his screen time.

The whole production is of high enough quality to make you think, ""Wow this isn't bad...in fact, it's kinda good...in fact, I LOVE IT!""The cast does an outstanding job bringing this creepshow to life.  Andre Braugher, Donald Sutherland, and James Cromwell??? (even Rob Lowe who I've never been a big fan of is both smart and moving)  Plus who else could you want as Barlowe than Rudger Haugher?  The supporting cast has their moments as well (also their doozies too, I'll admit) but mostly everyone stands up with the big boys or at least remains solid.I also enjoyed the writing.  Rob Lowe's narration established the mood well and seemed to have been taken right out the book - which I always appreciate.  The television adaptation was modern, much to the horror of many reviewers here.  I personally I thought making Andre Braugher's character homosexual worked.  Nor did I mind their making Ben Mears former Iraqi war journalist - it brought the timeless tale into the here and now, and tied in well to his character arc.I have to say I also enjoyed the music.  Lisa Garard's vocals haven't sounded this good on a soundtrack since Gladiator and the producers milked it for all it was worth.This might not be Hamlet but it's as good a Stephen King treatment as you'll find anywhere, especially among the tv mini-series which usually suffer from weak performances or lack of any real swagger.

842689,A39KJOCZGCM8P1,B0002OXVG4,Chris Lee Mullins,"[4, 11]","I'll have to admit, the original 'Salem's Lot TV Film by Tobe Hooper had some creepy moments. To this day, the image of the boy floating in front of Mark's window stands up there with anything produced for wide release. However, it deviated from the book significantly. The most amazing (and lame) change being that Barlow never said a word. He was just one creepy looking Nosferatu.The biggest difference between Hooper's adaptation and Mikael Salomon's adaptation is the sense you get of the town of Jerusalem's Lot. More time is given in this recent adaptation to the various characters in the town. You get more of an impression that not only are the townspeople being slaughtered, but the town itself.Rob Lowe does a decent job playing Ben Mears. Suitably intense and way beyond the range I expected of him. Also a standout is Robert Mammone, playing the town doctor. Andre Braugher's part is something of a throwaway, as is Sutherland's. Rutger Hauer is passably evil playing Barlow, but the character still feels short-shrifted somehow. Barlow didn't scare me at all, not like Tobe Hooper's version.I was majorly disappointment with the character arc of Father Callahan, played well by James Cromwell, especially given the amount attention Callahan gets as a character in Stephen King's ""Dark Tower"" series. I realize it shouldn't mean anything in regards to this miniseries, but it irked nevertheless.Overall, this new adaptation hits most of the right marks. It still feels like a TV movie, despite some of the special effects. Don't get rid of your old Hooper version, though.

Terhune ""Ed T.""","[16, 27]","I'm sort of writing this is response to all the negative reviews of the movie I've read here, something I normally wouldn't do. I came at this from a different angle, I think. I'm not particularly a Stephen King fan; my reaction to his written work is one of ambivalence. I think he's an entertaining, engaging storyteller, but he's hardly a great writer, at least in my humble opinion. His characters are almost never convincing or genuine, his dialogue is contrived, artificial, his story endings almost invariably lose steam and go flat, and he seems to share Steven Spielberg's weakness of inserting the ""precocious"" child into nearly every storyline. Having said all that, ""Salem's Lot"" was probably my favorite of King's books. For all the weaknesses mentioned above, and more, it worked (albeit in the way a lurid comic-book can work), and has been a favorite of mine through the years. The TV movie of 1979 was a bitter disappointment. Granted, James Mason is one of the all-time great actors, but making him the centerpiece and relegating the character of Barlow to a non-speaking Nosferatu rip-off was truly a misguided move. One thing one can say of the book, regardless of its flaws, is that it wasn't boring. The 79 tv movie was boring. Not so this new adaptation. Yes, liberties are also taken with the original story, but they show true inspiration and imagination, virtues sadly lacking from the 79 version. It many ways, to my mind, the innovations enhance King's story. The characters come across as more fragile, more damaged, and nuanced, less stereotypical, more disturbed and, hence, more disturbing. The acting is first-rate; I'm no big fan of Rob Lowe, but he's surprisingly effective here. Also, Rutger Hauer is not the actor I would have picked to play Barlow, but he does his job admirably, with commendable restraint and presence, and my only quibble is that the character isn't given more screen time. The whole atmosphere conveys a sense of a dark, crawling pestilence and aura of miasmic menace that was missing even from King's book, much less the 1979 travesty supposedly based on that work (and if you think King's concept was really all that original, check out the low-budget movie ""Return of Dracula"" from the 1950's with Francis Lederer). Is this the best vampire movie ever made? Hardly. But it's probably the best film adaptation of King's work that's ever been made, and considering that artists as diverse as Stanley Kubrick and David Cronenberg have offered their own interpretations of King's work, that's not faint praise.",4,"Entertaining, Imaginative",1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,2567,"[""'m"", 'sort', 'writing', 'response', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'read', 'here', 'something', 'normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'came', 'different', 'angle', 'think', ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fan', 'reaction', 'written', 'work', 'one', 'ambivalence', 'think', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'storyteller', 'hardly', 'great', 'writer', 'least', 'humble', 'opinion', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'never', 'convincing', 'genuine', 'dialogue', 'contrived', 'artificial', 'story', 'endings', 'almost', 'invariably', 'lose', 'steam', 'go', 'flat', 'share', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'weakness', 'inserting', 'precocious', 'child', 'nearly', 'storyline', 'Having', 'said', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'was', 'probably', 'favorite', 'King', 'books', 'weaknesses', 'mentioned', 'more', 'worked', 'way', 'lurid', 'comic-book', 'can', 'work', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'years', 'TV', 'movie', '1979', 'was', 'bitter', 'disappointment', 'Granted', 'James', 'Mason', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'actors', 'making', 'centerpiece', 'relegating', 'character', 'Barlow', 'non-speaking', 'Nosferatu', 'rip-off', 'was', 'truly', 'misguided', 'move', 'One', 'thing', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'book', 'regardless', 'flaws', 'was', ""n't"", 'boring', '79', 'tv', 'movie', 'was', 'boring', 'Not', 'so', 'new', 'adaptation', 'Yes', 'liberties', 'are', 'also', 'taken', 'original', 'story', 'show', 'true', 'inspiration', 'imagination', 'virtues', 'sadly', 'lacking', '79', 'version', 'many', 'ways', 'mind', 'innovations', 'enhance', 'King', 'story', 'characters', 'come', 'more', 'fragile', 'more', 'damaged', 'nuanced', 'less', 'stereotypical', 'more', 'disturbed', 'hence', 'more', 'disturbing', 'acting', 'first-rate', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'here', 'Also', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'not', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'picked', 'play', 'Barlow', 'job', 'admirably', 'commendable', 'restraint', 'presence', 'only', 'quibble', 'character', ""n't"", 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'whole', 'atmosphere', 'sense', 'dark', 'crawling', 'pestilence', 'aura', 'miasmic', 'menace', 'was', 'missing', 'even', 'King', 'book', 'much', 'less', '1979', 'travesty', 'supposedly', 'based', 'work', 'think', 'King', 'concept', 'was', 'really', 'original', 'check', 'out', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'Return', 'Dracula', '1950', 'Francis', 'Lederer', 'best', 'vampire', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Hardly', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'adaptation', 'King', 'work', 'ever', 'been', 'made', 'considering', 'as', 'diverse', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'have', 'offered', 'own', 'interpretations', 'King', 'work', 'not', 'faint', 'praise']",Salem's Lot - The Miniseries

842697,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B0002OXVG4,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 1]","SALEM'S LOTI happen to like this updated mini series from the King classic which was also adapted much earlier into a mini series with Tobe Hooper at the helm. This version is not that movie and is not exactly like the book either but I must say that I found it really entertaining. From the acting to the over all story this just seemed like a good time to me, those around me agreed. Even though it is not completely faithful to the original work it is still worthy enough that King put his name on it, there have been others he hated enough to not have his named attached no more.The story is the same about a writer coming back to his hometown and an unspeakable evil is lying in wait. Of course you all know that the evil in which I speak is vampires with Barlow [Rutger Hauer] of course as the lead heel in this. As the small town slowly starts to die around poor Ben Mears [Rob Lowe] who is still traumatized to an incident as a youth he starts to realize something is going on. People are disappearing and others are acting a bit strange and this all coincides with the arrival of Mears and the never seen around town Kurt Barlow. Barlow's assistant Richard Straker [Donald Sutherland] is out and about running an antique store, he is an odd fellow. But when it all comes down to it there are some vampires running around and a select few have to step up and take them down. Those few are probably the most unique and diverse group of hunters ever but hey it makes for a good time. There is the returning home writer who witnessed a murder/suicide as a child in Mears, the doctor who is sleeping with a patient and also being set up by her in Dr. James Cody [Robert Mammone], the priest who may be more gone then he appears in Father Donald Callahan [James Cromwell], a school teacher who likes the fellas in Matt Burke [Andre Braugher],  and of course a kid named Mark Petrie [Daniel Byrd] who has more lives than a cat.That group comes together to stop this evil virus that has invaded the town and they may or may not be successful. Director Mikael Salomon keeps things moving and makes the film look very atmospheric but at times the film seems uneven. Sometimes one thing will be going on and the next we switch gears, some films do that intentionally but I doubt this film was supposed to do that. Still it is an enjoyable film and writer Peter Filardi did a decent enough job up dating this film into today's world. The film looks good and there are actually some pretty good moments in this version of the King classic.As far as performances go I think every one was up to par and delivered well, no weak performances as least from what I could see. Rob Lowe as always been a favorite of mine and did a good job in this film in the lead role. Rutger Hauer was good as the evil lead vampire named Barlow and pulled of the role well, as did his side kick played by the great Donald Sutherland. As for the rest of the hunters that accompanied Rob in this film they all did great jobs. Robert Mammone was excellent as Dr. Cody and was one of my favorites in the film and James Cromwell was equally as good as the disgruntled priest. Andre Braugher was great in his role bringing something very new to the character and of course the surprise of the film Daniel Byrd was good in this as well, in fact his character may be the best and most fearless of the hunters.Every one else in this film was great as well with like I said no one giving a bad performance at all. If you did not catch this one TV or even if you did I recommend this one to every one, it's good for a lazy Friday night or Saturday. To all King fans out there this may be a disappointment to you if you don't give it a chance, just know that this is an up date for our time we live in now with cell phones and all that stuff.

842699,A3DLJJU8LGYVJM,B0002OXVG4,Gary Cross,"[5, 13]","Come on guys - it's not THAT bad. In fact, I'll put my neck out and say that it's better than the original (which did tend to drag on a bit). True, there are a heck of a lot of characters to keep tabs on, and with a couple of exceptions they're all thinly drawn, but I remember Stephen King saying way back that he intended Salem's Lot to be Peyton Place with vampires, so the mass of characters shown here is, I believe, in keeping with the author's original vision. It does have it's faults; the main one being that for the first hour we're treated to Ben Mear's bitter diatribe about the small town and how all the people in it are a pack of ratbags. As a result, we don't really care what happens to them. Things shift in the second half (after one of the characters says that Ben only sees the bad in people and ignores the good), but by then the damage has been done. I was also a bit uncomfortable with the climax, where fast moving vampires suddenly became shambling flesh-eating zombies.Otherwise, I felt this was an enjoyable piece of horror pulp that worked as well as it could within the confines of a TV movie (it really needs to be turned into a three hour horror epic for the big screen where all of King's sexual and violent visions can be given full rein). Visually it's far superior to Tobe Hooper's version, and we've got a better cast (Donald Sutherland hams it up wonderfully and James Cromwell's interpretation of the priest who has fallen from grace is suitably seedy). Rob Lowe is a much more haunted man than David Soul, Rutger Hauer's Barlow is far superior to Reggie Nalder's Nosferatu rip-off, and even if the bulk of the supporting players are Australians and New Zealanders putting on broad American accents (which is always a weird experience for a New Zealander to watch), they all do a fine job.

Im thinking, as im watching the affair part as the doctor is saying he'll have his 10 thousand dollars by the dead mans body you'd assume they have him say it by the boys mother who became a vampire. That would've been a creepy good plot as the mother vampire is waking up she is spilling the doctors lil secret to him and Ben mears and than bites the doctor on the neck. The acting is superb in this movie, but i think they could've found a better man to play the part as the governor of the town in fact i know of several other men who would've given that part more justice and been more convincing. I would've taken out the incest of the governor and his daughter i mean its really unnecessary and takes to much film time showing that when they could've used that extra time to put in other parts of the book involved.What also doesnt seem right is the zombies. Thats way to overwhelming to add zombies and vampires they should've just kept the vampires only than adding zombies its to overwhelming. Even the man dying in the teachers house was clearly a waste. They should've stuck to that original plot where he is sitting in the rocking chair in the dark as it should've been and shown his eyes gleaming than stops rocking in the chair and slowly opens his eyes and grins at them. Gosh in the original movie when i seen it as a kid that scared me the most had dreams about that for months.

842707,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0002OXVG4,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 3]","This recent (2004) TV film is adapted from Stephen King's novel Salem's Lot. This adaptation had been waited for and expected by many years since the first old adaptation and especially the scandalous second episode that had transformed Jerusalem's Lot into a blood farm for a community of vampires. This adaptation is very faithful to the novel though it adds a different end in concentrating the hatred against vampires onto the probably catholic priest who had been obliged to drink some of the vampire's blood, going as far as making the main character trace him in New York and kill him, though in a traditional way, which makes us doubt he will die. The second element in this film is the great dynamism, the upgrading and updating of the world that has cell phones and other modern technology. This gives to the film a modern look and feel and that is good and bracing. The characters are also speaking today's language and behaving in today's fashion. The film has also gotten rid of some of the gross surreal if not supernatural elements in the very looks of the two culprits, the vampire and his ghoul. They look so much more human than in previous adaptations. But I remain doubtful about the message of the film, or of the novel. The vampire is in no way regenerated and the myth is taken in exactly the same terms as it had always been taken, or nearly, up to Anne Rice's rewriting of it. I think this vision is making the audience get used to the necessity to kill and destroy the foreigner because he is the very image of evil, even if he does not look evil at all. This adaptation also has the merit of lightening the sentimental side of things, the various love affairs and the innuendo about such possible sexual perspectives. Everything is better concentrated on the vampire and his action and conquest of the town.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,More dynamic but still the same old tale,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,1970,"['recent', '2004', 'TV', 'film', 'adapted', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'adaptation', 'had', 'been', 'waited', 'expected', 'many', 'years', 'first', 'old', 'adaptation', 'especially', 'scandalous', 'second', 'episode', 'had', 'transformed', 'Jerusalem', 'Lot', 'blood', 'farm', 'community', 'vampires', 'adaptation', 'very', 'faithful', 'novel', 'different', 'end', 'concentrating', 'hatred', 'vampires', 'probably', 'catholic', 'priest', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'obliged', 'drink', 'vampire', 'blood', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'making', 'main', 'character', 'trace', 'New', 'York', 'kill', 'though', 'traditional', 'way', 'doubt', 'will', 'die', 'second', 'element', 'film', 'great', 'dynamism', 'upgrading', 'updating', 'world', 'cell', 'phones', 'other', 'modern', 'technology', 'film', 'modern', 'look', 'feel', 'good', 'bracing', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'speaking', 'today', 'language', 'behaving', 'today', 'fashion', 'film', 'also', 'gotten', 'rid', 'gross', 'surreal', 'not', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'very', 'two', 'culprits', 'vampire', 'ghoul', 'look', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'previous', 'adaptations', 'remain', 'doubtful', 'message', 'film', 'novel', 'vampire', 'way', 'regenerated', 'myth', 'taken', 'exactly', 'same', 'terms', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'taken', 'nearly', 'up', 'Anne', 'Rice', 'rewriting', 'think', 'vision', 'making', 'audience', 'get', 'used', 'necessity', 'kill', 'destroy', 'foreigner', 'very', 'image', 'evil', 'even', 'not', 'look', 'evil', 'adaptation', 'also', 'merit', 'lightening', 'sentimental', 'side', 'things', 'various', 'love', 'affairs', 'innuendo', 'such', 'possible', 'sexual', 'perspectives', 'Everything', 'better', 'concentrated', 'vampire', 'action', 'conquest', 'town.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",Salem's Lot - The Miniseries

Better casting, better acting, no Kubrick, and better effects.  1979 was a laugh-fest, this one actually made me jump a bit.2)  Not as good as the book.  Too much artistic freedom in swaying from the book.  There is not much benetration with the characters the way the book does.  And with the recent completion of the Dark Tower Series, Father Callahan is handled completely wrong.  Despite this, I still have the book I can go back to and visit if I want to get the story right.3)  Entertaining.  If you've got nothing else to watch, you should catch this once.  I doubt I'll ever watch it again, but I can't say that this was a complete waste of my time.4)  Not for young-ones.  Make sure you put the kiddies to bed before sitting down to watch this.  This is most definately not for children despite the fact that it is made for TV.5)  Didn't stick to the ""rules.""  Despite the flaws of this movie, the biggest one is the rules.

If you have read a book of his it is like watching a movie.  Several movies based on his books have not done well because, I suspect, the reader has too strong of a mental image of what the movie should look like.  Judge this on its own merits, which are considerable.Lowe gives a solid performance as Ben.  His voice over, though not King's words, is good and gives a nice feel to the film.  The sets are superior to the old version and add to the growing creepiness of a twon being take over by evil.  They also do a really good job of making the house an evil character.

It is hard, when  you have Rob Lowe, Donald Sutherland, and Rutger Hauer involved, to make a bad miniseries. However, as this one demonstrates, not impossible.I understand why one of the book-events got edited out.  If the writers had let writer Ben Mears informally adopt orphan Mark Petrie after the denouement, as in the book, they would have had every underoccupied paranoiac howling accusations of collusion with NAMBLA. But the rest of the novel Salem's Lot provides a perfectly fine and respectable plot line, which the screenwriters might have followed closely with excellent results.Salem's Lot, as written, takes place in Maine. The landscape and atmospherics of Maine are not mere cosmetic aspects of setting in this work; they are very central and should and could have been authentic. Why wasn't this thing filmed in Maine, where there are plenty of suitable locations that could have been rented dirt cheap, instead of some obviously far-more-temperate location, with obvious leafy green vegetation sprayed with fake snow?Though Salem's Lot is a very filmable novel, the first film made of it was pretty lame, and this one is downright annoying.

842720,A2AVSKPLMDEBJT,B0002OXVG4,"LILyte Review ""Mercy""","[1, 5]","A very long movie that has confusion written all over it due to the shifting of time from present to past...now where have i seen that before? I know i haven't read Stephen King's noval yet so that might have something to do with my early confusion but come on, give us some hints man....i know there is some narration at the beginning but that didn't help me one bit with all the little subplots going on. The main plot you wonder? When Rob Lowe was a little kid, he took a dare into the house and witness something that change his life forever. He comes back years later and you see him throw a Priest out the window, who happen to be working on Thanksgiving day giving out food to the homeless and hungry. Did it had anything to do with what happen when he was a little kid? Watch and see :o)I will admit that even tho one can get confused from the very start while watching this movie as all the things is happening so fast around the many characters in this town, u get a sense that the director is losing his direction but it does work well because it adds suspense and the scenes are quite scary in a weird way. I didn't get bored one bit so that says alot too, especially since i seen so many crappy vampyre movies including some of the best like Blade and Interview with a Vampyre, my two all-time favorites for this genre.I like to say to Rob Lowe, your acting was quite convincing as Ben Mears, the protagonist but you are no David Soul ..don't give up on us baby, don't make the wrong seem right, the future isn't just one night, its written in the moonlight, painted on the stars, we can't change ours .....ooohhh laa la la la la la la so don't give up on us i know, we can still come through...Sorry for getting carried away a little bit there but watching this movie makes you wonder why evil make us do things we normally don't do...tempation you say? that's it as sin will doom us all if we continue to allow temptation to get the better of us. Then again, this movie is no different from the town that we live in...just look around with open eyes and you will clearly see what i am talking about. Just make sure you lock your doors before you go to sleep.If your into scary vamprye movies or have read the noval, you might want to check out this installment of Salem's lot but don't be surprise if you are lost from the very start, as was I. Just be prepared to be scared for weeks after you watch it. Thanks alot guys...like i really need this now!",3,Vampyres in our very town if we look around....,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,2467,"['very', 'long', 'movie', 'confusion', 'written', 'due', 'shifting', 'time', 'present', 'past', 'now', 'where', 'have', 'i', 'seen', 'know', 'i', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Stephen', 'King', 'noval', 'yet', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'early', 'confusion', 'come', 'give', 'hints', 'man', '.i', 'know', 'narration', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'one', 'bit', 'little', 'subplots', 'going', 'main', 'plot', 'wonder', 'When', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'took', 'dare', 'house', 'witness', 'something', 'change', 'life', 'forever', 'back', 'years', 'later', 'see', 'throw', 'Priest', 'out', 'window', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'working', 'Thanksgiving', 'day', 'giving', 'out', 'food', 'homeless', 'hungry', 'Did', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'what', 'happen', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'Watch', 'see', 'o', 'will', 'admit', 'even', 'tho', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'confused', 'very', 'start', 'watching', 'movie', 'things', 'happening', 'so', 'fast', 'many', 'characters', 'town', 'u', 'get', 'sense', 'director', 'losing', 'direction', 'work', 'well', 'suspense', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'scary', 'weird', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'one', 'bit', 'alot', 'too', 'especially', 'i', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'crappy', 'vampyre', 'movies', 'including', 'best', 'Blade', 'Interview', 'Vampyre', 'two', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'genre.I', 'say', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'convincing', 'Ben', 'Mears', 'protagonist', 'are', 'David', 'Soul', '..do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'baby', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'wrong', 'seem', 'right', 'future', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'night', 'written', 'moonlight', 'painted', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'ours', '..ooohhh', 'la', 'la', 'la', 'la', 'la', 'la', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'i', 'know', 'can', 'still', 'come', 'Sorry', 'getting', 'carried', 'away', 'little', 'bit', 'watching', 'movie', 'wonder', 'why', 'evil', 'make', 'do', 'things', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'tempation', 'say', 'sin', 'will', 'doom', 'continue', 'allow', 'temptation', 'get', 'better', 'Then', 'again', 'movie', 'different', 'town', 'live', 'just', 'look', 'around', 'open', 'eyes', 'will', 'clearly', 'see', 'what', 'i', 'am', 'talking', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'lock', 'doors', 'go', 'sleep.If', 'scary', 'vamprye', 'movies', 'have', 'read', 'noval', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'installment', 'Salem', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprise', 'are', 'lost', 'very', 'start', 'was', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'scared', 'weeks', 'watch', 'Thanks', 'alot', 'guys', 'i', 'really', 'need', 'now']",Salem's Lot - The Miniseries

Rob Lowe turns in fine acting along with the rest of the cast in the story of a big city writer returning to his roots in the small town of Jerusalem's Lot.  The town, seemingly ordinary in most aspects, is dominated by the ominous looking Marsden House, high on a hill.  The house has been abandoned for twenty-five years, since the owner committed a terrible crime there.  Ben Meers is writing a book on the history of the house, when he finds out it has been bought by mysterious new owners, antique dealers (Donald Sutherland, Rutger Hauer).I was very impressed with this film.  Not to mention it gave me a long and terrifying nightmare.  It has been many years since a movie gave me a nightmare.  Stephen King obviously wrote the character of Ben Meers based on himself.

842722,A2CON4GD056OGB,B0002OXVG4,Louisa the Lemming,"[14, 17]","Well, the film looks professional enough.  It doesn't have low-budget TV movie written all over it.  Also, it does a good job of balancing all the multiple storylines, and weaving a large and diverse cast of townspeople into a coherent plot.  It's well acted, mostly.  I could bitch about Rob Lowe, but I think that would just be mean-spirited scapegoating.  Rob Lowe is fine.But is everything is so well done, why is the film so very boring?  Why don't I LIKE anybody?  Why is watching people die like ticking items off a ""To Do"" list?The film opens with Ben Mears (Rob Lowe), trying to murder a priest, Father Callahan (James Cromwell), in a Detroit food kitchen.  Both end up in an emergency room, where an intern decides to practice his bedside manner on the critically injured Benjamin.  ""Why, as a good Christian shouldn't I let you die?"" jeers this charming fellow.  Mears replies with two words.  ""Jerusalem's Lot"".  Cue to flashback.Ben Mears is a famous author who moves back to his small town home of `Salem's Lot to write a book.  He wants to rent the ""cursed"" Marsten House, but fellow newcomer Mr. Straker (Donald Sutherland) and his Mysterious Unseen Partner snatch it out from under him.  Further misfortunes await Ben, as he is then romantically pursued by one Susan Norton (Samantha Mathis), who has lovely eyes and cheekbones, and a personality cobbled together out of the rejected spare parts of other substandard horror heroines.  Let me give you an idea about Sue. When told in confidence that Ben is writing about the haunted house, she ""accidentally"" lets it slip.  But when she realizes his REAL theme is ""small town evil"", she gets all offended and rats him out ON PURPOSE, turning the whole town against him.  Desperate for further abuse, Ben also befriends his in-your-face ex English teacher Matt (Andre Braugher), who lectures him on his cynicism, and tells him how awful his writing is.Fortunately Ben sticks around anyway, because before you know it, kids start to go missing, people start dying of ""pernicious anemia"", and Ben suspects the House and its new occupants have something to do with it.  Which, of course, it does.  We can tell because every time anyone goes there, the camera starts sneaking up on them for no good reason, and the soundtrack makes lots of whooshing and chanting noises.  This is not scary, but it does explain why the place was so hard to rent.This film has Something to Say.  To do so, it draws Metaphors between human corruption and supernatural evil, and points out these Metaphors in excruciating voice-overs and forced dialogue, just to be sure we catch on.  To further this Important Metaphor, it seems EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the whole town has to be corrupt.  The ""bachelor"" schoolteacher has a secret life in Portland.  The priest drinks.  The doctor is a self-indulgent materialist who is having an affair with an slutty teenager whose husband is a child-abusing blackmailer.  The crooked real-estate agent molests his daughter.  Mark Petrie is a delinquent, Mrs. Glick is a snob, and Ben's landlady used to dabble in black magic and sexual perversion.  I could go on.There is some good stuff in this movie, when it relaxes and remembers it's a VAMPIRE FLICK.  I liked the cop's understated horror at a certain revelation.  I liked the way half the characters proceed on the assumption that there are vampires without truly believing in them, while others who don't consciously believe in vampires at all behave as though they did.  When one of the few likeable characters turns into a violent jerk who covers up obsessively in the daylight, we get a brief touch of the pathos and creepiness which is otherwise missing from this version.But mostly, the film lacks life.  Humanity and warmth seem conspicuously - even intentionally - lacking.  The changes to the framing device, and to Father Callahan, are particularly glaring examples of a general attempt to leech human decency and affection from the story in favor of misanthropic bleakness.  One thing the first miniseries managed to do was make me empathize with Mears before I knew anything about him, simply by allowing me to vicariously experience his fascination and his fear.  But here the film stands in judgment of the characters and the town, while at the same time judging the hero for being judgmental.  This makes it hard to empathize with anyone.There is one scary moment in the whole movie.  ONE.  And it does not involve vampires.  Any vampire that shows up, the first thing he does is move around at super-speed, just to show that he can, which immediately kills the mood.Regarding the spiritual themes of the story: The premise from Stephen King's novel is that vampirism arises from Real Evil.  This implies that there is such a thing as Real Good, which is why crosses work.  In the 1979 movie, the heroes' mad scramble for crucifixes and rosary beads, even though nobody seemed to be Catholic, was funny and kind of endearing.  And it saved the movie from any implication of preaching or pretentiousness.  Alas, this remake is nothing if not pretentious.  If the screenwriter can possibly contrive it, showdowns with vampires are also showdowns with One's Own Sins.  Gay teacher Matt Burke rejects the sexual overtures of the vampire youth he once lusted after, driving him off with prayer alone.  The materialistic doctor sacrifices his BMW to save a child.  As for poor Ben Mears, his sins and psychology take up half the script.  Neither the living nor the dead can shut up about them.  ""I know where you're going with this"" Mears complains, when the vampire he's about to stake regales him with a litany of his faults.  Sure enough, the vamp asserts that since Mears uses other people as fodder for his writing, this makes him . . . the real vampire.  But Mears is too smart to fall for this.  ""I'm NOT the vampire,"" he retorts.  ""Not ANYMORE!""  Oh, please!The same vamp also gives Father Callahan some incoherent psychoanalysis involving his faith and his drinking problem.  Which just goes to prove that Callahan's remarks from earlier in the film were incorrect.  Sure vampires are proven to be a Real Evil rather than figments of our Repressed Subconscious, but it doesn't change anything.  Freud is NOT dead, and he still gets to spoil all the fun.",2,Not Scary.

842724,A1YHHM3QFKCBCK,B0002OXVG4,M2,"[14, 18]","Since the television remake of ""The Shining"" largely got it right, over the lame Kubrick feature version, and ""The Stand"" miniseries was for the most part successful, it must have sounded like a good idea to redo ""Salem's Lot"" as another miniseries (the first one aired in 1979 and was very good).  Unfortunately, this version of Stephen King's vampire tale is a total loss in every department, from casting (though I suppose the production team should get points for casting in the lead Rob Lowe, the only actor on earth blander than the original's David Soul), to scripting (the pause for dialogue between the hero, stake-in-hand, and the vampire he's about to kill, is mind-numbingly dumb), to set design (the interior of the haunted Marsten House is so ridiculously ""creepy"" that it's laughable).  The usually reliable Donald Sutherland is way, way over the top as the sinister advance man for the vampire Barlow, and the not always reliable Rutger Hauer (as Barlow) blows a good opportunity to erase the memory of horrifying-in-the-extreme Reggie Nalder from the original.  And while Andre Braugher is a fine actor, and he tries to generate some interest in his role as the ex-teacher of Lowe, he's about twenty years too young for the role, which gives the entire proceedings a kind of college theatre artificiality.

842725,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0002OXVG4,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[5, 6]","This adaptation of excellent Stephen King's book is mostly a failure and it is definitely inferior to the 1979 version.It's a pity, because the casting is rather impressive. Rob Lowe as Ben Mears, Donald Sutherland as Straker, Rutger Hauer as Barlow and James Cromwell as Father Callahan - all are excellent actors, but here their talents are wasted.So what went wrong? The biggest weakness of the film is the number of differences with the book, some of which change COMPLETELY the personality and the destiny of many important characters. It is always a risky thing to correct works of a great master although it is not exactly forbidden - but, as they say, if you take a shot at the King (sorry, I couldn't resist) you better not miss. Well, here, all the shots missed...The character of Ben Mears, the main hero, was messed up. Instead of a writer, he is an investigative journalist, who wrote a book about some ugly incidents during war in Afghanistan - and for that reason some ""rednecks"" in Salem's Lot resent him... It ultimately doesn't have any more consequences, but it gives the director the occasion to say ""Hey, did you see it? I am against the war and I said it in my film!""A more serious difference is in Ben's background, in everything which concerns his relation to the Marsten House - but here I can not say more, except that I found this new thing completely unnecessary.The character of Matt Burke was changed from white to black, which is finally not so important - but what is already more serious, is that this old teacher was also changed from straight to closeted gay, secretely obsessing on his young pupils... As not such thing figured in King's book, I found this change a really bad idea.Young Mark Petrie was in the book a very clever and precociously adult young boy, who forced respect by standing up to the schoolyard bullys - in this version he is a kind of a young delinquent and a bully himself!Susan Norton was a delicious, brilliant, ambitious and educated young girl in the book - here she is already a woman in her 30s, working as a barmaid. Which is more, Samantha Mathis was clearly an error in the casting as she plays with all the talent of a block of timber and she clearly doesn't give two hoots about this role, this film or anything else for that matter. And which is even worse, her character was made in a total idiot!Donald Sutherland was a great choice to play Straker, the somehow creepy aged antiquarian, but this character was also changed - rather than a distant, arrogant and a little bit scary but always well mannered British gentleman, here he is an extraverted crazy weirdo, wagging his tongue at people and whispering dirty things to the ears of old ladies...Dr Cody was in the book a young, happy, brilliant, optimistic and generous doctor who still believed that his mission was to save the world rather than enjoy the life and get rich - here he is a moron who can not keep it in his pants and sleeps with his patients...Lawrence Crockett was in the book a weasely but very clever real estate agent, who made a fortune out of nothing, who was feared but also respected in the town and also a rather good husband and a doting father, spoiling silly his only child - here he is a slimy creep and a pedophile, who regularly rapes his daughter...But the WORSE thing was made to Father Callahan, who is such a complex, tragic and important character not only in ""Salem's Lot"" but also in some of the much later Stephen King's books belonging to the ""Dark Tower"" cycle. I can not really get into details to avoid spoilers, but the changes made in this version completely RUINED this whole character. My only guess is that the director simply couldn't resist the pleasure of some Catholic bashing, which seems to be presently the last still respectable form of bigotry...And finally, there is one more change, concerning the city of Salem's Lot as a whole. In the book, Stephen King described the life in a little provincial town with realism, digging without mercy into some of the dirty little (and not so little) secrets, but as a whole his vision was one of comprehension, teinted with some humour. In this adaptation, Ben Mears who is the narrator, describes the town and its inhabitants with deep contempt and in some moments with real hatred. And in fact towards the end it seems that Salem's Lot was not the victim of an evil monster but was simply punished for the deadly and ugly sin of being a small town populated by simple people who just wanted to live their lives and be left in peace... This contempt towards Salem's Lot inhabitants (absent from the book), which appears in the fullest in the scene when a group of ""vampirised"" townspeople gather in the dump and eat garbage, completely changes the whole sense of the story.And finally, there is the ending which is COMPLETELY different from the one in the book and which is probably one of the most ludicrous things I ever saw on TV...For all those reasons, I personally found this adaptation very, very disappointing and I advise against buying it. It is more reasonable to rent it or even look it up on ""you.tube"", because otherwise it would be a waste of money and shelf space.",1,"A failed remake of 1979 version, with the original story

It wasn't because the film evoked the same sense of wonder and dread that the novel did.  Far from it, this was because the ""adaptation"" took obscene liberties with the plot...introducing idiotic new wrinkles to the characters, shifting emphasis from the ones that were lead characters in the book to the bit players, and introducing an ending totally different than the one in the book.  I find myself wondering if Stephen King was happy with the end product (if so, he needs to have his head examined because the the original filming of ""Salem's Lot"" with all its faults was far superior).  Consider:&lt;spoilers>1.  Why did they make Matt Burke gay?  And imbue his encounter with the undead Michael Ryerson with homosexual overtones instead of the ones of pure horror that the book had?  I've got no problems with casting Andre Braugher as Burke (Matt in the book was a WASP)...he's a great actor but why throw in an angle like that?2.  Why did they feel the need to make Father Callahan not just a rather tragic figure whose faith failed him at a crucial moment but instead into a surprise villain who spouts racist insults when he murders Matt Burke (who died of a heart attack in the novel)?3.  Why did the minseries depict Lawrence Crockett as a man molesting his own daughter?4.  Why was it necessary to depict Dr. Jimmy Cody as a man carrying on an affair with one of his patients?5.  Why did the vampires in the miniseries suddenly shift from being vampires to being cannibalistic zombies at the end?6.  Why was it necessary to change the ending from one where Mark and Ben returned to the Lot determined to eliminate all the vampires to one where Ben and the fallen priest have a confrontation in some city where both of them eventually wind up dead?&lt;end spoilers>I just don't get why there was a need to make these and so many other changes.  Some of them don't matter or even make sense since as some people reviewing the series have pointed out, King wrote Salem's Lot in the early 1970s where things like the Internet, cell phones, and al-Qa'ida didn't exist and some updating makes some sense.  But this is more than updating or tweaking a story.  It's a defilement as grotesque as the one in the book where Barlow forces Father Callahan to drink his tainted blood.

I've also seen some chapters of 1979's miniseries.Now I was able to see this new version of King's novel and must say I love it, even with some annoying changes introduced in the story by Filardi's script.The story took vampires myth and situated it not in a far land, not far in the past, but in our time in a little Maine's town.One of the novel important traits is preserved in the film: the ins and outs of a small village. In Spanish we have a saying: ""Small town, big inferno"" and that's exactly what happens in Salem's Lot. Infidelity, jealousy, envy, alcoholism, domestic violence and authoritarianism crisscross relationships.Horror starts to creep little by little, trapping first one, then another folk, putting the village under siege. Evil take advantage of small human failures, exploit them till they grow to be unbearable, leaving ordinary mortals at its disposition.A small heterogeneous group tries to combat evil with all their strength. Here the characters resort to other human values: solidarity, self-sacrifice, braveness, altruism amongst other.The film portrays this titanic struggle till its bitter end!Playacting is quite good. Donald Sutherland and Rutger Hauer as ""the big bad boys"" are great. Rob Lowe as the novelist Ben Mears is very solid and convincing. The rest of the cast is accurate in their characterizations.The miniseries format allows many different types of good and evil neighbors to be shown without detracting attention from the main characters.It is a good film for lovers of the genre!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",4,You Must Never Let a Neighbor Invite a Vampire!,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,1643,"['Salem', 'Lot', 'second', 'novel', 'written', 'Stephen', 'King', 'have', 'read', 'reviewed', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'chapters', '1979', 'miniseries.Now', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'new', 'version', 'King', 'novel', 'must', 'say', 'love', 'even', 'annoying', 'changes', 'introduced', 'story', 'Filardi', 'script.The', 'story', 'took', 'vampires', 'myth', 'situated', 'not', 'far', 'land', 'not', 'far', 'past', 'time', 'little', 'Maine', 'town.One', 'novel', 'important', 'traits', 'preserved', 'film', 'ins', 'outs', 'small', 'village', 'Spanish', 'have', 'saying', 'Small', 'town', 'big', 'inferno', 'exactly', 'what', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'Infidelity', 'jealousy', 'envy', 'alcoholism', 'domestic', 'violence', 'authoritarianism', 'crisscross', 'relationships.Horror', 'creep', 'little', 'little', 'trapping', 'first', 'one', 'then', 'folk', 'putting', 'village', 'siege', 'Evil', 'take', 'advantage', 'small', 'human', 'failures', 'exploit', 'grow', 'be', 'unbearable', 'leaving', 'ordinary', 'mortals', 'disposition.A', 'small', 'heterogeneous', 'group', 'combat', 'evil', 'strength', 'Here', 'characters', 'resort', 'other', 'human', 'values', 'solidarity', 'self-sacrifice', 'braveness', 'altruism', 'amongst', 'other.The', 'film', 'portrays', 'titanic', 'struggle', 'till', 'bitter', 'end', 'Playacting', 'quite', 'good', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'big', 'bad', 'boys', 'are', 'great', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'novelist', 'Ben', 'Mears', 'very', 'solid', 'convincing', 'rest', 'cast', 'accurate', 'characterizations.The', 'miniseries', 'format', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'good', 'evil', 'neighbors', 'be', 'shown', 'detracting', 'attention', 'main', 'characters.It', 'good', 'film', 'lovers', 'genre', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",Salem's Lot - The Miniseries

I do give credit to this made for TV effort for many reasons:  it does follow the basic premise of the novel, and it has some interesting camerawork and a few good performances.  Can one imagine this movie with an actor like Tom Hanks playing Ben Mears?  Rob Lowe does a commendable job, but he comes across as so self-absorbed, and the depth of his persona is never fully realized.  Samantha Mathis does a credible job as Susan Norton, but she too comes across self-centered and judgmental.  Donald Sutherland and Rutger Hauer camp it up and are effective, but they never seem truly evil.  James Cromwell succumbs too quickly to Hauer's influence, and even Daniel Byrd as young Mark Petrie doesn't seem to see beyond his own feelings.  Some of the lesser known Australian actors fare better:  the town's sheriff; the lovely Eva, the landlady at the boarding house; the seductive Sandy McDougall; and even the town retarded man, Dud.  Andre Braugher tries to be Denzel Washington, but this talented actor is miscast in the role, and tying him to a hospital bed for the majority of his role hinders his performance.

At least this time around I managed to stay awake for the duration of the film, or wasn't reaching for the remote all the time to fast-forward through boring and useless dialog. I suppose if you where around to see the original films release, you may have felt like you where seeing something chilling come to life from a Stephen King book, but in today's society, those of you who enjoy a slow paced movie are outnumbered... and that's why this film was remade, and now, it's watchable from start to finish.Unlike the original, I figured out what the movie was about and where it was heading fairly quickly, and could follow it the rest of the way to the end. Rob Lowe plays a writer who has come back to town, and has brought his haunting memories of when he was a child and snuck into a spooky old house and witnessed something chilling enough to haunt him for years.

842736,AP9LTXNHPI42F,B0002OXVG4,NorthernBelle,"[2, 6]","This is the movie that the original should have been. It is superior in every way including the cast, the acting, the screenplay, the score, the character development, and the cinematography. The original pales by comparison. The mini-series is also more true to the book; this is not necessary a good thing when it comes to adapting Stephen King's novels to the screen, but in this case it is.This is a modern-day adaptation that works. In his books SK takes myths and legends and adapts them to our times. If SK had written this book in 2004, his characters would have been using cellphones and the internet. So why shouldn't they here?Who cares if we don't see Ben Mears at his typewriter? Like all SK books this is a long story and the producers had to pick what to include and what not to. Otherwise, this movie would have been criticised for being bloated, boring, and too long. They chose well. I have watched this movie at least 20 times and I am still seeing new things.All of the characters in this film are more believable than those in the original. David Soul just wasn't convincing. I couldn't buy that he cared about the Marsten House. Not so with Rob Lowe. Rob Lowe's narration from his hospital bed, with flashbacks to him there, works well. ""Hail Mary full of grace, help me win this stock car race..."" Rob Lowe's Ben Mears is sympathetic.Where were Dud Rodgers and Ruth Crocket, the school bus driver, or Sandy and Royce McDougall and their baby in the original? These are high-profile characters in the book that were important to the story yet were completely omitted in the 1979 version.In addition to being better-developed, nearly all of the characters in the mini-series are more likeable and dignified. The boarding house woman in the original looks like a barfly and the sheriff comes across as a dumb country bumpkin. The teacher in the original was just a frail old man with gray hair who had little to offer.This film's Barlow is also better, much more convincing than that 10-foot tall space alien thing in the original which was laughable.This movie has some truly macabre and scary moments. The vampire that slithered through a narrow vent to reach his victim, breaking his bones in the process. The creatures who climbed walls and crawled upside-down on ceilings. Ben Mears' encounter with Susan at the end of the movie--this last part was left out entirely from the original except for a split second when David Soul turned to the house before setting it on fire and said, ""Sorry Susan."" That can't compare to the encounter between this Ben Mears and Susan Norton at the end of this movie--it is beautiful and heartbreaking. Dud Rodgers' isolation and destitution in the junkyard at night, making him vulnerable to the monster. Matt Burke's reaction when he walks into his upstairs room and sees Mike Ryerson standing in front of him--the acting is brilliant, I have never seen shock and horror conveyed so well by any actor. Ben Mears' confrontation with Barlow at the end when Barlow taunts him and Ben drives the stake through Barlow, destroying both the monster as well as the vampire within himself.My only criticism of the movie is at the very end when it looks like Michael Jackson's Thriller video with the monster mob shuffling through the streets. That scene should have been left out, but that is a minor thing.This is not the best horror movie I have ever seen and it may not even be the best SK mini-series that has ever been made, but it comes close.

The supporting characters are also cast well, and that is important as this movie depends a lot on them.  Unlike many of todays movies and books, this story does not only focus on the protagonist, it also follows the lives (and deaths) of the lesser characters.  We come to know their struggles, how they feel about certain things, and their relationships.The vampires in this movie are clearly no Lestat's.  They are monsters, who are simply out for blood.  There is no romantic quality to them, and they appear to look more like zombies at certain points than vampires, which works for the movie.Now, onto the complaints.  The characters should have been more freaked out!  There wasn't much reluctance in certain characters to believe that vampires were taking over the town, and even less reluctance to rely on the legendary means of killing a vampire.  And, there is also one big hole in the plot.  This movie clearly follows the legend that vampires cannot enter a home unless invited--that actually plays a MAJOR part in the movie.  However, in one scene, Barlow (a vampire) breaks into a woman's house through the window and kills her!

842740,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0002OXVG4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[14, 17]","(note: seven hundred words cut for length limitations.)'Salem's Lot (Mikael Salomon, 2004)Mikael Salomon was responsible for Aftershock (the New York City earthquake movie) and the TV adaptation of Dean Koontz' Sole Survivors. Do you need to know anything else? I will note for the record at the very beginning that this review does contain a number of spoilers for those who have neither read the novel nor seen the original 1979 screen adaptation. If you have experienced neither, I urge you to go out and do so immediately, before wasting a single minute on this piece of horse hockey.It certainly starts off well enough. One of the first things of which we are made aware is that Dud Rogers, whose part was cut for the original adaptation, is back. This, however, should probably be popping up a small red flag in your head. If Salomon is bringing back minor characters, and this version is exactly as long as the previous version... what all is he going to cut out? Answer: way, way too much.This adaptation of 'Salem's Lot suffers from an odd form of multiple personality disorder; in order to understand a single thing about what's going on, you have to have read the novel However, for a miniseries that requires viewers to have read the book, Salomon tried getting away with making huge, sweeping changes in the motivations of every character. Ben Mears is still back in town writing a book, but the nature of the book has changed. Ben has also gone from being an obscure literary author whose works are castigated in his hometown for their obscenity to being a Pulitzer-prizewinning author of nonfiction whose books are castigated for being liberal, which is completely gratuitous. Susan Norton and Ben still have chemistry, but the storybook affair has been trashed, thus making the Ben-and-Susan confrontation (which, for the second time, is handled completely differently than it is in the book) ring completely false. Mark Petrie has turned from an earnest believer in monsters into an obnoxious little jerk whose main goal in life seems to be to make trouble for everyone around him. He also no longer has a father, not that his father was a major character (but it smacks of new-age pop psychology-- ""I'm an obnoxious little jerk because I have no father""). Mark and the Glick brothers are much older, thus robbing the Ralphie Glick scenes of their built-in creepiness, and their mother is now a wealthy, thoroughly unlikable socialite (you can imagine what that takes away from her resurrection scene, one of the best pieces of the original adaptation). While a number of minor characters cut out of the novel in the 1979 adaptation return, one gets the feeling they returned simply to cater to those who thought the 1979 adaptation wasn't any good because it wasn't the book. Dud, the bus driver, Larry Crockett's daughter, and a number of others return, but their sole goal in being in the film is ""we're here to become vampires."" They are completely robbed of any of the characterization, emotional value, or complexity they have in the novel. Not exactly the best trade-off on the planet.As well, the initial pace is increased here, but the sole reason for that seems to be to give extra time to killing off the ""kill me"" characters. It's as if some idiot studio exec is sitting in a big office saying ""if you film the opening scenes at the pace they are in the book, everyone will be too bored to watch after fifteen minutes."" Which is too bad, because it's obvious 'Salem's Lot needs at least eight, maybe twelve, hours for a comprehensive treatment. Get over it; 'Salem's Lot is not just about vampires. In fact, the vampires are really a minor concern (don't want to use the term ""allegory"" around a studio exec. They get testy when confronted with words of more than one syllable).What is it that makes minor characters minor? Why is the Ben and Susan relationship so much more important (in the original, anyway; it's given the shortest of shrifts here) than Dud and Ruth? It's a simple answer, really, and opens the door to the main reason people outside Hollywood look at Hollywood films and scoff. For lack of a better way of putting it, I call it ""emotional shortcuts."" Emotional shortcuts are little tricks: when you see action X, you know the characters are feeling Y. They're cliches that are tacitly accepted in the film industry. They are another way of making movies safe; you know that when such things come up, you don't have to think about what they mean; you have seen them so many times, you already know. It's lazy in screenwriter, director, and viewer to accept such things with open arms. Unfortunately, Salomon and screenwriter Peter Filardi have stocked the miniseries chock full of emotional shortcuts; watch the first confrontation between Larry and Dud, while Ruth, torn with longing, approaches and backs away from her bedroom window repeatedly. There's not a shred of real emotion in the scene; it's all done via shortcut. The end result is that the characters may look like they have a surface complexity, when in fact they're still cardboard cutouts capable of blowing over at the first hard wind. Unfortunately, most of them are also windbags.To put the last little crowning glory on the pain that this causes, Ed ""Weasel"" Phillips' character is listed in the credits as ""Ed Weasel.""And the worst part is, I haven't hit all the bad points.

This remake does follow the book more closely in some respects, like bringing other characters to life and showing more of the history of Ben Mears (Lowe). However, the villains Straker (Sutherland)and Barlow (Haugher) aren't seen enough and too many details were either ignored or changed. The 1979 original featuring James Mason(Straker)and David Soul (Mears)seemed scarier and easier to follow. Perhaps the DVD release of this new remake will be easier to hear as well, the TV release was difficult to understand.One note of Donald Sutherland's portayal of Straker, he was brilliant, should have seen more of him.

842745,A2TORR6E4EUCAF,B0002OXVG4,Severen,"[100, 121]","***Warning: Spoilers Ahead***I've always loved the novel and the 1979 miniseries. When I heard they were doing a remake in 2004, I couldn't wait! Then I found out Rob Lowe was starring. Eeeh, he was in ""The Stand"" a decade earlier and that managed not to suck. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt and tuned in. And in all fairness to Rob Lowe he can hardly be blamed for how awful it turned out.Now I can understand changing around elements for ""dramatic purposes"" and ""updating"" and ""adapting for television"". Let's not forget the novel was written and published in the 1970's when there were no cellphones, laptop computers or Internet. It seems the fellow who adapted the novel, Peter Filardi, and went hog-wild with it. The end result is that the only the movie characters have in common with their book counterparts are the names. Ben Mears was once held captive by the Taliban? Matt Burke is gay? Susan Norton is a waitress? Did Filardi even read the novel? Then there is the problem of the very minor characters getting way, way, waaayyyy more screen time than they deserve, as in they shouldn't have been in the movie at all. Sandy McDougall, Dud Rogers, Charlie Rhodes and Ruthie Crockett are all very minor throw-away characters who don't deserve a place in the movie. Ruthie didn't even have any dialogue in the book for crying out loud!!! What is so special about these characters that they managed to get on screen and take away precious time from the real characters? This is reason why Barlow is reduced to a cameo, because Peter Filardi felt the inexplicable need to cram in as many characters as possible.My biggest complaint is the way they handled the scene where a vampire Mike Ryerson comes back to Matt Burke's house. Instead of being a terrifying encounter with the undead it winds up a truly bizarre homo-erotic/necrophiliac encounter so completely drained of any suspense that left me scratching my head and wondering 'what the hell was that about'? Hey people, if it ain't broke don't fix it! If you had $25 million to spend on this movie why didn't you hire a writer who could actually write a suspenseful scene!! Stephen King should sue!

I watched this film for over 3 or 4 times and know what I'm talking about - I find absolutely nothing wrong with it. Maybe 10 years from now there'll be need to remake Salem's Lot but until then at least let's give this series a chance.When I say you should feel ashamed I do not mean I am attacking you personally - what I mean is that this TV series is simply brilliant and those of us who know are all in agreement on that.This TV series is in fact a whole movie that's on a single DVD and it's an awsome film. It'also a return to the vampire who couldn't tolerate crosses in the cinema of the 50's , 60's and 70's , 40's , 30's and even 20's.If you're gonna remake a film like for instance Vamphyr , I wouldn't be surprised to look at disappointments. But I won't even give myself time to view the reviews of the one starers. By that I don't mean they don't know what they're talking about - all I mean is that those are their views , and my view is my view. And when I state that my view is that the majority of them should feel ashamed , they'll at least try to put themselves into the shoes of the geniuses behind the production of the series. At first I wasn't sure if I was gonna like the TV series or movie or not , but the 180 minutes made me feel as if I had been watching it for shorter time than the old film.And it's a different atmosphere now , literally when it comes to old movies. Look at how different the atmosphere is then and compare it to what it's like in films that are being produced today. The sky tells us a lot in these films. The vampires are sinister and old - modern. I think that there may be fans of this movie in even the communities of real life vampires. After I watched the film I bought a new version of Salem's Lot which I still keep at home. And I say bravo! This movie is an absolute masterwork in movie remaking. This is a brilliant example in a sucession to remaking and I hope that my comment will not inspire the producers to create worse remakes of other movie projects in the future.Sometimes when too many people give a movie director's film project similarly sounding positive criticism reviews , the result may be that a future film project becomes not as sucessful because the director was not as serious when he had been focused on that film. So maybe a lot of negative criticism spiced with a few positive ones didn't do any damage.This series is also in my view far less formula - based than the old Salem's Lot which is equally brilliantly directed. But what the negative reviewers and we positive reviewers on Salem's Lot TV series or film can agree upon , is that the good ol's Salem's Lot will never be remade in the fashion it originally appeared when it was first released in cinemas.This is a series or film I keep reliving and enjoying each time I watch it.I strongly encourage newcomers to the world of Salem's Lot and the world of these two films not to take my positive criticism seriously but to form their own judgement after they've seen these films and compared them with each other. There was also a relatively unknown Salem's Lot TV miniseries released before this one was made , and then there was a Salem's Lot 2 which was supposed to be a sequel to the original Salem's Lot , and incredibly I've actually seen Salem's Lot 2!!",5,Salems Lot and Salem's Lot - for the love of both of them,1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,3614,"['one', 'starers', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'Tv', 'miniseries', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'one', 'star', 'views.The', 'reason', 'why', 'simply', 'miniseries', 'version', 'designed', 'capture', 'spirit', 'modern', 'times', 'put', 'context', 'aligning', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Salem', 'Lot.And', 'doing', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'think', 'watched', 'film', '3', '4', 'times', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'find', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Maybe', '10', 'years', 'now', ""'ll"", 'be', 'need', 'remake', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'then', 'least', 'let', 'give', 'series', 'chance.When', 'say', 'should', 'feel', 'ashamed', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'am', 'attacking', 'personally', 'what', 'mean', 'TV', 'series', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'who', 'know', 'are', 'agreement', 'that.This', 'TV', 'series', 'fact', 'whole', 'movie', 'single', 'DVD', 'awsome', 'film', ""It'also"", 'return', 'vampire', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'tolerate', 'crosses', 'cinema', '50', '60', '70', '40', '30', 'even', ""20's.If"", ""'re"", 'gon', 'remake', 'film', 'instance', 'Vamphyr', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'look', 'disappointments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'time', 'view', 'reviews', 'one', 'starers', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'mean', 'are', 'views', 'view', 'view', 'when', 'state', 'view', 'majority', 'should', 'feel', 'ashamed', ""'ll"", 'least', 'try', 'put', 'shoes', 'geniuses', 'production', 'series', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'gon', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'not', '180', 'minutes', 'made', 'feel', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'shorter', 'time', 'old', 'film.And', 'different', 'atmosphere', 'now', 'literally', 'when', 'old', 'movies', 'Look', 'how', 'different', 'atmosphere', 'then', 'compare', 'what', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'produced', 'today', 'sky', 'lot', 'films', 'vampires', 'are', 'sinister', 'old', 'modern', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'fans', 'movie', 'even', 'communities', 'real', 'life', 'vampires', 'watched', 'film', 'bought', 'new', 'version', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'still', 'keep', 'home', 'say', 'bravo', 'movie', 'absolute', 'masterwork', 'movie', 'remaking', 'brilliant', 'example', 'sucession', 'remaking', 'hope', 'comment', 'will', 'not', 'inspire', 'producers', 'create', 'worse', 'remakes', 'other', 'movie', 'projects', 'future.Sometimes', 'when', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'give', 'movie', 'director', 'film', 'project', 'similarly', 'sounding', 'positive', 'criticism', 'reviews', 'result', 'may', 'be', 'future', 'film', 'project', 'not', 'as', 'sucessful', 'director', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'serious', 'when', 'had', 'been', 'focused', 'film', 'So', 'maybe', 'lot', 'negative', 'criticism', 'spiced', 'few', 'positive', 'ones', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'damage.This', 'series', 'also', 'view', 'far', 'less', 'formula', 'based', 'old', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'equally', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'what', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'positive', 'reviewers', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'TV', 'series', 'film', 'can', 'agree', 'good', 'ol', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'remade', 'fashion', 'originally', 'appeared', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'cinemas.This', 'series', 'film', 'keep', 'reliving', 'enjoying', 'time', 'watch', 'it.I', 'strongly', 'encourage', 'newcomers', 'world', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'world', 'two', 'films', 'not', 'take', 'positive', 'criticism', 'seriously', 'form', 'own', 'judgement', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'compared', 'other', 'was', 'also', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'released', 'one', 'was', 'made', 'then', 'was', 'Salem', 'Lot', '2', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sequel', 'original', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'incredibly', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'seen', 'Salem', 'Lot', '2']",Salem's Lot - The Miniseries

Neither movie did a great job of really capturing the terror of the book but I think the original was a bit better.  It just seemed a bit creepier and darker.I think most of the leads of the orginal did a better job including James Mason as the vampire servent Straker, who just emitted more evil than the tired Donald Sutherland.  Add to that I preferred the nosferatu looking vampire as opposed to the more normal looking Rutger Hauer as Barlow.

842753,A3DKB9QZUJYBE3,B0002OXVG4,"Trixie ""cupcakejones""","[21, 24]","Stephen King has not been treated kindly by the movies. For years, his books were turned into films. Most of them bad. None of them on par with the books. This has been remedied in the past few years by the television miniseries, the only format that can do King justice. For while he may be a horror writer,  it's King's gift for prose and characterization that makes him shine above others in the genre. The Shining and especially The Stand fared well as miniseries. Now Salem's Lot has been remade. The Tobe Hooper version (also made for TV) was flawed in that it made some unwise changes to the book and had a silly ending but it was genuinely scary. And to that end, this remake largely falls short.(This review is written from the perspective of someone who has read the book and I assume most viewers will have read it or are familiar with it.)I don't know why every writer who takes a crack at King has to change plot and character needlessly but it seems they do. This version has far too much setup before anything really happens. Some of the good stuff includes an updated backstory for Ben Mears and a much more sinister history for him with the Marsten house (in this version, he actually witnesses the suicide death of Hubie Marsten instead of only imagining it years later.) This version also includes Dr. Jim Cody and Father Callahan-one of whom was eliminated from the original and the other serving a much truncated role. The Barlow character is also a full-fledged one instead of a speechless Nosferatu that relied on the Straker character (played in the original by James Mason) for a voice and personality.Alas most of the new material is unnecessary padding and I was largely bored by the first half. For example, a new story line about Dr. Cody having an affair with a patient and getting blackmailed that was not in the book and totally unnecessary.  These revisions on the original become particularly annoying when some of the best moments from the book are left out later on or not fully explained. One of the creepiest moments in the novel was when the team breaks into the Marsten House only to find Barlow had already relocated and left them a letter correctly guessing and urbanely threatening each team member. That was completely omitted. They do add a nice touch though with the subsequent discovery of Susan there that I won't reveal.By failing to stick to the book and venturing out on his own, the screenwriter (Peter Filardi) also introduces a number of noticeable logic gaps. The characters make a point of saying vampires can't enter a home unless they are invited only to have Barlow later do just that without explanation. Later, after their leader is killed the vampires all seem to turn into zombies with one significant exception. While this made for a poignant interaction between two main characters, it made no sense. Certainly many horror films have idiosyncracies and you the viewer must at a certain point just let go and enjoy but the material must rise above them to make this possible.  This miniseries was also filmed in Australia and it's evident from the accents of the minor characters that something is amiss as their ill-fitting American accents occassionally slide all over the map. At one point, I wondered if one character had been changed to an Eastern European only to have her accent wander back to New England a few sentences later.As for the cast, Donald Sutherland is brilliant in an over-the-top performance as the fey yet ominous Straker. He is easily the best part of the movie. Rob Lowe fares well as Ben Mears and Andre Braugher adds gravitas as Matt Burke. I also liked Samantha Mathis-where has she been hiding?-as Susan Norton and Dan Byrd as Mark Petrie, in a role that is closer to the book than the original film. Rutger Hauer was miscast, however, as Barlow in my opinion and as this is such an important part it's yet another flaw that fatally affects the movie. Overall, the second half somewhat redeems the first but this book is still waiting for better treatment.(This DVD is well-made but contains no extras. Some deleted scenes might go a long ways toward rectifying the plot gaps but as it is the mystery of why this version had to reinvent a perfectly fine wheel will remain unsolved.)",3,Such potential,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,4275,"['Stephen', 'King', 'not', 'been', 'treated', 'kindly', 'movies', 'years', 'books', 'were', 'turned', 'films', 'Most', 'bad', 'None', 'par', 'books', 'been', 'remedied', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'television', 'miniseries', 'only', 'format', 'can', 'do', 'King', 'justice', 'may', 'be', 'horror', 'writer', 'King', 'gift', 'prose', 'characterization', 'shine', 'others', 'genre', 'Shining', 'especially', 'Stand', 'fared', 'well', 'miniseries', 'Now', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'been', 'remade', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'version', 'also', 'made', 'TV', 'was', 'flawed', 'made', 'unwise', 'changes', 'book', 'had', 'silly', 'ending', 'was', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'end', 'remake', 'largely', 'short', 'review', 'written', 'perspective', 'someone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'assume', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'read', 'are', 'familiar', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'writer', 'who', 'crack', 'King', 'change', 'plot', 'character', 'needlessly', 'do', 'version', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'setup', 'anything', 'really', 'good', 'stuff', 'updated', 'backstory', 'Ben', 'Mears', 'much', 'more', 'sinister', 'history', 'Marsten', 'house', 'version', 'actually', 'suicide', 'death', 'Hubie', 'Marsten', 'instead', 'only', 'imagining', 'years', 'later', 'version', 'also', 'Dr.', 'Jim', 'Cody', 'Father', 'Callahan-one', 'whom', 'was', 'eliminated', 'original', 'other', 'serving', 'much', 'truncated', 'role', 'Barlow', 'character', 'also', 'full-fledged', 'one', 'instead', 'speechless', 'Nosferatu', 'relied', 'Straker', 'character', 'played', 'original', 'James', 'Mason', 'voice', 'most', 'new', 'material', 'unnecessary', 'padding', 'was', 'largely', 'bored', 'first', 'half', 'example', 'new', 'story', 'line', 'Dr.', 'Cody', 'having', 'affair', 'patient', 'getting', 'blackmailed', 'was', 'not', 'book', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'revisions', 'original', 'become', 'particularly', 'annoying', 'when', 'best', 'moments', 'book', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'later', 'not', 'fully', 'explained', 'One', 'creepiest', 'moments', 'novel', 'was', 'when', 'team', 'Marsten', 'House', 'only', 'find', 'Barlow', 'had', 'already', 'relocated', 'left', 'letter', 'correctly', 'guessing', 'urbanely', 'threatening', 'team', 'member', 'was', 'completely', 'omitted', 'do', 'add', 'nice', 'touch', 'subsequent', 'discovery', 'Susan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal.By', 'failing', 'stick', 'book', 'venturing', 'out', 'own', 'screenwriter', 'Peter', 'Filardi', 'also', 'number', 'noticeable', 'logic', 'gaps', 'characters', 'make', 'point', 'saying', 'vampires', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enter', 'home', 'are', 'invited', 'only', 'have', 'Barlow', 'later', 'do', 'just', 'explanation', 'Later', 'leader', 'killed', 'vampires', 'seem', 'turn', 'zombies', 'one', 'significant', 'exception', 'made', 'poignant', 'interaction', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'made', 'sense', 'Certainly', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'idiosyncracies', 'viewer', 'must', 'certain', 'point', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'enjoy', 'material', 'must', 'rise', 'make', 'possible', 'miniseries', 'was', 'also', 'filmed', 'Australia', 'evident', 'accents', 'minor', 'characters', 'something', 'amiss', 'ill-fitting', 'American', 'accents', 'occassionally', 'slide', 'map', 'one', 'point', 'wondered', 'one', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'changed', 'Eastern', 'European', 'only', 'have', 'accent', 'wander', 'back', 'New', 'England', 'few', 'sentences', 'later.As', 'cast', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'brilliant', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'fey', 'yet', 'ominous', 'Straker', 'easily', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'fares', 'well', 'Ben', 'Mears', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'gravitas', 'Matt', 'Burke', 'also', 'liked', 'Samantha', 'Mathis-where', 'been', 'hiding', '-as', 'Susan', 'Norton', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'Mark', 'Petrie', 'role', 'closer', 'book', 'original', 'film', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'was', 'miscast', 'however', 'Barlow', 'opinion', 'such', 'important', 'part', 'yet', 'flaw', 'fatally', 'movie', 'Overall', 'second', 'half', 'somewhat', 'first', 'book', 'still', 'waiting', 'better', 'treatment', 'DVD', 'well-made', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'might', 'go', 'long', 'ways', 'rectifying', 'plot', 'gaps', 'mystery', 'why', 'version', 'had', 'reinvent', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'wheel', 'will', 'remain', 'unsolved']",Salem's Lot - The Miniseries

The budget for the two part miniseries was equal to that of a major motion picture and the look and feel of the film seems like a movie, not a television miniseries. Despite having been published around 25 years ago, the book that the movie is based upon remains one of Stephen King's most popular works.'SALEM'S LOT is King's examination of what would happen if Dracula came to America. Author Ben Mears (Rob Lowe) returns to his hometown of Jerusalem's Lot, commonly known as Salem's Lot, to get some privacy and work on his latest book. Around the same time that Ben returns home, an antique dealer purchases an infamous house on the hill overlooking town for his &#34;employer&#34;. A few days later strange events begin happening. A boy named Danny Glick disappears. A dog is impaled on the fence surrounding the community's graveyard. Danny Glick's body is found but looking not quite like Danny. The events quickly escalate until Ben and a small group of others realize that Dracula is in 'Salem's Lot and if they don't do something fast, no one will escape alive.The movie changes several things from the original novel. However, a movie and a book are not the same things and overall the movie stays true to the spirit of the novel. My only complaint is what ends up happening to Father Callahan. Salem's Lot was one of the few books that Stephen King ever considered writing a sequel to, mostly because of Father Callahan. He later decided against it, but Father Callahan didn't disappear and has a major role to play in the Dark Tower series.There have been a lot of comparisons of this movie with the made-for-tv 1979 version that was directed by Tobe Hooper. There really isn't much of a comparison. The 1979 version gains points for effort, but that's about it. Overall, the 1979 version is a mess of bad acting, bad writing, bad lighting and sets, and cheesy &#34;special effects&#34;. That film does not hold up well and is nowhere near suspenseful, let alone frightening.

842756,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B0002OXVG4,Wayne C. Rogers,"[3, 5]","I remember trying to watch the newer television version of Salem's Lot when it was first on TNT a few years ago, but it just didn't grab me at the time.  I hate watching a mini-series on television that has a ton of commercials.  Also, the little bit that I saw of the show didn't appear to be any more chilling or scary than the original version had been.  For some strange reason, television and Stephen King simply don't mix very well.  Almost everything by King that's been done for television has turned out to be rather mediocre at best.  Some of it has been downright awful.  That's not to say that I don't own the DVDs of The Stand and The Shining and Nightmares & Dreamscapes.  I do.  It's just that I seldom watch them, except for maybe ""Battleground"" in the Nightmares & Dreamscapes series.  That was an EXCELLENT adaptation of a Stephen King story.  The best that's ever been done for television.  I wish the rest of King's stuff that's been done for television was just as good as ""Battleground,"" but it isn't.  Which brings me back to Salem's Lot.  I found a good price on the DVD and decided to give the movie another chance, but without the commercials.  I'm glad I did.  Though the mini-series still had its share of problems, I certainly enjoyed it more this time around.  Rob Lowe takes over the role of Ben Mears from David Soul, playing a writer who returns to his small hometown to write a book about evil and ends up having to fight it tooth and nail.  Rutger Hauer plays the vampire, Barlow, and Donald Sutherland plays his assistant, Straker.  Both of them take over the evil Marsten House that overlooks the town of Jerusalem's Lot, and it isn't long before people start disappearing.  Andre Braugher and Samantha Mathis play Ben's friends and accomplices in fighting the vampires.  James Cromwell plays Father Callahan, the priest who lacks the faith to destroy the evil that's taking over his town.  It's been so long since I read the novel that I unable to tell just how well the newer television version actually holds up.  I will say that it's difficult to find someone to root for.  None of the characters appear to be very likable.  Still, the special effects are well done, and both Sutherland and Hauer steal the show with their over the top performances.  It's easy to see that both men were enjoying themselves and hamming it up to a certain degree.  Rob Lowe does a good job with his character, but David Soul was infinitely a more likable actor in the original series.  I liked it that one of the search dogs in the movie was named Cujo, though he wasn't a St. Bernard.  The movie runs three hours in length, and the last third is by far the best part, though there is one scene in the middle where a vampire in a jail cell squeezes into a tiny air vent in an attempt to get to Lowe, who's in a cell that's further down the corridor.  That was a cool effect!  While not a 5-star film, Salem's Lot is definitely not a 1-star movie, either.  I am happy that I now have it for my ""Stephen King"" film library.  Last, the DVD doesn't have any extras on it.  It would've been nice if there had been an interview with Stephen King and maybe some of the cast and crew, explaining why Salem's Lot was being remade and what they hoped to accomplish with the newer version.

For one thing, the principals are presented as being of less character than in the older version, which takes away from some of the ambience of the movie.  And the monster just doesn't look like a monster.  He looks like a Grand Ole Opery reject.

I remember seeing the David Soul version years ago and being disappointed that it didn't live up to the novel--no easy feat.(Maybe I need to revisit that one.) Anyhow, I thought Rob Lowe did a good job despite my not being a fan of his, as did many of the other actors;Andre Braugher's acting was stellar, although Rutger Hauer as Barlow was too big a leap for me. There are genuinely scary moments in this flick, especially the jail cell scene! Unless there has been some sudden release of superb, hi-brow horror movies on the market that I don't know about, this film well deserves to be on the shelf of every ""spooky"" movie fan.
