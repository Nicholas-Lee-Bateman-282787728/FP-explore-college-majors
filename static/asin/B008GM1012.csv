And this one falls short.  The story line in and of itself, is promising.  A young Yankee widow finds a wounded Confederate soldier in her barn.  The Confederate being an escaped prisoner of war and they eventually fall-in-love.  The main drawback of the film is that they make the mistake of simply taking modern people and putting them in old timey clothing and thinking that is sufficient.  The dialogue is decidedly modern and not at all historical in nature, such as greeting each other with ""Hi!"".  The young girl actor who wear pants throughout the film has very modern looking hair.  And nobody felt ""old timey"" in their acting.  It doesn't work to just put on different clothes and think that is enough.  There is a certain getting into the feel of the historical time period being represented that is called for in a good historical film and it is that element of quality that is lacking in this movie.

1552918,A20TD5PADOEGFE,B008GM1012,Elyse Wheeler,"[0, 0]","I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Civil Love was really, really clean, except for two scenes.  In the first, a man is shot and we see a very bloody wound.  In the second, he has to cut out the bullet, but you don't see a close up.  They cut the picture above the would so you only see some blood on his hands and shirt and you can tell he is in pain.  Two men intend to shoot a man to keep him silent about a situation.  In an exchange of fire one of them is killed and the other man runs off; a man is wounded with a gunshot to the shoulder and two other men intend to rob a woman, but are stopped.Most say the acting is amateurish and the storyline predictable.  That may be true, but other than the bloody scene (which I have to admit was not necessary to show), this movie was clean and had high morals and taught a good message.  The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for ages 12 and older.  Because it is a movie that takes place during the Civil War, talk of loss and men hunting another is expected.  It is probably the cleanest Civil War movie ever made, however, because of the two scenes with blood and the fact that a soldier is being hunted I wouldn't recommend it for children.  It is still move of an adult show.It starts with Daniel (a confederate soldier) fleeing from two men who shot him (this is where the wound is shown).  He hides in a barn, removes the bullet and passes out.  Rachel, the widow who own the farm, has two children.  While doing their chores they find him and the mother bandages his wound, leaves him food, but ties him up just to be safe.  She is afraid because her husband was killed by confederate soldiers in the war.  Daniel ends up saving her and the children from robbers and as they all learn to trust and care for each other, they become a makeshift family.  However, Rachel's brother-in-law and town sheriff, doesn't like the idea.  Rachel makes him promise not to arrest him or tell anyone about him, but he eventually finds it too much when Rachel's turns down his marriage proposal and she admits to caring for Daniel, so he tells the two men hunting Daniel where he is.  Rachel finds out and after telling her brother-in-law who the two men really are, they both go try and save Daniel and to arrest the two men.  As in most of these kinds of movies, all ends happily.Overall, I liked this move and would watch it again.",4,Civil Love - I would watch it again,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,2421,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Civil', 'Love', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'clean', 'two', 'scenes', 'first', 'man', 'shot', 'see', 'very', 'bloody', 'wound', 'second', 'cut', 'out', 'bullet', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'close', 'up', 'cut', 'picture', 'would', 'so', 'only', 'see', 'blood', 'hands', 'shirt', 'can', 'tell', 'pain', 'Two', 'men', 'intend', 'shoot', 'man', 'keep', 'silent', 'situation', 'exchange', 'fire', 'one', 'killed', 'other', 'man', 'off', 'man', 'wounded', 'gunshot', 'shoulder', 'two', 'other', 'men', 'intend', 'rob', 'woman', 'are', 'stopped.Most', 'say', 'acting', 'amateurish', 'storyline', 'predictable', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'other', 'bloody', 'scene', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'show', 'movie', 'was', 'clean', 'had', 'high', 'morals', 'taught', 'good', 'message', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'gave', 'five', 'star', 'approved', '12', 'older', 'movie', 'place', 'Civil', 'War', 'talk', 'loss', 'men', 'hunting', 'expected', 'probably', 'cleanest', 'Civil', 'War', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'however', 'two', 'scenes', 'blood', 'fact', 'soldier', 'being', 'hunted', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'children', 'still', 'move', 'adult', 'show.It', 'Daniel', 'confederate', 'soldier', 'fleeing', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'shot', 'where', 'wound', 'shown', 'barn', 'bullet', 'out', 'Rachel', 'widow', 'who', 'own', 'farm', 'two', 'children', 'doing', 'chores', 'find', 'mother', 'wound', 'food', 'up', 'just', 'be', 'safe', 'afraid', 'husband', 'was', 'killed', 'confederate', 'soldiers', 'war', 'Daniel', 'up', 'saving', 'children', 'robbers', 'learn', 'trust', 'care', 'other', 'become', 'makeshift', 'family', 'However', 'Rachel', 'brother-in-law', 'town', 'sheriff', ""n't"", 'like', 'idea', 'Rachel', 'promise', 'not', 'arrest', 'tell', 'anyone', 'eventually', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'Rachel', 'turns', 'down', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'caring', 'Daniel', 'two', 'men', 'hunting', 'Daniel', 'where', 'Rachel', 'out', 'telling', 'brother-in-law', 'who', 'two', 'men', 'really', 'are', 'go', 'try', 'save', 'Daniel', 'arrest', 'two', 'men', 'most', 'kinds', 'movies', 'happily.Overall', 'liked', 'move', 'would', 'watch', 'again']",Civil Love

A soldier for the Union Army during the Civil War, Rachel's husband was killed by enemy soldiers. When faced with a proposition to remarry the local sheriff, will Rachel do so, even if it means being married to someone she doesn't love? And what will she do about the stranger she found injured in her barn? After all, the stranger is a Confederate soldier - just like the ones who killed her husband.Daniel recently escaped from a Union Army prison. A Confederate soldier from Georgia, Daniel is shot in his attempt to return home. Will he survive the brutal cold? Will he be able to outrun the two men relentlessly searching for him? What happens when he collapses in a barn, only to discover later it is the barn of a woman who has lost her Union Army husband at the hands of Daniel's fellow soldiers?
