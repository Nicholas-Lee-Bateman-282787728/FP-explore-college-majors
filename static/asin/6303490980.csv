All  I  can  about  this  kid  he  faced  a  bad  accident  when  his  parents  died,  &  he  needed  that  old  mans  help.  He  was  very  difficult  to  get  along  with,  &  after  a  while  he  starts  softening  up  to  him.  I  believe  stuff  like  that  does  happen  in  real  life.Thats  what  makes  this  movie  so  interesting.  I  can  understand  that,  him  not  wanting  anything  to  do  with  the  kid,  he  didn't  want  to  get  involved  in  his  problems,  But  I  like  how  they  managed  to  finally  start  getting  along.

What I read about this movie is young Shroader and William Holden were very good friends in real life. Bill used to take Ricky camping, hunting, and shooting with him and when Bill became terminally ill, well, this movie was sort of their gift to each other. Ricky's sister plays a small part in this movie also. Set in Australia, a dying man returns to his wilderness home but finds a boy who needs his guidance - and many things are passed on from the older to the younger.
