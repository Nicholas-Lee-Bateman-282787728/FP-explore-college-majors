I love that the stories are realistic, but still very, very sweet. Caillou isn't always perfect, but he tries very hard to be a good boy, and my kids are able to see him effectivly resolve the problems that he occasionally encounters. For example, sometimes his sister, Rosie, gets on his nerves, but he deals with it and moves on. One of the things that I really like about the whole Caillou series are the realistic bodies of the adult characters. They aren't drawn like Jessica Rabbit, but rather like most adults who actually have kids (a little lumpy here and there).",5,We love Caillou !,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,665,"['three', 'kids', 'ages', '3', '2', '11', 'mo', 'love', 'Caillou', 'especially', 'son', 'two-year-old', 'love', 'stories', 'are', 'realistic', 'still', 'very', 'very', 'sweet', 'Caillou', ""n't"", 'always', 'perfect', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'good', 'boy', 'kids', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'effectivly', 'resolve', 'problems', 'occasionally', 'example', 'sometimes', 'sister', 'Rosie', 'nerves', 'One', 'things', 'really', 'whole', 'Caillou', 'series', 'are', 'realistic', 'bodies', 'adult', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'drawn', 'Jessica', 'Rabbit', 'rather', 'most', 'adults', 'who', 'actually', 'have', 'kids', 'little', 'lumpy', 'here', 'there']",Caillou's Winter Wonders
