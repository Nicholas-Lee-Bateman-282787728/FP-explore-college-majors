If I have time, I'll add 15-20 on the treadmill or elliptical beforehand; it aids with the warm-up, plus adds a bit more cardio time.  I have a weighted ball (not using the Firm version), so it minimizes the rolling around that other reviewers mentioned.  The downside is the ball-lifting moves at the beginning are more challenging since I am lifting a few extra pounds.  I also keep the remote handy so I can position myself during the transitions.  I've got a dozen or so Firm workouts; I used this one maybe once every ten days or so.",5,"Great, fun workout",1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,673,"['really', 'workout', 'Allie', 'fun', 'moves', 'vary', 'intensity', 'effort', 'especially', '30-minute', 'length', 'have', 'time', ""'ll"", 'add', '15-20', 'treadmill', 'elliptical', 'beforehand', 'warm-up', 'bit', 'more', 'cardio', 'time', 'have', 'weighted', 'ball', 'not', 'using', 'Firm', 'version', 'rolling', 'around', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'downside', 'ball-lifting', 'moves', 'beginning', 'are', 'more', 'challenging', 'am', 'lifting', 'few', 'extra', 'pounds', 'also', 'keep', 'remote', 'handy', 'can', 'position', 'transitions', ""'ve"", 'got', 'dozen', 'so', 'Firm', 'workouts', 'used', 'one', 'maybe', 'once', 'ten', 'days', 'so']",N/A

Williams,"[13, 13]","I originally wanted to watch this video first before even trying it, because i didn't want to waste my time if the video didn't look challenging. I mainly wanted the excercise ball. I watched for about 10 min and it seemed quite simple, so I decided to try it anyway. Well after about 5 min into the ""warm up"" i was sweating bullets and my heart rate was up! I was pleasantly surprised that i was actually getting a good full body workout. The only problem i had was that i wanted to concentrate a little more on the abs, and the excercises they did do for the abs it didn't seem long enough to get a burn. But overall, good dvd!",4,Good complete workout,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,629,"['originally', 'wanted', 'watch', 'video', 'first', 'before', 'even', 'trying', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'time', 'video', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'challenging', 'mainly', 'wanted', 'excercise', 'ball', 'watched', '10', 'min', 'seemed', 'quite', 'simple', 'decided', 'try', 'anyway', 'Well', '5', 'min', 'warm', 'up', 'i', 'was', 'sweating', 'bullets', 'heart', 'rate', 'was', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'i', 'was', 'actually', 'getting', 'good', 'full', 'body', 'workout', 'only', 'problem', 'i', 'had', 'was', 'i', 'wanted', 'concentrate', 'little', 'more', 'abs', 'excercises', 'did', 'do', 'abs', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'burn', 'overall', 'good', 'dvd']",N/A
