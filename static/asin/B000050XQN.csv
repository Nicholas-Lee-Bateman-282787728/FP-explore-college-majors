Welcome.Just the other day I reviewed &quot;The Real World You Never Saw,&quot; a DVD with new footage from the most recent season of MTV's &quot;Real World.&quot; Although the new footage was good, I thought there wasn't nearly enough of it, and the DVD was not worth its cost.Fortunately, that wasn't the case with the Survivor DVD. I thought it really delivered and that I got a lot for what I paid. The bulk of the DVD summarizes everything that happened throughout the season. It does so by putting the spotlight on each successive castaway in the order in which they were voted off.The DVD blended new and previously aired footage. I thought the mix was very good. The previously seen material was stuff I definitely wanted to see again anyway. The new footage was stuff that really helped flesh out who these people are and how they interacted with each other on the island. (If only some of the weaker reality shows had such good editors.) I really felt as if this DVD helped me to get to know the castaways better.In addition, to simply summarizing the season, there were a few segments that weren't necessary for understanding what happened but were great to see. For example, there was a challenge toward the end (right before Colleen got kicked off) where the castaways got to look at themselves in a mirror and guess how much weight they had lost. The person who got the closest received a small food reward. I assume this was never aired because of time limitations, but I was very glad it was included on the DVD. This is exactly the kind of stuff I wanted to see.From reading the Survivor book, I know there was another unaired reward challenge that took place on the first or second day on the island. If I remember correctly, Joel was the winner. I was surprised that this challenge wasn't also on the DVD, but perhaps the producers felt that it wasn't interesting enough.Anyway, I enjoyed the DVD very much, and I definitely felt that it was worth the money. If you've never seen SURVIVOR, you might have a bit of difficulty following what's going on on the DVD. (Wouldn't it be cool if the whole series were eventuially released on DVD? I'd love that.) However, if you watched and enjoyed the show, I can't imagine you not enjoying the DVD.

Ruocco,"[3, 7]","If Jeff Probst, the creator of the CBS meg-a-hit &quot;Survivor,&quot; actually believes that this DVD contains &quot;the greatest and most outrageous moments&quot; of the 13-part series, it's time to feed him to the crocodiles. What you get is 130 minutes of amusing recaps from all 13 episodes plus additional footage of Richard Hatch (UGH!) running about naked. If you haven't seen the full CBS series, you'll probably wonder why America is bonkers over &quot;Survivor.&quot; Or how Kelli, Sue, Rudy, Jenna, Sean and Hatch became household names. Probst is not a stupid man. He's in this strictly for the buck. That said, he should have released a box-set of the complete series with about 2 hours of deleted footage. But no, this quickie DVD (also available on VHS) contains pretty packaging and little else. Much is made about the audition tapes, the fighting, the immunity challenges, the bad weather, the lack of food and the voting procedures. Probst's Cheshire cast smile is grating. He professes to know all the answers, but I'd be willing to pay big bucks to see how well he would do during the immunity challenges. Yes, he's a smooth talker. Yes, he knows how to market himself and the show. But this isn't the DVD everyone's been waiting for. Sorry, Jeff.

563182,A1J4RAKN3MSUWH,B000050XQN,"J. Collins ""JCollins""","[16, 16]","I'll be the first to admit that I loathed the premise behind Survivor.  For all it's &quot;real life, uncensored drama,&quot; it was still an incredibly manipulative, voyeuristic program.  I got hooked on the show by the third week, when the various survivor names started sticking in my mind with the various survivor faces and personalities.  If anyone made it far enough in this series to have favorites, they were fans, whether they admit it or not.  Now that the show is revered as &quot;the&quot; reality TV event of 2000 (and not reviled, like Big Brother or the wretched Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire), viewers who were too 'principled' to watch the show faithfully can turn to this DVD for the rest of the story.  Those of us who became ravenous fans may find ourselves slightly disappointed with this compilation of &quot;greatest&quot; and &quot;most outrageous&quot; moments.The structure of this compilation is fairly straightforward: viewers are given a slightly expanded view of the pre-island days, and after establishing the basic premise of the two teams (and setup of the two camps), we go straight into the eliminations.  Each survivor gets their own &quot;chapter&quot; on DVD, in the order of their departures from competition.  These chapters highlight the social standing of each contestant, just prior to losing at tribal council.  The soon to be banished survivor's pre-selection interview and &quot;demo tape&quot; is spliced in with footage of them in various &quot;notable&quot; social interactions.  These are also the chapters in which continuity is ignored, and occasionally an already banished survivor appears, in interaction with the victim-to-be.Some of the &quot;heavier&quot; moments are highlighted, though virtually every minor alliance and casual friendship wound up on the cutting room floor.  That's the problem with taking 14+ hours of televised footage and straining it down to manageable 2 hour feature.  But don't worry that your favorite survivor's personality has been whitewashed: Stacy still comes off as snide, Gervase's lazy charm is in force, etc.  The survivors who lasted longest get the most exposure, of course.  Speaking of 'exposure,' parents can need not worry about the nudity warning that flashes onscreen before the program begins: there are half a dozen fanny shots (mostly Richard) that never made it to TV.  (Oh yeah...nice butt, Greg!)  Profanity is probably the only objectionable material here, since there are some four letter words that made the final cut.  For sheerly disgusting moments, nothing beats the fish-thing Richard catches, which starts to melt into slime the minute he cuts it open.  Yes, even worse than the larvae eating sequence.Of the many Survivor-related conversations I've had at work, it seems like a lot of people questioned &quot;actual&quot; personalities versus &quot;televised&quot; personalities.  No one can say how each survivor adapted their &quot;normal&quot; speech and activities for the sake of TV (remember Greg &amp; Colleen's fake fling?), but the way in which producers &quot;arranged&quot; and scored material to achieve a certain impact with TV audiences is reinforced here.  Again, some of the survivors (Sonja, BB, Ramona) register only nominal personalities, but many of the others were shown to audiences cast in the light of the producer's eyes.  So much of the &quot;total&quot; experience is edited that this DVD will reinforce the stereotypical character traits associated with each survivor...rather than show you a side of their personalities you didn't see when the show aired.The bonuses on this disc are fairly interesting.  There's a section of survivor bios (still frame reading) and voting histories, a map of survivor island and it's environs, a bit about the climate, vegetation and wildlife on the island, and a few other goodies.  The 'documentary' piece is a worthwhile extra, featuring narratives from host Jeff Probst and series creator Mark Bennett.  No, neither of them tells us who their favorite survivors were, but Probst' enthusiasm for the show makes his hokey host routine easier to bear.In spite of some over-familiarity and unavoidably massive editing, this Survivor compilation is probably a must-own for fans.  It's also a worthwhile 'document' in regard to television history, no less remarkable for it's manipulative premise.-Stoned Soul",4,A Fair Summary with some nice bonuses,979430400,"01 14, 2001",2001,4389,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'loathed', 'premise', 'Survivor', 'quot', 'real', 'life', 'uncensored', 'drama', 'quot', 'was', 'still', 'incredibly', 'manipulative', 'voyeuristic', 'program', 'got', 'hooked', 'show', 'third', 'week', 'when', 'various', 'survivor', 'names', 'started', 'sticking', 'mind', 'various', 'survivor', 'personalities', 'anyone', 'made', 'far', 'enough', 'series', 'have', 'favorites', 'were', 'fans', 'admit', 'not', 'Now', 'show', 'revered', 'quot', 'quot', 'reality', 'TV', 'event', '2000', 'not', 'reviled', 'Big', 'Brother', 'wretched', 'Who', 'Marry', 'A', 'Millionaire', 'viewers', 'who', 'were', 'too', ""'principled"", 'watch', 'show', 'faithfully', 'can', 'turn', 'DVD', 'rest', 'story', 'who', 'became', 'ravenous', 'fans', 'may', 'find', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'compilation', 'quot', 'greatest', 'quot', 'quot', 'most', 'outrageous', 'quot', 'moments.The', 'structure', 'compilation', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'viewers', 'are', 'given', 'slightly', 'expanded', 'view', 'pre-island', 'days', 'establishing', 'basic', 'premise', 'two', 'teams', 'setup', 'two', 'camps', 'go', 'straight', 'eliminations', 'survivor', 'own', 'quot', 'chapter', 'quot', 'DVD', 'order', 'departures', 'competition', 'chapters', 'highlight', 'social', 'standing', 'contestant', 'just', 'prior', 'losing', 'tribal', 'council', 'soon', 'be', 'banished', 'survivor', 'pre-selection', 'interview', 'quot', 'demo', 'tape', 'quot', 'spliced', 'footage', 'various', 'quot', 'notable', 'quot', 'social', 'interactions', 'are', 'also', 'chapters', 'continuity', 'ignored', 'occasionally', 'already', 'banished', 'survivor', 'interaction', 'victim-to-be.Some', 'quot', 'heavier', 'quot', 'moments', 'are', 'highlighted', 'virtually', 'minor', 'alliance', 'casual', 'friendship', 'wound', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'problem', 'taking', '14+', 'hours', 'televised', 'footage', 'straining', 'down', 'manageable', '2', 'hour', 'feature', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'favorite', 'survivor', 'personality', 'been', 'whitewashed', 'Stacy', 'still', 'off', 'snide', 'Gervase', 'lazy', 'charm', 'force', 'etc', 'survivors', 'who', 'lasted', 'longest', 'get', 'most', 'exposure', 'course', 'Speaking', ""'exposure"", 'parents', 'can', 'need', 'not', 'worry', 'nudity', 'warning', 'onscreen', 'program', 'are', 'dozen', 'fanny', 'shots', 'mostly', 'Richard', 'never', 'made', 'TV', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'nice', 'butt', 'Greg', 'Profanity', 'probably', 'only', 'objectionable', 'material', 'here', 'are', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'sheerly', 'disgusting', 'moments', 'nothing', 'fish-thing', 'Richard', 'catches', 'melt', 'slime', 'minute', 'open', 'Yes', 'even', 'worse', 'larvae', 'eating', 'sequence.Of', 'many', 'Survivor-related', 'conversations', ""'ve"", 'had', 'work', 'lot', 'people', 'questioned', 'quot', 'actual', 'quot', 'personalities', 'versus', 'quot', 'televised', 'quot', 'personalities', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'how', 'survivor', 'adapted', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'speech', 'activities', 'sake', 'TV', 'remember', 'Greg', 'amp', 'Colleen', 'fake', 'fling', 'way', 'producers', 'quot', 'arranged', 'quot', 'scored', 'material', 'achieve', 'certain', 'impact', 'TV', 'audiences', 'reinforced', 'here', 'Again', 'survivors', 'Sonja', 'BB', 'Ramona', 'register', 'only', 'nominal', 'personalities', 'many', 'others', 'were', 'shown', 'audiences', 'cast', 'light', 'producer', 'eyes', 'So', 'much', 'quot', 'total', 'quot', 'experience', 'edited', 'DVD', 'will', 'reinforce', 'stereotypical', 'character', 'traits', 'associated', 'survivor', 'rather', 'show', 'side', 'personalities', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'when', 'show', 'aired.The', 'bonuses', 'disc', 'are', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'section', 'survivor', 'bios', 'still', 'frame', 'reading', 'voting', 'histories', 'map', 'survivor', 'island', 'environs', 'bit', 'climate', 'vegetation', 'wildlife', 'island', 'few', 'other', 'goodies', ""'documentary"", 'piece', 'worthwhile', 'extra', 'featuring', 'narratives', 'host', 'Jeff', 'Probst', 'series', 'creator', 'Mark', 'Bennett', 'No', 'neither', 'tells', 'who', 'favorite', 'survivors', 'were', 'Probst', 'enthusiasm', 'show', 'hokey', 'host', 'routine', 'easier', 'bear.In', 'spite', 'over-familiarity', 'unavoidably', 'massive', 'editing', 'Survivor', 'compilation', 'probably', 'must-own', 'fans', 'also', 'worthwhile', ""'document"", 'regard', 'television', 'history', 'less', 'remarkable', 'manipulative', 'premise.-Stoned', 'Soul']",N/A

563185,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000050XQN,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","Now that we are up to the fourth round of ""Survivor"" it is rather interesting to go back and watch the original contest once again for several reasons.  First, just as it was always interesting to watch an episode a second time to see how Mark Burnett tried to simultaneously set up and disguise the ending in terms of who got voted off the island that week, it is interesting to see how the gang of four are set up.  I thought the greatest success of the show was that even when we reached the point that it was clear who the final four were going to be that it managed to create doubt each and every week as we talked things over at the office and kept thinking that sooner or later the rest of the survivors would catch on and do something about it.  I am always interested in the show about the show; in one regard I liked the 24/7 coverage of ""Big Brother"" that was available on line (for free) the first time because you could compare what ""really happened"" in the house with what they actually aired.  The ""new"" clips provided on this tape give you a little more information in this regard, but you can pick up more from the various books about the show.Second, watching the original ""Survivor"" again also reaffirms the closeness of the competition.  By the time they got to the endgame I was voting for Rich, but when Kelly won all those immunity competitions in a row I was thinking that maybe this was a sign from the gods or something.  However, I was too busy trying to figure out how the others were going to vote to ever really decide who I would have actually voted for if I had been at the final tribal council.  But when you can argue that it came down to Greg's ""pick a number"" nonsense, I think our society really needs to reconsider the cultural lesson of Rich's final victory.  Even if you go back to the first tribal council of the merger, where the gang of four took our Gretchen and everybody else voted for a different person, you can see how easily things could have gone the other way.  Unfortunately, Gretchen's tribe was the first and only one in ""Survivor"" history NOT to go after someone from the ""other"" tribe immediately after the merger (although, yes, the current group of clowns ate one of their own instead of voting off one of the lazy jerks from the other tribe that joined when the tribes were all shook up).  If Gretchen's tribe has immediately gone after the weakest member of the ""other"" tribe (Kelly?), then they would have won on a 5-4 vote, and odds are Gretchen would have ended up winning.Now think about how much that would impact our culture if the person who was best at ""surviving"" won instead of the person who played ""Survivor"" the best.  A key distinction, especially since the vast majority of survivors since then have taken Rich's victory as a sacred blueprint, carved in tablets of gold or something, instead of a series of situations breaking just the right way.  In his post-game interviews Rich has kept alive the myth that his victory was inevitable, that he was in control every step of the way.  There is some validity to this claim in terms of voting, but there is also some revisionist history involved here.  In a sense Rich wins by default because no matter how many times it was painfully obvious what was happening with regards to the voting, the other survivors refused to wake up, smell the coffee and write ""RICH"" at tribal council.Besides: Rich's big contribution was his ability to catch fish and feed the others.  If the original ""Survivor"" had taken place in Australia or Africa, what would he have done to offset his personality?Judging by those who have followed, the lesson of Rich's victory is be, in the immortal words of Sue, a ""snake.""  However, ironically enough, those who have followed the gospel according to Rich have not been the ones who win or even finish second.  Yet many of the other survivors in Australia insisted on characterizing their winner as being evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty because she ""played the game"" well.  Maybe it all comes down to the fact that I would have liked to have lived in a world where Gretchen was the winner rather than Rich, especially given the social importance that has been placed on what happened.  But, it was so CLOSE!",4,"Reconsidering Rich and the first season of ""Survivor""",1020124800,"04 30, 2002",2002,4256,"['Now', 'are', 'up', 'fourth', 'round', 'Survivor', 'rather', 'interesting', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'original', 'contest', 'once', 'again', 'several', 'reasons', 'First', 'just', 'was', 'always', 'interesting', 'watch', 'episode', 'second', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'Mark', 'Burnett', 'tried', 'simultaneously', 'set', 'up', 'disguise', 'ending', 'terms', 'who', 'got', 'voted', 'island', 'week', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'gang', 'four', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'thought', 'greatest', 'success', 'show', 'was', 'even', 'when', 'reached', 'point', 'was', 'clear', 'who', 'final', 'four', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'managed', 'create', 'doubt', 'week', 'talked', 'things', 'office', 'kept', 'thinking', 'sooner', 'later', 'rest', 'survivors', 'would', 'catch', 'do', 'something', 'am', 'always', 'interested', 'show', 'show', 'one', 'regard', 'liked', '24/7', 'coverage', 'Big', 'Brother', 'was', 'available', 'line', 'free', 'first', 'time', 'could', 'compare', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'house', 'what', 'actually', 'aired', 'new', 'clips', 'provided', 'tape', 'give', 'little', 'more', 'information', 'regard', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'more', 'various', 'books', 'show.Second', 'watching', 'original', 'Survivor', 'again', 'also', 'closeness', 'competition', 'time', 'got', 'endgame', 'was', 'voting', 'Rich', 'when', 'Kelly', 'won', 'immunity', 'competitions', 'row', 'was', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'was', 'sign', 'gods', 'something', 'However', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'others', 'were', 'going', 'vote', 'ever', 'really', 'decide', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'voted', 'had', 'been', 'final', 'tribal', 'council', 'when', 'can', 'argue', 'came', 'down', 'Greg', 'pick', 'number', 'nonsense', 'think', 'society', 'really', 'reconsider', 'cultural', 'lesson', 'Rich', 'final', 'victory', 'Even', 'go', 'back', 'first', 'tribal', 'council', 'merger', 'where', 'gang', 'four', 'took', 'Gretchen', 'everybody', 'else', 'voted', 'different', 'person', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'easily', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'other', 'way', 'Unfortunately', 'Gretchen', 'tribe', 'was', 'first', 'only', 'one', 'Survivor', 'history', 'NOT', 'go', 'someone', 'other', 'tribe', 'immediately', 'merger', 'yes', 'current', 'group', 'clowns', 'ate', 'one', 'own', 'instead', 'voting', 'off', 'one', 'lazy', 'jerks', 'other', 'tribe', 'joined', 'when', 'tribes', 'were', 'shook', 'up', 'Gretchen', 'tribe', 'immediately', 'gone', 'weakest', 'member', 'other', 'tribe', 'Kelly', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'won', '5-4', 'vote', 'odds', 'are', 'Gretchen', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'winning.Now', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'impact', 'culture', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'best', 'surviving', 'won', 'instead', 'person', 'who', 'played', 'Survivor', 'best', 'key', 'distinction', 'especially', 'vast', 'majority', 'survivors', 'then', 'have', 'taken', 'Rich', 'victory', 'sacred', 'blueprint', 'carved', 'tablets', 'gold', 'something', 'instead', 'series', 'situations', 'breaking', 'just', 'right', 'way', 'post-game', 'interviews', 'Rich', 'kept', 'myth', 'victory', 'was', 'inevitable', 'was', 'control', 'step', 'way', 'validity', 'claim', 'terms', 'voting', 'also', 'revisionist', 'history', 'involved', 'here', 'sense', 'Rich', 'default', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'regards', 'voting', 'other', 'survivors', 'refused', 'wake', 'up', 'smell', 'coffee', 'write', 'RICH', 'tribal', 'council.Besides', 'Rich', 'big', 'contribution', 'was', 'ability', 'catch', 'fish', 'feed', 'others', 'original', 'Survivor', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'Australia', 'Africa', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'offset', 'personality', 'Judging', 'who', 'have', 'followed', 'lesson', 'Rich', 'victory', 'be', 'immortal', 'words', 'Sue', 'snake', 'However', 'ironically', 'enough', 'who', 'have', 'followed', 'gospel', 'according', 'Rich', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'ones', 'who', 'win', 'even', 'finish', 'second', 'many', 'other', 'survivors', 'Australia', 'insisted', 'characterizing', 'winner', 'being', 'evil', 'wicked', 'bad', 'mean', 'nasty', 'played', 'game', 'well', 'Maybe', 'down', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'lived', 'world', 'where', 'Gretchen', 'was', 'winner', 'rather', 'Rich', 'especially', 'given', 'social', 'importance', 'been', 'placed', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'so', 'CLOSE']",N/A

The DVD shows all the tribal council but does not show the show challenges, which happen to be the most interesting thing on the program.The cast was really weird: a 39 year old and gay man, an old marine guy, a black woman who did not have white friends, an elderly lady who had cancer, a crazy and hippie guy called greg, a tough woman called sue, among others.One of the craziest moments was the final tribal thing, where the last two participants had to be voted by a jury composed by the rest of the cast previously eliminated.

Kelly, one of the finalists, was deeply offended by Sue, and I think it was really hard for kelly to hear her speech without attacking her back.Anyway, here in Brazil we are watching the second season of a show based on &quot;survivors&quot; and it was really cool for me to watch the original version of the show, which started this whole competition.So, that's it.

It takes you through all the players and some of the things that they had to do, in the order that they were voted off.  It's a highlights disk instead of a replay of the shows.  My sister missed the first and second seasons, so this was a great for her to catch up.  The best thing about watching Survivor, is that you get to see people stabbing each other in the back to win some silly money.  You see, that happens everyday at work, it's just hidden.  You don't even know when your being stabbed in the back.  The show helps me look for it at work.

It was then that I knew how much I had missed.This DVD isn't bad. While it is impossible to squeeze what happened in a whole season into one DVD, it told enough. I knew who I liked and who I didn't from watching it. Since I didn't watch most of the series on TV, I really cannot tell what were the new scenes and what was not. However, I can say that if you watched the series and you want a recap then buy it! It's not too expensive and the disk itself pays itself back just to be able to watch the Survivors' homemade tapes. Especially Sue's! She was nasty in the end but at least her tape was funny.All we need now is the boxed set of the whole season...",4,Not bad at all,986342400,"04 4, 2001",2001,750,"['missed', 'almost', 'whole', 'season', 'Survivor', 'managed', 'catch', 'last', '3', 'episodes', 'TV', 'was', 'then', 'knew', 'how', 'much', 'had', 'missed.This', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'bad', 'impossible', 'squeeze', 'what', 'happened', 'whole', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'told', 'enough', 'knew', 'who', 'liked', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'most', 'series', 'TV', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'were', 'new', 'scenes', 'what', 'was', 'not', 'However', 'can', 'say', 'watched', 'series', 'want', 'recap', 'then', 'buy', 'not', 'too', 'expensive', 'disk', 'back', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'Survivors', 'homemade', 'tapes', 'Especially', 'Sue', 'was', 'nasty', 'end', 'least', 'tape', 'was', 'funny.All', 'need', 'now', 'boxed', 'set', 'whole', 'season']",N/A
