794474,A1KRAV23YTSUTF,B00016XNHK,"Arthur D. O'Brien ""Art""","[3, 4]","As the previous review states, this was aired in the U.S. in the early 1970s as ""My Partner, The Ghost.""  It is quirky, off-beat British humor and standard late-sixties private eye format rolled into one.  Fun to watch, and light-hearted entertainment at its best and its most clever - a little cheesy and dated in some ways, but that adds to its charm.  I have very fond memories of watching this late at night in the San Francisco Bay Area with my brother in the room we shared when I was 11-12 years-old.This set actually comprises only one-half of the original 26 episodes that aired in its only season in Britain (1969-70).  Why the remaining 13 episodes are not included here is a mystery to me.  Clearly, since they are calling this ""Set 1"" there is also a ""Set 2"" planned down the road.This, however, is unacceptable as a COMPLETE series set of 26 episodes is out in the U.K. for roughly the same cost, but unfortunately cannot be played in U.S. machines.  Why the money-grab from this title which is sure not to sell piles of copies in the U.S.?  Perhaps to squeeze maximum dollars from those who WILL buy.

For many years I wished some television station would bring it back in reruns, but to no avail as of yet. Fortunately we have been gifted with this DVD set, so we can relive those days watching this fine show. As one reviewer noted, I remember an eerie atmosphere about it as a kid watching...especially when during the opening credits it shows ""deceased"" stamped over Hopkirk's name on the door to their office! A nice thing about this intro to the show is it totally explains the plot line, so someone not familiar with it would know what was going on on their first viewing. I believe most purchasers will be folks like us who remember the show from the 70's and have longed to see it again...but anyone who would like a detective drama with a supernatural twist should certainly love it as we do; it is not a frightening twist, but I believe it still carries some wonderful eerieness!

794483,A3559I6Q7RCPP3,B00016XNHK,"Robert Cossaboon ""devil doll""","[23, 24]","Welcome to the world of Randall and Hopkirk, Deceased.  I can remember when I was very small how this series was once ran on my local TV station in the States as My Partner, The Ghost.  At the time it seemed very somber and I can remember feeling a little uneasy from the general mood of each episode.....ok, I was scared.  Boy, I never knew how good I had it until I purchased the first volume of this treasure trove!  R&amp;H is an interesting alternative to the other popular series of the time such as the Avengers,  the Prisoner (despite its mere 17 episode run), I Spy, and the Man From U.N.C.L.E.  For my money it's also got the coolest theme song going-but then I'm prejudiced in favor of the harpsichord.  I think what set this series apart was the seedy approach it took to fighting crime.  For the most part, the villains are not megalomaniacal masterminds trying to deep-six their own country.  These guys usually go the route of murder and the stakes are usually some small financial potatoes, relatively speaking.  Also, our heroes are always just barely making ends meet; they always seem to find another case just in the nick of time to avoid bankruptcy for another episode.  Additionally, the character of Jeff Randall is more of an anti-hero than anything else-his priorities are money, women, and keeping the job afloat; somewhere in there is a sense of justice mixed in, but it's very low on the priority scale!  But in my opinion, the nervous, anxiety-fueled character of Marty Hopkirk (played by Kenneth Cope) and how he interacts with his live partner, Jeff, as well as deals with the day-to-day stresses of the job (such as murder!)  is what drives this series.  Need other reasons to try this series?  How about the pristine transfer!  I agree with the Great Lakes reviewer that Marty the ghost is sometimes difficult to see, but that could've just been because of back-then production shortsightedness.  There are extras:  a cool picture gallery, and a nice little History Channel ditty.  A&amp;E get a truckload of thanks for championing this forgotten series and giving it the resurrection it so richly deserves!

794484,A142ZUGDGWE1NY,B00016XNHK,St. Ananas,"[17, 17]","Has anyone bought this that didn't have vague fond memories of watching this (My Partner the Ghost) as a child?  I too am in that boat.I feared watching this might spoil my memories.  Fortunately I find I had fine taste as a youngster, because this show was very enjoyable as an adult.  This time around it seemed less eerie, and was more nostalgic, campy fun.This is the story of a pair of detectives, Jeff and Marty, one of whom is murdered on a case.  Thankfully the only sad part in the series happens right away.  Marty promptly returns to help Jeff, and also keep an eye on his widow Jeannie, now working in the office with Jeff.  Naturally part of the fun is that only Jeff can see Marty (with a couple rare exceptions).The premise holds up, thanks to actors who seem to have just the right touch, and the show is as entertaining as it sounds.The stories are all pretty light, even when murder is involved.  The plots are kind of small-potato Avengeresque.  A plotting, sinister, bad-guy taking over an inheritance, rather than a mad/sinister agency attempting to take over the world.The fact that one of the private detectives is a ghost leaves an anything-can-happen feel. While a lot of far-out adventures occur, it never goes beyond the great-beyond for supernatural storylines.  In other words, they don't get into sci-fi (aliens), or horror movie type(vampires) plots.  It happily sticks to a private-eye mystery show with a fun twist.I enjoyed this as much as when I caught some Ellery Queen and Banacek re-runs a few years back (other long-lost childhood detective heroes).I have seen this was released in England as an entire set of 26 episodes.

794485,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00016XNHK,trebe,"[3, 11]","Jeff Randall (Mike Pratt) and Marty Hopkirk (Kenneth Cope), are partners in a private investigation agency.  In the program's first episode, Hopkirk is run down and killed while on a case.  He returns to Earth as a ghost that only his ex-partner can see and hear, seeking to bring his killer to justice.  After the initial shock, Randall and Hopkirk are again a team, working together on entirely different terms.  Annette Andre, costars as Hopkirk's widow Jean, who unfortunately is unable to perceive her ghostly spouse.This unusual premise takes capable writing to keep the plots from turning into drivel.  Unfortunately the stories do not always hold together particularly well, often starting out well enough, but unraveling along the way.  The supernatural element provides ample opportunities to introduce humor, and also allows the plots to wander far and wide.  Drifting off into fantasy is something that a program like the Avengers can pull off, but here the characters are not as strong, and it frequently doesn't play very well.  The special effects employed are similar to other programs of the time like Bewitched or I Dream of Jeannie, as Marty pops in and out the scenes.  The novelty of having a ghost in the cast, soon becomes passe.Kenneth Cope, often plays Hopkirk as an over-animated and wide-eyed goof.  Prancing about in a white suit, he can do little to directly affect earthly events.  Usually only mildly amusing, his ghostly powers make him an ideal agent for gathering information, and he is a frequent eavesdropper.  Mike Pratt, as Jeff Randall has the meatier ""straight man"" role.  Providing the voice of reason, he keeps things grounded in reality while Marty does his ethereal thing.  Randall struggles to keep the business viable, with Jean as his secretary.  Likeable, but not overly so, Randall is not typical leading man material.  His serious working class approach, and determination to succeed, is the rock upon which the show is built on.  This characterization and his frequent scowls, do not quite match the playboy image of his bachelor pad, which is decorated with pop art wall posters more appropriate to a much younger man.  Pratt who died from lung cancer in 1976, lights up a cigarette during the opening credits, and is frequently seen chain smoking throughout the series.The transfer to DVD is for the most part clean, however the colors often look washed out and flat.  Ms. Andre is lovely, but her completion is very pale, and the harsh lighting often makes her face appear as if she were a ""ghost"" as well.  One plus is the music.  Composer Edwin Astley provided the music for programs like Danger Man, and The Saint, and his music here is similar to those other series.  Randall and Hopkirk Deceased, appeared on American TV titled as My Partner the Ghost.  The gimmicky premise and spotty writing of this offbeat drama should limit its appeal.

794486,A22S7ZEJHU3TGE,B00016XNHK,Warwick Bennett,"[0, 0]","This is a wonderful comedy-drama from UK television company ITC. The leads are perfectly cast: Mike Pratt is very believable as the ordinary guy struggling to make a living as a private detective; Kenneth Cope is perfect as the debonair ghost, and the team is nicely complemented by Annette Andre as Hopkirk's widow who helps out as secretary to the surviving partner, Randall. This was one of my favourite shows when it first came out and I still love it. What I don't understand is the price being charged for this set. It has been on my wish list for some time, but I have just picked up a brand new set of the complete series, here in New Zealand (NOT a bootleg, but a genuine original boxed set, released by ITC, the makers of the show) for the equivalent of $14 in American money. Amazon prices are usually quite good, even with the international postage, but for this one they're charging nearly six times as much as I paid, and for only half as many episodes!",5,"Great Show, but What's with the Price?",1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,967,"['wonderful', 'comedy-drama', 'UK', 'television', 'company', 'ITC', 'leads', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Mike', 'Pratt', 'very', 'believable', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'struggling', 'make', 'living', 'private', 'detective', 'Kenneth', 'Cope', 'perfect', 'debonair', 'ghost', 'team', 'nicely', 'complemented', 'Annette', 'Andre', 'Hopkirk', 'widow', 'who', 'out', 'secretary', 'surviving', 'partner', 'Randall', 'was', 'one', 'favourite', 'shows', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'still', 'love', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'price', 'being', 'charged', 'set', 'been', 'wish', 'list', 'time', 'have', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'brand', 'new', 'set', 'complete', 'series', 'here', 'New', 'Zealand', 'NOT', 'bootleg', 'genuine', 'original', 'boxed', 'set', 'released', 'ITC', 'makers', 'show', 'equivalent', '14', 'American', 'money', 'Amazon', 'prices', 'are', 'usually', 'quite', 'good', 'even', 'international', 'postage', 'one', ""'re"", 'charging', 'nearly', 'six', 'times', 'as', 'much', 'paid', 'only', 'half', 'many', 'episodes']",Randall and Hopkirk
