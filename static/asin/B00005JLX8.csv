607934,A17BUUBOU0598B,B00005JLX8,,"[3, 4]","The type of character that is portrayed inRoger Dodgeris like a lot of guys I have met.  I have known guys that slowly drifted into seeking to stroke their egos by sleeping with anybody they could and acting like they were WAY COOLER than they actually were.  That is why this portrayal is so amazing.  It takes a lot for an actor to portray such a polarizing character this well.  This is truly a great film for lovers of great acting.Some people may relate to this character and find his desperation and antics funny.  Others may be revolted by his personality.  I am more in the second camp.  One thing is for certain, this role was nailed by the lead actor, Campbell Scott.The Story and the ScriptRoger's character is manipulative, egotistical and yet obviously trying to compensate for something.  He has an affair with his boss, played by Isabella Rossallini.  Yet it's really more like she uses him till she tires of him.  As he drifts from bar to bar trying to pick up women with transparent and conceited attempts to seem intelligent and observant, we get to see just how clueless, pathetic and desperate he really is.  Oh yeah, this is a NY city story for sure!When his nephew Nick comes to the city for college interviews, Roger takes him to many places where he shouldn't be.  Roger revels in feeling like he has a lot to teach young Nick about women, yet Nick seems to do better just being himself instead of using Roger's sleazy tactics.  While I won't give away the entire plot, suffice it to say it's not the story but rather the performances that impress.In many ways, the supporting cast in particular seems to have been given sparse lines.  Yet the acting and direction are so good that the script is perfectly supported.The CastCampbell Scott really opened my eyes with his portrayal of Roger.  Somehow he was able to really capture and portray the complicated mix of negative and positive character traits.Jesse Eisenberg is very impressive, but his part was clearly written in a way that makes it easier to play than Roger's.  Isabella Rossallini is wonderful as always.Yet the roles played by Elizabeth Berkeley and Jennifer Beals are perfect examples of why this film works.  On the one hand, they have minimal roles with few lines.  Yet the close camera work allows you to see so many non-verbal cues in their faces and gestures.  Their roles are minimal, yet highly impactful because of the way they are executed.  Roger's co-workers by and large have similarly understated yet effective roles.ConclusionI highly recommend this movie to actors and lovers of independent film.  If you are a huge fan of dialogue and sharp wit, you will find yourself pulled in to this movie.  Definitely check it out.Enjoy!",5,Roger Dodger - Compelling and Revolting All At Once,1217116800,"07 27, 2008",2008,2731,"['type', 'character', 'portrayed', 'inRoger', 'Dodgeris', 'lot', 'guys', 'have', 'met', 'have', 'known', 'guys', 'slowly', 'drifted', 'seeking', 'stroke', 'egos', 'sleeping', 'anybody', 'could', 'acting', 'were', 'WAY', 'COOLER', 'actually', 'were', 'why', 'portrayal', 'so', 'amazing', 'lot', 'actor', 'portray', 'polarizing', 'character', 'well', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'lovers', 'great', 'acting.Some', 'people', 'may', 'relate', 'character', 'find', 'desperation', 'antics', 'funny', 'Others', 'may', 'be', 'revolted', 'personality', 'am', 'more', 'second', 'camp', 'One', 'thing', 'certain', 'role', 'was', 'nailed', 'lead', 'actor', 'Campbell', 'Scott.The', 'Story', 'ScriptRoger', 'character', 'manipulative', 'egotistical', 'yet', 'obviously', 'trying', 'compensate', 'something', 'affair', 'boss', 'played', 'Isabella', 'Rossallini', 'really', 'more', 'till', 'tires', 'bar', 'bar', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'women', 'transparent', 'conceited', 'attempts', 'seem', 'intelligent', 'observant', 'get', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'clueless', 'pathetic', 'desperate', 'really', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'NY', 'city', 'story', 'sure', 'When', 'nephew', 'Nick', 'city', 'college', 'interviews', 'Roger', 'many', 'places', 'where', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'Roger', 'revels', 'feeling', 'lot', 'teach', 'young', 'Nick', 'women', 'yet', 'Nick', 'do', 'better', 'just', 'being', 'instead', 'using', 'Roger', 'sleazy', 'tactics', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'entire', 'plot', 'suffice', 'say', 'not', 'story', 'rather', 'performances', 'impress.In', 'many', 'ways', 'supporting', 'cast', 'particular', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'sparse', 'lines', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'script', 'perfectly', 'supported.The', 'CastCampbell', 'Scott', 'really', 'opened', 'eyes', 'portrayal', 'Roger', 'Somehow', 'was', 'able', 'really', 'capture', 'portray', 'complicated', 'mix', 'negative', 'positive', 'character', 'traits.Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'very', 'impressive', 'part', 'was', 'clearly', 'written', 'way', 'easier', 'play', 'Roger', 'Isabella', 'Rossallini', 'wonderful', 'roles', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkeley', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'are', 'perfect', 'examples', 'why', 'film', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'minimal', 'roles', 'few', 'lines', 'close', 'camera', 'work', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'non-verbal', 'cues', 'gestures', 'roles', 'are', 'minimal', 'yet', 'highly', 'impactful', 'way', 'are', 'executed', 'Roger', 'co-workers', 'large', 'have', 'similarly', 'understated', 'yet', 'effective', 'roles.ConclusionI', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'actors', 'lovers', 'independent', 'film', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'wit', 'will', 'find', 'pulled', 'movie', 'Definitely', 'check', 'out.Enjoy']",Roger Dodger
607935,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLX8,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Watching Campbell Scott work is magic on this third season of `Damages' (that show is just BRILLIANT) has made me want to review his finest hour, `Roger Dodger'.  This is a film that didn't strike me so much the first time I saw it, but as I sat and thought it over it became evident that this film was something very special.  Oh yeah, Scott's performance is phenomenal (how that NBR win didn't translate to an Oscar nomination is beyond me).The film has a very simple premise.  Campbell Scott plays Roger Swanson, a successful business man (making his living telling lies) who is a self-proclaimed ladies man who uses his suave yet blunt personality to get himself between any sheets he sets his mind to.  His confidence finds itself shaken when he receives a rejection he wasn't expecting (from his boss no less) and when his nephew shows up at his place of business looking for some attention he finds that his destructive tendencies have casualties outside of his own digression.I want to make this clear.  The film seems to almost slide ferociously into chaos in the final chapter, and while this may come off rather misplaced, especially when considering the fact that the first three-quarters run much slower and more calculated than the chaotic ending, it is really genius the way that Dylan Kidd uses Roger's own mental breakdown as a catalyst for spinning the films core out of control.It makes total sense when you put everything on Roger's back.The film really rides beautifully on the cast.  Sure, there is really only two main character's in play here; Roger and his nephew Nick (Scott and Eisenberg respectively), but Kidd made sure that even the most minute of supporting player is fleshed out with vividly realized performances.  When Roger and Nick pick up two girls in a bar you are instantly drawn into their stories because they are marvelously portrayed (who would ever have thought that Elizabeth Berkley could pull off such a layered and natural performance).  Jesse Eisenberg is a young star I'm not too familiar with (although he has a following now), but this performance is rather remarkable when you really analyze it.  He never allows the weight of the eventualities to ware at him, and he evokes an awkward confidence that beautifully contrasts the arrogant swagger of his uncle.  I love Isabella Rossellini, and she is astonishing here as well (she plays off of Scott's aggressive nature flawlessly).And then there is Campbell Scott.  I mean, this performance is just downright flawless.  I don't even know what to say.  The way he taps into this mans seething realities is just unprecedented.  I love how he reveals his character's glitches in the way he shifts his eyes, like when Nick is revealing issues at home, he almost instinctively feels compelled to act yet his ingrained persona kicks in and he dispels all emotion.  The downward and chaotic spiral of degradation at the films climax is just another glimpse into this man's bitter unhappiness.And here is the kicker; the film never addresses it outright, which I think is GEEEE-NEEEE-US!Like I said, when the film ended I was left scratching my head for a bit.  I was thrown off by the sudden and drastic shift in tone, and then the ending `almost' seemed like a copout, but as I reflecting on the film and watched it a few more times I found that it all strangely feels so appropriate.Certainly one of the best films of 2002, and Campbell Scott's performance is one of the best of the decade, easy!",5,"Downright seducing, in a destructively intelligent sense...",1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,3493,"['Watching', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'work', 'magic', 'third', 'season', 'Damages', 'show', 'just', 'BRILLIANT', 'made', 'want', 'review', 'finest', 'hour', 'Roger', 'Dodger', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'sat', 'thought', 'became', 'evident', 'film', 'was', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Scott', 'performance', 'phenomenal', 'how', 'NBR', 'win', 'did', ""n't"", 'translate', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '.The', 'film', 'very', 'simple', 'premise', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Roger', 'Swanson', 'successful', 'business', 'man', 'making', 'living', 'telling', 'lies', 'who', 'self-proclaimed', 'ladies', 'man', 'who', 'suave', 'yet', 'blunt', 'personality', 'get', 'sheets', 'mind', 'confidence', 'shaken', 'when', 'rejection', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'boss', 'less', 'when', 'nephew', 'up', 'place', 'business', 'looking', 'attention', 'destructive', 'tendencies', 'have', 'casualties', 'own', 'digression.I', 'want', 'make', 'clear', 'film', 'almost', 'slide', 'ferociously', 'chaos', 'final', 'chapter', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'rather', 'misplaced', 'especially', 'when', 'considering', 'fact', 'first', 'three-quarters', 'run', 'much', 'slower', 'more', 'calculated', 'chaotic', 'ending', 'really', 'genius', 'way', 'Dylan', 'Kidd', 'Roger', 'own', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'catalyst', 'spinning', 'films', 'core', 'control.It', 'total', 'sense', 'when', 'put', 'everything', 'Roger', 'back.The', 'film', 'really', 'beautifully', 'cast', 'Sure', 'really', 'only', 'two', 'main', 'character', 'play', 'here', 'Roger', 'nephew', 'Nick', 'Scott', 'Eisenberg', 'respectively', 'Kidd', 'made', 'sure', 'even', 'most', 'minute', 'supporting', 'player', 'fleshed', 'out', 'vividly', 'realized', 'performances', 'When', 'Roger', 'Nick', 'pick', 'up', 'two', 'girls', 'bar', 'are', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'stories', 'are', 'marvelously', 'portrayed', 'who', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'thought', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'layered', 'natural', 'performance', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'young', 'star', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'familiar', 'following', 'now', 'performance', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'when', 'really', 'analyze', 'never', 'weight', 'eventualities', 'ware', 'awkward', 'confidence', 'beautifully', 'arrogant', 'swagger', 'uncle', 'love', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'astonishing', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Scott', 'aggressive', 'nature', 'flawlessly', '.And', 'then', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'mean', 'performance', 'just', 'downright', 'flawless', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'way', 'seething', 'realities', 'just', 'unprecedented', 'love', 'how', 'character', 'glitches', 'way', 'eyes', 'when', 'Nick', 'revealing', 'issues', 'home', 'almost', 'instinctively', 'feels', 'compelled', 'act', 'yet', 'ingrained', 'persona', 'kicks', 'emotion', 'downward', 'chaotic', 'spiral', 'degradation', 'films', 'climax', 'just', 'glimpse', 'man', 'bitter', 'unhappiness.And', 'here', 'kicker', 'film', 'never', 'outright', 'think', 'GEEEE-NEEEE-US', 'said', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'was', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'bit', 'was', 'thrown', 'off', 'sudden', 'drastic', 'shift', 'tone', 'then', 'ending', 'almost', 'seemed', 'copout', 'reflecting', 'film', 'watched', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'found', 'strangely', 'feels', 'so', 'appropriate.Certainly', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2002', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'decade', 'easy']",Roger Dodger

Roger takes his 16-year old nephew under his wing to teach him the ropes.  In the end, it just may be the nephew who does the teaching.The more I think back on it, the more I end up liking this movie.  The very underrated Campbell Scott pulls off a brilliant performance.  And it's hard to believe this is the debut of first-time director Dylan Kidd.  His script is polished and very sharp.  And although the picture is mostly dark, the colors are really vibrant.  I don't agree with the shaky-cam (a technique Kidd says he'll go to his grave defending), but I wasn't nearly distracted by it either.So, the movie's good...but the DVD makes it a must-own.  So many DVD's today are loaded with trashy promotional featurettes--nothing that really tells about how the movie was made.  &quot;Roger Dodger&quot; does a whole lot better.  The special features are introduced by director Kidd calling it a kind-of film-school-in-a-box.  Interviews abound with all the faculty from Executive Producer to music and sound to casting director and more.  Also included is the trailer, a tip sheet for picking up women (repeated here from the movie), 2 audio commetaries, and a deleted scene with optional commentary.  The one throw-away feature is a guided tour of the New York locations from the movie.  A real good idea for a feature gets wasted here when the hosts (actors from the movie) turn it into 10 minutes of goofing off (and no, it's not funny).

607942,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00005JLX8,Darren,"[0, 0]","Campbell Scott's Role of a Lifetime.  In less capable hands, this movie might not work as well as it does, but Scott's pitch-perfect performance mesmerizes.  He plays a successful ad-copywriter in Manhattan who is also successful with the ladies.  He's got a few problems, though: he's forty-ish (getting a little long in the tooth for womanizing); he's romantically involved with his boss (Isabella Rossellini) who is tiring of him; he's alone.  He has a family somewhere in Ohio, but only the occasional funeral brings him home.  Enter Jesse Eisenberg (his first major movie role) as the nephew, eager to learn a few tips from this modern-day Don Juan.  Since the rest of his life is at a standstill, Scott agrees to give Eisenberg a Night on the Town.  The goal: ending Eisenberg's miserable virginity.  However, perhaps the real goal for Scott is to indulge in that supreme privilege that only belongs to uncles: teaching those miserable nephews all about life, because, as we all know, fathers CLEARLY fail in that particular task.  The definition of &#34;pedagogy&#34; is the &#34;art and science of education&#34;; but when it comes to the art of teaching teenage boys about manhood, pedagogy can also be defined as the art of feeding the vanity of the teacher, and what a delicious feast it is.  Three cheers for uncles!Scott has a monologue, amusing and bitter in equal parts, for every occasion, and most of them have elements of uncomfortable truth.  He's far too intelligent to be stupid in his misanthropy; his points are hard to argue with.  We meet him at a personal nadir: the keen intelligence and world-weary experience starts turning on him, eating him from the inside.  Inevitably, the venom thus generated spills onto a few innocent bystanders.  The movie is designed to demonstrate that even the fiercest intelligence becomes hollow without the ameliorating salve of compassion and tender feeling, which is usually engendered by family relations, particularly children -- hence Eisenberg.  It's not an accident that Scott is disassociated from his family; the movie's business is to change that dynamic, and I think that it does so pretty convincingly, although I wonder if a scuzzy underground whorehouse was necessary to provide that &#34;crisis point&#34;, as they say in screenwriting school.  But perhaps it was: Scott is a lost soul, sick of himself, sick of life, drinking too much, past his prime.  Audiences may debate whether his soul is worth saving, but I think it is worth saving.  In a world of gullible stupidity, clear-eyed intelligence is always welcome, and to watch it slowly spiral down the drain is tragic.  And boy is Scott smart, smarter than most of us.  For example: in a &#34;quartet&#34; scene in the park with Elizabeth Berkley and Jennifer Beals, he appears to implode with self-sabotaging dialogue that's insulting to the women, but he immediately shows us up when it turns out to be a &#34;good-cop / bad cop&#34; routine in order to get Eisenberg another chance with Beals.  Welcome to family values, playah-style.  Does such intelligence deserve a tragic ending?  Isn't the mind a terrible thing to waste?Ultimately, the character of &#34;Roger&#34; is better than his movie, and Campbell Scott brings him to life with a remorselessly intelligent portrayal and a serpentine voice.

I was only half right. During the set up we actually find out that he's sort of a prick. If he likes you he uses his elocutionary skills flatter you. If he's having a bad day he using them to debase you. Then his 16 yr. old nephew enters the picture & asks for help with the ladies. Normally he might not ""waste"" his time in helping another human being, but I believe it creates a nice distraction from the current turbulation in his life. This film primarily takes place during one night. Scott BSs his way throughout the evening trying to teach his nephew a thing or 2. They interact with a couple of chicks at a bar, Elizabeth Berkley who I enjoy & Jennifer Beals who I find highly overrated. They like the boy's naivetivity. Scott then continues the night trying to get the boy laid while the night gets seamier & seamier. There is definitely some truthfullness in this movie, such as when Scott tells his nephew about the closing time scenario in which everyone gets depressed & just don't want to be alone. In the end it seems that the nephew may have learned a thing or 2 even though he'd probably retain his sweetness. Scott may or may not change, but I think it's more about the scene & lonliness than any one or 2 characters. This film really does seem to push you into the movie.

By the end of the film, you want to take a shower and crawl into bed to get some rest.The Roger of the title is a womanizing scumball brainiac whose speech is as highly controlled as his love life is absolutely out of control. This shark loves the ladies, to a fault; by mentally assassinating them before making any kind of move, he ruins his chances continuously. You can see this routine might of work with younger, unsuspecting college girls, but as Roger is aging, the act is failing. Ironically, his nephew shows up to seek advice about the ladies, so Roger spends most of the film poisioning this young lad's mind about the ways of the love world, possibly validating the claim: &quot;Those who can't anymore, teach.&quot;Roger is expertly played by Campbell Scott, a highly undervalued actor in cinema today. He walks the fine line between making Roger just scumbag enough to abhor him, and brings a remarkable vulnerability to him at the right times. Equally compelling is Jennifer Beals as a temporary seductress to nephew Nick, and yes, Elizabeth Berkley shines (it's time we get over Showgirls). The successful script, combined with the great cast, make for a great movie experience.One problem I have is with the overuse of the &quot;shaky camera&quot;, which the filmmakers immediately defend in their commentary and bonus features tracks. When I first saw &quot;Roger Dodger&quot; in the theater, I almost felt, fearing motion sickness with the shaky cam. But soon, I fell into it and didn't notice it as much. At home, the reaction is similiar, but somehow, more jarring. Some scenes are almost unwatchable with the shakiness.  I appreciate the reason why they chose that method, but find it to take away from the impact of some scenes. &quot;Shaky cam&quot; is okay, but sometimes, this is &quot;earthquake cam&quot;.Overall, Roger Dodger carries well.

He really believes what he is saying.After he is dumped by his lover, who happens to be his boss, Roger returns to his office at work and finds his nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) standing there, waiting.  With a little bit of prompting, Roger takes Nick out on the town with the intent on teaching Nick about women and to help Nick with his first ""conquest"".  What we have is a mixing of Nick's hesitant, nervous innocence with Roger's scorn, confidence, and perhaps even distaste for women as anything but an object to acquire.Considering what the subject matter is, I did not expect to like this movie very much.  I was surprised.  The dialogue is sharp, and it is easy to see why this movie was produced, the screenplay must have been a real gem to find.

607958,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00005JLX8,Lleu Christopher,"[4, 6]","Roger Dodger is a sharp, insightful and often funny study of a man who is too smooth for his own good. We first meet Roger (Campbell Scott, in a superb role) entertaining a group of friends over cocktails; he dominates the conversation with a clever but absurd argument on the future roles of the sexes. Roger's monologue on the impending irrelevance of the male sex suggests right off the bat that this would-be womanizer suffers from an inferiority complex. As the film progresses, we see that Roger is never out of character; he is always ""on,"" whether at his job (appropriately enough, he's an advertising copyrighter) or trying to seduce a woman. If there is an inner core to this quintessential single, big city pick-up artist, we never see it. The problem is, Roger's smooth, cynical style doesn't really work; more often than not, he offends rather than impresses. This is made clear when he tries to woo a woman in a bar away from her date by guessing that she is being used and exploited by her womanizing boss. This is only a minor conversation in the film, but it takes on an ironic meaning when we learn that the girlfriend who recently dumped Roger (played by Isabella Rossellini) is his boss. We start to suspect at this point that Roger, despite his suave persona, is more victim than predator. When Roger's sixteen year old nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) arrives in town, Roger sees an opportunity to vicariously test his techniques. Nick is a sensitive and somewhat shy teenager anxious for sexual experience; he naively believes Roger to be an expert in this area. When Roger and Nick go out on the town to meet women, the results are often tragically comic. The limited success they have is due to Nick's charm rather than Roger's off-putting worldliness. One of the best things about Roger Dodger is that it avoids falling into some obvious cliches. Writer/director Dylan Kidd could have, for example, turned the story into a neat reversal where the innocent but wiser Nick teaches Roger about the true meaning of love. At the conclusion, it's less than clear who has learned what or if anyone has drastically changed. Campbell Scott avoids making Roger into a complete caricature. While he is certainly slimy and superficial, he is not wrong about everything. It's worth noting that some of the good impressions made by Nick could not have been achieved without Roger's bravado. The film's final scene, in which Roger talks to Nick and some of his high school friends, perfectly encapsulates Roger and the film. We are left with the feeling that Nick, though too smart to put Roger on a pedestal, has probably learned a thing or two from him all the same.",4,Portrait of a pick-up artist,1050105600,"04 12, 2003",2003,2676,"['Roger', 'Dodger', 'sharp', 'insightful', 'often', 'funny', 'study', 'man', 'who', 'too', 'smooth', 'own', 'good', 'first', 'meet', 'Roger', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'superb', 'role', 'entertaining', 'group', 'friends', 'cocktails', 'conversation', 'clever', 'absurd', 'argument', 'future', 'roles', 'sexes', 'Roger', 'monologue', 'impending', 'irrelevance', 'male', 'sex', 'right', 'bat', 'would-be', 'womanizer', 'suffers', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'film', 'see', 'Roger', 'never', 'character', 'always', 'job', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'advertising', 'copyrighter', 'trying', 'seduce', 'woman', 'inner', 'core', 'quintessential', 'single', 'big', 'city', 'pick-up', 'artist', 'never', 'see', 'problem', 'Roger', 'smooth', 'cynical', 'style', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'rather', 'impresses', 'made', 'clear', 'when', 'woo', 'woman', 'bar', 'away', 'date', 'guessing', 'being', 'used', 'exploited', 'womanizing', 'boss', 'only', 'minor', 'conversation', 'film', 'ironic', 'meaning', 'when', 'learn', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'recently', 'dumped', 'Roger', 'played', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'boss', 'start', 'suspect', 'point', 'Roger', 'suave', 'persona', 'more', 'victim', 'predator', 'When', 'Roger', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'nephew', 'Nick', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'town', 'Roger', 'opportunity', 'vicariously', 'test', 'techniques', 'Nick', 'sensitive', 'somewhat', 'shy', 'teenager', 'anxious', 'sexual', 'experience', 'naively', 'Roger', 'be', 'expert', 'area', 'When', 'Roger', 'Nick', 'go', 'out', 'town', 'meet', 'women', 'results', 'are', 'often', 'tragically', 'comic', 'limited', 'success', 'have', 'due', 'Nick', 'charm', 'rather', 'Roger', 'off-putting', 'worldliness', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'Roger', 'Dodger', 'falling', 'obvious', 'cliches', 'Writer/director', 'Dylan', 'Kidd', 'could', 'have', 'example', 'turned', 'story', 'neat', 'reversal', 'where', 'innocent', 'wiser', 'Nick', 'teaches', 'Roger', 'true', 'meaning', 'love', 'conclusion', 'less', 'clear', 'who', 'learned', 'what', 'anyone', 'drastically', 'changed', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'avoids', 'making', 'Roger', 'complete', 'caricature', 'certainly', 'slimy', 'superficial', 'not', 'wrong', 'everything', 'worth', 'noting', 'good', 'impressions', 'made', 'Nick', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'Roger', 'bravado', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'Roger', 'talks', 'Nick', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'perfectly', 'Roger', 'film', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'Nick', 'too', 'smart', 'put', 'Roger', 'pedestal', 'probably', 'learned', 'thing', 'two', 'same']",Roger Dodger

It's kind of like a modern-dayAlfie, but with scenes where Roger takes his virgin cousin to a brothel, amongst other dark scenes.Still, so long as you can stomach such scenes and see past such faults, you will find a first class charactor film that explores dark themes with artistic finesse.Last thing to mention is the extras. Occasionally DVD's offer budding film-makers a full tool-kit of how to make a film.

607961,A3E5VKPVU8LAIT,B00005JLX8,Manolis Vozalis,"[10, 13]","Quentin Tarantino is the most recent director who taught us the importance of a good opening scene for a movie, through classics such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.Dylan Kidd appears to be a very capable student, opening his directorial debut, titled Roger Dodger, with a remarkable scene, a dialogue that actually turns into a monologue of our lead character. In that scene, Roger (Campbell Scott), a successful advertiser and probably equally successful womanizer, states why, according to his beliefs, men will become totally unnecessary for women in the very near future.After such a strong intro, it is a challenge for every director to keep the attention of the viewer at the same level for the rest of the way. Still, Kidd seems to be up to the task, giving us a really absorbing movie. Be warned though: Roger Dodger is a dialogue driven movie. There is not much action here.The film gets started when Roger's nephew (Jesse Eisenberg) suddenly visits, and asks Roger to tell him about the secrets of love - or, if you prefer, to help him get his first sexual experience. Roger will accept the challenge, promising a ""fail safe"" method, and a long night will begin. Their ride includes a visit to a bar where two attractive but also willing to talk women (Elizabeth Berkley, Jennifer Beals) are added to their company, an (uninvited) visit to a party by Roger's employer and ex-girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini), who has made perfectly clear that she does not want to socialize with him any more, and a final surprise visit, where the climax of the film is set.Most of the film's dialogues regard sex and the relations between men and women. Roger's philosophy in advertising is to humiliate people, make them feel bad about themselves, and then offer some kind of product to ""cure"" their unhappiness. In real life, his philosophy is not much different. At least in the first half. Being totally cynical, he won't hesitate to degrade others not taking into consideration their feelings. In some cases, this tactic will give him an advantage, allowing him to find others unprepared and manipulate their weaknesses. In other cases though, things are not that sunny... On the other hand, his nephew, probably because he is still young and inexperienced in life, expresses views that are much more honest and romantic. This, has Roger, his presumable mentor, waiting on the sidelines, not being able to do much.Campbell Scott, who plays Roger, is absolutely convincing. He says all his lines without trying too much. He also shows a considerable amount of charm, which makes him likable, even if we know that this in not the correct reaction toward a character like his. From the supporting roles, only Elizabeth Berkley (Saved by the bell if I remember correctly) is not totally up to the rest cast's high standards, having a tendency to goggle her eyes way too often.Kidd's direction is live, with a penetrating camera that is in constant motion, like the eyes of its main character. That would probably tire a few viewers, but in my humble opinion, fits perfectly with the film's atmosphere.If we would like to locate weaknesses in Roger Dodger, those have nothing to do with the views of our main character. As a matter of fact, Kidd comments indirectly about them, by giving us a glimpse of Roger's personal life. The problem is that the film is concentrated too much on the dialogue, not giving much of a chance to its characters to develop satisfactorily as complete human beings. And that is the case even for Roger. We get to hear a few things about his family, which, if further analyzed, would probably explain his behavior. Still, all those references are left there hanging. And that's a pity.In any case, we forgive Roger because he managed to win us from the opening minute!",4,Roger is cynical but also mysteriously charming,1052697600,"05 12, 2003",2003,3796,"['Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'most', 'recent', 'director', 'who', 'taught', 'importance', 'good', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'classics', 'such', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Pulp', 'Fiction.Dylan', 'Kidd', 'be', 'very', 'capable', 'student', 'opening', 'directorial', 'debut', 'titled', 'Roger', 'Dodger', 'remarkable', 'scene', 'dialogue', 'actually', 'monologue', 'lead', 'character', 'scene', 'Roger', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'successful', 'advertiser', 'probably', 'equally', 'successful', 'womanizer', 'states', 'why', 'according', 'beliefs', 'men', 'will', 'become', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'women', 'very', 'near', 'future.After', 'strong', 'intro', 'challenge', 'director', 'keep', 'attention', 'viewer', 'same', 'level', 'rest', 'way', 'Still', 'Kidd', 'be', 'up', 'task', 'giving', 'really', 'absorbing', 'movie', 'Be', 'warned', 'Roger', 'Dodger', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'action', 'here.The', 'film', 'started', 'when', 'Roger', 'nephew', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'suddenly', 'Roger', 'tell', 'secrets', 'love', 'prefer', 'help', 'get', 'first', 'sexual', 'experience', 'Roger', 'will', 'accept', 'challenge', 'promising', 'fail', 'safe', 'method', 'long', 'night', 'will', 'begin', 'ride', 'visit', 'bar', 'where', 'two', 'attractive', 'also', 'willing', 'talk', 'women', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'are', 'added', 'company', 'uninvited', 'visit', 'party', 'Roger', 'employer', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'who', 'made', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'not', 'want', 'socialize', 'more', 'final', 'surprise', 'visit', 'where', 'climax', 'film', 'set.Most', 'film', 'dialogues', 'regard', 'sex', 'relations', 'men', 'women', 'Roger', 'philosophy', 'advertising', 'humiliate', 'people', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'then', 'offer', 'kind', 'product', 'cure', 'unhappiness', 'real', 'life', 'philosophy', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'Being', 'totally', 'cynical', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'degrade', 'others', 'not', 'taking', 'consideration', 'feelings', 'cases', 'tactic', 'will', 'give', 'advantage', 'allowing', 'find', 'others', 'unprepared', 'manipulate', 'weaknesses', 'other', 'cases', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'sunny', 'other', 'hand', 'nephew', 'probably', 'still', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'life', 'views', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'honest', 'romantic', 'Roger', 'presumable', 'mentor', 'waiting', 'sidelines', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'much.Campbell', 'Scott', 'who', 'Roger', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'lines', 'trying', 'too', 'much', 'also', 'considerable', 'amount', 'charm', 'likable', 'even', 'know', 'not', 'correct', 'reaction', 'character', 'supporting', 'roles', 'only', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley', 'Saved', 'bell', 'remember', 'correctly', 'not', 'totally', 'rest', 'cast', 'high', 'standards', 'having', 'tendency', 'goggle', 'eyes', 'way', 'too', 'direction', 'live', 'penetrating', 'camera', 'constant', 'motion', 'eyes', 'main', 'character', 'would', 'probably', 'tire', 'few', 'viewers', 'humble', 'opinion', 'perfectly', 'film', 'atmosphere.If', 'would', 'like', 'locate', 'weaknesses', 'Roger', 'Dodger', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'views', 'main', 'character', 'matter', 'fact', 'Kidd', 'comments', 'indirectly', 'giving', 'glimpse', 'Roger', 'personal', 'life', 'problem', 'film', 'concentrated', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'not', 'giving', 'much', 'chance', 'characters', 'develop', 'satisfactorily', 'complete', 'human', 'beings', 'case', 'even', 'Roger', 'get', 'hear', 'few', 'things', 'family', 'further', 'analyzed', 'would', 'probably', 'explain', 'behavior', 'Still', 'references', 'are', 'left', 'there', 'hanging', 'pity.In', 'case', 'forgive', 'Roger', 'managed', 'win', 'opening', 'minute']",Roger Dodger

Others may find it abrasive and more than a little offensive. Whatever one's viewpoint, it's hard to deny that Roger Swanson is one memorable character.Roger [Campbell Scott] is a very successful writer at a New York advertising agency. As he puts is, his job is to get people buy things by making them feel bad about themselves. Shrew, fast-talking Roger long ago learned to use the same technique on women. When he meets one he wants, he sizes her up, then begins to say things designed to make her feel that her life needs something. That something is Roger.The bulk of the movie takes place over the course of a day and a night when Roger's manipulative, self-centered world begins to crumble. His latest conquest [Isabella Rossellini], who is also his boss, unceremoniously dumps him in a hilarious scene which shows the great inroads women have made in what used to be exclusively male territory. Then Nick [Jesse Eisenberg], the 16-year old son of his estranged sister in Ohio, shows up. An unexpected bond develops between the two, and soon Roger begins to show the eager lad his technique for getting women. What follows is a series of escapades in which both guys, for better or worse, gets far more than he bargains for.Though the movie takes place in a big city, guys like Roger exist everywhere, and we've all met at least one of them. They are frequently well educated and materially successful, but emotionally they are stuck in their teens. No wonder Roger bonds with Nick. Their maturity levels are about the same.The underrated Scott gives perhaps his best performance to date as pathetic Roger. Eisenberg is touching as the sensitive Nick. The entire supporting cast, which includes Rossellini, Jennifer Beals and Elizabeth Berkley, does a fine job.""Roger Dodger"" is a low budget movie.

Who is he talking to?He talks about Women mostly and he talks to anyone who will listen but in particular his nephew, Nick (Jessie Eisenberg) who has come to NYC to be tutored by his uncle on the broad and fine points of how to pick up women since Nick's Mother (and Roger's sister) has called Roger a ""ladies man."" Roger spends the evening with Nick and so begins Roger and Nick's journey into ""Roger World.""Roger does not talk about love or respect or feelings unless they are to be used as a ruse to get a woman into bed. Roger is neither deep nor caring. Roger is a bitter, smarmy creep. Roger is the blood brother of the Aaron Eckhart character in the film, ""In the Company of Men."" They both lust after women but hate themselves.There is a great sequence in ""Roger Dodger"" involving Roger, Nick (who Roger has snuck into a Bar) and two women: Andrea (Elizabeth Berkley) and Sophie (Jennifer Beals) who Roger has asked to join he and Nick. Andrea and Sophie are smart, sexy, beautiful women who can ""see"" Roger for what he is and who are in turn fascinated by Nick's navet&eacute;. Berkley and Beals have never looked more beautiful nor been as charming as they are in this scene. The director Dylan Kidd wisely, at this point in the narrative, lets some hot air out of the bag that is Roger with this delightful scene and we feel some relief, if only for a few minutes, from Roger's unrelenting chatter.Dylan Kidd has taken some major gambles with ""Roger Dodger"": what if we had merely walked out or tuned off to this film? This very easily could have happened with an anti-hero, buffoon as his lead character. And don't think for a moment that Roger ""sees the light"" and repents. Not in the least. Campbell Scott makes the most of Roger: watch his eyes, his way of lighting his cigarette and the manner in which he smokes it. This guy is committed to making Roger as repellant yet believable as possible.

Fun because the script is tight and the acting top notch and you know from the start you are in the hands of a good director. Just the kind of thing you want from a night at an art house: not a message movie like many such films but instead in-your-face film making - and three cheers for that. Campbell Scott plays the smooth player who tutors his nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) on how to get laid. The action takes place mostly in one night of bar and party hopping. This script is so good that any bar lizard could learn from the lines and strategy used by Scott's character. Scott's character is an accomplished and dedicated player who never sees the wrong in his ways and that is the delicious and honest part of the film. One review talked about the player venting his anger at women but my take was that he stayed in control the entire movie, venting naturally (and within limits) when he was thrown over by his boss/lover. Like him or hate him, the player is a pro from beginning to end. The viewer has to decide whether he likes or dislikes women.

His boss breaks off their relationship the same day his teenaged nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) shows up seeking Roger's advice on sex and romance. Roger and Nick set out to find Nick a woman using Roger's finely-honed method of operation. Through a series of womanizing  episodes in bars and brothels, the depth of Roger's emotional dysfunction and self-loathing are revealed. Even as Roger is in many ways repulsive, he is also energetic, witty and ultimately at least partially redeemed.Campbell Scott's portrayal of Roger Swanson's conglomeration of fierce intelligence, acute self-loathing and borderline alcoholism was one of the finest performances of 2002. I find  that the greatest performances involve an impeccable sense of timing on the part of the actor. Campbell Scott's flawless timing combined with emotional transparency and palpable energy make this performance extraordinary. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Roger Dodger also boasts an excellent supporting cast. Jesse Eisenberg is perfect as sweet, hapless, but eager-to-learn Nick. Isabella Rossallini, Elizabeth Berkley, and Jennifer Beals make solid contributions as Roger's boss and two women whom Roger and Nick try to pick up, respectively.Roger Dodger doesn't contain any action or romance, and its humor is strictly sardonic.

This is what hold yours attention as there are significantly long periods of meandering dialogue in Roger Dodger between the action and drama that unfolds. Also, the director doesn't impose himself on the characters or scenes, instead he leaves it up to the viewer to soak it all in and draw their own conclusions, this is helped by the way it is filmed, the camera moving around casually, sometimes jerkily as though you are eavesdropping in on Roger's interludes with people.

607978,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLX8,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 8]","Roger Swanson is a coldhearted, fast-talking yuppie businessman who has cynically reduced the man-woman equation to its Darwinian essentials.  To Roger, women are objects to be conquered not people to be respected, and he has learned to employ his good looks, charm and over-analytical mind in the service of getting laid.  When Nick, his nave, inexperienced 16-year old nephew comes to town, Roger decides to train the boy in the fine art of manipulation and seduction, taking him out for a night on the town that the youngster will not soon forget.As conceived by first time writer/director Dylan Kidd, ""Roger Dodger"" is less a full-fledged narrative and more a series of extended conversations.  And I, for one, couldn't be happier, for the dialogue Kidd has come up with is sharp, observant, insightful and witty, as Roger opens up and reveals his unique perspective on the dating scene.  He uses his mouth like a machine gun, shooting rounds of rapid-fire, staccato comments, indifferent to who's left standing when he's done.  He really has no qualms about ""corrupting"" his underage nephew, never seeing or caring about the corrosive effect he may be having on him.  In the process, we learn quite a bit about Roger as a person, most especially the aloofness he feels from others and his inability to make any kind of emotional connection that really works.  Long estranged from his father and sister, Roger is also facing a breakup with the older woman he's recently come to fancy (his boss in fact).  Roger is a humorous figure but also an immensely sad one, for he really does seem - for all his bravado and bluster to the contrary - to be a lonely, unhappy guy.  We are simultaneously drawn to him by his confidence and charisma and repelled by his smarminess and coldness, just like the characters in the film.  As Roger, Campbell Scott does a superb job bringing out both of those seemingly contradictory qualities.  A non-stop talker, Roger knows how to draw all the attention in the room to himself; he is (at the risk of mixing my metaphors here) like a chattering vortex up there on the screen and we can't help but be sucked in by his personality and presence.  No wonder Scott won the 2002 award for Best Actor from the National Board of Review.  In fact, I haven't seen a performance this smooth, alive and energetic in a very long time.  Equally impressive is young Jesse Eisenberg whose wide-eyed innocence and youthful decency provide an effective counterpoint to the brash but empty Roger.  Isabella Rossellini, Elizabeth Berkley and Jennifer Beals also turn in outstanding performances as the various ladies who play a part in the two men's adventure.In his debut film, Kidd shows himself to be in full control of his medium.  He employs a jittery, handheld camera in almost every scene, a technique that may bother some people but which heightens the sense of realism so essential to the nature of the story.  In this way, the audience is made to feel almost like an eavesdropper on the various conversations.  Kidd should also be commended - in this day of maximum special effects and minimal verbiage - for allowing his characters to speak at great length on any number of topics.  Many another filmmaker would have felt intimidated by such a heavy reliance on dialogue.  Kidd, obviously, feels intoxicated by the beauty of language and his intoxication becomes ours.Roger is a fascinating case study mainly because we feel so ambivalent in our attitude towards him.  Just as we are about to consign him to the category of heartless, cold-blooded bastard, he wins us over by showing us that barest glimmer of humanity that peeks out every so often from beneath his well-oiled exterior.""Roger Dodger"" is not only an intriguing, amusing and poignant tale of realtionships and sex in the modern world, but a confident first film that augurs well for its gifted young maker.",4,The Artful Roger,1060387200,"08 9, 2003",2003,3897,"['Roger', 'Swanson', 'coldhearted', 'fast-talking', 'yuppie', 'businessman', 'who', 'cynically', 'reduced', 'man-woman', 'equation', 'Darwinian', 'essentials', 'Roger', 'women', 'are', 'objects', 'be', 'conquered', 'not', 'people', 'be', 'respected', 'learned', 'employ', 'good', 'looks', 'charm', 'over-analytical', 'mind', 'service', 'getting', 'laid', 'When', 'Nick', 'nave', 'inexperienced', '16-year', 'old', 'nephew', 'town', 'Roger', 'train', 'boy', 'fine', 'art', 'manipulation', 'seduction', 'taking', 'out', 'night', 'town', 'youngster', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'forget.As', 'conceived', 'first', 'time', 'writer/director', 'Dylan', 'Kidd', 'Roger', 'Dodger', 'less', 'full-fledged', 'narrative', 'more', 'series', 'extended', 'conversations', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'dialogue', 'Kidd', 'come', 'up', 'sharp', 'observant', 'insightful', 'witty', 'Roger', 'up', 'reveals', 'unique', 'perspective', 'dating', 'scene', 'mouth', 'machine', 'gun', 'shooting', 'rounds', 'rapid-fire', 'staccato', 'comments', 'indifferent', 'who', 'left', 'standing', 'when', 'done', 'really', 'qualms', 'corrupting', 'underage', 'nephew', 'never', 'seeing', 'caring', 'corrosive', 'effect', 'may', 'be', 'having', 'process', 'learn', 'quite', 'bit', 'about', 'Roger', 'person', 'most', 'especially', 'aloofness', 'others', 'inability', 'make', 'kind', 'emotional', 'connection', 'really', 'Long', 'estranged', 'father', 'sister', 'Roger', 'also', 'facing', 'breakup', 'older', 'woman', 'recently', 'come', 'fancy', 'boss', 'fact', 'Roger', 'humorous', 'figure', 'also', 'immensely', 'sad', 'one', 'really', 'seem', 'bravado', 'bluster', 'contrary', 'be', 'lonely', 'unhappy', 'guy', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'drawn', 'confidence', 'charisma', 'repelled', 'smarminess', 'coldness', 'just', 'characters', 'film', 'Roger', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'superb', 'job', 'bringing', 'out', 'seemingly', 'contradictory', 'qualities', 'non-stop', 'talker', 'Roger', 'how', 'draw', 'attention', 'room', 'risk', 'mixing', 'metaphors', 'here', 'chattering', 'vortex', 'up', 'there', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'sucked', 'personality', 'presence', 'wonder', 'Scott', 'won', '2002', 'award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'National', 'Board', 'Review', 'fact', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'performance', 'smooth', 'alive', 'energetic', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'young', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'wide-eyed', 'innocence', 'youthful', 'decency', 'provide', 'effective', 'counterpoint', 'brash', 'empty', 'Roger', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkley', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'also', 'turn', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'various', 'ladies', 'who', 'play', 'part', 'two', 'men', 'adventure.In', 'debut', 'film', 'Kidd', 'be', 'full', 'control', 'medium', 'jittery', 'handheld', 'camera', 'almost', 'scene', 'technique', 'may', 'bother', 'people', 'sense', 'realism', 'so', 'essential', 'nature', 'story', 'way', 'audience', 'made', 'feel', 'almost', 'eavesdropper', 'various', 'conversations', 'Kidd', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'commended', 'day', 'maximum', 'special', 'effects', 'minimal', 'verbiage', 'allowing', 'characters', 'speak', 'great', 'length', 'number', 'topics', 'Many', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'intimidated', 'heavy', 'reliance', 'dialogue', 'Kidd', 'obviously', 'feels', 'intoxicated', 'beauty', 'language', 'intoxication', 'ours.Roger', 'fascinating', 'case', 'study', 'mainly', 'feel', 'so', 'ambivalent', 'attitude', 'Just', 'are', 'consign', 'category', 'heartless', 'cold-blooded', 'bastard', 'over', 'showing', 'barest', 'glimmer', 'humanity', 'out', 'so', 'often', 'well-oiled', 'exterior', 'Roger', 'Dodger', 'not', 'only', 'intriguing', 'amusing', 'poignant', 'tale', 'realtionships', 'sex', 'modern', 'world', 'confident', 'first', 'film', 'well', 'gifted', 'young', 'maker']",Roger Dodger

He knows what makes them tick, why they are the way they are; from the way they wear their hair, the shoes they picked out or the look in their eyes. Roger has mastered the art of knowing women, what they think they're hiding deep down; and he blows his own horn about the very fact quite masterfully, and frequently. When his boss Joyce(Isabella Rossellini) breaks off their secret affair, Roger is angered and convinced she will change her mind and return immediately to his highly intelligent self.A wrench gets thrown into Roger's routine when his 16 year old nephew Nick(Jesse Eisenberg) shows up in his office, hoping to spend some quality time with his absent uncle.  Nick's your typical high school outcast, inexperienced, shy and naive; the complete opposite of his uncle Roger. So when Nick asks his uncle to teach him how he acquires the attention of so many women, he just might not be ready for the abstract knowledge that is about to spew from Roger's salacious unconscious.""You drink that drink! Alcohol has been a social lubricant for thousands of years. What do you think, you're going to sit here tonight and reinvent the wheel?""After bombarding young Nick with a truly brilliant monologue on the ravenous city streets, we find this twosome in a bar where Roger hits Nick with the nights' first challenge; converse with two beautiful older women Andrea(Elizabeth Berkley) and Sophie(Jennifer Beals) on the premise that they've made a bet for a thousand dollars; that Nick cannot get a woman to fall in love with him that very night.This movie has its awkward moments, sometimes I just wanted to yell at little Nick(""get out of there! I feel embarrassed for you!"") and the reoccurring music is a little on the cheesy side, but overall this film is very intelligent.Campbell Scott is brilliant as Roger, although the cast is great, he alone carries this film to a new level entirely. His ongoing rants and insight into the female mystique, not to mention his arrogance should really make us dislike him, but something in his portrayal is too sincere, and we see when the tables are turned that even Roger can be hurt.I commend this film and it's ability to juxtapose it's two main characters so beautifully, leaving so many questions to be asked. Is it better to be overly aware, or blissfully ignorant?

After the smartly written opening scene though, I was pleasantly surprised and I was on board for the rest of the film. At the risk of contradicting myself, I normally don't like dialouge driven independent film, particularly set in an urban setting such as Manhattan. Nothing against NYC, it's just they tend to confuse pontification and philosophy as substance for character. However the writer/director manages to get his ideas across with out preaching, making for a highly watchable film. There is a slight pretension to this movie, but only because it is encapsulated in the main character, Roger, played brilliantly by Campbell Scott. I've always liked watching Scott and he does not dissappoint. He gives a performance that will hopefully get him noticed again. And it's balanced wonderfully by Jesse Eisenberg, who plays his nephew that looks to Roger to educate him in manners of the opposite sex.The other thing that I liked about this film is the pace. This is ""A Night in the Life"" premise but it moves quickly and you really don't realize your watching that type of movie until after it's over. The hook that keeps you watching is not only Scotts performance, but wondering if the nephew is going to lose his virginity.The only critizism I have of the film is that it's shot entirely hand held. The style lends itself well to the film, but I would love to see what this director does with a steadycam.You don't ""Gotta see this movie!"" but it's an intellegent distraction with a unique charm.
