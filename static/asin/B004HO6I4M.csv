1409093,AMGU3JP1CHFAC,B004HO6I4M,"Alan H. Markow ""a/vguy""","[0, 0]","Rio is a beautifully rendered film that is made more spectacular with its 3-D effects.  While clearly designed to delight children, it also provides plenty of pleasure for adults through its character development and clever turns of phrase.  The boy-meet-girl story is told on two levels:  the two rare birds -- one from the city and one from spectacular Rio -- and the two adults -- a shy, but knowing, woman who owns the city bird and a smart, but nerdy botanist who has re-located from the States to Rio in order to study the colorful birds found in the rainforest.  The samba rhythms keep the music from becoming cloying and, in fact, add some fine touches.One of the movie's best features is the menagerie (literally) of second fiddles and bit players who waddle or fly --sometimes awkwardly and other times with soaring grace.  It's a cartoon, so most of the good guys are genuinely good, while the bad guys might as well be wearing black hats because their evilness is so totally transparent (even when they're pretending to be good guys).  But it does bring up a good point about the illegal poaching of rare birds from the rain forests and the willingness of wealthy clients to buy them despite threats of species extinction.  Rio shifts into darker color schemes when it enters the lair of the bad guys, so in case you missed the point of where bad vs. good is occurring, the film makes it perfectly clear.  The villain bird is a conniving liar who always looks like he needs a bath and flies awkwardly.  He's a total contrast with the good hearted birds who are both colorful and beautiful to watchBut the movie's strongest feature has to be the music, which beats with a Brazilian heart throughout the film, and provides the opportunity for some spectacular dancing numbers.  My only proviso is that the film pays some obvious tribute to Disney pictures such as Lion King in its biggest number (again, Lion King comes to mind).  But the numbers are well-done so you quickly forget that it's all been done before, and concentrate instead of the colorful birds and the heart-warming story.  Another highly successful element of the film is its portrayal of the Carnivale parade with its gorgeous animated floats and gyrating dancers moving to the rhythm of Rio.I saw the film in 3D, and the effects were both excellent and subtle enough to keep the film from falling into overdone 3-D cliches. It's worthwhile wearing the glasses to see this one.  have a feeling that you wouldn't miss 3-D if you only purchase the 2-D Blu-Ray, but once you've seen it in 3-D there's simply no going back.  On my projector/screen combo, Rio was bright and beautiful with memorable moments throughout.  And since the samba beat was the glue that held it all together, a good sound system really pays off.We never see anyone heading for the gym, but the heroine is in remarkably good physical condition for a gal from Minnesota who runs a barely successful pet store.  But, honestly, who cares about such details.  It's a fun movie and I can't wait to show it to my grandchildren.",4,Colorful and Funny,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,3071,"['Rio', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'film', 'made', 'more', 'spectacular', '3-D', 'effects', 'clearly', 'designed', 'delight', 'children', 'also', 'plenty', 'pleasure', 'adults', 'character', 'development', 'clever', 'turns', 'phrase', 'boy-meet-girl', 'story', 'told', 'two', 'levels', 'two', 'rare', 'birds', 'one', 'city', 'one', 'spectacular', 'Rio', 'two', 'adults', 'shy', 'knowing', 'woman', 'who', 'city', 'bird', 'smart', 'nerdy', 'botanist', 'who', 're-located', 'States', 'Rio', 'order', 'study', 'colorful', 'birds', 'found', 'rainforest', 'samba', 'rhythms', 'keep', 'music', 'becoming', 'cloying', 'fact', 'add', 'fine', 'touches.One', 'movie', 'best', 'features', 'menagerie', 'literally', 'second', 'fiddles', 'bit', 'players', 'who', 'waddle', 'fly', 'sometimes', 'awkwardly', 'other', 'times', 'soaring', 'grace', 'cartoon', 'most', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'genuinely', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'wearing', 'black', 'hats', 'evilness', 'so', 'totally', 'transparent', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'pretending', 'be', 'good', 'guys', 'bring', 'up', 'good', 'point', 'illegal', 'poaching', 'rare', 'birds', 'rain', 'forests', 'willingness', 'wealthy', 'clients', 'buy', 'threats', 'species', 'extinction', 'Rio', 'shifts', 'darker', 'color', 'when', 'lair', 'bad', 'guys', 'so', 'case', 'missed', 'point', 'where', 'bad', 'vs.', 'good', 'occurring', 'film', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'villain', 'bird', 'conniving', 'liar', 'who', 'always', 'bath', 'flies', 'awkwardly', 'total', 'contrast', 'good', 'hearted', 'birds', 'who', 'are', 'colorful', 'beautiful', 'watchBut', 'movie', 'strongest', 'feature', 'be', 'music', 'Brazilian', 'heart', 'film', 'opportunity', 'spectacular', 'dancing', 'numbers', 'only', 'proviso', 'film', 'obvious', 'tribute', 'Disney', 'pictures', 'such', 'Lion', 'King', 'biggest', 'number', 'again', 'Lion', 'King', 'mind', 'numbers', 'are', 'well-done', 'quickly', 'forget', 'been', 'done', 'concentrate', 'instead', 'colorful', 'birds', 'heart-warming', 'story', 'highly', 'successful', 'element', 'film', 'portrayal', 'Carnivale', 'parade', 'gorgeous', 'animated', 'floats', 'gyrating', 'dancers', 'moving', 'rhythm', 'Rio.I', 'saw', 'film', '3D', 'effects', 'were', 'excellent', 'subtle', 'enough', 'keep', 'film', 'falling', 'overdone', '3-D', 'cliches', 'worthwhile', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'see', 'one', 'have', 'feeling', 'would', ""n't"", 'miss', '3-D', 'only', 'purchase', '2-D', 'Blu-Ray', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', '3-D', 'simply', 'going', 'back', 'projector/screen', 'combo', 'Rio', 'was', 'bright', 'beautiful', 'memorable', 'moments', 'samba', 'beat', 'was', 'glue', 'held', 'together', 'good', 'sound', 'system', 'really', 'off.We', 'never', 'see', 'anyone', 'heading', 'gym', 'heroine', 'remarkably', 'good', 'physical', 'condition', 'gal', 'Minnesota', 'who', 'barely', 'successful', 'pet', 'store', 'honestly', 'who', 'such', 'details', 'fun', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'show', 'grandchildren']",Rio

Some people have what it takes to give a voice performance, and many others don&#8217;t.  The real star here is obviously Jemaine Clement though, who voices the dastardly Nigel.

1409109,A25BZHDKHNGD1D,B004HO6I4M,Angelica C. Driskell,"[2, 3]","I want to go to Rio de Janeiro!  Rio is an exuberant CGI animated 3D film with wonderfully vibrant colors that literally jump off the screen.  This is a classic fish out of water story filled with romance, life lessons and a fairly predictable ending.  Nevertheless, Rio is a truly enjoyable film and nearly impossible to watch without dancing in your seat.  Director Carlos Saldanha incorporates a tremendous amount of the Brazilian culture into the film and realistic landscape; it is very easy to forget this is an animation.  In particular, the flight scenes offer spectacular bird's eye views of the exotic Rio de Janeiro setting.  Breathtaking scenery filled with rich, warm colors is incredibly detailed and mesmerizing.Although the themes are familiar, the characters are engaging and loveable.  Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) is a domesticated macaw from a small-town who embarks on an adventure in Rio de Janeiro with native, Jewel (Anne Hathaway) to save endangered animals.  Credit goes to the writers for providing a sharp, witty dialog and the voice actors for bringing the animated characters to life.  In addition to the incredible computer generated visuals, the music adds authentic Brazilian flavor and zest.  I love the samba and bossa nova rhythms that pulsate throughout and provide infectious energy.  Rio is not billed as a musical but it definitely has that feel and the music is what makes this fast-paced adventure so enjoyable.  The Carnival festival explodes on the screen with vigor and verve providing a dazzling display of movement and color set perfectly to music.Rio does not have the depth of some other animated stories; however, it is pure fun from beginning to end.

1409116,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B004HO6I4M,Armando N. Roman,"[5, 7]","Rio seemed to stay in theaters longer than any non-Pixar animated movie in recent memory. I was actually surprised each week when I'd check the weekly box office scores and see Rio still in the top 5, week after week. The movie must've done something right, right? Well, I think the main reason it stuck around so long was because it was pretty much the only family movie out at the time. I recently finished the movie, and while it took me 5 sittings to get through the whole thing, I'll be honest and say that while I definitely didn't like it, it's still better than some other recent family movies (Hop, I'm lookin' at you). Rio just doesn't have much going for it aside from a colorful cast of characters and most of the focus being on the birds. A lot of the jokes fall flat, there's not much danger from the villains, and most of the actors chosen to do the voices shouldn't have been anywhere near this movie. But hey, at least George Lopez isn't doing his usual 'ayyyyy! I'm Mexican, we all talk like-a deeeeees! Low Riders!' here.The movie starts out with a baby blue macaw waking up in the rain forest of Rio de Janeiro as hundreds of birds dance and sing happily. Within minutes, they're caught by poachers and shipped off to who knows where, but the little macaw's crate falls off the truck in the middle of Minnesota of all places. A little girl named Linda saves him, and raises him as her own pet, naming him Blue. Blue never learns how to fly, but doesn't need to since he's efficient at walking and climbing, so he's set. Years pass and Linda's in her late teens or early 20s, when a man from Brazil shows up to her book store and wants to take Linda and Blue with him, where Blue will be paired up with the only other surviving blue macaw, where they'll save their species. Linda agrees, but once they make it back to Rio, where Carnival is starting, Blue is once again taken by poachers, but this time he's chained to the other macaw, Jewel. She doesn't think highly of him, calling him a pet and irritated by the fact that he can't fly, but they'll have to work together if they're going to escape from the poachers, and especially if they're going to be mates.Yes it's another fish out of water story, and it's another predictable one at that. The cast of characters is as generic as you get: dweeb hero, headstrong girl he's in love with, a knowledgeable sidekick, two goofy buddies, a trio of stooges for the secondary bad guys, and the main bad guy (another bird) with an accent. I didn't care about any of these characters, apart from Jewel, and that's because she's a no-nonsense character that I could at least agree with on how she handled some things. The others were just kinda...there. It didn't help that the voice actors barely put any effort into their lines, especially Jemaine Clement as Nigel, the evil bird. Even during his song, Jemaine sounds bored. It made me wonder why more actors didn't take a lesson from Jeremy Irons when he sang Scar's 'Be Prepared' in The Lion King. The other voice actors, including Tracy Morgan and will.i.am (ugh) play such stereotypes that it was borderline offensive. It seemed like will.i.am was just brought into the movie so he could show off a few sound effects he could do vocally, act 'street' and that was it. and Leslie Mann as a young girl? I don't even need to comment on that one. Enough with the voices though, as much as it bothered me, because the other main problem is that things are just so light. The problems the heroes get into are resolved in no time, and like I said, the villains don't pose much of a threat. Jewel's never intimidated by Nigel, who towers over her, and has no problem making the first move. If anything, Nigel's just a jerk, nothing more.  At the same time, and I know I'm contradicting myself here, I'm kind of glad it took the light route and didn't take things too seriously, because they could've easily done that here. The poaching bit was just begging for some kind of forced message, and they didn't do it.Were there things I liked about this movie? Sure. The animation and art direction was beautiful, and while it's not on Pixar or Dreamworks' finest level (How to Train Your Dragon and the Kung Fu Panda movies), the scenes with animals and flying around are a sight to behold. As flat as a lot of the jokes were, there was one that made me laugh out loud a little bit involving a crotch shot where the victim spits out two jewels. Anne Hathaway also did good with what she had to work with, though that's just a sign of a good actress, and she's done voice acting before in The Cat Returns and Hoodwinked. Kids 8 and under will probably be the best audience for Rio, but anyone older won't get much out of it.The blu-ray looks and sounds perfect, that's all there is to it. I don't have any complaints at all with either area, and this is definitely something to show off your new tv with if you want to use an animated film as a demo. You can really see the tiniest details in the trees during the rain forest sequences, and the sound is all over the place during the more hectic bits. The special features are ok, with most of them focusing on music, dance, and the voice actors. I've actually always liked seeing footage of the actors recording their lines, so this was a treat to see. It was also nice that they included Angry Birds Rio, my personal favorite of the Angry Birds games, as it feels more polished than the others, and features characters and levels from the movie. The game was already cheap enough, but getting it for free is cool for people who haven't went for it yet.Had there been better acting, at least to match the facial expressions of the characters, I would've been a little more into the movie. I have to stress that as much as there was that I didn't like about the movie, it's still not bad and there are worse animated movies from the last couple of years that you could pick over this. Rio is a beautiful but flawed movie. Rent it and then decide if you want to spend the money on it.",3,"Well, I didn't hate it.",1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,6040,"['Rio', 'seemed', 'stay', 'theaters', 'longer', 'non-Pixar', 'animated',

Rio begins with Blu a rare macaw as a wee baby bird, who falls out of a tree where he lands softly and is soon scooped up by a poacher. While on a truck with other exotic birds now in the U.S. Blu falls out of the truck and is found by a little girl. This little girl domesticates and raises Blu and as she grows into a woman, Blu blossoms into a handsome grown macaw. The two are inseparable and soon are on their way to Rio when a friend of Blu's owner convinces her to breed Blu with Jewel(Anne Hathaway). Jewel is the female version of Blu who is the last of her kind, soon to be extinct. Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) is quite the character and had me laughing the whole time. Once in Rio Blu doesn't think it is such a good idea to mate, after he meets and speaks to Jewel in a bird lab. Jewel is an angry macaw that has has been trying to escape from this lab and is in no mood for chatting. During the night Jewel and Blu are stolen from the lab, but not without a fight from Jewel and soon their adventure begins. While in Rio, Blu befriends some wise-cracking, smooth talking exotic city birds (including Gorge Lopez),who helps him along the way. But because Blu has never learned how to fly, he is constantly walking while others are flying, which at times gets him and Jewel into some very serious and dangerous situations. The soundtrack throughout Rio is beautiful and so are the effects.

Weak characters, cookie-cutter plot, borderline racism in the presentation of the Brazilian characters and, worst of all, the samba was way, way watered down.  I mean, seriously... if you're going to do a movie set in Brazil, play some real samba music, not the bland R&B; mix this film wallows in.  Also, did Tracy Morgan really have to be the voice of the Brazilian everyman -- er, bird -- gettin' all funky with his natural self and acting all street and spouting all that tacky, dated slang?  Are there no Brazilians to hire for these roles?  Sure, there's hip-hop culture in Brazil, but was it really necessary to present such a North Americanized version of it in an attempt to make this film, I dunno... more accessible to some imaginary version of an American audience that couldn't handle the Brazilians seeming more Brazilian?  It's just one aspect of a general tepidness that drags this film down...

1409164,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004HO6I4M,C. Sawin,"[33, 46]","20th Century Fox has given us the likes of Fantastic Mr. Fox, Horton Hears a Who, and, of course, the Ice Age films as far as animated films go. While I did thoroughly enjoy both Fantastic Mr. Fox and Horton Hears a Who, both films were adapted from novels. Despite usually having stunning animation, original animated films created by 20th Century Fox like Ice Age lack something Pixar films such as Up, WALL-E, Ratatouille, and the Toy Story films utilize in the best of ways. Unfortunately, Rio, despite its best efforts, seems to continue this trend.Rio manages to make its visuals its most cherished attribute. The 3-D animated adventure is intensely rich with spectacular color as every frame of the film is filled with nothing but the most bright and brilliant hues. Calling the film eye candy, in this case, would be nothing more than a compliment for a film like this. It is definitely the most vivid animated film in recent memory. With films these days, everything is so focused on being dark and serious while bright colors are replaced with various shades of gray and gloomy shadows. Rio's dynamic use of color practically makes it a happy film in tone right off the bat and is a welcome change of pace.However, everything else about the film either left something to be desired or was executed improperly. The finale seems to be wrapped up so quickly. It's been building to this moment right here for an hour and a half. For everything to culminate so hastily followed by an even faster epilogue made it all feel very rushed. Rio also doesn't take the necessary steps to build foundation into your emotions either. Every time it touches on a heart wrenching moment for one of the talking animals we've grown attached to, it seems like it jumps back to silly shenanigans too quickly for it to make any sort of impact on you. Then there's the humor of the film that's really touch and go. It'll probably be fun for most kids, but adults weren't the ones filling the theater with uproarious laughter. The animated film's content is more cute or charming than hilarious or groundbreaking.Most of the voices fit the characters really well. Blu is Jesse Eisenberg and vice versa, George Lopez's humor just drips from Rafael's feathers, and Tracy Morgan fits Luiz like a glove. However, Jemaine Clement's voice work for Nigel may have stolen the show. His song is the most enjoyable on the soundtrack and the Nigel character is just one that you love to hate. Also, pretty much any scene involving the thieving marmosets is gold. Those marmosets are to Rio what the penguins are to Madagascar.Rio is both fun and beautifully animated, but the film seems to lack the heart that makes Pixar films so great. 20th Century Fox delivers a film that looks just as good as the best Pixar films, but is only able to scratch the surface of your emotions when it matters most. The humor included in the film seems to fall flat more often than not, as well. It'll make you smirk at times, but nothing is really laugh out loud funny. In the end, Rio is still an amusing animated adventure that's suitable for the entire family but adult viewers may walk away slightly disappointed.",3,"Beautifully animated, but slightly underwhelming",1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,3175,"['20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'given', 'likes', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'Horton', 'Who', 'course', 'Ice', 'Age', 'films', 'as', 'far', 'animated', 'films', 'go', 'did', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'Horton', 'Hears', 'Who', 'films', 'were', 'adapted', 'novels', 'usually', 'having', 'stunning', 'animation', 'original', 'animated', 'films', 'created', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Ice', 'Age', 'lack', 'something', 'Pixar', 'films', 'such', 'Up', 'WALL-E', 'Ratatouille', 'Toy', 'Story', 'films', 'utilize', 'best', 'ways', 'Unfortunately', 'Rio', 'best', 'efforts', 'continue', 'trend.Rio', 'make', 'visuals', 'most', 'cherished', 'attribute', '3-D', 'animated', 'adventure', 'intensely', 'rich', 'spectacular', 'color', 'frame', 'film', 'filled', 'nothing', 'most', 'bright', 'brilliant', 'hues', 'Calling', 'film', 'eye', 'candy', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'compliment', 'film', 'definitely', 'most', 'vivid', 'animated', 'film', 'recent', 'memory', 'films', 'days', 'everything', 'so', 'focused', 'being', 'dark', 'serious', 'bright', 'colors', 'are', 'replaced', 'various', 'shades', 'gray', 'gloomy', 'shadows', 'Rio', 'dynamic', 'use', 'color', 'practically', 'happy', 'film', 'tone', 'right', 'bat', 'welcome', 'change', 'pace.However', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'was', 'executed', 'improperly', 'finale', 'be', 'wrapped', 'up', 'so', 'quickly', 'been', 'building', 'moment', 'right', 'here', 'hour', 'half', 'everything', 'culminate', 'so', 'hastily', 'followed', 'even', 'faster', 'epilogue', 'made', 'feel', 'very', 'rushed', 'Rio', 'also', ""n't"", 'take', 'necessary', 'steps', 'build', 'foundation', 'emotions', 'either', 'time', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'moment', 'one', 'talking', 'animals', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'attached', 'back', 'silly', 'shenanigans', 'too', 'quickly', 'make', 'sort', 'impact', 'Then', 'humor', 'film', 'really', 'touch', 'go', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'fun', 'most', 'kids', 'adults', 'were', ""n't"", 'ones', 'filling', 'theater', 'uproarious', 'laughter', 'animated', 'film', 'content', 'more', 'cute', 'charming', 'hilarious', 'groundbreaking.Most', 'voices', 'fit', 'characters', 'really', 'well', 'Blu', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'vice', 'versa', 'George', 'Lopez', 'humor', 'just', 'drips', 'Rafael', 'feathers', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'Luiz', 'glove', 'However', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'voice', 'work', 'Nigel', 'may', 'have', 'stolen', 'show', 'song', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'soundtrack', 'Nigel', 'character', 'just', 'one', 'love', 'hate', 'Also', 'pretty', 'much', 'scene', 'involving', 'thieving', 'marmosets', 'gold', 'marmosets', 'are', 'Rio', 'what', 'penguins', 'are', 'Madagascar.Rio', 'fun', 'beautifully', 'animated', 'film', 'lack', 'heart', 'Pixar', 'films', 'so', 'great', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'best', 'Pixar', 'films', 'only', 'able', 'scratch', 'surface', 'emotions', 'when', 'most', 'humor', 'included', 'film', 'fall', 'flat', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'as', 'well', ""'ll"", 'make', 'smirk', 'times', 'nothing', 'really', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'end', 'Rio', 'still', 'amusing', 'animated', 'adventure', 'suitable', 'entire', 'family', 'adult', 'viewers', 'may', 'walk', 'away', 'slightly', 'disappointed']",Rio

Rossi,"[6, 6]","Computer animated films from the past 10 or so years have either been super hits based on a terrific storyline and creativity, or have suffered wannabeitis, wanting to be like the best but falling short bigtime. For every Finding Nemo theres at least 3 movies like A Shark's tale. For every Shrek, theres an Unhappily Ever After. Rio is a rare film that falls in the middle, with it being decidedly predominant on the better side of the animation equation.The reason the film works is due in large part to the overall fun aspect of Carnivale in Rio and the strong bond of loyalty Blu has for his owner. Sure its storybook friendship, but here that's ok. There is also that awkwardness of environment background theme going on for blu that clearly borrows from Madagascar, but it's not a beat the joke to death kind of thing. At all the right moments, Blu is simply out of his element making for some cleverly done moments and only on occasion does it get slapsticky, which makes for great surprise laughs you didn't expect.Visually, the movie is a dream to behold. If you have ever wanted to go to Rio, this film will make you want it even more, something that's a pretty lofty acheivement for a kids animated film.What is unfortunate is the over-urban feel at times with characters taking on R & B personas (not surprising since they are voiced by R & B stars) but I am of the mind that a movie doen't have to include a smattering of bad R & B song or lifestyle reminders either hinting at or dead on delivered in an animated film to make it seem more cool. The film succeeds enough in that department on its own merit due to the enormously creative team who put it together. Overall, this urbanization seems misplaced in just about any animated film, yet we are seeing more and more of it sneaking into films where it clearly doesn't belong. I for one, dont go to a movie to hear what I already am surrounded by at all turns on the radio and tv. Movies are supposed to be an escape, a quality becoming more and more left behind each year in ALL films.Still, that one shortcoming aside, Rio is a visually delightful film that does it's best to tell a simple but engaging story that never beats you over the head with 'overkill' moments, especially at the finale. Sometimes, pure fun is all you need, and Rio has plenty of that.

1409184,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004HO6I4M,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 6]","Filmmaker/animator Carlos Saldanha has brought success for Twentieth Century Fox with the various ""Ice Age"" films and while the films have been popular for FOX, many companies are quite competitive when it comes to theatrical films and when it comes to marketing, especially for a big budgeted animated film, you need all the push you can get.And Saldanha's ""Rio"" (budgeted at $90 million) will definitely need that heavy marketing push.With probably one of the most ingenuous collaborations in recent memory Twentieth Century Fox's tie-in with video game company Rovio, the creator of the immensely popular mobile game ""Angry Birds"".Prior to the film, millions of people all over the world got their chance to play ""Angry Birds Rio"", a mobile video  game which has been downloaded over 10 million times.With a successful tie-in with the game and bringing buzz to the animated film, ""Rio"" went on to make $476 million dollars in the box office.  A successful hit and Twentieth Century Fox and Rovio are back again, teaming up for a Blu-ray and DVD release (set for Aug. 2nd) which not only comes with the film on Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy but also has 15 bonus levels for ""Angry Birds Rio"".VIDEO:""Rio"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and is presented in widescreen (2:40:1).  As one would expect from a film that takes place in the jungle and many colorful birds being featured throughout the film, ""Rio"" looks absolutely vibrant on Blu-ray.  Colors galore!  Wonderful detail on the feathers and beaks of the birds, backgrounds and details of rocks to the buildings and even the interiors of the homes look great.If there is one word to describe the picture quality of the film, that word would be ""colorful"".  Expect to see many colors pop throughout the film and for the most part, be content with its awesome picture quality!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Rio"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English descriptive audio 5.1 Dolby Digital, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.The film contains a lot of ambient noises that sound fantastic coming through the surround channels.  It's one thing to have samba musical sequences that sound crystal clear and lively coming from your home theater as there is good use of instruments from surround channels.  Front and center channels showcasing the dialogue and music is also crystal clear.But the film does showcasing excellent ambiance and overall ""Rio"" has a pretty solid lossless soundtrack!Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Rio"" comes with the following special features:Angry Birds Rio Trailer - (1:25) Trailer for ""Angry Birds Rio"".Angry Birds Rio: Nigel Mashup - (2:17) A video featuring Nigel holding the Angry Birds captive.Angry Birds: Exclusive Clue Video - (:29) Featuring a video on how people can obtain things online via a code.Deleted Scene - Fruit Stand - (1:30) A deleted scene (via sketches) with the voice acting.Explore the World of Rio - An interactive tour of Rio (featuring sights and sounds).Saving the Species: One Voice at a Time - (24:49) A featurette on the voice acting fr the film, featuring interviews with the cast and behind-the-scenes look at them recording those scenes.The Real Rio - (9:31) A featurette on how the filmmakers toured Rio as research for the film and the things they got from visiting Rio.The Making of Hot Wings - (8:02) A featurette on Will.i.am and Jamie Foxx recording their scenes for ""Rio"".Boom Boom Tish Tish: The Sound of Brazil - (13:30) Featuring interviews with Diretor Carlos Saldanha, film crew and also with Sergio Mendes and Carlinhos Brown.Carnival Dance-o-Rama - Dance lessons courtesy of the characters from Rio.Welcome to Rio Music Video - (1:37) A music video welcoming people to ""Rio"".Rio de JAM-eiro Jukebox - (8:34) Featuring easy access to the musical sequences from ""Rio"".Taio Cruz - Telling the World Music Video - (1:55) A short music video featuring Taio Cruz.Postcards from Rio - Create your own custom Rio postcard.Theatrical trailer - (2:26) Featuring the theatrical trailer for ""Rio"".EXTRAS:""Rio"" comes with a slipcover case but also flyers to access the Rio ""Coloring with Blu"" app and a secret clue for one to unlock 15 new Rio levels on ""Angry Birds Rio"" via iPhone, iPad or Android.  ""Rio"" on Blu-ray also comes with a DVD and Digital Copy edition of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:There was no doubt in my mind when news broke out that Twentieth Century Fox would be collaborating with Rovio for ""Rio"" that the film would be successful.It hasn't really been done before but its a true testament how the games ""Angry Birds"" on iPhones, Android cell phones and iPads have captured so many people's attention.  My family is absolutely addicted to the game and even to this day, they continue to play ""Angry Birds"", ""Angry Birds Seasons"" and ""Angry Birds Rio"".And for my son and my nephew, because of the tie-in with Angry Birds, before ""Rio"" was shown in theaters, it's all they talked about.  They had to see ""Rio"" and they had to play ""Angry Birds Rio"".So, the collaboration between Twentieth Century Fox and Rovio was fantastic and it's one thing to say that because the film is from the creators of ""Ice Age"" that the film would be a success but lately, animated films are becoming much more competitive and even the big studios have had significant misses as of late for films that they would have expected to be a blockbuster hit.The thing is that with today's economy and the many animated films that are available, the animated films need some major marketing push beyond fast food ""Kids Meals"" and the fact that ""Angry Birds Rio"" is still at this time a continuing game that introduces new gameplay and levels every few months, ""Angry Birds Rio"" is here to stay for now.So, it was no surprise that ""Rio"" did succeed in the box office, it was an incredible collaboration.And sure enough, Twentieth Fox and Rovio has done it once again for this Blu-ray release.  Not only do you get the Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy, there is also ""Angry Birds"" content and also a code to get 15 new levels for ""Angry Birds Rio"".  In fact, prior to my reviewing this Blu-ray release, once the title came up and Angry Birds was shown on the menu, my son and nephew went crazy and wanted to see all the ""Angry Birds"" content first.So, once again, good timing on both companies parts of collaborating once again to grab that ""Angry Birds"" demographic.With that being said, the animated film was definitely fun!  Jesse Eisenberg did a great job at providing the voice of the awkward Blu and Anne Hathaway is just a wonderful actress period and she does a great job voicing the role of Jewel.  And you also get quite a bit of talent participating in this film such as George Lopez, Jamie Foxx, Will.i.am, Wanda Sykes, Jane Lynch, Leslie Mann, Jake T. Austin, etc.The story is fun and enjoyable, colorful and vibrant on Blu-ray.  Also, the audio is wonderful with the music and the use of the ambiance of the environment of the jungle and Rio.And as for special features, there is a good number of them on Blu-ray but while they are not necessarily long, the addition of the ""Angry Birds Rio"" extra levels is a significant plus for the millions of hardcore fans of the game.  So, it gives people an extra incentive to purchase this Blu-ray release.Overall, ""Rio"" is a highly enjoyable, family fun animated film!  The Blu-ray release is absolutely jam-packed and ""Angry Birds Rio"" fans are definitely going to want to pick up ""Rio"" on Blu-ray.Definitely recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: Awesome PQ/AQ and comes with

(The movie is awesome btw, my kids love it!)There is an issue between this blu-ray disc and the PS3. (However in my research it seems systemic to Sony and Samsung players, but I can only validate for the PS3... and YES, I have all the latest firmware updates). The issue is the movie skips periodically through out the entire movie. Interestingly the fix is to disable the internet on the PS3. Under system settings -> Network Settings, select ""Internet"" and select ""Disable"". Among all of my blu-ray discs, this is the only one I've had this problem with. Either the manufactures haven't caught up to new blu-ray software, or this is a bad batch and FOX needs to recall it. I have contacted FOX and complained about the problem, here is the number for anyone else wanting to complain: Call (877)369-7867 to report the problem. I'm going to wait a few weeks and see if a firmware update materializes, otherwise I'll return this for a refund.UPDATE 9/23/2011:A new system update came in for the PS3 (3.72). I applied the update, however it did not fix this problem. Very disappointed. We've decided to keep the movie anyway, but it would be nice to not have to turn off the internet connection every time the movie is played.Also beware; Fox has spread the problem, X-Men: First Class has the same exact issue.",1,PS3 and Blu-Ray Beware!!,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,1371,"['First', 'review', 'blu-ray', 'product', 'not', 'movie', 'movie', 'awesome', 'btw', 'kids', 'love', 'issue', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'PS3', 'However', 'research', 'systemic', 'Sony', 'Samsung', 'players', 'can', 'only', 'validate', 'PS3', 'YES', 'have', 'latest', 'firmware', 'updates', 'issue', 'movie', 'periodically', 'out', 'entire', 'movie', 'Interestingly', 'fix', 'disable', 'internet', 'PS3', 'system', 'settings', '>', 'Network', 'Settings', 'select', 'Internet', 'select', 'Disable', 'blu-ray', 'discs', 'only', 'one', ""'ve"", 'had', 'problem', 'manufactures', 'have', ""n't"", 'caught', 'up', 'new', 'blu-ray', 'software', 'bad', 'batch', 'FOX', 'recall', 'have', 'contacted', 'FOX', 'complained', 'problem', 'here', 'number', 'anyone', 'else', 'wanting', 'complain', 'Call', '877', '369-7867', 'report', 'problem', ""'m"", 'going', 'wait', 'few', 'weeks', 'see', 'firmware', 'update', 'materializes', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'return', 'refund.UPDATE', '9/23/2011', 'new', 'system', 'update', 'came', 'PS3', '3.72', 'applied', 'update', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'fix', 'problem', 'Very', 'disappointed', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'keep', 'movie', 'anyway', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'not', 'have', 'turn', 'off', 'internet', 'connection', 'time', 'movie', 'played.Also', 'beware', 'Fox', 'spread', 'problem', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'same', 'exact', 'issue']",Rio

1409219,AFM9DJYPNM7VT,B004HO6I4M,"Goldencat ""Carla""","[2, 14]","I saw this in theatres, and recently borrowed it from the library.The good: Blu is realistic and so is Jewel. The creators have managed to convey real bird behavior to the big screen, for both the house pet/companion macaw (Blu) and the wild, untrusting of humans (Jewel) one. It's easy to get into the characters because their actions and reactions are so believable as real animals. Just watch a wild bird fly, sometime, and you can catch Jewel's thrill of being able to fly free. there's also real humor in it, as when Blu impersonates his owner's alram clock to wake her up.Colors are great, scenery is vivid, as is the parade in Rio, as busy and gaudy as a real one. so are the costumes of the people in it.Culture and music are portrayed accurately and in detail. Even down to the poverty stricken boy who steals for his boss, to get a little bit of money.The bad. It's terrible for Conservative values, be they Jewish, Muslim, or Christian. Granted, the main characters are BIRDS, and do not naturally have morals. However, this is a humanized cartoon of birds, set in Rio with all the cultural mores of that city. So, we have to look at it as not a documentary - but as entertainment aimed at humans.The music and dancing focus on sex and sensuality, and inspiring desire (even lust) when performed by people in real life. This would lead to ""hooking up"" and illicit sex. It makes little difference that these are cartoons. Blu's friends urge him to be a ""love hawk"" and get his moves on the girl. This repeats through the film. Not values I'd want in my kids! Nor do I want them play acting scenes from the movie. Role play leads to adult behavior later. Free sex may be okay in the Rio singles scene, but not for conservative minded people.There is the bulldog that dances around in a gold foil costume for carnival - a pro-gay offering put into the film? An effeminate dog isn't ""cute"" in my opinion.I also didn't like having yet another ""men-are-stupid"" themed movie.

It's unvaryingly the same - clouds/leaves/trees don't move/change, or do anything but look the same flat 2D. Second hint, is the overuse of repeated shape such as the same bird being used repeatedly in the same scene. Third hint, the overuse of big eyes and mostly eye/mouth movement to sell the character and not much else. Fourth hint, lots of flat plastic like featureless bodies and faces. Even the hair looks and moves like a nylon cleaning duster. Fifth hint, the overall storyboard quality resembled more a 3rd graders attempt at story drawing than a professional work. Witness the difference in animation quality between this movie and Rango. Sometimes animators get too stuck into the animation software so that the end result seems ""too computerish"".Storyline: Same old animal (cat, dot, whatever) ends up with humans either accidentally or via the kidnapped route and faces the challenge of returning home despite bad humans and evil some other critter. Not creative - boring because the same story has been in the studio repeat mode for the past decade or so. The story was too predictable throughout the movie. Just another quick 'n easy dollar as the sole motivation for creating Rio.Script: Simplistic and dumbed down. Nothing intelligent, no allusions, no parodies, just nothing new. Even the music seemed like pointless filler as if the script needed dancing/singing animals to make the story have some energy. To make it worse the dance movements are almost identical to what was used in other animations by this studio.Voices: Bland, no imagination. Voices sounded more like humans, sounding like humans and not the more challenging putting yourself in the place of the critter and imagining how that animal would converse. And the use of a usually wacky African-American urban slang voiced character, which has become incresingly common in animations, borders on racist stereotyping.",1,Saturday Cartoon Quality,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,2015,"['Graphics/animation', 'quality', 'First', 'hint', 'Saturday', 'cartoon', 'level', 'animation', 'background', 'life', 'unvaryingly', 'same', 'clouds/leaves/trees', 'do', ""n't"", 'move/change', 'do', 'anything', 'look', 'same', 'flat', '2D', 'Second', 'hint', 'overuse', 'repeated', 'shape', 'such', 'same', 'bird', 'being', 'used', 'repeatedly', 'same', 'scene', 'Third', 'hint', 'overuse', 'big', 'eyes', 'mostly', 'eye/mouth', 'movement', 'sell', 'character', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Fourth', 'hint', 'lots', 'flat', 'plastic', 'featureless', 'bodies', 'Even', 'hair', 'moves', 'nylon', 'cleaning', 'duster', 'Fifth', 'hint', 'overall', 'storyboard', 'quality', 'resembled', 'more', '3rd', 'graders', 'attempt', 'story', 'drawing', 'professional', 'work', 'difference', 'animation', 'quality', 'movie', 'Rango', 'Sometimes', 'animators', 'get', 'too', 'stuck', 'animation', 'software', 'end', 'result', 'too', 'computerish', '.Storyline', 'Same', 'old', 'animal', 'cat', 'dot', 'up', 'humans', 'accidentally', 'kidnapped', 'route', 'challenge', 'returning', 'home', 'bad', 'humans', 'evil', 'other', 'critter', 'Not', 'creative', 'boring', 'same', 'story', 'been', 'studio', 'repeat', 'mode', 'past', 'decade', 'so', 'story', 'was', 'too', 'predictable', 'movie', 'Just', 'quick', 'n', 'easy', 'dollar', 'sole', 'motivation', 'creating', 'Rio.Script', 'Simplistic', 'dumbed', 'down', 'Nothing', 'intelligent', 'allusions', 'parodies', 'just', 'nothing', 'new', 'Even', 'music', 'seemed', 'pointless', 'filler', 'script', 'needed', 'dancing/singing', 'animals', 'make', 'story', 'have', 'energy', 'make', 'worse', 'dance', 'movements', 'are', 'almost', 'identical', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'other', 'animations', 'studio.Voices', 'Bland', 'imagination', 'Voices', 'sounded', 'more', 'humans', 'sounding', 'humans', 'not', 'more', 'challenging', 'putting', 'place', 'critter', 'imagining', 'how', 'animal', 'would', 'converse', 'use', 'usually', 'wacky', 'African-American', 'urban', 'slang', 'voiced', 'character', 'become', 'incresingly', 'common', 'animations', 'borders', 'racist', 'stereotyping']",Rio

It's full of funny jokes and animals going on adventures, and parents will be happy to know there is hardly any violence. Even though it deals with criminal activities, no one dies and the villains are pretty silly.As far as grown-ups go, adults might like hearing celebrities lend their voices to the characters, as there are a ton of well-known actors included in the cast. The best thing would have to be scenes showing off the city. When the main macaw, Blu, sees the city from a bird's-eye-view for the first time, he was in awe...you might feel the same way. There aren't more than a handful of parts that show off the city's greatness, but I absolutely loved them, and they make me want to go visit Rio in the future.It is quite predictable, which shouldn't be a problem because it's mainly geared toward kids, but I don't think this movie will stick with the older viewers as much as some other recent animated movies likeUp (Single-Disc Edition)andToy Story 3had. The extras on the DVD contained sketches of one deleted scene, and some videos to go with all the music in the movie. I wish there was some commentary from the producers, a game, or even something else in the extras, but I guess that doesn't make me dislike the movie or anything. Also, the ending was a bit rushed. It seemed like the film was just beginning to explore romances between some characters, and then it fast forwarded the story to finish it off.Overall, I liked it.

But no real police work against the smugglers, just a union of the victims and bird lovers to just prevent them from succeeding, in other words to make them fail.The most astonishing side of the film is the luminous vision of Rio de Janeiro and its carnival. If you have never been there go next week and spend some time on the beaches and try to go to the top of the big sugarloaf mountains and meet the Christ standing at the top of the tallest of them. That's a perfect strategy for an emergent country today that has been the target of the latest but not last crisis and that has been able to get out of it even stronger than before. Conquer the world not only with money, certainly not with weapons and bombs, but with culture. That's how the Americans did it after World War II.That's a lesson to us, in the developed countries too. We take for granted that our languages and our cultures are dominant, and they are not. In a few years a language emerges as more important than ours and an emerging culture becomes a top attraction and agent at the global level.This is a simple animated film for children who are going to love the monkeys and the birds, but they are also going to be nicely demonstrated that you do not need to be white or black, that all shades of grey are great, and that birds are so much better off and nicer in their natural environment. So do not hesitate and take your children - and grandchildren - to see it and buy the DVD. The music is great and will teach you how to shake your arms and legs and to move your bottom in rhythm, I mean you the adults and parents and grandparents because the children of today have it in their genes.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Exciting like a carnival and beautiful like a miracle,1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,2146,"['Brilliant', 'color', 'movement', 'action', 'drama', 'even', 'horror', 'lot', 'fun', 'parades', 'joy', 'ecstasy', 'running', 'away', 'running', 'even', 'lot', 'flying', 'up', 'down', 'especially', 'poor', 'Blue', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'fly', 'shame', 'parrot.A', 'little', 'depth', 'exotic', 'birds', 'are', 'endangered', 'smugglers', 'who', 'capture', 'away', 'sell', 'big', 'cities', 'developed', 'countries', 'here', 'USA', 'even', 'Minnesota', 'real', 'police', 'work', 'smugglers', 'just', 'union', 'victims', 'bird', 'lovers', 'just', 'prevent', 'succeeding', 'other', 'words', 'make', 'fail.The', 'most', 'astonishing', 'side', 'film', 'luminous', 'vision', 'Rio', 'Janeiro', 'carnival', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'there', 'go', 'next', 'week', 'spend', 'time', 'beaches', 'try', 'go', 'top', 'big', 'sugarloaf', 'mountains', 'meet', 'Christ', 'standing', 'top', 'tallest', 'perfect', 'strategy', 'emergent', 'country', 'today', 'been', 'target', 'latest', 'not', 'last', 'crisis', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'even', 'stronger', 'before', 'Conquer', 'world', 'not', 'only', 'money', 'certainly', 'not', 'weapons', 'bombs', 'culture', 'how', 'Americans', 'did', 'World', 'War', 'II.That', 'lesson', 'developed', 'countries', 'too', 'take', 'granted', 'languages', 'cultures', 'are', 'dominant', 'are', 'not', 'few', 'years', 'language', 'more', 'important', 'ours', 'emerging', 'culture', 'top', 'attraction', 'agent', 'global', 'level.This', 'simple', 'animated', 'film', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'monkeys', 'birds', 'are', 'also', 'going', 'be', 'nicely', 'demonstrated', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'white', 'black', 'shades', 'grey', 'are', 'great', 'birds', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'nicer', 'natural', 'environment', 'So', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'take', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'see', 'buy', 'DVD', 'music', 'great', 'will', 'teach', 'how', 'shake', 'arms', 'legs', 'move', 'bottom', 'rhythm', 'mean', 'adults', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'children', 'today', 'have', 'genes.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Rio

It wasn't as good as the Shrek movies or even Blue Sky's other movies like Ice Age, Robots or Horton Hears a Who, but it was good enough.The animation was nice and colorful.  It did have some moments wear you'd laugh out loud.  It had a good voice cast and some good musical numbers.  The only thing wrong with this movie is that there are way too much characters they wanted to put the spotlight on.  I mean, you have the main birds, Blu and Jewell, but they get overpowered by George Lopez' character along with Will.i.am and Jaime Foxx.  Not to mention that there are 3 different plots going on all at once which makes it hard for character development.  The moments with the poachers who kidnap Blu and Jewell and the parts with the annoying parrot Nigel could have been cut down significantly with keeping the same idea because I thought they brought down the movie.  Anne Hathaway, who is one of my favorite actresses of all time doesn't really too much to do as Jewell, even when she finally sings, Will.i.am and Jaime Foxx have to come in and rip some cool techno beats.I love cartoons and I watch every animated movie that comes out, this one was a little disappointing, but it's still watchable.",3,"Entertaining, but not as good as other Blue Sky movies.",1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,1241,"['movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Shrek', 'movies', 'even', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'other', 'movies', 'Ice', 'Age', 'Robots', 'Horton', 'Who', 'was', 'good', 'enough.The', 'animation', 'was', 'nice', 'colorful', 'did', 'have', 'moments', 'wear', ""'d"", 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'had', 'good', 'voice', 'cast', 'good', 'musical', 'numbers', 'only', 'thing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'characters', 'wanted', 'put', 'spotlight', 'mean', 'have', 'main', 'birds', 'Blu', 'Jewell', 'get', 'overpowered', 'George', 'Lopez', 'character', 'Will.i.am', 'Jaime', 'Foxx', 'Not', 'mention', 'are', '3', 'different', 'plots', 'going', 'once', 'hard', 'character', 'development', 'moments', 'poachers', 'who', 'kidnap', 'Blu', 'Jewell', 'parts', 'annoying', 'parrot', 'Nigel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'down', 'significantly', 'keeping', 'same', 'idea', 'thought', 'brought', 'down', 'movie', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'time', ""n't"", 'really', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'as', 'Jewell', 'even', 'when', 'finally', 'sings', 'Will.i.am', 'Jaime', 'Foxx', 'have', 'come', 'rip', 'cool', 'techno', 'beats.I', 'love', 'cartoons', 'watch', 'animated', 'movie', 'out', 'one', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'still', 'watchable']",Rio

Blu, the lead parrot, is taken to Rio to mate with the only remaining female of his species. Let's just say it wasn't love at first bite. But in the process, he is snatched by a group of bird smuggling thugs and handcuffed to his female companion. Unfortunately, Blu doesn't know how to fly and all of their escapes are hindered by his need to walk everywhere. Couple this with the lively atmosphere of the Carnival build-up and Blu's heartbroken owner trying desperately to find him. It's a story of cooperation, personal struggles, and hope for the endangered species especially in our rainforests.The music is fun, the characters are huge on the spectrum of being likable or hated.

I'd been waiting years for Pixar to get around to it, but alas, they are more focused on anthropomorphizing cars and trying to incinerate toys, so thankfully THIS studio took up the task.  And what an amazing result.I'm not sure, but I think that the main character of Blu is based on the Spix's Macaw - a very endangered parrot at this time.  Disturbing as the subject of bird-trafficking is, it was wise and important that the creators took on the subject to encourage more awareness, and I applaud them for doing so.A synopsis isn't needed here, as others have given that.  I simply want to add in my 2 cents towards highly recommending this movie.  Adults will enjoy it, as will kids.  As will my own birdies, who are going to get to watch it soon.  The animation is glorious, with eye-popping colors.  BluRay need not apply, as DVD format is just perfect in its rendering and clarity.  The detailing in such things as just the cross-thatching texture on the beaks of the macaws, and the way the feathers were rendered - some of those details added to the movie subtly for the benefit of ""bird people"" to notice and appreciate - was delightful.  There are a lot of those little treats tossed in, like the pigeon-toed way the parrots walked.  Loved it, loved it. The music is great, too.  Especially the opening titles theme and segment, done in an almost gentle and ethereal way as you're guided into the jungle setting populated with what are, to many, very ethereal creatures.  So well done.I did take away one star due to a minor annoyance.  I know some of the voice-over actors are African-American, but I don't think adding in SO many hip-hop cultural references, speech style and mannerisms fit in.  It was out of place and got old REALLY fast.  This was set in Brazil, with some characters originating from Minnesota, so more Brazilian and Minnesota jokes and puns should have been emphasized.  Even some of the music was in hip-hop style.  Give me a break already.  They did touch heavily on the Brazilian obsession with soccer in a hilarious way, so kudos for that, at least.All in all, this was a joy to watch.  I hope there will more movies in the future about birds.  Maybe one set in Australia, so we can see budgies and cockatiels in animated form.  Even most of our familiar backyard birds would prove to be funny and adorable characters in movies of this style.  It's a treasure-trove of possibilities.  So bottom line: get this and watch it.

EVERYBODY in the theater thinks that the character is pointing at them. It's an amazing experience and I don't think anybody in the theater was thinking about anything other than the muppet pointing at them. You are drawn in more when those things happen. Not taken out of the scene.Now, having said that, it has to be used sparingly. It's not cool to always have in-your-face shots. Your brain would tire of it. If you watch the behind the scenes of Tangled 3D BD (or maybe it was the Shrek 4 Dreamworks crew that said it), the directors talk about dialing up and down the depth of field in 3D so that your brain doesn't get used to seeing the in-your-face shots. They do this so that, when those shots do occur, your brain interprets those shots as something special.

Or maybe it's just that I want a guaranteed happy ending.Rio opens in a South American jungle with a baby blue macaw who falls from his nest and is immediately snatched by poachers, who take him to the US--Minnesota, to be precise. When his crate falls off a truck in the snow, the frightened, shivering little guy is found by a young girl, Linda, who takes him home with her.Fast forward fifteen years: Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann), now an adult, owns a bookstore. The macaw, Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg, whose sister, Hallie, coincidentally, shared the screen with another talking bird, Paulie), is her constant companion. All is well in their lives until the arrival of Tulio, an ornithologist from Brazil. He explains that Blu is the last male of his species, and he's needed in Brazil to mate with the last female to perpetuate the species. Linda initially refuses, in spite of Tulio's insistence that the future of the blue macaw is at stake. Finally, she changes her mind and they're en route to Rio.They arrive as the city is preparing for Carnivale. It's not love at first sight for Blu and the female macaw, Jewel (voice of Anne Hathaway, one of my favorite actresses). She's a beautiful but feisty creature bent on regaining her freedom. Left alone to get acquainted, she's focused on her jailbreak--until they're both snatched by a young boy, Fernando, working for a smuggler.Being forced to work together to escape isn't easy for the wild Jewel and domesticated Blu, who can't fly! I love the way she refers to him as ""pet,"" as if it's a dirty word. Jewel has quite a temper.Blu and Jewel manage to escape their captors--but chained together, they initially find themselves bickering most of the time. As you might expect, however, they soon begin to warm to each other. Assisted by several other birds and a bulldog (voice of George Lopez), they no sooner are freed from the chain that's held them together than Jewel is again captured.Meanwhile, as they search frantically for the missing birds, bookish Linda and hopelessly nerdy Tulio bond. Helped by the guilt-ridden orphan boy who stole them to start with, they end up chasing the smugglers into the big Carnivale parade. There, Linda and Blu see each other...but Blu chooses to go after the smugglers' truck, to rescue Jewel.Linda and Tulio race to the airstrip but are too late. The plane takes off in spite of their efforts to stop it. Blu manages to free all of the birds from their cages and open the cargo doors, but finds he's the only one who can't fly away. Jewel refuses to leave him and is injured in a fight with evil cockatoo Nigel, who works for the smugglers.Will Blu find the courage to fly and save himself and Jewel? Will he and Linda return to Minnesota...or will Linda find happiness with Tulio and Fernando and stay in Rio? Will Blu and Jewel save their species with a new generation of blue macaws?

And for no reason: Blu, the flightless bird in question, isn't even a turkey. So I attended the screening in Leicester Square, armed with discerning co-critics in the shape of my children, and figured that, worst case, at least I had a title for my review.The kids enjoyed it happily enough. I didn't. It wasn't a turkey, as such - Turkeys are fun to watch the same way Candid Camera is - but more of a damp, er, squab. (Sorry folks). For any parent who has owned a DVD player in the last decade, Rio will feel very, very, tiringly familiar.I like reviewing. I take it seriously, and I try to come up with a novel angle and provide new and thoughtful remarks for each picture I see. This is sometimes hard, but on occasions like this, it makes me positively resentful: why should I expend imaginative thought on reviewing a picture when the film makers themselves didn't bother when making the damn thing? Why don't I just create a review-by-numbers?Now it's no secret that Hollywood has a ""magic formula"" for its successful dramas, bequeathed to it fifty or more years ago by Joseph Campbell in a still-referenced book called ""The Hero With A Thousand Faces"". Indeed, it has been suggested that there are only seven basic plots in all of literature. Certainly, most popular commercial films (even serious ones) cleave more or less closely to one of these fictional archetypes.But of late this adherence to formula seems to have gone to a whole new place, especially in this new genre, the digitally animated children's movie. It's a genre I declare officially mature, established and subject to rapidly advancing decrepitude. Rio (and Mars Needs Moms) are my evidence for that claim.Nowadays it is not just plot but scene, casting, characterisation, colourisation and disposition that are done by rote: you fancy someone at Disney has drawn up something like a pilot's checklist for script vetting. Each new offering at most adds a new trope or contrivance to the library of available memes. As the library grows, the more memes there are to chose from, of course, and the less incentive there is to create new ones. The assembly of a film in this way becomes modular; a matter of supply-chaining.So it is with Rio. It is a classic journey of self discovery. Blu, a Brazilian macaw hatchling, is snatched from his nest and whisked away to captivity far from his native land (cf.Finding Nemo). He even has a Nemo-esque physical disability: he can't fly.Of course, he winds up back in Rio, and there contrives to meet a truculent paramour (cf.Stuart Little), be captured (again) by dastardly but inept animal traffickers (cf.Garfield), escape with the help of fellow captured animals (cf. Nemo again, also cf. Toy Story), be captured (again) this time by a dastardly big bird (cf. Stuart Little again), confront his fears, fall in love, while his owner falls in love too, and confronts her fears, and so on and so on.This is accompanied (or interrupted) by a set piece so strikingly resemblant of the jungle boogie inMadagascarthat the litigious type might sue over it. Even Avatar is scene-checked. All this in the context of a dull script, badly delivered jokes, and adventure/chase set pieces designed to show off the technical department's digital wizardry (fellas, we get the picture: you can do cool stuff with computers. How about doing some cool stuff with celluloid?) that have the wit and wisdom of your average seven year old.Admittedly, this is aimed at your average seven-year-old but, as Pixar has shown repeatedly, that's no reason a film can't be brilliantly funny for all ages.In a poor game there is still a man-of-the-match performance from Flight of The Conchords' Jemaine Clement as Nigel, a baddie cockatoo - one of the more convincing screen villains of recent times.I can't deny my children were entertained (by comparison they were positively aggravated by Mars Needs Moms).

1409345,AHF97M45JFCB,B004HO6I4M,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","Unlike industry moguls Pixar and DreamWorks, Blue Sky Studios hasn't been quite as versatile in their subject-matter when it comes to pumping out computer generated animated feature films.  Most people are aware of their ever-growing Ice Age franchise but do keep in mind that these are the guys behind Robots, Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who, the forthcoming Epic and Charles M Shultz's long overdue Peanuts CG film.  In short these guys have certainly been keeping busy!Amidst all of these projects, Blue Sky released Rio back in 2011; a vibrant piece that forever silenced naysayers who claimed the studio didn't have access to the incredible color pallets of the competition.  Costing an estimated $90-mil, Rio comes in at a runtime of 96-minutes and wears an appropriate G-rating.The story follows Blu, a wild born domesticated blue macaw thought to be the last of his breed, taken from Rio de Janeiro and then deposited in Minnesota only to head back to Brazil when an ornithologist believes that a potential mate has been secured in the wild.On an existential level there's some ironic tragedy in the concept of removing a wild animal from nature, domesticating it so that it is completely dependent upon human care, then returning it to the wild where it's unable to perform such basic survival tactics as fly but not to worry, Rio is a lot more about having fun then it is environmentalism agendas (thankfully).Add to this some well casted voice talent: Jesse Eisenberg as Blu; Anne Hathaway as his love interest Jewel; Jamie Foxx and will.i.am as a streetwise and musical canary and cardinal duo; George Lopez as a local toucan; Tracy Morgan as a slobbering bulldog; and Jemaine Clement of ""Flight of the Conchords"" fame stepping in as the villainous cockatoo Nigel.  The casting is flawless in their respective roles and add a great deal of energy to the visuals, which in case I haven't mentioned, are crisp, bright, and bouncy.The opening musical number, featuring a rainbow stream of various birds of paradise in choreographed flight sets the tone of things to come.  While the film flirts with the concept of being a dedicated musical, I am pleased to report that the music here does nothing but add to the party-like vibe of the affair.  Everything from some original salsa-flavored tunes to Lionel Richie's ""Say you, Say Me"" to one of Jemaine Clement's hilarious rap numbers (straight out of his book as the character Hip-hop-opotamus).Separating this from a strictly talking-animals affair however is the brilliantly intertwined B-story involving Blu's adopted mom Linda and said ornithologist (the nerdy but goodhearted Tulio) falling for one another as well.  Had I been charged with the job of naming this film, I believe something like ""Of Nerds and Birds"" would have been in order.In all I found Rio to be a magnificent entry into the competitive CG market from Blue Sky, perhaps their strongest, most fleshed out to date in fact.  I'm apparently not alone in this assessment either as a sequel (Rio 2) is on Blue Sky's release schedule for 2014 (smack dab between Epic and Peanuts).  An interesting side note- it's oft rumored that Rio was actually responsible for Pixar having cancelled a film they were putting together called ""newt"" due to plot similarities.

The film starts with promise with a prologue that introduces us to the main characters of Blu the macaw who cannot fly and Linda, a typical heroine from animation land who we all know will somehow end up in a bikini for Rio's carnival. The opening musical sequence of colorful birds set to Brazilian music is promising but the viewer will be disappointed to discover that, except for the end credits, that is the last you will see of such dancing antics and music. The remaining musical numbers are uninspiring and the use of two bird companions who rap and hip hop seems strangely out of place in a film supposedly set in Brazil.

Of course, the female has other plans, like an escape out of her caged confinement and the adventure begins...My issue was with the story, which was boring and slow at times, and lacked greatness. So I have to look to the writers. The story lacked a strong enough foundation, the drama, the hurdles the main character must go through in order to save the day. Those steps, create the tension, and it's that tension that hooks us to the main characters plight (take ""Gladiator""). This movie just didn't pack a punch, and it could have.A story doesn't have to be down played or made ""simple"" just because it is an animated movie.

And you, my fellow cinemaphobes, know that in the end, someway, somehow, Blu will be flying. After some excellent computer-animated features - ICE AGE, HORTON HEARS A WHO, etc - Blue Sky Studios hit a home run on this, their sixth feature. The visual technology here - especially in 3D - is every bit as good as the best from Pixar, DreamWorks and Disney Studios. Beyond the visuals, though, this is just a fun film for the entire family, with a humorous, heartwarming story...the actual rating is G, not PG; Blue Sky was able to get the original rating changed. There is also some top drawer voice acting in this film, by Jesse Eisenberg, as the nerdy, flightless, Blu; Ann Hathaway, as his love interest, Jewel; Leslie Mann as Linda, the owner of Blu; and Rodrigo Santoro as Tulio, who wants to get Blu and Jewel together because they are the last of their species. Also listen for Jamie Foxx as Nico, a canary who looks like Tweetie-Bird; and George Lopez, as Raphael, a Toucan who helps Blu and Jewel. There is plenty of adventure; plenty of romance between Blu and Jewel and Linda and Tulio; and plenty of song and dance numbers to a Brazilian beat...it ain't called RIO for nothing.

The actual premise is OK, but I was also immediately in touch with a film that was a bit pandering to the infant mentality. I immediately thought ""Kids ain't that dumb"". It's admirable that the mating habits of animals were suggested, and suddenly it became a romantic comedy, with perhaps every racial stereotype along the way to add to the proceedings, except any semblance of Brazilian.Quite simply, I wasn't very entertained. This is entirely due to a poorly structured script. The acting was fine, and there was a lot of clever animation and displays of the glories of the city, but I'm sure most kids will write it off as stuff they'd already seen.Routine, considering where animated features have gone, like SHREK or WALL-E or UP.I was just hoping for some originality.

It's guranteed to entertain the hell out of little kids, and definitely some adults. But, like most Blue Sky animated films, it just doesn't hold a candle to the likes of Pixar, or even DreamWorks (although it certainly tops their weaker films). I thought animation studios were done with the immature humor after seeing Up, Wall-E, and How To Train Your Dragon garner both critical acclaim, as well as Box Office success. Unfortunately, we still have to put up with characters like Will.i.am and Jamie Foxx's. Don't get me wrong. Those guys did a great job at delivering their lines. It's the lines themselves that I have a problem with.You can see in one of the trailers when Will.i.am's character (a red and black bird) does a little rap, and....I don't quite know why, but it sort of rubbed me the wrong way. I just thought to myself, ""You guys actually wrote that thinking it was good? And you got paid to?"" Maybe we just need better writers for kids' movies. Maybe producers need to take notes from Pixar, and stop approving them. Besides my gripes, this is still a decent movie. I was never bored while watching it, but I cannot ignore the cringe-worthy moments. If you can, more power to you. I recommend it for the sheer pageantry of it all, but with caution that it's more on the level of Ice Age (another Blue Sky film, that despite its praise, I did not like), and nowhere near Toy Story 3, How To Train Your Dragon, or even the moderately great, but most often just ""good"" Tangled and Despicable Me.",3,"Colorful and Musical,  but Not Much Else",1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,1670,"['Rio', 'great', 'music', 'superb', 'animation', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'fantastically', 'talented', 'cast', 'turning', 'excellent', 'voiceover', 'work', 'even', 'intriguing', 'story', 'guranteed', 'entertain', 'hell', 'little', 'kids', 'definitely', 'adults', 'most', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'animated', 'films', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'likes', 'Pixar', 'even', 'DreamWorks', 'certainly', 'weaker', 'films', 'thought', 'animation', 'studios', 'were', 'done', 'immature', 'humor', 'seeing', 'Up', 'Wall-E', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'garner', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'as', 'well', 'Box', 'Office', 'success', 'Unfortunately', 'still', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'characters', 'Will.i.am', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'guys', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'delivering', 'lines', 'lines', 'have', 'problem', 'with.You', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'trailers', 'when', 'Will.i.am', 'character', 'red', 'black', 'bird', 'little', 'rap', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'why', 'sort', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'just', 'thought', 'myself', 'guys', 'actually', 'wrote', 'thinking', 'was', 'good', 'got', 'paid', 'Maybe', 'just', 'need', 'better', 'writers', 'kids', 'movies', 'Maybe', 'producers', 'need', 'take', 'notes', 'Pixar', 'stop', 'approving', 'gripes', 'still', 'decent', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'watching', 'can', 'not', 'ignore', 'cringe-worthy', 'moments', 'can', 'more', 'power', 'recommend', 'sheer', 'pageantry', 'caution', 'more', 'level', 'Ice', 'Age', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'film', 'praise', 'did', 'not', 'nowhere', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'How', 'Train', 'Your', 'Dragon', 'even', 'moderately', 'great', 'most', 'often', 'just', 'good', 'Tangled', 'Despicable', 'Me']",Rio

This can only mean one thing: Rio needs a big backhomer* warning! And after the recent, wonderful for adults, Rango, and the wonderful for adults and kids, Despicable Me, and the wonderful for kids, Hop, Rio has its work cut out to be THE Easter blockbuster.Unfortunately, for everything Rio does well it gets a dozen things wrong; it doesn't even flow, let alone fly.5 stars for Jermaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as nasty Nigel and for his song, it's the undoubted highlight of Rio.4 stars for the rest of the music, there is something Jungle Book-esque about the way music permeates Rio, and 4 stars for the sumptuous, sunny visuals but that is almost to be expected from animations these days. In many cases the animation is the gloss over the cracks of the rest of the movie and just because there's lots of colour and movement, it doesn't necessarily mean that anything good is happening.3 stars for 3-D which again is proving not to be the future of entertainment but just another cash grab. The vibrancy and vividness of Rio make for some wonderful effects but the point is you don't MISS the 3-D when viewing in 2-D.2 stars for story, young kids will love it but most over 8s will have seen similar a dozen or so times already in their lives. Rio doesn't exactly copy and paste from other movies (Madagascar excepted) but the plot is as formulaic as it's possible to be.And 1 star, ultimately, for just being a very lazy and clich&eacute;d movie. There's little to actually recommend here, nothing is particularly defined. The bad guys aren't especially so, apart from Nigel. The stooges and support are direct from some kind of off-the-peg central casting for comedic support. The Rio backdrop is vivid and delightful but there is no sense of this actually being Brazil. The story is a mish-mash with no real threat or terror involved. And the movie as a whole is all rather thrown together: lots of scenes and lots of imagination, vital ingredients, but the resultant concotion is more collapsed souffl&eacute; than magnificent meringue.Finally, i really should dock a star for the way Nigel met his end. Completely out of character with the rest of the film and not a fitting end for such a memorable villain.So, fantastic and vibrant visuals, formualic and flat story. 3 stars: Well average!*Backhomer - i.e You get back home and wish you'd stayed there in the first place.

1409402,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B004HO6I4M,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 3]","Rio (Animation, Adventure, Comedy)Directed by Carlos SaldanhaStarring the voices of Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway and George Lopez20th Century Fox | 2011 | 96 min | Rated G | Released Aug 02, 2011Video:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 2.40:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1English: Descriptive Audio Dolby Digital 5.1Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1French: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles:English SDH, SpanishDiscs:50GB Blu-ray DiscDVD copyDigital copyThe Film 3.5/5After seeing a trailer for Rio, I wasn't expecting much when I finally sat down to watch the movie. The trailer consisted of animals shrieking or screaming and performing stupid moves such as dancing. I also dislike that every scene has to be punctuated with a blast from the subwoofer. I chose to watch your trailer and you're going to hold my attention for two minutes, so you don't have to blast noise at me to keep me watching. I'll decide whether something is interesting or dramatic by myself, thanks. That's becoming a huge annoyance.Anyway, let's get back to the movie.I love the way Rio opens. There are birds everywhere and they are happily dancing. The colors are very striking and I don't think I have ever seen a more colorful movie. Birds and other animals seem to cover most of the colors in the spectrum and the look of the movie is appealing throughout.Blu (Eisenberg) is a tiny young macaw and he's captured during the opening scene. We see him rescued by a girl named Linda (Leslie Mann), and he's completely happy as her pet for the next 15 years. The two share a bond and it's a heartwarming relationship. Their world is turned upside down when an ornithologist begs her to take Blu to Brazil as he's thought to be the last male of his species. Linda is reluctant, but eventually agrees.The two fly to Rio and Blu is introduced to Jewel (Hathaway), his prospective mate. Jewel is more concerned about escape and can't understand why Blu tolerates humans. The two are left overnight to begin their courtship, but a boy steals them and sells them to a gang which deals in rare birds.The remainder of the story shows what happens as Linda tries to find Blu. She initially rescued him before he learned how to fly and it becomes clear that he still hasn't discovered how it's done. Blu is aided by a variety of other birds as he attempts to find Linda. The gang enlists minions to find Blu and Jewel, resulting in a number of fights and chase scenes.Rio lacks the heart of Pixar movies, but it does have some redeeming qualities. The story is far from original and it's not difficult to guess the entire plot after a few minutes. Despite that, some of the scenes are quite charming. It's fast-paced and doesn't contain any dull moments. I imagine younger children being captivated by Blu's adventures and the color scheme and ever-present Brazilian music is more than enough to hold their attention.I enjoyed the story. Yes, I knew what was going to happen, but I found the characters quite likable. The animation becomes more detailed as the story progresses and some of the scenes contain incredible detail. The music is catchy and will be burned into your brain if you're not careful. This movie won't change your life, but it's an enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes.Video Quality 5/5The most obvious thing about the picture quality is the excellent use of color. The transfer boasts a variety of appealing colors and will capture your attention. The backgrounds seem a little unfinished in the opening scenes, but that's a stylistic choice and not a fault of the presentation. Later scenes, such as those in the Carnaval, are full of detail. You can clearly make out feathers and hairs on the various animals, and some of the scenery looks spectacular. This is a feast for the eyes and shouldn't disappoint anyone.Audio Quality 5/5The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix matches the excellent video quality. The opening scene hints at what is to come and features a pounding Brazilian beat with a multitude of birds singing and squawking. Dialogue is clear throughout the movie and background sounds are frequently worked into the mix.Special Features 4/5The extras are all presented in full HD:The Fruit Stand (1:29) - A deleted scene in which the animation is unfinished.Explore the World of Rio - An interactive map with four locations to explore.Saving the Species: One Voice at a Time (24:49) - The best of the features includes comments from the cast and crew.The Making of Hot Wings (8:02) - Talking about some of the music used in the movie.Boom-Boom Tish-Tish: The Sounds of Rio (13:30) - A more in-depth look at the music.Carnival Dance-o-Rama - Learn various dance moves.Welcome to Rio Music Video (1:37)Taio Cruz - Telling the World Music Video (1:54)Rio de Jam-eiro Jukebox (8:34) - Includes five songs from the movie.Postcards from Rio - Create your own postcards.The Real Rio (9:31) - Cast and crew comment on the real place.Theatrical Trailer (2:26)Digital Copy ""How To"" (3:35)Angry Birds:Trailer (1:32), Nigel Mashup (2:17) and Exclusive Clue Video (0:28)BD-LiveRio is fun to experience at least once.

Talking animals: check.  A romantic interest: check.  An exotic location: check.  Bright, lavish colors and some songs: check.  A cast of quirky supporting characters: check.  So how did Rio manage to fly a bit lower than it looked like it should have done on paper?  I'd go back to the characters.  Blu is likable and a bit neurotic out of his element and works alright as the lead character but the rest of the cast falls a little flat.  Blu's partner/ owner, Linda, is gentle and caring and not much else.  Blu's love interest, Jewel, doesn't have much going on other than she's mean and yearns to be free.  The bird doctor is daffy but, along with the other human representations of Rio de Janeiro's citizenry, could come off as a little offensive (don't believe me? go back and look at all of the main human characters who are Brazilian: you have the cooky bird guy and his inept, too-tight spandex wearing security officer; you have the thieving thugs, both mean and dim-witted; you have the orphan boy who, though sympathetic, is a thief).  I'm sure that kids won't take it this way and they will find some humor in these characters and that they're all cartoonish, i.e., exagerrated but still...I'm just saying.  As for the other animals: did anyone else find the tweety bird and woodpecker annoying? George Lopez's (a gifted comedian) character is played straight and isn't very interesting other than to look at; the drooling bulldog...was hard to watch as that slobber was just too real.  Perhaps the only other character that was better developed than most was Nigel, the evil cockatoo (how can cockatoo be evil? they are some sweet birds!).

It has great voice acting. There are also some decent action sequences (though not many in number). What it doesn't have is a compelling narrative that would make us relate to the central characters, two blue macaws Blue and Jewel.Timid and bookish Blu (voice by Jesse Eisenberg) and feisty Jewel (Anne Hathaway) are the last of their kind. And having been raised in Minnesota by a bookstore owner Linda, Blue cannot fly. The film's weak opening gets better when Blu and Jewel are stolen from an ornithological institute in Rio by smugglers.Most of the story based on a comedic fish-out-of-water situation takes place in Rio de Janeiro. This is a wise decision as the city provides the animated film (directed by Carlos Saldanha, co-director of ""Ice Age"" with Chris Wedge; director of its two sequels) with opportunities to show the beautifully rendered visuals full of bright colors.But the film needs better storytelling. The script (with four credited screen writers) is not really great, just acceptable. The most disappointing thing about ""Rio"" is that neither the story nor the characters is given a chance to be really involving. It seems the filmmakers are not willing to take any chance, as seen in the half-hearted character development of human characters, especially Linda. Someone like Brad Bird would have given her a chance to shine.

The story is about the illegal exotic bird trade with perhaps the last two birds of their kind captured by the traders. The male was brought to Brazil by his owner who was convinced by a conservationist that he was needed to mate with the conservation group's female. The conservation center is broken into and the pair of rare birds are stolen. Most of the rest of the movie are the attempts of the two birds, who end up chained together and manage to escape from the smugglers, to break the chain and get get back to the jungle (for the female) or the owner (for the male). Did I mention that the birds can talk with one another and with other animals? The male is way out of his element--he can't even fly--which leads to a lot of hilarious situations. Spoiler--you may want to skip this piece of commentary, although you can see it coming in the plot: Meanwhile, the owner and conservationist and the ""inside man"" (who has regretted what he did), are trying to track down the two birds.

1409444,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004HO6I4M,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[77, 94]","The best single word I can use to describe the film Rio is 'vibrant' as it's the colors that really hit you.  One can see why, when you're doing a story about birds, setting it in Brazil with its dazzling variety of brilliantly multicolored avian species is a truly inspired choice.The story begins when a baby blue macaw in the Brazilian rain forest falls (literally) into the hands of exotic animal poachers and ends up being shipped to the US where, by a fortunate accident, he ends up being adopted by a young girl named Linda in a small town in, of all places, wintry Minnesota.  A quick flash forward shows girl and bird, which she names Blu, growing up together, to fifteen years later where Linda is now an adult who owns her own bookstore. The thing is though, Blu, raised as a house-bird, never learned how to fly.The plot really begins when a Brazilian ornithologist named Tulio comes to Linda's store, having learned from her web-site that she's the owner of Blu, who apparently is one of the last male blue macaws in the world. Despite getting off on the wrong foot with Linda, he eventually persuades her to come with him to Brazil so that they can mate Blu with a female blue macaw named Jewel that they've managed to capture. Once there, however, the mating plan hits a snag as Jewel wants only to escape back to her jungle and has nothing but disdain for Blu, who only wants to get back with his human.  Further complications set in when both birds are stolen by exotic animal black-marketeers who intend to sell them to the highest bidder. The two birds, though chained together, manage to escape, but it's rough going, particularly when Jewel discovers that Blu can't fly and she can't fly away while she's chained to him, and the bird thieves are hot on their trail, right in the middle of Brazil's biggest and most flamboyant of all festivals, Carnival.Director/writer Carlos Saldanha goes the distance in bringing some authentic Brazilian touches to the film. I particularly liked the way in which he brought out how everyone in Brazil is soccer-crazy, with good guys and bad constantly being distracted whenever a game is on.The themes are familiar ones - characters are thrust out of their familiar environments into ones they find strange and challenging, characters who don't get along but are stuck together learn to appreciate each other, danger threatens, help comes from unexpected quarters, fears are overcome, and so on - but the characters in Rio are engaging and the story-telling is well done so you just lean back and enjoy the show. And Rio is a true visual pleasure to watch just for the sheer vibrancy of its colors and for the exotic setting of Rio de Janeiro during Carnival.The voice actors for the most part do a creditable job bringing their characters to life. The stand-outs are clearly Jesse Eisenberg (The Social Network) as Blu and Anne Hathaway (The Devil Wears Prada) as Jewel, who succeed in not only bringing out the individual personalities of the two macaws but also make you believe in the way the two birds gradually begin to accept and relate to each other. But Leslie Mann and Rodrigo Santoro are also exceptional as the humans Linda and Tulio, Mann for bringing out Linda's mix of independence and introvert and Santoro for Tulio's engagingly manic if clumsy extrovert.  Comedic actor Tracy Morgan has fun voicing Luiz, a Carnival-loving bulldog whose bark may be worse than his bite but whose drool trumps both. And Jermaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) adds a deliciously nasty touch as the villainous cockatoo, Nigel.(Note: I was wondering why a Brazilian cockatoo was talking with what sounded like an Australian accent, but I later found out that cockatoos are in fact of Australasian origin. So chalk up another point for Rio for being educational as well as entertaining.)The songs are enjoyable if largely forgettable but nicely add to the Brazilian atmosphere. The stand-out exception is the song Nigel sings (as near as I can tell, it's simply called ""Nigel's Song"") where he explains why he is ""not a pretty bird"".  There seems to be some kind of rule, in recent years anyway, that in any animated musical film, the bad guys always get the best songs.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys beautifully colored  animation, engaging characters and good basic storytelling.",4,"Familiar themes, but highly entertaining with gorgeous animation",1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,4348,"['best', 'single', 'word', 'can', 'use', 'describe', 'film', 'Rio', ""'vibrant"", 'colors', 'really', 'hit', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'when', ""'re"", 'doing', 'story', 'birds', 'setting', 'Brazil', 'dazzling', 'variety', 'brilliantly', 'multicolored', 'avian', 'species', 'truly', 'inspired', 'choice.The', 'story', 'when', 'baby', 'blue', 'macaw', 'Brazilian', 'rain', 'forest', 'falls', 'literally', 'hands', 'exotic', 'animal', 'poachers', 'up', 'being', 'shipped', 'US', 'where', 'fortunate', 'accident', 'up', 'being', 'adopted', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Linda', 'small', 'town', 'places', 'wintry', 'Minnesota', 'A', 'quick', 'flash', 'forward', 'girl', 'bird', 'Blu', 'growing', 'up', 'together', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'where', 'Linda', 'now', 'adult', 'who', 'own', 'bookstore', 'thing', 'Blu', 'raised', 'house-bird', 'never', 'learned', 'how', 'fly.The', 'plot', 'really', 'when', 'Brazilian', 'ornithologist', 'named', 'Tulio', 'Linda', 'store', 'having', 'learned', 'web-site', 'owner', 'Blu', 'who', 'apparently', 'one', 'last', 'male', 'blue', 'macaws', 'world', 'getting', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'Linda', 'eventually', 'come', 'Brazil', 'can', 'mate', 'Blu', 'female', 'blue', 'macaw', 'named', 'Jewel', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'capture', 'Once', 'there', 'however', 'mating', 'plan', 'snag', 'Jewel', 'only', 'escape', 'back', 'jungle', 'nothing', 'disdain', 'Blu', 'who', 'only', 'get', 'back', 'human', 'Further', 'complications', 'set', 'when', 'birds', 'are', 'stolen', 'exotic', 'animal', 'black-marketeers', 'who', 'intend', 'sell', 'highest', 'bidder', 'two', 'birds', 'though', 'chained', 'together', 'manage', 'escape', 'rough', 'going', 'particularly', 'when', 'Jewel', 'Blu', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fly', 'away', 'chained', 'bird', 'thieves', 'are', 'hot', 'trail', 'right', 'middle', 'Brazil', 'biggest', 'most', 'flamboyant', 'festivals', 'Carnival.Director/writer', 'Carlos', 'Saldanha', 'distance', 'bringing', 'authentic', 'Brazilian', 'touches', 'film', 'particularly', 'liked', 'way', 'brought', 'out', 'how', 'everyone', 'Brazil', 'soccer-crazy', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'constantly', 'being', 'distracted', 'whenever', 'game', 'on.The', 'themes', 'are', 'familiar', 'ones', 'characters', 'are', 'thrust', 'familiar', 'environments', 'ones', 'find', 'strange', 'challenging', 'characters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'are', 'stuck', 'together', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'other', 'danger', 'threatens', 'help', 'unexpected', 'quarters', 'fears', 'are', 'overcome', 'so', 'characters', 'Rio', 'are', 'engaging', 'story-telling', 'well', 'done', 'so', 'just', 'lean', 'back', 'enjoy', 'show', 'Rio', 'true', 'visual', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'just', 'sheer', 'vibrancy', 'colors', 'exotic', 'setting', 'Rio', 'Janeiro', 'Carnival.The', 'voice', 'actors', 'most', 'part', 'do', 'creditable', 'job', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'stand-outs', 'are', 'clearly', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'Social', 'Network', 'Blu', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Jewel', 'who', 'succeed', 'not', 'only', 'bringing', 'out', 'individual', 'personalities', 'two', 'macaws', 'also', 'make', 'believe', 'way', 'two', 'birds', 'gradually', 'begin', 'accept', 'relate', 'other', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'Rodrigo', 'Santoro', 'are', 'also', 'exceptional', 'humans', 'Linda', 'Tulio', 'Mann', 'bringing', 'out', 'Linda', 'mix', 'independence', 'introvert', 'Santoro', 'Tulio', 'engagingly', 'manic', 'clumsy', 'extrovert', 'Comedic', 'actor', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'fun', 'voicing', 'Luiz', 'Carnival-loving', 'bulldog', 'bark', 'may', 'be', 'worse', 'bite', 'drool', 'Jermaine', 'Clement', 'Flight', 'Conchords', 'deliciously', 'nasty', 'touch', 'villainous', 'cockatoo', 'Nigel', 'Note', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'Brazilian', 'cockatoo', 'was', 'talking', 'what', 'sounded', 'Australian', 'accent', 'later', 'found', 'out', 'cockatoos', 'are', 'fact', 'Australasian', 'origin', 'So', 'chalk', 'up', 'point', 'Rio', 'being', 'educational', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'songs', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'largely', 'forgettable', 'nicely', 'add', 'Brazilian', 'atmosphere', 'stand-out', 'exception', 'song', 'Nigel', 'sings', 'as', 'can', 'tell', 'simply', 'called', 'Nigel', 'Song', 'where', 'why', 'not', 'pretty', 'bird', 'be', 'kind', 'rule', 'recent', 'years', 'anyway', 'animated', 'musical', 'film', 'bad', 'guys', 'always', 'get', 'best', 'songs.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'beautifully', 'colored', 'animation', 'engaging', 'characters', 'good', 'basic', 'storytelling']",Rio

1409448,A20L63B48RPSOH,B004HO6I4M,Wix,"[0, 0]","Rio is the story of a Brazillian macaw who is bird-napped as a chick and finds himself in the adoring care of a bookstore owner in the Midwest. After a bird scientist from Brazil discovers that Linda has the last male macaw of his species, Linda decides to take Blu to Brazil to meet the lovely Jewel, a female Hyacinth macaw who is also the last of her species. (some say these birds are supposed to represent the Spix species, yet they are illustrated as and referred to as the endangered ""blue"" (hyacinth) macaw - just an FYI)Of course there is a hitch and both birds are stolen by those pesky smugglers who captured Blu years ago. The plot thickens with the help of a whacky cockatoo who helps trap other birds for smugglers, and these really funny monkeys who also aim to keep Blu and Jewel in cages.The happy ending I won't spoil, but I will say this movie is 5 stars. Sweet, peppy and entertaining along with a gentle message about the horrid practice of bird smuggling. In reality, Blu's species is threatened and adults could do well to further research the issues brought up by this film. Now I will describe why it is 4 for this review.Let's start with the Blu Ray disc. Turns out there is an issue with the disc and PS3. Sometimes clearing your BD data file can help, but many people have issues with the movie randomly freezing up for a second or two. It gets annoying.Secondly, if you have an Android and want to use the Pocket Blu digital copy - good luck. I have an unrooted Acer Iconia A500 and the app will not transfer the copy. It tells me I am rooted half the time, then when it does accept the code it freezes. Not impressed. Putting it on Windows also led to a freeze, plus they forced me to upgrade my WMP and my DRM.

When we saw the trailers for Rango, my husband and I realized that it was not for a six-year-old, and then Hop came along. It seemed like a kid-friendly movie, but none of us enjoyed it, not even my bunny-loving child. So, when I saw the trailer for Rio, I was predictably wary. The long Easter weekend convinced us to give it a try (for want of something better to do). I am so glad we watched this delightful movie - the vibrant colors, the exotic setting, and quirky set of characters make this an enjoyable family-friendly movie.Rio is the story of Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg), a cerulean male macaw, who finds himself taken away from his native habitat and about to be sold at a pet store somewhere in Minnesota. Luckily for him, a young girl named Linda (the adult Linda is voiced by Leslie Mann) finds him and cares for him. The pair form a very close bond until an ornithologist, Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) comes along and convinces Linda that Blu, being the last male of his species, needs to mate with his female counterpart to keep his kind alive.Linda and Blu go off to Rio in Brazil where Carnival is in full swing, and amidst all of the celebrations, Blu finds himself falling for the lovely Jewel (Anne Hathaway), his female counterpart. Jewel is fiercely independent and resents being confined in a cage, and is determined to find freedom. Over the course of the movie, the pair find themselves being kidnapped by criminals specializing in the capture and sale of exotic birds, and facing down an evil nemesis in the form of an ugly white cockatoo named Nigel (Jemaine Clement). The rest of the story focuses on their escape attempts while Linda and Tulio try to find them.The movie is kid-friendly with one exception - the baddie in this show, i.e. Nigel is actually quite creepy and frightened my daughter who is usually not very sensitive about such things. Nigel's appearance is quite evil-looking and scary, and coupled with his effectively creepy voice, the effects are quite frightening for young children, so parents may want to take note of this.Otherwise, the movie is pure fun - the songs are OK, not incredibly catchy or memorable, but the colors and setting more than make up for these flaws. The chemistry between the two macaws, Blu and Jewel drive the movie and make it an interesting watch for both adults and kids. Final verdict - highly watchable and fun family entertainment!",4,Birds of all feathers entertain in this fun movie!,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,2495,"['Having', 'six-year-old', 'means', 'having', 'be', 'really', 'careful', 'when', 'making', 'movie', 'choices', 'When', 'saw', 'trailers', 'Rango', 'husband', 'realized', 'was', 'not', 'six-year-old', 'then', 'Hop', 'came', 'along', 'seemed', 'kid-friendly', 'movie', 'none', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'even', 'bunny-loving', 'child', 'So', 'when', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Rio', 'was', 'predictably', 'wary', 'long', 'Easter', 'weekend', 'convinced', 'give', 'try', 'want', 'something', 'better', 'do', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'watched', 'delightful', 'movie', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'exotic', 'setting', 'quirky', 'set', 'characters', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'family-friendly', 'movie.Rio', 'story', 'Blu', 'voiced', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'cerulean', 'male', 'macaw', 'who', 'taken', 'away', 'native', 'habitat', 'be', 'sold', 'pet', 'store', 'somewhere', 'Minnesota', 'Luckily', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Linda', 'adult', 'Linda', 'voiced', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'cares', 'pair', 'form', 'very', 'close', 'bond', 'ornithologist', 'Tulio', 'Rodrigo', 'Santoro', 'along', 'convinces', 'Linda', 'Blu', 'being', 'last', 'male', 'species', 'needs', 'mate', 'female', 'counterpart', 'keep', 'kind', 'alive.Linda', 'Blu', 'go', 'Rio', 'Brazil', 'where', 'Carnival', 'full', 'swing', 'celebrations', 'Blu', 'falling', 'lovely', 'Jewel', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'female', 'counterpart', 'Jewel', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'resents', 'being', 'confined', 'cage', 'determined', 'find', 'freedom', 'course', 'movie', 'pair', 'find', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'criminals', 'specializing', 'capture', 'sale', 'exotic', 'birds', 'facing', 'down', 'evil', 'nemesis', 'form', 'ugly', 'white', 'cockatoo', 'named', 'Nigel', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'rest', 'story', 'escape', 'attempts', 'Linda', 'Tulio', 'try', 'find', 'them.The', 'movie', 'kid-friendly', 'one', 'exception', 'baddie', 'show', 'i.e', 'Nigel', 'actually', 'quite', 'creepy', 'frightened', 'daughter', 'who', 'usually', 'not', 'very', 'sensitive', 'such', 'things', 'Nigel', 'appearance', 'quite', 'evil-looking', 'scary', 'coupled', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'voice', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'frightening', 'young', 'children', 'parents', 'may', 'want', 'take', 'note', 'this.Otherwise', 'movie', 'pure', 'fun', 'songs', 'are', 'OK', 'not', 'incredibly', 'catchy', 'memorable', 'colors', 'setting', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'flaws', 'chemistry', 'two', 'macaws', 'Blu', 'Jewel', 'drive', 'movie', 'make', 'interesting', 'watch', 'adults', 'kids', 'Final', 'verdict', 'highly', 'watchable', 'fun', 'family', 'entertainment']",Rio
