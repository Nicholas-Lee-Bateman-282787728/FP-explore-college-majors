How can a 1980 performance look like a million dollar... We all know the limitations of older recordings and that's what you have to keep in mind before buying vintage concerts. Personally I am attracted by the emotion you can feel watching such amazing and unbelievable musicianship. There are only too few of these remarkable DVDs available today. Please keep'em coming, I am all for it, because high end technology can't make up for the awful music being released today. Keep the 5.1-Blue Ray-schmaltz and give us the real deal. (of course if you got the real deal in high quality I won't mind either!
