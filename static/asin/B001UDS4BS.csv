Harrison Ford plays an ICE Agent whose job is to seek out illegal immigrants.3. His major problem is that he has a heart, and sometimes gets deeper into busts than he should.4.

It seems that there are no happy endings for illegal immigrants, and those who aid and abet them.A tired looking Harry Ford leads the pack of gifted actors in this surprisingly gripping movie, which will leave you with every emotion except bored.Supporting roles are played by Ashley Judd, Ray Liotta, Cliff Curtis, Jim Sturgess and Alice Eve, and there are several scenes which will leave a bad taste in your mouth and some that will break your heart.This is a movie you may have overlooked, but shouldn't miss as a rental.Amanda Richards, June 27, 2009",4,All types of illegal,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,886,"['Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'SASS', ':1', 'Everybody', 'want', 'live', 'USA2', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'ICE', 'Agent', 'job', 'seek', 'out', 'illegal', 'immigrants.3', 'major', 'problem', 'heart', 'sometimes', 'deeper', 'busts', 'should.4', 'Seemingly', 'different', 'storylines', 'somehow', 'get', 'tied', 'together', 'end.5', 'are', 'happy', 'endings', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'who', 'aid', 'abet', 'them.A', 'tired', 'looking', 'Harry', 'Ford', 'pack', 'gifted', 'actors', 'surprisingly', 'gripping', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'emotion', 'bored.Supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'played', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'will', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'will', 'break', 'heart.This', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'overlooked', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss', 'rental.Amanda', 'Richards', 'June', '27', '2009']",Crossing Over

This film discusses multiple viewpoints on the issues of immigration to the U.S.  Some viewers have put it down because of the role of Harrison Ford...expecting perhaps an action flick and being disappointed.  Others have denigrated the film for its adult themes.  Perhaps others might be opposed to this film on the basis of its content, believing that 'America is for Americans' and that this film shouldn't have been made.  I know a number of Native Americans that would disagree with this last one.Ultimately, this movie should be considered to be about illumination, shining the light into the dark corners of our immigration system.  We all know it is dysfunctional, and what is represented in this film are just a few generalized stories of events that occur on a daily basis.  No one person or group is to blame, we are all a part of the process.  Ignorance of the issues is not an excuse, and the problems of the world, including that of immigration, do not spontaneously resolve but should be met head on by all concerned parties.  Immigration is a social, political and human rights issue and regardless of heated emotions should be discussed with an open mind.  After a fashion, we are all immigrants, we all just arrived here at different times.  This is a film that should be watched and discussed.  Through discussion and understanding come illumination, and eventually, action to change the system to one that is more relevant to the modern world.  We all have a mind, a voice, and hopefully a conscience.  This movie reminds us to use our innate humanity and compassion for positive change.",5,"Emotionally, philosophically, politically and spiritually difficult movie",1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,1650,"['must', 'admit', 'struggled', 'movie', 'film', 'multiple', 'viewpoints', 'issues', 'immigration', 'U.S', 'viewers', 'have', 'put', 'down', 'role', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'expecting', 'perhaps', 'action', 'flick', 'being', 'disappointed', 'Others', 'have', 'denigrated', 'film', 'adult', 'themes', 'Perhaps', 'others', 'might', 'be', 'opposed', 'film', 'basis', 'content', 'believing', ""'America"", 'Americans', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', 'know', 'number', 'Native', 'Americans', 'would', 'disagree', 'last', 'one.Ultimately', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'illumination', 'shining', 'light', 'dark', 'corners', 'immigration', 'system', 'know', 'dysfunctional', 'what', 'represented', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'generalized', 'stories', 'events', 'occur', 'daily', 'basis', 'one', 'person', 'group', 'blame', 'are', 'part', 'process', 'Ignorance', 'issues', 'not', 'excuse', 'problems', 'world', 'including', 'immigration', 'do', 'not', 'spontaneously', 'resolve', 'should', 'be', 'met', 'head', 'concerned', 'parties', 'Immigration', 'social', 'political', 'human', 'rights', 'issue', 'regardless', 'heated', 'emotions', 'should', 'be', 'discussed', 'open', 'mind', 'fashion', 'are', 'immigrants', 'just', 'arrived', 'here', 'different', 'times', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'discussed', 'discussion', 'understanding', 'come', 'illumination', 'eventually', 'action', 'change', 'system', 'one', 'more', 'relevant', 'modern', 'world', 'have', 'mind', 'voice', 'hopefully', 'conscience', 'movie', 'use', 'innate', 'humanity', 'compassion', 'positive', 'change']",Crossing Over
1238668,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001UDS4BS,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Crossing Over is a good attempt at giving viewers a storyline concerning the ever so popular as of late subject of green card issues and illegal immigrants in America.The storyline focuses around different ethnic groups living in America, and the constant struggles and dramatic situations they have to persevere on a daily basis.  The flow of the movie is divided so there's a decent amount of attention given to each of the plots that focuses around a Jewish man who doesn't know much about his culture, a Middle Eastern school girl who creates controversy at her high school, an Asian man who gets involved in dangerous gangs against his will, and an Australian woman who sleeps around.None of these people ever come into contact with each other- the writers of the film made it so it's four stories constantly jumping back and forth.  It actually works though because it means when one story overstays its welcome, the other story comes along and entertains the viewers for a few minutes.  This is what the pacing is like the entire time.There's a lot of nudity concerning the Australian woman- please keep this in mind.  Without spoiling anything, each ethnic group goes through a series of ups and downs emotionally just for the opportunity of getting to live in the United States.I'd say for the most part the storyline maintains a somewhat interesting flow, but the thing is, it's entirely up to *you* concerning how interesting such a subject really is.If you've lived in America your entire life, you won't find such a subject particularly interesting, which is a situation I found myself in while watching Crossing Over.  I've never had to encounter green card issues, so such a thing was not really *new* to me necessarily (I'm aware of the issue since I watch the news quite often) but never something I ever gave serious attention to.There's never really much attention given to the actual borderline between Mexico and America, even though you get the feeling there should have been.There's a really violent and surprising shooting scene involving a mini mart that the Asian guy is a part of.  Don't miss this part.My biggest complaint is that Harrison Ford is getting quite old- too old for such a movie.  I'm kidding, haha.  Though he *is* aging dramatically, he did a fine job in his performance.  His role decreases as the movie goes along though.Good enough for a viewing.",4,good enough,1304985600,"05 10, 2011",2011,2392,"['Crossing', 'Over', 'good', 'attempt', 'giving', 'viewers', 'storyline', 'concerning', 'ever', 'so', 'popular', 'late', 'subject', 'green', 'card', 'issues', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'America.The', 'storyline', 'around', 'different', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'living', 'America', 'constant', 'struggles', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'have', 'persevere', 'daily', 'basis', 'flow', 'movie', 'divided', 'so', 'decent', 'amount', 'attention', 'given', 'plots', 'Jewish', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'culture', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'school', 'girl', 'who', 'controversy', 'high', 'school', 'Asian', 'man', 'who', 'involved', 'dangerous', 'gangs', 'will', 'Australian', 'woman', 'who', 'around.None', 'people', 'ever', 'come', 'contact', 'other-', 'writers', 'film', 'made', 'four', 'stories', 'constantly', 'jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'actually', 'when', 'one', 'story', 'welcome', 'other', 'story', 'along', 'viewers', 'few', 'minutes', 'what', 'pacing', 'entire', 'time.There', 'lot', 'nudity', 'concerning', 'Australian', 'woman-', 'please', 'keep', 'mind', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'ethnic', 'group', 'series', 'ups', 'downs', 'emotionally', 'just', 'opportunity', 'getting', 'live', 'United', 'States.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'most', 'part', 'storyline', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'flow', 'thing', 'entirely', '*you*', 'concerning', 'how', 'interesting', 'such', 'subject', 'really', 'is.If', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'America', 'entire', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'such', 'subject', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'situation', 'found', 'watching', 'Crossing', 'Over', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'encounter', 'green', 'card', 'issues', 'so', 'such', 'thing', 'was', 'not', 'really', '*new*', 'necessarily', ""'m"", 'aware', 'issue', 'watch', 'news', 'quite', 'often', 'never', 'something', 'ever', 'gave', 'serious', 'attention', 'never', 'really', 'much', 'attention', 'given', 'actual', 'borderline', 'Mexico', 'America', 'even', 'get', 'feeling', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'really', 'violent', 'surprising', 'shooting', 'scene', 'involving', 'mini', 'mart', 'Asian', 'guy', 'part', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'part.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'getting', 'quite', 'old-', 'too', 'old', 'such', 'movie', ""'m"", 'kidding', 'haha', 'aging', 'dramatically', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'performance', 'role', 'movie', 'along', 'though.Good', 'enough', 'viewing']",Crossing Over
1238669,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B001UDS4BS,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[1, 1]","Let me say, from the beginning, that I admire Wayne Kramer's remarkable ""Crossing Over"", as a sincere attempt to humanize the real problem of illegal immigration in the United States, and to remind us that many nationalities are a part of the situation, with some immigrants, in our country nearly all their lives, fulfilling all of the obligations of American citizens, except for actually being citizens. For those who see every person illegally here as either enjoying a 'free ride' on law-abiding citizens, or plotting acts of terrorism, I hope this film will open their eyes to the bigger picture.Saying this, I have to admit that the film isn't entirely successful; in telling so many stories, Kramer is forced to nearly stereotype some characters, and tie up too neatly some of the subplots. While this doesn't hurt the more important plot elements, it does lessen the film's credibility, somewhat. And in only portraying sympathetic immigrants, it does paint an occasionally unflattering picture of the our immigration services, which isn't entirely fair; this is a problem of epic proportions, and the agents trying to enforce the law are not villains with personal agendas, they are simply doing the job they were hired to do.The multiple storylines involve a veteran agent (Harrison Ford, who was never better), searching to find a young mother he helped deport, to reunite her with her son; a young British atheist (Jim Sturgess), forced to return to his Jewish roots to stay in country on religious grounds; an outspoken Islamic girl (Summer Bishil), threatening her whole family's future by simply saying in a classroom that the 9/11 terrorists had a reason for resorting to violence; a Korean boy (Justin Chon) endangering his family, by gang pressure to join in an armed robbery; an Islamic family, whose son (Cliff Curtis) is Ford's partner, overreacting to their daughter's relationship with a married non-believer;  a successful lawyer (Ashley Judd) hoping to adopt an orphaned African child; and her Immigration Department husband (Ray Liotta, in one of his less-likable roles), 'buying' an young Australian actress (Alice Eve) and her favors, in exchange for a new green card. While the stories have interconnecting characters, they are not locked as firmly together as ""Crash"", and other recent multi-story films, and the Judd subplot gets a bit shortchanged, while the Liotta one occasionally seems little more than an excuse to repeatedly show Eve's exquisite nude body. There are, however, powerful moments in the other storylines, that help offset this.""Crossing Over"" is not perfect, but it is an important film...and should be seen, more than once.",4,"Involving, Bittersweet Stories of Illegal Immigrants...",1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,2676,"['Let', 'say', 'beginning', 'admire', 'Wayne', 'Kramer', 'remarkable', 'Crossing', 'sincere', 'attempt', 'humanize', 'real', 'problem', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'United', 'States', 'remind', 'many', 'nationalities', 'are', 'part', 'situation', 'immigrants', 'country', 'nearly', 'lives', 'fulfilling', 'obligations', 'American', 'citizens', 'actually', 'being', 'citizens', 'who', 'see', 'person', 'illegally', 'here', 'enjoying', ""'free"", 'ride', 'law-abiding', 'citizens', 'plotting', 'acts', 'terrorism', 'hope', 'film', 'will', 'open', 'eyes', 'bigger', 'picture.Saying', 'have', 'admit', 'film', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'successful', 'telling', 'so', 'many', 'stories', 'Kramer', 'forced', 'nearly', 'stereotype', 'characters', 'tie', 'up', 'too', 'neatly', 'subplots', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'more', 'important', 'plot', 'elements', 'lessen', 'film', 'credibility', 'somewhat', 'only', 'portraying', 'sympathetic', 'immigrants', 'paint', 'occasionally', 'unflattering', 'picture', 'immigration', 'services', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'fair', 'problem', 'epic', 'proportions', 'agents', 'trying', 'enforce', 'law', 'are', 'not', 'villains', 'personal', 'agendas', 'are', 'simply', 'doing', 'job', 'were', 'hired', 'do.The', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'involve', 'veteran', 'agent', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'better', 'searching', 'find', 'young', 'mother', 'helped', 'deport', 'reunite', 'son', 'young', 'British', 'atheist', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'forced', 'return', 'Jewish', 'roots', 'stay', 'country', 'religious', 'grounds', 'outspoken', 'Islamic', 'girl', 'Summer', 'Bishil', 'threatening', 'whole', 'family', 'future', 'simply', 'saying', 'classroom', '9/11', 'terrorists', 'had', 'reason', 'resorting', 'violence', 'Korean', 'boy', 'Justin', 'Chon', 'endangering', 'family', 'gang', 'pressure', 'join', 'armed', 'robbery', 'Islamic', 'family', 'son', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'Ford', 'partner', 'overreacting', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'married', 'non-believer', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'hoping', 'adopt', 'orphaned', 'African', 'child', 'Immigration', 'Department', 'husband', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'one', 'less-likable', 'roles', ""'buying"", 'young', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'favors', 'exchange', 'new', 'green', 'card', 'stories', 'have', 'interconnecting', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'locked', 'firmly', 'together', 'Crash', 'other', 'recent', 'multi-story', 'films', 'Judd', 'subplot', 'bit', 'shortchanged', 'Liotta', 'one', 'occasionally', 'little', 'more', 'excuse', 'repeatedly', 'show', 'Eve', 'exquisite', 'nude', 'body', 'are', 'however', 'powerful', 'moments', 'other', 'storylines', 'help', 'offset', 'Crossing', 'not', 'perfect', 'important', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'once']",Crossing Over

With skillful directing, this movie takes us inside the lives of U.S. Immigration agents and several legal and illegal immigrants, telling each of their stories from a unique perspective.  Harrison Ford takes a nice turn as a conflicted immigration agent torn between duty and morality, who sees each immigration story as unique and shows more heart than most of his fellow officers.

This film probably did not do very well in theatrical release because of the very difficult subject matter with which it confronts the audience: few people who go to the movies to escape the realities of life outside elect to be disturbed.  CROSSING OVER, as written and directed by Wayne Kramer, forces us to learn just how treacherous the matter of immigration is on every level - from the border incidents, to document fraud, to worksite enforcement/raiding, to the concept of asylum, to naturalization, the green card process, the problematic office of counter terrorism, and finally to the basic cultural clashes that pit compassionate law officers against red neck raider type officers.To absorb the intricately woven aspects of the script, a script that addresses immigration issues dealing with Koreans, Africans, Iranians, Australians, Mexicans, and Jewish/atheist Britishers, the audience must pay close attention lest the subtleties be lost in the swirling nonstop drama.  Harrison Ford as the compassionate, burned out immigration officer Max Brogan holds the film together as he attempts to make sense of the various irregularities in every aspect of the immigration process. His partner is Iranian American  Hamid (a particularly fine performance by Cliff Curtis) who faces family problems with his American born sister and his father who is on the brink of naturalization - one of the many subplots that involves 'honor killing'.  Another man Cole Frankel (Ray Liotta is a smarmy role) reveals another view of a 'bad agent' while his wife Denise (Ashley Judd) fights for the rights of an African orphan held for 23 months awaiting sponsorship. A brave Iranian girl Taslima (Summer Bishil) speaks out for the rights of Muslims to be heard  and plunges her family into deportation problems.  Among the other subplots are stories about a Korean family whose one son (Justin Chon) is forced into gang warfare, an Australian actress (Alice Eve) who must secure her green card through sexual favors with Cole Frankel, a Mexican mother Mireya (Alice Braga) who is captured during a raid at a workplace and befriended by Max Brogan, and young British musician (Jim Sturgess) who must convince authorities of his 'Jewishness' in order to maintain a job that will result in a  green card.Each of these stories represents an aspect of our current dysfunctional system management of immigration.  The film does not take sides: it merely presents a smattering of the atrocities and imperfectly managed departments of government that together form a system that is chaotic.  Of interest, Sean Penn (listed as being in the cast on this page of Amazon.com) requested his small role be cut because of the objections of Iranian-American groups over the use of the 'honor killing' subplot.  That may indicate how many people may view this film: the story will either anger or disgust some viewers.

With 5 intersecting storylines colliding and converging in this piece, it's no easy task to juggle them all, and director Wayne Kramer does an excellent job.  It's hard to not compare this to other films of similar ilk, but CROSSING OVER definitely stands on its own.  Throw in a bit of Steve Soderbergh's Traffic as well - it must be the LA heat and Mexican border! - and you have a gritty if sobering drama to watch.This is the kind of role that Harrison Ford excels in.  He's serious as an immigration agent but appropriately so.  The entire cast works very well - from Ashley Judd to Ray Liotta to Jim Sturgess to Cliff Curtis and  blonde Aussie newcomer? Alice Eve - who looks like Reese Witherspoon stacked on a supermodel's body.The film weaves in a little Hollywood police thriller riff - unlike Babel or even Traffic - which grounds CROSSING OVER in a certain formula - and somehow, justice gets served Hollywood style at the end.  But the larger issues and harsher realities of being American, seeking identity and the world today, still come across by the film's open ended conclusion.PS - SEAN PENN DOES NOT APPEAR IN THIS FILM.

1238686,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B001UDS4BS,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","This movie takes on the subject of immigration...both legal and illegal, and immigrants.  It tells separate, but sometimes overlapping stories, so there is not really one overriding plot.  It touches not only on attempts to get into the country, but attempts to stay in the country after being here.  It also touches on how even people who are Americans are not always assimilated into the culture.The movie explores issues of racism, gang violence, extremest religion, fraud on the immigration system and within the system and more.  It has a tone and pacing of the movie is much like Traffic and Crash.  Even though there are multiple stories going on that are not really connected, the movie does flow well and does not get boring.  I think the two most compelling stories in the movie were the Muslim teenager who gives a speech at school about understanding the 9/11 hijackers and the consequences of that, and the one involving the family of Harrison Ford's INS partner.This movie is definitely not going to appeal to everyone.  Immigration is a touchy subject anyway, and the issues it hits aside from the illegal immigrant parts are ones that cause a lot of debate.  I think the filmmakers did a good job making a movie that would spark discussion and debate.  And although you could definitely tell the tone that they were trying to convey in each of the stories I do not think the movie came off as too preachy either on the side of all illegal immigrants should be deported, or everyone should be granted asylum side.  I would say that the overall tone is closer to the latter than the former, neither viewpoint was totally thrown at you.  Harrison Ford's character was the perfect example.  He spends the entire movie looking for a woman that he rounds up for deportation early in the movie, but is still doing the same job at the end of the movie.Liking this kind of movie will be very subjective.  If you like movies like Traffic, Crash and Gran Torino, this one is worth taking a look at.  Even if it is just a rental.  There is a lot of bad language and nudity in the film, so if those will offend you then you are better off skipping this.",5,Very good,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,2156,"['movie', 'subject', 'immigration', 'legal', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'separate', 'sometimes', 'overlapping', 'stories', 'not', 'really', 'one', 'overriding', 'plot', 'not', 'only', 'attempts', 'get', 'country', 'stay', 'country', 'being', 'here', 'also', 'how', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'Americans', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'assimilated', 'culture.The', 'movie', 'issues', 'racism', 'gang', 'violence', 'extremest', 'religion', 'fraud', 'immigration', 'system', 'system', 'more', 'tone', 'pacing', 'movie', 'much', 'Traffic', 'Crash', 'Even', 'are', 'multiple', 'stories', 'going', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'connected', 'movie', 'flow', 'well', 'not', 'get', 'boring', 'think', 'two', 'most', 'compelling', 'stories', 'movie', 'were', 'Muslim', 'teenager', 'who', 'speech', 'school', 'understanding', '9/11', 'hijackers', 'consequences', 'one', 'involving', 'family', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'INS', 'partner.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'going', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'Immigration', 'touchy', 'subject', 'anyway', 'issues', 'aside', 'illegal', 'immigrant', 'parts', 'are', 'ones', 'cause', 'lot', 'debate', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'movie', 'would', 'spark', 'discussion', 'debate', 'could', 'definitely', 'tell', 'tone', 'were', 'trying', 'convey', 'stories', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'movie', 'came', 'off', 'too', 'preachy', 'side', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'should', 'be', 'deported', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'granted', 'asylum', 'side', 'would', 'say', 'overall', 'tone', 'closer', 'latter', 'former', 'viewpoint', 'was', 'totally', 'thrown', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'character', 'was', 'perfect', 'example', 'entire', 'movie', 'looking', 'woman', 'up', 'deportation', 'early', 'movie', 'still', 'doing', 'same', 'job', 'end', 'movie.Liking', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'subjective', 'like', 'movies', 'Traffic', 'Crash', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'one', 'taking', 'look', 'Even', 'just', 'rental', 'lot', 'bad', 'language', 'nudity', 'film', 'so', 'will', 'offend', 'then', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'skipping']",Crossing Over

But to me when I buy a movie by Harrison Ford I expect top notch acting and a script that Hollywood money can afford and the right knowledge of how to make it all happen.  The end result is supposed to leave me feeling highly entertained and look forward to watching it again some day, because after all thats why I bought it, not rented or borrowed it from a local library.  In the case of this movie I wish I had gotten it for free from the Library instead of wasting my money on it.  Its all drama, all tear jerking drama. I wanted to be entertained, not dramatized!  After viewing it I put it in the ""to sell"" pile, not on the shelf.

I might as well watch a video of the day we buried my beloved Mother!  Meaning simply: you dont need a movie to remind you of some things, you just don't!!!  so I give 2 stars, only reason I dont give it just one star is because Harrison Ford does act well, but there's just no story, its all just a bunch of situations designed to give you grief!

Zwick,"[7, 10]","**1/2Here we go again - yet another of those multi-storied social dramas set in the racial and cultural crazy-quilt that is modern-day Los Angeles.  Falling somewhere on the quality scale between the profound ""Grand Canyon"" on the one end and the dreadful ""Crash"" on the other, ""Crossing Over"" relates a half dozen or so interlocking tales centered around the issue of immigration.Harrison Ford is a compassionate INS agent who goes beyond the call of duty to help an undocumented single mother and her young son; Ashley Judd is an immigration defense attorney who wants to adopt a young African girl who's already spent 23 months in a detention center, the victim of a mountain of bureaucratic red tape; and Melody Khazae is a Muslim high school student whose seeming sympathy for the jihadist cause may make it impossible for her to remain in the country.  And as if to prove that not all targets of immigration policy are ethnic minorities, Alice Eve is a blonde Australian actress who's having a dickens of a time renewing her visitor's visa.  Also in the cast is Ray Liotta as an unprincipled, opportunistic adjudications officer who agrees to smooth over the actress`s visa-renewal problems if she`ll only sleep with him.Though no one can deny that it starts off with the best of intentions, ""Crossing Over"" leaves much to be desired both as a human drama and as a social document.  In an effort to weave the disparate narrative strands into a coherent whole,  writer/director Wayne Kramer has intercut his scenes with endless birds`-eye-views of the city, a technique that does little to enhance the fluidity of the storytelling.  And despite the best efforts of a dedicated cast, the movie never inspires us to care about the people or issues it`s laying out before us.  In fact, ""Crossing Over"" errs in the opposite direction of the overwrought ""Crash"" by rarely displaying any genuine passion for its subject, seeming instead to be simply going through the motions to make its points.Perhaps as a result of the limited screen time allotted to each character, no one individual emerges from the pack to engage our sympathy or interest.  The characters feel more like pawns in a polemicist's exercise than fully-rounded people in their own right.

1238702,A3AF82E6Y0J0SJ,B001UDS4BS,Ryle Shermatz,"[1, 1]","Well, let me say first that I'm continually disappointed by all the reviewers who have nothing better to do than pour venom on movies that have offended them somehow.  I freely concede that bad movies can and do get made but I question the motivations of reviewers whose level of vitriolic reaction is shockingly disproportional to the actual offense any movie can realistically commit.  Speaking for myself, I'm NOT going to waste readers' time ripping a movie I think is bad; no matter what I say everyone of us is going to have to endure an occasional clinker from time to time, and shouting my angry opinions at you is only going to make me look maladjusted at best.All of which leads me into my full-throated recommendation of ""Crossing Over"".  Intrigued by the synopsis and cast, I took a chance on this and was powerfully rewarded with an outstanding ensemble drama that ought to provoke all sorts of reflection about our national immigration crisis as well as to stir our own thoughts about just what it means to be an American.First, GREAT performances by both the stars and the unknowns sharing the screen here.  Harrison Ford is appropriately bedraggled and exhausted as a seen-it-all ICE officer whose conscience forces him to look beyond his enforcer duties and try to ameliorate at least some of the human damage his job inflicts.  Check out how he's got his ""Blade Runner"" square scotch glass back in a similar alone-at-home scene, examining both case history evidence as well as his own moral compass.  Ashley Judd & Ray Liotta are as sharp as ever, portraying a husband/wife on opposite ends of the immigration spectrum: Ashley as an immigration attorney, struggling to help families at the mercy of the Federal immigration sausage grinder, and Ray as a jaded & corrupt bureaucrat sinking to his personal lowest as a bent cog in that very system.  Anchored by these seasoned pros, the rest of the cast dials into their frequency, powerfully depicting the endless sour treadmill of immigration cat-and-mouse as a tragedy diminishing the humanity of all trapped within its jaws.So many things grabbed me in ""Crossing Over""; first was the dilemma of the illegal Saudi teenager who put her entire family at risk by provoking her high school class with an unbelievably inflammatory speech.  YES she should have known better, but I almost immediately thought (and this was surely the directors' intent) ""it is just the nature of teenagers to say and do risky, ill-considered things"".  Here we are challenged by the outrageously disproportional official response: would we approve of such a bare-knuckled official smackdown of a native kid who (for example) dropped a cherry bomb into the school's plumbing, or spray painted a swastika?  Is it ""justice"" or is it brutish tyranny to respond so vindictively to teenage provocation like this?I must also comment quickly on the ""honor killing"" depicted here.  ""Crossing Over"" depicts the problems of assimilation vividly through conflict boiling beneath the surface of an outwardly ""model"" Iranian family on the verge of naturalization.  Children raised and grown to maturity here are going to be imprinted with values and cultural ""frames"" vastly different from those their parents (or elder siblings) were born into.  It's an understatement to say that this will provoke intense generational conflict, and while these tensions(thankfully) seldom lead to murder, unfortunately such things are not impossible or unprecedented.  Here again, outstanding ensemble acting dramatizes the conflict and its causes very effectively, sketching all perspectives without artificially tugging our sympathies one way or another.Implicit throughout ""Crossing Over"" is the question ""what does it MEAN to be an American-a US Citizen-when so many outside our country are prepared to risk so much to live in the shadows among us, where they can all too easily find themselves targets of the nation they gambled EVERYTHING to be part of?""  Obviously this is and should be a penetrating cause for self-examination on all possible fronts for each of us lucky enough to be Americans by birth.  How DO the ideals our nation was founded on perpetuate and express themselves when challenged by outsiders who aspire to those same yearnings?  No easy answers but you simply cannot see ""Crossing Over"" without these dilemmas tugging at your personal sense of who you are and what you contribute to our nation.It's fair to say that ""Crossing Over"" indeed owes a great deal in many respects to predecessors like ""Crash (Widescreen Edition),Amores Perros,21 Grams, orTraffic"".  However, each of those was a great, absorbing, and important cinematic work of art in every meaningful sense.  Despite its stylistic similarities, I don't think ""Crossing Over"" should be diminished by comparison; indeed, if you haven't already, see all of them.""Crossing Over"" never really had a fair chance in theaters to find an audience.  I hope my praise can lead a few receptive readers to take a chance and be as amazed as I was by this arresting and consequential film.",4,Unflinching & Recommended,1249171200,"08 2,

This will most likely be one of the best films no one saw this year with only a 40 theater slate and no advertising (it did not make any of the distribution posters, no marketing). The only press it did get was Sean Penn having his fit and being removed from the film's cut altogether. The DVD cover art and description has nothing to do with the film, and the usual Weinstein bare bones DVD on what should have been a packed product.This Southern California ensemble piece covers an intertwined variety of topics and story lines over the course of a couple weeks. Immigration, racism, peer pressure, and a failing system filled with both passionate and immoral servants, make up this Crash-esque film. Too much gets crammed in to these two hours as there are 14 main characters and 10 supporting. No one has significant screen time over the other, so this is not a Harrison Ford, Ray Liotta or Ashley Judd film (as the cover would make you think). It is a character film about sensitive topics that you will disagree with, maybe support or feel indifferent towards as they are all thrown across the screen.It is a very good film, and nothing about the post-production press should deter one from seeing a solid character performance on everyone's part, albeit some of the roles disappear as fast as they appear (especially Lizzy Caplan's bookend role - loved her in True Blood and My Best Friend's Girl).The picture clarity is excellent throughout, the city scapes and large volume of overhead pans all looked professional and articulate (would be very worthy on BD). The 5.1 only fooled me only once so it mostly gets used with the score and there are no special features.

Is it right for the U.S to play World Police and take out young innocent women and children just to liberate a country or attempt to establish a stable government for a country that has had political chaos for 1000's of years, certainly not. Is it right that Arab(Middle eastern) terrorists took out the world trade centers with our own planes in an attempt to justify there believes and kill a few thousand of our men, women and children, absolutely not.So who's wrong and who's right, well no one really and this film really doesn't touch base on either one being right or wrong. But on the other hand Ashely Judd defending a young girl who gets up in front of the class of her high school, saying that her Arab brothers were justified in doing what they did to us, and we just don't understand is down right appalling. Also the areas of our so called prejudice against illegal aliens in this country was jumbled up and mismatched as well. The film overall was pretty much a mess, it was interesting to certain issues touched on, but they have already been done in several other films. Mexican gangs, Arab Terrorists, and people crossing our borders into the U.S is a problem, but this movie does nothing to rectify and of these problems, but does nothing more than either glorify them or just confuse the viewer on who thinks what. Fords performance and even presence in the film felt more like he was just going through the motions and showed no real interest in the topic at hand. I think he's becoming desperate to keep himself on the big screen since he's aging and not a lot of people find him very interesting anymore. So the movie itself takes itself way to seriously and literal. I agree that we should protect our country, and to some extent other countries have a right to do so as well. But also there is a creative balance on how to handle it. You wouldnt want someone coming into your home and trying to change what you believe, but also you wouldnt go terrorize the world to force it down someones throat, or start killing people to prove it. So when you watch the film, you may find yourself extremely confused, i know i did, and i didnt like it.P.S-bringing up the whole 911 issue by bashing a veiled Arab girl in a class room was just ridiculous, no teacher or school would tolerate such outbursts, no matter what race the child was. Very ludicrous. And yes someone like that should be flagged(Ashley Judd) shame on you for defending such trash. Also yes American can be just as bad, look at Vietnam, most of the time we are just to stupid to realize we have been terrorists to, Heroshima anyone?",2,"Pretty distorted and mixed up views, the movie has no direction",1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,2732,"['Well', 'people', 'U.S', 'do', 'need', 'ask', 'where', 'bounderies', 'borders', 'lie', 'country', 'others', 'right', 'U.S', 'play', 'World', 'Police', 'take', 'out', 'young', 'innocent', 'women', 'children', 'just', 'liberate', 'country', 'attempt', 'establish', 'stable', 'government', 'country', 'had', 'political', 'chaos', '1000', 'years', 'certainly', 'not', 'right', 'Arab', 'Middle', 'eastern', 'terrorists', 'took', 'out', 'world', 'trade', 'centers', 'own', 'planes', 'attempt', 'justify', 'kill', 'few', 'thousand', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'absolutely', 'who', 'wrong', 'who', 'right', 'well', 'one', 'really', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'touch', 'base', 'one', 'being', 'right', 'wrong', 'other', 'hand', 'Ashely', 'Judd', 'defending', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'front', 'class', 'high', 'school', 'saying', 'Arab', 'brothers', 'were', 'justified', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'down', 'right', 'appalling', 'Also', 'areas', 'so', 'called', 'prejudice', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'country', 'was', 'jumbled', 'up', 'mismatched', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'overall', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'mess', 'was', 'interesting', 'certain', 'issues', 'touched', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'Mexican', 'gangs', 'Arab', 'Terrorists', 'people', 'crossing', 'borders', 'U.S', 'problem', 'movie', 'nothing', 'rectify', 'problems', 'nothing', 'more', 'glorify', 'just', 'confuse', 'viewer', 'who', 'what', 'Fords', 'performance', 'even', 'presence', 'film', 'felt', 'more', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'showed', 'real', 'interest', 'topic', 'hand', 'think', 'becoming', 'desperate', 'keep', 'big', 'screen', 'aging', 'not', 'lot', 'people', 'find', 'very', 'interesting', 'anymore', 'movie', 'way', 'seriously', 'literal', 'agree', 'should', 'protect', 'country', 'extent', 'other', 'countries', 'have', 'right', 'do', 'so', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'creative', 'balance', 'how', 'handle', 'wouldnt', 'want', 'someone', 'coming', 'home', 'trying', 'change', 'what', 'believe', 'also', 'wouldnt', 'go', 'terrorize', 'world', 'force', 'down', 'someones', 'throat', 'start', 'killing', 'people', 'prove', 'So', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'may', 'find', 'extremely', 'confused', 'i', 'know', 'i', 'did', 'i', 'didnt', 'it.P.S-bringing', 'whole', '911', 'issue', 'bashing', 'veiled', 'Arab', 'girl', 'class', 'room', 'was', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'teacher', 'school', 'would', 'tolerate', 'such', 'outbursts', 'matter', 'what', 'race', 'child', 'was', 'Very', 'ludicrous', 'yes', 'someone', 'should', 'be', 'flagged', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'shame', 'defending', 'such', 'trash', 'Also', 'yes', 'American', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'bad', 'look', 'Vietnam', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'just', 'stupid', 'realize', 'have', 'been', 'terrorists', 'Heroshima', 'anyone']",Crossing Over

1238712,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001UDS4BS,Z Hayes,"[4, 5]","Honestly, the only reason I rented this movie was because it starred Harrison Ford, and I expected the usual from him. It turned out to be so much more, and though Ford does a good job in his role, it was the ensemble cast that delivered incredibly moving performances.Harrison Ford plays LA-based ICE agent Max Brogan whose job entails carrying out raids on places that employ undocumented aliens. In contrast to the demands of his job in pursuing and capturing the illegals, Max has a soft heart, following up on those illegals that he captures, especially in special cases. One such case involves a young Mexican alien [Alice Braga] who upon arrest, begs Max to check up on her young son, left in the care of a ruthless money-minded woman. Max refuses her, but later his conscience gets the better of him and he gets the boy back to his grandparents in Mexico, only to find the mother has gone missing.This is one of the many story arcs that fuse this complex movie together, ala Crash, Traffic, Babel etc, but never throughout the movie, did I find this confusing. In fact, the story arcs all come together eventually, and the result is one gripping, emotionally powerful movie. There is the story of a Korean family where the eldest son is facing an identity crisis of sorts, soon to be naturalized yet not really appreciating its significance, much to his father's disappointment. There's the British Jewish guy who aspires to be a singer but finds himself desperate to get legal status, resorting to working in a Jewish school though he considers himself an atheist. There's the young Aussie actress [Alice Eve] hoping to make it big in America, but overstaying her visit, and finding herself at the mercy of an unscrupulous immigration adjudicator [Ray Liotta in yet another sleazeball role]. Ashley Judd [also playing Liotta's clueless wife] plays a compassionate immigration attorney who expends all her efforts helping those who need her services. One such person is 15-year-old Taslima, a Muslim girl [Summer Bishil of ""Towelhead"" delivering an emotionally gut-wrenching performance] who is taken into custody by the Feds because of a controversial paper she wrote in school about the 9/11 suicide bombers, a paper that sympathizes with the courage [though not the motives] of the killers. Being an undocumented alien, she and her undocumented parents face imminent deportation, leaving her family's future uncertain.And finally, there's another story arc that deals with an Iranian American woman who faces the disapproval of her conservative family over her overly Westernized way of life. She also happens to be Max's partner's sister, and when she is found murdered, other facts come to light which causes Max to question his partner's motives.It may appear that there are too many story arcs here to merit sufficient development or characterization, but I found the stories were well-told, the characters as played by the actors were credibly developed and portrayed and the stories eventually blended well together, engaging my attention on an intellectual and emotional level.There are no absolute happy endings here, but a mixture of pleasing outcomes together with the tragic. It is one of the most riveting, thought-provoking dramas I've seen this year.",5,"Intense, thought-provoking movie about immigration issues",1246579200,"07 3, 2009",2009,3275,"['Honestly', 'only', 'reason', 'rented', 'movie', 'was', 'starred', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'expected', 'usual', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Ford', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'was', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'delivered', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'performances.Harrison', 'Ford', 'LA-based', 'ICE', 'agent', 'Max', 'Brogan', 'job', 'carrying', 'out', 'raids', 'places', 'employ', 'undocumented', 'aliens', 'contrast', 'demands', 'job', 'pursuing', 'capturing', 'illegals', 'Max', 'soft', 'heart', 'following', 'up', 'illegals', 'especially', 'special', 'cases', 'One', 'such', 'case', 'young', 'Mexican', 'alien', '[', 'Alice', 'Braga', ']', 'who', 'arrest', 'begs', 'Max', 'check', 'up', 'young', 'son', 'left', 'care', 'ruthless', 'money-minded', 'woman', 'Max', 'later', 'conscience', 'better', 'boy', 'back', 'grandparents', 'Mexico', 'only', 'find', 'mother', 'gone', 'missing.This', 'one', 'many', 'story', 'arcs', 'fuse', 'complex', 'movie', 'together', 'ala', 'Crash', 'Traffic', 'Babel', 'etc', 'never', 'movie', 'did', 'find', 'confusing', 'fact', 'story', 'come', 'together', 'eventually', 'result', 'one', 'gripping', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'movie', 'story', 'Korean', 'family', 'where', 'eldest', 'son', 'facing', 'identity', 'crisis', 'sorts', 'soon', 'be', 'naturalized', 'yet', 'not', 'really', 'appreciating', 'significance', 'much', 'father', 'disappointment', 'British', 'Jewish', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'singer', 'desperate', 'get', 'legal', 'status', 'resorting', 'working', 'Jewish', 'school', 'atheist', 'young', 'Aussie', 'actress', '[', 'Alice', 'Eve', ']', 'hoping', 'make', 'big', 'America', 'overstaying', 'visit', 'finding', 'mercy', 'unscrupulous', 'immigration', 'adjudicator', '[', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'yet', 'sleazeball', 'role', ']', 'Ashley', 'Judd', '[', 'also', 'playing', 'Liotta', 'clueless', 'wife', ']', 'compassionate', 'immigration', 'attorney', 'who', 'efforts', 'helping', 'who', 'need', 'services', 'One', 'such', 'person', '15-year-old', 'Taslima', 'Muslim', 'girl', '[', 'Summer', 'Bishil', 'Towelhead', 'delivering', 'emotionally', 'gut-wrenching', 'performance', ']', 'who', 'taken', 'custody', 'Feds', 'controversial', 'paper', 'wrote', 'school', '9/11', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'paper', 'courage', '[', 'not', 'motives', ']', 'killers', 'Being', 'undocumented', 'alien', 'undocumented', 'parents', 'face', 'imminent', 'deportation', 'leaving', 'family', 'future', 'uncertain.And', 'finally', 'story', 'arc', 'deals', 'Iranian', 'American', 'woman', 'who', 'disapproval', 'conservative', 'family', 'overly', 'Westernized', 'way', 'life', 'also', 'be', 'Max', 'partner', 'sister', 'when', 'found', 'murdered', 'other', 'facts', 'come', 'light', 'Max', 'question', 'partner', 'motives.It', 'may', 'appear', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'story', 'arcs', 'here', 'merit', 'sufficient', 'development', 'characterization', 'found', 'stories', 'were', 'well-told', 'characters', 'played', 'actors', 'were', 'credibly', 'developed', 'portrayed', 'stories', 'eventually', 'blended', 'well', 'together', 'engaging', 'attention', 'intellectual', 'emotional', 'level.There', 'are', 'absolute', 'happy', 'endings', 'here', 'mixture', 'pleasing', 'outcomes', 'together', 'tragic', 'one', 'most', 'riveting', 'thought-provoking', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year']",Crossing Over
