285618,A22IK3I6U76GX0,6301976576,Calle,"[6, 8]","The best thing about this movie is 80-year-old Bette Davis' performance. But she's also the movie's biggest problem. When the producers refused to change the script after her demands, she left the set, after one week of filming. That forced director/screenwriter Larry Cohen to rewrite the script to explain her disappearance, which resulted in a very confusing plot (she transformed herself into her daughter or a cat or something like that, I didn't quite get it...). Well, at least it's a better solution than Edward D. Wood Jr.'s way of replacing Bela Lugosi in ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (using a stand-in that doesn't look the least like Lugosi, covering his face with a cape).The first half-hour or so is quite entertaining. Davis is overacting in a good way as Jenny's (Colleen Camp) father's new creepy wife, Miranda. After she's out of the movie, it's quite confusing. Miranda left the family and her daughter, Priscilla (who is Miranda in another shape or something, eh...) is staying with the family instead.There are some good humor in the movie. There's one funny scene in the beginning, at the police station, with the lineup with the angry old homeless ladies. Some scenes are just silly, like the beach sequence somewhere before the middle of the movie.So, Bette Davis' performance is what makes this movie worth watching, but she's also the main reason it's so bad (I guess it wouldn't have been a great movie anyway, but less confusing). The other actors are quite mediocre. However, the movie isn't quite as bad as its reputation.

David Rasche underplays it completely, while Coleen Camp, as his wife, is here guilty of near-hysterical overacting.

And then to top it off she was only in it in the beginning then Barbara Carrera takes over. In a sense it is really stupid. Bette is a witch who share the body of  a cat with Barbara. Only one can be out at a time. Both of them are bad witches. As a old woman witch, Bette marries men to make them rich & then shrinks them to get the money.

The story line was cute and kept me interested.  This is definately a movie for those who likes a lot of wacky and fantasy with their comedy.,4,Silly but entertaining,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,247,"['Seeing', 'Betty', 'Davis', 'part', 'was', 'refreshing', 'know', 'still', 'was', 'grand', 'actress', 'later', 'years', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'cute', 'kept', 'interested', 'definately', 'movie', 'who', 'likes', 'lot', 'wacky', 'fantasy', 'comedy']",N/A
