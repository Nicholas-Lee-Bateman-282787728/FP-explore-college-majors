A story about experiece and vulnerability!""A Friend Of Dorothy"" portrays a common dilemma many gay and bi-sexual people experience at some point in their life: the intense attraction towards someone whom is heterosexual. Sensitively examined, this story truly left me feeling moved!""The Disco Years"" shows another version of a no-win situation: getting involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation, but is also terrified of being exposed as anything other than straight! A very empowering story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person!While these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy towards others, they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay, bi-sexual or searching!

The leading characters are certainly quite nice to look at. You won't be disappointed by the view. I enjoyed the whole thing for the most part and can't really think of anything I would want to point out as ""less than desireable"". My only beef with this collection is that the stories are very short. Just when it seems that things are fixing to heat up to steaming, the stories end leaving me wanting more. Each short story leaves you with something to fantasize about in your own mind as you create your own sequel. I will be buying this entire collection of ""Boy's Life"" films. I'm hooked!

Though directed by three different people, these three episodes share the same budgetary limitations and basic point-and-shoot style, all of which serves to roughen their edges a little.Brian Sloan's POOL DAYS (USA - 1993) follows the exploits of a young pool attendant who tries to suppress the feelings generated by the semi-clad beefcake which surrounds him in his otherwise dull job, before finally coming to terms with his sexuality with the help of a regular visitor to the pool (gorgeous, naturally) who takes a shine to him. It's a likable, sexy film, but it seems to end abruptly, leaving a couple of unresolved situations in its wake.Raoul O'Connell directs A FRIEND OF DOROTHY (USA - 1994) and casts himself as a nerdy college freshman who's seeking Mr. Right, whilst secretly pining for his apparently straight roommate. Sadly, O'Connell affects a range of tics and mannerisms which translate as geeky rather than appealing, though his film is competently constructed.And finally, Robert Lee King's THE DISCO YEARS (USA - 1991) depicts the trials of a seriously cute high school student who longs to be accepted by his homophobic peers until their cruelty eventually forces him to confront his true sexual identity.Many of the situations depicted in all three films have a ring of truth about them, and each story offers its own heartfelt commentary on the lives of young gay men in America, despite the penny-pinching production values.Followed by BOYS LIFE 2 (1998).",3,Calling card for talented directors,950486400,"02 14, 2000",2000,1654,"['BOYS', 'LIFE', 'THREE', 'STORIES', 'OF', 'LOVE', 'LUST', 'AND', 'LIBERATION', 'USA', '1995', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.37:1Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'MonoCompilation', 'short', 'gay', 'films', 'theme', ""'coming"", 'out', 'directed', 'three', 'different', 'people', 'three', 'episodes', 'share', 'same', 'budgetary', 'limitations', 'basic', 'point-and-shoot', 'style', 'roughen', 'edges', 'little.Brian', 'Sloan', 'POOL', 'DAYS', 'USA', '1993', 'exploits', 'young', 'pool', 'attendant', 'who', 'suppress', 'feelings', 'generated', 'semi-clad', 'beefcake', 'otherwise', 'dull', 'job', 'finally', 'coming', 'terms', 'sexuality', 'help', 'regular', 'visitor', 'pool', 'gorgeous', 'naturally', 'who', 'shine', 'likable', 'sexy', 'film', 'end', 'abruptly', 'leaving', 'couple', 'unresolved', 'situations', 'wake.Raoul', ""O'Connell"", 'A', 'FRIEND', 'OF', 'DOROTHY', 'USA', '1994', 'nerdy', 'college', 'freshman', 'who', 'seeking', 'Mr', 'Right', 'secretly', 'pining', 'apparently', 'straight', 'roommate', 'Sadly', ""O'Connell"", 'range', 'tics', 'mannerisms', 'translate', 'geeky', 'rather', 'appealing', 'film', 'competently', 'constructed.And', 'finally', 'Robert', 'Lee', 'King', 'THE', 'DISCO', 'YEARS', 'USA', '1991', 'trials', 'seriously', 'cute', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'be', 'accepted', 'homophobic', 'peers', 'cruelty', 'eventually', 'confront', 'true', 'sexual', 'identity.Many', 'situations', 'depicted', 'three', 'films', 'have', 'ring', 'truth', 'story', 'own', 'heartfelt', 'commentary', 'lives', 'young', 'gay', 'men', 'America', 'penny-pinching', 'production', 'values.Followed', 'BOYS', 'LIFE', '2', '1998']","Boys Life - Three Tales of Love, Lust & Liberation VHS"
