With the setting they had the cinematography could have been breathtaking, it isn't.  The technology existed in 1987.  But this is a poorly shot movie.Editing.  As poor as the filming was, the editing is very unpolished and poorly done, some might say choppy.Script.  The poor editing AND a poor script make this difficult to watch when Donahoe is NOT on screen.The characters.  Gerald, played gamely by Oliver Reed, is not a likeable person at all.  From the beginning he is clumsy and very odd.  Lucy, on the other hand is extremely likeable with or without clothing.Story.  With the hook this movie had, you would think they could have come up with a good script to go with this, but they didn't.  But maybe it was the poor direction and editing that ruined the story.We have an unarguably poorly made movie that is getting 4 and 5 star rating reviews.  Apparently the only thing that matter with this movie is that Amanda Donahoe is naked a large percentage of the movie.  So lets give her a 5, everything else a 1 or 2 and we end up with a 2 to 3 star movie.

239113,A332MW6OA1LYDF,6300273539,John Noodles,"[6, 6]","It's a familiar story:  &quot;Let's spend a year on a deserted island.&quot;  Oliver Reed and Amanda Donohoe are both great as the couple who do this...Reed places and ad, Donohoe answers it, they tumble into bed, and in a few months, they are dropped off at their island in the South Pacific.  It seems iyllic, and indeed it is, but things soon begin to fall apart.  Shortly after arriving, Reed's feet and legs swell, and he develops hideous, supurating sores all over them.  Donohoe becomes angry, shrewish, and pretty much stays that way.  We never know why, exactly, this happens--Donohoe thinks Reed is lazy; Reed just...loses his health.  Eventually, they become malnourished, but this can't be the reason for Reed's initial decline...they have plenty of food, at least at first.The couple's slow decline is just that--slow.  Donohoe's increasing shrewishness becomes tedious.  Still, it's an enjoyable movie.  Even though it leaves some questions naggingly unanswered, it also grabs the audience, and holds us, but allowing us to speculate on how *we* would react in such a situation.  After all, this movie's scenario is darn near every guy's fantasy:  stranded on a deserted island with a beautiful young woman who is almost always naked.  (Amanda Donohoe is not shy in this movie.) This, of course, is Reed's dream, too, and it becomes a nightmare.The movie is flawed, but enjoyable to watch.",4,Well Worth a Look,974592000,"11 19, 2000",2000,1403,"['familiar', 'story', 'quot', 'Let', 'spend', 'year', 'deserted', 'island.', 'quot', 'Oliver', 'Reed', 'Amanda', 'Donohoe', 'are', 'great', 'couple', 'who', 'do', 'Reed', 'places', 'ad', 'Donohoe', 'tumble', 'bed', 'few', 'months', 'are', 'dropped', 'island', 'South', 'Pacific', 'iyllic', 'indeed', 'things', 'soon', 'begin', 'fall', 'apart', 'Shortly', 'arriving', 'Reed', 'feet', 'legs', 'swell', 'hideous', 'supurating', 'sores', 'Donohoe', 'angry', 'shrewish', 'pretty', 'much', 'stays', 'way', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'exactly', 'Donohoe', 'thinks', 'Reed', 'lazy', 'Reed', 'just', 'health', 'Eventually', 'become', 'malnourished', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'reason', 'Reed', 'initial', 'decline', 'have', 'plenty', 'food', 'least', 'first.The', 'couple', 'slow', 'decline', 'just', 'slow', 'Donohoe', 'increasing', 'shrewishness', 'becomes', 'tedious', 'Still', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Even', 'questions', 'naggingly', 'unanswered', 'also', 'grabs', 'audience', 'allowing', 'speculate', 'how', '*we*', 'would', 'react', 'such', 'situation', 'movie', 'scenario', 'darn', 'guy', 'fantasy', 'stranded', 'deserted', 'island', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'almost', 'always', 'naked', 'Amanda', 'Donohoe', 'not', 'shy', 'movie', 'course', 'Reed', 'dream', 'too', 'nightmare.The', 'movie', 'flawed', 'enjoyable', 'watch']",N/A

239115,A2GHTSBU7IHIBO,6300273539,Owen Hughes,"[22, 23]","Some will say that this was a shoddy attempt to retell an old story and shouldn't have been put before the public. I say it is a very good essay at what is an increasingly new story, and should be watched, thought about and  digested by a wider audience than it has probably had.True, it is a  genuine R-rated movie, but I liked that part of this particular film. The  heroine threw her clothes off the moment she found herself an actual  castaway and had she done anything else, such as acting coy with the  camera, I doubt the effect would have been the same. So moving on beyond  the nudity, of which there is a genuine and, let's face it, realistic  sufficiency, what else is left? Making a film about two people trying the  experiment of getting far away from the traffic noise and the LOUD TVs AND  RADIOS of their former lives (and who can blame them!), cannot have been  easy. I mean, what do you do on the island? How do you cope with sudden  isolation? How do you react to the only other human being nearby? Do you do  anything at all, or do you laze the time away under the palm trees? And  most of all, do you change, perhaps grow, maybe learn something more about  yourself or the world or other people? All these questions and more are  asked and answers are attempted, making this a very thoughtful piece, which  at times reaches impressive heights of film-making. Sure we have to  struggle a bit with the ""plot,"" but so do the actors. It isn't easy, nor  should it be, doing what they have set out to do.It is also a film that  is full of nice touches, like the loud news casts in the beginning which  cause us to miss the (English) dialogue. The camera work is interesting  too; not too experimental and dangerous but occasionally playing with  images, especially goldfish (at the start) and water (on the island) that  pull us up and make us wonder. Another odd scene (and there are many scenes  which act as vignettes, asking you to pause and consider something in  particular) is that in which Donohoe settles down to read a copy of Colin  Wilson's ""A Criminal History of Mankind."" Now why do you think she's  reading that particular book on a desert island? Another scene shows them  both lying naked in the tent like a pair of skinny Biafran babies,  apparently waiting to die from sickness and lack of fresh food and water.  Interesting sketches of a life not quite like our own.I don't suppose it  will ever really be a film which is truly admired by a wide audience -  there's too much sex and not enough drugs and rock and roll for that. But  true cinephiles with an eye for the unusual will enjoy this movie with its  very strong portrayals by Amanda Donohoe and Oliver Reed. In fact, it's  worth the five stars just for making a good attempt at such a difficult  subject.
