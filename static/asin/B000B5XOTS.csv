It anchored the NBC lineup for years and even spawned a great spinoff upon its last episode.Sadly, these days, they don't make sitcoms as good as Cheers anymore.Season Seven of Cheers finds the gang hitting their stride with new cast member Kirstie Alley, who joined the cast a year earlier as new bar manager Rebecca Howe. Season seven features some memorable moments, but above all, plenty of chances to laugh.With the bar again changing hands and people moving up and down the corporate ladder, early in the year, Sam Malone (Ted Danson) Cheers' bartender and former owner, finds himself in charge again, while Rebecca finds herself out of a job. Throughout the year the relationship with Sam and Rebecca continues to sizzle, much like that of Sam and Diane in the earlier seasons. It is quite obvious that Sam is attracted to Rebecca, but the feeling certainly isn't mutual. However, the games are fun to watch as Sam tries everything in his book to get Rebecca out on a date.Carla (Rhea Perlman) celebrates two years of marriage to her husband, former hockey player turned ice show performer Eddie LeBec (guest star Jay Thomas). She also gets to experience the finer side of life thanks to an elegant dinner with Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) and his wife Lilith (guest star Bebe Neuwirth). Of course she wouldn't be Carla without her biting remarks, which are generally thrown in the direction of lonely mailman Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger).Cliff and Norm Peterson (George Wendt) continue to occupy their seats at the end of the bar, coming up with weird schemes and ideas to get back at their competitor's bar, or to avoid work, or to do just about anything. Cliff also finds love with a fellow postal carrier, only to have it snuffed out when he has to lie to protect her job and she leaves for Canada. Norm finds his calling as an interior decorator, though can't quite learn how to be gay to impress his yuppie clients.Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), Cheers' lovable but slow bartender, meets rich girl Kelly Gaines (guest star Jacky Swanson) at a party he is working at and the two fall in love. Though Woody has no money and Kelly is loaded, the two are almost a perfect match, as they seem to have the same simple minds, and they compliment each other very well. This relationship is one that continued for a number of years on the show.Frasier and Lilith also are on the cusp of becoming parents, as Lilith is pregnant with their son as the season comes to a close. They go through their normal bickering, as viewers of the show came to expect over the years. The two of them are great comic foils for each other and bring a level of sophistication to the bar, a welcome addition for sure.As has been the case with the last few seasons, there are no extras on this set, which is one of the reasons this doesn't get five stars. Additionally, there are a number of scenes that appear really, really dark, particularly on the first disc, though there is no reason for it.Also, look for a pre-Melrose appearance by future Desperate Housewife Marcia Cross.All in all, it is great to look back over these episodes and remember when television was capable of producing great sitcoms.

936039,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000B5XOTS,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[16, 21]","A small group of Bostonians once again congregate at Cheers to share and muse themselves over the oddities that take place within the walls of this basement bar. In the seventh season these people are spearheaded by the former baseball pro Sam Malone (Ted Danson) and the power-hungry Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) who came to the show in 1987.  In season seven these two continue to bang their heads with each other, as the season kicks off where season six ended.  Rebecca looses her beloved Evan Drake to Japan while her new boss gives Sam her job.  However, Rebecca finds a way to get back at Sam in a different episode, which amusingly backfires.The conflicting personalities of Sam and Rebecca would be too heavy to handle if it was not for their two best friends: the living with mom and trivia-spitting mailman Cliff (John Ratzenberger) and the beer enthusiastic conundrum Norman (George Wendt) whose wife nobody ever has seen.  The thoughtful psychiatrist Fraiser (Kelsey Grammar) brings contrast to the show with his objectively Freudian view on life.  The sarcastic waitress Carla (Rhea Perlman) continues to shoot sharp lines to those who irritate her, and everyone does.  There is also the kindhearted and mindless Woodrow Boyd (Woody Harrelson) who tries to jump into the conversations, but is with complete disconnection with the world.  Together these characters bring new life to the seventh season, as they become the wheels of the sitcom under motor of Sam and Rebecca's quarrelling.Cheers displays a well-written TV show that offers large amount of chuckles and laughter, as the environment of the bar fosters a sarcastic and quick-witted humor.  The different characters bring a backbone to the jokes and situational humor that allows for the audience to make personal connections.  Episodes such as ""Norm, is that You?"" and ""What's Up, Doc?"" allow the audience to connect with the characters in an hilarious manner, as Norm comes out as an interior decorator and Sam fakes impotence to get to know the aloof Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth).  All of the 22 episodes offer similar terrific humor that will have the audience laughing hard.  However, the seventh season shows signs of minute exhaustion, as it does not reach the same level of entertaining quality of previous season.Cheers - The Complete Seventh Season offers wonderful comic relief for an audience, especially if the viewer feels a little tired and drained.  Some episodes are better than others, but that is to be expected.  The seventh season seems to suffer a little from some performance fatigue.  It might be a consequence of having had this show on the air for seven years, as it might have caused the audience to become too familiar with the characters.  Thus, this may make many of the comic experiences feel a little repetitive.  Nonetheless, the seventh season offers a very good sitcom experience, which is a must see for Cheers fans and those who simply enjoy well-written humor.",4,"Excellent Sitcom, but not the Best Season...",1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,2975,"['small', 'group', 'Bostonians', 'once', 'again', 'congregate', 'Cheers', 'share', 'muse', 'oddities', 'take', 'place', 'walls', 'basement', 'bar', 'seventh', 'season', 'people', 'are', 'spearheaded', 'former', 'baseball', 'pro', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'power-hungry', 'Rebecca', 'Howe', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'who', 'came', 'show', '1987', 'season', 'seven', 'two', 'continue', 'bang', 'heads', 'other', 'season', 'off', 'where', 'season', 'six', 'ended', 'Rebecca', 'beloved', 'Evan', 'Drake', 'Japan', 'new', 'boss', 'Sam', 'job', 'However', 'Rebecca', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'Sam', 'different', 'episode', 'amusingly', 'backfires.The', 'conflicting', 'personalities', 'Sam', 'Rebecca', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'heavy', 'handle', 'was', 'not', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'living', 'mom', 'trivia-spitting', 'mailman', 'Cliff', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'beer', 'enthusiastic', 'conundrum', 'Norman', 'George', 'Wendt', 'wife', 'nobody', 'ever', 'seen', 'thoughtful', 'psychiatrist', 'Fraiser', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'contrast', 'show', 'objectively', 'Freudian', 'view', 'life', 'sarcastic', 'waitress', 'Carla', 'Rhea', 'Perlman', 'shoot', 'sharp', 'lines', 'who', 'irritate', 'everyone', 'also', 'kindhearted', 'mindless', 'Woodrow', 'Boyd', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'who', 'jump', 'conversations', 'complete', 'disconnection', 'world', 'Together', 'characters', 'bring', 'new', 'life', 'seventh', 'season', 'become', 'wheels', 'sitcom', 'motor', 'Sam', 'Rebecca', 'quarrelling.Cheers', 'well-written', 'TV', 'show', 'large', 'amount', 'chuckles', 'laughter', 'environment', 'bar', 'sarcastic', 'quick-witted', 'humor', 'different', 'characters', 'bring', 'backbone', 'jokes', 'situational', 'humor', 'audience', 'make', 'personal', 'connections', 'Episodes', 'such', 'Norm', 'What', 'Up', 'Doc', 'audience', 'connect', 'characters', 'hilarious', 'manner', 'Norm', 'out', 'interior', 'decorator', 'Sam', 'fakes', 'impotence', 'get', 'know', 'aloof', 'Lilith', 'Sternin', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', '22', 'episodes', 'offer', 'similar', 'terrific', 'humor', 'will', 'have', 'audience', 'laughing', 'hard', 'However', 'seventh', 'season', 'signs', 'minute', 'exhaustion', 'not', 'reach', 'same', 'level', 'entertaining', 'quality', 'previous', 'season.Cheers', 'Complete', 'Seventh', 'Season', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'relief', 'audience', 'especially', 'viewer', 'little', 'tired', 'drained', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'be', 'expected', 'seventh', 'season', 'suffer', 'little', 'performance', 'fatigue', 'might', 'be', 'consequence', 'having', 'had', 'show', 'air', 'seven', 'years', 'might', 'have', 'caused', 'audience', 'become', 'too', 'familiar', 'characters', 'Thus', 'may', 'make', 'many', 'comic', 'experiences', 'feel', 'little', 'repetitive', 'Nonetheless', 'seventh', 'season', 'very', 'good', 'sitcom', 'experience', 'must', 'see', 'Cheers', 'fans', 'who', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'well-written', 'humor']",Cheers: Season 7

936043,A1POCLWCPYSTGT,B000B5XOTS,Michael P. Beck,"[7, 10]","I won't comment on the contents of this season, or on the show in general. Cheers was one of the greatest shows ever and this season was one of the highlights of the series' run. What I will comment on is the horrendous picture quality evident in two of the episodes that I watched from the first two discs- 'One Happy Chappy in a Snappy Serape' and 'Bar Wars II: The Woodman Strikes Back'. There may be more examples of poor picture quality throughout the rest of this set, but I've only managed to watch a few episodes so far.In several instances, when the camera angle cuts from one vantage point to another, it appears as if we move from a completely pristine image quality to one that was taken from a 20 year old VHS dubbed copy (of a copy, of a copy). During these scenes, the picture quality is nothing less than pathetic. I'm not knit picking over a slight decrease in quality here. It's so bad that you wonder what kind of engineer could watch this and permit it to be released as a final product. Absurdly darks hues, fuzziness, graininess, etc plague these particular scenes, after which the episode jumps back to another camera angle to show an absolute pristine image. This almost makes it worse than if they were to show the entire episode using the poor quality footage, because it's so inconsistent. You get the idea that you are watching a show from the early 1970s spliced together with something currently on TV. Through the entire sequence however, the audio remains unchanged.The most angering part of this situation is that I've seen these episodes on TV in syndication countless times and this image quality issue was never present in those airings. So why is this now a problem? It just doesn't make sense that the DVD presentation should be so much worse than the syndicated version on television. After all, we are paying to see it on DVD. I'm surprised that the other reviewers did not make more of a stink about this. Again, I'm not knit picking over some minor picture flaws. The picture quality is nothing short of offensive.

A great moment in this season of a great sitcom.",5,Kelley's hair is so clean!,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,400,"['came', 'Amazon', 'tonight', 'specific', 'purpose', 'contributing', 'Cheers', 'review', 'saluting', 'Kelley', 'Song', 'delight', 'Gerry', 'V', 'already', 'mentioned', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Cheers', 'moment', 'One', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'laugh', 'tear', 'up', 'Woody', 'started', 'out', 'love', 'song', 'Kelley', 'then', 'came', 'line', 'hair', 'so', 'clean', 'ROFL', 'A', 'great', 'moment', 'season', 'great', 'sitcom']",Cheers: Season 7

I had no intention of buying all eleven season but wanted the first five, until Shelly Long left the show. After watching the first five seasons, I bought seasons six, seven, and eighht. Very enjoyable although I never thought the character of Robin Colcord was necessary or very funny. I also thought that sometimes Kirstie Alley went over the top with her Rebecca character, like she watched too much I love Lucy and was imitating Lucille Ball sometimes. All she ever needed to do was play the part and say the lines, and she would have been very good and funny. All in all this is one of the best shows ever done with one of the best casts ever assembled. I bought seasons nine, ten, and eleven and was sad all over again when I saw the last show. Now I can watch it as many times as I want however. There are no out takes in most of these discs just the first season.",5,Cheers for Cheers,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,926,"['eleven', 'seasons', 'classic', 'show', 'are', 'fantastic', 'had', 'intention', 'buying', 'eleven', 'season', 'wanted', 'first', 'five', 'Shelly', 'Long', 'left', 'show', 'watching', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'bought', 'seasons', 'six', 'seven', 'eighht', 'Very', 'enjoyable', 'never', 'thought', 'character', 'Robin', 'Colcord', 'was', 'necessary', 'very', 'funny', 'also', 'thought', 'sometimes', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'went', 'top', 'Rebecca', 'character', 'watched', 'too', 'much', 'love', 'Lucy', 'was', 'imitating', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'sometimes', 'ever', 'needed', 'do', 'was', 'play', 'part', 'say', 'lines', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'funny', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'done', 'one', 'best', 'casts', 'ever', 'assembled', 'bought', 'seasons', 'nine', 'ten', 'eleven', 'was', 'sad', 'over', 'again', 'when', 'saw', 'last', 'show', 'Now', 'can', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'want', 'however', 'are', 'out', 'most', 'discs', 'just', 'first', 'season']",Cheers: Season 7

This season is still funny, but not rip roaring funny like seasons 1-5. Sam, now just an employee, is still trying to buy the bar back. Kirstie Alley never impressed me in any role, much less this one. We also get away from the bar scenes and into other locations. I honestly think Woody should have been given a bigger role, but everything seems to center on Sam and Rebecca (Kirstie's character). I stil enjoy watching at this point, but the best jokes are behind us.",4,"Still like the show, but it has peaked",1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,584,"['show', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'time', 'However', 'shows', 'decline', 'so', 'many', 'seasons', 'season', 'still', 'funny', 'not', 'rip', 'roaring', 'funny', 'seasons', '1-5', 'Sam', 'now', 'just', 'employee', 'still', 'trying', 'buy', 'bar', 'back', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'never', 'impressed', 'role', 'much', 'less', 'one', 'also', 'get', 'away', 'bar', 'scenes', 'other', 'locations', 'honestly', 'think', 'Woody', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'bigger', 'role', 'everything', 'center', 'Sam', 'Rebecca', 'Kirstie', 'character', 'stil', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'point', 'best', 'jokes', 'are']",Cheers: Season 7
