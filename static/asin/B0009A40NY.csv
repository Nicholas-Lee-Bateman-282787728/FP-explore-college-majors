So I have seen Madea's Witness Protection, Madea Goes to Jail and now this play and Diary of a Mad Black Woman( play). I love the character of Madea which just lets it all out verbally, without holding back. Very funny to watch. I am not into musicals, but find that by the middle of the first play I watched, this seemed normal. I even liked the singing, much of which is God oriented. This play has some touching moments too. Mr. Tyler Perry was abused earlier in life and had been homeless, yet his message is one of hope, love and forgiveness. This guy has avoided the pitfalls of Hollywood too.

I loved the storyline and all of its subplots, I liked how the play incorporated flashbacks during some songs, I liked how crazy and insane the bellhop/bartender character was, I liked the parts where Madea started singing songs of different artists (esp. Whitney Houston and Missy Elliott) and I liked the nacho joke. That's just grazing the surface of what I liked about the play. Overall, I thought it was very entertaining and I give Tyler Perry one thumb up. The only thing that's holding me back from giving two thumbs up is that I was kinda let down that there wasn't enough Madea in the play. She didn't even show up until the second act and plus the whole concept of her, Mr. Brown and their two other classmates that aren't either dead or in retirement homes coming together for a class reunion kinda got lost in all of the other subplots going on. I mean we got a man who's cheating on his wife with another woman, a woman who's scared to stand up to her boyfriend who's physically abusing her and a married couple who's future together seems hopeless due the wife cheating on her husband.
