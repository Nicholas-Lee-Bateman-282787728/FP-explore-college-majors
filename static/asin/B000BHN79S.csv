Watching the film, there's a sense that there will be some big revelation, something in the script that will make the movie tie together, but that something never appears. In fact, the ending is even more ambiguous than the rest of the film. This movie is nothing but an exercise to show Alicia Silverstone in different stages of undress, and even those scenes aren't very revealing. The entire movie winds up being one bad mind game, or maybe a good one (depending on how you look at it; after all, the game is to get you to watch the movie). The scenery and photography are pretty good but do not make the film redeemable by any means.",1,"a beautiful set, but what's the point if the story is nonexistant?",1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,752,"['pointless', 'film', 'trying', 'be', 'mysterious', 'mystical', 'possible', 'up', 'being', 'nothing', 'boring', 'Watching', 'film', 'sense', 'will', 'be', 'big', 'revelation', 'something', 'script', 'will', 'make', 'movie', 'tie', 'together', 'something', 'never', 'fact', 'ending', 'even', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'rest', 'film', 'movie', 'nothing', 'exercise', 'show', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'different', 'stages', 'undress', 'even', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'revealing', 'entire', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'bad', 'mind', 'game', 'maybe', 'good', 'one', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'game', 'get', 'watch', 'movie', 'scenery', 'photography', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'film', 'redeemable', 'means']",Silence Becomes You

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","There's more than a few reviews out there that rip this film to pieces, but I can't bring myself to join in with that crowd.Silence Becomes You has its flaws.  I won't deny that.  It's a movie that sort of feels fake most of the time, like you're watching a play take place, but I might be confusing that with a really good visual presentation.  The voice acting and the way the women presented themselves certainly *felt* like I was watching a play.Anyway, the storyline is about two women who take in a drifter to their HUGE mansion located in the middle of a field (who happens to be a young man around the same age as the women).He quickly becomes interested in one of the girls much more than the other one, which leads the other young girl to become quite upset and jealous by this.  Throughout the film you can sense an increase in jealousy from the girl as she repeatedly stands by and watches make out scenes, and eventually reaches a boiling point... except when that time came, she didn't come across as particularly violent.  She just came across as weird, because the movie producers made one weird movie with this one.The film liked to jump around between all sorts of weird camera angles that dealt with the girls past, and how they were treated by their father.  It was rather odd though, and more confusing than anything else.Still, it wasn't a bad movie.  It was just very different.  I'm glad I watched it at least.",3,"hmmm, different",1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,1434,"['more', 'few', 'reviews', 'there', 'rip', 'film', 'pieces', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'join', 'crowd.Silence', 'Becomes', 'flaws', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'movie', 'sort', 'feels', 'fake', 'most', 'time', ""'re"", 'watching', 'play', 'take', 'place', 'might', 'be', 'confusing', 'really', 'good', 'visual', 'presentation', 'voice', 'acting', 'way', 'women', 'presented', 'certainly', '*felt*', 'was', 'watching', 'play.Anyway', 'storyline', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'take', 'drifter', 'HUGE', 'mansion', 'located', 'middle', 'field', 'who', 'be', 'young', 'man', 'same', 'age', 'women', '.He', 'quickly', 'becomes', 'interested', 'one', 'girls', 'much', 'more', 'other', 'one', 'other', 'young', 'girl', 'become', 'quite', 'upset', 'jealous', 'film', 'can', 'sense', 'increase', 'jealousy', 'girl', 'repeatedly', 'watches', 'make', 'out', 'scenes', 'eventually', 'boiling', 'point', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'particularly', 'violent', 'just', 'came', 'weird', 'movie', 'producers', 'made', 'one', 'weird', 'movie', 'one.The', 'film', 'liked', 'jump', 'around', 'sorts', 'weird', 'camera', 'dealt', 'girls', 'how', 'were', 'treated', 'father', 'was', 'rather', 'odd', 'more', 'confusing', 'anything', 'else.Still', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'different', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'least']",Silence Becomes You

942120,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000BHN79S,Only-A-Child,"[1, 1]","I caught the last 30 minutes of ""Silence Becomes You"" on cable and was intrigued enough to order the DVD. The DVD would have benefited from a director's commentary as the film is annoyingly vague at times (even to me) and I imagine that most viewers would welcome some clarification.My favorable first impression was probably a combination of the great production design, the excellent acting for the camera direction, and the understated yet inventive editing. It was filmed in Lithuania in HD video (said to be the first feature film with 100% digital cinematography), a technique that allowed the production staff to see each days rushes immediately so they could make timely rewrite and re-shoot decisions.""Silence Becomes You"" was written and directed by Stephanie Sinclaire, the Associate Artistic Director of the internationally known Kings Head Theatre in London. Her stage background shines through the production as all three of her main characters are given a nice multi-dimensionality. They are all flawed yet to varying degrees sympathetic.Take the assorted plot summaries and comments about this film with a certain grain of salt. It is about two 20-something half-sisters (if you credit certain statements and make an inference) who are still living together in the estate where they grew up. Alicia Silverstone plays Violet and Sienna Guillory plays Grace.They have decided that Violet should have a baby and lure a roguish drifter named Luke (Joe Anderson) to the estate for the purpose of getting her pregnant. There is a fourth character, the house, which exercises a considerable hold and influence over the two women. This relationship is represented by frequent memory flashbacks to their father and their childhood. The two young actresses who play them as little girls (most likely chosen for their physical similarity to Silverstone and Guillory) are convincingly directed by Sinclaire and their frequent appearances give the film a lyrical quality.As in Terrance Mallick's ""Days of Heaven"" (1978), the four principal characters represent the four elements; earth (the house), water (Violet), fire (Grace), and wind (Luke). The principal dynamic being how the least transitory element holds the three elusive elements in place. Most of the complaints about the film seem to center on Sinclaire's frequent misdirection, the viewer only knows what she wants you to know and when she wants you to know it. There does seem to be vagueness for the sake of vagueness, or at least in the service of introducing complexity to a relatively simple story. The girls have a degree of paranormal skills and there is a strong mental connection between them; qualities that their alchemist father (lead into gold is his metaphor for reproduction) went to great trouble to develop. Sinclaire violates the language of film with this and with her inconsistent flashback techniques; confusing the viewer about what is real, what is mystical, what is a dream, and what is simply a memory. So the film is unable to decide between being a ghost story of a psychological melodrama. Yet in the end all this stuff fits into the final explanation so as long as you get it there is little cause for complaint.This is a must see for Silverstone fans, by far the best thing she has ever done. Helped by an excellent acting for the camera director and a quality ensemble she is quite impressive. To me her face has always seemed slightly off-balance, making her an excellent fit playing a character that is somewhat off-kilter.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",4,"A ""Must-See"" for Silverstone Fans",1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,3567,"['caught', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'Silence', 'Becomes', 'cable', 'was', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'order', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'director', 'commentary', 'film', 'annoyingly', 'vague', 'times', 'even', 'imagine', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'welcome', 'clarification.My', 'favorable', 'first', 'impression', 'was', 'probably', 'combination', 'great', 'production', 'design', 'excellent', 'acting', 'camera', 'direction', 'understated', 'yet', 'inventive', 'editing', 'was', 'filmed', 'Lithuania', 'HD', 'video', 'said', 'be', 'first', 'feature', 'film', '100', '%', 'digital', 'cinematography', 'technique', 'allowed', 'production', 'staff', 'see', 'days', 'rushes', 'immediately', 'could', 'make', 'timely', 'rewrite', 're-shoot', 'decisions', 'Silence', 'Becomes', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Stephanie', 'Sinclaire', 'Associate', 'Artistic', 'Director', 'internationally', 'known', 'Kings', 'Head', 'Theatre', 'London', 'stage', 'background', 'production', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'nice', 'multi-dimensionality', 'are', 'flawed', 'yet', 'varying', 'degrees', 'sympathetic.Take', 'assorted', 'plot', 'summaries', 'comments', 'film', 'certain', 'grain', 'salt', 'two', '20-something', 'half-sisters', 'credit', 'certain', 'statements', 'make', 'inference', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'together', 'estate', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'Violet', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'Grace.They', 'have', 'decided', 'Violet', 'should', 'have', 'baby', 'lure', 'roguish', 'drifter', 'named', 'Luke', 'Joe', 'Anderson', 'estate', 'purpose', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'fourth', 'character', 'house', 'considerable', 'hold', 'influence', 'two', 'women', 'relationship', 'represented', 'frequent', 'memory', 'flashbacks', 'father', 'childhood', 'two', 'young', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'little', 'girls', 'most', 'likely', 'chosen', 'physical', 'similarity', 'Silverstone', 'Guillory', 'are', 'convincingly', 'directed', 'Sinclaire', 'frequent', 'appearances', 'give', 'film', 'lyrical', 'quality.As', 'Terrance', 'Mallick', 'Days', 'Heaven', '1978', 'four', 'principal', 'characters', 'represent', 'four', 'elements', 'earth', 'house', 'water', 'Violet', 'fire', 'Grace', 'wind', 'Luke', 'principal', 'dynamic', 'being', 'how', 'least', 'transitory', 'element', 'three', 'elusive', 'elements', 'place', 'Most', 'complaints', 'film', 'seem', 'center', 'Sinclaire', 'frequent', 'misdirection', 'viewer', 'only', 'what', 'know', 'when', 'know', 'seem', 'be', 'vagueness', 'sake', 'vagueness', 'least', 'service', 'introducing', 'complexity', 'relatively', 'simple', 'story', 'girls', 'have', 'degree', 'paranormal', 'skills', 'strong', 'mental', 'connection', 'qualities', 'alchemist', 'father', 'lead', 'gold', 'metaphor', 'reproduction', 'went', 'great', 'trouble', 'develop', 'Sinclaire', 'language', 'film', 'inconsistent', 'flashback', 'techniques', 'confusing', 'viewer', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'mystical', 'what', 'dream', 'what', 'simply', 'memory', 'film', 'unable', 'decide', 'being', 'ghost', 'story', 'psychological', 'melodrama', 'end', 'stuff', 'final', 'explanation', 'so', 'as', 'long', 'get', 'little', 'cause', 'complaint.This', 'must', 'see', 'Silverstone', 'fans', 'far', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'done', 'Helped', 'excellent', 'acting', 'camera', 'director', 'quality', 'ensemble', 'quite', 'impressive', 'face', 'always', 'seemed', 'slightly', 'off-balance', 'making', 'excellent', 'fit', 'playing', 'character', 'somewhat', 'off-kilter.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",Silence Becomes You

Two sisters bring home a man on a dare. A game of chance spirals into higher and higher stakes and finally out of control. Alicia Silverstone's character Violet is child-like, emotionally reactive, charming, seductive and free-spirited. Sienna Guillory's Grace is cool, erotic, manipulative, brilliant and increasingly unhinged. Joe Anderson's Luke is the good looking drifter, funny, irreverent, angry and vulnerable who reveals a strong inner compass that leads us to an explosive and finally poignant ending. Like a sailor dragged to the shore by mermaids Luke is picked up and brought to the strange, colorful, dysfunctional paradise of the two sisters who's closeness is often telepathic. He can't believe his luck, at first. Gradually the house reveals the secrets of the past which haunt the present and as Luke gets drawn further and further into the web the fragile balance becomes increasingly disturbed. The sisters, hot-housed by their father, brilliantly played by Leigh Lawson, have been raised as experiments and ruthlessly surveyed. Their freedom is in theory as they live in the golden cage of their own psyche. Grace follows in her father's foot steps whereas Violet longs to escape into a 'normal life'. Luke is forced to feel with devastating but ultimately cathartic consequences. With a nod to the classic suspense movies of the 40's it is a good ride, engaging, suspenseful and ultimately satisfying.P.S.

942122,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B000BHN79S,Thomas M. Sipos,"[21, 27]","I wanted to like this film.  I was rooting for it.  I love artsy sepia-toned horror films like LOST SOULS and THE RING and GOTHIKA -- but SILENCE BECOMES YOU is none of that.It's not a horror film.  It's hard to say what it is.  I kept waiting for something to gel; a story, a theme, a point ... something!  But NOTHING!The events (it's hard to call this a story) concern two young women living alone in a mansion.  Their father was an alchemist.  They allude to a ""plan,"" which seems to involve finding a young man to mate with so they can have a baby.Well, one of the sisters picks up a drifter in a bar and takes him home.  Then ... nothing much.  Lots of talk and flashbacks and superimposed images.  I mean LOTS of superimposed images, all throughout the film, but to no clear purpose.We see images of the young women as children, superimposed all over the place.  At one point, the man is asleep, then he's woken by one of the women as a child.  But it means nothing.  Is it a dream?  A flashback?  An imagining?  Alchemical magic?  Does it occur in the future?  The past?  Another dimension?""Who is beside you?"" the man asks without moving his lips.""No one is beside me,"" the child answers.""You're just a child,"" the man says.""I am eternally a child,"" the child replies.Uhm, okay.These images (of the women, their parents, the young man) are constantly superimposed, with sounds too.  LOTS of magical-poetic gibberish, with no clear rhyme or reason.The film seems to borrow a bit from D.H. Lawrence's THE FOX in that these two women become jealous over the man.All in all, a confusing mish-mash.  Beautiful sets, photography, sepia colors, but so BORING as it's all for naught.  Just gibberish, and superimposed images, and wandering in the snow, and just sheer nothing.Yes, there's an ending.  Or rather, the film ends.  Don't ask me to explain it.  There's a fire.  Or was there?  It seemed a big fire, but then the house seems unaffected.  The man seems to have died, but later we see him superimposed beside one of the women.  One seems to have lost her baby in childbirth (or did she?) while the other woman is pregnant.  Was it all a dream?  A magical alter-reality?  Who knows!I'm sure some people will be bowled over with stupefied admiration, but I like a story to go with all that pretty photography.An artsy-fartsy, none-horror, sorta Jane Austin type Gothic suspense thriller (the women watch an Austin movie on TV), but really, WHAT IS IT?",1,Beautifully shot film is a boring dud,1140652800,"02 23, 2006",2006,2459,"['wanted', 'like', 'film', 'was', 'rooting', 'love', 'artsy', 'sepia-toned', 'horror', 'films', 'LOST', 'SOULS', 'THE', 'RING', 'GOTHIKA', 'SILENCE', 'BECOMES', 'YOU', 'none', 'that.It', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'gel', 'story', 'theme', 'point', 'something', 'NOTHING', 'events', 'hard', 'call', 'story', 'concern', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'living', 'alone', 'mansion', 'father', 'was', 'alchemist', 'allude', 'plan', 'involve', 'finding', 'young', 'man', 'mate', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'baby.Well', 'one', 'sisters', 'up', 'drifter', 'bar', 'home', 'Then', 'nothing', 'much', 'Lots', 'talk', 'flashbacks', 'superimposed', 'images', 'mean', 'LOTS', 'superimposed', 'images', 'film', 'clear', 'purpose.We', 'see', 'images', 'young', 'women', 'children', 'superimposed', 'place', 'one', 'point', 'man', 'asleep', 'then', 'woken', 'one', 'women', 'child', 'nothing', 'dream', 'flashback', 'imagining', 'Alchemical', 'magic', 'occur', 'future', 'past', 'dimension', 'Who', 'man', 'moving', 'lips', 'one', 'child', 'answers', ""'re"", 'just', 'child', 'man', 'am', 'eternally', 'child', 'child', 'replies.Uhm', 'okay.These', 'images', 'women', 'parents', 'young', 'man', 'are', 'constantly', 'superimposed', 'sounds', 'too', 'LOTS', 'magical-poetic', 'gibberish', 'clear', 'rhyme', 'reason.The', 'film', 'borrow', 'bit', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', 'THE', 'FOX', 'two', 'women', 'become', 'jealous', 'man.All', 'confusing', 'mish-mash', 'Beautiful', 'sets', 'photography', 'sepia', 'colors', 'so', 'BORING', 'naught', 'Just', 'gibberish', 'superimposed', 'images', 'wandering', 'snow', 'just', 'sheer', 'nothing.Yes', 'ending', 'rather', 'film', 'ends', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'explain', 'fire', 'was', 'there', 'seemed', 'big', 'fire', 'then', 'house', 'unaffected', 'man', 'have', 'died', 'later', 'see', 'superimposed', 'beside', 'one', 'women', 'One', 'have', 'lost', 'baby', 'childbirth', 'did', 'other', 'woman', 'pregnant', 'Was', 'dream', 'magical', 'alter-reality', 'Who', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'bowled', 'stupefied', 'admiration', 'like', 'story', 'go', 'pretty', 'artsy-fartsy', 'none-horror', 'sorta', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'type', 'Gothic', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'women', 'watch', 'Austin', 'movie', 'TV', 'really', 'WHAT', 'IT']",Silence Becomes You
