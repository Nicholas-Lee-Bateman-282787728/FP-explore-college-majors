1235660,A1TRRIAA44W5OO,B001T6OPB4,Accen28,"[1, 1]","I saw this film for free, fortunately, which may have influenced my decision to give it two stars. If I had paid good money for it I wouldn't have felt so generous. I wanted to like it, but the crazy quilt storyline made it impossible. You know you have a problem when you stop the movie and back it up to see where you missed any foreshadowing whatsoever for certain dialog (I did this twice). Like another reviewer here, I was surprised when the main character (Sydney) first reveals how she feels toward her neighbor (Jane). I said (out loud, actually), ""Wait a minute. Where did that come from?"" I don't know if it was bad writing or bad editing or both, but after backing the movie up and looking for some inkling, I can safely say it came completely out of left field. This was not the lone example of dialog or plot that made no sense in the context of the film. There was far too much of it, so much I couldn't take the relationship seriously, which detracted quite a bit from the intended emotional effect of the ending (which also made no sense).The actors seemed to try their best, but all of them overacted, with the exception of Rachel Owens (Jane). She played free spirit, bohemian Jane without all the angst and bizarre emotional outbursts that characterized the rest of the characters. The children were there as props more than anything else. They didn't really react much to what was being said and done, and certainly not as real children would have reacted under the circumstances. I have to chalk up the over the top style of acting to bad direction, since they all seemed to do it.I found myself feeling bad for poor Corey, Sydney's husband. He suffers from a distinct lack of a sense of humor, but otherwise he seems like a man trying to provide for his family, while his wife nags him constantly about not spending enough time with her. And what was up with that? She wants him to spend more time with her, but when he's with her, she doesn't want him to touch her, and seems bored to tears with him. If I was Kathleen Benner (Rachel) I would get the impression my character was bipolar, not stricken with cancer.Speaking of the diagnosis, the doctor was almost comically cold and insensitive in revealing the details of her condition to Sydney, as soon as he found out she didn't have any insurance. When she told him, I'm literally going, ""Wait a minute. Isn't Corey a retired Marine? I mean, they made a point of showing us his bumper sticker. (I pay attention to those kind of details, but the writer, director, and producer apparently did not. Hint to them: do a search for military health benefits next time.) Why not take Sydney to a VA hospital? They have one conveniently located in Prescott, AZ. You'd think the doctor would know that, and would also question why Corey has no health benefits, like I did. I stopped taking the script very seriously at that point.Toss in your stereotypical token butch (the writer attempts to make her less stereotypical by making her a stereotypical born again right-wing Christian), a stereotypical evangelical preacher, and several odd plot points that made no sense (like the scene where a ""good samaritan"" stops and saves Sydney's life with mouth to mouth resuscitation in the pouring rain, and then conveniently and inexplicably disappears, only to reappear later to confuse the viewer).There was a decent movie hidden in this mess, and some actors who I think could have pulled it off. The problem is, it was too well hidden behind mediocre to bad dialog, bad direction, sloppy editing, and extraneous characters and plot twists. Not worth the two hours.",2,Promising Idea Ruined by Lack of Editing and Sloppy Plot (SPOILERS),1318636800,"10 15, 2011",2011,3628,"['saw', 'film', 'free', 'fortunately', 'may', 'have', 'influenced', 'decision', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'had', 'paid', 'good', 'money', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'felt', 'so', 'generous', 'wanted', 'like', 'crazy', 'quilt', 'storyline', 'made', 'impossible', 'know', 'have', 'problem', 'when', 'stop', 'movie', 'back', 'see', 'where', 'missed', 'foreshadowing', 'whatsoever', 'certain', 'dialog', 'did', 'twice', 'reviewer', 'here', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'Sydney', 'first', 'how', 'neighbor', 'Jane', 'said', 'loud', 'actually', 'Wait', 'minute', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'bad', 'writing', 'bad', 'editing', 'backing', 'movie', 'up', 'looking', 'inkling', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'came', 'completely', 'left', 'field', 'was', 'not', 'lone', 'example', 'dialog', 'plot', 'made', 'sense', 'context', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'much', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'relationship', 'seriously', 'detracted', 'quite', 'bit', 'intended', 'emotional', 'effect', 'ending', 'also', 'made', 'sense', '.The', 'actors', 'seemed', 'try', 'best', 'overacted', 'exception', 'Rachel', 'Owens', 'Jane', 'played', 'free', 'spirit', 'bohemian', 'Jane', 'angst', 'bizarre', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'characterized', 'rest', 'characters', 'children', 'were', 'there', 'props', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'react', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'done', 'certainly', 'not', 'real', 'children', 'would', 'have', 'reacted', 'circumstances', 'have', 'chalk', 'up', 'top', 'style', 'acting', 'bad', 'direction', 'seemed', 'do', 'it.I', 'found', 'feeling', 'bad', 'poor', 'Corey', 'Sydney', 'husband', 'distinct', 'lack', 'sense', 'humor', 'otherwise', 'man', 'trying', 'provide', 'family', 'wife', 'constantly', 'not', 'spending', 'enough', 'time', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'when', ""n't"", 'want', 'touch', 'bored', 'tears', 'was', 'Kathleen', 'Benner', 'Rachel', 'would', 'get', 'impression', 'character', 'was', 'bipolar', 'not', 'stricken', 'cancer.Speaking', 'diagnosis', 'doctor', 'was', 'almost', 'comically', 'cold', 'insensitive', 'revealing', 'details', 'condition', 'Sydney', 'as', 'soon', 'found', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'insurance', 'When', 'told', ""'m"", 'literally', 'going', 'Wait', 'minute', ""n't"", 'Corey', 'retired', 'Marine', 'mean', 'made', 'point', 'showing', 'bumper', 'sticker', 'pay', 'attention', 'kind', 'details', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'Hint', 'do', 'search', 'military', 'health', 'benefits', 'next', 'time', 'Why', 'not', 'take', 'Sydney', 'VA', 'hospital', 'have', 'one', 'conveniently', 'located', 'Prescott', 'AZ', ""'d"", 'think', 'doctor', 'would', 'know', 'would', 'also', 'question', 'why', 'Corey', 'health', 'benefits', 'did', 'stopped', 'taking', 'script', 'very', 'seriously', 'point.Toss', 'stereotypical', 'token', 'butch', 'writer', 'make', 'less', 'stereotypical', 'making', 'stereotypical', 'born', 'again', 'right-wing', 'Christian', 'stereotypical', 'evangelical', 'preacher', 'several', 'odd', 'plot', 'points', 'made', 'sense', 'scene', 'where', 'good', 'samaritan', 'stops', 'Sydney', 'life', 'mouth', 'mouth', 'resuscitation', 'pouring', 'rain', 'then', 'conveniently', 'inexplicably', 'disappears', 'only', 'reappear', 'later', 'confuse', 'viewer', '.There', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'hidden', 'mess', 'actors', 'who', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'problem', 'was', 'too', 'well', 'hidden', 'mediocre', 'bad', 'dialog', 'bad', 'direction', 'sloppy', 'editing', 'extraneous', 'characters', 'plot', 'twists', 'Not', 'two', 'hours']",Running on Empty Dreams

When I finished watching (and only out of curiosity) the DVD went straight to the garbage.The two lead actresses have potential. There are a couple of scenes when there relationship seems genuine, but the script is badly written, with much to-do-about-nothing dialogue and unclear ""conclusions"". The husband seems more like a porn actor than an ex-marine and the evangelical christian seems like a character out of a looney toons episode.There is no evolution of the feelings. Scenes come and go and there is never a sense of what is actually going thru the characters minds except when they say it. For example, when Sidney says "" I wanted to kiss you since the first time I saw you"". Really???? You could have fooled me with your non-chalant attitude. That's what acting is for... to reflect feelings not croak bad dialogue.The evangelical christian is an eye sore and the story so awfully told that at some point we were wondering if this was actually a born again christian film disguissed as lesbian themed.I am a supporter of the arts, but there is a line that should not be crossed.

1235665,AQ2UN38CMK119,B001T6OPB4,P. Mann,"[27, 30]","A film about a woman who leaves her traditional, heterosexual marriage to find love and happiness in the arms of another woman is not new.Lianna(1983) dealt with this topic as didDesert Hearts(1985). Of these three films, ""Running on Empty Dreams"" is the least. That is not, however, to say that it is entirely without merit. But there are significant flaws.""Running on Empty Dreams"" begins when Sydney Harris (Kathleen Benner) is diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Her doctor informs her that her condition is treatable, but Sydney and her husband, Corey (Jose Rosete), lack the money to pay for treatment. As Corey works longer hours, Sydney strikes up a friendship with single mother Jane (Rachel Owens), and the two share intimate (in the sense of personal, not necessarily sexual) thoughts, naturally drawing closer.There are multiple other elements to the film, including a lesbian-turned-evangelical-Christian who tries to prevent Sydney and Jane from forming a relationship, Sydney's efforts to sell a screenplay, Corey's rage, and, of course, the cancer itself. Too many elements pull the film in too many directions, and few of these elements receive satisfactorily in-depth treatment. Worse, they distract from the fundamental issue of Sydney's deteriorating relationship with her husband and son. Other flaws include the frequently too-loud background music, the at times over-the-top acting, and the script itself.There are some good aspects to the film. Sydney's and Jane's relationship seems genuine, for instance, and the two leads are generally good. Also, this is an independent film (made in three weeks, according to the film's Web site), so some leeway, especially on technical matters, is in order. (And, of course, it's hardly as if big-budget films are without errors. Think of all the errors inIndependence Day, for example, but that film seemed to do fairly well at the box office.) Still, though, I'd recommend ""Desert Hearts"" or ""Lianna"" for better treatment of similar themes. 2.5 stars.",3,There are better films on the same topic,1244419200,"06 8, 2009",2009,2012,"['film', 'woman', 'who', 'traditional', 'heterosexual', 'marriage', 'find', 'love', 'happiness', 'arms', 'woman', 'not', 'new.Lianna', '1983', 'dealt', 'topic', 'didDesert', 'Hearts', '1985', 'three', 'films', 'Running', 'Empty', 'Dreams', 'least', 'not', 'however', 'say', 'entirely', 'merit', 'are', 'significant', 'flaws', 'Running', 'Empty', 'Dreams', 'when', 'Sydney', 'Harris', 'Kathleen', 'Benner', 'diagnosed', 'thyroid', 'cancer', 'doctor', 'condition', 'treatable', 'Sydney', 'husband', 'Corey', 'Jose', 'Rosete', 'lack', 'money', 'pay', 'treatment', 'Corey', 'longer', 'hours', 'Sydney', 'up', 'friendship', 'single', 'mother', 'Jane', 'Rachel', 'Owens', 'two', 'share', 'intimate', 'sense', 'personal', 'not', 'necessarily', 'sexual', 'thoughts', 'naturally', 'drawing', 'closer.There', 'are', 'multiple', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'including', 'lesbian-turned-evangelical-Christian', 'who', 'prevent', 'Sydney', 'Jane', 'forming', 'relationship', 'Sydney', 'efforts', 'sell', 'screenplay', 'Corey', 'rage', 'course', 'cancer', 'Too', 'many', 'elements', 'pull', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'directions', 'few', 'elements', 'receive', 'satisfactorily', 'in-depth', 'treatment', 'Worse', 'distract', 'fundamental', 'issue', 'Sydney', 'deteriorating', 'relationship', 'husband', 'son', 'Other', 'flaws', 'include', 'frequently', 'too-loud', 'background', 'music', 'times', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'script', 'are', 'good', 'aspects', 'film', 'Sydney', 'Jane', 'relationship', 'genuine', 'instance', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'generally', 'good', 'Also', 'independent', 'film', 'made', 'three', 'weeks', 'according', 'film', 'Web', 'site', 'so', 'leeway', 'especially', 'technical', 'matters', 'order', 'course', 'hardly', 'big-budget', 'films', 'are', 'errors', 'Think', 'errors', 'inIndependence', 'Day', 'example', 'film', 'seemed', 'do', 'fairly', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'Still', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Desert', 'Hearts', 'Lianna', 'better', 'treatment', 'similar', 'themes', '2.5', 'stars']",Running on Empty Dreams
