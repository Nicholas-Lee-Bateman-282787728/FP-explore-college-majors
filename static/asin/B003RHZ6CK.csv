1360949,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B003RHZ6CK,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[4, 7]","I only saw one or two of these episodes during the 1970's, because I was busy going to college, but I remembered enjoying those I did see, so I got the series.  The Ellery Queen mysteries starred Jim Hutton--whose son Tim,Nero Wolfe: The Complete Classic Whodunit Series, andLeverage: The First Season, is now also an actor on TV--and David Wayne, and they make a great duo.  Their father-son interactions are entertaining and charming.The series was one of a number of similar format TV programs of different genre which created venues for the ""whatever-happened-to"" actors of preceding decades.  Shows like Love Boat,The Love Boat - Season One, Vol. 1, and Murder She Wrote,Murder, She Wrote - The Complete First Season, Columbo,Columbo - The Complete First Season, and others capitalized on the curiosity factor among audiences who enjoyed seeing old favorites back on stage.  Thus each episode of Ellery Queen features former film stars like Ray Milland, Dorothy Malone, Don Ameche, Rhonda Fleming, Howard Duff, Ida Lupino, and Eve Arden, and those of 50's and 60's TV series like Monte Markham, Anne Francis, Linda Day George, Larry Hagman and others.I found some of the characterizations rather wooden and 2-dimensional.  Since I know that most of the cast were veteran actors, I felt a little embarrassed for them at first, but after viewing several of the episodes it became apparent to me that they had been directed along this mode of expression; almost a caricature or cartoon presentation.  The whole seemed a parody of the 1930s film noir gangster pictures, which I'm sure, was intentional.  If it seemed unnatural to me without introspection, I suspect it will definitely seem so to younger viewers unfamiliar with that period in the history of cinema.  Just give it a chance.The series is rather dated, not by its fictional 1947 NYC venue but by its very 1970s style and presentation.  This is delightful for those of us who were young in the 70's as it lends a double dose of nostalgia, since many of us were born in the 40's, grew up in the 50's and 60's and went to college in the 60's and 70's.  Most of the older cast is recognizable because they were our parents' generation and the others were from our own.The series does a marvelous job of capturing the culture and technology of the 1940's.  The Queen household, especially the kitchen, is highly evocative of the period.  I still remember some of the appliances and kitchen gadgets shown from my own childhood.  The pressure cooker sequence was very familiar, since my parents were the proud owners of one when I was in grade school, and my mother managed to produce some pretty impressive results with it.  I do remember worrying that it might explode, just as it did for Ellery, but my mother managed to keep it under control. The old TVs are also familiar to me, and I'm sure there really were those who thought TV was just a ""fad"" at the time!  Seeing the ""future"" in the sequence on computer run trains was particularly enjoyable.  It made one feel positively clairvoyant!  The old candlestick phones and their successors the black desk phones also took me back, since my grandparents had first the one and then the other when I was quite little.The mysteries, some of them from original stories--though I don't recall any of them, despite having read most of them years ago--are mostly original works based on the Ellery Queen characters.  (""Ellery Queen"" is actually the pen name of a pair of authors, Dannay and Yaffe, who produced the original books.)  Most of the stories are very well plotted, with clues well placed and well hidden, so they are fair for the most part.  They don't rely on manipulation of character and plot at the end to make it come out right.  This was not always the case for some of the original books.  (I remember reading one in French and was upset by the abrupt changes made at the end to make it come out right, which reminded me that I'd already read the book in English years before and had felt the same way about it!) Some of the regular characters do a marvellous job of diverting the viewer's attention with their own ""brilliant deductions,"" showing that other answers are possible, just as is the case in some other mystery writer's creations.  The best example of this is Collin Dexter'sInspector Morse - Complete CollectionandThe First Inspector Morse Omnibus: The Dead of Jericho, Service of All the Dead, the Silent World of Nicholas Quinn.  As always, however, there is only one right answer and Ellery (and Morse) has it.Vintage 70s TV",4,Vintage 70s TV,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,4562,"['only', 'saw', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', '1970', 'was', 'busy', 'going', 'college', 'remembered', 'enjoying', 'did', 'see', 'got', 'series', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'mysteries', 'starred', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'son', 'Tim', 'Nero', 'Wolfe', 'Complete', 'Classic', 'Whodunit', 'Series', 'andLeverage', 'First', 'Season', 'now', 'also', 'actor', 'TV', 'David', 'Wayne', 'make', 'great', 'duo', 'father-son', 'interactions', 'are', 'entertaining', 'charming.The', 'series', 'was', 'one', 'number', 'similar', 'format', 'TV', 'programs', 'different', 'genre', 'created', 'venues', 'whatever-happened-to', 'actors', 'preceding', 'decades', 'Shows', 'Love', 'Boat', 'Love', 'Boat', 'Season', 'One', 'Vol', '1', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Columbo', 'Columbo', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'others', 'capitalized', 'curiosity', 'factor', 'audiences', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'old', 'favorites', 'back', 'stage', 'Thus', 'episode', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'former', 'film', 'stars', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'Dorothy', 'Malone', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'Rhonda', 'Fleming', 'Howard', 'Duff', 'Ida', 'Lupino', 'Eve', 'Arden', '50', '60', 'TV', 'series', 'Monte', 'Markham', 'Anne', 'Francis', 'Linda', 'Day', 'George', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'others.I', 'found', 'characterizations', 'rather', 'wooden', '2-dimensional', 'know', 'most', 'cast', 'were', 'veteran', 'actors', 'felt', 'little', 'embarrassed', 'first', 'viewing', 'several', 'episodes', 'became', 'apparent', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'mode', 'expression', 'almost', 'caricature', 'cartoon', 'presentation', 'whole', 'seemed', 'parody', '1930s', 'film', 'noir', 'gangster', 'pictures', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'intentional', 'seemed', 'unnatural', 'introspection', 'suspect', 'will', 'definitely', 'seem', 'so', 'younger', 'viewers', 'unfamiliar', 'period', 'history', 'cinema', 'Just', 'give', 'chance.The', 'series', 'rather', 'dated', 'not', 'fictional', '1947', 'NYC', 'venue', 'very', '1970s', 'style', 'presentation', 'delightful', 'who', 'were', 'young', '70', 'double', 'dose', 'nostalgia', 'many', 'were', 'born', '40', 'grew', 'up', '50', '60', 'went', 'college', '60', '70', 'Most', 'older', 'cast', 'recognizable', 'were', 'parents', 'generation', 'others', 'were', 'own.The', 'series', 'marvelous', 'job', 'capturing', 'culture', 'technology', '1940', 'Queen', 'household', 'especially', 'kitchen', 'highly', 'evocative', 'period', 'still', 'remember', 'appliances', 'kitchen', 'gadgets', 'shown', 'own', 'childhood', 'pressure', 'cooker', 'sequence', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', 'parents', 'were', 'proud', 'owners', 'one', 'when', 'was', 'grade', 'school', 'mother', 'managed', 'produce', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'results', 'do', 'remember', 'worrying', 'might', 'explode', 'just', 'did', 'Ellery', 'mother', 'managed', 'keep', 'control', 'old', 'TVs', 'are', 'also', 'familiar', ""'m"", 'sure', 'really', 'were', 'who', 'thought', 'TV', 'was', 'just', 'fad', 'time', 'Seeing', 'future', 'sequence', 'computer', 'run', 'trains', 'was', 'particularly', 'enjoyable', 'made', 'one', 'feel', 'positively', 'clairvoyant', 'old', 'candlestick', 'phones', 'successors', 'black', 'desk', 'phones', 'also', 'took', 'back', 'grandparents', 'had', 'first', 'one', 'then', 'other', 'when', 'was', 'quite', 'little.The', 'mysteries', 'original', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'having', 'read', 'most', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'mostly', 'original', 'works', 'based', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'characters', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'actually', 'pen', 'name', 'pair', 'authors', 'Dannay', 'Yaffe', 'who', 'produced', 'original', 'books', 'Most', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'plotted', 'clues', 'well', 'placed', 'well', 'hidden', 'are', 'fair', 'most', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'manipulation', 'character', 'plot', 'end', 'make', 'come', 'out', 'right', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'original', 'books', 'remember', 'reading', 'one', 'French', 'was', 'upset', 'abrupt', 'changes', 'made', 'end', 'make', 'come', 'out', 'right', 'reminded', ""'d"", 'already', 'read', 'book', 'English', 'years', 'before', 'had', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'regular', 'characters', 'do', 'marvellous', 'job', 'diverting', 'viewer', 'attention', 'own', 'brilliant', 'deductions', 'showing', 'other', 'answers', 'are', 'possible', 'just', 'case', 'other', 'mystery', 'writer', 'creations', 'best', 'example', 'Collin', ""Dexter'sInspector"", 'Morse', 'Complete', 'CollectionandThe', 'First', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'Omnibus', 'Dead', 'Jericho', 'Service', 'All', 'Dead', 'Silent', 'World', 'Nicholas', 'Quinn', 'always', 'however', 'only', 'one', 'right', 'answer', 'Ellery', 'Morse', 'it.Vintage', '70s', 'TV']",Ellery Queen Mysteries

Ellery Queen filled the quota for mystery.I never understood why the show failed to have a second season. Its production value and quality  is up there with the other mystery shows. Jim Hutton, thats Leverage's Tim Hutton's Father, is likeable as Ellery Queen. David Wayne is Inspector Richard Queen. Peter Fisher, Levinson and Link created this show like they did future hit Murder She Wrote for CBS. The actor preform well and make this show likeable. The guest Stars each week  were like Love Boat, a who's who of show business. The Mysteries were well thought out.In many ways I assume that this show was a thinking man's shows and most on Sunday Nights wanted either fluff or 60 Minutes..and this show was neither.Now on DVD, mysteries audiences can savor this stylist show with the cleanest master recorders.

1360957,A2FQ2M9ZIODFKV,B003RHZ6CK,Bradley Friedman,"[3, 3]","As a lifelong fan of Golden Age mystery writers, I count Ellery Queen as one of my favorite American authors, and I remember being thrilled when this show came out. Watching it again with a new perspective, I find it an interesting amalgamation of the ""old"" and ""new"" Ellery, yet it is a wholly original creation of the scriptwriters and actors who played these roles.The character of Ellery Queen went through a complete transformation during his reign as the cousins who created him, Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee, began to allow their own political, social and spiritual concerns to pervade their writing. The early Ellery was a rather obnoxious fop, along the lines of S.S. Van Dine's Philo Vance, and the mysteries he solved were pure puzzling delights! Each book was titled after a different nationality (The Dutch Shoe Mystery, the Egyptian Cross Mystery, and on and on, including my very favorite, The Greek Coffin Mystery). In terms of puzzle alone, the TV series draws more on these early cases for inspiration, with stylized settings and characters and odd clues, including Queen's specialty, the dying message clue. It was in these early books that Queen issued his ""Challenge to the Reader,"" and Jim Hutton's Queen continues that tradition in the series.Naturally, a 45 minute long television program cannot hope to create as complex a mystery as Queen's novels allow, so the characters tend to be thinly drawn and the clues minimal. I remember reading The French Powder Mystery, set in a NYC department store. During the denouement, which incorporated nearly one hundred pages, Ellery gathered the suspects together and sifted through what seemed like DOZENS of clues, accusing suspect after suspect until he narrowed in on the actual culprit. The TV mysteries are much more straightforward, and some are thinner than others, giving ample time (sometimes a little too ample) to the comical interactions between Ellery and his dad, or to the sneering misdirection of Simon Brimmer's theories. But the mysteries are great fun, for all the reasons that fans have stated: great guest stars, clever clues, and a willingness to include the audience in on the game.It's interesting that the show is set in the post-war 40's because by then the authors had transformed Ellery from a high-handed twit to a real human being, troubled by the world around him, spiritually bereft, lonely for companionship and connected to his father by much more complex threads. On the one hand, their father/son bond was deeply drawn, warm and rich. But more often than not, Ellery resented his entry into crime-solving, as the cases began to take a much more emotional toll on the detective, the suspects, and even the killer at times. These mysteries are better written, if less clue-centered. They still play fair with the audience; some of them have terrific twists. But now Dannay and Lee are dealing with some really hard-hitting issues: post-traumatic stress disorder on returning soldiers, the unhappy willingness of society to embrace fascism, the question of the existence of a deity! Sounds like fun, no? But some of these later books are true classics: Calamity Town, The Murderer is a Fox, Cat of Many Tails, Ten Days Wonder, and so on.None of the stuff of later works is present in the TV show, except for the warm filial bond of the Queens. It doesn't belong in this series, but I sure wish someone would consider dramatizing these later books. The one attempt at it, a TV movie based on Cat of Many Tails, was fairly mediocre due to the modernized setting and the miscasting of Peter Lawford as Ellery.

They were aptly dubbed the Rolls Royce of the industry.Needless to say, these guys know their stuff, and ELLERY QUEEN is up there with the great ones produced by this talented team. Jim Hutton gives his role a soft touch with his Einstein-like brain, touched off with an insatiable sense of humor, not to mention his good looks. The mood of the show is highlighted with a 1940s style faithfully represented with stylish wardrobe and extraordinary automobiles.David Wayne, who plays Ellery's father, is a classic character actor who gives the show balance, and a sense of humor all his own, offset with his obvious love and admiration for his son.The series is set with a plethora of fantastic guest actors, and good writing.

It was set in the late 1940s, and the killer was not revealed until the last few minutes of the show. I liked it because the show actually made you think and pay attention, always challenging you to guess the identity of the killer before Ellery Queen did. It was a very intriguing and interesting showThat is not surprising, considering that The Ellery Queen series was created by Richard Levinson and William Link, who also wrote for Columbo, Mannix, and Murder, She Wrote.The series began with a two-hour pilot that in March of 1975 was part of the NBC Sunday Mystery Movie, a revolving series of feature-length episodes of Columbo, McMillan & Wife, and McCloud. NBC then filmed 22 episodes and added it to their Fall schedule, but the show was cancelled due to low ratings. Which was a feat caused by the NBC network changing its days and viewing times around, and not because of any lack of quality or lagging interest in the series itself.I was quick to buy this set at Barnes and Nobel when it became available in November of 2010, for about $45.00, and it compliments, very well, my previous purchase of the Nero Wolf  series from Amazon in October of 2009.

1360978,A1EQ35NR4CZL6Y,B003RHZ6CK,Dmarkwind,"[0, 0]","Nine years before Angela Lansbury's Jessica Fletcher started her 12-year run as a true-crime solving mystery writer in Murder She Wrote, Jim Hutton set the formula as Ellery Queen.I fondly remember this show and its catchy theme music as a kid when its one season of 23 episodes ran in 1975 and 1976. It's nice to see the show finally on disc, but the 2010 DVD set includes no extras whatsoever. Set in New York in the late 1940's, Hutton's Ellery Queen is somewhat absent-minded, a successful mystery writer, and the son of a famous New York homicide detective played by David Wayne. Ellery is frequently called in ""unofficially"" to help solve crimes which baffle the police. Kinda makes one wonder how dad keeps his job and how Ellery gets any writing done. The chemistry between Hutton's Ellery and his on-screen dad is good, although their facial features aren't very similar and I have trouble believing the very tall Hutton is related to the very short Wayne. Wayne's age and his character's general veneer of gruffness remind me of Harry Morgan's Col. Harry Potter in M*A*S*H.Likeable Hutton, who I first  discovered in the John Wayne film, Hellfighters, spends a lot of time scratching his head and acting like he's thinking really hard. It's sad to think that Hutton died at age 45 of liver cancer just four years after this series ended. A hallmark of the show is that at the end of every episode, Ellery ""breaks the fourth wall"" and talks directly to the TV audience, basically saying, ""now you have all the clues, have you figured it out yet?"" Like Murder She Wrote, each episode ends with a gathering of all the suspects where Ellery explains what the pertinent clues mean and exposes the murderer.The show runs on a couple of recurring conceits - that murder victims almost always spend their dying breath trying to leave a cryptic clue as to the identity of their murderer, and once cornered, murderers always come clean and confess. To mix things up, Ellery has two would be crime-solving rivals who alternate in and out of the episodes. One is a smarmy crime show radio show host named Simon Brimmer, played by John Hillerman who went on to play Higgins in Magnum P.I. The other is a pithy reporter named Frank Flannigan played by Ken Swofford, who went on to play Mr. Morloch in the two-season TV version of Fame, as well as a slew of other television roles throughout the 70's, 80's , and early 90's. Ironically, both actors later played recurring roles in Murder She Wrote.A lot of the fun of this show is seeing all the past and future stars who show up - George Burns, Joan Collins, Vincent Price, Larry Hagman, Dean Stockwell, Rene Auberjonois, Ed Mc Mahon, Ray Walston, Dick Van Patton, Jim Backus, June Lockhart, Betty White, Roddy McDowell (as a guy from New Jersey with a German accent no less), and many others. Chances are, if you don't know who any of these people are, this probably isn't your show. There's not a lot of action in Ellery Queen and the series relies on some moody skyline shots to remind viewers this show is set in the 1940s. Unfortunately, they use the same shots over and over and if you're watching the series back to back on disk, you'll get tired of seeing the same video footage again and again, as well as the same exterior shots of the brownstone where Ellery and his dad live. Overall, an entertaining diversion, but probably too dated for younger viewers.",4,"You could call it ""Murder He Wrote""",1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,3413,"['Nine', 'years', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'started', '12-year', 'run', 'true-crime', 'solving', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'set', 'formula', 'Ellery', 'Queen.I', 'fondly', 'remember', 'show', 'catchy', 'theme', 'music', 'kid', 'when', 'one', 'season', '23', 'episodes', 'ran', '1975', '1976', 'nice', 'see', 'show', 'finally', 'disc', '2010', 'DVD', 'set', 'extras', 'whatsoever', 'Set', 'New', 'York', 'late', '1940', 'Hutton', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'somewhat', 'absent-minded', 'successful', 'mystery', 'writer', 'son', 'famous', 'New', 'York', 'homicide', 'detective', 'played', 'David', 'Wayne', 'Ellery', 'frequently', 'called', 'unofficially', 'help', 'solve', 'crimes', 'baffle', 'police', 'Kinda', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'dad', 'job', 'how', 'Ellery', 'writing', 'done', 'chemistry', 'Hutton', 'Ellery', 'on-screen', 'dad', 'good', 'facial', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'similar', 'have', 'trouble', 'believing', 'very', 'tall', 'Hutton', 'related', 'very', 'short', 'Wayne', 'Wayne', 'age', 'character', 'general', 'veneer', 'gruffness', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Col.', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'M*A*S*H.Likeable', 'Hutton', 'who', 'first', 'discovered', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film', 'Hellfighters', 'lot', 'time', 'scratching', 'head', 'acting', 'thinking', 'really', 'hard', 'sad', 'think', 'Hutton', 'died', 'age', '45', 'liver', 'cancer', 'just', 'four', 'years', 'series', 'ended', 'hallmark', 'show', 'end', 'episode', 'Ellery', 'fourth', 'wall', 'talks', 'directly', 'TV', 'audience', 'basically', 'saying', 'now', 'have', 'clues', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'yet', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'episode', 'gathering', 'suspects', 'where', 'Ellery', 'what', 'pertinent', 'clues', 'mean', 'murderer.The', 'show', 'couple', 'recurring', 'conceits', 'murder', 'victims', 'almost', 'always', 'spend', 'dying', 'breath', 'trying', 'leave', 'cryptic', 'clue', 'identity', 'murderer', 'once', 'cornered', 'murderers', 'always', 'come', 'clean', 'confess', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'Ellery', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'crime-solving', 'rivals', 'who', 'alternate', 'episodes', 'One', 'smarmy', 'crime', 'show', 'radio', 'show', 'host', 'named', 'Simon', 'Brimmer', 'played', 'John', 'Hillerman', 'who', 'went', 'play', 'Higgins', 'Magnum', 'P.I', 'other', 'pithy', 'reporter', 'named', 'Frank', 'Flannigan', 'played', 'Ken', 'Swofford', 'who', 'went', 'play', 'Mr.', 'Morloch', 'two-season', 'TV', 'version', 'Fame', 'as', 'well', 'slew', 'other', 'television', 'roles', '70', '80', 'early', '90', 'Ironically', 'actors', 'later', 'played', 'recurring', 'roles', 'Murder', 'Wrote.A', 'lot', 'fun', 'show', 'seeing', 'past', 'future', 'stars', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'George', 'Burns', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Rene', 'Auberjonois', 'Ed', 'Mc', 'Mahon', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Patton', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'June', 'Lockhart', 'Betty', 'White', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'guy', 'New', 'Jersey', 'German', 'accent', 'no', 'less', 'many', 'others', 'Chances', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'probably', ""n't"", 'show', 'not', 'lot', 'action', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'series', 'moody', 'skyline', 'shots', 'remind', 'viewers', 'show', 'set', '1940s', 'Unfortunately', 'use', 'same', 'shots', ""'re"", 'watching', 'series', 'back', 'back', 'disk', ""'ll"", 'get', 'tired', 'seeing', 'same', 'video', 'footage', 'again', 'again', 'as', 'well', 'same', 'exterior', 'shots', 'brownstone', 'where', 'Ellery', 'dad', 'live', 'Overall', 'entertaining', 'diversion', 'probably', 'too', 'dated', 'younger', 'viewers']",Ellery Queen Mysteries

1360982,A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO,B003RHZ6CK,E. Hornaday,"[389, 402]","The 1975 Cult-Classic TV whodunit Ellery Queen starring the brilliant Jim Hutton is finally being released on DVD in its entirety, thanks to E1 Entertainment.The series was based on the popular classic Ellery Queen mystery books from the 1930's. The show lasted only one season on NBC, but has remained a fan favorite.Set in the post-WWII 1947, the show closely followed the format of the Ellery Queen mystery novels, which carefully laid out the clues before the reader/audience and invited them to attempt to solve the mystery before Ellery Queen presented the solution.The show premiered March 23, 1975 with a telepilot, ""Too Many Suspects,"" which was adapted from the book, The Fourth Side of the Triangle. Beloved veteran character actor, David Wayne, portrayed Ellery's crusty but loveable father, Inspector Richard Queen throughout the series. Wayne perfectly delivered folksy dialog ostensibly from the 1940's like, ""Why don't we cut all the banana oil?""Hutton (the father of actor Timothy Hutton) played Ellery to perfection, blending absent-minded goofiness with genuine emotional depth and boyish charm. Together, he and Wayne had the perfect on-screen chemistry, creating an authentic charm that remains undiminished after all of these years.In all, 22 fun one-hour episodes followed beginning on Sept. 11, 1975, the last show airing on April 4, 1976.In the early Queen books, just prior to the presentation of the solution to the mystery, a ""Challenge To The Reader"" was issued during which the suspects and clues were reviewed and the reader challenged to guess the solution to the crime.This tradition was preserved in the series, when Hutton as Ellery turns from the scene to the camera and speaks directly to viewers. This occurs prior to the commercial break that led into the final act. Ellery provides a brief recap, then invites the audience to add up the clues, and to identify the guilty party.The final act always employed the time-honored detective clich&eacute; of calling all of the suspects together (it was made famous by Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, who often gathered the crowd in together in the drawing room) with Ellery presenting the solution to the group, frequently upstaging and skewering the solution proposed by whichever rival sleuth was also in the episode.Rounding out the cast was John Hillerman, who portrayed Radio Mystery Master, Simon Brimmer. Brimmer constantly tried to upstage the Inspector and also embarrass Ellery by solving the crime first -- and he always failed.In addition, Ken Swofford portrayed yellow journalist Frank Flannigan; Tom Reese, as the stalwart and stone-face Lt. Thomas Velie, the Inspector's right-hand man; and Nina Roman, who portrayed the Inspector's secretary, Grace, in seven episodes.The show as also known for its clever opening montage, in which an announcer relays that this so-and-so is about to be murdered. Who is guilty? Is it ...? Next, each suspect (guest star) is shown in a brief clip, speaking a short humorous phrase. It ends with, ""Match wits with Ellery Queen and see if you can guess whodunit!""The series was created by the writing/producing team of Richard Levinson and William Link, who also created the Classic TV mystery/police shows Mannix, Columbo and Murder, She Wrote.""Too Many Suspects,"" the pilot episode, IS included in this six-disc complete series boxed set entitiled: ""Ellery Queen Mysteries."" The other 22 episodes included are: The Adventure of Auld Lang Syne; The Adventure of the Lover's Leap; The Adventure of the Chinese Dog; The Adventure of the Comic Book Crusader; The Adventure of the 12th Floor Express; The Adventure of Miss Aggie's Farewell Performance; The Adventure of Colonel Niven's Memoirs; The Adventure of the Mad Tea Party; The Adventure of Veronica's Veils; The Adventure of the Pharaoh's Curse; The Adventure of the Blunt Instrument; The Adventure of the Black Falcon; The Adventure of the Sunday Punch; The Adventure of the Eccentric Engineer; The Adventure of the Wary Witness; The Adventure of the Judas Tree; The Adventure of the Sinister Scenario; The Adventure of the Two-Faced Woman; The Adventure of the Tyrant of Tin Pan Alley; The Adventure of Caesar's Last Sleep; The Adventure of the Hard-Hearted Huckster; and The Adventure of the Disappearing Dagger.In addition to these fabulous episodes, which have been completely remastered, E1 Entertainment has included a special collector's book in the set.Guest stars truly included the cream of 1970's acting talent on the small and big screens, including: Kim Hunter, Ray Milland, Tim O'Connor, Gail Strickland, Joan Collins, David Doyle, Ray Walston, Anne Francis, Don Ameche, Susan Strasberg, Orson Bean, Dee Wallace, Lynda Day George, Tom Bosley, Pat Harrington Jr., Eve Arden, Bert Parks, Betty White, Robbert Loggia, Rene Auberjonois, Pernell Roberts, Jim Backus, Larry Hagman, George Burns, Hayden Rorke, June Lockhart, John Larroquette, Eva Gabor, Dean Stockwell, Tab Hunter, Roddy McDowall, Susan Stafford, William Schallert, Robert Alda, Arthur Godfrey, Ed McMahon, Bobby Sherman, Dick Van Patten, Tricia O'Neil, Cesar Romero, Dick Sargent, Bill Dana, Diana Muldaur, Noah Beery Jr., Troy Donahue, Vincent Price, James Sikking, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Edward Mulhare, Vera Miles, Victor Buono, Polly Bergen, Ken Berry, Norman Fell, Edward Albert, Kevin Tighe, Bibi Besch, Bob Crane, Juliet Mills, Gary Burghoff, Ronny Cox, and Walter Pidgeon.(Important FYI: Here's a quick word about the ""real"" Ellery Queen in the literary world. ""Ellery Queen"" is actually the pseudonym used by two cousins, Frederick Dannay and Manfred B. Lee to write detective fiction. Some of the later Ellery Queen novels were ghost-written by Theodore Sturgeon, Jack Vance, and other prominent writers.In their successful series of novels, Ellery Queen is not only the name of the author, but also the detective-hero of the stories. The writing team also wrote four novels under the name of Barnaby Ross about a Shakespearian actor/detective named Drury Lane. These novels were later reiussed under the Ellery Queen byline.For a while in the 1930s ""Ellery Queen"" and ""Barnaby Ross"" staged a series of public debates in which one cousin impersonated Queen and the other impersonated Ross.The early Queen novels encouraged the reader to attempt to solve the puzzle, with an explicit note in the text when the reader had all the necessary information.There were many paperback novels written by ""Ellery Queen"" in the 1960s that did not feature the detective Ellery Queen. For instance, three novels featuring the governor's ""troubleshooter"" Mike McCall - The Campus Murders (1969, written by Gil Brewer); The Black Hearts Murder (1970, written by Richard Deming); and The Blue Movie Murders (1972, written by Edward D. Hoch) -- were published under the ""Ellery Queen"" byline. Jack Vance also wrote four of these book.)",5,"Put On Your Thinking Hats, Friends!",1276560000,"06 15, 2010",2010,6888,"['1975', 'Cult-Classic', 'TV', 'whodunit', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'starring',

Jim Hutton is one of my favorite actors and he was perfect for the role of Ellery Queen. I enjoy reading Ellery Queen Mysteries on paperpack. It consists of several short stories and they all hold my attention. Unlike some mysteries Ellery Queen shows you who is going to be dead in a few minutes and who the suspects will be. After that the story unfolds. At the end of the show Ellery announces he has solved the murder and invites the audience to match wits with him and guess who the murderer is. I welcome the challenge and sometimes I am right and others I am surprised at who the murderer is. One nice thing included with this set is a booklet with pictures and information about the actors and the show. It lists all the episodes on each disc. Very few dvd sets have any paperwork let alone a booklet. It was a nice surprise. If you are a mystery fan I would highly recommend this set to add to your collection.,5,Great Mystery Series,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,987,"['have', 'been', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'series', 'come', 'out', 'dvd', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'enjoy', 'reading', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'Mysteries', 'paperpack', 'several', 'short', 'stories', 'hold', 'attention', 'mysteries', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'dead', 'few', 'minutes', 'who', 'suspects', 'will', 'be', 'story', 'unfolds', 'end', 'show', 'Ellery', 'solved', 'murder', 'audience', 'match', 'wits', 'guess', 'who', 'murderer', 'welcome', 'challenge', 'sometimes', 'am', 'right', 'others', 'am', 'surprised', 'who', 'murderer', 'One', 'nice', 'thing', 'included', 'set', 'booklet', 'pictures', 'information', 'actors', 'show', 'episodes', 'disc', 'Very', 'few', 'dvd', 'sets', 'have', 'paperwork', 'let', 'alone', 'booklet', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', 'are', 'mystery', 'fan', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'add', 'collection']",Ellery Queen Mysteries

1360990,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B003RHZ6CK,Gary P. Cohen,"[4, 5]","I never really enjoyed this series when it was originally shown in 1975.  I was never a great fan of the late Jim Hutton (although I did like him a lot in the Duke's ""The Green Berets."")  However I decided to pick up this series on dvd and I've been enjoying it more.The series is similar to one of my all-time favorites: ""Burkes Law.""  Usually a very unlikeable character is killed at the beginning of the show.  There are numerous suspects played by various guest stars.  Ellery, a mystery novelist, usually gets involved due to his father N.Y. Police Inspector, Richard Queens, investigating the case.  Ellery is usually at a loss until (like Amos Burke,) someone says some innocuous thing that give him a clue into solving the mystery.  Ellery, as portrayed by Hutton, is sort of an idiot savant.He seems to live in a world of his own and  would forget his head if it wasn't on his shoulders, but he can figure out a mystery like nobody's business.  He is a man in the mid-40s who has no problem living with his Inspector father (well-played by David Wayne.)The show takes place in New York in the late 1940s and portrays that era and locale very well.  The show also has a nice line-up of guest stars, (including the great Vincent Price in one episode,) who sadly, for the most part, are no longer with us.The episodes are very nicely produced and enjoyable for a relaxing hour of mystery.  The dvd set includes an interview with one of the co-creators and producers, Richard Levinson who along with his late partner William Link created this series and many others (including ""Columbo."")As stated previously, I never really cared for this series during its original 1 year run on NBC.  However, the nice thing with dvds are we get the chance to rediscover them again.

1361025,A2NLIB986TEESZ,B003RHZ6CK,L. M Young,"[3, 3]","I was eighteen when the pilot movie for this series aired. As a 1940s and OTR buff, this series was tailor-made for me, not to mention that one of my favorite character actors, David Wayne, was portraying Inspector Richard Queen. Jim Hutton, who I was familiar with from THE GREEN BERETS and THE HORIZONTAL LIEUTENANT, played a loveable, absent-minded, but sharp Ellery. (I found out later that the Dannay/Lee families said that Hutton's portrayal was very close to the actual personality of one of the authors.) Week after week I would ""match wits"" with Ellery and try to guess the identity of the murderer. (I even kept score in my journal; alas, in the end Ellery ""out-sleuthed"" me.) I liked best the stories where knowing a certain word or concept would give you the clue to the killer's identity.The guest cast was filled with delightful character actors, from the 1970s regulars of the ""Universal Studios repertory group"" as I called them, to veteran performers who went back to radio and vaudeville, like George Burns, William Frawley, Eve Arden, and Eddie Bracken, and all the 1940s settings and references were equally delightful. Along the way QUEEN satirized a number of subjects, such as Hollywood changing writers' scripts and the movie scene; addressed hot subjects of the 1940s, such as the early payola scandals and war crimes; and even presaged the comic book violence controversy of the 1950s.A particular delight of the series was John Hillerman's portrayal of Simon Brimmer, an unctious radio mystery story star who fancied himself a sleuth. Brimmer would somehow always come up with the wrong suspect, only to be corrected by Ellery in the climactic scene. Indeed, radio stories played a part in several of the mysteries, and many times the wordplay of the structure of the episodes themselves harked back to radio. Ken Swofferd is also fun as Frank Flannigan, a bombastic hack reporter.This is a nice, solid release of the series which includes the pilot film TOO MANY SUSPECTS. The episodes are sharp and crisp, with typical television sound of the time, which is not unpleasant.

If you have just been stabbed or shot, wouldn't you like to leave a clue to the identity of your killer before you take your last breath.  You can't count on paper and pen being handy, you will have to improvise with whatever is in reach ...Sometimes a ""dying clue"" seems obvious, but it can easily lead you astray.  It may seem to point to one suspect, when it actually points to another or it may point to more than one suspect.  Worse yet, although it is an obvious ""dying clue"", it doesn't appear to point at any suspects.  And, worst of all, sometimes there appears to be no ""dying clue"".These episodes make a great mystery game:  Before watching an episode, write down the suspects from the opening narrative; these narratives are also printed in the included reference guide.  Take notes of your observations, what you hear, and any conclusions you may draw as you watch.  Near the end of each episode, Ellery will look you in the eye and ask if you know whodunit.  If you don't know, replay it to see what you missed.  Once you think you know, then play the ending.Special feature: ""Interview with William Link"".  He was one of the producers of the series.Caution:  Be careful when removing the lower discs.

1361029,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,B003RHZ6CK,Marty Gillis,"[7, 7]","I knew immediately after seeing this set first advertised that it was something I was going to have to get!  I am old enough to have watched this show when it was new back in 1975 when I was an idiot of 20.  Now I am an idiot of 55 and can easily see why I was so excited about seeing this show again.  It truly is a huge slice of quality taken from a sea of 70's television mediocrity.Ellery Queen is a wonderful example of what can go RIGHT when you combine the right writers with the right actors.  This show has a real chemistry unlike most 70's fare.  Some have compared the semi-faded  A and B List actors to the guest star rosters of The Love Boat and Fantasy Island, but in THIS case it works and works quite well.  There is a certain flavor to this program that shows like Murder She Wrote WISHED they could have emulated.  It is hard to put your finger on just WHAT makes Ellery Queen such a great program.  Is it the scripts from the legendary writing team of Link and Levinson?  Is it the acting ability and chemistry between ace actors Jim Hutton and David Wayne? The inclusion of the Simon Brimmer character played to the hilt by the great John Hillerman?  Perhaps it is the musical score by Elmer Bernstein?  Or the quasi authentic 40's production design and costumes?  Just WHAT makes this show so great and WHY does it stand the test of time 35 years later?The answer, of course, is All of the above.  The perfect combination of elements working in a once in a blue moon (for television) synergy.  Popping in the first DVD and settling back for the pilot episode was like revisiting old friends.  I have long since forgotten the plots and the solutions, so it is all new to me once again.  Just the thing for a cold winter day or night, with a hot beverage and the fire going.Also, this set represents some true value.  The video transfers themselves are a cut above.  No, the source was not restored as far as I can see, there are still some imperfection from the film source itself, but it is also obvious that the original film elements were scanned at a reasonably high resolution for this DVD presentation and the result is a crisp , clear, vibrant image that far surpasses what was broadcast by NBC back in 1975.  The sound, while mono,is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0, (ALL TV sound was MONO in 1975)and remains faithful to the original broadcast. It is truly clear as a bell with the full frequency spectrum represented. Sound can sometimes be very problematic on older shows but is not the case here at all.  I have never had to strain to hear any dialogue and the score sounds just great!  A nicely printed booklet is included which adds both value and extra enjoyment to the set and is a welcome inclusion.My ONLY complaint about this set are the piggy back style discs holders which are a pain.  To ensure my discs will stay in tip top condition over repeated viewings I will place all 6 discs in separate sleeves as I just don't trust myself (arthritis) not to damage a disc one day while trying to remove it.If you are a mystery fan this set will most likely entertain and delight you.  If you remember this show from 'back in the day' and wonder if it was as good as you remember, IT IS!  I would have purchased the Ellery Queen Box set for 75 dollars and been quite happy.  As it is, it sells for half that price and is well worth it.  11 out of 10 for the content,  7 out of 10 for the packaging.",5,Not ALL 70's Television was bad!,1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,3431,"['knew', 'immediately', 'seeing', 'set', 'first', 'advertised', 'was', 'something', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'get', 'am', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'watched', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'back', '1975', 'when', 'was', 'idiot', '20', 'Now', 'am', 'idiot', '55', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'seeing', 'show', 'again', 'truly', 'huge', 'slice', 'quality', 'taken', 'sea', '70', 'television', 'mediocrity.Ellery', 'Queen', 'wonderful', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'go', 'RIGHT', 'when', 'combine', 'right', 'writers', 'right', 'actors', 'show', 'real', 'chemistry', 'most', '70', 'fare', 'have', 'compared', 'semi-faded', 'A', 'B', 'List', 'actors', 'guest', 'star', 'rosters', 'Love', 'Boat', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'THIS', 'case', 'quite', 'well', 'certain', 'flavor', 'program', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'WISHED', 'could', 'have', 'emulated', 'hard', 'put', 'finger', 'just', 'WHAT', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'great', 'program', 'scripts', 'legendary', 'writing', 'team', 'Link', 'Levinson', 'acting', 'ability', 'chemistry', 'ace', 'actors', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'David', 'Wayne', 'inclusion', 'Simon', 'Brimmer', 'character', 'played', 'hilt', 'great', 'John', 'Hillerman', 'Perhaps', 'musical', 'score', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'quasi', 'authentic', '40', 'production', 'design', 'costumes', 'Just', 'WHAT', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'WHY', 'stand', 'test', 'time', '35', 'years', 'later', 'answer', 'course', 'All', 'above', 'perfect', 'combination', 'elements', 'working', 'once', 'blue', 'moon', 'television', 'synergy', 'Popping', 'first', 'DVD', 'settling', 'back', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'revisiting', 'old', 'friends', 'have', 'long', 'forgotten', 'plots', 'solutions', 'new', 'once', 'again', 'Just', 'thing', 'cold', 'winter', 'day', 'night', 'hot', 'beverage', 'fire', 'going.Also', 'set', 'true', 'value', 'video', 'transfers', 'are', 'cut', 'No', 'source', 'was', 'not', 'restored', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'still', 'imperfection', 'film', 'source', 'also', 'obvious', 'original', 'film', 'elements', 'were', 'scanned', 'reasonably', 'high', 'resolution', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'result', 'crisp', 'clear', 'vibrant', 'image', 'far', 'what', 'was', 'broadcast', 'NBC', 'back', '1975', 'sound', 'mono', 'presented', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'ALL', 'TV', 'sound', 'was', 'MONO', '1975', 'faithful', 'original', 'broadcast', 'truly', 'clear', 'bell', 'full', 'frequency', 'spectrum', 'represented', 'Sound', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'very', 'problematic', 'older', 'shows', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'strain', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'score', 'just', 'great', 'nicely', 'printed', 'booklet', 'included', 'value', 'extra', 'enjoyment', 'set', 'welcome', 'inclusion.My', 'ONLY', 'complaint', 'set', 'are', 'piggy', 'back', 'style', 'discs', 'holders', 'are', 'pain', 'ensure', 'discs', 'will', 'stay', 'tip', 'top', 'condition', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'will', 'place', '6', 'discs', 'separate', 'sleeves', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'arthritis', 'not', 'damage', 'disc', 'one', 'day', 'trying', 'remove', 'it.If', 'are', 'mystery', 'fan', 'set', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'entertain', 'delight', 'remember', 'show', ""'back"", 'day', 'wonder', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'remember', 'IT', 'would', 'have', 'purchased', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'Box', 'set', '75', 'dollars', 'been', 'quite', 'happy', 'half', 'price', 'well', 'worth', '11', '10', 'content', '7', '10', 'packaging']",Ellery Queen Mysteries

There have been a number of very helpful reviews of the series already posted, but since all of them were prior to release, I'm just chiming in here to add the following:Most importantly, the series was every bit as good when I viewed it last night as it was in my memory, where, believe me, it was pretty danged good. That's no mean feat! The acting, the pacing of the episodes (I watched Too Many Suspects and The Adventure of Auld Lang Syne) and the mysteries themselves were all uniformly excellent. It was a pleasure to get reacquainted with Jim Hutton, too, whose work I've always enjoyed and have missed.The picture and sound are very good. I'm not a video/audio techy person, so I can't go into particulars and while I could see that the picture wasn't up to blu-ray standards, I was completely satisfied.The case is nice and includes a Reference Guide with a synopsis of each of the episodes, some color stills and essays from Janet Hutchings (editor of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine) and Andrew Gulli (Managing Editor of The Strand Magazine).IMHO, the producers of the DVDs have done this great series proud and I'm so glad they finally got around to it!Very highly recommended.One last note: If there are any fans of this series who have never gotten around to reading the Ellery Queen books (the ones starring Ellery), I highly recommend that you give them a try as well. They're intricate and superbly plotted as well as being very entertaining reads. On my shelf, they sit alongside Agatha Christie, which is about the highest praise I can give them. :)",5,As Good As I Remembered,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,1677,"['received', 'copy', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'Mysteries', 'yesterday', 'watched', 'couple', 'episodes', 'last', 'night', 'have', 'been', 'number', 'very', 'helpful', 'reviews', 'series', 'already', 'posted', 'were', 'prior', 'release', ""'m"", 'just', 'chiming', 'here', 'add', 'following', 'Most', 'importantly', 'series', 'was', 'bit', 'good', 'when', 'viewed', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'memory', 'where', 'believe', 'was', 'pretty', 'danged', 'good', 'mean', 'feat', 'acting', 'pacing', 'episodes', 'watched', 'Too', 'Many', 'Suspects', 'Adventure', 'Auld', 'Lang', 'Syne', 'mysteries', 'were', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'was', 'pleasure', 'get', 'reacquainted', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'too', 'work', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'missed.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'very', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'video/audio', 'techy', 'person', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'particulars', 'could', 'see', 'picture', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'blu-ray', 'standards', 'was', 'completely', 'satisfied.The', 'case', 'nice', 'Reference', 'Guide', 'synopsis', 'episodes', 'color', 'stills', 'essays', 'Janet', 'Hutchings', 'editor', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'Mystery', 'Magazine', 'Andrew', 'Gulli', 'Managing', 'Editor', 'Strand', 'Magazine', '.IMHO', 'producers', 'DVDs', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'series', 'proud', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'finally', 'got', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended.One', 'last', 'note', 'are', 'fans', 'series', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'gotten', 'reading', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'books', 'ones', 'starring', 'Ellery', 'highly', 'recommend', 'give', 'try', 'as', 'well', ""'re"", 'intricate', 'superbly', 'plotted', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'very', 'entertaining', 'reads', 'shelf', 'sit', 'alongside', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'highest', 'praise', 'can', 'give']",Ellery Queen Mysteries

1361034,A25OKVCJDREQIF,B003RHZ6CK,Miland Joshi,"[1, 1]","I first watched ""The Ellery Queen Whodunit"" while still at school, in the 70s on BBC television, when VCRs were not so widespread and DVDs hadn't yet been invented. I was intrigued by its special feature, that near the end of the episode, the detective would turn to the viewers and challenge them to solve the mystery. Lacking a photographic memory and the ability to immediately process the relevant clues with a creative imagination, the prospects of success in most cases seemed slim.I am very pleased that the series has come out at last on DVD, because it makes this enjoyment a realistic prospect at last. I would urge viewers to stop the DVD at the ""challenge"" when Jim Hutton as EQ breaks the fourth wall, and see the episode again, thinking about the clues and possible solutions, even a number of times, before moving on. By this, the enjoyment of the final solution, even the viewer does not find it, should be much enhanced.The DVD set also has an informative interview with one of the creators of the TV series, William Link, an Ellery Queen fan himself.Other welcome features are the pilot, ""Too many suspects"", effectively a double-length episode, just as good as the others. Also welcome are the teaser trailers with spinning question marks, which were not shown on the BBC.The star, Jim Hutton had made a detective film earlier in 1970, ""They call it murder"", certainly worth seeing, but not as fine as this series. Sadly Hutton passed away in 1979, a few years after the series was released, so this DVD set will be a worthwhile part of his legacy.One criticism of this particular edition is that the mystery movie theme of Henry Mancini has been substituted for the pilot film's original title music by Elmer Bernstein, which was an extended version of the one used for the episodes. Hopefully an edition containing the authentic theme will become available eventually, as well as on a soundtrack album on CD.Minor criticisms could be made of the episodes. In one I felt that an essential clue (the fact of a blackmail) wasn't sufficiently explicit beforehand. In the ""challenge"" in another, in my view the word ""earlier"" would have been more appropriate than ""later"".

I never thought it was all that popular, but I remember watching it as a kid.....and I could never figure out ""How Done It."" Well, I still can't, really, though you can, for the most part get the idea of what was happening and how they got to conclusion. For those who have not seen this, prepare yourself, because I don't think they used more than two cameras (how I miss the days when television was not about constantly flashing images in your face). The banter and interaction between the characters is excellent. The acting is on par (if not better) for the time. It may seem a bit over done now, however, this was a different time. I like the story line, as well as the implied violence. By that I mean that I like that they did not show the murders and violence, but rather left that to the viewers imagination. There was no need for graphic violence, etc.. Too bad it was such a short series.....it did not really hit its stride.So, why 4 out of 5 stars? Well, I wasn't that impressed with the transfer quality. Playing them on my blu-ray, as well as my regular dvd players, (both of which upconvert), the image was not as crisp as I had expected, and in some places was just unacceptable for something that could have been easily remastered well. The sound quality is not bad, but could have been improved. None of these are deal breakers, and in fairness, I do not know what they had to work with. Also, nothing is THAT bad to make them deal-breakers. As for the disc holders, well, I have to say, I'm not thrilled with having one disc sit overlapped on another, and am wondering exactly how much it saved them (if anything). Lastly, I would love to have seen outtakes. There really isn't much in the way of bonus material, etc. If you liked the old televesion program, you will love this. If you watch a lot of present day programming, you probably will not enjoy this, mainly because of how it was originally shot....of course, this is could be used as a way to help hone attention span. ;-)",4,Takes me back.....,1287878400,"10 24, 2010",2010,2102,"['Having', 'purchased', 'local', 'wholesale', 'club', 'store', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', 'was', 'last', 'box', 'never', 'thought', 'was', 'popular', 'remember', 'watching', 'kid', '..and', 'could', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'How', 'Done', 'Well', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'can', 'most', 'part', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'how', 'got', 'conclusion', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'prepare', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'used', 'more', 'two', 'cameras', 'how', 'miss', 'days', 'when', 'television', 'was', 'not', 'about', 'constantly', 'flashing', 'images', 'face', 'banter', 'interaction', 'characters', 'excellent', 'acting', 'par', 'not', 'better', 'time', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'done', 'now', 'however', 'was', 'different', 'time', 'story', 'line', 'as', 'well', 'implied', 'violence', 'mean', 'like', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'murders', 'violence', 'rather', 'left', 'viewers', 'imagination', 'was', 'need', 'graphic', 'violence', 'etc..', 'Too', 'bad', 'was', 'such', 'short', 'series', '..it', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'hit', 'stride.So', 'why', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Well', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'transfer', 'quality', 'Playing', 'blu-ray', 'as', 'well', 'regular', 'dvd', 'players', 'upconvert', 'image', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'crisp', 'had', 'expected', 'places', 'was', 'just', 'unacceptable', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'remastered', 'well', 'sound', 'quality', 'not', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'None', 'are', 'deal', 'breakers', 'fairness', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'Also', 'nothing', 'bad', 'make', 'deal-breakers', 'disc', 'holders', 'well', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'thrilled', 'having', 'one', 'disc', 'sit', 'overlapped', 'am', 'wondering', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'saved', 'anything', 'Lastly', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'outtakes', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'bonus', 'material', 'etc', 'liked', 'old', 'televesion', 'program', 'will', 'love', 'watch', 'lot', 'present', 'day', 'programming', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'enjoy', 'mainly', 'how', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', '.of', 'course', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'way', 'help', 'hone', 'attention', 'span']",Ellery Queen Mysteries

Hutton,playing sleuth Ellery Queen would turn directly to the camera and address the audience,teasing them by claiming to have solved the puzzle and assuming that the audience had too..In most cases,since the clues,such as they were,were so obscure as to be invisible,the audience had not solved the crime and,doubtlessly,they still wondered how they might have done so even if they had noticed the clues ..In one show a knowledge of the german language was a necessity in order to know that a broken bottle of german wine gives the clue to the culprit,but one would only know this if one could translate the culprits name from english to german...In another episode it is revealed that the culprit had supplied a former client  with drugs in order to keep her functioning and in order

""Ellery Queen"" and the novels of Agatha Christie cultivated my love for the mystery genre to this day - and AT LONG LAST it's brilliant to see the entire series in one boxed set on DVD, digitally remastered and looking even better than in their original airings on NBC!And, after much speculation, I am so glad to see that the pilot film, ""Too Many Suspect,"" is included in the boxed set.  So truly, this is the COMPLETE ""Ellery Queen""!I received my set today, and have already watched two episodes featuring brilliant guest stars such as Eve Arden, Bert Park, Betty White, Tom Bosley, and Donald O'Connor.  That was one of the most enjoyable things about watching the show; you never knew who would be guest-starring, and indeed the guests list throughout the brief series (22 episodes) reads like a who's-who of famous stars and character actors from the 1970's and before.Set during the years immediately after World War II, the series often started with Inspector Queen getting involved in a puzzling murder - one that he would either bring his son Ellery (a famous writer of ""whodunnits"") in on ... or, in some cases, Ellery would be so intrigued by the case, he'd tag along.  With the police baffled, Ellery would investigate in his own quiet, intuitive style, his analytical mind often finding clues in places or people the police have overlooked entirely.  Then, close to the end, Ellery would figure out the killer ... and, in a brilliant move that set the series apart from any other, he would turn to the camera and directly address the audience, briefly going over the clues and asking (or sometimes assuming) viewers if they came to the same conclusion he did, before summoning the suspects together to reveal all.It was a terrific format, the stories well-written and overseen by the creators of shows like ""Columbo"" and ""Murder She Wrote.""  Other than Ellery and his dad, the series was also populated by a variety of colorful secondary characters - including a muckraking columnist, a serious and quite big police sergeant who was the inspector's right-hand man ... and even a popular radio show host, named Simon Brimmer (and played to perfection by the great John Hillerman), who would often investigate and reach the solution before Ellery - usually the wrong solution.""Ellery Queen"" is an incredible walk down memory lane, lighthearted and sometimes even humorous fun mixed in with the drama.  Wonderfully acted and written, and very evocative of the styles and mores of its time setting (1940's New York City), this boxed set is a real treat; an early birthday gift I treated myself to, and a fantastic show done justice on DVD.",5,At Long Last: EQ on DVD!!,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,2830,"['Not', 'age', 'grew', 'up', 'amazing', 'show', 'starring', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'character', 'actor', 'veteran', 'David', 'Wayne', 'police', 'inspector', 'father', 'Richard', 'Queen', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'novels', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'cultivated', 'love', 'mystery', 'genre', 'day', 'AT', 'LONG', 'LAST', 'brilliant', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'boxed', 'set', 'DVD', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'looking', 'even', 'better', 'original', 'airings', 'NBC', 'much', 'speculation', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'see', 'pilot', 'film', 'Too', 'Many', 'Suspect', 'included', 'boxed', 'set', 'So', 'truly', 'COMPLETE', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'received', 'set', 'today', 'have', 'already', 'watched', 'two', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'brilliant', 'guest', 'stars', 'such', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'Bert', 'Park', 'Betty', 'White', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'was', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'things', 'watching', 'show', 'never', 'knew', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'guest-starring', 'indeed', 'guests', 'list', 'brief', 'series', '22', 'episodes', 'reads', ""who's-who"", 'famous', 'stars', 'character', 'actors', '1970', 'before.Set', 'years', 'immediately', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'series', 'often', 'started', 'Inspector', 'Queen', 'getting', 'involved', 'puzzling', 'murder', 'one', 'would', 'either', 'bring', 'son', 'Ellery', 'famous', 'writer', 'whodunnits', 'cases', 'Ellery', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'intrigued', 'case', ""'d"", 'tag', 'along', 'police', 'baffled', 'Ellery', 'would', 'investigate', 'own', 'quiet', 'intuitive', 'style', 'analytical', 'mind', 'often', 'finding', 'clues', 'places', 'people', 'police', 'have', 'overlooked', 'entirely', 'Then', 'close', 'end', 'Ellery', 'would', 'figure', 'out', 'killer', 'brilliant', 'move', 'set', 'series', 'apart', 'other', 'would', 'turn', 'camera', 'directly', 'address', 'audience', 'briefly', 'going', 'clues', 'asking', 'sometimes', 'assuming', 'viewers', 'came', 'same', 'conclusion', 'did', 'summoning', 'suspects', 'together', 'reveal', 'all.It', 'was', 'terrific', 'format', 'stories', 'well-written', 'overseen', 'creators', 'shows', 'Columbo', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Other', 'Ellery', 'dad', 'series', 'was', 'also', 'populated', 'variety', 'colorful', 'secondary', 'characters', 'including', 'muckraking', 'columnist', 'serious', 'quite', 'big', 'police', 'sergeant', 'who', 'was', 'inspector', 'right-hand', 'man', 'even', 'popular', 'radio', 'show', 'host', 'named', 'Simon', 'Brimmer', 'played', 'perfection', 'great', 'John', 'Hillerman', 'who', 'would', 'often', 'investigate', 'reach', 'solution', 'Ellery', 'usually', 'wrong', 'solution', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'incredible', 'walk', 'memory', 'lane', 'lighthearted', 'sometimes', 'even', 'humorous', 'fun', 'mixed', 'drama', 'Wonderfully', 'acted', 'written', 'very', 'evocative', 'styles', 'mores', 'time', 'setting', '1940', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'boxed', 'set', 'real', 'treat', 'early', 'birthday', 'gift', 'treated', 'fantastic', 'show', 'done', 'justice', 'DVD']",Ellery Queen Mysteries

So many things that I remembered loving as a kid are just not the same when viewed with far older eyes, and I was afraid that this would be the case here. I am so glad that I was wrong! I was and still am  a huge fan of shows like Columbo, McCloud, McMillan and Wife, and Banacek; this show ranks up there with them and I throughly enjoyed melting into an inert puddle one weekend while watching the DVD set. First of all, I had forgotten that the characters were set in post-WWII New York, and the atmosphere suited the mysteries extremely well. It was nice seeing detective work without DNA and the  hi-tech we are used to today, although sometimes Inspector Queen, and Ellery himself,  so grossly contaminated the crime scene that it is amazing Ellery didn't go off on all manner of wild goose chases. Yes, not all the stories were particularly realistic or plausible but I wasn't that bothered by that- it was fun seeing Jim Hutton and the constant parade of highly recognizable guest stars in action. The breaking of the fourth wall at the end of each episode was something I  remembered well, and still enjoy. The quality of the DVD transfer was surprisingly good- I watched this on a bluray  player and a new HDTV and the images were quite sharp and clear. The episode reference guide that accompanies the dvd's was a nice touch.  There aren't a lot of extras on the DVD but I don't really consider that a detriment to my enjoyment of the series.",5,Wish there were more!,1308528000,"06 20, 2011",2011,1590,"['remember', 'watching', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'great', 'When', 'found', 'DVD', 'set', 'available', 'wondered', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'remembered', 'loving', 'kid', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'when', 'viewed', 'far', 'older', 'eyes', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'here', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'still', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'shows', 'Columbo', 'McCloud', 'McMillan', 'Wife', 'Banacek', 'show', 'up', 'there', 'throughly', 'enjoyed', 'melting', 'inert', 'puddle', 'one', 'weekend', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set', 'First', 'had', 'forgotten', 'characters', 'were', 'set', 'post-WWII', 'New', 'York', 'atmosphere', 'suited', 'mysteries', 'extremely', 'well', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'detective', 'work', 'DNA', 'hi-tech', 'are', 'used', 'today', 'sometimes', 'Inspector', 'Queen', 'Ellery', 'so', 'grossly', 'contaminated', 'crime', 'scene', 'amazing', 'Ellery', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'off', 'manner', 'wild', 'goose', 'chases', 'Yes', 'not', 'stories', 'were', 'particularly', 'realistic', 'plausible', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'bothered', 'that-', 'was', 'fun', 'seeing', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'constant', 'parade', 'highly', 'recognizable', 'guest', 'stars', 'action', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'end', 'episode', 'was', 'something', 'remembered', 'well', 'still', 'enjoy', 'quality', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good-', 'watched', 'bluray', 'player', 'new', 'HDTV', 'images', 'were', 'quite', 'sharp', 'clear', 'episode', 'reference', 'guide', 'dvd', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'extras', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'consider', 'detriment', 'enjoyment', 'series']",Ellery Queen Mysteries

1361069,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B003RHZ6CK,trebe,"[122, 130]","The writing team of Manfred B. Lee and Frederic Dannay, were cousins who collaborated together, and under the pseudonym ""Ellery Queen"", produced mystery novels featuring a detective of the same name.  Their first novel featuring Ellery Queen, was published in 1929, and the detective would be featured in books for the next forty years.Running just one season, the television series Ellery Queen Mysteries (1975-76) was based on the fictional detective, and was produced by William Link and Richard Levinson, the same team responsible for Columbo, and later Murder She Wrote.  The series was set in New York sometime after the end of World War II, and opened with a provocative introduction and Elmer Bernstein's catchy theme.The casting was simply stellar, as Jim Hutton (The Green Berets) and David Wayne in the lead roles, had wonderful chemistry together.  Hutton was marvelous as Ellery Queen, a writer of mystery novels, with some odd personality quirks.  Ellery shared an apartment with his father Inspector Richard Queen (Wayne), the NYPD's chief of detectives.  It was through this connection, that the younger Queen often became involved in bizarre and challenging cases, mostly involving the upper crust of society.  The cast also included Queen's muscular right hand man, Sergeant Velie (Tom Reese).  Ken Swofford was slick reporter Frank Flanagan.  And a pre-Magnum P.I. John Hillerman was the uppity detective Simon Brimmer, host of the radio program The Casebook Of Simon Brimmer, who often attempted to match wits with Ellery.Dannay's and Lee's intricate mysteries were typically set in the times they were written, and the character evolved through the decades.  A device found in the early novels was the ""reader challenge"", where at a certain point, the reader was informed that all the necessary clues to solve the mystery had been provided, and the reader was invited to solve the case, before Ellery revealed the solution.  This same device was made a part of the Ellery Queen radio dramas in the 1940's, and then also carried over to the television series, as Jim Hutton would break character, and looking straight into the camera, review key points and ask the audience if they knew the solution to the case.The series pilot ""Too Many Suspects"" (included in the set), did well enough to justify greenlighting the series in the fall of 1975.  Well-written and produced with the Levinson and Link touch, the Ellery Queen Mysteries is great fun for lovers of classic whodunits.  The relationship between the two Queens is a key element, and David Wayne plays a great straight man to his eccentric and absent minded son.  The stories are compelling, and the presence of Frank Flanagan, and the snooty Simon Brimmer, adds some humor, and helps to keep things lively.  Originally a look back some thirty-five years to the 1940's, the series is now even more of a period piece in 2010.  Like many mystery dramas, it is a showcase for a multitude of well known stars of the era, including Vincent Price, Vera Miles, Ray Milland, Carolyn Jones, Howard Duff, Ida Lupino, George Burns, June Lockhart, Jim Backus, Eva Gabor, Bob Crane, Troy Donahue, Joan Collins, Dana Andrews, Kim Hunter, John Dehner, Lloyd Bochner, Ken Berry, Stuart Whitman, and Ed McMahon, just to name a few.Still fondly remembered by fans, this official release will introduce Ellery Queen to a whole new generation, some who may even be encouraged to explore the original novels.  Jim Hutton, was a very talented actor, who somehow never landed the leading roles he probably should have.  At six foot five, and with a likeable onscreen persona, he was often cast in supporting roles.  Hutton the father of actor Timothy Hutton, passed away from cancer in 1979, at the age of 45.  Highly recommended to mystery and detective story lovers, The Ellery Queen Mysteries provides an opportunity to see this gifted performer, doing some of his best work.",5,"go back in time, to solve the crime, with Ellery Queen . . .",1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,3933,"['writing', 'team', 'Manfred', 'B.', 'Lee', 'Frederic', 'Dannay', 'were', 'cousins', 'who', 'collaborated', 'together', 'pseudonym', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'produced', 'mystery', 'novels', 'featuring', 'detective', 'same', 'name', 'first', 'novel', 'featuring', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'was', 'published', '1929', 'detective', 'would', 'be', 'featured', 'books', 'next', 'forty', 'years.Running', 'just', 'one', 'season', 'television', 'series', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'Mysteries', '1975-76', 'was', 'based', 'fictional', 'detective', 'was', 'produced', 'William', 'Link', 'Richard', 'Levinson', 'same', 'team', 'responsible', 'Columbo', 'later', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'series', 'was', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'sometime', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'opened', 'provocative', 'introduction', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'catchy', 'theme.The', 'casting', 'was', 'simply', 'stellar', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'Green', 'Berets', 'David', 'Wayne', 'lead', 'roles', 'had', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Hutton', 'was', 'marvelous', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'writer', 'mystery', 'novels', 'odd', 'personality', 'quirks', 'Ellery', 'shared', 'apartment', 'father', 'Inspector', 'Richard', 'Queen', 'Wayne', 'NYPD', 'chief', 'detectives', 'was', 'connection', 'younger', 'Queen', 'often', 'became', 'involved', 'bizarre', 'challenging', 'cases', 'mostly', 'involving', 'upper', 'crust', 'society', 'cast', 'also', 'included', 'Queen', 'muscular', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Sergeant', 'Velie', 'Tom', 'Reese', 'Ken', 'Swofford', 'was', 'slick', 'reporter', 'Frank', 'Flanagan', 'pre-Magnum', 'P.I', 'John', 'Hillerman', 'was', 'uppity', 'detective', 'Simon', 'Brimmer', 'host', 'radio', 'program', 'Casebook', 'Simon', 'Brimmer', 'who', 'often', 'attempted', 'match', 'wits', 'Ellery.Dannay', 'Lee', 'intricate', 'mysteries', 'were', 'typically', 'set', 'times', 'were', 'written', 'character', 'evolved', 'decades', 'device', 'found', 'early', 'novels', 'was', 'reader', 'challenge', 'where', 'certain', 'point', 'reader', 'was', 'informed', 'necessary', 'clues', 'solve', 'mystery', 'had', 'been', 'provided', 'reader', 'was', 'invited', 'solve', 'case', 'Ellery', 'revealed', 'solution', 'same', 'device', 'was', 'made', 'part', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'radio', 'dramas', '1940', 'then', 'also', 'carried', 'television', 'series', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'would', 'break', 'character', 'looking', 'straight', 'camera', 'review', 'key', 'points', 'ask', 'audience', 'knew', 'solution', 'case.The', 'series', 'pilot', 'Too', 'Many', 'Suspects', 'included', 'set', 'did', 'well', 'enough', 'justify', 'greenlighting', 'series', 'fall', '1975', 'Well-written', 'produced', 'Levinson', 'Link', 'touch', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'Mysteries', 'great', 'fun', 'lovers', 'classic', 'whodunits', 'relationship', 'two', 'Queens', 'key', 'element', 'David', 'Wayne', 'great', 'straight', 'man', 'eccentric', 'absent', 'minded', 'son', 'stories', 'are', 'compelling', 'presence', 'Frank', 'Flanagan', 'snooty', 'Simon', 'Brimmer', 'humor', 'keep', 'things', 'lively', 'Originally', 'look', 'back', 'thirty-five', 'years', '1940', 'series', 'now', 'even', 'more', 'period', 'piece', '2010', 'many', 'mystery', 'dramas', 'showcase', 'multitude', 'well', 'known', 'stars', 'era', 'including', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'Carolyn', 'Jones', 'Howard', 'Duff', 'Ida', 'Lupino', 'George', 'Burns', 'June', 'Lockhart', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Eva', 'Gabor', 'Bob', 'Crane', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Kim', 'Hunter', 'John', 'Dehner', 'Lloyd', 'Bochner', 'Ken', 'Berry', 'Stuart', 'Whitman', 'Ed', 'McMahon', 'just', 'name', 'few.Still', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'fans', 'official', 'release', 'will', 'introduce', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'who', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'encouraged', 'explore', 'original', 'novels', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'somehow', 'never', 'landed', 'leading', 'roles', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'six', 'foot', 'five', 'likeable', 'onscreen', 'persona', 'was', 'often', 'cast', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Hutton', 'father', 'actor', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'passed', 'away', 'cancer', '1979', 'age', '45', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'mystery', 'detective', 'story', 'lovers', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'Mysteries', 'opportunity', 'see', 'gifted', 'performer', 'doing', 'best', 'work']",Ellery Queen Mysteries

The cheating business partner? The needy nephew? The gold-digger? Match wits with Ellery Queen, and see if you can guess Who Done It!""Whether due to ratings, the high cost of a weekly show set in the 1940s or star Jim Hutton's failing health, 1975's Ellery Queen only lasted a single season, but that at least meant the show never went into the kind of decline long running mystery shows inevitably run into as they run out of plots. As it is the show relies heavily on the same plot twist - the murder victim almost always leaves a dying clue to the murderer's identity while an unrelated example of Ellery's absentmindedness will give him the key to the mystery - that becomes almost as much of a gimmick as Queen breaking the fourth wall to address the audience and recap the clues before revealing whodunit. But the show still has fun with its conventions, throwing in knowing jokes about assembling all the suspects to reveal the killer and even allowing Ellery's father to come up with the guilty party in one episode and for the most part it plays fair and doesn't hide the evidence you need to solve the case yourself.At the heart of the show is the real easygoing chemistry between Jim Hutton and David Wayne as the likeable crime writer and his police commissioner father and a good cast of occasional supporting characters like John Hillerman's wonderfully supercilious radio mystery host always trying to gazump Ellery's cases or Ken Swofford's gossip columnist as well as Tom Reese's reliable cop to do the heavy lifting. They're complimented by a very impressive array of guest stars from old and new Hollywood, some effectively cast against type (Ken Berry turns in a surprisingly good dramatic performance in one episode that's a world away from his usual loveable idiots), most doing exactly what you'd expect: the roll call includes Vincent Price, Ray Milland, Walter Pidgeon, Don Ameche, Dana Andrews, Jim Backus, Eddie Bracken, Victor Buono, George Burns, Joan Collins, Troy Donahue, Mel Ferrer, Rhonda Fleming, Farley Granger, Larry Hagman, Kim Hunter, Carolyn Jones, Robert Loggia, Ida Lupino, Roddy McDowall, Vera Miles, Juliet Mills, Sal Mineo, Dorothy Malone, Lloyd Nolan, Donald O'Connor, Cesar Romero, Barbara Rush, Dean Stockwell, Susan Strasberg, Rudy Vallee, Dana Wynter among many other familiar character actors stretching back to the 30s. It has great production values too, with a surprisingly lavish recreation of 40s New York that may rely heavily on Universal's old props and costumes but always looks good even if half of the murder victims seem to live in the same house.It's a fun, genuinely good natured and highly enjoyable show, deftly made without becoming twee or too self-parodic, it's 22 episodes having many of the virtues of superior examples of the kind of programmers that the studio turned out on their better days in the era the show is set in, and thankfully the DVD gives them a decent showcase. Picture quality is good in the original fullframe ratio - no gratuitous cropping for widescreen TV here - with an 18-minute interview with producer William Link and a booklet as extras.

Smith ""Polymath""","[5, 5]","I was an avid viewer of this series when it first ran in 1975-1976, on a small black and white set in my grad student dorm room.  I was entranced by the literacy of the writing, the pitch perfect 1940s atmosphere, the parade of notable guest stars, and above all the casting of the major characters--Jim Hutton as the brilliant but bemused Ellery, David Wayne as the irascible Inspector Queen, John Hillerman as the oily Simon Brimmer, and Ken Swofford as hyperkinetic columnist Frank Flannegan.  It was perhaps the only TV mystery series to invite the viewer to solve the mystery along with the main character--a charming example of breaking the fourth wall, and possible because all the clues really were revealed--always evident on the second viewing.Why this show was not renewed after its first season was incomprehensible; why it has been essentially unavailable since 1976 a mystery beyond fathoming.  To have the entire series elegantly boxed with good quality transfers is a wonderful gift to anyone who craves literate entertainments.I'm a long term fan of mysteries--books, movies, and TV.  No one with a serious interest in mysteries should pass this up.  Among the Link / Levinson programs, the only one that maintained a comparable standard was Murder, She Wrote--and Ellergy Queen is far, far better than the longer running Columbo.I could go on--but this show is so good that it is beyond criticism.  Somehow all the planets aligned to create something of a miracle, and it is now readily available again for all of us to enjoy.  As Frank Flannegan might say--it's Queenerific!",5,Perhaps the most welcome DVD release of the year.....,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,1593,"['was', 'avid', 'viewer', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'ran', '1975-1976', 'small', 'black', 'white', 'set', 'grad', 'student', 'dorm', 'room', 'was', 'entranced', 'literacy', 'writing', 'pitch', 'perfect', '1940s', 'atmosphere', 'parade', 'notable', 'guest', 'stars', 'casting', 'major', 'characters', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'brilliant', 'bemused', 'Ellery', 'David', 'Wayne', 'irascible', 'Inspector', 'Queen', 'John', 'Hillerman', 'oily', 'Simon', 'Brimmer', 'Ken', 'Swofford', 'hyperkinetic', 'columnist', 'Frank', 'Flannegan', 'was', 'perhaps', 'only', 'TV', 'mystery', 'series', 'invite', 'viewer', 'solve', 'mystery', 'main', 'character', 'charming', 'example', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'possible', 'clues', 'really', 'were', 'revealed', 'always', 'evident', 'second', 'viewing.Why', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'renewed', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'incomprehensible', 'why', 'been', 'essentially', 'unavailable', '1976', 'mystery', 'fathoming', 'have', 'entire', 'series', 'elegantly', 'boxed', 'good', 'quality', 'transfers', 'wonderful', 'gift', 'anyone', 'who', 'literate', 'entertainments.I', ""'m"", 'long', 'term', 'fan', 'mysteries', 'books', 'movies', 'TV', 'one', 'serious', 'interest', 'mysteries', 'should', 'pass', 'up', 'Link', '/', 'Levinson', 'programs', 'only', 'one', 'maintained', 'comparable', 'standard', 'was', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'Ellergy', 'Queen', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'longer', 'running', 'Columbo.I', 'could', 'go', 'show', 'so', 'good', 'criticism', 'Somehow', 'planets', 'aligned', 'create', 'something', 'miracle', 'now', 'readily', 'available', 'again', 'enjoy', 'Frank', 'Flannegan', 'might', 'say', 'Queenerific']",Ellery Queen Mysteries
1361078,A208I29OP8ZIRP,B003RHZ6CK,"William J. Irvin ""Mr. Movie""","[10, 11]","I have to say that I really like this release. I am over 50 years old now and was quite young when this show aired (weren't we all, though??) but my father loved it and every time I watched it, I was enchanted. As many others have said, Hutton and Wayne played off each other quite well and were very fun to watch. As I watch this series today, I get such a charge out of both the characters of Simon Brimmer and Frank Flanagan. Who was the better 'foil' for Ellery? Neither of them (to my knowledge) appeared in the books or the old radio show, and I think they add a fun touch to the series. Both are always trying to outguess Ellery and, of course, fail miserably. Brimmer was an arrogant elitist who considered himself an expert on crime detection merely because he played a detective on the radio, while Flanagan was a gossip-mongering reporter who always wanted to 'scoop' Ellery's latest case.This was a very charming show and I don't quite know why it didn't last beyond a single season but, that's just my taste, I guess. I still find myself wondering who I really like better. Flanagan or Brimmer. But they were both fun.As far as delivering a review, I think the packaging is okay (I give it 3 stars. The overlapping discs, while they save space on my library shelf, are a bit annoying) and there are no features to speak of other than a 22-page episode guide which merely rehashes each show. The show itself gets at least 4 stars from me and maybe even 5, I like it that much. I realize both Jim Hutton and David Wayne are gone now, but it would have been nice to have some sort of added features like interviews or thoughts or memories from some of the guest stars or perhaps some insight into the making of the show, but all in all, this is a very good package of a classic '70s TV show and I am happy with it. This is the best we Ellery fans will get, and I think it works well.Peace.",4,Who was the better foil?,1289001600,"11 6, 2010",2010,1899,"['have', 'say', 'really', 'release', 'am', '50', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'was', 'quite', 'young', 'when', 'show', 'aired', 'were', ""n't"", 'father', 'loved', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'enchanted', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'Hutton', 'Wayne', 'played', 'off', 'other', 'quite', 'well', 'were', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'watch', 'series', 'today', 'get', 'such', 'charge', 'characters', 'Simon', 'Brimmer', 'Frank', 'Flanagan', 'Who', 'was', 'better', ""'foil"", 'Ellery', 'Neither', 'knowledge', 'appeared', 'books', 'old', 'radio', 'show', 'think', 'add', 'fun', 'touch', 'series', 'are', 'always', 'trying', 'outguess', 'Ellery', 'course', 'fail', 'miserably', 'Brimmer', 'was', 'arrogant', 'elitist', 'who', 'considered', 'expert', 'crime', 'detection', 'merely', 'played', 'detective', 'radio', 'Flanagan', 'was', 'gossip-mongering', 'reporter', 'who', 'always', 'wanted', ""'scoop"", 'Ellery', 'latest', 'case.This', 'was', 'very', 'charming', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'single', 'season', 'just', 'taste', 'guess', 'still', 'find', 'wondering', 'who', 'really', 'better', 'Flanagan', 'Brimmer', 'were', 'fun.As', 'far', 'delivering', 'review', 'think', 'packaging', 'okay', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'overlapping', 'discs', 'save', 'space', 'library', 'shelf', 'are', 'bit', 'annoying', 'are', 'features', 'speak', 'other', '22-page', 'episode', 'guide', 'merely', 'show', 'show', 'least', '4', 'stars', 'maybe', 'even', '5', 'like', 'much', 'realize', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'David', 'Wayne', 'are', 'gone', 'now', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'sort', 'added', 'features', 'interviews', 'thoughts', 'memories', 'guest', 'stars', 'perhaps', 'insight', 'making', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'package', 'classic', 'TV', 'show', 'am', 'happy', 'best', 'Ellery', 'fans', 'will', 'get', 'think', 'well.Peace']",Ellery Queen Mysteries
