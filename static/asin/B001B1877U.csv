Very low budget, and without giving too much away, if you needed a movie that's a poor-mans cross between The Sixth Sense and The Others, go rent this for free from Redbox like I did.

It was entertaining enough with an unusual style.  I thought the acting was transparent in some spots, and the music, suitable at first,  tended to get annoying later.  But this movie has a very strange feel; that's what kept me glued to it.I don't want to reveal anything, but you'll probably start to work it out fairly early in the film, because this ""twist"" has been twisted before.Still a good one, though.  Once again, Lionsgate does not disappoint.",3,Atmosphere............,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,580,"['usually', 'enjoy', 'anything', 'Lionsgate', 'name', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'Lionsgate', 'flick', 'rented', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'unusual', 'style', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'transparent', 'spots', 'music', 'suitable', 'first', 'tended', 'get', 'annoying', 'later', 'movie', 'very', 'strange', 'feel', 'what', 'kept', 'glued', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'start', 'work', 'out', 'fairly', 'early', 'film', 'twist', 'been', 'twisted', 'good', 'one', 'though', 'Once', 'again', 'Lionsgate', 'not', 'disappoint']","Morgue, The"

This is nothing like that.This is a very cool film. Very very weird and offbeat. It becomes super eerie and quite disturbing in the last half hour like a bad dream coming to life you can't wake up from. It disturbed me. The thought the lead actress was great too.  It is not for the slasher movie lover, but it is still it delivers.",4,Eerie,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,416,"['who', 'are', 'expecting', 'Friday', '13th', 'Halloween', 'type', 'flick', 'stay', 'away', 'nothing', 'that.This', 'very', 'cool', 'film', 'Very', 'very', 'weird', 'offbeat', 'super', 'eerie', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'bad', 'dream', 'coming', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wake', 'up', 'disturbed', 'thought', 'lead', 'actress', 'was', 'great', 'too', 'not', 'slasher', 'movie', 'lover', 'still']","Morgue, The"
1169803,A387BD735MI50R,B001B1877U,R. Schultz,"[3, 3]","The jacket on this DVD advertises an astonishing twist ending. You'll probably guess that ending from the start though. The cinematic tricks and quick replays make it fairly obvious. However, there is a slightly different take on that obvious ending that's revealed in the movie's very last sentence voice-over.On the negative side, the actors are mostly unknowns and in some instances, rightly so. The sets and production values show Morgue's amateur roots, and the narrative involves some contradictory muddle in the Morgue.On the plus side, while there is no full-length Directors' commentary on the DVD, there is a ""Making of Morgue"" featurette that shows a little of the interesting interaction between the Portuguese Directors and the American/Canadian cast and crew.Overall, this movie is worth sticking with, although it's a marginal call. But it might leave you, at least temporarily, with a greater appreciation for what you have. And that's more than most quick indie movies accomplish.",3,Don't Necessarily Bury this One,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,997,"['jacket', 'DVD', 'astonishing', 'twist', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'guess', 'ending', 'start', 'cinematic', 'tricks', 'quick', 'replays', 'make', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'However', 'slightly', 'different', 'take', 'obvious', 'ending', 'revealed', 'movie', 'very', 'last', 'sentence', 'voice-over.On', 'negative', 'side', 'actors', 'are', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'instances', 'rightly', 'so', 'sets', 'production', 'values', 'show', 'Morgue', 'amateur', 'roots', 'narrative', 'contradictory', 'muddle', 'Morgue.On', 'plus', 'side', 'full-length', 'Directors', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'Making', 'Morgue', 'featurette', 'little', 'interesting', 'interaction', 'Portuguese', 'Directors', 'American/Canadian', 'cast', 'crew.Overall', 'movie', 'worth', 'sticking', 'marginal', 'call', 'might', 'leave', 'least', 'temporarily', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'what', 'have', 'more', 'most', 'quick', 'indie', 'movies', 'accomplish']","Morgue, The"
