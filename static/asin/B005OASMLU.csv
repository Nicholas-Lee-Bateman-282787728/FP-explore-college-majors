1496216,A1Y09QLADQYQJG,B005OASMLU,&#34;T=H=E --- 'Older Than Dirt' --- Time Tra...,"[43, 45]","To get 'em all -- if you're a completist -- you get THIS set, first [if you're on a budget]... for the comedy-short two-reelers, in nopartiular viewing sequence. ANOTHER option for OUT of chronological viewing of unedited, thoroughly restored, with Leonard Maltin' intros,is the ====> $400[!!] collection:The Little Rascals: Vol 1 - 12 Cabin Fever Box Set (6 discs)If you want them IN chronological order, though NOT unedited, you could get the seven disc set:The Little Rascals: The Complete Collection.I have all three of these collections, and while the, so called, CABIN FEVER collection is the most complete unedited, restored, versions,it IS nice to see them in the order in which they were filmed. See ""Buckwheat"" as he switches from a little GIRL to a BOY!Just to SHOW you how much money YOU can save, I have the CABIN FEVER collection on VHS-cassettes; 12""LVDs; and DVDs.Then, after consumers complained that the ""Unedited"" ""Restored"" ""Complete"" Little Rascal's Collection was actually taken from Blackhawk Films'16mm prints from the '50s ad '60s... not 35mm prints... the individual DVDs were remastered from the proper films and made available.The more-complete {but NOT as good as the $400 set} versions are available, seprately IN chronological order, as:The Little Rascals Vol 1=$6Little Rascals 2..........=$7The Little Rascals Vol 3=$7The Little Rascals Vol 4=$7The Little Rascals Vol 5=$7The Little Rascals Vol 6=$7Little Rascals 7..........=$7 ... I substituted these 7 discs for the ones in the ""Complete"" Set.I hope that this has shown you that COLLECTING match-boxes is probably easier.Save your money... or SPEND it. I can certainly SEE the difference on a 55"" screen. If you have a 40 -- or less -- probably won't matter,much.Don't even get me started on the thousands of dollars I spent on THE THREE STOOGES. Now you can get EVERYTHING ""Stooges"" -- even a few extramovies AND shorts [for $50] with:The Three Stooges: The Ultimate Collection. Yes! Includes the 3-D Three Stooges Shorts from back in the '50s;in 3D or 2D.3-D Glasses are included.Enjoy!Sincerely Yours,""Big Mac""GERMANY",4,"All 88 of the pre- 6-foot tall ""Afalfa"" & ""Spanky"" bursting out of his pants, during WWII.",1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,2106,"['get', ""'re"", 'completist', 'get', 'THIS', 'set', 'first', '[', ""'re"", 'budget', ']', 'comedy-short', 'two-reelers', 'nopartiular', 'viewing', 'sequence', 'ANOTHER', 'option', 'OUT', 'chronological', 'viewing', 'unedited', 'thoroughly', 'restored', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'intros', '====', '>', '400', '[', ']', 'collection', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Vol', '1', '12', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'Box', 'Set', '6', 'discs', 'want', 'IN', 'chronological', 'order', 'NOT', 'unedited', 'could', 'get', 'seven', 'disc', 'set', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Complete', 'Collection.I', 'have', 'three', 'collections', 'so', 'called', 'CABIN', 'FEVER', 'collection', 'most', 'complete', 'unedited', 'restored', 'versions', 'nice', 'see', 'order', 'were', 'filmed', 'See', 'Buckwheat', 'little', 'GIRL', 'BOY', 'Just', 'SHOW', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'YOU', 'can', 'save', 'have', 'CABIN', 'FEVER', 'collection', 'VHS-cassettes', '12', 'LVDs', 'DVDs.Then', 'consumers', 'complained', 'Unedited', 'Restored', 'Complete', 'Little', 'Rascal', 'Collection', 'was', 'actually', 'taken', 'Blackhawk', ""Films'16mm"", 'prints', ""'50s"", 'ad', ""'60s"", 'not', '35mm', 'prints', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'were', 'remastered', 'proper', 'films', 'made', 'available.The', 'more-complete', 'NOT', 'as', 'good', '400', 'set', 'versions', 'are', 'available', 'seprately', 'IN', 'chronological', 'order', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Vol', '1=', '6Little', 'Rascals', '2', '.=', '7The', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Vol', '3=', '7The', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Vol', '4=', '7The', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Vol', '5=', '7The', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'Vol', '6=', '7Little', 'Rascals', '7', '.=', '7', 'substituted', '7', 'discs', 'ones', 'Complete', 'Set.I', 'hope', 'shown', 'COLLECTING', 'match-boxes', 'probably', 'easier.Save', 'money', 'SPEND', 'can', 'certainly', 'SEE', 'difference', '55', 'screen', 'have', '40', 'less', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much.Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'spent', 'THE', 'THREE', 'STOOGES', 'Now', 'can', 'get', 'EVERYTHING', 'Stooges', 'even', 'few', 'extramovies', 'shorts', '[', '50', ']', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Ultimate', 'Collection', 'Yes', '3-D', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Shorts', 'back', ""'50s"", '3D', '2D.3-D', 'Glasses', 'are', 'included.Enjoy', 'Sincerely', 'Big', 'Mac', 'GERMANY']",The Little Rascals Collectors Edition - 88 Classic Uncut Episodes

This DVD Collection is all the other reviewers said. Truly Uncut, and complete. All the episodes are as remembered. Some picture quality is not 100%, I'll give it a 90-95%.( I have a 60"" flat screen, the larger display seems less crisp. These are almost 70 yrs old, so I may be a bit picky.) Does not seem as clear as my Cabin Fever copies, but worth every penny spent. Funny, I did notice the order of play is almost Exactly the same as the Cabin Fever releases. ?? I will, However give the Sender/Merchant 100% plus!!! My order was placed on mid Thurs. afternoon and Bamm!! was in my mailbox Monday!! Can't get better than that! Another nice surprise was a bonus DVD that was included with this set ( Best of Abbott and Costello) sent by Lucille, the Merchant/Shipper. Was surprised to see she sent me a note to make sure all was as should be. Nice. If your a Rascals Fan this is the set to be had. If you have the chance, purchase this set, from this merchant.

I am disappointed in this set. These DVD-Rs are crammed with too many episodes per disc. The bit rate barely gets 2.2 mbps making the picture look cruddy and ruddy. This may fly on a 32"" television, but not on a big HDTV. I am even playing these on an Oppo BDP-103 and they still look bad. There is nothing wrong with my player or set and I know how old these episodes are, but this is 2013 and there are decent prints out there.

Well this set will be sold and I plan on getting the silver box set from a legit studio where the DVDs are pressed and not burned. Wish I knew the truth about this set before purchasing.

The source for those '88 episodes' must be from a very poor old VHS Tape, as the images are horrible.  I have a blu-ray player that upconverts DVD's to near Blu-Ray quality images...but here the image quality is so bad that it's impossible to view on my 42 inch HDTV...and the same is true using a small 22 inch HDTV...so BUYER BEWARE!!!  Words don't express how disappointed I was when I tried to watch these classic masterpieces where these were cheaply and poorly reproduced.  If you like large lines running through all scenes with images 'stair-stepped' so the images are at an old, outdated 'analog level' of really low resolution, then this set is for you, IF you expect and demand that a product is at least at a DVD resolution level, then this set isn't even close and you will be really, really disappointed in this bad quality collection.  Others who reviewed this same collection and gave it a 5 Star rating, are either blind or they are willing to settle for a truly inferior product.  Maybe my set was a mistake, but the seller didn't respond to my complaint so maybe the seller is the one who's making these bogus glowing reports about how great a set this is when it appears that it is trash.  I am now stuck with a really bad 'collection' that I can't return (partially because I waited several months before I opened and tried to watch this junk...and partially because the seller wouldn't respond to my U.S.P.S. letter).  I buy, watch and then donate a lot of DVD movies to my local Portland, Oregon (Multnomah County) Library Association...but this set is so bad and so unwatchable that my only option is to find a garbage outlet that will recycle this unusable product and maybe make it into something else that can be used.  This is complete junk so save yourself from throwing your money away.  There are other same/similar collections, and the one my library has is actually of decent quality...so avoid this one at all costs.",1,Great Movie Short titles...but an absolutely horrible bad collection that is unwatchable!!!,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,2163,"['bought', 'based', 'love', '34', 'Gang', '34', '34', 'Little', 'Rascals', '34', 'comedy', 'shorts', 'collection', 'have', '88', 'episodes', 'picture', 'quality', 'so', 'bad', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'source', ""'88"", 'episodes', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'poor', 'old', 'VHS', 'Tape', 'images', 'are', 'horrible', 'have', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'quality', 'images', 'here', 'image', 'quality', 'so', 'bad', 'impossible', 'view', '42', 'inch', 'HDTV', 'same', 'true', 'using', 'small', '22', 'inch', 'HDTV', 'so', 'BUYER', 'BEWARE', 'Words', 'do', ""n't"", 'express', 'how', 'disappointed', 'was', 'when', 'tried', 'watch', 'classic', 'masterpieces', 'where', 'were', 'cheaply', 'poorly', 'reproduced', 'like', 'large', 'lines', 'running', 'scenes', 'images', 'images', 'are', 'old', 'outdated', 'level', 'really', 'low', 'resolution', 'then', 'set', 'IF', 'expect', 'demand', 'product', 'least', 'DVD', 'resolution', 'level', 'then', 'set', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'will', 'be', 'really', 'really', 'disappointed', 'bad', 'quality', 'collection', 'Others', 'who', 'reviewed', 'same', 'collection', 'gave', '5', 'Star', 'rating', 'are', 'blind', 'are', 'willing', 'settle', 'truly', 'inferior', 'product', 'Maybe', 'set', 'was', 'mistake', 'seller', 'did', ""n't"", 'respond', 'complaint', 'so', 'maybe', 'seller', 'one', 'who', 'making', 'bogus', 'glowing', 'reports', 'how', 'great', 'set', 'when', 'trash', 'am', 'now', 'stuck', 'really', 'bad', ""'collection"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'return', 'partially', 'waited', 'several', 'months', 'opened', 'tried', 'watch', 'junk', 'partially', 'seller', 'would', ""n't"", 'respond', 'U.S.P.S', 'letter', 'buy', 'watch', 'then', 'donate', 'lot', 'DVD', 'movies', 'local', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'Multnomah', 'County', 'Library', 'Association', 'set', 'so', 'bad', 'so', 'unwatchable', 'only', 'option', 'find', 'garbage', 'outlet', 'will', 'recycle', 'unusable', 'product', 'maybe', 'make', 'something', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'complete', 'junk', 'so', 'save', 'throwing', 'money', 'away', 'are', 'other', 'same/similar', 'collections', 'one', 'library', 'actually', 'decent', 'quality', 'so', 'one', 'costs']",The Little Rascals Collectors Edition - 88 Classic Uncut Episodes
