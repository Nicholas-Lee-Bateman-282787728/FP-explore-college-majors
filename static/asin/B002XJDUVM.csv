1297608,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B002XJDUVM,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 2]","Based on the Playstation game, but based first (but not necessarily foremost) on the Dante classic (instead of entirely the reverse), this `Inferno' is actually closer to the book and has more actual quotations from one of the greatest pieces in Western literature than any other cinematic version I have yet seen. The GCI is impressive more than not in many scenes--even if the readings and characters sometimes come off with no more emotional appeal than a `Cartoon Network' special or a Saturday morning cartoon.  The art direction has quite a scope: from flimsy sketches to splendid panoramic interpretations of hell as we know it from the text.The circles stay close to the book, but they make Dante the Pilgrim and Poet more like a chivalrous warrior (and anatomically correct--I must add--like today's mannequins and super heroes) who must save Beatrice (who in this interpretation) has been captured by the torturous and deceptive Lucifer. (Yes, this Satan has dialogue and seems more like the evil emperor in Star Wars than the Devil we know from Dante as the eternal emperor of hell, deglamourized, crying eternally with his eyes frozen shut and his bat-like wings moving like a windmill producing an eternal lake of ice [Coccyx]).Also added to the plot are flashbacks shuffled from faux memories with grueling war scenes (undermining the crusades) to poignantly painful moments in Dante's fictitious past (reading more like a modern family fable than anything allying us to Dante Aligheri's biography).Even with the departures, the circles are depicted closer to the book and the overall interpretation is closer to Dante than any film version I've ever seen (especially 'What Dreams Must Come' and Sean Meredith's paper cut-out interpretation of Sandow Birks' [et al] novel).Inspiring, but hardly tapping into the strength of this epic poem by any measure.",3,"Close, Yet So Far..Interpretation of 'Inferno'",1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,1868,"['Based', 'Playstation', 'game', 'based', 'first', 'not', 'necessarily', 'foremost', 'Dante', 'classic', 'instead', 'entirely', 'reverse', 'Inferno', 'actually', 'closer', 'book', 'more', 'actual', 'quotations', 'one', 'greatest', 'pieces', 'Western', 'literature', 'other', 'cinematic', 'version', 'have', 'yet', 'seen', 'GCI', 'impressive', 'more', 'not', 'many', 'scenes', 'even', 'readings', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'come', 'off', 'more', 'emotional', 'appeal', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'special', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'art', 'direction', 'quite', 'scope', 'flimsy', 'sketches', 'splendid', 'panoramic', 'interpretations', 'hell', 'know', 'text.The', 'circles', 'stay', 'close', 'book', 'make', 'Pilgrim', 'Poet', 'more', 'chivalrous', 'warrior', 'anatomically', 'correct', 'must', 'add', 'today', 'mannequins', 'super', 'heroes', 'who', 'must', 'save', 'Beatrice', 'who', 'interpretation', 'been', 'captured', 'torturous', 'deceptive', 'Lucifer', 'Yes', 'Satan', 'dialogue', 'more', 'evil', 'emperor', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Devil', 'know', 'Dante', 'eternal', 'emperor', 'hell', 'deglamourized', 'crying', 'eternally', 'eyes', 'frozen', 'shut', 'bat-like', 'wings', 'moving', 'windmill', 'producing', 'eternal', 'lake', 'ice', '[', 'Coccyx', ']', '.Also', 'added', 'plot', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'shuffled', 'faux', 'memories', 'grueling', 'war', 'scenes', 'undermining', 'crusades', 'poignantly', 'painful', 'moments', 'Dante', 'fictitious', 'past', 'reading', 'more', 'modern', 'family', 'fable', 'anything', 'allying', 'Dante', 'Aligheri', 'biography', '.Even', 'departures', 'circles', 'are', 'depicted', 'closer', 'book', 'overall', 'interpretation', 'closer', 'Dante', 'film', 'version', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'especially', ""'What"", 'Dreams', 'Must', 'Come', 'Sean', 'Meredith', 'paper', 'cut-out', 'interpretation', 'Sandow', 'Birks', '[', 'al', ']', 'novel', '.Inspiring', 'hardly', 'tapping', 'strength', 'epic', 'poem', 'measure']",N/A
1297609,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B002XJDUVM,a,"[2, 3]","I am not the target audience for this DVD, but I enjoyed it nevertheless.  Having read and moderately appreciated the original 14th century epic poem in high school, I was curious how it would translate to animation, let alone animation based upon a video game.  Dante shifts from being a 35-year-old passive observer in the original to being a rugged, young, deeply sinful soldier from the Crusades.  He is given a fairly interesting back-story so that his journey into Hell starts not by happenstance but as a rescue mission to eventually prevent his brutally murdered true love from becoming queen to Satan.  I was impressed by this bold characterization of Dante and the genuine plot developments that reveal secrets along the way--with a unique twist at the conclusion.  Unlike other reviewers, I was not dismayed and angered by this re-imagining of the epic poem.  If produced as written, it would have been a fairly dull adventure.  Here, Satan is a recognizable villain seen throughout, as opposed to existing solely in the 9th Circle.  And there is definite emotion because of the love shared by Dante and Beatrice and the surprisingly complexities of their relationship.Now, that said, it is still an animated film based on a video game.  So, of course, Dante wields a mighty weapon and a sort of magic cross and rather than observing the Underworld with Virgil, he is a warrior who must slaughter his way through Hell, advancing to the next stage of the ""game.""  Thus, there is a great deal of graphic violence, plus a fair share of animated nudity.  This is not a film for children, although teenagers are clearly the target demographic (a bit disturbing).  It is also worth noting that even though this is a religious story, many Christians might be offended by certain sequences.  The cross is used in a sword fight, impaling more than one character violently through the eye, and soldiers from the Crusades are shown sexually abusing and brutally slaughtering ""heretics,"" including women and children.  Like I said, not a film for children.In the end, I really enjoyed this and I wish it was longer.  Though billed as an ""epic,"" and certainly epic in scope and design, the film runs a mere 77 minutes, plus credits, barely giving us time to appreciate the art direction of each circle.  Indeed, Dante moves through Hell so rapidly that he only spends an average of 4 to 5 minutes in each circle, usually engaged in rapid-fire combat.  Will there be a sequel?  A warrior romp through Purgatory might be interesting.  If so, at least shoot for the 90-minute mark.",4,"A violent, engaging re-imagining of the classic epic poem",1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,2576,"['am', 'not', 'target', 'audience', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'nevertheless', 'Having', 'read', 'moderately', 'appreciated', 'original', '14th', 'century', 'epic', 'poem', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'curious', 'how', 'would', 'translate', 'animation', 'let', 'alone', 'animation', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'Dante', 'shifts', 'being', '35-year-old', 'passive', 'observer', 'original', 'being', 'rugged', 'young', 'deeply', 'sinful', 'soldier', 'Crusades', 'given', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'back-story', 'journey', 'Hell', 'not', 'happenstance', 'rescue', 'mission', 'eventually', 'prevent', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'true', 'love', 'becoming', 'queen', 'Satan', 'was', 'impressed', 'bold', 'characterization', 'Dante', 'genuine', 'plot', 'developments', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'way', 'unique', 'twist', 'conclusion', 'other', 'reviewers', 'was', 'not', 'dismayed', 'angered', 're-imagining', 'epic', 'poem', 'produced', 'written', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'dull', 'adventure', 'Here', 'Satan', 'recognizable', 'villain', 'seen', 'opposed', 'existing', 'solely', '9th', 'Circle', 'definite', 'emotion', 'love', 'shared', 'Dante', 'Beatrice', 'surprisingly', 'complexities', 'relationship.Now', 'said', 'still', 'animated', 'film', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'So', 'course', 'Dante', 'mighty', 'weapon', 'sort', 'magic', 'cross', 'rather', 'observing', 'Underworld', 'Virgil', 'warrior', 'who', 'must', 'slaughter', 'way', 'Hell', 'advancing', 'next', 'stage', 'game', 'Thus', 'great', 'deal', 'graphic', 'violence', 'fair', 'share', 'animated', 'nudity', 'not', 'film', 'children', 'teenagers', 'are', 'clearly', 'target', 'demographic', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'even', 'religious', 'story', 'many', 'Christians', 'might', 'be', 'offended', 'certain', 'sequences', 'cross', 'used', 'sword', 'fight', 'impaling', 'more', 'one', 'character', 'violently', 'eye', 'soldiers', 'Crusades', 'are', 'shown', 'sexually', 'abusing', 'brutally', 'slaughtering', 'heretics', 'including', 'women', 'children', 'said', 'not', 'film', 'children.In', 'end', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'wish', 'was', 'longer', 'Though', 'billed', 'epic', 'certainly', 'epic', 'scope', 'design', 'film', 'mere', '77', 'minutes', 'credits', 'barely', 'giving', 'time', 'appreciate', 'art', 'direction', 'circle', 'Indeed', 'Dante', 'through', 'Hell', 'so', 'rapidly', 'only', 'average', '4', '5', 'minutes', 'circle', 'usually', 'engaged', 'rapid-fire', 'combat', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'sequel', 'warrior', 'romp', 'Purgatory', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'so', 'least', 'shoot', '90-minute', 'mark']",N/A

Daniel ""ComicBOOK Lover""","[2, 3]","WARNING!-IF YOU HAVE OR ARE PLANNING ON PURCHASING THE GAME AND DON'T WANT PLOT POINT RUINED, DON'T WATCH THIS FILM!!Now...let's go to HELL!Don't let the title fool you. ""Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic,"" (to be referred to as ""DI"" from here on) is a fast paced animated flick based on the game of the same name that does pretty well for adapting 8-10 hours of gameplay. Just like ""Deadspace: Downfall"" before it, Visceral/EA games has crafted an animated film to accompany their game. Using Starz Entertainment and Film Roman again, this time they took a different approach and instead of a prequel that leads to the game, we get an actual adaptation of the story presented. Albeit with some changes due to time constraints, it is very faithful to the game. This time around however the developers decided to go the anthology type route. It's still one story, but it's broken up into different art styles and has different directors a la ""The Animatrix,"" and ""Batman: Gotham Knights."" Boasting talent from such revered Asian animation studios as DongWoo (Justice League/JLU, Ultimate Avengers), JM Animation (Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Boondocks), Production I.G. (Kill Bill Vol.1, Ghost in the Shell), and Manglobe (Samurai Champloo). Film Roman did the opening segment, and it's just as good as the rest.Both the game and animation are loosely based on the first part of Dante Aligheri's ""Divine Comedy,"" and to its credit it's not a bad interpretation. The original poem follows the poet Dante with his guide, Virgil author of the Aenid, through the nine circles or levels of Hell; Limbo, Lust Gluttony, Greed, Anger Heresy, Violence, Fraud and Treachery. Throughout the journey Dante encounters famous people and acquitances that are in hell, some of which are there because of him. In the game and film, Dante is now a templar knight returning from the crusades to his beloved Beatrice, only to find her dying. With her last breath her soul leaves her body and begins its ascension to Heaven. Lucifer however, has other plans, and steals her soul and takes it to hell (Inferno as it's often referred to). What follows is the prerequisite chase and battles to free the soul of his lady love. What isn't so straight forward is how dark the story gets and how not so heroic our ""hero"" is shown to truly be. For a film based on a video game, loosely based on a classic poem, this story has some pretty deep moments for the character. If you've seen the film ""Kingdom of Heaven"" then you know just how over the top crusaders and especially the Knights Templar were. That will give you some idea of what you're in store for.The game and the film both do very good jobs at illustrating the torturous and terrifying nature of the different levels of Inferno. I'm sure it's much more detailed in the game where each level  takes almost the amount of time as the entire film, but for the glimpses we get in the film, it's truly rather disturbing in some parts. Lust, Greed, and Gluttony especially. Some of the scenery is just as described in the poem. Speaking of the poem, they lifted lines directly form it as well. Sure some of them are in the wrong places, but it still works. Also much of the religious connotations of the poem have been kept, with talk about the sins, damnation and absolution. It's all handled really well, and though it can seem heavy handed at sometimes it's not done 'just because' but usually has something to do with the story.  This is a period piece and anyone that can't deal with thick British accents and Shakespearean speech should probably skip this, but it really works and helps sets the atmosphere.The different art styles are just amazing, and though I liked some more than others, they all worked pretty well and also help set the tone of the segment. Animation is really crisp, and though I've read reviews saying Film Roman's segment wasn't up to par, I wonder if they were watching a different film as I was actually floored by it. Also there was some complaint about the different styles making it hard to keep up with who's who. Uh no, Dante has the cross sewn on his chest no matter what the style is. So you definitely know who you're looking at. The film looks good. Sounds good to. Aside from some dubbing issues with bad lipflap in segments it's got good audio, and a great score. ""DI"" is a much better effort than ""Deadspace: Downfall"" and it's pretty good as a standalone piece. I wish it had been a little longer but hey that's just because what they put out was a lot of fun to watch. Is it great? No. Is it fun? Yes. Will it make you want to play the game? Hell Yeah! If the film is any indication the game will be a blast, ""God of War"" knockoff or not. So if you enjoy action, violence, gore, a lil nudity, and can take a fair amount of religious topics, ""Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic,"" will not disappoint.",4,Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter

I can understand why animators and game producers would want to co-opt the work, its quest-like plot of a hero extricating himself from a series of levels seems ready made for this type of entertainment. The voice talent is good and devoid of a lot of the silly flourishes so often included in anime (child-like groaning and squealing by women, etc). Some of the levels are nicely conceptualized like Greed and the City of Dis. As Dante travels through the levels of hell the characters' appearances change which is an interesting break with convention. I preferred the less anime-like depictions, and some of those levels were very nicely rendered.I feared that the work would be marred somehow by inclusion of some adolescent fantasy and sure enough, Beatrice, the embodiment of purity in Dante's original, is never seen unless exposing some part of her anatomy. And the level Lust manages to combine pornography and grotesquery in a fashion that will only please the most maladjusted of teenage boys. One can only imagine why the writers would want to include such things as heads being loped off and ample streams of blood and gore.

1297617,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B002XJDUVM,Brandon J. Smith,"[1, 1]","I have no problem with the bastardization of Dante's Inferno as such. Turning the classic literary work into a rollicking adventure in which Dante tries to rescue Beatrice from Hell would be fine . . . except it's so frequently dull.Multiple animation studios worked on this, and it's clear that some are much better than others. Many of the images are compelling in and of themselves, but they're not enough to save this movie. In the end, you've got to have a better story. They would have done well to stick more closely to the real Inferno's tale.I find myself wondering who this would appeal to.

Even though some crazy things happen, and I don't want to give spoilers, the plot makes sense and follows basic ideas from the Divine Comedy. Certainly this will enhance interest in Dante's classic, one of the great works of world literature.  The movie made me think about the literary concepts of Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso.The punishment for each sin is a contrapasso in Inferno.

1297620,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002XJDUVM,C. Sawin,"[0, 0]","A commercial for the Dante's Inferno video game aired during the Super Bowl earlier this year, which gave viewers the impression that the game would be incredibly reminiscent of games like Devil May Cry and God of War. Although I never played the game, Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic was sent to me by the Amazon Vine program. My expectations weren't very high and that seemed to pay off in the long run. The animated feature takes the Batman: Gotham Knight approach where six different animation directors take hold of the film, but Dante's Inferno tells one semi-coherent story. The film surely has no issue with showing graphic violence, gore, or nudity as there rarely isn't a moment in the 77 minute feature where buckets of blood aren't falling from the sky or where Dante's beloved Beatrice isn't exposing her rather well endowed set of breasts. The changes in animation seemed rather infrequent and drastic at times while at others it felt a bit more natural. The voice acting is pretty top notch as the film utilizes voice actor veterans such as Mark Hamill, Steve Blum, and Kevin Michael Richardson. Dante's descent through the nine circles of hell was unintentionally humorous at times though. The main example being when he's fighting off and fleeing from the army of dead babies in Limbo. Also, his father accepting Lucifer's offer to work for him in exchange for all the gold he desired and the slaying of his mortal son wasn't surprising, but the fact that his mouth now looked like a vagina was. Certain things just didn't add up at times. In the end, Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic isn't terrible but isn't fantastic either. It's not worth hunting down specifically, but is worth sitting through on a rainy day afternoon or something.The only special features included on the DVD are the EA game trailer and animatics for five scenes in the film.",3,Slightly better than expected.,1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,1869,"['commercial', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'video', 'game', 'aired', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'earlier', 'year', 'gave', 'viewers', 'impression', 'game', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'reminiscent', 'games', 'Devil', 'May', 'Cry', 'God', 'War', 'never', 'played', 'game', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'Animated', 'Epic', 'was', 'sent', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'program', 'expectations', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'high', 'seemed', 'pay', 'off', 'long', 'run', 'animated', 'feature', 'Batman', 'Gotham', 'Knight', 'approach', 'where', 'six', 'different', 'animation', 'directors', 'take', 'hold', 'film', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'one', 'semi-coherent', 'story', 'film', 'surely', 'issue', 'showing', 'graphic', 'violence', 'gore', 'nudity', 'rarely', ""n't"", 'moment', '77', 'minute', 'feature', 'where', 'buckets', 'blood', 'are', ""n't"", 'falling', 'sky', 'where', 'Dante', 'beloved', 'Beatrice', ""n't"", 'exposing', 'rather', 'well', 'endowed', 'set', 'breasts', 'changes', 'animation', 'seemed', 'rather', 'infrequent', 'drastic', 'times', 'others', 'felt', 'bit', 'more', 'natural', 'voice', 'acting', 'pretty', 'top', 'notch', 'film', 'utilizes', 'voice', 'actor', 'veterans', 'such', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Steve', 'Blum', 'Kevin', 'Michael', 'Richardson', 'Dante', 'descent', 'nine', 'circles', 'hell', 'was', 'unintentionally', 'humorous', 'times', 'though', 'main', 'example', 'being', 'when', 'fighting', 'off', 'fleeing', 'army', 'dead', 'babies', 'Limbo', 'Also', 'father', 'accepting', 'Lucifer', 'offer', 'work', 'exchange', 'gold', 'desired', 'slaying', 'mortal', 'son', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'fact', 'mouth', 'now', 'looked', 'vagina', 'was', 'Certain', 'things', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'times', 'end', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'Animated', 'Epic', ""n't"", 'terrible', ""n't"", 'fantastic', 'either', 'not', 'worth', 'hunting', 'down', 'specifically', 'worth', 'sitting', 'rainy', 'day', 'afternoon', 'something.The', 'only', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'EA', 'game', 'trailer', 'animatics', 'five', 'scenes', 'film']",N/A

This animation is based loosely on Dante's Inferno, from the fourteenth-century epic poem Divine Comedy. Everything described in that novel, all the levels of hell and who or what you can find there, are in this animation. However, the characters are changed slightly. I will try not to spoil it too much, especially for those who haven't watched it yet. This animated epic also accompanies a PS3 game of the same name which is due out any day now.The Crusader knight Dante, returns from the Crusades only to find his beloved Beatrice murdered. The reason for her murder is later explained in the course of the story. As her soul ascends to Heaven, it is captured by Lucifer and dragged to Hell, and Dante gives chase. This story basically uncovers the history of Dante's Holy Crusade and what damning deeds he did and how he broke his promise and gave into temptation. It is a story of forgiveness and redemption not just for himself but for certain people who were close to Dante. At the same time, it also tries to teach us that even the purest soul can be corrupted, after being subjected to manipulation by the devil, where he twists and turns the truths and lies, to break you down and make you believe his version of the truth.I must say I enjoyed the animation thoroughly, there were 3 different animators throughout the entire movie. And each of them did a fantastic job of depicting the damned, the evil and the emotional state of the characters. The first animator used sad and proper tone and lines in the art, probably showing Dante's unbreakable will and righteousness cause. The second had a lot of abstract looks to the characters, probably depicting how they characters were twisted. The later animator brought out a lot of bright colors, probably to show Dante, as he found clarity, redemption and forgiveness in his search for his love.Blood, murder, butchery, death, gore and much more are the main themes in the story, and why not, they were animating a story about Hell. I think the highlight of the story for me was when Dante found Crusaders in Hell and he questioned it, believing that the Crusaders cause was holy and that they were absolved of sin, and the dead crusaders spat out was that ""The Priest lied!"", probably telling him that this Crusade was all for nothing to begin with and in another life, they didn't have to die. Although some of the characters found closure, the story finished off in an open-ended manner, which wasn't clearly explained.I highly recommend this animation epic to everyone, especially those who enjoyed animations (or anime) like Animatrix and Akira.

I have been thinking about getting him Dante's Inferno, so the companion movie seemed like a good treat. Instead it was 88 minutes of our lives that I will never get back. There are many reasons that I disliked this movie, but I will highlight the worst offenders.#1: There are 6 different directors and 6 different animation styles. Instead of having this be artsy, or fun you are left with a visual jumble that makes the movie hard to follow. Main characters have their faces and haircolor changed at random, as styles switch. You have to take a minute and look at the new image and think... ""Oh yeah, that must be Beatrice's brother."" If the studios had just agreed on some basic elements (How the characters clothes were, hair color, hair style) it would have made for a better viewing experience.#2: Most of the characters are unlikeable, including Dante! I can't give too much away here, without causing major spoiler issues. Basically, the movie starts out with Dante coming home from the crusades. Throughout the movie, there are flashes that explain what happened while he was in Jersualem. By the end of the movie both my husband and I really disliked Dante and did not care what happened to him. It spoils the movie.#3: Cop out endings are no fun: The ending of this movie was a total cop out, that didn't really end or explain anything, so then you really do feel that you wasted your time.All in all, there are many other good movies out there based on video games.

Putting aside the commercial underpinnings, viewing this video as a stand-alone variation of Alighieri's literary classic it comes across as a well produced tale that has made some modifications on the original storyline, probably to fit in with the plot of the computer game. Dante, in the animated film, comes across as a sympathetic character with very human failings, though it seems he is characterized with far greater anger and depths of personal inner sin than the original story details and engages in mortal combat with many of the beasts of hell as he seeks to free the wrongly captured soul of his beloved fiancee being held in the lowest circle of Hell. During his journey he also encounters both of his parents, one confronting him in the form of a demon, the other as an imprisoned and suffering soul.The animation is excellent, very fluid and spectacular with well choreographed battles and detailed images of the suffering the damned souls must endure and clings fairly close to the details of Dante Alighieri's original concept , at least in the construction of Hell itself.

1297656,A2VPRTKCL22TCH,B002XJDUVM,"Q. Pair ""Shaman""","[5, 6]","I think the word ""Epic"" is most definitely the right word to sum up this new take on Dante Alighieri's divine comedy. Having read the literary work, I was very interested to see how the nine circles would be visually presented, given the development of and adaptation of contemporary styles of animation, as well as the more accepted liberal views on religion of the present day; not to mention that the period in history in which the original story was constructed, the Catholic Church's view on life, heaven and hell were absolute. The combination of all those things had the potential for being something truely unique and inspiring. The final product, I'm pleased to say, turned out to be one heck of a thrill to watch.Right on the heels of the newly released video game of the same name (concept and all) Dante's Inferno was an excellent piece of work. For those unfamiliar with the story, the plot breakdown is as follows:Dante, a soldier who took part in the Crusade, comes home from war to find everyone in his father's villa home slaughtered, including his beloved fiance, Beatrice. As Beatrice breaths her last breath and Dante witnesses her soul ascending into Heaven, she is snatched up by Lucifer and dragged to hell. In an effort to free Beatrice from the depths of hell Dante dives head first into the Inferno, with the poet Virgil as his guide, fighting off demons, monsters, illusions, damned souls, and his own dark memories that plague him.Now, given that this is basically an animated version of the game, you pretty much know what to expect: lots of blood and gore. If anything else is prevelant in this movie, its the blood. Dante goes into the Inferno swinging, hacking, slashing and chopping up anything in his path. Literally. So this isnt for the kiddies, or the soft of heart and stomach. However, just because this is a huge gore fest doesnt take away from how awsome this movie is.Story: 5/5The story is an awesome one to tell, albeit its been changed around a bit for cinematic enjoyment, but its a great action flick. There is a nice balance of action, drama, and suspense, and its ultimately a satisfying view.Animation: 4/5Since this IS an animated feature, the art does come into question. This part is kind of tricky to judge. The movie is primarily Japanese Anime style, which is great. Whats interesting is that the styles switch up as the film progresses. I'm not sure, but I think for ever couple of circles of Hell that are traversed, everything gets changed to a new style. This is a very interesting choice of presentation, and adds even more to the impressiveness of the movie, but it can a bit off putting, cuz as soon as your used to a new style and like it, it changes suddenly and you have to start over again. Its a minor annoyance, but still kinda cool. Also, the concepts for the characters of hell are amazing, and so very dark. Some of the levels are downright creepy. I haven't played the game, so I don't know how much influence comes from it, but everything in the inferno was beautifully envisioned.... well, as beautiful as one's vision of Hell can be anyway. In all, I think there are about 5, maybe 6 styles in the movie. Oh, and this looks GREAT on blu-ray on an HDTV.Sound/Music: 4/5Usually I'm a big critic of movie scores, but this time I let it slide. You dont really expect too much from the score here because your so into the action, there's really no room for anything fancy. Its ok, but nothing that would stand alone if you were to buy the score itself. Sound quality was pretty good, and it better be since this is a blue ray release. The voice acting was pretty good with a few voices you will immediately catch on to (Mark Hamill, for example). Some were better then others, but it gets the job done.Replay Value: 4/5This is a fun flick, good for people who like hack n slash, action packed type animes. Good for an occasional view, and even better for the artistic value packed into it.Overall, I give Dante's Inferno: and Animated Epic a 4.5/5. If not for those minor gripes of mine, it would be flawless, but then again, not everyone is going to like everything. Either way, I still put out my money for it. Its a great movie, worth the price of money and time. Enjoy! I'm going to go watch it again.",5,Your Gonna Need Some Sunblock In The Inferno,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,4276,"['think', 'word', 'Epic', 'most', 'definitely', 'right', 'word', 'sum', 'up', 'new', 'take', 'Dante', 'Alighieri', 'divine', 'comedy', 'Having', 'read', 'literary', 'work', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'nine', 'circles', 'would', 'be', 'visually', 'presented', 'given', 'development', 'adaptation', 'contemporary', 'styles', 'animation', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'accepted', 'liberal', 'views', 'religion', 'present', 'day', 'not', 'mention', 'period', 'history', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'constructed', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'view', 'life', 'heaven', 'hell', 'were', 'absolute', 'combination', 'things', 'had', 'potential', 'being', 'something', 'truely', 'unique', 'inspiring', 'final', 'product', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'heck', 'thrill', 'watch.Right', 'heels', 'newly', 'released', 'video', 'game', 'same', 'name', 'concept', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'was', 'excellent', 'piece', 'work', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'plot', 'breakdown', 'Dante', 'soldier', 'who', 'took', 'part', 'Crusade', 'home', 'war', 'find', 'everyone', 'father', 'villa', 'home', 'slaughtered', 'including', 'beloved', 'fiance', 'Beatrice', 'Beatrice', 'breaths', 'last', 'breath', 'Dante', 'soul', 'ascending', 'Heaven', 'snatched', 'up', 'Lucifer', 'dragged', 'hell', 'effort', 'free', 'Beatrice', 'depths', 'hell', 'Dante', 'head', 'first', 'Inferno', 'poet', 'Virgil', 'guide', 'fighting', 'off', 'demons', 'monsters', 'illusions', 'damned', 'souls', 'own', 'dark', 'memories', 'plague', 'him.Now', 'given', 'basically', 'animated', 'version', 'game', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'lots', 'blood', 'gore', 'anything', 'else', 'prevelant', 'movie', 'blood', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'swinging', 'hacking', 'slashing', 'chopping', 'up', 'anything', 'path', 'Literally', 'So', 'isnt', 'kiddies', 'soft', 'heart', 'stomach', 'However', 'just', 'huge', 'gore', 'fest', 'doesnt', 'take', 'away', 'how', 'awsome', 'movie', 'is.Story', '5/5The', 'story', 'awesome', 'one', 'tell', 'albeit', 'been', 'changed', 'bit', 'cinematic', 'enjoyment', 'great', 'action', 'flick', 'nice', 'balance', 'action', 'drama', 'suspense', 'ultimately', 'satisfying', 'view.Animation', '4/5Since', 'animated', 'feature', 'art', 'come', 'question', 'part', 'kind', 'tricky', 'judge', 'movie', 'primarily', 'Japanese', 'Anime', 'style', 'great', 'Whats', 'interesting', 'styles', 'switch', 'up', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'think', 'ever', 'couple', 'circles', 'Hell', 'are', 'traversed', 'everything', 'changed', 'new', 'style', 'very', 'interesting', 'choice', 'presentation', 'even', 'more', 'impressiveness', 'movie', 'can', 'bit', 'putting', 'cuz', 'as', 'soon', 'used', 'new', 'style', 'suddenly', 'have', 'start', 'over', 'again', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'still', 'kinda', 'cool', 'Also', 'concepts', 'characters', 'hell', 'are', 'amazing', 'so', 'very', 'dark', 'levels', 'are', 'downright', 'creepy', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'game', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'influence', 'everything', 'inferno', 'was', 'beautifully', 'envisioned', 'well', 'as', 'beautiful', 'one', 'vision', 'Hell', 'can', 'be', 'anyway', 'think', 'are', '5', 'maybe', '6', 'styles', 'movie', 'Oh', 'GREAT', 'blu-ray', 'HDTV.Sound/Music', '4/5Usually', ""'m"", 'big', 'critic', 'movie', 'scores', 'time', 'let', 'slide', 'dont', 'really', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'score', 'here', 'so', 'action', 'really', 'room', 'anything', 'fancy', 'ok', 'nothing', 'would', 'stand', 'alone', 'were', 'buy', 'score', 'Sound', 'quality', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'better', 'be', 'blue', 'ray', 'release', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'few', 'voices', 'will', 'immediately', 'catch', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'example', 'were', 'better', 'then', 'others', 'job', 'done.Replay', 'Value', '4/5This', 'fun', 'flick', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'hack', 'n', 'slash', 'action', 'packed', 'type', 'animes', 'Good', 'occasional', 'view', 'even', 'better', 'artistic', 'value', 'packed', 'it.Overall', 'give', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'Animated', 'Epic', '4.5/5', 'not', 'minor', 'gripes', 'mine', 'would', 'be', 'flawless', 'then', 'again', 'not', 'everyone', 'going', 'like', 'everything', 'way', 'still', 'put', 'out', 'money', 'great', 'movie', 'price', 'money', 'time', 'Enjoy', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

How good could it possibly be?But I took a chance.  Unlike some (I'm looking at you, Mr. Ebert), I acknowledge that video games can be post-modern works of art in their own way.  And it's undeniable that the video game industry is grabbing some of the most creative minds in America and overseas.  I try to read Dante every couple of years, so I figured what the hell, I'd give it a shot.What a goof.  The movie starts promisingly enough, with Dante as a soldier returning home from the Crusades.  He comes home to find his family murdered and his beloved, gorgeous Beatrice dying of a gruesome stab wound. But Dante's horrors don't end there - soon Lucifer himself has snatched Beatrice's heaven-bound spirit and claimed it for his own.  Dante follows Lucifer to hell in an attempt to free his beloved's virtuous soul.That doesn't sound half-bad for a set-up.  But the movie then devolves into an interminable series of scenes where Dante moves from one circle of hell to another, screams ""Beatrice, no!"" and kills the nasties he finds there.  He frees a couple of souls he recognizes, although how Dante is empowered to do this nobody explains, and he's rather churlish in that he doesn't just free everyone and have done with it.  He also slays some demi-Lucifers who have been in hell for thousands of years, thereby raising lots of metaphysical questions that the movie doesn't pretend to answer, as in, how can you kill Minos, the judge of the dead, if he's already dead and in hell?This might be one fantastic game, but the repeated fighting gets dull quickly.  Dante loses his sword and fights with a bizarre bone-scythe that he instantly masters even though the proportions are all wrong.  Seemingly every opponent in hell can be defeated the same way - I think the Church would be well-served if it would hire some Blackwater mercenaries and send them downstairs armed with the latest in modern armaments - hell could be toppled before lunch.There are a couple of scenes where Dante confronts his own sins, but there is nothing in this movie that qualifies as real dramatic development.  Instead, the movie is essentially a bunch of cut-scenes from the video game - this is what would happen if you were to play it.  The violence is flamboyant and bloody, but since you are watching it rather than causing it as a player, it gets tedious quickly.Parts of the movie look great - hell is given some quite diverting circles and some nasty denizens to boot.

1297664,AUV0EFKWA46TX,B002XJDUVM,shaxper,"[0, 0]","Going into this film, I felt that it already had two strikes against it.  It was an extended video game commercial, and it clearly had very little to do with the real Dante andThe Divine Comedy.  Amazingly enough, though, the film was still able to win me over with stunning, textured animation (NOT computer generated), fantastic voice talents, and a story and main character that both become surprisingly rich as the story moves forward.  I found it incredibly rewarding to watch a simple, two-dimensional hero come face to face with the accidental sins he'd been party to throughout his life and seek redemption and extreme self-sacrifice in the process.  It's exciting, shocking, and incredibly thoughtful -- much more than a shameless video game tie-in.  It also exhibits a decent understanding of Hell as Dante portrayed it, even though the plot is entirely original.All in all, this is a first rate effort, and it's the kind of anime classic that I'd be proud to put on the shelf next toAkiraandGhost in the Shell, but I must warn parents that this is definitely not a film for kids and adolescents to watch.  Sex and nudity are excessive throughout, whether in portraying half naked corpses, naked lovers praying, or demon temptresses with highly detailed (and weaponized) genitalia.

1297665,A1TR9417Z4U72F,B002XJDUVM,"S. M. Robare ""smurfwreck""","[6, 12]","Wow, where to start.  Considering that the cartoon is based on the EA video game, I didn't go into the viewing expecting a strict adherence to the initial influence, Dante Alighieri's 14th century epic poem Inferno, but I was sort of hoping for the general story to crop into the plot.  I suppose in a way it does, at least in the barest conceptual terms.  Reading the back of the case I saw that the story follows a character named Dante, a knight back from the crusades, who follows his betrothed, Beatrice, to hell after she is murdered and her soul claimed by Satan (based on a deal she made to bring Dante home safe from his battles.)  In hell Dante happens upon a guide, Virgil, who helps him descend through the nine levels of hell in order to win back the soul of his beloved Beatrice.  Okay, so even though the story takes some liberties with the source, it doesn't seem to terribly stray, at least I didn't think so until I stuck the DVD in and hit play.Again, Wow.  Adaptation is rarely faithful, but the Dante's Inferno cartoon is about as far a stretch as can be mustered without just cribbing the title.  Again, considering that the original poem was used to form the familiar framework for an action based video game, I can totally see past this, but it's no excuse for how base and pedestrian the final story was handled.  The writers and artists of this cartoon anthology (as well as those who designed the core story elements from the game) have managed to put together a disjointed and boring escapade though hell in which the main character is almost impossible to get behind.  The action and violence is borderline stupid, and represents the mentality of an angry twelve year-old boy.  In his initial decent into hell, Dante and Virgil board a ferry (a variation of Charon, in which he IS the ferry itself) to cross the river Acheron, much like in the poem.  When Charon disgustingly orders Dante off because he is a mortal, Dante defies him, first battling a horde of winged demons, and then murdering Charon (who is a boat and a concept mind you), piercing his giant head with his newfound demon blade and then forcing the ferry to impale itself on the jagged rocky shores on the far side of the river Acheron.  We're treated to a repeat of this process as Dante makes his way through the various circles of hell, battling with the ""gate keepers"" (Cerberus who guards the 3rd level of Gluttens, a series of sirens in the second level Lust, etc.), and again, dispatching all who cross his path.  So Dante in the cartoon, instead of taking a life-changing introspective journey through the bowls of hell, is dismantling it level by level.  You can totally see the video game mechanics working themselves out on screen.The flick is animated by a series of different directors and artists much in the stylistic vein of films like theThe AnimatrixandBatman Gotham Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition)cartoons.  Unlike those films though, Dante's Inferno isn't comprised of disparate short stories, but instead is one continuous narrative.  Because the artistic style changes drastically in the hand-offs from one animation house to the next, the flow if the film becomes completely disrupted and awkward.  Dante's character design changes a lot from one interpretation to the next, going from a short-haired well built guy to a long-haired thin man.  Similarly the poet Virgil shifts between a wraith-like svelt goth to a stocky literally wooden figure.  The animation itself is mostly well-done, though there is an overabundance of CG camera movements that give the flick a very cheap visual feel.All in all I think this cartoon is an utter waste of time.  Faithfulness to the original poem aside, the cartoon feels like watching a video game, which is pretty much only fun when you're actually playing the game.  The violence and gore is insanely stupid with only a few glimpses of creativity (the sirens in the level of Lust are quite disturbing), and I'm not even bashing the fact that it's present, it's just dumb.  The film reeks of being deeper and more interesting than it really is, making up for this with endless disturbing imagery that's so constantly in-your-face that it makes for a numb viewing experience.  Before wasting your time on this, I'd recommend watchingHellraiserfirst for a much more interesting take on hellish (literally) action and suspense, and to see how disturbing imagery and concepts can be worked into a much more satisfying story.",1,A boring trip through a 12 year-old's vision of hell...,1269907200,"03 30, 2010",2010,4482,"['Wow', 'where', 'start', 'Considering', 'cartoon', 'based', 'EA', 'video', 'game', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'viewing', 'expecting', 'strict', 'adherence', 'initial', 'influence', 'Dante', 'Alighieri', '14th', 'century', 'epic', 'poem', 'Inferno', 'was', 'sort', 'hoping', 'general', 'story', 'crop', 'plot', 'suppose', 'way', 'least', 'barest', 'conceptual', 'terms', 'Reading', 'back', 'case', 'saw', 'story', 'character', 'named', 'Dante', 'knight', 'back', 'crusades', 'who', 'betrothed', 'Beatrice', 'hell', 'murdered', 'soul', 'claimed', 'Satan', 'based', 'deal', 'made', 'bring', 'Dante', 'home', 'safe', 'battles', 'hell', 'Dante', 'guide', 'Virgil', 'who', 'descend', 'nine', 'levels', 'hell', 'order', 'win', 'back', 'soul', 'beloved', 'Beatrice', 'Okay', 'so', 'even', 'story', 'liberties', 'source', ""n't"", 'seem', 'terribly', 'stray', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'stuck', 'DVD', 'hit', 'play.Again', 'Wow', 'Adaptation', 'rarely', 'faithful', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'cartoon', 'far', 'stretch', 'can', 'be', 'mustered', 'just', 'cribbing', 'title', 'Again', 'considering', 'original', 'poem', 'was', 'used', 'form', 'familiar', 'framework', 'action', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'can', 'totally', 'see', 'excuse', 'how', 'base', 'pedestrian', 'final', 'story', 'was', 'handled', 'writers', 'artists', 'cartoon', 'anthology', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'designed', 'core', 'story', 'elements', 'game', 'have', 'managed', 'put', 'together', 'disjointed', 'boring', 'escapade', 'hell', 'main', 'character', 'almost', 'impossible', 'get', 'behind', 'action', 'violence', 'borderline', 'stupid', 'mentality', 'angry', 'twelve', 'year-old', 'boy', 'initial', 'decent', 'hell', 'Dante', 'Virgil', 'board', 'ferry', 'variation', 'Charon', 'ferry', 'cross', 'river', 'Acheron', 'much', 'poem', 'When', 'Charon', 'disgustingly', 'orders', 'Dante', 'off', 'mortal', 'Dante', 'first', 'battling', 'horde', 'winged', 'demons', 'then', 'murdering', 'Charon', 'who', 'boat', 'concept', 'mind', 'piercing', 'giant', 'head', 'newfound', 'demon', 'blade', 'then', 'forcing', 'ferry', 'impale', 'jagged', 'rocky', 'shores', 'far', 'side', 'river', 'Acheron', ""'re"", 'treated', 'repeat', 'process', 'Dante', 'way', 'various', 'circles', 'hell', 'battling', 'gate', 'keepers', 'Cerberus', 'who', 'guards', '3rd', 'level', 'Gluttens', 'series', 'sirens', 'second', 'level', 'Lust', 'etc', 'again', 'dispatching', 'who', 'cross', 'path', 'So', 'Dante', 'cartoon', 'instead', 'taking', 'life-changing', 'introspective', 'journey', 'bowls', 'hell', 'dismantling', 'level', 'level', 'can', 'totally', 'see', 'video', 'game', 'mechanics', 'working', 'out', 'screen.The', 'flick', 'animated', 'series', 'different', 'directors', 'artists', 'much', 'stylistic', 'vein', 'films', 'theThe', 'AnimatrixandBatman', 'Gotham', 'Knight', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'cartoons', 'films', 'Dante', 'Inferno', ""n't"", 'comprised', 'disparate', 'short', 'stories', 'instead', 'one', 'continuous', 'narrative', 'artistic', 'style', 'changes', 'drastically', 'hand-offs', 'one', 'animation', 'house', 'next', 'flow', 'film', 'completely', 'disrupted', 'awkward', 'Dante', 'character', 'design', 'lot', 'one', 'interpretation', 'next', 'going', 'short-haired', 'well', 'built', 'guy', 'long-haired', 'thin', 'man', 'Similarly', 'poet', 'Virgil', 'shifts', 'wraith-like', 'svelt', 'goth', 'stocky', 'literally', 'wooden', 'figure', 'animation', 'mostly', 'well-done', 'overabundance', 'CG', 'camera', 'movements', 'give', 'flick', 'very', 'cheap', 'visual', 'feel.All', 'think', 'cartoon', 'utter', 'waste', 'time', 'Faithfulness', 'original', 'poem', 'aside', 'cartoon', 'feels', 'watching', 'video', 'game', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'fun', 'when', ""'re"", 'actually', 'playing', 'game', 'violence', 'gore', 'insanely', 'stupid', 'only', 'few', 'glimpses', 'creativity', 'sirens', 'level', 'Lust', 'are', 'quite', 'disturbing', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'bashing', 'fact', 'present', 'just', 'dumb', 'film', 'reeks', 'being', 'deeper', 'more', 'interesting', 'really', 'making', 'up', 'endless', 'disturbing', 'imagery', 'so', 'constantly', 'in-your-face', 'numb', 'viewing', 'experience', 'wasting', 'time', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watchingHellraiserfirst', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'take', 'hellish', 'literally', 'action', 'suspense', 'see', 'how', 'disturbing', 'imagery', 'concepts', 'can', 'be', 'worked', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'story']",N/A

Adlam ""professional consumer""","[35, 37]","There are a couple things you should know before deciding to view this movie: 1) Instead of ""Dante's Inferno"" a more fitting title would be ""A Gentle Nod in the General Direction of Dante's Inferno""; and 2) It's explicit. And by ""explicit"" I mean there is brazen nudity, unapologetic violence with gushing blood, and man-eating genitalia (I kid you not).If you're still with me, that means you're open to experiencing an interesting, gory, and twisted animated tale about a soldier on a quest through the nine circles of Hell to rescue the love of his life. Dante, having returned home from fighting God's war, finds everyone he knew--including his love Beatrice--slaughtered. He then watches her soul snatched into the jaws of Hell after she (apparently) made a deal with the Devil and lost (through no fault of her own). Thus begins the quest. Along the way, Dante meets his guide, Virgil, and learns the fate of (and is attacked by) all the sinners writhing in agony--absolving a few along the way.Having read The Divine Comedy a couple of times (The Inferno about five), it was difficult getting past the *liberties* taken with the overall story, but I could see why they were taken--watching a frightened middle-aged poet sojourning through the underworld with an old ghost and chit-chatting with various dead people wouldn't be nearly as entertaining as a hot young warrior lopping off heads every few minutes and being chased by lustful women with carnivorous nether-regions.The animation is beautiful and done well, Anime with Western influences, if a bit inconsistent since there were six directors with six different styles. My main complaint however comes with the pacing and dialog. Scenes went by too fast and barely allowed time for the character to absorb the words being spoken much less the viewer and the delivery of the dialog was too often overly dramatic--think William Shatner (circa original Star Trek) saying, ""O Beatrice! Beloved Beatrice! I shall traverse the depths of Hell to rescue you. O my love, Beatrice!"" That aside, the story flowed and, for the most part, made sense.As for the DVD itself, the menu is a bit difficult to decipher, but not a deal-breaker. The bonus materials include sketches of various scenes from the movie--a nice touch for people who are interested in art or animation--and the trailer for the video game. (As an aside: I have to admit, the game looks awesome. I kind of wish the movie was made in the 3D style of the video game, but I'm not too upset about it.)",3,A Slight Nod in Dante's Direction...

1297668,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B002XJDUVM,Tim Janson,"[6, 7]","Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic is based on the recent video game from EA and Visceral games.  Dante Alighieri is a knight who has returned home from the Holy Crusades to find his father and wife murdered.  As his wife's soul floats to Heaven, it is intercepted by Lucifer, who drags her down to Hell.  Dante must follow down into the depths of the netherworld, battling through the nine circles of Hell to rescue his beloved Beatrice.The film follows the path of the game closely...perhaps too closely.  While it's fun to battle through the legions of Hell, fighting monstrous boss characters and absolving heretics of their sins, watching it isn't quite so fun.  As in the game, Dante is aided by the spirit of Roman poet Virgil who guides him on his journey, which basically consists of one battle after another, some sage advice from Virgil, and Lucifer taunting Dante.The film is told in segments with each representing a circle of Hell.  In all, there are five different animation studios who worked on the film including Dong Woo Animation (Justice League Unlimited), Studio Manglobe (Samurai Champloo), Film Roman (Hellboy Animated), JM Animation, and Production I.G.  With so many different styles and Directors, the film suffers from a lack of consistency both in terms of animation style and characterization.  Some segments have a strong Anime look to them which doesn't work well with the Gothic/Medieval setting of the film.  Dante himself looks decidedly different in the various styles, appearing alternatively has a hulking knight to a lithe martial artist.The film failed to improve on the thick-witted personality Dante shows in the game.  He has little to say outside of shouting, ""Where's Beatrice!""  Or ""I must save Beatrice!""  Game fans may (or may not) be happy that Circle Two's giant boss Cleopatra who pulled demonic babies from naked breasts is nowhere to be seen.  Most of the other bosses of the game are present including Charon, Cerebrus, King Minos, and Dante's own father.  The film maintains the game's theme of sin and redemption but like the game the end is left far too wide open.  The game we can understand as a sequel will surely be forthcoming.  For the film, the ending is unforgivable.If you enjoyed the videogame you're likely to enjoy the film, if for no other reason than to see the story brought to life.

That is the point; it's a companion to the videogame. And of COURSE, it isn't ""faithful to the original"" it's not supposed to be. It is based on the original & has just the right amount of Dante. And the ending is what we call ""setting up the sequel"" when we who watch movies talk amongst ourselves.The animation is beautiful--over the top in the blood department, but nicely done...in the vein of ""Vampire Hunter D"" or ""Ghost in a Shell"" (not surprising since this comes from some of the same people). The slightly different animation styles ot the sections of the film flow into each other. I liked some more than others, but all were interesting. I loved Shuko Murase's ""Witch Hunter Robin"" series. And I respect the other works of the several other directors and animators who worked on the project (well, Mike Disa did help to inflict ""Eight Crazy Nights"" on the world...but we can forgive him that).I probably would have given this three stars, maybe two and a half (were it not for the overabundance of unfairly low star-scores) because it's just not my cup of tea.

I did think about getting the game & the trailer on this DVD looks breath-taking...but I decided to pass on the game.In short (too late!) this is worth your time if you are a fan of the people involved or the videogame or are just looking for an evening's entertainment and don't mind a bit of Christian mythology (among others) thrown in.

I laughed here and there when it came to some of the things I saw, knowing that some of the fights would be nice and horrible and tragic if you think about it.That's the beauty of things like thins and the beauty of touring hell: when you stare into the abyss long enough, you might see granny or some other family memebr (wait, that's not how it goes!)A lot of people did not like it because of a few reasons, but I thought it had all I needed here.

1297673,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B002XJDUVM,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","Dante Alighieri's DIVINE COMEDY, and more specifically THE INFERNO, has had a tremendous influence upon our culture.  It's been over a decade since I read this poem, but when I heard that there was a video game coming out that was based on THE INFERNO it really intrigued me. It wasn't so much the game itself, but the idea of what the main storyline would be in the game.  Since I don't have a PS3 or an XBOX 360, I was able to get an idea of what the story the game-developers created by watching the DVD based upon the game.So, DANTE'S INFERNO is an animated movie conceived by six different directors that is based upon a video game that is loosely based upon a Middle Age Italian poem.  Get that?The movie revolves around Dante Aligheiri.  In this version of the story he's apparently the son of an English lord gone off to the Crusades to fight for King Richard and win Jerusalem back from the Muslims.  In flashback seen during key points during Dante's journey it's revealed that Dante was involved in some very horrible acts while in the Holy Land.  He returns home to find his family and his beloved Beatrice, to whom he is betrothed, murdered.  As Beatrice, a supposedly pure soul, begins to rise toward Heaven, she is snatched by Satan and taken to Hell.  A gateway is left open and Dante, though a living mortal, follows in pursuit.  Beatrice is taken deep into Hell because Satan intends to make her his bride.  He taunts Dante with the assumption that he can save Beatrice, but only if he's able to make it through the nine levels of Hell alive.  Dante seems to want nothing more than to be with Beatrice again and with the help of Virgil, who serves as his spirit guide that explains to him the tortures of each level, some of the famous people there, and what he must do to open the door to the next level, he begins fighting his way through the nine planes of Hell.  In addition to fighting of Hell's minions, Dante has a cross that contains a real artifact (a thorn from the crown of Christ, I believe) that Dante can use to save any souls he feels don't deserve to be in Hell.Just like the poem, DANTE'S INFERNO is incredible violent and graphic. There are babies crawling around on four legs with giant scissor appendages, women with genitalia that can both eat a person or pierce them through the heart, zombie desert warriors, as well as numerous harpies and demons.  Appendages get slashed and gore gushes out.  At one point in the movie there are literally rivers of blood.  Oh, and there's also nudity.  There's lots and lots of nudity; numerous full frontal females and every once in awhile a full frontal male.  Oh, and there's lots of cursing, too. I don't recall the ""f-bomb"" being spoken, but there are lots and lots of damns and when Dante damns something he really means it.  I've played the first two GOD OF WAR video games, and in all honesty parts of the story and the tone of the movie are quite similar to those games.The overall layout of Hell and many of the characters that Dante encounter are actually taken directly from the poem. Also, the narrated segment at the beginning of the film are the opening lines of the poem, spoken word for word. I was actually quite surprised by this.However, if you're looking for solid theology, look somewhere else.  Other than taking basic ideas from Christianity and the overall theme of good conquering evil, there's nothing in this movie that comes close to good theology.In terms of animation, the animation is decent and at times beautiful (even in Hell there is beauty).  There were six different animators on the project so there are times that a character physically changes from one scene to the next.  For instance Beatrice's brother, Francesco, has a different hair color and body-type almost every time he is seen.There are a lot of people who would not enjoy anything at all in DANTE'S INFERNO. However, if you realize that the movie is extremely graphic and explicit and it's only loosely based on the famous poem and don't mind poorly written dialogue (it seems that Dante yells Beatrice several hundred if not a thousand times), it's not too bad. It can work as an introduction to either the famous poem or DANTE'S INFERNO video game.  Recommended for people who have an interest in Dante, who are curious about the video game DANTE'S INFERNO, or those who enjoy extremely graphic and explicit animated movies.The special features on the DVD include animatics of several scenes in the movie as well as a trailer for the video game.",3,"To Hell, But Not Back (2 1/2 Stars)",1268956800,"03 19, 2010",2010,4526,"['Dante', 'Alighieri', 'DIVINE', 'COMEDY', 'more', 'specifically', 'THE', 'INFERNO', 'had', 'tremendous', 'influence', 'culture', 'been', 'decade', 'read', 'poem', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'video', 'game', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'based', 'THE', 'INFERNO', 'really', 'intrigued', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'game', 'idea', 'what', 'main', 'storyline', 'would', 'be', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'PS3', 'XBOX', '360', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'story', 'game-developers', 'created', 'watching', 'DVD', 'based', 'game.So', 'DANTE', 'INFERNO', 'animated', 'movie', 'conceived', 'six', 'different', 'directors', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'loosely', 'based', 'Middle', 'Age', 'Italian', 'poem', 'Get', 'movie', 'Dante', 'Aligheiri', 'version', 'story', 'apparently', 'son', 'English', 'lord', 'gone', 'off', 'Crusades', 'fight', 'King', 'Richard', 'win', 'Jerusalem', 'back', 'Muslims', 'flashback', 'seen', 'key', 'points', 'Dante', 'journey', 'revealed', 'Dante', 'was', 'involved', 'very', 'horrible', 'acts', 'Holy', 'Land', 'home', 'find', 'family', 'beloved', 'Beatrice', 'whom', 'betrothed', 'murdered', 'Beatrice', 'supposedly', 'pure', 'soul', 'rise', 'Heaven', 'snatched', 'Satan', 'taken', 'Hell', 'gateway', 'left', 'open', 'Dante', 'living', 'mortal', 'pursuit', 'Beatrice', 'taken', 'deep', 'Hell', 'Satan', 'make', 'bride', 'Dante', 'assumption', 'can', 'save', 'Beatrice', 'only', 'able', 'make', 'nine', 'levels', 'Hell', 'alive', 'Dante', 'want', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'Beatrice', 'again', 'help', 'Virgil', 'who', 'spirit', 'guide', 'tortures', 'level', 'famous', 'people', 'there', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'open', 'door', 'next', 'level', 'fighting', 'way', 'nine', 'planes', 'Hell', 'addition', 'fighting', 'Hell', 'minions', 'Dante', 'cross', 'real', 'artifact', 'thorn', 'crown', 'Christ', 'believe', 'Dante', 'can', 'use', 'save', 'souls', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'Hell.Just', 'poem', 'DANTE', 'INFERNO', 'incredible', 'violent', 'graphic', 'are', 'babies', 'crawling', 'around', 'four', 'legs', 'giant', 'scissor', 'appendages', 'women', 'genitalia', 'can', 'eat', 'person', 'pierce', 'heart', 'zombie', 'desert', 'warriors', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'harpies', 'demons', 'Appendages', 'get', 'slashed', 'gore', 'gushes', 'out', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'are', 'literally', 'rivers', 'blood', 'Oh', 'also', 'nudity', 'lots', 'lots', 'nudity', 'numerous', 'full', 'frontal', 'females', 'once', 'awhile', 'full', 'frontal', 'male', 'Oh', 'lots', 'cursing', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'f-bomb', 'being', 'spoken', 'are', 'lots', 'lots', 'damns', 'when', 'Dante', 'something', 'really', ""'ve"", 'played', 'first', 'two', 'GOD', 'OF', 'WAR', 'video', 'games', 'honesty', 'parts', 'story', 'tone', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'similar', 'games.The', 'overall', 'layout', 'Hell', 'many', 'characters', 'Dante', 'encounter', 'are', 'actually', 'taken', 'directly', 'poem', 'Also', 'narrated', 'segment', 'beginning', 'film', 'are', 'opening', 'lines', 'poem', 'spoken', 'word', 'word', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'surprised', 'this.However', ""'re"", 'looking', 'solid', 'theology', 'look', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Other', 'taking', 'basic', 'ideas', 'Christianity', 'overall', 'theme', 'good', 'conquering', 'evil', 'nothing', 'movie', 'close', 'good', 'theology.In', 'terms', 'animation', 'animation', 'decent', 'times', 'beautiful', 'even', 'Hell', 'beauty', 'were', 'six', 'different', 'animators', 'project', 'are', 'times', 'character', 'physically', 'changes', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'instance', 'Beatrice', 'brother', 'Francesco', 'different', 'hair', 'color', 'body-type', 'almost', 'time', 'seen.There', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'enjoy', 'anything', 'DANTE', 'INFERNO', 'However', 'realize', 'movie', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'explicit', 'only', 'loosely', 'based', 'famous', 'poem', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'poorly', 'written', 'dialogue', 'Dante', 'yells', 'Beatrice', 'several', 'hundred', 'not', 'thousand', 'times', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'can', 'work', 'introduction', 'either', 'famous', 'poem', 'DANTE', 'INFERNO', 'video', 'game', 'Recommended', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'interest', 'Dante', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'video', 'game', 'DANTE', 'INFERNO', 'who', 'enjoy', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'explicit', 'animated', 'movies.The', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'animatics', 'several', 'scenes', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'trailer', 'video', 'game']",N/A
