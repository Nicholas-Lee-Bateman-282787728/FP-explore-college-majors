He wants to watch this every day! every night!  It is his favorite next to Winnie the Pooh.Even though this video came out a few years ago, Blue's Clues still seems to be in the loop for toddler entertainment.My son is 18 months and totally adores this. Even though he can't completely follow everything, it is still very good at helping him acquire learning skills.  He is already repeating a lot of the words that he hears, and gets his hips shaking along with Steve's.Fun music, animation, and dancing...highly recommend this one!!Eileen Famiglietti",5,Seen this about 500 times now.,1027382400,"07 23, 2002",2002,674,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'video', 'son', 'inherited', '6', 'yr.', 'old', 'cousin', 'who', 'know', 'Blue', 'Steve', 'watch', 'day', 'night', 'favorite', 'next', 'Winnie', 'Pooh.Even', 'video', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'still', 'be', 'loop', 'toddler', 'entertainment.My', 'son', '18', 'months', 'totally', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'completely', 'follow', 'everything', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'helping', 'acquire', 'learning', 'skills', 'already', 'repeating', 'lot', 'words', 'hips', 'shaking', 'along', ""Steve's.Fun"", 'music', 'animation', 'dancing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'Eileen', 'Famiglietti']",Blue's Clues - Story Time VHS
