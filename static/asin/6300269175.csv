Sure, there is a neat plot trick in the beginning of the film, but John Wayne couldn't keep up with the momentum that well. He pretty much looked done for his acting career, failing to transcend well into the 70's, especially out of his usual saddle and a Winchester rifle. Al Leitieri, best known for his work in The Godfather, overacted in this film.  The story per se may be nice and all that, but it could have worked just fine for a soap opera show as well. A lot of McQ had the feel of made-for-TV. The last fifteen minutes of McQ served up another surprise, but it didn't excuse the snoozer of a film for me. I really liked the three car chase on the beach, and I've never seen anything like it before. Probably the weirdest scene of the film is the one with John Wayne and the coked-up elderly hooker. There is something about it that made me feel queasy.

233842,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6300269175,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[8, 11]","I guess ones enjoyment of the film McQ (1974) is based largely on ones being able to accept a John Wayne aka Marion Michael Morrison in a role one would normally expect see a much younger actor in (Wayne was pushing 70 at the time), perhaps a Clint Eastwood or Steve McQueen.  I was a bit skeptical at first, and maybe the fit never felt complete to me, but even for a man as on in the years as he was, I think Wayne did well, and the movie ended up being a lot of fun in a slightly cockeyed sort of way.  Written by Lawrence Roman (A Kiss Before Dying), the movie was directed by Hollywood veteran John Sturges (Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, The Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape).  Starring is, as I mentioned, John Wayne (Rio Lobo, Brannigan), along with Eddie Albert (The Longest Yard, The Devil's Rain), Diana Muldaur (""McCloud""), and Colleen Dewhurst (The Dead Zone).  Also appearing is Clu Gulager (The Return of the Living Dead), David Huddleston (The Big Lebowski), Jim Watkins (Cool Breeze), Julie Adams (Creature from the Black Lagoon), Roger E. Mosley (""Magnum, P.I.""), and Al Lettieri, a man who made a career out of playing `heavies' in such films as The Godfather (1972), The Getaway (1972), and Mr. Majestyk (1974) before his untimely death in 1975.As the film, set in Seattle, begins its open season on the police as two cops are shot dead by a mysterious gunman in the quiet moments of the early morning.  Not only that, but the original mysterious gunman is then shot in the back by another mysterious gunman...what the hell's going on?  Turns out one of the men shot was Sgt. Stan Boyle, close friend of Detective Lt. Lon McQ (Wayne), who also had an attempt on his life the very same morning (the would be killer got blasted).  Captain Kosterman (Albert) believes the violence is related to dirty, longhaired, radical, hippy militants, but McQ thinks the recent spate of bloodshed leads back to a local businessman named Manny Santiago (Lettieri), who everyone knows is actually the source for illegal drugs in the Seattle area.  After butting heads one too many times with his boss, the obstinate Kosterman (the latest tussle over a bathroom beating McQ gave Santiago in a restaurant), McQ quits the force and decides to continue the investigation by becoming a private investigator, but guess what?  Without the juice of the detective's shield, McQ's network of sleazy, underworld contacts (snitches) dries up (welcome to the private sector), and the information he wants becomes very expensive, but the leads do come, many of which point to a place he doesn't want to go...Was this Wayne's attempt to stay relevant with the popular cinematic themes of the time?  I'd say yes, as the film seems something of an amalgam of previously released `cops who play by their own rules' movies like Bullitt (1968), starring Steve McQueen, and Dirty Harry (1971), starring Clint Eastwood...perhaps this was meant to be a Dirty Harry for the geriatric set?  I don't know, but Wayne did look slightly uncomfortable, especially when the jive talk started flyin', most of it provided by the streetwise snitch Rosey, played by Mosley...""What choo gonna do?  Go fist city on me?""  Also, he did look a little out of place speeding around in a souped up Trans Am, one that had a whole lot of junk in the trunk (damn shame what they did to that car)...and check out the scene with McQ in the disco, looking for his snitch...talk about sticking out like a sore thumb...but, despite these aspects, I felt Wayne gave it an excellent effort, showing the professionalism and experience that made him the film icon he is...the weakest element, in my opinion, was the story itself, which seemed mostly borrowed from other movies, despite the inclusion of some interesting twists, like Santiago and his plan to steal from the police.  I thought the red herring element a little too obvious (especially within the character played by Eddie Albert), but I truly wasn't sure who was involved until just prior the revelation.  The roguish, divorced (his ex couldn't compete with his devotion to duty) police detective investigating the death of someone close to him, unable to acquiesce to a seemingly ambivalent higher ups, slams his shield down to work the case on his own (he does, in fact, have a good relationship with his ex-wife, which goes against the cinematic norm).  By the way, McQ sure seemed to draw the ladies...sad when a character from a movie in his twilight years gets more action than I do...Who's the white private d!ck that's a sex machine to all the chicks?  McQ!  Can you dig it?  You damn right!  The strengths lie in the strong direction and also the solid acting, especially within the supporting cast.  Director Sturges creates an uncomplicated sense of flow, keeping the story moving along, using the backdrop of Seattle very well.  Some parts that would normally seem slow (character development) are kept afloat by better than average performances by Watkins, Muldaur and Dewhurst, who, incidentally, doesn't do any skag.  I liked the hot pursuit car chase sequences (there were three) not because they were car chase sequences, but thoughtfully done, well-planned, professionally shot, highly exciting car chase sequences.  The one near the end was really pretty cool, as the participants raced on the beach, splashing seawater all over (no seagulls were harmed in the making of this movie)...and if you ever had a jones to see John Wayne fire a Ingram 9mm automatic weapon, then this is the movie for you.  Are there better John Wayne movies out there?  You bet, but even a lesser effort from The Duke is better than a lot of the stuff out there...oh, I almost forgot to mention the `waka-cha waka-cha' musical score by Elmer Bernstein...it is definitely dated, but fun nonetheless...The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1), is clear, sharp, and the colors vibrant.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio comes through well, and there are English subtitles.  Special features include a featurette titled McQ:  John Wayne in Action, along with a series of trailers of other films featuring The Duke including Tall in the Saddle (1944), Fort Apache (1948), Blood Alley (1955), The Sea Chase (1955), The Train Robbers (1973), Cahill: United States Marshall (1973), and one for this film.Cookieman108",4,"""Look McQ, on the force or off, you are bad

So, this was a new movie for me, and being a John Wayne fan (not a buff - I don't know all the minutiae of his life and work), I was happy to watch it.  Yes, it has all of the 1970s traits that have become clich&eacute;: the car chases (with cars with bad suspensions), the shrill trumpet heavy score, and some visuals and sound that wouldn't pass for a made-for-TV-movie nowadays.  Still, this movie had an interesting plot with some interesting feints and twists.Wayne plays the end of his career detective, McQ.  His best friend is murdered and everyone suspects it was a drug hit.  I don't want to give any of the plot away if you haven't seen it, because I don't want to direct you towards or away from anyone.  The characters in the movie are all interesting and more complex than you might expect at the beginning of the film. There is the railing against the hippie types, women are clearly not all that liberated yet, and you won't believe how much liquor gets drunk in this movie!McQ is a divorced man whose remarried ex-wife still has some affection for him, but couldn't take the strain of being married to a cop.  His teenage daughter is growing up and while they love each other, he is clearly outside the young woman's life.  She has grown away from him and he has become more of a pleasant memory.  And being a good cop, if a bit rough, his connections with people on the less respectable side of life are the friends he has, even as he pushes them to get him what he needs to know.The movie has some big names in it and they all performances that are more than you would expect at first (Eddie Albert, Colleen Dewhurst, Diana Muldaur, and Al Lettieri (Sollozo from The Godfather) to name the obvious).  This is not a great John Wayne film, but it is pretty darn good.  Wayne even lets himself look a bit seedy (the back of that haircut!) and worn down for the role.  I still think that he was a better actor than his detractors will let on.  His great presence is just so strong that his subtleties are often overlooked.

He routinely beats suspects (or just smart mouthed ""radicals"") then flagrantly lies about it to his superiors -- something Harry Callahan would never have done.  There's a cringe inducing scene where he strikes a genteel tableau with his women's libber ex-wife and her new husband and asks to borrow money.  Perhaps best of all, he beats and robs a drug dealer for some coke to ply a drug-addicted stoolie with, then promptly takes her to bed.  This scene is played with Colleen Dewhurst and her incisive acting contrasted with Duke's oblivious courtliness, make it almost painful to watch.  (We see how Duke would behave after such a sleazy one-night-stand and we get the impression he may not have removed his clothes.)Finally, he takes to the streets with some illegal firepower and there's a great beach chase.

233864,A14JEURPY1CXZB,6300269175,James D. Leverton,"[4, 7]","In the early '70's, John Wayne realized his beloved Western genre was on the decline so he decided to revitalize his career with ""McQ"" (1974), a violent modern-day cops-and-robbers saga in which the miscast screen legend plays a much younger, Trans Am-driving police lieutenant intent on finding the killer of his partner.As the film opens, Seattle police detective Stan Boyle (William Bryant) goes on a killing spree, shooting two police officers before he himself is shot in the back and left for dead.  Upon hearing of his partner's shooting, Lon McQ (John Wayne), comforts Boyle's wife Lois (Diana Muldaur) and vows to find the killer.  He immediately suspects local businessman (and drug kingpin) Manny Santiago (Al Lettieri) while his boss Capt. Kosterman (Eddie Albert) suspects the city's large militant population.  When Boyle dies, McQ goes ballistic and beats up Santiago, leading to his suspension from the force.  McQ then quits in disgust, above the objections of councilman (and police liaison) Franklin Toms (Clu Gulager) and to the delight of Kosterman, who can't stand McQ.  McQ then joins forces with private investigator Pinky Farrow (David Huddleston), using Farrow's agency as a cover in order to investigate Boyle's killing on his own.  It isn't long before McQ, with the help of a couple of low-life informants--a pimp named Rosie (Roger E. Mosley) and a pathetic cocktail waitress/cocaine addict named Myra (Colleen Dewhurst)--tracks the killings not to Santiago but back to city hall, where unknown forces have managed to steal a seized shipment of cocaine from the police itself.  This leads to a series of cat-and-mouse chases where McQ is framed for the theft and finds himself chased by the police and Santiago, who wants the stolen drugs, all the while becoming increasingly aware that his late partner wasn't the innocent victim that he originally thought.Lon McQ (one of the great screen names, IMHO) is a role that would have fit Clint Eastwood like a glove; unfortunately, Wayne is way too old and way too conservative to be believable as a maverick cop.  Quite frankly, he looks ridiculous racing around town in a souped-up green sportscar and talking like a hipster 20 years younger than he actually was at the time.  Albert also looks uncomfortable as McQ's chief foil Capt. Kosterman, but maybe it's because of the horrid plaid suits he's given to wear.  Muldaur is very good as the sympathetic widow who may or may not be a love interest for McQ, Lettieri (who unfortunately died a couple of years after this film was made) a formidably hissable villain and Huddleston scores points as the only person McQ can seemingly trust.  Gulager has scant screen time and barely registers, while Mosley is an embarassing stereotype as the pimp Rosie.  Luckily, the filmmakers compensate for Rosie with the color-blind casting of African-American Jim Watkins in the prime role of McQ's fellow cop.  But top acting honors goes to the great Colleen Dewhurst as Myra.  In her two scenes, Dewhurst gives a terrific performance as a sad, lonely woman whose better days are obviously behind her, creating a vivid and memorable character in less than ten minutes of screen time.  She is one character actress who is definitely missed.Actually, the best part of ""McQ"" are the action sequences, which are expertly staged by director John Sturges and his stunt team.  A wild car chase at the midway point is matched by an exciting scene in which McQ's car is sandwiched between two semis, along with a well-choreographed shootout in a hospital parking lot.  And the final half-hour, in which McQ ties everything together with a (rather unsurprising) surprise revelation of the killers, is supremely exciting, culminating in a terrific car chase down a Pugent Sound beach and a final, tense shootout with Santiago and his henchmen.  Actually, shooting the film on location in Seattle proves to be positively inspired, adding a fresh element to a genre in which nearly all its films were seemingly set in either Los Angeles, San Francisco or New York City.  And, incidentally, check out that cool semiautomatic assault rifle McQ uses in the final scenes, which gets a special credit in the extended opening credit sequence.  As for co-producer Lawrence Roman's script, it is solid, though sharp viewers will solve the mystery long before McQ.  And Elmer Bernstein contributes an appropriate, and memorable score.In all, ""McQ"" is one of my favorite films from my childhood and I continue to enjoy it long into my adulthood, in spite of Wayne's miscasting and the script's shortcomings.  My only question?  Where the heck's the DVD?  Wayne's subsequent (and much better) modern detective thriller ""Brannigan"" has been available for years, as has all of his later films except ""McQ"" and ""The Train Robbers,"" which is also from Warner Bros.  This VHS package just doesn't cut it, especially since Sturges shot ""McQ"" in 2:35:1 panavision widescreen and framed it accordingly, so many scenes suffer in pan-and-scan format, especially a badly formatted early scene in which McQ shoots a fleeing suspect in the back.  (Wayne was famous for refusing to shoot people in the back in his films, so it's anyone's guess why he agreed to do it here.)In all, ""McQ"" is far from John Wayne's best film, but entertains regardless.  When it is finally released on DVD, it will make a great double feature with ""Brannigan.""  *** (out of *****)",3,Where the heck's the DVD?,1095552000,"09 19, 2004",2004,5439,"['early', ""'70"",

The original character of Harry was quite a bit different than what it would become anyway.In fact, Dirty Harry was developed as a starring vehicle for Frank Sinatra. The movie was to be directed by Irvin Kershner (of Star Wars fame). There are pre-production movie posters that were printed that show Sinatra as Harry in a trench coat, and described as a 'tough as nails, beat to hell cop who is tired of the corrupt system.' Unfortunately, very early in the filming, Sinatra suffered a broken wrist and had to drop out of the project.With Sinatra gone, Kershner the director also left.Don Siegel was then hired to direct, and he had a good working relationship with Clint Eastwood, and hired him for the role.The rest is history!And that's the truth!",4,The truth about John Wayne as 'Dirty Harry',1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,1088,"['movie', 'was', 'definately', 'reaction', 'popularity', ""'Dirty"", 'Harry', 'rouge', 'cop-style', 'action', 'movies', 'so', 'popular', 'time.However', 'even', 'wildly', 'claimed', 'Wayne', 'turned', 'down', 'role', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'not', 'true', 'was', 'never', 'asked', 'simply', 'director', 'knew', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'effectively', 'play', 'part', 'original', 'character', 'Harry', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'different', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'anyway.In', 'fact', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'was', 'developed', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'directed', 'Irvin', 'Kershner', 'Star', 'Wars', 'fame', 'are', 'pre-production', 'movie', 'posters', 'were', 'printed', 'show', 'Sinatra', 'Harry', 'trench', 'coat', 'described', ""'tough"", 'nails', 'beat', 'hell', 'cop', 'who', 'tired', 'corrupt', 'system', 'Unfortunately', 'very', 'early', 'filming', 'Sinatra', 'suffered', 'broken', 'wrist', 'had', 'drop', 'project.With', 'Sinatra', 'gone', 'Kershner', 'director', 'also', 'left.Don', 'Siegel', 'was', 'then', 'hired', 'direct', 'had', 'good', 'working', 'relationship', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'hired', 'role.The', 'rest', 'history', 'truth']",N/A

233877,A2O91YORQH16L5,6300269175,"Lee Say Keng ""KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER/TECHNOLOGY...","[4, 5]","I recently watched the reruns of two action movies, McQ & Brannigan, both starring John Wayne, on cable TV. I had watched both of them in the theatres during the mid 70's or so.As a young boy, I have always enjoyed watching John Wayne in so many westerns (Stage-coach, Rio Bravo, True Grit...) & in so many war movies (Green Berets, Sands of Iwo Jima, The Longest Day...).I believe that John Wayne was almost in his late 60's/early 70's when he starred in the above two movies. I also believe that these were the only two movies in which he had played a street-wise no-nonsense cop. That's 'Dirty Harry' style!In the first movie, McQ, he was Police Detective-Lieutenant Lon McQ in Seattle. He investigated the death of his partner & along the way uncovered some corrupt elements in his police department with shady connections to the mob. The signature mobster in the movie, Manny Santiago, was played by Al Lettieri.In the second movie, Brannigan, he was Police Detective-Lieutenant Jim Brannigan in Chicago. He was sent to London to bring back an American mobster on the run, Ben Larkin, (played by John Vernon) & along the way he got entangled with the conservative work-style of Scotland Yard.Despite his age, John Wayne was really remarkable in both roles. Having seen him in so many westerns & war movies, it was refreshing to see him acting in contemporary settings. The hot-pursuit action sequences (car chases & shoot-outs) were really good, considering that era. In McQ, the car chase along the beach, with sea gulls fluttering away for cover, was magnificantly choreographed. In Brannigan, the car chase segment ending at the Tower Bridge was great, too. There was even a large-scale brawl at a London pub...reminiscent of John Wayne's innumerable westerns. The storyline in both movies was quite intriguing. In McQ, he even got to show off his physical prowess with an unlicensed sub-machine gun. That was cool! The dialogue in both movies was witty, too.In Brannigan, one could see how big & tall John Wayne was, when he was in London among the crowd. He really stood out like a sore thumb. His opposite was Commander Sir Charles Swann of Scotland Yard, played by a very fine British actor, Richard Attenborough.

Now don't get me wrong, there are actions, intrigue and backstabbing all over this film as John Wayne takes on most of Seattle's corrupt police and underworld to see justice done. But according to all of his biographies,  even Wayne knew he was in a bad film, poorly scripted and handled. The main problem with this film lies in the simple fact that John Wayne was trying to be Dirty Harry. He knew it, director and scriptwriter knew it and the fans knew it. And it just don't work because John Wayne is not Clint Eastwood. Trying to pretend that he can do what Eastwood can, make him feel and look bit pathetic.The DVD edition of this movie appears to be in very good shape. I got just a regular TV set so I can say with relative state of mind that picture quality is clear, the sound quality is good although the special features lies on a thin side. The movie is shown in its widescreen format which is a good thing.McQ is a movie that totally misfired for John Wayne who was playing a role for which he was totally miscast.

Dirty Harry was a mega-hit, running week after week in theaters, when TWO weeks was considered ""held over"". Now it was the turn for the ultimate macho star, John Wayne. But McQ, by its title alone, gives due to the McQueen blockbuster, Bullit, which though three or four years old, was still a hit at the drive-ins. Comparisons are also obvious to the ultimate macho cop, but Dirty Harry have a cool car?Not that I remember. McQ, like McQueen, had a COOL car-looks like a first year Trans Am (when they were still a Firebird). Face it, the Duke had one phat ride! Of course, this means the vehicle will meet a hideous destruction, and well it does. This is swiftly made up by the Duke snatching up (without paperwork!-oh, the glorious days of carefree gun aquisitions!) a super sweet submachine gun. Our man has style. Not to mention his cool digs on his boat. Add to that a Sixty-plus beefy gent who can pound just about anybody into extra lean hamburger and you got a real reason to visit the beer fridge, sit back in that Lazyboy, and fire up the ree-mote control!A caveat involved with McQ is the initial mixed reaction of seeing John Wayne in such a contemporary setting. It seems strange to me throughout the film. I hadn't seen McQ in ages, not since we took Wayne as an indestructible box office force: an eternal presence for his adoring fans. Like a face on Rushmore, you may not see him all the time, but you knew he's always gonna be there. Now since so much time has passed since his death, the still modernistic world of McQ gave me a closer feel for the Duke than his classic Westerns. It was almost like getting to see a picture he had just made. Once taken for granted, that is an experience now beyond reach.As for the story, its the somewhat standard tough cop raked over by his superiors until he redeems his reputation. The Job is for the star to make something special of it and there are many good scenes with Colleen Dewhurst and especially the terrifically menacing Al Lettieri. Wayne and Lettieri trade some great barbs and bruises before its all over. The ultimate connection Wayne made with his fans was that seeing him in action was kind of like getting to watch your Dad beat up the bad guys. Whether you were 5 or 50, he was the quintessential father-figure. And Dad didn't take no crap from no-one! Does it matter that McQ is a notch down from Dirty Harry? Hell, no, pilgrim!

233907,A3A81ZZ4ANLZ8G,6300269175,"The Critic ""Movie Maniac""","[11, 11]","The ""Duke"" was known throughout his career for playing either cowboys or soldiers, but that all changed for him in 1974.In 1974 John Wayne filmed the first of the only two movies he ever made where he played a cop, McQ (1974) and Brannigan (1975). There has been a rumor circulating for many years that John Wayne was offered the part of ""Dirty Harry"" but as far as I know it's never been confirmed. Written by Lawrence Roman and directed by John Sturges, McQ in my opinion is a very entertaining 70's cop film and John Wayne fans won't want to miss it.John Wayne stars as Detective. Lt. Lon McQ who has been called in to investigate the murder of his best friend and fellow police officer Sgt. Stan Boyle. While trying to solve his friend's murder he is constantly butting heads with his superior Capt. Ed Kosterman who's trying to run interference and undermine McQ's investigation or so it seems? McQ quickly realizes that he'll have to go outside the law to investigate the murder of his dead partner so he resigns from the force and gets a P.I. license and goes it alone. During the investigation McQ becomes involved with his dead partner's widow Lois Boyle and that's when the real fun starts.The film takes place on location in Seattle and benefits from some good acting by John Wayne, Eddie Albert, Al Lettieri, Diana Muldaur and Roger E Mosley. In my opinion there are plenty of plot twists and enough action throughout the movie to please John Wayne fans. What this film lacks in dialogue it more than makes up for in its character development and action sequences. McQ also benefits from a decent soundtrack and awesome musical score from Elmer Bernstein.Warner Home Video has done a decent job with the release of McQ on DVD. The movie is presented in its 2.35:1 Widescreen aspect ratio and the video and sound transfer in my opinion is excellent. The image is crisp and clear and the colors are vibrant and sharp. The Dolby Digital 2.0 mono is crisp and clean and it sounds great on my home theatre system. McQ may not have been one of John Wayne's best films but I believe he gave it everything he had and in the end McQ is a solid cop film.The Cast:John Wayne.......Det. Lt. Lon McQEddie Albert.....Capt.

I'll admit that on the surface John Wayne playing a tough, renegade, ""Dirty Harry"" style cop may be a bit far-fetched, but hey, it's John Wayne...few could ever match his screen presence so you just accept it as a pretty entertaining cop action film.  There's certainly some ""Bullitt"" influence as well with the car chases and Wayne driving a Trans Am.Wayne is Lon McQ whose partner turns out was involved in some dirty doings and is killed because of it.  Wayne finds out a drug kingpin (Al Lettieri) was responsible for the murder and goes after him.  When McQ's superior Captain Kosterman (Eddie Albert) suspends him, he quits the force and joins the PI firm of his friend ""Pinky"" (David Huddleston).  Duke now can go after Santiago and his men and garners help from an aged junkie informer played by Colleen Dewhurst in a short but strong role.  The supporting cast is rounded out with Diana Muldauer and Clu Gulager.The film is punctuated by what is actually a number of good (for the era) action sequences climaxed by an auto chase and shootout with Duke wielding an automatic weapon on a beach in what really is an exciting scene.  One can certainly argue that all of the main actors including Wayne, Albert, and Dewhurst were a bit too long in the tooth for the roles they are playing but so what.  It's still an enjoyable film with Wayne, even at 67 years old displaying the macho toughness that had made in a huge star for over 40 years.

233909,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6300269175,trebe,"[2, 2]","Screen legend John Wayne mostly appeared in westerns, war films, or as an adventurer or seafaring man.  McQ (1974) and Brannigan (1975) are among Wayne's last films, and the only two which feature `The Duke' as a modern day police officer.  Of the two, McQ is the superior film.  Set in Seattle, and directed by action veteran John Sturges, McQ is a fast-paced, gritty, and violent drama that concerns drugs, and corruption on the force.It's a rough day for police detective Lon McQ (Wayne), when a number of officers, including a close friend, are gunned down, and McQ finds himself dodging bullets as well.  Manny Santiago (Al Lettieri) is the operator of a shipping firm, who is suspected of dealing drugs.  The police brass pull McQ off the streets for leaning on Santiago, prompting his resignation from the force.  Quickly becoming a private eye, McQ begins working his underworld contacts in search of answers.McQ's does his best to prevent it, but after a load of confiscated drugs scheduled for disposal is hijacked, things get more complicated, and it becomes clear that members of the police are involved in the theft.  With drugs worth over two million dollars missing, the level of violence builds, as McQ's prized Pontiac GTO gets sandwiched between a couple of semi trucks, with him inside.  Santiago has gone through a lot of trouble, and he's determined to score more than just some sugar.  The film's action highlight is a thrilling car chase on the beach, and a shootout featuring an Ingram MAC-10 machine gun.The settings and situations may be different, but John Wayne is right at home as a headstrong detective.  Even at 67, he has the stamina for a physically demanding role.  The story is gritty, well-written, and holds together pretty well, with a few twists that make matters interesting.  In addition to Lettieri, the solid supporting cast includes Diana Muldaur, Eddie Albert, Colleen Dewhurst, Clu Gulager, David Huddleston, Roger E. Mosley, Jim Watkins, and Julie Adams.  Elmer Bernstein contributes a bold and brassy score.
