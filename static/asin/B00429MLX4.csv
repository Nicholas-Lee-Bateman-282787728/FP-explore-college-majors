1382601,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00429MLX4,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Giuseppe Tornatore has created another long loping beautiful film. Baaria is not as moving or as wonderful as Cinema Paradiso, but it is equally infectious.Baaria is a very long slow moving film. At two and a half hours, it requires a nice intermission. In a way, it is like a wonderful well developed book of 800 pages. It takes a long time to get engaged in long books; character development takes a long time. But by the time page 800 is reached, I never want that book to end. When the credits started rolling, I realized how much I enjoyed this film and didn't want it to end.This is the story of a family in a small village in Italy. The story follows three generations of family members. Of course, life, love, birth, and death are all part of the story. Like that 800 page book, a lot happens, and it is almost impossible to summarize the story. Over the course of this film, I came to love and hate Peppino. I cared a lot about what happened to him and others, the mark of a very well made film.I love Cinema Paradiso; I count it as one of the best films I have ever seen. Baaria is a good film, but it is not as bittersweet as Cinema Paradiso. Where the earlier film has the most amazing sad ending, this film rolls to a stop - there isn't a closing moment where everything is tied up in a neat little package. There are a lot of the same things going on in both films. Tornatore is very clear about how difficult and beautiful it was growing up in the poverty in the 20's in Italy. He has a child's eye view of that time.The film is in Italian with English subtitles. It is unrated. If it had been presented to the MPAA, it would probably have an R rating; there was some strong language in the subtitles. I believe there was some nudity, but it wasn't gratuitous or inappropriate. My guess would be that if a younger viewer has watched foreign films and doesn't mind subtitles, this film would be appropriate.This isn't a film for everybody. It is long. The character development takes a good long time. The cinematography is outstanding. In the end, it was a wonderful time to spend with this director reflecting on his life.Cinema Paradiso [Blu-ray]",5,Long Beautiful Film,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,2163,"['Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', 'created', 'long', 'loping', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Baaria', 'not', 'moving', 'as', 'wonderful', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'equally', 'infectious.Baaria', 'very', 'long', 'slow', 'moving', 'film', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'nice', 'intermission', 'way', 'wonderful', 'well', 'developed', 'book', '800', 'pages', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'engaged', 'long', 'books', 'character', 'development', 'long', 'time', 'time', 'page', '800', 'reached', 'never', 'want', 'book', 'end', 'When', 'credits', 'started', 'rolling', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'end.This', 'story', 'family', 'small', 'village', 'Italy', 'story', 'three', 'generations', 'family', 'members', 'course', 'life', 'love', 'birth', 'death', 'are', 'part', 'story', '800', 'page', 'book', 'lot', 'almost', 'impossible', 'summarize', 'story', 'course', 'film', 'came', 'love', 'hate', 'Peppino', 'cared', 'lot', 'what', 'happened', 'others', 'mark', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'film.I', 'love', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'count', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Baaria', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'bittersweet', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', 'Where', 'earlier', 'film', 'most', 'amazing', 'sad', 'ending', 'film', 'stop', ""n't"", 'closing', 'moment', 'where', 'everything', 'tied', 'up', 'neat', 'little', 'package', 'are', 'lot', 'same', 'things', 'going', 'films', 'Tornatore', 'very', 'clear', 'how', 'difficult', 'beautiful', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'poverty', '20', 'Italy', 'child', 'eye', 'view', 'time.The', 'film', 'Italian', 'English', 'subtitles', 'unrated', 'had', 'been', 'presented', 'MPAA', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'R', 'rating', 'was', 'strong', 'language', 'subtitles', 'believe', 'was', 'nudity', 'was', ""n't"", 'gratuitous', 'inappropriate', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'younger', 'viewer', 'watched', 'foreign', 'films', ""n't"", 'mind', 'subtitles', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate.This', ""n't"", 'film', 'everybody', 'long', 'character', 'development', 'good', 'long', 'time', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'end', 'was', 'wonderful', 'time', 'spend', 'director', 'reflecting', 'life.Cinema', 'Paradiso', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",Baaria
1382602,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00429MLX4,Grady Harp,"[28, 29]","BAARIA is another masterwork form the consummate film artist Giuseppe Tornatore.  Tornatore is so highly regarded in Italy and Sicily that famous actors fight for the opportunity to work in one of his luminous films, agreeing to take minute walk on roles just to be near the director: Monica Belluci, &Aacute;ngela Molina, Beppe Fiorello, Raoul Bova etc.  This film deserves close attention form the viewer - and in some ways it may be better to view the DVD's Interview with Giuseppe Tornatore BEFORE watching this film so that the writer/director's concept and technique is understood before the story unfolds.Baar&igrave;a is Sicilian slang for Bagheria where Tornatore was born and this is an autobiographic epic of three generations in the Sicilian village where he was born. It begins in the 1920's where Giuseppe ""Peppino"" Torrenuova lives with his brother Nino and his parents in a hovel. They are so poor that Peppino's father advises him to become a shepherd in order to help support the family. Peppino progresses to taking a cow around the town to fill the milk buckets of the townspeople, struggles through school, progresses to young adulthood when he falls in love with Mannina and going against Mannina's family's dream of having their daughter marry money, the two elope - in the home of Mannina! - and it is here that the characters become the adults who carry the film.  Of note, Tornatore elected to cast the main characters with little known Sicilian actors: Peppino is Francesco Scianna and Mannina is Margareth Mad&egrave; - both brilliant in their roles.  From this point the time passes through historical references to Il Duce, the mafia, WW II and the coming of the Americans, but more important is Peppino's idealistic concept that his future lies in politics.  He becomes a Communist, rises in the ranks, eventually even visiting Moscow to meet with Stalin, and returns to Baaria to help the people struggle for land reform and socialism, all the while he continues to have children with Mannina and follow his dreams of being a successful politician, a dream that is as fragile as it is unattainable.The film flashes back and forth in time and has no linear story line: Tornatore is more interested in taking snippets of his memories of his past life growing up in Baaria than he is in keeping the audience clear about the characters who flash in and out of the story.  His use of children is magical - they seem more wise in their innocence that the adults.  But take the movie for what it is - a m&eacute;lange of remembered moments in the writer/director's life - and witness some of the most beautiful moments ever created for the screen, such as the eventual death of Peppino's father who passes his wisdom to his son, and Peppino's advice to this oldest son as the son takes the train to Rome: the son asks 'Why do people call us hotheaded?' to which Peppino answers 'Because we think we can embrace the Universe, but our arms are too short.'  Peppino's wisdom he passes to his son is to follow his heart at all costs and there will he find satisfaction. This film is overflowing in such moments and watching it is like opening a treasure trunk full of dazzlingly memories. The musical score by the evergreen Ennio Morricone is absolutely one of his finest - a score the composer created in conjunction with Tornatore.There is a problem with the DVD that hopefully someone will solve: the English subtitles (the film is in Italian and Sicilian) are very difficult to read - so bleached out  are they over backgrounds of bright Sicilian light.  It is a post-production flaw that needs to be corrected for non Italian speaking audiences, but even with that minor problem, this is one of the most touching and tender and emotionally satisfying films this viewer has ever seen. 10 stars!

1382605,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00429MLX4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[13, 13]","With both a literal and a figurative nod to Federico Fellini, Italian auteur Giuseppe Tornatore has created ""Baaria."" A personal epic spanning five decades in the life of a typical Italian family, there is undeniable beauty and lyricism in Tornatore's vision. His beloved ""Cinema Paradiso"" was a striking blend of nostalgia, whimsy, fantasy and heartfelt drama that struck a chord with both viewers and critics. It won an Oscar, as well as a slew of other awards, and is widely considered a modern masterpiece. With ""Baaria,"" he adheres closely to a similar formula but with decidedly mixed results. I had heard one of two things about ""Baaria"" prior to catching it on this presentation. Some said it was a masterpiece, some said it was an utter disaster. And in truth, I do believe the film to be divisive. I expected to fall in love with the movie, but I ended up admiring individual elements as opposed to embracing it in its entirety. Part of the film's unusual quality is that it seems both completely intimate to the filmmaker but more noticeably aloof to the viewer. In the film's construction, Tornatore advances through the years and presents some compelling moments without ever slowing down enough to let us actually become invested. This choice might be embraced by some, but the lack of emotional connection is what will create the film's strongest detractors.As always, Tornatore's film is a beautiful physical specimen. The technical aspects of art direction and cinematography enhance the movie's appeal, and it really looks crisp and clean. Taking place in a small Sicilian hamlet called Bagheria (of which the title Baaria is a nickname), the bulk of the film deals with a small boy who advances through his life to old age within the narrative. Not only do we see his world and family, but we see the political structure of the country change around him. I enjoyed much of this perspective as there were subtle lessons in history sprinkled throughout the piece. Certain moments have a pleasant sweetness, some are more tough. It's as if we are catching random glimpses of the characters as time progresses. And in truth, I really liked the idea of the film. However, if I'm being completely honest--the device, while interesting, is also what caused me to disconnect from the story. Just when something of interest happens, you move on. Nothing has time to resonate. How can you watch someone's life story and still not particularly know them or care about them? That is ultimately how I felt with ""Baaria.""And yet, I still can't completely discount Tornatore's conception. It's big, bold and adventurous. Sure, it veers to the fantastical once too often--but here is a filmmaker with a specific point of view. It wasn't wholly successful for me, but it didn't lack in ambition (which so many films do). The movie itself ranks at about 3 1/2 stars for my taste.  But the DVD features are enough to make me round up and should be appreciated by Tornatore fans. He is front and center in a commentary track, in behind the scenes footage, in an interview, and at the film's premiere. In addition, some deleted scenes are also present.  Clearly, this was a personal and important project for the director. I just wish that I had felt the same passion as he has for the work. KGHarris, 10/11.",4,"How Do You Measure The Life Of A Man?
