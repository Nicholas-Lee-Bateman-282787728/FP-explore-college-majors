Have sat through the (2)collection sets on 11/1/02, and immediately became an instant connoisseur of the The Fall & Rise of Reginald Perrin.  I am the only one in my family, as well as circle of friends, who enjoys British humor.  I continue to look for opportunities to purchase good British humor and mysteries.  Have all of Sherlock Holmes-Jeremy Brett; Keeping Up Appearance; To The Manor Born; Rumpole of the Bailey; The Irish R.M.; several sets of Hercule Poirot hourly show as well as the complete set of Poirot movies; several sets of Miss Marple Mysteries; the Norman Conquest; (2) sets of Brother Cadfael; Fawlty Towers, and apart from The Norman Conquest, have never, never, never been disappointed.  With every order, I can't hardly wait for the shipments to arrive.  Each shipment brings me that marvelous British humor, which is subtle yet disarming.  With every mystery, I am glued to the armchair.The Fall & Rise of Reginald Perrin provoked feelings I had during my working years--times when I felt like running away from the dullness of the routine, and the weightiness of the stress!  Though each episode is laced with subtle humor, each also will probably touch the heart strings of many who have been employed on a job for many years, and yet longing for something that renews the excitement that onced burned bright.  Reggie's solution to this challenge is the grist for some dynamite episodes.  I desperately want Series 3 to complete the entire program.  Tried getting them from the UK, but can't locate, and furthermore the video system used in the UK is different than that used in the United State.  Is there anyone out there who might be willing to part with Series 3??????",5,British Comedy & Drama Fan!!

23878,A16QODENBJVUI1,0773399372,Robert Moore,"[18, 18]","Over twenty-five years after it first appeared, this series remains one of the funniest ever made for English-language television. There are several reasons that it is a good series. There is one reason that it is a very great one: Leonard Rossiter. While the scripts are uniformly excellent, while the various cast members range from good to excellent, and while the creative forces behind the series never flag in their inventiveness and energy, this would have been merely a good but forgettable show without Leonard Rossiter's incarnation of Reginald Perrin.This is a tragically forgotten or unknown show in the United States (it hasn't been repeated on public television in many years), so few in the U.S. are aware of the prodigious comic talents of Rossiter. But for anyone who has seen these episodes, Reginald Perrin will always be unforgettable. What made the character of Reggie Perrin so successful was in part a result of Rossiter's complete mastery of physical comedy (in normal life he was a highly accomplished athlete), and the pliability of his face, whose expressions included every facial tic, grimace, and leer known to humanity. But perhaps even more important was Rossiter's often rapid-fire and manic verbosity. Even when relaxed Reggie spurts his words out, and at his most intense, he speaks so quickly that the viewer may need to rewind several times to catch all the bits and pieces that he either speaks aloud or mutters under his breath.The premise of the series is exquisitely absurd: a business executive comes to the end of his tether, fakes his own suicide (which allows him to attend his own funeral and later date his own widow, all while pretending to be a friend of the deceased), and then returns to start his own company, one that makes and sells absolutely nothing that has anything of any value or usefulness. There are a huge number of delightful running gags, such as CJ's constant refrain of ""I didn't get where I am today . . . "" to Reginald's instantly visualizing a hippo every time his mother-in-law is mentioned (and the usually delightful, mischievous grin that accompanies such flight of fancy).A great, great show, and an even greater comedian. Neither ought to be forgotten. Fans of Monty Python and Fawlty Towers will find this utterly delightful.",5,One of the truly great comic characters in TV history,1030233600,"08 25, 2002",2002,2302,"['twenty-five', 'years', 'first', 'appeared', 'series', 'one', 'funniest', 'ever', 'made', 'English-language', 'television', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'good', 'series', 'one', 'reason', 'very', 'great', 'one', 'Leonard', 'Rossiter', 'scripts', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'various', 'cast', 'members', 'range', 'good', 'excellent', 'creative', 'forces', 'series', 'never', 'flag', 'inventiveness', 'energy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'merely', 'good', 'forgettable', 'show', 'Leonard', 'Rossiter', 'incarnation', 'Reginald', 'Perrin.This', 'tragically', 'forgotten', 'unknown', 'show', 'United', 'States', ""n't"", 'been', 'repeated', 'public', 'television', 'many', 'years', 'so', 'few', 'U.S.', 'are', 'aware', 'prodigious', 'comic', 'talents', 'Rossiter', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'episodes', 'Reginald', 'Perrin', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'unforgettable', 'What', 'made', 'character', 'Reggie', 'Perrin', 'so', 'successful', 'was', 'part', 'result', 'Rossiter', 'complete', 'mastery', 'physical', 'comedy', 'normal', 'life', 'was', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'athlete', 'pliability', 'face', 'expressions', 'included', 'facial', 'tic', 'grimace', 'leer', 'known', 'humanity', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'was', 'Rossiter', 'often', 'rapid-fire', 'manic', 'verbosity', 'Even', 'when', 'relaxed', 'Reggie', 'words', 'out', 'most', 'intense', 'so', 'quickly', 'viewer', 'may', 'need', 'rewind', 'several', 'times', 'catch', 'bits', 'pieces', 'speaks', 'aloud', 'mutters', 'breath.The', 'premise', 'series', 'exquisitely', 'absurd', 'business', 'executive', 'end', 'tether', 'fakes', 'own', 'suicide', 'attend', 'own', 'funeral', 'later', 'date', 'own', 'widow', 'pretending', 'be', 'friend', 'deceased', 'then', 'returns', 'start', 'own', 'company', 'one', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'anything', 'value', 'usefulness', 'are', 'huge', 'number', 'delightful', 'running', 'gags', 'such', 'CJ', 'constant', 'refrain', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'where', 'am', 'today', 'Reginald', 'instantly', 'visualizing', 'hippo', 'time', 'mother-in-law', 'mentioned', 'usually', 'delightful', 'mischievous', 'grin', 'such', 'flight', 'fancy', 'great', 'great', 'show', 'even', 'greater', 'comedian', 'ought', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Fans', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'will', 'find', 'utterly', 'delightful']",N/A
