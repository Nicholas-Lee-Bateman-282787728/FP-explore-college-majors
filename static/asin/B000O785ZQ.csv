1062929,AIMR915K4YCN,B000O785ZQ,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[1, 1]","THE CLOWN MURDERS begins w/ a scintillating game of polo between a group of pompous rich guys. Lawrence Dane (SCANNERS, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME) plays the head zillionaire, Phillip Sutherland. John Candy plays poor, persecuted Ollie. Shortly thereafter, it's time for the big Halloween party. The rest of the group decides to pull a prank on Phillip. Needless to say, things don't go exactly according to plan, resulting in police involvement. One of the pranksters is up to something more than simply playing a trick. THE CLOWN MURDERS is a not-very entertaining, non-thrilling, fairly idiotic film. It also commits the unpardonable sin of being extremely boring! I kept waiting, no, praying for something, anything remotely interesting to happen! Well, at the mid-way point, a mysterious figure dons a discarded clown mask, and begins stalking around. I actually wept at this point! Alas, after several more precious minutes elapse, nothing of any consequence takes place. Oh, people do eventually, blessedly die. By then however, I was ready for death myself! This is a damned shame, since the final 10 minutes are pretty intense. If only the other 86 minutes had been as entertaining...

The film seems like it doesn't quite know what it wants to do with itself yet still manages to have a eerie feel to it that seems to consistantly grow throughout. The climax, even though pretty tame held up to todays standards(though all over the place as well) still makes you feel somewhat dirty & abused...like being forced to witness something that you shouldn't have.In the end a film like this may not be for everyone but for those of you who (like myself) really have a sweet tooth for those obscure lost 70's weirdy flicks ""The Clown Murders"" is pretty much a keeper.",3,A Bit Messy But Weird and creepy  Enough To Earn A  Spot In My Collection!,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,763,"['Clown', 'Murders', '1976', 'featuring', 'early', 'performance', 'young', 'un-funny', 'John', 'Candy', 'one', 'foggy', 'oddball', 'some-what', 'creepy', 'films', 'only', '1970', 'could', 'cough', 'up', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'yet', 'still', 'have', 'eerie', 'feel', 'consistantly', 'grow', 'climax', 'even', 'pretty', 'tame', 'held', 'up', 'todays', 'standards', 'place', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'dirty', 'abused', 'being', 'forced', 'witness', 'something', 'should', ""n't"", 'have.In', 'end', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'who', 'really', 'have', 'sweet', 'tooth', 'obscure', 'lost', '70', 'weirdy', 'flicks', 'Clown', 'Murders', 'pretty', 'much', 'keeper']",The Clown Murders
