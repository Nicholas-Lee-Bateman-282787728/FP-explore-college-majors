This movie is not like those films at all but what is good that it has its own style and you can't compare it to other films. You will love the graphics and not to mention the beautiful Cecillia Cheung. If you are not into fantasy films then don't waste your time reading this because this movie has graphics up the A** and that's what so unique and great about this film. But what is important is don't buy The promise that they are advertising here because when you watch the movie a little sing pops out saying DVD and something else and you can tell that even though the picture quality is great it was ripped from the internet.This version is 1 hour and 50 mins and contains 2.0 Dolby Suround and the special features can not be accessed until the movie credits are over. And the special features are only 4mins of one trailer footage so this version sucks. What I did is I got the imported 2 Disc Special Extened Cut of The Promise DVD on ebay and you Know what this is worth every penny even the DVD cover art is beautiful and this is what my version contains.12 MINS OF ADDDED FOOTAGEDisc 1 (NTSC Disc Format All Reigion DVD) 2 hour and 2 mins5.1 Dolby Digital6.1 Dolby Digital DTS2.0 Dolby Suround (which actually sounds better in this disc.)16x9 2:35 WidescreenProduction Photos and movie stillsDisc 2 (PAL Disc Format)-(So you need multi regional DVD player or a PC DVD-ROM,PS2,XBOX.Or you can copy it and transfer it in to a NTSC DVD-R)Cast & crew interviews & filmographiesDirectors interviewAbout 5 or 6 Behind the scenes featuresand more.So like I said great movie but get this one that i'm talking about.",5,Great cinema for asian movie fans.

984183,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B000F73V2W,Erica Anderson,"[9, 11]","I had the fortunate experience of seeing ""The Promise"" in theatre over the past weekend. I personally loved it even though I don't like love stories and I am tired of the atypical Chinese film ala ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero"" with its over the top martial arts. I was also pleased that finally there was film from China that didn't star Zhang Ziyi whom I have never been too wild about as an actress.Cecilia Cheung stars as Qingcheng as an orphaned girl who is given the opportunity to change her destiny from being impoverished and orphaned to having all the riches in the world. The only catch is that all the men she will love over the years will be lost to her.For the first twenty - thirty minutes of the film, the story focuses on General Guangming and his slave Kunlun. General Guangming wears this lavished red military attire. When the general is unable to go rescue the king from the enemy WuHuan, he has Kunlun wears his armor and sends him to rescue the king. It is Kunlun in the armor with the mask down that Qingcheng falls in love with. Needless to say, the encounterleads to deception, love, betrayal and death through out the entire film.The costumes were absolutely stunning especially Guangming's armor. I personally liked the computer generated effects. The music fit perfectly with the mood of each scene. It was nice for once to see a movie that actually made sense and wasn't as confusing like ""The House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Hero"". My only beef is that the beginning of the film with General Guangming and his army who were up against an enormous army of barbarians dragged on a bit too long. Overall I enjoyed ""The Promise"" immensely.",5,A beautiful film,1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,1677,"['had', 'fortunate', 'experience', 'seeing', 'Promise', 'theatre', 'past', 'weekend', 'personally', 'loved', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'love', 'stories', 'am', 'tired', 'atypical', 'Chinese', 'film', 'ala', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'Hero', 'top', 'martial', 'arts', 'was', 'also', 'pleased', 'finally', 'was', 'film', 'China', 'did', ""n't"", 'star', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'whom', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'too', 'wild', 'actress.Cecilia', 'Cheung', 'as', 'Qingcheng', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'who', 'given', 'opportunity', 'change', 'destiny', 'being', 'impoverished', 'orphaned', 'having', 'riches', 'world', 'only', 'catch', 'men', 'will', 'love', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'her.For', 'first', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'story', 'General', 'Guangming', 'slave', 'Kunlun', 'General', 'Guangming', 'lavished', 'red', 'military', 'attire', 'When', 'general', 'unable', 'go', 'rescue', 'king', 'enemy', 'WuHuan', 'Kunlun', 'wears', 'armor', 'rescue', 'king', 'Kunlun', 'armor', 'mask', 'down', 'Qingcheng', 'love', 'Needless', 'say', 'encounterleads', 'deception', 'love', 'betrayal', 'death', 'entire', 'film.The', 'costumes', 'were', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'especially', 'Guangming', 'armor', 'personally', 'liked', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'music', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'scene', 'was', 'nice', 'once', 'see', 'movie', 'actually', 'made', 'sense', 'was', ""n't"", 'confusing', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'Hero', 'only', 'beef', 'beginning', 'film', 'General', 'Guangming', 'army', 'who', 'were', 'up', 'enormous', 'army', 'barbarians', 'dragged', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'Promise', 'immensely']",N/A
984184,A3E5OY3YLZMOA9,B000F73V2W,"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ...","[1, 1]","In the beginning a starving young girl named Qingcheng is seen prying food out of the hands of dead soldiers in a forest. While running home to share her bread with her mother she drops it in a lake. As she starts to cry the bread is brought back to her by a goddess and she tells Qingcheng to eat the bread but she will not eat because she is saving it for her sick mother. The goddess tells Qingcheng that her mother is dead and then offers her a choice of riches and beauty but all men she falls in love for will die unless she can turn back time and undo what she has just done. She's a little girl with nowhere to go and no food so of course this deal is too tempting to pass up and she accepts. A while later during a battle of a 3000 man army defeating 20,000 barbarians a slave named Kunlun with a speedy gift is discovered while trying to outrun the barbarians.Kunlun's ability impresses general Guangming  also known as ""Master of the Crimson Armor"" and is taken in as a slave by the general. The general has been informed that the King is being attacked by Duke Wuhuan from the north but before he can get there he is attacked by Wuhuan's assassin Snow Wolf, the general is saved by Kunlan but receives a bad wound trying to defend himself. The general can't make the journey to protect the king and sends Kunlun with his crimson armor instead. The general tells Kunlun that the king will be the only one without a weapon. Kunlun goes to protect the king and when he arrives at the palace sees a man with a sword about to kill a beautiful woman and kills him before he can get to the woman and then flees with her. Kunlun eventually is cornered by Wuhuan's men and is told if he jumps into the waterfall behind him the princess will live but before he jumps he promises the princess he will never let her die.This is one movie that had the money, a cool plot, and even had a good cast to support it. I think the first mistake was the director went crazy with his budget and though I do realize this is a fantasy movie but there is just too much. There was too much CGI and it was done ridiculously bad, there were fight scenes but they were bad fight scenes. The fights were awfully choreographed like the director got his child to choreograph the scenes for him. You could barely see anything when there was a fight because there was a weird cinematography that was used during the scenes, it will remind you of the type in ""Warriors of Virtue"" used in a bad way. The story goes everywhere before it ends, the princess's character is written poorly. She's supposed to be in deep love but how does fall in love with a guy she just met and then fall in love with another guy.The thing with ""The Promise"" is not the back-story because it is interesting but the way it develops is crazy its too slow and makes feelings unrealistic. How can you truly believe that the princess is in love when she just met the guy and even worse isn't even the guy that she thinks saved her. Despite a bad script the actors keep you interested in the film until the end. The settings are undoubtedly beautiful, which is noticed right from the beginning, but the CGI should have been scrapped and done with more taste. The fights which were suppose to be a big part of this film could have helped give this film more interest and life but that fails. All you will be watching this film for is its gorgeous settings.",2,I Don't Know What They Were Thinking,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,3404,"['beginning', 'starving', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Qingcheng', 'seen', 'prying', 'food', 'hands', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'forest', 'running', 'home', 'share', 'bread', 'mother', 'lake', 'cry', 'bread', 'brought', 'back', 'goddess', 'Qingcheng', 'eat', 'bread', 'will', 'not', 'eat', 'saving', 'sick', 'mother', 'goddess', 'Qingcheng', 'mother', 'dead', 'then', 'choice', 'riches', 'beauty', 'men', 'love', 'will', 'die', 'can', 'turn', 'back', 'time', 'undo', 'what', 'just', 'done', 'little', 'girl', 'nowhere', 'go', 'food', 'so', 'course', 'deal', 'too', 'tempting', 'pass', 'up', 'while', 'later', 'battle', '3000', 'man', 'army', 'defeating', '20,000', 'barbarians', 'slave', 'named', 'Kunlun', 'speedy', 'gift', 'discovered', 'trying', 'outrun', 'barbarians.Kunlun', 'ability', 'general', 'Guangming', 'also', 'known', 'Master', 'Crimson', 'Armor', 'taken', 'slave', 'general', 'general', 'been', 'informed', 'King', 'being', 'attacked', 'Duke', 'Wuhuan', 'north', 'can', 'get', 'there', 'attacked', 'Wuhuan', 'assassin', 'Snow', 'Wolf', 'general', 'saved', 'Kunlan', 'bad', 'wound', 'trying', 'defend', 'general', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'journey', 'protect', 'king', 'Kunlun', 'crimson', 'armor', 'instead', 'general', 'tells', 'Kunlun', 'king', 'will', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'weapon', 'Kunlun', 'protect', 'king', 'when', 'palace', 'man', 'sword', 'kill', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'can', 'get', 'woman', 'then', 'flees', 'Kunlun', 'eventually', 'cornered', 'Wuhuan', 'men', 'told', 'waterfall', 'princess', 'will', 'live', 'princess', 'will', 'never', 'let', 'die.This', 'one', 'movie', 'had', 'money', 'cool', 'plot', 'even', 'had', 'good', 'cast', 'support', 'think', 'first', 'mistake', 'was', 'director', 'went', 'crazy', 'budget', 'do', 'realize', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'CGI', 'was', 'done', 'ridiculously', 'bad', 'were', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'bad', 'fight', 'scenes', 'fights', 'were', 'awfully', 'choreographed', 'director', 'got', 'child', 'choreograph', 'scenes', 'could', 'barely', 'see', 'anything', 'when', 'was', 'fight', 'was', 'weird', 'cinematography', 'was', 'used', 'scenes', 'will', 'remind', 'type', 'Warriors', 'Virtue', 'used', 'bad', 'way', 'story', 'everywhere', 'princess', 'character', 'written', 'poorly', 'supposed', 'be', 'deep', 'love', 'how', 'fall', 'love', 'guy', 'just', 'met', 'then', 'fall', 'love', 'guy.The', 'thing', 'Promise', 'not', 'back-story', 'interesting', 'way', 'crazy', 'too', 'slow', 'feelings', 'unrealistic', 'How', 'can', 'truly', 'believe', 'princess', 'love', 'when', 'just', 'met', 'guy', 'even', 'worse', ""n't"", 'even', 'guy', 'saved', 'bad', 'script', 'actors', 'keep', 'interested', 'film', 'end', 'settings', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'beautiful', 'noticed', 'right', 'beginning', 'CGI', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'scrapped', 'done', 'more', 'taste', 'fights', 'were', 'suppose', 'be', 'big', 'part', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'give', 'film', 'more', 'interest', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'settings']",N/A

It's got the discipline of the Zhang Yimou movies and the dopiness of the 90s HK movies. Watching this movie, I felt like the director shot the screenplay as is without rewrites and managed to use a lot of the better sets with production values.What I didn't get was an ounce of passion.

984190,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000F73V2W,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Chen Keige's misbegotten The Promise is possibly the only Asian film that can make you feel sorry for Harvey Weinstein, who pre-brought the film before realizing that he'd made a big mistake on seeing the end result. It's hard not to think that all that bad karma from cutting Asian films to ribbons finally caught up with him with this one. I should have known what to expect when I saw Etchie Stroh's name as one of the producers. It's not a total loss, but it is a helluva mess just on a technical level, boasting probably the worst CGI effects in a big budget film. Some of them look just one step up from animatics or late 80s arcade games, while the opening stampede plays like a Road-Runner cartoon crossed with an early Neolithic cave painting. But then the sound mixing is sometimes equally awkward, leaving you with the impression that the film was rushed into completion in the hopes of scoring some Oscar nominations that they didn't quite manage to finish any it. Of course, it is just possible that everyone concerned saw what a totally bonkers movie this is and decided to sneak home early from work each day.It's not fair to describe it as Asia's Alexander, because although often horribly executed, there was a governing intelligence behind that. By contrast, this seems more of a cynical attempt to capture a slice of the international market Zhang Yimou and Ang Lee cornered with a fantasy epic cum fairytale. Unfortunately, despite a promising initial premise and mostly game performances, Kaige really isn't suited to this kind of material and seems to be throwing in elements simply because they worked in other people's hit movies. There are a few good moments - the wall of time flashback, the ending - but most of it is just so bizarrely wrong that you just go on watching to see what comes up next.
