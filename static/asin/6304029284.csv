396861,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6304029284,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","THE THREE LIVES OF THOMASINA must rank as one of the most delicately moving, utterly charming and yes, most unusual films from the Disney live-action canon.  Set in Scotland circa. 1912 and based on Paul Gallico's book of the same name, it's an unforgettable film which explores a frequent theme in Disney's works - the power of transformation.Young Mary McDhui (Karen Dotrice) lives with her widower father Andrew (Patrick McGoohan), the local veterinarian in their small Scottish village.  Mary spends her days playing with her beloved tabby-cat Thomasina (voiced with warm sincerity by Elspeth March).  It's a carefree world which comes to a crashing, tragic end when Thomasina is injured in an accident and Andrew refuses to treat her, believing her injuries to be too severe to recover from.  Mary's opinion of her father is shattered as a consequence, and as well as her cherished Thomasina, Mary begins to insist that her father, too, has died.Thomasina, though, hovers between life and death.  In a spectacular sequence where Thomasina flies toward Cat Heaven, she instead begins her second life - in the care of the town's local ""witch"", Lori MacGregor (Susan Hampshire).  Lori lives in a secluded part of the woods and her rare touch with injured animals has earned her a reputation which rivals Andrew's in the community.  Unaware of Thomasina's past, Lori nurses the cat back to vitality.  The same cannot be said for Mary, who has fretted so much that her own health starts to decline...It was in THE THREE LIVES OF THOMASINA that Walt Disney first paired Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber, the two enchanting child actors who'd later be immortalised as the Banks children in ""Mary Poppins"".  Garber plays Mary's friend Geordie McNab in THOMASINA and he is utterly enchanting, more than holding his own in lovely scenes with Susan Hampshire and Patrick McGoohan.The film has a few dark elements (the gypsy circus and scenes of distress involving animals).  I would be careful about screening THOMASINA for younger children, but for those aged 10 and over, I can't see any real issues.  THE THREE LIVES OF THOMASINA is one of the most unusual and enchanting films from the ""golden period"" of live-action Disney films.  Highly recommended.  The DVD includes a fairly recent interview with star Susan Hampshire which is a nice touch.",4,"Charming, unusual film from the Disney studios",1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,2342,"['THREE', 'LIVES', 'OF', 'THOMASINA', 'must', 'rank', 'one', 'most', 'delicately', 'moving', 'utterly', 'charming', 'yes', 'most', 'unusual', 'films', 'Disney', 'live-action', 'canon', 'Set', 'Scotland', 'circa', '1912', 'based', 'Paul', 'Gallico', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'frequent', 'theme', 'Disney', 'works', 'power', 'transformation.Young', 'Mary', 'McDhui', 'Karen', 'Dotrice', 'widower', 'father', 'Andrew', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'local', 'veterinarian', 'small', 'Scottish', 'village', 'Mary', 'days', 'playing', 'beloved', 'tabby-cat', 'Thomasina', 'voiced', 'warm', 'sincerity', 'Elspeth', 'March', 'carefree', 'world', 'crashing', 'tragic', 'end', 'when', 'Thomasina', 'injured', 'accident', 'Andrew', 'treat', 'believing', 'injuries', 'be', 'too', 'severe', 'recover', 'Mary', 'opinion', 'father', 'shattered', 'consequence', 'as', 'well', 'cherished', 'Thomasina', 'Mary', 'insist', 'father', 'too', 'died.Thomasina', 'hovers', 'life', 'death', 'spectacular', 'sequence', 'where', 'Thomasina', 'Cat', 'Heaven', 'instead', 'second', 'life', 'care', 'town', 'local', 'witch', 'Lori', 'MacGregor', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'Lori', 'secluded', 'part', 'woods', 'rare', 'touch', 'injured', 'animals', 'earned', 'reputation', 'Andrew', 'community', 'Unaware', 'Thomasina', 'past', 'Lori', 'cat', 'back', 'vitality', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Mary', 'who', 'fretted', 'so', 'much', 'own', 'health', 'starts', 'decline', 'was', 'THE', 'THREE', 'LIVES', 'OF', 'THOMASINA', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'first', 'paired', 'Karen', 'Dotrice', 'Matthew', 'Garber', 'two', 'enchanting', 'child', 'actors', 'who', ""'d"", 'later', 'be', 'immortalised', 'Banks', 'children', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Garber', 'Mary', 'friend', 'Geordie', 'McNab', 'THOMASINA', 'utterly', 'enchanting', 'more', 'holding', 'own', 'lovely', 'scenes', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan.The', 'film', 'few', 'dark', 'elements', 'gypsy', 'circus', 'scenes', 'distress', 'involving', 'animals', 'would', 'be', 'careful', 'screening', 'THOMASINA', 'younger', 'children', 'aged', '10', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'real', 'issues', 'THREE', 'LIVES', 'OF', 'THOMASINA', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'enchanting', 'films', 'golden', 'period', 'live-action', 'Disney', 'films', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'recent', 'interview', 'star', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'nice', 'touch']",N/A

It has hovered in my imagination for over 40 years, and now with a lovely DVD transfer I can check to see just how shameful and naive my childish infatuation was. And I can honorably report that Thomasina is almost as good as I remember!I watched this for the first time with my nine year old grandson, and he liked it as much as I. He's a sensitive and smart young man, a bit lonely and prone to solitude, as I was. And he was as enchanted as I remember being. Susan Hampsire is beautiful, oh yes, I never loved a movie star again as I loved her. Not only gorgeous but kind, generous, sweet and utterly sure of herself. Who wouldn't want to marry her? And Patrick McGoohan, whom I loved in Scarecrow (please don't be lying again about a release this fall, please!!!), was just as good here.But what sets this movie above the run of the mill Disney films, which were far better than nearly everything out there today, is the well-examined battle between science and religion. McGoohan, the man of science, gruff and brutally honest, revels in self-pity after the loss of his wife and has rejected God. Hampshire, the woodland sprite with an unending belief in goodness and in God, demonstrates conclusively that there are some things science cannot explain. This argument is still with us, (see ""Expelled"") with science currently managing to claim it offers a plausible explanation for everything, though those increasingly convoluted descriptions will probably eventually crumble as Ptolemy's did. But with so many good things packed into one film, great child actors, gorgeous scenery, small town prejudice and gossip, humor, charm, and love...what could be better?",5,My first love,1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,1763,"['When', 'was', 'about', '9', 'first', 'saw', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'was', 'utterly', 'enchanted', 'hovered', 'imagination', '40', 'years', 'now', 'lovely', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'can', 'check', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'shameful', 'naive', 'childish', 'infatuation', 'was', 'can', 'honorably', 'report', 'Thomasina', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'remember', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'grandson', 'liked', 'as', 'much', 'sensitive', 'smart', 'young', 'man', 'bit', 'lonely', 'prone', 'solitude', 'was', 'was', 'as', 'enchanted', 'remember', 'being', 'Susan', 'Hampsire', 'beautiful', 'oh', 'yes', 'never', 'loved', 'movie', 'star', 'again', 'loved', 'Not', 'only', 'gorgeous', 'kind', 'generous', 'sweet', 'utterly', 'sure', 'herself', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'marry', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'whom', 'loved', 'Scarecrow', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'lying', 'again', 'release', 'fall', 'please', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'here.But', 'what', 'movie', 'run', 'mill', 'Disney', 'films', 'were', 'far', 'better', 'nearly', 'everything', 'out', 'there', 'today', 'well-examined', 'battle', 'science', 'religion', 'McGoohan', 'man', 'science', 'gruff', 'brutally', 'honest', 'revels', 'self-pity', 'loss', 'wife', 'rejected', 'God', 'Hampshire', 'woodland', 'sprite', 'unending', 'belief', 'goodness', 'God', 'conclusively', 'are', 'things', 'science', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'argument', 'still', 'see', 'Expelled', 'science', 'currently', 'managing', 'claim', 'plausible', 'explanation', 'everything', 'increasingly', 'convoluted', 'descriptions', 'will', 'probably', 'eventually', 'crumble', 'Ptolemy', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'packed', 'one', 'film', 'great', 'child', 'actors', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'small', 'town', 'prejudice', 'gossip', 'humor', 'charm', 'love', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'better']",N/A

Bernabo,"[50, 55]","Paul Gallico's charming little story &quot;Thomasina&quot; is turned into an equally lovely little Disney film from 1964 directed by Don Chaffey (&quot;Greyfriars Bobby&quot;).  Veterinarian Andrew MacDhui (Patrick McGoohan) is a widower who is raising his young daughter Mary (Karen Dotrice) in Scotland in 1912.  Andrew has no empathy for the townsfolk who love their pets and when Mary's beloved cat Thomasina is injured he quickly decides the animal should be killed.  Mary is distraught and Andrew simply cannot understand why the logic of the situation is not clear to the girl.  Mary and her friends prepare an elaborate funeral for Thomasina, at which point Lori MacGregor (Susan Hampshire) shows up.  The children think she is a witch, but in truth she lives in the woods and nurses injured animals back to health using love and common sense.  Lori recognizes the cat is not dead and takes it home to help it recover, during which time Thomasina goes to Cat Heaven in a marvelously fanciful sequence.  Andrew has a bad reputation with the locals because he killed his daughter's cat and they start taking their pets to Lori.  Andrew finally goes to see her and is not so busy being impressed by her healing skills that he fails to fall in love with her.  But then Mary sees Thomasina walking outside her house and chases after her in a driving storm and ends up catching pneumonia.  The doctors hold out no hope to the frantic Andrew, and Lori tells him that only he can help Mary recover using the power of love.Lots of Disney movies have a cold-hearted adult transformed into a human being, and &quot;The Three Lives of Thomasina&quot; is one of the best of this type of film, even better than &quot;Pollyanna. &quot;  This is mainly because it has the virtue of a first-rate cast, from McGoohan, Hampshire and Dotrice as the three principles to Finlay Currie and Laurence Naismith standing out in the supporting cast.  Elspeth March supplies the voice of Thomasina, who gets to comment on the action from time to time, and Matthew Garber, who went on with Dotrice to play the kids in &quot;Mary Poppins,&quot; also has a small role.

Perhaps in today's flashy special effects world this movie is ""boring,"" but it is full of rich characterizations, especially McGoohan's Andrew McDhui, a man hardened not only by the death of his wife, but by being forced into a profession he thought was demeaning. It is a rich psychological portrait of both the man and his daughter, whose realities are mixed after the untimely events surrounding the injury of her cat. Disney changed the modern setting of the original novel and made it a 1912 period piece, which is beautifully set. Karen Dotrice is wonderful as the troubled Mary, and Disney regulars Vincent Winter, Denis Gilmore (both were also in the television movie The Horse Without a Head), and Matthew Garber memorable and often amusing as her friends.

396884,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6304029284,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 3]","My fondness for this film extends from having watched it when it first appeared in 1964.  Being all of eight years old I was quite impressed by the story and particularly by the special effects.  I am less impressed by the movie as an adult, but the movie remains cute and charming and I suspect children today will enjoy it.Mary McDhui (played by Karen Dotrice, better known to many as Jane Banks in the movie ""Mary Poppins"") is the daughter of Andrew McDhui (played by veteran actor Patrick McGoohan), a veterinarian.  Mrs. McDhui recently passed away and her death has affected both of them.Mr. McDhui is quite unpopular as he has put down several animals for a variety of reasons.  While his reasons are more accepted by our modern understanding of animal health and a better understanding of suffering, for the era portrayed in the film he seems more of a harsh, unfeeling and mean man rather than a healer of animals.The movie would have been quite boring had not Mary McDhui's cat Thomasina become ill after an accident.  Mr. McDhui is attempting to help the seeing-eye dog of a man when Mary rushes in with her cat, apparently paralyzed with tetanus.  Mr. McDhui is more focused on saving the dog than on Mary's cat, and in an instant the relationship of father and daughter change significantly.Fortunately, we have already met local ""witch"" Lori MacGregor (played by beautiful Susan Hampshire).  Lori is able to work miracles with animals not because she has the scientific skill of Mr. McDhui, but because she loves them and cares for them selflessly.  Thus, she is a polar opposite, or complement, to Mr. McDhui.  Her role in this movie will become clear shortly.Mary and her friends have already interacted with Lori.  They have taken animals to her and she has healed them with her ""magic.""  Lori comes upon the children when they are preparing to bury Thomasina, who is actually not dead but paralyzed.  Lori frightens the children away and discovers the cat.  Lori takes the cat to her hut in the woods and tends to the cat.Somewhere in this midst of Thomasina's paralysis is a wonderful scene with the cat in a dream-like state that I enjoy each time I see it.  Thomasina learns that she must return to the world because there is more for her to do.  But when Thomasina returns, she has lost all memory of her life with Mary.The players are all in place and the final acts are ready to begin, but you will have to watch the movie to see how it all comes out.  Will Mary and her father reconcile?  How far do the complementary talents of Lori and Mr. McDhui extend?  Is it possible that they need each other?  What of poor Thomasina?  Just where will the pivotal character in our play end up, and will she return to life healthy?I have said in previous reviews that when Disney got a film right, the results were fun and enjoyable.  Such is the case with this film.  Disney chose a quaint story and executed filming well.  This film marked Karen Dotrice's first appearance along with Matthew Garber's first appearance as Mary's friend Geordie.  Soon the pair would star in their greatest role as the Banks children in ""Mary Poppins.""  In this film both were fresh faces and brought a wonderful innocence to their roles.  Patrick McGoohan is a great actor who excels in all his roles, and the relationship between him and Susan Hampshire was natural fun to watch evolve.  Susan Hampshire was wonderful in her role and seemed much like a real country girl.This Disney movie classic belongs in all family home film libraries.  Though there are a few intense moments in the movie that earn this film a PG rating, I believe this film is suitable for even the youngest members of the family with a little adult guidance and participation.Enjoy!",4,Cute Disney Feature,1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,3754,"['fondness', 'film', 'having', 'watched', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', '1964', 'Being', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'story', 'particularly', 'special', 'effects', 'am', 'less', 'impressed', 'movie', 'adult', 'movie', 'cute', 'charming', 'suspect', 'children', 'today', 'will', 'enjoy', 'it.Mary', 'McDhui', 'played', 'Karen', 'Dotrice', 'better', 'known', 'many', 'Jane', 'Banks', 'movie', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'daughter', 'Andrew', 'McDhui', 'played', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'veterinarian', 'Mrs.', 'McDhui', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'death', 'affected', 'them.Mr', 'McDhui', 'quite', 'unpopular', 'put', 'down', 'several', 'animals', 'variety', 'reasons', 'reasons', 'are', 'more', 'accepted', 'modern', 'understanding', 'animal', 'health', 'better', 'understanding', 'suffering', 'era', 'portrayed', 'film', 'more', 'harsh', 'unfeeling', 'mean', 'man', 'rather', 'healer', 'animals.The', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'boring', 'had', 'not', 'Mary', 'McDhui', 'cat', 'Thomasina', 'become', 'ill', 'accident', 'Mr.', 'McDhui', 'attempting', 'help', 'seeing-eye', 'dog', 'man', 'when', 'Mary', 'rushes', 'cat', 'apparently', 'paralyzed', 'tetanus', 'Mr.', 'McDhui', 'more', 'focused', 'saving', 'dog', 'Mary', 'cat', 'instant', 'relationship', 'father', 'daughter', 'change', 'significantly.Fortunately', 'have', 'already', 'met', 'local', 'witch', 'Lori', 'MacGregor', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'Lori', 'able', 'work', 'miracles', 'animals', 'not', 'scientific', 'skill', 'Mr.', 'McDhui', 'cares', 'selflessly', 'Thus', 'polar', 'opposite', 'complement', 'Mr.', 'McDhui', 'role', 'movie', 'will', 'become', 'clear', 'shortly.Mary', 'friends', 'have', 'already', 'interacted', 'Lori', 'have', 'taken', 'animals', 'healed', 'magic', 'Lori', 'children', 'when', 'are', 'preparing', 'bury', 'Thomasina', 'who', 'actually', 'not', 'dead', 'paralyzed', 'Lori', 'children', 'away', 'cat', 'Lori', 'cat', 'hut', 'woods', 'cat.Somewhere', 'midst', 'Thomasina', 'paralysis', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'cat', 'dream-like', 'state', 'enjoy', 'time', 'see', 'Thomasina', 'must', 'return', 'world', 'more', 'do', 'when', 'Thomasina', 'returns', 'lost', 'memory', 'life', 'Mary.The', 'players', 'are', 'place', 'final', 'acts', 'are', 'ready', 'begin', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'Will', 'Mary', 'father', 'reconcile', 'How', 'far', 'do', 'complementary', 'talents', 'Lori', 'Mr.', 'McDhui', 'extend', 'possible', 'need', 'other', 'What', 'poor', 'Thomasina', 'Just', 'where', 'will', 'pivotal', 'character', 'play', 'end', 'up', 'will', 'return', 'life', 'healthy', 'have', 'said', 'previous', 'reviews', 'when', 'Disney', 'got', 'film', 'right', 'results', 'were', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'Such', 'case', 'film', 'Disney', 'chose', 'quaint', 'story', 'executed', 'filming', 'well', 'film', 'marked', 'Karen', 'Dotrice', 'first', 'appearance', 'Matthew', 'Garber', 'first', 'appearance', 'Mary', 'friend', 'Geordie', 'Soon', 'pair', 'would', 'star', 'greatest', 'role', 'Banks', 'children', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'film', 'were', 'fresh', 'brought', 'wonderful', 'innocence', 'roles', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'great', 'actor', 'who', 'roles', 'relationship', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'was', 'natural', 'fun', 'watch', 'evolve', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'was', 'wonderful', 'role', 'seemed', 'much', 'real', 'country', 'girl.This', 'Disney', 'movie', 'classic', 'belongs', 'family', 'home', 'film', 'libraries', 'are', 'few', 'intense', 'moments', 'movie', 'earn', 'film', 'PG', 'rating', 'believe', 'film', 'suitable', 'even', 'youngest', 'members', 'family', 'little', 'adult', 'guidance', 'participation.Enjoy']",N/A

396886,AST7UNIXVOAVA,6304029284,Mark Shanks,"[13, 13]","Seeing action star/spy/""hard guy"" Patrick McGoohan in a ""Disney movie"" was a novel experience, but then this didn't strike me as a typical Disney flick. For one thing, the predominant theme is death. McGoohan's wife is dead, the family cat is put to death, the daughter ""kills and buries"" her father (in her mind) - wow, pretty heavy stuff to lay on a young audience! McGoohan plays the part of a veterinarian in a small Scottish village, but when we're introduced to him, he's not exactly making friends with the locals. He immediately gets a reputation for heartlessness when he suggest to one woman that her very old dog is suffering and would be better off being put to sleep. (He throws in that he thinks she's being selfish, just in case he wasn't already cold-blooded enough!) The family crisis comes when he is in the middle of surgery on a blind man's dog. His daughter arrives with Thomasina, the family cat, who has contracted tetanus. He can't be bothered to even check her out, and instructs his assistant to put her down. Only the most stone-hearted will remain dry-eyed in the following trip to ""cat heaven"". But Thomasina's mission has only begun, and the remainder of the film is McGoohan's attempts to reconcile with his daughter and Thomasina's role in bringing them back together.There are so many things about this movie that put it out of the ordinary. If they dropped the *very* Disney-esque opening theme song and filmed it more at an adult eye-level (it is filmed very much from the physical point of view of a child), and added a Merchant/Ivory sepia tone, this would be regarded as a great adult movie or ""Masterpiece Theater"" (think ""All Creatures Great and Small"") material. The Scottish accents (including at one scene in Gaelic) must have been incomprehensible to children's audiences when it was released, and Thomasina's ""funeral"", including bagpipes, bier, and procession through town, is not the sort of thing I'd imagine kids found cheery.Totally unlike anything being made today, it isn't so much anachronistic as a reminder of how dumbed-down and emotionally sterile children's programming has become. It doesn't flog any specific message, but is definitely a movie that (if you can get a little one used to more frantic entertainment to sit through it) will make a deep and positive impression.

396890,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,6304029284,Midge,"[32, 58]","I saw this movie when it came out in 64. I was eight at the time. I've always adored Disney films and I love cats... especially the orange tabby's which were always my favorite. I had one just like Thomasina at the time and always have throughout my life. I try to collect as many of Disney's movies as I can... except this one.With that said, the beginning of this movie really upset me as a child and still upsets me to this day when something reminds me of it. My parents and I were caught off guard. We did not expect to see something like this on a Disney film. My parents thought I would love a movie about cats but had no idea about the disturbing content. As much as I have always adored cats, I have never been able to watch this movie a second time.I simply could not endure watching this cat being ordered to be put to sleep by the adults at the beginning of this movie as if it was a casually disposable product instead of a living creature and beloved pet of the child. They not only order the cat to be put to sleep, they go through the actual process of putting the cat down and treating it as discarded trash. This affected me deeply at the age of 8 and still bothers me to this day when I think about this movie. The fact that the cat recovered from the botched job didn't make the horrific scene any more palatable.A child doesn't have the luxury of placing a movie in some historic perspective. They watch a movie... literally through the eyes of a child. Things are a lot more real to them than they are to adults. But even adults are affected by movies with strong emotional scenes... so imagine what it is like for a child.It didn't matter to me whether everything came out ok in the end or not. I just couldn't go through that ordeal again. Nor did I find any pleasure in the other mishaps the cat character was subjected to in the storyline. As a child and an adult I found this movie to be very disturbing.I was never affected by any other movie as a child. I was not a sensitive child or adult. I was raised watching horror and space movies since I was 3. I was a fearless child and a fearless adult. Disembodied heads on monster movies didn't bother me a bit even when I was a preschooler. So for any movie to affect me in this way, it had to be profoundly upsetting about something that meant a lot to me... and my cat had been that important to me since I had been 3.So if you have a child who is very attached to cats as I was, I strongly caution you to think twice before showing this movie to your child.I'm sharing this because I want parents to really think about this before allowing their children to see it. Even if your child has never been upset about any prior movie, if your child is devoted to a pet cat, I really don't recommend this movie.In some ways, the movie ""Old Yeller"" is very similarly upsetting when the boy's dog has to be shot. Why is it that these producers of childrens' shows and movies think it is necessary to show the death of the main animal character?It may not seem like a big deal to an adult, but to a child, things like this can be horrific and cause unnecessary distress to a child who loves their pets so devotedly. 45 years later, I still remember how much this movie bothered me. You can choose to disregard my cautions if you like, but if you knew what a strong child I was and even stronger as an adult and retired engineering executive... you might think twice about this. If this movie can have such a profound effect on someone who has been fearless their entire life... think of how it might affect a sensitive child. You might never know about it. This is the first time in 45 years I have mentioned it to anyone. It's just my personal opinion but I thought someone should mention this issue.",3,Caution to parents on disturbing content,1240444800,"04 23, 2009",2009,3770,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', '64', 'was', 'eight', 'time', ""'ve"", 'always', 'adored', 'Disney', 'films', 'love', 'cats', 'especially', 'orange', 'tabby', 'were', 'always', 'favorite', 'had', 'one', 'just', 'Thomasina', 'time', 'always', 'have', 'life', 'try', 'collect', 'many', 'Disney', 'movies', 'can', 'one.With', 'said', 'beginning', 'movie', 'really', 'upset', 'child', 'still', 'upsets', 'day', 'when', 'something', 'parents', 'were', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'see', 'something', 'Disney', 'film', 'parents', 'thought', 'would', 'love', 'movie', 'cats', 'had', 'idea', 'disturbing', 'content', 'As', 'much', 'have', 'always', 'adored', 'cats', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'watch', 'movie', 'second', 'time.I', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'endure', 'watching', 'cat', 'being', 'ordered', 'be', 'put', 'sleep', 'adults', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'casually', 'disposable', 'product', 'instead', 'living', 'creature', 'beloved', 'pet', 'child', 'not', 'only', 'order', 'cat', 'be', 'put', 'sleep', 'go', 'actual', 'process', 'putting', 'cat', 'down', 'treating', 'discarded', 'trash', 'affected', 'deeply', 'age', '8', 'still', 'bothers', 'day', 'when', 'think', 'movie', 'fact', 'cat', 'recovered', 'botched', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'horrific', 'scene', 'more', 'palatable.A', 'child', ""n't"", 'have', 'luxury', 'placing', 'movie', 'historic', 'perspective', 'watch', 'movie', 'literally', 'eyes', 'child', 'Things', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'real', 'are', 'adults', 'even', 'adults', 'are', 'affected', 'movies', 'strong', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'so', 'imagine', 'what', 'child.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'everything', 'came', 'out', 'ok', 'end', 'not', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'ordeal', 'again', 'did', 'find', 'pleasure', 'other', 'cat', 'character', 'was', 'subjected', 'storyline', 'child', 'adult', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'disturbing.I', 'was', 'never', 'affected', 'other', 'movie', 'child', 'was', 'not', 'sensitive', 'child', 'adult', 'was', 'raised', 'watching', 'horror', 'space', 'movies', 'was', '3', 'was', 'fearless', 'child', 'fearless', 'adult', 'Disembodied', 'heads', 'monster', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'bit', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'preschooler', 'So', 'movie', 'affect', 'way', 'had', 'be', 'profoundly', 'upsetting', 'something', 'meant', 'lot', 'cat', 'had', 'been', 'that', 'important', 'had', 'been', '3.So', 'have', 'child', 'who', 'very', 'attached', 'cats', 'was', 'strongly', 'caution', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'showing', 'movie', 'child.I', ""'m"", 'sharing', 'want', 'parents', 'really', 'think', 'allowing', 'children', 'see', 'Even', 'child', 'never', 'been', 'upset', 'prior', 'movie', 'child', 'devoted', 'pet', 'cat', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie.In', 'ways', 'movie', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'very', 'similarly', 'upsetting', 'when', 'boy', 'dog', 'be', 'shot', 'Why', 'producers', 'childrens', 'shows', 'movies', 'think', 'necessary', 'show', 'death', 'main', 'animal', 'character', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'big', 'deal', 'adult', 'child', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'horrific', 'cause', 'unnecessary', 'distress', 'child', 'who', 'pets', 'so', 'devotedly', '45', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'remember', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'bothered', 'can', 'choose', 'disregard', 'cautions', 'like', 'knew', 'what', 'strong', 'child', 'was', 'even', 'stronger', 'adult', 'retired', 'engineering', 'executive', 'might', 'think', 'twice', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'such', 'profound', 'effect', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'fearless', 'entire', 'life', 'think', 'how', 'might', 'affect', 'sensitive', 'child', 'might', 'never', 'know', 'first', 'time', '45', 'years', 'have', 'mentioned', 'anyone', 'just', 'personal', 'opinion', 'thought', 'someone', 'should', 'mention', 'issue']",N/A
396891,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6304029284,Monty Moonlight,"[3, 3]","""The Three Lives of Thomasina"" is the story of a widower veterinarian and his small daughter as much as it is about the title character, Thomasina, a cat whose life, death, and rebirth end up being desperately important to them and their relationship with each other. Also in the mix is a beautiful, young woman living alone in the woods and labeled as a witch, along with a group of local boys who steal the show with their continuous involvement in the film's proceedings. The setting is 1912 in a small Scottish village, and Thomasina is the light of little Mary's life. Her father, however, does not take such a fond view of pets, despite being the local veterinarian. He does his job coldly and by the book, and all too often chooses euthanasia over attempting to help.  When Thomasina herself needs his help one day, the cat's resulting death sends Mary into a troubled state that continues to worsen. Of course, cats have nine lives, and little do they know that a revived Thomasina is living with local ""witch"" Lori and attempting to regain her memory. If only these troubled and lonely souls could all be brought together, but the stubborn bitterness of Mary's father could make that impossible.Released in 1964 and directed by Don Chaffey, ""The Three Lives of Thomasina"" is a beloved classic to Disney fanatics like myself. Starring Disney legends such as Patrick McGoohan (the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh) and not one, but both of ""the Mary Poppins children"", Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber, the film is outstanding in terms of acting from the adults and children alike, and the animals do a decent job too. Thomasina the cat narrates the film in voice over by Elspeth March. The movie opens with a theme song that is much celebrated, but I personally found a little corny in the very beginning (I don't usually feel that way about even the corniest Disney stuff, but...); stick with it despite that though. It's high on drama, and some of the reasoning in this story of science and faith/love/God/magic/etc... finding room to coexist and cooperate with each other doesn't always make sense, but it's easy to ignore. What really holds us here are the relationships between the people involved, and of course, the animals. Thomasina looks great in this rather nice Disney DVD release. It's presented in widescreen and actually has bonus features! There is a theatrical trailer, a montage of Disney cat clips set to music and beginning with Walt's own Thomasina television introduction, and even interview with star Susan Hampshire, still looking great at her age, who played ""Mad Lori"" the sweet but alleged witch who lives in the woods caring for sick and injured animals that find their way to her.""The Three Lives of Thomasina"" is a story that might be kind of serious compared to what some folks expect from Disney, even classic Disney, but it all depends on what you've seen so far. This one deals a lot with the subject of death, and we even get to see a very Egyptian-influenced Cat Heaven during Thomasina's first, brief encounter with the other side. There's also symbolic death, as the very young Mary declares her father dead more than once after he has disappointed her deeply. The thematic elements are advanced enough that the film carries a PG rating. However, this is still very recognizable, classic Disney live-action fair that puts one in mind of such titles as Greyfriar's Bobby, The Horse Without a Head, and the like. Even non-Disney films like The Secret of Roan Inish.

When the cat is seriously injured, Mary's father &quot;puts the cat to sleep&quot; but Thomasina is disovered by Lori MacGregor, who nurses the cat back to health.  Her love and understanding finally reunite father and daughter in the touching climax.  Although the film wasn't a huge box-office success, it was considered  one of the best foreign productions released by the Disney studio in the sixties.",5,FEY SCOTTISH TALE,943920000,"11 30, 1999",1999,946,"['remember', 'watching', 'little', 'gem', 'television', 'Concord', 'California', '1964', 'loved', 'film', 'child', 'just', 'got', 'kids', 'video', 'last', 'night', 'peek', '37', 'years', 'bit', 'as', 'charming', 'Disney', 'earlier', 'GREYFRIAR', 'BOBBY', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'thanks', 'strong', 'cast', 'led', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'infinitely', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'story', 'Scottish', 'veterinarian', 'Andrew', 'MacDhui', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'affection', 'beautiful', 'cat', 'named', 'Thomasina', 'When', 'cat', 'seriously', 'injured', 'Mary', 'father', 'quot', 'cat', 'sleep', 'quot', 'Thomasina', 'disovered', 'Lori', 'MacGregor', 'who', 'cat', 'back', 'health', 'love', 'understanding', 'finally', 'reunite', 'father', 'daughter', 'touching', 'climax', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'box-office', 'success', 'was', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'foreign', 'productions', 'released', 'Disney', 'studio', 'sixties']",N/A

I love animal movies and was looking for a special story about a cat. It's  a touching, sad, and funny movie about a lonely little girls love for her cat and her hardened widowed father. All the children in the movie are adorable. I love it when Thomasina goes to heaven and they give her a funeral, It's a unique heartwarming family movie. It reminds me of ""Old Yeller"" but with a much happier ending.

Adams,"[3, 4]","In Scotland in 1912, a widowed vet with a young daughter shows great technical skill in the job, but his grieving heart won't allow him to empathize with the deep love his neighbors have invested in their pets. He thinks he euthanized his child's sick cat, but she is rescued by the lovely young female recluse up in the hills, whom the local children consider a witch. What becomes of the title feline, the child, the dad, and the witch and how a happy ending is created from much heartache is the story that follows. The lead children in this one, if you have not seen it already, you might recognize from the more successful ""Mary Poppins"" which was made around the same time. If you have kids who can handle the household tension and the death of pets dwelt upon in the first half, you'll like the way the film redeems its characters.
