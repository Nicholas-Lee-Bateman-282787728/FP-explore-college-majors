1068204,A1QM2TH24PYMKR,B000P296EE,ChocolateQT,"[4, 5]","I try to support independent urban films. Most are surpisingly very good. But this has to be the worst of the worst. The plot if you can call it that does come together at all. This movie is really all over the place and you are left to draw your own conclusion A LOT. Many times in the movie I found myself wondering what in the world does this have to do with the movie. Ie. When Jaretha (Elise Neal) was rolling around on the bed looking like she was going through with drawls after Dayvon rescued her from her abusive ex Malik. The person I watched the movie with read Thug Life by Thomas Long thats its based on. He said there is alot to the story that is either left out or just skimmed over. Like the ex (Malik) beats her up, gets her hooked on heroin and turns her into a hooker. You'd never know any of that watching the movie. You'd be like me wondering why she is rolling around on the bed like a fool. Honestly it's like a broke down low LOW budget episode of the Wire, the location is W B-more just like the Wire and with the two of main characters I might add. (Wood Harris who name in this movie Dayvon, in the Wire its Avon...what a far stretch lol and Ed Williams who is Boodie in the Wire) Also is it just me or does it look like for the majority of the movie he is standing on the same corner he was hustling on in the Wire. Any ways I've said it before and I'll say it again. Time is something you can waste, but never get back. This movie is a major waste of time.",1,If I could give it 0 stars I really would,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,1485,"['try', 'support', 'independent', 'urban', 'films', 'Most', 'are', 'surpisingly', 'very', 'good', 'be', 'worst', 'worst', 'plot', 'can', 'call', 'come', 'together', 'movie', 'really', 'place', 'are', 'left', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusion', 'LOT', 'Many', 'times', 'movie', 'found', 'wondering', 'what', 'world', 'have', 'do', 'movie', 'Ie', 'When', 'Jaretha', 'Elise', 'Neal', 'was', 'rolling', 'around', 'bed', 'looking', 'was', 'going', 'drawls', 'Dayvon', 'rescued', 'abusive', 'ex', 'Malik', 'person', 'watched', 'movie', 'read', 'Thug', 'Life', 'Thomas', 'Long', 'based', 'said', 'alot', 'story', 'left', 'out', 'just', 'skimmed', 'over', 'ex', 'Malik', 'up', 'hooked', 'heroin', 'hooker', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'watching', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'rolling', 'around', 'bed', 'fool', 'Honestly', 'broke', 'down', 'low', 'LOW', 'budget', 'episode', 'Wire', 'location', 'W', 'B-more', 'just', 'Wire', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'might', 'add', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'who', 'name', 'movie', 'Dayvon', 'Wire', 'Avon', 'what', 'far', 'stretch', 'lol', 'Ed', 'Williams', 'who', 'Boodie', 'Wire', 'Also', 'just', 'look', 'majority', 'movie', 'standing', 'same', 'corner', 'was', 'hustling', 'Wire', 'Any', 'ways', ""'ve"", 'said', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'Time', 'something', 'can', 'waste', 'never', 'get', 'back', 'movie', 'major', 'waste', 'time']",Tony Austin's 4 Life
