1444221,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B0056P6SOG,A. Estes,"[18, 18]","Coming off the heels of past direct-to-video disappointments like ""Deader"" and ""Deadworld"" -- movies which are assuredly every bit as stupid as their titles suggest -- one would think the ""Hellraiser"" franchise could not sink any lower.One would be wrong.Enter ""Hellraiser: Revelations,"" the ninth installment in the ""Hellraiser"" series and first in over half a decade. Produced in a matter of weeks and on a shoe-string budget, ""Revelations"" is essentially a place-holder produced by your good friends at The Weinstein Company in order to retain rights to the franchise while an inevitable remake rots in development Hell. Absolutely minimal thought and care were put into this ""film,"" as each and every frame oozes with idiocy and contempt for its audience.The plot, while admittedly less convoluted than the past four or so ""Hellraiser"" films, attempts to align itself with the original and in the process fails miserably. Two pseudo-rebellious teens head to Mexico to indulge in a bit of decadence but get more than they bargained for upon stumbling upon the mysterious and ubiquitous puzzle box. That thing just shows up anywhere, huh? When one of the buddies returns home, he brings home tales of macabre madness and a few cenobites on his tail as well. Can his family survive having their souls torn apart? Will Pinhead get what he wants? Is Tijuana really that dirty? Do you really care?Admittedly, the film may have been a bit easier to swallow had they hired actual actors to portray the characters on film. Make no mistake, the film is still ridiculous and embarrassing, but for the most part, it's amateur-hour here, with one actor inexplicably slipping in and out of a Scottish accent. It's a well-known fact that Doug Bradley, who stuck with the character of Pinhead throughout the thick and thin of eight films, was re-cast for the film, partially due to time/budget constraints, but more likely due to the actor having a spine and deciding that enough is enough. His presence is most certainly missed, though he probably couldn't have saved the film anyway. His replacement, whose name isn't even worth looking up, appears to be playing a parody of the character and has neither the screen-presence nor the chops to fill his predecessor's shoes. Heck, they even got the guy who played Handbanana on ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" to do voice-over work for the poor schlub.It's sad to say, but ""Hellraiser: Revelations"" never really stood a chance. Even sadder is that it makes a long-line of dim sequels look like masterpieces by comparison. Like the recent ""Children of the Corn: Genesis"" -- produced under the same conditions and for the same reasons -- this one would have been better left buried. Should we look forward to the remake? Well, if the Weinsteins are involved, that's a big fat ""no."" Get Clive Barker back, get somebody behind the film that actually cares and maybe then Pinhead and his merry band of cenobites can raise Hell again. As for this installment, two infamous words from the first film come to mind: Jesus wept.",1,The Hellraiser Franchise Goes to Hell,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,3048,"['Coming', 'off', 'heels', 'past', 'direct-to-video', 'disappointments', 'Deader', 'Deadworld', 'movies', 'are', 'assuredly', 'bit', 'as', 'stupid', 'titles', 'suggest', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Hellraiser', 'franchise', 'could', 'not', 'sink', 'lower.One', 'would', 'be', 'wrong.Enter', 'Hellraiser', 'Revelations', 'ninth', 'installment', 'Hellraiser', 'series', 'first', 'decade', 'Produced', 'matter', 'weeks', 'shoe-string', 'budget', 'Revelations', 'essentially', 'place-holder', 'produced', 'good', 'friends', 'Weinstein', 'Company', 'order', 'retain', 'rights', 'franchise', 'inevitable', 'remake', 'rots', 'development', 'Hell', 'Absolutely', 'minimal', 'thought', 'care', 'were', 'put', 'film', 'frame', 'idiocy', 'contempt', 'audience.The', 'plot', 'admittedly', 'less', 'convoluted', 'past', 'four', 'so', 'Hellraiser', 'films', 'attempts', 'align', 'original', 'process', 'miserably', 'Two', 'pseudo-rebellious', 'teens', 'head', 'Mexico', 'indulge', 'bit', 'decadence', 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'stumbling', 'mysterious', 'ubiquitous', 'puzzle', 'box', 'thing', 'just', 'up', 'anywhere', 'huh', 'When', 'one', 'buddies', 'home', 'home', 'tales', 'macabre', 'madness', 'few', 'cenobites', 'tail', 'as', 'well', 'Can', 'family', 'survive', 'having', 'souls', 'torn', 'apart', 'Will', 'Pinhead', 'get', 'what', 'Tijuana', 'really', 'dirty', 'Do', 'really', 'care', 'Admittedly', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'easier', 'swallow', 'had', 'hired', 'actual', 'actors', 'portray', 'characters', 'film', 'Make', 'mistake', 'film', 'still', 'ridiculous', 'embarrassing', 'most', 'part', 'amateur-hour', 'here', 'one', 'actor', 'inexplicably', 'slipping', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'well-known', 'fact', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'who', 'stuck', 'character', 'Pinhead', 'thick', 'thin', 'eight', 'films', 'was', 're-cast', 'film', 'partially', 'due', 'time/budget', 'constraints', 'more', 'likely', 'due', 'actor', 'having', 'spine', 'deciding', 'enough', 'enough', 'presence', 'most', 'certainly', 'missed', 'probably', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'saved', 'film', 'anyway', 'replacement', 'name', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'looking', 'up', 'be', 'playing', 'parody', 'character', 'screen-presence', 'chops', 'fill', 'predecessor', 'shoes', 'Heck', 'even', 'got', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Handbanana', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force', 'do', 'voice-over', 'work', 'poor', 'schlub.It', 'sad', 'say', 'Hellraiser', 'Revelations', 'never', 'really', 'stood', 'chance', 'Even', 'sadder', 'long-line', 'dim', 'sequels', 'look', 'masterpieces', 'comparison', 'recent', 'Children', 'Corn', 'Genesis', 'produced', 'same', 'conditions', 'same', 'reasons', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'left', 'buried', 'Should', 'look', 'forward', 'remake', 'Well', 'Weinsteins', 'are', 'involved', 'big', 'fat', 'Get', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'back', 'get', 'somebody', 'film', 'actually', 'maybe', 'then', 'Pinhead', 'merry', 'band', 'cenobites', 'can', 'raise', 'Hell', 'again', 'installment', 'two', 'infamous', 'words', 'first', 'film', 'come', 'mind', 'Jesus', 'wept']",N/A
1444222,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B0056P6SOG,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[8, 8]","While I'm not granting HELLRAISER: Revelations a pass, I do find it funny that Clive Barker released a public statement claiming this 9th movie in the franchise is ""NO F-ING CHILD OF MINE"" when I don't recall reading anything about his disappointment with the previous 4 or 5 movies.  Especially considering movies 5-8 were originally non-Hellraiser movies that were later re-written to include Pinhead, whereas this latest--and hopefully last in line--was actually written as a Hellraiser original.  I mean, it's crap, sure, and it lifts the plot from the first movie, but hey at least the Hellraiser connection doesn't feel as forced here.Steven Craven (Nick Eversman, ""Missing"") and Nico Bradley (Jay Gillespie, 2001 MANIACS) are two privileged California teens off on an adventure.  And that means Tijuana!  The pair wind up stranded after their car is stolen, but they don't let that dampen their moods.  Instead they get wasted and pick up a hooker.  Through the course of a drunken night, however, the prostitute winds up dead, so Steven and Nico do what any red-blooded American rich kid would do: they go to a different bar.  It's here they meet a vagrant who promises them he can introduce them to experiences beyond the limits of anything they've known before.  He hands over a puzzle box, which the two take back to their room.  Nico, the more adventurous and boisterous of the two opens the box, and all Hell breaks loose.For reals.A year later, the boys' families have come to terms with the fact their sons are gone, but that doesn't mean they have to like it.  They get together for dinner one night in the Craven's mountain home, far from the city, and mourn their losses.  But the celebration is short-lived when Steven appears back on their doorstep.  Chaos reigns as the questions fly, but what it comes down to is Nico isn't with him.  Wherever they were, Steven has escaped and is afraid the ones holding them captive are going to come for him.  They try to call an ambulance, even though the blood on Steven isn't his and he doesn't appear to be injured, but phone is out.  They try to transport him to the hospital in the car, but the cars are gone, too.  They suspect foul play.Through flashbacks we find out Nico was taken by the Cenobites after opening the box, but that after Steven killed a hooker in his room, Nico used her blood to help him return, a la Frank Cotton from the original HELLRAISER.  Nico enlisted Steven's aid in killing more Mexican prostitutes in order to be whole again.  But at the critical moment when Nico only needs one more body, Steven chickens out and his skinless friend is left to take matters into his own hands.  Nico needs skin, Steven won't help him get it.  Which means Steven is now useless to Nico.  And Steven's also got all that nice skin.  See where I'm going?Luckily that explains the scene where Steven made out with his sister Emma--Nico's girlfriend.HELLRAISER: Revelations is 75 minutes of lame, unoriginal story, bad acting and disappointment.  But Dimension films was in danger of losing the rights to the franchise, so they had to do something quick.  Do something quick meant spend $300,000 on a 3-week production (including 11 days of filming) and further alienating an already dwindling fanbase by going ahead with the movie sans series regular Doug Bradley who refused to star after reading the script.  Considering the last few Hellraiser movies Bradley HAS taken part in, that's saying something.Instead of the one recognizable figure in the entire Hellraiser canon, the makers cast Chicago native Stephan Smith Collins who, before Hellraiser had starred in nothing any of you have seen and since Hellraiser has been in an episode of ""Castle"" and ""NCIS: Los Angeles"" as Salesperson.  Collins is tall and bald.  That's pretty much the criteria I'm assuming is needed for being Pinhead.  Nevermind he otherwise looks nothing like Pinhead, even with the grey skin and a head full of pins.  And nothing against Collins but, even as bad as this movie was, I believe Bradley's presence would have lent it some small amount of respectability.  Instead the whole thing, from stolen plot to bad imitation of staple villain, comes across as a parody.On the other hand, the story gets back to what Hellraiser was about in the first place.  The thing that was missing from the previous 4 movies was a sense that the Cenobites could be a threat.  Sure, they were IN Hellraisers 5-8, but those stories weren't about the Cenobites, they were stories about humans doing bad things to each other, and those things eventually just led to the Cenobites.  But the Cenobites, and Pinhead in particular, were never the source of the main conflict in those movies.  So while I can't give the movie credit for being GOOD, I can at least respect it for being a Hellraiser movie.The story and script were written by Gary J. Tunnicliffe who has written a few other things as well but is more commonly known as a make-up effects man, having worked on just about everything from several HALLOWEEN movies to PROPHECY movies to HELLRAISER movies to FEAST movies to PULSE movies to WOLVERINE and MY BLOODY VALENTINE and SCREAM 4 and APOLLO 18.  So the man obviously knows his way around a horror movie.  That doesn't necessarily mean he should be in charge of penning the franchise's last gasp, but that wasn't my call.  He also worked the make-up effects for the movie, and those were awesome, especially the Stephen-Cenobite (whoops, did I reveal too much?).The director was Victor Garcia, who seems to be building a career on straight-to-DVD horror sequels to franchises few people cared about in the first place, like RETURN TO HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and MIRRORS 2.  I can't vouch for his work on those movies, but I can say on this one, I've seen worse.  I think he was able to piece together a very coherent story in just 75 minutes by using his time wisely and not lingering on unimportant details.  I think his actors were terrible and the script was stiff, but I admire Garcia's sensibilities in getting the story across in as simple a way as possible.However none of this excuses the fact this is a bad movie.  I know Dimension's back was against the wall and they were working against a very tight deadline, but holy crap, man.  This was their best effort?  At the same time, they turned out an original--well, technically original--Hellraiser movie in 3 weeks, something the previous 4 movies couldn't do on much more lenient schedules.  Which says to me Hellraisers 5-8 were just plain lazy.With any luck, HELLRAISER: Revelations is the END of this franchise.  Amid talk of a remake, I think this current incarnation has more than run its course, so if this is to be the last one, I think they went out the right way.  I just think they could have went out the righter way with Doug Bradley on board.  In movies like Halloween and Friday the 13th, even the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series, it's ok to swap out actors for the lead slasher role, but Doug Bradley IS the face of the Hellraiser franchise--so to put a face on the DVD cover that is very obviously NOT Doug  Bradley's, that's just plain bad marketing and a sure way to guarantee NO ONE will see this thing out of anything other than morbid curiosity.  Or because, you know, they've set themselves the goal of reviewing all 9 movies in one month, but really how many people are THAT crazy?Either way, HELLRAISER: Revelations isn't the worst movie in this series, but I think they did themselves a great disservice and knowingly made it worse than it needed to be.",3,Hellraiser: Revelations,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,7584,"[""'m"", 'not',

I'll admit some remakes are awful but their are a few i've enjoyed. Doug Bradley is Pinhead just like Robert Englund is Freddy. When I saw this movie coming I knew people would be hating on it.Two college buddies go to Mexico to party and find Pinhead instead. They disappear but the camera of there adventure ends up at one of there familys home and one kid just shows up out of nowhere. Surprisingly the gore and Cenobites actually look really good in this movie. However, Pinhead is no Jackie Earle Haley and looks like some guy dressing up for Halloween. He looks like some comedian but I cant think of his name. He does deliver his lines in the vein of Doug Bradley, so that was nice.Overall, not a bad film at all.

Due to the quick turnaround time, series star Doug Bradley declined to participate, making this the first entry in the series in which he does not play Pinhead. It's also the first entry in the series since Hellraiser: Bloodline to be based on an original script, instead of incorporating series antagonist Pinhead into an unrelated horror story.The film was shot over the course of three weeks in Los Angeles for Puzzlebox Films and, sadly, it shows. Too, without Bradley's presence as Pinhead in the film, H:R looks like a cheap knock-off of the series despite the fact that it is part of the series. Stephan Smith Collins does his best to be a foreboding presence as Pinhead(with Fred Tatasciore providing the voice) but doesn't quite make the mark.Overall, though, Hellraiser: Revelations isn't as bad a movie as you'd expect it to be. Despite the time constraints in making the movie and the fact that it was made on a $300,000 budget; it was okay. Decent, even. One does wonder how it may have turned out if they had more time to plan, you know? There are far worse Hellraiser movies that have been released. I'm sure we all have our own pick. My pick would be Hellraiser: Deader. Even so, the General Public will probably pick this one due to the fact that Doug Bradley is absent from this movie.One thing I do want to touch base on. Regardless of what you might think, Hellraiser: Revelations is not a reboot/remake of the series just because someone new is playing Pinhead. I'd like to think that Dimension Films(as well as The Weinstein Company) would back a reboot/remake with alot more money as well as put in well known actors/actresses(much like they did in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street). When they do decide to reboot/remake the series, you can dang well bet that Clive Barker will be involved and they will make it one 'hell' of a movie(no pun intended).",3,Hellraiser: Revelations......,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,2300,"['Hellraiser', 'Revelations', 'fates', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'discover', 'puzzle', 'box', 'gateway', 'realm', 'inhabited', 'sadomasochistic', 'monsters', 'known', 'Cenobites.The', 'ninth', 'entry', 'Hellraiser', 'franchise', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'due', 'fact', 'due', 'obligation', 'Dimension', 'Films', 'part', 'release', 'Hellraiser', 'film', 'risk', 'losing', 'rights', 'franchise', 'Due', 'quick', 'turnaround', 'time', 'series', 'star', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'declined', 'participate', 'making', 'first', 'entry', 'series', 'not', 'play', 'Pinhead', 'also', 'first', 'entry', 'series', 'Hellraiser', 'Bloodline', 'be', 'based', 'original', 'script', 'instead', 'incorporating', 'series', 'antagonist', 'Pinhead', 'unrelated', 'horror', 'story.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'course', 'three', 'weeks', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Puzzlebox', 'Films', 'sadly', 'Too', 'Bradley', 'presence', 'Pinhead', 'film', 'H', 'R', 'cheap', 'knock-off', 'series', 'fact', 'part', 'series', 'Stephan', 'Smith', 'Collins', 'best', 'be', 'foreboding', 'presence', 'Pinhead', 'Fred', 'Tatasciore', 'providing', 'voice', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'mark.Overall', 'though', 'Hellraiser', 'Revelations', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'movie', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'time', 'constraints', 'making', 'movie', 'fact', 'was', 'made', '300,000', 'budget', 'was', 'okay', 'Decent', 'even', 'One', 'wonder', 'how', 'may', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'plan', 'know', 'are', 'far', 'worse', 'Hellraiser', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'released', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'own', 'pick', 'pick', 'would', 'be', 'Hellraiser', 'Deader', 'Even', 'so', 'General', 'Public', 'will', 'probably', 'pick', 'one', 'due', 'fact', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'absent', 'movie.One', 'thing', 'do', 'want', 'touch', 'base', 'Regardless', 'what', 'might', 'think', 'Hellraiser', 'Revelations', 'not', 'reboot/remake', 'series', 'just', 'someone', 'new', 'playing', 'Pinhead', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'Dimension', 'Films', 'as', 'well', 'Weinstein', 'Company', 'would', 'back', 'reboot/remake', 'alot', 'more', 'money', 'as', 'well', 'put', 'well', 'known', 'actors/actresses', 'much', 'did', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Friday', '13th', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'When', 'do', 'decide', 'reboot/remake', 'series', 'can', 'dang', 'well', 'bet', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'will', 'be', 'involved', 'will', 'make', 'one', ""'hell"", ""'"", 'movie', 'pun', 'intended']",N/A

Well, HELLRAISER: REVELATIONS certainly doesn't look to change that. It follows two overprivileged teens that set off to Mexico for a week of debauchery, only to discover a mysterious puzzle box that is supposed to grant the furthest reaches of human ecstasy. At home, their parents try to forget the loss of their sons, when one returns to tell them about his escape from hell. As much as Horror fans like to deny it, their villainous heroes are past their prime, and are now distant memories. Who wants to see a sagging Pinhead in his late 50's still tormenting souls? Though few embrace the recent rash of remakes, this is the time to replace starring villains, not in pathetic sequels that make mockeries of the characters. It is not that Stephan Smith Collins is terrible in the role (although highly forgettable), but more the case that the film, itself, is abhorring to the senses. REVELATIONS comes desperately close to TROLL 2 in terms of unnatural dialog and wooden performances, which is a fate worse than death for any serious horror film. Though packed with gore, it is impossible to get past the idiotic characters and mind-numbing script.

Rossi,"[0, 0]","This may be the first of the Hellraiser films to not feature Doug Bradley as pinhead, but that is not really what seems to plague Hellraiser Revelations so badly. Revelations seems less like a sequel and more of an attempt at a reboot, and as we know of most reboots, they don't always end up satisfying you.What leads me to believe that this is more of a reboot is the similarity in loose plot points to the original film. In the original, we have a recently married woman not entirely happy with her fate after having slept with her husband's brother hours before the wedding. In Revelations its a pair of unhappy, spoiled teen best friends who decide that they need to escape.The depth of Clive Barker's writing was said to have been barely hinted at in the original film, and having read the book I can believe that. And if the original Hellraiser film, largely celebrated as one of the greatest psychological terror fests even rendered on celluloid, was said to come up short in the way that most book to film adaptations usually do, what does it say about this botched reboot? Well, quite a bit actually.Had you never experienced the original Hellraiser or knew of Pinhead and the Cenobites' existence, you might be inclined to look past the thin attempts at acting in Revelations and see a pretty decent horror film. It does have the Hellraiser series' gift of gore, but as we know, its not JUST the gore that makes for spending a good time with Pinhead and company.The bonds of love and the joining of exquisite torment and absolute agony and all the metaphors within those confines are lost in Revelations and instead we have two teen boys and Pinhead going thru the motions, repeating similar lines from the original film, even trading skin just as in the original, with none of the visceral character development that made the original film such a riveting tale to watch unfold.For example, it's just not as conceivable that a friend would kill to give blood to his friend who was trapped in the cenobytes' realm and now skinlessly returned. Not without some motivation, which Revelations gives us none of. In the original film, Julia would do ANYthing for Frank because of her love beyond lust for him. These two kids in Revelations....What's their story beyond needing to leave their suburban lives behind? We are told nothing more than a tale of infidelity between their parents (Hence the title 'Revelations') which SHOULD add up to resentment toward one another, not an unbreakable bond for no reason. In fact, properly exploring THAT path between the characters would have proved to be a much more believable plot.Even the vagrant comes off as an incomplete character despite being given more attention than any of the other films ever did.The problem is that Hellraiser is not just another mindless hack and slash film. It's supposed to be the thinking person's horror film, and that's what the makers of Revelations seem to have forgotten. They know the nuts and bolts of the gross moments of the original film, and they seem content on delivering only that.In light of what's REALLY wrong with Revelations, Stephan Smith Collins playing a just adequate Pinhead is the last thing that should be focused on when filmmakers go to work on the next Hellraiser sequel.

In fact, this is so much better than any of the garbage Rick Bota directed (HELLSEEKER, DEADER, HELLWORLD) that I'm surprised at the fan reaction. This one actually bothers to take the HELLRAISER mythology seriously and to me, it seems like a return to form.  The make-up and gore effects actually manage to be above average.  The musical score is at times reminscent of the original.  The two lead actors,  Nick Eversman and Jay Gillespie are generally pretty good.  The lighting design for the Cenobite sequences looks quite authentic.  The film retains the mood of the original HELLRAISER films and there are several clever nods to the original in this one.  Of course the elephant in the room is the lack of Doug Bradly as Pinhead.  He is replaced by Stephan Smith Collins (although apparently this isn't his voice in the film - Pinhead is voiced by Fred Tatasciore) and he fills the horror icons shoes much better than Jackie Earl Haley in the awful NIGHTMARE remake or the guy (whose name escapes me) who did Jason in the equally awful FRIDAY remake.  In fact I would say that this new HELLRAISER film is far better than the average horror remake coming out these days.  With all of the good stuff said, there are plenty of flaws in this film.  How long can someone survive a gunshot wound to the gut?  Apparently quite a long time as Steven Brand (who inexplicably gets top billing in this thing) spends nearly half the film with his guts hanging out.  Why are the mothers and sister of the two lead boys dressed as prostitutes?  Why didn't they hire someone to play the Vagabond character who could act?  Honestly the film isn't a total trainwreck but it certainly will not do anything to improve the reputation of this franchise that has suffered so badly since it fell into the paws of the Weinsteins who of course could care less about the quality of anything they produce as long as they can make money from it (and the fact that they have flushed their entire fortune down the toilet more than once only to remake it with a lucky break dosen't say much for them). And who can blame them for wanting money...but they are not interested in film ... they are merely business men and this is what happens to a cool little independent series when the business guys are in complete control of it.  This isn't the worst of the bunch by a long shot, DEADER deserves that spot followed closely by HELLWORLD.

1444242,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B0056P6SOG,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[4, 4]","The Hellraiser movie series used to be one of my favorite franchises. The story-lines, the shadowy cinematography, the costume designs, and the bloody special effects were some of the elements that engaged me perfectly. The entertaining atmosphere of the films was a combination of fear, horror, and erotica, and it kept on working for me.Until Hellraiser: Revelations put the final nail in the coffin that Deader and Hellworld had lined up for the franchise.Synopsis:A couple of guys, Steven and Nico,  run off to Tijuana because they're bored with their pampered lives and want to go see a donkey show. They decide to bring a camera along to film the events. Luckily, this isn't one of those amateur camcorder movies, although it does seem like it through the first few minutes of the movie. If you're like me and get a headache from such movies, bear with it.While in Tijuana, they meet a homeless guy who gives them our old friend, the Lament Configuration. Upon opening it, and thanks to amateur camcorder footage, we see a very portly Pinhead come on-screen. We then learn that we've been watching a video with Steven's mother on the camcorder it was shot on, and the boys have disappeared.Luckily, the box came with the video camera in Steven's bag, and his not so little sister, Emma, opens it briefly, apparently just long enough for Steven to get out. Or did he? All is revealed as Steven's parents and Nico's parents get together for a missing-persons anniversary full of pain and drama that most of us Hellraiser fans would like to forget.Let us start with what was good about this movie:1) Tracey Fairaway as Emma Craven was some decent eye candy in this mess of a movie. While the incestuous plot device with her brother Steven was an odd nod to the morbid sexiness between Frank and Julia in the original Hellraiser, it didn't seem overly forced. This helped give Revelations a ""feast of flesh"" theme that could have been so much more, if it wasn't so brief and haphazard.2) Trace Fairaway as Emma Craven was the only decent thing about this movie, enough to say it again.Now for the bad:1) Fat Pinhead, played by Stephan Smith Collins, seemed to be a caricature of Doug Bradley's Pinhead. With a $300,000 production budget and quick filming, this casting was destined to be doomed without Bradley, but to find such a polar opposite was ridiculous.2) Pinhead Jr. just added to the caricature of the whole movie. To give it credit, the way Pinhead Jr. was created seemed plausible: he lost his skin, and wanted it back. Fat Pinhead nailed his flesh to his face: mission accomplished. The problem is that even that slim, sensible horror is lost, because there has already been a Pinhead. It was always interesting to see the way new cenobites were created from their own vices, even if it was a walking CD player with a head. This time around, I felt cheated.3) The story-line was muddled, at best, throwing in random lust scenarios into a top-heavy lust scenario that had already been done repeatedly in the series. This time, it was done the worst ever. Add the randomness of Steven's return (*SPOILER* How did he get captured by the cenobites the second time? Or, did he coincidentally show up when Emma opens the box?), a ""tell-all"" reason to why Nico is such an ass at the end that was a throwaway theme, and an open ending that makes us fear for the sequel, and we are given the most nonsensical Hellraiser story ever created.4) Death by getting your face peeled all seems boring the third time it is done...in the same movie.5) Nothing is revealed, except the idea that The Weinstein Company rushed this movie through so that their rights to the franchise wouldn't expire.After this mess of a movie, I welcome the Hellraiser remake, and that is not something I ever say lightly.I give this movie 1 out of 5 Pinhead face-palms. Even if the film is for free on-demand, don't bother. It's better to think this film had never been born.",1,Latest Hellraiser Has Fearful Revelation,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,3952,"['Hellraiser', 'movie', 'series', 'used', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'franchises', 'story-lines', 'shadowy', 'cinematography', 'costume', 'designs', 'bloody', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'elements', 'engaged', 'perfectly', 'entertaining', 'atmosphere', 'films', 'was', 'combination', 'fear', 'horror', 'erotica', 'kept', 'working', 'me.Until', 'Hellraiser', 'Revelations', 'put', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'Deader', 'Hellworld', 'had', 'lined', 'up', 'franchise.Synopsis', 'couple', 'guys', 'Steven', 'Nico', 'run', 'off', 'Tijuana', ""'re"", 'bored', 'pampered', 'lives', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'donkey', 'show', 'decide', 'bring', 'camera', 'film', 'events', 'Luckily', ""n't"", 'one', 'amateur', 'camcorder', 'movies', 'seem', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', ""'re"", 'get', 'headache', 'such', 'movies', 'bear', 'it.While', 'Tijuana', 'meet', 'homeless', 'guy', 'who', 'old', 'friend', 'Lament', 'Configuration', 'opening', 'thanks', 'amateur', 'camcorder', 'footage', 'see', 'very', 'portly', 'Pinhead', 'come', 'on-screen', 'then', 'learn', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'video', 'Steven', 'mother', 'camcorder', 'was', 'shot', 'boys', 'have', 'disappeared.Luckily', 'box', 'came', 'video', 'camera', 'Steven', 'bag', 'not', 'so', 'little', 'sister', 'Emma', 'briefly', 'apparently', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'Steven', 'get', 'out', 'did', 'revealed', 'Steven', 'parents', 'Nico', 'parents', 'get', 'together', 'missing-persons', 'anniversary', 'full', 'pain', 'drama', 'most', 'Hellraiser', 'fans', 'would', 'like', 'forget.Let', 'start', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'movie:1', 'Tracey', 'Fairaway', 'Emma', 'Craven', 'was', 'decent', 'eye', 'candy', 'mess', 'movie', 'incestuous', 'plot', 'device', 'brother', 'Steven', 'was', 'odd', 'nod', 'morbid', 'sexiness', 'Frank', 'Julia', 'original', 'Hellraiser', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'overly', 'forced', 'helped', 'give', 'Revelations', 'feast', 'flesh', 'theme', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'brief', 'haphazard.2', 'Trace', 'Fairaway', 'Emma', 'Craven', 'was', 'only', 'decent', 'thing', 'movie', 'enough', 'say', 'again.Now', 'bad:1', 'Fat', 'Pinhead', 'played', 'Stephan', 'Smith', 'Collins', 'seemed', 'be', 'caricature', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'Pinhead', '300,000', 'production', 'budget', 'quick', 'filming', 'casting', 'was', 'destined', 'be', 'doomed', 'Bradley', 'find', 'such', 'polar', 'opposite', 'was', 'ridiculous.2', 'Pinhead', 'Jr.', 'just', 'added', 'caricature', 'whole', 'movie', 'give', 'credit', 'way', 'Pinhead', 'Jr.', 'was', 'created', 'seemed', 'plausible', 'lost', 'skin', 'wanted', 'back', 'Fat', 'Pinhead', 'nailed', 'flesh', 'face', 'mission', 'accomplished', 'problem', 'even', 'slim', 'sensible', 'horror', 'lost', 'already', 'been', 'Pinhead', 'was', 'always', 'interesting', 'see', 'way', 'new', 'cenobites', 'were', 'created', 'own', 'vices', 'even', 'was', 'walking', 'CD', 'player', 'head', 'time', 'felt', 'cheated.3', 'story-line', 'was', 'muddled', 'best', 'throwing', 'random', 'lust', 'scenarios', 'top-heavy', 'lust', 'scenario', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'repeatedly', 'series', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'worst', 'ever', 'Add', 'randomness', 'Steven', 'return', '*SPOILER*', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'captured', 'cenobites', 'second', 'time', 'did', 'coincidentally', 'show', 'up', 'when', 'Emma', 'box', 'tell-all', 'reason', 'why', 'Nico', 'such', 'ass', 'end', 'was', 'throwaway', 'theme', 'open', 'ending', 'fear', 'sequel', 'are', 'given', 'most', 'nonsensical', 'Hellraiser', 'story', 'ever', 'Death', 'getting', 'face', 'peeled', 'boring', 'third', 'time', 'done', 'same', 'movie.5', 'Nothing', 'revealed', 'idea', 'Weinstein', 'Company', 'rushed', 'movie', 'so', 'rights', 'franchise', 'would', ""n't"", 'expire.After', 'mess', 'movie', 'welcome', 'Hellraiser', 'remake', 'not', 'something', 'ever', 'say', 'lightly.I', 'give', 'movie', '1', '5', 'Pinhead', 'face-palms', 'Even', 'film', 'free', 'on-demand', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'better', 'think', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born']",N/A
1444243,A2PTPOUABGG8K2,B0056P6SOG,JaneDoeFailedMe,"[2, 2]","Now, will you take my opinion with a grain of salt because I will right off the bat declare myself a Hellraiser fanboy? Probably. I'm just getting that out of the way for you. I love the first seven entries in the series and this film actually makes the 8th look tolerable.It's been well documented, that the Hellraiser series has been declining since the Marques de Sade-esque 4th film, ""Bloodline"". However, both 5 and 6 to me were highly enjoyable even if they weren't originally Hellraiser scripts. This is most likely due to Bradleys performances, as they are the one consistent (ti'll now) of the films. However, I think that is enough about the past......You could say that the reason this film is terrible, is simply because it was rushed and filmed with a small budget and a short time period. In fact, that would be a pretty good reason. However, look at ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or the first ""Saw"" film. Both rushed and under budget and those have reached their own high level of respect in the genre. So lets face it, the script is poor, the actors make no connection with their audience and faux Pinhead is an insult to the brilliant mind of Clive Barker and the acting of Doug Bradley.Clive and Doug had a working relationship in acting/play wright troupes throughout their younger years, they understood each other and more importantly their craft. That is what makes the film/icon stand the test of time. The characters were believably flawed. This is relevant to the review for the 9th entry in the Hellraiser saga because this film represents none of that. This was a rush job to keep the rites to the film for a longer time. Those involved in this film could care less about the legacy of this film or its fan base. To rise from the ruin that has been the last ten years for this series, you need to go back to the root values and emotions that it invoked in its audience.Plus, the lead cenobite was always played with this high sense of arrogance, knowledge and a pitiful look at people and their lack of understanding when it came to pleasure and suffering. The character who portrays Pinhead here doesn't seem to take this into the role and treats it as you would some average sociopath. This throws the story off the axis that is the Hellraiser world. Not only that but the acting is so poor in this film, it makes the last few entries look award winning in fact. You'd think actors would be well versed and knowledgable on a series if they were entering it into the 9th film, yet this doesn't appear to be the case.To sum it up, this is a rush job of a film which takes the modern day/cliche take on horror of teenagers acting stupid and finding trouble, with a poor excuse for something that may have once been a genius idea from the twisted mind of Clive Barker. i respect everything Barker has done but signing his rites away to the film so early on in the series just sucks in the most face palm of ways. This movie is an all too good example of such. Maybe, there would be a writer, director and set of actors who could make at the least a respectable Hellraiser film without the titans of the first film but I can say with all the confidence in the world that NONODY involved in this film are those people.",1,"Your suffering will be legendary, even in movie obscurity.",1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,3237,"['Now', 'will', 'take', 'opinion', 'grain', 'salt', 'will', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'declare', 'Hellraiser', 'fanboy', 'Probably', ""'m"", 'just', 'getting', 'way', 'love', 'first', 'seven', 'entries', 'series', 'film', 'actually', '8th', 'look', 'tolerable.It', 'been', 'well', 'documented', 'Hellraiser', 'series', 'been', 'declining', 'Marques', 'Sade-esque', '4th', 'film', 'Bloodline', 'However', '5', '6', 'were', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'originally', 'Hellraiser', 'scripts', 'most', 'likely', 'due', 'Bradleys', 'performances', 'are', 'one', 'consistent', 'ti', ""'ll"", 'now', 'films', 'However', 'think', 'enough', 'past', 'could', 'say', 'reason', 'film', 'terrible', 'simply', 'was', 'rushed', 'filmed', 'small', 'budget', 'short', 'time', 'period', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'reason', 'However', 'look', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'first', 'Saw', 'film', 'rushed', 'budget', 'have', 'reached', 'own', 'high', 'level', 'respect', 'genre', 'So', 'face', 'script', 'poor', 'actors', 'make', 'connection', 'audience', 'faux', 'Pinhead', 'insult', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'acting', 'Doug', 'Bradley.Clive', 'Doug', 'had', 'working', 'relationship', 'acting/play', 'wright', 'troupes', 'younger', 'years', 'understood', 'other', 'more', 'importantly', 'craft', 'film/icon', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'characters', 'were', 'believably', 'flawed', 'relevant', 'review', '9th', 'entry', 'Hellraiser', 'saga', 'film', 'none', 'was', 'rush', 'job', 'keep', 'rites', 'film', 'longer', 'time', 'involved', 'film', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'legacy', 'film', 'fan', 'base', 'rise', 'ruin', 'been', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'series', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'root', 'values', 'emotions', 'invoked', 'audience.Plus', 'lead', 'cenobite', 'was', 'always', 'played', 'high', 'sense', 'arrogance', 'knowledge', 'pitiful', 'look', 'people', 'lack', 'understanding', 'when', 'came', 'pleasure', 'suffering', 'character', 'who', 'Pinhead', 'here', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'role', 'would', 'average', 'sociopath', 'story', 'axis', 'Hellraiser', 'world', 'Not', 'only', 'acting', 'so', 'poor', 'film', 'last', 'few', 'entries', 'look', 'award', 'winning', 'fact', ""'d"", 'think', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'versed', 'knowledgable', 'series', 'were', 'entering', '9th', 'film', 'yet', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'case.To', 'sum', 'up', 'rush', 'job', 'film', 'modern', 'day/cliche', 'take', 'horror', 'teenagers', 'acting', 'stupid', 'finding', 'trouble', 'poor', 'excuse', 'something', 'may', 'have', 'once', 'been', 'genius', 'idea', 'twisted', 'mind', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'i', 'respect', 'everything', 'Barker', 'done', 'signing', 'rites', 'away', 'film', 'so', 'early', 'series', 'just', 'sucks', 'most', 'face', 'palm', 'ways', 'movie', 'all', 'too', 'good', 'example', 'such', 'Maybe', 'would', 'be', 'writer', 'director', 'set', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'least', 'respectable', 'Hellraiser', 'film', 'titans', 'first', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'confidence', 'world', 'NONODY', 'involved', 'film', 'are', 'people']",N/A

I know it's been over a decade since I saw the first two Hellraiser movies, but I seem to remember enough to know something's happened since then. That or the storytellers gave up on originality and fresh starts. What's wrong? Hm... it seems like there's really nothing right in this movie. The dialogue, for starters, is entirely redundant with really no true revelations, pointless chewouts, illogical rebuttals, etc.(Spoiler! Who shoots someone with a shotgun then tells their worried wife that it's nothing and the wife obeys with less concern? End spoiler)The violence... well, in the 80's horror movies (alongside Hellraiser), the violence was good at getting me to cringe and wince because it wasn't only special effects, but had meaning behind it. This simply felt like a downfall. Pretty much every single ounce of blood was an eye-roller since it couldn't convince it was ""realistic"" in any sense, let alone when people got their skin torn off (or peeled off, which looked like a tasteless joke).The story? Yeah, a disjointed tale of two best friends recording their journey into Mexico to escape the brutal expectations of living in high-priced families only to lose everything (including car, yet not the camera) and get told how to experience unending pleasure, only to open the franchise's infamous box and its resident, only for one of them to die and the other trying to get him back? Part of that feels like a rip-off while the other feels like a cure for insomnia.Sexual content? Another staple of the franchise is dumbed-down and shown in dissappointing fashion. Nothing in it seemed to get me interested in the slightest.

I read that it this was written as a H  e  l  l raiser movie but I don't see it I just see another attempt to cash in & use the name. Dimension & The Weinstien's especially The Weinstein's were going to lose the rights & they still want to do a remake so lets make a sequel. This movie feels like Scream mixed with H  e  l  l raiser mixed with a found footage movie. Directed by Victor Garcia he hasn't directed anything of note to me. It stars Steven Smith Collins as Pinhead this time. Jay Gillspie as Nico, Nick Eversman as Steven & Tracey Fairaway as Emma. The movie starts off like a found footage film which I hate those. These 2 guys Steven & Nico are going to Mexico to party Steven I guess killed a p  r  o s  t  it  u  t e. Some bum gives them the box & Steven opens it Pinhead comes out & he gets owned. Nico has been woudering around & Steven has been using him to kill so he can regain his skin. A year later the families of the 2 missing boys have a dinner in there memory Steven's Sister Emma wants to know what happend. Nico shows up & well there happy about that. We get a bunch of shock horror tatics cause nobody knows what good horror is today I'll get on that in another rant. Steven  basically did to Nico what Frank did to Larry from the 1st movie. Oh & when you open the box now it causes Earthquakes wtf!? Everybody finds out that it's Steven with an ending that feels straight out of Scream. The series ended at part IV & this was made out of greed . I saw a video on You  t  u  be where Doug Bradley said Dimension are a bunch of idiots they want to continue making money off of established franchises. He said if the 1st movie was never made & you went to the offices of Dimension tommarrow & pitched Clive Barker's novel & say hey lets try & make this into a movie it would be immeditly rejected. Why didn't they do Michael Myers vs Pinhead those franchises were long over even if it was bad as A  V  p it would be better than what's happend to both series of movies. Victor Garcia did a really bad job directing Steven Smith Collins he didn't do as bad as a job as Jackie Earle Hayley did as Freddy but he still is terrible as Pinhead.

It's true he turned down the part because he felt like the movie was being rushed.

Their was no way you could watch it until the disk was in your hand. Not fair.I have a lot of love and a little hate for this movie. I will be honest it had flaws. But first lets go over all the positives.1) Story was captivating and had a lot of good twists to add a wow factor. Story 4.5 Stars.2) All the ""HUMAN"" Actors were very good in their roles. I honestly have never seen any of these actors before, but they came off seasoned rather than straight from acting 101. Acting 4 Stars.3) Female version of Chatterer Cenobite - A great BonusNow here are the negatives.Sadly No Doug Bradley. (Something All the Haters use to trash this movie)But You Need to Realize that Doug Bradley Has Repeatedly Told Interviewers and fans HE was the one who turned down the Role when they told him the budget and time constraints of the production.Sad also is because this was low budget, Pinhead Didn't look as cool. PinHead was actually acted by 2 actors (Kinda like Darth Vader only not as cool).The Voice actor was honestly bad. I did not enjoy him speaking. The actor who was visually filmed was not bad though. His facial structure was great. The problem is The makeup was poorly done compared to when Doug Bradley was Brushed up. Also in previous films with Doug... when you looked at the PINS in his head you were always like ""How the hell did they get them so close."" But in this movie the pin application was poor and the pins were much farther apart than normal. But again Shoe string budget.other negative were problems with the mythology and story of Hellraiser itself. The Basic Premise was great but they screwed up a few things.First and biggest...It was established in the first 2 movies Someone could come back from the dead, but only if blood came into contact with the spot they died. (1st movie was the floor and 2nd was the mattress the woman died on.In this movie someone comes back when blood is spilled in a totally different place then where they were taken by the cenobites. That's breaking the rules of the reality.Second...Who ever was in control of the scenes where the puzzle box is used didn't know their stuff. the actors were not circling their fingers in the right direction and the puzzle box opened and closed before the cenobites even arrived...twiceThird...I won't spoil who it is...but one of the main characters kinda turns into a Pinhead Jr / Pinhead LiteHe was creepy and the idea was kinda cool but I wasn't totally sold on the idea.Beside that overall this movie is greatNow considering this movie was rushed and made in like 2 weeks with only $300,000 dollars (Chump change in the movie biz)I Find this movie Deserves a Watch from every Hellraiser Fan or Fan of Good Horror.",4,Why you should love this movie with a grain of salt,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,3071,"['posting', 'review', 'read', 'almost', '1', '2', 'star', 'reviews', 'noticed', '85', 'percent', 'were', 'posted', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'released', 'rest', 'Just', 'said', 'No', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'Pinhead', 'Equals', 'Horrible', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Amazon', 'Allows', 'People', 'who', 'positively', 'Never', 'saw', 'movie', 'ruin', 'reputation.This', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'theaters', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'watch', 'disk', 'was', 'hand', 'Not', 'fair.I', 'have', 'lot', 'love', 'little', 'hate', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'honest', 'had', 'flaws', 'first', 'lets', 'go', 'positives.1', 'Story', 'was', 'captivating', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'twists', 'add', 'wow', 'factor', 'Story', '4.5', 'Stars.2', 'HUMAN', 'Actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'honestly', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'actors', 'came', 'off', 'seasoned', 'rather', 'straight', 'acting', '101', 'Acting', '4', 'Stars.3', 'Female', 'version', 'Chatterer', 'Cenobite', 'great', 'BonusNow', 'here', 'are', 'negatives.Sadly', 'No', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'Something', 'Haters', 'use', 'trash', 'movie', 'Need', 'Realize', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'Has', 'Repeatedly', 'Told', 'Interviewers', 'fans', 'HE', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'turned', 'down', 'Role', 'when', 'told', 'budget', 'time', 'constraints', 'production.Sad', 'also', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'Pinhead', 'Did', ""n't"", 'look', 'cool', 'PinHead', 'was', 'actually', 'acted', '2', 'actors', 'Kinda', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'only', 'not', 'cool', '.The', 'Voice', 'actor', 'was', 'honestly', 'bad', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'speaking', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'visually', 'filmed', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'facial', 'structure', 'was', 'great', 'problem', 'makeup', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'compared', 'when', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'was', 'Brushed', 'up', 'Also', 'previous', 'films', 'Doug', 'when', 'looked', 'PINS', 'head', 'were', 'always', 'How', 'hell', 'did', 'get', 'so', 'close', 'movie', 'pin', 'application', 'was', 'poor', 'pins', 'were', 'much', 'farther', 'apart', 'normal', 'again', 'Shoe', 'string', 'budget.other', 'negative', 'were', 'problems', 'mythology', 'story', 'Hellraiser', 'Basic', 'Premise', 'was', 'great', 'screwed', 'up', 'few', 'things.First', 'biggest', 'was', 'established', 'first', '2', 'movies', 'Someone', 'could', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'only', 'blood', 'came', 'contact', 'spot', 'died', '1st', 'movie', 'was', 'floor', '2nd', 'was', 'mattress', 'woman', 'died', 'movie', 'someone', 'back', 'when', 'blood', 'spilled', 'totally', 'different', 'place', 'then', 'where', 'were', 'taken', 'cenobites', 'breaking', 'rules', 'reality.Second', 'Who', 'ever', 'was', 'control', 'scenes', 'where', 'puzzle', 'box', 'used', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'stuff', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'circling', 'fingers', 'right', 'direction', 'puzzle', 'box', 'opened', 'closed', 'cenobites', 'even', 'arrived', 'twiceThird', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'who', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'kinda', 'Pinhead', 'Jr', '/', 'Pinhead', 'LiteHe', 'was', 'creepy', 'idea', 'was', 'kinda', 'cool', 'was', ""n't"", 'totally', 'sold', 'idea.Beside', 'overall', 'movie', 'greatNow', 'considering', 'movie', 'was', 'rushed', 'made', 'like', '2', 'weeks', 'only', '300,000', 'dollars', 'Chump', 'change', 'movie', 'biz', 'Find', 'movie', 'Watch', 'Hellraiser', 'Fan', 'Fan', 'Good', 'Horror']",N/A

I remember watching the first Hellraiser back when it first came out (yea, Mom and Dad allowed me to watch whatever I wanted... SO WHAT?!?!). Hellraiser changed the horror genre... and Doug Bradley made PINHEAD an icon.So... no Doug Bradley as Pinhead in this one.Crap.That right away turns me off. I don't like not having him in the iconic role of the lead cenobite. With that said... it took me a while to come to terms with Doug not being a part of this movie... so I didn't watch it.Well, a few weeks ago I saw it was added to Netflix and I decided, ""ok, it's time I just get this painful thing over with""... and I added it to my queue.I would choose EASTER SUNDAY to watch a horror movie (LOL).The plot was extremely similar in many ways to the first Hellraiser movie. I don't want to give away the plot or any story aspects because in the Hellraiser series, the tiniest little bit of information usually makes the difference. Needless to say, I found nothing wrong with the plot in general. If anything, I was really pleased that the STORY was a sort of backtrack to the original format of what Hellraiser was.The acting... some were VERY good actors... some, not so much. Jay Gillespie was ok. I had seen him before in the remake of 2001 Maniacs with Robert Englund. I liked him in that movie but I didn't much care for him in this one. He seems a little OFF his game. Nick Eversman as Steven was really the star of this whole movie. He could turn his character on a dime and in a Hellraiser movie, that's what is needed. I was VERY impressed with him. Everyone else, just filler in my opinion.The cenobites looked awesome as usual... a female chatterer, a few other female cenobites, then we get to the NEW PINHEAD... Stephan Smith Collins. Well... he's no Doug Bradley. And I found myself rather BORED with his version of Pinhead. He wasn't as cool and smooth as Doug in the role. He didn't have that twisted demon presence either. However, I will say he stood tall... and looked the part (mostly due to great people doing great makeup) but otherwise, his Pinhead wouldn't last 2 seconds with Doug Bradley's Pinhead in any showdown.Is this a good Hellraiser?No.Is it worth seeing?Yes.If you are a fan of the Hellraiser series and have seen all the Hellraisers so far, sitting through Revelations isn't going to hurt you one damn bit... in fact it might make you nostalgic for the first Hellraiser... and if you sat through DEADER and/or INFERNO.... you can stomach this one which is better than those two COMBINED.Hellraiser Revelations isn't the BEST of the Hellraiser series but it isn't the worst...it depends on what you're looking for.SO WHAT'S YOUR PLEASURE?",2,Not bad but not great either.,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,2714,"['Now', 'am', 'fan', 'Hellraiser', 'series', 'remember', 'watching', 'first', 'Hellraiser', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'yea', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'allowed', 'watch', 'wanted', 'SO', 'WHAT', 'Hellraiser', 'changed', 'horror', 'genre', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'made', 'PINHEAD', 'icon.So', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'Pinhead', 'right', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'not', 'having', 'iconic', 'role', 'lead', 'cenobite', 'said', 'took', 'while', 'come', 'terms', 'Doug', 'not', 'being', 'part', 'movie', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'it.Well', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'saw', 'was', 'added', 'Netflix', 'decided', 'ok', 'time', 'just', 'get', 'painful', 'thing', 'added', 'queue.I', 'would', 'choose', 'EASTER', 'SUNDAY', 'watch', 'horror', 'movie', 'LOL', '.The', 'plot', 'was', 'extremely', 'similar', 'many', 'ways', 'first', 'Hellraiser', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'story', 'aspects', 'Hellraiser', 'series', 'tiniest', 'little', 'bit', 'information', 'usually', 'difference', 'Needless', 'say', 'found', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'plot', 'general', 'anything', 'was', 'really', 'pleased', 'STORY', 'was', 'sort', 'backtrack', 'original', 'format', 'what', 'Hellraiser', 'was.The', 'acting', 'were', 'VERY', 'good', 'actors', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Jay', 'Gillespie', 'was', 'ok', 'had', 'seen', 'remake', '2001', 'Maniacs', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'liked', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'one', 'little', 'OFF', 'game', 'Nick', 'Eversman', 'Steven', 'was', 'really', 'star', 'whole', 'movie', 'could', 'turn', 'character', 'dime', 'Hellraiser', 'movie', 'what', 'needed', 'was', 'VERY', 'impressed', 'Everyone', 'else', 'just', 'filler', 'opinion.The', 'cenobites', 'looked', 'awesome', 'usual', 'female', 'chatterer', 'few', 'other', 'female', 'cenobites', 'then', 'get', 'NEW', 'PINHEAD', 'Stephan', 'Smith', 'Collins', 'Well', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'found', 'rather', 'BORED', 'version', 'Pinhead', 'was', ""n't"", 'cool', 'smooth', 'Doug', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'twisted', 'demon', 'presence', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'stood', 'tall', 'looked', 'part', 'mostly', 'due', 'great', 'people', 'doing', 'great', 'makeup', 'otherwise', 'Pinhead', 'would', ""n't"", 'last', '2', 'seconds', 'Doug', 'Bradley', 'Pinhead', 'showdown.Is', 'good', 'Hellraiser', 'No.Is', 'seeing', 'Yes.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Hellraiser', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'Hellraisers', 'so', 'far', 'sitting', 'Revelations', ""n't"", 'going', 'hurt', 'one', 'damn', 'bit', 'fact', 'might', 'make', 'nostalgic', 'first', 'Hellraiser', 'sat', 'DEADER', 'and/or', 'INFERNO', 'can', 'stomach', 'one', 'better', 'two', 'COMBINED.Hellraiser', 'Revelations', ""n't"", 'BEST', 'Hellraiser', 'series', ""n't"", 'worst', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'for.SO', 'WHAT', 'YOUR', 'PLEASURE']",N/A

It's also the first film in the series since 3 that is an original screenplay, as opposed to being adapted from an unrelated horror story, but originality does not save it.The film sees two wealthy teenagers, Nico and Steven, head to Mexico for a week of debauchery. After Nico kills a prostitute he accepts the gift of a puzzle box, believing that the Cenobites it releases will allow him to experience ultimate pleasure. Predictably he is unhappy with the results, but Steven ends up belonging more to the Pinhead school of thought than he expected. After Steven apparently returns home, the boys' families find themselves isolated in their desert house as the Cenobites return to reclaim a soul that has escaped them...Revelations fails in basically every way it possible could. It is shot entirely in syfy channel wobbly cam, the music lacks all the dramatic oomph of the previous films, and the whole plot is rote and predictable to the point that nobody who has seen the earlier films will be surprised by any of it. The actors phone in every line, including whoever plays Pinhead (Doug Bradley wisely steered clear of this dookie). The result is a movie that is more camp than scary- Pinhead cuts a house's phone lines? Really? And the cenobites in general seem more like generic slasher movie baddies than the gothic archfiends they were in earlier installments.I personally recommend stopping your Hellraiser viewing with 2, but even if you've stuck out the later installments, skip this drek.

One of the friends is actually pretty wierd, freaky-he might make fans think of what would-you quess it-make a good cenobite. But he is even stranger than that, and in fact is sort of a pin-head lookalike. The idea ""switching someone else out"" is what is the real dealer though, bringing in the entire family of the two friends.

Yes Doug Bradly is not in this and yes the budget is very very small. These two things have seriously hampered a very good script. 2nd thing is that I was well aware of the controversy with this movie before I got involved in this, so I went it expecting a trainwreck. Watching this movie was very frustrating because it really is the best hellraiser story in years(not counting the recent comic books from BOOM. Major props to Gary Tunniclife for doing double duty as the makeup effects designer and writer. It really is amazing that it looks as good as it does considering it was such a rushed production. The new Pinhead is difficult to judge because for one thing his voice has been dubbed over. The biggest problem with the new guy is his facial structure. Many of people have called him fat or chubby but thats not really the case. He just has a very strong jaw that does not fit Pinhead at all, not to mention that he is very baby faced. The biggest problem with this movie is not in the cast and crew who I think did the best that they could do under the circumstances, the problem really is with the weinstein company. I truly hate the weinsteins with a passion, they have been sitting on this franchise for years insulting the true fans by pushing out DTV drivel every few years and milking it for all its worth. The sad thing is that in previous years they would take already existing scripts and then convert them into hellraiser scripts by sprinkling pinhead at random points. Bottomline, best hellraiser script in years and I hate to say it but I really enjoyed this movie more than the last 3.

1444267,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0056P6SOG,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Hellraiser: Revelations (Victor Garcia, 2011)I've been having a little fun going through Dread Central's worst movies of 2011 lists and checking out the stuff that showed up on multiple lists. I was not nearly as disappointed with Creature as that lot were, but they were dead on the money with Hellraiser: Revelations, a movie so ridiculous that even Doug Bradley, who's been using the Hellraiser series as his primary income for decades, jumped ship.It's a ridiculous rehash of the first film; they might well have done better to just call it a reboot and have done with it. But Garcia (Return to House on Haunted Hill) and screenwrtier Gary Tunnicliffe (Megalodon--but more worth noting is that he's been part of the SFX team on various Hellraiser films since the third, as well as Barker's own film Lord of Illusions) took the events of the first film and couched them in an inept mystery about the disappearance of two college-age friends in Mexico (who, of course, opened the box and summoned Pinhead, now played by Everything Must Go's Stephan Smith Collins, and his playmates--even including a new version of the chattering cenobite, now female).And hey, Victor and Gary, can we talk about that? Because even in the crappiest Hellraiser sequels so far (which is, really, everything from the third movie on, and even the second really wasn't any great shakes), one of the very few things we looked forward to was at least some sort of inventiveness, creativity, irony, or even stupidity in the new cenobites that were sure to appear. And what did we get this time? [SPOILER ALERT!] A rehashed chatterer and ""Pseudo-Pinhead""? Come on, are you SERIOUS? [/SPOILER ALERT]You are, I am sure, as painfully aware as I am that the inevitable reboot of the franchise is eventually coming. (IMDB says there's one in development, but no details are listed yet. Empire Online, terrifyingly, are strongly insinuating that Dimension is trying to make the movie franchise that has always pushed the hard_r boundary to its limits into a PG-13 franchise this go-round. But here's the question you have to mull over: is it even remotely possible that even a PG-13 remake could be worse than Hellraiser: Revelations? I dread the actual answer to this question, because the odds that the answer is ""yes"" are at leas a thousand to one... but they're not zero. How awful a concept is that?

The next thing you know their car is jacked, then they are opening the puzzle box. Pinhead appears. Now I understand real people age and in hell they don't so they needed another pinhead. But if you are going to have someone speak monotone lines and sound odious, you must use voice enhancements, like they do in low budget films. There are times when both guys are being filmed at the same time and you have to ask why is the camera still jerking around? Now I can't remember the last Hellraiser I saw, was it the corporate one or the thing in outer space...or was that a Jason thing? And apparently it doesn't matter how it ties into the other films in the series.The two boys have disappeared and the sister/gf (Tracey Fairaway) is extremely interested in what happened. 10 minutes into the film I was thinking, they are going to need some good nudity to save this one, and with the first hooker still having her clothes on, I didn't hope for much. Then there are some plot points I am confused about. We see Pinhead take the puzzle box, but it appears in the boy's room in his bag along with the camera they had when they went missing. How did this get back to his room from Mexico? The police saw the movie on the camera, but didn't keep it for evidence.The puzzle box is not really a puzzle as everyone seems to be able to open it. It opened once by pushing the top, a second time by twisting the corner. Could we have a little consistency? And doesn't Tracey Fairaway take showers?  The vagrant (Daniel Buran) had some of the best lines, which to say were not that great.

Hellraiser revelations may take the seat held by ""Hellworld"" as the worst of the series.They did try to at least go by the original rules of the Hellraiser films. The box, chains, cenobites, skin ripping/ wearing and abundant use of the words ""flesh"" and ""pleasure"". Sounds ok right?Unfortunately, the movie is so low budget and characters sooooo bad that it doesn't even feel like a hellraiser movie. The acting is as bad as anything i've ever seen. Ever.  No one is good, no character motivations make sense at all. And to cover how cheap this movie is, they have the characters try and explain why there are only 3 sets and 10 actors in the movie. At least they made the ""Mexico"" scenes seem authentic HAHAThey didn't use ANY of the original hellraiser muisc, which seems ridiculous. If you can afford to use all the Hellraiser lore and Pinhead.  They don't come thru the walls, they just appear in the room. Any usually deep yet terrifying words by Pinhead are replaced by generic dribble.Some of the gore is pretty good, and they didn't ruin Pinhead or the cenobites worse than anyone else has, but just about everything in this movie is just so stupid that even seeing a few chains, the box and a Fuax Pinhead barely nudge this to 1 star.",1,Could be the worst Hellraiser film ever,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,1391,"['Hellraiser', 'movies', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'First', 'two', 'are', 'true', 'horror', 'classics', 'sequels', 'follow', 'range', 'pretty', 'good', 'astonishingly', 'awful', 'Hellraiser', 'revelations', 'may', 'take', 'seat', 'held', 'Hellworld', 'worst', 'series.They', 'did', 'try', 'least', 'go', 'original', 'rules', 'Hellraiser', 'films', 'box', 'chains', 'cenobites', 'skin', 'ripping/', 'wearing', 'abundant', 'use', 'words', 'flesh', 'pleasure', 'Sounds', 'ok', 'right', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'so', 'low', 'budget', 'characters', 'sooooo', 'bad', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'hellraiser', 'movie', 'acting', 'as', 'bad', 'anything', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Ever', 'one', 'good', 'character', 'motivations', 'make', 'sense', 'cover', 'how', 'cheap', 'movie', 'have', 'characters', 'try', 'explain', 'why', 'are', 'only', '3', 'sets', '10', 'actors', 'movie', 'least', 'made', 'Mexico', 'scenes', 'seem', 'authentic', 'HAHAThey', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'ANY', 'original', 'hellraiser', 'muisc', 'ridiculous', 'can', 'afford', 'use', 'Hellraiser', 'lore', 'Pinhead', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'thru', 'walls', 'just', 'appear', 'room', 'Any', 'usually', 'deep', 'yet', 'terrifying', 'words', 'Pinhead', 'are', 'replaced', 'generic', 'dribble.Some', 'gore', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'Pinhead', 'cenobites', 'worse', 'anyone', 'else', 'just', 'everything', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'stupid', 'even', 'seeing', 'few', 'chains', 'box', 'Fuax', 'Pinhead', 'barely', 'nudge', '1', 'star']",N/A
