288441,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301978749,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Sometimes you watch a film without expectation and find yourself more than merely invested but moved by the intimate and honest nature of the film itself.  It can be one of the most rewarding experiences in life, to sit back and become pulled into the very fabric of a film, the very `being' it processes.  That happened for me last night, while I was watching `Tea and Sympathy', a little known gem from director Vincente Minnelli.  In fact, until last night I hadn't ever heard of the movie.  As a fan of Deborah Kerr, I was interested in seeing it, but I had no idea what I was about to watch and had zero expectation walking in.`Tea and Sympathy' may be one of the most powerful portraits of bullying, loneliness, tolerance and sexual identity ever put to film.Some will balk at this.  Some will say that the film is dated and that its presentation of homosexuality is stilted or false, but one also has to remember the time in which a film like this was being made.  In the 50's, it was extremely taboo to tackle these themes.  In fact, it is still to a small degree considered taboo today.  It was very hard to express sympathy or tolerance for those struggling with their own personal feelings and identity because there was very little tolerance to be found.  That is why a film like `Tea and Sympathy' is so important and so powerful.  It may not address certain issues with definite clarity (it never once mentions the word homosexual or even gay) and yet in doing such it actually speaks to a larger audience.  It makes the core theme of bullying a more universal subject, and in doing so it becomes a more powerful and more effective film.The core story is that of seventeen year-old Tom Lee.  Attending a prep school and living in a boarding house co-habited by his headmaster, Mr. Reynolds, Tom is having a very hard time fitting in.  He isn't interested in the many activities of his peers.  He doesn't want to play sports of climb mountains.  Instead, he dreams of being a folk singer and indulges in the company of women, mostly the headmaster's wife Laura.  Because of this, Tom is constantly teased by his peers.  They label him `Sister Boy', questioning his sexuality and manliness and treating him like an outcast.  They harass and terrorize him whenever possible.But Laura's life isn't so glamorous either.  Her husband, headmaster Bill, is a guarded man who treats her more like an object or property and less like a wife.  He shuns her affections and spends his free time entertaining his students, taking them on hikes and trips and inviting them to the house.  He spends no alone time with Laura and seems to be uninterested in her sexually.  Seeking affection, and desiring to give someone affection herself, Laura finds herself gravitating towards Tom, who is in desperate need of some sympathy.The film is a very bold look at the destructive nature of bullying and preconceived notions of what an individual is supposed to be.  As we look at the people around Tom and the way the react to him, we can see those same actions taking place today, which makes a film like this relevant to modern society.  In a world where bullying is becoming an even bigger problem, it is interesting to see a film made in the 50's tackling, with such brazen honesty, the downward spiral associated with the act.  As Tom's world collapses under his own frustrated depressions, we are crushed by his reality.The scene where he attempts suicide is a tragic reminder that these issues are far from `a thing of the past'.Some have taken issue with the way that homosexuality is handled here, stating that the issue is merely skirted around and that the insinuation that `walking a certain way' makes you a certain way is insulting.  I don't see it this way.  For me, the film works brilliantly within the unfair constraints and censorship of the time working against it.  There were certain aspects of the stage play that apparently couldn't be included in the film (anyone familiar with Tennessee Williams' stage plays and film adaptations should be aware that this issue was commonplace in the 40's and 50's), but I feel that the film does a marvelous job of working around that fact, allowing the meat of the story to film every frame.In not addressing the obvious directly, `Tea and Sympathy' paints a wider portrait of oppression and tolerance.  The fact remains that not every quiet boy who would rather sing than play football is gay, and the way that `Tea and Sympathy' broaches Tom's demeanor, his shyness and his uncomfortable, awkward advances towards women could honestly be something altogether NOT what one would expect.  But it is more than just Tom's experience being looked at here.  The characters of Bill and of Tom's roommate Al also color different aspects of manliness and sexual identity.  Al is painted as a sympathizer, but he is also controlled by his fear or what others may think of him.  He hesitates to do what is in his heart because he is afraid of being condemned.  But it is Bill who is the real point of interest.  His reluctance to embrace his wife speaks volumes for his abrupt masculinity, a mask he uses to shield himself from his internal torment over not `wanting to want' what he obviously wants.The character of Laura is an interesting one, because one can almost wade through her sweet sincerity to find a near selfishness, a need to find comfort and solace in her time of despair and in her final letter to Tom one can almost sense that she understands that her actions were damaging, despite appearing to be cleansing and healing on the outset.Vincente Minnelli does a masterful job of bringing awareness to a taboo subject, using a visual intensity to further cast that lot.  I found it quite jarring that throughout the entirety of the film I barely saw young John Kerr's face.  He was always so downtrodden and outwardly oppressed, but in the climactic scene in the woods with Deborah Kerr, the light came down through the trees and highlighted his face and it was almost like Minnelli was allowing us to fully grasp the boy's vindication.I don't know what else I can say.  This film touched me in a way I didn't expect, and I'm saddened that it doesn't have a larger audience.  Sure, some of the approaches may be dated, but the film is far more poignant that many give it credit for, and as a statement piece of a period behind us, it brilliantly addresses a universal problem that is still very prevalent and thus expresses concern that is still very relevant.  Whether you consider Tom, Al or Bill (or all three of them) as closeted homosexuals, `Tea and Sympathy' does a miraculous job of shading three very different men suffering from a very similar issue, that of self and social tolerance, and gives us a way of seeing three differing vantage points, all of them observed by a woman suffering from her own life obstacles.At the end of the day, `Tea and Sympathy' is a film about hurting and overcoming that hurt to finally accept oneself for who one truly is.",5,A profound look at tolerance and bullying...,1382659200,"10 25,

288442,A2ZAEYPSNXU2CM,6301978749,"Barry Mccall ""Video Grand Vizer!""","[5, 7]","I saw this movie on tv in the late 60s. It was a time when I was going through much of what the protaganist Tom Lee was going through.Its a film about being ""different"". About being bullied becauseyou are different. by friends,foes and even your family.I liked this film a lot. and hope that it will someday wind up on dvd. It may be dated by todays's films on the subject of homosexuality. (although Robert Anderson claimed that it was not about that subject per'se.)It still has a timely message on the subject of tolerance. Thatshould be watched for that message today.My only three critiques of the film are;1. that it should've been filmed word for word from the original play. (Read the play. Its more powerful than the film is.)2.That Darryl Hickman should have played the part of Tom Lee,rather that John Kerr.I agree with the other reviewers that Kerr was just too old forthe role. And Debra Kerr was as always enchanting in the role of Laura Reynolds. Leif Ericson, as the headmaster of Tom's dorm was in my opinion also a little too old for his part.His part should have gone to a younger man in his late twenties or very early thirties. Because its implied in the play that Bill Reynolds, may be a latent homosexual who married Laura for cover! It was, and sill is a common pratice today.As for that last scene? Well I know I have changed thatscene a thousand times since I watched it. I leave it to you todo the same!I re-read my review of Tea Sympathy. and I have re-watched my now fading vhs copy. ( Please will whomever owns the distribution rights to this very touching film,re-release it on dvd before the last of it's stars passes on. So that we can have an actor from the film, commentary in the dvd extras on it.)For the most part, I stand by my review. But I will change one part of it. The film is not about homosexuality. I used the term per'se. that was an inaccurateterm to use. Robert Anderson was right when he said this. So please view the film with this in mind.However, while I am not a fan of re-makes. I would like to see a remake of this film.

288445,AGTWRSKJ0WEQT,6301978749,David J. Kucharski,"[73, 80]","When MGM released its film version of the award-winning Broadway drama TEA AND SYMPATHY in 1956, the movie was seen as a fairly bold look at a controversial issue: how much non-conformity will society tolerate? Particularly when the expression of that non-conformity goes against acceptable standards of masculine behavior?TEA AND SYMPATHY is the story of Tom Lee, a young student at a boys' prep school. Tom is a loner, interested in music and literature, shy around women, and not much interested in conventional &quot;masculine&quot; pursuits. As a result, he is cruelly taunted by his classmates and the headmaster of his dormitory. The headmaster's wife, Laura, becomes determined to help Tom, in part due to memories of her own &quot;unmasucline&quot; first husband. Her efforts lead to conflict in her present marriage and to a final, dramatic act intended to save Tom from despair.TEA AND SYMPATHY's author, Robert Anderson, said that the work is not really about homosexuality but about our society's tendency to exclude and persecute those who are different for whatever reason (a pertinent topic during the hysterical, &quot;anti-Red&quot; McCarthy era). Still, it is Tom's lack of &quot;conspicuous&quot; masculinity, his presumed homosexuality, that is the reason why he is treated so cruelly, and the play's and film's use of this subject matter made it highly controversial.Is TEA AND SYMPATHY dated today? Perhaps. The film's performances are uneven--Deborah Kerr gives a lovely, sympathetic performance as Laura; John Kerr as Tom is good although a bit stiff and somewhat too old for his role; Leif Erickson as the headmaster is bombastic and overstated. The script contains a few lines that are unintentionally funny. And the film's underlying attitude toward homosexuality (as reflective of the period in which it was made) is sad indeed.  Homosexuality is a topic so shameful that it can't ever be openly discussed. And the possibility that Tom might actually BE gay can never even be considered.However, the film's basic subject matter remains timely and, as a result, many will still find the film disturbing and thought-provoking. Yes, society has become somewhat more accepting of homosexuality. But that acceptance is far from universal.  Young people who are different are still persecuted at schools every day, and &quot;faggot&quot; remains the most damning insult used to exclude those young men who don't fit in.A final trivia note: Those familiar with the play know that it ends with one of the most famous lines of its era: &quot;Years from now, when you talk about this...and you will...be kind.&quot; Yet in the film, there is an additional, final scene that takes place years later. MGM was forced to add this scene so the film would not receive a &quot;Condemned&quot; rating from the Catholic Board of Review. The scene makes little sense and is actually somewhat cruel, throwing a mantle of shame over Tom's past sufferings and Laura's tender act intended to &quot;save&quot; him.",4,Lots of questions raised by this drama,974073600,"11 13, 2000",2000,3018,"['When', 'MGM', 'released', 'film', 'version', 'award-winning', 'Broadway', 'drama', 'TEA', 'AND', 'SYMPATHY', '1956', 'movie', 'was', 'seen', 'fairly', 'bold', 'look', 'controversial', 'issue', 'how', 'much', 'non-conformity', 'will', 'society', 'tolerate', 'Particularly', 'when', 'expression', 'non-conformity', 'acceptable', 'standards', 'masculine', 'behavior', 'TEA', 'AND', 'SYMPATHY', 'story', 'Tom', 'Lee', 'young', 'student', 'boys', 'prep', 'school', 'Tom', 'loner', 'interested', 'music', 'literature', 'shy', 'women', 'not', 'much', 'interested', 'conventional', 'quot', 'quot', 'pursuits', 'result', 'cruelly', 'taunted', 'classmates', 'headmaster', 'dormitory', 'headmaster', 'wife', 'Laura', 'becomes', 'determined', 'help', 'Tom', 'part', 'due', 'memories', 'own', 'quot', 'unmasucline', 'quot', 'first', 'husband', 'efforts', 'lead', 'conflict', 'present', 'marriage', 'final', 'dramatic', 'act', 'intended', 'save', 'Tom', 'despair.TEA', 'AND', 'SYMPATHY', 'author', 'Robert', 'Anderson', 'said', 'work', 'not', 'really', 'homosexuality', 'society', 'tendency', 'exclude', 'persecute', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'reason', 'pertinent', 'topic', 'hysterical', 'quot', 'anti-Red', 'quot', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'Still', 'Tom', 'lack', 'quot', 'conspicuous', 'quot', 'masculinity', 'presumed', 'homosexuality', 'reason', 'why', 'treated', 'so', 'cruelly', 'play', 'film', 'use', 'subject', 'matter', 'made', 'highly', 'controversial.Is', 'TEA', 'AND', 'SYMPATHY', 'dated', 'today', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'uneven', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'lovely', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'Laura', 'John', 'Kerr', 'Tom', 'good', 'bit', 'stiff', 'somewhat', 'too', 'old', 'role', 'Leif', 'Erickson', 'headmaster', 'bombastic', 'overstated', 'script', 'few', 'lines', 'are', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'film', 'underlying', 'attitude', 'homosexuality', 'reflective', 'period', 'was', 'made', 'sad', 'indeed', 'Homosexuality', 'topic', 'so', 'shameful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'openly', 'discussed', 'possibility', 'Tom', 'might', 'actually', 'BE', 'gay', 'can', 'never', 'even', 'be', 'considered.However', 'film', 'basic', 'subject', 'matter', 'timely', 'result', 'many', 'will', 'still', 'find', 'film', 'disturbing', 'thought-provoking', 'Yes', 'society', 'become', 'somewhat', 'more', 'accepting', 'homosexuality', 'acceptance', 'far', 'universal', 'Young', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'are', 'still', 'persecuted', 'schools', 'day', 'quot', 'quot', 'most', 'damning', 'insult', 'used', 'exclude', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'in.A', 'final', 'trivia', 'note', 'familiar', 'play', 'know', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'lines', 'era', 'quot', 'Years', 'now', 'when', 'talk', 'will', 'be', 'kind.', 'quot', 'film', 'additional', 'final', 'scene', 'place', 'years', 'later', 'MGM', 'was', 'forced', 'add', 'scene', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'receive', 'quot', 'Condemned', 'quot', 'rating', 'Catholic', 'Board', 'Review', 'scene', 'little', 'sense', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'cruel', 'throwing', 'mantle', 'shame', 'Tom', 'past', 'sufferings', 'Laura', 'tender', 'act', 'intended', 'quot', 'save', 'quot']",Tea and Sympathy VHS

288447,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6301978749,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","TEA AND SYMPATHY (Dir. Vincent Minelli, 1956, 122 minutes) is in some ways far ahead of its time both in cinematographic style and dialogue. However, it isn't really able to move that way in time concerning its storyline.Someplace, U.S.A. there is what appears to be a prep school. I'm not familiar with this kind of thing but it appears different families employed by the school run dorm houses--the owners (read: the man of the house) is a 'housemaster'. (So they are not ""headmasters"" or ""schoolmasters"" as is erroneously stated.) In the tennis team dorm house, Tom-the-sissy suffers in silence.Yes, Tom, who the other boys nicknamed ""Sister Boy"", likes ""longhair"" music, sings, plays good guitar, can sew like a Singer machine and many other interesting, fascinating things. Good looking, a bit slouchy, and BOY!!--do they ever bully him. Naturally this could have been, in some alternate universe, a story about a gay boy but Tom is 100% straight. In fact, he's in love with the wife of the housemaster/coach.Well, I am informed that in the original play, Tom is, in fact, gay--but I take that tidbit with a grain of salt until I read the play for myself. Meantime I remind you, this is a review of the MOVIE.This film struck me as a vital lesson in the evil, lonely cruelty of an insensitive, hyper-masculine, attention-deficit world. It is a world I recall well, having been ostracized and smacked as a boy for having hand gestures that were considered too ""girly""--by my own parents. Well, someone had to make a man out of me! That mindset is what this movie tries to convey. This film conveys a lot of very good acting (simultaneously showing a lot of bad melodrama) and I was surprised at the mostly natural-sounding dialogue.Someone even says, ""Don't try to bull me!"" and several other lines you wouldn't expect in this era. So what was Minelli trying to say here? This is a definite condemnation of our nation's infamous intolerance and our idea of what a ""man"" is ""supposed to be"". Tom's pals all look like 'nerdy' types, even though Tom is such a loner he has only one friend, his roommate Al. One of the most hilarious scenes here is when Al tries to teach Tom to walk like a man, because, well, Tom, he walks like ... ya know ... and he ought to walk right!It is hard to refrain from passing judgment on this film, as good as it is, as seminal as it is. The character doesn't need to be gay for the message to come through to us. Certainly Minelli's usual hidden agenda must have been to defend the gay community too, but this film has no known gay characters in it. A few suspects in my view, but no one openly gay as Sal Mineo played.In the end I can only recommend this film as a painful lesson in how not to be, and to see how it was in the time of my childhood. You will be amazed at the Neanderthal attitudes that are alive and well now, which you will see in this film. I also know this film created a new genre and inspired countless films.Lastly but never least, I'm proud to recommend this as a family film, and definitely one film families ought to see.",4,"What is this, West of Eden?",1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,3080,"['TEA', 'AND', 'SYMPATHY', 'Dir', 'Vincent', 'Minelli', '1956', '122', 'minutes', 'ways', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'cinematographic', 'style', 'dialogue', 'However', ""n't"", 'really', 'able', 'move', 'way', 'time', 'concerning', 'storyline.Someplace', 'U.S.A.', 'what', 'be', 'prep', 'school', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'kind', 'thing', 'different', 'families', 'employed', 'school', 'run', 'dorm', 'houses', 'owners', 'read', 'man', 'house', ""'housemaster"", 'are', 'not', 'headmasters', 'schoolmasters', 'erroneously', 'stated', 'tennis', 'team', 'dorm', 'house', 'Tom-the-sissy', 'suffers', 'silence.Yes', 'Tom', 'who', 'other', 'boys', 'nicknamed', 'Sister', 'Boy', 'longhair', 'music', 'sings', 'plays', 'good', 'guitar', 'can', 'sew', 'Singer', 'machine', 'many', 'other', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'things', 'Good', 'looking', 'bit', 'slouchy', 'BOY', 'do', 'ever', 'bully', 'Naturally', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'alternate', 'universe', 'story', 'gay', 'boy', 'Tom', '100', '%', 'straight', 'fact', 'love', 'wife', 'housemaster/coach.Well', 'am', 'informed', 'original', 'play', 'Tom', 'fact', 'gay', 'take', 'tidbit', 'grain', 'salt', 'read', 'play', 'Meantime', 'remind', 'review', 'MOVIE.This', 'film', 'struck', 'vital', 'lesson', 'evil', 'lonely', 'cruelty', 'insensitive', 'hyper-masculine', 'attention-deficit', 'world', 'world', 'recall', 'well', 'having', 'been', 'ostracized', 'smacked', 'boy', 'having', 'hand', 'gestures', 'were', 'considered', 'too', 'girly', 'own', 'parents', 'Well', 'someone', 'had', 'make', 'man', 'mindset', 'what', 'movie', 'convey', 'film', 'lot', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'simultaneously', 'showing', 'lot', 'bad', 'melodrama', 'was', 'surprised', 'mostly', 'natural-sounding', 'dialogue.Someone', 'even', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'bull', 'several', 'other', 'lines', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'era', 'what', 'was', 'Minelli', 'trying', 'say', 'here', 'definite', 'condemnation', 'nation', 'infamous', 'intolerance', 'idea', 'what', 'man', 'supposed', 'be', 'Tom', 'pals', 'look', ""'nerdy"", 'types', 'even', 'Tom', 'such', 'loner', 'only', 'one', 'friend', 'roommate', 'Al', 'One', 'most', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'here', 'when', 'Al', 'teach', 'Tom', 'walk', 'man', 'well', 'Tom', 'ya', 'know', 'ought', 'walk', 'right', 'hard', 'refrain', 'passing', 'judgment', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'seminal', 'character', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'gay', 'message', 'come', 'Certainly', 'Minelli', 'usual', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'defend', 'gay', 'community', 'too', 'film', 'known', 'gay', 'characters', 'few', 'suspects', 'view', 'one', 'openly', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'played.In', 'end', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'film', 'painful', 'lesson', 'how', 'not', 'be', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'time', 'childhood', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'Neanderthal', 'attitudes', 'are', 'alive', 'well', 'now', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'also', 'know', 'film', 'created', 'new', 'genre', 'inspired', 'countless', 'films.Lastly', 'never', 'least', ""'m"", 'proud', 'recommend', 'family', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'film', 'families', 'ought', 'see']",Tea and Sympathy VHS

But with my limited sexual experience, and few friends of either sex, I had NO trouble understanding the movie, exactly as it was presented, and as all the actors and director wanted it underdstood. It never occured to me that Tom was gay; he was a sensitive boy whose father had sent him to this boys' school (explitive deleted!)to cure him of wanting to be a folksinger (of which there can never be too many!), reading literature and darning his own socks, having little interest in sports, and with no interest in having sex with a woman just to prove that he liked having sex with women. What a wonderful young man, I thought, and are there any more at home like him?And if Laura's gentle lovemaking with this young man cost her her marriage--well, good! She was better off without her second husband anyway!I hadn't really thought much about the movie for years, until I saw it prsented in ""The Celluloid Closet""--which for the most part is an honest, interesting, moving and entertaining documentary about the way homosexuality was presented on the screen from 1895-1995--as (said with some scorn on the part of the narrator): Laura's act of love is shown as a ""cure"" for homosexuality"" (!) But...there IS no cure for homosexuality, and the fact that Tom' introduction to love and sex from a woman is so successful should remove any lingering doubts as to Tom's sexual orientation--in case you had some, which I never did.It is true that a person, before being introduced to sex (at 2, or 36) may be unsure of his own sexual preferences; he may also NOT be unsure of them. He may think all sorts of things, like, I really love my Teddy Bear, or my dog, or my mother, or the boy next door, or (even) the girl next door.The proof of the pudding is sometimes in the eating of it.I do remember the eating of the pudding, very well.

The first time I saw it, I GOT it and it made me quite sad.  I got that Tom was very smitten with Laura, but all of the males in his life saw something completely different because he happened to be a sensitive young man in a testosterone fueled environment. He was especially sensitive to women which women weren't use to getting and men weren't use to having to give.  Despite the somewhat bogus ending to the movie, I would give anything to have seen Deborah Kerr play Laura on the stage.  I have no doubts that it was even more sensitive and luminescent than the movie.  Laura was a woman who saw the truth and risked her whole way of life to reveal it.  That risk may have ultimately saved Tom, but at great cost to Laura.Both Kerrs were fantastic.  I know that a lot was made of John Kerr's age, but that wasn't a distraction for me at all because his portrayal of Tom was so real to me.  Of course, I can't say enough good things about Deborah Kerr who is one of my favorite people to watch on screen.

Ziinojr,"[3, 3]","""Tea And Sympathy"" was a controversial movie in 1956,but it is now kind of dated.But it is still a strong drama worth seeing.It's the story oftwo lonely people finding each other.Tom Robinson Lee is a sensitive young man very different from the other students at his college,andhounded mercilessly because of it.Laura Reynolds is the wife of his housemaster Bill,who is an insensitive failure as a husband.She becomes sort of a mother to Tom,to whom she grows very close.Laura constantly tries to help Tom fight the constant harrassment of his fellow students,but it grows unbearable and he attempts suicide after adisatrous ""date"" with the town tramp.Laura then seduces Tom to help himprove his manhood,which costs her her marriage.At the class reunion ten years later,a still resentful Bill gives Tom a letter from Laura that makes him appreciate her sacrifice.Contrary to what you may think,the movie is not about homosexuality.The final scene makes that clear.Rather,the film is more about being yourself.But though the film preaches tolerance,it also accurately reflects theattitudes of its time,that if you were different you were gay.And thatdates the movie badly today.However,the film does have strong points that make it worthwhile.It has MGM's usual top-notch production values,andJohn Alton's Metrocolor CinemaScope photography looks great.Adolph Deutschprovides a lovely musical score.Screenwriter Robert Anderson and directorVincente Minnelli have done an excellent job of adapting Anderson'scontroversial play-for the most part.Unfortunately,they had to change some of the dialogue(""Sisterboy"" is the worst epithet hurled at Tom)and change the ending by adding the scene in which Tom gets the ""fallen ""Laura's letter(the play ends with her seducing him).And this dilutes the film's power.What makes the fim work as well as it does is the brilliant cast.Leif Erickson,Darryl Hickman,Norma Crane,and Edward Andrews are outstanding.But the movie belongs to its two stars.Though too old for his role,John Kerr is powerful and very moving as Tom.Deborah Kerr is luminous and enthralling as Laura.Each gives one of their best performances.Deborah in particular perfectly compliments her magnificentwork in ""The King And I"" that same year.She has the film's most memorable moment,in which she reaches out to Tom

288455,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,6301978749,Peter Baklava,"[1, 3]","""Tea and Sympathy"" (1956) was an extraordinary movie for its time, but it wasn't strong enough to overcome the constraints placed upon it by the 1950's culture.Like the films of Douglas Sirk (often compared to ""Tea and Sympathy's"" director, Vincent Minnelli) this film is bold in criticizing the sexual mores and prevalent conception of maculinity of the Fifties decade.  However, ""Tea and Sympathy"", unlike Sirk's dramas, always pulls up short and ostentatiously tiptoes around the real issues.  Sirk had a way of making his points through symbolism.  Minnelli's response to being hamstrung about the subject matter is to resort to making the picture as beautiful as he can, and it is a very striking film.  The palette is all blues and oranges, and the outdoor scenes in particular are gorgeous and painterly.However, the ""look"" of the movie wasn't enough to save it.  As I watched the film, I kept thinking that maybe an outstanding young actor like James Dean could have saved the movie, but I don't think so.  ""Rebel Without a Cause"" wasn't nearly as stilted and straitjacketed in making the case for the sensitive man.Every time ""Tea and Sympathy"" threatens to tear the veneer off sexual hypocrisy, it veers instead into awkward speechifying--the result of a heavy reliance on a scripted play as source material. The movie hinges on Deborah Kerr's character, and because of the movie codes of the era, instead of being a rebel she comes off as a person who is too circumspect to act on her feelings or observations.  And truly in the context of the times, had Kerr's character been honestly portrayed, it would have been as shocking as seeing ""Mrs.Cleaver"" seduce ""Eddie Haskell"" on ""Leave it to Beaver"".""Tea and Sympathy"" is a social critique that died on the vine... although it may have survived as a distant ancestor of movies that succeeded, such as ""The Graduate"", ""The Last Picture Show"", and particularly, ""Pleasantville"", which explored the same territory with the advantage of looking back with irony.So, in the end, ""Tea and Sympathy"" is just a footnote and an oddity, although a pleasant one.",3,Interesting Failure,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,2110,"['Tea', 'Sympathy', '1956', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'movie', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'overcome', 'constraints', 'placed', '1950', 'culture.Like', 'films', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'often', 'compared', 'Tea', 'Sympathy', 'director', 'Vincent', 'Minnelli', 'film', 'bold', 'criticizing', 'sexual', 'mores', 'prevalent', 'conception', 'maculinity', 'Fifties', 'decade', 'However', 'Tea', 'Sympathy', 'Sirk', 'dramas', 'always', 'up', 'short', 'ostentatiously', 'tiptoes', 'real', 'issues', 'Sirk', 'had', 'way', 'making', 'points', 'symbolism', 'Minnelli', 'response', 'being', 'hamstrung', 'subject', 'matter', 'resort', 'making', 'picture', 'as', 'beautiful', 'can', 'very', 'striking', 'film', 'palette', 'blues', 'oranges', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'particular', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'painterly.However', 'look', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'watched', 'film', 'kept', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'outstanding', 'young', 'actor', 'James', 'Dean', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'stilted', 'straitjacketed', 'making', 'case', 'sensitive', 'man.Every', 'time', 'Tea', 'Sympathy', 'tear', 'veneer', 'sexual', 'hypocrisy', 'instead', 'awkward', 'speechifying', 'result', 'heavy', 'reliance', 'scripted', 'play', 'source', 'material', 'movie', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'character', 'movie', 'codes', 'era', 'instead', 'being', 'rebel', 'off', 'person', 'who', 'too', 'circumspect', 'act', 'feelings', 'observations', 'truly', 'context', 'times', 'had', 'Kerr', 'character', 'been', 'honestly', 'portrayed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'shocking', 'seeing', 'Mrs.Cleaver', 'seduce', 'Eddie', 'Haskell', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'Tea', 'Sympathy', 'social', 'critique', 'died', 'vine', 'may', 'have', 'survived', 'distant', 'ancestor', 'movies', 'succeeded', 'such', 'Graduate', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'particularly', 'Pleasantville', 'explored', 'same', 'territory', 'advantage', 'looking', 'back', 'irony.So', 'end', 'Tea', 'Sympathy', 'just', 'footnote', 'oddity', 'pleasant', 'one']",Tea and Sympathy VHS

288460,ACM90BRKX73OG,6301978749,Tom,"[0, 0]","Tea and Sympathy (1956) was directed by Vincente Minnelli for MGM and stars Deborah Kerr, John Kerr, Leif Erickson, and Edward Andrews.Tom Lee (Kerr) is a seventeen-year-old student at Chilton, a New England prep school, in 1945. Unlike the other boys on campus, Tom prefers poetry and classical music to roughhousing. When he's not keeping to himself he enjoys the company of older women and takes a special shine to Laura Reynolds (Kerr), the house mistress. The other prep students torment Tom mercilessly, calling him ""sister boy,"" but Laura sympathizes with him. When Tom seeks out the town floozy to dispel questions about his masculinity, things don't go as anticipated. Laura, who is married to a thoughtless, insensitive ""man's man"" (the film hints he's a closeted homosexual) reaches out to the disheartened boy, giving him the gift of his manhood.This film is based upon the play written by Robert Anderson and directed by Elia Kazan, which opened on Broadway on September 30, 1953 and had a long run of 712 performances. Anderson adapted the play to the screen and Kerr, Kerr, and Erickson reprise their roles.Tea and Sympathy, with its insinuations of homosexuality, was extremely provocative subject matter for its time. Many thought it could never be released as a film, although producer Pandro Berman, Minnelli, and Anderson did bow to the pressure of the Production Code censors by deleting some material and adding a closing sequence in which, ten years after, Tom reads a letter from Laura, now separated from her husband, apologizing for her behavior.It's very difficult for the viewer to accept twenty-five year-old John Kerr as a seventeen-year-old and this detracts from his already stilted performance although Kerr did win a Tony for his portrayal of Tom Lee in the stage version. Erickson does a decent job as the brutish husband/housemaster but his lapses into brooding gazes at the sound of Laura's complaining probably worked better on the stage. Thirty-five year-old Deborah Kerr gives an outstanding performance as the understanding older woman whose unsatisfied physical yearnings simmer beneath the propriety of her circumstances and British upper class accent. Her line just prior to offering herself to Tom, ""Years from now, when you talk about this - and you will - be kind,"" is one of the most famous closing lines in the history of American theater. Darryl Hickman, brother of TV star Duane ""Dobie Gillis"" Hickman plays Tom's roommate and only friend, Al. Ed Andrews provides unintended comic relief as Tom's embarrassed father. Future stars Dean Jones and Tom ""Billy Jack"" Laughlin have small parts as two of Tom's many tormentors.Writer Robert Anderson's own experiences at Phillips Exeter Academy formed the basis of Tea and Sympathy. This film does have something very important to say about acceptance and inclusiveness fifty years before they became social buzzwords.
