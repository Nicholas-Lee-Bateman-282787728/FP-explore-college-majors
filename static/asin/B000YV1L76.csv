1120894,A13UDAIB4TYB0C,B000YV1L76,Dean Robinson,"[32, 32]","My wife and I both love Tanja's workouts on the Balance Ball. In addition to this DVD we also own the Total Body Toning on the Balance Ball and they are the core (excuse the pun) of our weekly workouts.The music in both DVDs is very nice to listen to, not just drum machine beats and synthesizers. The outdoor settings are gorgeous.Tanja is very fun and personable while she explains each move and encourages you throughout the workout. And they truly are FULL BODY workouts that tone you and give you full cardio burn as well.And the wide variety of exercises on both DVDs means you work a wide variety of muscles and won't get bored out doing one set of exercises over and over. We will definitely be purchasing her third and any future DVD.Highly recommend!",5,Excellent workout!,1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2009,760,"['wife', 'love', 'Tanja', 'workouts', 'Balance', 'Ball', 'addition', 'DVD', 'also', 'own', 'Total', 'Body', 'Toning', 'Balance', 'Ball', 'are', 'core', 'pun', 'weekly', 'workouts.The', 'music', 'DVDs', 'very', 'nice', 'listen', 'not', 'just', 'drum', 'machine', 'beats', 'synthesizers', 'outdoor', 'settings', 'are', 'gorgeous.Tanja', 'very', 'fun', 'personable', 'move', 'workout', 'truly', 'are', 'FULL', 'BODY', 'tone', 'give', 'full', 'cardio', 'burn', 'well.And', 'wide', 'variety', 'exercises', 'DVDs', 'work', 'wide', 'variety', 'muscles', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'out', 'doing', 'one', 'set', 'exercises', 'over', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'purchasing', 'third', 'future', 'DVD.Highly', 'recommend']",Balance Ball: Core Cross Train
1120895,A27TQA0XCZUXZY,B000YV1L76,Feles31,"[12, 12]","I've seen reviews on other balance ball workouts where people give low ratings because they are struggling with/hate the ball (not so much the workout.)  I'm glad to see that is not the case with this one.I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.  I have a few balance ball workouts and this one was quite good.  Workout has 3, 20 minute segments for upper body, lower body, and abs.  I worked up a moderate sweat and felt I got an ok workout.  Instructor is low-key and comfortable with not talking constantly throughout.  Two backup ""dancers"" were non-annoying --- as others noted, instructor refers you to beginner modifications if needed but only a few were modified moves (same move but not going as low or high is not very visible) but I don't use the modifications so it is not a problem for me.I tend to prefer indoor rather than outdoor routines --- I find the scenery more of a distraction than anything else and this one made me think ""dry, hot"" the whole time but that is a minor con.  Probably would have liked music with a beat or something but little/no music is better than bad music.Probably best for beginner/intermediates.  A few moves were tough but the majority were not very difficult.  Not really cardio for me but as far as balance ball workouts go, this was good.",4,not so cardio but good balance ball workout,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,1301,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviews', 'other', 'balance', 'ball', 'where', 'people', 'give', 'low', 'ratings', 'are', 'struggling', 'ball', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'workout', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'not', 'case', 'one.I', 'consider', 'intermediate', 'level', 'fitness', 'have', 'few', 'balance', 'ball', 'workouts', 'one', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Workout', '3', '20', 'minute', 'segments', 'upper', 'body', 'lower', 'body', 'abs', 'worked', 'up', 'moderate', 'sweat', 'felt', 'got', 'ok', 'workout', 'Instructor', 'low-key', 'comfortable', 'not', 'talking', 'constantly', 'Two', 'backup', 'dancers', 'were', 'non-annoying', 'others', 'noted', 'instructor', 'refers', 'beginner', 'modifications', 'needed', 'only', 'few', 'were', 'modified', 'moves', 'same', 'move', 'not', 'going', 'low', 'high', 'not', 'very', 'visible', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'modifications', 'not', 'problem', 'me.I', 'tend', 'prefer', 'indoor', 'rather', 'outdoor', 'routines', 'find', 'scenery', 'more', 'distraction', 'anything', 'else', 'one', 'made', 'think', 'dry', 'hot', 'whole', 'time', 'minor', 'con', 'Probably', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'music', 'beat', 'something', 'little/no', 'music', 'better', 'bad', 'music.Probably', 'best', 'beginner/intermediates', 'few', 'moves', 'were', 'tough', 'majority', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'difficult', 'Not', 'really', 'cardio', 'as', 'far', 'balance', 'ball', 'workouts', 'go', 'was', 'good']",Balance Ball: Core Cross Train

I will be looking for more of her dvd workouts.I like the music and the outdoor views. The workout is full body, and also good cardio exercise. Tanja explains all the moves in a good way. She is not annoying teacher compared to other dvds where the voiceovers grate on your nerves. There is a good number of exercises on the dvd to learn. She is a great instructor.I am older and somewhat out of shape, but I was able to do these exercises well, I just had to cut back on the number of reps, but I have improved and am slowly becoming able to do more reps and I am feeling noticeably stronger in the core and my balance has improved.Good video.

This dvd has definitely made it's way into my rotation. The only thing I wish is that you could customize the workouts. It is split into 3 separate workouts: Upper body, Lower body, and Abs/Core. I'd like to tell the dvd that I want it to play all 3 workouts one right after the other. Instead, I have to go back to the main menu and choose the next workout. It's a small complaint, but it would be more convenient. Besides that, I find Tanja to be a good trainer...I get annoyed with the trainers that talk to much and tell me how beautiful I look.
