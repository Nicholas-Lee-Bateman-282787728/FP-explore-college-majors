1092358,A2R9NG5SF8MWQT,B000TV4PYM,Hephzibah,"[0, 0]","""Bing Crosby's White Christmas All Star Show"" is the most misleading DVD title I've ever seen.Yes, Bing does appear briefly to sing ""White Christmas""... but he most definitely did NOT host the show, he did NOT introduce performer, and he did NOT organize the production. If you are looking for one of those wonderful Christmas specials that he did, you will be sadly disappointed.Second, this is NOT the entire production, as is evidenced by the fact that all participants introduced themselves at the very beginning, and there were several who did not appear until the final song (done with the entire cast), where people such as Shirley MacLaine were visible (she was in a dance costume, as was another woman who did not perform, so both must have danced).HOWEVER.  There are some performances that ""redeemed"" the purchase for me. The superb pianist Van Cliburn, fresh from his history-making victory in the Moscow competition... Walter Pigeon and two others doing a great quick-tongued piece of humor... Danny Kaye singing a duet with Louie Armstrong... Jack Benny, George Burns, and Jimmy Stewart doing a song-and-dance routine (yes, Jimmy Stewart!)... Anna Maria Alberghetti, Lena Horne, Gale Storm were among the varied singers... Milton Berle and Bob Hope did monologues (I'd never enjoyed Milton's performances that I'd seen on TV, but this one was great)...If the title was ""USO All Star Christmas Show"" (which was what the show was), and if they had included all the performances, it would probably earn 5 stars.",3,This is NOT hosted by Bing Crosby ! !,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,1522,"['Bing', 'Crosby', 'White', 'Christmas', 'All', 'Star', 'Show', 'most', 'misleading', 'DVD', 'title', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Yes', 'Bing', 'appear', 'briefly', 'sing', 'White', 'Christmas', 'most', 'definitely', 'did', 'NOT', 'host', 'show', 'did', 'NOT', 'introduce', 'performer', 'did', 'NOT', 'organize', 'production', 'are', 'looking', 'one', 'wonderful', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'did', 'will', 'be', 'sadly', 'disappointed.Second', 'NOT', 'entire', 'production', 'evidenced', 'fact', 'participants', 'introduced', 'very', 'beginning', 'were', 'several', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'final', 'song', 'done', 'entire', 'cast', 'where', 'people', 'such', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'were', 'visible', 'was', 'dance', 'costume', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'perform', 'must', 'have', 'danced', '.HOWEVER', 'are', 'performances', 'redeemed', 'purchase', 'superb', 'pianist', 'Van', 'Cliburn', 'fresh', 'history-making', 'victory', 'Moscow', 'competition', 'Walter', 'Pigeon', 'two', 'others', 'doing', 'great', 'quick-tongued', 'piece', 'humor', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'singing', 'duet', 'Louie', 'Armstrong', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'George', 'Burns', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'doing', 'song-and-dance', 'routine', 'yes', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Anna', 'Maria', 'Alberghetti', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'Gale', 'Storm', 'were', 'varied', 'singers', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'did', 'monologues', ""'d"", 'never', 'enjoyed', 'Milton', 'performances', ""'d"", 'seen', 'TV', 'one', 'was', 'great', 'title', 'was', 'USO', 'All', 'Star', 'Christmas', 'Show', 'was', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'had', 'included', 'performances', 'would', 'probably', 'earn', '5', 'stars']",N/A
