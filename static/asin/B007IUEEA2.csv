There's not much to complain about with a cast headed by Nicholas Cage, Guy Pearce and the lovely January Jones and the story-line contains the prerequisite amount of action and mystery to keep one fairly interested. If that's not enough you can always count on a little conspiracy in the mix to liven things up. Everyone loves conspiracies, it answers so many questions as to why things are the way they are. For those reasons I would have to admit that 'Seeking Justice' is a reasonable choice for ones evening entertainment.Where the film fell a little short, at least for me was the predictable nature of the story. You could see the next supposed twist or surprise turn of events a mile away. I don't think there was a single event that took me by surprise, which is unfortunately what makes a film within this genre enjoyable.

Somewhere when Cage is driving around Louisiana having long-winded conversations with convenience store attendants. But, it's okay because the plot is the least of this movies problems.

Asking yourself such questions as, ""Why is smoking hot January Jones married to a 55 year old high school English teacher?"" and ""Why does a middle aged childless couple have alphabet kitchen magnets on their fridge?"" These and other intriguing questions are waiting to be explored in this B-movie laugh fest. I don't know how much positive impact this movie will have on New Orleans tourism; my biggest take-away is that they have a lot of freeways with extremely dangerous pedestrian overpasses.

The problem with Seeking Justice is that it's so dull and maybe could've been a better film if it was placed in better hands.There's very little to commend in this movie. For the talent that's in this film, they all seem to just sort of sleepwalk through their roles. The premise of the movie, that you have a group offering you vigilante justice for a dark price, is an interesting one. It's just that one of the biggest mistakes was hiring Nicholas Cage. He's one of the weakest points in this film and while he doesn't do an absolutely terrible job of acting, he doesn't seem to really be into his role either. As others have said, he just phones in his performance for a paycheck. Since he's the focus of the entire film he just drags everything down with him. I think I could've overlooked a lot if not for this, such as January Jones being able to quickly cut through a pair of handcuffs within a minute or so of rubbing it against some metal. (I doubt it's that easy IRL.)The special features on this DVD are rather light. You get a behind the scenes featurette and the movie's trailer, which sort of just shows me that nobody was really all that invested in this film and just seem to have wanted to get this movie onto DVD as quickly as possible to make back the money they sank into the film.This just could've been so much better, which is what made the film that much more of a disappointment. It's not a horrible flick, but it's something that I recommend renting rather than buying. If you really must own it, just wait for this to hit the eight dollar bins at Wal-Mart.

1531532,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B007IUEEA2,C. Sawin,"[3, 6]","Three months into 2012 and we've already been blessed with two movies starring Nicolas Cage. His return to New Orleans should have been spectacular and something borderline epic since Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans featured Cage at his craziest yet was able to showcase that in this bizarre and intriguing way. Despite most critics and people in general downright hating Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, everyone should be able to agree that it was not only a higher production but a better movie overall in comparison to Seeking Justice.Seeking Justice is kind of like combining The Adjustment Bureau and any Steven Segal movie that wasn't released in theaters with a third of its budget and none of its creativity. For Nicolas Cage, it seems like it's just another absurd role amongst a stack of low grade movies that'd make B-movies blush, but it feels like an odd choice for Guy Pearce. Cage has had this cheese factor to him for years now. Most people can't even look at him without automatically thinking of him punching old women in the face, dressing up in a bear costume, getting bees shoved in every orifice in his face, or some other ridiculous moment from The Wicker Man. Pearce has made a name for himself in small supporting roles lately; The Road, The Hurt Locker, and Animal Kingdom are a few examples. Pearce usually picks some pretty fantastic projects to be a part of and while Simon is similar to Roy Clayton from Traitor and Pearce is able to slide into Simon's shoes with ease, but Seeking Justice feels ridiculously cheap without much of a payoff.Nicolas Cage isn't his out of control, fly-off-the-handle-at-a-moment's-notice self here. He's calm and more collected, at least until his wife Laura (played by January Jones) is beaten to a bloody pulp. Then Cage is noticeably upset. It doesn't seem to be just because his wife was almost killed. Cage seems legitimately irritated and frustrated; almost as if he doesn't want to be there. If Nicolas Cage doesn't want to stick around of whatever terrible movie he's chosen to be a part of, then buckle up because you're in for a special treat.But as always you can count on Cage for some downright ridiculousness and illogical nonsense the likes of which have been seen before but can't be found anywhere else but in a Nicolas Cage movie. That weird candy machine staredown that makes things even more suspicious and awkward and feels like it lasts for an eternity is a great place to start. Just because it's called ""The Forever bar"" and looks like it was stolen out of Willy Wonka's factory doesn't mean it should actually last forever. The prime example though is when Cage walks into a fancy hotel completely underdressed. He's a wanted man at this point; his face plastered all over the city. To look less conspicuous Cage puts a nicer jacket OVER his existing one then walks around in a relieved state as if he just pulled a Houdini on all of New Orleans. Throw in his weird old man shuffle that's essentially jiggling while power walking as the camera bounces around to make it look like he's running faster than he is and you have a trifecta of what in the blue hell is going on here?The only thing Seeking Justice accomplishes is make you feel jealous over the fact that Nicolas Cage was never your teacher while you were in school talking about punching somebody in the face (before physically doing so). Seeking Justice looks and feels like a direct to video release. Its camera work feels like a small step up from underground pornography and Nicolas Cage and his quirky shenanigans are the best part of the movie as you'll be laughing like crazy because it's so bad. This secret organization is like a less entertaining version of the Stonecutters from ""The Simpsons."" Seeking Justice is just a poor excuse of a theatrically released movie that will leave you laughing in disbelief for ever sitting down to see it in the first place.",2,"Hang on, let me catch my breath...",1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,3930,"['Three', 'months', '2012', ""'ve"", 'already', 'been', 'blessed', 'two', 'movies', 'starring', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'return', 'New', 'Orleans', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spectacular', 'something', 'borderline', 'epic', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'Port', 'Call', 'New', 'Orleans', 'featured', 'Cage', 'craziest', 'yet', 'was', 'able', 'showcase', 'bizarre', 'intriguing', 'way', 'most', 'critics', 'people', 'general', 'downright', 'hating', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Spirit', 'Vengeance', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'agree', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'higher', 'production', 'better', 'movie', 'overall', 'comparison', 'Seeking', 'Justice.Seeking', 'Justice', 'kind', 'combining', 'Adjustment', 'Bureau', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'theaters', 'third', 'budget', 'none', 'creativity', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'just', 'absurd', 'role', 'amongst', 'stack', 'low', 'grade', 'movies', ""'d"", 'make', 'B-movies', 'blush', 'odd', 'choice', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Cage', 'had', 'cheese', 'factor', 'years', 'now', 'Most', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'automatically', 'thinking', 'punching', 'old', 'women', 'face', 'dressing', 'up', 'bear', 'costume', 'getting', 'bees', 'shoved', 'orifice', 'face', 'other', 'ridiculous', 'moment', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'Pearce', 'made', 'name', 'small', 'supporting', 'roles', 'lately', 'Road', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'are', 'few', 'examples', 'Pearce', 'usually', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'projects', 'be', 'part', 'Simon', 'similar', 'Roy', 'Clayton', 'Traitor', 'Pearce', 'able', 'slide', 'Simon', 'shoes', 'ease', 'Seeking', 'Justice', 'feels', 'ridiculously', 'cheap', 'much', 'payoff.Nicolas', 'Cage', ""n't"", 'control', ""fly-off-the-handle-at-a-moment's-notice"", 'self', 'here', 'calm', 'more', 'collected', 'least', 'wife', 'Laura', 'played', 'January', 'Jones', 'beaten', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'Then', 'Cage', 'noticeably', 'upset', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'just', 'wife', 'was', 'almost', 'killed', 'Cage', 'legitimately', 'irritated', 'frustrated', 'almost', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', ""n't"", 'want', 'stick', 'terrible', 'movie', 'chosen', 'be', 'part', 'then', 'buckle', 'up', ""'re"", 'special', 'treat.But', 'always', 'can', 'count', 'Cage', 'downright', 'ridiculousness', 'illogical', 'nonsense', 'likes', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'movie', 'weird', 'candy', 'machine', 'staredown', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'suspicious', 'awkward', 'feels', 'eternity', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'Just', 'called', 'Forever', 'bar', 'was', 'stolen', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'factory', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'actually', 'last', 'forever', 'prime', 'example', 'though', 'when', 'Cage', 'walks', 'fancy', 'hotel', 'completely', 'underdressed', 'wanted', 'man', 'point', 'face', 'plastered', 'city', 'look', 'less', 'conspicuous', 'Cage', 'nicer', 'jacket', 'existing', 'one', 'then', 'around', 'relieved', 'state', 'just', 'pulled', 'Houdini', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Throw', 'weird', 'old', 'man', 'essentially', 'jiggling', 'power', 'walking', 'camera', 'around', 'make', 'look', 'running', 'faster', 'have', 'trifecta', 'what', 'blue', 'hell', 'going', 'here', 'only', 'thing', 'Seeking', 'Justice', 'accomplishes', 'make', 'feel', 'jealous', 'fact', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'never', 'teacher', 'were', 'school', 'talking', 'punching', 'somebody', 'face', 'physically', 'doing', 'so', 'Seeking', 'Justice', 'looks', 'feels', 'direct', 'video', 'release', 'camera', 'work', 'feels', 'small', 'step', 'up', 'underground', 'pornography', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'quirky', 'shenanigans', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'crazy', 'so', 'bad', 'secret', 'organization', 'less', 'entertaining', 'version', 'Stonecutters', 'Simpsons', 'Seeking', 'Justice', 'just', 'poor', 'excuse', 'theatrically', 'released', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'laughing', 'disbelief', 'ever', 'sitting', 'down', 'see', 'first', 'place']",N/A
1531533,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B007IUEEA2,David Girod,"[1, 1]","I'm not a big Nicholas Cage fan. Sure I enjoyedCon AirandThe Rock, but after sitting throughThe Wicker Man (Unrated), and watching several other films which seemed to focus more on Cage's scenery chewing than story I gave up. I stumbled upon ""Seeking Justice"" and thought the premise sounded pretty cool, thinking it would be an updated version ofDeath WishI decided to give it a shot.Nicholas Cage plays New Orleans high school english teacher Wil Gerard, whose wife is brutally attacked and raped. While waiting to see his wife in the hospital he is approached by a man named Simon who is played by Guy Pearce. Simon tells Wil that he knows who attacked Wil's wife, and with Wil's consent, Simon can have a stranger kill the rapist. In exchange Simon will want a favor from Wil in the future. Wil struggles with the idea initially, but is so rattled and angered by the attack on his wife that he finally agrees to Simon's plan.Once Simon puts his plan into action, and Wil is drawn into a world of eye-for-an-eye, he begins to have serious doubts and regrets his decision to go along with Simon's plan. And once Wil's wife is released from the hospital, Simon soon shows up on his doorstep looking for Wil to fulfill his part of their bargain.With a really solid story, and Cage's tendency to overact kept in check, ""Seeking Justice"" is a fun little thriller. Backing up Nicholas Cage is a really good cast.

1531536,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,B007IUEEA2,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[0, 0]","First off, let me confess that I enjoy almost every movie Nicolas Cage has made.  That said, I found the ""chain letter"" approach to revenge (aka, justice) very intriguing and thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie.  When I say ""chain letter"" revenge, I am saying that one person, in this case Will Gerard (Nicolas Cage), ""receives"" an offer (chain letter) to have his wife's rapist, Hodge (Alex Van), killed (the promise of a chain letter) in exchange for some future request (forwarding the chain letter).  Will thus gets an offer/letter from Simon (Guy Pearce), who approaches Will in the hospital allegedly representing an organization of concerned citizens--other letter receivers/senders seeking justice/the promise of a chain letter--who will kill Hodge (the ""carrot"" of a chain letter).  All Will has to do is agree to do the organization a favor/sending the chain letter to others some time in the future.  Not thinking clearly, Will agrees to the terms (a future promise/sending the letter to others) fearful that the habitual criminal, Hodge, will yet again be set free by the justice system.  Six months later, Will is contacted by the organization/Simon for a favor/sending out letters.  The favor/forwarding the chain letter: ""accidentally"" bumping someone over a railing into auto traffic (i.e., killing the man).  The rest of the story is about Will's actions and the consequences of Will's agreement/forwarding the favor of getting revenge.I easily found myself asking what would I do.  From the prospective of my own life, where the so called justice system is apathetic or invisible, I have on occasion thought that revenge would be sweet.  But, as the story demonstrates, all actions come with a price--all be it, usually one that we willingly pay under ""normal"" circumstances.  SEEKING JUSTICE is great action combined with ethical dilemmas, and I highly recommend the film to others.  The movie is certainly one I will watch more than once.  And if you are a Nicolas Cage fan, this is a must watch movie (Guy Pearce and January Jones (star ofLove's Enduring Promise) play out their rolls with believability).The DVD version I got through the Vine Program came with a slip cover that the case goes into, and has only one bonus feature: SEEKING JUSTICE: Behind the Scenes, which is OK.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[0, 0]","InThe Star Chamber, a group of circuit court judges become increasingly frustrated as time & again suspects are let off the hook due to some legal technicality or some improper procedure(s) committed by either the police or investigators of the incident in question.  When their despair reaches a critical mass, they decide to form their own ""underground"" courtroom where they will review cases one-by-one.  Due to their expertise and diligence, they will not find anyone guilty who is not, in fact, guilty (or so they think?).  For those who are found guilty, a hit-man is summoned to bump them off.  Justice prevails (again, so they think).The present film operates on a similar premise.  In this case, instead of judges, average, everyday people from all walks of life form a secret society designed to punish malefactors minus the cumbersome machinery of the justice system.  {As a sidenote, it is fitting that the story takes place in New Orleans;  for years & years various gangs in the N.O. area have manipulated and taken advantage of the ineptitude of the Cajun justice system.}In both cases, whether vigilante justice is administered by judges or by regular citizens, problems are bound to occur.  Once you remove the barrier of due process and the regular rule of law, where do you stop?  And what safeguards do you  / can you put in place to ensure that the innocent are not falsely punished?It is, after all, a very slippery slope.All of the above questions are encapsulated in the present story.  Nicholas Cage plays a schoolteacher who is caught between a rock & a hard place after a violent crime is committed against his family.  January Jones plays his wife, and her exquisite girl-next-door beauty is nothing short of breath-taking!Word to the wise:  this film contains some extremely disturbing images of violence against women.  If you're looking for a feel-good movie, this is NOT the one to grab.In sum, this movie is something of a cross betweenThe Star ChamberandThe Game.  Of course, instead of Mike Douglas we get Nick Cage.

The film is a tightly written one (Todd Hickey and Robert Tannen) and solidly directed by Roger Donaldson and is fortunately graced with a cast of actors who make the strange mixture of characters credible.The setting is New Orleans where Will Gerard (Nicholas Cage) is an English teacher at Rampart High, the kind of teacher who cares about his rather unruly students and shares his love for teaching with his fellow teacher and friend Jimmy (Harold Perrineau). Will is happily married to Laura (January Jones), a cellist who rehearses frequently with her chamber music ensemble. One night, Laura leaves a rehearsal and is brutally assaulted and raped while Will is playing chess with Jimmy. When Will is visiting her in the hospital, out of the blue a stranger named Simon (Guy Pearce) tells him that he belongs to an organization of vigilantes and offers to eliminate the assailant. In return, the organization would want a favor from Will in the future. Will hesitantly agrees, and the criminal is murdered. Six months later, while Laura is still paranoid about leaving the house and lives in fear, Simon collects his debt with Will. He demands that Will kill Alan Marsh, a pedophile. Will accidentally kills Alan and soon he learns that the victim was an awarded journalist that was investigating the organization. Now he seeks evidences to prove his innocence but the network of the organization is powerful and is seeking out Will to eliminate him.There is a strong supporting cast including Jennifer Carpenter and Xander Berkeley who help make the strange intertwining of characters morphing from good guys to bad guys and back again work smoothly.  And while the film is a strong one in general, the pleasure is to finally see Nicholas Cage given a script in which he can excel.

I don't believe for a minute that the events of the story could happen and that the people -- especially Nicolas Cage's and January Jones's characters -- could or would do the things they do in this story. To me, that's not the point. The point is a good ride.I used to work on a cruise ship that sailed out of New Orleans every Saturday, so seeing a movie set in that city is always fun, even though I myself haven't been back there since Hurricane Katrine worked its horrors on a city that some idiot built below sea level on a bend in a major river.I found the movie exciting from beginning to end: well made, tautly directed, convincingly acted...unless you find it a bit hard to swallow that a quiet English teacher at an inner-city high school and a cello player in the local amateur student orchestra could get through this without total breakdown. Once you've accepted that, it's a rollercoaster right to the finish line.To recap the story a bit, Nicolas Cage plays Will Gerard, a high school English teacher. His wife, Laura (January Jones), is a cellist in some apparently amateur orchestra. She gets mugged and raped on the way home one night after a rehearsal. While at the hospital, waiting it out, Will is approached by Simon (Guy Pearce), a total stranger, who offers to have the rapist killed in exchange for perhaps one or two favors down the line. Those favors at first involve watching a woman and her children at the zoo and if they're okay, fine; but if he sees her husband in the vicinity, he's to report it to Simon and then it's out of his hands. Simple enough, but Will isn't thrilled by being involved in any of this. It escalates, of course, to the point where he's forced to kill someone, reasons not given. He does in the end because if he doesn't, bad things will happen...and now he's under police scrutiny. It escalates until by chance Will finds evidence that he can hold over Simon's head (and those of his fellow vigilantes). The reason he was to kill the guy is that the guy was an investigative journalist who was working up an expos&eacute; of these vigilantes. A big shoot-out ensues with all the baddies dead and Will and his wife being told by one of the cops to ""go away"" and things would be handled. It's quite suspenseful and of course, improbable.I used to have a friend in New Orleans who owned a florist business. He was one of several businessmen in the city who belonged to a sort of co-op. If my friend wanted to eat dinner at some restaurant, he'd go to one managed by someone else in the co-op. He'd dine for free, with his bill computed in points. Then the owner of the restaurant would have X-number of points added to his account and he could spend them at some other establishment connected with the co-op, and so forth. In a way, the movie's you-scratch-my-back-and-I'll-scratch-yours setup reminded me of that...though on a slightly less legal level.As with most stories like this, repeated viewings will unearth plot holes big enough to hold the Superdome. But in simple fact, I DON'T CARE! The movie moves along and keeps you involved right to the end. What more could one want. If you could add in an air-tight plot with no errors along the way, you'd have a 10-star film. But until one of those rolls down the pike, this one will do just fine, thank you.",4,A great ride,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,3978,"['look', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'submitted', 'Amazon', 'own', 'volition', ""'m"", 'member', 'Vine', 'program', 'find', 'very', 'often', 'disagree', 'majority', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Usually', 'try', 'not', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'opinion', 'book/movie/CD', 'color', 'mine', 'Sometimes', 'good', 'faith', 'steer', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'diametrically', 'opposite', 'own', 'knew', 'nothing', 'movie', 'going', 'way', 'could', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'story/action', 'So', 'when', 'friend', 'sent', 'link', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'star-and-a-half', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'will', 'eventually.SEEKING', 'JUSTICE', 'exciting', 'ride', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'minute', 'events', 'story', 'could', 'happen', 'people', 'especially', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'January', 'Jones', 'characters', 'could', 'would', 'do', 'things', 'do', 'story', 'not', 'point', 'point', 'good', 'ride.I', 'used', 'work', 'cruise', 'ship', 'sailed', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Saturday', 'so', 'seeing', 'movie', 'set', 'city', 'always', 'fun', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'back', 'there', 'Hurricane', 'Katrine', 'worked', 'horrors', 'city', 'idiot', 'built', 'sea', 'level', 'bend', 'major', 'river.I', 'found', 'movie', 'exciting', 'beginning', 'end', 'well', 'made', 'tautly', 'directed', 'convincingly', 'acted', 'find', 'bit', 'hard', 'swallow', 'quiet', 'English', 'teacher', 'inner-city', 'high', 'school', 'cello', 'player', 'local', 'amateur', 'student', 'orchestra', 'could', 'get', 'total', 'breakdown', 'Once', ""'ve"", 'accepted', 'rollercoaster', 'right', 'finish', 'line.To', 'recap', 'story', 'bit', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'plays', 'Will', 'Gerard', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'wife', 'Laura', 'January', 'Jones', 'cellist', 'apparently', 'amateur', 'orchestra', 'mugged', 'raped', 'way', 'home', 'one', 'night', 'rehearsal', 'hospital', 'waiting', 'out', 'Will', 'approached', 'Simon', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'total', 'stranger', 'who', 'have', 'rapist', 'killed', 'exchange', 'perhaps', 'one', 'two', 'favors', 'line', 'favors', 'first', 'involve', 'watching', 'woman', 'children', 'zoo', ""'re"", 'okay', 'fine', 'husband', 'vicinity', 'report', 'Simon', 'then', 'hands', 'Simple', 'enough', 'Will', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'being', 'involved', 'course', 'point', 'where', 'forced', 'kill', 'someone', 'reasons', 'not', 'given', 'end', ""n't"", 'bad', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'now', 'police', 'scrutiny', 'chance', 'Will', 'evidence', 'can', 'hold', 'over', 'Simon', 'head', 'fellow', 'vigilantes', 'reason', 'was', 'kill', 'guy', 'guy', 'was', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'who', 'was', 'working', 'up', 'expos', 'eacute', 'vigilantes', 'big', 'shoot-out', 'ensues', 'baddies', 'dead', 'Will', 'wife', 'being', 'told', 'one', 'cops', 'go', 'away', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'handled', 'quite', 'suspenseful', 'course', 'improbable.I', 'used', 'have', 'friend', 'New', 'Orleans', 'who', 'owned', 'florist', 'business', 'was', 'one', 'several', 'businessmen', 'city', 'who', 'belonged', 'sort', 'co-op', 'friend', 'wanted', 'eat', 'dinner', 'restaurant', ""'d"", 'go', 'one', 'managed', 'someone', 'else', 'co-op', ""'d"", 'dine', 'free', 'bill', 'computed', 'points', 'Then', 'owner', 'restaurant', 'would', 'have', 'X-number', 'points', 'added', 'account', 'could', 'spend', 'other', 'establishment', 'connected', 'co-op', 'so', 'forth', 'way', 'movie', ""you-scratch-my-back-and-I'll-scratch-yours"", 'setup', 'reminded', 'slightly', 'less', 'legal', 'level.As', 'most', 'stories', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'will', 'unearth', 'plot', 'holes', 'big', 'enough', 'hold', 'Superdome', 'simple', 'fact', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'CARE', 'movie', 'along', 'involved', 'right', 'end', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'one', 'want', 'could', 'add', 'air-tight', 'plot', 'errors', 'way', ""'d"", 'have', '10-star', 'film', 'one', 'rolls', 'down', 'pike', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'fine', 'thank']",N/A

1531549,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B007IUEEA2,James Morris,"[0, 1]","I really have nothing against action flicks, even if they do constitute the smallest portion of my video library.  Vigilante films, however, are another story.  It's not that I can't appreciate a good action film for what it's worth; it's merely that I don't approve of vigilantism, no matter what the cause and no matter who the protagonist may be.  As a result, SEEKING JUSTICE annoyed me no end, even when I was hoping against hope that the ending would provide some moral balance.In SEEKING JUSTICE, Nicolas Cage, an actor I frequently admire, plays schoolteacher Will Gerard, a likable, caring guy who clearly loves his beautiful wife Laura (January Jones) very much.  When Laura is robbed, raped and beaten, he is crushed.  At the hospital, he is approached by Simon (Guy Pearce), the leader of one ""Cell"" in a large organization that ""dispenses justice"".  Simon tells Gerard that, ""We know who did this...  If we turned him over to the police, he might get out in eleven months.  You can do more time for tax evasion.""  Simon also promises that, in exchange for Gerard's consent and agreement to ""maybe make a phone call, or help us out"" sometime in the future, ""they"" will ""take care"" of Laura's attacker.  Caught in a vulnerable moment, Gerard reluctantly agrees.He soon finds himself caught in a web of murder and intrigue.  The vigilante organization will stop at nothing to avenge violent crime - and also keep themselves from being discovered.  Apparently ""they"" (the organization is never given a name) are so powerful, they can even enter locked apartments whose locks have just been changed and so pervasive that even the police and their victim's best friends will do their bidding.The rest of the plot I won't describe; I never reveal too much of a ""thriller"" even when I don't like it.  But I would like to comment on some elements of the film.As an entertaining mindless thriller, I could have cut SEEKING JUSTICE some slack.  If the director and writer were aiming for a low-brow thriller, it may have worked for me, even though, as near as I could tell, the plot of SEEKING JUSTICE requires suspension of disbelief on a level not seen since the nineteen-forties.  There are so many surreal aspects to the story that, even for the sake of entertainment, I was unable to swallow the possibility of what I was seeing.  In the first twenty minutes, I kept thinking that Alfred Hitchcock's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN had somehow merged with DEATH WISH.  I almost wished it had; the resulting story would at least have had some credibility.However, more disturbing for me was the immorality of it all.  Several years ago, I remember hating a certain film (supposedly based on a true story), about the killer of a child-molester who is brought to justice.  The twist in that all-star shocker was that the prosecution is thwarted by a district attorney, a priest and several other ""sympathizers"" who believe the killer should go free.  I refused to accept the ending of that film and its celebratory mood, because a guilty murderer gets away with his crime in the name of ""justice"".  While SEEKING JUSTICE had a somewhat different spin, the idea of vigilante justice succeeding because good people are willing to look the other way just made no sense to me.  I didn't get it then and I don't get it now.  Throughout SEEKING JUSTICE, I was hoping that somebody (preferably Nicolas Cage's character, but anybody would suffice) would do the right thing and try to put a stop to the madness.  For a moment, I almost thought it would happen, until the very last line of the film, which left me completely cold.  JUSTICE does not prevail in SEEKING JUSTICE, and so we are left with a third-rate action film.It could have been more, but Screenwriter Robert Tannen and Director Roger Donaldson chose the moral low-ground.  Better to pander, I guess, to what the majority might expect than teach someone a truly needed lesson.  Sorry, but it just didn't sit right with me.If you're just looking for action, you may very well enjoy it.  But if you have a sense of true justice, SEEKING JUSTICE will annoy you as much as it did me.  I rate this film four stars for its action sequences, but minus two for it's ridiculous plot and moral stance.",2,"Absurd, Unbelievable and Just Plain Wrong!",1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,4240,"['really', 'have', 'nothing', 'action', 'flicks', 'even', 'do', 'constitute', 'smallest', 'portion', 'video', 'library', 'Vigilante', 'films', 'however', 'are', 'story', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'what', 'worth', 'merely', 'do', ""n't"", 'approve', 'vigilantism', 'matter', 'what', 'cause', 'matter', 'who', 'protagonist', 'may', 'be', 'result', 'SEEKING', 'JUSTICE', 'annoyed', 'end', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'hoping', 'hope', 'ending', 'would', 'provide', 'moral', 'balance.In', 'SEEKING', 'JUSTICE', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'actor', 'frequently', 'admire', 'schoolteacher', 'Will', 'Gerard', 'likable', 'caring', 'guy', 'who', 'clearly', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Laura', 'January', 'Jones', 'very', 'much', 'When', 'Laura', 'robbed', 'raped', 'beaten', 'crushed', 'hospital', 'approached', 'Simon', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'leader', 'one', 'Cell', 'large', 'organization', 'dispenses', 'justice', 'Simon', 'Gerard', 'know', 'who', 'did', 'turned', 'police', 'might', 'get', 'out', 'eleven', 'months', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'time', 'tax', 'evasion', 'Simon', 'also', 'exchange', 'Gerard', 'consent', 'agreement', 'maybe', 'make', 'phone', 'call', 'help', 'out', 'sometime', 'future', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'Laura', 'attacker', 'Caught', 'vulnerable', 'moment', 'Gerard', 'reluctantly', 'agrees.He', 'soon', 'caught', 'web', 'murder', 'intrigue', 'vigilante', 'organization', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'avenge', 'violent', 'crime', 'also', 'keep', 'being', 'discovered', 'Apparently', 'organization', 'never', 'given', 'name', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'can', 'even', 'enter', 'locked', 'apartments', 'locks', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'changed', 'so', 'pervasive', 'even', 'police', 'victim', 'best', 'friends', 'will', 'do', 'bidding.The', 'rest', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'never', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'thriller', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'would', 'like', 'comment', 'elements', 'film.As', 'entertaining', 'mindless', 'thriller', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'SEEKING', 'JUSTICE', 'slack', 'director', 'writer', 'were', 'aiming', 'low-brow', 'thriller', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'even', 'though', 'as', 'could', 'tell', 'plot', 'SEEKING', 'JUSTICE', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'level', 'not', 'seen', 'nineteen-forties', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'surreal', 'aspects', 'story', 'even', 'sake', 'entertainment', 'was', 'unable', 'swallow', 'possibility', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'STRANGERS', 'ON', 'A', 'TRAIN', 'had', 'somehow', 'merged', 'DEATH', 'WISH', 'almost', 'wished', 'had', 'resulting', 'story', 'would', 'least', 'have', 'had', 'credibility.However', 'more', 'disturbing', 'was', 'immorality', 'Several', 'years', 'ago', 'remember', 'hating', 'certain', 'film', 'supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'killer', 'child-molester', 'who', 'brought', 'justice', 'twist', 'all-star', 'shocker', 'was', 'prosecution', 'thwarted', 'district', 'attorney', 'priest', 'several', 'other', 'sympathizers', 'who', 'believe', 'killer', 'should', 'go', 'free', 'refused', 'accept', 'ending', 'film', 'celebratory', 'mood', 'guilty', 'murderer', 'away', 'crime', 'name', 'justice', 'SEEKING', 'JUSTICE', 'had', 'somewhat', 'different', 'spin', 'idea', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'succeeding', 'good', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'just', 'made', 'sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'now', 'SEEKING', 'JUSTICE', 'was', 'hoping', 'somebody', 'preferably', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'character', 'anybody', 'would', 'suffice', 'would', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'try', 'put', 'stop', 'madness', 'moment', 'almost', 'thought', 'would', 'happen', 'very', 'last', 'line', 'film', 'left', 'completely', 'cold', 'JUSTICE', 'not', 'prevail', 'SEEKING', 'JUSTICE', 'so', 'are', 'left', 'third-rate', 'action', 'film.It', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'Screenwriter', 'Robert', 'Tannen', 'Director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'chose', 'moral', 'low-ground', 'Better', 'pander', 'guess', 'what', 'majority', 'might', 'expect', 'teach', 'someone', 'truly', 'needed', 'lesson', 'Sorry', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'me.If', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'action', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'enjoy', 'have', 'sense', 'true', 'justice', 'SEEKING', 'JUSTICE', 'will', 'annoy', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'rate', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'action', 'sequences', 'two', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'moral', 'stance']",N/A

His beautiful wife Laura (January Jones), a musician at Mahalia Jackson Theatre, is brutally raped.  At the hospital, Simon Adams (Guy Pearce) tells Will that he represents a vigilante justice group that promises to kill the rapist provided that he does them a favor.  A stressed Will agrees and the rapist is shot dead.  However, six months later, Will's life becomes a living nightmare when Simon demands that he push a child pornographer, Alan Marsh, from a bridge.""Seeking Justice"" asks the question:  How far will you go to obtain justice when a loved one is violated?""  There have been numerous films depicting the actions of a lone vigilante; they range from the classic ""Death Wish"" (Death Wish) to the more current release ""The Brave One"" (The Brave One [Blu-ray]).  I enjoy vigilante films because our judicial system is designed to protect the criminal.  Ask Sondra Lock's character, Jennifer Spencer, in ""Sudden Impact"" (Dirty Harry: Ultimate Collector's Edition (Dirty Harry / Magnum Force / The Enforcer / Sudden Impact / The Dead Pool) [Blu-ray]).  However, Will Gerard becomes entangled in a vigilante group that tries to turn him into a murderer, which he is not.  This theme was also explored in ""Point of No Return"" (Point of No Return  [Blu-ray]) when Bridget Fonda's street-wise character, Maggie Hayward, is sent to a secret, government-operated school to be trained as a seductive assassin.  Her training eventually failed because deep within her heart she was not a murderer.Will refuses to become a part of Simon's vigilante organization.  (This theme was also explored in ""The Star Chamber"" (The Star Chamber), starring Michael Douglas; he portrays Superior Court Judge Steven R. Hardin whose conscience won't allow him to belong to an organization that sanctions the assassinations of criminals who've escaped the justice system.)  It is obvious that Simon experienced a tragedy that left a loved one seriously injured or dead; perhaps he feels that the justice system betrayed him.  His reaction was vastly different from Will's.  Will and Simon exist in all of us as spiritual entities that constantly battle, forcing us to choose between good and evil.""Seeking Justice"" is a slick, psychological thriller in which Will Gerard finds himself trapped in a twisted, endless game of cat and mouse.  (I could feel the tension coming off of Will in waves; Nicholas Cage and the other lead actors gave excellent performances.)  Some of the police officers of the NOPD belong to Simon's vigilante organization.  Will doesn't know who he can trust as he is chased throughout New Orleans--a chase that ends in a bloody showdown at an abandoned mall near the superdome.  The ending is a creepy one that made me shiver with fear.  This film is perfect for conspiracy theorists.  Will reminded me of poor Rosemary Woodhouse in ""Rosemary's Baby"" (Rosemary's Baby) when she discovers that everyone around her is a witch.Anchor Bay's DVD release of ""Seeking Justice"" is a mix bag.  The film is shown in its theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1 with Spanish subtitles and English Subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired (SDH).  As far as extras are concerned, there are a short feature, ""Seeking Justice: Behind the Scenes"" (approximately seven minutes) and a trailer.  There is the absence of audio commentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, etc.  The ""Seeking Justice: Behind the Scenes"" has some interesting interviews with the director and lead actors.  However, I was disappointed that there were no in-depth discussions concerning the shooting locales and the spectacular stunts.Fans of Nicholas Cage, vigilante justice films and action thrillers will want to watch ""Seeking Justice.""  If you enjoyed this film, you may want to watch some of the others I referenced above.  A lesser known gem is ""The Ladies Club"" (Ladies Club,the [VHS]).  A group of vigilante women, led by a female doctor, obtain vengeance against their rapists through abduction and castration.  I'm surprised Anchor Bay hasn't released this 1986 classic on DVD.

Then check out ""Seeking Justice"" and see for yourself!Nicolas Cage plays Will Gerard, a high school English teacher in New Orleans who's an easy-going intellectual type ... until his wife Laura (January Jones) is brutally beaten and raped.  Overwhelmed and dazed, confused and outraged, Will is approached in the hospital waiting room by a mysterious man named Simon (Guy Pearce), who just happens to know the identity of Laura's attacker.  Simon offers Will some immediate vigilante-style justice - IF Will agrees to perform a service for his organization sometime in the future.  Hesitantly, Will accepts.  Flash forward to six months later: Simon returns to collect payment on Will's debt, and the hapless teacher quickly learns that he has made a deal with the devil himself.  What follows are a series of hair-raising, adrenaline-pumping onscreen chases, escapes, murders, betrayals, and kidnappings that finally culminate in a heart-pounding showdown ... and a twist ending.Cage gives an energetic, magnetic performance as Will; his somewhat quirky onscreen persona is perfect for this role.  No other actor is more adept than he at credibly shifting from laid-back passivity to manic hyperactivity.  His intensity is matched by that of Guy Pearce as Simon, who starts off being suave and smooth, but increasingly loses his cool as control of Will slips through his fingers.  January Jones is excellent as Will's wife, a victim who reclaims control of her life, and superb work is also turned in by Harold Perrineau as Will's best friend and Xander Berkeley as a savvy police lieutenant.  Among the cast, only Jennifer Carpenter seems wasted; she has relatively little screen time, and not much to do.All in all, ""Seeking Justice"" is worth a look, perfect for one of those nights you want to curl up with a bowl of popcorn and be entertained.  Director Roger Donaldson and film editor Jay Cassidy keep things moving right along; through the opening credits to the final fadeout, there's not a wasted frame of film.

The award winning actor Nicolas Cage heads the cast (as Will Gerard) with January Jones as his wife(Laura). Will is an English teacher and his wife is brutally beaten and raped.  Like any normal person would be, he gets angry after seeing his wife's bruised face.While in the hospital waiting room a stranger, Simon (Guy Pearce) begins talking to Cage. Simon tells Will that he knows who did this to his wife and would be happy to take care of the rapist.  At first Will refuses the offer, but after again viewing his wife, he decides to give Simon the go ahead and take care of the problem.After six months, Simon again contacts Will and now the drama and problems start for Will.  I do not believe in giving too much away and spoil the movie by telling every little detail.  One of the ways I judge a movie is whether or not I would like to see a movie again.

Menta, Jr.","[0, 0]","Roger Donaldson's ""Seeking Justice"" didn't receive a lot of attention- from the media or audiences- when it was released in theaters not too long ago, but it's worth a look at home via disc, download, or streaming (so many options these days).  The film reminded me a lot of Mr. Donaldson's old thriller with Kevin Costner, ""No Way Out"".  Like that earlier film, there's lots of tension and action, but all laced with an uncomfortable (and involving) paranoia as both audience members and the center-stage characters constantly wonder who is in on the big conspiracy.The story in ""Seeking Justice"" involves a vigilante group that offers, well... justice to the Nicholas Cage character and his wife (played by January Jones) after the wife is brutally attacked by some weirdo creep.  Though it rubs him the wrong way, the husband eventually takes the deal, but soon finds out that there's no free lunch.  You see, Cage is all too quickly asked to return the favor and help the vigilante group exact vengeance against some other thug who supposedly did something horrible, this time to a little kid.  The ""supposedly"" is what complicates the film, demonstrating that vigilante justice maybe isn't the simple, satisfying thing many believe it is.In the end, this was a solid, well-crafted thriller about a topic- taking the law into one's own hands- that is usually relegated to exploitation films and other ""crowd pleaser"" type movies (the Neil Jordan/Jodie Foster movie ""The Brave One"" is the only other modern, A-list movie that comes to mind that tackled the subject, and that did a decent job, too).

The first half hour is less than riveting and I found myself thinking about all the things I should probably be doing rather than watching this movie during that part.  However, once the story kicks in it's actually quite good.  Nic Cage is more than bearable in this film and Guy Pearce is pretty much Guy Pearce; ditto for January Jones.  So there's not a major shock in terms of who the actors are.  The story itself, while not wholly original, does manage to make sense while still throwing a few twists and turns at the viewer.  Cage as a schoolteacher I don't quite buy but I don't have to in order to enjoy the film.  Sure, it's far from perfect.  Some guy's wife gets mugged, guy wants justice, guy and wife ends up in the middle of a conspiracy and you can figure it out from there.  But the movie is done pretty well for the budget and what's presented.  It's convincing enough without having to go over the top with action sequences and explosions and all of that from big budget films.  Seeking Justice has the feel of a solid film with decent acting and editing and a passable script.  Somewhere below Hollywood budget but well above made for tv.

Belle ""lizzabelle, English major nerd""","[1, 1]","I was excited to get this movie because I love Guy Pearce (even if he is the villian) and I love Nicholas Cage. However, the plot seems to be somewhat lacking. If you have ever seen an action movie WITHOUT explosions or any sort of mafia movie, you had already seen this movie, in a sense. The story is of a man (Nick Cage) whose wife is raped. While he is sitting in a waiting room at the hospital, a man (Pearce) approaches him about a transaction to ""take care of"" the rapist and all Cage has to do in the future is repay them with some small favor (as Pearce tells him ""a phone call here"" and other various trivial things).  Pearce tells Cage that he is part of a vigilante organization who basically dispatches people who have fallen through the justice system cracks and have no business being on the street. Since the process seems easy enough so Cage agrees (somewhat reluctantly).Of course, we know Mr. Pearce was lying about the minimalism to which Cage would be involved. It starts out with mailing a letter, then following a woman and her two daughters before he is finally set up for murder by this charming organization. I will spare the ending (which is utterly predictable) so you have some surprise left but this movie does not live up to its potential. The suspense parts of the movie actually have more of a hurry up and wait quality to them. For example, in the beginning we see Cage's wife, played by January Jones, leaving her rehearsal (she is a musician) in the dark, ALONE, walking down a dimly lit walkway. Cage's character is across town playing chess with a friend and they make a point of showing his cellphone being turned off before the game. Hmmm, dark streets, big city, woman alone, of course somethng bad is going to happen. This occurs repeatedly throughout the plot: Omnious set up, supposed suspense building, wait for it!, something bad happens! So predictable.The acting in this movie is rather flat, the plot is predictable and I rarely felt any sort of suspense. If you want to watch suspensful rent Rear Window or Psycho. If you are a diehard Nick Cage fan, you might like this movie. If you are a fan of Guy Pearce, despite nearly top billing he is hardly in the movie until the end.

Perhaps that's because he's been making them at such a frantic pace or at least it seems that way. In any event his latest thriller SEEKING JUSTICE offers a decent night's entertainment but still finds itself in that so so stack of Cage films.In the film Cage plays Will Gerard, an English teacher in an inner city school who is married to Laura (January Jones), a cellist with the local symphony. One night after practice while Will is playing chess with his best friend Jimmy (Harold Perrineau), Laura is attacked and raped when she gets to her car.Sitting in the hospital waiting room filled with dread and despair over the event Will is approached by a man sitting nearby. Introducing himself as Simon (Guy Pearce) he tells Will that this is not the first time this man has raped someone. He has the man's picture and shows him to Will. Then he offers him a chance for justice. He tells Will he might ask him for a favor in the future, no questions asked. In return, Simon and a group of like minded individuals will take care of the rapist. All he has to do is give them a predetermined sign.Will makes the choice and gives the sign. Several days later he is given a picture of the rapist who was shot and killed that night. The months go on and Will and Laura move forward. Then one day Simon shows up and asks Will if he's ready to repay his debt. When he thinks it involves his killing someone else, Will reneges on the deal. But Simon forces his hand and lets Will know he's willing to put Laura in danger if he doesn't go along.Will agrees and is instructed to meet a man they identify as a child molester on an overpass near the highway. Unable to bring himself to kill the man he tries to talk to him but the man attempts to fight Will and accidentally falls onto the street below to his death. While it appears Will has honored the contract, he later finds the police looking for him to arrest him for the murder. It turns out the man wasn't a molester at all but a new reporter.Avoiding the police and digging deeper, Will finds out the man knew something about the group that Simon is in charge of. On the run and trying to find a way out, Will follows the clues as to who this group is and how high up they go. With helps along the way, he tries to find a way out of the predicament he's gotten himself into.The movie offers a decent mystery here and a chase that last long enough and not too long to keep the action moving forward. The cast is excellent with the exception of Cage I'm sorry to say. Cage just doesn't feel like the meek type, the milk toast who finds it in himself to take on this group. It's not that his acting is bad but the casting of Cage in this role leaves a lot to be desired.As with any good thriller there are plenty of plot twists going on here. Some you may see coming while others will catch you off guard. All in all it's an entertaining film that will keep you guessing.

While waiting in the hospital, he is approached by a concerned stranger (Guy Pearce) who offers to get justice for his wife in exchange for a favor, sometime in the future.  Distraught, Cage agrees to the vigilante course of action and, within hours, word comes that the rapist has ""committed suicide"".Six months later, Jones has recovered from her physical injuries, yet is still on edge from her horrific experience, when Cage is summoned by Pearce to return the ""favor"" by killing an alleged child pornographer.  And, if he doesn't do it, there will be dire consequences.There are a few surprising plot twists in this fast-moving film, which is actually a lot better than I expected.  True, there are moments where your believability quotient may be slightly strained, but with these kinds of movies, you either go along with them or you don't, and in the case of this Roger Donaldson-directed thriller, the tendency is to just enjoy the ride.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette.

I've also never been too impressed with January Jones who seems restrained in her performance.  I can imagine more assured actors like Christian Bale and Jessica Chastain in the leading roles.

In the hospital Cage is offered a proposition by Pearce ""to take care of this"" (meaning the attacker), in return for some unspecified favor in the future. Cage agrees, and the attacker is murdered. This covers the first 25 min. of the movie, and I really had to struggle to keep my attention. But then a funny thing happens: the ""unspecified favor in return"" becomes a messy situation for Cage, which at first he complies with, but then gets more and more complex and overwhelms Cage.

The latter part of movie reveals all.To be honest, I had low expectations going into this, and I ended up enjoying this more than I expected. At times, though, the acting leaves to be desired.

Mann,"[0, 0]","While Will Gerard (Nicholas Cage) is at the hospital grieving for his wife (January Jones), who has just been raped, a man (Guy Pearce) approaches him, tells him that the rapist's identity is known, and lets him know that if he wants, the man will be taken care of. Naturally, Will is leery, and naturally, he ultimately agrees. (Otherwise, the movie would be very, very short.) All the man tells Will is that later Will might be called upon to grant a favor. Naturally, the favor turns out to be far more than Will expected or wanted.For a movie with a great deal of action, tension, and intrigue, ""Seeking Justice"" is nicely underplayed. Both Cage and Pearce turn in solid performances, modestly understated and thus true to their characters. Will, for example, as a teacher who preaches words rather than violence, does not turn immediately to violence. He, in fact, resists, at least to the degree possible. Pearce's performance is singularly impressive, and his character is all the more frightening because of the understated portrayal. He doesn't rant or rave. He simply states things.""Seeking Justice"" is, in many ways, a combination of two Hitchcock films,Strangers on a TrainandThe Man Who Knew Too Much(though one could substitute any number of ordinary-man-caught-in-intrigue Hitchcock films for the second title). The difference between ""Seeking Justice"" and ""Strangers on a Train"" is really just one of degree. Here, the elements against which Will struggles are broader and better organized.There are, too be sure, a few loose ends at the end of the film, but there aren't as many as I first thought. One problem I had early on was how Pearce's character knew the identity of the rapist when the police did not. The film does not clearly spell out the answer, but I realized later that there is an answer, and it's right there in the film. That point impressed me. It told me that this is a fairly well-crafted film, one with as much thought behind it as brawn.

and Harold Perrineau as Jimmy.This is,I think,a well thought out melodrama and it plays very well.The direction seemed good as did the writing.The nemesis/nemeses in this play are members of the Edmund Burke Society.It's not too often that modern day followers of this 18th century Irish philosopher,extreme right wingers now and founded at the U of Toronto in the late 60s,get an airing.The story comes out of the Big Easy.As it opens we are privy to a recording of someone giving someone,off camera,some seemingly vital information.When that person leaves the room his car is attacked and pushed from one level of a parking lot to one below.The scene switches to Cage and his wife who are celebrating their anniversary.He is a teacher and she a musician.The next night while awaiting his wife to get out of rehearsal at his local,and playing chess with his friend,his wife is brutally raped and beaten.Cage arrives later at the hospital and is beside himself with grief.A man sidles up to him and tells him that he and the organization he works for can take care of this guy,for they know exactly who and where he is.Cage asks what the catch is,and all the man will say is just for a future favour or two.Cage does some soul searching at this vulnerable moment and finally agrees.The hit goes down and Cage is delivered the photo of the dead man along with his wife's stolen neck chain.Life tries to get back to normal,but his wife is still traumatized and it is obvious she will be for some time to come.One day he gets approached by the man who did the dirty for him and asks him to mail a letter at a certain time in front of the zoo.Just as he is about to mail it he gets a call ad is told to open it up.Inside are pictures of a woman and two children,along with a man.He is told to go into the zoo,watch the woman and children and to call him if the man should show up,using the call words&#34;the rabbit jumped&#34;.The man never appears and Cage leaves the zoo.He figures he is done but it is not to be.His contact tells him the man is a pedophile and that they want him to kill him at a certain transit overpass at a certain time of the day.Cage balks at every stage but the pressure is too much,and his wife can see the tension growing.With tires slashed Cage is forced to take a certain bus to the pre-arranged area and get off and wait for the perp.That day he cannot do it and continues on to work.Of course he is followed and contacted again and the next day it starts all over again.This time Cage does get off the bus and waits for the following bus to disgorge the perp in question.Cage waits on the walkway and as the man approaches he calls out his name to talk but the man starts tussling with him instead.The man ends up falling to his death onto a car on the freeway below.Cage flees.Back home Cage's wife has found her neck chain Cage left in his glove compartment and asks for an explanation,which he cannot give.She storms out.A knock soon comes on the door and it is the police;he is busted for the murder of the man on the overpass,whose name differs from the name he was given by his contact.At the station the cops have only partial security footage of Cage leaving the area,not on the actual ramp,which his contact said they would take care of.The two cops grilling him are getting nowhere and a lieutenant comes in alone to speak to him.He pry's the password&#34;the rabbit jumped&#34; out of Cage,and the lieutenant,in on this secret organization also,lets him go free.His freedom however is not official,and the two cops who arrested him put out a warrant for him.Now out and on the run,Cage makes contact with his wife briefly,who is now more informed as to Cage's predicament.Cage starts digging into the identity of the man he tussled with and finds his real name and his occupation:an investigative journalist.He goes to the newspaper he worked for and even goes to his wake,held in an Irish pub.His trail leads him to the dead man's storage locker,where he finds a box with the recording we saw at the beginning of the film,inside it.It now shows he was investigating this secret organization for a story,and the man who was killed after the recording was done,was an insider.Cage also finds the man's phone,which has video of Cage at the zoo.Cage phones his original contact and tells him to meet him at a sports game.There,with the evidence against them,he wants them to leave he and wife alone.But they have since,abducted Cage's wife and have her held in an abandoned mall beside the stadium.This is where the climax will play out as one of Cage's best friends is found out to be a member also.When they threaten to kill Cage and his wife his friend steps in to derail their plans.A shootout occurs with Cage and his wife barely making it out alive.And who should be the investigating officer on the scene,but the police lieutenant.He tells them that they're both free and offers Cage a chance to join them,which he of course declines.The film ends as Cage hands over what evidence he has from the reporters files to his newspaper.The man who takes it and walks away,makes a quick reference back to Cage with&#34;the rabbit jumps&#34;.The film,as you can see,has a lot of twists and turns and many surprises as to who or who doesn't belong to this secret society.It actually is only secret insofar as the general public's knowledge of their existence and activities.Early on his contact explains that&#34;the rabbit jumped&#34; is a reference to a quote from their philosophical leader Edmund Burke.Cage's first meeting with his contact is pivotal in the film.It it his speech to Cage about the justice system and its inequities that finally prompt Cage to finally go along with him.It is also that dialogue that makes or breaks the rest of the movie,for if we do not believe as Cage did,then the rest of the film would have been a sham.But it has just enough truths and half truths in it that we do...at least I did.The acting is all top notch and Cage brings it to this film.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.All in all a nicely done melodrama with an Edmund Burke philosophical twist in it.Well directed and written.Recommended.3 1/2-4 stars.",4,A pleasing melodrama,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,6397,"['Seeking', 'Justice', 'released',

The person helping, who gets revenge for their own suffering (in Nick Cage's case, the rapist of his wife gets bumped off) in exchange for a minor favor, which usually involves murder.When Nick's character resists this, (being told that he would kill a child pornographer - in reality an investigative reporter who is getting too close to the truth) he his hounded by the organization.Plot-Holes!I understood that this organization has infiltrated much more than originally thought, and Nick's acting is pretty spot on, if a bit sympathetic but there are many questions left - why does he go into a hotel and manage to steal a car?  And if he really needed wheels that badly, then why did he not later return the car?  And why were the cops not after him on this?He does not tell his wife any of his dealings until near the end of the movie.  She later becomes a key player, but a bit late in the film.If this organization is so secretive, why does it not just pull its own jobs rather than convince patsies?  Would it not be faster to hire a hit man?Bottom Line:  I got this DVD for free and that's a pretty good deal.  Why spend dough on a story that makes little sense and delivers an unsatisfying ending?

While Seeking Justice is no Kick-Ass, in my opinion Seeking Justice was a severely underrated movie that entertained me from start to finish.And Nick has an excellent supporting cast of recognizable actors that help make Seeking Justice an above average hour and 45 minutes of well spent time. Nick plays a dude whose wife (played byMad Men'sJanuary Jones) is assaulted by a thug. Guy Pierce runs an underground (is there another kind?) vigilante service and offers Nick some ""free help"" to settle the score. But of course nothing is really free, and Nick finds himself in hot water with the vigilante when the vigilante comes knocking for a return favor that Nick isn't very favorable to.The storyline seemed very familiar, and the movie was a bit predictable.

Spoilers - Obviously we find out this 'organization', which at the beginning we are led to believe is very small with only very few people involved. Later, we find out the 'organization' is rather huge including police officers, reporters, NC's own co-workers & the list goes on and on.With such a large organization with so many involved including those (police, reporters etc) who could 'do the job easily', it makes no sense that for 'every kill', they then 'tap that victims family member' to do the 'next kill'.These are just normal people & most simply would not carry out the 'next kill', regardless of 'the favor they owe'. It would all blow up in a hurry as this 'secret & small organization' filled with a 'few select people ready & willing to do the jobs while keeping everything quiet' is actually a huge organization filled with normal people that would ensure it certainly is not quiet.With so many normal, non killers 'doing the jobs' or 'being asked/threatened to', this would not last a month, even with police officers involved to 'help keep it quiet', let alone 10 or more years.No way could they do it as they do & have it last that long. It wouldnt take the 'journalist' or anybody else 10 or more years 'to put the pieces together'...it would take a month before these 'normal people let the cat out of the bag'So, it really made no sense why they had the number of people involved with many 'skilled in killing'..'100% for the cause' & 'dedicated to keeping it quiet', but they then use tons of normal people 'unskilled in killin', 'not dedicated to the cause' & certainly 'not dedicated to keeping things quiet'..in fact, these 'normal people would ensure its anything but quiet/a secret.....But hey, its a movie so no biggie 'it doesnt make logical sense'.But even tho, the movie still seemed rather predictable with it being fairly obvious at the beginning that the 'favor they will ask NC for', is going to be to kill someone.It was also fairly obvious that we would find out there was alot more people involved then 'just a few dedicated citizens' as well as knowing we would find out 'a person/people' close to NC that he knows well, were involved as well & involved in helping to 'screw NC'.But hey, the acting was decent, the plot interesting so was worth watching, but not a movie i'll watch more then once.So, I do rec at least watching it.

This film may have been direct-to-video, but it features one hell of a cast, a ton of action, and a pretty decent storyline. Like most B-movies, this film was predictable as hell, but not in a bad way. Yes, I knew what was coming, but I was still interested in seeing how it was done and what the results would be. Nicholas Cage is actual not the action star of this film, he is merely a High School English Teacher, with a seemingly perfect life. His world gets turned around though when his wife is savagely raped and beaten. As a result, Cage has two options, let the police do their thing or find someone else to take care of business. Can you guess which choice he made? Cage is of course fantastic as always. Even if the particular film doesn't suit your interests, when you see that it stars Nicholas Cage, you know you're about to be entertained. Guy Pierce is also excellent, giving a performance that was eerily similar to that of his character in Memento. Seeking Justice is definitely not an award winning film and is destine to fall under the radar of most moviegoers, but it's just as thrilling and entertaining as anything you'll see at the box office.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...]- @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1227,"['Seeking', 'Justice', 'rare', 'example', 'B-Movie', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'direct-to-video', 'one', 'hell', 'cast', 'ton', 'action', 'pretty', 'decent', 'storyline', 'most', 'B-movies', 'film', 'was', 'predictable', 'hell', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'Yes', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'was', 'still', 'interested', 'seeing', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'what', 'results', 'would', 'be', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'actual', 'not', 'action', 'star', 'film', 'merely', 'High', 'School', 'English', 'Teacher', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'life', 'world', 'turned', 'around', 'when', 'wife', 'savagely', 'raped', 'beaten', 'result', 'Cage', 'two', 'options', 'let', 'police', 'do', 'thing', 'find', 'someone', 'else', 'take', 'care', 'business', 'Can', 'guess', 'choice', 'made', 'Cage', 'course', 'fantastic', 'always', 'Even', 'particular', 'film', ""n't"", 'suit', 'interests', 'when', 'see', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'know', ""'re"", 'be', 'entertained', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'also', 'excellent', 'giving', 'performance', 'was', 'eerily', 'similar', 'character', 'Memento', 'Seeking', 'Justice', 'definitely', 'not', 'award', 'winning', 'film', 'destine', 'fall', 'radar', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'just', 'thrilling', 'entertaining', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'see', 'box', 'office']",N/A

The man, who calls himself ""Simon"" (Guy Pearce), offers a deal to terribly shocked Will, promising him something that Will secretly wants.The banal title aside, the biggest problem of ""Seeking Justice"" is familiarity. Once you get where the film is going (and that happens pretty early on), the film starts to feel sort of ""been there done that."" The potential suspense is undermined by the flat narrative and uninteresting characters (except Pearce's enigmatic ""Simon""). The premise of the thriller looks preposterous even by the standards of B action movies.For all the flaws, I for one enjoyed the film, though, partly because I like Nicolas Cage, and partly because New Orleans locations are cleverly used as a background of the action. As to the film's action, I think Roger Donaldson as director did a decent job. The cat-and-mouse chase on the highway (not a car chase) is brilliantly done.Considering the recent films of the star that tend to be hit or miss (and often the latter), ""Seeking Justice"" is a pretty good thriller, even though there is nothing new or original in it.",3,"""The Hungry Rabbit Jumps"": Decent, if Familiar, Thriller Starring Nicolas Cage",1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,1263,"['When', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Gerard', 'January', 'Jones', 'assaulted', 'street', 'ordinary', 'English', 'teacher', 'Will', 'Gerard', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'approached', 'hospital', 'mysterious', 'man', 'man', 'who', 'Simon', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'deal', 'terribly', 'shocked', 'Will', 'promising', 'something', 'Will', 'secretly', 'banal', 'title', 'aside', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Seeking', 'Justice', 'familiarity', 'Once', 'get', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'pretty', 'early', 'film', 'feel', 'sort', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'potential', 'suspense', 'undermined', 'flat', 'narrative', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'Pearce', 'enigmatic', 'Simon', 'premise', 'thriller', 'preposterous', 'even', 'standards', 'B', 'action', 'movies.For', 'flaws', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'though', 'partly', 'like', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'partly', 'New', 'Orleans', 'locations', 'are', 'cleverly', 'used', 'background', 'action', 'film', 'action', 'think', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'director', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'cat-and-mouse', 'chase', 'highway', 'not', 'car', 'chase', 'brilliantly', 'done.Considering', 'recent', 'films', 'star', 'tend', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'often', 'latter', 'Seeking', 'Justice', 'pretty', 'good', 'thriller', 'even', 'nothing', 'new', 'original']",N/A
