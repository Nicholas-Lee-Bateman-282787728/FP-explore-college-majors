258970,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301628616,David Baldwin,"[30, 32]","Along with ""The Nun's Story"" this has to be the best film made about religious faith and service.  The film covers the life of Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck), a Scottish priest, who by his own account is imperfect.  By acknowleding his own imperfections he is willing to accept his differences with his fellow man.  This mindset serves him well in his assignment as the head of a mission in China at the end of the 19th century.  The Chinese are naturally suspicious of Westerners with their strange customs and religions and Father Chisholm's nature serves him well.  Father Chisholm does not see his role as priest to erect large edifices or register converts.  Rather, he sees his calling as to serve humanity as Christ did.  In a way this film is light years ahead of it's time in it's promotion of ecumenism.  Father Chisholm's work in China is a precedent for the work Mother Teresa did in Calcutta.  In his film debut, Peck delivers probably the best work of his career.  The role requires that he assay sixty years of a man's life and he does so remarkably.  It's all the more impressive when you consider he was 28 at the time.  Good supporting turns by Edmund Gwenn as Chisholm's kindly bishop, Thomas Mitchell as Chisholm's atheistic doctor friend, and Vincent Price as Chisholm's polar opposite in the priesthood.",5,Compelling Film About Serving God and Man,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,1333,"['Nun', 'Story', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'made', 'religious', 'faith', 'service', 'film', 'life', 'Father', 'Francis', 'Chisholm', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Scottish', 'priest', 'who', 'own', 'account', 'imperfect', 'acknowleding', 'own', 'imperfections', 'willing', 'accept', 'differences', 'fellow', 'man', 'mindset', 'well', 'assignment', 'head', 'mission', 'China', 'end', '19th', 'century', 'Chinese', 'are', 'naturally', 'suspicious', 'Westerners', 'strange', 'customs', 'religions', 'Father', 'Chisholm', 'nature', 'well', 'Father', 'Chisholm', 'not', 'see', 'role', 'priest', 'erect', 'large', 'edifices', 'register', 'converts', 'Rather', 'calling', 'serve', 'humanity', 'Christ', 'did', 'way', 'film', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'promotion', 'ecumenism', 'Father', 'Chisholm', 'work', 'China', 'precedent', 'work', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'did', 'Calcutta', 'film', 'debut', 'Peck', 'probably', 'best', 'work', 'career', 'role', 'sixty', 'years', 'man', 'life', 'so', 'remarkably', 'more', 'impressive', 'when', 'consider', 'was', '28', 'time', 'Good', 'supporting', 'turns', 'Edmund', 'Gwenn', 'Chisholm', 'kindly', 'bishop', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'Chisholm', 'atheistic', 'doctor', 'friend', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Chisholm', 'polar', 'opposite', 'priesthood']",N/A

258975,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6301628616,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM (1944, 137 minutes) is Gregory Peck's early tour-de-force. As Father Francis, a humble and open-minded Scottish Catholic priest working mission in southern China, I think this film may be the one that catapulted Peck into icon status.About 95% of this film is a flashback to Fr. Francis' entire life. Played beautifully as a child by an adolescent Roddy McDowall, later in the film Peck takes over the role as an enthusiastic college student ~ and successfully ages into a very old man throughout the course of the film. The great acting, superior quality overall (at certain points it seems like a newly-made film) ~ this has everything that makes it a timeless, gorgeous classic.An iconic image I cannot erase from my mind is seeing Fr. Francis wearing a traditional Chinese robe (sometimes known as a ""cheong-sam""), which he wears throughout most of the film. It reminded me of how often we see those robes in modern martial arts films, so I was simply stunned to see Gregory Peck wearing one in 1944. It was brought back, exactly as Peck wears it, as a fashion statement by Donnie Yen in the title role of the crummy biopic IP MAN.This made me realise Peck's character is more Chinese than anything.One complaint I must air (and it is not the portrayal of the Chinese, because after all, only Chinese actors played Chinese roles in this). No, it is the horrible butchering of the lovely Scots accent. The only one to do it right was Edmund Gwenn, the only Englishman in the cast aside from Hardwicke and of Scots descent. Everyone else alternated between some kind of mutilated Irish-sounding goop and American. It was funny to see a Scottish village so populated by Brooklynites!The stellar cast here includes the marvelous, always sympathetic Edmund Gwenn as Bishop Hamish MacNabb, Vincent Price as Francis' childhood pal Monsignor Angus Mealy, the great Thomas Mitchell as Fr. Francis' other childhood pal, Dr. Willie Tulloch. (Mitchell was the first major actor to play Lieutenant Columbo, for any such geeks out there who might be reading.) Further talents including Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Rosa Stradner, and Peggy Ann Garner.Never to be forgotten are the great Chinese extras in the film, two greats whom we all know so well: Philip Ahn and Benson Fong. Those guys are among my lifelong favorite actors along with Keye Luke (who is not in this film).TRIVIAL FLOTSAM AND JETSAM: This film as far as I know was the 3rd film in what has become ""the Catholic Church genre"". Starting withThe Song Of BernadetteandGoing My Way, KEYS was the 3rd Catholic-oriented film in the years 1943-1944. Wonderful examples of the genre and the way it has affected America can be seen in films such as Spencer Tracy's portrayal of Fr. Flanagan inBoys Town, his first priest role; the silly yet somehow compellingThe Devil at 4 O'clock, Tracy's last priest role; and a 1983 Peck vehicle, the true story about a priest fighting the Nazis inThe Scarlet and the Black.With all these wonderful films (well, some not so wonderful) the Catholic film floodgates opened. This has carried right through to the present day, and the genre has thus evolved something like this: wholesome drama>suspense (I Confess, remember?)>silly comedy (thankfully not exploited too early)>ugly paranormal/horror.Even in THE SCARLET AND THE BLACK, we have Sir John Gielgud in his last role as pope, here Pope Pius XII. He first played a pope inThe Shoes of the Fisherman, the fictitious Pope Pius XIII. So there are links to be seen everywhere, but none better than Katharine Hepburn's wonderful yellowface performance as a Chinese peasant farm girl inDragon Seed [VHS], originally written by Pearl S. Buck and released the same year as KEYS, 1944. (As a further sidebar, I find it fascinating that Hepburn, the lady holding the record for most Oscars, never got so much as a nod for playing Jade in this great film.)A later film most reminiscent of KEYS is Otto Preminger'sThe Cardinal, which sort of bombed yet is also a fine, iconic classic.

And as the story revolves around the life of an independent-minded, compassionate priest who volunteers for missionary work in China, I was taken both by Peck's performance and the character he was charged to portray. Being a film of the '40s, it is in glorious black and white - another point in its favor (to me). However, you'll find the &#34;special&#34; effects also truly '40s. The film was made during World War II, and Hollywood budgets, like those of most industries, were restricted by wartime priorities. But the story is the star of this film, and Peck did it justice (as evidenced by his best-actor Oscar nomination), as did the actors in the other major roles (Thomas Mitchell, Vincent Price, Edmund Gwenn, Benson Fong, and Rose Stradner).

Miller ""revdochr""","[1, 3]","Gregory Peck, the supposedly inept priest becomes the kindly Christ-like spiritual shepherd to a group of Chinese peasants and is finally recognized for what he is in the last reel.  It's a familiar formula, one Ingrid Bergman did with a larger screen, and color to boot, in ""Inn of the Sixth Happiness.""  They are wholesome, they are touching, they even bring a tear to the eye.  But unfortunately they are so predictable.  Hollywood has always gone for the wholesome and the touching and the spiritually uplifting, knowing perhaps that audiences wouldn't buy any other product.  I, for one, would like to see a little more tension in the story, a little more ambiguity, a priest who isn't quite so sure of himself, a congregation that maintains a healthy skepticism about its shepherd, even as it hungers for the real article so rarely encountered, and too often punished and destroyed when discovered.  I remember one such film: Humphrey Bogart playing a bogus priest on the lam in China, forced to enact the real thing in spite of himself.  ""The Left Hand of God"" peaked my curiosity and left an impression.  But that was so many years ago, memory may be deceiving me.  I just wish it was available on DVD for me to see again.  It may be no better than the rest, but it's nice to think about the possibility.Meanwhile, if you like wholesome and uplifting and the story of a good man who manages not only to stay good but helps a whole bunch of people who obviously need helping, ""The Keys of the Kingdom"" is a safe bet.

Neither seem at the outset to be the stuff of sainthood: both roughhewn men, stumbling often as they try to follow Christ's teachings.Peck plays a Scottish priest who is a missionary to China just before (and then during) the Revolution. His early life, as played by Roddy McDowell, is fraught with hardships and disappointments--he can never measure up to a fellow priest played by Vincent Price, who seems destined to be a shooting star in the hierarchy. But he finds a friend in the old bishop, played by Edmund Gwenn. Eventually Peck finds his way to China, and we see his struggles to carve out a parish mission there, until he is fortunate enough to gain a major patron who deeds him a large parcel of land. And so Peck lives his missionary life, surviving imperious sisters, natural disasters, civil war, and even a visit from Vincent Price. This is one of the pictures that used to make me cry, and I'm sure I'm not alone in that category.

259001,A3F0AFTVKFAMZZ,6301628616,Marvin D. Pipher,"[1, 2]","Many of Hollywood's leading men --- such as Eddie Albert, Lew Ayres, Gene Autry, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Henry Fonda, Clark Gable, Robert Montgomery, Wayne Morris, and Ronald Reagan --- volunteered, were drafted, or were called up from the reserves to serve their country during World War II.  This set the stage for many new faces to supplant them while they were away for the duration.  One such actor was Gregory Peck; and this, his second film, is the one which catapulted him to fame and fortune.  That alone makes this an important film.The film tells its story in much the same way as that told in the truly great film, ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941).  In this instance, however, it is told with reference to a journal kept by an aging priest who was being put out to pasture; rather than from the perspective of an old man looking back on his childhood's valley.  In the main, the story told is that of a young priest who, although uncertain of his calling, nevertheless volunteers for service in a remote and poverty-stricken province in the interior of China in the late 1800s.  As the plot unfolds one can see how he grows in faith and wisdom, and eventually is not only successful in his mission, but is beloved by the people whom he has come to serve.I suspect that movie-goers in 1944 saw Gregory Peck quite differently than one might view him today.  Clearly, he was a virtual unknown at that time, so it would have been easy for that audience to suspend reality and accept Peck as the Father Francis Chisholm he was portraying.  Looking at the film today, however, in light of Peck's long body of work, it seems to me that he was miscast in this role.  He simply isn't convincing, making it difficult to get lost in the plot.  I also had one other misgiving regarding the film.  Peck's various superiors --- particularly those played by Edmund Gwenn & Vincent Price --- seem rather contrived; almost caricatures of men of the cloth.So, my conclusion is that this is a good but not a great film.  But it is one which anyone who enjoys old-time movies should enjoy, especially those younger viewers who are unfamiliar with Gregory Peck and his work.",3,A good but not a great film,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,2164,"['Many', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'men', 'such', 'Eddie', 'Albert', 'Lew', 'Ayres', 'Gene', 'Autry', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Jr.', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'Wayne', 'Morris', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'volunteered', 'were', 'drafted', 'were', 'called', 'up', 'reserves', 'serve', 'country', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'set', 'stage', 'many', 'new', 'supplant', 'were', 'away', 'duration', 'One', 'such', 'actor', 'was', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'second', 'film', 'one', 'catapulted', 'fame', 'fortune', 'alone', 'important', 'film.The', 'film', 'story', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'told', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'How', 'Green', 'Was', 'My', 'Valley', '1941', 'instance', 'however', 'told', 'reference', 'journal', 'kept', 'aging', 'priest', 'who', 'was', 'being', 'put', 'out', 'pasture', 'rather', 'perspective', 'old', 'man', 'looking', 'back', 'childhood', 'valley', 'main', 'story', 'told', 'young', 'priest', 'who', 'uncertain', 'calling', 'nevertheless', 'volunteers', 'service', 'remote', 'poverty-stricken', 'province', 'interior', 'China', 'late', '1800s', 'plot', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'faith', 'wisdom', 'eventually', 'not', 'only', 'successful', 'mission', 'beloved', 'people', 'whom', 'come', 'serve.I', 'suspect', 'movie-goers', '1944', 'saw', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'quite', 'differently', 'one', 'might', 'view', 'today', 'Clearly', 'was', 'virtual', 'unknown', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'audience', 'suspend', 'reality', 'accept', 'Peck', 'Father', 'Francis', 'Chisholm', 'was', 'portraying', 'Looking', 'film', 'today', 'however', 'light', 'Peck', 'long', 'body', 'work', 'was', 'miscast', 'role', 'simply', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'making', 'difficult', 'get', 'lost', 'plot', 'also', 'had', 'one', 'other', 'misgiving', 'regarding', 'film', 'Peck', 'various', 'superiors', 'particularly', 'played', 'Edmund', 'Gwenn', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'seem', 'rather', 'contrived', 'almost', 'caricatures', 'men', 'cloth.So', 'conclusion', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'anyone', 'who', 'old-time', 'movies', 'should', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'younger', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'work']",N/A

Gregory Peck's ""unorthodox beliefs"" are petty issues, not having to do with Church dogma, etc... and it's basically pitting a humble, Saintly man against Church leaders who are only interested in ""numbers"" of converts and their own rise to power. So I think a more accurate description would be that THEY were unorthodox, not this lovely, humble priest.It's the story of a priest who has a really hard time with the people he has come to convert and help: How hard it is to be accepted by them, and the way that God works through him and them to change the hearts of the people, the people who become so dear to this wonderful priest in the end. A really uplifting, wonderful story that I highly recommend.Some notes for parents: there are obvious cultural issues in China that are dealt with, nothing major, but there is a difference in religions. Some classic war scenes, nothing obnoxious or obvious but they are there, and during one the priest actually joins in to defend. There are lower Church officials shown in a negative way, although there are plenty shown positively too, so I would say that's a fair depiction. There is a mention of the story of a young lady who makes the wrong choices in life and has a child out of it, who then passes away. Those are the things I can think of off the top of my head. All of these are minor things and I suggest that you watch the movie with the entire family.

Gregory Peck plays this role excellently. When the priest reaches land he is greeted with anger and someone throws a rock at his face. A young man comes over to help the priest and they become good friends. The Ruler of these Chinese people comes to the priest asking him to cure his son. He goes to the Ruler's house and makes an ointment to put onto the boy. As he is doing this the Ruler and the people who are there watching give strange looks on their faces as if to say they don't believe in this. The next day the boy is cured, which brings joy to the Ruler and the people. Nuns arrive and start a school. The young Chinese friend of the priest takes him to where the church once stood, which is almost level to the ground because of an attack during World War 2. Soon all of the community comes to help rebuild the church. Time passes and the priest has grown older. Vincent Price, playing the role of another priest tells the priest that he has to leave and go back to the US. The people are saddened when they hear this and so is the priest because he and the people have drawn close together. One of the clergy that is higher up than the priest decides to let the priest stay, so the clergy leaves and the joy of the people to have the priest stay is a fitting climax to this movie.The movie is heartwarming and as I watched it I quickly made Gregory Peck my favorite actor. This movie touched me deeply. I am glad to have this movie among my collection as it truly is a classic.

To see him at his best, check out his scene with the Town Judge as he accepts the job as defense attorney, Atticus Finch, in ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""A lot of the Roman Catholic religion is toned down in this piece for the sake of palatability. Having done so, the movie makers have made a touching human drama out of missionary work in the Far East. It deals with some of the cultural differences from an ignorant 1950's Western point of view, but somehow this does not end up spoiling the film.In the end, the shortcomings of the church are not glossed over, while the good actions of good men within the obviously flawed institution are highlighted to good effect. It is a story of Godly love overcoming all weaknesses in the heart of a ""failure"" of the priesthood. While others within the church go on to personal fame and glory--like his close boyhood friend, played by Vincent Price--our hero soldiers on in anonymity where the ""missionary rubber meets the road"", so to speak.Overall, this movie does not deny the shortcomings of many in the church, while simultaneously revealing the work of those who do Christ proud.
