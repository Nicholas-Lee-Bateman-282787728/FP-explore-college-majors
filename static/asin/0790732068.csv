98957,A52X1I4UT56KL,0790732068,"Amazon Customer ""debater7""","[11, 12]","Based on a true story of a historic outbreak of racist violence, ""Rosewood"" is a compelling movie even without the social significance.  The storyline is basically that a white woman falsely accuses a black man of rape, causing a whole town to go nuts.  Certain of the white citizens form a mob to administer ""justice"" and end up on a rampage, while 2 men try to hide the black citizens of the town and help them escape.""Rosewood"" has many of the same emotional elements (heroism, cowardice, hatred, loss of control vs. disciplined honor, plenty of emotional tension) of ""Schindler's List"" or the old version of ""Titanic,"" ""A Night to Remember.""  Director John Singleton keeps the action moving, by keeping the more sensitive scenes short, and actually increasing their impact by his brevity.John Voight is very believable as a reluctant hero, playing a shopkeeper who risks losing everything to help the terrified women and children of the town.  Ving Rhames does a good job as a black man returned from war who serve's as Voight's conscience and handles the action scenes.A surprise stand-out is Bruce McGill (D-Day in Animal House, the sheriff in My Cousin Vinny) as the ""leader"" of the white mob.  McGill is convincing as one of the most disgusting characters I've ever seen on film.  He brings out the truly foul nature of hate, but manages to humanize his character by showing the personal costs of his hate as well as the social forces which led him to it.  The result is that you think he actually is the character he portrays.  The movie is worth it just for McGill's creepy character.",5,"Tragic history, great story.",1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,1594,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'historic', 'outbreak', 'racist', 'violence', 'Rosewood', 'compelling', 'movie', 'even', 'social', 'significance', 'storyline', 'basically', 'white', 'woman', 'falsely', 'black', 'man', 'rape', 'causing', 'whole', 'town', 'go', 'nuts', 'Certain', 'white', 'citizens', 'form', 'mob', 'administer', 'justice', 'end', 'up', 'rampage', '2', 'men', 'try', 'hide', 'black', 'citizens', 'town', 'help', 'escape', 'Rosewood', 'many', 'same', 'emotional', 'elements', 'heroism', 'cowardice', 'hatred', 'loss', 'control', 'vs.', 'disciplined', 'honor', 'plenty', 'emotional', 'tension', 'Schindler', 'List', 'old', 'version', 'Titanic', 'A', 'Night', 'Remember', 'Director', 'John', 'Singleton', 'action', 'moving', 'keeping', 'more', 'sensitive', 'scenes', 'short', 'actually', 'increasing', 'impact', 'brevity.John', 'Voight', 'very', 'believable', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'playing', 'shopkeeper', 'who', 'losing', 'everything', 'help', 'terrified', 'women', 'children', 'town', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'good', 'job', 'black', 'man', 'returned', 'war', 'who', 'serve', 'Voight', 'conscience', 'action', 'scenes.A', 'surprise', 'stand-out', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'D-Day', 'Animal', 'House', 'sheriff', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Vinny', 'leader', 'white', 'mob', 'McGill', 'convincing', 'one', 'most', 'disgusting', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'out', 'truly', 'foul', 'nature', 'hate', 'humanize', 'character', 'showing', 'personal', 'costs', 'hate', 'as', 'well', 'social', 'forces', 'led', 'result', 'think', 'actually', 'character', 'movie', 'just', 'McGill', 'creepy', 'character']",N/A

Unfortunately, it was not well received at the time - in fact, I found it really difficult to find a theatre that featured the film.  Much like ""Roots"", this is a pivital movie, giving the viewers a snapshot of true events that occurred in Florida in 1922.  Of course some artistic license is taken.  At times, Vingh Raimes seems more like a super hero character....but the racist attitudes of the period seem to be accurately represented.  One other note, I just read the rant about republicans verses democrats and I have this to say.  It's funny how in modern times the republican party seems to celebrate the ""retro"" sensibilities of the 1950's when blacks just happened to be forced to ride on the back of the bus and received separate and unequal schooling. And when blacks also provided cheap labor as 2nd class citizens for whites who wanted to maintain their status as 1st class citizens of these United States....funny, no one really ever talks about how that power structure provided a world for middle class whites to flourish in before the modern civil rights movement took hold....a lopsided world missed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy, but I digress....Anyway, the author of that rant fails to mention that during the 1960's, racist ""Dixiecrats"" like Strom Thurmond left the democratic party to join with the republicans who accepted him with open arms. And recently before his death, Strom was celebrated by fellow republican Trent Lott who wished aloud that Strom had been president. - When I lived in Texas, the people I knew who regularly used racial slurs, and drove around with confederate flag license plates always (and I mean always) claimed to be republican when the subject of politics came up.  The democratic party is no perfect party, but trying to make the republican party seem like a refuge and oasis for blacks just because Abe Lincoln once was a member is just plain ignorant!!!!",5,Excellent Movie!!!!,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,1989,"['watched', 'Rosewood', 'Texas', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1997', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'received', 'time', 'fact', 'found', 'really', 'difficult', 'find', 'theatre', 'featured', 'film', 'Much', 'Roots', 'pivital', 'movie', 'giving', 'viewers', 'snapshot', 'true', 'events', 'occurred', 'Florida', '1922', 'course', 'artistic', 'license', 'taken', 'times', 'Vingh', 'Raimes', 'more', 'super', 'hero', 'character', 'racist', 'attitudes', 'period', 'seem', 'be', 'accurately', 'represented', 'One', 'other', 'note', 'just', 'read', 'rant', 'republicans', 'verses', 'democrats', 'have', 'say', 'funny', 'how', 'modern', 'times', 'republican', 'party', 'celebrate', 'retro', 'sensibilities', '1950', 'when', 'blacks', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'forced', 'ride', 'back', 'bus', 'received', 'separate', 'unequal', 'schooling', 'when', 'blacks', 'also', 'provided', 'cheap', 'labor', '2nd', 'class', 'citizens', 'whites', 'who', 'wanted', 'maintain', 'status', '1st', 'class', 'citizens', 'United', 'States', '.funny', 'one', 'really', 'ever', 'talks', 'how', 'power', 'structure', 'provided', 'world', 'middle', 'class', 'whites', 'flourish', 'modern', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'took', 'hold', '.a', 'lopsided', 'world', 'missed', 'likes', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'G.', 'Gordon', 'Liddy', 'digress', '.Anyway', 'author', 'rant', 'mention', '1960', 'racist', 'Dixiecrats', 'Strom', 'Thurmond', 'left', 'democratic', 'party', 'join', 'republicans', 'who', 'accepted', 'open', 'arms', 'recently', 'death', 'Strom', 'was', 'celebrated', 'fellow', 'republican', 'Trent', 'Lott', 'who', 'wished', 'aloud', 'Strom', 'had', 'been', 'president', 'When', 'lived', 'Texas', 'people', 'knew', 'who', 'regularly', 'used', 'racial', 'slurs', 'drove', 'around', 'confederate', 'flag', 'license', 'always', 'mean', 'always', 'claimed', 'be', 'republican', 'when', 'subject', 'politics', 'came', 'up', 'democratic', 'party', 'perfect', 'party', 'trying', 'make', 'republican', 'party', 'seem', 'refuge', 'oasis', 'blacks', 'just', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'once', 'was', 'member', 'just', 'plain', 'ignorant']",N/A

Mann's (Ving Rhames) character was 200% fiction.  Not even loosely BASED on any historical person.  So the ending, when Mann was shooting at the mob from the train...never happened.2. The emotional distraught of the racist Duke's (Bruce McGill) son, Emmit, was fictional and not based on anything historic.  Added for dramatic purposes obviously.3. Sylvester (Don Cheatle) died in real life during the shootout and did not return heroically on a horse beside the train to pick Mann up.As far as I know, the rest if pretty accurate..In reality, during massacres like Rosewood, the heroes like Mann and Sylvester were the first to die.  But I knew when I saw him escape the lynching, cutting himself down, and shooting at mob when he was escaping on the train that his character was based on ""some"" fiction.  But then I found out his WHOLE character was fictional.  Singleton had to create a hero, or else Black folks would be killing people when the movie was over.  I wouldn't blame them.  I remember I could hardly sleep the night I saw the movie.  And during events like this, not one person faced any charges.  Not one!Jon Voight, as always, gave a hell of a performance.  His character, John Wright, is obviously racist, but not a bigot.  But when he witnesses the lynching of folks he's known for years in his face, he has a change of heart and arranges his friends who owns the train that passes Rosewood to pick up the Black women and children.Michael Rooker, as Sheriff Walker, did a great job as the law who could not control his town.  He, too, was racist, but still wanted order.The Black Preacher in the movie was the typical religious Uncle Tom.  Proving Karl Marx's theory of religion's role in oppressive societies correct (as being the drug to keep oppressed people satisfied with a belief of an after-life).Read about Black Wallstreet too.

Its powerful message sends an eyeopening attack in audiences' hearts.  The filmmakers deserve tremendous respect for deeply exploring these chain of events to such levels.  This was highly necessary for people to understand the impact of violence and racism.  The intensity is so groundbreaking that it forces audiences inside the movie.  Their research is highly obvious, making it very educational.  The movie plot is brilliant, keeping the heart and soul alive in every scene:A small town, Rosewood, is usually a peaceful, loving town.  In New Years Eve 1922, everything functioned as usual.  Around that time, a woman from a nearby town, Sumner, falsely accuses a black person of raping and assaulting her (it was actually a white man, but there was no rape).  Once word is out, all hell breaks loose.The recreation of the town is perfect.  Every detail is flawless, including the styles of the early 1920's.  Every building structure and creation is flawless.  The costume designs are as flawless, looking like actual 1920's clothing.The acting was intensely great.  Everyone offers their own heart and soul sense into this movie, making it more powerful.  Jon Voight and Ving Rhames capitalize the acting talents.  This is Rhames's best role in years.  His tough warrior image never fades for a second, which is very convincing.  His presentd talents were wrongfully overlooked in the 1997 Acadamy Awards for Best Supporting Actor.  Jon Voight's role as a man who comes to terms of what a true ally is.  His heartdrenching role forces audiences to feel his character's learning progress and emotions.&quot;Rosewood&quot; is a great movie for those looking for an factual intense drama.

What a good movie can do is illuminate the  conflict, cast an eye on the suspicious and ultimately destructive forces  that laid seige to the town and set-off a wave of racist brutality.  The  quandry in this sort of movie is how to make a racist unique and avoid  stereotypes. Director John Singleton and screenwriter Gregory Poirer's  answers are inconclusive. Their gun-toting dolts chew ta-ba-kee, toss  around the n-word like a football, and wear suspenders that accentuate  their bloated beer-bellies. For the most part they're not real enough, but  the terror they perpetrate is.Rhames is electrifying in a difficult  role; Voight is all nerves and nuance. John Singleton has, as usual, chosen  a provocative topic. It's a big screen natural. What weakens his work is  his inability to speak for a group while never forgetting the individual.  It's a tough balance, but Singleton's heroes are above reproach and thus  rarely believable. In this often stunning work, racial pride takes  precedence over moral complexity.

During the attack, survivors estimated, as many as eighteen African-Americans and two European-Americans were. Most of the buildings, including churches and a school, were burned. The community was abandoned and, in spite of permanent loss of land and homes, the citizens never returned. Women and children were rescued, as shown in this film, by the crew of the train that regularly stopped at the village. Given the three days of carnage, news of the events reached national newspaper attention. Reporters actually began to arrive on the scene. The governor of Florida was alarmed and asked the nearest local authorities if help was wanted from the National Guard; the sheriff replied that he didn't want help. After the event, the governor did convene an inquest, but no prosecutions or efforts to assist the refugees resulted.Even without further attention from the outside world, the Rosewood Massacre would have been one of the most atrocious and obvious acts of ethnic/racial ""cleansing"" in America's history. In 1992, however, a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times uncovered evidence of the fate of Rosewood and published a story. That story led to national scrutiny. In 1993, aged survivors descendants of survivors of the Massacre sued the state of Florida for compensation. Confronted by undeniable evidence, the Florida Legislature passed a compensation bill of $2,100,000 and established a scholarship fund for Rosewood descendants. Public opinion in Florida was incensed at such acknowledgement of racism in the state's past; letters written to the legislators ran ten to one against any compensation or recognition of the truth.Events in Rosewood in 1923 were probably far less picturesque than those shown in this film. Jon Voight does a splendid job of acting in the role of a white store-keeper caught between his own safety and his humanity. Ving Rhames is almost persuasive in his role as the ""lone ranger"" WW1 veteran -- the African-American stranger who rescues the children. Don Cheadle is impressive as the Rosewood music teacher who decides to fight back. ""Mr. Mann"" is fictional, but perhaps only cinematographic fiction can begin to suggest the horror that the citizens of Rosewood experienced when their fellow Americans decided to wipe their community off the face of the Earth.",5,Too Painful to Watch Alone...,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,2647,"['mitigation', 'Hollywood', 'love', 'story', 'fictitious', 'super-hero', 'still', 'not', 'as', 'painful', 'TRUTH', 'true', 'well-documented', 'story', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'Florida', '1923', 'when', 'several', 'days', 'European-American', 'mobs', 'attacked', 'peaceful', 'prosperous', 'African-American', 'village', 'Rosewood', 'Levy', 'County', 'attack', 'survivors', 'estimated', 'as', 'many', 'eighteen', 'African-Americans', 'two', 'European-Americans', 'were', 'Most', 'buildings', 'including', 'churches', 'school', 'were', 'burned', 'community', 'was', 'abandoned', 'spite', 'permanent', 'loss', 'land', 'homes', 'citizens', 'never', 'returned', 'Women', 'children', 'were', 'rescued', 'shown', 'film', 'crew', 'train', 'regularly', 'stopped', 'village', 'Given', 'three', 'days', 'carnage', 'news', 'events', 'reached', 'national', 'newspaper', 'attention', 'Reporters', 'actually', 'began', 'arrive', 'scene', 'governor', 'Florida', 'was', 'alarmed', 'asked', 'nearest', 'local', 'authorities', 'help', 'was', 'wanted', 'National', 'Guard', 'sheriff', 'replied', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'help', 'event', 'governor', 'did', 'convene', 'inquest', 'prosecutions', 'efforts', 'assist', 'refugees', 'resulted.Even', 'further', 'attention', 'outside', 'world', 'Rosewood', 'Massacre', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'atrocious', 'obvious', 'acts', 'ethnic/racial', 'cleansing', 'America', 'history', '1992', 'however', 'reporter', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'Times', 'uncovered', 'evidence', 'fate', 'Rosewood', 'published', 'story', 'story', 'led', 'national', 'scrutiny', '1993', 'aged', 'survivors', 'descendants', 'survivors', 'Massacre', 'sued', 'state', 'Florida', 'compensation', 'Confronted', 'undeniable', 'evidence', 'Florida', 'Legislature', 'passed', 'compensation', 'bill', '2,100,000', 'established', 'scholarship', 'fund', 'Rosewood', 'descendants', 'Public', 'opinion', 'Florida', 'was', 'incensed', 'such', 'acknowledgement', 'racism', 'state', 'past', 'letters', 'written', 'legislators', 'ran', 'ten', 'one', 'compensation', 'recognition', 'truth.Events', 'Rosewood', '1923', 'were', 'probably', 'far', 'less', 'picturesque', 'shown', 'film', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'splendid', 'job', 'acting', 'role', 'white', 'store-keeper', 'caught', 'own', 'safety', 'humanity', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'almost', 'persuasive', 'role', 'lone', 'ranger', 'WW1', 'veteran', 'African-American', 'stranger', 'who', 'children', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'impressive', 'Rosewood', 'music', 'teacher', 'who', 'fight', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Mann', 'fictional', 'perhaps', 'only', 'cinematographic', 'fiction', 'can', 'begin', 'suggest', 'horror', 'citizens', 'Rosewood', 'experienced', 'when', 'fellow', 'Americans', 'decided', 'wipe', 'community', 'face', 'Earth']",N/A

But you know what i can't condem all white people as being this way because that's rediculoues. Yesterday or today i was watching the Movie ""Tears of the Sun"" Staring bruce willous and i don't know the whole story but my main focus was on these soilders that were white and there was a black dude in there also that were fighting some kind of war and i wish i knew what it was about but what i was looking at mostly in my mind and what i saw in the movie was these white soilders fighting to save these Libyan black people from these disgusting black libyan soilders that were killing the civilans for some reason. And i asked my self while i was watching this would i do the same thing for people that were white and it was a quick answer and they answer was yes. It kinda shocked me because it was no longer about white and black it was about right and wrong. The answer is i would without hesitating. If it was white people that were slaves in america under black people i would kill black slave owners and fight in a civil war to free white people in this country or any other.

""A New Yorker""","[5, 5]","Director John Singleton, of ""Boyz N the Hood"" fame, does a top-notch job throughout this two and a half hour film of conveying the building and inevitable terror of what is to come, and of then sustaining that terror. Visually, he's a master storyteller. The trigger was a white woman, beaten black and blue by her lover. To explain the bruises to her husband, she claims that a black intruder worked her over. Never mind that her housekeepers saw perfectly well who did it. And that he wasn't black. Forget due process. In short order, strange fruit was hanging high and blood lust for more was in the air. When one of the housekeepers finally stepped forward to try to quell the tide of violence by telling what she saw, well, suffice to say that no good deed goes unpunished. Ultimately, Rosewood was reduced to ashes.I consider this film one of those that you might not necessarily want to see, but you need to.  Because it's that necessary harsh kind of art, another example of which that readily leaps to mind is Alice Walker's book, Possessing the Secret of Joy.  Based on a true story, this is Singleton's intrepid of the destruction of Rosewood, an all-black town in Florida.  The incident occurred in 1923 and the film gets kudos all the way around.  First of all, the script by Poirier is dead-on, giving you characters that have significant depth to them.  Singleton directs the material well, helping to make you care about these people before the insanity begins.  And the good news is that the cast is superb and definitely up to the challenge.  Rhames, always an SDI favorite, shows that he can carry a leading role as the enigmatic Mann, a veteran who shows up just in time to try to facilitate some of Rosewood's citizens surviving the onslaught.  Voight is in fine form as well as a store owner in Rosewood who is uncertain where his loyalties lie when the bullets start flying.  Cheadle gets points as well as the proud Sylvester who knows when it's time to stop talking.  The strength of this film is that it's brutally honest about the intrepid that it's providing.The inhumanity is not glamorized or backed away from, it's put in front of you with the understanding that you're there to witness it and learn.  It also provides an important lesson in racism, and how the belief system functions, by being passed down from generation to generation.

98977,A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW,0790732068,John K. Reed,"[66, 70]","It could be argued that some of the black characters are far from above reproach.  Esther Rolle's decision not to report the incident, Ving Rhames' (and others) desire to initially run from the conflict, or you could look  at the promiscuity of Don Cheadle's sister's character who has an  adulterous affair with Jon Voight.  Superficially these may appear to be  character flaws.  That is unless you account for the reality of pervasive  racism that  exists in America (forget about just the South) by both the  general populous and public officials in particular.  The harsh truth is  that black people didn't have the luxury to be (much) less than virtuous as  it could too often result in imprisonment, financial ruin, beatings or  lynchings.  And even with all of the so called virtue exhibited by the  black characters an accusation by a white woman was accepted even in lieu  of truths known by other white characters.  If that could happen to  characters who were above reproach I hate to imagine what would have  happened to less virtuous characters.  If they were virtuous it's only  because their very survival depended on it.  This theme has repeated itself  all too often and all too recently for a thinking individual to believe  that these types of incidents couldn't happen today.The most deplorable  fact is how long it took for the government to even acknowledge the horror  and injustice of this and other events such as the destruction of Black  Wall Street in Kansas City.  That is another element of why blacks so often  had to conduct themselves in a seemingly reproachless manner.And Mr.  Singleton need not be criticized for the 'stereotypical' portrayals of  southern racists.  It was and is accurate.  Just as it's accurate to  demonstrate that there were and are whites who were fair minded and  exhibited tremendous bravery of their own account.There is nothing  'happy' about this movie at all.  Look at the countless number of lives  that were either ruined or ended because of our collective disease.  The  final conflict underscores the real tragedy that racism is.  It destroys  the lives and humanity of all it's participant's be they perpetrators or  victims.  How many children lost their parents?  How many individuals lost  their livelihood or savings?  How many families were destroyed?That  notwithstanding it is a monumental achievment for Mr. Singleton if not  necessarily a cinematic masterpiece.  But who ever said that history has to  be exiciting or uplifting?  It's just what is.  For that Mr. Singleton  deserves the highest commendation just to get a film of this nature made  let alone telling a too often suppressed and ignored part of our history.

There's lots of filler, including hints of a very unnecessary romance, but the action scenes; if black people being lynched, shot and hung qualifies as such; are generally worth the wait.

It's a historical drama, a social/political film, a character study, an exploration in the worst & best in human behavior, & a downright great action film!I call this film ""A Later Day Western"" for several reasons.  First, it has a historical setting.  (Obviously, however, since it takes place in the '20's & NOT in the West, it can't rightfully be called a ""Western"", but I'll get to the similarities in a second!)  Second, like many great westerns, it examines social problems in a historical setting.  Third, though it has ""heroes"" & ""villains"", the good-guys aren't all good (Voight has serious character flaws & is gripped by fear, but he ultimately does ""the right thing"") & the bad-guys have real ""human"" motivations.  (The villain of the story is a dysfunctional, but loving father.)  Finally, The Ving Rhames character (admittedly, a fictional character), is a strong-willed, wandering veteran (on horse-back), trying to find peace, but reluctantly forced to make a stand for right.The story is based loosely on the actual Rosewood Massacres of 1923 & it delivers on all counts.My personal favorite character is John Voight's young (2nd) wife, who stands up to the bigots & earns the respect of her step-children.This film, unlike many other films about race-prejudice, is BALANCED, showing not just ""bad rednecks"", but decent (Caucasian) neighbors of the local African-americans being (unjustly) persecuted for a ""rape"" of a white woman (which, by the way, never really happened.)  This movie reminded me of both ""Bad Day At Black Rock"" & ""To Kill A Mockingbird.""  Those were two great films & by combining elements from them with a real historical event (tragedy) with a strong cast, good script, & fast-paced direction makes for a great film!It's too bad that this film wasn't a bigger hit.

99001,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,0790732068,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[1, 16]","Director John Singleton gets his opportunity to direct an epic black film in Rosewood and define himself as a black director. Unfortunately in this clumsy, clunky incomplete mess of a movie he shows us why he will never measure up to the high standards of black filmmaking Spike Lee established years ago with his definitive films, Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X.The devil is in the details and they are a lot missing in Rosewood. In this story about a successful black town, the story focuses way too much on the white characters. A better director and screenwriter would have shown us a blanked and clear picture of what life was like in Rosewood Florida. I wanted to know why the African Americans lived in the town why they wanted to come there, what jobs they did, and who they were. Unfortunately Singleton doesn't answer any of these questions. Instead, he glosses over these details and gives us a hazy picture of a town that looks like any other in Jim Crow America. Worse he fills it with one-dimensional stock black characters. We get the old mammy, the schoolmarm, the angry black businessman and the new guy in town trying to start a new life for himself.  Even the white characters come off like White Southern stereotypes. The liberal shopkeeper, the redneck killer, the nervous sheriff, the indifferent judge and the evil white woman get a lot of screen time but do nothing with it. The story completely starts to fall apart after the white woman lies about the rape. The white characters go on a campy lynching rampage that is reminiscent of Godzilla destroying Tokyo; it's sad that John Singletons inept direction trivializes the tragic deaths of African Americans who were lynched during this era. This film is supposed to be based on real life events and real people and they are treated like action movie fodder by Singleton.  People we're supposed to care about die, but I didn't get to feel that way because I never got to know anyone because Singleton forgot to let us get to know anyone well enough in the first act of the film. The surviving women and children try to escape the rampage by hiding in the swamp. The remainder of the film devolves into a Jerry Bruckhiemer production as stuff burns up real good and we get a big chase scene as they try to get on a train out of town.  The part of the film that angers me most is the scene where the Ving Rhames character is being lynched. He tells his horse Booker T to go and then allows himself to be hung; however while being strangled he miraculously cuts himself down and escapes. This one scene shows us why Singleton will never be a great filmmaker; instead of giving us powerful visuals in a compelling story he treats the source material like a joke. This was supposed to be a film about real people who lived and died in a tragedy not some over the top action flick like Lethal Weapon.It's a pity that great actors like Ving Rhames, Jon Voight, Don Cheadle and the Late Esther Rolle had to work with Singleton on this project. They give good performances in spite of the shallow material. I wonder what they could have done with a better-written script and a more competent director. The material itself was very interesting and the project had a lot of potential. In the hands of Spike Lee, James Cameron, or Steven Spielberg this truly could have been an epic film. With them directing the film we would have gotten a clear picture of who the people were and what life was like in Rosewood Florida. For John Singleton this is truly a definitive film.  When given the tools to make a great film he makes something awful. This is not his Roots. This shows why he needs to go back to film school and learn the roots of filmmaking.",3,Good storym aterial that falls apart due to Bad execution.,1072396800,"12 26, 2003",2003,3715,"['Director', 'John', 'Singleton', 'opportunity', 'direct', 'epic', 'black', 'film', 'Rosewood', 'define', 'black', 'director', 'Unfortunately', 'clumsy', 'clunky', 'incomplete', 'mess', 'movie', 'why', 'will', 'never', 'measure', 'up', 'high', 'standards', 'black', 'filmmaking', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'established', 'years', 'ago', 'definitive', 'films', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Malcolm', 'X.The', 'devil', 'details', 'are', 'lot', 'missing', 'Rosewood', 'story', 'successful', 'black', 'town', 'story', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'white', 'characters', 'better', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'blanked', 'clear', 'picture', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'Rosewood', 'Florida', 'wanted', 'know', 'why', 'African', 'Americans', 'lived', 'town', 'why', 'wanted', 'come', 'there', 'what', 'jobs', 'did', 'who', 'were', 'Unfortunately', 'Singleton', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'Instead', 'details', 'hazy', 'picture', 'town', 'other', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'America', 'one-dimensional', 'stock', 'black', 'characters', 'get', 'old', 'mammy', 'schoolmarm', 'angry', 'black', 'businessman', 'new', 'guy', 'town', 'trying', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'Even', 'white', 'characters', 'come', 'White', 'Southern', 'stereotypes', 'liberal', 'shopkeeper', 'redneck', 'killer', 'nervous', 'sheriff', 'indifferent', 'judge', 'evil', 'white', 'woman', 'get', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'do', 'nothing', 'story', 'completely', 'fall', 'apart', 'white', 'woman', 'rape', 'white', 'characters', 'go', 'campy', 'lynching', 'rampage', 'reminiscent', 'Godzilla', 'destroying', 'Tokyo', 'sad', 'John', 'Singletons', 'inept', 'direction', 'tragic', 'deaths', 'African', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'lynched', 'era', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'treated', 'action', 'movie', 'fodder', 'Singleton', 'People', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'care', 'die', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'feel', 'way', 'never', 'got', 'know', 'anyone', 'Singleton', 'forgot', 'let', 'get', 'know', 'anyone', 'well', 'enough', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'surviving', 'women', 'children', 'try', 'escape', 'rampage', 'hiding', 'swamp', 'remainder', 'film', 'Jerry', 'Bruckhiemer', 'production', 'stuff', 'up', 'real', 'good', 'get', 'big', 'chase', 'scene', 'try', 'get', 'train', 'town', 'part', 'film', 'angers', 'most', 'scene', 'where', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'character', 'being', 'lynched', 'horse', 'Booker', 'T', 'go', 'then', 'be', 'hung', 'however', 'being', 'strangled', 'miraculously', 'down', 'escapes', 'one', 'scene', 'why', 'Singleton', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'instead', 'giving', 'powerful', 'visuals', 'compelling', 'story', 'source', 'material', 'joke', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'film', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'died', 'tragedy', 'not', 'top', 'action', 'flick', 'Lethal', 'Weapon.It', 'pity', 'great', 'actors', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Late', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'had', 'work', 'Singleton', 'project', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'spite', 'shallow', 'material', 'wonder', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better-written', 'script', 'more', 'competent', 'director', 'material', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'project', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'hands', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'truly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'epic', 'film', 'directing', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'clear', 'picture', 'who', 'people', 'were', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'Rosewood', 'Florida', 'John', 'Singleton', 'truly', 'definitive', 'film', 'When', 'given', 'tools', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'something', 'awful', 'not', 'Roots', 'why', 'go', 'back', 'film', 'school', 'learn', 'roots', 'filmmaking']",N/A

All this happens because a white woman falsely accused a black man of raping her.Truly a horrific tale, all the more so because it happened, although an accurate death count has never been determined.  This sad account went unknown for many years due to a cover up as well as resident's refusal to talk abou the events.  Director John Singleton probably takes a worst case scenario view of the body count and pure horror with burning bodies being hung by the neck and other such gruesome crimes.Caught up in this chaotic story is Ving Rhames playing Mann, a former soldier who was merely passing through town and ends up having to fight for his life as well as heroically saving a number of children from the marauding racists.  Don Cheadle gives an outstanding performance as a Rosewood resident who proves smarter than the rednecks.Jon Voight plays a local business owner who is sympathetic to the blacks and for that is labeld a ""_____"" lover by the other whites.  But Voight doesn't care and actually provides a safe harbor to several blacks after the attack begins.Michael Rooker, who also played in Mississippi Burning gives a fine performance as sheriff Walker who while racist himself, finally realizes that the accusations were false but by then is unable to stop the mayhem.  Bruce McGill is the typical, fat, white redneck as Duke Purdy.The film is beautifully shot and John Jenson deserves a big tip of the hat for his cinematography as he captured the small-town, ramshackle look of 1920's Florida that greatly lent to the film's look of authenticity.

And John Voight are excellent.,4,good movie,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,196,"['One', 'better', 'movies', 'Ving', 'Thames', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'think', 'told', 'well', 'Also', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'John', 'Voight', 'are', 'excellent']",N/A

I noticed her mistake when I got home, but after watching this film I was  only glad that she made that mistake and pulled this movie from a drawer,  where it was stuck. It was not put on the shelves, I must say.... One of  the reviewers already gave brief synopsis, so I'll just add that I cried  throughout most of the film. I felt angry, sad and heavy with grief, but I  forced myself to watch it, no matter how much pain or shame I felt. I am  neither white american nor black, but the pain and the shame I felt are  universal emoitons.... two emotions all people should feel, after watching  this film...in this case these emotions are about humongous injustice that  passed unnoticed for so long...  Apart from a lesson to be learnt, this  film  also works well on all cinematic levels: story is told well, actors  are good, etc. Very powerful!",5,"Must-See,no matter how painful or shameful it makes you feel",957916800,"05 10, 2000",2000,990,"['fantastic', 'movie', 'knew', 'nothing', 'clerk', 'rental', 'accidently', 'gave', 'instead', 'movie', 'wanted', 'rent', 'noticed', 'mistake', 'when', 'got', 'home', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'glad', 'made', 'mistake', 'pulled', 'movie', 'drawer', 'where', 'was', 'stuck', 'was', 'not', 'put', 'shelves', 'must', 'say', 'One', 'reviewers', 'already', 'gave', 'brief', 'synopsis', ""'ll"", 'just', 'add', 'cried', 'most', 'film', 'felt', 'angry', 'sad', 'heavy', 'grief', 'forced', 'watch', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'pain', 'shame', 'felt', 'am', 'neither', 'white', 'american', 'black', 'pain', 'shame', 'felt', 'are', 'universal', 'emoitons', 'two', 'emotions', 'people', 'should', 'feel', 'watching', 'film', 'case', 'emotions', 'are', 'humongous', 'injustice', 'passed', 'unnoticed', 'so', 'long', 'Apart', 'lesson', 'be', 'learnt', 'film', 'also', 'well', 'cinematic', 'levels', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'etc', 'Very', 'powerful']",N/A
