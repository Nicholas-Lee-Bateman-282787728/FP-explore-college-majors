The story is familiar; we have known since our earliest days the story of Captain John Smith and his people's pilgrimage to the new world.  But the presentation in this film shakes the dust off our familiarity.  The camera shots and acting are expert for making us feel like we, too, are on that same journey with all its awe and innocense.  Refreshingly, the portrayal of natives and pilgrims is not clearly drawn as just heroes and villains for either side.  The natives presented bring an emotional spark that the history books and our own imaginations somehow lacked.  Then because of an unfortunate state of events, we are also presented with a romantic triangle with its fateful and beautiful consequences.  The realities of hardship as well as the spirit of freedom are underscored admirably throughout the film.If ""all is fair in love and war,"" then this may be the fairest movie of them all.  The chemistry between John Smith (Colin Farrell) and Pocahantas, surnamed Rebecca, (Q'orianka Kilcher) is marvelous, and the beautiful cinematography is certainly alluring.  The music too, with its simple orchestration, highlights events with primitive crescendos and nice nuances.  The way the settlers and the Native Americans are portrayed is absorbing enough to keep our interest.  Nevertheless, this movie may be of personal taste.  For what it is, it is excellent, but for some it may be a transcending voyage, for others it may only induce a nap.",5,Beautiful and Brave 'New World',1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,1517,"[""'The"", 'New', 'World', 'viewer', 'laguorous', 'grandeur', 'story', 'familiar', 'have', 'known', 'earliest', 'days', 'story', 'Captain', 'John', 'Smith', 'people', 'pilgrimage', 'new', 'world', 'presentation', 'film', 'dust', 'familiarity', 'camera', 'shots', 'acting', 'are', 'expert', 'making', 'feel', 'too', 'are', 'same', 'journey', 'awe', 'innocense', 'Refreshingly', 'portrayal', 'natives', 'pilgrims', 'not', 'clearly', 'drawn', 'just', 'heroes', 'villains', 'side', 'natives', 'presented', 'bring', 'emotional', 'spark', 'history', 'books', 'own', 'imaginations', 'somehow', 'lacked', 'Then', 'unfortunate', 'state', 'events', 'are', 'also', 'presented', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'fateful', 'beautiful', 'consequences', 'realities', 'hardship', 'as', 'well', 'spirit', 'freedom', 'are', 'underscored', 'admirably', 'film.If', 'fair', 'love', 'war', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'fairest', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'John', 'Smith', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Pocahantas', 'surnamed', 'Rebecca', ""Q'orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'marvelous', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'certainly', 'alluring', 'music', 'too', 'simple', 'orchestration', 'highlights', 'events', 'primitive', 'crescendos', 'nice', 'nuances', 'way', 'settlers', 'Native', 'Americans', 'are', 'portrayed', 'absorbing', 'enough', 'keep', 'interest', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'personal', 'taste', 'what', 'excellent', 'may', 'be', 'transcending', 'voyage', 'others', 'may', 'only', 'induce', 'nap']",N/A

975283,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000EOTTTU,A Customer,"[6, 10]","When the native Algonquin tribe looks out over their unspoiled Eden and sees two British navel ships, their reaction is a mixture of interest and astonishment. Who are these strange men who have landed on their shore, with their white faces, lank hair and strange smells? Yet their thunderstruck reaction to the Englishmen who are slowly infiltrating their land is laced with concern that has yet to blossom into worry.The English convey that lands in Virginia in 1607 - scored to a gorgeously striking flourish of horns - will spell doom for the native Indians; and over time their way of life, their culture will gradually disintegrate. The Jamestown colonists, led by Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) eventually lands his men, intent for them to eke out a life in this strange and lush world.For Jamestown - named after King James 1 - will be the new, enlightened, and egalitarian society, free from the suffocating social strictures of merry old England. When Newport promptly vanishes back to England for reinforcements, the settlement's security is placed in the hands of the formerly disgraced Captain John Smith (a very good Colin Farrell).However, things aren't going well for this fledgling colony - the landscape proves to be harsh, food becomes scarce, with these inexperienced European outcasts beginning to wonder of they will ever be able to survive in this alien world. In search of food, Smith leads an expedition up the Chickahominy River, but along the way when a Powhatan tribe attacks his group and he is taken prisoner.Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg) is prepared for slaughter Smith, but at the last minute Pocahontas  (Q'orianka Kilcher), intervenes and his life is spared. Powhatan agrees to let him remain and teach the princess his language, hoping that her friendship with the Captain will tell him of the visitors' intentions.But as Smith familiarizes himself with the ways of the tribe he considers the possibility of staying on to live among them. He's fallen in love with the princess, who passionately requites his feelings and he sees in their civilization - a lack of greed, vice and cynicism, a new way of being that is lacking in his own.The New World is a gorgeously evocative, sad, heart wrenching and bittersweet movie, with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki capturing the epic grandeur and luminosity of the 1607 Virginia landscape in all its sensual glory. Terrance Malick's direction is languid and fluid - there's not a scene, or a camera angle wasted, as he allows this incredible cinematic experience to gradually unfurl.Watching this beautiful movie unfold conveys the strangeness and magnitude of human history, the weight of human endurance and the power of compassion and love. As Pocahontas is betrayed by her tribe, banished by her father and sold to the settlers as insurance - the slow transformation of her into a corseted and heeled Englishwoman, where she says good-bye to her native roots - is at once tragic and profound.When she eventually meets tobacco farmer John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and he asks her to marry him, we know that the transformation of the princess is complete. Although she does not immediately love him, the scenes between them are tentative and caring. The acting is superlative with Farrell, Bale and Kilcher making the most out of their mostly non-verbal roles, providing essential voice-overs as the action progresses.The New World is a languid and lovely dreamscape, a movie of symphonic proportions, a work of breathtaking imagination, and an all-embracing cinematic tone poem. And the use of Mozart's 23d Piano Concerto alerts us to the fact that this is European dream, even John Smith's dream; it's also the dream of a utopian ""new world,"" and where the hopes of a new beginning are dashed, where perhaps victory can only come in the form of a splendid and divine savagery.

975284,A15G57AIKJ5PRQ,B000EOTTTU,"A. C. Walter ""awalter""","[10, 16]","Great, sweeping, lyrical shots of the natural world. A passionate but respectful infatuation between the camera's eye and the lovely face of a young beauty we've never seen before. Ever-climbing, harmonious waves of symphonic delicacy. And a powerful, labyrinthine mood built of images that court the eye rather than assail it. These are just a few of the pleasures offered by ""The New World.""Something to realize, right from the start, about Terrance Malick's new film is that he's telling his story on an abstracted plane and by way of the mythological mode. If just hearing that gives you a headache, then maybe this isn't the movie for you. Otherwise, you're in for a real treat.Okay, okay... So maybe Pocahontas was a mere ten years old when she saw her first white people and only twelve when John Smith left her and the Jamestown settlement in 1609. Maybe there was no enigmatic, and potentially romantic, relationship between the two. But this is all beside the point. Malick is not interested--and we can be ever so thankful for this--in telling a polemically-oriented story. He's not interested in giving us a dry, by-the-numbers, cinematic regurgitation of fact, or in constructing some historical-revisionist fantasy.It should be obvious, for anyone paying attention to Malick's unusual filming style here, that this Pocahontas (played by the 14-year-old Q'Orianka Kilcher) is the archetype that has grown out of her legend. Here she is woman-as-land, a rather obvious but effective metaphor. Malick builds onto the metaphor two love stories, each taking as its object this blend of woman and land. The first romance (with explorer John Smith--Colin Farrell) is one of innocence, at least on the part of Pocahontas. The second (with farmer John Rolfe--Christian Bale), by far the more difficult relationship, is a romance of experience. These romances, of course, are what make great myth and great cinema. And like all great legends, this one presents a larger-than-life story yet leaves us to draw our own conclusions from it. But that's art for you--something with which most movies shouldn't be confused.And how refreshing it is to see a film built from elliptical, intuitive patterns of imagery and soliloquy rather than from a dogged plot or ideologically-motivated pandering. The New World--like Martin Scorsese's ""Kundun"" or Peter Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock""--is that rare thing, a dream you can sink into, a place to momentarily lose yourself in visual and aural poetry.",5,the strange & wonderful art of Terrance Malick,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,2495,"['Great', 'sweeping', 'lyrical', 'shots', 'natural', 'world', 'passionate', 'respectful', 'infatuation', 'camera', 'eye', 'lovely', 'face', 'young', 'beauty', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Ever-climbing', 'harmonious', 'waves', 'symphonic', 'delicacy', 'powerful', 'labyrinthine', 'mood', 'built', 'images', 'court', 'eye', 'rather', 'assail', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'pleasures', 'offered', 'New', 'World', 'Something', 'realize', 'right', 'start', 'about', 'Terrance', 'Malick', 'new', 'film', 'telling', 'story', 'abstracted', 'plane', 'way', 'mythological', 'mode', 'just', 'hearing', 'headache', 'then', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Otherwise', ""'re"", 'real', 'treat.Okay', 'okay', 'So', 'maybe', 'Pocahontas', 'was', 'mere', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'white', 'people', 'only', 'twelve', 'when', 'John', 'Smith', 'left', 'Jamestown', 'settlement', '1609', 'Maybe', 'was', 'enigmatic', 'potentially', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'two', 'point', 'Malick', 'not', 'interested', 'can', 'be', 'ever', 'so', 'thankful', 'telling', 'polemically-oriented', 'story', 'not', 'interested', 'giving', 'dry', 'by-the-numbers', 'cinematic', 'regurgitation', 'fact', 'constructing', 'historical-revisionist', 'fantasy.It', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'paying', 'attention', 'Malick', 'unusual', 'filming', 'style', 'here', 'Pocahontas', 'played', '14-year-old', ""Q'Orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'archetype', 'grown', 'legend', 'Here', 'woman-as-land', 'rather', 'obvious', 'effective', 'metaphor', 'Malick', 'metaphor', 'two', 'love', 'stories', 'taking', 'object', 'blend', 'woman', 'land', 'first', 'romance', 'explorer', 'John', 'Smith', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'one', 'innocence', 'least', 'part', 'Pocahontas', 'second', 'farmer', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'far', 'more', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'romance', 'experience', 'romances', 'course', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'great', 'myth', 'great', 'cinema', 'great', 'legends', 'one', 'larger-than-life', 'story', 'yet', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'art', 'something', 'most', 'movies', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'confused.And', 'how', 'refreshing', 'see', 'film', 'built', 'elliptical', 'intuitive', 'patterns', 'imagery', 'soliloquy', 'rather', 'dogged', 'plot', 'ideologically-motivated', 'pandering', 'New', 'World', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Kundun', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Picnic', 'Hanging', 'Rock', 'rare', 'thing', 'dream', 'can', 'sink', 'place', 'momentarily', 'lose', 'visual', 'aural', 'poetry']",N/A
975285,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,B000EOTTTU,Alric the Red,"[9, 12]","Based on the naysayers who described this film as almost grueling, I delayed seeing it, waiting for the steeled moment when I could endure it.  Most of the people who hated it complained that it was too slow, redundant with scenery.  Some were so sure of their own disdain that they accused as poseurs those who claim to like it, as phonies wanting to maintain credentials among the arthouse crowd.  Well, I saw it last night, and my objectively subjective opinion is that it was truly a magnificent film.First, let's talk about all that wonderful photography.  This is true.  It was indeed some beautiful stuff: lush fields, trees reaching to heaven from the floor of earth, verdant riverbanks, vast skies reflected in glassy water, on and on.  However, this was NOT the cinematic equivalent of a coffee-table book.  The cinematography was very much part of that story, inseparable from it.  It was a meditation on nature and humankind's part in it, as organisms existing within its indifference, merely part of its design and fulfillment for its own mysterious purpose.  Events are felt and recorded individually, as pain or joy, but the wider reality is that it's impersonal.  For Terrence Malick's point, this was the only way this movie could have been filmed.  I found it constantly engaging, and I assimilated both the cinematography and story as a holistic experience.And it was quite a story.  Malick reached for accuracy in depicting the hardscrabble the early colonists faced.  The Europeans seemed to be people not at peace with nature directly, and, unwilling or unable to adapt to its demands, became mired in filth and disease, the result of hubris.  The infighting arising from desperation and misery was almost surreal in that the film never dallied at any point, never belabored it for dramatic effect.  The story merely unfolded, the camera just an eye witnessing it and framing it in this gorgeous arbor, edited to reflect seamlessness from one event to the other.  This had the affect of rendering all events evenly, one not more important than the other.  Everything is eventually dissolved in the landscape, becoming just another aspect of nature.  Even the conflict that arose between Europeans and ""the naturals"" is absorbed without any condemnation, as natural to the earth as the corn growing. It was a spiritual theme without the warm fuzzies, all human beings at bottom adrift without some transcendent guidance.  The spiritual theme was embodied in Pocahontas herself, adapting to the realities, comprehending love as a consolation prize.At no time in this film was Pocahontas mentioned by name.  Neither was the tribe from which she came.  Again Malick seems to present human beings as anonymous catalysts under the vaulted skies.  Also, the sound deserves more than a passing nod.  Malick applied the same amount of meticulous detail to the aural experience as he did the visual one. Even the credits were a pleasure to sit through as the sounds of a beguiling wilderness surround you.  It was really a fine piece of work, a modern masterpiece.The DVD has a 55-minute feature describing how it all came together.  I loved this movie so much, I watched that feature immediately.  Malick tried his very best to be authentic to the story, with consultants and historians and real natives all pitching in.  There's also a lot of good stuff about how Malick works on the set, which is quite eye-opening.A friend of mine who saw A THIN RED LINE (another Malick film) told me he hated it.  Going by his word and my own disdain for war movies, I was never tempted to see it.  Other people levied against it the same sort of complaints I've heard for THE NEW WORLD.  After last night, I'm going to have to see A THIN RED LINE for myself.

975286,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,B000EOTTTU,Amazon Customer,"[13, 18]","I give this film two stars for the visual beauty of the film, and for what was probably a reasonably accurate portrayal of the hardships faced by the Jamestown settlers, and the mixture of curiosity, fear, and misunderstanding that came out of the initial meeting between the English colonists, and the native Algonquians they encountered.I have to say, however, that I was let down by the rest of the film, and it's not by the historical inaccuracy either. Though I prefer historical accuracy in historical films, I am willing to make some allowances. True, Matoaka (Pocahontas' real name) was a mere ten to twelve years old when she met John Smith, and most historians doubt there ever was a romance between the two. True, also, that the act of Pocahontas throwing herself across Smith's prostrate form an instant before he was about to have his brains beaten out may, according to some historians, may have been an entirely ceremonial act, with Smith not in any real danger. It also may never have occurred at all, since Smith didn't write it down until a decade later (and only on his second telling of the story). But the story of Pocahontas' instant attraction for Smith, and the romance of these two characters has, like the legends of Robin Hood, entered into folklore and popular culture, and taken on a life of its own, so it's probably impossible to tell this story without that in it. No, that's not what bothers me.Put simply, this film is dull, plodding, and seemingly endless. Less than halfway through, I started looking at my watch. Living not too far from the site of the Jamestown settlement, and having a keen interest in history, I was thrilled when I heard this film was in production. I became anxious, however, upon reading that Terrence Malick was directing. This was the same man who brought us a war movie long on scenes of brooding introspection and waving grass, and notably short on action. He did precisely the same here, and the effect is precisely the same -- a long, boring, motionless picture. No matter how visually stunning a movie is, I just can't get behind it when it moves this slowly.  And the reviewers I see here praising the film to the skies frankly mystify me.  This movie is visually superb, as I said, but in other respects, it is simply *not* a well made movie.  I'm sorry, but it's not.  It almost totally lacks exposition (and what little there is has to be provided by voice over narration, because the character dialogue is so sparse it can't get the job done), the story is vague and unfocused, the narrative is muddled and lacks cohesion, and the characters are lifeless and stiff.  But there seems to be a type of person - a rather pretentious type, I regret I must say - who seems to take anything that a majority of people consider incomprehensible, baffling, or even just plain dull, and treats it as evidence of artistic genius.  One review I read when the movie was first released had this to say: ""The movie is frustrating, mainly because of Malick's penchant for emphasizing style over substance.

975287,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000EOTTTU,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[12, 30]","I decided to chance it one day and go see ""The New World"" because it had one of my most respected actors in it (Colin Farrel and Christopher Plummer) and it looked quite good, since there were very few realistic colonial-era movies of the subject.What I saw in the theater was not a film.It felt like a pretentious art student's college film trying so hard to be blas&eacute; and chic and all those fancy crazy words with obscure meanings that scream ""creative"" and fumbles like a giant tumbling off a cliff.First off, the sparse dialogue. There's hardly much dialogue in any scene minus a few lines spoken by a character off-camera or for a few shots on camera. If all the dialogue were put together and single-spaced, it'd take up at most five pages of the script. The sparse dialogue isn't even memorable or deeply moving! It's just blandly stating the obvious like ""we're here in the new world."" ""the natives are savages"" ""it's been three days."" So where does most of the movie go if there's virtually no dialogue? Cinematography. I rate this one star only because it looked authentic. The vast majority of the camera and film was devoted to cinematography and just filming trees and grass swaying in the wind and birds and indians frolicking like playful little things.The young new actress playing Pocahantas (who isn't even named in the film, we just assume she's Pocahantas) is really uneventful and unfulfilling, and a bore to look at (and her upper lip is humongous compared to her lower lip). At least Colin Farrel tries hard in his role, whereas Christopher Plummer doesn't look too anxious and seems glad to be rid of himself by the middle of the movie.The latter half takes place in England, where Pocahantas ends up with another colonist. It's equally silent there dialogue-wise, and very uneventful save for a silent meeting with the King and Queen and a frolic through the vast maze gardens of the palace's backyard.So in total, the movie consisted of Pocahantas frolicking, and some scenes with the white men and indians looking concerned and the occasional spoken word or gunfire. But mostly frolicking.Additions: This was the first movie where I lifted up the armrest of my theater chair, laid on my side, and nodded off several times, almost falling asleep.  Not because it's lacking gunfire and loud noises and typical ""Americans only like car chases and shootouts and sex"", but because it's simply BORING and totally sparse.  Hardly any music, hardly any sound, hardly any ANYTHING save moving pictures of people.My only relief comes in seeing that other people have rated this movie 1 star.

I didn't heed the reviews here on Amazon, and less than 1 minute into the film I knew there was trouble ahead when the score music for the Jamestown landing is Wagner's Rheinmaiden frolic from ""Das Rheningold."" What on Earth!? Then there is the other main music theme playing periodically throughout the film: a Glinka-esque piano. The bulk of dialogue is rambling, monologue voice over narration, principally Collin Farrell's obnoxious, whispery accented voice rambling philosophical. Honestly, these monologues sound like bad coffee shop poetry reading night entries. And the melancholy, faux highbrow tone -- all I could think of were the annoying narrator and companion in ""Russian Ark.""The nature and native sequences are interesting - but with the riddiculous soundtrack I kept having images of the three Rhein nymphs swimming with the Nibelung troll. Then Glinka's piano would start playing (late 19th century romantic themes), and the image switches to sipping tea from a samovar in a Winter Palace salon.Oh, and the opening sequence with the map is a blatant rip-off of ""Blackrobe.""So much potential ... blown",1,"Wierd mix of ""Blackrobe"" and ""Russian Ark""",1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,1200,"['Well', 'junkie', 'historical', 'films', 'finally', 'had', 'break', 'down', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'heed', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'less', '1', 'minute', 'film', 'knew', 'was', 'trouble', 'ahead', 'when', 'score', 'music', 'Jamestown', 'landing', 'Wagner', 'Rheinmaiden', 'frolic', 'Das', 'Rheningold', 'What', 'Earth', 'Then', 'other', 'main', 'music', 'theme', 'playing', 'periodically', 'film', 'Glinka-esque', 'piano', 'bulk', 'dialogue', 'rambling', 'monologue', 'voice', 'narration', 'principally', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'obnoxious', 'whispery', 'accented', 'voice', 'rambling', 'philosophical', 'Honestly', 'monologues', 'sound', 'bad', 'coffee', 'shop', 'poetry', 'reading', 'night', 'entries', 'melancholy', 'faux', 'highbrow', 'tone', 'could', 'think', 'were', 'annoying', 'narrator', 'companion', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'nature', 'native', 'sequences', 'are', 'interesting', 'riddiculous', 'soundtrack', 'kept', 'having', 'images', 'three', 'Rhein', 'nymphs', 'swimming', 'Nibelung', 'troll', 'Then', 'Glinka', 'piano', 'would', 'start', 'playing', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'romantic', 'themes', 'image', 'sipping', 'tea', 'samovar', 'Winter', 'Palace', 'salon.Oh', 'opening', 'sequence', 'map', 'blatant', 'rip-off', 'Blackrobe', 'So', 'much', 'potential', 'blown']",N/A

975290,ARA48345JZPZR,B000EOTTTU,Archmaker,"[4, 6]","By now anyone going to a Terrence Mallick film should know what he is going to get: gorgeous cinematography of the landscape and environment, interesting production details, minimal dialogue,  voice-over narration of a poetic and philosophical bent, and exhaltation of nature and a mourning for the loss of innocence.  All are present here in abundance, and your appreciation of the film will depend greatly on your acceptance and enjoyment of his technique and themes, or not.Frankly, I waver back and forth on Mallick's film-making style.  I argued vociferously with friends over the merits of The Thin Red Line.  And yet, I could understand their impatience with the intermitten ""poetic"" fancies.  And there is a certain underlying naivete to his views of nature being paradisical and the notion of the ""noble savage"" the pure innocence of ""primitive"" man in nature that sometime smacks of Philosophy 101.  Likewise, his romanticism and poetic flights can be simplistic and mythic.But I always find his films interesting and beautiful to watch.  He is usually greatly helped by the fine actors that always want to work with him, and never more so than here with Christopher Plummer, Colin Farrell and Christian Bale.  And a master-stroke of casting and good luck was his find of the young Q'orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas, who is the heart and soul of the film.  She is graceful, lovely and simply luminous, and makes the story of her life and the men who loved her absolutely believable.Amidst his romanticism, Mallick has always been able to find the harsh realities as well.  The spree killings in Badlands, the  betrayal and murder in Days of Heaven , combat in The Thin Red Line.  Here it is the harshness and disintegration of Jamestown, depicted vividly and memorably.Also, whatever I thought I knew about the Pocahontas story was sadly lacking, and I found much information here, if correct, with which I was unfamiliar.  And it is a fascinating story.So, this is a film that will not appeal to a broad audience.  Mallick's technique is a real turn-off to many viewers.  Even though I admire much of the film, at times I get impatient with it as well.  I find, for me, the incredible sense of ""this is what it must have been like"" to encounter this ""New World"" of pristine forest and river and marsh worth indulging the rest.  ""This is the forest primeval"" indeed, and the people and land have never been depicted more forcefully.  It envelops you.Finally, there is a love story (or actually two) told here that, in the end, is worth seeing.  So, my recommendation is for those with the patience to let a film unfold in its own way, and for those not off-put by fragmented, sometimes enigmatic, voice-over musings as narration.

The tribes lived as they had for millennia, hunting, gathering and honoring the surrounding natural world. They knew nothing of deception, greed, property or bureaucracy, the ills of ""civilization"". Then one day the great ships came...This is not a standard, play-by-play historical learning tool by any means. The New World looks at these events as if through a dream.  It is all about beauty, wonder and emotion. Not only was the cinematography perfect, but it captured  America's virgin wilderness just as I imagine it must have appeared to the newcomers back then - and in a way that few Americans even today will ever see it. The connection made between John Smith and Pocahontas unfolds slowly, alive and tangible in a way that few other films have managed. I am not normally a romantic, but I fell hard as I watched.The musical score is a hand in hand companion here, building wonder and intensity; this would not have been the same film without it. It haunted me for days.  Between the music and the landscapes a tangible presence was effectively created.  Without the influence of any of the usual, manipulative tricks that directors sometimes employ to symbolize the Divine, my spirit was worshipping God. Glorious!For the actors' part, The New World boasts a great ensemble of quality performers, both familiar and new. Christopher Plummer is of course superb as the captain and overseer of the mission; but Colin Ferrell and Christian Bale went far beyond their usual typecastings as pretty boy action heroes, delivering instead thoughtful and tender portraits of the men who fell in love with Pocahontas. And what can we say about our leading lady, Q'orianka Kilcher, except that she gave this story its heart?  Ms. Kilcher is a fabulous new find, one that I sincerely hope will go far in the film industry as a very nontraditional beauty with genuine talent.You may have seen the animated versions of the Pocahontas story; forget all that. The New World takes this piece of history and elevates it to the level of true art. Was it exactly accurate? I don't know, I'm not enough of a history scholar to say.

First off, the dialog of both the characters and even more so, the narrating was mostly unintelligible.  Nearly everything was said in such hushed whispers mixed with accents and mumbling, that we had to turn up the volume and play some scenes over to try to understand what was said to no avail.  Three little kids that were in a couple scenes were babbling so badly we could not understand even one word and wondered if they were even speaking english, we still are not sure.  Still unable to understand what was being said after watching some scenes over and over, we eventually gave up and just tryed to follow what was going on visually ignoring the incoherent speach.  Even though it was supposed to be in english, subtitles would have been very helpful.

If you have watched The Thin Red Line you will know what I mean. He is content to do the slow simmer than blast away with a blow torch. And if you think about it, human emotions are also pretty much the same. They usually simmer away within us and at times blow up too :)The movie's star performer is undoubtedly Q'orianka Kilcher (With such a cool name how can you not be a star, ay?). She effortlessly portrays the transition of Pocahontas (Interestingly the movie never mentions her name) from a young girl smitten in love with Captain Smith (played by Colin Farrell) to the lovely lady who arrives on the British Shores and charms the King and Queen.But ultimately the movie belongs to Terrence Mallik. The delicateness and tact with which he handles the entire story is mesmerising. The dialogue in the movie is sparse. And that only serves to enhance the experience. Almost gives one the sense that Mallik has taken a scalpel to the screenplay.The cinematography is simply outstanding. The shots which intermingle with Smith's narrative are so breathtaking and downright poetic.""The New World"" is ultimately a discovery for all involved - Smith & Co discovered their New World on the shores of US, Pocahontas discovers a new world among the settlers and later in Britain and we discover the sumptuousness of a movie which does not hurry through the details but instead lets us take in every ounce of artistic flair that it has to offer.",4,Slow braised tenderness,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,1937,"['saw', 'movie', 'DVD', 'have', 'feeling', 'beautiful', 'Virginia', 'landscapes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'larger', 'screen.When', 'say', 'long', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'cutting', 'corners', 'running', 'time', '150', 'mins', 'can', 'see', 'lot', 'going', 'Whoah', 'Trust', 'was', 'not', 'difficult', 'Think', 'lovely', 'slow', 'cooked', 'meal', 'impossible', 'achieve', 'kind', 'tenderness', 'flavor', 'fast', 'food', 'approach.In', 'fact', 'exactly', 'directorial', 'style', 'Terrence', 'Mallik', 'have', 'watched', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'content', 'do', 'slow', 'simmer', 'blast', 'away', 'blow', 'torch', 'think', 'human', 'emotions', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'usually', 'simmer', 'away', 'times', 'blow', 'up', 'too', 'movie', 'star', 'performer', 'undoubtedly', ""Q'orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'cool', 'name', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'star', 'ay', 'effortlessly', 'transition', 'Pocahontas', 'Interestingly', 'movie', 'never', 'name', 'young', 'girl', 'smitten', 'love', 'Captain', 'Smith', 'played', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'lovely', 'lady', 'who', 'British', 'Shores', 'King', 'Queen.But', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'Terrence', 'Mallik', 'delicateness', 'tact', 'entire', 'story', 'mesmerising', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'sparse', 'only', 'enhance', 'experience', 'one', 'sense', 'Mallik', 'taken', 'scalpel', 'screenplay.The', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'shots', 'intermingle', 'Smith', 'narrative', 'are', 'so', 'breathtaking', 'downright', 'poetic', 'New', 'World', 'ultimately', 'discovery', 'involved', 'Smith', 'Co', 'discovered', 'New', 'World', 'shores', 'US', 'Pocahontas', 'new', 'world', 'settlers', 'later', 'Britain', 'discover', 'sumptuousness', 'movie', 'not', 'hurry', 'details', 'instead', 'take', 'ounce', 'artistic', 'flair', 'offer']",N/A

But boy was I happy that I did see it. There are truly no better words to describe it then captivating: from minute one the audience is drawn into Pocahontas' surreal tribal world where the opening sequence plays out in the form of a choreographed dance piece more than anything else. The Natives, which I was happy to hear pitched in during production while watching the features, are restored to their original glory in ecclectic customes one wouldn't normally associate with Pocahontas' tribe (which is, to the best of anybody's knowledge, is how they dressed). Colin Farrel takes on the form of John Smith (who is actually described as shorter than Pocahontas in real life) in this shockingly well-done performence. Pocahontas is revived by the talented newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher, who plays the princess to the best of anybody's knowledge and does justice to her character's name, which means just that: playful, frolicsome little girl.The romance is set in the back drop along the coast of Virginia, and what a beautiful cinematography this is (which, unless I am mistaken, was nominated for an oscar), with sweeping and epic shots of the scenary - which is my only complaint of this entire movie. Director Terry Malick must have been in love with the setting, with a majority of the film just long shots of nature - at times, I found it repetitive. A point was made by the end of the film but at times I couldn't help but feel as if he was trying to jam in as much nature shots as humanly possible.Then there is the lost story of John Rolfe, whom I am extremly happy is put to place in this movie. He is played elegantly by Christian Bale, who has most likely done his research on this religious and reserved man. I was very happy to see John Rolfe portrayed as respectfully (as one will note towards the end of the film, especially during Pocahontas' demise) as Bale portrayed him.All in all, this is a very captivating movie. I was truly moved by it, especially in the last five minutes of the film which is truly haunting. A movie not for everybody, however - anybody that is interested in the life (or to the best of our knowledge, of course some of this film is fabricated) of Pocahontas should watch this movie.",5,"Haunting, Captivating...Truly Historic",1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,2520,"['someone', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'past', 'doing', 'intense', 'research', 'life', 'Pocahontas', 'most', 'part', 'overshadowed', 'questionable', 'love', 'affair', 'John', 'Smith', 'shady', 'best', 'was', 'first', 'hesitant', 'give', 'movie', 'shot', 'given', 'Disney', 'Pocahontas', 'boy', 'was', 'happy', 'did', 'see', 'are', 'truly', 'better', 'words', 'describe', 'then', 'captivating', 'minute', 'one', 'audience', 'drawn', 'Pocahontas', 'surreal', 'tribal', 'world', 'where', 'opening', 'sequence', 'out', 'form', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'piece', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Natives', 'was', 'happy', 'hear', 'pitched', 'production', 'watching', 'features', 'are', 'restored', 'original', 'glory', 'ecclectic', 'customes', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'normally', 'associate', 'Pocahontas', 'tribe', 'best', 'anybody', 'knowledge', 'how', 'dressed', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'form', 'John', 'Smith', 'who', 'actually', 'described', 'shorter', 'Pocahontas', 'real', 'life', 'shockingly', 'well-done', 'performence', 'Pocahontas', 'revived', 'talented', 'newcomer', ""Q'Orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'who', 'princess', 'best', 'anybody', 'knowledge', 'justice', 'character', 'name', 'just', 'playful', 'frolicsome', 'little', 'girl.The', 'romance', 'set', 'back', 'drop', 'coast', 'Virginia', 'what', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'am', 'mistaken', 'was', 'nominated', 'oscar', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'shots', 'scenary', 'only', 'complaint', 'entire', 'movie', 'Director', 'Terry', 'Malick', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'love', 'setting', 'majority', 'film', 'just', 'long', 'shots', 'nature', 'times', 'found', 'repetitive', 'point', 'was', 'made', 'end', 'film', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'was', 'trying', 'jam', 'as', 'much', 'nature', 'shots', 'humanly', 'lost', 'story', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'whom', 'am', 'extremly', 'happy', 'put', 'place', 'movie', 'played', 'elegantly', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'most', 'likely', 'done', 'research', 'religious', 'reserved', 'man', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'see', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'portrayed', 'respectfully', 'one', 'will', 'note', 'end', 'film', 'especially', 'Pocahontas', 'demise', 'Bale', 'portrayed', 'him.All', 'very', 'captivating', 'movie', 'was', 'truly', 'moved', 'especially', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'truly', 'haunting', 'movie', 'not', 'everybody', 'however', 'anybody', 'interested', 'life', 'best', 'knowledge', 'course', 'film', 'fabricated', 'Pocahontas', 'should', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

The critics hammered it to pieces in gigantic efforts to show they knew better.  But the public went to see it and went again.  Still here today, still loved after 46 years, after a terrible start, that film still sells in blu-ray.Well, maybe that's the case for this movie.  Maybe not.  Time will tell.Certainly it is not a common well known story.  The extended version is what I bought.  The story of Jamestown itself is far more complex than shown is this movie.The story of Pocahontas is also far more complex than shown in this movie.The feature on the making of the movie is a marvel for me.

He started in 1967.According to Wikipedia, the film wasn't a block buster costing thirty million to make and box office intake of $30,536,013.

975299,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000EOTTTU,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 7]","The New World has many detractors. Most comment on the slow pace of the film, and this is undeniably so. ""It's like watching grass grow"" is the commonly heard clich&eacute;. I'm not here to defend the speed at which this story unfolds; it IS slow. But it's also beautifully put together.Try this: You're in a raft on a placidly flowing river. Trees wash by, animals nibble grasses on the shores, the sky illuminates a beautiful blue above and below while the sun warms your legs. The rapids are few and easily navigated, allowing you time to view everything around you. Sound boring? Or comfortable?If this sounds like death, stay away from The New World. If it sounds pleasant and enjoyable, give the film a try.What I enjoyed was the how the story dribbled into the viewer's lap. It roiled around you like a cool mountain stream and allowed time for everything to come into focus. This isn't Disney's Pocahontas; this is how the Jamestown Settlement came to be, in all its boringness and beauty.Colin Farrell stars as Captain John Smith, one of the founders of the original colonies. He and his shipmates arrive in the Americas and are soon building a fort while the leader of the group, Captain Christopher Newport (Christopher Plummer), heads back to Europe to resupply and bring more colonists.Meanwhile, Jamestown is nearly overrun by disease, power struggles, and the native Indians. Amidst all this, Captain Smith meets up with Pocahontas, the pretty and inquisitive daughter of a local chieftain. It is her generosity that allows these first colonists to survive, and it is mainly because of her love for Smith.After Captain Smith leaves the colony in search of better lands up north, it is wrongly reported to Pocahontas that her love perished in a shipping accident. Thus she despairs and eventually falls for John Rolfe (Christian Bale), a tobacco farmer.Pocahontas is later requested by the King and Queen of England to come to Court and meet them ...and she does. Thus, we have TWO new worlds being discovered: one for the Europeans (America), and one for the Native Americans (England and Europe).Pocahontas later learns that Captain Smith is still alive. It is a bitter realization and she has to decide whom to stay with, Smith or Rolfe.It is the beautiful cinematography of The New World that really pulls the viewer in. Some have complained that it should have won Best Cinematography at the Oscars and not Memoirs of a Geisha. I disagree. The New World is extremely beautiful to watch, no doubt, but I feel Memoirs of a Geisha was a bit better on the eyes.The wondrous musical score was another boon for the film. Surrounding the viewer/listener in an emulsion of color and sound, the music made for some powerful moments. Terrence Malick, Director, knows how to engage an audience. But it's not going to capture all those who watch it.In a society where action sells better than art, this film will be lost to many. Don't get me wrong, I love action films just as much as anyone. But it's not a necessary ingredient for a movie such as this. The authenticity (as seen on the DVD's extra features) will astound many; I know it blew me away. The re-creation of the settlement, the Native American huts, the battle gear, etc, are all pulled from archaeological records and sources. Impressive.It's also noteworthy to mention how little dialogue there is in the film. Terrence Malick prefers to let the scenes speak for themselves rather than have actors and actresses voices spoil the moment.I guess what it boils down to is this: If you don't like art films that focus on nuance rather than specifics, stay away from The New World. But if you don't mind letting your mind meander through a burbling set of scenes, you'll probably delight in this film.",3,Strolling Through Nuance Rather Than In-Your-Face Action,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,3770,"['New', 'World', 'many', 'detractors', 'Most', 'comment', 'slow', 'pace', 'film', 'undeniably', 'so', 'watching', 'grass', 'grow', 'commonly', 'heard', 'clich', 'eacute', ""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'defend', 'speed', 'story', 'slow', 'also', 'beautifully', 'put', 'together.Try', ""'re"", 'raft', 'placidly', 'flowing', 'river', 'Trees', 'wash', 'animals', 'nibble', 'grasses', 'shores', 'sky', 'beautiful', 'blue', 'sun', 'legs', 'rapids', 'are', 'few', 'easily', 'navigated', 'allowing', 'time', 'view', 'everything', 'Sound', 'boring', 'comfortable', 'death', 'stay', 'away', 'New', 'World', 'pleasant', 'enjoyable', 'give', 'film', 'try.What', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'how', 'story', 'dribbled', 'viewer', 'lap', 'roiled', 'like', 'cool', 'mountain', 'stream', 'allowed', 'time', 'everything', 'come', 'focus', ""n't"", 'Disney', 'Pocahontas', 'how', 'Jamestown', 'Settlement', 'came', 'be', 'boringness', 'beauty.Colin', 'Farrell', 'Captain', 'John', 'Smith', 'one', 'founders', 'original', 'colonies', 'shipmates', 'arrive', 'Americas', 'are', 'soon', 'building', 'fort', 'leader', 'group', 'Captain', 'Christopher', 'Newport', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'back', 'Europe', 'resupply', 'bring', 'more', 'colonists.Meanwhile', 'Jamestown', 'nearly', 'overrun', 'disease', 'power', 'struggles', 'native', 'Indians', 'Amidst', 'Captain', 'Smith', 'up', 'Pocahontas', 'pretty', 'inquisitive', 'daughter', 'local', 'chieftain', 'generosity', 'first', 'colonists', 'survive', 'mainly', 'love', 'Smith.After', 'Captain', 'Smith', 'colony', 'search', 'better', 'up', 'north', 'wrongly', 'reported', 'Pocahontas', 'love', 'perished', 'shipping', 'accident', 'Thus', 'despairs', 'eventually', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'tobacco', 'farmer.Pocahontas', 'later', 'requested', 'King', 'Queen', 'England', 'come', 'Court', 'meet', 'Thus', 'have', 'TWO', 'new', 'worlds', 'being', 'discovered', 'one', 'Europeans', 'America', 'one', 'Native', 'Americans', 'England', 'Europe', '.Pocahontas', 'later', 'Captain', 'Smith', 'still', 'alive', 'bitter', 'realization', 'decide', 'whom', 'stay', 'Smith', 'Rolfe.It', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'New', 'World', 'really', 'viewer', 'have', 'complained', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Oscars', 'not', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'disagree', 'New', 'World', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'doubt', 'feel', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'was', 'bit', 'better', 'eyes.The', 'wondrous', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'boon', 'film', 'Surrounding', 'viewer/listener', 'emulsion', 'color', 'sound', 'music', 'made', 'powerful', 'moments', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'Director', 'how', 'engage', 'audience', 'not', 'going', 'capture', 'who', 'watch', 'it.In', 'society', 'where', 'action', 'better', 'art', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'many', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'action', 'films', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'not', 'necessary', 'ingredient', 'movie', 'such', 'authenticity', 'seen', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'will', 'astound', 'many', 'know', 'blew', 'away', 're-creation', 'settlement', 'Native', 'American', 'huts', 'battle', 'gear', 'etc', 'are', 'pulled', 'archaeological', 'records', 'sources', 'Impressive.It', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'mention', 'how', 'little', 'dialogue', 'film', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'prefers', 'let', 'scenes', 'speak', 'rather', 'have', 'actors', 'actresses', 'voices', 'spoil', 'moment.I', 'guess', 'what', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'art', 'films', 'focus', 'nuance', 'rather', 'specifics', 'stay', 'away', 'New', 'World', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'letting', 'mind', 'meander', 'burbling', 'set', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'delight', 'film']",N/A

The project was bold and ambitious enough to peak one's interest, but unfortunately, the film could not deliver on its promise. Entire scenes drift by with nothing in particular being achieved to either advance the plot, the theme, or the premise of the film. Unfittingly, the soundtrack featured blaring snippets of concert music reminiscent of Richard Wagner, which would be great if The New World took place in 19th Century Venice instead of 17th Century America. Much more should be expected from James Horner whose brilliant work has enhanced such films as Field of Dreams, Braveheart, Legends of the Fall, and Titanic. The New World soundtrack is disaster almost on par with the latter film.The rest of film isn't much better. Although it vividly illustrates the limitless possibility of early Jamestown and the majesty of the unspoiled wilderness surrounding it, the visual images are offset by poor dialogue and what seems to be an overly zealous attempt to manufacture a poetic awe-inspiring masterpiece of a film. Nevertheless, The New World does manage to summon images of the first European settlers and the hardship they must have faced. From this standpoint, one can say it has some reflective value for those who appreciate human history...The New World begins by following the life of Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell). Landing in the New World with a convoy of Englishmen, he happens upon the Native American kingdom of Powhatan (August Schellenberg). Of course, most of the world knows the basic plotline. Smith's life is spared when his body is covered by Powhatan's beautiful daughter, Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher). Kilcher certainly displays the requisite physical beauty to portray the princess, but the script gives her little with which to work. Although a subject of controversy among historians, the film plays up the angle of a possible love affair between Smith and Pocahontas, but it accurately records her eventual marriage to John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and the couple's celebrated trip to London. But The New World's problems don't stem from historical accuracy, but rather from the fact that the preceding paragraph is a detailed account of everything that happens in a tedious two-hour fifteen-minute snoozer. In short, it's long and boring.As much as the film failed to live up to expectations, this much can be said for The New World: it accurately portrays the landscape of southeastern Virginia. That alone makes it immensely superior to Disney's Pocahontas which featured non-indigenous animals and forests peppered with waterfalls. Unfortunately, an entire generation of children gathered their personal knowledge of local geography from that film. From the perspective of set design, wardrobe, historical underpinnings, and the mere beauty of its images, The New World is a film to behold. However, from the standpoint of dialogue, plot, direction, and performance, The New World is an utter flop.

B Collins Jr.,"[26, 29]","The tale of the English settlers at Jamestown gets a wonderful retelling here revealing the hunger, struggle, disease, hardship, cold, and superstition that the early settlers encountered in the new world. I actually think this film does a wonderful job of revealing the wonderful paradise that was the new world before the arrival of the Europeans. The native people here are shown as primitive aboriginals, complete with tatoos, rituals, a power hierarchy and complex societies. The views of Virginia are stunning in their beauty, what a wonderful sight Virginia must have been to these early European arrivals, and how dreadful their lives could become as they learned how to survive in a world full of plants, insects, and animals they had never encountered before. The film gets 4 stars for giving us a glimpse of what the encounters between the old and new world must have been like for all parties involved.The love story between John Smith and Pocahontas is dream-like, a world not unlike Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Yet the story is one of JOhn Smith's betrayal of Pocahontas and the incredible price she pays for her loyalty to him. Yet the film is also one of her recovery from this obsessive love so that she is free to accept the love of her husband, John Rolfe. Colin Farrell does a great job of playing the brash, brave, adventurer John Smith. Smith sees the time he and Pocahontas were in love in her father's village as a dream that he must leave behind. She on the other hand saw it as a reality that she wished to pursue to the end.Thus in some ways the film is also about obsessive first love and the strong mature love that holds relationships together for decades. Christian Bale plays Rolfe, a tobacco farmer, who loves and marries Pocahontas, and fears losing her to Smith, but is finally rewarded in the end when she realizes that Smith was an obsession that is now passing and she must cling to the true love of her life, her partner, Rolfe.I found the Wagner music grand, sweeping, and perfect for the grandeur that is found in North America.

If you know anything about Jamestown, you quickly see the timeline is fuzzy. And there's historical inaccuracy, mainly with John Smith (Farrell) and Pocahontas's (Kilcher) relationship. In history she was approx 10 yrs old when they met. A lot has been made of her supposedly saving him in the Indian (excuse me - ""native American"") village, but if you research it you find its likely a tale that Smith invented years later. Smith was an adventurer and mercenary who had fought in or near Turkey before his Virginia adventure; the point is he was not a peaceful, innocent-eyed young guy as portrayed in this movie (he was already 27 yrs old - middle age for the time). And John Rolfe (Bale) was far more important than he is portrayed here - in fact, the commercial success of the colony is almost exclusively due to him and the tobacco he raised. There is no real reason to think Rolfe and Pocahontas were not the real love interest. It just occurred later than this movies allows.Christopher Plummer does his usual EXCELLENT acting. His Capt Newport is a little-known figure in American history today, although now there is a university in Va. named after him.I thought Kilcher made a wonderful Pocahontas despite the age question - who else would have made that part better?? Keep in mind Pocahontas was basically a child when the expedition arrived - she didn't need the bra- or bikini-like covering shown in the movie! She made friends with the explorers, then she disappeared for a couple of years, later to re-appear in her teens.The colony is correctly shown later in the movie as having 'too many chiefs', which is true to history. They brought mostly gentlemen-types on the first voyage, when what they needed were workers and craftsmen.The Indians were incredibly realistic, as were the weapons and the ships, etc, although the Indians were shown as too intellectual for reality. But they are correctly portrayed as ""players"" in the ensuing struggle for control of the area, rather than just as innocent ""pawns"". They had every chance to wipe out the colony in its first 10-15 years, but politics played its part on their side too. This movie reminds me of another favorite in that regard: 1993's ""Last of the Mohicans"".Unfortunately, plot clumsiness, twisting of history, and a musical score that (maybe) wasn't to a lot of peoples taste (though I liked it:) meant that this movie isn't in the class of ""Last of the Mohicans"" which was a much more powerful drama, especially on the political side...It was, however, good to see a film about Jamestown versus the far less important but generally better known Mayflower settlement.

Why doesn't someone sit down and actually uh maybe watch it first then go back and edit it? My problem is that I have seen so many fantastic films and then within the last few frames , maybe the last 10 minutes or so it totally ruins the whole film. I got this film, I hate slow movies but somehow this film grabbed my attention. I was feeling so emotionally and it was speaking to me . And I felt the energetic love it was so thick. The heartache and suspense...oh my gosh it was bringing me to life and awakening the romance that always dwells in the depths of my heart....then (spoiler alert*) he leave the love of his life for no reason only to see her again for like 5 minutes as some sort of hello goodbye ......rewrite the @#@#$% movie and give everyone a happy ending for God's sake. I mean why make a love story that ends in some distorted heartache. Thank God for them getting Christian bale for the other guys part or else i'd give it 2 stars. I'm sorry for anyone who loved this film. I do too and did until she meets Collin f. and it's like a firework that is a dud. all suspenseful and dramatic and it's building up and poof nothing. I mean they really really really had me. I am so surprised I sat through a slow movie because usually it's only if the wife has the remote and i'm too lazy to get up to do something else lol. But yes all by myself I was so into this film and then whoever wrote it got drunk or something and wrote the last 5 minutes in some sort of altered state. It is hard to put into words what I would change or how I feel about it because most of the time it's just a little tweak. I mean I understand what happened . Collin (john s.) understands she's moved on and had a kid and now married and I would like to think it was because he really loved her and had her best interest in mind. It's sort of like the notebook except she ends up with the one she 's not in love with. it's like a sad ending upon a sad movie. The only thing with it's hooks in us was the hooks of love which made us drool and long for some sort of real life 3d version of tasting the love which thickened the air like fog or heavy dew upon the grass. It made us breathe easy and made our heart feel funny with butterflies on the inside. We wanted to leave feeling with a sense of wonder and that all is well in the world. And that God does exist and love us. And that love is real and it will find us, and if it has found us it will never leave us. Instead I left feeling like I lost and my consolation prize is a lifetime of second place or never quite experience or owning the other half of my ""yang"" to my ""ying"" THis movie was a classic in my opinion right up until the last parts of the story. I prefer the cartoon instead lol. If I had the time and motivation I would write a bunch of scripts to show the Hollywood boys how it's done right.....one can only dreamthanks for reading!

I don't mind but they're have been serious troubling ones but thankfully, The New World isn't one of them. It's just too bad the actual film isn't that good. It's handsomely made but not as inviting as the film makes itself out to be.We know the story: native american girl Pocahontas falls in love with English settle John Smith. The Englishmen see the other side as savages while the natives see the other side as barbarians who take what they want with little regard for anything. So a love story in the middle of this isn't going to help.The film is of course quite nice to look at: trees standing, trees in the wind, still rivers, rushing rivers etc. But there's the problem since they're seems to be too much of it. Wanting to create a certain mood, the film is littered with images that seem fit to be in wildlife documentaries. They're nice but they're not that important but sure enough we get em in droves. The film is also rather slow. Characters rarely speak and even if they do, it's rather brief at times.Well the visuals hold up, despite their excessiveness, so how's the acting? Well, not quite good either. Colin Farrell, who's often been labelled the next best thing, pretty much as the same expression on his face the entire time: like he's come back from a funeral, all solemn and sad looking. Q'Orianka Filcher is of course the real find and hope we see more since she has a gravitas and a youthfulness that you can't help but notice. Christian Bale would've been a good character but since he literally drops in 1/2 hour before the movie's over, they don't develop him the way they should've.Is it well-made? Of course.

975323,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000EOTTTU,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 4]","Terrence Malick is simply the greatest living American filmmaker. Only Stanley Kubrick was his equal or superior. That's not to say that Martin Scorsese nor Woody Allen have not made great films, but they've both made stinkers in their careers, and neither has had a great film in over a decade (although I've heard good things about Allen's current Match Point). Not only is Malick the best filmmaker in the nation, despite The New World being only his 4th film in the 33 years since his first, Badlands, was released, but he may be the only filmmaker in the world who truly has developed his own cinematic language- apart from a reliance on the written words of a screenplay to carry the bulk of the film's art and story. He is also the greatest American historian in the cinematic art form. It's his fort&eacute; alone.Better still, he never condescends in his films. He presents his tales sparely, with cinematography, enough dialogue to convey the scene, and occasional voiceovers that play off the visuals and imagery to leave a poetic dissonance in the viewer's mind that the mind is forced to fill in the synapse with its own meaning, thus creating narrative from symbols, visuals, and their interplay. It truly is a different and new form of screenwriting; and a great form, one wholly enmeshed in the medium that birthed it. What makes it great are not the words, but their relation to what is on the screen. Simple declarative and/or descriptive sentences, such as Smith's descriptions of Pocahontas, `She exceeded the others not only in beauty and proportion, but in wit and spirit, too,' or Rolfe's ideas about her, `When first I saw her, she was regarded as someone broken, lost,' transcend Shakespearean depth in this new medium, and in centuries hence Terrence Malick will get his due as one of the giants of the `early', first century of human cinema.The actual meat of this film is the by now almost fabular tale of John Smith (Colin Farrell) and his `love'- Pocahontas (although that name is never used in the film)- during the settling of Jamestown by Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) and his charges. All the familiar facts are presented- he is captured by her tribe, her father, Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg), releases him when she saves him from death. He grows to respect the Indians, returns to Jamestown, abandons her when she is outcast by her father for supposedly betraying her people by feeding the English during the winter, then giving them seeds to grow crops, and she ends up marrying John Rolfe (Christian Bale), a kind widower whose son has also died, taking the Christian name Rebecca, giving him another son, and wowing the English court.If film can achieve sheer apports with its art, then Terrence Malick is the lone levitator and magician around. The only minor negative point in this film, and it's very minor, is that as well-done as the voiceovers are the film might have been better off without them, for some of the poetic statements of Smith, Rolfe, and Pocahontas seem a bit over the heads of their 17th Century low born utterers- unlike those in his earlier films. Of all the films that are getting Oscar buzz- from worthy films like Capote and Shopgirl, to blatantly PC fodder like Brokeback Mountain, this is- easily- the best film that last year produced. Yet, it will only get some cinematography, editing, scoring, or other minor nods.There is a ritualistic feel to this film that glues one's eyes to it, from its sublime opening to its choral ending shot of New World trees reaching sunward, even to its non-standard non-black screen credits at the end. This is not a film, but an experience, and that is not me trying to sound poetic, but really defining the film. See it, then get the DVDs of his earlier films and see that real, great art still exists.

If you know what you are going to see, in this case, you'll be better off because if you are expecting an action-packed historical adventure story, you will be bitterly disappointed.This is s-l-o-w moving, very slow, and fairly long at two hours and 15 minutes. If you enjoyed ""The Girl With The Pearl Earring,"" you'll like this. Those two films are similar in beauty and pace.If you love good visuals, which I do, then this is a DVD you want to view. Terrence Malick has directed only four movies in 33 years and all four are beautifully filmed, the best being the second: ""Days Of Heaven."" I would rank this second to that film in terms of beauty.Cinematography-wise, there is a lot to like in The New World, especially the scenes on the water, which are magnificent. I wish there more of them. What we see is Jamestown, Va., in the year 1607, so this film is about as rural as you're ever going to see America.It's the story of Pocahontas (although she's never called that in the movie) and her relationship to two men: John Smith (Colin Farrell) and John Rolfe (Christian Bale). Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher plays the Indian girl who is given the Christian name ""Rebecca"" later in the film and this woman is mesmerizing throughout. What an innocently-interesting face!Without giving it away, the ending haunted me for a few days afterward. In the end, it is a powerful story, not just scene after scene of gorgeous photography (which it also is).

Mainly that's a compliment but anyone familiar with his work knows there's something slightly....critical in that statement. Mallick's most recent film, The New World, is a courageous undertaking that blends one of the prettiest scores ever composed, with shots of absolute gorgeousness. Here we get a sense of the beauty of the central Atlantic coast of North America as it must have been in pre-colonial times, with its vast, intricately-interwoven realm of forests, marshes, and meadows, all laid out under the immensity of an unpolluted sky. Mallick's pace is brave and it challenges a viewer to be equal to it. He takes his time as his camera pans slowly past what seems individual blades of grass and single leaves on majestic cathedrals of trees. So powerful is all this beauty it nearly grows overpowering to the senses, and can come off as both innocently offered, and mentally tiring. What The New World needed was more involvement from its human cast. Scarcely a hundred sentences are uttered start to finish in a lengthy running time of nearly two and a quarter hours. The tribal life of the aboriginal peoples was, one discerned, probably accurate to the smallest detail, including a shot inside a charnel house; the English colonists, their fort, houses, ship, and later in the manor in England with its formal gardens (a stark contrast to the free expression of nature in the  untamed forests of North America) these too are careful recreations that reflect what was there in this period. The problem is there is a lack of balance in The New World and the tale of Pocahontas and the two foreign men who come to win her love definitely takes a back seat to Mallick's visuals, and seems lost amid the scale of this motion picture. The New World is a beautiful visual poem, but it barely qualifies as containing any story at all.",3,Visually Imposing But The Plot Was Barely An Afterthought,1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,1908,"['Terrence', 'Mallick', 'films', 'way', 'one', 'else', 'quite', 'Mainly', 'compliment', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'work', 'something', 'slightly', '.critical', 'statement', 'Mallick', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'New', 'World', 'courageous', 'undertaking', 'one', 'prettiest', 'ever', 'composed', 'shots', 'absolute', 'gorgeousness', 'Here', 'get', 'sense', 'beauty', 'central', 'Atlantic', 'coast', 'North', 'America', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pre-colonial', 'times', 'vast', 'intricately-interwoven', 'realm', 'forests', 'marshes', 'meadows', 'laid', 'out', 'immensity', 'unpolluted', 'sky', 'Mallick', 'pace', 'brave', 'viewer', 'be', 'equal', 'time', 'camera', 'slowly', 'past', 'what', 'individual', 'blades', 'grass', 'single', 'leaves', 'majestic', 'cathedrals', 'trees', 'So', 'powerful', 'beauty', 'nearly', 'overpowering', 'senses', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'innocently', 'offered', 'mentally', 'tiring', 'What', 'New', 'World', 'needed', 'was', 'more', 'involvement', 'human', 'cast', 'Scarcely', 'hundred', 'sentences', 'are', 'uttered', 'start', 'finish', 'lengthy', 'running', 'time', 'nearly', 'two', 'quarter', 'hours', 'tribal', 'life', 'aboriginal', 'peoples', 'was', 'one', 'discerned', 'probably', 'accurate', 'smallest', 'detail', 'including', 'shot', 'charnel', 'house', 'English', 'colonists', 'fort', 'houses', 'ship', 'later', 'manor', 'England', 'formal', 'gardens', 'stark', 'contrast', 'free', 'expression', 'nature', 'untamed', 'forests', 'North', 'America', 'too', 'are', 'careful', 'recreations', 'reflect', 'what', 'was', 'there', 'period', 'problem', 'lack', 'balance', 'New', 'World', 'tale', 'Pocahontas', 'two', 'foreign', 'men', 'who', 'come', 'win', 'love', 'definitely', 'back', 'seat', 'Mallick', 'visuals', 'lost', 'scale', 'motion', 'picture', 'New', 'World', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'poem', 'barely', 'containing', 'story']",N/A

Thats the main fault I have with this film is that there really seems to be no reason what so ever to watch it.  No one speaks to one another, I mean I think Colin Farrell utters maybe five words in total (minus his narative scenes) and when he's spoken to he just stares at the person with this look of complete stupidity.  A breath of fresh air is newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher who plays her role so perfectly you can't help but love her as John Smith loved her.  FOr the most part shes the only part of this film worth watching...I mean, Malick has vision, it's just not right for this film which comes off more like a documentary then a motion picture.  I worry about the people who see the 3 hour version he's planning to release.  I mean, this movie dragged on for so long with nothing to keep you interested.  I fear for Colin's career because he keeps making BAD decitions, but at least in Alexander he had speaking lines.  Christopher Plummer was in all of five minutes of the movie and Christian Bale is a BORE!  Another bone I have to pick is the musical score which is played so loudly that it pounds you head and leaves you wanting to rip your ears off.  If there were a mute button this film would be beautiful, random shots of water in a brook and spiders on a tree and Colin Farrell kissing a newborn and  Q'Orianka Kilcher running around like a deer...it's beautiful...but with the repetative narrating, Smith lamenting over how he can't be around her and Bale lamenting over how Pocahntas won't love him the way she loves Smith...it's really annoying and the ending...OH GOD DON'T GET ME STARTED!  The end of this movie is just freaking RETARDED!  It just ends, just like that, like he ran out of film, I mean, he wasted so much of it on spiders and water and crap like that that he didn't have enough time to shot a decent ending to the film.

I was kind of bored up to the part where John Smith vanishes, and then out popped Christian Bale and I thought I'd stick around for the rest.

Basina,"[2, 5]","This film is Director Terrence Malik's script interpretation of the first meeting between 17th Century Virginia's Native Tribes and European colonists. It is marketed as Pocahontas's (Q'orianka Kilcher) first meeting/love affair with explorer John Smith. (Colin Farrell)Mr. Malik's signature film shows the love story between curious, playful Pocahontas and the conflicted explorer John Smith.  Language, age and environment barriers are shown through the eyes of Mr. Malik. The nod for Cinematography is not by chance. This beautiful looking film is deliberately lacking dialogue for historical effect that showed the true ethnic barriers. A narrative voice is utilized for effective story telling of John Smith's writtens.The romance and passion between two totally different ethnic people from different cultural roles are encompassed in this historical noted timeframe. The clash or initial meeting of ethnic races was just the start of things to come. The brutal reality of that era is portrayed authentic by Malik. But first and foremost this film is a love story shown through the eyes of a one-of-a-kind director Terrence Malik utilizing body movement and visualization.The ""making of"" bonus material is worth a viewing. The behind the scenes chapter tells a story of the rough conditions and preproduction detailed events of trying to give this film an authentic 17th century Virginia settlement feel. I.e. Tribal movement, dress, dialog and set construction.If you are looking for Dances with Wolves, Last of the Mohicans or a Black Robe film this is not it.

I was under the impression that Pocahontas had married John Smith.  This movie was probably more enjoyable for people who actually know something about history.  I knew that she had been taken to England by her husband, where she died, but I didn't know that her husband was John Rolfe, not John Smith.  I was a little put out that viewers were never even told the name of the man she married. I had to go to the internet to find out who he was. Again, I don't know my history very well.  When John Rolfe was ""officially"" presented to Pocahontas, we were subjected to more of this ""narrative"" stuff, and as far as I can remember, his name was not said.  I'm not a big fan of ""narrative"" type movies.  The three main leads were very good in their roles, particularly the young woman who played Pocahontas.  Colin Ferrel and Christian Bale were excellent also.  As for John Smith, all he did was walk around ""emoting""  But ahhh...Colin Ferrel can really ""emote"".  Also, we were never told how young Pocahontas really was...she was 12 years old when she met John Smith.  This smacks a little of ""statutory rape,"" but of course pre-teen marriages were a common occurance during this time period.  Look at Romeo and Juliet...they were what...12 or 13?

English explorer's land on the west coast of North America, near what today is Virginia, and build a settlement named Jamestown. They encounter the Naturals, as Captain John smith (Colin Farrell) calls the indigenous Indian population. Initially there is a uneasy period as the two cultures get acquainted. John Smith takes a small party up river to meet the Naturals. As is often the case with Malick's films nature is brought to the forefront. The inland landscape is like a confusing labyrinth that overwhelms the explorers. John Smith loses his comrades when they go off exploring in the marshes. Like a large spider's web, the natural world traps the men. This is a beautiful, but dangerous world that the Europeans have not yet tamed. The Naturals have learned to live within the landscape. Like a spider that is shown making its way over a tree trunk the Naturals have found a way to coexist with nature, but for the Europeans this is not the case as their situation deteriorates.John Smith is captured by the Naturals and has his life spared by Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher). He lives amongst the Naturals for a time, learning their ways. A romance develops between Smith and Pocahontas, but once the Naturals realize that the Europeans intend to stay the Naturals are determined to chase them away and attack the settlers. Nothing is resolved, but many die on both sides. Eventually John Smith leaves the settlement and heads north leaving the Princess behind. The film beautifully unfolds as each new chapter reveals itself. The broken hearted Pocahontas eventually meets another European John Rolfe (Christian Bale) who she marries. Locations are then switched as Pocahontas sails to England with her European husband. She sees the Old World with its tall buildings and manicured gardens, and sheds her familiar clothing for that of the city dwellers. In this world we see nature as having been tamed by mankind. The trees are sculptured and ordered into distinct rows and patterns.When Pocahontas again meets up with John Smith, it is a meeting of the old memories with the new. ""The New World"" reflects on the notion of change. Pocahontas is the free spirit that embraces and loves the world that she lives in. She's also the one that bridges the gap between the Naturals and the Europeans. This movie is a meditation about embracing life and all that it has to offer, and we experience this love of life through the exuberance of Pocahontas.

975350,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B000EOTTTU,Eric S. Kim,"[3, 3]","Terrence Malick is known for creating very a different sort of cinematic art. Like the late Stanley Kubrick, he moves away from standard Hollywood material, and creates a style of his own. What we see in his films are brief narratives by different characters, beautiful shots of natural scenery, and some moments that place no insight on sound (we just see the beauty of the surroundings, and the only sound we hear is either the breeze or distant animals). If you've seen The Thin Red Line (one of my favorite films), then you know what I'm talking about. Like his other films, this one delves into the meaning of life, love, war, hate, violence, etc. But now, in the new millennium, we have seen something different from Malick. The New World is yet another beautiful film by the master filmmaker, and like his other films, it relies on history when telling the story. Here we have the creation of Jamestown, Virginia, and the bond between John Smith and Pocahontas. While it isn't entirely historically accurate, it does borrow certain elements from popular American folklore respectively.It's 1607, and the English set out to found the land of North America. After setting foot on the land, Captain John Smith is captured by a tribe of Native Americans, and is about to be executed. However, one of the young women wants him alive, and he is now considered a prisoner. The woman turns out to be Pocahontas, and she and Smith fall in love. This rather complicates matters between the English and the Native Americans, and what follows is a breathtaking movement of beauty, mysticism, and new discoveries about life.Almost everything is what you would expect in a Malick film. Nature shots, voice-overs, philosophical implications, the works. From beginning to end, it is more of a spiritual experience rather than an entertaining one. But this probably wouldn't have fully succeeded if it weren't for the outstanding cast. Colin Farrell, Q'Orianka Kilcher, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale, and Wes Studi make an interesting combination. Their performances are absolutely stunning (there is no melodrama in the way they interact with each other). Cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki is really a sight to see: the dark colors really add to the mystical atmosphere that is conveyed through this film. I wish I would say something special about James Horner's music, but most of it had been cut out and replaced by classical music. I guess I could say that Mozart's Piano Concerto and Wagner's Das Rheingold were unexpected but nonetheless pleasurable additions to the soundtrack.It's pretty obvious that this movie is not for everyone. Anyone who is looking for an exciting film might want to look elsewhere. This is a slow-moving, yet hauntingly effective motion picture which lacks nonstop action, witty dialogue, and softcore sex. I personally have come to admire it, despite the last thirty minutes of the film being a bit plodding at times. It's as great as The Thin Red Line, and I would happily recommend it to those who love to see some fine cinematic art.Grade: A-P.S.People say that the extended cut is much better than the original 135-minute cut. If that's the case, then I might as well watch it and see for myself.

""Oooooo,"" I thought, ""I can't wait for this to come out!"" Well, I waited and waited and waited and still nothing ever came out. To my surprise, I discovered earlier this spring that it had already had its run at the box office and apparently none of the cinemas here in Memphis, TN. desired to carry it. So . . . I waited for the DVD to come out and rushed out to Circuit City to grab it on the morning of its release. I was full of anticipation all the way home about how good this ""historical"" movie was going to be. Would it be like ""Braveheart,"" or ""The Patriot,"" or maybe ""Troy,"" or even ""King Arthur"" or ""Alexander""? So I settled down and waited for the intense action and suspense to unfold. And I waited and I waited and I waited!If you, like me, are under the impression that this movie is an ""epic"" telling or re-telling of history, or if you desire the intensity of action then you had better look elsewhere. For all of these reasons I was totally disappointed. Yet, you might ask why I would give it a 5 star review. Hmmmmm, well let's see. This movie is great for one, even if it is completely NOT what I expected.At the center of this movie is a love story. In fact, it's more of a love story that just so happens to be set in 17th-century Virginia rather than a movie based on the founding of Jamestown that just so happens to include a love story. Does this make any sense? I've read a few other reviews that call this movie ""poetic"" and I can't agree more, although I've never really thought of a motion picture as being ""poetic."" If we want to run with the poetry analogy then I'll say that this is more of a ""Tintern Abbey"" than a ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner."" It's a ""Dover Beach"" as opposed to a ""Dulce et Decorum Est."" In other words, it's subtle, reflective, surreal, and even pensive. Sure there are a few short battle sequences, but it is centered more around the spoken thoughts of Pochahantas/Rebecca, John Smith, and John Rolfe. It's sort of a dramatic monologue if we wish to keep the poetry analogy alive.While Christian Bale and Colin Farrell occasionally give convincing portrayals of brave, adventurous explorers, it is not really this aspect of their character that is highlighted. Instead, we delve into the innermost confines of each character's soul as this movie unfolds. We see firsthand the inevitable UNcompatibility of European and Native cultures and how diificult it truly must have been for the earliest settlers of this country. Indeed, the movie places quite a bit of emphasis on the harsh conditions faced by these first settlers and actually exposes the pitiable circumstances that rendered them virtually helpless. One may stop and wonder if we could do the same thing today. Who for the love of God would leave England with it's bountiful fields, lush gardens, paved streets, and brick houses with glass windows for the rustic ""stick and mud"" abodes of the New World? The contrast between the two worlds is certainly striking from the European perspective.I had high hopes of showing this movie to my high school class, and I suspected it would be worthwhile for a U.S. history class or an English class that focuses on American literature. I suspect, however, that most adolescent minds will be bored to tears with this one. While I can't wholeheartedly recommend that you go and buy it today, I will insist upon at least a trip to Blockbuster for a weekend rental.Again (and pardon me for sounding arrogant), this is a ""thinking person's"" movie.

975353,A1UYL5GIQ8YE77,B000EOTTTU,Fred L. Houpt,"[5, 6]","There is something that deeply grips me about this movie.  I really had very little historical knowledge about the Pocahontas story.  I eagerly sought out this film when it first came out because I was so moved by Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"".  When I saw The New World"" I was transformed; I simply had to know more about the drama.  I read 4 books on the subject until I was satiated.  I have watched my copy of the original cut many times and just a few days ago I bought the extended version and have seen it once.As I was watching the longer version I kept thinking whether I liked it or not, comparing and contemplating the effect of all the added material. I am quite divided about the outcome.  From one point of view Malick's extended version has skewed the film even more towards the romance between Captain John Smith and the young and nubile Pocahontas.  The impact this has is to deepen the sense of loss and suffering that Pocahontas endures when she (thinks) she has lost Smith.  The extended version also shows in much more detail how much Smith bonded with and enjoyed his time with the Powhatten natives.  There are other colors that are brought out.  The relationship between Smith and some of the other leaders of the colonists is strongly enhanced and to good effect.  The touching conversation Pocahontas has with Opachancanough, her uncle, at the end of the film, highlights her sense of alientation, confusion but a strong sense of identity with her fellow Powhatten.What I learned while reading those books is that the movie enhances a great deal of myth.  While achieving a high degree of the look and feel of the historical realities of the time period, including re-building an accurate Jamestown replica, the use of clothing and armaments of the era, the movie weaves facts and fiction into a seamless web.  One only has to repeat this mantra and all will be well: this is a Hollywood movie, not a documentary.From another point of view the added material was by and large not needed as the imagination could have filled in some of the details.  They are in some ways two different movies; the first version was tightly edited and cut and was stripped bare of excess dialogue and the emphasis then gravitated towards many scenes in which actors said nothing or just emoted with their faces.  The second cut is much more wordy with much more voice overs.  I actually found the voice overs badly cut as they often were right on top of other people speaking and one could not follow what people were saying; it was distracting and did not add to clarity.  Again I found Colin Farrell's voice-overs spoken a bit too softly and it was hard to make out what he was saying.If I had to choose one version, at this point, I would opt for the original even though the added material is just as lush and beautiful to look at.  Sometimes the less said the better.  The story, although not historically accurate in so many ways, is very sad.  Seen from the perspective of the entire North American natives, this is the beginning of the end of their civilization.",5,Extended version still a great film,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,3077,"['something', 'grips', 'movie', 'really', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'historical', 'knowledge', 'Pocahontas', 'story', 'eagerly', 'sought', 'out', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'Malick', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'When', 'saw', 'New', 'World', 'was', 'transformed', 'simply', 'had', 'know', 'more', 'drama', 'read', '4', 'books', 'subject', 'was', 'satiated', 'have', 'watched', 'copy', 'original', 'cut', 'many', 'times', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'bought', 'extended', 'version', 'have', 'seen', 'was', 'watching', 'longer', 'version', 'kept', 'thinking', 'liked', 'not', 'comparing', 'contemplating', 'effect', 'added', 'material', 'am', 'quite', 'divided', 'outcome', 'one', 'point', 'view', 'Malick', 'extended', 'version', 'skewed', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'towards', 'romance', 'Captain', 'John', 'Smith', 'young', 'nubile', 'Pocahontas', 'impact', 'deepen', 'sense', 'loss', 'suffering', 'Pocahontas', 'when', 'thinks', 'lost', 'Smith', 'extended', 'version', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'how', 'much', 'Smith', 'bonded', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'Powhatten', 'natives', 'are', 'other', 'colors', 'are', 'brought', 'out', 'relationship', 'Smith', 'other', 'leaders', 'colonists', 'strongly', 'enhanced', 'good', 'effect', 'touching', 'conversation', 'Pocahontas', 'Opachancanough', 'uncle', 'end', 'film', 'sense', 'alientation', 'confusion', 'strong', 'sense', 'identity', 'fellow', 'Powhatten.What', 'learned', 'reading', 'books', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'myth', 'achieving', 'high', 'degree', 'look', 'feel', 'historical', 'realities', 'time', 'period', 'including', 're-building', 'accurate', 'Jamestown', 'replica', 'use', 'clothing', 'armaments', 'era', 'movie', 'facts', 'fiction', 'seamless', 'web', 'One', 'only', 'repeat', 'mantra', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary.From', 'point', 'view', 'added', 'material', 'was', 'large', 'not', 'needed', 'imagination', 'could', 'have', 'filled', 'details', 'are', 'ways', 'two', 'different', 'movies', 'first', 'version', 'was', 'tightly', 'edited', 'cut', 'was', 'stripped', 'bare', 'excess', 'dialogue', 'emphasis', 'then', 'gravitated', 'towards', 'many', 'scenes', 'actors', 'said', 'nothing', 'just', 'emoted', 'second', 'cut', 'much', 'more', 'wordy', 'much', 'more', 'voice', 'overs', 'actually', 'found', 'voice', 'overs', 'badly', 'cut', 'often', 'were', 'right', 'top', 'other', 'people', 'speaking', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'follow', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'saying', 'was', 'distracting', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'clarity', 'Again', 'found', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'voice-overs', 'spoken', 'bit', 'too', 'softly', 'was', 'hard', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'saying.If', 'had', 'choose', 'one', 'version', 'point', 'would', 'opt', 'original', 'even', 'added', 'material', 'just', 'lush', 'beautiful', 'look', 'less', 'said', 'better', 'story', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'sad', 'Seen', 'perspective', 'entire', 'North', 'American', 'natives', 'beginning', 'end', 'civilization']",N/A

Some of the sets were rather good and it gave the feeling of a wild frontier in a strange new land. The photography was quite good. The acting was of the slow moving school where little is happening. The savages were, well, savages. I really can't remember seeing such a dreary depiction of American Natives. The fight scenes looked like really primitive brawls, which they might well have been.

975359,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000EOTTTU,Grady Harp,"[8, 13]","Terrence Malick is a master of understatement and it is that quality of his writing and directing that makes THE NEW WORLD so luminous an experience for the viewer.  Though the historical material in this film has been told and written and filmed to exhaustion, Malick finds that awe and wonder as the Old World of the King James' England puts ashore on the pure and unsoiled land of Virginia of 1607 to an audience of naively innocent 'naturals' who are as fascinated with the arrivals of the visitors as the English are curious yet fearful of the 'savages' they may face in this new place. This is an interior film that just happens to be filmed in the wonders of the meadows and rivers and seaside of nature resplendent.Malick has wisely elected to have the meeting between the naturals and the English remain in their own languages: the Indians speak a beautiful language that is not translated for the audience, a fact that adds to the feeling of 'the other' on both sides.  And it is this separateness that makes the story credible. Upon landing Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) cancels the scheduled hanging of Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) and sets rules for the newly formed Jamestown, which he soon leaves to return to England, leaving Captain Smith in charge.  It is Smith's duty to meet with the naturals in an attempt to gain needed food supplies.  The magic that occurs with this meeting of 'the stranger' with the naturals is the epitome of discovery.  Smith is saved from execution by the Chief Powhatan's (August Schellenberg) favored daughter Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) and lives with the naturals, learning their innocence of spirit and falling in love with Pocahontas.But Smith is returned to his fort, suffers misadventures among his own men, sustains attacks by the disenchanted naturals, and eventually returns to England, telling his friend to inform Pocahontas that he has drowned.  Pocahontas is outcast from her community because of her kindness to the English and is placed in Jamestown where she is 'assimilated' by the new arrival of English.  Among the new arrivals is John Rolfe (Christian Bale) who falls in love with Pocahontas and though she does not love Rolfe she consents to the arranged marriage because Rolfe is kind and because she believes her beloved Smith to be dead.  The two have a child and Rolfe takes his little family to England where Pocahontas is presented at court for her invaluable aid to the English.  She discovers Smith is still alive, dies, and Rolfe and son return to Jamestown. No spoilers, these: this is historically accurate reporting of stories we have all known from grade school.All of this majestic story is told primarily in silence with the stream of conscious dialogue from each character spoken in voice over.  The sounds of nature accompany the action in an eerily perfect manner.  Many have praised James Horner's musical score for this film and it is a score that contributes to the beauty of the film: the fact is there is little original music here, the use of Wagner's 'Das Rheingold' accompanies the extended opening and recurs for the big moments while Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 is used extensively for the quiet moments.  Yes, it works, but there is not much other original music to praise.But that is the only quibble with those who have raved about this film.  It does weave its spell under Malick's understanding eye and is beautifully cast with first-rate actors who are asked to render their characters physically and with their eyes rather than words.  Farrell, Kilcher, Bale, Thewlis, Plummer and the large supporting cast are exemplary.  What, then, Malick has given us in this majestic film is that sense of wonder of the unknown, the thin thread between curiosity and threat that spins the coming together of cultures.  And that sense of awe is still propelling the forces of the world today.  If only all such interactions would hold the respect of this initial encounter. Highly recommended.

For example, 1953's Knights of the Round Table, with Robert Taylor as Lancelot and Ava Gardner as Guinevere, is laughably awful. Sure there's Technicolor and pageantry and Miklos Rozsa's score, but that version of the often-filmed legend stinks to high heaven. On the other hand, we have a masterpiece like 1959's BEN-HUR, which richly deserved all the 11 Oscars it won at the Academy Awards. With the re-emergance of the widescreen process (originally premiered in 1930's THE BIG TRAIL) in the early 1950's, Hollywood scrambled to churn out one ""historical"" drama after another. Later on, with the disillusionment over Vietnam and such, we started to see more anti-establishment and politically correct slanted historical films.Along comes director Terence Mallick, who graces us with THE NEW WORLD, a film that's more of an immersion into, an experience of the times than just a straightforward drama about the early days of the Jamestown settlement. How authentic is this? Check online and in the DVD's featurettes the research and lengths that Mallick went to in pursuing historical accuracy. Add to that his sense of visual poetry and you have, in my experience, the most incredibly beautiful and unique historical epic ever filmed.I am so pleased that New Line has released this longer Director's Cut of Mallick's cinamtic masterpiece!

975366,A3TXY9E0HDWMXK,B000EOTTTU,Howard Schumann,"[9, 14]","With the newest Terrence Malick film, The New World, one looks for words that express a quality beyond beautiful, but there is no language. It is a work of stunning cinematic poetry whose appreciation, I believe, will grow with the passage of time, though it may never appeal to a wide audience. I came away from watching The New World with a feeling of having traveled back in time to a land of pristine beauty where the vigorous dream of establishing a sane civilization was still alive, if only for a brief moment. Malick attempts a retelling of that dream, specifically the vision of Pocahontas, the Indian princess, daughter of Algonquian Chief Powhatan, who imagined a country where both Europeans and Natives could live together without bloodshed.While actual events may have been somewhat different, Malick takes the story at face value, enhancing it only with voiceovers that allow us to enter the minds of the characters and feel what they are feeling. The film opens with the arrival of three English ships docking on the James River in Virginia in 1607 to the music of Wagner's Das Rheingold. It then describes the early days of the settlers, their near starvation, the clashes with the Indians, and the relationship between Pocahontas and Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell), a rebellious English explorer awaiting execution for insubordination. When the Indians capture Smith during an expedition to seek trading partners, he is threatened with death until Pocahontas saves him from execution by cradling his head in her lap and laying her head on his shoulders.The Captain and Pocahontas become friends but the true nature of their relationship is clouded in myth and allegory. In the film, however, the Captain and his Indian princess express a love so intense that it suggests a state of grace. As Smith is drawn under her spell, he thinks about abandoning his life, to ""start over.... exchange this false life for a true one.... give up the name of Smith."" But the thought is fleeting. After Pocahontas warns the Captain of an impending raid by her villagers, her father sends her into exile. The settlers take her hostage, however, convert her to Christianity (not shown in the film), and dress her in frumpy English attire, but she is content just being close to the man she loves.Smith leaves Pocahontas, however, to explore the Canadian North for a trade route to the Indies, instructing a friend to tell her after two months that he died at sea. His betrayal and their doomed love affair serve as a metaphor for the failure of the Natives and the Europeans to live together in harmony. The spark in Pocahontas' life flickers but when a new settler, tobacco farmer John Rolfe (Christian Bale), arrives, he falls in love with her and asks her to marry him. She must now decide whether to follow her head and marry Rolfe or her heart, holding out for the return of Captain Smith. Her resolution of this dilemma takes her to England where the process of discovery takes on a new meaning.The role of Pocahontas is played by fourteen-year old Q'orianka Kilcher in a powerful and brilliant performance that never strikes a false note. While the director has excised most of the dialogue, little is required to convey the depth of feeling written on her soulful face or on the faces of Smith and Rolfe.Whoever Pocahontas really was, Malick depicts her as a spiritual force and the film achieves transcendence through her vision. The New World is a meditation on love and loss, innocence and betrayal, and the limitations of a society based on material progress.It is also a lament for the civilization that might have been: a multi-ethnic society rich in spirituality and closeness to nature, inhabited by people with a sense of community, devoid of fear.

975367,A1RDPBXEFS35K9,B000EOTTTU,H. Paul Moon,"[6, 13]","There is the cliche of remarking that you've just seen the best movie ever made.  It's usually a moment of adrenaline or fashion-consciousness, and the grandeur is eclipsed by your next favorite movie, a few months or weeks down the line.Being fully aware of that cliche, I will say for myself that I invoked it recently for The New World, but here's the exception:  I have been reserving that distinction for a film called Koyaanisqatsi since my mid-teens.  Given the intervening two decades of nothing much to rattle me, this film is an absolute epiphany on the scale of literally improving the vernacular of cinema.Whenever I had to defend my answer ""Koyaanisqatsi"" to puzzled looks after the innocent question, ""What's your favorite movie?"", it always involved the inevitable failure to describe what it's actually about.  There haven't been many like it (aside from the subsequent two sequels in its trilogy, and the ""spinoffs"" by its cinematographer in Baraka and Chronos), though Koyaanisqatsi arguably shook the ground that moviemaking is built on even today.  The closest populist reference to the style of Koyaanisqatsi is stop-motion photography of landscapes, such as unnaturally fast-moving clouds across the desert.  And of course, there was the ""minimalist""/maximalist music of Philip Glass.Some have tried to call this ""environmental cinema.""  If they were referring to the existence of pretty vistas, they were missing the point.  Much like minimalism in the development of contemporary music in the late 20th Century, cinema found a language that moderated its attention down to context and pulse.  Storytelling through moving pictures has usually not been so attentive.  Largely this is a humanistic instinct, which isn't all bad.  We are drawn to stories that enlarge the human experience -- ultimately a harmless dishonesty that fakes some kind of order to human behavior.  But the braver thing to do is to depict -- as a first priority -- man and woman within their environment, between humans and non-humans, and between humans and other human civilizations.  The storytelling that manifests from such a paradigm will lack in personal drama what it makes up for in a rich experience of ""thinking and moving"" pictures.Looking back on the title belt of Koyaanisqatsi within my little world of all-time favorites, I can see now why The New World rattled me so well.  The two films' agendas and esthetics are one in the same -- the closest genre to these ironically is science fiction, which can, at its best, evoke the awe of realizing that humans dwell within something dramatically more important, and too important to understand.  Better to make your point by observing that truth with humility, than to wrap things up with a slick cut and a thud!  After seeing The New World, I literally doubted my ability to see any other film the same way again.  That is a ""review"" sounding like hyperbole, but sometimes you just wake up to something totally right.

975368,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000EOTTTU,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 4]","This version has many positive points indeed. For one the Indians are real Indians. For two the Indian life style is a lot more realistic than in most other versions and what happens in the films is more credible than in most other versions. It is highly probably that the Indians were a lot more hostile than thought as soon as they understood the English were going and planning to stay, and thus Smith had lied to them and promised their departure whereas he knew it was a lie.The other side is just as realistic. The English die like flies the first year of diseases, cold and hunger, and also because of the Indians but this vision of the English is also realistic in the extreme violence they were confronted to and the extreme violence they submitted the Indians to. The Indians tried to overwhelm them with numbers but the English just burnt the villages and killed everyone, burnt the harvests and the crops forcing the Indians to go away or starve before being exterminated. The film is even clear about the intention of pushing the Indians away from the very start.But apart from that realistic dimension of the film, the story itself is an embellished love story that has little to do with what probably really happened. Pocahontas was ten when Smith appeared and not a grown young woman. Her religious position and training is not at all explicated and thus the Indian culture is not at all exploited as a highly spiritual culture. It is reduced to some kind of ritualistic, superstitious, extremely ""primitive"" behavior and relishing paint and other body adornments. All testimonies show clearly that the Indian civilization was a highly advanced one in the field of mental and spiritual empathy with other people and with the other side of reality, the supernatural side that more or less dictates its energetic lead to this world.But the worst part is the erasing of the real chronology and the role of Argall in the game. The abduction is supposedly coming after the ""father"" of Pocahontas had banned her from the tribe into exile into another tribe of the Powhatan alliance. That erases the Indian husband Pocahontas had, and her Indian son. That erases the abduction, the killing of her Indian husband and the escape of her Indian son who had been moved to some relatives when the Indians realized Pocahontas was being fooled into abduction. That also more or less makes the abduction easier: she believes she is being saved from exile by her Captain Smith.The fable of Smith being saved by her is of course central though this is only in the second version of the event that Smith gave in 1624, two years after the bloody upheaval of the Indians, which had an obvious impact on the whole testimony on the colony up to 1622. In his first account of 1608 there is nothing about his life being menaced and it being saved then by Pocahontas. The love affair is of course justified by that salvation.Then the marriage with John Rolfe is hyper-unrealistic. During her abduction she was raped. She gave birth to her mixed-blood son before being married to John Rolfe and that son, strangely enough is named after the governor of the Colony, Sir Thomas Dale, who had had access to her during her captivity, and even worse, John Rolfe, the secretary of the colony, did not register his ""own"" son on the books of the colony, showing that either the boy was not his son and he did not care registering him, or that he was considered as a non-entity because he was a mixed-blood, revealing the basic racism of the English towards the Indians and the clear anti-Indian policy of the Church of England. All that is just forgotten in the film.The final untruth is of course about her death. The film forgets to tell us the captain of the trip to England and back to America was Argall, the captain who abducted her, and the film pretends she knew before going to London that Smith was not dead, and hence had lied to her and to the Powhatan alliance. That makes the death easy and the hypothesis of her being poisoned is nicely evacuated. At the same time what happens to her son is not that clear.The last element that is absolutely unacceptable is the music that has nothing to do with the historical period and the Indian context of many scenes. No Indian music and in England we have piano music as if the piano already existed in the early 16th century.So it is interesting to see the film because of its realism but it is highly un-historical if not anti-historical. Could have done better with a little help from simple historical research. Real history is just as entertaining as ideological biased story-telling.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Could have done a lot better.,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,4647,"['version', 'many', 'positive', 'points', 'indeed', 'one', 'Indians', 'are', 'real', 'Indians', 'two', 'Indian', 'life', 'style', 'lot', 'more', 'realistic', 'most', 'other', 'versions', 'what', 'films', 'more', 'credible', 'most', 'other', 'versions', 'highly', 'probably', 'Indians', 'were', 'lot', 'more', 'hostile', 'thought', 'as', 'soon', 'understood', 'English', 'were', 'going', 'planning', 'stay', 'thus', 'Smith', 'had', 'lied', 'promised', 'departure', 'knew', 'was', 'lie.The', 'other', 'side', 'just', 'realistic', 'English', 'die', 'flies', 'first', 'year', 'diseases', 'cold', 'hunger', 'also', 'Indians', 'vision', 'English', 'also', 'realistic', 'extreme', 'violence', 'were', 'confronted', 'extreme', 'violence', 'submitted', 'Indians', 'Indians', 'tried', 'overwhelm', 'numbers', 'English', 'just', 'burnt', 'villages', 'killed', 'everyone', 'burnt', 'harvests', 'crops', 'forcing', 'Indians', 'go', 'away', 'starve', 'being', 'exterminated', 'film', 'even', 'clear', 'intention', 'pushing', 'Indians', 'away', 'very', 'start.But', 'apart', 'realistic', 'dimension', 'film', 'story', 'embellished', 'love', 'story', 'little', 'do', 'what', 'probably', 'really', 'happened', 'Pocahontas', 'was', 'ten', 'when', 'Smith', 'appeared', 'not', 'grown', 'young', 'woman', 'religious', 'position', 'training', 'not', 'explicated', 'thus', 'Indian', 'culture', 'not', 'all', 'exploited', 'highly', 'spiritual', 'culture', 'reduced', 'kind', 'ritualistic', 'superstitious', 'extremely', 'primitive', 'behavior', 'relishing', 'paint', 'other', 'body', 'adornments', 'testimonies', 'show', 'clearly', 'Indian', 'civilization', 'was', 'highly', 'advanced', 'one', 'field', 'mental', 'spiritual', 'empathy', 'other', 'people', 'other', 'side', 'reality', 'supernatural', 'side', 'more', 'less', 'energetic', 'lead', 'worst', 'part', 'erasing', 'real', 'chronology', 'role', 'Argall', 'game', 'abduction', 'supposedly', 'coming', 'father', 'Pocahontas', 'had', 'banned', 'tribe', 'exile', 'tribe', 'Powhatan', 'alliance', 'Indian', 'husband', 'Pocahontas', 'had', 'Indian', 'son', 'abduction', 'killing', 'Indian', 'husband', 'escape', 'Indian', 'son', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'moved', 'relatives', 'when', 'Indians', 'realized', 'Pocahontas', 'was', 'being', 'fooled', 'abduction', 'also', 'more', 'less', 'abduction', 'easier', 'being', 'saved', 'exile', 'Captain', 'Smith.The', 'fable', 'Smith', 'being', 'saved', 'course', 'central', 'only', 'second', 'version', 'event', 'Smith', 'gave', '1624', 'two', 'years', 'bloody', 'upheaval', 'Indians', 'had', 'obvious', 'impact', 'whole', 'testimony', 'colony', 'up', '1622', 'first', 'account', '1608', 'nothing', 'life', 'being', 'menaced', 'being', 'saved', 'then', 'Pocahontas', 'love', 'affair', 'course', 'justified', 'marriage', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'hyper-unrealistic', 'abduction', 'was', 'raped', 'gave', 'birth', 'mixed-blood', 'son', 'being', 'married', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'son', 'strangely', 'enough', 'named', 'governor', 'Colony', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Dale', 'who', 'had', 'had', 'access', 'captivity', 'even', 'worse', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'secretary', 'colony', 'did', 'not', 'register', 'own', 'son', 'books', 'colony', 'showing', 'boy', 'was', 'not', 'son', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'registering', 'was', 'considered', 'non-entity', 'was', 'mixed-blood', 'revealing', 'basic', 'racism', 'English', 'Indians', 'clear', 'anti-Indian', 'policy', 'Church', 'England', 'just', 'forgotten', 'film.The', 'final', 'untruth', 'course', 'death', 'film', 'forgets', 'tell', 'captain', 'trip', 'England', 'back', 'America', 'was', 'Argall', 'captain', 'who', 'abducted', 'film', 'knew', 'before', 'going', 'London', 'Smith', 'was', 'not', 'dead', 'hence', 'had', 'lied', 'Powhatan', 'alliance', 'death', 'easy', 'hypothesis', 'being', 'poisoned', 'nicely', 'evacuated', 'same', 'time', 'what', 'son', 'not', 'clear.The', 'last', 'element', 'absolutely', 'unacceptable', 'music', 'nothing', 'do', 'historical', 'period', 'Indian', 'context', 'many', 'scenes', 'Indian', 'music', 'England', 'have', 'piano', 'music', 'piano', 'already', 'existed', 'early', '16th', 'century.So', 'interesting', 'see', 'film', 'realism', 'highly', 'un-historical', 'not', 'anti-historical', 'Could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'little', 'help', 'simple', 'historical', 'research', 'Real', 'history', 'just', 'as', 'entertaining', 'ideological', 'biased', 'story-telling.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

I also agree that this film had a misleading advertising campaign, including this BD, which shows two shots of Farrell wielding a sword to fight Powhatans. Pocahontas should have figured prominently on the cover and in the advertising, as this is mostly her story, as she symbolizes the indigenous peoples who embody the natural pre-colonized America, and in turn represent humanity living in harmony with nature.Smith and Rolfe are the other corners of the love triangle. Smith represents the conquering aspect of European empires and of humanity in general. Rolfe is probably the character we most readily relate to, as he ethically works within the realities he faces, prefiguring the modern citizen of the developed world. Malick crafts a moving picture poem, bringing us from our grade school knowledge of history to a heightened awareness of the amazing power of these events, what they represent, and how they set in motion the story of America.Video quality is excellent, a worthy transfer for a stunningly beautifully film. Audio quality is also very good but I found the internal monologue voice-overs difficult to hear sometimes. The one extra is an extensive making-of documentary from which Malick is curiously absent. It focuses mainly on how the filmmakers strove for cultural authenticity and historical accuracy.THE NEW WORLD stands with milestones in art cinema like BARAKA, KOYAANISQATSI, and 2001.

Like the slowly growing and mostly dying crops that did in the settlers of Jamestown, this movie dies because of malnutrition.  There's far too littleLast of the Mohicans, and far too many panoramic views of a cinematographer's concept of early American wilderness (beautifully rendered) and indigenous buttocks.  The romance between John Smith (Farrell) and Pocahontas (Kilcher) is slower than a Special Olympic hurdler, and far too many scenes pass without a spoken word or consequential sound.  Honestly, the dialogue in this film must have been amazingly easy to memorize for the cast, because most of the long stretches of speaking parts seem to be done as voiceovers off camera.  And Colin Farrell STILL managed to utter his lines like he had a mouth full of marbles.  Aggravating is not a strong enough word, and the rest of the cast - aside from Christian Bale - is filled up of ambiguous Indians and random serfs.I appreciate the attempt at an authentic recreation and the historical significance of the story, but Pocahontas, much like the makers of this movie, made multiple mistakes, like I did when I decided to watch this...but hindsight is 20/20, I guess.Simply put, this is a watch once kind of movie.

This is the story of the first settlers in the new world and their first colony, Jamestown.  Everyone who has had an American history class is familiar with the character of John Smith and Pocahontas, and how she saved his life from death at the hands of her tribe.  This movie is shot in a very typical Terrance Malick fashion, lots of sweeping long shots of someone walking though tall grass with their arms out stretched or water reflecting the suns light, lots of back lit shots and of course slow motion shots of people swimming under water.If you like the way Malick directs than this movie is rite up your alley.  He loves the symbolic shots, poetic voice over narrative while the score plays for the emotional effect while he shoots people and scenery in a very artistic fashion it's quite boring.  Like many other films of Malick's he has a lot to say and takes him very long to say it.  Malick tells a story with his camera, and rarely uses dialog to move the story.  He loves to shoot these shots that serve the mood of the film over images that help drive the narrative forward.Malick is deliberate with his camera movements and extremely fluid but never has the pace needed to keep someone like me interested in where the story is going. He'll be shooting a scene of someone walking somewhere, something that should be quick to get the viewer to the next scene but as he shoots he'll see some birds flying over head and into a sunset, he'll turn the camera to that and film that until the birds are far off the horizon. This get old real quick.  Artful done but losses its entertaining qualities after a while and by the end of the film you do not want to see the ending as much as you just want it to end.  The story has its interesting moments but it takes so long to get to them.  For a more patient film aficionado this might be right up your alley but for me, Someone who's not a fan of Malick's style of story telling it petered out somewhere in the middle and never got my full interest again.",2,Watching a beautiful piece of art being painted...and watching it dry.,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,2103,"['new', 'World', 'directed', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'Stars', 'Colin', 'Ferrell', 'Capt', 'John', 'Smith', 'story', 'first', 'settlers', 'new', 'world', 'first', 'colony', 'Jamestown', 'Everyone', 'who', 'had', 'American', 'history', 'class', 'familiar', 'character', 'John', 'Smith', 'Pocahontas', 'how', 'saved', 'life', 'death', 'hands', 'tribe', 'movie', 'shot', 'very', 'typical', 'Terrance', 'Malick', 'fashion', 'lots', 'sweeping', 'long', 'shots', 'someone', 'walking', 'tall', 'grass', 'arms', 'out', 'stretched', 'water', 'reflecting', 'suns', 'light', 'lots', 'back', 'lit', 'shots', 'course', 'slow', 'motion', 'shots', 'people', 'swimming', 'water.If', 'way', 'Malick', 'movie', 'rite', 'alley', 'symbolic', 'shots', 'poetic', 'voice', 'narrative', 'score', 'plays', 'emotional', 'effect', 'people', 'scenery', 'very', 'artistic', 'fashion', 'quite', 'boring', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Malick', 'lot', 'say', 'very', 'long', 'say', 'Malick', 'story', 'camera', 'rarely', 'dialog', 'move', 'story', 'shoot', 'shots', 'serve', 'mood', 'film', 'images', 'help', 'drive', 'narrative', 'forward.Malick', 'deliberate', 'camera', 'movements', 'extremely', 'fluid', 'never', 'pace', 'needed', 'keep', 'someone', 'interested', 'where', 'story', 'going', ""'ll"", 'be', 'shooting', 'scene', 'someone', 'walking', 'somewhere', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'quick', 'get', 'viewer', 'next', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'see', 'birds', 'flying', 'head', 'sunset', ""'ll"", 'turn', 'camera', 'film', 'birds', 'are', 'far', 'horizon', 'get', 'old', 'real', 'quick', 'Artful', 'done', 'losses', 'entertaining', 'qualities', 'while', 'end', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'ending', 'as', 'much', 'just', 'want', 'end', 'story', 'interesting', 'moments', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'more', 'patient', 'film', 'aficionado', 'might', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'Someone', 'who', 'not', 'fan', 'Malick', 'style', 'story', 'telling', 'petered', 'out', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'never', 'got', 'full', 'interest', 'again']",N/A

This movie has an interesting premise, it depicts the first settlement in English America that took hold, Jamestown.  That story is one of tragedy, perseverence, and ultimately triumph.  Along the way there was death, violence, and human drama, all of which Hollywood thrives upon.  But this movie is choppy with little continuity between scenes.  The actors do a good enough job to convey the story but they are in an endless morass of incomplete scenes and poorly edited material.John Smith and Pocahontas did much to assure the survival of the Jamestown colony.  Even so, by the end of the first full year the colonists were on the verge of giving up.  Had it not been for the relief ship's arrival, the colony may well have been abandoned.  Over time the tobacco culture gradually emerged to give the colony its life blood.  Here is where men like John Rolfe were essential.  But in the meantime, colonists died in droves because of the lack of survival skills and the lack of structure to the colony's governing system.  The gentlemen did not want to work, thinking such labor was beneath their status.  The laborers were sold on the notion that gold would be readily available so none were inclined to till the soil.All of these elements are true to the real Jamestown but are only superficially touched on in this film.  It is true that Pocahontas journied to London where she later died, but even this scene is treated with little emotion in the film.  The final scene has John Rolfe preparing to return to Virginia, again, with no emotion or determination to succeed inspite of his recent loss.

Simply put, people either love his films or they loathe them. For those of us who love symbolism, deeply meditative sequences of sound and imagery, or poetic cinematography, the New World will again act as an ample supply to fulfill your lust for films less ordinary.PLOT:This is the story of Pocahontas and John Smith portrayed in a style you've never seen before. Smith arrives in 17th century Jamestown upon a ship and is sentenced to die, but his sentence is revoked when Smith's importance to the survival of the new colony is acknowledged. He isn't safe from the surrounding ""naturals"", however, and soon finds himself on the verge of death again until young Pocahontas saves his life.The two quickly develop a platonic friendship in which they innocently teach one another words from each other's native tongue, and roam the landscape in type of otherworldly, cherubic flight of tranquility. Smith, feeding his constant wanderlust, eventually leaves Pocahontas, who at this point has been abandoned by her tribe for placing Smith above her people. She remains at the Anglo settlement and begins adopting their customs and culture. It is here that Pocahontas meets John Rolfe and eventually marries him, adopting the Anglo name of Rebecca. But the memory, and presence, of Smith are not completely evaporated and a final reunion seems imminent.The New World is just as much about the spiritual bond of family as it is the ideal relationship between Smith and Pocahontas. The young native woman at times questions where her dead mother has gone, and in the last hauntingly beautiful segment of the film, finally realizes that all of us live on in our children.There are a number of breathtaking scenes in which Malick intertwines natural beauty and a series of pensively symbolic imagery. Outside a battle scene towards the middle of the film, The New World is remarkably clean and lacks any type of romantic sensuality between Smith and Pocahontas.

And for something so incredibly visually stimulating, I prefer to savor it slowly...like a fine novel.  The score was also very nice too.I think the lack of dialogue was completely fitting given the language barrier between the two worlds.  It would have been ridiculous if the native girl was suddenly fluent in English after a couple months.  I did, however, agree that some of the courting scenes could have been cut a bit as they got a bit repetitive.  All in all, though, this is a very interesting movie, and I look forward to seeing Malick's other works.While most movie-goers want lots of bells and whistles (explosions, graphics, witty one liners, plot twists ad nauseum), I'm glad that there are still a few filmakers out there who cater to the rest of us who are a bit more focussed on the artistic side.  We may be the minority, but I'm glad to be part of the crowd that enjoys a 1,000 page opus, a 45 minute musical piece, or a film lke Mallick's.  Not every movie has to have the same balance of elements.  Simply put, you don't watch Mallick for the dialogue, and you don't watch Tarantino for enlightenment.  But that's not to say either is better than the other.  Alot of the negative reviews of Mallick's film (and most negative reviews in general) tend to be a case where the reviewer is upset that what unfolded on the screen before them didn't match their pre-conceived notions of what a film ""should"" be.  I've found that casting out those notions allows for enjoying a much broader range of art.  For example: I love dialogue in Scorsese, Tarantino-esque movies, and I could have very easily obsessed over the lack of dialogue in The New World, and it would have caused me to miss all the good stuff.My recommendation is that admittedly this movie isn't for everyone.  If you are the type of person who can sit by a lake in the High Sierras and marvel at the majestic beauty all around you, you will probably dig this film.  If going to the mall or playing paintball is more your thing, probably not.PS- I also really liked the points Mallick was trying to make with this film in regards to our endless pursuit of progress.

Christian Bale is John Rolf and Q'Orianka Kilcher portrays Pocahontas. There are so many good things about the film. The costumes are wonderful and the actors all looked their parts. The sanctimonious settlers, and the Indians, who were rightfully suspicious, both seemed very realist to me. The way the colony was set up and how it looked was intriguing too. The scenery looked raw, not too inviting, but beautiful.The down side of the movie was the dialogue between the characters. It was often so difficult to understand them that the viewer had to constantly second-guess a lot of what was being said. This was more than annoying, it took away from the story and the hard work of putting the film together. In the quest for realism, actors mumble out their words and the audio doesn't make accommodations for the timbre of the different voices.  I think it's essential to a good movie to have microphones closer to the actors so that their words can be heard.Oh, one more thing, I read a lot of history and I don't recall reading that John Smith and Pocahontas were in love.

975391,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000EOTTTU,Kaya Savas,"[242, 291]","MOVIE: Terrence Malick is not a mainstream director, his films while few in number, are incredibly rich with detail and visual language. Only a very few people can appreciate one of his films, mostly because they tend to run longer than mainstream movies and they don't follow the traditional formula. If you've seen The Thin Red Line then you know what a Terrence Malick film is. The Thin Red Line is in my opinion one of the finest cinematic accomplishmensts in the war genre. The New World is basically Malick's counterpart to The Thin Red Line. While The Thin Red Line was a look into the dark nature of mankind and how we destroy ourselves, The New World is the opposite of that. This film is about the celebration of the human spirit and the wonder of life. It is a truly poetic film that uses the story of John Smith and Pocahontas to express this commentary. The New World focuses on the clash of differences between two civilizations and how in the mess of differences two people are able to connect and see the beauty of each other. The movie moves slow though, and there are some parts where I found the editing to be a little confusing. Otherwise, I think the film is an incredible emotional journey filled with poetry and brilliant cinematic images. This film and The Thin Red Line are very similar in style. Malick even uses the same motif with birds as he does in The Thin Red Line. You also have the poetic narration of the main characters, and the narration itself can stand alone as poetry, it is truly remarkable. Beautiful landcapes captured brilliantly with the camera, long tracking shots, and many wide shots enhance the surrounding for the audience. He also uses his ""sun through the trees"" shot multiple times, which I personally loved in The Thin Red Line and even used it a couple times in my projects. All the shots are accompanied by James Horner's acceptable yet somewhat flawed score. In my opinion I thought the score sounded exactly like his work on The Perfect Storm. I was devestated when Hans Zimmer was detached from the project due to scheduling problems, because it was with The Thin Red Line that Zimmer composed his masterpiece. Horner does a good job in my opinion, but at times I felt like it was all too similar and sometimes lacking. The characters are all wonderfully expressed as well, and the change that Pocahontas goes through basically defines the film's central theme of change in surrounding while still retaining your individual personality. This film celebrates humanity and is his counterpart to The Thin Red Line, which basically shows the flaws of humanity. See both film if you have not already, and if you are new to Terrence Malick please have an open mind. This man is a wonderful filmmaker, I wish he wasn't so elusive and would actually do interviews as well do maybe more than 1 movie every decade. Then again, the fact that he has only directed 5 movies in his career since 1969 maybe is his greatest strength, and puts him on the list of top directors in the industry.ACTING: The film is almost absent of any structural dialogue. Dialogue between characters is rare and brief yet oh so meaningful, and then there is the poetic narration. The actors do a fine job with facial expressions and evoking the right emotions. Colin Farrell is great and plays a character who is in love with Pocahontas and embraces her world. Christian Bale does a fantastic job as the man who falls in love with Pocahontas yet tries to make part of English society. Then we have newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher who plays Pocahontas, and does an amazing job with the role. The acting is all emotion and hardly any dialogue.BOTTOM LINE: I talked to my parents after I saw the film, they said that people walked out of the movie at the showing they saw, which didn't suprise me at all.

However, I just didn't realize just how slow it would be for a movie that is a little over 2 hours long.English men land in Virginia and immediately form a ""relationship"" with the Naturals.  There's an interesting contrast of these two groups.  The Naturals are at ease compared to the English.  Of course, things go wrong when the English start to take over the land little by little.When Newton returns to English, things go from bad to worse in Virginia.  Smith is captured by the Naturals.  However, instead of killing him, they let him live among them...with the help of Pocahontas.  Of course, against the wish of the king, Pocahontas and Smith eventually fall in love.From here on to the end, the story gets a little odd.

975397,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000EOTTTU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 9]","It seems obvious what is meant by the title of ""The New World"" as soon as you find out Terrence Malick's film is about Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) and John Smith (Colin Farrell).  But there are additional layers of meaning to the term, because Malick is trying to evoke the moment of equilibrium where two cultures met and each was confronted with the strange newness of the other.  As always, Malick's vision is poetic, relying on images and music more than dialogue in his marriage of sight and sound.  Even in terms of the spoken word, the emphasis is more on narration than on conversation.  The approach might be frustrating to some viewers, because Malick does not tell his story using the conventions of contemporary cinema.  But then we have known for some time that Malick makes movies in his own world.  He just does not not invite us for visits as often as we would like.Judging this film in terms of historical accuracy is difficult, given what little we know about these characters.  It is believed that Pocahontas was born around 1595, which would have made her 12 in 1607 when she supposedly rescued John Smith from death when he was captured and brought to Werowocomoco.  Whether Smith's version of the story is true, is open to debate, as is the nature of exactly what he was being rescued from, but it is the meeting between them and how the Powhatan Confederacy supported the fledgling Jamestown colony.  The actress playing Pocahontas was fourteen when Malick was filming, which would made her a couple of years too old for the initial scenes with Smith, but then Kilcher also has to play ""Rebecca"" when she travels to England at approximately the age of twenty-two in 1617, ten years after she first met John Smith and a year before she died in the new world she found on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.The character is never called Pocahontas in the film, and indeed the daughter of Powhatan (whose named was really Wahusunacock) was named Matoaka, with ""Pocahontas"" being a childhood nickname referring to her frolicing nature.  The idea of a romance between Pocahontas and Smith is studiously avoided, since she ends up marrying another Englishman, John Rolfe (Christian Bale).  Her assimilation is the focal point of the film and there is a sense in which Malick is telling the familiar story of the stranger in a strange land who goes native.  In other words, this is the opposite of what we saw in ""A Man Called Horse"" and ""Dances With Wolves,"" because it is the Native American, the ""natural,"" who is captivated by the alien culture.  But notice that this reversal takes place at a time when the ""Indian princess"" would be welcomed at the court of the king and queen of England.  The fate of the woman we know as Pocahontas is relatively unique in our cultural history, especially with the horror stories to come regarding the fates of other Native Americans.  That is why Malick's movie presents a vision of a brief moment in American history that was pretty much gone as soon as she passed away.",5,Terrence Malick's vision of when two worlds collide,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,3034,"['obvious', 'what', 'meant', 'title', 'New', 'World', 'as', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'film', 'Pocahontas', ""Q'Orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'John', 'Smith', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'are', 'additional', 'layers', 'meaning', 'term', 'Malick', 'trying', 'evoke', 'moment', 'equilibrium', 'where', 'two', 'cultures', 'met', 'was', 'confronted', 'strange', 'newness', 'other', 'always', 'Malick', 'vision', 'poetic', 'relying', 'images', 'music', 'more', 'dialogue', 'marriage', 'sight', 'sound', 'Even', 'terms', 'spoken', 'word', 'emphasis', 'more', 'narration', 'conversation', 'approach', 'might', 'be', 'frustrating', 'viewers', 'Malick', 'not', 'tell', 'story', 'using', 'conventions', 'contemporary', 'cinema', 'then', 'have', 'known', 'time', 'Malick', 'movies', 'own', 'world', 'just', 'not', 'not', 'invite', 'visits', 'as', 'often', 'would', 'like.Judging', 'film', 'terms', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'difficult', 'given', 'what', 'little', 'know', 'characters', 'believed', 'Pocahontas', 'was', 'born', '1595', 'would', 'have', 'made', '12', '1607', 'when', 'supposedly', 'rescued', 'John', 'Smith', 'death', 'when', 'was', 'captured', 'brought', 'Werowocomoco', 'Whether', 'Smith', 'version', 'story', 'true', 'open', 'debate', 'nature', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'rescued', 'meeting', 'how', 'Powhatan', 'Confederacy', 'supported', 'fledgling', 'Jamestown', 'colony', 'actress', 'playing', 'Pocahontas', 'was', 'fourteen', 'when', 'Malick', 'was', 'filming', 'would', 'made', 'couple', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'initial', 'scenes', 'Smith', 'then', 'Kilcher', 'also', 'play', 'Rebecca', 'when', 'England', 'approximately', 'age', 'twenty-two', '1617', 'ten', 'years', 'first', 'met', 'John', 'Smith', 'year', 'died', 'new', 'world', 'found', 'other', 'side', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean.The', 'character', 'never', 'called', 'Pocahontas', 'film', 'indeed', 'daughter', 'Powhatan', 'named', 'was', 'really', 'Wahusunacock', 'was', 'named', 'Matoaka', 'Pocahontas', 'being', 'childhood', 'nickname', 'referring', 'frolicing', 'nature', 'idea', 'romance', 'Pocahontas', 'Smith', 'studiously', 'avoided', 'up', 'marrying', 'Englishman', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'assimilation', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'sense', 'Malick', 'telling', 'familiar', 'story', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'who', 'native', 'other', 'words', 'opposite', 'what', 'saw', 'A', 'Man', 'Called', 'Horse', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Native', 'American', 'natural', 'who', 'captivated', 'alien', 'culture', 'notice', 'reversal', 'place', 'time', 'when', 'Indian', 'princess', 'would', 'be', 'welcomed', 'court', 'king', 'queen', 'England', 'fate', 'woman', 'know', 'Pocahontas', 'relatively', 'unique', 'cultural', 'history', 'especially', 'horror', 'stories', 'come', 'regarding', 'fates', 'other', 'Native', 'Americans', 'why', 'Malick', 'movie', 'vision', 'brief', 'moment', 'American', 'history', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'gone', 'as', 'soon', 'passed', 'away']",N/A

975400,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000EOTTTU,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 8]","This 2005 film tells the story of Captain John Smith who came to America in the 16th Century and the curiosity and conflict between the Indians and the settlers. That's a familiar theme and this film does it well.  Colin Farrell is cast as Smith.  He's portrayed as a dashing and handsome bad boy adventurer.  Naturally he and the Indian have problems with each other and the Indians want to kill him.  It is the Chief's daughter who saves his life and she is then cast out of her tribe.  This is the legendary Pocahontas although that name is never used in the film.  This part is played by 14-year old Q'orianka Kilcher.  She is the daughter of a South American Indian father and a Caucasian Swiss mother and grew up in Germany.  She is indeed very pretty but she really doesn't look like the Native Americans we see around today.  Again, Hollywood casting wants to cast mixed race beauties because they think it will sell more films.Naturally there are hints of a love affair between the Indian maiden and the Captain, especially now that she is forced to live in the English settlement and learn English ways.  She has to wear a corset and tight shoes and learn to read the bible.  However, she takes it all in stride because she loves the Captain.  However, he leaves for another adventure and tells everyone to tell her he is dead.  She mourns for a long time but eventually is romanced by a young widower played by Christopher Bale.  They marry, have children and seem very happy.  Years pass.  Then this couple and their children are invited to England where it is inevitable that they meet up with Captain John Smith again.This is not a film for history buffs.

Following the same mise en scene of Badlands, Days of Heaven, and The Thin Red Line (basically, all of his movies to date), 2006's The New World represents a monumental achievement for Malick & Co., and draws us into yet another iteration of his resplendent, obsessively paced, cinematographic universe. Starring an impeccably cast Colin Farrell (yes, Colin Farrell; he is talented, deal with it) and newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher, The New World takes the story of the Jamestown settlement, Captain John Smith, Pocahontas, et al., and turns it into a visual tone poem. As with most of his movies (three out of four), Malick both wrote and directed The New World and laces the dreamy naturescapes with his trademark stream-of-consciousness dialogue, giving the impression that the characters don't exactly talk to each other; rather, the spoken words work in concert, comingling at times, but never out of any obligatory sense of call-and-response. It's also important to notice the contrast between the relative peace of nature and the violence of human beings, as Malick gives equal screen time to the birds, trees, fields, and water, as he does the actors, set pieces, and war scenes. Although this theme appears in each of his films, nowhere is it more pronounced than The New World. It would be fair to say that Malick's pictures, each in their own way, preoccupy themselves with this idea, but no other filmmaker (with the possible exception of Herzog) addresses it with as much passion, &eacute;lan, and commitment.

So intones John Smith (an emphatic and forceful Colin Farrell) describing his time with Pocahontas (a gorgeous newcomer, Q'Orianka Kilcher) in what would come to be known as Jamestown, Virginia circa 1607.And so much like a dream is Terence Malick's newest ""The New World."" There are long stretches of this film in which there is only action without or with minimal sound:  the Native Americans going about their day-to-day lives, working, playing, training, eating and celebrating while the King James sent Englishmen, looking for a quick way from England to the ""Indies,"" basically go about their day scavenging for food, fighting amongst themselves and acting like savages. In fact, the Native Americans are mostly gorgeous, clean, well groomed while the supposedly civilized Englishmen are smelly, scuffy and ill-mannered. One of the funniest scenes comes at the beginning of the film when a Warrior approaches Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) and squinches his nose due to the Captain's body odor. There is no doubt that the peaceful, though wary and intelligent Natives as presented here: regal, civilized are superior to the intruders.In a mesmerizing almost stuperous mist, in a land so new and fresh and rife with possibilities, where a man can begin again without the sins of his past encroaching upon and stifling him, Malick sets the scene for the beginning of ""The New World."" There is such wonder, giddiness and hope in Malick's mise en scene that you can't help but be taken in by it all: what a chance we had to build a better world, what a chance we had to right the wrongs of our former world.The central story is the one between Princess Pocahontas (""playful one"") and Captain John Smith who arrives in Jamestown in shackles and is almost hung for treason but Captain Newport thinks better of it and instead sends Smith on a journey up the river to find and pay respects to Chief Powhatan. Powhatan instructs Smith to teach Pocahontas English and from this a romance develops.Malick takes his time telling this story and ""The New World"" is slow, quiet, often silent and elegiac: he takes the time to stop, observe and ponder what his camera is showing...no quick jump cuts here to keep us supposedly impatient viewers interested. The world of Malick's films is a world filled with innocence and wonder: but wonder and innocence tempered with the realities of the brutal and the unforgiving. We are in Paradise here, Paradise before the fall: the fall is inevitable, of course and there is no doubt on whose doorstep the fault can be laid.",5,Dreams,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2587,"['dream', 'intones', 'John', 'Smith', 'emphatic', 'forceful', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'describing', 'time', 'Pocahontas', 'gorgeous', 'newcomer', ""Q'Orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'what', 'would', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'Jamestown', 'Virginia', 'circa', '1607.And', 'so', 'much', 'dream', 'Terence', 'Malick', 'newest', 'New', 'World', 'are', 'long', 'stretches', 'film', 'only', 'action', 'minimal', 'sound', 'Native', 'Americans', 'going', 'day-to-day', 'lives', 'working', 'playing', 'training', 'eating', 'celebrating', 'King', 'James', 'sent', 'Englishmen', 'looking', 'quick', 'way', 'England', 'Indies', 'basically', 'go', 'day', 'scavenging', 'food', 'fighting', 'amongst', 'acting', 'savages', 'fact', 'Native', 'Americans', 'are', 'mostly', 'gorgeous', 'clean', 'well', 'groomed', 'supposedly', 'civilized', 'Englishmen', 'are', 'smelly', 'scuffy', 'ill-mannered', 'One', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'film', 'when', 'Warrior', 'approaches', 'Captain', 'Newport', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'nose', 'due', 'Captain', 'body', 'odor', 'doubt', 'peaceful', 'wary', 'intelligent', 'Natives', 'presented', 'here', 'regal', 'civilized', 'are', 'superior', 'intruders.In', 'mesmerizing', 'almost', 'stuperous', 'mist', 'land', 'so', 'new', 'fresh', 'rife', 'possibilities', 'where', 'man', 'can', 'begin', 'again', 'sins', 'past', 'encroaching', 'upon', 'stifling', 'Malick', 'scene', 'beginning', 'New', 'World', 'such', 'wonder', 'giddiness', 'hope', 'Malick', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'taken', 'what', 'chance', 'had', 'build', 'better', 'world', 'what', 'chance', 'had', 'right', 'wrongs', 'former', 'world.The', 'central', 'story', 'one', 'Princess', 'Pocahontas', 'playful', 'one', 'Captain', 'John', 'Smith', 'who', 'Jamestown', 'shackles', 'almost', 'hung', 'treason', 'Captain', 'Newport', 'better', 'instead', 'sends', 'Smith', 'journey', 'river', 'find', 'pay', 'respects', 'Chief', 'Powhatan', 'Powhatan', 'Smith', 'teach', 'Pocahontas', 'English', 'romance', 'develops.Malick', 'time', 'telling', 'story', 'New', 'World', 'slow', 'quiet', 'often', 'silent', 'elegiac', 'time', 'stop', 'observe', 'ponder', 'what', 'camera', 'showing', 'quick', 'jump', 'cuts', 'here', 'keep', 'supposedly', 'impatient', 'viewers', 'interested', 'world', 'Malick', 'films', 'world', 'filled', 'innocence', 'wonder', 'wonder', 'innocence', 'tempered', 'realities', 'brutal', 'unforgiving', 'are', 'Paradise', 'here', 'Paradise', 'fall', 'fall', 'inevitable', 'course', 'doubt', 'doorstep', 'fault', 'can', 'be', 'laid']",N/A

What a beautiful love story and I'm SICK AND TIRED of people claiming that this may or may not have happened, BUT WERE YOU THERE 400 YEARS AGO? NO. So I really don't care, if you were an indian girl and if you were old enough to be married, you could do whatever you want. And rarely did a young girl marry someone her own age, so that part is correct. In Hispanic culture's if the women reaches age 15, she can be married and have children. Alot of people don't understand this, but oh well.The chemistry in this film was astonishing and almost poetic, this was a timeless love story. Infact I think this was the story that inspired Hollywood romances. ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Titanic"", these are romances that have to people who fall in love during a series of tragic events. This film is about a women who basically betrays her own people to be with the man she loves and when it backfires, it is unbelievable and it's some of the best acting I'v ever seen. She is not a traitor but a stupid young women who was in love, and Colin Farrell is astonishing as John Smith, he shows vulnerability in his acting and sadness and sometimes happiness. He reminds me of Mel Gibson in his prime(think Braveheart and you'll understand).Love makes us do stupid things and this is no surprise and the brilliant scenes that Terrence Malick decided to show is of course between O'Rianka Kilcher and Colin Farrell. Some people say they were more like Brother and Sister instead of lovers and that maybe true, cause Malick makes it seem that was at first and then they would start acting like a couple and it is SO sweet and Beautiful. Colin Farrell would treat her like a little girl(which she was) and then he would treat her like a women(which she was as well). Christian Bale is almost perfection in this and I thought he was great in ""Batman Begins"" and ""American Phyco"", but this is on another level, he can do no wrong at this point in his career. Some people say alot of this didn't happen, but then again people also say that Jesus wasn't beaten the way he was in ""Passion of the Christ."" Were you there? No.So I do my own reserch and John Smith say's nothing but love in his diary but that's all I know. And everybody needs to see this film before they start making up their own opinions and start making racial comments. So all I'v got to say is this is the greatest historical romance sense either ""Titanic"" or ""Gone with The Wind"" and the best film of the year and this is probably Terrence Malick's best work. I hope he stays the way he is and only makes a masterpiece every 10 or 20 years.

Coupled with the musical score, this was some of the best camera work I have seen in a long time. This was, in my opinion, the sole redeeming feature of the film.While the filme attempted to contemplate serious and deep issues of love, allegiance and so on, it succeeded in only boring the tears out this viewer with the monotonous monologues of the characters done as long lengths of naration. In one part, the plot lost some continuity and needed reviewing to get to grips with what had happened.For actors of the calibre of Colin Farrell and Christian Bale, this film did not show them at their best. Certainly not the worst I have seen by any stretch, but definitely not the best I have seen from either one of these actors.Tread with caution on this one, and hire it before you buy it.

The film could've been a silent movie because of the total lack of dialogue.  Most the dialogue that is in the film is either mumbled or they are thoughts murmered by the characters.  I think the term incoherrent comes to mind when I think of this film, because it is really just a jumble of images, whispering dialogue, and eerie piano music.For example, early in the film the colonists discover their barrels of food have worms in it, only to cut to a scene where a guy is standing in a field and somebody says ""cut his ears off"", then to change scenes of a Native getting shot by a pistol, then to switch over to Farrell wandering around in the tall grass.  Anybody who considers this coherrent film-editing is a nutcase because this is truly poor storytelling.  You can't just throw a bunch of images around without having them connected by something.

Newton,"[16, 35]","Now is it me or is that since Colin Farrell has made it big in Hollywood his film appearances have become become correspondingly more dire? So this film ""The New World"" - the basic story is Colin Farrell is this English soldier/ adventurer sails to the New World (present USA) and becomes entranced with Native American life, falls in love with Pocahontas, he is forced to go off somewhere against his will, she re-marries another Englishman, goes to England and dies.Ok well I know more about the true story than this simplistc trite. John Smith (the Colin Farrell character) was a mercenray who did not fall in love with Pocahontas (real name Matoaka who was only 10 years old at the time) or the Native American way of life. He was a ruthless if effective soldier who kept the English Colony from starving during its initial years by looting (and sometimes burning) Native American towns at gunpoint for their winter stores of dried meat and harvested crops.There were just so many things wrong with this film. The Native Americans are seen as hooting and gibbering and hopping around trees like monkeys - in short they are the proverbial 'noble savages' devoid of concepts of sin etc ..... yawn, yawn, yawn ....... etc. The Pocahontas character apart from the obvious issue of her age is decked out in some figure hugging two piece that looks more akin to something Raquel Welch wore in ""One million BC"" - it had no practical purpose at all and bore no resemblance to any Native American costume of that or indeed any period. It did seem to perhaps though fulfil the requirements of certain adolescent male fantasies about the innocent, yet sexually well informed (and behavioural) exotic native woman. Someone please explain how you can marry these two contradictory 'ideals'? Then there was the music and imagery which reminded me of those TV adverts for 'Impulse' body spray in the mid-1980's. All allure and vaguely ethereal - I was just waiting for someone to say ""Lulu?"" and Lisette Anthony (from 'Three Up, Two Down' fame - starring Michael Elphick) to appear and reply ""Oui, c'est moi"". I of course was a fan of the advert for 'Limara' body spray, because that was far more rocky.

I didn't realize that there would be very little dialogue and when there was, I had a hard time understanding it due to the strong accents. From what I could see, this director wanted audiences to see just how beautiful nature is. The movie was filmed so beautifully. The actors did a wonderful job but it's Pocahontas, actress Q'Orianka Kilcher that stole the movie! She was amazing! You could feel every feeling that she was feeling. She was phenomenal! There didn't need to be dialogue when watching her and John Smith (Colin Farrell) getting to know each other and then falling in love. First loves, very powerful! You could also feel the same between her and John Rolfe (Christian Bale). You could feel that her spirit had been broken and that John Rolfe understood that.  I hope that this is just the beginning of an amazing career for her.The only thing I did not care for in the movie was the musical score. Didn't move me at all. If anything, I found it to be very irritating. I noticed that you never even heard anyone say her name in the movie. Although I think her brother called her Pocah once.From what I understood, this movie was suppose to be about the legendary John Smith. That is not the case.

So when I discovered this new edition, I bit, and bought it. 'The New World - the Extended Cut' is the version that should have been. The new cut correctly places the focus of the film on the unnamed Pocahantas. The result is a totally different perspective in an already hauntingly beautiful and poetic film. Malick's films are not for everyone and I discovered that like poetry, the film is better absorbed in small doses.

975451,A3KPFUHI5VLHUM,B000EOTTTU,Paul,"[10, 14]","In what could be deemed ""mystic"" movie making, Terrence Malick, with The New World, carries on his tradition of exploring philosophy via cinema.As many have mentioned, and I think with good cause, the story itself is poetic and will thus appeal to different people in different ways depending on their worldviews.  Yet, the themes presented in the movie are broad enough to touch upon here.  The themes the movie offers are: discovery, love, innocence, life, death, drama, and peace.If you've seen the Thin Red Line, Malick employs a similar artistic style to capture the various emotional themes that are investigated throughout the film.  Regarding technique, Malick decides to order the plot sequences according to their associated weather patterns or seasons.  Thus, the movie begins in a summertime atmosphere, which is suppose to give the viewer the sense of discovery and love that John Smith finds when first arriving in Virginia.  It isn't surprising then that he and Pocahontas fall in love during this portion of the film, and their relationship seems unrealistically happy with an absence of conflicts to prevent its rapid maturity.As John Smith is sent back to Jamestown, the weather starts to turn as the storms roll in, indicating a storm in his relationship with Pocahontas.  The storm ends up being strong enough to present the main drama in the movie - John Smith is unable to take the risk needed to continue his relationship with Pocahontas. Pocahontas represents a dream of happiness for John Smith, a happiness that he truly desires, yet a happiness that he deems himself unworthy to receive; and thus, he decides to fold his deck rather than envelope himself in her love.  For her part, Pocahontas experiences for the first time in her life feelings of betrayal and insecurity.  The demise of her relationship with John is compared to a thorn being removed from her, or a dead branch being pruned away from a tree. It can also be viewed in terms of the winter weather, as John's heart grows cold towards her, freezing her heart to the world she used to cherish so much.  The result being that Pocahontas tastes death and needs someone to bring her back from its bonds.Here the story picks up some pace as John Rolfe enters stage right.  John is played by Christian Bale, who is an extraordinary actor and person, both of which clearly shine through his character in this film.  As a male likeness to Pocahontas' character, John offers hope to a woman with none and eventually takes Pocahontas for his wife.  John Rolfe's love, maturity, peace, and depth are a cannon being fired in the movie. In fact, his character may only appear for a quarter of the film, much shorter a time than John Smith for instance, but the impression he leaves is surprisingly larger!  John Rolfe and Pocahontas eventually find real love and build a true home in one another as they give birth to a child and create a family.  The child becomes a source of joy in the film, and Malick's intimate style presents the child as a sign of love, beauty, life, and ultimately of God's presence in a world that can sometimes seem unbearable.  In the end, John Rolfe's loving care for Pocahontas helps her to break loose from the weeds that had entangled her, as she matures into a full grown tree, peaceful, lasting, and magnificent!As the main character, Pocahontas' child like quality and loving ways are as appealing as the natural scenery shown throughout the film (which is extremely beautiful!).  In fact, discovering the new world, with its distant horizons, unseen territory, vast beauty, and spring of hope for a future humanity, is very much a parallel storyline to John ""discovering"" Pocahontas - she is a personification of America in her natural state.  This parallel plot allows Malick to take the film beyond a surface level description of the historical events, into a philosophical presentation.As a historical movie dealing with the Indian people, Malick shows concern and sensitivity towards the natives by presenting them as accurately as possible.  And, I would venture to say that he captures the essence of this people.  Their naturalness along with Pocahontas' innocence is captivating and certainly goes beyond even a lively imagination of the 17th Century Indians in Virginia or elsewhere.  Personally, I couldn't help but feel drawn towards the Indians cohesion with their natural environment and deep awareness of everything around them, not the least including God - referenced often throughout the movie as ""Mother"" by Pocahontas.  And I would say that watching this movie is like touching God: in the Indian people, in the English character of John Rolfe, in the cinematography, and most especially in Pocahontas.Cheers to a wonderful movie, and another Malick classic!",5,Malick's vision is a deep river,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,4792,"['what', 'could', 'be', 'deemed', 'mystic', 'movie', 'making', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'New', 'World', 'tradition', 'exploring', 'philosophy', 'cinema.As', 'many', 'have', 'mentioned', 'think', 'good', 'cause', 'story', 'poetic', 'will', 'thus', 'appeal', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'ways', 'depending', 'worldviews', 'themes', 'presented', 'movie', 'are', 'broad', 'enough', 'touch', 'here', 'themes', 'movie', 'offers', 'are', 'discovery', 'love', 'innocence', 'life', 'death', 'drama', 'peace.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'Malick', 'similar', 'artistic', 'style', 'capture', 'various', 'emotional', 'themes', 'are', 'investigated', 'film', 'Regarding', 'technique', 'Malick', 'order', 'plot', 'sequences', 'according', 'associated', 'weather', 'patterns', 'seasons', 'Thus', 'movie', 'summertime', 'atmosphere', 'suppose', 'give', 'viewer', 'sense', 'discovery', 'love', 'John', 'Smith', 'when', 'first', 'arriving', 'Virginia', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'then', 'Pocahontas', 'fall', 'love', 'portion', 'film', 'relationship', 'unrealistically', 'happy', 'absence', 'conflicts', 'prevent', 'rapid', 'maturity.As', 'John', 'Smith', 'sent', 'back', 'Jamestown', 'weather', 'turn', 'storms', 'roll', 'indicating', 'storm', 'relationship', 'Pocahontas', 'storm', 'up', 'being', 'strong', 'enough', 'present', 'main', 'drama', 'movie', 'John', 'Smith', 'unable', 'take', 'risk', 'needed', 'continue', 'relationship', 'Pocahontas', 'Pocahontas', 'dream', 'happiness', 'John', 'Smith', 'happiness', 'truly', 'yet', 'happiness', 'unworthy', 'receive', 'thus', 'fold', 'deck', 'rather', 'envelope', 'love', 'part', 'Pocahontas', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'feelings', 'betrayal', 'insecurity', 'demise', 'relationship', 'John', 'compared', 'thorn', 'being', 'removed', 'dead', 'branch', 'being', 'pruned', 'away', 'tree', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'viewed', 'terms', 'winter', 'weather', 'John', 'heart', 'cold', 'freezing', 'heart', 'world', 'used', 'cherish', 'so', 'much', 'result', 'being', 'Pocahontas', 'death', 'someone', 'bring', 'back', 'story', 'up', 'pace', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'enters', 'stage', 'right', 'John', 'played', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'who', 'extraordinary', 'actor', 'person', 'clearly', 'shine', 'character', 'film', 'male', 'likeness', 'Pocahontas', 'character', 'John', 'hope', 'woman', 'none', 'eventually', 'Pocahontas', 'wife', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'love', 'maturity', 'peace', 'depth', 'are', 'cannon', 'being', 'fired', 'movie', 'fact', 'character', 'may', 'only', 'appear', 'quarter', 'film', 'much', 'shorter', 'time', 'John', 'Smith', 'instance', 'impression', 'surprisingly', 'larger', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'Pocahontas', 'eventually', 'find', 'real', 'love', 'build', 'true', 'home', 'one', 'give', 'birth', 'child', 'create', 'family', 'child', 'source', 'joy', 'film', 'Malick', 'intimate', 'style', 'child', 'sign', 'love', 'beauty', 'life', 'ultimately', 'God', 'presence', 'world', 'can', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'unbearable', 'end', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'loving', 'care', 'Pocahontas', 'break', 'loose', 'weeds', 'had', 'entangled', 'her', 'full', 'grown', 'tree', 'peaceful', 'lasting', 'magnificent', 'main', 'character', 'Pocahontas', 'child', 'quality', 'loving', 'ways', 'are', 'as', 'appealing', 'natural', 'scenery', 'shown', 'film', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'fact', 'discovering', 'new', 'world', 'distant', 'horizons', 'unseen', 'territory', 'vast', 'beauty', 'spring', 'hope', 'future', 'humanity', 'very', 'much', 'parallel', 'storyline', 'John', 'discovering', 'Pocahontas', 'personification', 'America', 'natural', 'state', 'parallel', 'plot', 'Malick', 'take', 'film', 'surface', 'level', 'description', 'historical', 'events', 'philosophical', 'presentation.As', 'historical', 'movie', 'dealing', 'Indian', 'people', 'Malick', 'concern', 'sensitivity', 'towards', 'natives', 'presenting', 'as', 'accurately', 'possible', 'would', 'venture', 'say', 'essence', 'people', 'naturalness', 'Pocahontas', 'innocence', 'captivating', 'certainly', 'even', 'lively', 'imagination', '17th', 'Century', 'Indians', 'Virginia', 'elsewhere', 'Personally', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'drawn', 'Indians', 'cohesion', 'natural', 'environment', 'deep', 'awareness', 'everything', 'not', 'least', 'including', 'God', 'referenced', 'often', 'movie', 'Mother', 'Pocahontas', 'would', 'say', 'watching', 'movie', 'touching', 'God', 'Indian', 'people', 'English', 'character', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'cinematography', 'most', 'especially', 'Pocahontas.Cheers', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Malick', 'classic']",N/A

I also enjoyed seeing how the recreated the colony itself, and showed how miserable it was- rather than the romanticized version I learned in school.My criticism is that there was not much excitement, the drama was OK and passion was seriously lacking.

However even basic research will reveal that this retelling is as fictional and fallible as Disney's more famous counterpart. For example Smith's relationship with Rebecca/Pocahontas has never been proven to be romantic in nature, which is a central tenet of both Disney's and Malick's.The film, it must be said, is however beautiful. This is an example of poetic cinema at its best. While not as morally stimulating as 'The Thin Red Line', the film is nethertheless an interesting meditation on love - both for an individual and for idealistic concepts such as nation and belonging.Where it fails is in a contradiction between a desire to elevate the primitive (shared with 'The Thin Red Line') and a Westernised misinterpretation of Native American concepts. Smith comments that the 'natives' have no concept of ownership, and yet minutes later they deliver lines to the effect of 'the white people are stealing our land'. This appears to be a classic example of a western-centric viewpoint imposed on native values which is at odds, it feels, with Malicks' intentions.However if you can get past this contradiction, the film is a stimulating example of 'great' American cinema.

I loved 'Thin Red Line', whose meditative mode  and range of characters were compelling. This is a curious bit of retelling at this stage of his career, methinks. Those who deem the telling as sluggish are right on the money. I saw this in Tunis, in French, which I dont speak. That granted, I doubt I missed any subtelties. The cast looked a little too movie box for comfort, especially since so much attention had been given to the sets. The guy has a sweet way with the camera, but has brought nothing enlightening to the information. The problem with Malik's work is the gap in psychological frisson in the actors. Other commentators have remarked about this in their own ways. There is no 'inner' dynamism issuing from the leading actors. For all the breathless applause for his sweeping camera, and nature study (sometimes attempting an American version of the incomparable poetry of Tarkovsky)Malik is reaching and falling short of telling us something about intercultural oddities, shortcomings, frictions, whatever.

Lozano ""texasmountains""","[18, 39]","In connection with the previous reviewer touting a history degree from Harvard, I confess that I purport no such credentials, though I do hold a graduate degree in the humanities and consider myself to be reasonably well-read.  Rather, I am an amateur student of history, and something of a multi-genre movie buff.  Quite honestly, compared to this movie, ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Night of the Leapus"" each richly deserve a Palm d'Or at Cannes.  Having anxiously awaited this film's release since the initial teasers were shown in July & August, I surprised myself by my self-control in not walking out during this movie.  Christian Bale and Christopher Plummer were notably wonderful as always and as expected.  The newly introduced and quite lovely young actress who plays the heroine (I will not conjecture at her name as it has been already oft-discussed in these reviews) does an amazing job of convincingly portraying a wide range of ages and degrees of human experience within the two and a half hours playing time.Unfortunately, during those same 2.5 hours (which seemed to drag on practially forever), the proud Native Americans were made to be reduced to the level of children, portrayed as naive even unto idiocy, perhaps to drive home the point of the ""Eden"" desptroyed by the Jamestown settlers, but actually to a level that should be insulting to Native viewers as well as those with any modicum of understanding of and/or respect for their culture.Essentially, this was an extended Walgreens commercial, calling all viewers to the shores of their conceptualized town of ""Perfect.""  In attempting to present the viewer with overwhelming views and sensual experience the director/ producers instead succeed in flashing cinematography to affect those susceptible to mild epilepsy and a score that while powerful, overcomes and drowns out the visuals it was meant to accompany.  The introspective diary-style dialogue was an effective medium about a third of the time but began to grate at about the third plea to Farrell's ""inner demons"" and the heroine's ""Earth Mother.""As noted in another review, the historical accuracy is indeed accurate, or at least as accurate as Hollywood can be expected to manage.  Powhatan's cloak is a reproduction of a remnant with the same deer design in cowry-like shells, and the language seems to be an effective attempt at period dialect, both English and Native, though the Elizabethan Englishmen slip into a bit more of a modern cockney/ brogue that didn't exist then, and some of the Native actors show that they're clearly more comfortable with their native Spanish and Ojibway than the Powhatan dialect they attempt for the film.  One small though notable historical goof appears on the globe in Smith's new ""office"" - the globe shows a land mass demarked as ""China,"" which is curious because at that time it was still popularly known by the Dutch and English sailors as ""Cathay.""All in all, this was a visually stunning though horrifically boring film that it is my sincere hope that history students of the future and certainly casual viewers, will not be subjected to.",1,Quite Possibly the Worst Film of the Year,1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,3120,"['connection', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'touting', 'history', 'degree', 'Harvard', 'confess', 'purport', 'such', 'credentials', 'do', 'hold', 'graduate', 'degree', 'humanities', 'consider', 'be', 'reasonably', 'well-read', 'Rather', 'am', 'amateur', 'student', 'history', 'something', 'multi-genre', 'movie', 'buff', 'Quite', 'honestly', 'compared', 'movie', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Night', 'Leapus', 'richly', 'deserve', 'Palm', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes', 'Having', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'film', 'release', 'initial', 'teasers', 'were', 'shown', 'July', 'August', 'surprised', 'self-control', 'not', 'walking', 'out', 'movie', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'were', 'notably', 'wonderful', 'always', 'expected', 'newly', 'introduced', 'quite', 'lovely', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'heroine', 'will', 'not', 'conjecture', 'name', 'been', 'already', 'oft-discussed', 'reviews', 'amazing', 'job', 'convincingly', 'portraying', 'wide', 'range', 'ages', 'degrees', 'human', 'experience', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'playing', 'time.Unfortunately', 'same', '2.5', 'hours', 'seemed', 'drag', 'practially', 'forever', 'proud', 'Native', 'Americans', 'were', 'made', 'be', 'reduced', 'level', 'children', 'portrayed', 'naive', 'even', 'unto', 'idiocy', 'perhaps', 'drive', 'home', 'point', 'Eden', 'desptroyed', 'Jamestown', 'settlers', 'actually', 'level', 'should', 'be', 'insulting', 'Native', 'viewers', 'as', 'well', 'modicum', 'understanding', 'and/or', 'respect', 'culture.Essentially', 'was', 'extended', 'Walgreens', 'commercial', 'calling', 'viewers', 'shores', 'conceptualized', 'town', 'Perfect', 'attempting', 'present', 'viewer', 'overwhelming', 'views', 'sensual', 'experience', 'director/', 'producers', 'instead', 'succeed', 'flashing', 'cinematography', 'affect', 'susceptible', 'mild', 'epilepsy', 'score', 'powerful', 'overcomes', 'drowns', 'out', 'visuals', 'was', 'meant', 'accompany', 'introspective', 'diary-style', 'dialogue', 'was', 'effective', 'medium', 'third', 'time', 'began', 'grate', 'third', 'plea', 'Farrell', 'inner', 'demons', 'heroine', 'Earth', 'Mother', 'noted', 'review', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'indeed', 'accurate', 'least', 'as', 'accurate', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'manage', 'Powhatan', 'cloak', 'reproduction', 'remnant', 'same', 'deer', 'design', 'cowry-like', 'shells', 'language', 'be', 'effective', 'attempt', 'period', 'dialect', 'English', 'Native', 'Elizabethan', 'Englishmen', 'slip', 'bit', 'more', 'modern', 'cockney/', 'brogue', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'then', 'Native', 'actors', 'show', ""'re"", 'clearly', 'more', 'comfortable', 'native', 'Spanish', 'Ojibway', 'Powhatan', 'dialect', 'attempt', 'film', 'One', 'small', 'notable', 'historical', 'goof', 'globe', 'Smith', 'new', 'office', 'globe', 'land', 'mass', 'demarked', 'China', 'curious', 'because', 'time', 'was', 'still', 'popularly', 'known', 'Dutch', 'English', 'sailors', 'Cathay', 'was', 'visually', 'stunning', 'horrifically', 'boring', 'film', 'sincere', 'hope', 'history', 'students', 'future', 'certainly', 'casual', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'subjected']",N/A

First, the cons:  there were few normal conversations or normal dialogue for that matter in this movie.  I feel we're getting somewhere in the direction and plot development of a movie when people actually will converse. There wasn't much conversing going on in this film and I found myself eagerly soaking up the dialogue and wanting more when we did finally come across some intelligible speech in this film.  Also, Captain Smith and Pocahontas intone their thoughts throughout the movie.  We hear their thoughts as we view scenery of the New World. When Colin Farrell was narrating Smith's thoughts....it seems he spoke too low and mumbled.  I had my TV volume maxed out and could only understand 50% of what he said at most. I mean, speak up !  Maybe I just need a new TV.....but,a movie shouldn't be that much work.  okay, the pros: The film is beautifully shot and visually captivating at times.  There are scenes where the musical score combines with the scenery to produce some really memorable stuff.  Despite the conversational and script-related shortcomings I mentioned above....I did get where the movie was going.

This achingly beautiful work is only the fourth film in over thirty years by Malick, one of the least prolific and most talented directors in American movies.  As with his previous films, ""Badlands,"" Days of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line,"" Malick eschews storyline and action for artistry and mood.""The New World"" is a haunting evocation of that moment when two alien cultures met for the first time face to face.  The year is 1607 and a fleet of ships dispatched by King James of England arrives on the shores of North America to establish a new settlement called (what else?) Jamestown.  There to greet them is a beautiful young Indian princess known to us as Pocahontas who winds up captivating and falling in love with John Smith, the future leader of the settlement.  Along with the expected clash of cultures, Malick showcases the heartbreaking story of two people who fall in love but are ultimately kept apart by their differences.Nobody captures the sheer exquisiteness of the natural landscape better than Malick, and every shot here is a masterpiece of composition, form and lighting.  Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has wrought endless miracles with his camera in terms of both movement and the framing of his subjects.  Although the film is extremely studied and slow-moving, it is never static or boring, so enthralled are we by what it is showing us.  Malick reminds us here that for all the advancements made in the art of special effects, it is good old-fashioned photography that can really make the jaw drop and the eye pop when it is done this well.  Moreover, Malick has used natural sound beautifully, weaving it into the fabric of his love story, much as he has done with the exquisite and haunting musical score composed by James Horner (""Titanic"").Even though the characters say little to one another - much of the dialogue comes in the form of voiceover recitations of journal entries or interior monologues - the filmmaker is able to convey romantic yearning with extraordinary force, primarily through facial expressions, bodily movements and lyrical camerawork.  As Smith, Collin Farrell provides just the right combination of brooding introspection and wistful tender-heartedness to make the romance work.  15-year-old newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher turns Pocahontas into an almost ethereal presence, perfectly matching the dreamlike nature of the film.It would appear that the Motion Picture Academy has chosen to snub this film in most of the major categories (with the exception of cinematography).  What a shame, for even though some people might dismiss ""The New World"" as just Art with a capital ""A,"" this is actually one of the most enthralling and cinematically beautiful films of recent times.

What you get is a cinematic poem. There is a story, and there is drama, but not in the conventional sense. The story and the drama lie in the gradual discovery of a new land, with new people in it, new beginnings - the ruminations of John Smith about building a new commonwealth where all will help one another, exploitation of labour will be shunned, and nobody shall make profit out of weakness is a standing indictment of what we know will be the nature of the new world being made; we've only been here an hour and we've already made a mess of it is the telling counterpoint made by Christopher Plummer's commander later.The starving times, the distrust of the natives who are planning to destroy the colony if the settlers don't go back, the wonder as Smith's love for Pocahontas grows, are all told through the natural surroundings, the (anachronistic) music, the trance-like language - inner monolgues in the best Malik fashion.Then - ouch, I hate to say this, but the last 40 minutes go all badly wrong. They return to England, the inner monologues (almost) vanish along with the beauty of the surroundings, but just where some sort of drama is needed to keep the film going, the cinematic poem turns into a costume documentary where all the characters wander around lost, in a pointless introduction of the native princess to King James and his gracious Queen (the music stops being anachronistic, turning into the Jacobean artifice of the masque, just when I was hoping for John Lennon to curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git).Sorry, I did enjoy the film, but the last 40 minutes did suck, and doesn't get better on further showings.",4,almost brilliant,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,2089,"['am', 'great', 'fan', 'Terence', 'Malik', 'movies', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'high', 'enough', 'buy', 'dvd', 'extras', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'enlightening', 'movie', 'historical', 'context', 'Malik', 'intent', '.It', 'would', 'be', 'horribly', 'disappointing', 'went', 'looking', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'just', 'would', 'be', 'frustrating', 'look', 'Saving', 'Sgt', 'Ryan', 'when', 'go', 'see', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'What', 'get', 'cinematic', 'poem', 'story', 'drama', 'not', 'conventional', 'sense', 'story', 'drama', 'lie', 'gradual', 'discovery', 'new', 'land', 'new', 'people', 'new', 'beginnings', 'ruminations', 'John', 'Smith', 'building', 'new', 'commonwealth', 'where', 'will', 'help', 'one', 'exploitation', 'labour', 'will', 'be', 'shunned', 'nobody', 'shall', 'make', 'profit', 'weakness', 'standing', 'indictment', 'what', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'nature', 'new', 'world', 'being', 'made', ""'ve"", 'only', 'been', 'here', 'hour', ""'ve"", 'already', 'made', 'mess', 'telling', 'counterpoint', 'made', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'commander', 'later.The', 'starving', 'times', 'distrust', 'natives', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'destroy', 'colony', 'settlers', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'wonder', 'Smith', 'love', 'Pocahontas', 'grows', 'are', 'told', 'natural', 'surroundings', 'anachronistic', 'music', 'trance-like', 'language', 'inner', 'monolgues', 'best', 'Malik', 'fashion.Then', 'ouch', 'hate', 'say', 'last', '40', 'minutes', 'go', 'badly', 'wrong', 'return', 'England', 'inner', 'monologues', 'almost', 'vanish', 'beauty', 'surroundings', 'just', 'where', 'sort', 'drama', 'needed', 'keep', 'film', 'going', 'cinematic', 'poem', 'costume', 'documentary', 'where', 'characters', 'wander', 'lost', 'pointless', 'introduction', 'native', 'princess', 'King', 'James', 'gracious', 'Queen', 'music', 'being', 'anachronistic', 'turning', 'Jacobean', 'artifice', 'masque', 'just', 'when', 'was', 'hoping', 'John', 'Lennon', 'curse', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Raleigh', 'was', 'such', 'stupid', 'git', '.Sorry', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'last', '40', 'minutes', 'did', 'suck', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'further', 'showings']",N/A

Saul ""opinionated, yet  truthful, mu...","[6, 14]","I understand and appreciate the artistry of Terrance Mallick but he can be a very flawed director.This could have been an amazing movie with an all too familiar story (adoption by a tribe, think ""Avatar"" or ""Dances with Wolves"") but Mallick did too much with the cinematography and not enough with narration. Mallick also gets too enchanted with having his film express a poetic effect rather than having his film express story telling.This is the simple story of 17th century English explorers coming to North America and clashing with the native Indians. Instead of gloriying and putting an unrealistic sheen on that era, Mallick effectively depicts that in now way/ no how was it similar to how we live today. The native Americans are apparently civilized yet also very savage. The English appear civilized, but, in reality. much more savage than the Indians. The English bring with them disease and nothing is easy about living off of the land. Great premise but some real problems with the execution.Mallick improperly lets the camera do too much talking when he should pay more attention to dialog and narrative. He uses weird voice overs and does not properly segue when advancing time.Collin Farrell is an ostrocized English explorer that falls for the Indian Pochahantas. In between there are conflicts between the two groups from where these protagonists emenated from.There are battle scenes that should have been fantastic but they are confusing and do not advance the story. There is a seemingly beautiful blossoming of a relationship, yet the director explores it, backs off from it and does away with it. The English may appear more adorned but a close up of them make them look more barbaric than their Indian counterparts. There should have been fascinating nautical scenes yet, they are too much bypassed.Eventually Pochahantas is excommunicated from her tribe, is forced to live with the colonists and moves to England. That is where this film really goes sour.  I'm neither the smartest nor the dumbest guy, but it is really hard to tell what is going on, what the director's objectives were and what the point of the movie is in the last hour of this movie. The first part of this movie is Colonists enamored with this strange land, their conflicts with the Indians and a different perspective from the Indian's point of view. That could be pretty interesting and entertaining. The second half is quite boring.What distinguishes Mallick from other directors, how beautiful and etheral his films look like is the same thing that detracts it. His style comes across too pretentious when there is no need. A more straightforward, organic approach would have fortified the film. I saw ""The Tree of Life"" and loved Mallick's approach but that had a lot to do with the subject matter. This is practically a ""cowboys and indians"" flick, and the arty nature is inconsistent with the subject matter.Artistic directorial restraint, cutting back on it's length and remembering that a movie is supposed to entertain could have made this a whole lot better of a movie.",2,Beautiful to look at but not much going on,1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,3076,"['understand', 'appreciate', 'artistry', 'Terrance', 'Mallick', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'flawed', 'director.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'movie', 'too', 'familiar', 'story', 'adoption', 'tribe', 'think', 'Avatar', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Mallick', 'did', 'too', 'much', 'cinematography', 'not', 'enough', 'narration', 'Mallick', 'also', 'too', 'enchanted', 'having', 'film', 'express', 'poetic', 'effect', 'rather', 'having', 'film', 'express', 'story', 'telling.This', 'simple', 'story', '17th', 'century', 'English', 'explorers', 'coming', 'North', 'America', 'clashing', 'native', 'Indians', 'Instead', 'gloriying', 'putting', 'unrealistic', 'sheen', 'era', 'Mallick', 'effectively', 'now', 'how', 'was', 'similar', 'how', 'live', 'today', 'native', 'Americans', 'are', 'apparently', 'civilized', 'yet', 'also', 'very', 'savage', 'English', 'appear', 'civilized', 'reality', 'much', 'more', 'savage', 'Indians', 'English', 'bring', 'disease', 'nothing', 'easy', 'living', 'land', 'Great', 'premise', 'real', 'problems', 'execution.Mallick', 'improperly', 'camera', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'when', 'should', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'dialog', 'narrative', 'weird', 'voice', 'overs', 'not', 'properly', 'segue', 'when', 'advancing', 'time.Collin', 'Farrell', 'ostrocized', 'English', 'explorer', 'Indian', 'Pochahantas', 'are', 'conflicts', 'two', 'groups', 'where', 'protagonists', 'emenated', 'are', 'battle', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'are', 'confusing', 'do', 'not', 'advance', 'story', 'seemingly', 'beautiful', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'director', 'away', 'English', 'may', 'appear', 'more', 'adorned', 'close', 'make', 'look', 'more', 'barbaric', 'Indian', 'counterparts', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'nautical', 'scenes', 'yet', 'are', 'too', 'much', 'bypassed.Eventually', 'Pochahantas', 'excommunicated', 'tribe', 'forced', 'live', 'colonists', 'moves', 'England', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'sour', ""'m"", 'smartest', 'dumbest', 'guy', 'really', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'what', 'director', 'objectives', 'were', 'what', 'point', 'movie', 'last', 'hour', 'movie', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'Colonists', 'enamored', 'strange', 'land', 'conflicts', 'Indians', 'different', 'perspective', 'Indian', 'point', 'view', 'could', 'be', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'second', 'half', 'quite', 'boring.What', 'distinguishes', 'Mallick', 'other', 'directors', 'how', 'beautiful', 'etheral', 'films', 'look', 'same', 'thing', 'style', 'too', 'pretentious', 'when', 'need', 'more', 'straightforward', 'organic', 'approach', 'would', 'have', 'fortified', 'film', 'saw', 'Tree', 'Life', 'loved', 'Mallick', 'approach', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'subject', 'matter', 'practically', 'cowboys', 'indians', 'flick', 'arty', 'nature', 'inconsistent', 'subject', 'matter.Artistic', 'directorial', 'restraint', 'cutting', 'back', 'length', 'remembering', 'movie', 'supposed', 'entertain', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'movie']",N/A

Mullen,"[12, 38]","I was quite looking forward to the release of this movie; I'm interested in Native American Indian history and was also interested to see a movie claiming to portray the story of Pocahontas ""almost historically accurately"" (I refused to see the cartoon solely on the basis that it was so far from the historical record).  Apparently they took their claim of historical accuracy a ""little"" more loosely (""creatively"") than I was led to believe beforehand; had I understood beforehand that it was going to be portrayed as such I probably would not have seen it in the first place . . . it struck me as the Disney movie, live-action, only the deleted scenes, with several long periods of black screen randomly inserted (I would have, you know, put them at the end, after it was over), with little-to-no dialogue (Q'Orianka Kilcher even looks amazingly like the cartoon character, which I noted before I saw the movie).  Many people on here use condescension to lead you to believe that anyone who doesn't find it exquisite has bad taste or is stupid or ignorant; it is like that on many of the reviews for movies/books/shows that are either loved or hated.  I say, some people love it and some hate it, and there's probably some degree of bad taste, stupidity, and ignorance on both sides.  To me, however, who's seen many long movies and rarely stops watching one, even if it was bad (I always hope it'll get better), and has never felt one was longer than it was, this one got bad fast, stayed bad, and became interminably long . . . I don't remember the length, but it SEEMED like it was at least 5 hours long.  I would advise you to skip it.Edit, 4/15/06:  I had to add one more thing--had the ""deleted scenes"" effect been utilized on actual scenes that could have been in either a realistic Pocahontas's or a fictionalized Pocahontas's life, it could have potentially been enjoyable; but to me, watching the ""clips"" of her spinning in circles repeatedly and silently for years of her life with her chosen partner was not ""artistic"" or meaningfully symbolic but unrealistic and unenjoyable.",1,I must agree with those who have termed it overrated,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,2091,"['was', 'quite', 'looking', 'forward', 'release', 'movie', ""'m"", 'interested', 'Native', 'American', 'Indian', 'history', 'was', 'also', 'interested', 'see', 'movie', 'claiming', 'portray', 'story', 'Pocahontas', 'almost', 'historically', 'accurately', 'refused', 'see', 'cartoon', 'solely', 'basis', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'historical', 'record', 'Apparently', 'took', 'claim', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'little', 'more', 'loosely', 'creatively', 'was', 'led', 'believe', 'beforehand', 'had', 'understood', 'beforehand', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'portrayed', 'such', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'place', 'struck', 'Disney', 'movie', 'live-action', 'only', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'several', 'long', 'periods', 'black', 'screen', 'randomly', 'inserted', 'would', 'have', 'know', 'put', 'end', 'was', 'over', 'little-to-no', 'dialogue', ""Q'Orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'even', 'amazingly', 'cartoon', 'character', 'noted', 'saw', 'movie', 'Many', 'people', 'here', 'use', 'condescension', 'lead', 'believe', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'find', 'bad', 'taste', 'stupid', 'ignorant', 'many', 'reviews', 'movies/books/shows', 'are', 'loved', 'hated', 'say', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'probably', 'degree', 'bad', 'taste', 'stupidity', 'ignorance', 'sides', 'however', 'who', 'seen', 'many', 'long', 'movies', 'rarely', 'stops', 'watching', 'one', 'even', 'was', 'bad', 'always', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'get', 'better', 'never', 'felt', 'one', 'was', 'longer', 'was', 'one', 'got', 'bad', 'fast', 'stayed', 'bad', 'became', 'interminably', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'length', 'SEEMED', 'was', 'least', '5', 'hours', 'long', 'would', 'advise', 'skip', 'it.Edit', '4/15/06', 'had', 'add', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'had', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'effect', 'been', 'utilized', 'actual', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'realistic', 'Pocahontas', 'fictionalized', 'Pocahontas', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'potentially', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'watching', 'clips', 'spinning', 'circles', 'repeatedly', 'silently', 'years', 'life', 'chosen', 'partner', 'was', 'not', 'artistic', 'meaningfully', 'symbolic', 'unrealistic', 'unenjoyable']",N/A

Oh, the subject matter is completely different (WW 2 battle flick vs. Jamestown story), but with Mallick this almost seems beside the point - since what he cares about is the Human Condition and other BIG bellybutton pondering Why Are We Here kind of questions.  And Mallick does approach these questions with a poetry and style that leaves the viewer thinking.  Imagine, if you will, a Stanley Kubrick who actually cares about people, and you have Mallick.  But in a long movie -at some point, a viewer wants a story to break out.  What Mallick delivers instead is an Art Gallery.Precise period detail, gorgeous cinema photography, performances...?  I suppose they're pretty good, though it's hard to get much traction with the characters, since they are just part of the scenery.  The credits say John Savage was in the movie.  I must of missed him.  And Wes Studi is just used as Native Background.  (By the way, Natives and their reactions to the Jamestown settlers are first rate, and for that reason alone make the New World worth seeing.  One senses that Mallick did an enormous amount of research for this film.)  Colin Farrell is ok as John Smith, looking appropriately all moody and lank-haired, but given Mallick's structure, it's hard to penetrate that character's motivations (what was that flipping over the table thing all about?).  For example, why did he turn his back on a relationship with Pocahantas?  I'll admit the answer very well could of been right in front of me, but by that point in the movie, I was floating on a dream, and such character specifics could of slipped right on by.  But that does bring me to the performance of Q'rianka Kilcher as Pocohantas.  She is incredible, and by movie's end, she has made the story (overwhelmingly) her own.  Pocohantas's transition from nature romping Indian to the wife of an English man (an effective Christian Bale as John Rolfe) is not some sort of flat trajectory, but one filled with complexity and nuance.  To pull that off, you need a great actor - and a great director.

His previous films, ""Badlands"", ""Days of Heaven"", and ""The Thin Red Line"", have all been works of beauty and critical acclaim. Malick shot over one million feet of film in making ""The New World"", and the extended cut is richer and more provocative than the original. While not a prolific director, his works are fantastic studies of characters and nature. He likes to film during ""The Golden Hours"" of sunrise and sunset, which gives his scenes of romance, turmoil, and nature a golden glow. He is expert at capturing people in the essence of their meeting, as he captured Colin Farrell and Q'Orianka Kilcher first setting eyes on each other, as well as their first kiss. The crew built their Jamestown fort from scratch, using as close to the original building materials as possible, according to the original layout, and close to the original location in Virginia. Kilcher learned some of the now-extinct dialect of Virginian Algonquin language to speak her lines. Only fourteen at the time the film started, Kilcher was new to film and love. Some of her scenes with Colin were removed by the studio for fear of accusations of child pornography. However, Malick is not a pornographer, and Pocahontas was younger than fourteen when she met Captain John Smith. While the romance may be somewhat fictionalized, most of the historical information about Captain John Smith and Jamestown are accurate.

It is because there are so many people in modern American society who are dead on the inside, mere spiritual space-occupying shells, unable to feel the personality of the very real Pocahontas the movie accurately captures, let alone even remotely understand the dichotomy between the more worldly English and the less materially focused natives they encountered.Historical accounts dimly capture the persona of a vibrant, intelligent, precocious, empathetic, beautiful, as well as courageous real-life Indian Princess known to the English as ""Pocahontas"".  Her love of life and her effect on those around her is stunningly captured by this spectacular take on the John Smith/Pocahontas real life Romeo and Juliet tragedy.  John Smith's near fatal injury (his gunpowder pouch exploded against his upper thigh) is the initial reason that Smith leaves America (and Pocahontas), as accurately portrayed in the movie, but why he never returns to her is unknown (I believe that he may have been impotent after the injury), but Malik intelligently speculates that Smith tragically chose fame and fortune over the love of a magnificent woman.  Their final meeting is, once again, accurately portrayed.The stunning cinematography, a Malik mainstay, greatly contributes to this great story...a visual masterpiece welded to one of history's greatest lessons.",5,Paradise Lost,1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,1410,"['understandable', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'underrated', 'great', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'modern', 'American', 'society', 'who', 'are', 'dead', 'inside', 'mere', 'spiritual', 'space-occupying', 'shells', 'unable', 'feel', 'personality', 'very', 'real', 'Pocahontas', 'movie', 'accurately', 'let', 'alone', 'even', 'remotely', 'understand', 'dichotomy', 'more', 'worldly', 'English', 'less', 'materially', 'focused', 'natives', 'encountered.Historical', 'accounts', 'dimly', 'capture', 'persona', 'vibrant', 'intelligent', 'precocious', 'empathetic', 'beautiful', 'as', 'well', 'courageous', 'real-life', 'Indian', 'Princess', 'known', 'English', 'Pocahontas', 'love', 'life', 'effect', 'stunningly', 'captured', 'spectacular', 'take', 'John', 'Smith/Pocahontas', 'real', 'life', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'tragedy', 'John', 'Smith', 'near', 'fatal', 'injury', 'gunpowder', 'pouch', 'exploded', 'upper', 'thigh', 'initial', 'reason', 'Smith', 'America', 'Pocahontas', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'why', 'never', 'unknown', 'believe', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'impotent', 'injury', 'Malik', 'intelligently', 'Smith', 'tragically', 'chose', 'fame', 'fortune', 'love', 'magnificent', 'woman', 'final', 'meeting', 'once', 'again', 'accurately', 'portrayed.The', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'Malik', 'mainstay', 'greatly', 'great', 'story', 'visual', 'masterpiece', 'welded', 'one', 'history', 'greatest', 'lessons']",N/A

While some of the story is merely based on legend, the fact still remains that the British arrived in Jamestown in 1607 and colonized a new land that would prosper and eventually turn into this New World they so desperately seeked.As other historical epics of our time, The New World strays away from the clashes between Native and Foreigner and provides little action sequences that attract many viewers to the big screen to watch a movie.  When we think of the first English settlers, many comparisons are made to the early conquistadors that conquered the Indies, Central and South America and Mexico.  We undoubtedly are reminded of the bloodshed that took place as Spanish armadas forced their way into strange marshlands and conquered the once powerful races of the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans and many other indigenous tribes.  However, history states that the first settlers to arrive in Jamestown were mainly entrepeneurs sent over by the King to colonize the land in his name.  Few soldiers were sent and the few that were sent were met with little to no conflict.The story of Pocahontas and John Smith is simply a love story between two people of different lives that happen to come across each other by chance.  They have nothing in common, but one thing.  Love.  Whether it is genuine or forced, both of them seemed to have found an interest in one another that impacted them both deeply.  Two people from different worlds share their beliefs and feelings and in a world of disarray for the early settlers, the both of them seem to bring a sense of calm to the world they live in.  They entrap themselves in each other and with the earth, that they do not worry about the problems and state of the society and culture around them.Terrence Malick is not a good director, he is a brilliant director.  The work that he does is almost play-like.  You visit a theater to see a play, and the actors are right there in front of you, performing.  You could almost touch them if you were to be so bold.  This is a form of reality that Malick brings to his movies.  I don't believe he is showing you a movie to make a buck off of you.  If he wanted to do that, he would put out whatever garbage he can get his hands on and probably still make a good amount of dough simply on name recognition.  No, instead he wants you the audience to also get involved.  He wants you to live what he is shooting.  To live with the characters.  Whether it be with lavish sceneries or inside the thoughts of the actor, there is always a sense of beauty, understanding, and compassion for whatever the subject.There are those that will think this movie is a bore.  But they are making the mistake of looking for something that is not there.  There is not going to be a battle or bloodshed and tears throughout.  There is going to be beauty, peace, and an appreciation for scenery and dialogue and the mere fact that when you put the both of them together as your centerpiece for a film, they manage to work beautifully.  If anything, this movie is more of a reality to the story than some big budget film with loads of special effects and stunts.  Isn't that what some of us complain about the most though?  The fact that films tend to stray away from factual accounts and go elsewhere with the story?  Well here you have it.  Here is something that's as close to the story and the era as can be.  Sometimes we just fool ourselves with what's a great film and truly artistic.

(1) The editing with unexpected jumps in shots and frequent blackouts require the viewers to really work at following the film.

The ""Making of The New World"" portion of the DVD speaks about all the great care taken to make this film authentic. Actors learn to talk and move like Algonquins. Genuine wild turkey feathers are used. They build a replica of the fort. It's shot on location in Virginia. It's too bad they got everything right except the story.Just like Disney, Malick invents a love story out of Captain John Smith and Pocahontas. Q'orianka Kilcher, who plays Pocahontas, even looks like the human version of the Disney Pocahontas. Pocahontas was only 12-years-old when she met John Smith. She looks like an 18-year-old siren in this film. There is no evidence that John Smith and Pocahontas felt anything more than respect and friendship for each other. At most, Pocahontas may have felt a young girl crush for the commanding presence of Smith, but even that is speculation. Since half the movie is devoted to the passionate romance between the two, this is a huge blunder.I could say much more about the other blunders, about John Smith and the Indians, Powhatan, the capture of Pocahontas, John Rolfe. Just about the whole story, actually. And it didn't help that Colin Farrell, playing John Smith, mumbled so many of his lines that I was forced to activate captions. Both Smith and Rolfe looked like love-struck puppies in the presence of Pocahontas.

Terrence Malick has been in the industry for over 30 years and only has about 5 pictures under his name.  He takes time and creates the film he wants.The New World is not a great ""movie"" in the traditional sense.  There are voice overs, when there actually is dialogue it is quick and to the point.  When there's action, it is also quick, ruthless and used to give across a point, not for the actual action itself.  What Malick does well is create a portrait, a painting of that time period and what was happening.  By paring down the story of Pocahontas (though she is never called that in the movie nor is called anything until she receives the name Rebecca), Malick shows us not the highly stylized version or the romantic version as it has come to be known.  The movie is about her journey, her discovery and eventually her ending.The plot is very elusive.  There really isn't one in the traditional sense; the plot is hidden behind subtle pieces of dialogue, images on the screen.  Someone not paying attention might get confused as to what's going on (I say this because the people sitting behind me were giving a running commentary the entire movie ""What's going on?"" ""What just happened?"" etc).  Malick also takes into account that you know the story, at least in essence, of Pocahontas.But it is also about the quality of nature and Malick reminds us how beautiful the land is.  Portions of the movie stars just nature with maybe a voice over explaining their feelings, but at the same time it reflects the cinematography.  Its beautiful to watch.

975495,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000EOTTTU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[15, 22]","English settlers land in what will become Virginia, meeting the ""Naturals"", the Indian tribe who lives in the area. Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) stops the planned hanging of Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell), asking him to lead an expedition to the north, to meet the indigenous tribe's leader. Smith soon meets Pocahontas (newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher) and they are each intrigued by the strangeness of the other. Returning to the settlement, Smith finds his fellow settlers are living in squalor and almost starving. Taking charge, he manages to help them survive the winter, along with a timely delivery of game and fowl by Pocahontas. Soon, they are under attack and they decide to bring the Indian princess there to live. As Pocahontas acclimates to her new life, Smith balances his desire for her with his desire to explore the New World.Terrence Malick's ""The New World"", his first film since ""The Thin Red Line"" in 1998, is certainly a beautiful film to watch, perhaps the most beautiful of the year. But as I watched the painterly compositions, I realized that even though his films are beautiful, they suffer from similar problems.Malick is one of a handful of directors who seem to compose every single frame of film as though it is a painted canvas. Composition, color, depth of field, everything in just about every scene is visually stunning, even when the settlers are living in squalor. Some of the shots brought to mind the work of Frederick Remington and his studies of Native Americans. Given the amount of time Malick takes to make a new film, it is clear he is more interested in creating art.During the first hour of ""World"", Smith and Pocahontas fall in love. It is interesting to watch Farrell and Kilcher portray this without words, at least words the other can understand. Each stares into the other's eyes as they walk in circles in a field. Or they might be walking together, Kilcher tracing the exposed muscles in Farrell's chest, as he watches her in rapt appreciation. As this continues, there becomes a noted lack of entrance into their relationship. Yes, we get the attraction of the new, the physical attraction. But unless we understand their thoughts, what is going on in their heads, we can't become emotionally invested in their relationship.Malick solves this problem in two ways. The first is with voice over narration. As Smith and Pocahontas are engaged in their mating dance, Farrell and Kilcher provide voice over, presumably their character's thoughts. But their narration is fairly esoteric, much like the characters are thinking love poetry they can't express verbally to each other. This adds to the lyrical nature of the film, almost creating a visual poem. It is intriguing to watch this, for about 30 minutes, and then you begin to hope for and expect more of a dramatic arch to the story.The second solution to the communication problem occurs when Pocahontas begins to learn English. Soon, she is very fluent, yet we still get the narrative love poems. They never seem to stop. And they are always accompanied by people staring at one another, or walking through a beautiful field. It becomes more than a little monotonous. It is like going to a museum and viewing an overly large collection of landscapes painted in the same style. They may be pretty, but after 20 or so, it becomes difficult to tell them apart.""World"" depicts the founding of the first settlement in Virginia, the relationship between Pocahontas and Smith and later her relationship with John Rolfe (Christian Bale), the relationship between the settlers and the Naturals, and more. Stuff happens. So why does the film feel so inert? A significant portion of screen time is devoted to characters staring at each other, as they circle one another, gazing into each other's eyes as they prance around in a stream, or their hands gliding across the other's flesh, as the voiceover attempts to explain their burgeoning love.""World"" is based on actual events in history, but Malick makes a wrong turn in the last 45 minutes. I don't care if it actually happened or not, we don't need to see Pocahontas travel back to England with Rolfe. Again, the scenes are beautiful to watch. And I understand why Malick wanted to include this. We have seen Smith's New World, now we must see Pocahontas' New World as well. The problem is Pocahontas has become so integrated into the lives of the settlers her discovery of England doesn't have the power of Smith's. And it only makes the film that much longer.Farrell and Kilcher are both good. Am impressive supporting cast (Christian Bale, Christopher Plummer, David Thewlis, Wes Studi, Jonathan Pryce) clearly wanted the opportunity to work with the respected filmmaker.Throughout, we don't get enough of a sense of what makes John Smith tick. Why did he leave his relationship with Pocahontas? Why the teary reunion in England filled with regrets? What is the point of these scenes? Malick devotes so much attention to the visual, that he doesn't seem concerned with answering these questions. Until we can understand, the drama will falter.Malick's films are always beautiful to watch, but the dramatic elements receive less attention. Until Malick is able to more evenly distribute his attentions, his films will always be beautiful, but frustrating.",3,"Beautiful To Look At, But...",1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,5317,"['English',

The production budget for this film is reported to have been $30 million, while the worldwide grosses are only slightly more than that, which means that the movie tanked.  Nonetheless, it stays close to the historical facts relating to John Smith; and Pocahontas, John Rolfe and their son Thomas Rolfe, whose descendants are said to include President Woodrow Wilson's wife.Native Americans participated in its filming; and as the special features indicate, the production crew did everything possible to make the film authentic.  Indeed, whoever fancies becoming a moviemaker needs to watch the DVD's special features, to realize how much work went into a film that did not break even.  The cast was superb, especially newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher, who was 14 when she was chosen to play the lead, and was graceful, lovely and did a fine job.  The film is slow at times, but the times were slow then too.The film should have been titled ""Pocahontas,"" because it is the amazing story of one woman's life.  Instead, its actual title--which is innocuous at best, and probably did nothing to sell the movie--was probably chosen because Disney's cartoon epics by the same title were released in 1995 and 1998 (with the second one being subtitled ""Journey to a New World"").  Yet, that change alone might have increased its grosses, at least among women.

Malick understands films are visual, and the film is noticeably dialogue light. In fact, it's a movie that could have been shot without dialogue, and while that would have been confusing, the fact the cinematography is so perfect I still would not have cared. Watching the film I am constantly reminded of how picturesque our country really is.The film eschews what many believe were the historical events at Jamestown for the myth that has been handed down. Most historians now believe that John Smith wasn't going to be executed, but was actually being initiated into the tribe in what would be now viewed as a kind of hazing ritual. This was supposed to have helped relations between the settlers and the Native Americans. John Smith was also a well known braggart and liar, and had told many stories where his life was spared by a gorgeous woman who had fallen in love with him. In fact, it is likely Pocahontas was sent to the colony as an ambassador between the two people in hopes of keeping the peace.However, it does not bother me that Malick chose the myth over history because he perfectly captures the lives of early settlers. In A People's History of the United States, Howard Zinn describes one failed settlement after another, many Europeans finding that survival meant leaving their settlement and joining the local native tribes (which was sometimes punished by death). The winters were harsh in this new world and the English did not have the skills the Native Americans had, such as growing corn, squash, and other American foods in soil that was far less hospitable than Europe's. Malick presents this desperation perfectly, and even alludes to possible cannibalism that may have taken place. Even when well meaning, the English are a people who rule through a strict hierarchy and are not hesitant to use the harshest means to insure order (shooting, hanging, and whipping to name a few).The Natives are presented as a people conflicted. They don't want to start a war, but are weary that the newcomers will soon want more land than the swamps they've settled. Unlike the Europeans, who have one leader whose commands filter to the rest of the people unquestioned, the Native Chief accepts input from his advisors, and ultimately acquiesces to his daughter and spares John Smith's life. They are presented as a people who live naturally with the world around them, and do not have to put nature under their dominion, but rather symbiotically live within nature.Ultimately, The New World is a tragedy about love and imperialism. I would have to watch it several more times to find something more interesting to say. It's hard to watch the film without knowing that the disease that took Pocahontas's life would similarly wipe out whole Native villages along with a vicious military campaign.

I expected a history with plenty of drama and action. Goodness knows, the actual event had plenty of that. What I got were long periods of silence with Capt Smith gazing calf-eyed at Pocahontas and a few voice-overs here and there which didn't really seem relevant to what was happening onscreen. What little they did show wasn't exactly accurate. Smith arrived at the New World in chains, yes. He was nearly executed, yes. But it wasn't because they changed their minds, needing every man they could get. It was because upon opening the orders given them by the Company, it was discovered he was one of the men put in charge of the expedition. Now how would that look? To execute one of the leaders?Characterizations are so scanty as to be almost nonexistent. The Native Americans are portrayed as childlike, living idyllically, playing and swimming, while watching the white men with curiosity. They never show anger, not even when a couple are captured and one is shot in the back for stealing.  They just keep coming back and crowding around as if fascinated.  Even Powhatan  who refuses to kill Smith but decides he can teach his daughter something...and apparent the good captain does...is an enigmatic figure. The scene in which they meet and converse, each speaking in his own language, is confusing to say the least. How did either understand the other's intent? And Pocahontas?  She's either dancing through the forest, splashing in the surf, or making mystical gestures to the sky while intoning...something when she isn't letting Smith feel her up...and even that's done with such a hesitancy one wonders what, if anything actually happened.The scenery is beautiful, visual masterpieces, the photography artistically magnificent. Too bad the storyline didn't follow that same path. There was a lot of history just waiting to be dramatized. As it was, all I saw were leisurely camera pans and not much else.

975504,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000EOTTTU,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","The New World is the least of Terrence Malick's limited filmography to date, and could be best described as a monotone poem. It's not exactly bad, just mundane and rather forgettable even while you're watching it, more of a self-indulgence than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience. Visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired, while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections from his classical music collection, which doesn't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out: even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings. Another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific Colin Farrell, a nice enough lad offscreen I'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry a picture no matter how many chances he's given. True to form he trots out his two `important picture' expressions - the Bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he's not been getting enough roughage in his diet. The fact that he's outshone by Q'orianka Kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy, although to be fair he has been worse. Indeed, among the male leads Christian Bale does much, much more with much, much less in the last third of the film, as does a typically underused Christopher Plummer in the first third.Malick is very good at the madness and mutiny that infects the deluded settlers of Jamestown, but because it happens to people we've barely been introduced to it carries no emotional or dramatic weight. If anything, it just made me think of how much more Herzog could have made of it all. Moments work, most notably the expulsion of the `Naturals' from their land and the brief latter sequences in England, but on the evidence of the 135-minute version I very much doubt Malick's promised longer cut will solve the problems. I know it's meant to be a work of art, but I just came away with the feeling that I'd watched an old and very average Universal International 50s Western redubbed by first-year philosophy students.

975505,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000EOTTTU,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 7]","`The New World"" is not about debunking of the famous Pocahontas myth Disney took up about ten years ago; it is more about director Terence Malick's attempt to create his own myth about this elusive historical figure. The result is sort of poetic journey to the `New World' with the mesmerizing beauty of the universe it depicts. Still `The New World' remains as elusive as the story of Pocahontas and the film looks sometimes confusing and emotionally detached.The story of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith needs no introduction. It is part of the history of America, and Terence Malick tries to present it as accurately as possible. Every scene is shot with the available light. The life in Fort Jamestown is terribly desolate, and there is nothing glorious about the battles between the immigrants and the natives. The film also avoids showing any political messages about this `New World.'But accuracy alone cannot make a film. To tell the story, Terence Malick uses curious method that would divide the opinions among the viewers. That is, the slow-moving film seldom uses dialogues. Instead of that, Malick employs the voiceovers of each character, which reveals his/her heart directly to the audiences, not to another character. I know the intention, and I even admire that, but the results are hardly effective. The spoken language here lacks the emotion while the film is about the emotion about a man - no, two men -- and a woman. These spoken words sound like the unrefined English translation of the old Greek poems. Or maybe that is the point.I don't know Colin Farrell is the first choice of Terence Malick for the role of Captain John Smith. I hear the raving reviews about the acting of him and Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas, but frankly I am not sure. Their acting in the first act, especially that of Q'Orianka Kilcher is simply amazing, using the expressive body language to the full, but in the second half, in which the Captain makes a grave decision, they begin to look less convincing. Why did he do that? How did she accept that? Terence Malick leaves that part to our imagination, but gives no clue with which we can interpret the key scenes.Or did I miss something? I don't know. True, I was absorbed in the lush scenery, the amazingly lively portrait of Pocahontas, and the New World itself. I can still feel the beauty of it after leaving the theater. At the same time, I think the beauty of the paradise and its innocence does not need the sprawling 135 minutes and the unfocused narrative. `The New World' is like watching a great painting in museum; some can do it for hours, and even love it, but others prefer something different.",3,"Re-imagined Love Story of Pocahontas Has Amazingly Beautiful Photography with Slow, Frustrating Narrative",1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,2665,"['New', 'World', 'not', 'debunking', 'famous', 'Pocahontas', 'myth', 'Disney', 'took', 'up', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'more', 'director', 'Terence', 'Malick', 'attempt', 'create', 'own', 'myth', 'elusive', 'historical', 'figure', 'result', 'sort', 'poetic', 'journey', 'New', 'World', 'mesmerizing', 'beauty', 'universe', 'Still', 'New', 'World', 'remains', 'as', 'elusive', 'story', 'Pocahontas', 'film', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'emotionally', 'detached.The', 'story', 'Pocahontas', 'Captain', 'John', 'Smith', 'introduction', 'part', 'history', 'America', 'Terence', 'Malick', 'present', 'as', 'accurately', 'possible', 'scene', 'shot', 'available', 'light', 'life', 'Fort', 'Jamestown', 'terribly', 'desolate', 'nothing', 'glorious', 'battles', 'immigrants', 'natives', 'film', 'also', 'showing', 'political', 'messages', 'New', 'World', 'alone', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'film', 'tell', 'story', 'Terence', 'Malick', 'curious', 'method', 'would', 'divide', 'opinions', 'viewers', 'slow-moving', 'film', 'seldom', 'dialogues', 'Instead', 'Malick', 'voiceovers', 'character', 'his/her', 'heart', 'directly', 'audiences', 'not', 'character', 'know', 'intention', 'even', 'admire', 'results', 'are', 'hardly', 'effective', 'spoken', 'language', 'here', 'emotion', 'film', 'emotion', 'man', 'two', 'men', 'woman', 'spoken', 'words', 'sound', 'unrefined', 'English', 'translation', 'old', 'Greek', 'poems', 'maybe', 'point.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'first', 'choice', 'Terence', 'Malick', 'role', 'Captain', 'John', 'Smith', 'hear', 'raving', 'acting', ""Q'Orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'Pocahontas', 'frankly', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'acting', 'first', 'act', 'especially', ""Q'Orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'simply', 'amazing', 'using', 'expressive', 'body', 'language', 'full', 'second', 'half', 'Captain', 'grave', 'decision', 'begin', 'look', 'less', 'convincing', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'How', 'did', 'accept', 'Terence', 'Malick', 'part', 'imagination', 'clue', 'can', 'interpret', 'key', 'scenes.Or', 'did', 'miss', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'True', 'was', 'absorbed', 'lush', 'scenery', 'amazingly', 'lively', 'portrait', 'Pocahontas', 'New', 'World', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'beauty', 'leaving', 'theater', 'same', 'time', 'think', 'beauty', 'paradise', 'innocence', 'not', 'need', 'sprawling', '135', 'minutes', 'unfocused', 'narrative', 'New', 'World', 'watching', 'great', 'painting', 'museum', 'can', 'do', 'hours', 'even', 'love', 'others', 'prefer', 'something', 'different']",N/A
975506,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000EOTTTU,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","THE NEW WORLD is supposedly a film about John Smith, Pocahontas, and John Rolfe. I say supposedly because even though the plot of the film is centered around the love triangle between the three, the film really has very little to do with them. That's because this is a film written and directed by Terrence Malick. Malick's movies have a style completely of their own and there is no other filmmaker who makes movies the way Malick does. Malick's movies are like viewing a piece of continuous art that goes on for miles and miles. Watching a Malick flick is akin to experiencing a long and peaceful dream. The movie is filled with one beautiful image after another with very little dialogue.The plot of the film is taken from history. It's the 17th Century and John Smith leads a company of men upriver from their Jamestown colony to trade with the Indians. He's taken prisoner and falls in love with Princess Pocahontas. Knowing that he is being depended upon, Smith returns to the colony. The natives attack the colony. Pocahontas is taken captive. Smith is ordered to leave Jamestown. John Rolfe, a rich tobacco farmer, arrives at Jamestown. Rolfe falls in love with Pocahontas. The two are married. Later she's reunited with Smith and has to decide whom she will spend her life with.Colin Farrell has a lot of screen time in the movie. Personally I think this is one of Farrell's best performances ever. Of course, that might have to do with the fact that he doesn't speak for over half of the film. Q'Orianka Kilcher portrays Pocahontas and does a remarkable job. Christian Bale portrays John Rolfe and though he's not as interesting as he is as Bruce Wayne, he's a pleasure to watch.I usually don't like art films. I like a movie to have a great story told well, a movie with some great characterization, or a film that includes all of that. I saw THIN RED LINE, Malick's previous picture, when it came out and it almost put me to sleep. It was beautifully shot, but I just couldn't get into it. Since then I've learned a thing or two about cinematography and I respect the type of pictures that Malick makes. Even though I didn't like THE NEW WORLD as much as a movie such as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK or a solid drama like SIDEWAYS, I still enjoyed the movie.

I have very little to add beyond the descriptions here of it's visual and poetic beauty. One thing I would like to add that hasn't been touched on enough is the incredible acting by 14 year old newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher as Pocahantas. People here are complaining about the film's lack of dialogue. But, this young women's face is a remarkable centerpiece for a director brave enough to let it carry the film as such. And, a truely great actor is the one who expresses in visage the full range of emotions without speaking a word. Her performance literally broke my heart. Marvelous stuff, folks. In the Special Features, Collin Farrell said, ""she has so much light that comes out of her and just the right amount of darkness."" Well said. I never liked him much until I saw his performance in this and heard him say that.I did have trouble understanding some of the poetic voiceover, which is whispered mostly in a British accents. I suggest turning on the subtitles for the first viewing. It will enhance your enjoyment.Just as powerful as Malick's last film, A THIN RED LINE. And a welcome addition to Malick's poetry. He's my favorite filmmaker at the moment. If only he would work more. It should never come as a surprise that great art is never really appreciated by the masses until the next generation. Terrence Malick is a GREAT ARTIST who is truly ahead his of time.Those of you looking for an HISTORICAL ACTION EPIC, look elsewhere.

This is even more the case in this one, especially as he has such rich material to deal with; the intersection of two very different cultures within a landscape of raw, fertile beauty.True enough, this is not a quick movie. It's not an action film, even if the previews made it look like one. It's meditative and very visual. The director doesn't hold your hand and explain the history to you. So much is understated, and for a lot of moviewatchers understated is going to mean they just don't get it. (See the review below this one.) For example, there's a brief moment in the film when Pocahontas comes face to face with a black man in England. They just pass each other on the street, both staring into the other's face. It's such a cool moment, filled with complexity. Here are two vastly different people pulled out of vastly different cultures, meeting in passing on the streets of a European city. How strange, the film seems to suggest, that the same colonial forces that damage so much also lead to such unexpected meetings and interactions. But the whole exchange is like fifteen seconds long. Not a word is spoken. Nobody tells you what to think of the encounter. Malick just gives it to you and hopes that you're mature enough to have thoughts of your own.That's how this entire film is. Make no mistake - if average Hollywood fair is your thing you may not like this, may not know what to make of it except to conclude that it's boring.

Once violated (and from which the princess is cast out), it is no longer the garden of eden. It is the new world.3.

975516,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000EOTTTU,Wuchak,"[2, 2]","I've seen four of Terrence Malick's movies -- ""The New World"" (2005) and his three previous efforts, ""Badlands"" (1973), ""Days of Heaven"" (1978) and ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998). He's an artsy filmmaker who isn't interested in making conventional ""blockbusters."" His three earlier efforts are all well-done and in some ways great. For instance, his pictures are always beautiful and imaginative, but there's also an airy, leisurely quality that will turn off some viewers. My favorite, by far, is ""The Thin Red Line,"" a flawed masterpiece about the taking of a hill during the Guadalcanal Campaign in WWII. It successfully transcended it's storyline to seek answers to life's most profound questions. I guess Malick does this in all his films to some degree, but he was particularly effective with ""The Thin Red Line.""I mention this to stress that I'm familiar with Malick's films and understand his approach. I was really looking forward to ""The New World,"" a historical drama detailing the establishment of the 1607 Jamestown, Virginia, colony with Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell), Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher), John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and others (Christopher Plummer, Wes Studi, etc.).Shot near the actual locations on the Chickahominy River, Virginia, the film -- to be expected -- is beautiful to look at and the costumes, casting, etc. are all top-of-the-line. Unfortunately, for me, the pace is tedious and the themes aren't compelling enough to keep me spellbound. It's more than a tale of discovering a new world or new culture (for both sides); it's mostly a romance, which doesn't do much for me. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe because the pace was too draggy or possibly because I don't find Kilcher as Pocahontas all that captivating. Don't get me wrong, she's excellent in the role; I just don't find her anything to go ga-ga over, as Smith and Rolfe do in the story.One problem I have with the movie is the ridiculous romanticizing of the Natives as super-virtuous. Exhibit A is when Smith reflects in a voice-over: ""They are gentle, loving, faithful, lacking in all guile and trickery. The words denoting lying, deceit, greed, envy, slander, and forgiveness have never been heard. They have no jealousy, no sense of possession.""Why sure!If the Indians had no sense of possession why did they attack the settlement when the Englanders failed to leave the next Spring? Why were tribes in regular warfare all over the Americas? Are we to believe not one of the Natives knew what a lie was? Or jealousy, envy, greed and slander? I get that the naturals weren't yet defiled by European-styled urbanization, but to suggest the above is pretty absurd. You can't tell me there wasn't a brave or two who had his eyes on young Pocahontas and felt a ""smidgen"" of jealousy when Smith stirred her romantic interests.The only way I can get past such nonsense and enjoy the movie is the fact that the voice-over in question was SMITH's idealized, romanticized perspective of a people with which he was enamored. In other words, it wasn't reality; it was his temporarily clouded opinion.BOTTOM LINE: ""The New World"" will be more appreciated by those who enjoy artsy romantic films. For me, I'm in the middle: I see the good of the film -- even the greatness -- and value it, but I can't deny the film's shortcomings as far as a viewing experience goes. Regardless, it's great to be able to go back in time and visualize how it was when the Jamestown colony was established, highly romanticized as it is portrayed here.The film runs 136 minutes (long enough) and the extended cut 172 minutes.GRADE: C+",3,"Artsy, draggy historical romance",1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,3600,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'four', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'movies', 'New', 'World', '2005', 'three', 'previous', 'efforts', 'Badlands', '1973', 'Days', 'Heaven', '1978', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', '1998', 'artsy', 'filmmaker', 'who', ""n't"", 'interested', 'making', 'conventional', 'blockbusters', 'three', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'are', 'well-done', 'ways', 'great', 'instance', 'pictures', 'are', 'always', 'beautiful', 'imaginative', 'also', 'airy', 'leisurely', 'quality', 'will', 'turn', 'off', 'viewers', 'My', 'favorite', 'far', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'flawed', 'masterpiece', 'taking', 'hill', 'Guadalcanal', 'Campaign', 'WWII', 'successfully', 'transcended', 'storyline', 'seek', 'answers', 'life', 'most', 'profound', 'questions', 'guess', 'Malick', 'films', 'degree', 'was', 'particularly', 'effective', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'mention', 'stress', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'Malick', 'films', 'understand', 'approach', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'New', 'World', 'historical', 'drama', 'detailing', 'establishment', '1607', 'Jamestown', 'Virginia', 'colony', 'Captain', 'John', 'Smith', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Pocahontas', ""Q'orianka"", 'Kilcher', 'John', 'Rolfe', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'others', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Wes', 'Studi', 'etc', '.Shot', 'actual', 'locations', 'Chickahominy', 'River', 'Virginia', 'film', 'be', 'expected', 'beautiful', 'look', 'costumes', 'casting', 'etc', 'are', 'top-of-the-line', 'Unfortunately', 'pace', 'tedious', 'themes', 'are', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'enough', 'keep', 'spellbound', 'more', 'tale', 'discovering', 'new', 'world', 'new', 'culture', 'sides', 'mostly', 'romance', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'Why', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Maybe', 'pace', 'was', 'too', 'draggy', 'possibly', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'Kilcher', 'Pocahontas', 'captivating', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'excellent', 'role', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'go', 'ga-ga', 'over', 'Smith', 'Rolfe', 'do', 'story.One', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'ridiculous', 'romanticizing', 'Natives', 'super-virtuous', 'Exhibit', 'when', 'Smith', 'voice-over', 'are', 'gentle', 'loving', 'faithful', 'lacking', 'guile', 'trickery', 'words', 'denoting', 'lying', 'deceit', 'greed', 'envy', 'slander', 'forgiveness', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'heard', 'have', 'jealousy', 'sense', 'possession', 'Why', 'sure', 'Indians', 'had', 'sense', 'possession', 'why', 'did', 'attack', 'settlement', 'when', 'Englanders', 'failed', 'leave', 'next', 'Spring', 'Why', 'were', 'tribes', 'regular', 'warfare', 'Americas', 'Are', 'believe', 'not', 'one', 'Natives', 'knew', 'what', 'lie', 'was', 'jealousy', 'envy', 'greed', 'slander', 'get', 'naturals', 'were', ""n't"", 'yet', 'defiled', 'European-styled', 'urbanization', 'suggest', 'above', 'pretty', 'absurd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'brave', 'two', 'who', 'had', 'eyes', 'young', 'Pocahontas', 'felt', 'smidgen', 'jealousy', 'when', 'Smith', 'stirred', 'romantic', 'interests.The', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'such', 'nonsense', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'fact', 'voice-over', 'question', 'was', 'SMITH', 'idealized', 'romanticized', 'perspective', 'people', 'was', 'enamored', 'other', 'words', 'was', ""n't"", 'reality', 'was', 'temporarily', 'clouded', 'opinion.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'New', 'World', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'appreciated', 'who', 'enjoy', 'artsy', 'romantic', 'films', ""'m"", 'middle', 'see', 'good', 'film', 'even', 'greatness', 'value', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'as', 'far', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Regardless', 'great', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'visualize', 'how', 'was', 'when', 'Jamestown', 'colony', 'was', 'established', 'highly', 'romanticized', 'portrayed', 'here.The', 'film', '136', 'minutes', 'long', 'enough', 'extended', 'cut', '172', 'minutes.GRADE', 'C+']",N/A
975517,AY8WZDYR79GFV,B000EOTTTU,Yasha Banana,"[9, 48]","I, Yasha Banana, your 96-year-old film reviewer, am glad already to know that I'm not a complete masochist.Meaning: I turned this movie off before it was over.  (Good for me!)  It was so boring and so tedious it gave me a pain.  Over here; and over there.  And a heartburn.  Oy, such a heartburn you wouldn't believe.  And don't tell me it was the pastrami I brought to the movie theatre.The only other movie I saw by this goyim fellow Terence Malick -- Mistah Feency Schmeency Movie Director -- was ""The Thin Red Line,"" which I, Yasha Banana, liked very much.  The problem with this movie, however, ""The New World,"" is that, for one thing, it's as though you're seeing a spinoff of ""The Thin Red Line"" -- the voiceover, the similarity in music, the fact that in both movies a Westernized soldier breaks away from his militaristic, warrior-oriented life and finds peace and happiness living in a delightful, harmonious, non-European counterculture.I should be so lucky.  Instead what's my lot in life?  I live next door to a meshugener who plays Trini Lopez records all night long on his victrola.  You call this living?  Drives me crazy.  So where's *my* counterculture getaway already?Nah, this movie isn't for me.  I like a movie that keeps moving.  Because at 96-years-old anything on me that moves, I'm grateful.  In particular my bowels.For example, ""Singing in the Rain.""  Now there was, believe you me, there was *some* movie.  Ho-boy!  Bing-bang-boom, one scene after another -- who's over here, who's over there -- Gene Kelly is throwing Cyd Charisse across the room, Debbie Reynolds is jumping out of a cake, Donald O'Connor is running, tumbling, jumping and spritzing.  Gals kicking kicking their legs over their heads (sigh!).Debbie Reynolds.  She's Jewish?  I should be so lucky to run into such a peppy-perky gal.  I hear she's around 80 now.  Ah, what the hell, I always liked 'em young.Anyway, back to -- what was it I, Yasha J. Banana, was reviewing -- oh yeah ""The New World.""  It takes place in Virginia, right?  So, what, it doesn't rain in Virginia?  Colin Farrell couldn't maybe find an umbrella and do like Gene Kelly in ""Singin' in the Rain""?  Those lousy colonialist pig-dogs, those uptight Brits, they couldn't hire Debbie Reynolds to teach the Indian girls to kick their legs over their heads?  I mean, you know, just to get a peek.  You know how hard it is nowadays to get a gal to stand on a mirror.  Me, personally, Yasha J. Banana, I like to keep up on what's going on down there.Ahhh, so who listens to me anyway?  Okay, I don't say Colin Farrell has to prance around like Richard Simmons, but move it, boychick, move it!  Angst I don't need, peppy-perky I can use.Instead this goy Colin Farrell, ho boy, he droops, he drags, he kvetches.  Sort of like my third wife on our honeymoon.  I said ""I do"" and she said, ""Turn off the light, I'm exhausted.""I want *action* man!  I want someone to rush up to Colin Farrell and say something like: ""Thank God you're not Colin Powell!""  Or ""Quick, the hippopotamuses are escaping!  Man the lifeboats!""Action, man, action!See, then you don't know what's gonna happen next.  A regular ""dramatic moment"" you have.  People in the audience gasping, holding on to each other, spitting up their Goobers.But with this movie you know 25 minutes before the end of a scene what's gonna happen.  For instance, Colin (""Don't Call Me Powell"") Farrell and his Indian girlfriend are in a field.  They hardly speak.  They walk towards each other.  They circle each other.  They look deeply into each other's eyes. ... Meanwhile, I'm in my seat in the movie theatre and my pacemaker is getting low on batteries and I have to go pee.  And all this is going on for fifteen minutes.  So what, we're stupid?  We don't catch on that Colin Farrell is gonna schtup her?  So come on already, get to the point, start pilin' up the wood, Colin baby, you're in-like- Flynn, let the schtupping begin!Which requires me, Yasha J. Banana, to refer back to ""Singin' in the Rain.""  In ""Singing in the Rain"" Gene Kelly was hot for Debbie Reynolds.  Debbie Reymolds jumps out of a cake and for the rest of the movie Gene Kelly, because he's Irish-CAtholic, has to eat saltpeter sandwiches he's so excited.  Simple, right?  Everybody ""gets it,"" right?  Nobody has to be partake of any D-E-E-E-E-E-P thinking.  There's no slo-o-o-o-ow, tedious, draaaaaawn out dialogue.  No long, wistful, soulful goo-goo-eyed looks.  You like the gal, Colin?  She rings your chimes?  She does for you what Sophie Tucker did for me back in '37?  Then bust a move, boychick.  Get on with it, we don't have all day; this isn't ""War and Peace.""Also, the chief of the tribe, the Big Cheese -- this guy, we're told, is supposed to have fathered one hundred children.  Ho boy!  Now there's some action they could have shown us!!  Talk about workin' on the railroad.  (Didn't this guy have any hobbies?  And who did he score his Vaigra from?)But, no, those one hundred blessed moments, we don't see.  Instead this guy moves and talks just as slow as everybody else in the facockta movie.  Hey, listen, you show me some old geezer that's fathered a hundred kids and I'll show you a fast-talkin', fast-movin', silver-head son of a you-know-what.Put Charo in his harem and then you have a movie, mister!Also, if this guy fathered a hundred kids, where the heck are they?  I only saw about 30 or 40 Indian extras.  What? all his little cockers left the village, went to the big city and became social workers?  I, Yasha J. Banana, doubt that very much.Also ... as someone of European background myself, I must say, Europeans in this movie don't come off very well.  They're portrayed as brutal, militaristic, slimy, greedy low-life thugs.  OK, so we'll leave my third and fourth wives out of this for the time being; but what an awful image of us Europeans.  These English guys in the movie, these Europeans: they set up a colony and before you know, bing-bang-boom, the place turns into a regular pig-sty.  Like my fifth wife's condominium after mahjong.  (But why dwell?)OK, so us Europeans aren't perfect.  So Europeans raped and pillaged most of North America, South America, Africa, Asia and several neighborhoods in Brooklyn.So sue us!!You know, I once knew an Indian.  Never used a napkin.  Wiped his mouth on his sleeve.  But you don't see me making a movie about an entire race of people dripping corn kernels and wampum from their mouths, do you?  No sir!  No-sir-no-sir-NO-SIR!Just keep in mind the advice of the famous writer Nelson Algren: ""Never eat at a place called Mom's.  Never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than your own.  And never play cards with an Indian called Doc.""And this man was an author!Don't get me wrong, I love Indians.  Tonto: one tough Jewish Indian.  That's right, *Jewish.*  Who do you think gave him his bar mitzvah pen back in '38?  That's right, yours truly, Yasha J. Banana.  I loved that Indian.  I worshipped the ground he put his ear to to see if a taxi was coming.I love Indians.  I, personally -- and without a partner, I might point out -- opened a delicatessen in Cleveland back in '58, and every Cleveland Indian who came in, I treated like a prince.So what about us Caucasians?  We have no good points?  Come on, just because we have a history of being miserable, rotten, warlike plunderers -- everybody should know about it?  They shoud make *movies* about it?  Why not open up the back window and yell it out so all the neighbors can hear?  WE STINK! ON ICE!So who's perfect?  You want perfect, go see Oprah.  (The thin one.)Here's another thing ... In the movie the Indian lady, err, I mean the Indian *woman,* err, I mean, *the Native American lady,* err, I mean, *the ladylike Native American woman person* -- that one in the flicker; how's come she right away falls head over heels for Colin Farrell?  Just because he's good-looking?  If the Indian culture she lives in is so great, what? there isn't a good-looking guy or two she's already dating?  I, Yasha J. Banana, would think so.If this movie was realistic, the first half of it would be Colin Farrell trying to figure out how to deal with this Indian gal's truckload of boyfriends.  Come on, these virile young bucks are supposed to give her up without a fight?  We're supposed to believe that Colin Farrell strolls into the village, grabs the cutest gal in sight and all her boyfriends all of a sudden become gay?  Be serious.  You can't bamboozle me, man.  I have a mind to write Colin Farrell and ask him for my money back.  Who's he think he's foolin'?  All of the people all of the time?  Well not this chosen one.  Not this boychick.And I'll tell you something else, while we're on the subject.  And I didn't want to bring this up -- but these English guys didn't look all that clean and washed to me.  In fact, I hate to say it but my guess is that these fellows, including ""Mister Wonderful,"" Colin Farrell, they were all farshtunken.  That's Yiddish for stinky.  Like, P.U., man!  Especially Colin.  There he is, in all his stinkin' glory, coming to Virginia in the hole of a ship because he tried to mutiny.  What? they didn't have showers and a little ribbon around the toilets in the hole of a 17th century galley ship?  Oy, please, don't let me think about it, there must have been such a stink.  And then all of a sudden ""Mister Wonderful""  gets ashore, FRESH AS A DAISY!And he turn into a regular Mark Spitz.No sir!  No-sir-no-sir-NO-SIR!  I, Yasha J. Banana, know a farshtunken sailor when I see one.You can talk all you want about how wonderful this movie is and how wonderful it's message is, about peace and love and eating berries in the moonlight, but all I see are a bunch of stinky people who talk real slow trying to pass themselves off as Method actors.  Pretty soon Lee Strasberg's gonna show up as the chief of the tribe next door -- The Kleinman Indians.Bearing the famous ""Kleinman Diamond.""Which has a curse.*Mister* Kleinman.(c. Henny Youngman 1947)I give Henny Youngman 5 stars for that joke.  For that dreck of a movie, ""The New Eorld,"" I give one star.On consignment.Maybe I'll change my mind and want the star back.  I'll keep you posted.  Tell Colin Farrell I'm thinking about it.  He wants to negotiate -- we'll sit, we'll talk, we'll do, we'll make.Your pal,Yash",1,"You Can't Fool Me, Man!",1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,10333,"['Yasha', 'Banana', '96-year-old', 'film',
