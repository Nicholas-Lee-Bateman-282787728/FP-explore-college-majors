569746,A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0,B000056MO2,,"[8, 8]","For the past year and a half, I've been doing yoga and Pilates workouts (as well as more &quot;traditional&quot; aerobics and weight training).  I've gravitated to yoga because of the emphasis on the breathing, flexibility and overall thorough workout and to Pilates because of the emphasis on core strength.  I've achieved a lot of my fitness goals, but I still have the nagging feeling that I'm not &quot;going anywhere&quot; with my routines- exercise just for the sake of exercise doesn't quite sit right with me.  To that end, I started using Jennifer Kries' New Method series.  The addition of dance training does feel more functional, but I've found myself wishing that there was more dance in her series.Enter this video.  I love it!  The leg work is some of the best I've done.  When we plie or tendu, I feel not only like I'm getting a good leg workout but also like I'm dancing.  While the floor barre is closer to traditional strength work, the moves here are executed with grace- not because it looks better, but because it requires more control (the fact that it does look better, though, does add to the enjoyment).  Don't let anyone tell you that this doesn't work your arms as well.  My arms- particularly my shoulders and triceps- were burning by the end. My favorite parts of all were the warmups and Reverence- we were dancing!As someone who's been practicing yoga and Pilates for a while, I can definitely see the influences in this workout (e.g., the Leg Darts on this video are otherwise known as Single Leg Pulls in Pilates, and there are some child's pose and cobras on this video that comes from yoga).  And I must agree with other reviewers, one could get lost without some familiarity with dance terms.  Most of my knowledge comes from the New Method series, and I was fine.  However, since they had the time to include Sarah Jessica Parker and the segment about the dancers, three minutes of dance terminology wouldn't have hurt.The video lost a star because of the lack of cueing.  I'm willing to let that go for most sections, but when I'm prone or bending to my shins as in Reverence, I need a little more guidance than &quot;move your body to the music&quot;.  Also, the dark lighting in some of the sections didn't enhance my experience for the floor barre.  It was difficult to see the position of the right foot for one of the exercises because of the lighting, but it was clear for the next foot.",4,This is what I've been looking for,1015804800,"03 11, 2002",2002,2433,"['past', 'year', 'half', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'workouts', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'quot', 'traditional', 'quot', 'aerobics', 'weight', 'training', ""'ve"", 'gravitated', 'yoga', 'emphasis', 'breathing', 'flexibility', 'overall', 'thorough', 'workout', 'Pilates', 'emphasis', 'core', 'strength', ""'ve"", 'achieved', 'lot', 'fitness', 'goals', 'still', 'have', 'nagging', 'feeling', ""'m"", 'not', 'quot', 'going', 'anywhere', 'quot', 'routines-', 'exercise', 'just', 'sake', 'exercise', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sit', 'right', 'end', 'started', 'using', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'New', 'Method', 'series', 'addition', 'dance', 'training', 'feel', 'more', 'functional', ""'ve"", 'found', 'wishing', 'was', 'more', 'dance', 'series.Enter', 'video', 'love', 'leg', 'work', 'best', ""'ve"", 'done', 'When', 'plie', 'tendu', 'feel', 'not', 'only', ""'m"", 'getting', 'good', 'leg', 'workout', 'also', ""'m"", 'dancing', 'floor', 'barre', 'closer', 'traditional', 'strength', 'work', 'moves', 'here', 'are', 'executed', 'grace-', 'not', 'better', 'more', 'control', 'fact', 'look', 'better', 'add', 'enjoyment', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'tell', ""n't"", 'work', 'arms', 'well', 'arms-', 'particularly', 'shoulders', 'triceps-', 'were', 'burning', 'end', 'favorite', 'parts', 'were', 'warmups', 'Reverence-', 'were', 'dancing', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'while', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'influences', 'workout', 'e.g.', 'Leg', 'Darts', 'video', 'are', 'otherwise', 'known', 'Single', 'Leg', 'Pulls', 'Pilates', 'are', 'child', 'pose', 'cobras', 'video', 'yoga', 'must', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'one', 'could', 'get', 'lost', 'familiarity', 'dance', 'terms', 'Most', 'knowledge', 'New', 'Method', 'series', 'was', 'fine', 'However', 'had', 'time', 'include', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'segment', 'dancers', 'three', 'minutes', 'dance', 'terminology', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt.The', 'video', 'lost', 'star', 'lack', 'cueing', ""'m"", 'willing', 'let', 'go', 'most', 'sections', 'when', ""'m"", 'prone', 'bending', 'shins', 'Reverence', 'need', 'little', 'more', 'guidance', 'quot', 'move', 'body', 'music', 'quot', 'Also', 'dark', 'lighting', 'sections', 'did', ""n't"", 'enhance', 'experience', 'floor', 'barre', 'was', 'difficult', 'see', 'position', 'right', 'foot', 'one', 'exercises', 'lighting', 'was', 'clear', 'next', 'foot']",New York City Ballet Workout VHS

I have arthritis and I found it helpful in working out some of the stiffness I experience in the morning. It is somewhat aerobically challenging, but this video really does work on strengthening muscles all over the body. I find it challenging to hold my arms up the whole time in the ballet positions for some of the exercises. It is definitely challenging for me, who has never taken ballet, to do repetitive tendus and degages. I noticed my posture feels better all day after I do this tape. Doing the ballet exercises also makes me feel more graceful as well. The workout can be done barefoot or with dancer aerobic shoes.  The dancers are shown with and without shoes.  I enjoyed learning the ballet terms and the classical music is a refreshing change from the usual exercise video soundtracks. Peter Martins instructs the class in a easy to follow, soothing voiceover. This is a good tape to buy if you have always wanted to take a ballet class but never did. The tape features short bios on each dancer, (four of them,) after the workout.

Although it was difficult to follow at times, I found that I still enjoyed doing it, even when I knew that I looked nothing like the dancers on my screen.  There were two male and two female dancers dressed in workout clothing; at times they were wearing shoes and at other times not, but this was not explained.  An accented voice gives voice-over instructions, although these are often pretty minimal and the cueing is poor.  The music is classical.  The workout itself broke down into 17 sections as follows:1-3:  Three short warm up sessions.  #2 especially had some complicated choreography, but the warm ups were pretty easy overall.4:  Stretches.5:  Abs.  This is mainly traditional crunches.6:  Floor Barre 1.  This moves on to some nice leg stretches for things and buttocks.7:  Floor Barre 2.  This part continues with butt and inner thighs work then moves on to some Pilates-like exercises.8:  Floor Barre 3.  These exercises are for upper back and chest, including push-ups; it was hard to keep an eye on the screen.9:  Pli&eacute;s.10:  Tendu.11:  D&eacute;gag&eacute;--basically lifting your toe off the floor.12:  Pass&eacute;--similar but lifting knee.13:  Front Attitude--balance moves on one leg.14:  Grand Battemant Front--leg lifts to the front.15:  Arabesque Raises--similar lifts to the back with some balance work.16:  Little jumps--moving from pli&eacute;s to toe raises to small jumps; the instruction is especially poor in this section.17:  Reverence--this means ""bow,"" and it's a stretching and relaxation sectin that includes yoga-like bends and lunges.  The voice-over says to ""just follow the dancers,"" but again, it's kind of hard to see the screen from some positions.Overall, I found this to be a fun little change of pace; it's doable for anyone with some basic coordination and flexibility.",4,"Fun and unique, but a little tough to follow.",1031270400,"09 6, 2002",2002,1912,"['different', 'kind', 'workout', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'dancer', 'do', 'was', 'difficult', 'follow', 'times', 'found', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'doing', 'even', 'when', 'knew', 'looked', 'nothing', 'dancers', 'screen', 'were', 'two', 'male', 'two', 'female', 'dancers', 'dressed', 'workout', 'clothing', 'times', 'were', 'wearing', 'shoes', 'other', 'times', 'not', 'was', 'not', 'explained', 'accented', 'voice', 'voice-over', 'instructions', 'are', 'often', 'pretty', 'minimal', 'cueing', 'poor', 'music', 'classical', 'workout', 'broke', 'down', '17', 'sections', 'follows:1-3', 'Three', 'short', 'warm', 'up', 'sessions', '2', 'especially', 'had', 'complicated', 'choreography', 'warm', 'ups', 'were', 'pretty', 'easy', 'overall.4', 'Stretches.5', 'Abs', 'mainly', 'traditional', 'crunches.6', 'Floor', 'Barre', '1', 'nice', 'leg', 'stretches', 'things', 'buttocks.7', 'Floor', 'Barre', '2', 'part', 'butt', 'inner', 'thighs', 'work', 'then', 'moves', 'Pilates-like', 'exercises.8', 'Floor', 'Barre', '3', 'exercises', 'are', 'upper', 'back', 'chest', 'including', 'push-ups', 'was', 'hard', 'keep', 'eye', 'screen.9', 'Pli', 'eacute', 's.10', 'Tendu.11', 'D', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'basically', 'lifting', 'toe', 'floor.12', 'Pass', 'eacute', 'similar', 'lifting', 'knee.13', 'Front', 'Attitude', 'balance', 'moves', 'one', 'leg.14', 'Grand', 'Battemant', 'Front', 'leg', 'lifts', 'front.15', 'Arabesque', 'similar', 'lifts', 'back', 'balance', 'work.16', 'Little', 'jumps', 'moving', 'pli', 'eacute', 's', 'toe', 'raises', 'small', 'jumps', 'instruction', 'especially', 'poor', 'section.17', 'Reverence', 'bow', 'stretching', 'relaxation', 'sectin', 'yoga-like', 'bends', 'lunges', 'voice-over', 'just', 'follow', 'dancers', 'again', 'kind', 'hard', 'see', 'screen', 'positions.Overall', 'found', 'be', 'fun', 'little', 'change', 'pace', 'doable', 'anyone', 'basic', 'coordination', 'flexibility']",New York City Ballet Workout VHS

It's 1 hours long and it's divided in 17 sections, each focusing on specific movements/muscles. All exercises are performed with beautiful classical music in the background.The video contains a warm-up, lower-body stretches, abdominal exercises, and then &quot;floor barre&quot; (which are basically middle and lower body toning exercises), upper body and back toning and strengthening exercises; then you have several sections that include ballet movements, and then a cool-down.This video is ideal if you want to shape your body and sculpt your muscles without &quot;puffing them up&quot;: I never liked those hard, bulging muscles! I like better lean, long muscles like these dancers have. As one of the dancers observes, the NYC ballet dancers' bodies are different from other ballet dancers, and they truly are: these dancers have very beautiful, athletic bodies, rather than just being very thin like most ballet dancers.Another dancer says that ballet is a very athletic discipline, but most people don't notice that, because the bodies of the dancers are developed nicely and they move gracefully: we all know ballet is characterized by elegant moves and great posture and balance, and who wouldn't want that?

They have bodies that Michelangelo could not do justice to, but in this video they look as lovely as one of those medical texts showing starving children in stark black and white. Other people have said how much they liked the black and white effect, but I think it was a terrible choice and wish they might have integrated just a little color.Also, it seems someone threatened to shred the dancers tutus if they smiled even once during the filming because never have I seen four people so determined to keep their faces a mask of boredom.2) David Martins is no Denise Austin (okay, that can be good sometimes, but not in an exercise video). It is obvious that he doesn't use these sorts of videos very often, because he doesn't seem to know that the purpose of the narrator is to help the viewer follow along. He seems to prefer letting you figure it out on your own.3) He never explains a lot of the ballet terminology. If you are a dancer, you'll be fine when he tells you to releve, tendu and plie. If your whole experience with ballet is that your mom dragged you to the Nutcracker when you were five, you might be a little lost.4)The music really is lovely, but not very invigorating. The steps themselves are not very exciting, but rather boring. Some exercise routines leave you pumped and ready for the day. Not so with this tape. I find the reverence (the cool-down at the end) to be the most fun of the whole tape. Otherwise it's just repetition.5) He has you do tendus with flexed foot, which as a dancer, bothers me extremely. If you are trying to learn ballet, you should always do tendus with very pointed feet and I think showing them flexed, especially for a beginner, can foster a bad habit.What redeeming qualities does this video have?1) The interviews with the dancers at the end of the tape are an interesting view into the life of a professional dancer.2) During the interviews, they show clips of the dancers actually dancing instead of boringly working out. In these clips they look happy, engaged, beautiful. If only the whole thing had been like that.3) The exercises will help develop leg, abdominal and buttocks muscles as well as flexibility, if you can stay awake.",1,Don't watch this video before operating heavy equipment,1010707200,"01 11, 2002",2002,2451,"['purchased', 'video', '6', 'months', 'ago', 'have', 'used', 'several', 'times', 'here', 'are', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'it:1', 'take', 'most', 'beaufiul', 'dancers', 'world', 'put', 'bike', 'shorts', 'exercise', 'bras', 'bleakest', 'set', 'history', 'videos', 'have', 'bodies', 'Michelangelo', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'video', 'look', 'as', 'lovely', 'one', 'medical', 'texts', 'showing', 'starving', 'children', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'Other', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'black', 'white', 'effect', 'think', 'was', 'terrible', 'choice', 'wish', 'might', 'have', 'integrated', 'just', 'little', 'color.Also', 'someone', 'threatened', 'shred', 'dancers', 'tutus', 'smiled', 'even', 'once', 'filming', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'four', 'people', 'so', 'determined', 'keep', 'mask', 'boredom.2', 'David', 'Martins', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'okay', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'sometimes', 'not', 'exercise', 'video', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'use', 'sorts', 'videos', 'very', 'often', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'purpose', 'narrator', 'help', 'viewer', 'follow', 'along', 'prefer', 'letting', 'figure', 'out', 'own.3', 'never', 'lot', 'ballet', 'terminology', 'are', 'dancer', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine', 'when', 'releve', 'tendu', 'plie', 'whole', 'experience', 'ballet', 'mom', 'dragged', 'Nutcracker', 'when', 'were', 'five', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'lost.4', 'music', 'really', 'lovely', 'not', 'very', 'invigorating', 'steps', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'exciting', 'rather', 'boring', 'exercise', 'routines', 'leave', 'pumped', 'ready', 'day', 'Not', 'so', 'tape', 'find', 'reverence', 'cool-down', 'end', 'be', 'most', 'fun', 'whole', 'tape', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'repetition.5', 'do', 'tendus', 'flexed', 'foot', 'dancer', 'bothers', 'extremely', 'are', 'trying', 'learn', 'ballet', 'should', 'always', 'do', 'tendus', 'very', 'pointed', 'feet', 'think', 'showing', 'flexed', 'especially', 'beginner', 'can', 'foster', 'bad', 'habit.What', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'video', 'have', '1', 'interviews', 'dancers', 'end', 'tape', 'are', 'interesting', 'view', 'life', 'professional', 'dancer.2', 'interviews', 'show', 'clips', 'dancers', 'actually', 'dancing', 'instead', 'boringly', 'working', 'out', 'clips', 'look', 'happy', 'engaged', 'beautiful', 'only', 'whole', 'thing', 'had', 'been', 'that.3', 'exercises', 'will', 'help', 'develop', 'leg', 'abdominal', 'buttocks', 'muscles', 'as', 'well', 'flexibility', 'can', 'stay', 'awake']",New York City Ballet Workout VHS
