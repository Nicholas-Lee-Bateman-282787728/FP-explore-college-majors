In 1917, there is little to be happy about in the Wright household in West Yorkshire, England. Polly (Phoebe Nicholls) and her 12-year-old daughter Elsie (Florence Hoath) are still grieving over the death of Elsie's younger brother, and Polly's niece Frances (Elizabeth Earl) has come to stay with them after her father was declared missing in action during World War I. Polly longs for some sort of proof that there is a life beyond our own, while the two girls ardently believe in fairies and enthusiastically study legend and lore. One day, Elsie and Frances produce photographs of fairies that they claim were playing in their garden; Polly believes that they are real, and soon the snapshots attract international attention. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole), author of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries and a confirmed spiritualist, declares the photos ""as genuine as the King's beard,"" while illusionist Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel), who has devoted much time and energy to exposing phony mediums and psychics, takes a more cynical view, though he too is eventually convinced that the fairies are real. While Fairy Tale: A True Story presents the appearance of the fairies as fact, analysis of the photographs proved them to be fakes (especially after the same fairies were discovered as illustrations in a children's book published before the photos were taken). The real-life Elsie Wright admitted late in life that the fairy photos were a hoax performed as a ""little joke"" and that she was always surprised that so many people believed .This is yet another of the many  beautiful  sentimental movies and is one you will really  enjoy!",5,YOU WILL BELIEVE!!,1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,1767,"['Two', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'believe', 'fairies', 'are', 'real', 'attempt', 'prove', 'world', 'drama', 'based', 'actual', 'events', '1917', 'little', 'be', 'happy', 'Wright', 'household', 'West', 'Yorkshire', 'England', 'Polly', 'Phoebe', 'Nicholls', '12-year-old', 'daughter', 'Elsie', 'Florence', 'Hoath', 'are', 'still', 'grieving', 'death', 'Elsie', 'younger', 'brother', 'Polly', 'niece', 'Frances', 'Elizabeth', 'Earl', 'come', 'stay', 'father', 'was', 'declared', 'missing', 'action', 'World', 'War', 'I.', 'Polly', 'longs', 'sort', 'proof', 'life', 'own', 'two', 'girls', 'ardently', 'believe', 'fairies', 'enthusiastically', 'study', 'legend', 'lore', 'One', 'day', 'Elsie', 'Frances', 'produce', 'photographs', 'fairies', 'claim', 'were', 'playing', 'garden', 'Polly', 'are', 'real', 'soon', 'snapshots', 'attract', 'international', 'attention', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'author', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'mysteries', 'confirmed', 'spiritualist', 'photos', 'as', 'genuine', 'King', 'beard', 'illusionist', 'Harry', 'Houdini', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'who', 'devoted', 'much', 'time', 'energy', 'exposing', 'phony', 'mediums', 'psychics', 'more', 'cynical', 'view', 'too', 'eventually', 'convinced', 'fairies', 'are', 'real', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'True', 'Story', 'appearance', 'fairies', 'fact', 'analysis', 'photographs', 'proved', 'be', 'fakes', 'especially', 'same', 'fairies', 'were', 'discovered', 'illustrations', 'children', 'book', 'published', 'photos', 'were', 'taken', 'real-life', 'Elsie', 'Wright', 'admitted', 'late', 'life', 'fairy', 'photos', 'were', 'hoax', 'performed', 'little', 'joke', 'was', 'always', 'surprised', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'believed', '.This', 'yet', 'many', 'beautiful', 'sentimental', 'movies', 'one', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy']",N/A

437114,AX2SQL63A5CMV,6304834039,"Andrew Dobson ""AKA 'Tom Preston""","[5, 6]","Many reviewers give this movie high praises for originality, but since it's not the typical children's type of story are uncertain if they should give it a 4 or a 5 rating.This movie has no evil villians trying to ensnare the poor faries and capture the little girls. There are no heroic leads who come in and set everything right. It is simply about living and believing in what most cannot.The film follows the story of Elsie Wright and Frances Griffith, two girls who want to prove to their unbelieving mother that faries do exsist. Their photographs, however, get out of controle and soon the entire nation is in an uproar. The two girls must find a way to stop the commotion while not breaking their promise to never reveal the faries' secrets.This movie is very well done and superbly acted. The two girls are great actors (not many child actors are!) and as a sherlock fan i am proud of Peter O' Tool's portrayal of Sir Author Conan Doyal. The addition of Huddini in the mix adds for a delightful drama.The movie doesn't sugar-coat anything, and the question about what happens when children grow up is ever present. It is a sad-sad world where we are forced to become adults and stop beliving in fantasy and magic.I would like to dispell alot of the claims of ""bad computer animation"" in this movie. ... For one thing, Computer Animation wasn't used to portray any of the fairies except the mermaid one. The rest were real actors. I think that the little amount of footage of the faries on screen allowed the filmakers to spend more time on them and create a much more believable scene than anything done in recent years (with the exception of ""Hook"")",5,A unique and enchanting movie,1036972800,"11 11, 2002",2002,1659,"['Many', 'reviewers', 'give', 'movie', 'high', 'praises', 'originality', 'not', 'typical', 'children', 'type', 'story', 'are', 'uncertain', 'should', 'give', '4', '5', 'rating.This', 'movie', 'evil', 'villians', 'trying', 'ensnare', 'poor', 'faries', 'capture', 'little', 'girls', 'are', 'heroic', 'leads', 'who', 'come', 'set', 'everything', 'right', 'simply', 'living', 'believing', 'what', 'most', 'can', 'not', '.The', 'film', 'story', 'Elsie', 'Wright', 'Frances', 'Griffith', 'two', 'girls', 'who', 'want', 'prove', 'unbelieving', 'mother', 'do', 'exsist', 'Their', 'photographs', 'however', 'get', 'controle', 'soon', 'entire', 'nation', 'uproar', 'two', 'girls', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'stop', 'commotion', 'not', 'breaking', 'promise', 'never', 'reveal', 'faries', 'secrets.This', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'superbly', 'acted', 'two', 'girls', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'not', 'many', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'sherlock', 'fan', 'i', 'am', 'proud', 'Peter', 'O', 'Tool', 'portrayal', 'Sir', 'Author', 'Conan', 'Doyal', 'addition', 'Huddini', 'mix', 'delightful', 'drama.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'sugar-coat', 'anything', 'question', 'what', 'when', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'ever', 'present', 'sad-sad', 'world', 'where', 'are', 'forced', 'become', 'adults', 'stop', 'beliving', 'fantasy', 'magic.I', 'would', 'like', 'dispell', 'alot', 'claims', 'bad', 'computer', 'animation', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'Computer', 'Animation', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'portray', 'fairies', 'mermaid', 'one', 'rest', 'were', 'real', 'actors', 'think', 'little', 'amount', 'footage', 'faries', 'screen', 'allowed', 'filmakers', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'create', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'scene', 'anything', 'done', 'recent', 'years', 'exception', 'Hook']",N/A

I decided when I saw it first to just go with it and not try to decide. Later I read an interview with one of the little girls involved, now grown old.Elsie Wright (Florence Hoath) is 12 years old. Her mother, Polly Wright (Phoebe Nichols) is still seriously grieving for her son Joseph, who died some time ago. Papa Arthur (Paul McGann) tries to get her to think about something else, to little effect.Then Frances Griffiths (Elizabeth Earl), Polly's dead sister's child, comes to stay with them while her father is missing in the war -- World War One. The girls quickly discover that they both have an abiding interest in fairies, as did Elsie's brother Joseph. They go down by the beck (at the bottom of the garden) against Polly's orders and there Frances sees an aquatic fairy rather like a mermaid (or merman) with dragonfly-type wings.Arthur tries to talk her out of it, but Polly goes to a meeting of the Theosophical Society to hear about angels and other magical beings. Meanwhile, the girls have ""borrowed"" Arthur's camera and return with pictures of fairies. When he develops them, Arthur questions the girls on how they made the pictures, and they insist the pictures are real.When Polly comes home and sees the pictures, it is just after having been to the Theosophical Society lecture, where a soldier told of seeing three beings, which he figured were angels, who protected him and his squad from the Germans. So she's primed to believe the pictures are real, partly because she is sure her daughter would not lie to her.She gives copies of the photos to Mr. Bradford of the Theosophical Society, and he is excited. He shows them to a photographer who specializes in trick photography, who insists they are single shot amateur photos. He also says that when the photos were taken, the fairies' wings were moving.Bradford gives them to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole), who shows them to Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel). Houdini is skeptical, but Sir Arthur makes arrangements for him and Houdini and several other people to visit the Wrights and talk to the girls.Well, to make a long story a little shorter, Sir Arthur publishes the photos and changes the girls' names. However, it doesn't take long for the press to discover who they are and where they live. So the girls are famous, and are invited to London to meet famous people, talk to people in hospitals, etc.There's more, and I hope I have not ruined it for you already. The girls are cute, the fairies are exquisite, and Doyle and Houdini are quite believable. Still, I think it is stretching it a bit to subtitle it ""A True Story.""

Joseph was the original believer of the fairies; he spoke of them drew them and passed on his love to his sister.  Shortly before his death his parents felt it was time for him to grow up and forbad him to talk of the fairies.  Frances still walks down to their creek in the hopes to see the fairies that seemed to have left with her brother.When Elsie's father goes missing in France during WWI, she leaves Africa to join her cousin Frances, and her aunt Polly and uncle Arthur, in England.  Elsie is the breath of fresh air this family desperately needs.  Elsie shares Frances' love of fairies and refuses to believe that they left when Joseph passed away.  It isn't long before both the girls discover their winged friends.While Polly and Arthur both try to dissuade the girls from their beliefs in fairies, Polly at the same time is searching for proof of Angels.  She is seeking some comfort and peace with her son's death.  That's when Elsie suggests that she and Frances photograph the fairies to help her aunt believe.When their photographs reach the public, these two little girls embark on a magnificent journey of discovery, skepticism and faith; making believers out of the biggest doubters.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini play intricate roles in the girls' lives.I watched this movie with my 4 year old son and husband; I was concerned it was going to be a little too old for my son, and a little too young for my husband.  We all loved it. The acting, by everyone, is superb and the two little girls are enchanting.  This movie was beyond magical, beyond beautiful, beyond heartwarming.  It is a powerful tale of faith, joy, innocence and fantasy.  More importantly it shows us how believing in something, no matter how fanciful, can help to mend and bring peace to wounded hearts.So the next time you walk in your yard or work in your gardens, be on the lookout for your fairies...

Edwards,"[3, 3]","As a Peter O'Toole fan I ran across this film and held it in my basket for close to a year, until I finally purchased it--and I am very pleased with my choice.  My decision was based primarily on the Wikipedia introduction:""Fairy Tale: A True Story"" is a 1997 film from Paramount Pictures, very loosely based on the legend of the Cottingley Fairies [See Wikipedia for the ""real"" story]. It was directed by Charles Sturridge and starred Peter O'Toole and Harvey Keitel, with Florence Hoath and Elizabeth Earl as the girls, Elsie and Francis, Phoebe Nicholls and Paul McGann as the parents, Polly and Arthur Wright, and a brief cameo at the end of the film by Mel Gibson. Much of it was shot on location in the Cottingley area. The cinematography is by Michael Coulter the art direction is by Sam Riley.""I am always interested in movies based on ""real"" stories, and having O'Toole, Keitel, and Gibson in it was a clincher for me to go ahead and buy the movie (it is not available for rent in Helena; and on-line rentals get damaged by the USPS).While my children are grown and I had to watch the film by myself, I was fully engaged in the film the entire time.  My only complaint--as I have with so many movies--is that the sound track is too loud for me to distinctly hear the voices; especially with the ""English"" accents.  While O'Toole's performance, as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, was his up to his usual excellence, at times he seemed like he was not always ""into"" the role--almost distant.  On the other hand, Harvey Keitel, as the audacious Harry Houdini, was an absolute joy to watch--he was no ""heavy"" in this film.  The special effects were nicely integrated, and added to the story of Elsie Wrigth (Florence Hoath) and her cousin Frances Griffiths (Elizabeth Earl), whose faith in ""guardian angels,"" ""fairies,"" and such ""children's"" fancies restores hope to Frances' grieving parents over the death of her brother, to a war torn England, and to the young Elsie that her father will return.  The real surprise performance was the brief cameo at the end of the film by Mel Gibson, as Elsie's returning father.  Gibson is spectacular at ""bring home"" or delivering the perfect tone to such roles.  It was like: ""Can this get any better?""Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

Melillo ""gloriana""","[6, 6]","I personally did not find this to be a children's film at all (though none of its contents are unsuitable for the young.) There are great liberties taken with the actual 'Cottingley fairies' incident, and one would think, from the film version, that the wee folk were seen fluttering through the air by young and old, where, actually, the photographs are so clearly a hoax that one must attribute the dramatic licence to a desire to stress believing.For this is a rather tragic tale (in no way upsetting, but very sad) of those, such as Lucy's mother and Arthur Conan Doyle, who are suffering from deep bereavement, and who are seeking signs of contact with their deceased children. Believing in fairies - or anything beyond that is in the realm of the magical - is a means of coping for them. Sir Arthur, a man of great imagination and intelligence, is an ambiguous figure in this situation, needing the comfort of Victorian theosophy and other things magical as a means to cope with tragedy.I shall admit I enjoyed the entire spectacle. Though it is difficult to believe that the public ever accepted the fairy photographs as real, it was nice to relax for a few hours, contemplating just what it would be like for people to look for a benevolent power, hidden but sympathetic. The recent Victorian era (during which fairies, unlike some of Shakespeare's, could be rather more troublesome than pleasant) had left the Cottingley group with a fascination with the romantic, combined with an optimism (which would not survive two world wars) which it is rather moving to recall.I would be inclined to doubt that young children would be much attracted by Fairy Tale. The fairies, who presumably would capture their interest most, rarely and briefly appear. For those who are old enough to grasp anything of the complexity of the story, it is an interesting and warm means for reflection on how attempts to return to childhood in some way can sustain us in times of grief.",4,Enjoyable film,1161993600,"10 28, 2006",2006,1969,"['personally', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'be', 'children', 'film', 'none', 'contents', 'are', 'unsuitable', 'young', 'are', 'great', 'liberties', 'taken', 'actual', ""'Cottingley"", 'fairies', 'incident', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'version', 'wee', 'folk', 'were', 'seen', 'fluttering', 'air', 'young', 'old', 'where', 'actually', 'photographs', 'are', 'so', 'clearly', 'hoax', 'one', 'must', 'attribute', 'dramatic', 'licence', 'desire', 'stress', 'believing.For', 'rather', 'tragic', 'tale', 'way', 'upsetting', 'very', 'sad', 'such', 'Lucy', 'mother', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'who', 'are', 'suffering', 'deep', 'bereavement', 'who', 'are', 'seeking', 'signs', 'contact', 'deceased', 'children', 'Believing', 'fairies', 'anything', 'realm', 'magical', 'means', 'coping', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'man', 'great', 'imagination', 'intelligence', 'ambiguous', 'figure', 'situation', 'needing', 'comfort', 'Victorian', 'theosophy', 'other', 'things', 'magical', 'means', 'cope', 'tragedy.I', 'shall', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'entire', 'spectacle', 'difficult', 'believe', 'public', 'ever', 'accepted', 'fairy', 'photographs', 'real', 'was', 'nice', 'relax', 'few', 'hours', 'contemplating', 'just', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'people', 'look', 'benevolent', 'power', 'hidden', 'sympathetic', 'recent', 'Victorian', 'era', 'fairies', 'Shakespeare', 'could', 'be', 'rather', 'more', 'troublesome', 'pleasant', 'had', 'left', 'Cottingley', 'group', 'fascination', 'romantic', 'combined', 'optimism', 'would', 'not', 'survive', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'rather', 'moving', 'recall.I', 'would', 'be', 'inclined', 'doubt', 'young', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'attracted', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'fairies', 'who', 'presumably', 'would', 'capture', 'interest', 'most', 'rarely', 'briefly', 'appear', 'who', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'grasp', 'anything', 'complexity', 'story', 'interesting', 'warm', 'means', 'reflection', 'how', 'attempts', 'return', 'childhood', 'way', 'can', 'sustain', 'times', 'grief']",N/A

Life may not trudge precisely through Shakespeare's seven ages, but we humans are given to know what we can expect during our assigned years on Earth. Cause and effect;  expectations and responsibilities; roles to play; rules to abide by;  moralities to honor; standards to uphold; sickness and death; physical and  social limitations; genes, hormones, and DNA; crusades to march and wars to  wage; standards to achieve; and loyalties we're assigned - all to be  accepted with a stiff upper lip, no matter the bent of our hearts.Ah,  but just at the edge of our view there's magic. Magic gives life another  dimension, a new and fulfilling warmth and excitement; rules and roles and  all are suspended. We can fly, maybe ... if we want, or at least thrill in  the witness of others who can. Tinkerbell did exist, you know: if not in my  own original vision, then through the vision of J. M. Barrie. As a child I  clapped along with everyone else so that Tinkerbell would live. As an adult  I know (I think) that Tinkerbell only existed on Mr. Barrie's printed  script, because I know (I think) that fairies aren't real. But even as an  adult, out there at the edge of my view, could it be? It scares me to  hope.Elsie and Frances knew what reality was in their early twentieth  century world. Eight year-old Frances' mother was dead; her father was  missing in a terrible war; and she had to travel thousands of miles to live  in the home of her cousin, the last leg of her trip on a train that she  shared with wounded and maimed soldiers returning from the front lines.  Elsie's brother had recently died of pneumonia (in those days pneumonia was  almost a death warrant), and both her parents were struggling with that  reality. Elsie at twelve also faced the reality that &quot;in six months  time, she'll be able to start work at the mill safe in the knowledge that  she has a job for life.&quot;So they seek and find fairies in the beck  (a small stream near their house) and take pictures of them - and so begins  the story. Are the fairies real? Or are the girls merely little scam  artists perpetrating a grand hoax? But why on Earth would two sweet kids do  such a thing?In my judgment, this is as perfect a movie as I've ever  seen. The story is fascinating and complete. The images are breathtaking.  The music, by Zbigniew Preisner, charms. The cast, which includes Peter  O'Toole, Harvey Keitel, Paul McGann, and Phoebe Nichols, is outstanding.  Elizabeth Earl is the perfect personification of the bright, precocious -  and wise Frances. Florence Hoath plays Elsie with an understated grace  that's absolutely awesome.I recommend this movie to young and old. You  skeptics?

Houdini, who exposed charlatans and spiritualists, recognized that the two young girls got swept up into a sensationalistic story over an innocent prank, while Doyle, grieving over the loss of his son in WWI, lost the objectivity of his rigorously logical alter ego, Sherlock Holmes.It was the grief and suffering caused by a horrible war that sparked the hysteria over the photographs, with people reaching out for something pure, innocent and beautiful. Houdini, as well as the filmmakers, recognized that, and artfully refrained from bulldozing over innocence with the sharp edges of fact.One of the daughters of the late conductor Bruno Walter said in an interview that their father never allowed them backstage at an opera until they were grown.

In the 1980s the two young girls, by now elderly women, confessed that they had made the whole thing up using paper cut outs for the fairies.This film has some very beautiful scenes of the English countryside and depicts the storyline romantically and somewhat exagerratedly, but does a good job of linking the desire to believe in fairies to the stress so many people were under during World War I.

Gelwasser,"[107, 108]","I saw ""Fairy Tale - A True Story"", when it had it's theatrical release and I was utterly charmed and moved by this wonderful movie. I am so glad that it has finally been released to the DVD format.The story is based upon the true life events surrounding the famous and sensational 'Cottingly fairies photographs'.The film takes place during the dark days of WWI Britain. A young Elsie Wright (Florence Hoath) is sent off to live with relatives, because her father is 'missing in action'.Elsie becomes fast friends with her twelve year old, cousin, Frances (Elizebeth Earl) both of whom seem to have a playful fascination with the subject of fairies. One day the girls borrow an old camera and go off to a local brook to take pictures. When the photographs are later developed, they show images of what seem to be real, live fairies!Through a series of events the photographs fall into the famous hands of Sherlock Holmes Writer, Sir Author Conan Doyle (Pete O'Toole) and Magician & Escape Artist, Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel). Doyle publishes the photographs in a national magazine and causes a sensation throughout the country.Are the pictures real or did these two young girls pull off the hoax of the century? The movie puts it's own twist on the facts and attempts to come up with some very interesting answers.Director, Charles Sturridge and Screen Writer, Ernie Contreras have created a magical and moving film about the subject of faith. Sometimes if you believe in something hard enough, maby it can come true. This is found throughout the film. It applies to everything from the belief in the unseen (such as fairies, spirits of love ones), the return of a father, or even the faith needed to win a brutal war.The acting in this movie is splendid.I especially like the casting of the two girls (Florence Hoath & Elizebeth Earl). Even in the unusual situations, that occur, they both act like normal, everyday, children. Not a false note in their performances.The film's special effects are also great. They are well done and realistic (flying miniature fairies), yet do not overwhelm the story.This is greatly aided by cinematographer , Michael Coulter's beautiful photography, which highlights both the colors found in nature (the woods and brook) and the light and darkness of urban, Victorian England.

Electricity and photography are new sciences, and ""Spiritualistic"" fraud abounds. When Arthur Conan Doyle investigates and sanctions the authenticity of the story, the country accepts it as genuine. Like all good fairy tales, the movie has a message that underlies the fantasy elements; the human race  frequently finds itself in need of reasons to believe in the ability to transcend pain and death.  As Polly Wright, the mother and aunt of the girls, confides in her husband, she is afraid to believe that the pictures are real, and afraid not to.The cast of Fairy Tale was well chosen, from luminaries such as Peter O'Toole as Doyle, to newcomers  Florence Hoath and Elizabeth Earl as the budding photographers.  Not a single performance is poor or overdone. Beautifully filmed in soft colors, with appealing special effects, it evokes life in rural England nearly  century ago.

While Fairy Tale only vaguely resembles the true story of the young woman and her little cousin who caused such a stir with the famous photographs, it stands on its own as a story of shared mystery.The events took place at a time when Western civilisation desperately needed to believe in something beyond itself. The Theosophical movement, forerunner of today's New Age religion, sought scientific proof of a dimension most of us do not see, which they considered non-material, but real. The invention of the telephone, telegraph and photography made it seem as though all sorts of heretofore unproveable things such as life after death could be scientifically (that is, empirically) demonstrated and chronicled. Spiritualist sessions were often called experiments for that very reason. Meanwhile, people like Harry Houdini, who desperately wanted to contact his beloved mother in the next life, kept a reality check by exposing the exploitation of this open-mindedness by phony mediums.Fairy Tale manages to convey not only some of the feelings of that period in history, but a personal sense of the magic and mystery created by the interweaving minds of two children amidst the natural beauty of a wondrous myth-drenched landscape. The sense of place is overwhelming, creating a longing in the viewer that must remain unfulfilled in the modern world where most of such fairy realms have been destroyed by encroaching development and sprawl. This is not a children's film, although it should by all means be shown to children. It will rest next to Heavenly Creatures on my video shelf, a reminder of possibilities.",4,"Not a ""family film"" in the modern sense....",1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,1814,"['am', 'dismayed', 'marketing', 'exquisite', 'jewel', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'words', 'invariably', 'mean', 'bland', 'dumbed-down', 'filled', 'alleged', 'values', 'lacking', 'real', 'content', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'only', 'vaguely', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'little', 'cousin', 'who', 'caused', 'stir', 'famous', 'photographs', 'own', 'story', 'shared', 'mystery.The', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'time', 'when', 'Western', 'civilisation', 'desperately', 'needed', 'believe', 'something', 'Theosophical', 'movement', 'forerunner', 'today', 'New', 'Age', 'religion', 'sought', 'scientific', 'proof', 'dimension', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'considered', 'non-material', 'real', 'invention', 'telephone', 'telegraph', 'photography', 'made', 'seem', 'sorts', 'heretofore', 'unproveable', 'things', 'such', 'life', 'death', 'could', 'be', 'scientifically', 'empirically', 'demonstrated', 'chronicled', 'Spiritualist', 'sessions', 'were', 'often', 'called', 'experiments', 'very', 'reason', 'Meanwhile', 'people', 'Harry', 'Houdini', 'who', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'contact', 'beloved', 'mother', 'next', 'life', 'kept', 'reality', 'check', 'exposing', 'exploitation', 'open-mindedness', 'phony', 'mediums.Fairy', 'Tale', 'convey', 'not', 'only', 'feelings', 'period', 'history', 'personal', 'sense', 'magic', 'mystery', 'created', 'interweaving', 'minds', 'two', 'children', 'natural', 'beauty', 'wondrous', 'myth-drenched', 'landscape', 'sense', 'place', 'overwhelming', 'creating', 'longing', 'viewer', 'must', 'remain', 'unfulfilled', 'modern', 'world', 'where', 'most', 'such', 'fairy', 'realms', 'have', 'been', 'destroyed', 'encroaching', 'development', 'sprawl', 'not', 'children', 'film', 'should', 'means', 'be', 'shown', 'children', 'will', 'rest', 'next', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'video', 'shelf', 'reminder', 'possibilities']",N/A
437152,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6304834039,Only-A-Child,"[1, 1]","""Masters of illusion never reveal their secrets"" says Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel) in the lyrical fantasy ''Fairytale--A True Story'' (1997). And pay attention to the things Houdini says like: ""Never try to fool children. They expect nothing and therefore see everything"", because his character exists to articulate the film's themes. These revolve around the need for many people to believe in the existence of spiritual concepts, the wisdom of not challenging these beliefs if they give sustenance, and how loss of the ability to see much that is hidden goes along with our loss of innocence.  The innocence is stressed early in the film when an 8 year-old girl seeks out a horribly scarred veteran on the train and gets ""her corporal's"" help to play a game of cat's cradle.In its best montage the film moves between, Houdini's fabled ""The Chinese Water Torture Cell"" illusion, a chess match, and the first-hand spiritual education of an investigative reporter.The film loosely documents the ""Cottingley fairies"" incident in 1917 when two English girls produced photographs that showed themselves in the presence of fairies. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (insert Sherlock Holmes here) published the photographs when he and various experts became convinced they were authentic. Many years later the girls would confess that they had faked all but one of the photos, but they continued to claim that their fairies actually exist.12-year-old Elsie Wright (Florence Hoath) and 8-year-old Frances Griffiths (Elizabeth Earl) are the girls. It is late in WW1 and Francis has come to live with her Aunt and Uncle because her father is missing in action on the front lines. The Wright's too are dealing with a recent loss as Elsie's brother has passed away. So both children and Mrs. Wright (Phoebe Nicholls) are primed for belief in the other world.Yes there are fairies, the viewer sees them when no people are around and we see them leaving the area when Doyle's revelations cause the property to be trampled by a hoard of both believers and skeptics.The production design and the special effects are impressive and the film is absorbing from scene to scene. The target audience is a little hard to pin down as the subject is geared to children but much of the story a bit confusing if you are not already familiar with historical figures like Houdini and Doyle. The film utilizes the tried and true device for connecting with children by giving them a story about young people who know stuff is real, even though adults don't get it.In the film the age gap between the two girls is slightly less than it was in real life, which gives their relationship a bit more believability. Even more impressive is how successful the director was in the subtle creation of two very distinct personalities. Elsie is shy and artistic. Frances is confident and social. Their interplay is the film's real strength; apparently the director sensed this dynamic and worked very hard in his acting for the camera direction of the two young actresses. He kept them in character and added behavioral elements they give their characters considerable depth and dimensionality.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",5,Highly Recommended,1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,3188,"['Masters', 'illusion', 'never', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'Harry', 'Houdini', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'lyrical', 'fantasy', 'Fairytale', 'True', 'Story', '1997', 'pay', 'attention', 'things', 'Houdini', 'Never', 'try', 'fool', 'children', 'expect', 'nothing', 'therefore', 'see', 'everything', 'character', 'articulate', 'film', 'themes', 'revolve', 'need', 'many', 'people', 'believe', 'existence', 'spiritual', 'concepts', 'wisdom', 'not', 'challenging', 'beliefs', 'give', 'sustenance', 'how', 'loss', 'ability', 'see', 'much', 'hidden', 'along', 'loss', 'innocence', 'innocence', 'stressed', 'early', 'film', 'when', '8', 'year-old', 'girl', 'out', 'horribly', 'scarred', 'veteran', 'train', 'corporal', 'help', 'play', 'game', 'cat', 'cradle.In', 'best', 'montage', 'film', 'moves', 'Houdini', 'fabled', 'Chinese', 'Water', 'Torture', 'Cell', 'illusion', 'chess', 'match', 'first-hand', 'spiritual', 'education', 'investigative', 'reporter.The', 'film', 'loosely', 'documents', 'Cottingley', 'fairies', 'incident', '1917', 'when', 'two', 'English', 'girls', 'produced', 'photographs', 'showed', 'presence', 'fairies', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'insert', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'here', 'published', 'photographs', 'when', 'various', 'experts', 'became', 'convinced', 'were', 'authentic', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'girls', 'would', 'confess', 'had', 'faked', 'one', 'photos', 'continued', 'claim', 'fairies', 'actually', 'exist.12-year-old', 'Elsie', 'Wright', 'Florence', 'Hoath', '8-year-old', 'Frances', 'Griffiths', 'Elizabeth', 'Earl', 'are', 'girls', 'late', 'WW1', 'Francis', 'come', 'live', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'father', 'missing', 'action', 'front', 'lines', 'Wright', 'too', 'are', 'dealing', 'recent', 'loss', 'Elsie', 'brother', 'passed', 'away', 'children', 'Mrs.', 'Wright', 'Phoebe', 'Nicholls', 'are', 'primed', 'belief', 'other', 'world.Yes', 'are', 'fairies', 'viewer', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'around', 'see', 'leaving', 'area', 'when', 'Doyle', 'revelations', 'cause', 'property', 'be', 'trampled', 'hoard', 'believers', 'skeptics.The', 'production', 'design', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'impressive', 'film', 'absorbing', 'scene', 'scene', 'target', 'audience', 'little', 'hard', 'pin', 'down', 'subject', 'geared', 'children', 'much', 'story', 'bit', 'confusing', 'are', 'not', 'already', 'familiar', 'historical', 'figures', 'Houdini', 'Doyle', 'film', 'tried', 'true', 'device', 'connecting', 'children', 'giving', 'story', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'stuff', 'real', 'even', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.In', 'film', 'age', 'gap', 'two', 'girls', 'slightly', 'less', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'relationship', 'bit', 'more', 'believability', 'Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'how', 'successful', 'director', 'was', 'subtle', 'creation', 'two', 'very', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'Elsie', 'shy', 'artistic', 'Frances', 'confident', 'social', 'interplay', 'film', 'real', 'strength', 'apparently', 'director', 'sensed', 'dynamic', 'worked', 'very', 'hard', 'acting', 'camera', 'direction', 'two', 'young', 'actresses', 'kept', 'character', 'added', 'behavioral', 'elements', 'give', 'characters', 'considerable', 'depth', 'dimensionality.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",N/A

It's unjustly a  &quot;sleeper&quot;, as it's easily the best written, performed and mounted  fantasy in quite some time. There isn't a false note in the entire  film-which is based on true events of almost a hundred years ago, involving  two young girls(very charming and real performances by the young  actresses)who apparently managed to take some candid photographs  of...fairies.  Famous then as now as the  creator of Sherlock Holmes, and  an avowed spiritualist, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle involves himself with the  girls(Peter O'Toole is wonderful, even if he looks nothing like the real  Sir Arthur), and tries to discover the truth of their story,as well as the  photographs.  You're never quite sure just where the film is going next,  and that's a plus, as it creates such a lovely mood getting there.  Although the budget can't have been large, it looks perfect-one of the few  period films of recent years to seem convincing.  And there's a special  treat in the performance of none other than Harvey Keitel-as Houdini!  In a  movie full of great performances, Keitel(believe it or not!)is a  standout-he IS Harry Houdini-a character the actor had always wanted to  play-and he's worked into the plot perfectly.

437158,A4FX5YCJA630V,6304834039,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[17, 19]","Don't let the title fool you - I think this movie is great, only not what some people might be expecting. Despite the title, the fairies themselves don't come into the movie much expect as a plot device - there are a few fleeting glimpses but not a word of dialouge spoken among them. So forget any ideas of fairy mischief-making, as the movie centres more around the topic of belief and faith, and the contriversy that arises from the two girls and their 'proof' in the existence of fairies. Therefore, only the thoughtful and patient (and rare!) breed of children will get much enjoyment from this movie - others I'm afraid will be simply bored.I have always been fascinated by the real story of the fairies in Cottingley Glen, and have copies of the photographs taken by Elsie Wright and Frances Griffith, two teenagers who claimed that the fairies and gnomes captured by their camera were in fact real. I have also read several conflicting stories on the resolution of these events - one resource told me the girls confessed that the photographs were fake, another that on their death-bed one of them swore they were real. And yet another - the editorial review claims the girl passed away without any confession one way or the other. In the movie version the fairies are obviously real beings, and yet the director cleverly slips in a scene illustrating how the 'real' pictures could have been created - the nasty reporter pins cut-out fairies to the desk top.The movie story is fairly straightforward, but with deep and serious undercurrents - Frances Griffith's father is missing in action during the war, and so travels to her older cousin Elsie Wright's home to wait out the fighting. Though the forest and river is populated by fairies, the Wright house however, is not such a happy place - Elsie and her parents are still mourning the loss of their son and brother Joseph. Arthur Wright (who had forbidden his son to have anything to do with fairies before he died) cannot even bring himself to speak his name, and Polly Wright gradually looses herself in the desparate hope of angels and fairies. To renew Polly's faith the two girls decide to photograph the fairies as proof to her that they do truly exist. Their plan works, but eager to share her new-found joy, Polly gives the pictures to a public speaker who releases them to the public, instantly making the girls celebrities. Also in the mix are well-known public figures Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole) a pawn to so-called psychics due to his desparate wish for his deceased son's spirit to communicate with him, and Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel) the famous escapist and magician who despite his disbelief in real magic, becomes the girls strongest supporter. And hang on a second...was that Mel Gibson turning up at the last moment as Frances's father?!The two child stars Florence Hoath and Elizabeth Earl are wonderful as the children struggling through the difficulties life throws at them, and the belief they uphold throughout it all - Frances is mischievious and cheerful, Elsie is serious and thoughtful, but the two of them form another theme that comes through: the inevitable truth that everyone must someday grow up (watch out for the cleverly inserted Peter Pan pantomine). Discussing the subject at night, Frances gives the lovelist reason as to why someone would *want* to grow up - ""I think I know what it means to be grownup. It's when you feel...what someone *else* feels.""All in all, though I like this movie enough to have it on tape, I feel that since the movie is mainly about having faith and belief in the unseen, it may have been a better idea not to have the fairies shown at all expect in the photographs - letting the viewer decide for themeselves whether they believe in fairies or not.",3,Is this movie for children or adults?,1031184000,"09 5, 2002",2002,3792,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'title', 'fool', 'think', 'movie', 'great', 'only', 'not', 'what', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'expecting', 'title', 'fairies', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'movie', 'much', 'expect', 'plot', 'device', 'are', 'few', 'fleeting', 'glimpses', 'not', 'word', 'dialouge', 'spoken', 'So', 'forget', 'ideas', 'fairy', 'mischief-making', 'movie', 'more', 'topic', 'belief', 'faith', 'contriversy', 'two', 'girls', ""'proof"", 'existence', 'fairies', 'Therefore', 'only', 'thoughtful', 'patient', 'rare', 'breed', 'children', 'will', 'get', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'others', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'will', 'be', 'simply', 'bored.I', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'real', 'story', 'fairies', 'Cottingley', 'Glen', 'have', 'copies', 'photographs', 'taken', 'Elsie', 'Wright', 'Frances', 'Griffith', 'two', 'teenagers', 'who', 'claimed', 'fairies', 'gnomes', 'captured', 'camera', 'were', 'fact', 'real', 'have', 'also', 'read', 'several', 'conflicting', 'stories', 'resolution', 'events', 'one', 'resource', 'told', 'girls', 'confessed', 'photographs', 'were', 'fake', 'death-bed', 'one', 'swore', 'were', 'real', 'yet', 'editorial', 'review', 'girl', 'passed', 'away', 'confession', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'movie', 'version', 'fairies', 'are', 'obviously', 'real', 'beings', 'yet', 'director', 'cleverly', 'slips', 'scene', 'illustrating', 'how', ""'real"", 'pictures', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'nasty', 'reporter', 'cut-out', 'fairies', 'desk', 'top.The', 'movie', 'story', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'deep', 'serious', 'undercurrents', 'Frances', 'Griffith', 'father', 'missing', 'action', 'war', 'so', 'travels', 'older', 'cousin', 'Elsie', 'Wright', 'home', 'wait', 'out', 'fighting', 'forest', 'river', 'populated', 'fairies', 'Wright', 'house', 'however', 'not', 'such', 'happy', 'place', 'Elsie', 'parents', 'are', 'still', 'mourning', 'loss', 'son', 'brother', 'Joseph', 'Arthur', 'Wright', 'who', 'had', 'forbidden', 'son', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'fairies', 'died', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'bring', 'speak', 'name', 'Polly', 'Wright', 'gradually', 'desparate', 'hope', 'angels', 'fairies', 'renew', 'Polly', 'faith', 'two', 'girls', 'decide', 'photograph', 'fairies', 'proof', 'do', 'truly', 'exist', 'plan', 'eager', 'share', 'new-found', 'joy', 'Polly', 'pictures', 'public', 'speaker', 'who', 'public', 'instantly', 'making', 'girls', 'celebrities', 'Also', 'mix', 'are', 'well-known', 'public', 'figures', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'pawn', 'so-called', 'psychics', 'due', 'desparate', 'wish', 'deceased', 'son', 'spirit', 'communicate', 'Harry', 'Houdini', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'famous', 'escapist', 'magician', 'who', 'disbelief', 'real', 'magic', 'girls', 'strongest', 'supporter', 'hang', 'second', 'was', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'turning', 'up', 'last', 'moment', 'Frances', 'father', 'two', 'child', 'stars', 'Florence', 'Hoath', 'Elizabeth', 'Earl', 'are', 'wonderful', 'children', 'struggling', 'difficulties', 'life', 'throws', 'belief', 'uphold', 'Frances', 'mischievious', 'cheerful', 'Elsie', 'serious', 'thoughtful', 'two', 'form', 'theme', 'inevitable', 'truth', 'everyone', 'must', 'someday', 'grow', 'up', 'watch', 'out', 'cleverly', 'inserted', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'pantomine', 'Discussing', 'subject', 'night', 'Frances', 'lovelist', 'reason', 'why', 'someone', 'would', '*want*', 'grow', 'up', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'grownup', 'when', 'feel', 'what', 'someone', '*else*', 'feels', 'like', 'movie', 'enough', 'have', 'tape', 'feel', 'movie', 'mainly', 'having', 'faith', 'belief', 'unseen', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'idea', 'not', 'have', 'fairies', 'shown', 'expect', 'photographs', 'letting', 'viewer', 'decide', 'themeselves', 'believe', 'fairies', 'not']",N/A

We have had many an occasion to view it, and yet we never tire of it at all.On the contrary, we thoroughly enjoy it, and long to view it again.Faeries and girls... Faery tales and stories, along with, especially girls, just seems fitting. Perhaps, in this case, it wastwo girls in Yorkshire that captured photographs of them, and making them seem to connect with all girls. (Almost all.) Ourdaughter was captivated by this program from start to finish. Not only was it our daughter, we too, being parents, were aslittle children - captured and enchanted with this tranquil film.The Cottingley Photographs, and the true account of what the girls (cousins) did during WWI, we are not too familiar with. Weare aware of the Cottingley Photographs and the girls, but that is all. So exactly how this film fits with what took place, wecannot say. One thing we can, this film is heart-stirring and warming, not only for the children but adults too.The two girls, the setting, the ""beck"" (stream), the houses, and all seems so realistic - not poorly done or overly done. Thenice thing here is, there are other things than only the faeries. Elsie's brother has already been laid to rest in a churchyard with headstone; her cousin's mother has passed away as well and her dad is missing in war action; they are still inblack mourning garments; were not suffered/permitted to go to the beck or speak of the faeries; also, Elsie's mother starts towonder about angels and faeries. Only a time or so is there bad language, but otherwise nothing to be alarmed by.This is one of those films that makes you want to repeat it and repeat it. Never tiring of it, and probably will not. Very welldone in every aspect. Watch Elsie awaken from her bed in slumber, and finding the rafters filled with faeries, or the beck(stream) scenes with the two girls - you may find yourself lost, as a child - in this compelling, relaxing, and tranquil film.We recommend it - whether young or not!",5,Faeries and girls. . .beautifully captured.,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,2010,"['ordered', 'enchanting', 'program', 'February', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'occasion', 'view', 'yet', 'never', 'tire', 'contrary', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'long', 'view', 'again.Faeries', 'girls', 'Faery', 'tales', 'stories', 'especially', 'girls', 'just', 'fitting', 'Perhaps', 'case', 'wastwo', 'girls', 'Yorkshire', 'captured', 'photographs', 'making', 'seem', 'connect', 'girls', 'Ourdaughter', 'was', 'captivated', 'program', 'start', 'finish', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'daughter', 'too', 'being', 'parents', 'were', 'aslittle', 'children', 'captured', 'enchanted', 'tranquil', 'film.The', 'Cottingley', 'Photographs', 'true', 'account', 'what', 'girls', 'cousins', 'did', 'WWI', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'familiar', 'Weare', 'aware', 'Cottingley', 'Photographs', 'girls', 'So', 'exactly', 'how', 'film', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'wecannot', 'say', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'film', 'heart-stirring', 'warming', 'not', 'only', 'children', 'adults', 'too.The', 'two', 'girls', 'setting', 'beck', 'stream', 'houses', 'so', 'realistic', 'not', 'poorly', 'done', 'overly', 'done', 'Thenice', 'thing', 'here', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'only', 'faeries', 'Elsie', 'brother', 'already', 'been', 'laid', 'rest', 'churchyard', 'headstone', 'cousin', 'mother', 'passed', 'away', 'as', 'well', 'dad', 'missing', 'war', 'action', 'are', 'still', 'inblack', 'mourning', 'garments', 'were', 'not', 'suffered/permitted', 'go', 'beck', 'speak', 'faeries', 'also', 'Elsie', 'mother', 'towonder', 'angels', 'faeries', 'Only', 'time', 'so', 'there', 'bad', 'language', 'otherwise', 'nothing', 'be', 'alarmed', 'by.This', 'one', 'films', 'want', 'repeat', 'repeat', 'Never', 'tiring', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'Very', 'welldone', 'aspect', 'Watch', 'Elsie', 'awaken', 'bed', 'slumber', 'finding', 'rafters', 'filled', 'faeries', 'beck', 'stream', 'two', 'girls', 'may', 'find', 'lost', 'child', 'compelling', 'relaxing', 'tranquil', 'film.We', 'recommend', 'young', 'not']",N/A
437164,A2EUW3NRLZ210Y,6304834039,Tony Wolf,"[0, 0]","This is what really happened; in 1917, and again in 1920, two rural English schoolgirl cousins went into the local woods and took photographs of paper cutouts shaped like fairies.  All historical evidence suggests that the girls intended nothing more than a simple, silly prank, which then spiraled out of their control. As one of them said, much later in life, ""I never even thought of it as being a fraud - it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun.  I can't understand to this day why they were taken in - they wanted to be taken in.""""They"" were the True Believers; Theosophists and Spiritualists, wonder seekers championed by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who took the Cottingley fairy photographs as clear proof of the existence of the supernatural.  To a nation reeling from the devastation of the First World War, the photographs offered a glimmer of hope ""beyond the veil""; if fairies were real, then perhaps death did not equal the extinction of identity.""Fairy Tale: A True Story"" is a brilliant, subtle and compassionate examination of the nature of faith during this very turbulent time.  Each major character has his or her own perspective on the fairies.  To Sir Arthur they represent the possibility of life beyond death and the vindication of his own father, who spent many years confined in a ""lunatic asylum"" and who frequently painted and wrote of seeing fairies.  To arch-skeptic Harry Houdini, who fought hard to expose the exploitation of the bereaved by fraudulent mediums, they represent a clever magic trick; an ultimately harmless and charming illusion.  Gardner, the Theosophist, comes up with increasingly far-fetched, pseudo-scientific theories about the fairies' true natures.  To the comically nasty and cynical reporter, Mr. Ferret - who is, other than Houdini, the only adult who figures out how the photographs were actually produced - the fairies are a juicy story, perhaps part of a conspiracy orchestrated by Sir Arthur.It is implied that the girls themselves come to realise the power of their own myth.  They are shown making a solemn ""vow of fairy secrecy"", which can either be interpreted as a promise not to reveal the magical secrets of real fairies, or as a promise not to reveal the simple trickery that has accidentally deceived the famous Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and so many others.  Also, at several points, when they are asked point-blank ""are the fairies real?"", by people for whom belief in fairies is clearly of great emotional importance, they exchange knowing looks before kindly nodding their heads.",5,"""Are fairies real?""",1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,2549,"['what', 'really', 'happened', '1917', 'again', '1920', 'two', 'rural', 'English', 'schoolgirl', 'cousins', 'went', 'local', 'woods', 'took', 'photographs', 'paper', 'cutouts', 'shaped', 'fairies', 'historical', 'evidence', 'girls', 'intended', 'nothing', 'more', 'simple', 'silly', 'prank', 'then', 'spiraled', 'control', 'one', 'said', 'much', 'later', 'life', 'never', 'even', 'thought', 'being', 'fraud', 'was', 'just', 'Elsie', 'having', 'bit', 'fun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'day', 'why', 'were', 'taken', 'wanted', 'be', 'taken', 'were', 'True', 'Believers', 'Theosophists', 'Spiritualists', 'wonder', 'seekers', 'championed', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'who', 'took', 'Cottingley', 'fairy', 'photographs', 'clear', 'proof', 'existence', 'supernatural', 'nation', 'reeling', 'devastation', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'photographs', 'offered', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'veil', 'fairies', 'were', 'real', 'then', 'perhaps', 'death', 'did', 'not', 'equal', 'extinction', 'identity', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'True', 'Story', 'brilliant', 'subtle', 'compassionate', 'examination', 'nature', 'faith', 'very', 'turbulent', 'time', 'major', 'character', 'own', 'perspective', 'fairies', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'represent', 'possibility', 'life', 'death', 'vindication', 'own', 'father', 'who', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'confined', 'lunatic', 'asylum', 'who', 'frequently', 'painted', 'wrote', 'seeing', 'fairies', 'arch-skeptic', 'Harry', 'Houdini', 'who', 'fought', 'hard', 'expose', 'exploitation', 'bereaved', 'fraudulent', 'mediums', 'represent', 'clever', 'magic', 'trick', 'ultimately', 'harmless', 'charming', 'illusion', 'Gardner', 'Theosophist', 'up', 'increasingly', 'far-fetched', 'pseudo-scientific', 'theories', 'fairies', 'true', 'natures', 'comically', 'nasty', 'cynical', 'reporter', 'Mr.', 'Ferret', 'who', 'other', 'Houdini', 'only', 'adult', 'who', 'out', 'how', 'photographs', 'were', 'actually', 'produced', 'fairies', 'are', 'juicy', 'story', 'perhaps', 'part', 'conspiracy', 'orchestrated', 'Sir', 'Arthur.It', 'implied', 'girls', 'come', 'realise', 'power', 'own', 'myth', 'are', 'shown', 'making', 'solemn', 'vow', 'fairy', 'secrecy', 'can', 'either', 'be', 'interpreted', 'promise', 'not', 'reveal', 'magical', 'secrets', 'real', 'fairies', 'promise', 'not', 'reveal', 'simple', 'trickery', 'accidentally', 'deceived', 'famous', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'Also', 'several', 'points', 'when', 'are', 'asked', 'point-blank', 'are', 'fairies', 'real', 'people', 'whom', 'belief', 'fairies', 'clearly', 'great', 'emotional', 'importance', 'exchange', 'knowing', 'looks', 'kindly', 'nodding', 'heads']",N/A
