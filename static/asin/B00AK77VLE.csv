1612693,A3OOHUTFTO6UZR,B00AK77VLE,BillBC,"[1, 1]","I bought this because I love Handel's operas.  I have 12 of them, including an earlier version of this one, in English, with Janet Baker.  All of them are great, except for a horrible Eurotrash version of Alcina, which I just can't watch.  I'm really fond of Natalie Dessay, and thought it would be good to have the Italian version (though actually the text of English version is really good...I wonder if it's a contemporary translation from Handel's period...does anyone know?This is a great performance.  Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find the stagehands moving around distracting at all.  In fact, it was nice to have some movement, something going on, since the opera is awfully static (like the rest of Handel's operas).  All the singers are great, with one exception, and that's why I gave it four instead of five stars.  Dessay is terrific, Ptolemy almost steals the show, Cornelia and Sextus are wonderful....The exception is the countertenor who sings Caesar.  His voice is fine, but his acting is beyond awful.  What on earth was he doing with his face?  I assume the real Julius Caesar was masculine, noble, the sort of thing you'd imagine a Roman conqueror to be.  This guy looks as though he playing a clown in a Christmas pantomine.  He grimaces and twitches and mugs. Time for some acting lessons....",4,Almost perfect.,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,1324,"['bought', 'love', 'Handel', 'operas', 'have', '12', 'including', 'earlier', 'version', 'one', 'English', 'Janet', 'Baker', 'are', 'great', 'horrible', 'Eurotrash', 'version', 'Alcina', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'m"", 'really', 'fond', 'Natalie', 'Dessay', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'have', 'Italian', 'version', 'actually', 'text', 'English', 'version', 'really', 'good', 'wonder', 'contemporary', 'translation', 'Handel', 'period', 'anyone', 'know', 'great', 'performance', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'stagehands', 'moving', 'around', 'distracting', 'fact', 'was', 'nice', 'have', 'movement', 'something', 'going', 'opera', 'awfully', 'static', 'rest', 'Handel', 'operas', 'singers', 'are', 'great', 'one', 'exception', 'why', 'gave', 'four', 'instead', 'five', 'stars', 'Dessay', 'terrific', 'Ptolemy', 'almost', 'show', 'Cornelia', 'Sextus', 'are', 'wonderful', '.The', 'exception', 'countertenor', 'who', 'Caesar', 'voice', 'fine', 'acting', 'awful', 'What', 'earth', 'was', 'doing', 'face', 'assume', 'real', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'was', 'masculine', 'noble', 'sort', 'thing', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'Roman', 'conqueror', 'be', 'guy', 'playing', 'clown', 'Christmas', 'pantomine', 'twitches', 'mugs', 'Time', 'acting', 'lessons']",Handel: Giulio Cesare

My only objection was the first scene, when Achilla brings in the head of Pompeo, it is just a very large head from a stone statue.  It did go well with the production, but I think they should have then added in the real severed head as every production I've seen does, because Cesare's response to the 'wicked man's cruelty' doesn't have as much force in reference to a statue-head, versus a real one.  Otherwise, I liked the production in general.The costumes were for the most part, nice, but Dessay's were distracting to me, as she had one breast falling in and out of her dress for almost the whole show.  For one long scene, at least they gave us a break from guessing about it, by simply showing her in a half-dress, or a completely ""off-the-breast"" dress, but then we had one of her little breasts staring at us for a long scene that was also distracting.  I don't really mind the nudity too much though, as they are in Egypt and it is hot there.  The thing that was really disturbing was the vulgar twerking.  I don't mind a few lewd suggestions, but Dessay came across to me as cheap and disgusting.The singing: it is the best of the commercial videos and I will play this one again as an audio recording.  Many are comparing this one to the Glyndebourne production, so I will follow suit.  Lawrence Zazzo is no Sarah Connolly, but he is cute, and has a pretty, reasonably full-bodied voice, with reasonable coloratura abilities.  The Cornelia and the Sesto are both an absolute delight in this video and exceed the pair in the Glyndebourne video.  Christophe Dumaux is similarly mediocre as he is at Glyndebourne.  Dessay sings wonderfully, is better than De Niese, however De Niese is a good singer, prettier, and a better comedic actress.  I will not comment on the Achilla, because I don't remember exactly how I felt about him.  The biggest blight of all in this video is the Nireno - where do they dig up these horrible countertenors?  It makes the whole countertenor fach come off as a big joke.  I'm sure he was supposed to be funny in his little dress and squawky voice, but it was just frightening and ugly.  And yes, he sang his aria in it's complete form - painful. The Nireno in the Glyndebourne production is kind of cute and not a horrible singer.And may I say, I just watched part of the Met Cesare with David Daniels and Dessay, and please do not wait on that one.  Any complainers about Zazzo, would probably begin to praise him after hearing Daniels and his tiny, breathy girl-voice struggling to sing five or more 16th notes without sliding them into an unmusical and bumpy portamento-like phrase - so ugly-sounding.  Handel deserves better.01-20-2014 update:  I played this recording audio-style only and noticed again the prettiness of Zazzo's voice, along with the entire cast sans the Nireno and the Achilla.  The Achilla in the Glyndbourne video is much better - this one has an ugly voice, plus he seems unsteady at the top.  Although I noticed this time that Dessay was a little tired-voiced, she is still my favorite Cleopatra ever and I love her singing in this video.  Also, I was surprised to find myself liking Zazzo every bit as much as I liked Conolly.  He might be a bit more interesting to listen to, although not quite as tasteful and tidy as Conolly.  Both made physically pleasant-looking Cesares.  I was possibly unfair to Dumaux, the Tolomeo in both videos.  His singing might be beyond 'mediocre'.  It's a pretty voice with reasonable coloratura abilities.  The voice is sometimes a bit hard to hear depending on the aria being sung, but sometimes he is quite impressively pretty-sounding in this video and he is never bad. And yes, the Nireno in this one was just as frighteningly ugly-sounding as I thought the first time through.  Thank goodness it's only one aria.",4,"Good singing, tasteless acting",1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,3911,"['liked', 'production', 'very', 'much', 'general', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'overly-busy', 'did', 'My', 'only', 'objection', 'was', 'first', 'scene', 'when', 'Achilla', 'head', 'Pompeo', 'just', 'very', 'large', 'head', 'stone', 'statue', 'did', 'go', 'well', 'production', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'then', 'added', 'real', 'severed', 'head', 'production', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Cesare', 'response', ""'wicked"", 'man', 'cruelty', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'force', 'reference', 'statue-head', 'real', 'one', 'Otherwise', 'liked', 'production', 'general.The', 'costumes', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'nice', 'Dessay', 'were', 'distracting', 'had', 'one', 'breast', 'falling', 'dress', 'almost', 'whole', 'show', 'one', 'long', 'scene', 'least', 'gave', 'break', 'guessing', 'simply', 'showing', 'half-dress', 'completely', 'off-the-breast', 'dress', 'then', 'had', 'one', 'little', 'breasts', 'staring', 'long', 'scene', 'was', 'also', 'distracting', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'nudity', 'too', 'much', 'though', 'are', 'Egypt', 'hot', 'there', 'thing', 'was', 'really', 'disturbing', 'was', 'vulgar', 'twerking', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'few', 'lewd', 'suggestions', 'Dessay', 'came', 'cheap', 'disgusting.The', 'singing', 'best', 'commercial', 'videos', 'will', 'play', 'one', 'again', 'audio', 'recording', 'Many', 'are', 'comparing', 'one', 'Glyndebourne', 'production', 'will', 'follow', 'suit', 'Lawrence', 'Zazzo', 'Sarah', 'Connolly', 'cute', 'pretty', 'reasonably', 'full-bodied', 'voice', 'reasonable', 'coloratura', 'abilities', 'Cornelia', 'Sesto', 'are', 'absolute', 'delight', 'video', 'exceed', 'pair', 'Glyndebourne', 'video', 'Christophe', 'Dumaux', 'similarly', 'mediocre', 'Glyndebourne', 'Dessay', 'sings', 'wonderfully', 'better', 'De', 'Niese', 'however', 'De', 'Niese', 'good', 'singer', 'prettier', 'better', 'comedic', 'actress', 'will', 'not', 'comment', 'Achilla', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exactly', 'how', 'felt', 'biggest', 'blight', 'video', 'Nireno', 'where', 'do', 'dig', 'horrible', 'countertenors', 'whole', 'countertenor', 'fach', 'come', 'off', 'big', 'joke', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'little', 'dress', 'squawky', 'voice', 'was', 'just', 'frightening', 'ugly', 'yes', 'sang', 'aria', 'complete', 'form', 'painful', 'Nireno', 'Glyndebourne', 'production', 'kind', 'cute', 'not', 'horrible', 'singer.And', 'may', 'say', 'just', 'watched', 'part', 'Met', 'Cesare', 'David', 'Daniels', 'Dessay', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'wait', 'one', 'complainers', 'Zazzo', 'would', 'probably', 'begin', 'praise', 'hearing', 'Daniels', 'tiny', 'breathy', 'girl-voice', 'struggling', 'sing', 'five', 'more', '16th', 'notes', 'sliding', 'unmusical', 'bumpy', 'portamento-like', 'phrase', 'so', 'ugly-sounding', 'Handel', 'better.01-20-2014', 'update', 'played', 'recording', 'audio-style', 'only', 'noticed', 'again', 'prettiness', 'Zazzo', 'voice', 'entire', 'cast', 'Nireno', 'Achilla', 'Achilla', 'Glyndbourne', 'video', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'ugly', 'voice', 'unsteady', 'top', 'noticed', 'time', 'Dessay', 'was', 'little', 'tired-voiced', 'still', 'favorite', 'Cleopatra', 'ever', 'love', 'singing', 'video', 'Also', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'liking', 'Zazzo', 'bit', 'as', 'much', 'liked', 'Conolly', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'listen', 'not', 'quite', 'tasteful', 'tidy', 'Conolly', 'Both', 'made', 'physically', 'pleasant-looking', 'Cesares', 'was', 'possibly', 'unfair', 'Dumaux', 'Tolomeo', 'videos', 'singing', 'might', 'be', ""'mediocre"", 'pretty', 'voice', 'reasonable', 'coloratura', 'abilities', 'voice', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'hard', 'hear', 'depending', 'aria', 'being', 'sung', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'impressively', 'pretty-sounding', 'video', 'never', 'bad', 'yes', 'Nireno', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'frighteningly', 'ugly-sounding', 'thought', 'first', 'time', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'only', 'one', 'aria']",Handel: Giulio Cesare

1612697,A3G1BXFMDPJT58,B00AK77VLE,"Steve Louck ""fritzwun""","[24, 34]","Guilio Cesare is a static, stand-and-deliver piece in the Baroque tradition of opera, with one aria following another and very little ensemble or choral music. To compensate, the creative team chose the storage basement/warehouse of a museum in which the singers come to life from statuary or paintings. So far so good. Superb singer-actor Natalie Dessay predictably delivers a superb performance. The remainder of the cast are a mixed bag, but all at least are acceptable. In contrast to the Beverly Sills recording from the 70's, this production uses three countertenors, a vocal type that not all will find pleasing.I would have given a 4 or 5 star rating for the music, despite the countertenors. But apparently to keep the viewer from becoming bored, this production includes museum staff constantly in motion as they work on the objects in storage, moving pieces here and there, sometimes interacting with the singers (who themselves are objects) and otherwise distracting from the music. After a while the annoyance level soars. The singers have plenty of acting and moving to do, and most do so well without diminishing the experience of the music.I purchased this DVD on the basis of a rave review in one of the music magazines, possibly BBC Music. I wish I hadn't. Between the constant stage business and the time occupied by countertenors, I found myself being less and less interested in this very long (3h40m) opera. Individual reactions, I would think, will vary a lot. I wish I had searched YouTube before I took the plunge.
