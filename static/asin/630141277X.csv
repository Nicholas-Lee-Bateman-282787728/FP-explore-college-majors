252031,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,630141277X,AbeStreet,"[3, 3]","This film has no action scenes, involves a romance, and tells the story of a working class female and her struggle to better her personal and professional life. On the surface the film may seem as though it is targeted towards a female audience, not so! Basically this film is about an underdog and the underdog's desire to better herself. This is something both males and females can relate to. The underdog, Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith), is not pure of heart. McGill manipulates, lies and deceives people to get what she wants. I think all people, to some extent, have done these very same things at some point in their lives. What is somewhat unique about this film is that the underdog has to come face to face with her moral wrong doings. Once she does this she is able to face the reality of her situation and for better or worse move on. Does she persevere and come out on top? I won't tell, watch the movie.I think Mike Nichols did a fine job of taking a somewhat common story (an underdogs struggle to advance/win), a cast of recognizable but (at the time of the release) non ""A"" list actors, and a nice but unspectacular song & score and produced a hit movie worthy of all the ""Oscar"" nominations it received, including a win for Best Song. In other words the sum of the parts was greater than a single part. Some movies boast big names or a great song but the film fails to have the emotional impact or appeal that WG does. Speaking only for myself, I heard ""Let the River Run"" by Carly Simon before I saw WG and I didn't think the song was all that great. After I saw the film the song took on an entirely new aspect and I loved it.Lastly, with the exception of Harrison Ford, who at that point in his career had not shed his action hero image, many of the actors in this film were not quite famous. Look for Kevin Spacy as a sleazy would be hiring boss, Oliver Platt who uses his supervisor position to act as a pimp, Joan Cusak reminds us why the 80's are known for ""big hair"", and a young Alec Baldwin who was busy trying to establish himself as an actor and not passing on his political ideology.As for the DVD, it's priced right considering there are no extra features.  I suspect, and hope a 20th anniversary edition is in the works.",4,"Don't label this film a ""chick flick"".",1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,2253,"['film', 'action', 'scenes', 'romance', 'story', 'working', 'class', 'female', 'struggle', 'better', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'surface', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'targeted', 'female', 'audience', 'not', 'so', 'Basically', 'film', 'underdog', 'underdog', 'desire', 'better', 'something', 'males', 'females', 'can', 'relate', 'underdog', 'Tess', 'McGill', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'not', 'pure', 'heart', 'McGill', 'lies', 'people', 'get', 'what', 'think', 'people', 'extent', 'have', 'done', 'very', 'same', 'things', 'point', 'lives', 'What', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'film', 'underdog', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'moral', 'wrong', 'doings', 'Once', 'able', 'face', 'reality', 'situation', 'better', 'worse', 'move', 'Does', 'persevere', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'watch', 'movie.I', 'think', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'taking', 'somewhat', 'common', 'story', 'underdogs', 'struggle', 'advance/win', 'cast', 'recognizable', 'time', 'release', 'A', 'list', 'actors', 'nice', 'unspectacular', 'song', 'score', 'produced', 'hit', 'movie', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'received', 'including', 'win', 'Best', 'Song', 'other', 'words', 'sum', 'parts', 'was', 'greater', 'single', 'part', 'movies', 'boast', 'big', 'names', 'great', 'song', 'film', 'have', 'emotional', 'impact', 'appeal', 'WG', 'Speaking', 'only', 'heard', 'Let', 'River', 'Run', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'saw', 'WG', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'song', 'was', 'great', 'saw', 'film', 'song', 'took', 'entirely', 'new', 'aspect', 'loved', 'it.Lastly', 'exception', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'who', 'point', 'career', 'had', 'not', 'shed', 'action', 'hero', 'image', 'many', 'actors', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'famous', 'Look', 'Kevin', 'Spacy', 'sleazy', 'would', 'be', 'hiring', 'boss', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'who', 'supervisor', 'position', 'act', 'pimp', 'Joan', 'Cusak', 'why', '80', 'are', 'known', 'big', 'hair', 'young', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'was', 'busy', 'trying', 'establish', 'actor', 'not', 'passing', 'political', 'ideology.As', 'DVD', 'priced', 'right', 'considering', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'suspect', 'hope', '20th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'works']",N/A
252032,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,630141277X,A Customer,"[6, 7]","1988's &quot;Working Girl&quot; had everything to appeal to all different kinds of people, and many things (Including I think the Star), to give a blow to a viewer's love of the movie. Melanie Griffith has done wonderfully in films like &quot;Milk Money&quot;, and even &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;...the infamous star-packed movie that ultimately didn't live up to it's potential. Griffith though was poorly chosen for this role, giving too-much air-headedness if you please, to a character who should've had more on the ball to get where she ended up in the movie. Obviously winning several awards for the role, more people thought differently, but I think that Griffith's lack of knowledge about everything makes the movie a little too fantasy-like. She plays secretary Tess McGill, who strives from the guidence from close friends, struggles from broken relationships and starts to make her way out from behind her desk when she meets and falls in love with successful banker Harrison Ford. The plot line is well thought up, and well played out by the powerhouse actors (Griffith, Ford, Alec Baldwin and Sigourney Weaver). Joan Cusack gives one of a string of her fabulous performances to come in the many years, earning Joan her first Oscar Nomination. A role that was unfairly lost to Geena Davis at the ceremony, leaving Joan still the most unappreciated true talent in the 8 years prior to the film. In my opinion, Melanie Griffith is rescued from dead-air by the charm and wit of Harrison Ford, and the pleasing and wonderful physical and emotional presence of Joan Cusack, playing Griffith's street-wise and comforting friend and collegue. I would've loved to see Joan with more air-time, Griffith with slightly less and maybe a more mature approach to her rise to the top that might have given this great movie even more potential. It's a great, sweet story of love and work though, well played out with a 95% great cast. It's definately worth a few looks, &quot;Working Girl&quot; deserves all the positive feedback it's gotten in 13 years...and Joan deserves her Oscar.

252040,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630141277X,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","`Working Girl' is smarter and funnier than I would have guessed it to be.  It has charm I didn't expect to find within it's interior, and while it's not a perfect piece it leaves little to be adamantly upset about for there really isn't much here to dislike or find fault with.  The acting is collectively great, even Harrison Ford delivering a layer of finesse I didn't think he possessed (I've never been a huge fan myself, but he sold me here).  Sure, parts of the film will have you scratch your head a bit, but not anymore than you would when watching pretty much any other film.The story centers around Tess McGill, a young secretary who dreams of making it in the working world.  Her means of making it though (hard work and determination) are met with adversity every step of the way.  She begins working for Katherine Parker who is more than willing to hear Tess out when she has any ideas, but when she finds out that Katherine has stolen her idea and plans to pitch it as her own she calculates a way to take her proposition back.  When Katherine is injured on vacation and her return is delayed Tess uses the opportunity to pose as her boss and pitch the idea herself.The film is a joyful and fun film, one that will make you enjoy your time in front of the television.  Across the board each actor delivers.  Like I mentioned, I'm not a huge Ford fan.  I find him a little dull, but he was charming here and believably witty, and I liked that.  Joan Cusack (I just LOVE her) is hilarious in her scene stealing role as Cyn, Tess' best friend.  Melanie Griffith handles her leading role graciously, maybe a little too graciously.  You can tell that she was so happy she received the part that she kind of stood aback, never really sinking her teeth into the part for fear of overdoing it and blowing the whole thing.  She does well, but she never truly gets lost in the role.  Not the same can be said for Sigourney Weaver who blew me away here.  Her performance was best in show, by a long shot, and deserved the Oscar for which she was nominated.  She really took control of her character and gave it everything she had.  You can tell that she enjoys the part she was given, and thus we enjoy her.I have to mention that there are a lot of big name actors here who have very limited screen time.  Oliver Platt is in one scene, as is Kevin Spacey and Olympia Dukakis, and Alec Baldwin and Philip Bosco are minimally used, and then you have actors like Ricki Lake and David Duchovny that are merely seen in passing glance.  Of these I must single out Kevin Spacey who was so ferociously mesmerizing in his single scene that I wish his part would have been expanded.  He was hilarious and eye-catching.  No wonder he blew up in such a huge way.`Working Girl' has a moral it purposes to teach the audience; that anyone can make it with a lot of heart and determination, and what other message is more becoming than that?  There are moments where it feels generic and a little overdone, but it's enjoyable no matter which way you slice or dice it, and it's a film you won't regret taking the time to soak in.  If anything, watch it or Weaver's scene stealing performance; a performance that deserves all the attention it can garner.",4,The film works; it really does...,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,3239,"['Working', 'Girl', 'smarter', 'funnier', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'be', 'charm', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', 'interior', 'not', 'perfect', 'piece', 'little', 'be', 'adamantly', 'upset', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'dislike', 'find', 'fault', 'acting', 'collectively', 'great', 'even', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'delivering', 'layer', 'finesse', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'possessed', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'sold', 'here', 'Sure', 'parts', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'scratch', 'head', 'bit', 'not', 'anymore', 'would', 'when', 'watching', 'pretty', 'much', 'other', 'film.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Tess', 'McGill', 'young', 'secretary', 'who', 'making', 'working', 'world', 'means', 'making', 'hard', 'work', 'determination', 'are', 'met', 'adversity', 'step', 'way', 'working', 'Katherine', 'Parker', 'who', 'more', 'willing', 'hear', 'Tess', 'out', 'when', 'ideas', 'when', 'out', 'Katherine', 'stolen', 'idea', 'plans', 'pitch', 'own', 'way', 'take', 'proposition', 'back', 'When', 'Katherine', 'injured', 'vacation', 'return', 'delayed', 'Tess', 'opportunity', 'pose', 'boss', 'pitch', 'idea', 'herself.The', 'film', 'joyful', 'fun', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'enjoy', 'time', 'front', 'television', 'board', 'actor', 'delivers', 'mentioned', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'Ford', 'fan', 'find', 'little', 'dull', 'was', 'charming', 'here', 'believably', 'witty', 'liked', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'just', 'LOVE', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'stealing', 'role', 'Cyn', 'Tess', 'best', 'friend', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'leading', 'role', 'graciously', 'maybe', 'little', 'too', 'graciously', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'received', 'part', 'kind', 'stood', 'aback', 'never', 'really', 'sinking', 'teeth', 'part', 'fear', 'overdoing', 'blowing', 'whole', 'thing', 'well', 'never', 'truly', 'lost', 'role', 'Not', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'who', 'blew', 'away', 'here', 'performance', 'was', 'best', 'show', 'long', 'shot', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'was', 'nominated', 'really', 'took', 'control', 'character', 'gave', 'everything', 'had', 'can', 'tell', 'part', 'was', 'given', 'thus', 'enjoy', 'her.I', 'have', 'mention', 'are', 'lot', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'here', 'who', 'have', 'very', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'one', 'scene', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'are', 'minimally', 'used', 'then', 'have', 'actors', 'Ricki', 'Lake', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'are', 'merely', 'seen', 'passing', 'glance', 'must', 'single', 'out', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'ferociously', 'mesmerizing', 'single', 'scene', 'wish', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'was', 'hilarious', 'eye-catching', 'wonder', 'blew', 'up', 'such', 'huge', 'way.', 'Working', 'Girl', 'moral', 'teach', 'audience', 'anyone', 'can', 'make', 'lot', 'heart', 'determination', 'what', 'other', 'message', 'more', 'becoming', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'generic', 'little', 'overdone', 'enjoyable', 'matter', 'way', 'slice', 'dice', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'taking', 'time', 'soak', 'anything', 'watch', 'Weaver', 'scene', 'stealing', 'performance', 'performance', 'attention', 'can', 'garner']",N/A

While there are no evil stepmoms and stepsisters here, Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith) finds herself in just as miserable a situation, with a conniving boss (portrayed by a perfectly lanky Sigourney Weaver) and a duplicitous boyfriend (portrayed with an adequate balance of arrogance and warmth by Alec Baldwin).Instead of a glass slipper, Tess slips into a little black dress with plenty of persuasion by her fairy godmother, Cynthia (played by John's big sister, Joan Cusack). The dress and the hair are key to hooking the corporate Prince (portrayed by a dapper Harrison Ford). It is the larger-than-life Cusack as ""Cyn"" -- Tess' nickname for her best friend from their Staten Island 'hood -- who rules in Working Girl.Best Supporting Actress Cusack steals more than one scene, such as the one in which she reacts to an expensive dress from the wardrobe of Tess' boss with the line: ""It's not even leather,"" the last word emphatically pronounced ""LEH-thuh"" as if the price tag on the dress were a working-class faux pas. In that scene, Griffith as Tess nearly faints.

Mike Nichols' ""Working Girl"", thankfully, is NOT in that category...it is as bright, witty, and endearing today as it was when 'big hair' was in fashion, and the World Trade Center was the pinnacle of the New York City skyline.The continuing appeal is due, in no small part, to the exceptional cast. Melanie Griffith, whose acting skills had been buried in minor 'nymphet' roles for a decade, seized the chance to finally display them, as a beautiful blue collar worker with the talent and drive to be much more. Signorney Weaver, equally good, has a field day as the manipulative, spoiled, 'silver spoon'-fed executive who arrogantly walks over everyone around her, making Griffith's decision to take advantage of an accident seem entirely justified. As the object of both women's desire, Harrison Ford, despite top billing, is really a supporting player to his two co-stars, but he fills the bill with a sweetness and charm that he seldom got to display in the Han Solo/Indiana Jones days. With the three leads in top form, and Mike Nichols at his most audience-friendly, the film had all the elements for an enduring classic.If you haven't seen ""Working Girl"" lately, check it out again, not only for the leads, but as an opportunity to enjoy Joan Cusack's ""Way-80s"" take as Griffith's best friend, a young, slim Alec Baldwin as the less-than-faithful boyfriend (TRIVIA: Tom Clancy's first two 'Jack Ryan' actors, Baldwin and Ford, appear in this film), and watch for small but memorable performances by Oliver Platt and Kevin Spacey (who NEVER seems to age!)

I recently purchased the DVD only to discover that there were several generally amusing scenes in the trailer that never made it into the movie - a bit of a mystery.The screenplay for this movie starts with a somewhat shaky premise that the means justify the end - that if you can't get an honest break but happen to work for an unethical boss who steals your ideas and gives you no credit, you can be as manipulative as you wish to get a chance to show how smart you are. This is hardly a palatable business lesson, ladies and gentlemen, and I have to fight down my qualms about this with every viewing.That said, and with that reservation, as a movie, it has a lot going for it: seamless direction by Mike Nichols; flawless ensemble acting from Melanie Griffiths, Sigourney Weaver, Harrison Ford (sigh!), Joan Cusack (with the most outrageous eye makeup in history)and people like Oliver Platt, Kevin Spacy and David Duchovny in tiny parts; great love scenes - humorous, tender and not too graphic; an optimistic ending; and one of the best songs ever written by Carly Simon.But, oh my, the beginning of this movie caught me totally off guard!

All these years I still remember the opening scene where Tess (Melanie Griffth), in her secretary outfit but wearing sports shoes, was on the ferry heading for the concrete jungle in Manhattan, accompanied by the unforgettable chorus of the theme song. It was early in the morning and Tess was just one of the many working at the low echelon for the big corporations.Having seen the movie again on DVD recently, I find the plot itself original and not a bit out of date. The clothes and hairstyles of the actresses are conspicuously different (afterall, it's the 80's). Apart from that, the movie itself enticed the audience with its dramatic breadth and emotional depth.As the story unfolded, Tess, a secretary who went to night schools and read magazines to upgrade herself, thought she striked gold when she explained her idea to her ""understanding""  boss Katharine (Sigourney Weaver), only to find later that Katharine stole her idea and pretended it was her own. Out of sheer determination and intelligence, Tess reversed her fortune by imposturing as a senior executive, teamed up with Jack (Harrison Ford) and was so close to completing an ingenious business deal - until Katharine came back from her leg injury and took control of the boardroom...Despite the apparent Cinderella happy ending, the fluid story-telling lured the audience to find out what Tess exactly did to triumph in the end. By asking a critical question in the right place at the right moment, Tess turned her fortune again. The last 10 minutes of the movie was intriguing. Success, when it did come eventually, was far beyond Tess's expectations. And it was not only Tess, but secretaries just like her, who cheered for her.The success of the movie owed much to the superb cast - the refreshed and good looking Melannie Griffth, cunning and calculating boss Signourney Weaver, the charming Harrsion Ford and the ever supportive best friend Joan Cusack; the well-written script which radiated warmth and conveyed an upbeat message - merits and efforts count and will prevail over evil; not to forget the easy to hum tune.  Without any of these, the movie would have been a one too many formulaic Cinderella story.The most entertaining movie of its genre - Working Girl the movie is worth watching again.(Incidentally, the movie's success spawned a short-lived TV series Working Girl in 1990, starring Sandra Bullock.)",5,an upbeat movie with an unforgettable theme song,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,2443,"['been', '15', 'years', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'years', 'still', 'remember', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Tess', 'Melanie', 'Griffth', 'secretary', 'outfit', 'wearing', 'sports', 'shoes', 'was', 'ferry', 'heading', 'concrete', 'jungle', 'Manhattan', 'accompanied', 'unforgettable', 'chorus', 'theme', 'song', 'was', 'early', 'morning', 'Tess', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'working', 'low', 'echelon', 'big', 'corporations.Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'again', 'DVD', 'recently', 'find', 'plot', 'original', 'not', 'bit', 'date', 'clothes', 'hairstyles', 'actresses', 'are', 'conspicuously', 'different', 'afterall', '80', 'Apart', 'movie', 'enticed', 'audience', 'dramatic', 'breadth', 'emotional', 'depth.As', 'story', 'unfolded', 'Tess', 'secretary', 'who', 'went', 'night', 'schools', 'read', 'magazines', 'upgrade', 'thought', 'striked', 'gold', 'when', 'explained', 'idea', 'understanding', 'boss', 'Katharine', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'only', 'find', 'later', 'Katharine', 'stole', 'idea', 'pretended', 'was', 'own', 'sheer', 'determination', 'intelligence', 'Tess', 'reversed', 'fortune', 'imposturing', 'senior', 'executive', 'teamed', 'up', 'Jack', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'was', 'so', 'close', 'completing', 'ingenious', 'business', 'deal', 'Katharine', 'came', 'back', 'leg', 'injury', 'took', 'control', 'boardroom', 'apparent', 'Cinderella', 'happy', 'ending', 'fluid', 'story-telling', 'lured', 'audience', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Tess', 'exactly', 'did', 'triumph', 'end', 'asking', 'critical', 'question', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'moment', 'Tess', 'turned', 'fortune', 'again', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'intriguing', 'Success', 'when', 'did', 'come', 'eventually', 'was', 'far', 'Tess', 'expectations', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'Tess', 'just', 'who', 'cheered', 'her.The', 'success', 'movie', 'owed', 'much', 'superb', 'cast', 'refreshed', 'good', 'looking', 'Melannie', 'Griffth', 'cunning', 'calculating', 'boss', 'Signourney', 'Weaver', 'charming', 'Harrsion', 'Ford', 'ever', 'supportive', 'best', 'friend', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'well-written', 'script', 'radiated', 'warmth', 'conveyed', 'upbeat', 'message', 'merits', 'efforts', 'count', 'will', 'prevail', 'evil', 'not', 'forget', 'easy', 'hum', 'tune', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'formulaic', 'Cinderella', 'story.The', 'most', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'genre', 'Working', 'Girl', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'Incidentally', 'movie', 'success', 'spawned', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'Working', 'Girl', '1990', 'starring', 'Sandra', 'Bullock']",N/A

252066,A2GYX971VETQBV,630141277X,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[4, 16]","From the opening of the film, where we are treated to an outrageous glimpse of female hair in the 1980s, I knew I was in for a different kind of movie.  WORKING GIRL chronicles Tess McGill's (played by Melanie Griffith) struggle against a working world dominated by men and education.  While working as a secretary for a serpentine boss (Sigourney Weaver), Tess takes advantage of her boss's skiing accident to try her hand at running the show.  Naturally, things spiral towards a climax and the film ends in an all-too-typical fashion.To be honest, I really do not know what to say about this film.  It was billed as a Mike Nichols comedy, so I thought I was going to get a love-story/romantic comedy of the working world.  I was wrong.  WORKING GIRL suffers from the fact that it does not seem to know what genre it is producing.  To be sure, it has a few jokes, but the meat of the film is an awkward drama told at a slow pace.  In fact, it is only a ""comedy"" insofar as its storyline focuses on an ordinary character whose development goes from a depressing low to an ecstatic high.  I really expected more from Nichols.  Any glance at his career will confirm that he is capable of far more.  I also expected more from this cast.  Everybody is in this film and most of them can act, so I must conclude that it was the script.On top of everything else, I found it hard to identify with Tess's character.  On the one hand, you wanted to see her succeed over her scheming boss.  But Tess resorts to equally (if not more fraudulent) tactics in order to weasel her way to the top.  She does not ""sleep"" her way up the chain of command as other films have depicted, but she might as well have because her methods are just as questionable.  I find it quite hard to believe that things would work out for her as well as they do.  You just do not hire someone who falsely presents herself as a professional, no matter how smart or dedicated she may be.Why did WORKING GIRL get nominated for so many Oscars?  It beats me.  I can only guess that it garnered votes for tackling a tough topic (the male domination of the working world), having an all-star cast, and for having Mike Nichols as its director.  For these reasons, I shall give it two stars.  But my recommendation is that you skip this film and watch any other film that Mike Nichols has made.",2,Awkward Drama from an Outstanding Director,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,2347,"['opening', 'film', 'where', 'are', 'treated', 'outrageous', 'glimpse', 'female', 'hair', '1980s', 'knew', 'was', 'different', 'kind', 'movie', 'WORKING', 'GIRL', 'Tess', 'McGill', 'played', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'struggle', 'working', 'world', 'dominated', 'men', 'education', 'working', 'secretary', 'serpentine', 'boss', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Tess', 'advantage', 'boss', 'skiing', 'accident', 'try', 'hand', 'running', 'show', 'Naturally', 'things', 'spiral', 'towards', 'climax', 'film', 'all-too-typical', 'fashion.To', 'be', 'honest', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'billed', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'comedy', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'love-story/romantic', 'comedy', 'working', 'world', 'was', 'wrong', 'WORKING', 'GIRL', 'suffers', 'fact', 'not', 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'genre', 'producing', 'be', 'sure', 'few', 'jokes', 'meat', 'film', 'awkward', 'drama', 'told', 'slow', 'pace', 'fact', 'only', 'comedy', 'insofar', 'storyline', 'ordinary', 'character', 'development', 'depressing', 'low', 'ecstatic', 'high', 'really', 'expected', 'more', 'Nichols', 'glance', 'career', 'will', 'confirm', 'capable', 'far', 'more', 'also', 'expected', 'more', 'cast', 'Everybody', 'film', 'most', 'can', 'act', 'must', 'conclude', 'was', 'script.On', 'top', 'everything', 'else', 'found', 'hard', 'identify', 'Tess', 'character', 'one', 'hand', 'wanted', 'see', 'succeed', 'scheming', 'boss', 'Tess', 'equally', 'not', 'more', 'fraudulent', 'tactics', 'order', 'weasel', 'way', 'top', 'not', 'sleep', 'way', 'chain', 'command', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'depicted', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'methods', 'are', 'just', 'questionable', 'find', 'quite', 'hard', 'believe', 'things', 'would', 'work', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'hire', 'someone', 'who', 'falsely', 'professional', 'matter', 'how', 'smart', 'dedicated', 'may', 'be.Why', 'did', 'WORKING', 'GIRL', 'get', 'nominated', 'so', 'many', 'Oscars', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'garnered', 'votes', 'tackling', 'tough', 'topic', 'male', 'domination', 'working', 'world', 'having', 'all-star', 'cast', 'having', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'director', 'reasons', 'shall', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'recommendation', 'skip', 'film', 'watch', 'other', 'film', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'made']",N/A
252067,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,630141277X,David Anderson,"[4, 4]","""Working Girl"", starring Harrison Ford, Melanie Griffith, Sigourney Weaver, and others, is truly a top ten film of 1988.  It received six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, winning one.  This charming plot follows Tess (Griffith), a secretary with an ambition to reach the top, struggling to be heard.  Through an unpleasant boss (Weaver) and other idea stealers, she must let nothing stop her.  Meanwhile, her struggle only grows stronger as time passes.  Slowly, she begins realizing her true self and her romantic feelings for the most unlikely man (Ford).Through these events, the humor and the dramatic action maintain their potential strength.  Each element features itself well in the perfect scenes, offering great viewing variety.  Director Mike Nichols leads the cast and crew to give this wonderful storyline the great recognition it deserves.  The most unlikely overall theme fits one another greatly.  Most other films that attempt similar ideas don't succeed, which started becoming increasingly common in the 1980's.  Few other films make such minor issues blend so well like ""Working Girl"".Portions of this film feature great music mostly written by legendary artist Carly Simon (""You're So Vain"", 1971) that gives this a great extention.  This film opens and closes with the perfect song, the Oscar winning (Best Original Song) ""Let the River Run"".  Like this one, all tracks from her were written and performed beautifully.  All prove her level of musical greatness and influence.Beyond the brilliant storyline of ""Working Girl"" notes the charming and enjoyable performances from the cast, especially Griffith, Ford, Weaver, Alec Baldwin and Joan Cusack.  This film displays Griffith at her career best in her Oscar-nominated performance (Best Actress).  She features all sides of her character very well, maintaining the nice, yet ambitious personality.  Weaver proves that she's more than the science fiction prodigy Lt. Ripley (""Alien"" trilogy).  Her Golden Globe winning and Oscar-nominated performance (Best Supporting Actress) proves that 1988 was her big year in cinema.  The character's witty and unpleasant personality expresses itself wonderfully.  Viewers should watch for minor roles from Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, David Duchovny and Ricki Lake before they became household names.""Working Girl"" makes a great viewing classic for those wanting great laughs.

But the sexist, class-conscious business world just won't take her seriously.  Finally she hooks up with Katherine Parker (Sigourney Weaver), a successful but vulturous deal-maker with an elevated opinion of herself who knows how to use people.  They set up a mentor relationship with Tess getting the coffee and Katherine spouting the words of wisdom.  When Tess comes up with a good business idea, Katherine steals it.Enter soon after Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) and we have our triangle.  Katherine has broken her leg skiing and Tess has to fill in for her.  When Tess discovers that Katherine has ripped off her idea, she decides to assume Katherine's accouterments, including her lavish apartment, her wardrobe, her hairstyle, and as it turns out, her boyfriend.  Will she succeed, and will she find true love and happiness with the leading man?  Inquiring minds want to know.Director Mike Nichols, auteur of a number of film land successes of more than average sophistication, including Postcards from the Edge (1990), The Graduate (1967), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966), etc. with help from screen writer Kevin Wade and Melanie herself, manages to create enough sympathy for Tess that we want her to win.  Sigourney Weaver does such a fine job of being a kind of sociopathic villainess that we want her to lose.  Guess what happens?While this is not on the same level as the three Mike Nichols flicks mentioned above, either in terms of cinematic significance or craftsmanship, it is clever and witty at times, and the story is one that most American women will find easy to identify with.  And of course the winner gets Harrison Ford, displaying his usual bodice-busting charm.  Only problem (aside from some smarmy pandering to a chick flick audience) is that the chemistry between Melanie Griffith and Harrison Ford is lacking.See this for Mike Nichols whose direction here can be described as just a working guy trying to make a buck and not doing a bad job of it.",3,Who's afraid of Sigourney Weaver?,1051488000,"04 28, 2003",2003,2226,"['Working', 'girl', 'Tess', 'McGill', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'sporting', 'serious', 'hair', 'continuously', 'being', 'mistaken', 'coffee', 'tea', 'kind', 'person', 'when', 'fact', 'hard', 'widely', 'studies', 'nights', 'get', 'ahead', 'business', 'world', 'sexist', 'class-conscious', 'business', 'world', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'Finally', 'up', 'Katherine', 'Parker', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'successful', 'vulturous', 'deal-maker', 'elevated', 'opinion', 'herself', 'who', 'how', 'use', 'people', 'set', 'up', 'mentor', 'relationship', 'Tess', 'getting', 'coffee', 'Katherine', 'spouting', 'words', 'wisdom', 'When', 'Tess', 'up', 'good', 'business', 'idea', 'Katherine', 'steals', 'it.Enter', 'soon', 'Jack', 'Trainer', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'have', 'triangle', 'Katherine', 'broken', 'leg', 'skiing', 'Tess', 'fill', 'When', 'Tess', 'Katherine', 'ripped', 'off', 'idea', 'assume', 'Katherine', 'accouterments', 'including', 'lavish', 'apartment', 'wardrobe', 'hairstyle', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'Will', 'succeed', 'will', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'happiness', 'leading', 'man', 'Inquiring', 'minds', 'want', 'know.Director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'auteur', 'number', 'film', 'land', 'successes', 'more', 'average', 'sophistication', 'including', 'Postcards', 'Edge', '1990', 'Graduate', '1967', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', '1966', 'etc', 'help', 'screen', 'writer', 'Kevin', 'Wade', 'Melanie', 'create', 'enough', 'sympathy', 'Tess', 'want', 'win', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'fine', 'job', 'being', 'kind', 'sociopathic', 'villainess', 'want', 'lose', 'Guess', 'what', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'three', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'flicks', 'mentioned', 'terms', 'cinematic', 'significance', 'craftsmanship', 'clever', 'witty', 'times', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'American', 'women', 'will', 'find', 'easy', 'identify', 'course', 'winner', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'displaying', 'usual', 'bodice-busting', 'charm', 'Only', 'problem', 'aside', 'smarmy', 'pandering', 'chick', 'flick', 'audience', 'chemistry', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'lacking.See', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'direction', 'here', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'just', 'working', 'guy', 'trying', 'make', 'buck', 'not', 'doing', 'bad', 'job']",N/A

It is well directed and features a funny script and excellent performances by Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver. Melanie Griffith is quite good as well, although she sometimes appears a little more childish than would be expected given her ambition to rise to the top.Essentially, Working Girl is about Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith), an ambitious secretary eager to move up in the working world. After having several problems with her male bosses, Tess is relieved when she is transfered to work under the confident and seemingly friendly Katherine Parker (Sigourney Weaver). After Parker breaks her leg and Tess realizes she was planning to steal one of her ideas, however, Tess takes matters into her own hands and, posing as Parker, joins with successful executive Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) to promote the deal herself.Anyhow, the results of Tess McGill's attempts to advance in her job are very entertaining and often very funny. The scenes with Tess and Jack are especially humorous - for instance, as they walk towards the elevator in one scene, Jack repeatedly asks Tess for a date, but she refuses. When he insists, she responds, ""You know, maybe I just don't like you."" Jack looks up in surprise and, as the elevator doors close, says, ""Me? Nah!""So, overall, this is a very delightful and fun movie that shows the obstacles people sometimes face in the workplace. In it, Harrison Ford shows his ability for light comedy, Weaver is perfect as the calculating and evil boss, and Griffith is pretty good as Tess. On another more serious note, this movie has some of the most beautiful images of the World Trade Towers and the New York City skyline I have ever seen.

And this movie cerainly is such a misfire. I once read Roger Ebert's review of BILLY JACK. He said something to the effect that its makers seem to have lost faith in democracy and call upon us instead to pull for the good fascists defeating the bad fascists. It's been years since I've seen BILLY JACK, and, although never highly motivated to see it again, I'd need to to assess the accuracy of that characterization. But just replace the word ""fascists"" with the phrase ""corporate wheeler-dealers"" in the above, and you've pretty well got the theme of WORKING GIRL (I suppose some ardent anti-capitalists might say corporate wheeler-dealers are a form of fascists, but I won't go that far). This movie won an Oscar for best song with a song proclaiming ""The New Jerusalem"". Funny how the same year Christian groups raised a fury of protest over THE LAST TEMPTATIOPN OF CHRIST, so much so that that movie is only just now becoming routinely available in video stores (at least where I live). At least THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST was honest and forthright in expressing its alternative view of the Christian story; that's freedom of expression as it was best meant to work. A much worse and insidious form if insensitivity to a religion consists in casually invoking its concepts in such a way as to trivialize them. That is just what WORKING GIRL does through its unfortunately Oscar-winning song. In the Bible, the New Jerusalem represents the most final and complete victory of God over all evil -- a new state of existence in which ""every tear shall be wiped away"". It could scarcely be more removed from something so mundane as the good corporate wheeler-dealers defeating the bad corporate wheeler-dealers. Melanie Griffith was nominated for best actress for this movie. When Ebert and his late lamented partner Gene Siskel did their ""If we picked the winners"" for that year, they speculated on her chances and those of her four competing nominees. A particularly incomprehensible idea put forth was that a nominee who played someone ""not nice"" would be less popular and hence her chances of winning diminished. Of all things, they singled out Meryl Streep in A CRY IN THE DARK, as the one allegedly playing ""not nice"". While Streep's character may not have been exactly miss congeniality, I find her singling out uncomprehensible. Glenn Close (robbed of best actress the previous year for a much more stunning performance) played an outright villain in her nominated performance that year. Whatever the real Dian Fossey may have been like, Sigourney Weaver's depiction of her was as scary and demented a character as one could ever imagine being nonetheless heroic. And Jodie Foster (who was to be the winner) played as arrogant a jerk as we'd ever want to imagine thrust into a protagonist role. Were it a niceness contest, I'd far and away take Meryl Streep's character over any of those and over Melanie Griffith's portrayal of an impossibly absurd combination of Machiavelli and Goody Two-shoes in WORKING GIRL.",1,Smirking Girl,1011830400,"01 24, 2002",2002,3225,"['When', 'movie', 'combine', 'elements', 'essentially', 'farcical', 'comedy', 'more', 'high-concept', 'consciousness-raising', 'stuff', 'not', 'sure', 'formula', 'misfire', 'certainly', 'one', 'movie', 'cerainly', 'such', 'misfire', 'once', 'read', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'BILLY', 'JACK', 'said', 'something', 'effect', 'makers', 'seem', 'have', 'lost', 'faith', 'democracy', 'call', 'instead', 'pull', 'good', 'fascists', 'defeating', 'bad', 'fascists', 'been', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'BILLY', 'JACK', 'never', 'highly', 'motivated', 'see', 'again', ""'d"", 'need', 'assess', 'accuracy', 'characterization', 'just', 'replace', 'word', 'fascists', 'phrase', 'corporate', 'wheeler-dealers', 'above', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'well', 'got', 'theme', 'WORKING', 'GIRL', 'suppose', 'ardent', 'anti-capitalists', 'might', 'say', 'corporate', 'wheeler-dealers', 'are', 'form', 'fascists', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'movie', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'song', 'song', 'proclaiming', 'New', 'Jerusalem', 'Funny', 'how', 'same', 'year', 'Christian', 'groups', 'raised', 'fury', 'protest', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATIOPN', 'OF', 'CHRIST', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'only', 'just', 'now', 'becoming', 'routinely', 'available', 'video', 'stores', 'least', 'where', 'live', 'least', 'LAST', 'TEMPTATION', 'OF', 'CHRIST', 'was', 'honest', 'forthright', 'expressing', 'alternative', 'view', 'Christian', 'story', 'freedom', 'expression', 'was', 'best', 'meant', 'work', 'much', 'worse', 'insidious', 'form', 'insensitivity', 'religion', 'casually', 'invoking', 'concepts', 'such', 'way', 'trivialize', 'just', 'what', 'WORKING', 'GIRL', 'unfortunately', 'Oscar-winning', 'song', 'Bible', 'New', 'Jerusalem', 'most', 'final', 'complete', 'victory', 'God', 'evil', 'new', 'state', 'existence', 'tear', 'shall', 'be', 'wiped', 'away', 'could', 'scarcely', 'be', 'more', 'removed', 'something', 'so', 'mundane', 'good', 'corporate', 'wheeler-dealers', 'defeating', 'bad', 'corporate', 'wheeler-dealers', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'actress', 'movie', 'When', 'Ebert', 'late', 'lamented', 'partner', 'Gene', 'Siskel', 'did', 'picked', 'winners', 'year', 'speculated', 'chances', 'four', 'competing', 'nominees', 'particularly', 'incomprehensible', 'idea', 'put', 'forth', 'was', 'nominee', 'who', 'played', 'someone', 'not', 'nice', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'popular', 'hence', 'chances', 'winning', 'diminished', 'things', 'singled', 'out', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'A', 'CRY', 'IN', 'THE', 'DARK', 'one', 'allegedly', 'playing', 'not', 'nice', 'Streep', 'character', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'exactly', 'miss', 'congeniality', 'find', 'singling', 'out', 'uncomprehensible', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'robbed', 'best', 'actress', 'previous', 'year', 'much', 'more', 'stunning', 'performance', 'played', 'outright', 'villain', 'nominated', 'performance', 'year', 'real', 'Dian', 'Fossey', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'depiction', 'was', 'scary', 'demented', 'character', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'being', 'nonetheless', 'heroic', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'was', 'be', 'winner', 'played', 'arrogant', 'jerk', ""'d"", 'ever', 'want', 'imagine', 'thrust', 'protagonist', 'role', 'Were', 'niceness', 'contest', ""'d"", 'far', 'away', 'take', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'character', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'portrayal', 'impossibly', 'absurd', 'combination', 'Machiavelli', 'Goody', 'Two-shoes', 'WORKING', 'GIRL']",N/A

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Not that I've ever been chased around the desk by my horny boss or anything, but you have to be a right bastard to not sympathize with Tess McGill's plight. 30-year-old Tess is intelligent and is always thinking up big, bold ideas, but she languishes in the vast secretarial pool of a brokerage firm. Not blessed with the right upbringing, she takes night courses to better herself. But her buxom blonde looks tend to get her the chauvinistic treatment from her superiors.And this even applies to her high-powered new boss, Katherine Parker. Katherine - played with forked-tongued smugness by Sigourney Weaver - smarms up to Tess that their working relationship is a two-way street, but Katherine has no compunctions about hijacking Tess's brilliant business idea and claiming credit. When Katherine breaks her leg on a skiing trip and has to spend time away from work, and when Tess learns of Katherine's duplicity, the awesome revenge is on.WORKING GIRL is hands down Melanie Griffith's best movie, and it takes full advantage of her past roles as a sexy femme fatale - most notably in SOMETHING WILD and BODY DOUBLE - to frame Tess in juxtaposition. As Tess herself admits: ""I have a head for business and a bod for sin."" Made in the '80s, in the heyday of unapologetic big hair and huge shoulder padded jackets, the film may look dated, but the story is one of those timeless ones. Coming after 9 TO 5, WORKING GIRL is also a gender reversing of THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS, although Michael J. Fox was never perceived as anywhere near to being a sex symbol. Melanie Griffith is again objectified, but her aching vulnerability here and sense of humor and gumption in the face of obstinacy and blatant prejudice make her someone you mightily root for.Her transformation from tackily bejeweled secretary to posh executive feels organic, partly because the film takes time to demonstrate Tess's potential but mostly because Griffith instills an awkwardness and nervousness in her character, and this tension shines whenever she's putting on the deception. Tess knows that she's reaching for the moon, and she's frightened but appealingly determined. She knows she deserves better - her skills qualify her for a better lot in life - than a sleazoid boyfriend and a dead-end career. Well, damn, it's the American dream. Tess is forced to get by on advice such as: ""You wanna be taken seriously, you need serious hair.""It doesn't hurt that Sigourney Weaver is so terrific as the sophisticated two-faced heel. Griffith and Weaver (and, come to think of it, Joan Cusack) are so good they were nominated, justifiably so, for, respectively, the 1988's Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress awards (none of them won, although Carly Simon's  towering anthem ""Let the River Run"" did win for Best Song). Director Mike Nichols makes sure that, acting-wise, Griffith isn't stranded on an island. She gets very good support from Alec Baldwin and the always wonderful Joan Cusack. Harrison Ford, thoughtfully charming and slightly world-weary, plays Jack Trainer, the investment broker she partners with in her wild scheme, although I must say Ford gets involved in one of the more far-fetched plot twists in the movie. Kevin Spacey cameos as a corporate Romeo.WORKING GIRL is joyful and hopeful, and it's got one of the most feel good endings I've ever seen on film. It's not often nowadays that Melanie Griffith comes to mind, but whenever she does, this is the movie I picture her in.

When she comes home from work to find him in bed with a friend, she wipes the tears away, and sets out to make her mark in the business world.Tess obtains an assistant job working for hotshot business woman Katherine played to the hilt by Sigourney Weaver.  This turns out to be just as demeaning as working for lascivious male  bosses, but in a whole new way.  Tess plays the game, placating Katherine, but attempting to bring ideas to the fray in hopes of impressing her boss, and landing a promotion.  Instead, Katherine attempts to steal Tess's ideas.Realizing she's being played, Tess gets even when Katherine leaves town.  She gets a  businesswoman makeover from best friend Joan Cusack, new hair, and Katherine's dress.  She has access to Katherines fancy apartment, and uses her equipment to impress Jack Traynor (Harrison Ford)a business executive.The flirtatious interplay between Tess and Jack is a delight to watch unfold.  Jack falls for the savvy businesswoman with a ""Head for business, and a bod for sin.""  Problems arise when Katherine returns, since SHE has been cultivating Jack as husband material, unbekownst to Tess.The games, one upmanship, and competiton between Tess and Katherine mount higher, with Katherine doing her very best to leave Tess drowning in the secretary pool.  Tess must pull out all the stops to outwit her boss, convince the company bigwigs that SHE has the winning ideas, and, most of all, win Jack away from Katherine.Mike Nichols, famous for his direction of 1967s classic  ""The Graduate"", turns out a highly entertaining, delightful film.  The three leads are wonderful, and the supporting cast lends the finishing touch.  Who doesn't love a true ""feel good"" comedy that you watch with a smile on your face?  ""Working Girl"" is, and does that.  It's one of those modern day movies that has an old fashioned charm.  It is at once adventurous, romantic and humorous in a wholesome way not seen too often anymore.  It's a true ""Cinderella"" story brought up to date in a bustling Manhattan.There is one irony herein.  The closing of the movie, and the titles role while fixed on a shot of the World Trade Centers in all their glory.Originally,  I assume we were supposed to look upon them as symbols of victory for the winning characters in the film.  Unfortunately, now that the horror of 9/11 has taken away these icons of success and prosperity, the mood of happiness is dampened at the close in the knowledge that they're gone.  However, I wouldn't have it any other way.

Whenever it is on the tube, like it was tonight, I will make a point of watching the end of the film just to see the part where Melanie Griffith's Tess McGill realizes that she has just made her dream comes true and turns her head slowly to look at her office (see: Tear Jerker Scenes, below).  Plus Carly Simon's &quot;Let the Rivers Run&quot; is one of her best songs and a great song to open and close this film.  But one of the things I remember about this 1988 film is that Griffith received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress instead of Susan Sarandon for &quot;Bull Durham.&quot;  Griffith is good, but Sarandon was better.  For that matter, &quot;Working Girl&quot; is good, but &quot;Bull Durham&quot; is better, which means it should have been on AFI's list.  Granted most people would probably take Harrison Ford over Kevin Costner (although it was a closer call back in 1988), but Sigourney Weaver versus Tim Robbins is a real hard call for the third part of the love triangle.This rags to riches story focuses on secretary McGill, who has her eyes set on moving on up in the world of big business.  When she is hired by Katherine Parker (Weaver), Associate Partner for Mergers &amp; Acquisitions at Petty Marsh (good name) she thinks the glass ceiling has opened up.  But it turns out her friendly female boss has been stealing her ideas.  When Katharine is away, Tess gives herself a make over and starts playing with the big boys, in particular Jack Trainer (Ford), a Partner with Dewey Stone.  Of course they end up mixing love and business, but it turns out to be a small world because it seems Jack and Katharine have been dating.  The fantastic Joan Cusak plays Cyn, Tess's best bud, while Alec Baldwin is Mick Dugan, who is definitely not the man of Tess's dreams.  Keep your eyes open for Kevin Spacey as the lecherous Bob Speck, Olympia Dukakis as the Personnel Director, and David Duchovny as Cyn's Engagement Party Guest.Tear Jerker Scenes: (1) &quot;No, Miss McGill.  That's your office.  in there.&quot;Most Romantic Line: Actually the most romantic part is when Jack packs Tess's lunch for her first day of work, but the big lines are: (1) &quot;I have a head for business and a bod for sin. Is there anything wrong with that?&quot; and (2) &quot;You can bend the rules plenty once you get to the top, but not while you're trying to get there. And if you're someone like me, you can't get there without bending the rules.&quot;  Well, the title is &quot;WORKING Girl,&quot; people.If you like &quot;Working,&quot; then check out these other films on AFI's list: #74 &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; and #12 &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot;  Why?  Because &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; is also about the travails of love in the work place and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; is about transformation.

Ahem. Now being a few years past 30 myself, I'm thinking, ""wow, Sigourney Weaver had gotten so far so young!"" Shows you what 15 years'll do for ya.Just saw it for only the second time the other night at the New-York Historical Society, tie in to their ""Women in Business"" exhibit with a gaggle of girlfriends. I was a little antsy, because I was afraid maybe it wasn't going to be as good as I recalled. But thanks be, it was! And the girlfriends all loved it, too, except that Lorraine wondered why it was her coworker's favorite movie. I can't answer that, but it's a great ride notwithstanding.Melanie Griffith turns in her best performance as our Working Girl, an extremely competent would-be businesswoman. Trouble is, with her big hair, jingle jangle bangles, and questionable wardrobe, she's having a hard time being taken seriously. Finally, she gets assigned as secretary to a female boss, Sigourney Weaver, who epitomizes class and breezy elegance. Melanie thinks she's found her mentor at long last, only to discover, while running errands for the hospitalized Weaver, that the lady boss has stolen her Big Idea. Then she finds her boyfriend in bed with another woman. All this pushes her over into making a wild reach for the brass ring by stealing the clothes and business contacts of the absent Weaver and hacking off that head of hair to steal back her own idea and make it work. Along the way, she attracts the attentions of banker Harrison Ford and together they scramble to pull off the deal, Ford not in on her true identity as a mere secretary.The only thing that's a bit much in the movie is too much gratuitous Merry Widow lingerie, but small complaint for a really fun, really good movie.

252106,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,630141277X,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 6]","There has been a time in most people's lives where they knew they could take on a responsibility if only they were given the chance.  Such is the situation with Melanie Griffith, who has the ability to analyze disparate facts to determine the affect on a business.  However, Melanie, playing secretary Tess McGill, is having trouble being recognized for her ability.  Indeed, new boss Katharine Parker, excellently played by Sigourney Weaver, is stealing the best idea Tess ever had.Near the beginning of this movie Tess receives one blow after another.  She catches her boyfriend fooling around with another woman.  When Tess' boss breaks her leg on a skiing trip and asks Tess to handle a few personal matters, Tess discovers that Katharine has stolen what Tess believes is a great idea, after leading Tess to believe that she has a chance to truly contribute.  Since Katharine will be out for a few weeks until she can fly back from Europe, Tess decides to take her idea back and make it her own.Tess contacts Jack Trainer, wonderfully played by Harrison Ford, a usually no-nonsense businessman who is good at executing business deals.  Of course Tess has to get Jack to believe that she is an experienced executive, and with her plucky fearlessness she leads many of the escapades it takes to get Oren Trask (Philip Bosco) to listen to their plan to buy a string of radio stations.We know that sooner or later someone is going to discover Tess' deception, and the near misses with discovery increase until Tess makes a fatal mistake by leaving her planner in Katharine's apartment.  The movie's pace accelerates substantially until the humorous and satisfying ending.The plot in this nicely paced movie moves along briskly, not allowing you to think too long about the risks that Tess is taking and how unlikely some of the situations might be.  In fact, the plot is careful to make every step as plausible as possible, and I cheered her on from beginning to end.  One of the interesting aspects of how Tess was portrayed is her style.  Tess is blonde and Katharine Parker is brunette.  Tess talks slowly, and at first glance an uninformed person might even think she is also mentally slow, but the contrast to fast talking and arrogant Katharine is intentional so that when Tess' abilities are revealed and her confidence bursts through her normally quiet demeanor we are pleased and just a little surprised.  The execution of this transition is humorously well-handled and effective.This 1988 movie features a heavy cast of well-known actors, including Alec Baldwin as Tess' macho boyfriend Mike Dugan, Joan Cusack as best friend Cyn, Kevin Spacey and Olympia Dukakis, to name a few.  Some of the characters are deliberately campy and stereotypical to heighten the contrast and the humor.The movie was nominated for multiple Oscars, including Best Picture, Actress, and Supporting Actress, but only Carly Simon's excellent song ""Let the River Run"" won.  While the movie is good and worth watching more than once, it is a bit short for Best Picture and Actress.  However, Cusack and Weaver both deserved their nominations for best supporting actress and Weaver especially could have won.Enjoyable watching for those who know they could take only greater challenges if they had the chance, or took the chance, this movie is a humorous winner.",4,Revenge of the Underling,1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,3346,"['been', 'time', 'most', 'people', 'lives', 'where', 'knew', 'could', 'take', 'responsibility', 'only', 'were', 'given', 'chance', 'Such', 'situation', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'who', 'ability', 'analyze', 'disparate', 'facts', 'determine', 'affect', 'business', 'However', 'Melanie', 'playing', 'secretary', 'Tess', 'McGill', 'having', 'trouble', 'being', 'recognized', 'ability', 'Indeed', 'new', 'boss', 'Katharine', 'Parker', 'excellently', 'played', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'stealing', 'best', 'idea', 'Tess', 'ever', 'had.Near', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Tess', 'one', 'blow', 'boyfriend', 'fooling', 'around', 'woman', 'When', 'Tess', 'boss', 'leg', 'skiing', 'trip', 'Tess', 'handle', 'few', 'personal', 'matters', 'Tess', 'Katharine', 'stolen', 'what', 'Tess', 'great', 'idea', 'leading', 'Tess', 'believe', 'chance', 'truly', 'contribute', 'Katharine', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'few', 'weeks', 'can', 'fly', 'back', 'Europe', 'Tess', 'take', 'idea', 'back', 'make', 'own.Tess', 'contacts', 'Jack', 'Trainer', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'usually', 'no-nonsense', 'businessman', 'who', 'good', 'executing', 'business', 'deals', 'course', 'Tess', 'get', 'Jack', 'believe', 'experienced', 'executive', 'plucky', 'fearlessness', 'many', 'escapades', 'get', 'Oren', 'Trask', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'listen', 'plan', 'buy', 'string', 'radio', 'stations.We', 'know', 'sooner', 'later', 'someone', 'going', 'discover', 'Tess', 'deception', 'near', 'misses', 'discovery', 'increase', 'Tess', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'leaving', 'planner', 'Katharine', 'apartment', 'movie', 'pace', 'substantially', 'humorous', 'satisfying', 'ending.The', 'plot', 'nicely', 'paced', 'movie', 'moves', 'along', 'briskly', 'not', 'allowing', 'think', 'too', 'long', 'risks', 'Tess', 'taking', 'how', 'unlikely', 'situations', 'might', 'be', 'fact', 'plot', 'careful', 'make', 'step', 'as', 'plausible', 'possible', 'cheered', 'beginning', 'end', 'One', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'how', 'Tess', 'was', 'portrayed', 'style', 'Tess', 'blonde', 'Katharine', 'Parker', 'brunette', 'Tess', 'talks', 'slowly', 'first', 'glance', 'uninformed', 'person', 'might', 'even', 'think', 'also', 'mentally', 'slow', 'contrast', 'fast', 'talking', 'arrogant', 'Katharine', 'intentional', 'so', 'when', 'Tess', 'abilities', 'are', 'revealed', 'confidence', 'bursts', 'normally', 'quiet', 'demeanor', 'are', 'pleased', 'just', 'little', 'surprised', 'execution', 'transition', 'humorously', 'well-handled', 'effective.This', '1988', 'movie', 'heavy', 'cast', 'well-known', 'actors', 'including', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Tess', 'macho', 'boyfriend', 'Mike', 'Dugan', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'best', 'friend', 'Cyn', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'name', 'few', 'characters', 'are', 'deliberately', 'campy', 'stereotypical', 'heighten', 'contrast', 'humor.The', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'multiple', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Actress', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'only', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'excellent', 'song', 'Let', 'River', 'Run', 'won', 'movie', 'good', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'bit', 'short', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Actress', 'However', 'Cusack', 'Weaver', 'deserved', 'nominations', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Weaver', 'especially', 'could', 'have', 'won.Enjoyable', 'watching', 'who', 'know', 'could', 'take', 'only', 'greater', 'challenges', 'had', 'chance', 'took', 'chance', 'movie', 'humorous', 'winner']",N/A

Melanie Griffith is Tess McGill, a faithful war-horse of a secretary who is exploited and abused by her various employers.  But when she lands a job working for Katherine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) all Tess' woes seem to be at an end - that is, until Katherine steals one of Tess' great ideas for a merger and radio venture.  Here's the wrinkle - Kate breaks her foot skiing and is forced to rely on Tess who, as payback, steals the idea back from Katherine and runs off with the show.  How does it end - with a positive spin, (in short supply these days) a bunch of laughs (equally in short supply) and Harrison Ford (never looking better and playing comedy with a flair that makes one wish he had done more in this genre) making peanut butter and jelly.  Don't ask.  If you've never seen this one you should.FOX VIDEO has given us a non-anamorphic transfer.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that the transfer, despite this one shortcoming, is pretty much a pristine effort.  Colors are dated but bold, rich and vibrant.  Blacks are black.

Tess has a boyfriend, Mick.  She comes from a low class part of New York and allows her temper to get the better of her sometimes, especially when those people deserve it.Then Tess gets a job working for Katherine Parker who acts like she wants to be Tess's friend and mentor.  When Katherine get injured skiing she asks Tess to look after her apartment.  Tess finds out that Katherine plans to steal one of her ideas.  Then she goes home and discovers Mick cheating on her.  Tess decides that it is time that she make some of her own connections and takes over Katherine's job, apartment, and essentially life.Tess meets Jack Trainer and together they start putting together a deal.  Jack has no idea that Tess is a secretary.  Jack and Tess use Tess's opportunistic tactics to get to Oren Trask, so that they can set up a deal for him to buy a radio network.  Jack and Tess end up falling in love.  Tess finds out that Jack is dating Katherine but plans to call it off.On the day of the big meeting Katherine returns home and Tess accidentally leaves her day-planner behind.  Katherine finds out what Tess has been up to and exposes that Tess is a secretary at the meeting.  Katherine takes credit for Tess's idea.Tess gets fired and on the way out she bumps into Jack and confesses the truth that she does love him.  Oren is there and Tess reveals a part of the plan that Katherine overlooked that would have made the radio network worth a lot less.  Oren gets out of the elevator and into another one with Jack and Tess.  Oren hears how Tess came up with the idea and everything else that happened.  When they all get to the same floor Oren asks Katherine how she came up with the idea and knows that Tess has been telling the truth.  Oren informs Katherine that he is going to get her fired.  Oren hires Tess for her shear about of gumption.  Tess ends up with Jack and ends up with an entry level management position at Oren's company.This is a story about someone who goes to extraordinary lengths to get what they want and has the intelliegence and talent to pull it off.

And WORKING GIRL is still a fun and satisfying film about Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith), a working class girl who is trying to realize the American dream. I liked the film back in 1988, and I still like it in 2002, though I now find I have some reservations about the basic premises of the film.But let's start with the strengths. Mike Nichol's film is well-crafted from top to bottom. The screenplay moves along briskly to a satisfying conclusion, as Tess overcomes both prejudice and a deceitful boss in order to realize her ambition of becoming a real business executive. The acting is top-notch across the board. Griffith gave a career performance in this film -- letting us see both the vulnerability and the underlying grit of her character. In the real world, people in her situation are not likely to achieve what Tess achieves, and Griffith shows how frightening Tess' quest would be to someone who didn't know she was in a movie ... Her radiant performance is the heart of the film, but she is well-supported by Harrison Ford (as the not-as-cocky-as-he-seems love interest) and Sigourney Weaver (as the boss from hell). Along the way we catch a lot of famous actors before they hit it big: Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Alex Baldwin, and David Duchovny. Especially memorable is Joan Cusack, who plays Tess' friend, and who manages to steal every scene in which she appears. All of the actors look like they had a blast working on this project.It's impossible not to like WORKING GIRL, but I do have to pause at the underlying values celebrated in the film. First, even as the film sympathetically documents the obstacles that can impede the ambition of talented people born in the working class, it still assumes that being in the working class is somehow a ""failure."" The film never questions Griffith's desire to become a member of the executive class, even as she realizes the levels of deceit and treachery that often exist there. We get no sense that one might find a rich and satisfying life as a secretary, and by making that assumption we are forced to buy into the very class differences the film seems to be critiquing.The film is a celebration of success American-style, which is particularly ironic coming from Mike Nichols, who first made his mark as the director of THE GRADUATE, which indicted the American notion of ""success"" as being ultimately empty and soul-stealing... Where did all that idealism go? I think Carly Simon's Oscar-winning song gives us one clue - it is a hymn to the New Jerusalem. Perhaps the baby boomers' youthful rejection of the ""system"" could not be sustained as long as they had no real idea of what else might be worth pursuing in life.Tess' tenacity and spunk in pursuit of her dreams draw our enthusiastic applause. We are happy ... when we see any human overcome daunting odds. But surely there are better things to aspire to than getting the corner office.",4,A New Jerusalem?,1028246400,"08 2, 2002",2002,3051,"['opening', 'WORKING', 'GIRL', 'set', 'strains', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'Let', 'River', 'Flow', 'still', 'powerful', '14', 'years', 'release', '1988', 'WORKING', 'GIRL', 'still', 'fun', 'satisfying', 'film', 'Tess', 'McGill', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'working', 'class', 'girl', 'who', 'trying', 'realize', 'American', 'dream', 'liked', 'film', 'back', '1988', 'still', '2002', 'now', 'find', 'have', 'reservations', 'basic', 'premises', 'film.But', 'let', 'start', 'strengths', 'Mike', 'Nichol', 'film', 'well-crafted', 'top', 'bottom', 'screenplay', 'along', 'briskly', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'Tess', 'prejudice', 'deceitful', 'boss', 'order', 'realize', 'ambition', 'becoming', 'real', 'business', 'executive', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'board', 'Griffith', 'gave', 'career', 'performance', 'film', 'letting', 'see', 'vulnerability', 'underlying', 'grit', 'character', 'real', 'world', 'people', 'situation', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'achieve', 'what', 'Tess', 'Griffith', 'how', 'frightening', 'Tess', 'quest', 'would', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'movie', 'radiant', 'performance', 'heart', 'film', 'well-supported', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'not-as-cocky-as-he-seems', 'love', 'interest', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'boss', 'hell', 'way', 'catch', 'lot', 'famous', 'actors', 'hit', 'big', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Alex', 'Baldwin', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Especially', 'memorable', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'who', 'Tess', 'friend', 'who', 'steal', 'scene', 'actors', 'look', 'had', 'blast', 'working', 'project.It', 'impossible', 'not', 'like', 'WORKING', 'GIRL', 'do', 'have', 'pause', 'underlying', 'values', 'celebrated', 'film', 'First', 'even', 'film', 'sympathetically', 'documents', 'obstacles', 'can', 'impede', 'ambition', 'talented', 'people', 'born', 'working', 'class', 'still', 'being', 'working', 'class', 'somehow', 'failure', 'film', 'never', 'questions', 'Griffith', 'desire', 'become', 'member', 'executive', 'class', 'even', 'levels', 'deceit', 'treachery', 'often', 'exist', 'there', 'get', 'sense', 'one', 'might', 'find', 'rich', 'satisfying', 'life', 'secretary', 'making', 'assumption', 'are', 'forced', 'buy', 'very', 'class', 'film', 'be', 'critiquing.The', 'film', 'celebration', 'success', 'American-style', 'particularly', 'ironic', 'coming', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'who', 'first', 'made', 'mark', 'director', 'THE', 'GRADUATE', 'indicted', 'American', 'notion', 'success', 'being', 'ultimately', 'empty', 'soul-stealing', 'Where', 'did', 'idealism', 'go', 'think', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'Oscar-winning', 'song', 'one', 'clue', 'hymn', 'New', 'Jerusalem', 'Perhaps', 'baby', 'boomers', 'youthful', 'rejection', 'system', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'sustained', 'as', 'long', 'had', 'real', 'idea', 'what', 'else', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'pursuing', 'life.Tess', 'tenacity', 'spunk', 'pursuit', 'dreams', 'draw', 'enthusiastic', 'applause', 'are', 'happy', 'when', 'see', 'human', 'overcome', 'daunting', 'odds', 'surely', 'are', 'better', 'things', 'aspire', 'getting', 'corner', 'office']",N/A

In her career making performance, she is as charming and perfect for the part today as she was almost 20 years ago. I hope Melanie Griffith will find a role as great as this one in the near future since for the last few years, that one great role has eluded her.The movie follows the potential rise of a competent and ambitious but ""never taken seriously"" secretary in the corporate ladder. The turning point for Tess Mcgill (Griffith) was when she discovered that her boss (Weaver) was about to steal her ""big idea"" and when she caught her boyfriend (Baldwin) in bed with another woman. She schemed her way in order to pitch the idea herself when her boss was away hospitalized due to a skiing accident.Strong performances from the supporting cast especially Joan Cusack (""Sometimes I sing and dance around the house in my underwear. Doesn't make me Madonna. Never will""). Great shots of New York City, and an uplifting soundtrack. They all contribute to the success of the movie.Oh and the ending was perfect.

The borough of Staten Island is the perfect backdrop for a working girl Tess (Melanie Griffith) trying hard to prove her worth in the Manhattan maze of office politics. Scenes of the Staten Island Ferry transporting Tess and thousands of other NYC workers creates a feeling that Tess is trapped by the commuter lifestyle that has defined her life. Griffith gives an uplifting performance as the Staten Island receptionist trying to make her mark in a corporate world driven by manipulation, power, and sexism. Two worlds are explored in the film; one is the $500 a week lifestyle endured by Tess's co-workers and friends and the other is the gilded and privileged society that her boss Kathreen Parker (Sigourney Weaver) lavishly enjoys. Director Nichols's excellent scene selections and wonderful camera work drive these 2 worlds in parallel and clashing courses. All of the lead actors and supporting cast are excellent in their roles and add to the realism of Nichols's direction.

Harrison Ford takes a rare third place in importance, because Sigourney Weaver, as the villain, steals every scene she is in, and really makes the movie successful. Essentially a comedy, this one makes you think about ethics in the workplace, and it isn't just Sigourney who cuts corners in that realm. Many similar plot lines have been filmed, but few have succeeded as much as this one. Repeat screenings are still fun, and that's a rare compliment for me.",4,"Good fun, if you don't moralize about it...",1159315200,"09 27, 2006",2006,555,"['Melanie', 'great', 'look', 'easy', 'root', 'cutthroat', 'business', 'competition', 'story', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'rare', 'third', 'place', 'importance', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'villain', 'steals', 'scene', 'really', 'movie', 'successful', 'Essentially', 'comedy', 'one', 'think', 'ethics', 'workplace', ""n't"", 'just', 'Sigourney', 'who', 'corners', 'realm', 'Many', 'similar', 'plot', 'lines', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'few', 'have', 'succeeded', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'Repeat', 'screenings', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'rare', 'compliment']",N/A
252149,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,630141277X,William,"[3, 3]","This movie is a must have - one that you can watch at least once a year.  It is entertaining with fine performances from Sig Weaver and Melanie Griffith.  Despite Melanie being a very average actor, her style works in this movie.  The type of character required ie. ditzy blonde, meant she could just be herself really.  On top of that, her baby voice works for the role.  Working Girl is a beaut comedy focussing on an unlikely rise to the top, but when you think about it carefully, it shows that anyone, can get to where they want to, if they have the determination and guts.  This is a good message to get across, I feel.  Working Girl could have made Melanie a big star but it didnt quite open the doors she thought it would.  She may have got more roles after this, but not one of them was worth watching!  I refer to flops like Bonfire Vanities, Stormy Monday (plain urgh!), Shining Through, and one with ex hubby Don Johnson - the title escapes me.

I do mean that Cinderella-like quality about Tess (Melanie Griffith), who's swept away from her life as harried office drudge to rising star of the business world. I especially like that she did it herself, with her prince charming (Jack, played by Harrison Ford) helpful and supportive but clearly not the one doing the hard part. And I don't ignore the catty delight to be had in seeing Tess unwittingly steal Jack from the evil stepmother/boss Katharine (Sigourney Weaver).Among many other things, Tess does a great job of showing what it's like to grow into one's success when it comes so suddenly.
