112853,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0790743442,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 18]","There is one problem with watching ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" despite the fact that James Cagney is superb in his underdog sort of role, the title songs and subsequent Americana ditties are toe-tapping from the start, as well as the cinematography and set design are Oscar-worthy - ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" is just too long.  Being a newbie to both the world of Cagney as well as American propaganda, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" seemed the best place to start, and from the opening scene of the birth of George M. Cohan (felt like Fincher borrowed this scene for his ""Benjamin Button"" film) on the 4th of July, there was this immediate attachment.  This film was loud, flashy, and when Cohan began telling his life story to the President of the United States, I eagerly anticipated the results.  Then, we leisurely waked through his life.  When using the word ""leisurely"", it is straightforwardly inescapable.  Be prepared for everything from his family's rise and fall to the eventual birth of every song, no stone is left unturned, and while that can be entertaining - it can also dwindle a great movie into mediocrity.  That is what happened to ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", this viewer went from singing the songs during the day to broodingly waiting for it to finally end.  It was like a rollercoaster, it was at the utmost high, but then went shooting straight down once it was unable to find its ending.""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" is not just this never ending story that repetitively builds too much.  It boasts an Oscar-winning performance for Cagney (who later gets type-cast as this ""Public Enemy""), and it delivers.  It boasts these huge, glorious musical numbers, and it arrives with bells on.  It boasts pure, uncut, raw Americana and it nearly makes you want to stand up and sing.  Thus, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" delivers exactly what one may want from a film like this.  There should be no complains, right?  Again, the length of this film began, as the third act blended into the fourth and so on, felt tedious, boring, melodramatic, and lacking focus.  When Cohan finishes his speech with the President, the ending should have been in plain view.  The long walk down the flight of iconic Presidents, it felt winded.  The final shots were just focus-less.  There should have been a fade to black long before that.  On another note, from the beginning, I knew that Cohan was pure America, it was necessary to consistently repeat that idea.  For example, the scene in which he attempts to join the army was ridiculous.  The merit was there, but the essence of the scene was missing.  Sure, Cohan can tap, but does that mean he should brandish a gun?  Another great example of why ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" began so well, but then felt as if we were stuffing the turkey too full - it was beginning to feel ... dare I say, more American...To complete this discussion, I would like to reiterate again that ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (for the most part) had me tapping my toes and singing right along with the now infamous George M. Cohan.  James Cagney was superb.  His blend of humor, great dance, and exciting dialogue proved that he was more than just his later films.  While this was a semi-ensemble film, each scene that Cagney was in (which was nearly all of them) he stole the scene.  As audience, our eyes were fixated on what this ""average joe"" looking man was about to do next.  Even his dancing seemed original.  Yet, I regretfully admit it was just too long.  The final act just felt flat, and when his conversation with the President ended, it should have faded then - instead the rest of the ""filler"" just felt stale.  I loved this movie, I can suggest it to friends and family, but alas, be prepared for that final moment.  ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" felt like riding a roller coaster too many times, by the end, you just want to get off and savor the fun parts.  By extending it too long, the sloppy ending ruined my savor for this film.  Loved it.  Liked it.  Don't need to watch it again.Grade: ***  out of *****",3,The American Dream; or - Too Much of a Good Thing,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,3998,"['one', 'problem', 'watching', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'fact', 'James', 'Cagney', 'superb', 'underdog', 'sort', 'role', 'title', 'songs', 'subsequent', 'Americana', 'ditties', 'are', 'toe-tapping', 'start', 'as', 'well', 'cinematography', 'set', 'design', 'are', 'Oscar-worthy', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'Being', 'newbie', 'world', 'Cagney', 'as', 'well', 'American', 'propaganda', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'seemed', 'best', 'place', 'start', 'opening', 'scene', 'birth', 'George', 'M.', 'Cohan', 'felt', 'Fincher', 'borrowed', 'scene', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'film', '4th', 'July', 'was', 'immediate', 'attachment', 'film', 'was', 'loud', 'flashy', 'when', 'Cohan', 'began', 'telling', 'life', 'story', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'eagerly', 'anticipated', 'results', 'Then', 'leisurely', 'waked', 'life', 'When', 'using', 'word', 'leisurely', 'straightforwardly', 'inescapable', 'Be', 'prepared', 'everything', 'family', 'rise', 'fall', 'eventual', 'birth', 'song', 'stone', 'left', 'unturned', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'can', 'also', 'dwindle', 'great', 'movie', 'mediocrity', 'what', 'happened', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'viewer', 'went', 'singing', 'songs', 'day', 'broodingly', 'waiting', 'finally', 'end', 'was', 'rollercoaster', 'was', 'utmost', 'high', 'then', 'went', 'shooting', 'straight', 'down', 'once', 'was', 'unable', 'find', 'ending', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'not', 'just', 'never', 'ending', 'story', 'repetitively', 'too', 'much', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Cagney', 'who', 'later', 'type-cast', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'huge', 'glorious', 'musical', 'numbers', 'bells', 'pure', 'uncut', 'raw', 'Americana', 'nearly', 'want', 'stand', 'up', 'sing', 'Thus', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'may', 'want', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'complains', 'right', 'Again', 'length', 'film', 'began', 'third', 'act', 'blended', 'fourth', 'so', 'felt', 'tedious', 'boring', 'melodramatic', 'lacking', 'focus', 'When', 'Cohan', 'speech', 'President', 'ending', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'plain', 'view', 'long', 'walk', 'flight', 'iconic', 'Presidents', 'felt', 'winded', 'final', 'shots', 'were', 'just', 'focus-less', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fade', 'black', 'long', 'note', 'beginning', 'knew', 'Cohan', 'was', 'pure', 'America', 'was', 'necessary', 'consistently', 'repeat', 'idea', 'example', 'scene', 'join', 'army', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'merit', 'was', 'there', 'essence', 'scene', 'was', 'missing', 'Sure', 'Cohan', 'can', 'tap', 'mean', 'should', 'brandish', 'gun', 'great', 'example', 'why', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'began', 'so', 'well', 'then', 'felt', 'were', 'stuffing', 'turkey', 'too', 'full', 'was', 'beginning', 'feel', 'dare', 'say', 'more', 'American', 'complete', 'discussion', 'would', 'like', 'reiterate', 'again', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'most', 'part', 'had', 'tapping', 'toes', 'singing', 'right', 'along', 'now', 'infamous', 'George', 'M.', 'Cohan', 'James', 'Cagney', 'was', 'superb', 'blend', 'humor', 'great', 'dance', 'exciting', 'dialogue', 'proved', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'later', 'films', 'was', 'semi-ensemble', 'film', 'scene', 'Cagney', 'was', 'was', 'nearly', 'stole', 'scene', 'audience', 'eyes', 'were', 'fixated', 'what', 'average', 'joe', 'looking', 'man', 'was', 'do', 'next', 'Even', 'dancing', 'seemed', 'original', 'regretfully', 'admit', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'final', 'act', 'just', 'felt', 'flat', 'when', 'conversation', 'President', 'ended', 'should', 'have', 'faded', 'then', 'instead', 'rest', 'filler', 'just', 'felt', 'stale', 'loved', 'movie', 'can', 'suggest', 'friends', 'family', 'alas', 'be', 'prepared', 'final', 'moment', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'felt', 'riding', 'roller', 'coaster', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'end', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'off', 'savor', 'fun', 'parts', 'extending', 'too', 'long', 'sloppy', 'ending', 'ruined', 'savor', 'film', 'Loved', 'Liked', 'Do', ""n't"", 'need', 'watch', 'again.Grade', '***', '*****']",Yankee Doodle Dandy Classic Musicals Collection  VHS

The story of George M. Cohan is very uplifting.  He wrote many patriotic songs.  James Cagney, known mostly for his performances in gangster movies, finally got a chance to show his singing and dancing talents, which were really his first life and love.

112856,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790743442,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I love how when someone thinks of James Cagney they automatically think of his work on screen as a gangster to the point where when they hear that he actually won an Oscar they assume it is for one of those iconic roles and are somewhat shocked when they hear that it is for a biopic/musical, &#8216;Yankee Doodle Dandy&#8217;.  I was one of those people.  He was a song and dance man?  He did more than talk with a snarl and shoot people?Yes, he did much, much more.I&#8217;ve known this for a while now, and it is precisely why I consider Cagney one of the greatest actors of any generation, but it is something that most people don&#8217;t realize.  And while I&#8217;m one who usually feels like Oscar tends to award actors for their lesser work in more acceptable or commercial fare, I have to say that Cagney&#8217;s win for &#8216;Yankee Doodle Dandy&#8217; is one of the best moves Oscar ever made.  Not only is this Cagney at his finest, but it marked a pinnacle in his career.  After proving himself for quite a few years as a bankable and talented star, albeit typecast for sure, he came forward with his passion project that took him back to his vaudeville roots and earned him the respect of everyone.And rightfully so.&#8216;Yankee Doodle Dandy&#8217; tells the story of George M. Cohan, an arrogant child star who grew up in the vaudeville spotlight only to have his dreams feel somewhat suppressed until he took them by the hand and made them truly grow to the heights of Broadway.  The film beautifully maps out his internal growth as a person and a performer and balances out his flaws with his rousing contribution to the world of song and dance.  I&#8217;ll be honest, when I first saw the poster for this film and read the synopsis, I was not interested.  I&#8217;m not a very political man, and the story seemed ripe for melodrama, but there is something so light and fluid about the way that this film is crafted.  It never forsakes the weight aspects, but it captures everything in such jovial jubilance.  It all feels so compelling, so thoughtful and lighthearted, and the performances by the entire cast truly make for something special.  Cagney is on fire, but his supporting cast like Huston, Leslie, Whorf and DeCamp are all worthy of praise as well.With dazzling sets, beautiful costumes and a script that entertains, educates and builds such intensely detailed characters, &#8216;Yankee Doodle Dandy&#8217; is about as perfect as they come!",5,Cagney is on top of the world!,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,2471,"['love', 'how', 'when', 'someone', 'James', 'Cagney', 'automatically', 'think', 'work', 'screen', 'gangster', 'point', 'where', 'when', 'hear', 'actually', 'won', 'Oscar', 'assume', 'one', 'iconic', 'roles', 'are', 'somewhat', 'shocked', 'when', 'hear', 'biopic/musical', '8216', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', '8217', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'was', 'song', 'dance', 'man', 'did', 'more', 'talk', 'snarl', 'shoot', 'people', 'Yes', 'did', 'much', 'much', 'more.I', '8217', 'known', 'while', 'now', 'precisely', 'why', 'consider', 'Cagney', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'generation', 'something', 'most', 'people', 'don', '8217', 'realize', '8217', 'one', 'who', 'usually', 'feels', 'Oscar', 'award', 'actors', 'lesser', 'work', 'more', 'acceptable', 'commercial', 'fare', 'have', 'say', 'Cagney', '8217', 'win', '8216', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', '8217', 'one', 'best', 'moves', 'Oscar', 'ever', 'made', 'Not', 'only', 'Cagney', 'finest', 'marked', 'pinnacle', 'career', 'proving', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'bankable', 'talented', 'star', 'typecast', 'sure', 'came', 'forward', 'passion', 'project', 'took', 'back', 'vaudeville', 'roots', 'earned', 'respect', 'everyone.And', 'rightfully', 'so.', '8216', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', '8217', 'story', 'George', 'M.', 'Cohan', 'arrogant', 'child', 'star', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'vaudeville', 'spotlight', 'only', 'have', 'dreams', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'suppressed', 'took', 'hand', 'made', 'truly', 'grow', 'heights', 'Broadway', 'film', 'beautifully', 'out', 'internal', 'growth', 'person', 'performer', 'balances', 'out', 'flaws', 'rousing', 'contribution', 'world', 'song', 'dance', '8217', 'be', 'honest', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'poster', 'film', 'read', 'synopsis', 'was', 'not', 'interested', '8217', 'm', 'not', 'very', 'political', 'man', 'story', 'seemed', 'ripe', 'melodrama', 'something', 'so', 'light', 'fluid', 'way', 'film', 'crafted', 'never', 'weight', 'aspects', 'everything', 'such', 'jovial', 'jubilance', 'feels', 'so', 'compelling', 'so', 'thoughtful', 'lighthearted', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'truly', 'make', 'something', 'special', 'Cagney', 'fire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Huston', 'Leslie', 'Whorf', 'DeCamp', 'are', 'worthy', 'praise', 'well.With', 'dazzling', 'sets', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'script', 'educates', 'builds', 'such', 'intensely', 'detailed', 'characters', '8216', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', '8217', 'as', 'perfect', 'come']",Yankee Doodle Dandy Classic Musicals Collection  VHS

112858,AORW1FRF4D4KS,0790743442,azindn,"[3, 3]","Some films should never be remade, they simply are so good they don't need another interpretation. Yankee Doodle Dandy is one of those films. It is the versatile actor, James Cagney's only Oscar- winning performance, and is the standard by which the musical format should be measured. Cagney began his long career in vaudeville and like the main character, George M. Cohan, was Irish-American and a song and dance man.Yankee Doodle Dandy was the most patriotic of WWII films and its flag waving and American ""Over There"" mentality was just the shot in the arm the country needed. Cagney's bigger than life portrayal of Cohan's style of delivery and dancing is not the Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire method of putting over a song, but it is historically correct for the era and artist as well as Cagney himself. If you've never seen the Public Enemy do a buck and wing, this is your opportunity in the extended mid-film production numbers, ""Yankee Doodle/Give My Regards To Broadway."" It is a treat to see the actor transformed into a ballet/tap/ shuffle off to Buffalo dance man that for most audiences is a surprise.Cohan was one of the most prolific and popular Broadway producer, actor, author, and today, his works are almost never remembered or performed except for this film. Every possible patriotic element is utilized in this wonderful family film. It is just the excuse to make one sing aloud, ""Grand Old Flag"" with the cast of boy scouts, civil war, and revolutionary war extras. Backing Cagney on the stage are his real life sister, Jean Cagney playing Cohan's little sister, Josie, elegant Rosemary de Camp and the brilliant actor, Walter Houston as Cohan ma and pa, and Joan Leslie as his wife.

The 125-minute running time flies by, and the film is never once boring.  This energy is due almost entirely to one thing: James Cagney.Cagney tears into the role of George M. Cohan with everything he's got, and just try taking your eyes off of him whenever he's on screen.  He can't sing at all, and he's really more of an acrobat than a dancer, but he pulls off the role of a Broadway showman effortlessly.The rah-rah American sentiments are obviously a product of the time, and little more than World War II propaganda at moments, but I could swallow them easier in this film for some reason.

He was one of the great ""tough guys"" of all time on film, but dancing was his passion, he noted. It shows here. This was ""a labor of love,"" to use a clich?, and it's obvious how much fun he was having in this film. His hoofing talent also was obvious. He was good, very good.In fact, for the audience, most of this movie is pure ""feel good."" Almost all the characters are nice people, the story is inspirational and nicely patriotic and the songs are fantastic. If you pick up this two-disc special-edition DVD that came out several years ago, then you'll see this film in all it's glory. The transfer is magnificent and really brings out the great cinematography. I never realized how beautifully filmed this was until I saw this on DVD.The story is simply the biography of George M. Cohan, the writer and Broadway star of many, many hit plays and hit songs. Unlike today's biographies, this is a very positive story about a man who brought patriotism alive during World War I with such inspirational songs as ""It's A Grand Old Flag"" and ""Over There."" For some of us, listening to these songs can bring a tear or two.Cagney is his normal riveting self and Joan Leslie certainly makes an appealing female lead as Cohan's wife. The great Walter Huston plays Cohan's father. I've always found Huston to be an actor of great presence. In this movie is a very, very touching deathbed scene with he and Cagney.So you have a little bit of everything here from drama to romance to comedy to music and Cagney is the glue to fits it all together beautifully.

Neither star James Cagney or director Michael Curtiz were known for musical endeavors.  This film has no right to work but darned if it doesn't.  It could have been a time capsule curio made to boost morale of the wartime audience.  But it's unapologetic sunniness and patriotism is timeless and in these troubled times we could sure use more of it.  I'm sure some facts of George M.Cohan's life have been embellished but I don't care.  I won't even dare seek out the ""truth"".  The songs reverberate in your head and will stand the test of time.  Arguably Cagney's best role he projects optimism through sheer willpower.

The story follows the life of this young man from his birth to old age and reveals the life of a man who was to impact his country in memorable ways at a critical point in the history of the USA.The role of Cohan is played by James Cagney and was a rather dramatic departure from the gangster roles with which he had become associated. Cagney, who is a remarkable dancer with a rather unique style, handles the role with power and displays the boundless energy which seemed to characterize Cohan's life.Cohen's impact on Broadway and the American musical theater was profound and left a legacy from which we can all benefit.

This year, there's no Boston Pops or movies--except one. Someone at a television station had enough consciousness and caffeine to air ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" today.This is a musical that tells the story of George M. Cohan a singer, songwriter, and playwright who put his love of America in many of his plays in a way that only an American of Irish heritage can.  James Cagney played George M. Cohan with as much verve and more talent than the original. His tap dancing highlights much of the film in which he demonstrates the ability to have his limbs look like they dangle from the strings of a puppet. His performance also won him the Academy Award for best actor. Songs like the ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (of course), It's a Grand Old Flag,"" and ""Over There"" can still give the listener chills of national pride.The story begins with a summons to the White House, George M. tells his story to the president, from his beginnings in Vaudeville, the bonds with his family and partner and his rise to stardom.Rosemary DeCamp, Walter Huston, Jeanne Cagney play his mother, father and sister (who is also his real sister).  Joanne Leslie plays his wife, Mary, and Richard Whorf plays his partner, Sam Harris. They support a script that is a bit campy but reflects the strong bonds the Four Cohans had for each other and his ""contractless"" partnership with Harris. One of the best lines is George M. Cohan marching beside troops who are singing ""Over There,"" a song he wrote. An officer says to him, ""What's the matter, ol' timer, don't you remember this song?""Naturally, the film took license with the facts. Rosemarie DeCamp, who played his mother was nine years younger than (her son), James Cagney. George M. was actually born July 3rd, not the 4th.  He was alos married twice. The last one was named Agnes Mary, but she always went by Agnes.Two years ago I saw George M. Cohan's mausoleum in a cemetery of (other dead)celebrities in Woodlawn, New York. He died in 1942. I eagerly told a much younger man who was an aspiring history teacher. He asked, ""Who's that?"" I told him some of his achievements, perhaps a bit too emphatically. He defended his ignorance telling me he that he was born in 1984, not 1942. I reminded him that being a history teacher meant knowing about people and events before he was born. It doesn't look like he will become one--thank God!Anyway, Happy Birthday, George!

He and his partner kept making musicals and then the Cohans reunited for one last show. Eventually everyone in the family settled down before they died. The only one left was George who was living with his wife. In his final performance, Cohan gets the country to rally around the flag again as he has done his whole life. This movie has many commendable moments but there is an apparent conflict between biography and musical. Cagney for his part gives a stellar performance as the energetic and ambitious Cohan. The film also doubled as a nice piece of propaganda during World War II.",4,Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942),1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,897,"['Starring', 'James', 'Cagney', 'array', 'others', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'writer', 'singer', 'dancer', 'George', 'M.', 'Cohan', 'story', 'older', 'Cohan', 'recounting', 'life', 'story', 'began', 'career', 'family', 'Vaudeville', 'Slowly', 'made', 'name', 'Broadway', 'married', 'love', 'partner', 'kept', 'making', 'musicals', 'then', 'Cohans', 'reunited', 'one', 'last', 'show', 'Eventually', 'everyone', 'family', 'settled', 'down', 'before', 'died', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'was', 'George', 'who', 'was', 'living', 'wife', 'final', 'performance', 'Cohan', 'country', 'rally', 'flag', 'again', 'done', 'whole', 'life', 'movie', 'many', 'commendable', 'moments', 'apparent', 'conflict', 'biography', 'musical', 'Cagney', 'part', 'stellar', 'performance', 'energetic', 'ambitious', 'Cohan', 'film', 'also', 'doubled', 'nice', 'piece', 'propaganda', 'World', 'War', 'II']",Yankee Doodle Dandy Classic Musicals Collection  VHS

Stepping back from the amazing source material and patriotic fervor sweeping the nation at the time it was made, we are left with a solid musical.  Notice I said solid, not perfect.  It is an iconic Cagney film, mostly for the fact that it showed he could do more than play a gangster.  But, there are reasons why Cagney always played a gangster and a thug instead of a dancer and singer.  His singing is average and his dancing steps are... uniquely his (Not a bad thing, but not often replicated).  The film also suffers from some pacing problems and a few of the numbers are weak and seem out of place or just bizarre.  Yes, you can hide behind the fact that it was a biopic, but using the ""based on a true story"" defense is flimsy at best.  The film itself was a patriotic shot in the arm for the 1940s World War Two era and it can be seen by a cynic (I'm nothing if not a cynic) as a two-hour long recruitment film, and I'm sure to some extent it was meant to be.But, I am being quite harsh on it.  The film itself is one of the great musicals, a lot of the numbers and dances are well put together, and the fact that it was directed by Michael Curtiz is a definite point in its favor.  It showcases both Cagney's range as an actor, and Curtiz's range as a director.

And George M. Cohan wrote quite a few.James Cagney's Best Actor performance takes place in flashback in the White House as he is summoned to receive a Medal of Honor for his body of work. He tells his bio to President Franklin Roosevelt, whom he is portraying in his show, ""I'd Rather Be Right.""Cohan describes his early life in Vaudeville, travelling America with his parents and sister, and how he matures and partners with producer Sam Harris. His ups, downs and true loves weave the well-explained circumstances of many of his 80 plays and 500 hit songs. In particular, ""I'm A Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" ""Give My Regards To Broadway,"" ""Mary,"" ""You're A Grand Old Flag,"" and of course, the rousing WWI anthem, ""Over There.""Although Cagney's character is a bit glib and constantly wisecracking, his relationships with family, business associates and competitors are well-defined. And of course, his superb dancing and physical movement may come as a surprise to gangster-movie purists. This is particularly evident in a scene he admittedly ad-libbed near the film's end.Perhaps with America again at war, a classic film like ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" is just what we need to enjoy.",4,Give My Regards To Cagney,1054684800,"06 4, 2003",2003,1313,"['Only', '1942', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'show', 'aging', 'songwriter', 'stepping', 'parade', 'being', 'challenged', 'sing', 'patriotic', 'song', 'wrote', 'George', 'M.', 'Cohan', 'wrote', 'quite', 'few.James', 'Cagney', 'Best', 'Actor', 'performance', 'place', 'flashback', 'White', 'House', 'summoned', 'receive', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'body', 'work', 'bio', 'President', 'Franklin', 'Roosevelt', 'whom', 'portraying', 'show', ""'d"", 'Rather', 'Be', 'Right', 'Cohan', 'early', 'life', 'Vaudeville', 'travelling', 'America', 'parents', 'sister', 'how', 'partners', 'producer', 'Sam', 'Harris', 'ups', 'downs', 'true', 'loves', 'weave', 'well-explained', 'circumstances', 'many', '80', 'plays', '500', 'hit', 'songs', 'particular', ""'m"", 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'Give', 'My', 'Regards', 'Broadway', 'Mary', ""'re"", 'Grand', 'Old', 'Flag', 'course', 'rousing', 'WWI', 'anthem', 'Cagney', 'character', 'bit', 'glib', 'constantly', 'wisecracking', 'relationships', 'family', 'business', 'associates', 'competitors', 'are', 'well-defined', 'course', 'superb', 'dancing', 'physical', 'movement', 'may', 'come', 'surprise', 'gangster-movie', 'purists', 'particularly', 'evident', 'scene', 'admittedly', 'ad-libbed', 'film', 'end.Perhaps', 'America', 'again', 'war', 'classic', 'film', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'just', 'what', 'need', 'enjoy']",Yankee Doodle Dandy Classic Musicals Collection  VHS

Cohan, expertly put over by erstwhile gangster, James Cagney. Cagney had started his show biz career as a hoofer, but later got pegged as a &quot;public-enemy&quot; type, so it probably shocked some of his 1940s audience to see him take to his feet and skip effortlessly across the stage in this remarkable biopic.The story opens with the elderly but still dancing Cohan's getting summoned to the White House on a mysterious visit. President Franklin Roosevelt greets the entertainer and asks him about his life, and then we're off to the land of flashback, as we see George and his parents (dad is Walter Houston) and sis play vaudeville, and then see George strike out on his own as a multitalented composer/performer. And in case you're clueless as to just what Cohan penned, here's just a few: &quot;Give Me Regards to Broadway&quot;, &quot;You're a Grand Old Flag&quot;, &quot;Over There&quot;, &quot;Mary is a Grand Old Name&quot;, &quot;Harrigan&quot;, &quot;Forty-five Minutes from Broadway&quot;, &quot;So Long Mary&quot;, and the eponymous &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;.Cagney is aces as Cohan, giving us a spunky likeable main character who just happens to dance up a storm at the drop of a hat. I once heard a dancer on TV call Cagney's style &quot;eccentric dancing&quot;, a style where the upper body remains straight while the performer hops about on his toes.

He won the Oscar that year for best actor.

Cagney, who got an Oscar for best actor, does an awesome job as Cohan, playing out his cockiness, drive and multi-talented skills (actor, songwriter, playwright, dancer, singer, producer, director, theater owner and choreographer), and, remember, when you see Cagney dancing this was all before the tech we have today that let's you adjust things without redoing the whole scene.  Dialogue is pleasurably snappy. Actors are top notch.  There's a nice history of the stage in this movie as it begins pre 1900 and goes up to the WWII period.  Speaking of which this movie started just a few days before Pearl Harbor and everyone creating this film decided to make it a super patriotic film.  In 2007 the American Film Institute put this movie in the Top 100 and its well deserved. BTW, if you've never heard of Cohan then you probably know him for several of his songs: ""Over There"", ""Give My Regards To Broadway"", ""Yankee Doodle"", ""You're a Grand Old Flag"" ""Harrigan"" and ""Mary's a Grand Old Name"".  MOST MEMORABLE DIALOGUE: George: Oh, I am proud. In fact, I'm flabbergasted. First time in my life, I'm speechless. Are you sure there isn't some mistake? President: Quite sure. George: (modestly) But this medal is for people who've given their lives to their country or done something big. I'm just a song and dance man. Everybody knows that. President: A man may give his life to his country in many different ways, Mr. Cohan. And quite often he isn't the best judge of how much he has given. Your songs were a symbol of the American spirit. Over There was just as powerful a weapon as any cannon, as any battleship we had in the First World War. Today, we're all soldiers, we're all on the front. We need more songs to express America.

Cohan. He's directed by Michael Curtiz, a director who apparently could work in any genre of movie, and produce masterpieces. Pull up his name on imdb and you'll see what I mean.Anyways, the film traces his life from his infant vaudevillian beginnings to his conquering of Broadway. After seeing this, you'll know why there's a statue of Cohan in Times Square.The acting, as expected, is top-notch, with the sweet Joan Leslie as his love interest Mary, Walter Huston as his dad; Cagney's sister plays Cagney's sister...but what will bring you to see this movie again and again are the musical interludes.Cagney is simply spectacular. He is a comet, bouncing around the Broadway stage. His dancing often flirts with straight-out levitation. I swear there are times when his feet fly across the screen...Then consider the songs...""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", ""Mary"", ""Give My Regards to Broadway"" and the most patriotic song I've ever heard, ""Over There.""That song was written for the troops of WW I, and this film was being made when Pearl Harbor was attacked. The way this one song is used in this film, I guarantee, will stay with you forever. And knowing that this movie was made during that time only enhances your experience...but I didn't know it until afterwards, and it made no difference.And that leads to the one thing I feel is overlooked in most reviews of this film: the script. It's has a strong story, great lines, terrific set-pieces and delightful twists. It's funny as all-get-out, and heart-wrenching when you least expect it.The movie is as American as can be...the rags-to-riches rise of the central figure in Broadway history (the Broadway musical being essentially an American creation), the way his family travels to all the new states as they are incorporated...the evolution of New York City...WW I...WW II...it's all here!And from beginning to end, Cohan (and the filmmakers) wear their ""Grand Old Flag"" on their proverbial sleeves, proudly and unabashedly. Patriotism is a definite theme througout the film, rising to dizzying heights right before the credits. Patriotism portrayed simply and honestly, without any hard political bent or satirical edge.The DVD, one of those sweet Warner 2-disc sets, is exemplary...great transfer, nice extras...bravo Warner, again, for treating your classics with respect.It's inarguable: this is one of the great films of all time.

112958,A37B3O457INKEA,0790743442,Peter Kenney,"[5, 5]","YANKEE DOODLE DANDY was released just before the legendary George M. Cohan died from cancer. It was a patriotic movie made during the first year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II. The movie was also a musical with lots of singing and dancing - especially by James Cagney. YANKEE DOODLE DANDY should be respected mostly for its music and dancing and not for its story which was about the life of Cohan. Nobody ever credited the film with much accuracy - including Cohan himself.Cagney considered his role as Cohan to be one of his favorites. It should have been since Cagney began his own show business career as a young hoofer in New York City.The supporting cast of Walter Huston, Joan Leslie, Irene Manning and Rosemary DeCamp was very strong. Cagney's sister Jeanne played the part of Josie Cohan and Frances Langford appeared as a singer. Eddie Foy Jr. made a brief showing as his own real life father, Eddie Foy.YANKEE DOODLE DANDY won Academy Awards for Best Actor (James Cagney), Scoring of a Musical Picture and Sound Recording. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Director (Michael Curtiz), Supporting Actor (Walter Huston), Original Story and Editing. The main competition for Oscars in 1942 came from MRS. MINIVER.

You got it; &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;.  Personally, I would have ranked it higher but I was glad to see it on the list because I was afraid it might have gradually become forgotten.  That would be a shame because this is a well-made movie that's a lot of fun.  It's a real rah rah, rally-round-the-flag movie and it came out at just the right time; 1942.  It tells the story of Gearge M. Cohan who was a real rah rah, rally-round-the-flag kind of a guy.  It fits into the classification of a musical although it is much deeper than that.The greatness of this movie is measured by its' cast with the primary focus going to James Cagney.  Cagney is better known for his tough-guy ganster movies but he was an all around entertainer in this movie.  His singing is adequate for the job and his dancing is very very good.  He's a bit stiff legged at times but the choreography seems to play to that aspect.  It's his acting that raises this movie above the level of the standard musical of that era.  Cagney is a fast-talking, wheeler-dealer who thrives on the spotlight.  He seems to be a better Cohan than George M. himself.  This was Cagney's Oscar-winning performance and a well-deserved award it was.If the movie has a short-coming, it's in the portrayal of his marriage.  Joan Leslie plays his wife in the movie and does a good job in that role.  However, the screenwriters left out any scenes that embellish their relationship beyond that of stage partners.  The absence of children and their formal manner of communication left some wondering why they tied the knot.  However, the pace of this movie leaves little time to ponder such things.  Watch this movie and you'll feel like marching in a parade.

112968,A37S3ACL57LN62,0790743442,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[8, 8]","Yankee Doodle Dandy is the story of the life of Broadway legend George M. Cohan. The film takes us in flashback to his beginning as a cocky kid in ""Peck's Bad Boy"" to the time when he strikes it lucky and gets his first major hit to his later life. The film is long, but it is a showcase for musical number after musical number. Because Cohan himself influenced the film, the information is not all true; Cohan was NOT born on the 4th of July. However, it works for the film because the story is told through the eyes of the elderly Cohan.James Cagney plays Cohan with ease and brilliance. His cockiness translates in his adept dancing and speak-singing which are done similarly to Cohan's true style. The man is brash and funny, a delight to watch.The three major shows, ""Little Johnny Jones,"" ""45 Minutes From Broadway,"" and ""George Washington Jr.,"" are extravagant and fun but each of them actually could have been done on a stage. This is in great contrast to the impossible musical numbers of Busby Berkley.This special edition DVD contains an extra disk of bonus treasures. First, there is a documentary about Cagney's life narrated by Michael J. Fox. It features rare photographs, clips from films like Sinners Holiday, The Public Enemy, Taxi, Lady Killer, Footlight Parade, Here Comes The Navy, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Something to Sing About, Angels With Dirty Faces, The Oklahoma Kid, Yankee Doodle Dandy, The Time Of Your Life, White Heat, Mister Roberts, The Seven Little Foys, and One Two Three. Several people are interviewed including Mae Clark, Virginia Mayo, Brigid O'Brien, Casey Cagney Thomas, Joan Leslie, and Jack Lemmon. The documentary is decent but nothing outstanding; however, I have not seen another about Cagney.There is also a documentary detailing the making of Yankee Doodle Dandy. It outlines George M. Cohan's life and transitions into making the film. It is very good and interesting to watch.One of the cutest parts of the extra features is called ""John Travolta Remembers James Cagney."" It is a short clip that describes how Travolta came to meet and befriend Cagney in the last five years of his life and why he wanted to meet him.

This movie has everything; a great story (perhaps not entirely historically accurate, but hey, this is Hollywood)great dancing/singing and a great cast...It is hard, when given such a plethora of fabulous talent, to isolate one particular scene; nevertheless, here are a few of my favorites: When George meets Mary backstage (this is a riot) for the first time; when George does the dance number that includes literally walking up a wall(!)(Cagney was very limber, to say the least; this move would give Nijinski pause) and the Busby Berkley style Flag number; almost makes you want to enlist! There is a great scene toward the end when Cohan is relaxing on his country farm and some teenagers happen by; they are given a brief lesson in Hollywood newswriting; Cohan has a copy of Variety with the headline ""Stix Nix Hix Pix"" whic he translates for their edification (and fascination) and they are enthralled. And my favorite of all, at the end, the scene in the White House, where ""an ordinary guy"" gets an audience with the President of the United States and dances happily down the White House stairs, to the quiet delight of the staff...to the makers of the film, the actors and the ""real"" players, I say: ""My father thanks you, my mother thanks you, and I thank you..."" for such a great piece of Americana.**NOTE: It is a tragedy that James Cagney and his wife wound up with such a treacherous woman at the end of their lives; she virtually isolated them from their family, doctors, lawyers and friends and took complete, total control of their house and their finances...too bad Cagney couldn't have mustered up one last grapefruit in the face scene. There was a huge spread in Life magazine and it told a harrowing story of the notorious one-time waitress who befriended the Cagneys, insinuated herself into their lives and took terrible advantage of them...a story that defies even Hollywood to tell.",5,"PURE, UNABASHED, FLAG-WAVING PATRIOTISM....",1063065600,"09 9, 2003",2003,1930,"['will', 'love', 'movie', 'everything', 'great', 'story', 'perhaps', 'not', 'entirely', 'historically', 'accurate', 'hey', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'dancing/singing', 'great', 'cast', 'hard', 'when', 'given', 'plethora', 'fabulous', 'talent', 'isolate', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'nevertheless', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'favorites', 'When', 'George', 'Mary', 'backstage', 'riot', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'George', 'dance', 'number', 'literally', 'walking', 'up', 'wall', 'Cagney', 'was', 'very', 'limber', 'say', 'least', 'move', 'would', 'give', 'Nijinski', 'pause', 'Busby', 'Berkley', 'style', 'Flag', 'number', 'almost', 'want', 'enlist', 'great', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'Cohan', 'relaxing', 'country', 'farm', 'teenagers', 'happen', 'are', 'given', 'brief', 'lesson', 'Hollywood', 'newswriting', 'Cohan', 'copy', 'Variety', 'headline', 'Stix', 'Nix', 'Hix', 'Pix', 'whic', 'edification', 'fascination', 'are', 'enthralled', 'favorite', 'end', 'scene', 'White', 'House', 'where', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'audience', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'dances', 'happily', 'White', 'House', 'stairs', 'quiet', 'delight', 'staff', 'makers', 'film', 'actors', 'real', 'players', 'say', 'father', 'thanks', 'mother', 'thanks', 'thank', 'great', 'piece', 'Americana', '**NOTE', 'tragedy', 'James', 'Cagney', 'wife', 'wound', 'up', 'such', 'treacherous', 'woman', 'end', 'lives', 'virtually', 'isolated', 'family', 'doctors', 'lawyers', 'friends', 'took', 'complete', 'total', 'control', 'house', 'finances', 'too', 'bad', 'Cagney', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'mustered', 'up', 'one', 'last', 'grapefruit', 'face', 'scene', 'was', 'huge', 'spread', 'Life', 'magazine', 'told', 'harrowing', 'story', 'notorious', 'one-time', 'waitress', 'who', 'befriended', 'Cagneys', 'insinuated', 'lives', 'took', 'terrible', 'advantage', 'story', 'defies', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'tell']",Yankee Doodle Dandy Classic Musicals Collection  VHS

He always considered himself a song-and-dance man, though you wouldn't know it if you were a fan of his many gangster flicks.  Fred Astaire turned down the role, if you believe the many stories.  And, as much as I love Astaire, the film would have suffered for it.

In YANKEE James Cagney gives the Oscar-winning performance of a lifetime as song-and-dance entertainer and playwright George M. Cohan.  The movie follows him from birth on July 4th in the late 19th Century to receiving a Congressional Medal of Honor at the White House in 1942.  Joan Leslie is his loving wife, Walter Huston is his father, and Richard Whorf is Cohan's business partner.  Written by Robert Buckner and Edmund Joseph and photographed by James Wong Howe, DANDY  really captures America during the 1900-1930 era.The choreography and songs are magnificent--the title song, ""Mary's a Grand Old Name,"" `You're a Grand Old Flag"", ""Only 45 Minutes From Broadway,"" ""Give My Regards to Broadway,"" ""Over  There,"" ""In a Kingdom of Our Own,"" ""Nellie Kelly,"" the list is endless and they are all great.  And Cagney is a wonder, a fabulous singer and dancer.  I never wanted this movie to end.At 126 minutes, it almost doesn't.

112979,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,0790743442,Steven A. Peterson,"[1, 2]","Wow! What a classic movie this is. It's from a different era and probably seems too schmaltzy and contrived. Still, it is a terrific movie in its own terms.James Cagney is a credible song and dance man as he plays the great showman George M. Cohan. His dancing down the stairs of the White House still stuns me when I watch. I can see myself falling down the stairs after the first step!There is a lot of emotional impact to the movie.  The final scene where he is walking down the street with marching troops, readying themselves for leaving for Europe at the outset of America's involvement in World War II. With his own music being played as the troops march. . . .  I still get misty-eyed with that scene.The story itself is pretty standard. The portrait of Cohan, his family, and his friends as his talent propels him upward in the Broadway galaxy of stars and talents.  There are the ups and downs and challenges that face him in the movie. However, as one might guess, he triumphs.Cagney does a great job singing the songs and dancing while portraying Cohan. And those songs. . . . Among the ones that Cagney sings: ""Over There,"" ""Harrigan,"" ""Give My Regards to Broadway,"" ""Mary's a Grand Old Name,"" ""You're a Grand Old Flag,"" and so on. And, of course, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy."" Just a great deal of fun.The other actors provided great support for Cagney's bravura performance. Walter Huston, Joan Leslie, Richard Whorf, Jeanne Cagney (James' sister), Frances Langford. . . .  All acquit themselves nicely.There is a second DVD with all manner of supporting material, but I never get as interested in these add-ons as perhaps I should.

112980,AK61LQI92GTCH,0790743442,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[33, 36]","Jimmy Cagney does it all in YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, the exuberant biography of patriotic song-and-dance man George M. Cohan.  I don't know much about Cohan beyond what I've learned from the film and Rudy Behlmer's commentary and I don't trust that the movie was aiming at a wart's-and-all portrayal, or much cared about historical accuracy.  According to Behlmer Cohan had been married twice and neither wife was named Mary, although sweet Joan Leslie plays Mary Cohan, the film Cohan's one and only wife.  Hollywood's Golden Age bio-pics didn't often stop for the facts, so I guess you can't fault this one for twisting things to fit the story.  Cohan wrote the hit `Mary's A Grand Old Name,' Behlmer tells us, for his daughter.  It fit the movie that Cagney/Cohan wrote it for his then fianc&eacute;e.Cagney won an Oscar for his role in this movie and he pretty much owns the show.  His pleasure is evident in every frame and it's hard not to get caught up in his enthusiasm.  For anyone (like me) who's used to Cagney as a gun-toting gangster YANKEE DOODLE DANDY will come as something of a revelation.  Jimmy can sing (well, he sings no worse than Fred Astaire, anyway) and he can dance.  The highlight of the movie for me were the vaudeville routines and the many production numbers, including `You're a Grand Old Flag,' `Give My Regards to Broadway,' the anthem of World War I `Over There,' and, of course, `The Yankee Doodle Boy.' YANKEE DOODLE DANDY was just beginning filming when Pearl Harbor was attacked, which may account for some of its strong-to-overpowering patriotism.  Still, watching Cagney tap dance down the White House stairs is a treat not to be missed.  Surprisingly, this one's in black-in-white, a format I usually prefer, but if ever a movie begged for a red, white, and blue presentation it's YANKEE DOODLE DANDY.Behlmer's commentary is heavy on the history of the production of the movie, detouring now and then to add tidbits on Cohan's life and career.  It's a pleasant enough approach most of the time, but there's a little too much information on what scene was shot on what day.  The two documentaries on disk two - ""James Cagney: Top of the World"" and ""Let Freedom Sing! The Story of Yankee Doodle Dandy"" are satisfying introductions to the star and the movie (the Cagney documentary is hosted by actor Michael J. Fox).  The disks have plenty of other extras, as well.  An interesting 1943 short ""You, John Jones"" starring Cagney as a volunteer air raid warden over here, three classic Warner cartoons, newsreels, etc.  As usual with the Warner Home Video release I found the extras pertinent to the feature and most welcome.

112981,A3M0YP958H2KRX,0790743442,Steven K. Szmutko,"[0, 0]","Considered by some to be James Cagney's finest performance, YANKEE DOODLE DANDY offers one of the best core ensemble cast with Walter Huston, Joan Leslie, Richard Whorf, and Jeanne Cagney (James' sister) among others.  Filmed in Black and White, this beautifully restored film features Cagney's wide range of talent as he portrays George M. Cohan, the quintessential early 20th century American showman.  Cagney, by all accounts, captures the unique song-and-dance stylings of the original Cohan, yet adds his unique acting abilities in a range of comedic and dramatic scenes.The music is exceptional of course, drawing on Cohan's magnificent repertoire: Yankee Doodle Boy, Over There, Give My Regards to Broadway, You're a Grand Old Flag, and others.  Cagney won a Best Actor award, Walter Huston won for Best Supporting Actor, and the film garnered a bevy of other awards as well.Many younger viewers might give the film short-shrift because of its unabashed patriotism and flag-waving.  This would be a mistake.  The movie accurately captures the tone of Cohan's American showmanship and provides a continually refreshing glimpse into the mind of the 1940s WWII moviegoer.  Beyond that, the tone, photography, and performances are remarkable.The film is a classic!  The two-disc DVD includes several fine documentaries: a Michael J. Fox hosted bio of Cagney; and a recent examination of the movie itself.  The short subject, ""You, John Jones,"" is a bit of wartime propaganda that nicely promotes the importance of vigilance and sacrifice.YANKEE DOODLE DANDY is a fine offering that stands up to repeated viewings.

112985,A2GJ98824GGXGP,0790743442,Timothy Kearney,"[22, 23]","YANKEE DOODLE DANDY is one of the great feel good movies of all time. The movie tells the story of the life of George M. Cohan as told by Cohan himself to Franklin Roosevelt. Though he is proud of himself and his accomplishments, we see in Cohan someone who had great success but also learned from his bumps, bruises, and mistakes. It is a Hollywood extravaganza. There are song and dance numbers, a large all star cast, and it is pure pleasure all the way. The factor that makes the film so special is James Cagney in the role of Cohan. Perhaps because he plays the bad guy so often, we are surprised to see him singing and dancing as a nice guy. Many believe that this role was his best and shows his versatility as an actor. I could not agree more.The movie has historic value. It was released in the early years of World War II, at a time when Americans were confident but unsure as to what would happen in the war. Movies such as YANKEE DOODLE DANDY stirred patriotism at such a critical moment in our history. This becomes especially clear when he received the Congressional Medal of Honor from Roosevelt at the end of the film.The two disc special addition has an added bonus of a disc about Cagney's life hosted by Michael J.

112989,A3CFT5LHFCB46K,0790743442,"""weirdo_87""","[14, 16]","Although he will always be well known for his gangster roles, James Cagney's only Academy Award for Best Actor came for his role as George M. Cohan, the hoofer, singer, dancer, actor and playwright portrayed in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"". One might suspect that Cagney only won the Oscar because the Academy would never have given it to one of his gangster roles. Or maybe, it was because this film was just what the country needed in the early days of World War II. Or maybe, the academy actually was recognizing Cagney's abilities as an actor. Whatever the reason, Jimmy deserved the award. Who ever knew he could do that kind of footwork and even sing!Now, let's get to George Cohan, who's ""A good friend of my Uncle Sam"" and was ""Born on the Fourth of July"". Because of this, Cohan was immensely patriotic and wrote many flag waving tunes. Many of you are still stumped about his name, but you would probably know his songs if you heard them: ""Mary"", ""Give My Regards to Broadway"", ""Harrigan"", ""45 Minutes from Broadway"", ""Over There"" and, of course, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"".The music numbers, since they are stage productions, lack the Hollywoodized touch that's in ""Singin' in the Rain"". Nevertheless, they are still exciting enough. A great supporting cast assists Cagney, including Walter Huston, Joan Leslie, Richard Whorf, Irene Manning, George Tobias, Rosemary De Camp, Eddie Foy Jr. and Jeanne Cagney (His own sister!). The film's direction was helmed by Michael Curtiz, responsible for such classics as ""Casablanca"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and Cagney in ""Angels With Dirty Faces"". Curtiz puts into the movie his traditional blend of thrills and fast pace. The screenplay is full of memorable scenes and dialogue, particularly ""My mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you and I thank you"". About the only problems with it are moments of melodrama and how it might trivialize some of the events in Cohan's life. I also did not like how the script skips in telling us how Cohan's mother and sister died. But, with all the virtues of the movie, these problems are minor. It also shows to never learn your history from movies.The version I watched ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" on was the controversial colorized edition created in the late 1980's, one of several movies that received such treatment. The movie doesn't look too bad in color. It's one of a very few movies that can be switched between either version. Nevertheless, if Ted Turner really wanted to see a black and white movie in color, he should have made a remake. Either that or he should have had the cooperation of someone who was involved in the making of the movie. Don't tamper with someone else's work unless you have their discrete!So, if you happen to see this available for rent or sale at your local video store, don't hesitate (Unless it's in color, that is).
