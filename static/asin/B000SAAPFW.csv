1085707,A2X29H96X7C3XJ,B000SAAPFW,"Blue in Washington ""Barry Ballow""","[1, 1]","""Times Have Been Better"" is the story of a middle-class French family confronting a collection of long-simmering relationship problems in the aftermath of the much admired older son's announcement that he's gay.  Just about everything about this film is intelligent and insightful (with the exception of the inept disc cover graphic.)  All of the characters--gay son, younger brother, mother, father and assorted friends--are presented as real human beings owning a wide variety of hang ups, ambitions, egos and ongoing disappointments.  Reliance on traditional coming out story cliches and stereotypes is generally well and creatively avoided in this particular family story, much to the benefit of the screenplay and the enjoyment of the viewer.  The film's characters all eventually wise up in this film, but in plausible and intelligent ways.  Interesting that this film was conceived and made in France.  It's doubtful that the same effort could come out of Hollywood or even as an Indie production where these subjects have almost always been cliche-bound and focused on physical beauty over basic human behavior.",5,Good-hearted and smart,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,1119,"['Times', 'Have', 'Been', 'Better', 'story', 'middle-class', 'French', 'family', 'confronting', 'collection', 'long-simmering', 'relationship', 'problems', 'aftermath', 'much', 'admired', 'older', 'son', 'announcement', 'gay', 'Just', 'everything', 'film', 'intelligent', 'insightful', 'exception', 'inept', 'disc', 'cover', 'graphic', 'characters', 'gay', 'son', 'younger', 'brother', 'mother', 'father', 'assorted', 'friends', 'are', 'presented', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'owning', 'wide', 'variety', 'hang', 'ups', 'ambitions', 'egos', 'ongoing', 'disappointments', 'Reliance', 'traditional', 'coming', 'out', 'story', 'cliches', 'stereotypes', 'generally', 'well', 'creatively', 'avoided', 'particular', 'family', 'story', 'much', 'benefit', 'screenplay', 'enjoyment', 'viewer', 'film', 'characters', 'eventually', 'wise', 'up', 'film', 'plausible', 'intelligent', 'ways', 'Interesting', 'film', 'was', 'conceived', 'made', 'France', 'doubtful', 'same', 'effort', 'could', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'even', 'Indie', 'production', 'where', 'subjects', 'have', 'almost', 'always', 'been', 'cliche-bound', 'focused', 'physical', 'beauty', 'basic', 'human', 'behavior']",Times Have Been Better
1085708,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000SAAPFW,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[19, 19]","In the French made-for-TV film ""Le Ciel sur la tte"" (""Times Have Been Better"") (2006), J&eacute;r&eacute;my is 30 year old son of liberal upper middle class parents Guy and Rosine, who comes home in order to tell his parents about his impressive promotion at his work in Paris ... and to finally tell them that he is gay.  His younger brother, Robin, who has known about his brother's sexuality for years, warns him that they are going to be stunned by the news, but neither one of them could have anticipated just how it would affect the relationships between each one of the four family members.I found this to be a refreshing change on the usual ""coming out"" tale, on several levels.  Obviously, the son is no longer a child, but an adult who finished college and is a success in the business world, but whom has been procrastinating about telling his parents until he was in a relationship, which he is now.  And, from that point, the gay son actually becomes more of a supporting character, as the film concentrates more on the resulting tension between the parents and also the younger son, who unfortunately decides around the same time to postpone college to take a temp job for a film studio. While the initial troubles between the parents seem to have been triggered by the revelation of the son's sexuality, it also soon becomes obvious that the problems are buried much deeper than that, and have existed through most of their marriage.  The turmoil of the relationship also alienates good friends of both Guy and Rosine, and pushes Rosine to seek out advice and support from her gay co-worker, whom she doesn't particularly like.  The film is a light but intelligent reminder about how important communication is in any relationship, and how being ""open minded"" is often tougher than it seems.DVD has brief ""making of"" featurette (dubbed in English, although the film itself is in French with subtitles, and may need some pausing and replays, since the dialogue comes through pretty fast at times.) and photo gallery.

Kudos to all those involved in the production of this French film. The acting, the writing, the direction, casting, etc., are combined deftly into one superior film. I have nothing but praise for this film and I'm sure it will be remembered as a classic in years to come. The writing is top notch; this film has it all-- drama, humor and true emotion. This is a family that is completely believable to watch. There is not a false moment or performance to be found.

But just by seeing how they were reacting to each other as they were filming and how the actors and actresses all worked together to bring across a movie that while funny and dramatic.  Also has some scenes that get you pissed again i'm not one to go telling specific scenes in the movie.  But i will say that the father of the older son first seems cool with his son telling him and mother that he's gay.But as you progress further into the film he starts losing it, lashing out, slapping his younger son (also a delight to watch in this movie) for something about the lawn.  it is interesting to see how folks really react and feel to a situation not what they are thinking and think that person wants to hear.  It just came across so well and made a huge impression on me long after it was over.  I cant help hope to see all the people in this movie again in something as good as Times Have Been Better.

1085713,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000SAAPFW,Grady Harp,"[18, 19]","TIMES HAVE BEEN BETTER (Le Ciel sur la tte) is a polished little French 'made for television' film that holds its own on every level in the theater and on DVD. The issues it tackles are many, not just the main topic of coming out to a family. This is one of the better, more fully rounded examinations of the contemporary family in recent years.  Based on a story and screenplay by  Nicholas Mercier and directed by R&eacute;gis Musset, this is a sophisticated comedy with some sensitive dramatic overtones presented by a fine cast and superb production values.J&eacute;r&eacute;my (Arnaud Binard) is the wholly successful business executive son of Rosine (the amazingly fine actress Charlotte de Turckheim) and Guy (Bernard Le Coq) and big brother to Robin (Olivier Gu&eacute;rit&eacute;e). When he pays a surprise visit to his home for an impromptu brunch, his family is in fine spirits until the reason for the surprise visit is made known: J&eacute;r&eacute;my announces to his parents that he is gay and though Robin has known this fact for some time and Rosine has suspected it, the news hits the family unit by storm.  J&eacute;r&eacute;my returns to Paris to his partner Marc (Pierre Deny) and while relieved that he can now live his life in the open, J&eacute;r&eacute;my frets about the trauma to his family unit. Robin gathers the courage to rebel against going to college in favor of following his dream of being involved with cinema, Guy goes into a true depression, and Rosine decides to face the new life of her son, traveling to Paris to meet her son's home and friends and fresh outlook.  While in Paris Rosine discovers her own suppressed needs and with the courage J&eacute;r&eacute;my has shown, she is able to return to her home an altered person.The cast is very attractive and very fine and story flows so naturally, completely without clich&eacute;, that the movie becomes more a study of human behavior than of a routine 'coming out' movie.

It's as much if not more a journey of the parents than of the child. The director, in the DVD extras, says as much, when he confesses that the gay son Jeremy, probably has the least interesting role in the cast. The eruption that results from Jeremy's news is more an exploration of the various reactions and the collisions of conscience and kindness the main characters have with eachother as a result. I particularly loved the idea that even though the parents are perceived by their children as left-wing liberal their reactions to their son's coming out are unexpected given their political stripe and their perception of themselves. The unexpectedness of the reactions and their emotional core are what make the script believable and the performances by Charlotte de Turckheim and Bernard Le Coq as mother and father, really are the centre of this story.

1085720,A1ADZQOL0PLBEW,B000SAAPFW,Scadhog,"[1, 1]","Very smart, very funny, and ultimately very touching coming out film, from director R&eacute;gis Musset.  Jeremy (Arnaud Binard), a successful young businessman, finally informs  his parents he is gay.  Refreshingly, this movie focuses not on an angst-ridden son (he is, in fact, the most well-adjusted member of the family) but rather on the effect his announcement has on his parents, Guy (Bernard Le Coq) and Rosine (Charlotte de Turckheim).  Supposedly liberal, they find it very difficult to accept that their son is gay, especially his father.  Poor Jeremy has to contend with a rebellious younger brother, and the collapse of his parent's marriage.Although this is a gay-themed movie, Jeremy and his boyfriend actually appear very little in the movie.The entire cast is wonderful, with Chantal Ladesou as Rosine's outspoken, chain-smoking best friend, and Franck de la Personne as Rosine's flamboyant co-worker, especially good.  But the film belongs to de Turckheim as a mother who finally comes to accept her son, her husband, and most importantly herself.  She is superb.For anyone who wants to enjoy a witty, sophisticated comedy that only the French (or, sadly, just about any country other than America) can make, ""Times Have Been Better"" is a must-see.",5,Not your usual coming out film,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,1266,"['Very', 'smart', 'very', 'funny', 'ultimately', 'very', 'touching', 'coming', 'out', 'film', 'director', 'R', 'eacute', 'gis', 'Musset', 'Jeremy', 'Arnaud', 'Binard', 'successful', 'young', 'businessman', 'finally', 'parents', 'gay', 'Refreshingly', 'movie', 'not', 'angst-ridden', 'son', 'fact', 'most', 'well-adjusted', 'member', 'family', 'rather', 'effect', 'announcement', 'parents', 'Guy', 'Bernard', 'Le', 'Coq', 'Rosine', 'Charlotte', 'de', 'Turckheim', 'Supposedly', 'liberal', 'find', 'very', 'difficult', 'accept', 'son', 'gay', 'especially', 'father', 'Poor', 'Jeremy', 'contend', 'rebellious', 'younger', 'brother', 'collapse', 'parent', 'marriage.Although', 'gay-themed', 'movie', 'Jeremy', 'boyfriend', 'actually', 'appear', 'very', 'little', 'movie.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'Chantal', 'Ladesou', 'Rosine', 'outspoken', 'chain-smoking', 'best', 'friend', 'Franck', 'de', 'la', 'Personne', 'Rosine', 'flamboyant', 'co-worker', 'especially', 'good', 'film', 'belongs', 'de', 'Turckheim', 'mother', 'who', 'finally', 'accept', 'son', 'husband', 'most', 'importantly', 'superb.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoy', 'witty', 'sophisticated', 'comedy', 'only', 'French', 'sadly', 'just', 'country', 'other', 'America', 'can', 'make', 'Times', 'Have', 'Been', 'Better', 'must-see']",Times Have Been Better
