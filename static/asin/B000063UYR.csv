696082,A3S1XQIKDYXTQE,B000063UYR,"DJG ""Dog Lover""","[0, 0]","This is a great dvd. I recommend for anyone wanting to learn some basic Spanish. For instance, they show you three different ear pictures, then they tell you the word in Spanish (3x).  They teach you colors, they teach you to count, they teach you some basic everyday words.  And, you know what?  When the video is over, you are going to know some Spanish, much to your amazement. This is a great Spanish teaching video whether the child is 2, or you are 100.  Highly, highly recommend it.  For some reason, I was able to remember much of what they taught, and I am 68.  So get this video, asap.",5,Espaniol Bebe,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,595,"['great', 'dvd', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'learn', 'basic', 'Spanish', 'instance', 'show', 'three', 'different', 'ear', 'pictures', 'then', 'tell', 'word', 'Spanish', '3x', 'teach', 'colors', 'teach', 'count', 'teach', 'basic', 'everyday', 'words', 'know', 'what', 'When', 'video', 'over', 'are', 'going', 'know', 'Spanish', 'much', 'amazement', 'great', 'Spanish', 'teaching', 'video', 'child', '2', 'are', '100', 'Highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'reason', 'was', 'able', 'remember', 'much', 'what', 'taught', 'am', '68', 'So', 'get', 'video', 'asap']",N/A

The Brainy Baby one is longer, 45 minutes compared to 30 minutes for bilingual baby. The content is structured differently. As an infant and toddler my daughter liked bilingual baby, but now she prefers the Brainy Baby version. There is a more extended vocabulary and there is some review of the familiar basic words from the first video. There is some footage in both, but they are certainly different!",5,Excellent Learning Tool,1053475200,"05 21, 2003",2003,532,"['have', 'Small', 'Fry', 'bilingual', 'baby', 'tape', 'Spanish', 'also', 'have', 'Brainy', 'Baby', 'Spanish', 'DVD', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'tape', 'Brainy', 'Baby', 'one', 'longer', '45', 'minutes', 'compared', '30', 'minutes', 'bilingual', 'baby', 'content', 'structured', 'differently', 'infant', 'toddler', 'daughter', 'liked', 'bilingual', 'baby', 'now', 'Brainy', 'Baby', 'version', 'more', 'extended', 'vocabulary', 'review', 'familiar', 'basic', 'words', 'first', 'video', 'footage', 'are', 'certainly', 'different']",N/A

Buentello,"[124, 126]","When I saw one of the very negative reviews, I thought this person was exaggerating given that I had bought the Brainy Baby for French DVD and thought it was really good (quality and all), but I needed to buy an educational DVD for my 18 mo. old daughter in Spanish since is too my very first mother tongue. I decided to buy this DVD, specially because there are not many out there of this kind. When I saw it, I thought it wasn't that bad. It does have accents where there should be, and question marks (Did this person referred to an old version?) However, they did use a couple of words that I would not use in spanish so it's useless to teach a toddler words she would not use, like the word for ball (pelota), they used ""bola"". I think pelota is more widely used, not just in Mexico. That is my only criticism; they should have used a term that is common for many countries, so I think they should have done a little more research and the narrator would be fine. Her pronunciation is fenomenal (regardless whether or not she is a native speaker, it doesn't matter!). The content of the video is great, just what a toddler needs to learn a language in a fun way. My daughter enjoyed this DVD from beginning to end. It's just good enough to entertain my daughter without mindless TV cartoons.",4,Some bad Spanish....but good video,1075852800,"02 4, 2004",2004,1295,"['When', 'saw', 'one', 'very', 'negative', 'reviews', 'thought', 'person', 'was', 'exaggerating', 'given', 'had', 'bought', 'Brainy', 'Baby', 'French', 'DVD', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'quality', 'needed', 'buy', 'educational', 'DVD', '18', 'mo', 'old', 'daughter', 'Spanish', 'too', 'very', 'first', 'mother', 'tongue', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'specially', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'there', 'kind', 'When', 'saw', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'have', 'accents', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'question', 'marks', 'Did', 'person', 'referred', 'old', 'version', 'However', 'did', 'use', 'couple', 'words', 'would', 'not', 'use', 'spanish', 'useless', 'teach', 'toddler', 'words', 'would', 'not', 'use', 'word', 'ball', 'pelota', 'used', 'bola', 'think', 'pelota', 'more', 'widely', 'used', 'not', 'just', 'Mexico', 'only', 'criticism', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'term', 'common', 'many', 'countries', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'little', 'more', 'research', 'narrator', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'pronunciation', 'fenomenal', 'regardless', 'not', 'native', 'speaker', ""n't"", 'matter', 'content', 'video', 'great', 'just', 'what', 'toddler', 'learn', 'language', 'fun', 'way', 'daughter', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'beginning', 'end', 'just', 'good', 'enough', 'entertain', 'daughter', 'mindless', 'TV', 'cartoons']",N/A

She is in a bilingual class once a week with Boca Beth materials but this DVD got better reviews so I bought this one.  She likes it but only for about 20 mins and then she asks to watch something else.  Her attention span at the class is short too - maybe too much new stuff at once??,3,Seems good but can't say for sure,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,330,"['bought', '21', 'month', 'old', 'daughter', 'bilingual', 'class', 'once', 'week', 'Boca', 'Beth', 'materials', 'DVD', 'got', 'better', 'reviews', 'so', 'bought', 'one', 'only', 'about', '20', 'mins', 'then', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'attention', 'span', 'class', 'short', 'too', 'maybe', 'too', 'much', 'new', 'stuff', 'once']",N/A
