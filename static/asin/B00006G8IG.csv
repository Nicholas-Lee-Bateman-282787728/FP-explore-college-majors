715189,A1KEJZHXMI25PK,B00006G8IG,"Assata A. Knox ""Literary Fool""","[1, 1]","This movie was very well acted by a cast of talented actors and actresses, particularly Angela Bassett in the titular role of Ruby Delacroix.  The story is ultimately a story about searching for freedom--leaving an all-too-familiar place, both figuratively and literally.  This is embodied in Emerald Delacroix (Jurnee Smollett), Ruby's fifteen-year-old daughter who knows and understands that both she and her mother are meant for more than their small town in Louisiana.  The struggle between them is Ruby's initial reluctance to embrace change, while Emerald refuses to settle.  There's also Earl Delacroix (Brian Stokes Mitchell), who coldly rejects his wife and her small-town ways.  Upon further examination, we learn that Earl has left his family because of a need to explore his options outside of their small town (Emerald takes after her father in this regard; in fact, in their last conversation, he tells her that she's ""just as good as anybody else; even better than most"").  It is Billy Dupre who finally challenges views that Ruby has held close to her heart and gets her to step outside of her comfort zone.  Even though things end tragically for them, it gives Ruby the courage to break free of societal restraints and leave her hometown and do what she wants to do, once and for all.  The movie ends with Ruby and Emerald leaving their hometown behind, free to live their lives the way they see fit--and not how their racist society feels they should.",5,"Stellar cast, winning combination...",1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,1469,"['movie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'cast', 'talented', 'actors', 'actresses', 'particularly', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'titular', 'role', 'Ruby', 'Delacroix', 'story', 'ultimately', 'story', 'searching', 'freedom', 'leaving', 'all-too-familiar', 'place', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'embodied', 'Emerald', 'Delacroix', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', 'Ruby', 'fifteen-year-old', 'daughter', 'who', 'mother', 'are', 'meant', 'more', 'small', 'town', 'Louisiana', 'struggle', 'Ruby', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'embrace', 'change', 'Emerald', 'settle', 'also', 'Earl', 'Delacroix', 'Brian', 'Stokes', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'coldly', 'wife', 'small-town', 'ways', 'further', 'examination', 'learn', 'Earl', 'left', 'family', 'need', 'explore', 'options', 'small', 'town', 'Emerald', 'father', 'regard', 'fact', 'last', 'conversation', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'anybody', 'else', 'even', 'better', 'most', 'Billy', 'Dupre', 'who', 'finally', 'views', 'Ruby', 'held', 'close', 'heart', 'step', 'comfort', 'zone', 'Even', 'things', 'end', 'tragically', 'Ruby', 'courage', 'break', 'free', 'societal', 'restraints', 'leave', 'hometown', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'once', 'movie', 'Ruby', 'Emerald', 'leaving', 'hometown', 'free', 'live', 'lives', 'way', 'see', 'fit', 'not', 'how', 'racist', 'society', 'feels', 'should']",N/A

Set in the segregated sixties in a bayou town, Angela Bassett and Kevin Anderson star as Ruby, the owner of her own juke joint and married to a man who has distanced himself from her, both emotionally and physically.  Her 15-year-old daughter, Emerald, feels she is too good to be a part of her mother's life and the town she stays in.  Kevin's Billy Dupree is a talented white blues singer, married to a woman he loves, but is not in love with, due to the guilt they both feel after the death of their son.  Glenn Plummer also stars as Johnny, the guitarist of the band that performs their regularly.  He is trying to live the  life that makes his family happy, while keeping his desire for someone else under wraps.  It's these complex relationships that propel the movie along, and Angela Bassett is to be commended for turning in a supurb performance of a woman who wants more out of her life than what she feels she is expected to have and nothing more, even if it's with someone who could get her killed.

Ruby's Bucket of Blood is entertaining and interesting but too many elements side swap the romance. The romance between Ruby ( Bassett ) and Kevin Anderson ( I can't believe I forgot the character's name ) has great potential but takes the entire movie to get started. Then when it finally gets going the movie is over. The romance didn't build properly. The characters didn't learn enough about one another. There were missing scenes that allowed them to grow. You really need to show that growth when you're doing a romance especially an interracial one. So I was disappointed that we didn't see more Angela and Kevin scenes. I thought the film was supposed to be about Ruby, her husband and being in love with a white man but it turned into jamborees at her club.
