1090643,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000TJ6PC4,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[5, 6]","Surprisingly, I am enjoying the Little People Big World.  The show features a mixed stature family from Oregon, Matt and Amy Roloff, twins Zach and Jeremy; Molly and Jacob.  The parents and one child, the twin Zach, are born little people.Since Matt spent much of his youth in hospitals, his dreams as a child have become real with his family.  Matt is entrepreneurial, a doer (or more like a supervisor of the doers) and inspirational and this little man is committed to his dreams, his challenge to life.  With health issues, his physical work is limited.On the 34-acre farm, what child would not have enjoyed that magical and playful spread that includes a Pirate Ship, Tree House  and a Western Town.  The farm brings in money from corporate parties, tours, selling peaches, etc.,Amy, more of a realist than Matt, works two jobs, one being a soccer coach.  The house is a mess and Zach can be a little pill with his lack of respect to his dad at times. Season one shows a camping trip with the boys and friends, driver's license, etc.But you can enjoy life through the eyes of the Roloff family.  Although I never did see the TLC show, I enjoy having a first view through DVD....Rizzo",5,"Engaging, inspirational, fun",1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,1188,"['Surprisingly', 'am', 'enjoying', 'Little', 'People', 'Big', 'World', 'show', 'mixed', 'stature', 'family', 'Oregon', 'Matt', 'Amy', 'Roloff', 'Zach', 'Jeremy', 'Molly', 'Jacob', 'parents', 'one', 'child', 'twin', 'Zach', 'are', 'born', 'little', 'people.Since', 'Matt', 'spent', 'much', 'youth', 'hospitals', 'dreams', 'child', 'have', 'become', 'real', 'family', 'Matt', 'entrepreneurial', 'doer', 'more', 'supervisor', 'doers', 'inspirational', 'little', 'man', 'committed', 'dreams', 'challenge', 'life', 'health', 'issues', 'physical', 'work', 'limited.On', '34-acre', 'farm', 'what', 'child', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'magical', 'playful', 'spread', 'Pirate', 'Ship', 'Tree', 'House', 'Western', 'Town', 'farm', 'money', 'corporate', 'parties', 'tours', 'selling', 'peaches', 'etc.', 'Amy', 'more', 'realist', 'Matt', 'two', 'jobs', 'one', 'being', 'soccer', 'coach', 'house', 'mess', 'Zach', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'pill', 'lack', 'respect', 'dad', 'times', 'Season', 'one', 'camping', 'trip', 'boys', 'friends', 'driver', 'license', 'can', 'enjoy', 'life', 'eyes', 'Roloff', 'family', 'never', 'did', 'see', 'TLC', 'show', 'enjoy', 'having', 'first', 'view', 'DVD', '.Rizzo']",N/A

There is also an education that goes along with this show, at least for me it is an education. There are two dwarf parents, Amy and Mat. They are parenting four kids. 15/16 year old twins. One tall boy & one Dwarf boy. A 12/13 year old girl normal height and a 9/10 year old boy normal height. It is a chore when parenting the twins. Especially when the taller twin starts to talk back and the dwarf twin analyzes everything the father does in trying to get the taller twin to do the work needed. Mat really needs be married to Amy. She is the reason, the master mind behind the parenting. Matt is usually there to get things done, but there are times Amy needs to finesse the work her husband does.",5,A Fun family to watch.,1195689600,"11 22, 2007",2007,728,"['fun', 'show', 'watch', 'also', 'education', 'along', 'show', 'least', 'education', 'are', 'two', 'dwarf', 'parents', 'Amy', 'Mat', 'are', 'parenting', 'four', 'kids', '15/16', 'year', 'old', 'twins', 'One', 'tall', 'boy', 'one', 'Dwarf', 'boy', '12/13', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'normal', 'height', '9/10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'normal', 'height', 'chore', 'when', 'parenting', 'twins', 'Especially', 'when', 'taller', 'twin', 'talk', 'back', 'dwarf', 'twin', 'everything', 'father', 'trying', 'get', 'taller', 'twin', 'do', 'work', 'needed', 'Mat', 'really', 'be', 'married', 'Amy', 'reason', 'master', 'mind', 'parenting', 'Matt', 'usually', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'are', 'times', 'Amy', 'finesse', 'work', 'husband']",N/A
1090645,A2RUUTTFJQ7CBH,B000TJ6PC4,Anton Tobias,"[26, 27]","I'm going to let you in on a little secret...I hate reality television.  Come to think of it, television programming in general has been on a fast decline for awhile now.  It has become (at least for me) increasingly difficult to find something to watch without becoming bored.  Reality T.V. is laced with too much ham, sitcoms are unbearably lame, and action shows are just insulting to my intelligence.  With all this worthless debris cluttering the television waves it was a blessing to find Matt Roloff and his family.Being a fan of the show and not wanting to spend $21.95 on the outrageously priced individual episode DVDs I found myself playing the waiting game for a full season DVD to grace the local department store shelves.  Today the wait was over...Season One is a three disc DVD set, the only downside to this is the packaging.  It is made entirely of recycled cardboard with the DVDs having to be ""slipped"" in and out of place.  A nice improvement would have been a plastic backing for the discs to sit in...this way the DVDs wouldn't have to rub against the cardboard everytime the discs are removed and returned to the case.I was also surprised to see that out of the 20 episodes included in this set the pilot episode, entitled ""Little People, Big Dreams"" was absent.  This is particularly important because this was the hour long episode that introduced us to the Roloff family back in March of 2005.  I don't understand why this episode is excluded from this set considering the significance it carried.Little People, Big World (Season One) gets a well-deserved 4 stars.  Although the case was somewhat generic and the pilot epsiode missing I found the rest of the DVD set very well put together and the price very reasonable.Episode Listing:DISC 11. Living Little2.

1090651,A1NW04AD2WTUDY,B000TJ6PC4,Rosie,"[5, 6]","The premise of this show is how people who are different assimilate into a world not made for them. Watching the Roloffs--a family of six, three of whom are dwarves and three of whom are of average size--will give you the answer: Very well, thank you.This is the most realistic family show out there, and this family--despite having what some people may consider shortcomings (no pun intended)--are as genuine and typical as any family of six can be. I love watching them interact (sometimes politely, sometimes not so much so), deal with life's disappointments, revel in the good stuff, and just be themselves.Everyone I've told about this show has become hooked, because it's so interesting to see how the Roloffs deal with what some of us average-height individuals take for granted, from shopping at the grocery store, to driving a car, to cleaning the house.  But what is really amazing is how much they are just typical people. This is the greatest appeal of ""Little People, Big World."" Size doesn't matter.

They're funny little buggers running around like broken toys, with swollen heads and helium-induced voices. So I heard about this show and started watching, laughing myself week-after-week. Watching Amy create stools to climb on so she can reach stuff in the kitchen, or Matt burn rubber as he carts around in his scooter, and Zach running around in his Civil War hat with his little, crooked legs had me in tears!!Now before you go bashing me as insensitive, know that I've learned a lot from this show. As Matt says in his opening monologue he hopes people can learn that they do everything other people do, but in a different way. This is your typical white family who live on a farm, argue over spending money they don't have on things they don't really need, raising kids who are getting ready to leave home (except for Jacob who's got a few years to go) and learn who they are, and Matt the dad, who's a control freak and must be in on every aspect of the business and household, monitoring the work while he swings on his crutches; I absolutely love when he does that!The music for this show reminds me a lot ofThe Simsvideo game, especially during the part where you build or make additions to your house. It's very friendly, safe, and offers a warm background to what's happening onscreen (I'm talking about the music in the show, not on the game).I've really come to love the Roloff family. I've come to learn much about midgets, the different forms of midgetism, and the struggles they go through just to lead a normal life. This show is great for anyone at any age. But especially great for kids to learn about differences in the world around them, that there are other people out there who might have to struggle a little more just to keep up with the rush of society.",5,I Love The Midget Family,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,1846,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'fascination', 'midgets', 'while', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""'re"", 'funny', 'little', 'buggers', 'running', 'around', 'broken', 'toys', 'swollen', 'heads', 'helium-induced', 'voices', 'So', 'heard', 'show', 'started', 'watching', 'laughing', 'week-after-week', 'Watching', 'Amy', 'create', 'stools', 'climb', 'can', 'reach', 'stuff', 'kitchen', 'Matt', 'burn', 'rubber', 'around', 'scooter', 'Zach', 'running', 'around', 'Civil', 'War', 'hat', 'little', 'crooked', 'legs', 'had', 'tears', 'Now', 'go', 'bashing', 'insensitive', 'know', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'lot', 'show', 'Matt', 'opening', 'monologue', 'people', 'can', 'learn', 'do', 'everything', 'other', 'people', 'do', 'different', 'way', 'typical', 'white', 'family', 'who', 'live', 'farm', 'argue', 'spending', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'raising', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'getting', 'ready', 'leave', 'home', 'Jacob', 'who', 'got', 'few', 'years', 'go', 'who', 'are', 'Matt', 'dad', 'who', 'control', 'freak', 'must', 'be', 'aspect', 'business', 'household', 'monitoring', 'work', 'swings', 'crutches', 'absolutely', 'love', 'when', 'music', 'show', 'lot', 'Simsvideo', 'game', 'especially', 'part', 'where', 'build', 'make', 'additions', 'house', 'very', 'friendly', 'safe', 'warm', 'background', 'what', 'happening', 'onscreen', ""'m"", 'talking', 'music', 'show', 'not', 'game', ""'ve"", 'really', 'come', 'love', 'Roloff', 'family', ""'ve"", 'come', 'learn', 'much', 'midgets', 'different', 'forms', 'midgetism', 'struggles', 'go', 'through', 'just', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'show', 'great', 'anyone', 'age', 'especially', 'great', 'kids', 'learn', 'differences', 'world', 'are', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'struggle', 'little', 'more', 'just', 'keep', 'up', 'rush', 'society']",N/A
