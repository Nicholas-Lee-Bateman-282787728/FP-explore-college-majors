1458965,AD5JI9UN98JPH,B005FLSZQA,christmas lover,"[0, 0]",These are some good episodes of The Chipmunks show. We have one where they put on a Thanksgiving show for their family but not before they get nervous about trying something new. In another one we have an Its a Wonderful Life theme when David gets a chance to see how the Chipmunks lives would've been without him. Another one had sort of  A Christmas Carol theme with one difference. Alvin instead of hating Christmas likes it too much particularly the part about getting gifts missing that Christmas is about giving and is visited by three ghosts. And speaking of Christmas and giving we also have their Christmas movie where Alvin didn't lose the true spirit of Christmas but is accused of it after he gives his harmonica to a sick kid and then must quickly raise money to get another one after David books a Christmas eve concert for Simon Theodore and him at Carnage Hall which includes him doing a harmonica solo. You should get this.

I purchased this item because I received a large amount of enjoyment from watching it with my sister's children over Christmas.  Here is the reason I only gave it four stars.  Throughout several of the episodes on the disc, large amounts of black watermarks appear on the screen.  I know this is because several of the episodes are made from the mid 80s, but the watermarks are very distracting to me when I watch the shows.  I always think something is wrong with my DVD player.  If you love the old, ""Alvin and the Chipmunk"" show, you should definitely purchase this item.  You will receive much enjoyment from watching the Chipmunks old holiday themed episodes.

It states it includes ""A Chipmunk Christmas, Its a Wonderful Life Dave and Alvin's Christmas Carol"".  So, these have already been released on at least 2 previous DVDs.  The Chipmunk's Christmas is a classic special,  So if you don't already have it, it is a great one to get. (Short outline - The Chipmunks are getting ready to prepare for a big concert where they will debut their ""New"" song - Christmas Don't Be Late, and Alvin is too busy since he just HAS to get a golden harmonica.  When Alvin meets a sick little boy, he starts to rethink his priorities.).  Alvin's Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life Dave are both decent episodes,  although the latter is NOT a Christmas episode (despite the episode title). It also includes the Chipmunk Celebration episode. Their relatives are coming out to see them in the community play.  Aside of a pilgrim themed play,  this episode does not actually have much of a Thanksgiving theme.  So if you already have these episodes on DVD - these are just repeats.",3,So..
