In fact, it's nothing short of a masterpiece.It tells the story of Moses, and how he led the Israelites out of Egypt.  However, unlike the Ten Commandments (with Charlton Heston), this animation explores the close relationship between Moses and Rameses.  The footage here is fascinating.The musical score is magnificent, and it mirrors and highs and lows of Moses' life - life in the royal palace in the lap of luxury; his confusion when he discovers his Hebrew origins; his anguish of being the reluctant foe of Rameses, and the awesome finale.  It's all here.  I especially love the film version of ""When You Believe"" - the part when the kids sing in Hebrew is magical.

62625,A2D5IK2Q2P355K,078322995X,Amazon Customer,"[13, 16]","The Prince of Egypt is easily one of my all-time favorite animated features (the other being The Lion King).  It is visually stunning, bringing ancient Egypt to life in a way that no other film even comes close.  However, the main strength of the film is to take an epic tale that defined a nation and make it relevant to viewers from all cultures everywhere.  In less capable hands, Moses might have come across as lifeless as a certain chief of the NRA and about as sympathetic as any number of fire and brimstone prophets found within the pages of the Bible.  But The Prince of Egypt turns him into a flesh and blood person, one who feels agony at having to unleash disease and destruction upon the Egyptians and their children in order to fulfil his duty to his people and his God.  It is the age old dilemma of whether to take action that is necessary yet appears to be morally ambiguous.  It is a theme that is as relevant to Hindus (re: Arjuna agonising before the Battle of Kurukshetra over having to fight and possibly kill his kinsmen in order to fulfil his duty as a warrior and to restore honour to his family in the Mahabharata) as it is to Christians, Hebrews and Muslims.  The amazing score by Hans Zimmer only adds to the already impressive qualities of this film.  The haunting voice of the late Ofra Haza in ""Deliver Us"" made me cry - one can almost feel the pain of the mother forced to abandon her baby to the elements.  ""The Burning Bush"" and ""The Red Sea"" augmented the film's visuals well, making one feel as if one is really in the presence of the Divine.

62628,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,078322995X,Anthony L.,"[2, 2]","The Prince of Egypt is worthy of a lot of praise indeed.Firstly, the film is so visually stunning, wonderfully grand and spectacular, gorgeously drawn, and originally designed that it's impossible not to be impressed. Character designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and Nicolas Marlet worked absolute wonders with designing the people and animals of the movie.Each individual character exhibits the same amount of love, care, and attention to detail that a human actor would in a live-action movie. Note the sharp contrast of the clean, white, angular lines of Egypt compared to the colourful, organic, natural lines of the Hebrews.Note the awesome pyramids, sphinxes, temples and obelisks accurately recreated in all their original glory. Note the 10 Plagues of Egypt vividly brought to life on screen.Note the grand moment when, as the Israelites cross the Red Sea, two huge whales are seen swimming in silhouette in the water. Note the awe-inspiring desert and mountain landscapes beautifully painted before your eyes.Everything about this movie is a visual triumph!Secondly, Prince of Egypt has a stellar voice cast - probably the greatest ever assembled in an animated film. It's a voice cast that directors dream about:Val Kilmer - turning in a surprisingly emotional and fine role as Moses. Kilmer also provides the voice of God. Instead of the booming voice most of us would expect in such a role, Kilmer's God is as quiet as a whisper, and as gentle as the wind.Ralph Fiennes - who's Rameses is unbelievably intense.Michelle Pfeiffer - Zipporah, Moses's wife.Sandra Bullock - Miriam, Moses's sister.Jeff Goldblum - who's Aaron (Moses's older brother) is surprisingly emotionally acted. A standout role in a film of good roles.Danny Glover - as a flamboyant Jethro, Moses's father-in-law.Patrick Stewart and Helen Mirren - wonderfully acting Moses's adoptive parents.And Steve Martin and Martin Short - who play two evil Egyptian priests.On the whole, it's an amazing voice cast who perfectly portray their characters as if they were really acting as them. In particular, I was impressed (after watching Behind the Scenes Footage) how much of himself Ralph Fiennes put into his performance of Rameses.And Val Kilmer? He proves that he's way more than Iceman from Top Gun. His Moses is a role of surprising depth and emotion.And thirdly, Prince of Egypt has an awesome score. I'm not going to even try to describe it, but let it suffice to say that Hans Zimmer (quite possibly the greatest film composer ever) and Stephen Schwartz (Pocahontas, Enchanted) composed it, and that it contains a very beautiful, Oscar-Winning song famously sung by Mariah Carey and the late Whitney Houston - When You Believe.As I said before, I'm not going to even try to describe it, so listen to it here (The Prince Of Egypt: Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), or better yet, watch the movie.No really! - watch Prince of Egypt. It's a visually stunning, very well acted and scored, emotionally rich Dreamworks Triumph.

62630,ANGH6401L9Y0T,078322995X,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","I like this movie a lot. Actually, I like it better than DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"". They are quite different, of course, in spite of telling the story of the same main character, and having as a reference a book that has been around for a very, very long time. But Dreamworks acknowledges it has taken some liberties with the basic story, which DeMille did not. He tried to be as faithful to the Book as possible. Frankly, it's more interesting this way.The story opens with the basket in the bulrushes, much like DeMille's, although Moses' Hebrew mother has a lovely little song (which he later remembers when his sister Miriam sings it), and there's some amusing scenes about the perils the basket encountered before it got to the Pharaoh's wife's hands. (In DeMille's, as I believe in the Book, it is Pharaoh's daughter.) Ramses is a toddler at the time.When we see Moses and Ramses again, they are racing their chariots, wrecking havoc on the construction site they race through. They are acting like brothers, and as far as they know, they are brothers. Ramses is the elder and the one who will become Pharaoh, but Moses is a Prince of Egypt (hence the title).By happenstance, Moses encounters Miriam and Aaron, his real sister and brother, and as mentioned, remembers the song Miriam sings. He goes back to the palace full of conflicts over the possibility that he was born Hebrew: a slave. He has a dream which is very well done, with the illustrations along the walls moving and some very clever animation, where, for example, the pictures of his mother and sister and brother hide from the pictures of soldiers running along the walls by going around onto the pillar in front of the wall. All flat pictures, but they move around the pillar and get away.Moses realizes that Pharaoh, who he has always considered his father, was responsible for killing a lot of Hebrew babies when he was an infant, and that was in fact why his mother had put him in the basket in the river. Pharaoh talks about how ""sacrifices sometimes have to be made,"" but ruins any sympathy Moses might have had for his situation by adding, ""After all, they were only slaves.""Moses runs away into the desert, where he meets up with the Medians, including Sephira, the slave girl (captive) who had been given to him as a gift by Ramses, and which he allowed (indeed helped) to escape. She introduces him to her father, the high priest of the Medians. They adopt him, he marries Sephira, and becomes a shepherd. However, one day when he is chasing a runaway sheep, it goes into a cave and he is confronted with the famous burning bush.You know the story. He goes back to Egypt and insists that Ramses, now the Pharaoh, must let his people go. There's a very amusing scene where the Pharaoh orders the Egyptian priests to show up the snake Moses has conjured, and they do a splashy production number, singing ""You're Playing With the Big Boys Now."" It is well to note that these are the same two priests that Moses and Ramses had doused with water and wine from a balcony when they were teens. The production number is very clever.From here, it's a pretty direct telling of the story in the Book. There's some great music, the animation is terrific, and I especially loved the little kids. The crossing of the Red Sea is awesome, which is as it should be.

The finely honed animation (what a clever way to use hieroglyphics) and the melodramatic musical score add a clamouring resonancy to the finished product, enabling this film to soar openly above most recent animated and non animated releases.Unlike most biblical stories, this film leaves the viewer the option of individual interpretion of the events it depicts, and it is unpreachy in the extreme, rather it relies on potent entertainment value to grip our attention and keep us watching.  A human side to Moses is revealed, from his serenity as a supposed Prince Of Egypt, his exile in the desert, his appointment as a Prophet of God, his conflict with Pharaoh, to his deliverance of the Hebrew people from centuries of slavery.  This is not just a movie for Christians; it is a movie for the world.  By the people and for the people, the story of Moses as portrayed in &quot;The Prince Of Egypt&quot; is a movie and a story relevant to all religions - for it demonstrates that upon the strength that the power of faith, which is the essential ingredient in every religious creed, life altering miracles can indeed be produced, and that those with strong faith can triumph even over impossible adversity.And it lends credence to the familiar quote, &quot;Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.&quot;Yes, with strong belief and faith, miracles CAN be achieved.",5,I do believe!,997747200,"08 14, 2001",2001,1691,"['Having', 'never', 'read', 'bible', 'depth', 'attended', 'Catholic', 'school', '7', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'state', 'certainty', 'how', 'scriputarally', 'accurate', 'movie', 'is.But', 'hard-to-please', 'moviegoer', 'can', 'assert', 'confidently', 'film', 'right', 'note', 'dramatically', 'musically', 'finely', 'honed', 'animation', 'what', 'clever', 'way', 'use', 'hieroglyphics', 'melodramatic', 'musical', 'score', 'add', 'clamouring', 'resonancy', 'finished', 'product', 'enabling', 'film', 'soar', 'openly', 'most', 'recent', 'animated', 'non', 'animated', 'releases.Unlike', 'most', 'biblical', 'stories', 'film', 'viewer', 'option', 'individual', 'interpretion', 'events', 'unpreachy', 'extreme', 'rather', 'potent', 'entertainment', 'value', 'grip', 'attention', 'keep', 'watching', 'human', 'side', 'Moses', 'revealed', 'serenity', 'supposed', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'exile', 'desert', 'appointment', 'Prophet', 'God', 'conflict', 'Pharaoh', 'deliverance', 'Hebrew', 'people', 'centuries', 'slavery', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'Christians', 'movie', 'world', 'people', 'people', 'story', 'Moses', 'portrayed', 'quot', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'quot', 'movie', 'story', 'relevant', 'religions', 'strength', 'power', 'faith', 'essential', 'ingredient', 'religious', 'creed', 'life', 'altering', 'miracles', 'can', 'indeed', 'be', 'produced', 'strong', 'faith', 'can', 'triumph', 'even', 'impossible', 'adversity.And', 'credence', 'familiar', 'quote', 'quot', 'Faith', 'substance', 'things', 'hoped', 'evidence', 'things', 'not', 'seen.', 'quot', 'Yes', 'strong', 'belief', 'faith', 'miracles', 'CAN', 'be', 'achieved']",The Prince of Egypt VHS

That is, it had excellent animation, characters of depth, a moving score, and manages to be very entertaining.As a Biblical or historic interpretation it is a miserable failure.  I cannot  believe those people who say that this is true to the story.  First, the  Pharaoh is wrong.  This is pretty contraversial in the history circle, but  the Pharaoh of the Exodus was NOT Ramses.  Second, Moses probably did not  know the Pharaoh of the Exodus so personally.  But that wouldn't make a  film.  And that minor error is forgivable.  The portrayal of Moses is not.  As soon as the man is called of God, he becomes rather wimpy.  He is filled  with indiscision and regret because of his close relationship with Ramses.  The character of Moses was not nearly strong enough in spirit.  Not to  mention that Moses was 80 years old at the time of the Exodus.Second, the  error of the queen fishing Moses out of the Nile is by no means minor.  The  whole scene was inaccurate.  The historical Moses had no need to  &quot;discover&quot; his roots.  His sister Mariam greeted the Pharaoh's  daughter personally and offered to find a nurse.  When Pharaoh's daughter  agreed, Mariam fetched her mother.  Therefore, Moses was NOT raised in  Pharoah's house; he was raised in his OWN Jewish home, under the covenant  teachings of his OWN parents!  He already knew who he was.  And every day  he saw his people in slavery, it burned him inside.All things considered,  DO see this film.  Don't take it as scripture.  It's not even close.

62642,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,078322995X,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","Before they basically made movies full of jokes without a sense of heart, Dreamworks did Prince of Egypt. Dreamworks was pretty much a new company at the time and had a degree of success with Deep Impact and Antz. But a falling out prompted former Disney head Jeffrey Katzenberg to start the company with one of the big projects being this. While it's a fine film to appreciate and there are times where I was almost stunned by the animation, it does other things wrong and it's hard to figure out where they are but they're in here.Re-telling the story found in Exodus, the story centers on Moses, a young Egyptian prince who's brash and very little compassion for the Hebrew slaves that are working hard to build whatever the Pharoah commands them to. When Moses sees the lack of decency and heart in the Pharoah and Moses' brother Rameses, Moses flees. Years later, an encounter with God gives him the strength and gifts to free the Hebrew slaves, even if it means unleashing plagues upon Egypt.First, I'll mention what doesn't work: the music. I don't know; it's one of those things that should work but either I didn't like the songs themselves or I just simply thought they should've been taken out altogether. I did like the song ""When You Believe"" but the rest I can't remember at all, except for what scenes they were in. However, the score by Hans Zimmer is quite excellent with some really great cues. But in some cases the sound effects (such as the Red Sea stuff) practically drowns out the score sometimes. The voice acting, still following the new-school tradition of having big name stars, is still in place but at least they're quite good in their roles, especially Val Kilmer.But ultimately the star of the film is ultimately the animation. Combining 2D and 3D elements that still manage to be better blended than most films, everything just looks top notch from backgrounds to character animation such as a full-on shot of a woman crying.

The storyline is closer to the actual Biblical account than any other version of the Exodus saga that I've ever seen, though it does take certain literary liberties.  The animation is fantastic with expressions on the characters' faces that is seldom seen in animated movies.  The emotional content is unbelievable as well.  The music score is utterly stellar, beginning the movie  with the song &#34;Deliver Us&#34; as a hint at what is coming musically.  Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks has done it again with an utterly outstanding film.  It's a definite must see for adults as well as for children, but I do recommend that adults watch the film with children under 10 because the violence of the Egyptian taskmasters toward the Hebrew slaves is vividly depicted at times, especially at the beginning, and when the Egyptian taskmaster is beating an old man and Moses, having just learned that he is also Hebrew, takes action and accidentally kills the Egyptian to protect the slave.

62646,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,078322995X,Deborah Earle,"[3, 3]","This 1998 animated smash hit musical about the Biblical Exodus combines all the drama, authenticity of costumes and location, and emotion of the time period from whence mankind was ultimately given the Ten Commandments.The commencement provides a view of an initially arid, serene, and timeless place whose calm is abruptly shattered by the brutality of the ancient Egyptian slave system and the anguished Israelis nearly crushed under its weight.The voice  of the late Israeli folk singer Ofra Haza takes over from the gospel choir's vocal lament of the Hebrew's plight, as the young slave mother Yocheved, who along with her older son and daughter (the latter of whom is voiced by  Eden Riegel) scurry to protect their infant son and brother from legalized infancticide.When so many women were unable to, Yocheved succeeded, placing her infant son in a basket and leaving  him to float on the Nile as her daughter, Miriam struggles to follow it.Through this retelling of the story, a mother's cries over parting with her child at the dawn of time echo through the ages.The journey in this version of the story, is not a smooth one. The basket encounters some realistic hazards of the Nile, including snapping crocodiles, hippopotami, and a fisherman's net before reaching its place of salvation, which ironically, is the royal palace, where the Pharaoh's wife (Helen Mirren) is playing with her toddler princeling at the river's edge. Young Miriam expresses relief at her brother's safety and prays for their eventual reunion and Moses' deliverance of their people from bondage.The Queen's ascenscion of the stairs with the rescued infant in the midst of the slave's continuing toil and agony around the palace is symbolic about the occasional initial subtleness of how Man's prayers may be answered.The Bible leaves us to guess about Moses' life as a prince of Egypt.This film paints a life of carefree recklessness for Moses( Val Kilmer) and his brother, Rameses( a serious and sometimes authoritarian Ralph Fiennes), but suggests Moses' behavior towards the opposite sex was tempered by his adoptive mother as we see in his treatment of the seized Midian girl Tzipporah( Michelle Pfeiffer), who will later have a major impact on his life.While this screenplay takes liberties with the story, it fleshes out a realistic scenario of how Moses may have learned of his true heritage via a chance encounter with his now-grown biological siblings(Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum), and in frustration and rage over their plight, kills a taskmaster in defense of a slave.Fleeing Egypt in devastation, he makes his way to Midian, and en route allows himself to be buried in a sandstorm in a very dramatic scene.True to Biblical form, he saves the daughters of a bison-like Jethro (Danny Glover) from brigands, and is welcomed the Sheik of Midian's tent. Brian Stokes Mitchell's exuberant rendering of "" Through Heaven's Eyes"" comes into play, chronicling Moses's life among the Midianites and marriage to Tzipporah.While searching for a lost sheep, Moses is addressed by God through the burning bush, and is told the time has come to lead Israel out of bondage.A reluctant Moses confronts his one-time brother at the palace with Tzipporah (in actuality, his brother, Aaron)in tow, and the realistic feelings Moses may have had about seeing his brother again are featured in this scene. But Moses stays focused on his mission. When letting his staff turn to a serpent  to demonstrate God's power, he is challenged by magicians Hotep and Huy ( Steve Martin and Martin Short, the film's comic relief), and defeats them. The song ""Playing With the Big Boys Now"" provides an education about  the deities worshipped by the ancient Egyptians.Life for the slaves becomes harder before things improve. But Miriam encourages her brother , and the long-suffering slaves are shielded from the 10 plagues through which the Egyptians will suffer before God's will is done on Israel's behalf. Huy and Hotep come across as a pair of Ancient Egyptian Amway salesmen when explaining the first plague to Pharaoh.Pharaoh forgoes the final opportunity to free the Hebrews before the final plague is sent; its aftermath reveals Moses at his most humane, weeping for a boy to whom he might have been an uncle.Slowly, subtly and benignly, the day of deliverance dawns.The Exodus begins and is summed up in the reverent song, ""There Can Be Miracles When You Believe"" . Fear and anguish subside. Joy and dignity are abound . Children who previously cowered and hid play openly in a soul-stirring moment as the newly liberated travel over the Sinai.An embittered Pharaoh and his army pursue the former captives. But Moses parts the sea,and a pillar of fire bars Pharaoh and his hosts from reaching them. The nighttime sojourn through the parted sea is more dramatic here than in the 1956 version of ""The Ten Commandments"".Pharaoh's continued pursuit of the Israelites is to his own detriment.While Moses' deals with emotional issues  pertaining to the permanent separation from Rameses,  he soon joins the Israelites in rejoicing at their defeat.The vocal talents of Patrick Stewart as Sethi, and the singing talents of Amick Byram (Moses), Sally Dworsky ( Miriam), Donnie McClurkin, Shira Roth, et al complete this superb retelling of the ancient tale. While not completely recommendable for young children, it is a masterful and stirring work of art. A triumph from the crew of Dreamworks!",5,Ashira L' Adonai...There Can be Miracles if You Believe,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,5458,"['1998', 'animated', 'smash', 'hit', 'musical', 'Biblical',

62655,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,078322995X,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 1]","I simply can't stand the CGI-animated films that have become a mainstream phenomenon for this new millennium. Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Shrek, Monsters Inc., and Ice Age were done extraordinarily well, but now CGI is everywhere and I think I'm going insane for even staring at one of their DVD covers! Much of them are just plain horrible (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Barnyard, Hoodwinked, Over the Hedge, Cars, Surf's Up, etc.), but most traditionally-animated films haven't fared well either (Home on the Range, Curious George, etc.). Are we going to have to sit through more of these in the future? I have a feeling that we most certainly will.Fortunately, we still have tons of 2D-animated classics that we can enjoy watching (in both DVD and Blu-Ray). The Lion King, Peter Pan, Fantasia, The Secret of NIMH, Treasure Planet, and many others still look beautiful and modern. These were made with great care, and most of them had solid scripts and memorable characters. One classic that really stands out is The Prince of Egypt. Created by Dreamworks, it tells the well-known story of Moses and his quest from God to free the Hebrews. Almost everything that you have read from the Bible are here: the burning bush, the ten plagues, the parting of the sea, and so forth. What really makes The Prince of Egypt so distinctive is that it's one of the few animated movies that actually takes its audience seriously. It has a slightly darker and much more serious tone, with images that would no doubt frighten little kids. There are still two comedic sidekicks that will certainly entertain the kids, but as a whole, the entire movie is just as mature as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. There hasn't been anything like this since it's been released back in 1998.What I love most about this movie is the animation. The 2D graphics are so beautiful and so detailed, that I literally couldn't help but sit there and stare at the awe-inspiring visuals. The water, the sand, the fires, the Ancient Egyptian architecture, everything is seen as top quality. There is one particular dream scene that's done in hieroglyphic form that looks pretty silly, but everything else is first-rate animation. The songs are very average (some of the weak links to this film). With the exception of the masterful ""When You Believe,"" they aren't very unforgettable. But the orchestral music by Hans Zimmer is quite spectacular. It amazes me every time I hear those North African motifs, and those echoing solos that are done by a soprano.I can't help but admire The Prince of Egypt. It's just as epic as The Lion King. It's a shame that we never get to see animated films like these today; all we get now are 3D-animated films that have flat characters, weak plots, and endless pop culture references. I can only hope that either Disney or Dreamworks (or whoever) can make a film that's provocative as this one.",5,"""Let my people go!""",1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,2890,"['simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'CGI-animated', 'films', 'have', 'become', 'mainstream', 'phenomenon', 'new', 'millennium', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'Shrek', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Ice', 'Age', 'were', 'done', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'now', 'CGI', 'everywhere', 'think', ""'m"", 'going', 'insane', 'even', 'staring', 'one', 'DVD', 'Much', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'horrible', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'Barnyard', 'Hoodwinked', 'Hedge', 'Cars', 'Surf', 'Up', 'etc', 'most', 'traditionally-animated', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'fared', 'well', 'either', 'Home', 'Range', 'Curious', 'George', 'etc.', 'Are', 'going', 'have', 'sit', 'more', 'future', 'have', 'feeling', 'most', 'certainly', 'will.Fortunately', 'still', 'have', 'tons', '2D-animated', 'classics', 'can', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'Lion', 'King', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Fantasia', 'Secret', 'NIMH', 'Treasure', 'Planet', 'many', 'others', 'still', 'look', 'beautiful', 'modern', 'were', 'made', 'great', 'care', 'most', 'had', 'solid', 'scripts', 'memorable', 'characters', 'One', 'classic', 'really', 'out', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'Created', 'Dreamworks', 'well-known', 'story', 'Moses', 'quest', 'God', 'free', 'Hebrews', 'Almost', 'everything', 'have', 'read', 'Bible', 'are', 'here', 'burning', 'bush', 'ten', 'plagues', 'parting', 'sea', 'so', 'forth', 'What', 'really', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'so', 'distinctive', 'one', 'few', 'animated', 'movies', 'actually', 'audience', 'seriously', 'slightly', 'darker', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'images', 'would', 'doubt', 'frighten', 'little', 'kids', 'are', 'still', 'two', 'comedic', 'sidekicks', 'will', 'certainly', 'entertain', 'kids', 'whole', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'mature', 'Batman', 'Mask', 'Phantasm', ""n't"", 'been', 'anything', 'been', 'released', 'back', '1998.What', 'love', 'most', 'movie', 'animation', '2D', 'graphics', 'are', 'so', 'beautiful', 'so', 'detailed', 'literally', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'sit', 'there', 'stare', 'awe-inspiring', 'visuals', 'water', 'sand', 'fires', 'Ancient', 'Egyptian', 'architecture', 'everything', 'seen', 'top', 'quality', 'one', 'particular', 'dream', 'scene', 'done', 'hieroglyphic', 'form', 'pretty', 'silly', 'everything', 'else', 'first-rate', 'animation', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'average', 'weak', 'links', 'film', 'exception', 'masterful', 'When', 'Believe', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'unforgettable', 'orchestral', 'music', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'quite', 'spectacular', 'time', 'hear', 'North', 'African', 'motifs', 'echoing', 'solos', 'are', 'done', 'soprano.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'just', 'as', 'epic', 'Lion', 'King', 'shame', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'animated', 'films', 'today', 'get', 'now', 'are', '3D-animated', 'films', 'have', 'flat', 'characters', 'weak', 'plots', 'endless', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Disney', 'Dreamworks', 'whoever', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'provocative', 'one']",The Prince of Egypt VHS

Beautiful songs by the magnificent Ofra Haza , who was taken from us so young , and Eden RiegelWhere Miriam (read with heartfelt sincerity by Sandra Bullock) tells Moses (Val Kilmer) that he is their brother, while a nervous Aaron (Jeff Goldblum) assures Moses that Miriam is not well and should be excused her impudence.When Moses go's into the Temple where the whole sage unfolds through his eyes about what the Egyptians did to the Hebrew babies and what happened to the infant Moses himself, he confronts Pharaoh Seti ((Patrick Stewart) about the diabolical mass murder of the Israeli babies Seti replies: "" Sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the common good'. The same evil refrain used by tyrants through the ages from Pharaoh Seti to Hadrian, Torquemada, Robespierre, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Castro, the mass murderer Arafat,  Mugabe and every other bloodthirsty tyrannical monster ever.Moses' sojourn with the family of Jethro in Midian, where he marries Tzipporah. The dancing and singing there was incredible. (...).Where G-D appears in the blue translucent light of the burning bush and instructs Moses to lead the Israelites to freedom. : `I have indeed seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and I have heard its outcry because of its taskmasters, for I have known its sufferings. I shall descend to rescue it from the hand of Egypt and bring it from that land to a good land flowing with milk and honey.'Moses confrontation with Pharaoh Rameses and the long struggle to free the People of Israel from Egyptian bondage, his struggle with Pharaoh's magicians (who provide some humor) , and finally the angel of death sparing the Hebrew children and slaying each Egyptian first born son.

62664,AKMXCZXE0KD5H,078322995X,"Golden Girls fan ""Adam""","[2, 2]","For those who give this film only one star, there is obviously something missing from your lives. Today one can't take your child to see a film without those perverted writers and directors having to dirty up the film  with trashy sex and all-out cussing up a storm. This film is one of those  rarities where a child will be entertained as well as taught a poignant  lesson about humanity and faith. For several years now the story of Moses  has been the sole heart of my desire to become a Christian, second of  course to what Jesus did for us on the cross. When I saw Cecil B. De  Mille's grand 1956 blockbuster &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; I was  awestruck by what I saw. Then it just seemed for several years that no  producer wanted to tell a Biblical story from the Bible itself. Mind you  Robert Duvall did an outstanding job with his inspiring film &quot;The  Apostle,&quot; and it just seems that in this day and time of life on earth  films like this need to be made more and more rather than more trash and  garbage. The story is NOT silly. No story from the Bible is silly, and  nothing about GOD is silly. Case closed on that subject. This film made me  cry and restored what made me a firm believer when I first saw &quot;The  Ten Commandments&quot; several years earlier. The animation is among the  best ever in all time, looking so realistic at points you easily forget  that this film is what so many call a cartoon. The ten plagues are  mesmerizingly brilliant and haunting. The awesome parting of the Red Sea  can be seen as one of the greatest achievements in the history of  animation. The water looks and even looks to feel real that you want to  reach for the screen to touch it. The emotional exodus sequence is tearful  and moving, seeing how over 400 years of torment and hardship are finally  cast away in their redemption to go to the promised land. But the one thing  that makes me shed tears over and over is the song &quot;When You  Believe.&quot; When I heard it in the theater during the exodus scene my  eyes spilled over and had to restrain myself from a total breakdown. Every  word of the song is so true and so touching I screamed for sheer joy the  night it won the Oscar for Best Song. I play it each day over and over, as  it keeps me believing when things in life seem dreary and hopeless, so  tempting to just give up and crawl away into a pit of cowardice and  failure. That song obviously defines what those people were feeling over  3000 years ago when they were told that they could leave to go to the land  of milk and honey. It is perfect for anyone and anytime when it seems that  life has dealt you a cruel blow that knocks you out of touch with your  dreams. It picks you up with the renewed strength to keep going no matter  what and that YOU WILL gloriously triumph over whatever has tried to tear  you down. But this film is truly one of the greatest of 1998 and deserves a  place on all movie shelves in every home in the nation, and even the world,  for it is a story for the world to be told of over and over again for all  time.

As stated at the beginning, ""Artistic and historical license has been taken,"" obviously to make the movie suitable for children, and therefore the textual and creative liberties taken are understandable. For example, Moses' cold-blooded murder of the Egyptian who is mercilessly scourging one of his brethren is changed to an accident. This is one of several differences those who have read the Biblical account and or viewed the 1923 or 1956 film versions of The Ten Commandments, both directed by Cecil B. DeMille, will notice. This version is suitable for the little ones, and discussion about the true story found in the Bible after seeing this kid-friendly version is strongly encouraged. The songs in the film are first-rate, the animation is absolutely stunning, the special effects are brilliant, and with the exception of the awful Boyz II Men (who?) song in the latter half of the end credits, I recommend that you cotinue watching the credits to listen to Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey's Academy Award winning song When You Believe.

The beautifully animated has a great story and storytelling, beautiful songs and a great voice cast.

Still the movie has some misplaced humor and 'Disney' like characters, to make this movie appealing for children as well but really this is more a movie for adults than for children. The movie has a serious undertone and some powerful moments, with the burning bush and the splitting of the red sea as the ultimate highlights of the movie.The characters in the movie are well developed, which is perhaps also thanks to the impressive voice cast that consists out of; Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, Martin Short, Ofra Haza. Voices that stood out to me were Val Kilmer, Jeff Goldblum and Patrick Stewart. But it of course is also due to the nicely done character animation and storytelling that the characters work out really well and are highly realistic and humane. The character's movement and interacting is done really good and with eye for detail. The music composed by Hans Zimmer and friends and songs and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz are wonderful. It sounds weird, songs for a serious movie but it works extremely well for the movie and the storytelling and on top of that the songs are all from a very high level of prestige.With this movie DreamWorks shows that they are a worthy competitor for Disney.The movie and its storytelling are really powerful and impressive and help to make this movie an unforgettable watching experience.

(&quot;You're playing with the big boys now&quot; is my favorite song from the film, with its roll call of Egyptian gods!)Highlights include the tomb figures coming alive on the temple wall during Prince Moses' dream sequence. This is delightful, and accurately renders the Egyptians' fondness for storytelling through art.Also commendable is the film's portrayal of the grandeur of ancient Egypt by making everything much bigger than life. This technique adds an almost 3D quality to the imagery, and is highly effective.On the downside, the parting of the Red (Reed) Sea is cool, but not spectacular. It is weakened by the 'aquarium' effect of swimming fish during the sequence.

That does not keep it from being acceptable to older viewers, however. It generates enough interest to be worthwhile to all viewing ages.It tells the story of Moses, born to Hebrew slaves and raised as a prince of Egypt. When he learns of his origins, he flees Egypt only to be called to return. He has been chosen by God to lead his people out of slavery.While this tells the same basic story as the Charlton Heston epic, it focuses on different events and has, of course, a more childish approach. The crossing of the Red Sea is the undoubted climax but other than that, the whole tenor is different. It brings out some parts of the story left out of the classic. Moreover, it emphasizes a friendship between the young Moses and crown prince rather than a rivalry.The songs seem a bit out of place but, for me, they always do in a musical. This once has an Academy Award winner, though, so I guess the music is good if you like your characters to break into song at the drop of a hat.For those interested in the biblical content, its not too bad.

For example, Moses is a young man in this whereas he should haave been 80.  Aaron did not go with him to Pharoah as the Bible tells us; instead they send zipporah with Moses.  The boyhood friendship between Ramses and Moses is completely fabricated - it's not in the Bible at all.  I think it would have been so wonderful if they had stuck to the facts.

I can watch it over and over again, and I don't think I'd ever get tired of it. The animation is superior, the acting is stunning, and the music is powerful.I've seen the story of Moses portrayed in several films, but this version has to be the very best of them all. Moses, as everybody knows, is born into a family of Hebrew slaves in ancient Egypt. The pharaoh fears that the Hebrews will become too numerous and rebel against the Egyptians, and so he sends out his soldiers to slaughter every male infant born to the Hebrews. Moses' mother, Yocheved, takes her young son and flees to the Nile River, where she sends him adrift in a special basket. The basket floats all the way to the royal palace, where the pharaoh's wife finds it. She has compassion on Moses when she sees him, and she takes him in and raises him as her own. She already has one son, Rameses, who becomes Moses' big brother. Years later, Moses and Rameses are all grown up, and getting along like very good friends. Moses is perfectly happy living a life of luxury, but then he learns the terrible truth about his childhood, and soon everything is changed forever.Anyone who is not affected by this movie would have to have a heart of stone. This movie is just so beautiful. And the story it teaches is simply priceless. I recommend this movie to anybody, whether or not they attend Sunday school regularly.

62697,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,078322995X,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[30, 32]","The story of Moses is a compelling one.  ""The Prince of Egypt"" manages to meld that story into a very easily digested tale for the whole family.  Though some liberties are taken, ""Prince"" keeps the basic elements of this wonderful tale intact.  The only truly noteworthy changes are that Moses confronts Pharoah instead of his biological brother, Aaron, doing most of the talking and Moses and Ramses are raised as brothers by the Pharoah.  In the Bible, Moses is raised by Pharoah's daughter, and Aaron plays a larger role in the overall story, doing most of the speaking to Pharoh as a representative of Moses.With those minor details out of the way, ""Prince of Egypt"" is one of the best films around for the entire family to watch.  It begins with the finding of Moses on the Nile River by Pharoah's wife, then shows him grow up as royalty in Egypt.  He and his brother, Ramses, pretty much have full run of the roost.  They get into plenty of trouble with each other, and their chariot race sequence is one of the best ""chase"" scenes in cinematic history.  When Moses finds out that he is Hebrew, and that most of his people are slaves to Pharoah, he begins to notice the horrible things happening to his people.  He accidentally kills one of Pharoah's guards when he attempts to protect one of the slaves, and, upset, he leaves his home in search of himself.  God reveals to him that he is to lead his people out of Egypt, and he must go and tell Pharoah (who, by now, is Ramses) to, ""let my people go.""The tale then takes us through the plagues that wreak havoc on Egypt as long as Pharoah refuses to free the Hebrews.  The final plague, and definitely the most chilling, is the Passover.  This, for those uninformed, is the time when the Angel of Death comes down into Egypt and takes the life of the first born children in every home that is not painted by the blood of a lamb on the door.  This sequence was very moving, and the worst part is when the actual Passover has been completed, and the unbelieving families realize what has happened.  The finale, the epic parting of the Red Sea, is just as, if not more, moving than the same event in ""The Ten Commandments.""  It ties the characters of Moses and Ramses together in a most painful way.  Moses and Ramses share a great love for each other as brothers, but neither can deny their true calling in life.  The final moments showing Ramses on the banks of the Red Sea are very moving, and almost brought me to tears.I've rarely seen an animated feature in which the voice actors have done such a grand job.  Val Kilmer is wonderful as Moses, making you feel the pain and joy in his voice.  Ralph Fiennes portrays Ramses with plenty of regal flare, but there is a constant hint of grief in his voice.  Danny Glover, , Sandra Bullock, Michelle Pfeiffer and Patrick Stewart are amazing in their respective roles of Jethro, Miriam, Tzipporah, and Seti.  Steve Martin and Martin Short are hilariously devious as Pharoah's high priests intent on proving that their gods are much more powerful than Moses' God.  The standout of this group, however, is Jeff Goldblum as Aaron.  In my opinion, his performance in this limited role is one of the best voice acted roles I've ever witnessed.  His character made the film for me, and, other than Ramses, had a strong effect on me as I watched the film unfurl.The animation in this flick is on par with Disney's giant animated flicks of the last couple of decades, namely ""The Lion King.""  The music is wonderful as well.In all, this is simply one of the best animated stories ever.  I place it well above plenty of Disney's top films, and feel that it deserves much more respect than it has ever received.

Overall, it was a wonderful animated movie.The movie opens with Moses' mother and siblings trying to escape from Pharoah's order that all Hebrew boy, of a certain age and below, were to be thrown into the river to drown.  Moses' mother was able to arrive the Nile River, which she placed Moses in a basket and sent him off.  He is discovered by Pharoah's wife.Moses has been raised as the adopted son and prince of Egypt, along with Ramses, the true heir.  They're like any other brothers...challenging each other and getting each other in and out of trouble.However, there came a time when Moses learned of his true heritage and is troubled.  After murdering a guard, while protecting a Hebrew slave, Moses escaped to the desert.  In the desert, he met Zipporah, who later became his wife.Soon after, God appeared to Moses in the form of a burning bush.  Moses is instructed to return to Egypt to free the Hebrews and lead them to the land flowing with milk and honey.  Reluctantly, Moses complied.From here on out, the animation are just wonderful as we seeing Moses confronting Ramses, who is now the Pharoah.  We see the seven plagues that have struck Egypt because Ramses has refused to let Moses' people go.  Eventually, Ramses gave his permission.  However, soon after he gave his permission, he changed his mind and pursued Moses.The scene involving the parting of the Red Sea was just magnificent.  I thought it was just a fabulous idea of showing a shadow of a whale swimming by.

To this part of the movie, I give a perfect 5.(2) The story line for this movie was very disapointing. I was raise on the Jewish Torah and have been told the story of Moses since I was a young child. While the movie was, for the most part, bibically accurate, it did stray in some places. One of these places was that Moses was at least 40 years old, if not older, when he led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Another is the fact that Moses's mother was the daughter of Pharoah, NOT his wife.I strongly disagree with the writers for trying to give this movie a more 'modern' feel. This story has been passed down for thousands of years, it's not something they thought up a few years ago. I believe that this terrible attempt to adapt the story of Moses for the 21st century destroyed what would have otherwise been a delightful movie.

Since I always prefer  animated films to the &quot;real thing&quot;, I felt &quot;finally, a  perfect film...&quot; Being Jewish and seeing this movie during the month  of Pesach(Passover) was literally a religious experience.

Don't get me  wrong, this is a film for all peoples. But it seems to almost be aimed at  the Jewish Community. And I think this movie is better than ANY live action  film to date.

Notice, in particular, the life-like Nile River and Red Sea at the beginning and end of the picture. The chariot race that opens the  movie is thrilling and the parting of the Red Sea is breath taking.  Frankly, I hesitated to see this because I believed that it would just be  ""The Ten Commandments"" re-visited. However, the creators decided to focus  on how the God's edict to ""Let my people go"" would effect the relationship  of the two brothers--Rameses and Moses.  This point of view permits the  audience to have a strong attachment to both characters and the things that  happen to them. Another surprise is that the creators did not tone down or  ""Hollywoodize"" the religious aspects of the story. They realized that the  great power of this story is its spiritual element. The DVD ""extras"" make  it well worth the price. In particular, I found the comparison drawings  showing the creation of the chariot race to be particularly compelling.

It is even comparable at times with Lean's ''Lawrence of Arabia'', as in the scene in which a forlorn Moses wanders through the vast Egyptian wilderness of desert, painted in evocative reds and blacks, across which stinging winds swirl.The story recorded in Exodus of Moses and his liberation of the Jewish people from bondage is certainly not without interest on both a theological and emotional scale: and in ''The Prince of Egypt'', while unusually complex in the psychological realism of it's characters and it's depiction of their emotional struggles by animated film standards, is still perhaps not the most thematically sophisticated of films, the latter is exploited to it's fullest potential, with the possibly imaginary yet still poignant and compelling rivalry between Moses and and his adoptive brother Rameses, as well as Moses childhood abandonment and upbringing in the royal house of the pharaohs, his discovery of his true identity, etc. etc. lending depth to these characters, aside from their usual, somewhat simplistic role as saints/villains.It is true that the film-makers take certain liberties with the elements of the original story, embellishing and enhancing them, though it is not hard to see why: after all, though not devoid of emotion, ''Exodus'' is more of a theological tract than an entertainment. Thus the film-makers, in order to appeal to their key demographic of families and kids (though this is as much a movie for the art-lover and film buff as it is for the five year old, perhaps more so), felt the need to flesh it all out a bit with some drama and (very good) musical numbers. It may sound somewhat questionable to the more religious, but rest assured, it works. It all works, everything from the music, the way in which the element's of the ''plot'' are woven into a resonant whole, and the animation. Especially the animation.Which is where ''Prince'' is king. Returning to the subject of animation, the rich tone and atmosphere of Ancient Egyptian civilization comes alive in this picture as never before, in a manner to rival any motion picture, animated or otherwise, before or since. Remarkably detailed Hieroglyphs depicting the massacre of Jewish babies adorn the chambers of the royal catacombs. As the infant Moses drifts down the nile in his famous basket of reeds, the waters of the river reflect and undulate in an uncannily life-like and convincing manner, as the oars of Egyptian barges pound the waves and little monkeys shriek and dangle by their tales from the branches of trees. Jewish huts in Goshen are covered with piles of ornately thatched leaves. Grandiose monuments erected by hordes of ceaselessly laboring Jewish slaves, their brows drenched with sweat and their backs embedded with the innumerable scars of Egyptian lashes, surround the vista of Rameses I royal domain. This is no exaggeration: the ''Prince of Egypt'' is so detailed one can literally smell the camels and the sun-drenched mud, the incense on the altars of the priests and the ''salt of the sweat'' on the brow of those unfortunate slaves. This movie, endlessly compelling and entertaining, is, in a word, nothing short of fascinating.",3,The ''Prince'' is king,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,3735,"['have', 'always', 'had', 'certain', 'fascination', 'people', 'culture', 'Ancient', 'Egypt', 'suppose', 'animated', 'film', 'biblical', 'story', 'Moses', 'exodus', 'Jews', 'Egypt', 'helped', 'foster', 'interest', 'not', 'surprising', 'however', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'breath-taking', 'thematically', 'powerful', 'animated', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'rare', 'bird', 'cartoon', 'truly', 'work', 'art', 'second', 'only', 'visual', 'splendor', 'Rintaro', 'Metropolis', 'emotional', 'grandeur', 'realism', 'Isao', 'Takahata', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'even', 'comparable', 'times', 'Lean', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'scene', 'forlorn', 'wanders', 'vast', 'Egyptian', 'wilderness', 'desert', 'painted', 'evocative', 'reds', 'blacks', 'stinging', 'winds', 'swirl.The', 'story', 'recorded', 'Exodus', 'Moses', 'liberation', 'Jewish', 'people', 'bondage', 'certainly', 'not', 'interest', 'theological', 'emotional', 'scale', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'unusually', 'complex', 'psychological', 'realism', 'characters', 'depiction', 'emotional', 'struggles', 'animated', 'film', 'standards', 'still', 'perhaps', 'not', 'most', 'thematically', 'sophisticated', 'films', 'latter', 'exploited', 'fullest', 'potential', 'possibly', 'imaginary', 'yet', 'still', 'poignant', 'compelling', 'rivalry', 'Moses', 'adoptive', 'brother', 'Rameses', 'as', 'well', 'Moses', 'childhood', 'abandonment', 'upbringing', 'royal', 'house', 'pharaohs', 'discovery', 'true', 'identity', 'etc', 'etc', 'lending', 'depth', 'characters', 'aside', 'usual', 'somewhat', 'simplistic', 'role', 'saints/villains.It', 'true', 'film-makers', 'take', 'certain', 'liberties', 'elements', 'original', 'story', 'embellishing', 'enhancing', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'not', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'Exodus', 'more', 'theological', 'tract', 'entertainment', 'Thus', 'film-makers', 'order', 'appeal', 'key', 'demographic', 'families', 'kids', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'art-lover', 'film', 'buff', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'felt', 'need', 'flesh', 'out', 'bit', 'drama', 'very', 'good', 'musical', 'numbers', 'may', 'sound', 'somewhat', 'questionable', 'more', 'religious', 'rest', 'assured', 'everything', 'music', 'way', 'element', 'plot', 'are', 'woven', 'resonant', 'whole', 'animation', 'Especially', 'animation.Which', 'where', 'Prince', 'king', 'Returning', 'subject', 'animation', 'rich', 'tone', 'atmosphere', 'Ancient', 'Egyptian', 'civilization', 'alive', 'picture', 'never', 'manner', 'rival', 'motion', 'picture', 'animated', 'otherwise', 'Remarkably', 'detailed', 'Hieroglyphs', 'depicting', 'massacre', 'Jewish', 'babies', 'adorn', 'chambers', 'royal', 'catacombs', 'infant', 'Moses', 'down', 'nile', 'famous', 'basket', 'reeds', 'waters', 'river', 'reflect', 'undulate', 'uncannily', 'life-like', 'convincing', 'manner', 'oars', 'Egyptian', 'barges', 'pound', 'waves', 'little', 'monkeys', 'shriek', 'dangle', 'tales', 'branches', 'trees', 'Jewish', 'huts', 'Goshen', 'are', 'covered', 'piles', 'ornately', 'thatched', 'leaves', 'Grandiose', 'monuments', 'erected', 'hordes', 'ceaselessly', 'laboring', 'Jewish', 'slaves', 'brows', 'drenched', 'sweat', 'backs', 'embedded', 'innumerable', 'scars', 'Egyptian', 'lashes', 'surround', 'vista', 'Rameses', 'royal', 'domain', 'exaggeration', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'so', 'detailed', 'one', 'can', 'literally', 'smell', 'camels', 'sun-drenched', 'mud', 'incense', 'altars', 'priests', 'salt', 'sweat', 'brow', 'unfortunate', 'slaves', 'movie', 'endlessly', 'compelling', 'entertaining', 'word', 'nothing', 'short', 'fascinating']",The Prince of Egypt VHS

62721,AURZ4YQ270W3T,078322995X,Mike Freed,"[6, 6]","In addition to being a beautifully made film, &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; stands as an excellent example of how to make religious subject matter entertaining without being preachy. It's also very much an adult film, and that's OK by me; it's about time us adults had a animated film we didn't have to suffer through.This film bucks the trend of frankly religious films (&quot;The Omega Code,&quot; &quot;Left Behind,&quot; etc.) that are little more than shills for a narrow religious viewpoint; indeed, &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; should be quite an experience for a viewer of ANY faith, even if it interprets the Old Testament a little loosely (which, to the producers' credit, is explained before the opening credits).The main strength of &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; should be evident to anyone who watches the first two minutes of it: the animation is absolutely exquisite, and has marvelous depth. The film stands right up in this respect with any of Disney's best, which is no surprise; the film's producer, Jeffrey Katzenberg, is credited with prodding Disney to make classics like &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Little Mermaid.&quot;&quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; also scores with a nuanced, beautifully layered plot that goes way beyond the typical kiddie-animation level (and makes it an iffy kiddie film - a tradeoff I support), excellent songs from Stephen Schwartz, and some of the strongest voicing I've ever seen in an animated film.One of the great delights of this film is the relationship between Moses (Val Kilmer) and his would-be brother Ramsses (Ralph Fiennes). It would have been easy to make both characters little more than caricatures of good and evil, but instead we get inside their close, loving relationship and see each man's motivations; for Moses, it's guilt over his adopted family's treatment of Jews, while Ramsses acts out of a strong, if misguided, sense of duty to his country. Each man does what he must, even if it means breaking each other's heart, and in the end, that's exactly what happens.That the inevitable climax is played more for tragedy than an easy &quot;I'm right, you're wrong&quot; payoff, in my opinion, evidence of a serious dramatic intelligence and an abiding faith in the intelligence of the viewer. No animated film I've seen even begins to approach this level of nuance and complexity.Of course, it's this complexity that makes &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; a poor entertainment for young kids; it's not overly violent, and has no inappropriate sexual content or language, but without talking animals and cutesy songs, this film simply won't appeal much to the kiddies for more than 10 minutes at a time.Personally, I think some of these themes are a bit too heavy for a child under eight or so (try explaining why God killed Pharoah's little boy to your four-year-old, as I had to, and you'll understand); in the end, it's up to you.Overall, though, &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; is a real treasure of a film, and for those of us who believe in its story, it's a wonderful affirmation of the cornerstone of our faith. That &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; can do that without being preachy or self-righteous makes it that much better a film.Bravo!A word about the DVD features: DreamWorks really did a nice job on the extras for this one. The navigation is exceptionally well done, the picture and sound quality are flawless, and there are plenty of extra features to justify spending more on a DVD.",4,Now THIS is how you handle films about religion!

On the one hand, many of the action scenes are totally awesome, such as the wedding dances around Jethro's campfire, the Burning Bush, the Exodus, the Splitting of the Sea.  And I liked the fact that Jewish music was used in places (even some Hebrew in Miriam's song at the sea.)  On the other hand, the attempt to make the story &quot;relevant&quot; through the use of contemporary language in the dialogue sounded lame to me, and will no doubt sound dated in a few years.  For example, when Pharoah says, &quot;I won't be the weak link,&quot; I almost expected to hear the game show theme.  I also thought that the sibling rivalry idea was overplayed.  There were obvious shades of Ben Hur and Masala here, too, right down to a reckless chariot race.  Ramses comes across as little more than a jerk with an insecurity complex who wants to get even with his brother.  In short, I disliked this film for the same reason that I dislike many recent Disney re-makes of the classics.

The characters lacked emotion in all the wrong places. I would think that if I saw my first born killed, I'd be a bit more upset than Rameses was. Or if water became blood right before my eyes, my jaw would drop at least a little.But my biggest problem with the movie was the soundtrack. Each song was very poorly written. No catchy choruses, no really lively numbers, nothing. One of the best parts of seeing a good animated film is that colors, gravity and the laws of physics are not an obstacle. The artists can create whatever song and put it to whatever setting. The imagination of the songwriters and illustrators definitely fell short.One song in particular, ""You're playing with the big boys now"" was the most dissapointing. The lyrics merely repeated the name of the title over and over again and I found that the animation for the number itself was scary and just disturbing.

62737,A35SK8CQEKTT84,078322995X,"Ray Kay ""The Denominator""","[2, 2]","I saw The Prince of Egypt the year it was released, and rewatched a few days ago to freshen my memory of what happened in that particular telling of the exodus of Jews out of Egypt. I am much older now, and still, this movie impresses me. A lot of theatrical boundaries were broken down for the tale of Moses. I don't know about everyone else, but I end up watching The Ten Commamndments almost every year since my birth. Honestly, I think The Prince of Egypt is far more entertaining. Firstly, making the movie a musical possibly was the best way to go. Every song is thoroughly addictive and have their own distinctive style. They are empowering as well. I felt like crying a bit after hearing the closing song, There Could Be Miracles (or whatever the real name of the song is.) I also caught myself singing Playing With The Big Boys. Now, another the reason I like this movie is that one does not have to be religious to apreciate the cinematic experience The Prince of Egypt is. For people who abide by the bible, this is a wholesome movie. Some scenes may be too disturbing for children (the sores, the death, the other pestilence and plagues.) For me, the real money came when I saw the Red Sea sequence. It was so beautiful, I wished I could've been there. The only reason it gets four stars out of five for me, is that the rest of the story was not told. The worsse parts I mean. When Moses and the freed Jews had to wander in the desert for forty years, never reaching the Promised Land. I suppose the movie was to end on a light note, so they left that out. Perhaps it is better that way.

The disclaimer at the beginning of the movie explains the fact that this is based on the story in Exodus.The main events were portrayed as accurately as I remember them from the Bible story. While many events were added to the story line to make it flow smoothly, they did not detract from the accuracy of the ""parting of the Red Sea"" and the main story of freeing the slaves from a 430 year bondage in the land of Egypt.Through various miracles and plagues, Moses is able to gain the attention of the pharaoh and is sent by God to set his people free. When you realize your place in life, you must follow your destiny. Moses is forced to choose between the life he knows as a prince in Egypt and the life of his people, the Hebrews.Overall, this was a great way to get children interested in reading the real story. I felt this movie made Moses more human and we could sense his internal struggle as he turned against his past and took hold of the future to lead God's chosen people to freedom. The score is hopeful and hauntingly beautiful with a Hebrew flair.For once it actually seemed God was being honored and evil was looked down on. For that alone I say this film is worth owning! The story teaches about pride and how it can destroy you and others. The emphasis was on freedom and the fair treatment of all human beings. That it is wrong to murder another human or to enslave them.The scenes of the Egyptians taking the children from the Hebrews could be very disturbing to young children. That is what gives this movie a PG rating as far as I can tell. There is nothing graphic, but it could upset young children because babies are taken away from their mothers. So be forewarned.The movie ends with Moses receiving The Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai. These were laws given by God as guidelines for daily living. They are still relevant today as they were thousands of years ago. If you want to research this story further, The New Open Bible Study Edition is an excellent choice and you will find the story at the beginning of Exodus. It will also give you more information on why Passover (when death passed over the houses on which the blood of a lamb was spread with a bunch of hyssop) is celebrated today all over the world.""And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.""

Moses is more loved than Ramses, who wants only power and apparently cannot even love, almost evil.  After his vision, Moses becomes otherworldly, losing much of his humanity as a prophet, whereas in the DW version he remains completely human and feeling, even on occasion unsure of himself.

Some differences to note are:1) Seti's wife finding Moses rather than his daughter (Exodus 2:5),2) The idea that Moses didn't know he was Hebrew and had no contact with his family (Exodus 2:7-11),3) Moses' ""accidentally killing the Egyptian rather than deliberately killing him (Exodus 2:12),4) Rameses pleading with Moses to stay in Egypt as opposed to Pharaoh seeking to kill him (Exodus 2:15),5) Any idea of personal rivalry between Pharaoh and Moses,6) Moses speaking by himself before Pharaoh instead of Aaron speaking for him (Exodus 4:14-16),7) An exaggerated role for Zipporah when she is actually hardly mentioned.These changes may seem unnecessary, however they do add intrigue to the narrative and, as before mentioned, do not in any way seriously alter the story.The quality of the music does fall firmly into the realm of opinion.  However, as a person who holds a degree in music, and has performed and taught professionally for many years, my professional and personal opinion is that the music is quite wonderful.  The comments made by another reviewer make me wonder if this person actually watched this movie.  A comment about Steve Martin and Martin Short sounding least like their singing voices is the most absurd because they actually sang their own song.  The singing voices are very closely matched to the point that I didn't know until watching the credits that Danny Glover had not sung his own song.  A comment was also made about the firstborn sequence.  The plague of the firstborn sequence is why this movie gets a PG rating.  Focusing on the children dying rather than everyone involved makes sense, because that's the most shocking aspect of the final plague.  It is also noteworthy that this tragedy is brought upon Egypt because of Pharaoh's stubbornness, not God's lack of compassion.  A comment was also made about the two Egyptian soldiers dropping their staves and joining the Israelites.  I found this to be a subtle nuance that demonstrates the serious research that went into the making of this movie.  Exodus 9:20 makes it clear that there were Egyptians who feared the Hebrew God; and Exodus 12:38 records that many other people besides Hebrews participated in the exodus.  There is no inaccuracy in the movie's depiction.The wonderful music, superb performances by the actors, and breath-taking visual presentation make this a landmark event in animated movies.  It has set a standard that all animated movies since have had to live up to.A final note is in regard to the PG rating.  This movie is rated PG so as to encourage parents to watch this with their children and guide them through the movie's more mature themes.  Please consider this as I highly recommend this movie people of all ages.",5,Rebuttal review for trezku13,1075766400,"02 3, 2004",2004,3468,"['am', 'pleased', 'offer', 'review', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'animated', 'films', 'time', 'review', 'partially', 'response', 'rather', 'malicious', 'one', 'offered', 'reviewer', 'known', 'trezku13', 'felt', 'necessary', 'rebut', 'person', 'inaccurate', 'comments.The', 'movie', 'disclaimer', 'beginning', 'inform', 'viewer', 'are', 'artistic', 'dramatic', 'licenses', 'taken', 'story', 'a.k.a', 'whales', 'Sea', 'Reeds', 'should', 'be', 'prepared', 'when', 'watch', ""'re"", 'watching', 'book', 'Exodus', 'lap', 'will', 'see', 'differences', 'two', 'accounts', 'changes', 'do', ""n't"", 'adulterate', 'message', 'story', 'should', 'not', 'detract', 'viewing', 'experience', 'differences', 'note', 'are:1', 'Seti', 'wife', 'finding', 'rather', 'daughter', 'Exodus', '2:5', ',2', 'idea', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Hebrew', 'had', 'contact', 'family', 'Exodus', '2:7-11', ',3', 'Moses', 'accidentally', 'killing', 'Egyptian', 'rather', 'deliberately', 'killing', 'Exodus', '2:12', ',4', 'pleading', 'Moses', 'stay', 'Egypt', 'opposed', 'Pharaoh', 'seeking', 'kill', 'Exodus', '2:15', ',5', 'Any', 'idea', 'personal', 'rivalry', 'Pharaoh', 'Moses,6', 'speaking', 'Pharaoh', 'instead', 'Aaron', 'speaking', 'Exodus', '4:14-16', ',7', 'exaggerated', 'role', 'Zipporah', 'when', 'actually', 'hardly', 'mentioned.These', 'changes', 'may', 'seem', 'unnecessary', 'however', 'do', 'add', 'intrigue', 'narrative', 'before', 'mentioned', 'do', 'not', 'way', 'seriously', 'story.The', 'quality', 'music', 'fall', 'firmly', 'realm', 'opinion', 'However', 'person', 'who', 'degree', 'music', 'performed', 'taught', 'professionally', 'many', 'years', 'professional', 'personal', 'opinion', 'music', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'comments', 'made', 'reviewer', 'make', 'wonder', 'person', 'actually', 'watched', 'movie', 'comment', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Martin', 'Short', 'sounding', 'least', 'singing', 'voices', 'most', 'absurd', 'actually', 'sang', 'own', 'song', 'singing', 'voices', 'are', 'very', 'closely', 'matched', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'watching', 'credits', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'had', 'not', 'sung', 'own', 'song', 'comment', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'firstborn', 'sequence', 'plague', 'firstborn', 'sequence', 'why', 'movie', 'PG', 'rating', 'Focusing', 'children', 'dying', 'rather', 'everyone', 'involved', 'sense', 'most', 'shocking', 'aspect', 'final', 'plague', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'tragedy', 'brought', 'Egypt', 'Pharaoh', 'stubbornness', 'not', 'God', 'lack', 'compassion', 'comment', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'two', 'Egyptian', 'soldiers', 'dropping', 'staves', 'joining', 'Israelites', 'found', 'be', 'subtle', 'nuance', 'serious', 'research', 'went', 'making', 'movie', '9:20', 'clear', 'were', 'Egyptians', 'who', 'feared', 'Hebrew', 'God', 'Exodus', '12:38', 'records', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'Hebrews', 'participated', 'exodus', 'inaccuracy', 'movie', 'depiction.The', 'wonderful', 'music', 'superb', 'performances', 'actors', 'breath-taking', 'visual', 'presentation', 'make', 'landmark', 'event', 'animated', 'movies', 'set', 'standard', 'animated', 'movies', 'have', 'had', 'live', 'up', 'to.A', 'final', 'note', 'regard', 'PG', 'rating', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'so', 'encourage', 'parents', 'watch', 'children', 'guide', 'movie', 'more', 'mature', 'themes', 'Please', 'consider', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'people', 'ages']",The Prince of Egypt VHS

62745,A1XPB0BO0UYEMX,078322995X,Samtertainment Critics Society,"[3, 4]","Animation took a big step forward on December 18, 1998, when &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; was released in theaters. It is simply the best american animation you'll see. The special effects are great, the story was well-written (though incredibly unaccurate, more on that later...), the music was Oscar worthy.The story - The Prince of Egypt was very inaccurate in some respects, but this was mostly due for the sake of children (though this isn't a kid's movie in the Disney sense). The message of the story, the struggle of Moses to get his people out of Egypt, the grandeur of God (great depiction of God, those were the best scenes)...that's what counts. You can forgive historical inaccuracy in this one, specially since even in the Bible there are some obscure facts about what happened. Basically, the story has Moses surviving the Pharaohs massacre of hebrew male children (the hebrew population was more than twice the egyptian population, this was pharaoh's version of population control, since he feared the hebrew would end up overtaking the empire). Moses ends up on the Palace, the pharaoh's wife (I'm not sure about this, but I think the Bible said it was the daughter, not wife) takes him and raises him as his own. So, Moses never knew he was a hebrew, grew up loving his brother Rameses, who would wind up being his enemy. The story focuses on the love of these two &quot;brothers&quot; (another inaccuracy, but enough of that) and how both end up on different sides due to their respective responsabilities.The music - Zimmer should've won an Oscar for his score. The music is perfect, specially &quot;The Burning Bush&quot;.The DVD - it has great extras. Good &quot;making of&quot; featurette; great &quot;When you believe&quot; video, where you can listen to all the language versions of the movie, the transition from one language to another being perfect; &quot;focus on technical effects&quot;, which is interesting; &quot;chariot race&quot;, a look at how this scenes came up; the two trailers; very good commentary by directors Brenda Chapman, Simon Wells, and Steve Hickner; cast and crew bios; photo stills and sketches; 2000 preview of &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot;, and &quot;Chicken Run&quot;; production notes.

62747,A37DZX4F5RU2PQ,078322995X,Sarita Dutta,"[6, 7]","The Biblical story of Moses has become a spiritual cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide. To adapt it to an animated motion picture presented an epic challenge to Dreamworks founders Steven Spielberg and Jeffery Katzenberg, which they have triumphed over very successfully. Disney's somewhat disappointing Hercules made movie fans look for a different angle of story-telling as it was becoming clear that they were tiring of the tried and true Disney hit formula. .After the Oscar-winning Pocahontas, the studios had not been to deliver its best (though I completely agree that The Hunchback Of Notre dame is one of the most underrated animated classics). Fox's Anastasia conquered a large number of hearts with its amazing character-depth and haunting tunes, but a box-office success of a larger proportion was required to dethrone Disney's monopoly. The Prince Of Egypt is easily the best non-Disney feature ever made (followed closely by Anastasia) and in every way, it as unique a classic as Beauty And The Beast or The Lion King. It is emotional, musical, captivating, and inspirational and has a profound moral meaning and beauty.The story remains mostly true to its Exodus origin. It varies from The Ten Commandments in exploring the relationships between the two brothers who are destined to be enemies. The strength of the movie lies in the strong emotional bonds it depicts between its characters, something which The Ten commandments failed to portray. The animation is lush and vibrant, blending both classic hand-drawn cels and Computer Generated Imagery. The backgrounds and visuals and breath-taking and even the CGI sequences such as ""The Parting of The Red Sea"" are to be marveled at. Dreamworks artists have adapted a new angular style of character sketching which looks refreshingly beautiful on the silver screen.Stephen Swartz's music is melodious and meaningful; from the spine-chilling ""Deliver Us"" to the soul-searching ""When You Believe"" which won the Oscar for the Best Song in 1998. (though I must say that I love Pfeiffer and Dworsky's version much more than Mariah Carrey and Whitney Houston's pop reprise). An astoundingly deep, sensitive and piercing score almost overrides the film's music; strongly highlighting the sentimental points with its rich orchestral appeal and Ofra Haza's tantalizing choral accompaniments. Nominated for an Academy Award, it deserved the Oscar for the Best Musical Score category (though I would personally have loved to see Goldsmith win his second Oscar for his incredible score of Mulan). Warbeck's score for Shakespeare In Love which eventually won, though appealing, pales before Zimmer's work or Goldsmith's masterpiece. Then again, I have noticed that Oscars go more by popularity than by talent. David Newman's nominated score from Anastasia was most definitely the Best among the Musical scores of 1997, although the Oscar favored The Full Monty, which could not possibly win in any other field where it had been nominated (owing to Titanic) and so walked away with a very undeserving award.The Prince Of Egypt utilizes a host of acclaimed on-screen actors and actresses;  comprising the voice talents of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Danny Glover, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum, Sandra Bullock, Patrick Stewart, Martin Short, Helen Mirren and Steve Martin.  It is undoubtedly the most ambitious vocal cast ever assembled for an animated movie. All the actors bring the characters to life with striking warmth and depth.  Both Kilmer's as well as Fiennes' work are very praiseworthy.The DVD offers a excellent anamorphic 1.85:1 video transfer which looks very crisp and colorful. The Dolby digital 5.1 sound makes good use of surround, nicely highlighting the score and special effects. Dreamworks has also recently released a DTS version of the DVD in April, 2003 which is an improvised version of the earlier Dolby release. The special features provide an in-depth look at the making of the movie. Also included are two trailers, ""When You Believe"" multi-language reel, still galleries, interviews with the cast and a ""Basics of the Chariot Race"" CGI explanation segment.The Prince Of Egypt is nothing short of a masterpiece in animation history. The movie is geared more towards the mature audiences and those expecting fast pace fun-oriented stuff will not find it towards their taste. Young children may find some scenes a little disturbing, hence Dreamworks rated the movie a PG. So go enjoy Dreamworks' first animated motion picture, which is a classic to be cherished now and for generations",5,AN ARTISTIC MILESTONE IN THE HISTORY OF ANIMATION!!,1066262400,"10 16,

62748,A1C58YXM2A30CY,078322995X,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[2, 2]","It was interesting picking up an early DreamWorks animated feature and to have it surprise and delight in their take on the story of Moses from the Old Testament.  In 1998 they decided to put together an animated feature that would combine a majority of animators and a minimum of CGI.  The result was quite good.We are all familiar with the story of Moses but the way these creators wrote the tale was different than I'd seen say on The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston.  No, we have two brothers who grow up and love each other.  Moses is the practical joker and Ramses, destined for greatness as the Pharaoh, is teased and can't seem to take a joke.  The story depicted here does make changes from the Bible, as the film itself states at the beginning.  The story as given is a more human approach that I think children and families would better understand.  This is not your daddy's Bible class!In the background are the Hebrew slaves.  When Hebrew children are being slaughtered, or the Hebrews are being squashed down, the usual Egyptian response was ""They're just slaves.""  This nonchalant, superior attitude was throughout the film.Moses' doubt that he would even be chosen as a prophet was interesting.  His anguish that the first born sons of Egypt would be slain and his lament that no matter what, he still considered Ramses his brother was touching.The movie was not heavy-handed in a religious way.  You could see the DreamWorks guys having fun with the parting of the Red Sea, the mysterious force that represented the Angel of Death and the sweeping desert vistas.  Great artwork!Voice actors included Sandra Bullock, Patrick Stewart, Steve Martin, Val Kilmer and Jeff Goldblum among many others.  They did a great job here in vocal expression and tone that was believable and at times dark.The ""Making Of"" feature on the DVD was fun to watch.  The artwork including sketches and production stills was bold and beautiful.  The art direction and discussion of computer techniques which may have been cool in 1998 are pretty much routine in today's CGI world.  However, to listen to them you get excited about the animation yourself.Finally, The Prince of Egypt is a musical.  Lots of songs and music that give an overall theme of redemption and freedom.  Does the bright thread know that it is part of a tapestry?  No, it cannot see the tapestry but should take on its view.  Heavy stuff, man!Music composed by Hans Zimmer and friends and songs and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz really made the movie what it was.  Quite a miracle of animation, a serious story, and if there was a fault, some of the characters were a bit too ""Disney-esque"" but that makes it a family film so it's all good.  Academy Award winner for Best Original Song 1998 ""When You Believe.""Favorite scenes for me were the pillar of fire and the Red Sea split, the chariot race, knocking off the nose of the Sphinx, and moving heiroglyphs on the walls during the ""dream sequence.""

More importantly, it is an inspiring story regardless of your religious background (those worried about seeing a 90 minute propaganda film need not fear,) and is very respectful of the history and cultures it deals with.I was most impressed by how accurately Egypt was portrayed (the middle eastern people in it actually have dark skin!) The film's creators really did their homework in making 19th dynasty Egypt and its surrounding tribes come to life. The use of traditional Jewish tunes in the music is a nice example of this.Finally, this story makes the characters in Exodus very likeable and human. There is great character development and moral dilemmas. There are also no ""cutesy"" sidekicks or silly songs in this movie; the story is treated seriously which I appreciated greatly as well.Besides the absence of cutesyness, the film is quite graphic in its depictions of slavery and death, so very small children might not like it, but I encourage all older children and adults to watch it, it is a wonderful film.",5,A Masterpiece of Animation,1026518400,"07 13, 2002",2002,1153,"['one', 'best', 'made', 'animated', 'movies', 'time', 'First', 'animation', 'amazing', 'alone', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'More', 'importantly', 'inspiring', 'story', 'regardless', 'religious', 'background', 'worried', 'seeing', '90', 'minute', 'propaganda', 'film', 'need', 'not', 'fear', 'very', 'respectful', 'history', 'with.I', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'how', 'accurately', 'Egypt', 'was', 'portrayed', 'middle', 'eastern', 'people', 'actually', 'have', 'dark', 'skin', 'film', 'creators', 'really', 'did', 'homework', 'making', '19th', 'dynasty', 'Egypt', 'surrounding', 'tribes', 'come', 'life', 'use', 'traditional', 'Jewish', 'tunes', 'music', 'nice', 'example', 'this.Finally', 'story', 'characters', 'Exodus', 'very', 'likeable', 'human', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'are', 'also', 'cutesy', 'sidekicks', 'silly', 'songs', 'movie', 'story', 'treated', 'seriously', 'appreciated', 'greatly', 'well.Besides', 'absence', 'cutesyness', 'film', 'quite', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'slavery', 'death', 'so', 'very', 'small', 'children', 'might', 'not', 'encourage', 'older', 'children', 'adults', 'watch', 'wonderful', 'film']",The Prince of Egypt VHS

However, I feel that its handling of ""adoption"" was very poor & a young adopted child could read bad things into the situation & what is indirectly said about adoption.  When Moses realizes he was adopted, he sees his current reality as fake & wants to go back to his true identity of being Hebrew.  Granted...  there's a lot more going on....  obviously Pharoah is the bad guy & Moses was supposed to go lead the Hebrews...  But an adopted child might related to Moses as being adopted & feeling like he was living in a fake reality....  Moses even implies that his brother isn't *really* his brother, although he still considers him to be his brother in spirit...  and then Moses leaves and refers to Pharoah as the man he used to call father (i.e., before he knew better).

Many dues owing to Katzenberg who put Disney back on the map in the early nineties with &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Sumptuously  told and written with jaw dropping animation scenes at regular intervals.  The Biblical story of how Moses freed the Israelites from the Pharoah's  clutches is crisply told remaining faithful to what is a keystone in the  faith of many Christians.

62758,A2S24ARW626ZVU,078322995X,Stella Rosenfeld,"[1, 1]","I am tremendous fan of good-quality animation but a movie is only worthwhile as long as it is accompanied by good-quality storytelling. ""The Prince of Egypt"" tasks some risks in altering the text of the story of Exodus but it manages to deliver both on its big-budgeted epic scale.  No one can replicate Charles Heston's 1956 performance yet I found this film to be a respectable homage to DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"". Plus the kids will learn a thing or two.In the past 10 years we've seen far too many computer-animated slapstick films spurted out like candy bars from a vending machine. Disney took us ""to infinity and beyond"" with Toy Story and ""Antz"" was a good laugh. But honestly, it's sad to see how many companies are cutting corners and neglecting the beauty that traditional animation can capture.""The Prince of Egypt"" does neither. It maximizes the potential of its time by using hand-drawn animation to capture the beauty and details of the Egyptians' tunics and the woven tents of Midian. At the same time computer effects bring an intricate nightmare of hieroglyphics to life. It looks more than neat. It looks damn good. And the other factor is the degree of brutality that this film can push into a PG rating without overdoing it. (They come pretty close, though.) The slaves are beaten and we see the weariness in their sagging eyes. Moses' face shows utter horror when he kills a man. The Egyptians scream with fear when plagues manifest their lives. We're not in Disneyland anymore, kids. (And even the first Disney films were creepy: ""Snow White"", ""Pinnochio"", and even ""Dumbo"" just to name a few.)I was more nitpicky about the character alterations, especially Aaron, who is depicted as the skeptic one. No doubt it is intended to contrast Miriam's rock-like belief in Moses but I found it offensive. At least Dreamworks stayed clear of annoying sidekicks and had two oily scheming magicians-Steve Martin and Martin Short need no introduction-with a few tricks up their sleeves. Ramses' transformation into Pharaoh consumes him with pride until his empire is destroyed. As for Moses, his journey is an extraordinary tale and yet relatable to anyone who embarks on a new challenge be it personal, social, moral, or spiritual.I found the music heart wrenching and unforgettable. Many of the songs are a blend of prayers asking for help and the lyrics only amplify what they are saying, especially when the children sing ""Song of the Sea"" in Hebrew in gratitude as they leave Egypt. The splitting of the sea IS the impression that DeMille would've done if he could've done it in his time. I was overall impressed with this film adaptation of Exodus. The catchphrase ""family film"" doesn't do it justice. It is a work of art in itself and a respectable piece of faith and effort in its time.",5,Timeless Story for a New Audience,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,2813,"['am', 'tremendous', 'fan', 'good-quality', 'animation', 'movie', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'as', 'long', 'accompanied', 'good-quality', 'storytelling', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'risks', 'altering', 'text', 'story', 'Exodus', 'deliver', 'big-budgeted', 'epic', 'scale', 'one', 'can', 'replicate', 'Charles', 'Heston', '1956', 'performance', 'yet', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'respectable', 'homage', 'DeMille', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'kids', 'will', 'learn', 'thing', 'two.In', 'past', '10', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'computer-animated', 'slapstick', 'films', 'spurted', 'out', 'candy', 'bars', 'vending', 'machine', 'Disney', 'took', 'infinity', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Antz', 'was', 'good', 'laugh', 'honestly', 'sad', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'companies', 'are', 'cutting', 'corners', 'neglecting', 'beauty', 'traditional', 'animation', 'can', 'capture', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'potential', 'time', 'using', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'capture', 'beauty', 'details', 'Egyptians', 'tunics', 'woven', 'tents', 'Midian', 'same', 'time', 'computer', 'effects', 'bring', 'intricate', 'nightmare', 'hieroglyphics', 'life', 'more', 'neat', 'damn', 'good', 'other', 'factor', 'degree', 'brutality', 'film', 'can', 'push', 'PG', 'rating', 'overdoing', 'come', 'pretty', 'close', 'though', 'slaves', 'are', 'beaten', 'see', 'weariness', 'sagging', 'eyes', 'Moses', 'face', 'shows', 'utter', 'horror', 'when', 'man', 'Egyptians', 'scream', 'fear', 'when', 'plagues', 'manifest', 'lives', ""'re"", 'not', 'Disneyland', 'anymore', 'kids', 'even', 'first', 'Disney', 'films', 'were', 'creepy', 'Snow', 'White', 'Pinnochio', 'even', 'Dumbo', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'was', 'more', 'nitpicky', 'character', 'alterations', 'especially', 'Aaron', 'who', 'depicted', 'skeptic', 'one', 'doubt', 'intended', 'contrast', 'Miriam', 'rock-like', 'belief', 'Moses', 'found', 'offensive', 'least', 'Dreamworks', 'stayed', 'clear', 'annoying', 'sidekicks', 'had', 'two', 'oily', 'scheming', 'magicians-Steve', 'Martin', 'Martin', 'Short', 'need', 'introduction-with', 'few', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeves', 'Ramses', 'transformation', 'Pharaoh', 'pride', 'empire', 'destroyed', 'Moses', 'journey', 'extraordinary', 'tale', 'yet', 'relatable', 'anyone', 'who', 'new', 'challenge', 'be', 'personal', 'social', 'moral', 'spiritual.I', 'found', 'music', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'unforgettable', 'Many', 'songs', 'are', 'blend', 'prayers', 'asking', 'help', 'lyrics', 'only', 'amplify', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'especially', 'when', 'children', 'sing', 'Song', 'Sea', 'Hebrew', 'gratitude', 'leave', 'Egypt', 'splitting', 'sea', 'impression', 'DeMille', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'time', 'was', 'overall', 'impressed', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Exodus', 'catchphrase', 'family', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'work', 'art', 'respectable', 'piece', 'faith', 'effort', 'time']",The Prince of Egypt VHS

I found it to be a very moving work, both from the story-perspective, with the transformation of Moses from idle prince-ling to committed, mature leader, and for the spiritual and moral values that it celebrates.  They touched the third rail of cinema here, but with such skill and care that it's made something truly extraordinary.The story: the highest priority in the world is not material, but the preservation of Hope and Freedom for all, even when that freedom leads great uncertainty and hardship.  The film recognizes humanity as luminous beings, divinely gifted, with innate value which cannot be corralled or killed or enslaved with impunity.  And that Nature (i.e. the Creation) has a place for us, and is deeper and more beautiful and precious than it appears on the surface.This is fundamental to the Judeo-Christian tradition.  They covered brave territory - the genocide of the Hebrew children, the Plagues, including he last, the death of the First Born Egyptians, surely the saddest and most mature moment in all of animated kid's movies..  But it works because it's a universal story which conveys complex values beautifully.It's curious to note though, that when this was written the Hebrews viewed it as their God's victory over the other Egyptian gods..so they weren't yet Monotheistic.  And of course when they arrived in Canaan their first 30+ years there involved `cleansing' the land of the Canaanites, and later the Hittites and the Philistines etc..  So the world has been `full' since prehistoric times, and freedom always, always involves displacing others.. Modern religion, and by extension the filmmakers, were looking at an ancient text through a very modern perspective.Still, they've made something truly wonderful here.  The soundtrack is witty and deeply moving and powerful, even Operatic in the best sense.  It stands as easily the best film of its type and among the greatest animated films ever made.

It's a nice simple telling of the Moses story which will be loved by older children and adults alike.

Other than that small issue the movie  is virtually faultless the animation is superb and the sound great.  The  movie moves along at a fast pace and although it does cut the story short  it does it with intelligence.

62763,A31ACI0E88ORDE,078322995X,The Great White Father,"[0, 0]","This is easily the best that Dreamworks has ever done, in my experience, and yet it was done in 1998 and who talks about it anymore?  That's a shame because this is excellent.  In fact, other than simply recognizing that you cannot have everything in a film this length, the worst thing about it is Hotep (Steve Martin) and Huy (Martin Short), and they're not in it enough to ruin the movie, at least not for me, not even with their (thankfully forgettable and inessential) song &#34;Playing with the Big Boys Now&#34;.  Other than that, the worst problem is a flaw of omission, not commission, which is that we don't get to see the Passover supper.  But at least the lamb's blood and its purpose haven't been glossed over.While the movie takes a LOT of creative liberties with the exact words of Scripture, I find it is true to the spirit of the faith, being Catholic by faith and Jewish by ethnicity.  Moses loves Rameses like a brother, even when Rameses's choices make him stubborn and hard-hearted, and he sees no love for him in Moses but only hatred and enmity--yet never does Moses treat Rameses like merely a villain.  In fact, if there is any flaw, it's that perhaps Moses is too nice, not rebuking Rameses.  It's one thing to be humble, but Moses is on the side of right here, and would have authority to rebuke Pharaoh in the name of his Creator.  The story isn't 100% true to the facts of Scripture, but I'd say the spirit is there in abundance, and so I can excuse the liberties taken with the letter.  Better still, they manage to take an ancient story and make it timeless--these could be anyone today, even you or me, they just happen to live in ancient Egypt.The songs are excellent too (barring &#34;Playing with the Big Boys Now&#34;), and I especially like &#34;Through Heaven's Eyes&#34; and &#34;The Plagues&#34;--and the Hebrew hymn straight from Scripture that serves as a &#34;bridge&#34; for &#34;When You Believe&#34;.  Also, the cinematography is excellent, and usually I focus more on the characters and story in movies, but the cinematography did an excellent job of telling the story--we could get the story as easily, I think, if we watched this on mute.Also excellent is the depiction of God--I especially like the Hebrew dub, where God says His Name: &#34;EHYEH...ASHER...EHYEH....&#34;  It sounds primeval, like the first sentence ever spoken, even before the universe existed!  Yes...what else could God's Name be?  It's VERY hard to depict God on film and do Him justice without accidentally inviting blasphemy.  I liked how they didn't give Him a big, booming voice.  After all, what does the Creator of the entire universe have to prove to us puny mortals?  Besides, God is Love Itself, and He will condescend to our level, rather than overwhelm us, out of Love (and He knows what we're ready for).Other than what I've said already, the main thing I don't like is the fact that the women are a little too empowered for the time period--that feels anachronistic.  I would have had Tzipporah showing a greater dignity, like the daughter of a high priest, in her introduction, rather than acting like a &#34;desert cobra&#34;--in fact, that seems more like the old stereotype of the &#34;hysterical woman&#34; to me, not that I think anyone meant such.  Likewise, Miriam doesn't strike me as someone who &#34;have been a slave...all my life&#34;--just the opposite, in fact, she's way too quick to take charge.  Aaron, on the other hand--oh wow, how do you cast Jeff Goldblum in an animated movie and have him disappear into the character?!  Especially when Steve Martin and Martin Short don't?!  Props to him and to whoever cast him and animated Aaron!If there needed to be more, perhaps we could have seen more of Moses with his actual people, even though the main story thread was with him and Rameses (also why they ended the film where they did, because that thread was now over).  But again, the one major thing I would have liked to have seen that we don't get to see here is the Passover supper, with the unleavened bread, bitter herbs, and wine.  Still, at least we see the blood of the lamb saving the firstborn from death.  (And the depiction of the Angel of Death was probably the best it could be, especially having no score there at all!)All in all, one of the most underrated movies ever!

Also, after you play one of the special feature segments, instead  of returning to the menu the dvd starts at the beginning and tries to play  the movie, so you have to stop it and go back to the menu yourself.
