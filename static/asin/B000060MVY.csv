691525,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B000060MVY,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","For a Skinemax style romp, I found the movie to be at the head of the class. Its an unabashed Bond spoof. In that regard the male lead, Robert Donovan, does just an amazing job of mimicking Sean Connery's voice. There are numerous throw away one liners that I found to be laugh out loud funny, including Steele's side of a phone conversation with a switchboard run amok. There is a memorable ""sword fight"" scene between 0014 and a body builder henchman which is also an amusing send-up. The rest of the movie is the standard fare for this type of film ... no better and no worse than the rest.What sets this apart is the outstanding performance turned in by Donovan, who looked like he really enjoyed the role, and put a lot into it. Kira Reed has a brief appearance as one of the switchboard operators. This may be an early appearance by Reed. Its hard to tell, because the movie seems to have been repackaged from its origin, so I can't put a hard date on its production year.None of that matters, if you're in the mood for a bit of parody and silliness (along with frequent T&A;), this film fits the bill.",5,Outright hilarious,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,1108,"['Skinemax', 'style', 'romp', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'head', 'class', 'unabashed', 'Bond', 'spoof', 'regard', 'male', 'lead', 'Robert', 'Donovan', 'just', 'amazing', 'job', 'mimicking', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'voice', 'are', 'numerous', 'throw', 'away', 'one', 'liners', 'found', 'be', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'including', 'Steele', 'side', 'phone', 'conversation', 'switchboard', 'run', 'amok', 'memorable', 'sword', 'fight', 'scene', '0014', 'body', 'builder', 'henchman', 'also', 'amusing', 'send-up', 'rest', 'movie', 'standard', 'fare', 'type', 'film', 'better', 'worse', 'rest.What', 'apart', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'turned', 'Donovan', 'who', 'looked', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'role', 'put', 'lot', 'Kira', 'Reed', 'brief', 'appearance', 'one', 'switchboard', 'operators', 'may', 'be', 'early', 'appearance', 'Reed', 'hard', 'tell', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'repackaged', 'origin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'hard', 'date', 'production', 'year.None', 'matters', ""'re"", 'mood', 'bit', 'parody', 'silliness', 'frequent', 'T', 'A', 'film', 'bill']",N/A

To be honest, I was just looking for a cheap soft core movie to watch and this one seemed interesting.But whoaa! I never expected to watch something good and genuinely funny. This actor who plays Rod Steele is absolutely hilarious, specially when he apes Sean Connery's voice, and it's uncanny.The movie is not perfect though. There are some awkward and badly acted moments, but the overall fun that this movie gave me more than made up for it.I've already placed an order for the DVD!May 25 Update...Ok, I finally got my DVD today and I'm both happy, and disappointed. Happy because I can finally have this amusing movie among my DVD collection. Disappointed because unlike what the package says, there is no Mockumentary: ""The Feel Of Steel"" anywhere to be found on this disc, and I've searched high and low. However, there is a short featurette called ""Behind the Behind"", which is quite fun in its own way, showing some *revealing* auditions and behind the scenes footage.My main disappointment however, was the commentary. Yes, even though Amazon doesn't list it here, the disc has a full length commentary from the Director and actors Robert Donovan and Gabriella Hall. But the problem is, they didn't lower the volume of the original audio track so you can hear both the commentary and the original audio track and you can hardly make out what the heck they're talking about. From 4 stars, I bring my rating down to 3.",3,"Rod Steele Rules, but DVD has flaws.",1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,1526,"['bought', 'VHS', 'movie', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'called', 'Balls', 'Thunder', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'just', 'looking', 'cheap', 'soft', 'core', 'movie', 'watch', 'one', 'seemed', 'interesting.But', 'whoaa', 'never', 'expected', 'watch', 'something', 'good', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'actor', 'who', 'Rod', 'Steele', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'specially', 'when', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'voice', 'uncanny.The', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'awkward', 'badly', 'acted', 'moments', 'overall', 'fun', 'movie', 'gave', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'it.I', ""'ve"", 'already', 'placed', 'order', 'DVD', 'May', '25', 'Update', 'Ok', 'finally', 'got', 'DVD', 'today', ""'m"", 'happy', 'disappointed', 'Happy', 'can', 'finally', 'have', 'amusing', 'movie', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Disappointed', 'what', 'package', 'Mockumentary', 'Feel', 'Steel', 'anywhere', 'be', 'found', 'disc', ""'ve"", 'searched', 'high', 'low', 'However', 'short', 'featurette', 'called', 'Behind', 'quite', 'fun', 'own', 'way', 'showing', '*revealing*', 'auditions', 'scenes', 'footage.My', 'main', 'disappointment', 'however', 'was', 'commentary', 'Yes', 'even', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'list', 'here', 'disc', 'full', 'length', 'commentary', 'Director', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Donovan', 'Gabriella', 'Hall', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'lower', 'volume', 'original', 'audio', 'track', 'can', 'hear', 'commentary', 'original', 'audio', 'track', 'can', 'hardly', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'heck', ""'re"", 'talking', '4', 'stars', 'bring', 'rating', 'down', '3']",N/A

All we have now is a cheap pan-and-scan copy with the director's commentary drowned out by the loud audio of the main feature.It ends up like a fuzzy version of some late-night Cinemax thing from the 1980s, borrowing heavily from the spy caper humor of the old 1960s Ted Mark paperback series.Ironically, they also put out an unrated version, but they again went and butchered the picture in half, from widescreen down to standard screen. (Although I haven't heard if the audio on the director's commentary is similarly ruined on this version.)I thought this naughty little gem deserved much better DVD treatment than this, especially since it wouldn't have cost much more to provide it.The movie was originally shot in widescreen, so it could easily be reproduced as such. And it's simple enough to turn down the volume on audio track one, allowing you to hear audio track two. So why didn't they?Sounds like a case for agent Steele himself.",3,Rod Steele DVD suffers from stolen widescreen,1046736000,"03 4, 2003",2003,1057,"['Yes', 'Bob', 'Donovan', 'cool', 'Bond', 'accent', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'proper', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'appear', 'have', 'now', 'cheap', 'pan-and-scan', 'copy', 'director', 'commentary', 'drowned', 'out', 'loud', 'audio', 'main', 'feature.It', 'up', 'fuzzy', 'version', 'late-night', 'Cinemax', 'thing', '1980s', 'borrowing', 'heavily', 'spy', 'caper', 'humor', 'old', '1960s', 'Ted', 'Mark', 'paperback', 'series.Ironically', 'also', 'put', 'out', 'unrated', 'version', 'again', 'went', 'butchered', 'picture', 'half', 'widescreen', 'down', 'standard', 'screen', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'audio', 'director', 'commentary', 'similarly', 'ruined', 'version', 'thought', 'naughty', 'little', 'gem', 'deserved', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'especially', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cost', 'much', 'more', 'provide', 'it.The', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'widescreen', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'reproduced', 'such', 'simple', 'enough', 'turn', 'down', 'volume', 'audio', 'track', 'one', 'allowing', 'hear', 'audio', 'track', 'two', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'case', 'agent', 'Steele']",N/A
