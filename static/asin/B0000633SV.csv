692947,A10WCSGF78M2KE,B0000633SV,Alfonso A.,"[49, 54]","Unlike past documentaries on Tupac Shakur, who's sole purpose is to make money off of Tupac's name, this DVD is an honest look into the exciting life of Mr. Shakur. Right away you can tell that the people involved in this project were the people that REALLY cared and were involved in Tupac's life. Whether it's his first manager, to his friends from Oakland, or Mr. Humpty himself from Digital Underground (The group Tupac broke into the music business with.). Shock G's memories of 'Pac alone is worth the price for this DVD. He takes us to the days when Pac was barely getting into the music biz and when Tupac started getting attention for his solo work. These stories are hilarious, honest, and endearing. This DVD also includes a lot of Tupac interview footage from when he was a young, innocent, 17 year old, to when he was a full blown thug at the still young age of 25. This project doesn't dwell too much on Pac's death, it's more like a celebration on his life. Also, if you're expecting a lot of footage from his Death Row days, then don't look for it here. Although it does show a few moments, this is more like the Tupac circa '91-'95. As a man points out on here, people make it seem as if Tupac was in Death Row for years, when in actuality, he was only in Death Row Records for a mere 9 months. Watching this DVD makes you feel at times that Pac was an annoying, loud, young man. Which he was, don't make a mistake about that, but what the difference with Tupac was, is that, it was an enjoyable type of annoyance. His charm and charisma could win almost anyones heart. Many people always had the bad impression on Tupac letting the media effect their point of views on Pac. But, as Tupac always said, ""Only God Can Judge Me"". It's funny how the show Tupac at age 17 saying that he wouldn't dare call women the ""B"" word, and right after they show him at age 22 saying... His view on women changed from when he was young when he considered women beautiful, and worthy of praise, then in his late early 20's he despied them. Why? Just read or investigate about his rape trial and you'll get the answer. As Shock G pointed out on here, it is absurd to think that any rapper has to go through the trouble of raping a woman when they can get almost any woman they want on command. Shock G's story of what Tupac said to the Judge during his sentecing, will bring ANYBODY to tears, that is, if you have a heart. The message this DVD is giving is that Tupac was a simple black man with great thoughts and ambitons. Quincy Jones once said that if he would have died at age 25 he would have been considered a struggling Jazz player and nothing else. If Malcolm X would have died at age 25 he would have been known as a street hustler. With this, Quincy makes us realize that Tupac Shakur had HUGE potential. Not only as a rapper, but as an activist, and political leader. A look at this DVD takes you into a journey you never knew of Tupac. Whether you enjoy his music or not, this will MAKE you fall in love with Tupac Shakur. And what better way to bring it to us than being told by his personal close friends and himself?As far as extras go on here, there is a unreleased track on the menu, and there are extended interviews of the people that knew him best. Also, they show Tupac's mind blowing library collection that will shock you. And there's also never before seen pictures. This is a must have for ALL Tupac fans. Even people who have never even heard of the name Tupac will enjoy this. A look into the life of Tupac Amaru Shakur.

692953,ABE14SVILZLNY,B0000633SV,"SID ""Punk""","[3, 4]","im not talking about (thug angel) movie butIt's the latest in entertainment news, and if you haven't heard by now, the Los Angeles Times newspaper has announced that they know who killed rapper Tupac Shakur. Los Angeles Times reporter and prize-winning journalist Chuck Phillips, has declared that the late rapper Notorious B.I.G. (killed the year after) is responsible for Tupac's murder. Earlier on the night of his murder (September 7, 1996) Tupac and Suge Knight had attended a Mike Tyson fight at the MGM Grand Hotel and Ceasars Palace. The first part of Phillip's report appeared in the LA Times today (Friday, Sept. 6, 2002), the second is scheduled to run in tomorrow's edition.Phillips claims that Biggie (a.k.a. Christopher Wallace) provided the weapon used to kill Tupac as well as a $1 million bounty. The report also identified the man who pulled the trigger as Orlando Anderson, a former member of L.A.'s Southside Crips gang. Just hours before Tupac's death, Anderson was jumped and beaten by Shakur and his bodyguards (who were also part of the Crips' rival gang, the Mob Piru Bloods). Until now, Anderson was never identified as a suspect in Tupac's murder and was later killed in an unrelated shooting. Chuck Phillips' report is based on his year-long investigation which supposedly included interviews with members of the Southside Crips who had never before spoken out about the killing.Shortly after his beating, the report claims that Anderson and the Crips set up a meeting with the Notorious B.I.G. (who was also in town for the Tyson fight) in the penthouse suite at the MGM. The report further states: ""According to people who were present, the Crips envoy explained that the gang was prepared to kill Shakur but expected to collect $1 million for its efforts. Wallace agreed, on one condition, a witness said. He pulled out a loaded .40-caliber Glock pistol and placed it on the table in front of him. He didn't just want Shakur dead. He wanted the satisfaction of knowing the fatal bullet came from his gun.""Despite the fact that Biggie and Tupac insulted each other in public and in their own music, three days before his own murder, Biggie discussed his turbulent relationship with Tupac on a San Francisco radio station. When asked if he had a role in Tupac's killing, Biggie responded by saying ""he wasn't that powerful yet.""The details within the LA Times report go on and on. The ultimate question now remains: is this report revealing the truth? Or is it as valid as the other rumors (including Tupac faking his death) that have circulated among hip-hop fans? The truth may never be revealed. All that is certain is that the saga of Tupac's (and Biggie's) murder continues.",5,did biggie kill tupac,1031788800,"09 12, 2002",2002,2708,"['im', 'not', 'talking', 'thug', 'angel', 'movie', 'butIt', 'latest', 'entertainment', 'news', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'now', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Times', 'newspaper', 'announced', 'know', 'who', 'killed', 'rapper', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Times', 'reporter', 'prize-winning', 'journalist', 'Chuck', 'Phillips', 'declared', 'late', 'rapper', 'Notorious', 'B.I.G', 'killed', 'year', 'responsible', 'Tupac', 'murder', 'Earlier', 'night', 'murder', 'September', '7', '1996', 'Tupac', 'Suge', 'Knight', 'had', 'attended', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'fight', 'MGM', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Ceasars', 'Palace', 'first', 'part', 'Phillip', 'report', 'appeared', 'LA', 'Times', 'today', 'Friday', 'Sept.', '6', '2002', 'second', 'scheduled', 'run', 'tomorrow', 'edition.Phillips', 'Biggie', 'a.k.a', 'Christopher', 'Wallace', 'provided', 'weapon', 'used', 'kill', 'Tupac', 'as', 'well', '1', 'million', 'bounty', 'report', 'also', 'identified', 'man', 'who', 'pulled', 'trigger', 'Orlando', 'Anderson', 'former', 'member', 'L.A.', 'Southside', 'Crips', 'gang', 'Just', 'hours', 'Tupac', 'death', 'Anderson', 'was', 'jumped', 'beaten', 'Shakur', 'bodyguards', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'part', 'Crips', 'rival', 'gang', 'Mob', 'Piru', 'Bloods', 'now', 'Anderson', 'was', 'never', 'identified', 'suspect', 'Tupac', 'murder', 'was', 'later', 'killed', 'unrelated', 'shooting', 'Chuck', 'Phillips', 'report', 'based', 'year-long', 'investigation', 'supposedly', 'included', 'interviews', 'members', 'Southside', 'Crips', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'spoken', 'out', 'killing.Shortly', 'beating', 'report', 'Anderson', 'Crips', 'set', 'up', 'meeting', 'Notorious', 'B.I.G', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'town', 'Tyson', 'fight', 'penthouse', 'suite', 'MGM', 'report', 'further', 'states', 'According', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'present', 'Crips', 'envoy', 'explained', 'gang', 'was', 'prepared', 'kill', 'Shakur', 'expected', 'collect', '1', 'million', 'efforts', 'Wallace', 'agreed', 'one', 'condition', 'witness', 'said', 'pulled', 'out', 'loaded', '.40-caliber', 'Glock', 'pistol', 'placed', 'table', 'front', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'want', 'Shakur', 'dead', 'wanted', 'satisfaction', 'knowing', 'fatal', 'bullet', 'came', 'gun', 'fact', 'Biggie', 'Tupac', 'insulted', 'other', 'public', 'own', 'music', 'three', 'days', 'own', 'murder', 'Biggie', 'discussed', 'turbulent', 'relationship', 'Tupac', 'San', 'Francisco', 'radio', 'station', 'When', 'asked', 'had', 'role', 'Tupac', 'killing', 'Biggie', 'responded', 'saying', 'was', ""n't"", 'powerful', 'yet', 'details', 'LA', 'Times', 'report', 'go', 'ultimate', 'question', 'now', 'report', 'revealing', 'truth', 'as', 'valid', 'other', 'rumors', 'including', 'Tupac', 'faking', 'death', 'have', 'circulated', 'hip-hop', 'fans', 'truth', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'revealed', 'certain', 'saga', 'Tupac', 'Biggie', 'murder']",Tupac Shakur: Thug Angel
