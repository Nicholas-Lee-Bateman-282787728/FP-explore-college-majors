He's an entertaining guy with a touch of Vincent Price to him who describes and demonstrates the special methods and techniques designed to tap into the Ancient Western Wisdom and summon spirits, gods and goddesses from the Other Side.  Basically, a day at the Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.There's a lot of paraphernalia involved, and costumes, incantations and ritual.  Like most religions, to an outsider it can look like so much mumbo-jumbo.  The repeated ""Don't try this at home"" warnings are a nice touch.

I'm not big on ""Magick"" but my sister is wholeheartedly into it and I support her.  When she mentioned The Magick of Solomon I figured it couldn't hurt to watch it. In this film you learn about:How the Forgotten Secrets of Magick were Re-discovered.The Truth about Angels and Demons.See Temple Operations Performed by magical Adepts.The Modern Classic digitally re-mastered, enhanced and extended with added footage of O.T.A. Magical Operations.It also shows Interactive Hypnotic SequencesObviously, this DVD isn't recommended for children.What I found most intriguing about the film is that they actually show the magick rituals!  I found them to be highly spiritual and actually quite interesting.  This DVD really changed my point of view on magick because I, like most people, had only heard rumors about ""what goes on behind closed doors"" and we all know that rumors are usually blown way out of proportion.  The people practicing the rituals truly believe in what they're doing, and I liked all the pomp and pageantry.  There are lavish costumes and many items used in their rituals, but there's not an ounce of egotism involved.  I was glad I watched The Magick of Solomon.",4,A Look Behind Closed Doors of Magick,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,1201,"['was', 'fun', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'Magick', 'sister', 'wholeheartedly', 'support', 'When', 'mentioned', 'Magick', 'Solomon', 'figured', 'could', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'watch', 'film', 'learn', 'How', 'Forgotten', 'Secrets', 'Magick', 'were', 'Re-discovered.The', 'Truth', 'Angels', 'Demons.See', 'Temple', 'Operations', 'Performed', 'magical', 'Adepts.The', 'Modern', 'Classic', 'digitally', 're-mastered', 'enhanced', 'extended', 'added', 'footage', 'O.T.A', 'Magical', 'Operations.It', 'also', 'Interactive', 'Hypnotic', 'SequencesObviously', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'recommended', 'children.What', 'found', 'most', 'intriguing', 'film', 'actually', 'show', 'magick', 'rituals', 'found', 'be', 'highly', 'spiritual', 'actually', 'quite', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'really', 'changed', 'point', 'view', 'magick', 'most', 'people', 'had', 'only', 'heard', 'rumors', 'what', 'closed', 'doors', 'know', 'rumors', 'are', 'usually', 'blown', 'way', 'proportion', 'people', 'practicing', 'rituals', 'truly', 'believe', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'liked', 'pomp', 'pageantry', 'are', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'many', 'items', 'used', 'rituals', 'not', 'ounce', 'egotism', 'involved', 'was', 'glad', 'watched', 'Magick', 'Solomon']",N/A
1316191,A3MRRLORPCUQS1,B0030Y12DW,"Robert A. Castillo ""roaucasa""","[1, 14]","The movie is more like an infomercial rather than a historic account of what Solomon's magic was. In books related to the Old Testament it's said that at one point Solomon, with all his wisdom, became the master of demons who inhibited caves under The Temple. I guess he entertained himself with them ordering them to perform all kinds of activities.These same demons are the ones who gave unlimited powers to nine French knights in the X Century during a meeting in a cave under the Mosque of the Mount. The descendants of these kights became the Templar who amassed an immense fortune and controlled the world from the XI to the XIII Centuries until they were persecuted, and almost exterminated, by the King of France and the contemporary Pope.The king and the Pope killed most of the Templar and confiscated all their property incorporating it to the French Crown. Some of the Templar manage to escape to Scotland and create the Scottish Rite, and to Germany to form the Illuminati and the Free and Hermetic Masons only to come back to France in the IXX Century and exterminate the whole Monarchy as revenche for the murder of Jaques De Molay back in the XIII Century; The Templar's revenge was under the guise of the French Revolution. Megalomania is an incurable addiction and the Templar, now the Secret Societies, had been infected with it, and thus continue to organize and finance the Mexican and Bolshevick Revolutions; we know the rest of it up to the present day.Following Solomon demons we find them again in Shakespeare's Dream of a Mid Summer Night, which in reality was written by Sir Francis Bacon and not William Shakespeare. Bacon was an esoteric member of some order, and so were all the discovering navigators who used the esoteric knowledge, granted by Solomon demons, to discover America; all of their caravels had the Templar crosses imprinted on their sails. A good example of this is Vasco Nunez de Balboa who discovered the Pacific Ocean, he went accross Panama where the Canal is. How did he know that was the narrowest stretch in the whole continent; he could've gone from NY to Seatle or Brazil to Chile but those crossings would've taken decades and not months; how did he know?All this is never mentioned in the movie, a better title would have been: ""See If You Can Become a Magician"". By watching it the viewer will never become close to control the world.Some say that Solomon fell off of grace as he celebrated orgies in the Temple of the Lord with the help of the demons, after his dead, as we know many of his sons and descendants also subscribed to this behavior infurating the Lord to the point that he had Nebuchadnezzer come to Jerusalem to totally destroy God's dwelling, an addition to deport the Jews to Babylon.To follow Solomon's Magic, the explorer would be better off consulting the in line encyclopedias or visit a public library.",2,Not Solomon at all.,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,2881,"['movie', 'more', 'infomercial', 'rather', 'historic', 'account', 'what', 'Solomon', 'magic', 'was', 'books', 'related', 'Old', 'Testament', 'said', 'one', 'point', 'Solomon', 'wisdom', 'became', 'master', 'demons', 'who', 'inhibited', 'caves', 'Temple', 'guess', 'entertained', 'ordering', 'perform', 'kinds', 'activities.These', 'same', 'demons', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'gave', 'unlimited', 'powers', 'nine', 'French', 'knights', 'X', 'Century', 'meeting', 'cave', 'Mosque', 'Mount', 'descendants', 'kights', 'became', 'Templar', 'who', 'amassed', 'immense', 'fortune', 'controlled', 'world', 'XI', 'XIII', 'Centuries', 'were', 'persecuted', 'almost', 'exterminated', 'King', 'France', 'contemporary', 'Pope.The', 'king', 'Pope', 'killed', 'most', 'Templar', 'confiscated', 'property', 'incorporating', 'French', 'Crown', 'Templar', 'manage', 'escape', 'Scotland', 'create', 'Scottish', 'Rite', 'Germany', 'form', 'Illuminati', 'Free', 'Hermetic', 'Masons', 'only', 'come', 'back', 'France', 'IXX', 'Century', 'exterminate', 'whole', 'Monarchy', 'revenche', 'murder', 'Jaques', 'De', 'Molay', 'back', 'XIII', 'Century', 'Templar', 'revenge', 'was', 'guise', 'French', 'Revolution', 'Megalomania', 'incurable', 'addiction', 'Templar', 'now', 'Secret', 'Societies', 'had', 'been', 'infected', 'thus', 'continue', 'organize', 'finance', 'Mexican', 'Bolshevick', 'Revolutions', 'know', 'rest', 'present', 'day.Following', 'Solomon', 'find', 'again', 'Shakespeare', 'Dream', 'Mid', 'Summer', 'Night', 'reality', 'was', 'written', 'Sir', 'Francis', 'Bacon', 'not', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'Bacon', 'was', 'esoteric', 'member', 'order', 'so', 'were', 'discovering', 'navigators', 'who', 'used', 'esoteric', 'knowledge', 'granted', 'Solomon', 'demons', 'discover', 'America', 'caravels', 'had', 'Templar', 'crosses', 'imprinted', 'sails', 'good', 'example', 'Vasco', 'Nunez', 'de', 'Balboa', 'who', 'discovered', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'went', 'Panama', 'where', 'Canal', 'How', 'did', 'know', 'was', 'narrowest', 'stretch', 'whole', 'continent', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'NY', 'Seatle', 'Brazil', 'Chile', 'crossings', 'would', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'decades', 'not', 'months', 'how', 'did', 'know', 'never', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'better', 'title', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'See', 'Can', 'Become', 'Magician', 'watching', 'viewer', 'will', 'never', 'become', 'close', 'control', 'world.Some', 'say', 'Solomon', 'fell', 'grace', 'celebrated', 'orgies', 'Temple', 'Lord', 'help', 'demons', 'dead', 'know', 'many', 'sons', 'descendants', 'also', 'subscribed', 'behavior', 'infurating', 'Lord', 'point', 'had', 'Nebuchadnezzer', 'come', 'Jerusalem', 'totally', 'destroy', 'God', 'dwelling', 'addition', 'deport', 'Jews', 'Babylon.To', 'follow', 'Solomon', 'Magic', 'explorer', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'consulting', 'line', 'encyclopedias', 'visit', 'public', 'library']",N/A
