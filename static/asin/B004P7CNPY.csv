1423393,A1ZEKEE140M6JO,B004P7CNPY,"S. Souza ""horror fan""","[5, 9]",For anyone who has never seen these movies I'll say that they are very entertaining but not believable to anyone with a cursory knowledge of the Christian religion. However; that being said; these movies are primarily about heavenly angels out to obtain this dark soul so that they can rid the world of mankind so that they can be the only ones in the universe for God to care about again. Christopher Walken is an archangel named Gabriel and it is his quest to find the dark soul. He is very colorful and amusing and Viggo Mortensen even has a small role as Lucifer which is a different kind of role for him. Vincent Spano is also in the third installment and is at odds with Walken's character. I believe anyone who likes stuff like Constantine should give this set a try. Very unusual.,4,The Rise and Fall of Angels!,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,788,"['anyone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'say', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'not', 'believable', 'anyone', 'cursory', 'knowledge', 'Christian', 'religion', 'However', 'being', 'said', 'movies', 'are', 'primarily', 'heavenly', 'out', 'obtain', 'dark', 'soul', 'can', 'rid', 'world', 'mankind', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'ones', 'universe', 'God', 'care', 'about', 'again', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'archangel', 'named', 'Gabriel', 'quest', 'find', 'dark', 'soul', 'very', 'colorful', 'amusing', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'even', 'small', 'role', 'Lucifer', 'different', 'kind', 'role', 'Vincent', 'Spano', 'also', 'third', 'installment', 'odds', 'Walken', 'character', 'believe', 'anyone', 'who', 'stuff', 'Constantine', 'should', 'give', 'set', 'try', 'Very', 'unusual']",N/A
