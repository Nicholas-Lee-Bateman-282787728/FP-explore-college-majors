909627,A5BX6WP8XMC59,B0009OL92K,"Bibliophile One ""Alicia""","[1, 1]","First, let me say that if there were no novel to compare this movie to, I might give it three stars.  As an adaption of this novel, I would give it one star -- thus, I gave it two stars here. The acting is fine, and the movie succeeds as a Gothic horror tale.  However, the writers are greatly to be blamed.  This very loose adaption is a complete travesty of the original plot, which it resembles only in major details and characters' names.  While the masterpiece theater introduction bemoans the fact that Collins' lengthy novel had to be compressed into two hours, it seems odd that the writer spent at least one hour of that time significantly departing from and altering the plot.  I don't object to some simplification, but drastic alteration for no good reason is unacceptable. While I admire the actors, they were not properly cast to fit Collins' descriptions of the characters.  Most disappointing was the thin, flat version of Marian Halcombe offered by this script.  As written in the novel, she is one of the most intriguing and resourceful heroines ever.  As portrayed in the movie, she is loyal and brave but easily warped by a quest for revenge. Although she does not even appear in the novel in the famous fire scene in which Sir Glyde dies, in this film, she turns the key on him and locks him in the church to get revenge (changing her mind at the very last moment, and unlocking the door when it is too late).  In sharp contrast, the novel makes it clear that Glyde alone is responsible for his death, and Hartright's decency shines through as he risks his life to attempt a rescue. Character development for Walter Hartright is woefully insufficient throughout.  In this film version, Marian, not Hartright, is the narrator.  The film version also has an added very dark undercurrent of sexual abuse with the added revelation that Glyde was molesting Anne Catherick since she was twelve. Nor does the novel's true revelation (that Glyde was an illegitimate son and no true heir) ever appear in the film.  Numerous other changes, large and small, also occur throughout the film. Bottom line: if you like period drama and Gothic tales and are unfamiliar with the novel itself, you might enjoy the film.  If you love the novel and care about authenticity at all, don't waste your time.  You will be grossly disappointed.  This wonderful novel deserves a decently faithful movie or mini-series.

909628,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0009OL92K,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","This is *nothing* like the original Wilkie Collins novel, but it still presents the tale in a highly-entertaining way with at least a few of the mind-bending twists and turns from the book.  Filmed in 1997, this version of THE WOMAN IN WHITE stars Tara Fitzgerald and Justine Waddell as the Fairlie half-sisters, with Andrew Lincoln as Walter, James Wilby as Glyde and Simon Callow as Fosco.On the eve that he is due to report for work as drawing-master to the Fairlie sisters of Limmeridge House, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln) encounters a mysterious woman (Susan Vidler), dressed entirely in white, who utters little that makes sense before disappearing back into the night.  The following morning, Walter discusses his brush with the mystery girl with Marian Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald), but it's Marian's half-sister Laura (Justine Waddell) who stuns Walter the most - for she eerily resembles the mystery girl.Any possible romance between Walter and Laura is quickly quashed when Marian explains Laura's long-standing engagement to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), and when Walter is later dismissed from the Fairlies' employ after having made lewd suggestions to one of the maids, the way looks clear for Glyde and Laura's wedding.  But after the honeymoon, Marian notices great changes in her beloved sister, who is now extremely quiet and reclusive.  Glyde explains to concerned Marian that she is simply tired from their travels, but the truth - disturbing as it may be - becomes all too clear.  A plot to assume control of Laura's considerable fortune is well under-way, with Glyde and his friend Count Fosco (Simon Callow) furtively planning an elaborate scheme to murder fragile Laura and inherit the Fairlie estate...This WOMAN IN WHITE deviates from the original book in quite a few areas (most have been covered in earlier reviews) but a few important changes I must include here.  In the novel, Marian has her own surname (Halcombe) which further illustrates her position within the Fairlie household's strata.  Walter doesn't leave in disgrace, instead he departs Limmeridge of his own free will after realising that his love for Laura won't survive her engagement to Glyde.  Screenwriter David Pirie had the unenviable job of condensing and streamlining the Collins novel into a workable 2-hour film, when the source has proven to work much better as a longer miniseries (the BBC's 1982 miniseries with Jenny Seagrove and Diana Quick is, despite a few weaknesses, the superior version of the two).Ian Richardson previously played Mr Fairlie in the 1982 miniseries, but his performance is much better in this '97 version (in the earlier one he developed an annoyingly grating sing-song voice which made Fairlie even more bizarre than what he was written to be).  Simon Callow's Fosco is truly enigmatic (sadly Pirie doesn't really give Fosco much of a proper-send off; another casualty of trying to streamline the rambling original narrative).At the centre of this WOMAN IN WHITE are the twin performances of Tara Fitzgerald (""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"") and Justine Waddell (""Wives and Daughters"") and both are exquisite.  Fitzgerald especially strikes me as very close in appearance to what Collins envisioned Marian to be; and Ms Waddell is appropriately-delicate in bearing and manner as Laura.This is Wilkie Collins-Lite but for a work as tricky and complicated as THE WOMAN IN WHITE certainly is, it's still a fine tribute to this early, masterful mystery author.",4,nothing like the original novel but still a highly-entertaining version of the Wilkie Collins classic,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,3491,"['*nothing*', 'original', 'Wilkie', 'Collins', 'novel', 'still', 'tale', 'highly-entertaining', 'way', 'least', 'few', 'mind-bending', 'twists', 'turns', 'book', 'Filmed', '1997', 'version', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'WHITE', 'stars', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'Justine', 'Waddell', 'Fairlie', 'half-sisters', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'Walter', 'James', 'Wilby', 'Glyde', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Fosco.On', 'eve', 'due', 'report', 'work', 'drawing-master', 'Fairlie', 'sisters', 'Limmeridge', 'House', 'Walter', 'Hartright', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'Susan', 'Vidler', 'dressed', 'entirely', 'white', 'who', 'little', 'sense', 'disappearing', 'back', 'night', 'following', 'morning', 'Walter', 'brush', 'mystery', 'girl', 'Marian', 'Fairlie', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'Marian', 'half-sister', 'Laura', 'Justine', 'Waddell', 'who', 'stuns', 'Walter', 'most', 'eerily', 'mystery', 'girl.Any', 'possible', 'romance', 'Walter', 'Laura', 'quickly', 'quashed', 'when', 'Marian', 'Laura', 'long-standing', 'engagement', 'Sir', 'Percival', 'Glyde', 'James', 'Wilby', 'when', 'Walter', 'later', 'dismissed', 'Fairlies', 'employ', 'having', 'made', 'lewd', 'suggestions', 'one', 'maids', 'way', 'clear', 'Glyde', 'Laura', 'wedding', 'honeymoon', 'Marian', 'notices', 'great', 'changes', 'beloved', 'sister', 'who', 'now', 'extremely', 'quiet', 'reclusive', 'Glyde', 'concerned', 'Marian', 'simply', 'tired', 'travels', 'truth', 'disturbing', 'may', 'be', 'becomes', 'too', 'clear', 'plot', 'assume', 'control', 'Laura', 'considerable', 'fortune', 'well', 'under-way', 'Glyde', 'friend', 'Count', 'Fosco', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'furtively', 'planning', 'elaborate', 'scheme', 'murder', 'fragile', 'Laura', 'inherit', 'Fairlie', 'estate', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'WHITE', 'deviates', 'original', 'book', 'quite', 'few', 'areas', 'most', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'few', 'important', 'changes', 'must', 'include', 'here', 'novel', 'Marian', 'own', 'surname', 'Halcombe', 'further', 'position', 'Fairlie', 'household', 'strata', 'Walter', ""n't"", 'leave', 'disgrace', 'instead', 'Limmeridge', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'realising', 'love', 'Laura', 'wo', ""n't"", 'survive', 'engagement', 'Glyde', 'Screenwriter', 'David', 'Pirie', 'had', 'unenviable', 'job', 'condensing', 'streamlining', 'Collins', 'novel', 'workable', '2-hour', 'film', 'when', 'source', 'proven', 'work', 'much', 'better', 'longer', 'miniseries', 'BBC', '1982', 'miniseries', 'Jenny', 'Seagrove', 'Diana', 'Quick', 'few', 'weaknesses', 'superior', 'version', 'two', '.Ian', 'Richardson', 'previously', 'played', 'Mr', 'Fairlie', '1982', 'miniseries', 'performance', 'much', 'better', ""'97"", 'version', 'earlier', 'one', 'developed', 'annoyingly', 'grating', 'sing-song', 'voice', 'made', 'Fairlie', 'even', 'more', 'bizarre', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'be', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Fosco', 'truly', 'enigmatic', 'sadly', 'Pirie', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'Fosco', 'much', 'proper-send', 'off', 'casualty', 'trying', 'streamline', 'rambling', 'original', 'narrative', '.At', 'centre', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'WHITE', 'are', 'twin', 'performances', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'Tenant', 'Wildfell', 'Hall', 'Justine', 'Waddell', 'Wives', 'Daughters', 'are', 'exquisite', 'Fitzgerald', 'especially', 'very', 'close', 'appearance', 'what', 'Collins', 'envisioned', 'Marian', 'be', 'Ms', 'Waddell', 'appropriately-delicate', 'bearing', 'manner', 'Laura.This', 'Wilkie', 'Collins-Lite', 'work', 'tricky', 'complicated', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'WHITE', 'certainly', 'still', 'fine', 'tribute', 'early', 'masterful', 'mystery', 'author']",N/A

DeRiemer,"[9, 11]","""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery. It's a good idea to pay close attention, because there are plots within plots, yet they all center on a cunning and ruthless scheme which involves, what else, money, lots of money.Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister, Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell) are devoted to each other. Marion is fierce and protective; Laura is softer and much more romantic. Marion has no money of her own; Laura will inherit riches when she comes of age. Marion has no marriage prospects that we know of; Laura has been pledged sometime ago to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), an altogether too charming aristocrat. They are the wards of their uncle, a fussy, condescending, immensely self-centered hypochondriac (Ian Richardson). All seems to be quite routine, but then a young artist, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln), is engaged to teach them drawing and artistic appreciation. And when he arrives at night to the local train station, there is no carriage, so off he sets out on foot to the estate. In the dark woods he encounters a strange woman, dressed all in white, wandering about and speaking of things he does not understand, who then disappears. Are we uneasy? Yes, and so is he and the sisters when they come to realize the strange woman looks much like Laura. Later, does love emerge between Walter and Laura? Does a bud bloom? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and results in Laura marrying Sir Percival? Does a canker gnaw? And do secrets slowly come to light about the relationships among Laura, Marian and the woman in white...do we learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival's intentions...do we come to enjoy the style and manners of Sir Percival's close friend, Count Fosco (Simon Callow)...and do we eventually realize the foul depths of depravity, as well as the power of honor and true love, that humanity is capable of? Do we visit Victorian insane asylums, see falls from high towers, dig open graves in the middle of the night and watch retribution arrive amidst the roaring flames of a locked church?Well, of course, and it's a grand journey for us.This BBC/Masterpiece Theater program features fine acting and outstanding production values. To fit Collins' 500-plus-page novel into a television show of less than 120 minutes means a good deal had to be cut or abridged, and some changes were made most likely to achieve greater impact in the little time available. Still, taken on its own terms, the production of The Woman in White in my opinion works very well as a moody, romantic, dark television tale. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a commanding performance as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever feat of slowly letting us see the depraved slime beneath the skin, who still has charm amidst the villainy. Ian Richardson as the young women's uncle almost steals the show. He gives such a bossy and pungent performance it almost unbalances the story every time he appears. Perhaps the weakest of the main parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco. The Count is simply a monster, yet a supremely civilized and charming one. Collins described him as being of immense girth. Callow does a fine, mannered job of it, but to me he lacks a little of the monstrosity of evil.At one point, Marian tells us, ""My sister and I are so fond of Gothic novels, we sometimes act as if we were in them."" Little did she know what was in store for herself and Laura.The DVD transfer is fine although a little soft.

The BBC is known for doing in depth productions spanning 4&5 hours of books, and THE WOMAN IN WHITE certainly could have benefitted by that type of production.  Instead, they did what Hollywood frequently does, and take one major story thread of a book and turn that into a 2 hour movie, greatly discarding and cutting elements.  In other words, they take the idea and make all elelments work for that idea.  It DOES work.  This adaptation is beautiful to look at, frame after frame looking like Marie Cassat paintings, and the drawn out, near-torturous suspense of the book is captured, even in this short version.  It is true to the book in feeling, not details.Unlike other viewers, I was aghast and really disgusted by the casting of the remarkably delicate and beautiful Tara Fitzgerald in this film. That alone is what makes this a 4 star film for me, and not 5.  While she does have the brains and fire for Marian, the character is supposed to be almost hideous to look at, disturbingly masculine in form and manner, as ugly outside as she is heroic and beautiful inside.  There was not even an attempt made in that direction for Ms. Fitzgerald.  Horrible, unforgivable miscasting which colors every single element of the story.  So forget the book.This film is the story of two pretty sisters who read and live a gothic novel existence.  Justine Waddel is in so many films I love - what a charmed career she leads.  She is always fine, always a bit dazed and limp, rather bland, but she has such a slack-jawed cherubic face and reed thin coltish frame, we feel for her, and hate to see her tortured, as she invariably is.  She is perfectly cast in the role of Laura, and the sister/family resemblance casting throughout is really wonderful.Susan Vidler's Anne Catheric is wrenching, and the writing of her lines is a dead-on disturbing combination of deadpan innapropriate sexuality (""Do you want some?"") and mental instability.  Kika Martin's Madame Fosco is breathtakingly harrowing.  She brings the complex character of the book into her few scenes intact by the frozen look of searching pain on her face.  The stand out performance is Adie Allen as Margaret Porcher.  Her presence grows from utilitarian to sultry to malignant, and she is just magnificent.  In a role significantly cut down in importance from the book to this screen adaptation, she retains her presence.  Margaret is to this story what Mrs. Danvers is to Rebecca, and it is so refeshing to see her cast as voluptous and earthy.I don't say much about the men because this version uses them only as devices to advance the women's story.  Mr. Hartwritght is handsome ... although his facial hair is at times anacronistic. (Why the ""soul patch"" under his lip in the last scenes? was he allready in production of another movie that required it?)  James Wilby, perhaps best known from HOWARD'S END, plays a similarly unromantic and downright nasty role here as Sir Percival Glyde.  Unlike other reviewers, I found Simon Callow wonderful... who else has that combination of attractiveness and revulsion.

If you were hoping to watch this in order to write your term paper without reading the book you are plum out of luck.  However, if you have not read the book (which is probably most people) or if you are open minded enough to judge the movie on it's own merit, instead of comparing it to the book, you'll like this.  I've read the book, and I enjoy this TV version very much.It's the gothic story of two half sisters, Marian and Laura.  Marian is practical and capable.  She also has no money to speak of.  Laura is more fragile and fairly helpless.  She is an heiress.  Laura is engaged to marry Sir Percival Glyde, a really handsome aristocrat, whose lovely manners and attentions to Laura and friendliness to Marian would seem to make him the ideal husband for Laura.  However, Marian senses something amiss that she cannot put her finger on--as well she should.  Meanwhile a mysterious, ethereal woman clad all in white begings making ghostly appearances, popping up in graveyards, making cryptic comments, then running away.  Thus we know we have a good mystery ahead of us.The mood is cast brilliantly.  The music is absolutely haunting.  I can't believe other reviewers did not mention the gorgeous music that sets the gothic tone of the program right from the start.  The filming locations also add to the mood.  People are always wandering around in graveyards.  The woman in white hugs and lovingly caresses tombstones.  Sir Percivals house is a masterpiece.  It's a huge English country house, but is in terrible disrepair with peeling paint and furniture shrouded in ghostly dustcovers.  The grounds are elaborate gardens, now neglected and overgrown.  Very haunting.It probably goes without saying that the costumes were fantastic.  The BBC always does a good job of that.  Sir Percial's beautifully tailored clothing in comparison to the state of his house mirrors the difference between the very handsome Sir Percial the world sees as opposed to the real Sir Perical beneath the surface attractiveness.I'm completely happy with this DVD, glad I bought it.  It's worth watching and rewatching.

As this is a Masterpiece Theatre production, there is an introduction and a conclusion that is included, but not part of the actual film.

This includes the the ""Paris scene"" as one reviewer distressingly noted--which ties up the loose ends concerning Count Fosco.Noting that they wanted to make a 2 hour film, they did a superb job.  And, really, this film would be more fun if you haven't read the book so please don't let that deter you if you haven't read the book.  Actually, if you haven't read the book, I'd suggest you see the film first. That will make you go out and want to read the book immediately-- and you won't be disappointed with either!The first two-thirds of this movie was very good; the last, superb.  I thought the casting was good although, admittedly, Count Fosco was an odd choice.  Still, it worked-- he had an immense amount of charm, and and immense amount of evil-- the only thing that he lacked was his immense weight.I thought the script and the casting were perfect. Maybe the only thing that faltered a bit was the direction and I'm not certain as to what could have been better.

I can understand modifications were necessary to trim a 645-page down to 2 hours, but my goodness, this film was very liberal in treating the classic book that it was based on. I mean, they changed SO MUCH, I was half expecting some zombie action to occur. I needed to read this book for my book club and could not finish it, so I retreated to the film so that it would motivate me to read the book till the end. The film as a standalone is quite entertaining, it was intriguing--in fact, it did what it was supposed to do and I finished the rest of the book in one sitting. However, I had to forget the film's story because they were so different from the book. I pity those who need to write a book report and would watch this film instead -- instant F in my opinion. Scenes that were not in the book were added and important details about mistaken identities were muddied up. This was a 1997 film too so no-one really famous (except for a supporting character who appeared in ""Love Actually"" -- the guy who fell in love with Keira Knightley) was in it and the film looks older than it really is--both in texture and treatment. I was surprised that they needed to change so many details when the book itself offered so many interesting events and characters. I particularly found Mrs. Catherick very enjoyable to read about.

""Women in White"" is a novel that was written for Dickens' literary magazine and appeared in serialization about the same time that ""A Tale of Two Cities"" was also being published.The novel itself is 720 pages long and has (if memory serves from fifth grade reading) five narrators.  This film treatment resolves on a single narrator, Marian Fairlie (Fitzgerald) the half poor sister of Laura, who got all the money.The story opens with Walter Hartright (Lincoln) coming to the Fairlie estates to be an art tutor for the girls.  He falls in love with Laura, but this love cannot be.  Laura is engaged to wed another, Sir Percival Glyde.He also encounters a mysterious woman in white out on the moonlit lawn.  Anne Catherick (Vidler) is the daughter of a servant who became insane and was generously hospitalized by Sir Percival.After Laura is wed, Marian is to come live with them.  She arrives after the honeymoon and discovers her sister is badly abused and traumatized.  Sir Percival is clearly out to get Laura's money with the help of his Italian cousin, Count Fosco (Callow).The sisters plan an escape by moonlight. Unfortunately, the escape fails and Marian awakens from a fever to learn her sister Laura jumped from the tower of Glyde's estate.She doesn't believe in the suicide and vowing vengeance, she contacts Hartright and they search for the truth.  They must find the will of their father, which apparently will answer all of their questions.Most people who read will say they liked the book better than the film.  With a few very notable exceptions, this is true in my case as well.  In all fairness to the film's creators, it would be very difficult to collapse the original Wilkie novel into a movie length version.  Their interpretation is interesting, but yes lacking.I do like both, actually, though the movie a good deal less than the original Wilkie masterwork (which was his personal favorite of his works as well).  My one issue with the film is it didn't create the environment the book did.  The book was much stronger and more evocative landscape.Still, Tara Fitzgerald is to be commended for telling Marian's tale and managing to convey so much of the depth of the story on such a narrow perspective.  SHe truly is an amazingly talented actress.

However, if it is taken as a movie inspired by Wilkie Collins' The Woman In White, or as a very loose adaptation, then one might perhaps enjoy it, as I certainly did.The story here [I am not going to compare it to the novel for there are many liberties taken with it in this movie version] centers around a pair of half-sisters who share a very close bond with each other - Marian [Tara Fitzgerald] is poor, and her sister Laura [Justine Waddell] is rich due to an inheritance from her mother. They both live with their decrepit eccentric uncle, Mr Fairlie [Ian Richardson] who has engaged a tutor for the girls, a Mr Walter Hartright [Andrew Lincoln] who immediately forms a close attachment to Laura. However, this attachment doesn't go very far for Laura is engaged to Sir Percival Glyde [James Wilby] who simpers and appears eager to please.Amidst this setting, enters a mysterious character, a woman in white who appears at first to Mr Hartwright as he is walking to Mr Fairlie's estate at night, and then to the sisters. She turns out to be Anne Catherick [Susan Vilder] an escapee from an insane asylum who seems mentally unstable but passes cryptic comments that pique the interest of the sisters and Mr Hartwright. She alludes to a secret about Sir Glyde, but when confronted, he offers up convincing excuses.The plot gets more complicated and events turn more sinister when Mr Hartwright is sent off packing by a scandal involving a servant, protesting his innocence all the way. Laura marries Sir Percival, and when Marian goes to the Glyde estate to await them after their honeymoon, she is greeted by a wan and taciturn Laura, who seems fearful of her new husband. Matters get worse when a sinister figure called Count Fosco [Simon Callow] arrives as Sir Percival's guest and after that events take one malignant turn after another. It is left to Marian to put the pieces of the puzzle together and get to the bottom of things, all centred around the woman in white, Anne Catherick and her cryptic remarks.The story as it unfolds here is riveting - the plot is well-written [if you stop comparing it to the novel, and provide for the time constraint, where the 500+ book is squeezed into a 2 hr movie] and the acting is above average. Though Tara Fitzgerald is a bit too pretty to play the role of Marian, she is very convincing in her role as the determined, and bold sister who attempts to solve the mystery despite all odds. Justine Waddell who has made a career of playing period roles, from the tragic Tess in Tess of the D'urbervilles and also in Wives and Daughters, is also convincing as the naive and trusting Laura. I also thought Susan Vidler's Anne Catherick to be intriguing and well-portrayed, conveying a truly tragic and sad character. Adie Allen's servant turned housekeeper turned mistress of her own home, Margaret Porcher was well-done indeed, convincingly portraying the transformation of her character from servile to malignant.The men are not altogether memorable, and I feel that here it was a bit of a letdown for the character of the Count especially. He was a truly malignant character in the book, yet here we don't really see that development all that clearly, and Simon Callow seems to be a bit insipid in his portrayal of the ruthless Count. James Wilby is oily enough as Sir Percival Glyde and Ian Richardson is actually quite a scene stealer in his portrayal of the decrepit, fussy uncle. But on the whole, it is the female actors who bring depth to the story.The sets are wonderful, and the cinematography is well-done. The lighting and other technical elements serve to heighten the atmosphere, providing a lush and suitably sinister backdrop to a gothic story of suspense and evil.I liked this retelling of the classic and though it does not do justice to Wilkie Collin's masterpiece, this is definitely a movie that can be enjoyed on its own merits and taken as an inspired take on the classic tale.",4,"This can be enjoyed as a movie inspired by Wilkie Collin's work, not as an adaptation",1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,4115,"['are', 'purist', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'see', 'favorite', 'book', 'chopped', 'up', 'when', 'translated', 'big', 'screen', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'offend', 'sensibilities', 'However', 'taken', 'movie', 'inspired', 'Wilkie', 'Collins', 'Woman', 'White', 'very', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'then', 'one', 'might', 'perhaps', 'enjoy', 'certainly', 'did.The', 'story', 'here', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'compare', 'novel', 'are', 'many', 'liberties', 'taken', 'movie', 'version', ']', 'centers', 'pair', 'half-sisters', 'who', 'share', 'very', 'close', 'bond', 'other', 'Marian', '[', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', ']', 'poor', 'sister', 'Laura', '[', 'Justine', 'Waddell', ']', 'rich', 'due', 'inheritance', 'mother', 'live', 'decrepit', 'eccentric', 'uncle', 'Mr', 'Fairlie', '[', 'Ian', 'Richardson', ']', 'who', 'engaged', 'tutor', 'girls', 'Mr', 'Walter', 'Hartright', '[', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', ']', 'who', 'immediately', 'close', 'attachment', 'Laura', 'However', 'attachment', ""n't"", 'go', 'very', 'far', 'Laura', 'engaged', 'Sir', 'Percival', 'Glyde', '[', 'James', 'Wilby', ']', 'who', 'simpers', 'eager', 'please.Amidst', 'setting', 'mysterious', 'character', 'woman', 'white', 'who', 'first', 'Mr', 'Hartwright', 'walking', 'Mr', 'Fairlie', 'estate', 'night', 'then', 'sisters', 'out', 'be', 'Anne', 'Catherick', '[', 'Susan', 'Vilder', ']', 'escapee', 'insane', 'asylum', 'who', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'cryptic', 'comments', 'pique', 'interest', 'sisters', 'Mr', 'Hartwright', 'secret', 'Sir', 'Glyde', 'when', 'confronted', 'up', 'convincing', 'excuses.The', 'plot', 'more', 'complicated', 'events', 'turn', 'more', 'sinister', 'when', 'Mr', 'Hartwright', 'sent', 'off', 'packing', 'scandal', 'involving', 'servant', 'protesting', 'innocence', 'way', 'Laura', 'marries', 'Sir', 'Percival', 'when', 'Marian', 'Glyde', 'estate', 'await', 'honeymoon', 'greeted', 'wan', 'taciturn', 'Laura', 'who', 'fearful', 'new', 'husband', 'Matters', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'sinister', 'figure', 'called', 'Count', 'Fosco', '[', 'Simon', 'Callow', ']', 'Sir', 'Percival', 'guest', 'events', 'take', 'one', 'malignant', 'turn', 'left', 'Marian', 'put', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'together', 'get', 'bottom', 'things', 'centred', 'woman', 'white', 'Anne', 'Catherick', 'cryptic', 'remarks.The', 'story', 'here', 'riveting', 'plot', 'well-written', '[', 'stop', 'comparing', 'novel', 'provide', 'time', 'constraint', 'where', '500+', 'book', 'squeezed', '2', 'hr', 'movie', ']', 'acting', 'above', 'average', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'bit', 'too', 'pretty', 'play', 'role', 'Marian', 'very', 'convincing', 'role', 'determined', 'bold', 'sister', 'who', 'solve', 'mystery', 'odds', 'Justine', 'Waddell', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'period', 'roles', 'tragic', 'Tess', 'Tess', ""D'urbervilles"", 'also', 'Wives', 'Daughters', 'also', 'convincing', 'naive', 'trusting', 'Laura', 'also', 'thought', 'Susan', 'Vidler', 'Anne', 'Catherick', 'be', 'intriguing', 'well-portrayed', 'conveying', 'truly', 'tragic', 'sad', 'character', 'Adie', 'Allen', 'servant', 'turned', 'housekeeper', 'turned', 'mistress', 'own', 'home', 'Margaret', 'Porcher', 'was', 'well-done', 'indeed', 'convincingly', 'portraying', 'transformation', 'character', 'servile', 'malignant.The', 'men', 'are', 'not', 'altogether', 'memorable', 'feel', 'here', 'was', 'bit', 'letdown', 'character', 'Count', 'especially', 'was', 'truly', 'malignant', 'character', 'book', 'yet', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'development', 'clearly', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'be', 'bit', 'insipid', 'portrayal', 'ruthless', 'Count', 'James', 'Wilby', 'oily', 'enough', 'Sir', 'Percival', 'Glyde', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'actually', 'quite', 'scene', 'stealer', 'portrayal', 'decrepit', 'fussy', 'uncle', 'whole', 'female', 'actors', 'who', 'bring', 'depth', 'story.The', 'sets', 'are', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'well-done', 'lighting', 'other', 'technical', 'elements', 'serve', 'heighten', 'atmosphere', 'providing', 'lush', 'suitably', 'sinister', 'backdrop', 'gothic', 'story', 'suspense', 'evil.I', 'liked', 'retelling', 'classic', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'Wilkie', 'Collin', 'masterpiece', 'definitely', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'own', 'merits', 'taken', 'inspired', 'take', 'classic', 'tale']",N/A
