1358888,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B003QF1N52,D.P.,"[9, 9]","After being an ex-Marine & a New Orleans detective, John Cena returns to another WWE film with ""Legendary.""  The movie revolves about a book-smart teenager named Calvin Chetley a.k.a. ""Cal"" (Devon Graye) who goes to high school in Oklahoma, lives with his mom Sharon (Patricia Clarkson), has a female best friend name Lulu (Madeleine Martin) who clearly has more than just ""friendship"" feelings for him which he's obivious to, and developed a friendship with an older man (Danny Glover) who looks out for him with good advice.  He goes out for the wrestling team knowing the history with his brother & late-father having success in the sport, despite the fact that his mother is against it, but just has no luck at it.  On the other side is Cal's brother Mike (Cena) who is a former All-American but very distant from his family, hard on his luck, and somehow keeps getting into trouble.  Cal asked Mike to help train him initially & refused until Cal helped him out in court causing Mike to return the favor & train Cal leading to the brothers bonding together & Cal having better success wrestling.  However they both still have to deal with issues throughout the movie like facing the issue that caused Mike to be so distant from not just Cal but his mother, Lulu & Cal's relationship evolving into something more, and Mike's past catching up to him.This movie was unlike any previous WWE film in that this wasn't an action based movie as it was more focused on being a more serious family drama.  Cena's role in the movie was very similar to Mr. Kennedy's (now Mr. Anderson in Total Nonstop Action wrestling) role in a previous WWE film ""Behind Enemy Lines: Columbia"" where he played more of a supporting role than the main character he was in his previous two movies.  I think this was definately Cena's best acting effort as his first two movies had him playing the sterotypical strong ""superman"" good guy while he showed diversity here with him playing a guy who clearly had some emotional issues with a bad attitude in the first half of the film.  The acting with everyone else was very good & the best cast put together for a WWE film to date along with the multiple stories being told throughout the film.  In the end, I enjoyed the movie & stories being told (I've personally had a situation like this happened to me so I could heavily relate) so I would recommend this for a viewing.",4,WWE Studios First Drama...And A Pretty Good One,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,2395,"['being', 'ex-Marine', 'New', 'Orleans', 'detective', 'John', 'Cena', 'WWE', 'film', 'Legendary', 'movie', 'book-smart', 'teenager', 'named', 'Calvin', 'Chetley', 'a.k.a', 'Cal', 'Devon', 'Graye', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'Oklahoma', 'mom', 'Sharon', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'female', 'best', 'friend', 'name', 'Lulu', 'Madeleine', 'Martin', 'who', 'clearly', 'more', 'just', 'friendship', 'feelings', 'obivious', 'developed', 'friendship', 'older', 'man', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'who', 'out', 'good', 'advice', 'out', 'wrestling', 'team', 'knowing', 'history', 'brother', 'late-father', 'having', 'success', 'sport', 'fact', 'mother', 'just', 'luck', 'other', 'side', 'Cal', 'brother', 'Mike', 'Cena', 'who', 'former', 'All-American', 'very', 'distant', 'family', 'hard', 'luck', 'somehow', 'keeps', 'getting', 'trouble', 'Cal', 'asked', 'Mike', 'help', 'train', 'initially', 'refused', 'Cal', 'helped', 'out', 'court', 'causing', 'Mike', 'return', 'favor', 'train', 'Cal', 'leading', 'brothers', 'bonding', 'together', 'Cal', 'having', 'better', 'success', 'wrestling', 'However', 'still', 'have', 'deal', 'issues', 'movie', 'facing', 'issue', 'caused', 'Mike', 'be', 'so', 'distant', 'not', 'just', 'Cal', 'mother', 'Lulu', 'Cal', 'relationship', 'evolving', 'something', 'more', 'Mike', 'past', 'catching', 'up', 'him.This', 'movie', 'was', 'previous', 'WWE', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'action', 'based', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'focused', 'being', 'more', 'serious', 'family', 'drama', 'Cena', 'role', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'similar', 'Mr.', 'Kennedy', 'now', 'Mr.', 'Anderson', 'Total', 'Nonstop', 'Action', 'wrestling', 'role', 'previous', 'WWE', 'film', 'Enemy', 'Lines', 'Columbia', 'where', 'played', 'more', 'supporting', 'role', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'think', 'was', 'definately', 'Cena', 'best', 'acting', 'effort', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'had', 'playing', 'sterotypical', 'strong', 'superman', 'good', 'guy', 'showed', 'diversity', 'here', 'playing', 'guy', 'who', 'clearly', 'had', 'emotional', 'issues', 'bad', 'attitude', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'acting', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'best', 'cast', 'put', 'together', 'WWE', 'film', 'date', 'multiple', 'stories', 'being', 'told', 'film', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'stories', 'being', 'told', ""'ve"", 'personally', 'had', 'situation', 'happened', 'could', 'heavily', 'relate', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewing']",Legendary

1358891,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B003QF1N52,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 2]","Mel Damski, the director of this flick, has a history comprised almost entirely of work in television and it shows here. This is a short putt from being an 'after school special.'Here's the scoop. Cal Chetley is a bright, good-hearted high school student. He lives with mom. Dad died in a car accident some years earlier. His older brother hasn't been around in years. He has a casual, but affectionate, relationship with a very sweet and left of center neighbor named Luli. As the bookish type he tends to be put upon by  some of his school chums. He wants to join the school wrestling team to help beef up his physical confidence and hopefully bring his brother back to the family who, himself, was a championship wrestler. It's a tough road.This is a well intended, paint by numbers endeavor. There are few surprises but I didn't really care much because I liked the characters. Patricia Clarkson, as the mom, is always good and she does well with what she's given. John Cena is decent as the big brother. He's separated himself from his family for reasons which are made clear later in the movie. He's a laborer who lives in a trailer, drinks and fights a lot which leads to issues with the law, and has a string of girlfriends with whom he cannot become intimate. Will he help coach little brother to a title and will he get back with the family and kill the demons inside of him? Danny Glover is one of the locals and provides the voice of reason to Cal, played nicely by Devon Grey. Madelein Martin, as Luli Stringfellow, is a hoot. She's as sweet as can be and has a sense all her own. She marches to a different drummer and has a thing for Cal.Like I said, there is no ground being broken here. You've seen it all before and it sets out to manipulate the audience which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes I like being led around by the nose, particularly in something such as this where you want these people to succeed. They're good people trying to get their lives back on track.

I thought ""The Marine"" was a fun pointless action movie and that ""12 Rounds"" while seeming like a ""Die Hard"" spin off was just as fun. This was Cena's third film for WWE and I have to say that it may be his best. It is a realistic drama in which John had to actually act and he was in a co starring role. For some reason when this first came out I wanted to see this more so than any other he had been in.Cal Chetley [Devon Graye] is one of those kids who is just an outcast and is having problems at home. His mother [Patricia Clarkson] is over protective, his father is dead, and his older brother [Cena] is the black sheep of the family. While he is a scrawny guy he wants to join the schools wrestling team like his father and brother did before him. the thing is he knows nothing about it and his mother is strongly against it.Now I know some of you are reading that and are saying ""that does not sound to interesting"". Well if you were thinking that then you would be very wrong for thinking that, especially seeing Cena in this type of film. I have to say that I was very impressed by John here in this film as the brother who has to come back to help his little bro. He is actually really good here especially during the first half of the film. Seeing him play the drunk outcast haunted by his past it is new side of Cena. The last half is more of the guy that you see in the WWE helping out kids and such. Don't get me wrong the role called for that but still.Devon is really good here in the lead role and makes the film more believable. And for any out there that says a kid like that would never make it in amateur wrestling has no idea what they are talking about. As someone who wrestled all throughout school and trains it every day even now I can tell you the little guys are usually the nastiest and most hard workers. Was I one of those guys, maybe, maybe not. Patricia is also excellent here as their mother and Danny Glover is always fun.I was glad to see Mel Damski directed this since he is a producer and directed many episodes of one of my favorite shows of all time, ""Psych"". Also it should be noted that the writer of this film John Posey is also in the film as Coach Tennent. He did a good job on both fronts. Anyway this is actually a good film from the WWE and is one of the few dramatic films they have made.

That sounds a lot like a line you'd here in a war movie doesn't it ? Legendary isn't a war movie though, it's about high school wrestling. Yet, when Cal Chetley (Devon Graye) reveals to his mother Sharon (Patricia Clarkson) that he wants to join the wrestling team, she reacts as if he said he wants to join the marines.Cal's brother Mike (John Cena) and his father were so into wrestling that the father died in a car accident on the way to scope out one of Mike's opponents. So Mike is now a drunk bar fighting loner that keeps himself as far away from his family as possible due to blaming himself. When Cal needs to get better at wrestling, he goes see Mike behind his mother's back. Mike is hard to convince at first, but of course Cal eventually gets his help.Cal becomes more confident, gets a girlfriend and takes on his bullies, no this isn't the Karate Kid. The film is over the top sentimental, but it won me over anyway due to Graye and yes John Cena having chemistry. The film even got a tear or 2 out of me.Cena, I found surprisingly solid in the first half. I bought that he was a troubled man and he was better than usual and I almost believed that he could act. In the second half when he becomes nicer and a role model, he just phones in his performance and is about as wooden as he usually is in movies. Madeleine Martin however was adorable as Cal's girlfriend. Legendary may not be original but compared to all the other WWE films it's the best. It's a good family film.",3,One of the WWE's better films,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,1571,"['told', 'father', ""'d"", 'watch', 'out', 'anything', 'ever', 'happened', 'lot', 'line', ""'d"", 'here', 'war', 'movie', ""n't"", 'Legendary', ""n't"", 'war', 'movie', 'about', 'high', 'school', 'wrestling', 'when', 'Cal', 'Chetley', 'Devon', 'Graye', 'mother', 'Sharon', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'join', 'wrestling', 'team', 'as', 'said', 'join', 'marines.Cal', 'brother', 'Mike', 'John', 'Cena', 'father', 'were', 'so', 'wrestling', 'father', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'way', 'scope', 'out', 'one', 'Mike', 'opponents', 'So', 'Mike', 'now', 'drunk', 'bar', 'fighting', 'loner', 'far', 'away', 'family', 'possible', 'due', 'blaming', 'When', 'Cal', 'get', 'better', 'wrestling', 'see', 'Mike', 'mother', 'back', 'Mike', 'hard', 'convince', 'first', 'course', 'Cal', 'eventually', 'help.Cal', 'more', 'confident', 'girlfriend', 'bullies', ""n't"", 'Karate', 'Kid', 'film', 'top', 'sentimental', 'won', 'over', 'anyway', 'due', 'Graye', 'yes', 'John', 'Cena', 'having', 'chemistry', 'film', 'even', 'got', 'tear', '2', 'me.Cena', 'found', 'surprisingly', 'solid', 'first', 'half', 'bought', 'was', 'troubled', 'man', 'was', 'better', 'usual', 'almost', 'believed', 'could', 'act', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'nicer', 'role', 'model', 'just', 'phones', 'performance', 'about', 'as', 'wooden', 'usually', 'movies', 'Madeleine', 'Martin', 'however', 'was', 'adorable', 'Cal', 'girlfriend', 'Legendary', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'original', 'compared', 'other', 'WWE', 'films', 'best', 'good', 'family', 'film']",Legendary
