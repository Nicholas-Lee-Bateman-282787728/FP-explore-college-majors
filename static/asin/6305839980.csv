480671,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305839980,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","While watching `Possession' I had this aching feeling that I was watching something truly conducive of everything that defines a true vision.  It felt like an amalgam of celebrated auteurs combing their skills to create something organically unorganic.  It was like the love child of David Lynch and Lars von Trier decided to channel David Cronenberg in his reimagining of Ingmar Bergman's classic `Scenes From a Marriage'.Seriously.`Possession' tells the story of a crumbling marriage.  Anna and Mark are at the end of their marriage after Mark returns home from months away on business to find that his wife has been carrying on an affair with Heinrich.  Anna, obviously manic and unstable, flees her life, leaving Mark and their young son alone and desperate.  Mark is intent on finding Anna, whom he assumes is merely shacking up with Heinrich, but the truth is that there is something much fiercer, much darker lying beneath his wife's apparent hysteria.  Anna has given birth to a tentacled creature who has now become her lover, a grotesque creature who remains in an abandoned building and fornicates with Anna, driving her further into madness.This all sounds so ridiculously bizarre and yet director Andrzej Zulawski keeps any diversions into camp at bay and actually creates a brilliantly concocted ode to divorce, one that completely understands its purpose and instills in us a true feeling of honest desperation.At the core of `Possession' is Zulawski's fabricated portrayal of his own divorce, a time that left him in obvious dismay.  This film is a dark and ominous look at the mental frailties that can rear their heads when the end of something dear to you has come to pass.  Both Anna and Mark are reduced to disturbed variations of their former selves as they come face to face with the brutal truth about their crumbling relationship.  Anna, possessed of lust for her new lover and quite literal soulmate, is completely lost within her own inhibitions, and Mark, lost in his attempt to understand why his wife is so intent on following her newfound pursuit, sinks into a deeper hole of madness and hysteria.  While on the surface, `Possession' feels like a horror film designed for mere shock-value, but when one digs a little deeper they see a sharper and more intellectual aspect of this twisted tale that makes it so much more than what it appears to be.Oh, and Isabelle Adjanu should have won an Oscar for this.",5,My soul is bleeding...,1330560000,"03 1, 2012",2012,2436,"['watching', 'Possession', 'had', 'aching', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'something', 'truly', 'conducive', 'everything', 'true', 'vision', 'felt', 'amalgam', 'celebrated', 'auteurs', 'combing', 'skills', 'create', 'something', 'organically', 'unorganic', 'was', 'love', 'child', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'decided', 'channel', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'reimagining', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'classic', 'Scenes', ""Marriage'.Seriously."", 'Possession', 'story', 'crumbling', 'marriage', 'Anna', 'Mark', 'are', 'end', 'marriage', 'Mark', 'home', 'months', 'away', 'business', 'find', 'wife', 'been', 'carrying', 'affair', 'Heinrich', 'Anna', 'obviously', 'manic', 'unstable', 'life', 'leaving', 'Mark', 'young', 'son', 'alone', 'desperate', 'Mark', 'intent', 'finding', 'Anna', 'whom', 'merely', 'shacking', 'up', 'Heinrich', 'truth', 'something', 'much', 'fiercer', 'much', 'darker', 'lying', 'wife', 'apparent', 'hysteria', 'Anna', 'given', 'birth', 'tentacled', 'creature', 'who', 'now', 'become', 'lover', 'grotesque', 'creature', 'who', 'abandoned', 'building', 'fornicates', 'Anna', 'driving', 'further', 'madness.This', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'bizarre', 'yet', 'director', 'Andrzej', 'Zulawski', 'diversions', 'camp', 'bay', 'actually', 'brilliantly', 'concocted', 'ode', 'divorce', 'one', 'completely', 'purpose', 'instills', 'true', 'feeling', 'honest', 'core', 'Possession', 'Zulawski', 'fabricated', 'portrayal', 'own', 'divorce', 'time', 'left', 'obvious', 'dismay', 'film', 'dark', 'ominous', 'look', 'mental', 'frailties', 'can', 'rear', 'heads', 'when', 'end', 'something', 'dear', 'come', 'pass', 'Anna', 'Mark', 'are', 'reduced', 'disturbed', 'variations', 'former', 'selves', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'brutal', 'truth', 'crumbling', 'relationship', 'Anna', 'possessed', 'lust', 'new', 'lover', 'quite', 'literal', 'soulmate', 'completely', 'lost', 'own', 'inhibitions', 'Mark', 'lost', 'attempt', 'understand', 'why', 'wife', 'so', 'intent', 'following', 'newfound', 'pursuit', 'deeper', 'hole', 'madness', 'hysteria', 'surface', 'Possession', 'feels', 'horror', 'film', 'designed', 'mere', 'shock-value', 'when', 'one', 'little', 'deeper', 'see', 'sharper', 'more', 'intellectual', 'aspect', 'twisted', 'tale', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'be.Oh', 'Isabelle', 'Adjanu', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar']",N/A

I found the film disturbing. it stars Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill in one of his earliest roles as Anna and Mark, a married couple on the brink of divorce. Mark discovers that Anna is having an affair with a German martial arts expert named Heinrich. The fights between Mark and Anna as a result of this infedelity are layered in the film through a series of explosive confrontations both in private and in public. There is a no holds barred element in the film with scenes involving physical confrontations between Mark and Anna that I found difficult to watch. Isabelle Adjani is one of the most courageous actresses I have ever seen. In one scene when she goes through convulsions in a subway, it is without question the most disturbing moment in the film, clearly influenced by Linda Blair's possession scenes in The Exorcist. the level of intensity takes the performances to the extreme.There is a surreal portion of the film that is Anna has taken refuge in an abandoned flat where a private investigator hired by Mark has tracked her down. Inside the bedroom, there is an actual creature in her bed. The creature represents Anna's uncontrolled anxiety that she has given birth to.

A Deeply disturbing and thought-provoking piece, played by its cast at an  unflinching fever pitch (Adjani and Neill seem to be shouting at each other  through most of the film), Possession is a curious blend of several genres:  art house, Grand Guignol, sexflick, spy thriller, psychological drama (a la  The Ice Storm, although the marital chill here is much icier)...and  more.Set in Berlin during the Cold War and filmed in English by Polish  director Zulawski, we have here an outrageously sick tale (it remains  banned in the UK to this very day) of an extremely 'paranoid' (or is he?)  husband whose spying on his cheating wife takes him on a nightmare journey  that involves espionage, doppelgangers and dream lovers, men in pink socks  who could bring about the End of the World, and a truly Freudian  many-tentacled creature (designed by Alien's Carlo Rambaldi) that is a  monster classic out there with the best of them.Possession holds our  attention much as a deformed exhibit in a circus sideshow does.

If you haven't seen this movie about a woman  who gives birth to a tentacled monster who she sleeps with...you don't know  what you're missing!  It's a camp riot, although it does have some creepy  moments, and this Uncut version is the only way to go.  One of my favorite  scenes is the very long abortion sequence with Adjani in the subway which  always leaves me in hysterics!  There's so much flair and histrionics  going on throughout this film that you will DEFINITELY not be bored ----  it's a great ridiculous ride into Euro-Horror.  Adjani is completely Wacky  and the creature effects are slimy and there's gore and sex.  Even bland  Sam Neill has more personality than usual.  It's an incredible ride ---  sometimes intensely silly, over-acted and flamboyant --- but it's  definitely one-of-a-kind.  If you like euro-trash, you'll most likely eat  this up.  Other viewers may shake their heads in disbelief.  The DVD also  has the international and US trailers (both good) and a commentary by the  director.

480684,AR61Y2VWLST1V,6305839980,"Holly Apollyon ""Messiah of Regret and Entropy""","[5, 7]","Firstly, I gotta say, that chick Anna was as hot as this movie is bizarre. I recognized her as the girl from that kooky Klaus Kinski version of Nosferatu. Holy Hannah! Picture a kind of slender, sylphish beauty, almost impossibly pale and perfect, with contrasting dark hair and dark eyes. If you've ever read the Death Dealer novels, she is exactly how I would picture the sorceress Cobra. This chick can take the edge of a screwball movie like nobody's business.This guy (it's Grant from Jurassic Park---you gotta love that guy) comes home from some sort of ambiguous job to find out that his wife Anna has been cheating and is pretty much ready for splitsville. The guy goes nuts---and all you have to do is look at Anna to understand why. So, he embarks on a kind of nonlinear quest to wipe out the competition. At first he's convinced that Anna is with this one spaced-out jerkweed, but it becomes evident that the jerkweed is now out of the loop too. By the way, every one of these people are nuts, just absolutely out of their minds, every single one of them.He hires this private eye, and the private eye, none too subtly, traces Anna to another apartment building altogether. He manages to conive his way into the apartment, and finds this slimy bloated thing with tentacles sticking to the bathroom wall, heaving and pulsating, making little smacking wet sounds. Anna kills the private eye with a shattered wine bottle to the throat, and I guess maybe feeds him to the tentacle thing, I don't really know. Other victims follow, and Anna confesses that she's been making it with Tentacle Thing. Just think, having a fine chick like that leave you for something that looks like it was picked from a nose and wiped across a wall.All this time, the husband has been more or less taking care of the son he shares with Anna. He finds out that the son's teacher is a strange Anna clone with brown hair and pale blue contacts. She's got Anna's looks, she's much nicer, she seems sane, and most importantly she doesn't make it with slimy monsters. He has a chance to get it on with her, but, disappointingly, nothing ever really develops. Eventually, Anna kinda comes back to him, explaining that she's had relations with Tentacle Thing, to the extent that she had some kind of otherworldly miscarriage. Tentacle Thing, evidently, is evolving into something else. Things become more bizarre as the movie moves towards its climax. Somehow they even managed to throw a shoot out into the final scenes. Tentacle Thing, I guess fortified by the love of a good woman, ends up becoming an odd clone of the husband, seemingly immune to gunshots.In a way this movie reminded me of that movie Naked Lunch---you know, the one where everyone has typewriters that turn to big talking bugs. But I liked Possessed alot more; it was faster-moving, funner to watch, and DEFINITELY a step up in the chick department. I don't know if the movie had a point; if it did I missed it, but it was pretty entertaining either way.",4,Those slimy tentacle things know how to get the chicks!,1067472000,"10 30, 2003",2003,3005,"['Firstly', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'chick', 'Anna', 'was', 'as', 'hot', 'movie', 'bizarre', 'recognized', 'girl', 'kooky', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'version', 'Nosferatu', 'Holy', 'Hannah', 'Picture', 'kind', 'slender', 'sylphish', 'beauty', 'almost', 'impossibly', 'pale', 'perfect', 'contrasting', 'dark', 'hair', 'dark', 'eyes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'Death', 'Dealer', 'novels', 'exactly', 'how', 'would', 'picture', 'sorceress', 'Cobra', 'chick', 'can', 'take', 'edge', 'screwball', 'movie', 'nobody', 'business.This', 'guy', 'Grant', 'Jurassic', 'Park', '-you', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'guy', 'home', 'sort', 'ambiguous', 'job', 'find', 'out', 'wife', 'Anna', 'been', 'cheating', 'pretty', 'much', 'ready', 'splitsville', 'guy', 'nuts', '-and', 'have', 'do', 'look', 'Anna', 'understand', 'why', 'So', 'kind', 'nonlinear', 'quest', 'wipe', 'out', 'competition', 'first', 'convinced', 'Anna', 'one', 'spaced-out', 'jerkweed', 'evident', 'jerkweed', 'now', 'loop', 'too', 'way', 'one', 'people', 'are', 'nuts', 'just', 'absolutely', 'minds', 'single', 'one', 'them.He', 'hires', 'private', 'eye', 'private', 'eye', 'none', 'too', 'subtly', 'traces', 'Anna', 'apartment', 'building', 'altogether', 'conive', 'way', 'apartment', 'slimy', 'bloated', 'thing', 'tentacles', 'sticking', 'bathroom', 'wall', 'heaving', 'pulsating', 'making', 'little', 'smacking', 'wet', 'sounds', 'Anna', 'private', 'eye', 'shattered', 'wine', 'bottle', 'throat', 'guess', 'maybe', 'tentacle', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'Other', 'victims', 'follow', 'Anna', 'been', 'making', 'Tentacle', 'Thing', 'Just', 'think', 'having', 'fine', 'chick', 'leave', 'something', 'was', 'picked', 'nose', 'wiped', 'wall.All', 'time', 'husband', 'been', 'more', 'less', 'taking', 'care', 'son', 'shares', 'Anna', 'out', 'son', 'teacher', 'strange', 'Anna', 'clone', 'brown', 'hair', 'pale', 'blue', 'contacts', 'got', 'Anna', 'looks', 'much', 'nicer', 'sane', 'most', 'importantly', ""n't"", 'make', 'slimy', 'monsters', 'chance', 'get', 'disappointingly', 'nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'Eventually', 'Anna', 'kinda', 'back', 'explaining', 'had', 'relations', 'Tentacle', 'Thing', 'extent', 'had', 'kind', 'otherworldly', 'miscarriage', 'Tentacle', 'Thing', 'evidently', 'evolving', 'something', 'else', 'become', 'more', 'bizarre', 'movie', 'climax', 'Somehow', 'even', 'managed', 'throw', 'shoot', 'out', 'final', 'scenes', 'Tentacle', 'Thing', 'guess', 'fortified', 'love', 'good', 'woman', 'up', 'becoming', 'odd', 'clone', 'husband', 'seemingly', 'immune', 'gunshots.In', 'way', 'movie', 'reminded', 'movie', 'Naked', 'Lunch', '-you', 'know', 'one', 'where', 'everyone', 'typewriters', 'turn', 'big', 'talking', 'bugs', 'liked', 'Possessed', 'alot', 'more', 'was', 'faster-moving', 'funner', 'watch', 'DEFINITELY', 'step', 'up', 'chick', 'department', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'had', 'point', 'did', 'missed', 'was', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'way']",N/A

480687,AVGX4BYF7J559,6305839980,"Jer ""kingjer151""","[2, 3]","Possession is a cult horror film that was directed by Andrez Zulawski. The movie is about a man named Mark who comes home after being away for while and finds out that his wife is cheating. He at first confronts the lover and realizes that he doesn't like it but it's going to happen. After a few fights Anna moves out and visits on occasion to be with their son. But there's more wrong than he thinks. His wife has another lover that she doesn't want to talk about and may be more than he every imagined.Plot RatingLet's see. We've got an other worldly creature as Annas lover, murders, crazy marital fights, and did I mention other worldly creatures having sex with women? I can only say that I haven't seen a movie like this in a long time and one of my friends told me that the movie wouldn't make sense and at times it didn't but other times it did so there's a mixed bag of things going on. The family aspect is insane and I don't know if a child should be subjected to that kind of craziness but I'm sure there are children that have. The way the husband just accepts his wifes lovers (after going crazy for about 5 minutes of the movie) is really interesting and through all of it he still wants to be a family. Props to him. I give the plot a 7 out of 10.Actos/ActressesIsabelle Adjani plays Anna and Helen (her childs teacher). She does a good job at playing the role of a crazed woman compelled with protecting her lover and wanting to be with her family and in the movie it shows that she has a difficult time with this. She also won the best actress award for this film at the Cannes film festival and Cesar award.Sam Neill plays Mark. Hello Alan Grant. These characters are so different. It's so cool to see him in a horror film. He goes a great job at playing the jealous yet understanding husband who will stop at nothing to get his wife back. He even is a loving father but there aren't that many scenes with him and Bob.Heinz Bennent plays Heinrich the lover of Anna. He is a new aged play boy that thinks he's given Anna the world. When he finds out she has another lover he incredibly shocked. Bennent could have been played by anyone but he does a good job at being Mr. Perfect or at least in the eyes of Mark.I give the acting an 8 out 10.DVD QualityFor an 1980's film I was looking for graininess or imperfections. To my surprise this movie is rather good on the quality. It does have a little bit of age to it, such as, the filming techniques with the extreme close up kills, and the extreme close up facial expression shots and the music are all there. It's a movie that was made in the 80's but has a late 70's feel and looks like an 80's film.I give the quality a 7 out of 10.Personal ThoughtsPossession is one of those movies where you're not sure you like it or not. I thought it was good and will watch it again to try to find some deeper meanings that I may have missed or things that I didn't notice. So, do I think you should pick this up and add it to your collection? Well, if you're a big time collector then yes you should pick this up.  If you are a fan of insane women who have weird lovers,  yes, pick this up. If you don't understand horror or movies that may be a little too far out there for yourself then no I don't suggest you pick up this movie. So, there's my opinion of if you should buy it.Overall the movie gets a 22/30.",4,Possession Review,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,3370,"['Possession', 'cult', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Andrez', 'Zulawski', 'movie', 'man', 'named', 'Mark', 'who', 'home', 'being', 'away', 'while', 'out', 'wife', 'cheating', 'first', 'confronts', 'lover', ""n't"", 'like', 'going', 'happen', 'few', 'fights', 'Anna', 'out', 'visits', 'occasion', 'be', 'son', 'more', 'wrong', 'wife', 'lover', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'imagined.Plot', 'RatingLet', 'see', ""'ve"", 'got', 'other', 'worldly', 'creature', 'Annas', 'lover', 'murders', 'crazy', 'marital', 'fights', 'did', 'mention', 'other', 'worldly', 'having', 'sex', 'women', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'friends', 'told', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'other', 'times', 'did', 'so', 'mixed', 'bag', 'things', 'going', 'family', 'aspect', 'insane', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'child', 'should', 'be', 'subjected', 'kind', 'craziness', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'children', 'have', 'way', 'husband', 'just', 'accepts', 'wifes', 'lovers', 'going', 'crazy', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'really', 'interesting', 'still', 'be', 'family', 'Props', 'give', 'plot', '7', '10.Actos/ActressesIsabelle', 'Adjani', 'plays', 'Anna', 'Helen', 'childs', 'teacher', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'role', 'crazed', 'woman', 'compelled', 'protecting', 'lover', 'wanting', 'be', 'family', 'movie', 'difficult', 'time', 'also', 'won', 'best', 'actress', 'award', 'film', 'Cannes', 'film', 'festival', 'Cesar', 'award.Sam', 'Neill', 'Mark', 'Hello', 'Alan', 'Grant', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'so', 'cool', 'see', 'horror', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'jealous', 'yet', 'understanding', 'husband', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'wife', 'back', 'even', 'loving', 'father', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'scenes', 'Bob.Heinz', 'Bennent', 'Heinrich', 'lover', 'Anna', 'new', 'aged', 'play', 'boy', 'given', 'Anna', 'world', 'When', 'out', 'lover', 'incredibly', 'shocked', 'Bennent', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'anyone', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'Mr', 'Perfect', 'least', 'eyes', 'Mark.I', 'give', 'acting', '8', '10.DVD', 'QualityFor', '1980', 'film', 'was', 'looking', 'graininess', 'imperfections', 'surprise', 'movie', 'rather', 'good', 'quality', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'age', 'such', 'filming', 'techniques', 'extreme', 'close', 'up', 'kills', 'extreme', 'close', 'up', 'facial', 'expression', 'shots', 'music', 'are', 'there', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '80', 'late', '70', 'feel', '80', 'film.I', 'give', 'quality', '7', '10.Personal', 'ThoughtsPossession', 'one', 'movies', 'where', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'not', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'try', 'find', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'So', 'do', 'think', 'should', 'pick', 'up', 'add', 'collection', 'Well', ""'re"", 'big', 'time', 'collector', 'then', 'yes', 'should', 'pick', 'up', 'are', 'fan', 'insane', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'weird', 'lovers', 'yes', 'pick', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'horror', 'movies', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'there', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'So', 'opinion', 'should', 'buy', 'it.Overall', 'movie', '22/30']",N/A
480688,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,6305839980,J from NY,"[5, 6]","Zulawski's ""Possession"" affords any number of interpretations, much like David Lynch's ""Eraserhead""--the essentially banal and suffocating nature of the traditional domestic relationship, the multiciplicity of ""selves"" that we all freeze into one illusion, how civilization conspires to strangle real human affection, etc. The plot has zilch to do with the plot and can in some ways be likened to a chess match between the veneer of normalcy we must all play such a deep part in and the existential wall which drives us apart from even our most intimate partners in life. These two walls come close to drooling all over one another, each attempt at one translating into the other failing until we finally see Anna (Isabelle Adjani in a film sequence which must have resulted in some serious abdominal/neck pains, making Linda Blair's contorting in ""The Exorcist"" look almost lazy)spitting egg yolk from her mouth, screaming in torment in a subway station.The formal ""plot"" is that Mark (Sam Neil) is an unhappy--wow, that's an understatement--husband who will not alllow Anna (also Helen, his ""babysitter""? Maybe mistress?) to leave her for another man, Heinrich. Heinrich is the lie of the late 60's/early 70's counterculture. He talks about God, Zen, acceptance, practices Judo and karate, and also sleeps with Adjani's character in his mother's house. He is a greasy, false messiah who carries the specific irresponsibility of possibly having been the one to introduce God into these two maniacs' lives, and fails because he himself is a lying failure.Sam Neill said several times that this was his favorite film, and I can see why. The intensity of the dialogue, unashamedly pretentious and all the more pleasing for it, and the failed alphamale nature of his character is the best performance I have ever seen him deliver. Is this Breton's ""Mad Love"", or the director's private anguish over his own failed marriage and divorce, and his mistreatment at the hands of the Polish authorities while trying to make the film? (It was in all likelihood a similar domestic/interpersonal dilemma that sparked Lynch's ""Eraserhead"".)""God, to me, is a dog that died under my porch as a child,"" says Mark. ""There are two Sisters which may rob me--""Faith and Chance, one always steals cards from the other,"" says Anna. And Anna is busy in her spare time giving birth to a mutant child, so there isn't much time for the rearing of the child they actually have. The ending seems to be the apocalypse--is it? The flash, the detonation, the child in the bathtub? Has Anna committed the ultimate crime and given birth to something so introverted, such a product of ID, that it may be the Antichrist? Or is this film just a painting of sociological possibilities?For any lover of art films, particularly absolutely nutty over the top ones, this is a must.",5,Picasso's head exploding,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,2839,"['Zulawski', 'Possession', 'number', 'interpretations', 'much', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Eraserhead', 'essentially', 'banal', 'suffocating', 'nature', 'traditional', 'domestic', 'relationship', 'multiciplicity', 'selves', 'freeze', 'one', 'illusion', 'how', 'civilization', 'strangle', 'real', 'human', 'affection', 'etc', 'plot', 'zilch', 'do', 'plot', 'can', 'ways', 'be', 'likened', 'chess', 'match', 'veneer', 'normalcy', 'must', 'play', 'deep', 'part', 'existential', 'wall', 'apart', 'even', 'most', 'intimate', 'partners', 'life', 'two', 'walls', 'come', 'close', 'drooling', 'one', 'attempt', 'one', 'translating', 'other', 'failing', 'finally', 'see', 'Anna', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'film', 'sequence', 'must', 'have', 'resulted', 'serious', 'abdominal/neck', 'pains', 'making', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'contorting', 'Exorcist', 'look', 'almost', 'lazy', 'spitting', 'egg', 'yolk', 'mouth', 'screaming', 'torment', 'subway', 'station.The', 'formal', 'plot', 'Mark', 'Sam', 'Neil', 'unhappy', 'wow', 'understatement', 'husband', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'alllow', 'Anna', 'also', 'Helen', 'babysitter', 'Maybe', 'mistress', 'leave', 'man', 'Heinrich', 'Heinrich', 'lie', 'late', ""60's/early"", '70', 'counterculture', 'God', 'Zen', 'acceptance', 'practices', 'Judo', 'karate', 'also', 'sleeps', 'Adjani', 'character', 'mother', 'house', 'greasy', 'false', 'messiah', 'who', 'specific', 'irresponsibility', 'possibly', 'having', 'been', 'one', 'introduce', 'God', 'two', 'maniacs', 'lives', 'fails', 'lying', 'failure.Sam', 'Neill', 'said', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'favorite', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'intensity', 'dialogue', 'unashamedly', 'pretentious', 'more', 'pleasing', 'failed', 'alphamale', 'nature', 'character', 'best', 'performance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'deliver', 'Breton', 'Mad', 'Love', 'director', 'private', 'anguish', 'own', 'failed', 'marriage', 'divorce', 'mistreatment', 'hands', 'Polish', 'authorities', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'was', 'likelihood', 'similar', 'domestic/interpersonal', 'dilemma', 'sparked', 'Lynch', 'Eraserhead', 'God', 'dog', 'died', 'porch', 'child', 'Mark', 'are', 'two', 'Sisters', 'may', 'rob', 'Faith', 'Chance', 'one', 'always', 'steals', 'cards', 'other', 'Anna', 'Anna', 'busy', 'spare', 'time', 'giving', 'birth', 'mutant', 'child', ""n't"", 'much', 'time', 'rearing', 'child', 'actually', 'have', 'ending', 'be', 'apocalypse', 'flash', 'detonation', 'child', 'bathtub', 'Has', 'Anna', 'committed', 'ultimate', 'crime', 'given', 'birth', 'something', 'so', 'introverted', 'such', 'product', 'ID', 'may', 'be', 'Antichrist', 'film', 'just', 'painting', 'sociological', 'possibilities', 'lover', 'art', 'films', 'particularly', 'absolutely', 'nutty', 'top', 'ones', 'must']",N/A

The  characters are severely neurotic and seem to thrive on their bizarre  behaviour (in more ways than one) yet they are somehow all too human. Like  the movie ultimately suggests (once you get to see the secret trick the  movie plays on the two leads), this story may be like looking into a  mirror, though dark and distorted.Meet Mark (Sam Neill), an overworked  man with a mysterious job that takes him &quot;to far away places&quot;.  Meet his lovely wife, Anna (an overwhelmingly beautiful Isabelle Adjani), a  sexually frustrated housewife and former ballet instructor who has much  more than meets the eye going on for her.Between quarrels and  reconciliations, these two share a nice apartment in a quiet and well-to-do  district of Berlin and have a five year old son, Bob, but they also share a  horror that no one could have suspected, and that will make all their  fantasies and nightmares come true.After being brutally butchered by  Vestron Video for its original release, &quot;Possession&quot; has been  restored to its original lenght and sequence, therefore becoming coherent  for the viewers who used to find it mind-numbingly strange.I think of it  as a very unique piece of craftmanship, part Ingmar Bergman drama, part  Polanski suspense thriller, part Dario Argento gore, part Kubrick satire,  part Bu&ntilde;uel surrealism and still somehow, very much its own.The camera  angles, the direction, the strange whims and seizures that seem to take  over the characters (including one memorable and disturbing scene on a  subway station with Adjani pulling all the stops not ontly to her acting  abilities but to her physical strength too) are part of a very strange  style Zulawski has to tell his story.If you are accustomed to standard  horror fare, then probably you will dismiss this movie as pretentious  eurotrash (something it has been labeled off as countless times) but if  you're game and follow the sequences and let your imagination be ensnared  this will be a convulsive ride to the depths of emotion where you won't  emerge as the same person.And quite possibly, that's what all horror  movies are really about at heart.As a footnote: Isabelle Adjani won a  very deserved Gold Palm at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival for her  dual role in this film that, no matter how much you loved it or hated it,  is still unforgettable.The quality of the DVD in picture and sound is  also of note.",5,A distorted look into the mirror of love-- a must!,961977600,"06 26, 2000",2000,2704,"['many', 'years', 'acquiring', 'cult', 'status', 'mythical', 'proportions', 'Zulawski', 'quot', 'Possession', 'quot', 'finally', 'viewers', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'seen.This', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'see', 'understand', 'suppose', 'was', 'easy', 'write', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'severely', 'neurotic', 'seem', 'thrive', 'bizarre', 'behaviour', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'yet', 'are', 'somehow', 'all', 'too', 'human', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'once', 'get', 'see', 'secret', 'trick', 'movie', 'two', 'leads', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'looking', 'mirror', 'dark', 'distorted.Meet', 'Mark', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'overworked', 'man', 'mysterious', 'job', 'quot', 'far', 'away', 'places', 'quot', 'Meet', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Anna', 'overwhelmingly', 'beautiful', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'housewife', 'former', 'ballet', 'instructor', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'eye', 'going', 'her.Between', 'quarrels', 'reconciliations', 'two', 'share', 'nice', 'apartment', 'quiet', 'well-to-do', 'district', 'Berlin', 'have', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Bob', 'also', 'share', 'horror', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'suspected', 'will', 'make', 'fantasies', 'nightmares', 'come', 'true.After', 'being', 'brutally', 'butchered', 'Vestron', 'Video', 'original', 'release', 'quot', 'Possession', 'quot', 'been', 'restored', 'original', 'lenght', 'sequence', 'therefore', 'becoming', 'coherent', 'viewers', 'who', 'used', 'find', 'mind-numbingly', 'strange.I', 'think', 'very', 'unique', 'piece', 'craftmanship', 'part', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'drama', 'part', 'Polanski', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'part', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'gore', 'part', 'Kubrick', 'satire', 'part', 'Bu', 'ntilde', 'uel', 'surrealism', 'still', 'somehow', 'very', 'much', 'own.The', 'camera', 'angles', 'direction', 'strange', 'whims', 'seizures', 'seem', 'take', 'over', 'characters', 'including', 'one', 'memorable', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'subway', 'station', 'Adjani', 'pulling', 'stops', 'not', 'ontly', 'acting', 'abilities', 'physical', 'strength', 'too', 'are', 'part', 'very', 'strange', 'style', 'Zulawski', 'tell', 'story.If', 'are', 'accustomed', 'standard', 'horror', 'fare', 'then', 'probably', 'will', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'pretentious', 'eurotrash', 'something', 'been', 'labeled', 'off', 'countless', 'times', ""'re"", 'game', 'follow', 'sequences', 'let', 'imagination', 'be', 'ensnared', 'will', 'be', 'convulsive', 'ride', 'depths', 'emotion', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'emerge', 'same', 'person.And', 'quite', 'possibly', 'what', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'about', 'heart.As', 'footnote', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'won', 'very', 'deserved', 'Gold', 'Palm', 'prestigious', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'dual', 'role', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'hated', 'still', 'unforgettable.The', 'quality', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'also', 'note']",N/A

480695,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6305839980,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 4]","Possession (Andrzej Zulawski, 1981)Roughly halfway through Andrzej Zulawski's criminally underrated Possession, Isabelle Adjani has a long, disjointed, tearful monologue. It is entirely out of place in the weirdness that has grown to envelop the film, and yet it's this very sense of being out of place that makes it brilliant. That's synecdochic of the entire movie, which on some levels is a simple altar to cheese, a response to Kramer vs. Kramer in the same way Harry Bromley Davenport's (similarly-underrated) XTRO is a response to E. T.: The Extraterrestrial. On every other level, however, Zulawski has created something wondrous--a film that is at times almost physically painful to watch, but is the diametric opposite of the unwatchable film. It looks as if, as bad as the average movie was that I watched in January, the average February movie is going to be great; Possession joins Hellzapoppin' and Dance of the Dead so far this month, and all three have been fantastic.Yes, Possession is a monster movie, but don't be fooled; the monster-movie aspect of the film, which is what those few Americans who have ever heard about it know, is nothing more than a tertiary plot device. What this movie is really about, as my comparison in the first paragraph should make obvious, is the disintegration of the marriage of Mark (Sam Neill) and Anna (Isabelle Adjani). The two have a son, Bob (Michael Hogben in his only screen appearance), but unlike the kid in Kramer, who exists mostly as a device to tug the heartstrings of the audience, Bob, too, is kind of tertiary here. The focus is on Neill and Adjani, both in her role as Mark's wife and in her role as Helen, Bob's teacher, to whom Mark is (understandably) attracted after it's revealed that Anna's been going behind his back with Heinrich (Heinz Bennent, perhaps best known to American audiences for Le Dernier Metro), a character who, had he been written more recently, would be considered a kind of new-age Iron John guru. After Mark confronts Heinrich, he finds out that Anna hasn't been going off to see him during her more recent unexplained disappearances, so Mark hires a private detective to find out where she's actually going. The results prove to be surprising, and selectively fatal.In many ways, I found Possession to be far more distressing than most of the horror movies released in the last twenty years. The sense of reality quickly fades a few minutes into the movie, and yet in some ways, it never does. The weirder things get, the more real it all seems. That's not an easy thing to do. As well, the farther into the film we get, the more Neill and Adjani overact, and yet the more it works. I have no idea why this works. I can't explain it. But the more overacting there is, the more powerful the movie gets. Possession is one of those movies that's like a perfect pop song; when you put together all the things that make so many pop songs entirely unlistenable in just the right manner and invest them with enough of... something, it works. Possession is a perfect example of this in the film world, and it is a movie that is not to be missed. Do whatever you must to track a copy down. **** ",5,Brilliant.,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,3180,"['Possession', 'Andrzej', 'Zulawski', '1981', 'Roughly', 'halfway', 'Andrzej', 'Zulawski', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'Possession', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'long', 'disjointed', 'tearful', 'monologue', 'entirely', 'place', 'weirdness', 'grown', 'envelop', 'film', 'yet', 'very', 'sense', 'being', 'place', 'brilliant', 'synecdochic', 'entire', 'movie', 'levels', 'simple', 'altar', 'cheese', 'response', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'same', 'way', 'Harry', 'Bromley', 'Davenport', 'similarly-underrated', 'XTRO', 'response', 'E.', 'T.', 'Extraterrestrial', 'other', 'level', 'however', 'Zulawski', 'created', 'something', 'wondrous', 'film', 'times', 'almost', 'physically', 'painful', 'watch', 'diametric', 'opposite', 'unwatchable', 'film', 'as', 'bad', 'average', 'movie', 'was', 'watched', 'January', 'average', 'February', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'Possession', 'Hellzapoppin', 'Dance', 'Dead', 'so', 'far', 'month', 'three', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic.Yes', 'Possession', 'monster', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'monster-movie', 'aspect', 'film', 'what', 'few', 'Americans', 'who', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'know', 'nothing', 'more', 'tertiary', 'plot', 'device', 'What', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'comparison', 'first', 'paragraph', 'should', 'make', 'obvious', 'disintegration', 'marriage', 'Mark', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Anna', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'two', 'have', 'son', 'Bob', 'Michael', 'Hogben', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'kid', 'Kramer', 'who', 'mostly', 'device', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'audience', 'Bob', 'too', 'kind', 'tertiary', 'here', 'focus', 'Neill', 'Adjani', 'role', 'Mark', 'wife', 'role', 'Helen', 'Bob', 'teacher', 'whom', 'Mark', 'understandably', 'attracted', 'revealed', 'Anna', 'been', 'going', 'back', 'Heinrich', 'Heinz', 'Bennent', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'American', 'audiences', 'Le', 'Dernier', 'Metro', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'more', 'recently', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'kind', 'new-age', 'Iron', 'John', 'guru', 'Mark', 'confronts', 'Heinrich', 'out', 'Anna', ""n't"", 'been', 'going', 'off', 'see', 'more', 'recent', 'unexplained', 'disappearances', 'so', 'Mark', 'private', 'detective', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'actually', 'going', 'results', 'prove', 'be', 'surprising', 'selectively', 'fatal.In', 'many', 'ways', 'found', 'Possession', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'distressing', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'released', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'sense', 'reality', 'quickly', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'yet', 'ways', 'never', 'weirder', 'things', 'get', 'more', 'real', 'not', 'easy', 'thing', 'do', 'As', 'well', 'farther', 'film', 'get', 'more', 'Neill', 'Adjani', 'overact', 'yet', 'more', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'more', 'overacting', 'more', 'powerful', 'movie', 'Possession', 'one', 'movies', 'perfect', 'pop', 'song', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'things', 'make', 'so', 'many', 'pop', 'songs', 'entirely', 'unlistenable', 'just', 'right', 'manner', 'invest', 'enough', 'something', 'Possession', 'perfect', 'example', 'film', 'world', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Do', 'must', 'track', 'copy', 'down', '****']",N/A

Something has happened to these people's lives, something so horrible that it has changed their reality in a way that confuses them yet to which they learn to submit.  It dissolves a marriage between the unbelievably beautiful Isabelle Adjani in her prime and a young Sam Neill, neglecting their child along the way.  Then it leads to murder and an unquestioning complicity between the couple and whatever is happening.As with all truly fascinating works of art, it leaves much unexplained, which the viewer must fill in over a lifetime of wondering.  That is, if this enters your imagination successfully, and that is a very personal predilection.  For me, it is a masterpiece of ambiguity and clues - I will watch it periodically for the rest of my life.  You can listen to what the characters say, even watch the action for a myriad of details to stitch together.I have an interpretation, but do not want to give away details that are not already in the accompanying blurb.  There is the creature, on its way to a transformation.  It has somehow infected the lives of those nearest to it, but it appears to have influence in many other areas that intersect with the principal characters, who pop up inexplicably, such as the green-eyed teacher or the strange lover.  Is it a succubus?  An alien?  Some kind of mutant?  I would think there is something satanic about it, Adjani seems to think so, but she must protect it.  Neill eventually becomes her accomplice, as if there is nothing strange about what they are doing.  At the end, the design - in cold war Berlin - may be apparent.What is undeniable is the spell it weaves.  It is a mix of horror, eroticism, and foreboding.  It is also a delicious puzzle.

Three friends and I talked about it so much we got 4 new friends to watch it with us again. We continued marveling over it and watched it yet again on the third night (ten people this time). Why? Because this isn't really a horror film. Yeah, there's a ""monster"", but only in America would this get relegated to the ""Horror"" genre. Because here, we usually make films to fit in a box, follow a formula or entertain; whereas this one seems to be about catharsis for the director.Several years ago there was an amazing fan site to this man's work (which doesn't seem to exist anymore) that went into infinite detail about his films and personal life. Suffice to say, there's much more going on here than you think.During 1970's and 80's Poland, all films were approved by the Polish film commission and Zulawski's second film ""Diabel"" (1975) was banned. Made in Polish, it was essentially cut off from it's only possible audience. He took a trip to France, made his 3rd film and returned to his homeland to do the 4th. After two years work the authorities would not allow him to finish it. Since then he has lived and created successfully in France.""Possession"" is the first film he made immediately following the second incident in Poland; just as his marriage was dissolving, and is better described as 3 films in 1. The first part is a drama centered around a couple who's marriage is falling apart. As the discord escalates, it becomes a horror film with some scenes potentially taking place only in the psyche of the wife. The finale is an action film that drives the frenzied pace even higher through chase sequences.Other confusions seem to stem from many lines of dialog (especially in exchanges between Hans and Sam Neil) that may be interpreted as critique of Zulawski's treatment by the government of Poland. Consequently some exchanges leave viewers perplexed, as characters words don't appear to have any bearing on the scene at hand. The mysterious ""agents"" that pop up from time to time, simply create the social context the director must've felt as a persecuted artist. And as for the doppelgangers... I like to think they are the plastic versions of each character that the government or society's values would have them become.In many ways this film is an examination of the internal landscape of Zulawski at that moment; divorced from his wife and exiled by his beloved homeland. The high drama of these characters has the actors screamingly portraying every pent-up emotion Zulawski felt about his marriage, and wasn't allowed to say to his fellow countrymen about their homeland. I love this film. I love every gut wrenching, hysterical, chaotic minute of it.

480699,A35LBOT3SMEBRF,6305839980,Wayne,"[6, 7]","I've just watched the Possession DVD and I'm impressed. The film is surreal, strange and absorbing. It was made in 1981 by Polish director  Andrzej Zulawski, and shot in Berlin. It's an enigmatic film that needs  several viewings to connect with it. It is laden with anger, anxiety and  hysteria. It was actually included on the DPP's list of 'Video Nasties' in  the UK in the early eighties.The story involves a man named Mark (Sam  Neill) who arrives home after being away on his mysterious job (possibly a  government secret agent) and is told by his wife Anna (Isabelle Adjani)  that she is having an affair with another man named Heinrich (Heinz  Bennent). The film then goes into a convoluted mode of visceral frenzy.  Isabelle Adjani gives an extremely powerful performance as the crazed wife,  (think of Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant, and then some more) in one scene  in particular in a subway she is irrationally wild.The film is added  more surreal flavour because Adjani plays two characters in the film, the  other being the couple's son's teacher. Heinz Bennent is also in similar  form as the creepy and odd Heinrich, he just looks like Anthony Hopkins as  Hannibal Lectar. Anna leaves Mark and moves into a large vacuous apartment,  where in one of the rooms she has sex with a strange slimy creature, whose  purpose is to evolve and change into a doppelganger of Mark. The ending is  really weird. I don't want to say anything else about the film except watch  it, if you already haven't. If you liked Lost Highway, you'll like  Possession.The DVD is superb. A beautiful dark picture in widescreen  1.66:1 really captures the darkness and unusual camera techniques of  Zulawski. The sound is in mono and is clear. The music is good too. The  extras consist of an excellant and fascinating commentary by director  Andrzej Zulawski, who his questioned by Biographer Dan Bird. Plus, there's  the US and International trailers and some background info about Zulawski.  The menus are good too, with music from the film playing. A Brilliant DVD  transfer of a complex and rewarding film. Essential viewing for fans of  surreal &amp; abstract cinema.",5,Surreal &amp; absorbing,967075200,"08 24, 2000",2000,2162,"[""'ve"", 'just', 'watched', 'Possession', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'film', 'surreal', 'strange', 'absorbing', 'was', 'made', '1981', 'Polish', 'director', 'Andrzej', 'Zulawski', 'shot', 'Berlin', 'enigmatic', 'film', 'several', 'viewings', 'connect', 'laden', 'anger', 'anxiety', 'hysteria', 'was', 'actually', 'included', 'DPP', 'list', ""'Video"", 'Nasties', 'UK', 'early', 'eighties.The', 'story', 'man', 'named', 'Mark', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'who', 'home', 'being', 'away', 'mysterious', 'job', 'possibly', 'government', 'secret', 'agent', 'told', 'wife', 'Anna', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'having', 'affair', 'man', 'named', 'Heinrich', 'Heinz', 'Bennent', 'film', 'then', 'convoluted', 'mode', 'visceral', 'frenzy', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'performance', 'crazed', 'wife', 'think', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'then', 'more', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'subway', 'irrationally', 'wild.The', 'film', 'added', 'more', 'surreal', 'flavour', 'Adjani', 'two', 'characters', 'film', 'other', 'being', 'couple', 'son', 'teacher', 'Heinz', 'Bennent', 'also', 'similar', 'form', 'creepy', 'odd', 'Heinrich', 'just', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Hannibal', 'Lectar', 'Anna', 'Mark', 'large', 'vacuous', 'apartment', 'where', 'one', 'rooms', 'sex', 'strange', 'slimy', 'creature', 'purpose', 'evolve', 'change', 'doppelganger', 'Mark', 'ending', 'really', 'weird', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'watch', 'already', 'have', ""n't"", 'liked', 'Lost', 'Highway', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Possession.The', 'DVD', 'superb', 'beautiful', 'dark', 'picture', 'widescreen', '1.66:1', 'really', 'darkness', 'unusual', 'camera', 'techniques', 'Zulawski', 'sound', 'mono', 'clear', 'music', 'good', 'too', 'extras', 'consist', 'excellant', 'fascinating', 'commentary', 'director', 'Andrzej', 'Zulawski', 'who', 'questioned', 'Biographer', 'Dan', 'Bird', 'US', 'International', 'trailers', 'background', 'info', 'Zulawski', 'menus', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'music', 'film', 'playing', 'Brilliant', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'complex', 'rewarding', 'film', 'Essential', 'viewing', 'fans', 'surreal', 'amp', 'abstract', 'cinema']",N/A
