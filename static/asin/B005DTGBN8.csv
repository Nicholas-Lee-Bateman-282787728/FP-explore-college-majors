1456056,A22U5T9Q0GI5GV,B005DTGBN8,"Bill Bickley ""Brown Dirt Cowboy""","[30, 31]","These are both family oriented Christmas films.  The cable channels run them both every year at Christmas time.  They are both light-hearted films that are fun for every member of the family.  I bought them because I like to watch inspirational movies like these all through the year.  You can't beat the price and I don't believe anyone who loves Christmas would be disappointed by either film.  I whole-heartedly recommend both these films.  Both of my thumbs are up.  CHRISTMAS IN PARADISE is a story of two single-parents vacationing in the Caribbean with their children.  A divorced father with his two daughters and a widowed mother with her two boys.  The children connect and so do the parents, when all of a sudden the father's former wife shows up and wants to get her family back.  It all comes to a happy ending and the two families take off from the hotel together.  DECK THE HALLS, is an extremely touching fantasy.  A widowed mother moves with her adolescent son back to her home and goes to work as CFO for her father's toy company.  Her dad has hired a Christmas specialist named Nick to boost sales.  Turns out that Nick is really Santa Claus and the story has a very happy ending.  Both are wonderful family films.",5,Great Christmas Fun,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,1233,"['are', 'family', 'oriented', 'Christmas', 'films', 'cable', 'channels', 'run', 'year', 'Christmas', 'time', 'are', 'light-hearted', 'films', 'are', 'fun', 'member', 'family', 'bought', 'like', 'watch', 'inspirational', 'movies', 'year', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'price', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'who', 'Christmas', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'whole-heartedly', 'recommend', 'films', 'thumbs', 'are', 'up', 'CHRISTMAS', 'IN', 'PARADISE', 'story', 'two', 'single-parents', 'vacationing', 'Caribbean', 'children', 'divorced', 'father', 'two', 'daughters', 'widowed', 'mother', 'two', 'boys', 'children', 'connect', 'so', 'do', 'parents', 'when', 'sudden', 'father', 'former', 'wife', 'up', 'get', 'family', 'back', 'happy', 'ending', 'two', 'families', 'take', 'off', 'hotel', 'together', 'DECK', 'THE', 'HALLS', 'extremely', 'touching', 'fantasy', 'widowed', 'mother', 'moves', 'adolescent', 'son', 'back', 'home', 'work', 'CFO', 'father', 'toy', 'company', 'dad', 'hired', 'Christmas', 'specialist', 'named', 'Nick', 'boost', 'sales', 'out', 'Nick', 'really', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'story', 'very', 'happy', 'ending', 'are', 'wonderful', 'family', 'films']",Christmas in Paradise / Deck the Halls

Maybe not in my top 20 Christmas movie list but definitely movies I would watch again.In Christmas in Paradise, we meet two families celebrating the Christmas Holiday while taking a cruise into the Caribbean. One family is without a father and the other without a mother. The parental units are missing for different reasons; one has passed away and the other has abandoned the family.Each family is having a difficult time and when they end up befriending each other, the families share a sense of healing and understanding. Eureka's Colin Ferguson and the beautiful Charlotte Ross from Glee are the struggling single parents and they both play their roles very subdued allowing the children to shine. Colin Ferguson spends most of his time making ""I am so ashamed of you"" and ""Please let me help you faces.""  The children actors are talented and I love all the hocky singing and prancing about. I even love the rebellious daughter who is doing anything to show how much she doesn't care and the precocious younger sister who seems to have all the answers. Very cute movie. I love happy endings.Deck the Halls stars Gabrielle Carteris of 90210 fame and a new face for me who is complete eye candy, Steve Bacic.This is about a widowed woman named Holly who moves back to assist her father's toy company with her 8 year old son, Ben.  As the CFO she is trying to wrangle the over spending by her father's favorite employee Nick. Nick has been hired to boost sales and with his swarm of midget friends and reindeer pets, Ben believes he has finally met Santa. After being set up by her son Ben who writes emails to her from a secret admirer, she and Nick get to know each other a little better. As her son gets closer to Nick, she reluctantly asks him to distance himself knowing that Nick will be leaving in December. When Ben's dog is hurt, Nick promises them everything will be OK. Is Nick Santa? Ummm...if so, he is the cutest Santa ever!My only problem with the movie is that while Ben asks Santa for his father back, he is still trying to set up his mom. Umm...strange 8 year old.This is an adorable movie about believing and miracles.",5,Christmas and Lifetime Perfect Together,1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,2237,"['411', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'love', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'are', 'fan', 'Lifetime', 'Movies', 'Maybe', 'not', 'top', '20', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'list', 'definitely', 'movies', 'would', 'watch', 'again.In', 'Christmas', 'Paradise', 'meet', 'two', 'families', 'celebrating', 'Christmas', 'Holiday', 'taking', 'cruise', 'Caribbean', 'One', 'family', 'father', 'other', 'mother', 'parental', 'units', 'are', 'missing', 'different', 'reasons', 'one', 'passed', 'away', 'other', 'abandoned', 'family.Each', 'family', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'when', 'end', 'up', 'befriending', 'other', 'families', 'share', 'sense', 'healing', 'understanding', 'Eureka', 'Colin', 'Ferguson', 'beautiful', 'Charlotte', 'Ross', 'Glee', 'are', 'struggling', 'single', 'parents', 'play', 'roles', 'very', 'subdued', 'allowing', 'children', 'shine', 'Colin', 'Ferguson', 'most', 'time', 'making', 'am', 'so', 'ashamed', 'Please', 'let', 'help', 'children', 'actors', 'are', 'talented', 'love', 'hocky', 'singing', 'prancing', 'even', 'love', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'who', 'doing', 'anything', 'show', 'how', 'much', ""n't"", 'care', 'precocious', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'have', 'answers', 'Very', 'cute', 'movie', 'love', 'happy', 'Halls', 'Gabrielle', 'Carteris', '90210', 'fame', 'new', 'face', 'who', 'complete', 'eye', 'candy', 'Steve', 'Bacic.This', 'widowed', 'woman', 'named', 'Holly', 'who', 'back', 'assist', 'father', 'toy', 'company', '8', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Ben', 'CFO', 'trying', 'wrangle', 'spending', 'father', 'favorite', 'employee', 'Nick', 'Nick', 'been', 'hired', 'boost', 'sales', 'swarm', 'midget', 'friends', 'reindeer', 'pets', 'Ben', 'finally', 'met', 'Santa', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'son', 'Ben', 'who', 'emails', 'secret', 'admirer', 'Nick', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'little', 'better', 'son', 'closer', 'Nick', 'reluctantly', 'distance', 'knowing', 'Nick', 'will', 'be', 'leaving', 'December', 'When', 'Ben', 'dog', 'hurt', 'Nick', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'OK.', 'Is', 'Nick', 'Santa', 'Ummm', 'so', 'cutest', 'Santa', 'ever', 'only', 'problem', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Santa', 'father', 'back', 'still', 'trying', 'set', 'up', 'mom', 'Umm', 'strange', '8', 'year', 'old.This', 'adorable', 'movie', 'believing', 'miracles']",Christmas in Paradise / Deck the Halls
