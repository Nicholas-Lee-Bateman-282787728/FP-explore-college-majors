Mainly about leopards but other deadly animals are thrown into the mix as well IE hyenas, lions, chimps, baboons, crocodiles - all of which are enemies of the leopard.  This makes for an array of action-packed, dangerous, life-threatening encounters.Information/facts about leopards is plentiful.  Inside look on how one particular female leopard lives and survives in the wild with her two cubs.Narrator can sound a bit cheesy at times but not a big deal.Overall an awesome animal documentary, highly recommended 5/5 stars!!",5,Excellent & Emersive Animal Documentary,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,545,"['Very', 'entertaining', 'Mainly', 'leopards', 'other', 'deadly', 'animals', 'are', 'thrown', 'mix', 'as', 'well', 'IE', 'hyenas', 'lions', 'chimps', 'baboons', 'crocodiles', 'are', 'enemies', 'leopard', 'array', 'action-packed', 'dangerous', 'life-threatening', 'encounters.Information/facts', 'leopards', 'plentiful', 'Inside', 'look', 'how', 'one', 'particular', 'female', 'leopard', 'lives', 'survives', 'wild', 'two', 'cubs.Narrator', 'can', 'sound', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'times', 'not', 'big', 'deal.Overall', 'awesome', 'animal', 'documentary', 'highly', 'recommended', '5/5', 'stars']",N/A

It is a good documentary but is only 60 minutes long. It takes more than 60 minutes to reveal, discover, and learn about this very secretive feline.I would still highly recommend Revealing The Leopard, for brief educational purposes. Any footage of leopards is still very entertaining, but the short duration leaves much to be desired. It seems that as soon as you really get into the documentary, the closing credits are already rolling.",5,Revealing The Leopard,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",2011,576,"['Revealing', 'Leopard', 'too', 'short', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'longer', 'not', 'reveal', 'much', 'leopards', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'good', 'documentary', 'only', '60', 'minutes', 'long', 'more', '60', 'minutes', 'reveal', 'discover', 'learn', 'very', 'secretive', 'feline.I', 'would', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Revealing', 'Leopard', 'brief', 'educational', 'purposes', 'footage', 'leopards', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'short', 'duration', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'as', 'soon', 'really', 'get', 'documentary', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'already', 'rolling']",N/A
