700054,A2KFOBB8RXJTSR,B000065U2X,Deborah Mckenzie,"[1, 3]","I enjoyed this movie, as I do most anything Kathy Bates does. The movie is based on a true story of two sisters who are forced to work on their relationship after their mother dies. Kathy Bates plays the bipolar sister who, in the end, seems to have more sense about relationships than her normal, successful sister. It made me think about how the so-called ""normal"" people of the world look at those with mental disorders and other handicaps.",4,Makes you think,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,443,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'do', 'most', 'anything', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'work', 'relationship', 'mother', 'dies', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'bipolar', 'sister', 'who', 'end', 'have', 'more', 'sense', 'relationships', 'normal', 'successful', 'sister', 'made', 'think', 'how', 'so-called', 'normal', 'people', 'world', 'look', 'mental', 'disorders', 'other', 'handicaps']",N/A

The film's portrayl of bipolar disorder is not very accurate in that it is pretty sugar-coated.  However, the support of her well-off business woman sister is quite nice.  It's a Hallmark film, so it follows that it is simple and sweet.  Kathy Bates does a good job.",3,A fair portrayl of mental illness; a nice portrayl of sisterly devotion,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,324,"['One', 'sister', 'mentally', 'ill', 'diagnosed', 'bipolar', 'film', 'portrayl', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'not', 'very', 'accurate', 'pretty', 'sugar-coated', 'However', 'support', 'well-off', 'business', 'woman', 'sister', 'quite', 'nice', 'Hallmark', 'film', 'simple', 'sweet', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'good', 'job']",N/A

Spending most of her life in and out of various institutions, Christine has long yearned for independence, but is unable to wrest free of her controlling mother, Helen. Upon Helen's death, her other daughter, Judy, a successful, self-absorbed art director who has deliberately distanced herself from her family, is appointed trustee of the troubled Christine. The rest of the movie chronicles Judy's frustrated efforts to balance her sister's needs with her own, and Christine's ongoing ambition to stand on her own two feet. This movie does an excellent job of conveying the conflicts that exist among the mentally ill and their families, without beating the viewer over the head with a sentimental sledgehammer, or falling into the all-too-familiar trap of turning mental illness into great melodrama. This movie is very touching and moving. The acting is superb. An excellent movie and a outstanding Hallmark production. This is definitely a must-see movie.",5,My Sister's Keeper,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,1040,"['Christine', 'who', 'childhood', 'suffered', 'debilitating', 'mental', 'illness', 'Spending', 'most', 'life', 'various', 'institutions', 'Christine', 'long', 'yearned', 'independence', 'unable', 'wrest', 'free', 'controlling', 'mother', 'Helen', 'Upon', 'Helen', 'death', 'other', 'daughter', 'Judy', 'successful', 'self-absorbed', 'art', 'director', 'who', 'deliberately', 'distanced', 'family', 'appointed', 'trustee', 'troubled', 'Christine', 'rest', 'movie', 'Judy', 'frustrated', 'efforts', 'balance', 'sister', 'needs', 'own', 'Christine', 'ongoing', 'ambition', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'conveying', 'conflicts', 'exist', 'mentally', 'ill', 'families', 'beating', 'viewer', 'head', 'sentimental', 'sledgehammer', 'falling', 'all-too-familiar', 'trap', 'turning', 'mental', 'illness', 'great', 'melodrama', 'movie', 'very', 'touching', 'moving', 'acting', 'superb', 'excellent', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'Hallmark', 'production', 'definitely', 'must-see', 'movie']",N/A
