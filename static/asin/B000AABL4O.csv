925082,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000AABL4O,Jeffery Mingo,"[4, 25]","This work was informative.  I learned when and how the motorcycle group formed.  I learned that their symbol has a patent.  The cable channel that produced this work is notorious for cheesy reenactments of historical events.  They don't use those here because there is plenty of footage of actual bikers.  I sympathize with their leader's, Sonny Barger's, struggle with throat cancer.  Still, I think his difficulty speaking may help current smokers consider quitting before it's too late.The documentary does say the group never lives up to others' expectations, be it hippies, federal prosecutors, or others.  Still, I am disappointed how the documentary doesn't explain why the group seems to be composed entirely of white males.  They show women as the bikers' girlfriends, but not as members.  Why is there no Hell's Angelettes or does the documentary just ignore them?  The group started in California, one of the country's most diverse states, yet no member seemed to be Black, Latino, Native, or Asian.  When I saw that the group had a Johannesburg chapter, I was especially concerned, because that chapter may have been apartheid era footage.  The film ""Biker Boyz"" is almost all Black.  Are bikers segregated by race and do the Hell's Angels promote that division?  The work never says.  It renders whiteness and maleness as universal in very problematic ways.The work does say Hollywood is fascinated by the group.  However, it doesn't mention that John Goodman played a biker on ""The Simpsons"" and that some Hell's Angels were in the Eurythmics' video ""Thorn in My Side.""",3,Why so homogenous?,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,1583,"['work', 'was', 'informative', 'learned', 'when', 'how', 'motorcycle', 'group', 'formed', 'learned', 'symbol', 'patent', 'cable', 'channel', 'produced', 'work', 'notorious', 'cheesy', 'reenactments', 'historical', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'here', 'plenty', 'footage', 'actual', 'bikers', 'sympathize', 'leader', 'Sonny', 'Barger', 'struggle', 'throat', 'cancer', 'Still', 'think', 'difficulty', 'speaking', 'may', 'help', 'current', 'smokers', 'consider', 'quitting', 'too', 'late.The', 'documentary', 'say', 'group', 'never', 'up', 'others', 'expectations', 'be', 'federal', 'prosecutors', 'others', 'Still', 'am', 'disappointed', 'how', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'group', 'be', 'composed', 'entirely', 'white', 'males', 'show', 'women', 'bikers', 'girlfriends', 'not', 'members', 'Why', 'there', 'Hell', 'Angelettes', 'documentary', 'just', 'ignore', 'group', 'started', 'California', 'one', 'country', 'most', 'diverse', 'states', 'yet', 'member', 'seemed', 'be', 'Black', 'Latino', 'Native', 'Asian', 'When', 'saw', 'group', 'had', 'Johannesburg', 'chapter', 'was', 'especially', 'concerned', 'chapter', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'apartheid', 'era', 'footage', 'film', 'Biker', 'Boyz', 'almost', 'Black', 'Are', 'bikers', 'segregated', 'race', 'do', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'promote', 'division', 'work', 'never', 'whiteness', 'maleness', 'universal', 'very', 'problematic', 'ways.The', 'work', 'say', 'Hollywood', 'fascinated', 'group', 'However', ""n't"", 'mention', 'John', 'Goodman', 'played', 'biker', 'Simpsons', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'were', 'Eurythmics', 'video', 'Thorn', 'My', 'Side']",In Search of History: Hell's Angels
925083,ACOY29IAE58HO,B000AABL4O,Peter Huston,"[10, 12]","I saw this documentary on TV, and have two criticisms.First, the growth and transformation of the Hells Angels from a local motorcycle club to a multi-national organization that spans at least five continents (North America, Europe, (South) Africa, South America and Australia) has an interesting history.This growth was caused in large part by interest in the group overseas sparked by lwo budget films such as ""Wild Angels"" and the whole slew of drive-in quality ""biker flicks"" that lasted from the mid-60s to the mid-70s. (Members of the Hells Angels appeared, usually as extras, in several of these including ""Wild Angels,"" ""Hells Angels on Wheels,"" and ""Hells Angels '69.""It was an odd merging of myth, movies and reality with an increase in one giving a boost to the other two aspects of the group.Second, as someone who collects these (odd) films, I was astonished to see how much of the footage shown in this documentary came from various drive-in biker films.Again we have the odd melding of myth, movie and reality merging in this documentary.Much of the other footage, including interviews, came from the documentary ""Hells Angels Forever,"" a film that was produced by the Angels themselves as a public relations effort.Therefore I felt this documentary gave about half the story and tried to exaggerate what it had in the way of information.Still, it was interesting. I enjoyed it, but I think people who really enjoyed it might enjoy digging deeper as most of the footage came from sources that are already available to the public.",3,Interesting but does not give credit to the movies,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,1544,"['saw', 'documentary', 'TV', 'have', 'two', 'criticisms.First', 'growth', 'transformation', 'Hells', 'Angels', 'local', 'motorcycle', 'club', 'multi-national', 'organization', 'least', 'five', 'continents', 'North', 'America', 'Europe', 'South', 'Africa', 'South', 'America', 'Australia', 'interesting', 'history.This', 'growth', 'was', 'caused', 'large', 'part', 'interest', 'group', 'overseas', 'sparked', 'lwo', 'budget', 'films', 'such', 'Wild', 'Angels', 'whole', 'slew', 'drive-in', 'quality', 'biker', 'flicks', 'lasted', 'mid-60s', 'mid-70s', 'Members', 'Hells', 'Angels', 'appeared', 'usually', 'extras', 'several', 'including', 'Wild', 'Angels', 'Hells', 'Angels', 'Wheels', 'Hells', 'Angels', ""'69"", 'was', 'odd', 'merging', 'myth', 'movies', 'reality', 'increase', 'one', 'giving', 'boost', 'other', 'two', 'aspects', 'group.Second', 'someone', 'who', 'odd', 'films', 'was', 'astonished', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'footage', 'shown', 'documentary', 'came', 'various', 'drive-in', 'biker', 'films.Again', 'have', 'odd', 'melding', 'myth', 'movie', 'reality', 'merging', 'documentary.Much', 'other', 'footage', 'including', 'interviews', 'came', 'documentary', 'Hells', 'Angels', 'Forever', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Angels', 'public', 'relations', 'effort.Therefore', 'felt', 'documentary', 'gave', 'story', 'tried', 'exaggerate', 'what', 'had', 'way', 'information.Still', 'was', 'interesting', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'might', 'enjoy', 'digging', 'deeper', 'most', 'footage', 'came', 'sources', 'are', 'already', 'available', 'public']",In Search of History: Hell's Angels

I liked the interviews and how it explained from beginning to end how the club expanded. I was surprised on how the club grew and expanded into other parts of the world.
