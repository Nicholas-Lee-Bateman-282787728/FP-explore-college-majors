I have always enjoyed Jim Caviezel ability to play anything form J.C in &#34;passion of christ&#34; to a common low life thug. His rival Colm Meany half/man-half/robot, doesnt dissapoint as a creepy psychopath w/a 3 ton Caddillac that has a taste for squashing young women. Not a complicated plot, the usual revenge flick, but it does has its moments.

This was better than expected. Fans of highway movies like ""The Duel"" and ""The Hitchhiker"" should definitely catch it. Although there isn't a great deal of mystery you will find yourself stuck to your seat as you root for Caviezel to stop the mechanical mans rampage of hit and run on innocent pedestrians. Interesting character development and good camera work make this a worthy entry in this genre. A mans wife is ran down on the highway and he tracks the man that did it, and finds out he is a serial killer. His pursuit crosses another beautiful woman and a traffic investigator. Getting their trust won't be easy and may lead to the death of others along the way. Keep in mind this is very hypothetical movie, but not totally outside the realm of possibilities.

833675,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B0002HOEPI,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 2]","""Highwayman"" (2004) is one of those films where an inanimate object takes on a persona. One of the first (and best) of these films was ""Duel"" (1971) a made for TV movie starring a homicidal truck and Dennis Weaver and directed by Steven Spielberg.The film stars a 1972 Cadillac Eldorado and a 1968 modified Plymouth Barracuda with a 426 hemi super stock engine. Colm Feore drives the homicidal green Eldorado and James Caviezel is the avenger in the red Barracuda. Rhona Mirtra plays the damsel in distress and Frankie Faison plays a traffic inspector drawn into the feud.James Caviezel is best known for his portrayal of Jesus in ""The Passion of the Christ"" (2004) or his break through role in ""A Thin Red Line"" (1998) as Private Witt. He plays this one with all the seriousness of his work in ""Passion"", which doesn't feel right under the circumstances.Rhona Mitra is best known for her work on ""The Practice"" (2003-4) and ""Boston Legal"" (2004-5) as Tara Wilson. She alternates between TV series and movie roles, and has appeared in ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" (2009) as Sonja and ""Shooter"" (2007) as Mark Wahlberg's love interest. I really like the work she did in ""Doomsday"" (2008). She does a good job as the endangered, traumatized, yet spunky girl who is being hunted by Feore and his homicidal Caddy. Considering how believably she plays the hardcore in films like ""Underworld"" and ""Doomsday"" it's a real tribute to her acting abilities that she plays the fragile victim in this film.Colm Feore is barely recognizable among the prosthetic devices being used to hold him together. He's best known for his work as Pierre Trudeau in the TV series of the same name, and for his role as the husband of the President in TV's best series, 24 (2009). I liked him best as Lord Marshall from ""Chronicles of Riddick"" (2004).Frankie Faison is the only actor to appear in all 3 Hannibal Lector films with Anthony Hopkins. He played Richard Evans in ""One Life to Live"" (2009-10) and Police Commissioner Burrell on ""The Wire"" (2002-8). Faison does his usual dependable work.The film is directed by Robert Harmon, best known for his 1986 horror flick ""The Hitcher"", which also deals with death on the highway. Since 2005 Harmon has been busy with the Tom Selleck ""Jesse Stone"" series which produces nearly one TV movie per year. He received a DGA and an Emmy nomination for his work on ""Gotti"" (1996) and an Emmy nomination for ""Ike: Countdown to D-Day"" (2004).The film is well directed, has lots of action and thrills, including a memorable multi-vehicle crash in a tunnel that includes a horse roaming free. There are many plot flaws, but you barely have time to process the inconsistencies (e.g., in the final scene, where do the ambulances come from?) before another action scene draws your attention.One of the problems with this film is that it tries to have a foot on both pedals, i.e., it shows us the car and the driver. Far more menace could be produced by hinting at the driver and spending more time on the car. Another problem is the ending. I don't want to spoil it, so suffice it to say that IMHO there were several better ways to end the film.Bottom line - an entertaining action thriller.",3,Eldorado vs. Barracuda,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,3202,"['Highwayman', '2004', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'inanimate', 'object', 'persona', 'One', 'first', 'best', 'films', 'was', 'Duel', '1971', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'starring', 'homicidal', 'truck', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Spielberg.The', 'film', '1972', 'Cadillac', 'Eldorado', '1968', 'modified', 'Plymouth', 'Barracuda', '426', 'hemi', 'super', 'stock', 'engine', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'homicidal', 'green', 'Eldorado', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'avenger', 'red', 'Barracuda', 'Rhona', 'Mirtra', 'damsel', 'distress', 'Frankie', 'Faison', 'traffic', 'inspector', 'drawn', 'feud.James', 'Caviezel', 'best', 'known', 'portrayal', 'Jesus', 'Passion', 'Christ', '2004', 'break', 'role', 'A', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', '1998', 'Private', 'Witt', 'one', 'seriousness', 'work', 'Passion', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'circumstances.Rhona', 'Mitra', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'Practice', '2003-4', 'Boston', 'Legal', '2004-5', 'Tara', 'Wilson', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'roles', 'appeared', 'Underworld', 'Rise', 'Lycans', '2009', 'Sonja', 'Shooter', '2007', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'love', 'interest', 'really', 'work', 'did', 'Doomsday', '2008', 'good', 'job', 'endangered', 'traumatized', 'yet', 'spunky', 'girl', 'who', 'being', 'hunted', 'Feore', 'homicidal', 'Caddy', 'Considering', 'how', 'believably', 'hardcore', 'films', 'Underworld', 'Doomsday', 'real', 'tribute', 'acting', 'abilities', 'fragile', 'victim', 'film.Colm', 'Feore', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'prosthetic', 'devices', 'being', 'used', 'hold', 'together', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'Pierre', 'Trudeau', 'TV', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'role', 'husband', 'President', 'TV', 'best', 'series', '24', '2009', 'liked', 'best', 'Lord', 'Marshall', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', '2004', '.Frankie', 'Faison', 'only', 'actor', 'appear', '3', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'films', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'played', 'Richard', 'Evans', 'One', 'Life', 'Live', '2009-10', 'Police', 'Commissioner', 'Burrell', 'Wire', '2002-8', 'Faison', 'usual', 'dependable', 'work.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Harmon', 'best', 'known', '1986', 'horror', 'flick', 'Hitcher', 'also', 'death', 'highway', '2005', 'Harmon', 'been', 'busy', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'series', 'nearly', 'one', 'TV', 'movie', 'year', 'received', 'DGA', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'work', 'Gotti', '1996', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'Ike', 'Countdown', 'D-Day', '2004', '.The', 'film', 'well', 'directed', 'lots', 'action', 'thrills', 'including', 'memorable', 'multi-vehicle', 'crash', 'tunnel', 'horse', 'roaming', 'free', 'are', 'many', 'plot', 'flaws', 'barely', 'have', 'time', 'process', 'inconsistencies', 'e.g.', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'do', 'ambulances', 'come', 'action', 'scene', 'attention.One', 'problems', 'film', 'have', 'foot', 'pedals', 'i.e.', 'car', 'driver', 'Far', 'more', 'menace', 'could', 'be', 'produced', 'hinting', 'driver', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'car', 'problem', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'so', 'suffice', 'say', 'IMHO', 'were', 'several', 'better', 'ways', 'end', 'film.Bottom', 'line', 'entertaining', 'action', 'thriller']",N/A

The image of the girl on the ground backing away from the car while the car slowly stalked her {see the back of the box for a visual} for those who don't know what I' am talking about. That wasn't the sole reason I wanted to see this film, two other factors played into this. One of which happens to be Robert Harmon, for those who don't know he is the director ""The Hitcher"". The other reason was because Colm Feore played the killer in this film, who is he you might ask. Well he played that devil dude in Stephen King's ""Storm of the Century"", which happens to be one of my favorite films, especially for a TV movie. So to say the least I was excited to see this film, even though it didn't turn out as good as I had hoped.Not that it was bad, because it was entertaining and a pretty good movie; it just wasn't what I expected. After the image I had seen from the trailer and knowing who the director was I expected something as good as ""The Hitcher"". Unfortunately it didn't meet those standards to the fullest. The film in all was good and entertaining, but I didn't really find it suspenseful. A lot of the scenes were kinda predictable but the story made up for it. In fact some scenes were off the hook, like the way he set the two girls up in the beginning where Rhona Mitra got away. Rhona by the way did a decent job in this film, although it still bugs me that she didn't trust Rennie Cray {Jim Caviezel} even after he saved her. And Caviezel did an alright job in this film, he seemed a little one dimensional but that's just me. But he did do a good job with what he was given to play, and he made his character believable. Frankie Faison did a nice job as well on this film with his roll, I love the way his character finally got use a gun in the end of the film. But of course I came here to see Colm Feore, and like I thought he didn't disappoint. He played the roll nicely with a mix of arrogance and evil that made his character shine the most even though we don't see his character as much as the others. In fact that has to be a complaint of mine; we should have seen more of him. Just imagine if his character had been dug deeper into during this film, how great would that have been. That has got to be one of the things that writers Craig Mitchell & Hans Bauer messed up on.Other then that their story is a pretty good one, in fact the idea and concept is brilliant. A guy who has lost all faith in the law after his wife is run down by a serial killer, who kills by way of his car, is let off while he has to spend some time in jail after nearly killing the killer after running into his car with his. The idea is brilliant but director Robert Harmon doesn't pull it off as well as he should have, of course it isn't all his fault the writers did slip with the finished script. Of course the producers as well are to blame, but I should stop blaming people. Because the film isn't bad in fact it is good, it just wasn't as good as it could have been.",3,IT WAS OK,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,3091,"['HIGHWAYMENI', 'still', 'remember', 'when', 'fist', 'had', 'seen', 'trailer', 'film', 'had', 'immediate', 'interest', 'film', 'image', 'girl', 'ground', 'backing', 'away', 'car', 'car', 'slowly', 'stalked', 'see', 'back', 'box', 'visual', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'was', ""n't"", 'sole', 'reason', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'two', 'other', 'factors', 'played', 'One', 'be', 'Robert', 'Harmon', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'director', 'Hitcher', 'other', 'reason', 'was', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'played', 'killer', 'film', 'who', 'might', 'ask', 'Well', 'played', 'devil', 'dude', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Storm', 'Century', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'especially', 'TV', 'movie', 'So', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'film', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'as', 'good', 'had', 'hoped.Not', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'entertaining', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'image', 'had', 'seen', 'trailer', 'knowing', 'who', 'director', 'was', 'expected', 'something', 'as', 'good', 'Hitcher', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'standards', 'fullest', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'entertaining', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'suspenseful', 'lot', 'scenes', 'were', 'kinda', 'predictable', 'story', 'made', 'up', 'fact', 'scenes', 'were', 'hook', 'way', 'set', 'two', 'girls', 'up', 'beginning', 'where', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'got', 'away', 'Rhona', 'way', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'film', 'still', 'bugs', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Rennie', 'Cray', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'even', 'saved', 'Caviezel', 'did', 'alright', 'job', 'film', 'seemed', 'little', 'one', 'dimensional', 'just', 'did', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'play', 'made', 'character', 'believable', 'Frankie', 'Faison', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'roll', 'love', 'way', 'character', 'finally', 'got', 'gun', 'end', 'film', 'course', 'came', 'here', 'see', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'played', 'roll', 'nicely', 'mix', 'arrogance', 'evil', 'made', 'character', 'shine', 'most', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'character', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'fact', 'be', 'complaint', 'mine', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Just', 'imagine', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'dug', 'deeper', 'film', 'how', 'great', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'things', 'writers', 'Craig', 'Mitchell', 'Hans', 'Bauer', 'messed', 'up', 'on.Other', 'then', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'fact', 'idea', 'concept', 'brilliant', 'guy', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'law', 'wife', 'run', 'down', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'way', 'car', 'let', 'off', 'spend', 'time', 'jail', 'nearly', 'killing', 'killer', 'running', 'car', 'idea', 'brilliant', 'director', 'Robert', 'Harmon', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'course', ""n't"", 'fault', 'writers', 'did', 'slip', 'finished', 'script', 'course', 'producers', 'well', 'are', 'blame', 'should', 'stop', 'blaming', 'people', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'fact', 'good', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook""","[0, 3]","This is a ""Road Warrior"" / ""Mad Max"" type film in which James Caviezel plays James 'Rennie' Cray, a newlywed who witnessed the hit-and-run murder of his wife. A pursuit ensues, and Renny is held at fault, when the assailant's vehicle crashes and the attacker is severely disfigured. This all occurs within the first 15 minutes of the film.What transpires next is a cat-and-mouse game between the two main characters spanning several years, as Rennie slowly tracks down his wife's killer. Rennie, who travels the highways nightly in a supped-up Barracuda, constantly monitors the police channels for any bizarre traffic accidents which may lead him to his adversary. Our killer, on the other hand, is intentionally causing accidents and leaving clues for Rennie to follow. The tensions mount as the movie progresses to its crescendo, the final head-to-head battle royal of the film's two motor-crossed stars.The appearance of our antagonist is kept hidden throughout the film until the final battle, and I have to admit seeing him revealed is quite comical; though, I am sure it's unintentional. He resembles the Arnold Schwarzenegger T-100 robot after its had its butt kicked; complete with mechanical hand and foot, and accessorized with a motorized wheelchair.

The story is rather straightforward but has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing while clinging to the edge of your seat.  For an action movie is is up there with the best of them, thanks to smart director Robert Harmon.The film opens somewhere on the plains of America where a beautiful woman is buying fruit from a lonely roadside vendor: her husband Rennie (Jim Caviezel) watches her with adoring eyes from a lonely motel balcony.  But out of the dust of the highway appears a one headlight dirty 1972 Cadillac El Dorado and in seconds Rennie's wife lies dead in the street.Flash forward 5 years and Rennie has given up his life as a doctor, has apparently been hunting down his wife's murderer, discovering that the murderer is a bizarre serial killer named Fargo (Colm Feore), a psychopath who is addicted to killing young women by hit and run and suffers the loss of limbs now replaced with robotic extensions.Rennie knows the MO of Fargo and when another woman becomes a victim of the serial killer, Rennie follows the investigation with a Traffic inspector (Frankie Faison): there were two women in the destroyed car - Alex (Andrea Roth) who is killed and Molly (Rhona Mitra) who survives.  Rennie's drive for revenge creates a bond with Molly and between the two of them the wild car chases and ballistics pummel to the terrifying end of the film.No, the story is not unique, but it has enough of a twist on a plot line to keep suspense afloat.  The photography is on target and the music of Mark Isham (as usual) enhances the tension.  A good movie, not a great movie, but one that is fairly well polished in the terror genre.

833696,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0002HOEPI,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 7]","Robert Harmon's ""The Highwaymen"" is a gripping fast-paced ride that grabs you in the first frames and doesn't let you go until it has rattled your brains 81 minutes later.  As Rennie, Jim Caviezel gives another soulful performance as the haunted husband who watches his wife run down by a hit & run driver and spends years chasing after the guy.  Caviezel's role isn't as demanding or as fulfilling as his performance as Catch in ""Angel Eyes,"" but it is well done.  Colm Feore from ""Chronicles of Riddick,"" ""Paycheck"" & ""Chicago"" is menacing as the handicapped driver whose sole enjoyment in life is terrorizing and killing women with his car.  I watched the film with an occupational therapist who had numerous comments about the portrayal of the handicapped.  Rhona Mitra, who's TV star has shined brightly in ""Party of 5,"" ""Gideon's Crossing,"" ""The Practice"" & now ""Boston Legal,"" does a great job of being pursued, scared and fighting back.  She shows a number of levels, actually more demanding than her appearances in ""The Life of David Gale,"" ""Sweet Home Alabama"" or ""Get Carter.""  Frankie Faison who plays the traffic inspector has 4 films out this year and is a busy character actor (White Chicks, Cookout).  His police detective is a bit slow to pick up the gravity of what's happening and becomes the complication to Rennie's search, but eventually becomes an ally with the final parting shot.

There were some laughable scenes though and some plot holes, but other than that..pretty good. Reminded me Joyride a little bit, but a lot of people are saying it was like The Hitcher (witch was also made by the same director... Robert Harmon).The movie is about a serial killer named Fargo who uses his car to kill people. One day he kills a woman, and the husband, Rennie(James Caviezel), begins his own personal manhunt and chases him down. 5 years go by and the killer doesnt stop. He then kills one girl and tries to kill her friend but fails. But he never fails. So he has to kill this girl named Molly (Rhona Mitra....yum) before he can go somewhere else in the country and continue his spree. Basically it's good guy trying to prevent bad guy from doing it. Which was fun. Fargo knows Rennie is after him and likes to toy with him. He sends him newspaper clippings, pictures, and likes to talk to him on the CB radio. Sometimes the movie is a little  laughable though like when Fargo scoops Molly into his car by using his door..lol..ok..yeah.I think Robert Harmon did a good job directing this movie though. I loved his camera angles (even though sometimes in the tunnel he seemed to have the camera too close). His imagery made me feel like I was in the movie. DVD picture was really crisp and the colors really stood out on my HDTV. Disc was VERY barebones though.

However, this is not a one shot thing----the guy's been doing it for years, and now five years later, he is still at it.  Only this time, he manages to kill one girl but leaves another one alive---and he just has to get rid of her.  He has also been tormenting Caviezel for years, sending him news clippings, letters, etc.Rhona Mitra (Beowulf) co-stars as Molly, the hit and runner's latest attempt.

833709,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0002HOEPI,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 6]","Remember the movie short titled ""The Duel""? It was Steven Spielberg's debut feature in which a salesman suddenly comes face-to-face with an insane truck driver.  The man is sorely tested as the truck driver repeatedly tries to drive him off the road for no discernible reason.  It fed into our everyday fear of big trucks on highways.  Highwaymen is basically Spielberg's mini-masterpiece fleshed out into a full movie.Perhaps that's an overstatement.  Highwaymen is a movie, but ""full"" isn't quite the right term. Contrary to the title, it's not about bandits.  The highwaymen of the title are more akin to knights on horseback, ranging along swaths of territory in their metallic steeds and challenging all who get in their way.  On the good guy side is Rennie Cray (Jim Caviezel) who is out for revenge after bad guy Fargo (Colm Feore) ran over his wife with his 1972 Cadillac Eldorado.  The two have dueled before - Cray rammed Fargo's car in the past, leaving Fargo bereft of most of his limbs.  Cray was imprisoned for three years for his crime.Now they're both back, and a young woman (Rhona Mitra as Molly Poole) is stuck in the middle. She manages to survive one of Fargo's attacks, which makes her enticing bait for the serial killer, for Cray, and for the audience.  Meanwhile, state traffic investigator Willie Macklin (Frankie Faison) tries to track down both men before they kill again.Highwaymen is more style than substance, content to focus on long stretches of open highway, whispy flashbacks of beautiful women in red dresses, and cool car stunts. The plot increasingly tests the audience's willing suspension of disbelief as the film progresses.  Cars function long after they should, people survive crashes who shouldn't, and the drivers perform near-impossible stunts under duress.  But it's fun to watch.The serial killer is really the centerpiece, a modern-day cyborg whose Eldorado is specially modified for his prosthetic limbs. Fargo's condition gives him a weird sci-fi vibe; the movie could almost be a cyperpunk thriller.In a movie like this it's inevitable that there will be a vehicular showdown and Highwaymen doesn't disappoint. The ending's tone is jarring out of sync with the rest of the film.  A disabled man attacked outside of his killer car is just a disabled victim no matter how menacingly he's portrayed.  The twist ending is morally ambiguous, blurring the line between avenger and serial killer. Or it would, if the plot had worked hard to reinforce the importance of holding to one's principals.It doesn't.  Highwaymen is just an action thriller involving two men, their cars, and a girl.  Although it provides plenty of car-on-car (and car-on-girl) action, it's no Duel.",3,Hot car-on-girl action,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,2718,"['Remember', 'movie', 'short', 'titled', 'Duel', 'was', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'debut', 'feature', 'salesman', 'suddenly', 'face-to-face', 'insane', 'truck', 'driver', 'man', 'sorely', 'tested', 'truck', 'driver', 'repeatedly', 'drive', 'off', 'road', 'discernible', 'reason', 'fed', 'everyday', 'fear', 'big', 'trucks', 'highways', 'Highwaymen', 'basically', 'Spielberg', 'mini-masterpiece', 'fleshed', 'out', 'full', 'movie.Perhaps', 'overstatement', 'Highwaymen', 'movie', 'full', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'term', 'Contrary', 'title', 'not', 'bandits', 'highwaymen', 'title', 'are', 'more', 'akin', 'knights', 'horseback', 'ranging', 'swaths', 'territory', 'metallic', 'steeds', 'challenging', 'who', 'get', 'way', 'good', 'guy', 'side', 'Rennie', 'Cray', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'who', 'out', 'revenge', 'bad', 'guy', 'Fargo', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'ran', 'wife', '1972', 'Cadillac', 'Eldorado', 'two', 'have', 'dueled', 'Cray', 'rammed', 'Fargo', 'car', 'past', 'leaving', 'Fargo', 'bereft', 'most', 'limbs', 'Cray', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'three', 'years', 'crime.Now', ""'re"", 'back', 'young', 'woman', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'Molly', 'Poole', 'stuck', 'middle', 'survive', 'one', 'Fargo', 'attacks', 'enticing', 'bait', 'serial', 'killer', 'Cray', 'audience', 'Meanwhile', 'state', 'traffic', 'investigator', 'Willie', 'Macklin', 'Frankie', 'Faison', 'track', 'down', 'men', 'kill', 'again.Highwaymen', 'more', 'style', 'substance', 'content', 'focus', 'long', 'stretches', 'open', 'highway', 'whispy', 'flashbacks', 'beautiful', 'women', 'red', 'dresses', 'cool', 'car', 'stunts', 'plot', 'increasingly', 'audience', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'film', 'Cars', 'function', 'long', 'should', 'people', 'survive', 'crashes', 'who', 'should', ""n't"", 'drivers', 'perform', 'near-impossible', 'stunts', 'duress', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'serial', 'killer', 'really', 'centerpiece', 'modern-day', 'cyborg', 'Eldorado', 'specially', 'modified', 'prosthetic', 'limbs', 'Fargo', 'condition', 'weird', 'sci-fi', 'vibe', 'movie', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'cyperpunk', 'thriller.In', 'movie', 'inevitable', 'will', 'be', 'vehicular', 'showdown', 'Highwaymen', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'ending', 'tone', 'jarring', 'sync', 'rest', 'film', 'disabled', 'man', 'attacked', 'killer', 'car', 'just', 'disabled', 'victim', 'matter', 'how', 'menacingly', 'portrayed', 'twist', 'ending', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'blurring', 'line', 'avenger', 'serial', 'killer', 'would', 'plot', 'had', 'worked', 'hard', 'reinforce', 'importance', 'holding', 'one', 'principals.It', ""n't"", 'Highwaymen', 'just', 'action', 'thriller', 'involving', 'two', 'men', 'cars', 'girl', 'plenty', 'car-on-car', 'car-on-girl', 'action', 'Duel']",N/A

833726,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0002HOEPI,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 7]","""Highwaymen"" is like a serial killer version of ""Duel,"" featuring an anonymous driver who uses his 1968 Cadillac El Dorado to run down his hapless victims - most of whom happen to be beautiful young women, of course - bringing a new meaning to the term ""vehicular manslaughter.""James Caviezel plays Rennie Cray, a man whose wife the killer brutally ran over and left for dead a few years back.  Since the police have proven to be thoroughly inept and ineffectual at bringing the murderer to justice, Cray has chosen to go outside the system to seek his revenge.  As a result, he and the killer engage in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse, with Cray tailing the psycho as he systematically goes about his business of running over more and more innocent women.  Rhona Mitra co-stars as the attractive young lady who is, apparently, next on the hit list and whom Cray uses as bait to ensnare his prey.Except for the fact that the modus operandi is somewhat unique in this film, ""Highwaymen"" has very little to distinguish it from countless other serial killer thrillers that have come before it.  In addition to all the blood and carnage that routinely bespatter such films, ""Highwaymen"" employs the wheezy device of having the killer, in typically portentous tones, constantly tweaking the hero over the CB radio.  Caviziel, who, of course, starred as Jesus in ""The Passion of the Christ,"" in some ways gets to repeat the role of savior yet again in this film, only this time he at least manages to get the better of his tormentor.  Mitra makes an attractive heroine/victim, but neither she nor Caveziel are given much to work with here.Cart it off to the junkyard.",2,junkyard thriller,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,1660,"['Highwaymen', 'serial', 'killer', 'version', 'Duel', 'featuring', 'anonymous', 'driver', 'who', '1968', 'Cadillac', 'El', 'Dorado', 'run', 'down', 'hapless', 'victims', 'most', 'whom', 'happen', 'be', 'beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'course', 'bringing', 'new', 'meaning', 'term', 'vehicular', 'manslaughter', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'Rennie', 'Cray', 'man', 'wife', 'killer', 'brutally', 'ran', 'left', 'dead', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'police', 'have', 'proven', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'inept', 'ineffectual', 'bringing', 'murderer', 'justice', 'Cray', 'chosen', 'go', 'system', 'seek', 'revenge', 'result', 'killer', 'engage', 'deadly', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'Cray', 'tailing', 'psycho', 'systematically', 'business', 'running', 'more', 'more', 'innocent', 'women', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'co-stars', 'attractive', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'apparently', 'next', 'hit', 'list', 'whom', 'Cray', 'as', 'bait', 'ensnare', 'prey.Except', 'fact', 'modus', 'operandi', 'somewhat', 'unique', 'film', 'Highwaymen', 'very', 'little', 'distinguish', 'countless', 'other', 'serial', 'killer', 'thrillers', 'have', 'come', 'addition', 'blood', 'carnage', 'routinely', 'bespatter', 'such', 'films', 'Highwaymen', 'wheezy', 'device', 'having', 'killer', 'typically', 'portentous', 'tones', 'constantly', 'tweaking', 'hero', 'CB', 'radio', 'Caviziel', 'who', 'course', 'starred', 'Jesus', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'ways', 'repeat', 'role', 'savior', 'yet', 'again', 'film', 'only', 'time', 'least', 'manages', 'get', 'better', 'tormentor', 'Mitra', 'attractive', 'heroine/victim', 'Caveziel', 'are', 'given', 'much', 'work', 'here.Cart', 'junkyard']",N/A

enough i did.i have no idea why this film slipped under the radar.its kinda like a comic book-ish type premise.where theres this driven man trying to hunt down the guy who ranned down his wife on a desert freeway.the guy is completley obsessive about it,kinda like the punisher,or batman.the guy has a suped up cuda,with multiple cb's and transister radios.trying to track down the guy responsible for his wifes death (and countless others for that matter).the guy whom killed his wife is responsible for many more hit and runs,he makes them seem like accidents,so theres no real further investigations into the murder.it all started right after the protagonists wife was ranned down like a dog.our hero gets into a car and chaces him down till he hits him.the antagonists suffers from severe injuries as a result.the killer gets off cause he claims he didin't see the protagonists wife (but we all know thats not true.)so caveziels charachter gets 2 or 3 years for his assault against the antagonist.but of course the antagonist wants revenge now aswell considering the condition he's now in.so now his el derado is the exstention of his body now.with cranks and gears that help him drive the car sense his limbs are horribly dissfigured(you'll see it later in the movie how badly mangled his body is).so after caviziel gets out of jail he rigs up his cuda aswell and goes after the murderer.so this cat and mouse game continues for a few years while they taunt each other threw cb radios..........untill caviziel gets a edge in the situation.caviezel basicly follows a survivor from the killers last killing spree (in wich her friend had died) to a crash survivors meetings.he tells her what he knows about the accident and tell her that if he can find her so can the killer.he insists the killer would be after her again to finish the job.he offers her a ride home she turns it down.instead she rides home with her friend when the killer in the el derado shows up but caviziel is there to save her.he hold the survivor of the antagonist hostage as a barganing tool to get close to the killer.because he knows if he doesn't get him now he would have to wait another 4 years.as the killer dissapears for several years at a time.the hostage is exstremley against the idea (you would be too considering what she been through).she survived a fatale car crashed that killed her parents when she was younger.so as a result thats why she refuses to drive now,and add to the fact she just lost her last to friends to the highway killer.of course cavieziel tells her the WHOLE story about his long standing highway fued with the killer.it does'nt make her anymore willing to commit to his dangerous plan though.watch the movie to see how all this unfolds in the end.all in all this

Fargo (Colm Feore) was an insurance salesman, until he became deranged and started running over women with his car.  After his wife was struck down before his eyes, by Fargo's speeding Cadillac El Dorado, Rennie Cray (Jim Caviezel) jumps into his Mercedes and chases down the killer, plowing into him with his car.  The crash leaves Fargo severely injured, with prosthetic limbs, and in a wheelchair.  For his actions, Cray is sentenced to three years in prison.Patched up and back behind the wheel, Fargo still has a thirst for blood.  He fails in his attempt to kill Molly Poole (Rhona Mitra), his next intended target, killing her friend instead.  Out of prison, and on Fargo's trail in a customized red 1968 Barracuda, Cray rescues Molly, and convinces her that confronting Fargo, is her best chance for survival.The action is almost entirely vehicular, and features some competently executed action sequences, the most exciting involves the dragging of an overturned car.  The mysterious Fargo is rarely on camera, and insight into his personality comes mostly via CB radio conversations with Cray.  Rhona Mitra who may be more well-known for playing tough women, in films like Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009), and Doomsday (2008) , is softly venerable here.  The usually subdued Cavizel, gives another low key performance.  Will Macklin (Frankie Faison) is a police traffic investigator also on the case, who uses his weapon for the first time in his career.You may not develop a strong emotional connection to the characters, but the vehicular mayhem could be enough to hold your interest for 80 minutes.

833744,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002HOEPI,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 6]","Robert Harmon is famous for his chilling thriller 'Hitcher' which starred Rutger Hauer.  Now he takes up a similar theme, a car action film that deals with roadside serial killing,  featuring Jim Caviesel (or James, if you remember his role as Jesus Christ in Mel Gibson's film), Rhona Mitra ('Life of David Gale'), Frankie Falson, Colm Feore, Gordon Currie, and Andrea Roth.  The music is by Mark Isham, and moody photography by Rene Ohashi.The story is noting new: Jim plays Rennie, whose wife got killed in a violent hit-and-run case by a green-colored Cadillac (and that's before his eye).  Five years later, he is seeking for the guy responsible for the killing.  It is no accident, for he knows, and he gets a clue while listening to CB radio.  For, again, he knows, the murderer would come back.Driving a powered-up red Barracuda, the man chases the killer's Cadillac, which showed up at a tunnel (which reminds us of one sad accident of Princess Di).  You see there a terrible accident of piled-up cars -- the only difference is that one of the cars didn't try to avoid the accident.  And only one survives -- a woman named Molly (Mitra).Interesting opening it is, I admit.  (And company New Line Cinema once hit the paydirt with 'Se7en' if you remeber.)  But the story needs more than that -- I mean, its average revenge story and car crashes.  Actually, the backstory of the hero or the heroine is too sketchy for make us relate to them, and the film loses its steam half on the way because of the lack of the characters' motives (except for Rennie).Why does this maniac driver keep on killing?  Before you know the answer, the driver himself (who should have hidden his face) betrays his identity too early, depriving the story of one big interest on our side.  Moreover, the inconsistent behavior of car accident investgator Macklin (Falson) does not help at all when he first shows considerable knowledge about the cars, then throwing away all these intelligence, and takes up a gun (without any backups) and joins in the reckless car chase.  It's a bad sign of B-action film.Still, there are good things about the film which are its good action stunts and creepy photography.  Especially the latter works well to create the deserted feelings of the countryside of America, where no one would save you if you stuck on the road.  Still, I couldn't shake off the impression that I have seen a better version of this car action with a deadly driver, and that's of course Spielberg's 'Duel.'",2,Car Action with Serial Killer Theme: Good Stunts Weak Script,1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,2500,"['Robert', 'Harmon', 'famous', 'chilling', 'thriller', ""'Hitcher"", 'starred', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Now', 'up', 'similar', 'theme', 'car', 'action', 'film', 'deals', 'roadside', 'serial', 'killing', 'featuring', 'Jim', 'Caviesel', 'James', 'remember', 'role', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'film', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', ""'Life"", 'David', 'Gale', 'Frankie', 'Falson', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'Gordon', 'Currie', 'Andrea', 'Roth', 'music', 'Mark', 'Isham', 'moody', 'photography', 'Rene', 'Ohashi.The', 'story', 'noting', 'new', 'Jim', 'Rennie', 'wife', 'got', 'killed', 'violent', 'hit-and-run', 'case', 'green-colored', 'Cadillac', 'eye', 'Five', 'years', 'later', 'seeking', 'guy', 'responsible', 'killing', 'accident', 'clue', 'listening', 'CB', 'radio', 'again', 'murderer', 'would', 'come', 'back.Driving', 'powered-up', 'red', 'Barracuda', 'man', 'killer', 'Cadillac', 'showed', 'up', 'tunnel', 'one', 'sad', 'accident', 'Princess', 'Di', 'see', 'there', 'terrible', 'accident', 'piled-up', 'cars', 'only', 'difference', 'one', 'cars', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'avoid', 'accident', 'only', 'one', 'woman', 'named', 'Molly', 'Mitra', '.Interesting', 'opening', 'admit', 'company', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'once', 'hit', 'paydirt', ""'Se7en"", 'remeber', 'story', 'more', 'mean', 'average', 'revenge', 'story', 'car', 'crashes', 'Actually', 'backstory', 'hero', 'heroine', 'too', 'sketchy', 'make', 'relate', 'film', 'steam', 'half', 'way', 'lack', 'characters', 'motives', 'Rennie', '.Why', 'maniac', 'driver', 'keep', 'killing', 'know', 'answer', 'driver', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'hidden', 'face', 'identity', 'too', 'early', 'depriving', 'story', 'one', 'big', 'interest', 'side', 'Moreover', 'inconsistent', 'behavior', 'car', 'accident', 'investgator', 'Macklin', 'Falson', 'not', 'help', 'when', 'first', 'considerable', 'knowledge', 'cars', 'then', 'throwing', 'away', 'intelligence', 'up', 'gun', 'backups', 'reckless', 'car', 'chase', 'bad', 'sign', 'B-action', 'film.Still', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'good', 'action', 'stunts', 'creepy', 'photography', 'Especially', 'latter', 'well', 'create', 'deserted', 'feelings', 'countryside', 'America', 'where', 'one', 'would', 'save', 'stuck', 'road', 'Still', 'could', ""n't"", 'shake', 'off', 'impression', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'version', 'car', 'action', 'deadly', 'driver', 'course', 'Spielberg', ""'Duel""]",N/A
