When I heard the theme music I knew this was the program I used to watch.  So far so good.  I don't mind the quality being less than perfect, that just adds character to the dvds.  Just play them w/the volume lower than usual & that will alleviate most of the static.  They'll be a few vertical lines here & there but not enough to distract you from watching these gems.  I'm really enjoying these.",5,ONE STEP  BEYOND  vol 1-12,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,504,"['back', 'memories', 'even', 'was', 'child', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'back', '60s', 'When', 'heard', 'theme', 'music', 'knew', 'was', 'program', 'used', 'watch', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'quality', 'being', 'less', 'perfect', 'just', 'character', 'dvds', 'Just', 'play', 'w/the', 'volume', 'lower', 'usual', 'will', 'alleviate', 'most', 'static', ""'ll"", 'be', 'few', 'vertical', 'lines', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'enough', 'distract', 'watching', 'gems', ""'m"", 'really', 'enjoying']",N/A
