A man site before a campfire, then fires a shot at a bird. A man rides a horse leading three horses. He stops to watch a traveling show camped on the plains. [This is like padding.] A young woman on a horse does trick riding. They the performers promote a patent medicine. [Can they do enough business to support that cast?] That rider says his wife has died, the child too. His son suffers from an illness, his mind is gone. He offers three horses for the man's daughter. The horses are inspected. Later we see a young man in the night. Native Americans visit him. [This is incomprehensible to me.]In the morning that young woman is abducted. They show a canal as if this means something. [This scene is phone, horses did not like camels because of their smell and appearance.] A new audience shows up, three men throw rocks at the entertainers. [They should blame the movie's producers. Staging scenes on a prairie keeps costs down as needed for a low budget production.] There is talk about suicide. ""Do it!"" Two shots end this scene. The movie runs on. The dark scenes say ""low budget"", no need for expensive sets (as if they knew it would be a flop). The young woman makes a deal.By this time I decided I had enough.

So it comes as no surprise that his two feature films--also, &quot;Far North&quot;--have a distinctly theatrical tone.  General audiences may not have a taste for this, but Shepard's films do reward additional viewings, and both have grown on me in a big way.&quot;Silent Tongue&quot; is a ghost story which uncovers a disturbing sickness at the heart of the Old West.  River Phoenix becomes mentally unhinged when his Native American bride dies in childbirth.  This sends his father, Richard Harris, on a journey to try and find another woman for his son.  Exhibiting tragically limited imagination, the father returns to the traveling circus where he traded horses for the first woman, and he attempt a second bargain for the woman's sister.  In the end, the sister must confront the dead woman's ghost, and we learn the dark secret of their past.Phoenix is eerily convincing as the mad Talbot Roe, and Richard Harris is uncharacteristic low-key as the world-weary Prescott Roe.  My only complaint is Dermot Mulroney who is miscast and unable to make his character's diction convincing.",5,Phenomenal ghost story.

People in the U.S., for instance, who want to see Sam Shepard's 1994 film 'Silent Tongue' will have to watch this bottom-of-the-barrel, pan-and-scan frisbee thrown out by Lions Gate.

548589,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00004RF7H,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","A young man (River Phoenix) is grief-stricken by the death of his Indian wife. So much so that he guards over her corpse in the middle of the desert, with nothing but a rifle and his sanity. His father (Richard Harris) decides that in order to save his son, he must bring along the dead wife's sister and have them marry.This was Phoenix's last film before his untimely death, and even though this Western drama doesn't really hold up today, it still has some nice qualities attached to it. First off, Silent Tongue does have a mystical, almost hypnotic look. It's filled with beautiful shots of the silent wasteland surrounding the characters. I was captivated by how the desert looked in the film. Plus, there was also some lovely divine music, that adds to the ambiance of the film's atmosphere (even if it does have that relatively corny 80's sound). The dialogue is very well-written, and its apparent simplicity seems appropriate for a quiet period Western such as this one. Unfortunately, there could have been improvements made for the plot, which is slightly convoluted and just downright strange. It's sometimes hard to follow, especially in the second half of the film when the spirit of the dead Indian wife becomes a major importance. I guess the screenplay is to blame, because it isn't very strong. There are so many questions that are unanswered. I know it's up for the viewer to decided what just happened (and what WILL happen), but the creators of this film seemed to have succeeded a bit too well. And Alan Bates.....well, let's just say that his performance is over-the-top. He's sometimes hard to understand due to his thick Irish accent, and his personality sometimes confuses the overall tone of the rest of the film.Still, Silent Tongue is a good-looking Western, with a very hypnotic feeling attached to it. If you're looking for wall-to-wall action, then you better look somewhere else. This Western relies on dialogue, drama, and mysticism. There are good performances all-around, especially Phoenix and Harris, and the music is very nice. I just wish that the story itself would have been done better than what's here on the finished product.Grade: C+",3,"Quiet, hypnotic, and sometimes confusing",1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,2180,"['young', 'man', 'River', 'Phoenix', 'grief-stricken', 'death', 'Indian', 'wife', 'So', 'much', 'corpse', 'middle', 'desert', 'nothing', 'rifle', 'sanity', 'father', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'order', 'save', 'son', 'must', 'bring', 'along', 'dead', 'wife', 'sister', 'have', 'marry.This', 'was', 'Phoenix', 'last', 'film', 'untimely', 'death', 'even', 'Western', 'drama', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'up', 'today', 'still', 'nice', 'qualities', 'attached', 'First', 'Silent', 'Tongue', 'have', 'mystical', 'almost', 'hypnotic', 'look', 'filled', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'silent', 'wasteland', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'was', 'captivated', 'how', 'desert', 'looked', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'lovely', 'divine', 'music', 'ambiance', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'even', 'have', 'relatively', '80', 'sound', 'dialogue', 'very', 'well-written', 'apparent', 'simplicity', 'appropriate', 'quiet', 'period', 'Western', 'such', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improvements', 'made', 'plot', 'slightly', 'convoluted', 'just', 'downright', 'strange', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'follow', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'when', 'spirit', 'dead', 'Indian', 'wife', 'major', 'importance', 'guess', 'screenplay', 'blame', ""n't"", 'very', 'strong', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'are', 'unanswered', 'know', 'up', 'viewer', 'decided', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'what', 'WILL', 'happen', 'creators', 'film', 'seemed', 'have', 'succeeded', 'bit', 'too', 'well', 'Alan', 'Bates', '..well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'performance', 'over-the-top', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'understand', 'due', 'thick', 'Irish', 'accent', 'personality', 'sometimes', 'overall', 'tone', 'rest', 'film.Still', 'Silent', 'Tongue', 'good-looking', 'Western', 'very', 'hypnotic', 'feeling', 'attached', ""'re"", 'looking', 'wall-to-wall', 'action', 'then', 'better', 'look', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Western', 'relies', 'dialogue', 'drama', 'mysticism', 'are', 'good', 'performances', 'all-around', 'especially', 'Phoenix', 'Harris', 'music', 'very', 'nice', 'just', 'wish', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'what', 'here', 'finished', 'product.Grade', 'C+']",N/A

In Silent Tongue he's the patriarch of a family so dysfunctional that he has to buy wives for his son, played by River Phoenix (the first wife dies and the second one, sister of the first wife, proves uncooperative.) Unfortunately for Harris' character (a horse trader), his dealings are with the owner of a traveling circus/medicine show, played by Alan Bates. His family proves even more dysfunctional, complete with a jealous half brother of the 2 wives.If that were not enough drama, it seems that dead wife number one won't stay dead as she haunts anyone who trespasses on her terrain.
