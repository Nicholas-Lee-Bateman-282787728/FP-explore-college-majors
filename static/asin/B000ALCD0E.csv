927539,A21BJRAY0I5WM9,B000ALCD0E,Eden Russell,"[61, 63]","When I purchased the DVD I expected it to be a little different. It has its ups and downs. It's a nice DVD for a complete beginner but it's still lacking in some ways.PROS of DVD / What to expect from it:1. Neon teaches some basic moves, her instructions are clear and you can actually see her muscles working (she's very muscular).2. There are traectories and pointers, a wonderful way to learn the concept of the moves.3. Everything could be seen very well.4. Neon is a very graceful dancer and she's very fluid in an inspiring kind of way.5. A great extract from Neon's performance DVD Stellar Body.CONS of this DVD / what NOT to expect from it:1. Title is misleading. It will NOT make you instantly a bellydancer. It shows you a bunch of moves to try out on your own and an idea how they are done gracefully but that's it. It does not give you a sense of completion (it didn't happen with me anyways). There is no choreography included, just a couple of combinations which are nice but far away from qualifying you as a bellydancer.2. It lacks a certain inspiring atmosphere; I saw other people complained about too. Neon's clothes are very close to the body and you can see every contraction or twist. However, I can understand how that could be a disappointment to anyone who expects hip scarves, fanning skirts or harem pants. The music background she uses is in a matching rhythm but I would have prefered more Mid-Eastern tunes. In other words, the setting lacks some authentic quality to it.3. There is no warmup at all. I would expect that a complete novice at bellydancing should be given a few suggestions how to prepare for dancing. (I don't care for those long head-tilting-toe-lifting types of warmup but a few words would have been nice).4. I haven't bought DVD lvl 2 and I'm sure more's shown there but I was stunned to see that Neon would teach full body undulations but nothing about hip drops/ hip bumps! In other words, what she teaches is thematically correct the way it's organized but probably not sequence-correct.If you enjoy dancing or want to learn to master a few moves at home, this would be a wonderful DVD for your collection. However, if you have lasting interest in learning bellydance, be prepared to spend more money on another set of instructions as well. When I ordered DVD I ordered in addition The Heartbeat of Bellydance, also available on amazon.com. It turned out to be a very good idea even though there is a gap in the levels taught. Only one DVD would have never been sufficient.",4,Contradictory,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,2526,"['When', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'expected', 'be', 'little', 'different', 'ups', 'downs', 'nice', 'DVD', 'complete', 'beginner', 'still', 'lacking', 'ways.PROS', 'DVD', '/', 'What', 'expect', 'it:1', 'Neon', 'basic', 'moves', 'instructions', 'are', 'clear', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'muscles', 'working', 'very', 'muscular', '.2', 'are', 'traectories', 'pointers', 'wonderful', 'way', 'learn', 'concept', 'moves.3', 'Everything', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'very', 'well.4', 'Neon', 'very', 'graceful', 'dancer', 'very', 'fluid', 'inspiring', 'kind', 'way.5', 'great', 'extract', 'Neon', 'performance', 'DVD', 'Stellar', 'Body.CONS', 'DVD', '/', 'what', 'NOT', 'expect', 'it:1', 'Title', 'misleading', 'will', 'NOT', 'make', 'instantly', 'bellydancer', 'bunch', 'moves', 'try', 'out', 'own', 'idea', 'how', 'are', 'done', 'gracefully', 'not', 'give', 'sense', 'completion', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'anyways', 'choreography', 'included', 'just', 'couple', 'combinations', 'are', 'nice', 'far', 'away', 'qualifying', 'bellydancer.2', 'certain', 'inspiring', 'atmosphere', 'saw', 'other', 'people', 'complained', 'too', 'Neon', 'clothes', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'body', 'can', 'see', 'contraction', 'twist', 'However', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'disappointment', 'anyone', 'who', 'hip', 'scarves', 'fanning', 'skirts', 'harem', 'pants', 'music', 'background', 'matching', 'rhythm', 'would', 'have', 'prefered', 'more', 'Mid-Eastern', 'tunes', 'other', 'words', 'setting', 'authentic', 'quality', 'it.3', 'warmup', 'would', 'expect', 'complete', 'novice', 'bellydancing', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'few', 'suggestions', 'how', 'prepare', 'dancing', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'long', 'head-tilting-toe-lifting', 'types', 'warmup', 'few', 'words', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', '.4', 'have', ""n't"", 'bought', 'DVD', '2', ""'m"", 'sure', 'more', 'shown', 'there', 'was', 'stunned', 'see', 'Neon', 'would', 'teach', 'full', 'body', 'undulations', 'nothing', 'hip', 'drops/', 'hip', 'bumps', 'other', 'words', 'what', 'thematically', 'correct', 'way', 'organized', 'probably', 'not', 'sequence-correct.If', 'enjoy', 'dancing', 'want', 'learn', 'master', 'few', 'moves', 'home', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'collection', 'However', 'have', 'lasting', 'interest', 'learning', 'bellydance', 'be', 'prepared', 'spend', 'more', 'money', 'set', 'instructions', 'well', 'When', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'ordered', 'addition', 'Heartbeat', 'Bellydance', 'also', 'available', 'amazon.com', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'even', 'gap', 'levels', 'taught', 'Only', 'one', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'sufficient']",N/A

927544,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B000ALCD0E,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[8, 8]","Neon is one of the must fluid belly dancers I've seen & she can even do moves with that fluidity with candles on her head ( can see that in her performance in the bonus section)The production quality is very professional.. the background now has some photos instead of stark black. The music is techno which I still don't like & agree with others Eastern would have been better. There is no warm-up of any kind, but she suggest them for harder moves such as back bends, head rolls, etc.Her teaching is very detailed & great info, more the most of the 30 belly dance dvds I've seen. She starts out verryy slow with info, speeds it up to normal, sometimes adds finesse such as bouncing to a hip circle, then layers/adds moves on top such as adding a chest circle to a hip circle, then you practice with music for a min with what you learned. After several moves there is a review w/music for 6 chapters that contain several moves each. With all the layering & trying to get yourself as fluid & comfortable with the moves as Neon is would take a long time.For those who are not as coordinated & get frustrated easily & want dvds with more repetition & workout feeling between moves, I would suggest Neena & Veena the bellydance twins first, Amira Mor's bellydance for fitness or cardio, Bellydance Romance, etc. & use this as a way to perfect skills learned there.There is also 2 practices 1 is 60 min which is all the reviews put together is you don't want to do the slow mo w/o music & want to keep your heart rate up & another for 11 min.The only thing I wish is music all the time when teaching, even light & not a black background...
