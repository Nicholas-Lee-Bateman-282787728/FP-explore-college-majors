503001,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00000IC9S,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","This film begins on a highway at night. A driver on a cell phone strays over the divider line and there is a head-on collision. Architect Kemp is in a hospital bed and interviewed by police detective Charlie. The other driver died at the scene. Kemp undergoes rehabilitation - his neck was broken. These scenes are educational. Kemp will return to his home and await a cure for a full recovery. His ex-wife Lila visits him. Kemp returns home with a private attendant. The police detective returns to tell Kemp the other driver was at fault. Kemp watches the occupants of the building across the courtyard. [Don't they own drapes or just don't care?] Why doesn't Kemp watch cable TV for vicarious thrills? Like the earlier version, you need to interpret the actions of the people. Its like a modern silent film. Couldn't that couple just go on the ""Jerry"" show to resolve their differences?Kemp installed cameras to watch his neighbors. [Isn't that illegal?] Then he hears a woman's screams in the night, followed by stillness. Dogs bark in the night. Did something happen? Kemp notices the absence of the battered wife. The police detective shows up and tells them Kemp's allegation lacks corroboration; the known facts say his wife left on a visit to her sister. Later the wife returns - but is there a difference? Claudia does her detective work, but a page reveals her snooping. Will something happen to reveal Kemp's spying? Will Thorpe threaten Kemp? Will somebody's plan go awry? [What about fingerprints or DNA evidence?] Will help arrive just in time for a happy ending? Can murder be proven without a body? {Yes, but not in this case.] Did the police overlook something?This is a modern version of Hitchcock's famous 1954 film. I think it is a good film, but the original seemed better because of a richer story and cast. The film cleverly used the condition of Christopher Reeve. [Always wear a seat belt!] There seems to be a flaw in this film. Concrete is porous, a body encased in concrete should emit the odor of putrefaction. But maybe nobody noticed this in this Village?

Christopher Reeve is excellent in the part that James Stewart played in the original Alfred Hitchock classic. I have the vast majority of Hictchock movies on DVD.

Using a  real paraplegic instead of a pretend set of broken legs made it more realistic to me. Anyone that insist on watching only original versions is blinding themselves to excellent entertainment. I have seen my share of dud remakes, but this isn't one of them. I highly recommend anyone that likes thrillers to give it a chance. Another remake I recommend is ""12 Angry Men"" with William Petersen. Let's hope they release this version of ""Rear Window"" on DVD.

The villain here is a lot scarier than in Hitchcock's version.  That chilling shot when the guy finally looks across the way to see Reeve staring at him is much more heart-pounding in this version.2. Christopher Reeves's is a much more convincing character than that of Stewart's.3. The scene in which the villain confronts the Peeping Tom is much more intense in this version.4.  Reeve's relationship with the woman rings much truer; in Hitchcock's version I kept wondering what a dish like Grace Kelly's character would be doing wasting her time with Stewart's aging character.5.  The ending in the remake is much more ambiguous; one gets the palpable feel that, even after their suspicions were roundly dashed, there is an nefarious element hanging in the air, only facets of which can ever be known.

It makes the voyeur in this case practically justified since there is no other way but hear and see. But that's too easy. It takes a lot of the secrecy of this voyeuristic knowledge out of the story. The suspense itself is even in many ways reduced, crippled. From a dark and frightening film we shift in this remake to a plain action film with a cripple as the main character who is beautifully rendered by Christopher Reeve, but that is not enough to make a great film.

Being a fan of his since the Superman movies, I so excited to watch this movie! I found it very heart-warming and touching a story about Jason Kemp who is a qudriplegic! Reeve invested most of his experiences into this role which was indeed very tailor-made for him, and the result is good chemistry between him and Hannah! I could understand why many did not like this movie because it wasn't like the original, but since I've never seen the original, I really couln't passjudgement!

503021,A1EB3EO0NZ1LO,B00000IC9S,The Movie Critic,"[2, 3]","So many films have been remade in recent years, and I'm always fascinated as to why. The only justifiable reason that I can see for remaking a film, is if the original had potential, but was in the hands of the wrong director. In the case of 'Rear Window', Alfred Hitchcock's original version was close to perfection. That being the case, why did anyone feel a need to remake it?While sticking to the basic storyline of a man confined to his apartment and becoming suspicious that a neighbour has murdered his wife, there are a few changes. Christopher Reeve plays the lead character, who is not a photographer but an architect, and has been pompously renamed Jason Kemp. Also the lead female role, played by Daryl Hannah, is not his girlfriend (to begin with) but his colleague. And there are some other differences here and there, such as the lack of exploration into the complexities of relationships, and the fact that Jason Kemp has two medical assistants on call 24 hours instead of an insurance nurse that visits daily. I suppose the makers deviated in these areas so that the film would not look like an exact copy of the original, but these differences do very little, and in some cases let the film down.For a thriller, this film hardly manages to mildly scare. Jeff Bleckner's direction does not labour on key points in the film long enough to generate much tension, nor is there much atmosphere. The film's soundtrack also does not help matters. The best part of the film is Christopher Reeve, who does stand out from a cast with little substance. Thelma Ritter's character of an insurance nurse in Alfred Hitchcock's version, has more spark than the two medical assistants in this film put together. Then again, that may be largely due to the relatively shallow script that the actors have to work with.That being said, this was a very needless remake. Not all of Alfred Hitchcock's films were classics, but when it comes to his best films, I don't believe it's possible to improve on them. Apart from this attempt, 'Psycho' has been remade, as well as multiple remakes of 'The 39 Steps'. Let's hope it stops there.",2,Another needless remake,1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,2128,"['So', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'remade', 'recent', 'years', ""'m"", 'always', 'fascinated', 'why', 'only', 'justifiable', 'reason', 'can', 'see', 'remaking', 'film', 'original', 'had', 'potential', 'was', 'hands', 'wrong', 'director', 'case', ""'Rear"", 'Window', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'original', 'version', 'was', 'close', 'perfection', 'being', 'case', 'why', 'did', 'anyone', 'feel', 'need', 'remake', 'sticking', 'basic', 'storyline', 'man', 'confined', 'apartment', 'becoming', 'suspicious', 'neighbour', 'murdered', 'wife', 'are', 'few', 'changes', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'lead', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'photographer', 'architect', 'been', 'pompously', 'renamed', 'Jason', 'Kemp', 'Also', 'lead', 'female', 'role', 'played', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'not', 'girlfriend', 'begin', 'colleague', 'are', 'other', 'differences', 'here', 'there', 'such', 'lack', 'exploration', 'complexities', 'relationships', 'fact', 'Jason', 'Kemp', 'two', 'medical', 'assistants', 'call', '24', 'hours', 'instead', 'insurance', 'nurse', 'daily', 'suppose', 'makers', 'deviated', 'areas', 'so', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'look', 'exact', 'copy', 'original', 'differences', 'do', 'very', 'little', 'cases', 'let', 'film', 'thriller', 'film', 'hardly', 'mildly', 'scare', 'Jeff', 'Bleckner', 'direction', 'not', 'labour', 'key', 'points', 'film', 'long', 'enough', 'generate', 'much', 'tension', 'there', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'not', 'help', 'matters', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'who', 'stand', 'out', 'cast', 'little', 'substance', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'character', 'insurance', 'nurse', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'version', 'more', 'spark', 'two', 'medical', 'assistants', 'film', 'put', 'together', 'Then', 'again', 'may', 'be', 'largely', 'due', 'relatively', 'shallow', 'script', 'actors', 'have', 'work', 'with.That', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'very', 'needless', 'remake', 'Not', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'were', 'classics', 'when', 'best', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'possible', 'improve', 'Apart', 'attempt', ""'Psycho"", 'been', 'remade', 'as', 'well', 'multiple', 'remakes', '39', 'Steps', 'Let', 'hope', 'there']",Rear Window VHS
