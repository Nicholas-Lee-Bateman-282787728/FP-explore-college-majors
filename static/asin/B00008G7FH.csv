I love the storyline, it is a very Faustian, very grim, storyline about the desire to end world overpopulation by...well...as the chemicals show...creating zombies across the 1st and 2nd world countries.  And things work out pretty darn well...no more overpopulation, everyone's a zombie, and everyone has a meal... the living... a great story, and while the actors and special effects aren't anything to write home about, I think the movie does a great job bringing the story from beginning to end.  The big problem I have with the movie is the transfer of the movie onto DVD.  Now, yes this is a fairly old movie, and it seems that the DVD company that's selling it isn't around (at least I couldn't find it on the net).  Still, one would hope for this price we would see the transfer far clearer than when the movie was viewed on vhs.  I really wish the film was cleaned up enough so that I can see what's going on.  Still, if you like zombie movies, this is a great one, I give the movie itself thumbs up...you'll just be straining your eyes to see what's going on!",3,"Love the movie, but....",1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,1130,"['big', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', ""n't"", 'storyline', 'love', 'storyline', 'very', 'Faustian', 'very', 'grim', 'storyline', 'desire', 'end', 'world', 'overpopulation', 'well', 'chemicals', 'show', 'creating', 'zombies', '1st', '2nd', 'world', 'countries', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'pretty', 'darn', 'well', 'more', 'overpopulation', 'everyone', 'zombie', 'everyone', 'meal', 'living', 'great', 'story', 'actors', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'think', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'big', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'transfer', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Now', 'yes', 'fairly', 'old', 'movie', 'DVD', 'company', 'selling', ""n't"", 'around', 'least', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'net', 'Still', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'price', 'would', 'see', 'transfer', 'far', 'clearer', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'viewed', 'vhs', 'really', 'wish', 'film', 'was', 'cleaned', 'up', 'enough', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'Still', 'like', 'zombie', 'movies', 'great', 'one', 'give', 'movie', 'up', ""'ll"", 'just', 'be', 'straining', 'eyes', 'see', 'what', 'going']",N/A

741755,A218A1NFBSHZ0U,B00008G7FH,David B. Minter,"[3, 6]","Note: This review is for the Night Of The Zombies DVD released by Cydonia Pictures.For those who know the history, Night Of The Zombies is one of the many names for Hell Of The Living Dead.  The transfer for this DVD appears to be the same master tape used by Vestron Home Video in 1985 and Creature Features in 1996.  Both versions has tape creases in the same spots during the opening credits.  And, for those who have seen the 10,000th generation copy version of Vestron's release (I have not personally seen Creature Feature's version on tape.) it is so dark you really cannot see what is going on during a scene!  This transfer is, for sure, Creature Feature's release because the end copyrights state: ""Copyright 1996 Creature Features.""  As stated, get the Hell Of The Living Dead DVD from Anchor Bay.  That one has the exact same cut, with the different titles, plus an untruncated closing credits sequence, BUT most importantly, an original vault film print was used.  It was cleaned up and letterboxed.  FAR superior to this one... which, somehow, is even DARKER!  The color even fades in and out almost as if Macrovision was detected during the transfer!I got this DVD because I'm a Night Of The Zombies completist.  And, even at that, I can't recommend this DVD over Hell, because for the same price or less, you can get the better DVD.  This DVD does have a few extras not on the Hell DVD, but, they are not worth the price of admission: a TV trailer, which consists of the exact same text used in Dawn Of The Dead advertising, 3 ""newspaper ads,"" even though they're the same ad just edited down and truncated, and a stills gallery which has some pictures not in Hell's gallery, including unused scenes or shots entirely for publicity modeled after existing scenes.  There are also two trailers for The Gates Of Hell, interestingly also released by Creature Features in 1996 with Night Of The Zombies, but, one of them is just a shorter version of the other.All in all, not even this Night Of The Zombies completist can recommend this DVD transfer.  It's worse than the Vestron VHS; I could make a better one with my VCR and a DVR!  The extras just aren't worth enough to own it and Hell Of The Living Dead.Lastly, just to address the other question I had had over this DVD.  Yes, this is the Night Of The Zombies directed by Bruno Mattei (As Vincent Dawn.) and not the one starring Jamie Gillis.  So, for anyone else wondering, the front cover art is correct, despite some sites that have listed this exact same DVD as the Jamie Gilis release.  (BTW, interestingly enough, the text on the back cover of this DVD release is exactly the same text used on the Vestron VHS home video release!)",1,Get Hell Of The Living Dead instead!,1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,2703,"['Note', 'review', 'Night', 'Zombies', 'DVD', 'released', 'Cydonia', 'Pictures.For', 'who', 'know', 'history', 'Night', 'Zombies', 'one', 'many', 'names', 'Hell', 'Living', 'Dead', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'be', 'same', 'master', 'tape', 'used', 'Vestron', 'Home', 'Video', '1985', 'Creature', 'Features', '1996', 'versions', 'tape', 'creases', 'same', 'spots', 'opening', 'credits', 'who', 'have', 'seen', '10,000th', 'generation', 'copy', 'version', 'Vestron', 'release', 'have', 'not', 'personally', 'seen', 'Creature', 'Feature', 'version', 'tape', 'so', 'dark', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'scene', 'transfer', 'sure', 'Creature', 'Feature', 'release', 'end', 'copyrights', 'state', 'Copyright', '1996', 'Creature', 'Features', 'stated', 'get', 'Hell', 'Living', 'Dead', 'DVD', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'one', 'exact', 'same', 'cut', 'different', 'titles', 'untruncated', 'closing', 'credits', 'sequence', 'BUT', 'most', 'importantly', 'original', 'vault', 'film', 'print', 'was', 'used', 'was', 'cleaned', 'up', 'letterboxed', 'FAR', 'superior', 'one', 'somehow', 'even', 'DARKER', 'color', 'even', 'out', 'almost', 'Macrovision', 'was', 'detected', 'transfer', 'got', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'Night', 'Zombies', 'completist', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Hell', 'same', 'price', 'less', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'have', 'few', 'extras', 'not', 'Hell', 'DVD', 'are', 'not', 'price', 'admission', 'TV', 'trailer', 'exact', 'same', 'text', 'used', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'advertising', '3', 'newspaper', 'ads', 'even', ""'re"", 'same', 'ad', 'just', 'edited', 'down', 'truncated', 'stills', 'gallery', 'pictures', 'not', 'Hell', 'gallery', 'including', 'unused', 'scenes', 'shots', 'entirely', 'publicity', 'modeled', 'existing', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'trailers', 'Gates', 'Hell', 'interestingly', 'also', 'released', 'Creature', 'Features', '1996', 'Night', 'Zombies', 'one', 'just', 'shorter', 'version', 'other.All', 'not', 'even', 'Night', 'Zombies', 'completist', 'can', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'worse', 'Vestron', 'VHS', 'could', 'make', 'better', 'one', 'VCR', 'DVR', 'extras', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'worth', 'enough', 'own', 'Hell', 'Living', 'Dead.Lastly', 'just', 'address', 'other', 'question', 'had', 'had', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'Night', 'Zombies', 'directed', 'Bruno', 'Mattei', 'Vincent', 'Dawn', 'not', 'one', 'starring', 'Jamie', 'Gillis', 'So', 'anyone', 'else', 'wondering', 'front', 'cover', 'art', 'correct', 'sites', 'have', 'listed', 'exact', 'same', 'DVD', 'Jamie', 'Gilis', 'release', 'BTW', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'text', 'back', 'cover', 'DVD', 'release', 'exactly', 'same', 'text', 'used', 'Vestron', 'VHS', 'home', 'video', 'release']",N/A

741758,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00008G7FH,General Zombie,"[1, 3]","Stan Runk summed it all up pretty well: 'Hell of the Living Dead' is the kinda zombie movie you see after you've seen all the good ones.  And yeah, this is pretty crappy, and not as amusing on a camp level as a lotta other lousy horror movies.  However, if you're the sorta person who is even considering watching this film, you might as well go ahead.  You'll probably enjoy yourself, more or less, though you'll probably just wanna watch 'Dawn of the Dead' or 'The Beyond' again for the 10th time rather than watch this again.Zombie movies have never been too good with plot, and this film is no exception.  There's a not too bright seeming journalist lady, who will get naked, a couple a dudes in blue uniforms who are apparently supposed to be SWAT team members, and zombies.  A whole zombie conspiracy, as a matter of fact, leading to what has got to be the lamest attempt at social commentary your gonna see in a zombie movie outside of 'Dr.Butcher M.D.' perhaps. (That movie is awesome.  Check it out if you haven't seen it, though if you're looking at this, you probably already have.)  The film takes place in New Guinea, I believe, which leaves them ample opportunity to splice in a lot of nature doctumentary footage, and some tribal people documentaries as well.  This is totally the least convincing, most obvious combination of multiple films in the modern era.  Pretty funny.  Some of the stuff they show doesn't seem like it would be in New Guinea, but I've never actually been there, so I can't prove 'em wrong.  It can get boring though.  Still, aside from travel footage Mattei likes to throw in a nice shot of bird or something totally at random, like right after a zombie is attacking someone.  Pieced together doesn't begin to describe it.The zombies are standard Romero style ones, with obviously cheap but passable makeup.  What can I say, zombies are always fun, and these ones aren't bad at all, 'cept they aren't given enough to do.  They do have some of the finest zombie moaning/wheezing I've ever heard, however.  There's some gore, but it's nothing to remarkable.  However, I can't comment on it all that well, as the version I saw was pitch black.  I guess they dropped the print in a tar pit, or something.  Everything was severely murky all the time, and it is literally impossible to make anything out at a few points.  Still, I don't think being able to see it would've helped this movie too much.They stole the soundtrack from 'Dawn of the Dead', and don't use it very well.  That soundtrack was kinda a mixed bag, definitely some of Goblin's weakest work, but the real problem is that they totally don't know how to use it.  The music is frequently highly inappropriate to the scene.  Still, some of it is pretty cool.There's quite a bit of hilarious dubbing, but the movie as whole is a bit too slow moving, with mundane zombie carnage, which makes it not totally work on a camp level.  Still, I was never terribly bored, and more or less amused most of the time, so I can't help but tell other Italian/Zombie horror fans to check it out.  But, it is pretty damn crappy, no doubt about it.Grade: D",2,"Well, that wasn't very good",1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,3136,"['Stan', 'Runk', 'summed', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', ""'Hell"", 'Living', 'Dead', 'kinda', 'zombie', 'movie', 'see', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'ones', 'yeah', 'pretty', 'crappy', 'not', 'amusing', 'camp', 'level', 'lotta', 'other', 'lousy', 'horror', 'movies', 'However', ""'re"", 'sorta', 'person', 'who', 'even', 'considering', 'watching', 'film', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'go', 'ahead', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'more', 'less', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'just', 'wan', 'na', 'watch', ""'Dawn"", 'Dead', ""'The"", 'Beyond', 'again', '10th', 'time', 'rather', 'watch', 'again.Zombie', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'too', 'good', 'plot', 'film', 'exception', 'not', 'too', 'bright', 'seeming', 'journalist', 'lady', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'naked', 'couple', 'dudes', 'blue', 'uniforms', 'who', 'are', 'apparently', 'supposed', 'be', 'SWAT', 'team', 'members', 'zombies', 'whole', 'zombie', 'conspiracy', 'matter', 'fact', 'leading', 'what', 'got', 'be', 'lamest', 'attempt', 'social', 'commentary', 'gon', 'see', 'zombie', 'movie', ""'Dr.Butcher"", 'M.D', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'awesome', 'Check', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'re"", 'looking', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'film', 'place', 'New', 'Guinea', 'believe', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'splice', 'lot', 'nature', 'doctumentary', 'footage', 'tribal', 'people', 'documentaries', 'as', 'well', 'totally', 'least', 'convincing', 'most', 'obvious', 'combination', 'multiple', 'films', 'modern', 'era', 'Pretty', 'funny', 'stuff', 'show', ""n't"", 'seem', 'would', 'be', 'New', 'Guinea', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'been', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prove', ""'em"", 'wrong', 'can', 'get', 'boring', 'though', 'Still', 'aside', 'travel', 'footage', 'Mattei', 'throw', 'nice', 'shot', 'bird', 'something', 'totally', 'random', 'right', 'zombie', 'attacking', 'someone', 'Pieced', 'together', ""n't"", 'begin', 'describe', 'it.The', 'zombies', 'are', 'standard', 'Romero', 'style', 'ones', 'obviously', 'cheap', 'passable', 'makeup', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'zombies', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'ones', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'do', 'do', 'have', 'finest', 'zombie', 'moaning/wheezing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'however', 'gore', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'well', 'version', 'saw', 'was', 'pitch', 'black', 'guess', 'dropped', 'print', 'tar', 'pit', 'something', 'Everything', 'was', 'severely', 'murky', 'time', 'literally', 'impossible', 'make', 'anything', 'out', 'few', 'points', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'would', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'movie', 'too', 'much.They', 'stole', 'soundtrack', ""'Dawn"", 'Dead', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'very', 'well', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'kinda', 'mixed', 'bag', 'definitely', 'Goblin', 'weakest', 'work', 'real', 'problem', 'totally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'use', 'music', 'frequently', 'highly', 'inappropriate', 'scene', 'Still', 'pretty', 'quite', 'bit', 'hilarious', 'dubbing', 'movie', 'whole', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'moving', 'mundane', 'zombie', 'carnage', 'not', 'totally', 'work', 'camp', 'level', 'Still', 'was', 'never', 'terribly', 'bored', 'more', 'less', 'amused', 'most', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'tell', 'other', 'Italian/Zombie', 'horror', 'fans', 'check', 'out', 'pretty', 'damn', 'crappy', 'doubt', 'it.Grade', 'D']",N/A

My Dad,stepbrother and one of my friends went to see it, I was originally going to go, but alas, I chickened out and stayed home. I guess I was afraid of all the gut munching carnage that Zombie films are known for. Well, when my dad and company came back, they were laughin and ranting over how bad Night of The Zombies was. Years later I saw it in the horror section of Blockbuster. By then I had toughened up a little when it came to gore, so I rented it for a get together with my friends. The reaction? Yes, the story was mind numbingly stupid, yes, the soundtrtack was obviously lifted from Dawn Of The Dead, yes, the dubbing was off track with lame and predictable dialouge. But you know what, we were all laughing watching this ""bad""  zombie flik all the way to the ending. Looking back to 1984, my stepbrother was having fun telling his friends not about how bad it was, but all the great kill scenes! Night Of The Zombies may not be Dawn Of The Dead or Lucio Fulci's Zombie, But despite it's cheesy atmosphere (which could be one of it's strong points) it's a hell of alot of fun to watch, if not for the kill scenes, but also for it's sloppy execution.
