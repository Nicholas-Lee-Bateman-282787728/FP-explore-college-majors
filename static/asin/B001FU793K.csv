The worst part, it's not so bad it's funny - it's just plain old awful.Eva Longoria (ultra hot - Desperate Housewives), Jason Biggs (American Pie), and Ed Helms (Andy from the Office) must be out of money. I cannot imagine why these three actors ever agreed to do this film. This has to be a new low for the three of them.This thing is offensive on every imaginable level. The foul language that was supposed to be in front of 10 year old kids, but was clearly edited so they didn't hear most of it. The horrible sight gags. The jokes in really bad taste - one had to do with candles from the concentration camps. The thought that a school can be this poorly run. It's just awful.I have a very wide range of tolerance for movies. I'm not easily offended. I found Step Brothers funny. This film is down right needlessly offensive.

But, this is nothing like American Pie, Road Trip, or that sort of movie. It involves a bunch of screwed up teachers in an elementary school. Cursing, smoking / doing drugs, and cracking raunchy jokes to 6-8 year old kids is not funny.  It is disturbing.  At best, this movie is background noise while you're doing something else.Avoid wasting your money and watch something else. This movie is pure garbage.Also, as to the comment that this is like Family Guy:  This is nothing like that cartoon (which I enjoy!).  These are adults and real elementary school age kids.  It doesn't mix well -- at all.  The net effect is that you actually feel sorry for the kids (who are portrayed as helpless in a poorly run school) rather than amused by the situation.",1,Awful.

1192409,A13GYZ0KXQS98V,B001FU793K,Matt,"[5, 6]","Lower Learning is surprisingly funny at times... it feels like one big improv skit (And the deleted scenes seem to attest to that theory, as 35+ jokes are thrown out there, and only the best 5 are used), and for this movie, it mostly works. The cast is tremendous, I didn't expect to see so many familiar faces, and most are well-known for their roles in movies like this. The stand out for me, in a field of all of these other comic actors is Monica Potter. She is relatively unknown to me, other than a few movies she has been in, and she manages to deliver some of the funniest lines as a down on her luck teacher who is going through a bad marriage. Much of the comedy of Lower Learning is based on kids ""saying the darndest things"", but not all of it. The plot of the story is basically Jason Biggs vs. Rob Corddry in a fight to save a struggling school. Also surprising is some of the stuff Longoria gets to do. She has a running gag as a troubled woman who inhales paint fumes, Cool whip can fumes, chews tobacco, drinks whiskey, abuses pain pills and more. When confronted about her issues, she becomes defensive and asks: ""What is this Nuremberg?"", ""What is this Salem""? She actually had some funny lines here, I'll give her credit for that.",4,Strong comedy as always - thanks to Corddry and his improv cohorts.,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,1250,"['Lower', 'Learning', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'times', 'one', 'big', 'improv', 'skit', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'seem', 'attest', 'theory', '35+', 'jokes', 'are', 'thrown', 'there', 'only', 'best', '5', 'are', 'used', 'movie', 'mostly', 'cast', 'tremendous', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'familiar', 'most', 'are', 'well-known', 'roles', 'movies', 'stand', 'out', 'field', 'other', 'comic', 'actors', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'other', 'few', 'movies', 'been', 'deliver', 'funniest', 'lines', 'down', 'luck', 'teacher', 'who', 'going', 'bad', 'marriage', 'Much', 'comedy', 'Lower', 'Learning', 'based', 'kids', 'saying', 'darndest', 'things', 'not', 'plot', 'story', 'basically', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'vs', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'fight', 'save', 'struggling', 'school', 'Also', 'surprising', 'stuff', 'Longoria', 'do', 'running', 'gag', 'troubled', 'woman', 'who', 'paint', 'fumes', 'Cool', 'whip', 'can', 'fumes', 'chews', 'tobacco', 'drinks', 'whiskey', 'pain', 'pills', 'more', 'When', 'confronted', 'issues', 'defensive', 'What', 'Nuremberg', 'What', 'Salem', 'actually', 'had', 'funny', 'lines', 'here', ""'ll"", 'give', 'credit']",Lower Learning

It does take it to the next level and has many scenarios that you would never want to happen at your kid's elementary school, but that's what makes it so funny.

Starring Jason Biggs, who has never had a problem being in comedies with absurd and crude qualities (ex: the american pies) delivers in this movie. Eva Longoria, is quite hilarious in this too. Yes, very attractive too but if you have seen her in Desperate Housewives you already know that she can deliver when it comes to comedy. Then you have the villain.............Rob Corddry.

This movie is a pure comedy. Do not watch this, expecting an amazing story or acting. I think people who grow up watching Hollywood movies, unconsciously train themselves to judge a movie based on its story. I judge comedies based on how funny they are; this film was made for laughs and I thought it was hilarious. The nature of this story is really over the top and absurd. The teachers curse at the students and the principal basically uses the students as his personal slaves. The comedic moments are based around shock-value.
