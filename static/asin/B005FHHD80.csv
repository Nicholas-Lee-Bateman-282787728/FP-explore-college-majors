1457871,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005FHHD80,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[31, 37]","In an effort to provide provocative late night programming to Showtime, sometimes actor Richard Grieco masterminded a project entitled ""Gigolos."" Charting the lives and adventures of five call boys in glamorous Las Vegas, this reality program strains for credibility. Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against the idea of a show documenting the profession of male escorts. In fact, I think it's a refreshing change of pace amidst the landscape of cable soft core adult entertainment to focus on a few guys for a change. However, nothing about this reality series seems the least bit real.The clients (often labeled with professions as diverse as elementary school teachers or nurse's aides) don't seem like likely candidates to have hundreds of dollars to spend on high end escorts. Some even improbably live in palatial estates or rent extravagant suites for the occasion! No downturned economy here. A remarkable number of these clients also seem to already have a professional film career (if you get my meaning) with their willingness to disrobe, show off their surgical enhancements, and have sex on television. You'd think that professional businesswoman and everyday housewives and mothers might be a bit more prudent about what they allowed to be broadcast on national television. But any doubts about the legitimacy of some of these adventures is squashed by the most obviously fake encounter of the season. One of the guys meets a client in her office (sparsely furnished with rental furniture) and has sex loudly with a secretary right outside the door. Of course, there is a convenient hidden camera in the outer office (how'd that get there?) to capture her reactions to the lovemaking noises. It's silly and harmless titillation, I suppose, it just isn't particularly real.What you're left with is the guys. Do you want to spend time with them? Of course this being forced reality, they hang out together as friends. A particularly painful episode had one (Steven) throw a temper tantrum because his friends didn't celebrate his birthday in the right way. Even though they tried, he stomped about like a petulant child. Sadly, he was probably the most relatable character until then as a struggling father separated from his child. We also have Jimmy, whom I actually liked well enough--a well rounded individual who made the move from stripping to escorting and is at peace with his choice. Then there is Nick who might be pretty enough to look at, but seems incapable of intelligent conversation. And Brace, an aging lothario, who is his own biggest fan. And enthusiastic Vin--a newcomer to the profession that doesn't get quite as much development (although he does get a ludicrous storyline where someone pays him a gigolo fee to attend dance classes).Of course, the show might generate a fair amount of interest just on subject matter. If the topic appeals to you, try to sample an episode or two. I can't imagine anyone would want to watch this more than once, so investing in the DVD isn't an easy recommendation for me to make.
