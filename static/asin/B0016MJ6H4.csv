It is about a guy who receives wolf eyes from a mad scientist/doctor (Justine Bateman) and suddenly he can relate to his inner wolf.  As preposterous as that sounds, it gets worse.  With the new eyes came supersonic hearing as a bonus.  Although how that was managed, is anyone's guess.  Along with the officious automaton doctor (Bateman) there's also a nefarious secret band of military thugs who want the eyeball application then don't want it then want to kill wolf-boy because he's a loose cannon.  This movie relies heavily on nature footage of wolves, which they randomly insert throughout the course of this bizarre sci-fi flick.  There is zero suspense, little to no action, the supposed chewing of another doctor is done off screen, we have to rely on the assertion that he was gnawed to death by wolf-boy.  Eventually, a cast of thousands ends up in a forest where everyone runs wild in the longest/slowest foot chase in the history of the cinema.Not a keeper.",1,"""Don't look back.

I watched, in order:Skeleton Man,Bone Eater, and Monster Wolf. Surely, I thought, if I closed my eyes and just picked a movie at random from my overstuffed Tivo list I would find a film that had nothing to do with white people getting in touch with their Native American spiritual side. I should have kept my eyes closed.Hybrid is obviously inspired by the shirtless spate of werewolves now common to theTwilight. But unlike theTwilightseries, or say, any other movie that involves werewolves, Hybrid has no special effects to speak of. But what it lacks in special effects, it makes up for with grainy stock footage of wolves. Seriously, fifty percent of this movie is just pictures of wolves biting, snarling, playing, and running. Sometimes they kill a buffalo.Theoretically, this is a science fiction film about ""cross-species organ transplants."" When one scientist dares to challenge the logic of how this could possibly work, the response is ""of course such a thing is impossible, which is why it works!"" See what they did there? Clever, huh?Our hero Aaron Scates (Corey Monteith) is the transplant recipient, and it's not long before he begins having wolf visions and wolf instincts, because it makes perfect sense that wolf eyes make you lupine. In between eating raw steaks and not wearing a shirt, Scates encounters museum curator Lydia Armstrong (Tinsel Korey), who recognizes the eyes of the wolf she once tried to help. Armstrong isn't very good at helping anybody, wolf or man, and it's not long before Scates is on the run again.A Special Forces team is tasked with hunting Scates down so that he may be properly exploited for scientific and military purposes. They needn't have bothered - Scates only hops around, growls, pants (yes, there is actually the sound of a dog panting when Scates runs through the forest), and occasionally shows up with blood on his chest.Actors scream in terror to help make up for the fact that there's nothing scary about Scates whatsoever, other actors try to pretend they care about capturing Scates, and wolves flash on the screen for minutes at a time. The ending is stultifying lame, with a record ""fade out"" exit of a main character. That's right, he fades out of the scene.This movie is a real dog. Actually, it's worse than that.

If you bought this thinking that is what you would get, then you will be sorely disappointed.  The gore scenes are extremely tame, particularly for this genre, and the acting seems a bit forced and the plot somewhat two-dimensional.  However, what this movie does do is that it paints the picture of wolves (and werewolves) not as mindless killers but as beings who live in harmony with their environment, and that humans play an essential part in that environment.  It brings forth the Native American message that wolves and humans are brothers, just as we are brothers to all living things, and that is a message that is unfortunately very much missing in modern mainstream cinema, especially in the horror genre.

That said this is a pretty good movie.  Not particularly horror however.  There are some gore scenes but nothing horrid to make you come close to gacking up the turkey on toast with mayo you just ate.  The plot is sort of one dimensional and predictable.

When I first heard about this flick, I joked to my girlfriend that its probably about 'energy efficient werewolves.' Oh how right I was. See, the main plot revolves around an evil medical corporation that implants a wolf's eyes into a blind man, inadvertently turning him into a werewolf. Well, sort of. He just kind of runs around at night with a pack of wolves (or in one case, feral dogs). Naturally, he runs away, with the military-industrial complex chasing after him. During the course of this, he falls in love with a Native American woman and undergoes a 'spiritual quest' to make peace with the wolf-half of himself.Yeah, theres more than a little New Age-y spiritualism going on in there. But that said, its not a bad movie really. They actually hired Native American actors, for one, and had real wolves. And, unlike other movies, they didn't portray the wolves as especially evil or anything. The main thrust of this movie really seems to be man vs. nature, and while it wasn't especially scary or gorey as far as werewolf movies go, it at least was able to keep my interest.
