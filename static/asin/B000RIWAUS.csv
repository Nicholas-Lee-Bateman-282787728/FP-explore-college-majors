1081736,A1N3UUKWLKGDM3,B000RIWAUS,Bisqoti,"[1, 1]","This review is for the 2013 Mill Creek release:Roseanne is my favorite sitcom of all time and this, perhaps even more than season nine, is my least favorite season. There are a few gripes that I have with both this DVD set and the season that lead me to give the two-star review.I'll start with the DVD problems.I have a very strong feeling that these episodes are edited. Not only do they clock in at just under 23 minutes, in the other Mill Creek releases the episodes last 24+ minutes. On top of that the most famous ending sequence of this show is missing from the DVD, when Sarah Chalke and Lecy Goranson have the Patty Duke homage.Also, the extras are LIMITED, and the video commentary with Roseanne and Michael Fishman made me feel uncomfortable, like there was no chemistry between them at all.Now, my problems with this season in general. This season was very unfunny compared to others. And until the tail end of the season, it's not even dramatic. That lead to many episodes feeling like they were just thrown together in order to add an extra season to the show. Lecy's return was welcomed with open arms but her Becky character started off rusty, like she forgot how to play Becky, up until mid season. There is almost no interaction between the couples (Darlene/David, Becky/Mark) for the majority of the season. And John Goodman seemed very out of place this season, like he didn't want to be there anymore. On top of it all, some episodes were aired out of filming schedule which lead to some confusion for example *SPOILER ALERT* several episodes after the baby is born, Roseanne is pregnant again and Dan still has his beard.If you love Roseanne buy this DVD, if you need to finish your collection of Roseanne DVD's, buy this DVD. If you have no idea what Roseanne is and are only semi-interested, buy seasons 2-6 and call it a day.",2,Roseanne Season Eight...,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,1850,"['review', '2013', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'release', 'Roseanne', 'favorite', 'sitcom', 'time', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'season', 'nine', 'least', 'favorite', 'season', 'are', 'few', 'gripes', 'have', 'DVD', 'set', 'season', 'lead', 'give', 'two-star', 'review.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'DVD', 'problems.I', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'feeling', 'episodes', 'are', 'edited', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'clock', 'just', '23', 'minutes', 'other', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'episodes', 'last', '24+', 'minutes', 'top', 'most', 'famous', 'ending', 'sequence', 'show', 'missing', 'DVD', 'when', 'Sarah', 'Chalke', 'Lecy', 'Goranson', 'have', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'homage.Also', 'extras', 'are', 'LIMITED', 'video', 'commentary', 'Roseanne', 'Michael', 'Fishman', 'made', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'was', 'chemistry', 'all.Now', 'problems', 'season', 'general', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'unfunny', 'compared', 'others', 'tail', 'end', 'season', 'not', 'even', 'dramatic', 'lead', 'many', 'episodes', 'feeling', 'were', 'just', 'thrown', 'together', 'order', 'add', 'extra', 'season', 'show', 'Lecy', 'return', 'was', 'welcomed', 'open', 'arms', 'Becky', 'character', 'started', 'off', 'rusty', 'forgot', 'how', 'play', 'Becky', 'up', 'mid', 'season', 'almost', 'interaction', 'couples', 'Darlene/David', 'Becky/Mark', 'majority', 'season', 'John', 'Goodman', 'seemed', 'very', 'place', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'anymore', 'top', 'episodes', 'were', 'aired', 'filming', 'schedule', 'lead', 'confusion', 'example', '*SPOILER', 'ALERT*', 'several', 'episodes', 'baby', 'born', 'Roseanne', 'pregnant', 'again', 'Dan', 'still', 'beard.If', 'love', 'Roseanne', 'buy', 'DVD', 'need', 'finish', 'collection', 'Roseanne', 'DVD', 'buy', 'DVD', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Roseanne', 'are', 'only', 'semi-interested', 'buy', 'seasons', '2-6', 'call', 'day']",Roseanne: Season 8
1081737,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000RIWAUS,calvinnme,"[47, 60]","Season eight of Roseanne is the one where everything finally began to truly come apart. This is not to say there aren't some good episodes, but you have to really pick through episodes full of fantasy, inane slapstick, and politically correct undertones to get to the truly good blue collar slice-of-life episodes that made up the majority of episodes in prior years. WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD.The season opener, ""Shower the People You Love with Stuff"", very unceremoniously returns Lecy Gorenson as Becky Conner Healy, with  Roseanne taking advantage of the sudden replacement with an inside joke by remarking that it seems like Becky's been gone for four years - exactly how long Lecy Gorenson has been gone from the show. The end of the show makes fun of the switch of actresses playing Becky even more with a clever imitation of the opening theme song of 60's series ""The Patty Duke Show"" in which Patty Duke played twin cousins. It is a good opener to the season, but it is not typical of what follows.One problem with season eight is that Roseanne NEVER did fantasy episodes well during any season. Fortunately, past seasons had limited doses of them. In season eight, though, we get ""Halloween: The Final Chapter"", ""The Fifties Show"", ""Springtime for David"", and ""The Getaway, Almost"". Not all of these episodes are pure fantasy. Some of them, such as ""The Getaway"" are more politically correct slapstick than anything. However, they all seem like outrageous and disjointed half hour comedy skits involving characters who hardly know each other rather than part of a show about a middle class family trying to get by the trials that life throws their way. It was particularly sad to see what became of the Halloween episode this year, always a Roseanne staple. Gone are the outrageous costumes and the clever pranks of previous years. They have now been replaced by a circus of the absurd and the bizarre.Episodes that seem to have been conceived for the sole purpose of preaching political correctness are ""The Last Thursday in November"", which is the Thanksgiving episode, ""The Last Date"" with Dan and Roseanne crashing a bar mitzvah, and the most outrageous of the three, ""December Bride"" in which Scott and Leon get married.  The odd contradiction in ""December Bride"" is that Roseanne, who is supposed to be so open-minded and is acting as Scott and Leon's wedding planner, has decorated the room in which the wedding is to be held in outrageously bad taste using every stereotype in the book. This episode stands out as a real waste. It had the opportunity for several interesting things to happen - for Leon and Roseanne to finally bond and also to explore the prejudices against such unions in middle America (this was 1995 in small-town Illinois after all), just to name a couple. Instead we get another outrageous slapstick episode in which the most interesting thing that happens is Leon kissing Roseanne to figure out if he actually might be straight when he gets a case of the pre-wedding jitters.There are some good episodes sprinkled through the season, but the best episodes are towards the end starting with Darlene's unexpected pregnancy, the result of a night of passion with David during the Conners' trip to Disneyland. However, Darlene and David have a plan figured out that includes marriage. Roseanne does some fine acting here, really showing the disappointment of a woman who realizes she married the right man perhaps too soon, now also realizing that both her daughters have followed in her footsteps and she is powerless to do anything about it. ""The Wedding"", which features David and Darlene's wedding, is much better viewing than the one featuring Scott and Leon. There is a great father-daughter moment between Dan and Darlene where Dan apologizes to Darlene for being angry at her and gives her a key to a bank box with some extra money. When Dan tells her not to put off her dreams because some day she'll realize that time and her dreams have passed her by, you realize Dan is really talking about his own life. Mark and David also have a great moment when David says that he wishes their parents were there. Mark suddenly comes out of the village clown mode he has been in since 1993 and wisely tells David that their parents really had no right to be there because they had never behaved as parents. The Conners had done what their own parents should have, and really were, in fact, their parents by action if not genetics.Unfortunately, there is another life altering event that occurs that day that shatters the newlyweds' plans - Dan's heart attack. This is the subject of the last two episodes. Dan survives his heart attack, but when he comes home from the hospital he finds it impossible to change his ways. The season ends with Dan and Roseanne having a huge fight over Dan's resistance to a healthier lifestyle that concludes with a miniature Godzilla crashing into the Conners' television screen -  a fitting metaphor for season nine.",3,Everything starts to come apart this season,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,4986,"['Season', 'eight', 'Roseanne', 'one', 'where', 'everything', 'finally', 'began',

First episode they cut the whole ending off.  No Patty Duke Show ending?  They play that part on Nick at Nite!  Then on the Direct to Video episode they cut a theme song that ruins the entire joke.  The family is watching TV while Roseanne is out of the room and Dan says ""You know, this was the 'Friends' of the 70's"".  The joke doesn't work on the DVD because it is not the theme song they originally played.  They played the Three's Company theme song and on the DVD it is some generic 70's sounding song with no lyrics.  How much could it possibly cost to get the rights to use a couple of seconds of an old TV theme song?  I know these companies can afford it.  Speaking of money, I'm sick of paying $25 or more for butchered TV shows I can see on regular TV.  If this had been uncut I would have given it 4 stars but cut up only gets a 2 star rating.

1081751,A5GIYITYJPWN1,B000RIWAUS,"L P ""lilip""","[7, 11]","Season 8 of Roseanne is boring, unimaginative, lame and simply at that point where you wish they had just canceled the show already. Every episode is more absurd and far fetched than the other, with fantasy interludes, and slapstick and just way too many references to the actors' real life situations (like Roseanne's pregnancy and baby and plastic surgery, her bodyguard husband, Lecy Goranson being gone for three years, naming the baby Jerry Garcia). Rarely any episode has anything to do with the characters and their development.Jackie's character has been reduced to that of a clown holding a baby. Every now and then she appears and makes a funny grimace and says something insanely slapstick, holds her baby and is gone again. Unlike all the other seasons, she has pretty much zero relationship with her sister Roseanne (and no life apparently).Dan's role has also been reduced to that of a mere piece of furniture or fixture, every now and then appearing in an episode, either fixing a chair, or reading a newspaper, lying on the couch or being humiliated by Roseanne. He lost a lot of the spunk and loveliness he had and that special kind of rapport with his wife. At times it feels like he is barely there and just reciting a line on the show, delivering banal cliches right on time because it's in his contract. He is slow, bland, colorless - nothing but a mere pawn for Roseanne to push around and insult; a mere fixture in the room with no say about what is going on in his family and life and apparently no clue as what is even going on with him.Oh and Michael Fishman, aka DJ: he has grown up to be the sadistic, messed up version of his mother (if that is possible). He is mean, misanthropic, manipulative; the sick, sadistic kind that enjoys torturing small animals and genuinely takes pleasure in someone else's pain and misery. You know, the kind you see in documentaries growing up to be just wonderful serial killers. Just like his mother, he is an extremely unpleasant character to be around, especially because Michael Fishman cannot act and nothing he says, even if it is meant as a joke or humorous, come across as funny and humorous.And finally....there is Roseanne: she is mean, vile, self centered, misanthropic at heart and just like her son, an extremely unpleasant person to be around. While in the first 5 or 6 seasons, there was a charm to her character and its causticity, because she was genuine and real, in Seasons 7 and 8, there is a bitter aftertaste in your mouth every time she is in a scene and opens her mouth. She never has anything intelligent to say, she never listens to anyone and she talks sh$%t ALL THE TIME. She treats everyone like crap and while before that was actually cute, it is very annoying and sickening now. I think it has to do with the fact that Roseanne Barr herself, while this season was being shot, was having the hyper kind of life, getting plastic surgery like it was going out of style and divorcing her second husband to marry her bodyguard etc. and becoming arrogant due to the previous success of the show. She is just horrible and I dont know how Dan or Jackie or any of the other characters put up with her.Nothing that made this show great, like its great, genuine sense of humor, its similarity to real, salt of the earth people with real problems, Dan's and Roseanne's relationship, their struggles...none of it is there anymore. It is way too focused on what was going on around and outside of the show when this was airing and on Roseanne barr's self bravado.

It's very insulting to many viewers I'm sure to hear if they live in a mobile they are FAILURES and might even want to consider ending their lives. I wonder while they were filming this stuff if they didn't think about the huge part of their fan base who probably lives in mobile homes! Hey, if you get by and are happy you are on the right track. Isn't that what this show started out to be?? I live in an apartment but I thought Mark and Becky's trailer look very cute on the inside, and isn't that what counts? I think it's just another example of how low and poor the writing became.I wouldn't have  believed it. But it's true. I have collected all of the other seasons and have been amazed with the tremendous season long story arcs that delved into very private and serious issues, and for a comedy that was going above and beyond. That all seems absent in season 8. What we get is an unnecessary birth (only necessary in light of having no good story lines) with an unfunny name (Jerry Garcia, bah-ha) and a collection of episodes that seem like parodies of the past characters.It's tough to begrudge a show like this that has given so much for so long, after all, every other season wasn't perfect (never cared for her ""factory job"") but they were honest, this season seems like it's coasting not so much on what has been written but what can be rewritten and it's all for the worst. As a fan you have to own this for the completion of your collection but it should be kept on the other side of the room; yes, it's just not good, and I can't believe it all dissolved so fast!
