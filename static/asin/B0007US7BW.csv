Not having seen Rounders- the constant referral to it by the producers in the behind the scenes shots meant little. I watched this through  in 3 sittings and was thoroughly entertained. Madsen as The Matador is chilling- his gravelly voice is full of such menace you wonder why everyone around him isn't in constant fear.....the three young poker players do an admirable job of pulling themselves together and through difficulties to bring down their nemesis. Lots of subplots all culminate in some tricky crime drama worthy of Tony Soprano.Series is written by veteran mystery/crime writer Lawrence Block. His direct verbal style translates well to the Vegas poker scene. What I really liked here was the showing of the gambling world as a not too pretty place- lots of glitz on the surface but murky depths that few care to dwell in. Don McManus as Lowball is such slime- a bottom dweller unable to give up power and the game as head of the Colorado casino where the action in Tilt takes place.Stylish, fun- full of pretty boys and girls but not too much t&a-; this is a guilty pleasure I look forward to seeing more of!",4,Guilty Pleasure!,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,1267,"['So', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'set', 'Walmart', 'love', 'Eddie', 'Cibrian', 'enjoy', 'solid', 'drama', 'thought', 'series', 'looked', 'interesting', 'packaging', 'Not', 'having', 'seen', 'Rounders-', 'constant', 'referral', 'producers', 'scenes', 'shots', 'meant', 'little', 'watched', '3', 'sittings', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'Madsen', 'Matador', 'chilling-', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'full', 'such', 'menace', 'wonder', 'why', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'constant', 'fear', '..the', 'three', 'young', 'poker', 'players', 'do', 'admirable', 'job', 'pulling', 'together', 'difficulties', 'bring', 'down', 'nemesis', 'Lots', 'subplots', 'culminate', 'tricky', 'crime', 'drama', 'worthy', 'Tony', 'Soprano.Series', 'written', 'veteran', 'mystery/crime', 'writer', 'Lawrence', 'Block', 'direct', 'verbal', 'style', 'well', 'Vegas', 'poker', 'scene', 'What', 'really', 'liked', 'here', 'was', 'showing', 'gambling', 'world', 'not', 'too', 'pretty', 'place-', 'lots', 'glitz', 'surface', 'murky', 'depths', 'few', 'care', 'dwell', 'Don', 'McManus', 'Lowball', 'such', 'slime-', 'bottom', 'dweller', 'unable', 'give', 'up', 'power', 'game', 'head', 'Colorado', 'casino', 'where', 'action', 'Tilt', 'place.Stylish', 'fun-', 'full', 'pretty', 'boys', 'girls', 'not', 'too', 'much', 't', 'a-', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more']",N/A
891114,AOQXQYFJNLSLK,B0007US7BW,"Mikey A. ""movie watcher""","[6, 8]","In the first season of ""Tilt"", Michael Madsen proves himself to be the most underrated character actor around today.  He literally carries this series on his back, surmounting really bad writing, questionable direction and god-awful supporting acting, and single-handedly raises its status from 'utterly useless' to 'worth-watching'.The weak points of the show (and there are many) are evident from the first episode and don't really improve.  Fortunately, however, so are the few strong points.The weak?- Aside from Madsen, and an all too short lived appearance by veteran Robert Forster, the acting is as bad as you'll ever see.  The cast is mainly made up of unknowns and rookies, a result undoubtedly of a shallow ESPN budget that was probably spent almost in full, justifiably, to obtain Madsen for his role.- The writing is almost as bad as the acting, consisting of lame backstories to establish the motivations of the characters, uninteresting and cliche' sub-plots to fill the space between Madsen's appearances on the screen and enough poker lingo to make even Doyle Brunson's head spin.  (To the writers' credit, the lingo is well-placed enough, but delivered by the actors like a foreign language they don't speak.)- The direction tries to be a little too slick, maybe to make up for the weakness of the script and the acting, or evidencing rookie status of the director(s), trying to be Scorcese and Tarantino at the same time.- The protagonist, the purported hero of this story, is, in my humble opinion, the worst of it.  ""Eddie"" is as hard to believe as Keanu Reeves playing Hamlet.  He sports permanent 3 or 4 day scruff throughout each of the nine episodes, apparently never shaving but never quite gaining full growth, and despite his street-tough, 'nothing but the shirt on my back' image, has somehow collected an endless supply of clever t-shirts (he never wears the same one twice).  My favorite 'Eddie' scene is the one where the Matador (Madsen) beats him senseless.  :)  Cold-hearted, I know.  In my crystal ball, I see that Eddie Cibrian will take his place next to Keanu as one of the highest paid and least talented actors in the business.The strong?- Madsen. That's it. But it's enough. Madsen's powerful screen presence makes it impossible to take your eyes off the screen when he's on it. In 'Tilt', he's as cool but amusing as Mr. Blonde and as ruthless but sympathetic as Sonny Black. More than any other actor in the series, he seems to bring his own sensibility to the character, defining Don Everest via his performance, adding richness to what was probably originally written as a sheer cliche'.  Also, somehow the dialogue in Madsen's scenes is not bad, actually good, and more importantly, believable.  Which makes me think he either did a lot of add-libbing or was the only actor on the set with the sense and the clout to work script approval into his contract.In short, 'Tilt' is worth watching if only for Madsen's performance.

Michael Madsen, who has been in everything from Reservoir Dogs to Species to Free Willy to Kill Bill, plays Don ""the Matador"" Everest the king of this poker playing world, and his performances throughout these nine episodes are worth the price of admission alone.  However, there isn't much else here that is worth seeing, and the screen writing is by far the weakest part of Tilt bar none.  The story of Tilt revolves around three young gamblers (Eddie Cibrian, Kristin Lehman, and Todd Williams) who are gathered in an effort to take down the Matador, while there is a season long subplot of a sheriff (the Wire's Chris Bauer) who is looking for his brother's killer, and the trail leads to Everest.  Along the way, Eddie gets involved with Everest's mouth wateringly hot daughter, and a season ending poker showdown is more miss than hit.  Despite all that, there's plenty to admire here for poker enthusiasts (with cameos galore from poker champs), and by the time Robert Forster graces the screen the show is practically saved from mediocrity.

891116,A1SHYIS7SOIU2O,B0007US7BW,obediah,"[4, 6]","If you are a poker tragic like myself, you will spend a lot of your watching time picking apart the technical flaws that are readily apparent in this series. The series opens with some abysmal trash talking and cheesy dialogue. For an example of what genuine, entertaining trash talk is like, pick up any poker DVD with Mike Matusow at the table. The acting begins horribly but gradually improves perhaps as the actors begin to warm to their roles. In the beginning when our young poker hot shot threatens the team leader with ""Heads up old man I'll take whatever you have on you"" I almost burst out laughing. As the series progresses these moments of unintentional levity become gradually less frequent.A lot of the poker aspects of the series are unrealistic. The poker room manager is shown belittling the client and there is a scene depicting an underground card game where participants draw pistols on each other in the middle of a hand. Although this may have happened in the ""old school"" Las Vegas, these scenes would never occur in modern Vegas where the series is set. There are also other highly implausible narrative devices that I won't reveal in my review for fear of spoiling the plot. The game of poker in and of itself provides plenty of drama and I think that the script writers relied far too much on cheating and violence to inject spice into the series.Having said all that the series is surprisingly watchable. It definitely improves toward the end and although the technical flaws are distracting, it does not detract too much from the overall enjoyability of the series.

891118,A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,B0007US7BW,Scooter McGavin,"[2, 2]","Last night was the season finale of ESPN's latest stab at original programming, Tilt. And if you didn't catch the promos where they contently mentioned it, Tilt is from the makers of Rounders. And if you didn't see the promos, you can tell just by watching the show with Eddie Cibrian doing his best Matt Damon impression. It almost seems that Eddie Towne could Mike McDermott before he gave up gambling. And they both were playing for revenge against the bad guy. I seemed to miss why Eddie, or Clark for that matter, held a grudge against the Matador, but that was one of many plot points I didn't pick up. But the big difference between the movie and show were the bad guys. Rounders had the cerebral villain in Teddy KGB where Tilt instead went for the mussel with Don 'The Matador' Everest. Both were perfectly cast. John Malkovich fit the intelligent poker player to a tee where Michael Madsen took being bad to an all new level pulling out all the stops to win short of cutting off some one's ear. In the token hot chick category, Rounders wins in a landslide. It was almost like they took the token hot chick from Rounders, gave her a couple whacks with the ugly stick, and then played her on Tilt. It was such a discrepancy, by the middle of the season they had to bring in a second token hot chick.As a TV show, Tilt ran into some problems. As mentioned before, the show was had to follow at times and seemed to leave out some important information. They started off the show with an obvious swerve when the black guy attacks the white guy at the poker table. Looking back, the writer may have planned it to be obvious, as the Matador made reference to it after he turned on Eddie. Other burning question that were not answered or I just missed were what did the Iowa cop's brother do to get killed? Or why didn't Lowball threaten blackmail when he fired? Why did the Matador kill Skip himself while the tournament was going on? There were many holes that need to be filled. I even had to check out the website to see who killed themselves in the last episode.Tilt did have many plot twists that I didn't see coming like killing Seymour off early. The big three being caught when the first tried to bring down the Matador. Clark's friend's secretary being FBI. And they save the best for last when it was revealed that the Matador threw the tournament. The final couple episodes was when the show as a whole pick up in the entertainment department with Norman Chad making he benign comments and the personal profile of the internet player who promptly got bounced in first round.
