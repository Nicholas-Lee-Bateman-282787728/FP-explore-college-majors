Lou Diamond Phillips plays a CID (Criminal Investigations Division) Warrant Officer investigating the murder of the wife of a MP (Military Police) Sergeant.  He is hindered at every turn by people who don't want him investigating the case.  There is a bit of a pissing contest going on between Phillips' character and the MP commander that adds to the suspense.  While this film is not as good or as well done as The Presidio, starring Mark Harmon, Sean Connery and Meg Ryan, it is a good movie.  If you haven't seen it, it will keep you guessing.  I give this film a solid four stars and recommend it to anyone who likes a good whodunit.  I must also compliment Jason Priestly for the fine job he does as the victims brother.  In my opinion, he stole the show.",4,A Good Movie.,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,883,"['Murder', 'Presidio', 'based', 'only', 'murder', 'ever', 'happened', 'military', 'reservation', 'known', 'Presidio', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'CID', 'Criminal', 'Investigations', 'Division', 'Warrant', 'Officer', 'investigating', 'murder', 'wife', 'MP', 'Military', 'Police', 'Sergeant', 'hindered', 'turn', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'investigating', 'case', 'bit', 'pissing', 'contest', 'going', 'Phillips', 'character', 'MP', 'commander', 'suspense', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'Presidio', 'starring', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'good', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'give', 'film', 'solid', 'four', 'stars', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'whodunit', 'must', 'also', 'compliment', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'fine', 'job', 'victims', 'brother', 'opinion', 'stole', 'show']",N/A

912081,A3DIVTJC2HVNJF,B0009S4II8,DAVID SIMONS,"[2, 4]","You'd never know it from the title, but this made-for-TV cheapie revolves around the investigation of a Murder at the Presidio. (No, it's not Bruce Brugmann strangling S.F.'s own Nancy Pelosi... he's saving his homicide efforts for the PG&E; cabal.) Due to the military backdrop, you think you're in for a story of a rogue detective who won't back down in the face of massive political corruption and deadly intimidation from the status quo. As it turns out, you're really getting a color-by-numbers murder investigation with just a whiff of the 'Few Good Men' vibe thrown in. On the plus side, you don't have to hear Tom Cruise screeching about wanting ""the truth"" and having Jack Nicholson counter ""You want the truth, start by coming out of the closet, bitch!!""I'm sorry... Anyway, Lou Diamond Phillips, thinking he might be onto another ""Courage Under Fire,"" does the best he can with what little he's given. He easily outshines his supporting cast -- not saying much, given that Eugene Clark delivers an early candidate for worst performance of the century. (He's yelling... I think he's mad... or maybe angry.) Jason Priestley, tired of strangers peppering him with ""Where's Brenda?"" taunts, cleverly disguises his identity with the help of a spare chin. There are some women in the cast, none of whom warrant a mention. Oh, and extra fireworks are supplied by Fullerton's own JASON STEWART, thrilling clones nationwide with his nuanced portrayal of 'Mafia Suit.' Sure, he doesn't appear especially 'Mafia,' and he's not technically wearing a 'suit.' But when he's dramatically blasted through the upstairs railings of a hangar-cum-barn and left for dead on the ground, there isn't a dry eye in the Blockbuster.Did I mention that the killer's identity turns out to be totally implausible, notwithstanding the fact that 'Presidio' is based on a true story?

Jones ""Howard Jones""","[1, 1]","Warrant Officer James Chandler (Lou Diamond Phillips) goes to investigate the murder of Thelma Atkins (Leslie Easterbrook) at the army base of the Presidio in San Francisco - a movie based on the true story of the only homicide at that base. Captain Donovan (Eugene Clark) and the MPs try to get rid of him on the grounds that it's just a case of a robbery that became violent. But as there was quite valuable jewellery left on the victim's body, Chandler is unconvinced and decides to investigate on his own. Inevitably, the victim's husband, Sergeant Barry Atkins (Martin Cummins) is the main suspect. There have been robberies at the base and Chandler tracks down the ring operating the thefts - and so does Atkins. Atkins provokes a gunfight, killing all the perpetrators of the robbery, claiming that they were also the people responsible for his wife's death. Chandler is unconvinced and with the help of Corporal Diana Phillips (Luciana Carro) tracks down the true culprits.
