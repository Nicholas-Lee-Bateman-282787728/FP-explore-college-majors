She seems like a woman who really cares about you and can make you feel comfortable. I did not enjoy this workout as much as I enjoyed her Fit to the Hits. Was looking for more great and fun dance moves, but Fit to the Hits is funner to me. She is a multicultural dance teacher and you can enjoy her workout if you are any race.",4,Tamilee is a happy woman.,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,379,"['enjoy', 'participating', 'workout', 'Tamilee', 'woman', 'who', 'really', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Fit', 'Hits', 'Was', 'looking', 'more', 'great', 'fun', 'dance', 'moves', 'Fit', 'Hits', 'funner', 'multicultural', 'dance', 'teacher', 'can', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'are', 'race']",N/A

However, it is so much fun because the music is so motivating (an important ingredient that is missing from many workout videos), that I love to do it from time to time, but I add extra impact, hops or jumps where ever it's practical. Sometimes, I wear ankle and wrist weights to make it more challenging. Perfect 1/2 hour of cardio before a weight workout. I like to alternate it with Rock Hard Assests, but this is definitely the better one.

717201,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,B00006IUHO,C. Daly,"[31, 31]","I absolutely love this workout.  It is so much fun, and even though I'm totally uncoordinated, I caught on to the steps pretty fast.  It is set to five familiar Motown hits, including ""Sugar Pie"" ""Nowhere to Run"" and ""Heard it through the Grapevine.""  Although this is not my favorite kind of music, it was upbeat and easy to dance to, unlike the bland music featured in many workout videos.  Each song has a dance she teaches you to go along with it.  You slowly build up the dance and then do it in its entirety 2-3 times before moving on to the next song.  Tamilee encourages you to add your own flair to the moves--the focus is on having a good time.  She does sing, but not for very long, and it didn't really bother me.  If you don't want to hear her, you can turn off the instructor and just listen to the music when you have the moves down.  This workout is pretty good for a beginner.  It is mostly low intensity, although there are some skips, hops, and jumps.  I modify these down pretty often because I like to do the workout barefoot. However, if you modified the moves up, with higher jumps, it could be an intermediate level. Whenever I really don't want to get off the couch, I put in this DVD because the 30 minutes flies by.My only complaint is the 2 minute Natural Journeys ad at the beginning that you can't fast forward through.  That is such an insult to your customers.",5,Incredibly fun workout for days I don't feel like working out,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,1392,"['absolutely', 'love', 'workout', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'even', ""'m"", 'totally', 'uncoordinated', 'caught', 'steps', 'pretty', 'fast', 'set', 'five', 'familiar', 'Motown', 'hits', 'including', 'Sugar', 'Pie', 'Nowhere', 'Run', 'Heard', 'Grapevine', 'not', 'favorite', 'kind', 'music', 'was', 'upbeat', 'easy', 'dance', 'bland', 'music', 'featured', 'many', 'workout', 'videos', 'song', 'dance', 'go', 'along', 'slowly', 'build', 'up', 'dance', 'then', 'do', 'entirety', '2-3', 'times', 'moving', 'next', 'song', 'Tamilee', 'add', 'own', 'flair', 'moves', 'focus', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'sing', 'not', 'very', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'instructor', 'just', 'listen', 'music', 'when', 'have', 'moves', 'down', 'workout', 'pretty', 'good', 'beginner', 'mostly', 'low', 'intensity', 'are', 'skips', 'hops', 'jumps', 'modify', 'down', 'pretty', 'often', 'like', 'do', 'workout', 'barefoot', 'However', 'modified', 'moves', 'up', 'higher', 'jumps', 'could', 'be', 'intermediate', 'level', 'Whenever', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'off', 'couch', 'put', 'DVD', '30', 'minutes', 'flies', 'by.My', 'only', 'complaint', '2', 'minute', 'Natural', 'Journeys', 'ad', 'beginning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fast', 'forward', 'such', 'insult', 'customers']",N/A

There are some very sweet cool moves Tamilee teaches that are ones you've seen in dance productions like Grease and so on, but she makes them so easy that you can do them right away and really make them expressive and your own. I love how Tamilee keeps inspiring the viewer to do it their own way, to get into it, to have fun, to let go. It's funny when she says, 'no one is watching you so let go!' Anyway, it's over before you know it and it's not an intensive workout like her assets ones but it has its own unique value in getting you going and getting you into moving above all else. I'll definitely use this video everytime I'm unmotivated to get moving, as a super warm-out, or as a stand-alone workout just for fun and a great mood lift!

717207,A1SWMOHC2S4HB5,B00006IUHO,"Raina Singh ""Mmmarshmallow""","[23, 23]","Finally! A workout that pumps up the music and focuses on having fun and being yourself.I have done plenty of other workouts that are much mroe intense and much more difficult than this one, but they can never be as rewarding as this workout is.  At the end of Denise Austins' Ultimate Fat Burner, I am ready to go to bed and hide - I do not look forward to doing it again, even though it is a very well designed and effective interval training circuit.  With this workout, however, I am energised and pumped and am itching to do the workout again - and for me, this is key.Even though the workout is not difficult, I found myself having so much fun that I was willing to put more energy into it than I would in other workouts.  This was because I responded to Tamilee's prompts of 'giving it all you've got', and 'letting loose'. Somehow she just managed to lure me out of being in a tight aerobics shell and break out into dance. I shall admit that there have been moments where I have been so into the groove of a particular step in a combination that I keep on doing it instead of moving on.Tamilee is good at cueing, laid back and motivating without being girly, mushy or perky. In this DVD of Fit to the Hits, she does break out into song, but not much. If you have the Rock Hard Assets DVD, she sings a lot more - this doesn't bother me too much, but some people have based their entire judgement of the workout based on her singing. For chrissake, once you've got the moves down, you can switch to the music only version if it bothers you that much. For me, the breaking out into song contributes to the laid-back-be-yourself-cut-loose-have-fun atmosphere.The moves are not complicated. Tamilee cues very well and takes you through difficult moves at half time before performing the move at tempo. If you can do a mambo, toe-taps, a pony or a step-touch - then you can do this workout. There are a several bits of the workout which are high impact, and she doesn't tell you how you can modify them, so you just have to think of how to modify yourself.  This workout has more high impact segments than Rock Hard Assets, so I'd consider this to be slightly more difficult of the two.Now, here are the songs, in order of appearance:1 - Signed Sealed Delivered (Warmup)2 - Sugar Pie Honey Bunch3 - Nowhere to Run4 - Uptight5 - This Old Heart of Mine6 - I Heard it Through the Grapevine (Cooldown)Now, some things that bother me about the DVD - and this is common to both of the Fit to the Hits workouts. Why the exercisers in the DVD wear school-girl theatre costumes is beyond me. Perhaps it is to try and contribute to the relaxed atmosphere that Tamilee creates with her attitude; but really they look a bit out of place for a workout. I personally prefer a streamlined appearance to the exercisers in my workouts - something that the producers of Denise Austin's recent DVDs have done very well. (Personal Training System, Blast Away the Pounds, Burn Fat Fast and Power Zone: The Ultimate Metabolism Boosting Workout).The other thing I'm not too impressed about is the 4min Natural Journeys advert that precedes the workout. There is no way to skip over or fast-forward this advert, and is quite frustrating. If you have any of Natural Journey's more recent DVDs - like Sara Ivanhoe's 20min Yoga Makeovers or Rainbeau Mars's Yoga For Beauty series - they have changed the prdocution so that you can fast forward through this advert. It is a shame that it is not possible on this DVD though.A lot of reviewers have complained that they have yet to find any cardio by Tamilee that matches the toning workouts from 'I want that body'. They might be interested to know that on each of the Fit to the Hits DVDs, there is a bonus cardio workout from the 'I want that body' series. On Motown Moves, there is a Cardio 1 Segment from 'I want that body'; and yet Tamilee does primarily toning movements with one set of weights and a mat, she does them at such pace that it mimics cardio and elevates your heart rate. This workout is 15mins long, as per the other workouts from the 'I want that body' series.Summary:- Fun dancy cardio; steps not too difficult- Good cueing- Occasional breaks out into song, bad clothes- Good extras- Good music!",5,A Movin' and Groovin' good time for those who like to boo-gay,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,4241,"['Finally', 'workout', 'up', 'music', 'having', 'fun', 'being', 'yourself.I', 'have', 'done', 'plenty', 'other', 'workouts', 'are', 'much', 'mroe', 'intense', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'as', 'rewarding', 'workout', 'end', 'Denise', 'Austins', 'Ultimate', 'Fat', 'Burner', 'am', 'ready', 'go', 'bed', 'hide', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'forward', 'doing', 'again', 'even', 'very', 'well', 'designed', 'effective', 'interval', 'training', 'circuit', 'workout', 'however', 'am', 'energised', 'pumped', 'am', 'itching', 'do', 'workout', 'again', 'key.Even', 'workout', 'not', 'difficult', 'found', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'was', 'willing', 'put', 'more', 'energy', 'would', 'other', 'workouts', 'was', 'responded', 'Tamilee', 'prompts', ""'giving"", ""'ve"", 'got', ""'letting"", 'loose', 'Somehow', 'just', 'managed', 'lure', 'being', 'tight', 'aerobics', 'shell', 'break', 'out', 'dance', 'shall', 'admit', 'have', 'been', 'moments', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'groove', 'particular', 'step', 'combination', 'keep', 'doing', 'instead', 'moving', 'on.Tamilee', 'good', 'cueing', 'laid', 'back', 'motivating', 'being', 'girly', 'perky', 'DVD', 'Fit', 'Hits', 'break', 'out', 'song', 'not', 'much', 'have', 'Rock', 'Hard', 'Assets', 'DVD', 'lot', 'more', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'people', 'have', 'based', 'entire', 'judgement', 'workout', 'based', 'singing', 'chrissake', 'once', ""'ve"", 'got', 'moves', 'down', 'can', 'switch', 'music', 'only', 'version', 'much', 'breaking', 'out', 'song', 'contributes', 'laid-back-be-yourself-cut-loose-have-fun', 'atmosphere.The', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'complicated', 'Tamilee', 'very', 'well', 'difficult', 'moves', 'half', 'time', 'performing', 'move', 'tempo', 'can', 'do', 'mambo', 'toe-taps', 'pony', 'step-touch', 'then', 'can', 'do', 'workout', 'are', 'several', 'bits', 'workout', 'are', 'high', 'impact', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'can', 'modify', 'just', 'have', 'think', 'how', 'modify', 'workout', 'more', 'high', 'impact', 'segments', 'Rock', 'Hard', 'Assets', ""'d"", 'consider', 'be', 'slightly', 'more', 'difficult', 'two.Now', 'here', 'are', 'songs', 'order', 'appearance:1', 'Signed', 'Sealed', 'Delivered', 'Warmup', '2', 'Sugar', 'Pie', 'Honey', 'Bunch3', 'Nowhere', 'Run4', 'Uptight5', 'Old', 'Heart', 'Mine6', 'Heard', 'Grapevine', 'Cooldown', 'Now', 'things', 'DVD', 'common', 'Fit', 'Hits', 'workouts', 'Why', 'exercisers', 'DVD', 'wear', 'school-girl', 'theatre', 'costumes', 'Perhaps', 'try', 'contribute', 'relaxed', 'atmosphere', 'Tamilee', 'attitude', 'really', 'look', 'bit', 'place', 'workout', 'personally', 'prefer', 'streamlined', 'appearance', 'exercisers', 'workouts', 'something', 'producers', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'recent', 'DVDs', 'have', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'Personal', 'Training', 'System', 'Blast', 'Away', 'Pounds', 'Burn', 'Fat', 'Fast', 'Power', 'Zone', 'Ultimate', 'Metabolism', 'Boosting', 'Workout', 'other', 'thing', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'impressed', '4min', 'Natural', 'Journeys', 'advert', 'workout', 'way', 'skip', 'over', 'fast-forward', 'advert', 'quite', 'frustrating', 'have', 'Natural', 'Journey', 'more', 'recent', 'DVDs', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', '20min', 'Yoga', 'Makeovers', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'Yoga', 'Beauty', 'series', 'have', 'changed', 'prdocution', 'can', 'fast', 'forward', 'advert', 'shame', 'not', 'possible', 'DVD', 'though.A', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'cardio', 'Tamilee', 'toning', 'workouts', 'want', 'body', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'know', 'Fit', 'Hits', 'DVDs', 'bonus', 'cardio', 'workout', 'want', 'body', 'series', 'Motown', 'Moves', 'Cardio', '1', 'Segment', 'want', 'body', 'yet', 'Tamilee', 'primarily', 'toning', 'movements', 'one', 'set', 'weights', 'mat', 'such', 'pace', 'cardio', 'heart', 'rate', 'workout', '15mins', 'long', 'other', 'workouts', 'want', 'body', 'series.Summary', 'Fun', 'dancy', 'cardio', 'steps', 'not', 'too', 'difficult-', 'Good', 'cueing-', 'Occasional', 'breaks', 'out', 'song', 'bad', 'clothes-', 'Good', 'extras-', 'Good', 'music']",N/A
