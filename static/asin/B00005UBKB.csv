That is until he finds out that living with these hotties will probably land him in traction for the rest of his youth.  If only I could be him, how much more of a man... uh, never mind.Love Hina takes the viewer on a predictable, comedy driven ride through the lives of young anime characters.  Like the cover suggests, the boy represses his manly side to please the egoes of his feminine housemates.  He's punched, pulled, thrown, kicked, screamed at, sword attacked, and ridiculed.  Through it all, he apologizes profusely, and dorks it up good.The animation, soundtrack, and pace make this anime a little amateurish and rough, but that veneer wears off pretty quickly.  Underneath the forementioned cons, lie some pretty good pros.  The struggle to find success in school, the embarasment of enfatuative discovery, and the drive to keep promises make this show a lot more than it seems.  First impressions don't always pan out I guess.Start collecting these DVD's.  Buy them in the collectors box, it's only a little more money.

Love Hina has since become my favorite anime series of all time. Part of it is that I am partial to this type of series (one guy with many pretty girls) but Love Hina goes a step further. The girls' characters eventually develop quite a bit and you learn some of the reasons they act the way they do. Also, there is lots of humor, including Kaolla at the controls of a fleet of (fully functional) miniature tanks in the first episode.This series starts off good, and it will only get better as the series proceeds.

683848,A28RFOF6EY42F4,B00005UBKB,"""asu-san""","[8, 8]","Like many anime TV sereies, Love Hina has it's roots in comics. The TV sreies consisted of 27 episodes, including a Christmas Special.It's a romantic, comedy with a straight forward storyline. A 20 year old, Tokyo U student wanna-be (Keitrao) ends up as the manager of an all girls dorm in a small town, Hinata. The reaction of the girls isn't exactly good, and the tension between the residents and Keitaro makes for funny situations. Add in the fact that Keitaro has been without a ""girl"" friend since he was 5, and you find a bumbling naive boy being overrun by the girls. (In some ways, it's remeniscent of the Tenchi Muyo! storylines.)The main female character is Naru, also trying to get into Tokyo U, and it seems her main task is to beat Keitaro to a pulp by the end of the series and be his main love interest. The other main characters are: Kitsune, a girl focused on parties and money; Motoko, a sword master; Su, a techologically inclined exchange student; and Shinobu, shy but a good cook (also the most popular character in Japan).The animation is excellent, clear even when viewed frame by frame. The problem arises in the English dub. First, the sound is noticeably softer than the Japanese track. Second, the characters voices aren't what you'd expect. No matter how hard I try, there's no way Kitsune would have a southern accent. Third, on some DVD players, the subtitles come up and disappear late.My opinion, if you are looking for a laugh, this sereies will likely be a good buy.

683850,A2V026TK7H80V3,B00005UBKB,Carl Cheng,"[27, 29]","Love Hina, surprisingly very well-known among all anime fans, has finally made its way here to America. A series spanning 14 manga volumes, 24 episodes, 2 specials, 1 oav (episode 25), and the soon to be released in Japan, Love Hina Again (3 episode OAV).The series stars a helpless 20 year old ronin (a person who didn't pass the college exams) named Keitarou Urashima. Throughout high school, he never got really good grades and never had a girl friend, yet one of his earliest childhood memories was of a girl. The memory was very vague but he remembered that they made a promise to go to Tokyo University together because if two people in love get accepted, they will be definitely be happy forever. His whole reason for going to Tokyo University was for that promise and the only girl he really loved even thought he doesn't even remember who she was. Well in the present day, Keitarou decided he needed to get out of the house so he decides to go to his grandmother's Hinata Inn which to his surprise is now a female dormitory. This starts his lucky life with many beautiful women and possibly, one of them could be the girl he made the promise to.The packaging of this DVD frankly turns me off. If I had never seen Love Hina or had never heard about it and just saw it on the rack, I probably would not buy it. The logo Bandai made up looks really ancient and something from the 70s or something. The pose and expression of Keitarou and Naru on the cover of the DVD does not suit them. While they do this for the comical scenes and where they are annoyed with each other, the way they are remembered by fans is the subtle naivety of their feelings for each other which was expressed in the Japanese DVD covers which I hoped that Bandai would use or something to that effect. For this reason, I made my own DVD cover as a replacement. The DVD Series Box that comes with this DVD looks okay. I wouldn't say it was as special as the Cowboy Bebop box. The Japanese DVD Box used manga art which I didn't think fit too well so by using the anime art for the english box was a good idea.The music of this anime is amazing as well. The opening and ending are performed by Megumi Hayashibara who plays the role of Haruka Urashima (Keitarou's Aunt). They put in song what the series about: both the comedic and dramatic appeal. Some of the BGMs are amazing and even all the voice actors lend a hand to create some character vocals that do get shown in the anime.Love Hina is an anime that isn't necessarily for everyone. It deals with minor perversion multiple times but never really shows any nudity. So if you're a person that knows they are offended by this, then this anime might not be for you. To me, what makes this anime special is the fact that it gives me a light-hearted feeling after I finish watching each episode. Each character has his/her own depth that you can relate to. It's humorous, sorrowful, dramatic, all at the same time. Ken Akamatsu (Creater of Love Hina manga) made perfect characters and an amazing story as well.

Why does he want to get in when he's already failed twice? Well, when Keitarou was little, he made a promise to a little girl that they would meet and fall in love at Toudai. Unfortunately, she moved away and Keitarou doesn't even remember her name! So, out embarks Keitarou to fulfill his promise.One day, his grandmother leaves her inn, Hinata-sou, in the hands of Keitarou as a caretaker. Keitarou is astonished when he finds out that it is an all-girl's dorm! He meets a cast of wacky and fun girls that inhabit the rooms of Hinata-sou.

As the adventures unfold at Hinata-sou, it gets better. The opening sequence and song is extremely good, and I'm not sure, but I heard that Love Hina uses digital animation.

683852,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005UBKB,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[3, 5]","How does a second-time prep school reject aspiring to enter Tokyo University become the manager of an all-girl's dorm?  Well, it helps if his grandmother decides to go off on a trip and outright asks him.  Two, as there's no manager lined up, the dorm would close, and the girls would have to leave.  However, due to a mixture of sheer clumsiness, misunderstandings, and being at the wrong place at the wrong time, the tenants there give Keitaro Urashima grief after grief.  On his first day, still thinking the dorm is an old hotel and NOT a dorm, he accidentally enters the girls' bath, runs off with a laundry basket with some women's undies still in them, and gets attacked by some large mechanical toys built by a precocious exchange student.  Welcome to Love Hina, based on the manga series by Ken Akamatsu (Negima!).Keitaro's tenants think he is at the prestigious Tokyo U, and are impressed.  Their learning of the truth later doesn't get him into that much hot water than in the manga though.  The long-haired Naru Narusegawa, who also happens to be at the same prep school and is also trying to get into Todai, takes some sympathy on him.  The rest of the time, she is delivering him punches that literally sends him flying through the air to the other end of town.  The sheer ridiculousness of this is highlighted at one point, when she aims a punch at him from the balcony below, and he screams out ""how did that punch connect?"" as he's making another crosstown flight.Mitsune Konno, a.k.a. Kitsune.  That latter is her nickname and means ""fox"" in Japanese.  She has a tough and husky Osakan accent, kind of like a gangster's moll.  Then there's dark-skinned Kaolla Su.  Although we're never given her country of origin, it must be India, as she has a red dot on her forehead, loves superspicy foods, and in one of the mangas, we find out one of her coins has an elephant on it.  The energetic, karate-kicking, mechanical toy inventor of the bunch, she has a bratty voice and just wants someone to play with her.Two of the episodes help to introduce characters into the action.  2-year old Shinobu Maehara is cute and shy, and initially depressed.  Her parents have divorced and she is the pawn in a custody battle.  She meets the rest of the gang when she stops off to return Keitaro's sketchbook, and the rest is history.  Yet in the manga, she is already a tenant when Keitaro arrives, so a variation there.The other is Motoko Aoyama.  Dressed in an outfit similar to Kikyo in Inuyasha, she is by far the most ferocious of the tenants coming from a long generation of sword fighters, her fantastic skills earning her a kendo mastership at the age of 15.  So deadly is her swordplay, that she can create a vortex of wind with a swish of her blade.  She gets mad over wrongly created conclusions, which isn't good for Keitaro, and at one time, challenges him for the managership.As books become movies, manga gets turned into animes, and there are variations.  One is that Naru's character is more sympathetic to Keitaro than the manga, where she is downright vicious.  Another is the appearance of the three town elders, three men dressed in monk's robes who pop up to voice commentary relevant to the situation or person onhand.What may also be interesting is that Megumi Hayashibara, who sings the insanely cheery and rapid-fire opening theme song, voices the laid back Aunt Haruka. Hayashibara also did the theme song and voiced the title character of a certain All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl.  On another voice, Azumanga Daioh fans may recognize the voice of Yu Asakawa, who did the voice of the tall, long-haired, and shy cat-lover Sakaki.  Here, she does Motoko.Good start to the series.",4,First four episodes based on Ken Akamatsu's manga,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,3706,"['How', 'second-time', 'prep', 'school', 'reject', 'aspiring', 'enter', 'Tokyo', 'University', 'become', 'manager', 'all-girl', 'dorm', 'Well', 'grandmother', 'go', 'off', 'trip', 'outright', 'asks', 'Two', 'manager', 'lined', 'up', 'dorm', 'would', 'close', 'girls', 'would', 'have', 'leave', 'However', 'due', 'mixture', 'sheer', 'clumsiness', 'misunderstandings', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'tenants', 'there', 'give', 'Keitaro', 'Urashima', 'grief', 'grief', 'first', 'day', 'still', 'thinking', 'dorm', 'old', 'hotel', 'NOT', 'dorm', 'accidentally', 'girls', 'bath', 'laundry', 'basket', 'women', 'undies', 'still', 'attacked', 'large', 'mechanical', 'toys', 'built', 'precocious', 'exchange', 'student', 'Welcome', 'Love', 'Hina', 'based', 'manga', 'series', 'Ken', 'Akamatsu', 'Negima', '.Keitaro', 'tenants', 'think', 'prestigious', 'Tokyo', 'U', 'are', 'impressed', 'learning', 'truth', 'later', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'hot', 'water', 'manga', 'long-haired', 'Naru', 'Narusegawa', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'same', 'prep', 'school', 'also', 'trying', 'get', 'Todai', 'sympathy', 'rest', 'time', 'delivering', 'punches', 'literally', 'flying', 'air', 'other', 'end', 'town', 'sheer', 'ridiculousness', 'highlighted', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'punch', 'balcony', 'out', 'how', 'did', 'punch', 'connect', 'making', 'crosstown', 'flight.Mitsune', 'Konno', 'a.k.a', 'Kitsune', 'latter', 'nickname', 'fox', 'Japanese', 'tough', 'husky', 'Osakan', 'accent', 'kind', 'gangster', 'moll', 'Then', 'dark-skinned', 'Kaolla', 'Su', ""'re"", 'never', 'given', 'country', 'origin', 'must', 'be', 'India', 'red', 'dot', 'forehead', 'superspicy', 'foods', 'one', 'mangas', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'coins', 'elephant', 'energetic', 'karate-kicking', 'mechanical', 'toy', 'inventor', 'bunch', 'bratty', 'voice', 'just', 'someone', 'play', 'her.Two', 'episodes', 'help', 'introduce', 'characters', 'action', '2-year', 'old', 'Shinobu', 'Maehara', 'cute', 'shy', 'initially', 'depressed', 'parents', 'have', 'divorced', 'pawn', 'custody', 'battle', 'rest', 'gang', 'when', 'stops', 'off', 'return', 'Keitaro', 'sketchbook', 'rest', 'history', 'manga', 'already', 'tenant', 'when', 'Keitaro', 'variation', 'there.The', 'other', 'Motoko', 'Aoyama', 'Dressed', 'outfit', 'similar', 'Kikyo', 'Inuyasha', 'far', 'most', 'ferocious', 'tenants', 'coming', 'long', 'generation', 'sword', 'fighters', 'fantastic', 'skills', 'earning', 'kendo', 'mastership', 'age', '15', 'So', 'deadly', 'swordplay', 'can', 'create', 'vortex', 'wind', 'swish', 'blade', 'mad', 'wrongly', 'created', 'conclusions', ""n't"", 'good', 'Keitaro', 'one', 'time', 'managership.As', 'books', 'become', 'movies', 'manga', 'turned', 'animes', 'are', 'variations', 'One', 'Naru', 'character', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Keitaro', 'manga', 'where', 'downright', 'vicious', 'appearance', 'three', 'town', 'elders', 'three', 'men', 'dressed', 'monk', 'robes', 'who', 'pop', 'up', 'voice', 'commentary', 'relevant', 'situation', 'person', 'onhand.What', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'interesting', 'Megumi', 'Hayashibara', 'who', 'insanely', 'cheery', 'rapid-fire', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'laid', 'back', 'Aunt', 'Haruka', 'Hayashibara', 'also', 'did', 'theme', 'song', 'voiced', 'title', 'character', 'certain', 'All', 'Purpose', 'Cultural', 'Cat', 'Girl', 'voice', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'fans', 'may', 'recognize', 'voice', 'Yu', 'Asakawa', 'who', 'did', 'voice', 'tall', 'long-haired', 'shy', 'cat-lover', 'Sakaki', 'Here', 'Motoko.Good', 'start', 'series']",N/A

Later on his grandma invites him to go to the hot springs and little did he know that it was a all girls dorm. Since he arrived his grandma left him in charge and now he is the owner of the Hinata Apartments. Later on he realizes that one of the girls that lives in the dorms might be the little girl that he made his promise to and now he is out to find out.

Although many critics of the romantic-comedy genre will complain that it is too cute, I really like it.  Every episode has the residents of the Hinata-sou involved in some wacky adventure, and yet the show manages to remain somewhat anchored in reality.  The only really unsatisfactory character is Suu-chan.  The technically adept bare-footed young girl character is a really worn and tired concept(She reminds me of Ed from Bebop, only with better speech).  The artwork and animation are not be missed by any fan of anime!  Whether you like the story or not, Rabu Hina has some of the best artwork and animation I have ever seen animated, period.  It was totally made digitally, and yet does not support a computer generated work, which means that the animation is not only fluid, but very lifelike while mainting the overall cartoonish feel.  The only part that isn't good is the dub, especially Kitsune-chan's dub.  Why they gave her a southern accent is beyond me, but since the Japanese voices are absolutely astounding anyhow, I would recommend that you go subtitled anyway(or better yet, learn nihon go (Japanese)) and watch it with no subtitles!)

Only, he can't remember who the girl is. His grandmother Hina Urashima is leaving the Hinata Apartments, and has chosen Keitaro to be the new manager. When he arrives, he hops into the hotsprings bath. He is surprised when he finds out that he went into the women's bath, and that it was an all-girl dormitory. The girls cannot accept them as the new manager.Episode 2-7th grader Shinobu Maehara's always getting picked on at school, and her parents are going to get divorced, which will mean Shinobu will have to move away. But she doesn't want to. Earlier in episode 1, Keitaro was drawing her, when he dropped his sketchbook, and Shinobu tries to return it to him. She becomes acquainted with everyone, and they invite her to a good-bye party. Unfortunatley, she ends up doing all the work. When her parents come looking for her, they find out she wants to stay at the Hinata Apartments, so she does.Episode 3-Motoko Aoyama returns from her long retreat, and mistakes Keitaro as a stalker.

683860,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B00005UBKB,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[9, 14]","Hapless, accident-prone Keitaro makes a promise to a girl fifteen years ago that he and she will both attend Tokyo U &quot;and live happily ever after.&quot;  Keitaro fails to get in and ends up (amazingly!) becoming the janitor of an all-girls dorm.  And he's surrounded by a quintet of beautiful women -- including mischief-making Su Koalla, shy but sweet Shinobu Maebara, man-hating Ninja Motoko Aoyama, fun-loving Mitsune &quot;Kitsune&quot; Kanno, and brainy but incredibly short-tempered and impossibly violent (not to mention outrageously bitchy) Naru Nagesawa.  Of all these females (who occasionally treat him like a punching bag -- namely Naru and Motoko), Keitaro thinks that he may find his long-lost sweetheart in Naru, who also made a promise to someone at Tokyo U.  Keitaro spends much of the time throughout the series getting physically abused, falsely accused, making mistakes (all quite by accident) that require him begging for mercy, and all other sorts of painful torture before he finally gets the girl (or does he?).If the above sounds silly and uninspired, it is.  But this isn't alone what drags LOVE HINA down.  The show, based on a popular manga by Ken Akamitsu, is a collection of cliches all grossly exaggerated in an attempt to be funny -- multi-faceted, hysterical nutcases, klutzy guys, irrational behaviors -- and on some levels it works but on many others it flops.Some episodes are entertaining:  one of them is a parody on the ever-popular Japanese RPG series DRAGON QUEST while two others are a music video episode and a stage play that (literally!) brings down the house as well as much of the stage.  And there are some likable characters, mainly Shinobu, a sweet, shy, sensitive doll who would (ideally!) be the right catch for Keitaro.  The artwork is beautiful -- entirely created digitally, resulting in some spectacular shots, including fireworks, rippling waters, and many more.Unfortunately, these benefits all seemed dragged down by a number of flaws that are appallingly too grating to ignore.  Some of the gags are forced and may not translate well with others.  And some episodes are less interesting than others; I actually found myself pulling away from it by the end of Volume 4, watching the last episodes only in bits and pieces.  But the most offensive drawback of all is that the characters express dispicably stupid behavior -- how am I supposed to believe that Naru secretly loves Keitaro when all she does is violently assault him, badmouth him, get jealous when he tries to be nice to someone else, and nasty to him when he is trying to be good to her?  And how can Keitaro possibly survive all the nasty assaults and still have to be responsible for EVERYTHING everyone gets upset about?  So much of this is thrown at us, that LOVE HINA actually becomes more infuriating to watch rather than funny.I understand LOVE HINA has its fans, but I didn't find the show as entertaining as I would have liked.  Even the ending was a groaner.  I did enjoy some parts of the show, but it's not one I would consider myself getting for keeps.  I'd suggest renting it just one time before making any decisions.The DVD presentation, meanwhile, is exceptional.  The video quality is pristine and clear, and, on Volumes 3 and 4, there are behind-the-scenes videos -- an interview with the show's director and the other with the dubbing crew --.  The dub is a mixed bag; it's lower mixed than the Japanese language track, and some of the voices are obnoxious and grating:  do they REALLY have to sound so high-pitched and squeaky?

If you're looking for a ""loser guy is surrounded by tons of beautiful women who beat the stuffing out of him on a daily basis but secretly think he's a good guy"" series, then you have found the perfect match.Poor Keitaro is an everyman, a somewhat loveable loser who finds himself in the situation of his dreams - living with gorgeous girls - only to have the worst luck around them, ending up in situations that make him look like a huge pervert. Keitaro falls in love with one girl, Naru Narusegawa, who loves nothing more than to kick him into orbit every five minutes. The entire point of the series is to see if Keitaro can get Naru to return his affections.I admit that I did enjoy some of the series, notably the one where Keitaro dreams the girls into a video game, and one or two of the ""Motoko the Kendo-Girl isn't so mean as she seems"" shows. However, the number of mindless filler episodes far outnumbers the good ones, and even when the show attempts to convey that Keitaro is Feeling Deep Emotions and You Should Sympathize With Him, I mostly found myself yawning and wishing the show would develop some substance (or at least some unrelated to the chest size of the Hinata Sou girls).If you like eye candy in the form of teenage girls, or think the same stunt repeated ad infinitem (namely one or all of the girls attacking Keitaro every ten seconds) is amusing, you'll probably enjoy this series.

This series has a substantial amount of charm, and I truly believe that that is a good thing. However, there are a few problems.The story revolves around Keitaro Urashima, a twenty year old man with a mission; to get into Tokyo University to fulfill a promise made to the only girl who ever liked him, so that they can magically live happily ever after(huh???) Unfortunately, he's a sub par student and now under increasing pressure to give up his dream and get a job. However, due to the retirement of his grandmother, he finds himself left as apartment manger of an all girl dormitory, which solves his need for a job, but complicates everything else.If this setup seems all too familiar, that's because it is; very typical fish out of water stuff. That said, I really kind of like Keitaro and the girls. These characters are interesting, if a bit stereotypical. What I found less attractive are the little things.One finds out quite early that our hero has an active fantasy life. Unfortunately, it intrudes so often that it really interferes with the flow of the story. Also, as one can imagine with one guy and five girls, there are misunderstandings and a bit of violence. The thing here is that the violence is so exaggerated, it makes Looney Tunes look tame in comparison. That would be more of a problem, except that when one watches some of the goofy things that our hero does in the course of the day, you almost want to hit him yourself. I mean, there's a difference between being naive and being a total nut.What is left in the end is an interesting, if somewhat silly story that has at least a certain amount of promise. This story has nice moments, when people see eye to eye, and opinions change. But make no mistake, this aint Shakespeare. That said, I think there's something worth getting here.

683869,A1DUIWDZCNJIHA,B00005UBKB,"Slade Simon ""slade37""","[5, 6]","I have only read the bilingual Japanese editions of Love Hina so my comparisons will be dealing with that translation of the manga. I've only read through chapter 16 (Volume 3).Keitaro is a 20 year-old guy struggling to get into college. He keeps failing entrance exams. He collects photo booth pictures of himself alone since he has never had a girl-friend. The only girl to ever like him was someone he hasn't seen since he was about 5 years old. Back then, they made a promise to go to Tokyo Univerisity together. It's believed that any couple that goes to Tokyo U. together will live happily ever after. Even though Keitaro can't even remember her name, he's still trying to get into the university in the hopes of seeing the girl from his past again.The animation for this series was done on computers. (There's a featurette in a later volume.) Some people may not care for that - preferring true cel animation. I don't mind it.The DVD has four episodes.&quot;All-girls Dorm with Outdoor Bath: Hot Spring&quot; has Keitaro moving into the dorm.&quot;The Hinata's New Resident, Shinobu: Arrow Signs&quot;: Shinobu's parents are getting a divorce and forcing her to move away with her mom. She doesn't want to leave.&quot;Kendo Girl in Love?: Swordplay&quot;: Motoko thinks she might be in love with Keitaro.&quot;The Tokyo U Promise From 15 Years Ago: Diary&quot;: Keitaro falls against a shelf in Naru's room causing her diary to fall and open to a page mentioning a promise from 15 years ago. That's all he could read before Naru shows up. Keitaro begins to wonder if Naru is the girl from his past.With no pun intended, the anime series is a very cartoonish version of the manga. The manga may have insane moments, but it remains somewhat realistic. Naru may sometimes send Keitaro flying across the room but not a few miles through the sky like in the opening titles of the anime. Based on what I've read so far, Su doesn't have all of the neat toys in the manga. However, she is energetic and may knock Keitaro around a bit. In the anime, there are insane chase scenes through the hallways of the apartments (sometimes with explosions) that do not exist in the original manga.As with most anime adaptations, there are some basic plots that appear in both versions, but the presentation is rarely the same. There are differences in the stories that are presented in both formats. I don't mind that. Later in the series, I think things get a little too insane but still not too bad. The truly insane bits don't show up in the parts of the manga I have read. True fans may want to stick with the complete anime series anyway.

683870,A2Y1D9287MGNQ4,B00005UBKB,Steven Myers,"[2, 2]","Love Hina is another entrant in the anime category of wimpy guy surrounded by girls.  Fortunately, it's a very good entrant.  The wimpy guy here is Keitaro, who has tried and failed to enter Tokyo University the past two years.  His parents are sick of supporting him, and his grandmother and aunt rope him into managing an apartment of girls.  Hijinks ensue, typically involving accidentally finding the girls in compromising situations or inadvertant touching.  Keitaro suffers regularly at the hands of the girls, but it's so over the top and silly that it works.  Also, Keitaro is not the total loser: he's loyal, kind-hearted, and a talented artist, and struggles for his dream of Tokyo U.The production quality here is extremely high: the animation is nice, the colors are clear.  The only problem is that the English dub is recorded at a very low level; in particular, the opening theme is almost inaudible on the first episode, but does pick up on later episodes.  The dialogue and such is always audible, just quiet.  The English casting is not perfect, but only in the sense I just don't think the voice actress for Naru (the female lead) fits (she does a good job, but sounds wrong).  Another of the girls has a pseudo-Southern accent, which sounds as fake as it is, but it never becomes grating.I purchased disc 1 with the series box, which will hold all the forthcoming DVDs.  It's a solid, if not spectacular box: hard cardboard with some nice images of the cast.  It's an open-sided box, where the DVDs just slide in and their spines show.  Definately worth the extra couple of bucks if it's still available when you buy.",5,"Over-the-top Silly, Romantic Comedy",1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,1636,"['Love', 'Hina', 'entrant', 'anime', 'category', 'wimpy', 'guy', 'surrounded', 'girls', 'Fortunately', 'very', 'good', 'entrant', 'wimpy', 'guy', 'here', 'Keitaro', 'who', 'tried', 'failed', 'enter', 'Tokyo', 'University', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'parents', 'are', 'sick', 'supporting', 'grandmother', 'aunt', 'rope', 'managing', 'apartment', 'girls', 'Hijinks', 'ensue', 'typically', 'involving', 'accidentally', 'finding', 'girls', 'compromising', 'situations', 'inadvertant', 'touching', 'Keitaro', 'regularly', 'hands', 'girls', 'so', 'top', 'silly', 'Also', 'Keitaro', 'not', 'total', 'loser', 'loyal', 'kind-hearted', 'talented', 'artist', 'struggles', 'dream', 'Tokyo', 'U.The', 'production', 'quality', 'here', 'extremely', 'high', 'animation', 'nice', 'colors', 'are', 'clear', 'only', 'problem', 'English', 'dub', 'recorded', 'very', 'low', 'level', 'particular', 'opening', 'theme', 'almost', 'inaudible', 'first', 'episode', 'pick', 'up', 'later', 'episodes', 'dialogue', 'such', 'always', 'audible', 'just', 'quiet', 'English', 'casting', 'not', 'perfect', 'only', 'sense', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'voice', 'actress', 'Naru', 'female', 'lead', 'good', 'job', 'wrong', 'girls', 'pseudo-Southern', 'accent', 'as', 'fake', 'never', 'grating.I', 'purchased', 'disc', '1', 'series', 'box', 'will', 'hold', 'forthcoming', 'DVDs', 'solid', 'not', 'spectacular', 'box', 'hard', 'cardboard', 'nice', 'images', 'cast', 'open-sided', 'box', 'where', 'DVDs', 'just', 'slide', 'spines', 'show', 'Definately', 'extra', 'couple', 'bucks', 'still', 'available', 'when', 'buy']",N/A

It is the dream job for most teenage boys as he gets to live with lots of nice ladies - Naru, fox-woman Kitsune, Kaolla Su, and later Shinobu and Motoko, when she returns.

683873,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B00005UBKB,Zack Davisson,"[14, 15]","&quot;Love Hina&quot; is a brilliant anime series.  At first glance, it seems formulaic.  Narusagawa and Keitaro join the long line of shy college students who can't/won't express their feelings for each other.  &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; and &quot;Oh! My Goddess&quot; come to mind.  After a few episodes, the difference becomes clear, and &quot;Love Hina&quot; begins to shine.This anime is FUNNY.  It is funny on a level that other series do not approach.  &quot;Love Hina&quot; takes place in a women's dorm, Hinata Lodge.  The lodge is populated by a small group of beautiful girls, who are all misfits in their own way.  Motoko is a mystical Kendo warrior.  Suu is pretty much Radical Edward transplanted.  Narusagawa is trying hard for Tokyo University, and studies so hard she needs bottle thick glasses.  The male manager of the Hinata Lodge is Keitaro, a 3 time Ronin also trying for Tokyo University.  Hijinks ensue.  Underpants are accidentally displayed.  First kisses ALMOST happen. Keitaro is slapped, kicked and sent into orbit.  Classic Japanese anime slapstick.The animation is A+++. (A great episode involving Motoko takes place in the flickering, black and white style of old Samurai films.)  The characters all have distinct personalities and great character design.  I love the opening theme music.  I highly, highly highly recommend &quot;Love Hina.&quot;",5,Prepare yourself!
