Franklin ""Information Geek""","[2, 3]","As someone who has done some research using primary sources about sex appeal from an evolutionary approach, I found this video to be remarkably accurate and up to date (when it was made). I really like that it went to significant lengths to discuss the issues with the researchers who have actually done the empirical research. It presented the viewpoint and supporting research in a way that was both interesting and informative.  I use it in my undergrad human sexuality course to start discussion about this topic.It is not really a drawback, but this video really changes course in the last ten minutes.  It goes all humanistic to try to make the inherent determinism of the behavior genetics approach a little more palatable for general audiences.  It moves from research to philosophy. My classes seem to appreciate that, but it is a switch in direction at the end.Overall, it is an outstanding effort for something that was created for TV.",5,Interesting and accurate from the evolutionary perspective,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,946,"['someone', 'who', 'done', 'research', 'using', 'primary', 'sources', 'sex', 'appeal', 'evolutionary', 'approach', 'found', 'video', 'be', 'remarkably', 'accurate', 'up', 'date', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'really', 'went', 'significant', 'lengths', 'discuss', 'issues', 'researchers', 'who', 'have', 'actually', 'done', 'empirical', 'research', 'presented', 'viewpoint', 'supporting', 'research', 'way', 'was', 'interesting', 'informative', 'use', 'undergrad', 'human', 'sexuality', 'course', 'start', 'discussion', 'topic.It', 'not', 'really', 'drawback', 'video', 'really', 'course', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'all', 'humanistic', 'try', 'make', 'inherent', 'determinism', 'behavior', 'genetics', 'approach', 'little', 'more', 'palatable', 'general', 'audiences', 'research', 'philosophy', 'classes', 'seem', 'appreciate', 'switch', 'direction', 'end.Overall', 'outstanding', 'effort', 'something', 'was', 'created', 'TV']",The Science of Sex Appeal

We ingest useful chemicals (present in food, drink, oxygen from air) which are converted by our bodies (metabolized) to useful chemicals building cells, and causing our biological system to function.  We even have our own electrical plant in our brains which transmits electrical signals throughout our organism - our body.  Our waste disposal systems (gastro-intestinal, liver, kidneys, urinary tract) dispose of waste products.  And, very importantly, our reproductive system is programed to make us want (even need) to reproduce our species.  It is a biological necessity to do so.  This book very effectively tells the biochemistry which makes us (as well as others within our animal kingdom) want to/need to reproduce.  It is a very revealing analysis of the drives and desires which has caused the human species to grow and expand for the past 10,000 (+/-) years.
