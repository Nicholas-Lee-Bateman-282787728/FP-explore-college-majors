And yes, the results are mixed, but what he did that you almost don't see anymore, is to turn off the performer and try to get to the person behind the image, without trying to get them to emote. Entertainers, when they are not being entertaining, are surprisingly normal. Cavett can be a bit of a kiss up to his idols, but never doubt that his wheels are turning while the interviews go on. Some impressions:1) His love of Groucho made him blind to his faults as a guest, the inability to share the spotlight and a hectoring personality in old age. But, when Groucho was on, he was gold and he was mostly on during the first interview in the set.2) Woody Allen doesn't really talk to interviewers anymore, which is too bad, because his work with Cavett was awesome.3) I loved the Bob Hope interview because he wasn't funny, but was just having a normal conversation.4) Ditto the Jerry Lewis interview and as a general rule, I find Jerry Lewis pretty hard to take. Very smart guy, but you can tell that the critical drumming he received throughout his career really stung.5) The Lucille Ball interview wasn't that good, but that wasn't Cavett's fault. Lucy looked like she wanted to be anyplace else but the Cavett show.6) The Carol Burnett interview was nice, but not earth shattering.7) It's almost worth the price of the DVD alone to see Bill Cosby make Jack Benny crack up during the story about jazz drumming.Rumor has it that the next DVD's will be with Hollywood Stars and we can only hope that Cavett's incredible interviews with Katherine Hepburn and Orson Welles will be on that set",4,"Like the top review says, don't expect a ton of laughs",1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,1662,"['what', 'do', 'get', 'great', 'example', 'Cavett', 'interview', 'style', 'yes', 'results', 'are', 'mixed', 'what', 'did', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anymore', 'turn', 'off', 'performer', 'try', 'get', 'person', 'image', 'trying', 'get', 'emote', 'Entertainers', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'entertaining', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'normal', 'Cavett', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'kiss', 'up', 'idols', 'never', 'doubt', 'wheels', 'are', 'turning', 'interviews', 'go', 'impressions:1', 'love', 'Groucho', 'made', 'blind', 'faults', 'guest', 'inability', 'share', 'spotlight', 'hectoring', 'personality', 'old', 'age', 'when', 'Groucho', 'was', 'was', 'gold', 'was', 'mostly', 'first', 'interview', 'set.2', 'Woody', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'really', 'talk', 'interviewers', 'anymore', 'too', 'bad', 'work', 'Cavett', 'was', 'awesome.3', 'loved', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'interview', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'was', 'just', 'having', 'normal', 'conversation.4', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'interview', 'general', 'rule', 'find', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'pretty', 'hard', 'take', 'Very', 'smart', 'guy', 'can', 'tell', 'critical', 'drumming', 'received', 'career', 'really', 'stung.5', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'interview', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'Cavett', 'fault', 'Lucy', 'looked', 'wanted', 'be', 'anyplace', 'else', 'Cavett', 'show.6', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'interview', 'was', 'nice', 'not', 'earth', 'shattering.7', 'almost', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'see', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'make', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'crack', 'up', 'story', 'jazz', 'drumming.Rumor', 'next', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'Stars', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Cavett', 'incredible', 'interviews', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'will', 'be', 'set']",The Dick Cavett Show - Comic Legends
959834,A3BU6QT97HMF,B000CPH9Y8,Joseph Hart,"[10, 11]","The Amazon staff reviewer (correction:  the acerbic Amazon staff reviewer) is as opinionated as I am.  And I don't like his opinions.  I've watched both the actors and the comics on 2 of the Cavett sets.  I preferred the actors (except for comic standouts) because I became glutted on the humor.  And here's where Amazon and I part company.  The comics set was hilarious.  Hope (an older man) was subtle, with an infinite memory (for his own life), and got most of his zingers across with subtle expressions and gestures.  He talked funny too.  Groucho's interruptions of the Capote interview were negligible, particularly since Capote was given final billing and only on about 15 minutes.  Also Groucho did not rail against nudity in films.  He just said in his own way that too much exposure dulls your senses and he preferred the real thing.  He was lascivious and salacious and delightful.  Groucho a prude???  Lucy showed herself as she really is.  She was not particularly funny, nor did she try to be.  She cussed like a sailor and was arrogant and off-hand and insoucient and hard-knock wise and one of my favorite episodes.  It seemed to me (could easily be wrong) that her real personality (sans ""Lucy"" and a real shock) lost her the audience.  No great loss if so.  Woody Allen was the truly funny one, he and Bill Cosby, though I get tired of Cosby after a while, and his conceit.  Speaking of conceit.  Allen had it in truck loads during his first episode, then made a conscious effort to counteract it in his second.  I got the impression during his first episode that Cavett (who is witty himself) was actually competing with Allen for jokes, and it  brought out the best in him, they were both funny as hell.  I'm an Allen fan anyway.  I don't like Jerry Lewis.  Maybe a better way to say it is I don't like his humor.  I can cross my eyes.  That doesn't make me witty.  But those who do like Jerry Lewis might like his episode because he becomes quite (maudlin) personal and revealing.  I guess a little of his schtick punctuating an otherwise serious conversation is funny, relieves tension.  Carol Burnett was just a baby and soft and vulnerable and hilarious, this before she became hard and raw in her later years.  She and Cavett sang 2 duets.  The Smothers Brothers I thought were smug and clannish, Dick seemed affected and conscious of his image, Tom made a few jokes typical of him, but I was disappointed in the brothers, speaking as a big former fan.  Jack Benny was interesting, it was a shock to learn that Isaac Stern had asked him to take his place at a concert at the Met or somewhere equal.  He really can play.  (So can Woody Allen.)  I don't remember whether Benny was funny or not, I just remember that I enjoyed listening to him talk.  George Burns was a straight man, but still he got a lot of laughs, particularly (as on his radio show in the mid-forties) with his singing and with his jokes about his singing.  It was a delight to see the man behind those movies, Mel Brooks (a ""motor-mouth""? go eat a lemon), he was funny and creatve and as frenetic as a dozen Robin Williamses.  Finally, I liked Bob Hope better without a script that I ever did with one, and why doesn't Amazon hire someone with some sympathy toward their products to review them?  I sigh almost didn't buy this because of the Amazon staff reviewer's remarks.  I thought it was a great set, funny, tiresomely so, and I expect like the set with actors it will appreciate as time goes by.",5,Great,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,3496,"['Amazon', 'staff', 'reviewer', 'correction', 'acerbic', 'Amazon', 'staff', 'reviewer', 'as', 'opinionated', 'am', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'opinions', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'actors', 'comics', '2', 'Cavett', 'sets', 'preferred', 'actors', 'comic', 'standouts', 'became', 'glutted', 'humor', 'here', 'where', 'Amazon', 'part', 'company', 'comics', 'set', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Hope', 'older', 'man', 'was', 'subtle', 'infinite', 'memory', 'own', 'life', 'got', 'most', 'zingers', 'subtle', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'talked', 'funny', 'too', 'Groucho', 'interruptions', 'Capote', 'interview', 'were', 'negligible', 'particularly', 'Capote', 'was', 'given', 'final', 'billing', 'only', '15', 'minutes', 'Also', 'Groucho', 'did', 'not', 'rail', 'nudity', 'films', 'just', 'said', 'own', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'exposure', 'senses', 'preferred', 'real', 'thing', 'was', 'lascivious', 'salacious', 'delightful', 'Groucho', 'prude', 'Lucy', 'showed', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'funny', 'did', 'try', 'be', 'cussed', 'sailor', 'was', 'arrogant', 'off-hand', 'insoucient', 'hard-knock', 'wise', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'wrong', 'real', 'personality', 'Lucy', 'real', 'shock', 'lost', 'audience', 'great', 'loss', 'so', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'was', 'truly', 'funny', 'one', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'get', 'tired', 'Cosby', 'while', 'conceit', 'Speaking', 'conceit', 'Allen', 'had', 'truck', 'loads', 'first', 'episode', 'then', 'made', 'conscious', 'effort', 'counteract', 'second', 'got', 'impression', 'first', 'episode', 'Cavett', 'who', 'witty', 'was', 'actually', 'competing', 'Allen', 'jokes', 'brought', 'out', 'best', 'were', 'funny', 'hell', ""'m"", 'Allen', 'fan', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'Maybe', 'better', 'way', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'humor', 'can', 'cross', 'eyes', ""n't"", 'make', 'witty', 'who', 'do', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'might', 'like', 'episode', 'quite', 'maudlin', 'personal', 'revealing', 'guess', 'little', 'schtick', 'punctuating', 'otherwise', 'serious', 'conversation', 'funny', 'tension', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'was', 'just', 'baby', 'soft', 'vulnerable', 'hilarious', 'became', 'hard', 'raw', 'later', 'years', 'Cavett', 'sang', '2', 'duets', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'thought', 'were', 'smug', 'clannish', 'Dick', 'seemed', 'affected', 'conscious', 'image', 'Tom', 'made', 'few', 'jokes', 'typical', 'was', 'disappointed', 'brothers', 'speaking', 'big', 'former', 'fan', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'shock', 'learn', 'Isaac', 'Stern', 'had', 'asked', 'take', 'place', 'concert', 'Met', 'somewhere', 'equal', 'really', 'can', 'play', 'So', 'can', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Benny', 'was', 'funny', 'not', 'just', 'remember', 'enjoyed', 'listening', 'talk', 'George', 'Burns', 'was', 'straight', 'man', 'still', 'got', 'lot', 'laughs', 'particularly', 'radio', 'show', 'mid-forties', 'singing', 'jokes', 'singing', 'was', 'delight', 'see', 'man', 'movies', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'motor-mouth', 'go', 'eat', 'lemon', 'was', 'funny', 'creatve', 'as', 'frenetic', 'dozen', 'Robin', 'Williamses', 'Finally', 'liked', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'better', 'script', 'ever', 'did', 'one', 'why', ""n't"", 'Amazon', 'hire', 'someone', 'sympathy', 'products', 'review', 'sigh', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Amazon', 'staff', 'reviewer', 'remarks', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'set', 'funny', 'tiresomely', 'so', 'expect', 'set', 'actors', 'will', 'appreciate', 'time']",The Dick Cavett Show - Comic Legends

He grew on me slowly, seeming more than a bit reserved, dry and very, very intellectual. There was a seeming distance there, although he was affable enough.But as I watched his shows, I grew to enjoy them more. So it was intriguing to see that there was a collection focusing on his moments with comics, some of whom had the ability to draw Cavett out of his shell, to make his reserve less apparent. However, his session with Robin Williams was NOT one of those moments and that interview is still painful to watch, which probably explains why it isn't listed in this collection (Cavett actually appeared insulted by Williams, perhaps uneasy by the chaotic atmosphere that seemed to surround William when he was at his most impromptu).If you are one of those people who adores comics - including Groucho Marx, Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, and George Burns (all of them are interviewed in this collection) and have to see EVERYTHING they'd put on film, including appearances on talk shows, you might want to buy this. As a slice of tv history and culture, this is also revealing.Otherwise, I wouldn't advise buying this. In most of the sequences, the comics were wooden or awkward, like a fish out of water (with a few notable exceptions).Cavett had some wonderful shows but this collection doesn't show what I consider to be the best of them.",3,"A rare chance to see comics handle the Cavett format,....with mixed results",1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,1416,"[""'ll"", 'go', 'record', 'saying', 'was', 'not', 'instant', 'Cavett', 'fan', 'grew', 'slowly', 'seeming', 'more', 'bit', 'reserved', 'dry', 'very', 'very', 'intellectual', 'was', 'seeming', 'distance', 'there', 'was', 'affable', 'enough.But', 'watched', 'shows', 'grew', 'enjoy', 'more', 'was', 'intriguing', 'see', 'was', 'collection', 'focusing', 'moments', 'comics', 'whom', 'had', 'ability', 'draw', 'Cavett', 'shell', 'make', 'reserve', 'less', 'apparent', 'However', 'session', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'was', 'NOT', 'one', 'moments', 'interview', 'still', 'painful', 'watch', 'probably', 'why', ""n't"", 'listed', 'collection', 'Cavett', 'actually', 'appeared', 'insulted', 'Williams', 'perhaps', 'uneasy', 'chaotic', 'atmosphere', 'seemed', 'surround', 'William', 'when', 'was', 'most', 'impromptu', '.If', 'are', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'adores', 'comics', 'including', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'George', 'Burns', 'are', 'interviewed', 'collection', 'have', 'see', 'EVERYTHING', ""'d"", 'put', 'film', 'including', 'appearances', 'talk', 'shows', 'might', 'want', 'buy', 'slice', 'tv', 'history', 'culture', 'also', 'revealing.Otherwise', 'would', ""n't"", 'advise', 'buying', 'most', 'sequences', 'comics', 'were', 'wooden', 'awkward', 'fish', 'water', 'few', 'notable', 'exceptions', '.Cavett', 'had', 'wonderful', 'shows', 'collection', ""n't"", 'show', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'best']",The Dick Cavett Show - Comic Legends

i have these dvds because of the guest lists and luckily got them used and were dirt cheap (would never waste the dollars on a new set with Cavett 'trying' to host) but my goodness he is so inept at hosting i'm stunned!! even most of the guest seem bored to tears and one guest even asks in the middle of her segment something to the effect of 'are we done yet?' as she looks like she wants to be anywhere else than with this ego ridden host who clearly thinks hes witty and sly but the questions he comes up with are so bad!! one ex. is having the legend Lucille Ball on and i think if anyone knows Lucy, they know she thinks any kind of nudity in movies is distasteful and she doesnt approve (she refused to even see her own child Desi in his movie 'Joyride' because of this) so what does Cavett do? before Mrs Ball comes out he shows a clip of an early movie where 5 women including a young Lucy are chained and nude only covered by long wigs? then she comes out and he shows it again to her! what an idiot!! of course, she has grace and makes an uncomfortable moment bearable as that is her loving way but out of everything and anything Cavett could have showed or opened with thats what he goes with! another ex. is he asked the legend Jerry Lewis insightful questions as 'do you think you can tell something about someone by the way they light up a cigarette?' i mean you have Jerry Lewis and your going to ask that? luckily, some of the guest get to have the audience ask them questions which is so better than listening to the unprepared (i dont understand how as he always is looking at a stack of papers in front of him but then ask the inane questions). i mean there are so many moments of cringing silence like a deer in headlights that i can only watch a few minutes at a time. i fast forward thru Cavetts very flat openings of each show and monologues at the beginnings of each show (i cant believe he wrote some for Carson!) as he goes on n on with most of the audience silent at his attempts at humor that for the most part fall flat! so many of the intros he goes on n on about a guest, that i forget who he is introducing! if you want to see just how bad a job this 'host' does ck out the 'mel brooks' show where Cavett introduces the clip and doesnt even mention that the actor (not really) that is coming on that show had been arrested in a bank holdup and then killed (maybe) in jail just a few yrs after the show! i mean didnt he think we would b interested in that instead of his droll ideas about that show? and the show itself has even Mel Brooks say 'next question, youre dying here!!' and when the actor comes out, its so painfully bad to see this you think out of all the 'classic' shows in Cavetts mind, this is the one he picks to put on dvd? i dont know how Cavett was lucky enough to have these legends on this show (i dont know how long it ran) but he should count himself lucky to be sure!! so if you want to see some legends that sometimes just talk w/o the help of Cavett and when that happens its fun to watch but whenever Cavett is rambling and trying to be witty i would fast forward so you dont fall asleep!",1,would rate 5 stars for the guest and 1 star for Cavett!,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,3371,"['guests', 'legends', 'most', 'dvds', 'are', 'worth', 'see', 'many', 'are', 'not', 'anymore', 'i', 'only', 'wish', 'there', 'was', ""'prepared"", 'host', 'other', 'mind', 'numbing', 'put', 'sleep', 'Cavett', 'how', 'did', 'guy', 'ever', 'get', 'show', 'i', 'have', 'dvds', 'guest', 'lists', 'luckily', 'got', 'used', 'were', 'dirt', 'cheap', 'would', 'never', 'waste', 'dollars', 'new', 'set', 'Cavett', ""'trying"", 'host', 'goodness', 'so', 'inept', 'hosting', 'i', ""'m"", 'stunned', 'even', 'most', 'guest', 'seem', 'bored', 'tears', 'one', 'guest', 'even', 'middle', 'segment', 'something', 'effect', ""'are"", 'done', 'yet', 'be', 'anywhere', 'else', 'ego', 'host', 'who', 'clearly', 'hes', 'witty', 'sly', 'questions', 'up', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'one', 'ex', 'having', 'legend', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'i', 'think', 'anyone', 'Lucy', 'know', 'kind', 'nudity', 'movies', 'distasteful', 'approve', 'refused', 'even', 'see', 'own', 'child', 'Desi', 'movie', 'so', 'what', 'Cavett', 'do', 'Mrs', 'Ball', 'out', 'clip', 'early', 'movie', 'where', '5', 'women', 'including', 'young', 'Lucy', 'are', 'chained', 'nude', 'only', 'covered', 'long', 'wigs', 'then', 'out', 'again', 'what', 'idiot', 'course', 'grace', 'uncomfortable', 'moment', 'bearable', 'loving', 'way', 'everything', 'anything', 'Cavett', 'could', 'have', 'showed', 'opened', 'thats', 'what', 'ex', 'asked', 'legend', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'insightful', 'questions', ""'do"", 'think', 'can', 'tell', 'something', 'someone', 'way', 'light', 'up', 'cigarette', 'i', 'mean', 'have', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'going', 'ask', 'luckily', 'guest', 'get', 'have', 'audience', 'ask', 'questions', 'so', 'better', 'listening', 'unprepared', 'i', 'dont', 'understand', 'how', 'always', 'looking', 'stack', 'papers', 'front', 'then', 'ask', 'inane', 'questions', 'i', 'mean', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'cringing', 'silence', 'deer', 'headlights', 'i', 'can', 'only', 'watch', 'few', 'minutes', 'time', 'i', 'fast', 'forward', 'thru', 'Cavetts', 'very', 'flat', 'openings', 'show', 'monologues', 'beginnings', 'show', 'i', 'cant', 'believe', 'wrote', 'Carson', 'n', 'most', 'audience', 'silent', 'attempts', 'humor', 'most', 'part', 'fall', 'flat', 'so', 'many', 'intros', 'n', 'guest', 'i', 'forget', 'who', 'introducing', 'want', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'job', ""'host"", 'ck', 'out', ""'mel"", 'brooks', 'show', 'where', 'Cavett', 'clip', 'doesnt', 'even', 'mention', 'actor', 'not', 'really', 'coming', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'arrested', 'bank', 'holdup', 'then', 'killed', 'maybe', 'jail', 'just', 'few', 'yrs', 'show', 'i', 'mean', 'didnt', 'would', 'b', 'interested', 'instead', 'droll', 'ideas', 'show', 'show', 'even', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'say', ""'next"", 'question', 'youre', 'dying', 'here', 'when', 'actor', 'out', 'so', 'painfully', 'bad', 'see', 'think', ""'classic"", 'shows', 'Cavetts', 'mind', 'one', 'put', 'dvd', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'how', 'Cavett', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'legends', 'show', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'how', 'long', 'ran', 'should', 'count', 'lucky', 'be', 'sure', 'so', 'want', 'see', 'legends', 'sometimes', 'just', 'talk', 'help', 'Cavett', 'when', 'fun', 'watch', 'whenever', 'Cavett', 'rambling', 'trying', 'be', 'witty', 'i', 'would', 'fast', 'forward', 'dont', 'fall', 'asleep']",The Dick Cavett Show - Comic Legends

959840,A37S3ACL57LN62,B000CPH9Y8,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[2, 2]","Dick Cavett was a popular talk show host in the 1970s. His name has faded away through the years, but looking back on this DVD collection, one can see that his charm and personality have not faded through the changes in time. Although his guest were often classic stars, his interviews with them remain fresh and exciting to modern audiences. Here we have his vibrant and lovable style opposite such famous names as Woody Allen, Jack Benny, Bill Cosby, George Burns, The Smothers Brothers, and Jerry Lewis.Some of the standout interviews deserve some note. There are two appearances by the wacky and opinionated Groucho Marx, a man who agrees to sing some of the classic songs and reflect on his life in show business. As with many classic stars, he expresses distaste with ""modern"" film and feels that their shock value makes them trashy. He sports a silly golf cap with three round characters on top, a true testament to his outlandish personality.It is evident in Mel Brooks' appearance that the man loves to perform. It does not take much convincing to get him to get up and make a fool of himself. His bit on the show is rather short, but it is far from forgettable. At the end, he begins to get into an arguement with a censor which one wishes would have had more time.Lucille Ball is interviewed. Her episode is peppered with film clips ranging from an early appearance in Roman Scandals to a bit in I Love Lucy. For such a beloved comic star, she seems a bit haughty and short with Cavett, an easy going interviewer.Cavett was thrilled when Bob Hope appeared on the program. Hope was his idol as a young boy which is obvious by the way he is interviewed. Even for those who are not big Hope fans, it is hard not to enjoy this appearance. He is compliant, fun, informative, and interesting.Perhaps the most fun interview is that with Carol Burnett. She and Cavett seem to be similar in their love for classic films, sense of humor, and overall personality. Their similarities make them an excellent team to watch whether they are singing songs or engaging in small talk.Cavett opens each episode with a bit of commentary. It makes them all the more interesting to watch.",5,Forgotten Talk Show Host,1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,2177,"['Dick', 'Cavett', 'was', 'popular', 'talk', 'show', 'host', '1970s', 'name', 'faded', 'away', 'years', 'looking', 'back', 'DVD', 'collection', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'charm', 'personality', 'have', 'not', 'faded', 'changes', 'time', 'guest', 'were', 'often', 'classic', 'stars', 'interviews', 'remain', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'modern', 'audiences', 'Here', 'have', 'vibrant', 'lovable', 'style', 'opposite', 'such', 'famous', 'names', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'George', 'Burns', 'Smothers', 'Brothers', 'Jerry', 'Lewis.Some', 'standout', 'interviews', 'deserve', 'note', 'are', 'two', 'appearances', 'wacky', 'opinionated', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'man', 'who', 'sing', 'classic', 'songs', 'reflect', 'life', 'show', 'business', 'many', 'classic', 'stars', 'distaste', 'modern', 'film', 'feels', 'shock', 'value', 'trashy', 'sports', 'silly', 'golf', 'cap', 'three', 'round', 'characters', 'top', 'true', 'testament', 'outlandish', 'personality.It', 'evident', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'appearance', 'man', 'perform', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'convincing', 'get', 'get', 'up', 'make', 'fool', 'bit', 'show', 'rather', 'short', 'far', 'forgettable', 'end', 'get', 'arguement', 'censor', 'one', 'wishes', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'time.Lucille', 'Ball', 'interviewed', 'episode', 'peppered', 'film', 'clips', 'ranging', 'early', 'appearance', 'Roman', 'Scandals', 'bit', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'such', 'beloved', 'comic', 'star', 'bit', 'haughty', 'short', 'Cavett', 'easy', 'going', 'interviewer.Cavett', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'appeared', 'program', 'Hope', 'was', 'idol', 'young', 'boy', 'obvious', 'way', 'interviewed', 'Even', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'big', 'Hope', 'fans', 'hard', 'not', 'enjoy', 'appearance', 'compliant', 'fun', 'informative', 'most', 'fun', 'interview', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Cavett', 'seem', 'be', 'similar', 'love', 'classic', 'films', 'sense', 'humor', 'overall', 'personality', 'similarities', 'make', 'excellent', 'team', 'watch', 'are', 'singing', 'songs', 'engaging', 'small', 'talk.Cavett', 'episode', 'bit', 'commentary', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch']",The Dick Cavett Show - Comic Legends

I remember watching Cavett as a kid (sometimes I'd go to a taping as I live in NY) and these shows are wonderful. Unlike today's talk shows where a 'celebrity' shows up only to plug something and leave, Cavett had conversations. And this set brings us the likes of many beloved comedians, Groucho, Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Woody Allen, and many more. The transfer is beautiful, Cavett intros each show, which are complete and uncut. This is a must have set for anyone interested in a) classic TV, b) smart talk, c) real stars being themselves.  And the 4 disc set at these prices is a steal!",5,TV Legends Live again!
