If you have a friend of family member who loves SNL this is one of the best things to get them.

I had hoped that I would be able to see all the skits that I considered to be the best of the 09/10 season! I wasn't let down too bad! It did have some real great skits but nothing that I would call the best! I did enjoy the Betty White skits (see special features),  Garth & Kat on Weekend Update (see special features), and ""What up with that?"" - although the skit provided on the DVD was not the best ""What up with that?"" skit of the 09/10 season! Couldn't get enough of Stefon on Weekend Update (see special features)! I was starting to get tired of the Macgruber skits....but laughed out loud when Betty White told us about her muffins! Overall it was GREAT!! But I still wish I knew who gets to pick out the skits for these Best off DVD's???",5,Overall GREAT!!!,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,843,"['Well', 'sat', 'down', 'anticipation', 'was', 'ready', 'watch', 'DVD', 'excitement', 'was', 'building', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'skits', 'considered', 'be', 'best', '09/10', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'too', 'bad', 'did', 'have', 'real', 'great', 'skits', 'nothing', 'would', 'call', 'best', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Betty', 'White', 'skits', 'see', 'special', 'features', 'Garth', 'Kat', 'Weekend', 'Update', 'see', 'special', 'features', 'What', 'up', 'skit', 'provided', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'What', 'up', 'skit', '09/10', 'season', 'Could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Stefon', 'Weekend', 'Update', 'see', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'tired', 'Macgruber', 'skits', '.but', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'Betty', 'White', 'told', 'muffins', 'Overall', 'was', 'GREAT', 'still', 'wish', 'knew', 'who', 'pick', 'out', 'skits', 'Best', 'off', 'DVD']",N/A
