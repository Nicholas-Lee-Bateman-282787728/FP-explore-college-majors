One Week is an exception.This is a ""subtle"" film, the type you might watch and go ""What was the point of that?"" before it hits you later. (Sort of like a Canadian Elizabethtown.) It's also quintessentially Canadian, which likely means you'll either love it or hate it (Tim Hortons, hockey folklore, breathtaking scenery, whales and all).Much of the cinematography has a documentary feel. Most of the film appears to have been shot handheld, but it fits the story nicely without being obtrusive (in other words, you don't come away feeling like it was just shot handheld because the filmmakers couldn't afford a tripod). The folksy soundtrack and score are also very well-done.This isn't a blockbuster by any means, but it's a solid movie. Jackson is excellent, but Liane Balaban's supporting performance as Jackson's fiancee was a little week, IMHO. She wasn't really bad, she just didn't bring much life to her character whereas Jackson's character was easy to connect with.Canadian singer-songwriter Emm Gryner, on the other hand, is hard to take your eyes off of in her brief but important supporting role.If you're a Jackson fan or just tired of all the standard Hollywood flotsam, seek out this movie for a nice change of pace.",4,Josh Jackson's best work since Dawson's Creek,1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,1338,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'actor', 'most', 'movies', 'done', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'much', 'total', 'crap', 'One', 'Week', 'exception.This', 'subtle', 'film', 'type', 'might', 'watch', 'go', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'later', 'Sort', 'Canadian', 'Elizabethtown', 'also', 'quintessentially', 'Canadian', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Tim', 'Hortons', 'hockey', 'folklore', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'whales', '.Much', 'cinematography', 'documentary', 'feel', 'Most', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'handheld', 'story', 'nicely', 'being', 'obtrusive', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'was', 'just', 'shot', 'handheld', 'filmmakers', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'tripod', 'folksy', 'soundtrack', 'score', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'well-done.This', ""n't"", 'blockbuster', 'means', 'solid', 'movie', 'Jackson', 'excellent', 'Liane', 'Balaban', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Jackson', 'fiancee', 'was', 'little', 'week', 'IMHO', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'much', 'life', 'character', 'Jackson', 'character', 'was', 'easy', 'connect', 'with.Canadian', 'singer-songwriter', 'Emm', 'Gryner', 'other', 'hand', 'hard', 'take', 'eyes', 'brief', 'important', 'supporting', 'role.If', ""'re"", 'Jackson', 'fan', 'just', 'tired', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'flotsam', 'seek', 'out', 'movie', 'nice', 'change', 'pace']",One Week
1245693,A12EZUL89ERV86,B001YMDCE4,"C. Boucher ""CLB""","[3, 3]","People actually hate this movie? I find it charming, touching, filled with moments of introspection and wondering about the world around us. A closer reexamination of all we thought about ourselves and how life shaped us to think wrongly in a negative way about ourselves. I love how it shows the 4th grade teacher tearing up his musical gift because she had an ax to grind. And how the nurse just made the train because she power-walked and got on the train just before the one that was going to derail if she'd dawdled. We never know how our choices affect others in these ways.I love how the woman with the horse ranch is stirred by Ben's visit and it prompts her to go visit her son, which leads her to cross paths with the love of her life. There's a lot of ""good karma"" in this movie. I wish there really was a book because I'd surely read it.I've watched this movie again and again (Thank you, Netflix!) I love it and never grow tired of it. The soundtrack is perfect and it's just such a wonderful story of a young man faced with choices that would be next to impossible for anyone of his age to bear. He chose to take a drive, after reading ""Go west, young man"" on a coffee cup.I love even that detail of the film. He's a ""nihilist"" or agnostic but all through the film, you can see God's hand in his life. Leading him and causing him to stir things up in others who are also in His care.Don't listen to the bad reviews. I love this movie and I'll keep watching it. When it's no longer available on Netflix, I'll go ahead and buy it on Amazon or something. It really helped me to see how little difference there is between Americans and Canadians.Thank you, those who made the film, did such a great job acting in it, and those who performed the soundtrack.

My husband had experienced death, about 5 minutes, the week before at the hands of a local medical team when they flushed his electrolytes too low using IV Lasix.  Instead of coming clean and helping us move forward, the SSM staff seemingly teamed up in unison trying to persuade us it was his heart while trying to manipulate and coerce us into further medical ""intervention"" while cajoling us with their Fear Factor. When I was fighting to get him released, the electro physiologist assured me that I ""did not understand this is a matter of life and death"" then proceeded to inform me my husband ""will be dead within 2 weeks, probably a few days.""Instead I took my husband home, learned how to strengthen his heart naturally via following the supplement protocols in Sinatra Solution and we overhauled our lifestyle, together. Importantly we realized we only live once, we never know when the final day will be, so we began living in the moment. We also decided to remove ourselves from toxic people and organizations. We fired his doctors and medical staff.That incident was nearly FIVE years ago in MARCH 2008. I write this review as we are watching One Week, together, in August 2012. Not only have we reversed his heart disease, we cured his type 2 diabetes. All while living for the moment and NOT depriving him of his favorite meals.  We found the truth of the medical mafia and realized there are plenty of other options than what mainstream medicine has to offer.As the movie states, living in the moment , pursuing your dreams and doing what is right for the individual is what matters.  Following doctors with their toxic protocols that have a *guarantee* of serious adverse side effects is not for everyone.The question ""what would you do if you have one week to live?"" Is something we all should ask of ourselves - each and every week. Search for the moments.What WOULD you do if you have one week to live?Does treatment truly make sense?Does doing what everyone else wants- to be a patient- instead of fighting for life make sense?My friend is dieing of cancer; she's chosen mainstream medicine... and is miserable, is having complications from treatment of the complications of the treatment and overall is very miserable. It pains me greatly watching her daily blog of the trauma she is enduring to her body- even after the doctors have told her they do NOT have any treatment to cure her cancer nor to even extend her life.As the movie implies, simply....

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","A Canadian sleeper, ""One Week"" is a small, quiet, and thoughtful little film that I think will be a pleasant surprise to most.  A rather lightweight movie about mortality and making the most out of what we're given--the film, which might have been insufferably maudlin, is played for mostly comic affect.  It's an interesting, and mostly effective, choice because it is the tone of ""One Week"" which makes it stand out.  So low key and understated, at times, as to barely register--the piece eschews traditional big dramatic moments for a quirky introspection provided in a silky narrative by Campbell Scott.  At times, the film veers into overly precious territory and I'm not sure that it doesn't want to be a comic fable.  I think, however, it is more successful as an unassuming character piece as opposed to a hokey allegory.Joshua Jackson plays a young teacher who is diagnosed with a Stage 4 cancer.  With such a bleak prognosis, Jackson wants to reconnect with life before assuming the role of a patient.  Leaving his family and fiancee, Jackson embarks on a motorcycle adventure across Canada.  Along the way, as you might expect, Jackson learns how to live again--to embrace the side of him which had been relegated to the past in pursuit of adult responsibilities.  The trip is filled with colorful and wise locals, ridiculous tourist traps, and mildly amusing scenarios that all help to identify what Jackson holds precious.  As if that weren't enough, the Scott narrative observes the action and provides either a gently humorous punchline or an example of how a brief occurrence has lifelong repercussions.  I love Scott--but it is in this voice-over that ""One Week"" becomes slightly strained and contrived.The film is, also, a lovely tribute to the Canadian landscape.  A travelogue of wilderness beauty, the movie has a lot to recommend it visually.  But to anchor the scenario and keep you invested--there has to be a compelling lead.  Jackson is this movie.  I think that he underplays his role with precision, and his effortless likability is a huge selling point.  There is something incredibly natural about the way this film unfolds which makes me forgive its less successful narrative reaches.  As the film progresses, the tone becomes more serious as is appropriate.  But the overuse of melancholic music starts to supplant actual plotting.  Yes, it cues sadness--but it's too easy, especially for a film that has tried to establish a unique voice.  All in all, though, I think people will love this film and find everything else nitpicking.  So who am I to argue?  About 3 1/2 stars which I'll round up for good intentions.

Though it had a bit too much of that hipster/indie feel, they managed to best that hindrance by giving us a great story with a setting that is too beautiful for words. I would DEFINITELY recommend this to people who are into film that is made to question the things we not only take for granted, but also just assume we want due too society's standards.I'm not from Canada, nor have I ever been there, but after watching this movie, I really hope to some day get to experience all the scenic beauty of it. I would even myself like to do it by motorcycle.I read most of the critiques people had AGAINST this film, and I'm not sure any of them actually held the merit of the film accountable. So far, the majority of complaints have been about the fact that some American actors were used. If that type of thing bothers you, then you must not understand the actual concept of acting and probably should just quit watching movies altogether. Another complaint has been that their was too much narration. I personally found that the narration added a unique dimension of flat humor and brought a quality of storytelling that allowed me to help relate more to Joshua Jackson's portrayal of the main character.As I stated in the beginning, the only real deficit to this film was the hipster/indie feel. They tried to sometimes fit in poorer quality handheld shots and rough transitions to give it a bit more of an edgy touch, but it wasn't necessary as it drew away, in my opinion, from the emotional experience.In all, I would keep this on my shelf next to other selections, like ""The Lucky Ones"", ""Into The Wild"" and ""The Motorcycle Diaries""...

Powell,"[40, 41]","Ben Tyler discovers at the beginning of the film that he has a short time to live and despite the urgings of his fiancee and family to enter treatment immediately, he heads out on the road on a motorcycle. He takes photos of himself at man-made and natural landmarks, he meets people along the way who give him insights such as ""if you need to ask if you are really in love, you aren't,"" and ""I work the ranch without making enough money because there are other kinds of payments.""The other kinds of payments are hard to put into words. Things like being in contact with the wide open beauty of the land, or surfing, or enjoying the company of others.It is a complex film that captures the feeling of settling for second best, of believing what people tell you about yourself, and then discovering they were wrong.As a Canadian I identified strongly with Ben's journey. He has a romantic core, wants to instill some passion in his bored students -- but fails; he is unassuming and undemanding and states that if he could read the paper and drink coffee with his fiancee at their favorite coffee shop for the rest of his life, that would be enough; and Ben's journey is realistic -- the most danger he encounters is getting drowsy and skidding out of control on a squashed skunk. He wakes in the ditch with nothing broken and tries to dance and celebrate, but that is not his style. He is uncomfortable with too much outward exuberance. The real story is going on inside.Ben is perhaps not a typical Canadian, but he is ""my"" kind of Canadian, and so I was cheering for him - quietly, in my head, while I sipped tea and though of having a Tim Horton's donut. You see there is a kind of rebellious streak in Ben that I like, he is finding his identity after all, but his rebellion leads towards insight, not violence or crime or block busting. He takes the world as it is, noticing, accepting. Even if the giant chair or moose or giant ""whatever"" is less than wonderful -- he smiles at them.There is a self deprecating humour about all this, a kind of ""lets not get too excited -- or too disappointed"" attitude that sounds boring when you say it, but works so well in the film -- and in life really.

This was one of the more realistic cancer films I have seen in a bit, and (I feel) not worthy of the hate club that campaigns against it.Simply put, it is a film about a man who travels across his country after being diagnosed with a terminal illness. Like other good travel films, we see a sampling of the beautiful country that Canada has to offer, we encounter every-day personalities of people along the way and we learn a few lessons about ourselves and what life might be about. The difference here is that we get a insightful narration by Campbell Scott (most recognized of late with his role in Phoebe in Wonderland), which in itself provided some nice laugh-out-loud moments.I laughed at unexpected moments, saw some incredible Canadian scenery, and did not feel anything was contrived or cardboard (as most complainants have stipulated). The special features give this four-star film a five. The low-def ""Making-of"" contained just the right amount of logistical material on production, the commentary and interviews provide plenty of information for the followers and the remaining HD gallery, after party and trailer add just the right amount of extras to show the fun side of this film.The Blu quality is slightly better than the DVD, but there is still plenty of grain and and (very minute) random artifact. The grandiose panoramas could have been a bit clearer, the DTS was never fully utilized, even with the plethora of songs, but the presentation was still adequate. Not a reference Blu, but the film and special features make this a higher rating.",5,"Great film, decent Blu",1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,1670,"['am', 'not', 'Canadian', 'store', 'Canada', 'still', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'Canadian', 'travel', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'realistic', 'cancer', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'bit', 'feel', 'not', 'worthy', 'hate', 'club', 'it.Simply', 'put', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'country', 'being', 'diagnosed', 'terminal', 'illness', 'other', 'good', 'travel', 'films', 'see', 'sampling', 'beautiful', 'country', 'Canada', 'offer', 'encounter', 'every-day', 'personalities', 'people', 'way', 'learn', 'few', 'lessons', 'ourselves', 'what', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'about', 'difference', 'here', 'get', 'insightful', 'narration', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'most', 'recognized', 'late', 'role', 'Phoebe', 'Wonderland', 'provided', 'nice', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments.I', 'laughed', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'saw', 'incredible', 'Canadian', 'scenery', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'anything', 'was', 'contrived', 'cardboard', 'most', 'complainants', 'have', 'stipulated', 'special', 'features', 'give', 'four-star', 'film', 'five', 'low-def', 'Making-of', 'contained', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'logistical', 'material', 'production', 'commentary', 'interviews', 'provide', 'plenty', 'information', 'followers', 'remaining', 'HD', 'gallery', 'party', 'trailer', 'add', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'extras', 'show', 'fun', 'side', 'film.The', 'Blu', 'quality', 'slightly', 'better', 'DVD', 'still', 'plenty', 'grain', 'very', 'minute', 'random', 'artifact', 'grandiose', 'panoramas', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'clearer', 'DTS', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'utilized', 'even', 'plethora', 'songs', 'presentation', 'was', 'still', 'adequate', 'Not', 'reference', 'Blu', 'film', 'special', 'features', 'make', 'higher', 'rating']",One Week

While it begins with a familiar premise -- its protagonist discovers he has cancer & very little chance of survival, so he hits the road on a motorcycle to sort it all out -- the film has a deadpan, self-deflating sense of humor that lends it a different, fresher tone. The narration by Campbell Scott is a wonderful counterpoint to what we see onscreen, adding dimension to this journey of self-discovery.Joshua Jackson is very good as the seemingly doomed Ben Tyler, avoiding bathos while offering moments of genuine emotion. Also enjoyable are the moments which tell us how his momentary presence in other people's lives along the road change them forever, reminding us that we all have the potential to affect our world, often without ever realizing what we've done for others. While we've seem some of this in other films, it still works well.Jackson's true co-star is Canada itself. I've never been there, and of course I missed a lot of cultural references ... but the film makes me want to visit such beautiful country someday. It may not be a great film, but I found much to admire & even love while watching it.
