119798,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,0790749475,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Betty Comden & Adolph Green's THE BARKLEYS OF BROADWAY was the last Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, and what a great finale it is.Filmed in Technicolor on lavish sets, with gorgeous costumes and music provided by Harry Warren and Ira Gershwin, a familiar story of a couple breaking up and later reconciling has an added post-WWII twist of the woman choosing  her own career over being the lesser of two performing Barkleys.Song and dance man Josh Barkley's frequent reminders that his coaching was the key to wife Dinah's success is such a source of irritation to her, that when offered the lead in a legitimate drama Dinah chooses to leave musical comedy and her husband behind. Josh is jealous of playwright/director Jacques Barredout's doting on his wife, and even though they've officially separated, he lurks backstage during rehearsals of ""Young Sarah Bernhardt.""Dinah struggles in a serious role. Jacques loses patience and barks at her in front of other cast members. Sympathetic Josh secretly places a number of phone calls to Dinah and, by pretending to be Jacques, gives acting advice that helps her enormously. But it looks like the payoff is Josh will lose Dinah to his rival.Every musical piece in this film is a highlight. Co-star Oscar Levant amazes with his pianistic skill on two numbers, Khachaturian's ""Sabre Dance"" and the 1st movement of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto #2. Fred does a spot-on Harry Lauder impression on ""My One and Only Highland Fling."" Blue screen is used in the ""Shoes with Wings On"" number, where seven pairs of shoes (one is pink high heels) magically dance with Fred.A charity fund raiser is a perfect opportunity for Ginger and him to reprise the Gershwin brothers' ""They Can't Take That Away from Me,"" a song first heard inSHALL WE DANCE(1937). This time however, the two also dance to it. Astaire is clearly older than in his RKO days and Rogers is a bit thicker in the waist, yet they haven't lost the magic that makes a Fred & Ginger picture such a treat. Don't miss this final pairing of the greatest cinematic dance team of all time.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.8) The Barkleys of Broadway (1949) - Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers/Oscar Levant/Billie Burke/Gail Robbins/Jacques Franois/George Zucco (uncredited: Hans Conried)",4,"""A musical is a series of catastrophes ending with a floor show."" -- Oscar Levant",1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,2323,"['Betty', 'Comden', 'Adolph', 'Green', 'THE', 'BARKLEYS', 'OF', 'BROADWAY', 'was', 'last', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'movie', 'what', 'great', 'finale', 'is.Filmed', 'Technicolor', 'lavish', 'sets', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'music', 'provided', 'Harry', 'Warren', 'Ira', 'Gershwin', 'familiar', 'story', 'couple', 'breaking', 'up', 'later', 'reconciling', 'added', 'post-WWII', 'twist', 'woman', 'choosing', 'own', 'career', 'being', 'lesser', 'two', 'performing', 'Barkleys.Song', 'dance', 'man', 'Josh', 'Barkley', 'frequent', 'reminders', 'coaching', 'was', 'key', 'wife', 'Dinah', 'success', 'such', 'source', 'irritation', 'when', 'offered', 'lead', 'legitimate', 'drama', 'Dinah', 'leave', 'musical', 'comedy', 'husband', 'Josh', 'jealous', 'playwright/director', 'Jacques', 'Barredout', 'doting', 'wife', 'even', ""'ve"", 'officially', 'separated', 'backstage', 'rehearsals', 'Young', 'Sarah', 'Bernhardt', 'Dinah', 'serious', 'role', 'Jacques', 'patience', 'barks', 'front', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'Sympathetic', 'Josh', 'secretly', 'number', 'phone', 'calls', 'Dinah', 'pretending', 'be', 'Jacques', 'acting', 'advice', 'enormously', 'payoff', 'Josh', 'will', 'lose', 'Dinah', 'rival.Every', 'musical', 'piece', 'film', 'highlight', 'Co-star', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'pianistic', 'skill', 'two', 'numbers', 'Khachaturian', 'Sabre', 'Dance', '1st', 'movement', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Piano', 'Concerto', '2', 'Fred', 'spot-on', 'Harry', 'Lauder', 'impression', 'One', 'Only', 'Highland', 'Fling', 'Blue', 'screen', 'used', 'Shoes', 'Wings', 'number', 'where', 'seven', 'pairs', 'shoes', 'one', 'pink', 'high', 'heels', 'magically', 'dance', 'Fred.A', 'charity', 'fund', 'raiser', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'Ginger', 'reprise', 'Gershwin', 'brothers', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'Away', 'Me', 'song', 'first', 'heard', 'inSHALL', 'WE', 'DANCE', '1937', 'time', 'however', 'two', 'also', 'dance', 'Astaire', 'clearly', 'older', 'RKO', 'days', 'Rogers', 'bit', 'thicker', 'waist', 'yet', 'have', ""n't"", 'lost', 'magic', 'Fred', 'Ginger', 'picture', 'treat', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'final', 'pairing', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'dance', 'team', 'time.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.8', 'Barkleys', 'Broadway', '1949', 'Fred', 'Astaire/Ginger', 'Rogers/Oscar', 'Levant/Billie', 'Burke/Gail', 'Robbins/Jacques', 'Franois/George', 'Zucco', 'uncredited', 'Hans', 'Conried']",N/A

After the phenomenal success of ""Easter Parade"", the powers that be thought for certain (rightly so) that a follow-up pairing would be just as wonderful for the MGM coffers.  For whatever reason(s),Garland could not essay the role, so the powers that be felt that a reunion with Ginger Rogers would be right up Fred Astaire's alley.So they hauled out and dried off Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, under contract, had little say in the matter.  He went along with it; a company man.This film allows us the thrill and appreciation of enjoying the once-in-a-lifetime pairing of Garland and Astaire all the more.  This ""reunion"" between Fred and Ginger falls flat.  Very flat.  In their RKO musicals they were elegance personified but here they are MGM'd and Technicolored to the max and it's garish.  Not worthy of them.  Certainly, by this time (1948/9) Rogers needed something - anything - to further her career and a ""reunion"" with Fred seemed like a sure bet.I think the film is dreadful and I'm glad Garland didn't do it.

I never thought of this as an inferior film just because the formula separates itself from the RKO depression-era 30's (the film was made in 1949), though I seem to be hearing this a lot from critics. In fact, when I first saw the dance of 'They Can't Take That Away from Me,'  I actually thought it was a performance from a TV special, not a movie. The performance is an exhibit, not a love scene. There's something almost- I don't know- *cold* about the way they move on that bare, heavily draped, stage. It's also the first and only adagio they perform in color- which, in itself has a sense of an era ending. Nevertheless, they have the same emotional connection to each other, and at the ages of 38 and 50 respectively, they still carry off the grace and elegance. When they saunter off the stage, an excited audience breaks into applause- like they've been watching an act from THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW. It's extrordinary that ten years after Rogers remade herself doing straight award-winning drama and Astaire remade himself as a solo performer and a man who could dance with just about anyone, they could settle back into one more film and not have one strain of foot or hair out of place.

That said, there are enough musical and dance routines to lighten the air.

The merits are excellent colour and the stars themselves, mature and well cast and recreating their magic both in dance and in their obvious warmth and rapport. The drawbacks depend on whether you like MGM musicals or not. For me, the film has that overproduced and pretentious quality which was typical MGM. Oscar Levant is his usual tiresome self and there is one very high camp bit when Rogers recites the ""Le Marseillaise"" in a bid to demonstrate within the plot that she is a great dramatic actress. It is hard not to laugh.The print of the film is excellent and there is good choice of variable extras. The short film ""Annie was a Wonder"" is a sentimental and corny tale of a Swedish girl becoming an American citizen and hard to watch. The cartoon is another MGM dud with Droopy, the dog. The theatrical trailer for the film is included but best of all there is the last part of a series of documentaries about Astaire and Roger's legacy.

The plot is insubstantial - a husband and wife dance team squabbling over whether or not they should stay together or go their separate ways. The screenplay was by Betty Comden and Adolph Green.The supporting cast is headed by composer, pianist, and actor Oscar Levant who is his usual laconic, slightly cynical but always witty self; in the movie Levant gives sparkling performances of Khachaturian's Sabre Dance and a much edited first movement from Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concerto. We can see why George Gershwin chose Levant to champion his Piano Concerto after his death.The original film music is by Harry Warren with lyrics by Ira Gershwin or Arthur Freed.

Fred made several musicals, then retired briefly. ""Easter Parade"", with Judy Garland, was Fred's comeback.

Still, it has an interesting history.  Ten years earlier, they made their last picture.  Ginger was a last minute replacement for an injured Judy Garland.  The story as it were, revolves around John and Dinah Barkley, a successful song and dance team that perform on stage.  Dinah catches the eye of a French director who wants to cast her in the lead in a drama about a young silent movie star, Sarah Bernhardt.  Her hubby had been taking her for granted over the years and she wants something new.  Could this story ring true of Rogers and Astaire's relationship?  In any case, they break-up and she does the play, unaware that John has been giving her direction over the phone pretending to be her French director.  He of course, has also fallen for her.  As you might expect, the story is just pretense for some fine dancing.  Although I must admit, both Astaire and Rogers have begun to show a little ""tooth"" by this stage of their career.

But their constant bickering leads to a breakup, right in front of the cameras of  look magazine! Dinah goes to star in a play about the young Sarah Bernhart  and Josh continues his show with an understudy named Shirley- I mean,  &quot;It's Shirlene dear!&quot; Eventually, they realize how they can't  live without each other.This movie starts with a song called Swing Trot,  but it's hard to be seen behind the opening credits. Soon after, Dinah and  Josh have their first fight...on stage! They argue about which one deserves  the credit for the shows success in there curtain speeches. In the car to a  party at Mrs. Belding's house (played by Billie Burke-Glinda the Witch of  the North from the Wizard of Oz), the Barkleys have another fight,  forgiven, of course, soon after. Then, when Ginger leaves Fred out on the  terrace while she talks to a French playwright, Fred becomes mad at her,  but at the house, apologizes in song!Then, it's a few days later, and  Ginger finds out she's getting an understudy-just incase the Barkleys get  into a fight and Dinah decides not to go on one night. She doesn't seem to  mind at first, but casually tosses a chair across the room when the  understudy is gone!Later that day, Josh and Dinah go to an art museum,  where they are to see the unveiling of a new portrait of them. It shows  Dinah as a pancake, and Josh, as the plate that molds her. This really  annoys her!Then its time for my favorite song in the movie, My One and  Only Highland Fling. It's a tale of courting in the highlands of Scotland,  and both Ginger and Fred have a ball with their Scottish accents, and  Ginger has great facial expressions.After my One and Only Highland  Fling, Dinah and John go out to Mrs. Belding's house in the country with  their composer, Ezra (played by Oscar Levant).There, Dinah becomes  interested in the script the Monsieur Jacques Bardeux has completed on  Sarah Bernhart. Jacques is convinced Dinah is perfect for the part, but  Dinah refuses because of her success with Josh in her musical comedy show.  However, he does convince her to take home the script and read it. Josh  catches her reading it, and moments later, LOOK magazine comes in their  apartment for a photo shoot! That is when they split.Dinah goes to star  in &quot;The Young Sarah&quot; and Josh continues his musical comedy with  Shirlene, the understudy.Eventually, a fantastic dance number comes on.  It is called &quot;Shoes With Wings On&quot; and is danced by Fred Astaire.  Fred own a shoe shop, and his shoes come alive magically. Shoes With Wings  On is kind of The Sorcerers Apprentice from Walt Disney's Fantasia.Josh  snuck in on one of Dinah's rehearsals and hid in the back. He was shocked  with Jacques Bardeux's horrible direction, so later that night, he calls  Dinah, and has a dead-on impersonation of Jacques. He tells Dinah exactly  how to act and the next day at rehearsal, Jacques thinks she is wonderful.  He calls again the next night after watching rehearsal, and calls her  again, coaching her.Ezra arranges for Dinah and Josh to appear at a  hospital benefit without the other one knowing the other one will be there  too.  After he performs a wonderful &quot;touching&quot; performance of  Tchicolvsky's 1st Piano Concerto, he announces that Dinah and Josh will  perform a dance together! They are shocked, but eventually, Dinah and Josh  agree. They perform a great number called You Can't Take That Away From Me,  in which Fred sings. After their performance, Josh asks Dinah to talk with  him about rejoining, but she declines. One might think she is mean, but  when Josh leaves, Dinah begins to cry.The next thing you know, it is  Dinah's opening night in &quot;The Young Sarah&quot; and she is a  smash.Afterwards, Josh calls Dinah again and tries to sound like Jacques  and asks Dinah if she still loves her husband, or if she loves him. Then  Jacques walks in! She answers to whom she now realizes is Josh that she  loves Jacques just to torture him a little bit.Finally, she has realized  she must go back to Josh, so she goes to her old apartment where he still  lives, and puts on the record for the song You'd Be Hard to Replace, and  she lies down on a couch on the terrace. Just as the song is about to end,  the record starts repeating, and as she goes to fix it Josh walks in.As  she is about to leave, she quotes him from one of his phone calls. She also  explains to him that she really loves him and wants to go back to musical  comedy.This leads to Fred singing Manhattan Downbeat, the last  on-screen dance that the great immortals ever did together, which makes it  more enjoyable. Fred and Ginger dance in the living room, and then it fades  to the stage. Ginger is wearing a gorgeous colorful gown, and Fred is in a  black suit and top hat. As the song ends, Fred and Ginger get lost in the  chorus, but you can still pick out Ginger's gown! Then the camera zooms in  and freezes on Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire.This movie marked the end  of an era, the end of a great partnership, and is one of the best of the  ten Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire musicals... not to mention the only one  in Technicolor.",5,"Charming, Heartwarming...Together at long last!",960163200,"06 5, 2000",2000,5315,"['1949', 'Ginger', 'Rogers/Fred', 'Astaire',

It's nice to see A&R; in color, for once.The dances are really outstanding.  After a decade's break from musicals, Rogers jumps right back in without missing a beat.  And Astaire's dancing here is more athletic and energetic than in the earlier EASTER PARADE.The female lead was originally intended for Judy Garland, who would have done it well (she did everything well), but it seems even better suited to Rogers. The role fits her like a glove.On the downside, there's the heaviness of the MGM house style, that makes one long for the RKO light touch, and Oscar Levant -- who is more annoying than amusing and bangs on various pianos with a vengeance (what did those keys ever do to him?)  Levant has a formidible technique but he always seems to be punishing the piano for some grievous offence.  Lighten up, Oscar!I think people say this film improves with subsequent viewings because the first time you're bothered by the virtues of the old RKO films it doesn't possess ... once you get over that, you can appreciate it for its own considerable strengths.

119822,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,0790749475,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 2]","""The Barkleys of Broadway,"" a musical comedy/romance, (postwar, 1949) was, unexpectedly, the tenth and last film Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made together.  It finds Astaire 50 years old, and Rogers, 38, and was made, after a ten-year hiatus, during which they each did their own things, and Rogers won an Oscar for her serious work in ""Kitty Foyle."" Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios made it, rather than the pair's original studio, Radio Pictures(later RKO).  Famed MGM producer Arthur Freed, working in his prestigious music unit, gave it a no-expense spared gloss; it's the dancing couple's first and only picture together in color, full, saturated Technicolor, no less.The somewhat slow, stagebound script was by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and it is witty: at one point, Astaire says, ""I've been sneezing and coughing like a Model T."" As is widely known, Astaire, having stepped successfully into the dancing shoes that were meant for Gene Kelly in ""Easter Parade,"" and worked happily with Judy Garland, was expected to reteam with Garland here.  But Garland had been fired, she was ill, although she was apparently well enough to show up on the set, without invitation, and  harass Rogers, who had been invited to take her part. Most sources say that Comden and Green therefore had to rewrite the part for Rogers.  Most sources also point out that the scriptwriters somewhat followed real life, in that Astaire wanted to be the best song and dance man ever, whereas Rogers yearned for the respect given a serious actress, see ""Kitty Foyle.""  However, let's remember that Garland also yearned for the respect given a serious actress, and eventually made ""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" and ""A Star Is Born.""  So whose life were the scriptwriters really thinking about, from the beginning, anyway?At any rate, this movie differs from the stars' previous work in that they start out already married, (they are quite middle-aged by now) and bickering, rather than courting, and they are portrayed as being already at the height of their careers, enjoying a Broadway hit. They are Josh and Dinah Barkley in this one, and Rogers is tired of being made to feel that Astaire has been her Svengali; she wants a hit of her own, preferably a serious one.  The script also differs from their other work in that it provides them with no individual foils.  Instead we have the talented piano player and acerbic wit Oscar Levant as their mutual best friend, and Billie Burke in her usual scattered society hostess role.  Charles Waters directed; Cedric Gibbons art directed, giving the film its lively look.Nobody knows quite what to make of Rogers' way over the top, out of the blue, reading of ""La Marseillaise."" My only theory is that perhaps it was meant as a homage to the then fairly recent wartime ""Casablanca.""  If you can stop crying long enough during that film's ""Marseillaise"" scene, you'll notice that it, too, is a bit overwrought.  However....The film's original music was composed by the well-known Harry Warren, with lyrics by George Gershwin,who had died, shockingly young, and most agree the music's nice, but not up to the dancers' earlier great material.  However, the pair get a spirited, entertaining, rhythmic workout to ""Bouncing The Blues."" Their Scottish ""Highland Fling"" number is enjoyable.  ""Manhattan Downbeat"" just doesn't work.  Astaire's favorite, famed choreographer, Hermes Pan, comes back to work on the big, well-known ""Shoes With Wings."" But the evocative, emotional highpoint of the film has to be the reprise of ""They Can't Take That Away From Me,"" from ""Shall We Dance,"" on which both Ira and George Gershwin worked.  It reminds us of every reason we loved the earlier pictures.",4,Why We Loved Them,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,3705,"['Barkleys', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'comedy/romance', 'postwar', '1949', 'was', 'unexpectedly', 'tenth', 'last', 'film', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'made', 'together', 'Astaire', '50', 'years', 'old', 'Rogers', '38', 'was', 'made', 'ten-year', 'hiatus', 'did', 'own', 'things', 'Rogers', 'won', 'Oscar', 'serious', 'work', 'Kitty', 'Foyle', 'Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer', 'Studios', 'made', 'rather', 'pair', 'original', 'studio', 'Radio', 'Pictures', 'later', 'RKO', 'Famed', 'MGM', 'producer', 'Arthur', 'Freed', 'working', 'prestigious', 'music', 'unit', 'gave', 'no-expense', 'spared', 'gloss', 'dancing', 'couple', 'first', 'only', 'picture', 'together', 'color', 'full', 'saturated', 'Technicolor', 'less.The', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'stagebound', 'script', 'was', 'Betty', 'Comden', 'Adolph', 'Green', 'witty', 'one', 'point', 'Astaire', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sneezing', 'coughing', 'Model', 'T.', 'widely', 'known', 'Astaire', 'having', 'stepped', 'successfully', 'dancing', 'shoes', 'were', 'meant', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'Easter', 'Parade', 'worked', 'happily', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'was', 'expected', 'reteam', 'Garland', 'here', 'Garland', 'had', 'been', 'fired', 'was', 'ill', 'was', 'apparently', 'well', 'enough', 'show', 'up', 'set', 'invitation', 'harass', 'Rogers', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'invited', 'take', 'part', 'Most', 'sources', 'say', 'Comden', 'Green', 'therefore', 'had', 'rewrite', 'part', 'Rogers', 'Most', 'sources', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'scriptwriters', 'somewhat', 'followed', 'real', 'life', 'Astaire', 'wanted', 'be', 'best', 'song', 'dance', 'man', 'ever', 'whereas', 'Rogers', 'yearned', 'respect', 'given', 'serious', 'actress', 'see', 'Kitty', 'Foyle', 'However', 'let', 'remember', 'Garland', 'also', 'yearned', 'respect', 'given', 'serious', 'actress', 'eventually', 'made', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'A', 'Star', 'Is', 'Born', 'life', 'were', 'scriptwriters', 'really', 'thinking', 'beginning', 'anyway', 'rate', 'movie', 'differs', 'stars', 'previous', 'work', 'start', 'out', 'already', 'married', 'are', 'quite', 'middle-aged', 'now', 'bickering', 'rather', 'courting', 'are', 'portrayed', 'being', 'already', 'height', 'careers', 'enjoying', 'Broadway', 'hit', 'are', 'Josh', 'Dinah', 'Barkley', 'one', 'Rogers', 'tired', 'being', 'made', 'feel', 'Astaire', 'been', 'Svengali', 'hit', 'own', 'preferably', 'serious', 'one', 'script', 'also', 'differs', 'other', 'work', 'individual', 'foils', 'Instead', 'have', 'talented', 'piano', 'player', 'acerbic', 'wit', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'mutual', 'best', 'friend', 'Billie', 'Burke', 'usual', 'scattered', 'society', 'hostess', 'role', 'Charles', 'Waters', 'directed', 'Cedric', 'Gibbons', 'art', 'directed', 'giving', 'film', 'lively', 'look.Nobody', 'quite', 'what', 'make', 'Rogers', 'way', 'top', 'blue', 'reading', 'La', 'Marseillaise', 'only', 'theory', 'perhaps', 'was', 'meant', 'homage', 'then', 'fairly', 'recent', 'wartime', 'Casablanca', 'can', 'stop', 'crying', 'long', 'enough', 'film', 'Marseillaise', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'too', 'bit', 'overwrought', 'However', '.The', 'film', 'original', 'music', 'was', 'composed', 'well-known', 'Harry', 'Warren', 'lyrics', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'who', 'had', 'died', 'shockingly', 'young', 'most', 'agree', 'music', 'nice', 'not', 'dancers', 'earlier', 'great', 'material', 'However', 'pair', 'get', 'spirited', 'entertaining', 'rhythmic', 'workout', 'Bouncing', 'Blues', 'Scottish', 'Highland', 'Fling', 'number', 'enjoyable', 'Manhattan', 'Downbeat', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'Astaire', 'favorite', 'famed', 'choreographer', 'Hermes', 'Pan', 'back', 'work', 'big', 'well-known', 'Shoes', 'Wings', 'evocative', 'emotional', 'highpoint', 'film', 'be', 'reprise', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'Away', 'Me', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'Ira', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'worked', 'reason', 'loved', 'earlier', 'pictures']",N/A

Rogers is tired of being made to feel that Astaire has been her Svengali and craves a serious move. (Kitty Foyle, somebody?) The French climax was a brilliant touch.Astaire is awesome. The ""Shoes With Wings"" routine, I feel was only the third best dance scene in the movie. ""Bouncing The Blues,"" an entertaining workout, was incredible! Staccato taps, to stripper-like finish with Rogers concealing their affection with the curtain at dances end, was pure joy. Though not as limber as she was in her youth, Ginger looks athletically muscled, and makes up for the changes over time. Her partner leads with a chemistry only those two know.But the emotional apex of the film has to be the rhapsodic reprise of ""They Can't Take That Away From Me,"" from ""Shall We Dance,"" on which both Ira and George Gershwin worked. With Breathless artistry and excellent precision, I get chills watching this dance. Watch Ginger and Fred near the end of this closely: Magically mesmerizing, they made love in dance, and you can feel the flames of their passion.That timeless highlight was the pinnacle of their whole union.
