He plays Wong Fei-hong, the son of a chinese herbalist who has a propensity for the bottle. Chan pulls out the Drunken Boxing with the sort of physically comedic prowess that's earned him the respect of critics worldwide and is usually compared to classic actors like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Dubbed in English, the dialogue comes off pretty well and the jokes are solid throughout (especially from his mother, played with outrageous energy by Anita Mui). The final fight scene is breathtaking and the outtakes during the credits remind you that Chan does this all himself.

406963,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,6304198574,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[1, 1]","One of Jackies earliest movies in a starring role, (released in tandem with Snake in Eagles Shadow) that many would say started him on the road to stardom. I'm told in their native country, these simple storylines were churned out almost weekly and all pretty much follow the same formula. Similar to Saturday morning cowboy movies from days gone by, for Western audiences. The fact that Jackie has appeared in over 90 pictures, probably supports that fact. Here Jackie becomes student to a wisened old beggar who happens to be an expert exponent of ""Drunken Boxing"" and dutifully teaches Mr Chan, after he is helped by him. Jackie's love of Buster Keaton action slapstick, combined with the almost superhuman acrobat skills he acquired with the Peking Opera from a young age, blend masterfully, and the movie has plenty of humour as well as action. The fight scenes and stunts, are superbly executed (as usual)and the arduos training regime Jackie must endure, is both comical and revealing. Like so many Kung Fu style pictures of the era, this film sufferes terribly from bad dubbing, and is actually better watched in it's original form with subtitles. At 10 mins short of 2 hours is not that lean, but bounces along from scene to scene without making you worry too much. 16 years before the more widely known Legend of Drunken Master in 1994, this is still a great comic/action martial arts flick, and although it may not be as polished as his more recent work, the raw energy and exuberence of a more youthful Mr Chan, make this a must for fans and collectors alike.

406971,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6304198574,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[30, 33]","There's any number of reason to like international film star Jackie Chan...his superior athletic ability, infectious sense of humor, personable charm, but I think the one element that endears him to me is his willingness to put himself in the position of serious physical harm in order to entertain the audience.  Sure there are attempts to minimize the risks to some degree (meticulous planning and repetitive practicing), and given Chan's incredible physical prowess he's less likely to suffer harm than say I would trying to do half the things he does, but despite these factors, there is still the notion that with many of his stunts, particularly in his later films, he's always about a hair away from killing himself.  Anyway, directed by Woo-ping Yuen, who would later choreograph action scenes for the Matix and Kill Bill films, Drunken Master (1978) aka Jui kuen stars Jackie Chan (listed in the credits as Jacky) and Siu Tien Yuen (the director's father).The film begins as an assassin named Thunderleg, Master of the Devil's Kick, searching out his most recent target in that of The Champion of the Four Door Fist (not all, but a lot of the characters have titles like this).  He finds him, a battle ensues, and one is left standing.  We then cut to a scene featuring students practicing martial arts in a school.  It's here we meet one of the pupils named Wong Fei-Hung (Chan), whose father actually runs the school.  Wong appears fairly adept (after showing up one of the teachers), but lacks the discipline and humility to achieve beyond his current skills, which becomes obvious to his father after a series of incidents involving a local bully, among others.  This leads Wong's father to request another to assume training of Wong in that of an older man who's rumored to be incredibly difficult and completely sadistic.  Wong decides to run away, but ends up meeting his new teacher (Siu Tien Yuen), a master of the 8 Drunken Gods fighting styles, after an altercation at a restaurant.  Wong begins his training with his new master, but soon runs off, as it's too difficult.  This sets up a chance meeting between Thunderleg and Wong were Wong gets the thrashing of a lifetime and ends up returning to the Drunken Master, realizing his own skills are pitiful.  This leads into a lengthy set of training sequences eventually leading to the Master teaching Wong the secret fighting tactics of the 8 Drunken Gods.  As Wong's training is completed, we find out a contract has been taken out on his father, one to be fulfilled by Thunderleg, so now Wong must put his training to the test in the fight of his life (or death).I think I should mention, as a number of reviewers have brought it up, something about the partial English dubbing within the film.  The copy I received a little while ago has a little sticker on the back of the DVD case stating something in the way of `English substituted in some areas where original dialog track lost'.  The effect is that when you're watching the film with the original Cantonese audio track, using English subtitles, there are scenes where the characters switch from Cantonese to really goofy sounding voices speaking English.  This happens about three or four times, and it is a little annoying as it tended to draw me out of the film.  I would have preferred that, if some of the original audio were lost, a re-recording in the same language as the original dialog...but whatever...now on to the film.  The movie is crammed with excellent wall-to-wall fight scenes.  There are momentary lapses devoted to working on the plot, but these quickly pass resulting in more fight sequences.  I think my favorite sequence, besides the lengthy one at the end, featured Siu Tien Yuen in the restaurant, smacking assailants with a dishrag.  Not only was it really funny, but almost hypnotic as he twirled that towel around before rat tailing someone in the face (in case you're not familiar, `rat tailing' means taking a wet towel, twisting it up, and snapping it at poor individual).  Can anyone tell me what was up with that teacher Chan's character beats up on near the beginning?  The guy had this mole on his face, one that had this set of really long hairs emanating from it, and the guy could often be seen playing with the hair, twirling it with his fingers...it was pretty disgusting.  And what was the deal with that waiter from the restaurant?  Was that the biggest set of buckteeth you've ever seen?  I suppose these were some of what made up the comedic element of this film, but they weren't all that funny.  What was funny was the scene where Chan's character is trying to learn the drunken fighting style of the lone woman god, doing so in a mocking fashion as he thought it was too effeminate.  Another concept I found really funny was the whole notion of fighting styles based of being intoxicated, and the fact Wong's teacher was drunk throughout most of the film.  The choreography in the fighting scenes is really spectacular as Chan not only displays that psuedo comic fighting style he's famous for, but also a lot of serious chop socky.  Don't expect to see Chan doing any large scale, over the top stunts like leaping off building, as seen in his later films, but do expect lots of close up, smacky smacky action (he also takes the beating like no one I've ever seen).The picture on this DVD is very good (some cropping), presented in 2.35:1 widescreen, enhanced for 16 X 9 TVs.  The monaural audio is decent, but certainly nothing to brag about.  Special features include a commentary track including Hong Kong film expert Ric Meyers and Jeff Yang, a co-author of Chan's autobiography.  Also included are trailers for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and Time and Tide (2000).Cookieman108",4,"""I'm drunk with inner strength!""",1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,5768,"['number',

At the time movies were just not done like this especially in the Kung-Fu area until Chan stepped the game up, the original Kung Fu Hustle you could say. I have loved this film since the first time I was privileged to see it and truly believe it is one of the all time greats in film history, not just in its own genre. I can honestly say that I have never met any one who did not like this movie, any one who had seen it that is.Wong Fei-Hung [Chan] is a very gifted and talented young man but his inability to take his craft seriously won't let him achieve his full potential. He acts out and does not listen to any one including his teacher at his father's school; in fact he likes to show the teacher up. He is also fond of showing up any and every one that he pleases and can but an unfortunate event involving a woman and her daughter land him in hot water with his father. After countless times of trying to make him learn a little something his father decides to bring in outside help in the form of Su Hua Chi [Siu Tien Yuen], a master of the 8 Drunken Gods fighting styles. Of course Wong is not keen on the idea and runs off in order to escape his responsibilities. That all changes after a brawl at a restaurant were the master saves him, and then begins to train him. The training is not going all that well and Wong runs off again only to run into a hit man named Thunderleg [Jang Lee Hwang] who destroys him and makes him realize how little he knows. Add in the fact that this man is out to kill his father Wong must now take his training seriously in order to not only save his father but find himself as well.This film has got to be one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen in my life as it is full of excellent fight sequences and full of great humor. This was the first of its kind mixing the martial arts with slapstick humor and this happened because Jackie wanted to have a separate identity from Bruce Lee. What a grand idea it was because the result was this master piece that also added a new twist on an old character. Wong was one of the most popular characters in the genre's history and was a very serious character, until Chan came with this. The fight sequences are also another up side to this wonder film has with most Jackie flicks the film shines when he is on screen doing his thing. The actual fighting is amazing and the comedy gags mixed in with his facial expressions only add to the good time.Directed by Woo-ping Yuen who was also a writer along side producer See-Yuen Ng and Hsiao Lung this is by far a classic and is well worth any price that is asked in my opinion. This DVD comes with a wonderful commentary that is full of info and is very interesting, and some trailers.

He was kind and intelligent. Drunken Master(1978) is a prequel with a young Jackie Chan playing a bratty, spoiled, mean Wong Fei Hung who has not grown up into a real man yet! It's insulting, yet a new, fresh concept. Stern, wisecracking kung fu teacher So Yua Yi/Sam Seed(Simon Yuen) has been hired to teach Wong Fei Hung. The film was made with a limited budget and it uses stock music from The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie(1968). Then again, Drunken Master has some of the best kung fu fights put on film. The camera work is good, too. The kung fu fighters are well filmed and we can see what is going on. The film uses the song 'On the General's Orders' when Wong Fei Hung does kung fu.

This veeery broad kung fu comedy has a goofy, relaxed atmosphere to it that makes it enjoyable to watch. Also, the fight scenes (admittedly what really matters in a movie like this) are expertly choreographed, and a genuine thrill to watch. The melodramatic (if almost non-existant) conflict between Chan and bad guy Hwang Jang Lee only adds to the fun. Plus, Simon Yuen as the old master was never better.The DVD from Columbia is in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, after many years of faded pan-and-scan videos. The picture is a tad scratchy, although it's without a doubt the best this movie has looked in a long time. Thankfully, in addition to the English dub, the original Cantonese language track is included (although sections that were apparently lost have been replaced by the English).

They didn't even do anything to enhance it, so it looks just like the cheesy 70's flick it is. The fight scenes are cool at times, but they are very long, as is the whole movie. It's not exactly the most exciting martial arts movie I have ever seen either.A very young Jackie Chan plays a karate student with lots of talent, but also a lot of laziness and a tendency to misbehave. His angry instructors sentence him to training with and old man who has earned a reputation for being cruel and injuring his students. Jackie Chan tries to escape, but to no avail. After much ineffectual hassling with this old man, Jackie agrees to let him teach him the art of Drunken Boxing. It is a culmination of styles taken from eight different gods, which can only be done when - you guessed it - drunk. Jackie, however, refuses to learn the style of the eighth god because she is a woman, which later turns out to be a bad move. (He does, however, make a good ladylike impression of her :) that was one of the funny parts) He gets in a lot of fights along the way and in the end winds up fighting for his father's honor.Overall, don't expect it to be absolutely action-packed or hilarious, the jokes are the kind you may smile at but don't laugh out loud.

I've seen a lot of old kung fu movies that swiped a lot of things from this one.  Simon Yuen's portrayal of the crabby old master has been re-used ad nauseam, often by him.  This is certainly a stepping-stone in the evolution of kung fu cinema, and for that alone it's worth a viewing.  Otherwise I would avoid it.

However, I used to watch this on vhs, so when this remastered dvd came out I got really excited to see it and add it to my collection but was dissapointed not long after it started.You see, on the vhs version, the english dubbed voices and dialog are different. I am so used to that version that it's actually quite difficult to enjoy this movie the same on dvd. The same thing happened from the original Iron Monkey vhs to the Quentin Tarantino presents version. It really throws me off. It may not sound like a big deal but what if someone suddenly re-released Star Wars with different voices and some changed dialog. No, this is not Star Wars but you get the idea. This one even has profanity that was completely absent in the older version. Most people probably won't notice it or realize it as this'll be the first version they've seen but I write this for me and for those who had the same reaction I did. I'm gonna try to hunt down an older dvd with original dubbing cause it's just so different. Other than that, the transfer is good and you'll see some of the best kung fu you'll see anywhere. Its a 5 star film for sure.The sign of truly quality kung fu is how long the camera stays on the action without switching angles. In these switches, the actors usually stop, then restart a new series of moves, only memorizing a few moves at a time. In almost all of Jackie Chan's older movies, you'll see the camera stay on for a long, stringed together series of movements and you'll only then really appreciate the talent it takes to put those in succession over a long length of time. It'll change the way you look at action and fighting sequences in movies. You'll see some cheap films where the actors throw 2 or 3 punches then stop, 2 or 3 more moves, then stop and repeat. But Jackie puches, kicks, jumps, rolls, ducks, and repeats and repeats in one camera shot!!! He's truly amazing and is the greatest movie martial artist I've ever seen. For you football fans out there, he's the Barry Sanders of kung fu. Nobody moves like Jackie. Many people are quick to point out Bruce Lee as the greatest martial artist ever and in the real world, maybe he was, but when it comes to kung fu movies, he's not even close to Jackie Chan.For other great Jackie Chan films, check out Snake and Crane:Arts of Shaolin, Dragon Fist, Snake in the Eagles Shadow, and Young Master.",3,"Right Video, Wrong Audio",1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,2477,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'times', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'best', 'one', 'best', 'kung', 'fu', 'films', 'ever', 'However', 'used', 'watch', 'vhs', 'so', 'when', 'remastered', 'dvd', 'came', 'out', 'got', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'add', 'collection', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'not', 'long', 'started.You', 'see', 'vhs', 'version', 'english', 'dubbed', 'voices', 'dialog', 'are', 'different', 'am', 'so', 'used', 'version', 'actually', 'quite', 'difficult', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'same', 'dvd', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'original', 'Iron', 'Monkey', 'vhs', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'version', 'really', 'off', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'big', 'deal', 'what', 'someone', 'suddenly', 're-released', 'Star', 'Wars', 'different', 'voices', 'changed', 'dialog', 'No', 'not', 'Star', 'Wars', 'get', 'idea', 'one', 'even', 'profanity', 'was', 'completely', 'absent', 'older', 'version', 'Most', 'people', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'realize', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'version', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'write', 'who', 'had', 'same', 'reaction', 'did', ""'m"", 'gon', 'try', 'hunt', 'down', 'older', 'dvd', 'original', 'dubbing', 'cause', 'just', 'so', 'different', 'Other', 'transfer', 'good', ""'ll"", 'see', 'best', 'kung', 'fu', ""'ll"", 'see', 'anywhere', '5', 'star', 'film', 'sure.The', 'sign', 'truly', 'quality', 'kung', 'fu', 'how', 'long', 'camera', 'action', 'switching', 'angles', 'switches', 'actors', 'usually', 'stop', 'then', 'restart', 'new', 'series', 'moves', 'only', 'memorizing', 'few', 'moves', 'time', 'almost', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'older', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'see', 'camera', 'stay', 'long', 'stringed', 'together', 'series', 'movements', ""'ll"", 'only', 'then', 'really', 'appreciate', 'talent', 'put', 'succession', 'long', 'length', 'time', ""'ll"", 'change', 'way', 'look', 'action', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'see', 'cheap', 'films', 'where', 'actors', 'throw', '2', '3', 'punches', 'then', 'stop', '2', '3', 'more', 'moves', 'then', 'stop', 'repeat', 'Jackie', 'puches', 'kicks', 'jumps', 'rolls', 'ducks', 'repeats', 'repeats', 'one', 'camera', 'shot', 'truly', 'amazing', 'greatest', 'movie', 'martial', 'artist', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'football', 'fans', 'there', 'Barry', 'Sanders', 'kung', 'fu', 'Nobody', 'moves', 'Jackie', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'greatest', 'martial', 'artist', 'ever', 'real', 'world', 'maybe', 'was', 'when', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'Jackie', 'Chan.For', 'other', 'great', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'films', 'check', 'out', 'Snake', 'Crane', 'Arts', 'Shaolin', 'Dragon', 'Fist', 'Snake', 'Eagles', 'Shadow', 'Young', 'Master']",N/A

407017,A2UDYL0ITJ3Y17,6304198574,the kung fu kid,"[10, 10]","DRUNKEN MASTER is one of Jackie Chan's all time greats (the film itself is a 5 star film, only this DVD gets a 3 star rating).  He plays a naughty little rascal named Huang Fei Hung (yes, the same character Kwan Tak Hing made famous in a series of nearly 100 films and later by Jet Li in the ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA series of films) who's sent by his father to the famous Sam the Seed (the old Drunken Master himself, Simon Yuen) to learn discipline.  Huang Fei Hung can't take the torturous training and runs away, but after getting beat up and humiliated by a wicked kicking Master (he burns the kid's pants, badmouths his father's kung fu, and makes him crawl between his legs like a dog) he quickly repents and begs Sam the Seed to take him back.  The film is a delightful mixture of kung fu, comedy, and drama with enough dazzling displays of martial arts and acrobatics to keep viewing fresh time after time.My gripe with this DVD is that the English language track is NOT the wonderfully fun one released previously on VHS featuring those loveably familiar English dubbed kung fu movie voices of the 1970s-80s.  Some people hate those English dub jobs and will always prefer the original Chinese language tracks (which fortunately ARE on the DVD with choice of subtitles), but there are those of us who also enjoy watching the old English dubbed versions for their sheer camp value and cartoon-like energy.  Those same voices (found on almost all exported kung fu films of that time period) have become like family members (the ones you want to have visit!).  The voice actors then may have switched roles from picture to picture, not ALWAYS voicing the same onscreen actors as you saw and heard them do before, and they may not have been of Royal Shakespeare Company standard, but they always brought with them a smile of recognition and often livened up otherwise dull proceedings.Some simply don't like English dubs.  &quot;The words don't match their mouths and it's always the same voices!&quot;  Well, guess what?  That's the case even in the original language.  The Chinese tracks are almost always dubbed in afterwards by actors other than the ones onscreen.  Sure they may come a little closer to matching the lips since the actors words are closer to the words dubbed in later, and some of the voice artists may be familiar with and try to sound similar to the real actor, but it's still nowhere near to perfect lip-synching.  Even when the audio is recorded live in synch-sound, the English subtitles still differ from the actual words spoken due to the complex nature of translation (and by golly, what do you do if you're eating, and don't catch all the words during the dialogue driven portions of the film while you're looking at your plate?).For myself, I will admit that there IS something about original language tracks and subtitles that DOES work better for the more serious pictures as they lend a kind of authenticity and intelligence to the viewing experience (after all we are forced to READ during them which IS a scolarly endeavor, isn't it?), but for the comedy laden kung fu flicks of the 70s and 80s it's nice sometimes to just sit back and relax to the goofy sounds of the old English dubs.  The voice-over actors of HK films of the 90s and today just don't cut the mustard.  Most sound like second rate actors trying to sound like first rate actors, the result being a bore.  The old dubbers may have been third rate actors, but at least they were having fun and the voices they chose matched the pictures.  There's nothing more enjoyable, or appropriatly matching in sound and sight, than the old voices used for the weasel characters of Dean Shek or the interpreter found in FISTS OF FURY (aka THE CHINESE CONNECTION).  Back then the villains sounded like creeps, the good guys sounded like heroes, the rascals sounded like wiseguys, and the big guys sounded like Bullwinkle!After all of that then, this DVD release of DRUNKEN MASTER does NOT feature the original English dub and its loveable voices of the 70s.  It has a newer, unimproved English track, and quite a bit of the dialogue is different as well.  The English dub here is simply NO FUN.  Maybe whoever redid the track wanted it to sound less cartoon-like and more natural, but you can't voice a comedy using serious voices that don't match the comedic energy of the performers onscreen!  The old crew had that energy (and even the times that they lacked it was fun, too, because when they lacked it back then, boy, they REALLY lacked it!).  The remastered DVDs of SNAKE AND CRANE ARTS OF SHAOLIN, FEARLESS HYENA, and DRAGON FIST all contain those wonderfully voiced original English dubs (as well as the original Cantonese or Mandarin track depending on the film).  Why was DRUNKEN MASTER, one of the GREATEST kung fu movies ever, not treated the same?  Were they trying to give it a new respect after the success of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON?  They should have realized that DRUNKEN MASTER already HAS respect here, and in part because of the wonderful sense of fun found in the original English dub.  I wish those old actors would get more credit for bringing such wonderfully guilty pleasure to so many fans.Oh, and for those wanting to know more about the film itself, it contains Simon Yuen's defining performance as the charismatic old Drunken Master, Yuen Wo Ping's masterful direction using action and comedy to propel the story along, one of Hwang Jang Lee's most villainous performances and some of the greatest kicking abilities ever displayed onscreen, and a young Jackie Chan's complete devotion to character, pushing his body and comedic talents to the limits.Watch it in Chinese with subtitles on this DVD and then listen to Ric Meyers' wonderful commentary, but for English dub lovers I HIGHLY recommend finding a copy containing the original English dubbed version and watching that version over this one.",3,"One of JC's Best Films, but I HATE this DVD's newer Eng dub!",1077408000,"02 22, 2004",2004,5931,"['DRUNKEN', 'MASTER', 'one', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'time', 'greats',

If you won't be so critical and just judge it with the old day standard, it is still a well-made movie. There is not much plot. The acting is just so-so, sometimes a little silly. But in 70's, most of the Kung Fu movies are of this style. The difference is that this movie is extremely well choreographed. The fighting is not violent and is blended with plenty of fun and creativity. The part that the beggar plays with Jackie Chan in the wood is one of my favourite scene of the movie. It is amazing that the beggar can play with Jackie's body in so many ways you can hardly fancy.It is one of Yuan Wooping's early works. The fighting has changed so much over the years (Drunken Master II (Jackie Chan's 1994 work) is a modern Kung Fu movie, watch that for to see the difference). But there is no wire work, no special effects. The actors actually did everything you see. If you can think of how much effort it takes to design and practise so many fighting scenes before they are ready to be shot, yet every scene is still so full of imagination, you will truly appreciate this movie as a classic.",5,"Classic old style Kung Fu movie, for its choreography",1005436800,"11 11, 2001",2001,1201,"['very', 'typical', 'old', 'style', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movie', 'made', '1978', 'made', 'purely', 'entertainment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'critical', 'just', 'judge', 'old', 'day', 'standard', 'still', 'well-made', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'acting', 'just', 'so-so', 'sometimes', 'little', 'silly', '70', 'most', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movies', 'are', 'style', 'difference', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fighting', 'not', 'violent', 'blended', 'plenty', 'fun', 'creativity', 'part', 'beggar', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'wood', 'one', 'favourite', 'scene', 'movie', 'amazing', 'beggar', 'can', 'play', 'Jackie', 'body', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'can', 'hardly', 'fancy.It', 'one', 'Yuan', 'Wooping', 'early', 'works', 'fighting', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'years', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'II', 'Jackie', 'Chan', '1994', 'work', 'modern', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movie', 'watch', 'see', 'difference', 'wire', 'work', 'special', 'effects', 'actors', 'actually', 'did', 'everything', 'see', 'can', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'effort', 'design', 'practise', 'so', 'many', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'ready', 'be', 'shot', 'yet', 'scene', 'still', 'so', 'full', 'imagination', 'will', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'classic']",N/A
