403397,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6304132654,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 1]","This is one of the best theme-oriented Sesame Street videos, a collection of songs sung by various monster Muppets, notably the super-blue, super-furry Herry Monster, who co-hosts the ""Fuzzy Awards,"" a Grammy-style award show that provides the glue for the video release.  Elmo is Herry's co-host, but other than some comedic skits during the interludes, Elmo is admirably in the background on this one... More Herry!  More Grover!  More Cookie Monster!

I have old school seasame street books back from 30 years ago from my older brother, so I am quite familar with the old monsters. My almost 1 year old son loves frazzle, everytime he sees a page with him in it he kicks his legs and gives me a huge smile. :-D I am saving this for his birthday in november but my friend has the dvd also so I did get to view it and it was very musical and fun, an attention grabbing for any young kid.

This video is a riot and my daughter begs for it almost daily.  Set-up like an awards show, the songs ""Fur"" and ""Fuzzy and Blue"" are fun and entertaining even for adults.  I like this video because it includes the character Frazzle, who was dropped because he was deemed ""too scary"" to kids.  My 2 year old LOVES Frazzle and begs for his song over and over.  How's that for scary?  This video is cute and the songs are fun.

I always preview the tapes before my 17 month old watches them, just to make sure they aren't too scary.  I watched this one twice, I loved it so much!  This tape is now played every day without fail, and we all love it.  Don't be put off by the style of the songs.

It is nice to see the monsters that don't get a lot of play, though.  Herry Monster is in about half of the songs.
