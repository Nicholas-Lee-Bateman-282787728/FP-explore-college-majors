But the way he humanely captures many animals and sets them free is so great. So many folks are more than willing to just kill things that have gotten into homes instead of being kind.,5,Love this series!,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,318,"['show', 'neat', 'learn', 'things', 'watching', 'Creepy', 'crawlies', 'are', 'totally', 'freak', 'out', 'stuff', 'Roach', 'infested', 'homes', 'Yikes', 'way', 'humanely', 'many', 'animals', 'sets', 'free', 'so', 'great', 'So', 'many', 'folks', 'are', 'more', 'willing', 'just', 'kill', 'things', 'have', 'gotten', 'homes', 'instead', 'being', 'kind']",N/A

1376902,A2VOQCCVPN5Y8W,B003Z88IDK,Ed Williams,"[11, 12]","When I saw my first episode of ""Billy the Exterminator,"" I was instantly hooked! Just how cool is it to watch someone tackle pests like giant yellow jacket nests, bobcats, and hoards of bats up in someone's attic? At first these type situations were the draw, then I starting noticing something as the episodes progressed. Billy is actually a very cool and sweet guy - he obviously cares about his family, he cares about his work, and a couple of times I've fought back a tear or two watching him help, as an example, a family of three kids who'd recently lost their mom. They had a huge roach infestation problem, one beyond my ability to aptly describe here. Billy not only treated the problem and corrected it, he did so gratis and even gave the kids autographs when they asked him for them. In the end, this is what makes Billy and what's destroyed Kate Gosselin - Billy is real. I predict that ""Billy the Exterminator"" will run for 4-7 years, and after its run Billy will still be at Vexcon happily running the family business. It appears that he knows who he is, his priorities are what they ought to be, and his compassion and humor show through in every single episode.And hey, before I forget - Big Bill is funny as hell, he has a very dry sense of humor. Ricky and Billy together deliver classic lines in some sequences (""This is the Vexcon totem pole of death!""), and Donnie is a classy, mature lady, she's even kinda hot!Billy rocks - check this season one and you'll understand why!",5,"Billy rocks, and so do Big Bill, Ricky, and Donnie!",1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,1495,"['When', 'saw', 'first', 'episode', 'Billy', 'Exterminator', 'was', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'Just', 'how', 'cool', 'watch', 'someone', 'tackle', 'pests', 'giant', 'yellow', 'jacket', 'nests', 'bobcats', 'hoards', 'bats', 'up', 'someone', 'attic', 'first', 'type', 'situations', 'were', 'draw', 'then', 'starting', 'noticing', 'something', 'episodes', 'progressed', 'Billy', 'actually', 'very', 'cool', 'sweet', 'guy', 'obviously', 'family', 'work', 'couple', 'times', ""'ve"", 'fought', 'back', 'tear', 'two', 'watching', 'help', 'example', 'family', 'three', 'kids', 'who', ""'d"", 'recently', 'lost', 'mom', 'had', 'huge', 'roach', 'infestation', 'problem', 'one', 'ability', 'aptly', 'describe', 'here', 'Billy', 'not', 'only', 'treated', 'problem', 'corrected', 'did', 'so', 'gratis', 'even', 'gave', 'kids', 'autographs', 'when', 'asked', 'end', 'what', 'Billy', 'what', 'destroyed', 'Kate', 'Gosselin', 'Billy', 'real', 'predict', 'Billy', 'Exterminator', 'will', 'run', '4-7', 'years', 'run', 'Billy', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'Vexcon', 'happily', 'running', 'family', 'business', 'who', 'priorities', 'are', 'what', 'ought', 'be', 'compassion', 'humor', 'show', 'single', 'episode.And', 'hey', 'forget', 'Big', 'Bill', 'funny', 'hell', 'very', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'Ricky', 'Billy', 'together', 'deliver', 'classic', 'lines', 'sequences', 'Vexcon', 'totem', 'pole', 'death', 'Donnie', 'classy', 'mature', 'lady', 'even', 'kinda', 'hot', 'Billy', 'check', 'season', 'one', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why']",N/A

1376907,A6FIAB28IS79,B003Z88IDK,Samuel Chell,"[2, 2]","I watch Billy with by 4-5 year-old grandchildren whenever they visit (I use an iPod screen to lessen the ""fear"" element--for them, not me).  Billy of course has the currently fashionable ""Satanic threads"" and S&M; paraphernalia but nevertheless comes off as a sensitive, animal- (and people-) caring human being, with a generous spirit toward the pests as well as the clients who seek his services.If at all possible, Billy doesn't exterminate his prey: whether gators, snakes, bobcats or bats, he seeks relocation unless there clearly is no alternative.  Thus he enables the adult to stress points about the value and purpose of all creatures, however we as humans distort their actual nature and value to the ecosystem.  (When teaching Blake, I find that older students require a bit of a shocker, a wake-up call, before they can begin to comprehend Blake's mysticism and the ironical meanings of ""Songs of Innocence and Experience.""  Sometimes nothing less than a statement such as ""In God's eyes, all creation is holy, a poisonous snake or HIV virus no less so than a gentle lamb"" can at least get their attention and lead to slower, more careful, considered reading.  Blake's targets are not limited to what we habitually deem as threats to human safety; his is the angriest voice in English literature, denouncing human reason at every opportunity, using the doomed young chimney sweeps employed by the church (!) as his prime example of a corrupt civilization.  He carefully constructs an unforgettable portrait of a violent and voracious Tiger but as an awe-inspiring image of the power of its Creator, not as a symbol of evil.""Swamp People"" embraces fictions of the past--we kill to eat--showing us gator after gator being outmanned and outgunned by these rugged individualist-family traditionalists who live off the land and know no other way of life (of course, like Dog who rides around in a shiny SUV, saying his family-circle thank-you prayer after each successful bounty, the gator-eaters also have some of the latest and best equipment for moving quickly across swamp water and getting their prey.  For the swamp people, catastrophes such as Katrina and the BP disaster apparently never occurred.  Nature seems rife with bountiful fruits forever ripe for the taking--from Gators to shrimp to hundreds of snakes bringing hundreds of dollars per snake.  Both Dog and Swamp People are too close to the present state of the American electorate to be positive examples: be a tough, good guy; keep government out of the picture; don't tax the rich; don't waste time reading and thinking about stuff; be God-fearing and patriotic; never give up on yourself and be assured of success in all you endeavor).""Billy"" would be a stronger ""reality"" show if the character of Billy's brother, Ricky, were more sharply delineated and better established.  He lacks Billy's chest-out, charismatic and reassuring swagger, and his gentle voice simply doesn't make him seem any more human or generous.  At present, he's a kind of pale shadow of the show's main exterminator-hero, gentler but not firmer or more stable, and dressing him up in clothes resembling Billy's merely emphasizes his ""wannabe"" persona.  (Wisely, the directors of ""Dog"" do not try to make Dog's daughter look like a gangsta-rapper wild girl, and she's more convincing as an independent character because of it.)  If the producers of ""Billy"" could make Ricky become the ""brains"" of the operation, getting him to read up and study each of the pests and then share his expertise, his character might become a convincing ""cerebral"" complement to Billy's more physical persona.  (It's a bit of a downer to see a snake and be told it's a snake, no mention of species.)  Notice the number of other shows that successfully combine intuitive, hunkish brawn with anti-heroic (not non-heroic) yet admirable nerds and geeks.  As it is, he's a Billy copy-cat, practically exterminated by the show's eponymous character.",4,Preferable to Dog or Swamp People (but what to do about Ricky?),1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,3973,"['watch', 'Billy', '4-5', 'year-old', 'grandchildren', 'whenever', 'visit', 'use', 'iPod', 'screen', 'lessen', 'fear', 'element', 'not', 'Billy', 'course', 'currently', 'fashionable', 'Satanic', 'threads', 'S', 'M', 'paraphernalia', 'nevertheless', 'off', 'sensitive', 'animal-', 'people-', 'caring', 'human', 'being', 'generous', 'spirit', 'pests', 'as', 'well', 'clients', 'who', 'seek', 'services.If', 'possible', 'Billy', ""n't"", 'exterminate', 'prey', 'gators', 'snakes', 'bobcats', 'bats', 'relocation', 'clearly', 'alternative', 'Thus', 'adult', 'stress', 'points', 'value', 'purpose', 'creatures', 'however', 'humans', 'distort', 'actual', 'nature', 'value', 'ecosystem', 'When', 'teaching', 'Blake', 'find', 'older', 'students', 'require', 'bit', 'shocker', 'wake-up', 'call', 'can', 'begin', 'comprehend', 'Blake', 'mysticism', 'ironical', 'meanings', 'Songs', 'Innocence', 'Experience', 'Sometimes', 'nothing', 'less', 'statement', 'such', 'God', 'eyes', 'creation', 'holy', 'poisonous', 'snake', 'HIV', 'virus', 'less', 'so', 'gentle', 'lamb', 'can', 'least', 'get', 'attention', 'lead', 'slower', 'more', 'careful', 'considered', 'reading', 'Blake', 'targets', 'are', 'not', 'limited', 'what', 'habitually', 'deem', 'threats', 'human', 'safety', 'angriest', 'voice', 'English', 'literature', 'denouncing', 'human', 'reason', 'opportunity', 'using', 'doomed', 'young', 'chimney', 'sweeps', 'employed', 'church', 'prime', 'example', 'corrupt', 'civilization', 'carefully', 'unforgettable', 'portrait', 'violent', 'voracious', 'Tiger', 'awe-inspiring', 'image', 'power', 'Creator', 'not', 'symbol', 'evil', 'Swamp', 'People', 'fictions', 'past', 'kill', 'eat', 'showing', 'gator', 'gator', 'being', 'outmanned', 'outgunned', 'rugged', 'individualist-family', 'traditionalists', 'who', 'live', 'land', 'know', 'other', 'way', 'life', 'course', 'Dog', 'who', 'rides', 'shiny', 'SUV', 'saying', 'family-circle', 'thank-you', 'prayer', 'successful', 'bounty', 'gator-eaters', 'also', 'have', 'latest', 'best', 'equipment', 'moving', 'quickly', 'swamp', 'water', 'getting', 'prey', 'swamp', 'people', 'catastrophes', 'such', 'Katrina', 'BP', 'disaster', 'apparently', 'never', 'occurred', 'Nature', 'rife', 'bountiful', 'fruits', 'forever', 'ripe', 'taking', 'Gators', 'shrimp', 'hundreds', 'snakes', 'bringing', 'hundreds', 'dollars', 'snake', 'Dog', 'Swamp', 'People', 'are', 'too', 'close', 'present', 'state', 'American', 'electorate', 'be', 'positive', 'examples', 'be', 'tough', 'good', 'guy', 'keep', 'government', 'picture', 'do', ""n't"", 'tax', 'rich', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'reading', 'thinking', 'stuff', 'be', 'God-fearing', 'patriotic', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'be', 'assured', 'success', 'endeavor', 'Billy', 'would', 'be', 'stronger', 'reality', 'show', 'character', 'Billy', 'brother', 'Ricky', 'were', 'more', 'sharply', 'delineated', 'better', 'established', 'Billy', 'chest-out', 'charismatic', 'reassuring', 'swagger', 'gentle', 'voice', 'simply', ""n't"", 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'human', 'generous', 'present', 'kind', 'pale', 'shadow', 'show', 'main', 'exterminator-hero', 'gentler', 'not', 'firmer', 'more', 'stable', 'dressing', 'up', 'clothes', 'resembling', 'Billy', 'merely', 'wannabe', 'persona', 'Wisely', 'directors', 'Dog', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'make', 'Dog', 'daughter', 'look', 'gangsta-rapper', 'wild', 'girl', 'more', 'convincing', 'independent', 'character', 'producers', 'Billy', 'could', 'make', 'Ricky', 'become', 'brains', 'operation', 'getting', 'read', 'up', 'study', 'pests', 'then', 'share', 'expertise', 'character', 'might', 'become', 'convincing', 'cerebral', 'complement', 'Billy', 'more', 'physical', 'persona', 'bit', 'downer', 'see', 'snake', 'be', 'told', 'snake', 'mention', 'species', 'Notice', 'number', 'other', 'shows', 'successfully', 'combine', 'intuitive', 'hunkish', 'brawn', 'anti-heroic', 'not', 'non-heroic', 'yet', 'admirable', 'nerds', 'geeks', 'Billy', 'copy-cat', 'practically', 'exterminated', 'show', 'eponymous', 'character']",N/A
