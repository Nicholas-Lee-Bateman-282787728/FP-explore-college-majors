I was a fan of her tv show friends and when a star goes from tv to thebig screen i'm always wondering what kind of film they're going to give her. This is a good comedy...and the camera shot focusing in on her picture perfect seem all to surreal and the tightly wrapped dresses which seem to be made just for her,add to this effect. Oh yes the movie. It does begin in the advertising world and her associations there in but it doesnt stay in that serious world..the film decides to stay light and comedic. The comedy and sexual innuendos throughout are not forced but nicely done and the film moves effortlessly. Everyone seems to like this film..and its a film which suits its star. The film actually has all kinds of romantic subplots which is what the film is actuaaly about,and its a lot of fun. You wont find a better star for company...the watch sequences at the end of the film is a riot. Very good writing in this vein.

Unfortunately, I just can't.  This movie just isn't that good.Aniston plays a woman named Kate who is a young and ambitious advertising executive.  She has great ideas and tremendous potential, but the only thing holding her back is that her boss thinks that she doesn't have enough strings attached.  The fact that she's young, single, and debt-free makes him skeptical about whether or not she'll be a loyal employee, or whether she might one day decide to work for some other advertising company and take this company's clients with her.  The company has just landed a big account with a mustard company, and though she deserves to be part of the team that works on this account, Kate is excluded because of her boss' skepticism about her personal future.  Kate's friend and colleague at the company gets a hold of a Polaroid picture that Kate took with Nick, the camera man at a friend's wedding, and passes him off as her fianc&eacute; in front of the boss in order to get Kate put on the team.  Though she's hesitant, Kate goes along with this, and everything seems to be going well until the boss asks her to invite her fianc&eacute; to have dinner with him and his wife.  Kate meets with Nick and convinces him to come have dinner with her boss and pretend that he's her fianc&eacute;.  Nick decides to help her out by playing along with this charade, but in the process, he develops feelings for Kate which he hopes she will reciprocate.There's also a subplot involving another fellow colleague named Sam (Kevin Bacon) who Kate is smitten with.  Though she's dropped plenty of hints about wanting to date him, Sam is only attracted to ""bad girls,"" and Kate doesn't quite fit the bill.  Kate also uses this charade to seduce Sam, and though she succeeds, he doesn't turn up to be what she thought he'd be.I think that ""Friends"" is one of the greatest sitcoms ever made, and I love all the actors on that show.  However, none of them have ever had any great success on the big screen, and this movie gets through right into the pile of movie flops by those six loveable actors on the show.  There are a few mildly funny spots here and there, but not enough to warrant the purchase of this DVD.  If you're curious, I recommend you go and rent this movie, but it's definitely not worth the price of buying it.",2,"I Love Jennifer Aniston, But This Movie Isn't Worth It",1043798400,"01 29, 2003",2003,2445,"['love', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'love', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'obtained', 'movie', 'aspirations', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'good.Aniston', 'woman', 'named', 'Kate', 'who', 'young', 'ambitious', 'advertising', 'executive', 'great', 'ideas', 'tremendous', 'potential', 'only', 'thing', 'holding', 'back', 'boss', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'strings', 'attached', 'fact', 'young', 'single', 'debt-free', 'skeptical', 'not', ""'ll"", 'be', 'loyal', 'employee', 'might', 'one', 'day', 'decide', 'work', 'other', 'advertising', 'company', 'take', 'company', 'clients', 'company', 'just', 'landed', 'big', 'account', 'mustard', 'company', 'be', 'part', 'team', 'account', 'Kate', 'excluded', 'boss', 'skepticism', 'personal', 'future', 'Kate', 'friend', 'colleague', 'company', 'hold', 'Polaroid', 'picture', 'Kate', 'took', 'Nick', 'camera', 'man', 'friend', 'wedding', 'off', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'front', 'boss', 'order', 'get', 'Kate', 'put', 'team', 'hesitant', 'Kate', 'along', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'boss', 'invite', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'have', 'dinner', 'wife', 'Kate', 'Nick', 'come', 'have', 'dinner', 'boss', 'pretend', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Nick', 'help', 'out', 'playing', 'along', 'charade', 'process', 'feelings', 'Kate', 'will', 'reciprocate.There', 'also', 'subplot', 'involving', 'fellow', 'colleague', 'named', 'Sam', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'Kate', 'smitten', 'dropped', 'plenty', 'hints', 'wanting', 'date', 'Sam', 'only', 'attracted', 'bad', 'girls', 'Kate', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'bill', 'Kate', 'also', 'charade', 'seduce', 'Sam', ""n't"", 'turn', 'up', 'be', 'what', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be.I', 'think', 'Friends', 'one', 'greatest', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'made', 'love', 'actors', 'show', 'However', 'none', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'great', 'success', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'right', 'pile', 'movie', 'flops', 'six', 'loveable', 'actors', 'show', 'are', 'few', 'mildly', 'funny', 'spots', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'enough', 'warrant', 'purchase', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'curious', 'recommend', 'go', 'rent', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'price', 'buying']",N/A

159785,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0793948053,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 3]","Picture Perfect was far from it. The two-dimensional cardboard characters played out a stale, predictable drama, giving wooden delivery of a script that was riddled with clich&eacute;s. This was a Jennifer Aniston vehicle, which sends out warning bells right off the bat. She is cute, funny, likeable, but unless she's given the right material, the results have most often been disastrous. I think someday she is going to hit, like Sandra Bullock did in Blindside. Those two are like America's Sweethearts, but then their men do them wrong, and everyone takes their side. John Mayer, Brad Pitt, Jesse James, Vince Vaughn--actually, Vince Vaughn came to her rescue and then they broke up. People weren't so mad at Vince; they probably thought that she was too good for him anyway. He was kind of a rebound guy, and then when she was over Brad, he stepped aside. Then they made a movie called The Break-Up. I bet that movie was way better than Picture Perfect. Besides, you get to see a lot more of Jennifer in The Break-Up, if you catch my drift. If The Break-Up was on video, and they were selling it at the Good Will for 75 cents I would be reviewing that movie instead. But it wasn't at the Good Will, Picture Perfect was.Jennifer Aniston should never wear backwards baseball caps. She just can't carry off that look. I was watching The Big Bang the other day, and Penny was wearing a backwards baseball cap, and on her it worked. For all I know, she wore it in homage to Jennifer, but on her it worked. Jennifer Aniston was Rachel Green on friends, and while that show was hot, all the girls wanted her hair do. Women were going into the beauty shop and asking for a Rachel. Aniston was great on Friends, but even though she was a good actress, and funny, she was not a good enough actress to convince anyone that she would be with someone like Ross, even if he was her lobster. The same lack of credibility haunts Picture Perfect. Her character, Kate Mosley, wants to be with Sam Mayfair (Kevin Bacon).Bacon has never been less appetizing. He seems like a cold blooded reptile slithering about--he looks like the skeleton on Tales From the Crypt. I like Kevin Bacon a lot as an actor and as the focal point of the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, but in Picture Perfect he isn't a credible love interest, and his acting isn't so great, either.Jay Mohr can be really funny if he is in the right situation, but this wasn't that situation. Here he is supposed to be the good guy that Kate Mosley ignores while chasing after Bacon's bad boy. It is just not a good fit for his talents. I will say though that he made the best of a bad situation, and by the end of the movie I was actually buying him. Just like he won over Kate Mosley, he managed to make me care. I do not like his latest TV show, Gary Unmarried. Hasn't that been canceled yet? What I did like was when he played Peter Dragon in Action. He makes a great smart aleck character. Action was a great show, but it only made it through 13 episodes.Illeana Douglas was also on that show, and she was utterly fantastic on it. Illeana's talent was wasted on Picture Perfect. She has all the good lines, and delivers them well, but there just aren't that many good lines in Picture Perfect.------------Darcy: I was so excited I could barely keep my legs together.=================Given her limited role, she really stood out. She just wasn't given enough to do.Olympia Dukakis plays Rita Mosley, Kate's mom. She is doing a good job, but her role is an all too familiar clich&eacute;. I like it that she is a beautician, and she does Kate's hair while they have a mother/daughter chat. Later, Kate is doing Rita's hair. Cute.The Bottom Line is that Picture Perfect is a not very good example of a romantic comedy. Near the end of the movie I started to care, and Jay Mohr and Jennifer Aniston started to have a little chemistry. But it was too little, too late. Aniston is one Blindside away from reaching the top again, but she should be careful to avoid anything remotely resembling Picture Perfect.------------Kate Mosley: Sam, you're always going to be the guy at the restaurant, who, when he gets what he ordered, decides he wants what the other guy has instead.=====================Life Is Hot In Cracktown(2009) Illeana Douglas was MommyManagement(2008) Jennifer Aniston was SueThe Break-Up (Widescreen Edition)(2006) Jennifer Aniston was Brooke MeyersThe Adventures of Pluto Nash(2002) Jay Mohr was Tony Francis; Illeana Douglas was Dr. Mona ZimmerJane Austen's Mafia!

While it is noteworthy to point out the strong female character that Jennifer Aniston plays, the script eventually falls into the classic mold of misconstrued circumstances leading (hopefully) to outright laughter.  While the laughs never really come, the romance between Mrs. Aniston and Jay Mohr is charged with some believable chemistry.  These two people really like each other, and not just platonically.  Some of the potential laughs are forced, like every scene involving Olympia Dukakis and her loud over-acting.  Kevin Bacon really doesn't come across as a believable love-interest, either.  It would have been better had he been a complete slimeball.  There are no characters to either love nor hate, and only the lead female character to admire; and for all the heterosexual men in the world, only Jay Mohr's character to envy.  Jennifer Aniston eventually has to carry this film until Jay Mohr shows up, so the first 30 minutes are laborious.

The initial premise is somewhat hackneyed in that Kate (Anniston) is an obviously talented employee at Mercer Advertising.  She is quick and full of ideas and an absolute dream person.  Yet, after coming up with the killer idea that gains a large account for her company, she is flatly told that she can't work on the account.  Why?  Because she isn't married, driving an expensive car or struggling with a house payment she can't afford.  Her boss (wonderful Kevin Dunn) insists that there is nothing holding her to the company and she therefore can't rise.If you don't know, this is a dream, open and shut case for any civil attorney.  A blatant act of discrimination.Kate goes off to a wedding, and has her picture taken with Nick (Mohr) the photographer.  Her co-worker gets the idea to lie to Mercer saying Kate is engaged to Nick and that wins her the promotion that she deserves.  All is well until Nick saves a child from a burning building and prompts Mercer to ask to meet Nick.  So Kate offers to pay Nick to pretend he's her fiancee, then pick a fight and break up with her.All is well until Nick actually falls for Kate.Other than the implausible concept that gives the movie its start, this is a warm and truly engaging film that will have you watching over and over.

I'm taking a wild guess and saying this was filmed between series three & four. I think. (Does this give me an excuse to watch them again?!)Jennifer Aniston takes the role of a person who is willing to do anything just to get a guy - anything?! I know, so many options, so little time. Doing this, she must break another guy's heart. Aw, what a shame. It's been done before in these kinda movies, it's nothing new. And you wanna know what the worst thing is? The guy she wants, is Kevin Bacon, who only sleeps with women who are otherwise attached, to other men. Talk about a commitment-phobe! And the other, who's heart she breaks, is Jay Mohr. Yes I know, that's what I said, who? Between these two guys, neither of them has one iota of cute guy-ness. And one is Kevin Bacon. Enough to spook me out after his performance in Hollow Man. An unforgettable performance in my eyes. One that will haunt me for the rest of my life.If it wasn't for Friends, then I'm guessing Jennifer Aniston wouldn't have much luck in Hollywood, and she may not have caught Brad Pitt's eye. Who knows. You can watch each series of Friends (now THERE'S something to do next time my boyfriend threatens to put on Indiana Jones) and see how much her fashion sense, and makeup get better. Two or three years after Friends, her style leaves little to be desired. None of her movies have been that outstanding, although The Good Girl comes pretty close but in my eyes she's done better than the rest of the Friends cast put together (Lost In Space anyone?)The storyline may be slightly dodgy, but you can't fault Jennifer Aniston in it. True, she's Rachel, but she has been in nearly all the movies she's done, and her and all the Friends cast will always be known for their characters.

He spends much of the movie with  &quot;Puppy Dog Eyes&quot; for Jennifer but holds his ground.  Excellent  change from his role in Jerry McGuire.Basic story is Girl (Kate) wants  Boy (Sam) and job recognition, girl isn't getting either.  Girl's friend  leads people to believe that she is engaged to another boy (Jay playing  Nick) who she has only met once at a wedding.  Nick gets famous and Kate's  life gets complicated.  She tries to get Nick to come play the part (for  money, which he refuses) and he agrees to &quot;come to dinner&quot;.  Meanwhile Nick is falling hard for Kate but she doesn't want it.  Or does  she?  As with many real life situations she doesn't realize what she is  missing until it is to late (or is it?).

This flick is perhaps what made Ms. Aniston more a ""movie-star"" than her sit-com character, and it is easy to see how she made the leap.  Jenny not only plays a sexy and hot-to-trot corporate, rather shallow advertising exec-wannabe, but also a rather wholesome, down-to-earth, and deeply desiring (but not aware of it), ""good girl"" who only wants to be truly loved for who she really is.Jay Mohr is equally as good because in this film, he doesn't play his usual smarmy, over the top ""bad guy,"" but instead gives a low key but effective performance as a rather normal, photography and art loving, ""good guy,"" who eventually falls head over heels for Jennifer during an elaborate scheme by the latter to ""use"" Jay to further her corporate ambitions.Kevin Bacon is a fellow corporate riser who is both a good guy and a bad guy, good in that he eventually comes to see Jennifer as something more decent and deep than he thought, but bad so in the way he seems to use Jen in a casual sex way.  During the movie, all the characters behave as real people, and all evolve, leading to a very pleasing, linear story that pulls heavily on all of our most cynical strings where ""true love"" and values in life are concerned.Fast paced, with excellent performances and dialogue, and with pretty good insights into various NYC corporate characters and what makes them tick, this is one movie whose heart in the end is in the right place.  Somewhat a modern day twist on 1960's Best Picture ""The Apartment"" (one of my top ten all time films), there's a truly special blend of comedy and drama, and we generally ""care"" for everyone here in the end.  And the end, which I won't give away, is just about picture ""perfect.""While the film does have some confusing elements at times, and seems to swell at times with a bit overly done melodrama, almost everyting else about it is a series of well done, well scripted, well directed scenes, with some pretty good and timely music as well.
