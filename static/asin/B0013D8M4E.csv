So we all know that we want to see the original series on dvd, but for now this is what we have. No, it wasn't perfect. Kind of a weak plot, and I never really cared for Charles Franks' take on being a Maverick, but this show was really helped by having James Garner and Jack Kelly in it. James has always been the favorite of mine as far as the 4 Mavericks, but Jack still looked good after all those years, and did a fine job here (albeit short)! And while Susan Sullivan was no match for Jodie Foster (1994 Maverick Movie, Annabelle) she did a good job! All in all a decent movie.
