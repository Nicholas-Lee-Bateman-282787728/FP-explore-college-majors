If not, I plan to.Jim Chee (Adam Beach) is a Navajo policeman who was giving a girl a ride to work when he got a call from another officer, Delbert Nez, that indicated he needed help, but didn't seem to make any sense. Also, Chee couldn't hear it well enough to know what was going on. Nevertheless, when he finds Nez dead in his burning police car, Chee suffers in two ways: he feels guilty for not getting there sooner, and he burns his hand pretty severely on the handle of the burning car getting Nez's body out.On his way out of the side road where all this took place, Chee comes upon a drunken old man, Ashie Pinto, and assumes he is responsible for Nez's death. But once Pinto is in jail, and his clan all insist he could not possibly be guilty, Chee and his partner Joe Leaphorn (Wes Studi) investigate.

793937,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00015YVPO,C. O. DeRiemer,"[14, 15]","Years ago Robert Redford bought the screen rights to a bunch of Tony Hillerman mysteries. He's been the force behind one movie (The Dark Wind, 1991, with Lou Diamond Phillips and Fred Ward as Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn) and three television movies, all with Adam Beach as Chee and Wes Studi as Leaphorn (American Mystery! Special: Skinwalkers, 2002; Coyote Waits, 2003; andA Thief of Time, 2004). Redford has yet to get it right.Coyote Waits is the best of the TV movies, but it suffers from the same conscientious flaws that mar the other three productions. It's best to remind ourselves just why Hillerman's mysteries are so good: They are complex yet believable; are set in what, for most Americans, is an exotic locale within a culture which is not well known; and the mysteries are superbly constructed and well written. Hillerman educates us along the way -- if we want to be educated -- about Navajo people, customs, history and the Navajo belief system. He makes clear the tension between modern needs and traditional values, but he does it matter-of-factly, with no preaching, and always within the context of the mystery he's telling.Redford and his team almost perversely get it backward. More than any of the other flaws, it's the reverential treatment given to the Navajo and their land that sinks these movies into culturally-approved lessons. Instead of trusting the audience to take up what they will and learn from it or not, as Hillerman does, we have sweeping camera vistas of the land at dramatic moments; a generically sensitive ""ethnic"" score that tries to tell us what we should be appreciating in the Navajo belief system; and a need to cram in so many plot points from the books with messages about Navajo issues that the mysteries themselves become disorganized.Coyote Waits eventually settles down to a better than average telling of Hillerman's story, which involves a ruthless search for old bones. A great deal of money and an enhanced reputation are the prizes. There's murder and avarice, rattlesnakes and Bolivian coins and the continuing conflict within Chee over his job as a cop and his gifts as a healer. Chee and the older Leaphorn wind up working together but on parallel aspects of the case. It makes for a neat way to keep the two different men prominent in the solution. The director and writer have managed with partial success to keep the focus on the story. Coyote Waits is far more coherent and with less of the reverential stuff that so marred, in my opinion, Skinwalkers and The Thief of Time.You might want to give The Dark Wind a try. Phillips makes an interesting, if young, Chee. The movie, however, also keeps getting sidetracked into overly respectful appreciation of the Navajo way. The Navajo deserve better...which they get in the Hillerman books.The only extra worth noting is a ""making of"" piece that features shots on location and brief interviews with the production crew, Hillerman, Beach and Studi. It serves up the same cloying flaws as the TV movie. People keep telling us how honored they are to be working on the program and how wonderful PBS is to be a partner in making the production possible. This is the same PBS that gave us the 10 p.m. ""safe harbor"" and that had the vapors over a real soldier in a real war (in Ken Burns' WWII documentary) saying a curse word. Please, folks, enough is enough.I give this movie a better-than-average rating because, even with the movie's flaws, the team tried to do a better job. When they concentrated on the mystery, the movie works reasonably well.",4,"Some grating flaws, but the mystery itself works reasonably well.

What makes Hillerman's books so wonderful is that he portrays Navajo culture with such profound authenticity. But in this film, Hillerman's Navajo characters were transformed into cardboard cutouts, and the culture that Hillerman so skillfully conveyed was reduced to some flute music and close-ups of elders telling old myths. However, even the stereotyped image of the wrinkled elder in braids recounting the ways of the ancestors looked pretty good compared to the completely lifeless acting. Adam Beach was horribly miscast as the traditionalist Navajo, Jim Chee. He slurred his way through his lines and couldn't even muster one convincing scene. Sheila Tousey, as Emma, sounded like she was reading her lines from a prompter. Wes Studi, as Leaphorn, was marginally better, but he only had one facial expression--hard-boiled cop.

The movie is, naturally far from the experience of reading a book.Secondly, I loathe most mysteries, so I won't touch that from an artistic point of view though I'm a writer. I'm not a Hillerman fan, I read him on my mom's insistence that I try - she was right.This has little of the things I hate about mysteries, so maybe mystery fans won't like it? That is - ghastly old houses, butlers, missing heirlooms, overdressed heroines in fur and diamonds, jealous heirs, and bad weather ... crooked cops, gory emotional scenes of murder ... without which, I suppose, the mystery would not be worth pursuing?Coyote has - yes, a lot of Navajo culture, yes, some of it gets explained for us White ignoramuses. So? We ARE uneducated about other races, liberal media or not - and there were something like 500 Nations of Amerinds. Even U.S. regional cultures can seem alien, and especially so over 100 years or so ago ... so why would someone criticize Coyote (or Hillerman) for showboating the culture/setting that he builds tales in? Eeek.The story was interesting. Some of it seemed awkward, as far as forcing the plot and having stereotypical reactions to things, but this could be (is?) the producer's fault? I don't see any cliche or racially stereotyped stuff in the novels. Scenery was lovely at times - and I thought relevant. If you are ignorant of Indian beliefs it could seem excessive ...But, when Chee or others gather a medicine pouch and stand to face the 4 directions or a span of red rocks - that is like invoking God and facing the altar. Or for a Catholic or Buddhist, facing the holy relics and then going ahead to pray. It fits the characters.I disliked what felt like a forced ending. I won't spoil it, but I felt the old Indian could have disclosed more of his thinking so we could follow the story better. His actions seemed senselessly obtuse, or alcohol poisoned - then he suddenly gets coherent?Overall though, I liked the twists and interplay of characters.

He injures his hand trying to rescue his friend and blames himself for Delbert's death, reconsidering his decision to be a cop.Joe Leaphorn (Studi) didn't want to be involved in this case at all.  Ashi Pinto (Jimmy Herman) who is arrested for the murder is kin to his wife, Emma (Sheila Tousey). She's not going to let a kinsman be framed.This puts Chee and Leaphorn at odds momentarily until they opt to work together.  Wonderful reappearance of Graham Greene as the tribal Christian reverand and taxi-cab driver.  Overall, this is a well done film and worth seeing.See also the other two films based on this series:A Thief of TimeAmerican Mystery!
