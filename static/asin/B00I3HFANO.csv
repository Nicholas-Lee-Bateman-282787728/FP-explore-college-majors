However, there has got to be someone watching these and thinking, ""Why are we still wasting money on this?!""  It's really not that hard.  But I ramble.  The movie, in itself, could have been a fairly entertaining one, but the problem lies with EVERYTHING involved (with the exception of the film/visual quality).  Let's start with the writing.  They spend so much time trying to trick the audience with the whole ""who-done-it"" they failed to actually make an interesting story.  For starters, we have the whole crew going to a cabin in the woods for some sort of bachelor/bachelorette party.  Not sure who does that, but whatever.  They arrive to the most outrageous groundskeeper in history.  He basically yells at them to do everything his way, even though he's RENTING the cabin,.and for what seems like an insane amount of money at that.  More of what you'd expect continues to happen and even things you don't expect (and don't care about).  Every male character in this movie is a waste of acting time, as they are all horrible.  The women aren't any better.  Plain and simple, this movie has terrible writing, terrible acting, and a terrible storyline.  The continued ""twists"" that are thrown in don't do it any favors as they just make the writers seem more desperate to try and hold our attention.Final Verdict:  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!If my review has helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking ""yes"" below.",1,Yet another terrible movie gets made.,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,1557,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'movies', 'get', 'green', 'light', ""'m"", 'not', 'industry', 'aspect', 'process', 'completely', 'lost', 'However', 'got', 'be', 'someone', 'watching', 'thinking', 'Why', 'are', 'still', 'wasting', 'money', 'really', 'not', 'hard', 'ramble', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'one', 'problem', 'EVERYTHING', 'involved', 'exception', 'film/visual', 'quality', 'Let', 'start', 'writing', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'trying', 'trick', 'audience', 'whole', 'who-done-it', 'failed', 'actually', 'make', 'interesting', 'story', 'starters', 'have', 'whole', 'crew', 'going', 'cabin', 'woods', 'sort', 'bachelor/bachelorette', 'party', 'Not', 'sure', 'who', 'arrive', 'most', 'outrageous', 'groundskeeper', 'history', 'basically', 'do', 'everything', 'way', 'even', 'cabin', '.and', 'what', 'insane', 'amount', 'money', 'More', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'happen', 'even', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'male', 'character', 'movie', 'waste', 'acting', 'time', 'are', 'horrible', 'women', 'are', ""n't"", 'better', 'Plain', 'simple', 'movie', 'terrible', 'writing', 'terrible', 'acting', 'terrible', 'storyline', 'continued', 'twists', 'are', 'thrown', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'favors', 'just', 'make', 'writers', 'seem', 'more', 'desperate', 'try', 'hold', 'attention.Final', 'Verdict', 'AVOID', 'AT', 'ALL', 'COSTS', 'review', 'helped', 'way', 'please', 'let', 'know', 'clicking', 'yes']",Death Do Us Part

1693321,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00I3HFANO,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[3, 3]","After nearly three decades of movie viewing, I can offer this warning to all moviegoers everywhere: if a film starts with a group of people driving to a retreat, resort, vacation, or cabin while they banter with dialogue explicitly designed to show how different they all are, there's a 95% chance you're in for a dismal viewing experience. I've watched a lot of crappy movies, and this one trope seems to be the most common thread among them. It's like the iron lung of plot devices.This movie features three guys and three girls all headed to a cabin in the woods to have a combined bachelor/bachelorette party before two of them get married. That's plot hole number one, right there. Plot hole number two pops up about ten minutes into the film when it becomes clear that none of these people like each other. This is not an exaggeration. Every single character seems to hate every other character, even the soon-to-be-wed. Not that I blame them; there isn't a likeable character in the bunch. You have the groom (a sleazeball with a secret or two), his best man (a sleazeball with an eight year old's sense of humor), and an old buddy from the past (a sleazeball in need of fast cash). The three females are nearly indistinguishable physically except they each have different colored hair. There's the bride (a loony-tune who actually brought her wedding dress to the cabin for no discernible reason), her sister (a lady with jealousy issues), and the bride's best friend (a blonde woman who appears to suffer from a rare form of functional autism).Okay, wait. I strike my earlier comment. The blonde is the only likeable character, but that's just because she wanders through the script with an almost aggressive innocence, constantly watching the others fight or commit certain salacious deeds with a huge gasping look on her face.This is all topped by the cabin's caretaker, a hulking mouth-breather who is trying so hard to be creepy and menacing that he may as well be named Red Herring. He pops up constantly in ways that barely make sense, including his constant demands that the revelers don't ""trash the place."" Sounds like someone's been reading Renting Your Cabin For Dummies. In a moment of unintentional hilarity, he breaks into the cabin and accuses them of trashing the place because the table is full of bottles of booze and they are playing loud music.At this point, it's pitch black outside and everyone decides to have a scavenger hunt in the scraggly woods where they pair off and go looking for things like edible underwear, which sounds like what a prepubescent kid imagines adults do during bachelor parties. Ludicrously, most of them are game for this, and they head out into the dark forest and start to get stabbed and hacked with axes. Cue: screaming and running and paranoia.What's weird is that the production values on this thing aren't all that bad, and even though it feels like the dialogue was written for a first year screenwriting class, the script actually tries to be clever with its secrets. Astute viewers won't have a lot of trouble guessing who the baddie is, especially if they notice how hard the movie tries to disguise that fact, but it's still kind of a nice change of pace considering how idiotic the rest of it is. There's even some decent cinematography and B-roll that, while shoehorned oddly into the film, demonstrate that there was some actual talent behind the lens.Unfortunately, story is more important than anything else, and this is, when all is said and slashed, a pretty crappy story. Horrible people saying horrible things and then getting killed. There's not a lot more to it than that.",2,Bride and Gloom,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,3653,"['nearly', 'three', 'decades', 'movie', 'viewing', 'can', 'offer', 'warning', 'moviegoers', 'everywhere', 'film', 'group', 'people', 'driving', 'retreat', 'resort', 'vacation', 'cabin', 'banter', 'dialogue', 'explicitly', 'designed', 'show', 'how', 'different', 'are', '95', '%', 'chance', ""'re"", 'dismal', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lot', 'crappy', 'movies', 'one', 'trope', 'be', 'most', 'common', 'thread', 'iron', 'lung', 'plot', 'devices.This', 'movie', 'features', 'three', 'guys', 'three', 'girls', 'headed', 'cabin', 'woods', 'have', 'combined', 'bachelor/bachelorette', 'party', 'two', 'get', 'married', 'plot', 'hole', 'number', 'one', 'right', 'there', 'Plot', 'hole', 'number', 'two', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'when', 'clear', 'none', 'people', 'other', 'not', 'exaggeration', 'single', 'character', 'hate', 'other', 'character', 'even', 'soon-to-be-wed.', 'Not', 'blame', ""n't"", 'likeable', 'character', 'bunch', 'have', 'groom', 'sleazeball', 'secret', 'two', 'best', 'man', 'sleazeball', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'sense', 'humor', 'old', 'buddy', 'past', 'sleazeball', 'need', 'fast', 'cash', 'three', 'females', 'are', 'nearly', 'indistinguishable', 'physically', 'have', 'different', 'colored', 'hair', 'bride', 'loony-tune', 'who', 'actually', 'brought', 'wedding', 'dress', 'cabin', 'discernible', 'reason', 'sister', 'lady', 'jealousy', 'issues', 'bride', 'best', 'friend', 'blonde', 'woman', 'who', 'suffer', 'rare', 'form', 'functional', 'autism', '.Okay', 'wait', 'strike', 'earlier', 'comment', 'blonde', 'only', 'likeable', 'character', 'just', 'script', 'almost', 'aggressive', 'innocence', 'constantly', 'watching', 'others', 'fight', 'commit', 'certain', 'salacious', 'deeds', 'huge', 'gasping', 'look', 'face.This', 'topped', 'cabin', 'caretaker', 'hulking', 'mouth-breather', 'who', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'creepy', 'menacing', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'named', 'Red', 'Herring', 'up', 'constantly', 'ways', 'barely', 'make', 'sense', 'including', 'constant', 'demands', 'revelers', 'do', ""n't"", 'trash', 'place', 'someone', 'been', 'reading', 'Renting', 'Cabin', 'Dummies', 'moment', 'unintentional', 'hilarity', 'cabin', 'trashing', 'place', 'table', 'full', 'bottles', 'booze', 'are', 'playing', 'loud', 'music.At', 'point', 'pitch', 'black', 'outside', 'everyone', 'decides', 'have', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'scraggly', 'woods', 'where', 'pair', 'off', 'go', 'looking', 'things', 'edible', 'underwear', 'what', 'prepubescent', 'kid', 'imagines', 'adults', 'do', 'bachelor', 'parties', 'Ludicrously', 'most', 'are', 'game', 'head', 'out', 'dark', 'forest', 'start', 'get', 'stabbed', 'hacked', 'axes', 'Cue', 'screaming', 'running', 'paranoia.What', 'weird', 'production', 'values', 'thing', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'dialogue', 'was', 'written', 'first', 'year', 'screenwriting', 'class', 'script', 'actually', 'be', 'clever', 'secrets', 'Astute', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'trouble', 'guessing', 'who', 'baddie', 'especially', 'notice', 'how', 'hard', 'movie', 'disguise', 'fact', 'still', 'kind', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'considering', 'how', 'idiotic', 'rest', 'even', 'decent', 'cinematography', 'B-roll', 'shoehorned', 'oddly', 'film', 'demonstrate', 'was', 'actual', 'talent', 'lens.Unfortunately', 'story', 'more', 'important', 'anything', 'else', 'when', 'said', 'slashed', 'pretty', 'crappy', 'story', 'Horrible', 'people', 'saying', 'horrible', 'things', 'then', 'getting', 'killed', 'not', 'lot', 'more']",Death Do Us Part
1693322,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00I3HFANO,Matthew Scott Baker,"[1, 2]","If you are married, there&#8217;s a good chance you are familiar with the intense stress that comes from planning a wedding.  The tension usually weighs more heavily on the bride, which is a key element to director Nicholas Humphries&#8217; recent release, DEATH DO US PART.  In this film, bride-to-be Kennedy is whisked away with her fiancee and some friends to a cabin for a weekend stag party.  But the party&#8217;s over pretty quickly, and the body count racks up fast.  This fun and entertaining slasher will keep you guessing, right up to the very end.I am happily surprised by this film.  I hadn&#8217;t heard of it prior to seeing the press release, so I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect.  The director&#8217;s resume is hefty on short films, however this is his first full-length feature.  But I&#8217;m glad to report Humphries does an excellent job with this debut.  The movie is made well for the most part and delivers on several levels.DEATH DO US PART is shot well and appears to have a high production value.  The acting is superb with Peter Benson and Julia Benson (who are married in real life) heading up a great cast.  Peter and Julia play off of each other with amazing ease, probably due in part to their real life relationship.  The rest of the cast does a great job as well, although I have to particularly single out Emilie Ullerup.  I have been a fan of her work since 2008 when I first saw her in the Syfy Channel show SANCTUARY, and she certainly does not disappoint here, either.  I hope to see more of her in the future.The story is a lot of fun, and I especially like how the intrigue hangs in the air for the duration of the film.  The characters have to deal with the killings, but they also have to figure out who is behind them.  Is it the creepy caretaker?  Is it someone in their own group?  The paranoia is high, which keeps the audience guessing and makes this film a thrill-ride of epic proportions.  I have to applaud the script writers for the ending, as well&#8230;I can honestly say I did not see it coming.Although DEATH DO US PART is very entertaining, I do have two minor complaints that I must voice.  First, there is drastic lack of continuity in the opening shots regarding the vehicle in which the group is traveling.  The truck is a light shade, like white or tan, and at various times, it is so splattered with mud that you barely see the paint; but in the next scene, it&#8217;s been through a car wash and no mud is visible.  But then we transition again and see the mud is back.  This is a small thing to mention, but it really stands out since the vehicle is a light color.Second, the special effects were a little on the weak side.  At one point, a character gets a couple of fingers chopped off.  This person turns to look at the stump of hand, which should be awesome&#8230;but a flashlight beam catches the hand and the light goes through the rubber, illuminating the hand like a Halloween pumpkin.  This obviously looks very fake, although again, it is a minor point.Still, DEATH DO US PART is a load of fun, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good slasher or even thriller.  There&#8217;s a lot to be thankful for here, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what director Humphries does in the future.
