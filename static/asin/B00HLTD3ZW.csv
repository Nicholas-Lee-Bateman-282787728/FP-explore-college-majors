What follows is a climax so laughably politically correct, so outrageously anti-American that you can feel a list being checked off by the filmmakers to ensure no foreign box-office revenue was lost due to religious or ethnic sensitivities.SPOILER ALERTThe bad guys in this film aren't Islamic terrorists. They're -- of course -- US combat veterans. And not just any US combat veterans either -- one of them happened to lose their father on 9/11. And they're not happy about our airline security, to the point where they (seriously) decide to extort money from Neeson's character (a drunken air marshal) and then take the whole plane down with every passenger along with it.Nope, I'm not kidding. This has to be a new low for Hollywood, managing to insult American servicemen and the memory of 9/11 on top of it. Perhaps the presence of the French company Studio Canal -- which funded this picture -- has to do with its politics, but it not only renders the end of this movie laughable, but it's also downright insulting to service people who have suffered from PTSD.Oh, and there's one Muslim character in this film -- and, of course, he's a kindly doctor.

1690359,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00HLTD3ZW,Anthony L.,"[0, 0]","I can only imagine the pitch Jaume Collet-Seura gave the studio execs for Non-Stop: ""So, we've got Liam Neeson, who played that grumpy, lovable old badass in Taken and The Grey, and he's playing a grumpy, lovable old badass in this one. And he's on a plane. And there's this terrorist, texting him. Yes, a texting terrorist. And he's got to find him, and kill him. No, his daughter's not kidnapped."" The average moviegoer could be forgiven for thinking Non-Stop to be another typical dumb actioner. Turns out that Non Stop is a riveting, stylish, action-packed mystery that will keep you guessing in a feverish state of paranoia from liftoff to touch down (I promise to keep plane puns to a minimum).First off, the cast is excellent. What can I say about Liam Neeson, except that the curmudgeonly old Irish badass with a voice like a lion gargling with molten gold (that sounds dumb, and I apologize) is on TOP FORM once more, bringing his singular stature and gravitas and particular set of skills. His fellow passengers include Julianne Moore, who will beguile you with her charm, and simultaneously make you suspicious of her true intentions. Also along for the ride is Michelle Dockery, who will beguile you with her charm, and simultaneously make you suspicious of her true intentions. Fellow passenger Anson Mount will beguile you-- I think you get the point. Like I said before, the cast is great, and turns in a plane-load of excellent performances. Look for Anson Mount and Corey Stoll for stand-outs.The cinematography is excellent, with the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne emphasizing the themes of the film with subtle allusion to the BLAH BLAH BLAH. While Non-Stop DOES look really great, and has its own cool, unique visual style, I'm sure you don't care. You want to see Liam Neeson snap people's necks, fight with dudes in bathrooms, growl at people in his warm voice, and of course, fly lengthwise down a plane while simultaneously firing a handgun...ALL of which he does in this movie. As an added bonus, he even has an good ol' Arnie-style one-liner, which I won't spoil for you here.On the whole, Non-Stop is surprisingly intense, with a fast-paced, twisty plot that keeps you guessing and staring at random extras through the corners of your eyes saying, ""It could be YOU, homely Filipino grandmother!"" OK, maybe not to that extent. But still. The script does take a few preposterous turns (including an utterly inexplicable motive for the bad guy), but it drags every ounce of plane-related suspense out of its premise. The action is great, real and ruthless - none of this kung-fu baloney or CGI that plagues many blockbusters. Also, look forward to the edge-of-your-seat climax that will have you clenching your popcorn until it crumbles to a sticky dust. In conclusion, Non-Stop is a riveting, unpredictable, well-acted, stylish ride that will have you gripped non-stop (see what I did there?) from the opening scene to the end scene. And it may just put you off of air travel for a while.

I was actually surprised, because going in (having seen some interviews) I thought I had guessed who the villain was. I was so wrong! One of the best things about watching this was being totally surprised as the conclusion exploded (literally) into deadly clarity.Neeson, as the troubled Federal Air Marshal, is at his angst-filled yet lethal best. The scope of unfolding terror confined in such a small space gives the movie an unusual, even claustrophobic intensity.I can't remember actually being engrossed in a movie as much as this one. Usually I can browse my iPad while also following the movie on TV, but this time I had to give it my whole attention. Great entertainment experience!

1690367,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B00HLTD3ZW,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[5, 8]","Non-Stop starts out as a surprisingly tense thriller that relies on clever writing to carry it along. The film teases the audience with hints about Bill Marks's (Liam Neeson) past, some obvious and some subtle, to get us on his side. Once Marks receives the first fateful text message (""Are you prepared to do your duty tonight, Bill?""), Non-Stop is also frustratingly successful at bewildering the audience- just like it bewilders Marks. Who is sending the messages? Who can Marks trust? How is the perpetrator always one step ahead? I was so torn over who to suspect I even began to wonder if Marks had just lost his marbles!Again, the first hour or so of Non-Stop is beautifully written. The suspense is incredible (in large part due to the writers' preservation of plausibility... for awhile), and the audience is firmly behind Marks, though we are simultaneously sympathetic to the passengers who, not knowing anything more than what they see, admirably plan to take matters into their own hands. There are other clever tidbits sprinkled throughout, such as the inanity of the pundits on the news broadcast.So why three stars, then?Simple: the last fifteen minutes of this film is so silly in comparison to the first hour+ it is almost unfathomable. It's like the filmmakers realized they hadn't tapped most of their budget yet; the obvious solution, of course, was to then insert a slew of crazy action scenes that require expensive special effects and to fulfill a bunch of action movie stereotypes along the way for good measure. Nevermind that the intelligence we were treated to in the first half of the film has already bailed out of the aircraft.I like to keep my film reviews as spoiler free as possible, so I don't feel comfortable going into any more depth about the plot. However, I will say that Liam Neeson's undeniable charisma as a lead is on full display in Non-Stop, so fans of him are guaranteed to dig it. This is one of those solid films that is worth watching but ultimately leaves the audience longing for what could have been. Nevertheless, I did enjoy Non-Stop and can confidently recommend it both to fans of Neeson and fans of the genre (suspenseful action-thriller). Just be prepared for the out-of-place Hollywood finale.",3,Non-Stop Suspense,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,2254,"['Non-Stop', 'out', 'surprisingly', 'tense', 'thriller', 'clever', 'writing', 'carry', 'along', 'film', 'audience', 'hints', 'Bill', 'Marks', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'past', 'obvious', 'subtle', 'get', 'side', 'Once', 'Marks', 'first', 'fateful', 'text', 'message', 'Are', 'prepared', 'do', 'duty', 'tonight', 'Bill', 'Non-Stop', 'also', 'frustratingly', 'successful', 'bewildering', 'audience-', 'just', 'Marks', 'Who', 'sending', 'messages', 'Who', 'can', 'Marks', 'trust', 'How', 'perpetrator', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'was', 'so', 'torn', 'who', 'suspect', 'even', 'began', 'wonder', 'Marks', 'had', 'just', 'lost', 'marbles', 'Again', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'Non-Stop', 'beautifully', 'written', 'suspense', 'incredible', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'writers', 'preservation', 'plausibility', 'awhile', 'audience', 'firmly', 'Marks', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'sympathetic', 'passengers', 'who', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'more', 'what', 'see', 'admirably', 'plan', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'are', 'other', 'clever', 'tidbits', 'sprinkled', 'such', 'inanity', 'pundits', 'news', 'broadcast.So', 'why', 'three', 'stars', 'then', 'Simple', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'so', 'silly', 'comparison', 'first', 'hour+', 'almost', 'unfathomable', 'filmmakers', 'realized', 'had', ""n't"", 'tapped', 'most', 'budget', 'yet', 'obvious', 'solution', 'course', 'was', 'then', 'insert', 'slew', 'crazy', 'action', 'scenes', 'require', 'expensive', 'special', 'effects', 'fulfill', 'bunch', 'action', 'movie', 'way', 'good', 'measure', 'intelligence', 'were', 'treated', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'already', 'bailed', 'aircraft.I', 'keep', 'film', 'reviews', 'spoiler', 'free', 'possible', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'comfortable', 'going', 'more', 'depth', 'plot', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'undeniable', 'charisma', 'lead', 'full', 'display', 'Non-Stop', 'fans', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'dig', 'one', 'solid', 'films', 'worth', 'watching', 'ultimately', 'audience', 'longing', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Nevertheless', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Non-Stop', 'can', 'confidently', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Neeson', 'fans', 'genre', 'suspenseful', 'action-thriller', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'out-of-place', 'Hollywood', 'finale']",N/A

1690392,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00HLTD3ZW,Chris Kennison,"[2, 7]","Since 2008's &#8220;Taken&#8221;, Liam Neeson has stepped into the role of action hero numerous times and has done them well. The movies haven't always been anything to write home about, but something tells me that much of what Neeson has been doing has been keeping busy in the aftermath of the sudden death of his wife Natasha Richardson. He went from doing one or two movies a year, to doing 4 to 7 movies a year following her passing.With the exception of the original &#8220;Taken&#8221; and &#8220;The Dark Knight Rises&#8221;, Neeson's movies have failed to crack that threshold of mediocrity. The last time he ventured into the lone action hero genre with the terrible and capitalizing &#8220;Taken 2&#8221;, I figured it would be a while before he went there again. I was wrong. He's gone there again. He's not Bryan Mills from &#8220;Taken&#8221;, but Bill Marks, a washed up, slightly alcoholic air marshal with a bit of a mysterious past. He, according to the talk radio show he listens to before boarding the flight in the movie, has the easiest job in the federal government. Nothing ever happens on these flights; well, if that were the case, we wouldn't have a movie.&#8220;Non-Stop&#8221; is a mystery-action movie with an audience who has seen it all in mind. You know if you paid the price of admission that something bad is going to happen so the director throws numerous familiar faces at you to throw you off the scent. Usually, in most whodunnit's, when you see that 'actor' that you recognize, you know it's them and you're probably right. This time, the director, Jaume Collet-Serra, uses all kinds of people like Julianne Moore (the most recognizable), Scoot McNairy from &#8220;Argo&#8221; and dozens of other recent movies, Michelle Dockery from &#8220;Downtown Abbey&#8221;, Nate Parker from &#8220;Red Tails&#8221;, that guy from &#8220;House of Cards&#8221; who has the drug problem (Corey Stull), Lupita Nyong'o who just won an Oscar for &#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221;, Jason Butler Harner who you've seen in many many things, Linus Roach and Anson Mount. Therefore, the 'I've seen it all' moviegoer can't possibly guess by face recognition alone.This is one of the things that &#8220;Non-Stop&#8221; does incredibly right. Although the novelty of the movie may just be its selling point and downfall as well. Soon after takeoff, the tension begins and everything from beginning to end happens inside the plane. The action is swift, the tension is relentless, the intrigue is well done and as I stated before, guessing who's behind the shenanigans is more difficult than most movies. All that being said, being confined to a plane and with so much going on, some of the incidents border on the implausible or even worse the ridiculous or coincidental.&#8220;Non-Stop&#8221; does manage to at least splinter the mediocrity threshold but not by much.

Liam Neeson plays a very intense and demanding role in this, doing as good a job as Tom Hanks did in Captain Phillips last year.

If you like exciting and intense mysteries, you'll like it.

1690404,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00HLTD3ZW,C. Sawin,"[14, 23]","Saying Bill Marks is a grizzled man is a bit of an understatement. The blurry opening of &#34;Non-Stop&#34; reveals a scraggly Liam Neeson with sloppy hair and a scruffy beard. Bill looks like he's pulled six all-nighters in a row as he takes another swig of liquid courage from a coffee mug in his attempt to drown out the world around him. You also notice him admiring couples and seemingly hating technology; cell phones in particular. He glares at cell phones with such discontent that you can't help but think that about the character. After retrieving the bear of a little girl flying solo for the first time and revealing his fear of flying to the peculiar woman sitting next to him named Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), Bill makes his way to the restroom, slaps duct tape over the smoke detector, lays his weapon and everything in his pockets neatly on the table, and calms his nerves with some nicotine. It's at this point where it's revealed Bill is actually an air marshal. You have to plow through the film to hear the rest of Bill's story, but in actuality it's all a gigantic waste of time.Things don't really get too ridiculous until Austin Reilly (Corey Stoll), a passenger who is also an NYPD officer, opens his mouth. Not only is he the epitome of New York stereotypes, but he also shares the key scene in which the action thriller takes a turn for the worst. Reilly says something along the lines of, &#34;What are you gonna do?&#34; Bill, with his gun crammed in Reilly's neck, replies, &#34;From one cop to another, you know.&#34; What's disappointing is that even the action scenes aren't impressive. There's a fist fight in the bathroom that is the closest thing to anything remotely rewarding in the film, but you honestly just find yourself trying to choke back jokes regarding Liam Neeson joining the mile high club. On a slight upside, the way the film utilizes a broken phone into the texts that are shown on-screen is slightly amusing.The rest of the time is just devoted to Liam Neeson defying logic and saving the day solely because he's Liam Neeson. He leaves a trail of dead bodies on an airplane and none of the other passengers ever find any of the victims or stumble onto them. A good portion of the passengers left alive are beaten to a pulp thanks to Bill as he slams them around the plane and resorts to beating a teacher and a lawyer before suspecting the few people left who still trust him. He shoves Tom Bowen (Scott McNairy) around the plane with his arm pinned to his back and seems to use the poor guy as a ventriloquist dummy. The climax takes ludricousness to an entirely new level. It culminates with Neeson firing his weapon and hitting its mark in zero gravity in slow-motion with a plane missing half of its exterior as it dives to 8,000 feet.&#34;Non-Stop&#34; is unbelievably bad, which is really unfortunate since Liam Neeson is perfectly capable of delivering the goods. When crashing the plane is the only answer to a hijacked plane, when piling all of your luggage onto a bomb is the only solution, and when a heart condition is used to explain why someone likes the window seat, then &#34;Non-Stop&#34; is the answer. Now if the theme song to &#34;Team America: World Police&#34; had just played over the end credits, then this might have been somewhat worthwhile. What you're left with is a film that is reminiscent of &#34;Transporter 2,&#34; which is an action film everyone is very satisfied forgetting it actually exists.",2,'Non-Stop' review: Freedom costs a briefcase full of cocaine,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,3483,"['Saying', 'Bill', 'Marks', 'grizzled', 'man', 'bit', 'understatement', 'blurry', 'opening', '34', 'Non-Stop', '34', 'reveals', 'scraggly', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'sloppy', 'hair', 'scruffy', 'beard', 'Bill', 'pulled', 'six', 'all-nighters', 'row', 'swig', 'liquid', 'courage', 'coffee', 'mug', 'attempt', 'drown', 'out', 'world', 'also', 'notice', 'admiring', 'couples', 'seemingly', 'hating', 'technology', 'cell', 'phones', 'particular', 'cell', 'phones', 'such', 'discontent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'character', 'retrieving', 'bear', 'little', 'girl', 'flying', 'solo', 'first', 'time', 'revealing', 'fear', 'flying', 'peculiar', 'woman', 'sitting', 'next', 'named', 'Jen', 'Summers', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Bill', 'way', 'restroom', 'slaps', 'duct', 'tape', 'smoke', 'detector', 'weapon', 'everything', 'pockets', 'neatly', 'table', 'calms', 'nerves', 'nicotine', 'point', 'where', 'revealed', 'Bill', 'actually', 'air', 'marshal', 'have', 'plow', 'film', 'hear', 'rest', 'Bill', 'story', 'actuality', 'gigantic', 'waste', 'time.Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'Austin', 'Reilly', 'Corey', 'Stoll', 'passenger', 'who', 'also', 'NYPD', 'officer', 'mouth', 'Not', 'only', 'epitome', 'New', 'York', 'stereotypes', 'also', 'shares', 'key', 'scene', 'action', 'thriller', 'turn', 'worst', 'Reilly', 'something', 'lines', '34', 'What', 'are', 'gon', 'do', '34', 'Bill', 'gun', 'crammed', 'Reilly', 'neck', 'replies', '34', 'one', 'cop', 'know.', '34', 'What', 'disappointing', 'even', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'fist', 'fight', 'bathroom', 'closest', 'thing', 'anything', 'remotely', 'rewarding', 'film', 'honestly', 'just', 'find', 'trying', 'choke', 'back', 'jokes', 'regarding', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'joining', 'mile', 'high', 'club', 'slight', 'upside', 'way', 'film', 'broken', 'phone', 'texts', 'are', 'shown', 'on-screen', 'slightly', 'amusing.The', 'rest', 'time', 'just', 'devoted', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'defying', 'logic', 'saving', 'day', 'solely', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'trail', 'dead', 'bodies', 'airplane', 'none', 'other', 'passengers', 'ever', 'find', 'victims', 'stumble', 'good', 'portion', 'passengers', 'left', 'alive', 'are', 'beaten', 'pulp', 'thanks', 'Bill', 'plane', 'resorts', 'beating', 'teacher', 'lawyer', 'suspecting', 'few', 'people', 'left', 'who', 'still', 'trust', 'Tom', 'Bowen', 'Scott', 'McNairy', 'plane', 'arm', 'pinned', 'back', 'use', 'poor', 'guy', 'ventriloquist', 'dummy', 'climax', 'ludricousness', 'entirely', 'new', 'level', 'Neeson', 'firing', 'weapon', 'hitting', 'mark', 'zero', 'gravity', 'slow-motion', 'plane', 'missing', 'half', 'exterior', '8,000', 'feet.', '34', 'Non-Stop', '34', 'unbelievably', 'bad', 'really', 'unfortunate', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'delivering', 'goods', 'When', 'crashing', 'plane', 'only', 'answer', 'hijacked', 'plane', 'when', 'piling', 'luggage', 'bomb', 'only', 'solution', 'when', 'heart', 'condition', 'used', 'explain', 'why', 'someone', 'window', 'seat', 'then', '34', 'Non-Stop', '34', 'answer', 'Now', 'theme', 'song', '34', 'Team', 'America', 'World', 'Police', '34', 'had', 'just', 'played', 'over', 'end', 'credits', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'worthwhile', 'What', ""'re"", 'left', 'film', 'reminiscent', '34', 'Transporter', '2', '34', 'action', 'film', 'everyone', 'very', 'satisfied', 'forgetting', 'actually']",N/A

1690411,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00HLTD3ZW,Darren,"[0, 0]","Liam Neeson and his ""particular set of skills"" are back, this time as a burnt-out alcoholic Federal Air Marshall.  He's the sort of guy who orders gin & tonics and instead gets bottles of water from concerned flight attendants.  He smokes in the airplane's toilet, masking the alarm with duct tape.  He's afraid of flying.  I liked him.Indeed, it's hard to dislike Neeson Action Pictures: they do tend to be more intelligent than the product featuring the usual A-list action meatheads.  The first half of this picture is really quite good: quiet suspense which generates at least a feeling of realism, and some realistic flavor of airplane life as that applies to passengers negotiating with each other for favored seats and other mild irritations.  The plane itself, though, seems too wide, though I've not been on some of the latest Airbus monstrosities lately, so perhaps it's realistic.  (Business Class on this plane looks awesome -- great seats.)  And Neeson himself brings, as always, gravitas that other action pictures lack.  (Someone like Stallone, for instance, brings only titters.)  Neeson tends to play real men in his movies that we can believe in.  While occasionally vulnerable, he's also smart and doesn't rely merely on combat skills to apprehend the villain.  All of that applies here, as he tries to track down the terrorist on board amidst 150 passengers.But action pictures in general just can't maintain verisimilitude for very long.  This movie starts going off the rails when video from a phone onboard during all the excitement are uploaded to media outlets who immediately air the footage and build a narrative around ""disturbed"" and ""rogue"" Air Marshall Neeson.  Apparently, lawyers have vanished off the face of the earth 40,000 feet below.  And it gets worse from there, but I won't spoil things.  Let's just say that the motivations of the villain, when finally revealed, are really silly and just simply insufficient.  Some here have voiced complaints about the movie's supposed politics.  I doubt it has any, if only because both Left and Right can find something that they don't like here.3 out of 5.  Should've been better.

1690413,A2KY06QJWKZMBH,B00HLTD3ZW,David Durham Richardson II,"[3, 5]","This movie would make a great spoof movie in the vein of AIRPLANE!Let's see, okay, opening scene..... unhappy alcoholic who doesn't like Johnny Red Label Scotch, he grimaces as he drinks a 1/2 of a pint bottle. He miserably lights his cigarette, looking at the cig with disgust. The problem is that the director did not make Neesam inhale, he just puffs, miserably take another swig, looks in the rear view mirror, the vanity mirror on driver's side then, on the passenger side, and back to the rear view. Huffing puffing, choking on straight booze, can't inhale, throat clearing cough....ew, ew. This one real easy into swirl to a comedic version of self-disgusting loathe,Somehow, he's supposed to be off, or just got off and is still in the parking lot. Boss calls, knowing that he's an alcoholic begrudgingly tells him he's gotta take a flight across the Atlantic, ? because a Fed Marshall didn 't show up for work ? sick taking sick leave. Neesom vehemently disgusted, drown the boss's requests, by jumping out of car to drown him out with the roar of jet engines passing by. It's a passive-aggressive move, by government employee who drinks at work to a disgusted boss. Later, on the flight he warms/flirts up to the heroine of the movie an gives a drink order for the 2, her favorite, but the wise stewardess friend knows better returns with a bottle of water from him and the mixed drink for her.He hates his job, as he hates flying, which you see him hold on to his seat as though he going through a take-off in a meteor shower. Duh? No wonder Air Marsh hates his job. A cute, mid 40's J. Moore, weirdly bounces into the scene, wears a deep v cut blouse, not to show boobs, but to make you see a 3 - 4 inch wide scar that starts at the bottom of neck goes all the way down to the bottom of the V. Yes, and later with drama, she says &#34;I was dead 43 minutes, awakened and was told that they couldn't fix my heart and I could die at any moment!&#34;. So, she lives for the moment taking various flights all over the world, but refuses to answer Neesam's ?, what do you do for work?  HERE, SNL-style the story relates that she could be a potential drinking buddy as she likes to drink like a fish, hops international flights, has to sit at the window because &#34;don't want to miss anything? with the view. All passengers have to stay in their seat, but she doesn't, as she flits merrily around the scenes drink-n-hand, with the twist of nosy? vs villainous? vs. having fun as high on booze and being mischievous like a little cutey. She is portrayed to be alcoholic's  only friend, has detective/computer-like skills, BUT she could be one of the villains. Yes, the screenplay is this ridiculous, in its attempts to develop indirectly humorous twists.Before he goes to ticket counter, he runs into some in-the-hood white dude in jeans, ankle high basketball shoes of the 50's taking on the appearance of a liberal college professor with fabulous looking retro-eyewear, designer styled for a night at the Oscar.I have to admit it makes him looks like a psychopathic genius of Harvard U, with a hair-trigger stare. This villainous creep asks air marsh., &#34;where you going?&#34;. Air marsh ignores, he &#34;anyway says&#34; as airport strangers do, says &#34;I'm going to Amsterdam&#34; like he's going to Amsterdam's red district to a smoky weed shop, look at their legal pedophilic porno, and window-shop for a few ho's. We get the feeling psycho wants us to envy him. Now, you know instinctively know that this guy is the villain, but do give the screenwriters credit here as there was ingenuity demonstrated with who-dun-it misdirection as later in the midst of frenzyied struggling fight of air marshall vs. passengers, pilot, co-pilot, NYPD, white senior couple, the latter of whom, fiesty-ol-white-lady with permanent says &#34;no, I don't have Alzheimer's&#34; when interviewed for clues. The fight comes to a screeching halt, when our top of the list suspect points his gun, but, then, wisely hands the gun back to the air marshall in the proper manner. Wo=ow-ow!Then, screenwriters' guild comes in with political incorrectness- to make a turban-headed Muslim PHD into a neurosurgeon of molecular scientist into a sub-hero. Yes, this confuses the air marshall as well as a bankruptcy lawyer who seriously says &#34;you didn't find anything&#34; after the air marshall checks the Muslim doctor;s weirdly-worn leather brief bag, with a huge Muslim-Star of David-looking blue presidential-like seal on its exterior surface. Well, you know what happens when you publicly make racial profiling questions in flight, YOU DIE as a possible suspect and that what is supposeed to happen to greedy, smug lawyers.Of course, the honorable doctor is racially profiled by all English-speaking nearly all-white Americans passengers, the writers are trying to be sweet to him for his family suffered as Muslims post 9/11. He is warm and generous with his talents  as he fixes a broken nose for a NYPD officer, whose reasons for flying to London of course, takes a hit at the LGBT crowd, as his brother is going to get ceremoniously married. this nuvo-state-of-the-art wedding is going to be attended by a lily white macho-skint-head NYPD (he's no 9/11 hero, right?, still confused). They help you like him because he is willing to see his brother get married, gay style.Post veterans of the mideast wars times 2 are our villains, one of which is a black war bro, special op's-like computer specialist to the chief white war bro. The superbly dressed software looking wizard has one to many million $ figures running through his $150 million dollar demand. Both ask themselves the question publicly in the plane &#34;I don't why I went to war to risk my life&#34;, &#34;for what&#34;, &#34;I'm bitter, and mad as hell and I am not going to take anymore, no more Bush's and his daddy/Cheney's industial-military-petroleum complex. Chief whitey has PTSD of &#34;American-war-vet-in-a-war-but shouldn't-be-fighting&#34; in places where genocide is monstrously severe PTSD complex that he becomes a nemesis with his terrorist like feature of kill a passenger every 20 minutes. It's blind terrorist-minded revenge of those Air Marshalls who let 9/11, but this is a misdirect.But seriously, this could make a scream of a parody spoof!It gets a ONE STAR for some subtle political incorrected-ness humor!

Barker,"[2, 3]","First I want to say it's a good story and the acting is good as well.I'm writing this review as a counter to those who are blasting this solely because it makes certain elements of America look bad.Well, after doing 20 years (1980-2000) in the Navy I discovered that people who you think can't possibly be good can end up being a very compassionate person towards humanity, and those who are supposed to be heroes can do very bad things.  Yes, really.  During my time in the military, I'm going to say about the worst event that came to light was Iran-Contra.  For the commenters here who have said this movie kicks sand in the face of blah blah blah, well, you should read about Iran-Contra.  And this is only one event.  There are plenty of others that never get discovered. To me it's bad enough that a U.S. Military officer can be involved in something so against morality, ethics and law; but far worse that even after being involved, the state where he resides almost elected him as Senator?  Maybe it's those people who are giving this movie such a poor rating since it's pure hypocrisy.I constantly hear in the news, either local or national, how someone involved in the military or police has done something wrong, and some of the events are pretty bad.

He's spent the last few years of his career fighting, jumping, shooting, and rescuing his way on to movie screens worldwide at a time when most stars would be settling in to nice quiet roles as an elderly statesman or wise old man. &#34;Non-Stop&#34; sees Neeson fully embracing his hero side once again in a thriller that is equally parts mystery and thriller as it is disaster and adventure film.Bill Marks is a weary air marshal on another non-stop flight from the U.S. to Europe. His worst fears are realized when he receives text messages from an unknown person on the flight claiming they will kill one passenger every twenty minutes until their ransom demands are met. Now he must figure out who he can trust to help identify the sadistic individual before they strike.&#34;Non-Stop&#34; teams up Liam Neeson with &#34;Taken&#34; Director Jaume Collet-Serra for another thrilling go-round at saving the day. Collet-Sera likes to helm movies that deal with controversial subject matter. It's obvious he wants people to walk away from his films not only entertained but with something to think and talk about.&#34;Non-Stop&#34; is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence, some language, sensuality and drug references. I can't think of a single moment of sensuality or drug references. Neeson enjoys his alcohol and smoking but I'd be hard-pressed to consider that &#34;drug references.&#34;I would be lying if I didn't tell you that &#34;Non-Stop&#34; does feel like an extension of &#34;Taken.&#34; Liam Neeson's character might be a bit more hard-boiled, but he's in essence cut from the same pattern.

1690451,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00HLTD3ZW,FNDNreview,"[14, 19]","Let me begin by saying that Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors &#8211; and as far as I&#8217;m concerned everything he touches turns to pure gold.  He became a full-blown household name after his very skilful work in Schindler&#8217;s List, but in my book, he will forever be etched in my imagination as Qui-Gon Jinn from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; he&#8217;s been apart of some historically terrible movies, including The Phantom Menace, along with films like Battleship, The Haunting, and The Nut Job.  Still, Neeson&#8217;s best work outweighs the duds.  And, even though his role in Non-Stop is far from memorable, he rarely ever fails to entertain.Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Unknown, House of Wax), Non-Stop stars Liam Neeson as Bill Marks &#8211; a U.S. federal air marshal secretly patrolling a commercial airliner from New York to London.  Early into the flight, Marks is sent a text message over a secure channel from someone anonymously demanding $150 million &#8211; or someone aboard the plane will die every 20 minutes.Originally believing it to be a prank from fellow federal air marshal, Jack Hammond (Anson Mount), it quickly becomes clear that the anonymous terrorist is not messing around when passengers are abruptly murdered.  Matters turn even more bothersome when the mystery man behind the plot starts framing Marks &#8211; making it look like he&#8217;s the one doing the hijacking.With only a handful of people to aid him, including a fellow passenger, Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) and a flight attendant, Nancy Hoffman (Michelle Dockery), Marks attempts to discover who is behind this elaborate plot &#8211; while also attempting to stop passengers from turning up dead.  On this plane, though, everyone is a suspect, but when the occupants of the plane all end up having clean records, it makes it that much more for difficult to stop everyone from assuming that he&#8217;s the real villain.Not unlike his portrayals in films like Taken or The Grey (where he is also no stranger to a plane), Liam Neeson portrays a cool and calm customer, proving again and again that he is a solid action hero and a complete bad-ass.  More often than not, airplane films all look alike, but casting Neeson is a smart way to add spice to a role that only a handful of Hollywood actors have the power to contribute in such a confined film of this nature.  He&#8217;s edgy, methodical, and disciplined beyond belief &#8211; and this film is successful because he&#8217;s in it.  Sure, there are problems with the plot, but nothing that&#8217;s going to overly ruin the viewing experience.In typical flawed hero fashion, the story begins depicting our protagonist as loving father &#8211; yet possible alcoholic.  It&#8217;s never a good sign when an officer of the law goes to work after a big swig of hard liquor.  Never the less, Neeson&#8217;s character is obviously trying to drawn his demons or sorrows &#8211; possibly even both.  However, even despite the early cocktail, Bill Marks goes through the process of mentally documenting his surroundings, identifying passengers, and successfully helping a frightened little girl board a plan.  Within the first 15 minutes of this film, you can tell that regardless of this man&#8217;s shortcomings, he can be the difference between passengers living and dying.While there is very little wrong with the protagonist, the antagonist is a mystery until the climax, much like a Scream horror flick or even another airplane mystery, Executive Decision.  Unlike the Scream films, there is no malicious sounding voice on the other end of the phone.  Instead, viewers must settle for a text-happy passenger that would rather send in his demands rather than verbally jousting with the good guy.  Understandably, it would be much easier to spot a guy talking on a plane than to pick out one of the many texters &#8211; yet it severely limits the emotional response when the villain is revealed.  On top of that, the motive behind the ransom is rather unimaginative.  At least in the Scream flicks, the killers always had a personal motive, which is not really the main case here.The film is cut together quite nice by Jaume Collet-Serra.  He spends a great deal of time focusing on multiple individuals to keep the audience guessing about who is behind the on-flight killings.  Just when you think he&#8217;s about to be revealed, a minor swerve comes into play and starts the focus on another supporting character.  Speaking of supporting characters, Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery receive the bulk of the minor character most screen time, although neither really stands out in an acting capacity.  Both are brilliant actors, but this is not the type of film that highlights acting ability.Overall, Non-Stop is not unlike its title in the sense that the film is rarely ever slow-paced or uninteresting.  To that end, you could easily say the film features non-stop action, even though the action doesn&#8217;t always come in the form of the usual &#8220;shoot first, ask questions later&#8221; mentality.  Some scenes are more thrilling than others, basically depending on how much you care about certain characters when the time comes from them to bite the bullet.  Regardless, there isn&#8217;t a bad thing to say about Liam Neeson&#8217;s portrayal and when this film hits home video &#8211; there will definitely be an open spot waiting on my shelf.  Die-hard fans of Liam Neeson, and even causal action flick lovers, shouldn&#8217;t hesitate to devote their undivided attention to Non-Stop.GRADE:  B-FNDNreview.com",4,Liam Neeson takes on texting

Richardson, Chris Roach and Ryan Engle and makes the audience cringe at the concept of long airplane flights. The pace of the story is harrowing and even if at the ending we are left with the feeling `I should have figured this out', the action and the acting is first rate and the film proves to be a fine summer evening diversion.Bill Marks (Liam Neeson), a former cop now an Air Marshall dealing with his daughter's death by drinking, even as he prepares to board a flight that needs his expertise as a law enforcer. Suspicious things begin to happen when there is an argument over a window seat Zack (Nate Parker) and the inquisitive Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), an encounter with a frightened child (Quinn McColgan), a co-dependent relationship between Marks and a stewardess (Michelle Dockery), etc. While on the flight from New York to London, Marks gets a text telling him that unless 150 million dollars is transferred to an offshore account, someone will die every 20 minutes. Everyone becomes a suspect, Marks is called a terrorist, people begin dying in a string of strange occurrences, and ultimately, with craft and cunning and employing the aid of the passengers, Marks finds the truth in the situation.Supporting actors who offer fine support include Scoot McNairy, Linus Roache, Anson Mount, Corey Stoll, Omar Metwally among others.

That's about it for character development as we get into a text-message driven whodunnit aboard a passenger jet where terrorists will kill a passenger every 20 minutes until they get some money. A handful of potential suspects emerge as Liam handles not drinking, an uncooperative ground supervisor, an uncooperative Captain and generally understanding passengers who start dropping like flies.The bad guys have conceived an unlikely plan to blow up the jet backed a fairly spurious motive and a near-telepathic way to predict what everyone would do each step of the way. There are about a dozen or so easier ways to achieve the same objective but for the sake of a plot it involves phone viruses, texting, knowing the air marshals on board, a suitcase of drugs and the hopes that Liam kills enough people to keep the body count in line with the threat. It's frankly only steps away from the comedy-feast of Ray Liotta's Turbulence movie but our lead man keeps a straight face throughout.One of Non-Stop's biggest issues is that the whole thing happens on a plane which leaves very little room for decent action scenes - we see fights in the toilet, fights in the galleys and mini scuffles leading to a fairly dull climax. After an admittedly fun first act, it struggles to fill the screen time, and in between some poor CG and TV-quality dialog, it's clear this is a made-for-TV movie on a low budget masquerading as a big picture.

(He has become America's most unlikely action hero. Stallone and Schwarzenegger should take notes: NO plastic surgery and no phony white teeth!)If you answered &#34;Yes&#34; to any or all of the above, have I got a film for YOU!This time Neeson is a U.S. Air Marshall who, after an airliner is over the Atlantic, receives a text message on a secured network advising him that one passenger will die every 20 minutes until $150M is transferred to an off-shore account. And that is just the beginning of this twisty white-knuckle ride!We watch:* Liam Neeson (&#34;Taken 1 & 2&#34;) is our hero, a bit the worse for the wear, but a smart, resourceful agent, who can only watch as he is brilliantly framed. We in the audience were as frustrated as he!* Julianne Moore (&#34;Don Jon&#34;) is the agitated gal who negotiates for the seat next to our hero.* Michelle Dockery (&#34;Downton Abbey&#34;) is the chief flight attendant: wary, watchful and determined to protect her passengers.There are so many suspects, we were as muddled and terrified as our hero, but I have never before been in an audience where a MAN screamed. I was glad he did so I didn't have to!This amazing PG-13 script was written by John W. Richardson and Christopher Roach; it has very little profanity, an intense plot plus some fisticuffs and gunfire. Director Jaume Collet-Serra (&#34;Taken&#34;) held our attention from the first frame. Most of the story takes place on the airliner, so he had to be creative to keep us focused.As someone who only has flown small aircraft, I am no more than a lay person, so if there are plot holes in this cleverly crafted script, I didn't spot them.

He brought victory and truimph to Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia movies. And his role in Ra's Al Ghul in Batman Begins was very exceptional. And over the past 4 years movies like Taken, Unknown, The Grey, etc. have made him a noteworthy action star, which is why today I choose to review the movie: Non Stop.In Non Stop we meet a man by the name of William Marks. Early on it is evident that he is a bit of an alcoholic and smoker and is not exactly the social one. After boarding a flight scheduled to go to London, He is revealed to be a federal air marshal. Upon looking at his phone, William begins to receive texts instructing him to forward $150 million(small amount isn't it?) to a specific bank account or every 20 minutes a passenger will die. And so we have our thriller.Liam Neeson again rocked the film (in a good way) with his fine performance, as did his co star Julianne Moore. I really enjoyed the 2nd act of the film; while also enjoying the way the story began to unfold.So to close, Non Stop is another film that has intensity, suspense, and good acting which is why i rate the movie itself:3.5 StarsRated PG-13Starring: Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Lupita Nyong'o, Michelle Dockery, Linus Roache, Nate Parker",4,"You think you know, but you have no idea....",1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,1324,"['Liam', 'Neeson', 'good', 'actor', 'perhaps', 'even', 'great', 'definitely', 'can', 'remember', 'Schindler', 'List', 'brought', 'victory', 'truimph', 'Aslan', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'movies', 'role', 'Ra', 'Al', 'Ghul', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'was', 'very', 'exceptional', 'past', '4', 'years', 'movies', 'Taken', 'Unknown', 'Grey', 'etc', 'have', 'made', 'noteworthy', 'action', 'star', 'why', 'today', 'choose', 'review', 'movie', 'Non', 'Stop.In', 'Non', 'Stop', 'meet', 'man', 'name', 'William', 'Marks', 'Early', 'evident', 'bit', 'alcoholic', 'smoker', 'not', 'exactly', 'social', 'one', 'boarding', 'flight', 'scheduled', 'go', 'London', 'revealed', 'be', 'federal', 'air', 'marshal', 'looking', 'phone', 'William', 'receive', 'texts', 'instructing', 'forward', '150', 'million', 'small', 'amount', ""n't"", 'specific', 'bank', 'account', '20', 'minutes', 'passenger', 'will', 'die', 'so', 'have', 'thriller.Liam', 'Neeson', 'again', 'rocked', 'film', 'good', 'way', 'fine', 'performance', 'did', 'co', 'star', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'really', 'enjoyed', '2nd', 'act', 'film', 'also', 'enjoying', 'way', 'story', 'began', 'unfold.So', 'close', 'Non', 'Stop', 'film', 'intensity', 'suspense', 'good', 'acting', 'why', 'i', 'rate', 'movie', 'itself:3.5', 'StarsRated', 'PG-13Starring', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Lupita', 'Nyong', 'o', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'Nate', 'Parker']",N/A

Also, as is the case often in these type movies, are a series of improbable events that move the story along, such as the live news being shown on the plane, that made me say &#34;seriously&#34; and smack my forehead and events that never got quite explained in a way that made sense anyways.The movie does keep the suspense and action going for it, as it does do a good job at that even though there are numerous plot holes and improbable events that lead to the culmination of the bad guy(s) with their plan to escape, which I wont give away here but was another one of those &#34;seriously&#34; smacking the forehead moments. Along with very predictable ending that followed the formulaic conclusion and hero saves the day theme.As a pure action movie, this is ok enough popcorn fare but with its formulaic plot, improbable events that move the story along and predictable ending makes this movie less than what it could be.

1690515,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B00HLTD3ZW,Kane's Review,"[5, 7]","Liam Neeson once again delivers in another off the charts thriller! This time, he's kicking ass 30,000 feet in the air!The plot revolves around Neeson as US Federal Marshal, Bill Marks who boards British Aqualantic Flight 10 on a non-stop flight from New York to London. Minutes into the flight taking off, an unknown hacker hacks into Marks' phone who threatens that to kill someone on the plane every 20 minutes unless he transfers $150 million to a specific bank account. Marks consults with the other Air Marshal on the flight, Jack Hammond. After discovering that Jack has been smuggling cocaine, they get into a fight in the plane's bathroom where Marks kills Jack, resulting in the first death.From there on out, Bill Marks must track down the killer of well over 150 people on board before anyone else is killed. But who's the killer is the question? Is it his flight passenger partner, Jen Summers? Is it the beautiful flight attendant, Nancy Hoffman? Or is it someone else on the flight? I'll tell you, when I watched this movie in theaters, I thought it was probably anyone. Nearing the middle of the movie I was on the edge of my seat, while my suspicions were constantly changing, my heart rate increased, goosebumps on my arms multiplied, and my sweat glands turned on. It's definitely an extreme thriller that will mess with your mind and body sensors until the very end. The movie takes a big twist when Bill Marks cracks the case and I'll leave it at that.Overall, this was yet another great Liam Neeson film (as if any Liam Neeson films are bad) that knew how to get the viewer worked up. I'm almost surprised that Neeson has yet to win an Oscar for any of his performances. Anyways, I definitely recommend this movie if you're a fan of plane thrillers or Liam Neeson. I'd even recommend having this movie as a Family Movie Night or invite some friends over to watch, as I'm sure they'll enjoy this on the edge of your seat thriller",5,"A Goosebump Producing, Edge of Your Seat Thriller That Will Definitely Get Your Nerves Working",1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,1950,"['Liam', 'Neeson', 'once', 'again', 'delivers', 'charts', 'thriller', 'time', 'kicking', 'ass', '30,000', 'feet', 'air', 'plot', 'around', 'Neeson', 'US', 'Federal', 'Marshal', 'Bill', 'Marks', 'who', 'boards', 'British', 'Aqualantic', 'Flight', '10', 'non-stop', 'flight', 'New', 'York', 'London', 'Minutes', 'flight', 'taking', 'off', 'unknown', 'hacker', 'hacks', 'Marks', 'phone', 'who', 'kill', 'someone', 'plane', '20', 'minutes', '150', 'million', 'specific', 'bank', 'account', 'Marks', 'consults', 'other', 'Air', 'Marshal', 'flight', 'Jack', 'Hammond', 'discovering', 'Jack', 'been', 'smuggling', 'cocaine', 'get', 'fight', 'plane', 'bathroom', 'where', 'Marks', 'Jack', 'resulting', 'first', 'death.From', 'there', 'out', 'Bill', 'Marks', 'must', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'well', '150', 'people', 'board', 'anyone', 'else', 'killed', 'who', 'killer', 'question', 'flight', 'passenger', 'partner', 'Jen', 'Summers', 'beautiful', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Nancy', 'Hoffman', 'someone', 'else', 'flight', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'theaters', 'thought', 'was', 'probably', 'anyone', 'Nearing', 'middle', 'movie', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspicions', 'were', 'constantly', 'changing', 'heart', 'rate', 'increased', 'goosebumps', 'arms', 'multiplied', 'sweat', 'glands', 'turned', 'definitely', 'extreme', 'thriller', 'will', 'mess', 'mind', 'body', 'sensors', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'big', 'twist', 'when', 'Bill', 'Marks', 'case', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'that.Overall', 'was', 'yet', 'great', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'film', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'films', 'are', 'bad', 'knew', 'how', 'get', 'viewer', 'worked', 'up', ""'m"", 'almost', 'surprised', 'Neeson', 'yet', 'win', 'Oscar', 'performances', 'Anyways', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', ""'re"", 'fan', 'plane', 'thrillers', 'Liam', 'Neeson', ""'d"", 'even', 'recommend', 'having', 'movie', 'Family', 'Movie', 'Night', 'invite', 'friends', 'watch', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'edge', 'seat', 'thriller']",N/A

Power ""nlp trainer""","[6, 7]","Sometimes a movie comes along whose theme is topical and coincidental, and if the topic the movie coincides with is negative or of great public concern, the movie may be withheld, indefinitely withdrawn or postponed.Thus Joel Schumacher's movie Phone Booth about a sniper who terrorises a phone booth was withdrawn for a while because it coincided with the reign of terror of the Washington sniper. Premieres of Reacher starring Tom Cruise were reportedly cancelled, and some of the opening scenes reportedly edited in light of the Sandy Hook massacre, yet it was released about a month later as the rhetoric about gun control and school massacres escalated in Washington and elsewhere.The NRA's famous slogan: &#34;The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.&#34;Non Stop eerily coincides with the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH 370. In the absence of facts surrounding the flight's disappearance, theories abounded, two passengers with stolen passports possibly terrorists, a deliberately disconnected communications system, the flight continuing for hours in a different direction from its last known flight path and location, speculation about the pilot's mental health, the flight spirited to an unknown destination by terrorists.As the world watched and waited, this movie came along, and as I watched it I realized how little the people on the ground know about what is really happening in the air, how they developed theories which seemed plausible to the people on the ground and to the waiting public, yet to us as the viewing audience it is entirely different.The premise of this movie is that an air Marshal played by Liam Neeson, the only person on the plane allowed to carry a gun suddenly goes rogue. Paradoxically, although our Air Marshal flies everywhere all the time, yet he is afraid of flying, and after this flight he has good reason to be. Although we don't know the Air Marshal or his character, somehow, perhaps because he is Liam Neeson we implicitly trust him, and the image conveyed to air traffic control is that he is seeking a ransom for the safe delivery of the plane, yet we see an entirely different scenario unfold on the plane, as our hero or villain, takes on an unknown adversary.Like an Agatha Christie mystery there are a series of false trails and red herrings, as the Air Marshal endeavours to solve the mystery of who is using his identity to get clean away with a ransom. Is the person even on the plane, one wonders?For instance a woman played by Julianne Moore somehow manages to swap seats to get the seat next to the Air Marshal just before takeoff. HIs own behavior seems erratic to other passengers as he violates their privacy, and provokes their ire. Even the pilots have to make decisions about who to trust. Should they trust the Air Marshal they know well, or someone on the other end of the radio. One choice could end their lives. The other could end their careers.This movie truly provokes great storytelling dilemmas.Non Stop did continually surprise me and the story did develop in surprising ways. One thing that particularly surprised me was the 'bomb protocol.' I quite enjoyed this movie, and Liam Neeson I thought did an excellent job in the leading role.If you like Neeson and you like action, you will most likely enjoy this movie.

1690546,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00HLTD3ZW,MadMacs,"[3, 5]","It seems to me that Liam Neeson has supplanted Bruce Willis as the elder action star. Not that Bruce hasn't done his part; 'Red' was hilarious and really enjoyable. But as evidenced by the last installment of the Die Hard franchise and a stunning host of B-movie cameos, he appears to be running on fumes at this point.Neeson deservedly gets the plumb roles nowadays. Material that was once the dominion of Harrison Ford - now finds its way to the Irishman's desk. And it pays off in spades as Liam is both enthralling and totally engaging as a variety of retired field agents and former cops.And so with this film's premise as former police officer, now US Federal Air Marshal, William ""Bill"" Marks.His long career is coming to a close - but not by choice. Alcohol abuse, a poor attitude, and questionable judgments has pretty much sunk his final days with a badge. He's on his last flight; likely to be fired upon his arrival to NYC.But this trip will be like none other.Plans which have been prepared far in advance are about to be set into motion - and Agent Bill Marks is sitting dead center of the ""X"".Immediately after takeoff, Marks is instructed by way of instant message that either A) He facilitates the transfer of US$150 million dollars to a numbered account; or B) Every 20 minutes one person on the aircraft will die. No negotiation. And it's not an idle threat - people begin dying every twelve-hundred seconds.Scrambling for time and tactically off-balance, he desperately tries every trick he knows to expose the hidden maniac. But every step he takes is one that has been predicted and a counter-move specially prepared for him and him alone.Soon, it becomes clear that his image - everything that he is and was - is being made to fit a very special frame: Emotionally Unstable Hijacker.The stock movie really becomes an outstanding action flick when the news media jumps into the story - and they've played into the hands of the real hijacker with gullible ease. Officially, he's now a deranged alcoholic with a gun demanding money while threatening an airliner filled with passengers. A plot element that works absolutely perfectly in the film; adding the right edge to drive the story and characters along.With the influx of the media, the passengers turn against the agent, seeing him as the real criminal. And they're going to do whatever is necessary to stop *him*. Completely oblivious to the fact they too are playing an unwitting role in the elaborate scheme.Originally setting out to prevent the deaths of the people under his protection, it quickly twists into a desperate race to save his own name before the forces behind this insidious scam gets away with a fortune while he takes the long road to The Needle - or the short road to much worse.A hugely enjoyable tension-filled flick that delivers (no pun intended) non-stop action with Liam Neeson dodging a plethora of custom built traps.Strong four stars.",4,A Game Of Mouse Trap - With Real People,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,2940,"['Liam', 'Neeson', 'supplanted', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'elder', 'action', 'star', 'Not', 'Bruce', ""n't"", 'done', 'part', 'was', 'hilarious', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'evidenced', 'last', 'installment', 'Die', 'Hard', 'franchise', 'stunning', 'host', 'B-movie', 'cameos', 'be', 'running', 'fumes', 'point.Neeson', 'deservedly', 'plumb', 'nowadays', 'Material', 'was', 'once', 'dominion', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'now', 'way', 'Irishman', 'desk', 'spades', 'Liam', 'enthralling', 'totally', 'engaging', 'variety', 'retired', 'field', 'agents', 'former', 'cops.And', 'so', 'film', 'premise', 'former', 'police', 'officer', 'now', 'US', 'Federal', 'Air', 'Marshal', 'William', 'Bill', 'Marks.His', 'long', 'career', 'coming', 'close', 'not', 'choice', 'Alcohol', 'abuse', 'poor', 'attitude', 'questionable', 'judgments', 'pretty', 'much', 'sunk', 'final', 'days', 'badge', 'last', 'flight', 'likely', 'be', 'fired', 'arrival', 'NYC.But', 'trip', 'will', 'be', 'none', 'other.Plans', 'have', 'been', 'prepared', 'far', 'advance', 'are', 'be', 'set', 'motion', 'Agent', 'Bill', 'Marks', 'sitting', 'dead', 'center', 'X', '.Immediately', 'takeoff', 'Marks', 'instructed', 'way', 'instant', 'message', 'transfer', 'US', '150', 'million', 'dollars', 'numbered', 'account', 'B', 'Every', '20', 'minutes', 'one', 'person', 'aircraft', 'will', 'die', 'negotiation', 'not', 'idle', 'threat', 'people', 'begin', 'dying', 'twelve-hundred', 'seconds.Scrambling', 'time', 'tactically', 'off-balance', 'desperately', 'trick', 'expose', 'hidden', 'maniac', 'step', 'one', 'been', 'predicted', 'counter-move', 'specially', 'prepared', 'alone.Soon', 'clear', 'image', 'everything', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'fit', 'very', 'special', 'frame', 'Emotionally', 'Unstable', 'Hijacker.The', 'stock', 'movie', 'really', 'outstanding', 'action', 'flick', 'when', 'news', 'media', 'story', ""'ve"", 'played', 'hands', 'real', 'hijacker', 'gullible', 'ease', 'Officially', 'now', 'deranged', 'alcoholic', 'gun', 'demanding', 'money', 'threatening', 'airliner', 'filled', 'passengers', 'plot', 'element', 'absolutely', 'perfectly', 'film', 'adding', 'right', 'edge', 'drive', 'story', 'characters', 'along.With', 'influx', 'media', 'passengers', 'turn', 'agent', 'seeing', 'real', 'criminal', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'necessary', 'stop', '*him*', 'Completely', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'too', 'are', 'playing', 'unwitting', 'role', 'elaborate', 'scheme.Originally', 'setting', 'out', 'prevent', 'deaths', 'people', 'protection', 'quickly', 'desperate', 'race', 'save', 'own', 'name', 'forces', 'insidious', 'scam', 'away', 'fortune', 'long', 'road', 'Needle', 'short', 'road', 'much', 'worse.A', 'hugely', 'enjoyable', 'tension-filled', 'flick', 'delivers', 'pun', 'intended', 'non-stop', 'action', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'dodging', 'plethora', 'custom', 'built', 'four', 'stars']",N/A

He's back again, solidifying his emergence as one of Hollywood's better action heroes, this time taking the thrills up 20,000 feet into a non-stop transatlantic flight. Neeson plays Bill Marks, an air marshal who has struggled with alcohol and his job ever since his young daughter died. While in the air, he begins receiving threatening text messages from a stranger who claims he will kill one passenger every 20 minutes unless 150 million dollars is wired into a specific account.The film is suitably tense and claustrophobic, and Neeson does an excellent job as a man teetering just on the edge of holding everything together. As the stakes raise, and Marks starts to look more and more like the bad guy he's hunting, the film really begins to pay off. Much like our incredibly smart, anonymous killer, the script is perfectly paced and knows exactly what to do and when to do it to keep the suspense at a near boil without totally jumping the shark. All of the performances are solid and the story is clear without insulting the intelligence.There are more than a few cliches, however, that keep it from being more than just really entertaining. Also, while the film necessarily relies on text messaging to drive both the story and the mood, it does start to get a little old when you're spending what feels like five minutes just reading back and forth text messages. Also, there are a few equally necessary if not equally disappointing nods to 9/11 and prejudiced profiling, which makes a lot of sense when you've got a movie about a terrorist on a plane. Finally, there are a few minor plot holes that don't really rear their heads until you're headed home and reliving the story in your mind. But really, these are all tiny flaws in what is otherwise an excellent way to spend a tense 90 minutes of your life.

There may be spoilers.When I go spend money in February - and just before the Oscars - for an obvious action-thriller starring Liam Neeson, I have a pretty good idea of what I'm in for.  The 60 year old actor has made a new career for himself based on action heroes, and he's damn good at it.Here, Neeson plays Bill Marks, a hard drinking Sky Marshal who is on the verge of getting fired.  He shows up for this flight between New York and London, but there is a second marshal (Anson Mount) on the plane as well.  Midway over the ocean, Marks receives a text on his ""secure"" phone promising to kill someone on the plane every 20 minutes unless $150 million is wired into a bank account.Marks, like Denzel Washington's pilot in ""Flight"" must shake off his mild inebriation and get to work finding the terrorist.  During the first half of the movie, numerous suspects are tossed in front of us to contemplate, including a Muslim doctor (Omar Metwally), a New York cop (Corey Stoll) and Marks' seatmate (Julianne Moore) who negotiates strongly with another man (Nate Parker) to get the window seat next to Marks.Sure enough, the first person is killed but it would be a bit of a stretch to think the bad guy would have planned this out so perfectly.  When Marks alerts his supervisor (Shea Whigham), he's coming across a bit unhinged.  This conflict escalates when the routing number to the bank comes back under Marks' name.  The rest of the film plays out as expected, with some fierce fights on the plane showing Neeson's impressive physical acumen.Eventually as Marks and the crew attempt to avoid disaster, the terrorists are uncovered but the plot becomes ridiculous which ultimately leaves a bit of a bad taste in our mouths as the credits roll.  As an added attraction watch for ""Downton Abbey's"" Michelle Dockery and recent Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o (""12 Years a Slave"") as flight attendants.  Director Jaume Collet-Serra (""Unknown"") keeps things moving along and at times provides some seat gripping tension.  The fights are well done, the acting is good.  The plot could have used some help, but overall, a decent film.",3,3 1/2 stars for a fine thriller with a silly conclusion,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,2149,"['Theatrical', 'review', 'may', 'be', 'spoilers.When', 'go', 'spend', 'money', 'February', 'just', 'Oscars', 'obvious', 'action-thriller', 'starring', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', ""'m"", '60', 'year', 'old', 'actor', 'made', 'new', 'career', 'based', 'action', 'heroes', 'damn', 'good', 'it.Here', 'Neeson', 'Bill', 'Marks', 'hard', 'drinking', 'Sky', 'Marshal', 'who', 'verge', 'getting', 'fired', 'up', 'flight', 'New', 'York', 'London', 'second', 'marshal', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'plane', 'as', 'well', 'Midway', 'ocean', 'Marks', 'text', 'secure', 'phone', 'promising', 'kill', 'someone', 'plane', '20', 'minutes', '150', 'million', 'wired', 'bank', 'account.Marks', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'pilot', 'Flight', 'must', 'shake', 'off', 'mild', 'inebriation', 'get', 'work', 'finding', 'terrorist', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'numerous', 'suspects', 'are', 'tossed', 'front', 'contemplate', 'including', 'Muslim', 'doctor', 'Omar', 'Metwally', 'New', 'York', 'cop', 'Corey', 'Stoll', 'Marks', 'seatmate', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'who', 'strongly', 'man', 'Nate', 'Parker', 'get', 'window', 'seat', 'next', 'Marks.Sure', 'enough', 'first', 'person', 'killed', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'stretch', 'think', 'bad', 'guy', 'would', 'have', 'planned', 'out', 'so', 'perfectly', 'When', 'Marks', 'supervisor', 'Shea', 'Whigham', 'coming', 'bit', 'unhinged', 'conflict', 'when', 'routing', 'number', 'bank', 'back', 'Marks', 'name', 'rest', 'film', 'out', 'expected', 'fierce', 'fights', 'plane', 'showing', 'Neeson', 'impressive', 'physical', 'acumen.Eventually', 'Marks', 'crew', 'attempt', 'avoid', 'disaster', 'terrorists', 'are', 'uncovered', 'plot', 'ridiculous', 'ultimately', 'bit', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouths', 'credits', 'roll', 'added', 'attraction', 'watch', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'recent', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Lupita', 'Nyong', 'o', '12', 'Slave', 'flight', 'attendants', 'Director', 'Jaume', 'Collet-Serra', 'Unknown', 'things', 'moving', 'along', 'times', 'seat', 'gripping', 'tension', 'fights', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'good', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'help', 'overall', 'decent', 'film']",N/A

1690574,A5SIP1Z1ZKVD7,B00HLTD3ZW,MPreddy,"[0, 1]","As a connoisseur of airplane dramas I'd been looking forward to this movie for months; last night got all situated with a fire in the fireplace, a drink, a bowl of popcorn and .... zzzzzzzzzzz.  I actually started leafing through a magazine at one point.The premise is halfway decent but the execution -- snore!  It seemed interminable.  And the &#34;payoff&#34; at the end was short and blah.A few random thoughts:- For an airplane setting, they could've been in an insurance salesman's office most of the time, the lack of motion effects and sound effects was striking.  And there was only one decent air maneuver, minutes before the end of the flick.  Otherwise they all could've been sitting in the bleachers of a high-school gym for all it said &#34;airplane thriller.&#34;- Waste of Julianne Moore, whom I think is a really good actress.  She played a &#34;live to the fullest&#34; kook in the most lackluster way possible and  had some of the dumbest lines and direction.  Making goofy faces right in the middle of a life-or-death drama.  And Michelle Dockery of Downtown Abbey fame basically had two facial expressions the entire time and could've been portrayed by two different size zero dept store mannequins; another shame, I would've liked to see  her with a meatier role.-- Same for some other laugh lines inserted in what is supposed to be a heart-pounding thriller.  Eh?-- Smarmy writing. People kept asking each other &#34;Are you alright?&#34; in the most absurd settings. Yeah, I'm great, I love being injured at 38,000 feet over water with a serial killer on the loose, no sweat dude.&#34;  I mean, return to Dialogue 101.  And the addition of the little girl aboard alone for pathos was nearly as cloying as Liam Neeson's soul-baring monologue to the planeload of suspicious passengers.  I cringed with embarrassment for the writers and actors.-- No proper &#34;set up.&#34;  One of the conventions of the genre is a little character sketch of key passengers as they are getting ready to board, either via their interactions with loved ones, via phone calls, via their interaction with gate personnel (the obnoxious businessman, the honeymooners, etc. -- all cliche but it's useful and gets the viewer engaged.)  Here all we got was the cloying cute-kid set-up and a sort of slo-mo dream sequence-y few  minutes from Liam Neeson's POV.  Hard to care when it's all so vague and cryptic.-- Implausible character motivation.  Abounds. -- I can live with technical implausibility re the texting and so forth but one minute Neeson and others are suspecting everyone around them, the next they are high-fiving and bonding over the slightest provocation.  He decides a woman who made a scene to sit next to him is trustworthy right off the bat, for example.  Meanwhile I've seen school bus drivers exert more authority than the airline pilots did.- The best scene was toward the end when the airline pilot said &#34;F it!&#34; and did what he needed to do; like I said I was into a magazine by that  point.What a shame that a big budget, a couple of big stars and a reasonably good starting point had to end up this way.",2,Major disappointment,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,3134,"['connoisseur', 'airplane', 'dramas', ""'d"", 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'months', 'last', 'night', 'got', 'situated', 'fire', 'fireplace', 'drink', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'zzzzzzzzzzz', 'actually', 'started', 'leafing', 'magazine', 'one', 'point.The', 'premise', 'halfway', 'decent', 'execution', 'snore', 'seemed', 'interminable', '34', 'payoff', '34', 'end', 'was', 'short', 'blah.A', 'few', 'random', 'thoughts', 'airplane', 'setting', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'office', 'most', 'time', 'lack', 'motion', 'effects', 'sound', 'effects', 'was', 'striking', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'decent', 'air', 'maneuver', 'minutes', 'end', 'flick', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sitting', 'bleachers', 'high-school', 'gym', 'said', '34', 'airplane', 'thriller.', '34', 'Waste', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'whom', 'think', 'really', 'good', 'actress', 'played', '34', 'live', 'fullest', '34', 'kook', 'most', 'lackluster', 'way', 'possible', 'had', 'dumbest', 'lines', 'direction', 'Making', 'goofy', 'right', 'middle', 'life-or-death', 'drama', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'Downtown', 'Abbey', 'fame', 'basically', 'had', 'two', 'facial', 'expressions', 'entire', 'time', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'portrayed', 'two', 'different', 'size', 'zero', 'store', 'mannequins', 'shame', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'meatier', 'role.', 'Same', 'other', 'laugh', 'lines', 'inserted', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'heart-pounding', 'thriller', 'Eh', 'Smarmy', 'writing', 'People', 'kept', 'asking', 'other', '34', 'Are', 'alright', '34', 'most', 'absurd', 'settings', 'Yeah', ""'m"", 'great', 'love', 'being', 'injured', '38,000', 'feet', 'water', 'serial', 'killer', 'loose', 'sweat', 'dude.', '34', 'mean', 'return', 'Dialogue', '101', 'addition', 'little', 'girl', 'alone', 'pathos', 'was', 'nearly', 'as', 'cloying', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'soul-baring', 'monologue', 'planeload', 'suspicious', 'passengers', 'cringed', 'embarrassment', 'writers', 'actors.', 'No', 'proper', '34', 'set', 'up.', '34', 'One', 'conventions', 'genre', 'little', 'character', 'sketch', 'key', 'passengers', 'are', 'getting', 'ready', 'board', 'interactions', 'loved', 'ones', 'phone', 'calls', 'interaction', 'gate', 'personnel', 'obnoxious', 'businessman', 'honeymooners', 'etc', 'cliche', 'useful', 'viewer', 'engaged', 'Here', 'got', 'was', 'cloying', 'cute-kid', 'set-up', 'sort', 'slo-mo', 'dream', 'sequence-y', 'few', 'minutes', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'POV', 'Hard', 'care', 'when', 'so', 'vague', 'cryptic.', 'Implausible', 'character', 'motivation', 'Abounds', 'can', 'live', 'technical', 'implausibility', 're', 'texting', 'so', 'forth', 'one', 'minute', 'Neeson', 'others', 'are', 'suspecting', 'everyone', 'next', 'are', 'high-fiving', 'bonding', 'slightest', 'provocation', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'scene', 'sit', 'next', 'trustworthy', 'right', 'bat', 'example', 'Meanwhile', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'school', 'bus', 'drivers', 'exert', 'more', 'authority', 'airline', 'pilots', 'did.-', 'best', 'scene', 'was', 'end', 'when', 'airline', 'pilot', 'said', '34', 'F', '34', 'did', 'what', 'needed', 'do', 'like', 'said', 'was', 'magazine', 'shame', 'big', 'budget', 'couple', 'big', 'stars', 'reasonably', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'had', 'end', 'up', 'way']",N/A

They are each given their moment, however the cast as a whole isn't really given too much to do other than react to what happens onscreen. Also, the twist towards the end involving who the villains actually are isn't handled too well and the reasoning behind why they do it is kind of lazy and clich&eacute;.

Unfortunately this was like going to Ruth Chris, ordering the $100 Wagyu burger and getting a fully wrapped Big Mac on your plate.  There's so much wrong with this film I don't know where to begin.  Throw in a bunch of clues before takeoff meant to be the clever who in the whodunit, add the pre-requisite diversions and sprinkle in the necessary stereotypes - the little girl flying alone who dropped her toy or did she?  The Muslim wearing head gear who turns out to be a brain surgeon.  The yuppy black guy on an otherwise mostly white airplane because you know, got to have one of them.  A NYPD officer (the Philly congressman and first to die at the hands of Kevin Spacey in House of Cards) who's going to ""visit his fairy brother who's marrying a guy with a British accent"" because you know marriage equality and all - and add one Air Marshall who's losing his battle with alcoholism and who carries a magic ribbon and who is both shaken and stirred.  Jeez, hold the cheese.  Now get them up in the air.  Make the brilliant beauty Julianne Moore, who rocks a leather jacket, be just another passenger in the window seat and have a couple join the mile high club.  All that's missing is a guitar playing singing nun.  Although they do faithfully add the last minute change of stewardess, I mean flight attendant, to throw us off as she's missing during much of the mayhem.  I bet in one of the writer's meetings the 20 something intern thought that would be clever.So Air Marshall is set up using texting that unless 150,000,000 is wired to an account in 20 minutes someone is going to die and then again every 20 minutes until the money is wired.  The account happens to be the Air Marshall's.  The other Air Marshall is the first to die, at the hands of our hero no less.  And the oh so not clever texter gleefully shows us how clever he thinks he is by getting the Air Marshall to do the first killing for him.  Oh yeah.  There's a briefcase full of coke.  Another 20 minutes and now TSA is thinking Liam is the bad guy.  Oh please.  Haven't they seen all those take my daughter movies?  Next to go is one of pilots from behind his closed pilot door.  Ooooh.  Magic?  Or did our missing stew putting something in the coffee?  Who knows, who cares?  That allows our snarky terrorist to tease with ""who said the next murder would be a passenger?""  Then the bomb packed in cocaine is found.  Did I mention a last minute replacement crew member?Several on board cigarettes, a few cocktails, and some cute child banter later the ransom is paid, the ground thinks the flight is hijacked, we have our ""let's roll"" moment because you just have to give a nod to 9-11 and fighter jets are now escorting the plane to Iceland.  Somehow in the 40 minutes since the flight departed NY at 11pm not only are they close enough to emergency land in Iceland but it's already daylight.  And in one final insult to the intelligence of the audience and a testament to the 20-something brain that wrote this crap the crew uses the slides to get off the plane before any of the passengers.  The fact that economy was configured 2-3-2 is testament to the total fiction that is this waste of electrons.  ""Non-Stop"" is simply a non-stop embarrassment to everyone connected to the production of this film but does, at least, provide about 200 supporting actors a credit and the ability to maintain their health insurance under SAG.  And it ensures that Liam Neeson has another cardboard character to add to his resume.Then there's ""Chariot.""  This is a little two star movie I've been trying to view the trailer for on Amazon streaming video for a few months.  It just simply won't load.  I get an error message that Amazon is unable to stream the trailer.  They want $9 to ""buy"" this film but if I can't see the trailer I'm not interested in wasting $9 on a two star movie that may or may not actually play.  It's about 7 passengers who awaken on a plane who don't know why or how they got there.In looking for the trailer on YouTube I found the entire movie for free so settled back for my 2 star experience at the best price of all, free.  So after they all wake up, panic a bit then settle down to see if their stories match one passenger finds a smart phone  in one of the seat backs and it's tuned to a Houston News station as the anchor is reporting the loss of Boston, Miami, Philly and DC.  Suddenly a blast in the distance and the mushroom cloud and she's off the air.  An incoming call and apparently they have been evacuated.  Or have they?  After the pre-requisite mayhem follows a tight little script that delivers a gripping drama.  I was kind of expecting ground chuck but when I opened the bun there sat a little piece of filet topped with Vidalia onions, mushrooms and a b&eacute;arnaise sauce.  If you're going to spend money on a plane movie - spend the $9 on Amazon to watch Chariot, or better find it for free and leave the ""Non Stop"" nonsense to whoever has an hour forty to waste.

1690641,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00HLTD3ZW,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","&#8220;Non-Stop&#8221; falls into the well traveled cinematic category of &#8220;melodrama in the air.&#8221; The genre goes back to &#8220;Zero Hour,&#8221; the 1957 drama that inspired the hilarious &#8220;Airplane!&#8221;, and continues through &#8220;The High and the Mighty&#8221; (1954), &#8220;Airport&#8221; (1970), and countless others including &#8220;Snakes on a Plane&#8221; (2006).Our hero this time is Bill Marks (Liam Neeson), an air marshal with a serious drinking problem. His life is not going well and he is in nearly bare-knuckled panic as his plane takes off. Fellow passenger Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) speaks soothingly to him and calms his nerves. But his peace of mind doesn&#8217;t last long. A text message blinks onto his phone from an unknown party on the plane threatening that someone on board will die every 20 minutes unless a $150 million ransom is paid.Marks initially suspects a prank in bad taste but nonetheless takes the text seriously and attempts to determine who the sender is. To avoid panicking the 150 passengers aboard, he must do this discreetly. He gets help from flight attendant Nancy (Michelle Dockery, &#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221;) and Jen, who has won his confidence. He is also in contact with his superiors on the ground.Director Jaume Collet-Sera and scriptwriter John W. Richardson build suspense by throwing suspicion on assorted passengers and making clear that Marks, suffering from a recent personal loss and alcohol abuse, is not the perfect hero.Mr. Neeson has made a career of late playing the mild-mannered man who transforms into action hero when circumstances necessitate it. Unlike the earlier &#8220;Taken&#8221; or &#8220;Unknown,&#8221; however, &#8220;Non-Stop&#8221; restricts his derring-do considerably with a claustrophobic setting full of people who would surely panic if they knew the danger facing them.Ms. Moore&#8217;s Jen is a woman who seems all too calm despite knowing the danger facing the plane. She is first seen as jittery and annoying, asking people to change places with her so she can have a window seat. Is this some sort of airplane phobia or something more? When Marks enlists her assistance, she agrees immediately. Why is she so cooperative? Can this be a cover for something more devious?In whodunits of this type, it&#8217;s formulaic to shine suspicion on as many people as possible in order to keep the audience guessing even when things seem clear. Director Collet-Sera does this well, and supplies an interesting variation by directing suspicion, at one point, at Marks himself.Unfortunately, the final third of the movie is a let-down. Once the guilty party is revealed and the motivation explained, the drama falters. It appears the writer wrote himself a solid two-thirds of a screenplay and then ran up against a credibility wall. Mr. Neeson delivers a solid performance and the movie is entertaining enough, but it could have been much richer had the resolution made better sense.Rated PG-13, &#8220;Non-Stop&#8221; plays like an in-flight Agatha Christie mystery. An assortment of suspects is paraded in showy vignettes, giving the audience time to wonder about them, while the suspense mounts as the clock literally ticks down to impending death.",3,Liam Neeson Continues Action Hero Run,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,3257,"['8220', 'Non-Stop', '8221', 'well', 'traveled', 'cinematic', 'category', '8220', 'melodrama', 'air.', '8221', 'genre', 'back', '8220', 'Zero', 'Hour', '8221', '1957', 'drama', 'inspired', 'hilarious', '8220', 'Airplane', '8221', '8220', 'High', 'Mighty', '8221', '1954', '8220', 'Airport', '8221', '1970', 'countless', 'others', 'including', '8220', 'Snakes', 'Plane', '8221', '2006', '.Our', 'hero', 'time', 'Bill', 'Marks', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'air', 'marshal', 'serious', 'drinking', 'problem', 'life', 'not', 'going', 'well', 'nearly', 'bare-knuckled', 'panic', 'plane', 'off', 'Fellow', 'passenger', 'Jen', 'Summers', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'soothingly', 'calms', 'nerves', 'peace', 'mind', 'doesn', '8217', 'last', 'long', 'text', 'message', 'blinks', 'phone', 'unknown', 'party', 'plane', 'threatening', 'someone', 'board', 'will', 'die', '20', 'minutes', '150', 'million', 'ransom', 'paid.Marks', 'initially', 'prank', 'bad', 'taste', 'nonetheless', 'text', 'seriously', 'attempts', 'determine', 'who', 'sender', 'avoid', 'panicking', '150', 'passengers', 'aboard', 'must', 'do', 'discreetly', 'help', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Nancy', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', '8220', 'Downton', 'Abbey', '8221', 'Jen', 'who', 'won', 'confidence', 'also', 'contact', 'superiors', 'ground.Director', 'Jaume', 'Collet-Sera', 'scriptwriter', 'John', 'W.', 'Richardson', 'build', 'suspense', 'throwing', 'suspicion', 'assorted', 'passengers', 'making', 'clear', 'Marks', 'suffering', 'recent', 'personal', 'loss', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'not', 'perfect', 'hero.Mr', 'Neeson', 'made', 'career', 'late', 'playing', 'mild-mannered', 'man', 'who', 'action', 'hero', 'when', 'circumstances', 'necessitate', 'earlier', '8220', 'Taken', '8221', '8220', 'Unknown', '8221', 'however', '8220', 'Non-Stop', '8221', 'derring-do', 'considerably', 'claustrophobic', 'setting', 'full', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'surely', 'panic', 'knew', 'danger', 'facing', 'them.Ms', 'Moore', '8217', 'Jen', 'woman', 'who', 'too', 'calm', 'knowing', 'danger', 'facing', 'plane', 'first', 'seen', 'jittery', 'annoying', 'asking', 'people', 'change', 'places', 'can', 'have', 'window', 'seat', 'sort', 'airplane', 'phobia', 'something', 'more', 'When', 'Marks', 'assistance', 'immediately', 'Why', 'so', 'cooperative', 'Can', 'be', 'cover', 'something', 'more', 'devious', 'whodunits', 'type', '8217', 'formulaic', 'shine', 'suspicion', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'order', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'seem', 'clear', 'Director', 'Collet-Sera', 'well', 'supplies', 'interesting', 'variation', 'directing', 'suspicion', 'one', 'point', 'Marks', 'himself.Unfortunately', 'final', 'third', 'movie', 'let-down', 'guilty', 'party', 'revealed', 'motivation', 'explained', 'drama', 'writer', 'wrote', 'solid', 'two-thirds', 'screenplay', 'then', 'ran', 'up', 'credibility', 'wall', 'Mr.', 'Neeson', 'solid', 'performance', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'richer', 'had', 'resolution', 'made', 'better', 'sense.Rated', 'PG-13', '8220', 'Non-Stop', '8221', 'plays', 'in-flight', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'mystery', 'assortment', 'suspects', 'paraded', 'showy', 'vignettes', 'giving', 'audience', 'time', 'wonder', 'suspense', 'mounts', 'clock', 'literally', 'down', 'impending', 'death']",N/A
1690642,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00HLTD3ZW,The People's Critic,"[1, 1]","It all started when the daughter of a man with &#8220;a particular set of skills&#8221; was suddenly &#34;Taken.&#34;  Now, following a string of successful &#8220;one-man army&#8221; style films, 61-year-old Liam Neeson has undeniably carved out a new niche for himself as a no-holds-barred action hero!Non-Stop is the story of Bill Marks, a U.S. air marshal who finds himself on a trans-Atlantic flight from New York to London.  While in flight, Marks receives a text over his secure cell phone network requesting $150 million be wired into an account or a passenger on the plane will die every 20 minutes.Soon it becomes apparent that the terrorist did not choose Marks&#8217;s plane by accident.  We learn that Marks has had a troubled past; much of it he has tried to erase with alcohol.  40,000 feet above the Atlantic, Marks has no one to trust but himself&#8230;and his particular set of skills.Non-Stop is surprisingly well executed.  Director, Jaume Collet-Serra (Unknown) keeps the pace moving and has a lot of fun while doing it.  Much of the enjoyment of the film revolves around trying to figure out who is texting Marks, and Collet-Serra along with the film&#8217;s three screenwriters make sure that everyone on the plane is a suspect.  Is it the pretty and anxious seatmate, Jen (Julianne Moore)?  Is it the flight attendant from Downton Abbey (Michelle Dockery) or the flight attendant who recently won an Oscar (Lupita Nyong&#8217;o)?  There is no shortage of characters to consider.The other great thing about Non-Stop is how thoroughly entertaining Neeson has become in these types of roles.  The rugged, broguish Irishman commands the screen even when the character he&#8217;s playing is not so confident.  Neeson keeps the audience&#8217;s attention and interest even when the story gets convoluted and implausible.The implausibility of the film&#8217;s final act is the only real nit-pick that I can make, but it is hardly an issue when considering the film&#8217;s overall premise.  Non-Stop is not the first airplane thriller, and it is keenly aware of this.  Instead of falling into &#8220;been there, done that&#8221; caveats, Non-Stop builds on scenarios you&#8217;ve seen before by including them in interesting ways.  When the passengers catch wind that their plane may be high-jacked, several of them consider ganging up on the suspected terrorist, not unlike the passengers of United 93.  The limitations of technology in regards to air travel is explored, and the technical limitations related to the recent disappearance of Malaysian Flight 370 feel that much more eerie in the wake of this film.These references to serious issues are not in bad taste but are true conversation starters about the idiosyncrasies of air travel.  There&#8217;s that, but then there&#8217;s a sudden nose-dive creating a moment of zero-G&#8217;s that send a handgun floating right into Neeson&#8217;s hand at precisely the right moment.  I&#8217;m not sure how long it will be before these Liam Neeson roles begin to seem more funny than fun.  We can probably breathe easily until we see his name in the credits for The Expendables 9: Taken to the Max.

It&#8217;s obvious that Marks has had a rough night and is not looking forward to his day ahead. It&#8217;s a scene that seems more appropriate in a drama instead of an action-thriller and it gives leaves the viewer with a sense of foreboding. That feeling of foreboding increases as Marks leaves his vehicle and it&#8217;s revealed that it&#8217;s a cold and rainy day outside. As Marks goes through the motions of going through security, wandering around the terminal, and waiting for the gate to the plane to open, the melancholy mood stays the same. It&#8217;s not until a young girl drops a stuffed animal as she prepares to board the plane that the mood begins to shift. Marks is getting ready to be enclosed in a relatively small space with over a hundred people for a non-stop flight to London and the sight of the bear and the girl bring a filament of hope to Marks that maybe the voyage won&#8217;t be that bad after all. Of course, that&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t end up being the case as Marks begins receiving text messages over his secured phone that people are going to start dying every twenty-minutes if $150,000,000 isn&#8217;t transferred into an specified account. People start dying and in ways you wouldn&#8217;t expect and an unusual game of cat-and-mouse begins aboard a plane 30,000 feet in the air where the stakes couldn&#8217;t be any higher.Liam Neeson does a great job as Bill Marks. He&#8217;s playing the tough action hero that he&#8217;s played in the majority of his movies over the past five years (TAKEN, THE GREY, UNKNOWN, TAKEN 2, etc.). However, Bill Marks has a bit more edge to him than the typical Neeson hero. For example, Marks is an alcoholic, he&#8217;s a chain smoker, and he&#8217;s not a very polite person. I really like Neeson and I found it a nice change of pace to see him playing a character that, although the hero, has some scruff to him.Although there is some action in the movie, NON-STOP is more like a mystery-thriller than it is an action movie. Part of the fun is trying to figure out who&#8217;s the real murderer. Of course, like most of Agatha Christie&#8217;s stories, even the best of detectives will probably somewhat be stumped and there&#8217;s no way anyone will understand the motivation for their actions.In terms of acting, all of the actors do a good job, but this really isn&#8217;t the type of movie where other performers get to shine. Julianne Moore gets second billing, but other than one or two small little scenes, she&#8217;s kept mostly in the sidelines. NON-STOP is a Liam Neeson action movie and it completely revolves around his character.Overall, NON-STOP is a decent mystery-thriller movie. If you&#8217;re a fan of Neeson, particularly his string of action movies, then you will probably want to check this one out. The ending is a little far-fetched, especially in terms of the characters&#8217; motivations. However, if you can overlook that and you enjoy action-thrillers/mystery-action movies, then you might want to sit back and &#8220;enjoy the flight&#8221; on NON-STOP.",4,"""Enjoy the Flight.""",1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,3209,"['beginning', 'NON-STOP', 'watch', 'U.S.', 'federal', 'air', 'marshal', 'Bill', 'Marks', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'sit', 'vehicle', 'pour', 'booze', 'morning', 'coffee', '8217', 'obvious', 'Marks', 'had', 'rough', 'night', 'not', 'looking', 'forward', 'day', 'ahead', '8217', 's', 'scene', 'more', 'appropriate', 'drama', 'instead', 'action-thriller', 'viewer', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'feeling', 'foreboding', 'increases', 'Marks', 'vehicle', '8217', 'revealed', '8217', 's', 'cold', 'rainy', 'day', 'outside', 'Marks', 'motions', 'going', 'security', 'wandering', 'terminal', 'waiting', 'gate', 'plane', 'open', 'melancholy', 'mood', 'same', '8217', 'not', 'young', 'girl', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'board', 'plane', 'mood', 'shift', 'Marks', 'getting', 'ready', 'be', 'enclosed', 'relatively', 'small', 'space', 'hundred', 'people', 'non-stop', 'flight', 'London', 'sight', 'bear', 'girl', 'bring', 'filament', 'hope', 'Marks', 'maybe', 'voyage', 'won', '8217', 'be', 'bad', 'course', '8217', 'doesn', '8217', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'case', 'Marks', 'receiving', 'text', 'messages', 'secured', 'phone', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'start', 'dying', 'twenty-minutes', '150,000,000', 'isn', '8217', 'transferred', 'specified', 'account', 'People', 'start', 'dying', 'ways', 'wouldn', '8217', 'expect', 'unusual', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'begins', 'plane', '30,000', 'feet', 'air', 'where', 'stakes', 'couldn', '8217', 'be', 'higher.Liam', 'Neeson', 'great', 'job', 'Bill', 'Marks', '8217', 'playing', 'tough', 'action', 'hero', '8217', 'played', 'majority', 'movies', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'TAKEN', 'THE', 'GREY', 'UNKNOWN', 'TAKEN', '2', 'etc.', 'However', 'Bill', 'Marks', 'bit', 'more', 'edge', 'typical', 'Neeson', 'hero', 'example', 'Marks', 'alcoholic', '8217', 'chain', 'smoker', '8217', 'not', 'very', 'polite', 'person', 'really', 'Neeson', 'found', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'see', 'playing', 'character', 'hero', 'scruff', 'him.Although', 'action', 'movie', 'NON-STOP', 'more', 'mystery-thriller', 'action', 'movie', 'Part', 'fun', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', '8217', 's', 'real', 'murderer', 'course', 'most', 'Agatha', 'Christie', '8217', 'stories', 'even', 'best', 'detectives', 'will', 'probably', 'somewhat', 'be', 'stumped', '8217', 'way', 'anyone', 'will', 'understand', 'motivation', 'actions.In', 'terms', 'acting', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'really', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'type', 'movie', 'where', 'other', 'performers', 'get', 'shine', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'second', 'billing', 'other', 'one', 'two', 'small', 'little', 'scenes', '8217', 'kept', 'mostly', 'sidelines', 'NON-STOP', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'action', 'movie', 'completely', 'character.Overall', 'NON-STOP', 'decent', 'mystery-thriller', 'movie', '8217', 're', 'fan', 'Neeson', 'particularly', 'string', 'action', 'movies', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'ending', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'especially', 'terms', 'characters', '8217', 'motivations', 'However', 'can', 'overlook', 'enjoy', 'action-thrillers/mystery-action', 'movies', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'sit', 'back', '8220', 'enjoy', 'flight', '8221', 'NON-STOP']",N/A
