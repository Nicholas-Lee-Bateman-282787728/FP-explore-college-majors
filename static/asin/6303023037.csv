I was already a fan of ""Raise the Red Lantern"" and I was looking for another movie. I actually bought this movie sight un seen. I did not see this movie on cable, like most of the ones I have written reviews. I do not regret spending one dollar on this movie. This is not a epic piece it is set in modern day China.Qiu Ju's husband is kicked in the groin after having a dispute with the village chief. Qiu Ju and Wan wanted to build a storage shed to store chillies that they grew. They needed permission from the chief,he kept refusing their application. The couple even cleared an area of their allocated land to bulid the shed. The Chief was busting chops.In anger Wan said to the chief he would not have any heirs,he could raise only hens(daughters). Fighting words(huh):). Officer Li was interesting in this,he tried to make peace between the two parties. He even spent his own money to make a peace offering. He knew the village Chief (Wang) was a prideful man. Several attempts to make a monetary apology was not accepted. Qiu Ju reminds me of the determined lad in ""Beijing Bicycle"" just that stubborn. She went to all levels of the government to get a verbal apology.  Watch for the turn of events through each level of government she encounters,and the opportunities to let it go. The very person she was seeking the government to force him to apologize,is the same person who saved her life. Unfortunatley in the end she could not save his.",5,Some Times You Have To Let Things Go,1057363200,"07 5, 2003",2003,1527,"['Qiu', 'Ju', 'excellent', 'film', 'First', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'one', 'dynamic', 'director', 'was', 'already', 'fan', 'Raise', 'Red', 'Lantern', 'was', 'looking', 'movie', 'actually', 'bought', 'movie', 'sight', 'un', 'seen', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'movie', 'cable', 'most', 'ones', 'have', 'written', 'reviews', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'spending', 'one', 'dollar', 'movie', 'not', 'epic', 'piece', 'set', 'modern', 'day', 'China.Qiu', 'Ju', 'husband', 'kicked', 'groin', 'having', 'dispute', 'village', 'chief', 'Qiu', 'Ju', 'Wan', 'wanted', 'build', 'storage', 'shed', 'store', 'chillies', 'grew', 'needed', 'permission', 'chief', 'kept', 'refusing', 'application', 'couple', 'even', 'cleared', 'area', 'allocated', 'land', 'bulid', 'shed', 'Chief', 'was', 'busting', 'chops.In', 'anger', 'Wan', 'said', 'chief', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'heirs', 'could', 'raise', 'only', 'hens', 'daughters', 'Fighting', 'words', 'huh', 'Officer', 'Li', 'was', 'interesting', 'tried', 'make', 'peace', 'two', 'parties', 'even', 'spent', 'own', 'money', 'make', 'peace', 'offering', 'knew', 'village', 'Chief', 'Wang', 'was', 'prideful', 'man', 'Several', 'attempts', 'make', 'monetary', 'apology', 'was', 'not', 'accepted', 'Qiu', 'Ju', 'determined', 'lad', 'Beijing', 'Bicycle', 'just', 'stubborn', 'went', 'levels', 'government', 'get', 'verbal', 'apology', 'Watch', 'turn', 'events', 'level', 'government', 'opportunities', 'let', 'go', 'very', 'person', 'was', 'seeking', 'government', 'force', 'apologize', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'saved', 'life', 'Unfortunatley', 'end', 'could', 'not', 'save']",The Story of Qiu Ju VHS

351254,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6303023037,Dennis Littrell,"[78, 78]","This is a story about saving face and winning face, and what can happen if you carry things too far.  Gong Li stars as Qiu Ju, a peasant woman with child whose husband is kicked in the groin by the local chief.  She wants an apology.  The chief of course will not apologize since he would then lose face.  Both are stubborn and obstinate.  Proud and determined, Qiu Ju steers her way through the bureaucracy from the village to the district to the city; but the thing she desires, an apology from the chief, eludes her.  He cannot apologize because he has only sired daughters.  He has license (he believes in his heart) because he was insulted by her husband who said he raised ""only hens.""The Chinese locales, from village roads to big city avenues are presented with stunning clarity so that the color and the sense of life is vivid and compelling.  Director Zhang Yimou. forces us to see.  From the opening shot of the mass of people in the city walking toward us (out of which emerges Qiu Ju) to the feast celebrating the child's first month of life near the end, we feel the humanity of the great mass of the Chinese people.In a sense this is a gentle satire of the bureaucratic state that modern China has become.  But Zhang Yimou emphasizes the bounty of China and not its poverty.  There is a sense of abundance with the corn drying in the eaves, the sheets of dough being cut into noodles, the fat cows on the roads and the bright red chili drying in the sun.  There is snow on the ground and the roads are unpaved, but there is an idyllic feeling of warmth emanating from the people.  One gets the idea that fairness and tolerance will prevail.In another sense, this is a parable about the price of things and how that differs from what is really of value.  So often is price mentioned in the movie that I can tell you that a yuan at the time of the movie was worth about a dollar in its buying power.  (Four and a half yuan for a ""pound"" of chili; five yuan as a fair price for a short cab ride; twenty yuan for a legal letter.)  Getting justice in the strict sense is what Qiu Ju demands.  Her affable husband would settle for a lot less.  He is the wiser of the two.  Notice how Qiu Ju is acutely sensitive to price.  She bargains well and avoids most of the rip offs of the big city.  But what is the value of being a member of the community?  This is a lesson she needs to learn, and, as the movie ends, she does.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",5,A parable of modern China,981331200,"02 5, 2001",2001,2527,"['story', 'saving', 'face', 'winning', 'face', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'carry', 'things', 'too', 'far', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Qiu', 'Ju', 'peasant', 'woman', 'child', 'husband', 'kicked', 'groin', 'local', 'chief', 'apology', 'chief', 'course', 'will', 'not', 'apologize', 'would', 'then', 'lose', 'face', 'are', 'stubborn', 'obstinate', 'Proud', 'determined', 'Qiu', 'Ju', 'way', 'bureaucracy', 'village', 'district', 'city', 'thing', 'apology', 'chief', 'can', 'not', 'apologize', 'only', 'sired', 'daughters', 'license', 'heart', 'was', 'insulted', 'husband', 'who', 'said', 'raised', 'only', 'Chinese', 'locales', 'village', 'roads', 'big', 'city', 'avenues', 'are', 'presented', 'stunning', 'clarity', 'so', 'color', 'sense', 'life', 'vivid', 'compelling', 'Director', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'forces', 'see', 'opening', 'shot', 'mass', 'people', 'city', 'walking', 'Qiu', 'Ju', 'feast', 'celebrating', 'child', 'first', 'month', 'life', 'end', 'feel', 'humanity', 'great', 'mass', 'Chinese', 'people.In', 'sense', 'gentle', 'satire', 'bureaucratic', 'state', 'modern', 'China', 'become', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'bounty', 'China', 'not', 'poverty', 'sense', 'abundance', 'corn', 'drying', 'eaves', 'sheets', 'dough', 'being', 'cut', 'noodles', 'fat', 'cows', 'roads', 'bright', 'red', 'chili', 'drying', 'sun', 'snow', 'ground', 'roads', 'are', 'unpaved', 'idyllic', 'feeling', 'warmth', 'emanating', 'people', 'One', 'idea', 'fairness', 'tolerance', 'will', 'prevail.In', 'sense', 'parable', 'price', 'things', 'how', 'what', 'really', 'value', 'So', 'often', 'price', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'can', 'tell', 'yuan', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'dollar', 'buying', 'power', 'Four', 'half', 'yuan', 'pound', 'chili', 'five', 'yuan', 'fair', 'price', 'short', 'cab', 'ride', 'yuan', 'legal', 'letter', 'Getting', 'justice', 'strict', 'sense', 'what', 'Qiu', 'Ju', 'affable', 'husband', 'would', 'settle', 'lot', 'less', 'wiser', 'two', 'Notice', 'how', 'Qiu', 'Ju', 'acutely', 'sensitive', 'price', 'well', 'most', 'rip', 'offs', 'big', 'city', 'what', 'value', 'being', 'member', 'community', 'lesson', 'learn', 'movie', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote']",The Story of Qiu Ju VHS

Another fine performance by Gong Li in a story that takes too long to reach its disconcerting conclusion. Her character's determined struggle to seek a just settlement for the local Communist party official's assault on her husband is impressive. She is not deterred by physical hardship, swindlers, party bureaucrats, or the arrogance of the party official himself. The plot twist that occurs at the birth of her baby almost redeems the slow pace of the film up to that point of the story, but not quite. The quality of the audio transfer from the film to the DVD is uneven -- muffled in too many places. Misspelled subtitles also detract from the dialogue at times.

351257,A2HCU3HYEYJELG,6303023037,"James Gebhardt ""Film Addict""","[33, 33]","I have to be honest. When I read the Amazon mini-review of this film, I was doubtful as to whether or not this would be my type of film. I'm not even sure why but I just had a feeling. Well, all of my fears quickly dissipated within the first fifteen minutes or so. I quickly became engrossed in this wry little comedy-drama import. Lurking within the guise of a simple drama is a carefully sculpted story of one woman's single-minded mission to acquire satisfaction and justice on behalf of her injured husband.Let me give you a little background first. The film opens with a very pregnant Qiu Ju (played by the brilliant Gong Li) pulling some sort of wagon into town. As it turns out, Qiu Ju (with the help of her sister-in-law, Meizi) is transporting her injured husband, Qinglai to the local doctor for emergency treatment. It is eventually revealed that the husband has suffered an embarrassing injury to his ""oh so private area"" as a result of an argument culminating in an well-placed kick from the village chieftain. Conflict immediately arises from the fact that she sees her husband as being injured, not only physically but, emotionally and spiritually as well. Her laid-back husband, on the other hand, is not as wounded as Qiu Ju would care to believe. He's happier to just move on and let bygones be bygones. This is unsatisfactory for wife, Qiu Ju who proceeds to set into motion an almost comedic series of events ultimately leading to a conclusion that she never anticipated. On its most basic level, this film is a modern day parable that explores the gray area between seeking justice and exacting revenge. It is a cautionary tale as well since it shows that justice is not an absolute. In fact, justice can be a somewhat intangible concept - something that needs to be defined by the human experience. In other words, one person's injustice can be another person's justice. Unfortunately, Qiu Ju lives in a world of black and white. Her simple life and simplistic approach to life affords her no latitude in this matter. As she gradually escalates her grievance upwardly from village, to town, to district, all the way to the big city, her black and white world becomes increasingly grayer. Although her intentions are pure at heart, she fails to see the shortsightedness of her actions. Her myopic view of the world ultimately leads to her downfall. What I find fascinating about this is director Zhang Yimou's ability to tell such a seemingly tragic tale within the framework of a comedy. He does this by telling the story in a most gentle fashion with the most delicate of narrative style.Along the way, the viewer is rewarded with a glimpse into the ever-changing face of mainland China. As Qiu Ju travels from station to station we see the socioeconomic strata of China laid bare as if it were an archeological expedition. I immediately grasped the notion that the heart of China lay in its people. China's true legacy is not The Great Wall nor the Forbidden City. Rather, it is its people and I think this was the intent of the director. Throughout the film, Qiu Ju seems as if she were awash in a sea of humanity. At times, it seems comforting and at others ... frightening. Nonetheless, she moves forward in her mission undeterred. I also think that it was the intent of the director to expose the daunting bureaucratic nightmare that is the Chinese government. A draconian government that has lost sight of the very people that it is meant to serve. So, in a way, the film is an amalgam of comedy, drama and political satire.The tempo of the film is deliberatly slow-paced not unlike Qiu Ju herself. I have a feeling that her brain also processes her experiences at the same exacting rate. The performances are genuine with much attention given to the dialogue. We see that although the Village Chief is in the wrong, he's really not a bad guy. He's stubborn, proud and indignant. We see that although the husband has been wronged, he's not entirely innocent either and must bear some responsibility for what has happened. That is, if he hadn't said what he had said to the Village Chief ... maybe none of this would've happened. This is what simple Qiu Ju fails to understand. People and situations cannot always be easily classified as either ""right"" or ""wrong"". Life is unfortunately more complex and convoluted than she would be willing to accept. As noble as it might seem to hold steadfastly to an ideal, the greater good sometimes arises from recognizing and accepting our own imperfect condition. The film is full of good people, bad people and a lot of people in-between. Although the film takes place in China, there is a sense that it could be just about anywhere in the world since the struggles contained within are so universal in nature. Zhang Yimou is very good at conveying the notion that people are the same wherever you go. I believe that and I think that is why I was so immediately drawn into this story. The film ends with a most poignant moment of self-realitization for Qiu Ju. In keeping within the framework of a parable, sweet Qiu Ju, while so intent on teaching society a lesson ends up being the one who is taught a lesson ... and a very important one at that. I could tell you what it is but, you would be better served by seeing for yourself!",5,The changing face of China,1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,5303,"['have', 'be', 'honest', 'When', 'read', 'Amazon',

I have a richer and I suspect accurate impression of China as a result of Zhang Yimou's intelligent artistry.Alongside this almost documentary-like (yet superior to any documentary I can think of) portrayal of contemporary China, the director also presents a deeply moving and instructive account of the consequences of harmful human behaviors, behaviors that most of us (all of us?) indulge in frequently with little thought to the pain we are causing those around us.  In Qui Ju the circumstances are comic and would remain so did we not see how sadly they play out at the film's end.  A refusal by the village leader to apologize for hurting a man coupled with an equally stubborn refusal by the man's wife Qiu Ju to let go of her grievance bears bitter fruit for all concerned.It is not the stuff of major tragedy but rather the expression of real, every day minor tragedies that makes ""The Story of Qiu Ju"" so poignant and powerful.

The story and plotline are very (almost too) simple; but the character development, and presentation of village, city, and district politics in China and the vast differences between people's lives in those settings is so interesting and intriguing that the movie will keep you amused, interested, and excited, and have you wishing to see more as the credits start rolling at the end of the movie.  This was one of the few movies that actually had me feeling as though I was back in China among so many wonderful friends, sights, and smells, and re-experiencing the oddly comfortable sense of chronic culture shock.

351265,A2EXDP1BBSAFQ6,6303023037,Matthew Watters,"[3, 3]","This may be one of the best films ever made about the law, perfectly illustrating those first-year law school lessons that not every wrong amounts to a legal cause of action (i.e., merits a lawsuit) and that justice does not belong to the wronged individual, but to society as a whole. The law will always fail to satisy a personal sense of having been wronged. In this film, a woman feels slighted by an assault on her husband (a vicious kick in the nuts), and she spends the rest of the film pursuing ""justice"" in the form of an apology from the perpetrator, the local village administrator. The woman just happens to be Chinese, but the subsquent truths about the legal process are nigh universal. The village head is simply unwilling to acknowledge his fault, so various attempts to settle the dispute or find compromise are not enough to satisfy the woman, and she sets the wheels of legal procedure in motion, following them through to their ultimately unsatifsying conclusion as she travels to district and provincial capital cities. The resulting film, as an exercise in frustration, is as essential an addition to the ""literature"" of the law as Dickens' Bleak House or Trollope's Orley Farm, and should be on the curriculum of every law school.  (And a final note: I have never before or since been as impressed by actress Gong Li, who commands the screen by allowing her usual glamourous presence to be utterly subsumed into the character of a pregnant peasant woman. That she still stands out in one crowd scene just by sheer force of her pesonality is a testament to a charisma that, I admit, eluded me in many of her other films.)",4,Required viewing for law students,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,1643,"['may', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'law', 'perfectly', 'illustrating', 'first-year', 'law', 'school', 'lessons', 'not', 'wrong', 'amounts', 'legal', 'cause', 'action', 'i.e.', 'lawsuit', 'justice', 'not', 'belong', 'wronged', 'individual', 'society', 'whole', 'law', 'will', 'always', 'fail', 'satisy', 'personal', 'sense', 'having', 'been', 'wronged', 'film', 'woman', 'feels', 'slighted', 'assault', 'husband', 'vicious', 'kick', 'nuts', 'rest', 'film', 'pursuing', 'justice', 'form', 'apology', 'perpetrator', 'local', 'village', 'administrator', 'woman', 'just', 'be', 'Chinese', 'subsquent', 'truths', 'legal', 'process', 'are', 'nigh', 'universal', 'village', 'head', 'simply', 'unwilling', 'acknowledge', 'fault', 'so', 'various', 'attempts', 'settle', 'dispute', 'find', 'compromise', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'woman', 'wheels', 'legal', 'procedure', 'motion', 'following', 'ultimately', 'unsatifsying', 'conclusion', 'district', 'provincial', 'capital', 'cities', 'resulting', 'film', 'exercise', 'frustration', 'essential', 'addition', 'literature', 'law', 'Dickens', 'Bleak', 'House', 'Trollope', 'Orley', 'Farm', 'should', 'be', 'curriculum', 'law', 'school', 'final', 'note', 'have', 'never', 'before', 'been', 'impressed', 'actress', 'Gong', 'Li', 'who', 'screen', 'allowing', 'usual', 'glamourous', 'presence', 'be', 'utterly', 'subsumed', 'character', 'pregnant', 'peasant', 'woman', 'still', 'out', 'one', 'crowd', 'scene', 'just', 'sheer', 'force', 'pesonality', 'testament', 'charisma', 'admit', 'eluded', 'many', 'other', 'films']",The Story of Qiu Ju VHS

Deming ""Backyard Trees""","[3, 4]","This intensely political and humane film, which I'd characterize as a dark tragedy,  shows how strong Chinese women really are. Although males are more in demand in this China of 1992 - and still apparently are - it is the female heroine, played to perfection by Chinese star Gong Li (""the most purely beautiful woman in the movies,"" according to Vanity Fair) who has more power than anyone, including her poor husband whose honor she is trying - but failing  - to restore. Even he is shocked by her staunch devotion to justice.Director Zhang Yimou constructs the Chinese landscape with opulence and tenderness. Rich colors strike us, reminding us of the colorless society under Chairman Mao.

I won't give the plot away but the final scene is worth rewinding a couple of times on the 1993 video. The last shot is a masterpiece which will long linger with the viewer.

However, before writing a review I was hesitant to write at all, I read the reviews and realized how uneducated I am in many aspects of film and realized much of what I was blind to in my urgency to have some plot development.I understood the point the movie set out to make, it isn't a deep one. That's part of the whole issue with me...the movie is practically a documentary and moves slowly and methodically towards its stupor awakening surprise ending. The study of China is fascinating to be sure and I get the human side of the story. However, I found myself getting frustrated that so little was happening and that the title character was so maddeningly stubborn. Oddly enough, I dreamt of the movie all night long and was amazed at how it had crept into my subconscious so deeply.On the plus side, the performances are perfect and the travel documentary of China, from the pristine snowy farms to the bustling gray and indifferent city is worth watching.I advise someone to be patient, bring an open mind, and seek out the things you might rarely look for in a movie.

Since I find Gong Li to be very beautiful, I can't help be disappointed that you can hardly see her properly throughout the movie, considering she's bundled up most of the time. Also, being that the plot revolves around a complaint that goes through several chains of command due to the same unsatisfactory results, one can't help feel like you're watching the same scenes over and over, which isn't very entertaining (unless you absolutely love that scene to begin with). I mean you can tell that some scenes are even recycled during the film. Don't get me wrong--it's not like I'm someone who can't appreciate the subtlety of things. I realize that we're watching something important and very real to some people, but I'm just warning viewers that the movie's filled with scenes/lines that are basically the same throughout, so if that sounds boring to you, then don't watch this film.

It was well worth the inconvenience (for both of us). It is a simple story that takes on comic proportions as the stubborn protagonist pursues her concept of justice through the snakelike pathways of the bureaucracy to an unexpected outcome - a universal problem that is as much in evidence in a democracy such as North America as it is anywhere.I lived in Hong Kong for twenty years ('66 - '86) and experienced only the farcical soap operas etc of the Hong Kong film industry.  This production was an eye opener for me of the high quality that exists in Chinese films.  It set me on a trail of discovery that has resulted in a substantial number of Chinese films on DVD gracing my bookshelf (some produced by Hong Kong companies - Shaw Brothers (HK))Gong Li plays the role of the relentless, stubborn housewife superbly and is an actress who has built herself a solid reputation for excellence for her roles in many films.  For a contrasting role by this brilliant star, I recommend Shanghai Triad.The film is also expertly crafted and shows how much can be done with a simple story in the hands of skilled film makers.  This is also true of Shanghai Triad which I also remember for its music and photography.Some of the other Chinese films I admire are The Road Home, The King of Masks and Farewell My Concubine (which paved the way for me to the Peking opera The Peony Pavillion).I eagerly await the release of The Story of Qiu Ju for the North American market so it too can take its rightful place on the shelf among my other Chinese DVDs.",5,OUTSTANDING in all respects,1068249600,"11 8, 2003",2003,1687,"['viewed', 'film', 'CVD', 'benefit', 'subtitles', 'had', 'rely', 'Cantonese', 'speaking', 'colleague', 'translate', 'Chinese', 'subtitles', 'was', 'well', 'inconvenience', 'simple', 'story', 'comic', 'proportions', 'stubborn', 'protagonist', 'concept', 'justice', 'snakelike', 'pathways', 'bureaucracy', 'unexpected', 'outcome', 'universal', 'problem', 'as', 'much', 'evidence', 'democracy', 'such', 'North', 'America', 'anywhere.I', 'lived', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'twenty', 'years', ""'66"", ""'86"", 'experienced', 'only', 'farcical', 'soap', 'operas', 'etc', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'industry', 'production', 'was', 'eye', 'opener', 'high', 'quality', 'Chinese', 'films', 'set', 'trail', 'discovery', 'resulted', 'substantial', 'number', 'Chinese', 'films', 'DVD', 'gracing', 'bookshelf', 'produced', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'companies', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'HK', 'Gong', 'Li', 'role', 'relentless', 'stubborn', 'housewife', 'superbly', 'actress', 'who', 'built', 'solid', 'reputation', 'excellence', 'roles', 'many', 'films', 'contrasting', 'role', 'brilliant', 'star', 'recommend', 'Shanghai', 'Triad.The', 'film', 'also', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'simple', 'story', 'hands', 'skilled', 'film', 'makers', 'also', 'true', 'Shanghai', 'Triad', 'also', 'remember', 'music', 'photography.Some', 'other', 'Chinese', 'films', 'admire', 'are', 'Road', 'Home', 'King', 'Masks', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Concubine', 'paved', 'way', 'Peking', 'opera', 'Peony', 'Pavillion', '.I', 'eagerly', 'await', 'release', 'Story', 'Qiu', 'Ju', 'North', 'American', 'market', 'too', 'can', 'take', 'rightful', 'place', 'shelf', 'other', 'Chinese', 'DVDs']",The Story of Qiu Ju VHS
