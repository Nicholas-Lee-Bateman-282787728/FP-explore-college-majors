Cute aliens, but pointy eared aliens nonetheless.What made this show interesting to me is we start to see reality rear it's ugly head & throw a wrench in the perfect harem situation for our male protaganist. Would a bunch of girls who were all in love with the same guy all get along & remain friends like we see in many harem comedies? Of course not. Is every cute girl just as perfect on the inside without any baggage or issues? Of course not. Does a guy eventually have to choose one girl over the others, otherwise face losing everyone? Yes he must. Will that choice be devastating to others, and be a painful situation? Yes it will.Ah, reality. Screwing up a superficial harem comedy and elevating it into something more dramatic.

1345672,A1YJF0MB8R3OFJ,B003H6KRO8,gamerguy1985,"[5, 6]","Let me just say that Rin (the main character in this anime) has the type of luck any red-blooded man would want. He has two MEGA HOT princesses who want him for their husband. One is from the demon world and the other is from the world of the gods. Unfortunately, with extremely hot girls in animes these days comes the psychotic groupies.....if only there were no groupies and you could have both of them for yourself. The story is very heart-warming and the princesses' fathers are pretty funny. The carrot-top (Kaede) turns out to ALSO be in love with Rin (unbeknownst to herself) but it turns out Kaede might be a little off the deep end (you'll discover why later on in the anime.There's the perfect combination of sexiness and romance.

1345673,A3SKWWP4FBHFS5,B003H6KRO8,Matt the Samurai,"[0, 0]","Shuffle is nothing extrodinary...at first anyway.  It begins with the typical ""nice guy"" , Rin in this case, gaining the attention of several beautiful women.  This time around one is the princess of the gods (Sia), and one is the princess of demons (Nerine).  On top of that, several other women start to persue Rin as well.  Honestly I don't see Rin as the nice guy that the show keeps trying to make him out to be...  He's constantly taking advantage of these women, even if he really has no interest in them.  What held the show together for me were the female characters.  Most of them start out as the usual sterotypes, but they quickly gain more and more depth as the series goes on.  Even the women I didn't like ended up becoming interesting characters.  Another problem I had was that the girls don't really get equal focus in the show, but when they did get their turn they developed just as much.  On a positive note, unlike several of the harem series I've seen Rin does make a choice.  It has a great ending that wraps up the main focus of the series, but also leaves it open enough for interpretation and a sequel (though I doubt we see one).  I will say just as a general complaint of harem series in general that it would make sense for the genre if at the end of the series they had either ova's or an entire episode or two about what would've happened if the main character had chosen someone else.  Overall, it's got great characters (for the most part), comedy, animation, and drama towards the end.",4,"A typical harem series, but with a decent twist at the end.",1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,1520,"['Shuffle', 'nothing', 'extrodinary', 'first', 'anyway', 'typical', 'nice', 'guy', 'Rin', 'case', 'gaining', 'attention', 'several', 'beautiful', 'women', 'time', 'one', 'princess', 'gods', 'Sia', 'one', 'princess', 'demons', 'Nerine', 'top', 'several', 'other', 'women', 'start', 'persue', 'Rin', 'as', 'well', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Rin', 'nice', 'guy', 'show', 'trying', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'constantly', 'taking', 'advantage', 'women', 'even', 'really', 'interest', 'What', 'held', 'show', 'together', 'were', 'female', 'characters', 'Most', 'start', 'out', 'usual', 'sterotypes', 'quickly', 'gain', 'more', 'more', 'depth', 'series', 'Even', 'women', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'ended', 'up', 'becoming', 'interesting', 'characters', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'equal', 'focus', 'show', 'when', 'did', 'get', 'turn', 'developed', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'positive', 'note', 'several', 'harem', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Rin', 'make', 'choice', 'great', 'ending', 'up', 'main', 'focus', 'series', 'also', 'open', 'enough', 'interpretation', 'sequel', 'doubt', 'see', 'one', 'will', 'say', 'just', 'general', 'complaint', 'harem', 'series', 'general', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'genre', 'end', 'series', 'had', 'entire', 'episode', 'two', 'what', 'would', ""'ve"", 'happened', 'main', 'character', 'had', 'chosen', 'someone', 'else', 'Overall', 'got', 'great', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'comedy', 'animation', 'drama', 'end']",Shuffle!

1345674,A3KRE8C0WUENEB,B003H6KRO8,my x-girl stole all my DVDs,"[2, 2]","THIS IS THE EPIC ROMANCE ANIME FOR GUYS!No MONSTERS WITH TENTICLES, NO RAPE!!!! Thats all I ask for in my anime. This is my first review because this is the first DVD i found that was so AWESOME! I love action anime like ""Inital D"" and ""Afro Samari"" too, but Shuffle! is a love story.My major issue with the ""romance"" anime is the ""SPAZ OUT"" events. In so many of the ""guy meets girl"" animes there is always some dude spazing out CONSTANTLY. in this one the dude is calm. Hes got all these smokin hot girls around him. They all say all the most seductive things and he plays it cool the whole time. The girls dont start to spazz out until the last few episodes where they confront dude for leading them on, but then they are right back to flirting.Flashing their underpants in just about every episode is about as graphic as this one gets. There is only 2 kisses in the whole thing, a very innocent romantic anime.Listening to the girls talk about how they are helplessly in love is quite refreshing. The the movies out now suck because the women are so cold and demanding. Its every mans dream to have women say they love you, and do things like flashing their underpants in just about every episode over and over for hours. There is no other movie like this and its a shame. :-)600 minutes and every second is worth watching twice!!",5,THIS IS THE EPIC ROMANCE ANIME FOR GUYS!,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,1334,"['THIS', 'THE', 'EPIC', 'ROMANCE', 'ANIME', 'FOR', 'GUYS', 'MONSTERS', 'WITH', 'TENTICLES', 'NO', 'RAPE', 'Thats', 'ask', 'anime', 'first', 'review', 'first', 'DVD', 'i', 'found', 'was', 'so', 'AWESOME', 'love', 'action', 'anime', 'Inital', 'D', 'Afro', 'Samari', 'too', 'Shuffle', 'love', 'story.My', 'major', 'issue', 'romance', 'anime', 'SPAZ', 'OUT', 'events', 'so', 'many', 'guy', 'meets', 'girl', 'animes', 'always', 'dude', 'spazing', 'out', 'CONSTANTLY', 'one', 'dude', 'calm', 'Hes', 'got', 'smokin', 'hot', 'girls', 'say', 'most', 'seductive', 'things', 'whole', 'time', 'girls', 'dont', 'start', 'spazz', 'out', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'where', 'confront', 'dude', 'leading', 'then', 'are', 'right', 'back', 'flirting.Flashing', 'underpants', 'just', 'episode', 'as', 'graphic', 'one', 'only', '2', 'kisses', 'whole', 'thing', 'very', 'innocent', 'romantic', 'anime.Listening', 'girls', 'talk', 'how', 'are', 'helplessly', 'love', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'movies', 'out', 'now', 'suck', 'women', 'are', 'so', 'cold', 'demanding', 'mans', 'dream', 'have', 'women', 'say', 'love', 'do', 'things', 'flashing', 'underpants', 'just', 'episode', 'hours', 'other', 'movie', 'shame', '600', 'minutes', 'second', 'worth', 'watching', 'twice']",Shuffle!
