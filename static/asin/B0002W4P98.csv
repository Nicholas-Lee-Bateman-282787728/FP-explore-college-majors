Please tell me Americans aren't too stupid to watch series from the BBC. I'm American.I've just watched the Complete Series One, the Complete Series Two, and the movie. I've always loved great writing, which could be why I've spent so much of my life trying to create a bit. But I do have a soft spot for great writing combined with great acting, and The Office most certainly has that combination.To call this comedy is like calling M*A*S*H or Barney Miller comedy. Accurate, since we're talking about 30-minute series that are quite funny, but incomplete. In the case of The Office, we have no laugh track, and a grittiness that I finally realized looks a bit like Homicide: Life On The Streets.

So much of what's funny depends on culture and heritage and shared experiences, and this is often difficult to port to another country.It is truly amazing, then, that The Office is so funny to me, an average American viewer. I think that anyone who has worked in an office environment can easily identify with the boredom and alienation of such a setting. There's smoldering romance, ample frustration, and the quintessentially horrible boss played by Ricky Gervais. If you haven't seen the series, here's how to imagine David Brent: picture a boss who is completely incompetent, to start with. Then, picture a man who lacks manners, humor, or grace. Then, imagine that he thinks that he is the funniest, smartest, and sexiest man ever to walk the Earth. That's David Brent, and his inability to be embarassed leads him to say some of the most dreadful things imaginable. These things, though, are quite funny to us, the viewers.Talk about an anti-sitcom. Much of the humor derives from Brent's faux pas, such as his ""performance"" combining Flashdance and MC Hammer dance moves at a company party, or singing a song called ""Freelove Freeway"" during a motivational seminar. In that same episode, he plays Sting's ""Every Breath You Take"" to try to comfort someone on the rocks in a relationship--that's pretty much him in a nutshell. The other cogs in the machine are the office toady Gareth, played by Mackenzie Crook, the receptionist Dawn, played by Lucy Davis, and the likeable Tim, played by Martin Freeman. They all contribute a lot, but this is David Brent's show, and we wouldn't have it any other way.This collection includes the two series and the special, and is an excellent buy.

The American version is great, as it had the best original material source to go by.  Basically, there is humor in everyday living.  In the case of The Office, it's the fumbling comedic hazards of an office manager, David Brent, and the painful, yet hilarious results.  What makes this show solid and work so well with an audience is best summed up by what Tim states in the ending episode, or Part 2 of the Christmas special:""The people you work with, are people you were just thrown together with.

The humor is darker but at the same time more poignant than the American version as the situations and the characters are closer to life. I had seen the American version earlier (which was also great) but I am glad that I bought the British version as it is simply brilliant. Gervais' potrayal of the super egoistical boss who wants to be ""one"" with his office folks is superb. Carrell did a great job in the American version and made us laugh but Gervais simply ""lives"" the character with every glance, every pause (for effect!) and every dialogue. I laughed out loud many times during the episodes and kept laughing later too as I ran into similar situations at work. You'll see David Brent (the boss) or parts of him at your own work place. In fact, I'd be surprised if some of the characters in the series don't remind you of someone you know at work. And that makes the British series even funnier as the direction breathes everyday, mundane office realism into the series.The British version also has jokes and humor which would not have been acceptable in America.

847548,ARA48345JZPZR,B0002W4P98,Archmaker,"[23, 24]","I would probably have missed seeing this fabulous series had I not seen Ricky Gervais on David Letterman.  Letterman said in effect that Ricky's show, The Office, was one of the rare TV comedy series that was hilarious, simply ""perfect"" and an instant classic.  With such high praise I had to seek it out, and I was not disappointed.Excruciatingly funny in its honest and knowing approach to the realities of dull office routine, populated with characters diplaying the everyday weirdness of the everyday people one can find oneself working beside, and filmed with the brilliant creative stroke of a cinema verite documentary style, this is an acute and perceptive look at how people behave and what constitutes the working lives of most of us.That, and it is screamingly funny in its sly and witty, surgical dismemberment of its character's various pretenses.  Like an autopsy done on laughing gas, this is a wincingly hilarious examination of basic human foibles, that cuts deep and true, and yet never loses sight of the flawed humanity therein.Starting with co-creator, writer and director Ricky Gervais's monumentally obtuse, politically incorrect, inept and, usually, stunningly self-deluded office manager, David Brent, forever cringingly doing or saying the absolutely inappropriate thing when not winking at the camera and expounding his inane, self-congratulatory and insipid ""management philosophy"".  It is a fabulously rich character and Gervais plays him to perfection.  Brent is such a total jerk, yet so helplessly so, one simply can't hate him.  It is a rare and marvelous turn, and a great gamble to make your central character such an unsympathetic twit without making him inhuman, and Gervais deserves high praise indeed for both the writing and the performance.The rest of the characters, large and small, are written and played with equal insight and intelligence.  The angular and dense Gareth; the intelligent but stymied Tim; the sweetly trapped and yearning Dawn; the loutish and nasty Chris; the competent and ambitious Neil; Keith,the lumbering accountant, he of the terse and enigmatic observations; and the other office folk we get bits and glimpses of, usually with the telling remark or gesture that reveals.  We see dithering, goofing-off, dead-time, and the aches and fumblings of unrequited office romance.The story arc makes sense and over the course of the series we watch David Brent take himself right over-the-cliff, self-destructing as the ultra-smooth professionals cooly down-size, merge, and eliminate.  Brent is no match for them, and somewhere inside, he knows it.  The wrap special, which takes place 3 years after the supposed documentary has aired, neatly resolves many plot-lines, or at least does so for that moment.  The Office always lets you know that life goes on, and nothing is ever resolved forever.It is a shame to have to write so seriously about something that is so damn funny.  I laughed out loud many many times, and even the painfully wince-inducing behaviour was done with great good humor.  If you liked This Is Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, and A Mighty Wind, you will have the right sensibility for this series.  This is brilliant work here, more true than any ""reality TV"", and well worth your while.",5,Thanks Dave!,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,3286,"['would', 'probably', 'have', 'missed', 'seeing', 'fabulous', 'series', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'David', 'Letterman', 'Letterman', 'said', 'effect', 'Ricky', 'show', 'Office', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'TV', 'comedy', 'series', 'was', 'hilarious', 'simply', 'perfect', 'instant', 'classic', 'such', 'high', 'praise', 'had', 'seek', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.Excruciatingly', 'funny', 'honest', 'knowing', 'approach', 'realities', 'dull', 'office', 'routine', 'populated', 'characters', 'diplaying', 'everyday', 'weirdness', 'everyday', 'people', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'oneself', 'working', 'beside', 'filmed', 'brilliant', 'creative', 'stroke', 'cinema', 'verite', 'documentary', 'style', 'acute', 'perceptive', 'look', 'how', 'people', 'behave', 'what', 'working', 'lives', 'most', 'us.That', 'screamingly', 'funny', 'sly', 'witty', 'surgical', 'dismemberment', 'character', 'various', 'pretenses', 'autopsy', 'done', 'laughing', 'gas', 'wincingly', 'hilarious', 'examination', 'basic', 'human', 'foibles', 'deep', 'true', 'yet', 'never', 'sight', 'flawed', 'humanity', 'therein.Starting', 'co-creator', 'writer', 'director', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'monumentally', 'obtuse', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'inept', 'usually', 'stunningly', 'self-deluded', 'office', 'manager', 'David', 'Brent', 'forever', 'cringingly', 'doing', 'saying', 'absolutely', 'inappropriate', 'thing', 'when', 'not', 'winking', 'camera', 'expounding', 'inane', 'self-congratulatory', 'insipid', 'management', 'philosophy', 'fabulously', 'rich', 'character', 'Gervais', 'perfection', 'Brent', 'such', 'total', 'jerk', 'yet', 'so', 'helplessly', 'so', 'one', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hate', 'rare', 'marvelous', 'turn', 'great', 'gamble', 'make', 'central', 'character', 'unsympathetic', 'twit', 'making', 'inhuman', 'Gervais', 'high', 'praise', 'indeed', 'writing', 'performance.The', 'rest', 'characters', 'large', 'small', 'are', 'written', 'played', 'equal', 'insight', 'intelligence', 'angular', 'dense', 'Gareth', 'intelligent', 'stymied', 'Tim', 'sweetly', 'trapped', 'yearning', 'Dawn', 'loutish', 'nasty', 'Chris', 'competent', 'ambitious', 'Neil', 'Keith', 'lumbering', 'accountant', 'terse', 'enigmatic', 'observations', 'other', 'office', 'folk', 'get', 'bits', 'glimpses', 'usually', 'telling', 'remark', 'gesture', 'reveals', 'see', 'dithering', 'goofing-off', 'dead-time', 'aches', 'fumblings', 'unrequited', 'office', 'romance.The', 'story', 'arc', 'sense', 'course', 'series', 'watch', 'David', 'Brent', 'take', 'right', 'over-the-cliff', 'self-destructing', 'ultra-smooth', 'professionals', 'cooly', 'down-size', 'merge', 'eliminate', 'Brent', 'match', 'somewhere', 'inside', 'wrap', 'special', 'place', '3', 'years', 'supposed', 'documentary', 'aired', 'neatly', 'many', 'plot-lines', 'least', 'so', 'moment', 'Office', 'always', 'know', 'life', 'nothing', 'ever', 'resolved', 'forever.It', 'shame', 'have', 'write', 'so', 'seriously', 'something', 'so', 'damn', 'funny', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'even', 'painfully', 'wince-inducing', 'behaviour', 'was', 'done', 'great', 'good', 'humor', 'liked', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'Best', 'Show', 'A', 'Mighty', 'Wind', 'will', 'have', 'right', 'sensibility', 'series', 'brilliant', 'work', 'here', 'more', 'true', 'reality', 'TV', 'well', 'while']",N/A

Ricky Gervais came up with a good idea, and he executed it as brilliantly as anyone ever has with a TV show.The subject matter is often intentionally benign and boring, providing a perfect backdrop for the show's humor.

How about being forced to implement a stupid office policy because it sounded good to a clueless manager?  Is your cubicle plastered from ceiling to floor with ""Dilbert"" strips that you have actually lived through?If you answered ""yes"" to any of the above, welcome home.  The good folks at The Office will understand all too well!Unless you've seen at least one episode, you're probably skeptical about the above claim that The Office can be ""almost physically unwatchable"" at its best.  Don't be.  Ricky Gervais' portrayal of the ultimate boss from you-know-where really is that accurate.  The only flaw I could find is that it's hard to see how his character, David Brent, could ever make his way up the management ladder in the first place.  But then, guys like him get there all the time in real life.Throughout the series, Brent is madly in love with himself and under the mistaken impression that everyone else shares his affection.  The occasions when he realizes what people really think of him are among the few moments on the show that are funny without being horrifying - but there are very few of those!  Sharing the stage is middle-manager Gareth, an improvement over his boss only in that he is aware that no one respects him, who harbors an unhealthy fascination with his military past.  Then there's mischievous Tim, the drone worker whose mischief is almost always well deserved and whom I always find myself rooting for.  Last but not least is receptionist Dawn, a frustrated artist and the object of Tim's barely tacit affection.  That subplot provides most of the tension throughout the two seasons, as most of the episodes are just day-in-the-life sketches rather than stories.  A dozen or so more minor characters come and go, all of them teriffically portrayed.I was a bit sad at first to learn that there were only two seasons to indulge in, but really, there's no way it could have stayed this good for much longer than that.  The second season is notably more biting than the first, with Brent's antics coming ever closer to the line between amusingly clueless and offensive (even deliberately crossing that line in the season opener).  So it's probably for the best that they quit at the top of their game.

Brent and the other denizens of the office are familiar; they feel like they might be the people you work with, and that's where the viciousness comes in. The characters are so real that it can be painful to watch, if you have anything in your own life to compare it to. The first time I watched the Office through, it put me on edge to quit my job. Not many shows can do that.Brent is awful, but just real enough to be scary, too. Same goes for Gareth, Brent's assistant, who is troublingly fixated on ways to kill people. There is a romance behind it all, with poor, put-upon grunt Tim who pines for the unavailable receptionist Dawn.These characters are brilliantly written and brilliantly acted. But don't think that this is some sleepy character sketch; it's also brutally funny (as for instance, when Brent hijacks his company's training session to play music from his old rock group). You see: this is the evil of this series. These people, mostly good, are forced to suffer David Brent because of the power he holds over them. Anyone on the outside can see quite quickly that he shouldn't hold this power. But people inexplicably wind up in power when they shouldn't be allowed out, let alone in charge. We can also see that, in other circumstances, they'd boot him out of their life in a heartbeat, and rightly so. But, in the office, they can't. In the office, they have to listen to his ""boring, dirty joke."" Just like in real life.I've seen the American version for an episode or two. It's good. Steve Carell is a very talented, very funny man. However, Gervais created the role of David Brent and it's hard to see anyone else try to do it; Gervais oozes Brent in every glance, pause and word.All in all, this is a top-flight show.

Hit Brit-comedy ""The Office"" takes mockumentaries to the small screen, featuring the hilariously unfunny David Brent, and his unhappy employees. This three-pack includes both seasons, plus the satisfying holiday special, which also serves as the grand finale.The first season opens with David Brent (Ricky Gervais) learning that either his branch or another branch of paper corporation Wenham-Hogg will shortly be downsized. So this wannabe-comedian sets out to prove that his branch is better, stumbling as he tries. Trailing in his wake is bored everyman Tim (Martin Freeman), dead-looking yes-man Gareth (MacKenzie Crook), and pretty, quietly cynical receptionist Dawn (Lucy Davis).The second season, while more unsteady than the first, takes some new and darker steps. Now David's rival Neil (Patrick Baladi) is his boss, and David has a slew of new employees who are less than thrilled about his racist jokes, chicken suits, and the lack of any actual work going on. Dawn becomes jealous when Tim gets a girlfriend, and Gareth searches for any way to bed Tim's girlfreind. And after a catastrophic managerial meeting, David learns that the next downsizing just might be him...After the dismal ending of the second season, the feature-length ""Office Special"" provides a satisfying wrap up. Three years later, everyone from Wenham-Hogg -- including those who no longer work there -- is being called back for a special reunion. Tim is given one last chance to win Dawn's affections, and David finally learns the truth about himself. (Anyone disappointed by the end of the second season had better check out the new endings)Don't expect a typical sitcom in ""The Office."" No laughtracks. No punch lines. No gag humor... well, not much. And no episode has a clear-cut ending. Instead, we have the format seen in ""This is Spinal Tap"" and the Christopher Guest mockumentaries -- hidden cameras watching the madness. And what those cameras see is enough to make the world's cubicle-dwellers cry. Okay, most offices don't have giant inflatable genitalia, or a comedy-for-charity day, but the core of it is frighteningly close to home.The series gets off to a slightly bumpy start -- at first, the jokes are a bit too thinly-spread. But soon ""The Office"" gets its footing and the humor steadies itself (""Tim's put my stapler inside a jelly again. That's the third time he's done it!"" Gareth complains, displaying the stapler in a Jell-O mold). And a lot of the humor is a subversive, subtle kind -- it creeps into your mind, and by episode two you'll be laughing your head off at David's bad jokes, his spastic chimp dance, and his prejudices hidden behind a veil of political correctness.Ricky Gervais is brilliant. David is every bit as annoying and obnoxious as the immortal Basil Fawlty, but hides it under a genial mask and stupid jokes. Mackenzie Crook is wonderful as the obsequious boot-licker with a bit of a sex fixation; his Dirty Bertie toy is one of the most tasteless, horribly funny scenes on TV. Tim, like Dilbert, is a lovable loser who can't get himself out of his soul-sucking job. And Dawn is mired in a relationship with an obnoxious cheapskate, yet it takes her the whole series to finally do something about it.Clearly destined for cult status, this is ""The Office"" as it was meant to be, with a darkly funny storyline culminating in a satisfying finale.

Where other programmes rely heavily on very obvious 'gags' that have been very carefully constructed by various groups of scriptwriters, 'The Office' just shows us a mirror image of real life and lets us laugh at how funny and inane it is. Off hand it is difficult to think of many shows which have been written in this fashion which is a pity. Prime time could do with fewer shows that have jokes followed by a symbal crash and canned laughter.Throughout these two series you have loads of characters that will find a place in your heart. David Brent constantly finds the wrong thing to say and it is through Brent that the writers manage to become the masters of the awkward moment, they manage to utilise the discomfort of a failed joke to great comic effect. Gareth's diminutive stature coupled with his constant claims to be an 'army man' never cease to amuse. Indeed he is one of the more regular sit-com style characters.The situation between Tim and Dawn aches with reality and is one with which almost everyone can identify.

In the series, David Brent (Ricky Gervais) manages the regional office of a paper company.  David's branch is in competition with another branch of the company--both branches are trying to avoid being closed, but David's management style does not help, as he is dishonest, manipulative, and bombs with his ham-handed attempts at humor.Sales representative Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman), management assistant Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook), and receptionist Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis) are also leading characters in this show that includes topics in contemporary office life such as petty conflicts and practical jokes, office romances, workplace humor, jockeying for advancement, and after-hours socializing.This DVD set contains both six-episode seasons and both Christmas specials, as well as extra features including a documentary of how the show was made.  Those who appreciate the British style of humo(u)r would appreciate this series, but American audiences should bear in mind that there are R-rated moments in this series that would not be permitted on prime-time TV in the U.S.  I enjoyed the show--while not all of the characters were necessarily likeable, all were interesting, and there were many funny moments.

While it is hilarious in spots, it doesn't put its characters into sitcom like situations, but real ones.  The characters in this series are incredibly well drawn, and are not stock characters.  Considering this is technically a comedy, there's tenderness, sadness, and a real sense of emotion underneath here.  Tim's infatuation with Dawn feels real; it doesn't come across as ""we need a love interest here"".  David Brent is a joke in many ways, but you cringe at what he does because we've all been in situations like this.  You feel sad (not necessarily sorry) for him, because he's trying so hard to be one of the gang.  The show doesn't have contempt for him (like in a lot of American comedies, which have a smugness about them), but shows him in a sympathetic light, even though we're still laughing like hell at him.  There is depth in this series, which is rare for a comedy, whether British or American.  Gervais and co-writer/co-director Stephen Merchant pull this off extraordinarily well.

847575,A2B0XO8BTPRX7R,B0002W4P98,Ian Vance,"[17, 18]","Meet David Brent.  Manager of a small branch of a paper company in Slough, England, Brent keeps a stash of beer in his office for emergencies, fancies himself as a comedian - constantly bombarding his employees with racist, sexist jokes and generally rude behavior - and, overall, struggles with the fact that he is a jumped-up mediocrity quickly aging into marginalized obsoleteness.  Delusional and detestable, Brent masks his profound insecurities with a buffoonish persona that's ""still rock n' roll,"" his need to be the center of attention eventually pulling him into a downward spiral that is both hilarious and incredibly painful to observe.  The man is a trainwreck in motion, and woe to anyone that dares obstruct his progress to the Dark Ends of human petulance.*The Office*, a BBC series that ran for two seasons with a wrap-up Christmas Special, is now being hailed as one of the greatest situational comedies to emerge from the far side of the Atlantic - and rightly so.  Unique from the dross of the mainstream networks, there is no laugh track, no slapstick gags or dull stereotype roles, no happy resolution at the end of each episode.  Laughs come from the dead silences that follow one of Brent's jokes, from character reactions and snide comments, from incredibly awkward moments the like of which have never graced television before.  Built around the clever idea of portraying an average office environment in documentary form, the camera both allows the viewer to be seduced into the ""real"" of its characters and conflict, all the while suggesting the core opportunist streak of David Brent, who shamelessly mugs for this chance at fame, ratcheting up the comedian shtick to an appalling level, alternatively whining about his troubles and using the medium as an aphorism-mirror, building himself up to be a Great Man among the needy proles.  The amount of self-delusion that emerges from these candid glimpses into Brent's fragile state give credit to both the sharp, acerbic writing and the truly astonishing acting ability of co-creator Ricky Gervaise, who fashions a character so life-like and empathetically awful that the audience cannot help but see him as the template for any ambitious idiot somehow maneuvered into a station beyond his abilities.SEASON ONE starts rather casually, with office clown Tim enacting petty prank jokes on the sycophantic Gareth, receptionist Dawn flirting with Tim in what seems a compatible (but unrequited) match, and the employees lazing about, occasionally doing work in the ""chilled out"" atmosphere David Brent has cultivated.  As for Brent, he wanders about with a wan smile and a sort of shallow confidence that hints at the dysfunction beneath, never really working, always keeping an eye out for the camera so he can perform.  He tells awful jokes and laughs loudly in the silence, brags about his drinking ability, baldface lies to his boss, hijacks a training session so he can muse on the good ol' days with his rock n' roll band, fires long-term employees due to redundancies yet hires a pretty PA at the drop of a hat; and constantly, constantly says the wrong thing at the wrong moment, leaving atomic blasts of embarrassment wherever he goes.  It can accurately be stated that The Office is all about laughing at rather than laughing with, all about the ugliness of the human situation and the catharsis resultant in seeing it in such a condensed form.SEASON TWO is where things get nasty.  The paper company merges two offices together and suddenly Brent has a bunch of new employees and a new boss to try and impress and eventually contend with.  The previous season established the characters and a rather lowkey conflict ratio, with the threat of redundancies and Brent himself as major antagonists but most of the humor centered around office gags and reactions to lowbrow antics, coming off very funny yet (relatively) harmless.  In the second season the gloves are off, and the writers methodically strip back the layers of illusion Brent has surrounded himself in, painting a man hell-bent on ingratiating himself into an awkward situation and in turn making everything and everyone miserable.By far more painful than the first season - in that form of ""watching the screen with your hands over your eyes"", croaking laughter at the display of raw brutality - year 2 is also the more psychologically dense.  The new employees from the merger react with disgust to the jokes and bad behavior, chafe at the ""chilled out"" environment Brent tries so strenuously to maintain, smirk at his attempts to appear younger (a make-over that reaches a horrifying peak in the Motivational Speech episode) and gradually come to ignore him completely.  Job threatened and his delusions dangerously breached, Brent breaks down and shows the true colors of his spite, almost oblivious to the omniscient camera except to use it as a platform for his tirades against the ""boring"" new employees and the dashing new Boss. The CHRISTMAS SPECIAL wraps up the loose threads from Season Two in a moving, if still occasionally cringe-worthy, finale.I've only really touched the main threads that make this series such a marvel: throw in the tragic affection between likable everyman Tim and office secretary Dawn, the tyrannical behavior and general clueless nature of lowbrow brownnoser Gareth, the smarmy, sleazy note-perfect 'hustler sales rep' Chris Finch, and you have a show that rivals Faulty Towers for the crown of British comedy.  David Brent even enacts Basil Faulty's most atrocious lapse of bad taste ('The Germans' infamous moustache-and-highkick) to the unamused consternation of his employees, giving both tribute and contrast, for whereas Basil is completely exaggerated and thus relatively safe, a cartoon to laugh at, Brent is borderline crazy and very, very frightening therein.The Office is a fascinating, harrowing exercise in psychological black humor, a catharsis for anyone that has had to work in a stifling corporate environment, and/or dealt with the sort of people the series so keenly depicts.

You are going to lose pounds laughing -- from watching this series.For anyone who has ever worked a desk job or a middle-level manager, worked in sales, or just had a heinous amount of corporate jargon and ridiculous business ideology stuffed down your throat, your will rejoice in the genius ways this film humorously deconstructs not only the problems with corporate ideologues, but also hilarious crisis that develop as a product of stressful relationships in the office.The entire series is engaging, and never comes to a dull point; each episode ending with grippingly hilarious drama and dynamic plot twists with characters you begin to seriously care about --- That's the real genius of this series, even with all of the mockery and hilarity, the characters are rich enough that the viewer inevitably becomes enamored with their lives.I can't speak highly enough for this masterful achievement of cinematic brilliance.

847595,A2VEB9Z1W5DD4C,B0002W4P98,M. Newton,"[9, 9]","The British version of ""The Office"" (which is also the original), is a brilliant, witty, hilarious sitcom that most people will love.  I own this exact set, and everyone I loan it to loves the series.This is not your typical sitcom, and the DVD collection is also very unique.  I want to point out that the ""First & Second Series"" moniker is misleading, since there are only six 30 minute episodes per series (and an additional Special), thus only 13 shows counting the Special, and therefore the entire series is only about 1/2 as long as the typical American sitcom DVD single season collection.  However, this series is actually the perfect length.  It has a beginning and, with the Special, it ends in such a way as to complete the concept.  There are no more seasons after this.  If you're considering buying one season at a time, I highly recommend you buy this collection; otherwise, you'll regret having to buy each season separately.I am not typically a fan of ""British"" humor.  I initially didn't even want to watch a single episode, but once I saw one I was hooked and I bought this collection.  The key to it all is Rick Gervais, who is absolutely amazing as the boss that everyone loves to hate, even though they love to watch him and laugh.  He has apparantly has gift for almost any type of humor including physical comedy.  He is somehow able to connect with viewers in that, even though you would hate to work for him, you still feel bad for him whenever he brings bad things on himself.  Maybe we empathize with him because deep down we know that we're not perfect either and he's able to make us aware of that in such a subtle way that we aren't offended.Tim Freeman and Lucy Davis have a special relationship in the series that everyone will recognize as significant immediately, even though the writers kept the relationship very subtle.  Women in particular seem to really appreciate following the status of those two characters.  There are other characters who also seem to have been born to play their roles.The concept is that the whole series is a ""reality show"" about the goings on in a typical office.  Obviously, it's not a reality show, but the theme really works.  Every episode is hilarious, but that doesn't keep common threads from progressing from episode to episode, culminating in the Special.  The series is not just a laugh fest, it also has a real soul.  You'll want to watch the episodes in the correct order to get the most out of the series.I must warn that there is some crude humor and that this is probably a PG-13 type of series, but this type of humor doesn't go over the top and is typically handled very well.I recommend this box set to just about everyone.

847596,A3IKRFQMOL58FR,B0002W4P98,MorningSciFi,"[8, 8]","The Office is both easy to describe..and yet... not.  It's a fake BBC documentary about an office.  Okay, that's the easy part.  You must give this series a chance-- it will most certainly grow on you.  When I first rented season one, I wasn't sure whether I should even be laughing or not.  The characters were strange, the Office was...well, an office, it was slow paced.  I almost didn't watch the second episode, and then a voice in my head dared me to watch the next episode.  And I did.  And slowly, this cast of characters--characters who seem like real people, the acting is seamless--came alive.  The egotistical, bombastic boss David Brent is so tied up in his own humor that he often times can't see how people really feel about him; meanwhile the series' unofficial main character Tim has a quiet crush on the secretary Dawn.  This is some of the most brilliant humor I have ever encountered.  It shows us the silence and awkwardness that we encounter in the real world all of the time.Perhaps my love of the Office is most summed up in these few sentences:  Every social interaction in this series has such subtleties, such levels of meaning, it makes every exchange between characters either an absolute joy or an awkward silence.  Each character becomes a real human being, not just an office worker on TV.  I found myself caring so much for these people--they're all very quirky and interesting and their personalities run as deep as yours or mine.  The second series is just as great as the first, if not even better; new characters from another branch of the company are introduced, causing further awkward (but hilarious) moments of conflict between Brent and the new boss Neil.  Is the complete DVD set worth it?  Definitely.  It is worth every penny.I have watched straight through each season perhaps 7 or 8 times now, and have re-watched episodes with friends.  And everyone who I have showed it to has requested to watch more on later occasions.  Once you come to love the characters and little jokes from the series, it becomes even funnier.  The ending disc--the Christmas special--is surprisingly my favorite part of the series (Whenever I hear Christmas special I think... ""This can't be too good.."")  Seeing how the characters have changed in the end, the final culmination of the 6 or so hours of episodes you have watched to that point, is truly beautiful.

Based upon the slight exaggeration of annoying characters everybody founds on any boring office, each chapter of half an hour manages to drive the spectator crazy and left him wanting for more at the same time.  ""The Office"" makes masochists of us all.  Because you cannot but watch how David Brent (the incompetent boss that think he is funny) is embarrassed by his actions again and again, and how with each chapter he falls more into perdition and nobody even try to stop his plunge.  He is annoying, is true, but those self-righteous bosses and employees that provoke his demise (in particular in season 2) are not better persons: they're in fact the class of people that make your everyday worse; all repressive regimes in the world are full of them.  ""The Office"" is filmed as a pseudo-documentary (a ""mockumentary"" in buff slang) showing the regular life at a seemingly regular corporation office from nine to five.  This technique limits the kind of outrageous behavior the characters can indulge in and evades in this way the easy traps of proved formulas from ordinary sit-coms.

Fisher ""Ravenya""","[7, 7]","If you haven't already discovered the comedic talents of Ricky Gervais in the award-winning show that shot him to stardom, then this is the perfect gift set to showcase a little phenomenon known as ""The Office"". Ricky Gervais stars as David Brent, the boss at a paper factory in Slough who truly believes he's the Best Person Ever. Although I wouldn't call him ""the world's worst boss"" (he's never truly vindictive toward his co-workers), he would rank as the most tiresome. Convinced that he's popular, admired and the funniest man alive, he endlessly bores his staff with jokes, anecdotes and stories about how wild his weekends were. Their respect for him is non-existent, indulging his persona simply so that they can laugh about him behind his back.Chief amongst these co-workers is Tim Canterbury, a witty and sharp-minded young man whose intelligence belies his inability to get his life together. Stuck in a dead-end job that has something to do with manufacturing paper (he's not entirely sure what), his only ray of sunshine is the office secretary Dawn Tinsley, who shares his sense of humour. Unfortunately, his long-held crush for her is a hopeless one; she's already engaged to the mean-spirited Lee. Rounding out the main cast is Gareth Keenan, one of David's little stooges who is the only one who tolerates him for any length of time - but only because he sees an opportunity to get himself promoted that way. Just as concerned about his own importance as David, he's also been in the army and likes to inform everyone about his expertise on how to survive should one find themselves stranded in the jungle, forced to eat a monkey, or under sniper attack.Season One sets the stage for what's to come; showcasing the banality of the office life and the boredom that sets in around its employees. Filmed as a documentary in which cameramen wander about the office (which is a joke in itself about the dismal quality of reality television; as who on earth would *really* want to watch a show about office life?) The key to this show is its realism; with the exception of a few escapades, everything that happens throughout the series is somewhat totally familiar - the end-of-year parties, the training days, the comic relief days, the integration of new bosses, health and safety lessons, quiz night, office romances and rivalries, we all know what this is like. On the more personal level is the body language, awkward silences, sideways glances and nervous laughter of the actors - its all here in its cringe-inducing glory. Everyone involved deserves an award, right down to the minor characters: the long-winded Anne, the repulsive Finchy, the bemused trainee, the arrogant computer technician, the cleaning lady who sits in on all the meetings, even the janitor who stares confusedly at the cameras (and is actually co-writer Stephen Merchant's father!) And Keith - never forget Keith.There's also an investigation (led by Gareth of course) as to whose behind a computer-doctored image of David, Tim's depressing 30th birthday that accumulates in a shoe being thrown over a pub, a practical joke that ends in tears, an impromptu sing-a-long and the looming threat of redundancy - despite the fact that David has faithfully promised that no one will go.Season Two mainly concerns the sparks that fly over the integration of the Swinton branch with Slough, and the introduction of a group of workers who are used to...you know, actually working. David seethes with jealousy over his new boss Neil - who is as legitimately clever, witty and popular with his workers as David would desperately like to believe *he* is. With an influx of new employees, romance is in the air. Tim catches the eye of the vivacious Racheal, which makes Dawn rather jealous - and Gareth utterly dumbfounded. But has Tim given up on hopes of Dawn finally leaving Lee?Finally the Christmas Special takes place three years after the fallout of the season finale; in which David got fired, Gareth got promoted, Dawn left for America and Tim...went nowhere. Giving all their characters one last chance at happiness (if they dare to take it) Gervais and Merchant pull out all the stops for their big finish; allowing an uplifting finish without sacrificing their trademark black British comedy.Also included in this disk-set is a special CD of David Brent's music, his own rendition of ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"", and his own ""Free Love on the Free Love Highway"". Never tell him this, but it's actually quite catchy! Last of all is a bonus features disk, including an outtake reel, a video diary of how the show is put together and (best of all) deleted scenes, all of which are hilarious.Ricky Gervais's performance has to be seen to be believed, as he fully encapsulates the persona of this immensely unlikeable man; as you laugh, you also cringe for his complete lack of self-awareness. Constantly talking about how he hates racism, sexism and starvation in Africa (whilst displaying complete ignorance on each of these subjects), telling jokes and making impersonations that aren't at all funny, unable to handle any sort of criticism and demanding constant attention, sympathy and gratification from everyone around him, this is one truly sad individual - and certain traits can certainly be recognised in real-life people. Mortification is a typical feeling in watching ""The Office"".The show has since been adapted for an American audience, which (to be fair) has managed to come out from under the shadow of the British version to find its own ground. But nothing can possibly compare to the original masterpiece; which deservedly went down in history as the best British comedy since ""Fawlty Towers"".",5,"""I'm a Friend First and a Boss Second.

847606,AGSWTH7SP2256,B0002W4P98,R. W. Rasband,"[62, 65]","There has been much hype about ""The Office"" being a great sitcom on the level of ""The Honeymooners"" or ""Fawlty Towers"" and it is that, but it's something else, too.  It may be the invention of a new genre you might call the sit-tragi-comedy, because there are many moments in this dark, unforgettable show when the skull beneath the skin of the human condition becomes appallingly visible.  They may sound pretentious (as Ricky Gervais says jokingly about his show on the DVD, it's like Dickens, only better) but ""The Office"" deserves every scrap of praise it gets.It owes a lot to the Christopher Guest mockumentaries like ""Waiting for Guffman"" in which the limits of human self-delusion are scathingly explored.  There's also the achingly tart characterization and wit of ""Fawlty Towers.""  Neil LaBute's savage comedies of sexual combat and office politics seem present as well.  There's also the unmistakable whiff of Samuel Beckett (yes, I said Beckett) in the pacing and style, the emptinesses and Godot-like futility of the work.  Perhaps the greatest aspect of the show is how it combines both mercilessness and compassion at once.  Many of the characters are just awful people, but on the other hand at times they are very painfully aware of it.  As David Brent despairingly wails, after his exploits have supposedly been telecast all over Britain, ""I am not a plonker!""David Brent, brilliantly incarnated by series co-writer and creator Ricky Gervais, is a Frankenstein-like compilation of the worst qualities of every boss you ever despised.  Abusive, dishonest, incompetent, socially inept; yet convinced in his own mind he is a ""chilled-out entertainer and comedian"" before he is a boss, Brent is a walking inducer of cringes and acid reflux.  The only worse person in the place is the truly vile Chris Finch; bully, insult-artist and would-be womanizer. (The bar they frequent, Chasers, is like Dante's Inferno set to disco music.)  The team leader, Gareth, is a weedy little git who believes he is Rambo.  The corporate executives circle the office like sharks, waiting for the next opportunity to cut jobs.  Caught up in the mess are two innocents; Tim, the smart 30-year-old clerk who still lives with his parents and sees through everything and who is in love with Dawn, the sweet receptionist who is engaged to a swinish yob from the warehouse.Scott Adams, of Dilbert fame, says that he is not anti-business but anti-idiot.  I think the same could be said of ""The Office""; although the environment truly is soul-crushing, still most of the characters wounds are self-inflicted.  (The incredibly terrible music video Brent makes with the money from his severance package can be seen in the Christmas special, and it has the power to make your jaw drop to the floor.)  Included on this DVD are both seasons of the show as well as the Christmas special which bring the series to an end.  It's not too much to reveal that the creators do bring a happy ending of sorts; whether you believe it can be sustained even 24 hours after the ""documentary"" cameras have finally been turned off is of course up to you.  A brilliant, classic series.",5,"Hell Is Other People, Indeed",1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,3151,"['been', 'much', 'hype', 'Office', 'being', 'great', 'sitcom', 'level', 'Honeymooners', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'something', 'else', 'too', 'may', 'be', 'invention', 'new', 'genre', 'might', 'call', 'sit-tragi-comedy', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'dark', 'unforgettable', 'show', 'when', 'skull', 'skin', 'human', 'condition', 'appallingly', 'visible', 'may', 'sound', 'pretentious', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'jokingly', 'show', 'DVD', 'Dickens', 'only', 'better', 'Office', 'scrap', 'praise', 'lot', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'mockumentaries', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'limits', 'human', 'self-delusion', 'are', 'scathingly', 'explored', 'also', 'achingly', 'tart', 'characterization', 'wit', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'savage', 'comedies', 'sexual', 'combat', 'office', 'politics', 'seem', 'present', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'unmistakable', 'whiff', 'Samuel', 'Beckett', 'yes', 'said', 'Beckett', 'pacing', 'style', 'emptinesses', 'Godot-like', 'futility', 'work', 'Perhaps', 'greatest', 'aspect', 'show', 'how', 'mercilessness', 'compassion', 'once', 'Many', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'awful', 'people', 'other', 'hand', 'times', 'are', 'very', 'painfully', 'aware', 'David', 'Brent', 'despairingly', 'exploits', 'have', 'supposedly', 'been', 'telecast', 'Britain', 'am', 'not', 'plonker', 'David', 'Brent', 'brilliantly', 'incarnated', 'series', 'co-writer', 'creator', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'Frankenstein-like', 'compilation', 'worst', 'qualities', 'boss', 'ever', 'despised', 'Abusive', 'dishonest', 'incompetent', 'socially', 'inept', 'yet', 'convinced', 'own', 'mind', 'chilled-out', 'entertainer', 'comedian', 'boss', 'Brent', 'walking', 'inducer', 'cringes', 'acid', 'reflux', 'only', 'worse', 'person', 'place', 'truly', 'vile', 'Chris', 'Finch', 'bully', 'insult-artist', 'would-be', 'womanizer', 'bar', 'frequent', 'Chasers', 'Dante', 'Inferno', 'set', 'disco', 'music', 'team', 'leader', 'Gareth', 'weedy', 'little', 'git', 'who', 'Rambo', 'corporate', 'executives', 'circle', 'office', 'sharks', 'waiting', 'next', 'opportunity', 'cut', 'jobs', 'Caught', 'up', 'mess', 'are', 'two', 'innocents', 'Tim', 'smart', '30-year-old', 'clerk', 'who', 'still', 'parents', 'sees', 'everything', 'who', 'love', 'Dawn', 'sweet', 'receptionist', 'who', 'engaged', 'swinish', 'yob', 'warehouse.Scott', 'Adams', 'Dilbert', 'fame', 'not', 'anti-business', 'anti-idiot', 'think', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Office', 'environment', 'truly', 'soul-crushing', 'still', 'most', 'characters', 'wounds', 'are', 'self-inflicted', 'incredibly', 'terrible', 'music', 'video', 'Brent', 'money', 'severance', 'package', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Christmas', 'special', 'power', 'make', 'jaw', 'drop', 'floor', 'Included', 'DVD', 'are', 'seasons', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'Christmas', 'special', 'bring', 'series', 'end', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'reveal', 'creators', 'do', 'bring', 'happy', 'ending', 'sorts', 'believe', 'can', 'be', 'sustained', 'even', '24', 'hours', 'documentary', 'cameras', 'have', 'finally', 'been', 'turned', 'off', 'course', 'up', 'brilliant', 'classic', 'series']",N/A
847607,A31ZVXSLVHLLCN,B0002W4P98,"S. A. Johnson ""misterscooter""","[13, 13]","Here is why I think The Office is so great:IT IS FUNNY, but unlike a lot of the funny TV shows you are used to.  To say that it is funny in a British humour way doesn't even cover it but it is a starting point for Americans who don't know what to expect.  There really aren't any punchlines.  No setup for someone to jump in with a zinger with and a studio audience to laugh at the actors on stage.  But what these people say and do is funny on a lot of levels.  And the laughs range from nervous chuckles to outright belly laughs at times.IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A SITCOM, but it does pull off the feeling of a documentary.  Of course I always wonder if people would really act this way and say these things with the camera on but I suppose it isn't unrealistic with these days of ""reality"" television.  Some of the best moments are the quick cuts to someone's face off scene as they react to what they are listening to.  They don't need to say a word but effortlessly convey a lot of meaning in an eye roll or a sideways glance.IT DOESN'T WEAR ITSELF OUT.  2 seasons.  12 episodes, thirty minutes each (with no commercials breaks!) and a special that comes out to about two episodes.  That's it.  No dragging it out.  The series gets to a high point and stays there and then drops you off like a bad date.  I love this and I hate this about the show.  I'm so used to a series either dragging out too long or being cancelled before its prime.  But I wish more series would do this.  Give us the best and don't let there be a chance for mediocrity.  Of course, the Special does try to give us some closure but it still leaves you wanting more.IT MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE because you know these people.  If you work in an office, more than likely you have seen these people and/or these behaviors at one time or another.  So you laugh because it seems real.  Or you nervously squirm because your're drawn in and it seems real.  But you still watch the train wrecks brought on by David Brent and you slap your head as you shake it and laugh at the same time.  Oh, it is brilliantly uncomfortable.IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE and that is fine.  Some people won't get it.  Some people will get it and not like it.  Some people won't give it a chance because it is British or on DVD now or they are watching the American verion and like it or don't like it or whatever.  That's OK.  Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant made what they think is funny and I agree with that.  If someone else disagrees, it doesn't change how much I admire this show.  To each his own.IT IS MEMORABLE.  This show sticks with you and you want to watch it again and again.  For the office meetings, seminars, visits to the pub, romances, turmoil, ignorance, guitar playing, dancing, and kettle throwing.  I wish there was more but I'm glad there isn't.That is why I love The Office.  I will recommend it to anyone with the warning that you might not like it.  But if you do, I bet you'll love it.",5,A Joy to Behold Because It Hits You In So Many Ways.,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,2962,"['Here', 'why', 'think', 'Office', 'so', 'great', 'IT', 'FUNNY', 'lot', 'funny', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'used', 'say', 'funny', 'British', 'humour', 'way', ""n't"", 'even', 'cover', 'starting', 'point', 'Americans', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'punchlines', 'setup', 'someone', 'jump', 'zinger', 'studio', 'audience', 'laugh', 'actors', 'stage', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'do', 'funny', 'lot', 'levels', 'laughs', 'range', 'nervous', 'chuckles', 'outright', 'belly', 'times.IT', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'FEEL', 'A', 'SITCOM', 'pull', 'off', 'feeling', 'documentary', 'course', 'always', 'wonder', 'people', 'would', 'really', 'act', 'way', 'say', 'things', 'camera', 'suppose', ""n't"", 'unrealistic', 'days', 'reality', 'television', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'quick', 'cuts', 'someone', 'face', 'off', 'scene', 'react', 'what', 'are', 'listening', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'say', 'word', 'effortlessly', 'lot', 'meaning', 'eye', 'roll', 'sideways', 'glance.IT', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'WEAR', 'ITSELF', 'OUT', '2', 'seasons', '12', 'episodes', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'breaks', 'special', 'out', 'two', 'episodes', 'No', 'dragging', 'out', 'series', 'high', 'point', 'stays', 'there', 'then', 'drops', 'off', 'bad', 'date', 'love', 'hate', 'show', ""'m"", 'so', 'used', 'series', 'dragging', 'out', 'too', 'long', 'being', 'cancelled', 'prime', 'wish', 'more', 'series', 'would', 'do', 'Give', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'there', 'be', 'chance', 'mediocrity', 'course', 'Special', 'try', 'give', 'closure', 'still', 'wanting', 'more.IT', 'MAKES', 'YOU', 'FEEL', 'UNCOMFORTABLE', 'know', 'people', 'work', 'office', 'more', 'likely', 'have', 'seen', 'people', 'and/or', 'behaviors', 'one', 'time', 'laugh', 'real', 'nervously', 'squirm', ""'re"", 'drawn', 'real', 'still', 'watch', 'train', 'wrecks', 'brought', 'David', 'Brent', 'slap', 'head', 'shake', 'laugh', 'same', 'time', 'Oh', 'brilliantly', 'uncomfortable.IT', 'IS', 'NOT', 'FOR', 'EVERYONE', 'fine', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'people', 'will', 'get', 'not', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'chance', 'British', 'DVD', 'now', 'are', 'watching', 'American', 'verion', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'OK.', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'Stephen', 'Merchant', 'made', 'what', 'think', 'funny', 'agree', 'someone', 'else', ""n't"", 'change', 'how', 'much', 'admire', 'show', 'own.IT', 'IS', 'MEMORABLE', 'show', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'office', 'meetings', 'seminars', 'visits', 'pub', 'romances', 'turmoil', 'ignorance', 'guitar', 'playing', 'dancing', 'kettle', 'throwing', 'wish', 'was', 'more', ""'m"", 'glad', ""isn't.That"", 'why', 'love', 'Office', 'will', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'warning', 'might', 'not', 'do', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'love']",N/A
