The low-budget and lack of special effects make it more creepy. This movie is pretty average about a group of friends who go and stay in an abandoned farm-house surrounded by vast corn fields in West Virginia. The land was owned by one of the guy's great grandfathers and he inherited it. Rumors were circulating around town about the area being haunted. Supposedly the great grandfather who lived there back in 1932 summoned and made a deal with the devil to keep his crops alive during a drought. His crops were the only crops in the county to be alive. The grandfather became evil himself and killed his wife. The friends are warned that when the harvest moon rises the evil spirits will return for a bloody vengence. And sure enough, the spirits possess the scarecrows and come alive. They have glowing red eyes and make bloodcurdling screams, creepy. The friends are running for their lives as the scarecrows scream and chase them with mechetties, hooks, knives, and hatchets through the corn fields.

Bad acting, inept direction, poor special effects, horrible cinematography and fake looking lighting.I wanted every annoying character in this movie to die off fast so this movie would end quickly! The scarecrows looked so laughable that it was almost unreal. It looked like they bought skeleton masks at Wal-mart during Halloween and used them for this movie. The fake blood looked more like chocolate syrup with cherry sauce mixed in. The lighting in the movie looked so forced and fake that it constantly reminds you that this is a movie. During the outside night scenes it's obvious that there are high-beam lights (spot lights?) shining on the actors and background. Whoever it was that handled the lighting should quit that business for good.The script for the film seemed like it was written up in one night, seriously. We are talking really bad dialogue and characters here! I can't think of a single redeeming feature for this piece of garbage.

802988,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0001FGBTS,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[9, 12]","Okay, to state the obvious: on a technical scale ""Dark Harvest"" isn't exactly the best-produced movie out there, nor did its makers have unlimited resources to draw on.  Now to state the more important: ""Dark Harvest"" is a better, more entertaining, more wathable and more earnest picture than many films with a hundred times its budget and technical finesse Harvest's makers could only grasp at.  It scores most of its points on 3 fronts: premise, performers, and characters.Its premise has a 25-or-so guy inheriting an old, rundown farmhouse and field out in the middle of isolation, and heading out with a group of friends to check it out and see if the place is sellable.  It seems the fields of the property were vastly fruitful cornfields during years of drought that turned all the surrounding farms to dust; decades later it is long abandoned and shunned by the nearby town.  Alright, step one is taken care of - if that's not a fine opening plot for a horror movie I don't know what is.  Next, performers - some are merely competent but several are actually quite impressive.  This leads right into step three, characters - the characters seem very real with their own personalities and personal traits that many movies seem to forget to add in.  Especially likable is the girl played by Jessica Dunphy, who as a bonus during the pondside scene (which also features some other attractive females) bares one of the most beautiful backsides ever captured on film.  To be honest though, she could have still lit up the screen with cute appeal and her character's quietly energetic, bright-and-friendly personality, even if she'd worn an ill-fitting sweatshirt and baggy cargopants the whole movie.  I'm glad she didn't though.The movie does run into trouble with its scarecrow effects.  A significant suspension of disbelief is required on the viewer's part to accept these as real.  Helping with that suspension, the cast credibly acts as they're facing truly threatening, visually frightening entities.I would actually love to see a bigger budget remake of this with the same cast but with some more experience under the belts of the filmmakers, and maybe some more accomplished techicians brought in to help out.  Don't wait for a remake that's probably never going to happen, though.  As it is, with all its bumpiness, this is still a fine movie.I'd give this at least a seven out of ten, maybe a bit higher; definate four out of five stars rather than three.  It's more forgivable for a movie to hit snags due to lack of funds and apparant lack of experience on the part of the well-intentioned filmmakers, than it is to have all the mega-accomplished producers and directors in the world and limitless money and still hit snag after snag and inconsistency after inconstintency due to apparant lack of concern.",4,Many Shortcomings; Succeeds In Spite Of Them,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,2821,"['Okay', 'state', 'obvious', 'technical', 'scale', 'Dark', 'Harvest', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'best-produced', 'movie', 'there', 'did', 'makers', 'have', 'unlimited', 'resources', 'draw', 'Now', 'state', 'more', 'important', 'Dark', 'Harvest', 'better', 'more', 'entertaining', 'more', 'wathable', 'more', 'earnest', 'picture', 'many', 'films', 'hundred', 'times', 'budget', 'technical', 'finesse', 'Harvest', 'makers', 'could', 'only', 'grasp', 'most', 'points', '3', 'fronts', 'premise', 'performers', 'characters.Its', 'premise', '25-or-so', 'guy', 'inheriting', 'old', 'rundown', 'farmhouse', 'field', 'out', 'middle', 'isolation', 'heading', 'out', 'group', 'friends', 'check', 'out', 'see', 'place', 'sellable', 'fields', 'property', 'were', 'vastly', 'fruitful', 'cornfields', 'years', 'drought', 'turned', 'surrounding', 'farms', 'dust', 'decades', 'later', 'long', 'abandoned', 'shunned', 'nearby', 'town', 'Alright', 'step', 'one', 'taken', 'care', 'not', 'fine', 'opening', 'plot', 'horror', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Next', 'performers', 'are', 'merely', 'competent', 'several', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'impressive', 'right', 'step', 'three', 'characters', 'characters', 'seem', 'very', 'real', 'own', 'personalities', 'personal', 'traits', 'many', 'movies', 'seem', 'forget', 'add', 'Especially', 'likable', 'girl', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Dunphy', 'who', 'bonus', 'pondside', 'scene', 'also', 'other', 'attractive', 'females', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'backsides', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'could', 'have', 'still', 'lit', 'up', 'screen', 'cute', 'appeal', 'character', 'quietly', 'energetic', 'bright-and-friendly', 'personality', 'even', ""'d"", 'worn', 'ill-fitting', 'sweatshirt', 'baggy', 'cargopants', 'whole', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'though.The', 'movie', 'run', 'trouble', 'scarecrow', 'effects', 'significant', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'required', 'viewer', 'part', 'accept', 'real', 'Helping', 'suspension', 'cast', 'credibly', ""'re"", 'facing', 'truly', 'threatening', 'visually', 'frightening', 'entities.I', 'would', 'actually', 'love', 'see', 'bigger', 'budget', 'remake', 'same', 'cast', 'more', 'experience', 'belts', 'filmmakers', 'maybe', 'more', 'accomplished', 'techicians', 'brought', 'help', 'out', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'remake', 'probably', 'never', 'going', 'happen', 'though', 'bumpiness', 'still', 'fine', 'movie.I', ""'d"", 'give', 'least', 'seven', 'ten', 'maybe', 'bit', 'higher', 'definate', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'rather', 'three', 'more', 'forgivable', 'movie', 'hit', 'snags', 'due', 'lack', 'funds', 'apparant', 'lack', 'experience', 'part', 'well-intentioned', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'mega-accomplished', 'producers', 'directors', 'world', 'limitless', 'money', 'still', 'hit', 'snag', 'snag', 'inconsistency', 'inconstintency', 'due', 'apparant', 'lack', 'concern']",Dark Harvest
