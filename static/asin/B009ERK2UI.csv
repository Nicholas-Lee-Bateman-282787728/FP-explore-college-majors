1596025,A273D8M7DVZ7FL,B009ERK2UI,Renee Fineberg,"[1, 1]","When this series originally ran on the old CBN ....now known as the FAMILY CHANNEL....I taped every episode on VHS tapes.I still have those tapes...but I bought the DVD's anyway because it is much easier to watch the disks.  The series ran from 1988-1990 (3 seasons).  It may have had a limited budget....but it had many good character actors, writers, and directors.  One of the guests from season 1 is Denny (Scott) Miller of Wagon Train.  Ben Vereen appears in a later episode.  This series could not have been easy to film as it seems to be raining, snowing, or cold much of the time (at least in the early episodes)...and mud seems to be a permanent ingredient of the landscape.  What I liked most about the series was the interaction between the 3 main characters...and just like EMERGENCY and LARAMIE, there is a strong bond between the two male stars.  The friendship between the Marshal and the Mountie makes for good story-telling...sometimes funny, and sometimes not!  Was it a perfect series...No!  But it was entertaining.  Morals and values counted...but there were plenty of villains, shoot-outs, hold-ups, romance, conflicts,....name it, and it was there.  And there were social issues:  race, slavery, immoral behavior, etc.  What we want is to be entertained, and we are!  The episodes are only about 25 minutes long (it was a half-hour show).  There is some continuity from episode to episode, but basically it is a new story each time. I recommend it.  By the way, the cover of the collective tin has been redesigned....it shows the actual actors on the front.

First off, Episode 2 &#34;Medicine Woman&#34;, while it's complete on the &#34;Best Of&#34; set, on this set the episode is missing its teaser and title sequence, which set up the whole plot.  Plus can you ever see the pixels crawl on screen(there was one shot where Marie was wearing a grey hat and the pixels were very visible), since the bit rate on this disc tops out at 3.6Mbps, with the average being right around 2.5-2.7Mbps.  So while there are issues with the video source, this set needed to have been put on 12 discs, instead of 6, for ultimate quality.",3,Missing Footage,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,926,"['first', 'saw', '34', 'Bordertown', '34', 'little', 'yer', 'ago', 'when', '34', 'Best', '34', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'released', 'Canada', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'wonderful', 'clean', 'show', 'Disc', '1', 'had', 'average', 'bit', 'rating', '7.5', '8.5', 'Mbps', 'discs', '2-4', 'had', 'average', '4.5-4.9.I', 'just', 'received', 'Complete', 'series', 'today', 'Boy', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'ever', 'done', 'poor', 'job', 'set', 'First', 'Episode', '2', '34', 'Medicine', 'Woman', '34', 'complete', '34', 'Best', '34', 'set', 'set', 'episode', 'missing', 'teaser', 'title', 'sequence', 'set', 'up', 'whole', 'plot', 'can', 'ever', 'see', 'pixels', 'crawl', 'screen', 'was', 'one', 'shot', 'where', 'Marie', 'was', 'wearing', 'grey', 'hat', 'pixels', 'were', 'very', 'visible', 'bit', 'rate', 'disc', 'out', '3.6Mbps', 'average', 'being', 'right', '2.5-2.7Mbps', 'So', 'are', 'issues', 'video', 'source', 'set', 'needed', 'have', 'been', 'put', '12', 'discs', 'instead', '6', 'ultimate', 'quality']",Bordertown: The Complete Series
