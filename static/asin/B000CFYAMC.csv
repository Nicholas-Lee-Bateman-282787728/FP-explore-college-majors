It has celebrity fans like David Cross (ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT) and Kristen Bell (VERONICA MARS) It's no wonder. It has earned  the respect and admiration of the midnight movie crowd forever. ""The Room"" has gone from a billboard that adorned Los Angeles for FIVE YEARS--to being in people's hearts. The lines are quite easy to memorize.""The Room"" has a simple plot--John (Tommy Wiseau) is engaged to Lisa (who resembles Britney Spears) John resembles Meat Loaf,and has an accent like the current governor of California. John is a banker hoping for a promotion. Lisa's mother,Claudette has breast cancer (well,it's only mentioned once) Then there's the orphan boy Denny who's addicted to drugs (again,it gets only one scene) Wiseau deftly tries to tie together love,ambition,cancer,drugs. Lisa decides to abandon John for his friend Mark,and they have painful-looking sex on the winding staircase. Of course,the sex scenes with Wiseau himself are kind of painful to watch.""The Room"" is sooo bad it's good. I laughed. I cried. I died a little inside.

Anyone who hate this movie can keep their comments in their pockets. Their just too chicken to watch this cinematic masterpeice-cheepcheepcheepcheep-!I should throw a spoon at them. What is The Room, you might ask. Well the Room is a independant movie made by cinematic genious Tommy Wiseau, who's english is just as -cough- awesome as this movie.Listen as the best dialogue come out of the actors mouths as if dubbed in there like some cheap kung fu movie. Its simply fabulous! Heres some examples of the -cough- awesome dialogue (Dark Knight eat your heart out): ""I did not hit her. Eez not true! Ez Bullsheet! Idid not hit her. I-did-not...Oh Hi Mark"". Or this gem: ""YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA""!! -Sniff- That scene always gets to meT_T Or the ending of the movie. Let me just say, most awesome ending ever!The room has to be seen to believe. Its just that unbelievably bad. I first learned about The Room from the Nostalgia Critic and had to find this movie and watch it. I've seen tons of ""So bad their hillarious/awesome/horrible"" kinds of movies. Theres Cursed (hillarious and fun), Howling 2 (hillarious and a big ""Wtf""), Gingerbread Man (hilarious also), Troll 2 (you know), Gay n***** from outter Space (just horrible), Twilight movies (boring, funny, and horrible), and The Titanic animated trilogy (HORRRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!!!) just to name a few (Yes there are more I've watched). The Room has got to be my favorite bad movie due to how hillarious it is. Made even funnier by the fact that Tommy was trying to make a serious movie! I definately recommend inviting some friends over and having a comedy movie night with this. Don't forget to buy some spoons to throw at the screen as well (seriously look it up on Youtube. People in theatres throw spoons at the screen everytime they see a scene that has a portrait of a spoon in the background.

958687,A3ONCOK36KPOV8,B000CFYAMC,A Reviewer,"[1, 1]","I enjoy watching films that are either very good or very very bad. Films that are ""just o.k."" are usually a waste of time in my book. Well, there is nothing o.k. about ""The Room."" It is a veritable master course on how not to make a movie. It is however, so stunningly awful in every imaginable way, as to cross the line into sublime entertainment. At the heart of this trainwreck is of course, Tommy Wiseau. His screenwriting and directing abilities are surpassed only by his horrifying acting. His character seems like an alien being, teleported in from another world (This is only partially due to his vaguely teutonic accent, strange features, and the fact that he is about 30 years older than all the other actors). Despite this, the other characters treat him like one of the gang, and ""a really great guy"" to boot. I couldn't help thinking that he would have been better paired with the mother of his love interest in the movie. The dialog and storyline are nonsensical, character motivations are vague to nonexistent, and minor characters and subplots pop in and out at random. In regard to exposition, there is lots of telling and very little showing (""Johnny is a great guy"", ""Johnny is my best friend,"" etc."") While we are repeatedly told how great ""Johnny"" (Wiseau's character) is, he just seems creepy. There are some strange ""football games"" played at very close quarters, and one memorable scene in which ""Lisa"" is talking to another character. The whole time she is talking, her neck muscles are bulging freakishly on one side only. I was so transfixed by this that I missed what she was saying. All this adds up to an unforgettable cinematic experience.

958689,AVKERKK3WJ6VO,B000CFYAMC,"Bart Connelly ""bartc9000""","[0, 0]","Who knows Tom Wiseau could be a kind and intelligent person.  But this film just shows him to be laughably vain and naive. It reminds me in a way of the kid with the light saber on youtube or more so that person at work who is loud and missing something upstairs.  As with those instances I got to admit I got a good chuckle out of seeing someone act like an idiot.  Afterward felt a bit cruel but still getting enjoyment out of someone embarrassing themselves.  But I am sure Mr. Wiseau is a strong enough person to handle the smirks and people laughing at him and not with.  (in fact in the interview that is an extra on this he makes a good point.  He &#34;finished&#34; the film.  sure its a mess but its much more than those who didnt have the balls to try cough cough...me-best i got was a few 3 minutes movies-and man that was rough).  Anyways enough pompous reflecting.  If you are here you are someone that enjoys bad movies and as bad movies go this one is ok.  The part early on that turns in to a softcore porn film with cheesy supermarket music is not fun but after that its gaffe city and humorous.  In fact in its clumsiness and vanity it becomes in someways more interesting than your run of the mill , &#34;just ok&#34; movie or tv show.  [perhaps some of these really bad movies are more entertaining than the bunch bland films out there.  Its too bad MST3000 never got to give a commentary to Lord of the Rings etc. ]  .As an added note, I must confess I went to film school and did not do very well. In fact I had one short instructional documentary that got lots of unintentional laughs.  I definitely didnt mind the laughter but I do remember me and my classmates acknowledging very quickly that something as simple as a very short instructional video was a tough accomplishment.  20 years later I tried making short films again and one of the results was much like The Room (bad dialogue, no continuity etc).

958690,ALAJL3S09HBS7,B000CFYAMC,Bernard Michael O'Hanlon,"[2, 2]","In yesteryear, supremacy was measured by legions and dreadnoughts, ICBMs and treasury bonds (Hello Beijing). That dynamic changed forever with the release of The Room.  Hegemony is now contingent upon the allegiances of Tommy Wiseau, despot and demiurge. Much like the carpenter's son, it's not surprising that Wikipedia is hazy on his birthdate: this guy is not mere flesh and blood. One wonders whether the Bright Star of the Morning contributed to his parentage. Bush's invasion of Iraq would have been justified if Wiseau had been filming in Baghdad at the time. Parachute him into the Balkans and he would be a latter-day Gavrilo Princip.As The Room makes clear, Wiseau is more destructive than Anton Chigurh, the terminator from No Country for Old Men. There's nothing sanguinary here but the body-bags amass - sanity, aesthetics and faith: they're annihilated one and all. True, Wiseau's acting is more wooden than Sherwood Forest but that's a trap for the unwary; exposure to his non sequiturs, gaudy sex-scenes and semi-intelligible dialogue leads to dementia, ""hydraulic challenges"" and dysentery. Coming off a low base, I shed at least fifty IQ-points in the opening scene alone. The cast are mere asteroids compare with this cosmic phenomenon. Wiseau comes. He sees. He destroys. He is 666 on steroids. It's amazing that foliage does not wither when he comes into range.If you're planning to so something with your life, if you believe in a higher order of things, if family means anything to you, avoid The Room like the pox.",5,The Anti-Word is among Us,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,1538,"['yesteryear', 'supremacy', 'was', 'measured', 'legions', 'dreadnoughts', 'ICBMs', 'treasury', 'bonds', 'Hello', 'Beijing', 'changed', 'forever', 'release', 'Room', 'Hegemony', 'now', 'contingent', 'allegiances', 'Tommy', 'Wiseau', 'despot', 'demiurge', 'Much', 'carpenter', 'son', 'not', 'surprising', 'Wikipedia', 'hazy', 'birthdate', 'guy', 'not', 'mere', 'flesh', 'blood', 'One', 'Bright', 'Star', 'Morning', 'contributed', 'parentage', 'Bush', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'justified', 'Wiseau', 'had', 'been', 'filming', 'Baghdad', 'time', 'Parachute', 'Balkans', 'would', 'be', 'latter-day', 'Gavrilo', 'Princip.As', 'Room', 'clear', 'Wiseau', 'more', 'destructive', 'Anton', 'Chigurh', 'terminator', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'nothing', 'sanguinary', 'here', 'body-bags', 'amass', 'sanity', 'aesthetics', 'faith', ""'re"", 'annihilated', 'one', 'True', 'Wiseau', 'acting', 'more', 'wooden', 'Sherwood', 'Forest', 'trap', 'unwary', 'exposure', 'non', 'sequiturs', 'gaudy', 'sex-scenes', 'semi-intelligible', 'dialogue', 'dementia', 'hydraulic', 'challenges', 'dysentery', 'Coming', 'off', 'low', 'base', 'shed', 'least', 'fifty', 'IQ-points', 'opening', 'scene', 'alone', 'cast', 'are', 'mere', 'asteroids', 'compare', 'cosmic', 'phenomenon', 'Wiseau', '666', 'steroids', 'amazing', 'foliage', 'not', 'wither', 'when', 'range.If', ""'re"", 'planning', 'so', 'something', 'life', 'believe', 'higher', 'order', 'things', 'family', 'anything', 'avoid', 'Room', 'pox']",The Room

958692,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000CFYAMC,calvinnme,"[3, 7]","... it just wasn't that bad. I actually purchased this after I saw a news item on blocks long lines of people waiting to see this film ala ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"".  What I was expecting was ""so bad it's good"". And yes, it is not good, but it is also not so bad that it would really qualify for MST3K. Granted, there are lots of hallmarks of bad filmmaking - wooden performances, strange reactions, subplots that go into a brick wall, and what is it with that footage of Alcatraz between every scene?  This is the story of Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) and his fiancee, Lisa, who discovers she is bored with Johnny shortly before their wedding. A cast of characters pop chaotically in and out of the plot, which include Johnny's voyeuristic young ward and Johnny's best friend who winds up sleeping with Lisa, but does at least show his loyalty to Johnny by whining about it before, during, and after. Lisa's mom's performance is certainly one for the books. She casually mentions she has cancer as though she has mentioned a hangnail and then nothing is ever said about it again. Lisa certainly doesn't seem that worried about her mother's impending doom. Maybe her lack of concern is understandable considering her mother is always telling her she needs to stay with Johnny since Lisa doesn't have what it takes to make it in the job market and needs someone to take care of her. This is a mother figure the way Howard Hughes used to write them.This whole film viewing experience leads me to one conclusion - young people today are both spoiled and deprived when it comes to film. They are spoiled in the sense that they think this is the worst film in history just because of the rather cheap sets and oddly constructed storyline. Independent filmmakers that make such films as a rule have been priced out of the market, and all that is widely released today are prepackaged superhero films with special effects to dazzle and scripts that have no impact on the soul. Young people are also deprived since they don't get to see much ""so bad it's good"" filmmaking either. If you want to see truly bad films that entertain buy some of the 50 movie pack Horror and Sci-Fi film packs - they're cheap - and feast your eyes on ""The Killer Shrews"" with dogs suited up in bath mats as the shrews. Or try theThe Ed Wood Box (Glen or Glenda / Jail Bait / Bride of the Monster / Plan 9 from Outer Space / Night of the Ghouls / The Haunted World of Ed Wood)and see what really bad stream-of-consciousness dialogue and cheap art design are all about.I gave this film three stars because more stars would say it's a good film, which it isn't, and less stars would say it is really bad, possibly to the point of being interesting, and it's not that either.

There's something so appealing in watching people so delusional about their strengths, skill, and talent, and so seduced by ambition and the desire for attention, that they completely humiliate themselves publicly in search of the wrong dream.This Schadenfreude, the taking of joy in the misfortune of others, is what makes ""The Room"" so appealing.Tommy Wiseau was obviously ambitious and hardworking enough to get a movie made, which he wrote, directed and stars in.

This may not be the worst movie ever made (I actually made myself watchManos, the Hands of Fate!), but it's definitely down in the bottom ten -- it's brain-meltingly slow, stuffed with random scenes that accomplish nothing, and has some of the worst acting I've ever assaulted my eyeballs with.Writer/director/producer/""actor"" Tommy Wiseau plays Johnny, a guy living in San Francisco with his fiancee Lisa (Juliette Danielle). When they aren't having slow weird sex, they are hanging around rooftops with their friend Mark (Greg Sestero) or with the world's oldest teenager Denny (Phillip Haldiman). But for some reason Lisa gets sick of Tommy and decides to have sex with Mark (who always seems shocked when she does).There's technically stuff going on in the meantime, such as random people coming to the house to have sex, Lisa's mom revealing she has cancer, a gun-toting drug dealer, and Lisa repeatedly telling everybody that she doesn't love Johnny anymore. But don't worry, none of this actually matters. In fact, if you shaved off all the random filler scenes, this movie would be about twenty minutes long... and if you shaved off the horribly boring sex scenes, it would be five.Let's get this out of the way: ""The Room"" is a steaming pile of excrement. But this is not a run-of-the-mill horrible movie -- there are literally no upsides to this movie. The writing is ghastly (""I did not hit her. I did NAHT. Oh, hi Mark""), the direction is awful, the acting will make your eyes bleed, and there are freaky moments sprinkled throughout it (a creepiy teenager rolling around on a bed with a couple about to have sex).And the acting is so bad that it's actually fun to watch. Oh, most of the actors are merely wooden, bland or absurd, but Tommy Wiseau reaches levels of acting badness that Jennifer Lopez can only dream of. He looks and acts like a zombie that has been dried to beef-jerky and then rehydrated, and speaks in a weird sort of New-Yawk-by-way-of-Paris accent. And his acting... hoo boy, if you can get through the ""You're lyyyying to me Lisa. You're tearing me APAHT!"" scene without laughing, I will pay you money.""The Room"" seems like it was written/directed by a half-asleep monkey with ADD, and the only good thing I can say about it is that it doesn't star Jar Jar Binks.

He is very generous, beloved and giving, yet he is unsuspecting to the treacherous and licentious behaviors of his future wife. The very sexy Lisa is having an affair with Johnny's best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero) on the down low while Johnny's neighbor and surrogate son, Denny, enjoys watching Johnny and Lisa's foreplay. Denny is portrayed as a mentally handicapped university student. Philip Haldiman plays Denny with sincerity and complete creepiness. As this furtive love triangle continues, Johnny contends with lack of promotions at work, Denny's drug problems, Claudette's(Carolyn Minnott as Lisa's mother)diagnosis of breast cancer, Mark's distant behavior and false accusations of drunken domestic violence by Lisa, who looks so sexy in her red dress. As the plans for Johnny's upcoming birthday and wedding, not even scotchka can mask the webs of deceit that are melting around Johnny. Not even the support Michelle, Steven and Peter, johnny's loyal friends, can quell the heartbreak that could awake all as they look in the mirror and answer the burning question, ""Can you ever really trust anyone?""This film is a bizarre, surreal mess! The dialogue is nonsensical and strange, the actions and behavior of the characters are inexplicable, the green screens and lack of sets are laughable, the lack of explanation and resolution for all the subplots is confusing and most of the acting is horrible. At one point, Greg Sestero delivers the line ""Oh come on!"" with the worst acting I have ever seen, which is saying a lot because Mr. Wiseau is not far behind with his bizarre antics on screen. To be fair, Robyn Paris as Michelle and Dan Janjigian as Chris-R provide the only decent acting in this film. Kudos to them for attempting to make lemonade when life handed them some rotten lemons in the form of Wiseau's script.That said, if you think movies can be fun and you have a sense of humor, then add this DVD to your shopping cart and buy it!

958708,A10JDPEQ8GJ2K1,B000CFYAMC,Erik Bateson,"[0, 0]","Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"" is an incredibly bad film. Wiseau wrote, directed, produced and starred in it, and he failed in all four roles.The film involves a love triangle between Johnny (Wiseau), his fiancee Lisa, and his best friend Mark. At the beginning of the film, Lisa has become inexplicably dissatisfied with Johnny, confiding to friends that she finds him boring. Lisa seduces Mark, and they begin an affair that continues throughout the film, even as Mark more than once tries to break it off. Lisa stays with Johnny because he is a successful banker who has promised to buy her a house. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny loses a promotion, Lisa gets closer to leaving Johnny for Mark.The film has several subplots involving secondary characters. A neighboring college student named Denny--whom Johnny supports and loves like a son--has a mysterious run-in with a drug dealer and struggles with his attraction to Lisa; Claudette, Lisa's mother, deals with real estate problems, failed relationships, and breast cancer; Michelle's boyfriend Mike is shamed by Lisa and Claudette walking in on him with Michelle in Johnny and Lisa's living room. All of these subplots are introduced and quickly forgotten, particularly Claudette's breast cancer, which is only mentioned once. Denny has absolutely no character development and seems completely and utterly unnecessary to the film.I will not go into any more detail for those who have not seen the film, suffice it to say that literally nothing works. It's like the world's worst and longest deleted scenes section. And yet...I found myself strangely entertained. The woman who plays Lisa (Juliette Danielle) is written as a beautiful temptress, yet in the film, her looks are not even average. Her acting is even worse. She reads her dialogue as if it were off cue cards. There are several inexplicable love scenes in the film, and they use R&B; slow jams, to a very cheesy effect. The film is filled with obvious continuity errors and bad dubbing, particularly from Wiseau. The film has had something of a cult following, which will likely be its legacy, not unlike a ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" for a new generation, only worse.Though the film fails on every imaginable level, it does so in a way that is completely and utterly entertaining.

The acting is so bad it is apparent that these people either had no shame, or were just overjoyed to be in a feature film.  The dialogue is so stereotypical that it borders on surrealism.  The plot is disjointed, none of it flows, some of it falls by the wayside entirely. (Perfect example- in a conversation between Lisa and her mother, her mother announces:""I got the results of the test back - I definitely have breast cancer.""  and THUS ends the extent of conversation on THAT subject for the duration of the film!)The movie soundtrack (which IS available on CD for your listening pleasure!) is tacky, the sex scenes are drawn out and NOT sexy (i.e. shot after shot of Tommy Wiseau's lumpy rear end).The green screen shots are so lousy it looks like the actors are floating on air!But still...we cannot look away.I believe the fascination lies in the fact that nothing in this movie makes sense!  Basically, it is about a love triangle between a man(?), his ""future wife"", and his best friend.  With a whole lot of unnecessary stuff:Why do people come into Johnny's apartment and sit on the floor, or come by to say hello and then run off because they are very busy- WHY DID YOU COME OVER IN THE FIRST PLACE???Why do men run around in tuxedos throwing a football to each other from ridiculously short distances?Why does Lisa order such a bizarre pizza?Why are there framed pictures of cutlery?Why does Johnny have a mysterious accent that leads you to believe his mother was French/Hungarian/Italian and his father was Portugese/Russian/Klingon?I gave this movie three stars because: it is a terrible fim, yet the entertainment value is definitely there, so it redeems itself.

Each time we watched some of it, we stayed up for awhile talking about it.It is not the worst movie made; the worst movies are those that are never screened.  This is a competently made movie.  It is watchable, it is shot in a way that makes it understandable.But much like Spinal Tap - the band is technically fine, but they just have really bad taste.This movie is packed with bad decision after bad decision.  Some of what I've read about the project explains why it turned out so strange.The dialogue is not as over-the-top as Ed Wood's was.  This dialogue is bad on multiple levels.  When you listen to a conversation, every nuance of line, and every subtext creates one level of badness right on top of the previous one, before any of them has a chance to resolve.For some reason, most of Johnny's dialogue is poorly dubbed.  There are a few reasons for this, detailed more extensively on Wikipedia.  This lends a very peculiar feel to the movie - almost like you're dreaming the whole thing.I could say that this movie is the perfect bad movie, except for one thing - the sex scenes go on too long.  They move from being campy and bad-funny to just being boring.  But to be fair, the novelty is restored by the recycled footage used in them.The DVD itself is acceptable.  It's fine for the price it has, but I'd actually like some more extras.  A commentary would be nice.  The behind-the-scenes footage is surprisingly boring.  The deleted scenes just are an alternate version of an existing scene, shot in a different location.The interview with Wiseau is fascinating as well.  He actually dubs his own lines occasionally during it!The movie is so strange, so surreal, and filled with such bad judgment that the net result is an unforgettable product.

958718,A18ZDBQ8LUNVO6,B000CFYAMC,Jessica McCormick,"[2, 4]","""The Room"" has got to be the worst movie I've ever seen.  That doesn't mean it's the most offensive movie I've voluntarily seen (""The Day After Tomorrow""), or the most irritating (any of the ""Twilight"" movies), this is simply the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure of viewing.  Despite poor research and weak story/acting in the two aforementioned movies, respectively, ""The Room"" has no story, and deadpan reading in place of acting.As my friends and I viewed this with film with Rifftrax, I kept an eye open to watch for lip-syncing so as not to confuse the riffers for the actors.  For at least one full minute, I thought the riffers were simply tearing into Tommy Wiseau before asking everyone, ""Is that actually HIM talking?""  What could the Rifftrax add?  This person was a joke in and of himself!There's really no story to speak of.  Wiseau's character has a fiancee who's constantly cheating on him because she's bored with him.  That's the bulk of it.  At least ""Twilight"" had a simpering little girl to move the (albeit very weak) plot forward, and though the character is as bland as stale toast, we can understand what she is saying.  Not so with Wiseau. And as I mentioned before, there's no lip-reading with this character.  He mumbles at best, and with a thick accent nobody seems to be able to identify.In conclusion of this garbled review for a garbled movie, if you must watch this film, purchase Rifftrax.

You've got Wiseau himself looking and sounding like a bad impersonation of Christopher Walken crossed with Arnold Schwarzenegger; his selfish, cheating fianc&eacute; who looks (a little) like Courtney Love, and his best friend - an Owen Wilson wanna-be - caught up in a tragic story of love and betrayal. And horrible dialogue.This movie is so bad it's great!I don't know if Tommy Wiseau intended for this film to be the cult-classic it is based on it's cheesy acting and production. He struck gold either way. I watched the interview with him in the special features before I even watched the film and knew I was in for a treat. This thing makes soap operas look like Masterpiece Theatre by comparison. I mean, it is soap opera-ish, but oh, Sooooo BADLY done.Dan Aykroyd should do a little return to Leonard Pinth-Garnell on SNL and give this Bad Cinema a proper review.

958725,A3LMVQ8BTEL4VY,B000CFYAMC,Leonard Kirke,"[1, 1]","Disclaimer: I'm giving this film five stars, and I genuinely enjoyed watching this film, but I've been known to have unusual tastes, and to enjoy things that are &#34;craptastic.&#34;I first heard of &#34;The Room&#34; through Rifftrax, the movie riffing group made up of former members of the team behind &#34;Mystery Science Theater 3000.&#34; I love quirky, weird films, and this one did not disappoint me.To give a brief plot synopsis: Johnny, played by auteur writer-director-producer-star Tommy Wiseau, a bank worker, is embroiled in a world of mistrust and intrigue as his fianc&eacute;, Lisa, seems to be cheating on him. Along for the ride are his best friend, Mark, the strange man-child embroiled in drug deals, Denny, and Johnny's other friend, the psychologist Peter, who...sort of...just...kind of...goes away, after a while. Not to worry, though, some other guy (whose name escapes me...heck, I don't think it was even spoken) shows up and takes his place. Last but not least, Lisa's mother, Claudette, rounds out the cast, fighting off her moochy brother and a definite diagnosis of a terrible affliction (no spoilers here!) which, thankfully, she takes in stride...and I mean REALLY takes in stride, so much so that she barely reacts and it's never mentioned again.What can I say? &#34;The Room&#34; is a strange, strange film. Characters show up and then disappear, never to be seen again. Subplots rise and fall like waves on the shore, fading off into the ocean of mystery that is &#34;The Room.&#34; What does the title mean? I don't know. What exactly is Lisa's motivation? I don't know. Who hurt Tommy Wiseau so badly that he was inspired to make a film like this? Again, I don't know.What I do know is that for all its flaws, and perhaps largely because of them, I love &#34;The Room.&#34;If I may be serious for just a moment, I will say this in the film's defense: the cinematography is competent, and despite all the flaws in the writing and bizarre, off-kilter acting, I was just a bit emotionally invested by the film's end, and the film's conclusion actually made me a little sad. I'm not sure if this is because, on at least some level, the film really worked as it was intended to, or if I just felt like the film was such a cry for help from Tommy Wiseau's subconscious that I wanted more of a resolution that let me know that he, in real life, is okay. Something about the film, for me, was strangely affecting, if only in a small way.If I may now return to the silliness, let me assure you that there's plenty of it. Any description I give you here won't do it justice. The weirdness of some of the scenes (an example: suddenly everyone plays football, in tuxedos, in the middle of a parking lot, for absolutely no reason) is memorable...and hilarious. The dialogue is equally hysterical, causing things like &#34;OH HI, MARK!&#34; to become part of the viewer's vocabulary.It really has to be seen to be believed. If you love weird or so-bad-it's-good films, then &#34;The Room&#34; might be right up your alley...especially if you play football in that alley while sharing anecdotes about &#34;me underwears.&#34; (Don't ask.

Recently, however, attention began inundating magazines, blogs, etc: This movie is a cult hit. So, coincidentally in the town I'm living in, someone decided to put on a three-day festival of the worst movies everyone loves to watch. The Room was the finale; a Saturday night showing (at 8 p.m., not the traditional 12 a.m.)on a snowy night in Western New York.An introduction was given, rather hilariously, and the movie began shortly after. I watched in disbelief at how badly good it was. It has been described as though antoher species were writing a movie about human interaction; this seems fitting. However, I think it's more that a person from some Eastern European country (which Tommy Wiseau will not admit to being from) wrote a movie about American interaction, sprinkled with plot holes, disgusting dialogue (meaning it's so bad it's not even human) and awful music. Not to mention the random shots of San Fransisco and what looks like Rome at one point.I laughed, I sighed, I threw spoons at the correct times. It was fun... with other people.I bought this movie in the hopes that I could get my friends into it; this did not work. Plus, watching it with maybe 4 people is not a good idea. It really is just an awful, awful movie. It's good that so much is coming out about it, for example the actors being so fed up with the script that they basically ruined the movie without even trying.So, if you want to enjoy this movie, watch it in a theater.

Yes since The Room took off Tommy Wiseau has claimed he made the film intentionally funny to begin with.  You have to understand Wiseau (as much as any human can) to get why he's saying this. As revealed by Sestero in the excellent &#34;The Disaster Artist&#34; (required reading for any Room fan) Tommy Wiseau really, honestly felt like he was making his magnum opus here. Wiseau thought The Room was a movie where everyone could see reflections of their own lives, and the deep truths of reality. For the rest of us, we have no idea what truths he was aiming at, but that's not important- he thought he was on to something. So when Wiseau says he made this movie a &#34;black comedy&#34; (note that the quote on the box has no source, Tommy wrote all the movie's promo quotes himself.) So what Tommy really means is that he believes people are projecting their own insecurities on the film and that's why they're laughing, like a heroin addict watching a documentary about addiction would try to laugh it off because it hits too close to home. If your head is spinning, here's the short of it- Wiseau didn't fake The Room, and that's precisely why it's such a colossal and endearing flop.",5,"Oh, Hi Amazon!",1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,1257,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', ""n't"", 'been', 'said', 'already', 'here', 'one', 'tip', 'Yes', 'Room', 'took', 'off', 'Tommy', 'Wiseau', 'claimed', 'made', 'film', 'intentionally', 'funny', 'begin', 'have', 'understand', 'Wiseau', 'as', 'much', 'human', 'can', 'get', 'why', 'saying', 'revealed', 'Sestero', 'excellent', '34', 'Disaster', 'Artist', '34', 'required', 'reading', 'Room', 'fan', 'Tommy', 'Wiseau', 'really', 'honestly', 'felt', 'was', 'making', 'magnum', 'opus', 'here', 'Wiseau', 'thought', 'Room', 'was', 'movie', 'where', 'everyone', 'could', 'see', 'reflections', 'own', 'lives', 'deep', 'truths', 'reality', 'rest', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'truths', 'was', 'aiming', 'not', 'important-', 'thought', 'was', 'something', 'So', 'when', 'Wiseau', 'made', 'movie', '34', 'black', 'comedy', '34', 'note', 'quote', 'box', 'source', 'Tommy', 'wrote', 'movie', 'promo', 'what', 'Tommy', 'really', 'people', 'are', 'projecting', 'own', 'insecurities', 'film', 'why', ""'re"", 'laughing', 'heroin', 'addict', 'watching', 'documentary', 'addiction', 'would', 'try', 'laugh', 'off', 'too', 'close', 'home', 'head', 'spinning', 'here', 'short', 'it-', 'Wiseau', 'did', ""n't"", 'fake', 'Room', 'precisely', 'why', 'such', 'colossal', 'endearing', 'flop']",The Room

When reviewing this movie I wish I could give it two different scores: an objective score, and a subjective score. This is the only movie I've ever seen that simultaneously gets a 1 and a 5 from, hence why I averaged my score to a 3. Why do I consider this both a trainwreck and a masterpiece? Well, fellow reader, let me explain.""The Room"" is an independent movie made in 2003 by director/writer/producer/actor Tommy Wiseau. I have not even heard of this movie until last year (2012) and after hearing this movie quoted over and over I just had to see what the hype was about.Let me get the objective part out of the way first. This is the single worst movie I have ever seen of all time.  Everything about it is a disaster. The acting, the production values, the settings, the story...everything. There is no reason anyone should ever watch this movie, and to be quite honest there is no reason for this movie to even exist, other than to fill the spot as ""the worst movie of all time."" I mean this movie doesn't even try to be good. Every single line is delivered with zero emotion and you almost need a translator to understand what the lead role character is saying. Each character is very one-dimensional. There are maybe only 4 sets being used so you are constantly seeing the same locations over and over. At one point I thought I was watching the Twilight Zone as the characters were having the same conversation over and over. It was very difficult to get through this movie without turning it off or falling asleep. And before you ask, yes it really is THAT bad.But yet...I kept watching. And not only that, I watched it MULTIPLE TIMES. I started quoting the movie. Watching clips over and over. Listening to a dubstep mash-up of movie quotes. Watching parodies. Watching and reading reviews, most of which were very entertaining. This movie has become HILARIOUS to me. It was originally billed as a drama, but director/producer/writer/lead actor Tommy Wiseau saw how bad it bombed and quickly changed his words listing it as a ""black comedy"". With the right mindset this movie is hysterical. Most really bad movies tend to be so bad that I want to gouge my eyes out, but this movie is so far gone...so unbelievably unrealistic and bad, that it's funny. Just watch a few clips and you'll understand. Despite being an abysmally terrible movie, it has developed quite the cult following over the years. At first I thought those people were crazy. How can anyone like a movie so bad? Then I quickly realized the magic of it. It's not funny because the movie is full of jokes, the movie itself IS the joke. The movie is one giant punchline, with many self-contained punchlines thrown in for good measure. Practically every new scene is its own punchline. That's why I subjectively give this movie a perfect score.Not everyone is going to see the magic of a movie this bad, and that's fine. Go watch it with an open mind and you'll enjoy it a lot more. Keep in mind this movie was initially supposed to be serious. So to sum it all up, it can best be described as the funniest, most entertaining trainwreck of a movie that has ever been caught on film.

And like most Modern Art, it's difficult to explain.Without a doubt, this is the most awful piece of cinema put on film. And watching this movie is an exercise in self-torture. In fact, this is something that should be outlawed by the Geneva Convention as a torture method. Forget waterboarding and other methods, the CIA should be using this to extract information from targets before the UN and the ACLU gets wind of this film.But let's get to the plot: Johnny, played by the director, Tommy Wiseau, is a banker who is engaged to Lisa (Juliette Danielle). Lisa's an extremely manipulative woman who ends up bringing Mark, Johnny's friend into a love triangle.The movie is billed as a black comedy about love, lies, passion and betrayal. It's funny, alright, but not a black comedy. This is a really awful drama, featuring actors who can't, a production that is topped by most elementary school productions on a $20 budget, and a lack of continuity that would make Ed Wood feel ashamed.Again, this is an awful movie. But why 3 stars? This film is hypnotic. It's awful, but it's hilarious. The acting and dialogue are so awful that you think that the actors are actually acting to be that bad because there's no way that they can possibly *BE* that bad.But why 3 stars? Like all bad movies, some have redeeming qualities. It's important to separate trash from superior trash, and The Room is superior trash simply because it's downright hilarious. Much as some sadists enjoy inflicting pain on others, there's a sick joy that you feel when you share this experience with friends and family (presumably, under the influence of alcohol.) In turn, they'll want to spread word of this movie. Like a modern art masterpiece, it will leave your heads scratching, your eyes hurting and your mind screaming ""YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA!""My advice: Buy this movie, throw a party with lots of alcohol and use this as a bonding experience with friends.

Under normal circumstances, I usually find a bad movie by accident and I will then be drawn to it like a psychotic horse towards a burning stable. Movies like Batman and Robin, Battlefield Earth, and Alone in the Dark fall under this catagory. I will see these movies once in their entirety and then never see them again without wanting to vomit violently. However this was the first time I could remember someone handing this craptastic masterpiece to me. Here was a movie that was so bad that it wasn't good, it was magnificent. The movie was written, produced, directed by Euro Trash god Tommy Wiseau, a man whose acting, directing, writting and producing are so bad that I would rather be waterboarded at gitmo than be in the same room with this maniac. I should perhaps apologize for that last remark because this movie is so gloriously bad that Tommy should have gotten an Oscar for his directing, cinematography, and Orwellian acting that elevates him from ordinary man into an unstopable ogre of hilarity. I can say this for certain: if I saw Tommy Wiseau on the street I would drop to my knees and thank him for making the worst movie of the last 100 years of cinema. I would also tell him that he is the SECOND COMING OF ED WOOD!!!!! This is the PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE for the 21st century. Everything about this film is in a word: BLAHHHHHH!!!! The musical score is fragmented and overly dramatic. When there is a sex scene the music is sappy and suprisingly incomplete. The set pieces are basic and boring and I realized that most of the award winning soft core porn films on skinamax had better acting than this. The plot is so standard that it was made on cardboard, the subplots are poorly thought out and never go anywhere (like when the girlfriend's mother tells her daughter that she has breast cancer so casually that it NEVER GETS REPEATED AGAIN in the movie. I won't give away what happens in the movie, not because I would be spoiling something but because it really needs to be seen to be believied.

958742,A2TP4A79ZRVTHV,B000CFYAMC,Orphan of Sickness,"[3, 3]","Let me warn you: this will probably be one of the worst movies, if not the worst, that you will ever see. Everything is done so poorly, whether it would be the acting, the scenery, the abundance of plot holes, so on and so forth. If I were to count out every single flaw in this film, I might as well count the number of blades of grass on a golf course. Despite all of this, I have never seem a film that's managed to have these moments stick in my head due to how terrible everything is executed.First off, let's keep in mind that the main actor, Tommy Wiseau, also directed, produced and did the screenwriting for this film. The Room aims to be a black comedy that focuses on a love triangle that causes conflict between his role as Johnny, his future wife Lisa and his best friend Mark. They got half of what they're aiming for, as I've laughed the hardest in my life at multiple scenes within this film. First off, when it comes to the acting and dialogue, there are so many questionable phrases and responses within. It's not just the abundance of ""Oh hi [insert name here]"" or Wiseau's thick Eastern European accent that make it phenomenal. Let's take a classic line written and said by Wiseau himself:""I did not hit her, it's not true, it's bulls**t, I did not hit her, I did NOT. Oh, hi Mark.""You thought THAT was bad? Just wait until you watch the scene in its shining glory, and then the rest of the movie speaks for itself.Then there are plot holes that somehow manage to get in the story. For instance, you hear about Lisa's mother saying she has breast cancer in one scene. It is never mentioned again. Come on, if you're going to mention something that's supposed to be as serious as breast cancer, can't you at least bring up whether it's gotten better or worse later on in the film? Or how about how Denny got in trouble for dealing drugs? Mentioned once and never brought back up again.Then we have laughable technical mistakes as well. There's plenty of football passing in this film within about four to six feet within each other. They film the flying football for a few seconds in the air. Either Tommy and crew know how to throw a slow pass to each other that can last as long as a 20 yard pass or they completely screwed up as expected. I'm going for the latter.

958743,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B000CFYAMC,Paul Donovan,"[3, 4]","Oh hi!Before I saw this film for the first time, all I really knew is that some critic called it ""the Citizen Kane of bad movies"". I thought the hyperbole was amusing.But whoever the critic was, they were dead on. That's the only way to describe this jaw-dropping cinematic black hole.This is supposed to be a romantic drama about a man engaged to a woman who doesn't love him anymore and who starts sleeping with his best friend.Like ""Citizen Kane"", this movie is the brainchild of one man. Tommy Wiseau wrote, produced, directed, and stars in it. And like Orson Welles, this is Wiseau's first film. But it's the anti-matter version. For everything that Welles did brilliantly, Wiseau does idiotically. It's like Wiseau (who obviously has a thing for Tennessee Williams) took a crash course in filmmaking... and misunderstood every lesson.Let me make this perfectly clear. There are not just a couple of things wrong with this movie, there are literally hundreds. From the acting, to the script, to the technical production, the whole thing is like an atom bomb waiting to go off. An atom bomb made of spoons.There is no way to adequately describe this film. The main star, Wiseau, has the body and and acting ability of a reanimated corpse. Now combine that with the dialogue's rampant non-sequiturs, the anonymous characters, the plot holes big enough to throw footballs through, and the apartment's mysterious doorways. It must be experienced to be appreciated.

958746,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,B000CFYAMC,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[4, 5]","I'm sorry but I just can't help but laugh at this movie.  Okay, so I gave this two stars because that's all this movie is, which is junk, and it sometimes becomes tedious at times, which can make it a little hard to wade through in contrary to what other people are saying.  But I think it's saying something when this movie is cited to be one of the worst films of all times, and by god, I think it's up there.  And by god, I'll be damned if it isn't a damn good B-movie piece of garbage.From start to finish, this movie is an absolutely joyride of stupid characters, terrible dialogue, utterly pointless and stupid $#% scenes and other things, logic holes bigger than Armageddon, an absolutely boring and inane story, and by far some of the WORST acting I've ever seen from Tommy Wiseau.  Nobody in this movie is even worth paying attention other than to laugh at, and really, these people are lamer than the D @ D playing nerds who avoid showers and spend their time in their basements all day.  Let me just say that when Tommy killed himself, I was crying with joy because I just hated the man (even though he provided some of the best laughter I've had in a while).  I wasn't sure if I wanted to laugh hysterically after what I saw, or cry after the terrible garbage I saw.Tommy just can't write a single convincing dialogue scene, and it's so badly acted that it almost borders on surreal.  Sometimes I can't even tell if it's him talking as it sometimes even seems to be dubbed wrong!  This is one of the worst acting jobs I've ever seen, and most child actor scan school this guy any day of the weak.  Good grief, this guy makes Shaq look like John Travolta (seriously!  I'm being sincere here!), and makes John Travolta look like Peter O' Toole.  I'm pretty sure you've heard it all before, but this is my favorite scene of all time.Johnny: Hi!Clerk: Can I help you?Johnny: Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?Clerk: Oh hi, Johnny, I didn't know it was you.Johnny: That's me!  How much is it?Clerk: It will be 18 dollars.Johnny: Here you go, keep the change, hi doggie.Clerk: You're my favorite customer.Johnny: Thanks a lot. Bye.That whole scene takes 19 seconds from when he's in and when he's out!!!! How in the right mind did the writer even convince himself this is natural? I used to think that talking in movies sometimes hit a little too close to home (as in, come on, does a movie have to have people talking about mundane things? I can do that in life?).  Watching this makes me appreciate John Cassavetes eons more than I already have before, and this incredibly laughable and unrealistic dialogue is probably one of the most surreal scenes I've ever seen in a movie, eve more so that it doesn't include shadow figures, doppelgangers, Lynchian visuals, Cronerberg wackiness, and Jodoroswky images.I won't say much else, but rest assured, by god, have a tissue box handy.

Don't listen to them. While there is no possible angle at which you can look at this movie and call it ""good"", or for that matter even ""adequate"", it is unintentionally hysterical, which gives it enough value that it's become a midnight-movie sensation. Trust me, if you tried that with &lt;em>Zombies Ate My Neighbours: The Movie&lt;/em> or the recent horrific &lt;em>It's Alive&lt;/em> remake or &lt;em>Shopping Mall Jihad&lt;/em> or... you get the idea. This is crap, but it's at least somewhat watchable crap that--probably, anyway--won't make you want to tear your eyes out and reinsert them incorrectly.Plot: Johnny (director Wiseau) is a banker who seems to have everything going for him--he's in line for a big promotion, he's engaged to Lisa (&lt;em>Ghost Shark 2&lt;/em>'s Juliette Danielle), he has a circle of solid friends he can rely on... well, he thinks all this is true, anyway. Lisa no longer loves him, and is determined to get some excitement into her life, mainly by seducing all of his friends.All of which is well and good. Just written out like that, there's no real indication of much about this film (save the absolutely accurate implication that Ms. Danielle, who is almost supernaturally gorgeous, spends an astonishing amount of this movie out of her clothing). A synopsis won't tell you about what may actually be the single worst soundtrack I have ever heard in a film. It can't clue you in to the inept acting displayed by almost everyone in front of the camera, especially Wiseau himself. It can't indicate how badly damaged this script is. In order to find these things out, you have to see this towering monument to bad filmmaking yourself. And as awful a movie as this is (perhaps if I say ""this is worse than &lt;em>Birdemic: Shock and Terror&lt;/em>, you'll get the idea?), I'm still going to tell you that you really do need to see it.

958751,A18TIF1XBW9AQ,B000CFYAMC,"Robert W. Stoll ""Coach Potato extraordinaire""","[5, 5]","This movie is a mess!  Like a heap of refuse with several stinky discarded items mixed in a pile, somehow when all these pieces of junk are fused together it somehow transforms into a diamond of sorts. There are many us who have a peculiar attachment for bad movies.  We love to revel in the awfullness and laugh at the unfortunate ineptitude of the movie makers.  It may sound a bit cruel, but these filmmakers asked us to pay money for their product and expect an honest reaction to their ""vision"", so it's really just part of the artistic process.Back to ""The Room""; it was created by, perhaps this generation's Ed Wood, Tommy Wiseau.  Yes this stringy haired autuer starred, wrote, directed and produced the hell out of this film.  So what is The Room?  It's obvious that Mr. Wiseau intended to make a dark, dramatic story of betrayal.  As the title character Johhny, he's a saint.  Generous, romantic, a successful banker(?), adoptive father (sort of), and beloved by most of the inhabitants of San Fransisco.  Unfortunately our saintly hero is being betrayed by his employer, fiancee and his best friend.  Poor Johnny slowly unravels under all these malicous attacks.  The most cutting of all is the wretched infidelity of his ""bee-yutiful"" girlfriend Lisa with his football tossing best friend, Mark.  Lisa trys to tarnish sweet Johnny's character by claiming that he hit her in a drunken rage.  Nothing will stop this evil harpie from ruining Johhny; she seduces his bestfriend into uh... the stairs(?) and lies to Johnny about being pregnant.  Everything comes to a head at Johnny's birthday party.  In front of all of Johhny's legions of friends and admirers, slutty, evil Lisa exposes her affair and announces that she's not going to marry him.  Everyone leaves and Johnny locks himself in the can.  Stunningly, bee-yutiful but horrid Lisa half heartedly tries to talk him out of the bathroom, but tires quickly of it.  She calls Mark and, rather loudly, announces that Johnny is a baby and she wants to see him.  After heartless Lisa leaves, an anguished Johnny yells like a wounded animal.  He angrily trashes his apartment and then tragically ends it all.  The betrayers, Mark & Lisa, discover the body and become desconsolate.  Sobbing, Mark spurns the manipulative Lisa and the ""adopted"" son Denny, rushes in overcome with the death of his mentor and protector.  Tears from the audience, standing ovation THE END.What Tommy Wiseau envisioned and what he created however, were to disparate things.  Instead of a dark dramatic pyscoligical epic, from a lucky convergence of incompetence was created a cult favorite of bad film.  This film has it all; lame dialogue, performances that alternate between wooden and scene-munchingly over the top.  Classic movie lines like, ""Yew ur tearing me apart, Lisa!!!"" and characters that are breathtakingly bizarre.  Take for example Denny, the so called adoptive son.  He was out on the street and ,heriocally, Johnny gets him an apartment in their building and pays his tuition for school.  Early in the movie, Johnny, Lisa and Denny are together in Johnny's apartment.  Johnny and Lisa decide to go upstairs for some horizontal recreation.  Within moments, Denny sneaks upstairs watchs for a little and then jumps on the bed.  The two lovers explain that 3 is a crowd and Denny announces that he likes to watch (shudder).Then we have the femme fatale, Lisa, who is alleged to be so bee-yutiful by all throughout the movie.  While she isn't a hump-backed troll, she isn't the goddess she's being purported to be.  More accurately, she looks like an attractive linebacker for the Chicago Bears.  Her evil machinations are meant to make our hero, Johnny more sympathetic, but every instance is so contrived due to the inept writing and acting, that the audience is at first stunned.  When the putridity continues, the audience starts to laugh with incredulity.By some bizarre cosmic convergence, this stinky cinematic piece has gained some financial success.  Around the nation, people are coming in droves to watch THE ROOM at midnight shows.  It has become the new Rocky Horror Show, as a audience participation film.

And it is also the worst film ever made (I never thought I would use those two sentences to describe the same film). And I don't make room for a lot of guilty pleasures when it comes to movies. The reason ""The Room"" achieves greatness is because of how much cinematic ineptitude is on display in every scene. There are numerous scenes, characters and lines of dialogue that serve no purpose whatsoever. The writing, the acting, the casting, the directing (ok, everything) in this film is just wrong. At times my jaw was unhinged at just how much lack of filmmaking intelligence was on display (notably a rooftop scene in which Johnny confronts Mark to discuss women). Normally all these things would be a colossal cinematic crime. But it works here because everything that is pointless and awful is so unintentionally funny that it becomes impossible not to enjoy. To see what was intended as a serious melodrama become an unbelieveable laugh riot is a joy beyond description. It should be studied in film schools worldwide to serve as the greatest example of how not to make a film, but also as the best example of cinematic awfulness at its most entertaining. Of course, my review doesn't do the film justice.

958755,A2LDBZRI5GQ4N,B000CFYAMC,Tech Guy,"[0, 0]","Now, I LOVE bad movies: I have seen just about every Uwe Boll movie: one of my favorites of them being ""Alone In The Dark"", and a non-Uwe Boll movie that I love is ""Showgirls"" (This was after Elizabeth Berkeley left Saved By The Bell)...So onto the review....Wow, where do I start?After hearing about this movie on a review site, I decided to take a look for myself on WHY this movie is SO BAD, but yet, SO ENTERTAINING....Here is the premises of the movie: A guy named Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) is madly in love with his live-in fiancee named Lisa (Juliette Danielle), they share an apartment in San Francisco, make love to TERRIBLE R&B-lite; tunes. Everything seems perfect...Right?Wrong!It turns out that Lisa is a BIG FAKER! While admitting to her mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnot) fifteen minutes into the movie that she doesn't love Johnny anymore and doesn't want to be with him anymore. Lisa's mother Claudette tells Lisa that ""Johnny is a good man."" (And trust me, THIS isn't the last time that you will hear this line).After Claudette leaves, Lisa calls Mark (Greg Sestero) who is Johnny's best friend for a ""talk"". Eventually, things get hot and heavy in the apartment with Lisa and Mark as Lisa confesses to Mark that she loves him, not Johnny.Of course with Lisa being the BIG FAKE that she is, she continues to trick Johnny that she loves him until Lisa and Johnny get drunk, and she makes up a story that he hit her while he was drunk.Eventually, Johnny starts to put all of the pieces of this puzzle until the very end.So what makes this movie SO BAD, but yet, SO ENTERTAINING? Here are more than a couple of reasons:First, THE BAD:1. Tommy Wiseau's acting: Wow, where do I start with this one?  His acting is JUST HORRIBLE, and with all perfect honestly, I have seen BETTER acting from elementary school performances than what Tommy Wiseau put into this movie. In the first scene, as soon as he comes into the shot and speaks the opening line in the movie...he talks like Christopher Walken playing a mental patient.2. The subplots: Now, the thing with subplots, they are supposed to add to the story and it also makes the characters interesting with how these characters deal with the issue at hand. Well, there are several subplots in this movie, but they are quickly added and within five minutes, they are quickly forgotten. Like the neighborhood kid Denny (Phillip Haldiman) who has a mysterious run-in with a drug dealer, and struggles with his attraction with Lisa.Claudette (Lisa's mother) deals with real estate problems, failed relationships, and breast cancer, and once it is mentioned, it is quickly forgotten.3. A lot of questions are arisen, but never answered: With Denny telling Lisa that he brought some drugs off of the mysterious drug dealer and owns him some money, he never says what kind of drugs he bought or how much money he owes the drug dealer. Once the drug dealer is gone, he never comes back or bothers Denny again.Claudette telling Lisa (HER DAUGHTER) that she has breast cancer, Lisa tells her mother that ""Everything is going to be all right."" Like, what happened? Did Claudette seek medical help for her breast cancer? Again, it's brought up and never answered.Although it is quite clear that he is in college, it is not clear (or talked about) whether Denny is a fully-functioning adult. This character is quite ignorant of social standards; like when Johnny and Lisa go upstairs to make love, Denny comes up to the bedroom and starts throwing pillows with Johnny and Lisa, and what happens is, let's just say, a little strange.Now, you may be wondering...since I have bashed so much about this movie, what is so entertaining about this movie? Well, let me explain:1. The script: Yes, there are repeated lines in this movie i.e.; ""Johnny is a good man."", ""Johnny is my best friend.""..etc...it's this one scene with Johnny and Mark on the roof where Johnny comes up and he is on the phone after Lisa spreads the lie about him hitting her...It's priceless.2. The acting: Although Tommy Wiseau talks like Christopher Walken playing a mental patient, his acting on camera is so FUNNY, and some of the lines he say's in this movie are either outright HILARIOUS or sometimes just outright STRANGE.Tommy Wiseau is not the only one with bad acting, most (if not all) of the actors have hooky acting, but not as bad as Tommy Wiseau's...So, if you are into movies that are terrible-but-good at the same time, than pick up a copy of ""The Room"".",5,"""Let's Go Eat, Huh.""",1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,4481,"['Now', 'LOVE', 'bad', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'just', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'movie', 'one', 'favorites', 'being', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'non-Uwe', 'Boll', 'movie', 'love', 'Showgirls', 'was', 'Elizabeth', 'Berkeley', 'left', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'So', 'review', '.Wow', 'where', 'do', 'start', 'hearing', 'movie', 'review', 'site', 'decided', 'take', 'look', 'myself', 'WHY', 'movie', 'SO', 'BAD', 'yet', 'ENTERTAINING', 'premises', 'movie', 'guy', 'named', 'Johnny', 'Tommy', 'Wiseau', 'madly', 'love', 'live-in', 'fiancee', 'named', 'Lisa', 'Juliette', 'Danielle', 'share', 'apartment', 'San', 'Francisco', 'make', 'love', 'TERRIBLE', 'R', 'B-lite', 'tunes', 'Everything', 'perfect', 'Right', 'Wrong', 'out', 'Lisa', 'BIG', 'FAKER', 'admitting', 'mother', 'Claudette', 'Carolyn', 'Minnot', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', ""n't"", 'love', 'Johnny', 'anymore', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'anymore', 'Lisa', 'mother', 'Claudette', 'Lisa', 'Johnny', 'good', 'man', 'trust', 'THIS', ""n't"", 'last', 'time', 'will', 'hear', 'line', '.After', 'Claudette', 'Lisa', 'Mark', 'Greg', 'Sestero', 'who', 'Johnny', 'best', 'friend', 'talk', 'Eventually', 'things', 'get', 'hot', 'heavy', 'apartment', 'Lisa', 'Mark', 'Lisa', 'Mark', 'not', 'Johnny.Of', 'course', 'Lisa', 'being', 'BIG', 'FAKE', 'trick', 'Johnny', 'Lisa', 'Johnny', 'get', 'drunk', 'up', 'story', 'hit', 'was', 'drunk.Eventually', 'Johnny', 'put', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'very', 'end.So', 'what', 'movie', 'SO', 'BAD', 'yet', 'ENTERTAINING', 'Here', 'are', 'more', 'couple', 'reasons', 'First', 'THE', 'BAD:1', 'Tommy', 'Wiseau', 'acting', 'Wow', 'where', 'do', 'start', 'one', 'acting', 'JUST', 'HORRIBLE', 'perfect', 'honestly', 'have', 'seen', 'BETTER', 'acting', 'elementary', 'school', 'performances', 'what', 'Tommy', 'Wiseau', 'put', 'movie', 'first', 'scene', 'as', 'soon', 'shot', 'opening', 'line', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'playing', 'mental', 'patient.2', 'subplots', 'Now', 'thing', 'subplots', 'are', 'supposed', 'add', 'story', 'also', 'characters', 'interesting', 'how', 'characters', 'deal', 'issue', 'hand', 'Well', 'are', 'several', 'subplots', 'movie', 'are', 'quickly', 'added', 'five', 'minutes', 'are', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'neighborhood', 'kid', 'Denny', 'Phillip', 'Haldiman', 'who', 'mysterious', 'run-in', 'drug', 'dealer', 'attraction', 'Lisa.Claudette', 'Lisa', 'mother', 'deals', 'real', 'estate', 'problems', 'failed', 'relationships', 'breast', 'cancer', 'once', 'mentioned', 'quickly', 'forgotten.3', 'lot', 'questions', 'are', 'arisen', 'never', 'answered', 'Denny', 'telling', 'Lisa', 'brought', 'drugs', 'mysterious', 'drug', 'dealer', 'money', 'never', 'what', 'kind', 'drugs', 'bought', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'drug', 'dealer', 'drug', 'dealer', 'gone', 'never', 'back', 'bothers', 'Denny', 'again.Claudette', 'telling', 'Lisa', 'HER', 'DAUGHTER', 'breast', 'cancer', 'Lisa', 'mother', 'Everything', 'going', 'be', 'right', 'what', 'happened', 'Did', 'Claudette', 'seek', 'medical', 'help', 'breast', 'cancer', 'Again', 'brought', 'up', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'college', 'not', 'clear', 'talked', 'Denny', 'fully-functioning', 'adult', 'character', 'quite', 'ignorant', 'social', 'standards', 'when', 'Johnny', 'Lisa', 'go', 'upstairs', 'make', 'love', 'Denny', 'up', 'bedroom', 'throwing', 'pillows', 'Johnny', 'Lisa', 'what', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'little', 'strange.Now', 'may', 'be', 'wondering', 'have', 'bashed', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'what', 'so', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Well', 'let', 'explain:1', 'script', 'Yes', 'are', 'repeated', 'lines', 'movie', 'i.e', 'Johnny', 'good', 'man', 'Johnny', 'best', 'friend', '..etc', 'one', 'scene', 'Johnny', 'Mark', 'roof', 'where', 'Johnny', 'up', 'phone', 'Lisa', 'lie', 'hitting', 'priceless.2', 'acting', 'Tommy', 'Wiseau', 'talks', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'playing', 'mental', 'patient', 'acting', 'camera', 'so', 'FUNNY', 'lines', 'say', 'movie', 'are', 'outright', 'HILARIOUS', 'sometimes', 'just', 'outright', 'STRANGE.Tommy', 'Wiseau', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'bad', 'acting', 'most', 'not', 'actors', 'have', 'hooky', 'acting', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Tommy', 'Wiseau', 'So', 'are', 'movies', 'are', 'terrible-but-good', 'same', 'time', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'Room']",The Room

The writing is fascinatingly atrocious, the acting is unintentionally hilarious, and the overall movie has a real sense of wanting to be taken seriously and completely does not work in that regard. I can absolutely understand why people would enjoy this for how bad it is.However, I cannot enjoy watching a ""so-bad-it's-good"" movie, however. I never have and I never will.Here's why.Mr. Wiseau appears to have embraced how bad everyone believes his movie to be, and even shows up at screenings at what has been called ""one of the best worst movies ever"". If it was me,however, I would be horrified that my passion project had been perverted in such a way when I had spent so much time and money trying to get the film made. The fact that he is all for making fun of it genuinely makes me wonder if he was in fact TRYING to make the film not work on purpose. This is a sentiment that applies much more to abominations like Birdemic and The Amazing Bulk, but the idea remains the same.You look at any scene in The Room, and any person with half a lick of common sense would say to themselves ""you know, this is pretty darn bad."" From there, you would then think either ""I should re-shoot/rewrite this to make it better and not waste the money I've invested in this"", or ""Maybe if I make this as bad as I can, I can have a Troll 2 movie on my hands!!"" Seriously though, did Wiseau look at this and genuinely think this was a well-made and told story? I can't believe that; I really can't.As such, while I understand the appeal of these types of movis, it is not a sentiment that I can agree with. I can't enjoy this movie because of how bad it is; I can only watch it all the way through just to say I finished it, return it to the person I borrowed it from, and never think about it again.

958761,A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ,B000CFYAMC,Zoe Paris,"[11, 12]","This is a GEM when it comes to horrible movies! I have heard this compared to 'Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and while 'The Room' might have a similar cult following there is one huge difference...Rocky Horror was SUPPOSED to be a bizarre, freaky, cheesy and badly made comedy...Where as 'The Room' it appears that Tommy Wiseau put all his heart, soul and money into making a brilliant drama and instead ended up with one bizarre, freaky, cheesy and frighteningly bad movie...AND IT'S HILARIOUS!I will warn you though...Unless you are a fan of bad movies, don't watch this! Only watch this if you have a good sense of humor and you enjoy shouting creative insults at the screen. Otherwise you'll probably consider this movie really boring and a waste of time. The best way to watch this is drunk in a big group of obnoxious, loud people! If you watch it alone, I suggest playing the Rifftrax that goes with it. This makes it a lot funnier when alone or in a group.So what's the movie about? It's about Johnny (played by Wiseau) a scraggly-haired, pale, scary looking banker with an unknown strange accent. We are supposed to believe Johnny is a ""normal"" guy, very in love with his future wife Lisa. We see him shower Lisa with gifts and we see a blindingly scary and loooooong love scene...then for whatever reason, Lisa decides to sleep with Johnny's best friend Mark. Things just get more muddled after this and after a while you don't even care about the plot because you are too busy marveling over this train wreck! There are lots of other pointless sub-plots that you would expect to go somewhere but they don't. I won't spoil the ending (though I doubt 'spoiling' this movie is possible) but I will say that it leaves you with more questions than answers.First off, why does Lisa have really thick, dark eyebrows and bleached out hair? Why are all these guys making a fuss and going on about her 'beauty' when she isn't even hot? Why is Johnny's suit so lumpy looking? Is it because of his wiry, leathery, lumpy and unattractively muscled body (the show it several times and in the nude scenes, in fact everyone in this seems to have a weird looking body) that he obviously thinks is attractive? Why are the characters playing football in such close proximity while wearing tuxedos? Why is the dialogue so unnatural sounding? What has more holes, the plot or Swiss cheese? What is wrong with Denny? Why does nearly every scene begin with someone saying ""Oh Hi So-and-so""? Who is the random, uninvited couple doing stuff in another couple's living room? Why are there framed photos of spoons decorating Johnny and Lisa's home? Where is this Room? Why did they use a really fake looking (and probably expensive) green screen to look like a smoggy version of San Francisco during the roof scenes? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to rent a rooftop in Los Angeles to create an ugly, smoggy skyline? How many drugs were consumed during the making of this film? And finally, WHY GOD WHY does Lisa mix Scotch and Vodka together?The world may never know the answers and maybe that it part of the appeal of this movie. How and why something so awful could ever be created is nothing short of a miracle. Call it a fluke, call it horrible, call it brilliant but one thing is for certain: Badness of this epic proportion only happens once in a lifetime. Normally bad movies fade into obscurity and end up on the 50% rack at a dollar store but for whatever reason, this movie has captured the hearts and induced the nausea of millions of people...And that's just COOL!One final note to anyone with the bright idea of making a ""Scotchka"" drink like in the movie. DON'T! It's a bad, bad idea people! If you can actually get past the taste, it can make a person very ill, especially if you drink it during the love scenes in this movie...Be warned!",5,"If you hate my review you can ""Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!""",1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,3833,"['GEM', 'when', 'horrible', 'movies', 'have', 'heard', 'compared', ""'Rocky"", 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', ""'The"", 'Room', 'might', 'have', 'similar', 'cult', 'following', 'one', 'huge', 'difference', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'was', 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'bizarre', 'freaky', 'cheesy', 'badly', 'made', 'comedy', 'Where', ""'The"", 'Room', 'Tommy', 'Wiseau', 'put', 'heart', 'soul', 'money', 'making', 'brilliant', 'drama', 'instead', 'ended', 'up', 'one', 'bizarre', 'freaky', 'cheesy', 'frighteningly', 'bad', 'movie', 'IT', 'HILARIOUS', 'will', 'warn', 'are', 'fan', 'bad', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Only', 'watch', 'have', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'enjoy', 'shouting', 'creative', 'insults', 'screen', 'Otherwise', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'consider', 'movie', 'really', 'boring', 'waste', 'time', 'best', 'way', 'watch', 'drunk', 'big', 'group', 'obnoxious', 'loud', 'people', 'watch', 'alone', 'suggest', 'playing', 'Rifftrax', 'lot', 'funnier', 'when', 'alone', 'group.So', 'what', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'played', 'Wiseau', 'scraggly-haired', 'pale', 'scary', 'looking', 'banker', 'unknown', 'strange', 'accent', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'Johnny', 'normal', 'guy', 'very', 'love', 'future', 'wife', 'Lisa', 'see', 'shower', 'Lisa', 'gifts', 'see', 'blindingly', 'scary', 'loooooong', 'love', 'scene', 'then', 'reason', 'Lisa', 'sleep', 'Johnny', 'best', 'friend', 'Mark', 'Things', 'just', 'get', 'more', 'muddled', 'while', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'plot', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'marveling', 'train', 'wreck', 'are', 'lots', 'other', 'pointless', 'sub-plots', 'would', 'expect', 'go', 'somewhere', 'do', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'doubt', ""'spoiling"", 'movie', 'possible', 'will', 'say', 'more', 'questions', 'answers.First', 'why', 'Lisa', 'have', 'really', 'thick', 'dark', 'eyebrows', 'bleached', 'out', 'hair', 'Why', 'are', 'guys', 'making', 'fuss', 'going', ""'beauty"", 'when', ""n't"", 'even', 'hot', 'Why', 'Johnny', 'suit', 'so', 'lumpy', 'looking', 'wiry', 'leathery', 'lumpy', 'unattractively', 'muscled', 'body', 'show', 'several', 'times', 'nude', 'scenes', 'fact', 'everyone', 'have', 'weird', 'looking', 'body', 'obviously', 'attractive', 'Why', 'are', 'characters', 'playing', 'football', 'such', 'close', 'proximity', 'wearing', 'tuxedos', 'Why', 'dialogue', 'so', 'unnatural', 'sounding', 'What', 'more', 'holes', 'plot', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'What', 'wrong', 'Denny', 'Why', 'nearly', 'scene', 'begin', 'someone', 'saying', 'Oh', 'Hi', 'So-and-so', 'Who', 'random', 'uninvited', 'couple', 'doing', 'stuff', 'couple', 'living', 'room', 'Why', 'are', 'there', 'framed', 'photos', 'spoons', 'decorating', 'Johnny', 'Lisa', 'home', 'Where', 'Room', 'Why', 'did', 'use', 'really', 'fake', 'looking', 'probably', 'expensive', 'green', 'screen', 'look', 'smoggy', 'version', 'San', 'Francisco', 'roof', 'scenes', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'cheaper', 'rent', 'rooftop', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'create', 'ugly', 'smoggy', 'skyline', 'How', 'many', 'drugs', 'were', 'consumed', 'making', 'film', 'finally', 'WHY', 'GOD', 'WHY', 'Lisa', 'mix', 'Scotch', 'Vodka', 'together', 'world', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'answers', 'maybe', 'part', 'appeal', 'movie', 'How', 'why', 'something', 'so', 'awful', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'created', 'nothing', 'short', 'miracle', 'Call', 'fluke', 'call', 'horrible', 'call', 'brilliant', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'Badness', 'epic', 'proportion', 'only', 'once', 'lifetime', 'Normally', 'bad', 'movies', 'fade', 'obscurity', 'end', 'up', '50', '%', 'rack', 'dollar', 'store', 'reason', 'movie', 'captured', 'hearts', 'induced', 'nausea', 'millions', 'people', 'just', 'COOL', 'One', 'final', 'note', 'anyone', 'bright', 'idea', 'making', 'Scotchka', 'drink', 'movie', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'bad', 'bad', 'idea', 'people', 'can', 'actually', 'get', 'taste', 'can', 'make', 'person', 'very', 'ill', 'especially', 'drink', 'love', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Be', 'warned']",The Room
