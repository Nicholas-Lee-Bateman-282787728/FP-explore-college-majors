These movies collected here are suppose to be cult classics, but I don't know what all the fuss is about. These movies aren't really that entertaining, but I think there's some formula to a nurse movie. Which sort of make all these movies similar, since they're all nurse movies. I learned nudity was a prerequisite, and that was the main reason I bought these movies, hoping to see young nurses nude. But I think the movies are a keeper.",3,I'm Not Sure What Makes A Nurse Movie,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,528,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'nurse', 'movie', 'genre', 'only', 'something', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'movies', 'collected', 'here', 'are', 'suppose', 'be', 'cult', 'classics', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'fuss', 'about', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'entertaining', 'think', 'formula', 'nurse', 'movie', 'Which', 'sort', 'make', 'movies', 'similar', ""'re"", 'nurse', 'movies', 'learned', 'nudity', 'was', 'prerequisite', 'was', 'main', 'reason', 'bought', 'movies', 'hoping', 'see', 'young', 'nurses', 'nude', 'think', 'movies', 'are', 'keeper']","Roger Corman's Cult Classics: The Nurses Collection (Candy Stripe Nurses, Private Duty Nurses, Night Call Nurses, Young Nurses)"

1520077,AC1UOIA4ERNS4,B006UKX6GO,"Monty Britton ""crazy about movies""","[52, 62]","Have been a fan of exploitation film from the '70s for many years (my fav being The Women in Prison flicks) and was thinking upon hearing of this release that I have died and gone to drive-in heaven! These four nurse films are classics of exploitation in my book. This two DVD set has two films per disc in anamorphic widescreen for the first time! The only down side to this set (which is why I gave it four stars) is the lack of special features. There are two. That is it! One is an interview with Roger and Julie Corman (the best special feature I have seen in years) and the other is with the two directors of Night Call Nurses and Candy Stripe Nurses (it is cool to see Jonathan Kaplan remember making his flick). With the status of these four classic films where are the trailers!? And I would love to hear Jonathan Kaplan for eighty minutes talking about his bout with exploitation cinema. But NO ONE can look or sound as excited as the great Roger Corman! Man, I could listen to him talk for days about his cheap filmmaking techniques.I am VERY disappointed that Stephanie Rothman's (one great female director under the Corman belt) The Student Nurses was not included with this set. Preferred to have ALL the nurse films in one set! But that one quibble aside, this still is great to have if you are a fan of sleazy drive-in fare from the '70s. These are great looking transfers that are bright and colorful compared to the terrible DVD releases from the past.Now the question lies, Where are The Teacher films at? Come on, you got me hungry for more... The Student Teachers and Summer School Teachers I know need the love and care these Nurse films got. One can only cross his fingers and hope that they too (along with Student Nurses) gets a DVD release in the future.More reason to love Shout and the great work they keep giving us fans!",4,This is one nice package!!
