The animation is great,  the writing is good -- my favorite part was probably near the beginning  when the co-heroes are expecting life to end at any minute and they are  reflecting on how they thought it would all end...great stuff.The  music is good, but doesn't overpower or overshadow the movie.  Character  development is better than in the animated shows I've seen since  &quot;Mulan&quot; and, interestingly, the main protagonist and antagonist  are not the main characters.  They are the village chief and the local high  priest and all around creepy guy.Development of the story throughout the  show is good, there are few slow parts, and many enjoyable action parts. I  particularly enjoyed the &quot;soccer game&quot; played in an arena like  those found among ancient central American ruins.The whole experience  was somewhat reminiscent of &quot;The Man Who Would be King&quot; starring  Sean Connery and Michael Caine, though not as graphic -- tooled down for  the animated crowd to watch.All in all, well worth the ticket price.A  sound show with action, music, and story that will hold the attention of  adult and child alike.5 stars.Alan Holyoak",5,"Better than Disney's Tarzan, on par with Mulan",959040000,"05 23, 2000",2000,1285,"['saw', 'film', 'twice', 'family', 'wife', 'three', 'older', 'children', '10', '8', '6', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'animation', 'great', 'writing', 'good', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'probably', 'beginning', 'when', 'co-heroes', 'are', 'expecting', 'life', 'end', 'minute', 'are', 'reflecting', 'how', 'thought', 'would', 'end', 'great', 'stuff.The', 'music', 'good', ""n't"", 'overpower', 'overshadow', 'movie', 'Character', 'development', 'better', 'animated', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quot', 'Mulan', 'quot', 'interestingly', 'main', 'protagonist', 'antagonist', 'are', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'village', 'chief', 'local', 'high', 'priest', 'creepy', 'guy.Development', 'story', 'show', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'slow', 'parts', 'many', 'enjoyable', 'action', 'parts', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'game', 'quot', 'played', 'arena', 'found', 'ancient', 'central', 'American', 'ruins.The', 'whole', 'experience', 'was', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'quot', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'be', 'King', 'quot', 'starring', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'though', 'not', 'graphic', 'tooled', 'down', 'animated', 'crowd', 'watch.All', 'well', 'ticket', 'price.A', 'sound', 'show', 'action', 'music', 'story', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'adult', 'child', 'alike.5', 'stars.Alan', 'Holyoak']",N/A

524394,A32Y55Z00QI12S,B00003CXG6,ARK,"[1, 1]","This film is incredibly fun.  The over-the-top expressions and gestures, the striking character designs, the bright colors, the lovable characters, and the fabulous voice actors weave a fantastic tale that never drops interest for a moment.What separates this movie from the pack is its snappy dialogue, which flows effortlessly and brings a laugh a minute.  The excellent voice acting, combined with the overly dramatic gestures and sharp facial expressions, bring the characters to life in a way that I have seen very rarely before.The plot is a lot of fun, too.  It surrounds a rarely-touched myth and culture (refreshing!).  Furthermore, who hasn't dreamt of finding a treasure map, and what would be more fun than being thought of as a god by an unwitting culture?  I especially like the angle Dreamworks took with this by using a couple of gangly, worldly cons as its protagonists rather than doe-eyed kids or macho explorers.There are some minor flaws in this film.  For one thing, this rosy image of South American natives and demonization of Spanish colonialism is so politically correct it's sickening.  However, it's easy to overlook; just remember to keep history at arm's length and remember that this is entertainment -- a realm where the film excels.Another negative thing is the over-dependence on really blah songs by Elton John.  I mean, BLAH.  The animators did what they could with it -- excellent jobs, even.  However, it takes two to tango; the animation never completely meshes with the boring songs (which all sound completely the same), and the fact that you can feel boredom setting in in the first five seconds of each tune is a bad, bad sign.  The animation does pick it up, but it carries most of the load.  You'll be waiting for the songs to end so that the plot can continue.Although all of the characters are fantastic, one manages to leap into the film and smudge the whole affair.  Chel is well-animated and has a great voice, but the character herself is downright disgusting.  She is a smug, oversexed trollop, crawling all over one of the protagonists in a way that'll be hard to explain to the little 'uns.  At one point she's saying goodbye to all the children of her town, and I can almost imagine the subtext: ""Chel says farewell to her illegitimate kids.""  She is almost never likable -- if she's not blackmailing the protagonists, she's purposely trying to part them.Also, although it is billed as kid's fare, there are some really intense parts in this movie.  Parents should be aware that a guy is sacrificed at one point (kicked into a vat of glowing green potion), a man is stepped on by a gargantuan statue, and the High Priest is a frightening, nigh demonic foe with some pretty creepy powers.These are not reasons to turn away from this film, however.  The plot is fun, the characters are 99% great, there's one catchy song in the middle, there are adorable animal sidekicks in the way of an armadillo and a horse, and the animation and voice acting is fabulous.  All the good points outweigh the bad with ease.

This movie is nice, I liked it, but it is not a masterpiece by any means.The two main characters and the horse are very funny, very realistic -- but for our times. I'm not sure there were people like that in Cortes' time. But you have to ignore these kind of mistakes -- like you have to ignore the impossibility of Tulio and Miguel speaking the same language as the people of El Dorado -- otherwise how did they understand each other?I especially enjoyed the fact that there was no character exclusively in the movie to provide the kind of 'comic relief' of Mushu in Mulan. The humor was natural, not forced, it came directly from the situations and the dialogue.The music was not remarkable and did not fit in with the action very good. Also, I absolutely dislike Rosie Perez and her accent was very, very, very annoying. Also, I did not like the ending -- without giving it away I will just say I would have preferred if they did what Miguel wanted to do.I didn't mind the so-called nudity -- there was really no nudity and the love scene was just suggested, a young kid would not get the point at all.In my book, this film stays on a par with &quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot;.

A few years ago, there was no sign of it on video or DVD (and as far as I know, there still isn't), but a fan site did mention there was a DreamWorks animation coming out in cinemas called ""Road to El Dorado"", featuring two Spanish guys exploring a mysterious city... of gold! The similarities end there though, and this film is still pretty entertaining.Tulio and Miguel are best friends, who live by their wits in the streets of Spain. They win a map to El Dorado, the famous New World city of gold, in a game of dice. Unfortunately, their opponents discover their dice are loaded, and in the duo's escape, they get caught on Hernando Cortez' ship bound for Mexico. (Don  They are caught, then escape with a boat and a horse, and after many days in shark infested waters, run aground at exactly the place where the map begins. They discover El Dorado, and it's people mistake the two men on a horse for two of their gods, and pay tribute to them. The two men decide to take advantage of this misunderstanding and ask for gold and a ship to get home. But curiousity, a beautiful Mayan woman, and a bloodthirsty priest undo all their deception, and they are caught out several times. Will they make it out of El Dorado with their lives, or will the people allow them to stay?The two best things about this film, I think, are the colourful design of the New World and the banter between Tulio and Miguel (played by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh). They seem to be having a lot of fun in their roles, and though some of the dialogue is modern sounding, it's not cluttered with cheesy cultural references like some more recent animated features. Jim Cummings (the voice of Winnie the Pooh and Darkwing Duck) does the voice of Cortez, and though the tone of his words are all too familiar if you've watched his cartoons, he does a good job at capturing the bitterness and the greed of the man. The music, by Elton John, Tim Rice and Hans Zimmer is pleasant enough too.Special features on the DVD include a director's commentary with Eric Begerson and Don Paul, a fairly interesting making of documentary, a behind-the-animation montage, narrated by the crew, the original theatrical trailer, and Elton John music video, in which you see the singer animated. He looks very peaceful as a cartoon...Worth a look for fans of adventure.",4,The Other City of Gold,1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,2508,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'old', '1980s', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Mysterious', 'Cities', 'Gold', 'series', 'couple', 'Spanish', 'kids', 'exploring', 'New', 'World', 'discovering', 'many', 'strange', 'things', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'sign', 'video', 'DVD', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'still', ""n't"", 'fan', 'site', 'did', 'mention', 'was', 'DreamWorks', 'animation', 'coming', 'out', 'cinemas', 'called', 'Road', 'El', 'Dorado', 'featuring', 'two', 'Spanish', 'guys', 'exploring', 'mysterious', 'city', 'gold', 'similarities', 'end', 'there', 'film', 'still', 'pretty', 'entertaining.Tulio', 'Miguel', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'live', 'wits', 'streets', 'Spain', 'win', 'map', 'El', 'Dorado', 'famous', 'New', 'World', 'city', 'gold', 'game', 'dice', 'Unfortunately', 'opponents', 'discover', 'dice', 'are', 'loaded', 'duo', 'escape', 'get', 'caught', 'Hernando', 'Cortez', 'ship', 'bound', 'Mexico', 'are', 'caught', 'then', 'escape', 'boat', 'horse', 'many', 'days', 'shark', 'infested', 'waters', 'run', 'aground', 'exactly', 'place', 'where', 'map', 'discover', 'El', 'Dorado', 'people', 'mistake', 'two', 'men', 'horse', 'two', 'gods', 'pay', 'tribute', 'two', 'men', 'decide', 'take', 'advantage', 'misunderstanding', 'ask', 'gold', 'ship', 'get', 'home', 'curiousity', 'beautiful', 'Mayan', 'woman', 'bloodthirsty', 'priest', 'deception', 'are', 'caught', 'out', 'several', 'times', 'Will', 'make', 'El', 'Dorado', 'lives', 'will', 'people', 'allow', 'stay', 'two', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'think', 'are', 'colourful', 'design', 'New', 'World', 'banter', 'Tulio', 'Miguel', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'lot', 'fun', 'roles', 'dialogue', 'modern', 'sounding', 'not', 'cluttered', 'cheesy', 'cultural', 'references', 'more', 'recent', 'animated', 'features', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'voice', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Darkwing', 'Duck', 'voice', 'Cortez', 'tone', 'words', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'cartoons', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'bitterness', 'greed', 'man', 'music', 'Elton', 'John', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'too.Special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'director', 'commentary', 'Eric', 'Begerson', 'Don', 'Paul', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'making', 'documentary', 'behind-the-animation', 'montage', 'narrated', 'crew', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Elton', 'John', 'music', 'video', 'see', 'singer', 'animated', 'very', 'peaceful', 'cartoon', 'look', 'fans', 'adventure']",N/A

524436,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00003CXG6,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","""The Road to El Dorado"" tends to get a bad rap as the film that helped kill DreamWorks' 2D animation projects -- I believe the lackluster and even more forgettable ""Sinbad"" was their only other 2D film after this one tanked in theaters.  It didn't find much of an audience and sank quietly out of sight afterwards, and ever since then DreamWorks seems content to forget it existed and instead focus on their cash-cow franchises of ""Madagascar,"" ""Shrek,"" ""Kung Fu Panda,"" and more recently ""How To Train Your Dragon.""  Nothing against any of these movies (well, except maybe ""Madagascar""), but as much as I love certain 3D animated features I do miss the look and feel of classic 2D animation, and DreamWorks' distinct visual style with such movies was fun to look at and provided a nice counterpoint to Disney's occasionally over-stylized look.  Alas, the only memorable film to come out of their 2D animated studio seems to be ""The Prince of Egypt,"" and even it has been mostly forgotten since then.While not quite as good as their animated Biblical epic ""The Prince of Egypt,"" ""The Road to El Dorado"" bears the distinction of being a heck of a lot more fun.  It has no pretentions of being serious and instead focuses on telling a fun buddy-adventure story, and serves as a sort of tribute to the Hope-Crosby buddy-adventure films (with even the title being a shout-out to them).The film follows Miguel and Tulio, two unlucky con men trying to scrape a living in seventeenth-century Spain.  Miguel is the perpetual optimist, and when a map to the legendary golden city of El Dorado falls into their hands during a dice game he tries to convince his partner-in-crime to embark on the adventure of a lifetime.  The greedier, more cynical Tulio is understandably skeptical, but when circumstances land them as stowaways on Cortez's ship to the New World, they end up taking said adventure anyhow.  Accompanied by Cortez's bright, long-suffering horse Altivo, the two end up beating Cortez to the New World and stumbling upon the legendary city, where they are promptly mistaken for gods.  At first they decide to milk the deception for wealth and prestige, but when a power-hungry mad priest tries to manipulate their presence for his own gain -- and the bloodthirsty Cortez makes landfall -- the duo has to decide whether to take their newfound riches and run, or protect the citizens of El Dorado from threats within and without.The animation of this film is a mixed bag.  The 2D animation is slick and stylish, but not overly so, balancing detail with style quite well.  And the look of El Dorado itself is quite visually pleasing, a unique blend of several different South American cultures (mostly Mayan and Aztec, though there's a bit of Olmec to be found as well).  The 2D and 3D elements don't blend well, unfortunately, and it's quite easy to tell where traditional animation ends and CGI begins.  This is most blatant in the ocean scenes and during the morning ceremony where the chief presents Miguel and Tulio with some rather conspicuously CGI gold.  Other films have proven that it's possible to combine 2D and 3D animation without making it blatant (""The Iron Giant"" and ""Treasure Planet"" are two good examples), so why they didn't try harder to meld these elements is beyond me.The film itself is quite enjoyable, though.  Miguel and Tulio are hilarious, their banter providing much of the humor and their friendship and conflicts driving most of the plot.  The entire film, while based on historical events, is more a tribute to the old buddy-adventure films than a factual account, and eschews realism for light fantasy at points (the priest is actually able to bring a stone statue to life, for example).  The characters' decisions and struggles through the movie feel realistic and never forced, and their interactions with both Cortez and the natives of El Dorado feel believable.  The other characters are mostly minor, but the chief is a likable character, and the mad priest is a deliciously over-the-top villain quite in contrast with Cortez's more icy-cold demeanor.  And Altivo, despite not being a talking animal, provides many of the films funniest scenes, and gets quite a bit of his exasperation and bewilderment at their predicaments across via facial expressions.The film is surprisingly at its weakest when it introduced a third member to the party -- Chel, a native to El Dorado with scoundrel tendencies of her own.  She mostly exists as scantily-clad eye candy, throwing the occasional snarky comment at the main characters, and at one point even tries to drive them apart for her own gain.  I feel the film could have been improved by leaving her out -- there were better ways to cause friction between the main characters than the tired ""romantic subplot"" angle.Also a warning to parents -- this is a PG-rated movie, and it certainly earns that rating with spooky scenes, occasional nudity (always shown from the back, though), some suggested sensual scenes, and even the occasional swear word.  Parents might want to screen this movie before showing it to children, especially young ones.One last thing -- this film contains a number of songs by Elton John, and all but one of these songs are performed by the singer.  I personally enjoyed them and thought they added to the sense of fun and wonder the film had, but your mileage may vary.All in all, while not a masterpiece, ""The Road to El Dorado"" was a fun and often hilarious adventure story, and one of the better 2D-animated DreamWorks films.  I'm rather disappointed that it's failure at the box office killed plans for a series, and hope that someday DreamWorks revives the idea and gives us more adventures of Miguel and Tulio.

It's full of adventure that every young boy enjoys to watch.  Unfortunately, I'm almost thirty, and the real reason I bought this flick was for my four-year-old daughter to enjoy.  She liked it well enough, but it has many themes in it that are a little bit over her young head.  Also, there are a couple of words in it(hell and crap), that some parents may not want their youngsters hearing.That being said, this is a great film for older children to watch.  Much like ""Atlantis:  The Lost Empire,"" ""El Dorado"" has plenty of action and even a little suspense that will definitely trigger the imaginations of youngsters who dream of being pirates, Indiana Jones, treasure hunters, etc.The story begins with Miguel and Tulio, two generally low-brow scalawags trying to cheat their way to riches in a game of dice.  They gain a map in their victory but are quickly found out to be cheats.  They hide in barrels in order to get away from the authorities and those that they had cheated, but are placed on a ship headed for the New World.  They manage to escape at sea and find themselves beached at El Dorado, the legendary city of gold.  They are mistaken for gods and are treated as such.  Along the way, they stockpile as many of the natives' riches that they can, but in the end, they must make a huge moral decision that leads to a swashbuckling conclusion.With the voice talents of Kevin Kline, Rosie Perez, Edward James Olmos, and the wonderful Kenneth Branagh, ""The Road To El Dorado"" is essentially a buddy flick for the younger crowd, though this oldster found himself enjoying this film quite a bit.  The music, by Elton John and Tim Rice, is ultimately forgettable, but the score, by Hans Zimmer, is much more memorable.Pick this flick up for your older kids.  Younger children may not catch the bulk of the humor in this film, but the comedy provided by Altivo, a horse, is sure to get some laughs out of them.Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys adventure films like all of the Indiana Jones flicks and even ""The Goonies.""",4,Wonderful Adventure Tale,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,2088,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Road', 'El', 'Dorado', 'full', 'adventure', 'young', 'boy', 'watch', 'Unfortunately', ""'m"", 'almost', 'thirty', 'real', 'reason', 'bought', 'flick', 'was', 'four-year-old', 'daughter', 'enjoy', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'many', 'themes', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'young', 'head', 'Also', 'are', 'couple', 'words', 'hell', 'crap', 'parents', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'youngsters', 'hearing.That', 'being', 'said', 'great', 'film', 'older', 'children', 'watch', 'Much', 'Atlantis', 'Lost', 'Empire', 'El', 'Dorado', 'plenty', 'action', 'even', 'little', 'suspense', 'will', 'definitely', 'trigger', 'imaginations', 'youngsters', 'who', 'dream', 'being', 'pirates', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'treasure', 'hunters', 'etc.The', 'story', 'Miguel', 'Tulio', 'two', 'generally', 'low-brow', 'scalawags', 'trying', 'cheat', 'way', 'riches', 'game', 'dice', 'gain', 'map', 'victory', 'are', 'quickly', 'found', 'out', 'be', 'cheats', 'hide', 'barrels', 'order', 'get', 'away', 'authorities', 'had', 'cheated', 'are', 'placed', 'ship', 'headed', 'New', 'World', 'manage', 'escape', 'sea', 'find', 'beached', 'El', 'Dorado', 'legendary', 'city', 'gold', 'are', 'mistaken', 'gods', 'are', 'treated', 'such', 'way', 'stockpile', 'many', 'natives', 'riches', 'can', 'end', 'must', 'make', 'huge', 'moral', 'decision', 'swashbuckling', 'conclusion.With', 'voice', 'talents', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'wonderful', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Road', 'El', 'Dorado', 'essentially', 'buddy', 'flick', 'younger', 'crowd', 'oldster', 'found', 'enjoying', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'music', 'Elton', 'John', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'ultimately', 'forgettable', 'score', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'much', 'more', 'memorable.Pick', 'up', 'older', 'kids', 'Younger', 'children', 'may', 'not', 'catch', 'bulk', 'humor', 'film', 'comedy', 'provided', 'Altivo', 'horse', 'sure', 'get', 'laughs', 'them.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'adventure', 'films', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'flicks', 'even', 'Goonies']",N/A

It has chemistry in the characters and visuals that stunning and amazing in their color and detail. Directed by Bibo Bergeron (A Goofy Movie, Ferngully: The Last Rainforest) and Will Finn (Beauty &amp; The Beast, Aladdin) it tells the story of two not-so popular con artists that inadvertently get themselves on a quest that turns into a real adventure.Kevin Klein (Life Is A House, In &amp; Out, Wild, Wild West) and Kenneth Branagh (Harry Potter, Wild, Wild, West) play Tulio and Miguel who are friends for life and have an uncanny knack for theatrics, conning and being rogues of there own worlds no matter where they end up. The are funny and witty and always seem to be at each other's throats. Together they are a force to be reckoned with however separate they probably could tie their own shoes without help. They acquire a map and decide to find the gold of El Dorado.El Dorado is the adventure they seek having had acquired a map through a fantastic scheme and theatrical conning. Once on their journey they acquire and incredibly independent horse. (Sometimes this horse is brighter then them!) Through an accident, they end up on the ship of Cortez voiced by Jim Cummings (Shrek, Winnie The Pooh) who takes them to the shore where El Dorado is.Finding the city of gold itself they meet an ancient people who is lead by a Chief voiced by Edward James Olmos (Battlestar Galactica, Stand &amp; Deliver, Selena) and indirectly guided by his daughter Chel who is voiced by Rosie Perez (Fearless, Riding In Cars With Boys). There is also the bad guy voiced Armand Assante (Gotti, On The Beach) who is making things difficult and dangerous for the boys.This is a fun and fantastic film and the best part is that there are 6 original songs written by Tim Rice and Elton John and performed by Elton himself. The score by Hans Zimmer is upbeat and fun and with music like this you can't go wrong. (This is the same musical team that came up with the musical scores and compositions for The Lion King!)

524447,A15TIGL6MKUWYU,B00003CXG6,"Mark E. Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[1, 1]","The Road To El Dorado is a buddy movie, wherein two con men, after winning the map to the famed golden city of El Dorado in a dice game, find themselves thrust into the greatest adventure of their lives.  This, of course, is a very quick synopsis of the movie, but I don't really want to give too much of the movie away because the journey in this case is the whole purpose of the movie.Animated movies, as a rule, depend on one major thing, besides a decent script, and that is the voice overs for the characters.  If you can't believe in the voices, if they don't really seem to fit the characters, then no matter how good the movie is, you just can't really seem to get too deeply involved in it.  Happily, in this case, Tulio, voiced by Kevin Klein, and Miguel, voiced by Kenneth Branagh, are a joy to listen to, and they fit their characters perfectly.  Listening to the two of them banter together during the course of the film, you can really believe that these two men have known each other for a long time, and are really the best of friends.  Rosie Perez as Chel, Armande Assante as Tzekel-Kan, and Edward James Olmos as the Chief also do very good jobs, making the movie a joy to watch.In any other animated production, you could envision Tulio and Miguel as the sidekicks of the main hero, the comic relief to keep the picture from getting too serious.  In this case, they themselves are the main heroes of the movie, and it's a real pleasure to see the two quick thinking, quick talking scam artists as the heroes of the picture.  Although they are constantly trying to steal the gold from El Dorado, when it comes right down to it, they always end up doing the right thing.The two funniest moments of the movie happen early in the picture.  One is right after it is discovered that they were playing with loaded dice, and are about to be arrested.  The two of them stage a faked duel as a means of escaping the guards, and the men they were playing dice with.  The second scene is after they've made their escape from the ship in a rowboat, and find themselves drifting with no food, and no land anywhere in sight.  After drifting for a long time, they are heartened to see a bird land on their oar, until it falls over dead, apparently from exhaustion.  Then, as they are about to eat the bird and at least escape starvation, a shark leaps up from below, and snatches the bird from their grasp.

It was humorous, intelligent, and  action-packed, with some of the finest animation Dreamworks Studios has to  offer.  I wasn't bored for a single second, and I even went back to the  theatre to see it a second time.  I thought the music was catchy,  interesting, original and fun, and really suited the feel of the movie.  Elton John writes perfectly wonderful music and Tim Rice is a great  lyricist.  There were two things I liked in particular.  First, that  the heroine Chel isn't a slender willow wand of a girl-a popular heroine  depiction that encourages anorexia and bulemia at an early age.  There's  nothing sadder than a perfectly healthy seven year old girl who's &quot;on  a diet&quot;.  I know.  I've seen it.  Chel is hippy and voluptuous with  plenty of meat on her bones in a very Frazetta-style fashion-and she's also  very attractive.  What a way to insinuate that a girl can be sexy without  being under one hundred pounds soaking wet.  The second thing that  struck me was the incredible animation of Miguel's face.  Sure, Tulio was  much &quot;purtier&quot;, but it was Miguel's far more expressive face that  held me transfixed.  The range of emotions and expressions that showed on  that face reminded me over and over again of the astounding magic of the  animated medium and exactly why I'm working so hard to achieve it in my own  life.  Altogether, The Road to El Dorado was funny, interesting, and  exciting and, as in everything Dreamworks has animated so far, visually  breathtaking.  I'm waiting eagerly for the DVD and I hope it'll have plenty  of features and goodies on it for me to explore!  On a more personal  note, I have to admit I sort of envied Chel in this film-riding off with  two attractive males all to herself-at least, for the time being.  Of  course, if I was in Chel's place, I'd have to say I'd favor Miguel over  Tulio-but then, I've always been a bit of a fool for a pair of big green  eyes on a guy!  lol",5,Waiting impatiently for the DVD!,967334400,"08 27, 2000",2000,2071,"['am', 'very', 'discriminating', 'adult', 'aspiring', 'animator', 'thought', 'Road', 'El', 'Dorado', 'was', 'fantastic', 'was', 'humorous', 'intelligent', 'action-packed', 'finest', 'animation', 'Dreamworks', 'Studios', 'offer', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored', 'single', 'second', 'even', 'went', 'back', 'theatre', 'see', 'second', 'time', 'thought', 'music', 'was', 'catchy', 'interesting', 'original', 'fun', 'really', 'suited', 'feel', 'movie', 'Elton', 'John', 'perfectly', 'wonderful', 'music', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'great', 'lyricist', 'were', 'two', 'things', 'liked', 'particular', 'First', 'heroine', 'Chel', ""n't"", 'slender', 'willow', 'wand', 'girl-a', 'popular', 'heroine', 'depiction', 'anorexia', 'bulemia', 'early', 'age', 'nothing', 'sadder', 'perfectly', 'healthy', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'quot', 'diet', 'quot', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Chel', 'hippy', 'voluptuous', 'plenty', 'meat', 'bones', 'very', 'Frazetta-style', 'fashion-and', 'also', 'very', 'attractive', 'What', 'way', 'insinuate', 'girl', 'can', 'be', 'sexy', 'being', 'one', 'hundred', 'pounds', 'soaking', 'wet', 'second', 'thing', 'struck', 'was', 'incredible', 'animation', 'Miguel', 'face', 'Sure', 'Tulio', 'was', 'much', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'Miguel', 'far', 'more', 'expressive', 'face', 'held', 'transfixed', 'range', 'emotions', 'expressions', 'showed', 'face', 'reminded', 'over', 'again', 'astounding', 'magic', 'animated', 'medium', 'exactly', 'why', ""'m"", 'working', 'so', 'hard', 'achieve', 'own', 'life', 'Altogether', 'Road', 'El', 'Dorado', 'was', 'funny', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'everything', 'Dreamworks', 'animated', 'so', 'far', 'visually', 'breathtaking', ""'m"", 'waiting', 'eagerly', 'DVD', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'have', 'plenty', 'features', 'goodies', 'explore', 'more', 'personal', 'note', 'have', 'admit', 'sort', 'envied', 'Chel', 'film-riding', 'off', 'two', 'attractive', 'males', 'herself-at', 'least', 'time', 'being', 'course', 'was', 'Chel', 'place', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', ""'d"", 'favor', 'Miguel', 'Tulio-but', 'then', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'fool', 'pair', 'big', 'green', 'eyes', 'guy', 'lol']",N/A

524464,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXG6,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","""The Road to El Dorado"" is no great shakes as an animated film, but it makes for a relatively breezy, relatively painless way to spend a spare ninety minutes.  The film tells the too-familiar story of a couple of fortune hunting con artists who stumble quite by accident onto an ancient civilization and are immediately mistaken for messianic gods.  In this case, the lovable rogues are Tulio and Miguel, two early 16th century Spaniards who, in a rigged game of dice, win a map to the legendary land of gold called El Dorado, reportedly located in the recently discovered New World.Voiced by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh, respectively, Tulio and Miguel become surprisingly endearing characters.  The script uses the traditional approach of domesticating history by having its characters utilize mannerisms and speech patterns that are decidedly contemporary in nature - but at least in this case some of the humor that arises from this comedic use of anachronism is actually funny.  Add to the mix a feisty Rosie Perez as a cynical Indian maiden who comes between the men, along with some ""good"" and ""evil"" natives - and the stage is set for some internecine as well as cross-cultural conflicts.Despite the banality of the story, the film moves at a relatively brisk pace, stopping just long enough at points to squeeze in the inevitable musical numbers, penned this time by none other than the songwriting team of Elton John and Tim Rice.  The backgrounds are colorful, the animation clever and exciting and the soft-pedaling of the horrors of this particular period in history understandable in the context of a movie aimed essentially at little children.""The Road to El Dorado"" will not go into the books as an animation classic, but by not taking itself too seriously, the film earns a decent amount of good will from its target audience.",3,not great but likable,986601600,"04 7, 2001",2001,1846,"['Road', 'El', 'Dorado', 'great', 'shakes', 'animated', 'film', 'relatively', 'breezy', 'relatively', 'painless', 'way', 'spend', 'spare', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'film', 'too-familiar', 'story', 'couple', 'fortune', 'hunting', 'con', 'artists', 'who', 'stumble', 'quite', 'accident', 'ancient', 'civilization', 'are', 'immediately', 'mistaken', 'messianic', 'gods', 'case', 'lovable', 'rogues', 'are', 'Tulio', 'Miguel', 'two', 'early', '16th', 'century', 'Spaniards', 'who', 'rigged', 'game', 'dice', 'win', 'map', 'legendary', 'land', 'gold', 'called', 'El', 'Dorado', 'reportedly', 'located', 'recently', 'discovered', 'New', 'World.Voiced', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'respectively', 'Tulio', 'Miguel', 'become', 'surprisingly', 'endearing', 'characters', 'script', 'traditional', 'approach', 'domesticating', 'history', 'having', 'characters', 'utilize', 'mannerisms', 'speech', 'patterns', 'are', 'decidedly', 'contemporary', 'nature', 'least', 'case', 'humor', 'comedic', 'use', 'anachronism', 'actually', 'funny', 'Add', 'mix', 'feisty', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'cynical', 'Indian', 'maiden', 'who', 'men', 'good', 'evil', 'stage', 'set', 'internecine', 'as', 'well', 'cross-cultural', 'conflicts.Despite', 'banality', 'story', 'film', 'moves', 'relatively', 'brisk', 'pace', 'stopping', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'points', 'squeeze', 'inevitable', 'musical', 'numbers', 'penned', 'time', 'none', 'other', 'songwriting', 'team', 'Elton', 'John', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'colorful', 'animation', 'clever', 'exciting', 'soft-pedaling', 'horrors', 'particular', 'period', 'history', 'understandable', 'context', 'movie', 'aimed', 'essentially', 'little', 'children', 'Road', 'El', 'Dorado', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'books', 'animation', 'classic', 'not', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'film', 'decent', 'amount', 'good', 'will', 'target', 'audience']",N/A

Unto my analysis:The story - there's not much of a complicated plot here, as this movie was made (and should be seen) just for the fun of it. Miguel and Tulio are two friends who sail from con to con. Trying to escape from angry sailors who figured out that Tulio and Miguel had cheated, the two friends wound up on Cortes' ship. They're discovered, sent to a brig, where later Cortes' warhorse, Altivo, &quot;helps&quot; them to get out. They drift in the ocean for quite awhile, ending up *gasp* exactly at the beginning of where El Dorado's map (which they got from the sailors back in Spain, who knows how those sailors got it in the irst place) indicated. They find the city, are mistaken for gods, Tulio wants to get out and return to Spain with the gold (who wouldn't?), while Miguel falls in love with the city...at the end, decisions have to be made...the plot's not important here, what's worth your viewing is THE SCRIPT.The music - another great score by Hans Zimmer, though the best pieces of music were scored by John Powell. Elton John's songs, both the ones that made the movie as well as those who didn't, are great.The DVD - this is a kids' DVD, with a &quot;read along&quot; featurette, games for their enjoyment, a PC game demo...but it also has a &quot;making of&quot;, the trailer (you can even laugh with the trailer), commentaries by directors Don Paul and Eric &quot;Bibo&quot; Bergeron, a look at how coloring was approached for each scene, and Elton John's music video for &quot;Someday out of the blue&quot;, in which he is animated.",4,El Camino a The Golden,981331200,"02 5, 2001",2001,1635,"['great', 'movie', 'kids', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'analysis', 'story', 'not', 'much', 'complicated', 'plot', 'here', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'just', 'fun', 'Miguel', 'Tulio', 'are', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'sail', 'con', 'con', 'Trying', 'escape', 'angry', 'sailors', 'who', 'figured', 'out', 'Tulio', 'Miguel', 'had', 'cheated', 'two', 'friends', 'wound', 'up', 'Cortes', 'ship', ""'re"", 'discovered', 'sent', 'brig', 'where', 'later', 'Cortes', 'warhorse', 'Altivo', 'quot', 'quot', 'get', 'out', 'drift', 'ocean', 'quite', 'awhile', 'ending', 'up', '*gasp*', 'exactly', 'beginning', 'where', 'El', 'Dorado', 'map', 'got', 'sailors', 'back', 'Spain', 'who', 'how', 'sailors', 'got', 'irst', 'place', 'indicated', 'find', 'city', 'are', 'mistaken', 'gods', 'Tulio', 'get', 'out', 'return', 'Spain', 'gold', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'Miguel', 'love', 'city', 'end', 'decisions', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'plot', 'not', 'important', 'here', 'what', 'worth', 'viewing', 'THE', 'SCRIPT.The', 'music', 'great', 'score', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'best', 'pieces', 'music', 'were', 'scored', 'John', 'Powell', 'Elton', 'John', 'songs', 'ones', 'made', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'are', 'great.The', 'DVD', 'kids', 'DVD', 'quot', 'read', 'quot', 'featurette', 'games', 'enjoyment', 'PC', 'game', 'demo', 'also', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'trailer', 'can', 'even', 'laugh', 'trailer', 'commentaries', 'directors', 'Don', 'Paul', 'Eric', 'quot', 'Bibo', 'quot', 'Bergeron', 'look', 'how', 'coloring', 'was', 'approached', 'scene', 'Elton', 'John', 'music', 'video', 'quot', 'Someday', 'blue', 'quot', 'animated']",N/A

The story follows two con men on their quest to the legendary El Dorado City of gold. Through a series of hilarious mishaps, they find the city and become worshiped by the people. Helping them in on the con is Chel, an attractive native who wants to go to Spain with our duo. In the end they do the right thing and protect the city but lose the gold.Road to El Dorado is a little more adult than most animated movies, but that's a good thing. American animation really needs to grow up if hand drawn animation is to survive in a world where computer animated characters are becoming the norm. Hand drawn animation needs more stories like this, not less. Japanese animation is full of adult situations, and violence. The Simpsons and Family Guy can depict adult situations, on TV then why not a feature length movie.The music is great, the hand drawn animation and CGI blend beautifully and Elton John and Tim Rice's songs are perfect. Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline have great chemistry in their voice-over performances, perhaps they could do a live action ""Road"". Rosie Perez is great as Chel I really wish Road to El Dorado did better at the box office the ending had me wanting a sequel.

Katzenburg try to say he believed this was Tim Rice's and Elton John's best yet, music wise...I didn't find the music appealing at all. It sounded like ripped off Lion King.

That can also be a downfall as some of their movies aren't appropriate for small children to watch alone, but they have a wider audience appeal.The Road to El Dorado is a good movie, as good as any Disney's put out in the last 7 or so years.  With the exception of a duet by Brannagh and Kline, all the music is voiced by Elton John, which I thought was a better idea than having all the characters sing, then you don't have to worry about the singing voices matching up to the speaking ones.The story is pretty standard, although it's nice to see it told from the rogues point of view, it gave the story a little more depth.  Even Chel, the native girl is a bit of a rogue, and conspires with Tulio and Miguel to take the old and run. Altivo the horse steals the show from the human characters, I don't know why, but every animated movie seems to have an animal show stealer.The artwork on this movie is amazing, in the DVd feature about making El Dorado they show shots of Chichen Itza and Tulum, in the Yukitan peninsula of Mexico, and they make El Dorado look very much like it. Also, through the use of computer animation they're able to give a shine to the gold in the city that makes it gleam like nothing else.All in all this is a good family movie, there's lots of kid humor, music and bright colours to keep the kids interested, and there's some more mature things that can fly over the kid's heads and keep the adult's attention.",4,Good Family Comedy,1009065600,"12 23, 2001",2001,1549,"['One', 'thing', 'like', 'Dreamworks', 'ability', 'come', 'up', 'family', 'shows', 'not', 'just', 'children', 'movies', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'downfall', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'small', 'children', 'watch', 'alone', 'have', 'wider', 'audience', 'appeal.The', 'Road', 'El', 'Dorado', 'good', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'Disney', 'put', 'out', 'last', '7', 'so', 'years', 'exception', 'duet', 'Brannagh', 'Kline', 'music', 'voiced', 'Elton', 'John', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'idea', 'having', 'characters', 'sing', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'singing', 'voices', 'matching', 'up', 'speaking', 'ones.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'standard', 'nice', 'see', 'told', 'rogues', 'point', 'view', 'gave', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'Even', 'Chel', 'native', 'girl', 'bit', 'rogue', 'conspires', 'Tulio', 'Miguel', 'take', 'old', 'run', 'Altivo', 'horse', 'show', 'human', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'animated', 'movie', 'have', 'animal', 'show', 'stealer.The', 'artwork', 'movie', 'amazing', 'DVd', 'feature', 'making', 'El', 'Dorado', 'show', 'shots', 'Chichen', 'Itza', 'Tulum', 'Yukitan', 'peninsula', 'Mexico', 'make', 'El', 'Dorado', 'look', 'very', 'much', 'Also', 'use', 'computer', 'animation', ""'re"", 'able', 'give', 'shine', 'gold', 'city', 'nothing', 'else.All', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'lots', 'kid', 'humor', 'music', 'bright', 'colours', 'keep', 'kids', 'interested', 'more', 'mature', 'things', 'can', 'fly', 'kid', 'heads', 'keep', 'adult', 'attention']",N/A

The movies were also known for their cheesy songs and the frequent breaking of the theatrical fourth wall.With that said, THE ROAD TO EL DORADO is basically another Hope and Crosby film, except it's animated and it doesn't star Hope or Crosby.

The three companions eventually wash up on shore and discover they have landed on the shores of a distant land where El Dorado, the legendary city of gold, can be found.

Nevertheless, THE ROAD TO EL DORADO is more enjoyable than many other animated pictures and proves to be an enjoyable animated action/adventure buddy flick that the entire family can watch together.",4,Another Road Movie.,1021507200,"05 16, 2002",2002,1468,"['Bing', 'Crosby', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'made', 'several', 'quot', 'ROAD', 'quot', 'movies', 'together', 'movies', 'basically', 'had', 'same', 'plot', 'duo', 'traveled', 'far', 'location', 'involved', 'duo', 'getting', 'kind', 'trouble', 'had', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'duo', 'usually', 'Crosby', 'movies', 'were', 'also', 'known', 'cheesy', 'songs', 'frequent', 'breaking', 'theatrical', 'fourth', 'wall.With', 'said', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'EL', 'DORADO', 'basically', 'Hope', 'Crosby', 'film', 'animated', ""n't"", 'star', 'Hope', 'Crosby', 'animated', 'visuals', 'movie', 'are', 'rather', 'spectacular', 'parts', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'keep', 'picture', 'moving', 'bumbling', 'duo', 'Julio', 'Miguel.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'Julio', 'Miguel', 'being', 'accidently', 'stowed', 'away', 'one', 'Cortez', 'ships', 'headed', 'New', 'World', 'duo', 'night', 'process', 'save', 'Cortez', 'prize', 'horse', 'three', 'companions', 'eventually', 'wash', 'up', 'shore', 'discover', 'have', 'landed', 'shores', 'distant', 'land', 'where', 'El', 'Dorado', 'legendary', 'city', 'gold', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Eventually', 'companions', 'find', 'El', 'Dorado', 'are', 'mistaken', 'gods.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'move', 'rather', 'slow', 'film', 'songs', 'written', 'performed', 'Elton', 'John', 'are', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'Nevertheless', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'EL', 'DORADO', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'many', 'other', 'animated', 'pictures', 'proves', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'animated', 'action/adventure', 'buddy', 'flick', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'together']",N/A

This is not correct, they should do things different than  Disney.  This movie is funny, has great visuals and even has nice, but  forgettable, songs.  Elton John and Tim Rice did not reprissed their Lion  King Success.  Hans Zimmer didn't do it either.  The story is not as good  as The Liong King or Beauty and the Beast.
