1411461,A1VWWTCCFU8EVQ,B004JHYTHK,A Customer,"[0, 0]","Directed by Patrik Syverson, who hasn't got a large resume but you can tell watching this film he is a good director. The writer Tim Tori has done exceptional work with the story on offer here. I didn't read anything about this film and to be honest my expectations were low....I love being proved wrong. This film is a blast. No Hollywood names, just a young talented cast that come together to create a great slice of horror entertainment.A woman (actress Ruta Gedmintas) wants to leave her dull town for a better life far away from her alcoholic mother. Her friends all come together to help her getaway. We get to know characters and spend time with them before their journey. There is a vehicle breakdown moment in the film that reminded me of `Wolf Creek'. Other moments reminded me of the brilliant 'Triangle'. I enjoyed this film 'Prowl' a great deal. Great story, great script, great cast and it is very exciting.My favourite character in this film is the helpful truck driver `Bernard' played by Bruce Payne. Bruce has worked a great deal in this industry, you may remember him in 'Passenger 57'(1992) playing alongside Wesley Snipes. If not, you may have seen him over the years in other films and on the UK stage and television. We need to see more of Bruce Payne in films, he is incredibly talented. He worked with Steven Berkoff on stage in 'West'(1983) and again with Berkoff in 'Greek' (1988), During this period Bruce and Gary Oldman were working on stage a geat deal. I wonder if Gary ever considered casting Bruce in 'Nil by Mouth'.I just love it when actors that I have respect for, get a great part that reignites their careers like John Travolta in 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) and Ray Winstone in 'Nil by Mouth' (1997). I genuinely hope Bruce will get his moment to shine in something brilliant and high profile.Just three negative criticisms, which are mild: I just wish the violence was increased by another 35% and the gore by 20%. And Bruce Payne in more scenes!If you avoid further plot details and available trailers you will be in for a real treat. 'Prowl' is great fun combined with a clever story that took me on a ride that was unexpected.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com",3,bleedingfilms.com review of  'PROWL',1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2196,"['Directed', 'Patrik', 'Syverson', 'who', ""n't"", 'got', 'large', 'resume', 'can', 'tell', 'watching', 'film', 'good', 'director', 'writer', 'Tim', 'Tori', 'done', 'exceptional', 'work', 'story', 'offer', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'anything', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'expectations', 'were', 'low', '.I', 'being', 'proved', 'wrong', 'film', 'blast', 'Hollywood', 'names', 'just', 'young', 'talented', 'cast', 'together', 'create', 'great', 'slice', 'horror', 'entertainment.A', 'woman', 'actress', 'Ruta', 'Gedmintas', 'leave', 'dull', 'town', 'better', 'life', 'far', 'away', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'friends', 'come', 'together', 'help', 'getaway', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'spend', 'time', 'journey', 'vehicle', 'breakdown', 'moment', 'film', 'reminded', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'Other', 'moments', 'reminded', 'brilliant', 'enjoyed', 'film', ""'Prowl"", 'great', 'deal', 'Great', 'story', 'great', 'script', 'great', 'cast', 'very', 'exciting.My', 'favourite', 'character', 'film', 'helpful', 'truck', 'driver', 'Bernard', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'Bruce', 'worked', 'great', 'deal', 'industry', 'may', 'remember', '57', '1992', 'playing', 'alongside', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'not', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'other', 'films', 'UK', 'stage', 'television', 'need', 'see', 'more', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'films', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'worked', 'Steven', 'Berkoff', 'stage', ""'West"", '1983', 'again', 'Berkoff', ""'Greek"", '1988', 'period', 'Bruce', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'were', 'working', 'stage', 'geat', 'deal', 'wonder', 'Gary', 'ever', 'considered', 'casting', 'Bruce', ""'Nil"", ""Mouth'.I"", 'just', 'love', 'when', 'actors', 'have', 'respect', 'get', 'great', 'part', 'careers', 'John', 'Travolta', ""'Pulp"", 'Fiction', '1994', 'Ray', 'Winstone', ""'Nil"", 'Mouth', '1997', 'genuinely', 'hope', 'Bruce', 'will', 'get', 'moment', 'shine', 'something', 'brilliant', 'high', 'profile.Just', 'three', 'negative', 'criticisms', 'are', 'mild', 'just', 'wish', 'violence', 'was', 'increased', '35', '%', 'gore', '20', '%', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'more', 'scenes', 'avoid', 'further', 'plot', 'details', 'available', 'trailers', 'will', 'be', 'real', 'treat', 'great', 'fun', 'combined', 'clever', 'story', 'took', 'ride', 'was', 'unexpected.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com']",N/A
1411462,AJ7PN0MNUEXCL,B004JHYTHK,"A guy loving talented guys ""Chaka Cenk""","[0, 0]","I came across this movie on TV by pure chance. I was dozing on and off and suddenly the Friday night movie show announced the ""Prowl"". It seemed a nice title to pique my interest and being a horror fan I am, I decided to see it, albeit its late broadcast hour.Usually movies in this genre start off very strong almost with a bang only to constantly go downhill and end with a whimper. Surprisingly this is not the case here. Actually it starts off with one of the silliest premises. Eager to leave her hometown a girl tries to reach a city at a 19-hour distance to pay the deposit of her new rent house. Instead of hopping on a bus, renting a car or just simply using bank EFT, she calls her friends for help, who refuse her on ridiculous premises...Anyway the set-up is very weak and it nearly put me off the whole movie and I just knock off two stars for that poor beginning.To the advantage of the movie, this set-up does not take long and the fun starts quickly. Another complaint is that the initial deaths are very quick and you do not get any sense of horror or thrill but watch as if it is a horror newscast.Then the actual meat of the story, chase-and-run scenes begin and that's where the movie redeems itself. From that point on, it constantly gels into a more solid form with some interesting background ideas, nice scenes and a head villain who it seems has just departed ""Addams' Family"" house.This needs a sequel and I would love to see it because I have a hunch that the ideas that begin to evolve in the latter part of the movie would make a good flick if handled expertly. I have decided to watch all horror movies around so I would eventually see this movi and the sooner the better.With some thrilling scenes, some good make-up, more or less reasonable characters and a sound second part, this movie is watchable to pass time and you won't regret it.At least it is miles better than the Mother of Tears by Argento, which I watched the next day and immensely regretted.",2,A nice way to spend a sluggish Friday night at home.,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,1988,"['came', 'movie', 'TV', 'pure', 'chance', 'was', 'dozing', 'suddenly', 'Friday', 'night', 'movie', 'show', 'announced', 'Prowl', 'seemed', 'nice', 'title', 'pique', 'interest', 'being', 'horror', 'fan', 'am', 'decided', 'see', 'late', 'broadcast', 'hour.Usually', 'movies', 'genre', 'start', 'very', 'strong', 'almost', 'bang', 'only', 'constantly', 'go', 'downhill', 'end', 'whimper', 'Surprisingly', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'Actually', 'one', 'silliest', 'premises', 'Eager', 'leave', 'hometown', 'girl', 'reach', 'city', '19-hour', 'distance', 'pay', 'deposit', 'new', 'rent', 'house', 'Instead', 'hopping', 'bus', 'renting', 'car', 'just', 'simply', 'using', 'bank', 'EFT', 'friends', 'help', 'who', 'refuse', 'ridiculous', 'premises', 'Anyway', 'set-up', 'very', 'weak', 'nearly', 'put', 'off', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'knock', 'off', 'two', 'stars', 'poor', 'advantage', 'movie', 'set-up', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'fun', 'quickly', 'complaint', 'initial', 'deaths', 'are', 'very', 'quick', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'sense', 'horror', 'thrill', 'watch', 'horror', 'actual', 'meat', 'story', 'chase-and-run', 'scenes', 'begin', 'where', 'movie', 'point', 'constantly', 'more', 'solid', 'form', 'interesting', 'background', 'ideas', 'nice', 'scenes', 'head', 'villain', 'who', 'just', 'departed', 'Addams', 'Family', 'house.This', 'sequel', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'have', 'hunch', 'ideas', 'begin', 'evolve', 'latter', 'part', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'flick', 'handled', 'expertly', 'have', 'decided', 'watch', 'horror', 'movies', 'would', 'eventually', 'see', 'movi', 'sooner', 'better.With', 'thrilling', 'scenes', 'good', 'make-up', 'more', 'less', 'reasonable', 'characters', 'sound', 'second', 'part', 'movie', 'watchable', 'pass', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'it.At', 'least', 'miles', 'better', 'Mother', 'Tears', 'Argento', 'watched', 'next', 'day', 'immensely', 'regretted']",N/A

They've been constantly referred to as vampires and/or zombies, which neither is the case.  But I digress.The acting was alright for this genre--I've seen better; I've seen much worse.  But what totally destroyed the movie was the script (or lack thereof).  Nothing is explained, but then how could you explain bird-like creatures who naturally come to this place to learn how to hunt?

They let him lock them in the back.  Besides them, he's hauling a small cargo of boxes clearly marked THIS SIDE UP.  It takes them forever to take a peek and discover he's carrying blood.  He stops, trapping them in a dark warehouse.  They're not alone.  Things come out of the dark and snatch them one by one.  There's much running and screaming and off screen dying.  And then the movie ends.  Oh, and there's a twist of sorts that isn't much of a surprise and really doesn't matter in the end anyway.The ""scares"" were rudimentary (used before in better films).  The acting wasn't bad, though the competency of the characters was always in doubt.  The editing was easily the worst aspect of this movie (the beginning was so confusing: no indication of time or reality; are we watching dreams or hallucinations, premonitions?).  As most of the movie was shot in the dark, much of the action was left to the imagination.  There was a lot of blood but little gore.  I wasn't impressed.  Too many unanswered questions, the greatest of which was: were these creatures vampires or something else?  Did it matter?  Not really.  As a time waster, this was okay and just that.  It wasn't original by any means.  It was adequate.  Would I ever watch it again?  No, it isn't a keeper.  Would I recommend it to anyone else?

So Susie (Ruta Gedmintas - Miss Conception), Ray (Jamie Blackley - Myths), Peter (Joshua Bowman - 13 HRS), Eric (Oliver Hawes - film debut), and Fiona (Perdita Weeks - The Tudors) load the necessities needed to go to the big city for a day - spare clothes, smokes, music, and alcohol. As can be predicted the car breaks down as they leave town, and they accept a ride from Bernard (Bruce Payne - Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God), a semi-truck driver, who just happens to be heading to the city as well. So they load themselves into the back of the trailer, break out the party, and enjoy the ride. At least until they realize that they are in a bad part of town and Bernard isn't stopping when they ask, even with threats of the release of body fluids. When the truck is parked, the door is opened into the loading bay of an abandoned slaughterhouse. This is where anything I say now spoils the movie, so just think ""not what I was expecting"" and unseen twist. Enjoy.Prowl could have been a completely different type of horror film, easily slipping into the torture porn genre. Instead this flick goes a route you don't see until it happens, and a plot twist that the clues are laid out for, but you'll think along a different plot line.

1411473,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004JHYTHK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Usually, I would absolutely loathe a film like ""Prowl"" due to its lack of reason and logic in setting up the most preposterous scenario possible.  In this movie, a young lady who wants to secure an apartment in the big city needs to make the nineteen hour journey immediately to put down a deposit.  She doesn't have access to a vehicle and so she asks all of her friends, each of whom has an equally preposterous and convenient reason why their cars are unavailable on this particular day.  After finally settling on her last choice, all six of the group think that a road trip would be fun.  The designated car has a break-down right outside of city limits as they are leaving.  Does anyone return home?  Does anyone call another friend to pick them up (they are still in town after all)?  Does anyone try to repair the car now stranded roadside?  Has anyone heard of a rental (at least one kid is flush with money)?  Please..... No, our heroes bundle into the first freight truck that happens by and think that it is a terrific idea to ride in the near empty container.  Heck, it's only a nineteen hour drive--what could be more fun than rolling around in a truck bed?  This set-up is absolutely ridiculous and contrived and no one, in their right mind, would agree to do such a thing--much less six people!In the case of ""Prowl,"" however, this simplemindedness actually serves the material pretty well.  Because with the stupidity out of the way, we're left with a reasonably tense finale.  Of course, things do not go according to plan and the group finds themselves at an abandoned slaughterhouse and things don't look pretty.  The remainder of the movie is an all out assault on the senses as the gang battles for their lives.  While many reviews will undoubtedly give away any surprises (luckily I was able to let the silliness and carnage unfold naturally with no preconceived notions), I will just say that there is plenty of fighting and plenty of death as is oftentimes the case in movies of this type.  The action is relentless and decently choreographed, and I was entertained in a rather detached way.  As an empty headed way to pass the time, ""Prowl"" certainly met my expectations.But here's the good part and my biggest problem.  Once the truth of the situation became clear, I was actually intrigued by the idea.  I was genuinely interested to know more.  The slaughterhouse setting and what it was being used for might have made a really great movie.  The lead villain also piqued my curiosity and I would have wanted to see her developed in more detail.  The good part, I guess, is that the premise was inviting enough for me to actually crave a better movie to explore it.  The bad part is--the filmmakers had no imagination or ambition to make this anything more than what it is.  I see hints of a richer and more satisfying story, but am left with a rather routine splatter-fest.  But since the movie never aspires to anything more, I will say that (for the most part) it accomplishes what it set out to do and is diverting enough.  About 2 1/2 stars, I'll round up for what might have been.

1411475,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004JHYTHK,Mark Turner,"[2, 2]","The After Dark films have been hit or miss since they first began. A collection of films usually made by first timers they range from movies that offer truly innovative ideas and scares to movies that seem to take forever to unwind. Most seem to fall in the middle. But PROWL (aka THE STRAYS) leans to the poor side of the scale.Amber (Courtney Hope) hates the small town she lives in. She dreams of the day when she can escape to the big city and find a life of her own. The chance presents itself with an apartment for rent in Chicago. The catch is that she has to make it there by the next day with the first and last month's rent or the landlord will let it go to someone else.This calls for a road trip! Except that all of her friends have either had their wheels grounded or in the shop for repairs. Except one. Off they go! But that doesn't work out either as the van overheats and ends up on the side of the road. Luckily a truck driver comes along that they eventually talk into taking them to Chicago where he says he's heading. Into the back of the truck they hop and off they go.But they later realize that this driver was anything but a savior. Instead they find he's driven them to some hidden location, an abandoned factory of sorts, and left them there. When the back of the truck opens, they gather their things, click on a flashlight and start looking for a way out. Until one of them is pulled up from the floor in the dark and his head dropped seconds later.The driver has dropped them off in a feeding ground for a group of vampires. He was hauling a load of plasma for them in the back of the truck, but fresh prey is so much better. One by one the group is taken, rather quickly too for an 84 minute film. Amber and her best friend overhear the leader of the group talking and continue to evade their pursuers. But that doesn't last long as her friend is taken and now Amber is forced to fend for herself.The twist in the story then presents itself (don't worry I won't tell you what it is) but it just feels out of place and tacked on even though it's been hinted at (poorly) from the start. The ending doesn't feel like an end but doesn't feel like it leaves an opening for a sequel either. And let's hope one doesn't get made because this movie was boring.Sure horror films are supposed to have jump scenes but there are few of them to be found and when they do they're at times when you pretty much expect them to happen. The acting is sub-par and does little to convince you these are real people, worst of all Courtney Hope in the lead. You don't care about anyone before they get slaughtered and you sure don't care about them after.Shot mostly in darkness (I guess because of a low budget) with a soundtrack that goes from wanting to get closer to hear what's being said to being blasted out of your seat, the movie offers nothing that would make me seek out anything made by this director or writer in the future. A good horror film offers you something scary, something original, something a bit different and this film offered none of those things. I take part of that back. It does offer something original in the suddenly tossed out explanation but its nothing that's the least bit interesting. Perhaps in the hands of a better writer it might have but here it just seems added on. As much as I love scary movies, this one is best left unrented.",2,HOW NOT TO MAKE A VAMPIRE FILM,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,3381,"['Dark', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'hit', 'miss', 'first', 'began', 'collection', 'films', 'usually', 'made', 'first', 'timers', 'range', 'movies', 'offer', 'truly', 'innovative', 'ideas', 'scares', 'movies', 'seem', 'take', 'forever', 'unwind', 'Most', 'seem', 'fall', 'middle', 'PROWL', 'THE', 'STRAYS', 'poor', 'side', 'scale.Amber', 'Courtney', 'Hope', 'small', 'town', 'day', 'when', 'can', 'escape', 'big', 'city', 'find', 'life', 'own', 'chance', 'apartment', 'rent', 'Chicago', 'catch', 'make', 'there', 'next', 'day', 'first', 'last', 'month', 'rent', 'landlord', 'will', 'let', 'go', 'someone', 'else.This', 'road', 'trip', 'friends', 'have', 'had', 'wheels', 'grounded', 'shop', 'repairs', 'one', 'go', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'either', 'van', 'overheats', 'up', 'side', 'road', 'Luckily', 'truck', 'driver', 'along', 'eventually', 'talk', 'taking', 'Chicago', 'where', 'heading', 'back', 'truck', 'hop', 'go.But', 'later', 'realize', 'driver', 'was', 'anything', 'savior', 'Instead', 'find', 'driven', 'hidden', 'location', 'abandoned', 'factory', 'sorts', 'left', 'there', 'When', 'back', 'truck', 'gather', 'things', 'click', 'flashlight', 'start', 'looking', 'way', 'out', 'one', 'pulled', 'up', 'floor', 'dark', 'head', 'dropped', 'later.The', 'driver', 'dropped', 'off', 'feeding', 'ground', 'group', 'vampires', 'was', 'hauling', 'load', 'plasma', 'back', 'truck', 'fresh', 'prey', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'One', 'one', 'group', 'taken', 'rather', 'quickly', 'too', '84', 'minute', 'film', 'Amber', 'best', 'friend', 'leader', 'group', 'talking', 'continue', 'evade', 'pursuers', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'friend', 'taken', 'now', 'Amber', 'forced', 'fend', 'herself.The', 'twist', 'story', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'just', 'place', 'tacked', 'even', 'been', 'hinted', 'poorly', 'start', 'ending', ""n't"", 'feel', 'end', ""n't"", 'feel', 'opening', 'sequel', 'either', 'let', 'hope', 'one', ""n't"", 'get', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'boring.Sure', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'jump', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'be', 'found', 'when', 'do', ""'re"", 'times', 'when', 'pretty', 'much', 'expect', 'happen', 'acting', 'sub-par', 'little', 'convince', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'worst', 'Courtney', 'Hope', 'lead', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anyone', 'get', 'slaughtered', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'after.Shot', 'mostly', 'darkness', 'guess', 'low', 'budget', 'soundtrack', 'wanting', 'get', 'closer', 'hear', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'being', 'blasted', 'seat', 'movie', 'nothing', 'would', 'make', 'seek', 'out', 'anything', 'made', 'director', 'writer', 'future', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'offers', 'something', 'scary', 'something', 'original', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'film', 'offered', 'none', 'things', 'take', 'part', 'back', 'offer', 'something', 'original', 'suddenly', 'tossed', 'out', 'explanation', 'nothing', 'least', 'bit', 'interesting', 'Perhaps', 'hands', 'better', 'writer', 'might', 'have', 'here', 'just', 'added', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'scary', 'movies', 'one', 'best', 'left', 'unrented']",N/A

Based on the other two reviews I was really looking forward to this but I can only assume that my expectations are higher. To start with the film is 82 minutes long and the first 30 deal with introducing the characters who are the usual stereotypical slasher movie teen victims and their abduction. Only when the abducted teens get to their destination does the film begin to pick up speed and most of that speed is vampires rushing around on the edge of your vision and too fast to really take in. The story line from then is just a chase sequence with the victims being picked off one by one (and there's only six of them). I had suspected the obvious survivor's role in this but it was still a suprise how it was revealed. The ending was okay and set the scene for what could be a much better movie in the sequel but hopefully with a better title, Prowl 2 anyone? The production qualities are good, the acting is okay and the vampires are a straight lift from '30 days of night' but without their unique language. In fact with a bit of rewriting this could have slotted into that mythology quite nicely. The soundtrack won't stretch your system and the music sadly lacked the sinisterness of '30 days'. The only extras on my blu ray were a couple of trailers so this is definitely one to buy on dvd because the dearer media has no real advantages. I was always going to buy this for my vampire film collection but the other reviews led me to believe it would be a lot better.

She, along with her dopey friends, get a lift from a trucker (Bruce Payne), but it isn;t long before they realize that something is very, very wrong.

The vampires themselves feel like rip-offs of the vamps from 30 Days of Night, and the big twist can be seen coming a mile away.

There's nothing in here you haven't seen before, but at least you haven't seen some of it presented in quite this way.Plot: Amber (&lt;em>Salt&lt;/em>'s Courtney Hope) is sick of small-town life and is desperate to get out. So when she has a chance to rent an apartment in Chicago, she takes it, and convinces five of her friends to come along to help her unload the van: Suzy (&lt;em>Miss Conception&lt;/em>'s Ruta Gedmintas), Peter (&lt;em>Revenge&lt;/em>'s Joshua Bowman), Fiona (&lt;em>Hamlet&lt;/em>'s Perdita Weeks), Ray (&lt;em>London Boulevard&lt;/em>'s Jamie Blackley), and Veronica (&lt;em>Conspiracy Theory&lt;/em>'s Saxon Trainor). Needless to say, since this is a horror film, the van breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and the six of them are stranded until a helpful truck driver (&lt;em>Passenger 57&lt;/em>'s Bruce Payne) comes along to offer them a ride. Only problem is, it's not a ride to where they want to go...The best thing about this flick, to me, is the fact that our main characters are actually sort of intelligent, at least compared to the drooling morons who normally end up as monster food in horror movies. The scene where the six of them are negotiating the details of their ride with the truck driver is the kind of thing you &lt;em>never&lt;/em> see in a horror film. I'm not sure I've ever seen anything quite like it in any other film, for that matter. The kids are smart, they're circumspect, they know how to get along in today's society. Not that that helps them, but let's face it, stranger danger takes on a whole new meaning when you're dealing with monsters. It also helps that the main characters are all at least well-acted, with a couple of them really standing out (Hope and Gedmintas, and I don't say this just because of the truth-or-dare scene... though I'll admit it sure helped.)Balancing that out is the fact that, as I mentioned previously, this territory has been sniffed over by a whole lotta dogs before, and many of them have left their mark; this is even true of the Big Twist Ending(TM), so when you're watching this and you think you know what's coming next, well, you're probably right. Still, it's an enjoyable way to turn your brain off for an hour and a half, and a great excuse for popcorn consumption. **",2,"Dumber than its characters, but still fun.",1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,2516,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Prowl', 'lt', '>', 'Patrik', 'Syversen', '2010', 'Surprisingly', 'less-than-awful', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'Dark', 'original', 'very', 'very', 'worn', 'ground', 'still', 'find', 'few', 'new', 'things', 'keep', 'audience', 'interest', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'least', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'presented', 'quite', 'way.Plot', 'Amber', 'lt', '>', 'Salt', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Courtney', 'Hope', 'sick', 'small-town', 'life', 'desperate', 'get', 'out', 'So', 'when', 'chance', 'rent', 'apartment', 'Chicago', 'convinces', 'five', 'friends', 'come', 'along', 'help', 'unload', 'van', 'Suzy', 'lt', '>', 'Miss', 'Conception', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Ruta', 'Gedmintas', 'Peter', 'lt', '>', 'Revenge', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Joshua', 'Bowman', 'Fiona', 'lt', '>', 'Hamlet', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Perdita', 'Weeks', 'Ray', 'lt', '>', 'London', 'Boulevard', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Jamie', 'Blackley', 'Veronica', 'lt', '>', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Saxon', 'Trainor', 'Needless', 'say', 'horror', 'film', 'van', 'down', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'six', 'are', 'stranded', 'helpful', 'truck', 'driver', 'lt', '>', 'Passenger', '57', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'along', 'offer', 'ride', 'Only', 'problem', 'not', 'ride', 'where', 'want', 'go', 'best', 'thing', 'flick', 'fact', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'sort', 'intelligent', 'least', 'compared', 'drooling', 'morons', 'who', 'normally', 'end', 'up', 'monster', 'food', 'horror', 'movies', 'scene', 'where', 'six', 'are', 'negotiating', 'details', 'ride', 'truck', 'driver', 'kind', 'thing', 'lt', '>', 'never', 'lt', '>', 'see', 'horror', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'other', 'film', 'matter', 'kids', 'are', 'smart', ""'re"", 'circumspect', 'know', 'how', 'get', 'along', 'today', 'society', 'Not', 'let', 'face', 'stranger', 'danger', 'whole', 'new', 'meaning', 'when', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'monsters', 'also', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'least', 'well-acted', 'couple', 'really', 'standing', 'out', 'Hope', 'Gedmintas', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'just', 'truth-or-dare', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'sure', 'helped', 'Balancing', 'out', 'fact', 'that', 'mentioned', 'previously', 'territory', 'been', 'sniffed', 'over', 'whole', 'lotta', 'dogs', 'many', 'have', 'left', 'mark', 'even', 'true', 'Big', 'Twist', 'Ending', 'TM', 'so', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'well', ""'re"", 'probably', 'right', 'Still', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'turn', 'brain', 'hour', 'half', 'great', 'excuse', 'popcorn', 'consumption', '**']",N/A

Amber and her five friends (and no, that isn't a euphemism) head off on a road trip for some reasons that don't matter. They're picked up by a trucker who seems nice enough, until he drops them off at an abandoned warehouse where the cast of 30 DAYS OF NIGHT are hanging out. The vamps go lala and Amber's crew are picked off one by one. And that's about the height of it.Despite this less than enthusiastic summary, I enjoyed PROWL. It was a fun, well acted and good looking flick that suffered from one major flaw: there wasn't really any plot as such. In fact, it felt like they'd just shot a load of scenes and patched them together in post-production. But with a running time of around 80 mins, I could overlook the lack of plot: this is not a film that outstays its welcome.Basically, if you liked 30 DAYS, you'll enjoy this.
