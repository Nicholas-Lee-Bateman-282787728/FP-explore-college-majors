962458,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000CSTK74,Jeffery Mingo,"[23, 24]","This documentary was made before the Hollywood film ""Wind Talkers.""  The film implied that non-Native soldiers were instructed to kill Navajo translators if they were about to be captured by the Japanese.  This documentary mentioned a Navajo non-Code Talker who was tortured by the Japanese, but doesn't make the aforementioned claim.This work is much stronger than ""The Navajo Code Talkers: Top Secret Mission.""  That documentary praised a clergy member involved with the program whereas this documentary questions that person's significance.  Furthermore, this documentary talks about the genocide that Navajos faced in the past.  They had their own Trail of Tears which led in the opposite direction.  Further, just as African-American soldiers have decried the racism in the 1940s military, this documentary noted that the Code Talkers received no special accolades after the War ended.  One Navajo equated Japanese aggression in Asia with what Navajos faced in America; this was insightful in the same way that Celie's daughter equated African sexism with American racism in ""The Color Purple.""All the veteran Code Talkers were male, but this documentary includes  female curator that adds gender diversity.  The Navajo vets are now sweet, old men that will remind many of their grandfathers.  This may be a great work for teachers to show to Native American students.  In fact, foreign language instructors may want to show this to all students.  Unfortunately, the military could use this as a recruitment tool as well.",5,Impressive work on Dine' Veterans,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,1526,"['documentary', 'was', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'Talkers', 'film', 'implied', 'non-Native', 'soldiers', 'were', 'instructed', 'kill', 'Navajo', 'translators', 'were', 'be', 'captured', 'Japanese', 'documentary', 'mentioned', 'Navajo', 'non-Code', 'Talker', 'who', 'was', 'tortured', 'Japanese', ""n't"", 'make', 'aforementioned', 'claim.This', 'work', 'much', 'stronger', 'Navajo', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'Top', 'Secret', 'Mission', 'documentary', 'praised', 'clergy', 'member', 'involved', 'program', 'documentary', 'questions', 'person', 'significance', 'Furthermore', 'documentary', 'talks', 'genocide', 'Navajos', 'faced', 'past', 'had', 'own', 'Trail', 'Tears', 'led', 'opposite', 'direction', 'Further', 'just', 'African-American', 'soldiers', 'have', 'decried', 'racism', '1940s', 'military', 'documentary', 'noted', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'received', 'special', 'accolades', 'War', 'ended', 'One', 'Navajo', 'equated', 'Japanese', 'aggression', 'Asia', 'what', 'Navajos', 'faced', 'America', 'was', 'insightful', 'same', 'way', 'Celie', 'daughter', 'equated', 'African', 'sexism', 'American', 'racism', 'Color', 'Purple', 'veteran', 'Code', 'Talkers', 'were', 'male', 'documentary', 'female', 'curator', 'gender', 'diversity', 'Navajo', 'vets', 'are', 'now', 'sweet', 'old', 'men', 'will', 'remind', 'many', 'grandfathers', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'work', 'teachers', 'show', 'Native', 'American', 'students', 'fact', 'foreign', 'language', 'instructors', 'may', 'want', 'show', 'students', 'Unfortunately', 'military', 'could', 'use', 'recruitment', 'tool', 'as', 'well']",In Search of History: Navajo Code Talkers
