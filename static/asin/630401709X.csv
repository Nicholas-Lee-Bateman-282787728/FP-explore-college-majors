The races were so horrible as I watched them strain to breaking points, sweat pouring off them and the pain in each face. The drama that enfolded at each day was far than a boring marathon. Even dancing alone (or rather swaying) they had that distant and tired look in their eyes. Jane Fonda was so great in this. I applaud this woman.Such a heart breaker. Such acting.

I questioned others about it, and they couldn't tell me much, even those who had seen it.  I went to the video store, and the clerk had to pull it from the &quot;archive&quot; section... see a pattern?It's sad when a movie this intricate doesn't get longstanding notice.  It did win awards and recognition, and even some notoriety, in its time, but it's certainly not discussed alongside other classics these days, and I plan do do my very little part to remedy this by simple word-of-mouth.  So buy/rent this movie and see how a Depression-era dance marathon encapsulates the game of life.

396145,A2D59KBT80LZ7L,630401709X,"Bob Pr. ""Bob Pr.""","[0, 1]","Dance marathons started in the 1920s and became especially popular during the '30s America's Great Depression. Jobs were scarce, millions were hungry and desperate (there were no social nets: no welfare, no unemployment checks, no medical services for the poor, etc.) These marathons dangled the false promise of rich rewards to the desperate: the one winning couple left standing, surviving after thousands of hours dancing/moving 40-60 days--(contestants danced 24/7 in 2 hour shifts interrupted by 10 minute breaks for sleep/rest/eats, and the big, big plus: being served 7 meals every 24 hours).The reward promised (say $1,500) to the winning couple was enough to buy 2 new Ford or Chevvy cars (in 1934) with almost $400 left over. And even the losing participants got free meals and a place to stay--for as long as they continued dancing.This film only indirectly captures the desperation flooding America at that time and which drove these marathon dancers to participate--and their spectators, many almost as strapped, who flocked to watch spectacles so very similar to those brutal, barbaric survival battles in the Coliseum in ancient Rome.It DOES depict quite well the common, transient bouts of psychosis (getting ""squirrely"" in marathoners' parlance), the lugging around of sleeping partners by whichever partner was more awake, the drastic ""first aid"" measures used to keep dancers participating, and several behind the scenes' behaviors associated with these inhumane, torturous spectacles, etc.And, the MANY ways the sponsors shaped their presentation to entertain their audiences, e.g.: spotlighting the talents of individual dancers, elimination derbies, secretly destroying a dancer's clothing to make a more pitiful scene, announcing that a popular dancer who collapsed was now recovering nicely in a hospital rather than the truth: he'd died from over-exertion in the marathon (since the truth would create bad publicity).Also, this movie reveals the naked truth of these marathons: despite the hype, they were just scams run solely to enrich their promoters, designed to lure in both participants and (paying) audiences. The promoters always deducted from the winning couple's $1,500 ""prize"" their ""accrued bills"" for ALL their food, food prep, rooms, sleeping supplies, ""medical services,"" notifications, etc., to the point that even the ""winners"" ended up nearly as poor as when they started and very lucky that they received ANY reward at all.Fonda's character from the beginning is so critical, so caustic, she's never likable (IMO). She'd obviously been previously hurt, abused, seriously emotionally scarred. Why and in what ways?--that we're entirely left to conjecture, and to me, that's the downside of this film; that narrative arc is left blank. The film's great upside is its poignant, rich portrayal of this unique slice of an American era.Gig Young's Oscar for marathon ""ring master"" was well deserved; he was superb and his performance significantly gave this film its strength, quality and drive.(June Havoc's book, ""Early Havoc,"" provides great detail about these from her several appearances as a horse in marathons.

396146,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,630401709X,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[11, 12]","To me Pollack &amp; company perfectly realized Horace McCoy's saturnine vision. This is the most relentless, hard-knuckled, diabolically-paced piece of filmmaking ever. There is not a dishonest moment in the movie.  It's also the greatest example of ensemble acting I've ever seen on screen  as well. Everyone involved in the production gave every ounce of themselves  and it shows. It may have finished off Gig Young. His portrayal of the  &quot;Yowzer, Yowzering&quot; MC is the most cynical, world-weary  characterization ever expressed on celluloid. It doesn't surprise me that  he checked out in real life shortly after winning an Oscar for his  supporting role. Jane Fonda gives the performance of her life as Gloria.  She would have won an Oscar here if she hadn't recently received one for  Klute. There's no use in singling out anyone else, though Suzannah York  truly deserved her Oscar as well. Everyone in this movie deserved an Oscar.  I would have given one to the second-grip, if there were an award for that.The soundtrack is absolutely first-rate. I owned it on vinyl, but can't  find it on CD unfortunately. If anyone out there is aware of a CD release,  would you please send me mail? I've never known another soundtrack that  served as such perfect accompaniment to the action on screen. Sometimes it  served as a great vehicle for irony (as if this film needed any more of  that!). The second &quot;Derby&quot; sequence is a great case-in-point. As  The Sailor (Red Buttons) is literally expiring from exhaustion, the band is  playing &quot;By the Sea, By the Sea, By the Beautiful Sea.&quot; The  dancehall is situated on a pier above the Pacific. The metaphors come fast  and furious in this movie. It rewards repeated viewings. McCoy's novel is  pretty good too, along the lines of Nathaniel West's Day of the Locust.For $14, you can't make a better investment if you are any kind of film  buff or just want a good kick in the emotional keister. Not for the  sentimental type. About as fierce and unflinching a look into the depths of  the human spirit as you are likely to come across.

396154,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,630401709X,David Baldwin,"[3, 3]","I couldn't help in watching Sidney Pollack's mesmerizing film in making the connection between the Depression era marathon dancers and today's TV reality show participants.  At least the marathoners were doing it for three hots and a cot and not the promise of fame and fortune.  In both cases there are greedy impressarios(are you listening Mark Burnett?) who exploit the contestants dreams and aspirations.  Director Pollack stages the action almost exclusively in a California beach dancehall which gives one a sense of claustrophobia and ultimately prisonlike.  The few instances where a door opens to let in the light the effect is blinding.  The ensemble that Pollack has gathered here is uniformly superb.  Jane Fonda's work here as Gloria, a sullen actress, is probably what delivered her to the mainstream from the drek she was doing for her then husband Roger Vadim.  Gloria isn't a very sympathetic character but we cannot help but empathize with her deluded dream of winning the marathon.  The real star here is Gig Young as the vile impressario, Rocky.  Rocky is omniscient and knows how this dance of the damned will end but the show and the bucks must go on.  Young deservedly won the Oscar for his work here.

396156,AVCRD98TH48RN,630401709X,D. Knouse,"[5, 5]","This film is a unique experience.  It is a tale set during the Great Depression in the setting of a Dance Marathon where hope and perseverence are seemingly the only factors driving the contestants.  Eventually, after days and days, the contestants rise up and plod on more out of a sense of habit and expected exhaustion.  Near the end of the story it matters very little who will win but rather who is still dancing.  Each couple pushes themselves to the brink of collapse...and beyond.  This is a truly fascinating tale about living on through the worst of times even though the best of times is nowhere in sight.  As for the acting there are many standout performances, my particular favorites being Jane Fonda and Gig Young.  Jane Fonda plays a character cast in iron (in fact, she and her dance partner are sponsored at one point and forced to where jackets advertising ""Jonathan's Iron Tonic""), but as she progresses through the competition she slowly begins to break down.  Piece by piece is thrown aside; her staunchly moral character at the beginning of the story gradually unravels until she is an empty shell, devoid of hopeful emotions.  Gig Young's performance is no less mesmerizing as the Master of Ceremonies selling suffering to the spectators at two bits a head.  But just when you think you've pegged the villain of the story he shows that he too is a lost soul trapped on the ""merry-go-round"" of life and conveys compassion and understanding to those most in need.  His performance garnered him a well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  The actual filmmaking is edgy and spectacular.  With all the dancers struggling to stay upright during a portion of the Dance Marathon called the ""Derby"" the background music is light-hearted and frollicking while the contestants are gasping for breath, stumbling in pain, all for the sake of entertainment.  They are dancing and racing toward a cash prize, but their anguish is on display for all who pay to see it.  There are also some flash-forward scenes that are effectively shot on sound stages, with all the surrounding echo in the chamber as the main character speaks, adding to the reflective quality of his remembrance.  This film is crammed with many brilliant scenes that make it a remarkable experience to behold.  Highly recommended.

The film takes place in 1932 California & depicts one of the darkest hours of American history:  the great depression.During this turbulant time, one of the most popular ways for jobless & homeless people to try (almost always in vain) to make a buck was to participate in a dancethon.  These were like a circus freak show, only much worse.  10s of couples would start the dancethon in hopes of being the ""last couple standing"" to win the prize money.  There was usually a 10 minute break every 2 hours, and a few hours of sleep @ night.  Other than that, they were in constant motion.  They even had to eat while standing up & dancing.The film stars Jane Fonda and Bonnie Bedelia in their younger years.  However, it is Gig Young, playing the ruthless & sadistic club owner who steals the show.  Young's character is the exemplar of swindlers in the 1930s who generated a profit by marketing the old dictum that ""desperate times call for desperate measures.""As I was watching this movie, it struck me that the prize money, for which the contestants on-screen were undergoing the most unimaginable and grueling agony, was actually worth less than the HDTV upon which I was watching the film.  Granted, $1,500 went a lot further in the 1930s than today.  Nevertheless, it was a humbling thought.The scariest part about this movie is that it's not about something out of the middle ages.  Nor does it detail the austere rites of some distant, reclusive & primitive 3rd world country.  Rather, it is something that really happened IN THIS COUNTRY, and it occurred in the 20th century.  So many times we tend to think that we are way past the barbarisms and atrocities that we associate with our long ago ancestors.  This story makes crystal clear that fallacy of believing that.  As Mark Twain would say, the rumours of human cruelty's demise have been greatly exaggerated.This is a film that depicts social Darwinism in its most austere and extreme manifistation.  The symbolism re: shooting lame horses when they can no longer run is incredibly trenchant.

To a great degree, it still does today given the ceaseless appetite for reality TV. Just before his filmmaking career took off, Sydney Pollack helmed this powerful but relentlessly downbeat 1969 drama about one such marathon dance contest set in a decrepit dance hall on the Santa Monica Pier in 1932. Adapted by screenwriters James Poe and Robert E. Thompson, the movie takes the semi-famous 1935 Horace McCoy novel and highlights the microcosm that the author created to show how hopeless people felt during the depths of the Depression, none more so than Gloria Beatty, the embittered and failed wannabe actress desperate to win half the $1,500 grand prize.In her breakthrough dramatic role, Jane Fonda brings an unmitigated feral quality to Gloria that must have been startling at the time since her previous two films were the lightweight ""Barefoot in the Park"" and the campy pin-up comic fantasy, ""Barbarella"". For all her outwardly aggressive behavior, Gloria could have been a completely detestable character, but Fonda makes her desperation and diminished self-worth palpable in surprisingly subtle ways. The other standouts in the cast are a very young Bonnie Bedelia as the extremely pregnant Ruby clinging in exhaustion to her husband, Susannah York as the unstable starlet Alice, Red Buttons as seen-it-all Sailor, and Gig Young who upturned his long-established light comedy image as the Machiavellian dance emcee Rocky.You will likely recognize Al Lewis (Grandpa on ""The Munsters"") as Rocky's mercenary assistant Turkey and Michael Conrad (Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on ""Hill Street Blues"") as the cynical roller skating referee. The fly in the ointment is wide-eyed Michael Sarrazin, who plays the circumstantial protagonist Robert Syverton with an utter lack of depth. Pollack unfortunately uses a flash-forward technique with Robert which punctuates the story unnecessarily. However, when he sticks to the dance hall, he is quite masterful, especially in the two defining derby scenes where he fully captures the desperation of the contestants in a grueling, humiliating foot race. Harry Horner's period production and Philip H. Lathrop's darkly lit cinematography effectively evoke the sleaziness and claustrophobia within the hall in measured detail.

As you know the movie is set during the tail end of The Great Depression in 1934 but like what director Arthur Penn did to ""Bonnie and Clyde"", director Sidney Pollock (I still can't get over him dying) uses that time to express the paranoia that was going on in America during the years after the Kennedy assassination in the 60's-and in some regard what is going on now as the 2000's is about to end. The cast is great-Jane Fonda, Michael Sarrazin, Gig Young, Bruce Dern (who already co-stared with Jane's brother Peter with ""The Wild Angels"" and ""The Trip""), Red Buttons, Bonnie Belinda. But the real star definitely belong to Susannah York-who plays stage actress Alice. As you know she was noninated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for this film, and she lost to Goldie Hawn for ""Cactus Flower"". I saw Hawn's movie and I could only watch the first 30 minutes because it was shockingly over the top (in some regards a microcausm of the 60's ending in chaos) while York's performance in this movie is so good that I'm shocked the Academy didn't give it to her especially the scene in which she is crying over where her dress was. I think she's the only British actress from the 1960's that takes my breath away and it would of capped a fitting end to it having started with ""The Greengage Summer"" in 1961 and then of course with ""Tom Jones"" two years later. To add insult to injury Gig Young won the Oscar for this movie when it should of been her, York wouldn't be nominated again, and the big kicker: The movie that Goldie Hawn won the Oscar was for a comedy; which as you know the Academy (any wonder they put the word 'science' in it?) has a taboo track record for that genre. As you know the movie ends with (spoiler) Sarrazin's character killing Gloria (Fonda) with a bullet to the head from the gun that she took from Young's character. How ironic considering they let the audience remind them how John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy got killed during the 60's. And it ends with the dance marathon continuing on not revealing who wins the money; as it remind me of a cliche that I came up to decribe the movies during the 1960's: Nobody won.

Jane Fonda heads out the cast as a struggling actress who seeks out the dance marathon as a means of survival during the Great Depression. Marathons of this type were popular, luring in poor folks to see who would be willing to go so far to win a cash prize. Susannah York is another actress from Hollywood who has had her share of bad luck and it gets worse and worse as the marathon wears on. Red Buttons is a sailor who has seen his share of human loss and heartache but matters to almost nothing when he sees what this marathon will do to its contestants. Gig Young is well-cast as the scheming marathon promoter who loves to sit back and watch the people collapse and give up. He puts the show on soley for human spectacle and idiotic display. What he does to select contestants will have you loathing and seething with hatred for his character. He is so convincing in the role it won him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Young, who was a major comedy star back in the 1940-50's, was sinking into deep melancholy over life and his work and the Oscar did little to nothing to help him. In 1978 he shot his wife and then himself, always convinced that he was the result of an accidental pregnancy. However, despite this pitiful knowledge, he has given the entertainment world some of the best work we've ever seen, including his own TV show in the 50's in which he went behind the scenes of movies in production.This film was shot entirely in sequence and Pollack had his cast rehearse and dance for 12 straight hours before he put them in front of the camera, so you are basically seeing it as it was filmed. The editing makes it look more frenzied and more grueling to watch, especially those derby scenes. Human cruelty never looked more artistic or more disheartening. Dance marathons were eventually banned by law and this film shows just why that happened.Nominated for nine Academy Awards---Best Director (Pollack), Actress (Fonda), Supporting Actor (Gig Young, who won the Oscar), Supporting Actress (York), Screenplay Adaptation from the novel by Horace McCoy, Art Direction, Costume Design, Music Score Adaptation, and Film Editing. It is a travesty that it was not nominated for Best Picture. This is one of those little known films from the dusk of Hollywood's Golden Age and should not be missed. It should be revived for a whole new generation to discover and be mesmerized by.",5,One of the most overlooked classics from the 60's.,971740800,"10 17, 2000",2000,2780,"['Sydney', 'Pollack', 'given', 'world', 'most', 'memorable', 'engrossing', 'films', 'ever', 'such', 'quot', 'Way', 'Were', 'quot', 'quot', 'Out', 'Africa', 'quot', 'quot', 'Tootsie', 'quot', 'quot', 'Firm.', 'quot', 'However', 'most', 'seem', 'forget', 'little', 'masterpiece', 'helmed', 'back', '1969', 'dance', 'marathon', 'more', 'disillusionment', 'being', 'told', 'life', 'worthless', 'shame', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'out', 'cast', 'struggling', 'actress', 'who', 'out', 'dance', 'marathon', 'means', 'survival', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Marathons', 'type', 'were', 'popular', 'luring', 'poor', 'folks', 'see', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'win', 'cash', 'prize', 'Susannah', 'York', 'actress', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'had', 'share', 'bad', 'luck', 'worse', 'worse', 'marathon', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'sailor', 'who', 'seen', 'share', 'human', 'loss', 'heartache', 'matters', 'almost', 'nothing', 'when', 'what', 'marathon', 'will', 'do', 'contestants', 'Gig', 'Young', 'well-cast', 'scheming', 'marathon', 'promoter', 'who', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'people', 'collapse', 'give', 'up', 'show', 'soley', 'human', 'spectacle', 'idiotic', 'display', 'What', 'select', 'contestants', 'will', 'have', 'loathing', 'seething', 'hatred', 'character', 'so', 'convincing', 'role', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Young', 'who', 'was', 'major', 'comedy', 'star', 'back', '1940-50', 'was', 'sinking', 'deep', 'melancholy', 'life', 'work', 'Oscar', 'did', 'little', 'nothing', 'help', '1978', 'shot', 'wife', 'then', 'always', 'convinced', 'was', 'result', 'accidental', 'pregnancy', 'However', 'pitiful', 'knowledge', 'given', 'entertainment', 'world', 'best', 'work', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'including', 'own', 'TV', 'show', '50', 'went', 'scenes', 'movies', 'production.This', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'sequence', 'Pollack', 'had', 'cast', 'rehearse', 'dance', '12', 'straight', 'hours', 'put', 'front', 'camera', 'are', 'basically', 'seeing', 'was', 'filmed', 'editing', 'look', 'more', 'frenzied', 'more', 'grueling', 'watch', 'especially', 'derby', 'scenes', 'Human', 'cruelty', 'never', 'looked', 'more', 'artistic', 'more', 'disheartening', 'Dance', 'marathons', 'were', 'eventually', 'banned', 'law', 'film', 'just', 'why', 'happened.Nominated', 'nine', 'Academy', 'Awards', '-Best', 'Director', 'Pollack', 'Actress', 'Fonda', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Gig', 'Young', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'York', 'Screenplay', 'Adaptation', 'novel', 'Horace', 'McCoy', 'Art', 'Direction', 'Costume', 'Design', 'Music', 'Score', 'Adaptation', 'Film', 'Editing', 'travesty', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'one', 'little', 'known', 'films', 'dusk', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'should', 'be', 'revived', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'discover', 'be', 'mesmerized']","They Shoot Horses, Don't They?

396165,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,630401709X,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 3]","Well, this was the movie that in which Jane Fonda got serious and finally proved she could act.  At least, that's my memory of the hype that swirled about THEY SHOOT HORSES when it was released in 1969.  Of course, since her most recent project prior to this was BARBARELLA, almost anything would have seemed weighty by comparison. Jane had, as fans will tell you, done a few dramatic turns before, along with the romantic comedies she was perhaps best known for, but HORSES really did seem like a sea changer.  Emerging from her breakup with Roger Vadim, she was actively looking for ""serious"" projects, becoming newly politicized (if not yet radicalized) and beginning to identify herself with a 60s Zeitgeist that as a Hollywood (and Parisienne) starlet, was almost certainly alien (and therefore a little exotic) to her.Some may find a certain irony in the fact that the first hint of her embracing that 60s ""Zeitgeist"" proved to be a film set in the 1930s--and based on a novel from that era to boot.  But BONNIE AND CLYDE had already proven that the Depression era could serve as some kind of distorted(?) mirror image for the turbulent 60s.  Whatever the difference in the nation's economic picture between the two eras, they were both times when the validity of the American Dream was called into question.Very likely, the rapidly transforming Fonda identified with the anger and bitterness of her marathon dancing character Gloria.  What she apparently did not share, however, was her character's nihilism.  At this point in her life, Jane Fonda was embracing the possibility of personal fulfillment through political change, something her cynical character of 35 years previous would likely never have dreamed of.That was the beauty of the 60s, however, one man's (or woman's) cry of existential despair was another's political statement.  And both views could be legitimate takes on this film.  I was all of 17 when I first saw HORSES, so I found myself veering between both interpretations myself--alternately seeing it as a cry of despair and a call to arms.Nowadays, I lean more toward the former.  THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY seems to function better as a bleak commentary on the human condition than as a political manifesto.  Yes, the brutal--literally deadly--dance marathon can be viewed as the ultimate expression of capitalism's cruelty and exploitativeness.  But it's also, more likely, a metaphor for the above cited human condition itself, one in which no political solution is possible.  The claustrophobic setting (we only leave the actual dancehall in a few flashbacks and flashforwards) suggests as much.  This is not just life in Depression Era America.  This is LIFE.Take it or leave it.  Gloria ultimately opts for the latter.****************************I write this a few days after the death of one of Fonda's co-stars in this project.  Irnoically, while re-viewing this film last week, I found myself wondering if Red Buttons were still alive.  I just didn't know, even though I am usually pretty good at ""Dead or Alive"" quizzes.  His performance as an older participant in the marathon--initially full of spirit and then becming progressively more despairing--is a key element of the film.  Originally a comic actor, Buttons had already proven himself several times over as a dramatic one by this time (including an Oscar winning turn in SAYONARA).  Still, he was rarely better than he was in this film.  His was a heartbreaking performance, literally as well as figuratively.And I would be remiss not to mention the rest of the cast as well--all of whom were remarkable in their ways, even those like Bonnie Bedelia and Bruce Dern, who did not merit much actual screentime.  And the film was something of a high point in the careers of Susannah York and, especially, Gig Young, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Rocky, the jaded, but not entirely heartless, Master of Ceremonies.It was a role that the aging Young, the eternal second lead or otherwise, hoped would catapult him to a new career high, perhaps even true ""Gig Young film.""  He did win further acclaim in TV projects like THE NEON CEILING, but the Oscar Curse prevailed and his career stalled.  Ironically enough, given the subject matter of this, his most acclaimed film, he committed suicide less than a decade after its release.",4,Dance of Death,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,4351,"['Well', 'was', 'movie', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'got', 'serious', 'finally', 'proved', 'could', 'act', 'least', 'memory', 'hype', 'swirled', 'THEY', 'SHOOT', 'HORSES', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1969', 'course', 'most', 'recent', 'project', 'prior', 'was', 'BARBARELLA', 'almost', 'anything', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'weighty', 'comparison', 'Jane', 'had', 'fans', 'will', 'tell', 'done', 'few', 'dramatic', 'turns', 'before', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'was', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'HORSES', 'really', 'did', 'seem', 'sea', 'changer', 'Emerging', 'breakup', 'Roger', 'Vadim', 'was', 'actively', 'looking', 'serious', 'projects', 'becoming', 'newly', 'politicized', 'not', 'yet', 'radicalized', 'beginning', 'identify', '60s', 'Zeitgeist', 'Hollywood', 'Parisienne', 'starlet', 'was', 'almost', 'certainly', 'alien', 'therefore', 'little', 'exotic', 'her.Some', 'may', 'find', 'certain', 'irony', 'fact', 'first', 'hint', 'embracing', '60s', 'Zeitgeist', 'proved', 'be', 'film', 'set', '1930s', 'based', 'novel', 'era', 'boot', 'BONNIE', 'AND', 'CLYDE', 'had', 'already', 'proven', 'Depression', 'era', 'could', 'serve', 'kind', 'distorted', 'mirror', 'image', 'turbulent', '60s', 'difference', 'nation', 'economic', 'picture', 'two', 'eras', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'validity', 'American', 'Dream', 'was', 'called', 'question.Very', 'likely', 'rapidly', 'transforming', 'Fonda', 'identified', 'anger', 'bitterness', 'marathon', 'dancing', 'character', 'Gloria', 'What', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'share', 'however', 'was', 'character', 'nihilism', 'point', 'life', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'was', 'embracing', 'possibility', 'personal', 'fulfillment', 'political', 'change', 'something', 'cynical', 'character', '35', 'years', 'previous', 'would', 'likely', 'never', 'have', 'dreamed', 'was', 'beauty', '60s', 'however', 'one', 'man', 'woman', 'cry', 'existential', 'despair', 'was', 'political', 'statement', 'views', 'could', 'be', 'legitimate', 'film', 'was', '17', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'HORSES', 'found', 'veering', 'interpretations', 'alternately', 'seeing', 'cry', 'despair', 'call', 'arms.Nowadays', 'lean', 'more', 'former', 'THEY', 'SHOOT', 'HORSES', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'THEY', 'function', 'better', 'bleak', 'commentary', 'human', 'condition', 'political', 'manifesto', 'Yes', 'brutal', 'literally', 'deadly', 'dance', 'marathon', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'ultimate', 'expression', 'capitalism', 'cruelty', 'exploitativeness', 'also', 'more', 'likely', 'metaphor', 'above', 'cited', 'human', 'condition', 'one', 'political', 'solution', 'possible', 'claustrophobic', 'setting', 'only', 'leave', 'actual', 'dancehall', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'flashforwards', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'just', 'life', 'Depression', 'Era', 'America', 'LIFE.Take', 'leave', 'Gloria', 'ultimately', 'latter', 'write', 'few', 'days', 'death', 'one', 'Fonda', 'co-stars', 'project', 'Irnoically', 're-viewing', 'film', 'last', 'week', 'found', 'wondering', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'even', 'am', 'usually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'quizzes', 'performance', 'older', 'participant', 'marathon', 'initially', 'full', 'spirit', 'then', 'becming', 'progressively', 'more', 'despairing', 'key', 'element', 'film', 'Originally', 'comic', 'actor', 'Buttons', 'had', 'already', 'proven', 'several', 'times', 'dramatic', 'one', 'time', 'including', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'turn', 'SAYONARA', 'Still', 'was', 'rarely', 'better', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'literally', 'as', 'well', 'figuratively.And', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'not', 'mention', 'rest', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'whom', 'were', 'remarkable', 'ways', 'even', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'merit', 'much', 'actual', 'screentime', 'film', 'was', 'something', 'high', 'point', 'careers', 'Susannah', 'York', 'especially', 'Gig', 'Young', 'who', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Rocky', 'jaded', 'not', 'entirely', 'heartless', 'Master', 'Ceremonies.It', 'was', 'role', 'aging', 'Young', 'eternal', 'second', 'lead', 'otherwise', 'hoped', 'would', 'catapult', 'new', 'career', 'high', 'perhaps', 'even', 'true', 'Gig', 'Young', 'film', 'did', 'win', 'further', 'acclaim', 'TV', 'projects', 'THE', 'NEON', 'CEILING', 'Oscar', 'Curse', 'prevailed', 'career', 'stalled', 'Ironically', 'enough', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'committed', 'suicide', 'less', 'decade', 'release']","They Shoot Horses, Don't They?

To dance and dance without limit of time.Since its release, it became a cult movie.

396167,A5ZJFVV0564T6,630401709X,"Ilona Novotny ""Eccentric""","[30, 31]","In this age of ""Reality"" TV shows like ""Survivor"",  in which ""The Most Devious and Unscrupulous Person Wins"" for a grand prize of a million dollars, the grim reality of the Great Depression makes inconsequential dreck like this look like a walk in the park.  Sydney Pollack's ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"", based on the novella by Horace McCoy, is a harrowing heartbreaking , and unforgettable experience. Set in Southern California in 1932, ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" is the tale of a marathon dance, and the desperate people who participate in it.  For those of you who don't know what a marathon dance was, couples had to dance for 2 hours, take a 10 minute break to sleep or eat, and then dance again....and again...and again. These grueling endurance contests went on for weeks, and the last remaining couple on the dance floor would win the Grand Prize...if they were still alive and/or still conscious enough to claim it....while spectators watched the whole grotesque show.Jane Fonda (in the performance of her career, IMO) plays Gloria Beatty, an embittered young woman who has had more than her fair share of hard knocks. Her dance partner is the dreamy-eyed and nave country boy Robert Syverton (Michael Sarrazin), Among the other contestants are a flinty, middle-aged sailor (Red Buttons), aspiring actress Alice LeBlanc (Susannah York) and her partner  Joel (Robert Fields), and hayseed couple James and Ruby (Bruce Dern and Bonnie Bedelia). Presiding over the dance is the cynical emcee Rocky (Gig Young, in an Oscar-winning performance) The action of the film covers the weeks that transpire during the dance, and the physical, emotional, and mental toll that it takes on the contestants is, quite simply, horrifying. These people were struggling for their lives, when just the prospect of having a meal was a very precious thing, not to mention a job, a home, some self-respect. Dreams are shattered, someone dies during this hellish dance (Red Buttons' death scene, from a massive heart attack during ""The Derby"", a grueling track race, is unforgettable), and Alice LeBlanc, whose somewhat fragile grip on reality finally gives way, finally loses her mind. And there's still more to come, folks!The performances are top-notch and disturbingly believable. Jane Fonda's performance isn't merely a performance...it's a fist in your face. Gig Young isn't merely smarmy, he's just someone who has seen it all, and who probably cant muster up any sorrow anymore. The supporting cast is great, including Allyn Mclerie ,  Michael Conrad, Al ""Grandpa Munster"" Lewis, Madge Kennedy, and Paul Mantee. Director Pollack wisely shot the film in sequence, and the actors look like they've been to Hell (and not necessarily back) by the film's end. The production and costumes are very accurate, (tho the men's hairstyles belie the year in which the film was made, 1969, they're not quite accurate for the 1930s), the music is not only correct, but the choice of songs is quite poignant indeed (""The Best Things in Life are Free"", ""I Found a Million Dollar Baby in a Five and Ten Cent Store"").The picture and sound quality on the DVD are excellent, and the film is presented in its correct widescreen format. Sadly, there are no extras on the DVD, which is a pity.This is a must-see film for people seeking to see true-to-life drama, and it is also a reminder of how fortunate we are these days. My parents lived through the Depression as children, and they were not easy times.

It's filled with mistakes, from the beginning to the ending. The movie is supposed to take place in Hollywood, but no movie star is introduced to the dancers in the audience. The movie is supposed to take place in a closed room, where passions should break out; but there is no fighting, not a single fight, as McCoy's novel is filled with them. The movie is supposed to take place in a dancing hall, but we can't see any public bar. The movie is supposed to take place in the 30's; but we don't see any cops or gangsters. The public wedding sequence has disappeared, and Gloria, played by very glamour Jane Fonda, loses a lot of her mystery; she never gives us the feeling that she wants to die, she only curses and groans and says things like 'I can't sleep, I'm too tired'; so in the end, when she asks Robert to shoot her in the head, it's more shocking than anything else and it doesn't make much sense.Some other stupid stuff: in McCoy's novel, Mrs. Layden gets killed in the end. In the movie she's not, so we can wonder why she doesn't come to Robert and try to help him, during the trial. But the most enormous thing is that derby track that is rectangular, instead of being oval. It's totally ridiculous! Despite all those mistakes the movie works rather well, but I think it's quite overrated. When I saw it for the first time I was greatly disappointed. I expected to discover a great ""noir"" movie as good as the novel, maybe better, but I saw just an academic, overcolored, clean, well-thinking melodrama filled with nonsense, in the Hollywood style. Pollack's biggest mistake is to have taken a short novel and put all its strongest elements away (especially the sequence of the public wedding or the one showing Gloria facing the two women from the Mothers' League). Unforgivable.

396170,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,630401709X,Jeff  Farrow,"[2, 2]","THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY? was first released near the end of the 60's era of social revolt. The pre-revolutionary, Anti-War, Feminist ideals were co-opted  by a slick Liberalism. This atmosphere was well expressed in the witty, Norman Lear television concoctions like ""Maud,"" ""The Jeffersons"" and ""All in The Family."" These shows had their moments of high hilarity--and, more importantly, they helped usher in a more racially integrated & aware entertainment media. As good as they might be, there was an uncomfortable, unreality to the shows. The more they tried to tie in ""socially relevant"" themes, the more artificial they appeared. Viewing ""Maude"" today is a little embarrassing.The world of cinema fares better in retrospection. It was the era of the European ""Art House"" film, and many of these movies have survied the test of time. The American THEY SHOOT HORSES is very much in that tradition--with a strong flavor of Hollywood, of course. Jane Fonda was riding a wave of popularity at the time, and taking the role of Gloria, the down-on-her-luck, hard times girl posed a challenge--one that she was up to taking on. Gloria is an anti-heroine. She has been beaten down so long her consistent negative view of reality is almost funny. When she finally realizes just how hopeless & really terrible her situation is, she just spits out ""Perfect.""Gig Young received many positive reviews for his portrayal of the Machiavellian director of the Dance Marathon. There is complexity to his characterization. On one level he is just a manipulating pitch man, doing whatever it takes to stay afloat in the Depression era. But once in a while you see a slight tremble of sympathy for the losers he manipilates both in front of the stage lights & behind the scenes.The real killer performance for me is song & dance man Red Buttons. He plays an aging ex-sailor, passed over for promotion, probably discharged without distinction. He still wears his sailor suit, probably as a sop for the audience in the peanut gallery who throw pennies at the dancers who strike their fancy. He is so pathetic in his willingness to do whatever he thinks it will take to stay in the game--both on & off stage. His performance is heart-breaking.One of the more horrific scenes is when the dancers are forced to take part in a roller skating race. Bruce Dern & Bonnie Bedelia are a young married couple who are at the end of their rope financially like everybody else--except she is pregnant. During the skating race the camera does facial close-ups as the already exhausted players have to ratchet up the tension 100%. The faces of Bedilia and Red Buttons are portraits in agony. She looks like she's miscarrying & Buttons' character is, in fact, in the process of stroking out.The audience, of course, represents a strata of society that for the most part is only a little better off than the dancers. Some are smug, others patronizing. They can be seen as the liberals of the 70's--wanting to appear in control & gracious, but whose inner realities were often murky, sometimes condescending, always needing the veneer of progressive ideals & social acceptance in order to mask less than altruistic motivations.*************************************************THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY? recalls to mind a Joni Mitchel song, THE BANQUET:Come to the dinner gongThe table is laden highFat bellies & hungry little onesTuck your napkins in & take your shareSome get the gravySome get the gristleSome get the marrow boneAnd some get nothingThough there's plenty to share.",4,Plenty to Share?,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,3555,"['THEY', 'SHOOT', 'HORSES', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'THEY', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'end', '60', 'era', 'social', 'revolt', 'pre-revolutionary', 'Anti-War', 'Feminist', 'ideals', 'were', 'co-opted', 'slick', 'Liberalism', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'well', 'expressed', 'witty', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'television', 'concoctions', 'Maud', 'Jeffersons', 'Family', 'shows', 'had', 'moments', 'high', 'hilarity', 'more', 'importantly', 'helped', 'usher', 'more', 'racially', 'integrated', 'aware', 'entertainment', 'media', 'As', 'good', 'might', 'be', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'unreality', 'shows', 'more', 'tried', 'tie', 'socially', 'relevant', 'themes', 'more', 'artificial', 'appeared', 'Viewing', 'Maude', 'today', 'little', 'embarrassing.The', 'world', 'cinema', 'fares', 'better', 'retrospection', 'was', 'era', 'European', 'Art', 'House', 'film', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'survied', 'test', 'time', 'American', 'THEY', 'SHOOT', 'HORSES', 'very', 'much', 'tradition', 'strong', 'flavor', 'Hollywood', 'course', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'was', 'riding', 'wave', 'popularity', 'time', 'taking', 'role', 'Gloria', 'down-on-her-luck', 'hard', 'times', 'girl', 'posed', 'challenge', 'one', 'was', 'up', 'taking', 'Gloria', 'anti-heroine', 'been', 'beaten', 'down', 'so', 'long', 'consistent', 'negative', 'view', 'reality', 'almost', 'funny', 'When', 'finally', 'just', 'how', 'hopeless', 'really', 'terrible', 'situation', 'just', 'out', 'Perfect', 'Gig', 'Young', 'received', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'portrayal', 'Machiavellian', 'director', 'Dance', 'Marathon', 'complexity', 'characterization', 'one', 'level', 'just', 'manipulating', 'pitch', 'man', 'doing', 'whatever', 'stay', 'afloat', 'Depression', 'era', 'once', 'while', 'see', 'slight', 'tremble', 'sympathy', 'losers', 'front', 'stage', 'lights', 'scenes.The', 'real', 'killer', 'performance', 'song', 'dance', 'man', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'aging', 'ex-sailor', 'passed', 'promotion', 'probably', 'discharged', 'distinction', 'still', 'sailor', 'suit', 'probably', 'sop', 'audience', 'peanut', 'gallery', 'who', 'throw', 'pennies', 'dancers', 'who', 'strike', 'fancy', 'so', 'pathetic', 'willingness', 'do', 'whatever', 'will', 'take', 'stay', 'game', 'off', 'stage', 'performance', 'heart-breaking.One', 'more', 'horrific', 'scenes', 'when', 'dancers', 'are', 'forced', 'take', 'part', 'roller', 'skating', 'race', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'are', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'end', 'rope', 'financially', 'everybody', 'else', 'pregnant', 'skating', 'race', 'camera', 'facial', 'close-ups', 'already', 'exhausted', 'players', 'have', 'ratchet', 'up', 'tension', '100', '%', 'Bedilia', 'Red', 'Buttons', 'are', 'portraits', 'agony', 'miscarrying', 'Buttons', 'character', 'fact', 'process', 'stroking', 'out.The', 'audience', 'course', 'strata', 'society', 'most', 'part', 'only', 'little', 'better', 'dancers', 'are', 'smug', 'others', 'patronizing', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'liberals', '70', 'wanting', 'appear', 'control', 'gracious', 'inner', 'realities', 'were', 'often', 'murky', 'sometimes', 'condescending', 'always', 'needing', 'veneer', 'progressive', 'ideals', 'social', 'acceptance', 'order', 'mask', 'less', 'altruistic', 'motivations', '*************************************************THEY', 'SHOOT', 'HORSES', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'THEY', 'recalls', 'mind', 'Joni', 'Mitchel', 'song', 'THE', 'BANQUET', 'Come', 'dinner', 'gongThe', 'table', 'laden', 'highFat', 'bellies', 'hungry', 'little', 'napkins', 'take', 'shareSome', 'get', 'gravySome', 'get', 'gristleSome', 'get', 'marrow', 'get', 'plenty', 'share']","They Shoot Horses, Don't They?

396171,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,630401709X,Jeffrey Leach,"[3, 4]","The Great Depression, always written with capital letters to denote the seriousness of the event, led to great problems far beyond our borders. One of the causes of the Second World War originated in a Germany plagued by economic problems far worse than what America went through. But things were bad here, too. Although far more people kept their jobs than ones who didn't, millions of Americans queued up in soup lines, wandered the country in search of work, and couldn't pay their bills. The New Deal, despite the fawning adoration these policies receive today, did little to alleviate economic woes in the long term. Some turned to crime to make ends meet, hence the rise of Dillinger and the other famous bank robbers, but some resorted to competing in particularly grotesque public spectacles referred to as dance marathons. A grinding trial of endurance for participants, dance marathons saw couples signing up to dance for extended periods of time, sometimes up to a month or longer with only short breaks for food and sleep, in order to win a bundle of money. Audiences showed up to watch, bet on, and cheer these unfortunate wretches. Fortunately, states eventually passed laws banning these scurrilous events.""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" is a cinematic adaptation of a Horace McCoy novella of the same name. The star of the picture is Gloria (Jane Fonda), a world-weary young lady who signs up for the latest contest because she has nothing left to live for. Needing a partner, she spies a shy young fellow named Robert (Michael Sarrazin) watching the proceedings from a distance and convinces him to join up as her dance mate. Competition looks fierce, though. Sailor (Red Buttons) and his partner Shirl (Allyn Ann McLerie) look like they might put out some effort despite their advanced age. So do James (Bruce Dern) and his wife Ruby (Bonnie Bedelia) who, although pregnant, helped her man win a contest in another state. One individual who definitely looks like she won't make it is glamour girl Alice (Susannah York), whose interest lies in dolling herself up like a movie star in order to draw attention from any potential talent agents in the audience. Presiding over this gladiatorial madness is the cynical emcee Rocky (Gig Young). He stands at a microphone on the stage belting out hour after hour of running commentary on the contestants, inventing wild stories about their backgrounds in order to pump up the audience. His sole purpose in life is to put on a good show, and he won't allow any of the dancers to do anything that jeopardizes that goal.Once the contest begins, what follows is an experience that leaves the viewer as emotionally and physically drained as the contestants. Hours turn into days, days into weeks as the participants grind away on the dance floor. Couples start to slip away, either quitting and walking off voluntarily or collapsing in a heap on the floor. Tensions pull the dancers apart, with new couplings made, broken, and reformed as time goes by. When attendance starts to lag, Rocky and his cohorts, including Al Lewis and Michael Conrad as Turkey and Rollo respectively, institute a fun new game, the Derby. This barbaric ritual requires the surviving contenders to trot madly around the outer edge of the dance floor, with the woman holding on to the man's belt, in a heel and toe race of exhausting dimensions. It's a nifty way to fire up the crowds as well as pare down the number of couples. It's also one of the sickest things you're likely to see in a film. No wonder that Gloria begins to lose all hope of ever emerging from the hole that constitutes her existence. Her exchanges with Rocky take on unsavory aspects as she fervently attempts to stay in the game. It's almost as though she senses what her fate must be if she fails to win the prize. When she finally learns the truth behind the dance contest, she must make a decision of life and death importance for both her and Robert.Every performer with significant screen time turns in a stellar performance. It's Hanoi Jane and Gig Young that steal the show, though. I hate to admit it considering her unofficial status as a traitor to the country that allowed her to live in comfort her entire life, but Fonda really drives it home with her portrayal of the exhausted Gloria. The bitterness in her eyes and her icy tones convincingly convey the impression of a human being dangling at the end of her shattered life. Just as good, if not better, is Gig Young. His is a more challenging part in that he must simultaneously express the mentality of a ruthless self-promoter while occasionally showing us his concern for the contestants, and even then you're never quite sure whether he provides comfort because of a kind heart or whether it's just another ploy to keep the show going. Whatever the case his scene with a delusional Alice ranks as among the best in a movie loaded with unforgettable moments. The talent aside, ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" works so well because the film uses the cruelty of the dance marathon as a metaphor for the callous disregard people show for the less fortunate.I'm slightly disappointed with the MGM DVD version. The only extra on the disc is a trailer, surprising considering how many Academy Awards this film won the year it came out. I've heard of an earlier Anchor Bay release with better audio and better extras, so hopefully that disc or a similar version will receive a reissue at some point in the future. I find it difficult to believe Hanoi Jane wouldn't want to do a commentary for the film, unless she's one of those people who refuse to comment about her work. I recommend both the film and McCoy's searing novella.",5,Soul shattering,1105660800,"01 14, 2005",2005,5695,"['Great', 'Depression', 'always', 'written', 'capital', 'letters', 'denote',

Michael Click,"[4, 4]","Movie: ***** DVD Transfer: ***** DVD Extras: **Impeccable performances distinguish this penetrating examination of Depression-era America in which a dance marathon acts as a microcosm of the world for the desperate contestants and the calculating producers of the event.  Jane Fonda's breakthrough performance as the cynical and embittered Gloria is the centerpiece of the film; the actress is nothing short of brilliant as she creates a character who is completely unsentimental and largely unsympathetic, but nonetheless humanly understandable.  Fonda's wrenching tour de force is ably supported by a great cast of professionals all performing at the peak of their abilities, including Susannah York as a would-be starlet desperate to be discovered (her final scene is gut-wrenching); Michael Sarrazin as the drifter who becomes Fonda's dancing partner through a twist of fate; Bonnie Bedelia and Bruce Dern as a hard-luck couple trying to beat the odds; Michael Conrad and Al (""Grandpa Munster"") Lewis as employees of the marathon; and especially, Gig Young in his Oscar-winning turn as the marathon's sardonic and manipulative emcee.Also of note are the film's remarkable achievements in makeup and editing.  The majority of the action takes place in one location over a period of several weeks, with the characters slowly losing their vitality and letting their appearances go as exhaustion and numbness set in.  The makeup artists and wardrobe team did a fantastic job of providing visual continuity for the stars and many extras over the film's nearly two-hour running time; no small feat there!  And the razor-sharp editing contributes enormously to the film's pace, alternating lengthy stretches of dialogue and inaction with bravura, manic sequences in which rapid cuts create the impression of a society run amok.The new MGM Home Video of this neglected gem offers clean, sharp video and crisp sound.  Viewed on a 57"" widescreen monitor, my copy looked and sounded perfect; especially effective were the scenes at the beginning of the film when a series of startling reports resembled the sound of a gun being fired.  The extras include only the Original Theatrical Trailer - which is a treat - but leaves the curious viewer wanting more.  I would have really loved an audio commentary by the surviving cast members and the director, or at least some filmed interview clips.  This is a fascinating film that deserves the deluxe treatment, but until that happens, this edition is well worth adding to your collection.",4,"But how did they shoot ""Horses"" ?",1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,2527,"['Movie', '*****', 'DVD', 'Transfer', '*****', 'DVD', 'Extras', '**Impeccable', 'performances', 'distinguish', 'penetrating', 'examination', 'Depression-era', 'America', 'dance', 'marathon', 'microcosm', 'world', 'desperate', 'contestants', 'calculating', 'producers', 'event', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'cynical', 'embittered', 'Gloria', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'actress', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'character', 'who', 'completely', 'unsentimental', 'largely', 'unsympathetic', 'nonetheless', 'humanly', 'understandable', 'Fonda', 'wrenching', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'ably', 'supported', 'great', 'cast', 'professionals', 'performing', 'peak', 'abilities', 'including', 'Susannah', 'York', 'would-be', 'starlet', 'desperate', 'be', 'discovered', 'final', 'scene', 'gut-wrenching', 'Michael', 'Sarrazin', 'drifter', 'who', 'Fonda', 'dancing', 'partner', 'twist', 'fate', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'hard-luck', 'couple', 'trying', 'beat', 'odds', 'Michael', 'Conrad', 'Al', 'Grandpa', 'Munster', 'Lewis', 'employees', 'marathon', 'especially', 'Gig', 'Young', 'Oscar-winning', 'turn', 'marathon', 'sardonic', 'manipulative', 'emcee.Also', 'note', 'are', 'film', 'remarkable', 'achievements', 'makeup', 'editing', 'majority', 'action', 'place', 'one', 'location', 'period', 'several', 'weeks', 'characters', 'slowly', 'losing', 'vitality', 'letting', 'appearances', 'go', 'exhaustion', 'numbness', 'set', 'makeup', 'artists', 'wardrobe', 'team', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'providing', 'visual', 'continuity', 'stars', 'many', 'extras', 'film', 'nearly', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'small', 'feat', 'razor-sharp', 'editing', 'enormously', 'film', 'pace', 'alternating', 'lengthy', 'stretches', 'dialogue', 'inaction', 'bravura', 'manic', 'sequences', 'rapid', 'cuts', 'create', 'impression', 'society', 'run', 'amok.The', 'new', 'MGM', 'Home', 'Video', 'neglected', 'gem', 'offers', 'clean', 'sharp', 'video', 'crisp', 'sound', 'Viewed', '57', 'widescreen', 'monitor', 'copy', 'looked', 'sounded', 'perfect', 'especially', 'effective', 'were', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'film', 'when', 'series', 'startling', 'reports', 'resembled', 'sound', 'gun', 'being', 'fired', 'extras', 'include', 'only', 'Original', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'treat', 'curious', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'loved', 'audio', 'commentary', 'surviving', 'cast', 'members', 'director', 'least', 'filmed', 'interview', 'clips', 'fascinating', 'film', 'deluxe', 'treatment', 'edition', 'well', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection']","They Shoot Horses, Don't They?

Couples who have neither money nor hope will compete for a prize of $1500 by dancing the longest - virtually non-stop.  We get to know and empathize with several couples as they dance for hours, days, and even weeks before a strange crowd of spectators who throw pennies and cheer for the ""show.""  Bitter and tired-of-life Gloria (Jane Fonda) is paired with Robert (Michael Sarrazin), a wide-eyed innocent from the country.  The marathon is incredibly grueling and dehumanizing, and that's just the way the manic host (Oscar winner Gig Young) likes it.This is a fascinating look at the dance marathons that really took place during the Depression, when people were willing to risk their health (and their lives) for the meals that were provided and a chance at the money.  Each of the dancers we meet is unique, sympathetic, and believable.  Fonda gives a masterful performance as the hopeless Gloria.  At the end, she utters the wonderful and haunting title line.  Sarrazin is good, but doesn't quite have the star quality that Fonda does.It's a sad film that brings to mind the days when bored Romans watched bloodied gladiators fight to the death.  The story is fittingly left unresolved,  just like the bleak lives of the contestants.  I recommend this outstanding film, directed by Sydney Pollack.Kona",5,""" It isn't a contest.  It's a show.

Gig Young did win for Best Supporting Actor, though, and this is one of director Sydney Pollack's most memorable films. It is adapted from the 1935 novel of the same name by Horace McCoy. In California of 1932, the seaside Pacific Ballroom holds a dance marathon in which couples compete for a $1500 prize. After her partner is rejected for health reasons, tough-talking Gloria Beatty (Jane Fonda) reluctantly accepts Robert Syverton (Michael Sarrazin) as a replacement. Robert just happened to come in off the street and was conscripted by the marathon's business-minded emcee Rocky (Gig Young).These days, dance marathons are charity events that last only a couple of days. But they were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s. These were not typical ballroom dancing contests. They were brutal endurance competitions for which the spectators paid good money to watch people suffer. Dancers got a 10-minute break every 2 hours, during which they slept, free food, but they had to eat it while standing and dancing, and the marathon went on for weeks for months. Last couple standing wins. They were especially popular during the Great Depression, because they offered free food and shelter, and a chance for unemployed Americans to win some money, as we see in the homeless couple James (Bruce Dern) and his pregnant wife Ruby (Bonnie Bedelia).It's a fine ensemble cast, but at the emotional core are the equally cynical Gloria and Rocky, a young woman at the end of her rope and an older man who couldn't care less at this point in his life. Both strong characters but neither of them likable, because they treat others so poorly. It is a credit to the actors and director that this doesn't make them completely unsympathetic. Like them or not, we understand where Gloria and Rocky are coming from. That the monotony of the marathon and film's pessimistic tone are, themselves, unforgettable rather than stultifying is due to Pollack's skill. Like Rocky, he knows when to ratchet it up to keep the audience's attention.When Horace McCoy's novel was published in France, it was embraced by the Existentialist school of thought as an absurdist perspective on the human condition. As it was written and takes place during the 1930s, it struck me as a leftist comment on the American rat race and perceived indifference of the capitalist economy to its human cost. The film is socio-political commentary, but its overwhelming theme is simply pessimism. The dance marathon is a microcosm of the human experience, and it is ugly. Losers and winners alike are chewed up. But the behavior is interesting, and that's what keeps the audience glued to the screen with our faces stuck in a grimace.

396184,A2VXQL36IFQGKZ,630401709X,RALPH PETERS,"[50, 54]","I was overjoyed to receive a gift of the reissue of this video in 1995, that is until I watched it in all its &quot;pan &amp; scan&quot; desecration.  It is truly a joy to watch this DVD (VHS is now available in  widescreen as well) in the right format with all the extras.  But all that  aside, this is a towering, neglected masterpiece of American cinema that  virtually put director Sydney Pollack on the map and established Jane Fonda  as the premier American actress of the Sixties and Seventies.  Who else  could have captured the tragic essence of the bitter, beaten Gloria but  Fonda?  Watch her especially in the final elimination round as she  desperately (and literally) carries her ailing partner around the floor in  a final attempt to win the big prize and (symbolically) maybe give life one  more try.  Fonda never sentimalizes this great character as a lesser  actress would have been tempted to; no simple answers or easy forgiveness  will do for Gloria--she is too important to be trivialized.  Red Buttons,  Susannah York, and Gig Young are also superb in supporting roles; the  cinematography and music also deserve kudos.  If you haven't seen it, do  not miss this American classic and one of the century's greatest actresses  just entering her prime.

You cannot come away from this film without being moved by its amazing, thought-provoking power. The world created by Pollack draws you in so completely (along with brilliant sets, cinematography, editing and, especially, the very well-chosen music) that you cannot help thinking &quot;There but for the grace of God, Go I&quot;. What many don't realize is that this film is on the record books of the Academy for many reasons; no other film received as many Oscar nominations as this (9) without being nominated for Best Picture. Two artists who have made unforgettable marks upon the history of American film (Pollack and Fonda) received their first of many Oscar nominations. As I mentioned, there's not much more to say about this film experience that hasn't been said, though I will repeat: SEE THIS FILM. If you're any kind of a film fan, this is an essential addition to your library.The Widescreen version and DVD are 2.35:1, the ONLY way to view this film.

As the defiantly self-destructive, sharp-tongued Gloria, Jane Fonda gives a startling strong performance. Although she is somewhat repellent, her playing makes the audience feel empathy for her character: an affecting performance. The ultimately tragic Gig Young won his long awaited AA for his portrait of the crude barker; his pitches on the mike cheapen every human emotion, yet paradoxically, he's also sensitive and empathic. The director, Sydney Pollack, isn't exactly inventive, but he holds a tight rein over his actors; they work well for him, and he keeps the grisly situation going with energy and drive.

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[3, 3]","THEY SHOOT HORSES DON'T THEY? is a skillfully acted motion picture that brings a desperate seedy side of 1930's Hollywood/Santa Monica back to life with close attention to detail.  The setting is an ocean front dance hall the viewer presumes is in Santa Monica or some other nearby beach town and many of the participants in the dance marathon held there are Hollywood hopefuls.  Aside from possibly catching the attention of a movie casting agent the dancers stay in the long grueling marathon for hope of winning a $1500 prize (split between the dancing partners) and free food and shelter during their short breaks when they are not swaying on the dance floor to entertain the ghoulish spectators who throw pennies at their favorite participants.The movie has many capable actors and Gig Young is the most impressive in his role of Rocky the manipulative M.C. of the marathon.  Jane Fonda is very good as the bitter cynical Gloria though she gives Gloria way too much tenacity for life to make me believe that she would end up as the movie portrays.  Susannah York is also very good as a British Jean Harlow type who wants to make it big in Hollywood as is Red Buttons as ""the ancient mariner"" a fiftyish sailor who is much much older than the rest of the ""kids"" and whose amazing stamina can only hold up so long.  I had more trouble believing in Gloria's dance partner  ""Robbie"" as played by Michael Sarrazin who is the shooter of the title and who never came across as an authentic character to me.  Other famous names in the film include Bonnie Bedalia as the pregnant ""Okie"" Ruby,  Bruce Dern as Ruby's husband, Al Lewis from THE MUNSTERS as a worker at the dance hall and Michael Conrad of Hill Street Blues fame playing a marathon referee.The movie is set in 1932 and was released in 1969 just thirty-seven years later.
