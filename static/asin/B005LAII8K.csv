The premise of this film is very interesting - and in case you don't get it, there's a handy narrative by the young version of our hero. The topic of messing with the time continuum and changing outcomes has been explored many times, and here it is again - taking a look at the balance between personal desire and moral integrity. So that's all good and was entertaining to watch.The plot, however, seemed to lumber along. There was a lack of continuity in the characters. As a viewer I couldn't decide whom I was supposed to like - the young hero, the old hero, the woman, the child-turn-monster. Just when you settle into an emotional track, the plot takes a strange turn. So overall, this movie left me disconcerted rather than fully satisfied.Now you might say - ah, that's an intelligent film! But no - it wasn't intelligence that was disconcerting but rather bumpy story telling. Ol' Bruce played a full spectrum of emotions from total bad-ass killer to sensitive husband and father. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's nose was brilliantly matched to Bruce Willis'. Jeff Daniels put forth some really good character development.So in essence, should you watch the movie? Sure! It's different, it'll keep you on your toes. There is some really gruesome stuff, some interesting stuff. Is it brilliant?

1483723,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B005LAII8K,Andre Dursin,"[28, 40]","In Rian Johnson's latest film, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a ""looper,"" a hitman named Joe in 2044 Kansas City where time travel has been invented - and outlawed - and nearly 10% of the world's population has developed a telekenetic mutation. That hasn't stopped crime bosses from sending their targets back from the future, where Gordon-Levitt and other loopers dispose of their bodies so they can't be tracked. The loopers themselves become their own targets after their contract runs out 30 years after the fact - something that becomes a problem when Gordon-Levitt's future self (Bruce Willis) manages to escape from his assassination, and tries to convince his younger incarnation that the world is going to be destroyed if a crime boss dubbed ""The Rainmaker"" is able to have his way.Johnson's picture is most effective during its first half. Working with a modest budget, ""Looper"" mixes the familiar with the futuristic in a dirty, dank environment, and the movie's use of time travel eschews standard genre devices - at one point, Willis' character even tells Gordon-Levitt to stop thinking about past/present ""space-time continuum"" rifts, as if to urge the audience not to get hung up on technical details (in this movie, unlike ""Back to the Future,"" changing the past doesn't erase one's future existence, but rather clouds over one's memories). The story, though, shifts gears completely in its second hour, with Gordon-Levitt's younger protagonist venturing onto a farm, encountering a young mother (Emily Blunt) and her son while Willis' older half searches for the child that will eventually become ""The Rainmaker.""It's during the movie's later section when ""Looper"" loses its momentum and asks the audience to shift gears into something resembling a remake of ""Firestarter"" - something that comes off as unexpected and not entirely satisfying. The movie never regains the forward narrative thrust of its first half, and is also hampered by characters who are almost completely unlikeable - Gordon-Levitt's distracting make-up also doesn't seem to have been entirely necessary, as the actor would've been capable enough to mimic Willis' persona with less prosthetic involved. Willis himself is fine, and Emily Blunt does believable work as the child's mother, but none of them are particularly engaging or sympathetic. Johnson's script also, frustratingly, dangles questions in front of viewers without making a strong enough connection to whether or not they make sense dramatically (as it's impossible to go into these aspects without spoiling the plot, I won't comment any further, but they partially involve the picture's ending). It's one thing to be ambiguous, but it's another when the dots are so weakly connected that the suggestion of certain concepts seems to come out of thin air due to a lack of development.""Looper,"" then, is a cold and unusual film - less a ""groundbreaking"" genre picture than it is an interesting B-movie with intriguing elements but something fundamentally lacking in its center.""Looper""'s Blu-Ray includes over 20 deleted scenes (17 of which are exclusive to the format), featurettes (including a profile of the scoring by Nathan Johnson), commentary from Rian Johnson, Gordon-Levitt and Blunt, plus a BD exclusive ""Sci",3,Fascinating But The Dots Don't Entirely Connect,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,3265,"['Rian', 'Johnson', 'latest', 'film', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'looper', 'hitman', 'named', 'Joe', '2044', 'Kansas', 'City', 'where', 'time', 'travel', 'been', 'invented', 'outlawed', 'nearly', '10', '%', 'world', 'population', 'developed', 'telekenetic', 'mutation', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'crime', 'bosses', 'sending', 'targets', 'back', 'future', 'where', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'other', 'loopers', 'dispose', 'bodies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'tracked', 'loopers', 'become', 'own', 'targets', 'contract', 'out', '30', 'years', 'fact', 'something', 'problem', 'when', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'future', 'self', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'escape', 'assassination', 'tries', 'convince', 'younger', 'incarnation', 'world', 'going', 'be', 'destroyed', 'crime', 'boss', 'dubbed', 'Rainmaker', 'able', 'have', 'way.Johnson', 'picture', 'most', 'effective', 'first', 'half', 'Working', 'modest', 'budget', 'Looper', 'mixes', 'familiar', 'futuristic', 'dirty', 'dank', 'environment', 'movie', 'use', 'time', 'travel', 'eschews', 'standard', 'genre', 'devices', 'one', 'point', 'Willis', 'character', 'even', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'stop', 'thinking', 'past/present', 'space-time', 'continuum', 'rifts', 'urge', 'audience', 'not', 'get', 'hung', 'up', 'technical', 'details', 'movie', 'Back', 'Future', 'changing', 'past', ""n't"", 'erase', 'one', 'future', 'existence', 'rather', 'one', 'memories', 'story', 'shifts', 'gears', 'completely', 'second', 'hour', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'younger', 'protagonist', 'venturing', 'farm', 'encountering', 'young', 'mother', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'son', 'Willis', 'older', 'half', 'searches', 'child', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'Rainmaker', 'movie', 'later', 'section', 'when', 'Looper', 'momentum', 'audience', 'shift', 'gears', 'something', 'resembling', 'remake', 'Firestarter', 'something', 'off', 'unexpected', 'not', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'never', 'forward', 'narrative', 'thrust', 'first', 'half', 'also', 'hampered', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'unlikeable', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'distracting', 'make-up', 'also', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'necessary', 'actor', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'capable', 'enough', 'mimic', 'Willis', 'persona', 'less', 'prosthetic', 'involved', 'Willis', 'fine', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'believable', 'work', 'child', 'mother', 'none', 'are', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'sympathetic', 'Johnson', 'script', 'also', 'frustratingly', 'dangles', 'questions', 'front', 'viewers', 'making', 'strong', 'enough', 'connection', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'dramatically', 'impossible', 'go', 'aspects', 'spoiling', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comment', 'further', 'partially', 'involve', 'picture', 'ending', 'one', 'thing', 'be', 'ambiguous', 'when', 'dots', 'are', 'so', 'weakly', 'connected', 'suggestion', 'certain', 'concepts', 'come', 'thin', 'air', 'due', 'lack', 'development', 'Looper', 'then', 'cold', 'unusual', 'film', 'less', 'groundbreaking', 'genre', 'picture', 'interesting', 'B-movie', 'intriguing', 'elements', 'something', 'fundamentally', 'lacking', 'center', 'Looper', 'Blu-Ray', '20', 'deleted', 'scenes', '17', 'are', 'exclusive', 'format', 'featurettes', 'including', 'profile', 'scoring', 'Nathan', 'Johnson', 'commentary', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Blunt', 'BD', 'exclusive', 'Sci']",Looper

This is a great science fiction film that at first I was wary of because the marketing they do with films these days are sometimes not that great. I was dead wrong I thought this was incredible the acting the story the set pieces  the camera work it was all really really good. This is the best performance from Bruce Willis that i've seen since unbreakable and that was 12 years ago. Anyways the Blu Ray is really good the sound and the picture quality are great in a film that has some very bleak looking scenes because it takes place a future that is very bleak and not to over the top the city is futuristic  but still somewhat grounded in reality and outside the city it looks like our world today for the most part anyways. And the special feature are very interesting.

1483727,A1SVDMHSHYA7T9,B005LAII8K,"Angry Okie ""Jenna Haze Fan""","[0, 0]","This is the best Rian Johnson movie thus far in my opinion, as always Joseph Gordon Levitt was great and it always helps to have an all-star cast alomgside the main characters of him and Bruce Willis. As far as willis goes, i'd say this was his best sci-fi film to date since i couldn't even bare to watch the trailer for surrogates. Emily Blunt is a large role towards the 2nd half and she is solid as well, and always beautiful. Even if she hasn't in my opinion been cast in any stellar roles, i think she could shine in one nonetheless. I overall thought this movie was well worth the rent and would buy it later on, i was debating renting this or Taken 2 and am very glad i chose this since i know T2 would be good, but less original. The film industry needs more sci-fi that isn't cheesy and this movie does good to deliver just that.

When done wrong it can be disastrous, but when done RIGHT, a masterpiece is born.And Looper gets everything right.Looper is influenced by Time-Travel classics such as12 Monkeys, andThe Terminator, yet is extremely original.Blending stylish, visceral action, with sharp, thought-provoking storytelling, stunning scope and cinematography, memorable characters, stellar acting, pulse-pounding twists, moments of unexpected humour, and a truly moving finale, Looper asks big questions, engages our hearts and our heads, and pulls no punches.Rising star Joseph Gordon-Levitt leads the film, exuding an intense charisma, definitely holding his own against the older Willis. Bruce Willis, whose 57 years have not diminished his ability to kick ass, is more than awesome as the morally tortured old version of Levitt's character. Emily Blunt rounds out the main cast, with Paul Dano, Jeff Daniels, and Noah Segan absolutely stealing the scenes in their respective roles.The look of the film is impressive. Johnson and cinematographer Steve Yedlin have crafted the most gritty-realistic and believable future world since Children of Men. Johnson has found the perfect mix of believable physics, and entertaining sci-fi (hover bikes, blunderbusses, and telekinesis). And Nathan Johnson's (Rian's cousin) score suits the film beautifully.The story is totally original, equalling if not surpassing that of films such as Inception and Source Code. The plot is on the surface simple, but as one digs deeper, they find that Looper is a multi-layered, deep, thought-provoking film. Rian Johnson poses a lot of hard questions to the audience, and as the film progresses, it really makes you think. It's truly one of the best written films of the last 10 years.But don't  worry, there's  plenty of  action all the  way  through  to keep  you  absolutely riveted  to your seat. Utterly spectacular, brutal, electrifying, roaring, crashing, wicked, thrilling action!So, in recap:  Looper has a stellar cast, sensational cinematography, a thought-provoking script to die for, and pulse-pounding action. It's both the best sci-fi and the action film of the year. Ranking with Moon, Minority Report, Children of Men, and Inception, Looper is one of the greatest science fiction films of the 21st Century.A 5 star triumph!",5,Best Sci-Fi of the Year.

They are right.  A whole lot of stuff doesn't make sense, and we're supposed to just gobble that because it's time travel and, actually, the acting is good, and there are some really very cool scenes where time sort of morphs back and forth.  Pretty women, too.  Especially Bruce Willis's Chinese wife.  Very dignified.Since everyone has said everything, I'll point out the ending, which is ""noble.""  For sure.  But, and a second warning if you've not seen it....Here's my question.  In the end, the noble younger Bruce goes nobler and breaks the loop by, supposedly, prohibiting the evil telepathic kid from becoming bitter after his mother person's potentially bloody demise.  So the loop is broken.  The guys disappear.  End of evil.Now, given that.  Are we supposed to assume the following.  The kid, who was prevented from becoming bitter by not being on the train feeling horrified, as the younger Bruce imagines, doesn't grow up to become the monster of time and space because said loop is broken?  If so...My dear friends.  After the aborted blow up, all the silver is lying in the road, next to the younger Bruce's or older or whatever futuristic golf cart.  If the loop were truly broken, and that's the thrust of the noble part, then the silver would not be there.  Nor the cart.  Nor any memory among anyone about what happened.  Nor the kid's wound.And so...look at the last scene of the kid grimacing menacingly.  The real loop was never broken, if you follow my logic.  Nothing changed.  All the Bruces did was actually fill in the plot for the kid. They should have killed him.  They were set up.  So the plot isn't about the triumph of nobility.  It's about the futility of nobility, the pathos of any human desire to become a good person.  Nothing gets any better.  Evil rules and the good guys get messed and killed.You tell me if I'm wrong, but I tend to have very few plot holes in my noggin.  If someone mentiioned this before, I apologize.

1483742,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005LAII8K,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I may reveal a MAJOR spoiler in my first paragraph.  It would probably be best to only read my review if you've already seen Looper.Looper has amazing special effects borrowed from the Matrix obviously, but the storyline is REALLY confusing.  It's a science fiction flick about a man who works as a mob hit man protecting a farmland woman and her supernatural Village of the Damned-inspired child from a 30-year old version of *himself*.  Do you follow?  Because it's extremely confusing.  In other words, Bruce Willis returns 30 years later to communicate with -and prevent- the younger version of himself (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) from making the same horrible regrettable mistakes that cost his Asian wife her life as a result of a mob shooting.The first 30 minutes is *nothing* but confusion, but as soon as Bruce and Joseph meet up at a restaurant (after the realization that Joseph *shouldn't* try killing his older self at every immediate opportunity) this is when the storyline improves.  It's sort of funny to me however, when Joseph was simply standing in a cornfield pointing a gun at an empty blanket waiting for Bruce's character to appear so he can shoot him, lol.It's sort of annoying that the writers didn't make Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt one and the same.  In other words, they should have simply either disguised Bruce as a younger man during the segments that involve Joseph, or disguise Joseph as an older person during the parts that portray the older version of himself.  Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt look *nothing* alike.  Hard to follow I know, haha.Looper is also loaded (overloaded) with abrupt and VERY direct gun shootings of the violent variety.  Be prepared for these or you'll be knocked through your roof in complete shock.  They are always LOUD and very sudden, but the actual talking/conversations taking place between the characters throughout the film is really quiet.  Not a good combination.  Throw in an Asian woman who's presence never made sense to me (I *thought* I was beginning to make some sense of this storyline 30 minutes in but I was wrong- wasn't Joseph's character supposed to find *this* girl and protect her?  Why did he stick around the farmlands and form a relationship with the other woman instead?) and you have a very bizarre movie.I think it's also strange that the action in the beginning takes a dramatic turn later on and mellows out considerably once Joseph's character falls in love with a farmland girl.  This portion of the film takes up the entire second half.  Really strange.  Overall, one of the most confusing science fiction films you'll ever see.  You know now that I think about it, I normally have trouble following mob movies, and science fiction films can either be really easy or really hard to follow (no in between) so... now I know why Looper made a loop around my head, lol.",3,fun to watch; confusing to understand,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,2884,"['may', 'reveal', 'MAJOR', 'spoiler', 'first', 'paragraph', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'only', 'read', 'review', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'Looper.Looper', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'borrowed', 'Matrix', 'obviously', 'storyline', 'REALLY', 'confusing', 'science', 'fiction', 'flick', 'man', 'who', 'mob', 'hit', 'man', 'protecting', 'farmland', 'woman', 'supernatural', 'Village', 'Damned-inspired', 'child', '30-year', 'old', 'version', '*himself*', 'Do', 'follow', 'extremely', 'confusing', 'other', 'words', 'Bruce', 'Willis', '30', 'years', 'later', 'communicate', '-and', 'prevent-', 'younger', 'version', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'making', 'same', 'horrible', 'regrettable', 'mistakes', 'cost', 'Asian', 'wife', 'life', 'result', 'mob', 'shooting.The', 'first', '30', 'minutes', '*nothing*', 'confusion', 'as', 'soon', 'Bruce', 'Joseph', 'meet', 'up', 'restaurant', 'realization', 'Joseph', ""*shouldn't*"", 'try', 'killing', 'older', 'self', 'immediate', 'opportunity', 'when', 'storyline', 'sort', 'funny', 'however', 'when', 'Joseph', 'was', 'simply', 'standing', 'cornfield', 'pointing', 'gun', 'empty', 'blanket', 'waiting', 'Bruce', 'character', 'appear', 'can', 'shoot', 'lol.It', 'sort', 'annoying', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'one', 'same', 'other', 'words', 'should', 'have', 'simply', 'disguised', 'Bruce', 'younger', 'man', 'segments', 'involve', 'Joseph', 'disguise', 'Joseph', 'older', 'person', 'parts', 'portray', 'older', 'version', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'look', '*nothing*', 'alike', 'Hard', 'follow', 'know', 'haha.Looper', 'also', 'loaded', 'overloaded', 'abrupt', 'VERY', 'direct', 'gun', 'shootings', 'violent', 'variety', 'Be', 'prepared', ""'ll"", 'be', 'knocked', 'roof', 'complete', 'shock', 'are', 'always', 'LOUD', 'very', 'sudden', 'actual', 'talking/conversations', 'taking', 'place', 'characters', 'film', 'really', 'quiet', 'Not', 'good', 'combination', 'Throw', 'Asian', 'woman', 'who', 'presence', 'never', 'made', 'sense', '*thought*', 'was', 'beginning', 'make', 'sense', 'storyline', '30', 'minutes', 'was', 'wrong-', 'was', ""n't"", 'Joseph', 'character', 'supposed', 'find', '*this*', 'girl', 'protect', 'Why', 'did', 'stick', 'around', 'farmlands', 'form', 'relationship', 'other', 'woman', 'instead', 'have', 'very', 'bizarre', 'movie.I', 'think', 'also', 'strange', 'action', 'beginning', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'later', 'out', 'considerably', 'once', 'Joseph', 'character', 'love', 'farmland', 'girl', 'portion', 'film', 'up', 'entire', 'second', 'half', 'Really', 'strange', 'Overall', 'one', 'most', 'confusing', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'know', 'now', 'think', 'normally', 'have', 'trouble', 'following', 'mob', 'movies', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'can', 'either', 'be', 'really', 'easy', 'really', 'hard', 'follow', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'Looper', 'made', 'loop', 'head', 'lol']",Looper

After thirty years on the job a Looper is retired by being sent back 30 years in time to himself for the purpose of being dispatched. Older Joe (Bruce Willis) is fine with this until an inappropriate shot dispatches the love of his life. So now he must go back and correct the system by removing the person who made this shot possible.Will he succeed yes or no? In either case what will be the outcome? Will younger Joe cow-down to his wishes or learn something from this experience? We watch this presentation and wonder what we would do if we were either Joe. We too must make decisions in life and this movie may help us or not in making those decisions. In any case it's worth watching this movie at least a couple of times.The story is really about relationships and choices. It is not really a sci-fi story about time travel. The time thing is just one dimension to help show the outcome of the choices we make.The presentation even though having lots of action does not contain a lot of gratuitous gore. It also does not rely on a lot of CGI. There may be a tad too much background music but not enough to distract from the presentation.There is a big logic flaw.

Martin,"[3, 4]","Looper is one huge mess of a movie that seems to be under the impression that its unique concept can compensate for its numerous flaws and plotholes.  That's unfortunate because I was truly hoping that this film would be the next Memento; a groundbreaking and mindbending blend of entertainment and art.  Looper doesn't even come close.Rian Johnson's much buzzed about screenplay is set in the year 2044 where a group of hitmen known as Loopers carry out executions against targets sent to them from crime bosses from the future, thirty years in the future to be exact, when time travel has been invented but is illegal and utilized almost exclusively by crime organizations as a means to tie up loose ends.  One of the Loopers named Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is placed in an unusual predicament when one of his targets is his future self (Bruce Willis) who has been sent back to be killed in order to ""close the loop"".  Confused yet?  Essentially when a looper's services are no longer needed, his future self is sent back in time for execution since the mob wants to make sure that he never rats them out somewhere down the line.That concept requires the willing suspension of disbelief from viewers, but the real problem isn't with how absurd the whole thing is.  No, the problem is with the execution.  The movie never seems to flow coherently and feels flung together haphazardly.  Perhaps things would have turned out better if Johnson had let someone else have the director's chair.  His screenplay is brimming with ideas, but he doesn't do a very good job of bringing his vision to the screen.The performances are poor as well.  Gordon-Levitt's likability and charm are buried beneath the ridiculous prosthetics that he wears in order to resemble a young Bruce Willis.  He spends the entire film mumbling his lines in his best attempt to sound jaded and world-weary.  Willis, who is almost always a reliable action hero, doesn't have much to work with here and his character is one dimensional and bland.  Only Jeff Daniels as a mob boss sent from the future to manage the loopers approaches the material with the kind of ""let's not take things quite so seriously"" attitude that seems more fitting.It's too bad that Looper fails so mightily since its premise is ripe for a great movie.  This just isn't that movie.  It would have been better served by a different cast, a different director and a different tone.

The ending of the movie came with a twist that was both happy and sad, more so because I became so invested in the characters.

1483752,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B005LAII8K,Brian C.,"[1, 2]","I was not expecting great things from this film. From the trailer I gathered that it was going to be an attempt to put a new spin on the time travel theme. Usually, when a film has what I consider to be an overly ""clever"" premise (for lack of a better word) I wind up being disappointed. Movies with overly clever premises usually wind up being all about the premise, and they tend to leave out other things that I think are important: interesting characters, an interesting plot, and some thematic material with some substance. So that is what I was expecting with this film. I assumed I would be entertained, but I was not expecting much more than that. What I got was much more interesting, and much more satisfying, than what I was expecting.First of all, the makers of this movie were clearly aware that they were operating with a well worn premise. We have all seen so many time travel movies and shows that we have become jaded. The interesting paradoxes that arise when trying to think about time travel are no longer all that interesting. They no longer blow minds the way they used to. There is a scene in this movie where young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and old Joe (Bruce Willis) are sitting at a diner and young Joe starts to ask the standard, mind-bending, time travel questions (""so when I do things does it change your memory?"", etc.). Old Joe essentially brushes him off by saying ""If we start talking about that we are going to be talking about it all day"". I take this to be the filmmakers saying to the audience ""We know you have heard all of this before so we are not going to repeat it."" I always appreciate it when filmmakers are self-conscious enough to know when they are bordering on cliche. Ultimately it is probably impossible to avoid cliche entirely in a time travel movie, but I appreciated the nod to the audience, and this movie actually does succeed in avoiding cliche. It is hard to imagine a time travel movie that has something new to say, but this one does (though, not necessarily about time travel, which is not really what this movie is about).The goal of the movie did not seem to me to be to ""bend minds"". In fact, while the premise is an interesting premise, I felt like the premise was really just a means to explore some more interesting themes. Themes about the cycle of violence, and how to break it, and about personal transformation. It also raises some interesting questions about how we look back on our old selves. Old Joe does not think very highly of young Joe. While very few of us have probably ever had the experience of traveling back in time and talking to our old selves in person (I have, but I am an exception) I think we can all relate to old Joe's attitude towards his younger self. With perspective, and hopefully a little personal growth, our past errors, and stupidity, often become glaring. This movie dramatizes that universal human experience by having Joe's young and old selves actually come face to face.The premise, in other words, is not just clever for the sake of being clever, it serves a purpose, and it allows the filmmakers to explore a number of interesting ideas and themes, which is what I think good movies, and good premises, are supposed to do. There is a real human story at the center of this film. It is certainly an exciting, and entertaining movie, but the center of the movie is a human story about original sin and redemption. When I say 'original sin', I do not mean 'original sin' in the theological sense. I just mean that the violence of the world existed before we were born and we were all, to some degree, victims of that violence before we were old enough to make conscious decisions, and we all tend to perpetuate that violence, to some degree, into the future by visiting it upon future generations, before they are old enough to make conscious decisions, and so on. That, to me, is really what this movie is about.There is one last thing that I really appreciated about this film: it trusted its audience. That is so rare. To explain what I mean I am going to have to give some things away about the plot, so this is my SPOILER ALERT. The ""hero"" of the film is really kind of an anti-hero. Joe is already an assassin when the movie begins. Now, it seems like most films would do everything they could to downplay that, and try to sell the audience on the ""assassin with a heart of gold"". This movie goes in exactly the opposite direction. Early in the movie Joe sells out his best friend for money, and even old Joe, who is supposed to be reformed, makes it his mission to kill ""The Rainmaker"". Old Joe knows ""The Rainmaker"" is one of three kids, but he does not know which, and so he starts killing them one at a time (two of them, remember, are innocent). Most movies would have found a way around all of that. There would have been some plot twist that would have revealed who ""The Rainmaker"" was before old Joe actually killed anyone, or young Joe would have knocked the gun out of old Joe's hands just in time. Most filmmakers would not have trusted their audience to stick with a main character with such a dark side.Filmmakers (or maybe it is the studios) seem to think that audiences want morally unambiguous characters, or, that audiences are unwilling to put up with any moral ambiguity, complexity, or subtlety. Movies have to go all one way or the other with characters. Either they are good, in which case they can never do anything morally reprehensible, or even morally ambiguous, or they are evil, in which case they are pure evil and have no conscience at all. Fimmakers (or studios) seem to think that audiences are incapable of understanding anything more subtle than that. I do not think that is true, and it frustrates me. The world is morally complex and ambiguous, and morally complex and ambiguous characters tend to make the most interesting characters, so I wish that more movies had the guts to do what this movie did: have a hero who was clearly very flawed and unlikable in many ways. The main character in this film does not fall into either extreme. He is certainly not ""good"". He does things that are genuinely morally reprehensible. But he has a conscience, at least at times. It is just that his own self-interest tends to outweigh his conscience most of the time (does that sound at all familiar?) So I just want to say how much I appreciated the fact that the filmmakers trusted their audience enough to make their main character so morally ambiguous.This genuinely was a very entertaining, and interesting, movie, and I highly recommend it.

1483753,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B005LAII8K,Brian Driver,"[0, 0]","""Looper"" is a violent but rewarding action movie that delves into the mental conundrum of time travel, enjoys the mental crisis it creates, then backs off just far enough so that it's an enjoyable couple of hours. It's a heady flick that asks several questions of the viewer, especially: Would you kill your past or future self off if it meant protecting someone you love?""Looper"" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Bruce Willis, and Emily Blunt, and is directed by Rian Johnson, a relative newcomer whose claim to fame is 2005's neat little oddball film Brick [HD], which he also wrote and directed. Interestingly enough, it also starred Gordon-Levitt.This time around, Rian Johnson offers us a clever take on futuristic action films, and ""Looper"" by and large succeeds, offering Willis in a somewhat typical role of a rough-and-tumble killer, but this time he has a sentimental side. He's been brought back from the future to be murdered (called ""Closing the Loop"" for reasons I'll explain in the next paragraph), and he hopes his actions here, in HIS past, might save the woman he loves in his PREVIOUS present (NOW and forevermore his future).You see, Willis plays Joe, whose younger self (played by Gordon-Levitt) is a unique kind of assassin. Thirty years from the movie's ""present"" (it's set in 2044, so ITS future is 2074), digital IDs make murder next to impossible, so organized crime bosses who want people knocked off have to send them back in time with hands tied and hoods on their heads, where they are immediately shot dead and their bodies incinerated. However, something new is going on in the future, and a new crime boss (called ""the Rainmaker"") is bent on consolidating power by killing the KILLERS themselves through capturing them, sending them back, and having the killers kill THEMSELVES, thus ""Closing the Loop""--get it?But Willis, whom I'll call Future Joe for clarity's sake, is smart (of course), and he outwits Present Joe and escapes. What happens is too complex to fully explain here, but suffice it to say that not only does Present Joe have a lot of trouble killing Future Joe, but Future Joe's reasons for staying alive are beginning to make sense to Present Joe. Worse yet, the longer Future Joe is on the loose, the more trouble Present Joe has staying free and alive; as the killer who messed up his assassination, things are getting a bit sticky for him.Emily Blunt comes into play as a single mother who lives by the side of a huge corn field into which Present Joe has escaped, and she reluctantly takes him in to protect him. While she warns her son to steer clear of him, Present Joe has begun to take an interest in the boy's significance, and he realizes he may need to stick around to protect him from his future self.NOTE: leaving out an entire sub-plot which, if I were to include it, would tell you too much about the movie. Suffice it to say the movie is a bit more complex than I've presented it here, but a clear head should be able to follow it. It's no Inception, clarity-wise, but there are some definite brain-teasers, surprises and plot twists here, and director (and writer) Johnson deserves credit for making a clever movie that asks action-ers to think as they watch.An interesting side-note: some might be thrown off by Gordon-Levitt's ""alterations,"" facially...however it was done, G-L looks a lot LIKE a younger Willis, and there are some who might find that off-putting, the kind of thing that causes them to focus on the changes and let it interfere with their enjoyment of the movie. (I mention this because some reviewers HAVE mentioned it.)While Willis, G-L, and Blunt all handle their roles well, one character I enjoyed watching was Jeff Daniels as Abe, a ""present"" day crime boss who's actually been imported from the future so that he can better fathom and take charge of the events that transpire. Rather than portraying the typical power-hungry mobster boss, Daniels plays the role with a calm intelligence that adds an interesting element to his leadership.When another assassin screws up his own Closing of the Loop, slightly ahead of G-L's and Willis' dilemma, Abe resists those who are falling all over themselves in order to handling it. Instead, as the narrative switches to the man who should have been assassinated, we slowly witness him ""coming apart"": first he notices one finger is missing, then another, and on and on. It's then we realize that Abe has grabbed the present day assassin and, to force the future version to turn himself in, he has begun CHOPPING. Realizing what's at stake, the future criminal can't turn himself in fast enough...literally. Suffice it to say the sequence is pretty ugly...There are other clever tricks played with the time factor, and it makes for an entertaining--though occasionally violent--movie.If you like a good Bruce Willis movie you should enjoy this one: it's a smart movie full of action, drama, and possesses a compelling storyline. You need to keep sharp while watching, but you don't need to master the space-time continuum. Just sit back and enjoy yourself: ""Looper"" should provide you with a pleasant couple of hours.",4,A Time-ly Adventure Gets High Marks,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,5145,"['Looper', 'violent',

1483754,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B005LAII8K,Brian Maitland,"[0, 1]","Wow, what a weird rollercoaster ride this movie is. I almost gave up on it after 30 minutes I grew so bored. The start is not good given it starts off with the whole voiceover narration explaining what a ""looper"" is. That's usually the kiss of death when you have to explain the premise of the movie before it even really gets started but once Bruce Willis shows up the story does take off. Sadly, it's only in quite spectacular spurts.There are some huge flaws with this like why in this badass future are the guns so 18th century-like? They even call them blunderbusses. Is this some inside joke because I did not get that at all? Then we get the whole odd makeup they put J. Gordon Levitt in to make him look like a younger version of Willis. Sorry, but it did not work at all. I just found it a total distraction especially wondering if those Noel Gallagher Oasis eyebrows were going to lift off and make a movie of their own in many scenes.Throw in an excellent Emily Blunt (oddly playing a Kansas farm girl because apparently in the entire acting community in the U.S. there is not a single American actress who could have possibly played this Midwestern role) with the scariest kid since Damien in The Omen and this movie does have some get up and go. Where it went and ends up is pure sci-fi mumbo jumbo at times. Basically, cut through all the nonsense and it's Terminator--guy goes back in time to kill off the kid before he can become the powerful evil guy in the future.The extras help explain the connection Levitt has with the writer-director of this so now I understand why friends should not let friends act in their movies.

But I never enjoyed time travel as a plot device because of the old paradox problem:  I go back in a time machine to the time before my parents met and kill my father.  Therefore, I could not have existed in the future to go back in time to begin with.  Or better yet I go a back in time and kill Albert Einstein when he is a child.  As a result the entire history of the world instantly changes.  Balderdash.  On the other hand, going forward in time is at least a reasonable concept.  But I couldn't meet myself as an old man in that future time, because I had departed from my original time stream to travel into the future.  There couldn't be two of me existing at the same time.  My God, one is plenty.  ""Looper"" is just that sort of story and I keep saying, ""Wait a minute, that just doesn't add up!""There once was a fellow named Brite,Whose speed surpassed that of light.He departed one day,And in a relative wayReturned on the previous night.Having got that off my chest I can say ""Looper"" is a well made and acted film.

1483794,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B005LAII8K,DanD,"[30, 34]","Joseph Gordon-Levitt and writer/director Rian Johnson proved to be the perfect pair with 2005's BRICK.  They're back together again in LOOPER, the story of a hitman who kills people sent back in time from the future.  Joe's got a good life: drugs, babes, money.  Of course, this lifestyle comes with a catch: one day, the person you're supposed to kill turns out to be your future self.  This means you get to live out your remaining years (roughly 30) doing whatever you so desire.  Of course, in Joe's case, things don't go according to plan; his future self escapes, on a mission to prevent the death of his wife, and now both Joes find themselves being pursued by ruthless killers.LOOPER is stunning.  Visually, it's a treat; the effects are impressive, the cinematography astounding.  The action is slick and the dialogue is quick and intelligent, just what we'd expect from a Rian Johnson script.  Perhaps the biggest surprise here (well, for non-Johnson fans, at least) is the caliber of acting.  The supporting cast is impressive: Emily Blunt, Noah Segan, Garrett Dillahunt, and child actor Pierce Gagnon all shine, while Jeff Daniels and Paul Dano are especially memorable.  Bruce Willis brings gravitas to the role of future Joe; he doesn't say much, but as with his best performances, he's able to convey quite a lot with his piercing gaze.  Older Joe is a complex character, and Willis is able to play his single-minded obsession to commit atrocious deeds for sympathetic reasons.But this is Gordon-Levitt's film.  Sure, he has prosthetics to make him resemble Willis; but more to the point, much as Josh Brolin did a la Tommy Lee Jones for MEN IN BLACK 3, Gordon-Levitt has studied Willis's mannerisms and voice, coming off as a truly convincing younger version of the actor.  And yet, the role isn't mere imitation; Gordon-Levitt proves why he's considered one of the best rising actors out there right now, bringing a haunting sense of pathos (not to mention cojones) to his role.  Thanks to his performance, and Rian Johnson's script, LOOPER comes off as one of the most unique, memorable science fiction/action films in years.  It'll go down as a cult classic, and maybe one day, simply a classic example of the genre.",5,Science fiction done right.,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2235,"['Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'writer/director', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'proved', 'be', 'perfect', 'pair', '2005', 'BRICK', ""'re"", 'back', 'together', 'again', 'LOOPER', 'story', 'hitman', 'who', 'people', 'sent', 'back', 'time', 'future', 'Joe', 'got', 'good', 'life', 'drugs', 'babes', 'money', 'course', 'lifestyle', 'catch', 'one', 'day', 'person', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'kill', 'out', 'be', 'future', 'self', 'get', 'live', 'out', 'remaining', 'years', 'roughly', '30', 'doing', 'so', 'desire', 'course', 'Joe', 'case', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'according', 'plan', 'future', 'self', 'escapes', 'mission', 'prevent', 'death', 'wife', 'now', 'Joes', 'find', 'being', 'pursued', 'ruthless', 'killers.LOOPER', 'stunning', 'Visually', 'treat', 'effects', 'are', 'impressive', 'cinematography', 'astounding', 'action', 'slick', 'dialogue', 'quick', 'intelligent', 'just', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'script', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'here', 'well', 'non-Johnson', 'fans', 'least', 'caliber', 'acting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'impressive', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'Noah', 'Segan', 'Garrett', 'Dillahunt', 'child', 'actor', 'Pierce', 'Gagnon', 'shine', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'are', 'especially', 'memorable', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'gravitas', 'role', 'future', 'Joe', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'best', 'performances', 'able', 'convey', 'quite', 'lot', 'piercing', 'gaze', 'Older', 'Joe', 'complex', 'character', 'Willis', 'able', 'play', 'single-minded', 'obsession', 'commit', 'atrocious', 'deeds', 'sympathetic', 'reasons.But', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'film', 'Sure', 'prosthetics', 'make', 'resemble', 'Willis', 'more', 'point', 'much', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'did', 'la', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'MEN', 'IN', 'BLACK', '3', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'studied', 'Willis', 'mannerisms', 'voice', 'coming', 'off', 'truly', 'convincing', 'younger', 'version', 'actor', 'yet', 'role', ""n't"", 'mere', 'imitation', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'why', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'rising', 'actors', 'out', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'bringing', 'haunting', 'sense', 'pathos', 'not', 'mention', 'cojones', 'role', 'Thanks', 'performance', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'script', 'LOOPER', 'off', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'memorable', 'science', 'fiction/action', 'films', 'years', ""'ll"", 'go', 'down', 'as', 'cult', 'classic', 'maybe', 'one', 'day', 'simply', 'classic', 'example', 'genre']",Looper

The first half of the movie sets this climax up very well, while the second introduces us to Cid, played by newcomer Pierece Gagnon, as well as his mother Sara played by the always great Emily Blunt. I have to give a lot of credit to Gagnon, who gives a very memorable performance and piqued my interest in any future roles he lands.Now, be warned that since there is time travel involved, the movie does contain potential plot holes if you dwell on events and their consequences too much.

The gang's inflexible rule is that hitmen in the past must kill whoever is sent back in time to them, including their older selves ... or suffer ""grave"" consequences.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the younger self of the film's main hitman, and Bruce Willis plays that same hitman's 30-year-older self, who at some point will be sent back for Younger-Self-Gordon-Levitt to kill.As virtually every viewer will expect from the beginning of this film, when Older-Self-Willis arrives in the past, he escapes from his younger self.SPOILER #1: However, Older-Self-Willis is not just selfishly trying to prolong his own life (while putting his younger self in jeopardy); he has a special mission in the past that involves killing the younger self of the warped-genius-villain who caused the death of a woman he loves in his future world. In other words, Older-Self-Willis hopes to change the future by changing the past.PLOT HOLE #1 involves the killing IN THE FUTURE of the beloved woman. Why are ANY exceptions allowed to the Rule that ALL ""hits"" must take place in the past? The obvious answer is: This inconsistency is needed to motivate the entire main plot about Older-Self-Willis's mission ... even if that entire plot rests on quicksand.PLOT HOLES #2 and #3 and #4 ... and SPOILER #2: As with thousands of other Time Travel stories/movies, this one involves a recurring LOOP. And it is clear from a couple indications that this loop has already occurred at least twice before--but this is played down, and we are given no indication whether all the past loops (which may number in the billions) have been identical (clearly the most recent ones have been), and why THIS loop might be any different from them. Further, since the warped-genius-villain has encountered an Older-Self-Willis before, why does he take any chances by sending him back to the past again (and again and again)? And, since the warped-genius-villain IRONICALLY was warped as a child BY an Older-Self-Willis's attack, HOW could-or-did he ever become warped BEFORE any Older-Self-Willis went back in time and warped him? (This seems to be a FATAL FLAW in the plot, which no viewer is ever supposed to consider, especially in terms of the ending to THIS particular loop.)SPOILER #3: In an earlier scene, a different hitman recognized his older self when he arrived (bound and hooded) because his older self was singing his favorite song. He released his older self and then tried to hide.PLOT HOLES #5 and #6: The only reason the people being sent back are NOT drugged or gagged is that we (the audience) need to be shown WHAT happens to a hitman who disobeys the gang's rule. Logic would have dictated that the gang of the future should have killed people bloodlessly, with drugs or poisons, and merely shipped the corpses to the past for disposal. Logic would further dictate that an aged hitman in the future should be sent back to a different hitman in the past, not to his younger self (and that all younger selves should be kept uninformed about the killings of their future selves).PLOT HOLES #7 through #57: On numerous occasions, Older-Self-Willis exhibits implausible SUPER POWERS when he is confronting multiple armed opponents. For example, while unarmed, he is able to defeat his armed younger self, having already defeated at least FOUR ARMED MEN in the future; and when he is armed, he can easily defeat dozens of armed men and cause dozens of other armed men to quiver in abject terror that he will come for them.BUT ... WHAT SAVES THIS FILM (for me) despite all these PLOT HOLES is the ending. My favorite kind of story, whether it is found in mainstream literature, in mystery fiction, in science fiction ... whatever ... involves the sudden disclosure of a streak of unsuspected (but plausible) NOBILITY AND MORALITY in a person who had previously seemed ""only ordinary"" or even ""subhuman.""THAT is what occurs at the very end of this film ... and I will not ""spoil"" anyone's enjoyment of it by giving more details about it.If I were awarding this film a letter grade, given its roller-coaster ride of negative factors that terminate in a strongly positive and EMOTIONALLY SATISFYING conclusion, in my judgment it deserves a solid ""B"" ... perhaps almost a weak ""B+"".",4,"MARRED BY MANY PLOT HOLES, BUT HAS MY FAVORITE KIND OF ENDING!",1372464000,"06 29,

But back to Looper - I am always curious how the writers and directors will handle this sort of a film but I was very satisfied with the issues of time travel.

Also, included is a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:There are many films about time travel, sentimental to action-driven films.  And part of the challenge of a writer is to create a sci-fi action film without being too banal.Fortunately, writer/director Rian Johnson has crafted an intriguing sci-fi action film in which time travel is banned in the future and also a future that has been taken over by criminal organizations and 10% of the society which has gained special telekinetic (TK)) powers.It sounds so far out of left field and I admit being a bit skeptical when I first saw the trailer for this film, but having watched the film now, I realize that Johnson has crafted and original and unique storyline that I never expected to see, and the fact that it was so different, exciting and provided an action-packed storyline but wasn't filled with too much action or special effects and integrated a fascinating storyline made ""Looper"" a film that was much better than what I was expecting.In this day and age of special effects and popcorn action films, the whole entire concept of criminal organizations using time machines for illegal purposes, especially transporting people targeted for assassinations through a time machine from 2074 to 2044 for execution by Loopers was interesting.But it's the actual meeting of present and future Joe that is surprising.  Most films tend to show a present and future version of themselves, working together for the greater good.  Considering that present Joe (portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a criminal and that future Joe (portrayed by Bruce Willis) is a former criminal thanks to his loving wife who changed him, it's a different take because it becomes criminal vs. criminal but who in the end will be on top?While future Joe has changed to become a better man, it's the fact that he has come back to the past to kill the ""Rain Maker"" that makes the story quite interesting because the ""Rain Maker"" in 2044 is a young child.  And because he doesn't know which child will be the Rain Maker, he goes after three addresses to kill all children.  This reminds you of ""The Terminator"" when The Terminator goes to all addresses killing anyone named Sarah Conner but it's hard to sympathize with future Joe because he's going to kill innocent children for his ""greater good"" (no rain maker, no tyranny.  No rain maker, his wife survives).While present Joe just wants to kill his future self but when he finds out the boy he is protecting or has become friends with is the ""Rain Maker"", especially in Damian-esque fashion of a child that exceeds the 10% TK threshold and can have a human being explode, suffice to say, these are situations that I never expected to see for this film.And it's those unexpected twists that made ""Looper"" so entertaining!Joseph Gordon-Levitt has become an actor in recent years that gets better and better and as for Bruce Willis, he's one of the best action stars of all time!  Jeff Daniels moment in the film is quite short, but Emily Blunt was wonderful as the single mother and interesting to see Piper Perabo in her first nude prostitute scene.  But ""Looper"" features a solid cast who did a great job in the film!And as for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and lossless audio are fantastic!  There are a good number of special features included but if anything stayed in my head during my viewing of this film, it's the immersive soundtrack with gunshots galore and the wonderful makeup design and prosthetic use of trying to make Levitt look closer to Bruce Willis.Overall, Rian Johnson's ""Looper"" is an exciting sci-fi action film with a clever storyline with many twists and turns.  And on Blu-ray, the film looks and sounds incredible.

If you are one of these past time hit-men you are a Looper and your contract ends when you ""close"" your loop (Kill your future self).

The kill John Connor back time travel crap is real BS in that is it any surprise that we have these country wide mass shootings?  At one point when the little kid is splattering a guy in the living room, some guy in the theater behind me exclaims, ""cool"".  Really? Not horrific or really sad that a kid is doing this?  The old Bruce Willis as is stated, is willing to kill for his wife - yes, he is willing to kill ANYTHING and anyone for his wife.  For his own selfish purposes - not for anything else - not even really for his wife, for himself.  In one scene it is even pointed out that there is a simple way to protect and save his wife but of course no, he wouldn't have any of that - because it was all about what he wanted for himself and HIS loss of her.  Going back to the child killing scenes.  So he knows that ONE of these 3 children is going to do something bad, which means that he is more than willing to kill 2 innocent children to get at this ""bad"" one.  When he killed the first kid at least I can tell you that the theater was DEAD quiet.  A lot of these reviews I see happened before the Newtown shootings - so of course the scene was seen in a different light - or I would hope it would have been.I went to the movie because it did look interesting, yet I was not prepared for the total lack of empathy or regard for life at all. It was also interesting to see an NRA scenario played out though, one where almost everyone is armed. A guy steals something and another takes out his shotgun and guns him down in the street.  To some that is all well and good.  Of course discharging a firearm in a crowded street and the possibility of him missing and hitting your innocent wife, sister, brother, etc - is that also well and good?  Clearly society has already run down but guns are not necessarily the way to get culture problems back right again.  Even in the wild west, one of the first things to go when it came back to restoring law and order was to remove all of those guns that people freely carried.  Well, that is a thought for another venue, but movies do bring up ideas and philosophical points of view to ponder, at last they do for me.  Don't assume incorrectly that I'm a left leaning liberal because I'm not.  I own guns but this gun and culture problem we have is more complicated than each of its parts - which is the way we tend to deal with issues - in their parts and not as a whole.I'm not saying that it was impossible to understand the character's position or to care for the different characters that were presented.

He went through his own film noir craze growing up in southern Cal, and his first big feature ('Brick') was informed by film noir sensibilities: guys and girls in trouble, a central crime figure, and a fist full of violence. 'Looper' is no different, despite all the hoopla about time travel, and a few futuristic landscapes and clever, self-levitating motorcycles. When you get right down to it, Looper wears its noir on its sleeve: the entire drama is sparked by love for a woman (exotic, of course), there is a nasty,  central criminal mastermind (whose identity is kept a mystery for most of the film), and a fair number of bullets flying as things get sorted out. Rian Johnson also likes working with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who was a central figure in 'Brick' as well.  The casting of Bruce Willis as JGL's alternate self (more about this shortly) can only invite comparison to 'Twelve Monkeys', but Terry Gilliam's fantasy world looks completely different, and should not color your expectations of 'Looper', which is grounded in more earthly concerns.Yes, the major wrinkle in 'Looper' is time travel. The 'now' for this film is the year 2044 - where, we are told repeatedly, time travel has not been invented yet. Joseph Gordon-Levitt lives in 2044 and he's a trained assassin.  Time travel is invented sometime over the following 30 years. Bruce Willis is JGL thirty years later and returns to 2044 for the unfinished film noir business regarding the exotic female. He's mad and out for vengeance on account of the criminal mastermind from 2074, who did something nasty. Bruce Willis 'loops' into 2044, and the two 'versions' of our hero meet, share breakfast at the diner, and figure out what they're going do about the Bad Guy, so they can stop him from perpetrating the nastiness in 2074. When watching this drama unfold, it's tempting to make too much of this time 'looping'. It's really just as simple as I have laid out here. That is what this movie is about. It's not about the time machine (a device which is never seen), it's not about life in 2074 per se (which is illustrated only in a segment which sets up the Bad Guy problem, and does not look all that disarming). I'm not sure what I would do when sitting down to bacon and eggs with 'me' from 30 years in the future, but hey, this is what Bruce and Joe are confronted with. The film's ending - which I will not divulge - is just about the only way out of the dilemma posed by the narrative. To be fair to that central villain, you can see why he might have borne a grudge.A major felicity with this production is the interaction of JGL with Bruce Willis. JGL managed to get some of BW's mannerisms and personality down, so despite the difference in looks, the viewer has no issues with the idea that they are two individuals inhabiting the same character, face-to-face. Some of the visuals and props do seem a bit derivative: the 2074 henchmen remind me a bit too much of the 'tuners' from Alex Proyas' 'Dark City' (that noir influence again), but by and large the film benefits from very limited use of futuristic setups (again, I maintain this is not really intended to be a sci-fi film). Emily Blunt lends terrific support as a young single mother in 2044.The sound and visuals are of high caliber. There is a worthwhile feature commentary (Johnson, JGL, and Blunt - no Willis) and making-of feature. Johnson and JGL have formed a certain artistic bond, and it's rewarding to see this illustrated in these extras.",4,This is  Human Drama - The Sci-Fi is Just A Framework,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,3529,"['Director', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'film', 'noir', 'went', 'own', 'film', 'noir', 'craze', 'growing', 'up', 'southern', 'Cal', 'first', 'big', 'feature', ""'Brick"", 'was', 'informed', 'film', 'noir', 'sensibilities', 'guys', 'girls', 'trouble', 'central', 'crime', 'figure', 'fist', 'full', 'violence', ""'Looper"", 'different', 'hoopla', 'time', 'travel', 'few', 'futuristic', 'landscapes', 'clever', 'self-levitating', 'motorcycles', 'When', 'get', 'right', 'down', 'Looper', 'noir', 'sleeve', 'entire', 'drama', 'sparked', 'love', 'woman', 'exotic', 'course', 'nasty', 'central', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'identity', 'kept', 'mystery', 'most', 'film', 'fair', 'number', 'bullets', 'flying', 'things', 'get', 'sorted', 'out', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'also', 'working', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'was', 'central', 'figure', ""'Brick"", 'as', 'well', 'casting', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'JGL', 'alternate', 'self', 'more', 'shortly', 'can', 'only', 'invite', 'comparison', ""'Twelve"", 'Monkeys', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'fantasy', 'world', 'completely', 'different', 'should', 'not', 'color', 'expectations', ""'Looper"", 'grounded', 'more', 'earthly', 'concerns.Yes', 'major', 'wrinkle', ""'Looper"", 'time', 'travel', ""'now"", 'film', 'year', '2044', 'where', 'are', 'told', 'repeatedly', 'time', 'travel', 'not', 'been', 'invented', 'yet', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', '2044', 'trained', 'assassin', 'Time', 'travel', 'invented', 'sometime', 'following', '30', 'years', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'JGL', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'returns', '2044', 'unfinished', 'film', 'noir', 'business', 'regarding', 'exotic', 'female', 'mad', 'vengeance', 'account', 'criminal', 'mastermind', '2074', 'who', 'did', 'something', 'nasty', 'Bruce', 'Willis', '2044', 'two', ""'versions"", 'hero', 'meet', 'share', 'breakfast', 'diner', 'figure', 'out', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'can', 'stop', 'perpetrating', 'nastiness', '2074', 'When', 'watching', 'drama', 'unfold', 'tempting', 'make', 'too', 'much', 'time', ""'looping"", 'really', 'just', 'as', 'simple', 'have', 'laid', 'out', 'here', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'not', 'time', 'machine', 'device', 'never', 'seen', 'not', 'life', '2074', 'se', 'illustrated', 'only', 'segment', 'up', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'problem', 'not', 'look', 'disarming', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'when', 'sitting', 'down', 'bacon', 'eggs', ""'me"", '30', 'years', 'future', 'hey', 'what', 'Bruce', 'Joe', 'are', 'confronted', 'film', 'ending', 'will', 'not', 'divulge', 'just', 'only', 'way', 'dilemma', 'posed', 'narrative', 'be', 'fair', 'central', 'villain', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'might', 'have', 'borne', 'grudge.A', 'major', 'felicity', 'production', 'interaction', 'JGL', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'JGL', 'managed', 'get', 'BW', 'mannerisms', 'personality', 'down', 'difference', 'looks', 'viewer', 'issues', 'idea', 'are', 'two', 'individuals', 'inhabiting', 'same', 'character', 'face-to-face', 'visuals', 'props', 'do', 'seem', 'bit', 'derivative', '2074', 'henchmen', 'remind', 'bit', 'too', 'much', ""'tuners"", 'Alex', 'Proyas', ""'Dark"", 'City', 'noir', 'influence', 'again', 'large', 'film', 'benefits', 'very', 'limited', 'use', 'futuristic', 'setups', 'again', 'maintain', 'not', 'really', 'intended', 'be', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'terrific', 'support', 'young', 'single', 'mother', '2044.The', 'sound', 'visuals', 'are', 'high', 'caliber', 'worthwhile', 'feature', 'commentary', 'Johnson', 'JGL', 'Blunt', 'Willis', 'making-of', 'feature', 'Johnson', 'JGL', 'have', 'formed', 'certain', 'artistic', 'bond', 'rewarding', 'see', 'illustrated', 'extras']",Looper

Although some holes can't be avoided, (that goes with the territory) Looper is able to lean on its high-concept premise for support during such moments and effectively gloss them over. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, no strangers to sci-fi action sagas, seem perfectly at-home in this oddly familiar future setting, and though they're hounded by a violent gang of darkly-clad killers, the film's darkest role alternates repeatedly between its two leading players. There's a  lot to celebrate in the details here, from the oil crusted, not-so-distant future (which, admirably, looks an awful lot like the present) to the strict rules and regulations of the core concept, and for a short while the film seems content to toy with the spoils of its own ingenuity. Of course, there's also a time for leaving such trivialities behind, and Looper doesn't back away from it. When push comes to shove, it smartly explores the depth and dimensionality of its cast before ultimately pursuing an unexpected, yet appropriate, final destination.

When one does come along, it should be cherished and talked about among genre fans so the joy of viewing it is spread throughout the community. ""Looper"" is one of those prized treasures that deserve to be talked about and doted on.Time travel is invented and declared illegal in the near future. The mob uses it in a very inventive way. Disposing of a body after eliminating a target has become very difficult thanks to science and forensic advances. They use it to transport a target into the past where a hired assassin called a ""looper"" kills them and then burns the bodies. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of these highly-paid gunmen who are living the high life. That is until he's contracted to kill his future self (Bruce Willis) and things get complicated.Writer / director Rian Johnson (""Breaking Bad,"" ""The Brothers Bloom"") has created an intelligent and complex story that keeps viewers glued to the screen. It's been a long time since I've seen a film that so wonderfully blends together science fiction, action, and such a high level of emotional depth.I couldn't stop thinking about the premise of the movie throughout its two hour running time. There's never been a better visual illustration of the tragic aphorism, ""Eat, drink, and be merry; for tomorrow we die."" ""Looper"" also drums up some paranoia and makes you re-examine the statements ""Every action has a reaction"" and ""Everything we do matters.""The audio and video quality for ""Looper"" is beautiful and sounds great in a home theater setting. The picture is striking thanks to a great high-definition transfer. Colors all blend well together and are vibrant in their own distinct ways. The 5.1 surround brings to life every startling gunshot and sound effect used from the time-traveling pod noise to the rustling of crops on a farm.There's a good amount of special features included in the Blu-ray version of ""Looper."" Director / writer Rian Johnson and actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Emily Blunt provide audio commentary. Over 20 deleted scenes are found with optional commentary by Johnson and actor Noah Segan. It also contains three featurettes entitled ""The Future from the Beginning,"" ""The Science of Time Travel,"" and ""Scoring 'Looper.'"" An animated trailer for the movie is included as well.""Looper"" is everything a science fiction movie should be.

I saw a mom who would die for her son, a man who would kill for his wife, a boy, angry and alone, laid out in front of him the bad path. I saw it and the path was a circle, round and round...""I wanted to see ""Looper"" (2012) written/directed by Rian Johnson as soon as I read the first reviews about it. It intrigued me for several reasons. The critics and viewers praised it. The first two Johnson's films were interesting and original and I wanted to see his new work. I am a fan of the time travel genre. Where else does the hero sit at a table in a roadside diner facing himself, either thirty years older, or thirty years younger - depending on which side he is sitting? Or where else rather clich&eacute;d phrase ""he was in a deadly conflict with himself"" means just that? And more. What does a man feel at gun point, with himself holding the gun, either thirty years older, or thirty years younger?Another reason for me was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the main character Joe, the looper. He is a convincing versatile young actor, one of the most interesting of his generation. For Rian Johnson, Gordon-Levitt is kind of mascot. Johnson made all three movies with him, and Joseph was a leading man in two. An interesting feature of Gordon-Levitt's role (Joe ""closes the loops of time"" working as an assassin for the Mafia) is how he based Joe on young Bruce Willis. He plays young Willis' on- screen tough guy persona that we so get used to identify with and root for, and he does it very good. Bruce Willis also plays an important role of aged Joe. If you guessed that Willis would be saving the world that got into a serious trouble you may be right. This is what Willis does in the movie well: saves lost children, city, country, planet, and the universe. In ""Looper"" Willis plays retired hit man, whom his crime bosses sent with a bag on his head from the future, 2074 to the past 2044, to get rid of him with no trace. What happens to him when he arrives to the past, who meets him, how will he try to change the past to save the future - it's all in the loop, tied by Rian Johnson.By Johnson's words, despite the fact that ""Looper"" was a time travel film, he was more interested in creating the human characters, in choices they make in a situation that was caused by travel from future to past. This film is about making difficult choice, the possibility of one person to change the course of history, and how far he'd go for it. Dedicated to the paradox of time, ""Looper"" mixes futuristic science fiction and dark noir known for biting dialogue and off-screen sharp voice in Humphrey Bogart's movies style. Johnson adds the stories of love, not the least the love between a child and his mother. As befits a film about the possibility of time travel, the focus centers on whether it is possible, knowing exactly how the future will turn, to change something fundamentally important in the past, to correct it, and how this change will affect the lives of everyone involved. It would seem that nothing new, original and exciting can come out of the time travel genre after Terminator 1 and 2, 12 Monkeys, The Butterfly Effect, and their granddaddy, Le Jetee that started them all? But Johnson did it and even without a big budget, not trying to make a future in his film looking like a futuristic super modern giant metropolis. On the contrary, not so far removed future of 2044 looks more like the abandoned and gloomy suburbs of big city, shaken to its foundations by deep economic crisis, where the power is already in the hands of large criminal groups that control the time travel and use it to effectively get rid of the enemies sent from the future.Using the elements of the time travel genre, Looper goes beyond the borders. It asked interesting questions, and gave different answers. Rian Johnson, writer/ director, does not mind to break the rules of genres in his films. His films are more of stylizations, pastiches of genres he likes and interested in. The elements of genres are the building blocks, the bricks for him which he makes his films from. No wonder, his first film was called ""Brick"" (2005).To create a smart, interesting, original stylization, a game of mind - is not an easy task, and Johnson has the gift for it. His first two films, ""Brick"" and ""The Brothers Bloom"", were both intelligent, curious, but, rather, cerebral variations of films and books that Johnson likes. ""Looper"", his third, is also clever and gripping but what makes it the best of three, it's got heart in the right place. ""Looper"" affected me on a deep emotional level. ""Looper"", in my opinion is one of the best independent American movies of 2012. Being an independent filmmaker, Johnson is able to assert his creative ideas, but without super-budget. But I am glad that ""Looper"" did not look flashy and glamorous. It is more than just an eye-candy. It has a plot, intrigue, and the loop that it will close in a truly original, searing manner. While closing this loop, the film will answer the most important question - can you destroy the source of evil, which will bring tragedy and death to the future, if you look at it right now, this minute and ""you see it. You see a mom who would die for her son, a man who would kill for his wife, a boy, angry & alone, laid out in front of him the bad path. You see it and the path is a circle, round and round...""

1483874,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B005LAII8K,G. Denick,"[7, 10]","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.In some ways, ""Looper"" is a good movie. It attempts a unique premise on sci-fi, with very little emphasis on CGI and special effects (they are there in limited capacity, and performed convincingly). The acting is generally quite good, particularly what is offered by the protagonist. The plot was intriguing at first, but eventually fell apart by having major holes that destroyed the suspension of disbelief, in addition to undoing the earlier established ""rules"" of this particular fiction. The opening twenty minutes or so of the movie are riveting... but then things start to go south.Although the efforts at creating a bleak 2044 Kansas are partially successfull, it's pretty jarring when everybody's driving around in current gen Ford F-150s and Chevy Silverados. And why are the ""gat men"" waltzing around with antiquated six shooters, when there are fully automatic assault rifles RIGHT NEXT to them, just waiting for their enemy to pick up (which he does, of course, before going on a cartoon-like killing spree that defies the otherwise somber tone of the movie). The murder of Old Joe's wife in the future completely unravels the earlier established premise that the mob is unable to kill in their own time, thereby ruining the entire concept of the film, and making every action of every character nonsensical and without consequence.Furthermore, the rules of time travel are changed from scene to scene, for whatever needs the writer/director needs, until it becomes a bird's nest of paradoxes that don't hold up under even mild scrutiny. The director makes a weak attempt to gloss things over by having a couple of characters suggest, ""try not to think about the complications of time travel"", and Willis even pounds a table in anger at one point, repeating ""It [the rules/logic of our time travel] don't matter!"", as if shouting like an enraged toddler will nullify the gaping holes that have been poked in the film's logic. I'm completely capable of suspending my disbelief, and I rarely complain about things in fiction being ""unrealistic"", but these trespasses were too glaring to ignore, and they tarnish the experience.What upsets me most about this movie, however, is that the movie has a character (played by Willis, no less), who goes about murdering defenseless children (granted, he only got one, but he planned on three) for reasons that are completely selfish and irredeemable. Really? You're going to murder three little kids, just so you can have a few more years with your wife? Old Joe goes on to explain that he loves his wife because she is so compassionate and nurturing... and yet he's completely comfortable with committing his own dark deeds for the sake of spending more time with her, thereby undoing any and all good she may have achieved in her life.Yes, I understand that he is a ""villain"" of sorts in the movie (though the director clearly wants us to empathize with him, given all the time spent on flashbacks of his time with his wife), and I understand that the character is separate from the human being who is portraying him on screen, but there are certain things that are taboo, even in our society... and the murder of children is one such thing (particularly in this post-Newtown, post-Aurora world). That is not entertainment, it's cheap shock tactics. What's really disappointing is that this scene could have been EASILY avoided altogether... the character could have been abducted by the gat men on his first attempt, rather than his second, or he could have spent all his time trying to track down the true ""Rain Maker"", had that memory been bestowed upon him just a few hours earlier.I like Bruce Willis and enjoy his work, but ""Looper"" is a black eye on his career.",2,"Filled with plot holes, broken logic, and cheap shock tactics, ""Looper"" falls short",1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,3762,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS.In', 'ways', 'Looper', 'good', 'movie', 'unique', 'premise', 'sci-fi', 'very', 'little', 'emphasis', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'there', 'limited', 'capacity', 'performed', 'convincingly', 'acting', 'generally', 'quite', 'good', 'particularly', 'what', 'offered', 'protagonist', 'plot', 'was', 'intriguing', 'first', 'eventually', 'fell', 'apart', 'having', 'major', 'holes', 'destroyed', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'addition', 'undoing', 'earlier', 'established', 'rules', 'particular', 'fiction', 'opening', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'are', 'riveting', 'then', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'efforts', 'creating', 'bleak', '2044', 'Kansas', 'are', 'partially', 'successfull', 'pretty', 'jarring', 'when', 'everybody', 'driving', 'around', 'current', 'gen', 'Ford', 'F-150s', 'Chevy', 'Silverados', 'why', 'are', 'gat', 'men', 'waltzing', 'antiquated', 'six', 'shooters', 'when', 'are', 'fully', 'automatic', 'assault', 'rifles', 'RIGHT', 'NEXT', 'just', 'waiting', 'enemy', 'pick', 'up', 'course', 'going', 'cartoon-like', 'killing', 'spree', 'otherwise', 'somber', 'tone', 'movie', 'murder', 'Old', 'Joe', 'wife', 'future', 'completely', 'earlier', 'established', 'premise', 'mob', 'unable', 'kill', 'own', 'time', 'thereby', 'ruining', 'entire', 'concept', 'film', 'making', 'action', 'character', 'nonsensical', 'consequence.Furthermore', 'rules', 'time', 'travel', 'are', 'changed', 'scene', 'scene', 'writer/director', 'bird', 'nest', 'paradoxes', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'even', 'mild', 'scrutiny', 'director', 'weak', 'attempt', 'gloss', 'things', 'having', 'couple', 'characters', 'suggest', 'try', 'not', 'think', 'complications', 'time', 'travel', 'Willis', 'even', 'table', 'anger', 'one', 'point', 'repeating', 'rules/logic', 'time', 'travel', ']', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'shouting', 'enraged', 'toddler', 'will', 'nullify', 'gaping', 'holes', 'have', 'been', 'poked', 'film', 'logic', ""'m"", 'completely', 'capable', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'rarely', 'complain', 'things', 'fiction', 'being', 'unrealistic', 'trespasses', 'were', 'too', 'glaring', 'ignore', 'tarnish', 'experience.What', 'most', 'movie', 'however', 'movie', 'character', 'played', 'Willis', 'less', 'who', 'murdering', 'defenseless', 'children', 'granted', 'only', 'got', 'one', 'planned', 'three', 'reasons', 'are', 'completely', 'selfish', 'irredeemable', 'Really', ""'re"", 'going', 'murder', 'three', 'little', 'kids', 'just', 'can', 'have', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'wife', 'Old', 'Joe', 'explain', 'wife', 'so', 'compassionate', 'nurturing', 'yet', 'completely', 'comfortable', 'committing', 'own', 'dark', 'deeds', 'sake', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'thereby', 'undoing', 'good', 'may', 'have', 'achieved', 'life.Yes', 'understand', 'villain', 'sorts', 'movie', 'director', 'clearly', 'empathize', 'given', 'time', 'spent', 'flashbacks', 'time', 'wife', 'understand', 'character', 'separate', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'portraying', 'screen', 'are', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'taboo', 'even', 'society', 'murder', 'children', 'one', 'such', 'thing', 'particularly', 'post-Newtown', 'post-Aurora', 'world', 'not', 'entertainment', 'cheap', 'shock', 'tactics', 'What', 'really', 'disappointing', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'EASILY', 'avoided', 'altogether', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'abducted', 'gat', 'men', 'first', 'attempt', 'rather', 'second', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'time', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'true', 'Rain', 'Maker', 'had', 'memory', 'been', 'bestowed', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'earlier.I', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'enjoy', 'work', 'Looper', 'black', 'eye', 'career']",Looper

That's a lot of adjustments of which to keep track! That said the storyline and screenplay needed major work and the film was released too soon. First the storyline...why would the mafia of the future send their victims back into the past to be assassinated; when our oceans, lakes and deserts are full of unidentified bodies as it is? Of course the loop wouldn't work if this wasn't so...so this is a major failing right away. The screenplay deals with three major sub-plots which never quite link up throughout the film, leaving the viewer confused and asking what the hell is going on! The quick cross-editing was designed to make the audience question the actual plot, I think; yet it just basically confuses the viewer. The storyline does not flow smoothly, rather jumps around from sub-plot to sub-plot. The ending is of course the best part of the film; dealing with time-paradox, child psychology and self-sacrifice all rolled into one, giving us some miniscule satisfaction.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, who happens to be an alien from another planet, other than Earth. Along with his crazy dad, weirdo brother and overly masculine older sister (who are really all fellow aliens on a mission to Earth), he lives in a house. Since aliens have to earn money because some parts of the Earth work on a capitalist system, young Joe has to get a job, which is what the titular Looper refers to. A looper is basically a glorified UPS driver who also moonlights as an a/s/s/a/s/sin of older people on the side.One day, young Joe meets Hudson Hawk (AKA, Bruce Willis), whom he recognizes as his older self; except, Joe's older self is now out work and can't collect Social Security because it went insolvent back in the year 2020 thanks to the Democrats always failing to address the insolvency issue. Upset at Hudson Hawk (AKA, Bruce Willis), Joe decides to k/i/l/l him, only to find out that the real enemy happens to be an extremely muddled and confusing plot in this movie!Now, I won't dare spoil the ending at all because I respect fellow moviegoers. However, I will say the climatic ending involves Joe, Hudson Hawk, several references to Obama deputy camping manager Stephanie Cutter, many unfounded accusations against Mitt Romney, and, ultimately, something about a ""third rock from the sun""...whatever the heck that is!All in all, I loved Looper, and I plan on buying it on VHS when it finally comes out on home video, several months from now!",5,Awesomest Bruce Willis movie since Hudson Hawk!!,1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,1938,"['Looper', 'extremely', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', 'movie', 'fame', 'even', 'better', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'whom', 'know', 'love', 'appearance', 'Late', 'Night', 'Carson', 'Daily', 'late', '90s', 'where', 'played', 'few', 'chords', 'guitar', 'early', 'morning.The', 'premise', 'Looper', 'simple', 'why', 'kept', 'attention', 'where', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'more', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'wealth', 'redistribution', 'scheme', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Joe', 'who', 'be', 'alien', 'planet', 'other', 'Earth', 'crazy', 'dad', 'weirdo', 'brother', 'overly', 'masculine', 'older', 'sister', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'fellow', 'aliens', 'mission', 'Earth', 'house', 'aliens', 'have', 'earn', 'money', 'parts', 'Earth', 'work', 'capitalist', 'system', 'young', 'Joe', 'get', 'job', 'what', 'titular', 'Looper', 'refers', 'looper', 'basically', 'glorified', 'UPS', 'driver', 'who', 'also', 'moonlights', 'a/s/s/a/s/sin', 'older', 'people', 'side.One', 'day', 'young', 'Joe', 'meets', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', 'AKA', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'whom', 'older', 'self', 'Joe', 'older', 'self', 'now', 'out', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'collect', 'Social', 'Security', 'went', 'insolvent', 'back', 'year', '2020', 'thanks', 'Democrats', 'always', 'failing', 'address', 'insolvency', 'issue', 'Upset', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', 'AKA', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Joe', 'k/i/l/l', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'real', 'enemy', 'be', 'extremely', 'muddled', 'confusing', 'plot', 'movie', 'Now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dare', 'spoil', 'ending', 'respect', 'fellow', 'moviegoers', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'climatic', 'ending', 'involves', 'Joe', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', 'several', 'references', 'Obama', 'deputy', 'camping', 'manager', 'Stephanie', 'Cutter', 'many', 'unfounded', 'accusations', 'Mitt', 'Romney', 'ultimately', 'something', 'third', 'rock', 'sun', 'heck', 'loved', 'Looper', 'plan', 'buying', 'VHS', 'when', 'finally', 'out', 'home', 'video', 'several', 'months', 'now']",Looper

Written and directed by Rian Johnson it is another take on the concept of time travel (a topic that never seems to miss with audiences) and while the film is entertaining, it is very bloody and gory and the only salvation is the fact that the cast contains some of filmdom's more popular actors.The story is best summarized by the lead character in the film, Joe played with skill (despite phony makeup trying to make him resemble Bruce Willis - his looper self) by Joseph Gordon-Levitt: `I work as a specialized assassin, in an outfit called the Loopers. When my organization from the future wants someone to die, they zap them back to me and I eliminate the target from the future. The only rule is: never let your target escape... even if your target is you.'Or, stated another way, in 2074, when the mob wants to get rid of someone, the target is sent 30 years into the past, where a hired gun awaits. Someone like Joe, who one day learns the mob wants to 'close the loop' by transporting back Joe's future self (Bruce Willis). So the film opens in the year 2044, and Joe is a looper, friends with Seth (Paul Dano in a very brief appearance) and lovers with Suzie (Piper Perabo) and working for head looper Abe (Jeff Daniels).

Interesting idea, especially since each hitman is sent back as well at a certain age since the assassin company (or whatever) want to keep it on the hush-hush. So Joseph Gorden Levitt's future self is sent back to him, and after failing to kill his future self, they both have 2 contradicting objectives to complete, and yet they can't really interfere with each other since the butterfly effect and all. This is when the film was the most interesting for me, especially when they talk at a diner and they're both too stubborn to reason with each other.Then later it gets weird, Bruce Willis wants to kill a kid to save his future wife, ok that makes sense, but wait, the kid has super powers now? What? Sure, he wipes out all the crime bosses, but was this part really necessary? The tonal shift was too jarring for me to really get into it after that. Some kid having temper tantrums and blowing people up was cool to watch, but it detracted from the main story a lot. Why couldn't the kid just have been normal? Also I stopped taking the film seriously after I saw Bruce Willis, a man who lived his past 20 years in China with his wife, can apparently wipe out an entire organization of trained hitmen by himself. Also why does the organization that sends people back send the hitman to his younger self? Why not send it to someone else so that there's no risk of ""failing to close the loop"". There's a lot of that s*** in this film where it makes no sense and yet you're expected to go along with it.Maybe I'm disappointed because I came in with high expectations, but there's a lot of problems with the main story. There were many small touches to the film that were great, like Bruce Willis telling his younger self ""I can't look you in the eyes, this is too weird"", or Paul Dano's older self realizing that he just screwed himself over in a disturbing scene. Many little touches to the film were nice, but doesn't really mean much when the overall story is full of holes and tonally inconsistent.

1483911,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAII8K,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[2, 5]","Time travel. It's an idea that's so incredibly simple to start, but so amazingly hard to complete in a logical sense. For years, sci-fi film/TV geeks like myself have debated ad nauseam how certain films break the basic rules of time travel when one goes back in time, because no matter what, your actions are going to have consequences on the future. These possibilities of varying futures were discussed to some end in the film THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, but sadly, because it's not a very good film, it's made to feel trite. But here in writer/director Rian Johnson's LOOPER, those ideas are put to the test, and it's a test that it passes with flying colors in every aspect of the story it's telling.It begins in the year 2044. Time travel has been invented, but it's illegal. We have Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a specialized assassin called a ""looper"" who works for an organized crime syndicate whose boss (Jeff Daniels) is from the future. The deal is, when the mob wants someone disposed of, they send them back to the loopers (who know the exact time, date, and arrival point of the target) packed with bricks of silver as payment, the loopers kill them, incinerate the bodies and that's that. Although, the life expectancy of a looper (who are usually in their twenties) is only about their late 40's, and every so often, a looper is forced to kill their future self, which is termed ""closing the loop"" and then, the looper's contract is terminated, they get a big payday, and then go off and live the rest of their lives until they're sent back to die. But one day, Joe meets his adult self (Bruce Willis) as one of his contracts, and he escapes. This is not something the syndicate allows (as evidenced in one absolutely horrific scene), and the syndicate is sent after both the young and older Joe, despite the younger one's promise that he will find and kill his older self. This wild cat-and-mouse game sees the young Joe make his way to the rural outskirts of the giant city and to the farmhouse of Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon), while the older Joe is stalking the city for reasons of his own.Now if this was just another simple time-travel sci-fi action film that didn't give much thought to character, dialogue, or plot, it would be somewhat interesting but like THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, it would have fallen flat. But since this is Rian Johnson, a writer/director who is rapidly reaching a strange hybrid of journeyman AND auteur status with his two previous (and quite brilliant) films, the high-school neo-noir BRICK (also starring Gordon-Levitt) and the con man comedy-drama THE BROTHERS BLOOM (with Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Weisz), you're not getting the standard summer fare. Johnson very smartly spends less time dazzling us with millions of dollars of eye-popping set design of futurescapes and also concentrating solely on the action of the film, and gives us an ultimately fascinating character study of two men who are the same man, but products of two very different purposes and motives. We see the life that the younger Joe leads as well, which is a life of semi-luxury, endless clubbing, tough-guy posturing and drug addiction. We also get glimpses into the life that is eventually led by Joe after he ""initially"" closes his loop without incident, and we get a real sense of a man who will justify anything, including some pretty horrible things to prevent the future he knows is coming for him.Now this is not to say that Johnson skimps on the action or the set design. The future is a pretty dystopian place, littered with junker cars and super-sleek hovercycles, and no one is safe, unless you're one of the privleged. The action scenes have a breath-taking bravura that is intense, disorienting and highly stylized to fit Johnson's aesthetic. Even the weapons used have a strangely old-world feel to them, with huge old-west style pistols and the looper's blunderbuss which is a combo of future and past.The performances are excellent. This is absolutely Willis' best work in some time as he gives his aging killer real gravity and world-weariness as he ends up traveling to the past in order to fight his tragic future. Gordon-Levitt continues his streak of fascinating and layered performances and continues to show that he is one of the great actors of his generation (the prosthetic work done to make him look like a young Willis is pretty nice too). Emily Blunt is the major standout here, though, as the fierce-tempered Sara, who's only goal is to protect her son, despite what her son is and what he might become. Jeff Daniels and Piper Perabo don't have large roles, but what they do with them are substantial. The real discovery here is young Pierce Gagnon, who plays Cid with a number of different layers, which is surprising for an actor of his very young age. He never seems out of place in this film, and his performance is pretty amazing. Paul Dano and the (surprisingly) ever-menacing Garrett Dillahunt also do a great deal with small roles. Another fun character here is that of Kid Blue, a wannabe shootist (Noah Segan, another Johnson regular), who is both menacing and comical at the same time.The effects work here in this film is seamless as well, as some characters also display telekinetic ability (one much more so than the other), but is left largely alone in the film so that when it does happen, it happens with maximum effect. There is also a particularly disturbing sequence when one character fails to close his own loop and the syndicate gets their hands on the younger looper's self, and we see in real time what happens to the older self as the younger self is... well, you'll see.What makes this film so different from other time travel films is that you see actions and consequences not just in the physical world, but from a character perspective as well. There's an absolutely brilliant scene with the two Joes at a diner where they discuss the ideas of time travel, and as it's played by Willis and Gordon-Levitt, it not only helps put the whole idea of time travel in a unique perspective, but it also frames the events of the film in a way that no other time travel film has tried to do, or has done nearly as successfully.While those who are looking for a popcorn-munching action film are likely going to be disappointed by LOOPER, people who are looking for extremely intelligent, well-written, well-acted, well-directed sci-fi action fare will find themselves EXTREMELY pleased. LOOPER is indeed one of the best films of the year, and will likely find a better and more discerning audience at home than it could find in the theatres.",5,"Certainly one of the best of the year,

In 2074, time travel will be invented and immediately outlawed, used only by the most powerful criminal organizations to send people back to be executed without a trace. In 2044, Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a looper, an assassin that executes the targets sent from the future. Eventually, Joe's loop is set to be closed as he encounters an older version of himself sent to be killed. Looper is a mind-bending SciFi film, packed with action and thrills.Looper has a great story. The entire ""Looper"" concept is actually intriguing and innovative; assassins with targets from the future, with the fear of one day having your ""loop closed"". The first half of the film starts off with a fast pace and plenty of action sequences, while the second half slows down and focuses more on dialogue and story. There are plenty of memorable moments in this film, like Joe and Old Joe's first confrontation, and their confrontation in the diner, along with Old Joe's amazing shootout/escape sequence. Another concept/scene I enjoyed was the ""what happens to the 2044 you, scars the 2074 you""; for example, if a character loses a couple of fingers, the futuristic character also loses them in real time. There are more scenes I really enjoyed, but I rather not spoil the film. The ending of the film was also amazing, and unexpected; again, I won't comment any further to avoid spoilers. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis did an amazing job in this film, they were really able to match their personalities for this film. The music was also great. One of the minor flaws, in my opinion, was the lack of emphasis on the futuristic world; although it does briefly introduce the world, it doesn't create a fully-immersive experience, where you're eyes would often wander to view every detail of the environing. I would've enjoyed a bit more emphasis on the setting, but I understand the budget constraints. Another issue that I should bring up is Joseph Gordon-Levitt' appearance in this film: his appearance is different, most likely to match Bruce Willis (since they play the same character), but did not distract me at all. If you're worried about this, watch a clip or view a screencap (even the cover shows it) before paying.Overall, Looper is an amazing SciFi film, with a intriguing concept and stylish execution.

1483976,A5PGGHYHIDYA5,B005LAII8K,Kenton Couch,"[0, 0]","The movie ""Looper"" is a unique and imaginative film at a time when Hollywood often seems content to churn out formulaic productions loaded with special effects, sophomoric characters, and predictable plots. This movie, to its credit, has a plot you haven't seen before; and one where you won't, in all likelihood, predict the story's final outcome. For that alone, it is worth watching.Many may find the film a little slow, but the pace is the result of the moral and ethical ideas being presented: good and evil, the use and misuse of time travel, age and youth and their connection in time, how present events profoundly affect the future, nature vs. nurture, and the importance of a mother's love. The movie also paints a perhaps all too realistic view of the decadent future that may await us.The acting is first-rate, and a lot of hard work went into the making of the film. For this, I want to say thank you to the director, cast, and crew.I also want to note the superlative work Emily Blunt brought to her role. As in her other films, in ""Looper,"" Ms. Blunt gives us a class in what really fine acting is. Her performance has an honesty and depth which only comes from meticulous preparation and flawless execution. There isn't a moment in the film where you feel Ms. Blunt isn't completely the character she is portraying. Her skill and absolute commitment to her role make ""Looper"" a much better film than it would have been without her. She is, simply, one of our very best actors.So, when you watch this film, enjoy the hard work and genuine effort the director, cast, and crew put into the production. I also hope you are entertained by the story. And, finally, I hope you will enjoy and appreciate Ms. Blunt's fine acting in the film as much as I did.",4,Good Science Fiction - Emily Blunt Gives a Remarkable Performance,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,1765,"['movie', 'Looper', 'unique', 'imaginative', 'film', 'time', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'often', 'content', 'churn', 'out', 'formulaic', 'productions', 'loaded', 'special', 'effects', 'sophomoric', 'characters', 'predictable', 'plots', 'movie', 'credit', 'plot', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'one', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'likelihood', 'predict', 'story', 'final', 'outcome', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching.Many', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'little', 'slow', 'pace', 'result', 'moral', 'ethical', 'ideas', 'being', 'presented', 'good', 'evil', 'use', 'misuse', 'time', 'travel', 'age', 'youth', 'connection', 'time', 'how', 'present', 'events', 'profoundly', 'affect', 'future', 'nature', 'vs.', 'nurture', 'importance', 'mother', 'love', 'movie', 'also', 'perhaps', 'too', 'realistic', 'view', 'decadent', 'future', 'may', 'await', 'us.The', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'want', 'say', 'thank', 'director', 'cast', 'crew.I', 'also', 'want', 'note', 'superlative', 'work', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'brought', 'role', 'other', 'films', 'Looper', 'Ms.', 'Blunt', 'class', 'what', 'really', 'fine', 'acting', 'performance', 'honesty', 'depth', 'only', 'meticulous', 'preparation', 'flawless', 'execution', ""n't"", 'moment', 'film', 'where', 'feel', 'Ms.', 'Blunt', ""n't"", 'completely', 'character', 'portraying', 'skill', 'absolute', 'commitment', 'role', 'make', 'Looper', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'simply', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'actors.So', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'enjoy', 'hard', 'work', 'genuine', 'effort', 'director', 'cast', 'crew', 'put', 'production', 'also', 'hope', 'are', 'entertained', 'story', 'finally', 'hope', 'will', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'Ms.', 'Blunt', 'fine', 'acting', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did']",Looper

1483978,A2EP52TE6GH8OB,B005LAII8K,Kevin Millward,"[0, 4]","I will start off with what I liked most about this film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance as the younger Bruce Willis is nothing short of spectacular. In fact, his performance really sold the film and made it believable. Yeah, the makeup really helped, too, but JGL's sharp talent for transforming into another role (rather than mimicking it) completely changed the tone of the film. Looper easily could have been JGL chasing down Bruce Willis, but that was not the case. This was a young Bruce Willis chasing down an older Bruce Willis. Rather than the traditional man vs. man theme, this film effectively and creatively utilized the man vs. self theme, which I enjoyed.I also liked the visuals of this film. The futuristic world in this film is very feasible. I look at this world and think that it could actually exist someday. Rian Johnson clearly put a lot of thought into the setting. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography and editing was beautiful. This film distinguishes itself with its unique text, narration, and, most of all, fantastic camerawork. I wish I could describe the visual style of this film, but it is so unique and unlike anything I have ever seen before.As far as the acting goes, I really have no complaints. As I said before, JGL was brilliant. I'd say this is Bruce Willis' best film in years. I was skeptical about Emily Blunt's character, but I came to like her and was sold on the idea of her being a country girl. Even her kid was great. Usually, I hate little kids in movies. They are almost always obnoxious and are usually used for low-grade humor. This wasn't the case in Looper. I can't say much without giving away key plot points, but the boy's performance and role in the film is amazing.I really have no complaints about this film, other than how slow it can be. The trailer makes you think this will be a fast-paced action film, but much of the action in the trailer plays out as quick montages in the film, which was a little disappointing. I think I would have liked just a little more action, and with this film being just under two hours, it could have spared a few more minutes of that.Looper is a groundbreaking film on so many levels. It is well-written and thought-out, visually striking, and expertly acted. This film lived up to my high expectations, which is a rarity. Looper will definitely be added to my Blu-Ray collection.

If you too know nothing of it but love Blade Runner, Inception and other mind-benders, then stop reading these reviews and enjoy the many surprises awaiting you in Looper.Without spoiling anything, I'll just say I love a great time travel story, as it opens so many avenues of plot and thought, and this one avoids many of the usual cliches. Rian Johnson wrote a sweet, tight script and directed it to near perfection, getting fine performances from everyone and probably Levitt's best turn to date. The score is subtle but tense and fitting, the costumes likewise, and the sets and especially street shots are state of the art, very believably dystopian.What makes it all work are the concepts, some of which I've never encountered, and I've seen almost every time travel flick ever made; it's a genre I love. One thing the careful watcher will see over and over here are lens flares, which somehow fit in much better than usual (except in the work of Ridley Scott, the original flare-master). I don't think I've ever seen so many flares in one film, but Johnson always sets them up as part of the shot composition and it really works.

Confused? Looping time travel is what makes this film a little confusing.Director Rian Johnson (Breaking Bad, Brick) took his own original script but made it more philosophical and less about the characters. It was a little slow in getting its legs until of course you figured out who was the bad guy and what his objective was. Past meets future and future meets past. Yes, confusing at some points and a little more than weird in others.Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Inception, 500 Days of Summer) does an impressive job of not believing himself from the future but ultimately makes a choice that changes his own history.  It's like back To The Future II, rewriting the present to change the future and suffering the consequences, but BTTF was so much better! Oh and Joseph and Bruce are the same person. I'll say no more.Emily Blunt (The Adjustment Bureau, The Muppets) played an very troubled and intense mother of a boy who is more than what he seems. In fact, he is the key to the film and then in turn, the key to everyone in the films future. Pierce Gagnon (One Tree Hill) plays the son with enormous intensity and he has a great `evil' look that really sells the concept of what is going on. Pierce is very creepy too!Now a twist for a really great actor was Jeff Daniels (Dumb & Dumber, Speed) performance as a man with an ulterior motive and playing a baddie with some seriously weak henchmen! He is fun to watch and intense in the madness of his mission! Another notable performance is that of Paul Dano (There Will be Blood, Little Miss Sunshine) who really does fear and panic well. Paul also gives great motivation for the time travelling of Joseph and Bruce's character.I am being vague because it's hard not to say too much without giving things away. The film has a great empathic score by Nathan Johnson (Blue State, The Day I Saw Your Heart) and some basics time travel effects that keep the story first.Overall I was not impressed with the pace of the film. It took a long time to get going, but once it did it really did become interesting. Not a family film, but definitely film with a twisted family story.

Try, for instance, to make sense of the rules of time travel in Terminator and you'll end up with a headache  (only living beings can travel, but in the nude, except liquid metal resembling living beings can travel too, and sometimes the future can be changed but sometimes it can only be delayed, and so on).Looper does not make that mistake.  They cleverly handwave the rules in one piece of dialogue: ""It doesn't matter!"".  And they're right, it doesn't.  Time travel is just an accessory here.  A means to an end, which is telling a good, scratch that, a GREAT sci-fi story.On to the plot.  A looper is basically an executioner for hire.  Time travel doesn't exist in the time of loopers, but it will in the further future, outlawed, but still used in secrecy by organized crime.  In the future you can't get rid of a body, so they send them back in time where loopers do the killing and incinerating of the body.  There's a catch, though.  Every looper's last job is to kill their future selves (can't leave any loose threads), and they know that after they do that they retire and they have only 30 years more to live.  They accept it, knowing that their rewards will make up for their shorter life spans.Until one of them decides he won't accept it, and escapes his past self executioner in order to get rid of the future that allows a personal tragedy, and his own execution, to happen.This looper, Joe, is, of course, played by the main actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, both of whom do a fantastic job of portraying the same person in different ages despite the fact that they don't look much like each other.  They both do an exceptional job at showing a person who suffers changes in two different ways, as we see the same person changing from hero to villain from one perspective and from villain to hero from another.The rest of the cast also does a great job, with Emily Blunt being a highlight playing the lonely mother of a child who gets in the way of both incarnations of Joe, and Jeff Daniels as the man sent from the future to run the loopers.Don't let the naysayers, who get confused at one of the easiest to understand movies involving time travel, talk you out of watching this film.  They probably get confused by anything smarter than The Smurfs or Hanna Montana.  If you want a good, smart sci-fi film that is still easy to understand then watch this movie.

It falls into that famous category of science fiction movies because, well, as with most future dystopias, in the immortal words of Zardoz ""the future doesn't work."" :-)It's also a rollicking time travel tale with all the usual time travel paradoxes that we sci fi fans know and love, such as older and younger versions of the main character criss-crossing each other's time lines, the idea that time is ultimately a loop that coils back on itself, if you kill your grandfather, do you disappear (or vice versa), and other fun ideas that we're all familiar with.In this future dystopia, time travel has been achieved but outlawed presumably due to the possibility for misuse. This means that only the criminal organizations use it for their own nefarious purposes, using loopers who are sent back in time to dispose of people they don't like. The looper hit men are paid well and make a good living, but eventually their contracts expire, resulting in a situation where the older loopers are sent back in time to be killed by their younger selves so as to dispose of the evidence and ""close the loop.""There's a lot of violence and Bruce Willis is fun to watch as he repeatedly outwits and beats the bejesus out of his younger, overconfident, but not nearly as experienced self. It's sort of like watching a combination of his Diehard role and Time Bandits. The acting is top notch and the script is decent. Willis is able to convey volumes of dialog just with his eyes and facial expressions. In contrast, his younger self (don't recall the actor's name) hardly ever changes his facial expression, but instead imitates Willis's mannerisms. They made an interesting pair.

She's pretty much the usual woman who's trying to be tough but isn't and has to be rescued by the hero for most of the film. In the end, you see she has more grit than that but for most of the film, she's really not very strong and since she's played to be strong, it's annoying.

Oleson,"[4, 7]","Just like Ryan Gosling in 2011, it seems like Joseph Gordon-Levit is in every movie of 2012, most recently ""Premium Rush"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises."" In a 2006 film called ""Brick"" he hooked up with writer/director Rian Johnson for the first time.  A small film, it showed what Gordon-Levit could do as an actor.In this big budget collaboration, Gordon-Levit is Joe, a hit man of sorts called a looper from 2044 or thereabouts.  His job is to terminate men like him who are sent back from 30 years in the future. Time travel has become possible in the 2070's era but has been outlawed.  But the outlaws have managed to control it for their own use.All time travel films have their complications and while this is no exception, Johnson does a remarkable job keeping it simple.  He even goes so far as to set up a scene where old Joe (Bruce Willis) confronts young Joe in a caf&eacute; about how he not only managed to escape, but what life would be like in the next 30 years.  Old Joe essentially tells him not to over-think the time travel aspect.  The same for the viewer.As hinted above, old Joe comes back but avoids the ""termination"" by his younger self by not being bound with a bag over his head.  This surprises young Joe enough for old Joe to get the advantage.  After old Joe escapes, young Joe must follow and kill him or his own existence will be jeopardized.  This chase along with that of a goon squad summonsed by Abe (Jeff Daniels), the man in charge, becomes more complicated because old Joe is also on a mission to kill a young boy.This boy (remarkable Pierce Gagnon) will grow up to have a major influence as the head of the criminal empire of the future and the man who decides to kill all of the older loopers (called closing the loop).  As both young and old Joes center in on the boy, yet another wrinkle develops.  The boy's mother (great performance by Emily Blunt) becomes entangled with young Joe.  All of this leads to a conclusion, unexpected but satisfying.Yes, this is a thinking person's sci fi and yes, you need to pay attention, but it isn't beyond comprehension.  Terrific performances enhance the film which is soaked with adrenaline and tense action sequences. Even the requisite shoot out seems authentic.  Johnson's two future worlds are not filled with spiffy flying cars and laser guns, nor is it a bleak, smog filled world.  It pretty much looks a lot like now with enough evolution to seem real.

Then Loopers start getting sent back future version of themselves when they are no longer needed.

In the case of this movie, we have time travel as the maguffin. Criminal organisations of the future now have access to time travel, and use it to dispose of people they want rid of, sending them back to &#8216;loopers&#8217; - assassins who are paid by the bars of silver attached to the victims.  This arrangement is lucrative for the loopers, but has one drawback &#8211; one day they will be asked to &#8216;close the loop&#8217;, when their own future self is sent back for disposal, so that no future police force can identify who is breaking the law outlawing time travel.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the key performer here, more so than Willis &#8211; though it&#8217;s always absurdly satisfying to see our Bruce pick up a machine gun and start wrecking the place..  Willis is Levitt&#8217;s future self, but when sent back to be killed by his younger self things don&#8217;t go according to plan, and they both end up on the run, with both converging on the farmhouse of Emily Blunt and her son. At least, that&#8217;s where things kick off.. this set up is just a starting point for an intriguing set up to an unexpected showdown.

Contradictions and silliness abound. Characters are both dead and alive at the same time. They have arms and don't have arms at the same time. We learn later in the film, for example, that the lead character kills himself as a young man but he also makes it into old age (and performs acts such as saving an even younger version of himself from certain death). Characters fear their imminent death yet also know they survive into old age. There are so many other silly contradictions and lazy, hackneyed plot devices that I couldn't enjoy any of the action scenes or other aspects of the film (which now I think about also were rather substandard). It's written by someone who clearly don't have any clear, original ideas (actually it faces many of the contradictory time travel plot scenarios as the Back To the Future movies).Those who can hold a complex, logical thought or two in their heads will likely be disappointed by this movie and maybe even feel a little insulted by the laziness of the screenwriter.

Perhaps there is no better confirmation of the confused nature of time travel movies than an admission by the screenwriters that the concept is simply too screwy to explain.  That is what we get at least twice during this movie: scenes between various characters trying to puzzle out how time travel works, especially when you are supposed to kill your future self.  Never mind, the scriptwriters tell us.  Don't try to diagram it out.  We were totally stoned when we wrote the story, anyway.What is this story?  It is bits and pieces from science fiction and horror movie ideas of the last 30 years or more:  a little bit of Matrix and Dark City (mostly costumes), a little bit of Star Wars (jet-powered motorcycles), how about some Damien (The Omen) or a blood-soaked little boy version of Carrie?  Poltergeist anyone?  Futuristic psychedelic drugs?  Ugh.  Not to mention the 50 other time travel movies out there that make no sense.  Get an original idea, please.So the present is the 2040s--or maybe it is the past.  And the future is the 2070s--or maybe it is the present.  People from the future (present?) are being sent back to the present (past?) for execution.  That works for about 30 minutes, if you are adjusting the surround sound by moving furniture around your living room and not paying any attention to the movie.  After that, with the totally cool idea of ""loopers"" totally exhausted, the movie wanders around hopelessly, desperately searching for a way to fill out another 60 minutes of reel time, no pun intended.Note to Bruce Willis fans:  Even though he is given top billing, he is actually in a supporting role.______________________________* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category.

This has been a great year for scifi & fantasy and LOOPER's a big reason why.  Mix in equal helpings of BLADE RUNNER, SCANNERS, and TIME COP (plus a little WITNESS for seasoning) and you get a styled, original film that never bores.  While we've seen everything featured in LOOPER before in other films, we've never quite seen it put together quite like this.As written and directed by Rian Johnson, LOOPER never hesitates in it's far out plot - it's set in 2044 and the time travelers come from some 40 years later - so much so that the time travel gimmick becomes very believable (a very hard trick to pull off).  That's partly because there's plenty of other hardcore scifi gimmicks  - rayguns, flying cars, and psychic powers - also make appearances.  Despite all the chances for missteps, Johnson's direction is crisp and never chooses style before story, instead letting the action dictate the camera work.The film's helped by a great cast - Bruce Willis is great of course, but so is Jeff Daniels as a mob boss, as is Joseph Gordon Levitt and Emily Blunt.  Very solid, very professional performances all the way around.  None of them get overwhelmed by a story that could have very easily turned into a farce.Far out plot aside, this movie works quite well as a detective story.  It also plays on our expectations of what we want from our Hollywood stars.  The music, camera work, costumes are all top notch.  Makeup plays a big role, as Levitt wears a ""Bruce Willis"" nose that doesn't always work, but that about the worst thing I can say about this otherwise must see flick.4 ""Sweet!

1484123,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B005LAII8K,RJ Smoove,"[0, 0]","Looper is a Science Fiction gem. Writer/Director Rian Jonson's personal passion project possesses one of the rarest traits in today's film industry, originality (apologies for all the p's). I really liked Looper a lot when I first saw it in the theater, and I loved it the second time at home. I loved it because it drew me in. Not only the story itself, or the plethora of rich characters, but also the dark dystopian future world that Johnson created. I totally bought into everything I saw, and it made the story feel more personal to me.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my favorite young actors working. He brings a charisma, and a maturity to the screen every time. He's uniquely great here because of the Bruce Willis impression he is trying to pull off, meanwhile still adding a personal touch to his younger version of the character that he and Bruce share. Not only are they great, but also the supporting cast which consists of Jeff Daniels, Paul Dano, Emily Blunt, Noah Segan and great kid named Pierce Gagnon who does one of the most intense creepy looks. He's truly a good find for the role he plays.I will avoid any sort of plot description, because one of the greatest parts of the film is discovering everything as the plot unfolds. What I will say that the film is complex without being complicated. It's nice to be able to think and analyze while watching a modern Sci-Fi flick. That's not as common as it used to be. As for the Blu-ray treatment, it's top notch.The disc is practically reference material. The picture quality is sublime. Detail is sharp, and colors are rich. The audio definitely is, it's sonic. The sound design is sure to rumble some home theaters. As for the extras, they are pretty good as well. I am a sucker for commentaries, especially on personal projects like this. Johnson delivers a fascinating commentary during both the film and the deleted/extended scenes.The featurettes are fairly short, which is the biggest drawback, but there should be enough here to satisfy most who even bother to venture into the special features section of the disc. I do not have much else to say about this film, because my gushing over how great the film is would probably grow tiresome, but I can't recommend it enough.

Richards,Noah Segan as Kid Blue,Piper Perabo as Suzie,Jeff Daniels as Abe,and others.This film starts out at a fine pace,introducing us to its main characters and what they do,then everything comes to a screeching halt as the movie slows to a crawls pace and then until it drags into the finish line.This is not what I was wanting to see of a film like this with so much promise.The story has Levitt as a looper.This is 2044 and loopers are basically just hit men.The twist is they hit peeps from the future that are sent back by crime syndicates,who are finding it hard to dispose of bodies in their time.Each hit has the payment attached to their backs,whether it be gold or silver bars.Jeff Daniels is a part of a crime syndicate from the future and is in 2044 overseeing operations.The initial kick and big money is the draw for folks that want to become loopers in the first place.The drawback is is that sometimes the people from the future will randomly decide that they want no witnesses at all to their hit's death,including the loopers that kill them.So the loopers themselves can become instant targets also.One day Levitt is awaiting his hit,but it is late.When it does arrive it is himself(Willis),but older.Willis escapes and Levitt's butt is suddenly in a sling,and Levitt is now on the run from Daniels and his posse.Levitt and Willis do meet up,at which point rumours of a new future crime syndicate takeover by a man known as the Rainmaker,are confirmed.Willis has a number scrawled on his hand which he got from a friend in the future.It is the birth date and the hospital which the baby Rainmaker was born in.The task now is to kill the Rainmaker.Levitt goes to a farm where a single mother lives with her son.Willis in the meantime seeks out two other possibilities and dispatches both.One of Daniels men finds Levitt and the child,but before the man can kill him the child kills the man.It seems the child has telekinetic skills of greater proportions than is the norm for 2044.It is then Levitt realizes that this is the Rainmaker.Willis meanwhile kills Daniels and his men right in their headquarters,then comes to the farm to kill the child.As Willis pursues the mother and her child across a cut cornfield,one of Willis's shots grazes the child and angers him.He ends up levitating his mother and Willis,but the mother calms him down enough for him to drop them both.Levitt in the meantime had tried escaping but the air blast from the child's initial rage has turned over his vehicle.An injured Levitt seeing Willis pursue the boy and ready to shoot the mother,decides to stop the child growing up to become the Rainmaker due to what circumstances would do to change him.Levitt kills himself,and of course Willis disappears.The film as I said was moving along wonderfully and I was enjoying this kind of neat concept about loopers and what they do and why.However,when the plot took Levitt to the farmhouse,the film suddenly slowed to a snails pace and never regained the flow it had had previously.To get from Levitt's first introduction to Blunt,the mother of the future Rainmaker,to the end was interminably long and got very boring VERY fast.The director obviously had details and plot to tell,but this entire sequence of events should have been whittled down and edited with much more alacrity.As it was it spoiled(or me)what had come before and took away from an otherwise promising film.This was a very disappointing turn of events,but poop does happen unfortunately.As far as performances go,I have got to give Willis most of the credit with being the driving force of this film.Levitt is not as likable a lead actor as the producers would have us think and his performance was far too weak to be in the drivers seat.When Willis comes on the movie crackles with intensity and lights up.Without Willis,the ""lights"" dim considerably.I also found Jeff Daniels to be in top form also as the syndicate rep in 2044.I hadn't seen Jeff in ages and it was a nice change of pace role for him.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include deleted scenes,commentary,a featurette,the scoring and an animated trailer.All in all a disappointing Sci-Fi flick,that SHOULD have been far better.It had a great concept and moved along well until Levitt goes to the farmhouse,and then the pace falters considerably.Willis is THE star here because Levitt just does not have the acting chops yet to carry the leading man role.",3,Rolling.....up to a point.,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,4624,"['Looper',

This movie was very well made and surprisingly good. The storyline is a new concept, which is produced very well and with a very nice ending. The romance and bedroom scenes are well done; they leave you with just enough to use your imagination without offending anyone. That&#8217;s the mark of seasoned producer, and I really appreciate that. The cinematography is stunning. Acting, wardrobe, and props are very good.

Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, a cynical blunderbuss carrying hitman, who assassinates individuals sent from the future so that no bodies are left in their present. Thirty years in the future, theloopers are themselves sent down the line to be offed by their younger self, this is called closing the loop. As he makes clear, this job doesn't attract forward thinkers.Joe has plans to retire, learn French and live out his days in Europe. When his loop is compromised by his older self (Bruce Willis), who has come back prepared to take it on the lam. The older Joe isn't interested in just running to save his own life, he has a plan to search out the leader of a future criminal organization and kill him. This leaves Gordon-Levitt's Joe in a tight spot that he hopes to get himself out of by hiding out on a farm with a woman (Emily Blunt) and her 10 year-old son, Cid (Pierce Gagnon). Their roles in all this becomes more clear as the two Joes prepare for a final face off.A complicated plot, twisty as time travel tales often are. Happily, it all seems to come together in a bold unexpected ending. I saw the movie in a full house, when the credits come up there is no outro music and the audience was stone silent in pleasant surprise. Kudos to Johnson's excellent, well thought out and provocative script.This is Johnson's third film, following the brilliant high school neo-noir Brick, which failed to find an audience partially because of it's cold narrative and unusual structure. His second film was the slight, but slightly wonderful romantic comedy adventure the Brothers Bloom. Looper is his best movie so far, I can't wait to see what this unique and very talented filmmaker comes up with next, it will almost certainty be something fresh and original. A talent to keep an eye on for sure.In his supporting role,  top-billed Willis shows that he is still every bit an action star, but he also gets a chance to remind us that he is an underrated character actor who has anchored more than his share of tough dramatic roles over the years. This is not just his best movie in a long while, but his best role in years. He has a tricky part here, he is neither hero, nor villain, managing to be equal parts of both while maintaining audience identification. A common man action star like Gene Hackman in his day, Willis should be allotted more roles like this.Jeff Daniels is also very good, an unlikely casting choice, stealing his few scenes as a gangster and cast against type as the movie's lead villain. Gordon-Levitt and Daniels were previously in the excellent, but little seen heist thriller the Lookout. Daniels is a good actor often wasted in forgettable roles, not so here.Make no mistake though, this is Gordon-Levitt's movie, having previously starred in the director's Brick, the part was written for the young actor. A formidable presence and one of the very best actors of his age, Gordon-Levitt has been in a number of good films, giving solid performances, yet has remain relatively unknown up to this point. Under some impressive make-up to resemble a young version of Willis, this should be the film that makes stardom no longer aloof for the talented young actor.Dealing with themes of regret and repentance, as well as moral affecting choices things such as predication versus free will. Johnson has written an existentially moody script, it's not a heavy handed or pretentious one and should appeal to those who have enjoyed the best work of Christopher Nolan, in the past. The plot twists are well handled and followed through to their inevitable conclusions. The movie that Looper most makes me think of is Le Jette and it's English language remake, the Bruce Willis starrer 12 Monkeys. Looper is as smart as people think Inception is and as smart as Minority Report wanted to be.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",5,a smart action movie,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,4263,"['Time', 'travel', 'movies', 'generally', 'are', 'exercises', 'style', 'substance', 'aim', 'be', 'pleasing', 'often', 'succeed', 'Rian', 'Johnson', 'Looper', 'be', 'as', 'smart', 'be', 'as', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'smart', 'thriller', 'not', 'afraid', 'trust', 'audience', 'willing', 'think', 'still', 'enjoy', 'themselves.Starring', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'set', 'vivid', 'understated', 'future', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Joe', 'cynical', 'blunderbuss', 'carrying', 'hitman', 'who', 'individuals', 'sent', 'future', 'bodies', 'are', 'left', 'present', 'Thirty', 'years', 'future', 'theloopers', 'are', 'sent', 'down', 'line', 'be', 'offed', 'younger', 'self', 'called', 'closing', 'loop', 'clear', 'job', ""n't"", 'attract', 'forward', 'thinkers.Joe', 'plans', 'retire', 'learn', 'French', 'live', 'out', 'days', 'Europe', 'When', 'loop', 'compromised', 'older', 'self', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'prepared', 'take', 'lam', 'older', 'Joe', ""n't"", 'interested', 'just', 'running', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'plan', 'search', 'out', 'leader', 'future', 'criminal', 'organization', 'kill', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Joe', 'tight', 'spot', 'get', 'hiding', 'out', 'farm', 'woman', 'Emily', 'Blunt', '10', 'year-old', 'son', 'Cid', 'Pierce', 'Gagnon', 'roles', 'more', 'clear', 'two', 'Joes', 'prepare', 'final', 'face', 'off.A', 'complicated', 'plot', 'twisty', 'time', 'travel', 'tales', 'often', 'are', 'Happily', 'come', 'together', 'bold', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'saw', 'movie', 'full', 'house', 'when', 'credits', 'come', 'outro', 'music', 'audience', 'was', 'stone', 'silent', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Kudos', 'Johnson', 'excellent', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'provocative', 'script.This', 'Johnson', 'third', 'film', 'following', 'brilliant', 'high', 'school', 'neo-noir', 'Brick', 'failed', 'find', 'audience', 'partially', 'cold', 'narrative', 'unusual', 'structure', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'slight', 'slightly', 'wonderful', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'Brothers', 'Bloom', 'Looper', 'best', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'unique', 'very', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'up', 'next', 'will', 'almost', 'certainty', 'be', 'something', 'fresh', 'original', 'talent', 'keep', 'eye', 'sure.In', 'supporting', 'role', 'top-billed', 'Willis', 'still', 'bit', 'action', 'star', 'also', 'chance', 'remind', 'underrated', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'anchored', 'more', 'share', 'tough', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'years', 'not', 'just', 'best', 'movie', 'long', 'while', 'best', 'role', 'years', 'tricky', 'part', 'here', 'hero', 'villain', 'managing', 'be', 'equal', 'parts', 'maintaining', 'audience', 'identification', 'common', 'man', 'action', 'star', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'day', 'Willis', 'should', 'be', 'allotted', 'more', 'roles', 'this.Jeff', 'Daniels', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'unlikely', 'casting', 'choice', 'stealing', 'few', 'scenes', 'gangster', 'cast', 'type', 'movie', 'lead', 'villain', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'Daniels', 'were', 'previously', 'excellent', 'little', 'seen', 'heist', 'Lookout', 'Daniels', 'good', 'actor', 'often', 'wasted', 'forgettable', 'roles', 'not', 'so', 'here.Make', 'mistake', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'movie', 'having', 'previously', 'starred', 'director', 'Brick', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'young', 'actor', 'formidable', 'presence', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'actors', 'age', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'been', 'number', 'good', 'films', 'giving', 'solid', 'performances', 'yet', 'remain', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'up', 'point', 'impressive', 'make-up', 'resemble', 'young', 'version', 'Willis', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'stardom', 'no', 'longer', 'aloof', 'talented', 'young', 'actor.Dealing', 'themes', 'regret', 'repentance', 'as', 'well', 'moral', 'affecting', 'choices', 'things', 'such', 'predication', 'free', 'will', 'Johnson', 'written', 'existentially', 'moody', 'script', 'not', 'heavy', 'handed', 'pretentious', 'one', 'should', 'appeal', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'best', 'work', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'past', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'well', 'handled', 'followed', 'inevitable', 'conclusions', 'movie', 'most', 'think', 'Le', 'Jette', 'English', 'language', 'remake', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'starrer', '12', 'Monkeys', 'Looper', 'as', 'smart', 'people', 'think', 'Inception', 'as', 'smart', 'Minority', 'Report', 'wanted', 'be.see', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",Looper

So what's really great about Looper is that the movie strays away from even trying to explain the hows and what-ifs. Looper sticks to the simple story of a scenario where time travel does indeed exist, and what happens to the life of an assassin when a criminal organization is using time travel to send those they want killed into the past to said assassin.Director Rian Johnson gets great performances out of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Young Joe) and Bruce Willis (Old Joe). Johnson's make up crew does an astounding job making Levitt physically resemble a young Willis, and Levitt captures many of Willis' signature personality traits to really enhance the believability of the movie. Levitt (and Willis) must have had a lot of fun with this film.So the story really takes flight when Willis himself is sent back in time to meet the end of Levitt the assassin's suped-up shotgun.

1484167,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B005LAII8K,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 0]","a young man kills for a living, without apparently any problem with it, gets high, dresses well, parties with his friends, drives a nice car, and sleeps with his favorite prostitute.  Later, because it's a time travel science fiction film, he meets an older version of himself (Bruce Willis), who figures out he must kill 3 kids, and this may perhaps save his future, beloved wife.  Most of the film is death, destruction and unpleasantness, with a few minutes of redemption at the end.  Unappealing story unsympathetically told, though the actors are good.  If the filmmaker was determined to show the work habits and lifestyle of an unrepentant assassin, I'd have preferred he'd shown the assassin's origin story, which may have at least allowed the audience to generate some sympathy for the lead character, if say, for example, he'd been forced by circumstance and lack of other options into his career choice.  As presented though, I don't understand what value the writer thought this story would have for his audience - it's not entertaining to see a male character kill over and over and over again, bound, gagged, kneeling victims which the assassin murders and whose remains he discards unceremoniously in a furnace.  I read that critics said the assassin fell in love with the Emily Blunt character, but I saw no sign of that - I saw a sex scene between them, not love.  The assassin seemed to sympathize with the rainmaker child, because the assassin himself was abandoned by his mother, and he and the child had a conversation - if anything there was a connection between the assassin and the rainmaker, but the child was written so creepily, it diluted the audience's ability to care for him, except of course we don't want a child murdered.  So, basically, no place to connect to the story emotionally for the audience; the assassin was presented doing his job, in the first 10 minutes or so we see him murder maybe 8 people, can't connect to a character like that; Emily Blunt's character enters the story in an unappealing manner - the only glimmers of positive feeling I saw the characters share were between the Bruce Willis character and his wife, and the Emily Blunt character and her devil spawn son; these glimmers were brief though, and not enough to attach an audience, i.e., to help an audience get emotionally involved in the story.  And if a storyteller is not trying to get his audience to care, why tell the story.Additional thoughts - I suspect the writer had an idea of his story being a learning curve for his lead, who experiences an epiphany at the story's end and is able to compare, by how destructively he's led his own life, and how other characters tell him the rainmaker as an adult brings death/destruction on others, that the lead needs to kill himself (which will stop his older self, Bruce Willis, from killing the rainmaker's mother), and that this sacrifice might stop the future violence of the rainmaker - that perhaps the only way the rainmaker will not become a monster, will be to allow him his mother's care and guidance during his childhood.  The problem for the audience is this realization comes to the lead at the story's end, long after he has been established in the story as a cold blooded killer of many, including the murder of an innocent child his Bruce Willis self erroneously suspects as being the rainmaker child.  The lead is totally unsympathetic to the audience by the time he makes his sacrifice, so the value of the sacrifice is almost entirely lost on us.  The writer needed to have his lead do something positive long before his sacrifice, before he met the rainmaker child, to help the audience see him as something other than an assassin, which, after all, the writer establishes his lead as being.  A story is a proof, an argument - the writer wants to change a villan into a hero over the course of his story; he successfully introduces his lead as a villan (unrepentant assassin), but fails in transitioning him into a hero within the story in a believable way.  A single heroic act at the story's end doesn't make the lead a hero, it just confuses the audience to see a character who has been previously established as a villan, out of the blue, perform a heroic act.  If the writer wants his lead to be a hero, he needs to write situations in the story which allows the audience to witness the lead's path to heroism.  Basically, the writer didn't give enough evidence (information) of the lead's heroism over the course of the story.  In his next effort, I hope the writer will do better - he nailed the villan part, giving plenty of evidence, and I see where he wanted to go; he just left out two or three situations where a good guy vibe for his lead was required, and the audience needed to witness those scenes before the lead met the rainmaker and the rainmaker's mother.",2,didn't care for it ...(spoilers),1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,4858,"['young', 'man', 'living', 'apparently', 'problem', 'high', 'well', 'parties', 'friends', 'nice', 'car', 'sleeps', 'favorite', 'prostitute', 'Later', 'time', 'travel', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'older', 'version', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'out', 'must', 'kill', '3', 'kids', 'may', 'perhaps', 'save', 'future', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Most', 'film', 'death', 'destruction', 'unpleasantness', 'few', 'minutes', 'redemption', 'end', 'Unappealing', 'story', 'unsympathetically', 'told', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'determined', 'show', 'work', 'habits', 'lifestyle', 'unrepentant', 'assassin', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', ""'d"", 'shown', 'assassin', 'origin', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'least', 'allowed', 'audience', 'generate', 'sympathy', 'lead', 'character', 'say', 'example', ""'d"", 'been', 'forced', 'circumstance', 'lack', 'other', 'options', 'career', 'choice', 'presented', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'value', 'writer', 'thought', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'audience', 'not', 'entertaining', 'see', 'male', 'character', 'kill', 'over', 'again', 'bound', 'gagged', 'kneeling', 'victims', 'assassin', 'murders', 'remains', 'unceremoniously', 'furnace', 'read', 'critics', 'said', 'assassin', 'fell', 'love', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'character', 'saw', 'sign', 'saw', 'sex', 'scene', 'not', 'love', 'assassin', 'seemed', 'sympathize', 'rainmaker', 'child', 'assassin', 'was', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'child', 'had', 'conversation', 'anything', 'was', 'connection', 'assassin', 'rainmaker', 'child', 'was', 'written', 'so', 'creepily', 'diluted', 'audience', 'ability', 'care', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'child', 'murdered', 'So', 'basically', 'place', 'connect', 'story', 'emotionally', 'audience', 'assassin', 'was', 'presented', 'doing', 'job', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'see', 'murder', 'maybe', '8', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'connect', 'character', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'character', 'story', 'unappealing', 'manner', 'only', 'glimmers', 'positive', 'feeling', 'saw', 'characters', 'share', 'were', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'character', 'wife', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'character', 'devil', 'spawn', 'son', 'glimmers', 'were', 'brief', 'not', 'enough', 'attach', 'audience', 'i.e.', 'help', 'audience', 'get', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'story', 'storyteller', 'not', 'trying', 'get', 'audience', 'care', 'why', 'tell', 'story.Additional', 'thoughts', 'suspect', 'writer', 'had', 'idea', 'story', 'being', 'learning', 'curve', 'lead', 'who', 'epiphany', 'story', 'end', 'able', 'compare', 'how', 'destructively', 'led', 'own', 'life', 'how', 'other', 'characters', 'tell', 'rainmaker', 'adult', 'death/destruction', 'others', 'lead', 'kill', 'will', 'stop', 'older', 'self', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'killing', 'rainmaker', 'mother', 'sacrifice', 'might', 'stop', 'future', 'violence', 'rainmaker', 'perhaps', 'only', 'way', 'rainmaker', 'will', 'not', 'become', 'monster', 'will', 'be', 'allow', 'mother', 'care', 'guidance', 'childhood', 'problem', 'audience', 'realization', 'lead', 'story', 'end', 'long', 'been', 'established', 'story', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killer', 'many', 'including', 'murder', 'innocent', 'child', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'erroneously', 'being', 'rainmaker', 'child', 'lead', 'totally', 'unsympathetic', 'audience', 'time', 'sacrifice', 'value', 'sacrifice', 'almost', 'entirely', 'lost', 'writer', 'needed', 'have', 'lead', 'do', 'something', 'positive', 'long', 'sacrifice', 'met', 'rainmaker', 'child', 'help', 'audience', 'see', 'something', 'other', 'assassin', 'writer', 'lead', 'being', 'story', 'proof', 'argument', 'writer', 'change', 'villan', 'hero', 'course', 'story', 'successfully', 'lead', 'villan', 'unrepentant', 'assassin', 'transitioning', 'hero', 'story', 'believable', 'way', 'single', 'heroic', 'act', 'story', 'end', ""n't"", 'make', 'lead', 'hero', 'just', 'audience', 'see', 'character', 'who', 'been', 'previously', 'established', 'villan', 'blue', 'perform', 'heroic', 'act', 'writer', 'lead', 'be', 'hero', 'write', 'situations', 'story', 'audience', 'witness', 'lead', 'path', 'heroism', 'Basically', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'evidence', 'information', 'lead', 'heroism', 'course', 'story', 'next', 'effort', 'hope', 'writer', 'will', 'do', 'better', 'nailed', 'villan', 'part', 'giving', 'plenty', 'evidence', 'see', 'where', 'wanted', 'go', 'just', 'left', 'out', 'two', 'three', 'situations', 'where', 'good', 'guy', 'vibe', 'lead', 'was', 'required', 'audience', 'needed', 'witness', 'scenes', 'lead', 'met', 'rainmaker', 'rainmaker', 'mother']",Looper

They had a few moments where they could have developed their characters more and allowed them to really act, but they just left them bland. The film crept at a slow pace, at some point I thought it would pick up but it never did. I also thought there would be more action then there was. Even the final scene was pretty calm. They had the potential to make some sweet fight scenes but it just never happened. The ending was really lame, it wasn't anything huge or emotionally gripping, it didn't leave me in shock and aww or wanting more. It was more of a, ""oh...that kind of sucks"" feeling. I also felt like they were leading the audience to side with Willis, wanting him to carry out his mission, but then the ending just threw it all out the window.

1484178,A26MJME9IBNETY,B005LAII8K,StrangePegs,"[1, 3]","Time travel stories are... difficult. Star Trek is proof of that. I think two things play into it: 1. No one can agree on how time travel would actually work if it's possible. Or if it's possible. 2. Because of that, writers like to use it as a magic wand. It's one of those things I kind of hate in science fiction, when the writer uses some bit of science like it's magic just because no one knows how it works. If you want to write magic, go write fantasy.Still, all in all, I don't think the time travel was handled too poorly in Looper other than the constant paradoxes that were never addressed. What I have a problem with is being lied to, and, in essence, the movie hinges on a lie, and that really bothers me.Now, I don't have a problem with being deceived through sleight-of-hand and trickery. The Sixth Sense is so great because Shyamalan  never lied to the audience. He laid everything out there for us to see and allowed us not to see it. A couple of movies that are very similar except that one lies and one doesn't are The Prestige and The Illusionist (which I talk about for a bit here). The Illusionist achieves its climax by lying to the audience (through omission) all the way through, which is the only reason we are unable to piece the plot together. I really have no respect for that.Now, if you haven't seen Looper, there will be spoilers.The whole story of Looper hinges on  the belief by the audience that young Joe dies when he falls from the ladder. At that point, the movie jumps back as if that is the moment that causes the reset. When it starts over, we accept that we are seeing a different time line because of the presentation, and it's not true. It's not like in The Sixth Sense when Crowe gets shot. Afterward, the audience just assumes that Crowe didn't die even though Shyamalan tells us several times, &#34;look, this guy's dead.&#34; We just can't see it. In Looper, the truth is never offered until the end, when the lie is revealed, and that's just a cheap way of doing it.To make matters worse, the director or the writer or someone comes out and tells us that the movie isn't going to make any sense and not to think about it. Young Joe and Old Joe are sitting in a diner together, and Young Joe asks Old Joe about time travel, and Old Joe says, &#34;I don't want to talk about time travel because, if we start talking about it, then, we're going to be here all day talking about it, making diagrams with straws.&#34; Rough translation: &#34;Don't think about it; just watch the movie. We can't explain it either.&#34; On the one hand, I'm glad they're honest about it. &#34;Look, we just want to tell our story, so don't go trying to logic it, because it won't make any sense.&#34; [And it doesn't.] On the other hand, I'm kind of insulted. It says to me that they didn't want to bother with telling a story that makes sense, which devalues me as the audience. And, then, they lie to make it work.The other thing that really bothers me is that the movie didn't happen, and I hate stories that didn't happen. I hate getting to the end and finding out that it was all a dream or a vision or a whatever. I mean, this was as bad as Next with Nicolas Cage. You get to the end and find out that, really, the movie ended right there when Young Joe kills Old Joe at the beginning of the movie. That's it. End of story. Everything else is just &#34;closing the loop&#34; and doesn't actually exist. I really felt cheated.Even so, there are some good moments in the film. When Old Seth is trying to get to Young Seth and losing body parts all along the way... man, that's just freaky. It doesn't make any sense from a paradox perspective, but it's creepy enough that you don't care. The horror of that moment as his fingers start disappearing is gut wrenching. Also, I really liked Paul Dano as Young Seth.There's a lot of humor, dark humor, in the fact that Old Joe keeps beating the crap out of his younger self. There's the urge to slap Young Joe for not listening to his older self, but, then, that's how all kids are, right?  And there's the fact that the good guys don't win. How could they? There are no good guys. But there aren't a lot of movies these days where the protagonist (hero or anti-hero) fails, and that's almost enough to make Looper worth watching all by itself.If you're willing to just turn your brain off and watch and if you don't mind being lied to, Looper is definitely worth your time, just don't ever say, &#34;But why...?&#34;Oh, also, a big part of why Looper works is the inherent belief of the audience (and that includes me) in the badassness of Bruce Willis. There is nothing in the movie to support Joe being any kind of badass. In fact, he's more of a loser, drug addict than anything else. However, because our image of Willis is that he's a badass, we don't question him single-handedly taking down a criminal organization even though there is nothing in the movie to support this.",3,Believing the Lie,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,4956,"['Time', 'travel', 'stories', 'are', 'difficult', 'Star', 'Trek', 'proof', 'think', 'two', 'things', 'play', '1', 'one', 'can', 'agree', 'how', 'time', 'travel', 'would', 'actually', 'work', 'possible', 'possible', '2', 'writers', 'use', 'magic', 'wand', 'one', 'things', 'kind', 'hate', 'science', 'fiction', 'when', 'writer', 'bit', 'science', 'magic', 'just', 'one', 'how', 'want', 'write', 'magic', 'go', 'write', 'fantasy.Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'time', 'travel', 'was', 'handled', 'too', 'poorly', 'Looper', 'other', 'constant', 'paradoxes', 'were', 'never', 'addressed', 'What', 'have', 'problem', 'being', 'lied', 'essence', 'movie', 'lie', 'really', 'bothers', 'me.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'being', 'deceived', 'sleight-of-hand', 'trickery', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'so', 'great', 'Shyamalan', 'never', 'lied', 'audience', 'laid', 'everything', 'out', 'there', 'see', 'allowed', 'not', 'see', 'couple', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'one', ""n't"", 'are', 'Prestige', 'Illusionist', 'talk', 'bit', 'here', 'Illusionist', 'climax', 'lying', 'audience', 'omission', 'way', 'only', 'reason', 'are', 'unable', 'piece', 'plot', 'together', 'really', 'have', 'respect', 'that.Now', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Looper', 'will', 'be', 'spoilers.The', 'whole', 'story', 'Looper', 'hinges', 'belief', 'audience', 'young', 'Joe', 'when', 'ladder', 'point', 'movie', 'back', 'moment', 'reset', 'When', 'accept', 'are', 'seeing', 'different', 'time', 'line', 'presentation', 'not', 'true', 'not', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'when', 'Crowe', 'shot', 'Afterward', 'audience', 'just', 'Crowe', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'even', 'Shyamalan', 'several', 'times', '34', 'look', 'guy', 'dead.', '34', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'Looper', 'truth', 'never', 'offered', 'end', 'when', 'lie', 'revealed', 'just', 'cheap', 'way', 'doing', 'it.To', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'director', 'writer', 'someone', 'out', 'tells', 'movie', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'sense', 'not', 'think', 'Young', 'Joe', 'Old', 'Joe', 'are', 'sitting', 'diner', 'together', 'Young', 'Joe', 'Old', 'Joe', 'time', 'travel', 'Old', 'Joe', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'talk', 'time', 'travel', 'start', 'talking', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'here', 'day', 'talking', 'making', 'diagrams', 'straws.', '34', 'Rough', 'translation', '34', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'either.', '34', 'one', 'hand', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'re"", 'honest', '34', 'Look', 'just', 'want', 'tell', 'story', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'trying', 'logic', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.', '34', '[', ""n't"", ']', 'other', 'hand', ""'m"", 'kind', 'insulted', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'bother', 'telling', 'story', 'sense', 'audience', 'then', 'lie', 'make', 'work.The', 'other', 'thing', 'really', 'bothers', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'hate', 'stories', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'hate', 'getting', 'end', 'finding', 'out', 'was', 'dream', 'vision', 'mean', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'Next', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'get', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'really', 'movie', 'ended', 'right', 'there', 'when', 'Young', 'Joe', 'Old', 'Joe', 'beginning', 'movie', 'End', 'story', 'Everything', 'else', 'just', '34', 'closing', 'loop', '34', ""n't"", 'actually', 'exist', 'really', 'felt', 'cheated.Even', 'so', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'film', 'When', 'Old', 'Seth', 'trying', 'get', 'Young', 'Seth', 'losing', 'body', 'parts', 'way', 'man', 'just', 'freaky', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'paradox', 'perspective', 'creepy', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'horror', 'moment', 'fingers', 'start', 'disappearing', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'Also', 'really', 'liked', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Young', 'Seth.There', 'lot', 'humor', 'dark', 'humor', 'fact', 'Old', 'Joe', 'beating', 'crap', 'younger', 'self', 'urge', 'slap', 'Young', 'Joe', 'not', 'listening', 'older', 'self', 'then', 'how', 'kids', 'are', 'right', 'fact', 'good', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'win', 'How', 'could', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'movies', 'days', 'where', 'protagonist', 'hero', 'anti-hero', 'almost', 'enough', 'make', 'Looper', 'watching', 'itself.If', ""'re"", 'willing', 'just', 'turn', 'brain', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'being', 'lied', 'Looper', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'say', '34', 'why', '34', 'Oh', 'also', 'big', 'part', 'why', 'Looper', 'inherent', 'belief', 'audience', 'badassness', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'nothing', 'movie', 'support', 'Joe', 'being', 'kind', 'badass', 'fact', 'more', 'loser', 'drug', 'addict', 'anything', 'else', 'However', 'image', 'Willis', 'badass', 'do', ""n't"", 'question', 'single-handedly', 'taking', 'down', 'criminal', 'organization', 'even', 'nothing', 'movie', 'support']",Looper

1484193,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B005LAII8K,The People's Critic,"[0, 0]","Every fall season a movie comes along that lacks the hype and pandering for an audience. Instead, it is released and looks to succeed by word of mouth. Last year that film was the still under-appreciated Drive; this year my top contender is Looper.Looper begins by introducing us to Joe, a barely recognizable Joseph Gordon-Levitt who performs the title task as a ""Looper."" Looper is a time-travel story, but roots itself firmly in a mostly-recognizable version of the near future. The only major difference is that time travel is invented soon after the present setting of the film, which allows for a somewhat confusing, but well executed, original story. Loopers are hired guns who kill for a futuristic mob that sends their hits 30 years into the past before time travel was invented. This allows for mob enemies to simply disappear in their present time and be disposed of in an earlier time when they wouldn't be investigated. Loopers are paid well to shoot first, ask no questions, and most of all be punctual as hits will suddenly appear in a predetermined location at an exact time. Allowing a ""loop"" to ""run"" results in some very unsavory consequences. The downside to Looping is that one day, every Looper's loop must close, which means the future version of yourself will be sent back for immediate execution. When this happens, a Looper gets a big final pay day and 30 years to enjoy it before the inevitable.The premise for this film is imaginative and dealt with in a surprisingly cohesive way by director Rian Johnson. As with all great time-travel films, rules must be established so that the viewer may understand exactly what the limits are within these multiple dimensions. I provided a short discussion about some classic time travel theories in a previous blog post that you can read here. In short, this particular film's view is similar to the Back to the Future variety where you can co-exist with multiple versions of yourself and events that affect the younger version will also impact the later version. Thus, when Joe finds himself face to face with his older self, played by Bruce Willis, he inadvertently allows him to run. However, Willis' character can not simply run since he knows the consequences against Gordon-Levitt will affect him too.The story's arc is much more far-reaching and complex than a cat-mouse chase between alternate versions of Joe. As we learn more about Joe's future from Bruce Willis, our sympathies are toyed with and our moral centers are jarred endlessly. Johnson's screenplay and direction provide powerful and conflicting motivations for both characters, making the movie deeply engaging and surprisingly fresh. Additional story lines regarding a futuristic crime boss (Jeff Daniels), a fellow Looper (Paul Dano), and farmhouse mother and her son (Emily Blunt and an Oman-esque Pierce Gagnon, respectively) all flesh out this film and give it real dimension and pragmatism, regardless of its sci-fi, time travel plot.Looper is a tightly wound, entertaining film that has something for everyone to enjoy. There is a slight dragging feeling at the close of its second act, but this perceived lull is making way for a strong and dominant conclusion. In summary, this review only touches on the surface of what Looper accomplishes; there are multiple surprises in store for all audiences who see it, so let the word of mouth begin!

This, of course, is a statement aimed at the audience, who are likely to ask questions about how time travel works according to the ""Looper"" universe.So out of respect for this review, I will try not to poke holes at the time travel rules. But there are way too many questions to ask, especially when it comes to the logic of certain characters.SPOILERS AHEAD! Do not read if you haven't seen!1. Abe, the mob boss from the future who was sent back from the future to run the present-day mob, goes out of his way to explain to Young Joe (read: the audience) that it is dangerous to have someone from the future running around in the past/present. If that's true, why is Abe there? Does his younger self in the year 2044 know about him being there?2. Why would the mob mandate that loopers in the present day kill their own future selves? It's extremely risky to assume that anyone would be okay with doing such a thing. It's already risky enough that they hire junkies, some of them with telekinetic powers, to do their dirty work. Are they trying to test the loopers' loyalty? Are they just being sadistic? It would seem more logical to send the future retired loopers to other looper assassins, and therefore keep them in the dark about their ultimate fate. This would make them much more obedient too.3. So we learn early on in the film that whatever happens to people in the present will carry the effects to people in the future, including body mutilation and death. And this happens no matter what timeline the future people are living in. So why did the mob in the present find it necessary to cut off Young Seth's body parts in order to lure Old Seth just so they can fatally shoot Old Seth before eventually killing Young Seth? Why didn't they just shoot Young Seth in the head? They would have literally killed two birds (or, men) with one stone (or, bullet) without so much blood and carnage. And as we clearly see at the end of the film, if you kill someone in the present, including yourself, their future selves will cleanly disappear, even if their future selves are residing in the present. My only guess is that the mob wanted to be extremely sadistic and dole out the worst punishment possible to anyone who lets someone from the future run loose, especially if it's themselves. And speaking of killing your future self...4. How does Sara know about loopers? Young Joe seems surprised that she knows, and he asks her about it. But she never answers.5. What exactly does Young Joe accomplish by killing himself at the end? Old Joe tells Young Joe in the diner that the Rainmaker ""saw his mom get shot."" Now of course, that was somewhere during the original timeline where Old Joe does not survive his execution. But what that means is that the rainmaker apparently rose to power even without any interaction from Old or Young Joe. Why didn't he at least try to kill Old Joe? Old Joe wouldn't be able to retaliate without seriously hurting himself. And even if Old Joe succeeded in killing Sara so that he could get to Cid, it would have given Young Joe all the time he needed to kill Old Joe and try to find Cid. He could then use his excessive amount of silver and gold to raise Cid in a positive environment. After all, Cid likes Young Joe, and he's a smart kid, so Cid would be a low-maintenance child to care for. And if he succeeded in protecting Sara, then his job would be even easier with the two-parent household, AND his enormous sum of money. Not to mention the fact that Old Joe killed the rest of the mob in the present day, so they're safe from their enemies.If Young Joe was serious about killing Old Joe, he should have done it when Old Joe pulled up in front of him and told him to go ""live your life,"" instead of shooting randomly at the truck that Old Joe was driving when he clearly could have hit him.",3,"Great concept, but still leaves questions unanswered",1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,3973,"['When', 'watch', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'will', 'urge', 'younger', 'self', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'forget', 'space-time', 'continuum', 'stuff', 'course', 'statement', 'aimed', 'audience', 'who', 'are', 'likely', 'ask', 'questions', 'how', 'time', 'travel', 'according', 'Looper', 'respect', 'review', 'will', 'try', 'not', 'poke', 'holes', 'time', 'travel', 'rules', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'ask', 'especially', 'when', 'logic', 'certain', 'characters.SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'Do', 'not', 'read', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '1', 'Abe', 'mob', 'boss', 'future', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'back', 'future', 'run', 'present-day', 'mob', 'way', 'explain', 'Young', 'Joe', 'read', 'audience', 'dangerous', 'have', 'someone', 'future', 'running', 'around', 'past/present', 'true', 'why', 'Abe', 'there', 'younger', 'self', 'year', '2044', 'know', 'being', 'there', '2', 'Why', 'would', 'mob', 'mandate', 'present', 'day', 'kill', 'own', 'future', 'selves', 'extremely', 'risky', 'assume', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'doing', 'such', 'thing', 'already', 'risky', 'enough', 'hire', 'junkies', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'Are', 'trying', 'test', 'loopers', 'loyalty', 'Are', 'just', 'being', 'sadistic', 'would', 'seem', 'more', 'logical', 'send', 'future', 'retired', 'loopers', 'other', 'looper', 'assassins', 'therefore', 'keep', 'dark', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'would', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'obedient', 'too.3', 'learn', 'early', 'film', 'people', 'present', 'will', 'carry', 'effects', 'people', 'future', 'including', 'body', 'mutilation', 'death', 'matter', 'what', 'future', 'people', 'are', 'living', 'why', 'did', 'mob', 'present', 'find', 'necessary', 'cut', 'off', 'Young', 'Seth', 'body', 'parts', 'order', 'lure', 'Old', 'Seth', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'fatally', 'shoot', 'Old', 'Seth', 'eventually', 'killing', 'Young', 'Seth', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'shoot', 'Young', 'Seth', 'head', 'would', 'have', 'literally', 'killed', 'two', 'birds', 'men', 'one', 'stone', 'bullet', 'so', 'much', 'blood', 'carnage', 'clearly', 'see', 'end', 'film', 'kill', 'someone', 'present', 'including', 'future', 'selves', 'will', 'cleanly', 'disappear', 'even', 'future', 'selves', 'are', 'residing', 'present', 'only', 'guess', 'mob', 'wanted', 'be', 'extremely', 'sadistic', 'out', 'worst', 'punishment', 'possible', 'anyone', 'who', 'someone', 'future', 'run', 'loose', 'especially', 'speaking', 'killing', 'future', 'self', '4', 'How', 'Sara', 'know', 'loopers', 'Young', 'Joe', 'surprised', 'never', 'answers.5', 'What', 'exactly', 'Young', 'Joe', 'accomplish', 'killing', 'end', 'Old', 'Joe', 'Young', 'Joe', 'diner', 'Rainmaker', 'saw', 'mom', 'get', 'shot', 'Now', 'course', 'was', 'somewhere', 'original', 'timeline', 'where', 'Old', 'Joe', 'not', 'survive', 'execution', 'what', 'rainmaker', 'apparently', 'rose', 'power', 'even', 'interaction', 'Old', 'Young', 'Joe', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'least', 'try', 'kill', 'Old', 'Joe', 'Old', 'Joe', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'retaliate', 'seriously', 'hurting', 'even', 'Old', 'Joe', 'succeeded', 'killing', 'Sara', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'Cid', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Young', 'Joe', 'time', 'needed', 'kill', 'Old', 'Joe', 'try', 'find', 'Cid', 'could', 'then', 'use', 'excessive', 'amount', 'silver', 'gold', 'raise', 'Cid', 'positive', 'environment', 'Cid', 'Young', 'Joe', 'smart', 'kid', 'Cid', 'would', 'be', 'low-maintenance', 'child', 'care', 'succeeded', 'protecting', 'Sara', 'then', 'job', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'easier', 'two-parent', 'household', 'enormous', 'sum', 'money', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'Old', 'Joe', 'killed', 'rest', 'mob', 'present', 'day', ""'re"", 'safe', 'enemies.If', 'Young', 'Joe', 'was', 'serious', 'killing', 'Old', 'Joe', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'when', 'Old', 'Joe', 'pulled', 'up', 'front', 'told', 'go', 'live', 'life', 'instead', 'shooting', 'randomly', 'truck', 'Old', 'Joe', 'was', 'driving', 'when', 'clearly', 'could', 'have', 'hit']",Looper

Looper is the brainchild of Rian Johnson, who likes to bring us unusual stories, that mainly star JGL, however Looper is much easier to follow than most of Johnson's other films. While I'm not his biggest fan, his attention to detail has always really stood out to me and is perhaps never more evident than in Looper. Johnson actually used make-up and special effects to make JGL resemble a young Bruce Willis, which I found to be ingenious. Not to be overlooked is of course how clever a story Looper is, as it blends together time travel and the mafia. In the future, time travel has been invented, but like every other good thing, it is illegal. The mafia controls time travel and uses it as a weapon to commit murder. In this future world, it is impossible to dispose of a body, so the mafia sends their targets back in time where they are met an executed by a hired gun, known as a looper. The performances are of course top notch, Willis, the action star of a generation, only gets better with age, and JGL is the simply put the hardest working, most under appreciated actor in all of Hollywood.

There is a set of rules for disposing the victims, but the most important is that you cannot let anyone escape - even if your next target is yourself.After the fairly entertaining first 30 minutes, ""Looper"" quickly loses momentum, looking for a story to tell. Unfortunately, the best Rian Johnson could think of seems to be the ""TK"" idea, which only makes the film's second half so predictable. The impressive cast is doing a good job, but despite their effort, it is hard for me to care any one of the characters they play. Also, Emily Blunt and Piper Perabo are both wasted.Any films about time-travelling have some inherent flaws which I will not repeat here.

That pretty much entails killing off their future selves after they get sent back to the past. Yep, plot holes commence... So the drama here starts when Joe, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, has to kill his future Joe, played by Bruce Willis. He hesitates, action and chaos ensues. If the Looper can't close the loop, the mob gets pretty pissed off, and they have severe means of fixing this problem.Without spoiling anything, I'd say that this ranks as one of the better time-travel films out there, but it's pretty predictable and makes your head hurt from thinking about all the scenarios that can play out from all the time travel issues. JGL plays young Joe very convincingly and mimicks Willis' mannerisms quite well. Freakishly well in some scenes. He prevents this film from being boring or tired. Bruce Willis is, well, Bruce Willis. He pretty much plays the same role in every movie he's in so no difference here. Emily Blunt does a fine job, sans British accent as a single mom raising an interesting boy, who certainly can create further holes in this movie.The movie looks wonderful in Blu-ray and the soundtrack is enjoyable as well.Looper is a decent film, but a frustrating one. Maybe I am thinking too much into it, but there are so many possibilities when it comes to time travel, so many theories out there, that I can't help but nitpick when something sounds or looks off. The ending just offered more questions, and nothing conclusive really happened. Still, it's worth a look.",3,"Good, not anything special or innovative",1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,2235,"['problem', 'time-travel', 'movies', 'matter', 'what', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'always', 'there', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'actual', 'proof', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'alot', 'room', 'creative', 'freedom', 'Looper', 'place', 'year', '2044', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'flying', 'cars', 'yet', ""'re"", 'way', 'Joe', 'young', 'Joe', 'Looper', 'kind', 'hired', 'gun', 'Time', 'travel', 'been', 'invented', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'illegal', 'apparently', 'only', 'mob', 'capable', 'hire', 'Loopers', 'take', 'care', 'people', 'send', 'back', '30', 'years', 'future', 'Loopers', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'silver', 'gold', 'doing', 'gig', 'sometimes', 'are', 'forced', 'close', 'loop', 'pretty', 'much', 'entails', 'killing', 'off', 'future', 'selves', 'get', 'sent', 'back', 'past', 'Yep', 'plot', 'holes', 'commence', 'So', 'drama', 'here', 'when', 'Joe', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'kill', 'future', 'Joe', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'action', 'chaos', 'ensues', 'Looper', 'ca', ""n't"", 'close', 'loop', 'mob', 'pretty', 'pissed', 'off', 'have', 'severe', 'means', 'fixing', 'problem.Without', 'spoiling', 'anything', ""'d"", 'say', 'one', 'better', 'time-travel', 'films', 'there', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'head', 'hurt', 'thinking', 'scenarios', 'can', 'play', 'out', 'time', 'travel', 'issues', 'JGL', 'young', 'Joe', 'very', 'convincingly', 'mimicks', 'Willis', 'mannerisms', 'quite', 'well', 'Freakishly', 'well', 'scenes', 'film', 'being', 'boring', 'tired', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'well', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'role', 'movie', 'so', 'difference', 'here', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'fine', 'job', 'British', 'accent', 'single', 'mom', 'raising', 'interesting', 'boy', 'who', 'certainly', 'can', 'create', 'further', 'holes', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'Blu-ray', 'soundtrack', 'enjoyable', 'well.Looper', 'decent', 'film', 'frustrating', 'one', 'Maybe', 'am', 'thinking', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'possibilities', 'when', 'time', 'travel', 'so', 'many', 'theories', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'nitpick', 'when', 'something', 'off', 'ending', 'just', 'offered', 'more', 'questions', 'nothing', 'conclusive', 'really', 'happened', 'Still', 'look']",Looper

In ""Looper"", Willis (this time sharing the screen with Joseph Gordon-Levitt) once again gets time-travel right.For a basic plot summary, ""Looper"" is set in a future where time travel isn't invented yet...but will be in thirty years, primarily used by the mob to get rid of their ""dirty laundry"".  Each day, Joe (Gordon-Levitt) waits in a field and guns down time-looping individuals as they appear.  One day, however, Joe must ""close the loop"" on himself by killing the older version of himself (Willis).  When the time comes, though, Young Joe hesitates and Old Joe does not, leading to an interesting scenario filled with astounding possibilities.Where ""Looper"" primarily succeeds (like ""12 Monkeys"" before it) is that it perfectly walks the fine line of successful time travel fiction: it doesn't come off as hokey, yet it doesn't spend too much time deconstructing the science involved.  This is a story about people and their relationships, with the time travel being the vehicle towards that end.  It also gives the viewing mind a lot to think about.Only helping matters is the acting of the two leads.  It is absolutely astounding how Gordon-Levitt was made to look like a young Willis.  He is almost unrecognizable from his previously roles in films like ""Inception"" or ""Dark Knight Rises"".  Their chemistry with each other is both intense and interesting, a fact that is only bolstered by the fact that they are one in the same person!Overall, ""Looper"" is just a well thought-out time-travel flick that also packs a ton of drama and character emotion.

1484240,AB1CKA6B849SP,B005LAII8K,zeus,"[3, 7]","This is an OK movie with an OK plot. The acting is really good and Cid (Pierce Gagnon), the little kid, saves the movie. Bruce Willis is well, ...Bruce Willis nothing exceptional, nothing earth shuttering. Just your usually Bruce from Die Hard.The year is 2040 (...or around there) and people live a peaceful life in a futuristic society with a lots of poverty and cars that look that were made in 2000 (!). Time travel was not invented yet. But, it was invented in the future (30 years later) and immediately was outlawed and only available on the black market. In addition, the mafia (in the future) cannot kill people freely because everybody has an ID and it is difficult to make someone disappear. And as always the mafia found a solution. They send the victims in the past to be killed by the ""loopers"". The loopers are just killing machines. They kill people and make them dissapear. Essentially the victims never existed. However, now and then a looper must be terminated too (closing the loop). So the mafia sends the looper back from the future (older) with a lot of gold. Basically the looper kills his older self. He has 30 years remaining in his life which he can enjoy by spending the gold on drugs, hookers, air bikes etc.And life goes on with everybody partying, doing drugs, sleeping with hookers, until things are getting complicated because Joe (the young version played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fails to kill the old Joe (Bruce Willis). However, Bruce Willis is mad (as always) because the mafia killed his wife (in the future) while apprehending him. So he sends himself in the past to find the guy who changed society drastically (the rainmaker) and kill him while he is a 10-year old kid. Like this his wife will not be killed (in the future). Here, now you have the plot! Deal with it...There are a lot of things wrong with this movie but the cars are the most important inaccuracy that jumps at you. All cars look like today's cars. Even the cars around 2070 look like todays cars. The pickup truck that Emily Blunt drives (Cid's mother/babysitter) is like the one that was made yesterday. So while we have invented time travelling we just didn't make anything better than an SUV or a pickup truck? Hum...Another problem: Emily shoots young Joe in the right shoulder, old Joe (Bruce) feels it and touches his right shoulder were he has the scars, and two scenes later Emily is taking care of young Joe's left shoulder. Come on people, check the scenes, don't be so arrogant, and make an effort. Why are you (the Hollywood crowd) assuming that some people are not going to notice? Not everybody who watches movies is an idiot, a low information voter. This attitude makes total sense with your political convictions and the fact that you really believe that you are part of some kind of ""elite"" (or the ""Hollywood nomenclatura"") and the little people (us) don't know much. Wake up! You depend on us.This is an average movie with an average scenario/plot and of course an ending that MUST be politically correct. That is the problem with the Hollywood movies. They must be PC. While the ending was somehow unexpected, it didn't make any sense. If the ending stands, then the movie and the plot should not exist (...probably for the better). Old Joe wouldn't have all these problems because old Joe.....!!Three stars because of the kid (Cid). He is just an unbelievable actor and he has great facial expressions.PS, If you really want to understand what I mean about having movies with PC endings, watch the two versions of ""The vanishing"".
