The main character, Gwynn Marcus, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, is engaged to her boyfriend Matt.  Matt is the one for her and she knows it.  But she second-guesses the relationship because she has family members whose expectations of marriage are based on fantasy.  On top of that, her parents drive each other crazy and commit adultery behind the other's back.  Matt, feeling that she isn't self-assured ends their relationship; and I can't blame him.

377434,ABFJYHVD8RHLE,6303486738,Hillary,"[10, 17]","Here is a film that is so negative about the possibilty of finding true love, it should be banned from sale or rental to all engaged couples.  In fact, anyone who has a positive outlook on relationships and doesn't wish to wallow in the mire of adultery, divorce and human failure, should skip it altogether.  I think that covers everyone who is not one of the characters in this film, or similarly inclined.Sarah Jessica Parker who is the only saving grace here, is Gwen, an engaged lady who is surrounded at every turn by dysfunctional relationships.  This film is not even close to reality at any point.  No one knows this many unhappy people buried in illicit tawdry affairs, even if they live in Hollywood!  In fact, this film tries so hard to be NOW and HIP and COOL,  like this is what you can expect from todays relationships.  Totally absurd.  Gwens mom, played my Mia Farrow, is having an affair with her mothers aka Gwens grandmothers nurse, played by Antonio Banderas in an earlier fleeting role.  Makes you wonder why he got later roles.  Gwens dad is terribly upset, but mom reveals HE has been having plenty of affairs for years too.  Big surprise!  What is Gwen to do?  Go to her brother for advice, of course.  She arrives in the middle of a fight between him and his pregnant wife, they couldn't possibly be cooing on the couch happily now could they?  Of course not.  What is THEIR fight about?  His affair with his partners model wife Naomi Campbell.  Wow, let's play the interracial card  possibilities here into the film for a little added zest!  Of course, she isn't a single model, I said partners WIFE.  Yet another wayward spouse to add to an ever growing roster of remorse.  There is just NO hope for this family or anyone they touch illicitly in cheap brightly painted motels.So there you have the basics.  Everyone is married, everyone is miserable.  They're all cheaters, liars, adulterers, and just not any sort of example for poor Gwen to reason herself into not being afraid of the possibilty of her own marriage.  The poor girl, even I got depressed at the whole situation.If you want to watch a movie that emphasizes all the negative possibilities of married life, here is a perfect film for the committment shy to bolster his or her argument.  However, if you still believe in true love and happily ever after, you will want to avoid this like the plague.  Especially don't watch this with anyone you love.  Some romantic comedy, it sends a message to the faithful like THEY have the problems.  If you are curious, go ahead and watch.

Take  Antonio Banderas's turn parodying himself and the &quot;suave latino  lover&quot; typecasts, or Carla Gugino's bubbly charm. Of course, good  things always may come hand-in-hand with lackluster spots... one of the  biggest here? Naomi Campbell sitting pretty and saying her lines with as  much enthusiasm as a laptop computer with a british accent. She is typecast  alrigtht, but instead of playing with the possibilities like Banderas did,  she just walks by, remarkably far from fantastic.Now that brings another  contrast, for Gil Bellows' performance as Matt, the understated and  understanding fiance is nothing short of great. His smile can lit up a room  (common knowledge) and yet when he has to unburden his anger and pain he  does it in a way that is quiet and convincing. No high drama, no storming  through doors. His character is a man in love but pushed too hard by his  beloved (Parker) so his empathy is believable to a fault. His is one of the  most delightful moments of the film, including the possibility of salvage  at the closing.

377437,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6303486738,Mr. Cairene,"[6, 12]","Miami : A major U.S. city on the Southern tip of Florida. Rich with Hispaninc culture, affluent yuppies and tropical weather. An ideal location for a film-maker hoping the colorful locale would distract the audience  from his apathetic and empty film.Rhapsody : 1-(Music)Romantic  composition in irreglar form 2- Express enthusiasm or delight in speech.  Here I suspect the word is borrowed from Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue which  was featured heavily in Woody Allen's Manhattan. More on that later.David Frankel's abysmal 1995 &quot;romantic comedy&quot; is neither  romantic or comedic. Its stars Sarah Jessica Parker as Gwyn, a sitcom  writer who is having cold feet about marrying her zoolgist boyfriend Matt  (Gil Bellows). In her anxiety, she goes to other members of her family to  see how their own marriages are going, and perhaps find heartwarming  stories that could encourage her to take that big step. From then on the  script operates like a wind up toy. She goes to a loved one, asks about  his/her marriage, and that loved one then proceeds to narrate a supposedly  humorous horror story about his/her relationship. The big band score kicks  in as their little, self absorbed and bitter stories unfold. Will she  conquer her fears and get back to the man of her dreams, have you seen one  movie in your life?Then again, romantic comedies are not really  about plot, but the company of the characters that take you through it. And  unfortuantly our heroine Gwyn is a neurotic, self absorbed idiot who  suffers diarrhoea of the mouth spewing out hollow, cheap one liners that  would embarrasse a gossip columnist. By the end of the film you won't be  concerned weather they make up or split up just as long as they shut up.Now we come to the Woody Allen question. There is a pretty thick line  that seperates a homage and a rip-off. And here Frankel lifts Allen's style  so completely that it enters the realm of criminal plagerism. What he  forgot to steal however was the wit, charm and underlying poignancy that  makes Allen's neurosis lovable. Even's Allen's worst film, the pointless  Celebrity is infinitly more watchable .Miami Rhapsody's only virtue  is Jack Wallner's luminous photgraphy, he makes the city come alive with  bright reds, browns and other tropical delights. The look of the film is  why I suffered it to the very end, perhaps its not such a good thing then.  To quote Roger Ebert's review of another film &quot;this film is not merely  bad, its unpleasant in a hostile way&quot;.

377440,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6303486738,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[7, 7]","Miami Rhapsody stars Sarah Jessica Parker as Gwynn Marcus, one of several sibs of a prominent, wealthy, Jewish and dysfunctional family in Miami.  Though things seem okay on the outside, tangled relationship problems threaten every quarter of the family.  Her brother Jordan (Kevin Pollack) cheats on his pregnant wife with a high-strung model (Naomi Campbell); Her sister's (Carla Gugino) new husband is a pro-football player plagued by career insecurities and terminal cheapness; both of her parents (Mia Farrow and Paul Mazursky) cheat on each other; and she remains unhappy if only because she's the sort of person who's so concerned about happiness that she must strangle the happiness out of wherever it pops up in her life.  Though she's engaged, Gwynn soon finds herself attracted to the male nurse (Antonio Banderas) who cares for the family's stroke-ridden grandmother.""Rhapsody"" is a lot like an overlong episode of ""Sex and the City"" without the neat closure of that show's half-hour snippets or the materialism or communal honesty of that show's leads.  Gwynn obsesses over Miami and sex, noting that both are extremely popular despite the inherent messiness of either.  I had never seen ""SatC"" when catching this flick back in '95.  Instead I recognized the flick as more of a parody of Woody Allen movies - the sort of rambling flick centered around a city (not NYC this time) and the hang-ups of those who endure it.  The cinematography, Gwynn's neuroses (the film opens with Gwynn lamenting to a therapist), casting of Mia Farrow and even the opening credits hint at one of those small Woody Allen flicks that breezes through town without warning.  ""Rhapsody"" works mostly on its stars' ernestness but also depends on some familiarity with that sort of Woody-ish kind of film.  I doubt anybody who's never seen an Allen film will find this film more than amusing.
