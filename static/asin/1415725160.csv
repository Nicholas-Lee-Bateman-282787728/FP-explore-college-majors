And I do mean a thang or two, as I only know two people of the four-man group.  Now I ain't a fan of the troupe, because I like to think I am sorta sophisticated on comedy, but I gotta ask to y'all: ain't Jeff Foxworthy a household name to country folks?  Why ain't he taking charge and star in lots of big comedy movies?  How in tarnation is a guy like him, who seems clean and friendly to everybody he be pleasing with, is second to Larry the Cable Guy's load of films?  The ev'ryday redneck, of all Blue Collar comedians, got to lead in three movies (that is three too got dang much) and he even was acartoon tow-truck.  Kinda depressin' that he be a leading man for a movie like Health Inspector, which don't impress me none.From what the story is, Larry is an unlikely health inspector who goes from one restaurant to another to check for some infestations and such, making sure them restaurants are the cleanest places to go.  He was ordered byBiff Tannento pardner up with a tomboyish bookworm gal to observe the pro at play.  They be looking in other places, fighting their odd diff'rences until they found, like, some kind of conspiracy that someone's sabotaging the restaurants so they can win a cooking show for their own personal gain.  Larry don't want that to happen, so he and the boy-girl are on the case. Ironically for a health inspector such as hisself, the man lives in a pigsty.  Y'all understand the word 'irony'?  'Irony' is, like, somethin' that is the opposite of what it is s'pose to be or act.  Y'see, his job is to make sure the restaurants are spotless, and he don't even clean up after himself.  That's the joke, and I am explainin' this to you because this movie thinks you an idjut, like many of them jokes where Larry had to explain why they funny.  I may type like a poorly-done stereotypical redneck, but I would not treat the movie folks like that.I could be talkin' more about unfunny them poopy jokes are, how the characters don't seem to give any better laughs, or how this movie ripped that one toilet scene fromDumb and Dumber, but the thang is, Health Inspector is just ain't for me.  As much as I dun hated his work, he did has an audience that people look up to and this is strictly for these folks.  This is a kinda movie I tend to avoid, but I gave it a chance, I was willin' to see if there is more to Larry than being a flannel shirt and trucker hat-wearing dimwit.  But he is exactly what he looks, and this film ain't converting me to being a fan of his stuff.  I do say that the characters had a few nice qualities about demselves, even the insulting mental one fromdat Foosball spoofis a decent guy, and the film don't try to hurt nobody's feelings, no joke about those.

And the in the words of Brent from Season 6 Apprentice!  YOU ALL  STANK!!!!I rented this movie, on the recommendation of a very Movie Oriented friend of mine, named Bobby Asslong.  I think this might be the last recommendation I take from him on comedies.  He seems to favor the bodily function Gross Out Humor films, and I find they are tasteless and vulgar!Okay, like another reviewer here, I'm not a prude.  I saw ""Date Movie"" and actually thought it was pretty funny.  But there was a big difference.  It wasn't 90% gas and bodily function humor.  This movie was over the top in the Gross factor!  Sorry, when the lady he is trying to attract, is getting the uncomfortable look on her face, listening to him squeeze off gas, as he sits there, supposedly wining and dining her, it makes me feel uncomfortable for her, and most importantly, I stop laughing.  Which would be counter to what a comedy movie is supposed to make you do.  You see my point?Story-line:  Okay, that actually was a strong point, though it was a pretty lousy story, and would not win any awards, this factor does allow it to rise above other ""gross out"" humor movies like the Satire movies put out in an almost monthly basis.  Of course, there were no earth stopping moments, or amazing cliff hanger plotlines, but I actually found myself curious who and why somebody was poisoning patrons.Low Budget: At the end, when they are rolling credits, and showing film, I assumed that they were showing some type of bloopers, but the story was continuing, and we were seeing new scenes.

His new movie though was a head scratcher, it's not a five star classic but it definetely gets enough of a recamendation.The story is enough to fill the slim running time of the movie.  Larry is a slob, plain and simple.  His giant truck is a redneck eyesore, his personal habits and mannerisims are disgusting, he drives his boss nuts and his new partner he keeps thinking is a guy.  Larry is also a health inspector and may be the best one in the city but it's for all the aforementioned traits I listed above plus a destructive streak while on the job that keeps him on the 2 star lower rent beat instead of the gourmet establishments.When a string of food poisonings hit the area Larry is asked by the mayor to investigate, especially with an Iron Chef style cookoff coming up, none of the major establishments are above suspiction of tamering with the competition.  Along the way we see moonpies, a mouthy mom to Larry's sweetie, a horrifying unibrow girl, fart jokes (yes but hey for foodpoisoning you should expect it) and yes Donnie.  The creators must have realized that Larry is no actor and while he doens't do a bad job (he's basically playing himself) he has an excellent supporting cast to help him out especially Tom Wilson, Joe Pantoliano among others to surround Larry and help cover up any jitters.THe movie runs a little short but it's enough to get the story across and not overstay it's welcome.  I may be a Larry fan but I wouldn't listen to him for two hours straight.  The film thankfully follows the logic of Airplane! in that if you have enough jokes a minute even if many are bound to fail, many are bound to work too.  Thankfully thats the case here and if you like Larry then you will love the movie.  If you get a bug up your butt about the jokes in the movie, then don't take it seriously cause not even the movie takes itself that seriously.If I was some uppity snob of a movie critic ready to just write this off and reccamend some Ben Stiller POS, I would have said something along the lines of: ""Larry the Cable Guy Health Inspector, is a movie for ugly people by ugly people in which the protaganist the dreary redneck buffoon played by Dan Whitney stumbles through town on a cookie cutter story and managing to upset or offend the sensibilities of anyone unfortuneate enough to meet him.  The movie is for anyone who thinks farts are still funny cause thats all the humor you will find here.  If you want funny, then see Clerks II.  In these days of political correctness, Larry the Cable Guy should be arrested by the thought police since the things he actually says are a capital offence.""Yeah, well guess what, if you read that review that probably exists somewhere and agreed with it, and you STILL saw Larry the Cable Guy's movie, you should have seen what was coming 10 minutes ago and not even bothered seeing it and deserved what ever you got for seeing it.  Grow up and cut out the ""I'm offended"" baloney.ANYWAY like I was saying it's not a classic since it could've used a little more meat on the bones as far as a story goes.  I thought Tom Wilson was great too even though all he does here is basically yell at Larry.  Wish he could have done more.  Maybe for the sequel.git r done!!",4,Dagum!

He crossed over to acting. Larry isn't a bad actor and this film has it's moments of funny stuff, but overall...This isn't really Larry. The script isn't written by Larry, some of the stuff is probably improvised; But, the film suffers from a lame and cliched script. With the plot of the script (and since the film is a comedy), I knew there was going to be plenty of roaches and over-the-top reasons for Larry shutting down restaurants and such. But the film does one thing that so many comedies before it has done wrong...It relies to much on jokes about flatulence rather than genuine humor. Larry plays (of course) Larry, a slobbish health inspector who is pretty good at what he does. His boss doesn't like him though so he assigns Larry a partner. The partner is a straight-laced by the book woman named Amy Butlin (Iris Bahr). One of the movie's running jokes is that Larry is under the impression Butlin is a guy. Anyway, after there are a series of ""mishaps"" at various 5-star restaurants Larry and Butlin begin to investigate. Along the way, they get to know the seedy mayor M.T. Gunn (Joe Pantoliano, who's got some crazy eyebrow thing going on) and Larry gets a love interest in the form of Jane Whitley (Megyn Price of ""Grounded for Life"" fame). The movie uses every sick sight gag it can think of to gross you out (after seeing a little film called Pink Flamingos, most gross stuff that happens on screen doesn't affect me anymore). The opening scene (and several later scenes) feature shots of Larry's [...]-crack. The film's strong-point are Larry's one-liners, which I assume are improved. ""She's so ugly, she could go trick-or-treating over the telephone"" and his trademark ""Git R Done"" (which he only uses once in the film, I think) are examples of funny stuff. Anyway, this movie IS NOT hilariously funny...You get a few chuckles here and there, but I guess it's what one would expect from Larry the Cable Guy's film debut. You have to expect disgusting things coming from Larry; I mean, it's just like if Ron White was in a movie you'd expect him to play an alcoholic. Anyway, hardcore fans of Larry will love this movie; As will most teenage kids.GRADE: B-",4,"Should've Been Better, But if You're a fan of Larry...",1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2290,"['feature', 'film', 'debut', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'what', 'stand', 'up', 'comedians', 'who', 'make', 'big', 'inevitably', 'do', 'crossed', 'acting', 'Larry', ""n't"", 'bad', 'actor', 'film', 'moments', 'funny', 'stuff', 'overall', ""n't"", 'really', 'Larry', 'script', ""n't"", 'written', 'Larry', 'stuff', 'probably', 'improvised', 'film', 'suffers', 'lame', 'cliched', 'script', 'plot', 'script', 'film', 'comedy', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'plenty', 'roaches', 'over-the-top', 'reasons', 'Larry', 'shutting', 'down', 'restaurants', 'such', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'so', 'many', 'comedies', 'done', 'wrong', 'much', 'jokes', 'flatulence', 'rather', 'genuine', 'humor', 'Larry', 'course', 'Larry', 'slobbish', 'health', 'inspector', 'who', 'pretty', 'good', 'what', 'boss', ""n't"", 'like', 'though', 'so', 'Larry', 'partner', 'partner', 'straight-laced', 'book', 'woman', 'named', 'Amy', 'Butlin', 'Iris', 'Bahr', 'One', 'movie', 'running', 'jokes', 'Larry', 'impression', 'Butlin', 'guy', 'Anyway', 'are', 'series', 'mishaps', 'various', '5-star', 'restaurants', 'Larry', 'Butlin', 'begin', 'investigate', 'way', 'get', 'know', 'seedy', 'mayor', 'M.T', 'Gunn', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'who', 'got', 'crazy', 'eyebrow', 'thing', 'going', 'Larry', 'love', 'interest', 'form', 'Jane', 'Whitley', 'Megyn', 'Price', 'Grounded', 'Life', 'fame', 'movie', 'sick', 'sight', 'gag', 'can', 'think', 'gross', 'out', 'seeing', 'little', 'film', 'called', 'Pink', 'Flamingos', 'most', 'gross', 'stuff', 'screen', ""n't"", 'affect', 'anymore', 'opening', 'scene', 'several', 'later', 'scenes', 'feature', 'shots', 'Larry', '[', ']', '-crack', 'film', 'strong-point', 'are', 'Larry', 'one-liners', 'assume', 'are', 'improved', 'so', 'ugly', 'could', 'go', 'trick-or-treating', 'telephone', 'trademark', 'Git', 'R', 'Done', 'only', 'once', 'film', 'think', 'are', 'examples', 'funny', 'stuff', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'NOT', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'get', 'few', 'chuckles', 'here', 'there', 'guess', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'film', 'debut', 'have', 'expect', 'disgusting', 'things', 'coming', 'Larry', 'mean', 'just', 'Ron', 'White', 'was', 'movie', ""'d"", 'expect', 'play', 'alcoholic', 'Anyway', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'Larry', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'As', 'will', 'most', 'teenage', 'kids.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A
