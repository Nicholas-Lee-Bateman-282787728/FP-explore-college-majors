Beeman,"[1, 2]","The romantic leads are beautiful and fun and the first 50 minutes make you believe that this Bollywood comedy is going to do something very difficult - make an engaging romantic comedy about suicide.  However, as the film moves out of New York City and towards Las Vegas, it also becomes very paint by numbers.  Normally that wouldn't be a problem for a Bollywood film, but since the film embraces strange stereotypes about Americans, it getting quite grating.I called the film edgy because it is one of the few Bollywood films to deal semi-realistically with drinking, homosexuality, and pre-marital sex.  That won't make any impression on an American audience, but conservative Indians are likely to be quite shocked.You will laugh and have a great time until the intermission, but you should walk out after that point.",3,Edgy Bollywood Comedy Pleases but Doesn't Impress,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,821,"['romantic', 'leads', 'are', 'beautiful', 'fun', 'first', '50', 'minutes', 'make', 'believe', 'Bollywood', 'comedy', 'going', 'do', 'something', 'very', 'difficult', 'make', 'engaging', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'suicide', 'However', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'towards', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'also', 'very', 'paint', 'numbers', 'Normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'film', 'strange', 'stereotypes', 'Americans', 'getting', 'quite', 'grating.I', 'called', 'film', 'edgy', 'one', 'few', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'deal', 'semi-realistically', 'drinking', 'homosexuality', 'pre-marital', 'sex', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'impression', 'American', 'audience', 'conservative', 'Indians', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'quite', 'shocked.You', 'will', 'laugh', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'intermission', 'should', 'walk', 'out', 'point']",N/A

Teslovich,"[0, 1]","It seems as if the majority of movies that have come out of Bollywood this past decade are escape romantic comedies that are as predictable as the Sun rising and the rain falling. So, seen in that context this film lived up to it's genre and delivered the inevitable romantic conflict, denouement and resolution leaving us all satisfied and Indian human behavior shown to be, inevitably, at it's finest. Perhaps in all societies it is through media (film, literature, storytelling) that the people with the least resources and hope can live out that vicarious dream. Or, perhaps that media is just another form of entrapment.As far as the movie, the scenes chosen in America for our romantic couple may be known through out the world but are probably stereotypically poor representations. I would have shown more rural and small town/city America and perhaps the parks of Arizona, Utah and Montana for the outside world to journey along with our romantic dual as they discover themselves.The props from furniture to the car seemed too out of touch unless the film was suppose to have taken place in the '80s. As far as music, Bollywood lately is more westernized, to no one's surprise, so there is little to be critical from that perspective except that the creative quality of the lyrics and of the dance routines seemed dated - too simplistic, almost as if they too were choreographed in the '80s.",4,What one would expect.,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",2011,1399,"['majority', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'Bollywood', 'past', 'decade', 'are', 'escape', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'as', 'predictable', 'Sun', 'rising', 'rain', 'falling', 'So', 'seen', 'context', 'film', 'lived', 'up', 'genre', 'delivered', 'inevitable', 'romantic', 'conflict', 'denouement', 'resolution', 'leaving', 'satisfied', 'Indian', 'human', 'behavior', 'shown', 'be', 'inevitably', 'finest', 'Perhaps', 'societies', 'media', 'film', 'literature', 'storytelling', 'people', 'least', 'resources', 'hope', 'can', 'live', 'out', 'vicarious', 'dream', 'perhaps', 'media', 'just', 'form', 'entrapment.As', 'far', 'movie', 'scenes', 'chosen', 'America', 'romantic', 'couple', 'may', 'be', 'known', 'world', 'are', 'probably', 'stereotypically', 'poor', 'representations', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'more', 'rural', 'small', 'town/city', 'America', 'perhaps', 'parks', 'Arizona', 'Utah', 'Montana', 'outside', 'world', 'journey', 'romantic', 'dual', 'discover', 'themselves.The', 'props', 'furniture', 'car', 'seemed', 'too', 'touch', 'film', 'was', 'suppose', 'have', 'taken', 'place', ""'80s"", 'As', 'far', 'music', 'Bollywood', 'lately', 'more', 'westernized', 'one', 'surprise', 'little', 'be', 'critical', 'perspective', 'creative', 'quality', 'lyrics', 'dance', 'routines', 'seemed', 'dated', 'too', 'simplistic', 'almost', 'too', 'were', 'choreographed', ""'80s""]",N/A

(With closed captions in English.) Two would-be suicides meet on the Washington bridge in New York City where their hastily laid plans go awry: hers because of a failed love affair, and his because of the recent stock market crash. After numerous failed attempts, they grant themselves twenty days to do their own version of a Bucket List before their final exit on New Year's Eve.This combines a coast-to-coast road trip from New York to San Francisco in a red Ford Falcon convertible, with delightfully absurd Bollywood-type production numbers in New York, Las Vegas and various points in between.I enjoyed:* Priyanka Chopra (""Dostana"" and dozens of other films in the past nine years) who joins ranks with Ashwarya Rai and Freida Pinto as yet another gorgeous Bollywood actress.* Ranbir Kapoor (""Raajneeti"") who, BTW, does some of his finest work with his shirt off...smile... Fourth-generation Bollywood royality, this hard-working professional is also a director.There is great humor, a chaste love story (they hardly even KISS in Bollywood films!), and a sweet, funny (non) love affair. It's gaudy, light-hearted and just a tad worldly.

1388671,AW7P8LRCFHFSG,B0047KP5A4,Z.B,"[0, 1]","With ANJAANA ANJAANI, director Siddharth Anand accepts a big challenge. This one's a love story, but it doesn't follow the beaten path. It doesn't follow the rules laid out by the romantics in Bollywood. And that's where its strength lies. Generally, couples in love commit to die for each other, but in this film, romance blossoms much, much after the two meet at the bridge for the first time, when they are about to commit suicide. From strangers to lovers to strangers again is how the film explores the relationship between this couple.ANJAANA ANJAANI works for two major reasons. The first being the powerhouse performances by its lead pair. Having watched their careers from the very onset, I would like to state that the two actors deliver career-best performances in ANJAANA ANJAANI. The second reason why ANJAANA ANJAANI works is due to the terrific moments in its second hour.Final word? ANJAANA ANJAANI is worth a watch. If you are a romantic, or even if you are not, ANJAANA ANJAANI is a must-see for its interpretation of modern-day romance.
