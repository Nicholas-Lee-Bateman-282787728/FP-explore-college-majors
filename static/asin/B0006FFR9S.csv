It was an obscure feature with Mickey Rooney that was not a musical. I always liked it because it was full of great driving sequences featuring vintage racing vehicles. No way anyone could mistake Mickey Rooney for Tom Cruise, but the movie is short and had pretty decent acting by Rooney and Mitchell. The black and white DVD transfer is pretty good too.

Of course, as a 500 fan I'd seen parts of it before, but it was lots of fun to watch this one from start to finish.This one features plenty of real race footage from the Indy 500 and the racing storyline is not nearly so contrived as other Hollywood offerings from more recent years that feature better special effects.",4,"Surprisingly good, a must for Indy 500 fans",1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,391,"['big', 'fan', 'Indy', '500', 'just', 'had', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'one', 'course', '500', 'fan', ""'d"", 'seen', 'parts', 'was', 'lots', 'fun', 'watch', 'one', 'start', 'finish.This', 'one', 'plenty', 'real', 'race', 'footage', 'Indy', '500', 'racing', 'storyline', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'contrived', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'offerings', 'more', 'recent', 'years', 'feature', 'better', 'special', 'effects']",N/A

And for decades when you said ""The Race"" anywhere in central Indiana there was no question what race you meant. There was no ""400"", no ""Grand Prix"", no motorcycles, no whatever else is running on that track now. There were open wheel cars, roaring down the straightaways, sliding through the chutes, pushed by their unharnessed and barely helmeted drivers to their mechanical limits and sometimes beyond, risking everything  to claim the right to say ""I won the Indianapolis 500!"". Sure, it's not the greatest movie ever made, but it is a nice little B&W tip of the hat to ""The Race"" and the passion the drivers once took to that fabled track. The race footage filmed at the track is evocative of what ""The Race"" was before technology tamed it. The story isn't much: young man wants to race to prove to himself and to his late father, who was killed in an earlier 500, that he is worthy of his name. (No, I'm not going to tell you whether or not he wins.)

I bought this movie to watch with my 83 year old mother who loves old movies.  My fear was that the movie though good in it's time, would not relate to today's standards of high drama.  I'll have to admit that the plot was simple, yet enjoyable as a typical Mickey Rooney flic.  But what was most fascinating to me was the excellent historical footage of Indy car races during the 1940's.  If you think that race car drivers are courageous heroes today, watch this movie.  I am a race car fan of all types and can not believe the lack of saftey features during that time.  Forget about fire retardant driving suits with gloves etc.  These guys wore short sleeve everyday shirts and no gloves.  I'm surprised they wore helmets but nothing like todays head gear.  What struck me the most was the fact that seatbelts were not even worn.  Historical footage of early Indy 500 races showed drivers regularly being thrown out of burning cars.  Any car that was headed for the wall either went over it or through it.  I wonder how many men died at an average Indy type car race in that era. Footage of spectacular firey crashes were abundant in this film.  Even if you are not a Mickey Rooney fan or don't even like old movies, you owe it to yourself to see this film for it's historical content if you are a car racing fan.",4,Great for Mickey Rooney and Race Car Fans,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,1487,"['saw', 'Big', 'Wheel', 'kid', 'remembered', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'good', 'simple', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'movie', 'vintage', 'car', 'racing', 'bought', 'movie', 'watch', '83', 'year', 'old', 'mother', 'who', 'old', 'movies', 'fear', 'was', 'movie', 'good', 'time', 'would', 'not', 'relate', 'today', 'standards', 'high', 'drama', ""'ll"", 'have', 'admit', 'plot', 'was', 'simple', 'yet', 'enjoyable', 'typical', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'flic', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'fascinating', 'was', 'excellent', 'historical', 'footage', 'Indy', 'car', 'races', '1940', 'think', 'race', 'car', 'drivers', 'are', 'courageous', 'heroes', 'today', 'watch', 'movie', 'am', 'race', 'car', 'fan', 'types', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'lack', 'saftey', 'features', 'time', 'Forget', 'fire', 'retardant', 'driving', 'suits', 'gloves', 'etc', 'guys', 'wore', 'short', 'sleeve', 'everyday', 'shirts', 'gloves', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'wore', 'helmets', 'nothing', 'todays', 'head', 'gear', 'What', 'struck', 'most', 'was', 'fact', 'seatbelts', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'worn', 'Historical', 'footage', 'early', 'Indy', '500', 'races', 'showed', 'drivers', 'regularly', 'being', 'thrown', 'burning', 'cars', 'car', 'was', 'headed', 'wall', 'went', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'men', 'died', 'average', 'Indy', 'type', 'car', 'race', 'era', 'Footage', 'spectacular', 'firey', 'crashes', 'were', 'abundant', 'film', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'old', 'movies', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'film', 'historical', 'content', 'are', 'car', 'racing', 'fan']",N/A
