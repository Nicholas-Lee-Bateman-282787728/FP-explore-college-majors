871131,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006N2DSI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 14]","After the birth of Fahrenheit 9/11 and other Michael Moore creations, there has been a plethora of politically driven documentaries entering the media culture.  More and more films are being created to showcase either the ingenuity of the activists, or to uncover some unknown corruption in the system that we were not familiar with.  It is a chance to be educated about the world surrounding us and the honesty of evil. In one of the most recent documentary releases, The Yes Men, we have the opportunity to both see the ingenuity of the activists and slightly uncover some corruption in the world.  While The Yes Men is a very active film giving us these nervous moments of tension as two men pretend to be someone that they are not, the words and final moments that they are trying to convey do not always seem to come full circle.  It felt as if they had this huge ""ta-da"" at the end of their crafty moment, but nobody seemed to care.  Everyone agreed and went about their normal business.  I guess that was the point that these activists were trying to show, but somehow I felt like it was all a part of some lackluster performance instead of this ""in-your-face, this is wrong with our country"" moment.Our two main characters that we follow throughout the course of the film, Mike Bonanno and Dr. Andreas Bichlbauer (as if these are their real names), seem like they have such a grasp on their knowledge of the issues that they would want a bigger change to happen at the end of their ""moment of glory"" instead of just walking away as if they were just another cog in the machine.  For example, their first speech overseas about the WTO and this phallic device that will help supervisors maintain their workers was a punch in the face, but like my reaction to the situation, nobody seemed to care.  I think, in this case, it hurt the film.  I wanted feedback from the audience about this bold move by the WTO and see outrage in their eyes, but instead nobody seemed to care.  The same can be said about the last conference they attend where they officially close the WTO.  That is a huge statement, and yet again ... nobody seemed to care.  Sure, there were people afterwards talking about how happy they were, but the excitement or emotion was just not present.  I wanted, and honestly needed, something that showed that these activists were making riffs in the corporate eyes of the world, not just filling a time slot.The only time that they did not get such a passive response was when they spoke during a college class about the food solution in third world countries.  Here, we did see the emotion and the anger at what they suggested, albeit was a bit more graphic and disturbing, but there was an outburst at the idea.  The only trouble is that I have been to conferences before, and most of the time you are there because your business has forced you to be there, so you will believe anything that is said until the day is over just to get through.  In college, you pay for your schooling so independent thought really is encouraged and is shown in this film.  I do not think that this college scene did the justice that it deserved and really didn't seem to mesh with the rest of the film.  I think these guys wanted to get some raw emotion reactions from anyone, and they found it here.  I think they were trying to overcompensate for what their other conferences were missing.  Sadly, it felt more like a jumbled mess instead of a valued point.Overall, I was somewhat impressed with some of the aspects of this film, while not impressed with others.  I thought the fact that these two ""nobodys"" could get into these conferences without a lick of creditation or background check.  Especially after the world's security tightened after 9/11.  I think that was the aspect that shocked me the most.  The rest of the film was interesting to watch, it just never felt like it was edited together correctly or that there was this big ""ooooohhhhhh......ahhhhhhhhh"" sort of moments.  Like the audiences at the conferences, I sat back and watched without really seeing the outcome of their work.  I would have liked to know more about these guys and the changes they made to our global community.  I would have liked to see at least one curmudgedy old man getting angry about what these two radicals thought, but nothing.  Just plain agreement and wipe the slate clean.  I felt the Yes Men focused to deeply on the development of each situation without having any sort of strong follow-up with the results.  That hurt this film deeply.  Perhaps I have grown accustomed to the ""shock-umentary"" style of filmmaking that is being released more and more, but I just never felt passionate about these guys.  They were doing good work, but will it be remembered for years to come?  I am not 100% sold on it yet.Grade: *** out of *****",3,The stupidity of corporations revealed...,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,4835,"['birth', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'other', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'creations', 'been', 'plethora', 'politically', 'driven', 'documentaries', 'entering', 'media', 'culture', 'More', 'more', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'created', 'showcase', 'either', 'ingenuity', 'activists', 'uncover', 'unknown', 'corruption', 'system', 'were', 'not', 'familiar', 'chance', 'be', 'educated', 'world', 'surrounding', 'honesty', 'evil', 'one', 'most', 'recent', 'documentary', 'releases', 'Yes', 'Men', 'have', 'opportunity', 'see', 'ingenuity', 'activists', 'slightly', 'uncover', 'corruption', 'world', 'Yes', 'Men', 'very', 'active', 'film', 'giving', 'nervous', 'moments', 'tension', 'two', 'men', 'pretend', 'be', 'someone', 'are', 'not', 'words', 'final', 'moments', 'are', 'trying', 'convey', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'seem', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'felt', 'had', 'huge', 'ta-da', 'end', 'crafty', 'moment', 'nobody', 'seemed', 'care', 'Everyone', 'agreed', 'went', 'normal', 'business', 'guess', 'was', 'point', 'activists', 'were', 'trying', 'show', 'somehow', 'felt', 'was', 'part', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'instead', 'in-your-face', 'wrong', 'country', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'follow', 'course', 'film', 'Mike', 'Bonanno', 'Dr.', 'Andreas', 'Bichlbauer', 'are', 'real', 'names', 'seem', 'have', 'grasp', 'knowledge', 'issues', 'would', 'want', 'bigger', 'change', 'happen', 'end', 'moment', 'glory', 'instead', 'just', 'walking', 'away', 'were', 'just', 'cog', 'machine', 'example', 'first', 'speech', 'overseas', 'WTO', 'phallic', 'device', 'will', 'help', 'supervisors', 'maintain', 'workers', 'was', 'punch', 'face', 'reaction', 'situation', 'nobody', 'seemed', 'care', 'think', 'case', 'hurt', 'film', 'wanted', 'feedback', 'audience', 'bold', 'move', 'WTO', 'see', 'outrage', 'eyes', 'instead', 'nobody', 'seemed', 'care', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'last', 'conference', 'attend', 'where', 'officially', 'close', 'WTO', 'huge', 'statement', 'yet', 'again', 'nobody', 'seemed', 'care', 'Sure', 'were', 'people', 'afterwards', 'talking', 'how', 'happy', 'were', 'excitement', 'emotion', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'present', 'wanted', 'honestly', 'needed', 'something', 'showed', 'activists', 'were', 'making', 'riffs', 'corporate', 'eyes', 'world', 'not', 'just', 'filling', 'time', 'only', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'such', 'passive', 'response', 'was', 'when', 'spoke', 'college', 'class', 'food', 'solution', 'third', 'world', 'countries', 'Here', 'did', 'see', 'emotion', 'anger', 'what', 'suggested', 'albeit', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'was', 'outburst', 'idea', 'only', 'trouble', 'have', 'been', 'conferences', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'there', 'business', 'forced', 'be', 'there', 'will', 'believe', 'anything', 'said', 'day', 'over', 'just', 'get', 'college', 'pay', 'schooling', 'so', 'independent', 'thought', 'really', 'encouraged', 'shown', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'college', 'scene', 'did', 'justice', 'deserved', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mesh', 'rest', 'film', 'think', 'guys', 'wanted', 'get', 'raw', 'emotion', 'reactions', 'anyone', 'found', 'here', 'think', 'were', 'trying', 'overcompensate', 'what', 'other', 'conferences', 'were', 'missing', 'Sadly', 'felt', 'more', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'instead', 'valued', 'point.Overall', 'was', 'somewhat', 'impressed', 'aspects', 'film', 'not', 'impressed', 'others', 'thought', 'fact', 'two', 'nobodys', 'could', 'get', 'conferences', 'lick', 'creditation', 'background', 'check', 'Especially', 'world', 'security', 'tightened', '9/11', 'think', 'was', 'aspect', 'shocked', 'most', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'watch', 'just', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'edited', 'together', 'correctly', 'was', 'big', 'ooooohhhhhh', 'ahhhhhhhhh', 'sort', 'moments', 'audiences', 'conferences', 'sat', 'back', 'watched', 'really', 'seeing', 'outcome', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'know', 'more', 'guys', 'changes', 'made', 'global', 'community', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'least', 'one', 'curmudgedy', 'old', 'man', 'getting', 'angry', 'what', 'two', 'radicals', 'thought', 'nothing', 'Just', 'plain', 'agreement', 'wipe', 'slate', 'clean', 'felt', 'Yes', 'Men', 'focused', 'deeply', 'development', 'situation', 'having', 'sort', 'strong', 'follow-up', 'results', 'hurt', 'film', 'deeply', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'shock-umentary', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'being', 'released', 'more', 'more', 'just', 'never', 'felt', 'passionate', 'guys', 'were', 'doing', 'good', 'work', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'years', 'come', 'am', 'not', '100', '%', 'sold', '***', '*****']",N/A

So, it's a low-budget documentary and cannot be expected to run as smoothly as a more polished operation.The Yes Men started when a group of rather creative progressives were offered a free web domain name, gwbush.com, in 1999. The real Bush campaign was at georgewbush.org, or perhaps .com, so people would get the satire one by accident. They made it look as much like the real thing as possible, and got some good publicity off the effort. But, of course, Bush was elected anyway. Then they were offered another to use to satirize the World Trade Organization, and a funny thing happened. They started getting responses that apparently believed it was the real WTO web site. And invitations to various conferences and things.They accepted the invitations. Their first guerrilla theater project was at a conference on textiles, and I won't spoil the fun by telling you what they did. Amazing how many people took it seriously, though. Then they got an invitation to a conference on agriculture in Australia, and started working up a rather brilliant project for that. Just before they were to take it to a college in upstate New York for a try-out, the Australian conference was canceled for having too few participants register. Suddenly the classroom full of economics majors was the real thing for this presentation.It was brilliant. But so were the students, and after awhile they realized they were being spoofed. That was what the Yes Men had expected at the textile conference, but apparently marketing professionals don't pay as much attention (or are not as smart?) as students.Finally, the Australian promoter worked hard to find a smaller venue where their presentation could be made (remember, she's thinking she's talking to the WTO), and they did the best performance they could: they disbanded the WTO.Michael Miller appears a few times, and manages to explain what's happening better than the Yes Men do. But then he's been at this a long, long time.

871133,A2HL7R8R23NERT,B0006N2DSI,Bart King,"[6, 9]","Let me be brief: The best way to appreciate the Yes Men is through the media coverage of their stunts. This film, which gives the ""backstory"" on the planning of these media events, is vastly less interesting than the stunts themselves.Don't get me wrong; these guys have moxie and brio to spare, and there are entertaining moments. It is pretty funny (and frightening) to see stone-faced WTO folk listen to the outrageous speeches (endorsing slavery and so forth) that Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonnano concoct with nary a reaction.But the Yes Men do a surprisingly poor job of articulating their political stance. They are against the WTO. Fair enough; how come? The best explanation of WHY someone should oppose WTO policies comes from a Brit  who the Yes Men snookered on the European version of CNBC.So although I agree with their point-of-view, I'm not going to give this movie a 5-star review that isn't warranted. In other words, I'm not going to be a Yes Man.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","You might often hear the phrase ""You've got to see this to believe it,"" and although I'm going to risk sounding like a clich&eacute;, you need to see this documentary to believe it.It isn't that THE YES MEN is some spectacularly put together documentary that'll blow your mind. It isn't. It's not filmed particularly well, and needed some help in the editing department (lingering on guys working on their computers is about as entertaining as watching paint dry).But the subject matter and the response by supposed ""professionals"" in the business world were so striking as to be baffling. Let me explain.This is the story of two geeks named Mike Bonanno and Andy Bichlbaum, The Yes Men. They are antiglobalization activists who've gone extreme in order to get their views across.Initially they set up a website that mirrored George W. Bush's, including placing some rather rude (if not true) commentary about our current Prez on the site. After having enough fun there, the two whizzes set their sights on The World Trade Organization, and put up a mirror site of it, too. But this time they went a bit further. Occasionally businesses from around the world would mistake their fake WTO website for the real one and would send our two pranksters invitations to meet and talk about WTO matters. This included a segment on CNN and then, later, to European countries where they set up outlandish topic discussions (including a huge phallic device used to monitor employees -- employees who were somehow connected via slavery by Mike and Andy -- and to stimulate certain gluteal muscle groups when things went right or wrong). What was astonishing was the acceptance of this device by the European country in question (sure, they all laughed when they saw it, but they didn't completely dismiss it either!).Our two WTO phonies finally get the response they wanted after visiting a college campus posing as WTO officials and sporting the idea of recycling human waste into poop-patties in order to help feed starving third world populations. FINALLY the college folks understood the mockery and threw things at Mike and Andy.It is a bit disturbing, however, that someone could pull-off such an incredible hoax. The ending, too, is astonishing; our two boys go to Australia and state that the WTO is shutting down and will be reinventing itself in a more humane fashion. This was picked up by numerous news agencies and sent around the media globe!Although interesting, disturbing, and flat-out hysterically funny in many portions, the documentary does lag when it shows our two main guys sleeping, playing with their computers, or other items that really bogged the story down and nearly brought it to a halt.

871135,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B0006N2DSI,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[19, 24]","Mike Bonanno and Andy Bichlbaum star in this documentary as the ""Yes Men""- two political activists who impersonate members of the World Trade Organization and proceed to go on television news shows and present lectures to audiences of intellectuals and students about this organization. They get the idea after setting up a web site that is very similar to the actual WTO web site. So similar is the site, in fact, that the two men start to get speaking engagement offers from official organizations who mistake them for actual WTO members.Mike and Andy decide this is a great opportunity to expose the WTO and all its economic wrongs. They go to these speaking halls and make television appearances where they continue to pretend they are WTO spokesmen, while satirically attacking the group they represent by telling, point blank, what this organization is all about in their eyes: A group that exploits poorer nations for the benefit of wealthier countries. They score a couple of hits in their efforts, but most of their success comes in the humor department. When it comes to educational value, this documentary misses the mark. And that is a real shame because a documentary such as this one would have presented an excellent opportunity to explain the many wrongs of the WTO.Instead of presenting the cold, hard facts about the WTO and why it is supposedly so bad for the world economy, this documentary focuses too much on being funny and in doing so, it loses some credibility. As far as the humor goes, there are some funny moments, particularly the scene where one of the ""Yes Men"" is on a news program with other men giving his take on world economic policy. Another funny moment comes when the two guys are presenting the WTO agenda to exploit the underprivileged of the world to a group of students who grow more and more impatient with them with each passing minute. These scenes offer some humorous value, I will admit that. But there isn't enough educational material to explain why the WTO is apparently so evil. You get the impression that these are just a couple of pranksters who aren't really all that serious about their disliking of the WTO. They seem more interested in being funny than in educating the viewer.Some of the logic is twisted and flawed in this documentary, too, and the guys jump too quickly to the worst conclusions in order to support their own views. For example, there is one scene where they give a presentation to a group of economic intellectuals and they talk about ways to control workers. When they are finished and ask for questions, no one has any and they receive applause when they leave. When they reflect back on this, they conclude that this reaction (or lack thereof) means the group of people was in full agreement with what they talked about.

Andy and Mike are definitely not for globalization and free trade. The whole joke begins when The Yes Men creates a website that basically looks like the WTO's website, not thinking that they would be taken remotely seriously. What happens from there all snowballs and quickly becomes a long-running Punk'd segment. It is non-stop laughs when Andy and Dick lectures at a university on the idea of recycling food in third world countries. That was probably my most personal favorite segment of the film. The college students' reactions were absolutely funny. The first segment where the pair travels to Europe and Andy dons on a gold suit with a huge phallus-looking device was equally funny.

The basic idea is excellent. As large organizations have a far easier time shaping public opinion than two ordinary guys, Andy and Mike decide to turn this ability against them.First, they create a fake WTO website under gatt.org where they present what the WTO does as they see it. Search engines probably direct some wayward surfers their way, but it is mostly professional journalists and event planners who get tricked and bring these two pranksters into the mainstream media. As representatives of the WTO, they receive invitations to debate, for example, an anti-globalization activist on CNN, give a public lecture for a business conference in Tampere, Finland, a mock lecture for college students, and a serious one for journalists and reserachers interested in international trade in Australia. The documentary traces the preparation and delivery of their pranks.The highlights of Yes Men are the pranks themselves. The documentary is edited without much imagination, we abruptly move from one prank to the next without getting much insight into the activists' motivation, thoughts and feelings.The pranks are imaginative, if sometimes a little juvenile, and are based on the idea that if you take ideas couched in polite, professional lingo and take them to their logical extreme, people will notice their absurdity. The viewer's fun arises from being initiated and watching others' reactions from a position of knowledge (kind of like Candid Camera). The silent tragedy of Yes Men is that the constraints of professional journalism and business organizations are such that even completely outrageous ideas receive a polite reception, more a bow to the title of the presenter as a WTO representative than to the power of his ideas. Only college students are shown to be brave or innocent enough to point out that the king has no clothes.Ultimately, Mike and Andy fail in shaking up public opinion. No enormous scandal arises, police doesn't lead them away in handcuffs. Perhaps they fail because we don't listen attentively and don't care all that much. I was wondering throughout whether I would have noticed that something was amiss if I saw the broadcast or the lecture.

I could be wrong, but I haven't heard anything about the WTO recycling bodily wastes into MacDonalds burgers. There's a good reason for this: they aren't. At least not yet.When executed correctly, satire can be the most compelling form of persuasion, but the Yes Men always seem either too reserved or too full of their own opinions to make it work.It doesn't exactly strengthen your case when you compare yourselves to identity thefts, nor does it discredit the WTO when you go on MSNBC and start winning debates for them. I was also bothered that these self-proclaimed warriors for the Third World aren't exactly bright. ""There's a time change in Paris?"" ""Maybe it IS more fun to be satirical than serious."" These guys aren't exactly modern Alexander Popes. The only thing that keeps this film on its feet is the fact that no one else got the joke. But consider this: If an British speaker came here and compared Oliver Cromwell and George W. Bush, would you get it? Why should a French audience then be expected to be offended by a comparison between the WTO and the Civil War?I'm a big fan of the type of humor the Yes Men were trying to do. I'm a huge fan Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, in which a liberal comedian goes on air posing as an ultra-conservative pundit to tear down right wing platform from the inside. The Yes Men, on the other hand, are never brutally frank enough to bring it out. Instead they hide behind the same dry corporate presentations that established WTO in the first place. There was a great documentary to be made here, but this isn't it.One more thing, at the end of the film they fake the dismantling of the WTO, then act as if their work is done and the WTO has really disbanded.

I'm not sure it comes across that way.The 'Yes Men' have imitation websites of large organisations like the WTO (world trade organisation) and are sometimes mistaken for the real things; hence, they get invited to give speeches and the like. That's a great idea. When they give these speeches, or lectures, they say some absurd things to make the World Trade Organisation look bad. People don't recognise it's the Yes Men. I'm fine with all that, loved it, but some of their ideas are way off mark.I don't see the point to give a lecture in Finland wearing a golden jump-suit with a giant genital protruding out of it. Sure it gives a laugh, but when they say that these were the most intelligent and educated people in the world yet they didn't even ask any questions, it's not because they don't really care, but they probably saw you guys coming a mile off.They then went off to give a lecture to like-minded uni students in New York and got the reaction they wanted... something absurd about giving poo to people in third world countries. I didn't understand that bit at the end when they said the WTO was disbanding... sure a few of the journalists were a bit moved or shocked, but that was it.There were too many 'behind the scenes' shots of them talking about being hungry and feeling tired, but the idea was good, really good, and they were brave in doing what they did. The most resonating point of the docu-film was the bit at the start about George W Bush talking about 'too much freedom' - really chilling stuff, but I thought they were dragging out Michael Moore to try and give credo to what they were doing.Ultimately, it's a luke-warm experience for me. They could have made it more enjoyable and fun by focusing on the juicy bits, rather than behind the scenes commentary, the amazing platform they created for themselves should have been utilised better.
