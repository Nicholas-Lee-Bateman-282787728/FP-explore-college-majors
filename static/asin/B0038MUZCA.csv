I think there is a third season that hasn't made it to DVD yet, so I'm waiting for that to happen.In the pilot the outbreak happens so fast, that its actually not believable.  Not to mention the poor editing.  But, AFTER the outbreak, it gets MUCH MUCH better!!!!  The characters are extremely well written and the Actors and Actresses do an excellent job in bringing them to development.  The myriad of survivors is interesting in and of itself - a Systems Engineer, a Mom, a Playboy, a Debutante, a Doctor, a School-boy, and a Convict.",5,Another Great Show Cut Short Too Soon,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,633,"['was', 'really', 'great', 'show', 'stumbled', 'accident', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'think', 'third', 'season', ""n't"", 'made', 'DVD', 'yet', ""'m"", 'waiting', 'happen.In', 'pilot', 'outbreak', 'so', 'fast', 'actually', 'not', 'believable', 'Not', 'mention', 'poor', 'editing', 'AFTER', 'outbreak', 'MUCH', 'MUCH', 'better', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'Actors', 'Actresses', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'development', 'myriad', 'survivors', 'interesting', 'Systems', 'Engineer', 'Mom', 'Playboy', 'Debutante', 'Doctor', 'School-boy', 'Convict']",Survivors: Complete Seasons One & Two
1332538,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B0038MUZCA,Allan M. Lees,"[0, 0]","The survivor genre answers our need for a ""simpler life"" in this complex world. As one of the characters in Series One notes, we all live by pressing buttons but we don't understand anything about the fundamentals. We've become infantile - dependent on our technology for the basics of survival. And when that disappears... what's left? The series follows a small group of people who manage to survive a virulent virus that kills 99% of the population. The various characters span the spectrum but all are fairly true to life. None are saints, some are irredeemable. The characterisation is really why you should watch this series: no Hollywood erzatz sentimentality here. And the manner in which the ""government"" re-establishes itself by relying on thugs and forced labor is so painfully true to life that it makes for deeply uncomfortable viewing. And like all neo-fascists everywhere, the UK government minister who sets it all in motion truly believes she is ""saving"" her people - much as Stalin and Mao ""saved"" theirs...Of course, as a TV show, it can't be fully realistic. No one gets blood poisoning from an abscess or a rotten tooth; there are no feral dogs roaming the deserted streets to pick off stragglers. And for some reason the opening titles show bacteria reproducing whereas the conceit of the show is that a virus was responsible for the depopulation of the UK. But these are fairly minor quibbles; as TV goes, this is worth watching.",4,Slice of Life after Mass Death,1324857600,"12 26, 2011",2011,1452,"['survivor', 'genre', 'answers', 'need', 'simpler', 'life', 'complex', 'world', 'one', 'characters', 'Series', 'One', 'live', 'pressing', 'buttons', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'anything', 'fundamentals', ""'ve"", 'become', 'infantile', 'dependent', 'technology', 'basics', 'survival', 'when', 'what', 'left', 'series', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'manage', 'survive', 'virulent', 'virus', '99', '%', 'population', 'various', 'characters', 'span', 'spectrum', 'are', 'fairly', 'true', 'life', 'None', 'are', 'saints', 'are', 'irredeemable', 'characterisation', 'really', 'why', 'should', 'watch', 'series', 'Hollywood', 'erzatz', 'sentimentality', 'here', 'manner', 'government', 're-establishes', 'relying', 'thugs', 'forced', 'labor', 'so', 'painfully', 'true', 'life', 'deeply', 'uncomfortable', 'viewing', 'neo-fascists', 'everywhere', 'UK', 'government', 'minister', 'who', 'motion', 'truly', 'saving', 'people', 'much', 'Stalin', 'Mao', 'saved', 'theirs', 'course', 'TV', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fully', 'realistic', 'one', 'blood', 'poisoning', 'abscess', 'rotten', 'tooth', 'are', 'feral', 'dogs', 'roaming', 'deserted', 'streets', 'pick', 'off', 'stragglers', 'reason', 'opening', 'show', 'bacteria', 'reproducing', 'conceit', 'show', 'virus', 'was', 'responsible', 'depopulation', 'UK', 'are', 'fairly', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'TV', 'worth', 'watching']",Survivors: Complete Seasons One & Two
1332539,A21KM4ZAKY9U9S,B0038MUZCA,Chrome Oxide,"[7, 9]","First off, this is a review of the series I just watched on NetFlix, not the DVD, so I won't comment on features, extras or packaging.  This review is of the 12 episodes in season 1 and 2.I liked the basic end of the world concept.  While it has been done before, there is no reason why it can't be done again.  And again.  I have no problem with the acting, the concept, or the professionalism of the production.What I do have is a problem with is the script and the characters.  Keep in mind that this is the end of the world as they knew it.  The countryside is full of looters, including themselves.As I watched the series, about half way through I started rooting for the ""bad guys"" to kill off the ""good guys.""  Although I thought the remaining survivors would even shrug that off and keep pretending that the world can't be that bad.No matter how many times the ""good guys"" were threatened with violence and guns, they refused to protect themselves.  They were continually rescued by the one ""good guy"" with a violent nature, and then got upset at him for being violent.  Although they never got upset at him rescuing them.  Only that he used violence to rescue them from violent people.No matter how many times the ""good guys"" supplies were stolen, they refused to set guards to prevent the theft.Most of the people they met, including themselves, were incredibly naive.  They seemed to act as if there was nothing wrong and everybody would obey the rules.  Anybody who wasn't naive was a ""bad guy"" and threatened them.  And the ""good guys"" were always surprised when this happened.  This is even after months of roaming the countryside and meeting lots of ""bad guys"".Here is another point I found annoying, more so as the series progressed.  Most of the planet has been decimated by a plague.  Yet every week the ""good guys"" had no problem stumbling into another group of survivors.  Some good, some bad.All in all a disappointing viewing experience.",1,Survivors Deserve To Die A Horrible Death,1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,1959,"['First', 'off', 'review', 'series', 'just', 'watched', 'NetFlix', 'not', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comment', 'features', 'extras', 'packaging', 'review', '12', 'episodes', 'season', '1', '2.I', 'liked', 'basic', 'end', 'world', 'concept', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'reason', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'again', 'again', 'have', 'problem', 'acting', 'concept', 'professionalism', 'production.What', 'do', 'have', 'problem', 'script', 'characters', 'Keep', 'mind', 'end', 'world', 'knew', 'countryside', 'full', 'looters', 'including', 'themselves.As', 'watched', 'series', 'way', 'started', 'rooting', 'bad', 'guys', 'kill', 'off', 'good', 'guys', 'thought', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'would', 'even', 'shrug', 'off', 'keep', 'pretending', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad.No', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'good', 'guys', 'were', 'threatened', 'violence', 'guns', 'refused', 'protect', 'were', 'continually', 'rescued', 'one', 'good', 'guy', 'violent', 'nature', 'then', 'got', 'upset', 'being', 'violent', 'never', 'got', 'upset', 'rescuing', 'Only', 'used', 'violence', 'rescue', 'violent', 'people.No', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'good', 'guys', 'supplies', 'were', 'stolen', 'refused', 'set', 'guards', 'prevent', 'theft.Most', 'people', 'met', 'including', 'were', 'incredibly', 'naive', 'seemed', 'act', 'was', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'everybody', 'would', 'obey', 'rules', 'Anybody', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'naive', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'threatened', 'good', 'guys', 'were', 'always', 'surprised', 'when', 'happened', 'even', 'months', 'roaming', 'countryside', 'meeting', 'lots', 'bad', 'guys', 'point', 'found', 'annoying', 'more', 'so', 'series', 'progressed', 'Most', 'planet', 'been', 'decimated', 'plague', 'week', 'good', 'guys', 'had', 'problem', 'stumbling', 'group', 'survivors', 'good', 'bad.All', 'disappointing', 'viewing', 'experience']",Survivors: Complete Seasons One & Two
1332540,A3R5G3QX630HGH,B0038MUZCA,D. Mattson,"[2, 3]","My sister in Atlanta told me about this series.  It sounded so good that I found the set and bought it! From the first episode (which was terrific), I was hooked!!!  Granted, I did find it odd that the few survivors who meet up with each other don't seem particularly happy to see one another (I mean, wouldn't you be a little excited?).  And, found it odd that there wasn't a more cohesive 'plan' once the group got together (why didn't they ever sit down and make some cohesive decisions as a group about where they wanted to settle, what they planned to do in the future, etc.).  And, once they found other survivors along the way that weren't out to kill each other, why did they just have lunch with them and then say, ""Well, see ya!""?  It seems there would have been more of an effort to say, ""There are so few of us left on this earth, and you have a nice crop of food growing here, and you seem to have room for us, can we stay with you?""  I mean, make a colony already!  But, then I guess there wouldn't have been much of a story.  I did so love this, and loved the characters (even the really evil ones).  Some characters really surprised me.  And, I was NEVER bored!  I was so eager to see Season 3, but then saw on line that there would not be another season.  SO disappointed! It ended with such a cliffhanger and I had so many questions!  Isn't that always the way?  Just when you fall in love with a series (i.e. Defying Gravity, Pushing Daisies, etc.), they go and cancel on you!

1332541,A2HBRINA3F9YHV,B0038MUZCA,Doctor Trance,"[6, 8]","Excellent characters and performances highlight this updated version of the 70's British cult show, Survivors.  Similarities abound between this and the old version, as in some of the exact same characters and plot lines, however there is enough fresh material and new faces to keep fans (like me) of the original entertained.  For me, the highlight of series 1 was episode 4.  Several different storylines and action going on everywhere, all culminating in a very satisfying conclusion.  Keeping up with the rapid pace and action of sci fi shows today, these events would have taken 3 episodes to unfold in the old series.  I also think that nearly all the characters here feature enough mystery to keep you guessing as to how they will act next, which is a more dramatic portrayal over some of the low-key original characters.I was a tad disappointed in how series 2 turned into more of a continually running plot line than some of the more individualized series 1 episodes.  I always like TV seasons better when they feature individual primary stories, than one spread out over a whole season.  Luckily, the performances and gritty portrayal of life and survival after a catastrophic disaster make this season fulfilling nonetheless.Trivia: The original series was created by the late Terry Nation, who was also responsible for Blake's 7 and the Daleks from Dr. Who.",5,Very entertaining British Sci-Fi TV remake,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,1369,"['Excellent', 'characters', 'performances', 'highlight', 'updated', 'version', '70', 'British', 'cult', 'show', 'Survivors', 'Similarities', 'abound', 'old', 'version', 'exact', 'same', 'characters', 'plot', 'lines', 'however', 'enough', 'fresh', 'material', 'new', 'keep', 'fans', 'original', 'entertained', 'highlight', 'series', '1', 'was', 'episode', '4', 'Several', 'different', 'storylines', 'action', 'going', 'everywhere', 'culminating', 'very', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'Keeping', 'up', 'rapid', 'pace', 'action', 'sci', 'fi', 'shows', 'today', 'events', 'would', 'have', 'taken', '3', 'episodes', 'unfold', 'old', 'series', 'also', 'think', 'nearly', 'characters', 'here', 'feature', 'enough', 'mystery', 'keep', 'guessing', 'how', 'will', 'act', 'next', 'more', 'dramatic', 'portrayal', 'low-key', 'original', 'characters.I', 'was', 'tad', 'disappointed', 'how', 'series', '2', 'turned', 'more', 'continually', 'running', 'plot', 'line', 'more', 'individualized', 'series', '1', 'episodes', 'always', 'TV', 'seasons', 'better', 'when', 'feature', 'individual', 'primary', 'stories', 'one', 'spread', 'whole', 'season', 'Luckily', 'performances', 'gritty', 'portrayal', 'life', 'survival', 'catastrophic', 'disaster', 'make', 'season', 'fulfilling', 'nonetheless.Trivia', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'created', 'late', 'Terry', 'Nation', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'Blake', '7', 'Daleks', 'Dr.', 'Who']",Survivors: Complete Seasons One & Two
1332542,A1L510KRPXN8LR,B0038MUZCA,Gerard S. Murphy,"[2, 3]","The first episode is the best.  Everyone dies in a big flu.  The government minister in the form of the Right Honourable Samantha Willis MP, lies about it until it was too late.  So billions die.Each episode that follows is a lesson in how to be politically correct.  The flu originates in China but is called the European flu (perhaps it would be impolite to call it a Chinese flu). The regular cast is introduced. It is diverse according to the proper gender, sexual, ethnic and racial requirements.  Al Sadiq, a Saudi playboy picks up Najid Hanif, a young Muslim boy.  Anya Raczynski, a gay medical doctor who watches too many people die and Tom Price who kills a guard to escape prison when everyone else dies, are introduced.  The main character is Abby Grant, who gets sick but survives.  We also meet nice guy Greg who wants to be alone but is willing to give Abby a ride. In the second episode we meet Sarah, a poor hopeless slut who spreads her legs for a liquer warehouse and later for every guy who is nice to her and a few that are mean to her.  She is played by Robyn Addison who seems to be the best actor on the show - the character is weak and annoying - always the first to tell the other characters that their plans won't work and whining - but she is believable and well played. We also meet Dexter, a small time thug who kills looters and threatens the group.There are three themes that run through the episodes. First, is that guns are scary and good people do not use them. The audience is subject to repeated lectures from everyone about how bad guns are.  Greg won't shoot them because once when his wife left him for another man Greg punched the other man and Greg was ashamed so he concluded that violence never solves anything. Abby is all gung ho to join the new government lead by none other than the Right Honourable Samantha Willis MP - the only surviving member of the government.  This is the second theme: everyone loves government and can't imagine life without it.  When Abby is later kidnapped she tells a sheltered woman, Jill, that everyone is dead and there is no power Jill is surprised but when Abby continues ""there is no government, no services.."" Jill's eyes widen and her lips tremble and she just loses it.  No government! What? That means no health care. Yikes. We had better put the Minister in charge of the government health care in charge of everything and ignore what happened last time she had some responsibility. Abby decides not to join the new government because Willis shoots a looter after a show trial.Dexter later becomes a government enforcer of rules and shoots Greg but instead of blaming Willis's government he blames Tom who once shot a government thug who was kidnapping Anya.  Willis sort of decided to have a socialist utopia - from each according to his ability and to each according to his needs.  She basically enslave all of the people for their ""ability"" and distributes rations based on her determination of ""needs.""  The government higher ups live nicely, the others work hard.  She gives speeches and Dexter enforces the new constitution brutally.The final theme is that anyone who provides a decent service for a profit must have evil motives.  The writers, of course, could not let anyone get away with selling anything honestly.  So Sarah buys what she wants and pays for it by spreading her legs even if she has to take some brutality too.  The guy who sells knicknacks out of his truck enslaves people too.  Abby is kidnaped by a nefarious pharmaceutical company.  The business plan of the corporation seems to be: Step 1. kill everyone on earth Step 2. Make terrific profit by selling the vaccine to the few remaining survivors Step 3. World capitalist domination.  It doesn't make much sense but the writers seem completely ignorant as to how people could even walk upright without a permit from the Minister of Walking, let alone share, trade and cooperate freely to improve their lives.Most episodes are boring and predictable. I could live with that if there were some good visual shots of burning cities, sick and injured people or something but this isn't even filmed in HD.  It is 35mm film.  There are no special effects.  This is not a sci-fi series even if it is plugged as one.  Except for the death by genetically engineered virus, there is no science to be found anywhere.  The pharmaceutical stuff is mundane.  There is nothing imaginative or futuristic or alien or whatever.  It is not sci-fi. Maybe that would be OK too if there were at least some good philosophy or deep understanding of how people actually behave.  Had the writers sat down and read Hobbes, Locke, Marx, Rousseau and Machiavelli before starting this show, it might have been interesting.  Instead what you get is trite morality lessons, endorsements of banal political correctness and a bunch of sissies waiting for someone to save them but afraid to pick up a gun and save themselves.  I keep wanting to scream at them ""Your grandfathers defeated the Nazis and you are cowering because of some teenagers with a baseball bat!""  If the writers of this show reflect what the UK really thinks, Britain should be ashamed of what they have become.",2,boring display of British political correctness,1378684800,"09 9,

1332543,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0038MUZCA,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Dang, but the BBC puts on some good shows. SURVIVORS was one of them good shows, except that it came and went in a blink, and canceled after two series for not having garnered enough viewership. This sucks supremely. I'd been looking for a post-apocalyptic series on the telly to latch onto, ever since JERICHO got the bum's rush, and I had my eye on SURVIVORS. I highly recommend this show... if you don't mind that the second (and final) series ends on a cliffhanger.On this go-around, it's an unstoppable strain of influenza which kicks humanity to the curb, killing off 90% of the global population. The show focuses on a makeshift community of survivors in England, and it really is a particular treat to see repressed British people trying to cope. Associated themes crop up inevitably, mostly revolving around the retaining of one's humanity versus the adoption of sheer pragmatism and aggression in order to stay alive and even to propagate the human race. It's always that same question, right? How do you face the end of the world? With grace, or with teeth and claws? Whenever the infrastructure of society crumbles, it's sort of hard to fit in those civilized sessions of tea and scones.The cast is a diverse one. Extraordinarily, the mantle of de facto leadership falls on a mother named Abby whose primary motivation is to find her vanished 12-year-old son. Abby is the one who coaxes this pack of strangers to stick together, and she provides the group's moral linchpin. Other members consist of a self-sufficient loner, a rich (and shiftless) playboy who ends up taking a teenager under his wing, a young doctor who'd renounced her calling, and a complex stone-cold killer.This show didn't last long enough to really explore this desolate new world, and it certainly wasn't special effects heavy. The writers instead focus on strong character development and the premise certainly lends to plenty of fodder. To me, the real hook is Tom Price (Max Beesley), the killer in the midst who now finds himself in a savage world that fits him like a glove. Beesley plays Tom Price as almost inscrutable, very hard to read - and there are many moments when he's just so still - but he lets you know that something seethes underneath the stoic expression. Tom is always assessing and re-assessing. And when he wants to, he exudes a chilling menace. Tom Price early on turns his attentions on Anya, the beautiful doctor (who doesn't want to let on that she's a doctor), and I seriously didn't know where this was going. But, as this relationship evolved, it quickly became my favorite one to follow. Tom reminds me of a murderous but absolutely loyal guard dog. He would kill without remorse to keep Anya safe. Tom and Anya are polar opposites. Anya (Zoe Tapper) hopes for a better world and she cares about people. Tom's first resort is that of violence and intimidation. And isn't love sweet?Outside forces intrude on our group's struggles for survival. Apparently, the British government still exists, shakily, in the shape of a lone government minister fighting to regain order. Because, even in highly contagious pandemics, a politician, like a roach, is sure to make out okay. Abby and her group get tangled up in the minister's increasingly dark schemes.Technological amenities are still available for some. Ominous helicopters are glimpsed over the skyline. Black-clad paratroopers scour the empty cityscapes for survivors, except that these soldiers aren't fueled by charity or good will. Somewhere, there is a science laboratory conducting some very sinister experiments. And it's Abby Grant's pure bad luck that she had originally caught the deadly influenza but then survived it. Some very bad men are looking for her now, to open her up, see what makes her tick.So many things unresolved and unexplored. SURVIVORS' budget didn't allow for a more epic canvas, and so what we get are the little personal stories, many desperate moments of human drama, and I loved these, especially since the episodes do manage to inject action sequences here and there and enough doses of conspiracy intrigue. It's fascinating to observe the shifts of loyalties and personal ties in the group. It's sobering that most of the survivors the group encounters shape more into Tom Price's mold, and how most people in power cling to that  very dangerous maxim: ""We do what we must for the greater good."" It's also fascinating how Abby and the others see Tom, regarding him as this unsavory character and yet so very much dependent on his brutal skills to help keep them alive. Lovely Anya struggles with this the most. I do seem to go on and on about Tom and Anya, huh? Max Beesley and Zoe Tapper, they work these characters so well. To reiterate, it sucks supremely that SURVIVORS got the axe.Now I'm eyeing the original 1970s series.Five DVDs compile the twelve episodes making up the first and second series. Regarding bonus material, Disc 2 has ""A New World: The Making Of SURVIVORS"" (00:26:34 minutes long); Disc 3 offers ""Character Profile"" clips on series characters Abby Grant (00:04:37), Tom Price (00:04:28), and Greg Preston (00:03:21) and a SURVIVORS special effects segment which features the CGI team touching up the abandoned freeway scene (where Al and Nadj play soccer) and also fabricating the explosion at the petrol station (00:05:48).",4,"""So few of us left.

Many reviewers have noted the fact that the series ended on a cliff-hanger because apparently there was hope there would be a season three.

The plot chronicles how they must now live without electricity, gas, and the modern conveniences we all take for granted (like a grocery store full of food).I like the premise of the story itself, but also the excellent writing.  The characters are real, diverse, and interesting to get to know as a viewer. The screenplay dialogue is always surprising and fresh.

1332548,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B0038MUZCA,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[4, 4]","SURVIVORS is another captivating BBC drama that tries to answer the question:  What happens when a horrifically virulent plague wipes out 90% of the world's population resulting in total anarchy, lawlessness, and the collapse of civilization?  With only two seasons of only 6 episodes each, SURVIVORS keeps you fascinated and wanting more.SURVIVORS is a remake of a 1970's series based on a novel by Terry Nation (the creator of Doctor Who).  The series is remarkable in its atmosphere.  The horror of mass death, the realization that only 10% of the population is left, the loss of power, transportation, medical care, communication, law, government are all well done and very believable.  You really feel for these characters and are completely drawn in.  How do you go on when everyone you know has died?  How do you continue to survive, when there are no groceries, no clean water, no medicine?  And no way to bury the millions of dead bodies...But what is really interesting about SURVIVORS, what really makes it tick, are the characters who are given a second chance at life.  SURVIVORS focuses on a small group of very diverse people who are now thrown together in an almost familial unit:  Abby (Julie Graham), the matriarch who is determined to find the son she's convinced is still alive; Tom (Max Beesley), the convict who was doing time murder when the virus struck; Anya (Zoe Tapper), the pretty young doctor; Greg (Peterson Joseph), the untrusting loner whose life had already been falling apart; Al (Phillip Rhys), a rich, lazy playboy who can't do anything for himself; and Najid, a devout, 11-year-old Muslim.  How has the global tragedy changed them?  Can the convict reform?  Will the doctor ever practice medicine again, or has she seen too much horror?  Will the playboy suddenly grow up?  Watching these people, their interactions with each other, and their reactions to both the plague and how to go on is what keeps the audience coming back each espisode.  Can they remake themselves?  Can they overcome all obstacles and keep on living?My only criticism of SURVIVORS is that the story lines get a bit repetitive after awhile.  The ""family"" doesn't seem to learn from their mistakes from week to week.  Hey, it is h-e-double-tooth-picks out there; to really survive these folks need to learn a little faster.Over all, though, SURVIVORS is worth watching.  There are a number of continuing story arcs, and luckily, several of them are tied up nicely by the end of season 2.  Since the series has, unfortunately, been cancelled, I am very glad that a few things, at least, had been resolved.

1332549,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B0038MUZCA,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[40, 41]","For me to call this series the best show today, is a lot. I watch too much TV and expect a lot out of television shows. Survivors is one of the best shows I've ever seen (barring Firefly). It is smart, the actors are excellent, the story is at once human, horrible, and thrilling. The first few episodes when the virus sweeps through England and everyone is dying were a bit rocky - but you have to start somewhere. Around the middle of the first season, when the group consisting of seven people were forming as a sort of family - even though they were strangers to each other, Survivors begins to shine. The brilliance of this series is how these people are very different from each other, but somehow manage to hold on to civility in the face of incredible inhumanity, which is very real and quite frightening as you watch it unfold. Each character holds his or her own in this series, something one rarely sees on television today. Abby is the matriarch - a very kind, maternal woman before the virus, becomes a very strong, central character who holds this ragtag group together and to a level of humanity others cannot seem to do. Tom is the strong, silent mystery man who holds himself separate, but as the story progresses becomes more and more the other half of Abby. We learn he is a murderer and doesn't have the moral balance that Abby has, but the two are almost a perfect complement to each other regarding this family. Greg starts out kind of wimpy, but under Abby and the family's influence blossoms as a man of great character and intelligence. This ""family"" is the focus of Survivors as they deal with the aftermath of almost complete annihilation of society as we know it. We see one group trying to establish some sort of government, but the flaws are outstanding. We see another who enslaves people to try to jump start an industrial society again. We see groups of people without hope, food, decent water, shelter, and most of all, direction. In the middle of this chaos is Abby's ""family."" I really hope this show goes on for a very long time, and I hope people will start watching it to continue its longevity. Too many fantastic shows are canceled before their time and this show is too good to end. I highly recommend this one to all of my friends and family and am buying it to share with them.

1332551,AAW58LG72PG7I,B0038MUZCA,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","End of the world dramas have been around since, well, man first began to explore the concept. What these dramas reveal suggests that humanity in the aggreggate (pre-collapse) is not that much different from the hunted and harried survivors.  If human beings are foolish, egotistical, self-sacrificing, or optimistic, they will continue to be so even after the Apocalypse.  In the BBC drama, SURVIVORS, the team directors collaborated to present a vision of a plague-infested England that within a few days killed nearly one hundred percent of the population.  Those who survived were few, dispirited, or driven by a messianic desire to re-establish Law & Order, even if that meant the reimposition of a society that smacked more of white-coated mad scientists than it did of true humanitarians. This BBC drama is based on a book by Terry Nation, who thirty years earlier (1975) wrote a script of the same name and contained much of the plot, characters, and themes that he would update for this production.  I have seen both versions, and though this one is a clear remake, these survivors ultimately learn that the greatest threat to their collective ongoing existence lies not in the plague and a collapsed infrastructure but rather in the competing visions of themselves as to how their Brave New World will play itself out.  These visions are for the most part mutually exclusive.  One simply cannot have a slave labor Gulag mentality patched onto a libertarian commune mindset that yet values the Magna Carta or the American Bill of Rights.The first episode is a 90 minute introduction in which the viewer is treated to a rapidly collapsing England.  A lethal flu, begun in China, has spread world wide and thanks to jet travel, has infected the entire globe within days. The dead and dying soon outnumber the living.  Essential services (police, hospitals, power) disappear.  The series protagonist is Abby Grant (Julie Graham), who emerges as one of the few who refuse to allow her humanity to similarly vanish.  She spends all the the series' 16 episodes seeking her teenage son who may have also avoided the plague.  Abby falls victim to the flu but recovers, thus ensuring that her blood may hold the key to a future antidote.  Abby meets other survivors and unconsciously organizes them into an organic entity that is frequently fractured by external events and internal squabbling.  The series regulars include an escaped prisoner Tom (Max Beesley), a doctor Anya (Zoe Tapper), an uncommunicative loner Greg (Peterson Joseph), a rich Arab playboy Al (Phillip Rhys), and a devout Muslim boy Najid.  What this disparate group shares is a belief that takes most of the first season to take root, namely that they must learn to care for the fates of their informally adopted family before they can hope to find individual satisfaction and happiness.  Viewers have complained that several of the episodes have a formulaic quality about them.  The survivors must contend with personal differences exacerbated by frequent contact with assorted loonies and crazies.  Yet, it is precisely this interaction between Abby's maternal ""family"" and competing visions of hostile others that give SURVIVORS an unforgettable air.  It is reasonable to assume that some aspect of central government has also survived and when representatives of this government appear led by a minor government minister (well played by Nikki Amuka-Bird) it becomes clear that the need to re-establish an efficient government must first answer the tricky question as to what type of government is sought.  Abby has met far too many individual non-elected power-seekers to submit meekly to power-seekers wearing outmoded badges of authority.  All around the assorted survivors are the shards of a fractured civilization.  Whether, these survivors can re-integrate their similarly fractured moral compasses into a Greater Whole for the Greater Good is the key question that causes viewers to tune in regularly for an answer that SURVIVORS provides even if many watching do not like this post-apocalyptic vision.  SURVIVORS truly is one of the best dramas of this or any age.",5,This Is the Way the World Ends: With a Bang and a Whimper,1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,4146,"['End', 'world', 'dramas', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'man', 'first', 'began', 'explore', 'concept', 'What', 'dramas', 'reveal', 'humanity', 'aggreggate', 'pre-collapse', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'different', 'hunted', 'harried', 'survivors', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'foolish', 'egotistical', 'self-sacrificing', 'optimistic', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'so', 'even', 'Apocalypse', 'BBC', 'drama', 'SURVIVORS', 'team', 'directors', 'collaborated', 'present', 'vision', 'plague-infested', 'England', 'few', 'days', 'killed', 'nearly', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'population', 'who', 'survived', 'were', 'few', 'dispirited', 'driven', 'messianic', 'desire', 're-establish', 'Law', 'Order', 'even', 'meant', 'reimposition', 'society', 'smacked', 'more', 'white-coated', 'mad', 'scientists', 'did', 'true', 'humanitarians', 'BBC', 'drama', 'based', 'book', 'Terry', 'Nation', 'who', 'thirty', 'years', 'earlier', '1975', 'wrote', 'script', 'same', 'name', 'contained', 'much', 'plot', 'characters', 'themes', 'would', 'update', 'production', 'have', 'seen', 'versions', 'one', 'clear', 'remake', 'survivors', 'ultimately', 'learn', 'greatest', 'threat', 'collective', 'ongoing', 'existence', 'not', 'plague', 'collapsed', 'infrastructure', 'rather', 'competing', 'visions', 'how', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'visions', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'One', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'slave', 'labor', 'Gulag', 'mentality', 'patched', 'libertarian', 'commune', 'mindset', 'yet', 'Magna', 'Carta', 'American', 'Bill', 'Rights.The', 'first', 'episode', '90', 'minute', 'introduction', 'viewer', 'treated', 'rapidly', 'collapsing', 'England', 'A', 'lethal', 'flu', 'begun', 'China', 'spread', 'world', 'wide', 'thanks', 'jet', 'travel', 'infected', 'entire', 'globe', 'days', 'dead', 'dying', 'soon', 'living', 'Essential', 'services', 'police', 'hospitals', 'power', 'disappear', 'series', 'protagonist', 'Abby', 'Grant', 'Julie', 'Graham', 'who', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'refuse', 'allow', 'humanity', 'similarly', 'vanish', 'series', '16', 'episodes', 'seeking', 'teenage', 'son', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'also', 'avoided', 'plague', 'Abby', 'victim', 'flu', 'recovers', 'thus', 'ensuring', 'blood', 'may', 'hold', 'key', 'future', 'antidote', 'Abby', 'other', 'survivors', 'unconsciously', 'organic', 'entity', 'frequently', 'fractured', 'external', 'events', 'internal', 'squabbling', 'series', 'include', 'escaped', 'prisoner', 'Tom', 'Max', 'Beesley', 'doctor', 'Anya', 'Zoe', 'Tapper', 'uncommunicative', 'loner', 'Greg', 'Peterson', 'Joseph', 'rich', 'Arab', 'playboy', 'Al', 'Phillip', 'Rhys', 'devout', 'Muslim', 'boy', 'Najid', 'What', 'disparate', 'group', 'shares', 'belief', 'most', 'first', 'season', 'take', 'root', 'namely', 'must', 'learn', 'care', 'fates', 'informally', 'adopted', 'family', 'can', 'hope', 'find', 'individual', 'satisfaction', 'happiness', 'Viewers', 'have', 'complained', 'several', 'episodes', 'have', 'formulaic', 'quality', 'survivors', 'must', 'contend', 'personal', 'differences', 'exacerbated', 'frequent', 'contact', 'assorted', 'loonies', 'crazies', 'Yet', 'precisely', 'interaction', 'Abby', 'maternal', 'family', 'competing', 'visions', 'hostile', 'others', 'give', 'SURVIVORS', 'unforgettable', 'air', 'reasonable', 'assume', 'aspect', 'central', 'government', 'also', 'survived', 'when', 'representatives', 'government', 'appear', 'led', 'minor', 'government', 'minister', 'well', 'played', 'Nikki', 'Amuka-Bird', 'clear', 'need', 're-establish', 'efficient', 'government', 'must', 'first', 'answer', 'tricky', 'question', 'what', 'type', 'government', 'sought', 'Abby', 'met', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'individual', 'non-elected', 'power-seekers', 'submit', 'meekly', 'power-seekers', 'wearing', 'outmoded', 'badges', 'authority', 'assorted', 'survivors', 'are', 'shards', 'fractured', 'civilization', 'Whether', 'survivors', 'can', 're-integrate', 'similarly', 'fractured', 'moral', 'compasses', 'Greater', 'Whole', 'Greater', 'Good', 'key', 'question', 'viewers', 'tune', 'regularly', 'answer', 'SURVIVORS', 'even', 'many', 'watching', 'do', 'not', 'post-apocalyptic', 'vision', 'SURVIVORS', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'dramas', 'age']",Survivors: Complete Seasons One & Two

However, some of the elements of the story were way to jerky and unconvincing. Without spoiling the story for anybody, I would just like to say that I question the erratic characterization of the political leadership of the new human colony. Also, I thought the young female doctor character tended to be all over the place.Something I always find surprising (and unconvincing) about many of these post apocalyptic type stories is how willing people are to leave a group and go off on their own, even when the environment is so unbelievably hostile. There are several characters like that in this story, both minor and major characters. I'm just not buying that. Humans are social creatures and seek comfort in numbers. Why would that change when the vast majority of your society is either dead or psychotic?Ah well.

1332557,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0038MUZCA,trebe,"[0, 0]","Survivors (2008-10) is a BBC production based on a book by Terry Nation that ran for two seasons, each with six episodes.  The story follows a group of people in Britain, in the aftermath of a worldwide pandemic that leaves few left alive.  This version is the second BBC adaptation of Nation's work, as a series of the same name was also produced in the mid-1970's.  Some spoilers follow.The story opens just as a global pandemic goes critical, and kills most of the world's population.  In Britain, Abby Grant (Julie Graham) contracts the virus, but somehow manages to survive.  With everyone dead, Abby leaves her suburban home to search for her son Peter, who is away at school.  While on the road, Abby meets Greg Preston (Paterson Joseph), and they decide to travel together.  They find other survivors, that include Anya Raczynski (Zoe Tapper) a doctor, escaped convict Tom Price (Max Beesley), playboy Al Sadiq (Phillip Rhys), and Najid Hanif (Chahak Patel), a young boy.Banding together, the group takes up residence in a large house.  They forage for food and supplies from supermarkets, and homes, but somehow don't seem to gather any weapons or many tools.  On one of their forays, they are challenged by another band of survivors, led by a dislikable fellow named Dexter (Anthony Flanagan), who threatens them with a shotgun.Joined by Sara (Robyn Addison), the group works together peaceably, while Abby ventures off alone, looking for her son.  Abby finds a high tech settlement being run by Samantha Willis (Nikki Amuka-Bird), a former Government minister.  Willis seems rational, but has radical plans for the rebirth of a new government.  In the finale of Season One, with Dexter as her aide, Willis attempts to begin to implement her distorted vision.  Things turn violent, as Greg is shot, and Abby is abducted.The second season opens with Abby a prisoner at a research facility headed by a scientist named Whitaker (Nicholas Gleaves), who reports to a man named Landry (Patrick Malahide), the head of a pharmaceutical corporation.  Having survived the virus, Abby's blood can be used to create a vaccine, and she is reinfected in order to increase the strength of the antibodies in her blood.Abby miraculously escapes, and reunites with the rest of the group.  Leaving London, they encounter a trucker named Billy (Roger Lloyd Pack), who is much more than he appears.  While Abby and Greg recover, Price is captured, put on trial, and found guilty by Willis' group.  Abby's group mounts a rescue mission, but Willis proves to be quite devious, as Tom and Greg become slaves in a coal mine.After another rescue, the survivors find refuge with a group of female farmers, and tragedy soon strikes.  Abby decides to return to the research lab, and allow the team to use her to develop a vaccine.  But an outbreak has occurred, and Abby's son Peter (Jack Richardson), becomes a player in a deadly game that brings the mysterious Mr. Landry out of hiding.Survivors features some interesting characters and is generally well acted, however as the first season progresses, the adventure becomes increasingly disconnected with reality.  The limitations of television, no doubt contributes to what is a very ""sanitized"" view of the complete breakdown of society.  Although there are some slow points, the level of action is markedly greater in Season Two, as there are few times when someone in the group is not in danger, or in need of rescue, which leads to an increase in the level of violence, and use of firearms.  And, more time is devoted to exploring and developing the relationships between the various characters.  With a stronger second season, the series rates 3.5 stars.While the writing falls short at times, and the program is probably not suitable for the whole family, Survivors is still an entertaining fantasy adventure, that also explores different aspects of morality.
