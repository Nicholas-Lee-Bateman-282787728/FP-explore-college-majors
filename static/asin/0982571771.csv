Whatever you choose to think on this, I find it interesting the comments musicians and executives say ""you can make yourself see or hear what you want to.""  But yet Judas Priest admit to doing things in prior albums just not the one that was bringing them to trial.  And Devo producer with his antics into commercials he worked on.  If original that part of subliminal messages being introduce actually had no effects of sells being increased, then why is it still being attempted?  Is it for fun?  Or is it for ""lets just do it incase it actually does do something?""  Makes one think there has to be some truth of its effects.  My only critique is the political part.  My one question is, when was this documentary actually done?  If it was actually released August of 2011, then why not equal coverage of Obama's slogans derived from some of the Communist slogans in the 2008 campaign?  Or the media biased / influence of 2008 campaign.  Truth or not, it was a subject of discussion that would seem to warrant ""let's take a look to see if there is anything to this so called conspiracy talk favoritism by media"".  I mentioned only based off of the Democracy Now woman mentioning that ""we have responsibility to present the facts.""  To me, it seems like a support of one party over another near the end of this film.  Just present something as well showing opposing party to the republican party.  One might say the documentary was ending on ""subliminally"" trying to present a one sided party with questionable issues rather than the other.",3,Subliminal political slant?,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,1587,"['Overall', 'was', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'choose', 'think', 'find', 'interesting', 'comments', 'musicians', 'executives', 'say', 'can', 'make', 'see', 'hear', 'what', 'want', 'yet', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'admit', 'doing', 'things', 'prior', 'albums', 'just', 'not', 'one', 'was', 'bringing', 'trial', 'Devo', 'producer', 'antics', 'commercials', 'worked', 'original', 'part', 'subliminal', 'messages', 'being', 'introduce', 'actually', 'had', 'effects', 'being', 'increased', 'then', 'why', 'still', 'being', 'attempted', 'fun', 'lets', 'just', 'do', 'incase', 'actually', 'do', 'something', 'one', 'think', 'there', 'be', 'truth', 'effects', 'only', 'critique', 'political', 'part', 'one', 'question', 'when', 'was', 'documentary', 'actually', 'done', 'was', 'actually', 'released', 'August', '2011', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'equal', 'coverage', 'Obama', 'slogans', 'derived', 'Communist', 'slogans', '2008', 'campaign', 'media', 'biased', '/', 'influence', '2008', 'campaign', 'Truth', 'not', 'was', 'subject', 'discussion', 'would', 'seem', 'warrant', 'let', 'take', 'look', 'see', 'anything', 'so', 'called', 'conspiracy', 'talk', 'favoritism', 'media', 'mentioned', 'only', 'based', 'Democracy', 'Now', 'woman', 'mentioning', 'have', 'responsibility', 'present', 'facts', 'support', 'one', 'party', 'end', 'film', 'Just', 'present', 'something', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'opposing', 'party', 'republican', 'party', 'One', 'might', 'say', 'documentary', 'was', 'ending', 'subliminally', 'trying', 'present', 'one', 'sided', 'party', 'questionable', 'issues', 'rather', 'other']",N/A

When you examine the definition of the word subliminal it means the existing or functioning below the threshold of consciousness. However, when I think of the definition of the word subliminal I think of something that is below to nonexistent on the radar, something that is secretly force fed to us or perhaps something communicated indirectly. Yet, when you look at the footage used as examples in this documentary, to me these &#8220;subliminal messages&#8221; are all in plain view, most I wouldn't even consider subliminal! We may think that our minds are registering our favourite colours, favourite foods or an appealing style, but there are four main forces that drive our lives: fight, flight, feeding and fornication.Could the use of subliminal messaging be contributing to the downfall of our social and economic society? I think partly yes. After all, the news, advertisements, movies, campaigns and music can all persuade us to buy or consume what&#8217;s being marketed. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s even a question of whether subliminal messages work or not. Of course they work (perhaps better on some compared to others). Just look at how so many political campaigns push their personal agendas with scare tactics and hidden messages to influence voters! In reference to the subliminal messages in music &#8220;You&#8217;ll find a way to hear or see what you want&#8221;&#8230;I mean, have we forgotten about the excellent example from the movie &#8216;The Number 23&#8217;? Not just that, but there have been studies of exposing volunteers to random photos with no subject matter and recording the mind&#8217;s way to find and distinguish something familiar to the volunteers.At the end of the day, you have to admit the product placement and marketing techniques while brilliant are also effective in one way or another. This film examines the key impacts that marketing and subliminal messaging carry when it comes to our critical thinking and free will as individuals.
