283995,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301973224,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Lonelyhearts, 1958 filmThis is a story about the newspaper business, the main source of information before television for most people (aside from rumor). A young man gets a job writing as &#8220;Miss Lonelyhearts&#8221; for the &#8216;Chronicle&#8217;, giving advice to people who are asking a stranger with unknown credentials. Adam White doesn&#8217;t like this assignment. [What else can he do?] It tells about some people&#8217;s lives and personalities, like a novel that is based on personal experiences. Aren&#8217;t those advice columns just a form of entertainment [like that &#8220;Jerry&#8221; show on TV]? Do not mistake them for an authority on proper behavior. Ever wonder if those letters were made up for comic effect? Or recycled from earlier years?Adam West&#8217;s father is in prison for killing his wife and her lover when Adam was a child; he was put in an orphanage. What effect did this have on his life? Adam&#8217;s column is criticized by the editor &#8220;for purely commercial reasons&#8221;. The headlines are filled with examples of people breaking the Ten Commandments and suffering afterwards. &#8220;People are animals.&#8221; Are people&#8217;s problems caused by their misdeeds? Adam is asked to contact one of the letter writers in person; he does so. This married woman visits Adam at his apartment. [A big mistake as a meeting place.] Her husband is &#8220;handicapped&#8221;. &#8220;It happens to men sometimes after an accident.&#8221; [Would family support have helped? Is this a drawback to a &#8220;nuclear family&#8221;?] A taxi drops the lady around the corner from her place. Adam goes to a local bar. A man recognizes him and confides in him. [What a coincidence!] He wants the letter his wife wrote. Adam can&#8217;t help him. We hear the other side of the complaint.Adam&#8217;s conscience bothers him. He learns his editor was right about people. [Or is it the people who write those letters?] &#8220;Those people don&#8217;t deserve to be laughed at.&#8221; Adam shows his anger. &#8220;No one knows where he can be reached&#8221; is the answer for that woman. Later Adam talks to his editor. &#8220;Leave me alone.&#8221; Adam tells about his true past. This creates another problem. What will happen to him now? Justy goes looking for Adam, for a second chance. Adam plans to leave his newspaper job. Doyle shows up with a revolver, what did his wife say? Can Adam defuse this explosive situation? Will he bend with the wind? Can he be persuaded to stay? Perhaps he&#8217;s sorry to go. &#8220;Hail and farewell.&#8221; Mr. Shrike turns out the lights.The value of this drama is to warn people about those advice columns in particular and other articles in general. Do you know if those articles on the editorial page and elsewhere are a form of paid advertising from lobbyists?

283999,A5WIS4K8Y2A2Y,6301973224,Franklin S. Jarlett,"[8, 9]","A fine example of melding stage and screen.  Debut film director Donehue had a stage background, lent a quality of intimacy to potent Dore Schary screenplay. Montgomery Clift, in obvious pain from disfiguring auto  accident, provides added pathos to pathetic character, burdened from woes  inflicted by cynical newspaper editor, sardonically played by Robert Ryan.  Myrna Loy, as his beaten down wife, matches Ryan's sophisticated polished  performance.  Supporting cast lends considerable credibility, best  supporting actress nomination for Maureen Stapleton well deserved.  Supporting cast well represented by  Frank Maxwell, Jackie Coogan and Mike  Kellin. Donehue's subtle direction completes ensemble production, with  Schary's personal views being intelligently injected without appearing  stagey. Sadly, Donehue died shortly after this film was completed. Schary  and Ryan had a productive history together in Hollywood, hallmarked by  landmark 1947's Crossfire.  Lonelyhearts ably shows both men's commitment  to fine film making, and they were reunited one final time for a tribute to  Schary on Ralph Edwards' This Is Your Life.

The cast is wonderful but the surrealistic novel is both adapted and directed as if it were a social reality tract. Clift is fine as a shattered center, uncomfortably true to his own life at the time, but he's truer to the source material than the film is, so seems at odds with it. Myrna Loy is wonderful in a part that hardly exists in the book, and could have been cut from the film. To give you an idea who should have directed this material, Cocteau would have been ideal. Or Ken Russell before he became Hollywood bloated. Other plays have been written from the novel, but it's a black poem, and like &quot;Locust&quot; perhaps no film could truly express it. All the same, see it, then find the book.

Especially, it seemed the moral problem was primary concern to him. LONELYHEARTS may not be a popular example among the Schary's creations, but it is the most sincere and well thought work from this socially conscious producer.At any rate, it was the first film done by Schary's independent production, therefore, the producer must had enjoyed considerable freedom over making the film. Furthermore, the producer wrote the screenplay by himself.  Schary promoted a stage director, Vincent J. Donehue for its director. It was Donehue's first film assignment, but he did a great job of making a worth while drama. Donehue was able to adopt the authentic theatrical dignity to LONELYHEARTS that the film actually is gripping as it was the live performance. He surely knew how to place actors and how to extract best of them.Monty Clift played Adam White, a sensitive writer for the Chronicle News Paper. When the time of the filming, Clift had personal problems, like drug use and alcoholism, but ironically, because of the problems, his performance was somewhat realistic portraying the troubled man with a broken heart. His Adam White is fragile as the thin ice. In another side stands Robert Ryan, the sarcastic editor of the Chronicle. Ryan's Bill Shrike is responsible for Adam's nervous breakdown, but Shrike himself is not without troubles. Ryan teamed with Schary in BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK, and the film was much more respected in the public, however, LONELYHEARTS allowed Ryan to enjoy more sensitive expression which emphasized the illness of mankind. Also, Maureen Stapleton is remarkable as the confused house wife, who seeks help from equally confused Adam.Some might say the resolution of the film, which put emphasis on forgiveness, is little indulgent, though it is undeniably important theme for the living, and its more and more so in this modern age in such we are struggling. LONELYHEATS was a quite pure film and it is successful projecting a solution to the modern day problems. Thus, the film should be respected again, and deserves its revival.",5,"Depressing, but undeniably beautiful film.",1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,2153,"['Producer', 'Dore', 'Schary', 'had', 'reputation', 'making', 'good', 'films', 'strong', 'social', 'messages', 'Especially', 'seemed', 'moral', 'problem', 'was', 'primary', 'concern', 'LONELYHEARTS', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'popular', 'example', 'Schary', 'creations', 'most', 'sincere', 'well', 'thought', 'work', 'socially', 'conscious', 'producer.At', 'rate', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'done', 'Schary', 'independent', 'production', 'therefore', 'producer', 'must', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'considerable', 'freedom', 'making', 'film', 'Furthermore', 'producer', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Schary', 'promoted', 'stage', 'director', 'Vincent', 'J.', 'Donehue', 'director', 'was', 'Donehue', 'first', 'film', 'assignment', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'worth', 'drama', 'Donehue', 'was', 'able', 'adopt', 'authentic', 'theatrical', 'dignity', 'LONELYHEARTS', 'film', 'actually', 'gripping', 'was', 'live', 'performance', 'surely', 'knew', 'how', 'place', 'actors', 'how', 'extract', 'best', 'them.Monty', 'Clift', 'played', 'Adam', 'White', 'sensitive', 'writer', 'Chronicle', 'News', 'Paper', 'When', 'time', 'filming', 'Clift', 'had', 'personal', 'problems', 'drug', 'use', 'alcoholism', 'ironically', 'problems', 'performance', 'was', 'somewhat', 'realistic', 'portraying', 'troubled', 'man', 'broken', 'heart', 'Adam', 'White', 'fragile', 'thin', 'ice', 'side', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'sarcastic', 'editor', 'Chronicle', 'Ryan', 'Bill', 'Shrike', 'responsible', 'Adam', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Shrike', 'not', 'troubles', 'Ryan', 'teamed', 'Schary', 'BAD', 'DAY', 'AT', 'BLACK', 'ROCK', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'respected', 'public', 'however', 'LONELYHEARTS', 'allowed', 'Ryan', 'enjoy', 'more', 'sensitive', 'expression', 'emphasized', 'illness', 'mankind', 'Also', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'remarkable', 'confused', 'house', 'wife', 'who', 'help', 'equally', 'confused', 'Adam.Some', 'might', 'say', 'resolution', 'film', 'put', 'emphasis', 'forgiveness', 'little', 'indulgent', 'undeniably', 'important', 'theme', 'living', 'more', 'more', 'so', 'modern', 'age', 'such', 'are', 'struggling', 'LONELYHEATS', 'was', 'quite', 'pure', 'film', 'successful', 'projecting', 'solution', 'modern', 'day', 'problems', 'Thus', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'respected', 'again', 'revival']",N/A

The latter encompass Robert Ryan, Myrna Loy and Montgomery Clift. The story line concerns an advise columnist for the lovelorn who gets ""slightly too involved"" with one of his (married!) readers. The movie then proceeds directly downhill. None of the roles gel and the substantial talents of all 3 are wasted. The major problem with LH is that it was originally a play. The stage origins are patently obvious and there is absolutely NO transition to the screen. The lines are appropriate for a play but certainly not for a movie with any sort of action or flow.  Ryan is wooden as a ""cynical, big city editor who has seen it all"". Loy plays his mousy, subjective wife and appears almost embarrassed at her inconsequential role. Clift is the hapless writer. The viewer expects some fireworks when his ""admirer's"" husband discovers their one night stand. The plot not only fails to thicken, it limply falls flat. LH was filmed in 1959, when Monty was still suffering physically and emotionally from his car crash. That much is starkly obvious here! The poor guy seems drugged. It is painful to watch him. We can all live with one poor movie. The only tragedy would be if viewers don't realize the superior work these 3 have done in so many other films.

284003,A2X25C107CSLOR,6301973224,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[12, 13]","In Patricia Bosworth's biography of Montgomery Clift, Clift is said to have hated the Dore Schary screenplay based on the novel by Nathaniel West and the play by Howard Teichman, calling it &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts meets Andy Hardy&quot;, a joke on Schary as head of MGM. Whilst the treatment changes the fate of the Christ-like figure played by Clift, the character still suffers. He is burdened by the anguish of those who write to his advice column, his editor (Robert Ryan) is in pathological rage over the infidelity of his wife, his father is in jail for killing his Clift's mother, and his girlfriend is so controlling and possessive that she wants to know his &quot;every thought&quot;. West's cynicism is prevalent in the Ryan character's ugliness - his contempt for humanity who he thinks are all fakes and frauds, and his humiliation of his wife as projected guilt over his own affairs. This all sounds pretty glum, and whilst I tend to agree with Clift's assessment of the Schary screenplay with the Clift romance with Dolores Hart as bland, one can be amused by the many ironies behind the scenes here. Casting Clift as a man who does not drink and one to dispense advice to the lost is laughable in light of Clift's alcoholism and shattered emotional state after his infamous car crash. However Clift remained a handsome man, perhaps even the change added character to his former face, and his shattered sensitivity makes his acting all the more remarkable. If him calling Hart &quot;dear&quot; and the way he leans on her reveals an essential falseness, the directness with Ryan more than compensates. Bosworth details the trouble the filmmakers had in capturing the scene where Clift punches someone, with Ryan finally providing the closeup, but Clift's pain afterwards is all too real. As Ryan's wife, Myrna Loy doesn't have much to do except be a masochist to Ryan's bile, but Maureen Stapleton is fun as a lonelyhearts letter writer who Ryan goads Clift into meeting. Stapleton's vengeful spite is very funny. Director Vincent J Donehue is said to have come from the theatre, which may explain the basic uncinematic style of the film, with the only notable visual image being a pan along a tree branch and back to suggest the passage of time.",4,Miss Lonelyhearts,995155200,"07 15, 2001",2001,2260,"['Patricia', 'Bosworth', 'biography', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Clift', 'said', 'have', 'hated', 'Dore', 'Schary', 'screenplay', 'based', 'novel', 'Nathaniel', 'West', 'play', 'Howard', 'Teichman', 'calling', 'quot', 'Miss', 'Lonelyhearts', 'Andy', 'Hardy', 'quot', 'joke', 'Schary', 'head', 'MGM', 'Whilst', 'treatment', 'fate', 'Christ-like', 'figure', 'played', 'Clift', 'character', 'still', 'burdened', 'anguish', 'who', 'write', 'advice', 'column', 'editor', 'Robert', 'Ryan', 'pathological', 'rage', 'infidelity', 'wife', 'father', 'jail', 'killing', 'Clift', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'so', 'controlling', 'possessive', 'know', 'quot', 'thought', 'quot', 'West', 'cynicism', 'prevalent', 'Ryan', 'character', 'ugliness', 'contempt', 'humanity', 'who', 'are', 'fakes', 'frauds', 'humiliation', 'wife', 'projected', 'guilt', 'own', 'affairs', 'pretty', 'glum', 'whilst', 'tend', 'agree', 'Clift', 'assessment', 'Schary', 'screenplay', 'Clift', 'romance', 'Dolores', 'Hart', 'bland', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'amused', 'many', 'ironies', 'scenes', 'here', 'Casting', 'Clift', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'drink', 'one', 'dispense', 'advice', 'lost', 'laughable', 'light', 'Clift', 'alcoholism', 'shattered', 'emotional', 'state', 'infamous', 'car', 'crash', 'However', 'Clift', 'remained', 'handsome', 'man', 'perhaps', 'even', 'change', 'added', 'character', 'former', 'face', 'shattered', 'sensitivity', 'acting', 'more', 'remarkable', 'calling', 'Hart', 'quot', 'dear', 'quot', 'way', 'reveals', 'essential', 'falseness', 'directness', 'Ryan', 'more', 'compensates', 'Bosworth', 'details', 'trouble', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'capturing', 'scene', 'where', 'Clift', 'someone', 'Ryan', 'finally', 'providing', 'closeup', 'Clift', 'pain', 'afterwards', 'too', 'real', 'Ryan', 'wife', 'Myrna', 'Loy', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'be', 'masochist', 'Ryan', 'bile', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'fun', 'lonelyhearts', 'letter', 'writer', 'who', 'Ryan', 'Clift', 'meeting', 'Stapleton', 'vengeful', 'spite', 'very', 'funny', 'Director', 'Vincent', 'J', 'Donehue', 'said', 'have', 'come', 'theatre', 'may', 'explain', 'basic', 'uncinematic', 'style', 'film', 'only', 'notable', 'visual', 'image', 'being', 'pan', 'tree', 'branch', 'back', 'suggest', 'passage', 'time']",N/A

Clift plays his  lead character a bit too tautly, and much of the time comes off as a  terrorized, wooden fellow who's had one too many snorts of his drug of  choice. Still, it's a human yarn full of poignancy, and the supporting  characters give fine performances. For a story based on the news business,  why wasn't this movie given more press?",4,"Underrated, gripping drama",948240000,"01 19, 2000",2000,692,"['tale', 'based', 'Nathaniel', 'West', '1930s', 'novel', 'quot', 'Miss', 'Lonelyhearts', 'quot', 'Adam', 'White', 'enigmatic', 'man', 'past', 'times', 'viewer', 'pause', 'cynical', 'newspaper', 'publisher', 'stuff', 'substance', 'human', 'nature', 'really', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'film', 'superb', 'many', 'layers', 'emotional', 'depth', 'Clift', 'lead', 'character', 'bit', 'too', 'tautly', 'much', 'time', 'off', 'terrorized', 'wooden', 'fellow', 'who', 'had', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'snorts', 'drug', 'choice', 'Still', 'human', 'full', 'poignancy', 'supporting', 'characters', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'story', 'based', 'news', 'business', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'given', 'more', 'press']",N/A
