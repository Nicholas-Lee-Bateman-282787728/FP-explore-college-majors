Like every other reviewer says, from Ike to Clinton, both verbal and physical.Presidential contenders also make the cut, so we get Dole, Gore, Quayle, McCain, and Jesse Jackson.  It'd be a shame not to get Quayle, wouldn't it?First ladies too, so we can Nancy fall down again and again, and Bess Truman steals the show.Why only three stars?  Because it's only 45 minutes long.",3,Extremely Funny,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,421,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'other', 'reviewer', 'Ike', 'Clinton', 'verbal', 'physical.Presidential', 'contenders', 'also', 'make', 'cut', 'get', 'Dole', 'Gore', 'Quayle', 'McCain', 'Jesse', 'Jackson', ""'d"", 'be', 'shame', 'not', 'get', 'Quayle', 'would', ""n't"", 'First', 'ladies', 'too', 'can', 'Nancy', 'fall', 'down', 'again', 'again', 'Bess', 'Truman', 'show.Why', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'only', '45', 'minutes', 'long']",N/A
548821,AHTIK199C24R1,B00004RF9Y,A. Genard,"[2, 2]","The program is funny but I wasn't exactly cracking up through the whole thing.  Some of the footage is priceless like Bush Sr. going down in that bowling alley, Dukakis falling off the platform and everything from Dan Quayle.  I was really hoping for more of the video of Clinton and Yeltsin laughing uncontrollably.  It appeared in the opening credits for about 2 seconds.  It's advertised on the back of the case for cryin out loud!  Some of the footage isn't funny at all.  It's been awhile since I've seen any bloopers video so I completely forgot about the stupid and annoying sound effects they add in.The technical aspects of the program and DVD are the real let-downs of this.  The volume level of the audio isn't constant and I found myself turning the volume up and down throughout the whole thing.  The video source they used is a dark print, making me almost squint through some of it.  Disappointing it's less than 40 min.  They could have CERTAINLY included an extra feature with bloopers from Dubya (this video was originally made in '99).  They could do a whole program on him alone.  Or just a review of his presidency, the biggest presidential blooper of all time.",3,Good but it fell a little short.,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,1182,"['program', 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'cracking', 'up', 'whole', 'thing', 'footage', 'priceless', 'Bush', 'Sr.', 'going', 'down', 'bowling', 'alley', 'Dukakis', 'falling', 'off', 'platform', 'everything', 'Dan', 'Quayle', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'more', 'video', 'Clinton', 'Yeltsin', 'laughing', 'uncontrollably', 'appeared', 'opening', 'credits', 'about', '2', 'seconds', 'advertised', 'back', 'case', 'cryin', 'loud', 'footage', ""n't"", 'funny', 'been', 'awhile', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bloopers', 'video', 'so', 'completely', 'forgot', 'stupid', 'annoying', 'sound', 'effects', 'add', 'in.The', 'technical', 'aspects', 'program', 'DVD', 'are', 'real', 'let-downs', 'volume', 'level', 'audio', ""n't"", 'constant', 'found', 'turning', 'volume', 'up', 'down', 'whole', 'thing', 'video', 'source', 'used', 'dark', 'print', 'making', 'almost', 'squint', 'Disappointing', 'less', '40', 'min', 'could', 'have', 'CERTAINLY', 'included', 'extra', 'feature', 'bloopers', 'Dubya', 'video', 'was', 'originally', 'made', ""'99"", 'could', 'do', 'whole', 'program', 'alone', 'just', 'review', 'presidency', 'biggest', 'presidential', 'blooper', 'time']",N/A

That is not the type of humor that I enjoy, but I really like the bloopers where somebody says the wrong thing. My favorites have to be those of Vice President Dan Quayle, most of his best are on this tape. Once again it was amazing to see him say such ridiculous things; the idea that he could have been president is terrifying.No one expects politicians to be perfect and everyone takes a tumble on occasion. However, as an educator it is incredible to watch these people saying such things. They are supposed to be professional public speakers and yet they fail when trying to utter what should be simple sentences. I find this more disturbing than some of the more publicized sexual escapades of politicians.There is some humor on this tape, but if you care about the quality of political figures, some of the statements will make you cringe, which is a form of dark humor.",2,"Some humor but absent the slapstick it is pretty dark, some of the statements are really stupid",1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,1044,"['are', 'fan', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'where', 'people', 'fall', 'down', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'portions', 'tape', 'where', 'presidential', 'candidates', 'wives', 'trip', 'slip', 'fall', 'not', 'type', 'humor', 'enjoy', 'really', 'bloopers', 'where', 'somebody', 'wrong', 'thing', 'favorites', 'have', 'be', 'Vice', 'President', 'Dan', 'Quayle', 'most', 'best', 'are', 'tape', 'Once', 'again', 'was', 'amazing', 'see', 'say', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'president', 'terrifying.No', 'one', 'politicians', 'be', 'perfect', 'everyone', 'tumble', 'occasion', 'However', 'educator', 'incredible', 'watch', 'people', 'saying', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'professional', 'public', 'speakers', 'yet', 'fail', 'when', 'trying', 'utter', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'simple', 'sentences', 'find', 'more', 'disturbing', 'more', 'publicized', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'politicians.There', 'humor', 'tape', 'care', 'quality', 'political', 'figures', 'statements', 'will', 'make', 'cringe', 'form', 'dark', 'humor']",N/A

A few of them were before my time but still very funny.  It was surprising to see how many of them made a klutz of themselves and bounced right back as if nothing happened.
