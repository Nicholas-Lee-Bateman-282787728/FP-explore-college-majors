Why was he sent there? ""I really don't know."" Five assaults, statutory rape. Was he faking his condition? We see the patients trying to function in a discussion group. [Does it drag here?] You can see their problems. [What is the point of all this?] Basketball? The patients are medicated. Who wants to watch the ""World Series""? Another therapy session, another vote. ""The meeting is adjourned."" McMurphy reports on the game. More trouble? McMurphy talks to the Doctors. [Is this a good sign?]Can McMurphy make an escape in daylight? Yes, and he brings Candy to the boys. Next they take a boat ride. What will they catch fishing? Their trip comes to an end. Voluntary or committed? McMurphy's activities go on. He is given ""electroshock therapy"". [Did it ever do any good?] McMurphy continues to break the rules in defiance.

99199,A2S166WSCFIFP5,0790732181,"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com""","[2, 2]","In 1962, one of the most important writers of his generation, Ken Kesey, wrote a book titled One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It was an instant classic and best-seller. For good reason.Over ten years later Milos Forman made a film version of Kesey's book. Also an instant classic. It's a story about friendship, courage, cruelty, and sanity. Admittedly the film did not take on the mental health institutions the way the novel did, but the film did create one of our most coldest and memoriable villains, Nurse Ratchett. And everyone knows Chief. Forman and D.O.P. Haskell Wexler shot the film in a bleak style. Nicholson gave one of his best performances, as did Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratchett (both won Academy Awards for their performances). There is a great supporting cast, including two superb performances by Danny DeVito and Brad Dourif. This film won many awards. Truly one of the greatest movies of all times, and while I wouldn't say it is better than Kesey's book (it isn't), I would suggest that everyone read the novel and watch the film.As for the dvd, it was a bit of a letdown. There is no commentary or behind the scenes. Just the movie and a few pages of production notes (which actually were quite interesting). No special features. But it's in letterbox, the picture and sound quality are better than VHS, so if you don't own this movie yet, go ahead and buy it on dvd.",5,A Classic,1021680000,"05 18, 2002",2002,1393,"['1962', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'writers', 'generation', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'wrote', 'book', 'titled', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'was', 'instant', 'classic', 'best-seller', 'good', 'reason.Over', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'made', 'film', 'version', 'Kesey', 'book', 'Also', 'instant', 'classic', 'story', 'friendship', 'courage', 'cruelty', 'sanity', 'Admittedly', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'mental', 'health', 'institutions', 'way', 'novel', 'did', 'film', 'did', 'create', 'one', 'most', 'coldest', 'memoriable', 'villains', 'Nurse', 'Ratchett', 'everyone', 'Chief', 'Forman', 'D.O.P', 'Haskell', 'Wexler', 'shot', 'film', 'bleak', 'style', 'Nicholson', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'did', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'Nurse', 'Ratchett', 'won', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'performances', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'two', 'superb', 'performances', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'film', 'won', 'many', 'awards', 'Truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'times', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'better', 'Kesey', 'book', ""n't"", 'would', 'suggest', 'everyone', 'read', 'novel', 'watch', 'film.As', 'dvd', 'was', 'bit', 'letdown', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'Just', 'movie', 'few', 'pages', 'production', 'notes', 'actually', 'were', 'quite', 'interesting', 'special', 'features', 'letterbox', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'better', 'VHS', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'movie', 'yet', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'dvd']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

99203,A1KVSBMU1R4GVU,0790732181,Alicia Adams,"[0, 0]","""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" takes place in a state hospital just prior to the deinstitutionalization movement in the 1960s.  The main character is R.P. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson.McMurphy is brought to the hospital in handcuffs.  In his intake interview with Dr. Spivey, the ward doctor, he is initially polite and seems normal.  Dr. Spivey reviews his history of belligerent behavior.  McMurphy is a criminal with five arrests for assault, and a more recent charge of statuary rape.  At the prison farm, he was rebellious and lazy, and has now been sent to the state hospital to determine if he is mentally ill. McMurphy shows no remorse and makes light of his behavior.  For instance, when asked about the rape, he claims that the girl was sixteen and told him she was eighteen, that she was eager for sex, and that any man would have done the same as he did.Although McMurphy claims that there is nothing really wrong with him, he is kept at the state hospital and placed under Nurse Ratchard's authority.  Nurse Ratchard is a grim woman who keeps strict control of the eighteen men on her ward.  There are voluntary patients who pass their days by smoking and playing cards, and more severely disabled patients who live in their own worlds.  None of the men have any real control over their lives, and no one seems to have much chance of getting any better.  Indeed no one seems to care very much if they get better or not.The treatment given consists of medications and group therapy sessions led by Nurse Ratchard, whose version of therapy has more in common with police interrogation than the client-centered therapy envisioned by Rogers.  Nurse Ratchard grills the patients about their personal problems and makes them more anxious and insecure than before.  Most of them are obviously terrified of her, and she seems to like it that way.  Yet McMurphy continually challenges her authority and refuses to be intimidated.  He uses his powers of persuasion and manipulation to lead the other men against her.  First he calls for a vote on watching the World Series (contrary to the usual routine) and later he steals a bus and takes the other men on an unauthorized deep sea fishing trip upon a stolen boat.  He seems to think that there will be no consequences for his behavior because he is already in a mental institution.  However, when he and two other patients fight with the ward orderlies, all three are given electroshock therapy as a punishment - a blatent violation of their rights.  Again, McMurphy makes light of it and assures everyone that he has not been subdued.After learning that the institution has the power to hold him indefinitely, McMurphy plans an escape with a friend.  However, he wants to perform one more act of defiance before leaving the hospital.  He sneaks in women and alcohol and throws a huge party for the other men.  During the wild night, he passes out from drinking and misses his chance to escape before Nurse Ratchard comes in the morning.  She is furious when she discovers what has happened and takes it out on young Billy Bibbit, an anxious and sometimes suicidal patient who has always been easy for her to manipulate.  Unable to handle her harsh attack, Billy kills himself.  Enraged, McMurphy turns on Nurse Ratchard and chokes her.  A male nurse intervenes before she dies, but her neck is injured, requiring a brace.  McMurphy is then removed to another ward where he is subjected to a lobotomy that leaves him in a vegetative state.  When returned to Nurse Ratchard's ward in that condition, his grieved friend quietly suffocates him and then carries out the escape plan that McMurphy had devised for the two of them.The adversarial relationship between McMurphy and Ratchard was harmful to both of them and to the others around them.  If only someone had intervened before things turned tragic!  Perhaps with a more understanding nurse and more respectful treatment, McMurphy could have used his influence over the other patients in a positive way.",4,McMurphey versus Nurse Ratchard,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,4020,"['One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'place', 'state', 'hospital', 'just', 'prior', 'deinstitutionalization', 'movement', '1960s', 'main', 'character', 'R.P', 'McMurphy', 'played', 'Jack', 'Nicholson.McMurphy', 'brought', 'hospital', 'handcuffs', 'intake', 'interview', 'Dr.', 'Spivey', 'ward', 'doctor', 'initially', 'polite', 'normal', 'Dr.', 'Spivey', 'history', 'belligerent', 'behavior', 'McMurphy', 'criminal', 'five', 'arrests', 'assault', 'more', 'recent', 'charge', 'statuary', 'rape', 'prison', 'farm', 'was', 'rebellious', 'lazy', 'now', 'been', 'sent', 'state', 'hospital', 'determine', 'mentally', 'ill.', 'McMurphy', 'remorse', 'light', 'behavior', 'instance', 'when', 'asked', 'rape', 'girl', 'was', 'sixteen', 'told', 'was', 'eighteen', 'was', 'eager', 'sex', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'McMurphy', 'nothing', 'really', 'wrong', 'kept', 'state', 'hospital', 'placed', 'Nurse', 'Ratchard', 'authority', 'Nurse', 'Ratchard', 'grim', 'woman', 'who', 'strict', 'control', 'eighteen', 'men', 'ward', 'are', 'voluntary', 'patients', 'who', 'pass', 'days', 'smoking', 'playing', 'cards', 'more', 'severely', 'disabled', 'patients', 'who', 'live', 'own', 'worlds', 'None', 'men', 'have', 'real', 'control', 'lives', 'one', 'have', 'much', 'chance', 'getting', 'better', 'Indeed', 'one', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'get', 'better', 'not.The', 'treatment', 'given', 'consists', 'medications', 'group', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'led', 'Nurse', 'Ratchard', 'version', 'therapy', 'more', 'common', 'police', 'interrogation', 'client-centered', 'therapy', 'envisioned', 'Rogers', 'Nurse', 'Ratchard', 'patients', 'personal', 'problems', 'more', 'anxious', 'insecure', 'before', 'Most', 'are', 'obviously', 'terrified', 'like', 'way', 'McMurphy', 'continually', 'authority', 'be', 'intimidated', 'powers', 'persuasion', 'manipulation', 'lead', 'other', 'men', 'First', 'vote', 'watching', 'World', 'Series', 'contrary', 'usual', 'routine', 'later', 'bus', 'other', 'men', 'unauthorized', 'deep', 'sea', 'fishing', 'trip', 'stolen', 'boat', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'consequences', 'behavior', 'already', 'mental', 'institution', 'However', 'when', 'two', 'other', 'patients', 'fight', 'ward', 'orderlies', 'three', 'are', 'given', 'electroshock', 'therapy', 'punishment', 'blatent', 'violation', 'rights', 'Again', 'McMurphy', 'light', 'everyone', 'not', 'been', 'subdued.After', 'learning', 'institution', 'power', 'hold', 'indefinitely', 'McMurphy', 'escape', 'friend', 'However', 'perform', 'one', 'more', 'act', 'defiance', 'leaving', 'hospital', 'women', 'alcohol', 'huge', 'party', 'other', 'men', 'wild', 'night', 'out', 'drinking', 'chance', 'escape', 'Nurse', 'Ratchard', 'morning', 'furious', 'when', 'what', 'happened', 'out', 'young', 'Billy', 'Bibbit', 'anxious', 'sometimes', 'suicidal', 'patient', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'easy', 'manipulate', 'Unable', 'handle', 'harsh', 'attack', 'Billy', 'Enraged', 'McMurphy', 'Nurse', 'Ratchard', 'male', 'nurse', 'intervenes', 'neck', 'injured', 'requiring', 'brace', 'McMurphy', 'then', 'removed', 'ward', 'where', 'subjected', 'lobotomy', 'vegetative', 'state', 'When', 'returned', 'Nurse', 'Ratchard', 'ward', 'condition', 'grieved', 'friend', 'quietly', 'then', 'out', 'escape', 'plan', 'McMurphy', 'had', 'devised', 'two', 'them.The', 'adversarial', 'relationship', 'McMurphy', 'Ratchard', 'was', 'harmful', 'others', 'only', 'someone', 'had', 'intervened', 'things', 'turned', 'tragic', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'understanding', 'nurse', 'more', 'respectful', 'treatment', 'McMurphy', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'influence', 'other', 'patients', 'positive', 'way']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Opening night cast included Kirk Douglas as R.P. McMurphy, Ed Ames as Chief Bromden, William Daniels as Dale Harding, Gerald S. O'Loughlin as Cheswick and Arlene Golonka as McMurphy's ladyfriend, Candy Star and Gene Wilder as Billy Bibbit.This film adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel won Oscars for Best Picture, director Milos Forman, star Jack Nicholson, co-star Louise Fletcher and Best Screenplay. It was the first movie since Frank Capra'sIT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT(1934) to sweep these major categories. ""Cuckoo's Nest"" grossed over $112 million (in 1975 dollars).SYNOPSIS--Randle McMurphy is sent from state prison to a psych hospital for evaluation. When he bets with other patients that he can ""put a bee in Nurse Ratched's bonnet,"" McMurphy isn't aware that his misbehavior may doom him to be held indefinitely and far beyond the term of his prison sentence. Although there are several comical moments in this story, there's far more dramatic and ultimately tragic ones, including scenes of such ""therapies"" as restraints, shock treatment and lobotomy.The cast, many of whom are relative newcomers, is a brilliant one. Kudos to Brad Dourif in his second film, as the tragic Billy Bibbit and to 6' 4"" Creek Indian, Will Sampson as the ""deaf & dumb"" Chief Bromden. This is the sort of movie that bears up well to repeated viewings and is one that belongs in every serious video collector's home library.Also available onDVD.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(8.9) One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) - Jack Nicholson/Louise Fletcher/Will Sampson/Christopher Lloyd/Danny DeVito/Vincent Schiavelli/William Redfield/Brad Dourif/Scatman Crothers",5,"McMurphy: ""I must be crazy to be in a loony bin like this.""",1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,1891,"['1989', 'CANNON', 'Group', 'videotape', 'full', 'screen', 'SP', 'speed', 'dub', 'clean', 'HiFi', 'audio.ONE', 'FLEW', 'THE', 'CUCKOO', 'NEST', 'premiered', 'Broadway', '11/13/63', 'had', 'short', '82', 'performance', 'run', 'closed', '1/25/64', 'Opening', 'night', 'cast', 'included', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'R.P', 'McMurphy', 'Ed', 'Ames', 'Chief', 'Bromden', 'William', 'Daniels', 'Dale', 'Harding', 'Gerald', 'S.', ""O'Loughlin"", 'Cheswick', 'Arlene', 'Golonka', 'McMurphy', 'ladyfriend', 'Candy', 'Star', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Billy', 'Bibbit.This', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'novel', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Picture', 'director', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'star', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'co-star', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'Frank', ""Capra'sIT"", 'HAPPENED', 'ONE', 'NIGHT', '1934', 'sweep', 'major', 'categories', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'grossed', '112', 'million', '1975', 'dollars', '.SYNOPSIS', 'Randle', 'McMurphy', 'sent', 'state', 'prison', 'psych', 'hospital', 'evaluation', 'When', 'other', 'patients', 'can', 'put', 'bee', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'bonnet', 'McMurphy', ""n't"", 'aware', 'misbehavior', 'may', 'doom', 'be', 'held', 'indefinitely', 'far', 'term', 'prison', 'sentence', 'are', 'several', 'comical', 'moments', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'dramatic', 'ultimately', 'tragic', 'ones', 'including', 'scenes', 'such', 'therapies', 'restraints', 'shock', 'treatment', 'lobotomy.The', 'cast', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'relative', 'newcomers', 'brilliant', 'one', 'Kudos', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'second', 'film', 'tragic', 'Billy', 'Bibbit', '6', '4', 'Creek', 'Indian', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'Chief', 'Bromden', 'sort', 'movie', 'up', 'well', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'one', 'serious', 'video', 'collector', 'home', 'library.Also', 'available', 'onDVD.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '8.9', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', '1975', 'Jack', 'Nicholson/Louise', 'Fletcher/Will', 'Sampson/Christopher', 'Lloyd/Danny', 'DeVito/Vincent', 'Schiavelli/William', 'Redfield/Brad', 'Dourif/Scatman', 'Crothers']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
99212,A1534MBU6VJXYN,0790732181,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[1, 1]","In terms of movies that had deep, meaningful storylines, expert writing, great actors and great directors, no era can beat the 1970s'. One hardly can hardly argue with this assertion, since films like ""The Godfather"", ""The Last Picture Show"", ""Nashville"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Godfather Part II"" and this 1975 masterpiece based on Ken Kesey's novel all came from this era.In ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", Jack Nicholson plays Randall P. McMurphy, a slightly maniacal man who is placed in a state mental hospital for an evaluation. There he encounters a stunning group of social misfits, wackos and mentally challenged people (played adeptly by future stars Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito as well as renowned character actor Vincent Schiavelli). He also encounters Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a heartless woman whom McMurphy vows to drive crazy within one week. At first McMurphy is taken aback by his new surroundings. But as the film progresses, McMurphy developes a profound understanding for his fellow inmates, which ultimately helps him become a better man.This film is truly excellent. Although Nicholson had been making movies for quite some time and made some excellent films (""Easy Rider"", ""Five Easy Pieces"", ""Carnal Knowledge"", ""The Last Detail"", ""Chinatown""), this was the film that gave him his first of three Oscars and cemented him as the Brando-esque acting god he's considered as today. Louise Fletcher also won an Oscar for her fiery portrayal as Nurse Ratched. He plays the role with the kind of intensity possessed by classic movie villians like Norman Baits and even some of Nicholson's characters, but comes off as less of a pyschopath and more of a miserable wench, which is essentially what her character is. Fletcher captures the character to a tee and deserved the Oscar. Another actor who deserves mention is Danny DeVito. Even though he only has a small role as Martini, he imbues the character with genuine sincerity, and this is probably my second favorite performance by him (his portrayal of the Penguin in ""Batman Returns"" is my first).To put this in simple terms, this film is an absolute must have and one of the best films ever made.

And Jack Nicholson is perfect in the role of McMurphy, who managed to get himself transferred from the jail to the mental hospital because he thought it would be easier. Guess again.The special feature material on this two-disc set helps explain why it was so very accurate. And take it from someone who has been on both sides of the keys in mental hospitals (worked in one as one of my first jobs; patient in several during my wicked hippie days), it is quite authentic. It was filmed in a real state hospital (Oregon, I think), and the actors spent a good bit of time there before they started to shoot. Also, the director was smart enough to let them ad-lib and adjust their lines and the stage direction to what they had observed of real patients in the hospital.Louise Fletcher, who plays Big Nurse, is just exactly the right combination of smarmy sweet and undertone of hard steel to accurately portray the sort of people who rise to positions of responsibility in such an institution. She is 100% control freak. She also knows how to twist everything to make it sound like it's the patients doing it to themselves. You want to call her evil, but you know she probably does believe that this is what is best for the patients.One scene that will live forever is the group session in which McMurphy discovers that all of the other patients on the ward are voluntary commitments who could leave any time they wanted. His shock at this is so heartbreaking, and he plays it perfectly.My favorite character is Chief, the huge native American who goes from a very convincing catatonia to McMurphy's rescuer.

99220,ALR35EFI69S5R,0790732181,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[4, 5]","I remember first viewing this superb movie on a wide-screen in 1975 while living in Utah, and the electrifying effect of the final few scenes on everyone in the theater audience. Many people were openly sobbing, including my better half, and even I have to admit to having a few misty moments myself. Indeed, the final few frames made us all want to stand up and shout in exclamation, so powerful was the series of images on the screen. My wife and I talked about it for weeks, and finally went back to see it again. There is no way around it folks, this is a fabulous film, a modern classic that no one in Hollywood had the chutzpah to bring to the screen despite the fact that both the original late Ken Kesey novel and the stage play adaptation were both runaway successes. In 1972 we saw Al Pacino play McMurphy in a wonderful stage production of the work, and was amazed both by the material and the acting.The play had opened on Broadway to rave reviews, with Kirk Douglas playing the lead part. He stayed long enough to win a Tony as best actor for his performance, and promptly bought the movie rights and began plans to bring this cautionary allegory of modern society to the screen. For years he attempted to gain backing, but despite his box office appeal and hi sown reputation, was unable to convince anyone that he was the man to play McMurphy. Finally, he dropped the script and moved on to other projects, including his work in the tragically ignored performance in Elia's Kazan's ""The Arrangement"", which also deals with both cultural alienation and mental illness, as does OFOTCN. It wasn't, however, until Kirk's son Michael blew the dust off the manuscript of the screenplay and employed the legendary Milos Foreman to direct it, and also convinced Jack Nicholson to commit to the project that the Douglas family production team were able to bring the project to fruition.Why go through all this history? Simply to show what a wonderful gift this film is for the movie-going public.  Randall Patrick McMurphy, malingerer and petty career mal-content, believes he has discovered the perfect way to spend his latest sentence, avoiding the drudgery of prison by feigning mental illness to get assigned for diagnostic workup and possible treatment in a state mental institution, not realizing that the time spent there does not count toward his sentence. Thinking he has the perfect place to hide, he soon begins to realize the institution is in complete control of his time, energy, and consciousness. Given his inability to submit or conform, he is soon locked in the battle of his life for his self-control, his self-hood, and his very sanity. The setting is an allegory of what modern society is like, and how it imposes its priorities, its view of reality, and its demands for how we participate both within it as well as with each other. As we come to care about what happens to McMurphy and the whole zany crew of loveable loonies, we also recognize McMurphy is on a dangerous and unavoidable collision course with Big Nurse Ratched (played magnificently by Louise Fletcher).The movie is supported by a stellar cast, including Danny DeVito, Will Sampson, Scatman Crothers, and Christopher Lloyd. The scenery is gorgeous, as the primitive and open landscape of the Oregon coastline provides a contrasting world of order and beauty to the hellhole the mental ward seems to be. A turning point in the movie comes when McMurphy discovers he is the only involuntary in-patient, the only one who cannot walk out by simply signing some forms and collecting his clothes. Nicholson's amazing facial turns of expression graphically show what he is so desperately feeling, the final glimpse of land by a man going down into the water for the last time!

Jack Nicholson gives one hell of a classic and memorable performance in this film directed by the great Milos Forman. Nicholson plays Randall McMurphy, a rebel inmate of sorts at a psychiatric hospital who fights the system and refuses to give in the hospital's orders or behavior. It's a real groundbreaking film. Nicholson's main adversary is the cold Nurse Ratchett(great name!), played superbly by Louise Fletcher. A remarkable performance. There are also a number of familiar faces in the film. You will definitley recognize Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, and Brad Douriff, as some of the inmates. Will Sampson also gives a memorable performance. There are scenes here that are truly shocking. Anyone who has seen this probably knows what I mean when I say that. All of our actors are dead on perfect as mentally unstable patients.

It is an electrifying and compelling story of one man against the system, and unlike a lot of other 70's dramas, never seems dated.Since most people interested have already seen the movie, it would be pointless for me to give a synopsis. But what cannot be over emphasized is the strong performances from both Jack Nicholson in the lead role as a petty crook commited to a mental institution, and Louise Fletcher as the cold and blunt nurse. Much of the movie centers around the duality between them, and it makes for some great dialogue. Nicely rounding out the cast is a young Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd, obviously in the springtime of their careers.I held off from getting this movie on DVD because the earlier version was bare-bones and was a mediocre transfer. This newly released 2 DVD set is a fantastic buy, with a whole new video and sound transfer that makes you forget that 25 years have passed since it was made. This is by far the best print ever released. The extras also add good measure, such as the documentary (which is a shorter version of the one found on the laserdisc edition) and full-length commentary from the Director and Producers. While the extras aren't exactly overflowing in this edition, they are worth the price of admission.&quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; remains one of the most entertaining and important films ever made, and like other classics such as &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot;, will stand the test of time. It is funny, moving, and tough-provoking, which is a rareity in modern cinema.

He's just gotten himself committed to the nuthouse in order to escape work detail at the prison. McMurphy figures he's hit the jackpot! He believes he's fooled everyone, and will simply coast out his remaining term. Then he meets nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), the jagged rocks upon which McMurphy's freedom boat will crash. Nurse Ratched is a pompous, manipulative, poker-faced witch. She hides a seething evil behind her blank expression. McMurphy takes her on, thinking he can defeat her with his sarcasm and wit. All he wants is to let the other &quot;nuts&quot; have a little fun in their otherwise dull, suffocatingly controlled lives. He breaks out and takes them all on a fishing trip at sea. He gets the guys to play blackjack, and acts out the play-by-play of an imaginary ballgame when nurse Ratched foils his plans to watch the world series on TV. Finally, McMurphy sneeks booze and babes into the ward. Nurse Ratched is NOT amused! She must show McMurphy who is truly in command. OFOTCN is a tale of institutional terror. Should anyone, regardless of mental state, be treated like children? Should they be controlled / medicated in a way that turns them into vegetables? Can &quot;professionals&quot; be trusted with the care of those they are supposed to help? Or will they just warehouse them, treating them like animals in captivity? What if the doctors or nurses themselves are secretly, silently harmful? This movie explores some of the darkest recesses of humanity, leaving us with lots of questions and a lump in our throat.

Everything from anger to happy to funny to sad.  As to answer some of the questions that some people asked about the film such as: ""is it legal to do labotomy?""  Yes it was legal to do labotomy to problem patients, but that was a long time ago.  Though I beleive the doctors would have thought long and hard for the treatment they would have provided it is not impossible for an aggressive clinic to give shock therapy to problem patients and labotomy.  It just seems ridiculous nowadays because we know better, the law protects us and we simply understand such acts are inhumane.  Shock therapy was given to patients who misbehaved frequently and as a control they would shock them.  Some doctors did feel Jack was a problem so they shocked him.  That was not unusual back then either.  Neither was lobotomy and yes it was legal back then as well.  It is not legal anymore.  The idea of lobotomy back then was to have patients have less aggressive behavior.  However, those who gave it less stars because of they are basing judgement on nowaday morals and laws they are wrong because labotomy was perfectly legal and so was shock therapy (which is still now I believe.)  The point of the movie was to make you feel something and feel sympathy for Jack because of his character shows that you dont need all those shock therapy, labotomy, pills to make a person better mentally.  Jacks character did it by providing happiness and friendship to the other patients in the clinc which kinda like Patch Adams accomplished in that movie.

99231,AR2T3NOGFNIUH,0790732181,"Bradford VS ""Bradford V.""","[3, 4]","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) is one of the greatest American films of all time - a $4.4 million dollar effort directed by Czech Milos Forman. Its allegorical theme is set in the world of an authentic mental hospital (Oregon State Hospital in Salem, Oregon), a place of rebellion exhibited by a energetic, flamboyant, wise-guy anti-hero against the Establishment, institutional authority and status-quo attitudes (personified by the patients' supervisory nurse). [Forman himself noted that the asylum was a metaphor for the Soviet Union (embodied as Nurse Ratched) and the desire to escape.]Expressing his basic human rights and impulses, the protagonist protests against heavy-handed rules about watching the World Series, and illegally stages both a fishing trip and a drinking party in the ward - leading to his own paralyzing lobotomy.Jack Nicholson's acting persona as the heroic rebel McMurphy, who lives free or dies (through an act of mercy killing), had earlier been set with his performances in Easy Rider (1969) and Five Easy Pieces (1970). The mid-70s baby-boomers' counter-culture was ripe for a film dramatizing rebellion and insubordination against oppressive bureaucracy and an insistence upon rights, self-expression, and freedom. Here Nicholson takes his incredible skills as an actor to new levels.  I can't picture any other actor pulling this performance off.See this film for humanity it sheds and the dramatic ending which will haunt you.  The film has many dramatic arcs and a very believable antagonist in Nurse Ratched.

Macmurphy,  a former prisoner,  has been sent to a mental hospital for evaluation.  He has been charged with brutality and rape,  making the doctors believe there may be signs of mental illness.  What ensues is an incredible movie about one man's struggle to survive in a mental hospital and the effect he has upon the other patients.  Jack Nicholson won his first lead actor Oscar for his performance in Cuckoo's nest.  He is simply unbelievable.  He was very due for an oscar.  This was his 4th nomination.  Fellow nominee Walter Matthau,  upon hearing Nicholson's name announced,  was said to have leaned over to his wife and said &quot;It's about time.&quot;  Louise Fletcher won an Oscar for best actress in her unforgettable turn as Nurse Ratched,  the stern facilitator of the mental ward.  There are many patients and people who would soon become big stars,  such as Danny Devito,  Christopher Lloyd,  Louis Gossett Jr., and an amazing performance by Sydney Lassick.  The real deal is Milos Forman,  the winner for best director,  and the man behind such films as Amadeus(His 2nd Oscar for Direction),  The People V. Larry Flynt,  and Man on the Moon.  He even used real mental ward patients to add realism to the film.  This film was produced by a young Michael Douglas,  earning him his first Oscar.

99238,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,0790732181,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[97, 111]","Milos Forman has always had a knack for assembling great ensemble casts. This is particularly true in his most critically acclaimed releases (Taking Off, Amadeus and this film). It would be difficult indeed to come up with actors and actresses who were better suited to fill the roles in OFOTCN. This is true in terms of both the stars, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher, and the secondary characters. Who could have been a better Harding than William Redfield? A better Billy Bibbit than Brad Dourif? A better Cheswick than Sydney Lassick? And most especially, a better Chief Bromden than Will Sampson?I rank this movie as the best of the  best of what I consider to be American Cinema's golden decade, the 70s. It certainly won the widest acclaim, with its sweep of the major Oscars for 1975 (Nicholson also won best actor from the New York Film Critics voters that year).Not to be overlooked is the fantastic job performed by the film's adaptors, Bo Goldman and Lawrence Hauben, who also won Oscars for their screenplay. True, they did have a fairly decent stage version (by Dale Wasserman) to work with. I remember seeing an excellent production of the play, with a terrific cast, in San Francisco circa 1972. Just as an aside, I read in the Norton Critical edition of the novel, a review of a NY production of the play by Walter Kerr that was an absolute pan. Suffice it to say that the movie is much different than either the novel or the play. Those familiar with Kesey's great novel understand how difficult a transfer from page to screen would be; about a third of the story is Bromden's delusional interior monologue. The final script, quite rightly, focuses almost exclusively on Randal P McMurphy's struggle with Nurse Ratched for the hearts and minds of the inmates.This is truly a gut and soul-wrenching movie, with many moments of high maniacal comedy interspersed. Though many of his other films are top-notch, this is Forman's masterpiece. If you haven't read the book, read it. It you don't own this movie, buy it.

99248,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,0790732181,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 4]","First a quick synopsis of the movie - a criminal (in a marvelous performance by Jack Nicholson) &quot;pretends&quot; to be insane to get out of prison and spend his sentence in a mental hospital.  When he discovers that he's stuck in the hospital until he's certified sane by his doctors (rather than the length of his sentence) he plans to break out, with the help of selected fellow patients.  Along the way, his acts of rebellion against authority become a type of therapy for the patients, much more effective than that delivered by the medical staff.This movie won a number of awards, and seems brilliant and refreshing today, given the claptrap Hollywood is currently producing.  While I do not think Louise Fletcher's performance is great, most would disagree, including the Academy.  The other performances are all brilliant, starting with Nicholson, and moving right down the list through the supporting characters.The movie, while brilliant, is not always entertaining.  It's not perfect, and there are parts that are even mundane, which lowers its score slightly from the 5-star level.  The quality of the DVD drops it to three stars.  The sound and picture are both not very good - I have 1950's B-grade movies with higher quality.  The extras are non-existent.

99249,A10HIGTSU45VAI,0790732181,CriticNic,"[1, 1]","I had the pleasure of finally watching this classic starring Jack Nicholson, and I can't believe its taken so long to get around to it. The film has been a staple on the IMDb top 250, lingering near the top (it's at #12 at the time of this article) for as long as I can remember, so its a wonder why I haven't set aside time to check it out much sooner. On the other hand, there's a cool feeling about watching a classic film for the first time. We often watch great films and remember that feeling we had seeing it for the first time, wondering what it would feel like seeing it for the first time again. Watching classics long after their initial release is taking a journey into a different time and place, with often different philosophies on film making which makes it a whole different experience when compared to watching a new film.The film stars the versatile Jack as McMurphy, a rebellious misfit who gets sent to a mental institution after previously serving at a prison work camp. In no time McMurphy brings his brand of breaking-the-rules fun to the other patients. For most, he does far more than what the medical practitioners can, treating them as regulars and showing them to a good time. Needless to say he gains a quick following with the patients, but is under the close eye of the facilities authorities, mainly the head nurse, Nurse Ratched.The film focuses on one thing impeccably: characters. The colorful bunch of patients are more than just looneys talking to themselves. They each have their own story and distinct personality. Many scenes involve the characters simply interacting, whether it be during a group therapy session or a game of cards. Their personalities show through every line and every action they're involved in. This is one thing that is so easy for films to overlook, as surprising as it would seem. It's easy to get wrapped up in the plot and the action and put aside a character's past, feelings, and overall place in the big picture. Cuckoo's Nest places focus on the characters, which gives it an advantage in being a piece of humanity over a piece of entertainment.Escaping the facility is only a small part of the movie. While that would seem McMurphy's original agenda, as the film goes on and he becomes closer to the inmates, it becomes much more philosophical. In fact, McMurphy has several chances to escape, which isn't really a spoiler. The film to me is really about how he changes during his stay at the hospital, and how he changes his new group of friends.It became clear to me how this film has stood the test of time and is still considered one of the greatest films ever made. You don't often see a film today that takes place primarily in one location, nor one that places so much emphasis on characters and feelings rather than action-driven plots. It goes without saying that Jack Nicholson is one of the greatest actors of all time (he won an Oscar for his performance), and his moving performance here is only enhanced by the supporting cast. A film like this needs a strong cast to be pulled off, and there don't seem to be a lot of actors that can demand such attention as they do in this movie. While it certainly is tough to make an enjoyable film, its perhaps more difficult for a film such as this to keep the viewer's attention without being boring. That to me was the true test that this film passed, and I'd go as far to say it is unrivaled in that regard.I can't discuss this film without mentioning the very surprising ending. While I found it to be quite sad, it had very poetic and mystical feeling to it. In the big picture though, it fit the rest of the film and really added an extra level of mental perplexity. The ending is just yet another aspect that sets it apart from other movies. When it could go one way that might please the audience more, it takes a different direction that is more in line with the rest of the film. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a real exemplary piece of film that illustrates that while times have changed, our humanity has not.Source: criticnic.com 5 December 2012",5,A true classic,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,4088,"['had', 'pleasure', 'finally', 'watching', 'classic', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'film', 'been', 'staple', 'IMDb', 'top', '250', 'lingering', 'top', '12', 'time', 'article', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'wonder', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'set', 'aside', 'time', 'check', 'out', 'much', 'sooner', 'other', 'hand', 'cool', 'feeling', 'watching', 'classic', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'often', 'watch', 'great', 'films', 'remember', 'feeling', 'had', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'feel', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'again', 'Watching', 'classics', 'long', 'initial', 'release', 'taking', 'journey', 'different', 'time', 'place', 'often', 'different', 'philosophies', 'film', 'making', 'whole', 'different', 'experience', 'when', 'compared', 'watching', 'new', 'film.The', 'film', 'versatile', 'Jack', 'McMurphy', 'rebellious', 'misfit', 'who', 'sent', 'mental', 'institution', 'previously', 'serving', 'prison', 'work', 'camp', 'time', 'McMurphy', 'brand', 'breaking-the-rules', 'fun', 'other', 'patients', 'most', 'far', 'more', 'what', 'medical', 'practitioners', 'can', 'treating', 'regulars', 'showing', 'good', 'time', 'Needless', 'say', 'gains', 'quick', 'following', 'patients', 'close', 'eye', 'facilities', 'authorities', 'mainly', 'head', 'nurse', 'Nurse', 'Ratched.The', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'impeccably', 'characters', 'colorful', 'bunch', 'patients', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'looneys', 'talking', 'have', 'own', 'story', 'distinct', 'personality', 'Many', 'scenes', 'involve', 'characters', 'simply', 'interacting', 'be', 'group', 'therapy', 'session', 'game', 'cards', 'personalities', 'show', 'line', 'action', ""'re"", 'involved', 'one', 'thing', 'so', 'easy', 'films', 'overlook', 'as', 'surprising', 'would', 'seem', 'easy', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'plot', 'action', 'put', 'aside', 'character', 'past', 'feelings', 'overall', 'place', 'big', 'picture', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'places', 'focus', 'characters', 'advantage', 'being', 'piece', 'humanity', 'piece', 'entertainment.Escaping', 'facility', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'movie', 'would', 'seem', 'McMurphy', 'original', 'agenda', 'film', 'closer', 'inmates', 'much', 'more', 'philosophical', 'fact', 'McMurphy', 'several', 'chances', 'escape', ""n't"", 'really', 'spoiler', 'film', 'really', 'how', 'stay', 'hospital', 'how', 'new', 'group', 'friends.It', 'became', 'clear', 'how', 'film', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'still', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'film', 'today', 'place', 'primarily', 'one', 'location', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'emphasis', 'characters', 'feelings', 'rather', 'action-driven', 'plots', 'saying', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'time', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'moving', 'performance', 'here', 'only', 'enhanced', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'strong', 'cast', 'be', 'pulled', 'off', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'lot', 'actors', 'can', 'demand', 'such', 'attention', 'do', 'movie', 'certainly', 'tough', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'perhaps', 'more', 'difficult', 'film', 'such', 'keep', 'viewer', 'attention', 'being', 'boring', 'was', 'true', 'test', 'film', 'passed', ""'d"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'unrivaled', 'regard.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'film', 'mentioning', 'very', 'surprising', 'ending', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'sad', 'had', 'very', 'poetic', 'mystical', 'feeling', 'big', 'picture', 'fit', 'rest', 'film', 'really', 'added', 'extra', 'level', 'mental', 'perplexity', 'ending', 'just', 'yet', 'aspect', 'apart', 'other', 'movies', 'When', 'could', 'go', 'one', 'way', 'might', 'please', 'audience', 'more', 'different', 'direction', 'more', 'line', 'rest', 'film', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'real', 'exemplary', 'piece', 'film', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'humanity', 'not.Source', 'criticnic.com', '5', 'December', '2012']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Jack Nicholson in his oscar winning performance as R.P. McMurphy chanels everything that makes Jack the actor he is for a once in a lifetime performance.  McMurphy has five accounts of assault and is facing jail time, so he decides that a term in a mental ward has got to be better than the pen, so he fakes insanity (sort-of) so he can serve his sentence in different suroundings.  Once in the door though, it's not so easy to leave again.  He has to face down Nurse Ratched (Louse Fletcher in a very tame, subdued yet powerful performance that also won her the oscar) and Nurse Ratched is not easily persuaded...just watch the debate over watching the world series.  There are many scenes in this film that are staples in movie history, many scenes that stand out as what movies are supposed to be, and the acting on all fronts is spot-on.  A young Danny DeVito plays the innocent and playful Martini, and Christopher Lloyd in his first roll plays the very memerable Taber.  But it's, of course, Jack Nicholson that steals every scene, although I have to say that Sydney Lassick as Cheswick was some very hard competition...he was perfect in his role...just watch his tantrum over cigarettes.  Anyways, this is one of those films you should be required to see, but your not so many may not have seen it...I just hope that after reading this review you'll go out and rent it ASAP.

McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who is sent to a mental hospital to be evaluated for possible mental disorders.  McMurphy is placed in a ward with seventeen other patients and begins to cause quite a stir with his outrageous behavior.  Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) holds daily therapy sessions with the group to help facilitate healing with their illnesses and after a while, the relationship between McMurphy and the nurse becomes a powder-keg waiting to explode.  This sets up the rest of the film where McMurphy realizes that his evaluation may be extended indefinitely and has to deal with his situation in extraordinary terms.The movie is brilliant in the way it deals with a sensitive issue in a dignified and positive way.  It's not designed to make you laugh at the patients, but rather have you laugh and feel pain with them.  Of course the greatest stroke of genius is the way Jack Nicholson leads the awaking of these confined individuals and brings some to a higher state of mental health.  It's not that he's doing it by design; it's simply because of his outgoing, funloving and confrontational personality that infuses energy, confidence and self-awareness in the other patients.  On the reserve side, the movie paints a scathing indictment against the medical system in the way it treats their patients.  The movie won five Oscars including best picture, actor and actress.

Soon after his admittance the men on the ward are punished for smoking cigarettes and not allowed to watch the World Series on TV. Nicholson of course opposes such severe punishment - because the World Series means so much to the men.Nicholson then decides what the men really need for their mental illness (in addition to cigarettes) is liquor, so he acquires cases of booze for the patients to have a wonderful time.Nicholson has so many clever witty lines that he becomes lovable to those who admire defiant antisocial behavior. One reviewer described it well when he said it was a ""gut and soul-wrenching movie, with many moments of high maniacal comedy interspersed.""There is very shy young man on the ward with a severe stuttering problem. Who else has the answer but Nicholson? He knows, without it being said, that the boy's stuttering must be coming from sexual repression; so Nicholson arranges (I don't remember how) for a prostitute to be brought onto the ward and they lock the women in the room all night with the boy who stutters. In the morning after spending the night with the prostitute, the boy's stuttering completely stops! He is now self assured, confident and speaks clearly.When the head nurse learns about what had happened, she asks the boy, ""What would your mother think if she knew about what you have done?""  Immediately the boys stuttering returns and he becomes again the shy, pathetic, trembling person he was before. At that point in the film, many young men in the audience of the theater where I watched the film stood and screamed, ""KILL THE BITCH, KILL HER, KILL HER, KILL HER!"" Those words and the screaming, I will never forget! Makes me wonder what those boys will think of their own mothers who want them to be moral, and decent.The film ends when a great big Indian smothers Nicholson (Crucifies the savior of the patients in the hospital and the savior of mental illness) with a pillow. The giant Indian then rips out a water cooler and with super human strength heaves the cooler through the bars and window of the hospital which he runs through to get away. I guess this was supposed to symbolize that patients in mental institutions need to break free from Cuckoo hospitals and from a repressive society that has made them mentally ill.Jack Nicholson who was committed to the hospital for the ""F"" word and for fighting was the hero who ""flew over"" in the film because he was the only one who really understood the causes of mental illness. That's brilliant, isn't it? One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest that won 5 Academy Awards is about as Cuckoo as a film could get.What did the film really teach? That mental illness is caused by a society that represses indulgence; and that mental health is achieved by satisfying all of our appetites, no matter how base or how carnal; and if anyone tries to dissuade us, be it a nurse, a teacher or a mother, they deserve to be killed!Academy awards and 284 people giving this film a 5 star rating tells us how sick our society is. Read the comments for a confirmation of this.See all of my Reviews.

99257,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,0790732181,David Baldwin,"[6, 8]","This film has a special place in my heart because it was the first film I saw starring Jack Nicholson.  When he first appears on screen here after being uncuffed by the guards, you can feel the whole screen just light up with Jack's burning charisma.  I was determined to seek out after this anything I could with Nicholson because Jack was the man(""Goin South"", anyone?).  When ""Cuckoo's Nest"" came out in 1975 Nicholson had already established himself as a star in films.  The only thing that he needed was that shiny gold statuette to validate him as a legend.  Anyone who read Ken Kesey's book on which this was based would agree that Nicholson was born to play R.P. McMurphy.  A rebel stuck in a psychiatric ward would afford Nicholson the opportunity to chew the scenery.  Watching this film again recently I was struck how subdued his performance is here.  Not to be overlooked is Louise Fletcher's performance as the controlling Nurse Ratched.  Her work here is very much the equal of Nicholson's.  The temptation to play this part broadly may have been there, but Fletcher plays her in an understated manner that not so much imbues sympathy for her character but pathos.  The strong supporting cast here includes Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and most effectively Brad Dourif as Billy, an introverted patient who Ratched probably exhibits the most control over.  One weakness of the film is the casting of ChiefBromden, a large deaf and dumb Indian played by Will Sampson.  In Kesey's book, Bromden is the narrator of the story.  The only thing Sampson brings to the part is that he is a big Indian.  Praise also must be given to director Milos Forman, a recent emigre to this country from Czechoslavakia for translating this American story to big screen and to Bo Goldman for adapting Kesey's novel, even though at the time Kesey wasted little time in trashing the film.  On a final note, a few years ago I was fortunate to have seen the stage adaptation of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" in New York with Gary Sinise playing McMurphy.  Expecting a re-enactment of the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this production had their own unique interpretation of the material.  As far as Sinise's portrayal, let's just say you would not confuse his interpretation of McMurphy with Jack Nicholson's.",5,Nicholson Shines (Again),1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,2320,"['film', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'saw', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'When', 'first', 'screen', 'here', 'being', 'uncuffed', 'guards', 'can', 'feel', 'whole', 'screen', 'just', 'light', 'up', 'Jack', 'burning', 'charisma', 'was', 'determined', 'seek', 'out', 'anything', 'could', 'Nicholson', 'Jack', 'was', 'man', 'Goin', 'South', 'anyone', 'When', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'came', 'out', '1975', 'Nicholson', 'had', 'already', 'established', 'star', 'films', 'only', 'thing', 'needed', 'was', 'shiny', 'gold', 'statuette', 'validate', 'legend', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'would', 'agree', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'R.P', 'McMurphy', 'A', 'rebel', 'stuck', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'would', 'afford', 'Nicholson', 'opportunity', 'chew', 'scenery', 'Watching', 'film', 'again', 'recently', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'subdued', 'performance', 'here', 'Not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'performance', 'controlling', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'work', 'here', 'very', 'much', 'equal', 'Nicholson', 'temptation', 'play', 'part', 'broadly', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'Fletcher', 'understated', 'manner', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'imbues', 'sympathy', 'character', 'pathos', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'here', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'most', 'effectively', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Billy', 'introverted', 'patient', 'who', 'Ratched', 'probably', 'most', 'control', 'One', 'weakness', 'film', 'casting', 'ChiefBromden', 'large', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'Indian', 'played', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'Kesey', 'book', 'Bromden', 'narrator', 'story', 'only', 'thing', 'Sampson', 'part', 'big', 'Indian', 'Praise', 'also', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'director', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'recent', 'emigre', 'country', 'Czechoslavakia', 'translating', 'American', 'story', 'big', 'screen', 'Bo', 'Goldman', 'adapting', 'Kesey', 'novel', 'even', 'time', 'Kesey', 'wasted', 'little', 'time', 'trashing', 'film', 'final', 'note', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'fortunate', 'have', 'seen', 'stage', 'adaptation', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'New', 'York', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'playing', 'McMurphy', 'Expecting', 're-enactment', 'film', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'production', 'had', 'own', 'unique', 'interpretation', 'material', 'As', 'far', 'Sinise', 'portrayal', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'would', 'not', 'confuse', 'interpretation', 'McMurphy', 'Jack', 'Nicholson']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

McMurphy, a small-time convict who feigns insanity for a transfer to a mental hospital, which he thinks will be an easier place to do his time. On the contrary, he finds himself in conflict with Nurse Rached (Louise Fletcher), who seems to be more interested in control than therapy. This film is in the same vein as &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;: the protagonists of both films are irrepressible individuals whose refusal (or inability) to acknowledge authority puts them squarely into direct conflict with a system that ultimately destroys them physically without conquering their spirits. &quot;Cuckoo's Nest,&quot; however, is even better than that fine film. The entire cast is excellent, but Nicholson is astonishing.

It has had accolades for everything -- plot, direction, filming, casting, acting. It deserves them all. It is nothing short of compulsive. The bad guy who has not lost his soul (much less his spirit) is pitted against the embodiment of sanctimonious righteousness who never had a soul to lose.I wonder whether Nicholson has even yet had full recognition for the truly great actor he is (how many people have even seen The King of Marvin Gardens, for instance?) His screen presence is enormous, magnetic and menacing. He combines outsize testosteronic individuality with the ability to get inside a character, and an electric sense of threat with a real power to tug at the heart-strings. Bad he may be, but unsympathetic never. He is a very big little guy, but he is still the little guy against the system. It must be impossible, surely, to upstage that?Incredibly, no. The ultimate star in a film that has no shortage of up-and-coming luminaries as well as Nicholson (D de Vito for one) is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. I am never going to forget that mask-like expressionless face and that ever-rational, implacable, ever-modulated voice mouthing those soulless, uncomprehending, the-system-is-right banalities. Above all, I am never going to forget that hair. Among the many touches of genius in this production, that hairstyle is the ultimate. I simply could not take my eyes off it. The name is effective too, and I shall continue to believe until someone proves me wrong that it was an inspired borrowing from Jane Eyre -- the dreadful and sadistic Miss Skatcherd brought up to date and given a 20th-century twist.This film is never going to become dated as long as these polarities continue to repel each other.

ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a cinematic triumph and a powerful allegory about the machinations of the Establishment, otherwise known as Authority.  In this film Authority is personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who calmly yet firmly intimidates and terrorizes her charges into submission.  And her charges?  None other than patients in a mental asylum, with most of them living there voluntarily, preferring Ratched's predictable and strict rules than taking their chances in the unpredictable outside world.  Accordingly, when Authority is challenged, and challenged effectively, first the other patients welcome the rebellion--and then Authority lashes back, and does whatever is needed to control and suppress the environment.  But there are consequences; at least one patient is influenced enough to strike out on his own, culminating in a euphoric victory over the status quo.Of course the challenge to Authority is none other than Randall Patrick McMurphy, a slick con faking insanity to avoid actual prison and hard labor.  This character is the glue that holds everything else together, and Jack Nicholson is stellar as McMurphy, playing him with a comedic edge that is captivating.  Yet the entire cast is exceptional--and utterly believable--from Fletcher to Christopher Lloyd to Brad Dourif to Danny DeVito to Will Sampson to the rest of the ensemble.  This movie doesn't feel like a movie--it feels like a documentary depicting a mental ward as it's manipulated by a nurse, then counter-manipulated by one man.  The inherent rebellion against rigid Authority is timeless, making ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST poignant and meaningful then, now, and forever.--D.

Not a hair is out of place in this fantastic adaptation of Ken Kesey's popular novel, and it's no accident that the movie won every major Academy Award for 1976. (Only two other films have swept the five major Oscars -- Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Screenplay -- &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot;) If you like dramas that examine human frailties and peculiarities, this movie is a must see. It will involve you with laughter, anger, dismay, angst, and elation. No cinematic work is perfect, but &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; comes pretty darned close.Jack Nicholson is in his defining role as &quot;Jack McMurphy&quot;; his persona is not only ideal for the part, but his acting is absolutely splendid. Nicholson is supported by a wonderful cast that includes the painfully unforgettable performance of Louise Fletcher as &quot;Nurse Ratched.&quot; Several then unknown actors -- Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito among them -- round out the troupe beautifully. The redoubtable director Milos Forman guides his band of exceptional actors through an excellent screenplay and into cinematic immortality.While this DVD's picture quality leaves much to be desired, it's somehow fitting for this film. Strangely, the documentary-like quality of the movie make the prevalent grain and foreign matter appear as though they belong! This is the only film I've yet seen that doesn't seem to lose much for want of a good print. Still, objectively speaking, Warner showed no respect to this classic by allowing such a poor copy on DVD -- and providing a mediocre transfer to boot.

When McMurphy discovers that almost all of the other ""crazies"" were there *voluntarily*, he can't believe it.  Why would anyone give up their power and freedom for the humiliation and abuse that Nurse Ratched dishes out?The asylum is not a physical prison-- it is easy enough to get in and out.  It is a mental prison, a prison of the mind.  The other characters are there because they believe they *need* to be there, that they are not normal because of the fears and insecurities that bind them.  Even the Chief, who is physically dominating, believes that he is powerless, until McMurphy comes along.This is the parable.  People who live with fear and insecurity, people who do not accept themselves for who they are, are living in their own mental prison.  As a result, they become powerless and victims of abuse.  Only when they start believing in themselves again, just as the Chief does, can they experience the freedom to soar with their own God-given powers.  ""I feel as big as a mountain.""

Having Jack Nicholson take on the role of McMurphy, a man who tries to get out his prison term by faking being crazy, was a brilliant move, as he epitomizes the snide, sarcastic, rebellious character. Also, there are exceptional jobs done by both Brad Doriff as Billie, one of the patients in the asylum, and Louise Fletcher as the soft spoken, but superior Nurse Ratched, who butts head with McMurphy. The film also features many well-known names and faces: Danny DeVito in his film debut, Christopher Lloyd, Will Sampson (as ""Chief"").The film's main theme is antiestablishment and rebellion over authority, but still there is a human side to all of the mischeviousness. McMurphy realizes almost immediately after getting to the institution that things won't go as merrily and easy as he had planned, but is confident that he will break Nurse Ratched's will within a week, so much so that he offers a wager with some of the patients. McMurphy tries to rally the boys to have special privileges and to do things like watch the world series, and the crux of the film is about this battle between individual and authority. Along the way, he meets and gets to know many of the wards, and sees their problems up close. He befriends a silent, towering Native American man, Chief, who becomes an important character in the film's final resolution.The film also explores what it means to be ""free."" Many of the wards, McMurphy comes to find out, do not have to be in the institution, but are there voluntarily, perhaps so they don't have to face the outside world. McMurphy's sense of freedom--which is to do and say whatever he wants-- is constantly being impeded and prevented by Nurse Ratched. In a critical point in the film, the Chief sees this freedom being crushed, and must decide what to do.I loved the two disc set, which also offers a documentary that looks at the making of the film, so this definitely is the one to get (I mention this because Amazon lumps all versions of the film together in one review).I remember seeing this movie back in a film studies class, and it was fantastic to watch it again.

99296,A2MF338Q12XI3H,0790732181,Frank Bierbrauer,"[1, 1]","One of the truly great films. Its always difficult to compare one movie with another because they are often judged by a different measure in each case. So I won't bother comparing with anything.This is the story of McMurphy a seeming career criminal full of cynicism and a boundless, reckless kind of energy for life and a disregard for authority. He enters the mental hospital because he is suspected of being psychologically disturbed and of course being the clever criminal he is chooses the &quot;loony bin&quot; rather than hard work on a prison farm. What strikes one immediately is the lack of sensitivity for others' feelings with regard to criminals, similarly we notice straight away the way nurse Pratchet controls her group of patients with an iron hand and a cold soul. The hospital corridors are empty and stark, the colours muted. The whole atmosphere is bleak. Milos Forman shows what he is capable of and gives a hint of his ability which he would later display in &quot;Amadeus&quot;. Jack Nicholsen simply dominates the film in conjunction with nurse Pratchet. Nicholsen is the ideal choice but as noted by another reviewer he makes the role so completely his own that its difficult to see it any other way including his representation in the book.As McMurphy shakes up the neat and tidy world constructed by the nurse he comes into more an more conflict with her especially after his &quot;outing&quot; with the other patients to the outside. One sees right away that these kinds of institutions, much like prisons, often don't help the recuperation of patients but rather make it more difficult for them to reorient themselves for the outside world. Hopefully these kinds of methods are now outdated and a more human perspective is applied.An outstanding film putting Jack Nicholsen on the map.",5,An outstanding film putting Jack Nicholsen on the map,975974400,"12 5, 2000",2000,1815,"['One', 'truly', 'great', 'films', 'always', 'difficult', 'compare', 'one', 'movie', 'are', 'often', 'judged', 'different', 'measure', 'case', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'comparing', 'anything.This', 'story', 'McMurphy', 'seeming', 'career', 'criminal', 'full', 'cynicism', 'boundless', 'reckless', 'kind', 'energy', 'life', 'disregard', 'authority', 'mental', 'hospital', 'suspected', 'being', 'psychologically', 'disturbed', 'course', 'being', 'clever', 'criminal', 'quot', 'bin', 'quot', 'rather', 'hard', 'work', 'prison', 'farm', 'What', 'one', 'immediately', 'lack', 'sensitivity', 'others', 'feelings', 'regard', 'criminals', 'similarly', 'notice', 'straight', 'away', 'way', 'nurse', 'Pratchet', 'group', 'patients', 'iron', 'hand', 'cold', 'soul', 'hospital', 'corridors', 'are', 'empty', 'stark', 'colours', 'muted', 'whole', 'atmosphere', 'bleak', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'what', 'capable', 'hint', 'ability', 'would', 'later', 'display', 'quot', 'Amadeus', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Nicholsen', 'simply', 'film', 'conjunction', 'nurse', 'Pratchet', 'Nicholsen', 'ideal', 'choice', 'noted', 'reviewer', 'role', 'so', 'completely', 'own', 'difficult', 'see', 'other', 'way', 'including', 'representation', 'book.As', 'McMurphy', 'up', 'neat', 'tidy', 'world', 'constructed', 'nurse', 'more', 'more', 'conflict', 'especially', 'quot', 'outing', 'quot', 'other', 'patients', 'outside', 'One', 'right', 'away', 'kinds', 'institutions', 'much', 'prisons', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'recuperation', 'patients', 'rather', 'make', 'more', 'difficult', 'reorient', 'outside', 'world', 'Hopefully', 'kinds', 'methods', 'are', 'now', 'outdated', 'more', 'human', 'perspective', 'applied.An', 'outstanding', 'film', 'putting', 'Jack', 'Nicholsen', 'map']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It's been 30 years but this film ages very well as its theme of power corrupting and the triumph of the human will over tyranny, injustice and downright evil intentions is still relevant today.  Add that to brilliant acting by Nicholson in his best ever performance in a role that seems to have been written just for him as well as by Fletcher who is so good in her role as Nurse Ratched (""Wretched"")that she ranks among the top 10 of all time villainesses or bitches you'd love to stick a knife into.  This movie serves as a great metaphor for the triumph of the underdog over absolute power given to those who abuse it.  It was literally shocking for me to see (no pun intended) just how medieval and cruel ""treatment"" of the insane was (and hopefully not still is) in the 60s.  Released at about the time of the end of the Vietnam war this film would have struck a chord with audiences of the time experiencing something similar in trying to overcome injustices of the powers that be as symbolised by Nixon in how absolute power almost inevitably leads to corruption and the suffering of the true innocents.  This powerful movie will always be among my all-time favourites.Unfortunately, this dvd version is very poor as the picture quality has many imperfections such as white spots having not been restored and barely rises above VHS quality.  The sound quality is also poor having not been remastered.  My advice is to give this version a miss and to wait for a well restored and remastered version with at least Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound options as well as good Special Features to surface either in the standard or in the new Blu-ray formats.  Surely a classic like this deserves a lot better than this poor quality dvd version.Updated 27 June 2011: 4 starsAmazon won't let me do a separate review for this and so I'll append this here: the digibook blu-ray version of this film is certainly worth the upgrade.  The picture quality while not pristine perfect is much, much better than the dvd version I reviewed above.  The iritating white spots and other film imperfections have been removed although grain does appear at a few points throughout the film but not overly so to complain too much about.  The sound quality is also a vast improvement over the dvd coming in Dolby HD 5.1 surround although truth be told most of the sound is heavily front loaded on the original master anyway and as this film is really mostly dialogue driven the lack of true surround is not too disturbing.  The digibook itself is very nice to behold and I do confess to having a fancy for digibook blu-ray releases like this because it makes it easier for those who already have the dvd to want to double-dip.Undeniably great film content, vastly improved picture and sound quality and very nice digibook release makes this blu-ray release a high recommendation.",2,"Shocking, Moving, Heartwarming, Powerful and One of the Best Ever!

I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. My reasons for choosing it were two-fold. One, I like Jack Nicholson, and 2, I remembered it as a highly acclaimed movie back in the 70s. The movie was excellent. Well worth watching!The movie had a real simple setting, and seemed like a stage play. About 3/4 of it took place in an Oregon mental hospital. In addition, there are a couple short excursions outside the hospital. Jack Nicholson was the only known star at the time of filming. That was a choice. All of the other actors (roughly 20 people) were unknowns who played mostly patients and administration people and support help in a mental hospital. The main set was an actual Oregon mental hospital and the actors portrayed people who they had met there and studied. The acting was excellent and gave the story an eery realism. It was one of those &#34;you-are-there&#34; types of movies.The movie was highly touted when it came out in the 70s. It was a time of reform of mental institutions and this movie brought a lot of attention to the situation. But, in addition the story (originally a play) was highly regarded and the realism and acting in the film resulted in five Academy Awards including Best Picture. Well, they were awards that you can look back on and say that they got it right. Everything about the picture is first rate. I was delighted to view it.Gary Peterson",5,Well Done!

99305,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,0790732181,Godly Gadfly,"[18, 26]","In this multi-Academy award winning flick based on Ken Kesey's novel, actor Jack Nicholson as jail-bird Randle P. McMurphy seeks escape from the prison work farm by feigning madness.  He is committed to a psychiatric ward for the mentally disturbed for evaluation while the staff try to determine whether his behaviour is genuine insanity or mere rebellion.  But being with the mentally ill isn't as rosy as McMurphy imagined it to be, particularly under the repressive regime operated by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).  In the battle of mind-games with Ratched, McMurphy discovers that even a simple thing as watching the World Series is impossible, because it might disturb the patients' routine.Only three movies have ever taken out all five major Academy awards (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay), and ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is one of that elite group.  To say that the acting is superb is an understatement.  It takes a lot of talent to convincingly portray someone mentally disturbed, but this cast accomplishes it with brilliance.  The supporting roles as nearly as terrific as the leading roles: Sydney Lassick as the shaky inarticulate Charlie Cheswick, Brad Dourif as the stuttering virgin Billy Bibbit, Danny DeVito as the infantile Martini, Christopher Lloyd as the wide-eyed trouble-maker Tabor, William Redfield as the eloquent intellectual Dale Harding, and Will Sampson as the mute Indian giant.But the mentally ill are depicted not merely as objects for examination and pity, but with genuine sympathy as victims under an oppressive regime.  Admittedly they're also the source for warm humor; Highlights include McMurphy's commentary of an imaginary baseball game with all the ""nuts"" cheering, and McMurphy's creative introduction of all patients as ""doctors"" from the mental institution as they hijack a fishing boat.  Those who work with the mentally disturbed in real life will be the first to tell you that you need a sense of humor in dealing with them.  But humor doesn't exclude compassion, and this movie raises serious questions about the treatment of the mentally ill.Everything is geared towards arousing sympathy for the mentally disturbed: minimalist music and silence, dreary colors, bright lighting, and male care-givers who are police-like unnamed uniforms.  These factors combine to create an atmosphere that conveys a clinical and sterile environment devoid of compassion for those who need it.  Nurse Ratched is depicted as a cold and distant woman without feelings for those in her charge, and her authoritarian role personifies an establishment that cares little for the mentally ill.  Rather than show compassion for the weak, she uses therapy sessions to uncover whatever hope and spirit they have and destroy it.  McMurphy's embodiment of this human spirit is somewhat exaggerated (the way he initiates interest in basketball games and escapes on a fishing expedition is not entirely plausible), but it makes the point.  Interestingly, some have seen the movie as a social criticism on all oppression of the human spirit, with a broad application even to ideologies like communism.  As others have said: tyranny has many faces, and the story of freedom from oppression goes beyond the walls of a mental asylum.The criticism of the handling of the mentally ill is most evident in how the institution handles McMurphy.  We identify with McMurphy because we know his insanity is faked, and yet the ""treatment"" he receives is thoroughly troubling, especially when those in charge resort to electric-shock therapy.  Is there a parallel in the way that many social problems (eg depression, ADD) are today diagnosed as mental illnesses and treated with drugs?  The tragic way in which McMurphy's ""mental illness"" is mishandled at the conclusion arouses righteous anger, and is a disturbing indictment on all mistreatment of the mentally ill.  There is no crowd-pleasing feel-good ending as his attempt to topple the establishment fails.  Yet the lack of a happy ending makes his criticisms of the establishment all the more piercing.The movie was rated R for frequent profanity/blasphemy, crude sexual talk and one violent scene at the end (there are also scenes involving alcohol, suicide, an incident where sexual promiscuity is applauded, and an implied endorsement of mercy killing).  The violence and language is deliberately distasteful and one can hardly feel sympathy for McMurphy as an immoral criminal (he is a convicted rapist, rebels against authority, sets up a gambling casino, and encourages Billy to lose his virginity).  Yet one has to feel sympathy for him as he is abused by an inhumane establishment that is equally criminal in its own way by failing to show genuine compassion for those entrusted in its care.  If McMurphy's character is distasteful and criminal, so is the character of care given to the mentally ill.  Rather than become sidetracked by McMurphy's failings, we need to take a serious look at the failings of the establishment as embodied in Ratched.  The tragic consequences (represented by Billy's death & McMurphy's lobotomy) of these failings are just as horrific as the consequences of an immoral life.  Understood in this way, this movie is much more than a vindication of the free human spirit and an endorsement of rebellious anti-authoritarianism.  More importantly it functions as a biting criticism against the abuse of authority to crush that spirit.  This is not a pleasant movie to watch, but it packs a powerful philosophical punch and raises profound questions that are more enduring than mere entertainment.The conclusion does offer a note of hope, as the silent Indian escapes the cuckoo's nest (perhaps a metaphor of true freedom being found in escaping the establishment and modern institutionalized civilization?).  But we are still left with disturbing questions about those who do not escape: Would we really want our family members in a place like this?  This is a disturbing movie that raises disturbing questions about the treatment of the disturbed - but questions that need to be asked ... and answered.",4,A disturbing movie about the

99306,A2SXGU7L6VLJ5P,0790732181,Gogol,"[4, 5]","This film will always have a an important place in film history but I think what has given it that place is 1. The topic of the film and 2. The sheer acting ability of Jack Nicholson.Nicholson here is a convicted criminal who fakes insanity to grab a reduced sentence sets about creating his own rules in a mental hospital.  Nicholson portrays something in us all, a free spirit confined and reduced to live by morals and codes he does not recognise if only to survive.  The film explores the disastrous effects of rebellion to those rules and how the desire for freedom if defeated in one can be ignited in another.The film explores how others can be so easily lead and also how easily they can be defeated (Such as when Nicholson arranges for a prostitute for one of the younger inmates and the party he sets up), how fear can instill obedience (Nicholson's punishments)  The film is remarkable in its limited use of sets and instead relies on Nicholson's remarkable acting ability.Nicholson is simply superb in this film.  His facial expression, his body movement say almost a thousand words more than his actual lines convey.  He is larger than life, eccentric and devious all the same.  At times you can relate to the character at others be pulling your hair out at his rash behavior.  That Nicholson can stir such emotion in a viewer is a testament to his acting ability.Probably the most powerful scene in the entire film is where Nicholson says to the others while pointing to a huge ceramic wash basin that is sealed into the ground ""I am going to rip that out, put it through the window and break out of here""  The other 'inmates' mock him and laugh amongst themselves (Probably thinking to themselves 'He is madder than we are') Nicholson begins to attempt to pull the basin out, he strains and strains and slowly the others begin to think ""Maybe he is going to do it"" When finally he gives up.

Here is a film that, for once, deserved every last Oscar is received.  Based on Ken  Kesey's wonderful but far more convoluted book, Cukoo's Nest stars Jack Nicolson as R.P. McMurphy, a living-large thrill seeker escaping jail time by acting crazy enough to instituted at a mental ward.There we meet a slew of comic performances by offbeat characters, and also the diabolical Nurse Ratched. Ratched runs the whole show with hard fist. I think we've all encountered someone like Nurse Ratched, whose rage and disapproval boil cold until an air of stifling compsure and  soft-spokenness, which is far more arresting than uncontrolled yelling.Her and McMurphy inevitably clash, and his reign of disorder inspires the other immates to speak up against the  injusticies of the ward.I suppose this is predominantly a &quot;man&quot; movie, with lots of  male bonding, male-oriented jokes, and a female protagonist. It's goofy nature and comedy lures us into a tragic and powerful tale of triumph, but the two don't clash one  bit.This new DVD edition provides an insightful second disc, and a commentary on the first, which despite its a large party of commentators, doesn't feel crowded. The film certainly doesn't look its 25 years, but the transfer is even more clear. The soundtrack allows us to hear every background groan and rant in detail, and the comedic chaos is rendered comprehensible.One Flew Over the Cukoo's nest is truly a wonderful film, one of the best of all time.

Apparently it managed to sweep all five major Academy Awards in 1975 (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay) and was very well deserved.A crook manages to get off a work farm and sent to a mental institution for evaluation. R.P. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson endeavors to shake things up around the ward and show the men there that they aren't nearly as crazy as they think they are. Some of his shananigans include gambling, watching a fake world series game, hi-jacking a bus with inmates on it to go fishing, and sneaking girls and booze into the ward at night. When he discovers that antagonizing Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, could get him committed and only permit him to leave on her time instead of his own, he decides to plan an escape. The constant battle for control on the ward is very entertaining and at times heart breaking.Jack Nicholson's energy and improvised antics never fail to entertain and engage your attention throughout. When he isn't performing for the others, he manages to be quite an sympathetic fellow trying to better the lives of people around him through his crude techniques. The Nurse is amazingly calm, strict, and has a never-ending tact for digging to the core of the patients' defenses to maintain control and keep them miserably docile. She rarely raises her voice and yet it's obvious she doesn't need to in order to get people to listen to her.The supporting cast is also amazing featuring Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd among others. They deviate back and forth from being vacant, hysterical, and occasionally have sane moments that make them very human. In particular, the Chief (Will Sampson) who has convinced everyone that he is deaf and dumb goes on a journey back to communication and the real world with McMurphy's help. The ending is happy and tragic all at the same time, but I won't say why for those of you who haven't gotten to view it yet. I very highly recommend it, and this DVD is a great edition.DVD Extras:The restored picture really makes a big difference in viewing. The Behind-the-Scenes documentary is very interesting talking about the time period, the themes from the book, the casting, and the time members of the crew spent at a similar facility to prepare for their roles and how they refused to drop character during the shoot. The Cast/Director Career Highlights don't give you much more information than if you used IMDB, but the audio commentary by the director is again very interesting, though the documentary is better.",5,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - sweeper of awards,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,2701,"['So', 'watched', 'gem', 'two-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'last', 'night', 'loved', 'more', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'probably', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'Apparently', 'managed', 'sweep', 'five', 'major', 'Academy', 'Awards', '1975', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'deserved.A', 'crook', 'manages', 'get', 'off', 'work', 'farm', 'sent', 'mental', 'institution', 'evaluation', 'R.P', 'McMurphy', 'played', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'endeavors', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'ward', 'show', 'men', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'crazy', 'think', 'are', 'shananigans', 'include', 'gambling', 'watching', 'fake', 'world', 'series', 'game', 'hi-jacking', 'bus', 'inmates', 'go', 'fishing', 'sneaking', 'girls', 'booze', 'ward', 'night', 'When', 'antagonizing', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'played', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'could', 'get', 'committed', 'only', 'permit', 'leave', 'time', 'instead', 'own', 'plan', 'escape', 'constant', 'battle', 'control', 'ward', 'very', 'entertaining', 'times', 'heart', 'breaking.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'energy', 'improvised', 'antics', 'never', 'fail', 'entertain', 'engage', 'attention', 'When', ""n't"", 'performing', 'others', 'be', 'quite', 'sympathetic', 'fellow', 'trying', 'better', 'lives', 'people', 'crude', 'techniques', 'Nurse', 'amazingly', 'calm', 'strict', 'never-ending', 'tact', 'digging', 'core', 'patients', 'defenses', 'maintain', 'control', 'keep', 'miserably', 'docile', 'rarely', 'voice', 'yet', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'need', 'order', 'get', 'people', 'listen', 'her.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'amazing', 'featuring', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'others', 'deviate', 'back', 'forth', 'being', 'vacant', 'hysterical', 'occasionally', 'have', 'sane', 'moments', 'make', 'very', 'human', 'particular', 'Chief', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'who', 'convinced', 'everyone', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'journey', 'back', 'communication', 'real', 'world', 'McMurphy', 'help', 'ending', 'happy', 'tragic', 'same', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'why', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'view', 'yet', 'very', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'great', 'edition.DVD', 'Extras', 'restored', 'picture', 'really', 'big', 'difference', 'viewing', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'documentary', 'very', 'interesting', 'talking', 'time', 'period', 'themes', 'book', 'casting', 'time', 'members', 'crew', 'spent', 'similar', 'facility', 'prepare', 'roles', 'how', 'refused', 'drop', 'character', 'shoot', 'Cast/Director', 'Career', 'Highlights', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'more', 'information', 'used', 'IMDB', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'again', 'very', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'better']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

99318,A457S8SW690NM,0790732181,hi,"[0, 0]","First off, the acting in this movie is amazing. Jack Nicholson gives the best performance of his life and is simply unbelievable. His performance is in my opinion one of the best ever. Sydney Lassick delivers also an extraordinary performance as Charlie Cheswick. On the other hand, I didn't find Louise Fletcher to do that good of a job. I found her performance to be way overrated and found it to be fairly descent but definitely not worthy of best actress.Now to the movie. Beware if you are sensitive, the movie is very sad and depressing. You'll probably cry at the awful treatment that you see. I found myself cussing at the TV and screaming at nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). I mean, I hated her. I was screaming at her nonstop. She was so awful to everyone. This mental institution is so awful that it is probably making everyone there a lot more crazy than they were. Jack Nicholson is McMurphy, a guy who fakes insanity to get out of prison. He is therefore sent to a mental institution. There, he is the leader. He befriends everyone and is their leader. They love him and he loves them. But, Nurse Ratched and her goons stand in his way to freedom and won't even let them watch the world series. The movie is very sad and touching and the ending is at first terribly depressing and then there is a joyous occasion. The electroshocking of the patients is awful and made me feel like wanting to strike back against this. You'll hate the goons and that stupid nurse Ratched. The movie is haunting and I was so into it that I would be cheering for the patients, laughing with them, crying with them, and hurling insults at nurse Ratched. I was so into it that I'd be like: ""You stupid bit**!!! Just let them watch the World Seires! Come on!"" I got very emotionally into it and connected with all of the patients. This movie is a haunting journey and the treatment in this institution is criminal and is making all of the patients insane or more insane than they were.

And from that dark place he will find his bliss when he becomes a leader and stimulates his companions to develop an awakening spirit of self worth and  rebelliousness  against the rules which configure the Status Quo in the hospital . The image can not be more descriptive .Curiously? an European film maker specifically Czech who really understood what the slender and the cruelness invasion meant for the free and untamed  western spirit derived from his emotional memories in 1968 : Milos Foreman who played hard and without making too much concessions practiced and incisive surgeon to the social body conceived such as micro cosmos in itself through the pretext of using a mental institution.This attitude will represent for him the beginning of his end when Louise Fletcher the implacable nurse guess his game . She will detect he is normal but ... she has the power to avoid he abandons this sinister jail .

99320,AH1M9A3JTV7C3,0790732181,Ian Muldoon,"[5, 6]","There are some great cinema moments in this legendary film set in a Mental &quot;Health&quot; insitution in a time when the frequent use of invasive surgery and electroshock therapy  was used to &quot;cure&quot;the &quot;abnormal&quot;, for which read irritable, rebellious, eccentric, even just different.  One such moment occurs when inmates McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and The Chief (Will Sampson) sit beside each other waiting their turn for some electroshock therapy after they had  &quot;misbehaved&quot; .  McMurphy hands The Chief a piece of gum and The Chief responds by taking the gum and murmuring &quot;Thank you&quot;.  These two words shock Murphy and are a revelation to him.  It was a view held by staff and inmates alike that The Chief was mute.  McMurphy, considering himself smarter than just about everybody, has also been fooled.  The revelation to McMurphy is that The Chief has &quot;beaten&quot; the system.  It is a moment of pure joy, both for McMurphy and the viewer.  In another scene, extravert McMurphy(at about five feet six inchesin height) suggests to the introvert Chief (at about six feet six in height) that they break out of the institution and The Chief  replies &quot; I'm not as big as you&quot;.

99321,AMF5LHI9IOIH1,0790732181,Irishgirl,"[8, 10]","This is a classic film that won the award for best picture in 1975. That shouldn't be a surprise given the all-star cast and an unbelievable script. If you have not seen this movie before, I strongly recommend it. I first saw this film when I was in high school. I was reading the book and needed to give a report on it, so I decided watching the movie would make it easier. I love the movie. But for those new to this movie, you also need to prepare to be very disturbed. ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is several things: very intriguing, haunting, humorous, disturbing and touching. My mom refuses to watch this movie because it bothers her too much, but this is a movie I can watch again and again.The acting in this movie is absolutely superb! The amazing lineup of actors show us their incredible ability to become their characters and make us believe they are actually ""crazy."" We start with an old veteran; Jack Nicholson, the novice of disturbing roles. With those conniving eyes and huge mad grin, who could play the role of R.P. McMurphy better?McMurphy is an inmate charged with statutory rape, who basically gets tired of life behind bars and will do anything for a little vacation, even if that means a trip to the funny farm. McMurphy is a master manipulator, and due to his actions in prison, McMurphy was taken to the mental institution to ""determine if he's mentally ill."" Although the authorities suspect that he is faking everything, McMurphy denies it.McMurphy is instantly entered into a world of pill-popping, poker-playing, unstable therapy-needers, who are surrounded by elevator music, courtesy of Nurse Ratched. It is then that we get to see all these patients and their incredible personalities.The Chief: A huge soft-spoken Native American who has everybody thinking he is really ""deaf and dumb."" McMurphy actually befriends the Chief, teaching him to play basketball and recruiting him for escape help. They become friends and decide to plan an escape together later on.Billy Bibbett: Billy is my favorite character and Brad Dourif plays him exceptionally well in his film debut. Wild-eyed lady-lover Billy is a young man who has a relentless stuttering problem and a tendency to want to commit suicide. His sweet innocence coupled with his mental situations make him a very interesting individual.Martini: Danny DeVito was just as short then as he is now. DeVito plays the squinty-eyed Martini who has an uncanny knack for being repetitive with words and actions.Harding: Played by William Redfield, Harding is the ""intelligent"" one of the bunch who is coping with his suspicions about his wife being attractive to other men in his eyes. Some of the patients, especially Taber, enjoy pushing his buttons.Taber: We all know Christopher Lloyd from the ""Back To The Future"" and ""The Addams Family"" series. Lloyd was perfectly cast for the role as Taber, with his wide, bugged-out eyes and very loud voice. Taber picks on those who he thinks are full of bull s**** but otherwise, he just goes with the flow.Cheswick: Another one of my favorite characters. Sensitive follower Charlie Cheswick played fantastically by Sydney Lassick, becomes the first patient other than McMurphy to stand up to Nurse Ratched with how he feels, only to end up in line for shock treatment.Finally, there is the dreaded Nurse Ratched. Played by Louise Fletcher in a very convincing performance. Seemingly sweet and soft-spoken Nurse Ratched basically has all the patients wrapped around her finger and under her thumb. In a calmly and coolly manipulative style, Ratched is adamant about keeping the patients at bay with her ""carefully planned schedule.""There are many more wonderful characters as well including Banchini (aka ""I'm tired""), Mr. Fredrickson (You all remember Vincent as Mr. Fargas in ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" and as the Subway Ghost in ""Ghost"") and his ""sidekick"" Jimmy. Then there's the ""Colonel"" with the wide intense eyes, who enjoys mumbling to himself. You'll also see the late great Scatman Crothers as Mr. Turkle, the night monitor whom McMurphy pays with cash and women in exchange for his silence so everyone can have a party.Once McMurphy enters the ward, he gets a first hand look at the lives of the patients and realizes that taking a vacation in a mental ward with the likes of Nurse Ratched around is no picnic in the park. Nurse Ratched does indeed have a carefully planned schedule; a schedule to basically dictate what the patients can and cannot do, and only help them according to her standards. Her idea of helping the patients is to play loud boring music, conduct the therapy sessions as if she is a grade school teacher looking down at her students, and refuse to listen to ideas that could REALLY make the patients feel better. It's almost as if she, in her quiet manipulative way, wants to keep the patients ""shrunk down to size"" and feeling like they are small people who need to look up to someone smarter that knows what's best for them. In reality, if you treat people like they are ""small"" than they will feel that way and feel like they have no choice but to do whatever she says. This is the game that Ratched plays with the patients. Nobody bothers to take a stand about what they feel should be done; at least not until R.P. McMurphy comes around and shows them that they are no different than others and that they have a right to have an opinion. That's what makes this film so unique. Here we have a criminal in McMurphy, who knows better than Nurse Ratched about how to work with the patients. Nurse Ratched fails to heed to the fact that there are different kinds of therapy for everybody.So who is REALLY the crazy one here? Is it the group of ""mental defectives,"" or is it the nurse who makes their mental states worse? Let's examine this for a moment: one of the most memorable scenes is when McMurphy confronts Ratched about changing the daily schedule so they can watch the World Series. Knowing that most of the patients are under her thumb (with the rest being too severely out there to know the difference), she agrees to hold a vote. Nine people must vote. It is then that McMurphy realizes just how much power Ratched has over the patients. Only a couple raises their hands to vote despite McMurphy's encouragement. In fact, some of the patients look downright scared to vote. What does that tell you?But it is R.P. McMurphy's way of treating the patients; his jokes, his encouraging words, and overall respect of them being humans like everyone else (only with a few problems), that inspires some of the patients to take a stand and speak up about what they feel. But Ratched's smooth manipulative mode is quick to turn back on again. Let's examine another memorable scenario: Take the ultra sensitive Mr. Cheswick. Normally one who would never have made any comments, Cheswick inquires about what McMurphy had mentioned about the World Series. He tells Nurse Ratched ""I've never been to a baseball game and I think I'd like to see one. That could be good therapy too wouldn't it Ms. Ratched?"" Now why in the world would Nurse Ratched want to give up her powerful routine because of someone else's opinion and wishes, even if it could help that person? No, her power is more important than helping others. After another vote is held, there are nine patients who vote this time thanks to McMurphy's influence on them. Nine votes. That was the maximum they needed right? Wrong! Now Nurse Ratched decides that the severely mentally impaired people need to count as well (and she knows darn well that they do not have the capacity to vote let alone tie their own shoes). But McMurphy is determined and desperately goes around to the other patients trying to get just one of them to vote. Who gets in a vote? Why it's' none other than the so-called ""deaf and dumb"" Chief! But even that is not enough. ""The vote was closed,"" Ratched tells McMurphy and promptly turns the elevator music on.So you can clearly see how this institution operates. Everything is controlled by Ratched's iron fist and she manipulates these mentally unstable people to act out in unstable ways and that in turn leads them to the shock treatment room; a place none of them likes to go. It is almost like punishment for wanting something done fair, because really, when these patients act out in their crazy ways, it is over subjects that are completely normal. Like when Cheswick inquires about his cigarettes and why he cannot have them: ""I ain't no little kid!"" he yells, ""What gives you the right to dish out the cigarettes any time you feel like it huh? ""I want something done!"" Is that not a normal thing to want? Is it not normal for a grown man like Cheswick to want to be treated like an adult and not a child? Isn't it normal for people like Cheswick to want their cigarettes? Let him have his cigarettes. Maybe it's a comfort for someone who is unstable. But no, instead, Ratched continues her degrading treatment by yelling at Cheswick to ""sit down,"" and when he doesn't, he is taken for his shock treatment. So Ratched deprives these people of respect by treating them like children, deprives them of their willingness to speak out (until McMurphy came around), and also deprives them of getting involved in things that they may like to do to make them feel more at ease and more sane. Ratched just basically keeps these people insane with her crude manipulative personality. This in turn creates friction and this in turn makes them seem like they're acting crazy when really all they want is some real respect and some therapy that works for them.Nurse Ratched's way of treating the patients makes McMurphy crazy. You can see that even a criminal would know how to better care for the mental health of the patients than Ratched does. McMurphy gives the patients royal treatment from hijacking a bus and taking them on a fishing trip, to betting with them in poker, to playing basketball with them, to giving them a fantastic night time party with booze, women, dancing and music. The party was supposed to be a last hurrah before McMurphy took off on his escape, but when morning came and Ratched found the rooms in squander, all hell broke loose. Young stutterer, Billy Bibbitt,  who for a moment DOES NOT stutter anymore (due to his new sense of self that McMurphy helped him get most likely) commits a terrible act upon himself after trying to explain to Nurse Ratched the situation he was in with a woman (and by the way, Ratched treated Billy terribly in this part; as if he was a bad little boy who had done something wrong). The ending is one of the most disturbing parts of the film. Let's just say that McMurphy is more than a little relaxed after shock treatment and that he escapes with the Chief in a way you may not have imagined. Even with a sore neck, in the end, I'm sure Ratched was pleased. After all, it was McMurphy who came in and tried to give the patients freedom, fun and overall good therapy; something she would not do. With McMurphy out of the picture, she could continue her charade.There is something to be said for heroes that come in the most un-likely forms. In this case it came in the form of a criminal. A criminal who believed what Ratched was doing to himself and the patients was criminal and fought to the end to help the patients find themselves. There is also something to be said for how far one will go to keep power and authority, and this could include a nurse keeping mentally ill patients mentally ill by depriving them and treating them as low, small people. Ratched was willing to go to any length, but so was McMurphy. What an odd pair they make.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why this film won the Oscar in 1975 for Best Picture. This DVD also includes a description of the making of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" as well as cast biographies. It may not be one of those clich&eacute; ""happily-ever-after"" films but it's one of the most unique movies around and you're sure to love the mixture of humor and insanity that makes this film special. I highly recommend this film and hope you'll watch it as much as I do.",5,"""A Rigged Game""",1125273600,"08 29, 2005",2005,12150,"['classic', 'film', 'won', 'award', 'best', 'picture', '1975',

Nurse Ratched is the most radical case. In the book  she's far more complex, because we're given a window into her conscience.  That wouldn't have been impossible to do on film, but instead we're given a  Ratched here who -- as other reviewers have mentioned -- becomes a sort of  evil incarnate. Either you view her that way, or you end up wondering what  the heck is motivating her. In the absence of some reasonable explanation  for why she's doing what she is, Nicholson becomes the good guy and she's  the bad guy, and the movie loses the central questions asked in the  book.Count me among those who think this is a decent, but overrated,  film.

The film is great in itself to show how psychiatric hospitals are prisons, even voluntary prisons, when patients are made to believe that they are not ready to leave and go back home. It is also great to show how the patients become dependent on the hospital, the medication, the treatment and the personnel by being deprived of all control over their life or lives. They cannot decide anything, even by voting, even by having a majority in that vote. The personnel is ready to make the beds and the chairs vote in order for the patients not to have a majority. Even the simple things like cigarettes, television, card games or even taking a nap at will are denied or rationed to the patients and they become at least social vegetables, and at times physical vegetables. Jack Nicholson arrives in there as a tornado and creates havoc. He is absolutely perfect for the part, maybe because he plays a part he knows perfectly well, or maybe even because he plays his own personal part. And of course the system defends itself, lobotomizes Jack Nicholson and everything goes back to normal.But the film is a metaphor of America, because only one will escape this hell : the Indian, who made everyone believe he was deaf and dumb. Indians are reduced to silence. But he escapes because he is stronger than anyone else, which means that he stayed because his world had disappeared, because his civilization had been destroyed. But he escapes and runs away across the countryside at dawn. This is in itself the central metaphor of the film : to be free you have to escape this society. To be free an Indian has to escape this white prison. But he escapes into a vast prairie, the vast prairie, and he runs away into that prairie in some surreal light : this is of course a metaphor of death and paradise for Indians. Hence there is no escape except into accepting imprisonment and being locked up in silence, or into death and eternal life that is nothing else but death after all.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX",5,The Indian cuckoo flies away from the rat nest,992304000,"06 12, 2001",2001,2085,"['are', 'expecting', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'have', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'film', 'great', 'show', 'how', 'psychiatric', 'hospitals', 'are', 'prisons', 'even', 'voluntary', 'prisons', 'when', 'patients', 'are', 'made', 'believe', 'are', 'not', 'ready', 'leave', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'also', 'great', 'show', 'how', 'patients', 'become', 'dependent', 'hospital', 'medication', 'treatment', 'personnel', 'being', 'deprived', 'control', 'life', 'lives', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'anything', 'even', 'voting', 'even', 'having', 'majority', 'vote', 'personnel', 'ready', 'make', 'beds', 'chairs', 'vote', 'order', 'patients', 'not', 'have', 'majority', 'Even', 'simple', 'things', 'cigarettes', 'television', 'card', 'games', 'even', 'taking', 'nap', 'will', 'are', 'denied', 'rationed', 'patients', 'become', 'least', 'social', 'vegetables', 'times', 'physical', 'vegetables', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'tornado', 'havoc', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'part', 'maybe', 'part', 'perfectly', 'well', 'maybe', 'even', 'own', 'personal', 'part', 'course', 'system', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'everything', 'back', 'normal.But', 'film', 'metaphor', 'America', 'only', 'one', 'will', 'escape', 'hell', 'Indian', 'who', 'made', 'everyone', 'believe', 'was', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'Indians', 'are', 'reduced', 'silence', 'stronger', 'anyone', 'else', 'stayed', 'world', 'had', 'disappeared', 'civilization', 'had', 'been', 'destroyed', 'away', 'countryside', 'dawn', 'central', 'metaphor', 'film', 'be', 'free', 'have', 'escape', 'society', 'be', 'free', 'Indian', 'escape', 'white', 'prison', 'vast', 'prairie', 'vast', 'prairie', 'away', 'prairie', 'surreal', 'light', 'course', 'metaphor', 'death', 'paradise', 'Indians', 'Hence', 'escape', 'accepting', 'imprisonment', 'being', 'locked', 'up', 'silence', 'death', 'eternal', 'life', 'nothing', 'else', 'death', 'all.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'Paris', 'Universities', 'II', 'IX']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Mixing mental health with humor is a tough brand to sell; come to fine out it took several years for this movie to be made. Kirk Douglas had bought the rights hoping to star in it himself, but struggled to find a studio who would produce it; his son Michael eventually did it, but had the foresight to stay off the screen. When you watch it, it's not hard to work out why no-one would touch it - it's subject matter was just too quirky and controversial for Hollywood in the 60s. The film was ideal for representing a burgeoning discontent with society during the post-Vietnam malaise; its audience, like its characters, was feeling enormous dissatisfaction with rules, authority, government and the stupefying way it was treating its people. No wonder that it struck such a chord with cinema-goers.Many liberties that we take for granted are explored within the narrative of the film: communication (in therapy sessions, where the nurse leads the discussion) freedom (during the 'escape') alcohol (during the party) sex (Billy's turn with the hooker McMurphy imports). The reactions of Nurse Ratched and the orderlies symbolize the reactions of authority when we digress from its designated path; the response of the inmates is to return to the routines and drudgery they entail. The analogy with the restrictive nature of society is glaring.Enter Randle McMurphy, no respecter of rules or routines, a man who is riotous but also unselfish. Brilliantly played by Jack Nicholson (a masterly piece of casting) McMurphy challenges the established norms and routines of the hospital in pursuit of fun, which irks and then aggravates Nurse Ratched. The positive impact on the other patients is clear and noticeable; it suggests that there is value in breaking away from social expectations, in being spontaneous, in occasionally pursuing personal pleasure or individual goals beyond those authority grants to you. The conclusion suggests that those in authority will do anything to silence those who challenge the social order, but that freedom *is* ultimately accessible, whether by death (McMurphy) or escape (Chief Bromden).Social analysis aside, the movie is great fun: there are a lot of laughs, a lot of thought-provoking moments, and a few tears. It's certainly one of the finest moments in cinematic history - it came at a time when it was drastically needed by the viewing public, but its content and themes are no less relevant and interesting to us today.",5,Worthy of its rating,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,2578,"['been', 'buzzing', 'ears', 'friends', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'Mixing', 'mental', 'health', 'humor', 'tough', 'brand', 'sell', 'come', 'fine', 'took', 'several', 'years', 'movie', 'be', 'made', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'had', 'bought', 'rights', 'hoping', 'star', 'struggled', 'find', 'studio', 'who', 'would', 'produce', 'son', 'Michael', 'eventually', 'did', 'had', 'foresight', 'stay', 'screen', 'When', 'watch', 'not', 'hard', 'work', 'out', 'why', 'no-one', 'would', 'touch', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'quirky', 'controversial', 'Hollywood', '60s', 'film', 'was', 'ideal', 'representing', 'burgeoning', 'discontent', 'society', 'post-Vietnam', 'malaise', 'audience', 'characters', 'was', 'feeling', 'enormous', 'dissatisfaction', 'rules', 'authority', 'government', 'stupefying', 'way', 'was', 'treating', 'people', 'wonder', 'struck', 'such', 'chord', 'cinema-goers.Many', 'liberties', 'take', 'granted', 'are', 'explored', 'narrative', 'film', 'communication', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'where', 'nurse', 'discussion', 'freedom', ""'escape"", 'alcohol', 'party', 'sex', 'Billy', 'turn', 'hooker', 'McMurphy', 'imports', 'reactions', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'orderlies', 'symbolize', 'reactions', 'authority', 'when', 'digress', 'designated', 'path', 'response', 'inmates', 'return', 'routines', 'drudgery', 'entail', 'analogy', 'restrictive', 'nature', 'society', 'glaring.Enter', 'Randle', 'McMurphy', 'respecter', 'rules', 'routines', 'man', 'who', 'riotous', 'also', 'unselfish', 'Brilliantly', 'played', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'masterly', 'piece', 'casting', 'McMurphy', 'established', 'norms', 'routines', 'hospital', 'pursuit', 'fun', 'then', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'positive', 'impact', 'other', 'patients', 'clear', 'noticeable', 'value', 'breaking', 'away', 'social', 'expectations', 'being', 'spontaneous', 'occasionally', 'pursuing', 'personal', 'pleasure', 'individual', 'goals', 'authority', 'grants', 'conclusion', 'authority', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'silence', 'who', 'challenge', 'social', 'order', 'freedom', '*is*', 'ultimately', 'accessible', 'death', 'McMurphy', 'escape', 'Chief', 'Bromden', '.Social', 'analysis', 'aside', 'movie', 'great', 'fun', 'are', 'lot', 'laughs', 'lot', 'thought-provoking', 'moments', 'few', 'tears', 'certainly', 'one', 'finest', 'moments', 'cinematic', 'history', 'came', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'drastically', 'needed', 'viewing', 'public', 'content', 'themes', 'are', 'less', 'relevant', 'interesting', 'today']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Many scenes are sad,tragic and disturbing and the battles waged by Nicholson's McMurphy role are often Quixotic and frustrating. In the end, I came out of this film with feelings of strength and power, as well as an understanding of authority and free will that I challenge and examine to this day.McMurphy(Nicholson) is hardly a character anyone would like personally, forgiving maybe a quick conversation at a bar or a jobsite. McMurphy is jovial and quick with good natured BS, but is a petty crook, drinker, gambler and habitual loser. Sent from a prison work camp to a sanitarium for a brief evaluation, McMurphy locks heads witht the best player of the film, Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched. Methodical, calibrated and passive-aggressive, Nurse Ratched has made her the patients in her small therapy group obedient and broken their wills with a authoritarianism that is subtle and difficult to recognize. As the patients take their daily medication and ponder the hopelessness of their situations, Nurse Ratched coldly humilates her patients with her carefully regulated verbal tone and personality-free interactions.The therapy group are some of the saddest men you'll see on film- their existense pointless and their therapy for the most part unproductive. McMurphy's arrival in the psych ward to these men is like a breath of Spring air. McMurphy challenges first the protocol of the unofficial leaders of the patients, the ""just-a-job-man"" orderlies that are quick to use unecessary force, and eventually the whole thought process and the psychological lack of liberty and thought pushed by Ratcheds policies.Many saw this film in the 70's as a typical ""us against the Man"" screed, there's much more here. There are undertones that can appeal to many real life scenarios- the rituals of life we never question, our willingness to be lead instead of lead ourselves in times of question.

99340,A3OD7GOXPSO9Z,0790732181,JLR,"[0, 0]","There are not a lot of movies that look as good today as they did back in the 1970's. Many movies that have centered on ""youth culture"" and rebellion - ""Easy Rider"", ""Five Easy Pieces"", ""Two-Lane Blacktop"", ""Billy Jack"" - have become dated and will be seen by today's eyes as unusual. But ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" stands out because it took the rebellious spirit of youth and merged them together with themes of courage, stubbornness, idealism, pride, inspiration, oppression, potency and friendship, themes considered cliche in the 1970's, to make a movie that has stood the test of time. Brilliantly directed by the underrated Milos Forman, ""Cuckoo's Nest"" pits wise-ass rebel Randle P. McMurphy against the oppressive Nurse Ratched in a psychological, emotional and eventual physical battle in a mental hospital.Alternatively comical, tragic and life-affirming, ""Cuckoo's Nest"" can be read as many things---the battle of idealism against tyranny; an allegory of hippies against Nixon-era figures; a clash between warm, loose sentiment against cold, unemotional intellect; and a Freudian comedy of humane potency against mechanical flaw. But whatever the interpretation, ""Cuckoo's Nest"" remains an uncommonly powerful cinematic experience that stimulates the mind and touches the heart. With Haskell Wexler as the cinematographer, Forman turns the mental institution into a repressive cage of cuckoos that are never set free: the claustrophobic corridors, dead atmosphere, square-shaped windows and cells and eerie use of pleasant classical music makes it even more palpable.The performances are generally excellent, from the obligatory Jack Nicholson as Randle McMurphy to Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif and Danny Devito as the mental patients that McMurphy inspires. Louise Fletcher is a walking brick wall as Nurse Ratched, whose subtle but menacing methods on her patients prove that villains don't need to make world domination speeches and kill puppies to be evil. Forman has a good eye for detail and an exceptional skill for actors, as demonstrated here and in ""Amadeus"" and ""The Fireman's Ball"" and it is unfortunate that his talents are no recognized. My guess is that through the passage of time, his movies and talents will become standards that movies and film directors will be judged against.Speaking of Jack Nicholson, if there was one movie that turned him into a larger-than-life figure, it would be ""Cuckoo's Nest"". Nicholson was a struggling actor who achieved respectability with his dramatic roles in ""Five Easy Pieces"" and ""Chinatown"". But he also had a flair for comedy, as seen in ""Easy Rider"", the chicken salad sequence in ""Five Easy Pieces"" and, of course, the comedy classic ""The Last Detail"". With Randle McMurphy, Nicholson completely fulfilled his promise as a great actor in the making, expressing his talents in portraying both wild (and subtle) comedy and dramatic bravado. Rather he's angering Nurse Ratched by imagining that he is watching TV, taking his fellow patients out fishing on a boat or gradually revealing his rage when Ratched leads one of the patients to kill himself, Nicholson is a force on screen. Even if Nicholson never made movies afterwards, ""Cuckoo's Nest"" would still confirm his status as one of the greatest actors of all time.Perhaps it was wise that Forman made many changes from the original source material. Ken Kesey, who wrote the original 1962 novel, resented the movie because it gave the narration to Randle McMurphy instead of Chief Bromden. I have read the book many times during my high school years and while the novel is intriguing to read, the film adaptation is a lot smoother, less didactic and completely free from the emotional detachment and dense symbolism that marred the book (ex. the Combine and the portion where suddenly we find out that Randle already knew that Bromden was feigning his deafness). When you adapt a novel into the film, you've got to compress details and make changes, but as long as it respects the spirit of the book, the movie will turn out fine. And ""Cuckoo's Nest"" not only turned out fine, but the film adaptation is now considerably more well-known than the book version. Maybe Kesey does have a right to be mad after all.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is truly one of American cinema's greatest treasures. And the Blu-Ray version will ensure its immortality for many generations to come.Strongest recommendation to buy at all costs.",5,"A monumental classic that will go on, while other movies of its time are forgotten",1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,4457,"['are', 'not', 'lot', 'movies', 'look', 'good', 'today', 'did', 'back', '1970', 'Many', 'movies', 'have', 'centered', 'youth', 'culture', 'rebellion', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'Five', 'Easy', 'Pieces', 'Two-Lane', 'Blacktop', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'have', 'become', 'dated', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'today', 'eyes', 'unusual', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'out', 'took', 'rebellious', 'spirit', 'youth', 'merged', 'together', 'themes', 'courage', 'stubbornness', 'idealism', 'pride', 'inspiration', 'oppression', 'potency', 'friendship', 'themes', 'considered', 'cliche', '1970', 'make', 'movie', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'Brilliantly', 'directed', 'underrated', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'wise-ass', 'rebel', 'Randle', 'P.', 'McMurphy', 'oppressive', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'eventual', 'physical', 'battle', 'mental', 'hospital.Alternatively', 'comical', 'tragic', 'life-affirming', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'many', 'things', '-the', 'battle', 'idealism', 'tyranny', 'allegory', 'hippies', 'Nixon-era', 'figures', 'clash', 'warm', 'loose', 'sentiment', 'cold', 'unemotional', 'intellect', 'Freudian', 'comedy', 'humane', 'potency', 'mechanical', 'flaw', 'whatever', 'interpretation', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'uncommonly', 'powerful', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'mind', 'heart', 'Haskell', 'Wexler', 'cinematographer', 'Forman', 'mental', 'institution', 'repressive', 'cage', 'cuckoos', 'are', 'never', 'set', 'free', 'claustrophobic', 'corridors', 'dead', 'atmosphere', 'square-shaped', 'windows', 'cells', 'eerie', 'use', 'pleasant', 'classical', 'music', 'even', 'more', 'palpable.The', 'performances', 'are', 'generally', 'excellent', 'obligatory', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Randle', 'McMurphy', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'mental', 'patients', 'McMurphy', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'walking', 'brick', 'wall', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'subtle', 'menacing', 'methods', 'patients', 'prove', 'villains', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'make', 'world', 'domination', 'speeches', 'kill', 'puppies', 'be', 'evil', 'Forman', 'good', 'eye', 'detail', 'exceptional', 'skill', 'actors', 'demonstrated', 'here', 'Amadeus', 'Fireman', 'Ball', 'unfortunate', 'talents', 'are', 'recognized', 'guess', 'passage', 'time', 'movies', 'talents', 'will', 'become', 'standards', 'movies', 'film', 'directors', 'will', 'be', 'judged', 'against.Speaking', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'one', 'movie', 'turned', 'larger-than-life', 'figure', 'would', 'be', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'struggling', 'actor', 'who', 'achieved', 'respectability', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'Five', 'Easy', 'Pieces', 'Chinatown', 'also', 'had', 'flair', 'comedy', 'seen', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'chicken', 'salad', 'sequence', 'Five', 'Easy', 'Pieces', 'course', 'comedy', 'classic', 'Last', 'Detail', 'Randle', 'McMurphy', 'Nicholson', 'completely', 'fulfilled', 'promise', 'great', 'actor', 'making', 'expressing', 'talents', 'portraying', 'wild', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'bravado', 'angering', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'imagining', 'watching', 'TV', 'taking', 'fellow', 'patients', 'out', 'fishing', 'boat', 'gradually', 'revealing', 'rage', 'when', 'Ratched', 'one', 'patients', 'kill', 'Nicholson', 'force', 'screen', 'Even', 'Nicholson', 'never', 'made', 'movies', 'afterwards', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'would', 'still', 'confirm', 'status', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'time.Perhaps', 'was', 'wise', 'Forman', 'made', 'many', 'changes', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'who', 'wrote', 'original', '1962', 'novel', 'resented', 'movie', 'gave', 'narration', 'Randle', 'McMurphy', 'instead', 'Chief', 'Bromden', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'many', 'times', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'novel', 'intriguing', 'read', 'film', 'adaptation', 'lot', 'smoother', 'less', 'didactic', 'completely', 'free', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'dense', 'symbolism', 'marred', 'book', 'ex', 'Combine', 'portion', 'where', 'suddenly', 'find', 'out', 'Randle', 'already', 'knew', 'Bromden', 'was', 'feigning', 'deafness', 'When', 'adapt', 'novel', 'film', ""'ve"", 'got', 'compress', 'details', 'make', 'changes', 'as', 'long', 'spirit', 'book', 'movie', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'fine', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'not', 'only', 'turned', 'out', 'fine', 'film', 'adaptation', 'now', 'considerably', 'more', 'well-known', 'book', 'version', 'Maybe', 'Kesey', 'have', 'right', 'be', 'mad', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'truly', 'one', 'American', 'cinema', 'greatest', 'treasures', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'will', 'ensure', 'immortality', 'many', 'generations', 'come.Strongest', 'recommendation', 'buy', 'costs']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

He is just crazy enough for the viewer to wonder if he belongs in the mental facility or if he is just faking to stay out of a labor-yard or the state penitentary.  Some of his interactions with the head nurse and the other patients are unforgettable, like when he pretends he is watching baseball and starts the play by play announcing when the head nurse refuses to let the patients watch the world series.I liked most of the movie and the plot development seemed to be right on cue.  But once the movie started winding down, things stopped being believable.  McMurphy seems to leave and enter the facility whenever he wants, cleverly eluding security, he bribes the guard with a box of liquor, and convinces his girlfriend to sleep with one of the patients.  After the entire routine of trashing the mental facility at the cover of night, he decided to STAY instead of escape, when he could have easily escaped.  This was just absurd and the movie lost its purpose at that point.In typical, depressing fashion, everything falls apart, when the innocent young man commits suicide, McMurphy forsakes another attempt to escape.  I won't give away the ending, but its not satisfying and not what I was hoping for, it made me feel that I wasted 2 1/2 hours of watching the film.There were few enduring lessons; other than the motif of individuals who are on power trips, personified by the head nurse.  The book is a classic and is known for developing this relationship masterfully.  But in a 2 1/2 hour movie, it is hard to accomplish this dense character development.  It just didn't work in my eyes.This film usually gets great ratings, but it just didn't fly for me.  I like classics, like Cool Hand Luke and the Godfather.  But I don't like depressing, meaningless endings.  Death, depression and failure don't necessarily make a ""good"" movie in my eyes.  There needs to be more purpose behind it.

You know the one, it goes a little something like this...""well I read the book and there is no way this film compares to Kesey's classic work"".  Well, to you folks, all I have to write in response is - I AGREE WITH YOU 100%!  And now that I got that out of my system, on with the review.Randall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicolson) is a randy, brawling, neer-do-well who finds himself heading back to prison for statutory rape.  In order to avoid going to jail, McMurphy feigns being insane so that he instead ends up being sentenced to a mental institution.  Of course he expects to ride out his jail sentence in relative comfort and ease there.  However, McMurphy soon discovers all is not bliss.  The institution's ward he's been assigned to is run by the emasculating, all-powerful, autocratic Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).  The rebellious McMurphy immediately clashes with the head nurse as the two of them become ensnared in a struggle for power over the hearts and minds of the other patients.An excellent supporting cast indeed, brilliantly portray 'the cuckoo birds' our two main protagonists are vying over - William Redfield (Harding),  Danny DeVito (Martini),  Vincent Schiavelli (Frederickson), Christopher Lloyd (Taber), Sydney Lassick (Cheswick),  Brad Dourif (Best Supporting  Actor nominee as Billy Bibbit) and finally the great Native American actor Will Sampson (Chief Bromden).  For several of these actors, this was their most memorable performance.  And it is no wonder why, when you are working with as fine of a director as Milos Forman (""Amadeus"", ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", ""Ragtime"" etc...) and the writing duo of Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman (Oscar Winners) who did such an admirable job dramatizing the more personal side of Kesey's masterpiece.  The film is seen from the eyes of Randall Patrick rather than Chief Bromden as it was in the novel.  This is perhaps the most glaring difference between the film and the book.  But, I always try to view the film as it's own work of art, completely separate from the novel it was based (I know, I know, it's much easier said than done, but hey, at least I try).This was Jack's first Oscar, and man oh man did he deserve it.  Out of all the great many roles he's played, his performance as Randall Patrick McMurphy is definitely one of his finest ever.  I know it's clich&eacute; to say that Louise Fletcher was born to play Nurse Ratched.  I can't imagine any other actress in that role.  It is too bad that her career might have been hurt a bit after she played such an evil character.  She never was able to get the big parts after this incredible Oscar winning performance.  And that is a shame, because there is no doubt this woman can act (although I doubt anything could top this performance).  The scenes between Nicolson and Fletcher are simply fascinating!  I highly recommend paying close attention to their facial expressions, their stare downs, the slight inflection of their voices, etc... the next time you are watching this one, particularly during the group therapy sessions where all of the madness indeed manifests itself.

It is the story of a convict who thinks he might be able to take it easy and get off of work details if he gets himself committed to a psychiatric facility. That part of his scheme works but he does not count on how structured life can be in a psych ward. Throughout the film, Nicholson tries to get the system to bend to his will and his wishes. In doing so, he has a few small victories but usually winds up having problems associated with those victories. Some of those problems can be tragic.One of the most fascinating aspects to this film is watching how Nicholson's character shapes and changes the characters of the other inmates. Again, sometimes this is for the better and sometimes it is for the worse.

His interactions with Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif, and a young Danny DeVito are both hilarious and tragic, but it's his conflict with fellow Oscar winner Fletcher, as the hateful, repressed, order-obsessed Nurse Ratched, that ultimately seals his fate.

His prison sentence has a couple of months left to run and he gets himself assigned to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation. It means no more work detail in prison and he sees it as an amusing break.In the hospital he runs up against his ward's boss, nurse Mildred Ratched (Fletcher). She appears nice but dominates, bullies and humiliates the men and sadistically crushes any initiative. When the doctors feel that McMurphy is swinging the lead and should be passed back to the prison service, Ratched views him as unfinished business and angles to keep him in the hospital.For McMurphy, his holiday in the hospital seems to be going well. Despite occasional frustrations and disciplinary issues, he is enjoying himself and, from the viewer's perspective, he appears to be making a difference to the lives of some of the other patients. Nurse Ratched does not view this difference as a benefit.Finally, McMurphy's &quot;holiday&quot; is interrupted when he learns that there is a big difference between the hospital and prison. He can on longer expect automatic release when his sentence is up. Far from it, he discovers that he faces a much longer stay than he expected.Jack Nicholson is absolutely brilliant in this film. His portrayal of McMurphy is the best piece of acting that I have ever seen. The viewer is totally immersed in this character and it makes the hospital environment completely convincing. The rest of the cast do a fine job as assorted other patients.

99353,A25CQTB313XDWO,0790732181,"JON STRICKLAND ""Jon Strickland""","[1, 1]","One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was a most unique, Academy Award winning film. Never before have I witnessed a motion picture where a character such as R.P. McMurphy, as well portrayed by Jack Nicholson, is admitted into a mental institution and as a patient quickly sees the lack of care administered by the available nurses and doctors. Quite disturbing is the idea that he is not formally educated and yet is the only one who truly sees the underlying problems that prevent the psychiatric ward from becoming a well-run facility. Also troubling is seeing that his attempts to address any concerns or solutions to the administrators are met with responses in the nature of &quot;Don't bother trying to help us, little man. We know what's best for you and your kind&quot;.The cold attitudes and retorts that McMurphy and the rest of the patients deal with are primarily expressed by the head nurse,  Mildred Ratched, who is the mouthpiece of the doctors and staff. As a medical worker and as a person, she keeps herself both physically and emotionally at more than an arm's distance from the patients. She is there to recite and strictly enforce her interpretation of the rules and regulations of the hospital, many of which are questionable and seem to be adding to the detriment as opposed to the benefit of each patient. Anyone who questions Nurse Ratched will often be replied to by her soft-spoken but inflexible demands that the rules are established and that changing them or bending them a little for maybe just one evening is unacceptable.Throughout the movie, Nurse Ratched and the rest of the staff seem to carry out this passive aggressive power trip of not just enforcing the rules but also tossing all the patients' concerns to the side and then fitting them around all the regulations present. Instead of acknowledging that their strict interpretations might be preventing the mentally ill from receiving the help that they need, they simply gloss over their lack of expressed concern or performance and believe that having everyone simply comply with the enforced hospital codes will be a fix-all.This classic is one of the most thought-provoking films I have ever seen, and it is regarded as a display of individualism versus institutional conformity. More explicitly, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is also a personification of how truly dealing with the heart of the matter can come into conflict with an institutionalized strict, letter-by-letter, interpretation of due process.And for those, including myself, who sometimes serve as figures of authority, there is a stark, but very important, theme that appears to emanate from this film.

The ensemble work here by Nicholson, Fletcher, Lloyd, Redfield, Lassick, Sampson, Devito and the rest is among the finest ever captured. Not a false note plays in any of the performances. These actors fully inhabit the skins of these characters and therefore, create three dimensional people that connect spiritually and fully to the audience's empathy.The script is air tight as it oscillates between comedy and tragedy. This occurs often not only in the same scene but in the same take. The film compliments the novel nicely (but exist in completely different spheres), although much of the books surreal symbolism is lost in favor of a clear linear narrative. The film also shifts the point of view from Chief's (in the novel) to McMurphy.  Many of my favorite lines in film history are in this movie. ""Least I tried, G*******t, least I did that!"" is a motto that has guided my life.When viewed with its near twin COOL HAND LUKE (my third favorite film of all time), one can see the possibly dated, but no less intriguing subtext of the criminal/prisoner as savior. Many souls are saved as a direct result of McMurphy's (and Luke's) ultimate sacrifice.The film is entertaining, enlightening and reflective without the slightest hint of pretension.A brief note about this special edition two disc DVD: the behind the scenes material only briefly mentions author Ken Kesey. There is no footage of him weighing in with his experiences writing the original novel. This is criminal.  I know the late Kesey disowned this film and I don't blame him considering the experience he had. However the producers and screenwriter virtually ignore the brilliant Oregonian who wrote one of America's greatest novels.With each viewing (I've seen the film probably 30+ times) it appears as fresh and beautiful as the first.

Anyone familiar with the book will recognize that Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher do not look anything like the descriptions of their characters, and yet they capture the spirit of those characters perfectly.  The action has been moved forward in time fifteen years to 1975.  This is one of Nicholson's best performances.  The movie has an objective, documentary feel to it.  We miss out on some characterization because of this (especially the Chief's) but instead we get a sense of what it would be like in a real institution.  Despite the subject-matter, it is very funny and has moments of true joy.  It is a marvelous piece of 70's filmmaking and ranks as #12 on the IMDB Greatest Movies list.  Definitely worth owning.THE DVD'S:The DVD's were made from a new transfer so they look and sound terrific.  Unfortunately, it is a 2-DVD set, but all of the information could have easily fit on one disc.  The only things on the second disc are some deleted scenes and a making-of documentary.  The documentary is good, but not great.  It tells of how Kirk Douglas first discovered the book and tried to make a movie out of it, but not of the friction when his son Michael (the film's producer) told him he was too old to be in it.  There is also no mention of the film's success and its sweep of all the top Oscars.  They don't even talk about novelist Ken Kesey (who supposedly was so against the film he still hasn't seen it).",5,Great Movie,1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,1589,"['MOVIE', 'ITSELF', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'one', 'authentically', 'great', 'movie', 'Milos', 'Foreman', 'ever', 'made', 'been', 'imitating', 'ever', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'book', 'will', 'recognize', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'anything', 'descriptions', 'characters', 'yet', 'capture', 'spirit', 'characters', 'perfectly', 'action', 'been', 'moved', 'forward', 'time', 'fifteen', 'years', '1975', 'one', 'Nicholson', 'best', 'performances', 'movie', 'objective', 'documentary', 'feel', 'miss', 'out', 'characterization', 'especially', 'Chief', 'instead', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'institution', 'subject-matter', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'true', 'joy', 'marvelous', 'piece', '70', 'filmmaking', 'ranks', '12', 'IMDB', 'Greatest', 'Movies', 'list', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'owning.THE', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'were', 'made', 'new', 'transfer', 'look', 'sound', 'terrific', 'Unfortunately', '2-DVD', 'set', 'information', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'fit', 'one', 'disc', 'only', 'things', 'second', 'disc', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'documentary', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'how', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'first', 'discovered', 'book', 'tried', 'make', 'movie', 'not', 'friction', 'when', 'son', 'Michael', 'film', 'producer', 'told', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'also', 'mention', 'film', 'success', 'sweep', 'top', 'Oscars', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'talk', 'novelist', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'who', 'supposedly', 'was', 'so', 'film', 'still', ""n't"", 'seen']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

99369,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,0790732181,King of Controversy,"[0, 6]","I'm either a racist, or an intelligent, racially aware, with-it white guy (you decide). For me, the enduring image One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest brings to mind is that of white patients being lorded over by their caretakers: women and people of color. They don't just line up on separate sides of the basketball court, they are literally fighting each other throughout the film.The exception to this is Chief Bromden's and R.P. McMurphy's friendship. The Chief is played here by Will Sampson. His mental illness makes the original story hard to follow. The Chief is the one who escapes at the end while native american music plays accompanying the credits. Is this enough to make the film acceptable or politically correct? Or is the film simply a ahead of it's time - we're supposed to link Native American's and their tribulations with the the later day dispossession of whites and so feel a kinship of sorts? The problem with this is that the ancestors of R.P McMurphy are the ones who dispossessed Native Americans, and Will Sampson is only a Native American actor reading a line. I wonder if Ken Kasey had Will Sampson in mind when he wrote the book? He seems such a natural fit for the part of Chief Bromden. I wonder if somehow the idea for the film preceded the book.I wonder if McMurphy is intended to be an everyman in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest? In one scene the Chief tells McMurphy, ""I seen the bottle work on him (my father)"" Then he adds cryptically, ""Just like they are working on you now."" Later in the film McMurphy is subjected to shock treatment and then finally lobotomized. This is done simply as a means to punish, and as a means to control the subject. Earlier in the film the prison doctor reveals he believes McMurphy is faking his mental illness. 'I believe you're a malingerer' he tells McMurphy. I'm not sure McMurphy's lobotomy in the film is meant to be an allusion to something else, but a reviewer on my friends list claims the American public has been subjected to a kind of 'self inflicted lobotomy'. Perhaps it forms a fitting image.Most of the film takes place in the mental ward. They did a wonderful job using contrasts of light and shadow to make the film visually appealing. I have to give this film a mixed review, however. To me, it seems as though the film quietly promotes counter-culture values? As I noted a 'lobotomy' earlier, and even as many reviewers applaud this film's celebration of individuality: one man against a cold institution, or one might say here man against the machine, men like R.P. McMurphy no longer exist in our society. At least not white men, except perhaps as a straw man, a ghost to be conjured up and then railed against.

McMurphy as a volunteer mental patient with a hyperactive attitude. After tangling with the strict nurse (played by Louise Fletcher) and being degraded by her in front of all the other loonies he decides to bend the rules and create an even bigger rift between them. He at one point even escapes and takes the motley crue of comatose and whacked out people on a fishing trip, claiming "" Cheer up Martini, we're not loonies, we're not loonies we're fishermen"" but this creates more tension and after raising the roof a bit more he ends up forming a strange friendship with the chief and as it ends he is punished severely, he is electrocuted and when that doesn't stop him they decide to lobotomize and therefore ends up being killed in his peril by the chief to save him from the agony that would be the rest of his life.The film raises the question "" are institutes really this grim and dependant on routine? Do people have to eat through straws, are the frontal lobotomies necessary? I think this film gives a message and a whole load of entertainment with it.The film is one of the most original things I have ever seen it was adapted from a Ken Casey novel but doesn't steal it outright, it adds atmosphere and joy.

It is thought that the easy life of an insane asylum is far better than the bars of a prison. Certainly RP McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) thinks so. All he's done is have sex with a 15 year old - she claimed she was 18 - and he doesn't feel like doing work duty to wile away his time. He plays insane and figures he'll sit around and talk with the loonies for a while instead.Unfortunately for RP, the woman in charge of this ward is Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). She runs a tight ship, and likes everything just so. Into her tidy little world comes the freewheeling RP, out to get the inmates to do wild things like watch the World Series instead of sit around and talk therapy.Even though Nurse Ratched denies RP's quest to watch baseball, still, she almost seems to be helping the inmates - talking reasonably with them, giving them logical reasons why things are the way they are. Still, as time goes on, you start to sense that her priorities aren't necessarily with the patients. What she says seems reasonable - but the manner in which she pursues things, even when it's clearly bothering the patients, makes you think otherwise.By the end of the movie, it is quite clear that Nurse Ratched is deliberately taking actions to cause great harm to her patients, to keep them docile and dependant. RP is only inches away from escape ...What is amazing about this movie is not the specific plot - which rambles in and out of the various insane inmates' minds - but is the ensemble of actors gathered. Many of these actors went on to win awards, and each one is pretty much perfect in his or her role. Yes, the two main characters richly deserve the Oscars they won. But the casting director did a stupendous job here, casting the cream of the crop in terms of who could play each of these individuals. It is that group effort that really allows the realism to shine through, and to make this movie just as powerful and relatable now as it was when it first came out.Highly recommended.Note: This movie was #20 on the AFI top 100 movies of all time.",5,An Incredible Ensemble Cast,1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,2185,"['Many', 'murder', 'shows', 'have', 'plotline', 'murderer', 'plead', 'insanity', 'rather', 'face', 'real', 'consequences', 'actions', 'thought', 'easy', 'life', 'insane', 'asylum', 'far', 'better', 'bars', 'prison', 'Certainly', 'RP', 'McMurphy', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'so', 'done', 'have', 'sex', '15', 'year', 'old', 'claimed', 'was', '18', ""n't"", 'feel', 'doing', 'work', 'duty', 'wile', 'away', 'time', 'insane', ""'ll"", 'sit', 'around', 'talk', 'loonies', 'while', 'instead.Unfortunately', 'RP', 'woman', 'charge', 'ward', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'tight', 'ship', 'everything', 'just', 'so', 'Into', 'tidy', 'little', 'world', 'freewheeling', 'RP', 'get', 'inmates', 'do', 'wild', 'things', 'watch', 'World', 'Series', 'instead', 'sit', 'talk', 'therapy.Even', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'RP', 'quest', 'watch', 'baseball', 'still', 'almost', 'be', 'helping', 'inmates', 'talking', 'reasonably', 'giving', 'logical', 'reasons', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'way', 'are', 'Still', 'time', 'start', 'sense', 'priorities', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'patients', 'What', 'reasonable', 'manner', 'things', 'even', 'when', 'clearly', 'bothering', 'patients', 'think', 'end', 'movie', 'quite', 'clear', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'deliberately', 'taking', 'actions', 'cause', 'great', 'harm', 'patients', 'keep', 'docile', 'dependant', 'RP', 'only', 'inches', 'away', 'escape', 'What', 'amazing', 'movie', 'not', 'specific', 'plot', 'various', 'insane', 'inmates', 'minds', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'gathered', 'Many', 'actors', 'went', 'win', 'awards', 'one', 'pretty', 'much', 'perfect', 'role', 'Yes', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'richly', 'deserve', 'Oscars', 'won', 'casting', 'director', 'did', 'stupendous', 'job', 'here', 'casting', 'cream', 'crop', 'terms', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'individuals', 'group', 'effort', 'really', 'realism', 'shine', 'make', 'movie', 'just', 'powerful', 'relatable', 'now', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out.Highly', 'recommended.Note', 'movie', 'was', '20', 'AFI', 'top', '100', 'movies', 'time']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
99377,A2KSU7OOJ5C479,0790732181,"Loren D. Morrison ""amateur_reviewer""","[2, 3]","Since every professional reviewer in the business has probably reviewed this movie,  there's not much new that I can come up with in the categories of acting quality, plot analysis, or technical quality that hasn't already been discussed.Then, what new can I bring to the table? My emotional reactions to ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is what I have to offer. Did I like it or not? Did it make me laugh? Did it make me want to weep? Was I emotionally attracted to, or repulsed by, any of the characters? In a nutshell, the answer to all of these questions is yes. It's the why of these emotional reactions that makes me want to review it.First of all, it works on multiple levels. It works as a comedy and it works as a tragedy. It makes you love and it makes you hate. It puts your empathy to work, and it makes you hate.Blind rigid authority is here in the person of Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. (My friends and I referred to her as Nurse Rat S..t. It's been a while, but I think McMurphy did too.) Her authoritarian, uncaring, by the rules, mentality harmed, in one way or another, every one of her patients. With Nurse Ratched on duty there would be no happiness tolerated.Love of life, and ""in your face"" rejection of authority is what Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, is made of. Amazingly, his rebellion, coupled with comaraderie did more for his fellow mental ward patients than years of Nurse Ratched's untender unloving care.Nicholson and his impish grin arranged for ""outings"" and ""entertainments"" for his co-patients that were definitely against all the rules, but which provided the happiest times that any of these patients had ever had. They also provided temporary ""cures"" from what ailed them. It was in these scenes that the movie was a comedy. In one scene, he introduces the entire group as a doctors on tour, and, amazingly, they became the epitome of doctors on an outing. Another bit of high (or perhaps low) comedy was when he managed to arrange to have a group of women snuck into the ward to ""entertain"" his companions.As well as working as a comedy, the movie certainly works as a tragedy. McMurphy may have won a few battles, but Nurse Ratched won the war. In this war, McMurphy was the chief casualty. If there is anyone reading this who hasn't seen the movie, I won't spoil it by telling you the form her revenge takes (and revenge it is).  Although some professional reviewers discuss the climax in detail, I think it is better to see it yourself for maximum impact.A performance that many reviewers, both professional and amateur, seem to have only occasionally mentioned in passing was that of Will Sampson as Chief Bromden. He had me believing that he really was catatonic. So much so that I was shocked when he finally spoke.What else can I say? Someone to love, someone to hate - something to laugh at, something to become outraged over - a cast of supporting players that includes such stars and stars in the making as Scatman Crothers, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd in small parts.",5,"""NO HAPPINESS WILL BE TOLERATED"" NURSE RATCHED",1049846400,"04 9, 2003",2003,3042,"['professional', 'reviewer', 'business', 'probably', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'new', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'categories', 'acting', 'quality', 'plot', 'analysis', 'technical', 'quality', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'discussed.Then', 'what', 'new', 'can', 'bring', 'table', 'emotional', 'reactions', 'ONE', 'FLEW', 'THE', 'CUCKOO', 'NEST', 'what', 'have', 'offer', 'Did', 'like', 'not', 'make', 'Did', 'make', 'want', 'weep', 'Was', 'emotionally', 'attracted', 'repulsed', 'characters', 'nutshell', 'answer', 'questions', 'yes', 'why', 'emotional', 'reactions', 'want', 'review', 'it.First', 'multiple', 'levels', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'love', 'hate', 'empathy', 'work', 'hate.Blind', 'rigid', 'authority', 'here', 'person', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'friends', 'referred', 'Nurse', 'Rat', 'S..t.', 'been', 'while', 'think', 'McMurphy', 'did', 'too', 'authoritarian', 'uncaring', 'rules', 'mentality', 'harmed', 'one', 'way', 'one', 'patients', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'duty', 'would', 'be', 'happiness', 'tolerated.Love', 'life', 'face', 'rejection', 'authority', 'what', 'Randle', 'McMurphy', 'played', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'made', 'Amazingly', 'rebellion', 'coupled', 'comaraderie', 'did', 'more', 'fellow', 'mental', 'ward', 'patients', 'years', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'untender', 'unloving', 'care.Nicholson', 'impish', 'grin', 'arranged', 'outings', 'entertainments', 'co-patients', 'were', 'definitely', 'rules', 'provided', 'happiest', 'times', 'patients', 'had', 'ever', 'had', 'also', 'provided', 'temporary', 'cures', 'what', 'ailed', 'was', 'scenes', 'movie', 'was', 'comedy', 'one', 'scene', 'entire', 'group', 'doctors', 'tour', 'amazingly', 'became', 'epitome', 'doctors', 'outing', 'bit', 'high', 'perhaps', 'low', 'comedy', 'was', 'when', 'managed', 'arrange', 'have', 'group', 'women', 'snuck', 'ward', 'entertain', 'companions.As', 'well', 'as', 'working', 'comedy', 'movie', 'certainly', 'tragedy', 'McMurphy', 'may', 'have', 'won', 'few', 'battles', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'won', 'war', 'war', 'McMurphy', 'was', 'chief', 'casualty', 'anyone', 'reading', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'telling', 'form', 'revenge', 'revenge', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'discuss', 'climax', 'detail', 'think', 'better', 'see', 'maximum', 'impact.A', 'performance', 'many', 'reviewers', 'professional', 'amateur', 'seem', 'have', 'only', 'occasionally', 'mentioned', 'passing', 'was', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'Chief', 'Bromden', 'had', 'believing', 'really', 'was', 'catatonic', 'So', 'much', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'finally', 'spoke.What', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'Someone', 'love', 'someone', 'hate', 'something', 'laugh', 'something', 'become', 'outraged', 'cast', 'supporting', 'players', 'such', 'stars', 'stars', 'making', 'Scatman', 'Crothers', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'small', 'parts']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

They want their freedom, they don't know what to choose, and all other details make them interesting characters. We pity them when the guards are mean to them and we finally hate the guards.

99385,AK9UPC78LIPIR,0790732181,maelje,"[0, 1]","The mid-1970s was a tremendous era for movies, with youngish film directors able to make bold personal statements thanks to a studio system that was not nearly as rigid as in previous generations. Unfortunately, that time would not last, but the result is that today we enjoy a time in which a very healthy ""indie"" environment helps shape popular tastes.I spent a lot of time in movie theaters back then, watching what in retrospect amounts to blockbuster after blockbuster -- ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" the first ""Rocky"" (which, people might forget, was a superb film) and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.""I was 14 when it came out, and had not even read Ken Kesey's novel yet. I went to see it, and was so moved I went back and saw it next week. After that, I read the book. After that, I read Kesey's ""Sometimes a Great Notion."" For awhile back then, Ken Kesey was my fictive universe.I've recently revisited all that stuff, and also viewed Paul Newman's adaptation of ""Notion,"" which isn't easy to find. (I think I rented it on Netflix.)One of the differences between mere entertainment and true art is that art not only holds up but seems to deepen over time. And Milos Forman's film adaptation of ""Cuckoo's Nest"" has done just that. The movie basically swept the Academy Awards the year after its release, but come on ... is it really that good?Acting: Check. Not only Oscar winners Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched and Jack Nicholson as R.P. McMurphy, but the entire cast, which included William Redfield, Brad Dourif, Danny De Vito and Christopher Lloyd.Directing: Check. Forman had directed nine films prior to this one, but was still relatively unknown. I think it could be argued that his helming of ""Nest"" was a turning point in his career -- he would go on, after this, to direct ""Ragtime,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt,"" ""Man on the Moon"" and ""The Ghost of Munich."" His Academy Award for best director of ""Nest"" was well-deserved.Adapted screenplay: Check, with some reservations. Bo Goldman and Laurence Hauben did make some changes that did not sit well with fans of Kesey's novel, including, apparently, the author himself. One common complaint was that the focus shifted from Chief Bromden to McMurphy himself. I can see this point; Bromden narrated the book, and it is his voice and his evolution as a character that drives the book. But doing the film that way would've been very ... artificial. Bromden was, we'll recall, pretending to be a deaf mute to fool the staff at the mental hospital into basically leaving him alone. Framing the film that way would have required a voice-over, and in this case such a device would've just gotten in the way of the storytelling.Best Picutre: Was it? Here was the incredible competition that year: ""Barry Lyndon,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""Jaws"" and ""Nashville""!! Double exclamation point indeed! Rarely has there been a year with so many worthy BP nominations. ANY of these films would have been a worthy choice for best picture. I am a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick, but I think ""Cuckoo's Nest"" was a better film than ""Barry Lyndon."" ""Dog Day"" was basically a thriller with several social messages, while ""Jaws"" and ""Nashville"" were probably the most purely entertaining. But ""Cuckoo's Nest"" won, and few could argue it was less worthy than the others.Bottom line: If you've never seen this film, DO SO. And if you can, get the two-disc version and watch all the extras. The story of this film is nearly as fascinating as the film itself. I won't spoil that story arc, but will just say it took a lot of time, effort and some false starts to get this fine film made.",5,"If anything, it has grown in stature",1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,3653,"['mid-1970s', 'was', 'tremendous', 'era', 'movies', 'youngish', 'film', 'directors', 'able', 'make', 'bold', 'personal', 'statements', 'thanks', 'studio', 'system', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'rigid', 'previous', 'generations', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'would', 'not', 'last', 'result', 'today', 'enjoy', 'time', 'very', 'healthy', 'indie', 'environment', 'shape', 'popular', 'tastes.I', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'movie', 'theaters', 'back', 'then', 'watching', 'what', 'retrospect', 'amounts', 'blockbuster', 'blockbuster', 'Jaws', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'first', 'Rocky', 'people', 'might', 'forget', 'was', 'superb', 'film', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'was', '14', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'not', 'even', 'read', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'novel', 'yet', 'went', 'see', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'went', 'back', 'saw', 'next', 'week', 'read', 'book', 'read', 'Kesey', 'Sometimes', 'Great', 'Notion', 'awhile', 'back', 'then', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'was', 'fictive', 'universe.I', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'revisited', 'stuff', 'also', 'viewed', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'adaptation', 'Notion', ""n't"", 'easy', 'find', 'think', 'rented', 'Netflix', 'One', 'differences', 'mere', 'entertainment', 'true', 'art', 'art', 'not', 'only', 'up', 'deepen', 'over', 'time', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'done', 'just', 'movie', 'basically', 'swept', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'year', 'release', 'come', 'really', 'good', 'Acting', 'Check', 'Not', 'only', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'R.P', 'McMurphy', 'entire', 'cast', 'included', 'William', 'Redfield', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Danny', 'De', 'Vito', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd.Directing', 'Check', 'Forman', 'had', 'directed', 'nine', 'films', 'prior', 'one', 'was', 'still', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'helming', 'Nest', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'career', 'would', 'go', 'direct', 'Ragtime', 'Amadeus', 'People', 'Vs.', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'Man', 'Moon', 'Ghost', 'Munich', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'director', 'Nest', 'was', 'well-deserved.Adapted', 'screenplay', 'Check', 'reservations', 'Bo', 'Goldman', 'Laurence', 'Hauben', 'did', 'make', 'changes', 'did', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'fans', 'Kesey', 'novel', 'including', 'apparently', 'author', 'One', 'common', 'complaint', 'was', 'focus', 'shifted', 'Chief', 'Bromden', 'McMurphy', 'can', 'see', 'point', 'Bromden', 'narrated', 'book', 'voice', 'evolution', 'character', 'book', 'doing', 'film', 'way', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'artificial', 'Bromden', 'was', ""'ll"", 'recall', 'pretending', 'be', 'deaf', 'mute', 'fool', 'staff', 'mental', 'hospital', 'basically', 'leaving', 'alone', 'Framing', 'film', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'voice-over', 'case', 'device', 'would', ""'ve"", 'just', 'gotten', 'way', 'storytelling.Best', 'Picutre', 'Was', 'Here', 'was', 'incredible', 'competition', 'year', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Jaws', 'Nashville', 'Double', 'exclamation', 'point', 'indeed', 'Rarely', 'there', 'been', 'year', 'so', 'many', 'worthy', 'BP', 'nominations', 'ANY', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worthy', 'choice', 'best', 'picture', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'think', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'was', 'better', 'film', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', 'Dog', 'Day', 'was', 'basically', 'thriller', 'several', 'social', 'messages', 'Jaws', 'Nashville', 'were', 'probably', 'most', 'purely', 'entertaining', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'won', 'few', 'could', 'argue', 'was', 'less', 'worthy', 'others.Bottom', 'line', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'DO', 'SO', 'can', 'get', 'two-disc', 'version', 'watch', 'extras', 'story', 'film', 'nearly', 'as', 'fascinating', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'story', 'arc', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'took', 'lot', 'time', 'effort', 'false', 'starts', 'get', 'fine', 'film', 'made']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

Within these friendly confines Jack Nicholson gave the performance by which I measure all his others.  Randall Patrick McMurphy is a rebel.  He's anti-establishment.  He likes women and to have a drink and to watch baseball.  In some ways he represents the absolute worst of men, yet at the same time he also represents much of the best in men, and at ALL times he is definitely a &quot;man's man&quot;.He has been sent to prison for statutory rape, but he's not particularly remorseful about it because the girl looked and acted older and wanted it.  We should be appalled by McMurphy's attitude, yet Nicholson plays him pretty much the way Kesey wrote him, and we sympathize with him.McMurphy has earned a trip to the state mental hospital by acting &quot;a little nuts&quot; and you recognize by watching that McMurphy is the kind of guy who would not hesitate to &quot;act a little nuts&quot; to get off of the hard manual labor of a state pen chain-gang.  But at this mental hospital McMurphy runs up against his worst nightmare: Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched.Louise Fletcher earned her best actress Oscar in one of the most methodically unsympathetic roles in silver screen history.  Nurse Ratched pretends to have the best interests of the patients in mind, yet she is obviously subtly manipulating not only the patients, but also the remainder of the hospital staff to maintain an iron rod of control over her little corner of the universe. Crossing Nurse Ratched is a certain path to disaster for those who are in her sphere.McMurphy and Ratched cross swords over and over.  It could have become boring or depressing, but we are entertained repeatedly by McMurphy's ingenious or bravura attempts to one-up Nurse Ratched.  Yet SHE is the one who has the power in this universe, and I could only marvel at her as she cold-heartedly crushes the life from McMurphy and the other patients.If ever Academy Awards were given out for &quot;Best Supporting Cast&quot;, this one would have taken that one as well.A film for the ages.",5,The Quintessential Jack Nicholson performance,1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,2137,"['Ken', 'Kesey', 'brilliant', 'novel', 'perfectly', 'adapted', 'screen', 'expertly', 'directed', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'friendly', 'confines', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'gave', 'performance', 'measure', 'others', 'Randall', 'Patrick', 'McMurphy', 'rebel', 'anti-establishment', 'women', 'have', 'drink', 'watch', 'baseball', 'ways', 'absolute', 'worst', 'men', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'much', 'best', 'men', 'ALL', 'times', 'definitely', 'quot', 'man', 'man', 'quot', '.He', 'been', 'sent', 'prison', 'statutory', 'rape', 'not', 'particularly', 'remorseful', 'girl', 'looked', 'acted', 'older', 'wanted', 'should', 'be', 'appalled', 'McMurphy', 'attitude', 'yet', 'Nicholson', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'Kesey', 'wrote', 'sympathize', 'him.McMurphy', 'earned', 'trip', 'state', 'mental', 'hospital', 'acting', 'quot', 'little', 'nuts', 'quot', 'recognize', 'watching', 'McMurphy', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'quot', 'act', 'little', 'nuts', 'quot', 'get', 'hard', 'manual', 'labor', 'state', 'pen', 'chain-gang', 'mental', 'hospital', 'McMurphy', 'up', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'Nurse', 'Ratched.Louise', 'Fletcher', 'earned', 'best', 'actress', 'Oscar', 'one', 'most', 'methodically', 'unsympathetic', 'roles', 'silver', 'screen', 'history', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'have', 'best', 'interests', 'patients', 'mind', 'obviously', 'subtly', 'manipulating', 'not', 'only', 'patients', 'also', 'remainder', 'hospital', 'staff', 'maintain', 'iron', 'rod', 'control', 'little', 'corner', 'universe', 'Crossing', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'certain', 'path', 'disaster', 'who', 'are', 'sphere.McMurphy', 'Ratched', 'cross', 'swords', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'boring', 'depressing', 'are', 'entertained', 'repeatedly', 'McMurphy', 'ingenious', 'bravura', 'attempts', 'one-up', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'SHE', 'one', 'who', 'power', 'universe', 'could', 'only', 'marvel', 'cold-heartedly', 'life', 'McMurphy', 'other', 'patients.If', 'ever', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'were', 'given', 'out', 'quot', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Cast', 'quot', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'one', 'well.A', 'film', 'ages']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It is greater than I recall it to be!IMHO this is director Milos Forman's best movie, better than his other two excellent opuses: ""Amadeus"" (1984) and ""Rag Time"" (1981).The outstanding strength of this drama is based on a strange confrontation. In one side stands the Rightful Nurse and in the other The Crook; she applies the Law to attain unlawful goals and exercise power; he evades the Law to attain justice and welfare for his impaired mates.Both characters meet head-on with devastating results for them and the people surrounding them. The issue that shocks me most is to realize how an outsider may be able to asses which are the needs of internees where professionals fail.There are three major high points in this film: playacting, script and direction.Jack Nicholson as The Crook delivers one of his best performances in a career that has many high quality characterizations. He is able to convey to the viewers the complex and contradictory personality of McMurphy and win the Oscar to Best Actor in Leading Role.Louise Fletcher performs at the same height as Nicholson with more sober acting resources and also deservedly won the Oscar. Actually she never again reached that level of excellence.In secondary roles Danny de Vito, Vincent Schiavelli, Will Sampson and specially Brad Dourif (Oscar nominee) are paramount.The script due to Bo Goldman & Lawrence Hauben makes the most of every scene and gives no respite.Finally Milos Forman's direction is impeccable extracting the best from each actress & actor and delivers an unforgettable film that will be remembered as one of the best of the '70s.This is a great movie for adult audience and deserves to be in any movie fan collection!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,A Parable about Freedom.,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,1894,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoos', 'Nest', '1975', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'was', 'deeply', 'affected', 'dramatic', 'force.Just', 'now', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'again', 'greater', 'recall', 'be', 'IMHO', 'director', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'best', 'movie', 'better', 'other', 'two', 'excellent', 'opuses', 'Amadeus', '1984', 'Rag', 'Time', '1981', '.The', 'outstanding', 'strength', 'drama', 'based', 'strange', 'confrontation', 'one', 'side', 'Rightful', 'Nurse', 'other', 'Crook', 'Law', 'attain', 'unlawful', 'goals', 'exercise', 'power', 'Law', 'attain', 'justice', 'welfare', 'impaired', 'mates.Both', 'characters', 'meet', 'head-on', 'devastating', 'results', 'people', 'surrounding', 'issue', 'most', 'realize', 'how', 'outsider', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'asses', 'are', 'needs', 'internees', 'where', 'professionals', 'are', 'three', 'major', 'high', 'points', 'film', 'playacting', 'script', 'direction.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Crook', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'many', 'high', 'quality', 'characterizations', 'able', 'convey', 'viewers', 'complex', 'contradictory', 'personality', 'McMurphy', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Leading', 'Role.Louise', 'Fletcher', 'performs', 'same', 'height', 'Nicholson', 'more', 'sober', 'acting', 'resources', 'also', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Actually', 'never', 'again', 'reached', 'level', 'excellence.In', 'secondary', 'roles', 'Danny', 'Vito', 'Vincent', 'Schiavelli', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'specially', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'are', 'paramount.The', 'script', 'due', 'Bo', 'Goldman', 'Lawrence', 'Hauben', 'most', 'scene', 'respite.Finally', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'direction', 'impeccable', 'extracting', 'best', 'actress', 'actor', 'delivers', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'best', ""'70s.This"", 'great', 'movie', 'adult', 'audience', 'be', 'movie', 'fan', 'collection', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I've seen plenty of movies that have been shoddy adaptations of books, but this movie was definitely not one of them. For those of you who have not read the book, the movie is clear enough on what it is about, requiring no previous knowledge of the book (unlike certain other movies, such as Harry Potter) and if you did read the book, I am sure you'll be happy to notice that the movie remains overall faithful, with the changes being minor. A bit has been cut out, but that's to be expected with book to movie adaptations.Jack Nicholson is an awesome actor, and he really embraced this role. While I imagined Randle Patrick McMurphy to be taller and stronger (and more Irish-looking), Jack had the right attitude for the role, so I can forgive the person in charge of casting.

Rather, this is a story of man's struggle in every society where dictatorship aborts dreams and dignities.A recidivist criminal, McMurphy, is transferred to a mental insitution instead of prison.As his trick to spend an easier sentence, McMurphy(played by Jack Nicholson) thought he can leave any time he wishes since he's perfectly sane. The cast of the mental patients was perfectly picked to show a submissive group of people that most of them chose this life and chose being in this asylum.I once read about a scientific experiment were researchers divided a large fish tank in half by putting a glass wall in the middle. A barracuda was put on one side of the tank and a mackerel on the other. The hungry barracuda tried to get the mackerel but smacked into the glass barrier. Again and again, the barracuda smacked the glass in its attempt to reach its dinner. Finally, realizing how futile its attempts were, the barracuda gave up. Researchers then removed the wall to see what would happen. Surprisingly, the barracuda made no new attempts to reach the mackerel. It eventually starved to death even though food was within easy reach.. The technical term for what happened is ""learned helplessness"". The barracuda had learned to be helpless from its many failed attempts to reach the other fish. When the barrier was removed, the barracuda continued to operate as if the glass wall was still there.This Learned helplessness is the best term to describe the patients of the asylem depicted in the movie. A group of people that couldn't change any thing in their devestating lives and chose to be in a place were things were pre-chosen for them any way. McMurphy , the charismatic rebel by nature, tried to stand up to the main authority represented by a tyrant called Nurse Ratched played outstandingly by Louise Fletcher. The confrontations between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched started to by funny and silly but developed to be tragically fatal as McMurphy finds out that Ratched don't only have the authority to control the patients physically and mentally, but also the authority to keep him in the insititution for ever and even permanantly disable him.The great acting will keep your heart ingaged while the story of a dream, friendship and the sense of belonging is being born among the guys. High prices are paid to reach a dream, but the dream will live while telling the story of:Wire, briar, limber-lockThree geese in a flockOne flew east, one flew westAnd one flew over the Cuckoo's nest.",5,One of the greatest American films of all time,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,2845,"['Relesed', '1975', 'One', 'flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'won', 'five', 'major', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'actor', 'lead', 'role', 'best', 'actress', 'lead', 'role', 'best', 'director', 'best', 'screenplay.An', 'adaption', '1962', 'novel', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'filmed', 'setting', 'novel', 'Oregon', 'State', 'Hospital', 'movie', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'romantic', 'plot', 'Rather', 'story', 'man', 'struggle', 'society', 'where', 'dictatorship', 'dreams', 'dignities.A', 'recidivist', 'criminal', 'McMurphy', 'transferred', 'mental', 'insitution', 'instead', 'prison.As', 'trick', 'spend', 'easier', 'sentence', 'McMurphy', 'played', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'thought', 'can', 'leave', 'time', 'perfectly', 'sane', 'cast', 'mental', 'patients', 'was', 'perfectly', 'picked', 'show', 'submissive', 'group', 'people', 'most', 'chose', 'life', 'chose', 'being', 'asylum.I', 'once', 'read', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'were', 'researchers', 'divided', 'large', 'fish', 'tank', 'half', 'putting', 'glass', 'wall', 'middle', 'barracuda', 'was', 'put', 'one', 'side', 'tank', 'mackerel', 'other', 'hungry', 'barracuda', 'tried', 'get', 'mackerel', 'smacked', 'glass', 'barrier', 'Again', 'again', 'barracuda', 'smacked', 'glass', 'attempt', 'reach', 'dinner', 'Finally', 'realizing', 'how', 'futile', 'attempts', 'were', 'barracuda', 'gave', 'up', 'Researchers', 'then', 'removed', 'wall', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Surprisingly', 'barracuda', 'made', 'new', 'attempts', 'reach', 'mackerel', 'eventually', 'starved', 'death', 'even', 'food', 'was', 'easy', 'reach..', 'technical', 'term', 'what', 'happened', 'learned', 'helplessness', 'barracuda', 'had', 'learned', 'be', 'helpless', 'many', 'failed', 'attempts', 'reach', 'other', 'fish', 'When', 'barrier', 'was', 'removed', 'barracuda', 'continued', 'operate', 'glass', 'wall', 'was', 'still', 'there.This', 'Learned', 'helplessness', 'best', 'term', 'describe', 'patients', 'asylem', 'depicted', 'movie', 'group', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'change', 'thing', 'devestating', 'lives', 'chose', 'be', 'place', 'were', 'things', 'were', 'pre-chosen', 'way', 'McMurphy', 'charismatic', 'rebel', 'nature', 'tried', 'stand', 'up', 'main', 'authority', 'represented', 'tyrant', 'called', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'played', 'outstandingly', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'confrontations', 'McMurphy', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'started', 'funny', 'silly', 'developed', 'be', 'tragically', 'fatal', 'McMurphy', 'out', 'Ratched', 'do', ""n't"", 'only', 'have', 'authority', 'control', 'patients', 'physically', 'mentally', 'also', 'authority', 'keep', 'insititution', 'ever', 'even', 'permanantly', 'disable', 'him.The', 'great', 'acting', 'will', 'keep', 'heart', 'ingaged', 'story', 'dream', 'friendship', 'sense', 'belonging', 'being', 'born', 'guys', 'High', 'prices', 'are', 'paid', 'reach', 'dream', 'dream', 'will', 'live', 'telling', 'story', 'Wire', 'briar', 'limber-lockThree', 'geese', 'flockOne', 'flew', 'east', 'one', 'flew', 'one', 'flew', 'Cuckoo', 'nest']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
99396,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,0790732181,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[0, 1]","After seeing the gorgeous Christian Slater in the stage production of this in Edinburgh, I just had to see it again (and compare the performances on stage, to on screen), and of course, any excuse to review it.This is one of the best 70s films ever - and that's saying something from me, as normally, apart from the rare one, I don't like them. And I'm not normally keen on Jack Nicholson - although I may be getting a minor thing for Christian Slater now. (Guess what that means? Buying all his DVDs!) But for some reason, all the characters in this are wonderful, including the weird-eyebrowed Randall P McMurphy! Others in this include: the up-tight and eccentric Harding (William Redfield), the stuttering Billy Bibbitt (Brad Dourif, who some might recognise, seemingly reprising his role later in the first Urban Legend movie), the innocently child-like Martini (Danny DeVito), and Taber (Christopher Lloyd), all of whom find themselves strangely drawn to the infectious wild nature of McMurphy, who opens their eyes to the joy of life, and in the defining moment of the film, explains that they've been convinced they're crazy, and are no less ordinary than the wackos who roam the streets outside their nest.If you've seen Girl Interrupted, then this is basically the same, but full of guys, some right, some not, and many of the extras in the background are actual mental patients.The film is actually based on a book by Ken Kesey, albeit, not a very good book, as I couldn't get my head around it, and put it down after a couple of pages. Ken Kesey said he would never watch the movie version and even sued the movie's producers because it wasn't shown from Chief Bromden's perspective (as the novel is). Apparently, years later, he claimed to be lying in bed flipping through TV channels when he settled onto a late-night movie that looked sort of interesting, only to realize after a few minutes that it was this film. He then changed channels.Jack Nicholson is brilliant in this, despite the freaky eyebrows. He acts when he doesn't have any lines to say. If you just watch him during the group therapy session, his expressions are terrific, and he just reacts to everything so well.The film has some unforgettable moments. Who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance?In the stage production, apart from being gorgeous, Christian Slater had the same mannerisms as Jack Nicholson, and all the cast did brilliantly. McKenzie Crook (Gareth from The Office) played Billy, and although he didn't stutter as much, he played the part, and looked kinda cute at the same time - he suits his hair longer.The one thing I was disappointed in the stage production, was Christopher Lloyd's character not really being featured - I think his character was incorporated with another one. It's disappointing in the movie too, as he doesn't have that much screen time, but when he does, his face is so funny! I just have two things to say: ""PECULIAR!"" and the cigarette scene all by itself. When I first saw him in this (having practically grown up with the Back To The Future movies), I couldn't believe they were the same guy - he's really nice looking!There seems to be a lot of tension between Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher) and McMurphy, but I always think if McMurphy could have had his wicked way with her, he would have done! There was a lot of tension in scenes between them, I don't know whether anyone else noticed. But sometimes you just want them to rip each other's clothes off!The ending to this, I simply can't watch. I've seen it once, and that was enough for me. Like the ending of The Shining, it stays with you. The ending gets me very upset, although I feel it was the right thing to do. I'll watch the rest of the movie quite the thing, but as soon as the ending comes, I'll either hide, or go out the room. It's really powerful.The movie swept the Oscars in 1975, and is always a favourite among people who were around at the time. Consequently, it's one of my favourites, and would recommend it to anyone.Now, about Christian Slater - I've seen him in Hard Rain, Robin Hood, True Romance, what else do I need to get where he looks extra cute?!And another thing - whoever decided that Christian should go topless at least twice in the stage production is a genius!",4,"""Medication time, medication time""",1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,4385,"['seeing', 'gorgeous', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'stage', 'production', 'Edinburgh', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'again', 'compare', 'performances', 'stage', 'screen', 'course', 'excuse', 'review', 'it.This', 'one', 'best', '70s', 'films', 'ever', 'saying', 'something', 'normally', 'apart', 'rare', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', ""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'keen', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'may', 'be', 'getting', 'minor', 'thing', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'now', 'Guess', 'what', 'Buying', 'DVDs', 'reason', 'characters', 'are', 'wonderful', 'including', 'weird-eyebrowed', 'Randall', 'P', 'McMurphy', 'Others', 'include', 'up-tight', 'eccentric', 'Harding', 'William', 'Redfield', 'stuttering', 'Billy', 'Bibbitt', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'who', 'might', 'recognise', 'seemingly', 'reprising', 'role', 'later', 'first', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'movie', 'innocently', 'child-like', 'Martini', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Taber', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'whom', 'find', 'strangely', 'drawn', 'infectious', 'wild', 'nature', 'McMurphy', 'who', 'eyes', 'joy', 'life', 'defining', 'moment', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'convinced', ""'re"", 'crazy', 'are', 'less', 'ordinary', 'wackos', 'who', 'streets', 'nest.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'then', 'basically', 'same', 'full', 'guys', 'right', 'not', 'many', 'extras', 'background', 'are', 'actual', 'mental', 'patients.The', 'film', 'actually', 'based', 'book', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'albeit', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'book', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'put', 'down', 'couple', 'pages', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'said', 'would', 'never', 'watch', 'movie', 'version', 'even', 'sued', 'movie', 'producers', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'Chief', 'Bromden', 'perspective', 'novel', 'Apparently', 'years', 'later', 'claimed', 'be', 'lying', 'bed', 'flipping', 'TV', 'channels', 'when', 'settled', 'late-night', 'movie', 'looked', 'sort', 'interesting', 'only', 'realize', 'few', 'minutes', 'was', 'film', 'then', 'changed', 'channels.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'brilliant', 'freaky', 'eyebrows', 'when', ""n't"", 'have', 'lines', 'say', 'just', 'watch', 'group', 'therapy', 'session', 'expressions', 'are', 'terrific', 'just', 'everything', 'so', 'well.The', 'film', 'unforgettable', 'moments', 'Who', 'could', 'forget', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'icy', 'stare', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'smart-aleck', 'remarks', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'impressive', 'almost', 'entirely', 'silent', 'performance', 'stage', 'production', 'apart', 'being', 'gorgeous', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'had', 'same', 'mannerisms', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'cast', 'did', 'brilliantly', 'McKenzie', 'Crook', 'Gareth', 'Office', 'played', 'Billy', 'did', ""n't"", 'stutter', 'as', 'much', 'played', 'part', 'looked', 'kinda', 'cute', 'same', 'time', 'suits', 'hair', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'disappointed', 'stage', 'production', 'was', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'character', 'not', 'really', 'being', 'featured', 'think', 'character', 'was', 'incorporated', 'one', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'too', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'when', 'face', 'so', 'funny', 'just', 'have', 'two', 'things', 'say', 'PECULIAR', 'cigarette', 'scene', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'having', 'practically', 'grown', 'up', 'Back', 'Future', 'movies', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'were', 'same', 'guy', 'really', 'nice', 'looking', 'be', 'lot', 'tension', 'Nurse', 'Ratchet', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'McMurphy', 'always', 'think', 'McMurphy', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'wicked', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'lot', 'tension', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'else', 'noticed', 'sometimes', 'just', 'want', 'rip', 'other', 'clothes', 'ending', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'once', 'was', 'enough', 'ending', 'Shining', 'ending', 'very', 'upset', 'feel', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'rest', 'movie', 'quite', 'thing', 'as', 'soon', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'either', 'hide', 'go', 'out', 'room', 'really', 'powerful.The', 'movie', 'swept', 'Oscars', '1975', 'always', 'favourite', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'around', 'time', 'Consequently', 'one', 'favourites', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone.Now', 'Christian', 'Slater', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Hard', 'Rain', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'True', 'Romance', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'need', 'get', 'where', 'extra', 'cute', 'thing', 'whoever', 'decided', 'Christian', 'should', 'go', 'topless', 'least', 'twice', 'stage', 'production', 'genius']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I have seen many movies since then, of varying degrees of quality; but nevertheless, this one remains among the most poignant, and ranks, for me, in a category with a few select, carefully chosen films. Few movies have affected me so deeply and on so many levels as Milos Forman's ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''.The plot is deceptively simple, yet conceals a number of thought-provoking and disturbing concepts beneath the surface.A convict named Randall McMurphy (played with great gusto and characteristic swagger by Jack Nicholson) is transferred to a state mental hospital after feigning insanity in order to escape the drudgery of the work farm. The doctors at the hospital, particularly the head doctor, are aware that McMurphy is relatively sane (though ""dangerous"", as one put's it), yet nevertheless insist on detaining and ""examining"" him until his sanity is confirmed.McMurphy is bawdy and rebellious, and from the onset of his arrival attempts to liberate the hospital's inmates from the oppression of the tyrannical Nurse Ratched (played with blood-curdling iciness by Louise Fletcher; both Fletcher and Nicholson won Oscars for this movie, and deservedly so. Their performances capture perfectly the essence of their characters). McMurphy defies the authority of Nurse Ratched at every turn, gradually leading the patients, particularly a hulking ""deaf-mute"" Indian named Bromden, to greater personal freedom. The consequences of his actions, however, are ultimately tragic. I'll leave you to find out what happens in the end for yourself, though rest assured, it is profoundly shocking and terribly tragic, and if you have even a shred of human compassion you'll probably shed a tear or two (I cried heartily, which I rarely do, but that's just me).""One flew over the Cuckoo's nest"", adapted from a popular 1960s Ken Kesey novel of the same name, is one of my favorite films.  The tone is perfect (though many of the book's hallucinogenics have been, understandably, left out) the directing of Milos Forman (director of ""Amadeus"", another of my favorite films) is beyond criticism, the performances are all spot on, the characters are three-dimensional human beings instead of over simplified caricatures, and the plot is compelling. The only thing approaching criticism which I have in regards to this movie is that the book is a somewhat more cerebral experience.I'm not quite sure what it is, aside from some of the more obvious aspects, but something about ""Cuckoo's nest"" really connects to some deeply rooted part of my psyche. Perhaps it is related in someway to the desire lurking inside all of us for rebellion against ""the system""; the successive ""victories"" McMurphy scores against Nurse Ratched are thrilling, and make you literally tremble with excitement at the prospect of her downfall, even when the outcome is known.Still, ""Cuckoo's nest"" isn't for everyone. Some may find the element's of the story too downbeat and depressing to fully enjoy; but nevertheless I give it full credit for turning me into the raging hellion I am today.

The barrage of acclaim and Forman's direction do the movie a  great dis-service becuase they make out the film to be something much more  than it is. This should have been a much simpler movie, one about a convict  in mental institution, not A MESSIAH FREEING SOULS FROM THE TYRANNY OF  ESTABLISHMENT. We should have seen what the bathrooms look like in the  hospital, what kind of food they eat, the human struggle against maddness.  Instead we get R.P. McMurphy taking the patients on fishing trips, playing  unplayable basketball games all supposedly representing the unbreakable  will of the human heart. All this ofcourse is very entertaining, but its  also stretching to make a point rather then let events unfold, and let the  viewer develop a profound response from which he/she can reach these  conclusions. Take for example The Shawshank Redemption(a superior film),  that film is patient with its evnts, it doesn't push its messages and as a  result it is much more moving. I don't mean to suggest that Cuckoo's Nest  is in anyway a bad film, I have merely gone out of my way to point out that  it would have been that much better on a smaller simpler scale.

Nicholson is in his career-best role as R.P McMurphy, a mischeivous scamp with a penchant for gambling and fun, who decides pretending to be insane beats a stretch in the pen. While there he meets the silently monsterous Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who has the other patients in her pocket. McMurphy takes it upon himself to fight against the regime the others have become institutionalised to. It seems to have inspired fantastic performances from all of the cast some of whom have become A-list stars like Danny De-Vito.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[4, 5]","Jack Nicholson's Oscar winning performance as Randle Patrick McMurphy is one of many highlights of this 1975 adaptation of the Ken Kesey novel.  Nicholson's McMurphy is a new inmate in a psychiatric ward who quickly rebels against the oppressive staff (which is personified by Nurse Ratched; played by Louise Fletcher in her Oscar winning role) while making quite an impact on his fellow inmates.  Director Milos Forman populates the film with memorable sequences while the screenplay offers many memorable, and in some cases unforgettable, characters; but none can steal the thunder of Jack Nicholson in the role he was born to play.  The rest of the cast includes Brad Dourif (in his film debut), Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, William Refield, Scatman Crothers, and an unforgettable Will Sampson as people you won't soon forget; and all of whom give superb performances.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest went on to sweep the Oscar's for all the major award categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay) while it solidified itself as a true masterpiece of film.  The film itself hasn't aged a day, and is still as much of a classic today as it was when first released almost thirty years ago.

What a shame, then, that this masterpiece is  presented so poorly on the much trumpeted 'superior' format.  More on that  later.  There isn't much to say about this film that you haven't heard  already.  Director Milos Forman paints a savage picture of 1970s America,  using the mental hospital setting as an allegory for a country that didn't  know its arse from its elbow.  There is much mirth to be enjoyed as Jack  Nicholson's McMurphy navigates his way around the two-faced, manipulative  institution, playing those in charge at their own game.  Forman skillfully  turns the tone on its head as McMurphy loses an unwinnable battle; his  pointless and tragic end is heartbreaking.  What strikes me most Cuckoo's  Nest is how such a powerful film could be so damn entertaining - and funny.  It's infuriating that Warner Bros put zero effort into giving this film  the DVD presentation it deserves.  The picture is no better than a good VHS  tape and the sound has to be turned right up to be listenable.  Unbelievably for an Oscar champion, there are no extra features of note.

About ten minutes into the film, when McMurphy's talking to the doctor about why he's there, McMurphy says 'I think we ought to get to the bottom of RP McMurphy'. This certainly happens by the end of the film.OFOACN (it's as difficult to abbreviate the title as it is to write it out) is plainly shot but smooth. The colouring is bleak and drab. It's like when you come out of a cinema, where you've just seen a special effects film, and you see the colour of real life.It's a film about breaking the rules (like Brando's The Wild One) but it's also hilarious.

Nicholson is not the kind of guy to play by the rules, not even to get out of this place, and the more he acts out against the cold attitude of the authorities (Nurse Ratched, in particular, whose name has become synonymous with cruel and implacable persons in authority), the more his fate is sealed.This fantastic movie, which swept the 1976 Oscars in every main category, is based on Milos Forman's book of the same name. Like the book, the film is filled with memorable characters, and it's hard to believe that they're even acting. In many places, the movie takes on the feel of a documentary; it's that realistic and well-acted.An iconic and classic movie that will last forever.

All these years, I could still remember vividly the Chief (the Indian that was as big as a tree trunk)and the anti-establishment McMurphy (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson).  It's like walking down the memory lane when I gotten myself the DVD rendition of the movie.  With advent of digital and Dolby technologies, now I am able to appreciate this movie in its full glory.  This is one of those movies that typified the triumph of the human spirits, about those rare individuals who are courageous enough to go against the grain.  What made this offering special is that this new version contains more than ten deleted scenes; behind-the-scenes where the older Danny De Vito, Christopher Lloyd, Bo Goldman, Saul Zaents, Milos Forman, Michael Douglas, Christine Fletcher talked reflectively and candidly about their involvements.  It's rather intriguing to know the effort that they went into just to source the Indian; Milos Forman comparing this movie with his ex-country Czech where people lived under the repressive regime and thus, him being the right Director for the movie; the hardship in trying to find a backer to finance this movie; Burt Reynolds was in contention to play McMurphy's character and so forth.  Over the years, this movie hasn't aged a bit and it still manages to captivate this very humane story.  Now with all these additions, it makes it a more worthwhile investment to revisit our memory yet again.  At times, old wine does get better with age.  If not been preserved correctly, as you know better, wine would be transformed into vinegar. In this instance, it doesn't happen.

It was the first film since &#34;It Happened One Night&#34; (1934) to win all five of the top Academy Awards, for best picture, actor (Nicholson), actress (Louise Fletcher), director (Milos Forman) and screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman).Roger EbertThe film, 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' is based on Ken Kesey's 1962 best-selling novel, &#34;contained the prophetic essence of the whole Vietnam period of revolutionary politics going psychedelic&#34;, as stated by Pauline Kael.The movie's portrays a simple approach. Mcmurphy reminds me of my best friend, a free spirit in a closed system. The free spirit in this case is Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is one of the high points in his career. Jack is a beloved star, an actor who is male. He gets away with things because he knows how to.Nurse Ratched, Louise Fletcher, plays an inflexible woman and nurse. She must be in control of everything and everybody.&#34;The film is known as an anti-establishment parable, but achieves its success by deliberately choosing to use the mental patients as comic caricatures. This decision leads to the fishing trip, which is at once the most popular, and the most false, scene in the movie. It is McMurphy's great joyous thumb in the eye to Ratched and her kind, but the energy of the sequence cannot disguise the unease and confusion of men who, in many cases, have no idea where they are, or why.&#34; Pauline KaelThrough-out the film I had two recurring thoughts. What is really going on in McMurphy's mind, and how much different and how much alike this mental institution is than the one where I received my mental health nursing education. In my estimation the film revolves around what McMurphy is thinking and then, how he acts out on those thoughts. The amazing reality is that the treatment works for McMurphy, who'd a thunk it? One of the last scenes where McMurphy is lying on the floor, thinking. Has he given up? I felt a great deal of ambivalence about him, because I did not know whether to laugh or cry. The antagonism between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy is pa;pable. She is straight-laced, and he is a free spirit.Highly, Highly Recommended. prisrob",5,Free Spirits In A Closed System,1186531200,"08 8, 2007",2007,2264,"['34', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', '34', '1975', 'list', 'favorite', 'films', 'was', 'first', 'film', '34', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', '34', '1934', 'win', 'five', 'top', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'best', 'picture', 'actor', 'Nicholson', 'actress', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'director', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'screenplay', 'Lawrence', 'Hauben', 'Bo', 'Goldman', '.Roger', 'EbertThe', 'film', ""'One"", 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'based', 'Ken', 'Kesey', '1962', 'best-selling', 'novel', '34', 'contained', 'prophetic', 'essence', 'whole', 'Vietnam', 'period', 'revolutionary', 'politics', 'going', 'psychedelic', '34', 'stated', 'Pauline', 'Kael.The', 'movie', 'portrays', 'simple', 'approach', 'Mcmurphy', 'best', 'friend', 'free', 'spirit', 'closed', 'system', 'free', 'spirit', 'case', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Nicholson', 'performance', 'one', 'high', 'points', 'career', 'Jack', 'beloved', 'star', 'actor', 'who', 'male', 'away', 'things', 'how', 'to.Nurse', 'Ratched', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'inflexible', 'woman', 'nurse', 'must', 'be', 'control', 'everything', 'everybody.', '34', 'film', 'known', 'anti-establishment', 'parable', 'success', 'deliberately', 'choosing', 'use', 'mental', 'patients', 'comic', 'caricatures', 'decision', 'fishing', 'trip', 'once', 'most', 'popular', 'most', 'false', 'scene', 'movie', 'McMurphy', 'great', 'joyous', 'thumb', 'eye', 'Ratched', 'kind', 'energy', 'sequence', 'can', 'not', 'disguise', 'unease', 'confusion', 'men', 'who', 'many', 'cases', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'are', 'why.', '34', 'Pauline', 'film', 'had', 'two', 'recurring', 'thoughts', 'What', 'really', 'going', 'McMurphy', 'mind', 'how', 'much', 'different', 'how', 'much', 'mental', 'institution', 'one', 'where', 'received', 'mental', 'health', 'nursing', 'education', 'estimation', 'film', 'around', 'what', 'McMurphy', 'thinking', 'then', 'how', 'out', 'thoughts', 'amazing', 'reality', 'treatment', 'McMurphy', 'who', ""'d"", 'thunk', 'One', 'last', 'scenes', 'where', 'McMurphy', 'lying', 'floor', 'thinking', 'given', 'up', 'felt', 'great', 'deal', 'ambivalence', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'laugh', 'cry', 'antagonism', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'McMurphy', 'pa', 'pable', 'straight-laced', 'free', 'spirit.Highly', 'Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
99435,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,0790732181,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[2, 2]","Based upon the 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, the book, along with this great film, is said to be some kind of social commentary, being a clash of the establishment and rebellion.  Some people say that this movie is merely just a footnote of the times.  I disagree.  In 2009, I can watch this movie and understand it greatly, and I can still appreciate this movie's many little sayings on various human qualities (according to the reviewer, the novel is more trippy or something.  Beats me).  Oh, and it also has fun and freshness thanks to the many quirky characters (hey, it's a mental hospital!).Unlike what other people say, I don't think this movie is really a product of it's time.  Such themes as sadism, supression, and other means of control are nothing new, things that are probably just human nature and happen all the time.  People who get great pleasure from controlling others who are inferior regarding mental strength is nothing exclusive to the early 60's.  Teachers these days sometimes do it to kids.  Roommates can do it to another roommate.  Observing others, and you will most definitely find many elements of human nature.  I agree with Jim Emerson in that the characters actions are all human nature, not just the mindset of it's times.This also is a character study that I don't mind studying at all.  These kind of characters are quirky, totally likeable, with tons of traits that make you feel emotions for these characters portrayed on screen (being fictional, no less).  They do it with ease.  Randal McMurphy is a rebel who is likeable, and I feel that Nurse Ratched is a despicable human being, with no sympathy toward her.  These two central people fight for their own beliefs, and it's great to see Ratched's tryannical and slightly sadistic and cruel iron fist slowly go down in a vain attempt to stop the rebel.  Sidestepping the battle between the two, the rest of the ward is just as good, with the same kind of traits.  The Chief is a noble, interesting, and mysterious man who really makes an impression.  You can learn a lot more by reading the book on this character (since the book is narrated from his eyes).  I also find quite al iking for Billy on a particular note, simply because I feel it's just so bad to have a mother who prevents her son from liking women (what a life that must be).  His demise in particular makes you wince when you think about it.I could go on and on, and while they don't feel like your friends or anything of that nature (I tend to only feel that way about Dazed and Confused), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest feels just like one of the classic stories where you love reading about them and the story, and don't feel like your falling victim to the 3rd person syndrome.I also think the directing is very nice, as well as the music and visuals.  Sure, this isn't a highly stylized picture of any sorts, in fact, the grainy picture (thanks to the picture of the DVD and the movie's old print, I think) makes it seem kind of flat, almost documentary looking style.  However, while that's cool, the directing is top notch, effortlessy made.  However, I think what also makes the movie look special is what he captures.  I think this guy captures some great shots, and there's nothing more.  Oregon is a beautiful state (this whole movie is shot on site), and the scene where he breaks the inmates out of feels is as refreshing on screen as it would be in real life.  The music makes the movie even more better.  Especially a scene such as described works wonders, because the music is light, and beautifully captures the whole moment of it.  Easy to see why Milos Forman got an Academy Award for Best Director, his 1st out of his 2nd Academy Award (Amadeus).I admit that I kind of beamed when I read ""Smashingly Effective, Emotionally Powerful"" from the late great Pauline Kael, hearing it from a critic such as that (she seems very opinionated and doesn't shower praise like some other critics).  I only thought the bad thing was the ending, which was good but not as good as the novel version.  While this movie may not quite live up to that, I feel that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to still be a film that has q bit of everything, including humor, some tragedy, some social commentary, and a place with people you would probably want to visit more than once.  This is an entertaining and powerful movie worth seeing again and again.B+",4,"Great Title, Greater Movie",1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,4404,"['Based', '1962', 'novel', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'book', 'great', 'film', 'said', 'be', 'kind', 'social', 'commentary', 'being', 'clash', 'establishment', 'rebellion', 'people', 'say', 'movie', 'merely', 'just', 'footnote', 'times', 'disagree', '2009', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'understand', 'greatly', 'can', 'still', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'many', 'little', 'sayings', 'various', 'human', 'qualities', 'according', 'reviewer', 'novel', 'more', 'trippy', 'something', 'Beats', 'Oh', 'also', 'fun', 'freshness', 'thanks', 'many', 'quirky', 'characters', 'hey', 'mental', 'hospital', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'really', 'product', 'time', 'Such', 'themes', 'sadism', 'supression', 'other', 'means', 'control', 'are', 'nothing', 'new', 'things', 'are', 'probably', 'just', 'human', 'nature', 'happen', 'time', 'People', 'who', 'get', 'great', 'pleasure', 'controlling', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'inferior', 'regarding', 'mental', 'strength', 'nothing', 'exclusive', 'early', '60', 'Teachers', 'days', 'sometimes', 'do', 'kids', 'Roommates', 'can', 'do', 'roommate', 'Observing', 'others', 'will', 'most', 'definitely', 'find', 'many', 'elements', 'human', 'nature', 'agree', 'Jim', 'Emerson', 'characters', 'actions', 'are', 'human', 'nature', 'not', 'just', 'mindset', 'times.This', 'also', 'character', 'study', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'studying', 'kind', 'characters', 'are', 'quirky', 'totally', 'likeable', 'tons', 'traits', 'make', 'feel', 'emotions', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'being', 'fictional', 'less', 'do', 'ease', 'Randal', 'McMurphy', 'rebel', 'who', 'likeable', 'feel', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'despicable', 'human', 'being', 'sympathy', 'two', 'central', 'people', 'fight', 'own', 'beliefs', 'great', 'see', 'Ratched', 'tryannical', 'slightly', 'sadistic', 'cruel', 'iron', 'fist', 'slowly', 'go', 'down', 'vain', 'attempt', 'stop', 'rebel', 'Sidestepping', 'battle', 'two', 'rest', 'ward', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'same', 'kind', 'traits', 'Chief', 'noble', 'interesting', 'mysterious', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'impression', 'can', 'learn', 'lot', 'more', 'reading', 'book', 'character', 'book', 'narrated', 'eyes', 'also', 'find', 'quite', 'al', 'iking', 'Billy', 'particular', 'note', 'simply', 'feel', 'just', 'so', 'bad', 'have', 'mother', 'who', 'son', 'liking', 'women', 'what', 'life', 'must', 'be', 'demise', 'particular', 'wince', 'when', 'think', 'it.I', 'could', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'friends', 'anything', 'nature', 'tend', 'only', 'feel', 'way', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'just', 'one', 'classic', 'stories', 'where', 'love', 'reading', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'falling', 'victim', '3rd', 'person', 'syndrome.I', 'also', 'think', 'directing', 'very', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'visuals', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'highly', 'stylized', 'picture', 'sorts', 'fact', 'grainy', 'picture', 'thanks', 'picture', 'DVD', 'movie', 'old', 'print', 'think', 'seem', 'kind', 'flat', 'almost', 'documentary', 'looking', 'style', 'However', 'cool', 'directing', 'top', 'notch', 'effortlessy', 'made', 'However', 'think', 'what', 'also', 'movie', 'look', 'special', 'what', 'think', 'guy', 'great', 'shots', 'nothing', 'more', 'Oregon', 'beautiful', 'state', 'whole', 'movie', 'shot', 'site', 'scene', 'where', 'inmates', 'feels', 'refreshing', 'screen', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'music', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'better', 'Especially', 'scene', 'such', 'described', 'wonders', 'music', 'light', 'beautifully', 'whole', 'moment', 'Easy', 'see', 'why', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'got', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Director', '1st', '2nd', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Amadeus', '.I', 'admit', 'kind', 'beamed', 'when', 'read', 'Smashingly', 'Effective', 'Emotionally', 'Powerful', 'late', 'great', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'hearing', 'critic', 'such', 'very', 'opinionated', ""n't"", 'shower', 'praise', 'other', 'critics', 'only', 'thought', 'bad', 'thing', 'was', 'ending', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'novel', 'version', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'feel', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'still', 'be', 'film', 'q', 'bit', 'everything', 'including', 'humor', 'tragedy', 'social', 'commentary', 'place', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'want', 'visit', 'more', 'once', 'entertaining', 'powerful', 'movie', 'seeing', 'again', 'again.B+']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

99446,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,0790732181,Robert J. Crawford,"[3, 9]","This is one of the great stories of the beat / acid rock generation.  The theme - the revolutionary fighting against injustice - is splendidly 60sish, naive in a way, but also extraordinarily vivid.  Of course, it is the characters who really make this, in Chief (the extraordinarily sensitive narrator of the novel) and of course, the hero Murphy.  But there are scores of others, so funny and tragic and human.Given my stellar experience with the book, I was really disappointed by this film.  It simply did not get the depth of the characters, in particular the chief, who the film makes just weird and whose behavior is incomprehensible when he escapes.  Moreover, Nicolson's Murphy was more a simple macho type hero, and had little of the self-serving ambiguity, the self-defeating anger, and yet with the surprising empathy from the novel - it just isn't anywhere near as nuanced a performance as he gave in say, 5 easy pieces or the last detail.I know I will be in the minority here, but seriously, I recommend reading the novel.  Its complexity, its characters, and the beauty of its prose make the shortcut of a film virtually impossible in my opinion.  This film just doesn't make it.  It is too hollywood and neatly packaged, too rowdy when it should have been tragic, and lacking the sparkling inner life and insights of the chief.

99447,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0790732181,Robert Morris,"[2, 2]","If I recall correctly, Kirk Douglas tried for many years to produce a film based on Ken Kesey's novel. He failed but son Michael succeeded and as its producer, accepted the Academy Award for the best film of 1975. Nicholson and Fletcher also received Oscars for best actor and best actress, respectively. The focal point of the film is, of course, Randle P. McMurphy (Nicholson) who may or may not deserve to be confined in an insane asylum ruled (in effect) by nurse Mildred Ratched (Fletcher). When I think about Nurse Ratched, I am reminded of an observation by Thelonious Monk: ""You know what's the loudest noise in the world, man? The loudest noise in the world is silence."" Given her absolute authority, she almost never says anything whereas McMurphy almost immediately becomes the unofficial (and self-appointed) spokesman for the other inmates. His confrontations with Ratched are inevitable. The resolution of their final conflict is among the most chilling revelations I have ever experienced in a film. Perhaps I should have seen it coming but I didn't.Oddly, much of the narrative involves several activities which are quite entertaining and even hilarious. For example, somehow McMurphy manages to flee the asylum with the other inmates, arranging so that he and they can take a day cruise with some of McMurphy's ""friends."" Of course the inmates thoroughly enjoy themselves. He also organizes basketball games in which the key player is Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), a Native American who never speaks and who seems to be at least ten feet tall. But there are other moments which are quite serious, indeed tragic. Brad Dourif deserved his nomination for an Academy Award for supporting actor (in the role of Billy Bibbit) and all others in the supporting cast are also first-rate. When I first saw this film, the character Martini caught my eye so I waited for the credits to learn the name of the actor who played him: Danny DeVito.Nicholson and Fletcher are brilliant. I've always thought hers to be the more difficult role because it places more limits on her talents than Nicholson's does on his. Stated another way, the McMurphy part gives Nicholson more opportunities to use those remarkable talents. Also, Nicholson's personality seems comparable with McMurphy's in certain respects (e.g. spontaneous, impish, confrontational, playful, quick-witted) whereas it is inconceivable to me that, other than gender, Fletcher and Ratched have anything in common.Kirk Douglas has never missed an opportunity to say how proud he is of son Michael's career and especially of what he achieved as producer of this film. Yes, those are the sentiments of a father but Kirk Douglas has also had a very distinguished career of his own as a producer, director, and actor. He understands better than does almost anyone else what is required to create a great film such as this.",5,"Ah Randle, ah humanity!",1058400000,"07 17, 2003",2003,2880,"['recall', 'correctly', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'tried', 'many', 'years', 'produce', 'film', 'based', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'novel', 'failed', 'son', 'Michael', 'succeeded', 'producer', 'accepted', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'film', '1975', 'Nicholson', 'Fletcher', 'also', 'received', 'Oscars', 'best', 'actor', 'best', 'actress', 'respectively', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'course', 'Randle', 'P.', 'McMurphy', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'confined', 'insane', 'asylum', 'ruled', 'effect', 'nurse', 'Mildred', 'Ratched', 'Fletcher', 'When', 'think', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'am', 'reminded', 'observation', 'Thelonious', 'Monk', 'know', 'what', 'loudest', 'noise', 'world', 'man', 'loudest', 'noise', 'world', 'silence', 'absolute', 'authority', 'almost', 'never', 'anything', 'whereas', 'McMurphy', 'almost', 'immediately', 'unofficial', 'self-appointed', 'spokesman', 'other', 'inmates', 'confrontations', 'Ratched', 'are', 'inevitable', 'resolution', 'final', 'conflict', 'most', 'chilling', 'revelations', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', ""didn't.Oddly"", 'much', 'narrative', 'several', 'activities', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'even', 'hilarious', 'example', 'somehow', 'McMurphy', 'flee', 'asylum', 'other', 'inmates', 'arranging', 'so', 'can', 'take', 'day', 'cruise', 'McMurphy', 'friends', 'course', 'inmates', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'also', 'basketball', 'games', 'key', 'player', 'Chief', 'Bromden', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'Native', 'American', 'who', 'never', 'speaks', 'who', 'be', 'least', 'ten', 'feet', 'tall', 'are', 'other', 'moments', 'are', 'quite', 'serious', 'indeed', 'tragic', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'Academy', 'Award', 'supporting', 'actor', 'role', 'Billy', 'Bibbit', 'others', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'first-rate', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'character', 'Martini', 'caught', 'eye', 'so', 'waited', 'credits', 'learn', 'name', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Danny', 'DeVito.Nicholson', 'Fletcher', 'are', 'brilliant', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'hers', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'role', 'more', 'limits', 'talents', 'Nicholson', 'Stated', 'way', 'McMurphy', 'part', 'Nicholson', 'more', 'opportunities', 'use', 'remarkable', 'talents', 'Also', 'Nicholson', 'personality', 'comparable', 'McMurphy', 'certain', 'respects', 'e.g', 'spontaneous', 'impish', 'confrontational', 'playful', 'quick-witted', 'inconceivable', 'other', 'gender', 'Fletcher', 'Ratched', 'have', 'anything', 'common.Kirk', 'Douglas', 'never', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'say', 'how', 'proud', 'son', 'Michael', 'career', 'especially', 'what', 'achieved', 'producer', 'film', 'Yes', 'are', 'sentiments', 'father', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'distinguished', 'career', 'own', 'producer', 'director', 'actor', 'better', 'almost', 'anyone', 'else', 'what', 'required', 'create', 'great', 'film', 'such']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

LARRY FLINT, focus on what he perceives as essential American qualities: its talent, its racism, its perversions, its freedoms, its inventiveness, and, in the case od ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, its strength of spirit. Jack Nicholson's McMurphy is a criminal, and Forman doesn't hide or sweeten this fact. It's his original sin, so to speak. But the world he is cast into is filled with darker sins: brutality, prejudice, ignorance, and inflexibility. McMurphy initially tries to serve just himself, but in his own way, he reaches out to the other inmates. Maybe not with the greatest of patience, he tries to inform the others that they are not crazy and that all is not lost. And he gives them some strengths that they didn't know they possessedPhenomenal performances are all over the place: Nicholson will forever be inseparable from McMurphy, as Louise Fletcher will always be Nurse Ratched. But the supporting performances were equally stellar. Will Sampson as the sad-eyed hulk, Chief, was exceptional. But for my money, Brad Dourif's Billy Bibbit is the overlooked gem of a performance. He is the pathetic and forlorn stutterer who befriends McMurphy, and, perhaps for that reason, suffers the most.

Aside from that false judgement, I was biased against the movie because of the era in which it was made. As a classic film fan, it is sometimes difficult not to resent some of the films that helped Hollywood progress away from the traditions of the classic era. However, any way you look at this movie, it is hard not to recognize the quality of the story and of the actors' performances.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a film about a man Randle (Jack Nicholson) who is sent to a mental institution to be evaluated because of his behavior in jail. The doctors think he could be faking insanity in order to avoid the rest of his jail time, but he keeps them guessing with strange behavior. Randle becomes friends with the men in the ward, a diverse group including a young man with a stutter named Brad Dourif (Billy Bibbit), a deaf and dumb Indian called Chief (Will Sampson), a rigid man named Harding (William Redfield), and a hyperactive Italian called Martini (Danny deVito). Randle helps these men to fight back against the abusive power of the nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) causing trouble for everyone but giving them a sense of idenity and happiness.This is a long film, but it is very emotional and powerful. Nicholson makes his character likable but appropriately flawed. Dourif presents his character innocently and sweetly like a little brother one needs to protect. Sampson is excellent as the Chief, one of the most interesting characters in the film. The ending to the movie is unsettling and sad, but it is thought-provoking and a wonderful finish to this film.",4,With a Punch,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,1697,"['was', 'always', 'impression', 'film', 'was', 'comedy', 'was', 'very', 'mistaken', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'anyway', 'Aside', 'false', 'judgement', 'was', 'biased', 'movie', 'era', 'was', 'made', 'classic', 'film', 'fan', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'not', 'resent', 'films', 'helped', 'Hollywood', 'progress', 'away', 'traditions', 'classic', 'era', 'However', 'way', 'look', 'movie', 'hard', 'not', 'recognize', 'quality', 'story', 'actors', 'performances.One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'film', 'man', 'Randle', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'sent', 'mental', 'institution', 'be', 'evaluated', 'behavior', 'jail', 'doctors', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'faking', 'insanity', 'order', 'avoid', 'rest', 'jail', 'time', 'guessing', 'strange', 'behavior', 'Randle', 'friends', 'men', 'ward', 'diverse', 'group', 'including', 'young', 'man', 'stutter', 'named', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Billy', 'Bibbit', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'Indian', 'called', 'Chief', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'rigid', 'man', 'named', 'Harding', 'William', 'Redfield', 'hyperactive', 'Italian', 'called', 'Martini', 'Danny', 'deVito', 'Randle', 'men', 'fight', 'back', 'abusive', 'power', 'nurse', 'Ratched', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'causing', 'trouble', 'everyone', 'giving', 'sense', 'idenity', 'happiness.This', 'long', 'film', 'very', 'emotional', 'powerful', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'likable', 'appropriately', 'flawed', 'Dourif', 'character', 'innocently', 'sweetly', 'little', 'brother', 'one', 'protect', 'Sampson', 'excellent', 'Chief', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'film', 'ending', 'movie', 'unsettling', 'sad', 'thought-provoking', 'wonderful', 'finish', 'film']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

It burns with the intensity of human struggle against oppression, showing how strong, how fragile, and how precious the spark of freedom and dignity is even in what might seem the most unlikely place for it, a mental institution.Jack Nicholson, who won a well deserved Oscar for the role, plays a convict of mixed character who thinks he can game the system but gets in over his head.  His erratic behavior has gotten him transfered from a prison work farm to a mental hospital, which he appears to see as an easier place to serve his time.  Initially careless and arrogant in his dealing with both staff and patients, he comes to care about his fellow inmates, some there voluntarily.  Partly on their behalf he becomes locked into a battle of wills with the domineering, cold Nurse Ratched, who effectively controls the hospital (Louise Fletcher, who also won an Oscar for her role).  While much of the film plays as comedy, the overall frame is that of tragedy mixed with ambiguous victory.  It's easy to see political/social/philosophical context and implications, worth reflecting on, but the basic humanity of the story is central.Besides the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Direction (Milos Forman), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman, from the novel by Ken Kesey).The new Blu-ray DVD will carry the same special features as the SD Special Edition:-- audio commentary with director Milos Forman and producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz-- ""The Making of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" documentary (47 minutes)-- additional footage: McMurphy and Dr. Spivey, Chief Captured between Mops, Shaving Chief, Who's the Top Loony Here?, McMurphy Meets Nurse Ratched, First Group Therapy Session, A Bunch a Chickens at a Pecking Party, Mr. McMurphy, Where Are Your Clothes?-- theatrical trailerSpecs: 1.85:1 Widescreen 1080p Hi-Def, English Dolby Digital 5.1, French 1.0, Spanish 1.0, German 1.0, Italian 1.0, subtitles in English, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish.  Extras are in standard definition.Hi def is always nice, but this isn't a film that requires high definition to be fully enjoyed, I think, and the SD Special Edition has good video and sound, so if you already have the Special Edition or can get it more cheaply than the Blu-ray, you might like it just about as well.By the way, this film is often compared to Cool Hand Luke, which has some similar themes.

Randall McMurphy (Niholson, perfect for the cocky con role)opts to go to an asylum instead of prison...BIG mistake! He shakes things up, and makes a lot of friends with the inmates, but a terrible enemy in the form of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). Nurse Ratched haunted me for years after I first saw this movie...she is one of the most terrifying characters ever to come down the pike. McMurphy challenges her authority (and in the process, greatly underestimates her capacity for pure evil)and her little kingdom, of which she is total ruler...he would have been better off to challenge a serial killer in jail! Her malignant manipulation of poor Billy...one of the most satisfying scenes was when Nicholson was strangling her. Too bad he didn't get to finish! Jack Nicholson turned in on of his best performances (this and Chinatown, my personal favorites). The Indian, called Chief, Martini and all the supporting cast were fabulous. LOVED the fishing trip! When McMurphy comes back the first time, and pretended to be lobotomized, he was great, as was the Chief's reaction...the next time...it was the real deal, and horrifying. My sole criticism is this: At the end, when the Chief is holding McMurphy, prior to putting him out of his misery, he should have remained silent. No words were necessary, the scene was powerful enough on it's own. What a great movie, though...the audience was absolutely soundless at the end...everyone was so moved they could not walk or speak for a few minutes...THAT is a sign of a great story.",5,Doesn't get much better than this,1067644800,"11 1, 2003",2003,1596,"['What', 'great', 'story', 'best', 'casting', 'make', 'perfect', 'Randall', 'McMurphy', 'Niholson', 'perfect', 'cocky', 'con', 'role', 'go', 'asylum', 'instead', 'prison', 'BIG', 'mistake', 'things', 'up', 'lot', 'friends', 'inmates', 'terrible', 'enemy', 'form', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'Ratched', 'haunted', 'years', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'terrifying', 'characters', 'ever', 'come', 'down', 'pike', 'McMurphy', 'authority', 'process', 'greatly', 'capacity', 'pure', 'evil', 'little', 'kingdom', 'total', 'ruler', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'challenge', 'serial', 'killer', 'jail', 'malignant', 'manipulation', 'poor', 'Billy', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'scenes', 'was', 'when', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'strangling', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'finish', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'turned', 'best', 'performances', 'Chinatown', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Indian', 'called', 'Chief', 'Martini', 'supporting', 'cast', 'were', 'fabulous', 'LOVED', 'fishing', 'trip', 'When', 'McMurphy', 'back', 'first', 'time', 'pretended', 'be', 'lobotomized', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'Chief', 'reaction', 'next', 'time', 'was', 'real', 'deal', 'horrifying', 'sole', 'criticism', 'end', 'when', 'Chief', 'holding', 'McMurphy', 'prior', 'putting', 'misery', 'should', 'have', 'remained', 'silent', 'words', 'were', 'necessary', 'scene', 'was', 'powerful', 'enough', 'own', 'What', 'great', 'movie', 'audience', 'was', 'absolutely', 'soundless', 'end', 'everyone', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'could', 'not', 'walk', 'speak', 'few', 'minutes', 'THAT', 'sign', 'great', 'story']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

99467,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,0790732181,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[11, 20]","INTERVIEWER : Hello, and welcome back to McCARTHY AT HOLLYWOOD AND VINE.  We're here today with Stephen T. McCarthy and discussing one of his very favorite films, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.  Tell us, Stephen, when did you first see this highly acclaimed film?McCARTHY : CUCKOO'S NEST was released in nineteen seventy-five, and I saw it numerous times at The Avco Cinema Center in Los Angeles.  I and a group of friends - some who later went on to become police officers - sneaked into the theatre repeatedly during its initial run.  To this day, it remains entrenched on my all-time Top Ten movie list.INTERVIEWER : Stephen, you little criminal, we never would have thought it of you.  I understand that you have a rather original perspective on this classic film.  Want to share that with us?McCARTHY : Well, back in seventy-five, I thought I was just viewing a magnificently crafted and masterfully acted film centered on the important theme of individualism and finding, and being true to, one's own voice.  I had no way of knowing that the movie was actually remarkably prescient with regards to the American political situation that would manifest over thirty years later.INTERVIEWER : Would you care to elaborate?McCARTHY : To the viewer in nineteen seventy-five, this movie, which won five Academy Awards, appeared to tell the story of a man who feigns mental illness in order to avoid his prison work detail.  While he is undergoing psychiatric evaluation, his rebellious, individualistic spirit ""infects"" the real ""nut cases"" who begin to assert themselves much to the resentment of the domineering head nurse at the mental institution.  But here in aught six, we can see that the movie was actually foretelling the political situation that this country now finds itself in.INTERVIEWER : To you, the characters in this movie represent something completely different, don't they?McCARTHY : Yes.  Actually, CUCKOO'S NEST is about the 2008 Presidential Election.  The mental institution itself symbolizes the United States - a loony bin if there ever was one.  The domineering, manipulative, and vindictive head nurse, Mildred Ratched, represents Hillary Clinton - a power-hungry woman driven by her insatiable quest for control.  It should be pointed out that Louise Fletcher won an Oscar for her remarkable portrayal of Ms. Clinton.  Capturing every aspect of the senator's traits, she paints us as good a portrait of Clinton as Clinton herself could have done.INTERVIEWER :  But the senator's road to The White House is not without obstacles, is it?McCARTHY :  No.  Standing in her way is the rebellious underdog, Randle Patrick McMurphy, a man who seeks to bring the nuts around him back to their senses.  McMurphy personifies the true American spirit opposed to the Socialism of Nurse Ratched.  There is one scene in particular that forcefully illustrates this friction: McMurphy petitions to have the television in the community room turned on so that he and his fellow Americans - or ""the mental defective league"", as he accurately refers to them - can watch the second game of the 1963 World Series.  Baseball, being ""America's Pastime"", is naturally repugnant to the Leftist Nurse, and so she resorts to her unique brand of sophism in order to prevent genuinely American traditions from being broadcasted into the community (room).INTERVIEWER : And Nurse Ratched is aided and abetted by--McCARTHY : She is voted into power and protected by women and minorities.  This is conveyed by her ever-present subordinate female nurse and by the mental institution's watchful and protective orderlies.  Ratched's eventual success in quashing all sense of individualism and driving the country deeper into the pit of Socialism is ""shockingly"" revealed in the eventual castration of America's spirit, that being R. P. McMurphy; the castration, however, is thinly veiled by the fact that the scalpel is actually wielded against his ""Northern"" hemisphere.INTERVIEWER : Is there no happy ending here?McCARTHY : No, I'm afraid not.  With the true American spirit now impotent, Ms. Clinton occupies the ultimate position of power that she coveted, and the principles of Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, and George Mason - those formerly enduring ideals NATIVE to America -  ""fly the coop"", or leave the cuckoo's nest.  This is represented by the ""Native American"", Chief Bromden, who heads for the hills.INTERVIEWER : And isn't it true that-- Hey, wait, Stephen, where are you going?!McCARTHY : To pack my bags!  I'm afraid that Nurse Ratched really is going to win the 2008 election, and I also need to be ready to escape this insane country and ""head for the hills.""",5,'McCARTHY AT HOLLYWOOD AND VINE' (Episode #124),1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,4672,"['INTERVIEWER', 'Hello', 'welcome', 'back', 'McCARTHY', 'AT', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'AND', 'VINE', ""'re"", 'here', 'today', 'Stephen', 'T.', 'McCarthy', 'discussing', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'films', 'ONE', 'FLEW', 'THE', 'CUCKOO', 'NEST', 'Tell', 'Stephen', 'when', 'did', 'first', 'see', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'McCARTHY', 'CUCKOO', 'NEST', 'was', 'released', 'nineteen', 'seventy-five', 'saw', 'numerous', 'times', 'Avco', 'Cinema', 'Center', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'later', 'went', 'become', 'police', 'officers', 'sneaked', 'theatre', 'repeatedly', 'initial', 'run', 'day', 'entrenched', 'all-time', 'Top', 'Ten', 'movie', 'list.INTERVIEWER', 'Stephen', 'little', 'criminal', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'understand', 'have', 'rather', 'original', 'perspective', 'classic', 'film', 'Want', 'share', 'McCARTHY', 'Well', 'back', 'seventy-five', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'viewing', 'magnificently', 'crafted', 'masterfully', 'acted', 'film', 'centered', 'important', 'theme', 'individualism', 'finding', 'being', 'true', 'own', 'voice', 'had', 'way', 'knowing', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'remarkably', 'prescient', 'regards', 'American', 'political', 'situation', 'would', 'manifest', 'thirty', 'years', 'later.INTERVIEWER', 'Would', 'care', 'elaborate', 'McCARTHY', 'viewer', 'nineteen', 'seventy-five', 'movie', 'won', 'five', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'appeared', 'tell', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'mental', 'illness', 'order', 'avoid', 'prison', 'work', 'detail', 'undergoing', 'psychiatric', 'evaluation', 'rebellious', 'individualistic', 'spirit', 'infects', 'real', 'nut', 'cases', 'who', 'begin', 'assert', 'much', 'resentment', 'domineering', 'head', 'nurse', 'mental', 'institution', 'here', 'aught', 'six', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'foretelling', 'political', 'situation', 'country', 'now', 'in.INTERVIEWER', 'characters', 'movie', 'represent', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'McCARTHY', 'Yes', 'Actually', 'CUCKOO', 'NEST', '2008', 'Presidential', 'Election', 'mental', 'institution', 'United', 'States', 'loony', 'bin', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'domineering', 'manipulative', 'vindictive', 'head', 'nurse', 'Mildred', 'Ratched', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'power-hungry', 'woman', 'driven', 'insatiable', 'quest', 'control', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'won', 'Oscar', 'remarkable', 'portrayal', 'Ms.', 'Clinton', 'Capturing', 'aspect', 'senator', 'traits', 'good', 'portrait', 'Clinton', 'Clinton', 'could', 'have', 'done.INTERVIEWER', 'senator', 'road', 'White', 'House', 'not', 'obstacles', 'McCARTHY', 'Standing', 'way', 'rebellious', 'underdog', 'Randle', 'Patrick', 'McMurphy', 'man', 'who', 'bring', 'nuts', 'back', 'senses', 'McMurphy', 'true', 'American', 'spirit', 'opposed', 'Socialism', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'forcefully', 'friction', 'McMurphy', 'petitions', 'have', 'television', 'community', 'room', 'turned', 'fellow', 'Americans', 'mental', 'defective', 'league', 'accurately', 'can', 'watch', 'second', 'game', '1963', 'World', 'Series', 'Baseball', 'being', 'America', 'Pastime', 'naturally', 'repugnant', 'Leftist', 'Nurse', 'so', 'unique', 'brand', 'sophism', 'order', 'prevent', 'genuinely', 'American', 'traditions', 'being', 'broadcasted', 'community', 'room', '.INTERVIEWER', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'aided', 'abetted', 'McCARTHY', 'voted', 'power', 'protected', 'women', 'minorities', 'conveyed', 'ever-present', 'subordinate', 'female', 'nurse', 'mental', 'institution', 'watchful', 'protective', 'orderlies', 'Ratched', 'eventual', 'success', 'quashing', 'sense', 'individualism', 'driving', 'country', 'pit', 'Socialism', 'shockingly', 'revealed', 'eventual', 'castration', 'America', 'spirit', 'being', 'R.', 'P.', 'McMurphy', 'castration', 'however', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'fact', 'scalpel', 'actually', 'wielded', 'Northern', 'hemisphere.INTERVIEWER', 'happy', 'ending', 'here', 'McCARTHY', 'No', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'not', 'true', 'American', 'spirit', 'now', 'impotent', 'Ms.', 'Clinton', 'ultimate', 'position', 'power', 'coveted', 'principles', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Patrick', 'Henry', 'George', 'Mason', 'formerly', 'enduring', 'ideals', 'NATIVE', 'America', 'fly', 'coop', 'leave', 'cuckoo', 'nest', 'represented', 'Native', 'American', 'Chief', 'Bromden', 'who', 'hills.INTERVIEWER', ""n't"", 'true', 'Hey', 'wait', 'Stephen', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'McCARTHY', 'pack', 'bags', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'really', 'going', 'win', '2008', 'election', 'also', 'need', 'be', 'ready', 'escape', 'insane', 'country', 'head', 'hills']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
99468,AJN24TVEGZEI4,0790732181,Steve,"[0, 0]","This movie was a very well directed movie.  The dialogue was simply brilliant, hilarious and was perfect.  Additionally, the acting was amazing.  The persons playing the asylum inhabitants are phenomenal actors and are exceptionally convincing.  While the movie was beyond brilliant it was a little slow for my own taste.  It should be noted that the end is absolutely brilliant, is phenomenal and is heartbreaking all at the same time and the movie's ultimate climax is brilliantly directed and perfectly acted.  I absolutely love that they decided to make Mac steal the bus rather than get permission as he does in the book, this was a genius change and it made the movie that much better!  The other way does not fit his character, and is not in the spirit of Mac!The main character of this movie, Mac is absolutely awesome.  His personality is beyond entertaining and his commentary, attitude and beliefs are so spot on to reality.  He perfectly portrays a typical social misfit/criminal, who should have been in prison rather than in an asylum and who was misjudged by the very professionals and experts that were in charge.  Furthermore it should be noted that what makes the final conclusion so disturbing is that the doctor's themselves know what they are doing and know that he is not psychotic at all.The plot of the movie follows a man who was transferred from a prison work farm to an insane asylum.  While at the asylum he becomes the ""leader"" of a group of socially awkward and mentally disturbed patients.  While at the asylum he teaches them all kinds of destructive habits and ultimately works to undermine and rebel against the authority of the iron fisted nurse Rachted.  His final act of disobedience is the most hilarious, most ingenious bit of acting, and social commentary ever imagined, but such is quickly followed by a series of absolutely heart-wrenching scenes, all culminating in a brilliant ending.I really enjoyed this movie and I thought it was very well executed and acted.  Personally I took of one star because I found certain parts of it to be long and draggy giving me a ""hurry up and get this scene done already"" mentality.  Definitely get this movie, it is an absolute classic, you will not be disappointed.Jack Nicholson is brilliant in this movie!!",4,Review - One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,2289,"['movie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'was', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'hilarious', 'was', 'perfect', 'Additionally', 'acting', 'was', 'amazing', 'persons', 'playing', 'asylum', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'actors', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'convincing', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliant', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'own', 'taste', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'end', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'phenomenal', 'heartbreaking', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'ultimate', 'climax', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'perfectly', 'acted', 'absolutely', 'love', 'decided', 'make', 'Mac', 'steal', 'bus', 'rather', 'get', 'permission', 'book', 'was', 'genius', 'change', 'made', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'way', 'not', 'fit', 'character', 'not', 'spirit', 'Mac', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'Mac', 'absolutely', 'awesome', 'personality', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'attitude', 'beliefs', 'are', 'so', 'spot', 'reality', 'perfectly', 'typical', 'social', 'misfit/criminal', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'prison', 'rather', 'asylum', 'who', 'was', 'misjudged', 'very', 'professionals', 'experts', 'were', 'charge', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'what', 'final', 'conclusion', 'disturbing', 'doctor', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'know', 'not', 'psychotic', 'all.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'transferred', 'prison', 'work', 'farm', 'insane', 'asylum', 'asylum', 'leader', 'group', 'socially', 'awkward', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'patients', 'asylum', 'kinds', 'destructive', 'habits', 'ultimately', 'undermine', 'rebel', 'authority', 'iron', 'fisted', 'nurse', 'Rachted', 'final', 'act', 'disobedience', 'most', 'hilarious', 'most', 'ingenious', 'bit', 'acting', 'social', 'commentary', 'ever', 'imagined', 'such', 'quickly', 'followed', 'series', 'absolutely', 'heart-wrenching', 'scenes', 'culminating', 'brilliant', 'ending.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'acted', 'Personally', 'took', 'one', 'star', 'found', 'certain', 'parts', 'be', 'long', 'draggy', 'giving', 'hurry', 'up', 'get', 'scene', 'done', 'already', 'mentality', 'Definitely', 'get', 'movie', 'absolute', 'classic', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.Jack', 'Nicholson', 'brilliant', 'movie']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

99470,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,0790732181,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 3]","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)Drama, 133 minutesDirected by Milos FormanStarring Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad DourifJack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors and he can pull off anything from serious drama, to horror, or even comedy. I loved his portrayal of Melvin Udall in As Good as It Gets, but I think R. P. McMurphy is my favorite Nicholson character.McMurphy is placed in a mental institution for evaluation, but he's really just trying to avoid prison and hard work. We know that he's faking it the whole time. His fellow patients are a weird mixture of oddballs. Some are dangerous, others merely insecure. McMurphy discovers that most of the patients are there on a voluntary basis and he observes that they are no crazier than the average person on the street.There's a great scene when McMurphy arranges a road trip of sorts and we see how some of the others function when they are in the real world. It does raise an interesting point about mental illness. How much is a result of our environment? Can some of the problems be remedied simply by being placed in the right environment?The characters have plenty of depth and we gradually learn some of their hopes and fears. The best moment in the entire film involves Juicy Fruit, but I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen the film. If you have, you'll know exactly what I mean.McMurphy is perceived as subversive and potentially dangerous. When Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) refuses to show the World Series on TV, McMurphy whips the other patients into a frenzy by acting out an imaginary game.The acting talent on display is seriously good. You can see early performances from the likes of Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito, as well as Brad Dourif's breakout performance as Billy.The film contains a lot of humor as Nicholson pushes his role to the limit, but there are sad and frightening moments included in the mix. The mood can turn from peaceful to chaotic in the blink of an eye, and reflects the true nature of mental illness. The ending is particularly moving and can be considered both hopeful and desperately sad.According to IMDB, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest became the first film in 41 years to sweep the major categories of Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best (Adapted) Screenplay.

Aside from some minor bloodshed during a brawl and a patient's death, there are no real ""effects"" to be found in this movie except of course the effect of Nicholson in what must be one of his many top performances as RP MacMurphy. The movie shifts the focus from Chief's pont-of-view narrative to a broader look at all the patients, and it works incredibly well. It was a smart move on Forman's part because a 100% faithful adaption of the novel would have been either impossible or not interesting to anyone. Favorite scenes: when they are voting on changing the work schedule to watch a World Series game and Chief raises his hand to get a majority vote, the fishing trip, the group session when MacMurphy says to the others, ""what do you think you are, crazy or something?

Louise Fletcher is also perfectly cast as Nurse Ratched a ""healer"" who does far more harm than good and quickly becomes ""Mac's"" nemesis and ultimate doom.  One can't help but wonder what happened in this fictional nurse's history and personal life to create such a creature.  Yet it is the character actors, including young Christopher Lloyd and Danny De Vito, who play the mentally disturbed and retarded inmates, that really make this film involving and convince the viewer they are seeing a realistic depiction of a 1960's mental ward.For all the strengths of the film Ken Kesey's novel which is told from the viewpoint of Chief (clearly schizophrenic in the book) is much superior.  A Broadway revival, I saw, of the play (in about 2001?) with Gary Sinise was much closer to the message of the book as well as very memorable and moving.

This masterpiece is perfect in every sense of the word from the performances to the direction to the writing. ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is also one of those rare films that was nominated for every major Academy Award; it in turn won in all the top categories including being Best Picture of 1975.Jack Nicholson, in a flawless performance, plays a man signed into a mental hospital. His character, McMurphy, is not at all crazy, but he is put in this particular hospital to be evaluated after spending time on a state farm (jail). Once at the hospital McMurphy meets many patients as well as the rigid Nurse Ratchet. To say that McMurphy livens up the hospital as well as its inhibitants is an undersatement. The movie is hilarious, but at the same time touching as mental illness is explored in a humorous way.The DVD comes with a 47 minute documentary on the making of the film. Michael Douglas (one of the film's producers), Louise Fletcher, director Milos Forman, and others are all interviewed. Jack Nicholson, unfortunately, is not in the featurette. The film is a 2001 digital transfer from restored elements and there is a splendid commentary from Forman, Douglas, and Saul Zaentz.

Seay,"[0, 0]","Upon viewing this movie it becomes immediately apparent thatthe pathology resides even more in the doctors, nurses and administrators of the mental hospital than with the patients.As we get to know the patients, it occurs to us that most ofthem are just a bit eccentric and have been placed in this hospital -or in some cases have even placed themselves there -because society is intolerant of all those who can not neatly adapt tothe discipline of the 9 to 5 organization man and his protestant work ethic.  The hospital personnel intends to ""help"" people by making them good cogs in the machine.  To the extent that there is anything ""wrong"" with the patients, it is ""the machine"" and the ""help"" that has driven them to a poor state of being.  In other words, the medicine is not only worse than the disease, it IS the disease.Nurse Cratchett may even have good intentions, but she cannot tolerate individuality or other peoples desires...these must be controlled and follow the regulations to the letter.  She is your typical control ... and when McMurphy reacts violentlyto her mainacal control and evil consequences it has for the young stuttering patient, he is the one penalized, not her.  We all know a Nurse Cratchett...she tells us to become accountants instead of musicians. In fact, this mental hospital is a microcosm of society at large, a machine that wants to create false desires, distort or suppress true desires in order toperpetuate the socio-ecomomic machine as it is.Now Ken Kesey who wrote the novel upon which this movie was basedhad a first hand look at all of this.  He worked in a psychiatric ward when he was a graduate student at Stanford.He was also very concerned about the shackles placed on our minds, not necessarily by this or that individual, but as an epiphenomenon of our society.  He sought to break free of these shackles and, to that end started, the Merry Pranksters, travelling around America distributing LSD...as a means of liberating the mind.  I was happy to see in a documentary done for the history channel (The History of LSD) that he held this view of the liberatory nature of LSD to the end of his life.This classic film was a milestone in his evolution and must be seen by all generations to come.

Honestly , I felt like they gave me more than my money's worth.The &quot;extras&quot; section of the second dvd was worth the money in itself. Thanks, to all who put this package (2-discs) together. I guess they saw that the original dvd needed to be updated and treated with the same love that the fans have given the film , over the years. The remastered sound is excellent.The deleted scenes are wonderful to watch, especially if you've been a fan of this movie for years.It's also a pleasure to hear and see some of the stars relive the making of it , in the &quot;making of&quot; segment. The commentary from Milos Foreman and Michael Douglas provided pearls of info. and the gathering of details was placed together with utter perfection. The two disc series, covered every aspect from : the passing on of the screenplay, casting , filming activities , cast and crew information, and everything else that had to do with the production of the film ,that garnered several Academy Awards in '76. As for the movie , itself ? Jack Nicholson is a his best and is highlighted by all of the contrasting and equally estounding cast members.Particularly , the &quot;discovered ,regular guy&quot; turned actor that played Chief Bromden. Milos Foreman had the belief and foresight to give all of the actors improv space that provided a total creative freeforall. One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest provides modern cinema with some of the most unforgettable images ever captured on film and offers a pelithera of flawless acting, around a simple story ,that will take your attention and engulf you to the point of no return. This movie will effect you and leave you thinking about it ,for days afterwards. Am I gabbing too much ? Okay, well let me wrap my perspective of this movie, with a line uttered from the character of Aide Washington......&quot;outta sight , man.

they are all REAL people'and again during the fishing trip, he assigns to them specific jobs by telling them jockingly that 'now you're an expert sailor, not a loonie'.little by little, those patients start having back a taste of life, and one starts to question the means employed by mental institutions: there are many alternativesto brain melting drugs to mental cases and these alternatives include the very basicforms of entertainment, play, friendship and giving purpose back to the treated person.for me the whole movie culminates into one of the last scenes where nurse ratchedbusts the stuttering bibbit with candy: bibbit's stutter is gone during the night he spent with candy and he was again a normal person, with confidence. he was cured, by a very simple 'method', yet the nurse proceeds to destroy his newly found confidence by clubbing him with guilt. mc murphy is horrified at the true evil on display, as he sees the man he helped shed his stutter and lack of confidence, dismantled back into wimpdom. i found myself cheering for him when he leaped at nurse ratched's throat.the concepts displayed in this movie are timeless ones (leadership, play&humor;,conformity, individualism) and are played to perfection by a stellar cast. the result isa film that defies age and a permanent reference in hollywood's golden era cinemaand moviemaking in short.",5,a timeless classic,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,2419,"['previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mostly', 'said', 'was', 'be', 'said', 'thisgreat', 'film', 'i', 'do', 'agree', 'most', 'movie', 'doesnt', 'let', 'go', 'throughoutand', 'i', 'was', 'glued', 'seat', 'reveling', 'awesome', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'starting', 'always', 'great', 'danny', 'vito', 'christopher', 'lloyd', 'actor', 'who', ""'d"", 'give', 'looniest', 'performances', 'Back', 'Future', 'Who', 'framed', 'roger', 'Rabbit', 'up', 'otherworldly', 'showdown', 'nicholson', 'glacialalmost', 'satanic', 'louise', 'fletcher', 'hair', 'aptly', 'combed', 'vaguely', 'resemblecurved', 'horns.you', 'forget', 'murphy', 'nicholson', 'petty', 'criminal', 'who', 'avoiding', 'hard', 'labor', 'prison', 'when', 'see', 'injecting', 'life', 'back', 'heavily', 'sedated', 'ward', 'patients', 'thanks', 'mc', 'murphy', 'patients', 'brains', 'were', 'wrecked', 'powerful', 'drugs', 'were', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'cured', 'get', 'back', 'appreciating', 'life', 'playing', 'ball', 'fishing', 'having', 'identity', 'truly', 'memorable', 'part', 'when', 'nicholson', 'card', 'playing', 'inmate', 'wait', 'turn', ""'you"", 'see', 'people', 'here', 'are', 'REAL', ""people'and"", 'again', 'fishing', 'trip', 'specific', 'jobs', 'telling', 'jockingly', ""'now"", ""'re"", 'expert', 'sailor', 'not', ""loonie'.little"", 'little', 'patients', 'start', 'having', 'back', 'taste', 'life', 'one', 'question', 'means', 'employed', 'mental', 'institutions', 'are', 'many', 'alternativesto', 'brain', 'melting', 'drugs', 'mental', 'cases', 'alternatives', 'include', 'very', 'basicforms', 'entertainment', 'play', 'friendship', 'giving', 'purpose', 'back', 'treated', 'whole', 'movie', 'one', 'last', 'scenes', 'where', 'nurse', 'stuttering', 'bibbit', 'candy', 'bibbit', 'stutter', 'gone', 'night', 'spent', 'candy', 'was', 'again', 'normal', 'person', 'confidence', 'was', 'cured', 'very', 'simple', ""'method"", 'nurse', 'proceeds', 'destroy', 'newly', 'found', 'confidence', 'clubbing', 'guilt', 'mc', 'murphy', 'horrified', 'true', 'evil', 'display', 'man', 'helped', 'shed', 'stutter', 'lack', 'confidence', 'dismantled', 'back', 'wimpdom', 'i', 'found', 'cheering', 'when', 'leaped', 'nurse', 'ratched', 'throat.the', 'concepts', 'displayed', 'movie', 'are', 'timeless', 'ones', 'leadership', 'play', 'humor', 'conformity', 'individualism', 'are', 'played', 'perfection', 'stellar', 'cast', 'result', 'isa', 'film', 'age', 'permanent', 'reference', 'hollywood', 'golden', 'era', 'cinemaand', 'moviemaking', 'short']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

I grew up in the Soviet Union, and that is where I saw the movie for the first time, long after it was released in the States. Jack Nicholson played his role to perfection.This movie can be emotionally hard to watch. It depicts an insane asylum as a metaphor for totalitarian society. In such a society the notion of individual human dignity does not exist. The Big Nurse takes care of people's survival, but this survival is not much more than vegetation--the human spirit is broken. We see that people fall into the hands of such society, when their spirits are already at their lowest and they see no point in living actively and productively, but simply live out the rest of their days--physical survival is all that remains to them. Against this despiritualization and humiliation Jack Nicholson's character muster up his humor and his unruly ways. It is tragic, sad, and thoughtful. Yet the end is also hopeful.This movie is relevant for any country, for even in the most free society, there are people who are dead or are dying inside.

I could watch this movie a thousand times a day and NEVER get tired of it. There is so much cool sh*t going on with this film. If you are not familiar with my movie reviews, I love great quotes in film... This movie is chock full of 'em. Great acting galore from JACK NICHOLSON (he plays Randal P Mcmurphy, the best character a movie ever saw.) This film won him a best acting Oscar in 1976. The whole panel of ""mental defectives"" make great characters too, you may recognize CHRISTOPHER LLOYD and DANNY DEVITO in some of their earliest roles. Then there is that evil twisted bitch Nurse Ratched, played by my baby's momma (no actually she is played by LOUISE FLETCHER, who also won an Oscar for her role.)The premise of this thing is that MacMurphy is imprisoned on a work farm after being charged with statitory ""she was 15 going on 35, and she told me she was 18."" In order to get out of it, he pretends to be crazy. They believe him (he is at least a little nuts) and they send him to a psych ward. Here we meet the rest of the boys, who are all being twiddled around by this Nurse Ratched, who satisfies her power needs by basically keeping these guys crazy. Randy P catches on quick ""that nurse, she's something of a cun* ain't she?"" and decides to spread his free will around causing some immediate sparks between the two. Also we are introduced to the Chief, you'll have to see the movie to learn more about him.This movie touched me on every degree, and it ain't no sap either... it's hillarious all along the way. The end will make your head spin though, but lord is it good.I highly recommend this film. Jack Nicholsons hands down best role. I say one to have in your collection, because it deserves seeing a lot of times.Also the book. I had seen the movie a million times before I actually read the book and was suprised at how much BETTER the book was.

Nicholson does his best work and, let's face it, that alone says a lot for this film.  Everybody else does a wonderful job complimenting his zany character.  Louise Fletcher, a virtual unknown before the picture hit theaters, is  superb as the nurse who belittles her patients, allowing them no chance to  control their own lives.  This film is essentially about the war, both  psychologically and physically, that takes place between Nurse Ratchett and  troublemaking inmate Randal Patrick McMurphy.  As McMurphy begins to rule  the ward with reckless abandon, leading the mutiny of the other patients  against the oppressive forces within the hospital, the head nurse begins to  feel her power over them dwindling.  The disasters that come as a result of  this tension make for one of the best dramas ever put on screen.  One of  the most memorable scenes in film history takes place when McMurphy, upset  at the prospect of not being able to watch a World Series game on  television, begins announcing the game himself loud enough so that the  other members of the ward can hear him.

99502,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0790732181,Wuchak,"[2, 3]","""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it a few times when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't `get' a lot of the insights the film conveys. Viewing it again recently, I `got' it.Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the ""mental illness"" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their ""therapy"" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be ""dealt with.""A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched ""isn't that bad"" or that ""she was only trying to do her job"", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is absolutely demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.The filmmakers and Fletcher make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare this to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest,"" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).McMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (or rule). The problem with this is that ""appearances"" are not about reality and, worse, ""the letter kills.""Despite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a decade. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, yet only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end of the film because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it requires mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of Chief, played effectively by Will Sampson.The film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.GRADE: A",5,The spirit of freedom vs. the spirit of legal-ism,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,4283,"['One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', '1975', 'film', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'more', 'mature', 'saw', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'insights', 'film', 'conveys', 'Viewing', 'again', 'recently', 'got', 'it.Set', 'early', '60s', 'story', 'R.P', 'McMurphy', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'arrival', 'mental', 'institution', 'Salem', 'Oregon', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'mental', 'illness', 'card', 'get', 'prison', 'time', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'be', 'piece', 'cake', 'wrong', 'very', 'wrong', 'Everything', 'well', 'hospital', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'be', 'benevolent', 'overseer', 'McMurphy', 'ward', 'are', 'sinister', 'things', 'going', 'surface.The', 'movie', 'way', 'institutions', 'deal', 'mental', 'illnesses', 'therapy', 'futile', 'only', 'patients', 'dependent', 'institution', 'thereby', 'creating', 'need', 'existence', 'taxpayer', 'expense', 'McMurphy', 'threat', 'establishment', 'therefore', 'must', 'be', 'dealt', 'lot', 'people', 'criticize', 'film', 'suggesting', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', 'only', 'trying', 'do', 'job', 'etc', 'had', 'same', 'reaction', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'saw', 'aspect', 'film', 'brilliance', 'Ratched', 'malevolence', 'so', 'subtle', 'filmmakers', 'allow', 'possibility', 'complete', 'misinterpretation', 'Yes', 'administrative', 'point', 'view', 'seemingly', 'good', 'job', 'authoritarian', 'being', 'sadistic', 'residents', 'as', 'long', 'follow', 'rules', 'more', 'below', 'absolutely', 'demonic', 'robotized', 'arm', 'dehumanizing', 'system', 'residents', 'state', 'oblivion', 'marginalization', 'are', 'deprived', 'dignity', 'system', 'subhuman.The', 'filmmakers', 'Fletcher', 'make', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'more', 'effective', 'antagonist', 'showing', 'restraint', 'Compare', 'say', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'portrayal', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Mommie', 'Dearest', 'pretty', 'much', 'turned', 'cartoon', 'villain', 'Ratched', ""n't"", 'such', 'obvious', 'sadist', 'rules', 'tyrannize', 'men', 'reduce', 'almost', 'infantile', 'state', 'dependency', 'subservience', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'Billy', 'Bibbit', 'Brad', 'Dourif', '.McMurphy', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'protagonist', 'story', 'impulsive', 'weakness', 'female', 'gender', 'got', 'prison', 'first', 'place', 'spirit', 'freedom', 'life', 'problem', 'learn', 'bit', 'wisdom', 'then', 'can', 'walk', 'freedom', 'causing', 'unnecessary', 'harm', 'others.Nurse', 'Ratched', 'other', 'hand', 'legal-ism', 'authoritarian', 'spirit', 'obsessed', 'laws', 'rules', 'clearly', 'seen', 'World', 'Series', 'sequence', 'Even', 'McMurphy', 'final', 'vote', 'ward', 'watch', 'Series', 'Ratched', 'allow', 'technicality', 'When', 'McMurphy', 'then', 'PRETENDS', 'watch', 'game', 'guys', 'up', 'state', 'euphoria', 'Ratched', 'sourpuss', 'disapproval', 'legalism', 'opposite', 'spirit', 'freedom', 'life', 'joy', 'Legalism', 'putting', 'appearances', 'enforcing', 'LETTER', 'law', 'rule', 'problem', 'appearances', 'are', 'not', 'reality', 'worse', 'letter', 'folly', 'mistakes', 'McMurphy', 'more', 'good', 'guys', 'ward', 'Ratched', 'institution', 'could', 'do', 'decade', 'How', 'so', 'Not', 'only', 'spirit', 'freedom', 'life', 'deeply', 'yet', 'only', 'who', 'deserve', 'humble', 'not', 'arrogant', 'abusers', 'When', 'cast', 'restraint', 'wind', 'love', 'heart', ""'ll"", 'reap', 'love', 'return', 'as', 'long', 'person', 'worthy', 'certain', 'person', 'hugs', 'McMurphy', 'end', 'film', 'McMurphy', 'set', 'free', 'shackles', 'mental', 'illness', 'worse', 'institution', 'actually', 'heal', 'mentally', 'ill', 'people', 'exist', 'only', 'motions', 'caring', 'healing', 'not', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'people', 'such', 'institutions', 'course', 'review', 'film', 'complete', 'mentioning', 'notable', 'character', 'Chief', 'played', 'effectively', 'Will', 'Sampson.The', 'film', '2', 'hours', '13', 'minutes.GRADE']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
99503,AMMEMPM9MPS55,0790732181,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[7, 10]","I read an article the other day by an evangelical theologian in which he lambasted Harry Potter, suggesting as one of his chief criticisms that Potter was a 'morally ambiguous' character and therefore unsuitable. What amazed me is that he seemed ignorant of the fact that every story thrives on those sorts of ambiguities, not least the story of the Bible which, I suggest, offers very few characters who could serve as role models without qualification. Might I mention Moses, Esther and David as just three 'morally ambigious' characters (and heroes, at that) of the Old Testament. I mention this because I can imagine (and I think I recall actually hearing) 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' being rejected by a Christian critic on precisely those grounds.Randle P. McMurphy is rebellious, licentious and from a Christian perspective, immoral. He is a violent criminal, a rapist, and yet he emerges as the hero out of this tale of a man's struggle against the establishment. McMurphy finds himself fighting against an institution which imprisons its members within a regime designed only to make them conform and serve the interests of the institution, though ostensibly for the wellbeing of the members; a regime kept alive by depriving the members of the truth about who they are; a regime in which dependency and conformity are maintained through deception and indoctrination.It was in the day when Erving Goffmann published his famous sociological study, 'Asylums,' that 'Cuckoo's Nest' had its genesis, though the film's comment goes beyond criticising merely mental institutions and their inhumane treatment of human beings. It is a vigorously anti-establishment film which rails against injustice and oppression by showing us a man's attempt to escape conformity, however ambiguous some of his actions might be when viewed in a moral light. But so compelling is the portrayal of life in a mental institution that one can scarcely ignore the warnings the film has for society. People - in fact, Christians - need to pay attention.I suspect that Christian critics who have found rape, violence and attempted murder (rightly) distasteful and rejected this film on that basis, have shot themselves in the foot. For whilst there is uproar about McMurphy's failings and the wrongness of his rebellious ways, a very revealing fact emerges. Why no uproar over the equally morally ambigious (and objectionable) character of Nurse Ratched? Why do the same critics not rally against her failings and the wrongness of her manipulative and malicious schemes which, ultimately, have far more disastrous consequences than McMurphy's actions (namely, Billy's death and McMurphy's labotomy)? The answer is that she belongs to the system, that she is middle-class, respectable, that she has authority, and therefore it scarcely occurs that we ought to be questioning her moral culpability or otherwise. Therein lies the revealing fact: that the evangelical critic has his agenda shaped far more by the system of this world - dare I say it, by the middle classes, even - than by honest, unbiased reflection.So I do not say that the moral tone of the film is pleasant. But I do suggest that in the end Nurse Ratched comes out by far the more guilty of the two main protaganists, and this ought to prompt the Christian critic to ask what the film might have to say about the way society is ordered - even if it makes him a little uncomfortable about some of his less defensible presuppositions.",4,A Christian Perspective,1006128000,"11 19, 2001",2001,3483,"['read', 'article', 'other', 'day', 'evangelical', 'theologian', 'lambasted', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'suggesting', 'one', 'chief', 'criticisms', 'Potter', 'was', ""'morally"", 'ambiguous', 'character', 'therefore', 'unsuitable', 'What', 'amazed', 'seemed', 'ignorant', 'fact', 'story', 'thrives', 'sorts', 'ambiguities', 'not', 'least', 'story', 'Bible', 'suggest', 'very', 'few', 'characters', 'who', 'could', 'serve', 'role', 'models', 'qualification', 'Might', 'mention', 'Moses', 'Esther', 'David', 'just', 'three', ""'morally"", 'ambigious', 'characters', 'heroes', 'Old', 'Testament', 'mention', 'can', 'imagine', 'think', 'recall', 'actually', 'hearing', ""'One"", 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'being', 'rejected', 'Christian', 'critic', 'precisely', 'grounds.Randle', 'P.', 'McMurphy', 'rebellious', 'licentious', 'Christian', 'perspective', 'immoral', 'violent', 'criminal', 'rapist', 'yet', 'hero', 'tale', 'man', 'struggle', 'establishment', 'McMurphy', 'fighting', 'institution', 'members', 'regime', 'designed', 'only', 'make', 'conform', 'serve', 'interests', 'institution', 'ostensibly', 'wellbeing', 'members', 'regime', 'kept', 'alive', 'depriving', 'members', 'truth', 'who', 'are', 'regime', 'dependency', 'conformity', 'are', 'maintained', 'deception', 'indoctrination.It', 'was', 'day', 'when', 'Erving', 'Goffmann', 'published', 'famous', 'sociological', 'study', 'Nest', 'had', 'genesis', 'film', 'comment', 'criticising', 'merely', 'mental', 'institutions', 'inhumane', 'treatment', 'human', 'beings', 'vigorously', 'anti-establishment', 'film', 'injustice', 'oppression', 'showing', 'man', 'attempt', 'escape', 'conformity', 'however', 'ambiguous', 'actions', 'might', 'be', 'when', 'viewed', 'moral', 'light', 'so', 'compelling', 'portrayal', 'life', 'mental', 'institution', 'one', 'can', 'scarcely', 'ignore', 'warnings', 'film', 'society', 'People', 'fact', 'Christians', 'need', 'pay', 'attention.I', 'suspect', 'Christian', 'critics', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'rape', 'violence', 'attempted', 'murder', 'rightly', 'distasteful', 'rejected', 'film', 'basis', 'have', 'shot', 'foot', 'whilst', 'uproar', 'McMurphy', 'failings', 'wrongness', 'rebellious', 'ways', 'very', 'revealing', 'fact', 'emerges', 'Why', 'uproar', 'equally', 'morally', 'ambigious', 'objectionable', 'character', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'Why', 'do', 'same', 'critics', 'not', 'rally', 'failings', 'wrongness', 'manipulative', 'malicious', 'schemes', 'ultimately', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'McMurphy', 'actions', 'namely', 'Billy', 'death', 'McMurphy', 'labotomy', 'answer', 'system', 'middle-class', 'respectable', 'authority', 'scarcely', 'ought', 'be', 'questioning', 'moral', 'culpability', 'otherwise', 'Therein', 'revealing', 'fact', 'evangelical', 'critic', 'agenda', 'shaped', 'far', 'more', 'system', 'world', 'dare', 'say', 'middle', 'classes', 'even', 'honest', 'unbiased', 'reflection.So', 'do', 'not', 'say', 'moral', 'tone', 'film', 'pleasant', 'do', 'suggest', 'end', 'Nurse', 'Ratched', 'out', 'far', 'more', 'guilty', 'two', 'main', 'protaganists', 'ought', 'prompt', 'Christian', 'critic', 'ask', 'what', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'say', 'way', 'society', 'ordered', 'even', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'less', 'defensible', 'presuppositions']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

You see, the film might not be spotless, the fashions may be out of date, and no computer-animation is in sight.  Fortunately, films like ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Next"" exist to show that some themes are relevant in ANY era.The basic plot of ""Cuckoo"" centers on R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a troublemaker who is being ""evaluated"" by a mental institution because, frankly, the law doesn't know what to do with him anymore.  During this trial period, however, McMurphy (clearly no crazier than the lot of us) begins to ""stir up"" the other ""patients"" by trying to get them to stand up against the domineering Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and showing them that a real life doesn't have to include pills, wanderings, and white uniforms (especially when he finds that most of them are ""voluntary"" anyway!).  Unfortunately, for McMurphy's sake, this ""rash"" behavior sends a ripple effect through the entire facility that ends up in disastrous effects for him.Having a wee bit of experience in the mental-evaluation field, I can say that the issues presented in this film are still being hashed out on the ""battlefields"" of such facilities to this very day.  What is ""crazy""?  How can one detect it?  Is it possible to fight against institutions of the state?  Upon finishing the viewing experience, those questions (among many others) will float around in our head long after the TV is turned off.The incredible acting in the movie also increases the enjoyment factor exponentially.  Nicholson is brilliant, as usual, while the cast of ""cooks"" (including a very young Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito) are at times a riot, but also can be quite touching.  Plus, Fletcher's Nurse Ratched (though never outwardly violent) is one of the creepiest, most hated characters in the history of cinema.Thus, if you have never seen this film, please go out and do so NOW!  It may not be overtly flashy like the big-budget epics of today, but its message and acting will immediately rank it quite high on your ""favorite films"" list.

While I had seen the introduction on television before, this was my first time watching the full movie.My family and I sat around the living room, (this includes my mom, dad, sister, and me), and we all enjoyed the movie. We absolutely loved the cast and were fascinated by some of the procedures and treatment that could take place in a 1960's mental hospital.If I had one complaint, my sister did say that it ran a little slow at some points. But this should only be a bother for younger children. It was an amazing movie and I would recommend it to anyone!Not to mention, it struck my interest in reading the novel! It is always fun to compare, especially when both pieces get such good praise!",5,I would love to read the novel now.,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,764,"['picked', 'up', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'random', 'DVD', 'hunt', 'had', 'seen', 'introduction', 'television', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'watching', 'full', 'movie.My', 'family', 'sat', 'living', 'room', 'mom', 'dad', 'sister', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'cast', 'were', 'fascinated', 'procedures', 'treatment', 'could', 'take', 'place', '1960', 'mental', 'hospital.If', 'had', 'one', 'complaint', 'sister', 'did', 'say', 'ran', 'little', 'slow', 'points', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'bother', 'younger', 'children', 'was', 'amazing', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'Not', 'mention', 'struck', 'interest', 'reading', 'novel', 'always', 'fun', 'compare', 'especially', 'when', 'pieces', 'get', 'such', 'good', 'praise']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

The film stars cinematic greats Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Louise Fletcher.Randle McMurphy is a criminal sent to a mental hospital for evaluation. His free spirit, and antics are not accepted very well by the authorities, but the patients like him a lot. He shows them how to live life, and not waste time blindly following the schedule of a dull mental hospital. But after a while Randle has enough of this prison and decides to escape but first wants to have one last good time with his new friends. And thanks to the domineering authority, this bring nothing but tragedy.The first half of this film is very funny, with lots of jokes and comedy. The second half it gets serious, and is more like a drama. The film succeeds in both of these genres. The characters seem so innocent and you care about them. You cant help but smile as Randle brings new exciting things for these people to do. The acting is great by everyone in this film. This film is considered a classic, and is highly enjoyable so I recommend this to anyone, especial if you like good comedy/dramas. 5 stars.",5,A funny/tragic comedy/drama,1036972800,"11 11, 2002",2002,1259,"['Based', 'book', 'Ken', 'Kesey', 'film', 'pulled', '5', 'Oscars', '1975', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'actor', 'best', 'actress', 'best', 'director', 'best', 'adopted', 'screenplay', 'film', 'cinematic', 'greats', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Louise', 'Fletcher.Randle', 'McMurphy', 'criminal', 'sent', 'mental', 'hospital', 'evaluation', 'free', 'spirit', 'antics', 'are', 'not', 'accepted', 'very', 'well', 'authorities', 'patients', 'lot', 'how', 'live', 'life', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'blindly', 'following', 'schedule', 'dull', 'mental', 'hospital', 'while', 'Randle', 'enough', 'prison', 'decides', 'escape', 'first', 'have', 'one', 'last', 'good', 'time', 'new', 'friends', 'thanks', 'domineering', 'authority', 'bring', 'nothing', 'tragedy.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'very', 'funny', 'lots', 'jokes', 'comedy', 'second', 'half', 'serious', 'more', 'drama', 'film', 'genres', 'characters', 'seem', 'so', 'innocent', 'care', 'cant', 'help', 'smile', 'Randle', 'new', 'exciting', 'things', 'people', 'do', 'acting', 'great', 'everyone', 'film', 'film', 'considered', 'classic', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'especial', 'like', 'good', 'comedy/dramas', '5', 'stars']",One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
