826267,A33L7G4E8CID3,B000286RO8,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[41, 41]","There is a scene in the film Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore which sums up the entire film. It is the scene in which Alice (Ellen Burstyn), newly-widowed and desperate to get a job, convinces a bar owner to see her perform across the street (the owner doesn't even have a piano in his bar). Reluctantly, he comes, and Alice sings the old Sinatra ballad, ""When Your Lover Has Gone."" It is a testament to Burstyn's acting that this scene is so hauntingly beautiful, and one senses a personal connection that she has with this song, it almost sounds as if it were written just for her. And the emotions that come through in this scene--pain, loss, but also a great deal of hope--are essentially the film in spades.It is almost passe to mourn the passing of the cinema of the 1970s, but this is exactly the sort of movie that was made then but isn't now. It is a penetrating, intensely personal but unceasingly honest portrait of a single mother's struggle to survive. Even though several decades have passed, the story remains timely because it is ultimately the story of humanity, and will have resonance for anyone who has had to leave the familiar and try to make it on their own. Some might dismiss it as an extended metaphor for feminism (which it is) but it is also much more than that--it cuts far deeper, but it is ultimately a very humanistic film.I can't stop singing this movie's praises. It inspires without being ""inspirational"". It is not an exultation of the human spirit, but rather the embodiment of it. It never sounds a hollow, false, or obvious note, but rather sticks with utter realism throughout, and as a result is immensely satisfying. I would highly recommend the movie to anyone who appreciates a good drama that doesn't unfold along the expected path.",5,Exceptional Film,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,1776,"['scene', 'film', 'Alice', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'up', 'entire', 'film', 'scene', 'Alice', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'newly-widowed', 'desperate', 'get', 'job', 'bar', 'owner', 'see', 'perform', 'street', 'owner', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'piano', 'bar', 'Reluctantly', 'Alice', 'old', 'Sinatra', 'ballad', 'When', 'Lover', 'Has', 'Gone', 'testament', 'Burstyn', 'acting', 'scene', 'so', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'one', 'personal', 'connection', 'song', 'almost', 'were', 'written', 'just', 'emotions', 'come', 'scene', 'pain', 'loss', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'hope', 'are', 'essentially', 'film', 'spades.It', 'almost', 'passe', 'mourn', 'passing', 'cinema', '1970s', 'exactly', 'sort', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'then', ""n't"", 'now', 'penetrating', 'intensely', 'personal', 'unceasingly', 'honest', 'portrait', 'single', 'mother', 'struggle', 'survive', 'Even', 'several', 'decades', 'have', 'passed', 'story', 'timely', 'ultimately', 'story', 'humanity', 'will', 'have', 'resonance', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'leave', 'familiar', 'try', 'make', 'own', 'might', 'dismiss', 'extended', 'metaphor', 'feminism', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'far', 'deeper', 'ultimately', 'very', 'humanistic', 'film.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'singing', 'movie', 'praises', 'being', 'inspirational', 'not', 'exultation', 'human', 'spirit', 'rather', 'embodiment', 'never', 'hollow', 'false', 'obvious', 'note', 'rather', 'sticks', 'utter', 'realism', 'result', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'drama', ""n't"", 'unfold', 'expected', 'path']",N/A

Traveling out to California, she ends up in Arizona, where she meets a charming man who turned out to be a married abuser.

But, David is not a man to take no for an answer, and he is a man who cares for Alice.This is a surprisingly powerful movie. Ellen Burstyn perfectly pulls of the role of Alice, portraying well her vulnerability and her determination. Kris Kristofferson...well, is Kris Kristofferson! As always he presents a manly man who is still sensitive, strong and yet totally huggable.

826270,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000286RO8,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","When discussing the great Martin Scorsese with friends I am quick to label him a one trick pony, and they are quick to call me out on the fact that I have not seen enough of his films to accurately judge him.  Sure, I've seen his lauded gangster films, and I personally prefer the few films I've seen of his that are not mob-related, but there is always yet another film I had no idea was a Scorsese picture that I need to see.`Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore' was one of them.Knowing and loving some of the cast (Ellen Burstyn and Harvey Kietel to be exact) I was quick to snatch this one up in anticipation of something great.  Instead I got a mixed bag of `good, a little better, not so wonderful and mediocre'.  Nothing can be taken away from some of the performances, especially that of Burstyn and her on-screen romantic lead Kris Kristofferson, but one can fault Scorsese for not fully understanding how to develop this film properly.It feels a lot of the time that he didn't really know what type of film he was attempting to make.The film tells the story of unhappy housewife Alice who is forced to make it on her own after her husband dies in a car accident.  Taking to the road with her bratty son and high hopes of making it as a singer, Alice finds herself working in a diner in order to make ends meat and falling in love with a divorced farmer.  She meets some other interesting people along the way (most notable is an abusive married lover and a foul mouthed co-worker) who also make an impact on the person she is to become.Burstyn is wonderful as Alice.  She has her moments of `all over the place' but she manages to rein them in nicely to create a solidly entertaining and relatable character.  I don't know if I would have necessarily handed her an Oscar for this, but I can see why the Academy wanted to award her.  Kristofferson is just as good, matching her zaniness with warmth and compassion.  Diane Ladd is hilarious and engaging and Harvey Keitel is charming and dangerous.  I was not a fan of the kid, Alfred Lutter, but I adored young Jodie Foster (who quite looked like a little boy here).The acting is not the problem, and really neither is the script.  It's the way Scorsese decided to shoot the film.  It's played up like a comedy, then like a drama but it never meshes well enough as a dramedy.  It seems like it was shot as two separate films with two separate tones and then edited into one complete movie.  Sadly, it doesn't feel complete.I'd say that Scorsese doesn't know how to craft a comedy, but that would be a lie since his 1983 film `The King of Comedy' is a comedic (or should I say dramedic) goldmine.I'm not saying stay away from this one, because it has its highlights, and the acting is really quite good.  It also spawned some popular sitcoms, and if you were familiar with those then you may want to see how they got their start.  I am saying not to get your hopes up for something brilliant.  This is a decent film that falls short of what it could have been.",3,It seems a little off kilter...,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,3014,"['When', 'discussing', 'great', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'friends', 'am', 'quick', 'label', 'one', 'trick', 'pony', 'are', 'quick', 'call', 'out', 'fact', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'enough', 'films', 'accurately', 'judge', 'Sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lauded', 'gangster', 'films', 'personally', 'prefer', 'few', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'not', 'mob-related', 'always', 'yet', 'film', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'Scorsese', 'picture', 'need', 'see.', 'Alice', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'was', 'one', 'them.Knowing', 'loving', 'cast', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Harvey', 'Kietel', 'be', 'exact', 'was', 'quick', 'snatch', 'one', 'up', 'anticipation', 'something', 'great', 'Instead', 'got', 'mixed', 'bag', 'good', 'little', 'better', 'not', 'so', 'wonderful', 'mediocre', 'Nothing', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'performances', 'especially', 'Burstyn', 'on-screen', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'one', 'can', 'fault', 'Scorsese', 'not', 'fully', 'understanding', 'how', 'develop', 'film', 'properly.It', 'lot', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'type', 'film', 'was', 'attempting', 'make.The', 'film', 'story', 'unhappy', 'housewife', 'Alice', 'who', 'forced', 'make', 'own', 'husband', 'car', 'accident', 'Taking', 'road', 'bratty', 'son', 'high', 'hopes', 'making', 'singer', 'Alice', 'working', 'diner', 'order', 'make', 'ends', 'meat', 'falling', 'love', 'divorced', 'farmer', 'other', 'interesting', 'people', 'way', 'most', 'notable', 'abusive', 'married', 'lover', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'co-worker', 'who', 'also', 'make', 'impact', 'person', 'become.Burstyn', 'wonderful', 'Alice', 'moments', 'place', 'rein', 'nicely', 'create', 'solidly', 'entertaining', 'relatable', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'have', 'necessarily', 'handed', 'Oscar', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Academy', 'wanted', 'award', 'Kristofferson', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'matching', 'zaniness', 'warmth', 'compassion', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'hilarious', 'engaging', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'charming', 'dangerous', 'was', 'not', 'fan', 'kid', 'Alfred', 'Lutter', 'adored', 'young', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'quite', 'looked', 'little', 'boy', 'here', '.The', 'acting', 'not', 'problem', 'really', 'script', 'way', 'Scorsese', 'decided', 'shoot', 'film', 'played', 'up', 'comedy', 'then', 'drama', 'never', 'well', 'enough', 'dramedy', 'was', 'shot', 'two', 'separate', 'films', 'two', 'separate', 'tones', 'then', 'edited', 'one', 'complete', 'movie', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'feel', 'complete.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'Scorsese', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'craft', 'comedy', 'would', 'be', 'lie', '1983', 'film', 'King', 'Comedy', 'comedic', 'should', 'say', 'dramedic', 'goldmine.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'stay', 'away', 'one', 'highlights', 'acting', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'also', 'spawned', 'popular', 'sitcoms', 'were', 'familiar', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'got', 'start', 'am', 'saying', 'not', 'get', 'hopes', 'up', 'something', 'brilliant', 'decent', 'film', 'short', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

826272,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000286RO8,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 1]","This is one of those movies that did not age well. Or maybe I only liked it when it was new because I had the hots for Kris Kristofferson.Ellen Burstyn is Alice Hyatt, married to an SOB truck driver in New Mexico who smacks her and sometimes her kid, but is not violent enough for her to leave him. They fight a lot, even in front of the kid. Then her husband is killed when his truck is smashed up. She decides that she and her son Tommy (Alfred Lutter) are going to go back to Monterey where she lived as a kid. I don't think she ever mentions going to Tommy's grandparents or anything, and all they have for money is what she earned at a garage sale before she left.Now, there are a great many stupid things about this movie, but one of the most stupid is that they first head for Phoenix. It's way at the south end of Arizona, and Monterey is in the middle of California, quite a bit north. So the sensible thing would be for them go along the more northerly route through Flagstaff.Oh, I'm not going to detail the whole thing. She gets a job as a singer in a cocktail lounge, gets seduced by a really bad guy named Ben (Harvey Keitel), and ends up fleeing for her and her son's lives. They get no further than Tucson, where the only job she can get is a waitress. That's where David (Kris Kristofferson) finds her, and he's just so nice compared to the other men she's had that . . . well, Tommy likes him, too.There's really not much story, when you come right down to it. I'd call it a Romantic Comedy, but there's not all that much humor. There's a waitress she works with who has a really dirty mouth, but it's seldom all that funny. In fact, one of the most interesting parts is Audrey (Jodie Foster) acting so terribly grown up in order to lead Tommy astray. Remember that Foster and Keitel worked together again in ""Taxi Driver.""",2,I Like It Better When Both of Us Were Much Younger,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,1841,"['one', 'movies', 'did', 'not', 'age', 'well', 'maybe', 'only', 'liked', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'had', 'hots', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson.Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Alice', 'Hyatt', 'married', 'SOB', 'truck', 'driver', 'New', 'Mexico', 'who', 'sometimes', 'kid', 'not', 'violent', 'enough', 'leave', 'fight', 'lot', 'even', 'front', 'kid', 'Then', 'husband', 'killed', 'when', 'truck', 'smashed', 'up', 'son', 'Tommy', 'Alfred', 'Lutter', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'back', 'Monterey', 'where', 'lived', 'kid', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'mentions', 'going', 'Tommy', 'grandparents', 'anything', 'have', 'money', 'what', 'earned', 'garage', 'sale', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'stupid', 'things', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'stupid', 'first', 'head', 'Phoenix', 'way', 'south', 'end', 'Arizona', 'Monterey', 'middle', 'California', 'quite', 'bit', 'north', 'sensible', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'go', 'more', 'northerly', 'route', 'Flagstaff.Oh', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'detail', 'whole', 'thing', 'job', 'singer', 'cocktail', 'lounge', 'seduced', 'really', 'bad', 'guy', 'named', 'Ben', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'up', 'fleeing', 'son', 'lives', 'get', 'further', 'Tucson', 'where', 'only', 'job', 'can', 'get', 'waitress', 'where', 'David', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'just', 'so', 'nice', 'compared', 'other', 'men', 'had', 'well', 'Tommy', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'when', 'come', 'right', 'down', ""'d"", 'call', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'humor', 'waitress', 'who', 'really', 'dirty', 'mouth', 'seldom', 'funny', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'Audrey', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'acting', 'so', 'terribly', 'grown', 'up', 'order', 'lead', 'Tommy', 'astray', 'Remember', 'Foster', 'Keitel', 'worked', 'together', 'again', 'Taxi', 'Driver']",N/A

826279,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B000286RO8,Green Manalishi,"[2, 2]","A decent little flick in the style of 'New Hollywood' of the early 70s, similar in tone to movies of that period like The Last Detail, Scarecrow, Five Easy Pieces etc. though unlike those films it centers around a woman.  There's a 'slice of life' art to these movies that I admire, like poetry, though, like poetry, you don't come to it for the entertainment value of say a best-selling novel or the latest HBO special.  The film held my interest as well as any movie from this period could be expected to, but what keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it didn't move me terribly one way or the other by the end.Barkin's character Alice often seems like a breakdown isn't too far away, though it's not surprising given the circumstances.  I did enjoy her brief singing career and wonder if she really did sing.. Would have liked to have had more of that and maybe less romance with Kristofferson.  But it wasn't to be.. Alice's life was wrapped up in A) survival - in terms of money, finding a job and place to live, and B) in terms of surviving the men in her life. Her son I actually quite liked and wouldn't have described as bratty at all (although the jokes were a bit much).  He dealt with things remarkably well considering the conditions of their lives at that point.Other reasons to see this film:  you get to see Jodie Foster as a boy, Keitel and Kristofferson in typical roles, and check off your list one more movie by Scorcese that you haven't seen.  I liked Alice better than Mean Streets which preceded, but not as much as After Hours which is a very entertaining film (if you like black humor).Finally, I didn't know the 70s sit-com Alice had derived from this movie, though so it did, and the same Mel from Mel's Diner is actually in this movie.  And I know it's a bit off the point, but I wish they'd put out season sets of the sit-com Alice.

826282,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B000286RO8,JGC,"[12, 19]","""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" came out in late 1974 and was billed as an anthem for women.Ellen Burstyn plays Alice Hyatt, a recently widowed 30-something mother. The movie starts out by showing her husband (before he died.) Donald (Billy Green Busch) was an abusive man that didn't pay his wife or son much attention. But Alice thinks that there isn't any cold side of the bed as long as a man is in it; so she stands by her husband.After her husband's untimely death I thought that maybe Alice will start to live life and wouldn't be so hopeless anymore. I was very wrong. Her life went from miserable to even more miserable. Alice just seemed so incredibly harried throughout the entire movie. She packs up her meager belongings and embarks on a new life with her foul-mouthed son, Tommy (Alfred Lutter III.) Alice's only trade is her musical voice.Alice stumbles into a dark little bar and asks the owner to give her an audition. When he tells her that his isn't a singing bar Alice turns on the water works. This was so annoying because if anyone else did this they would have been shown the door, but since she was a blonde in snug dress the owner actually gave her an audition and then a job! I wasn't fond of Alice's singing (it was very moody without much of a beat.) And I couldn't help but think that Alice was the type of woman who would flash a little leg to get things going her way, and then scream harassment if she didn't get what she wanted. If that's women's lib then I'm Abraham Lincoln.Soon, Alice finds a little fly buzzing around her, Ben (a very young-looking Harvey Keitel.) At first he seemed somewhat charming and sweet, but he turned out to be an abusive (married) alcoholic, not unlike Alice's late-husband. This time Alice can't swat away her little pest so she does the only thing she can do; she flees for Tucson.Alice lands a job as a waitress at Mel & Ruby's Cafe. She really doesn't care for the job, but it's a start and a way to help support her son. She also doesn't care much for her colleague, Flo (Diane Ladd) who was just as vulgar as any 18-wheel trucker. But I suspect that Alice may have felt threatned by this other blonde who drew men to her. However Alice does befriend Flo, eventually. Soon Alice meets diner-patron David (Kris Kristofferson), and even sooner she hops right into his sack.Jodi Foster has a small part as a tom-boy (Audrey/Doris) that befriends Tommy. Audrey is even more wild and out of control than Tommy.I really did not care for this movie very much. It didn't seem to have much of a point and the ending was incredibly anti-climactic. There were a few funny lines (with Flo and Mel, played by the legendary, late Vic Tayback.) But overall, I was not too impressed with this movie because it was rather boring and difficult to watch.I was a HUGE fan of the sitcomAlicewith Linda Lavin and I expected this movie to be a feel-good movie similar to the TV program. No matter what Alice (on the TV show) always managed to turn a bad situation into something positive and she was always such a kind-hearted person that really cared for people. I remember in one of the earliest eps of ""Alice"" she said: Any day can be a good day if you work hard at it, and I think that statement really embodies what the TV show was all about; turning something not so good into something that is.The ""Alice"" in this movie was someone I did not know. There was no similarities between this Alice and the Alice on TV. The only part that (slightly) reminded me of the Alice I grew up with was when she gave away the shawl to the elderly lady at her yard sale. But other than that I got the impression that Movie-Alice was a wanton woman that didn't have much to say or do; TV-Alice always had a message and was always so positive. And I can't believe that the TV show Alice was adapted from this movie because the movie seemed somewhat risque (not for 2007, but for 1974 it sure was.)

826284,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B000286RO8,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[0, 0]","Ever since I got a DVD player, a number of years ago, the one movie title, I have been looking in vain for, is the wonderful, 1974 comedy/drama, ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"". Now, with the recent treasure trove of DVD releases of Director, Martin Scorsese's Warner Brothers film output, the wait is finally over. The film takes place in the American South-West. Alice Hyatt (a brilliant Ellen Burstyn) is an unhappy housewife, trapped in a stale marriage with an angry man (Billy Green Bush), who seems to have little interest in her. She spends her days cooking, cleaning and trying to keep her husband from ""killing"" Tommy (Alfred Lutter III), their bratty, twelve year old child. Fate intervenes, when her husband suddenly dies in a truck accident. With little money in her pocket, the newly widowed, Alice and her son set out in a battered station wagon to Monterey, CA with hopes of renewing her past career as a lounge singer. During the course of the trip, we follow  this mom across the West as she sings in bars, becomes a waitress in a lousy Tuscon, AZ diner and eventually finds true love with a 'too good to be true' local rancher named David (Kris Kristofferson). The movie isn't just about the physical journey that Alice takes. Instead the film looks at Alice's emotional journey of self discovery as a women & human being. She learns, that she is more than just a housewife, who needs to be taken care of. She has hopes & dreams and can stand on her own two feet to try to achieve them. Now, normally, when one thinks of films about ""women's issues"", Martin Scorsese's name does not pop up. This is the director, who became famous for films about 'wiseguys', prize fighters and psychotic taxi cab drivers. But ""Alice"" proved that Scorsese is one of America's  premiere film makers, who can master any genre. Just watch the scene, where the recently widowed, Alice sits at her home piano and plays Rogers & Hart's ""Where or When"". Scorsese's camera slowly circles around her and we just get mesmerized by how lost she is in the music. The scene is so simple, yet so brilliant. The acting in the film is as good as you can get. Ellen Burstyn roundly deserves her 1974 Academy Award for 'Best Actress'. She just runs through so many emotions and gives such a heart felt performance. Alfred Lutter III also gives a very funny and genuine performance as Tommy. You could practically look up the words ""bratty attention-starved kid"" in the dictionary and find his picture. The smaller roles are done well also. There are great performances from Diane Ladd as the saucey waitress, Flo and a really scarey bit of acting from Harvey Keitel as an abusive man, Alice has a short relationship with. Finally mention should be made of the movie's wonderful soundtrack. It is made up of an eclectic mixture of classic popular standards, rock n' roll and country, that not only lends atmosphere and ambience, but also comments on the scenes they are in. A good example is the film's opening scenes, where we are treated to the highly stylized, rose colored memories of Alice's childhood. Over the soundtrack we hear Alice Faye gently singing ""You'll Never Know"". Abruptly, the scene ends and we are jolted back to gritty, reality with the hard rock of Mott the Hoople's ""All the way to Memphis."" This is Scorese's genuise at work!

826285,APN6DO7VHDLTN,B000286RO8,Missing Person,"[25, 25]","""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" tells the story of a woman who attempts to forge her own path following her husband's sudden death.  The general concept of a woman having her own career and not just being a housewife certainly isn't as radical today as it was when this first came out in 1974, but ""Alice..."" nevertheless remains a powerful drama thanks to thoroughly terrific performances, and to that trademark Scorsese grittiness.You can tell that while filming this movie, Ellen Burstyn really WAS Alice Hyatt--her performance is brilliant and flawlessly convincing.  Alice's husband Donald (Billy ""Green"" Bush) dies early in the film in a traffic accident, and it becomes apparent that Alice relied on his financial support while not really being in love him.  As we see in the dreamlike opening scene, Alice had aspired to be a singer as a child, a dream that she let fall by the wayside in favor of a typical role as a housewife.  With her husband out of the picture, Alice has an 'everything-must-go' type garage sale, sells the house, and hits the road, leaving Socorro, New Mexico with her often annoying, yet sharp 11-year-old son Tommy (Alfred Lutter).When in Phoenix, a sympathetic bar owner is impressed enough by Alice's audition to hire her to play piano and sing, leading to her meeting of Ben Eberhardt, a character brilliantly portrayed by Harvey Keitel.  Ben displays a certain laidback charm, and Alice, who deep down does want to have a man around, falls for him, only to discover that he's already married and prone to fits of violence.  Keitel is absolutely devastating in the unforgettable ""break in"" scene that occurs at the motel Alice and Tommy are staying at, a scene which prompts Alice to get out of town immediately.Their next stop is Tucson, where Alice despairingly settles for a waitressing job.  At the restaurant begins her initially rocky relationship with fellow waitress Flo (Diane Ladd).  She also meets at the restaurant the charming, divorced farmer David, played by Kris Kristofferson in a natural, engaging performance.  Despite her wariness, Alice does fall in love with David, but the relationship isn't exactly smooth sailing, and it leads Alice into a painful realization about her own son.  Meanwhile, Tommy is hanging out with his new friend, the mischievous Audrey, played astonishingly by an 11 or 12 year old Jodie Foster.Ultimately, we do get a full-blown happy-ending, and that's okay, because it's touchingly done, and the path that leads to that ending is such a rewarding one.  ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" is a film no serious viewer should miss.As usual for a Martin Scorsese direction, this DVD release of ""Alice..."" is very, very well done, featuring an absolutely superb widescreen transfer of the film.

It was no surprise that she won an Academy Award for her work. The film is about a newly single mother and her 11 year old son (turns 12 during the course of the film). In the beginning they just can't seem to settle down in one place, they move a number of times. They even shared a motel room for a while. Burstyn's character is an aspiring singer who plays piano as well. Even though she's pretty good, she still has alot of trouble finding work as a singer. In order to get by she takes a job as a waitress, where in turn she meets a man that changes everything. Even though they have their relationship issues, he is who we hope she'll end up with. I won't say anymore about what takes place, because I may give away too much to those who haven't seen the film yet.

826288,A1UGBHFRUDNYD1,B000286RO8,"Nenah Sylver ""Nenah Sylver, PhD, author""","[5, 10]","Despite the glowing reviews of many critics, I did not feel drawn to the characters. Ellen Burstyn (who sings passably and appears to play piano well, I might add) was never quite believable as Alice, a woman who begins to experience her true potential after her abusive husband dies and she's left to support herself and her obnoxious son by pursuing a longstanding dream of being a professional singer. The most real and believable -- and also enjoyable -- character in the entire movie is the waitress Flo, played to perfection by Diane Ladd.The film moves slowly, a pace that is agonizing when her young hyperactive son screeches, whines, and nags at high decibel levels, which he does a lot in the film. One wonders why Alice puts up with this nonsense. In the special feature interview (which is more enjoyable than the film itself), Burstyn shares that just before filming she was in the midst of a divorce and was finding herself, so she related strongly to the character of Alice. Unfortunately, Burstyn's inner turmoil was not adequately translated into the character of Alice. Burstyn simply seems to be too strong a person to put up with abuse; therefore, her presumed vulnerability in the character of Alice does not always work.In the special feature, Kris Kristofferson describes how he nervously became a cast member of this film without knowing how to act. It's apparent that to a large degree in the film, he's not acting, but is being himself. A notable exception is when, in a formidable and memorable display of passionate anger, he spanks and yells at the misbehaving son. (We learn in the special features interview that the boy was not acting, he was just being himself. Unless you like snotty, bratty, noisy kids, you might want to fast forward through these tortuous scenes.)One high point of the film is the underappreciated Valerie Curtin, who plays a fumbling, amusing waitress in a clever and hilarious diner scene that's probably the best scene in the entire movie. (Curtin also played Meg Foster's rejected lover in A Different Story.) Another high point is an appearance by the adolescent Jodie Foster, an incredible androgynous powerhouse of energy and poise. It was also interesting to see a very young Harvey Keitel, whose charm and scary abuse were quite believable.If you don't mind a slow pace or whiny kids, and don't expect too much, you may enjoy this film.",2,"Very uneven acting, slow plot, but has its enjoyable moments",1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,2399,"['glowing', 'reviews', 'many', 'critics', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'drawn', 'characters', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'who', 'passably', 'play', 'piano', 'well', 'might', 'add', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'believable', 'Alice', 'woman', 'who', 'experience', 'true', 'potential', 'abusive', 'husband', 'dies', 'left', 'support', 'obnoxious', 'son', 'pursuing', 'longstanding', 'dream', 'being', 'professional', 'singer', 'most', 'real', 'believable', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'entire', 'movie', 'waitress', 'Flo', 'played', 'perfection', 'Diane', 'Ladd.The', 'film', 'moves', 'slowly', 'pace', 'agonizing', 'when', 'young', 'hyperactive', 'son', 'screeches', 'whines', 'nags', 'high', 'decibel', 'levels', 'lot', 'film', 'One', 'why', 'Alice', 'up', 'nonsense', 'special', 'feature', 'interview', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Burstyn', 'shares', 'just', 'filming', 'was', 'midst', 'divorce', 'was', 'finding', 'related', 'strongly', 'character', 'Alice', 'Unfortunately', 'Burstyn', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'was', 'not', 'adequately', 'translated', 'character', 'Alice', 'Burstyn', 'simply', 'be', 'too', 'strong', 'person', 'put', 'up', 'abuse', 'therefore', 'presumed', 'vulnerability', 'character', 'Alice', 'not', 'always', 'work.In', 'special', 'feature', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'how', 'nervously', 'became', 'cast', 'member', 'film', 'knowing', 'how', 'act', 'apparent', 'large', 'degree', 'film', 'not', 'acting', 'being', 'notable', 'exception', 'when', 'formidable', 'memorable', 'display', 'passionate', 'anger', 'yells', 'misbehaving', 'son', 'learn', 'special', 'features', 'interview', 'boy', 'was', 'not', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'snotty', 'bratty', 'noisy', 'kids', 'might', 'want', 'fast', 'forward', 'tortuous', 'scenes', 'One', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'underappreciated', 'Valerie', 'Curtin', 'who', 'fumbling', 'amusing', 'waitress', 'clever', 'hilarious', 'diner', 'scene', 'probably', 'best', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'Curtin', 'also', 'played', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'rejected', 'lover', 'A', 'Different', 'Story', 'high', 'point', 'appearance', 'adolescent', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'incredible', 'androgynous', 'powerhouse', 'energy', 'poise', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'very', 'young', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'charm', 'scary', 'abuse', 'were', 'quite', 'believable.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'slow', 'pace', 'whiny', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'may', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A

Departing from his formulaic atmosphere of dark brooding unscrupulous characters, ""Alice..."" tells the story of Alice Hyatt (Ellen Burstyn) an abused housewife on the verge of a nervous breakdown when her husband, Donald (Billy Green Bush) is suddenly killed in a truck accident.  Determined to exploit the tragedy as her new lease on life, Alice packs up her station wagon with son, Tommy (Alfred Lutter) in tow.  Alice's dreams of becoming a singer are short lived but a second chance at romance might be in the stars when Alice lands a job as a waitress at Mel & Ruby's Caf&eacute; where a frequent customer, David (Kris Kristofferson) recognizes Alice's innate value as a soul mate. Burstyn's tour de force performance won her the 1974 Academy Award as Best Actress and the film spawned the long running, highly successful television series, ""Alice.""Warner's DVD certainly delivers with vibrant colors. Black levels are very deep and whites are always clean. Contrast and fine details are nicely realized with only a hint of film grain. During the opening shots there is some very distracting artifacting going on but this vanishes after the opening credits for a picture that will surely NOT disappoint.

So she stops somewhere before her destination to be a singer at a bar to earn more money, but obviously it didn't work out for her the way she wanted it. So Alice continues to go on and makes a stop at Tucson, Arizona where she becomes a waitress at Mel's Diner. She finds her new love interest with Kris Kristofferson's character who happens to be a divorced, abusive father. He finds a way to win Alice back.

Alice's dream of becoming a singer didn't come true.Jodie Foster in this movie was her first which helped spun her career into stardom.

She was a very clever kid by knowin how to get her own way without getting caught.Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore was a great film that spun a TV series ""Alice"" for nine seasons. These characters in this show played by different actors except for the character of Mel which played by the late-great actor Vic Tayback who was also in the film. The waitresses in the show was played by Linda Lavin (Alice) Polly Holliday (Flo) Beth Howland (Vera) Philip McKeon (Tommy).The movie Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore should be watched to see how this movie became such an award-winning hit!

This whimsical, nostalgic scene is abruptly ended when Alice exclaims, ""If they don't like it they can blow it out their ass!"" Suddenly the muted, highly stylized images of Oz become starkly realistic and we are no longer in dreamland! It's the early 70's and Alice, 27 years removed from her Dorothy period, is middle aged with a smartass difficult boy, and a not so smart husband she can't seem to please and who makes no attempt whatsoever to please her. Her dream is now somewhere over the rainbow until fate steps in, removing her husband and freeing Alice from drudgery. Now what? Broke, no job, no one to lean on and yet having a child that needs support, Alice sets out on the road with her dream as the ultimate destination.  Soon Alice will discover that real life has a way of lowering expectations, and Martin Scorsese's film is a slice of real life. The struggle and uncertainty, especially for a woman in a man's world, can be daunting, but Alice is nothing if not determined. This film works due to the genuineness of the characters, the outstanding performance of Ellen Burstyn, and because it glorifies something everyone can strive for: small victories.

Southwestern scenery, interesting soundtrack and authentic details all enrich the story.  Ellen Burstyn is excellent in the title role and Kris Kristofferson is adequate as her rancher love interest.  Alfred Lutter has lots of screen time and is so convincing as Alice's annoying almost 12 year old son, Tommy, I feel like I went to school with him.  Yet the host of smaller and more memorable characters really make the movie shine.  Jodie Foster is great as a worldly preteen who lures Tommy in to a brush with the law.  Harvey Keitel is fascinating playing a character who appears at first to be an awkward, nice guy enamored of a lounge singing Alice but morphs into an abusive and threatening lover who also turns out to be a married man.  Diane Lane's Flo is so much more real and nuanced than the ""kiss my grits"" Flo we saw on the 1970's situation comedy ""Alice"" that was inspired by the movie.  That characters of Mel, Vera, Bea and a host of other smaller parts are given believable portrayals.  The end of the movie is delivered with a subtle touch.

She found the script for ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" and fell in love with the lead character. In the early '70's it was very hard for actresses to find roles that carried an entire movie, but with ""Alice"" things finally saw a turnaround for women in cinema. ""Alice"" was one of the first films to dramatize a woman making it out on her on in the world without the help of a man.Burstyn stars as Alice Hyatt whose loveless husband dies and her leaves her broke. She decides to leave town and take her mouthy son with her to California, in the town she was brought up. On her way she stops in Tuscon, Arizona, where she gets a job as a waitess at Mel's Diner to make extra money. Alice's real career is as a singer, but she has a hard time making it.The film is filled with many talented actors, including Harvey Keitell, who plays one of Alice's new boyfriends, who turns out to be psychotic. This was also Jodie Foster's first film role. Kris Kristofferson stars as the man who falls in love with Alice, despite the problems he encounters with her son.Martin Scorsese directed the film, and Burstyn would win the Academy Award in 1974 as Best Actress. She has written a splendid autobiography entitled ""Lessons In Becoming Myself"" which contains some neat info on the making of ""Alice"".The film would span the televison sitcom of the same name in 1976 starring Linda Lavin in the title role. Ellen Burstyn stated that although she acted as a silent producer on the movie, she did not receive one penny from the TV show. Vic Tayback who plays Mel in the film, reprises his role for the series, and Alfred Lutter, who played Tommy in the movie, only did the pilot, as producers replaced him with another actor. Diane Ladd, who plays Flo in the film, would join the sitcom in later seasons playing another part.The DVD is beautiful, with the movie being cleaned and comes in widescreen format.

826301,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B000286RO8,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[7, 7]","The opening of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore must have been daring for 1974: it's a Wizard of Oz parody, a depiction of Dorothy's fairytale world of Kansas, but definitely without the sweet dialogue we're accustomed to hearing from that film.  In two short minutes, we're told that modern times (""modern times"" being the early-mid 1970s) are quite different from the world into which Alice Hyatt was born.  You've come a long way, baby.I was struck by how dated this film is in some ways.  But of course what else could be expected.  This was the beginning of the women's movement, and in the film Alice, played brilliantly by Ellen Burstyn, finds herself widowed, alone with a 12-year-old kid, and without any visible means of support.  And women didn't necessarily have all the options then that they have now.This could have been played as a maudlin or preachy piece, but what makes Alice such a joy is that the film never loses its sense of humor, because Hyatt never loses her sense of humor about life as she goes about talking to her child in funny voices and listening to his interminable unfunny jokes. (At least, they're not funny if you're older than 12.)  At the same time, we always manage to appreciate her situation--the film also doesn't go for easy laughs.  The sequence where she decides she has to get a job as a singer, and goes from dive to dive until one kind-hearted owner takes pity on her, is heart-breakingly real.  Again, Scorsese could have gone the easy route and played the guy as a letch who would only agree to give her the jog if she slept with him, but he avoids the obvious, thank heavens, and instead we get a study of human nature instead of a feminist cliche.I did have some problems with this film, mostly of the narrative kind.  The fights with Kris Kristofferson's character seem a bit contrived.  In the end we don't really sense if Alice will be any happier.  Maybe Kristofferson will be a jerk towards her.  She's still no to her dream as a singer, and a dream is what it is as best, because it's obvious she doesn't have the talent to make it big, or even make it period.  (Even a mediocre version of ""Where or When"" can be moving, however.)But although the finish isn't perfect, the journey sure is interesting.  Alice is a survivor.  She's not booksmart, but she's streetsmart.  She's not sexy, but she is attractive.  She's not vulnerable, but she's not a cold and aloof character either.What makes most of the film work is the miraculous performance by Ellen Burstyn.  She got an Oscar for this, and she deserved it.  Also outstanding is Alfred Lutter as 12-year-old Donald Hyatt.  He had almost no prior screen experience, but you'd never know it.  Billy Green Bush is completely convincing as the domineering husband who gets KOed in a truck accident.  Kristofferson is standard-issue Kristofferson--good enough, but not particularly memorable.  Scorsese sprinkles his special restless energy over the whole trhing to make it play just right.  Few movies have such honest, unsentimentalized visions of everyday folks in everyday places.  My only problem is with some of the diner scenes, which were played a little too over-the-top.  If Scorsese was trying for comedy it wasn't funny.  If he was trying for heightened drama it wasn't convincing.  Those scenes seemed to go against the grain of the rest of the movie's naturalistic style.  Also, those who grew up on the TV sitcom Alice may be surprised how little the diner--and the characters of Mel, Flo and Vera--figure in the film.As usual, Warner Bros. does an excellent job with the DVD.  (They're Criterion's only serious competition when it comes to reissues.)  The print looks so good you'd think this was shot yesterday--I barely noticed a spec of dirt on this 32-year-old film.  The disc features the theatrical trailer and an interesting retrospective with Kristofferson and Burstyn, but no one else.  Their reminiscences are interesting and fun, however.  I'm really not sure, 30 years later, if this is a ""great"" film.

The camera is still restless but where many of his later films have gravitated towards camera effects and viscera, the nervy photography is here still designed to serve the characters rather than just pump up the scene. There are still the inevitable explosions of violence (when you see a soft-spoken and charming Harvey Keitel, you know a flick-knife's not far behind) but in a recognisable domestic context here.Dealing with everyday people and everyday emotions, the opening sequence hints at the shortfall between movie-inspired dreams and real life that was to become the backbone of Scorsese's heavily stylised New York, New York, but while the less ambitious film, this is by far the more perfectly realised. And Ellen Burstyn's performance is a revelation. As the recently widowed mother trying to eke out a living as a singer on the road but ending up as a waitress in a small-town cafe, she demonstrates an astonishing range without resorting to the kind of acting pyrotechnics and incessant technique that limited so many actresses of the Streep era. Even in an oustanding cast, she leaves them all standing.With a great use of music - as in Mean Streets a mixed bag of seventies rock and standards - and an exciting blend of energy and sensitivity that comes as much from the superb screenplay as the direction, this too has defied the years and remains just as vital and relevant to everyday life and dreams four decades on as it did on its first release.Along with a good widescreen transfer the disc includes an audio commentary by Martin Scorsese, Ellen Burstyn and Kris Kristofferson, a documentary featurette Second Chances and the original theatrical trailer.",4,Scorsese channels Douglas Sirk,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,1910,"['times', 'almost', 'harking', 'back', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'weepies', '50s', 'Scorsese', 'follow-up', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'different', 'material', 'much', 'same', 'manner', 'noticeably', 'bigger', 'budget', 'camera', 'still', 'restless', 'where', 'many', 'later', 'films', 'have', 'gravitated', 'towards', 'camera', 'effects', 'viscera', 'nervy', 'photography', 'here', 'still', 'designed', 'serve', 'characters', 'rather', 'just', 'pump', 'up', 'scene', 'are', 'still', 'inevitable', 'explosions', 'violence', 'when', 'see', 'soft-spoken', 'charming', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'know', 'flick-knife', 'not', 'far', 'recognisable', 'domestic', 'context', 'here.Dealing', 'everyday', 'people', 'everyday', 'emotions', 'opening', 'sequence', 'hints', 'shortfall', 'movie-inspired', 'dreams', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'become', 'backbone', 'Scorsese', 'heavily', 'stylised', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'less', 'ambitious', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'perfectly', 'realised', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'performance', 'revelation', 'recently', 'widowed', 'mother', 'trying', 'eke', 'out', 'living', 'singer', 'road', 'ending', 'up', 'waitress', 'small-town', 'cafe', 'astonishing', 'range', 'resorting', 'kind', 'acting', 'pyrotechnics', 'incessant', 'technique', 'limited', 'so', 'many', 'actresses', 'Streep', 'era', 'Even', 'oustanding', 'cast', 'standing.With', 'great', 'use', 'music', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'mixed', 'bag', 'seventies', 'rock', 'standards', 'exciting', 'blend', 'energy', 'sensitivity', 'as', 'much', 'superb', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'too', 'defied', 'years', 'just', 'vital', 'relevant', 'everyday', 'life', 'dreams', 'four', 'decades', 'did', 'first', 'release.Along', 'good', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'documentary', 'featurette', 'Second', 'Chances', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

It reveals the escapism and yearning inherent to rural southwestern life. This is an excellent film from the earlier career days of distinquished directors and actors. You can certainly understand the Best Actress award that went to Ellen. A pre-teenage Jodie Foster is a bonus. Just about everyone that sees it loves this movie classic.",5,Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,493,"['are', 'more', 'laughs', 'cries', 'struggles', 'heartaches', 'lessons', 'packed', 'one-woman-on-the-road', 'show', 'just', 'other', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'escapism', 'yearning', 'inherent', 'rural', 'southwestern', 'life', 'excellent', 'film', 'earlier', 'career', 'days', 'distinquished', 'directors', 'actors', 'can', 'certainly', 'understand', 'Best', 'Actress', 'award', 'went', 'Ellen', 'pre-teenage', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'bonus', 'Just', 'everyone', 'movie', 'classic']",N/A
