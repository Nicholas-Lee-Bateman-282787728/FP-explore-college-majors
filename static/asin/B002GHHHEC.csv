That the blame was not put completely on the parents but also on other factors in the girl's life.  I was impressed by her desire to find alternatives to cutting.

1267479,A14A4YYKPLYY26,B002GHHHEC,LactivistAnti-VaccineLiberal,"[4, 6]","""Painful Secrets"" (also called ""Secret Cutting"") is a made-for-TV movie that originally aired on the USA Network cable channel on May 30, 2000. It is VERY, VERY LOOSELY based on Steven Levenkron's teen novelThe Luckiest Girl in the Worldand is about the very real & important issue of self-injury in which its sufferers deliberately cut, burn or otherwise hurt themselves in order to cope & deal with their lives and its difficulties & traumas.Self-mutilation (another term for self-injury) is an increasingly prevalent phenomenon that occurs primarily with teenage girls (though it DOES affect those of other age groups and/or genders). It is differentiated from suicide attempts in that self-injurers do NOT have any overt intent to kill themselves (though admittedly, for some or many self-mutilators [including myself], any accidental death resulting from self-injury would've been/would be an ""added bonus"") and instead just hurt themselves as a coping mechanism.Unlike those who are able to express their feelings & emotions (especially ""extreme emotions"") through words or tears, for those who are self-injurers, hurting themselves is the only outlet to deal with pain & trauma, and be able to cope and go on living. As ironic as it sounds, self-injury provides relief by distracting us from the emotional pain (which we can NOT control) and replacing it with physical pain that we CAN control.As a recovering ""cutter"", I'd read not only Steven Levenkron'sCutting: Understanding and Overcoming Self-Mutilationand his novel, ""The Luckiest Girl in the World"", but also Karen Conterio & Wendy Lader's bookBodily Harmand Marilee Strong's bookA Bright Red Screamas well as Dr. Armando Favazza's bookBodies under Siegeand a few novels about self-mutilation.However, back when I was self-injuring -- primarily during my teens (in high school during the early to mid 90s) and for several years thereafter, there was little to NO information or awareness about the issue of self-injury. As far as I can remember, there were no books about this issue -- and in fact the only mention of self injurious behavior were either about those with autism who engaged in repetitive head-banging & other similar behavior, OR those who committed major self-mutilation like amputating limbs and practiced self-flagellation as religious rituals or for other purposes. But there was little to nothing about ""cutters"" and other self-mutilation -- and back then, though the Internet was in existence it was not yet in as widespread use as it is today (Only a small number of people were connected to the World Wide Web and even then it was with an extremely slow dial-up Internet connection using the phone line)There was literally NO information whatsoever about self injury available anywhere!So, there was a LOT of stigma, discrimination and myths about it -- so much so that any time any teachers & school administration (principal, etc.) discovered cuts or scars, I was kicked out of school  for days/weeks at a time. With ZERO thought or concern for how it would effect my education & academic progress, as well as the long-term impact it would have on my future, literally every single time they'd see any injuries they'd suspend me, or kick me out. As a result, I missed most of high school, because of self-mutilation, and then, despite not having sufficient academic credits to graduate, I was forcibly graduated against my will (just because my jerk principal didn't want to deal with a ""cutter"", any longer, though given how prevalent self-injury is, especially among teen girls, I'd be willing to bet there were other ""cutters"" in his school) which in turn, had a major negative effect on my life & basically ruined any chance at having a decent future.Which is why I'm so thankful for movies like ""Painful Secrets"" that help get issues like these out to the forefront. Because it promotes greater awareness - and that is a GOOD THING!Personally, I'm glad that books, movies & other media (like magazines, Internet websites, etc.) help bring these important issues out of the closet. That way, hopefully those directly involved with teens & those who call themselves ""experts"" (like psychiatrists & psychologists) but who actually do more harm than good, can educate themselves about issues like self-injury -- hopefully, show more (or even, ANY!) compassion & understanding (UNLIKE my ignorant, incompassionate & insensitive high school principal & teachers) to those suffering from these problems, especially so that they'd be more inclined to get help without shame or fear of ""getting in trouble"" (including getting kicked out of school [like I was] and/or locked up for days, weeks, months or longer in a mental hospital) and thus will NOT have to ""suffer in silence"" or suffer like I did and as I have.""Painful Secrets"" (aka: ""Secret Cutting"") is made-for-TV movie about a shy & withdrawn, but yet very creative and artistic loner, Dawn Cottrell (played by Kimberlee Peterson) who is picked on & victimized by the ""popular"" crowd, whose ringleader, Rebecca (played by Crystal Bubl&eacute;) is the typical ""perfect All-American girl"". Rebecca & her friends constantly bully Dawn, calling her cruel names, insulting & harassing her, and generally making her life as miserable as possible. Unfortunately her home life is no sanctuary from the hell of school, either.Dawn's mother, Joyce (played by Sean Young) is a narcissistic, social-climbing control freak with a DISTINCT vindictive side (which I'll get to, a little later!) who takes out her anger on the rest of the family. Joyce is also OBSESSED with appearances, particularly with maintaining a facade as the perfect ""All-American"" family..........ya know, the whole image of the two-parent nuclear family living in a nice house in the suburbs with a white picket fence - and a ""perfect family"" with a mom, dad, two kids, a dog (though, if I recall correctly, there was no family dog in this movie), the whole shebang. Joyce is so obsessed with perfection (or rather, the APPEARANCE of perfection) that she is totally ignorant to the abuse her daughter, Dawn endures at school and how much pain she is in - pain so intense that Dawn deliberately cuts & burns herself to cope with it.For his part, Dawn's father, Russell (played by Robert Wisden) is just as clueless as his wife - and just like her, he is  a very self-centered man, oblivious to the needs of others. He is basically a cold, aloof & remote workaholic who either lacks emotions, or is incapable of showing any emotion about anything. Even worse, Russell seems to be totally unable to show his children - and in particular, his daughter Dawn ANY affection, especially since she started puberty causing her to feel undeserving of love and leading her to seek out affection and intimacy elsewhere, namely into the arms of a 19-year-old playboy rock-star wannabe, who doesn't care one bit about her, and instead, just uses her for sex & physical gratification. If that's not bad enough, Russell is not just emotionally distant from his family, but he is physically distant as well -  making himself unavailable by spending the majority, if not all of his free time outside of work, holed up alone in his study, focused on solitary hobbies (like crafting with pieces of glass) instead of trying to spend QUALITY TIME with his family - who desperately need it!Dawn's dysfunctional family is rounded out with her younger brother, Alex (played by Cody Serpa), who frequently torments his sister. It goes well beyond the level of normal ""sibling rivalry"" - and although Alex is kind to Dawn on occasion, at other times the sheer cruelty of the things that he says to her, possibly even crosses the line into emotional & verbal abuse.The end result of everything that is happening at school and at home, leads Dawn to feel completely unloved & unlovable, which, in addition to being one of the factors that drives her to self-injury, also drives her into the arms of the aforementioned 19 year old aspiring rock star who does not really love or care about her or have any interest in her for anything other than sex.Basically, Dawn's life is (and has been) a huge letdown - a continuous series of pain & disappointments. She does not have any real friends at school - and to the contrary, is always being picked on, teased & harassed by classmates. The ""popular"" girls constantly victimize Dawn by calling her names and acting maliciously towards her. Nevertheless, when she is asked by the ""popular"" crowd to design their float for the upcoming school carnival, Dawn is initially pleased - as she is DESPERATE to ""fit in"" and be accepted. However, her hopes for acceptance are soon shattered when she overhears the ""popular girls"" gossiping about her and snickering & making fun of her behind her back, in the girls' bathroom. Devastated, Dawn runs to a private spot and cuts herself - the only way she is able to cope with the pain/trauma. Unlike most people, who are able to deal with extreme emotions outwardly through words or tears, for others, (like Dawn, myself, and thousands [or more!] of others) the only mechanism for expressing pain is through self-injury.Unfortunately, Dawn is unable to talk to her family about the harassment she suffers at school (and the agony she is in as a result) because when she tries to connect with them individually, they are incapable of communicating effectively with each other. Russell is distant, and cannot express any type of emotion or intimacy towards his daughter, putting up an air of passivity while Joyce, on the other hand, is so narcissistic, that it is impossible for Dawn to discuss anything, without Joyce immediately relating it back to herself, thus constantly taking the focus away from Dawn, where it should be. As for her brother, Alex, he is more interested in insulting her (and later on, blaming her) than trying to understand and help his sister.So, feeling like a failure, unable to ""fit in"" anywhere, Dawn finds solace in the one thing in her life that she IS able to control - her body and her secret self-injury. Because of their narcissism, Mr & Mrs Cottrell are totally oblivious to Dawn's suffering. But it all soon comes out when further humiliating experiences at school sends Dawn in search of privacy so she can cut herself to deal with the stress and numb the emotional pain. However this time, Dawn's self-injury is discovered by Lorraine, another social outsider in Dawn's school, with whom she can certainly relate. That is almost immediately followed by a well-meaning teacher who notices blood on Dawn's shirt sleeve, and reports it to the school administration who calls Dawn's parents to school to discuss her injuries.Humiliated that their facade as a perfect all-American family has been shattered somewhat publicly (in front of the school administration), Dawn's narcissistic mother once again brings the focus of the situation back to her by insisting that she does not want to be blamed for Dawn's problems. Joyce fails to recognize that her daughter requires someone to understand her by listening to what she has to say. Meanwhile, Russell remains distant and emotionless as usual thinking only of himself and afraid that he will be blamed for Dawn's self-harm. Just like with his wife, to whom appearances and total control are everything, Russell is very obsessed how he is portrayed to others. For example, in one scene, Dawn is at the ER after injuring herself (if I recall correctly, after burning herself with a cigarette lighter) and the doctor treating her, mentions that many of those who self-injure had (or have been) abused and/or sexually molested. But rather than being focused on Dawn & the pain she is in that drives her to self-mutilation, Russell is more worried about making sure that Dawn tells the doctor that he never touched her (in regards to the mention of abuse & molestation) and that Dawn is able to convince the doctor of that - as if  (especially in light of everything else that has happened) THAT is still the most important thing!Rather than actually trying to HELP her daughter, like a caring & loving parent would, by dealing with the problem like an intelligent adult, instead, Dawn's mother, reacts by just hiding all the knives & other sharp objects in the house, and conducting strip-searches in order to inspect her daughter's body for new injuries. When naturally, that doesn't work (Dawn just finds other things to injure herself with - and she does it in places where her mother does not check, like those covered by her underpants) Joyce's vindictive side shines through loud & clear, with her going so far as to even tell the mother of Rebecca (played by Crystal Bubl&eacute;) Dawn's primary tormentor at school, that Dawn is a self-injurer, giving that cruel bully & the rest of her clique EVEN MORE ammunition to use against Dawn - which, of course, they do, taunting her, calling her ""Dawn CUT-trell"" (instead of Dawn Cottrell), and harassing her with mocking questions about self-injury.Meanwhile, Dawn's new friend, Lorraine, introduces Dawn to her psychiatrist, Dr. Parella (Rhea Perlman) who seems to be the only understanding voice in the torment of Dawn's volatile and painful world. Realizing there is no alternative for their daughter, Russell & Joyce agree to allow Dawn to begin counseling with Dr. Parella. Through counseling, Dawn slowly begins to understand that the nature of her disorder stems not simply from her constant feelings of abandonment by the people she loves, but also from her inability to express this pain through verbal channels. Instead, Dawn uses cutting to communicate what she feels inside. Her inability to communicate individually with her parents (as well as their inability to communicate with one another) leaves any hope of emotional support for Dawn unattainable.Between the torment she endures at school, and the dysfunctional family & home life, Dawn is at (or very nearly at) the breaking point - and it all comes to a head when Dawn learns that her new (and really, only) friend, Lorraine was brutally beaten by her mother's boyfriend (and by Joyce's refusal to take her to the hospital to visit Lorraine). With (in Dawn's mind), no one left to turn to, she resorts to even more desperate and destructive measures and soon winds up back in the emergency room, this time with very serious injuries - and the only question is whether therapist can save Dawn from herself before its too late??""Painful Secrets"" (aka: ""Secret Cutting"") is a movie that gives viewers an insightful look into a disorder that for years has been disregarded or shunned because people simply were not ready or able to deal with the fairly prevalent issue of self-injury.Which is one reason that I was very interested in this movie -- and I not only watched it, but also taped it (on VHS tape, since back then [in 2000] IIRC, I don't think I even had a PLAYER for DVDs, let alone a DVD recorder!) when it first premiered on the USA Network in May of 2000, under the title, ""Secret Cutting"", before the movie was later renamed ""Painful Secrets"".However, even before I actually saw the movie on TV , I had a feeling that the casting would not be good when I saw Rhea Perlman being interviewed about the movie, on one of the morning shows or talk shows and I heard that she would be playing the role of the therapist. I thought that, casting Rhea in that role was a RIDICULOUS choice, and if that was a representation of the judgment of the casting directors, that for most part the other characters would probably be no better - and I was unfortunately right. For the most part, the casting of the characters was just AWFUL!!Now don't get me wrong, I have absolutely NOTHING against Rhea Perlman!Rhea is an ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL actress in COMEDIC roles. For example, I LOVED her as the ditzy, selfish & self-centered trashy bimbo wife in the movieMatilda- and THAT is where her strengths lie, in comedy, NOT in dramas about important issues (like this movie). Comedic talents aside, Rhea is just NOT good in serious roles. Which is why, in my opinion, she's totally unsuited to play the part of the therapist, Dr. Parella, in this movie. I mean every single time I saw Rhea, and her different (and what seemed like to me, totally goofy!) facial expressions and body language, I got the urge to burst into laughter -- which, of course is the opposite intent of a movie like this that deals with a very serious (and potentially deadly) issue.A better casting choice for the role of the therapist, would be someone whose demeanor (as well as appearance) exudes compassion & empathy such as Nancy Lee Grahn (who plays ""Alexis Davis"" [aka Natasha Cassadine] on the ABC soap ""General Hospital"", and appeared as ""Principal Russell"" on 6 episodes during the first 4 seasons of7th Heaven, among other TV show & film roles) OR Teryl Rothery (ofStargate SG-1who has acted in MANY, MANY made-for-TV movies). There are numerous other actresses who would have been better in this role than Rhea Perlman. Actresses like Patti LuPone (who played the mother, ""Libby Thatcher"" onLife Goes On) Veronica Hamel, Pam Dawber, Stepfanie Kramer, Lucie Arnaz and a few others would likely have been good choices for this role. Even Sean Young (who played the mother of the main character in this film) would have been a much better casting choice for the part of the therapist.Unfortunately, the bad casting choices did not end with Rhea Perlman. The main character in this movie, Dawn Cottrell, was played by Kimberlee Peterson - another HORRIBLE choice for the starring role!Once again (just as with Rhea Perlman), I have nothing against Kimberlee Peterson. I think she is a great budding actress, and I really enjoyed her in other roles, such as when she guest starred for several episodes as a homeless teen, on ""Boston Public"", and when she appeared onStrong Medicine. But she was just NOT right for the role of Dawn.For one thing, and I mean no offense by this, but she looks & acts like a totally insane freak. Especially with her constant raised eyebrow expression (which is extremely annoying and distracting) and the way she becomes so excited (nearly to the point of being giddy or like she manic), while self-injuring, it just reinforces the FALSE myth that those who mutilate themselves, are just ""insane, psycho freaks"". Worse, it perpetuates the stigma and discrimination against those of us, who have deliberately injured ourselves at one time or another, whether to distract ourselves from stress, other trauma, to feel more alive (as ironic as that sounds), to replace emotional (or other) pain with physical pain, or even just cope with difficult lives.Kimberlee Peterson is a good actress but she is totally wrong for this part and there's numerous better choices of actresses for this role including Kellie Martin (of ER, ""Life Goes On"", and TV movies), Jennie Garth or Tori Spelling (of ""Beverly Hills 90210""), Jessica Biel (of ""7th Heaven"", and various movies) and Jessica Bowman (of ""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"" and TV movies).Other good choices for this role include Candace Cameron-Bure (of ""Full House"" ), Katie Wright (of Melrose Place, and various made-for-TV movies), Alicia Leigh Willis (of ""7th Heaven"") and Ariana Richards. Even Crystal Bubl&eacute; (who played the part of a cruel bully, Rebecca in this movie) would have been a better casting choice for the part of Dawn Cottrell than Kimberlee Peterson.The casting of the other characters in this movie ranged from mediocre (Dawn's father, Mr. Cottrell) or average (Mrs. Cottrell, the school personnel, etc.) to EXCELLENT (Lorraine, Alex)Though this is a good movie, because the casting for a majority of the characters was just AWFUL, it really took away from what would have otherwise been a great, informative, and important movie.",3,Made-for-TV Movie about a
