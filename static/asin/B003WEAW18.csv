1369068,A2HAHZKW9IFGZ4,B003WEAW18,David B. Riggins,"[0, 0]","Just finished watching &#34;Lark Rise to Candleford&#34; on Prime instant video.  My take on the series was that it started well, and was at it's best when dealing with the changes facing a rural population at the edge of industrialization, and the resulting social issues that were arising from the mixing of town and country due to changing from an agrarian to industrial economy. Queenie realizing there was no market for her skills, but showing Ruby how to make lace, for instance, was an incredibly powerful piece.  The effects of measles on the hamlet, and the helplessness of choosing between one's children and one's livelihood speaks to the pain so many families today have when faced with employers that don't offer time off for family health issues. By season four, however, the show had dissolved into little more than a soap opera about the life of the spinster postmistress, with comic relief from her silly sidekick, Minnie. Laura had become a whining caricature, and the one of the strongest characters, Robert, had presumably hired off to Downton Abbey. There was a lot of potential in Lark Rise, that might have helped explain that important pivot point of the later half of the 19th century, seen through the eyes of a small community, but it was lost in brainless fluff.",3,It could have been sooo much better...,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,1290,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', '34', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', '34', 'Prime', 'instant', 'video', 'take', 'series', 'was', 'started', 'well', 'was', 'best', 'when', 'dealing', 'changes', 'facing', 'rural', 'population', 'edge', 'industrialization', 'resulting', 'social', 'issues', 'were', 'arising', 'mixing', 'town', 'country', 'due', 'changing', 'agrarian', 'industrial', 'economy', 'Queenie', 'realizing', 'there', 'was', 'market', 'skills', 'showing', 'Ruby', 'how', 'make', 'lace', 'instance', 'was', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'piece', 'effects', 'measles', 'hamlet', 'helplessness', 'choosing', 'one', 'children', 'one', 'livelihood', 'speaks', 'pain', 'so', 'many', 'families', 'today', 'have', 'when', 'faced', 'employers', 'do', ""n't"", 'offer', 'time', 'family', 'health', 'issues', 'season', 'four', 'however', 'show', 'had', 'dissolved', 'little', 'more', 'soap', 'opera', 'life', 'spinster', 'postmistress', 'comic', 'relief', 'silly', 'sidekick', 'Minnie', 'Laura', 'had', 'become', 'whining', 'caricature', 'one', 'strongest', 'characters', 'Robert', 'had', 'presumably', 'hired', 'off', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'was', 'lot', 'potential', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'explain', 'important', 'pivot', 'point', 'later', 'half', '19th', 'century', 'seen', 'eyes', 'small', 'community', 'was', 'lost', 'brainless', 'fluff']",Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Collection

Buy them separately on Amazon and SAVE $$$.English country life could never have been as poetic, pictorial, and enchanting as this dramatization of the lives of those living in and around the two 1880's towns of Lark Rise and Candleford. Even the DVD's music puts a sanguine sugarcoating on the period. All of this is to the delight of the viewer of this masterfully done TV series sure to endear any North American who has a tender video heart toward Victorian Britain. Each episode has multiple plots so it is impossible to break down the episodes into short summaries. And with carryover from one episode to another, it's more like moving to Lark Rise or Candleford and living with the good people (and the bad). A delightful scenic experience even Disney has never matched. Every emotion you have ever felt in your past will be repeated sometime throughout this English town saga.Subtitled. It is romance, nostalgia, saga, suspense, drama, well...it's a cornucopia of viewing that is not to be missed. It continues with a great and large nucleus cast, but the stories and depth of characters grow with the show's movement. Darling Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan), Lark Rise born, was sent to Candleford to learn the trade of postmistress. She is the spark caught between the two towns (sometimes world's different.) Her mentor is Dorcas (Julia Sawalha.)The cast is an assortment of either the die-hard, disheveled, working class or the Candleford higher class, shy of nobility range. Cast individuals make this memorable.  Also, be warned. Expect belly laughs too. Those Pratt sisters, Twister (OK tears too) and wife, Queenie, not to mention, Thomas the Bible-quoting, bike-riding, mail-deliverer, and his wife, Margaret could put together a comedy show every bit as good as this dramatic series has been--from day one.

(The only true downside being that this series was just stopped short at essentially a half of season four - for some strange and unanswerable reason, having absolutely nothing to do with and seemingly ignoring the fact that the show has enjoyed very high ratings and passionate fans in the UK - to the US and beyond.)I discovered this engaging series about a year ago and was entirely thrilled to have stumbled upon it. I couldn't watch every episode of the first three seasons fast enough and then promptly watched every show once more at a more leisurely and enjoyable pace. I couldn't wait for season four to arrive this year and have recently seen every episode once (and I'm about to watch them all again for the second satisfying time). I'm glad that many storyline threads were wrapped up quite nicely at the end, but still wish this series had continued through the few more seasons that it was meant to be in the first place. (Could fans bring this back in any way any time soon - either side of the pond - maybe a co-production?!)Adorned with lovely late Victorian dresses and details, complete with wonderful actors and their perfect performances, abounding with cute and quirky characters running the gamut from silly to snarky to sweet: this series of episodes (in basically three and a half seasons) offers plenty of thought-provoking and interesting themes while it evokes smiles, laughter and even some tears (at least to the sensitive of heart).The women I know who have seen it have loved it like I do, and even some men I know have watched and enjoyed it too. This series is certainly family fare. There is plenty to think about... Poverty contrasting against monetary ease. A poor hamlet sometimes in contest with a thriving town. Class structure. Old traditions versus new ideas. Neighborly and not always so very neighborly folks. Human nature and divine beliefs. Conservative thoughts opposing liberal views of that late nineteenth century day. Religion and politics, business and love. It's a cornucopia of fulfilling fun.Miss Lane and young Laura each fall in love their several times throughout, as they both think on marriage: to be or not to be. Many families and individuals take their turns facing their financial troubles and personal challenges. Characters of many types come and go within the storylines. There are wise women, careless ones, loveable but flawed individuals, caring parents, good and bad fathers, and the list goes on. Many of the actors were gone too much or too soon for my tastes. One thing for sure: what I've seen has left me wanting more; but I will thank my blessings and enjoy what was done of this wonderful series.Kerri Bennett Williamson, Author",5,"Everything wholesome, charming, delightful, funny, touching and more!",1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,2826,"['Charmingly', 'entertaining', 'series', 'wholesome', 'delight', 'vintage', 'senses', 'darling', 'start', 'sudden', 'finish', 'only', 'true', 'downside', 'being', 'series', 'was', 'just', 'stopped', 'short', 'essentially', 'half', 'season', 'four', 'strange', 'unanswerable', 'reason', 'having', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'seemingly', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'high', 'ratings', 'passionate', 'fans', 'UK', 'US', 'discovered', 'engaging', 'series', 'year', 'ago', 'was', 'entirely', 'thrilled', 'have', 'stumbled', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'episode', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'fast', 'enough', 'then', 'promptly', 'watched', 'show', 'once', 'more', 'more', 'leisurely', 'enjoyable', 'pace', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', 'four', 'arrive', 'year', 'have', 'recently', 'seen', 'episode', 'once', ""'m"", 'watch', 'again', 'second', 'satisfying', 'time', ""'m"", 'glad', 'many', 'storyline', 'threads', 'were', 'wrapped', 'up', 'quite', 'nicely', 'end', 'still', 'wish', 'series', 'had', 'continued', 'few', 'more', 'seasons', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'first', 'place', 'Could', 'fans', 'bring', 'back', 'way', 'time', 'soon', 'side', 'pond', 'maybe', 'co-production', 'Adorned', 'lovely', 'late', 'Victorian', 'dresses', 'details', 'complete', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'perfect', 'performances', 'abounding', 'cute', 'quirky', 'characters', 'running', 'gamut', 'silly', 'snarky', 'sweet', 'series', 'episodes', 'basically', 'three', 'half', 'seasons', 'plenty', 'thought-provoking', 'interesting', 'themes', 'smiles', 'laughter', 'even', 'tears', 'least', 'sensitive', 'heart', 'women', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'loved', 'do', 'even', 'men', 'know', 'have', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'too', 'series', 'certainly', 'family', 'fare', 'plenty', 'think', 'Poverty', 'contrasting', 'monetary', 'ease', 'poor', 'hamlet', 'sometimes', 'contest', 'thriving', 'town', 'Class', 'structure', 'Old', 'traditions', 'versus', 'new', 'ideas', 'Neighborly', 'not', 'always', 'so', 'very', 'neighborly', 'folks', 'Human', 'nature', 'divine', 'beliefs', 'Conservative', 'thoughts', 'opposing', 'liberal', 'views', 'late', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'day', 'Religion', 'politics', 'business', 'love', 'cornucopia', 'fulfilling', 'fun.Miss', 'Lane', 'young', 'Laura', 'fall', 'several', 'times', 'think', 'marriage', 'be', 'not', 'be', 'Many', 'families', 'individuals', 'take', 'turns', 'facing', 'financial', 'troubles', 'personal', 'challenges', 'Characters', 'many', 'types', 'come', 'go', 'storylines', 'are', 'wise', 'women', 'careless', 'ones', 'loveable', 'flawed', 'individuals', 'caring', 'parents', 'good', 'bad', 'fathers', 'list', 'Many', 'actors', 'were', 'gone', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'tastes', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'will', 'thank', 'blessings', 'enjoy', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'wonderful', 'series.Kerri', 'Bennett', 'Williamson', 'Author']",Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Collection

She who pretends to know everything and is sooooo...friendly and neighborly with everyone.  She has had good marriage prospects time and time again, and even loved them...one at a time of course...but when she did finally marry, it was to some...loser!As far as the other characters in the series, especially those from Lark Rise, is that how the English people really lived?  Were they really that stupid?  The BBC has time and time again projected the English people of the past as jokes.  Why would they do that?  The writers of this saga did not do their history.  If they had, they would have found out that so many things they are portraying about these people and their lifestyles just simply did not exist.To know the history of that time is to know they could not in all honesty praise it to high heaven!  I have done my homework and I know that the writer(s) of this series took an ungodly amount of artistic license.  Do not believe half of what you see and hear in this saga.  Another thing.  I paid $42.99 for the complete series last month, and just days after I noticed the price was $142.99.  The price increased by 66% in a matter of days!  I ask you, is that right?There are some good subject matters in this film series, but the bad seriously outweighs the good.  I have lived long enough to know that what I say here is the truth.In the 4th season, there was the annual fair held...in downtown Candleford of all places.  Those annual fairs did exist, but there was a field set aside for that purpose.  If a woman like Caroline Arless has pulled half the stunts as this one is portrayed to have pulled, she would have been run out of town on a rail. There is no way the people would have condoned her actions.  And the interfering in other peoples lives to such an extent as this?  Come on!  And for people to have had children out of wedlock and not be outcasts;  that was not the way it was.

1369132,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B003WEAW18,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season One is a charming series that tackles myriad themes, and is adapted from Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel. In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha who was also brilliant in her role as Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)). Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and uptight Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.By the second season, both Sir Timothy and Lady Adelaide have moved to London, but there is still plenty of drama in Dorcas' life with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former inhabitant of Lark Rise, a local boy who has done well in life. Being a self-made and wealthy man, James settles in Candleford, though he reacquaints himself with the residents of Lark Rise, especially Queenie Turrill (Linda Bassett) who used to take care of him as a young boy. James opens a fashionable hotel in Candleford, and tries to 'improve' the lives of the Lark Rise residents with mixed results. There is also strong chemistry between James and Dorcas, though their relationship flounders between attraction and rivalry/conflict. Laura seems more mature and wiser, having learned a couple of enlightening things about the pitfalls of romance, and is taking on more responsibilities at the post office. But then, a young clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he seems oblivious to her charms. Laura's parents, Robert and Emma Timmins (Brendan Coyle & Claudie Blakley) who have always been a very close and loving couple find themselves facing some marital strife in their marriage, and this second season takes an intimate look at their dynamics as a couple.There is also plenty of drama amongst the other inhabitants of Lark Rise & Candleford - the sisters Pearl and Ruby Pratt (Matilda Ziegler, Victoria Hamilton) who have a dressmaking/drapery store continue to pry into others' affairs whilst dealing with their own emotional dramas. Postman Thomas Brown's (Mark Heap)romantic (mis)adventures continue, and many more.Season Three sees the introduction of a significant new character, Daniel Parrish (played by Ben Aldridge), a young journalist who arrives in Lark Rise with some life-altering news for the Timmins. Emma (Claudie Blakley) might inherit a fortune, and both Emma and her husband Robert (Brendan Coyle) ponder the possibilities and opportunities this signifies for them as a family. Parrish is also drawn to Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) who has matured into a true beauty.The independent and strong-willed Dorcas Lane (played by the talented and lovely Julia Sawalha) continues as Candleford's postmistress, and experiences some human drama of her own, taking on a role that she finds fulfills her immensely. Unlike previous seasons, Dorcas' story is no longer the only dominant thread this season, as other characters begin to get more screen time (yes, I was not too pleased with this, but I felt some of these stories were still well done). One story arc which I particularly enjoyed watching was the marital adventures of postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) and his devoted wife Margaret Ellison (Sandy McDade). Their antics just make me laugh out loud, and yet there is also a poignancy to their marriage which is explored later in the season. This balance makes them an interesting couple to watch on-screen and the actors outdo themselves in lending credibility and depth to their characters.Minnie, the bumbling yet lovable maid from Season 2 is given a meatier role this season, and I loved how Dorcas takes Minnie under her wing, grooming her not for a life of servitude but for something far more worthy and fulfilling, with mixed results - a blend of hilarity and poignancy that had me laughing one moment and tearing up the next.Strong and resilient Emma Timmins also gets a chance to explore other sides to her role - she is not just a loving mother and loyal wife this season, but yearns to be something more which I felt rounded-out her character very nicely this season. One of the story arcs I've loved throughout seasons 1-3 is the strong bond of love between Robert and Emma Timmins, one which is further explored this season.The Pratt sisters, Ruby and Pearl (Victoria Hamilton and Matilda Zeigler) continue their roles as town busybodies and this season sees a major upheaval which threatens the sisters formerly close knit bond with each other. Young Alf Arless (John Dagliesh, also one of my favorite characters after Dorcas and Robert) begins to mature into his role as the head of his family, assuming real responsibilities, but also faces some serious and heartbreaking challenges.This season also sees the inhabitants of Lark Rise and Candleford coming together in a time of crisis, helping each other out, and setting aside their differences which I felt was timely and touching. The stories make you feel like you're there, experiencing these people's joys and pains, their triumphs and failures, and the slowly developing sense of community between both hamlets.In the final season i.e. Season Four, viewers only get to watch six episodes. There is also a significant absence in the form of actor Brendan Coyle (who played Robert Timmins). In the story, Robert's character is portrayed as having gone off to work elsewhere to send money home to his family (in actual fact, actor Brendan Coyle had landed a meaty role in the period drama Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey. The first episode sees the introduction of a new character Gabriel Cochrane (Richard Harrington)who has lost his once flourishing foundry business to the bank and who is also recently widowed. Luckily for Gabriel, Dorcas offers him a job and a home and the people of Candleford welcome him into their fold. Gabriel however is intent on reclaiming his former position and vows to get back at the people who have cost him his livelihood. Emma Timmins finds herself at wits' end when the money sent by her husband Robert is lost by her son Edmund. In the second episode, Daniel Parrish who runs the local paper, organizes a poetry writing competition and Laura gets upset when there is insinuation of favoritism toward her (since Daniel and Laura are courting). In the third episode, Thomas the postman is ecstatic when he is put in charge of the church bazaar but clashes with the new reverend, forward thinking curate Reverend Marley. The reverend's relationship with Emma Timmins also gives rise to gossip. In the fourth episode, Alf and Minnie's love is tested when Alf wins the title King of the Fair and Queenie finds herself upset at Twister when he does something behind her back, involving a pig Queenie won. Episode Five revolves around a cricket match where Daniel is intent on victory against a neighboring town. Only problem is that Daniel's fledgling team lacks superior players, until he finds an unexpected star player. The final episode sees Gabriel working on an invention that may restore his wealth and standing, and it also focuses on the developing attraction between Gabriel and Dorcas. But are these two strong-willed and fiercely independent souls too independent-minded for their own good?Frankly, I was rather underwhelmed by this final season. The actors did an amazing job in their roles, yet the stories just appeared to lack the extra 'something' that made the previous three seasons so special and incredibly addictive. None of the episodes in this season (well, except for the final episode perhaps) seemed to engage me as deeply as some of the episodes in the previous seasons - the exploration of Emma and Robert Timmins' marriage and the episode where Emma tries to assert some independence and find her own 'voice'; the romance between Thomas and Ms. Ellison (their courtship is so comical yet sweet); the episode where both Candleford and Lark Rise come together to help with the harvest and the way the two communities deal with tragedy, and many more. I also did not care much for the character Gabriel Cochrane and felt the chemistry between Dorcas and Gabriel lacked credibility.Despite the flaws in this season's episodes, I still gave it five stars if only because the acting was top-notch and the cinematography was spectacular as always. I will miss this series dearly and can only hope that the BBC will bring the cast back for at least a TV movie and tie up the loose ends - it would be a nice treat for the fans of LRTC. This boxed set is the perfect complement to any LRTC fan's DVD library.",5,Lark Rise to Candleford is my one weakness!,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,9199,"['Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'Complete',
