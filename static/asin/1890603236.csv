First the plot is laughable at best. All there is to the plot is senseless  violence and sex, that includes the murder of women and childen plus the  implied rape of a child. TThe voice cast sounds like there reading off of  cue cards! I swear no emotion what so ever. Those of you whom are expecting  any type of a hero prepare for a huge disapointment! No one in this waste  of animated cells has any shread of morality or even a basic sense of right  or wrong.

195473,A3IBYRSA490ZOA,1890603236,C. Chow,"[0, 2]","I am shocked that this film is only getting mediocre reviews. It clearly lives up to the original.The plot:  A carefully crafted presidential candidate is sure to win the 2000 election with 90% of the vote. If he lives. His life is being threatened by a major South American drug dealer Queen Bee. Assassin Golgo 13 is hired by the campaign to kill Queen Bee. This will not be an easy job for Golgo 13. Queen Bee has her own private army. Along with the action the plot thickens. Why does Queen Bee want to kill the future president? His campaign is worse than Hitler's. But true to character, Golgo 13 doesn't make moral judgments; he does the job he was paid for.I do not say this lightly but `The Professional: Golgo 13' is my favorite anime film of all time. And I've seen every anime there is. Yes even above `Totoro', `Akira', `Kite', and `Wings of Honneamise.' I loved `The Professional' because of the great plot and nonstop action. I also found the ruthlessness of Golgo 13 to interesting. A hero with NO morals what-so-ever. He just kills for money, not love or hate.`Golgo 13: Queen Bee' lives up the original, thanks to writer/director Osamu Dezaki. Golgo 13 retains its style of extreme close ups, over saturated colors and slow motion scenes. The arty action style made famous by John Woo and Ringo Lahm. At only half the length of the original `Queen Been' doesn't rush through anything. The timing is perfect. I can think of very few anime films that can hold the eye for more than an hour. Anime is best done short.As an added bonus, Queen Bee is played by voice actress Denise Poiter whom played Aeon Flux.Osamu Dezaki is hands down the greatest anime director I've ever scene.

The animation is very neat and looks great, but the cliched over the top ridiculous storyline and borderline terrible voice acting just about kills anything enjoyable with Golgo 13: Queen Bee.

With a great theme song, intricate and deep plot, and one of the coolest main characters to appear in anime, Golgo 13: Queen Bee deserves far more praise. The dubbing is top-notch, and you can even forget you're watching a dub. The artwork is incredible. Animation is good, but even better is the sheer amount of detail in this anime. It is poetry in motion. Check out the final duel with Golgo 13 and Queen Bee at the end to see what I mean. Hang around during the credits, because that's when the best scene of the movie is shown. The story itself is done in such a way that it is simple if you want it to be, and complex if you feel like thinking about it. It is all executed so well. The transition effects between scenes may take some time to get used to, but aren't too distracting at all. The only complaint I have is the amount of, uh, activity in this film. Seeing the same woman go at it with five different guys, all at the wrong times in the movie, is not my cup of tea. That's the only real flaw in this masterpiece.

IMHO, the appeal was his elaborate setup to get that 'impossible' shot; in The Professional, the interesting twist was that he was targetted to be taken out so is forced on the defensive -- chased by other high caliber (and outlandish) hitmen.here, Togo seems amateurish. there is nothing that defines him from any other hitman; the Queen Bee, herself, was not a very compelling character since they never really worked the child/children perspective of her character.there is an even greater amount of sex and violence -- probably needless as well but to me in excess -- in this OAV, more like something from Crying Freeman, as one reviewer mentioned.the plot is horribly cliche and most of the plot twists were pointless (Minor SPOILER: consider how important she put her revenge as oppose to getting funding for liberation army -- even the ending was bad, it was just a shooting gallery to complete the last contract). if you're a huge fan you're already bought it, so for everyone else, rent it on DVD and listen to the audio commentary.",3,"Togo's in it, sort of...",995500800,"07 19, 2001",2001,1698,"['good', 'news', 'Golgo', '13', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'audio', 'track', 'animation', 'line', 'character', 'designs', 'Golgo', '13.unfortunately', 'nowhere', 'near', 'compelling', 'story', 'superior', 'Golgo', '13', 'Professional', 'other', 'Duke', 'Togo', 'anime', 'released', 'Urban', 'Vision.Togo', 'never', 'technicality', ""n't"", 'here', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'seeing', 'hesitate', 'so', 'much', 'get', 'so', 'easily', 'distracted', 'have', 'so', 'many', ""'incidental"", 'blocks', 'target', ""'re"", 'fan', 'manga', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'G13', 'Professional', 'see', 'preparations', 'planning', 'score', 'hit', 'IMHO', 'appeal', 'was', 'elaborate', 'setup', 'get', ""'impossible"", 'shot', 'Professional', 'interesting', 'twist', 'was', 'was', 'targetted', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'so', 'forced', 'defensive', 'chased', 'other', 'high', 'caliber', 'outlandish', 'hitmen.here', 'Togo', 'amateurish', 'nothing', 'other', 'hitman', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'compelling', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'worked', 'child/children', 'perspective', 'character.there', 'even', 'greater', 'amount', 'sex', 'violence', 'probably', 'needless', 'as', 'well', 'excess', 'OAV', 'more', 'something', 'Crying', 'Freeman', 'one', 'reviewer', 'mentioned.the', 'plot', 'horribly', 'cliche', 'most', 'plot', 'twists', 'were', 'pointless', 'Minor', 'SPOILER', 'consider', 'how', 'important', 'put', 'revenge', 'oppose', 'getting', 'funding', 'liberation', 'army', 'even', 'ending', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'just', 'shooting', 'gallery', 'complete', 'last', 'contract', ""'re"", 'huge', 'fan', ""'re"", 'already', 'bought', 'so', 'everyone', 'else', 'rent', 'DVD', 'listen', 'audio', 'commentary']",N/A
