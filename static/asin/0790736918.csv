105881,A17JNWMQJ376R2,0790736918,49sim67,"[0, 0]","I was six years old when I saw this film with my parents during its initial release. Needless to say it left a lasting impression with me. The Searchers is one of ""the Duke's"" finest performances in the prime of a great acting career and is well worth a place in any DVD library. The action and realism are a bit dated compared to today's standards but was state of the art for the mid-1950's. Yet, the scenery, filming locations, and cinematography are timeless. The only real issue I have with the film is the use of anachronistic weapons depicted for the historical period. The film is supposed to take place from 1868 thru 1873. However, most of the weaponry shown in the film was from a later time period. Throughout the film the main characters use 1873 Colt Army or shorter barrel versions of the same pistol, and the Winchester lever action rifles look like the 1892 version. Perhaps I'm just being ""picky"", but it seems to me at best the pistols of the period would have been a 1860 Colt or 1858 Remington conversion from cap and ball to cartridge, and the Winchesters would have been the 1866 model. Yet, the historical inaccuracy does not diminish the fact that this film is one of the great definitive westerns.  I also highly recommend the book by Alan LeMay which has a much better ending than the film (no spoiler intended), however the film is a very good adaptation.

Ethan remarks about Martin's ancestry as if it was unusual. He gives a locket to Debra. Ethan's double eagles are freshly minted. [This could signify he rode with the James Gang.] Visitors drop by with news of a cattle theft. Could it be the feared Comanches? The house appears quite large inside, and well furnished. The posse follows the trail of the stolen cattle only to find them butchered. Was it a ruse to draw the armed men away? Whose home would be attacked? The returning men find fire, ashes, and bodies. Ethan, Brad, and Martin set out to search for those who attacked the family and rescue the kidnapped girls. The small group of white men are able to fight off a much larger group of Indians. Then they separate.The film follows Ethan and Martin on their search for Debbie. Brad attacked the Indians in revenge for Lucy's death. They return to the Jorgenson's home. Martin wants to join Ethan in the search for Debbie. [A $1,000 reward seems much too high.] A letter brings news to the Jorgenson family. [This is played for laughs.] We see a herd of buffalo, then a troop of cavalry. An Indian camp was massacred. Martin is now a widower. Ethan doesn't find Debbie at the Army post among the survivors. They continue to search. An old Mexican sells them news of Chief Scar. Has Debbie grown up? There is drama in the meeting, and the attack on Ethan and Martin. Ethan has made a holographic will making Martin his sole heir. Debbie is dead to him.Ethan and Martin return to the Jorgenson's home. They are wanted men for the deaths of Futterman and his men. Their daughter is set to be married to a man who is not her first choice. Martin and Charlie fight. The Cavalry arrives with news about Chief Scar being nearby.  What are Ethan's plans for Debbie? Martin wants to rescue Debbie. They attack the Comanche camp successfully. ""Let's go home."" Will there be a happy ending for all?John Wayne does not appear to be happy in this film. Was it changed much from the book? What about the charges against Ethan and Martin? What will happen to Debbie? Will Martin marry Miss Jorgenson?

I find them to be generally cliched and conventional, and rarely original. However, The Searchers is one of the greatest movies of all time and it avoids all the western cliches, telling an emotionally resonant story amid the backdrop of the uncivilized west without a single duel on an abandoned road. As a result, it has been proclaimed the King of the Westerns for years, a judgment with which I must agree.The plot is legendary. John Wayne gives a great performance as Ethan Edwards, ex-Johnnie Reb and newly returned to live quietly with his brother's family when Commanche warriors kill them all and take off his niece to be raised among them. Edwards then begins his obsessive search along with sidekick Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) to kill his niece, figuring her to be better off. The frank examination of racism in this film was unusual for the genre and time period, and the depth of the characters and their respective arcs make this film one of the greatest ever made.Unfortunately, the film is flawed. When watching it it is impossible to forget that this is a fifties-era western because of the presence of cowboy music and the cartoon-like introduction. Not that I favor changing it, but it sort of takes one out of the movie. I guess my beef is that it is a film of its times, rather than transcending it completely. Aside from this there is very little wrong with the film and it has aged well.In short, this is a movie that belongs in the collection of anyone who loves a great film, even if you, like me, don't like the western in general.

Cinematically, it is a beautiful show (and you'll see homages to it everywhere, including Star Wars). It is one of Wayne's darker roles, and one he plays well. It's not John Wayne on the screen, it's more like he was able to find the character. Jefferey Hunter and Ward Bond do a wonderful job. My only fault with the movie is that Ford wraps it up too easily. He didn't explore the dark character Wayne played enough. But the years of searching and vengence make the trip worthwhile, even if it does end a little too 'neatly.'The dvd is a bit of a dissapointment. One side is a full-screen version, and if you flip it over you can watch the wide-screen version. As with most dvds where the director and stars are dead, there is no commentary. (And I can't help but think of how great it would be to hear Ford and Wayne talk about this movie). There are some production notes that are interesting. There are 4 short 'Warner Bros. Presents' Shorts, two on one side, two on the other. They don't even touch the movie. It is a shame that there is no documentary. Ford shot seven reels of a 'Making Of', one of the first of its kind.

105893,AJO5NS0T2X23R,0790736918,"Amazon Customer ""benjamin""","[8, 10]","It is difficult to write succinctly about a film as complex and multifaceted as John Ford's THE SEARCHERS, but there can be no doubt that it is simultaneously one of the most extraordinary and one of the most unique and unusual Westerns ever made.  Contrary to what some of the reviewers have said, THE SEARCHERS it not a masterpiece of the conventional Western; it is, in fact, one of the most unconventional of Westerns.  In many ways, it is bolder and more subversive of its genre than any of the films of Sergio Leone or Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN.  The center of the film and its uniqueness is unquestionably John Wayne's titanic performance as the wrathful, haunted avenger Ethan Edwards.  Wayne, who is often - wrongly - accused of embodying the Western cliche of the upstanding yet tough-minded hero, here portrays a character as obsessively, even psychopathically, conflicted and driven as any modern protagonist (indeed, Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader have admitted that Edwards was among the inspirations for Travis Bickle in TAXI DRIVER).  It is, quite simply, one of the greatest film performances of the last century.  And, moreover, a performance which could only have been given in cinematic terms.  Most of Wayne's performance is in silence, in Ford's unrelenting closeups where, for a few brief moments, the rampaging emotions which are ripping Ethan Edwards to shreds become visible in his eyes and the lines on his weather-beaten face.  It is a masterfully etched portrait of astounding subtlety; there is perhaps no greater testament to its power than that of the greatest of all cinematic cynics, Jean-Luc Godard, who has claimed that he weeps every time he watches the film's final scenes.While Wayne is the center of this film, it incontrovertibly belongs to its director; and Ford does not shrink from attacking the borders of his favored genre any more than his leading man does.  Again, contrary to what many critics have claimed, this film is neither dated nor in need of revision in its treatment of its Indian characters.  The Comanche cheif Scar is portrayed as both equal and counterpart to Ethan Edwards, as a man also driven by revenge, in this case, the murder of his son by whites.  While they are the object of Edwards's vengeance, Indians are also portrayed as being wantonly killed and mistreated by the cavalry.  The whites and the Indians are portrayed as two peoples locked in a dance of violence, but neither is given the moral upper hand.  As John Milius once remarked, the Comanches in this film are not savages, but kings.  It is true that THE SEARCHERS is not a politically correct film in any sense, but it is far more nuanced and complex than many would like to give it credit for.  Also understandable is the dislike some may feel for a character as flawed as Ethan Edwards, who is, after all, a bully, a racist, and, it is implied, a bit of an outlaw as well.  In my view, the question is a silly one.  To reject a film on the basis of its protagonists moral unsuitability would disqualify most of the films of Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, and most other directors of the modern era.  It is hugely unfortunate that Ford's reputation has suffered because he worked in a certain time period and in a certain genre which have now fallen out of favor with the cultural arbiters of the moment.  This dissonance only leads to the unfortunate demand that films like THE SEARCHERS conform to one's demands, rather than accepting the rewards that come from taking them fully on their own terms.Most of all, in judging the film, it is important to remember that it is a tragedy, and not a simple morality play.  Ford shows all his characters as trapped and driven by their fates, not as manifestations of a cosmic good or evil.  In this sense, THE SEARCHERS is not a masterwork of conventionality, but the first modern Western.  It pushes the genre to its peak of moral and cinematic complexity, and it is a height which, I think it is safe to say, has not been reached again.",5,AN ICONIC MASTERPIECE,1096588800,"10 1, 2004",2004,4026,"['difficult', 'write', 'succinctly', 'film', 'complex', 'multifaceted', 'John', 'Ford', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'can', 'be', 'doubt', 'simultaneously', 'one', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'unusual', 'Westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'Contrary', 'what', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'SEARCHERS', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'conventional', 'Western', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'unconventional', 'Westerns', 'many', 'ways', 'bolder', 'more', 'subversive', 'genre', 'films', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'center', 'film', 'uniqueness', 'unquestionably', 'John', 'Wayne', 'titanic', 'performance', 'wrathful', 'haunted', 'avenger', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'Wayne', 'who', 'often', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'embodying', 'Western', 'cliche', 'upstanding', 'yet', 'tough-minded', 'hero', 'here', 'character', 'obsessively', 'even', 'psychopathically', 'conflicted', 'driven', 'modern', 'protagonist', 'indeed', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'have', 'admitted', 'Edwards', 'was', 'inspirations', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'TAXI', 'DRIVER', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'greatest', 'film', 'performances', 'last', 'century', 'moreover', 'performance', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'cinematic', 'terms', 'Most', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'silence', 'Ford', 'unrelenting', 'closeups', 'where', 'few', 'brief', 'moments', 'rampaging', 'emotions', 'are', 'ripping', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'shreds', 'become', 'visible', 'eyes', 'lines', 'weather-beaten', 'face', 'masterfully', 'etched', 'portrait', 'astounding', 'subtlety', 'perhaps', 'greater', 'testament', 'power', 'greatest', 'cinematic', 'cynics', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'who', 'claimed', 'time', 'film', 'final', 'scenes.While', 'Wayne', 'center', 'film', 'incontrovertibly', 'director', 'Ford', 'not', 'shrink', 'attacking', 'borders', 'favored', 'genre', 'more', 'leading', 'man', 'Again', 'contrary', 'what', 'many', 'critics', 'have', 'claimed', 'film', 'neither', 'dated', 'need', 'revision', 'treatment', 'Indian', 'characters', 'Comanche', 'cheif', 'Scar', 'portrayed', 'equal', 'counterpart', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'man', 'also', 'driven', 'revenge', 'case', 'murder', 'son', 'whites', 'are', 'object', 'Edwards', 'vengeance', 'Indians', 'are', 'also', 'portrayed', 'being', 'wantonly', 'killed', 'mistreated', 'cavalry', 'whites', 'Indians', 'are', 'portrayed', 'two', 'peoples', 'locked', 'dance', 'violence', 'given', 'moral', 'upper', 'hand', 'John', 'Milius', 'once', 'remarked', 'Comanches', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'savages', 'kings', 'true', 'SEARCHERS', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'film', 'sense', 'far', 'more', 'nuanced', 'complex', 'many', 'would', 'like', 'give', 'credit', 'Also', 'understandable', 'dislike', 'may', 'feel', 'character', 'as', 'flawed', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'who', 'bully', 'racist', 'implied', 'bit', 'outlaw', 'as', 'well', 'view', 'question', 'silly', 'one', 'reject', 'film', 'basis', 'protagonists', 'moral', 'unsuitability', 'would', 'disqualify', 'most', 'films', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'most', 'other', 'directors', 'modern', 'era', 'hugely', 'unfortunate', 'Ford', 'reputation', 'suffered', 'worked', 'certain', 'time', 'period', 'certain', 'genre', 'have', 'now', 'fallen', 'favor', 'cultural', 'arbiters', 'moment', 'dissonance', 'only', 'unfortunate', 'demand', 'films', 'SEARCHERS', 'conform', 'one', 'demands', 'rather', 'accepting', 'rewards', 'come', 'taking', 'fully', 'own', 'terms.Most', 'judging', 'film', 'important', 'remember', 'tragedy', 'not', 'simple', 'morality', 'play', 'Ford', 'characters', 'trapped', 'driven', 'fates', 'not', 'manifestations', 'cosmic', 'good', 'evil', 'sense', 'SEARCHERS', 'not', 'masterwork', 'conventionality', 'first', 'modern', 'Western', 'genre', 'peak', 'moral', 'cinematic', 'complexity', 'height', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'not', 'been', 'reached', 'again']",N/A

This film was made in the era when political correctness was not recasting history into something that never existed.A lone rider approaches a remote homestead in the American Southwest in 1868 where the only true love of Ethan still lived with his brother and his family scratching a living from the cruel desert raising cattle. Ethan quickly reveals himself to be a bitter, hard man from his Civil War service as a Confederate soldier. He also reveals himself to be highly prejudiced against Indians, but his prejudice is borne from sad experience as he reveals his knowledge of Indian culture and especially murder raids.When his brother and his family are massacered by raiding Indians, it was discovered his two neices were kidnapped by the Indians. An enraged Ethan sets out to trail the Indians and make sure his nieces were not allowed to become part of the tribe life. Ethan grudgingly lets a young man played by Jeffrey Hunter who raised by his brother's family and was with Ethan investigating an Indian raid to accompany him on his quest for vengeance.Thus began a tale of trailing the Indians who had his niece over a period of several years with Ethan being obsessed with finding and killing his niece rather than letting her be raised as an indian. The Searchers was most appropriate as a title for the move.There are many tense moments as well as humorous times as the tale unfolds and the wanderings of the two men is narrated by Jeffrey Hunter. Ultimately, the two men catch up with the tribe and the planned retribution is at hand. Can Ethan really kill his niece?The end scene to this movie has been called one of the very best in all of movie making.I have watched this film so many times I can't count them.

Not one nomination, not even for that glorious cinematography.  Not that film should be graded according to their Oscar success, but it is an odd thing to see an English film this heavily regarded completely Oscarless.  When you consider that John Ford was right up Oscar's ally, it becomes all the more confusing.  Sight unseen, it was a weird fact.  Having seen the film, it's all the stranger.This is a great movie!I'm not a giant fan of the Western or of John Wayne, but in all honesty this could very well be the crowning achievement for both the genre and the actor.The film tells the story of a confederate veteran who has a deeply rooted hatred for the Cherokee people who becomes drawn into the search for his young niece who was kidnapped by Comanches.  Tagging along in his search is Martin Pawley, the adopted brother to the kidnapped who just so happens to be half Cherokee and also happens to have a past with Ethan.  The two butt-heads the whole way, mainly because of Ethan's gruff exterior and blind hatred and racism, but eventually things begin to soften and the heart of these men is exposed.The evolution of Ethan, while not always pretty, is a really smart and insightful look at the horrible effect that racism and a calloused heart can have on someone.  The film's climax and the eventual revelation of the kidnapped niece and Ethan's surprising reaction to her is astonishing and really colors in all of the edges to this `at times' mysterious presence.  Wayne's performance is wonderful.  I truly didn't expect anything great from him (mostly because he seemed to regurgitate the same performance over and over) but here he adds so much depth to Ethan and unravels those layers magnificently.  Jeffery Hunter is the film's low point though.  His uneven performance and use of dramatics is hard to stomach at times.  Thankfully, he is swallowed up in the grandeur of the scenes and Wayne's remarkable grounded performance.From a technical angle, this movie is nearly flawless.  It is the story that really makes this so wonderful.  Yes, it has some dated perceptions and is a victim of the `times' as it were, especially in the treatment of the `savages', but the balance act with Ethan's character helps reign in those criticisms, because it loses a `one note' or `one sided' aspect and gains another layer.",5,One of the best that truly is...,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,2509,"['love', 'how', 'John', 'Ford', 'classic', 'Western', 'Searchers', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'GREATEST', 'Western', 'time', 'yet', 'was', 'completely', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'back', '1956', 'Not', 'one', 'nomination', 'not', 'even', 'glorious', 'cinematography', 'Not', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'graded', 'according', 'Oscar', 'success', 'odd', 'thing', 'see', 'English', 'film', 'heavily', 'regarded', 'completely', 'Oscarless', 'When', 'consider', 'John', 'Ford', 'was', 'right', 'up', 'Oscar', 'ally', 'more', 'confusing', 'Sight', 'unseen', 'was', 'weird', 'fact', 'Having', 'seen', 'film', 'stranger.This', 'great', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'giant', 'fan', 'Western', 'John', 'Wayne', 'honesty', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'genre', 'actor.The', 'film', 'story', 'confederate', 'veteran', 'who', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'hatred', 'Cherokee', 'people', 'who', 'drawn', 'search', 'young', 'niece', 'who', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'Comanches', 'Tagging', 'along', 'search', 'Martin', 'Pawley', 'adopted', 'brother', 'kidnapped', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'half', 'Cherokee', 'also', 'have', 'past', 'Ethan', 'two', 'butt-heads', 'whole', 'way', 'mainly', 'Ethan', 'gruff', 'exterior', 'blind', 'hatred', 'racism', 'eventually', 'things', 'begin', 'soften', 'heart', 'men', 'exposed.The', 'evolution', 'Ethan', 'not', 'always', 'pretty', 'really', 'smart', 'insightful', 'look', 'horrible', 'effect', 'racism', 'calloused', 'heart', 'can', 'have', 'someone', 'film', 'climax', 'eventual', 'revelation', 'kidnapped', 'niece', 'Ethan', 'surprising', 'reaction', 'astonishing', 'really', 'colors', 'edges', 'times', 'mysterious', 'presence', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'truly', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'great', 'mostly', 'seemed', 'regurgitate', 'same', 'performance', 'here', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'Ethan', 'unravels', 'layers', 'magnificently', 'Jeffery', 'Hunter', 'film', 'low', 'point', 'uneven', 'performance', 'use', 'dramatics', 'hard', 'stomach', 'times', 'Thankfully', 'swallowed', 'up', 'grandeur', 'scenes', 'Wayne', 'remarkable', 'grounded', 'technical', 'angle', 'movie', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'story', 'really', 'so', 'wonderful', 'Yes', 'dated', 'perceptions', 'victim', 'times', 'were', 'especially', 'treatment', 'savages', 'balance', 'act', 'Ethan', 'character', 'reign', 'criticisms', 'one', 'note', 'one', 'sided', 'aspect', 'gains', 'layer']",N/A

105903,AG0TA24LI0XV7,0790736918,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[3, 5]","(Firstly, this is a review of the film, as opposed to the DVD or the blu-ray disc. For technical feedback, you may want to find something more specific. Just clearing that up. There are many reviews on this site and they're all different.)This is one of the greatest movies made. Obviously I'm not stating anything new or insightful by saying that. It's a known fact. Even if westerns are not your cup of tea, you must admit this is a powerful and well rendered piece of cinema.Hard to swallow that this movie garnered not one Academy Award nomination in 1956. Not for photography, score, acting? Was there a reason for this, I wonder. Possible. ""Around the World in Eighty Days"" wooed the Oscar people that year with an all-star cast and a grand and glamorous spectacle.Anyway, the places where ""The Searchers"" was shot are just breathtaking. That opening shot from the dark house to the wide open frontier has to be one of the best opening scenes in film ever. Ethan has come back to his brother Aaron's family after fighting in a war that ended three years earlier. He brings with him a quiet but seething hatred for indians (based on his demeanor towards his mixed breed nephew Martin).There's tension already but it soon gets even stronger. When Lucy lights the lamp for dinner and her mother quickly puts it out, Lucy instantly knows what is about to happen. And we get the general idea, too. Dramatic moments like this really make a movie crackle for me.""That'll be the day"" seems like Ethan Edwards' slogan. Ethan is hard to figure. He is a hero and a villain in certain ways. He is smart and sensible but at times rash and tempermental. He is capable of anything, really. He seems to be a decent fellow at heart. He is a bunch of contradictions, and so are many people, so I think we can somehow relate to this man. Most of all he is determined. But is he going to rescue his niece Debbie... or murder her? It is a long journey, and it seems nothing will stop Ethan. I think his quest is not so much about finding a family member as it is about having a purpose that he thinks is right and true.Martin knows that Ethan is capable of anything; he is concerned that Ethan may do something bad (to Debbie), for she is now basically being raised as an indian. None of this is said but you can infer it easily.Jeffrey Hunter and Vera Miles are good in their supporting roles. It's sad that they cannot be together because of the dire circumstances. How ironic that they should be reuinted accidentally on her wedding day to another man!The film keeps the viewer thoroughly engrossed because we want to know if Ethan will find the girl, or if Ethan will die at the hands of the Comanche. I have to say that John Wayne is very effective here: larger than life, likable, robust, sometimes funny, raw, and relentless.Funny how you recognize certain actors for their roles in other vehicles; a regular in many of John Wayne's movies, Hank Worden who played Mose Harper in ""The Searchers"" would go on to play the tall elderly room service clerk in the 1991 ABC-TV serial ""Twin Peaks"". His face is instantly recognizable. And  the character of guitar-playing Charlie McCorry is played by Ken Curtis, who would play the cranky and scruffy deputy Festus on ""Gunsmoke"".When I think of this film I instantly think of blue and orange; the sky and the earth. I always recall the gorgeous red sandstone rock formations of Monument Valley.The story has been compared to Homer's Odyssey; and Ethan changes over time and becomes nearly as ruthless and brutal as the ""savages"" he is bent on avenging. But does he track down Debbie? You'll have to watch to find out.Watching this movie, I just get completely involved with it and caught up in Ethan's journey. It's not just a physical journey, of course, but a journey of character and self discovery. In westerns, fight scenes and battle scenes tend to bore me, but character-driven stories really appeal to me. This one is all about the character. Ethan Edwards is as strong and memorable a character in cinema as any other: he belongs in the pantheon of greatest film characters... with Scarlett O'Hara (Gone With the Wind), Quint (Jaws), Marge Gunderson (Fargo), Atticus Finch (To Kill a Mockingbird) and Stanley Kowalski (A Streetcar Named Desire).",5,Azure Skies and Terra Cotta Frontiers,1253059200,"09 16, 2009",2009,4288,"['Firstly', 'review', 'film', 'opposed', 'DVD', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'technical', 'feedback', 'may', 'want', 'find', 'something', 'more', 'specific', 'Just', 'clearing', 'up', 'are', 'many', 'reviews', 'site', ""'re"", 'different', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'made', 'Obviously', ""'m"", 'not', 'stating', 'anything', 'new', 'insightful', 'saying', 'known', 'fact', 'Even', 'westerns', 'are', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'must', 'admit', 'powerful', 'well', 'rendered', 'piece', 'cinema.Hard', 'swallow', 'movie', 'garnered', 'not', 'one', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', '1956', 'Not', 'photography', 'score', 'acting', 'Was', 'reason', 'wonder', 'Possible', 'World', 'Eighty', 'Days', 'wooed', 'Oscar', 'people', 'year', 'all-star', 'cast', 'grand', 'glamorous', 'spectacle.Anyway', 'places', 'where', 'Searchers', 'was', 'shot', 'are', 'just', 'breathtaking', 'opening', 'shot', 'dark', 'house', 'wide', 'open', 'frontier', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'opening', 'scenes', 'film', 'ever', 'Ethan', 'come', 'back', 'brother', 'Aaron', 'family', 'fighting', 'war', 'ended', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'quiet', 'seething', 'hatred', 'indians', 'based', 'demeanor', 'mixed', 'breed', 'nephew', 'Martin', 'tension', 'already', 'soon', 'even', 'stronger', 'When', 'Lucy', 'lamp', 'dinner', 'mother', 'quickly', 'out', 'Lucy', 'instantly', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'get', 'general', 'idea', 'too', 'Dramatic', 'moments', 'really', 'make', 'movie', 'crackle', ""'ll"", 'be', 'day', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'slogan', 'Ethan', 'hard', 'figure', 'hero', 'villain', 'certain', 'ways', 'smart', 'sensible', 'times', 'rash', 'tempermental', 'capable', 'anything', 'really', 'be', 'decent', 'fellow', 'heart', 'bunch', 'contradictions', 'so', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'can', 'somehow', 'relate', 'man', 'Most', 'determined', 'going', 'rescue', 'niece', 'Debbie', 'murder', 'long', 'journey', 'nothing', 'will', 'stop', 'Ethan', 'think', 'quest', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'finding', 'family', 'member', 'having', 'purpose', 'right', 'true.Martin', 'knows', 'Ethan', 'capable', 'anything', 'concerned', 'Ethan', 'may', 'do', 'something', 'bad', 'Debbie', 'now', 'basically', 'being', 'raised', 'indian', 'None', 'said', 'can', 'infer', 'easily.Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'are', 'good', 'supporting', 'roles', 'sad', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'together', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'How', 'ironic', 'should', 'be', 'reuinted', 'accidentally', 'wedding', 'day', 'man', 'film', 'viewer', 'thoroughly', 'engrossed', 'want', 'know', 'Ethan', 'will', 'find', 'girl', 'Ethan', 'will', 'die', 'hands', 'Comanche', 'have', 'say', 'John', 'Wayne', 'very', 'effective', 'here', 'larger', 'life', 'likable', 'robust', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'raw', 'relentless.Funny', 'how', 'recognize', 'certain', 'actors', 'roles', 'other', 'vehicles', 'regular', 'many', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'Hank', 'Worden', 'who', 'played', 'Mose', 'Harper', 'Searchers', 'would', 'go', 'play', 'tall', 'elderly', 'room', 'service', 'clerk', '1991', 'ABC-TV', 'serial', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'face', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'character', 'guitar-playing', 'Charlie', 'McCorry', 'played', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'cranky', 'scruffy', 'deputy', 'Festus', 'Gunsmoke', '.When', 'think', 'film', 'instantly', 'think', 'blue', 'orange', 'sky', 'earth', 'always', 'recall', 'gorgeous', 'red', 'sandstone', 'rock', 'formations', 'Monument', 'Valley.The', 'story', 'been', 'compared', 'Homer', 'Odyssey', 'Ethan', 'changes', 'time', 'becomes', 'nearly', 'ruthless', 'brutal', 'savages', 'bent', 'avenging', 'track', 'down', 'Debbie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out.Watching', 'movie', 'just', 'get', 'completely', 'involved', 'caught', 'up', 'Ethan', 'journey', 'not', 'just', 'physical', 'journey', 'course', 'journey', 'character', 'self', 'discovery', 'westerns', 'fight', 'scenes', 'battle', 'scenes', 'tend', 'bore', 'character-driven', 'stories', 'really', 'appeal', 'one', 'character', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'strong', 'memorable', 'character', 'cinema', 'other', 'pantheon', 'greatest', 'film', 'characters', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Quint', 'Jaws', 'Marge', 'Gunderson', 'Fargo', 'Atticus', 'Finch', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Stanley', 'Kowalski', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire']",N/A

DANCES WITH WOLVES, THE OUTLAW JOSIE WALES, UNFORGIVEN, JEREMIAH JOHNSON, and OPEN RANGE are just a few westerns that have 'borrowed' from it, but THE SEARCHERS' impact transcends the genre, itself; STAR WARS, THE ENGLISH PATIENT, THE LAST SAMURAI, even THE LORD OF THE RINGS have elements that can be traced back to Ford's 1956 'intimate' epic. When you add the fact that THE SEARCHERS also contains John Wayne's greatest performance to the film's merits, it becomes easy to see why it is on the short list of the greatest motion pictures ever made.The plot is deceptively simple; after a Comanche raiding party massacres a family, taking the youngest daughter prisoner, her uncle, Ethan Edwards (Wayne), and adopted brother, Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), begin a long quest to try and rescue her. Over the course of years, a rich tapestry of characters and events unfold, as the nature of the pair's motives are revealed, and bigoted, bitter Edwards emerges as a twisted man bent on killing the 'tainted' white girl. Only Pawley's love of his 'sister' and determination to protect her stands in his way, making the film's climax, and Wayne's portrayal of Edwards, an unforgettable experience.With all of Ford's unique 'touches' clearly in evidence (the doorways 'framing' the film's opening and conclusion, with a cave opening serving the same function at the film's climax; the extensive use of Monument Valley; and the nearly lurid palette of color highlighting key moments) and his reliance on his 'stock' company of players (Wayne, Ward Bond, John Qualen, Olive Carey, Harry Carey, Jr, Hank Worden, and Ken Curtis), the film marks the emergence of the 'mature' Ford, no longer deifying the innocence of the era, but dealing with it in human terms, where 'white men' were as capable of savagery as Indians, frequently with less justification.Featuring 18-year old Natalie Wood in one of her first 'adult' roles, the sparkling Vera Miles as Pawley's love interest, Wayne's son Patrick in comic relief, and the harmonies of the Sons of the Pioneers accenting Max Steiner's rich score, THE SEARCHERS is a timeless movie experience that becomes richer with each viewing.It is truly a masterpiece!",5,"Wayne's Finest Performance, in Ford Masterpiece...",1085356800,"05 24, 2004",2004,2328,"['Even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'John', 'Ford', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'will', 'have', 'undoubtedly', 'seen', 'film', ""'style"", 'film', 'DANCES', 'WITH', 'WOLVES', 'THE', 'OUTLAW', 'JOSIE', 'WALES', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'JEREMIAH', 'JOHNSON', 'OPEN', 'RANGE', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'westerns', 'have', ""'borrowed"", 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'impact', 'genre', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'THE', 'ENGLISH', 'PATIENT', 'THE', 'LAST', 'SAMURAI', 'even', 'LORD', 'THE', 'RINGS', 'have', 'elements', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'back', 'Ford', '1956', ""'intimate"", 'epic', 'When', 'add', 'fact', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'also', 'John', 'Wayne', 'greatest', 'performance', 'film', 'merits', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'short', 'list', 'greatest', 'motion', 'pictures', 'ever', 'made.The', 'plot', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'Comanche', 'raiding', 'party', 'massacres', 'family', 'taking', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'prisoner', 'uncle', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'Wayne', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Martin', 'Pawley', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'begin', 'long', 'quest', 'try', 'rescue', 'course', 'years', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'characters', 'events', 'unfold', 'nature', 'pair', 'motives', 'are', 'revealed', 'bigoted', 'bitter', 'Edwards', 'twisted', 'man', 'bent', 'killing', ""'tainted"", 'white', 'girl', 'Only', 'Pawley', 'love', ""'sister"", 'determination', 'protect', 'stands', 'way', 'making', 'film', 'climax', 'Wayne', 'portrayal', 'Edwards', 'unforgettable', 'experience.With', 'Ford', 'unique', ""'touches"", 'clearly', 'evidence', 'doorways', ""'framing"", 'film', 'opening', 'conclusion', 'cave', 'opening', 'serving', 'same', 'function', 'film', 'climax', 'extensive', 'use', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'nearly', 'lurid', 'palette', 'color', 'highlighting', 'key', 'moments', 'reliance', ""'stock"", 'company', 'players', 'Wayne', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'John', 'Qualen', 'Olive', 'Carey', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr', 'Hank', 'Worden', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'film', 'emergence', ""'mature"", 'Ford', 'no', 'longer', 'deifying', 'innocence', 'era', 'dealing', 'human', 'terms', 'where', ""'white"", 'men', 'were', 'capable', 'savagery', 'Indians', 'frequently', 'less', 'justification.Featuring', '18-year', 'old', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'one', 'first', ""'adult"", 'roles', 'sparkling', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'Pawley', 'love', 'interest', 'Wayne', 'son', 'Patrick', 'comic', 'relief', 'harmonies', 'Sons', 'Pioneers', 'accenting', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'rich', 'score', 'SEARCHERS', 'timeless', 'movie', 'experience', 'richer', 'viewing.It', 'truly', 'masterpiece']",N/A

The movie does have several strong points.  First of all, this is Wayne's BEST performance alongside RED RIVER (1948).  Wayne's antihero, Ethan Edwards, is by no means a character to idolize.  Even Wayne himself did not like the character, but Ford was convinced that Wayne was the only one who could do the job - Henry Fonda was not the right choice for the role. Also, Ward Bond is very likeable as Reverend Clayton.  Secondly, the cinematography is brilliant, which could almost be in the same league as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962).  The scenes where Ethan and Martin Pawley search for Debbie in New Mexico territory is a prime example.  The sand dunes almost blow into your seat - almost perfectly in wide screen format.  A final strength is Max Steiner's score.  Nearly every scene has its share of high crescendos and low monotones.  Before Ethan's family is attacked, the score has an eerie feeling.  However, after Ethan returns home to find his family has been massacred, the score moves the audience to tears when they see his reaction.The film does have MANY flaws too.  First of all, the story behind Martin Pawley and Laurie Jorgenson is boring beyond belief.  Secondly, humor is NOT an antedote to this movie.  The story is a play on tragedy and should be treated as such.  Mose Harper is about as annoying as Jar Jar Binks.  There are also film editing problems.  For example, when Ethan and Martin are in Scar's teepee, the very same Comanches across the way can be seen wandering twice.  Historically, it is nice to view Monument Valley, but not when the story begins in Texas.  Also, Ford should have reviewed his historical records on Comanches - he could have learned a few things.  There are other tid bits, too. The war chief, Scar, even has body paint and Natalie Wood looks too gorgeous to be a Comanche captive - I didn't know that captives had makeup. Even the dead Comanche under the grave marker is breathing!!  All in all, Wayne should be given credit where credit is due - he did know how to act, and this movie is the pinnacle of his long career.

105914,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,0790736918,bixodoido,"[4, 5]","The Searchers tells the story of Ethan Edwards's five-year search for his kidnapped niece. John Wayne gives a great performance (many people argue its his best) as Ethan Edwards, a tough, proud Civil War veteran who refused to give up and who is forced to spend years of his life searching for his niece, Debbie. The journey, mostly set in the beautiful Monument Valley of Southern Utah, is truly a quest of epic proportions.The story is intriguing, the plot fast-moving and unpredictable, and the action exciting. Wayne's performance as Edwards shows him in a darker, more unpredictable role than many of his other films, and that sun-baked, battle-hardened face covered with stubble is a visage that, in many ways, epitomizes the rough character of the American West.The movie contains a number of stereotypes, from European settlers to Comanche Indians, that would not be considered politically correct today. Despite this, however, this is a fine film by director John Ford, one that captivates from beginning to end.

I read the book a few months ago and rated it 4.5 stars.  The book was much better.  Perhaps if there was no book, the movie would rate higher having nothing to compare it too.  I'm not sure why this movie is considered one of the best films ever made.  Maybe it's a classic by Hollywood standards for its place and time and some of the actors involved, but it's lightweight when compared to the book (perhaps an inevitability).  Is it worth a watch?  Certainly.  But please, read the book, too.  It's better... much better.  As for the movie, if you can get past the fact that the location scenery (despite its beauty) is all wrong and that the lead Indian is played by a white guy, then it gets four stars.

This movie puts him in his classic role, a big, tough American cowboy and is he good at it. This is the most complex character Wayne had ever played. The scenery is the best. Filmed in Monument Valley, it has great Indian scenes, beautiful backgrounds, and a realistic plot. But it isn't just Wayne, the supporting cast from the Jorgensens to the Edwards, they're all great. Ward Bond is great as a Rev. and as a Capt. of the Texas Rangers and just as Sam Clayton. Look for John Wayne's son! Patrick (Pat) Wayne is a young Lt. who is always getting in the way. His character adds comedy to a great dramatic film, which usually means disaster, but here it is almost impossible to look at it without it. John Ford directed it. The movie is a classic Wayne-Ford film. Those are always great. The last scene in which John Wayne is walking away from the door is a tribute to Harry Carey. His son, Harry Carey, Jr., is also in the movie as Brad Jorgensen. After seeing this movie, you will wish they would put it back on the big screen like it was in 1956.

So, you can suppose that if somewhat bad was to happen, he will  achieve a triumph over all dangers. This uses to be in vulgar movies, but ""The Searchers"" is by nothing vulgar. For what? Well, the answers are several, the magnificent landscapes, the actors, but I think over all it's the story with Ethan's contradictory personality. At first he rides a lot to get to the ranch of his brother Aaron, but there's the case in these house  exists a conflict by nothing unknown to him because Aaron's wife loves Ethan who feels he must pay his own brother for staying at the ranch and so, after a long wandering, he has to sleep scarcely only one night in the ranch. Certainly there's an apparently external  powerful reason: the cattle stolen by the Indians. The reverend wants to recruit Aaron to prosecute them, however, Ethan imposes his hard character and he goes in the place of Aaron abandoning the ranch in a first search of the comanches, I think very possibly suspecting that really these are a stratagem of Scar, the Indian chief, as his nephew Martin Pawley also fears in spite of his inexperience. This suspicion accomplish in full, and while the ranch is without defence, Aaron, Martha, his son and a few later, his daughter Lucy are horribly killed by the Indians and so it begins the main part of the movie: the searching of the only survivor, the little Debbie. This takes years to do, a lot of penalties, enemies, heat, cold, hunger... and although Ethan and Martin get to find Debbie, these are a Pyrrhic victory because the girl is yet more a Comanche squaw than a white woman. The fight isn't by far a fairplay and the hate of Ethan toward the Comanches  reach peaks of madness. The very end is also discomforting, and after the terrible search, Ethan ends out and alone as he began. Nobody needs yet his abilities and he's forgotten and more than possibly, as feared as loved by all.

105920,AKV2BGUT50B1X,0790736918,Carl Robinson,"[1, 2]","In the works of Indo-European literature there is a hero who stands outside his society, but fights viciously for it.  This hero never gets the comfort of a regular life and instead follows his fate to the end.  Siegfried, Achilles, Hercules, etc. fit this motif.  In The Searchers, Ethan (John Wayne) plays this role.The story of The Searchers comes from a true story-a Comanche raid which killed a Texas family and snatch a little girl-Cynthia Ann Parker- who is held captive for many years.  Parker's story is not unique in the early history of Texas, especially following the Civil War northern Texas was under severe threat from Indians.  In 1956, when The Searchers was made, there were still a few old-timers around that remembered Comanche raids.  Even (Senator in 1956) Lyndon Baines Johnson's family had suffered from Comanche Raids.Cynthia Ann Parker turned out to be successfully integrated into the Comanche Tribe, but she was an exception. Men and older women were killed outright or tortured to death at the time of capture, surviving girls were raped, tortured and disfigured after being returned to the Indian Camp.  The girls would also be made to toil with no end.  Thomas Goodrich, in his book Scalp Dance: Indian Warfare on the High Plains, 1865-1879 called his chapter on captivity &#34;A Fate Worse than Death.&#34;Texans during the Indian War days knew this and The Searchers excellently captures the fear and hatred of the times.  Ethan enters the story as a heroic man alone in the first scene.  He never surrendered with the Confederate Army and seems to live by robbery.  He hates Indians with the hatred of a warrior who has fought them head-on before.  He even rudely tests the racial loyalties of 1/8th Cherokee, Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) while at dinner with his family.The Comanche eventually lure the Rangers away from a settlement and kill Ethan's brother's family, leading the girls into captivity.  This is a scene of acting excellence.  The audience feels the fear of the family and the attack happens without showing the Indians, or indeed showing anything scary whatsoever, yet the suspense is heavy.Suffice to say the girls are captured and Ethan and Martin head on a quest to rescue Debbie, the lone survivor.During the quest, the nature of conflict is richly explored.  The Red-White conflict is an un-reserved fight, much like the American-Japanese conflict of the Pacific War.  The oldest captured white girl is raped and killed.  The pursuing whites mutilate bodies of fallen Comanche, the US Cavalry crashes into Indian villages shooting with no mercy, Ethan's motivations seem more to kill Indianized Debbie as much as redeem her.  The heroes also have conflicts-but muted conflicts-with other whites, Ethan's relationship with the Texas Rangers is one of barely avoiding arrest. Ethan kills a treacherous merchant, and Martin fights another man for the hand of a woman.  Through this, the conflicting and impulsive internal motives of Ethan surface and clash, making a darkly layered character.The Searchers is the last of the Westerns where the Indians are unreservedly portrayed as savages.  After 1960, Americans had no living recollection of the Indian Wars, and were instead softened by prosperity and beguiled by an elitist media ambivalent at best about the security of Americans like the whites portrayed in the movie.  After The Searchers, movies started to portray Indians as noble heroes or righteous victims of oppression.

105922,ACVBZF3GK3O45,0790736918,C. Davis,"[8, 10]","The word masterpiece gets thrown around a lot. However, one measure of artistic greatness is the ability for a work of art to communicate different things to different people at different times. When viewed in this way, it is hard to imagine The Searchers as anything but a masterpiece.I first saw this movie when I was about 13 or 14 years old on cable television. At that time, it seemed like a good western yarn set in Texas with John Wayne as the stereotypical protagonist riding off in the sunset, presumably, to kiss his horse. Indeed, Wayne has some awesome one-liners in this move. Phrases like ""Not hardly"" and ""That'll be the day"" are the ideological grandfathers of todays ""Make my day, punk"" or ""I'll be back"". As you may know (and other reviewers have pointed out), ""That'll be the day"" inspired the Buddy Holly song of the same name.Years later, this viewer was able to see deeper meanings in this morality tale.  Ultimately, this tale is not about Ethan Edwards versus the Comanche. Rather, the true conflict is between Martin Pauley (Jeffrey Hunter) and Ethan Edwards (John Wayne).  While there are whole levels of analysis about the Indians and their role in society as portrayed in the movie, they are, on some level, merely the prop (the gizmo in the box) that create the reason for the conflict of wills between Ethan and Marty.Who is Ethan Edwards? He is a character shrouded in mystery. Speaking fluent Comanche and possessing a deep understanding of their religion, culture, and lifestyle, he is for some unexplained reason filled with bitter, psychotic all-consuming hatred for all Indians, but especially Comanche. This is true even before they kill his brother's family and kidnap his two nieces. We learn this when Moses Harper talks about the Indians not missing Ethan while he was away during the Civil War. There is a strong emotional tension between Ethan and his brother's wife. One can clearly see the emotion in her eyes when Ethan returns from the Civil War and when she sends him off to take part in the hunt for rustlers/Indians who have stolen Jorgensen's cattle. Ethan seems to have an estranged relationship with his brother, offering to pay him for staying at his farm. One can only assume that Ethan had a relationship at some point with his brother's wife. Was Ethan at some point a captive of the Comanche? In that absence did the woman he loves marry his brother? Also, why did Ethan wait three years after the end of the Civil War to return home? Where did he get the large stockpile gold, unmarked and uncirculated ""Yankee"" gold coins? It is clear from his comments to the Reverend/Captain Clayton that Ethan considers the Civil War still ongoing and, indeed, when we first see Ethan, he is still wearing his uniform. Ethan further states that he doesn't believe in surrenders and he still feels his oath to the Confederacy still binding. Has he been fighting some sort of one man guerrilla war against the Union Army, attacking the wagon trains that supply the distant Forts in the West - they often had newly minted gold to pay soldiers? Did he return home because he was tired of fighting or does he intend to renew his relationship with his brother's wife? We will never know because within a day of his return home, his brother, his brother's wife, and nephew are killed by a Comanche raiding party. His two nieces are kidnapped, one dying shortly thereafter when she is presumably raped by the raiding party. Ethan becomes, if he wasn't already, obsessed with revenge. He sets out on a never ending quest to kill all Comanche to include, and especially, his niece who he believes will become more Indian then white and must be destroyed.Marty (Jeffrey Hunter) is motivated by love. Love for his adopted family. Love for life. His only desire is to find his adopted sister and free her from the Indians. One reviewer described Marty as being reasonable, but in his own way he is as obsessed as Ethan. He turns down personal wealth, not once but twice, to stay with Ethan as they hunt for the girl. The first time is when Ethan offers to let him oversee his cattle and work with Jorgensen. The second is when Ethan offers to make him a beneficiary in his will tacitly recognizing that his niece, Marty's adopted sister, is dead. Additionally, Marty risks losing the love of his life by staying on this seemingly never ending quest. Jeffery Hunter looks like a little boy, perhaps baggy wardrobe helped a bit here, next to the swaggering Wayne. His inexperience and relative physical weakness cause one to wonder how he can hope to prevail in this unrelenting battle of wills. This story ends in a way which is guaranteed to touch your heart.On a side note, while many reviewers have commented on image quality issues with this movie, this is the first time that Monument Valley was filmed in color. It is simply breath taking. This alone is worth the price of the DVD.In conclusion, there are layer after layer of stories wrapped into this excellent film. Not only is this movie appropriate for the whole family, it has themes and sub-plots that mean almost anyone can find something to like.",4,"Love vs. Hate, Hope vs. Despair",1125100800,"08 27,

It's the ONLY film that I can easily overlook it's faults that appear throughout the film. The faults I speak of are the scenes of ""cornball"" humor that are scattered all through the film. They simply don't work nor belong in this mature and intense film. Humor was NOT John Ford's forte, and he seemed to prefer the cornball variety, and granted, it did work in some of his films, but in The Searchers it was definitely out of place.Amazingly, this film is so spectacular in every other aspect, that forgiving the cornball humor is a very easy thing to do.The Searchers is not only beautiful to look at, but it's beautiful to listen to as well. This film is one of a rare handful that completely captures a specific time, place, mood and atmosphere and will suck the viewer into it's mighty vortex and put them smack dab in the middle of it. It's truly a stunning visual experience with a very complex and absorbing story, and it possesses symbolic gestures that are utilized with skill and effectiveness, never resorting to pretentiousness like most ""symbolic"" films.What more can be said about John Wayne's perfect performance in the lead role ? He was absolutely, positively born to play this role, and he turns it into a perfection personified experience. It's hard to believe there are a few misguided souls who claim Wayne wasn't a great actor. (this performance especially and several more to his resume makes those naysayers seem like babbling fools)The Searchers has rightfully been acknowledged as an American classic, and a true masterpiece of cinema, and thankfully, it's the film that many have come to admit proved John Wayne as an important actor.

105928,A2DJUBTCCEHALH,0790736918,Chimonsho,"[4, 5]","A sure sign of ""The Searchers'"" greatness is the array of thoughtful comments here.  It is complex, and enigmatic, enough to inspire widely differing views, and the substantive reviews add welcome insights. It is among the greatest Westerns, and the primal AntiWestern; Ford and Wayne's supreme collaboration; and the first half, through the winter homecoming scene, is simply as good as filmmaking gets.  (Monument Valley deserves a special Supporting Oscar; such astonishing vistas transcend mere backdrop.)  John Wayne is at his peak, though ""True Grit,"" ""Shootist"" and ""Stagecoach"" rival this among his best.  It is not uniformly brilliant; as many note, the second half drags with a romantic subplot and is no longer very funny.  But these scenes reflect Ford's conception of community; its very mundaneness highlights outcast Ethan's problematic character.  As a product of its time we may deplore its racial and gender stereotyping; these aspects do not date well and keep it from being in the same class as, say ""Seven Samurai"" which eternally satisfies on all levels.  It's still a remarkable realization of a filmmaker's vision.  John Ford's best works often have a core scene which, sans dialogue and solely through visual/musical imagery, sums up the whole film while saying something profound about the human condition.

They obviously went to great pains to digitally recapture the original color and sound of this film.I've never much cared for John Wayne movies, but this film transcends its era in some ways. The characters, particularly Wayne's, are devoid of the smarmy, sickeningly goody-goody, politically correct personalities that most westerns featured in the 40's and 50's. I see what the critics mean when they refer to The Searchers as a precursor to the Spaghetti Westerns of the late sixties and later Clint Eastwood's more hardy, morally ambiguous westerns.A family is attacked (and mostly killed) by a Native American tribe and their daughter (played by a young Natalie Wood) is adopted by the tribe. Things that I don't like: as usual in this era, Native Americans are cast as the villains with little in the way to show that atrocities between whites and Native Americans was a two-way street; also the casting of white actors as Native Americans always annoys me, but it was the convention of the times and if you can get past it, there's still a good movie to be enjoyed!The film also deals with some other interesting phenomenons: obsession, racism and the Stockholm Syndrome.

I don't agree that it's the best John Ford Western, however (any one of his Calvary trilogy can match it and for epic journey, Stagecoach is the one), but for sheer cinema muscle and a star turn by John Wayne it's a very modern treatment of the fires of conflict that blazed in the Old West, including racism, rage, and an all consuming vengeance.Filmed in full color in and around Ford's favorite location, Monument Valley and inspired by a real life incident in Texas in the early 1800s, it follows a small posse led by Wayne in a decade long search for a kidnapped white girl by a Comanche band. It's reputation as the best stems from John Wayne's heroic obsessive journey but less than heroic bloodlust, a deconstruction of the role we are used to seeing him perform, and for that he is spot on.  In this more modern view, the Great American Cowboy is stripped of his more romantic notions of prior decades and whether he is right or wrong is revealed to be more complex. Leave it to John Ford to turn the stereotype on its ear for he was one of the few who explored it early on in some of his other Westerns as well (See Henry Fonda in Fort Apache). Though Ford did help write the book on the game saving calvary charge, his relations between white frontiersmen and native Indians are seen both in black & white and as often in gray.Film fans will love all the extras and the deluxe set can be found at extremely affordable prices for this magnificent treatment.",5,The Searchers gets deluxe treatment at an affordable price.,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,1605,"['Discovered', 'film', 'enthusiastists', 'filmmakers', '3rd', 'wave', 'Scorcese', 'Penn', 'et', 'al', 'been', 'declared', 'greatest', 'Western', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'best', 'John', 'Ford', 'Western', 'however', 'one', 'Calvary', 'trilogy', 'can', 'match', 'epic', 'journey', 'Stagecoach', 'one', 'sheer', 'cinema', 'muscle', 'star', 'turn', 'John', 'Wayne', 'very', 'modern', 'treatment', 'fires', 'conflict', 'blazed', 'Old', 'West', 'including', 'racism', 'rage', 'consuming', 'vengeance.Filmed', 'full', 'color', 'Ford', 'favorite', 'location', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'inspired', 'real', 'life', 'incident', 'Texas', 'early', '1800s', 'small', 'posse', 'led', 'Wayne', 'decade', 'long', 'search', 'kidnapped', 'white', 'girl', 'Comanche', 'band', 'reputation', 'best', 'stems', 'John', 'Wayne', 'heroic', 'obsessive', 'journey', 'less', 'heroic', 'bloodlust', 'deconstruction', 'role', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'perform', 'spot', 'more', 'modern', 'view', 'Great', 'American', 'Cowboy', 'stripped', 'more', 'romantic', 'notions', 'prior', 'decades', 'right', 'wrong', 'revealed', 'be', 'more', 'complex', 'Leave', 'John', 'Ford', 'turn', 'stereotype', 'ear', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'explored', 'early', 'other', 'Westerns', 'well', 'See', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Fort', 'Apache', 'Ford', 'did', 'help', 'write', 'book', 'game', 'saving', 'calvary', 'charge', 'relations', 'white', 'frontiersmen', 'native', 'Indians', 'are', 'seen', 'black', 'white', 'as', 'often', 'gray.Film', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'extras', 'deluxe', 'set', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'extremely', 'affordable', 'prices', 'magnificent', 'treatment']",N/A
105932,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,0790736918,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 17]","Films, like artists or authors, tend to have their critical reputations wax and wane through a few cycles until a consensus is finally reached. Of course, consensus has little to do with real world excellence or failure, but as good an example of this trend as can be shown certainly is John Ford's famed 1956 John Wayne Western, The Searchers. Upon its initial release, the film made a solid profit, and was considered a good film. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, film school graduates started championing both it and Ford as more than good, but great. By the 1980s, with the rise of PC, the film's political content and its portrayal of Manifest Destiny came under attack as `racist,' and the film was not held in as high regard for some years. With the advent of DVD technology, in the late 1990s, the film was re-released, and its current status as a `masterpiece' has been little challenged since. Indeed, in watching the special features on the two disk Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD of the film, one might believe that the film is Shakespearean. Assorted talking heads and film buffs gush over the film; even people like director Martin Scorsese. Another great director, Akira Kurosawa, is cited as declaring he learned film technique from watching John Ford Westerns.Of course, I do not doubt all of these people's love for the film, but love (or like/hate) is a wholly different paradigm from artistic excellence. And while there is no doubt that, technically, John Ford was a superb craftsman- in the framing of shots, in the use of silences that he carried over from his silent film days, in the judicious use of close-ups, and the brilliant use of color in this VistaVision film, it is nowhere near a great work of art. Technique and technical excellence do not equate with greatness. Were that true a poet with a merely flawless ear, like Walter de la Mare, would be ranked along with the Whitmans and Baudelaires. No, there needs to be characterization and great acting. This is where screenwriting and casting come in. The film's actual screenplay is simplistic, larded with stereotypes, and the acting- save for a few scenes where Jeffrey Hunter (as mixed breed Martin Pawley) shines, is self-conscious, poseur, and given that the film is as triumphalist as can be, it makes such preening seem hedonistic.Naturally, the worst sinner, on this accord, is John Wayne, as the film's putative hero/anti-hero, Ethan Edwards. There is no doubt Wayne had a great onscreen presence- both physically and in his idiosyncratic emoting and speaking styles; but while watching the film, and seeing him strut and spit out trite lines while dickwaving through every second he's on camera, I fully understand why someone like my dad- a left of center trade unionist, found both the man and the characters he played (which were really minor variations on his own faux persona, admixed with testosterone) to be symbols of everything that's wrong with America, past and present.At first, The Searchers was an undervalued film; now it's a grossly overrated one. The truth lies somewhere between the extremes- something men like John Wayne nor Ethan Edwards ever seemed to learn, no matter how many things critics want to read into a shrug, an akimbo stance, nor an oddly breathily paused clich&eacute; uttered. If John Ford ever did, it was not evident in this film, neither in wax nor Wayne.",3,Mediocre,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,3402,"['Films', 'artists', 'authors', 'tend', 'have', 'critical', 'reputations', 'wax', 'wane', 'few', 'cycles', 'consensus', 'finally', 'reached', 'course', 'consensus', 'little', 'do', 'real', 'world', 'excellence', 'failure', 'as', 'good', 'example', 'trend', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'certainly', 'John', 'Ford', 'famed', '1956', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Western', 'Searchers', 'initial', 'release', 'film', 'made', 'solid', 'profit', 'was', 'considered', 'good', 'film', 'late', '1960s', 'early', '1970s', 'however', 'film', 'school', 'graduates', 'started', 'championing', 'Ford', 'more', 'good', 'great', '1980s', 'rise', 'PC', 'film', 'political', 'content', 'portrayal', 'Manifest', 'Destiny', 'came', 'attack', 'racist', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'held', 'as', 'high', 'regard', 'years', 'advent', 'DVD', 'technology', 'late', '1990s', 'film', 'was', 're-released', 'current', 'status', 'masterpiece', 'been', 'little', 'challenged', 'Indeed', 'watching', 'special', 'features', 'two', 'disk', 'Ultimate', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'film', 'one', 'might', 'believe', 'film', 'Shakespearean', 'Assorted', 'talking', 'heads', 'film', 'buffs', 'gush', 'film', 'even', 'people', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'great', 'director', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'cited', 'declaring', 'learned', 'film', 'technique', 'watching', 'John', 'Ford', 'Westerns.Of', 'course', 'do', 'not', 'doubt', 'people', 'love', 'film', 'love', 'like/hate', 'wholly', 'different', 'paradigm', 'artistic', 'excellence', 'doubt', 'technically', 'John', 'Ford', 'was', 'superb', 'craftsman-', 'framing', 'shots', 'use', 'silences', 'carried', 'silent', 'film', 'days', 'judicious', 'use', 'close-ups', 'brilliant', 'use', 'color', 'VistaVision', 'film', 'nowhere', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'Technique', 'technical', 'excellence', 'do', 'not', 'equate', 'greatness', 'Were', 'true', 'poet', 'merely', 'flawless', 'ear', 'Walter', 'de', 'la', 'Mare', 'would', 'be', 'ranked', 'Whitmans', 'Baudelaires', 'No', 'be', 'characterization', 'great', 'acting', 'where', 'screenwriting', 'casting', 'come', 'film', 'actual', 'screenplay', 'simplistic', 'larded', 'stereotypes', 'acting-', 'save', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'mixed', 'breed', 'Martin', 'Pawley', 'shines', 'self-conscious', 'poseur', 'given', 'film', 'as', 'triumphalist', 'can', 'be', 'such', 'preening', 'seem', 'hedonistic.Naturally', 'worst', 'sinner', 'accord', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film', 'putative', 'hero/anti-hero', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'doubt', 'Wayne', 'had', 'great', 'onscreen', 'presence-', 'physically', 'idiosyncratic', 'emoting', 'speaking', 'styles', 'watching', 'film', 'seeing', 'strut', 'out', 'trite', 'lines', 'dickwaving', 'second', 'camera', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'dad-', 'left', 'center', 'trade', 'unionist', 'found', 'man', 'characters', 'played', 'were', 'really', 'minor', 'variations', 'own', 'faux', 'persona', 'admixed', 'testosterone', 'be', 'symbols', 'everything', 'wrong', 'America', 'past', 'present.At', 'first', 'Searchers', 'was', 'undervalued', 'film', 'now', 'grossly', 'overrated', 'one', 'truth', 'somewhere', 'extremes-', 'something', 'men', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'ever', 'seemed', 'learn', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'things', 'critics', 'want', 'read', 'shrug', 'akimbo', 'stance', 'oddly', 'breathily', 'paused', 'clich', 'eacute', 'uttered', 'John', 'Ford', 'ever', 'did', 'was', 'not', 'evident', 'film', 'wax', 'Wayne']",N/A

If you are a true fan of the pre-1960's western film style, especially with John Wayne and his typical band of old horse opera cronies [Ward Bond, Patrick Wayne, Ken Curtis & Harry Carey Jr.] then you may really like it. Unfortunately I still found the opening vistas of Monument Valley to be the most exciting part of this movie. The combination of too many sappy/cheesy moments, such as the wedding fight scene between Jeffrey Hunter and Ken Curtis, and actual native Americans only being used in minor, uncredited supporting roles, hurt this movie badly. They took The Searchers way off point, cost the movie its credibility, and seriously reminded me of F-Troop. I really wanted to like The Searchers, and I have tried watching it several times, but each time it peters out about 1/4 of the way into the story and I just can't finish viewing it in one continuous sitting.

Divorce it from the genre it ranks as one of cinema's greatest achievement.  Director John Ford advanced the genre with ""Stagecoach"" and the calvary trilogy but he raises the stakes even further here.  The title of the film has multiple meanings.  On the surface it refers to the 5 year trek to find young Debbie who was taken by the Comanche after the slaughter of her family.  It could also refer to John Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards, a man who served in the Confederacy during the Civil War who wandered for three years before returning to his family.  His search for young Debbie raises questions.  Does Debbie represent family to him or is she now part of the hated Comanche?  One of the chillier images I have from the film is Edwards nonchalantly shooting out the eyes of a dead Comanche.  The motivation for this is Edwards' knowledge that the Comanche believes he'll wander in the afterlife blindly without his eyes.  Wayne's performance of this complex character is subtle yet towering.  Jeffrey Hunter more than holds his own as Martin Pauley, Debbie's adopted brother who forms an uneasy alliance with Edwards to find her.  There's nothing showy about Hunter's work here but it's no less impressive than his young method actor contemporaries(Brando, Dean, etc.).  Great supporting cast on hand(Ward Bond, Vera Miles, etc.).  Vivid storytelling and Ford has never utilized his beloved Monument Valley to better effect.

C. Gwynne which is the story of ""Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History.""My wife read some of the more dramatic sections of the book to me and I was impressed by the barbaric cruelty of the Comanches and their remarkable skill as warriors; their ability on horseback was unparalleled. Having this book in my mind as I watched the movie only emphasized the romanticized version of the old West that Hollywood was creating during the 50's.It was so evident that much of the so-called Texas scenery was all filmed in Utah's Monument Valley with absolutely no concern for accuracy. The appearance of the indians and the other characters was also much romanticized in the movie in typical Hollywood fashion.If you want to watch the movie as a sample of John Wayne's acting then that is one thing; if you're hoping for an accurate glimpse into life in the old West during that time in history then forget it; any similarity is purely coincidental.",3,Classic 1950's Western Movie,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,1481,"['movie', 'received', 'lot', 'belated', 'praise', 'many', 'sources', 'say', 'belated', 'because', 'praise', 'was', 'slow', 'coming', 'film', 'won', 'academy', 'awards', 'time', 'release', 'fans', 'John', 'Wayne', 'probably', 'must', 'see', 'many', 'commentators', 'say', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'John', 'Wayne', 'best', 'performance.We', 'watched', 'movie', 'wife', 'been', 'reading', 'intensely', 'dramatic', 'graphic', 'book', 'called', 'Empire', 'Summer', 'Moon', 'S.', 'C.', 'Gwynne', 'story', 'Quanah', 'Parker', 'Rise', 'Fall', 'Comanches', 'Most', 'Powerful', 'Indian', 'Tribe', 'American', 'History', 'wife', 'read', 'more', 'dramatic', 'sections', 'book', 'was', 'impressed', 'barbaric', 'cruelty', 'Comanches', 'remarkable', 'skill', 'warriors', 'ability', 'horseback', 'was', 'unparalleled', 'Having', 'book', 'mind', 'watched', 'movie', 'only', 'emphasized', 'romanticized', 'version', 'old', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'creating', ""50's.It"", 'was', 'so', 'evident', 'much', 'so-called', 'Texas', 'scenery', 'was', 'filmed', 'Utah', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'absolutely', 'concern', 'accuracy', 'appearance', 'indians', 'other', 'characters', 'was', 'also', 'much', 'romanticized', 'movie', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fashion.If', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'sample', 'John', 'Wayne', 'acting', 'then', 'one', 'thing', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'accurate', 'glimpse', 'life', 'old', 'West', 'time', 'history', 'then', 'forget', 'similarity', 'purely', 'coincidental']",N/A

I've since merely brushed it aside as another one of those westerns about a cowboy who seems to have walked right out of a dry cleaners manages to shoot down hundreds of hooting Indians who charge at him recklessly, while never needing to reload. Until finally curiosity finally pushed me to watch it again. So I ordered it and watched it a few times.Not being much of a John Wayne fanatic, he certainly had a very strong screen presence. He played as Ethan, and ex-Confederate soldier who returns back to his brother's family as the American Civil War winds down. After his brother's family is massacred in a Comanche raid he goes off to find his niece whom is believed to have survived the attack. His character headstrong, never actually surrendering to the Union, and a bigot as well, given his attitude towards Indians including his mixed blood ride-along. His nature nearly gets the best of him as well in a climatic and very tense part of the movie.While the movie does feel generic, I guess that is only because of the massive influence it has had on other movies that either took inspiration or ripped it off all together. Overall a great movie, and definitely an important one not just to Westerns but in cinema history as well.On a side note, while many may find the portrayal of Indians in the Searchers unsavory. I find them amusing. Being a Navajo I've long heard about how Navajos were used extensively as extras in numerous Western movies including this one.

Even the &quot;politically sensitive&quot; and &quot;revisionist&quot;  reviewers are compelled to do handsprings (usually _ad hominem_ attacks on  Wayne)to try make their agenda in the face of this epic work.Central to  this film is the brilliant performance of John Wayne as the tormented  anti-hero Ethan Edwards.  His cynical, hard-bitten character embodies the  full range of racial hatred for the Commanche and dread at the sexual  violation and torture of white women captives that one can find in the  chronicles of early Texas.  Sorry revisionists!  This is the way it  _was_._The Searchers_ is one of the first films that takes up this  subject, and it acknowledges the Victorian view that once defiled a white  woman would not be accepted back into society.  Watch the scene with  Edward's reaction to the female captives brought in by the Seventh Cavalry.  That Edwards barely resolves the question of survival in favor of his  niece is a function only of that most human side of his character-- his  devotion even beyond the grave to the girl's mother whom he loved, but who  married Edward's brother.John Ford's trademark humor barely relieves  what is one of his darkest films.  The much written about conclusion is one  of the iconographic moments of the American Western.With outstanding  cinematography, a rousing soundtrack, and wonderful characterizations (see  Ward Bond as the Preacher and Ranger Captain), this is a great film.

John Wayne, I believe, portrayed one of his first anti-heroes ever (the other being ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"", another Ford classic) and he even named one of his sons after his character.  I've seen this classic on HD Net Movies and the transfer was fantastic--it's as if the movie was made yesterday and not in 1956!! Of course, too accolades from renowned directors such as Akira Kurosawa, David Lean (he resaw this film several times while making ""Lawrence of Arabia""), Martin Scorsese, George Lucas (Star Wars owes quite a bit to this), Orson Welles and Curtis Hanson have helped to push this film into the American Film Institute of all time great Westerns. I guess one flaw I had wished Ford would've removed from this classic is the cornball humor involving Vera Miles, Jeffrey Hunter and an actor who's appeared in later ""Gunsmoke"" as episodes by the name of Curtis!!  Anyway outside of this quibble, the virtues of this film outweigh its flaws, Wayne himself turns in perhaps his greatest performance here.

Zabriskie ""zabdart""","[7, 8]","Over half a century since its first release, ""The Searchers"" remains a landmark of American cinema, perhaps the greatest Western ever made, and the one against which all others must be measured.  John Ford, who more or less defined the conventions of this genre with films like ""Stagecoach,"" ""My Darling Clementine,"" and ""Fort Apache,"" never made a better, more complex Western than this one, and he may never have made a better film -- an extraordinary claim, when you consider that Ford gave us such classics as ""The Grapes of Wrath"" and ""How Green Was My Valley.""""The Searchers"" operates on so many levels at once, it takes nearly a dozen separate viewings to begin to appreciate them all.  Even then, you can always find something new in this film every time you view it.  It's extraordinary.This film demands to be viewed in the widescreen format, so just ignore the ""full-screen"" edition.  It's a waste of time.  Ford never shot his Monument Valley locations as lovingly, as achingly, or as heartbreakingly as he does here, and that's part of the point.  If you consider the landscape not as backdrop or scenery, but as a separate character in its own right, whole new levels of meaning and thematic development begin to reveal themselves.  The neighboring Jorgenson family then emerges not as minor characters whose function is to help the plot along, but as a sort of Greek chorus.  Their comments about ""This land..."" expressed not in sentences, but in sighs and shrugs become symbolic of the personal sacrifices necessary to the settling and ""civilizing"" of the Western wilderness.  Seen in that light, the female characters, who are less than fully developed, suddenly become the whole point of the movie.  Remember, the quest which generates the whole story is to restore the abducted Debbie to her ""rightful home,"" even though that home no longer exists.As Ethan Edwards, the main character, John Wayne gives the performance of his career.  Never before or since would Wayne portray a character as complex or conflicted as Ethan Edwards, and you can't imagine anyone else who could pull it off.  While Edwards exudes all of the ""manly virtues"" Wayne's characters are famous for: strength, toughness, the skills necessary to the task at hand, an uncompromising sense of honor, etc. with Ethan Edwards, there's a hole in that honor.  Edwards is also an uncompromising racist at heart, something which he makes clear early on and throughout the picture.  He is a character driven as much by his hatred of Indians as he is for the love of his departed family, and he must resolve this conflict by the end of the story, when his quest is finally completed.Through the internal conflicts of his characters, director Ford is able to say some very subtle things about ""the winning of the West"" and the price American civilization paid for it.  It's not all glorious.  Some of it is down-right ugly, but Ford is too subtle an artist to editorialize or let you know what he thinks about it.  Instead, through the vehicle of this single story, Ford is able to say: ""Look.  This is what happened, and this is why it happened this way,"" and let the viewer draw his own conclusions about the goodness or rightness of that.This is one extraordinary movie.  If you're serious about American cinema, Westerns, John Ford or John Wayne, it's essential.  It's essential even if you're not serious about any of that.

Sure - it is a cowboy movie that is directed by John Ford, and includes a simple story to follow. After the murder and kidnapping of a family member, the Duke and his buddy go searching for the culprits. In this case, a group of Indians led by a chief named Scar are to blame. But, the Searchers is different because John Wayne is much more intense in this role than others. Despite some slow parts in the plot, the Duke pulls off the role with vigor. Also, a few social issues are included as well.Normally I would give this movie five stars, but I simply did not enjoy it as much as some other John Wayne westerns that I have seen. While I think it is worth watching, not sure it is not quite a five-star classic. If you like Westerns, you will most likely enjoy this one.

105954,A32BEW34PPEAXJ,0790736918,dolly_,"[4, 4]","In the movie, Ethan's (John Wayne) brother's cabin is attacked by Scar and his war party, and his family is slaughtered. Ethan is an Indian hater and he gets consumed with revenge after that happens. The daughter, Debbie is still alive. Ethan sets off to rescue Debbie but as the story goes on, his motives change. He wants to kill her because she has been 'ruined' by Scar. In his mind, she has ceased to be white. Ethan is joined in his search by Martin who is there to protect Debbie from Ethan.My favorite scene is when Ethan and Martin are talking. In the distance there is a dot. Slowly, it takes human form and you can see it is Debbie. Ethan tries to kill her but is prevented by Martin. The Comanche indians come and Martin and Ethan have to run away. Martin still wants to rescue Debbie and Ethan wants to take her away from the Native Americans just to kill her. Will Ethan kill Debbie? Can Ethan overcome his racism?Some people might say that the movie is bad because 'fight scenes' seem unreal or because it sterotypes Native Americans.  True, the fight scences are a little off but many westerns were like that back in the day.  About the movie being racist, just because Edwards is a racist, doesn't mean that the movie was meant to be racist against Native Americans.  If you use that logic, Schindler's List would be anti-jewish, Amistad is anti-black, etc.  I have read that the director in the past had used actual Native Americans in his other movies but he cast a white as Scar because he wanted to make the statement that Ethan and Scar underneath it all are the same and despite our difference, we are all humans.The movie has great acting. The impression on Ethan's face when he thinks that Martha's cabin might have been attacked. It has comedy. Moes (think Dana Carvey doing his George Bush impersonation), the lovable idiot who just wants a rocking chair. Breathtaking cinematography. The final scene. The scenery. It has contradictions. Even though Ethan hates the Comanche, he knows a lot about them. He knows about their religion (by shooting out that Native American's eyes, he would roam forever in the afterlife), he can speak their language and he commits a scalping later in the movie. Laurie tells Martin that Martha would have wanted Ethan to kill Debbie for being involved with an Indian but Laurie wants to marry Martin and he is one-eighth Cherokee which I think makes him an Indian. Ethan thinks it is funny when Martin 'marries' Look but he is angry about Debbie and Scar. The story is complex. It deals with obsession, alienation, racism, hatred and forgiveness.Some people might not like this movie at first but they need to look deeper into it. Things in this movie are not spelled out. I notice new things every time I watch it. It is a western and from the 50s which might turn some people off, but you should give this movie a chance.

105956,A2ZHZ8ZTHJKOS0,0790736918,Douglas Doepke,"[4, 7]","A second look at this film is long overdue. It's been hailed by many as a masterpiece. Even the anti-Ford critic David Thomson in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film classifies it as an exceptional work. I don't know whether it's the Ford mystique, the Wayne icon, or the mesmerizing beauty of Monument Valley that holds this movie to a different standard from most Westerns. But something is at work that numbs an eye-level scrutiny. The Searchers is a good film, but no masterpiece, and certainly does not belong in the American Film Institute's list of all-time top films. A brief look at some of the more obvious defects:Ford makes picture postcards out of the soaring spires and buttes. At no point does he come to grips with the real harshness of the terrain. This is desert country. Hardly anything grows-- just scope out the sparseness of greenery. Yet we're told cattle herds feed here in large enough numbers to support families, (In the movie, Jorgensen's right--  they would be better off raising pigs than cattle). Also, there is no hint of extreme desert heat or cold affecting anything or anybody. The parties go here and there with slim regard for what the conditions actually afford. In short, the celebrated landscape amounts to little more than a majestic backdrop without a true reality of its own. Ford may love this Spartan terrain, but he gives it scant respect.Similarly, the film-maker undercuts the naturalism of the vaunted visuals. The audience gets an awesome flow of natural wonders, only to have the flow interrupted by outdoor sets so painfully obvious, they can't be ignored, (consider the Futterman ambush scene, for one). As a result, visual continuity is sacrificed and so is fidelity to the intended atmosphere. Suddenly we're jolted out of the scenic spell back into recognition that this is, after all, only a movie. Where, one wonders, was Ford's very real poetic eye in these disruptive scenes, and why didn't he insist on shooting all outdoor scenes outdoors-- especially after traveling to Colorado for the great snow scenes. As a premier film-maker, I'm sure he had the clout. Nonetheless, the lapse is another glaring defect.There's another problem with respect, this time for the adversary. In fact, the Indians do get some concessions--Scar is provided a moment of motivation and a good sarcastic aside-- but not much else. As in Ford's cavalry cycle, aboriginal peoples still exist as convenient devices and sitting ducks. From the film's several battles, it appears the Indians know nothing about  combat tactics. Stupidly, they never attack unless an escape route is left open to the fleeing settlers. And when they attack frontally across the river or in front of the cave, they mass in a bunch so the dug-in whites can hardly miss. No wonder there are so few Indians left. In most Westerns, this cliche would not even merit comment, but remember this one's supposed to be a ""masterpiece"". (For a gauge of Ford's dishonesty, compare his cardboard warriors with the skilled and savvy combatants in the similarly themed ""Ulzana's Raid"" {1973}).For what is required of the actors, contrast the first ten minutes with the movie's remainder. Those first few minutes are little short of superb. There's a low-key naturalism and subtlety that's fascinating-- Just who is Ethan Edwards? What is the tension between his brother and him? And where did he get that impressive war medal? The well-crafted impression is that of real people concealing true feelings, while groping toward some kind of reconciliation across unspoken barriers. Then Ward Bond and the posse arrive and slam-bang stereotypes take over. The promising beginning is lost, while Ford reverts to form by replacing character with caricature. Bond, for example, is not just a gruff old man, but  The Gruff Old Man; Jeffrey Hunter is not just a callow youth, but The Callow Youth; and most egregiously, Ken Curtis is not one more country yokel, but The Rub-your-Nose-In-It Country Yokel. Moreover, conversation ceases, hat-throwing and bellowing take over, and genuine interaction gives way to exaggerated personalities doing little more than bouncing off one another. Even Wayne's one-note avenger comes close to parody, (unlike others, however, he is never mocked). Of course, such caricatures provide ample grist for Ford's broad idea of humor. Nonetheless, the comic set-ups come perilously close at times to a Three Stooges level, particularly the scenes with Old Mose, and with Bond and Patrick Wayne. I'm not against comic relief, but I am when it flirts with burlesque in an otherwise serious film.More could be pointed out, such as the distracting subplots, or the ludicrous wedding sequence, or most glaringly, the climax with its sudden, unmotivated change of heart-- after all, it's the racial conflict that drives the plot. I guess what really bothers me is how blithely Ford substitutes his own highly simplistic vision of the Old West for any really plausible version. There's a basic lack of respect for the material, which allows, for example, such facile touches as Jorgensen's unweathered two-story wooden house in the middle of the desert, or Vera Miles' brocaded form-fitting wedding gown that appears to have been flown in from Paris. My point is not that the film lacks merit-- the justly celebrated doorway shots, for example. Rather, it's one of perspective--  this is an entertaining film but far from a masterpiece.The Searchers may be lauded and popular with many. Nonetheless, beneath the glossy surface lies an under-developed theme that really deserved better than standard stock company treatment. In short, Thomson is wrong. The Searchers is not an exception to Ford's usual product. Rather, it's just a little less compromised.",4,A Critical Second Look,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,5773,"['second', 'look', 'film', 'long', 'overdue', 'been', 'hailed', 'many', 'masterpiece',

105957,ADS5APY1NKTL4,0790736918,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[3, 6]","I was introduced to this, one of John Wayne's most well known films, in an American Indian Cinema course.  We viewed it as an example of the depiction of Native Americans in 1950s cinema.  Of course, I probably don't need to even bother mentioning that the Native people featured in this film are on the ""villain's team.""  Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) is searching for Debbie (Natalie Wood) a White girl kidnapped by the Comanches and is married to Scar (Henry Brandon).  She has totally been immersed in the Comanche culture and has lost touch with the customs of her biological family.  Ethan is traveling with Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), a young man of mixed Native and White ancestry.  There is also an ambiguity about the true nature of the men's relationship.  Are they related or just out to reunite Debbie with her family?There is no doubt that this film is a visual masterpiece.  Directors like Martin Scorsese consider this film a model for their filmmaking, with good reason.  You can't go wrong with sweeping landscapes and scenic shots of dry plains.  The acting is, at times, quite cardboard (to be diplomatic) and John Wayne is the epitome of the anti-hero loner who is led to do good for people for an unseen reason.  Also, that walk of his (a sort of hip swiveling swagger) is something you just have to see to believe.  No one has really been able to replicate John Wayne's moves, to this day (at least, not in my opinion).  The view of Native Americans in this story is stereotypical and negative (not unusual for John Ford westerns or John Wayne vehicles).  Yet, the role of Scar is a direct parallel to the role of Ethan, and their similarities transcend their differences in a caricaturish way.  I can almost guarantee that anyone who takes issue with the bad depiction of Native Americans in cinema will be offended by several of the scenes (one of which involving a Comanche bride that is ""traded"" off to John Wayne--I want elaborate on it here.).  Nevertheless, it is a film worth a view (or two), because it is well known for a good reason.

Over the course of years, a rich tapestry of characters and events unfold, as the nature of the pair's motives are revealed, and bigoted, bitter Edwards emerges as a twisted man bent on killing the 'tainted' white girl.

John Wayne plays a flawed centerpiece, a grizzled former soldier with a chip on his shoulder and a strange, conflicted relationship with his extended family. As usual, cool confidence and raw masculinity seep from his pores and he takes hold of each scene with a pair of strong, old cowherder's hands. This is a film that rewards an active imagination, as there's much going on between the lines that, without being spelled out, brands the cast with an unusual level of depth and detail. Unspoken histories flesh out most every character, allowing even generic walk-ons to mosey into the picture at most any moment and cast ripples throughout the entire tapestry. It can be slow at times, and the casting of a very obviously non-native actor to lead the stereotypical enemy Comanche tribe doesn't sit well, but both such faults can be generally chalked up to the dated eccentricities of that era.

What I may be able to add is before this was available I recorded it off cable TV and pulled it out often to watch.  It is a great shame that this movie was not taken seriously when it first came out; the Duke rarely gave such an intense performance as he does here.  But Westerns were a dime a dozen and dismissed as kiddie fare despite the advent of the first ""adult"" Western ""High Noon"" 4 years earlier.  The photography is fantasatic, the performances are first rate and the dialogue, well, is mostly good.  Vera Miles (also in Wayne's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"") plays the spinster patiently waiting for Ethan Edwards (Wayne) and her awkward-in-love beau (Jeffrey Hunter) to return from the search for the kidnapped girl while Ken Curtis (""Festus"" of TV's ""Gunsmoke"" and former member of Sons of the Pioneers) romances her with his guitar.  Panhandle Pete Perkins, a Western veteran, is a dotty oldtimer.  Wayne perennial Ward Bond is on hand as a preacher and lawman/military man whose ""authority"" does not impress Wayne's character.  Patrick (Dad--got-me-the-job) Wayne turns in a good performance as a green cavalry man.  Harry Carey, Jr. is on hand in the search until a fit of rage drives him into the gunfire of the outlaw Indians.  Wayne pays tribute to Carey's father, a cowboy star in Hollywood's early days, in the end by resting his elbow in his hand (a Carey, Sr. trademark gesture) before turning his back on the warm family scene that he has made possible but is somehow foreign to him and wanders rather aimlessly away.  Oscar worthy.  You can get this flick in a set with other great Wayne movies if you like, but don't miss having THIS one.

105967,ARNEUO7BF3J55,0790736918,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","In 2008 AFI ranked The Searchers as the greatest Western of all time and generally ranks high in most top ten lists of westerns and often high in lists of greatest movies across all genre&#8217;s. Having watched it I would never dispute that it is an excellent film but I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m as bowled over as many others. The movie opens in Monument Valley in 1868 although it&#8217;s supposed to be Texas. Ethan Edwards, played by John Wayne, is just now returning from the civil war still dressed in his confederate uniform. He&#8217;s come to visit his brother Aaron and Aaron&#8217;s family including his wife, son and two daughters Lucy and Debbie. Living with the Edwards is Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), a suggested 1/8th Cherokee, whom Ethan had rescued years earlier after his family had been killed. Star Trek fans will recognize Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Pike from the Star Trek pilot. Later, a posse, along with Ethan and Martin are lured away from the Edwards house by Comanche cattle rustlers and in their absence the Comanche kill Aaron, his wife and son and kidnap the two young girls. This is the beginning of the search for Lucy and Debbie.There are a lot of mysteries in the movie that aren&#8217;t explicitly solved. Where was John Wayne during the three years between the end of the civil war and and when he arrived at the Edwards house? Where did he have a large cache of &#8220;Yankee&#8221; gold coins? Ethan himself suggests he may be wanted for a crime. The big question is why does Ethan seem to have such an animosity towards Martin giving him an angry glare from the moment he enters the movie.For me, what keeps the movie from receiving my highest praise are some of the stylistic choices common in the 1950&#8217;s. There is some great acting but there is also a lot of overacting as when Lucy discovers their house in under siege and gives the classic knuckles to the mouth horror movie scream. After the murder of the Edwards, Martin tries to go back in the house where his adopted mother&#8217;s body is and Ethan punches him out to keep him from seeing the carnage. That happens in old movies but not in real life. There is also some unfortunate racism. The Native American&#8217;s are the villains of the story which is common in the 1950&#8217;s but it&#8217;s the ineptitude of the Comanche that bothered me. In an incredibly tense scene the original seven searchers are menaced by a much larger group of Comanche who slowly flank the group on either side. The Searchers take off on horseback pursued closely and yet somehow are magically able to pick off a handful of Comanche despite riding in full gallop with their backs to their pursuers. They probably kill a dozen or so while only having one of their group wounded in the fire fight. Later in the film, thanks to some miscommunication, Martin finds himself with an Indian bride. Out on the trail Martin is trying to go to sleep when the woman lies down next to him and in a shockingly ugly scene Martin boots her full force down a hill.There are some sympathetic moments towards the native American&#8217;s particularly when U.S. soldiers attack a camp and kill many of the residents but their ineptitude is disturbing. Even when Ethan and Martin are trapped at the mouth of a cave by over a dozen Indian warriors they escape unscathed even as the take down many of the warriors. These situations are simply a product of the time when this movie was made but they are enough that I cannot rate this film as the greatest western ever. It was also funny that the search lasted somewhere between five and seven years and yet Martin never ages.The highpoint of the film is the relationship between Ethan and Martin. Although it&#8217;s never explicitly spelled out why Ethan expresses such anger towards Martin it may be the Martin, being now an adult, reminds Ethan that he is aging. At one point he tells Martin not to call him grandpa or Methuselah despite Martin having never brought up his age. It&#8217;s also possible that Ethan has developed a dislike for Native American&#8217;s and Martin&#8217;s Cherokee blood may cause him to distrust. Either way they have a very complicated relationship that only gets more complicated as the film goes on and in the end Martin is all Ethan has. The other highlight of the movie are some of the most beautiful panoramic scenes in the history of movies. This is a magnificent looking movie and to get it in HD is tremendous. You really could just watch the movie for the visuals.The people who rate The Searchers as the greatest western of all time may be ignoring some of the weaknesses based on the era it came from. In my opinion the Coen brothers version of True Grit was a superior film but cinema has come a long way in 50 years. If you are a fan of Western movies this is one you really should have in your collection regardless of whether it&#8217;s subjectively the greatest or not.",5,John Wayne Puts in a Towering

There is a deleted scene where Ethan goes up a pass  through some rocks to follow one of the indians. While the others continue  around and meet him on the other side. The movie cuts to Ethan coming out  of the pass wiping his knife in the dirt and out of breath. He's asked  where's his jacket. Ethan's response is &quot;Never ask me about it&quot;.

105969,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0790736918,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","There is so much that is impressive in director John Ford's masterful 1956 classic that it is easy to get preoccupied with its glaring flaws. However, it's most important to recognize this film as a cinematic elegy of the old-fashioned western, a last-stand monument to Ford's unique oeuvre in movies before the revisionist filmmakers reshaped this type of film to meet contemporary tastes. Yet for its patently old-fashioned premise, the film contains unexpected darker tones which make the film fascinating. First, it depicts the unapologetic racism prevalent out in the frontier, and second, it has Ethan Edwards, a protagonist who not only shares these feelings but somehow redeems himself through his fortitude and often violent acts of self-defense. Through a vivid use of darkened doorways as a framing device, Ford and star John Wayne dexterously manage to elicit sympathy for the unsympathetic Edwards while maintaining his dying-breed status as a renegade outsider.Set in Texas a few years after the Civil War, the story focuses on Edwards' five-year long search for what remains of his family after a massacre by a band of Comanches headed by a chief named Scar. It becomes clear that youngest daughter Debbie may be alive, so Edwards and young tag-along, Martin Pawley, set off to find her. The motivations of the two couldn't be more different - Edwards was in love with Debbie's now-dead mother and seeks vengeance, which includes killing Debbie for being a converted Comanche; while Pawley wants to save Debbie and bring her back home. Frank S. Nugent's screenplay masterfully peels the layers off their journey with a series of revelations that lead to the dramatic final act. This is likely Wayne's finest two hours on film not because he plays his archetypal cowboy hero but because he shows a surprising audacity in exposing the dark soul of his character while slowly recognizing a begrudging humanism through his discoveries in the film.Everybody else is merely serviceable in comparison, including Jeffrey Hunter, who darts unsteadily between youthful arrogance and childish petulance as Pawley; Ward Bond as a bellowing reverend and Texas ranger; and a teenaged Natalie Wood, who has scant screen time late in the film as the grown Debbie. Vera Miles fares somewhat better as the headstrong Laurie, the girl Pawley leaves behind, though I find their romantic subplot rather distracting, especially toward the end with a lighthearted but lengthy wedding sequence. In fact, comic relief is used a little too liberally throughout the film with irritating performances from Hank Worden as the mentally defective Mose Harper and Ken Curtis as Laurie's anxious suitor Charlie. However, these are minor blemishes in the scheme of things, especially in light of Winton C. Hoch's magnificent cinematography. Never has the camera captured the beauty and drama of Monument Valley with more emotional fervor, even if it is masquerading as Texas. Special mention should also be given to Max Steiner's powerful musical score.Above all else, the film reflects the pinnacle of both Ford's and Wayne's careers, a point not lost on the elaborate two-disc 2006 DVD set. The first disc has a pristine print of the film along with a brief introduction by Wayne's son Patrick (who plays a small role in the film as a baby-faced Union soldier) and a terrifically insightful commentary track by director Peter Bogdanovich. He is not the only master director who reveres the film, as Curtis Hanson, Martin Scorsese, and John Milius offer their own praise on a new half-hour documentary on the second disc, ""The Searchers: A New Appreciation"". There are two other excellent featurettes included -  a 1998 behind-the-scenes documentary, ""A Turning of the Earth: John Ford, John Wayne and The Searchers,"" and a vintage piece hosted by Gig Young called ""Behind the Cameras"", which has interviews with Hunter and Wood and an overview of Monument Valley.

Westerns have never been my favorite, other than Roy Rogers shorts. I can usually watch them for about an hour, and then a dusty boredom starts to set in. But this film totally captivated me. The director Ford/star Wayne pairing was a famous collaboration, starting with ""Stagecoach"", another classic, in 1939. In this film, they both reach their peak. Though I grew up watching John Wayne movies, and had a kind of mildly amused understanding of his legend, I always got the impression he was just barreling his way through his roles. In this film, everything he was and represented comes together in a portrayal of steel determination, you DON'T mess with John Wayne. As the man on a mission to avenge the slaughter of his brother's family by ""The Indians"", and the search for his kidnapped little niece, his performance is totally enthralling. Jeffery Hunter, who was probably the prettiest of all the pretty boys (John Derek, Robert Wagner, Tony Curtis, etc....) that rose to stardom in the 1950's, convincingly plays the adopted part Indian nephew, who escaped the slaughter of Wayne's brother's family, and joins him on his search. Natalie Wood, though her  role is small as the grown kidnapped ""Debbie"", never the less was a fitting choice for the sympathetic portrayal, as she was the 1950's girl that everyone wanted for a daughter. The supporting cast is a ""Who's -Who"" of great character actors. The famous cinematography totally lives up to it's legend, it's desert hues are breathtaking. And, the famous final shot, which I guess everyone in the world but myself has already seen, well, I choked watching it, not only because of the visual impact of that moment, but for the realization of the irretrievable passing of this kind of film, star, director...This is a wonderful movie experience, that has AMERICAN written all over it, and totally explains the fascination with and the exalted place in movie history of ""The Duke.""",5,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This.,1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,2104,"['Unbelievably', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'embarressing', 'admission', 'someone', 'who', 'themself', 'something', 'classic', 'film', 'buff', 'Westerns', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'favorite', 'other', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'shorts', 'can', 'usually', 'watch', 'hour', 'then', 'dusty', 'boredom', 'set', 'film', 'totally', 'captivated', 'director', 'Ford/star', 'Wayne', 'pairing', 'was', 'famous', 'collaboration', 'starting', 'Stagecoach', 'classic', '1939', 'film', 'reach', 'peak', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'had', 'kind', 'mildly', 'amused', 'understanding', 'legend', 'always', 'got', 'impression', 'was', 'just', 'barreling', 'way', 'roles', 'film', 'everything', 'was', 'represented', 'together', 'portrayal', 'steel', 'determination', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'mess', 'John', 'Wayne', 'man', 'mission', 'avenge', 'slaughter', 'brother', 'family', 'Indians', 'search', 'kidnapped', 'little', 'niece', 'performance', 'totally', 'enthralling', 'Jeffery', 'Hunter', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'prettiest', 'pretty', 'boys', 'John', 'Derek', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'etc', 'rose', 'stardom', '1950', 'convincingly', 'adopted', 'part', 'Indian', 'nephew', 'who', 'escaped', 'slaughter', 'Wayne', 'brother', 'family', 'search', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'role', 'small', 'grown', 'kidnapped', 'Debbie', 'never', 'less', 'was', 'fitting', 'choice', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'was', '1950', 'girl', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'daughter', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Who', '-Who', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'famous', 'cinematography', 'totally', 'up', 'legend', 'desert', 'hues', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'famous', 'final', 'shot', 'guess', 'everyone', 'world', 'already', 'seen', 'well', 'choked', 'watching', 'not', 'only', 'visual', 'impact', 'moment', 'realization', 'irretrievable', 'passing', 'kind', 'film', 'star', 'director', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'experience', 'AMERICAN', 'written', 'totally', 'fascination', 'exalted', 'place', 'movie', 'history', 'Duke']",N/A

Warner had no alternate takes or deleted scenes to display, typical of the efficient Ford, Bogdanovich says.""The Searchers"" comes in two double-disc sets with identical content on the DVDs. The ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" adds only print materials, including reproductions of the 1956 tie-in comic and the original press book, along with some unremarkable memos and postcards.There is a good deal of repetitive material in the extras for this title and some of the other Wayne-Ford releases -- images, clips, stories -- but most viewers won't mind.

This is the epic western tale of survival in a hostile land.  John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, an outsider, who comes back to his brother's ranch several years after the Civil War.  Ethan was on the 'lost cause' side of the conflict.  As a Confederate war veteran, he tries to find his place once again in this reconstruction phase of his life...he has been lost and wandering for several years. Once back home with his brother, he starts to slowly unwind.  This conflicted character soon find himself with Marty (Jeff Hunter), and the Texas Rangers..lead by Ward Bond..chasing stolen cattle only to find themselves fooled by the Commache..(who are on a raiding party).  Upon returning to the ranch, Commaches have massacred the brother, wife and stolen Lucy and Debbie..the two daughters.  This leads to the downs and ups of them searching all over the territory for the stolen daughters.Watch this film for the cinematography as well as the fine acting by John Wayne.  As the movie opens the film starts inside the cabin home and as the door opens we are sweeped into the Monument Valley vistas.  All throughout the film, Ford used the landscape as another actor.  When the movie closes, the camera pulls back into the same cabin view, just in reverse.  With everyone going back to loved ones, the door closes leaving Ethan..much as he started...outside the door and homeless...clutching just himself.This is a great movie especially for those who want to learn more about the art and technique of movie making.

105981,AW00OHXP7JPJF,0790736918,Fort Knox,"[1, 3]","Considered by many to be the greatest western of all time, and even a contender for the greatest FILM of all time, I'm hesitant to rate this any lower than 5 Stars.  However, there are some negative aspects of this film that need to be addressed.What Works:John Wayne's monumental performance as the racist, obsessive loner Ethan Edwards. Unable to make any connections with friends or family, Ethan devotes all his energy to finding his kidnapped niece. As time passes he slightly alters his mission to ""Search and Destroy"" because he figures she's been sleeping with the Commanches.The beautiful scenery of John Ford's favorite location- Monument Valley. Absolutely breathtaking.What Doesn't Work:Some of the supporting cast (Ford's normally dependable stock company) comes off as rather annoying. Ken Curtis being the biggest offender with his comic accent.The scene which involves Martin's temporary Indian bride whom both Ethan and Martin cruelly mistreat. When Martin kicks her down the hill for a laugh will probably not fly with modern audiences. [Like me]Another scene that I can't stand is the comic wedding fight between Martin and Charlie (Ken Curtis) On the one hand; I like Ford's use of dances to symbolize community and family. Having the two wandering men come home from the wilderness to the festive celebration is a nice contrast, but the emphasis on Ken Curtis and the ensuing fight is unfortunate for a film of this caliber. Infact that whole love triangle proved to be a major distraction.-----The Searchers is certainly a masterpiece, but there are uneven bits of comic relief that drag the film down. When i watch this film I always skip these scenes with the remote, which makes for a far more satisfying experience.Also I highly recommend the Ultimate Collector's Edition. Or for a few dollars more, just buy the John Ford/John Wayne boxset which includes the Searchers, Stagecoach, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and more.",5,Seek & Destroy,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,1943,"['Considered', 'many', 'be', 'greatest', 'western', 'time', 'even', 'contender', 'greatest', 'FILM', 'time', ""'m"", 'hesitant', 'rate', 'lower', '5', 'Stars', 'However', 'are', 'negative', 'aspects', 'film', 'need', 'be', 'addressed.What', 'John', 'Wayne', 'monumental', 'performance', 'racist', 'obsessive', 'loner', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'Unable', 'make', 'connections', 'friends', 'family', 'Ethan', 'energy', 'finding', 'kidnapped', 'niece', 'time', 'slightly', 'mission', 'Search', 'Destroy', 'been', 'sleeping', 'Commanches.The', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'John', 'Ford', 'favorite', 'location-', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'Absolutely', 'breathtaking.What', ""n't"", 'Work', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Ford', 'normally', 'dependable', 'stock', 'company', 'off', 'rather', 'annoying', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'being', 'biggest', 'offender', 'comic', 'accent.The', 'scene', 'Martin', 'temporary', 'Indian', 'bride', 'whom', 'Ethan', 'Martin', 'cruelly', 'mistreat', 'When', 'Martin', 'down', 'hill', 'laugh', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'fly', 'modern', 'audiences', '[', ']', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'comic', 'wedding', 'fight', 'Martin', 'Charlie', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'one', 'hand', 'like', 'Ford', 'use', 'dances', 'symbolize', 'community', 'family', 'Having', 'two', 'wandering', 'men', 'come', 'home', 'wilderness', 'festive', 'celebration', 'nice', 'contrast', 'emphasis', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'ensuing', 'fight', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'caliber', 'Infact', 'whole', 'love', 'triangle', 'proved', 'be', 'major', 'distraction.', '-The', 'Searchers', 'certainly', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'uneven', 'bits', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'down', 'When', 'i', 'watch', 'film', 'always', 'skip', 'scenes', 'remote', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'experience.Also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Ultimate', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'few', 'dollars', 'more', 'just', 'buy', 'John', 'Ford/John', 'Wayne', 'boxset', 'Searchers', 'Stagecoach', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'more']",N/A

105983,A2A3VF06FR0C7D,0790736918,Frank Gibbons,"[10, 13]","A masterpiece. This is by far John Wayne's best performance and it was sheer ignorance on the part of the Academy Awards that Wayne wasn't  nominated for best actor.  Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards, is one of the  most interesting characters in the history of film. Returning to his  brother's homestead three years after the Civil War, Ethan is a mysterious,  suspicious man whose motives for coming home are unclear.  Where did he get  that newly minted Yankee money? And why did he take off before the war  anyhow?  Ethan and his sister-in-law, Martha, evidently had something going  on before the war and she obviously still adores Ethan in a very chaste  way. I find the scene where Martha gives Ethan his cape one of the most  touching on film. Ward Bond's character witnesses this exchange between  Martha and Ethan and sensitively looks away.  Did he know of their love in  the past?  After the two girls are kidnapped by the Commanches, Ethan  sets out to rescue them. Over time, he realizes that the surviving girl is  by now living with 'a buck'. Ethan's new quest is to kill his niece.  Astute critics have pointed out that Ethan's miscegenation is the driving  force behind his obsessive search.  The Searchers is referenced in two of  Martin Scorcese's films.  It is one of Stephen Spielberg's favorite movies.  The French director Jean Luc Goddard says that he weeps when Ethan lifts  Debbie up near the end.  A beautiful, profound film that simply goes over  the heads of some people who refuse to believe that a Western can be great  cinema.

105985,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,0790736918,Frederick Baptist,"[5, 5]","This is a very enjoyable Western because it has the essential elements of great leading man, John Wayne, and great genre director, John Ford.  Jeffery Hunter was also very good here although my all-time favourite role of his comes much later and just before his untimely death as Capt. Christopher Pike of the Starship Enterprise.  I have always thought that of all the captains of the Enterprise, although his tenure was the briefest, he was the best actor of the lot.This film though has one of the most breathtaking scenery ever and makes full use of the colour medium to produce optimal results.  Monument Valley was an inspired locale to shoot this film and although the screenplay isn't the best with some awkward moments especially in the clumsy attempts at interjecting humour at various points that just didn't quite take, this is more than made up for with great camera work and great acting.  John Wayne is very convincing as a bigoted and racist bitter Confederate soldier who takes surrender and losing very hard who over the course of the film learns from Jeffery Hunter and his own observations to change his world view and becomes compassionate and less bigoted in the end.Overall, this is still although not a perfect picture a very, very good representative of the Western genre and like a true classic bears up well to repeated viewing.The only problem is with this version of the DVD which is very shabbily put together and is very poor.  The picture quality is terrible having not been restored and white spots and other imperfections abound on both sides i.e. Standard and pseudo-Widescreen versions although the few short documentaries on the bonus features were okay.  The only redeeming factor which warrants 2 stars is the excellent sound quality that comes in Dolby Digital and is clear and at a nice consistent volume level throughout.  Certainly one of the best dvds of an older film sound quality wise that I've seen.I notice that a Blu-ray version of this film has been released and as I haven't seen it, I hope that that version would have addressed the issues I brought up above.

105986,AU10YGO10MUCA,0790736918,Gary Lee,"[2, 3]","*Spoiler alert* THE SEARCHERS ranks seventh on the list by Sight and Sound, the prestigious British Film Institute journal, of the all-time greatest films.  The Writer's Guild of America includes it on its list of the 101 Greatest Screenplays.  The exceedingly fine first half hour justifies the accolades.  The middle section is lighter in tone and enjoyable.  The final stretch is somewhat spoiled by inconsistency in the main character.  I won't say it doesn't deserve its reputation as a classic, but with qualification.The film opens with a gorgeous interior shot as a woman, seen in silhouette, opens the front door of her frontier cabin to a breathtaking view of Monument Valley.  The film consistently rewards the viewer with its visual magnificence.  (The story takes place in Texas, whereas Monument Valley is in Arizona, but only a purist would object to that inaccuracy, given the splendor of the scenery that cinematographer Winton Hoch serves up.)  The year is 1868 and the woman is Martha Edwards, opening the door to welcome her brother-in-law Ethan Edwards (John Wayne), a Confederate veteran who is returning to his brother's homestead.  Ethan has secrets.  Where has he been in the three years since the Civil War ended, his family asks, and how did he get those sacks of Yankee gold coins that have not been circulated?  He never answers.  Perhaps the Union cavalry pants he wears are a clue.  Was he a collaborator?  A thief?  We never know.We also become aware, through subtle gestures, of the unspoken passion between Ethan and Martha.  Were they lovers before Ethan went off to the war?  Did she marry his brother in hopes of staying connected to him?  We never find out.Ethan greets the children and seems to have a special affection for the littlest one, Debbie (played by Lana Wood.  Lana's older sister, Natalie Wood, will appear later in the picture playing Debbie as a teenager--a nice casting touch).  But the sunny atmosphere grows ominous when the family's adopted son, Martin Pawley (an agile Jeffrey Hunter), arrives for dinner.  Ethan pegs him as a half-breed.  Martin tries to deflect Ethan's hostility by explaining he is one eighth Cherokee, and, ahem, please pass the biscuits.  The tension is palpable at the table as the disapproving Ethan glares at Martin.  We never find out why Ethan hates Indians, either.A Comanche chieftain (played by a white actor--here the casting doesn't work) lures Ethan away, kills the family and abducts Debbie.  The raid is heart-rending and filmed with an economy that makes it as scary as a scene out of Hitchcock.  As the family's growing fear is simply conveyed in the way they handle a lamp at dusk, we share their terrified imaginings of what is coming.Ethan sets off to find Debbie.  But there's a twist.  Martin rides with Ethan as an unwelcome deputy.  As other members of the posse disburse, we are left to wonder how these two, the searchers of the title, will handle being together on a long, grueling and dangerous quest.  I was expecting the middle of the film to be a suspenseful cross-country hunt, something like the highly underrated 1968 Western thriller, THE STALKING MOON. While there are some of those elements, the film took a more humorous turn.  Ethan and Martin encounter picaresque Western characters and droll escapades such Martin's accidental acquisition of an Indian wife, the frustration of Martin's sweetheart Laurie (a spirited performance by Vera Miles) over his refusal to settle down, and Martin's fight with Laurie's annoying fiance on her wedding day when she finally determines to marry someone else.What emerges as the heart of THE SEARCHERS is not only the mission to find the missing niece, but the unlikely bond that develops, despite themselves, between hardened tough guy Ethan and tenderfoot Martin, a connection which is deeper than either realizes or could ever bring himself to admit.While the love between Ethan and Martha is muted at the beginning, it seems powerful.  Yet screenwriter Frank Nugent never refers to it again in Ethan's motivations.  I found it curious how Ethan never indicates any desire for revenge for the killing of Martha, or that her murder further inflames his hatred for Indians.  It might make his racism at least more understandable, and create more sympathy for his character.Word arrives at the wedding that the chief who abducted Debbie has been spotted.  Debbie is now old enough to have been despoiled by her captors.  Martin worries that Ethan might kill her, believing she'd be better off dead than a chieftain's wife.The ambiguity in Ethan's character--we like him for his competence and gritty determination while recognizing the ugliness of his bigotry and violence--spills over into inconsistency when he at last comes face to face with Debbie.  At their first encounter, he does threaten to kill her, but is deflected from doing so first by Martin and then by the arrival of men from her tribe who start shooting.  Later, when the settlers prepare to invade the Comanche camp, Ethan hopes the Comanches will kill her.  During the fight, Ethan again confronts Debbie.  She flees from him in fear, only to have him catch her, lift her in his arms, and tenderly tell her they're going home.  Huh?Was he thinking of Martha at that moment?  Martha makes an anguished gesture toward Debbie at the beginning of the film as she sends Debbie away to hide from the marauding Comanches.  Certainly, it would have meant everything to Martha to know that her daughter was spared and that Ethan rescued her.  Or would it?  Others have said Martha would prefer her daughter dead than a Comanche bride.Ethan remains an enigma.  More insight into his emotions would have made him more consistent and easier to identify with.  Martin, part Cherokee, tries to protect Debbie from the savage attitudes of the whites, and ironically comes across as the most admirable one in the picture.  Today's viewer likely finds it harder to relate to Wayne's racist character as a hero.  But even if we accept the movie on its own terms in the context of its respective times--the mid-1800's frontier as depicted in the sensibilities of 1950's Hollywood--Wayne's character development still seems lacking since we get so little information about what makes him tick.  I suspect THE SEARCHERS would not be nearly as well-regarded today had a less popular Western star, say George O'Brien or Randolph Scott, played Ethan.  The on-screen associations we have with Wayne as the ultimate Western action star make up for a lot of the deficiency in the delineation of the character.Ford's classic themes are found in the film:  the importance of home, the loss of innocence in growing older, the hardship, courage--and injustice--that was required to settle the rugged land that was wrested from the natives.  But the story turns on the character of Ethan, and we need to know more about him.Thus I can't share the opinion that the screenplay is one of the greats, but THE SEARCHERS is engaging, complex, thoughtful, well-acted, and superbly shot with the assurance of a master filmmaker.  It contains generous amounts of the poetry and comedy for which Ford is famous.  The Ford-Wayne partnership is one of the most remarkable in movie history.  John Wayne considered this film his favorite of the 28--count `em, twenty-eight--pictures he and John Ford made together. For that reason alone THE SEARCHERS is a must-see.",4,The Pinnacle of the Wayne-Ford Alliance,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,7443,"['*Spoiler', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'seventh', 'list', 'Sight', 'Sound',

105989,A141BJ917VONHB,0790736918,Gerald Hartman,"[5, 7]","The Searchers: Ultimate EditionFor most John Wayne fans this is the one JW movie that is the best and hands down there favorite.  So lets review the Ultimate Editon DVD.First the Packaging:It's a very nice looking box brown carboard kinda looks like leather. Personally for 29.99 it should be in real leather or at least a better binding. No to say its not nice but its cardboard and I personally don't care for card board cases I rather have the plastic ones they tend to hold up better. Inside you will find 2 discs  and some extras.Disc 1:The movie one of the best westerns ever filmed finally gets a great transfer and looks the best I have ever seen it owning the original dvd release you will be happy to know its not a flip disc and is presented in widescreen the way it should be seen the it was shot. The story is around the search for a woman kidnapped by native Americans on the plains and Wayne plays one of the darkest and most deep characters in cinema history. You want to hate him, then u pity him, and u end up just feeling sad that you know there no place for him in the time the movie is set. The way ford shot the violence without showing a thing makes for a haunting picture, a movie you won't soon forget.The Sound is stunning for a movie of its age they did a remarkle 5.1 mix its crisp clear and makes for the total packageThere is also a Commentary by Peter Bogdanovich that for the most part seems irrelevant mainly cause only john ford and john wayne would do for this though he is kinda interesting at time but you won't listen twice.Disc2:The ExtrasThe Searchers An Appreciation:This Featurette explores the movie and how actors and others feel about this movie and its location the duke and location interesting but again you won't watch it twice.A Turning of the Earth John Ford & John Wayne and the SearchersSome interesting info but all in all starts repeating what they said in the first one. You won't watch this one twice eitherThe Assasination of Jesse JamesFirst the movie theater now the dvd COMMERCIAL IGNORE IT.Now the other extras more stuff your don't need there to separate insert boxes with stuff in them the first one hasA comic book.Its just the movie in comic book formA book of clippingIt has all the info of the searchers from the time newspaper clipping poster ads lots of stuff  they are both small about 5 by 8.The Other BoxIt has  2 interoffice memos about the concerns over the movie nice readAnd 10 photos from location all 5 by 8's I guess u could frame these and have them they are glossy and nice but all in all not really needed eitherSo in conclution it's a DVD set but its not worth $29 of $31 if you want this one I recommend getting it like I did in the John Wayne John Ford Collection. Other wise get the Two Disc Anniversary Edition. Or do what I usually do wait 6 months and get them from a seller for 10 bucks. If you own the original flip disc this makes it look like its illegitimate counsin on you moms side that no one talks about so it does improve it.",5,The Searchers THe Ultimate Edition,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,3025,"['Searchers', 'Ultimate', 'EditionFor', 'most', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fans', 'one', 'JW', 'movie', 'best', 'down', 'there', 'favorite', 'So', 'review', 'Ultimate', 'Editon', 'DVD.First', 'Packaging', 'very', 'nice', 'looking', 'box', 'brown', 'carboard', 'kinda', 'leather', 'Personally', '29.99', 'should', 'be', 'real', 'leather', 'least', 'better', 'binding', 'No', 'say', 'not', 'nice', 'cardboard', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'card', 'board', 'cases', 'rather', 'have', 'plastic', 'ones', 'tend', 'hold', 'up', 'better', 'will', 'find', '2', 'discs', 'extras.Disc', '1', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', 'ever', 'filmed', 'finally', 'great', 'transfer', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'owning', 'original', 'dvd', 'release', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'know', 'not', 'flip', 'disc', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'was', 'shot', 'story', 'search', 'woman', 'kidnapped', 'native', 'Americans', 'plains', 'Wayne', 'one', 'darkest', 'most', 'deep', 'characters', 'cinema', 'history', 'want', 'hate', 'then', 'u', 'pity', 'u', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'feeling', 'sad', 'know', 'place', 'time', 'movie', 'set', 'way', 'ford', 'violence', 'showing', 'thing', 'haunting', 'picture', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget.The', 'Sound', 'stunning', 'movie', 'age', 'did', 'remarkle', '5.1', 'mix', 'crisp', 'clear', 'total', 'packageThere', 'also', 'Commentary', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'most', 'part', 'irrelevant', 'mainly', 'cause', 'only', 'john', 'ford', 'john', 'wayne', 'would', 'do', 'kinda', 'interesting', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'twice.Disc2', 'ExtrasThe', 'Searchers', 'Appreciation', 'Featurette', 'movie', 'how', 'actors', 'others', 'feel', 'movie', 'location', 'duke', 'location', 'interesting', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'twice.A', 'Turning', 'Earth', 'John', 'Ford', 'John', 'Wayne', 'SearchersSome', 'interesting', 'info', 'starts', 'repeating', 'what', 'said', 'first', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'one', 'twice', 'Assasination', 'Jesse', 'JamesFirst', 'movie', 'theater', 'now', 'dvd', 'COMMERCIAL', 'IGNORE', 'IT.Now', 'other', 'extras', 'more', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'there', 'separate', 'insert', 'boxes', 'stuff', 'first', 'one', 'hasA', 'comic', 'book.Its', 'just', 'movie', 'comic', 'book', 'formA', 'book', 'clippingIt', 'info', 'searchers', 'time', 'newspaper', 'clipping', 'poster', 'ads', 'lots', 'stuff', 'are', 'small', '5', '8.The', 'Other', 'BoxIt', '2', 'interoffice', 'memos', 'concerns', 'movie', 'nice', 'readAnd', '10', 'photos', 'location', '5', '8', 'guess', 'u', 'could', 'frame', 'have', 'are', 'glossy', 'nice', 'not', 'really', 'needed', 'eitherSo', 'conclution', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'worth', '29', '31', 'want', 'one', 'recommend', 'getting', 'did', 'John', 'Wayne', 'John', 'Ford', 'Collection', 'Other', 'wise', 'get', 'Two', 'Disc', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'do', 'what', 'usually', 'do', 'wait', '6', 'months', 'get', 'seller', '10', 'bucks', 'own', 'original', 'flip', 'disc', 'look', 'illegitimate', 'counsin', 'moms', 'side', 'one', 'improve']",N/A

Doesn't Ethan belong to the dinasty of the mytical hero? In the purest sense of the term. His origin is not very clear. And suddenly he appears, so he leaves at the end. In this sense his efforts for searching his kidnapped niece are an epic fight against all the obstacles.And the turning point that makes that film so extraordinary, is the decission which prevails when he finally finds Debby and almost kills her. In this sense it's a personal choice. Through all his trip he has established his own code. He kills Putterman because it has to be done, and forget all the ethical reasons.But when he goes to rescue her with the group, and finally saves her, you notice he isn't very satissfied with the result.At last, all the people experiences a happy ending, but he doesn't seem to be very convinced with himself. And that's why he made a decision politically right.John Ford was the western's director per excellence. The  film has unforgettable moments, the use of the objective, the travellings and the fantastic landscape in Texas support this jewel.

(Followed closely by Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.)Ford shot in Monument Valley, one of his favorite locations, and -- wow -- do he know how to shoot. This film also displays some of his favorite visual touches -- keep an eye on the very opening moment and the closing moment. (Won't tell you more than that.) Once you've seen the film, consider David Lynch, Martin Scorsese, and a slew of other directors who pick up on Ford film styles in their own work.This may also be John Wayne's darkest role, certainly one of them. Wayne plays a real anti-hero here. Ford deliberately gives him a racist side, and that is only part of the darkness. Wayne's character of Ethan Edwards is vastly deeper and more complex than the huge majority of comparable characters in any film genre, and Wayne carries it off.The story touches on an issue that recurs through the first 200 years of American history (say 1650 to 1850, very roughly) -- the captured white person. Check out ""The Redeemed Captive"" by John Williams (written 300 years ago) and ""The Unredeemed Captive"" written by John Demos in the 1990s.Now, the Blu Ray disc:Several people have commented on the Warner Brothers presentation of the film in two aspect ratios, that commonly seen on standard definition television and a widescreen version that has the top and bottom cropped. There are some very helpful comments on this. I do not know the intentions of Warner Brothers or John Ford on presentation.The one thing I do know is that Warner Brothers has a well-established history of really mangling their films to squeeze as much money as possible out of them. They viciously overcompress signals so that compression artifacts are glaring. The have cropped films and called them ""restored versions"".

A farm is attacked by some Indians. Everyone is killed except a very young girl who is taken along by the Indian chief. The film is the story of the tracking of this chief and the salvaging, retrieval and liberation of the girl who was made the chief's wife, one of them. It shows how the girl will, when found, ask for her fellow whites to consider her life is set and settled now and that she must be left to her lot. They will fail this first time but they will go on searching for her and they will finally trap the Indian community and they will demonstrate their great generosity by killing all the Indians and only recuperating the white girl by force. At the time when the film came out it was vindicating that genocidal treatment of Indians based on the myth that the whites had the right to take Indian land without even paying for it. Today it is a perfect demonstration how deep that genocidal spirit is engrained in the American consciousness of history. We have to celebrate the very recent decision of Congress to provide some Indians with reparations for the way they were treated, even after having been parked in reservations, as a miracle of faithfulness to the principles of the Declaration of Independence, for whose Founding Fathers there was no doubt that Indians and enslaved or indentured people, mostly Black, were not born equal, because they were not born human. The film shows how the dominant culture in the USA and in Hollywood used the genocide of the Indians as a good conscience builder among the whites who were engaged in so many wars all around the world against ""minority races"".Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",4,A good I ndian is a dead Indian,1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,1835,"['film', 'slightly', 'better', 'most', 'films', 'John', 'Wayne', 'retrospective', 'farm', 'attacked', 'Indians', 'Everyone', 'killed', 'very', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'taken', 'along', 'Indian', 'chief', 'film', 'story', 'tracking', 'chief', 'salvaging', 'retrieval', 'liberation', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'made', 'chief', 'wife', 'one', 'how', 'girl', 'will', 'when', 'found', 'ask', 'fellow', 'whites', 'consider', 'life', 'set', 'settled', 'now', 'must', 'be', 'left', 'lot', 'will', 'fail', 'first', 'time', 'will', 'go', 'searching', 'will', 'finally', 'trap', 'Indian', 'community', 'will', 'demonstrate', 'great', 'generosity', 'killing', 'Indians', 'only', 'recuperating', 'white', 'girl', 'force', 'time', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'was', 'vindicating', 'genocidal', 'treatment', 'Indians', 'based', 'myth', 'whites', 'had', 'right', 'take', 'Indian', 'land', 'even', 'paying', 'Today', 'perfect', 'demonstration', 'how', 'deep', 'genocidal', 'spirit', 'engrained', 'American', 'consciousness', 'history', 'have', 'celebrate', 'very', 'recent', 'decision', 'Congress', 'provide', 'Indians', 'reparations', 'way', 'were', 'treated', 'even', 'having', 'been', 'parked', 'reservations', 'miracle', 'faithfulness', 'principles', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'there', 'was', 'doubt', 'Indians', 'enslaved', 'indentured', 'people', 'mostly', 'Black', 'were', 'not', 'born', 'equal', 'were', 'not', 'born', 'human', 'film', 'how', 'dominant', 'culture', 'USA', 'Hollywood', 'used', 'genocide', 'Indians', 'good', 'conscience', 'builder', 'whites', 'who', 'were', 'engaged', 'so', 'many', 'wars', 'world', 'minority', 'races', '.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

The Reverend, for instance, opposes the continued shooting at attacking Indians once they have started to retreat.In time, Edwards finds out that Chief Scarface has his niece. But how to approach him without endangering Debbie's life?  The plot continues to build. In time, Edwards arranges a meeting with Chief Scarface. He is shown a belt of scalps, including those of his murdered relatives. He sees the now-teenaged Debbie, but she now considers the Comanches as ""her people"".

Released at very nearly the midpoint of the American filmmaking experience (1956), directed by The Great American Director (John Ford), starring The Great American Actor (John Wayne), and filmed in The Great American Genre (The Western), THE SEARCHERS embodies American film as perhaps none other. But John Ford filmed other westerns starring John Wayne in the middle of the last century. What makes THE SEARCHERS stand out?THE SEARCHERS is an adult western which addresses themes largely absent in the genre up to that point: psychological conflict, racism, rape, and massacre. The film is far more violent than any other Ford western up to that point, and the line between hero and villain is blurrier. Disaster strikes early in this film, and the rest of the movie is a complex narrative about picking up those broken pieces that remain after such a tragedy. The epic timeframe of the movie allows complexity to seep into the characters realistically and believably.Most old-time westerns seem dated to me today; I grew up after the heyday of cowboy films. THE SEARCHERS is one of those rare movies, however that transcends not only its genre, but the decade in which it was made. A fan of classic cinema, I steered away from westerns for many years, not thinking them worthy of being considered great films. After viewing THE SEARCHERS, I knew that I was wrong. No library of classic American film would be complete without this movie.Jeremy W. Forstadt",5,"""We'll find 'em.

106024,A3J9LLWHZH15HG,0790736918,JJ,"[1, 2]","I want to say from the start that I am not a real fan of westerns and I am not a real fan of John Wayne. I found him to be a very nice looking, likeable guy but he always played ""John Wayne"". BUT, in this instance, and again in True Grit, playing John Wayne is the perfect thing to do. This is a movie I've never forgotten and when, rarely, it pops up on t.v. I always watch it. It just grabs you from the first gorgeous scene of the doorway. Reading the reviews was very informative as it kept me from ordering the 2 disc anniversary version and I'm usually a sucker for those. One of the reviews said that the 2 disc version was much too dark in several places. I ordered the l997 single disc version and it was beautiful. Not as digitally remastered as maybe some later versions are. If there is anyone out there that has not seen ""The Searchers"" because it's an old John Wayne western, then put a copy in your cart immediately. You wont be sorry. Come to think about it, maybe John Wayne was always a better actor than I thought. In small subtle ways he told me in this movie of his great love for the murdered woman which to me was the driving force behind his obsession to find the girl. I believe that he thought of her as the only remaining link with the woman he adored. I've looked at the first few scenes of this movie several times. The interaction between ""Martha"" and ""Ethan"" is beautiful to watch. Her slowly stepping back into the doorway while unable to take her eyes off his face is genius either on her part or the part of the director. With nothing but the looks on their faces and subtle body language they both convey the great love they have for each other right up until he rides away. The scene of her standing in a room alone holding his coat and rubbing her hands over it is genius, nothing less. No  explanation is ever given of why they did not marry or how she came to be married to his brother. Great directing, possibly even greater acting. This is John Wayne's masterpiece. The only thing that I found annoying was the heavy handed humor in a few places particularly the fight scene at the wedding and Patrick Wayne's youthful blundering near the end of the movie. Maybe Papa John just wanted him in the movie. But, maybe this humor acted to keep the drama from becoming too intense. Maybe it's a true picture of how people on the frontier actually behaved. John Ford certainly knew more about directing than I do and that's for sure.  The other thing I noticed and I'm afflicted with noticing things like this. HOW ON EARTH WERE THESE PEOPLE EARNING A LIVING OUT THERE. There is no grass for cattle or horses. Nothing but dirt and a little scrub grass. Never saw a garden. Where did the wood come from to use on that rather large house and the furniture. I guess we aren't supposed to wonder about these things. If I hadn't seen it so many times I guess I wouldn't notice things like that. ADDED COMMENTS. I went against the suggestion of the person who said the 2 disc version was not very good, too dark in many places. I decided I wanted to see the extra features so ordered it. I've just looked at over half of it and do not find any problems at all with too much darkness. It seems to me to be beautifully restored and better visually than the l997 one disc version I already have. It is my opinion that the reviewer who got the too dark disc should return it for another copy.

Mainly because, faced with seeming insurmontable obstacles, Wayne keeps searching for his niece for years.  It is amazing how the years pass in the film, and you realize, what it must have taken for the character to keep trying, driving himself day after day.There are some cute moments in the movie, but John Wayne's passion to find his niece is just a classic piece of film making.I remember watching a special about the movie and was intrigued at how much work went into filming on location in Arizona.  Ford really was a motivator and a genius when it came to film, and this was one of his favorites from what I remember.If you like John Wayne movies, you just love this.  Natalie Wood does a great job as his niece grown up.I think it is a great lesson of life, however, the interest here is that in a time when murder and mayhem reigned in the Southwest, the passion of the time saw extremes in hatred on both sides of the racial divide.Finally, it is really just a great story and very well done movie.",5,"Wayne's Focus, Tenacity, Grit and Vehemence makes this a must see movie.",1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1074,"['think', 'Searchers', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'Mainly', 'faced', 'seeming', 'insurmontable', 'obstacles', 'Wayne', 'searching', 'niece', 'years', 'amazing', 'how', 'years', 'pass', 'film', 'realize', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'character', 'keep', 'trying', 'driving', 'day', 'day.There', 'are', 'cute', 'moments', 'movie', 'John', 'Wayne', 'passion', 'find', 'niece', 'just', 'classic', 'piece', 'film', 'making.I', 'remember', 'watching', 'special', 'movie', 'was', 'intrigued', 'how', 'much', 'work', 'went', 'filming', 'location', 'Arizona', 'Ford', 'really', 'was', 'motivator', 'genius', 'when', 'came', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'what', 'remember.If', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'just', 'love', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'great', 'job', 'niece', 'grown', 'up.I', 'think', 'great', 'lesson', 'life', 'however', 'interest', 'here', 'time', 'when', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'reigned', 'Southwest', 'passion', 'time', 'saw', 'extremes', 'hatred', 'sides', 'racial', 'divide.Finally', 'really', 'just', 'great', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie']",N/A

Well, it is moments- visual or lyrical moments.  Moments- good or bad that burn into your mind and are hard to forget.  A good movie has these moments.  Well, the Searchers has many of these moments.  The film opens with the camera looking out of a dark cabin as a door opens to a western vista with sun, and clouds, and landscape that is just beautiful.  This is a ""wow"" moment probably much better when seen on a big screen in an old movie theatre.  Then there is a scene that i cant get out of my head, where John Wayne and his comrade confront some white women who've gone crazy from being captured and brutalized by indians.  The look on the women's faces were haunting only to be outdone by the look on John Wayne's face as he leaves the room.  He turns to look again and the camera closes in on his anguished and angered face.  Almost like their mental sickness is inhabiting him for a moment.  This alone could be why this movie is Wayne's greatest acting moment.  Unbelievable.  Then finally, the last scene seen through that same doorway (actually a different doorway) looking out onto the wild wild west with John Wayne looking in at his family and friends.  Then he wheels around in the best iconic John Wayne move and walks away.  Almost like a Charlie Chaplin bittersweet ending -but western style.

The story begins with war veteran Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) returning home to his brother after having been on the road for years after the Civil War.  However, Ethan does not get to spend much time with his family as they are soon massacred by Comanche's lead by chief Scar.  The only person that seems to have survived is his niece Debbie, and Ethan is determined to find her as he sets out with Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter).  Martin, a half-Indian, is a peaceful and reasonable man who was adopted by the family.  Ethan is the opposite with strong racist beliefs, which trickle out around Ethan's persona.  The story surrounds the violent veteran, Ethan, and the naive innocence of Martin, which sets up strong contrasts between the two characters in the long journey.

You cannot go wrong buying this DVD - it delivers!Now considered possibly the greatest weatern movie of all-time, ""The Searchers"" was panned by the critics of its day for being just another ""ho-hum"" John Wayne western.  It took years, but modern critics and viewers now recognize it as an epic of western filmmaking that perhaps will never be topped.  If I had to choose one movie that represented the best of the west, it is undoubtedly ""The Searchers"".John Wayne gives his most intense acting performance as the dark and vengeful Ethan Edwards, who vows to kill the Commanche raiders that murdered his beloved sister-in-law, brother, and took captive two of their daughters.  Wayne easily carries the film on his broad brooding shoulders, pursuing the Indians for over 5 years through summer and winter, ever relentless to see their chief, ""Scar"", dead, and his captive nieces rescued.Director John Ford is at the height of his creative powers in directing this western masterpiece.  He weaves so many different themes and levels of interpretation into the film, that one discovers something new with each viewing.  It would take a small treatise to bring out all the subtle details.Succinctly and to the point, ""The Searchers"" is a film that you will watch again and again, and love it each time a bit more.  It is that absolute best in western filmmaking!Jim Konedog Koenig",5,Unquestionably John Wayne's Best Film,1121990400,"07 22, 2005",2005,1665,"['site', 'are', '100', 'fan-reviews', 'movie', 'many', 'tell', 'plot', 'great', 'detail', 'therefore', 'reivew', 'will', 'be', 'short', 'sweet', 'great', 'John', 'Ford', 'directing', 'John', 'Wayne', 'starring', 'superb', 'story', 'line', 'up', '5-star', 'movie', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'buying', 'DVD', 'Now', 'considered', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'weatern', 'movie', 'all-time', 'Searchers', 'was', 'panned', 'critics', 'day', 'being', 'just', 'ho-hum', 'John', 'Wayne', 'western', 'took', 'years', 'modern', 'critics', 'viewers', 'now', 'recognize', 'epic', 'western', 'filmmaking', 'perhaps', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'topped', 'had', 'choose', 'one', 'movie', 'represented', 'best', 'west', 'undoubtedly', 'Searchers', '.John', 'Wayne', 'most', 'intense', 'acting', 'performance', 'dark', 'vengeful', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'who', 'kill', 'Commanche', 'raiders', 'murdered', 'beloved', 'sister-in-law', 'brother', 'took', 'captive', 'two', 'daughters', 'Wayne', 'easily', 'film', 'broad', 'brooding', 'shoulders', 'pursuing', 'Indians', '5', 'years', 'summer', 'winter', 'ever', 'relentless', 'see', 'chief', 'Scar', 'dead', 'captive', 'nieces', 'rescued.Director', 'John', 'Ford', 'height', 'creative', 'powers', 'directing', 'western', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'themes', 'levels', 'interpretation', 'film', 'one', 'discovers', 'something', 'new', 'viewing', 'would', 'take', 'small', 'treatise', 'bring', 'out', 'subtle', 'details.Succinctly', 'point', 'Searchers', 'film', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'love', 'time', 'bit', 'more', 'absolute', 'best', 'western', 'filmmaking', 'Jim', 'Konedog', 'Koenig']",N/A
106055,A2ICI500LRO01K,0790736918,Kyle Wells,"[5, 9]","Okay, let's get it said and out of the way: ""The Searchers"" is one of the greatest films ever made. There, it's done. We can move on now. It can be hard to view, and harder still to write about, a film with such reputation for greatness and such a deep background of commentary as John Ford's 1956 classic. The film holds great cultural weight and a completely objective approach to the film is, for most, impossible. It is the most quintessential film of the most quintessential American genre, and its themes and characters take on infinite meaning towards the country and people they represent. It is perhaps the richest western ever produced in both scale and content. And yet ""The Searchers"" is really two films in one, and while many like to conveniently ignore its failures, they still fall from the screen cold and lifeless whenever viewed. The film is great because of its challenge to the commonly held notions of history, both cinematic and actual, that have produced it, and yet it still gets caught up in the pitfalls it at other moments so brilliantly rejects. For as much as we would like it to not be, ""The Searchers"" is still a studio film of Old Hollywood, and a western to boot, and despite it undisputable greatness, at times in the film this is painfully evident.The first film that ""The Searchers"" is, is truly one of the greats of the cinema. It is the story of the hatred, vengeance, obsession, and violence that drives a hard man for five years is search of his niece. It is a gloriously wrought commentary on the attitudes and spirit of the men who founded America and who, as one character laments, need to be dead and buried before any sort of civility can be found. It contains one of the greatest performances ever filmed, with John Wayne as Ethan Edwards, a loner and racist, whose self-destructive drive and bitter hatred give him the means by which to get the job done. Wayne's performance is fierce and exhilarating, and the talent and energy behind it is nothing short of inspired. The other talent at work is John Ford, whose brilliance behind the camera was never so evident as with this film. Ford made Monument Valley the ultimate symbol of the American west, and he displays it here with the respect, awe, and scope is deserves. Many shots are breathtaking, a few worthy of the cold shiver up the spine that only the true masters of film are able to instill. Some are appropriately renowned, such as Wayne's final stance at close, but the majority of the film is near equal in execution. Books could be, and have been, written on the film and still only begin to explain its triumphs.And yet, the other, less discussed film that ""The Searchers"" is, is a studio western of the most clich&eacute;d variety and a film that is unable, no matter how ambitiously it tries, to rise above the conventions of the genre. Whether studio pressure can be blamed I couldn't say, but Ford, for all his inventiveness and all his unbound talent, still manages to hoke it up with the best of them. ""The Searchers"" is not a completely perfect film, and some of the material used to contrast the tale of Edwards and his obsessive hunt can be painful to watch. In any other film, and indeed in many of Ford's other efforts, scenes such as the fistfight and the love story between Vera Miles and Jeffrey Hunter may hold a certain Old Hollywood charm, but set against the brilliance of the rest of this film they stick out like a sore thumb. They are the sort of scenes that can make you embarrassed to be so in praise of the film when an unknowing roommate casually chuckles at the hokey old Western you're watching. One could take a step back and analyze Ford's negotiations with the conventions of the genre, and reflect on the meaning behind the contrast, but to my eye, when viewed straight on as an unfortunately sizeable portion of the film, these scenes do no more than detract from an otherwise incredible film. Some of them work, sure, such as the breakfast scene earlier in the film, and many scenes with Ward Bond, but just as many others fall flat. Ford had the means to make something truly unique and exhilarating, but unfortunately was unable or unwilling to fully realize his vision.So like so many before me I will give the film five stars, call it a classic, and try to ignore its many failures upon my many future viewings. Watching it this time I considered muting most of the parts where Wayne and Hunter pause their search for a respite with Ford's `characters,' but the film is what it is, and while perhaps these bits should be taken with less seriousness then the rest of the film, they are for better or worse a part of it. I want to justify them and take that step back, declare that these scenes are necessary in order to appreciate the film's true successes. I want to explain that the awkwardness and clich&eacute; of the more stereotypical western scenes is intentionally used to somehow draw attention to notions of legend versus reality. But I have trouble doing so, and instead, as with many other `great' films, choose to forgive its failures and declare it another flawed masterpiece. Two films can be found here, one brilliant, the other embarrassingly trite, but yet ""The Searchers"" is a film that has and will forever command respect, analysis, and multiple awestruck viewings.",5,On the Edge of Perfection,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,5334,"['Okay', 'let', 'get', 'said', 'way', 'Searchers', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'done', 'can', 'move', 'now',

Becuase if one isn't careful, the Western can b degraded to a strictly by the numbers exercise.  More than any other film the Western is predictable.  So, someone decided that every Western needed a hook.  Be it a grand forest fire(like Last of the Cowboys) or a wild stampede(lik Snowy River) every Western needed a hook.So, where's the hook in The Searchers?  The action sequences are well done, but they have been done before.  There is humor enough from characters like Ward Bond and Wayne's sidekick and his love life.  But the hook lies elsewhere.Charactere development.  So simple, but sad to say, ignored for the most part by Western movie makers.  (Excepting Unforgiven, Sagecoach and a few other notables.)  Wayne gives the best performance of his life in this movie.  Ethan Edwards is by far one of th greatest characters to come out of the WEstern genre, ranked up there with Shane in my opinion.  An academy award was well deserved for Wayne.  The line,&quot;They ain't white,&quot; sends shivers down my spine every time I see it.The AFI says this is one of the best movies ever made, ranking it at number 95.

There's an urban legend that he worked tirelessly to get James Arness the starring role in the new TV series ""Gunsmoke"" because Arness was one of the few actors actually bigger physically than the Duke and Wayne didn't want any competition in that department on the silver screen.The time is 1868. The Civil War less than three years ended. Wayne returns, a Confederate soldier, to his brother's ranch out west. Here is Wayne at his best, not a nice Wayne, not a compassionate Wayne, not a friendly Wayne but one seeking retribution for the murder of his brother and his brother's family by the indians. He sets his code, his raison d'etre if you will, and sticks to it.

Touted as one of the greatest westerns ever filmed, it is, I will grant you, an entertaining film. In it, John Wayne plays the anti-hero, Ethan Edwards, an ex-confederate soldier, who goes to Texas in 1868 to visit his brother and his family on their ranch. While visiting, a report of marauding Indians in adjacent land draws out the Texas Rangers, and Ethan joins them. When they discover that a decoy has been used to lure them away from the settlement, they hurry back, only to find that Ethan's family was massacred and his two nieces gone, taken captive by Comanche Indians.Ethan goes to the rescue, joined by Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), a friend of the family who is himself part Indian. After a while, they discover that only the younger niece, Debbie, has survived. Their quest to bring Debbie back, or so Martin thinks, takes place over a period of five years. At some point along the way, Ethan's relentless quest for Debbie seems to undergo a transition from rescue mission to execution squad in the belief that it is better to be dead than to have ""gone Injun"".The film suffers somewhat from revisionist history and its own stereotypic portrayal of Indians. They are portrayed as either savages or buffoons fit only to be the butt of jokes. Moreover, the character of Ethan is an enigma, as he changes from heartbroken uncle to death squad killer in his relentless search for his surviving niece. Ethan embodies hatred and racism, concepts that are tantalizingly laid out but never fully examined or explored, which is why Ethan remains an enigma.Debbie, played as a child by Lana Wood and as a teenager by Lana's older sister, Natalie Wood, is a symbol from whom Ethan's character gets its raison d'etre. It is she who gives him the will to go on, whether it be for the right or wrong reasons is another issue. Natalie Wood is lovely as the older Debbie, though the makeup has to go, as it serves to take away from the rusticity of the film and jerk the viewer back to Hollywood. This was typical of films in those days. No matter what the situation, the women were always in full makeup.Still, notwithstanding some of the film's political incorrectness and incongruent production values, it is still an entertaining film and about as good as westerns get. John Wayne is memorable as Ethan Edwards. Handsome Jeffrey Hunter gives an excellent performance as Martin Pawley. Ward Bond, as captain of the Texas Rangers, is terrific. The rest of the supporting cast give performances that vary in quality. Still, this film remains the quintessential western flick and one worth watching.",4,QUINTESSENTIAL CLASSIC WESTERN...,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,2743,"['film', 'directed', 'legendary', 'John', 'Ford', 'starring', 'John', 'Wayne', 'leading', 'role', 'western', 'achieved', 'mythic', 'proportions', 'Touted', 'one', 'greatest', 'westerns', 'ever', 'filmed', 'will', 'grant', 'entertaining', 'film', 'John', 'Wayne', 'anti-hero', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'ex-confederate', 'soldier', 'who', 'Texas', '1868', 'visit', 'brother', 'family', 'ranch', 'visiting', 'report', 'marauding', 'Indians', 'adjacent', 'land', 'out', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'Ethan', 'When', 'discover', 'decoy', 'been', 'used', 'lure', 'away', 'settlement', 'hurry', 'back', 'only', 'find', 'Ethan', 'family', 'was', 'massacred', 'two', 'nieces', 'gone', 'taken', 'captive', 'Comanche', 'Indians.Ethan', 'rescue', 'joined', 'Martin', 'Pawley', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'friend', 'family', 'who', 'part', 'Indian', 'while', 'discover', 'only', 'younger', 'niece', 'Debbie', 'survived', 'quest', 'bring', 'Debbie', 'back', 'so', 'Martin', 'thinks', 'place', 'period', 'five', 'years', 'point', 'way', 'Ethan', 'relentless', 'quest', 'Debbie', 'undergo', 'transition', 'rescue', 'mission', 'execution', 'squad', 'belief', 'better', 'be', 'dead', 'have', 'gone', 'Injun', '.The', 'film', 'suffers', 'somewhat', 'revisionist', 'history', 'own', 'stereotypic', 'portrayal', 'Indians', 'are', 'portrayed', 'savages', 'buffoons', 'fit', 'only', 'be', 'butt', 'jokes', 'Moreover', 'character', 'Ethan', 'enigma', 'heartbroken', 'uncle', 'death', 'squad', 'killer', 'relentless', 'search', 'surviving', 'niece', 'Ethan', 'hatred', 'racism', 'concepts', 'are', 'tantalizingly', 'laid', 'out', 'never', 'fully', 'examined', 'explored', 'why', 'Ethan', 'enigma.Debbie', 'played', 'child', 'Lana', 'Wood', 'teenager', 'Lana', 'older', 'sister', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'symbol', 'whom', 'Ethan', 'character', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'who', 'will', 'go', 'be', 'right', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'issue', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'lovely', 'older', 'Debbie', 'makeup', 'go', 'take', 'away', 'rusticity', 'film', 'jerk', 'viewer', 'back', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'typical', 'films', 'days', 'matter', 'what', 'situation', 'women', 'were', 'always', 'full', 'makeup.Still', 'notwithstanding', 'film', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'incongruent', 'production', 'values', 'still', 'entertaining', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'westerns', 'get', 'John', 'Wayne', 'memorable', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'Handsome', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Martin', 'Pawley', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'captain', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'terrific', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'give', 'performances', 'vary', 'quality', 'Still', 'film', 'quintessential', 'western', 'flick', 'one', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

He's either mildly  bemused or angry. I'll never understand what the fuss is about.  We are  taken through one set piece after another until the end when Wayne realizes  in an instant he was wrong all along. The thing is, he never seemed to  learn anything about racism at all.

Virtually everything about the movie remains timeless and its quality proves to be near perfect in almost every way. This movie should dispelled for all times, the fiction that John Wayne cannot act but himself. This movie was Wayne's greatest acting job. This was clearly shown early in the film when Wayne's character realized that his brother's ranch may be doom, the stricken look on that face remains priceless as it conveyed the horror of his mistake and despair behind the stoic behavior. Anyway, with so many previous reviews, I won't go further repeating what been written already.This DVD edition is definitely the ultimate edition as movie of this type could go. The movie image from this edition proves to be a superior improvement from the earlier edition that came out several years ago. The image proves to be clean, color vivid and it almost pristine. The soundtrack is clear, the audio is your basic mono but its also clear.The second disc contained all the extra documentaries. Both documentaries, ""The Searcher: A Appreciation"" and ""Turning of the Earth: John Ford, John Wayne and The Searchers"" proves to be insightful, interesting and entertaining.This edition also contains a copy of a 1956 Dell comic book on the movie. It been reduced in size but still readable. I supposed it useful to introduced the story without watching the movie. There is also a b/w booklet that contains many versions of the movie posters, and contemporary media hype on the movie. The other package contains collection of b/w back scene photos which is quite nice.There's also a coupon for a free The Searchers' movie reproduced poster. Unfortunately, the offer expired back several months ago.For people who don't want the extra material, there is the regular two disc edition which is bit cheaper.Overall, the ultimate edition sound bit overpriced but depending on how die-hard John Wayne fan you may be, the cost may be subjective.",5,Ultimate John Wayne movie,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,2118,"['review', 'Ultimate', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'came', 'out', 'year.I', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'stated', 'Searchers', 'John', 'Wayne', 'greatest', 'film', 'Virtually', 'everything', 'movie', 'timeless', 'quality', 'be', 'near', 'perfect', 'almost', 'way', 'movie', 'should', 'dispelled', 'times', 'fiction', 'John', 'Wayne', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'movie', 'was', 'Wayne', 'greatest', 'acting', 'job', 'was', 'clearly', 'shown', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'Wayne', 'character', 'realized', 'brother', 'ranch', 'may', 'be', 'doom', 'stricken', 'look', 'face', 'priceless', 'conveyed', 'horror', 'mistake', 'despair', 'stoic', 'behavior', 'Anyway', 'so', 'many', 'previous', 'reviews', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'repeating', 'what', 'been', 'written', 'already.This', 'DVD', 'edition', 'definitely', 'ultimate', 'edition', 'movie', 'type', 'could', 'go', 'movie', 'image', 'edition', 'be', 'superior', 'improvement', 'earlier', 'edition', 'came', 'out', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'image', 'be', 'clean', 'color', 'vivid', 'almost', 'pristine', 'soundtrack', 'clear', 'audio', 'basic', 'mono', 'also', 'clear.The', 'second', 'disc', 'contained', 'extra', 'documentaries', 'documentaries', 'Searcher', 'Appreciation', 'Turning', 'Earth', 'John', 'Ford', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Searchers', 'be', 'insightful', 'interesting', 'entertaining.This', 'edition', 'also', 'copy', '1956', 'Dell', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'been', 'reduced', 'size', 'still', 'readable', 'supposed', 'useful', 'introduced', 'story', 'watching', 'movie', 'also', 'b/w', 'booklet', 'many', 'versions', 'movie', 'posters', 'contemporary', 'media', 'hype', 'movie', 'other', 'package', 'collection', 'b/w', 'back', 'scene', 'photos', 'quite', 'also', 'coupon', 'free', 'Searchers', 'movie', 'reproduced', 'poster', 'Unfortunately', 'offer', 'expired', 'back', 'several', 'months', 'ago.For', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'extra', 'material', 'regular', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'bit', 'cheaper.Overall', 'ultimate', 'edition', 'sound', 'bit', 'overpriced', 'depending', 'how', 'die-hard', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fan', 'may', 'be', 'cost', 'may', 'be', 'subjective']",N/A

This is widely considered one of the greatest westerns ever made but there are a couple things that detracted me from giving it five stars.1. Vera Miles as Laurie, Martin's love interest. I cringed about 90% of the time she was on screen because she always seems on the verge of an emotional breakdown. She screamed, wailed, moaned and wouldn't let up. Her voice is so brittle, harsh and grating and she says almost all her lines like she's trying to make a crowd of half deaf 90 year olds hear her. My goodness, her narration of Martin's letter was so painful I wanted to holler &#34;Tone it down! We can hear you!&#34; John Ford should have cast Donna Reed or Eva Marie Saint for a gentler, more refined interpretation.2. Patrick Wayne as the Lieutenant says almost all of his lines in the same, mouth-open, mouth-shut, monotone cadence like he's sight reading the script. If he hadn't been the son of John Wayne, he would have been laughed off the set for his audition.But even with these annoyances, I still enjoyed the film. The plot is very engaging, the pacing crisp and tight and the desert cinematography contains rich, lush colors like an oil painting.John Wayne is one of those movie stars who just play variations on himself, like Humphrey Bogart. You have to either take him as he is or leave him alone. Natalie Wood just stands around looking prettily made up.Best of all is Jeffrey Hunter. He is wonderfully handsome and makes a strong, broad impression as the hot-headed but courageous Martin who risks all for the one he loves. My favorite of his scenes is where he tells Ethan off for disowning Deborah and his interactions with the Indian woman he unknowingly 'bought&#8217; at the settlement.All in all, The Searchers is good, solid entertainment.

106073,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,0790736918,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","I was told that THE SEARCHERS was perhaps the best John Wayne movie ever made. Believe it or not, I'd never seen it before. So when I saw that the blu-ray was on sale at amazon for under $10 I decided what the heck, let's give it a go. I'm glad I did.Wayne stars as Ethan Edwards, a rough and tumble man of the west comes home after fighting for the south in the Civil War. As the film opens, we see a woman through the front door of her house, Wayne on horseback riding to the house. This is the home of his brother and his family, a home that Ethan knew before the war. As the film moves on we get the idea that there was once something between Ethan and Martha, his brother's wife, but nothing is said aloud.Ethan is greeted by his brother and his family, a nephew, two nieces and a young man named Martin Polly (Jeffrey Hunter) who Ethan saved as a child, the sole survivor of an Indian attack on a wagon train. But the reunion doesn't last long when the next morning a group of men on horseback show led by Rev. Capt. Clayton (Ward Bond). It seems a group of Indians have run off with homesteader Jorgensen's cattle and they're about to search for them. Ethan insists his brother remain home but Martin goes along.Following the trail they discover that the cattle were stolen for a reason: to get them away from the settler's homes so they could be attacked. They split when riding back to cover both places. Ethan and Martin return to find the farm ablaze and the bodies of everyone but Lucy and Debbie, the two nieces now presumed kidnapped. This ignites a search that last most of the film as Ethan and Martin head out to rescue the girls.It would be so easy to offer bits and pieces of the story now, to tell you who makes it when and who doesn't. But that would take away what is an effective piece of story telling done by master director John Ford. He and Wayne made many movies together and many consider this one to be their best. The way he frames scenes, the way he moves his actors is amazing and in turn presents a story that you don't realize until it finishes.Watching the extras also helped me see so many of the things I missed while watching. We're a movie going public used to extreme violence when watching films these days. This film offers up violent images without actually showing them. The scene where Wayne enters what appears to be a smoke house to find the bodies of his brother and sister in law is gripping. You know how he found them by the look on his face, not by seeing the actual bodies. And in some ways that's more disturbing.One thing I was aware of with this film was the subtle discussion of racism involved in it. Made when this was a somewhat taboo topic, Ford and Wayne brought it to the forefront here. Several characters have this discriminatory view of the Indians in the film that carries on to their captives as well. The search for the girls takes 5 years and during that time young Debbie becomes a woman. The question of whether to bring her back or to kill her since she's been touched in more ways than one by her captor is central to the film. On one hand Ethan is ready to do what he considers his duty in killing her, on the other Martin, part Indian himself, is willing to do all he can to stop Ethan.This film offered something different for Wayne than previous roles. Before he was the hero, the cowboy, the one guy everyone wanted to be. As Ethan he's questionable at times whether it's wondering where he got the money he gives his brother or in the way he handles various situations. As the film progresses we witness a slow change over the years as Ethan's search for vengeance causes him to do worse deeds than when the search began. He's not a nice guy but he is someone you wish was on your side.The entire cast does a commendable job here. Each of them plays their roles note perfect. Veteran actors who starred in numerous Wayne films present themselves here as well as they've ever done. Ward Bond is cantankerous and at the same time a viable force for the old west. Hank Worden as Mose Harper portrays the man as perhaps simple but at the same time perhaps not. Maybe it's a face he puts on to keep out of harm's way. But the best cast member is Monument Valley.Like almost all of Ford's westerns, this one was shot in Monument Valley. Cut off from civilization for real, the cast and crew weathered some truly dangerous moments to bring this film to life. But its worth it was you view some breathtaking scenery.

106077,A1U360OMVQRPUB,0790736918,Mel Odom,"[9, 10]","I just watched THE SEARCHERS on HD DVD and was extremely impressed.  The color transfer is absolutely brilliant.  The colors are vibrant and alive, and the Utah badlands where the film was shot is gloriously represented in shape, shadow, and shade.  The film was originally shot in Technicolor in 1956, but I had no idea what the quality would be like until I popped the disc in and the first few frames started playing.  The wide, sweeping shots through the camera lens are breath-taking, but the filtered effects to do the ""night"" shots hold a glow to them and sharpness of the actors' shadows that just isn't possible in true dark.  Still, rather than being distracting, it's more indicative of the process that was used.John Wayne stars as Ethan Edwards, a Confederate cavalry man returning to his brother's farm after three years of wandering.  No soon is the family introduced than Ethan is called away to help track a band of Indian horse thieves.  But the trail is just a ruse and the Texas Rangers end up getting back too late to save their loved ones.  This starts up a manhunt for the last little girl from the family.  The trail crosses thousands of miles and five years, and involves changes within the characters.THE SEARCHERS was the 12th film John Wayne worked on with John Ford, and it stands the test of time as one of their greatest achievements.Although the story is a slower-paced than present-day tales would be, it encompasses a lot of territory and a lot of emotion.  Some of the accents(such as Ken Curtis's portrayal of Charlie McCory) were too pronounced and struck a false note.  And Jeffrey Hunter's emotional outlets were sometimes too forced.  The action sequences were given short shrift by today's standards as well, but on the plus side, a lot happens in the two hours of movie time.Western fans and John Wayne fans have probably already got this one.  If not, they should.  But the HD DVD version is definitely a reason to start thinking about plunking down hard-earned cash to upgrade the home entertainment system.",4,HD DVD Tech Just Keeps Getting Better,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,2051,"['just', 'watched', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'HD', 'DVD', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'color', 'transfer', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'alive', 'Utah', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'gloriously', 'represented', 'shape', 'shadow', 'shade', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'Technicolor', '1956', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'quality', 'would', 'be', 'popped', 'disc', 'first', 'few', 'frames', 'started', 'playing', 'wide', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'camera', 'are', 'breath-taking', 'filtered', 'effects', 'do', 'night', 'shots', 'hold', 'glow', 'sharpness', 'actors', 'shadows', 'just', ""n't"", 'possible', 'true', 'dark', 'Still', 'rather', 'being', 'distracting', 'more', 'indicative', 'process', 'was', 'used.John', 'Wayne', 'stars', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'Confederate', 'cavalry', 'man', 'returning', 'brother', 'farm', 'three', 'years', 'wandering', 'soon', 'family', 'introduced', 'Ethan', 'called', 'away', 'help', 'track', 'band', 'Indian', 'horse', 'thieves', 'trail', 'just', 'ruse', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'back', 'too', 'late', 'save', 'loved', 'ones', 'up', 'manhunt', 'last', 'little', 'girl', 'family', 'trail', 'thousands', 'miles', 'five', 'years', 'changes', 'characters.THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'was', '12th', 'film', 'John', 'Wayne', 'worked', 'John', 'Ford', 'test', 'time', 'one', 'greatest', 'story', 'slower-paced', 'present-day', 'tales', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'territory', 'lot', 'emotion', 'accents', 'such', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'portrayal', 'Charlie', 'McCory', 'were', 'too', 'pronounced', 'struck', 'false', 'note', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'emotional', 'outlets', 'were', 'sometimes', 'too', 'forced', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'today', 'standards', 'well', 'plus', 'side', 'lot', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'time.Western', 'fans', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fans', 'have', 'probably', 'already', 'got', 'one', 'not', 'should', 'HD', 'DVD', 'version', 'definitely', 'reason', 'start', 'thinking', 'plunking', 'down', 'hard-earned', 'cash', 'upgrade', 'home', 'entertainment', 'system']",N/A

Monument Valley is stunning and director John Ford photographs it so nicely that the scenery almost takes over the story! Filmakers would leave those scenics to Ford alone, out of respect as if he made the area HIS private portrait studio.Martin Scorcesse commented that in the last shot of the last scene -John Wayne is standing on the porch (the same set as the opening shot) but this time he crosses his arm a perculiar way-which was a spontaneous gesture of respect for the Western actor  Harry Cary who made that ""pose"" his trademark.

Judged by that standard, few films are greater than ""The Searchers,""  pieces of some of the greatest films ever made have their genesis in this John Ford masterpiece.The scene in ""Star Wars"" where Luke Skywalker returns home to find his aunt and uncle dead? Yep, that's from ""The searchers,"" right down to a windswept Luke looking briefly away when the enormity of what happened hits him.The opening shot, framed by a doorway opening into the desert vastness and a woman walking out of it, has been incorporated into dozens of films, the latest being ""Kill Bill, Volume 2.""The story of a sociopathic bigot trying to rescue a young girl trapped with a bunch of savages? Hey, wasn't that the basic plot of ""Taxi Driver""?In addition to being a cinematic touchpiece for generations of filmmakers, ""The Searchers"" stands on its own as a truly great film experience, probably most notable for its stunning visuals, John Wayne's greatest performance, and a slightly more nuanced approach to the ""cowboys and Indians"" conflict that marked the coming of the revisionist Western.If nothing else, ""The Searchers"" is a gorgeous film to look at, with some of the most well-known visuals in film history. The most famous images, of course, are of the opening and closing ""doorway"" shots, but the desert scenes have enduring grace and power. If Wayne is the star of this film, the desert is his co-star.Wayne's complex, powerful portrayal of Ethan not only defined his career, but also helped define a new kind of character that would soon become known as an ""antihero."" Before long, the antihero would redefine cinema in films like ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" and even ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""Much has been written about the attitude towards native Americans in ""The Searchers,"" but this much is pretty clear: it's a whole lot more nuanced than the Westerns of its day. The famous climactic scene in which Wayne's character picks up his niece (who he'd vowed to kill because she was living with Cherokees) and takes her home seems to be an admittance that his bigotry is wrong. When the door literally closes on Wayne's character in the movie's legendary closing shot, the message is pretty clear: he might have done the right thing by bringing his niece home, but his attitudes are no longer acceptable, and he is denied redemption.That's a pretty powerful anti-bigotry message by 1956 standards, and like so much else in ""The Searchers,"" it, too, lived on.",5,The quintessential Western,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,2591,"['One', 'signs', 'film', 'truly', 'great', 'thematically', 'visually', 'films', 'follow', 'Judged', 'standard', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'greater', 'Searchers', 'pieces', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'have', 'genesis', 'John', 'Ford', 'scene', 'Star', 'Wars', 'where', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'home', 'find', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'dead', 'Yep', 'searchers', 'right', 'down', 'windswept', 'Luke', 'looking', 'briefly', 'away', 'when', 'enormity', 'what', 'happened', 'him.The', 'opening', 'shot', 'framed', 'doorway', 'opening', 'desert', 'vastness', 'woman', 'walking', 'been', 'incorporated', 'dozens', 'films', 'latest', 'being', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Volume', '2', 'story', 'sociopathic', 'bigot', 'trying', 'rescue', 'young', 'girl', 'trapped', 'bunch', 'savages', 'Hey', 'was', ""n't"", 'basic', 'plot', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'addition', 'being', 'cinematic', 'touchpiece', 'generations', 'filmmakers', 'Searchers', 'own', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'experience', 'probably', 'most', 'notable', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'John', 'Wayne', 'greatest', 'performance', 'slightly', 'more', 'nuanced', 'approach', 'cowboys', 'Indians', 'conflict', 'marked', 'coming', 'revisionist', 'Western.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'Searchers', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'look', 'most', 'well-known', 'visuals', 'film', 'history', 'most', 'famous', 'images', 'course', 'are', 'opening', 'closing', 'doorway', 'shots', 'desert', 'scenes', 'have', 'enduring', 'grace', 'power', 'Wayne', 'star', 'film', 'desert', 'co-star.Wayne', 'complex', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'Ethan', 'not', 'only', 'defined', 'career', 'also', 'helped', 'define', 'new', 'kind', 'character', 'would', 'soon', 'become', 'known', 'antihero', 'long', 'antihero', 'would', 'redefine', 'cinema', 'films', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'even', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'Much', 'been', 'written', 'attitude', 'towards', 'native', 'Americans', 'Searchers', 'much', 'pretty', 'clear', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'nuanced', 'Westerns', 'day', 'famous', 'climactic', 'scene', 'Wayne', 'character', 'up', 'niece', 'who', ""'d"", 'vowed', 'kill', 'was', 'living', 'Cherokees', 'home', 'be', 'admittance', 'bigotry', 'wrong', 'When', 'door', 'literally', 'Wayne', 'character', 'movie', 'legendary', 'closing', 'shot', 'message', 'pretty', 'clear', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'right', 'thing', 'bringing', 'niece', 'home', 'attitudes', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'acceptable', 'denied', 'redemption.That', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'anti-bigotry', 'message', '1956', 'standards', 'so', 'much', 'else', 'Searchers', 'too', 'lived']",N/A

Another example a beautiful movie like city lights jumps from 76 to 11 and Vertigo  from 61 to 9.What can i say about a movie like this that hasn't already been said, i've read reviews from Ebert and interviews with Scorsese and found it interesting that Taxi driver was influenced a great deal by the Searchers.Ethan pursues his niece Debbie, obsessed and determined to save her from the commanche indians.  In Taxi driver Travis Bickle also tries to save a young Jody Foster about the same age as Debbie from a pimp.

106088,A1FG91CM8221X1,0790736918,Miles D. Moore,"[12, 21]","I have nothing but the greatest admiration for John Ford and John Wayne. Several of their screen collaborations--Stagecoach, The Quiet Man, The Cavalry Trilogy, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and even the late, genial comedy Donovan's Reef--have a justifiable place on the list of the world's greatest films. It is now common wisdom that The Searchers was the greatest of their collaborations, certainly the greatest Western ever made, and quite possibly the greatest film in any genre. I must regretfully dissent, even though I see what people admire about the film. Wayne's performance as Ethan Edwards may well be Exhibit A for the advocates of Wayne as a great actor, not just a screen icon (Stagecoach, Red River, The Quiet Man and The Shootist are also sterling examples of Wayne's artistry). The magnificent photography of Monument Valley, effectively dwarfing the human characters, is breathtaking, and the film's scenes of stark tragedy are unforgettable (I particularly remember Harry Carey Jr,'s suicidal ride into the Indian encampment). It is the film's comic relief that leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth. There are exactly two intelligent characters in the entire movie: Ethan Edwards and Chief Scar. They are also by far the two meanest characters in the movie. They are surrounded by a bunch of well-meaning dolts who would stick out like a sore thumb in a Three Stooges short. The young lovers played by Jeffrey Hunter and Vera Miles are so abysmally stupid that we quickly cease to care about them. But Hunter and Miles are Einsteins compared with the third member of their love triangle, played so broadly by Ken Curtis that you want to belt him in the mouth every time he appears on screen. (That Miles can see anything in Curtis makes her character all the more unsympathetic.) These characters, representing what passes on the frontier for civilization, are completely unfunny and unlikable. While I realize that is Ford's point, it makes The Searchers very nearly unwatchable for me. The equation of nice=stupid and smart=mean in The Searchers goes beyond the annoying into the realms of the nihilistic. I might be a little cynical myself, but I flatly refuse to accept Ford's bitter vision in The Searchers.",3,"The greatest Western ever, or the most overrated?",1056240000,"06 22, 2003",2003,2242,"['have', 'nothing', 'greatest', 'admiration', 'John', 'Ford', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Several', 'screen', 'collaborations', 'Stagecoach', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Cavalry', 'Trilogy', 'Man', 'Who', 'Shot', 'Liberty', 'Valance', 'even', 'late', 'genial', 'comedy', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'have', 'justifiable', 'place', 'list', 'world', 'greatest', 'films', 'now', 'common', 'wisdom', 'Searchers', 'was', 'greatest', 'collaborations', 'certainly', 'greatest', 'Western', 'ever', 'made', 'quite', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'film', 'genre', 'must', 'regretfully', 'dissent', 'even', 'see', 'what', 'people', 'admire', 'film', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'Exhibit', 'A', 'advocates', 'Wayne', 'great', 'actor', 'not', 'just', 'screen', 'icon', 'Stagecoach', 'Red', 'River', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Shootist', 'are', 'also', 'sterling', 'examples', 'Wayne', 'artistry', 'magnificent', 'photography', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'effectively', 'dwarfing', 'human', 'characters', 'breathtaking', 'film', 'scenes', 'stark', 'tragedy', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'particularly', 'remember', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr', 'suicidal', 'ride', 'Indian', 'encampment', 'film', 'comic', 'relief', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouth', 'are', 'exactly', 'two', 'intelligent', 'characters', 'entire', 'movie', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'Chief', 'Scar', 'are', 'also', 'far', 'two', 'meanest', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'surrounded', 'bunch', 'well-meaning', 'dolts', 'who', 'would', 'stick', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'short', 'young', 'lovers', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'are', 'so', 'abysmally', 'stupid', 'quickly', 'cease', 'care', 'Hunter', 'Miles', 'are', 'Einsteins', 'compared', 'third', 'member', 'love', 'triangle', 'played', 'so', 'broadly', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'want', 'belt', 'mouth', 'time', 'screen', 'Miles', 'can', 'see', 'anything', 'Curtis', 'character', 'more', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'representing', 'what', 'frontier', 'civilization', 'are', 'completely', 'unfunny', 'unlikable', 'realize', 'Ford', 'point', 'Searchers', 'very', 'nearly', 'unwatchable', 'equation', 'nice=stupid', 'smart=mean', 'Searchers', 'annoying', 'realms', 'nihilistic', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'cynical', 'myself', 'flatly', 'refuse', 'accept', 'Ford', 'bitter', 'vision', 'Searchers']",N/A

But, I digress.Ethan had no intention of performing an 'honor killing'. He was on a more profound quest. He sensed that time was fickle.Look carefully at Chapter 30...you will see an automobile driving along the river road behind the troops fording the frozen stream. Note, also, the backhoe tracks in the snow (plowed trail and the mounds of ice). Ethan quietly noticed all of this, and more. The Brazos River blurring into the San Juan; flowing one way, then 'tuther'...or Texas morphing into Monument Valley. Or riding like hell for years only to end up a half mile from Edwards' cabin. Materializing Navajo blanket on the hitching-post in the opening scene. The sun's erratic motion. Look's/Martin's 'honeymoon/divorce' camp beside the reservoir, only a few hundred yards from Jorgensen's future ranch house. Laurie's red label Levis. Consider the way the Navajo-speaking Comanches decamped and re-camped in the twinkling of an eye in the final battle. These are but a few of the reasons Ethan looks so angry, perplexed and confused throughout the film...People, objects, buttes and mesas were materializing and de-materializing right before his eyes from the opening scenes. Nothing made sense.Unfortunately, Ethan's collaborations with not-yet-conceived physicist Hermann Weyl were cut by the film's editor. What was he really searching for?Exigent Ethan was 'searching' for wormholes...gates through which he could rearrange the family's tree, and his place beside Martha. What was Ethan doing during the three ""lost"" years? Studying holes. They were scattered all over the place. Scar, obviously not of Native American descent, was a pharaohic high priest of the Ancient Mysteries. Alas, Aaron's pesky adopted son kills him. It is Sca'R of Thebes who Ethan sought. He would have to find another initiate. Five years utterly wasted. Wasted! Perhaps Debbie knows...perhaps she possesses a key. She must survive.Why does Ethan turn and stumble away from the reunion in the final act? He knows something they don't, and he knows he cannot tell them.

106100,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,0790736918,Nix Pix,"[3, 4]","John Ford was a master craftsman of the American cinema. Though he dabbled in melodrama and action during his directorial career, his everlasting contribution to the movies remains in those galvanic distillations of the old west put forth by an unparalleled series of legendary films. ""The Searchers"" ranks among his most finely wrought and meticulously hand crafted projects.  Indeed it seems to be the film in which the culmination of Ford's own commitment to the power, beauty and frailty of the western frontier tragically come together in a revisionist perspective that exposes both its grandeur and its flaws. The film stars the iconic John Wayne as Ethan Edwards -  a strangely majestic antihero who vows bloody revenge after his cousin and family are slaughtered by marauding Comanches.

Though he dabbled in melodrama and action during his directorial career, his everlasting contribution to the movies remains in those galvanic distillations of the old west put forth by an unparalleled series of legendary films. &quot;The Searchers&quot; ranks among his most finely wrought and meticulously hand crafted projects. Indeed it seems to be the film in which the culmination of Ford's own commitment to the power, beauty and frailty of the western frontier tragically come together in a revisionist perspective that exposes both its grandeur and its flaws.

It is also a dark movie, showing the journey of a man coming to terms with the value of a person beyond just their experience. A John Ford/John Wayne collaboration, it is, as all Ford movies are, beautifully shot in Monument Valley, the scenery that comes to most people's minds when they think of westerns.John Wayne plays a Civil War veteran whose niece is kidnapped by  a Comanche raiding party. Wayne sets out to get her back. As time goes on, the dynamic changes from one of rescuing the niece (played by Natalie Wood) to a situation where Wayne decides the best outcome is that they find her and put her out of her misery. Yep. With an injection of lead. The kind that comes in different calibers.Wayne's determination in the face of time, arrows and lead and even threats that Woods' brother will kill him if he hurts her is incredibly cold and stoic, not necessarily the tough-guy, wise-cracking hero from his other movies. It is an amazing performance from an under-rated star.If you like westerns, you'll love this movie, and if you love movies, you'll love this movie. And you will probably want to own it, as it holds up to many repeat viewings.After this Wayne movie, you may want to try &#34;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&#34;, &#34;Red River&#34;, or &#34;The Shootist&#34;.

Let me suggest in review 166 that the viewer simply surrender to this film and let it work its extraordinary enticement. Too many of the reviews, in my opinion accurately, address the weaknesses and contradictions of the plot, the racism of Ethan, the anti-hero hero, and the weakness of a few of the episodes and of a few of the actors. I respect those assessments but feel that they miss the point; the film works at very level of involvement.Films are a deal that the audience makes with the screen: basically, we suspend judgement and wish to enter an emotional space -- comedy, mystery, whatever. The emotional space really is the movie; the film must meet the emotive test. The Searchers does this so well -- as does The Godfather, a film it has many emotive parallels with in terms of its mythic reach, its luring us to care about its bad hero, and its many character parts that create a ""reality"" -- Ford's West and Coppola's Mafia domains. It works and it continues to work after 50 years. Visually, it is a triumph, not just in its use of the landscape but of interiors with subtle lighting, bold contrasts and sharp use of depth and close ups.I personally feel that this is one of the 5-10 masterpieces of American cinema.

106111,A30I207MIU383O,0790736918,"Phillip E. Hardy ""Phillip E. Hardy""","[17, 22]","In 1955, John Ford went to Monument Valley to film what has since become his western masterpiece, ""The Searchers"". This scenic American backdrop was the perfect setting for this atmospheric story. In this film, John Wayne turns in his greatest performance as Ethan Edwards, an ex rebel soldier returning home from the Civil War under mysterious circumstances. However, his homecoming is short lived, as Reverend Samuel Clayton and his band of Texas Rangers recruit him and his adopted nephew, Martin Pawley to repel a party of Comanche Indians (Or Native Americans for the politically correct) from the neighboring ranches. Unfortunately, the raiders kill Ethan's brother and beloved sister-in-law, in addition to capturing his nieces Lucy and little Debbie. After setting out after the marauders, Ethan quickly clashes with Reverend Clayton, who questions him on his harsh tactics in fighting Comanches. In a desire to employ aggressive measures, Edwards leaves the larger group with Martin Pawley and Lucy's betrothed, Brad Jorgensen, growling, that ""he is giving the orders."" While hot on the path of the raiding party, Ethan notices that several Comanche's have split off from the trail. Urging Marty and Brad to wait, the older man goes to investigate the broken tracks of four riders. In a brilliantly acted scene, Wayne's character Ethan comes down the canyon and digs his hunting knife into the sand. Shaken to his core, the Confederate veteran has just discovered the mutilated corpse of his beautiful niece Lucy. Edwards initially keeps this grisly discovery to himself. When Marty asks the older man about his missing rebel coat, a dazed Ethan tells him that he ""has lost it."" Later that evening, the three men locate the Indian camp and Brad mistakenly believes that he sees Lucy wearing her favorite blue dress. Ethan then tells the excited young man that it is in fact a Comanche buck wearing Lucy's dress. When Brad insists he has seen Lucy, Edwards informs him that he buried her body back at the canyon, wrapped inside of his missing coat. In an act of suicidal rage, Jorgensen runs into an Indian camp to share Lucy's fate. For the next five years, Ethan and Marty myopically hunt for young Debbie, who is the captive of a Comanche chief named Scar. Along the way, Ethan manages to dispatch bushwhackers and Marty breaks up the wedding of his childhood sweetheart, in a scene brimming with comic relief. Finally, the two men rejoin Captain Clayton and his Texas Rangers to take on the Comanche's in a climatic battle, where the long-suffering Debbie is eventually rescued. For this film, the seasoned director assembled a cast of his regulars, including Ken Curtis, John Qualen, Hank Worden and Harry Carey Jr. This bunch turns in the kind of solid character acting that moviegoers came to expect from a John Ford vehicle. Ward Bond is superb as Captain Clayton and delivers some of the film's most amusing dialogue.

Ford and Wayne managed to put together a masterpiece at a time in Hollwood and the U.S.A. when a masterpiece was expected...but still treasured.My first complete viewing in 25 years, some of the idea of ""perfection"" has waned:the JW ""That'll be the day"" is too often repeated, though each time it's in a different setting and Wayne's expression is quite different; we have ""Paulie"" accidentally marrying, out on the trail with the Duke, a Native-American, who clownishly follows them, joins them in putting stakes don for the night, but is kicked away the next morning as if she is some drunken interloper. This scene could never be done per se in any imagined 2011 Searchers remake. Edwards seems to enjoy the proceedings and we wonder if that's because of racism or just general insensitivity - a follow-up scene ensures that he is at least not insensitive.At one point, Edwards and Paulie think they may have found Ethan's niece but they inspect a dwelling inhabited by ""white women"" driven insane - by a warring tribe, or *any* tribe? In '54, when the book was published, and '56 when the film was released, that was no doubt an unlikely question. Another question is whether Edwards believed, as a Confederate, that Slavery should be a State's right?The comedy is very well handled though a long passage about Paulie's original, long-waiting flame prepared to marry a simple, local dude who lucked out on the rebound,is placed just prior to the climactic action scenes involving the rescue.Viewing this exceptional picture we reflect on the movie title and it's double-meaning. Did Ethan find something more than a long-lost relative? If you will never be convinced tht John Wayne was more than a dependable character actor...see the movie. Interesting that other characters are similarly in conflict: Ward Bond must decide at different times wherher he's a Preacher or a Ranger.. And when he joins Wayne in his search, is he looking for Comanches first, or actually helping Wayne, who he knows has pocketed some ""spoils of war"" in the form of fresh, new coinage (something to help him stay on course for five years!).Sensational filmmaking (cinemtaography, editing, musical score with a beautiful theme song by The Sons Of The Pioneers, not with the historical resonance of ""High Noon"" by Tex Ritter, but a deeper lyric and more relatable to today).This VHS has a TV Special (with effusive commentary by those who were *there*) on the making of this epic plus the terrific trailor.",5,The greatest Western ever made?,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,2596,"['Multi-faceted', 'combination', 'psychological', 'drama', 'shoot', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'near-hilarious', 'comedy', 'Ford', 'Wayne', 'managed', 'put', 'together', 'masterpiece', 'time', 'Hollwood', 'U.S.A.', 'when', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'expected', 'still', 'treasured.My', 'first', 'complete', 'viewing', '25', 'years', 'idea', 'perfection', 'waned', 'JW', ""'ll"", 'be', 'day', 'too', 'often', 'repeated', 'time', 'different', 'setting', 'Wayne', 'expression', 'quite', 'different', 'have', 'Paulie', 'accidentally', 'marrying', 'trail', 'Duke', 'Native-American', 'who', 'clownishly', 'putting', 'stakes', 'don', 'night', 'kicked', 'away', 'next', 'morning', 'drunken', 'interloper', 'scene', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'se', 'imagined', '2011', 'Searchers', 'remake', 'Edwards', 'enjoy', 'proceedings', 'wonder', 'racism', 'just', 'general', 'insensitivity', 'follow-up', 'scene', 'least', 'not', 'insensitive.At', 'one', 'point', 'Edwards', 'Paulie', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'Ethan', 'niece', 'inspect', 'dwelling', 'inhabited', 'white', 'women', 'driven', 'insane', 'warring', 'tribe', '*any*', 'tribe', ""'54"", 'when', 'book', 'was', 'published', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'doubt', 'unlikely', 'question', 'question', 'Edwards', 'believed', 'Confederate', 'Slavery', 'should', 'be', 'State', 'right', 'comedy', 'very', 'well', 'handled', 'long', 'passage', 'Paulie', 'original', 'long-waiting', 'flame', 'prepared', 'marry', 'simple', 'local', 'dude', 'who', 'lucked', 'out', 'rebound', 'placed', 'just', 'prior', 'climactic', 'action', 'scenes', 'involving', 'rescue.Viewing', 'exceptional', 'picture', 'reflect', 'movie', 'title', 'double-meaning', 'Did', 'Ethan', 'find', 'something', 'more', 'long-lost', 'relative', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'convinced', 'tht', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'more', 'dependable', 'character', 'actor', 'see', 'movie', 'Interesting', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'similarly', 'conflict', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'must', 'decide', 'different', 'times', 'Preacher', 'Ranger..', 'when', 'Wayne', 'search', 'looking', 'Comanches', 'first', 'actually', 'helping', 'Wayne', 'who', 'pocketed', 'spoils', 'war', 'form', 'fresh', 'new', 'coinage', 'something', 'help', 'stay', 'course', 'five', 'years', '.Sensational', 'filmmaking', 'cinemtaography', 'editing', 'musical', 'score', 'beautiful', 'theme', 'song', 'Sons', 'Pioneers', 'not', 'historical', 'resonance', 'High', 'Noon', 'Tex', 'Ritter', 'deeper', 'lyric', 'more', 'relatable', 'today', '.This', 'VHS', 'TV', 'Special', 'effusive', 'commentary', 'who', 'were', '*there*', 'making', 'epic', 'terrific', 'trailor']",N/A

106115,AGK4BEIQ017HY,0790736918,P. I. Johnson,"[16, 31]","One of the most influential films ever made (see it and have some snobby fun drawing seemingly unlikely connections to Star Wars and Taxi Driver for example), John Ford&#8217;s The Searchers features John Wayne in his favorite and most complex role. When his brother&#8217;s family is wiped out in a Comanche raid, Indian-hating ex-Confederate soldier Ethan Edwards (Wayne) sets off on an epic, ultimately elegiac, search for his kidnapped niece Debbie (Natalie Wood), the sole survivor of the raid. Aided by Debbie&#8217;s half-Indian brother Marty (Jeffrey Hunter), Ethan&#8217;s years of searching will finally lead him to a choice between his racial hatred and his love for his niece. The Searchers is hands down one of the 3 best films in John Wayne&#8217;s legendary career as a cowboy star (the other two being Howard Hawks&#8217; Red River and Rio Bravo). The Searchers is perhaps most notable for its provocative tinkering with Wayne&#8217;s film persona &#8211; rendering him as a cruel racist (rather like the real Wayne himself) who we &#8211; like Marty &#8211; soon begin to suspect is bent on killing his niece should he discover she has &#8220;gone Indian&#8221;. Yet, it is undoubtedly also a technically superb genre work of great directorial craftsmanship with surprisingly grand themes carefully explored in a manner that makes it positively Shakespearean. Featuring stunning signature shots of Ford&#8217;s beloved Monument Valley, The Searchers is ultimately the classic tale of a closing frontier and a man&#8217;s reluctant realization that time and progress have begun to render him and his value system obsolete. Yet, for all its intended genre irony it is nevertheless slightly awkward to wholly and uncritically embrace The Searchers, particularly because one is never quite sure whether the film itself &#8211; despite its self-effacement - revels in the mindlessly cruel treatment meted out by Ethan to Indians. The scene &#8211; unacceptably played for laughs &#8211; in which Ethan and Marty violently assault Marty&#8217;s squaw wife (forced on him by her chief father) is particularly distasteful. Critics will well counter with a number of scenes in which the distance between Ethan&#8217;s extremist character and the closing frontier society around him is emphasized. This would include the scene in which the Reverend questions his cruelty and blind hatred, as well as the famous pathos-tinged, door-frame ending.... And perhaps fans may also point to his grudging warming to his half-breed nephew and eventual decisive encounter with Natalie Wood as something approaching satisfactory redemption. This may well be applicable to the Ethan character, but hardly addresses the issue of the film&#8217;s overall and problematic point of view. It&#8217;s a rather pointless effort to willfully wish away the film&#8217;s racism &#8211; something that even otherwise astute critics have been guilty of. The best example of this unfortunate trend is perhaps Peter Bogdanovich&#8217;s sycophantic leading comment &#8220;The Indians are always given great dignity in your films&#8221; when interviewing Ford on The Searchers in his famous 1968 interviews with the ageing director. Great dignity? The Searchers? What film was Bogdanovich watching? Even Ford himself showed a better awareness of his dubious portrayal of Indians, specifically intending his genuinely dignifying portrayal in his under-appreciated Cheyenne Autumn (1964) to be an antidote to their portrayal in his earlier Westerns. The Searchers is a great movie done no favors by unnecessarily pretending that it is not also politically problematic.

From the opening shot, a door being open and through it seeing the wide, open red desert, you know you're in for an old school western treat. I first saw this film not that long ago, probably around Christmas, 2010. It was AMC, and I decided to sit down with a pizza in the freezing cold and watch it. I was, to say the least, AMAZED. At sixteen, I'd never really seen a John Wayne film, as sad as that is, its true. My dad's always been a huge fan, but I was never able to get into the old westerns, that is, until I saw this one. Wayne's performance as the bigoted Ethan reminded me so much of the people I'd see and meet, hard shelled, soft centered. A real anti-hero, and a fabulous performance. I live in California by the way, Central Valley, Nor Cal, and what I mean by him reminding me of people I know if, is well, some of my fellow Caucasians are well-meaning morons, I've been around many that just constantly insult the Hispanic population around here, which just makes them dislike us in general even more, a vicious cycle if there ever was one. Anyway, I could relate to the young character of Martin, perhaps the moral character of the story, trying to hold back the old ways, trying to keep justice from becoming in-justice, just faced in the opposite direction. The characters all seem so real, even after fifty years, and many changes in the styles of film acting, John Wayne still holds his ground for me. And I have, yes, grown to love many a John Wayne film, from Rio Bravo to The Sons of Katie Elder, is, most definitely, in my top twenty favorite actors. The story itself revolves around Ethan and Martin trying for over ten years to find a girl who was kidnapped by a group of Comanche, who also slaughtered and raped the girls parents and siblings. The real greatness of this film is the interactions between Wayne and Jeffery Hunter(Martin), and how, at the end of the film, Wayne's character, Ethan, does change into a better, less bigoted and prejudiced man. The only thing that I could see from the film that could have been better, or perhaps just enhanced the film, would be the final act, I felt like it ended too quickly and happily, though I think it DOES work, I almost do wish that it ended more grimly, and that the film had more of the somber elements that are found through out, but, as it lies, it is a grand and wonderful film.",5,"""As Sure as the Turnin' of the Earth...""",1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,2481,"['John', 'Wayne', 'duke', 'really', 'should', 'say', 'probably', 'wont', 'fly', ""'ll"", 'pontificate', 'further', 'opening', 'shot', 'door', 'being', 'open', 'seeing', 'wide', 'open', 'red', 'desert', 'know', ""'re"", 'old', 'school', 'western', 'treat', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'probably', 'Christmas', '2010', 'was', 'AMC', 'decided', 'sit', 'down', 'pizza', 'freezing', 'cold', 'watch', 'was', 'say', 'least', 'AMAZED', 'sixteen', ""'d"", 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film', 'as', 'sad', 'true', 'dad', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'get', 'old', 'westerns', 'saw', 'one', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'bigoted', 'Ethan', 'reminded', 'so', 'much', 'people', ""'d"", 'see', 'meet', 'hard', 'shelled', 'soft', 'centered', 'real', 'anti-hero', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'live', 'California', 'way', 'Central', 'Valley', 'Nor', 'Cal', 'what', 'mean', 'reminding', 'people', 'know', 'well', 'fellow', 'Caucasians', 'are', 'well-meaning', 'morons', ""'ve"", 'been', 'around', 'many', 'just', 'constantly', 'insult', 'Hispanic', 'population', 'here', 'just', 'dislike', 'general', 'even', 'more', 'vicious', 'cycle', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Anyway', 'could', 'relate', 'young', 'character', 'Martin', 'perhaps', 'moral', 'character', 'story', 'trying', 'hold', 'back', 'old', 'ways', 'trying', 'keep', 'justice', 'becoming', 'in-justice', 'just', 'faced', 'opposite', 'direction', 'characters', 'seem', 'so', 'real', 'even', 'fifty', 'years', 'many', 'changes', 'styles', 'film', 'acting', 'John', 'Wayne', 'still', 'ground', 'have', 'yes', 'grown', 'love', 'many', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'Sons', 'Katie', 'Elder', 'most', 'definitely', 'top', 'twenty', 'favorite', 'actors', 'story', 'around', 'Ethan', 'Martin', 'trying', 'ten', 'years', 'find', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'group', 'Comanche', 'who', 'also', 'slaughtered', 'raped', 'girls', 'parents', 'siblings', 'real', 'greatness', 'film', 'interactions', 'Wayne', 'Jeffery', 'Hunter', 'Martin', 'how', 'end', 'film', 'Wayne', 'character', 'Ethan', 'change', 'better', 'less', 'bigoted', 'prejudiced', 'man', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'see', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'perhaps', 'just', 'enhanced', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'act', 'felt', 'ended', 'too', 'quickly', 'happily', 'think', 'DOES', 'work', 'almost', 'do', 'wish', 'ended', 'more', 'grimly', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'somber', 'elements', 'are', 'found', 'out', 'grand', 'wonderful', 'film']",N/A

106120,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,0790736918,Randy Keehn,"[3, 4]","I first saw this movie a time or two when I was a young man.  I didn't really understand why it was so highly thought of until I had read a biography or two of John Ford.  When I got a chance to see it later, I found myself seeing many subtle facets of what I had previously thought to a slow-moving action Western.  You see, this is NOT an action movie.  The fact that there are some gunfights throughout the movie probably mislead me thinking that it was about action.  It is about obsession instead: the obsession of a man to save his niece from what he felt was a fate worse than death.Ethan Edwards comes back from the Civil War and seems to be hiding a dark secret.  He visits his brother's familiy and, while there, they are attacked by Indians.  When Ethan returns to the site of the massacre of his brother's family, he realizes that the two daughters are missing.  They had been captured by the Comanches and Ethan sets out with others to search for them.  Time and distance causes most to drop out of the search and return to their own homes but Ethan continues his search over the course of a couple of years.  He has a couple of young men along to help out but it is Ethan who leads the way doggedly.As in most Ford movies, there is a community that is central to the understanding that individuals and actions are best understood in relationship to the society they come from.  Sometimes, we don't share Ford's sense of purpose along these lines because we're more drawn towards Ethan Edwards sense of purpose.  As a result, some scenes slow down the drama (as well as the action).  The film culminates in returning to society.  Edwards hasn't fit into society since he went off to war.  Now that his task is over, society has no use for him and no place for him as well.  In an unforgetable closing scene, Edwards knows that it's time for him to leave.There are many unforgetable scenes in ""The Searchers"" in addition to the closing one.  The scene in which Edwards has to break the truth to Brad Jorgenson is about the best scene John Wayne ever did (and he's had a lot of memorable scenes over his career).  The team of Ford and Wayne has produced some of the best in American cinema over the years.  Other than ""Donovan's Reef"" I can't think of a single failure but there are plenty of classic; ""Stagecoach"", ""The Quiet Man"", ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"" to name a few.  These two men, along with Ford's standard stock players, have given us a story of how society needs men of uncommon strength to do the hard work in society's crises.  Yet, when the work is done, society often forgets and looks the other way.  Whether this was an allegory about the returning veterans or just a story about the special breed of man it took to win the West, it is a compelling study of a man with a mission.  Although it suffered from the accepted attitudes towards the Indians in the Western conquest, it is a story that continues to be impressive.  Just don't think of it as an action Western.",5,What Makes a Man to Wander?,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,3005,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'time', 'two', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'highly', 'thought', 'had', 'read', 'biography', 'two', 'John', 'Ford', 'When', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'later', 'found', 'seeing', 'many', 'subtle', 'facets', 'what', 'had', 'previously', 'thought', 'slow-moving', 'action', 'Western', 'see', 'NOT', 'action', 'movie', 'fact', 'are', 'gunfights', 'movie', 'probably', 'mislead', 'thinking', 'was', 'action', 'obsession', 'instead', 'obsession', 'man', 'save', 'niece', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'fate', 'worse', 'death.Ethan', 'Edwards', 'back', 'Civil', 'War', 'be', 'hiding', 'dark', 'secret', 'brother', 'familiy', 'there', 'are', 'attacked', 'Indians', 'When', 'Ethan', 'site', 'massacre', 'brother', 'family', 'two', 'daughters', 'are', 'missing', 'had', 'been', 'captured', 'Comanches', 'Ethan', 'out', 'others', 'search', 'Time', 'distance', 'causes', 'most', 'drop', 'search', 'return', 'own', 'homes', 'Ethan', 'search', 'course', 'couple', 'years', 'couple', 'young', 'men', 'help', 'out', 'Ethan', 'who', 'way', 'doggedly.As', 'most', 'Ford', 'movies', 'community', 'central', 'understanding', 'individuals', 'actions', 'are', 'best', 'understood', 'relationship', 'society', 'come', 'Sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'Ford', 'sense', 'purpose', 'lines', ""'re"", 'more', 'drawn', 'towards', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'sense', 'purpose', 'result', 'scenes', 'slow', 'down', 'drama', 'as', 'well', 'action', 'film', 'culminates', 'returning', 'society', 'Edwards', ""n't"", 'fit', 'society', 'went', 'war', 'Now', 'task', 'society', 'use', 'place', 'as', 'well', 'unforgetable', 'closing', 'scene', 'Edwards', 'time', 'are', 'many', 'unforgetable', 'scenes', 'Searchers', 'addition', 'closing', 'one', 'scene', 'Edwards', 'break', 'truth', 'Brad', 'Jorgenson', 'best', 'scene', 'John', 'Wayne', 'ever', 'did', 'had', 'lot', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'career', 'team', 'Ford', 'Wayne', 'produced', 'best', 'American', 'cinema', 'years', 'Other', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'failure', 'are', 'plenty', 'classic', 'Stagecoach', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Man', 'Who', 'Shot', 'Liberty', 'Valence', 'name', 'few', 'two', 'men', 'Ford', 'standard', 'stock', 'players', 'have', 'given', 'story', 'how', 'society', 'men', 'uncommon', 'strength', 'do', 'hard', 'work', 'society', 'crises', 'when', 'work', 'done', 'society', 'often', 'other', 'way', 'was', 'allegory', 'returning', 'veterans', 'just', 'story', 'special', 'breed', 'man', 'took', 'win', 'West', 'compelling', 'study', 'man', 'mission', 'suffered', 'accepted', 'attitudes', 'Indians', 'Western', 'conquest', 'story', 'be', 'impressive', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'action', 'Western']",N/A

A Rubin,"[5, 6]","Now considered the greatest American Film, yes, greater than Citizen Kane, The Searchers was always a John Wayne-John Ford favorite, but lately the critics have chimed in. Ford records once again and for all time his actors in the backdrop of an unreal place, Monument Valley. The jutting rocks placed before the camera as if an Ansel Adams photograph excites the eye.  There's much to be said for a good shoot site.  This one is the best of all time.  The framed shots from within The Edwards cabin, a photo of Wayne coming and going as the lonely American without connection to his family, a beautiful allegory in cinema.Made in 1955 from a book by Alan Le May, essentially this is a story of tribal hatred.  The white settlers and the Comanche battle it out for the land and the women. The racial insanity, still potent in the mid-50's after two hundred years of murderous strife has hit the wall.  Ethan as played by Wayne, the stereotypical Ford, Western hero, except for one flaw: Ethan is a racist.  The Indian raid on his family, the rape of his niece and the kidnapping of Debbie Edwards, played by Natalie Wood as an adult (her younger sister played the child) send Ethan on a trek of revenge. Young Martin Pawley played by Jeffrey Hunter searches for Debbie also, but only to keep his adopted uncle from murdering her.  Ethan wants do an honor killing because the Comanche Chief, Sky will have bedded her by the time she's a woman.  The search goes on episodically all over the Southwest for five years and Debbie is indeed a woman in Sky's tepee.The reuniting of lovers and the return of Debbie to a tranquil America of love and tolerance envelopes all but one in the curious ending.  Only Ethan is alone in the doorway with the rock sculptures of Monument Valley.One last note: I know cosmetics were important to 1950's sensibilities.  The false eyelashes and ruby red lips of Natalie Wood playing a white- woman turned Comanche and her tight fitting Indian dress, distracted from an otherwise well researched make-up and costuming.",5,Better Than Citzen Kane,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,2045,"['Now', 'considered', 'greatest', 'American', 'Film', 'yes', 'greater', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Searchers', 'was', 'always', 'John', 'Wayne-John', 'Ford', 'favorite', 'lately', 'critics', 'have', 'chimed', 'Ford', 'once', 'again', 'time', 'actors', 'backdrop', 'unreal', 'place', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'jutting', 'rocks', 'placed', 'camera', 'Ansel', 'Adams', 'photograph', 'eye', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'good', 'shoot', 'site', 'one', 'best', 'time', 'framed', 'shots', 'Edwards', 'cabin', 'photo', 'Wayne', 'coming', 'going', 'lonely', 'American', 'connection', 'family', 'beautiful', 'allegory', 'cinema.Made', '1955', 'book', 'Alan', 'Le', 'May', 'essentially', 'story', 'tribal', 'hatred', 'white', 'settlers', 'Comanche', 'battle', 'out', 'land', 'women', 'racial', 'insanity', 'still', 'potent', 'mid-50', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'murderous', 'strife', 'hit', 'wall', 'Ethan', 'played', 'Wayne', 'stereotypical', 'Ford', 'Western', 'hero', 'one', 'flaw', 'Ethan', 'racist', 'Indian', 'raid', 'family', 'rape', 'niece', 'kidnapping', 'Debbie', 'Edwards', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'adult', 'younger', 'sister', 'played', 'child', 'send', 'Ethan', 'trek', 'revenge', 'Young', 'Martin', 'Pawley', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'searches', 'Debbie', 'also', 'only', 'keep', 'adopted', 'uncle', 'murdering', 'Ethan', 'do', 'honor', 'killing', 'Comanche', 'Chief', 'Sky', 'will', 'have', 'bedded', 'time', 'woman', 'search', 'episodically', 'Southwest', 'five', 'years', 'Debbie', 'indeed', 'woman', 'Sky', 'tepee.The', 'reuniting', 'lovers', 'return', 'Debbie', 'tranquil', 'America', 'love', 'tolerance', 'envelopes', 'one', 'curious', 'ending', 'Only', 'Ethan', 'alone', 'doorway', 'rock', 'sculptures', 'Monument', 'Valley.One', 'last', 'note', 'know', 'cosmetics', 'were', 'important', '1950', 'sensibilities', 'false', 'eyelashes', 'ruby', 'red', 'lips', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'playing', 'white-', 'woman', 'turned', 'Comanche', 'tight', 'fitting', 'Indian', 'dress', 'distracted', 'otherwise', 'well', 'researched', 'make-up', 'costuming']",N/A

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[0, 0]","From the opening frame where the door to the frontier cabin opens to a breathtaking vista of Monument Valley, to the final frame with John Wayne walking away from the closing cabin door, this is a perfect Western. It has been ranked as the #1 Western by AFI and I would personally rank it #2 behind &#34;High Noon&#34;. It is John Wayne's best performance - the Oscar for &#34;True Grit&#34; notwithstanding - and it is John Ford's best Western, among many great ones. Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards, is conflicted between his racial prejudice and hatred of Native Americans and the family ties that bind him to the young girl the Comanche's have kidnapped. Wayne pulls that off...this is not just Wayne playing Wayne; he performs brilliantly. Ford's treatment of racial prejudice and genocide was innovative for the time and startling in its harshness. Ford commented in an interview that &#34;if he (the Indian) has been treated unfairly by whites in films, that. unfortunately was the case in real life. There was a lot of prejudice in the West.&#34; In addition to Wayne, the casting is universally outstanding...the only minor exception is the casting of the German-American, Henry Brandon, as the Comanche chief, Scar...a Native American actor would have been better. Co-star, Jeffrey Hunter, playing, Martin Pawley, is as good here as I've ever seen him. Same is true for Ward Bond, playing a Texas Ranger captain and preacher; Hank Worden as the cerebrally challenged, Mose Harper; and Ken Curtis as Charlie McCorry. One of my favorite lines from the film is Curtis stating in his best Festus Hagen drawl...&#34;I'll thank you to unhand my fiance!&#34; Curtis also sings while courting Vera Miles...many don't know he was an original member of the &#34;Sons of the Pioneers&#34;.

106139,A2SEGL7DRURZHE,0790736918,Robert Beck,"[2, 2]","Monument Valley never looked better in VistaVision's three strip filming process.  Roger Ebert stated, ""John Ford's ''The Searchers'' contains scenes of magnificence, and one of John Wayne's best performances. There are shots that are astonishingly beautiful.""  The only Western in history to be placed in the top 10 Sight & Sound Poll as among the greatest films of all time.  AFI ranked The Searchers #12 in their all-time list and in 1989 the United States National Film Registry's first year of selecting films for preservation, chose The Searchers as one of the first 25 films to be deemed ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.""  The Searchers has influenced films as diverse as Star Wars, Taxi Driver, Hardcore, Dances with Wolves, Saving Private Ryan, The Wind and the Lion and Apocalypse Now.  David Lean studied The Searchers in preparation for Lawrence of Arabia and as a result movie history was made with that famous shot of the across-the-desert entrance of Sherif Ali.  Sergio Leone listed The Searchers as one of his favorite films.  Much has been made of the film's racist overtones, but both sides were equally represented and based on historical fact.  The basis of Ethan Edward's obsession is clearly stated when Debbie hides next to a tombstone that states the massacre of Ethan's mother at the beginning of the film.  Not so obvious is John Ford's hidden subtext about Ethan's affair with his brother's wife and that Lucy or Debbie could possibly be Ethan's children.  The thirst for vengeance makes total sense especially with the prospect that Debbie's been ""living with a Buck.""  So many great scenes (the wedding scene, the letter reading scene) and lots of comic relief (""That'll be the day!""), keep the viewer's interest throughout.  As far as I'm concerned, this is John Wayne's greatest acting triumph.  When Ethan has to explain to Brad that Lucy was dead and he says, ""What do you want me to do? Draw you a picture? Spell it out? Don't ever ask me! Long as you live, don't ever ask me more,"" is delivered with such harrowing conviction by Wayne, it gives me goose bumps.  Then there is the scene when Ethan sees two white women who were raped by Indians and regressed to their childhood, Ethan says, ""They aren't white. Not anymore.""  As Ethan exits we are given one of the greatest close-ups in movie history (seen over and over again in motion picture retrospectives).  John Ford was sparse with camera movements and so when he employs camera movements, there is a heightened sense of drama.  Ford's camera rapidly tracks in on Wayne's face to that close-up and reveals Ethan's total contempt--a chilling moment.  Every shot is framed.  I've never seen a movie that did this so effectively and with such beauty.  It's like Frederic Remington painted each shot.  Keep in mind, this is all before CGI.  The cinematography is stunning.  Then there is that incredible final shot, perfectly framed again with awesome cinematography and John Wayne's personal tribute to Harry Carey.  I am in awe every time I watch this movie.",5,Amazing movie!!!,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,3071,"['Monument', 'Valley', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'VistaVision', 'three', 'strip', 'filming', 'process', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'stated', 'John', 'Ford', 'Searchers', 'scenes', 'magnificence', 'one', 'John', 'Wayne', 'best', 'performances', 'are', 'shots', 'are', 'astonishingly', 'beautiful', 'only', 'Western', 'history', 'be', 'placed', 'top', '10', 'Sight', 'Sound', 'Poll', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'AFI', 'ranked', 'Searchers', '12', 'all-time', 'list', '1989', 'United', 'States', 'National', 'Film', 'Registry', 'first', 'year', 'selecting', 'films', 'preservation', 'chose', 'Searchers', 'one', 'first', '25', 'films', 'be', 'deemed', 'culturally', 'historically', 'aesthetically', 'significant', 'Searchers', 'influenced', 'films', 'as', 'diverse', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Hardcore', 'Wolves', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Wind', 'Lion', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'David', 'Lean', 'studied', 'Searchers', 'preparation', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'result', 'movie', 'history', 'was', 'made', 'famous', 'shot', 'across-the-desert', 'entrance', 'Sherif', 'Ali', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'listed', 'Searchers', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'film', 'racist', 'overtones', 'sides', 'were', 'equally', 'represented', 'based', 'historical', 'fact', 'basis', 'Ethan', 'Edward', 'obsession', 'clearly', 'stated', 'when', 'Debbie', 'next', 'tombstone', 'massacre', 'Ethan', 'mother', 'beginning', 'film', 'Not', 'so', 'obvious', 'John', 'Ford', 'hidden', 'subtext', 'Ethan', 'affair', 'brother', 'wife', 'Lucy', 'Debbie', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'Ethan', 'children', 'thirst', 'vengeance', 'total', 'sense', 'especially', 'prospect', 'Debbie', 'been', 'living', 'Buck', 'So', 'many', 'great', 'scenes', 'wedding', 'scene', 'letter', 'reading', 'scene', 'lots', 'comic', 'relief', ""'ll"", 'be', 'day', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interest', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'John', 'Wayne', 'greatest', 'acting', 'triumph', 'When', 'Ethan', 'explain', 'Brad', 'Lucy', 'was', 'dead', 'What', 'do', 'want', 'do', 'Draw', 'picture', 'Spell', 'out', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'ask', 'Long', 'live', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'ask', 'more', 'delivered', 'such', 'harrowing', 'conviction', 'Wayne', 'goose', 'bumps', 'Then', 'scene', 'when', 'Ethan', 'two', 'white', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'raped', 'Indians', 'regressed', 'childhood', 'Ethan', 'are', ""n't"", 'white', 'Not', 'anymore', 'Ethan', 'are', 'given', 'one', 'greatest', 'close-ups', 'movie', 'history', 'seen', 'over', 'again', 'motion', 'picture', 'John', 'Ford', 'was', 'sparse', 'camera', 'movements', 'so', 'when', 'camera', 'movements', 'heightened', 'sense', 'drama', 'Ford', 'camera', 'rapidly', 'Wayne', 'face', 'close-up', 'reveals', 'Ethan', 'total', 'contempt', 'chilling', 'moment', 'shot', 'framed', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'did', 'so', 'effectively', 'such', 'beauty', 'Frederic', 'Remington', 'painted', 'shot', 'Keep', 'mind', 'CGI', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'Then', 'incredible', 'final', 'shot', 'perfectly', 'framed', 'again', 'awesome', 'cinematography', 'John', 'Wayne', 'personal', 'tribute', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'am', 'awe', 'time', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A
106140,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0790736918,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[15, 26]","The Searchers (John Ford, 1956)It seems to be the consensus among reviewers that the climax of The Searchers says something about Ethan Edwards that I don't see. In order to address that, this review is going to be laden with spoilers; if you haven't seen the movie yet and plan to, stop reading. There is no way for me to express my deep dissatisfaction with this film without talking about it, so I'm going to.The story: Ethan Edwards (John Wayne), a somewhat mysterious figure, turns up at the house of his brother Aaron (Walter Coy) and sister-in-law Martha (Dorothy Jordan). Ford wastes no time in getting us understanding that this is not the John Wayne we know and love; he harbors feelings for his sister-in-law, he seems to still be fighting the Civil War, and, in what may be the most quoted line from the film (at least in the reviews I've read of it), the local law says Ethan ""fits a lot of descriptions"". Welcome, antihero. Ethan is not at all a likable man; aside from (probably) being lawless, he's also an inveterate racist who hates Indians so much that he shuns he nephew Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) for being one-eighth Comanche-- this despite Ethan, as a child, having saved Martin from the attack that killed his family, and having left Martin with Aaron and Martha to raise when Ethan went off to war. Things get worse when, while Ethan and Martin are out pursuing a band of Cherokee raiders, those same raiders turn back and massacre Aaron and his family, with the exception of youngest daughter Debbie (played as a young woman by Natalie Wood), whom they kidnap. After a few days, the search party gives up; Ethan is determined to continue on alone, but Martin insists on going with him. Eventually, Martin stays on the trail with him not only to help him search, but because he's afraid that Ethan's hatred of the Comanche may also visit itself on Debbie.The crux of the film, obviously, is Ethan's racism. (To play devil's advocate, he does have some reason-- early in the film, it's revealed that Comanches killed Ethan's mother-- yet even this is undercut by a statement in the film, mentioned in passing, that there are many different bands of Comanche.) Much is made of the fact that Ethan, once Debbie's situation is fully revealed, considers Debbie alternately as a Comanche herself or, when he thinks of her as white, as ""a Comanche buck's squaw""; the inference is obvious (and, in the fifties, when miscegenation was still illegal in many parts of the country, probably resounded with audiences). So what is it that happens in that climax? Is Ethan's decision to rescue Debbie instead of killing her indicative of a change of heart? Even Martin doesn't see it coming; when he loses track of Ethan in the big battle, his first priority is tracking Ethan down and protecting Debbie from him. Right up to the bitter end, Ethan has traded on his hatred of Indians. This ""change of heart"" comes out of the blue, and with the information we're given, it's roughly as believable as a flock of purple elephants charging in to save the day. Even worse, there's no evidence offered after the fact that Ethan has had a change of heart; the movie ends very soon after.There is no doubt, however, that both Ford and cinematographer Winton Hoch were consummate filmmakers. The movie has the same striking look of most of Ford's films; all this nastiness is quite beautifully, if starkly, presented. Insert commentary here on the landscape reflecting Ethan's outlook on things; it's dry, sparsely-furnished, almost entirely barren of life. Even the band of Comanche Ethan and Martin are tracking down are nomads; nothing can survive on that plain for a long period of time; that way lies madness (cf. Sjostrom's The Wind). From a purely technical point of view, this is, in fact, a great achievement in American film history, and I understand why so many people seem so anxious to make sure it stays well within the lists of the all-time great films. As well, it has been remarkably influential, with its basic plot cropping up in everything from Taxi Driver to Star Wars, and crossing media to furnish Buddy Holly with one of his most famous songs (""That'll be the Day"", inspired by Ethan's repeated use of the phrase). And yet, despite all this, I can't get past such a basic deficiency in the script.As well, as Roger Ebert points out in his review, this does seem like two different films that were cobbled together; there's the obsessive, bleak movie about Ethan Edwards' tracking down the Comanche, and then there's a comedy/musical flick that seems to have gotten tossed in somewhere along the way, with a subplot involving Martin's fianc&eacute;e Laurie Jorgensen (Vera Miles) and her scatterbrained family. The pieces of the two plots don't quite fit together, and what emerges from the cracks is a rather foul odor of decay. It has been opined in more than one review I've read that the comedic portions of the film may have been added in order to lighten the depressing main plot; problem is they just didn't mix in well, and this souffle ended up falling before it ever got out of the oven.An incredibly difficult film to rate, with some parts of it being so striking and others being so bad. Ultimately, I ended up looking more at the bad side, as I can't see myself watching this movie again any time soon. **",2,Maybe the toughest film I've ever had to rate; an amazing movie saddled with an offensive script.,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,5346,"['Searchers', 'John', 'Ford', '1956', 'be', 'consensus', 'reviewers', 'climax', 'Searchers', 'something', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'do', ""n't"",

106141,A1MD6MXBHCRC0V,0790736918,Robert J. Evered,"[6, 7]","I first saw this film as a young eighteen year-old Western aficionado on its first theatrical release to the English provinces in 1956. I came to it with great expectations fresh from reading Alan Le May's book of the same name. I came away knowing I'd seen a great film but I was disappointed on two counts first the search lasts for ten years in the book and second, Wayne's character Ethan is killed off in the penultimate battle with the Indians. In the subsequent years I've seen this film dozens of times and it never fails to amaze me that on each fresh viewing I never fail to notice something new!John Ford and John Wayne collaborated on several films most of them westerns. Although this was their first Western for six years since they completed the last of the Cavalry Trilogy RIO GRANDE (1950). As with the trilogy, Ford once again choose to shoot the most of the film in Monument Valley Utah, when using this his favourite location Ford became an acclaimed visual poet of the West. With Ford's ""Western Director"" to Wayne's ""Western Star"" they were unequalled in the making of Westerns producing an outstanding body of work between 1939 and 1962! Although THE SEARCHERS remained totally unrecognised by The Academy Awards for 1956. Fifty-odd years later it still stands at the top of the many peoples list as the greatest Western of all time. Also appearing in most if not all of The Greatest 100 Movies Of All Time Lists.Three years after the Civil War Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) a dark brooding mysterious character returns home to his brother Aaron (Walter Coy) homestead.  Ethan takes his brother place on a posse led by Texas Ranger Rev. Capt. Samuel Johnston Clayton (Ward Bond) on the trail of a raiding party, coming across some slaughtered cattle they realise they've been lured away whilst the main Indian party attacked either the Edwards or Jorgensen Homesteads.The main body of the posse head back towards Jorgensen's place whilst Ethan along with Mose Harper (Hank Worden) rest their horses before heading back to the Edwards homestead, meanwhile Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) who had raised by the Edwards as their own raced on ahead against Ethan's advice. Arriving back at the smoking Edwards homestead their worse fears are founded, the two girls Lucy (Pippa Scott) and young Debbie (Lana Wood) have been taken captive and the rest killed. After the burial of his family a demented Ethan sets out after the Indians with a posse led by Captain Clayton. Following a skirmish with the Indians at the river, Clayton elects to take the wounded back home.Ethan reckons on going on alone but Martin and Brad Jorgensen (Harry Carey Jr.) insist on going too, not least because they fear what Ethan might do the girls.  So the three (later two) searchers set out on the trail of the Indians for five long years a couple of trips back to the Jorgensen homestead when the trail was lost and twice pointed in the right direction by Shakespearian Fool Mose Harper, that leads to a band of Comanche led by a chief called Scar (Henry Brandon). At the camp they discover the older Debbie (Natalie Wood) dressed as an Indian girl of marriageable age. Will Ethan carry out his threat to kill her or will Martin be able to stop him?John Ford was the master of conveying terrible events to his audience through suggested violence, like the returning posse coming across the burnt out homestead with Martha's dress laying on the ground outside indicating the horrors that lay inside. Again when Ethan returns to Martin and Brad from finding Lucy's remains we just see the haunted look on his face as he plunges his knife in the earth to remove the Indian blood from the blade, all powerful stuff but left to our own imagination!And not only suggested violence but also suggested love too, hardly a word pass between Ethan and Martha but the viewer is left with little doubt of a passed tender relationship between the two. The long narrative is held together by a couple of visits back to the Jorgensen Homestead and a letter from Martin to Laurie, read out to one and all! Ford's ending of the film has turned out in the end to be one of the most iconic endings in movie history. How could I have been so presumptuous as to think anything else?This Two-Disc Special Edition includes new digital transfer from restored Vista Vision Picture with an introduction by Co-Star Patrick Wayne.

106145,A16QODENBJVUI1,0790736918,Robert Moore,"[4, 5]","There are moments in this film that are just about as perfect as anything as you will find in cinema, moments that display John Ford functioning at his highest level as a filmmaker.  For instance, there is a precious moment in which a woman is affectionately stroking the coat of her brother-in-law, who has just turned up after a long absence.  She is unaware that someone else, played by Ward Bond, can and at first does see her.  But the moment is far too personal, and Bond resolutely averts his eyes and refuses to see what ought not to be seen by anyone.  Another such instance is the final shot of the film (which I can't describe in detail without giving away the plot).  As the family retreats into the house, another character is framed outside the house (as if to exclude him), isolated from the family.  It is a heartbreaking shot.  The shot was also a homage to the late Harry Carey, in that the character in the frame holds his arm across his chest to hold the top of his opposite arm above the elbow, a gesture that anyone from that time period would associate with Carey.This great John Ford film comes very close to being the greatest Western ever made.  In fact, with two slight alterations, it almost certainly would have been.  For some reason, Ford in some of his films suffered from unaccountable lapses in casting.  In this one, in the crucial role of Martin Pawley, he cast Jeffrey Hunter.  In many ways, Hunter mars the film with his often-grating performance.  One can only lament what the film could have been with someone like Montgomery Cliff in the same role.  The other odd decision was the elevation of Ken Curtis's role as Vera Miles other suitor.  Curtis, a former big band crooner who was later best known as ""Festus"" on GUNSMOKE, has several scenes that tend to bring down the overall quality of the film, especially a fight scene at a wedding with Jeffrey Hunter.But these are aberrations in what is otherwise a masterpiece of the highest order.  I am not a big John Wayne fan, but Wayne was not just never better than he was in this film:  it is impossible to imagine anyone playing the central role of Ethan Edwards better than Wayne does.  He brings a grimness and tenacity and monomania that gives the movie much of its force and tension.  And although Hunter and Curtis both mar the film, most of the cast is spectacular.  Sometimes it seems as if Ward Bond were in every other film made in the thirties, forties, and fifties, but he was never better than he was in the role of Reverend Captain Samuel Johnson Clayton, both minister and police depending upon the need at the time.  And Hank Worden is memorable as ""Old Mose,"" the more than a little crazed old fool who provides some of the films more memorable moments.  For instance, with the Rangers entrenched on one side of a river, bracing to meet an onrushing group of Indians, Mose suddenly shouts out, ""Oh Lord, for what we are about to receive, we thank thee.""They key to the film, however, apart from Ford, lies in the performance of John Wayne.  This is not the simplistic Indian killer or fighter you see in most of Wayne's films.  In this one, he is a man who has seen and suffered too much.  Ironically, he is chasing a rogue Indian chief named Scar, so-called because of a scar running down the side of his face.  But Ethan is far more scarred than the Indian is.  And as his hunt for Debbie, who has been abducted by Indians, turns from weeks into months into years, he correspondingly becomes more and more obsessed, to the point of near insanity.  Indeed, much of the tension of the last part of the film comes from the distrust of Ethan's sanity on the part of Martin (Jeffrey Hunter).  The scene where Ethan finally determines the fate of Debbie is one of the great moments in cinema.This is just a great film by one of the great masters of the American cinema with the greatest performance by one of our most famous stars.  If that isn't enough to make someone unfamiliar with this film to see it, I don't know what would be.",5,Easily one of the great Westerns ever made,1025913600,"07 6, 2002",2002,4038,"['are', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'perfect', 'anything', 'will', 'find', 'cinema', 'moments', 'display', 'John', 'Ford', 'functioning', 'highest', 'level', 'filmmaker', 'instance', 'precious', 'moment', 'woman', 'affectionately', 'stroking', 'coat', 'brother-in-law', 'who', 'just', 'turned', 'up', 'long', 'absence', 'unaware', 'someone', 'else', 'played', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'can', 'first', 'see', 'moment', 'far', 'too', 'personal', 'Bond', 'resolutely', 'eyes', 'see', 'what', 'ought', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'anyone', 'such', 'instance', 'final', 'shot', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'detail', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'family', 'house', 'character', 'framed', 'house', 'exclude', 'isolated', 'family', 'heartbreaking', 'shot', 'shot', 'was', 'also', 'homage', 'late', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'character', 'frame', 'arm', 'chest', 'hold', 'top', 'opposite', 'arm', 'elbow', 'gesture', 'anyone', 'time', 'period', 'would', 'associate', 'Carey.This', 'great', 'John', 'Ford', 'film', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'greatest', 'Western', 'ever', 'made', 'fact', 'two', 'slight', 'alterations', 'almost', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'reason', 'Ford', 'films', 'suffered', 'unaccountable', 'lapses', 'casting', 'one', 'crucial', 'role', 'Martin', 'Pawley', 'cast', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'many', 'ways', 'Hunter', 'film', 'often-grating', 'performance', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'lament', 'what', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'Montgomery', 'Cliff', 'same', 'role', 'other', 'odd', 'decision', 'was', 'elevation', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'role', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'other', 'suitor', 'Curtis', 'former', 'big', 'band', 'crooner', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'best', 'known', 'Festus', 'GUNSMOKE', 'several', 'scenes', 'tend', 'bring', 'down', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'especially', 'fight', 'scene', 'wedding', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter.But', 'are', 'aberrations', 'what', 'otherwise', 'masterpiece', 'highest', 'order', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fan', 'Wayne', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'never', 'better', 'was', 'film', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'playing', 'central', 'role', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'better', 'Wayne', 'grimness', 'tenacity', 'monomania', 'movie', 'much', 'force', 'tension', 'Hunter', 'Curtis', 'mar', 'film', 'most', 'cast', 'spectacular', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'were', 'other', 'film', 'made', 'thirties', 'forties', 'fifties', 'was', 'never', 'better', 'was', 'role', 'Reverend', 'Captain', 'Samuel', 'Johnson', 'Clayton', 'minister', 'police', 'depending', 'need', 'time', 'Hank', 'Worden', 'memorable', 'Old', 'Mose', 'more', 'little', 'crazed', 'old', 'fool', 'who', 'films', 'more', 'memorable', 'moments', 'instance', 'Rangers', 'entrenched', 'one', 'side', 'river', 'bracing', 'meet', 'onrushing', 'group', 'Indians', 'Mose', 'suddenly', 'out', 'Oh', 'Lord', 'what', 'are', 'receive', 'thank', 'thee', 'key', 'film', 'however', 'apart', 'Ford', 'performance', 'John', 'Wayne', 'not', 'simplistic', 'Indian', 'killer', 'fighter', 'see', 'most', 'Wayne', 'films', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'seen', 'suffered', 'too', 'much', 'Ironically', 'chasing', 'rogue', 'Indian', 'chief', 'named', 'Scar', 'so-called', 'scar', 'running', 'down', 'side', 'face', 'Ethan', 'far', 'more', 'scarred', 'Indian', 'hunt', 'Debbie', 'who', 'been', 'abducted', 'Indians', 'weeks', 'months', 'years', 'correspondingly', 'more', 'more', 'obsessed', 'point', 'near', 'insanity', 'Indeed', 'much', 'tension', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'distrust', 'Ethan', 'sanity', 'part', 'Martin', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'scene', 'where', 'Ethan', 'finally', 'fate', 'Debbie', 'one', 'great', 'moments', 'cinema.This', 'just', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'great', 'masters', 'American', 'cinema', 'greatest', 'performance', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'stars', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'film', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'would', 'be']",N/A

'The Searchers' captures the vast, sprawling desert wilderness in grand Technicolor fashion...- 'Stagecoach"" is the first movie Ford filmed in Utah's Monument Valley...

In 'The Searchers' he is an embittered man, a prejudiced Indian hater...- The essence of 'Stagecoach' is the humanity that resides in all of us... The essence of 'The Searchers' is one man's tragedy...'The Searchers' is a stunning film with enormous scope, and breathtaking beauty, the ultimate meeting of two legends who frequently worked together--John Ford and John Wayne...""The Searchers"" brings the feeling to focus in the story of the abduction by Indians of two white girls and the long hunt for them that becomes a personal crusade...""The Searchers"" is about just such a raid and the terrible obsession of a man who seeks not only to rescue captives but to exact fearful vengeance...John Wayne comes riding back from Confederate service in the Civil War, three years after it's over, to the Texan ranch he co-owns with his brother (Walter Coy). There's bitterness and mystery about the man... There are gold double eagles in his saddle-bags and there's a clammed up look in his eyes that says whatever he's done, or whatever he's been through, he's telling nothing... It's obvious, though, that he's glad to be home, that he's quite fond of his brother's wife (Dorothy Jordan), but he hates the fact that they've adopted a Cherokee half-breed (Jeffrey Hunter) into the family...When Ward Bond, a preacher-cum-Rangers' captain, drops in to form a posse, Wayne goes along with him, only to find later that they've been decoyed away by Comanches...

The eye is constantly filled with space, and isolation... It is perhaps the first film to clearly investigate the emotional bases for the racial tensions between Indians and whites, and shows a shocking massacre of a Comanche village...John Ford was certainly a fantasist that has meditated on the West for a long period of years and has created an imaginary West that is uniquely his own...

106147,A1JIPFV4OL520T,0790736918,Robert Wynkoop,"[4, 5]","John Wayne plays the anti-hero Ethan Edwards who returns undefeated and unrepentant three years after the defeat of the Confederacy to the family ranch in Texas.  Soon after his arrival the ranch is raided by Commanches, the family murdered and Ethans young niece is kidnapped.  The rest of the movie portrays Ethans five-year quest for his niece.In a real sense, Ethans search for his niece is reminisence of  Melvilles Moby Dick.  The relentless pursuit of the white whale represents not only Ahabs vengeance against the animal for taking his leg, but also an attempt to pursue and defeat the God who allowed this misfortune to happen.  Thus, Ahab abandons all reason in his monomaniacal thirst for revenge.  The chase becomes more than a whaling story for in killing Moby Dick Ahab is avenging himself against God; but in the end Ahab and his crew perishes before the White God.  Compare this to Ethans monomaniacal pursuit to kill Scarface, the chief who lead the raiding party that killed Ethans family and to rescue his niece.  Ethan abandons reason and gives into blind hatred- shooting the eyes out of a dead Indian, taking parting shots at retreating Indians when everyone else has stopped firing, killing the buffalo so Indian families will starve and threatening to kill his own niece who has been defiled by the Indians. This is more than a search and rescue mission- it is Ethans attempt to come to grips with the defeat of the Confederacy, to gain victory where he has only known defeat.  It is more than a story of vengeance.  It is a story of a man facing his prejudice and blind hatred of the Indians. Ethan does not directly battle God, but he battles the inner demons that plague him. In the end, unlike Ahab, he finds redemption.  He rescues his niece and as the family enters the home to celebrate the reunion, Ethan turns and leaves.  He is alone, but he is at peace with himself.",5,Similarities to Captain Ahab and his pursuit of Moby Dick,1070668800,"12 6, 2003",2003,1902,"['John', 'Wayne', 'anti-hero', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'who', 'undefeated', 'unrepentant', 'three', 'years', 'defeat', 'Confederacy', 'family', 'ranch', 'Texas', 'Soon', 'arrival', 'ranch', 'raided', 'Commanches', 'family', 'murdered', 'Ethans', 'young', 'niece', 'kidnapped', 'rest', 'movie', 'portrays', 'Ethans', 'five-year', 'quest', 'niece.In', 'real', 'sense', 'Ethans', 'search', 'niece', 'reminisence', 'Melvilles', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'white', 'whale', 'not', 'only', 'Ahabs', 'vengeance', 'animal', 'taking', 'leg', 'also', 'attempt', 'pursue', 'defeat', 'God', 'who', 'allowed', 'misfortune', 'happen', 'Thus', 'Ahab', 'reason', 'monomaniacal', 'thirst', 'revenge', 'chase', 'more', 'whaling', 'story', 'killing', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'Ahab', 'avenging', 'God', 'end', 'Ahab', 'crew', 'perishes', 'White', 'God', 'Compare', 'Ethans', 'monomaniacal', 'pursuit', 'kill', 'Scarface', 'chief', 'who', 'lead', 'raiding', 'party', 'killed', 'Ethans', 'family', 'rescue', 'niece', 'Ethan', 'abandons', 'reason', 'blind', 'hatred-', 'shooting', 'eyes', 'dead', 'Indian', 'taking', 'parting', 'shots', 'retreating', 'Indians', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'stopped', 'firing', 'killing', 'buffalo', 'so', 'Indian', 'families', 'will', 'starve', 'threatening', 'kill', 'own', 'niece', 'who', 'been', 'defiled', 'Indians', 'more', 'search', 'rescue', 'mission-', 'Ethans', 'attempt', 'come', 'grips', 'defeat', 'Confederacy', 'gain', 'victory', 'where', 'only', 'known', 'defeat', 'more', 'story', 'vengeance', 'story', 'man', 'facing', 'prejudice', 'blind', 'hatred', 'Indians', 'Ethan', 'not', 'directly', 'battle', 'God', 'inner', 'demons', 'plague', 'end', 'Ahab', 'redemption', 'niece', 'family', 'home', 'celebrate', 'reunion', 'Ethan', 'alone', 'peace']",N/A

106149,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,0790736918,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[2, 2]","'The Searchers' is by no means a perfect movie but, at the same time, it IS a great movie.  It is fascinating that John Wayne was at his best when he stepped out of his classic 'good guy' image.  This is true of all his truly great movies whether it be 'The Searchers', 'True Grit', or his almost perfect, 'The Shootist.'  Wayne was an actor acutely concerned about his image and I would love to know how he personally felt about roles in which he played flawed, complex characters.This movie seems to be a compilation of historical information and novelistic interpretation.  Cynthia Parker was actually kidnapped by the Comanche and was only 'liberated' after 24 years.  She had married and gave birth to Quanah Parker who became the Comanche's greatest warchief.  This is only the bare bones of stories played out multiple times in the land that would become America.  Settlers on the frontier are the victims of lightening raids by hostile war parties.  All seems to be well when suddenly someone is crashing in your door.  Families were slowly tortured and murdered...all to the amusement of the warriors.  Children and women were sometimes taken captive.  The children were oftentimes raised as their own by the tribe.  Women captured were, generally speaking, regarded as the mutual property of the war party, and, in the vast majority of cases, the victims of mass rape.  On arriving at the village, the raped women became the sole property of the capturing warrior and, again in most cases, was used as a slave for both work and sex.This is the context of the attitudes that the John Wayne character expresses so well.  People living on the frontier lived in almost constant horrific fear...and hatred.  For those who actually visit the scenes of the torture, rape and murder of friends and relatives the hatred could become consuming...as it nearly consumes Wayne's character.  This is perhaps difficult to understand in these politically correct times but, let me suggest that those who condemn these attitudes search their own hearts, as well.  For us, these things are primarily historical and bear no more relationship to us than, let's say, stories of a massacre in far off Africa or Asia, 500 years ago.  At one time, however, the danger was personal and, you, me and virtually everyone else, had we lived under the danger of a scalping knife, would have felt very differently.This is not to justify the destruction of the native americans but it is to place it in a personal context, without which the destruction seems not only wrong but nonsensical.  The Wayne character is idiosyncratic and prejudiced.  He has survived a long war and refused to sign the Yankee 'Loyalty Oath'.  He returns home three years after the War and, at one point, gives the child Debbie a military decoration...probably Maximillian/Mexican...as a bauble, so we suspect that Wayne didn't give up the fight in 1865 but only moved it to Mexico.  He also knows a lot about the Plains Indians and even speaks Comanche....but it doesn't make him love them.Wayne's brother's family is slaughtered by the Comanche...and he views the horrific scene with grim hatred.  Two girls...one in her late teens and the other, Debbie, a child...have been carried off by the war party.  Wayne and others pursue.  Wayne, by himself, discovers the body of the older girl...raped and mutilated...and covers her with his Confederate great coat and 'I buried her with my own hands', he tells the others in his grim but harrowing grief.The search for little Debbie goes on literally for years and, when Wayne discovers that she has 'been with a buck', and been thereby contaminated, his search becomes that of a strange vengeance.  Debbie has been turned into one of the hated Comanche and must die.  On attacking the village in which Debbie is kept, Wayne, true to himself, scalps 'Scar' the chief who is keeping Debbie as a wife.  The last scenes of the movie are of both Debbie's and Wayne's redemption.

But with that said, This is John Wayne's film. This is Wayne's first western that takes him to another level outside of the hero good guy he was always playing. Red River touched a little bit to his dark side but this film was simply the framework for him to truly shine as a diverse and incredibly underrated talent. At first he starts out as a bigoted hero going out with his ""nephew"" to find the kidnapped niece. But slowly you begin to realize that he has other motives. In the scene where they are at a fort we see several white girls who had been kidnapped by the Comanches and finally had been rescued only to see that they are now emotionally disturbed. Ethan (Wayne) sais they are no longer white, they are now infact (Comanche). This line opens the door to what Ethan's new motives are for finding his neice. After he sais this line and begins to walk out the door, one of the girls screams and Ethan turns around to look. The stare captured on film and the look in Wayne's eyes is chilling beyond words. You can almost feel the hatred for the Comanches spilling out of his icey glare.This is the film Wayne should have gotten his oscar for. True Grit was also great but this is the real Poer House performance of the two.The film is not all gloom either. There are some funny scenes when Ethan is tucking Marty (a grown man)in bed and just saying ""Just making sure you're comfortable"". And also when Marty ends up with a Comanche squaw following him around much to his dislike, and Ethan calling her ""Mrs. Pawlie"". That scene always cracks me up. I rate this #1 as far as westerns are concerned but this film goes way beyond that.

106157,A6FIAB28IS79,0790736918,Samuel Chell,"[5, 7]","Ethan Edwards is one of the screen's most memorable and complex characterizations.  His racism, impassioned rage, cold brutality, rugged individualism, and indestructible tenacity coexist with qualities of tenderness and affection, penetrating insight and principled high-mindedness.  Yet much of him remains inscrutable, testimony to the mysteries of human identity itself.  In many respects, Marty (Jeff Hunter) is the nominal &quot;hero,&quot; someone who strikes a balance between the individual and social world, frontier and domestic realm, and who sees beyond skin color and blood to the spiritual bond that  unites all human beings.  But there's no way John Wayne's tortured character--driven by lost opportunities in the past and vengeful priorities in the present--can be challenged.  He shoots out the eyes of dead Indians to insure their spirits will never be admitted to the happy hunting grounds, but like Oedipus and Lear it is his own blindness that denies him peace.  His epiphany is all the more powerful due to its unexpectedness.Even were the rest of the film prosaic, &quot;The Searchers&quot; would rank among the best of American cinema.  But John Ford's storytelling magic is also on display at its best, creating an epic narrative that conveys the magnitude of space and the passing of time with equal verisimilitude.  Curiously, &quot;Shane&quot; commands a considerably higher price than &quot;The Searchers.&quot;  I'd argue that &quot;Shane,&quot; a much heralded film at the time of its release, has lost stature and cinematic interest, whereas exactly the opposite is true of &quot;The Searchers.&quot;  As for print quality, the restored DVD version is far from perfect but at least 50% better than earlier VHS editions.

This is John Wayne's favorite ""John Wayne movie,"" and his acting is superb.The scenery of ""The Searchers"" is beautiful. Monument Valley doesn't have anything to do with cattle ranching - dude, it's DESERT - but so what? We're watching either the actors, or the sweeping landscapes. The color is absolutely true to life - the sky is blue, the scrufty plants are varying shades of green, and everything else is red. It feels a lot like being dropped onto Mars.The cast is fabulous - John Ford's cadre of western regulars is very well represented. None of them (except Wayne and possibly Ward Bond) were capable of carrying even a minor movie, but as an ensemble they all do their jobs to perfection. My favorite among the supporting cast is Bond - a perennial Wayne sidekick - playing Rev. Capt. Samuel Johnston Clayton, the preacher who is also a Captain in the Texas Rangers.If you haven't seen The Searchers, you're in for a real treat. I absolutely recommend it.[I've read a couple reviews complaining that the Blu-Ray transfer isn't wide-screen. There is a really great reason: John Ford didn't have what we would think of as wide-screen cameras. (See what I mean about knowing about movies?) In 1991, I stayed at Goulding's Lodge, the hotel in the middle of Monument Valley, which is where a number of Ford's movies were shot.

This was made in 1956, by a director who had been working in films from the 1930's. Unlike modern films the pace is leisurely and the character development is measured. Even compared with say the first Clint Eastwood dollars movie (8 or 9 years later) this is filmmaking from a different era.The story is simple Ethan's niece (a young Natalie Wood) is kidnapped by Indians. Ethan (John Wayne) vows to find her and then (after time has gone by) to kill her (as she has presumably been abused by the Indians). There is no question this is John Waynes best acting performance.A previous reviewer has critised the portrayal of Indians as savages, and some of the interior (exterior) sets - but like I said above this is a film that has to viewed in context.

How about if we knock it down a  peg and call it merely very good or excellent?  In 1868 Texas, Cavalry officer Ethan Edwards (John Wayne at his most unsympathetic) finally returns home-only to find that Comanche Indians have kidnapped his two granddaughters and killed the younger of the two.  With son or grandson Jeffrey Hunter, Wayne goes on a ten year vendetta all over beautiful Monument Valley in search of the kidnapped Debbie (Natalie Wood, one year after REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE).  Does he find her alive?  Dead?  Does she want to come home with a veritable stranger after years of being raised as a Comanche?  And what does Wayne do to the Comanche villain Scar?  This is a profoundly unhappy family saga.Ravishingly photographed, in Technicolor and VistaVision, THE SEARCHERS is basically a bleak character study of an existential loner.  He is warmly welcomed home at the beginning as a door opens; he is left outside alone at the end as the same door closes, in a classic scene.  The film is helped by superb supporting work by some of Ford's repertory cast, especially Vera Miles, Ward Bond, and Olive Carey.  But it is done in, for me personally, by Hank Worden's bald-headed idiot Moze and by whoever plays the guitar and laughs ""Haw, haw, haw, haw, haw.""  I simply can't stand either of them here.  On the other hand, Wayne has one of his finest roles and gives one of his greatest performances; he deserved an Oscar nomination.THE SEARCHERS is not one of the greatest westerns of all time for me, but it certainly is superb and one of director/producer Ford's best films of the 1950's.

106174,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,0790736918,Steven A. Peterson,"[3, 5]","This is one of John Ford's and one of John Wayne's best movies.  It is a classic--but dark and ambiguous.  It deserves to be rated as one of the top American movies of the past 100 years. Whenever I watch it, I end up having a different reaction to the movie and its characters. And that is one characteristic of a special movie.Others have commented on some of the symbolism--the doors.  Ethan, John Wayne's character, always seems somehow ""outside.""  And that is a part of the movie's power.  At the outset, he visits his brother and family; he shows off money and it is not at all clear that it was legitimate.  Ambiguity: The source of the money? Where he had been?His brother and wife are killed in a Comanche raid; the daughters are taken prisoner, one of whom is killed shortly thereafter. The other, played by Natalie Wood as a teenager, ends up living with the Comanche.  And Ethan's attitude toward her is, as one might guess, ambiguous. If he finds her, what will he do? The scenery in this movie is awesome, filmed in Monument Valley, a discovery for location by John Ford (he filmed a number of his classic Westerns there).Ethan and Martin (played by Jeffrey Hunter) become searchers, looking for the surviving daughter.  In the several years covered, we come to be familiar with the stock players in the John Ford industry (such as Ward Bond and Harry Carey, Junior) and find that Ethan and Martin are continually thwarted.  Then, they receive information that suggests her location.The Texas Rangers under Ward Bond and the advance trooper from the cavalry contingent (well played for humor by Patrick Wayne, the Duke's son) make the effort to rescue Ethan's niece.And then the ambiguity toward the end.  What will be Ethan's stance toward his niece?  How will Martin respond?  A powerful ending.  And then, at the close, a door.In this movie, there is more complexity and ambiguity than one often finds in Westerns.  Native Americans are less stereotyped here than in other Westerns (including Ford's movies); the hero (Ethan) isn't really a hero; there is no wonderful happy ending.Perhaps the ambiguity and the symbols of doors and so on are part of what makes this a special movie.  While Native Americans are not as stereotyped as in other movies, they are still not portrayed particularly well. There is grimness to the movie that can wear on one.  But that is also a part of the movie's strength.So, all in all, a classic Western, and one that is more subtle than most of its genre.",5,An ambiguous classic,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,2504,"['one', 'John', 'Ford', 'one', 'John', 'Wayne', 'best', 'movies', 'classic', 'dark', 'ambiguous', 'be', 'rated', 'one', 'top', 'American', 'movies', 'past', '100', 'years', 'Whenever', 'watch', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'different', 'reaction', 'movie', 'characters', 'one', 'characteristic', 'special', 'movie.Others', 'have', 'commented', 'symbolism', 'doors', 'Ethan', 'John', 'Wayne', 'character', 'always', 'somehow', 'outside', 'part', 'movie', 'power', 'outset', 'brother', 'family', 'money', 'not', 'clear', 'was', 'legitimate', 'Ambiguity', 'source', 'money', 'Where', 'had', 'been', 'brother', 'wife', 'are', 'killed', 'Comanche', 'raid', 'daughters', 'are', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'one', 'whom', 'killed', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'other', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'teenager', 'up', 'living', 'Comanche', 'Ethan', 'attitude', 'one', 'might', 'guess', 'ambiguous', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'scenery', 'movie', 'awesome', 'filmed', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'discovery', 'location', 'John', 'Ford', 'filmed', 'number', 'classic', 'Westerns', '.Ethan', 'Martin', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'become', 'searchers', 'looking', 'surviving', 'daughter', 'several', 'years', 'covered', 'come', 'be', 'familiar', 'stock', 'players', 'John', 'Ford', 'industry', 'such', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Junior', 'find', 'Ethan', 'Martin', 'are', 'continually', 'thwarted', 'Then', 'receive', 'information', 'location.The', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'advance', 'trooper', 'cavalry', 'contingent', 'well', 'played', 'humor', 'Patrick', 'Wayne', 'Duke', 'son', 'make', 'effort', 'rescue', 'Ethan', 'niece.And', 'then', 'ambiguity', 'end', 'What', 'will', 'be', 'Ethan', 'stance', 'niece', 'How', 'will', 'Martin', 'respond', 'powerful', 'ending', 'then', 'close', 'door.In', 'movie', 'more', 'complexity', 'ambiguity', 'one', 'often', 'Westerns', 'Native', 'Americans', 'are', 'less', 'stereotyped', 'here', 'other', 'Westerns', 'including', 'Ford', 'movies', 'hero', 'Ethan', ""n't"", 'really', 'hero', 'wonderful', 'happy', 'ambiguity', 'symbols', 'doors', 'so', 'are', 'part', 'what', 'special', 'movie', 'Native', 'Americans', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'stereotyped', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'still', 'not', 'portrayed', 'particularly', 'well', 'grimness', 'movie', 'can', 'wear', 'one', 'also', 'part', 'movie', 'strength.So', 'classic', 'Western', 'one', 'more', 'subtle', 'most', 'genre']",N/A

Unfortunately, the film as a whole falters because too many aspects of it are frustratingly underdeveloped.Tragedy strikes when marauding Comanches massacre the family of Ethan Edwards' (John Wayne) brother.  He sets out with a group of men to find his abducted nieces upon realizing they were not killed in the attack.  As the years pass, only Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) remains from Ethan's group of searchers.  Eventually the two men find the grown-up Debbie (Natalie Wood) and confront Chief Cicatrice (Henry Brandon), the man known as Scar and the person responsible for the raid.""The Searchers"" has its share of problems: its attempt at humor with Martin and his Comanche bride is awkward and mean-spirited, Scar is a stock villain devoid of any depth, and the swiftness in which Debbie changes allegiances is jarring.  In addition, the parallels between Ethan and Scar are not pursued to much satisfaction.  Both men have legitimate reasons for their hate but ""The Searchers"" fails to examine how each man mirrors the other.  Yet, this is not to say that the film does not have much going for it: Wayne and Hunter are excellent in their roles, the frequent use of symbolism is interesting, and the bold exploration of racial prejudice is heady stuff for a film from the Fifties.

The callous way Jeffrey Hunter's character kicked the native woman and then laughed at her as if she had no feelings as a human being... worse than you would treat a dog... this behavior was disgusting actually. Natalie Wood wore makeup of the 1950s and didn't come close to portraying her character accurately. In fact, all of the characters were portrayed as if they were un-intelligent.

My favorite of all of the John Wayne movies.  This is a story of a man who has a fericous hatred of Indians that put General Sherman to shame.  General Sherman believes that the only good Indian is a dead Indian.  Wayne's character Ethan beleives that a dead niece is better than a live niece turned squaw.  His neice, Debbie, is kidnapped by by a Commanche Chief named Scar.Scar isn't the typical sterotype Indian.  Like Ethan, he is full of hatred and vengence from his dealings in war.  Ethan is a man who dearly loves his neice and gives her a civil war medal.  However, he is also a man who dislike Marty (Hunter) because he is quarter Cherokee whom he regrets rescuing as a baby.  Ethan also has a mysterious past.  He's been missing since the end of the Civil War, shows up with a lot of money freshly minted, and matches quite a few descriptions.To ease the tension, John Ford wisely includes some comedy.  Mose Harper (Worden) provides the best as an idoit who's the Texas Ranger's mascot.  Cpt Rev Johnson (Bond)is fire and brimstone whom gets the best of by Wayne and Lt. Greenfield (Pat Wayne!).  Marty accidently marries a squaw and later fight a Seven brides for Seven brother fight with Charlie (Curtis).If there's any flaws is that the beautiful Vera Miles doesn't use her natural voice.  And that fight could have been improved upon.  Netherless, these are minor infractiions.  The picture quality could be improved, but the beauty of the Monument Valley is timeless.The main theme is the theme of whether love can conquer vengence:  to a certain extent yes.  The ending says it all.  Wayne picks up Debbie and sees her not as a squaw, but as a lost child.  Then when everyone goes in the house except Wayne who walks off and the doors shut.Nice features, nothing extra as in a documentary.

The story follows the efforts of two men trying to track down a kidnapped girl from Comanches over the course of five years.  The men tracking the tribe are a Confederate veteran and the girl's uncle and the other a family friend and also part Cherokee.  The film is beautifully shot as all John Ford westerns are, which adds to the overall mood of the movie.  There is a vastness to some scenes which show the futility of tracking down this girl after so many years.  The Searchers is a classic that provided John Wayne with a role that was different from any other he had previously played.John Wayne stars as Ethan Edwards, the Confederate veteran trying to track down his niece after his brother's family is slaughtered by a Comanche raiding party.  He plays the role of the racist veteran to perfection.  At times it is startling to see him in a role that differs so greatly from most other movies he had done.  Jeffrey Hunter plays Martin Pawley, the Duke's partner in his search for the kidnapped girl. He plays a good sidekick to Wayne throughout since they have such differing personalities in the movie.

106194,A3PD6WWOPKPLJ9,0790736918,"Wayne Engle ""Wayne Engle""","[4, 4]","Controversy has swirled around this western ever since its release in 1956. Chief among the criticisms leveled at it is John Wayne's Ethan Edwards' ""racist"" hatred of the Comanches, manifested from the first minute he sees his brother's stepson, who is one-eighth Indian. In this day and age, when anything that smacks of ""racism"" is deemed to lower a work of art's rating, Edwards' freely voiced antipathy to the Indians is considered by many to be more than sufficient to demote this film from ""Best Western of all time,"" which some have called it.I don't feel that way about ""The Searchers."" Ethan Edwards was a product of his time and society, and thus would not have stuck out as particularly ""different"" among Southern and Western men of that day. After all, it is made clear that he fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War.The only flaw I find in the depiction of Edwards' racial views is that the movie never makes quite clear why he hates the Indians to such an extreme degree. None of the other settlers appear to share his smoldering abhorrence of the Comanche. I have read a review which says that one can catch a fleeting glimpse of a tombstone in the scene in the cemetery; the epitaph states that a woman with the last name ""Edwards"" was killed by the Comanche years earlier. Could this have been Ethan's mother? His wife? No clue is ever given.All that having been said, the film is, I think, probably the greatest western ever made, partly because of the intense character study it does of Ethan Edwards. It does not condemn him as a ""racist,"" or as anything else. It merely shows him to us; the decision is ours to make. And I disagree with some reviewers who believe that Edwards seems to see the ""error of his ways"" in the final scenes. He sees no such thing. Look at his face in the more intense scenes leading up to the attack on the camp of Scar, the Comanche leader whose braves kidnapped the two girls, and you can see both rage and hatred etched in that face. Then look at his face again, in the brief shot just after he has exited Scar's tent, the dead Indian's scalp in his hand, and you'll see the hatred and anger gone; it has been purged by Scar's execution. When he approaches his niece, kidnapped five years before by the Indians and presumably having been ""sleeping with a buck"" -- Edwards' reason for wanting earlier to kill her -- one can tell by his manner that he now comes only to carry her home safely.Perhaps it's the mark of a great movie when people can disagree, often strongly, about its characters and meanings.

106199,ARFCORBCTKX1J,0790736918,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[5, 16]","The image quality of ""The Searchers"" is nothing short of startling. We'll get to that after I've lit into the film. Yes, I'm going to tear to pieces what is generaly considered one of /the/ great American films, and (by many people) the best Western ever made.John Ford was a great director, but I've never cared much for his Westerns. Maybe I'm tired of seeing Ward Bond play the same role again and again. Or perhaps it's just that I don't care for John Wayne, who is hardly my model of ideal manliness. (Jimmy Stewart was ten times the man John Wayne was.)""The Searchers"" has two major problems, neither of which -- as far as I know -- has ever been pointed out. (After writing this, I browsed the Amazon reviews and found that other people have almost-identical reservations.) They render it a far poorer film than it could or should have been.The first is that it tries to tell two stories that have little to do with each other, and fail to mesh in any meaningful way. The primary story is Ethan and Martin's five-year search for Ethan's kidnapped niece. This is intercut with the broadly comic narrative of Laurie's frustration at trying to get Martin to come back and marry her. (Note Ken Curtis, later Festus on ""Gunsmoke"", as her dorky, guitar-strumming suitor.)It doesn't work. The search is morbidly dark, while Laurie's plight is silly beyond belief. Any possibility of dramatic unity -- this is, after all, a serious film about a serious subject -- is destroyed. (Aristotle would have heartily agreed.)Which brings us to the other problem. John Wayne was no actor. He was more than a decade from reaching the point where he could turn in a credible/creditable performance (Rooster Cogburn in ""True Grit"", for which he won an undeserved Oscar). In ""The Searchers"" he is still John Wayne, with a limited performance range that doesn't extend beyond what John Wayne, the man, is capable of.True, Wayne had a difficult job for any actor -- he had convey his hatred of Indians and desire to kill Debbie for 99% of the film -- then abruptly change his mind. The problem is that we see no motivation for the change. He picks her up, she looks frightened (she knows what he intends), and then, out of nowhere, ""Let's go home, Debbie."" *It just isn't believable. Ford should have shown us John Wayne's face, so that we could have gotten /some/ idea of what was going through his mind. Why he doesn't is anyone's guess. Did he think Wayne was incapable of believably revealing his change of heart? Or did it never cross Ford's mind? Regardless, the film lands with a dramatic ""thud"" -- Something Important happens, but we don't have the least idea /why/. The moment the story is building up to /never occurs/.""The Searchers"" would have worked far better if it had stuck with the search, and ignored just about everything else. Yes, it would have been an even darker film, but it would have packed a far stronger punch.I should not fail to mention, if only in passing, Max Steiner's miserable score. ""Max Steiner"" and ""miserable score"" are more or less redundant. The few good moments are swallowed up in a lot of unnecessary and trivial music.So why do people hold ""The Searchers"" in such high esteem? The reason appears to be that it was one of the first ""deconstuctionist"" Westerns. ** Ethan Edwards is bluntly racist, and is determined to find his niece so he can kill her. She's been polluted by her five-year contact with the ""Comanch"", and his no longer a ""white"" woman. *** She'd be better off dead, and Ethan is the man to do it. But however awful the Indians' behavior is, we are not on Ethan's side. Our broad sympathies lie with the Indians, not the Americans. ****Unfortunately, ""The Searchers"" doesn't achieve what it sets out to do. It's all hat and no cattle. You don't get points for trying to be profound -- you actually have to achieve it. In this, ""The Searchers"" fails quite badly. It's easy to imagine a remake that's far superior to the original.As for the transfer... Oh... my... God... I couldn't believe it. It appears to have been derived from the VistaVision camera negatives. I have never seen a more exquisitely sharp and detailed video image (and with zero apparent edge enhancement). Ford's use of multiple image planes, some in-focus, the others out -- is clearly displayed. *****Please note that in the supplemental material, someone describes ""The Searchers"" as having been filmed in three-strip Technicolor, which it almost certainly wasn't. And Martin Scorsese avers that VistaVision has greater depth of field than conventional 35mm movies. Wrong -- it has less. (It's hard to understand how someone who's been making films for four decades doesn't understand Photography 101.)If you're a fan of ""The Searchers"", do yourself a favor and get the Blu-ray. Even if you don't care for the film, buy it anyhow. It's a great demo disk. This was a film /made/ for VistaVision (""Motion Picture High Fidelity"") -- the scenery alone is worth the price of admission.* One critic suggested that it's touching Debbie that causes his transformation. He can't bring himself to kill the flesh-and-blood being he knew as a child.** It also appears to be one of the first to make a stab at proper cowboy attire. Note the dusters on several characters.*** Another minor problem... Kidnapped whites almost always preferred living with the Indians. Debbie's willingness to return is not implausible, but it is unlikely. In the very last moments, she does show some apparent fear at being among whites again.**** According to the supplemental material, ""The Searchers"" was the first Western to show a lot of dead Indians lying around after having been massacred by whites.***** This is common in Ford's films.",3,A Blu-ray demo disk you /have/ to own.,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,5728,"['image', 'quality',

You must have this DVD in your collection.  You will watch it over and over and over.  It is definitely John Ford's best Western ever.  The only way this film could be better is if it was on Blu-Ray.,5,The Best Western Ever?

I had seen this as a child and didn't understand it then. Now I do.  It is a very interesting and good movie. It's not the John Wayne you are used to seeing and still his performance is excellent. The subject matter is a sensitive one that was being addressed back then, which is why you probably don't hear so much about it.  Though not all issues that come up in the movie are deeply addressed, I'm glad they didn't make a remake. There is only one John Wayne. Not a movie for young children to watch or hear.",4,New Wayne,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,606,"['Watched', 'movie', 'term', 'paper', 'nephew', 'had', 'write', 'comparing', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'had', 'seen', 'child', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'then', 'Now', 'do', 'very', 'interesting', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'John', 'Wayne', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'still', 'performance', 'excellent', 'subject', 'matter', 'sensitive', 'one', 'was', 'being', 'addressed', 'back', 'then', 'why', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'issues', 'come', 'up', 'movie', 'are', 'deeply', 'addressed', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'remake', 'only', 'one', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Not', 'movie', 'young', 'children', 'watch', 'hear']",N/A
