Over a decade after the Bosnian War, he searches out Robert De Niro at his rustic mountain cabin, spends the evening drinking Jaegermeister with him never letting on that he's come to kill De Niro for something he did during that conflict.They agree to go bow hunting for deer. In the early morning they separate in the field.This is when Travolta's true intention is revealed.He begins hunting De Niro with a bow, wounds him in the leg when he could've killed him.Travolta soon runs a badly limping De Niro down. Rather than kill him he wants to talk about why he's done all this.But first, a little torture....I really liked this one.The first surprise is John Travolta who is unrecognizable as Robert De Niro's pursuer. From what I can tell he does a great Slavic accent, too. Next is De Niro's performance. At age sixty-nine he was still vigorous and limber enough to take on a trying physical role.

However the roles here did not fit them.Travolta is a former Serbian death squad member who has a bone to pick with De Niro,  Seems De Niro was a US Army colonel who fought 10 years prior in the Kosovo campaign and he crossed paths with Travolta. The subsequent flashback scenes that set up the premise seem off the mark as both men look way too old to have participated in the Kosovo action. FYI, De Niro is 70 years old and no amount of makeup or fuzzy lighting makes him appear realistic playing a 37 - 40 year old in the flashbacks.Plot line is straightforward and most readers will guess the outcome an hour before the movie ends.

Now it's just another dubious paycheck job for a pair of aging hams that's getting a token theatrical release a month ahead of its arrival on video.""Killing Season'' provides Travolta -- with a shaved head, an Amish-style beard and a thick, dubious accent -- endless opportunities to chew the scenery as a loquacious Serbian soldier who somehow survived a mass execution by US soldiers during the Balkan ethnic wars in 1995.Eighteen years later, he has tracked down the grumpy leader of that death squad, played by De Niro. The latter is living a hermitic existence in an overdecorated cabin in the Appalachians and avoiding his very briefly glimpsed family.You would think someone who executed a bunch of Serbians would be wary of meeting one by chance in the woods, but De Niro invites Travolta to his cabin for a very tedious evening of drunken conversation and listening to Johnny Cash records.The next morning, De Niro -- who has foresworn guns for cameras -- agrees to join Travolta for a deer hunt, with both men carrying crossbows. It soon becomes apparent that De Niro is Travolta's actual prey.If you've always wanted to see Robert De Niro forced to thread a steel rod through an open wound and then strung upside down by John Travolta, this is the movie for you.Ditto if the idea of De Niro firing an arrow that pierces both of Travolta's cheeks and pins him to the cabin door sounds appealing.Not to mention De Niro waterboarding his wounded prey with heavily salted lemonade.Mark Steven Johnson, who directed such cinematic landmarks as ""Ghost Rider'' and ""Daredevil,'' moves the muddled story along at a snail's pace toward an anti-climactic ending in which God is invoked repeatedly.He throws in lots of scenic shots to pad things out to barely an hour and a half.De Niro mostly looks miserable and very tired and prattles on endlessly about forgetting the past.You better believe he's trying to forget the dreadful ""Killing Season,'' which the busy actor shot at least half a dozen films ago.",1,Robert De Niro and John Travolta are merely killing time in 'Killing Season',1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,2125,"['Fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'first', 'big-screen', 'teaming', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'John', 'Travolta', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'genuine', 'event', 'Now', 'just', 'dubious', 'paycheck', 'job', 'pair', 'aging', 'hams', 'getting', 'token', 'theatrical', 'release', 'month', 'ahead', 'arrival', 'video', 'Killing', 'Season', 'Travolta', 'shaved', 'head', 'Amish-style', 'beard', 'thick', 'dubious', 'accent', 'endless', 'opportunities', 'chew', 'scenery', 'loquacious', 'Serbian', 'soldier', 'who', 'somehow', 'survived', 'mass', 'execution', 'US', 'soldiers', 'Balkan', 'ethnic', 'wars', '1995.Eighteen', 'years', 'later', 'tracked', 'down', 'grumpy', 'leader', 'death', 'squad', 'played', 'De', 'Niro', 'latter', 'living', 'hermitic', 'existence', 'overdecorated', 'cabin', 'Appalachians', 'avoiding', 'very', 'briefly', 'glimpsed', 'family.You', 'would', 'think', 'someone', 'who', 'executed', 'bunch', 'Serbians', 'would', 'be', 'wary', 'meeting', 'one', 'chance', 'woods', 'De', 'Niro', 'Travolta', 'cabin', 'very', 'tedious', 'evening', 'drunken', 'conversation', 'listening', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'records.The', 'next', 'morning', 'De', 'Niro', 'who', 'foresworn', 'guns', 'cameras', 'join', 'Travolta', 'deer', 'hunt', 'men', 'carrying', 'crossbows', 'soon', 'apparent', 'De', 'Niro', 'Travolta', 'actual', 'prey.If', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'forced', 'thread', 'steel', 'rod', 'open', 'wound', 'then', 'strung', 'upside', 'down', 'John', 'Travolta', 'movie', 'you.Ditto', 'idea', 'De', 'Niro', 'firing', 'arrow', 'Travolta', 'cheeks', 'cabin', 'door', 'appealing.Not', 'mention', 'De', 'Niro', 'waterboarding', 'wounded', 'prey', 'heavily', 'salted', 'lemonade.Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', 'who', 'directed', 'such', 'cinematic', 'landmarks', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Daredevil', 'muddled', 'story', 'along', 'snail', 'pace', 'anti-climactic', 'ending', 'God', 'invoked', 'repeatedly.He', 'throws', 'lots', 'scenic', 'shots', 'pad', 'things', 'out', 'barely', 'hour', 'half.De', 'Niro', 'mostly', 'miserable', 'very', 'tired', 'prattles', 'endlessly', 'forgetting', 'past.You', 'better', 'believe', 'trying', 'forget', 'dreadful', 'Killing', 'Season', 'busy', 'actor', 'shot', 'least', 'dozen', 'films', 'ago']",Killing Season

Take Travolta looking in his mid-thirties and outfit him with the lamest ""Serbian"" accent you could possible imagine. Now send Johnny Travaltovitz on a mission to kill Travis Bickle Sr. with a bow and arrow. Now, before you mistake this story for the plot of the greatest comedy since Mel Brook's Blazing Saddles remember this is a ""serious"" film about war. For this reason the characters (who are constantly untying the knots holding them while the other character stands with his back to them reminiscing about the horrors of war) break into long, long meaningless soliliquies that would make Col. Kurtz in Apocolypse Now blush. Finally after several totally meaningless hours of knifing, stabbing, drinking, and telling stupid jokes the two give up, sit on a cliff edge, and call it a day. Bickle Sr. then goes to see his son and make nice nice, while Travoltovitz goes to a bar in Serbia, shoots down a shot of brandy, and stares meaninglessly into a misty mirror.

Written by Evan Daugherty and directed by Mark Steven Johnson this is a small cast film that concentrates much of the destructive impact of war on those who fight it and survive it. Many people seem to expect more from a film than simply viewing how war eats the brain and memory and after-war life, concentrating responses on actors' accents and implausible encounters, but the message is delivered well if you are open to hear it.KILLING SEASON is the confrontation of two veterans of the Bosnian War, an international armed conflict that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1 March 1992 and 14 December 1995 and is still remembered for the Bosnian ethnic cleansing campaigns and the violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas endured  murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, and deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas. One veteran is American, Benjamin Ford (Robert De Niro) whose life has become one of being a recluse in the back hills of Appalachia, ignoring his family and struggling with the atrocities he not only witnessed but participated in: the other a Serbian, Emil Kovac (John Travolta) who narrowly escaped assassination by Ford and the American troops and since the war has been hunting for Ford to make him confess his war crimes and suffer the consequences. Ford and Kovac meet surreptitiously at Ford's little cabin, and at first exchange food and drink only to have the reality surface of Kovac's intent to kill Ford. The remainder of the film is a cat-and-mouse game that braces the wills of each survivor in treacherous manners that make each man reopen old war wounds and find a new universality in the effects of war on the human mind.The film is shot in Georgia (cinematography is by Peter Menzies, Jr) with flashback black and white and sepia toned footage of the horrors of the Bosnian War. De Niro and Travolta manage these difficult roles well in this basically two-person film (Ford's son and daughter in law and new baby are adroitly played by Milo Ventimiglia and Elizabeth Olin, and the early scenes in Serbia are polished by performances by Diana Lyubenova, Kalin Sarmenov and Stefan Shterev). The tension is underlined by a fine musical score composed by Christopher Young.This film may not meet everyone's expectations of big noisy extravaganzas, but as a powerful antiwar statement is works exceptionally well.

The show should have been titled Who's Torturing Who as the two men take turns kicking each other about and doing truly nasty things that are no doubt designed to shock the audience (Ooh!).While the filmmakers may have had noble intentions with the violent setups, it is difficult to enjoy the film which veers between bad accents and B-movie setups.  This despite a poignant ending scene by DeNiro that underscores the message of the story.  The film actually has a decent conclusion, but by that time, we're exhausted in watching Travolta and DeNiro rolling around in their sandbox for 90 minutes - and relieved when the end comes.So while the film has some minor highlights, the overall experience probably isn't worth it, unless you're pining for a DeNiro fix or want to see Travolta return to his pre-Pulp Fiction acting form.Bring back Rambo I say.

1651934,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00CX7TOOG,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","It's always nice to see an actor playing a part that suits their age rather than attempt something they are far too old for. I recently found it difficult to accept Sharon Stone playing an investigative reporter in BORDER RUN because the role was definitely something an actress in her late 20s or early 30s should have been playing. So when I heard that Robert DeNiro was going to be playing a vet of the Bosnian war in KILLING SEASON I was wondering how it would play out. Fortunately it comes off pretty well.DeNiro plays Benjamin Ford, an ex-military man who now resides in a cabin in the woods. While we aren't quite sure why he chooses to live out away from people we know there is a reason. Called by his son to attend his grandson's baptism, Ford turns down the offer choosing instead to remain secluded at home.At the same time we're introduced to Emil Kovac (John Travolta), a Serb who is intent on tracking down Ford. As the movie opened we witnessed a group of Serbian soldiers being executed by U.S. military personnel. It's safe to assume Ford was in this group. But why, if they were executed, would Kovac be seeking him out? Revenge for himself? For family? Only time will tell.As the film progresses we see Ford having problems with an old war wound, running out of aspirin and heading for town to buy some. Along the way he runs into a hiker walking along the road about the same time his jeep conks out on him. The hiker is, of course, Kovac. He helps Ford get the jeep started again and after heading the other direction in the rain, Ford turns around and offers him a place to stay for the night at his cabin.The two sit down to dinner and drinks, Kovac having brought along a bottle of Jagermeister. As the liquor loosens their tongues the two share their thoughts of battles past and of their own personal histories. While Kovac pretends to know only what he's read about war Ford lets him know in no uncertain terms that there is much horror to be found there, that it isn't the glorious warrior way so many depict it as. When all is said and done they turn in with plans to hunt the next day.During this hunting trip things change. Both men are armed with bow and arrow combinations but its photography that interests Ford now. That is until an arrow goes whizzing past him, narrowly striking him in the head. Kovac reveals his true mission for being there, to take down Ford for what happened in the past (which I won't reveal here).The pair struggle through the woods back and forth, one having the advantage over the other and then switching as circumstances change things. Through it all they continue to talk about the horrors of war and what it means to those who fought in them. Just who will survive this confrontation in the woods isn't revealed until the end of the film.As I said, it was nice to see DeNiro playing a role that could actually suit his age. Had he been in the Bosnian War he would have been in his 50s and how he looks now he could have been in his 40s. As a career military man that's possible. His character is one who is tormented by his past, what he saw and what he participated in. Here we are 18 years later and he still hasn't come to terms with that. That makes for the subtle parts of the character he plays here.Travolta also fits the age bracket for this role. Sporting a semi-beard and a thick accent, he pulls off the role of Kovac with ease. There are many who would say that Travolta was just a pretty boy in most of his roles but they would be doing him a disservice. He brings a depth to Kovac that proves he is quite capable of bringing something to a role that some refuse to see. He's a much better actor than given credit for and proves so here.KILLING SEASON offers a combination of story and action that holds your interest from start to finish. You want to find out what the back story is, you want to know if Kovac is seeking justice or revenge, you want to know just what has twisted Ford's head for these 18 years and if he will change. The movie may not be Oscar material but it does offer a nice combination of entertainment and thought provoking story that makes it worth watching.",3,HAUNTS OF THE PAST,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,4163,"['always', 'nice', 'see', 'actor', 'playing', 'part', 'suits', 'age', 'rather', 'attempt', 'something', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'recently', 'found', 'difficult', 'accept', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'playing', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'BORDER', 'RUN', 'role', 'was', 'definitely', 'something', 'actress', 'late', '20s', 'early', '30s', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'playing', 'when', 'heard', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'playing', 'vet', 'Bosnian', 'war', 'KILLING', 'SEASON', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'Fortunately', 'off', 'pretty', 'well.DeNiro', 'Benjamin', 'Ford', 'ex-military', 'man', 'who', 'now', 'cabin', 'woods', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'live', 'out', 'away', 'people', 'know', 'reason', 'Called', 'son', 'attend', 'grandson', 'baptism', 'Ford', 'down', 'offer', 'choosing', 'instead', 'remain', 'secluded', 'same', 'time', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Emil', 'Kovac', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Serb', 'who', 'intent', 'tracking', 'down', 'Ford', 'movie', 'opened', 'witnessed', 'group', 'Serbian', 'soldiers', 'being', 'executed', 'U.S.', 'military', 'personnel', 'safe', 'assume', 'Ford', 'was', 'group', 'why', 'were', 'executed', 'would', 'Kovac', 'be', 'seeking', 'out', 'Revenge', 'family', 'Only', 'time', 'will', 'tell.As', 'film', 'see', 'Ford', 'having', 'problems', 'old', 'war', 'wound', 'running', 'aspirin', 'heading', 'town', 'buy', 'way', 'hiker', 'walking', 'road', 'same', 'time', 'jeep', 'conks', 'out', 'hiker', 'course', 'Kovac', 'Ford', 'get', 'jeep', 'started', 'again', 'heading', 'other', 'direction', 'rain', 'Ford', 'around', 'place', 'stay', 'night', 'cabin.The', 'two', 'sit', 'dinner', 'drinks', 'Kovac', 'having', 'brought', 'bottle', 'Jagermeister', 'liquor', 'tongues', 'two', 'share', 'thoughts', 'battles', 'past', 'own', 'personal', 'histories', 'Kovac', 'know', 'only', 'what', 'read', 'war', 'Ford', 'know', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'much', 'horror', 'be', 'found', 'there', ""n't"", 'glorious', 'warrior', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'depict', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'turn', 'plans', 'hunt', 'next', 'day.During', 'hunting', 'trip', 'things', 'change', 'men', 'are', 'armed', 'bow', 'arrow', 'combinations', 'photography', 'interests', 'Ford', 'now', 'arrow', 'whizzing', 'narrowly', 'striking', 'head', 'Kovac', 'true', 'mission', 'being', 'there', 'take', 'down', 'Ford', 'what', 'happened', 'past', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'here', '.The', 'pair', 'struggle', 'woods', 'back', 'forth', 'one', 'having', 'advantage', 'other', 'then', 'switching', 'circumstances', 'change', 'things', 'continue', 'talk', 'horrors', 'war', 'what', 'who', 'fought', 'Just', 'who', 'will', 'survive', 'confrontation', 'woods', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'end', 'film.As', 'said', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'DeNiro', 'playing', 'role', 'could', 'actually', 'suit', 'age', 'Had', 'been', 'Bosnian', 'War', 'would', 'have', 'been', '50s', 'how', 'now', 'could', 'have', 'been', '40s', 'career', 'military', 'man', 'possible', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'tormented', 'past', 'what', 'saw', 'what', 'participated', 'Here', 'are', '18', 'years', 'later', 'still', ""n't"", 'come', 'terms', 'subtle', 'parts', 'character', 'here.Travolta', 'also', 'age', 'bracket', 'role', 'Sporting', 'semi-beard', 'thick', 'accent', 'role', 'Kovac', 'ease', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'would', 'say', 'Travolta', 'was', 'just', 'pretty', 'boy', 'most', 'roles', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'disservice', 'depth', 'Kovac', 'quite', 'capable', 'bringing', 'something', 'role', 'refuse', 'see', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'given', 'credit', 'proves', 'so', 'here.KILLING', 'SEASON', 'combination', 'story', 'action', 'interest', 'start', 'finish', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'back', 'story', 'want', 'know', 'Kovac', 'seeking', 'justice', 'revenge', 'want', 'know', 'just', 'what', 'twisted', 'Ford', 'head', '18', 'years', 'will', 'change', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Oscar', 'material', 'offer', 'nice', 'combination', 'entertainment', 'thought', 'provoking', 'story', 'worth', 'watching']",Killing Season

The basic plot intrigued me and I'm personally a sucker for hunting & hitman films, especially when its simply two opposing characters squaring off one on one, witch is exactly what this film is. Of course John Trovolta's fake serbian accent is bothersome and even annoying at times, but hey whatever, I like his past work so I was able to let it slide. Robert Deniro is just awesome in this one, he really made the viewing worth it for me personally. I also like it when a film or story has the protagonist carrying a handicap and disadvantage against the antagonist, it adds a more exciting dynamic and has makes me wonder how the hero will defeat/overcome the villain,  if he even defeats him at all. The ending was awesome and personally the best ending I would want for the film. There is alot of action, Deniro is fantastic in my opinion even for his age, he did great in the action scenes. OK NOW, chemistry between the two(& keep in mind it's really just these 2 actors for most of the film) was very interesting to see in my opinion.I myself am the kind of viewer who really honestly does not care or pay to much attention to chemistry between actors/characters in film. I of course find interaction between actors/characters in films fun and important sometimes, but overall Im passive about it. The interaction between Benjamin Ford(Robert DeNiro) & Emil Kovac(John Travolta) is again interesting enough to have kept my attention, It didn't bore me at all and the resolution between the two satisfied me personally. I recommend to those who like a hunter VS hunter, soldier VS soldier type of deal, kind of like the film Enemy At The Gates for example with Jude Law & ED Harris facing off ass 2 WW2 elite snipers.

The hell that both sides are submerged in Right Now. The senselessness of it all. My guess is this movie captures that a little. I assume from budget constraints or time restraints that the editor was forced to use lousy takes. This same restriction allowed for flaws in make up to show because the close-ups were just too close. This allowed for some really bad acting to show up in the final version of this movie. This actually made the acting look bad at times. But it does pull together and convey the more general idea that &#34;war is hell&#34; but the more disturbing attribute that for many there is no end in sight. And like the end of Blade Runner &#34;Maybe he just liked life and decided to let me live.... Not my life but any bodies life&#34; Dekard said in the narration.

The 91 minute 220px-Killing_Season_film_posterfilm stars two of my favorites, Robert DeNiro and John Travolta.During the war in Bosnia, DeNiro (portraying Benjamin Ford) and his platoon stumble on a Serbian soldiers who have decimated a village. They&#8217;ve raped the women and killed the men and children. Taking the law into their own hands they form a firing squad and take-out the opposing soldiers, shooting them in the back of the head. Travolta&#8217;s character (Emil Kovac) is one of those Serbian soldiers. Only he was left for dead.Angry, Kovac spends his life trying to track down the American soldiers responsible for the firing squad. Ford is a recluse. His marriage went to hell after the war. He barely knows his son. He lives in the mountians in a remote cabin and lives off the land.While on his way into town, Ford&#8217;s Jeep breaks down. Kovac, posing as a hiker on vacation, assists Ford with getting the Jeep started. They go back to Ford&#8217;s cabin and share dinner, and talk. Before long, it is clear that Kovac is there seeking revenge. Throughout, the two go at each other, back and forth. First Kovac has the upper hand. Then Ford. The torture they pour out is barbaric, and intense. (It almost is comical the cat-and-mouse game, if it weren&#8217;t so brutal).Basically, Kovac wants a confession. Ford wants to leave the past in the past. It seems like the only way this will resolve is if one of them dies &#8212; and they way they go at it, death seems highly likely!Killing Season was . . . good. I enjoyed it.

The images and soundtrack during that closing period were as good then as they were throughout the entire movie. This movie was a true roller coaster of suspense, drama and action. It is a deeply enriching movie with a subtle message, one that Hollywood is not known for, but it is there. To really understand the fullness of that message, watch those final closing credits and listen to the songs. If you are an astute listener, paying attention to the entire movie, you will have already gotten the message before then. This is essentially a two-man movie. The other few people who appear are more extras than anything. So the burden of this movie in on the shoulders of two of our finest males actors.In my opinion, this was a stellar movie. The outdoors scenes are beautifully shot. The suspense is intense. The action rugged and at times brutal.Fight scene coordination is credited to the legendary Jeff Imada.I paid the $6.99 price to see it now, because I sensed from the preview and the cast that it would be well worth that price. I was correct. I never give spoilers in my reviews, so you will have to depend on others for all that. If you love riveting action movies that pit man against man in the most harrowing of ways, this is one you will want to see, at least once. Some of it was shot in Bulgaria.Thanks for reading my review. Peace.PS: I have to laugh at those who cannot deal with Travolta's accent. He is playing the role of a Serbian Death Squad member. The accent is to lend realism to the character. It is easy to understand him, IF YOU LISTEN. This is not Honey Boo-Boo or some mindless ""reality"" show that you can watch while playing on the Xbox, cooking supper, or whatever it is you do. Americans are quick to turn off a person whose accent differs from theirs.

1651962,A26ZZRSLUYFIR4,B00CX7TOOG,S.L.,"[5, 8]","Good News first. This movie has two above average aspects; cinematography, and Robert DiNero. Camerawork does a fine job of taking you into the Black Forrest, and making you feel like you are there. DiNero is the textbook example of how to act, no matter what the script. Very beliveable character, and as an old soldier, I saw myself in him at times, especially with the personality ""quirks"". This is what the star is for. End of good news.Bad News. While I could go on and on, I will spare you. Just the high points. First and foremost, I don't know who the director was yet, but will make a point to NEVER again contribute to his livelyhood. While I do not believe in censorship, and Art is just that; fiction, one must own a certain ethic when producing media that could represent truth to the easily impressionable and ignorant. The US never has, nor ever will, execute prisoners on the battlefield. Nazis and Taliban; yes. American uniformed forces, NO! The movie opens like a documentary with statistics and historical reference, then shows captured Serbs being shot in the head while kneeling and bound, by US Army personnel. While many will not understand the difference, it is what allows us to hold the slightest shred of decency as soldiers, even when our politicians may be idiots all. Sure, acts of atrocity are commited by uniformed soldiers, but not as a matter of doctrine, rather individual acts of treason. Soldiers should not kill non-combatants, and bound prisoners are just that. Why DiNero would choose this script is puzzling, but is evidence of the statement this movie makes about how bankrupt Hollywood creativity is at the moment. There are no good scripts, or he would not have taken this DOG.Lastly, speaking of DOGs, I have not enjoyed Travolta since Pulp Fiction, where he was a perfect fit for his role. While it was pretty fun seeing him get stabbed in the leg in Savages, his current market value is also puzzling. Insofar as a Serbian national , his head is way too big, both figuratively and literally. Did not convince for one second that the accent was genuine, nor the resentment that fueled the character's vengence. All the fury of a Manatee, with a comical facial hair patch. That should have been the biggest red flag.This is one I wish I could unsee, as the statement made is how both Hollywood, and the Military Bashing Media that so influences them ( or is it the other way around? ) have nothing to offer.

When the two meet up again a new war begins, this time it becomes personal. I have never really been a Travolta fan and lately it seems that De Niro is very hit or miss so my excitement was tempered for this one. I have to say I really did enjoy this and the movie kept me interested the entire time. The movie is basically just these two hunting each other in the woods while they try to get inside the head of the other and try and understand why this is happening.

1651972,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00CX7TOOG,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Robert De Niro and John Travolta star in &#8220;Killing Season&#8221; (formerly titled &#8220;Shrapnel&#8221;) as a retired NATO operative and a former Serbian soldier respectively. Set deep in the Appalachian Mountains, the film follows their bloody battle, one being the hunter and the other the hunted, sometimes switching roles.The film&#8217;s premise may sound like that of &#8220;First Blood,&#8221; but the result is less compelling as thriller or drama. In spite of the graphic violence and beautifully-shot wilderness, &#8220;killing Season&#8221; fails to build up tension psychologically or otherwise because of the predictable storyline and underwritten back stories of both characters. Milo Ventimiglia and Elizabeth Olin are wasted in small and forgettable roles.Still I couldn&#8217;t hate the film simply because it has two of my favorite stars, even though obviously this is far from their best. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson (&#8220;Daredevil&#8221; &#8220;Ghost Rider&#8221;), &#8220;Killing Season&#8221; is an average action that could have been better with more skilled direction and perhaps budget, too.",3,De Niro and Travolta in One Movie; This Should Have Been Much Better,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,1129,"['Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'John', 'Travolta', 'star', '8220', 'Killing', 'Season', '8221', 'formerly', 'titled', '8220', 'Shrapnel', '8221', 'retired', 'NATO', 'operative', 'former', 'Serbian', 'soldier', 'respectively', 'Set', 'deep', 'Appalachian', 'Mountains', 'film', 'bloody', 'battle', 'one', 'being', 'hunter', 'other', 'hunted', 'sometimes', 'switching', 'roles.The', 'film', '8217', 'premise', 'may', 'sound', '8220', 'First', 'Blood', '8221', 'result', 'less', 'compelling', 'thriller', 'drama', 'spite', 'graphic', 'violence', 'beautifully-shot', 'wilderness', '8220', 'killing', 'Season', '8221', 'build', 'up', 'tension', 'psychologically', 'otherwise', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'underwritten', 'back', 'stories', 'characters', 'Milo', 'Ventimiglia', 'Elizabeth', 'Olin', 'are', 'wasted', 'small', 'forgettable', 'roles.Still', 'couldn', '8217', 'hate', 'film', 'simply', 'two', 'favorite', 'stars', 'even', 'obviously', 'far', 'best', 'Directed', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Johnson', '8220', 'Daredevil', '8221', '8220', 'Ghost', 'Rider', '8221', '8220', 'Killing', 'Season', '8221', 'average', 'action', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'skilled', 'direction', 'perhaps', 'budget', 'too']",Killing Season

1651974,A1S1BJFTA644TU,B00CX7TOOG,Zalmorion the Fantastic,"[0, 1]","Killing Season reminds me of Dead Man Down in that both movies received so little publicity and hype, but both of them are unexpected gems.  This movie is a well-written story of two men reeling from the Bosnian War.  They are broken and pursuing the wrong paths in life.  When they clash, it is for a good reason.  And that clash is pretty entertaining.The characters are developed enough for a movie that feels like a really enjoyable short story--if that makes sense.  The acting is superb--how could it not be?  Surprisingly, the action is tense and realistic.  The plot contains quite a few twists as well.  I enjoyed not knowing what would happen.Furthermore, this movie presents a deeper message about war and humanity that it refuses to shove down your throat.  In the end, you will contemplate war, the effects of war, the duties of a man as a human being, and all that sort of existential stuff.Definitely a surprisingly fun film to watch.  Who doesn't want to see two guys battle it out in the woods?  While it is not a life-shattering experience, it is light years beyond the crap we get from Hollywood.  If you enjoy meaningful movies with alternating paces and realistic violence, go for it.  RENT it.",4,Very Good Story.  Different.
