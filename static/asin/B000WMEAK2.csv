1110587,A1U58QQTR5UG1N,B000WMEAK2,anorthernsole,"[3, 5]","I was fortunate enough to catch a viewing of this DVD several months ago and it is superb.  It shows a side of Oasis that the fans don't get to see and after looking at some of the comments and ratings for the DVD, the fans probably don't deserve to see this side of Oasis.  For years the media has portrayed these guys as drunks, idiots, rude, etc...with this release we get to see Oasis as human beings.  Instead of just getting snippets of an interview in which Liam Gallagher tells a reporter that he is going to go ""kick someone in the n*$%"" in order to get some attention, we get the whole picture and see the sarcasm in Liam's gestures and get a feel for the annoyance of being asked the same stupid repetitive questions for the past 13 years.  I thank Oasis for sharing their lives on the road with us and to those who are criticizing this DVd for whatever reason, either get on the bus or go *%^# yourself in the bushes.Cheers!",5,Don't Believe the Idiots,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,936,"['was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'catch', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'superb', 'side', 'Oasis', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'looking', 'comments', 'ratings', 'DVD', 'fans', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'see', 'side', 'Oasis', 'years', 'media', 'portrayed', 'guys', 'drunks', 'idiots', 'rude', 'etc', 'release', 'get', 'see', 'Oasis', 'human', 'beings', 'Instead', 'just', 'getting', 'snippets', 'interview', 'Liam', 'Gallagher', 'reporter', 'going', 'go', 'kick', 'someone', 'n*', '%', 'order', 'get', 'attention', 'get', 'whole', 'picture', 'see', 'sarcasm', 'Liam', 'gestures', 'get', 'feel', 'annoyance', 'being', 'asked', 'same', 'stupid', 'repetitive', 'questions', 'past', '13', 'years', 'thank', 'Oasis', 'sharing', 'lives', 'road', 'who', 'are', 'criticizing', 'DVd', 'reason', 'get', 'bus', 'go', '*', '%', '^', 'bushes.Cheers']",Oasis: Lord Don't Slow Me Down

The film has a great 8mm/home movie aesthetic, which I thought was really strong. There are mostly tail-ends and bits of songs, keeping the focus on the band during off hours (I hope you guys are planning a DBTT concert DVD as well?), and these stage moments are interesting in the context of their traveling. There are many great scenes of what fills the time between gigs: the endless interviews, playing games, writing, etc. If you want to spend time on tour with a great band and you enjoy a cinema verite look, check this out. **other reviewers have noted that there is a longer version with a bonus concert disc.

1110594,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B000WMEAK2,Paul Allaer,"[9, 10]","In Spring, 2005, Oasis released its 6th studio album ""Don't Believe the Truth"", and immediately went on the road for what seemed to be a never-ending tour around the world in support of the album. The tour eventually wound up a full year later. This DVD is the chronicle of that tour.""Lord Don't Slow Me Down"" is split up in 2 DCDs. On DVD 1 (105 min.) it brings a documentary of what it's like to be on the road for such a long tour, and if there is one word that I can think of, it's ""slug"", as in: it's a slug to be touring. The documentary shows the band going from the hotel or the tour bus to yet another airport and another concert venue. The guys play cards a lot, do endless media interviews and other promotions, and generally do a lot of waiting around. Fun is different, it seems to me. The best part here is the 10-15 min. Q&A; bonus at the end with Noel, where he takes questions from the audience (not sure where or who), answering questions like what he thinks his most Beatles-esque song is (that would be ""All Around the World"", according to Noel).On DVD2 (90 min.), it brings the full show of Oasis' home-coming show in Manchester in July 2005. It sounds great, but the set is heavy on tracks from the mediocre ""Don't Believe the Truth"" and even worse, the setlist is simply too predictable. With as rich a back-catalogue as Oasis has, surely the band could've uncovered some better songs to play? I saw Oasis twice on this tour, and the setlist was virtually identical. As to the bonus materials, there are 12 clips from fans who were at the show and used their cell phone or digicam to prove it. Not surprisingly, these clips are virtually unwatchable due to the poor sound and/or video quality. In all, ""Lord Don't Slow Me Down"" is pretty much a letdown for me. If you want to watch Oasis at its best live, I would much rather recommend 1996's ""There and Then"" concert video, which is miles better than this.",3,The boredom of being on the road,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,1930,"['Spring', '2005', 'Oasis', 'released', '6th', 'studio', 'album', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Truth', 'immediately', 'went', 'road', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'never-ending', 'tour', 'world', 'support', 'album', 'tour', 'eventually', 'wound', 'up', 'full', 'year', 'later', 'DVD', 'chronicle', 'tour', 'Lord', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Slow', 'Me', 'Down', 'split', 'up', '2', 'DCDs', 'DVD', '1', '105', 'min', 'documentary', 'what', 'be', 'road', 'long', 'tour', 'one', 'word', 'can', 'think', 'slug', 'slug', 'be', 'touring', 'documentary', 'band', 'going', 'hotel', 'tour', 'bus', 'yet', 'airport', 'concert', 'venue', 'guys', 'play', 'cards', 'lot', 'do', 'endless', 'media', 'interviews', 'other', 'promotions', 'generally', 'do', 'lot', 'waiting', 'around', 'Fun', 'different', 'best', 'part', 'here', '10-15', 'min', 'Q', 'A', 'bonus', 'end', 'Noel', 'where', 'questions', 'audience', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'who', 'answering', 'questions', 'what', 'most', 'Beatles-esque', 'song', 'would', 'be', 'World', 'according', 'Noel', '.On', 'DVD2', '90', 'min', 'full', 'show', 'Oasis', 'home-coming', 'show', 'Manchester', 'July', '2005', 'great', 'set', 'heavy', 'tracks', 'mediocre', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Truth', 'even', 'worse', 'setlist', 'simply', 'too', 'predictable', 'rich', 'back-catalogue', 'Oasis', 'surely', 'band', 'could', ""'ve"", 'uncovered', 'better', 'songs', 'play', 'saw', 'Oasis', 'twice', 'tour', 'setlist', 'was', 'virtually', 'identical', 'bonus', 'materials', 'are', '12', 'clips', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'show', 'used', 'cell', 'phone', 'digicam', 'prove', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'clips', 'are', 'virtually', 'unwatchable', 'due', 'poor', 'sound', 'video', 'quality', 'Lord', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Slow', 'Me', 'Down', 'pretty', 'much', 'letdown', 'want', 'watch', 'Oasis', 'best', 'live', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'recommend', '1996', 'Then', 'concert', 'video', 'miles', 'better']",Oasis: Lord Don't Slow Me Down

1110597,A2SGZESU2OPFFM,B000WMEAK2,Tom Reagan,"[4, 5]","I've been an Oasis fan since 'Morning Glory was released and even own all of their singles/B-sides, so I was really looking forward to this tour documentary. But I was really disappointed in the film. It's boring. If you're not watching the band do awful interviews between shows, you're watching them play a damn board game or some other time killer. With all the footage the director shot, this was the best he could put together? They were on this tour for a year, but in the film, you don't get that sense of a year-long tour at all; there's never an indication of what city/country the band is in, or the dates of the shows. The fact that it's all in black and white doesn't help. Oh, and the handheld-NYPD Blue-style technique gets old really fast.Now on to the good: The Special Features:1. The audio commentary by the band is pretty humorous, especially having Noel and Liam taking fun-hearted jabs at each other, while watching each other on screen.2. The Q&A; between Noel and fans is pretty intriguing, as Noel is in a great mood, answers all questions honestly and thorough, all while cracking jokes. It's only audio (with more footage from the film), which is a bummer, but it's still very good.3. The concert on Disc 2, of course, is a great feature.
