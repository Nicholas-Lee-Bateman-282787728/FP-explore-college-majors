Does it include the Japanese, as well as Spanish dubbings? I have seen the Spanish dubbing extensively and I can say it is excellent. I have no doubt the Japanese one is good.As far as the series is concerned, it is by far one of the greatest I have seen in my life. It made a whole generation in Mexico get up at 7am on Saturday mornings for numerous years (cause that was the only time you could catch the new episode, no matter how many reruns there were at other schedules.)I only hope someone talks about the quality of THIS BOXED SET.",5,I love the series but...,1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,613,"['none', 'reviewers', 'talk', 'languages', 'included', 'set', 'include', 'Japanese', 'as', 'well', 'Spanish', 'dubbings', 'have', 'seen', 'Spanish', 'dubbing', 'extensively', 'can', 'say', 'excellent', 'have', 'doubt', 'Japanese', 'one', 'good.As', 'far', 'series', 'concerned', 'far', 'one', 'greatest', 'have', 'seen', 'life', 'made', 'whole', 'generation', 'Mexico', 'get', 'up', '7am', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'numerous', 'years', 'cause', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'could', 'catch', 'new', 'episode', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'reruns', 'were', 'other', 'schedules', 'only', 'hope', 'someone', 'talks', 'quality', 'THIS', 'BOXED', 'SET']",N/A

772067,A3CYEM1JJLLGUQ,B0000C0FJ9,"M. Nocerino ""Sci Fi Fan""","[0, 14]","This is a very strange anime.  On the surface it looks like it should be a fun, fighting-oriented story, like Dragonball Z.  Instead we get a messy and drawn-out plot that makes little to no sense.  As kids, each of the Saints was sent to a different part of the world for training and the opportunity to acquire one of the various Saint armors.  Years later they all came back to participate in a tournament that would decide who was to wear the golden armor and lead them all.  As all this is going, a new character is introduced who used to be a friend of the Saints, but is now their enemy.  They defeat him and go back to the tournament.  That's where I got fed up and stopped watching.  It just seemed like the series wasn't going anywhere.  It didn't seem like the plot was moving past the tournament or finding the true purpose of the Saints.For an older anime series, I was disappointed.  I was expecting something more along the lines of Robotech, or Voltron or even Akira in terms of style of story and overall joy to watch.  What we get is in no way close to the grandeur of Robotech.  It wasn't as outright fun to watch as Voltron.  And it lacked the outright appeal of Akira.  Bottom line:  we get a series that doesn't get anywhere fast and leaves the audience bored and looking for the remote.",1,"Seiya, Don't Wake the Sleeping Audience",1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,1309,"['very', 'strange', 'anime', 'surface', 'should', 'be', 'fun', 'fighting-oriented', 'story', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'Instead', 'get', 'messy', 'drawn-out', 'plot', 'little', 'sense', 'kids', 'Saints', 'was', 'sent', 'different', 'part', 'world', 'training', 'opportunity', 'acquire', 'one', 'various', 'Saint', 'armors', 'Years', 'later', 'came', 'back', 'participate', 'tournament', 'would', 'decide', 'who', 'was', 'wear', 'golden', 'armor', 'lead', 'going', 'new', 'character', 'introduced', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'friend', 'Saints', 'now', 'enemy', 'defeat', 'go', 'back', 'tournament', 'where', 'got', 'fed', 'up', 'stopped', 'watching', 'just', 'seemed', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'plot', 'was', 'moving', 'tournament', 'finding', 'true', 'purpose', 'Saints.For', 'older', 'anime', 'series', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'lines', 'Robotech', 'Voltron', 'even', 'Akira', 'terms', 'style', 'story', 'overall', 'joy', 'watch', 'What', 'get', 'way', 'close', 'grandeur', 'Robotech', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'outright', 'fun', 'watch', 'Voltron', 'lacked', 'outright', 'appeal', 'Akira', 'Bottom', 'line', 'get', 'series', ""n't"", 'get', 'anywhere', 'fast', 'audience', 'bored', 'looking', 'remote']",N/A

While the series has much to recommend it, it isn't at the level of Vision of Escaflowne or some of the other Greats of anime. But Saint Seiya WAS the anime that introduced me TO anime.Saint Seiya is also significant in that it essentially defined the &quot;God-warrior&quot; subgenre of anime, which includes such entries as Yoroiden Samurai Troopers (AKA Ronin Warriors), Shurato, and several others, with strong influence on shows like Sailor Moon.The basic outline of Saint Seiya is that there is a cycle of mystic significance in which Athena (Goddess of Wisdom and War) is reincarnated on Earth, along with her chosen guardians the Saints (empowered mystical warriors, wearing armor that signifies the various mythological constellations and grants its wearers powers that derive from the symbolism of the constellations) to do battle against the forces of darker nature, ultimately represented by the god Hades (her uncle and lord of the Underworld).The show itself is strongest in the first story arc (the Sanctuary story arc). All of the show's unique ideas -- the power of the Cosmos and the Saints, their particular abilities and the rationale behind them, etc. -- are developed in this season. The show is a classic &quot;Five-Team&quot; adventure, sharing many characteristics with the live-action Sentai series (such as the shows from which Power Rangers was derived), but with its own peculiar mythos and charm. The main characters are clearly delineated and developed -- Seiya, the stubborn one who just won't give up, Ikki the grim loner, Shun the sensitive one, Shiryu the wise one, and Hyoga the Just -- with more than their simple roles would require.The character designs are interesting, and the armor designs utterly unique. The power combats are highly stylized, however; those used to the much more detailed and &quot;realistic&quot; power-combats of Dragonball Z and similar shows will have to adjust to this much more impressionistic/artistic approach, which sometimes works and sometimes leaves a bit to be desired.Do not, on any account, listen to the hideous dubbed version on Cartoon Network. The translation is okay, but the voice acting is horrendous -- I have the impression that the poor VAs were given maybe five minutes with the script before doing a dub -- and with a show that has many potentially cliche'd moments and situations you need GOOD voice acting to carry it off.Saint Seiya is a piece of anime history, and worth a viewing by any fan of shonen (boys) anime.",5,Saint Seiya in the USA...
