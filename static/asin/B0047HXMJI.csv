Being a Cambodia nut I went straight to that particular episode and I did find it a bit light in some ways, with some aspects of recent history glossed over in a fairly confusing way, but she did go to the Killing Fields outside Phnom Penh and acknowledge the genocide- except it seemed, from her explanations, to have happened in a vacuum, there wasn't much clarification on how or why it occurred ( certainly no mention of the US bombing campaigns that pushed the Khmer Rouge towards their victory but I wasn't expecting this to be mentioned - bit of a downer for the regular viewer so let's move on). There are some inaccuracies- the National Museum is mistaken for the Royal Palace, and when she goes to the national park by Koh Kong, the guide's subtitles ( why he needed them is a mystery as he speaks clear English)erroneously have him talking about the mango forest when they are obviously going through a mangrove area.However, it is a good snapshot of the place, and her visit to Vietnam is also good viewing.

1388564,AZCR709KP5K34,B0047HXMJI,DougP,"[1, 1]","This series is beautifully shot and produced, and SB is charming and appealing in some ways, but the shows tend to be rather superficial and overly focused on Sam.  Sometimes the destination seems to be secondary, merely a backdrop for Sam's preening and her cutesy outfits and antics.  And while she is appealing, she is also overbearing and talks too much.  And the frequent guffaws and shrieks and general overreactions are troubling.  While she is on TV and has to be outgoing, I think Paul Theroux's advice that ""you gain nothing by standing out"" when traveling in other cultures is still relevant.I also noticed in the Malaysia episode a few silly gaffes or instances of ignorance  -- she referred to ""Peninsula Malaysia"" but it's ""Peninsular Malaysia""; she referred to ""Peninsula Borneo"" which is not only a grammar gaffe but a geographical one -- Borneo is an island not a peninsula; and she did not, or pretended not to, know what Kuala Lumpur meant in the native language.She also appeared decidedly uncomfortable in some of the open air markets, even remarking how she wanted to avert her eyes from the strange foodstuffs.  Why bother visiting?In all, a nice overview of some Asian destinations and a visual treat, but it's often spoiled by her cringe inducing behavior and lack of polish.  I suppose the show's intro tells you everything you need to know.",3,"beautiful package, bit thin on substance",1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,1367,"['series', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'produced', 'SB', 'charming', 'appealing', 'ways', 'shows', 'tend', 'be', 'rather', 'superficial', 'overly', 'focused', 'Sam', 'Sometimes', 'destination', 'be', 'secondary', 'merely', 'backdrop', 'Sam', 'preening', 'cutesy', 'outfits', 'antics', 'appealing', 'also', 'overbearing', 'talks', 'too', 'much', 'frequent', 'guffaws', 'shrieks', 'general', 'overreactions', 'are', 'troubling', 'TV', 'be', 'outgoing', 'think', 'Paul', 'Theroux', 'advice', 'gain', 'nothing', 'standing', 'out', 'when', 'traveling', 'other', 'cultures', 'still', 'relevant.I', 'also', 'noticed', 'Malaysia', 'episode', 'few', 'silly', 'gaffes', 'instances', 'ignorance', 'referred', 'Peninsula', 'Malaysia', 'Peninsular', 'Malaysia', 'referred', 'Peninsula', 'Borneo', 'not', 'only', 'grammar', 'gaffe', 'geographical', 'one', 'Borneo', 'island', 'not', 'peninsula', 'did', 'not', 'pretended', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'Kuala', 'Lumpur', 'meant', 'native', 'language.She', 'also', 'appeared', 'decidedly', 'uncomfortable', 'open', 'air', 'markets', 'even', 'remarking', 'how', 'wanted', 'avert', 'eyes', 'strange', 'foodstuffs', 'Why', 'bother', 'visiting', 'nice', 'overview', 'Asian', 'destinations', 'visual', 'treat', 'often', 'spoiled', 'cringe', 'inducing', 'behavior', 'lack', 'polish', 'suppose', 'show', 'intro', 'everything', 'need', 'know']",Samantha Brown's Asia

1388567,A3MBC0WNEAP7AS,B0047HXMJI,Leonard,"[4, 4]","Tokyo is my favorite city in the world, but there are hardly any good travel DVDs pertaining to Tokyo. I bought this DVD specifically because I wanted to see Tokyo, but the Japan episode sucked. Fortunately, the other episodes were pretty good.The Japan episode began in Kyoto (never mind the fact that Kyoto has 1/8 the population of Tokyo). If they wanted to start in a Japanese city other than Tokyo, at least choose Osaka. I liked the cherry blossoms. Alcoholic Samantha spent a large portion of the episode at a Sake bar. I learned that Kyoto was the birthplace of the Geisha. I enjoyed Samantha interviewing a Geisha. However, it was unnecessary for Samantha to dress up as a Geisha. That ate up a lot of time. She then went to a forest to find bamboo that would be turned into chopsticks (yawn). It's only fair that I point out that the Kyoto countryside was beautiful.Samantha took the Bullet Train to Tokyo. I enjoyed that part. However, she didn't show us much of Tokyo. There are a million things to do in Tokyo and she chose to go to a fish market to watch a fish get decapitated by a samurai sword. Then, she spent 5 minutes in an apartment playing with a kitten (I'm not making this up). She hardly showed us Tokyo. She didn't even visit the Ginza shopping district. The Japan episode was a disappointment.Hong Kong is another cool Asian city. She took the Star Ferry across Victoria Harbor. I was impressed with the views of the Hong Kong skyline. However, in typical Samantha Brown fashion, she chose to do the most mundane things in a foreign city. She first went shopping for clothes. She then made bamboo noodles (seriously, who does this on a vacation)? I liked her visit to the Temple Street Nightmarket. A fortune teller (correctly) said that she would eventually become pregnant.She went to the Peninsula Hotel for an afternoon tea. That was as fun as watching paint dry. I loved her trip on the cable car to Lantau Island. It was so scenic. She visited a decrepit fishing village and the famous Buddha statue. She also went mountain climbing. She participated in a dragon boat race. It wasn't my cup of tea, but at least it wasn't another trip to a restaurant. The Hong Kong portion of the episode concluded with Samantha watching the Hong Kong skyline's Symphony of Lights. That was epic!!!In Macau, she visited a spa (could've skipped that). Macau has some nice casinos. She climbed on the top of Macau Tower. That was scenic but scary. She then went to Margaret's restaurant and made Egg Tarts. Once again, she spent too much time at restaurants. I did enjoy a shot of this bridge in Macau (don't know the name of the bridge). I wish she mentioned how to get around Hong Kong (Hong Kong has a subway, but you wouldn't know that from watching this episode).Singapore was also included in this DVD. Prior to watching this DVD, I knew nothing about Singapore other than an American kid getting caned there for spraying graffiti on cars. The episode began with a nice shot of the Singapore skyline. The city has draconian rules- you get fined for chewing gum and not flushing toilets. Samantha went to two rival Laksa restaurants (Laksa is this dish that resembles soup). She spent too much time on the Laksa segment. Fortunately, the rest of the episode was much better.This episode showed the diversity of Singapore. At the Raffles Hotel she met an attractive Indian woman who agreed to show her around the city. Before they left the hotel, they enjoyed an alcoholic drink known as the Singapore Sling (Samantha should start attending AA meetings). They visited a mosque in a Muslim enclave known as Kampong Glam. I learned that Thomas Raffles, a British explorer who founded Singapore, urban planned the entire city. He designated neighborhoods for each ethnic group (Chinese, Indians, Malays, etc). They also visited Little India. Samantha even participated in a Hindu ceremony (I enjoyed this since it was a city-specific activity and not something trivial like a visit to a restaurant).Samantha took a boat to a remote island and for $2, rented a bike. She spoke to the village elder (via a translator). She also made Singapore's national dish, fish head curry. That scene was a little too gory. She visited Chinatown and went to an acupuncturist (could've skipped that- there are acupuncturists on every other block in Manhattan). Samantha spoke to members of the Peranakan (a hybrid Chinese, Malaysian, and Indian culture) and participated in their ceremony.I enjoyed her ride on a monorail to Sentosa Island. The island consists of an amusement park, mall, and man-made beach. Samantha even rode a go-kart. The episode concluded with a ride on the Singapore Flyer (an imitation of the London Eye). The Singapore episode was the best episode in the DVD. It more than made up for the mediocre Japan episode.",4,"Good, but could've been better",1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,4837,"['Tokyo', 'favorite', 'city', 'world', 'are', 'hardly', 'good', 'travel',
