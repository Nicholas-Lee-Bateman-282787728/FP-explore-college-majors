The film is one of the best live show I've seen.As Bret gets older its seems his shows get shorter. But it was still great. As with all the Poison shows not all the songs you like to hear are in it. As for the few cover songs Poison included I enjoyed them.Why not everyone thinks they can do a song better or just as good and they did. Would still love to see Poison put out an album with all new stuff. I enjoyed the Hollyweird album except for Squeeze Box. Keep up the good work boys, see ya soon.POISON'D!",5,Next best thing to being there,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,593,"['video', 'have', 'Just', 'being', 'back', 'show', 'see', 'year', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'live', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen.As', 'Bret', 'older', 'shows', 'get', 'shorter', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'Poison', 'not', 'songs', 'like', 'hear', 'are', 'few', 'cover', 'songs', 'Poison', 'included', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'do', 'song', 'better', 'just', 'good', 'did', 'Would', 'still', 'love', 'see', 'Poison', 'put', 'out', 'album', 'new', 'stuff', 'enjoyed', 'Hollyweird', 'album', 'Squeeze', 'Box', 'Keep', 'good', 'work', 'boys', 'see', 'ya', 'soon.POISON']","Poison - Live, Raw & Uncut"

Recording during the Poison'd tour in 2007 the dvd captures the whole experience of the Poison'd tour, having attended their one of the dates of the tour makes it even better for me. The cd is also very enjoyable, and probably Poison's best live cd so far. The only complaint is that the cd is missing a handful of songs that are on the dvd, but their only the cover songs.

I Wont Forget You, Talk Dirty To Me, and Nothin But A Good time are extra cool, loaded with energy.  The only song i didn't care for was ""I have every bone in your body except mine.""  CC needs to stick to playing great quality, energetic, and entertaining guitar rather than try to sing.
