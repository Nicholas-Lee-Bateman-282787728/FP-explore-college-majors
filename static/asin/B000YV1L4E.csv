The only thing I recommend is if you are new to yoga, research some of the poses first and find poses that you are able to do were you can get the most out of the workout without straining yourself. If you are looking to lose weight fast, I do not recommend this to you. Some of the poses are simple for a person who has been practicing yoga for quite sometime and is looking for a little more of a challenge. But if you are starting out, like me, and you are just looking for a little peace in your morning routine, this is something I would recommend to anybody.",5,Perfect!,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,1339,"['had', 'bought', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Yoga', 'beginners', 'was', 'skeptical', 'first', 'perfect', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'life', 'working', 'full', 'time', 'school', 'part', 'time', 'wedding', 'planning', 'other', 'misc', 'events', 'was', 'looking', 'yoga', 'calmed', 'mind', 'body', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'forever', 'complete', 'Losing', 'weight', 'secondary', 'benefit', 'bought', 'A.M.', 'yoga', 'are', '5', 'exercises', 'focusing', 'different', 'poses/exercises', 'five', 'are', 'broken', 'up', 'can', 'do', 'different', 'exercises', 'different', 'days', 'so', 'choose', 'one', 'day', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'flexible', 'yet', 'really', 'do', 'one', 'exercises', 'feel', 'ready', 'take', 'day', 'can', 'even', 'fit', 'hectic', 'schedule', 'more', '25', 'minutes', 'only', 'thing', 'recommend', 'are', 'new', 'yoga', 'research', 'poses', 'first', 'find', 'poses', 'are', 'able', 'do', 'were', 'can', 'get', 'most', 'workout', 'straining', 'are', 'looking', 'lose', 'weight', 'fast', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'poses', 'are', 'simple', 'person', 'who', 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'quite', 'sometime', 'looking', 'little', 'more', 'challenge', 'are', 'starting', 'out', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'little', 'peace', 'morning', 'routine', 'something', 'would', 'recommend', 'anybody']",A.M.

This DVD is exceptional for me in that 1) I feel wrung out of all toxins after each session, 2) the routines feel especially well structured leaving a special sense of wholeness and stability after moving through the sequenced poses Yee has choreographed, 3) the landscape of Arizona's red canyon is exquisite and nourishing for the eyes/soul/spirit during the practice, 4) the pacing and focus/grounding seems especially perfected among all his DVD practices. Each section is about 20 minutes and focuses on an entirely different pose type, yet after doing just one section your entire body feels well balanced and stabilized. Eventually, I will begin doing multiple segments at one sitting, but the idea is to work through all throughout the week so by week end each focus has been really worked. It's a great plan, transformative, should be part of preventative health programs everywhere. I mix it with Rodney Yee's Meditation DVD, which takes the bite out of urban living. I actually got up more than two hours earlier this morning to do his practice, since his intro requests you go to bed earlier and wake earlier and start each day with his practice. I'm feeling like that plan is an excellent program for long-term inner peace and productivity!

1120866,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000YV1L4E,,"[4, 4]","This DVD in essence contains five short (around 20 minute each) routines, each focusing on a different type of activity. There are standing, twists, backbends, forward, and hip openers. They are meant to be quick morning routines for the times you don't have more time for a more in depth yoga session. In addition you get an interview with Rodney Yee and the ability to change the vocal track from full to abbreviated.The routines were fairly easy, a good way to start a day. The backgrounds in western canyons were quite lovely.I do enjoy Rodney Yee a lot, so that was a plus.On the downside, first, there's a forced intro discussion that you have to skip past every single time you play the DVD. That's just silly. That could have been in there as an option on the main menu if you wanted to see it. There's no reason to watch that every single time you want to do a workout.Next, the routines don't warn you up front what you'll need for it. You're going along, enjoying the routine, and suddenly he pulls out a strap! If you weren't ready, you have to pause and run and get one. He does that with a block as well.He doesn't mirror you - what you see on the screen is the opposite of what you yourself are doing. While that doesn't matter for the more basic poses like tree pose, when he gets into the twists that makes things quite challenging. I would much rather have seen him mirror me.I like that at the end when he goes into ""relaxation pose"" (he won't call it Corpse Pose) that the music is quiet and then stays that way as the DVD goes around to the main menu again. With some DVDs you're laying there relaxing and then the DVD pops to energetic music which ruins the mood.I wish he'd done a more full job of describing some poses though. Even in the ""verbose"" version he is brief in helping you get into a position and it can be challenging to figure out exactly what he is looking for. Of course the brief version of the soundtrack is even worse :) By then you better have the routines memorized.Well recommended, but it'd be nice for them to tweak this a bit to work out some of the minor issues.",4,Good Short Basic Routines,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,2111,"['DVD', 'essence', 'contains', 'five', 'short', '20', 'minute', 'routines', 'focusing', 'different', 'type', 'activity', 'are', 'standing', 'twists', 'backbends', 'forward', 'hip', 'openers', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'quick', 'morning', 'routines', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'time', 'more', 'depth', 'yoga', 'session', 'addition', 'get', 'interview', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'ability', 'change', 'vocal', 'track', 'full', 'abbreviated.The', 'routines', 'were', 'fairly', 'easy', 'good', 'way', 'start', 'day', 'backgrounds', 'western', 'canyons', 'were', 'quite', 'lovely.I', 'do', 'enjoy', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'lot', 'was', 'plus.On', 'downside', 'first', 'forced', 'intro', 'discussion', 'have', 'skip', 'past', 'single', 'time', 'play', 'DVD', 'just', 'silly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'option', 'main', 'menu', 'wanted', 'see', 'reason', 'watch', 'single', 'time', 'want', 'do', 'workout.Next', 'routines', 'do', ""n't"", 'warn', 'up', 'front', 'what', ""'ll"", 'need', ""'re"", 'going', 'along', 'enjoying', 'routine', 'suddenly', 'out', 'strap', 'were', ""n't"", 'ready', 'have', 'pause', 'run', 'get', 'one', 'block', 'well.He', ""n't"", 'mirror', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'opposite', 'what', 'are', 'doing', ""n't"", 'matter', 'more', 'basic', 'poses', 'tree', 'pose', 'when', 'twists', 'things', 'quite', 'challenging', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'mirror', 'me.I', 'end', 'when', 'relaxation', 'pose', 'wo', ""n't"", 'call', 'Corpse', 'Pose', 'music', 'quiet', 'then', 'stays', 'way', 'DVD', 'around', 'main', 'menu', 'again', 'DVDs', ""'re"", 'laying', 'there', 'relaxing', 'then', 'DVD', 'pops', 'energetic', 'music', 'mood.I', 'wish', ""'d"", 'done', 'more', 'full', 'job', 'describing', 'poses', 'Even', 'verbose', 'version', 'brief', 'helping', 'get', 'position', 'can', 'be', 'challenging', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'looking', 'course', 'brief', 'version', 'soundtrack', 'even', 'worse', 'then', 'better', 'have', 'routines', 'memorized.Well', 'recommended', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'tweak', 'bit', 'work', 'out', 'minor', 'issues']",A.M.

1120867,AIJ35J53R6XV6,B000YV1L4E,,"[5, 6]","Rodney Yee has had some hits and some misses in his yoga DVDs but mostly the former, in my book. Despite the occasional DVD that did not work, I think of him as a wonderful teacher, in fact he is one of my favorites.I dont like philosophy mixed in with physical yoga. Because of the mind+body aspect of the origins of yoga, often a new age talk track accompanies the physical yoga on DVDs. The issue with this is that every teacher of yoga has their own interpretation of the philosophy behind yoga and frequently this seems, at least to me, very different from my own readings and interpretation. So although I think yoga is holistic, I dont find yoga DVDs of physical asana practice the best medium to impart simultaneous spiritual/philosophical ideology.One of the reasons I like Rodney Yee is that he sticks to physical yoga. His talk track is form and alignment cues. Yee usually has a minimalist instruction style that is best suited for those who have some prior experience of yoga and want a DVD to follow along but not to really ""learn"" yoga asana. Another reason I like Yee is that his yoga is ""classic"" and yet features interesting combinations.AM Yoga for your Week is a bit of a departure from Yee's minimal talk track style. He provides extensive and wonderfully helpful cues. Despite some years of yoga practise I discovered help with some sticky points from his cues in my forward bends. Full marks to the DVD for cueing. It should work well for beginners and beyond as its audience.Before I ordered the DVD I had read that each 20 minute session had a separate focus - twists, backbends, forward bends, standing poses, hip openers. I typically do longer sessions of yoga with a bit of everything for what I consider a balanced practise. Forward bends are effective counter poses to backbends and so on. I wondered how separating the focus would work. I find it works very well as put together by Yee. Yee sets up with prep work before getting into the deeper poses and finishes with asanas that work as effective counter poses although they are not the typical choices. Doing 20 minutes with a specific focus each day is working as well for me as doing a long session twice a week that incorporates all the categories.This DVD is particularly useful to busy people who cross train and want to do yoga apart from other forms of exercise like strength training and cardio. The 20 minute format is easy to tag on after another workout or as an independant yoga session in the morning if you do some other stuff in the evening.The special feature of an intervew with Yee was enjoyable. I have often worndered what attracted him to Yoga since he says so little in his other DVDs. Hearing him explain in his sincere and understated style was good.

1120869,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000YV1L4E,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[104, 111]","Rodney Yee, a veteran yoga instructor as well as the featured instructor of many yoga videos and DVDs, has recently released this new offering, AM Yoga for Your Week.  The intent was to provide five 20-minute practices (but note that the actual practice times vary from 22-26 minutes) which could be used during busy weekday mornings to get the day off to a good start.  In reality, these five excellent yoga sessions, each of which has a different focus, are appropriate for use at ANY time of the day.  Although each individual practice revolves around a specific body area/group of postures, each are well-rounded, stand-alone yoga sessions.  I have described the five practices briefly below.STANDING, 22.5 minutesStanding postures include standing forward bend, tree, triangle, side angle pose, warrior 1, and warrior 2; standing forward bend is performed in-between some of these poses.  The standing poses conclude with chair and wide-legged standing forward bend before moving to the floor for hero and then finishing in relaxation pose.  Yee offers some particularly nice form pointers while holding the standing poses.TWISTS, 26 minutesThis practice opens with a series of reclined twists (one of which uses a strap).  Yee then transitions to standing with down dog and standing forward bend for revolved prayer twist and crazy dog.  Coming back to seated in cobbler's pose, he performs a twist in wide-legged seated pose and two variations on Sage 3 posture.  This practice finishes with half Lord of the fishes, cobra, and relaxation pose.BACK BENDS, 25 minutesYee starts here by rolling two blankets together to create a bolster for under the upper back; he lies over this for a gentle lying backbend.  Coming to standing, he moves through a variation on sun salutations which include standing backbend, chair, down dog, warrior 2, side angle, warrior 1, and crescent lunge.  He then moves to the floor for cobra, bow, and camel.  After finishing with the backbending work, Yee nicely stretches out the body with cobbler's pose, simple seated twist, reclined leg stretch (using a strap if needed); he finished with relaxation pose.FORWARD BENDS, 24 minutesThis practice begins in a reclined position for a series of moves that felt more like hip openers than forward bends:  reclined leg stretch (using a strap if needed), happy babies pose, and thread-the-needle.  Next Yee gradually transitions to standing through child's pose, down dog, standing forward bend, wide angle standing forward bend, and 3-legged down dog.  Coming back to the floor for seated forward bends, he performs a simple cross-legged forward bend, head-to-knee pose, full seated forward bend, cobbler's forward bend, and wide-legged forward bend, finishing with a brief rest and then relaxation pose.  To my surprise, this segment was probably my favorite, as it had a great mix of postures.HIP OPENERS, 26 minutesThis segment uses a yoga block.  It starts with a seated opening vinyasa in which Yee flows from staff pose to cobbler's to wide-legged seated pose, gradually speeding this up and also adding half-boat pose.  He next does a simple cross-legged forward bend before incorporating the block.  Keeping one leg stretched straight out in front, he first rests the other knee on the block, then brings the knee out to the side at a right angle.  He also uses the block for cobbler's pose with the block between the feet.  Additional postures which follow include pigeon, revolved crescent lunge, double pigeon, half Lord of the fishes, wide-legged seated forward bend, and cobbler's forward bend.  The practice concludes with lightning pose, hero's pose on the block, and relaxation.Despite Yee's long history of making yoga videos, he has still managed to offer something that feels fresh and new here.  As always, his cueing is impeccable (although mirrored cueing would be even better!), and he offers wonderful form pointers which help you to get into the postures more deeply.

1120871,A26F5B12T242LL,B000YV1L4E,"Margaret P. ""mhp2027""","[12, 12]","This is my hands-down favorite DVD, but it does have one flaw. Fortunately, I've just foundYoga - Core Cross Train, which addresses the missing element of ""AM Yoga for Your Week.""AM Yoga contains five short workouts (around 25 minutes) suitable to do at home in the morning before you go to work. This is the only reliable time I have to exercise, and I simply don't have time for a 60 to 90 minute workout. Each of the five workouts focuses on one aspect of flexiblity, and each contains a secondary emphasis on strength using isometric exercises. The first is standing poses (for overall flexibility and balance), the second is forward bends (flexbility in your hamstrings and back), the third is for flexibility in the hips, the fourth is backbends to open your shoulders & upper back & chest, and the fifth is twists (looser movement).Taken together, these five workouts are almost (oh-so-close) to being ballanced. But after doing these AM Yoga workouts most mornings for about 6-months (yes, really!), I noticed that while most of my body felt better and more flexible, my upper back still felt relatively tense and inflexible and often tense by the end of the day. Intermediate workouts (e.g., focusing on the plow or headstand) focus on the right area, but there is a large jump in flexibility from AM Yoga to a headstand.  The missing element is present inYoga - Core Cross Train.

1120872,A2W4W1P1S0547T,B000YV1L4E,sobepeace,"[20, 21]","You won't find many surprises in these five 20-minute yoga sequences, just solid sequencing of bedrock poses--not a bad thing in my book. The pace of each practice is moderate, with medium length holds of poses (a possible exception is the repeated cycles within the hip opener sequence, which some may find a bit quick). Despite the short time frame and leisurely pace, each sequence manages to pack a surprisingly good selection of asanas within its particular theme: standing poses, twists, backbends, forward bends, or hip openers. The standing sequence is fairly standard, but each of the other series is more creative. Twist incorporates reclining, standing, and seated twists. The backbend sequence is dynamic and graceful. The forward bend sequence includes both standing and seated asanas. The hip opener series works repetitively and progressively. Sequences can be strung together for a longer practice, but only manually. The music is pleasant and unobtrusive, mostly wind instruments with some drums. The scenery is typical Gaiam-beautiful.I don't notice anything especially ""A.M."" about the sequences--they can each be done at any time. If anything, all but the more fluid backbend sequence could use a warm up, so time permitting, I do a few sun salutations first, or start with backbends when linking multiple sequences. The ""full instruction"" audio track assumes some knowledge of the asanas, and consists mostly of cues for moving between postures and helpful alignment reminders within each pose. There is also a ""minimal instruction"" audio track that is nice once the sequence is familiar. Some asanas reappear in a number of sequences, allowing for increased familiarity and progress over time. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Spanish language audio track as well, well translated and cued in a pleasant voice that matched Rodney Yee's own rather nicely.Overall, this is a decent addition to my yoga library, which I use mostly for quick fixes, lazy days, or as a stretch or cool down after a workout. I am an early intermediate yoga practitioner, but can see this being of use to most levels of practitioners, from slightly advanced beginners (those with basic familiarity of the asanas) on. Here is my best shot at an asana list, not including linking or repeated poses: STANDING SEQUENCE: Mountain, Standing Forward Bend, Down Dog, Lunge, Tree, Triangle, Standing Forward Bend, Side Angle, Warrior 1, Standing Forward Bend, Warrior 2, Wide Angle Standing Forward Bend, Chair, Hero, Relaxation.
