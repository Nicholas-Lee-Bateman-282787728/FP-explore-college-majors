Well acted & a quality production as well - so much better that many of the programs we see on TV today. And its cancellation by the NBC management (& I use the word 'management' very loosely), just goes to show that simpletons abound in the television industry like nowhere else. How many great shows have gone down the gurgler just because some TV executive suit lacked intelligence, had no comprehension whatsoever what constituted an excellent program, or who didn't have a brain at all. And all the time they like to tell us that they are dedicated to bringing us the high quality entertainment that we want to have & see. Well boys, 'Surface' WAS high quality entertainment, and judging by the other reviews for it, people not only wanted it, but they also enjoyed it. Duh!

I thought it was very imaginative and had a great look to it, real world stuff- not just computer FX. The characters were also generally interesting although I'd guess Lake Bell to be a little young for her character's apparent importance.I thought at the time that the writers were leaving a lot of unexplained bits and loose ends, maybe they were hoping for a longer run time for the series. I kept hoping that everything would be better explained but perhaps the ratings and the epxense of producing this show are what killed it. The series ends with a very chopped off/rushed sense to it because NBC didn't give them the time to finish the story, another 9 episodes (there are 15) would've helped out what is really a pretty good program. The money that will be wasted this fall on comedy shows or reality junk would have been far better spent giving us more of Surface- and probably have given the network better ratings. I would've loved to see more episodes, sure won't be anything to equal it this fall.There are deleted scenes for some episodes and one special effects minifeature inlcuded, none of this is captioned or subtitled. The scenes aren't just short little scraps but aren't very interesting, the featurette is worthwhile because it does tell the viewer a little about how they made the show. The episodes themselves look good but seem to be divided into only 4 or 5 chapters so if you feel the need to skip bits you'll have to use ffwd instead of the next button to get to your desired sections. I think this is the first TV series I've seen that is subtitled (if you want it- in English only) but not closed captioned, I'm sure the original broadcast was captioned which can be a big help if your hearing isn't good.",4,"Made most of what was on/will be on TV look bad, needed more airtime",1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,1828,"['Most', 'what', 'see', 'TV', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'days', 'Surface', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'imaginative', 'had', 'great', 'look', 'real', 'world', 'stuff-', 'not', 'just', 'computer', 'FX', 'characters', 'were', 'also', 'generally', 'interesting', ""'d"", 'guess', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'be', 'little', 'young', 'character', 'apparent', 'importance.I', 'thought', 'time', 'writers', 'were', 'leaving', 'lot', 'unexplained', 'bits', 'loose', 'ends', 'maybe', 'were', 'hoping', 'longer', 'run', 'time', 'series', 'kept', 'hoping', 'everything', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'explained', 'perhaps', 'ratings', 'epxense', 'producing', 'show', 'are', 'what', 'killed', 'series', 'very', 'chopped', 'off/rushed', 'sense', 'NBC', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'time', 'finish', 'story', '9', 'episodes', 'are', '15', 'would', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'program', 'money', 'will', 'be', 'wasted', 'fall', 'comedy', 'shows', 'reality', 'junk', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'spent', 'giving', 'more', 'Surface-', 'probably', 'have', 'given', 'network', 'better', 'ratings', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'episodes', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'anything', 'equal', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'one', 'special', 'effects', 'minifeature', 'inlcuded', 'none', 'captioned', 'subtitled', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'short', 'little', 'scraps', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'featurette', 'worthwhile', 'tell', 'viewer', 'little', 'how', 'made', 'show', 'episodes', 'look', 'good', 'seem', 'be', 'divided', 'only', '4', '5', 'chapters', 'so', 'feel', 'need', 'skip', 'bits', ""'ll"", 'have', 'use', 'ffwd', 'instead', 'next', 'button', 'get', 'desired', 'sections', 'think', 'first', 'TV', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'subtitled', 'want', 'it-', 'English', 'only', 'not', 'closed', 'captioned', ""'m"", 'sure', 'original', 'broadcast', 'was', 'captioned', 'can', 'be', 'big', 'help', 'hearing', ""n't"", 'good']",N/A

However, I have a life and cannot wait week-in and week-out for a program that I have to record because I do not know if I will be there at the correct time. Therefore, I waited for the series to finish and watched it through.The series stats off well with a had full of overlapping stories that is a little unnerving switching back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. Eventually you can get used to that. One story is of a boy and his pet, which is more interesting to him than girls are. The other is that of a young oceanographer that finds something of ""huge"" interest at the bottom of the ocean. She teams up with an insurance salesman who just happens to be a jack-of-all-trades and several times a blunt force.  They are perused by a mysterious figure working for a multi named cabal that is determined to keep the discovery secret even from the government.With each episode, we get a little more progress made towards the goal. In the mean time, we get to know the characters better. We may even fall in love with the boy's pet.Each episode has a cliffhanger for each of the sub stories. Moreover, just like the Saturday afternoon serials pulls everyone out of the fire at the last moment with some trick that we mortals never would have thought of (well art supposed to think of).In the end, if that what it was we are left almost as many nagging questions as we started with.

991552,A1D9V11QUHXENQ,B000FJH5M2,"Big Al ""Alan Rivire""","[3, 3]","*Spoiler Alert* This review may contain spoilers.Surface is a sci-fi TV series originally broadcasted on NBC in late 2005 and early 2006, under the name ""Fathom"". The show was suspended due to the 2006 Winter Olympics and subsequently canceled by the network a few months later, after one season and a mere 15 episodes. It is the story of a marine biologist Laura Daughtery (Lake Bell) and an insurance adjuster Richard Connelly (Jay Ferguson), who become obsessed with the truth, after they encounter a new species of gigantic sea monsters never seen before.  As a consequence, they are being pursued relentlessly by a federal official David Lee (Ian Dale). Eventually, they discover that Lee is in fact an agent of a secret organization, which appears to be responsible for the existence of the sea-monsters. Along the main plot is the story of a teenage boy Miles Barnett (Carter Jenkins), who wreaks havoc on his family and his hometown after he hatches an egg of a sea monster and raises it as a pet, which he calls Nim.The plot is slow moving at first, filled with story-lines of family relationships and teenage antics commonly found in day-time soap operas, but the plot starts to pick up after ""the cat is out of the bag"", cumulating in the protagonists crossing paths in the season finale, when Laura proclaims, ""It is a new world"", while she and her companions survey the ecological devastation by a gigantic sea-quake and the subsequent tsunami caused by the activities of the hordes of sea-monsters on the sea-floor. Like all sci-fi movies, the show requires viewers to temporarily suspend disbelief, but the love developed between Miles and his monster pet Nim, which purrs like a cat, is pushing the limit of credulity. The series is well scripted, directed and acted, with more secret revealed at the passing of each episode, leaving the viewers to crave for more, and the special effects are passable, but the abrupt cancellation of the series leaves the story hanging with too many loose threads.

The show originally aired on NBC and was heavily promoted but was unable to garner decent ratings before being relegated to the Sci-Fi Channel. Surface's creators gambled on a lack of recognizable names in the cast in favour of expensive production values and an emphasis on plot and exposition.Surface is the brainchild of the Pate brothers who openly acknowledged that their short-lived show was a pastiche of Steven Spielberg influences, most significantly Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extraterrestrial.Surface is certainly well-made with interesting characters and an engaging cast breathing life into them, in particular the actors who play Rich and Laura. Rich is reminiscent of Richard Dreyfuss' character in Close Encounters. After his alien encounter he becomes so obsessed with understanding what happened to his brother and finding these aliens that he abandons his family and befriends Laura because she has had a similar experience. Laura's a smart, tough oceanographer that initially evokes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's character in The Abyss (1989). Laura Bell plays her as confident and proactive but also vulnerable thanks to the presence of her young son who helps humanize her character.What's interesting about Surface is that, unlike Invasion, the scope of the show is global with scenes of other alien encounters taking place in Australia and South Africa but with a definite focus on events in the United States as that's where the main characters reside.

No fault of the actors playing the roles, they were just written and directed that way. The 14 year old boy who falls in love with a mini-version of the monster, manages to capture only the worst of a long series of teen-age players. His buddy and his own family come in just behind him for ability to irritate. Then there is the older version, the Good Ole Boy, who sees his brother killed by the full sized monster (it happens early on and knowing the fact is part of what one is supposed to know throughout the rest) and is haunted thereafter by sounds of his  brothers voice. Finally, in many ways worst of all, is the star, a quite good looking young woman, a Ph.D in marine biology, with a child to support, who appears to have learned nothing other than her science and to have no sense of responsibility save to herself (pity the poor kid).Early on I began rooting against all of them, but I cannot rightfully speak of their ultimate fate.The story is a typical monsters who can change the world epic...but, other than the human interest elements, is pretty well done.

In the beginning, each character has a unique experience with a new undersea lifeform and, over time, they are all drawn together.The boy, Miles (played by Carter Jenkins), essentially carries the show.  He finds an egg in the water, takes it home to the family fishtank and gets an interesting and dangerous new pet with which he shares a unique bond.  His relationship with the creature is believable, interesting and also touching.  The marine biologist, Laura (played by Lake Bell), and the insurance salesman, Rich (played by Jay Ferguson), come together quickly in the show and they both do a decent job but, as one reviewer said, Jay Ferguson comes off a bit like a graduate of the David Hasselhoff School of Acting.  His southern accent doesn't help his case.  To paraphrase Stephen Colbert--who's from the south but didn't want to sound like it--""You might have a southern accent AND be smart, but you sure won't sound like it.""  That was from a serious interview with CBS Sunday Morning.At certain points, the show did get a bit slow, particulary when Laura and Rich were checking things out in a homemade diving bell, but the show changes scenes frequently enough that you won't feel too bogged down.What I loved about this show is that it really shows you what a deep, dark and creepy place the ocean really can be, especially with MONSTROUS creatures swimming around in it.  ""Surface"" pretty much gave me all I could have wanted in a sea-monster story.  Did I get to see a COLOSSAL sea creature rise up from the deep and swallow a boat?  Yup.  Did I get to see hundreds of freaky creatures swimming in the deep?  Yup.  Did I get to see a hole in a lake swallow up everything and drain out all the water.  Sure did.  Watching ""Surface"" will make you think twice about going deep-sea fishing, or even swimming near the shore.Several episodes in, the ""previously on 'Surface'"" recaps begin, but instead of just having relevant clips patched together, there's a voiceover by, I believe, someone by the name of Joe Cipriano, who has an odd voice.  This isn't detrimental to the show, but I did find the voiceover interesting.This show, likeInvasion - The Complete Series, had a great storyline, great implementation, good special effects and a decent cast.

For me, the fact that the young boy's relationship with a member of the new species was so different than most other people's relationships with them was thought provoking in terms of compassion and care versus fright and fight.The plot had a good many surprising twists and illuminated biology, technology, gene manipulation, history, and education.This series was fun, entertaining, gripping off and on, and it was so enjoyable to watch the show and the characters develop.

The main guy had an encounter with the creatures so now he finds himself drawing pictures and making models. He also finds himself losing his family due to being too obsessed with what's in the water. Does that sound just a little like Close Encounters ? While I'm going to remember one of it's most silly scenes for a long long time. It goes like this, they are on a raft and sharks are around them. The brainy women scientist says ""yell, you'll scare the sharks away"". I wonder how quick I'd die if I tried that one in person. Oh also there's some wannabe E.T. stuff in here too and a kid named Miles finds one of the creatures and gets a connection with it like Elliot did with E.T. Well except here Miles starts to get the creatures powers.I found the show silly and stupid...yet I couldn't wait for it to come on every week! It still managed to be good tv and make me want to see what would happen next. I also admit that I loved the creature Miles found named Nihm. Their relationship was still touching and one of the better things about the show.The show had better, more original ideas after awhile and the finale did leave me a little curious to what would happen next.

I loved how it wasn't just the normal fluff that most TV shows seem to be.  There were deeper levels, multiple levels, and covered more than just some single core family.  The pace they unwound things and the story unfolded was probably half of the problem though, because it seems the public is enamored of fast, glitzy flash rather than a more solid story.  Between that and the timing, since there were several ""invasion"" shows on at the same time, I don't think it had much of a chance.Which is a shame since it told a very engaging story, had a great score, very subtle but breaking at just the right times.Acting was actually better than most of those freshmen invasion series had, most of the actors doing a good job.But like most of the non standard fare out there, this one didn't make it past season one.

It was almost as if once it was time for the story to evolve and provide resolution, the writers/producers couldn't agree on a direction to go.A few stylistics issues:1.) Lake Bell has a real interesting look and being quasi-hot, I can't understand why Laura was written as essentially an asexual character?2.) Leighton Meester (pre-Gossip Girl) the bad/good sister of Miles, other than occasional ""eye candy"" added very little3.) It was left un-resolved as to whether Jackson (the rich semi-retired treasure hunter played by Austin Nicholls) was working with the ""bad guys"" or not?Bottom-line, Surface is excellent entertainment value at less than a ""ten-spot"".

991586,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FJH5M2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","""Lost"" was a mega-hit during the 2004-2005 television season and imitation is not only the sincerest form of flattery, it is the highest level of cognitive reasoning of which most network executives are capable.  Consequently, we were not surprised that three networks came up with alien invasion television series (apparently they could not figure out how to rip-off ""Lost,"" so they decided just to go back and rip-off ""The X-Files"").  ABC had ""Invasion,"" CBS had ""Threshold,"" and NBC had ""Surface.""  I watched all three of the series and it turned out that the more I liked a series, the quicker it went off the air.  ""Invasion"" got through an entire series of 22 episodes, ""Surface"" got to air 15 episodes before its season ending cliffhanger became the final episode, and ""Threshold"" only aired nine of 14 episodes.  That might it the one of the three shows available as a ""complete series"" DVD (Say it now and say it loud, we got cancelled and we want you to keep watching!), but all things considered it is ""Surface"" that best bears watching again.Created by Josh and Jonas Pate, the premise of ""Surface"" is that what appears to be a mysterious new form of sea life starts popping up all over the earth with significant consequences for the show's main characters.  Dr. Laura Daughtery (Lake Bell, who left being a minor player on ""Boston Legal"" to helm this ship), a young oceanographer who is the first person to discover the new life forms at the bottom of the sea.  Then there is Richard Connelly (Jay R. Ferguson), an insurance salesman from Louisiana who loses his brother to one of the creatures while scuba diving.  Of course nobody believes either of these people, so it is a good thing they link up fairly early in the series.  Meanwhile, young Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins), finds a strange looking egg and brings it home, where it hatches and gives the boy a secret pet he names Nimrod.  There is also Dr. Aleksander Cirko (Rade Sherbedgia), the government scientist who apparently knows about the sea creatures, and who gets in the way of Laura and Rich from finding out more about the creatures.It takes ""The Complete Series"" for the three main characters to finally get together, where we see that being left high and dry is not necessarily a bad thing (Episode 15; apparently there was no money in the budget for episode titles), so for most of the season we have the major plot threads of Laura and Rich on the one hand, and Miles and Nimrod on the other, with the efforts of the government to contain the situation weaving in and out.  Overall, the Miles part of the story was more interesting, not only because it has the whole boy and his alien resonance of ""E.T.,"" but because I liked the developing relationship between Miles and his older sister Savannah (Leighton Meester).  It starts off as you standard older sister who cannot stand her baby brother bit, especially when Nimrod escapes at her party (Episode 2), but she ends up being the one family member that stands by him and his obsession (Episode 10).  Plus Miles has his friend Phil (Eddie Hassell), who stands by him even while warning him how dangerous everything is gong to be.Ironically, the Dr. Laura part of the story is the least interesting element, even though she is clearly supposed to be the show's star.  This could simply be because she is in the familiar role of the person trying to prove ""there is something out there,"" while Rich has the advantage of being a guy in way over his head.  But a brother being killed in front of him makes him the haunted figure in the series, which is more compelling that Laura having the government out to get here.  Plus she has the job of having to explain everything every time Rich wants to know what the hell they are seeing, what the hell is going on, what the hell should they do next, so on and so forth.  Watching this guy try to keep up with everything that is happening is clearly the position that most viewers can identify with, and Laura is handicapped by the fact that she cannot be smarter than the people out to get her or the premise of the series goes out the window.There was a major fatal flaw to ""Surface,"" namely the idea that the government is going to be able to cover up giant sea monsters attacking all over the world.  After all, we live in a world where CNN usually manages to get to everything before the federal government, so keep sea monsters off the news is going to be impossible, especially since the big beasties have minds of their own.  So every time Dr. Cirko and his head henchman Davis Lee (Ian Anthony Dale) try to control the situation I just have to roll my eyes.  This becomes a major problem for the series, because once word gets out, then it does not get to be about just these three characters, and since the sea beasties are a lot more active than the aliens on ""The X-Files"" the basic premise becomes rather untenable.  So I am not at all sure about where they were going to go with a second season given where the show ends (or even if the cliffhanger was what they always intended or a desperate ploy to get the show renewed).  But this problematic element is another reason that the Miles-Nimrod plotline was the best part of the show, because it was the part of the story least affected by the big picture.",4,"""Something is

I so enjoyed the series when it aired and was devastated that it was not renewed, but ecstatic when I found out that it, as well as Threshold and Invasion, was released on DVD. Someone called it a roller coaster ride and I think that is an accurate description. Someone also suggested a movie to give us some closure. What did those manmade creatures end up doing to our world? I am sure the creators had more in store than just a tsunami, but what?? The series did a good job pleasing would-be scientists with Rich and Laura trying to discover where these creatures came from, and the younger viewers with the partnership between Miles, his friend (whose name I forget) and Nimrod. I did kind of get ticked off at the abrupt switches of the storyline from kids to adults and back again, but it sure kept boredom at bay. While Rich and Laura made a good team, I did find Rich's character tended to be too violent, but he never backed down either. The disks played beautifully with no pauses, and if you chose to view each disk one episode at a time, the next episode was automatically set up at the end of the previous one so all you needed to do was press Play.

The fall of 2005 saw a surge of similarly themed programs such as Threshold, Invasion, and of course Surface being reviewed here.Unlike Lost, Surface lasted only one season (15-episodes), all of which are contained within the Universal Studios 4-disc DVD boxset.The show seems to liberally apply the term ""Spielbergian suspense"" in describing its themes and tones; a comparison that is fairly accurate early on but steadily degenerates as the show progresses to include some far reaching conspiracy theories and science that is often questionable at best.This primetime drama actually uses several characters (of different age groups and parts of the world), all sharing similar encounters with an odd aquatic creature, to weave its prose. In a nutshell it works pretty well from the get-go.  In fact the pilot is, in my opinion, the strongest offering of the entire series; which grows steadily more unbelievable with each episode subsequent.  Add some government conspiracies, a few hundred twists and turns and a plot that walks the line from ambitious to preposterous with annoying regularity and have a pretty clear idea of what Surface brings to the proverbial table.Created by twin brother writer-producer-directors Josh and Jonas Pate, the show stars lanky Lake Bell (could a more perfect name for a show about water monsters have been chosen? I think not) as protagonist oceanographer Laura Daughtery who discovers some odd formations on the ocean floor.  Meanwhile, a Louisiana-based insurance salesman, Rich (Jay R. Ferguson), witnesses the death of his brother by a massive marine creature, and finally 14-year-old Miles (Carter Jenkins) who, in addition to perpetually needing a haircut, raises one of the mysterious specimens after hatching it from an egg in his parents' aquarium.Throughout all this, scientists, national security agents and high school high-jinx abound. In fact I'm a subscriber to the theory that some of the show's most genuine (and humorous) moments stem from the school-kids' antics rather than the heavy-handedness that surrounds many of the adult story threads.About my biggest complaint comes in the form of the oft-unrealistic science/ physics.  I realize this is only supposed to be entertainment and all but certain threads are so unrealistic that the corresponding realism throughout the entire series suffers (the whole descending to 5000 feet in an oil drum then ascending in a mater of minutes without getting the bends is just one of dozens of moments that could make a viewer with even only a moderate IQ cringe).Additionally, by the final episode of the show, you get the distinct feeling that the writers simply lost their way as to what made the show so enjoyable initially.  As the tale got bigger, richer and more-revealed, it naturally lost its personable moments and while it never made it to a second season (making such concerns moot), it seems to me that the show would have followed a very different path from the first season; one dealing with apocalyptic themes and humans with near-superhero abilities.In the end the viewer comes away from the Surface experience with mixed emotions.  It certainly showed promise, especially in the beginning, the likes of which I would consider vastly superior to the drudgery of Lost in fact.  However, things do deteriorate as the show progresses and by the time all is said and done, the initial feeling that it was a travesty not to renew the series after its first season pretty much dissipates and is replaced with a truly odd sort of twisted logic: Is it possible for once the network execs got it right?",3,An Enjoyable Series But Not Without Its Flaws,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,3759,"['Love', 'hate', 'Lost', 'was', 'responsible', 'inspiring', 'whole', 'host', 'science', 'fiction', 'laced', 'network', 'television', 'dramas', 'most', '2000', 'fall', '2005', 'saw', 'surge', 'similarly', 'themed', 'programs', 'such', 'Threshold', 'Invasion', 'course', 'Surface', 'being', 'reviewed', 'here.Unlike', 'Lost', 'Surface', 'lasted', 'only', 'one', 'season', '15-episodes', 'are', 'contained', 'Universal', 'Studios', '4-disc', 'DVD', 'boxset.The', 'show', 'liberally', 'apply', 'term', 'Spielbergian', 'suspense', 'describing', 'themes', 'tones', 'comparison', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'early', 'steadily', 'show', 'include', 'far', 'reaching', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'science', 'often', 'questionable', 'best.This', 'primetime', 'drama', 'actually', 'several', 'characters', 'different', 'age', 'groups', 'parts', 'world', 'sharing', 'similar', 'encounters', 'odd', 'aquatic', 'creature', 'weave', 'prose', 'nutshell', 'pretty', 'well', 'get-go', 'fact', 'pilot', 'opinion', 'strongest', 'offering', 'entire', 'series', 'steadily', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'episode', 'subsequent', 'Add', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'few', 'hundred', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'line', 'ambitious', 'preposterous', 'annoying', 'regularity', 'have', 'pretty', 'clear', 'idea', 'what', 'Surface', 'proverbial', 'table.Created', 'twin', 'brother', 'writer-producer-directors', 'Josh', 'Jonas', 'Pate', 'show', 'lanky', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'could', 'more', 'perfect', 'name', 'show', 'water', 'monsters', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'think', 'not', 'protagonist', 'Laura', 'Daughtery', 'who', 'odd', 'formations', 'ocean', 'floor', 'Meanwhile', 'Louisiana-based', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'Rich', 'Jay', 'R.', 'Ferguson', 'death', 'brother', 'massive', 'marine', 'creature', 'finally', '14-year-old', 'Miles', 'Carter', 'Jenkins', 'who', 'addition', 'perpetually', 'needing', 'haircut', 'one', 'mysterious', 'specimens', 'hatching', 'egg', 'parents', 'scientists', 'national', 'security', 'agents', 'high', 'school', 'high-jinx', 'abound', 'fact', ""'m"", 'subscriber', 'theory', 'show', 'most', 'genuine', 'humorous', 'moments', 'stem', 'school-kids', 'antics', 'rather', 'heavy-handedness', 'many', 'adult', 'story', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'form', 'oft-unrealistic', 'science/', 'physics', 'realize', 'only', 'supposed', 'be', 'entertainment', 'certain', 'threads', 'are', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'corresponding', 'realism', 'entire', 'series', 'suffers', 'whole', 'descending', '5000', 'feet', 'oil', 'drum', 'then', 'ascending', 'mater', 'minutes', 'getting', 'bends', 'just', 'one', 'dozens', 'moments', 'could', 'make', 'viewer', 'even', 'only', 'moderate', 'IQ', 'cringe', '.Additionally', 'final', 'episode', 'show', 'get', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'writers', 'simply', 'lost', 'way', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'initially', 'tale', 'got', 'bigger', 'richer', 'more-revealed', 'naturally', 'lost', 'personable', 'moments', 'never', 'made', 'second', 'season', 'making', 'such', 'concerns', 'moot', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'followed', 'very', 'different', 'path', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'dealing', 'apocalyptic', 'themes', 'humans', 'near-superhero', 'abilities.In', 'end', 'viewer', 'away', 'Surface', 'experience', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'certainly', 'showed', 'promise', 'especially', 'beginning', 'likes', 'would', 'consider', 'vastly', 'superior', 'drudgery', 'Lost', 'fact', 'However', 'things', 'do', 'deteriorate', 'show', 'time', 'said', 'done', 'initial', 'feeling', 'was', 'travesty', 'not', 'renew', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'pretty', 'much', 'dissipates', 'replaced', 'truly', 'odd', 'sort', 'twisted', 'logic', 'possible', 'once', 'network', 'execs', 'got', 'right']",N/A

There are two stories occurring in parallel; scientist Laura Daughtry and a survivor of one of the first sea creature attacks, Rich, and Miles and his pet sea creature, Nim.  Daughtry and Rich are trying to find the creatures and expose them to the world and in the process, become embroiled in a government conspiracy.  Miles finds are raises one of the sea creatures and becomes almost symbiotically attached to it.  The Daughtry and Rich storyline is great and is reminiscent of some of the better X-Files story arcs.  The storyline with Miles is pretty weak and Miles comes off as an annoying kid that continually does the stupidest things.  Nonetheless, the story line is important to the overall plot.  The show didn't survive a shortened first season, no doubt because TV networks would rather sink a few grand on reality shows with stupid and boring people, instead of investing in great shows like Surface.

But I later watched the DVD sets of Invasion and Threshold and found then to be enjoyable. 'Invasion' took too long to get to the point in it's first season and was no doubt the reason why it failed for find an audience. 'Threshold' was obviously aimed at an older and brighter audience that it failed to attract.  The number of positive comments here on Amazon led me to try the Surface DVD set. Big mistake. 'Surface' is a series that has all the earmarks of a network's attempt to adjust the story to attract an audience, and failed. To watch all 15 episodes is an agonizing experience. I hoped that the series would find it's feet as it's production cycle matured but this was not to be the case.'Surface' had a lot of possibilities for story but was hampered from the start by poor production values, terrible acting, and undeveloped story lines.  The first half of the season seemed to be inhabited by irritating teenagers, clueless parents, teen girls who parade around all day in tiny bikinis, and Lake Bell's chest. The only interested adult characters are killed off in episode 6. The science behind the basic story is interesting at first because the lack of explanation makes the viewer wonder where this is all heading. Then we get a period of production changes beginning in episode 6. Realizing that the series was failing, the producer's attempted to alter the tone and direction of the series. Characters are either killed or minimized, personalities are changed, and Lake Bell begins to wear shirts. Worse yet, the science becomes incredulously unbelievable. As you watch episodes 8 and 9 and ponder the story of Laura and Rich's adventures in their homemade submersible, try not to laugh out loud at the ridiculousness of it all. If the very idea of being able to build a backyard bathysphere does not make you giggle, watch and think about how the plot rescues our characters from disaster.'Invasion' and 'Threshold' were decent, if failed attempts, of TV networks trying to enter the SciFi television market and are worth a second look. 'Surface' is not.  It is the kind of production that makes one understand why network execs are often reluctant to invest in SF television. It is the kind of series that also illustrates how remarkably good SciFi television programs like 'Battlestar Galactica' are in comparison.Don't waste your money on this one.

Unfortunately, GOFS isn't good enough anymore; hence the cancellation of this most excellent series.  Nevertheless, the series is out on DVD and for a while you, the viewer, can enjoy 40+ minutes per episode of a show touching on ET, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and The X-Files.Though rough on it's edges, rarely does a first season show not reveal a few, ""Surface"" combined excellent storytelling, good on-screen chemistry, and exceptional plotlines to have been a unique series--not an easy thing in today's market.The writing and producing of Josh and Jonah Pate predicate a bright future for these gentlemen. From the moment their series opens with the audience meeting Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) to the finale onto of a church, the brothers prove they have the ""chops"" to tell a good story and entertain an audience as evident with this quote:""Endangered species don't deserve to be on the brink of extension. But they are. You are a marine biologist. You of all people must know, that life is not fair.""  However, the writing is only part of the story.  The cast's on-screen chemistry is what brings the audience.Jay R. Ferguson (Rich), Lake Bell (""D""), and Carter Jenkins (Miles) do a good job showing they enjoyed making the series.  Whether it is the brother-sister conflicts or a clash of personalities, the viewer can't helped but be carried into the near-real life situations they face: filial and familial fights, life and death, faith and doubt to name a few place they take us, the viewer.  But what brings it all together and has the audience to sit down and watch the show, it is the exceptional plot.Given what new series are constantly doing to garner a demographic, the Pate Bros. went above and beyond.

991622,AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,B000FJH5M2,Steven Herring,"[1, 1]","In 2005 the three major networks all tried their hand at a new scifi series. What became of that was Surface, Threshold, and Invasion. Surface was NBC's experimental new drama. It was promoted sort of like a Spielbergian type thriller. It does have alot of suspense, but more often than not it ruins that suspense by actually showing you the monster. I can't help but think that the suspense was hurt by the almost constant screen time of the monster. You see the monster in the pilot and every subsequent episode. Due to the fact that there was very little suspense about the creature itself the mystery revolved around the people that are trying to cover it up. The only problem with that is it took a few episodes to get the whole government coverup plot to really kick in.There are three different plotlines that control the story. Doctor Daughtery is the protagonist. She is the scientist that first discovers the species and then subsequently must be silenced by the government agency. Rich is the second plot thread. His brother is killed by the monster and he sets out to find out the origin of this monster. Eventually these two meet and go on a mission to get real proof of the monster and show it to the world. These two characters are quite interesting and they both have their own reason for wanting the truth. These two actors work well together and have great chemistry throughout the series. I can't help but think that if there was a second season these two would have hooked up.The final plot line is the most interesting and annoying at the same time. A boy named Miles finds an egg of the species and grows it in his backyard. As it gets bigger he has to try and find ways to hide it from his family. That is the annoying part of the story. He constantly is just moving the creature and it just feels a little monatonous. After a few episodes though his story does get more interesting as his pet is given a wider view to the public. It evolves into the most interesting story as it is filled with alot of emotion. The relationship between Miles and Nim is not that far from Elliot and ET. Another Speilberg referance I know, but it seems fitting.The special effects in the series are pretty poor and could've used a big movie budget. I don't blame NBC because the creature gets alot of screen time so it would have been really expensive to make movie quality CGI. The main problem with the mosters is not how they look, but what they do. From Miles perspective the creatures are caring misunderstood creatures, but from the perspective of their victims is of course different. You don't know whether to fear the monsters or cuddle with them. It just confuses the audience as to what side to be on.The show itself suffers from a slow start. The first few episodes sort of feel like a jaws movie. That's not bad per say but the whole monster in the deep has been a little over done. The rest of the series deals with the aftermath of the monsters existance and starts to delve into where they came from. This is much more riveting then the latter.Overall the show is a decent scifi series. It isn't a standout in a densly packed genre, but in the end it is an exciting and fresh look at the sea monster plot. The series does leave on a cliffhangar, but it is nothing too serious. The show was cancelled and all the mysteries are left up to interpretation. Surface is not perfect it had some trouble finding it's footing early on, but as the season went on it got better and better. If your a scifi fan you should give this series a try along with the other series mentioned above.

991625,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B000FJH5M2,Terry Sunday,"[2, 3]","""Surface"" was one of three short-lived, water-themed science-fiction series that ran on network television in 2005 and lasted less than one season (the others were ""Invasion"" and ""Threshold""). Since I seem to have a fetish for doomed programs, such as ""Firefly,"" ""The Lone Gunmen"" and ""The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.,"" among others, I decided to give this DVD of the entire series a chance, even though I never saw ""Surface"" when it aired.Well, the best I can say is it's okay. The story starts on a fairly promising note as an ecological mystery when a huge, unknown creature appears in the Gulf of Mexico and strange eggs show up off the East Coast of the U.S. We meet the main characters early on, and therein lies one of the show's problems. To me, the characters are not interesting, well-developed or believable. They're all practically caricatures--the &uuml;ber-geeky high-school kid and his dopey sidekick; his popular, snotty cheerleader sister; their self-absorbed, distracted, yuppie parents; the frantic, overachieving single-mom biologist searching for the creatures; the emotional, ""everyman"" insurance agent who hooks up with her; the shadowy, mysterious government agent pursuing them. They're all just too pat for words.The special effects range from poor to fair, with the creatures at the lower end of the scale. Some of the scene-extension CGI shots are not too bad. Sure, it's a TV show and not a major motion picture, but that's still no excuse for screening things that resemble plastic puppets. If the CGI isn't up to par--which it definitely isn't--then show the creatures in darkness or through fog or something. Most of the scenes of Nimrod (the infant creature) are really not up to the standards of the time. And, strangely for a show that takes place largely in and around the ocean, the water FX are really pretty bad.Like most modern shows, the audio in ""Surface"" is awful. It has perhaps the widest and most annoying volume level range of any DVD I've watched recently, from barely audible whispers or important background conversations that advance the plot to ear-splitting noises that almost blow the speakers out. I had to crank the volume down low and turn on the subtitles. Can't anyone make shows these days with a relatively constant volume level? I guess not.To its credit, the 15 episodes in the short season do tell a complete story rather than just cut off with a cliffhanger non-ending as some cancelled shows do. On the other hand, the final episode that more-or-less wraps everything up is rushed, frenetic and implausible (as if giant, genetically engineered, electricity-producing, intelligent sea creatures aren't implausible?). The last episode would be a lot shorter if the characters didn't repeat themselves at interminable length (""Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on."" and ""Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.""). Whoever wrote the dialog must have run out of ideas and needed to fill up the time somehow.So I guess I'm not surprised the network pulled the plug on ""Surface"" after less than one season. It clearly lacked the staying power of ""The X-Files"" or ""Fringe,"" and remains just a footnote in the history of broadcast TV sci-fi shows. I thought this DVD set was worth watching once, and Amazon's low price made it an attractive buy, but I can't honestly say I found it any better than mediocre.",3,There's No Real Mystery Why It Didn't Last,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,3366,"['Surface', 'was', 'one', 'three', 'short-lived', 'water-themed', 'science-fiction', 'series', 'ran', 'network', 'television', '2005', 'lasted', 'less', 'one', 'season', 'others', 'were', 'Invasion', 'Threshold', 'seem', 'have', 'fetish', 'doomed', 'programs', 'such', 'Firefly', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'Adventures', 'Brisco', 'County', 'Jr.', 'others', 'decided', 'give', 'DVD', 'entire', 'series', 'chance', 'even', 'never', 'saw', 'Surface', 'when', 'aired.Well', 'best', 'can', 'say', 'okay', 'story', 'fairly', 'promising', 'note', 'ecological', 'mystery', 'when', 'huge', 'unknown', 'creature', 'Gulf', 'Mexico', 'strange', 'eggs', 'show', 'up', 'off', 'East', 'Coast', 'U.S.', 'meet', 'main', 'characters', 'early', 'therein', 'one', 'show', 'problems', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'well-developed', 'believable', ""'re"", 'practically', 'caricatures', 'uuml', 'ber-geeky', 'high-school', 'kid', 'dopey', 'sidekick', 'popular', 'snotty', 'cheerleader', 'sister', 'self-absorbed', 'distracted', 'yuppie', 'parents', 'frantic', 'overachieving', 'single-mom', 'biologist', 'searching', 'creatures', 'emotional', 'everyman', 'insurance', 'agent', 'who', 'up', 'shadowy', 'mysterious', 'government', 'agent', 'pursuing', ""'re"", 'just', 'too', 'pat', 'words.The', 'special', 'effects', 'range', 'poor', 'fair', 'creatures', 'lower', 'end', 'scale', 'scene-extension', 'CGI', 'shots', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'Sure', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'still', 'excuse', 'screening', 'things', 'resemble', 'plastic', 'puppets', 'CGI', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'then', 'show', 'creatures', 'darkness', 'fog', 'something', 'Most', 'scenes', 'Nimrod', 'infant', 'creature', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'standards', 'time', 'strangely', 'show', 'place', 'largely', 'ocean', 'water', 'FX', 'are', 'really', 'pretty', 'most', 'modern', 'shows', 'audio', 'Surface', 'awful', 'perhaps', 'widest', 'most', 'annoying', 'volume', 'level', 'range', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'recently', 'barely', 'audible', 'whispers', 'important', 'background', 'conversations', 'advance', 'plot', 'ear-splitting', 'noises', 'almost', 'speakers', 'out', 'had', 'crank', 'volume', 'down', 'low', 'turn', 'subtitles', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'make', 'days', 'relatively', 'constant', 'volume', 'level', 'guess', 'credit', '15', 'episodes', 'short', 'season', 'do', 'tell', 'complete', 'story', 'rather', 'just', 'cut', 'off', 'cliffhanger', 'non-ending', 'cancelled', 'shows', 'do', 'other', 'hand', 'final', 'episode', 'more-or-less', 'wraps', 'everything', 'up', 'rushed', 'frenetic', 'implausible', 'giant', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'electricity-producing', 'intelligent', 'sea', 'creatures', 'are', ""n't"", 'implausible', 'last', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'shorter', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'interminable', 'length', 'Come', 'Come', 'Come', 'Come', 'Come', 'Wait', 'Wait', 'Wait', 'Wait', 'Wait.', 'wrote', 'dialog', 'must', 'have', 'run', 'ideas', 'needed', 'fill', 'up', 'time', 'somehow.So', 'guess', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'network', 'pulled', 'plug', 'Surface', 'less', 'one', 'season', 'clearly', 'lacked', 'staying', 'power', 'X-Files', 'Fringe', 'just', 'footnote', 'history', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'sci-fi', 'shows', 'thought', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'Amazon', 'low', 'price', 'made', 'attractive', 'buy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'say', 'found', 'better', 'mediocre']",N/A

Ayers,"[5, 6]","We need stories to give us perspective, and certain stories can resonate so greatly that they influence and direct an entire culture for possibly generations to come.  Television's Star Trek was one such story, holding out the hope of racial equality and peaceful coexistence among diverse people.  In the light of recent concerns over global warming and its consequences, Surface could very easily have been the touchstone for us today, for it reveals, in breathtaking roller-coaster fashion, how seemingly minor environmental anomalies can balloon into unprecedented global change.The Story:  The series begins with what appears to be typical headline news:  a marine biologist stumbles upon something new in the ocean.  The series follows her journey of discovery and interweaves it with the stories of adults and children scattered across the globe (though primarily in the U.S.).  What they face fires the imagination.  At times terrifying, poignant (the acting is superb!), and nerve-racking, the storylines twist and turn from one revelation to another, interweaving and accelerating to the jaw-dropping finale.  To say more would be to spoil the journey, and an awesome one it is, too.The show lasted only fifteen episodes, and it very well may be that the show's creators attempted to compress the story so that the series could end well.  As a result, Surface feels very much like the fourth season of Babylon 5, beginning slowly, accelerating, and then hurtling headlong to an end that opens up a world of possibilities that demands further exploration.  Surface should be brought back--before some of the actors outgrow their parts!--to offer an example of how people rise to the occasion in the face of change.Aside from the compression, the show's only other flaw, if it is one, is that it borrows.  Some have mentioned Spielberg films, and this series is very much an homage to films like E.T. and Close Encounters.  However, it's FAR more than the sum of its parts, and it's definitely more relevant.  Whether you like the references or not, I believe you'll enjoy the series on its own merits.Finally, it's not the mystery or its unveiling that inspires here; it's the people:  their curiosity, their sense of wonder, their determination, their faith.

991629,A1O0TOFN85RIPH,B000FJH5M2,T. Lewandowski,"[2, 2]","I just completed watching the complete SURFACE series on DVD, six years after it aired on television.  (Never watched while is originally aired.)  From the very start I immediately noticed that Universal Studios did a wonderful job with the audio and video transfer quality on these discs.  It's one of the rare TV shows that the soundtrack actually made good use of the surround channel, and Universal's Dolby Digital 5.1 audio served well in keeping you in the middle of the video action.  Video quality was also quite good.  Not all standard resolution DVD's shine as well when up-scaled via HDMI, but SURFACE presents a solid standard resolution picture quality during practically every episode.Thankfully, Universal presents the series on four, single-sided, double-layer DVD's.  (Universal often opts to cheap-out with short-lived TV series releases by using double-sided, flipper discs...which can be difficult to handle and keep in good condition.)  The four discs are housed in standard Universal fare, in a layer design, which means you must remove a disc in order to access the disc below.As far as the show itself, I agree with others in that it was cancelled before its time.  By the end of the first season, the script was beginning to get very interesting and exciting.  I was really disappointed when I watched the season (series) finale the other day, knowing that there would be no more.  Everything was left pretty much unresolved.  The series had a few obvious and/or poorly written lines from time to time, but not enough to deter my wanting to watch and it never lost my interest.  Like JERICHO, SURFACE died way too young.  Perhaps if the SciFi Channel would have picked it up we would still be watching new episodes of SURFACE today...",4,"Gone before its time,,,",1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,1759,"['just', 'completed', 'watching', 'complete', 'SURFACE', 'series', 'DVD', 'six', 'years', 'aired', 'television', 'Never', 'watched', 'while', 'originally', 'aired', 'very', 'start', 'immediately', 'noticed', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'audio', 'video', 'transfer', 'quality', 'discs', 'one', 'rare', 'TV', 'shows', 'soundtrack', 'actually', 'made', 'good', 'use', 'surround', 'channel', 'Universal', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'audio', 'served', 'well', 'keeping', 'middle', 'video', 'action', 'Video', 'quality', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Not', 'standard', 'resolution', 'DVD', 'shine', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'up-scaled', 'HDMI', 'SURFACE', 'solid', 'standard', 'resolution', 'picture', 'quality', 'practically', 'episode.Thankfully', 'Universal', 'series', 'four', 'single-sided', 'double-layer', 'DVD', 'Universal', 'often', 'cheap-out', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'releases', 'using', 'double-sided', 'flipper', 'discs', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'handle', 'keep', 'good', 'condition', 'four', 'discs', 'are', 'housed', 'standard', 'Universal', 'fare', 'layer', 'design', 'must', 'remove', 'disc', 'order', 'access', 'disc', 'below.As', 'far', 'show', 'agree', 'others', 'was', 'cancelled', 'time', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'script', 'was', 'beginning', 'get', 'very', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'when', 'watched', 'season', 'series', 'finale', 'other', 'day', 'knowing', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'Everything', 'was', 'left', 'pretty', 'much', 'unresolved', 'series', 'had', 'few', 'obvious', 'and/or', 'poorly', 'written', 'lines', 'time', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'deter', 'wanting', 'watch', 'never', 'lost', 'interest', 'JERICHO', 'SURFACE', 'died', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'Perhaps', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'would', 'have', 'picked', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'watching', 'new', 'episodes', 'SURFACE', 'today']",N/A

What he doesn't expect is a certain change to happen when he almost dies.The oceanographer makes contact with the species and is the subject of complete persecusion by the government. She goes from fake plagiarism charges to real life Frankensteins to a whole new world.The insurance salesman loses his brother to the creature and spends the rest of the series acting like Richard Dreyfuss from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and every conspiracy theory comes out of the woodwork.A federal agent has alterior motives towards the species and he is not at all what he appears to be.You don't find out what happens next. The real masters behind the conspiracy are not brought down. The people, aside from the main characters, are pretty much dumb when it comes to anything.

991631,A96JD9312DHWC,B000FJH5M2,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[14, 18]","A young oceanographer, Laura Daughtery, makes an amazing discovery quite by and proclaims there is a NEW lifeform living at the bottom of the sea and that this lifefom is nothing if not enormous. Knowing that this is the find of the century, she veraciously peruses the creature while hoping to find out anything, and episode after episode finds her putting together a together what could loosely be described as a team that also want to understand. As the team becomes a little more embolden and does some things that had me questioning their sanity, they begin to find out more about the ""things"" while hoping to tell the world what is transpiring - and becoming famous in the process. The only problem with that is there are deeper depths than the places she wants to explore when it comes to the human psyche, and there are deviations far more sinister than those we are quick to label ""monsters"" when it comes to the ""what"" transpiring here.While all of this is occurring, a different kind of character finds himself mixed up in something that connects to this confrontation. Miles, troubled teenager that has no idea how much worse his life is capable of getting, makes a discovery that is equally shocking but keeps it to himself. While walking the beaches of his sleepy little town he finds an ""egg"" that has washed up on the shores that he does not recognize and, after a little while, the egg hatches a reptilian ""something"" with the ability to shock its prey into submission and to be cute - and vicious. Miles finds something there, an attachment of sorts, and quickly likens the thing Nimrod and decides to keep it in his home. This becomes more and more bizarre - and dangerous - as it progresses, and the puzzle happening all about the ocean quickly begins to show that Miles, for all his lack of ""direct involvement,"" has become a cog in this machine in more than a coincidental way.When Surface first began its run on television, I wasn't sure what to think of it. The pilot episode had me wanting more pieces of an eclectic puzzle involving gargantuan beasts and the little minnows hoping to survey them, shadowy people that said they were with the government but didn't seem to be working in ""the best interests"" of anyone, and all the build that started to follow had me praying to the television gods that everything would flesh out and keep on keeping on. In the middle of the season this was all threatened by the potential cancellation I somewhat thought might happen and even expected (showing this on primetime was perhaps not the best way to introduce it - especially when you think that people seem to want game shows, soap operas in varied disguises, and weird talent contests with the talent often missing), but by the last (the list spans Episodes #101 - #115) episode I was amazed by what the series had done and was sooo happy I had been there to see it piece-by-precious-piece. Apparently the show had been ready to only run one seasons as well; I'm sure they didn't think they could get the funding to keep going so they made something that ran the A-Z mile and, unlike so many other shows, finished what it started. As far as television shows go that is a rarity, and even rarer is a show that makes me break down and pick up a DVD compilation. Still, everyone I knew that had watched Surface loved it; my wife and I loved the show, my friends all loved the show, and even my mother said it was something she was happy to see on T.V. They all said it was because of a few things, too, but most it was because there had been an AMAZING ending that had a great build and was supported by a great cast.Additionally, there are EXTRAS that should be discussed. First, there are deleted scenes added back into the show from Episodes 102, 103, 105, 106, 109, and 114. 6/15 shows - that's a lot of episodes with something new to watch. There is also a behind the scenes look at the first season and how it came together, good for watching if you want to know ""a little extra"" about the show, complete with cast interviews. It is also in WIDESCREEN - I love the sound of that every time I get to ""say it.""I've seen monsters and I've seen series that revolved around monsters. The plot that developed here, however, and the thing it birthed; I never really saw that coming. If you missed it, you need to go back and reward yourself. This could be the best 15 episodes you'll ever find yourself treated to and, considering it was chopped on a little for television, you'll enjoy it more if you watch it on DVD.

It combined many of the classic storylines that are prevalent in Sci-Fi after the ""X-Files"" - massive conspiracy, possibility of alien infestation, government cover-ups, and two motivated individuals who join forces to uncover the secrets - to become a weekly show that was exciting and compelling.  I always felt that the show packed in a lot within 42 minutes and I always looked forwad to the next episode.  I hadn't felt like this since the ""X-files""!The two leads, Lake Bell and Jay R. Ferguson, played more realistic and grounded characters than is usual these days and both were very good in their roles.  The character of Miles, played by Carter Jenkins,was also very well scripted and his parallel story was deftly executed and complemented the main plot line until it merged in the final episode.  The series takes some time to get going but by the fifth episode you will be hooked, and by the tenth you will want to head for the finish!I was really disappointed when ""Surface"" was cancelled as I sincerely feel it was the best of last season's new shows.  The demise of ""Surface"" means that the story was not completed as the series cliffhanger leaves much unanswered and even more unresolved.  It requires either a mini-series or a extended feature to wrap things up for audiences.Buy the dvd and enjoy what should have been one of the best series this decade.
