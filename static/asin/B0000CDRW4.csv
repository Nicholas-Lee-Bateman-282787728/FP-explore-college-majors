It held my attention throughout its winded course.The suspense scenes are fabulously constructed, revolving around universally appealing themes -- bank heist, kidnapping, layered romance, betrayal, and above all, some fabulous twists.Part of the slick fun is trying to figure out what the characters have up their individual sleeves, what surprising turn each may have to dish out. Result, an alluring semi-noir in which the audience is not privy in advance to how they'll all get away with it, or even who the good or the bad guys are.Towards the end, we fall into the net of one gratuitous turn too many, which the eventually simplistic plot clearly did not have an appetite to digest, but hey, overall it is pretty cleverly done.

775734,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000CDRW4,Tsuyoshi,"[12, 14]","""No Good Deed"" is based on Dashiell Hammett's short (and very short) story titled ""The House on Turk Street"" which is included his book ""The Continental Op.""  The original short story appaered in 1924, but as is often the case with film adaptations, the story is extended to cover its running time, perhaps stretched beyond its limit.In this noir film, not an ""op(erative),"" but a cop Jack Friar plays the usual role of reluctant hero.  Jack is asked to search the whereabout of a missing girl when he, being an  amateur cellist, is about to join in the classic music festival.  Against his better judgment, he promises to seek for her, and goes to ""the house on Turk Street.""  Too late that he realizes he stepped into the wrong place where he, or any other cops, should not be.There he encounters a motley group of criminals, who plan to get easy money from a bank.  Captured by them, Jack has only his brain to rely on, to get away from this big trouble.Be warned.  This is a noir film, which means you cannot look for any conherent logics (can anyone summerize the plot of ""Maltise Falcon""?)  There are so many incredible decisions the characters make, or so many unbelievable coincidences.  If you don't like these kinds of situations too good to be true, just forget about the film.But the film looks beautiful as noir, and director is Bob Rafelson, who recently gave us atomospheric ""Blood and Wine.""  ""No Good Deed"" has also equally credible sinister atmosphere, thanks to production designer Paul Peters and photographer Juan Luiz-Anchia.  If you love this genre, you might find the film  more engaging than other movie fans do.As to actors.  Sam Jackson is as good as ever (have we seen bad Sam Jackson?) but his actions sometimes lack convincing touch, not because of his acting, but because of the plot (Amazon's editorial review is perfectly right).  As a femme fatale Erin who must survive, using whatever method she can grab, you can see Milla Jovovich, whom I thought, though she is doing her best, still slightly is miscast.  But some people might find otherwise, so leave it to other reviewers.More interesting and funny is the couple of Mr./Mrs. Quarre, played by Joss Ackland and Grace Zabriskie.  They are simply amusing to see, with the wicked humor only those veterans can show.  Oh, and I almost forgot to say that Stellan Skarsgard is the leader of the criminal group, whose character is always full of menace hidden under his calm attitude.  He makes a great contrast with Doug Hutchison's most dangerous computer wiz that appeared on the screen.""No Good Deed"" is not good indeed, but its characters are drawn farily well, and the film manages to show some nice atomosphere of noir films.  I don't think not many people have seen it, and that is understandable, but those who like the genre will find it pretty interesting.By the way, in the film, you hear an old song ""I'm not Your Stepping Stone"" originally played by the Monkees.  Of course, Bob Rafelson was producer of this popular TV series (1966-68), and the version you hear here is performed by Peter Rafelson, his son who is also known for Madonna song.",3,So-so Noir Film Featuring Sam Jackson and Milla Jovovich,1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,3139,"['No', 'Good', 'Deed', 'based', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'short', 'very', 'short', 'story', 'titled', 'House', 'Turk', 'Street', 'included', 'book', 'Continental', 'Op', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'appaered', '1924', 'often', 'case', 'film', 'adaptations', 'story', 'extended', 'cover', 'running', 'time', 'perhaps', 'stretched', 'limit.In', 'noir', 'film', 'not', 'op', 'erative', 'cop', 'Jack', 'Friar', 'usual', 'role', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'Jack', 'asked', 'search', 'whereabout', 'missing', 'girl', 'when', 'being', 'amateur', 'cellist', 'join', 'classic', 'music', 'festival', 'better', 'judgment', 'seek', 'house', 'Turk', 'Street', 'Too', 'late', 'stepped', 'wrong', 'place', 'where', 'other', 'cops', 'should', 'not', 'be.There', 'motley', 'group', 'criminals', 'who', 'plan', 'get', 'easy', 'money', 'bank', 'Captured', 'Jack', 'only', 'brain', 'rely', 'get', 'away', 'big', 'trouble.Be', 'warned', 'noir', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'look', 'conherent', 'logics', 'can', 'anyone', 'summerize', 'plot', 'Maltise', 'Falcon', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'incredible', 'decisions', 'characters', 'make', 'so', 'many', 'unbelievable', 'coincidences', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'kinds', 'situations', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'just', 'forget', 'film.But', 'film', 'beautiful', 'noir', 'director', 'Bob', 'Rafelson', 'who', 'recently', 'gave', 'atomospheric', 'Blood', 'Wine', 'No', 'Good', 'Deed', 'also', 'equally', 'credible', 'sinister', 'atmosphere', 'thanks', 'production', 'designer', 'Paul', 'Peters', 'photographer', 'Juan', 'Luiz-Anchia', 'love', 'genre', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'more', 'engaging', 'other', 'movie', 'fans', 'do.As', 'actors', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'have', 'seen', 'bad', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'actions', 'sometimes', 'lack', 'convincing', 'touch', 'not', 'acting', 'plot', 'Amazon', 'editorial', 'review', 'perfectly', 'right', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Erin', 'who', 'must', 'survive', 'using', 'can', 'grab', 'can', 'see', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'whom', 'thought', 'doing', 'best', 'still', 'slightly', 'miscast', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'otherwise', 'so', 'leave', 'other', 'reviewers.More', 'interesting', 'funny', 'couple', 'Mr./Mrs', 'Quarre', 'played', 'Joss', 'Ackland', 'Grace', 'Zabriskie', 'are', 'simply', 'amusing', 'see', 'wicked', 'humor', 'only', 'veterans', 'can', 'show', 'Oh', 'almost', 'forgot', 'say', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'leader', 'criminal', 'group', 'character', 'always', 'full', 'menace', 'hidden', 'calm', 'attitude', 'great', 'contrast', 'Doug', 'Hutchison', 'most', 'dangerous', 'computer', 'wiz', 'appeared', 'screen', 'No', 'Good', 'Deed', 'not', 'good', 'indeed', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'farily', 'well', 'film', 'show', 'nice', 'atomosphere', 'noir', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'understandable', 'who', 'like', 'genre', 'will', 'find', 'pretty', 'way', 'film', 'hear', 'old', 'song', ""'m"", 'not', 'Stepping', 'Stone', 'originally', 'played', 'Monkees', 'course', 'Bob', 'Rafelson', 'was', 'producer', 'popular', 'TV', 'series', '1966-68', 'version', 'hear', 'here', 'performed', 'Peter', 'Rafelson', 'son', 'who', 'also', 'known', 'Madonna', 'song']",No Good Deed
