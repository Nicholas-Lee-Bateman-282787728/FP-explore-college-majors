1147490,A14Y2BFP2PTJP2,B0014VPFT0,"Endora Aphrattos ""Endora Aphrattos""","[1, 1]","I have never been a Clint Eastwood Fan.  A few of his Westerns early on and a few of his films later from his career is about it.  ""Every Which Way But Loose"" and it's sequel ""Any Which Way You Can"" are two of the latter.  These films, amazingly enough, Eastwood believed would break him free of his tough guy image.  I've no idea how he thought that since the whole thing is built on a foundation of fighting, but, that just me I guess.  This is the story of a man and his monkey (orangutan, to be PC) and their adventures.  Sandra Locke is his love interest of sorts and they are a match made in Hades I assure you, but, I'll leave that at that for your own scrutiny.  Whether brothers or friends, I am never quite sure, it is about a man who's sole source of income relies on how much is bet in arranged, illegal fights.  His brother/friend is his pseudo-manager of sorts who arranges the ""events"" then they run around getting drunk and fighting even more.  Until Clint meets Sandra Locke's character (a bar singer) and falls head over heels in love, amazingly enough.  Needless to say I never cared for Locke.  Be that as it may,  it is about relationships and love and pulling through together.  The wonderful Ruth Gordon plays his mother and the mishaps with her are purely hilarious and worth every penny invested in this purchase by themselves.  When Locke's character disappears, seemingly unwillingly, Eastwood and brother/friend hit the road and the ""rescue"" ensues leaving ""Ma"" (Gordon) to fend off a motorcycle gang Eastwood has made enemies of, deal with the police looking for him... No worries, where do you think Eastwood got his groove.  The sequel is more of the same stuff.  I was a little upset that Beverly D'Angelo's Echo had not returned and for the most part it was a no discussion event.  A little explanation would have been nice, but, if it is in there I missed it.  Honkeytonk Man is a super movie about a poor farm boy (played by Eastwood's son) who must attend his sick uncle getting him to Nashville for his big break into the music industry.  The problem is he has tuberculosis and is on his last leg.All in all I enjoyed all of these films.  I liked them more than the one before it, when watch in order, to be honest.",4,"Every,  Any, Honkytonkin' Man",1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,2252,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Fan', 'A', 'few', 'Westerns', 'early', 'few', 'films', 'later', 'career', 'Which', 'Way', 'Loose', 'sequel', 'Any', 'Which', 'Way', 'Can', 'are', 'two', 'latter', 'films', 'amazingly', 'enough', 'Eastwood', 'believed', 'would', 'break', 'free', 'tough', 'guy', 'image', ""'ve"", 'idea', 'how', 'thought', 'whole', 'thing', 'built', 'foundation', 'fighting', 'just', 'guess', 'story', 'man', 'monkey', 'orangutan', 'be', 'PC', 'adventures', 'Sandra', 'Locke', 'love', 'interest', 'sorts', 'are', 'match', 'made', 'Hades', 'assure', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'own', 'scrutiny', 'Whether', 'brothers', 'friends', 'am', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'man', 'who', 'sole', 'source', 'income', 'relies', 'how', 'much', 'bet', 'arranged', 'illegal', 'fights', 'brother/friend', 'pseudo-manager', 'sorts', 'who', 'events', 'then', 'run', 'getting', 'drunk', 'fighting', 'even', 'more', 'Clint', 'meets', 'Sandra', 'Locke', 'character', 'bar', 'singer', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'amazingly', 'enough', 'Needless', 'say', 'never', 'cared', 'Locke', 'Be', 'may', 'relationships', 'love', 'pulling', 'together', 'wonderful', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'mother', 'mishaps', 'are', 'purely', 'hilarious', 'worth', 'penny', 'invested', 'purchase', 'When', 'Locke', 'character', 'seemingly', 'unwillingly', 'Eastwood', 'brother/friend', 'hit', 'road', 'rescue', 'ensues', 'leaving', 'Ma', 'Gordon', 'fend', 'off', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'Eastwood', 'made', 'enemies', 'deal', 'police', 'looking', 'worries', 'where', 'do', 'think', 'Eastwood', 'got', 'groove', 'sequel', 'more', 'same', 'stuff', 'was', 'little', 'upset', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'Echo', 'had', 'not', 'returned', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'discussion', 'event', 'little', 'explanation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'missed', 'Honkeytonk', 'Man', 'super', 'movie', 'poor', 'farm', 'boy', 'played', 'Eastwood', 'son', 'who', 'must', 'attend', 'sick', 'uncle', 'getting', 'Nashville', 'big', 'break', 'music', 'industry', 'problem', 'tuberculosis', 'last', 'leg.All', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'liked', 'more', 'one', 'when', 'watch', 'order', 'be', 'honest']",N/A
