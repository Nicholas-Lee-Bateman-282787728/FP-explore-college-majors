I'm making steady improvement following the video, the instruction is great, the only real problem is that sometimes the person the video does not synchronize with the voice instructions.

The poses are arranged in groups for different aims (i.e. ""revitalizing,"" ""quieting,"" etc.)  You can mix and match, or go from one pose to the next in a set.  But it isn't a routine or a practice, with a rationale and flow from one pose to the next.  You are basically constantly interrupted by the DVD to change your pose, employ a prop, etc.  I would really appreciate an actual practice composed of poses for inflexible people, so I can really do a daily routine and build on it.",3,Collection of poses,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,582,"['fine', 'compendium', 'yoga', 'poses', 'modified', 'props', 'inflexible', 'people', 'poses', 'are', 'arranged', 'groups', 'different', 'aims', 'i.e', 'revitalizing', 'quieting', 'etc', 'can', 'mix', 'match', 'go', 'one', 'pose', 'next', 'set', ""n't"", 'routine', 'practice', 'rationale', 'flow', 'one', 'pose', 'next', 'are', 'basically', 'constantly', 'interrupted', 'DVD', 'change', 'pose', 'employ', 'prop', 'etc', 'would', 'really', 'appreciate', 'actual', 'practice', 'composed', 'poses', 'inflexible', 'people', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'daily', 'routine', 'build']",Yoga For Inflexible People
719242,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,B00006JXWB,C. Daly,"[39, 59]","The appeal of this DVD is the large number of workouts it has.  You can pick a basic workout, a workout focused on a specific body part, an energizing or relaxing workouts, or even a menstruation workout.  There are also several lengths for each type of workout, ranging from 15 to 90 minutes.The workouts have poor production quality, though, and don't really flow.  Each pose consists of a short chapter of 3-10 minutes, which are reused in many of the workouts.  So you'll do a pose, then there's a pause while your DVD player finds the right chapter to go to next.  Then there's a black screen with the name of the pose and a listing of props you might need.  Then the pose is explained and demonstrated. You may need to pause the DVD at this point to get for the props and put them in the right place.  Props needed include: pillow, yoga blocks (2), towel or yoga strap, chair, and a wall to lean up against.In addition to the lack of flow, the production leaves something to be desired.  The background is a bland blue-grey wall.  There is a person demonstrating the poses, and a voice over explaining the poses.  The explanations do not always match what the demonstrator is doing.  So that is annoying.  The demonstrator is a woman who wears a lifeless, somewhat depressing expression (or should I say lack of expression) throughout all of the workouts.  If these things don't bother you, than this DVD is a great value.

I got down on the fit path, and I do a very good workout routine now, but I still hated stretching because I was so inflexible, and the back still went out.I moved from stretching into this yoga video.  It might not be like a complete smooth routine, but you can plan your own routine from the dvd menu screen.  And you are slowly learning to move your body into a more flexible structure.  I suppose the philosophy of yoga is not explained very well if at all, however, right now my concern is to get my body back to mostly limber.  Once I feel that these positions have helped me do that I will hopefully move on to full routines.If you have wanted to try yoga but are either overweight or inflexible, this program is a very gentle, sensible introduction to allow you to try and not feel foolish.This program can be tailored to fit your needs every day, you can choose a strength program, a flexibility program or relaxation or energizing.  You can also move between the body parts you would like to exercise, your back, your hips, your arms, your legs, you get the picture.  That is how you can build up to 35 different programs.This was really what I was looking for.

SHE is not the instructor, or if she is, it's not obvious.  therefore, she is simply executing the moves described in the voice-over.  i found her perfectly human, and if she's not dynamic or animated enough for some people, that doesn't make her a zombie.  i bought this video with some trepidation having read these reviews and want to say i found them a bit ridiculously overstated.  everyone is entitled to their opinion, and that's fine, but if you are put off by reading this, just please know if you want a demonstration, that's what you are going to get, if you want charismatic leadership, you might want a different video.  but i wouldn't assume that you will find this model is somehow inhuman because she isn't emoting all over the place.with all that said.  i was looking for a dvd with some brief workouts.  i think is a good instructional video for yoga, particularly for beginners.  i did find sometimes the voiceover and the modelling did not match up, the voiceover seemed to give some instructions which were just not modelled, but i did not find this interfered too much overall. the voiceover was more helpful in doing the little things that were almost imperceptable, like ""widening the inner thigh"" type moves.  understanding the special vocabulary was sometimes confusing.  for instance, with a real novice, do they really know what it means to ""lengthen the spine"" or ""flare the collarbone"" - am i really doing what she is telling me to do?  maybe i need to go back to the dvd and see if there is an introductory workout, but, if there is, i probably already passed on it because it was too long for me to get into.i also found that sometimes the instructions were confusing to me as a novice.  i did not find enough brief workouts to be useful to me.  also, you will need props, which was disappointing.  they used, in the two that i viewed, a chair and blankets.  i really need something that is bare bones.  at least they aren't using the props to promote their own products, they are things you can find around the home.i think if you want to really learn yoga, this is probably a good instructional dvd to have in your collection - whether it is the best, especially for a sole purchase, depends on what else it out there.  if you want to do yoga simply to stretch and gain some of the health benefits more than as a practice, and particularly if you are looking for a library of brief practices, you may not be so happy with this one.  i will probably end up buying another dvd, but i'm did give this four stars, and i expect to continue to use it, just not for the original reason i bought it.",4,"good, not great for my purposes",1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,3017,"['first', 'i', 'think', 'woman', 'demonstrating', 'moves', 'was', 'fine', 'YOGA', 'not', 'freakin', 'aerobics', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'i', 'one', 'am', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'have', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'plastic', 'smile', 'pasted', 'face', 'showing', 'moves', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'looking', 'inspiration', 'i', ""'m"", 'looking', 'instruction', 'one', 'thing', 'woman', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'speaking', 'least', 'bits', 'i', 'viewed', 'SHE', 'not', 'instructor', 'not', 'obvious', 'therefore', 'simply', 'executing', 'moves', 'described', 'voice-over', 'i', 'found', 'perfectly', 'human', 'not', 'dynamic', 'animated', 'enough', 'people', ""n't"", 'make', 'zombie', 'i', 'bought', 'video', 'trepidation', 'having', 'read', 'reviews', 'want', 'say', 'i', 'found', 'bit', 'ridiculously', 'overstated', 'everyone', 'entitled', 'opinion', 'fine', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'reading', 'just', 'please', 'know', 'want', 'demonstration', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'want', 'charismatic', 'leadership', 'might', 'want', 'different', 'video', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'assume', 'will', 'find', 'model', 'somehow', 'inhuman', ""n't"", 'emoting', 'place.with', 'said', 'i', 'was', 'looking', 'dvd', 'brief', 'workouts', 'i', 'think', 'good', 'instructional', 'video', 'yoga', 'particularly', 'beginners', 'i', 'did', 'find', 'sometimes', 'voiceover', 'modelling', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'up', 'voiceover', 'seemed', 'give', 'instructions', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'modelled', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'interfered', 'too', 'much', 'overall', 'voiceover', 'was', 'more', 'helpful', 'doing', 'little', 'things', 'were', 'almost', 'imperceptable', 'widening', 'inner', 'thigh', 'type', 'moves', 'understanding', 'special', 'vocabulary', 'was', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'instance', 'real', 'novice', 'do', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'lengthen', 'spine', 'flare', 'collarbone', 'am', 'i', 'really', 'doing', 'what', 'telling', 'do', 'maybe', 'i', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'dvd', 'see', 'introductory', 'workout', 'i', 'probably', 'already', 'passed', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'into.i', 'also', 'found', 'instructions', 'were', 'confusing', 'novice', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'enough', 'brief', 'workouts', 'be', 'useful', 'also', 'will', 'need', 'props', 'was', 'disappointing', 'used', 'two', 'i', 'viewed', 'chair', 'blankets', 'i', 'really', 'need', 'something', 'bare', 'bones', 'least', 'are', ""n't"", 'using', 'props', 'promote', 'own', 'products', 'are', 'things', 'can', 'find', 'home.i', 'think', 'want', 'really', 'learn', 'yoga', 'probably', 'good', 'instructional', 'dvd', 'have', 'collection', 'best', 'especially', 'sole', 'purchase', 'what', 'else', 'out', 'there', 'want', 'do', 'yoga', 'simply', 'stretch', 'gain', 'health', 'benefits', 'more', 'practice', 'particularly', 'are', 'looking', 'library', 'brief', 'practices', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'happy', 'one', 'i', 'will', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'buying', 'dvd', 'i', ""'m"", 'did', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'i', 'expect', 'continue', 'use', 'just', 'not', 'original', 'reason', 'i', 'bought']",Yoga For Inflexible People
