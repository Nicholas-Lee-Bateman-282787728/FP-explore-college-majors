251896,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,6301412761,absent_minded_prof,"[0, 0]","I only just saw this movie, for the first time, a few weeks ago. Somehow I missed it when it first came out, although I was 22 at the time and I wish I had seen it... Although I only saw it recently, and must allow my opinions to settle down a little, I strongly suspect that this movie will end up right up there with ""Somewhere in Time"" on my personal list of all time favorite romantic movies.John Cusack, it goes without saying, is unbelievable as always. I'm not going to dwell on his many virtues here -- chances are, anyone seeing this review is scoping out this movie because they are already a John Cusack fan, or perhaps a Cameron Crowe fan... The female lead, Ione Skye, is just amazing. She's even more beautiful then her name, which is really saying something. Also, I'm a real sucker for terrific voices -- she has a really nice, slightly whispery, mellifluous, relaxing voice that you won't be able to forget. She's also been in ""Mindwalk"" and ""The River's Edge,"" if anyone wants to see her in other flicks...Anyway, I'm not enough of an expert on movies to be able to say which scenes owe more to the actors, or which owe more to the director, but it just seems to me that they all worked extremely well together. There are five or six scenes here, primarily in the first half of the movie, that you will want to see again and again. They have exactly the right touch, somehow, they never try too hard to be funny, or to be romantic, or to outline the personalities of the characters. This probably means that they actually tried REALLY hard to do all those things, but they just conceal the effort very well. Also, they just add a personal touch in a really memorable way -- you seriously do feel like you are watching real people in a real relationship. It doesn't seem like a movie. Everyone is fully realized.I was a little disappointed at the ending, somehow. Maybe it's because I like John Mahoney (who plays Frazier's dad, Martin, on ""Frazier"") but the whole thing of him getting nabbed for financial misdoings just didn't sit well with me. It was the only part of the movie that seemed even slightly contrived. Still, the first part of the movie is so fantastic that it more than makes up for any troubles toward the end. An amazing romance story, and one of the few that really feel grounded in human realities.

251897,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,6301412761,A Customer,"[9, 9]","&quot;Say Anything&quot; pinpoints a different kind of 80s love story movie, with less ridiculous attempts at comedy and more of a meaningfull plot. John Cusack spent most of the 80s spinning out classic teenaged comedy, but cuts down on the often needless immature and spastic humor in this movie. His trademark I think is his nervous and eager personality as the classic underachiever. Playing C student Lloyd Dobbler about to graduate from high school, he falls helplessly in love with the shy and lacking of self-esteem validictorian Diane Cort, played by Ione Skye. Lloyd lives with his sister Constance, a single mother and an un-credited part played by John's sister Joan Cusack, and focuses his life around kick-boxing. Lloyd and Diane wind up falling in love despite their differences, but are torn apart by the legal troubles of Diane's father, played excellently by John Mahoney. The movie centers around Cusack's determination to hold on to his relationship with Skye, doing everything it takes for them to stay together. The performances and original storyline are what make &quot;Say Anything&quot; great, and the movie is full of scenes that will never die. Scenes like Cusack holding a radio above his head outside Skye's bedroom window one night playing &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; by Peter Gabriel. No one by John Cusack could've done something better and more effective in a film. &quot;Say Anything&quot; in my mind is a new classic, a movie worth having when the box office keeps pucking up the same romantic attempt at garbage every year, I give the movie 5 stars.",5,Good Movies Must Be a Cusack Tradition,984960000,"03 19, 2001",2001,1583,"['quot', 'Say', 'Anything', 'quot', 'different', 'kind', '80s', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'less', 'ridiculous', 'attempts', 'comedy', 'more', 'meaningfull', 'plot', 'John', 'Cusack', 'spent', 'most', '80s', 'spinning', 'out', 'classic', 'teenaged', 'comedy', 'down', 'often', 'needless', 'immature', 'spastic', 'humor', 'movie', 'trademark', 'think', 'nervous', 'eager', 'personality', 'classic', 'underachiever', 'Playing', 'C', 'student', 'Lloyd', 'Dobbler', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'helplessly', 'love', 'shy', 'lacking', 'self-esteem', 'validictorian', 'Diane', 'Cort', 'played', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'Lloyd', 'sister', 'Constance', 'single', 'mother', 'un-credited', 'part', 'played', 'John', 'sister', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'life', 'kick-boxing', 'Lloyd', 'Diane', 'wind', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'differences', 'are', 'torn', 'apart', 'legal', 'troubles', 'Diane', 'father', 'played', 'excellently', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'movie', 'centers', 'Cusack', 'determination', 'hold', 'relationship', 'Skye', 'doing', 'everything', 'stay', 'together', 'performances', 'original', 'storyline', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'quot', 'Say', 'Anything', 'quot', 'great', 'movie', 'full', 'scenes', 'will', 'never', 'die', 'Scenes', 'Cusack', 'holding', 'radio', 'head', 'Skye', 'bedroom', 'window', 'one', 'night', 'playing', 'quot', 'Your', 'Eyes', 'quot', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'one', 'John', 'Cusack', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'something', 'better', 'more', 'effective', 'film', 'quot', 'Say', 'Anything', 'quot', 'mind', 'new', 'classic', 'movie', 'worth', 'having', 'when', 'box', 'office', 'keeps', 'pucking', 'up', 'same', 'romantic', 'attempt', 'garbage', 'year', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars']",Say Anything VHS

I'm being generous in my review. My wife did not really care for it at all. We both got some good laughs, but come on people, this is a pretty cheesy movie. It's better than many of the 'romantic comedies' of the era, but most of those were miserable. Even the use of Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" is a bit odd since the song came out three years before the film. I love John Cusack in other films and I liked him here. I liked Ione Skye as well. And at times the dialog just sparkled with inspiration. But other times I laughed out loud at the unintended humor of the dialog and acting (were ""beatboxing"" white guys cool or funny even in 1989!?). The film has its moments of greatness, but just wasn't terribly powerful for me. Afterwards I had that ""eh..."" sort of feeling that I get when I've spent a couple hours on a film and don't really get a payoff. The film shows promise, but ultimately falls into so many of the cliche traps of others similar to it. The story was so-so, I did enjoy the father's character immensely-what a great actor. I expected a few more laughs. I just feel very so-so about this film.  The disc contains a good amount of extras, but I didn't even care enough to watch them.

Now, I know that stereotypical macho guys wouldn't want to watch any romantic movie at all (I don't count as a ""macho guy"" because I love James Taylor, I hate sports and my favorite movie is ""Forrest Gump""; take what you want from that).The best and most poignant thing about this movie is that it rings true. Cameroon Crowe has fashioned for us a beautiful story about a young couple that rings true. The script is full of memorable lines ranging from the funny (""I whish you had taken the keys out of your hand first, brother!"") to the poignant (""Are you here because you need someone, or because you need me?...Forget it, I don't care"") to the truly unforgettable. (""I gave her my heart, she gave me a pen.""However, at the center of the film is the amazing, unflappable, John Cusack. His Lloyd Dobbler is one of the most identifiable characters in contemporary cinema. He's at his best in his many stuttering, tragic monologues, his flow of consciousness tape recordings detailing his heartache, and especially in his ""eighth and final call"" to Diane: ""Maybe I don't know you, maybe you were a mirage, maybe the world exploded in a supernova of food and sex and in that case it's not your fault"". What does that mean? Nothing. And yet everything.Finally: the supporting characters. There's nothing wrong with Ione Skye and John Mahoney; but they get all the press. We're talking Lili Taylor. ""Joe lies, Joe lies when he cries"": the passion Corey exudes over Joe, and the anguish she goes through, knowing he's so much beneath him, yet she reluctantly loves him anyway. We're talking Joan Cusack. Constance definitely needed more screen time; she was a fun character to watch, as all of Joan's characters are. In fact, all of the people who had any line at all, up to and including the guy who passes through and say's ""Lloyd Dobler, all right!"" to Diane at the party, are all perfect, just a testament to Crowe's directing abilities.If none of that does it for you ask yourself this: what could possibly be cuter then a five-year-old punching a punching bag while being held by his 18-year-old uncle, being asked ""What do we want?"", and after a perfect pause yelling ""Pain!""?

However, as one who absolutely hates anything that remotely resembles a ""chick flick,"" I was pleasantly suprised to see that Cameron Crowe was able to successfully navigate the Scylla and Charybdis of romantic teen movie cliches: on one hand it wasn't overly dramatic and on the other it didn't pander to the dumb ""gross-out"" humor so common in today's cinema.In my opinion, the most underrated aspect of this film is John Mahoney.  While Cusak and Skye were excellent and their on-screen chemistry can't be beat, Mahoney's portrayal of a father who'll do anything (including breaking the law) to aide his daughters success is pitch-perfect.Crowe's directorial debut also plays well on his strengths.  The dialogue is crisp and witty.  The music is well chosen and makes it seem as though each musician wrote the song specifically for that scene even though some of the songs (like ""Back in the Saddle Again"") had been out for over a decade.

Diane is the valedictorian of her high school class, and after graduation, Lloyd asks her to escort him to a party.  Diane leaves the part disappointed that she never really got to know any of the kids in her class, but happy to have met Lloyd.  They begin dating, much to the chagrin of Diane's father (John Mahoney).  However, her father loses leverage when the IRS comes knocking on his door and charges him with tax evasion.  This ordeal is very trying on Diane and her father, and though she continues to side with him, their relationship suffers as a result.  Her father convinces her that the best thing for her to do is to break up with Lloyd and go on to college with ""no strings attached"".  She reluctantly follows his advice, and Lloyd is heartbroken.  However, when Diane discovers that her father has been lying to her all along about his innocence in his financial ordeal, she realizes just how much she really needs Lloyd's support.  I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it's incredibly cute.John Cusack does a great job in this movie.  He's great at playing the ""heartbroken boyfriend"" types of character, as he did in subsequent movies like ""High Fidelity"".  He's gone on to become a solid actor, but this movie will show you exactly where he got his start.  Ione Skye is also adorable in her role as the class nerd turned object-of-desire.  The reason why this movie is so loved is not as much for the plot as the chemistry between these two people.  The audience is made to believe that these two people really complement each other and belong together.  This is also Cameron Crowe's first attempt at directing.  He's gone on to direct several great movies like ""Jerry Maguire"", and he even won an Academy Award for the screenplay to ""Almost Famous"", but I believe this movie to be just as good as any of his other works.This movie is definitely one you'll want to watch over and over again.

Frankly, I like it BETTER than I liked its  writer-director's later film, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, which is saying a  lot.  A very young John Cusack is the hero here.  I'd only seen him in one  other movie when I saw this one.  I was incredibly impressed with his  performance, of a young man without any firm goals of his own other than  being extraordinarily committed to a young woman who has thought in terms  of nothing but goals her entire life.  She is played very well by Ione  Skye.  Unfortunately, I've only seen her in a few other roles over the  years.  Mahoney, the actor playing her father, does a shocking, but  completely believable turn, as the ideal dad who turns bad.  One line in  this film stands out in my mind more than any other line.  It is the father  telling his daughter, &quot;I did it for you,&quot; to excuse himself from  his own fraudulent, criminal conduct.  This is so true-to-life in so many  family or friend situations, that I'm sure everyone will hear it with the  shock of recognition.  Cusack and Skye make it seem extremely likely that  they will stay together through the long years after high school  graduation, which is when we see them in this movie.

251913,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6301412761,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","Cameron Crowe directed this little movie, and he has created a feminist statement. It is from the romantic comedy, subdivision teen, genre, but it is a story told from a female perspective. It is like a female fantasy, new age sensitive guy--but the problem is, in real life the girl would never go for the guy, even though in the fantasy movie they do, in real life, not so much. But if you can suspend your disbelief long enough, it is an entertaining little tale.Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) met Diane Court (Ione Skye) in a mall food court, but she is way out of his league. She has a fellowship and she is headed for the Ivy League. Lloyd Dobler has only feeble dreams of kick boxing glory, but though he is hopelessly outclassed, he goes for her anyway.Her father, Jim Court (John Mahoney), presents Lloyd's main obstacle. Hey, it's Martin Crane, from the Frasier TV Show. His character here is much meaner than Marty Crane:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jim Court: You're not a permanent part of her life. You're a distraction.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------He is so protective of his daughter; you'd think he was jealous. He just wants the best for her, though. But what he does to get it, you don't want to know. That is the skeleton in his closet.Lloyd is a post-modern, sensitive male. He even has female friends--chief among them Corey Flood. She and D.C. (Amy Brooks) offer moral support and advice:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Corey Flood: Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you. She's a brain.D.C.: Trapped in the body of a game-show hostess.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------But Corey has a few issues of her own. She has more baggage than a three-wheeled cart stuck on a Jet Blue tarmac. She has written 65 songs about Joe, her ex-boyfriend, and she carries a guitar to parties where she makes her friends listen to them all. In spite of their advice about the hopelessness of pursuing Diane Court Lloyd soldiers on. He is persistent, I'll give him that. And it pays off:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Corey Flood: Did you sleep with her?Lloyd Dobler: I admit nothing.D.C.: Lloyd, it's us.Corey Flood: Look at his face. He did the deed.D.C.: You're an inspiration, Lloyd. You should go on the 700 Club or something.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------They are not the only ones who are baffled by the headway Lloyd is making with Diane Court:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mike Cameron: I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you - how'd you get Diane Court to go out with you?Lloyd Dobler: I called her up.Mike Cameron: But how come it worked? I mean, like, what are you?Lloyd Dobler: I'm Lloyd Dobler.Mike Cameron: This is great. This gives me hope. Thanks.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This story is boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, so you know the boy just simply must get-girl-back. But not without a lot of pain and anguish on the boy's part:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------D.C.: Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?Lloyd Dobler: 'Cause I'm a guy. I have pride.Corey Flood: You're not a guy.Lloyd Dobler: I am.Corey Flood: No. The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lloyd finally has his epiphany, and sets out after Diane with renewed purpose:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lloyd Dobler: The rain on my car is a baptism, the new me, Ice Man, Power Lloyd, my assault on the world begins now.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In summary, this was a very solid effort by director Cameron Crowe. The young John Cusack totally carries the film, an unlikely but irrepressible leading man, a veritable force of nature. Ione Skye, the daughter of Scottish singer Donovan, has the rock star daughter looks of a Liv Tyler, but with brains, or she can at least pass for a valedictorian. She hits all the right notes, and looks smart doing it. Lili Taylor really stood out in her small part of female pal. And great laughs at the contrast when he hangs out with the guys. They give stupid advice, much worse than he gets from his female friends. My favorite character here is Mark (Jeremy Piven).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lloyd Dobler: I got a question. If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' Sip on a Saturday night completely alone drinking beers with no women anywhere?Joe: By choice, man.Mark: Yeah. By choice.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lloyd might not know what he wants to do, other than hang out with Jim Court's daughter, but he knows what he doesn't want:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lloyd Dobler: I don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought, or processed, or repair anything sold, bought, or processed. You know, as a career, I don't want to do that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cameron Crowe ...

But it isn't, the two find that their wavelengths aren't that different at all, and romance blooms.  Too bad the girl's father (the excellent John Mahoney) thinks that it would be better if his girl dumped this 'distraction' before it ruins her life.By remaining true to his characters, writer/director Cameron Crowe builds a story that is both conventional and unconventional, honest yet optomistic.

Cameron Crowe's intelligent scrip, and 2.  the terrific casting of Cusack (both brother and sister), Skye, Mahoney, and Taylor.Mr. Cusack's Dobler is hands down one of his most memorable characters.  He WILL forever be remembered as Dobler.  I bet most guys can relate to his character's inner and outer workings of pursuing the love interest.  Miss Skye was perfect for being a beauty but not too perfect physically to seem too unreal.  If there ever was an intriguing father-daughter encounter, you'd find it in this movie when Miss Skye told her dad (Mr. Mahoney) about her first sexual encounter.Just one question to Mr. Crowe: how would you envision the transformation of Lloyd and Diane's relationship, as they grow older in age and more developed in personality?  How the genuine love between these two withstands the test of time and changing environment/mindset?  It'd take a certain maturity from Diane to support and respect a 'slacker' like Lloyd who doesn't 'fit in' her path.  It'd take a great deal of courage for Lloyd to pursue what he believes (in kickboxing) and in the same time accepts Diane's intelligence and possible career success without loosing his own self-esteem.Makes you think, huh.......................",5,Those were the days....,1018915200,"04 16, 2002",2002,1381,"['Watching', 'movie', 'days', 'innocence', 'Two', 'high', 'school', 'grads', 'embarking', 'different', 'paths', 'fell', 'other', 'worked', '1', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'intelligent', 'scrip', '2.', 'terrific', 'casting', 'Cusack', 'brother', 'sister', 'Skye', 'Mahoney', 'Taylor.Mr', 'Cusack', 'Dobler', 'hands', 'down', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'WILL', 'forever', 'be', 'remembered', 'Dobler', 'bet', 'most', 'guys', 'can', 'relate', 'character', 'inner', 'outer', 'workings', 'pursuing', 'love', 'interest', 'Miss', 'Skye', 'was', 'perfect', 'being', 'beauty', 'not', 'too', 'perfect', 'physically', 'seem', 'too', 'unreal', 'ever', 'was', 'intriguing', 'father-daughter', 'encounter', ""'d"", 'find', 'movie', 'when', 'Miss', 'Skye', 'told', 'dad', 'Mr.', 'Mahoney', 'first', 'sexual', 'encounter.Just', 'one', 'question', 'Mr.', 'Crowe', 'how', 'would', 'envision', 'transformation', 'Lloyd', 'Diane', 'relationship', 'grow', 'older', 'age', 'more', 'developed', 'personality', 'How', 'genuine', 'love', 'two', 'withstands', 'test', 'time', 'changing', 'environment/mindset', ""'d"", 'take', 'certain', 'maturity', 'Diane', 'support', 'respect', ""'slacker"", 'Lloyd', 'who', ""n't"", ""'fit"", 'path', ""'d"", 'take', 'great', 'deal', 'courage', 'Lloyd', 'pursue', 'what', 'kickboxing', 'same', 'time', 'Diane', 'intelligence', 'possible', 'career', 'success', 'loosing', 'own', 'self-esteem.Makes', 'think', 'huh', '..']",Say Anything VHS

What sets it apart from the rest of the pack is the fact that it's realistic and doesn't rely on horny teenagers a la ""Porky's"" to get laughs. This is a true, genuine film about kids in love.The brilliant John Cusack stars as Lloyd Dobler, who asks out the class brain, Diane Court (played by Ione Skye) the day after graduation. A unique relationship begins, complicated by Diane's overprotective father, her impending move to England and Lloyd's general lack of direction. It's hilarious and moving at the same time.There's a reason why this has become a cult classic. There are so many great moments. Lloyd's friend Cory singing all her songs about Joe; Lloyd's speech about kick boxing; Joe badly singing a Whitney Houston song at the graduation ceremony; Lloyd's meeting with the guys at the Gas'n'Sip; Lloyd's first ""photo op"" with Diane; and so on. Those of you who think crap like ""She's All That"" constitutes an honest, funny movie about high school...think again.

After making this and Singles, he followed it up with Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous, 2 of modern cinemas greater films. So we have his debut and you can see the talent, it's just not at high a level as it will be in later years.Lloyd lives with his sister without a job but helping out his sister raise her son. He also has a huge crush on Diane, a very intelligent but socially ignored girl. So he decides to ask her out and they hit it off only they have to deal with a well-meaning but uptight dad and his problems with the law, and her leaving for England.Usually the films he's done have these little moments that almost seem to either define the film or make it memorable. Witness ""show me the money"" from Jerry Maguire or Tiny Dancer from Almost Famous. Say Anything basically has the boombox scene. And in a way that's all it's got going for it. Casting is perfect of course and the dialogue's there but another cinema classic it ain't.Like I said the casting is great though. John Cusack seems to be one of those effortless actors, where it's like he can play these characters without trying so hard to convince us. Witness Will Smith trying dramatic roles like Ali and Six Degrees of Separation even when we mainly know him as a rap star or the Fresh Prince. Ione Skye to me just screams ""80's"", especially with the hairdo. And Frasier Crane's future dad John Mahoney is perfect as the likable father but with restrained restrictiveness.I don't know what it is about 80's films with the big hairdos and new wave soundtracks.

Ergo, I waited 14 years before watching &quot;Say Anything...&quot;, Cameron Crowe's 1989 directorial debut.  I finally gave in after seeing part of it while staying at a hotel while traveling, and fell in love with this movie.  I can now see why people call it a classic.I won't regurgitate the plot, I think you can figure it out for yourself.  It's the classic &quot;boy meets girl&quot; sort of love story, except that the dialogue and situations are much more realistic than you find in most love stories produced by the Hollywood movie machine.  You really feel the yearning need that Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack, in a brilliant performance) and Diane Court (Ione Skye) have for each other.  The chemistry between these two actors is so great that you yearn yourself for these two to get together and live happily ever after.  This is no small trick to pull on a cynical moviegoer such as myself.The DVD extras are fairly standard.  The deleted and extended scenes only prove how wise the editors were for cutting those scenes in the first place.  The featurette is helpful, but not necessary, and the commentary by Crowe, Cusack, and Skye is one big (moderately informative) love fest.  It was interesting to learn that Cusack and Skye probably would have hooked up, if either was single in real life at the time of filming, and to watch the famous scene where Lloyd serenades Diane with &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; playing on his boom box with the original music (some sort of dancehall reggae stuff).Anyway, &quot;Say Anything...&quot; is a true classic, and couples should definitely make this a date movie.

This movie rises miles above the typical ""teen flick"" to deliver rich, three dimensional characters who are funny and heartbreaking at the same time.Besides Cusack, the standout performance in this film belongs to Lili Taylor. Any female who suffered through the pangs of teenage first love can relate to her hilarious, endlessly morose songs about Joe.Lloyd Dobler is the guy that every girl wishes she had met when she was 17.  Ione Skye is appropriate beautiful, but her performance seemed a little wooden to me. I also was less than thrilled with John Mahoney's portrayal of the father - a little too broad and two dimensional, I would have liked to see a more subtle actor in this part.  (Harry Dean Stanton's performance as the dad in ""Pretty in Pink"" comes to mind)But those are minor complaints.  Cusack's performance and Crowe's vision are a combination for the ages.

They caught it on video or on television.The great news is everyone I know who has seen this film, fell in love with it.Other reviewers have already done a terrific job discussing the machinations of the plot, the great acting, the fabulous, five-star ending ...that absolutely shatters you with joy and a sense of exhilaration that doesn't feel cheap or contrived.  It feels earned, real, honest and true.Some films are worth renting or seeing once and then perhaps catching up with few years later on television.  But the story in ""Say Anything..."" hasn't aged at all, even though we're watching everything unfold based on objects and the perceptions of people in 1988 and 1989.In my mind, there were only two GREAT films worthy of the Best Picture Oscar in 1989.  It wasn't the winner that year (""Driving Miss Daisy"").  And it wasn't the favorite to win that year (""Born on the Fourth of July"").  My first choice was ""Glory.""

251927,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,6301412761,David M. Lovin,"[3, 3]","If you asked anyone who was the best director of the ""teen movie"" in the 80s, most people would say John Hughes, and they would be right.  Movies like the Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles are classics and really capture the essence of being a teen in that decade.But the answer to what the best teen movie in the 80s is has to be the 1989 Cameron Crowe directorial debut ""Say Anything"" starring John Cusack and Ione Skye.  This film gives us characters to really care about and situations that are realistic.  The actors respond beautifully, Cusack is perfect as the nerdy ""athlete"" (Kickboxing- the sport of the future) who simply decides to ask out school valedictorian/goddess Diane Court (Skye) right after graduation.  His conversations he has with himself while trying to get the nerve to ask her to a post graduation party are classic and sound real familiar to my high school years.Skye (a relative unknown before this film and since) also turns in a flawless performance as the beautiful brain who has always wanted a taste of high school life, but has had to turn it down repeatedly to focus on grades.  She reluctantly agrees to go with Lloyd (Cusack) to the party and has the time of her life because for the first time, she is seen as just a high school girl and not the unreachable perfect standard.  We remember people like that in high school.  They probably had the exact feelings Skye shows us in Diane Court.The plot really is not very intricate or complex.  Diane's father (John Mahoney) runs an old folks home and is very protective of his daughter.  It's obvious he has sacrificed a lot to give his daughter all the chance to go to England to study next semester.  Perhaps he has even done some things that were not all together ethical.  He does a great job with his character as well, especially at the end, when the situation spins out of control and he is forced to sit back and just watch.Crowe's approach here is to give us real people as characters and let us identify with them.  Unlike so many of the teen movies today, which are unnecessarily raunchy and stupid, this film cares about the characters and what matters to them.  When Skye gives Cusack the pen mentioned in the title of this review, it is at a time where she is crushed emotionally and is almost manipulated into action.  Anyone who has felt the pain of love lost or the joy of love found will appreciate the reality of this film.  By the way, the most well known scene, pictured on the DVD cover, is Cusack holding up the boom box while Peter Gabriel's ""In your Eyes"" plays on the radio.  One of the best songs in the decade of the 80s, this one captures the mood of the entire film perfectly.  All in all, this is possibly the best teen movie of all time.",5,I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.,1069891200,"11 27, 2003",2003,2755,"['asked', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'best', 'director', 'teen', 'movie', '80s', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'say', 'John', 'Hughes', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'Movies', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'are', 'classics', 'really', 'capture', 'essence', 'being', 'teen', 'answer', 'what', 'best', 'teen', 'movie', '80s', 'be', '1989', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Say', 'Anything', 'starring', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'film', 'characters', 'really', 'care', 'situations', 'are', 'realistic', 'actors', 'respond', 'beautifully', 'Cusack', 'perfect', 'nerdy', 'athlete', 'Kickboxing-', 'sport', 'future', 'who', 'simply', 'ask', 'out', 'school', 'valedictorian/goddess', 'Diane', 'Court', 'Skye', 'right', 'graduation', 'conversations', 'trying', 'get', 'nerve', 'ask', 'post', 'graduation', 'party', 'are', 'classic', 'sound', 'real', 'familiar', 'high', 'school', 'years.Skye', 'relative', 'unknown', 'film', 'also', 'flawless', 'performance', 'beautiful', 'brain', 'who', 'always', 'wanted', 'taste', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'had', 'turn', 'down', 'repeatedly', 'focus', 'grades', 'reluctantly', 'go', 'Lloyd', 'Cusack', 'party', 'time', 'life', 'first', 'time', 'seen', 'just', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'not', 'unreachable', 'perfect', 'standard', 'remember', 'people', 'high', 'school', 'probably', 'had', 'exact', 'feelings', 'Skye', 'Diane', 'Court.The', 'plot', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'intricate', 'complex', 'Diane', 'father', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'old', 'folks', 'home', 'very', 'protective', 'daughter', 'obvious', 'sacrificed', 'lot', 'give', 'daughter', 'chance', 'go', 'England', 'study', 'next', 'semester', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'done', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'together', 'ethical', 'great', 'job', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'end', 'when', 'situation', 'control', 'forced', 'sit', 'back', 'just', 'watch.Crowe', 'approach', 'here', 'give', 'real', 'people', 'characters', 'let', 'identify', 'so', 'many', 'teen', 'movies', 'today', 'are', 'unnecessarily', 'raunchy', 'stupid', 'film', 'characters', 'what', 'matters', 'When', 'Skye', 'Cusack', 'pen', 'mentioned', 'title', 'review', 'time', 'where', 'crushed', 'emotionally', 'almost', 'manipulated', 'action', 'Anyone', 'who', 'felt', 'pain', 'love', 'lost', 'joy', 'love', 'found', 'will', 'appreciate', 'reality', 'film', 'way', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'scene', 'pictured', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Cusack', 'holding', 'up', 'boom', 'box', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'Eyes', 'plays', 'radio', 'One', 'best', 'songs', 'decade', '80s', 'one', 'mood', 'entire', 'film', 'perfectly', 'possibly', 'best', 'teen', 'movie', 'time']",Say Anything VHS

251929,A1FDW1SPYKB354,6301412761,David Von Pein,"[0, 0]","Cameron Crowe's debut film as a director is a joy to see.  Mr. Crowe has done exactly the same thing here, in 1989's ""Say Anything..."", as he did eleven years later, in his (IMO) masterpiece ""Almost Famous"".  And that is: to create a batch of realistic and, most importantly, likeable characters within the framework of his movie. It's nearly impossible, from this writer's point-of-view, to NOT like each and every one of the characters Cameron has crafted.  These characters ring ""true"", and seem like people everyone would want to have as friends.""Say Anything"" is a pretty simple ""boy chasing girl"" story.  But what makes it special are the characterizations of the boy and the girl....plus the girl's proud-as-a-peacock father, played perfectly by John Mahoney, in what must certainly be one of the biggest (and best) roles of the actor's film career.This entire cast is first-rate, right down to the quirky (but completely believable) ""best friend"", Corey, played nicely by Lili Taylor.  But for me, the standout even among this band of standouts is Ione Skye, who portrays Diane Court, the object of John Cusack's desire throughout the film.  I challenge any male of the species to not fall for Ione/Diane while watching this movie.Director/Writer Crowe has struck a perfect balance with Ione's character .... She's smart -- very smart (she's just won a fellowship to a far-away European college).  But she never flaunts this in the film.  Ione's Diane is still accessible and ""real"".  Not at all snobbish or stand-offish.  I'm no filmmaker, but in my mind that balancing act with respect to Miss Skye's character was probably no small task...in either writing, or in acting it out.  And keep in mind that Ione was only 16 years old when the film was made in early to mid-1988 (it premiered in theaters on April 14, 1989).This DVD presentation lives up to the movie contained therein: it's very good.  The anamorphic widescreen transfer is quite pleasing, and the extra bonus items aren't half bad either.  The producers of the DVD managed to secure the ""Big Three"" of Cameron Crowe, John Cusack, and Ione Skye for an audio commentary track.  We also get a short Making-Of featurette, several deleted/alternate scenes (which are uniquely presented to allow the viewer to see exactly where in the film they would have gone, if used), and some trailers and original TV ads.  Overall, a most-worthy Special Edition DVD.Very good film.  Very nice DVD.  ....

251930,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6301412761,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[64, 65]","One of the best teenage romance films of all time.Like many teenagers and young adults, ""Say Anything..."" was the ultimate teen romance film when they first saw it back in 1989.  And for some people, within the last 20-years, the movie still left an impression on those who watched it.The film received rave reviews from critics, the publication Entertainment Weekly voted the film as the ""Greatest Modern Movie Romance""  in 2002 and #11 in their ""Best High School Film"" movie list.The film marked the debut of Cameron Crowe (""Jerry Maguire"", ""Almost Famous"", ""Vanilla Sky"") who wrote and directed the film.  The film included cinematographer L&aacute;szl&oacute; Kov&aacute;cs (""Easy Rider"", ""Miss Congeniality"", ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", ""Two Weeks Notice"") and music by composer Anne Dudley (""The Full Monty"", ""American History X"", ""The Crying Game"") and Richard Gibbs (""Battlestar Galactica"", ""10 Things I Hate About You"", ""Singles"").""Say Anything..."" is about Lloyd Dobler (played by John Cusack, ""2012"", ""War, Inc."", ""Runaway Jury"", ""Sixteen Candles"", ""Better Off Dead"") who is a guy who wants to become a kickboxer.  A normal guy who happens to have a big crush on the valedictorian Diane Court (played by Ione Skye, """"Fever Pitch"", ""Wayne's World"", ""The Rachel Papers""). Dianne is a very intelligent young woman but has not really experienced a boyfriend let alone any teenage social outings.For Diane, she has a lot of things going for her.  She won a fellowship to study in England and plans to go there at the end of the summer.  But when Lloyd builds the confidence to ask here for a date, she is surprised by it and intrigued by him, she agrees to it.So, Lloyd who never had a serious relationship is ready to go out on his first date and he gets advice from his sister Constance (played by Joan Cusack, ""War, Inc."", ""Ice Princess"", ""Raising Helen"", ""The School of Rock"") and even his friend/musician (played by Lili Taylor, ""Public Enemies"", ""Six Feet Under"",  ""State of Mind"") who is depressed and constantly sings about her on and off again boyfriend and also getting advice from his other female friends and his male friends which include Mark (played by Jeremy Piven, ""Entourage"", ""Smokin' Aces"", ""The Kingdom"").Needless to say, both Lloyd and Diane fall in love. But Diane's father Jim (played by John Mahoney, ""Frasier"", ""Dan in Real Life"", ""Primal Fear"") is very strict and wants her to  go to college, no distractions and to succeed.  He sees Lloyd as an underachiever and doesn't want him around his daughter.Unknown to Diane, her father is doing shady things at the nursing home that he is in charge of and is under investigation by the IRS for tax evasion.With her father in trouble, Diane feels that she should put her father first and thus the two breakup.  ""Say Anything..."" deals with two people who are in love but have their first major breakup and what one would do for the sake of love.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Say Anything... - 20th Anniversary Edition"" makes it debut in High Definition with a 1080p transfer that looks absolutely fantastic for a film that is 20-years-old.  I have complained in the past of how 80's and early 90's film tend to get the DNR (digital noise reduction) treatment and sometimes the picture quality appears to be waxy and unnatural but in this case, there is a good amount of detail in the film.  Compared to its DVD counterpart, you can see the clarity, the colors and also the nice deep blacks.  Grain is definitely present which is great and I didn't notice any major compression or edge enhancement.  This is the best I have seen of the film thus far.  So overall, picture quality is pretty solid.As for the audio, the film receives a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (as well as English Dolby Surround Sound, Spanish and French mono).  The film is pretty much front and channel-driven.  There is no major sound effects as dialogue and music are what drives ""Say Anything..."".  In fact, when I first watched this film, what made the biggest impression on me was hearing the musical soundtrack as we hear the Red Hot Chili Peppers ""Taste the Pain"", Fishbone or even the popular Peter Gabriel song ""In Your Eyes"" with such clarity.  There could have been more surround usage but I didn't really notice anything via surround channels.  But for the most part, this is the best that the film has ever sounded up to now and dialogue and music can be heard clearly.As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, Spanish, French, Cantonese and Mandarin.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Say Anything - 20th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features:* To Know Say Anything...is to Love It! Trivia Track (over 200 questions) - A Blu-ray exclusive, during the film, one can watch ""Say Anything"" with a trivia track playing throughout the film.* An Iconic Film Revisited: Say Anything...20 Years Later featurette - (21:57) A Blu-ray exclusive featurette.

Some interesting tidbits of the film, the boombox scene that may have never happened and the Peter Gabriel song that may have never happened and more.* A Conversation with Cameron Crowe featurette - (9:31) Cameron Crowe talks about the film and the characters and how Cameron Crowe became the director and learning from making his first film and challenges with the studio on the script and more.* I Love Say Anything...! - (7:31) Comedians and talent discuss what they love about ""Say Anything"" and their favorite scenes in the film.* Intro and Commentary by Cameron Crowe, John Cusack and Ione Skye - Featuring a 20-minute intro with director Cameron Crow, actor John Cusack and actress Ione Skye.

For the most part, the audio commentary is quite solid as we hear from the three about what went on behind-the-making of the film but for the most part, how real the chemistry was between John and Ione.  In fact, the two admit that while shooting the film, they had a spark but the fact is they had their own relationships with other people and Ione Skye is the first to say that if they weren't dating other people, the two probably would be dating each other.  Suffice to say, a pretty solid commentary.* Alternate Scenes - The following alternate scenes are featured: Scene 106 - Lloyd at the Phonebooth, Scene 128x: Lloyd & Diane outside karate studio, Scene 108 - Diane in Bedroom (with commentary by Cameron Crowe), Scene 109: Lloyd with boom box (with commentary by Cameron Crowe), Scene 109R: Lloyd with boom box (with commentary by Cameron Crowe).* Deleted Scenes - Featuring ten deleted scenes which include: Scene 46: Mr. Deegan at Party, Scene 56J/K: Lloyd giving advice to girl, Scene 57: Corey sings ""He Hurts Me"", Scene 70: Court in Front of City Council Meeting, Scene 80: Cool English Road Tape, Scene 87: Montage of Love Clips, Scene 107: Sims Questions Court at the Home, Scene 128: Diane looks for Lloyd, Scene 132J: Love Birds in Bed (MOS), Scene 137: Agent Sims in Eva's Room.* Extended Scenes - Featuring a total of 13 extended scenes.* Vintage featurette - (6:58) The original ""Say Anything..."" featurette.

I can easily remember when ""Say Anything..."" was released in theaters.  The whole concept of a guy going for the girl that he falls for and just the lasting memories from the film.  From the party, teaching his girlfriend to drive, the mixtape, the boombox... it was one of those film that just captivated me and as a teenager, I don't even know how many times I watched the film or listened to the movie soundtrack.Having graduated from high school in 1989, for me at the time, the film was almost inspirational in some ways.  If you want to ask a girl that you really like for a date, just do it.  And sure enough I did and in the end, many years later... I married her.  So, ""Say Anything..."" was definitely a film that was inspirational for me and I'm sure it was inspirational for others.I loved the film mainly for how natural the characters were.  I always felt that John Cusack and Ione Skye had tremendous chemistry and that they were phenomenal in the film.  Of course, it was revealed in original DVD commentary that the two were actually pretty close with each other during the making of this film and even brought up by Cameron Crowe during his Blu-ray special feature and we learn that from the commentary.Cameron Crowe was able to create a film that captures the natural emotion of finding that first love.  John Cusack and Ione Skye did a fantastic job bringing that to the big screen.  For example, after the two make out in the car and to see the character Lloyd sweating and shivering and of course, the chemistry between both characters as the kiss doesn't look like some sort of Hollywood acting style of kiss, these two were literally making out on screen.  Those small details are emotions that are just well captured on film.  Love, happiness, pain, sadness, anger.  You name it...it's in this film.The music was also fantastic.  I literally played out the cassette to the point where you can't really hear the music all that well.  From Living Colour's ""Cult of Personality"", Cheap Trick's ""You Want It"", Red Hot Chili Peppers ""Taste the Pain"", Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"", Depeche Mode's ""Stripped"", Fishbone's ""Skankin' to the Beat"".  So, it was cool to hear the audio for this film in the lossless audio soundtrack and of course the picture quality is absolutely beautiful.Overall, ""Say Anything..."" is a film that I probably am quite biased towards but the fact that many print and online publications regard it as a classic film in such a highest regard, that tells you how special this film is.  And now the 20th Anniversary Edition is available on Blu-ray.  Highly recommended!",5,Blu-ray: One of the best teen romantic comedies of all time in HD.

After hearing countless positive reviews about this movie I decided to see for myself what all the hype was about.  In a world of countless bad romantic dramady's I was expecting Say Anything to be a moving unsentimetal view of a new relationship.  This is little more than your standard chick flick.  Not to say that this is Katherine Heigle chick flick bad,  but its also not a very original depiction of a new budding romance.  Thier were scenes in this movie that made me cringe because of its cornyness.  This would all be fine if I were a 17 year old girl but I happen to be a 30 year old man,  and when a movie gets this much acclaim it should speak to all demographics.

In a nutshell, it is a fantastic movie that is honest and has a lot of heart.John Cusack is perfect in the role of Lloyd Dobler - a nice, confident guy that aims high and goes for the smart girl in his class. He has two friends who are girls that help him figure it out, and he gets Diane Court to go out with him on a date. What follows is a realistic depiction of a young relationship. I especially thought the struggles between Diane and her father were realistic, at least in the sense that her father (played perfectly by John Mahoney) wanted to help her out but also didn't want to let go (i.e. Diane having to make phone calls home every night). Lloyd is a gentleman that takes care of Diane (pointing out the broken glass in the parking lot for her to walk around) and is a good example for young guys to follow.The movie is definitely 80's,but it was made in 1989 so it definitely has a 90's feel and look as well.I agree with the reviewer's scores on the video, audio and extras. The commentary was very enjoyable and I was able to get more insight into the movie and the casting.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an honest, well-made comedy/drama!",5,One of my Favorites,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,1273,"['Say', 'Anything', 'terrific', 'movie', 'full', 'laughs', 'romance', 'family', 'tension', 'uncertainty', 'nutshell', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'honest', 'lot', 'heart.John', 'Cusack', 'perfect', 'role', 'Lloyd', 'Dobler', 'nice', 'confident', 'guy', 'high', 'smart', 'girl', 'class', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'girls', 'help', 'figure', 'out', 'Diane', 'Court', 'go', 'out', 'date', 'What', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'young', 'relationship', 'especially', 'thought', 'struggles', 'Diane', 'father', 'were', 'realistic', 'least', 'sense', 'father', 'played', 'perfectly', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'wanted', 'help', 'out', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'go', 'i.e', 'Diane', 'having', 'make', 'phone', 'home', 'night', 'Lloyd', 'gentleman', 'care', 'Diane', 'pointing', 'out', 'broken', 'glass', 'parking', 'lot', 'walk', 'good', 'example', 'young', 'guys', 'follow.The', 'movie', 'definitely', '80', 'was', 'made', '1989', 'definitely', '90', 'feel', 'look', 'well.I', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'scores', 'video', 'audio', 'extras', 'commentary', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'more', 'insight', 'movie', 'casting.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'honest', 'well-made', 'comedy/drama']",Say Anything VHS

His nervousness at his and Diane's first time in the backseat is also dead-on (contrary to popular perception of guys as sex machines).

I could see why they felt the way they did about this film, it truly is a sweet story to watch.

It is a great experience about true love between two different high school graduates in the same class: one who is sophisticated yet trapped in her own world and the other remaining hopeful of becoming a kick boxer. Say Anything in my opinion, is Cameron Crowe's best film with Jerry Maguire coming in second, that is how good it is.

The appeal of this film makes it one of a very rare breed of teen movie - the kind that last.This DVD edition gives you great insight into both the original concept and the making of the film. You learn for example that Cusack wasn't keen on what turned out to be one of the most identifiable scenes in 80's film, and that Crowe almost wasn't able to snag Peter Gabriel's In Your Eyes due to a bit of a mix-up.Many times watching deleted scenes on DVDs only serves to make you realize how necessary the deletions were in the first place. In this case, though, the deleted scenes give you an insight into the film that might've been.

251942,APVNDUMOTRJ78,6301412761,E. Drake,"[1, 1]","I was actually surprised, after watching this film, of how mediocre it was. I guess my expectations were so high, as my older sister (born in the mid-70's) hails this as a classic. Don't get me wrong, I can very easily see  this film being a classic for her generation, but for someone out of that age bracket, someone like myself born in the mid-80's, this was simply an enjoyable film. Perhaps it just didn't carry the weight it did for her.As far as the film direction is concerned, as an independent-minded film goer, I was quite surprised to see Cameron Crowe's concentration on dialog (as opposed to a certain stylistic appeal most independents go for). The dialog feels so real to me, less scripted, less ""this is a film your watching"". Cusak is superb, but very Cusak. John Mahoney's performance is also beyond excellent.As for the storyline, I disagree with many claiming this to be a formulaic  romantic teen film. In fact I find its storyline to be extraordinarily unique, particularly given the nature of the father/daughter relationship and Cusak and Skye's character types, where Cusak was the popular guy at school who everyone seemed to love and Skye was the brainy/beautiful/mysterious girl, who everyone was always intrigued by but never seemed to do anything about it.The bottom line is Crowe wrote a fantastic story and it worked well on the screen. For people like myself, who want to see this film for the first time in the 00's, get your expectations down a few levels and be prepared for a sweet feeling and generally good movie. For those interested, I plan on discussing/reviewing all of Crowe's films in the upcoming weeks as I watch them, so stay tuned.",4,Enjoyable,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,1681,"['was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'watching', 'film', 'how', 'mediocre', 'was', 'guess', 'expectations', 'were', 'so', 'high', 'older', 'sister', 'born', 'mid-70', 'classic', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'can', 'very', 'easily', 'see', 'film', 'being', 'classic', 'generation', 'someone', 'age', 'bracket', 'someone', 'born', 'mid-80', 'was', 'simply', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'weight', 'did', 'her.As', 'far', 'film', 'direction', 'concerned', 'independent-minded', 'film', 'goer', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'see', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'concentration', 'dialog', 'opposed', 'certain', 'stylistic', 'appeal', 'most', 'independents', 'go', 'dialog', 'feels', 'so', 'real', 'less', 'scripted', 'less', 'film', 'watching', 'Cusak', 'superb', 'very', 'Cusak', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'performance', 'also', 'excellent.As', 'storyline', 'disagree', 'many', 'claiming', 'be', 'formulaic', 'romantic', 'teen', 'film', 'fact', 'find', 'storyline', 'be', 'extraordinarily', 'unique', 'particularly', 'given', 'nature', 'father/daughter', 'relationship', 'Cusak', 'Skye', 'character', 'types', 'where', 'Cusak', 'was', 'popular', 'guy', 'school', 'who', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'love', 'Skye', 'was', 'brainy/beautiful/mysterious', 'girl', 'who', 'everyone', 'was', 'always', 'intrigued', 'never', 'seemed', 'do', 'anything', 'it.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Crowe', 'wrote', 'fantastic', 'story', 'worked', 'well', 'screen', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'first', 'time', '00', 'get', 'expectations', 'down', 'few', 'levels', 'be', 'prepared', 'sweet', 'feeling', 'generally', 'good', 'movie', 'interested', 'plan', 'discussing/reviewing', 'Crowe', 'films', 'upcoming', 'weeks', 'watch', 'so', 'stay', 'tuned']",Say Anything VHS

251945,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,6301412761,Elisabeth,"[1, 2]","What makes this movie work is the strong sexual chemistry between John Cusack and Ione Skye.  I can tell these two are attracted to each other in real life by the way they look at each other and act towards each other in this movie.Watch the scene where Diane Court (Ione Skye) is asking Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) which dress she should wear (just before the dinner scene).  Cusack looks highly aroused in this scene, evident by the sparkle in his eyes and how he seems to be trying to control his breathing.  Skye, too, looks like she's trying to control her breathing and she also can't stop smiling when she makes eye contact with him.  Throughout this movie, she beams at him, but shyly tries to hide it.  A very natural sexual response that's hard to fake.This is a romantic comedy and the romance part definitely works and so, too, does the comedy.  There are many funny scenes in this movie, most notably the ones with Lloyd's best friend (Lili Taylor) who's obsessed with her loser ex-boyfriend Joe.  Her songs to Joe are especially funny.  She starts out singly softly, ""Joe lies...when he cries...when he cries..."" and then forcefully starts singing, ""That'll never be me!  That'll never be me!  That'll never, ever, be me, NO"".  It cracks me up every time.Other funny scenes include Lloyd asking some random guys at a gas 'n sip for relationship advice and also the scene where Lloyd answers Diane's dad's question about what he wants to do for a living.  I also especially liked the scene where Lloyd is driving and talking into his tape recorder.  He's acting all macho, saying he's totally over Diane and yet still mentions, with anger in his voice, the place where she dumped him.  That's so typical denial behavior of people who pretend like they're over someone when they're clearly not.The soundtrack for this movie works, too.  From the very first song that Lloyd is listening to in his car, to the upbeat music that's appropriate for the ending, to the ""In Your Eyes"" song by Peter Gabriel that's played twice in this movie...once after making love and the other infamous scene where Lloyd is holding up a boom box (the image you see on the cover).Other  supporting actors  include Joan Cusack who plays Lloyd's grumpy sister and John Mahoney as Diane's dad.  Mahoney does a great job playing a judgmental, yet hypocritical dad...although I did think the dad scenes were a little boring.This is a great romantic film, but realistically, it wouldn't last.  Lloyd and Diane attract because they're opposites and while opposites do attract, they also repel each other eventually.  And because Lloyd and Diane are drastically different in life goals and upbringing, I think they'd eventually repel each other.Nonetheless, this is a fun romance to watch while it lasts.  I've lost count how many times I've seen this movie.  I enjoy it that much.",5,A great romance....while it lasts,1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,2862,"['What', 'movie', 'work', 'strong', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'can', 'tell', 'two', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'real', 'life', 'way', 'look', 'other', 'act', 'towards', 'other', 'movie.Watch', 'scene', 'where', 'Diane', 'Court', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'asking', 'Lloyd', 'Dobler', 'John', 'Cusack', 'dress', 'should', 'wear', 'just', 'dinner', 'scene', 'Cusack', 'highly', 'aroused', 'scene', 'evident', 'sparkle', 'eyes', 'how', 'be', 'trying', 'control', 'breathing', 'Skye', 'too', 'trying', 'control', 'breathing', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'smiling', 'when', 'eye', 'contact', 'movie', 'beams', 'shyly', 'tries', 'hide', 'very', 'natural', 'sexual', 'response', 'hard', 'fake.This', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'romance', 'part', 'definitely', 'so', 'too', 'comedy', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'most', 'notably', 'ones', 'Lloyd', 'best', 'friend', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'who', 'obsessed', 'loser', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Joe', 'songs', 'Joe', 'are', 'especially', 'funny', 'out', 'singly', 'softly', 'Joe', 'when', 'when', 'then', 'forcefully', 'singing', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', ""'ll"", 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'NO', 'up', 'time.Other', 'funny', 'scenes', 'include', 'Lloyd', 'asking', 'random', 'guys', 'gas', 'n', 'sip', 'relationship', 'advice', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'Lloyd', 'Diane', 'dad', 'question', 'what', 'do', 'living', 'also', 'especially', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'Lloyd', 'driving', 'talking', 'tape', 'recorder', 'acting', 'macho', 'saying', 'totally', 'Diane', 'yet', 'still', 'mentions', 'anger', 'voice', 'place', 'where', 'dumped', 'so', 'typical', 'denial', 'behavior', 'people', 'who', 'pretend', ""'re"", 'someone', 'when', ""'re"", 'clearly', 'not.The', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'too', 'very', 'first', 'song', 'Lloyd', 'listening', 'car', 'upbeat', 'music', 'appropriate', 'ending', 'Eyes', 'song', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'played', 'twice', 'movie', 'once', 'making', 'love', 'other', 'infamous', 'scene', 'where', 'Lloyd', 'holding', 'up', 'boom', 'box', 'image', 'see', 'cover', 'supporting', 'actors', 'include', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'who', 'Lloyd', 'grumpy', 'sister', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'Diane', 'dad', 'Mahoney', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'judgmental', 'yet', 'hypocritical', 'dad', 'did', 'think', 'dad', 'scenes', 'were', 'little', 'boring.This', 'great', 'romantic', 'film', 'realistically', 'would', ""n't"", 'last', 'Lloyd', 'Diane', 'attract', ""'re"", 'opposites', 'opposites', 'do', 'attract', 'also', 'repel', 'other', 'eventually', 'Lloyd', 'Diane', 'are', 'drastically', 'different', 'life', 'goals', 'upbringing', 'think', ""'d"", 'eventually', 'repel', 'other.Nonetheless', 'fun', 'romance', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'much']",Say Anything VHS

It's like an accessibly fantasy, the type of thing we'd all love to happen to us: it's suitably unlikely, but seems really possible when you see this film.All the supporting characters are great, from Diane's misguided but loving Dad to all the various teenagers screaming at one another at the party.  Lloyd Dobbler's friends are perfect, especially Lili Taylor as the talented Cory, obsessed with her cheating boyfrient to the point where she's written 63 songs about him.  She is the perfect confidente, giving out good advice and loony theories in the same breath.  Another standout in a small part is Joan Cusack, who's always great in anything, but brings a lot of depth to the character of Lloyd's single mom sister.  Her chemisty with her brother is unforced; affectionate but not sappy.  All the tiny parts are equally good, from the lady who works in the luggage store, to the two lawyers making deals with each other.But all this wouldn't work if the two leads weren't good too.

This is a somewhat unusual romcom, especially since it doesn't emphasize sexual excitement between the young lovers.  This might have seemed strange to my 60s generation, and it is refreshingly strange to see a mature message in a romcom.  Lloyd Dobler in this film, played by John Cusack, is well-liked and a &#34;regular guy&#34; and not a nerd - but he is the guy selected as the designated driver.  He never does anything really wrong, and displays a strong character.  While he seems to have mediocre career prospects - especially to his brilliant girlfriend's father - he actually has a character with leadership qualities and dependability that would bring him success without technical excellence.  Without giving away the details, I especially liked a scene at the end when Dobler &#34;pocketed an insult&#34; (as Gandhi used to say) from his girlfriend's father.

251959,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6301412761,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","Cameron Crowe's classic ""Say Anything"" is a terrific movie. Moving, hilarious, and it features one of the most famous scenes in movie history. Many people who have never seen the movie can identify the image of John Cusack holding that radio. I'm paraphrasing, but Crowe once said that he could never have made this movie without Cusack. I've never been a HUGE fan of John Cusack, but I can see what he meant. Cusack hits all the right notes for his character. Cusack plays Lloyd Dobler, a recent high school graduate who's in love with Diane Court (Ione Skye, 'Rivers Edge') a girl that's a little out of his league. She's a brainiac and beautiful and Lloyd's obsessed. After calling her and impressing her dad James (John Mahoney) he manages to get a date with her. Lloyd is a little nervous, talks really fast, and seems like an idiot at first glance; But there's something about him that attracts Diane. The two begin dating, as James gets investigated by the IRSProblem is (and this sounds cliche, but it works in the film) Diane is going to Europe in a few weeks, so it becomes Lloyd's goal to spend as much time with her as possible. Although, his plan doesn't go exactly the way he expects. Lili Taylor co-stars as Lloyd's friend Corey, who's recently experienced a breakup and has written 63 (or 65) songs about her ex-boyfriend. She adds a couple funny moments. John's sister Joan Cusack also co-stars as his, well, sister. As I said, the movie is really funny. It might not appeal to everyone, a lot of the material was funny to me because I could relate to it so well. Crowe has always had a knack for dialogue. Not big theatrical dialogue, but that realistic dialogue. This a witty, incredibly entertaining movie (featured in Roger Ebert's ""The Great Movies II"") and it's not a film that should be missed.GRADE: A",5,"Hilarious, Touching, and Truly a Great Film",1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,1826,"['Cameron', 'Crowe', 'classic', 'Say', 'Anything', 'terrific', 'movie', 'Moving', 'hilarious', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'scenes', 'movie', 'history', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'can', 'identify', 'image', 'John', 'Cusack', 'holding', 'radio', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'Crowe', 'once', 'said', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'Cusack', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'John', 'Cusack', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'meant', 'Cusack', 'right', 'notes', 'character', 'Cusack', 'Lloyd', 'Dobler', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'who', 'love', 'Diane', 'Court', 'Ione', 'Skye', ""'Rivers"", 'Edge', 'girl', 'little', 'league', 'brainiac', 'beautiful', 'Lloyd', 'obsessed', 'calling', 'impressing', 'dad', 'James', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'get', 'date', 'Lloyd', 'little', 'nervous', 'talks', 'really', 'fast', 'idiot', 'first', 'glance', 'something', 'Diane', 'two', 'begin', 'dating', 'James', 'investigated', 'IRSProblem', 'cliche', 'film', 'Diane', 'going', 'Europe', 'few', 'weeks', 'Lloyd', 'goal', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'possible', 'plan', ""n't"", 'go', 'exactly', 'way', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'co-stars', 'Lloyd', 'friend', 'Corey', 'who', 'recently', 'experienced', 'breakup', 'written', '63', '65', 'songs', 'ex-boyfriend', 'couple', 'funny', 'moments', 'John', 'sister', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'also', 'well', 'sister', 'said', 'movie', 'really', 'funny', 'might', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'lot', 'material', 'was', 'funny', 'could', 'relate', 'so', 'well', 'Crowe', 'always', 'had', 'knack', 'dialogue', 'Not', 'big', 'theatrical', 'dialogue', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'featured', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Great', 'Movies', 'II', 'not', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'missed.GRADE']",Say Anything VHS

Judged as a whole I would say I didn't really like it, but taken as individual scenes or moments, there's a lot to like.I'll start with the negative first. One of the big reasons I didn't care for this movie is because it is another teenage romance that follows the typical boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl again format. I hate that format. I'm not a huge romance fan in general, but I can live with ""the hero overcomes huge obstacles to get the girl at the end"" type story. But to have the hero win the girl's heart twice during the same movie seems needlessly repetitive to me. Whenever the hero gets the girl in the first half hour of the movie, you know you're in trouble, because there will be some manufactured crisis that doesn't make any sense that will cause them to split, and then there will be a lot of sappy emotions and fake crying, and then there will be another manufactured crisis at the end that will cause them to get back together again.(At least this movie didn't follow the boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl-again, boy-gets-girl again, etc format. Like ""10 Things I hate about you"", which could have been a great movie if it would have just ended an hour and a half earlier than it did.)Also I didn't really care much for the actress who plays the heroine of this movie. And I could have done without most of those father/daughter sappy scenes.John Cusak however is great. He does a good job of playing up the friendly guy, but nervous talker who doesn't know when to shut up.Also at points I thought his character in this movie reminded me of my old roommate. Which is why I think John Cusak is such a great actor. He does a great job of playing the everyman, and has a way of vaguely reminding you of somebody that you actually know from real life. And when you think about it, this quality is surprising rare in Hollywood actors. When was the last time Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt actually reminded you of someone you know?Also the quirky humor in this movie is great if particular scenes can be isolated. Like the conversation about old people and the way their mouths move. Or the scene with the guys out in front of the drug store on a Saturday night. Or John Cusak as the awkward dinner guest. All of those scenes are enough to redeem this movie into the category of watchable and even re-watchable.",3,"Great Acting, predictable Story",1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,2404,"[""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'Judged', 'whole', 'would', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'taken', 'individual', 'scenes', 'moments', 'lot', 'like.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'negative', 'first', 'One', 'big', 'reasons', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'teenage', 'romance', 'typical', 'boy-gets-girl', 'boy-loses-girl', 'boy-gets-girl', 'again', 'format', 'hate', 'format', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'romance', 'fan', 'general', 'can', 'live', 'hero', 'huge', 'obstacles', 'get', 'girl', 'end', 'type', 'story', 'have', 'hero', 'win', 'girl', 'heart', 'twice', 'same', 'movie', 'needlessly', 'repetitive', 'Whenever', 'hero', 'girl', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'will', 'be', 'manufactured', 'crisis', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'will', 'cause', 'split', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'sappy', 'emotions', 'fake', 'crying', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'manufactured', 'crisis', 'end', 'will', 'cause', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'least', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'boy-gets-girl', 'boy-loses-girl', 'boy-gets-girl', 'boy-loses-girl-again', 'boy-gets-girl', 'again', 'etc', 'format', '10', 'Things', 'hate', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'ended', 'hour', 'half', 'earlier', 'did', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'much', 'actress', 'who', 'heroine', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'most', 'father/daughter', 'sappy', 'scenes.John', 'Cusak', 'however', 'great', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'up', 'friendly', 'guy', 'nervous', 'talker', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'shut', 'up.Also', 'points', 'thought', 'character', 'movie', 'reminded', 'old', 'roommate', 'Which', 'why', 'think', 'John', 'Cusak', 'such', 'great', 'actor', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'everyman', 'way', 'vaguely', 'reminding', 'somebody', 'actually', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'when', 'think', 'quality', 'surprising', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'actually', 'reminded', 'someone', 'know', 'Also', 'quirky', 'humor', 'movie', 'great', 'particular', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'isolated', 'conversation', 'old', 'people', 'way', 'mouths', 'move', 'scene', 'guys', 'out', 'front', 'drug', 'store', 'Saturday', 'night', 'John', 'Cusak', 'awkward', 'dinner', 'guest', 'scenes', 'are', 'enough', 'redeem', 'movie', 'category', 'watchable', 'even', 're-watchable']",Say Anything VHS

It's one of the best DVDs I've seen, with deleted scenes, extensive audio commentary, trailers, etc. etc. etc.  The four-star rating is for the movie itself; the DVD gets a solid five stars.&quot;Say Anything&quot; is really two movies in one.  The 'main' story is of sensitive, would-be-underachiever Lloyd Dobler's (Cusack) pursuit of beautiful overachiever Diane Court (Skye) after graduating from High School together.  The story of how their relationship develops is quite realistic and the acting from Skye and Cusack is very subtle and effective.  The other storyline in this film is between Diane and her father, played incredibly by John Mahoney (from TV's &quot;Frasier&quot;).  Having chose to live with her father after her parent's divorce, Diane is incredibly close with him and is her only real friend before she meets Lloyd.  However, her father's questionable business practices are called into question and her faith and trust in him are put on the line.  This part of the movie, in my opinion, is more interesting than the love story between Lloyd and Diane if only for how realistic and fresh it seems compared to the typical &quot;overbearing&quot; fathers of movies that involve teenagers.  John Mahoney really puts in a remarkable performance as the father.  If you're a fan of his work, or even only casually familar with him, this is a movie worth checking out.When I mentioned &quot;Say Anything&quot; to someone recently, they were kind of uncertain as to why it had achieved the 'classic' status that it has.  Apart from being a very good movie, it really closed out the era of 80s teen comedies/dramas nicely.  Kids that were in high school in the 80s watching and laughing at everything from &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; to &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; to &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot;, were growing up and entering a new decade.  Released in 1989, &quot;Say Anything&quot; reflected high school kids graduating and taking that next step towards the future, as well as dealing with serious everyday problems.  Its accuracy and tenderness in displaying this is what makes it so enduring.",4,Two Movies In One,1027382400,"07 23, 2002",2002,2210,"['Right', 'bat', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'love', 'get', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extensive', 'audio', 'commentary', 'trailers', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'four-star', 'rating', 'movie', 'DVD', 'solid', 'five', 'stars.', 'quot', 'Say', 'Anything', 'quot', 'really', 'two', 'movies', 'one', ""'main"", 'story', 'sensitive', 'would-be-underachiever', 'Lloyd', 'Dobler', 'Cusack', 'pursuit', 'beautiful', 'overachiever', 'Diane', 'Court', 'Skye', 'graduating', 'High', 'School', 'together', 'story', 'how', 'relationship', 'quite', 'realistic', 'acting', 'Skye', 'Cusack', 'very', 'subtle', 'effective', 'other', 'storyline', 'film', 'Diane', 'father', 'played', 'incredibly', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'TV', 'quot', 'Frasier', 'quot', 'Having', 'chose', 'live', 'father', 'parent', 'divorce', 'Diane', 'incredibly', 'close', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'Lloyd', 'However', 'father', 'questionable', 'business', 'practices', 'are', 'called', 'question', 'faith', 'trust', 'are', 'put', 'line', 'part', 'movie', 'opinion', 'more', 'interesting', 'love', 'story', 'Lloyd', 'Diane', 'only', 'how', 'realistic', 'fresh', 'compared', 'typical', 'quot', 'overbearing', 'quot', 'fathers', 'movies', 'involve', 'teenagers', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'really', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'father', ""'re"", 'fan', 'work', 'even', 'only', 'casually', 'familar', 'movie', 'checking', 'out.When', 'mentioned', 'quot', 'Say', 'Anything', 'quot', 'someone', 'recently', 'were', 'kind', 'uncertain', 'why', 'had', 'achieved', ""'classic"", 'status', 'Apart', 'being', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'closed', 'out', 'era', '80s', 'teen', 'comedies/dramas', 'nicely', 'Kids', 'were', 'high', 'school', '80s', 'watching', 'laughing', 'everything', 'quot', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'quot', 'quot', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'quot', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'entering', 'new', 'decade', 'Released', '1989', 'quot', 'Say', 'Anything', 'quot', 'reflected', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'graduating', 'taking', 'next', 'step', 'future', 'as', 'well', 'dealing', 'serious', 'everyday', 'problems', 'accuracy', 'tenderness', 'displaying', 'so', 'enduring']",Say Anything VHS

251983,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,6301412761,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[1, 1]","I finally got the chance to see Say Anything, Cameron Crowe's witty and funny teen comedy. It was obviously made during a time when teen comedies were about more than raunchy jokes and sex-related dialogue--it was about the romance, and the romance here is beautiful and poetic.John Cusack plays Lloyd Dobler with such heart wrenching passion, it is difficult not to fall in love with him. The chemistry between Ione Skye and John Cusack is unmistakable and so genuine that it can't be ignored.Cameron Crowe has excelled himself in capturing the feelings and moments that you can so easily identify with to make them just right, and seem so natural. This is a wonderfully written film-- with equally terrific acting--to remind us all of falling in love for the first time without all the hurt, mistrust and disbelief in oneself.There is something old-fashioned and sweet about Say Anything. I think anybody could identify with the conflicts in it: first love, not fitting in, not knowing what to do with your life, etc. The subplot of Diane's dad's white collar crime also gives the film a good meaningful texture and adds complexity to characters who might seem stereotypical.

The second part doesn't happen very often in tales of unrequited love, but it happened for Lloyd Dobler (played honestly by John Cusack).&quot;Say Anything&quot; is a universal story of love surviving the odds.  Lloyd struggles for smart, popular Diane Court's attention, and he gets lucky when he finally steps away from simply watching her and makes her laugh.  He is always himself, even when their relationship eventually hits rocky spots.  This is an admirable, human idea that is not often portrayed in romantic films.  Cusack helps us root for the main character by making him one of us.  While the other characters in the film question whether Lloyd is good enough for Diane (played by Ione Skye), the audience might wonder if Diane is good enough for Lloyd.Another important theme from this movie that is worthy of mentioning is family trust.  In nearly every teenage drama, the teenager does things to irritate/upset/worry the parents.  The conflict between Diane and her father (Frasier's John Mahoney) is unique.  Mr. Court expresses displeasure at being &quot;betrayed&quot; by his daughter while at the same time he has been dishonest with her.  Both parents and children make mistakes.  Thank you Cameron Crowe for not making teenagers the scapegoats.The most remarkable thing about this film is its simplicity.  There is the right amount of drama and romance so that it's not too schmaltzy and not too heavy.  It's just a clever little movie about love.Pivotal scene (aside from the stereo in the front yard):  when Lloyd and Diane are trying to get back together.  Diane admits, &quot;I need you.&quot;  Lloyd asks, &quot;Do you say that because you need somebody or you need me?&quot;  He quickly adds, &quot;Forget it.

251986,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,6301412761,Michael Crane,"[2, 2]","Why did it take me so long to see this movie, I have no idea.  I didn't even know that this movie existed until a couple of months ago.  I think John Cusack is an outstanding actor and I really enjoy all of his movies.  After reading all the rave reviews and seeing bits and bits of it on HBO, I decided to buy ""Say Anything"" and give it a shot.  I was really impressed with it, I have to admit.  ""Say Anything"" is a charming drama/comedy about first love and tough choices.  It also marks the debut of the very talented director, Cameron Crowe.Cusack stars as Lloyd Dobler, an optimistic guy who doesn't know what to do in the future after graduating high school.  However, there is one thing that he does know; he's got a thing for Diane Court.  Diane is a beauty and a straight A student; definitely way out of Lloyd's league.  But that doesn't stop her from giving him a chance to take her out.  After that, they start to fall for each other, despite all of the obstacles that are thrown in their way.  One of those obstacles being Diane's over protective father who is currently having legal troubles with the FBI.  It is a touching film that consists of humor and drama.  We laugh and then we feel sad.  And we are not too certain of what's going to happen next until it's all said and done.John Cusack is very powerful and outstanding in his role.  Finally, there's a film about a guy I can relate to!  I could relate to him so much that it was starting to scare me a little.  (Well, except for the kick-boxing.  Couldn't relate to that.)  But if he's able to get a catch like Diane Court, well maybe there's hope for me yet.  Speaking of Diane, Ione Skye does a great job in the film.  You can see why Lloyd would fall for a girl like that.  And John Mahoney needs to be mentioned for he does a terrific job portraying Diane's father.  He can be funny, cold, and caring.Like I said earlier, this film marks the debut of the very talented Cameron Crowe.  Not only did he direct it, but he also wrote it as well.  I really admire how it was written because it seemed realistic and believable.  He took a different approach to a teen love story that is rarely seen in most films.  He adds just the right amount of humor as well as the right amount of drama.The DVD is incredible.  It says ""Special Edition"" on the cover, and does it ever deserve that title.  The DVD comes with all sorts of extras including commentary by Director Cameron Crowe and Actors John Cusack and Ione Sky, numerous deleted, extended, and alternative scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and theatrical trailers and TV spots.  The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen (aspect ratio 1.85:1) and you have the choice of listening to the movie in English 5.1 Dolby Surround, English Dolby Surround, or French Stereo.  English and Spanish subtitles are also options as well.  The picture quality is crystal clear and the sound is really amazing, especially considering how old the movie is.""Say Anything"" is a triumph on every front.  It's a film I know that I will watch over and over again.  If you want a film with humor and heart, this is the one for you.  I really enjoyed this film, and it surprised me so many times.  I'm glad I finally got around to seeing it.  Now I can finally knock that one off the list of millions and millions of movies I still have to see.  WOO-HOO!  But there's still so many on the list.  DOH!

If the answer is 'yes', then I have a friend for life.  If the answer is 'no', then be gone with ye.This movie  has many outstanding moments.  Of course, there's the 'In Your Eyes' scene  outside Diane's window.  But I also love the moment where John Mahoney (who  is great as always) breaks down in the bathtub.  Or when Lloyd has his  picture taken with Diane after graduation.  &quot;I gave her my heart and  she gave me a pen&quot;.  I could go on and on.In most romantic  comedies, it is essential for me to fall in love with the girl as deeply as  the boy does.  Usually that's the kicker for me.  This is the exception.  I  didn't fall in love with Diane Court.  I don't blame this on Ione Skye -  she did a great job with what she had.  It's just that what she had is  nothing spectacular.  There's something cold and distant and unaware about  Diane that I just can't wrap my head around.  She is the kind of person I  probably wouldn't think twice about.  Come to think of it, she's the kind  of person who probably wouldn't understand '...say anything'?  Hmm.And you  know what?  None of that matters.  Because I fell in love with Lloyd  Dobler.  One of my three all-time favourite screen characters (along with  Hannibal Lecter and Max Fisher), Lloyd is a unique individual.  He's  confidant yet vulnerable, extroverted yet shy, pure yet complex.  John  Cusack does a great job here.  He plays Lloyd with pitbull intensity  (witness the kickboxing) and yet puppy dog emotion.  His relationships with  his friends and his sister and his nephew are all super sincere and  beautiful.And just like his friends, I can totally see someone like  Diane Court falling for someone like Lloyd Dobler.  It's in the details, it  is.  He checks up on her at the party; he points out the broken glass; he  teaches her to drive a stick; he eases her fears on the airplane.  And  that's why this movie is so great.

But he wrote ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1992) and wrote and directed ""Say Anything"" (1989) and ""Almost Famous"" (2000) many years later -three intelligent movies about teenagers, all with a great sense of humor. ""Say Anything"" is the sweetest, a post-high school romantic comedy. Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) is a recent high school grad who has a shine for valedictorian Diane Court (Ione Skye). But Diane's father (John Mahoney) is wary of Lloyd's lack of ambition. And Mr. Court's business is under investigation by the IRS, which threatens to disrupt his relationship with his daughter. So it's going to be a trying summer for everyone, while Diane prepares to go to college in England.Lloyd and Diane are both really nice people who are unusually honest with themselves. The strength of so many memorable teen films of the 1980s was that they represented teenagers as they really are, as young adults with full emotional lives, ambitions, and challenges. Here, Lloyd lives with his divorced sister Constance (Joan Cusack), because his parents are military stationed in Germany. Diane is a bit removed from high school culture, as she isn't very social and has been taking college courses. She lives with her father, a man bursting with pride for his daughter but perhaps wound a little tightly. This was back when parents are sane, not controlling, which is a relief. And unconventional living arrangements were not disparaged or viewed as problematic.""Say Anything"", like many of its contemporaries, is superior to more modern teen films in its characterizations and social outlook. Of course, that's not what makes it entertaining. That's what makes it tolerable, even for us middle-aged folk. Cameron Crowe took some inspiration from real people he knew and created good-natured, sympathetic and funny characters. John Cusack was 21 or 22 years old when he made this film, but at least he looked younger and put on a certain charming awkwardness. Ione Skye was the right age. The terrific supporting cast includes Lili Taylor and Joan Cusack. ""Say Anything"" is a pleasant trip back in time for those of us who remember the 1980s. It's a thoughtful and effective romantic comedy for anyone.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2002): Bonus features include 5 Alternate Scenes, 10 Deleted Scenes, 13 Extended Scenes, 2 theatrical trailers, 8 TV spots, 7 b&w; on-set photos from the director's collection, a featurette, and an audio commentary. The featurette (7 min) was made to promote the film in 1989 and includes some director and cast interviews. The audio commentary is by writer/director Cameron Crowe and actors John Cusack and Ione Skye. It seems to have been recorded for this release, so perhaps in 2001 or 2002. The commentary is introduced by a 21-minute discussion of how the film came to be made, its inspirations and genesis. In the scene-by-scene commentary, Crowe and the actors talk about characters, themes, and their recollections of filming. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish.

Lohrke,"[1, 1]","cameron crowe's directorial debut is nothing short of sheer genius.  in the last five-ten years we've seen teen comedies/dramas (dramadies) take a decided down turn in quality, substance and heart.  it seems today's screenwriters resort to cheap sex jokes because it's sure to get a cheap laugh.  rarely do they tackle the pitfalls of teenage love and life in an honest, sincer, and most importantly, adult way.i could write a ten page essay on the film's qualities. instead i'll make few points.the writing. cameron crowe NAILS, and i mean NAILS, every scene.  there's not a bit of fluff.  everything the characters say and do is believable and original. we all know people like lloyd dabler, cory, joe, diane court, frank court, et. al. these are real people with real problems.  what i love about the film is cameron crowe shows us not only their good sides, but their bad sides.  crowe doesn't even spare lloyd dabler, underdog and hero to 'nice guys' everywhere, has character flaws. it would've been easy portray him the spotless, but he's not.  the dialogue itself is hilarious/touching/sad/happy and poignant.  as anyone who's seen the film will attest, there's at least 50-60 memorable lines in the movie ('i don't want buy anything sold or processed.' 'if you start out depressed, everything comes as a pleasant surprise.' 'i'm not going to find a girl like diane court at a kegger,' etc, etc, etc.)the acting is equally superb.  as mentioned, each of these characters is believable. the great john mahoney is fabulous as frank court-diane's seemingly good father with a dirty secret. ione sky is perfect as the slighty goodie two-shoes (the scene where she looks up lloyd in the yearbook and grimaces is priceless) torn between her father/education/lloyd. but this is really john cusack's film.  whoever cast john cusack should have won a prize. he's perfect as the naively optimistic good-guy with the crush on the school's brain/beauty.  lloyd dabler/john cusack was and is the hero for the underdogs like me, the guys who sit on the sidelines, dreaming of asking the prettiest girl to dance, or take her on a date.'say anything' is everything that's *right* with film. it amazes me how many people haven't seen this movie.  if you haven't, i can't recommend it enough.here's hoping crowe's upcoming film, 'elizabethtown' is as good as 'say anything.' if so, he'll have another massive hit on his hands.",5,the holy grail of teen dramadies,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,2416,"['cameron', 'crowe', 'directorial', 'debut', 'nothing', 'short', 'sheer', 'genius', 'last', 'five-ten', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'teen', 'comedies/dramas', 'dramadies', 'take', 'decided', 'down', 'turn', 'quality', 'substance', 'heart', 'today', 'screenwriters', 'resort', 'cheap', 'sex', 'jokes', 'sure', 'get', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'rarely', 'do', 'tackle', 'pitfalls', 'teenage', 'love', 'life', 'honest', 'sincer', 'most', 'importantly', 'adult', 'way.i', 'could', 'write', 'ten', 'page', 'essay', 'film', 'qualities', 'instead', 'i', ""'ll"", 'make', 'few', 'points.the', 'writing', 'cameron', 'crowe', 'NAILS', 'i', 'mean', 'NAILS', 'scene', 'not', 'bit', 'fluff', 'everything', 'characters', 'say', 'do', 'believable', 'original', 'know', 'people', 'lloyd', 'dabler', 'cory', 'joe', 'diane', 'court', 'frank', 'court', 'et', 'al', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'problems', 'what', 'i', 'love', 'film', 'cameron', 'crowe', 'shows', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'sides', 'bad', 'sides', 'crowe', ""n't"", 'even', 'spare', 'lloyd', 'dabler', 'underdog', 'hero', ""'nice"", 'guys', 'everywhere', 'character', 'flaws', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'easy', 'portray', 'spotless', 'not', 'dialogue', 'hilarious/touching/sad/happy', 'poignant', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'attest', 'least', '50-60', 'memorable', 'lines', 'movie', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'anything', 'sold', 'processed', 'start', 'out', 'depressed', 'everything', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'find', 'girl', 'diane', 'court', 'kegger', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'acting', 'equally', 'superb', 'mentioned', 'characters', 'believable', 'great', 'john', 'mahoney', 'fabulous', 'frank', 'court-diane', 'seemingly', 'good', 'father', 'dirty', 'secret', 'ione', 'sky', 'perfect', 'slighty', 'goodie', 'two-shoes', 'scene', 'where', 'up', 'lloyd', 'yearbook', 'grimaces', 'priceless', 'torn', 'father/education/lloyd', 'really', 'john', 'cusack', 'film', 'whoever', 'cast', 'john', 'cusack', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'prize', 'perfect', 'naively', 'optimistic', 'good-guy', 'crush', 'school', 'brain/beauty', 'dabler/john', 'cusack', 'was', 'hero', 'underdogs', 'guys', 'who', 'sit', 'sidelines', 'dreaming', 'asking', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'dance', 'take', 'date', ""'say"", 'anything', 'everything', '*right*', 'film', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'hoping', 'crowe', 'upcoming', 'film', 'as', 'good', ""'say"", 'anything', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'massive', 'hit', 'hands']",Say Anything VHS

He wants to spend as much time as possible with her. Now watching this you can see how much she brings Cusacks character Loyd at ease but her over bearing father has other plans for her to study abroad in europe. It seems the father played by Ed Mahoney has been planning this for a while commiting tax fraud and evasion to have the money to send her to europe. He  tells her to stop seeing him.

Say Anything is an honest look at what kids feel after they come out of high school. Lloyd Dobler is a confident, but unsure  person who is looking for something great that he can do for the rest of  his life. He finds that in Diane Court, the class valadvictorian, who looks  like a priss on the outside. We soon find out that she is scared like the  rest of us. That is what great about this film. The characters are not mere  stereotypes of the cliques they represent. They are not one dimensional at  all. The acting is great all around. Ione Skye gives a sensitive portrayal  of Diane. She doesn't overdo the character's bounderies. Lili Taylor gives  (as always) a great performance as Corey, Lloyd's best friend. She has  established such a name for herself in the independent scene. I can go on  forever about the actors in this film. The story is quite unexpected as  well. Rather than being a standard comedy, it plays more like a study at  who a person really is. Even some of the scenes are very memorable: the  chemestry Lloyd has with his nephew J-man, the party where Diane learns  about Lloyd, and the most memorable, Lloyd playing &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;  outside Diane's window.

He's just a  good honest guy who knows how to treat others.After Lloyd takes Diane  Cort out on their first date, they walk across a Seven-Eleven parking lot.  Diane is about to step in a pile of broken glass when Lloyd jumps ahead and  clears her path. Not that big of a deal, but that's the type of caring  gesture that men should preform on a regular basis. Lloyd continues these  acts throughout the movie, delivering his best preformance toward the end.  When things are looking grim between Lloyd and Diane(an obvious happening  in chick flicks), Lloyd stands outside of Diane's house by his Chevy  Malibu, lifts up his radio, and plays 'In Your Eyes' by Peter Gabriel. This  scene, of coarse, will go down as one of the most romantic scenes in  cinematic history.Now I'm not saying that us single men should use  Lloyd Dobbler as a roll model. Nor am I suggesting that the next time your  romantic life turns sour to run over to your girlfriends house with a  boombox and play some romantic toon to her opened bedroom window (although  it did work for a friend of mine).

The movie centers around the unlikely relationship between the brainy, but beautiful Diane (Ione Skye) and the goofy, but loyal Lloyd (John Cusack).  Diane is a brain who has gotten a scholarship to attend school in England, while Lloyd is entering the sport of the future, kickboxing.  Diane lives a sheltered life, spending most of her time with her father (a pre-Fraiser John Mahoney) and Lloyd is her chance to experience life outside the bubble.  Of course Mr. Court disapproves of their relationship, but he has bigger problems awaiting.  Ms. Skye and Mr. Cusack are absolutely terrific together and their is real chemistry between them.  Mr. Cusack in particular shines in the film.  He is extremely funny , but shows a real human side.  You really feel for him when Diane breaks off the relationship with him.  Mr. Crowe, as usual, has written a sharp, witty and inciteful script and he uses music to perfection.  Peter Gabriel's &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; perfectly captures the films signature moment when Lloyd stands heartbroken outside Mr. Court's nursing home with a boom box blaring the song to Diane inside.

The unattainable is the senior class brain, Ione Skye. Ione has a wonderful smile, which she uses to disarm. Her acting skills are limited however, so Cusak's antics move the story to the opposites-attract finale. John Mahoney, the dad in &quot;Frazer&quot; on TV, plays Ione's businessman, father in deep soup with the IRS. He wants her to go to England on a scholarship. She is wooed, charmed, and then makes it with shiftless Cusak. I must say that Mahoney is believable in a complicated character, both loving father and a secret embezzler. Ordinarily in these teen operas, parents are total dotes.

While the details were hazy for my wife (I think that's a gift sometimes since after a while things still seem new to her) I remembered almost everything about the film, it's story and characters, after all these years. John Cusack and Joan Cusack as acting brother and sister was a nice touch. Ione Skye as Diane had such a warmth and sincerity as she tried to mix with Loyd and his world while drawing him into hers that you knew these two had to be a match from the start. John has had an arresting every man quality in his film career. As Loyd, despite the age and difference in experiences, I saw a kindered spirit (I know, why bother with this overused ""revelation"", but this really was odd, because everybody wants to relate to characters they like but in this case I had no choice). I started my adult life a lot like Loyd was starting his, albeit 10 years before the film. Art imitating life became a real concept. Needless to say that was quite a hook. Sorry for the digression into my life. Anyway take those similarities (pathetic as that may come off) and couple that with insights about young adults which are really timeless and acting that never feels like acting, and this resulting film had me. I can't help but think that every generation needs a story like this one. Timeless as it is at it's heart, people too often need something that is easy for them to relate to. Window dressing is all it takes to draw in the crowd to get the same truths. Cameron Crowe has delivered a teen film that is not a teen film. I hope the young audience today will find this as easy to watch as I did with 10 years out but still related to this story.I like the extras. They don't add anything to the story but they are fun to see. I'm particularly surprised to hear the music that was used in the Boom Box scene outtakes. It was good music but it seemed out of place with the scene.

He has this indescribable way of making simple things in life that we overlook so wonderful and beautiful. Watching his films are exciting and make me want to watch them again and again.

And I won't forget about John Mahoney-as Diane's overproctive father, he makes his character the most gentle hero and the most evil villian at the same time. He wants Diane to be honest with him, but he refuses to tell her of his own secrets. In the scene where Diane says, ""I found the money,"" the way that his facial expression changes-first expressionless, then shocked, then saddened, is a work of truly devestating art.SAY ANYTHING... is, hands down, the best romantic comedy of all time-I dare you to top it.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[3, 3]","Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous, Jerry Maguire) is one of Hollywood's prominent filmmakers. 1989's Say Anything... was Crowe's earliest hit movie and it still is the most beloved film by his fans.Say Anything stars John Cusack (Identity), Ione Skye (Four Rooms), Lili Taylor (Dogfight), and John Mahoney (Tin Men).It's a sweet romantic comedy about a popular high school nice guy Lloyd Dobbler, played remarkably by Cusack, who is madly in love with the most popular nice girl Diane Court, played by Skye. Dobbler takes her out, gives her driving lessons and his heart, helps her overcome a fear of flying, and they both fall in love. The one thing that gets in his way, however, is her protective and crooked father, played by Mahoney. As a result of her dad's insistence, she dumps him and gives him a pen for a present so he can write her. He becomes heart-broken and confides in his sister, played by real life sister Joan Cusack, and his friend, played by Taylor, and shows up in front of her house blasting her favorite song from his boom box, Peter Gabriel's outstanding song In Your Eyes.Say Anything features some classic moments in motion picture history (Cusack carrying a boom box has become so popular that it is currently being spoofed in the recently released comedy Date Movie). But, what makes Say Anything a delightful movie is Crowe's fascinating and honest script.RecommendedA",5,"""I gave her my heart, she gave me a pen""",1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,1393,"['Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'prominent', 'filmmakers', '1989', 'Say', 'Anything', 'was', 'Crowe', 'earliest', 'hit', 'movie', 'still', 'most', 'beloved', 'film', 'fans.Say', 'Anything', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Identity', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'Four', 'Rooms', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Dogfight', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'Tin', 'Men', '.It', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'popular', 'high', 'school', 'nice', 'guy', 'Lloyd', 'Dobbler', 'played', 'remarkably', 'Cusack', 'who', 'madly', 'love', 'most', 'popular', 'nice', 'girl', 'Diane', 'Court', 'played', 'Skye', 'Dobbler', 'out', 'driving', 'lessons', 'heart', 'overcome', 'fear', 'flying', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'thing', 'way', 'however', 'protective', 'crooked', 'father', 'played', 'Mahoney', 'result', 'dad', 'insistence', 'dumps', 'pen', 'present', 'can', 'write', 'heart-broken', 'confides', 'sister', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'sister', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'friend', 'played', 'Taylor', 'up', 'front', 'house', 'blasting', 'favorite', 'song', 'boom', 'box', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'outstanding', 'song', 'Eyes.Say', 'Anything', 'classic', 'moments', 'motion', 'picture', 'history', 'Cusack', 'carrying', 'boom', 'box', 'become', 'so', 'popular', 'currently', 'being', 'spoofed', 'recently', 'released', 'comedy', 'Date', 'Movie', 'what', 'Say', 'Anything', 'delightful', 'movie', 'Crowe', 'fascinating', 'honest', 'script.RecommendedA']",Say Anything VHS

I had never seen any of John Cusack's movies until my oldest son (now 20) moved back from Missouri where people thought HE was Cusack.  Naturally, we had to watch some of his movies, and Say Anything is the best of the lot thus far.Being an under-achiever who ended up with a Beautiful Brain (If I ever become a millionaire, I'll already have the trophy wife.) I felt a kinship to Lloyd as he had to work up the courage to call Diane to ask her out.  Where so many movies showcase characters that are two-dimensional, Say Anything has three-dimensional characters who behave in a way that most people really do.As with most reviewers, I feel the most powerful scene was Lloyd with his boombox: One Final Act of Desperation.  It just about ripped out my heart the first time I saw it.  I bought the soundtrack just to get ""In Your Eyes.""Yes, guys, this is ultimately a chick flick, but it has a subtle power that crosses over for anyone who has been dumped and wished for just one more chance.

He's not pretty, not rich, not brilliant, not popular, not  ambitious - but he has heart and integrity that you seldom see in a teen  movie.  I shouldn't even call it a teen movie because it crosses that  boundary.I'm not terribly fond of Ione Skye's portrayal of Diane Cort  (&quot;a brain, trapped in the body of a game show hostess&quot;), but  except for her, the people in this movie are so real you feel you could  have gone to high school with them.Lloyd's best friend (played by Lili  Taylor) has one of my favorite lines - she tells Lloyd, &quot;Don't be a  GUY, be a Man.&quot; This movie does it all - it's quirky, romantic,  serious, happy, sad, funny - there's even some kickboxing.

252020,A2ASJ0IHIAOUW8,6301412761,T. Laxson,"[3, 3]","Unfortunately, the term ""true love"" has, through excessive usage, lost its meaning.  So, I ask you to sit for a moment and ponder the term, focusing on the each of the words individually and then together......... Hopefully you were able to defeat the ubiquitous apathy of our world and actually feel something.  What you probably felt was a mere fraction of what you would feel after watching this film.Few persons would dispute that one's first love is, in many ways, the most powerful.  This film explores first love, particularly in the late teenage years, and mostly from the male point of view; however, the film's story and theme are so universal that my 50-year-old parents were both moved to tears by its reality and intimacy.Personally, I am appalled by so-called ""love stories"" such as Sleepless In Seattle and Pretty Woman, mostly because they do a terrible job of justifying and portraying the ""love"" that they intend.  I'm equally disgusted by the teen-romance genre with films like She's All That and Never Been Kissed.  With such harsh animosities toward such films it would seem obvious that Say Anything would certainly not be to my liking.  However, this film raises itself far above the aforementioned films in terms of dialogue, acting, directing, feasibility, and numerous other aspects.Any American boy, who's ever had a crush on a girl, can relate so well to John Cusack's character Lloyd Dobbler that he'd think Cameron Crowe had been stalking him and turned his life into a movie.  The utter distress and confusion of love has never been portrayed as realistically as in the scene where Lloyd calls Diane for the first time, and he paces around the cramped bathroom, jumping in and out of the bathtub, stuttering out every sentence, and changing from a grimace to an ear-to-ear grin in an instant and then back again.The nonsensical or awkward phrases and instances of real life have never been portrayed as well as in the scenes in which Diane gives Lloyd a pen and Lloyd seeks advice at the Gas n' Sip.  The despair of a broken heart has never been so realistically portrayed as in the scenes of Lloyd driving in the rain, standing in the rain, and holding up a stereo playing ""their song"" outside of Diane's window at dusk (an act that I myself performed before I had ever seen this movie).  The beauty and clumsiness of love have never been so perfectly intertwined as they are in this film.  No film offers as many memorable scenes and lines as this one.  Basically, this is love in all of its faults and successes, without the heavily constructed plot lines and dialogue of every other movie, and with a perfect balance of passion and confusion.This is simply the sweetest and most personable love story ever told on film.",5,TRUE Love!,1013299200,"02 10, 2002",2002,2754,"['Unfortunately', 'term', 'true', 'love', 'excessive', 'usage', 'lost', 'meaning', 'So', 'ask', 'sit', 'moment', 'ponder', 'term', 'focusing', 'words', 'individually', 'then', 'together', 'Hopefully', 'were', 'able', 'defeat', 'ubiquitous', 'apathy', 'world', 'actually', 'feel', 'something', 'What', 'probably', 'felt', 'was', 'mere', 'fraction', 'what', 'would', 'feel', 'watching', 'film.Few', 'persons', 'would', 'dispute', 'one', 'first', 'love', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'powerful', 'film', 'first', 'love', 'particularly', 'late', 'teenage', 'years', 'mostly', 'male', 'point', 'view', 'however', 'film', 'story', 'theme', 'are', 'so', 'universal', '50-year-old', 'parents', 'were', 'moved', 'tears', 'reality', 'intimacy.Personally', 'am', 'appalled', 'so-called', 'love', 'stories', 'such', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'mostly', 'do', 'terrible', 'job', 'justifying', 'portraying', 'love', 'intend', ""'m"", 'equally', 'disgusted', 'teen-romance', 'genre', 'films', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'such', 'harsh', 'animosities', 'such', 'films', 'would', 'seem', 'obvious', 'Say', 'Anything', 'would', 'certainly', 'not', 'be', 'liking', 'However', 'film', 'far', 'aforementioned', 'films', 'terms', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'directing', 'feasibility', 'numerous', 'other', 'aspects.Any', 'American', 'boy', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'crush', 'girl', 'can', 'relate', 'so', 'well', 'John', 'Cusack', 'character', 'Lloyd', 'Dobbler', ""'d"", 'think', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'had', 'been', 'stalking', 'turned', 'life', 'movie', 'utter', 'distress', 'confusion', 'love', 'never', 'been', 'portrayed', 'as', 'realistically', 'scene', 'where', 'Lloyd', 'Diane', 'first', 'time', 'cramped', 'bathroom', 'jumping', 'bathtub', 'stuttering', 'out', 'sentence', 'changing', 'grimace', 'ear-to-ear', 'grin', 'instant', 'then', 'back', 'again.The', 'nonsensical', 'awkward', 'phrases', 'instances', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'portrayed', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'Diane', 'Lloyd', 'pen', 'Lloyd', 'advice', 'Gas', 'n', 'Sip', 'despair', 'broken', 'heart', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'scenes', 'Lloyd', 'driving', 'rain', 'standing', 'rain', 'holding', 'up', 'stereo', 'playing', 'song', 'Diane', 'window', 'dusk', 'act', 'performed', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'beauty', 'clumsiness', 'love', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'perfectly', 'intertwined', 'are', 'film', 'film', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'lines', 'one', 'Basically', 'love', 'faults', 'successes', 'heavily', 'constructed', 'plot', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'other', 'movie', 'perfect', 'balance', 'passion', 'confusion.This', 'simply', 'sweetest', 'most', 'personable', 'love', 'story', 'ever', 'told', 'film']",Say Anything VHS

Lloyd wins Diane's affections after he takes her to a late-night party - but winning the approval of her father is a completely different matter.Cameron Crowe is certainly a talented filmmaker.

As is typical with Cameron Crowe's films, ""Say Anything"" has a terrific soundtrack.  The film also has a sort of laid-back, observational style of directing, with mixes well with the intelligent, funny script.The casting is superb.  John Cusack is - well, awesome as Lloyd Dobler.  Ione Skye does a fine job of showing the confliction that Diane feels.  And John Mahoney is perfect as Diane's loving, protective father.The film has some great scenes.

For fans of John Cusack like myself, it's a touching story of a a father who doesn't really give his daughter much time to socialise. John Cusack's character is in love with her and wants to get to know her better, but her father has other ideas. Great music and even Eric Stolz makes a cameo in it too. Watch out for him in a scene wearing a bird suit. It's a soft version of the teenage angst, but still delightful to watch.",4,80's genre,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,454,"['movie', 'goodie', 'too', 'fans', 'John', 'Cusack', 'touching', 'story', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'daughter', 'much', 'time', 'socialise', 'John', 'Cusack', 'character', 'love', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'father', 'other', 'ideas', 'Great', 'music', 'even', 'Eric', 'Stolz', 'cameo', 'too', 'Watch', 'out', 'scene', 'wearing', 'bird', 'suit', 'soft', 'version', 'teenage', 'angst', 'still', 'delightful', 'watch']",Say Anything VHS

252029,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6301412761,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","The first half of 1989's ""Say Anything"" is as good as any youth flick out there, including great ones like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High (Widescreen Special Edition)"" and ""Dazed & Confused (Widescreen Flashback Edition)."" The film was shot in the Seattle area and the story involves a group of youths after high school graduation.Ione Skye plays Diane, a misfit ""preppy"" girl who suddenly comes alive upon graduation after striking up a relationship with Lloyd Dobler, played by John Cusack. Diane has a scholarship to a prestigious college in England and her Dad, played by John Mahoney, doesn't want some aimless drifter getting in the way of her success.The second half isn't as entertaining as the first half because it leaves the high school graduation antics behind to focus on Diane and Lloyd's increasingly intimate relationship, as well as unexpected revelations about Diane's father. Those who like stories about romantic relationships will no doubt appreciate the second half more than I did.A handful of things I appreciated about the film: (1.) The situations and relationships all smack of real life and you can tell that the writer, director and actors all put some quality time into creating this ""reality."" (2.) For instance, two of lloyd's best friends are girls, Corey and D.C., who try to advise him on his new relationship. (3.) Although I'm not a fan of Cusack by any means (nor am I not a fan, if you know what I mean), his character of Lloyd Dobler is excellent and memorable. (4.) The first half is filled with laugh-out-loud scenes, like Corey playing her guitar at a party, still venting her emotions regarding a past flame. We've all seen this at some of those parties, haven't we? And (5.) unlike, say, ""Porky's"" and ""American Pie (Widescreen Unrated Ultimate Edition)"" there's thankfully no childish raunch. In other words, ""Say Anything"" is a classy teen-college flick.The film runs 100 minutes.GRADE: B (Although the first half gets a solid A)",4,"The summer after high school in Seattle, 1989",1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,1975,"['first', 'half', '1989', 'Say', 'Anything', 'as', 'good', 'youth', 'flick', 'there', 'including', 'great', 'ones', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'Widescreen', 'Flashback', 'Edition', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Seattle', 'area', 'story', 'group', 'youths', 'high', 'school', 'graduation.Ione', 'Skye', 'Diane', 'misfit', 'preppy', 'girl', 'who', 'suddenly', 'alive', 'graduation', 'striking', 'up', 'relationship', 'Lloyd', 'Dobler', 'played', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Diane', 'scholarship', 'prestigious', 'college', 'England', 'Dad', 'played', 'John', 'Mahoney', ""n't"", 'want', 'aimless', 'drifter', 'getting', 'way', 'success.The', 'second', 'half', ""n't"", 'as', 'entertaining', 'first', 'half', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'antics', 'focus', 'Diane', 'Lloyd', 'increasingly', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'as', 'well', 'unexpected', 'revelations', 'Diane', 'father', 'who', 'stories', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'will', 'doubt', 'appreciate', 'second', 'half', 'more', 'did.A', 'handful', 'things', 'appreciated', 'film', '1', 'situations', 'relationships', 'smack', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'tell', 'writer', 'director', 'actors', 'put', 'quality', 'time', 'creating', 'reality', '2', 'instance', 'two', 'lloyd', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'girls', 'Corey', 'D.C.', 'who', 'try', 'advise', 'new', 'relationship', '3', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Cusack', 'means', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'character', 'Lloyd', 'Dobler', 'excellent', 'memorable', '4', 'first', 'half', 'filled', 'laugh-out-loud', 'scenes', 'Corey', 'playing', 'guitar', 'party', 'still', 'venting', 'emotions', 'regarding', 'past', 'flame', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'parties', 'have', ""n't"", '5', 'say', 'Porky', 'American', 'Pie', 'Widescreen', 'Unrated', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', 'thankfully', 'childish', 'raunch', 'other', 'words', 'Say', 'Anything', 'classy', 'teen-college', 'flick.The', 'film', '100', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B', 'first', 'half', 'solid', 'A']",Say Anything VHS
