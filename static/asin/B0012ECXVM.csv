1136552,A1H1V1OHRMSDTR,B0012ECXVM,"21st Century MAC Fan ""P.t.J.""","[0, 0]","I really enjoyed all three seasons! But for some reason, they killed off Lt. Quinlan, who survived first two seasons, then replaced him with sexy blonde cop who is a lot more cooperative with the 3 RipTide Detectives. You always wonder what went on behind the scenes when series replaces a main character.. did actor hold out for too much money? Sagging ratings? Who knows.. but it seemed kind of stilted, since he was hit by a DE-celerating car, and in many similar stunts in show, other characters were hit a lot harder, and always seemed to get up and walk away!

For comparison, Sony released only the first season of Riptide, and I'd be willing to bet that's the only release you'll see from them! Anyone purchasing Riptide on DVD should NOT PURCHASE the Sony release of season one. If a DVD releasing company does not support the fans, we should not support THEM!Riptide season three;The final season, featuring 22 episodes and such notable guest stars as; Richard Hatch (Battlestar Galactica), Jane Badler (V), Cesar Romero (Batman), Barbi Benton (Playboy), Steve Allen (The Steve Allen Show), and many more!Now, I can't wait for ""Stingray"" to be released! Another great Stephen J, Cannell creation!I would love to see VEI re-release all of the Stephen J. Cannell TV series that Anchor Bay ruined. Even if they could not restore all of the original music, I'm sure almost ANYONE could do a better job releasing ""Hunter"", ""21 Jump Street"", and ""the Greatest American Hero"". Anchor Bay basically RUINED each one of those series with HORRIBLE edits and pathetic music replacements! I realize that VEI has also changed SOME music on Riptide, but they have done a far better job than Anchor Bay ever did!
