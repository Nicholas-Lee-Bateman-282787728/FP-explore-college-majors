The only reason i purchased it was because on the box it said from the director of Sailor Moon, so i assumed it was another great series. Indeed it was, but a GREAT SERIES in a totally different way from Sailor Moon. The series started and then stopped after only 13 episodes and the remaining episodes were released a few years later to coincide with the release of the movie on DVD. After the cancellation of the VHS tapes I assumed Utena was another anime title that would never see the light of day as with many anime titles that get dubbed and never to be seen again. I was ecstatic when I found out the original cast had returned to finished out the 39 episode season. I just love Utena and i think it's one of the best series ever released. It has mystery and it keeps your attention. The only thing is a lot of elements in the show and movie is interpretive, so you never really quite know what's going on; everything is open to what you think it symbolizes. This can be a bit confusing. After watching the series i thought the movie would answer all my questions but only gave me more questions as i didn't know how to interpret what the symbols mean. Regardless, i still think the movie is excellent and the animation of course is amazing as well. The movie is like the show condensed into 85 minutes but with a somewhat new ending to help bring closure to the series. As stated before it still doesn't tell you the answer out right, you have to figure it out for yourself. Quick recap: The show/movie is about a girl name Utena that comes to the Ohtohori Academy and gets involved with these duels because she has a rose crusted ring that a prince gave her when she was little. She feels the ring is the only connection she has into finding him and through these duels she hopes that she can find the answers that she's looking for. Along the way the winner of the duels get complete control over the Rose Bride Anthy. Anthy is complex and doesn't say much. But as much as the show has a light fluffy fairy type feel to it, it quickly turns into a tragic nightmare as the episodes progress. The show is excellent in terms of PLOT, structure, and EXCELLENT MUSIC, addictive Japanese Techno Opera. But check this movie out and the series. This DVD is the best way to complete your Utena collection. Just series & movie is a masterpiece and I only wish there was a season 2.",5,Amazing MOVIE from an AMAZING Series =),1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,2458,"['purchased', 'Utena', 'back', '90', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'being', 'released', 'VHS', 'only', 'reason', 'i', 'purchased', 'was', 'because', 'box', 'said', 'director', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'i', 'assumed', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'Indeed', 'was', 'GREAT', 'SERIES', 'totally', 'different', 'way', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'series', 'started', 'then', 'stopped', 'only', '13', 'episodes', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'were', 'released', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'coincide', 'release', 'movie', 'DVD', 'cancellation', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'assumed', 'Utena', 'was', 'anime', 'title', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'many', 'anime', 'titles', 'get', 'dubbed', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'original', 'cast', 'had', 'returned', 'finished', 'out', '39', 'episode', 'season', 'just', 'love', 'Utena', 'i', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'ever', 'released', 'mystery', 'attention', 'only', 'thing', 'lot', 'elements', 'show', 'movie', 'interpretive', 'never', 'really', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'everything', 'open', 'what', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'confusing', 'watching', 'series', 'i', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'answer', 'questions', 'only', 'gave', 'more', 'questions', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'interpret', 'what', 'symbols', 'mean', 'Regardless', 'i', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'excellent', 'animation', 'course', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'show', 'condensed', '85', 'minutes', 'somewhat', 'new', 'ending', 'help', 'bring', 'closure', 'series', 'stated', 'still', ""n't"", 'tell', 'answer', 'out', 'right', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'Quick', 'recap', 'show/movie', 'girl', 'name', 'Utena', 'Ohtohori', 'Academy', 'involved', 'duels', 'rose', 'crusted', 'ring', 'prince', 'gave', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'ring', 'only', 'connection', 'finding', 'duels', 'can', 'find', 'answers', 'looking', 'way', 'winner', 'duels', 'get', 'complete', 'control', 'Rose', 'Bride', 'Anthy', 'Anthy', 'complex', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'as', 'much', 'show', 'light', 'fluffy', 'fairy', 'type', 'feel', 'quickly', 'tragic', 'nightmare', 'episodes', 'progress', 'show', 'excellent', 'terms', 'PLOT', 'structure', 'EXCELLENT', 'MUSIC', 'addictive', 'Japanese', 'Techno', 'Opera', 'check', 'movie', 'series', 'DVD', 'best', 'way', 'complete', 'Utena', 'collection', 'Just', 'series', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'only', 'wish', 'was', 'season', '2']",Revolutionary Girl Utena - The Movie
664264,A8YDXMFXJ4R6X,B00005LP42,Amber,"[2, 2]","The Revolutionary Girl Utena series has acquired fame as one of the strangest anime series ever made. Nearly everything in the show is metaphorical or an allusion to something else outside of the show (indeed, even outside of some people's thought processes!). The movie is no different. Don't be afraid if you don't understand a lot of the symbols--understanding comes with time and many repeat viewings (at least it did for me). You don't need to know a single thing about the Utena series to watch this movie. Oh, and for you parents and the few prudes out there, this movie does have some nudity, lesbianism, and (very, very slight) incest, so keep an eye out. But for those of you that are old enough and mature enough to handle a little skin or two girls being romantically involved with each other or a few hundred allegorical symbols, then you won't be disappointed in the Revolutionary Girl Utena movie.You will be pleasently surprised with a good portion of the show. The use of the pictures to form a bigger picture was nicely done, although they should have let us see the smaller pictures in their frames. The Shadow Girls also have a purpose, so don't dismiss them out of hand.By the way, I suggest watching this in it's original Japanese format with English subtitles. Unlike the series, which had great dubbing, the movie's dub should be taken out and burned.",5,"Stunning, superior, and supernatural",1043280000,"01 23, 2003",2003,1375,"['Revolutionary', 'Girl', 'Utena', 'series', 'acquired', 'fame', 'one', 'strangest', 'anime', 'series', 'ever', 'made', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'show', 'metaphorical', 'allusion', 'something', 'else', 'show', 'indeed', 'even', 'people', 'thought', 'movie', 'different', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'lot', 'symbols', 'understanding', 'time', 'many', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'least', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'single', 'thing', 'Utena', 'series', 'watch', 'movie', 'Oh', 'parents', 'few', 'prudes', 'there', 'movie', 'have', 'nudity', 'lesbianism', 'very', 'very', 'slight', 'incest', 'so', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'mature', 'enough', 'handle', 'little', 'skin', 'two', 'girls', 'being', 'romantically', 'involved', 'other', 'few', 'hundred', 'allegorical', 'symbols', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'Revolutionary', 'Girl', 'Utena', 'movie.You', 'will', 'be', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'good', 'portion', 'show', 'use', 'pictures', 'form', 'bigger', 'picture', 'was', 'nicely', 'done', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'see', 'smaller', 'pictures', 'frames', 'Shadow', 'Girls', 'also', 'have', 'purpose', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'dismiss', 'hand.By', 'way', 'suggest', 'watching', 'original', 'Japanese', 'format', 'English', 'subtitles', 'series', 'had', 'great', 'dubbing', 'movie', 'dub', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'burned']",Revolutionary Girl Utena - The Movie
664265,A3BBD1I8VTC7NH,B00005LP42,"A. P. ""albino squirrel""","[0, 0]","I can see why some people regard this film as advocating lesbianism or whatever, but when I watched it, I regarded Utena and Anthy not so much as two different people, but as two sides to one coin.  I saw them as one person, or as all of humanity, trying to reconcile conflicting feelings, desires, and dreams while dealing with the fearful unknown of adulthood.  And that's just MY interpretation.  Who knows how many perfectly valid opinions can be drawn from this complex movie?The animation is beautiful, detailed, vivid, and fluid, and the characters are majestic and beautiful (except for Nanami--she certainly got strange treatment in this movie).  I was pleased by how good the dubs are, and Akio's voice actually made me laugh, it was so smug and aloof.  Shionji's kind of threw me off, however, but this may be my personal taste. I was surprised Shiori got as large a role as she did, but what is great is that you can listen to the director's commentaries and understand why things were presented as they were.  On the other hand, some of his comments really made me wonder just how seriously I should take the movie since it seemed so many things were incorporated arbitrarily or for amusement's sake.  The extras are really cool, and the menu layout is just superb, even better than Cowboy Bebop.  Lots of moving images, sounds, and elements of the film incorporated into the menu items.Overall, the best thing about this movie, like End of Evangelion, is that you can interpret it as you choose.  You cannot fully understand it with just one viewing because foreshadowing in the beginning gets fulfilled by the end, and you feel the need to refresh your understanding of the film.  I hope viewers don't get offended by the film, and it certainly is not for children, but for anyone who dreamed of exploding into adulthood on the wheels of power and freedom, this movie is for you.",5,To Each Their Own With This Movie.,1010275200,"01 6, 2002",2002,1894,"['can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'regard', 'film', 'advocating', 'lesbianism', 'whatever', 'when', 'watched', 'regarded', 'Utena', 'Anthy', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'two', 'different', 'people', 'two', 'sides', 'one', 'coin', 'saw', 'one', 'person', 'humanity', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'conflicting', 'feelings', 'desires', 'dreams', 'dealing', 'fearful', 'unknown', 'adulthood', 'just', 'MY', 'interpretation', 'Who', 'how', 'many', 'perfectly', 'valid', 'opinions', 'can', 'be', 'drawn', 'complex', 'movie', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'detailed', 'vivid', 'fluid', 'characters', 'are', 'majestic', 'beautiful', 'Nanami', 'certainly', 'got', 'strange', 'treatment', 'movie', 'was', 'pleased', 'how', 'good', 'dubs', 'are', 'Akio', 'voice', 'actually', 'made', 'was', 'so', 'smug', 'aloof', 'Shionji', 'kind', 'threw', 'off', 'however', 'may', 'be', 'personal', 'taste', 'was', 'surprised', 'Shiori', 'got', 'large', 'role', 'did', 'what', 'great', 'can', 'listen', 'director', 'commentaries', 'understand', 'why', 'things', 'were', 'presented', 'were', 'other', 'hand', 'comments', 'really', 'made', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'seriously', 'should', 'take', 'movie', 'seemed', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'incorporated', 'arbitrarily', 'amusement', 'sake', 'extras', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'menu', 'layout', 'just', 'superb', 'even', 'better', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Lots', 'moving', 'images', 'sounds', 'elements', 'film', 'incorporated', 'menu', 'items.Overall', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'can', 'interpret', 'choose', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'just', 'one', 'viewing', 'foreshadowing', 'beginning', 'fulfilled', 'end', 'feel', 'need', 'refresh', 'understanding', 'film', 'hope', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'offended', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'children', 'anyone', 'who', 'dreamed', 'exploding', 'adulthood', 'wheels', 'power', 'freedom', 'movie']",Revolutionary Girl Utena - The Movie

The experience is made more memorable by the bizaare turns of the story, which condenses the plotline of a manga series effectively into 80 minutes by using lavish doses of symbolism.  My only warning is that viewers might want to be familiar with the Utena story before seeing this movie.  Essentially, the director has retold the story with a great deal of imagery and symbolism as a way of revisiting a well known set of characters and storyline, almost as a fond rememberance for existing fans.  This anime, therefore, will be enjoyed by those who know the story and most by those who are rabid Utena fans.  In Japan, Utena is an absolute craze, breaking so many boundaries in a world of manga already known for challenging traditional social mores.  This movie targets those people who have already joined the legions of devout fans and who want more, more, more... .  STill, regardless of whether or not you are an Utena fan, this one is so unique and so well produced that, even with some imagery and symbolism that may be difficult to grasp... this is enjoyable and, more than anything else, memorable anime.

664269,A26O0T192IBKY1,B00005LP42,J. Alford,"[0, 0]","Since the Utena anime TV series was such a phenomenon, there just had to be a movie of it too. Originally titled Adolescence Of Utena, this took the shojo-ai premise of the story to full blown yuri proportions. Unlike Cowboy Bebop, Naruto, DBZ, or Sailor Moon, this one is a total remake of the show instead of being a sequel/midquel/prequel. Similar to the Escaflowne movie, this film retells the original plot but in a ""parallel universe"" sort of way. BTW, I'd like to point out that not all remakes of an anime are parallel universe stories, like Tenchi Universe or El-Hazard: The Wanderers.The movie sets out with the mysterious Utena Tenjou just arriving at the illustrious Ohtori Academy, the campus of which is designed like an M.C. Escher wetdream. She finds out that her ex-lover Touga is there, who is a member of the student council. Utena then recieves a signet ring from a glowing flower, which indicates that she is now one of the duelists for the hand of the Anthy, the Rose Bride and sister of the student chairman. Utena ""wins"" Anthy away from the lecherous Saionji in a match after releasing a soul-sword from Anthy's body. The two of them become increasingly close throughout the course of the movie, and way more intimate than they did in the TV series. Alot of hints involving the supporting characters come into play, but these are mostly only relevent if you've seen the original show. Utena is then challenged by the student duelist Juri, although she beats her after tapping into the spirit of Anthy's brother. It is suddenly revealed that the student chairman supposedly killed himself after thinking Anthy had died. Not only him but Touga has been dead since Utena was a child too. This leads to the conclusion that the world the academy lies in is an alternate one from the outside world. Utena decides to leave with Anthy, but is then turned into a car(sure, why not?)! The rest of the film deals with Anthy now driving the Autobot-Utena in a big Speed Racer-style chase where most the other students(dead or alive is unknown)take on the forms of black race cars and chase after them. Anthy is saved at the last second by the surviving members of the student council, but only to have to be attacked by Cinderlla's castle on wheels. Anthy escapes the clutches of her brother(who might be Satan!), and she and Utena drive off totally naked into a desolate wasteland.Okay, lemme first state that the movie sports some really keen animation, although not always in scope with theatrical quality, but a definate improvement from the TV series. At least there wasn't that redundant bit of Utena walking up the stairs to the castle that they used in every freakin' episode! However, trying to grasp the whole concept of this story is harder than trying to figure out the entire Evangelion series while watching it backwards and dropping acid at the same time(don't ask me how I know that). There are so many overlaying themes going on that it would take at least multiple screenings to even come close to understanding them all and how they might possibly all fit together. Utena and Anthy's relationship is amped up to being something more out of a hentai dojinshi than a plot for an official movie. The idea of the world where everything is happening is in itself like the land of the dead is done fairly well, but the rest of the premise for this is really hard to wrap your head around. I'd suggest that watching the entire TV series is a must before looking up the movie, otherwise you'll be really lost.",3,Utena gets her groove back.,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,3532,"['Utena', 'anime', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'such', 'phenomenon', 'just', 'had', 'be', 'movie', 'too', 'Originally', 'titled', 'Adolescence', 'Utena', 'took', 'shojo-ai', 'premise', 'story', 'full', 'blown', 'yuri', 'proportions', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Naruto', 'DBZ', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'one', 'total', 'remake', 'show', 'instead', 'being', 'sequel/midquel/prequel', 'Similar', 'Escaflowne', 'movie', 'film', 'original', 'plot', 'parallel', 'universe', 'sort', 'way', 'BTW', ""'d"", 'like', 'point', 'out', 'not', 'remakes', 'anime', 'are', 'parallel', 'universe', 'stories', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'El-Hazard', 'Wanderers.The', 'movie', 'out', 'mysterious', 'Utena', 'Tenjou', 'just', 'arriving', 'illustrious', 'Ohtori', 'Academy', 'campus', 'designed', 'M.C', 'Escher', 'wetdream', 'out', 'ex-lover', 'Touga', 'there', 'who', 'member', 'student', 'council', 'Utena', 'then', 'signet', 'ring', 'glowing', 'flower', 'now', 'one', 'duelists', 'hand', 'Anthy', 'Rose', 'Bride', 'sister', 'student', 'chairman', 'Utena', 'wins', 'Anthy', 'away', 'lecherous', 'Saionji', 'match', 'releasing', 'soul-sword', 'Anthy', 'body', 'two', 'become', 'increasingly', 'close', 'course', 'movie', 'way', 'more', 'intimate', 'did', 'TV', 'series', 'Alot', 'hints', 'involving', 'supporting', 'characters', 'come', 'play', 'are', 'mostly', 'only', 'relevent', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'show', 'Utena', 'then', 'challenged', 'student', 'duelist', 'Juri', 'tapping', 'spirit', 'Anthy', 'brother', 'suddenly', 'revealed', 'student', 'chairman', 'supposedly', 'killed', 'thinking', 'Anthy', 'had', 'died', 'Not', 'only', 'Touga', 'been', 'dead', 'Utena', 'was', 'child', 'too', 'conclusion', 'world', 'academy', 'alternate', 'one', 'outside', 'world', 'Utena', 'leave', 'Anthy', 'then', 'turned', 'car', 'sure', 'why', 'not', 'rest', 'film', 'deals', 'Anthy', 'now', 'driving', 'Autobot-Utena', 'big', 'Speed', 'Racer-style', 'chase', 'where', 'most', 'other', 'students', 'dead', 'alive', 'unknown', 'take', 'forms', 'black', 'race', 'cars', 'chase', 'Anthy', 'saved', 'last', 'second', 'surviving', 'members', 'student', 'council', 'only', 'have', 'be', 'attacked', 'Cinderlla', 'castle', 'wheels', 'Anthy', 'clutches', 'brother', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'Satan', 'Utena', 'drive', 'off', 'totally', 'naked', 'desolate', 'wasteland.Okay', 'lem', 'first', 'state', 'movie', 'sports', 'really', 'keen', 'animation', 'not', 'always', 'scope', 'theatrical', 'quality', 'definate', 'improvement', 'TV', 'series', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'redundant', 'bit', 'Utena', 'walking', 'up', 'stairs', 'castle', 'used', 'freakin', 'episode', 'However', 'trying', 'grasp', 'whole', 'concept', 'story', 'harder', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'entire', 'Evangelion', 'series', 'watching', 'backwards', 'dropping', 'acid', 'same', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'how', 'know', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'overlaying', 'themes', 'going', 'would', 'take', 'least', 'multiple', 'screenings', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'understanding', 'how', 'might', 'possibly', 'fit', 'together', 'Utena', 'Anthy', 'relationship', 'amped', 'up', 'being', 'something', 'more', 'hentai', 'dojinshi', 'plot', 'official', 'movie', 'idea', 'world', 'where', 'everything', 'happening', 'land', 'dead', 'done', 'fairly', 'well', 'rest', 'premise', 'really', 'hard', 'wrap', 'head', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'watching', 'entire', 'TV', 'series', 'must', 'looking', 'up', 'movie', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'be', 'really', 'lost']",Revolutionary Girl Utena - The Movie

That's all I'm going to say about it, I don't want to give everything away.It's not a children's movie though.

You might have to have some knowledge of the TV series or you won't know what the heck is going on.Content: AAnimation: A+Music: A-English Version: B+Japanese Version: AFight Scenes: B+First off, lets clear the air. Even though Utena looks like a great film with animation that can one-up Disney, it is not for kids. It contains violence, nudity and lesbian themes. And when I say nudity and lesbian themes, I don't mean little. I mean there is a lot of it. Just a little warning for all you cautious parents out there.Utena is in a new student at a high school in a very imaginative structural city. There, she meets her ex-boyfriend. Utena soon notices the Rose Ring. After aquiring one, Utena ends up in a duel with somebody at a rose garden. She soon learns that the Rose Ring gives the chance for a prince to duel. If the prince wins, he recieves the Rose Bride, Anthy. Utena wins and now she is still wondering what the point of the Rose Bride is. Utena plans to se Anthy free, but Shiori will not stand for this. Shiori, Anthy's new lovers, wants to humiliate the Rose Bride for her own ideals. Soon, it turns into a desperate escape from the city for Utena and Anthy.All the characters look great in this film as they did in the TV series. Chu Chu makes a small appearence in a mini-movie right in the middle of the film. One thing you should bear in mind is that most of the plot is symbolic. If you dont keep this is mind, you won't understand any of the story.Now for the extras. US Manga has spoiled us this time. First we get Audio Commentary by the director. If you didn't understand any of the story, the audio commentary will help you a lot. Next up is a Behind the Scenes feature with the dub cast. It was cool to see the ADR director from the Harlock Saga again. Theres some nice sketch and art video galleries on here as well. Even better, theres a Fan Tribute featuring 10 pictures of art and costumes presented by the fans. Continuing on is the Trivia. These questions are basically Did-You-Notice-That questions that are pretty easy. Then there are some great Trailers and TV Spots from Japan and the US. A pretty large number of extras that was worth putting on the disc.Overall, Utena is one fun ride that should please any mature audiance who can appreciate good art and good story.

664274,A2EQBABN91KOKX,B00005LP42,"""miakarayne""","[4, 5]","This seems like it is going to be one of the biggest anime releases of the year.First off, the Utena Movie is a trip into the mind like anime has never ventured before. Though it is not as completely involved or confusing as Lain, or as down-right depressing as Neon Genesis Evangelion; the Utena Movie takes characters of which we all can connect with in one way or another, and it plops them into the most surreal, almost abstract, setting and from there makes our minds go haywire. Beginning with the floating setting of the Ohtori campus to rings blooming out of roses, once this movie begins it won't slow down. In a sense, this movie is a Picasso painting mixed with fairy tale and mystery. It takes the basic plot of the Utena TV Series, but being a theatrical release, it brings the story to a whole other level. Allowing more by way of the relationship of Anshi and Utena (they even pop in a kiss here and there and have complete nudity as well) + allowing a bit darker story (since TV usually allows a pg-13 rating at best, theatre allows for anything) this is the Utena story your mommas don't want you to see. But if you can I would highly recommend it!I see that this release will be a treat for all of us fans. Noticing all the extras (Character development, interviews, making of section, Fan Tribute, + DVD-Rom extras etc.) that are on the disc (grr, I submitted fan art for the fan tribute section, but it didn't win...), both Dubbed and Subtitled versions, and seeing that the lyrics will be in romanji (yay!), I know that I'll be buying the movie the day it is released (and throwing out my fansub copy ^_^)... The only thing that gets me is that they don't have an option to take it off of Widescreen, but ah well. I like seeing the movie in its full expanse ^_^So, if you're in the mood for a movie that only *slightly* makes sense, with top-notch animation, with characters and a plot that'll blow your mind away this is THE movie for you!

664276,ARQQSJWPP6F38,B00005LP42,starrdragon,"[7, 7]","I was immensley pleased when I heard that the Utena movie was coming out in America, being a very big fan of the original series and manga. At first seeing the movie, I was not dissapointed one little bit.The animation in this movie is supurb. Beautiful, rich, crisp images captivate your eyes throughout the entire movie. The graphic qaulity of this movie is in the same leauge as any Miyazaki movie, which is very good indeed. Even now, several years after the first release the movie visual capasity of this movie is better than most anime movies and series. In no way was the animation flawed at all. I especialy loved the dance scene between Utena and Anshii, which in my view is one of the most graphicly beautiful in all of anime, and certainly the highlight of the movie.The plot of the movie is based losely on the anime and manga series Shojo Kakumei Utena, or Revolutionary Girl Utena in English. The major theme of the plot is the same, Utena getting involved in the duels to keep possesion of the Rose Bride, Himemiya Anshii (in Japanese, last name then first name). And soon Utena and Anshii develope a very close friendship. That is one thing that the series has over the movie, it is that the relationship in the movie is lesbian, unlike in the series when the two are always trying to keep their feelings to themselves. Also unlike in the series which the movie is superior to it, is that Utena is clearly in love with Anshii, and she isn't being torn between either Touga or Anshii. That part of the series really bugged me, and the movie dosen't do that. However one flaw in the plot is that the movie presents Saionji as some insane woman beater. Although he has that outward apperence, it dosen't give his rather sad story like it dose in the show that shows exactly why Saionji is the way he is. Even the part at the end when Utena is morphed into a car for her and Anshii to escape in is wonderfully original and creative.Each of the characters is wonderful and has their own original personality. Utena's personality is kept pretty much the same in the anime and in the movie, which was fine with me. However, Anshii lost her 'gone with the wind' type of attitude that she held in the manga and series. After a while you get used to the personality change, and learn to like her new character. Touga and Shiori's character are kept pretty much the same, in which I can't stand Shiori. Although I don't remember Touga taking much of an interest in Shiori as he dose in the movie. Juri and Miki aren't really mentioned much so there really isn't a whole lot that changed in their character, and for some odd reason Miki still has that blasted stopwatch.Sound wise, the Japanese version was suberb while the English dub had some problems. Okay maybe more than some problems. Alright, the English version had A LOT of problems. While the dubbers kept the music the same, all of the voices made me want to chringe. Utena's voice was okay, there was a lot of room for improvment, but I delt with it. I could of pee'ed my self when I heard Anshii, Saionji, and Touga's English voice. They were AWFUL. The only good thing about the English dubb is that Miki for once, sounds like a guy. I never got why in the original he sounds like a girl. Not neccicarily a good voice that matched his character, but it was a masculine voice anyway.Overall, The Shojo Kakumei Utena movie, or The Adolesence of Utena was a wonderful movie. For any Utena fans out there it is a must see. I would not recomend that you watch this unless you have seen at least all the way through the Black Rose Arc and the Akio Arc in the series Shojo Kakumei Utena. If not you WILL be lost and confused. When I showed this to my friend, who had not seen the show Utena but knew the basic plot information, she was VERY lost in the movie plot. Also, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOUNGER AUDIENCES. PLEASE HEED THE PG-13 RATING. Like I said, this movie is a must see for any Utena fan, weither you like the manga version of anime, The Adolesence of Utena is a wonderful movie, with a lovely images, a creative plot, and awsome characters.",5,Power of the Revolution,1060041600,"08 5, 2003",2003,4113,"['was', 'immensley', 'pleased', 'when', 'heard', 'Utena', 'movie', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'America', 'being', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'series', 'manga', 'first', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'dissapointed', 'one', 'little', 'bit.The', 'animation', 'movie', 'supurb', 'Beautiful', 'rich', 'crisp', 'images', 'captivate', 'eyes', 'entire', 'movie', 'graphic', 'qaulity', 'movie', 'same', 'leauge', 'Miyazaki', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'Even', 'now', 'several', 'years', 'first', 'release', 'movie', 'visual', 'capasity', 'movie', 'better', 'most', 'anime', 'movies', 'series', 'way', 'was', 'animation', 'flawed', 'especialy', 'loved', 'dance', 'scene', 'Utena', 'Anshii', 'view', 'one', 'most', 'graphicly', 'beautiful', 'anime', 'certainly', 'highlight', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'based', 'losely', 'anime', 'manga', 'series', 'Shojo', 'Kakumei', 'Utena', 'Revolutionary', 'Girl', 'Utena', 'English', 'major', 'theme', 'plot', 'same', 'Utena', 'getting', 'involved', 'duels', 'keep', 'possesion', 'Rose', 'Bride', 'Himemiya', 'Anshii', 'Japanese', 'last', 'name', 'then', 'first', 'name', 'soon', 'Utena', 'Anshii', 'develope', 'very', 'close', 'friendship', 'one', 'thing', 'series', 'movie', 'relationship', 'movie', 'lesbian', 'series', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'always', 'trying', 'keep', 'feelings', 'Also', 'series', 'movie', 'superior', 'Utena', 'clearly', 'love', 'Anshii', ""n't"", 'being', 'torn', 'Touga', 'Anshii', 'part', 'series', 'really', 'bugged', 'movie', 'dose', ""n't"", 'do', 'However', 'one', 'flaw', 'plot', 'movie', 'Saionji', 'insane', 'woman', 'beater', 'outward', 'apperence', 'dose', ""n't"", 'give', 'rather', 'sad', 'story', 'dose', 'show', 'exactly', 'why', 'Saionji', 'way', 'Even', 'part', 'end', 'when', 'Utena', 'morphed', 'car', 'Anshii', 'escape', 'wonderfully', 'original', 'creative.Each', 'characters', 'wonderful', 'own', 'original', 'personality', 'Utena', 'personality', 'kept', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'anime', 'movie', 'was', 'fine', 'However', 'Anshii', 'lost', ""'gone"", 'wind', 'type', 'attitude', 'held', 'manga', 'series', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'personality', 'change', 'learn', 'like', 'new', 'character', 'Touga', 'Shiori', 'character', 'are', 'kept', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Shiori', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Touga', 'taking', 'much', 'interest', 'Shiori', 'movie', 'Juri', 'Miki', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'mentioned', 'much', 'really', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'changed', 'character', 'odd', 'reason', 'Miki', 'still', 'blasted', 'stopwatch.Sound', 'wise', 'Japanese', 'version', 'was', 'suberb', 'English', 'dub', 'had', 'problems', 'maybe', 'more', 'problems', 'Alright', 'English', 'version', 'had', 'LOT', 'problems', 'dubbers', 'kept', 'music', 'same', 'voices', 'made', 'want', 'chringe', 'Utena', 'voice', 'was', 'okay', 'was', 'lot', 'room', 'improvment', 'delt', 'could', ""pee'ed"", 'self', 'when', 'heard', 'Anshii', 'Saionji', 'Touga', 'English', 'voice', 'were', 'AWFUL', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'English', 'dubb', 'Miki', 'once', 'guy', 'never', 'got', 'why', 'original', 'girl', 'Not', 'neccicarily', 'good', 'voice', 'matched', 'character', 'was', 'masculine', 'voice', 'anyway.Overall', 'Shojo', 'Kakumei', 'Utena', 'movie', 'Adolesence', 'Utena', 'was', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Utena', 'fans', 'out', 'must', 'see', 'would', 'not', 'recomend', 'watch', 'have', 'seen', 'least', 'way', 'Black', 'Rose', 'Arc', 'Akio', 'Arc', 'series', 'Shojo', 'Kakumei', 'Utena', 'not', 'WILL', 'be', 'lost', 'confused', 'When', 'showed', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'show', 'Utena', 'knew', 'basic', 'plot', 'information', 'was', 'VERY', 'lost', 'movie', 'plot', 'Also', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'NOT', 'FOR', 'YOUNGER', 'AUDIENCES', 'PLEASE', 'HEED', 'THE', 'PG-13', 'RATING', 'said', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'Utena', 'fan', 'weither', 'manga', 'version', 'anime', 'Adolesence', 'Utena', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'lovely', 'images', 'creative', 'plot', 'awsome', 'characters']",Revolutionary Girl Utena - The Movie
664277,A3GSWTW4PGL2XC,B00005LP42,Timothy Perper,"[27, 28]","""Utena - the Movie"" is a masterpiece, brilliant in color and concept, and fascinating in its plot and meanings. Of course, if you want connect-the-dots animation and plotting, or if you think that Utena and Anthy are sweet little teenagers, then you'll hate it, but this film was made for viewers who will want to see it again and again to puzzle out its secrets and mysteries. And ""Utena"" has secrets as well as some of the most gorgeous animation ever done, like the dance sequence and the final car chase. --- The film operates on two distinct, but interpenetrating registers. One is symbolic, and the other surrealist. Utena and Anthy, now older than they were in the television show, have once again met at Ohtori Academy, once again to find each other in a kind of karmic repetition of their past lives. Symbols of the past echo throughout the film as dying monuments. Utena's no-longer-really alive, once-boyfriend/lover Touga emerges from white shrouds to talk on the phone to Anthy's equally dead brother Akio, the unprincipled headmaster of a previous Ohtori Academy that nonetheless still enslaves Anthy. Crimson roses grow on a platform cantilevered high above Ohtori, tended by Anthy, still the Rose Bride to be won by duel. And splashes of blood red crimson stain not only the roses but the walls and walkways of the surreal world of Ohtori. The crimson of the roses is also the crimson of Anthy's blood, but the rose that Utena finds and that Anthy gives to her is white: unstained. It is a symbol of their undying love, loyalty, and interwoven fates. --- The film lacks the virtually Wagnerian high drama of the television show. Instead, it is more modern (as befits the reprise of Utena and Anthy's love story) and sharper edged, not absurdist, but surreal. The architecture of Ohtori Academy looks like a cross between de Chirico and a mecha designer gone mad, but that's Ohtori for you, the world from which Utena and Anthy escape. --- At one level, the film is simply the story of two young women who escape the repressions of adolescence to find themselves and each other. At another, it is an allegory of love, this between two women who will build their own roads together. At yet another, it is a portrayal of sexuality, warped and truly corrupt within Ohtori Academy, and centered and intimate between Utena and Anthy outside Ohtori. Ohtori is the world of consensus reality, and of acceptance of what is given and commanded, in brief, all the things that Utena and Anthy must escape. The Castle of Eternity, previously a hoped-for panacea for instant happiness, is now a polluting illusion, corrupt and lethal. It represents all that Utena and Anthy must destroy if they are to become real people, genuine and authentic. --- That the film succeeds in all this, and much more (the music is marvelous), is a tribute to the skills of director Kunihiko Ikuhara and artist Chiho Saito, the woman who drew the original manga. It is not necessary to know the previous versions, although that adds depth to the film, because ultimately the film stands alone: the story of two young women in love who find their way to freedom.",5,A Mysterious and Gorgeous Masterpiece,1072137600,"12 23, 2003",2003,3144,"['Utena', 'Movie', 'masterpiece', 'brilliant', 'color', 'concept', 'fascinating', 'plot', 'meanings', 'course', 'want', 'connect-the-dots', 'animation', 'plotting', 'think', 'Utena', 'Anthy', 'are', 'sweet', 'little', 'teenagers', 'then', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'viewers', 'who', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'puzzle', 'out', 'secrets', 'mysteries', 'Utena', 'secrets', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'animation', 'ever', 'done', 'dance', 'sequence', 'final', 'car', 'chase', 'film', 'two', 'distinct', 'interpenetrating', 'registers', 'One', 'symbolic', 'other', 'surrealist', 'Utena', 'Anthy', 'now', 'older', 'were', 'television', 'show', 'have', 'once', 'again', 'met', 'Ohtori', 'Academy', 'once', 'again', 'find', 'other', 'kind', 'karmic', 'repetition', 'past', 'lives', 'Symbols', 'past', 'echo', 'film', 'dying', 'monuments', 'Utena', 'no-longer-really', 'alive', 'once-boyfriend/lover', 'Touga', 'emerges', 'white', 'shrouds', 'talk', 'phone', 'Anthy', 'equally', 'dead', 'brother', 'Akio', 'unprincipled', 'headmaster', 'previous', 'Ohtori', 'Academy', 'nonetheless', 'still', 'Anthy', 'Crimson', 'grow', 'platform', 'cantilevered', 'high', 'Ohtori', 'tended', 'Anthy', 'still', 'Rose', 'Bride', 'be', 'won', 'duel', 'splashes', 'blood', 'red', 'crimson', 'stain', 'not', 'only', 'roses', 'walls', 'walkways', 'surreal', 'world', 'Ohtori', 'crimson', 'roses', 'also', 'crimson', 'Anthy', 'blood', 'rose', 'Utena', 'finds', 'Anthy', 'white', 'unstained', 'symbol', 'undying', 'love', 'loyalty', 'interwoven', 'fates', 'film', 'virtually', 'Wagnerian', 'high', 'drama', 'television', 'show', 'Instead', 'more', 'modern', 'reprise', 'Utena', 'Anthy', 'love', 'story', 'sharper', 'edged', 'not', 'absurdist', 'surreal', 'architecture', 'Ohtori', 'Academy', 'cross', 'de', 'Chirico', 'mecha', 'designer', 'gone', 'mad', 'Ohtori', 'world', 'Utena', 'Anthy', 'escape', 'one', 'level', 'film', 'simply', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'escape', 'repressions', 'adolescence', 'find', 'other', 'allegory', 'love', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'will', 'build', 'own', 'roads', 'together', 'yet', 'portrayal', 'sexuality', 'warped', 'truly', 'corrupt', 'Ohtori', 'Academy', 'centered', 'intimate', 'Utena', 'Anthy', 'Ohtori', 'Ohtori', 'world', 'consensus', 'reality', 'acceptance', 'what', 'given', 'commanded', 'brief', 'things', 'Utena', 'Anthy', 'must', 'escape', 'Castle', 'Eternity', 'previously', 'hoped-for', 'panacea', 'instant', 'happiness', 'now', 'polluting', 'illusion', 'corrupt', 'lethal', 'Utena', 'Anthy', 'must', 'destroy', 'are', 'become', 'real', 'people', 'genuine', 'authentic', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'music', 'marvelous', 'tribute', 'skills', 'director', 'Kunihiko', 'Ikuhara', 'artist', 'Chiho', 'Saito', 'woman', 'who', 'drew', 'original', 'manga', 'not', 'necessary', 'know', 'previous', 'versions', 'depth', 'film', 'ultimately', 'film', 'alone', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'love', 'who', 'find', 'way', 'freedom']",Revolutionary Girl Utena - The Movie

There is a lot of symbolism in the movie that you can miss if you don't pay attention. Okay, even if you do you could still miss the point, whatever that may be. I do love how they draw their characters in Utena, and the animation is very well done.
