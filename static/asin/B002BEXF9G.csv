I bought the Zombies' Zombie Heaven box set back in the spring of this past writing, and have become involved in most anything by the group or its individual members since.What a shame that they had such a hard go at it in the 60s, because Odessey and Oracle was and still remains one of the most magical and underrated albums of its time.  What a pleasure to see that, 4 decades on, these incredible musicians haven't lost their touch. This live performance is full of magic and intimacy, plus they also perform various songs from early Zombies years, some from Colin Blunstone's solo albums, and some from Rod Argent's self titled group.  Excellent performances that make you feel like you're right there, and a great bonus interview feature on the making of an incredibly underrated album.  Great for long-time fans and newcomers alike, this is one classic rock DVD you have to add to your collection.",5,A Band that Hasn't Lost Their Edge.,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,986,"['Want', 'be', 'impressed', '60s', 'veteran', 'rockers', 'Here', 'exactly', 'where', 'come', 'bought', 'Zombies', 'Zombie', 'Heaven', 'box', 'set', 'back', 'spring', 'past', 'writing', 'have', 'become', 'involved', 'most', 'anything', 'group', 'individual', 'members', 'since.What', 'shame', 'had', 'hard', 'go', '60s', 'Odessey', 'Oracle', 'was', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'magical', 'underrated', 'albums', 'time', 'What', 'pleasure', 'see', '4', 'decades', 'incredible', 'musicians', 'have', ""n't"", 'lost', 'touch', 'live', 'performance', 'full', 'magic', 'intimacy', 'also', 'perform', 'various', 'songs', 'early', 'Zombies', 'years', 'Colin', 'Blunstone', 'solo', 'albums', 'Rod', 'Argent', 'self', 'titled', 'group', 'Excellent', 'performances', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'right', 'there', 'great', 'bonus', 'interview', 'feature', 'making', 'incredibly', 'underrated', 'album', 'Great', 'long-time', 'fans', 'newcomers', 'alike', 'one', 'classic', 'rock', 'DVD', 'have', 'add', 'collection']","The Zombies, Odessey & Oracle"

Seeing Chris White, who wrote more than half of this album, and drummer Hugh Grundy perform with former band mates Colin Blunstone and Rod Argent was just an intense joy.  And this DVD, as well as the CD, captures the entire concert beautifully, both the Odessey & Oracle part of the show and the other half that featured some of the great Zombie, Argent and Colin Blunstone tunes.

1259496,AYXC0BI77LVIT,B002BEXF9G,Philipgstekel,"[5, 5]","I stumbled across this DVD quite by accident and I must say that this is an incredible DVD.  Kudos to the rest of the reviewers here for they have put into words the exact same thoughts I would convey.However, for those who think this will surpass the original album; I would beg to differ.  If you are an absolute purist, you will hear the faults but this is forgivable since this is 40 years transfixed and a studio recording can do take after take and create layer upon layer until total perfection is reached.If you are the type of person who likes the live performance with it's natural spontaneous energy and the flaws only add to a one of a kind event, then this is the best DVD you will ever hear of The Zombies.The performances are true to the original recording; lovingly put together and performed and Colin Blunstone's voice is still a beautiful and delicate instrument.  He has been far and away, my all time favorite singer.  On record, his natural breathy and wispy voice comes through better than in live performance.  This can only be because it doesn't translate as well in live performance.  It does however; come through enough so that you won't be disappointed if this is what you like most about him.As a singer overall, in a live performance, he shows much more range than in recordings and not to leave out the band, for a bunch of 60 something rockers, they still bring the goods.  Rod Argent can hold his own with any of the keyboard players of today.The album 40 years later still holds up extremely well in live performance.  It is one of my top 5 all time favorites and although I may be a little bias, you won't be disappointed in the purchase of this DVD!!!!!",5,Totally in Zombieland after hearing and seeing this DVD,1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,1690,"['stumbled', 'DVD', 'quite', 'accident', 'must', 'say', 'incredible', 'DVD', 'Kudos', 'rest', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'put', 'words', 'exact', 'same', 'thoughts', 'would', 'convey.However', 'who', 'think', 'will', 'surpass', 'original', 'album', 'would', 'beg', 'differ', 'are', 'absolute', 'purist', 'will', 'hear', 'faults', 'forgivable', '40', 'years', 'transfixed', 'studio', 'recording', 'can', 'do', 'take', 'take', 'create', 'layer', 'layer', 'total', 'perfection', 'reached.If', 'are', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'live', 'performance', 'natural', 'spontaneous', 'energy', 'flaws', 'only', 'add', 'one', 'kind', 'event', 'then', 'best', 'DVD', 'will', 'ever', 'hear', 'Zombies.The', 'performances', 'are', 'true', 'original', 'recording', 'lovingly', 'put', 'together', 'performed', 'Colin', 'Blunstone', 'voice', 'still', 'beautiful', 'delicate', 'instrument', 'been', 'far', 'away', 'time', 'favorite', 'singer', 'record', 'natural', 'breathy', 'wispy', 'voice', 'better', 'live', 'performance', 'can', 'only', 'be', ""n't"", 'translate', 'as', 'well', 'live', 'performance', 'however', 'come', 'enough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'what', 'like', 'most', 'him.As', 'singer', 'overall', 'live', 'performance', 'much', 'more', 'range', 'recordings', 'not', 'leave', 'out', 'band', 'bunch', '60', 'something', 'rockers', 'still', 'bring', 'goods', 'Rod', 'Argent', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'keyboard', 'players', 'today.The', 'album', '40', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', 'live', 'performance', 'one', 'top', '5', 'time', 'favorites', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'bias', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'purchase', 'DVD']","The Zombies, Odessey & Oracle"

Colin Blunstone, probably best known for ""Time of The Season"" by the Zombies sings flawlessly and the collection of songs is the best! It's amazing that after all these years these guys still have it! I'm a big fan of Colin Blunstone as his vocals are so unique and can also be heard on many Alan Parsons Project albums. It's a total joy to watch Colin and Rod Argent breathe new life into these classic songs from their past including a fantastic live version of Rod's ""Hold Your Head Up""!!! This DVD is a great buy!

1259498,A1VY2CG81I1JRR,B002BEXF9G,SingingDesigner,"[0, 0]","Part 2: the performance of the reunited four (plus) was blissfully entertaining for me.  Hearing the live O&O; plus their two biggest hits was a absolute joy, and as others have stated, their chops are tops. (5/5 stars)Part 1: again, terrific performance, great music (really liked Colin's string-accompanied performance) but the material covered simply doesn't hold up to the high bar of part 2. (4/5 stars)Bonus material: While I appreciate that they included anything at all, I REALLY wish that there wasn't only portions of a documentary, but rather the whole thing.  A full length documentary on the band would have made a fantastic bonus addition.  That said, I would NOT count that against my review of the DVD overall, since I really purchased the concert, not the documentary.  I mention it, that's all.The real complaint is one that's very similar to that of ""imploder"", who gave the DVD 3 stars: the video's direction is annoying and misleading.  There's no shortage of camera angles, and it seemed that the director used them all to the point that you couldn't simply watch Colin sing, but that you had to see him through cycling camera shots every 3 seconds or so, then through multiple angles at once on a ""split screen"".  I can understand the theory behind this.  Split screens in cases where you want to see Rod's face and his hands play the keys, or Rod, Colin and Chris in a split screen close up, was great; however, there were a number of unnecessary editing decisions that brought down the viewing experience slightly.Also worth mentioning that it's stated on the DVD packaging that this is one night, a single performance, March 8, from a three-night engagement (3/7-3/9/2008) but it becomes apparent that other performances were edited in, which is also distracting.  Some brief shots show the band slightly out of sync with the performance, and band members changing their position/expression from edit to edit.  So independent of the band performance and/or music, the video production is somewhat disappointing.  (2.5/5 stars)Video production notwithstanding, this is far from a deal breaker!
