That and the fact that the title is Eminem: Live From New York City not whatever the name of the concert was.As for the actual concert, I thought it was pretty good. Eminem seems to have fallen of the grid since his best friend deceased. If I was him I think that I would have done the same since hitting the stage without him when he was by you everytime you went on- now thats just deep if you think about it. Now I'm just getting off topic. But in the concert- it was interesting to see him and Proof togethor at every set. The choice of music itself, it comprised of more of the newer stuff (which is old by now) and I'm not big on his last item but it was ok. As for his old songs-loved them- though, once more its sad to say, the raw energy that Eminem showed once upon a time is gone. I always wondered if he was like an Elvis Presley, if he used some sort of substance. It always apeared to me like he was on a little bit of something (most of the time, alot at others.) Yet, even though this concert did not have that energy Eminem will still go down as one talented M---er F-er and a rap icon and still deserves a bow.Bravo!",4,Not bad!,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,1261,"['First', 'missing', 'artists', 'are', 'probably', 'due', 'licensing', 'agreements', 'Therefore', 'probably', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'fact', 'title', 'Eminem', 'Live', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'not', 'name', 'concert', 'was.As', 'actual', 'concert', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Eminem', 'have', 'fallen', 'grid', 'best', 'friend', 'deceased', 'was', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'hitting', 'stage', 'when', 'was', 'everytime', 'went', 'on-', 'now', 'just', 'deep', 'think', 'Now', ""'m"", 'just', 'getting', 'off', 'topic', 'concert-', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'Proof', 'togethor', 'set', 'choice', 'music', 'comprised', 'more', 'newer', 'stuff', 'old', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'last', 'item', 'was', 'ok.', 'old', 'songs-loved', 'them-', 'once', 'more', 'sad', 'say', 'raw', 'energy', 'Eminem', 'showed', 'once', 'time', 'gone', 'always', 'wondered', 'was', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'used', 'sort', 'substance', 'always', 'apeared', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'something', 'most', 'time', 'alot', 'others', 'even', 'concert', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'energy', 'Eminem', 'will', 'still', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'talented', 'M', '-er', 'F-er', 'rap', 'icon', 'still', 'bow.Bravo']",N/A
