The 1988-89 television season began late due to a writers' strike just like it delayed the 1981-82 season for many shows. With The Cosby Show still #1 in the Nielsen ratings,Werner and Carsey ended up with another immediate hit(TCS was just that when it premiered on NBC in 1984). There's nothing like a stand-up comic with a sitcom of his/her own. Roseanne Barr is Roseanne Conner,a Lanford,Illinois woman whose husband Dan(John Goodman) owns and operates Lanford Cycles,which he would shut down later in the series. Roseanne's sister Jackie Harris(Laurie Metcalf) is an aspiring law enforcement officer(she'd join the police force later in the series). The Conners' children are Becky(Lecy Goranson),Darlene(Sara Gilbert,Melissa's sister) and Dan Jr. aka D.J.(Michael Fishman). Becky is age 15 or 16,Darlene is 12 or 13 and D.J. is 6 or 7. Another actor played D.J. in the pilot episode(I don't remember his name). At one point in the series,Goranson left and Sarah Chalke resumed Goranson's character. Then Chalke would leave and Goranson would return. In the opening montage,the Conners and Jackie are at the dinner table about to dig into Chinese food. At the end,we hear Roseanne maniacally laughing(in future openings there'd be a new versions of the theme song,and of course,a new version of Roseanne's laughing).",5,Roseanne Barr makes a name for herself!,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,1464,"['Cosby', 'Show', 'producers', 'Tom', 'Werner', 'Marcy', 'Carsey', 'took', 'second', 'responsibility', '1988', 'ABC', 'sitcom', 'premiering', 'October', '18', 'year', '1988-89', 'television', 'season', 'began', 'late', 'due', 'writers', 'strike', 'just', 'delayed', '1981-82', 'season', 'many', 'shows', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'still', '1', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'Werner', 'Carsey', 'ended', 'up', 'immediate', 'hit', 'TCS', 'was', 'just', 'when', 'premiered', 'NBC', '1984', 'nothing', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'sitcom', 'own', 'Roseanne', 'Barr', 'Roseanne', 'Conner', 'Lanford', 'Illinois', 'woman', 'husband', 'Dan', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Lanford', 'Cycles', 'would', 'shut', 'down', 'later', 'series', 'Roseanne', 'sister', 'Jackie', 'Harris', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'aspiring', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', ""'d"", 'join', 'police', 'force', 'later', 'series', 'Conners', 'children', 'are', 'Becky', 'Lecy', 'Goranson', 'Darlene', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'Melissa', 'sister', 'Dan', 'Jr.', 'aka', 'D.J', 'Michael', 'Fishman', 'Becky', 'age', '15', '16', 'Darlene', '12', '13', 'D.J', '6', '7', 'actor', 'played', 'D.J', 'pilot', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'one', 'point', 'series', 'Goranson', 'left', 'Sarah', 'Chalke', 'resumed', 'Goranson', 'character', 'Then', 'Chalke', 'would', 'leave', 'Goranson', 'would', 'return', 'opening', 'montage', 'Conners', 'Jackie', 'are', 'dinner', 'table', 'dig', 'Chinese', 'food', 'end', 'hear', 'Roseanne', 'maniacally', 'laughing', 'future', 'openings', ""'d"", 'be', 'new', 'versions', 'theme', 'song', 'course', 'new', 'version', 'Roseanne', 'laughing']",Roseanne: Season 1

It's one of the few shows I never EVER get tired of.  Dating back to 1987 when it first aired, right through syndication, I still watch it constantly.That being said, I was literally ecstatic when I heard this great show was coming to DVD.  I swore, I'd be amongst the first to purchase it upon release.This was until I found out that this set has suffered the same fate as other TV/DVD releases (most notably 'ALF').  Carsey-Werner has taken it upon themselves to give us SYNDICATED EPISODES.  In other words, a number of minutes have been shaved off of EACH and EVERY episode contained within this set.Now we're not talking about useless footage.  This is a sitcom, and as such, every minute is intricate to each storyline.  We're not losing scenes such as Darlene being lost in thought, or Dan making his way from the living room to the bedroom.  Sitcoms are fast-paced, and as many will tell you, each minute DOES count.So, to the naysayers who claim that this shouldn't be an issue, let me ask you this?  Would you purchase a book missing 1/10 of the pages?  Would you accept a paycheck missing 1/10 of your earnings?  If your answer is NO, then why on earth should we accept this box set when each episode is missing 1/10 of the footage?For those who love this show, I emplor you.  Don't succumb to this mediocre product.  By purchasing this, you're telling these companies that it's ok to release products containing missing footage.  And by doing that, they'll be under the impression that it's ok to do it with future seasons.......and ultimately, future shows.  I for one don't want to see that happen.

While the first season is far from my favorite (due to several episodes that seem to fit the style of cheesy shows like ""The Cosby Show"" or ""Full House"") it does have a number of excellent episodes, including ""A Bride Over Troubled Sonny,"" ""A Nightmare On Oak Street,"" ""Workin' Overtime,"" ""Dear Mom And Dad,"" and especially the season finale, ""Let's Call It Quits.""  For years, I anxiously awaited the day when this brilliant show would be made available on DVD, uncut and commercial free, to be enjoyed for years and years to come without the hassle of grainy, syndicated reruns polluted by ridiculous editing and long commercial breaks.Around November 2004, the news came that my favorite show would be on DVD, and soon!  I was so excited, I literally jumped up and danced for several minutes, and I didn't care how ridiculous I looked.  A few short months later, I read the official release date of the COMPLETE first season:  August 30th, 2005.  I ran upstairs to my calendar and marked the date in big black letters.August came, and it was pretty late in August when I happened to read the official Amazon.com review of the series.  The review went into good detail about just what made ""Roseanne"" such an amazing show, and I could barely contain my glee at the idea of owning it!  Then, I reached the end of the review, where it was noted that the episodes in the DVD set were the syndicated versions, edited by 2-3 minutes.My heart sank.  I couldn't believe it.  How could they do this to me?  How could they do this to the millions of ""Roseanne"" fans around the world?  It was ridiculous and unfair and I couldn't understand the logic.  One thing was for sure, though.  I would not be buying this set if my life depended on it.  Edited episodes are unacceptable for ANY show, but the notion of putting inferior episodes of ""Roseanne"" out on DVD is a million times worse.So, that's why you see a one star rating above this review.  You can watch the syndicated versions of this classic sitcom at least four times a day, on various stations.  Why pay good money for the same thing?There is good news, though.  I wasn't the only person angry about the butchery of this set, and the other fans joined me in being very vocal to the company about our displeasure, and because of this (and the low sales of the first season, as well as the amazingly large number of preorders that were cancelled), the second season was released December 6th completely uncut, and the same treatment will be given to seasons three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine.You may notice some reviews were people say, ""Get a life!  Who cares if the episodes are edited?""

630642,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B00005JNF7,calvinnme,"[3, 3]","My five star rating refers to season one of ""Roseanne"", not the cut version of the episodes offered on this DVD. I agree with the outrage everyone else has expressed over this treatment the series received in this regard.I would say that this first season of Roseanne was a 5 star season, that seasons 2-4 were six star seasons, and that seasons 5 and 6 went back to mere 5-star quality. In the first half of the season you can really tell that the characters are struggling somewhat to figure out exactly who they should be. Even Roseanne herself seems to be struggling to translate her stand-up comedy routine into a half-hour show that involves character interaction.To me, the first show that really had the characters clicking on a macro level was ""Lover's Lane"" in which the Conner family along with Booker, Crystal and Jackie, decide to spend an evening bowling. Becky gets all dressed up to impress a boy she likes that works at the bowling alley, but is afraid that Roseanne is going to say something to embarrass her. Roseanne does keep Becky guessing all night long, but ultimately, she doesn't do or say anything to hurt her daughter's chances with the young man. Jackie and Booker make a bet on the game: if Booker wins, Jackie  spends the night with him, and if Jackie wins Booker cleans her apartment. It really is a series classic even though nothing special really happens. The magic is in all of the little moments between characters, not in the event - in this case bowling - that has brought them together.""Nightmare on Oak Street"" is another great episode in which Darlene goes into puberty. Dan's reaction to the news is classic - he punches Darlene in the arm and says ""way to go."" Darlene is upset about the whole thing because she figures she will be expected to leave her tomboy stage. Roseanne has a talk with her and explains to her that being ultra-feminine is Becky's version of womanhood and that Darlene will find her own unique way of expressing herself that may be nothing like her sister's. This is groundbreaking stuff for almost twenty years ago.One of the more puzzling episodes in retrospect is ""Dear Mom and Dad"", where Roseanne's parents visit. This is the only episode in which Roseanne's father appears, and he comes across as an annoying yet harmless man. In later seasons he is described by both Jackie and Roseanne as having been an abusive father, which seems wildly out of character considering his demeanor during his sole appearance on the show. Particularly funny is the very end of this episode in which Bruce Willis makes a surprise visit to the set, jumping into bed with Roseanne, planting a kiss on her, and telling her that he figured he'd visit since he ""no longer has anything to do on Tuesday nights"". Younger viewers probably won't realize he was referring to his show ""Moonlighting"" that had been recently cancelled (1989), and that he and John Goodman were the best of friends in real life.The series finale has some real surprises in it that sets up taking the show in a completely different direction in season two, and as a result this is the first and last season for a few recurring characters that were not regular members of the cast.I highly recommend the first season, but not this particular DVD set. Maybe someday it will be re-released with the missing footage restored.",5,Good first season of a groundbreaking show,1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,3345,"['five', 'star', 'rating', 'refers', 'season', 'one', 'Roseanne', 'not', 'cut', 'version', 'episodes', 'offered', 'DVD', 'agree', 'outrage', 'everyone', 'else', 'expressed', 'treatment', 'series', 'received', 'regard.I', 'would', 'say', 'first', 'season', 'Roseanne', 'was', '5', 'star', 'season', 'seasons', '2-4', 'were', 'six', 'star', 'seasons', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'went', 'back', 'mere', '5-star', 'quality', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'characters', 'are', 'struggling', 'somewhat', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'Even', 'Roseanne', 'be', 'struggling', 'translate', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'routine', 'half-hour', 'show', 'character', 'interaction.To', 'first', 'show', 'really', 'had', 'characters', 'clicking', 'macro', 'level', 'was', 'Lover', 'Lane', 'Conner', 'family', 'Booker', 'Crystal', 'Jackie', 'decide', 'spend', 'evening', 'bowling', 'Becky', 'dressed', 'up', 'impress', 'boy', 'bowling', 'alley', 'afraid', 'Roseanne', 'going', 'say', 'something', 'embarrass', 'Roseanne', 'keep', 'Becky', 'guessing', 'night', 'long', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'do', 'say', 'anything', 'hurt', 'daughter', 'chances', 'young', 'man', 'Jackie', 'Booker', 'make', 'bet', 'game', 'Booker', 'Jackie', 'night', 'Jackie', 'Booker', 'apartment', 'really', 'series', 'classic', 'even', 'nothing', 'special', 'really', 'magic', 'little', 'moments', 'characters', 'not', 'event', 'case', 'bowling', 'brought', 'together', 'Nightmare', 'Oak', 'Street', 'great', 'episode', 'Darlene', 'puberty', 'Dan', 'reaction', 'news', 'classic', 'Darlene', 'arm', 'way', 'go', 'Darlene', 'upset', 'whole', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'expected', 'leave', 'tomboy', 'stage', 'Roseanne', 'talk', 'being', 'ultra-feminine', 'Becky', 'version', 'womanhood', 'Darlene', 'will', 'find', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'expressing', 'may', 'be', 'nothing', 'sister', 'groundbreaking', 'stuff', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago.One', 'more', 'puzzling', 'episodes', 'retrospect', 'Dear', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'where', 'Roseanne', 'parents', 'visit', 'only', 'episode', 'Roseanne', 'father', 'across', 'annoying', 'yet', 'harmless', 'man', 'later', 'seasons', 'described', 'Jackie', 'Roseanne', 'having', 'been', 'abusive', 'father', 'wildly', 'character', 'considering', 'demeanor', 'sole', 'appearance', 'show', 'Particularly', 'funny', 'very', 'end', 'episode', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'surprise', 'visit', 'set', 'jumping', 'bed', 'Roseanne', 'planting', 'kiss', 'telling', 'figured', ""'d"", 'visit', 'no', 'longer', 'anything', 'do', 'Tuesday', 'nights', 'Younger', 'viewers', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'referring', 'show', 'Moonlighting', 'had', 'been', 'recently', 'cancelled', '1989', 'John', 'Goodman', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'real', 'life.The', 'series', 'finale', 'real', 'surprises', 'up', 'taking', 'show', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'season', 'two', 'result', 'first', 'last', 'season', 'few', 'recurring', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'regular', 'members', 'cast.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'particular', 'DVD', 'set', 'Maybe', 'someday', 'will', 'be', 're-released', 'missing', 'footage', 'restored']",Roseanne: Season 1

None of the episodes were edited, far as I can tell, so why's everyone complaining?!!  Anchor Bay also released the series Titus on DVD, and it was completely unedited. What makes everyone think that these episodes for Roseanne are?  Looks to me like everyone's making a giant assumption, and you know what happens when you assume. You make an a$$ of U and ME.The episodes themselves are as funny as I remember, with guest appearances by a freakishly young George Clooney, Ned Beatty (Homicide: Life on the Street) as Dan's father, and former Tennessee Senator Fred Dalton Thompson, now playing District Attorney Arthur Branch on ""Law and Order"".The performances from Roseanne and John Goodman are so plain-spoken you can almost see your own parents talking this way, when they're in a good mood. The kids are so young here that they're kinda hard to recognize.  Take a look at the pilot episode, and you'll see it's a different kid playing D.J.  Why he was recast, I don't know.  Rounding out the cast was Laurie Metcalf as Roseanne's sister Jackie.  After nine years on the show, I wasn't sure Laurie would be able to break out of Jackie, but then she appeared in ""Scream 2"" and proved me wrong!I'm pleased to add this DVD set to my collection, and don't intend to miss any of them!

It's one of the most realistic, honest, funniest, yet touching shows ever to grace the small screen.  Roseanne is loveable with her funny little one-liners; Dan's a realistic husband; Jackie's the loving, loyal, often bumbling, yet loveable kind sister and aunt.  Roseanne, John Goodman as Dan and Laurie Metcalf as Jackie really carried the show thru all nine seasons.  The part in the ninth season of Dan straying from the marriage was a bit out of character since all throughout the series Roseanne and Dan have a strong, stable marriage.Although the show is hilarious and witty, there are nice poignant moments added here and there...I think the one episode I will never forget is when poor Jackie is beaten by Fisher and with Roseanne's help breaks up with that creep.  I loved how Roseanne really told Fisher off!  I also won't forget the touching and rather teary episode where Roseanne sees Jackie off to the police academy and they both cry together before Jackie leaves.I like the bond that Jackie and Roseanne share throughout the series and how they stick by each other thru thick and thin.  Roseanne stands by Jackie thru her boyfriend troubles and when Jackie has trouble standing up to her parents while Jackie stands by Roseanne whenever Roseanne or Dan or both of them are unemployed and whenever the kids get to be a handful.  Jackie is also a very loving aunt, the aunt every kid should have.I do wish that Darlene and Becky hadn't gotten married so soon; I'm glad that later Becky does go back to school since she is very intelligent; I suspect she and Mark aren't exactly compatable.  They actually did a good job with the Becky actress replacement; Sarah Chalke does look very much like Lecy Goranson (who had to leave for college).  Very few shows manage to pull it off so well.I'm sooo glad Laurie won those three Emmys; way to go, Laurie!

(Michael Fishman). No timeframe has been given for the release, but Anchor Bay promises that this will be ""will be packed with bonus materials"".How packed? Well, about a year ago tvshowsondvd.com ran a story about just how much Roseanne herself wanted this show to come to DVD, very badly, and that she was willing to participate heavily in extras and dish out all the behind-the-scenes dirt. Is Anchor Bay going to hold her to it? We hope so!Ted Green, CEO of Anchor Bay Entertainment, was quoted in a press release as saying ""Our company will give these DVD releases the attention and care they...deserve. We are happy to be working with the amazing team at Carsey Werner Distribution and thrilled to add these outstanding titles to our stable of top television properties."" Carsey Werner returned the compliment, saying """"'Roseanne' and '3RD Rock From The Sun' are two of our most cherished programs,"" said Robert Dubelko, Co-President/COO of Carsey-Werner., ""When it came time to find a DVD distributor, we wanted an experienced company with the creative energy and enthusiasm to market these series the way we would do it ourselves. Anchor Bay Entertainment fit that need all the way."" Here's more from the press release, about the show itself:Roseanne debuted in 1988 and is one of the most successful and beloved series of all time, remaining on network television for nine years. The multiple award-winning series starred comedian Roseanne as Roseanne Conner, John Goodman (""The Babe,"" ""The Big Lebowski"") as her husband Dan and Laurie Metcalf as her sister Jackie. Each week focused on the struggles of a working class family facing everyday problems: money, children, marriage and of course, in-laws. Roseanne was nominated four times for an Emmy Award and five times for a Golden Globe. She won both awards in 1993. The series had a total of twenty-five Emmy nominations and four wins as well as three Golden Globes, four American Comedy Awards and a Peabody.There's lots more info to come, so stay tuned and we'll let you know more just as soon as we can!",5,COMING TO DVD IN LATE 05'!,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,2418,"['Anchor', 'Bay', 'teamed', 'up', 'Carsey', 'Werner', 'bring', 'Roseanne', 'Domestic', 'Goddess', 'DVD', 'later', 'year', 'husband', 'Dan', 'John', 'Goodman', 'sister', 'Jackie', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'daughter', 'Becky', 'originally', 'played', 'Lecy', 'Goranson', 'while', 'Scrubs', 'Sarah', 'Chalke', 'daughter', 'Darlene', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'currently', 'appearing', 'ER', 'D.J', 'Michael', 'Fishman', 'timeframe', 'been', 'given', 'release', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'will', 'be', 'will', 'be', 'packed', 'bonus', 'materials', '.How', 'packed', 'Well', 'year', 'ago', 'tvshowsondvd.com', 'ran', 'story', 'about', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Roseanne', 'wanted', 'show', 'come', 'DVD', 'very', 'badly', 'was', 'willing', 'participate', 'heavily', 'extras', 'dish', 'out', 'behind-the-scenes', 'dirt', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'going', 'hold', 'hope', 'so', 'Ted', 'Green', 'CEO', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'was', 'quoted', 'press', 'release', 'saying', 'company', 'will', 'give', 'DVD', 'attention', 'care', 'deserve', 'are', 'happy', 'be', 'working', 'amazing', 'team', 'Carsey', 'Werner', 'Distribution', 'thrilled', 'add', 'outstanding', 'titles', 'stable', 'top', 'television', 'properties', 'Carsey', 'Werner', 'returned', 'compliment', 'saying', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'cherished', 'programs', 'said', 'Robert', 'Dubelko', 'Co-President/COO', 'Carsey-Werner.', 'When', 'came', 'time', 'find', 'DVD', 'distributor', 'wanted', 'experienced', 'company', 'creative', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'market', 'series', 'way', 'would', 'do', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'fit', 'need', 'way', 'Here', 'more', 'press', 'release', 'show', 'Roseanne', 'debuted', '1988', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'beloved', 'series', 'time', 'remaining', 'network', 'television', 'nine', 'years', 'multiple', 'award-winning', 'series', 'starred', 'comedian', 'Roseanne', 'Roseanne', 'Conner', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Babe', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'husband', 'Dan', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'sister', 'Jackie', 'week', 'focused', 'struggles', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'facing', 'everyday', 'problems', 'money', 'children', 'marriage', 'course', 'in-laws', 'Roseanne', 'was', 'nominated', 'four', 'times', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'five', 'times', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'won', 'awards', '1993', 'series', 'had', 'total', 'twenty-five', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'four', 'wins', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'four', 'American', 'Comedy', 'Awards', 'Peabody.There', 'lots', 'more', 'info', 'come', 'stay', 'tuned', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'more', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'can']",Roseanne: Season 1

Example- LOOK AT THE I LOVE LUCY DVD'S WHERE PARAMOUNT ACTUALLY REINSERTED LOST FOOTAGE AFTER IT WAS CUT...SO YES THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE.  Technically this is NOT the COMPLETE FIRST SEASON- Rather then false advertising it should be noted as the First Season. The packaging should also reflect these are SYNDICATED versions.

I am really pissed about this....There will be fans who buy this set- and others to follow- but what happens say in a year- if they re-release the UNCUT versions! Is it all a money thing?

When ""Roseanne"" went off the air, its fans felt they'd lost a family member. Relive the memories, and share them with a new generation.

I found out unexpectedly that it's on sale with a price so low I decided to order it.  This set arrived within days, all ready to play.  I enjoyed the episodes, all under 22 minutes each, especially one I don't ever remember seeing before: 'Father's Day' (ep. 14 on disc 2).It's true that all episodes here are edited similar to what's been shown in syndication.  There's a scene I remember in the one with Darlene finding her newspaper job more than she can handle that was omitted ('The Monday Thru Friday Show', ep. 12 on disc 2): if I remember right, after the commercial fadeout midway through, Darlene reports to her boss for not delivering all the newspapers.  The boss goes into lecture mode, but before he's finished Darlene interrupts him and asks him point-blank if she's fired.  The boss says yes... Anyway, I don't remember everything from this season as I wasn't into back then.  Nonetheless, I got to see everything and enjoyed it.Box art dressed in McDonald's colors look nice.  I like the trivia questions listed inside the cases.  Ditto for the extras included.  Not just that but the extras as well as the commentaries are closed-captioned (no subtitles).  Most other shows on DVD can't claim this fact.  Thank you, Roseanne and everyone responsible for putting it together.Would I recommend this product?  Yes, but considering the edited content you might want to wait until it's on sale or when it's re-released in uncut form.  Don't know about the latter, but at least it's an idea.

After watching it etc I noticed seems they are the cut shorter syndicated episodes. It includes the newer opening title sequences stating Roseanne Arnold and NOT Barr which it was at the time and the last closing title card even indicates Carsey Werner - 1997 - copyright for syndication. This is really tremendous disappointment and I have watched the first two episodes and I don't feel like watching any more of them at all. I think that it is very unfair that a show that had really great ratings and a strong following up until the last few years got such vulgar treatment. I realize it may not be fully in Anchor Bay Entertainments hands and may be in the production companies hands but I have been doing a lot of online searching w/ Roseanne fans and they all seem to be really angry and have said they are NOT buying the DVD set. I was wondering why the set seemed to be cased in such a typical fashion as opposed to your release for Third Rock on the Sun which I thought was more lavish.The sells are gonna not be so great on August 30th for this release and could in fact hurt as more Seasons are being released. Sales will falter and go downhill I think everyone needs to ask themselves how hard REALLY HOW HARD would it have been to get the original prints for these episodes? Was it too hard to warrant actual financial losses from poor sales?Who ever made these decisions I would again say not so much Anchor Bay Entertainment but the daft heads at Carsey Werner should in fact lose their jobs for these errors not only on Roseanne but also for the Cosby Show. Some may think this is a bit much but it is selling an incomplete product especially when the box art reads the ""COMPLETE"" first season this is in fact a LIE and is FALSE Advertising. It is taking money from others from a job done poorly. I think the transfers on the episides looked fine but as I watched Only Two episodes I was more angry of what I was missing than trying to really wnjoy the show. I didn't want to watch anymore after that.I think everyone involved in this release would and if NOT should agree for the sake of their revenue make some changes to get the sales for this release back up. It hasn't been released as of this date and already I am hearing so much poor feedback and the fans those who made the show popular and really deserve more for their time are sadly let down.If anyone has any questions about the set since I have it in my possession please ask. - JackDVD78@aol.com",1,Roseanne released thru Anchor Bay Entertainment - Carsey/Werner to Blame for this POORLY released set.,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,2738,"['1', 'Star', 'POOR', 'release', 'were', 'done', 'correctly', 'would', 'have', 'rated', '5', 'Stars.I', 'found', 'Season', 'One', 'Set', 'Roseanne', 'local', 'Used', 'CD/DVD', 'shop', 'guess', 'was', 'preview', 'set', 'anyhow', 'mint', 'condition', 'have', 'been', 'dying', 'see', 'show', 'DVD', 'forever', 'watching', 'etc', 'noticed', 'are', 'cut', 'shorter', 'syndicated', 'episodes', 'newer', 'opening', 'title', 'sequences', 'stating', 'Roseanne', 'Arnold', 'NOT', 'Barr', 'was', 'time', 'last', 'closing', 'title', 'card', 'even', 'Carsey', 'Werner', '1997', 'copyright', 'syndication', 'really', 'tremendous', 'disappointment', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'watching', 'more', 'think', 'very', 'unfair', 'show', 'had', 'really', 'great', 'ratings', 'strong', 'following', 'up', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'got', 'such', 'vulgar', 'treatment', 'realize', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fully', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainments', 'hands', 'may', 'be', 'production', 'companies', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'lot', 'online', 'searching', 'w/', 'Roseanne', 'fans', 'seem', 'be', 'really', 'angry', 'have', 'said', 'are', 'NOT', 'buying', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'set', 'seemed', 'be', 'cased', 'such', 'typical', 'fashion', 'opposed', 'release', 'Third', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'lavish.The', 'are', 'gon', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'great', 'August', '30th', 'release', 'could', 'fact', 'hurt', 'more', 'Seasons', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'Sales', 'will', 'falter', 'go', 'downhill', 'think', 'everyone', 'needs', 'ask', 'how', 'hard', 'REALLY', 'HOW', 'HARD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'get', 'original', 'prints', 'episodes', 'Was', 'too', 'hard', 'warrant', 'actual', 'financial', 'losses', 'poor', 'sales', 'Who', 'ever', 'made', 'decisions', 'would', 'again', 'say', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'daft', 'heads', 'Carsey', 'Werner', 'should', 'fact', 'lose', 'jobs', 'errors', 'not', 'only', 'Roseanne', 'also', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'may', 'think', 'bit', 'much', 'selling', 'incomplete', 'product', 'especially', 'when', 'box', 'art', 'COMPLETE', 'first', 'season', 'fact', 'LIE', 'FALSE', 'Advertising', 'taking', 'money', 'others', 'job', 'done', 'poorly', 'think', 'transfers', 'episides', 'looked', 'fine', 'watched', 'Only', 'Two', 'episodes', 'was', 'more', 'angry', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'trying', 'really', 'wnjoy', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'anymore', 'that.I', 'think', 'everyone', 'involved', 'release', 'would', 'NOT', 'should', 'agree', 'sake', 'revenue', 'make', 'changes', 'get', 'sales', 'release', 'back', 'up', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'date', 'already', 'am', 'hearing', 'so', 'much', 'poor', 'feedback', 'fans', 'who', 'made', 'show', 'popular', 'really', 'deserve', 'more', 'time', 'are', 'sadly', 'let', 'down.If', 'anyone', 'questions', 'set', 'have', 'possession', 'please', 'ask', 'JackDVD78', '@', 'aol.com']",Roseanne: Season 1

It looks like the powers that be at Carsey-Werner and Anchor Bay have shot themselves in the foot. Cutting corners to save time and money does NOT pay off in the long run, people!The only reason I am giving this set 1 star is the for the bloopers, which were fun to watch. The interviews with Roseanne and John Goodman were nice too, but it would have been better to hear comments from the entire cast (ie. the fabulous Laurie Metcalf, and the kids).This first season was never my favorite as Roseanne was often still in ""stand-up"" mode. She would deliver a punchline then sort of hold there for a second with a big grin on her face while staring at her fellow actors. Her acting style improved greatly over the next few seasons as the show really found its footing, and no doubt she was influenced greatly by the undeniable thespian talents of Goodman and Metcalf.It is a disgrace that this set is plagued by its selection of syndication edits (even the opening theme is the shorter version; the original longer one had Dan eating the chip dip and kissing Roseanne, who wipes off her cheek with the back of her hand before letting go with her trademark cackle at the fade-out). Another give-away is the 1997 copyright at the end of the closing credits, which I recall from when the show began running on TBS in the fall of that year. True Roseanne fans can only hope that susbsequent seasons will indeed be composed of original network prints. Rumour has it that Carsey-Werner and Anchor Bay were disappointed with the sales of the Cosby Show's first season which suffered the same treatment and will indeed feature full-length uncut episodes from this point forward, so hopefully future releases of Roseanne will also be treated with the same loving care it deserves.Another minor beef I have is that they used fourth season promo photos on the box cover and menus. I do wish that the people in charge of DVD art/graphics would do their research. Rosey's ever-changing look was another trademark of this show, and this season should have featured her 1988 look, with the long curly hair and sweatshirt with the sleeves pushed up. Sorry to nitpick, but I'm a stickler for details!In conclusion, thanks to all the disgruntled consumers who voiced their dissatisfaction with this issue, we DID make a difference!

I WAS SO HAPPY THINKING THAT THIS GREAT SHOW WAS AT LAST GOING TO BE REVIVED BY DVD, BUT NOW I SEE THAT THIS BOX SET IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS TAPING THE RERUNS OFF OF NICK AT NITE. DO NOT BUY THIS SET. [...]The following review was written in May, before I knew that these discs contained cut episodes. The review praises the show, not the crappy DVDs Anchor bay has put out.So at long last one of the greatest (and certainly the most down to earth) sitcoms of all time finds a new home on the keepsake format known as DVD. A format which is popular with rerun addicts because the episodes are as fresh as the day they aired, free of syndication editing for time, and, better still, they are now free of commercials, particularly those horrible promos they now run during the course of the shows themselves. ROSEANNE comes from a better time when networks did not have the gaul to soil a show with pop-ups that sometimes take up half the screen and even have (shudder) sound effects. But then, ROSEANNE's time was a good old time anyway, the late eighties running through to the late nineties.After making a name for herself as a standup comedian, ROSEANNE finally got her own television show and got to do it her way. The series was centered on a working class mother and her family and gave most viewers a warm feeling of being right at home themselves with the shows original mix of real-life drama and sarcastic quips.The true crowning achievement of the show was it's ability to portray female characters as leads in a comedy and yet make them diversely different. Roseanne herself is a loud, bossy, control-freak with a heart of gold. Her sister Jackie (played with brilliance by Laurie Metcalf) is a neurotic, wishy-washy woman who can't keep a relationship or a job for long. Roseanne's daughters, Becky and Darlene, are total opposites and watching them go through puberty, marriage and life in general throughout the course of the show helped shaped them into important, well-developed characters. The show managed to have four female leads without being a hen-fest. Part of that can be attributed to the testosterone put on screen by the character Dan, Roseanne's husband and real man's man(played with equal brilliance by John Goodman). But more so, the show's success can be attributed to the fact that all the female leads are not banal, cookie cutter clich&eacute;s. Roseanne, in particular, broke the mold of pleasant female leads. She was likable, but not always pleasant. Her bitterness is what made her so funny, but her inner sweetness is what made her such a lovable Mom figure.Smart writing, rich character development, realistic plots, sometimes deep drama, and all around laughs carried the series for years until the last season or so fell apart in a zany mess. Once the family won the lotto it was all over. The show totally lost it's way and disintegrated in a horrible bastardization which mocked what had made it so great for all those years. But many years of greatness makes up for a sour ending, and the release of season one is more than welcome by legions of fans.Like most shows, the First Season of ROSEANNE is not the best. The characters had not grown into themselves yet  (DJ is even replaced). Roseanne and Jackie work in a factory and the episodes, while good, are more about getting the feel of the environment as a whole rather than getting deep into each individual part of the whole. But the first season is nonetheless hilarious and is a milestone in situation comedy and in the construction of female roles which differ from the  dull mainstream of ""the sex interest"", ""the sweet little girl"" or ""the wise old granny"".After a few seasons the show really came into it's own. Roseanne starts to job-hop, Dan and Darlene's bond starts to struggle because she is becoming a woman, the girls enter their teens and boys come into the picture (including the characters of Mark and his brother David, which become important male characters on the show that will stay until the series ends), Jackie becomes more neurotic and fickle which is sometimes hysterically funny and is at other times profoundly moving in it's realism, and Roseanne's shrew of a mother enters the picture, adding delightful insanity.It's a shame that this show died out the way it did. We could have grown old together with The Conner Family, or at least could have had a more realistic goodbye. A reunion show would be nice if they just ignored the plot which unfolded post-lotto. Unfortunately though, the actor Glen Quinn who played Mark died a few years back, which would make a reunion show even more complicated. John Goodman continues to make great film appearances (particularly in THE BIG LEBOWSKI, his best work), but the rest of the cast sort of vanished into obscure films and television appearances, including Roseanne herself. Her wild personal life aside, the woman is funny, and it is baffling that she could make such big mistakes after this show ended. First she did her talk show, which, to no one's surprise, bombed. Then, for about two episodes, she had that obnoxious reality show which revolved around her real family which were nowhere near as likable as the fictional Conners.ROSEANNE, like the roaring 90's themselves, are behind us now. But the memory of them both linger, and watching Roseanne is kind of like doing the time warp. You not only enjoy the show all over again, but you feel transported back in time, just like you would watching In LIVING COLOR or MARRIED WITH CHILDREN. Those shows have been on DVD for a while now, and rightly so. But ROSEANNE has been put off for far too long. I'm glad to see this original, groundbreaking series hit store shelves, out of the vaults and back into our hearts.WARNING: SINCE I WROTE THIS IN MAY IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT THIS BOX SET CONTAINS EDITED EPISODES OF THE SHOW!!!

They love the fact that you don't care, and as a result, they'll continue to release half-assed products.That's the power of such companies...stopping at nothing to make money. For TV shows, their best customers are the younger folks (teenagers or younger) who have never seen the show in its original run. They don't have a clue about the 2-3 minutes of missing footage that they're missing out on in syndication. Often times, those 2-3 minutes are just as funny, if not funnier than the 21-22 minutes that you DO see. The whole point about buying TV shows on DVD is to have the episodes of shows as they were meant to be seen...uncut and unedited. Why else would we, the customers, fork out our hard-earned money for some of our favorite TV shows? If all DVDs were edited, we'd be better off watching them on syndication.Of course, there are some cases where a company has no other choice but to release something edited...whether it be a music change, or the original episode being damaged/lost.

630697,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B00005JNF7,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[12, 17]","`Roseanne' was a groundbreaking show on so many levels that this DVD release is practically mandated. Based on the stand-up-comedy routine of Roseanne (then Barr) it critiqued the `domestic goddess' role that women were supposed to fit themselves into. Instead, Barr was a self-described `domestic goddess from hell'.In the glam 1980s, this show dared to present a working class family whose female lead was loud-mouthed, and overweight. Then, audiences were supposed to identify with the lead character, her family and the struggles they went through. We were intentionally supposed to like Roseanne exactly for who she was---rather than hoping she would change or feeling sorry for her family.In doing so, it upped the emotional ante from shows like All in the Family, Maude, and Good Times. Those series also had purported to show `tough lives' through the sitcom but the mothers on them were slim or somehow remained sweet-natured even after everything they went through. `Roseanne's' genius lies in that it made no such trade-offs. Roseanne is liberated because she has so many strikes against her.Both Roseanne Connor and husband Dan (John Goodman) find themselves frequently out of work. Although they love their family very much, they also don't hesitate to publicly vent steam when the kids drive them crazy during the 23-episode (1988-1988) season. The kids frequently have minds of their own, thus being a far cry from other television children who never misbehave badly.Favorite episodes include ""The memory game"" because Roseanne finds out that Dan had something with her high school nemesis, subsequently dredging up old feelings and creating tension in the Connor household. I also like ""The slice of life"" Darlene's emergency appendectomy concerns Roseanne who had yelled at her daughter earlier, affirming that family comes first. ""Death and stuff"" has the Connors in a brief panic because a door-to-door salesman has keeled over in their kitchen; wishing these people were dead is different than actually having to deal with it. Finally, ""Dear mom and dad"" is memorable because Roseanne's parents drive her family up the wall when they come over for a visit.Important episodes are ""Workin Overtime"" because Roseanne escapes her hectic life to muse in a dinner, and ""Let's call it quits"" because a tough new factory supervisor grates on her nerves. In later seasons, Roseanne leaves the plant to instead work at a dinner.In the first episode (""Life and stuff"") Sal Barrone was cast as David Jacob ""DJ"", the Connor's son. Apparently he and Sara Gilbert (Darlene) did not get along. He was replaced in subsequent episodes with Michael Fishman.Extras in this DVD release include Bloopers, Roseanne on Roseanne: a new candid interview, Season One highlights, Wisdom from the domestic goddess, Interview: John Goodman takes a look back. This with the uncut/non-syndicated episodes should satisfy the most ardent `Roseanne' fan.This season perfectly captures the magic of this series and should be purchased by people appreciating good sitcoms.",5,The 'domestic goddess from hell' finally comes to DVD,1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,3055,"['Roseanne', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'DVD', 'release', 'practically', 'mandated', 'Based', 'stand-up-comedy', 'routine', 'Roseanne', 'then', 'Barr', 'critiqued', 'domestic', 'goddess', 'role', 'women', 'were', 'supposed', 'fit', 'Instead', 'Barr', 'was', 'self-described', 'domestic', 'goddess', 'glam', '1980s', 'show', 'dared', 'present', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'female', 'lead', 'was', 'loud-mouthed', 'overweight', 'Then', 'audiences', 'were', 'supposed', 'identify', 'lead', 'character', 'family', 'struggles', 'went', 'were', 'intentionally', 'supposed', 'like', 'Roseanne', 'exactly', 'who', 'was', '-rather', 'hoping', 'would', 'change', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'family.In', 'doing', 'so', 'upped', 'emotional', 'ante', 'shows', 'Family', 'Maude', 'Good', 'Times', 'series', 'also', 'had', 'purported', 'show', 'tough', 'lives', 'sitcom', 'mothers', 'were', 'slim', 'somehow', 'remained', 'sweet-natured', 'even', 'everything', 'went', 'Roseanne', 'genius', 'made', 'such', 'trade-offs', 'Roseanne', 'liberated', 'so', 'many', 'strikes', 'Roseanne', 'Connor', 'husband', 'Dan', 'John', 'Goodman', 'find', 'frequently', 'work', 'love', 'family', 'very', 'much', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'publicly', 'vent', 'steam', 'when', 'kids', 'drive', 'crazy', '23-episode', '1988-1988', 'season', 'kids', 'frequently', 'have', 'minds', 'own', 'thus', 'being', 'far', 'cry', 'other', 'television', 'children', 'who', 'never', 'misbehave', 'badly.Favorite', 'episodes', 'include', 'memory', 'game', 'Roseanne', 'out', 'Dan', 'had', 'something', 'high', 'school', 'nemesis', 'subsequently', 'dredging', 'up', 'old', 'feelings', 'creating', 'tension', 'Connor', 'household', 'also', 'slice', 'life', 'Darlene', 'emergency', 'appendectomy', 'concerns', 'Roseanne', 'who', 'had', 'yelled', 'daughter', 'earlier', 'affirming', 'family', 'first', 'Death', 'stuff', 'Connors', 'brief', 'panic', 'door-to-door', 'salesman', 'keeled', 'kitchen', 'wishing', 'people', 'were', 'dead', 'different', 'actually', 'having', 'deal', 'Finally', 'Dear', 'mom', 'dad', 'memorable', 'Roseanne', 'parents', 'drive', 'family', 'up', 'wall', 'when', 'come', 'visit.Important', 'episodes', 'are', 'Workin', 'Overtime', 'Roseanne', 'hectic', 'life', 'muse', 'dinner', 'Let', 'call', 'tough', 'new', 'factory', 'supervisor', 'grates', 'nerves', 'later', 'seasons', 'Roseanne', 'plant', 'instead', 'work', 'dinner.In', 'first', 'episode', 'Life', 'stuff', 'Sal', 'Barrone', 'was', 'cast', 'David', 'Jacob', 'DJ', 'Connor', 'son', 'Apparently', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'Darlene', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'was', 'replaced', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'Michael', 'Fishman.Extras', 'DVD', 'release', 'include', 'Bloopers', 'Roseanne', 'Roseanne', 'new', 'candid', 'interview', 'Season', 'One', 'highlights', 'Wisdom', 'domestic', 'goddess', 'Interview', 'John', 'Goodman', 'look', 'back', 'uncut/non-syndicated', 'episodes', 'should', 'satisfy', 'most', 'ardent', 'Roseanne', 'fan.This', 'season', 'perfectly', 'magic', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'purchased', 'people', 'appreciating', 'good', 'sitcoms']",Roseanne: Season 1

She gets mad at Dan for not doing something and whines about it,then he does it and it's better than what she would have done and she gets even madder and whines even more.

There is at least 2 minutes cut out of each episode.

With no extras to speak of (including commentary), there is NO REASON to buy this box set.  This is a real shame, being that Roseanne is my favorite show and I couldn't wait to own the FULL, UNEDITED version with all the jokes back in that were removed for syndication.  Instead, I can get the same thing syndicated.  Just to make sure that I wasn't imagining this, I wrote Anchor Bay Entertainment asking if these are the edited episodes.  I waited until today to post this review, when I received a reply from Anchor Bay.  The Anchor Bay rep. that wrote me back said, and I quote: ""the DVD release is the syndicated version of the series.""  So why buy it?  Watch it on Nick at Night, tape it on video or TV and skip the commercials.  There is NOTHING new to see here.  Also, I wasn't impressed with the video quality.

Rosanne Arnold starred as the main character, Rosanne Connor. She and her husband Dan, were forever trying to manage, while holding-down marginal blue-collar jobs.When Rosanne premiered, the TV landscape was littered with sitcoms starring Yuppie characters, such as Seinfeld, Friends, Murphy Brown, etc. It was so refreshing to finally see a comedy like Rosanne, that was about the average working-stiff. Many more Americans, could identify with the down-to-earth issues that the Connors faced, than with the glamorous lives of the characters in the Yuppie-sitcoms.The considerable comic talents of the cast, were the main thing that made Rosanne such a brilliant sitcom. Rosanne Arnold is the most bombastically sarcastic comedienne, in the history of television. Female audiences were glad to finally see a sitcom matriarch, sound-off about her troubles in the gloriously uninhibited way that Rosanne did. John Goodman as Dan Connor, was the perfect foil for Rosanne's abrasive style of comedy. They were like a modern-day version of Ralph and Alice, in the Honeymooners.

In an era where Cosby ruled the airwaves, it was refreshing to watch a sitcom family that experienced the ups and downs of a REAL family, like ours. They had financial troubles. They fought - sometimes over trivial (but immediately recognizable to anyone with a family of their own) issues, sometimes about big things that threatened to tear them apart. These weren't always resolved within half an hour. The show tackled some heavy issues - domestic abuse, teenage pregnancy, mental illness, but didn't preach. They also covered the lighter side of family life, with episodes chronicling a day at the mall, or a teenaged daughter's first date. When it was good, Roseanne was very, very good. But when it was bad... Unfortunately, like many high rated television series, Roseanne did wear out it's welcome. The entire last season (as well as a fair amount of the other later seasons) was atrocious. The final episode, where we learn that the entire show's run was actually a novel written by Roseanne Connor about her family (with much creative license), was lame. The show really should have bowed out gracefully while on top of it's game several years earlier. The final years get zero stars from me, however, the earlier ones get five. It probably averages out to more like three stars, but I enjoyed the show too much overall to rate it lower than four.",4,But are the episodes edited? ;-),1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,1421,"['Roseanne', 'was', 'prime', 'one', 'best', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'made', 'era', 'where', 'Cosby', 'ruled', 'airwaves', 'was', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'sitcom', 'family', 'experienced', 'ups', 'downs', 'REAL', 'family', 'ours', 'had', 'financial', 'troubles', 'fought', 'sometimes', 'trivial', 'immediately', 'recognizable', 'anyone', 'family', 'own', 'issues', 'sometimes', 'big', 'things', 'threatened', 'tear', 'apart', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'resolved', 'hour', 'show', 'tackled', 'heavy', 'issues', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'teenage', 'pregnancy', 'mental', 'illness', 'did', ""n't"", 'preach', 'also', 'covered', 'lighter', 'side', 'family', 'life', 'episodes', 'chronicling', 'day', 'mall', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'first', 'date', 'When', 'was', 'good', 'Roseanne', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'when', 'was', 'bad', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'high', 'rated', 'television', 'series', 'Roseanne', 'did', 'wear', 'welcome', 'entire', 'last', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'fair', 'amount', 'other', 'later', 'seasons', 'was', 'atrocious', 'final', 'episode', 'where', 'learn', 'entire', 'show', 'run', 'was', 'actually', 'novel', 'written', 'Roseanne', 'Connor', 'family', 'much', 'creative', 'license', 'was', 'lame', 'show', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'bowed', 'out', 'gracefully', 'top', 'game', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'final', 'years', 'get', 'zero', 'stars', 'however', 'earlier', 'ones', 'get', 'five', 'probably', 'out', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'overall', 'rate', 'lower', 'four']",Roseanne: Season 1

(According to some of the newspaper sources I've seen, these episodes are edited down even farther than the syndicated versions shown daily on TV.)No way, am I paying for edited content, even though I think ""Roseanne"" remains one of TV's finest comedies, and one of the few that holds up under repeated viewings. Yes, the final season was dreadful--though the series finale episode was redeeming, if not spectacular--and there's no denying the content slipped from 1994 on (the horrible ""Gilligan's Island"" take-off and endless OJ references spring to mind), but, for me, ""Roseanne"" remains the ultimate ""comfort food"" TV, no weight-related pun intended. Even though I've seen the episodes so often I know many of the lines by heart, I still laugh every time I watch an old episode--which, thanks to plentiful reruns, is almost daily. There is no other show, ever, that I can say that about.And, as soon as they release unedited versions of the episodes on DVD, I'll buy the complete set. Until then, I'll be content with TV replays.UPDATE (2014): Many of the reviews, mine included, were made for the original 2005 DVD release of the Roseanne show (see:Roseanne: Season 1), where the season 1 DVD did feature edited episodes. This oversight has been corrected in later releases, including this one:Roseanne: Season 1, which features, full, unedited episodes.

I agree with the folks who've gone ahead and recorded the syndicated shows from Nick at Nite or wherever. The fans of ""Roseanne"" deserve to have the DVDs of the complete original airings of the show they made such a huge hit, and without the annoying banners (very distracting on all those channels) and logos in the corner through the entire shows.
