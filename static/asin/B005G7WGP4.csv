Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","I guess it was only a matter of time - what with today's heightened awareness of foreign threats - before jolly old St. Nick's sleigh is targeted by our U.S. air defenses. Hurtling at incomprehensible speeds this unidentified bogie is still vulnerable to missile bombardment from Homeland Security. And when Santa falls off the sleigh and crashes onto the docks, it's up to a pair of kids to save him - and Christmas - from an obsessed FBI agent.In Special Agent Erickson's (Greg Germann) defense, he thinks he's doing the world a solid. He's brushed up on extraterrestrial conspiracies. For years he's been tracking what he believes to be ""the human element in the intruder network."" But Special Agent Erickson is in the wrong film genre. This 2010 holiday flick, THE SANTA INCIDENT, is fantasy, not science-fiction. There may be folks onscreen with pointy ears, but they're not Vulcans. They're little helpers. Or, to be even more specific, they're the North Pole Search & Rescue party.Santa Claus (James Cosmo) ends up in the local hospital, being monitored by Nurse Joanna Johnson (Ione Skye) who also happens to be those two kids' mother. Stranded and with less than a week to go before Christmas and still needing to make the toys, Santa is taken in by the Johnsons. And, no, we won't question the soundness of a mother's inviting an absolute stranger over to one's home. It's Christmastime. Let's all buy into that whole ""good will toward men"" approach.THE SANTA INCIDENT is cute and silly and over-the-top. Above all, it's intended for kids, many of whom should get a kick out of the film's moments of mild skullduggery and Santa's collecting discarded scraps and shaping toys out of them. The grown-ups may find themselves raising their eyebrows some at Greg Germann's exaggerated bluster. I did chuckle a bit at his comic interactions with his inexperienced FBI partner. For the grown-ups, there's a smidge of romance as well. Fair warning, Ione Skye doesn't get wooed in near an epic fashion as she did in SAY ANYTHING. But, to reiterate, this movie isn't for the love birds. It's for the kids. 3 out of 5 stars.",3,it's what happens when Santa Claus invades U.S. air space,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,2123,"['guess', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'what', 'today', 'heightened', 'awareness', 'foreign', 'threats', 'jolly', 'old', 'St.', 'Nick', 'sleigh', 'targeted', 'U.S.', 'air', 'defenses', 'Hurtling', 'incomprehensible', 'speeds', 'unidentified', 'bogie', 'still', 'vulnerable', 'missile', 'bombardment', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'when', 'Santa', 'sleigh', 'crashes', 'docks', 'up', 'pair', 'kids', 'save', 'Christmas', 'obsessed', 'FBI', 'agent.In', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Erickson', 'Greg', 'Germann', 'defense', 'doing', 'world', 'solid', 'brushed', 'up', 'extraterrestrial', 'conspiracies', 'years', 'been', 'tracking', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'element', 'intruder', 'network', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Erickson', 'wrong', 'film', 'genre', '2010', 'holiday', 'flick', 'THE', 'SANTA', 'INCIDENT', 'fantasy', 'not', 'science-fiction', 'may', 'be', 'folks', 'onscreen', 'pointy', 'ears', ""'re"", 'not', 'Vulcans', ""'re"", 'little', 'helpers', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'specific', ""'re"", 'North', 'Pole', 'Search', 'Rescue', 'party.Santa', 'Claus', 'James', 'Cosmo', 'up', 'local', 'hospital', 'being', 'monitored', 'Nurse', 'Joanna', 'Johnson', 'Ione', 'Skye', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'two', 'kids', 'mother', 'Stranded', 'less', 'week', 'go', 'Christmas', 'still', 'needing', 'make', 'toys', 'Santa', 'taken', 'Johnsons', 'wo', ""n't"", 'question', 'soundness', 'mother', 'inviting', 'absolute', 'stranger', 'one', 'home', 'Christmastime', 'Let', 'buy', 'whole', 'good', 'will', 'men', 'SANTA', 'INCIDENT', 'cute', 'silly', 'over-the-top', 'intended', 'kids', 'many', 'whom', 'should', 'get', 'kick', 'film', 'moments', 'mild', 'skullduggery', 'Santa', 'collecting', 'discarded', 'scraps', 'shaping', 'toys', 'grown-ups', 'may', 'find', 'raising', 'eyebrows', 'Greg', 'Germann', 'exaggerated', 'bluster', 'did', 'chuckle', 'bit', 'comic', 'interactions', 'inexperienced', 'FBI', 'partner', 'grown-ups', 'smidge', 'romance', 'as', 'well', 'Fair', 'warning', 'Ione', 'Skye', ""n't"", 'get', 'wooed', 'epic', 'fashion', 'did', 'SAY', 'ANYTHING', 'reiterate', 'movie', ""n't"", 'love', 'birds', 'kids', '3', '5', 'stars']",The Santa Incident

The child actors seemed to play their parts much better than the adults, but I don't know if the problem was with the director or the cast.
