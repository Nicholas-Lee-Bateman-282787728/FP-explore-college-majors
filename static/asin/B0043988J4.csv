Surprisingly I liked it. It does remind me a bit of Trigun at least in concept but I think this is a much stronger plot and overall story. It certainly kept me on the edge of my seat as the ending neared and the thought of a final conflict with the comrade came closer. It does seem a bit unremittingly grim at times (rather like the later Battlestar Galactica) where evcerything is a struggle. The one bikini episode doesn't really fit, maybe the script writers had a day off.

1384097,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B0043988J4,Coulter Rail,"[2, 4]","I've been sifting through the S.A.V.E. titles looking for rare gems of animes that shouldn't be there.  ""Gun X Sword"" should.  This is an example of a product that is overstuffed with cloned material from successful anime, and as a result it resembles a horrifying Frankenstein monster of shows you like, and like Frankenstein's monster, it's ugly and likes little girls.The main character ""Van"" is a clone of ""Vash"" from ""Trigun"" and ""Spike"" from ""Bebop.""  He's on a vengeance quest, hunting down the man with the clawed hand, which thrusts you into the storyline of ""Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Blade of the Immortal, Samurai Champloo, The Fugitive, etc, etc.""  It's not a bad premise, but it's been done to death and this show doesn't offer anything new to it.Van's weapon is sword, that's also a whip, and also calls a robot from space.  All the bases covered yo!  That part is not too bad, as the animation is good and if the show would have just resigned itself to nonstop action then we might have something here.Action takes a back seat to a plethora of side characters that are predominantly female.  They're all there.  The cute, plucky girl that's looking for her brother has a childish insight that consistently digs up bottomless pits of tired morals, and offers to marry Van in the first episode.  There's the older, heavily busty, gypsy, vagabond, rebel that's too cool for school but carries a weathered heart of gold and who would also lay down for Van in a cheap second.  There's the Mech driving pixie that wants to have fun and fight so she naturally sees Van as a challenge in the cockpit and on the cockpit.  Anime shows that are girl crazy and laced with Lolita complexes are rampant and sometimes work, but it hurts Gun X Sword BADLY.The comedy is there and almost makes you laugh, but doesn't.  The fights are there and are almost cool, but instead neat.All in all, this is a show that serves as a perfect example of why taking every successful aspect of popular shows, eating them and crapping them out still just smells like crap.  As a S.A.V.E. title with good animation and standard fan service, you can enjoy it for what it is.  If you've seen a lot of animes though, you'll fall asleep on this one and be glad that it only took a small toll on your wallet and your time.",2,Nothing new here.

The only thing that was uncomfortable with the series and with what a few anime series have is the Lolita complex the producers put in the series,  I mean they have the female sidekick look like a middle elementary or junior high school kid though she's supposed to be older while trying to put some weird romantic plot between the two main characters even though the male character is drawn to look much older than the girl sidekick.  Luckily nothing happens with this situation really which was a very good thing and if you can look pass this the action and storyline for the series is actually pretty good,  The voice cast for the Japanese subbed and English dubbed did their character roles great as well so no complaints on that part either.
