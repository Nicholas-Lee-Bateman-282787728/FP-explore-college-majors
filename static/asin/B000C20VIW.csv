954409,AMZCQIDUWDHLC,B000C20VIW,John. N,"[0, 2]","When it comes to comedy, it goes without saying that I love comedians that appear to embrace what they talk about. While it's more than obvious why a comedian that fails to do so is doomed, there is nothing greater when the entire picture (looks and sincerity) come together. While comedians like George Carlin and Christopher Titus have a knack at deciphering what is wrong with society, Jim Gaffigan is a master at tackling the lighter aspects of human behavior, especially when it comes to people and their food stuffs. Point blank, I can't think of any other comedian that can comment on the foods we love (perhaps a bit too much) like Jim can. This doesn't make him as one dimensional as he's able to weave other subjects into his shows but it has more-or-less become his unofficial calling card and as a person who loves food I can't help but reflect on how true it really is.Still, as rosy as such a description is Gaffigan's brand of comedy runs into a little bit of trouble in DVD form. Given my first experience with Gaffigan's work was the audio recording of this show I was extremely disappointed to find the energy and spirit in Gaffigan's voice does not carry over into his stage presence. I was expecting him to be a bit more active in playing some of these bits out with a camera in front of him but as it stands his movement is light-years behind others like a seventy year-old George Carlin who, for obvious and well-justified reasons, can't jump around the stage like he use to.With such an argument placed in front of them, some people may be quick to defend Gaffigan and say his sheepish demeanor on stage is an extension of the lazy, offish person he claims to be. I thought of that as well but he just looks to fidgety and uncomfortable for it to be an act. If it is an act it isn't convincing and gives off an opposite, unintentional message. Do I want him to bop around the stage like Robin Williams? No. As much as I enjoy Williams' comedy one Robin Williams in the world is more than enough. I don't say this to be cruel but to point out that the video portion of this show adds next to nothing to the experience; the proof lies in the fact the audio portion of this show graces my CD player a lot more than the DVD graces my DVD player.Unlike the vast body of comedians out there, Gaffigan's shortcomings are easy to decipher and pass judgment on. While some may question why that may be good thing, it ultimately makes some decisions that would otherwise be difficult easier. While I'd expect some to point out how such an argument is self-defeating, it starts to make sense the more you think about it. From here it's only a short jump, skip and hop for one to discover why Gaffigan's material is as versatile as it is.",3,A super-stiff stage presence hurts an otherwise spectacular performance,1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,2749,"['When', 'comedy', 'saying', 'love', 'comedians', 'appear', 'embrace', 'what', 'talk', 'more', 'obvious', 'why', 'comedian', 'do', 'so', 'doomed', 'nothing', 'greater', 'when', 'entire', 'picture', 'looks', 'sincerity', 'come', 'together', 'comedians', 'George', 'Carlin', 'Christopher', 'Titus', 'have', 'knack', 'deciphering', 'what', 'wrong', 'society', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'master', 'tackling', 'lighter', 'aspects', 'human', 'behavior', 'especially', 'when', 'people', 'food', 'stuffs', 'Point', 'blank', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'comedian', 'can', 'comment', 'foods', 'love', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Jim', 'can', ""n't"", 'make', 'one', 'dimensional', 'able', 'weave', 'other', 'subjects', 'shows', 'more-or-less', 'become', 'unofficial', 'calling', 'card', 'person', 'who', 'food', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'reflect', 'how', 'true', 'really', 'is.Still', 'as', 'rosy', 'such', 'description', 'Gaffigan', 'brand', 'comedy', 'runs', 'little', 'bit', 'trouble', 'DVD', 'form', 'Given', 'first', 'experience', 'Gaffigan', 'work', 'was', 'audio', 'recording', 'show', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'find', 'energy', 'spirit', 'Gaffigan', 'voice', 'not', 'carry', 'over', 'stage', 'presence', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'active', 'playing', 'bits', 'out', 'camera', 'front', 'movement', 'light-years', 'others', 'seventy', 'year-old', 'George', 'Carlin', 'who', 'obvious', 'well-justified', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'jump', 'stage', 'use', 'to.With', 'argument', 'placed', 'front', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'quick', 'defend', 'Gaffigan', 'say', 'sheepish', 'demeanor', 'stage', 'extension', 'lazy', 'offish', 'person', 'be', 'thought', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'fidgety', 'uncomfortable', 'be', 'act', 'act', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'off', 'opposite', 'unintentional', 'message', 'Do', 'want', 'bop', 'stage', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'No', 'As', 'much', 'enjoy', 'Williams', 'comedy', 'one', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'world', 'more', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'be', 'cruel', 'point', 'out', 'video', 'portion', 'show', 'next', 'nothing', 'experience', 'proof', 'fact', 'audio', 'portion', 'show', 'CD', 'player', 'lot', 'more', 'DVD', 'graces', 'DVD', 'vast', 'body', 'comedians', 'there', 'Gaffigan', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'easy', 'decipher', 'pass', 'judgment', 'may', 'question', 'why', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'ultimately', 'decisions', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'difficult', 'easier', ""'d"", 'expect', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'such', 'argument', 'self-defeating', 'make', 'sense', 'more', 'think', 'here', 'only', 'short', 'jump', 'skip', 'hop', 'one', 'discover', 'why', 'Gaffigan', 'material', 'as', 'versatile']",Jim Gaffigan - Beyond the Pale

Jim Gaffigan's smart, understated style eviscerates everyday experience (Cinnabon, pregnancy, Hot Pockets, Catholicism).  His humor style relies on his unique angle: I'm that guy, he says, who only thinks about food and sex, and finds one of them pretty disappointing.  Then we realize we're that guy too.But just because Gaffigan plays clean doesn't mean he's gentle.  His comic reversals have all the punch we love from Bill Hicks or Kathy Griffin, stated in language that doesn't need bleeped on the networks.  He goes right to the heart of something we take for granted, identifying points we don't acknowledge, truths we cheerfully ignore.  It's weird: we can't help liking the guy, but we squirm as he talks.You can safely skip most of the DVD special features, which have the look of something thrown together hurriedly for the production house.  One feature deserves a look, though: a home video of Gaffigan's first amateur-night performance at a New York comedy dive.
