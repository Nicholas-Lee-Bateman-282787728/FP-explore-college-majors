As I expected, Malik steals the show in her supporting role as a neurotic socialite who suspects her son is Gay but ultimately learns that it's actually her unmarried brother(Jon Lindstrom) who is.Featured here is a very sweet ""May-December"" romance between a closeted and very wealthy 55 year old and a cute 30 year old Gay self-employed advertising agent(Chris Murrah)who's quite comfortable in his own skin and apparently doesn't have much interest in men his own age. The two men meet each other in the Philadelphia park outside their apartments where they go each day to walk their dogs--- two of the sweetest and most adorable little pooches you can imagine.Like most Gay-themed movies, this film is not without its share of stereotypical peripheral characters.

His sister, Elise (Wendie Malick), buys him a puppy to keep him company, and, while walking the puppy in park across from his luxury apartment, Paul meets Andy, a self-assured, intelligent 30-something gay man, who ignites a latent spark in Paul, who never considered he might not be heterosexual. Paul becomes more and more comfortable spending time with Andy, but can't reconcile the reality that he might want a loving, sexual relationship with another man.The screenwriter, Jay Arnold, deserves kudos for telling a realistic story about a man who has procrastinated on reconciling his sexuality for most of his life.  Despite a minimal budget and occasional over-acting, the film is good enough for mainstream distribution.  It's funny, with a light positive message, and is an excellent choice to screen for friends or relatives dealing with acceptance of someone in their lives who came out to them.Not rated, but would be a light R for sexual situations.

1514852,A224BKBLXVA859,B006FYYWQS,Rocky Sunico,"[0, 1]","Now to be fair, I can buy into the 55 year old gay awakening story angle. It's not completely unheard of and I've encountered friends who weren't able to come to terms with their sexuality until much later in life. But it would have helped if Paul had had other on the fly &#34;experiments&#34; over the years, even if only under the influence of alcohol. To have completely no idea about this side in him primarily because of conversations with a young guy in the park was a bit of a stretch, but I suppose one just have to buy into the movie logic at work here.And for the young man to claim to be wary about things in the beginning but still feel like he was somehow cheated or used in the process of becoming more intimate with Paul just felt very immature. I could see this turn coming from a mile a way but I still hoped against hope that it wouldn't go down this road. But of course a movie needs conflict and the first night together was of course going to be used as the vehicle for movie drama moments. I think the movie makers could have gone in a new direction in this area, but clearly it was an opportunity wasted.And it's a shame since there were some genuinely interesting moments during the various conversations between Paul and Andy. But all that had to give way to the predictably &#34;clever&#34; interconnections factored into the story once you bring in the plot threads related to Elise's son. They made sure there were plenty of reasons for the various characters to mix up the plot later in the movie. Paul was Brian's confidant while Elise already suspected he was gay. She tries to attend a PFLAG to better understand her son and this leads her to meeting Andy, who is a volunteer. Rince, lather and repeat.The movie isn't the rib-tickling variety of comedy. If ever, it's more the type of comedy that involves unusual or even uncomfortable situations that are supposed to be amusing to the audience. You will never really laugh in the movie but I guess you might smile a few times.
