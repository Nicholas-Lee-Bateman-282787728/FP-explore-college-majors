There is never a dull moment at the Thames House, the MI-5 Headquarters in London. The stories can seem repititious with fundamentalist terrorists trying to control the world or seek revenge sprinkled in are the formerly ""good"" spies who have now turned to the dark side.The constant character shift in MI-5 is amazing. Characters are killed or are sent away. No ones enter the picture. It is a constant shift. Peter Firth as Harry Pearce, the head of the MI-5, is the one constant and the glue that binds the series together. Nicola Walker as Ruth Evershed is my favorite. Lovely, insecure yet amazingly skilled with computer skills, Ruth is the other keystone in the series.The stories can be over the top but there is a fun to it and the series is addictive. Unlike in US shows, we usually know very quickly who the criminals are. With London's maize of close circuit TV cameras, every crime is caught on video. Add in MI-5's amazing Facial Recognition technology and the terrorist has a name. Our MI-5 spies are adept at breaking into homes and placing secret cameras and audio bugs. With all this technology, it still takes time to get the evidence needed for an arrest.The last episode leaves us with a serious cliff hanger. I have to hurry and get Season 5 to see what happens. A former spy has gone wild with ""proof"" that the MI-5 was responsible for Princess Diana's death. What is the real truth?Season 4 did not delve as much into the personal lives and conflicts of the spies and the previous seasons, although there is one major cast change and the emotional conflict this causes.The series if fun and addictive.

1021065,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B000IJ7AEC,"Ray ""A Reader""","[1, 1]","Moving into its Fourth Season, MI-5 retains its seemingly impossible-to-achieve status as one of the smartest, most intelligent, and most dramatic shows you'll ever see. ""MI-5"" is about a group of British citizen individuals who join ""5"" to help ""defend the realm."" (MI-5 is that branch of the British secret service that is focused on domestic threats, be they economic, terrorist, civil uprisings, or any externally originating threat that has found its way back to the UK; a sister branch, MI-6, not a part of this show, deals more exclusively with external threats to the country.) The series introduces us to all kinds of real-world threats--both potential and operationally real--and shows how the members of 5 must react in order to counter and/or eliminate these threats. The series is so well written, produced, directed, filmed, and acted that each episode is more of a 60-minute movie than a television episode. The drama, intrigue, intelligent stories, and, yes, action, establish the series as a standout among even the often high-achieving BBC (already the producer of many world-class shows), making it with little doubt one of the best shows of this nature ever made.Season Four again focuses on a new series of threats to the UK, and, perhaps more than any other season to date, has a ""thematic"" flavor that carries through the entire season. And although it seems increasingly impossible that the show could ever match the emotional excitement and achievement of each last season, Season Four raises the bar once again and seems to defy all ""regression to the mean."" I liken the show to one of those plate twirlers who gets a plate spinning up in the air at the top of one of those skinny sticks, and while you are trying to understand how he is doing it, starts another plate stirring on a second stick while keeping the first going. And then, to your incredulity, he adds yet a third plate on a third stick, and now maintains all three plates. You scratch your head with amazement even as you watch him keep all three plates twirling on those sticks, and yet he does it right in front of you. That's what MI-5 is like as you enter the third and fourth seasons.Because of the complexity and the intellectual development of characters (as well as the plots themselves), it is best to watch MI-5 in order by episode, with no skipping of episodes, and this makes the DVD release of the show perhaps the very best manner in which to view the production. The DVDs allow you to step your way through each season, episode by episode, thereby viewing the show in the manner in which it was intended to be viewed. This gives you the ability to watch how characters are developed, and to better gain an understanding of how the MI-5 Section D group works. With the exception of the very first episode of Season One (the first episode is really not up to the standards of all the remaining ones, an issue attributable to the difficulties inherent in plot development) the shows are incredibly exciting, but also intelligently written in a way that will make you re-think the issues surrounding the role of the security forces in countries, what actions should and should not be allowed, the best way to address classes of threats, the implications for a free society when eliminating threats, the intersection of political and security concerns, and much more. You might at first glace think that MI-5, as an entertainment production, would be no more than that; but MI-5 is certainly more than a simple entertainment show. Be prepared to be entertained, but also mentally stimulated.This is a truly amazing show. It's easily seven stars out of five. And the prices of the discs have come down dramatically from earlier years. But don't forget: you need to watch these IN ORDER. If you haven't seen it yet, start with Season One, work your way through that first not-so-good episode, and then watch the thing take of a like a jet. You'll be hooked by the time you get to the end of Season One.The Seasons:MI-5, Volume 1MI-5, Volume 2MI-5, Volume 3MI-5, Volume 4MI-5: Volume 5MI-5, Volume 6MI-5, Volume 7MI-5: Volume 8Mi-5: Volume 9Volume 10 not yet released (Dec 2011)",5,SEVEN Stars Out of Five ...

America and the CIA suck, MI6 generally sucks, MI5 is good. Can't remember which episode but when London came within feet of being obliterated by a Thermal Nuclear Bomb, I was so relieved that a total of four MI5 agents, under the age of 30, two of which had never received any agent training, saved the world, so to speak. And, they were good looking with nonBritish teeth. Every time America is mentioned I know there is evil on the cusp. Kind of like our Law and Order.
