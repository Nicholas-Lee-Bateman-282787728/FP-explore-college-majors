I got the first season, and i hope that the rest of the seasons will dcom eout, the 2-5 seasons. And i hope it comes out, thank you for answereing me.i voted for other people's reviews and agreed with what said they happen to say and i like what they happen to say. and  also the last i wrote to you was 1 years ago and i am still waiting for the rest of the series to come out, so what's the holdup? i not getting any younger and other people out there that are waiting are the same way, i'm in my late 40's . We want to know how much longer are we going to have to wait and not going to wait another 2 or 3 years , i think it's dumb for you to keep the fans waiting for them. Get them out, we can be patient for so long. You put them out then make the fans wait for so long for the rest to come out. i will wait for another year and if you haven't brought them out by then, you will be hearing from me again.",4,Fall Guy,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,1018,"['Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'Guy', 'just', 'come', 'out', 'was', 'waiting', 'ccome', 'out', 'wan', 'sign', 'up', 'got', 'first', 'season', 'i', 'hope', 'rest', 'seasons', 'will', 'dcom', 'eout', '2-5', 'seasons', 'i', 'hope', 'out', 'thank', 'answereing', 'me.i', 'voted', 'other', 'people', 'reviews', 'agreed', 'what', 'said', 'happen', 'say', 'i', 'what', 'happen', 'say', 'also', 'last', 'i', 'wrote', 'was', '1', 'years', 'ago', 'i', 'am', 'still', 'waiting', 'rest', 'series', 'come', 'out', 'what', 'holdup', 'i', 'not', 'getting', 'younger', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'waiting', 'are', 'same', 'way', 'i', ""'m"", 'late', '40', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'wait', 'not', 'going', 'wait', '2', '3', 'years', 'i', 'think', 'dumb', 'keep', 'fans', 'waiting', 'Get', 'out', 'can', 'be', 'patient', 'so', 'long', 'put', 'out', 'then', 'make', 'fans', 'wait', 'so', 'long', 'rest', 'come', 'out', 'i', 'will', 'wait', 'year', 'have', ""n't"", 'brought', 'out', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'hearing', 'again']",N/A
