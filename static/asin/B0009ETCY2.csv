904576,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B0009ETCY2,Andrew Raker,"[16, 17]","Firstly, this film (like any other OCS adaptation) does not fully and sufficiently develop the cast of characters. For some reason, no one seems to want a 500 minute adaptation of ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" where a lot of Dickens' original dialogue is kept.Having qualified myself, this is my favorite adaptation of ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" by Charles Dickens.To contrast this adaptation with those of the BBC:1.This film emphasizes Nelly and her grandfather, especially her grandfather's addiction to gambling. BBC emphasizes the villainous Mr. Quilp and his insatible desire for revenge.2.This film does contain at least as many of the minor characters as the BBC adaptations. While the minor characters are not developed very well (Kit's character for example), they developed almost as well as in the BBC.3.One of the worst things about this film is the piece-working together of scenes. In 2006 BBC, music in front of large houses signifies a shift in residence. In this Disney adaptation, you must watch carefully or become confused (especially if you have not read the novel.)BOTTOM LINE:I could not give the film 5 stars because of its compression of plot and underdevelopment of characters. However, I know of no other adaptation that is better than this one.Also, I would warn you that the aspect ratio is 4:3, just in case you only enjoy widescreen productions.",4,Not the BBC Bleak House '86 or '06 yet surprisingly good,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,1370,"['Firstly', 'film', 'other', 'OCS', 'adaptation', 'not', 'fully', 'sufficiently', 'develop', 'cast', 'characters', 'reason', 'one', 'want', '500', 'minute', 'adaptation', 'Old', 'Curiosity', 'Shop', 'where', 'lot', 'Dickens', 'original', 'dialogue', 'kept.Having', 'qualified', 'favorite', 'adaptation', 'Old', 'Curiosity', 'Shop', 'Charles', 'Dickens.To', 'contrast', 'adaptation', 'BBC:1.This', 'film', 'Nelly', 'grandfather', 'especially', 'grandfather', 'addiction', 'gambling', 'BBC', 'villainous', 'Mr.', 'Quilp', 'insatible', 'desire', 'revenge.2.This', 'film', 'contain', 'least', 'many', 'minor', 'characters', 'BBC', 'adaptations', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'very', 'well', 'Kit', 'character', 'example', 'developed', 'almost', 'as', 'well', 'BBC.3.One', 'worst', 'things', 'film', 'piece-working', 'together', 'scenes', '2006', 'BBC', 'music', 'front', 'large', 'houses', 'shift', 'residence', 'Disney', 'adaptation', 'must', 'watch', 'carefully', 'become', 'confused', 'especially', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'compression', 'plot', 'underdevelopment', 'characters', 'However', 'know', 'other', 'adaptation', 'better', 'one.Also', 'would', 'warn', 'aspect', 'ratio', '4:3', 'just', 'case', 'only', 'enjoy', 'widescreen', 'productions']",N/A

904582,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B0009ETCY2,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[2, 4]","Most of Dickens' interpretations to film are well thought out and brought to life, but this is probably the weakest version of a Dickens novel I've seen on film. The most notable problem is that the essence of characters and their relationships to other characters is glossed over in a rather flimsy manner. In the novel, Quilp is such a dirtbag and villain, being abusive to his wife and taking pleasure in others misery that you take an active role in hating him. In this version, Quilp just seems to be a rather unpleasant, unlikable fellow, but his true villainy isn't explored. When we read the book, the differences between hateful Quilp and innocent Nell underscore the idea of evil vs. goodness in the world, something the film misses. Another issue is that the film is ineffective in filling in the gaps of the plot like most solid Dickens' films do. One example: one minute the grandfather is talking rationally to Nell, the next he is blubbering out of control like a baby. The attempts to characterize his problems with gambling and his want of success for Nell are done in a half-hearted manner, and so, as with much of the story, it has a real overdone, choppy effect that doesn't come across as genuine. The spirit of the story just doesn't ring forth here.Another problem specifically with the DVD itself is that the sound quality and transfer are poor, with the dialogue often being muddled.There have been successful  Dickens' movies from some of his rather lengthy novels, including recent ones such as Little Dorritt (2009), Our Mutual Friend (2005), and Bleak House (2009). Also, a few more of interest are Great Expectations (1999 Masterpiece Theatre version  or 1949 David Lean version ), David Copperfield (2006), and Oliver Twist (1949). Any of these are highly recommended.I haven't watched any of the other versions of The Old Curiosity Shop, but I've heard that the 1979 version is much better.

I enjoyed everything about this presentation with one glaring exception and that was the acting of Peter Ustinov.  Down through the years I've seen Sir Peter in many films and to me each of his portrayals simply reeked of ACTING.  Never, have I seen him give, to me, a convincing portrayal of the character that he was supposed to be playing.  Likewise, this presentation of Dickens's ""The Old Curiosity Shop"".  In each scene I was made fully aware that Sir Peter was ACTING!  Not for one moment did I ever feel that he had become the character.  All that I could see in the film was Peter Ustinov going through his ACTING routine. The other acting, especially by Tom Courtenay as the nasty landlord, was great; however that, for me, was NOT enough because Sir Peter is in most of the scenes of the film which, I'm afraid, ruined it for me.If you adore Peter's acting definitely buy this DVD",3,ALL EXCEPT SIR PETER,1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,999,"['totally', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'great', 'production', 'wonderful', 'Dickens', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'everything', 'presentation', 'one', 'glaring', 'exception', 'was', 'acting', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'Down', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sir', 'Peter', 'many', 'films', 'portrayals', 'simply', 'reeked', 'ACTING', 'Never', 'have', 'seen', 'give', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'character', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'playing', 'Likewise', 'presentation', 'Dickens', 'Old', 'Curiosity', 'Shop', 'scene', 'was', 'made', 'fully', 'aware', 'Sir', 'Peter', 'was', 'ACTING', 'Not', 'one', 'moment', 'did', 'ever', 'feel', 'had', 'become', 'character', 'could', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'going', 'ACTING', 'routine', 'other', 'acting', 'especially', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'nasty', 'landlord', 'was', 'great', 'however', 'was', 'NOT', 'enough', 'Sir', 'Peter', 'most', 'scenes', 'film', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'ruined', 'me.If', 'adore', 'Peter', 'acting', 'definitely', 'buy', 'DVD']",N/A

904589,AJGP5XYKKBGBG,B0009ETCY2,Reliable Reviews,"[4, 4]","This 1994-version with Peter Ustinov as the grandfather is the best version. 3-hours, in color. The appeal of this film is the colorful and interesting bad-guys scheming against the grandfather and each other, and the perils of sweet, young, Nell. Up until 1869, a few years after the American Civil War, there really were debtors'-prisons in England. If you could not pay your debt; your creditor could have you dragged off to prison. This is a story about a vindictive creditor who wants to throw the grandfather in debtors' prison or worse, and the grandfather trying to elude him.In this version, Mr. Quilp, the creditor, steals the show as the petty, vindictive, scheming, bad-guy, who enjoys doing evil. No one could play this bad guy better. A nice young woman twenty years younger than Mr. Quilp, who was poor and destitute, marries him to escape poverty, but brings her mother along to live with them.There are several other colorful characters, such as Mr. Swiveller, the lazy bum gentleman suitor wanting to marry Nell. There is the crooked, obsequious, lawyer Mr. Brass and his icy sister who conspire with Mr. Quilp to harm the grandfather. There is the mysterious, dignified, wealthy, gentleman, making inquiries about the grandfather.This film is intriguing from beginning to end. Some glimpses of beautiful scenery as they travel the countryside. Some sarcasm and humor from Mr. Quilp.A good ending is critically important. I removed 1-star for a lackluster ending. The script-writer should have re-written Mr. Dickens' ending, which would have required re-writing the relationship between Nell and her grandfather, which I detail under the ""comment"" button below.The characters of the other, 2007 abd 1979 versions are not as colorful.

The details, even those in the background, are impeccable.Moreover, it is faithful to the novel.  One reviewer for Amazon criticized the bittersweet ending, but the denouement was Charles Dickens' own.  I thought everyone knew the ending--as everyone knows how ""Gone With the Wind"" turns out--or ""Hamlet"" or just about any other standard work of fiction.  Knowing the ending surely does not ruin the movie or book for any knowledgable viewer or reader.The acting is perfect and should have garnered every award for the year this was made.  The portrayals of the grandfather, Little Nell, Quilp, his lawyer, etc. are not to be forgotten.
