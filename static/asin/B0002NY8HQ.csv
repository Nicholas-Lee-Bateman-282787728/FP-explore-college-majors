841830,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0002NY8HQ,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[2, 2]","In one of the only good reality shows I've ever seen (The Amazing Race is pretty cool), man-of-one-thousand-faces Jamie Kennedy pulls innocent pranks on unsuspecting people.  After a great first season, Kennedy only continues to amaze.  This year has what is probably one of the two funniest bits in the entire series: the Japanese restaurant gag!  It involves Kennedy playing the owner of a sushi bar.  He is married to a Japanese woman and has an all-Japanese staff, but he doesn't speak a word of Japanese, so when his wife and staff bad-mouth him in Japanese, he is none the wiser.  The mark in the bit DOES speak Japanese, and overhears everything (and some of the things are pretty crude).  Other great bits include the return of Lou the Driving Instructor, who is now a paper boy mentor, and they actually show two different marks.  The ""official"" one involves a kid that worked very well.  The second one involved a mark who was a bit unscrupulous, and Jamie was scared senseless throughout the entire bit.  We also get the amazing Mardi Gras double episode that was filmed on location in New Orleans (which would actually set up the Road Trip theme for Season 3).  This was probably one of the most consistently funny episodes from throughout the entire series.  In one experiment, he even played two parts (the hilarious voodoo doll bit).While this show won't be the most remembered show a decade from now, it is hilarious and definitely worth a look.",5,Another Great Season of Experiments,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,1461,"['one', 'only', 'good', 'reality', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'pretty', 'cool', 'man-of-one-thousand-faces', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'innocent', 'pranks', 'unsuspecting', 'people', 'great', 'first', 'season', 'Kennedy', 'only', 'amaze', 'year', 'what', 'probably', 'one', 'two', 'funniest', 'bits', 'entire', 'series', 'Japanese', 'restaurant', 'gag', 'Kennedy', 'playing', 'owner', 'sushi', 'bar', 'married', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'all-Japanese', 'staff', ""n't"", 'speak', 'word', 'Japanese', 'so', 'when', 'wife', 'staff', 'bad-mouth', 'Japanese', 'none', 'wiser', 'mark', 'bit', 'DOES', 'speak', 'Japanese', 'overhears', 'everything', 'things', 'are', 'pretty', 'crude', 'Other', 'great', 'bits', 'include', 'return', 'Lou', 'Driving', 'Instructor', 'who', 'now', 'paper', 'boy', 'mentor', 'actually', 'show', 'two', 'different', 'marks', 'official', 'one', 'kid', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'second', 'one', 'involved', 'mark', 'who', 'was', 'bit', 'unscrupulous', 'Jamie', 'was', 'scared', 'senseless', 'entire', 'bit', 'also', 'get', 'amazing', 'Mardi', 'Gras', 'double', 'episode', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'New', 'Orleans', 'would', 'actually', 'set', 'up', 'Road', 'Trip', 'theme', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'consistently', 'funny', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'experiment', 'even', 'played', 'two', 'parts', 'hilarious', 'voodoo', 'doll', 'bit', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'most', 'remembered', 'show', 'decade', 'now', 'hilarious', 'definitely', 'look']",N/A

Please join me on a journey, while I tell you about my favorite hidden camera show.I happen to be flipping channels, and ended up on the WB, one Thursday night, about 9 p.m. I saw Jamie Kennedy introducing a segment. He was explaining about a new rapper sensation, named Brad Gluckman. I was distracted, temporarily, by my young newborn son. I began watching the segment, laughing my head off, and thinking Brad Gluckman was so funny. Who was this guy? It wasn't until the end of the segment, and Jamie made the reveal, that I realized Jamie Kennedy and Brad Gluckman were one and the same. And I realized at that moment that I had found my new favorite Hidden Camera show!After that I was hooked every Thursday. I even converted some of my relatives and friends over to the Jamie Kennedy addiction. I then began taping every show I could find. Of course, I had a load of VHS tapes, after this.Jamie plays many roles.  Normally he is in a protaganist role, who interacts with the person being fooled, the ""mark"" who believes everthing that is happening is real.  He/she is later let off, when Jamie reveals to him/her and the audience, that they've been ""X'd.""  Thus the Jamie Kennedy eXperiment.I bought the Season 1 DVD the day it was in stores.  The same for this one.  I bought this one in October, 2004, while I was on vacation down in Aneheim, California at Disneyland.  Yep, that's right.  I actually searched out a store, and picked this up on the day of launch while on vacation.  I had to go to two different stores to find it.Some of my favorite episodes in this season include the following:1) Jamie pretends to be the blushing bride at a surprise Las Vegas Wedding.  Surprise mom, your son is getting married today.  Surprise mom, he's marrying a woman who used to be a man.  The voiceover on this one is priceless, as Jamie tell us, for example, the upset mother, and her family are sucking down martini's and beers at 10 in the morning.  Gee, I wonder why?  Also, comical, is the banter between Jamie and his future Mother-in-law:  Jamie: ""Can I come over for Sunday barbecues?""  ""Why don't you like me, do I look fat in this dress?""  Very long, but very believable, in an un-believable sort of way.2) Guys Gone Nuts!  Jamie and his entourage take over Austin, Texas.  He recruits several males who are shown making crazy moves in different dance clubs, in various states of undress.  (Nudity is censored.)  The tapes are shown, showing tons of young women fawning excitement over the male sex symbols.  Then the men are escorted back to present time, to meet some of their adorning fans.  Jamie, playing a producer, shows the stars the tape he has created of their performance.  Uhh ohh!  He forgot to mention that the tapes aren't being marketed to young women, but to lots of funloving men!  He intersplices halarious male reaction to the new recruits' dance moves.  The marks begin to realize they've been had!  Absolutely halarious!3) Jamie plays a Live-stage Director, who has re-written the movie Mystery Ship into a ""Singing-Dancing Live Stage version. This one is great, to see the awful acting and singing of the actors, who have no idea they are being fooled.  When the real Director of the movie shows up, and starts screaming at Jamie when he hears and sees the awful results, I am laughing at the top of my lungs, it is so funny.Highly recommended, I loved it better than the first season.Only complaint, would be, it would be nice to see more special materials, such as behind the scenes filming of the behind the scenes folks who make these gags works. We rarely get a chance to see their side of the story. The commentaries are great, and would have liked to hear more, but if it means we get the DVD's released quicker, so much the better.All in all, very well done, and supper funny. I like the outside jacket artwork and photos, and the disc covers as well.Great job Jamie!",5,Jamie Kennedy:  Take Two!,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,3983,"['love', 'series', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'show', 'Please', 'join', 'journey', 'tell', 'favorite', 'hidden', 'camera', 'show.I', 'happen', 'be', 'flipping', 'channels', 'ended', 'up', 'WB', 'one', 'Thursday', 'night', 'about', '9', 'p.m', 'saw', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'introducing', 'segment', 'was', 'explaining', 'new', 'rapper', 'sensation', 'named', 'Brad', 'Gluckman', 'was', 'distracted', 'temporarily', 'young', 'newborn', 'son', 'began', 'watching', 'segment', 'laughing', 'head', 'thinking', 'Brad', 'Gluckman', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'Who', 'was', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'end', 'segment', 'Jamie', 'made', 'reveal', 'realized', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'Brad', 'Gluckman', 'were', 'one', 'same', 'realized', 'moment', 'had', 'found', 'new', 'favorite', 'Hidden', 'Camera', 'show', 'was', 'hooked', 'Thursday', 'even', 'converted', 'relatives', 'friends', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'addiction', 'then', 'began', 'taping', 'show', 'could', 'find', 'course', 'had', 'load', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'this.Jamie', 'many', 'roles', 'Normally', 'protaganist', 'role', 'who', 'person', 'being', 'fooled', 'mark', 'who', 'everthing', 'happening', 'real', 'He/she', 'later', 'let', 'off', 'when', 'Jamie', 'him/her', 'audience', ""'ve"", 'been', 'X', ""'d"", 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'eXperiment.I', 'bought', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'day', 'was', 'stores', 'same', 'one', 'bought', 'one', 'October', '2004', 'was', 'vacation', 'down', 'Aneheim', 'California', 'Disneyland', 'Yep', 'right', 'actually', 'searched', 'out', 'store', 'picked', 'up', 'day', 'launch', 'vacation', 'had', 'go', 'two', 'different', 'stores', 'find', 'it.Some', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'include', 'following:1', 'Jamie', 'be', 'blushing', 'bride', 'surprise', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Wedding', 'Surprise', 'mom', 'son', 'getting', 'married', 'today', 'Surprise', 'mom', 'marrying', 'woman', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'man', 'voiceover', 'one', 'priceless', 'Jamie', 'tell', 'example', 'upset', 'mother', 'family', 'are', 'sucking', 'down', 'martini', 'beers', '10', 'morning', 'Gee', 'wonder', 'why', 'Also', 'comical', 'banter', 'Jamie', 'future', 'Mother-in-law', 'Jamie', 'Can', 'come', 'Sunday', 'barbecues', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'look', 'fat', 'dress', 'Very', 'long', 'very', 'believable', 'un-believable', 'sort', 'way.2', 'Guys', 'Gone', 'Nuts', 'Jamie', 'entourage', 'take', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'several', 'males', 'who', 'are', 'shown', 'making', 'crazy', 'moves', 'different', 'dance', 'clubs', 'various', 'states', 'undress', 'Nudity', 'censored', 'tapes', 'are', 'shown', 'showing', 'tons', 'young', 'women', 'fawning', 'excitement', 'male', 'sex', 'symbols', 'Then', 'men', 'are', 'escorted', 'back', 'present', 'time', 'meet', 'adorning', 'fans', 'Jamie', 'playing', 'producer', 'stars', 'tape', 'created', 'performance', 'Uhh', 'ohh', 'forgot', 'mention', 'tapes', 'are', ""n't"", 'being', 'marketed', 'young', 'women', 'lots', 'funloving', 'men', 'halarious', 'male', 'reaction', 'new', 'recruits', 'dance', 'moves', 'marks', 'begin', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'Absolutely', 'halarious', '3', 'Jamie', 'Live-stage', 'Director', 'who', 're-written', 'movie', 'Mystery', 'Ship', 'Singing-Dancing', 'Live', 'Stage', 'version', 'one', 'great', 'see', 'awful', 'acting', 'singing', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'are', 'being', 'fooled', 'When', 'real', 'Director', 'movie', 'up', 'screaming', 'Jamie', 'when', 'awful', 'results', 'am', 'laughing', 'top', 'lungs', 'so', 'funny.Highly', 'recommended', 'loved', 'better', 'first', 'season.Only', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'special', 'materials', 'such', 'scenes', 'filming', 'scenes', 'folks', 'who', 'make', 'gags', 'works', 'rarely', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'side', 'story', 'commentaries', 'are', 'great', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'more', 'get', 'DVD', 'released', 'quicker', 'so', 'much', 'better.All', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'supper', 'funny', 'outside', 'jacket', 'artwork', 'photos', 'disc', 'well.Great', 'job', 'Jamie']",N/A
