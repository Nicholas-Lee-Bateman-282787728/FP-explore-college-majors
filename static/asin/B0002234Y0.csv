Like her, I went to Best Buy on my lunch hour and picked up a copy.  Nobody was buying armloads of them.  Heck, there were still 12 copies on the shelf when I left.  The staff there had no knowledge of the Warner Bros. cancellation/postponement either, so I'm still confused as to what the problem is all about.  If you want to pay $200 or more for a copy from someone else, that is your decision.  However, I would advise looking around first, or make some calls to your local retailers (that's what I did).

821215,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,B0002234Y0,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[2, 2]","Having praised the first season, I must say, that while the show is still very good, the second season is not as good as the first season.  My overall sense is that the powers that be unfortunately saw only one thing in their very powerful show: the ""chemistry"" between Peta Wilson (Nikita) and Roy Dupuis (Michael).  In many respects season two is a repeat of season one, only with the focus on Roy's character, Michael.  Yes, the stories are different, but the themes and statements about relationships are the same.  As openly stated in the commentaries, they producers/staff were focusing on the ""sexual tension"" that Roy and Peta engendered in their performances--a huge mistake, from my perspective, that nearly stalled the show.  Again, I feel that the best attribute of season one was that the show took a ""hard look at the realities of relationships mirrored by the microscopic world of Nikita."" Sadly, the second season failed to fully build on that foundation, and instead focused on ""teasing"" viewers with the never ending ""sexual tension.""  I personally did not care for the character reversals of Michael and Nikita; indeed, I often felt I was watching ""Le Femme Michael"" instead of Le Femme Nikita.  On the other hand, the second season did incorporate what I believe is referred to as a ""B story line;"" that is, the development of other characters in the Nikita environment: Operations, Madeline, Walter, and Birkoff.  In doing so, they introduced more varied forms of relationships that ultimately--and thankfully--saved the show.  In spite of my stated ""problems"" with the second season, overall the second season still provided outstanding performances, and many of my comments about the first season hold true for the second season.Please keep in mind that I never saw the show on television, and, therefore, my observations are based upon viewing the episodes from the DVD box set.  As for ""missing"" extras or other ""problems"" other reviewers have found with the quality of the DVDs, I again must state that this is a late 1990s show made on a small budget and packaging/description errors do happen.  Conversely, I would agree that it would be nice to hear a commentary or two by Peta Wilson; but, in the final analysis, it is the opportunity to watch an outstanding television show--sans ads--that is most important.",5,Still a great show,1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,2339,"['Having', 'praised', 'first', 'season', 'must', 'say', 'show', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'second', 'season', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'overall', 'sense', 'powers', 'be', 'unfortunately', 'saw', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'very', 'powerful', 'show', 'chemistry', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'Nikita', 'Roy', 'Dupuis', 'Michael', 'many', 'respects', 'season', 'two', 'repeat', 'season', 'one', 'only', 'focus', 'Roy', 'character', 'Michael', 'Yes', 'stories', 'are', 'different', 'themes', 'statements', 'relationships', 'are', 'same', 'openly', 'stated', 'commentaries', 'producers/staff', 'were', 'focusing', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Roy', 'Peta', 'engendered', 'performances', 'huge', 'mistake', 'perspective', 'nearly', 'stalled', 'show', 'Again', 'feel', 'best', 'attribute', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'show', 'took', 'hard', 'look', 'realities', 'relationships', 'mirrored', 'microscopic', 'world', 'Nikita', 'Sadly', 'second', 'season', 'failed', 'fully', 'build', 'foundation', 'instead', 'focused', 'teasing', 'viewers', 'never', 'ending', 'sexual', 'tension', 'personally', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'character', 'reversals', 'Michael', 'Nikita', 'indeed', 'often', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'Le', 'Femme', 'Michael', 'instead', 'Le', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'other', 'hand', 'second', 'season', 'did', 'incorporate', 'what', 'believe', 'referred', 'B', 'story', 'line', 'development', 'other', 'characters', 'Nikita', 'environment', 'Operations', 'Madeline', 'Walter', 'Birkoff', 'doing', 'so', 'introduced', 'more', 'varied', 'forms', 'relationships', 'ultimately', 'thankfully', 'saved', 'show', 'spite', 'stated', 'problems', 'second', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'still', 'provided', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'many', 'comments', 'first', 'season', 'hold', 'true', 'second', 'season.Please', 'keep', 'mind', 'never', 'saw', 'show', 'television', 'therefore', 'observations', 'are', 'based', 'viewing', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'missing', 'extras', 'other', 'problems', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'found', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'again', 'must', 'state', 'late', '1990s', 'show', 'made', 'small', 'budget', 'packaging/description', 'errors', 'do', 'happen', 'Conversely', 'would', 'agree', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'hear', 'commentary', 'two', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'final', 'analysis', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'outstanding', 'television', 'show', 'ads', 'most', 'important']",La Femme Nikita: The Complete Second Season

Lopez ""Jen_1013""","[1, 1]","Season One left you on the edge of your seat for four or five months (can't quite remember!) until January 1998 when Season Two premiered. And boy, was it worth it. Every. Single. Second. Why do you ask? Because a show hooked up its two leads in the season 2 premiere. One of the fastest hookups and extremely daring for a cable show airing on USA Network. Producers pushed the envelope of 'decency' and showed a completely nude scene for the first time (I believe) on BASIC cable. Fans nation- (and eventually world-) wide were shocked, awed, and delighted. Quite frankly we got a nice view of Michael's behind. And a beautifully rendered love scene.And then they took it all back with the next several episodes. Season two sees Michael and Nikita together in the premiere, and then see-sawing back and forth between love and loathing for the next 21 episodes. It has some amazing character-building episodes: Hard Landing, Not Was, Psychic Pilgrim, and Half-Life to mention a few.Caution to newbies: Season 2, and every other season in the series, ends on a cliff-hanger. And at least you don't have to wait four to six months to get your fix. So I'd advise, if you're an addict...to buy all the seasons at once.
