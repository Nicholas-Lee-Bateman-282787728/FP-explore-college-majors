This is just a good movie about people who are not afraid to try and do something even though they are pretty sure that there is nothing they will be able to accomplish. This is a movie that is very believable. I could actually see someone doing this if they were about to lose their jobs.

The railroad is being reorganized and the small town he lives in will be devastated so some rich folks in Chicago can roll in more ""dough"". He and another worker take a locomotive to Chicago to try and convince the ""powers that be"" to think twice about the reorganization. Instead the company clones try to use them in an advertising campaign to make the changes go smoother.  Brimley won't have it.  You watch the rest.  You have the sad and inevitable conflict of young and old, rich and poor played out in the heartland.
