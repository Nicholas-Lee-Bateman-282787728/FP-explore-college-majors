This film is powerful addition to that ouvre.The film is set at the same time as the French Connection and indeed it focusses on the same unit depicted in that film. However where Friedkin, the director of The French Connection, focussed on car chases and glorifying police power and summary executions this movie deals with the uncomfortable fact that the unit was one of the most corrupt in NYPD history.And yet, the film avoids caractures and simple explanations. The cops are still decent and likable people despite their excesses and hence the difficulty of the central character's decision to expose them is never shirked. Justice when it comes is a sad thing with no fanfare and often with tragic consequences.In some respects this film might be seen as a precursor to ""The Wire"", where tension and entertainment are derived from the dilemmas of the characters and the painstaking detail of the investigation and the subsequent court cases rather than from action set pieces.A gripping, rarely remembered meditation on policing, corruption and the price of redemption from one of the all time great directors.",5,The flipside of the French Connection,1324425600,"12 21, 2011",2011,1193,"['recurrent', 'feature', 'Lumet', 'work', 'been', 'policing', 'police', 'corruption', 'film', 'powerful', 'addition', 'ouvre.The', 'film', 'set', 'same', 'time', 'French', 'Connection', 'indeed', 'same', 'unit', 'depicted', 'film', 'However', 'where', 'Friedkin', 'director', 'French', 'Connection', 'focussed', 'car', 'chases', 'glorifying', 'police', 'power', 'summary', 'executions', 'movie', 'uncomfortable', 'fact', 'unit', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'corrupt', 'NYPD', 'history.And', 'yet', 'film', 'avoids', 'caractures', 'simple', 'explanations', 'cops', 'are', 'still', 'decent', 'likable', 'people', 'excesses', 'hence', 'difficulty', 'central', 'character', 'decision', 'expose', 'never', 'shirked', 'Justice', 'when', 'sad', 'thing', 'fanfare', 'often', 'tragic', 'consequences.In', 'respects', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'precursor', 'Wire', 'where', 'tension', 'entertainment', 'are', 'derived', 'dilemmas', 'characters', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'investigation', 'subsequent', 'court', 'cases', 'rather', 'action', 'set', 'pieces.A', 'gripping', 'rarely', 'remembered', 'meditation', 'policing', 'corruption', 'price', 'redemption', 'one', 'time', 'great', 'directors']",Prince of the City VHS

I've talked to ex-cops and they all cite this movie as being the most accurate in showing NYPD culture as it was and is today. Treat Williams along with the rest of the ensemble cast give truly amazing performances that has to be seen to be believed.

However, it is one of the best he has done, and it is even an improved version on police corruption over Serpico, of course a classic picture that will remain unforgettable. Treat Williams, a player I normally dismiss due to weak acting skills, is a tour de force in Prince of the City, and just like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas, is the biggest reason why the film was compelling to watch from start to finish. It didn't matter to me if the film was over three hours long; it is Treat Williams who goes apesht every second of the reel and make the film to work for me. In fact, I am surprised that he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. That was a great, mesmerizing performance if I ever saw one. Treat Williams' career fizzled out when it was revealed that he had a cocaine problem. On the other hand, the writing is incredible, and the complexity of the film is also amazing. I surely will revisit Prince of the City another time because it was a complete treat for me to see. All in all, because of Treat Williams' performance and the writing, Prince of the City is one of the best movies I've seen.",5,Treat Williams Got Robbed of an Oscar.,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,1279,"['Viewed', '3/12Rate', '103/12', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'call', 'Prince', 'City', 'be', 'very', 'best', 'picture', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'ever', 'directed', 'distinction', 'will', 'go', 'Network', 'However', 'one', 'best', 'done', 'even', 'improved', 'version', 'police', 'corruption', 'Serpico', 'course', 'classic', 'picture', 'will', 'remain', 'unforgettable', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'player', 'normally', 'dismiss', 'due', 'weak', 'acting', 'skills', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'Prince', 'City', 'just', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Goodfellas', 'biggest', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'compelling', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'film', 'was', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'who', 'apesht', 'second', 'reel', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'fact', 'am', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'was', 'great', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'ever', 'saw', 'one', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'career', 'fizzled', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'revealed', 'had', 'cocaine', 'problem', 'other', 'hand', 'writing', 'incredible', 'complexity', 'film', 'also', 'amazing', 'surely', 'will', 'revisit', 'Prince', 'City', 'time', 'was', 'complete', 'treat', 'see', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'performance', 'writing', 'Prince', 'City', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen']",Prince of the City VHS

238760,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,630027182X,Buenoslibros.es,"[22, 22]","Almost 3 hours long and worth every minute. As great a cops and mafia film as there are, even comparable to the Godfather saga (I & II). Danny Ciello is a policeman hero, though technically he may be a criminal. These kind of police are the only people that stand between the comfortable beaurocracy class of lawyers and politicians and the jungle of drugadicts and all sorts of criminals. They do the dirty job the talkers won't do but appreciate as long as they themselves don't get caught (anything comparable to Plato's Republic, maybe?)The question the film poses to the audience is: Do you approve -or not- this kind of police behavior? I say that the law was made for man, and not the other way round. We mustn't miss the aim of the law, lest we get entangled in our own web and become pharisaic.This is another great Sidney Lumet classic, beautiful and entertaining; it makes you think over and over again about the issues exposed here. It has a great script. The leading actor does superbly. Directed talentedly, detachedly, not too overdramatic.The thing I like about Lumet's films (the best director in the second half of the 20th century) is that he talks about human nature. His films are not just stories, things that happen as part of a plot. They are little revelations of the human soul. They talk about who more than what. And it's whom we really care for, isn't it? The issues are eternal: love, friendship, faithfulness, resilience, repentence, redemption... everything that separates us from animals, and everything is put to the test, the test of real life situations: where the rubber meets the road (as the great Christian Vernon McGee would say).A classic but also a great modern film.

Greene ""davidgreene52movie devotee""","[3, 3]","If you are a follower of director, Sidney Lumet's films over the last few decades, you know how absorbed he seems to be with matters of police and government corruption.  Mostly based in his hometown, New York, these movies reflect a profound familiarity with his subject matter that lends an amazing feeling of authenticity to each one.  The other common characteristic of a Lumet film is his fabulous ability to elicit powerful performances from his casts.  Trear Williams, for no known reason, never seems to achieve the level of stardom that an attractive and monumentally talented artist such as he is rightly deserves.  He may never have been better than he is in this meaty starring role.  The supporting players all seem to be in equally fine form.  The film is long and, although it has some lively moments, should not be confused with the typical thrill-a-minute police action show.

238762,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,630027182X,David Baldwin,"[11, 11]","About ten years ago, I picked up a paperback of Robert Daley's ""Prince of the City"".  I found Daley's account of corruption in the ranks of the New York City Police Department and the Knapp Commision hearings mesmerizing.  This led me to Peter Maas' ""Serpico"".  Naturally I hunted down the two films that director Sidney Lumet based on these books.  As much as I liked ""Serpico"" I found ""Prince of the City"" a much more compelling story.  I think this has more to do with the fact that Danny Ciello(Bob Leuci in the book) is a much more enigmatic figure than Frank Serpico.  Serpico was a maverick but there was no questioning his integrity.  Ciello's motives for blowing the whistle are a little more problematic.  As a high profile narcotics detective, Ciello took bribes from organized crime figures and provided his stoolies with drugs among his many sundry offences.  Now you can say that a lot of what Ciello did were necessary evils in conducting his day to day affairs but he also feathered his own personal nest.  When he decides to go clean with the Commision he wants to do it on his own terms, meaning he'll bring down people he has a personal distaste for but not his friends on the force or his partners.  Ciello's handlers have a different agenda, however, that doesn't naturally cohere with his.  ""Prince of the City"" is a long film but it never sags.  Aside from Lumet's crisp direction he also has crafted an engrossingly complex script with Jay Presson Allen.  Treat Williams as Ciello gives a wrenching account of a man in turmoil.  This is the kind of performance that gets overlooked probably because Ciello is a morally ambiguous figure.

It richly deserved the awards it never received.  Lifted straight from the book with only minor name changes, Prince of the City was a compelling look into the world of a narcotics detective as he brings about his unit's downfall.  Danny Cielo (Treat Williams) is the cop who belatedly develops a conscience and rebels against what he and his men have become in their war on drugs; they've corrupted themselves to nail the corrupt and maintain their fantastically high arrest and conviction rate.At first, Cielo has no intention of turning in his unit.  He actually tries only to go after the criminals.  However, in making a deal with the feds he's made a deal with the devil.  The prosecutors realize they have a gold mine in Cielo and dig into him for all the information they can obtain.  Little by little, the circle tightens like a noose around Cielo until he ends up fingering his mentor, then his own men.  For a cop to rat on fellow cops is a deeply imprinted anamoly, an affront to the brotherhood that binds the police more tightly than blood ties.  Cielo disintegrates under the pressure and agonies of his betrayals, shaking and crying, popping Valium to alleviate his tortured guilt.  Around him, his men rat each other out and one even commits suicide.  Only one is strong enough to withstand the feds:  Gus Levy (Jerry Orbach), who marches into the office of a weasely prosecutor to tip his desk onto him and offers to toss him through the window of his high-rise building.  At the end, Levy despises Cielo for his decision, and though Danny has done the right thing in the eyes of the law, he suffers as a pariah in the view of some of his fellow police officers.This is a great piece of cinema.  The direction is tight, the acting fantastic, and the dialogue heavily laced with coarse language that deepens the realism.  Treat Williams never again received a role or acted so well as he did in this film.  Jerry Orbach was so immersed in his part that Dick Wolf wanted him as a detective on Law & Order after seeing him portray Gus Levy.  Sidney Lumet sculpted this movie into an intense drama that, while long, is never boring.  Done by Lumet as an apology for his hatchet job on the NYPD in Serpico, this film succeeds in more ways than mere atonement; it is brilliant in its own right and ends more ambiguously, letting the viewer sort out who did the right thing.

Lumet and Jay Presson Allen have written such a complex yet great script that at times you wish it got the more cinematic dimensions that Scorsese could bring to it as opposed to Lumet's dramatic but austere approach.  In the docs here he discusses his ambivalence towards the main character and you get that watching the film.  He's never given the point of view allowed to Pacino's Serpico or Paul Newman's Frank Galvin.  As a result Treat Williams is all over the place.  He's great in some scenes and in other he's just too much.  (There's even an odd bit where he seems to be doing a Steve Martin imitation.)

It is terrifically cast, with Treat Williams creating a role of real-life Detective Robert Leuci.  Backing him are Jerry Orbach as his partner, the quintessential New York cop.

As others have mentioned it is almost 3 hours long which requires undivided attention from viewers because of the number of characters & the plot.I remember seeing this movie as a tween & then and now am always riveted by the performance of Treat Williams as the conflicted young detective, Daniel Ciello.  As the youngest member of a rogue plain clothed detective unit, Ciello becomes troubled by the acts of corruption he has participated in with the group and once called in to talk with investigators of the Chase Commission he can no longer deal with his conflicted feelings between what he ""should"" be doing as a cop vs what he was actually doing and so begins to out corrupt lawyers, bail bondsmen, etc.  He vows not to bring down other cops or his partners.Although Ciello doesn't intend to get himself or his partners ""caught up"" in the investigation (initially admitting to only having committed 3 illegal acts), the relentless pursuit of corruption within the entire system ultimately forces him to reveal his deeds & betray his partners.  This confession ultimately causes his rabbi & a partner to commit suicide and causes the death of his mobbed up cousin.Treat Williams portrayal of at first a swaggering cop to a broken, guilt-ridden man is riveting.  Other actors who stood out to me are of course, the always wonderful - Jerry Orbach as Gus Levy one of Ciello's partners; Lane Smith as Tug, one of the FBI agents assigned to protect Ciello & his family and Carmine Caridi as the doomed Gino Mascone.  I was surprised to discover that Treat Williams nor Jerry Orbach were nominated for oscars.This is one of those films that I enjoy watching once or twice per year because of the compelling story & performances.

Perhaps, ""entertaining"" was not the cheif objective here.  A lot of work went into it obviously, and I could appreciate that, though at times the movie was kind of a frustrating ordeal, not only for the main character but for me as well.  It was hard to really feel his need for redemption to begin with. We know he's somewhat on the take, in the beginning, but we're not really brought to the point of feeling the anguish that brings him to want to turn informant.  This happens soon after the movie begins and we're left reeling in the next two plus hours with his decision.  Really, we are given a few brief incidents (he helps a junkie get smack, and his own brother accuses him of too lavish a lifestyle) - then bam - he wants to talk to the D.A.Through endless court indictments and the eventual revealing of his own misdeeds, we learn about some of the things which may have brought New York cop, Danny Ciello, to the point of wanting to turn informant (though by that point in the movie he's probably regretting having done so).  But telling is one thing.  Showing is another.  I'd have sympathized more with his whole struggle if I'd been SHOWN stronger reason in the beginning for his wanting to turn, which in the eyes of his colleagues, and even the viewers at times, seems like a weak betrayal - perhaps a character problem rather than an issue of conscience.As an idea, the dilemma is readily apparent (between what he and indeed the whole legal system deem is right, and the practical realities of the street).  Prince of the City is the study of a man who makes an incredibly daring decision and the aftermath that follows.

238775,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,630027182X,Mr. Cairene,"[37, 39]","There once was a kingdom ruled over by a fair and righteous king. One day, an evil witch descended upon the well from which the people drank, and poisoned the water. The very next day everyone but the righteous king drank the poisoned water. And they all went insane. All but the king that is. For several days after, the people wondered aloud, ""What happened to our king,"" they shouted in the streets, ""Has he gone insane?"" So the king went and drank from the poisoned water, and everything was well again.That is the story Al Pacino's girlfriend tells him late in ""Serpico"", Sidney Lumet's celebrated 1973 true-life tale about police corruption and one's man's obstinate stand against it. Apart from Pacino's performance as Frank Serpico, that film was a compromised moral drama, thrown haphazardly together to fit a commercial running time. The success of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (1975) and ""Network"" (1976) then allowed Lumet to make Prince of The City, unquestionably his greatest work, and worthy of the story of the king. As a piece of narrative it ignores all the established rules: There are no acts (first, second or third). There are no heroes, and no villains. There are no gun battles or showdowns. This, for its entire three hour running time, is an account of a cop who decides to blow the whistle on corruption, and the legal repercussions that ensue. Unlike Serpico, Det. Daniel Ciello (Treat Williams) is no saint. He does what, in his view, needs to be done. And given the nature of power, a lot more. On his own accord, he heads to the Chase commission, where he decides to ""do the right thing"", and confess. His one condition? He won't rat on his partners. He knows them to be good men. We see them at his luxurious two-story house. They are cordial, pleasant, brotherly. When he states his condition to the government lawyers, he says, ""I sleep with my wife. But I live with my partners.""Except the forces that be don't see things the way he does. Ciello and his partners are the Special Investigative Unit for Narcotics, the ""Princes of the city"". They have citywide jurisdiction and are virtually unsupervised. When they make a bust they A) Keep the drug dealer's money. B) Sell the drug dealer his freedom. Or C) Arrest him and take his money. They have reasons too. You see, a drug dealer without money would never be able to buy another cop, a DA or a judge. And if they don't have enough evidence to convict anyway, they may as well have the money. This group of cops, as they have no doubt explained to themselves, tens if not hundreds of times, have a moral right to scam the dealers. They have a moral imperative to keep their junkie stoolies (snitches) supplied with Heroin. Yes they do this for the information, but also because, ""a junkie will break your heart."" The practice of giving Heroin, according to the government lawyers, is exactly the same as dealing. Legally, they are as culpable as drug dealers. And the moral haze thickens.No one joins the police force to become a bad guy. That is why Lumet, whose films are basically about the subjectivity of right and wrong, is fascinated with cops. They are not gangsters, who, as depicted in Scorsese's Goodfellas, are more about the money and ""the life"" than a mythical code of honor. For cops (even those who beat protestors or torture prisoners around the world) there has been, in most cases, a point where they justified their actions. In Prince of The City, Lumet affords all his characters, including the tens of government lawyers, an unfeigned authenticity that makes every scene in the film riveting. For every odious act performed against, or by a cop (or even a lawyer), there's an underlying moral position. The moral complexity of Lumet's best work lies in the assumption that pure evil does not exist.What sets Prince of the City apart (and what earns it comparisons to the films of Martin Scorsese) is the unusual strength of its characters. Lumet, who co-wrote the screenplay, something he does not do often, employs a strangely effective technique. Instead of a narration, there are regular grim stills of the ID Cards of the characters involved accompanied by quotations such as ""nobody cares about you but your partners"", and ""I'll be telling lies for the rest of my life"". The whole film then takes a feel of a postmortem documentary. The stills are there because the characters involved, probably for calamitous reasons, need to be identified. The quotations are the leads character's regrets. And as Ciello, Treat Williams gives a forceful performance that requires him to be in every scene.

238780,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,630027182X,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 7]","""Prince of the City,"" (1981), is a dramatic thriller that is actually set in the 1970s in New York City.  It's based on a non-fiction book by former New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Robert Daley, and tells the tale of the Knapp Commission, headed up by Judge Whitman Knapp, that was investigating police corruption at the time, and of Detective Bob Leucci (called Dan Ciello in the movie), whose conscience eventually forced him to cooperate with it.  The Daley book was adapted for the screen by Sidney Lumet, always a great director of New York City-based stories, working with his frequent collaborator, Jay Presson Allen; Lumet also directed, some say as an apology to the NYPD for how negatively he had treated them in his previous film on the same subject,Serpico (Widescreen Edition), that starred Al Pacino as the beleaguered cop trying to come clean.To begin with, ""Prince,"" is both long - the director's cut requires two DVD's, and slow, with very little overt action, or violence.  Treat Williams turns in one of his strongest performances as the title character, Danny Ciello, a NYC police detective in the Special Investigations Unit, in which, at the time, its plain clothes members were given such freedom of action as to earn the nickname ""Princes of the City.""  He and the men in his unit work in narcotics, and are enriching themselves quite nicely: they are suspected, among other misdeeds, of having stolen, and peddled at a profit, the huge haul of drugs resulting from the famous French Connection case.  (SeeThe French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy, book by Robin Moore, or the movieThe French Connectionof the same name.)  Ciello's conscience has been bothering him, and he comes forward to aid commission staffers make their cases, and to testify for them.  But somehow, he had imagined he could control the investigation once he started it: that he could keep it away from himself, his partners, and his friends, and, of course, he was not able to do that - two of his friends on the force end up eating their guns.The talented actress Lindsay Crouse, (House of Games) daughter of theater royalty, plays Ciello's wife, Carla.  Bob Balaban (Men in Black & Close Encounters (2pc) [VHS]) plays Santimassino, a conviction-hungry federal prosecutor.  A very young Cynthia Nixon (Sex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)) plays Jeannie, a young drug addict.  Jerry Ohrbach (Law & Order: The Seventh Year), plays fellow cop Gus Levy, and runs away with the movie: Dick Wolf cast him in that show on the strength of his performance here.  I must say, though, that the film is, to my mind, weakened by many casting errors.  Brian De Palma was originally set to direct, and would have starred Robert De Niro in the title role.  That's casting that would have worked better.  Williams acts very well with his face and eyes, but has a high, soft, almost feminine voice, and throws out some odd vibes for a cop.  Lindsay Crouse is certainly talented, but she was not the girl to play an ethnic NY cop's wife.  An important black part, ""the King,"" was played most forgettably by an actor unknown to me: and this at a time when Samuel L. Jackson and Denzel Washington had already begun working, and were likely available, and Don Cheadle and Wesley Snipes may also have already begun working.  There are parts for a couple of Hispanic actors, as Ciello's drug-addicted informers: they too are played by forgettable actors, when Luis Guzman was already working, and it's not easy to forget Luis Guzman.  Most peculiarly of all, there are many parts for Italians/wise guys, and those too are played by easily forgettable actors, whereas anybody who's seen The Sopranos: The Complete Series knows that the New York area is loaded with Italian character actors who can carry their weight.What Lumet did get right, however, was the zeitgeist of the city in the 1970s.  It was dirty, covered with graffiti, and overrun with drug addicts, and drug-related crime.  What he didn't get right was the fact that this was all about to change very shortly.  1981 actually saw the birth of the AIDS epidemic in New York.  Before very long, all these needle-sharing addicts were to fall victim to the disease, in a phenomenon some cops called ""the self-cleaning oven."" Unfortunately, many of their significant others, and their children were also to become fatally diseased.  But, one way or another, the AIDS plague wiped out the drug plague, and with it, most of the drug-related crime that had so plagued the city.  At any rate, the movie stands as a record of life in 1970s New York.  If you are interested in the subject matter, it might be worth a look.",3,A Record of Life in 1970s New York City,1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,4733,"['Prince', 'City', '1981', 'dramatic', 'thriller',

238783,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,630027182X,Westley,"[12, 21]","""Prince of the City"" (1981) stars Treat Williams as Daniel Ciello, a corrupt NYC cop who heads the narcotics division.  Ciello and his crew routinely confiscate narcotics from various drug dealers to sell for a profit.  They also funnel some of the drugs to their junkie informants.  The cops in the division are like an extended family, and they've built very comfortable lives for themselves.  One night, Ciello finds himself cruising the streets looking for drugs for one of his snitches.  After beating up a small-time dealer, Ciello has an epiphany about how corrupt he's become; so, he sets up a meeting with the head of an internal investigation.  He provides evidence against a number of cops and does additional undercover work to help nail some others.Directed by Sidney Lumet and based on a true story, ""Prince of the City"" is quite good in many ways.  It has a fairly realistic tone, somewhere between the grittiness of Lumet's classic 1970s cop films (Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico) and the more polished NYC cop stories we've become accustomed to on TV (Law and Order).  Many scenes take place in small NYC neighborhoods - the movie just has a nice feel to it.  The acting is also good, with some terrific character actors filling in key roles, particularly Jerry Orbach.  The story is also inherently interesting, with a nicely written script which was Oscar nominated.  I especially liked the manner in which Treat Williams character is the protagonist but also so morally ambiguous.Despite all of these strengths, ""Prince of the City"" ends up being a somewhat middling movie.  Why?  Overlength.  At 167 minutes, the film could have easily had an hour trimmed.  Too many details are presented, which ends up confusing the plot and dulling the impact of the story.  Clearly, Lumet intended the film to be epic in nature, but it doesn't have the gavitas to sustain such a long running time.  Also, the movie shows surprisingly little about how this situation affects Ciello's family; they move several times and are under constant police protection, but aside from a few scenes with his wife (Lindsay Crouse), this subplot is virtually ignored.  I really wanted to like this film much more than I did.  Nevertheless, it's not without merit and fans of cop dramas will likely enjoy it.
