Most people are familiar with the 1944 American Version starring Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer & the screen debut of Angela Lansbury.Released in 1940 starring Anton Walbrook & Diane Wynyard this was as classic a tale then as it is now. I prefer it slightly over the American version as the storyline is a darker more abusive affair than America's. By the way Walbrook & Wynyard were big stars then & the acting is best in the British version.The story begins with a cruel & foul murder of an old woman knitting in her home. Young love causes a new bride to bring the husband she loves so dearly back to the house her murdered aunt had left to her years ago. No one had been willing to rent the place because of the evil crime. It stood empty & decaying for years despite it's location in Covent Gardens a very desirable location in London. The police had always been suspicious of the extensive damage done to the house & furnishings during the night of the murder & thought the old ladies rubies had disappeared with the killer.In this show it's all about the relationship of wife, husband, maid & the gems. Not to mention the old retired detective who remembered the case from back when & thought he recognized the wife's husband. A 5 star tale & well worth buying if you like your characters dark in a murder story. The disc I got had this 1940 version on 1 side & the 1944 American version on the other. Two worlds- One price.

Yes, in order to have a monopoly on the flashier, star-filled version of Gaslight it was releasing in 1944, MGM attempted to purchase all existing film of this quietly superior 1940 motion picture and destroy them. Thankfully MGM failed and we have this excellent classic today. Telling the tale of a Victorian murderer's sadistic efforts to convince his frail spouse that she is going insane, Gaslight sets the standard for psychological thriller. Even its very name is shorthand for someone attempting to wreck someone's mind and undermine his or her self-confidence, as in, ""Gee, she totally Gaslighted me about that whole pregnancy thing.""

1014526,A2DZ6ZZBVW857S,B000HEWEUS,Doc Holliday,"[39, 40]","After seeing Anton Walbrook in ""49th Parallel"" (1941), ""The Life and Times of Colonel Blimp"" (1943), ""Red Shoes"" (1948), I am definitely a Walbrook fan.  His acting is skilled and magical.  This amazing talent was clearly borne out in the 1940 British version of ""Gaslight"", which I believe to be vastly superior to the slick, Hollywood remake in 1944 with Boyer and Bergman.  Overall, Walbrook's performance is just more psychologically correct as the consummate narcissistic, evil killer, who brings his wife, played by Diana Wynyard, repeatedly up, then down with surprising dramatic intensity, in his relentless plan to drive her mad.  In the Hollywood remake, I can never quite believe that Bergman's overdone beauty is even physically suited to the role of a victimized, Victorian female, in fact, she seems like she could knock Boyer out, at any time.  Not surprisingly, the British version clearly portrays the Victorian social of dominance of men, and in particular, husbands who could have their spouses involuntarily committed to an asylum, simply by summoning a doctor.  The painful reality of female status and vulnerability in Victorian England was also sensationally portrayed in the plots of novels like ""Jane Eyre"" by Bronte, ""The Woman in White"" by Wilkie Collins, ""Lady Audley's Secret"" by Mary Elizabeth Braddon, (all of which I highly recommend).  Someday, I hope the 1940 British version of ""Gaslight"" with Walbrook will be restored or remastered to the best optical and sound quality possible.

1014528,A106016KSI0YQ,B000HEWEUS,Jay Dickson,"[1, 1]","MGM reportedly tried to buy up all the copies of this film, the first cinematic adaptation of Patrick Hamilton's famous stage melodrama of the same name, so as to destroy them when they released their own version directed by George Cukor (and starring Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman, in her first Oscar-winning turn). As a result, over the years the conventional wisdom was that this version, directed by Thorold Dickinson and starring Anton Walbrook as the murderous Paul Mallen and Diana Wyngard as his terrorized wife bella, was far superior (an idea especially promoted by the British film critic Leslie Halliwell). It's a terrific adaptation, but it's not necessarily better than the Cukor version--it's just different. With a smaller budget, Dickinson crafted a much more accurate and absorbing visual design for the film, and the London town house of the central couple (called the Antons in the MGM remake) much more accurately reflects the kind of house a nouveau riche man like the central anti-hero would buy and furnish in late Victorian London; moreover, Dickinson's use of his camera and of mise-en-scene is absolutely superior to Cukor's. But the acting in the Hollywood version is ultimately preferable. Although Ingrid Bergman was hampered by her (unremarked) Swedish accent and her physical healthiness (not entirely appropriate to the famously frail heroine, driven slowly insane by her husband's cruel tricks), she is much more viscerally affecting--particularly in the famous evening musicale scene--than the more delicate and properly British Diana Wyngard is here. (Even so, Wyngard brings some terrific ambiguity to her final big scene confronting her husband.) Anton Walbrook overplays his hand here as the sadistic psychopath trying to drive his wife into the insane asylum, and Catherine Cordell here just cannot compare with Angela Lansbury as the insolent and flirtatious servant girl. But this film's inventiveness and attention to realistic period detail make it equally good, and more than worth seeing.",4,"Great, though not as superior to the Cukor version as often said",1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,2037,"['MGM', 'reportedly', 'tried', 'buy', 'up', 'copies', 'film', 'first', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'Patrick', 'Hamilton', 'famous', 'stage', 'melodrama', 'same', 'name', 'so', 'destroy', 'when', 'released', 'own', 'version', 'directed', 'George', 'Cukor', 'starring', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'first', 'Oscar-winning', 'turn', 'result', 'years', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'was', 'version', 'directed', 'Thorold', 'Dickinson', 'starring', 'Anton', 'Walbrook', 'murderous', 'Paul', 'Mallen', 'Diana', 'Wyngard', 'terrorized', 'wife', 'bella', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'idea', 'especially', 'promoted', 'British', 'film', 'critic', 'Leslie', 'Halliwell', 'terrific', 'adaptation', 'not', 'necessarily', 'better', 'Cukor', 'version', 'just', 'different', 'smaller', 'budget', 'Dickinson', 'crafted', 'much', 'more', 'accurate', 'absorbing', 'visual', 'design', 'film', 'London', 'town', 'house', 'central', 'couple', 'called', 'Antons', 'MGM', 'remake', 'much', 'more', 'accurately', 'kind', 'house', 'nouveau', 'riche', 'man', 'central', 'anti-hero', 'would', 'buy', 'furnish', 'late', 'Victorian', 'London', 'moreover', 'Dickinson', 'use', 'camera', 'mise-en-scene', 'absolutely', 'superior', 'Cukor', 'acting', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'ultimately', 'preferable', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'was', 'hampered', 'unremarked', 'Swedish', 'accent', 'physical', 'healthiness', 'not', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'famously', 'frail', 'heroine', 'driven', 'slowly', 'insane', 'husband', 'cruel', 'tricks', 'much', 'more', 'viscerally', 'affecting', 'particularly', 'famous', 'evening', 'musicale', 'scene', 'more', 'delicate', 'properly', 'British', 'Diana', 'Wyngard', 'here', 'Even', 'so', 'Wyngard', 'terrific', 'ambiguity', 'final', 'big', 'scene', 'confronting', 'husband', 'Anton', 'Walbrook', 'hand', 'here', 'sadistic', 'psychopath', 'trying', 'drive', 'wife', 'insane', 'asylum', 'Catherine', 'Cordell', 'here', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'insolent', 'flirtatious', 'servant', 'girl', 'film', 'inventiveness', 'attention', 'realistic', 'period', 'detail', 'make', 'equally', 'good', 'more', 'worth', 'seeing']",Gaslight

1014534,A3E8Y4OW8IFFDX,B000HEWEUS,S. P. Miskowski,"[6, 6]","Patrick Hamilton, British author of Hangover Square, wrote the play Gas Light in 1938. Produced on stage in the U.S. as Angel Street, the script has been adapted for the screen twice: by A.R. Rawlinson and later by John van Druten.* The first version is directed by Thorold Dickinson, the second by George Cukor.The 1944 Gaslight starring Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman (who won her first Academy Award for her role) is the better known of the two films. But the 1940 British version is worth watching for nuanced and subtle performances, and for plot variations that arguably surpass the classic Hollywood adaptation.If you're a fan of psychological suspense and intelligent acting, sans blood and physical torture, it doesn't get much better than this. For extra fun, check out both versions of Gaslight and screen a double feature.Minor Spoilers FollowSet in Victorian London, Gaslight opens with the murder of elderly Alice Barlow. The scene is brutal, although no blood is shown. At one point the killer, whose face we do not see, lifts the victim's body just enough to shove her aside during a frantic search for valuables. When the scene ends, the camera pulls back to show us every piece of furniture has been gutted or broken. The Barlow home lies in ruins, and a newspaper article informs us that the family's priceless collection of rubies is missing.Years pass while the house remains unoccupied, presumably due to its violent and scandalous history. But eventually a couple takes over the property and begins renovations. These include blocking off the top floor and acquiring an adjacent house, which they refuse to rent or sell.As soon as we meet this couple, Paul and Bella Mallen, we sense something is wrong. Paul (Anton Walbrook) is tense and terse, gentlemanly in appearance yet not refined in his manner. Bella (Diana Wynyard) appears to suffer from an undefined nervous disorder. Above all they seem unhappy and uneasy with one another.We quickly move from unease to something much more sinister. We discover that Paul likes to play games with Bella. These include:* Hiding precious objects and then pretending that she is the culprit.* Making her break down in front of neighbors at social events.* Turning household servants against her by insinuating that she suspects them of stealing.* Keeping her from her family so that she has no outside reality check.* Telling her that her lack of memory about stealing indicates that she is going mad.The innocent are often at the mercy of those more cunning and selfish by nature. Gaslight perfectly captures how this grim reality plays out in an unhappy marriage, especially if one spouse is favored by the laws and customs of the time. Paul has practical reasons for driving his wife to the brink of insanity, but the creepiness of the drama lies in its continuous indication that he derives deep personal pleasure from his control and abuse of his loving wife.If you're a fan of the 1944 Gaslight, you will notice significant differences early on. For example: In the scenes following the murder we travel to Europe for a romantic interlude. We see Ingrid Bergman, as the young niece of the murder victim, whisked away to Italy to follow in her aunt's footsteps by studying opera. In the 1940 version Barlow is not an opera singer.Now that I've seen the earlier film, I realize that this European adventure--in which the niece falls madly in love with the man who accompanies her on piano at school--is pure Hollywood fluff. Cukor was all about fluff when it came to his leading ladies, and this completely unnecessary side trip gave Bergman a chance to show more emotional range than the original script allowed. We can see her as a girl--an overgrown girl, to say the least--swept off her feet by her accompanist (Charles Boyer) and giving up a bright future in opera to marry him. Once you examine it closely, the premise seems ludicrous.The British Gaslight emphasizes plot, while the Hollywood Gaslight is a showcase for the luminous beauty and grace of Ingrid Bergman. This explains why her role has been expanded.Previously, the elderly Barlow had only one living relative: a nephew, who disappeared after the murder. When this nephew is recognized years later by a former police officer who decides to find out why Louis Bauer has returned to his aunt's residence with a new name and a wife who is clearly a nervous wreck, we are drawn inexorably into the heart of the mystery.Even the longest arm of coincidence can't make it plausible that a criminal would stalk young Bergman all the way to music school in another country, and then weasel his way into a job as a piano player so that he could seduce her. In other words, Charles Boyer's role has been both diminished and distorted to make more room for Bergman. Which brings me to another bit of implausibility.At several points in the British Gaslight the husband seems physically menacing. It is obvious in this Victorian household that the man is capable of violence against his wife. She shrinks from him because he might actually harm her. The threat of assault is real, and it adds to the fragile wife's confusion and distress.In the more famous incarnation, no matter how many times Bergman cowers and cringes from her cruel husband, we don't see a sense of real physical danger. This is about casting. In a knockdown, drag-out brawl the hearty Bergman could easily overtake the fastidious Boyer, and this makes the imbalance of their relationship seem odd rather than scary.Further distortions include the characterization of the sleuth, who decides to solve the mystery. In the original film, this intrepid former policeman is called B.G. Rough and he's played by Frank Pettingell, an engaging fellow who is more Charles Laughton than Joseph Cotten.Cukor's decision to cast Cotten opposite Bergman allowed her character the possibility of a romantic alternative to Boyer. Pettingell is terrific, but his interest in the manipulated young wife is more paternal than romantic. Again, the Hollywood alteration draws attention from the story and places the wife's emotional life center stage.I won't reveal what has happened to the Barlow rubies, because this part of the plot is ingenious. The subsequent adaptation is clumsy by comparison.As a fan of black and white Hollywood glamor I find the 1944 film irreplaceable. As a writer who has dabbled in the dramatic arts, I am appalled by the concessions made to vanity. But Cukor was a master at showcasing beautiful actresses, van Druten had a long and distinguished career (with credits ranging from Bell, Book and Candle to Cabaret) and Bergman won an Oscar. So what do I know?*There are also two TV versions of the story and, of course, Gaslight has inspired countless other films and TV movies, and engendered a particular term for the kind of psychological abuse it portrays, known as ""gaslighting.""",4,The First Film Version of Gaslight,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,6895,"['Patrick', 'Hamilton', 'British', 'author', 'Hangover', 'Square', 'wrote',

1014535,A1AN4ZZ43SKLOE,B000HEWEUS,Spooxster,"[0, 0]","Gaslight (1940 UK version)  I try not to research a movie before I see it so I enter with minimal preconceptions.  As I watched TV some 20 years ago, ""Gaslight"" was referenced by Lucille Ball on an episode of her show ""I Love Lucy"", and I have been meaning to view this movie ever since.  I had no idea there were 2 versions of the film and started watching the first movie with the title that reflected the appropriate year.  The UK original is the version I ended up seeing and so this review is for that version only.The start of this suspense film feels a little jerky, but then you realize that you are thrown into a situation that has already been going on for quite some time and the feeling of a hiccup-start fades away rapidly, giving open air for what is to come.  In a smart move, you aren't totally clued in to the antagonist's motive for doing what he is doing to his wife, even with the surprisingly violent prologue included.  Instead, you get to helplessly watch as he continues to torture and destroy her psyche in the protracted, devilish way he does.The leads played by Mr. Walbrook and Ms. Wynyard are totally compelling and believable, accompanied by plausible performances from the supporting cast.  Anton Walbrook plays his character with such a hardened determinism that by the time of the big reveal at the end, you may even catch yourself trying to will a certain pointy object a bit further.  At first you may find Diana Wynyard a bit flakey, but as you see what has been and is being done to her character, you cannot imagine how else she would act.  You just have to keep in mind that the story is taking place late 19th century, when a lot of these actions and responses were the status quo.  As far as the ending goes, you may wish for more to come of things, but it all comes around to showing how pure her heart is and makes all that has come before that much more poignant.  It has been a long time since I felt so strongly about an antagonist.  Well done, Anton!Gaslight's main course is suspense, with a side of mystery.  Add in a small sprinkle of detective story and a perfect dash of heart and in the end the movie serves up an excellent, well-rounded experience that demands to at least be sampled to see if it whets your appetite.Within the next week I will be watching the 1944 American version, and will update this review accordingly.",5,"I'd swear I left this review right there, on the desk.....(Minor Spolers)",1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,2378,"['Gaslight', '1940', 'UK', 'version', 'try', 'not', 'research', 'movie', 'see', 'so', 'enter', 'minimal', 'preconceptions', 'watched', 'TV', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Gaslight', 'was', 'referenced', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'episode', 'show', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'have', 'been', 'meaning', 'view', 'movie', 'ever', 'had', 'idea', 'there', 'were', '2', 'versions', 'film', 'started', 'watching', 'first', 'movie', 'title', 'reflected', 'appropriate', 'year', 'UK', 'original', 'version', 'ended', 'up', 'seeing', 'so', 'review', 'version', 'start', 'suspense', 'film', 'little', 'jerky', 'then', 'realize', 'are', 'thrown', 'situation', 'already', 'been', 'going', 'quite', 'time', 'feeling', 'hiccup-start', 'fades', 'away', 'rapidly', 'giving', 'open', 'air', 'what', 'come', 'smart', 'move', 'are', ""n't"", 'totally', 'clued', 'antagonist', 'motive', 'doing', 'what', 'doing', 'wife', 'even', 'surprisingly', 'violent', 'prologue', 'included', 'Instead', 'get', 'helplessly', 'watch', 'torture', 'destroy', 'psyche', 'protracted', 'devilish', 'way', 'leads', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Walbrook', 'Ms.', 'Wynyard', 'are', 'totally', 'compelling', 'believable', 'accompanied', 'plausible', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Anton', 'Walbrook', 'character', 'hardened', 'determinism', 'time', 'big', 'reveal', 'end', 'may', 'even', 'catch', 'trying', 'will', 'certain', 'pointy', 'object', 'bit', 'further', 'first', 'may', 'find', 'Diana', 'Wynyard', 'bit', 'flakey', 'see', 'been', 'being', 'done', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'how', 'else', 'would', 'act', 'just', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'story', 'taking', 'place', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'when', 'lot', 'actions', 'responses', 'were', 'status', 'quo', 'As', 'far', 'ending', 'may', 'wish', 'more', 'come', 'things', 'around', 'showing', 'how', 'pure', 'heart', 'come', 'much', 'more', 'poignant', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'felt', 'so', 'strongly', 'antagonist', 'Well', 'done', 'Anton', 'Gaslight', 'main', 'course', 'suspense', 'side', 'mystery', 'Add', 'small', 'sprinkle', 'detective', 'story', 'perfect', 'dash', 'heart', 'end', 'movie', 'up', 'excellent', 'well-rounded', 'experience', 'least', 'be', 'sampled', 'see', 'next', 'week', 'will', 'be', 'watching', '1944', 'American', 'version', 'will', 'update', 'review', 'accordingly']",Gaslight
