1227394,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B001PMR2F8,A. Boston,"[78, 91]","I grew up watching Will Smith on the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, so he's a familiar face that I enjoy seeing. I truly think he's at his best in the drama category. His has such a soothing quality to him that can speak volumes in a couple words or a look. No one else could have played an IRS agent that doesn't immediately get a door slammed in their face.For once, the plot was not spoiled before I could watch this movie on DVD. Usually you can't help but hear all about it before you see it. So I went into this knowing nothing, and while it's not completely surprising how it unfolds, it works in an amazing way.For some, they will have a very large, elephant in the room problem with a film that concerns suicide(don't worry, not spoiling for you...this is the opening scene). This is a movie that develops like a symphony, slowly building before you. It will break your heart, but let you see that some people do have the best of intentions. They're willing to sacrifice more then you'd think.Others have complained its ""slow"" or ""boring"". I believe 'seven pounds' is for those who like subtlety and things to think about. They don't give you all the information to figure out the story immediately.I watched slumdog millionaire right before this, and honestly, thought this was stunningly better and I'm really shocked it wasn't nominated for an oscar. This would have been my personal choice for best film of the year.Also, as I will always mention - finally, some good special features!! I love behind the scenes stuff, or the writers talking about how the story came to them.

But I watch them anyway, some more than once. Others, after seeing the ones that I did, I didn't give them a fair chance and sit through them. This one I saw the very beginning of several times before I had the chance to remain a captive audience. And the more things unfolded, the more I was drawn in. Once I saw Rosario Dawson, the hook was set. The movie is a little uneven-some twists a little easier to accept than others. But through them all, I couldn't wait to see more of Dawson. She typically delivers with aplomb, making others around her better even. And I liked seeing Smith in a non-Fresh Prince, not so ridiculously contrived role. You could point throughout the movie and come up with a little too much suspension of disbelief, including a lot of Smith's role, But put Wil beside Dawson and there's plenty of rooting interest. Some movies are memorable for their minor contributions. Roles that are more than a cameo, but less than a character actor. Woody Harrelson has that in this movie. This is a total left curve from his usual role. This movie is loaded with pathos. There's lots of parts that I don't like other movies for, but that I gave a pass to this one because I was so engrossed with certain elements. Because of a few performances, I pushed through it and found a pleasant surprise. Now I can't wait to watch it all the way through again.",4,Finally.

It's such a gripping and extraordinarily humanistic tale of grief, hope, love, sacrifice, and redemption.  It pulverizes your mind with its somber circumstances, but at the same time it touches deeply with its sensitivity and unexpected optimism.  That sounds contradictory, but this is a layered tale.  It is propelled by an ambitious script.Will Smith delivers another phenomenal performance.  Plus Rosario Dawson matches him step for step with an unexpectedly stunning and very ""real"" character.I suggest watching this with very little knowledge of the story.  Here's a vague guideline--A wealthy husband (Smith) is haunted by his own tragic mistake.  He subsequently makes incredible plans to redeem this severe misstep and somehow regain some semblance of self-worth.This is a small moment magnified into enormous proportions.  Each crucial moment is revealed slowly, and the final result is very lucid and life-affirming.  I'll admit, the sum of its parts might seem a little implausible.  But still, I was overwhelmed by this courageous and thought-provoking journey.  It's a strong but somber reminder of how we can all be hapless victims of circumstance.  How any small action we take can unexpectedly have an enormous effect on many people.

1227402,A3GPL5JEP3G1VS,B001PMR2F8,Hmph,"[3, 3]","The movie is about a man who carries a great weight of guilt because of something that happened a year or two ago. To make up for it, he decided to intervene in stranger's lives and help alleviate some of their biggest problems. He goes around, using his IRS identification card and personal information he collects, and tries to find people he feels are worthy of his help. One of those people, a young woman with severe heart problems, ends up taking his heart.In my opinion, it was an excellent film. Will Smith, as well as most of the supporting characters, acted their parts well and made it all believable. Plus, the movie didn't have a predictable plot; I kept watching with my eyes glued to the screen because for a long time I couldn't predict what Will Smith was trying to do.I realize the movie begins with Will reporting his own suicide attempt to 9-1-1, and some people have a huge problem with that. If that was real life, there's no way I would let someone I know commit suicide, even if it was for a reason similar to Will's character's. However, keep in mind, IT'S JUST A MOVIE. This man felt so bad about his mistakes in the past, that he could have killed himself right after the incident anyway. But instead, he did it after compensating for the trouble he caused. Yes, he could have instead lived out a full life and done charity work in developing countries, but again, this is fiction. If Will's character really did build schools and hospitals and tutor children to redeem himself, there wouldn't be enough conflict to make a movie. Also, it's rated PG-13 for some disturbing scenes, etc. Suicide is definitely terrible, but if you're under 13 or don't have the maturity to understand it's just a movie, you don't need to watch it.I just had a tiny problem with this movie, though. I feel like the audience is left in the dark for too long about what Will Smith's character is really up to, and the movie could have given us a few more hints early on. I had to go back and watch most of the scenes over again to piece together everything I learned in the end.

This was such a movie for me, which is why I decided to write this review.I don't really want to comment on the specifics of the plot and characters, since I don't think it makes sense to ""spoil"" movies for others.  I prefer to watch movies starting with little or no knowledge about them, other than knowing that the movie is good enough to watch in the first place.What I can mention are some of the main themes addressed in the movie, namely the highs of success, the emotional and circumstantial consequences of the major mistakes we make in life, suffering and loss, hope, compassion, and sacrifice.  In many ways, this movie is like the modern version of an ancient Greek tragedy, and its quality compares with the best in that genre.As far as the standard elements of moviemaking (casting, acting, cinematography, music, etc.), this movie is superb on all counts.  And I have to highlight two things: (a) Will Smith demonstrates that he's a first-class actor who deserves all his success and (b) much of the imagery in the movie is so powerful that it may become burned into your memory and soul (as it was for me).Some reviewers have criticized this movie on technicalities relating to medical and legal issues, but I think such criticisms are irrelevant and miss the point.  Remember, this is a movie, not a documentary: does anyone judge Shakespeare by such criteria?  Other reviewers complained that the movie errs in presenting the lead character as someone to emulate.  This again misses the point, and I think the main lesson is the opposite: that we should be careful to avoid repeating the lead character's original big mistake.Overall, this isn't a feel-good movie and I can't really say that it's particularly uplifting in any way.  In fact, I was moved to tears during the movie and have felt somewhat haunted since finishing it.  But the movie does succeed in poignantly displaying the human condition, including many of the lows and some of the highs, and experiencing its tragic elements may have cathartic value for you.This is a serious movie which I certainly can't recommend to everyone, but it's outstanding for the right audience.

Half of the movie-going audience is only enthralled with plot-less CGI free-for-alls where an explosion is worth a -thousand words.  While I often shut my brain off and enjoy such movies, watching an introspective, well developed story complemented by multi-layered performances is also pleasing to watch.Without spoilers, it's difficult to summarize or review this movie thoroughly.  It's enough to know that Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is a very troubled man and has plans to use his status and resources to help kind, deserving people: heart patient Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) and blind piano player Ezra (Woody Harrelson).  The final result of the film is very surprising and will almost certainly not be the expected resolution. Predictable it is not; life affirming and wonderfully philanthropic.Simply put, Smith's performance is brilliant.  Perhaps the best of his career.  His facial contortions belie his famously goofy performances and appearances.  There are no one-liners and witty quips.  Pure anguish.  Mental asceticism.  Only when Smith's character shares time with Emily and falls in love, thus gaining insight into her broken heart, does light shine at the end of the tunnel.  As a love interest Dawson is charming, easy on the eyes.  A character easy to empathize with and love.  Reserved performances from Barry Pepper and Harrelson complete the nearly flawless acting.While I can agree this is not going to hold every viewer's interest, if you stick around until the end, and can appreciate the intricacies of one man's self-imposed guilt, the melodrama reaps worthwhile rewards.",4,A tearjerker with heart,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,1670,"['should', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'Seven', 'Pounds', 'received', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'Half', 'movie-going', 'audience', 'only', 'enthralled', 'plot-less', 'CGI', 'free-for-alls', 'where', 'explosion', '-thousand', 'words', 'often', 'shut', 'brain', 'enjoy', 'such', 'movies', 'watching', 'introspective', 'well', 'developed', 'story', 'complemented', 'multi-layered', 'performances', 'also', 'pleasing', 'spoilers', 'difficult', 'summarize', 'review', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'enough', 'know', 'Ben', 'Thomas', 'Will', 'Smith', 'very', 'troubled', 'man', 'plans', 'use', 'status', 'resources', 'help', 'kind', 'deserving', 'people', 'heart', 'patient', 'Emily', 'Posa', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'piano', 'player', 'Ezra', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'final', 'result', 'film', 'very', 'surprising', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'not', 'be', 'expected', 'resolution', 'Predictable', 'not', 'life', 'affirming', 'wonderfully', 'philanthropic.Simply', 'put', 'Smith', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'career', 'facial', 'contortions', 'famously', 'goofy', 'performances', 'appearances', 'are', 'one-liners', 'witty', 'quips', 'Pure', 'anguish', 'Mental', 'asceticism', 'Only', 'when', 'Smith', 'character', 'shares', 'time', 'Emily', 'love', 'thus', 'gaining', 'insight', 'broken', 'heart', 'light', 'shine', 'end', 'tunnel', 'love', 'interest', 'Dawson', 'charming', 'easy', 'eyes', 'character', 'easy', 'empathize', 'love', 'Reserved', 'performances', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'Harrelson', 'complete', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'can', 'agree', 'not', 'going', 'hold', 'viewer', 'interest', 'stick', 'around', 'end', 'can', 'appreciate', 'intricacies', 'one', 'man', 'self-imposed', 'guilt', 'melodrama', 'worthwhile', 'rewards']",N/A

It is a darn shame that a movie of this caliber was not even recognized.

Though the film is about death, it is also about life. Life taken and life given. I dare you to watch this and not shed a single tear. Perhaps this is why it was not even nominated for an award and a movie like Slumdog won eight. I am not saying that Slumdog was a bad movie. Far from it. However, through all the little tragedies in Slumdog it is a feel good movie. Where as in Seven Pounds we have to get through the tears, or that sound that one makes when they are trying not to cry, to see that it is a feel good movie  its own right.

It is perfect on every level which is something that is hard for any reviewer to admit. The film is plain and simple and even though it was darn near predictable it was done beautifully. Will Smith plays an IRS agent by the name of Ben Thomas. It's odd because Ben goes around helping people for no reason but he carries a depressed look in his face. The entire film the mystery is, what the heck is he doing?Within the films duration, Ben changes the lives of seven people, the reason for his graciousness is revealed, and you may even learn something from it. This is an under wraps type of flick so telling any more of the story will surely mess it up for you. Checking out the mainstream reviews for this film sort of pisses me off. You have to understand that as an average person who is watching films all day looking for a reason to low grade it will love this film. It is incredible and I assure you it is worth getting.First of all what an amazing actor in Will Smith. I have said it before and I'll say it again that this man may very well be the greatest actor of our time. I say this about Will Smith because there are very few actors that get and hold the raw emotion the way he did. You truly believe that he is this man and he shows it in every bit of his being in this movie. Rosario Dawson was another, very good and maybe, no, definitely her best film. Great casting and an even greater story, this is some talented writing. Great scenes and camera work, this director really lit this film up with life. Honestly you gotta check this out, I almost didn't go see this because I still glance at the pro reviewers every once in a while. They really seem to be extremely uptight.

Will Smith stars as ""Ben Thomas,"" a man who is haunted by past demons.  Early in the film you see that he is determined to ferret out good in a few fellow humans.  Ben shows up in unconventional places, flashes his IRS credentials, then decides whether or not to give people deeply in debt to the government a reprieve or not.  You wonder whether or not the IRS makes house calls, but then you know that they don't track their clients to the hospital and silently observe them.In flashbacks we begin to see that Ben had an earlier, happier life.  An aerospace engineer, engaged to a beautiful woman and living in an extravagant beach house, you wonder what happened to transform Ben into an IRS auditor, sad and alone and living in a seedy motel.Rosario Dawson is glorious as Emily Posa, a woman who could use a little IRS relief - and a new heart.  Ben tells Emily she is being audited in a cafeteria, but she remembers seeing him before.  He was watching her while she was in her hotel room, recovering from her latest cardiac crisis.  Ben begins to not so much audit Emily as court her, and you can see that their developing romance is one of the first bits of happiness either has experienced in a long while.Woody Harrelson has an important minor role as a blind meat phone salesman, Ezra.  In an opening scene Ben phones Ezra to complain about a bad meat order.  Ben uses increasingly hostile and insulting language and Ezra takes it with a smile.  You wonder about this Ben character, but you also wonder what this first scene has to do with the remainder of the film.Ben also has a brother who phones a few times during the film.  Ben has become difficult to track down since moving to the seedy motel.  Michael Ealy plays the brother, and with a few cryptic words you know that there is more between these men than their common ancestry.Ben moves enigmatically from scene to scene, and it is not difficult to guess the final destination.

1227412,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B001PMR2F8,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[9, 12]","Seven Pounds is truly about the tragedy of human suffering, the need to feel redeemed after human mistakes happen and human compassion. The film also deals with love on several levels at once; and that's both thought-provoking and sophisticated. This film is not what you think it will be when you sit down and watch it--not even after a full hour. The filmmakers are masters at skillfully showcasing the human condition in tough situations, to say the least, right up until the very end of the movie.Seven Pounds starts with the shocking scene of a man calling 911 to report his own suicide; and the rest of the movie continues with more surprises, drama, excellent acting by all and a few flashbacks that help to flesh out the story. The plot twists are very good and keep the film interesting. There are one or two spots where they could have edited out a couple of minutes; but by the end the film is a very good experience that should stimulate a lot of conversation. The cinematography is very well done and the choreography works best in the nursing home scenes as well as the scenes at the hospital.Once we see Ben Thomas (Will Smith) calling in his own suicide to 911; the movie goes forward by showing Ben to be a tormented man haunted by the loss of his former wife. How exactly did she die? We learn that in bits and pieces of flashbacks throughout the film. What does take center stage, though, is that because he believes he was partly to blame for his wife's death, Ben quits his job as an engineer and decides to help seven strangers in his own way. Among the people Ben helps are blind customer service agent Ezra Turner (Woody Harrelson); a man to whom Ben gives one of his kidneys when Ben sees that the fellow is a real do-gooder; and a young boy with cancer who gets a bone marrow transplant from Ben. Ben even gives his home to a woman constantly beaten by her boyfriend; and Ben develops a friendship with Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), a young woman who needs a heart transplant if she is to live more than a few weeks.We know what Ben originally intends to do after he helps these people and the others; but a few very real surprises crop up that could change things easily. Ben soon finds himself conflicted; he has fallen in love with Emily but he is still so tormented by the memories of the accident that took his late wife that he must choose between his previous plans and Emily. Ben must also deal with his brother (Michael Ealy) who confronts him about something really big; his brother throws a huge curve ball into the plot that I had no idea was coming! In the end, Ben chooses what he feels is best for all concerned and even then the movie still gives you an unexpected tearjerker scene at the very last minute.The DVD comes with some nice extras including an optional running commentary with director Gabriele Muccino, deleted scenes, and a featurette of seven interviews with seven people who made this film a reality. Excellent!Seven Pounds deserved more artistic recognition than it received. Fortunately, however, we can still appreciate this film as a significant work of art and that's grand. I highly recommend this film for people interested in human issues; and people interested in drama may also want to have this movie in their collections.",5,"a story of suffering, atonement, kindness and love--BRAVO !!!",1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,3289,"['Seven', 'Pounds', 'truly', 'tragedy', 'human', 'suffering', 'need', 'feel', 'redeemed', 'human', 'mistakes', 'happen', 'human', 'compassion', 'film', 'also', 'love', 'several', 'levels', 'once', 'thought-provoking', 'sophisticated', 'film', 'not', 'what', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'when', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'not', 'even', 'full', 'hour', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'masters', 'skillfully', 'showcasing', 'human', 'condition', 'tough', 'situations', 'say', 'least', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'movie.Seven', 'Pounds', 'shocking', 'scene', 'man', 'calling', '911', 'report', 'own', 'suicide', 'rest', 'movie', 'more', 'surprises', 'drama', 'excellent', 'acting', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'keep', 'film', 'interesting', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'spots', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'edited', 'out', 'couple', 'minutes', 'end', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'experience', 'should', 'stimulate', 'lot', 'conversation', 'cinematography', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'choreography', 'best', 'nursing', 'home', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'hospital.Once', 'see', 'Ben', 'Thomas', 'Will', 'Smith', 'calling', 'own', 'suicide', '911', 'movie', 'forward', 'showing', 'Ben', 'be', 'tormented', 'man', 'haunted', 'loss', 'former', 'wife', 'How', 'exactly', 'did', 'die', 'learn', 'bits', 'pieces', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'What', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'was', 'partly', 'blame', 'wife', 'death', 'Ben', 'job', 'engineer', 'help', 'seven', 'strangers', 'own', 'way', 'people', 'Ben', 'are', 'blind', 'customer', 'service', 'agent', 'Ezra', 'Turner', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'man', 'whom', 'Ben', 'one', 'kidneys', 'when', 'Ben', 'fellow', 'real', 'do-gooder', 'young', 'boy', 'cancer', 'who', 'bone', 'marrow', 'transplant', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'even', 'home', 'woman', 'constantly', 'beaten', 'boyfriend', 'Ben', 'friendship', 'Emily', 'Posa', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'heart', 'transplant', 'live', 'more', 'few', 'weeks.We', 'know', 'what', 'Ben', 'originally', 'do', 'people', 'others', 'few', 'very', 'real', 'surprises', 'crop', 'up', 'could', 'change', 'things', 'easily', 'Ben', 'soon', 'conflicted', 'fallen', 'love', 'Emily', 'still', 'so', 'tormented', 'memories', 'accident', 'took', 'late', 'wife', 'must', 'choose', 'previous', 'plans', 'Emily', 'Ben', 'must', 'also', 'deal', 'brother', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'who', 'something', 'really', 'big', 'brother', 'huge', 'curve', 'ball', 'plot', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'coming', 'end', 'Ben', 'what', 'best', 'concerned', 'even', 'then', 'movie', 'still', 'unexpected', 'tearjerker', 'scene', 'very', 'last', 'minute.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'extras', 'including', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'Gabriele', 'Muccino', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'seven', 'interviews', 'seven', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'reality', 'Excellent', 'Seven', 'Pounds', 'deserved', 'more', 'artistic', 'recognition', 'received', 'Fortunately', 'however', 'can', 'still', 'appreciate', 'film', 'significant', 'work', 'art', 'grand', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'interested', 'human', 'issues', 'people', 'interested', 'drama', 'may', 'also', 'want', 'have', 'movie', 'collections']",N/A

Zwick,"[2, 2]","It's comparatively easy to make evil interesting on screen; making goodness dramatically compelling is a much trickier proposition altogether.  The risk, of course, is that such a portrayal will dissolve into sugariness and sentimentality, losing the hard edge that comes with taking on the more unsavory elements of the world.In ""Seven Pounds,"" Will Smith plays Ben Thomas, an I.R.S. agent who, for reasons revealed to us only at the end, has decided to bestow blessings of various kinds on certain handpicked hard luck cases whom he deems worthy of compassion.  His main focus is on Emily Posa, played by Rosario Dawson, a young woman suffering from a potentially fatal heart condition.  Throughout the course of the story, the two of them grow closer as Ben works to bring his plan to fruition.Written by Grant Nieport and directed by Gabriele Mussion, ""Seven Pounds"" does a nice job holding its cards close to the vest, allowing the viewers to exist in a state of ambiguity and uncertainty for a lot longer than they are generally called upon to do in mainstream American moviemaking.  Indeed, Smith's character remains an enigma for so long that many in the audience many feel like bailing out long before any real answers to the puzzle are finally revealed.  That would be a shame for they would have missed out on what is a sweet and compelling love story, touchingly and sensitively played by two fine actors in their primes.  While the movie may slip into implausibility and an attitude of self-importance from time to time, the stars always manage to keep it life-sized and personal.  That's especially fortuitous since the other characters - played by Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper, among others - tend to get lost in the narrative shuffle.This is definitely not the typical rock 'em, sock 'em action vehicle one naturally associates with Smith, but ""Seven Pounds"" makes for a nice little change-of-pace for the undisputed box office champ in the world today.",4,not perfect but a nice change of pace for Smith,1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,1973,"['comparatively', 'easy', 'make', 'evil', 'interesting', 'screen', 'making', 'goodness', 'dramatically', 'compelling', 'much', 'trickier', 'proposition', 'altogether', 'risk', 'course', 'portrayal', 'will', 'dissolve', 'sugariness', 'sentimentality', 'losing', 'hard', 'edge', 'taking', 'more', 'unsavory', 'elements', 'world.In', 'Seven', 'Pounds', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Ben', 'Thomas', 'I.R.S', 'agent', 'who', 'reasons', 'revealed', 'only', 'end', 'decided', 'bestow', 'blessings', 'various', 'kinds', 'certain', 'handpicked', 'hard', 'luck', 'cases', 'whom', 'worthy', 'compassion', 'main', 'focus', 'Emily', 'Posa', 'played', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'young', 'woman', 'suffering', 'potentially', 'fatal', 'heart', 'condition', 'course', 'story', 'two', 'grow', 'closer', 'Ben', 'bring', 'plan', 'fruition.Written', 'Grant', 'Nieport', 'directed', 'Gabriele', 'Mussion', 'Seven', 'Pounds', 'nice', 'job', 'holding', 'cards', 'close', 'vest', 'allowing', 'viewers', 'exist', 'state', 'ambiguity', 'uncertainty', 'lot', 'longer', 'are', 'generally', 'called', 'upon', 'do', 'mainstream', 'American', 'moviemaking', 'Indeed', 'Smith', 'character', 'enigma', 'so', 'long', 'many', 'audience', 'many', 'feel', 'bailing', 'out', 'long', 'before', 'real', 'answers', 'puzzle', 'are', 'finally', 'revealed', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'what', 'sweet', 'compelling', 'love', 'story', 'touchingly', 'sensitively', 'played', 'two', 'fine', 'actors', 'primes', 'movie', 'may', 'slip', 'implausibility', 'attitude', 'self-importance', 'time', 'time', 'stars', 'always', 'manage', 'keep', 'life-sized', 'personal', 'especially', 'fortuitous', 'other', 'characters', 'played', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'others', 'tend', 'get', 'lost', 'narrative', 'shuffle.This', 'definitely', 'not', 'typical', 'rock', 'sock', 'action', 'vehicle', 'one', 'naturally', 'Smith', 'Seven', 'Pounds', 'nice', 'little', 'change-of-pace', 'undisputed', 'box', 'office', 'champ', 'world', 'today']",N/A

Those who didn't like this movie probably have a limited understanding of what it means to show compassion towards other people.  From the special features commentary, that came with the DVD, the movie's concept was mildly based on an actual event. Seven Pounds has to be watched, not from a critical eye as to whether this movie achieved this or that, but, from the point of view of someone who is telling their story and you are the viewer. If you ignore the few negative reviews, and enjoy the movie for the compassionate theme it's portraying, you will have a better appreciation for life that transcends the daily problems we sometimes face. The chemistry between Will Smith and Rosario Dawson was great. The movie flowed well; and, the accompanying music enhanced the essence of the feelings being conveyed.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't let the trailer (for this movie) mislead you; the movie is not as suspenseful as it is made out to be; Seven Pounds is more about Love and Compassion.

Smith plays an IRS agent who seems to be randomly choosing people to help. At once, he seems to be in various stages of helping six people - a nursing home administrator, a hockey coach for disadvantaged Hispanic kids, a blind telemarketer played by Woody Harrelson, a woman with two kids being abused by her boyfriend, a little boy needing a bone marrow transplant, and last, but not least, a graphic artist played by Rosario Dawson whose heart is failing and in needed of a transplant.Smith's character insinuates himself in the lives of these people, alternately befriending them and showering them with hostility. His character is obviously wracked by guilt and the motivation to help, but we are unsure of his motives and intentions. We see only three people who know him and may know what he's up to - a childhood friend played by Barry Pepper, a civil servant place by Judy Pace, and his brother, played by Michael Ealy.We are not sure exactly what is going on until the end of the movie, and for many, it will be worth the wait to discover the secret of Seven Pounds. Smith gives an earnest, heartfelt performance, and is surrounded by exceptional supporting performances, especially by Dawson in her greatest performance to date.Seven Pounds makes some important comments about guilt, loss, redemption, and the fleetingness of life.
