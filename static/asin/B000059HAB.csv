572863,AE8W6OW6A1M5M,B000059HAB,Ibochild,"[8, 11]","SOUL FOOD is the type of movie that you like not because of what it is, but from what you hope it to be. Irrespective of your race or ethnic background, you are bound to connect on some level with this film.The story itself is not very original. It involves an African American family that gathers weekly for the family dinner. The focus is on three sisters, who share their hopes, dreams and frustrations. The story is told through the eyes of the son of the middle sister. While the film is told through a his eyes, it is not a story for children because of some of the themes explored like adultery. It's an odd way to tell this story, but it works most of the time.Unfortunately, writer/director George Tillman, Jr. (with an uncredited rewrite by Tina Andrews) do not know the meaning of subtlety and nuance. The characters are drawn with broad strokes. Teri (Vanessa L. Williams) is the cold and hard-driving overachiever of the family. Maxine (Vivica A. Fox) is the aggressive, but ""down to earth"" stay-at-home mom, and Bird (Nia Long) is the baby of the family, who has just married the neer-do-well, Lem (Mekhi Phifer). Each one of their stories follows a fairly predictable course.This is not to say that the movie is without charm. It's nice to see a black movie that is not focusing on gangs or drugs. It's also a film that shows black people from several different generations.You feel for the struggles of the characters, although many of the situations seem forced and over the top. One particular scene that comes to mind is when Teri's character pulls out a knife. It seems to completely contradict her character as an educated professional woman.The film also follows the clich&eacute; of many character driven pieces in that a key character must die. In this case, it's milked for all it's worth.Overall, SOUL FOOD is an entertaining film, but delivers a lot less than it promises. Although it was marketed as a family film, it is really for adults because of the violence and sexuality on screen. If you're looking for a film about a black family (as opposed to a black family film), it's worth a look. As long as you don't keep you expectations too high, you won't be disappointed.",3,"Soul Food Fills Your Stomach, But Is Not Entirely Satisfying",1013644800,"02 14, 2002",2002,2201,"['SOUL', 'FOOD', 'type', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'what', 'hope', 'be', 'Irrespective', 'race', 'ethnic', 'background', 'are', 'bound', 'connect', 'level', 'film.The', 'story', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'African', 'American', 'family', 'gathers', 'weekly', 'family', 'dinner', 'focus', 'three', 'sisters', 'who', 'share', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'frustrations', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'son', 'middle', 'sister', 'film', 'told', 'eyes', 'not', 'story', 'children', 'themes', 'explored', 'adultery', 'odd', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'most', 'time.Unfortunately', 'writer/director', 'George', 'Tillman', 'Jr.', 'uncredited', 'rewrite', 'Tina', 'Andrews', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'meaning', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'broad', 'strokes', 'Teri', 'Vanessa', 'L.', 'Williams', 'cold', 'hard-driving', 'overachiever', 'family', 'Maxine', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'aggressive', 'down', 'earth', 'stay-at-home', 'mom', 'Bird', 'Nia', 'Long', 'baby', 'family', 'who', 'just', 'married', 'neer-do-well', 'Lem', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'one', 'stories', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'course.This', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'charm', 'nice', 'see', 'black', 'movie', 'not', 'focusing', 'gangs', 'drugs', 'also', 'film', 'black', 'people', 'several', 'different', 'generations.You', 'feel', 'struggles', 'characters', 'many', 'situations', 'seem', 'forced', 'top', 'One', 'particular', 'scene', 'mind', 'when', 'Teri', 'character', 'out', 'knife', 'completely', 'contradict', 'character', 'educated', 'professional', 'woman.The', 'film', 'also', 'clich', 'eacute', 'many', 'character', 'driven', 'pieces', 'key', 'character', 'must', 'die', 'case', 'milked', 'worth.Overall', 'SOUL', 'FOOD', 'entertaining', 'film', 'lot', 'less', 'was', 'marketed', 'family', 'film', 'really', 'adults', 'violence', 'sexuality', 'screen', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'black', 'family', 'opposed', 'black', 'family', 'film', 'look', 'As', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

He laughs at me because nearly all of the films in my collecttion are dark, violent, and depressing. So, he made me watch ""Soul Food"" and the best part of the movie is the insight it brought to me with regard to his cooking. (I have hardly been to a restaurant since his arrival.) I know nothing about cooking, and that is probably a good thing because he says he wouldn't share his his ""secrets"" anyway. Though I HAVE noticed that he has NEVER, EVER used a measuring cup. (something that is reflected in this film.) Also, before he came I avoided green beans like the plague. (I'm sure many a Black person has knowingly mocked the rubbery, limp, God-awful things we White people call green beans. White children drench these abominations in ketchup and even then have to be forced to eat them a gunpoint...) However, there is a scene in ""Soul Food"" in which a child excitedly recites the menu that includes green beans with his smile intact, and there is not a ketchup bottle in sight. (I now have ""string beans"" with every meal.) I feel free to include these things in a review because it seesms to me that ""Soul Food"" is largely true to it's title, the movie is ABOUT THE FOOD and it's apparently unifying power, it's also about the kind of food we deprived and deathly bland White Northern dwellers have been missing.

I got that and a lot more. We watch the story unfold from the perspective of a twelve-year-old boy. From his eyes we see the stories of the Matriarch and her three daughter's families. When Big Momma dies, Chaos threatens to destroy the family as each of the three daughters become more selfish in dealing with their own personal problems. The twelve year old spends the rest of the film trying to bring his crumbling extended family back together.The production values were amazing for a $6 million dollar movie, I felt like I was watching a $50 million film. The cinematographer and director do a great job; I felt like I was on those Chicago streets along with the family. All of the actors here give great performances, Vanessa Williams, is unforgettable as Bird. Viveca Fox shows range in her role as the middle daughter and Nia Long is great as the baby of the family. On the men's side Michael Beach gives another strong performance. Beach should be a bigger star than he is; he gave some great performances in the 90's.

Like many Americans, I was starved for a movie that didn't portray the American family as broken or malignant, which appears to be the Hollywood standard.  &quot;Soul Food&quot; works primarily because it never loses sight of the importance of family, even as its members may bicker or transgress.  The plot focuses on the lasting impact of the family matriarch--Big Mama (played wonderfully by Irma P. Hall)--whose kind heart and wise soul holds the family of mostly younger couples together, despite their foibles.  When she passes away from complications due to diabetes, her daughters must overcome their differences to uphold the family traditions, best embodied by Sunday dinners that go beyond simple meals.  The cast is generally superb, though Vivica Fox and Brandon Hammond (as grandson Ahmad, through whose eyes we are told the story), sometimes try too hard, making their characters border on caricature in a film that otherwise seems so lifelike.  There is a subplot involving a hidden family fortune that also gets in the way--writer and director George Tillman, Jr., seems to want to jam as much into the story as possible when he really doesn't have to, as the main plot is interesting enough.  These flaws are oddly more apparent on the small screen than they were on the big screen.  Nonetheless, &quot;Soul Food,&quot; despite its &quot;R&quot; rating, is an effective family film, one with a sense of authenticity that Hollywood seems to have mostly forgotten.",4,"On Balance, a Strong Family Film Well Worth Seeing",1068336000,"11 9, 2003",2003,1648,"['Thank', 'goodness', 'someone', 'made', 'good', 'warm-hearted', 'film', 'family', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'thought', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'quot', 'Soul', 'Food', 'quot', 'theater', '1997', 'many', 'Americans', 'was', 'starved', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'portray', 'American', 'family', 'broken', 'malignant', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'standard', 'quot', 'Soul', 'Food', 'quot', 'primarily', 'never', 'sight', 'importance', 'family', 'even', 'members', 'may', 'bicker', 'transgress', 'plot', 'lasting', 'impact', 'family', 'matriarch', 'Big', 'Mama', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Irma', 'P.', 'Hall', 'kind', 'heart', 'wise', 'soul', 'family', 'mostly', 'younger', 'couples', 'together', 'foibles', 'When', 'away', 'complications', 'due', 'diabetes', 'daughters', 'must', 'overcome', 'differences', 'uphold', 'family', 'traditions', 'best', 'embodied', 'Sunday', 'dinners', 'go', 'simple', 'meals', 'cast', 'generally', 'superb', 'Vivica', 'Fox', 'Brandon', 'Hammond', 'grandson', 'Ahmad', 'eyes', 'are', 'told', 'story', 'sometimes', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'making', 'characters', 'border', 'caricature', 'film', 'otherwise', 'so', 'lifelike', 'subplot', 'involving', 'hidden', 'family', 'fortune', 'also', 'way', 'writer', 'director', 'George', 'Tillman', 'Jr.', 'want', 'jam', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'possible', 'when', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'main', 'plot', 'interesting', 'enough', 'flaws', 'are', 'oddly', 'more', 'apparent', 'small', 'screen', 'were', 'big', 'screen', 'Nonetheless', 'quot', 'Soul', 'Food', 'quot', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'rating', 'effective', 'family', 'film', 'one', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'mostly', 'forgotten']",N/A
