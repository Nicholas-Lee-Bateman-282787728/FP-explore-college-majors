I fell in love with the Black Butler series from the moment I first picked up the manga when it first came out last year, and when I heard about the anime I was quick to jump at the chance to add it to my collection. Anyone who hasn't read the manga or bought the DVD's yet should go out and buy them now before you miss out. *lol*Now I can't wait until Season 2 of Black Butler comes out. I hope it comes out as quickly as Season 1, Part 2 did, and they don't make us wait until the end of the year, or even NEXT YEAR for that matter, for season 2 to come out. *pouts*",5,A Must buy if you love this type of thing!,1304035200,"04 29, 2011",2011,580,"['love', 'fell', 'love', 'Black', 'Butler', 'series', 'moment', 'first', 'picked', 'up', 'manga', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'heard', 'anime', 'was', 'quick', 'jump', 'chance', 'add', 'collection', 'Anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'manga', 'bought', 'DVD', 'yet', 'should', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'now', 'miss', 'out', '*lol*Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', '2', 'Black', 'Butler', 'out', 'hope', 'out', 'as', 'quickly', 'Season', '1', 'Part', '2', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'wait', 'end', 'year', 'even', 'NEXT', 'YEAR', 'matter', 'season', '2', 'come', 'out', '*pouts*']","Black Butler: Season 1, Part 2"

1407618,A2H7SQIYMJ7RKM,B004GZZH94,"Yamila ""Keyblademaster22""","[3, 3]","Update: I deleted my 1st post because I didn't seem to make it clearly and I wanted people to get off my butt with my recent post.  (And people have been addressing me as a HE and not a SHE...)Plus, I've purchased both this part and the 1st part and the manga by the way.  Not trying to sound rude or anything but people have different views of this.  So, this is what I see in this second part:A while ago FUNimation released the first installment of Black Butler's first season. The show proved to be a fun enigmatic supernatural romp with fan-service (on the yaoi side) and a rather interesting premise. Ultimately I was left with a positive impression of the show and was eagerly anticipating the second installment. Guess what I just finished watching?In case you missed my review of the first release, Black Butler is a series about a young boy named Ciel Phantomhive. He is the heir to the Phantomhive estate and along with the riches comes power to some extent, as he's a tool for the Queen to use as she sees fit. Cie's reputation precedes him in nearly every circumstance, which is remarkable considering he's just a young boy. Behind every great boy is a sketchy man (at least in the perfect yaoi world) and in this case that guy is Sebastian, Ciel's butler.Sebastian isn't just an ordinary butler. Sure he can make a mean set of tea and crumpets, but he also happens to be a demon that answers to Ciel's command. The cost of such a relationship is the inevitable consumption of Ciel's soul by Sebastian. I suppose it's a small price to pay for power and influence, even if it just lasts for a short time. In the first volume we were introduced to the two protagonists and a host of secondary cast members. The series was often episodic in the sense that there were self-contained storylines, but most of these lasted for multiple episodes. A little bit of lore came through towards the end of the first half, and this second volume picks up where the original release left off.This installment picks up with episode 13. As the episode opens we are introduced to Prince Soma and his servant, Agni, who quite literally wind up bumping into Ciel and Sebastian. Soon enough they mend their rocky introduction and the pair of master and servant actually wind up staying at the Phantomhive Estate for some time. There's more to Agni's character than initially meets the eye, however, and by the end of this storyline we actually get to see the Queen in the subsequent episode. The conclusion of the Soma and Agni plotline is rather corny, but there's a certain charm to it.As the show moves forward there are some episodic episodes, and a smallish storyline that deals with an angel of sorts. The show continues to introduce new characters at it heads towards its finale, though I must say they add something to the show. The villains in this series have always been intriguing in a sense and I'm pleased to report this installment is no different. I also don't want to divulge much about the conclusion of the series, but let's just say it's rather dramatic and finite (though there is a second season, so maybe it's not as definite as one might think).If you saw, and appreciated, the first installment of Black Butler, then you'll definitely enjoy what's in store with these episodes. The show provides some solid adventures at its midpoint and towards its final run, and ultimately it's entertaining. I'd still profess that it's not entirely for everyone though. The yaoi fan-service, though relatively light, is still omnipresent, and that's definitely something that's not for everyone. Even so the show is intriguing and enjoyable enough to warrant a universal recommendation.",5,"Black Butler: Season One, Part 2",1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,3689,"['Update', 'deleted', '1st', 'post', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'clearly', 'wanted', 'people', 'get', 'off', 'butt', 'recent', 'post', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'addressing', 'HE', 'not', 'SHE', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'part', '1st', 'part', 'manga', 'way', 'Not', 'trying', 'sound', 'rude', 'anything', 'people', 'have', 'different', 'views', 'So', 'what', 'see', 'second', 'part', 'while', 'FUNimation', 'released', 'first', 'installment', 'Black', 'Butler', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'proved', 'be', 'fun', 'enigmatic', 'supernatural', 'romp', 'fan-service', 'yaoi', 'side', 'rather', 'interesting', 'premise', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'left', 'positive', 'impression', 'show', 'was', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'second', 'installment', 'Guess', 'what', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'case', 'missed', 'review', 'first', 'release', 'Black', 'Butler', 'series', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Ciel', 'Phantomhive', 'heir', 'Phantomhive', 'estate', 'riches', 'power', 'extent', 'tool', 'Queen', 'use', 'fit', 'Cie', 'reputation', 'nearly', 'circumstance', 'remarkable', 'considering', 'just', 'young', 'boy', 'great', 'boy', 'sketchy', 'man', 'least', 'perfect', 'yaoi', 'world', 'case', 'guy', 'Sebastian', 'Ciel', 'butler.Sebastian', ""n't"", 'just', 'ordinary', 'butler', 'can', 'make', 'mean', 'set', 'tea', 'crumpets', 'also', 'be', 'demon', 'Ciel', 'command', 'cost', 'relationship', 'inevitable', 'consumption', 'Ciel', 'soul', 'Sebastian', 'suppose', 'small', 'price', 'pay', 'power', 'influence', 'even', 'just', 'short', 'time', 'first', 'volume', 'were', 'introduced', 'two', 'protagonists', 'host', 'secondary', 'cast', 'members', 'series', 'was', 'often', 'episodic', 'sense', 'were', 'self-contained', 'storylines', 'most', 'lasted', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'little', 'bit', 'lore', 'came', 'end', 'first', 'half', 'second', 'volume', 'up', 'where', 'original', 'release', 'left', 'off.This', 'installment', 'up', 'episode', '13', 'episode', 'are', 'introduced', 'Prince', 'Soma', 'servant', 'Agni', 'who', 'quite', 'literally', 'wind', 'up', 'bumping', 'Ciel', 'Sebastian', 'Soon', 'mend', 'rocky', 'introduction', 'pair', 'master', 'servant', 'actually', 'wind', 'up', 'staying', 'Phantomhive', 'Estate', 'time', 'more', 'Agni', 'character', 'initially', 'eye', 'however', 'end', 'storyline', 'actually', 'get', 'see', 'Queen', 'subsequent', 'episode', 'conclusion', 'Soma', 'Agni', 'plotline', 'rather', 'corny', 'certain', 'charm', 'it.As', 'show', 'forward', 'are', 'episodic', 'episodes', 'smallish', 'storyline', 'deals', 'angel', 'sorts', 'show', 'introduce', 'new', 'characters', 'finale', 'must', 'say', 'add', 'something', 'show', 'villains', 'series', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'intriguing', 'sense', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'report', 'installment', 'different', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'divulge', 'much', 'conclusion', 'series', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'rather', 'dramatic', 'finite', 'second', 'season', 'so', 'maybe', 'not', 'as', 'definite', 'one', 'might', 'think', '.If', 'saw', 'appreciated', 'first', 'installment', 'Black', 'Butler', 'then', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'what', 'store', 'episodes', 'show', 'solid', 'adventures', 'midpoint', 'towards', 'final', 'run', 'ultimately', 'entertaining', ""'d"", 'still', 'profess', 'not', 'entirely', 'everyone', 'though', 'yaoi', 'fan-service', 'relatively', 'light', 'still', 'omnipresent', 'definitely', 'something', 'not', 'everyone', 'Even', 'show', 'intriguing', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'warrant', 'universal', 'recommendation']","Black Butler: Season 1, Part 2"
