414834,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,6304326319,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 2]","From the earliest films, The Apu Trilogy (1959) to his latest The Stranger (Agantuk), from India, filmmaker Satyajit Ray has garnered numerous awards and is recognized as one of the greatest directors.  With his work, he wore many hats, including that of a writer and a graphic artist.Ray was born in 1921 and died in 1992 and made 40 films and documentaries.  If you enjoy foreign film, see at least one of Satyajit Ray's films.  Especially this one!  Characters are good, dialogue is excellent.Filmed in 1991, most of the setting takes place in the house, there is no soundtrack, it is 120 minutes and in color.  Don't watch while sleepy, there is great challenging dialogue you won't want to miss.Anali Bose, her husband, Sudhindra Bose, and their young son live well with servants in India.  Anali receives a letter that an uncle, Manomohan Mitra, is coming to visit and she saw him when she was only 2 years old.  Anali's husband believes him to be an imposter.Anali follows tradition to treat a guest with respect, but her husband's suspicions lay heavy on her mind.  Meanwhile, the uncle, Mitra, learns the doubt the family has.  Mitra is a world traveler, fluent in many languages, a learned man, and has a keen philosophical sense of life.The husband, Sudhindra, at two different times, invites ""qualified""  friends over to challenge and grill Mitra to find the truth.""Come Clean or Clear Out""Those are the exact English words said by one frustrated interrogators during one of the grillings that the uncle is subjected to.  The grilling sessions are quite amusing and informative.English language widely used.What has struck me about this film were the many uses of the English language and phrases intermingled and spoken by all.  It is puzzling.Highly recommend Ray'sJalsaghar - The Music Room (1958):  An aging feudal landlord's prized jovial music room reveals the emptiness, cold and decay as the entire palace slowy deteriorates......Rizzo",5,"Insightful, engaging and entertaining!",1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,1955,"['earliest', 'films', 'Apu', 'Trilogy', '1959', 'latest', 'Stranger', 'Agantuk', 'India', 'filmmaker', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'garnered', 'numerous', 'awards', 'recognized', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'work', 'wore', 'many', 'hats', 'including', 'writer', 'graphic', 'artist.Ray', 'was', 'born', '1921', 'died', '1992', 'made', '40', 'films', 'documentaries', 'enjoy', 'foreign', 'film', 'see', 'least', 'one', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'films', 'Especially', 'one', 'Characters', 'are', 'good', 'dialogue', 'excellent.Filmed', '1991', 'most', 'setting', 'place', 'house', 'soundtrack', '120', 'minutes', 'color', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'sleepy', 'great', 'challenging', 'dialogue', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss.Anali', 'Bose', 'husband', 'Sudhindra', 'Bose', 'young', 'son', 'live', 'well', 'servants', 'India', 'Anali', 'letter', 'uncle', 'Manomohan', 'Mitra', 'coming', 'visit', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'only', '2', 'years', 'old', 'Anali', 'husband', 'be', 'imposter.Anali', 'tradition', 'treat', 'guest', 'respect', 'husband', 'suspicions', 'lay', 'heavy', 'mind', 'Meanwhile', 'uncle', 'Mitra', 'doubt', 'family', 'Mitra', 'world', 'traveler', 'fluent', 'many', 'languages', 'learned', 'man', 'keen', 'philosophical', 'sense', 'life.The', 'husband', 'Sudhindra', 'two', 'different', 'times', 'qualified', 'challenge', 'grill', 'Mitra', 'find', 'truth', 'Come', 'Clean', 'Clear', 'Out', 'are', 'exact', 'English', 'words', 'said', 'one', 'frustrated', 'interrogators', 'one', 'grillings', 'uncle', 'subjected', 'grilling', 'sessions', 'are', 'quite', 'amusing', 'informative.English', 'language', 'widely', 'used.What', 'struck', 'film', 'were', 'many', 'uses', 'English', 'language', 'phrases', 'intermingled', 'spoken', 'puzzling.Highly', 'recommend', ""Ray'sJalsaghar"", 'Music', 'Room', '1958', 'aging', 'feudal', 'landlord', 'prized', 'jovial', 'music', 'room', 'emptiness', 'cold', 'decay', 'entire', 'palace', 'slowy', 'deteriorates', 'Rizzo']",The Stranger VHS

On one level, it is an endearing story of a long lost uncle who comes back after many years and throws a typical middle class household into disarray. Is he for real or an imposter ? On the other level, it is a movie about our basic conceptions of civilization, and of our myopic tendency to compartmentalize the world into  ""family"" and ""strangers"".Unlike some of Ray's later works, this movie does not become preachy or unduly morose..rather there is a subtle strain of humor that runs through the entire movie .Acting-wise, Utpal Dutt, in his last role also, gives us the performance of a lifetime. This movie is all Utpal Dutt and there is noone who could have done justice to the role other than him. The supporting cast is stellar comprising some of the best actors of Bengali cinema. And throughout the movie, the technical polish and consummate artistry that is the stamp of a Ray movie is embellished in each shot.Great till the very end... the only regret is that we will never  see movie making like this again.",5,The last work of a genius,1028332800,"08 3, 2002",2002,1152,"['Satyajit', 'Ray', 'last', 'bow', 'doubt', 'one', 'finest.The', 'movie', 'most', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'classics', 'many', 'levels', 'one', 'level', 'endearing', 'story', 'long', 'lost', 'uncle', 'who', 'back', 'many', 'years', 'typical', 'middle', 'class', 'household', 'disarray', 'real', 'imposter', 'other', 'level', 'movie', 'basic', 'conceptions', 'civilization', 'myopic', 'tendency', 'compartmentalize', 'world', 'family', 'strangers', 'Ray', 'later', 'movie', 'not', 'become', 'preachy', 'unduly', 'morose..rather', 'subtle', 'strain', 'humor', 'entire', 'movie', '.Acting-wise', 'Utpal', 'Dutt', 'last', 'role', 'also', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'movie', 'Utpal', 'Dutt', 'noone', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'justice', 'role', 'other', 'supporting', 'cast', 'stellar', 'comprising', 'best', 'actors', 'Bengali', 'cinema', 'movie', 'technical', 'polish', 'consummate', 'artistry', 'stamp', 'Ray', 'movie', 'embellished', 'shot.Great', 'very', 'end', 'only', 'regret', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'movie', 'making', 'again']",The Stranger VHS

It is about the chase for a Nazi war criminal who has managed to erase his tracks and has emigrated to the US where he managed to integrate the good society of a small town. He was responsible for the final solution in one important concentration camp. The first idea that comes clearly from the film is that a criminal of that type can never reform and is a perverted mind and man forever. He has to be caught and neutralized. He has to be brought to court to answer for his crimes. The film is quite well done and the suspense is rather well built. The end is spectacular and very demonstrative of what such a criminal can come to if he feels menaced. Even love cannot erase his crimes and cannot make him come to terms with his responsibility because he has no conscience any more. To be shown to young audiences for them to see what war and fascism can lead to.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,"A monster can look very sociable, and yet",1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,929,"['film', 'rather', 'important', 'even', 'today', 'chase', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'who', 'managed', 'erase', 'tracks', 'emigrated', 'US', 'where', 'managed', 'integrate', 'good', 'society', 'small', 'town', 'was', 'responsible', 'final', 'solution', 'one', 'important', 'concentration', 'camp', 'first', 'idea', 'clearly', 'film', 'criminal', 'type', 'can', 'never', 'reform', 'perverted', 'mind', 'man', 'forever', 'be', 'caught', 'neutralized', 'be', 'brought', 'court', 'answer', 'crimes', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'suspense', 'rather', 'well', 'built', 'end', 'spectacular', 'very', 'demonstrative', 'what', 'criminal', 'can', 'come', 'menaced', 'Even', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'erase', 'crimes', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'come', 'terms', 'responsibility', 'conscience', 'more', 'be', 'shown', 'young', 'audiences', 'see', 'what', 'war', 'fascism', 'can', 'lead', 'to.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",The Stranger VHS

Mitra.&quot; But is he a relative?  Her husband doubts whether Mitra is really her uncle.  She doubts it also, but is frightful of being unhospitable to her own uncle.  They agonize over what to do-- how to treat this man, when he may be a dear relative, away from the family for 35 years, and he may be a fraud.It's been done many times in many movies; the stranger comes into a family and disrupts the quiet domestic life with his foreign ways, his &quot;differentness,&quot; but in this potent drama, director Ray injects the question of identity.  Is M. Mitra who he says he is?  And even if he is, what are his motives? The plot of Agantuk is very simple, but the movie asks the viewer to reconsider how he sees strangers in his society.  The setting and characters are of India, but the themes of the movie are universal.Utpal Dutt is wonderful as M. Mitra, the stranger.Robi Ghosh is also sensational-- knee-slappingly funny as a family friend who begs to visit so he can slyly question M. Mitra, to determine his authenticity.Mamata Shankar plays the role of the mother/wife with understated grace, until late in the movie.  Then she brings the movie a great deal of heart, in a scene where she openly grieves about the way her family has treated M. Mitra.  The scene is touching without being mawkish.If you love great cinema and gripping drama, rent or buy Agantuk (The Stranger).

414839,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,6304326319,Richard J. Brzostek,"[5, 5]","The Stranger (Agantuk) is a drama about a man who suddenly interrupts the lives of a family.  A woman receives a letter from her uncle that left India when she was a small child.  As 35 years have passed, it comes as quite a surprise that he now wants to see her and her family.  Her husband is suspicious that he may be an imposter or have ulterior motives in wanting to see them.  Her son is more trusting and accepts him as his great uncle and is spellbound by the stories of his travels.Although the story is simple, it has a lot of suspense.  The family is put into a strange and difficult place as they treat someone they don't know as honored guest.  Their own suspicions do not serve them well as it makes them uncertain of who he is.  The stranger is philosophical, worldly, and claims to have experiences that are nearly unbelievable.  To a degree, the stranger doesn't help settle their doubts with firm evidence or even conviction that he is really her uncle.  He merely tells them that they will believe he is or is not their uncle on their own.Agantuk is Satyajit Ray's last film; it has everything one would expect of this great director and is sure to please his fans.  Satyajit Ray is a remarkable Bengali director that has the talent to capture one's attention and make one totally absorbed in the world he presents.  Although I have never been disappointed by any of his movies, I have to say that The Stranger is one of my favorite films by Satyajit Ray.",5,A drama about a man who suddenly interrupts the lives of a family,1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,1474,"['Stranger', 'Agantuk', 'drama', 'man', 'who', 'suddenly', 'lives', 'family', 'woman', 'letter', 'uncle', 'left', 'India', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'child', '35', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'quite', 'surprise', 'now', 'see', 'family', 'husband', 'suspicious', 'may', 'be', 'imposter', 'have', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'wanting', 'see', 'son', 'more', 'trusting', 'great', 'uncle', 'spellbound', 'stories', 'story', 'simple', 'lot', 'suspense', 'family', 'put', 'strange', 'difficult', 'place', 'treat', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'honored', 'guest', 'own', 'suspicions', 'do', 'not', 'serve', 'well', 'uncertain', 'who', 'stranger', 'philosophical', 'worldly', 'claims', 'have', 'experiences', 'are', 'nearly', 'unbelievable', 'degree', 'stranger', ""n't"", 'help', 'settle', 'doubts', 'firm', 'evidence', 'even', 'conviction', 'really', 'uncle', 'merely', 'will', 'believe', 'not', 'uncle', 'own.Agantuk', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'last', 'film', 'everything', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'great', 'director', 'sure', 'please', 'fans', 'Satyajit', 'Ray', 'remarkable', 'Bengali', 'director', 'talent', 'capture', 'one', 'attention', 'make', 'one', 'totally', 'absorbed', 'world', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'disappointed', 'movies', 'have', 'say', 'Stranger', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Satyajit', 'Ray']",The Stranger VHS
