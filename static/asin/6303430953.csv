Reagan is essentially the de-facto leader of a group of ailing G.I.s of differing nationalities sidelined in a British run hospital in Burma during the waning days of World War II.  When the occasion called for it or the material warranted it Reagan rose to the challenge which is the case here.  Essentially, though, this film is more of a vehicle for Richard Todd who plays a headstrong Scotsman who has days to live.  Todd's character goes through the most changes in the film and he is superb.  At first his charcter is disagreeable but through a believable transformation we grow to like him.  Also good is Patricia Neal as a sympathetic Canadian nurse.  The film is sentimental without being mawkish.  It earns it's tears.  ""The Hasty Heart"" is part of ""The Ronald Reagan Signature Collection"" and is not being sold separately.  I can attest that this is a superlative collection but's it's a shame that Warner Brothers is not selling it apart from the set.",5,Heart-Rending Film,1157760000,"09 9, 2006",2006,1123,"['who', 'would', 'dismiss', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'acting', 'ability', 'asthetic', 'politically', 'partisan', 'reasons', 'would', 'be', 'advised', 'check', 'out', 'Hasty', 'Heart', 'Reagan', 'essentially', 'de-facto', 'leader', 'group', 'ailing', 'G.I.s', 'differing', 'nationalities', 'sidelined', 'British', 'run', 'hospital', 'Burma', 'waning', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'When', 'occasion', 'called', 'material', 'warranted', 'Reagan', 'rose', 'challenge', 'case', 'here', 'Essentially', 'though', 'film', 'more', 'vehicle', 'Richard', 'Todd', 'who', 'headstrong', 'Scotsman', 'who', 'days', 'live', 'Todd', 'character', 'most', 'changes', 'film', 'superb', 'first', 'charcter', 'disagreeable', 'believable', 'transformation', 'grow', 'like', 'Also', 'good', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'sympathetic', 'Canadian', 'nurse', 'film', 'sentimental', 'being', 'mawkish', 'tears', 'Hasty', 'Heart', 'part', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Signature', 'Collection', 'not', 'being', 'sold', 'separately', 'can', 'attest', 'superlative', 'collection', 'shame', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'not', 'selling', 'apart', 'set']",Hasty Heart VHS

At the close of World War Two, and following surgery for the removal of a kidney, he recovers in a jungle hospital, with the truth about his very serious condition being kept from him.  His anger over his lack of a discharge, coupled with his hard attitude and demeanor, keeps him separated from fellow patients and nurse Patricia Neal.  Attempts are made to befriend him, but it only leads to conflict.  Ronald Reagan is the American patient &quot;Yank&quot; and he gives one of his better performances.  Neal is also good, although a little detached, as the nurse trying to keep the peace.  But it's Todd who really stands out, giving a moving performance as the friend-less Scotsman who has never fit in and has been hardened by the experience.  The scenes are played with honesty, and although the film reveals its stage origins, it doesn't seem static.

Those patients who can travel are going home, but five remain (including one played by Ronald Reagan).  The head nurse (Patricia Neal) tells the men that a Scottish soldier (Richard Todd) is going to be joining them and asks for their help.  He has only a few weeks to live and is too ill to travel; since he has no family, she asks the men to befriend the solider in his last days  - but not to tell him he's dying.This is a touching drama with many moments of humor.  The soldiers are all believable and their camaraderie is heartening.  Star Richard Todd does a great job with the Scottish accent.  He plays a tough, bitter man who never knew how to make friends and when he finally does shed his defenses, he ""shares a moment with kings.""  The lovely Patricia Neal is perfect as the compassionate nurse who helps the soldier find peace and Ronald Reagan is quite likable as the wise and easy-going ""Yank.""The story really made me think about what I would want were I in this soldier's predicament.  To know or not to know?  To try and go half-way around the globe to die in an empty house or stay among new friends?

Lachie is unaware of his condition and demands to be sent home to Scotland.  He's also a bit of a tough loner, and his physician decides to enlist the help of Sister Parker (Patricia Neal) to help Lachie die with some dignity.  Sister Parker and her patients (including a youngish Ronald Reagan) try to befriend Lachie to make his final weeks more comfortable.  The young Scot, though, refuses to cooperate.Based on the play by John Patrick, ""The Hasty Heart"" provides some shrewd insight into the nature of friendship and the way in which people question each others' motives.  Although elements of the storyline are a bit dated, the film is tremendously moving at times.  Richard Todd, in his film debut, is spectacular as the stubborn Scotsman.  Todd served in WWII, and is completely believable in this role.  He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, losing to Broderick Crawford for ""All the King's Men.""  Todd also won the Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer - Male.  Reagan has one of his better roles here, in what is arguably one of his best films, along with ""King's Row.""  The film at times veers towards sappy melodrama, but skilled director, Vincent Sherman (""Mr. Skeffington,"" ""Old Acquaintance""), keeps things on the right track.
