I won't bore you by giving all the details but lets just say it's something everyone would love to have. 3 disc set has all 24 episodes and is almost 10 hours long. From the years 1978-1979.

998003,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000G0O5JG,andy8047,"[12, 15]","I incorrectly mentioned in my review for the season 4 set that Jay Hammer joined the Jeffersons cast as Allan Willis. His tenure begins this season. Allan,son of Tom(the late Franklin Cover) and Helen Willis(the late Roxie Roker),has more of his father's skin than his mother's. In the case of his sister Jenny Jefferson(Berlinda Tolbert),it's the opposite. Allan first appeared on a guest star basis in a season 1 episode,played by another actor. George Jefferson(Sherman Hemsley) referred to Allan as a ""zebra who lost his stripes""! Well,Allan finds employment in Manhattan and moves in with his parents. It is mentioned this season that George's mother Olivia ""Mama"" Jefferson has passed away,as did her portrayer,86-year-old Zara Cully. Louise or ""Weezy""(the late Isabel Sanford) is now working with Helen at The Help Center(obviously they are both caring individuals). George still has his Jefferson Cleaners drycleaning business and Tom is still with Pelham Publishers. It is sometime this season that Damon Evans relinquished his role of Lionel Jefferson,son of George and Weezy and husband of Jenny. Lionel's original portrayer,Mike Evans would return to the series at the beginning of the 1979-80 season and depart again at the end of the following season. This season,The Jeffersons' ""niece"" or ""nephew"" Good Times had been cancelled and ME,who co-created GT with Eric Monte,would be able to return the following season. Hey,my funny bones will be tickled again when I hear ""honky"" and ""zebra"" coming out of George's mouth. George said to English neighbor Harry Bentley(Paul Benedict) in one episode,""The last thing I need is a honky on my back!"". This season marks Sanford's ninth playing Louise. Louise debuted on an All In The Family season 1 episode. AITF Season 1 marked ME's debut as Lionel as well(the series premiere actually). Hemsley debuted as George in an AITF Season 4 episode,toasting his brother Henry. Sadly,Cleveland native Cover passed away in February at age 77 of pneumonia in Engelwood,New Jersey. He was recuparating from a heart ailment at a nursing home there. So I dedicate this item to his memory. I also dedicate this item to the memories of Cully(1892-1978),Roker(1929-1995) and Sanford(1917-2004). Oh by the way,I didn't want to end this review without mentioning Marla Gibbs,who was the Jeffersons' live-in housekeeper. Gibbs is Florence Johnston who is still aggravated by George's arrogant demeanor. Like the opening montages for seasons 3 and 4,this season's montages features clips from previous season episodes. But there are some different ones like Florence kneeling on the Jeffersons' living room floor dressed like Aunt Jemima,George and Louise dressed as a cowboy and Cleopatra,respectively and George moving circularly on his toes. I have not seen these episodes since TV Land last aired them in 2002. So,let's keep ""movin' on up!""

There's a new addition to the cast this season, as Jay Hammer portrays Tom & Helen Willis's biological son Allan (the ""white sheep of the family"", as George refers to him). Allan was fist seen in the final Season One episode ""Jenny's Low"" (with Allan played by Andrew Rubin). We get more than a mere glimpse of Allan Willis the first time we see him this season in the two-part episode titled ""Homecoming"", with Allan inheriting a warehouse from his grandfather's will. George does all he can to scheme his way into wrangling the property for his dry cleaning establishment with hilarious results. There's ""Half A Brother"", where Allan takes an interest in a lovely young lady, who happens to be the daughter of a prominent bank president whom George is trying to gain an account for his business. Willie Tyler & Lester guest-star in the episode ""George's New Stockbroker"", where George is hesitant to hire Tyler's character due to his medical past. Billy Dee Williams also guest-stars in the episode ""Me & Billy Dee"", where Florence is excited to meet her idol, until she learns George has hired a double that looks like Billy Dee, giving the double the third-degree until she learns it's actually him! George needs help from an old Navy buddy in the form of a loan for the Help Center in the episode ""How Soon They Forget"", while George has a bad dream where he finds himself in the year 1996 & finds that business is better than ever, with 20 stores to his credit, but something's missing...Louise. An episode with hilarious results, for sure! George's cousin needs a new kidney in the episode ""What Are Friends For?"", while George learns a secret a family friend had with George's mother in ""George Finds A Father"". As far as Season Five is concerned, although Zara Cully & her Mother Jefferson character passed away in the previous season, this season didn't suffer in terms of production value, as the writing & acting are still top-notch. This season would be Jay Hammer's only season, as it would be explained the following season Allan went to New Mexico to rejoin his commune. Because of the fact Season Five is still in that classic, comical vein, is an absolute reason to make ""The Jeffersons - The Complete Fifth Season"" an all-important title to add to your video collection today!R.I.P., Sherman Hemsley, Isabel Sanford, Roxie Roker, Franklin Cover, Paul Benedict, Ned Wertimer & Vernon Washington.",5,"George & Louise are still ""Movin' On Up"" in Season 5!",1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,2640,"['Season', 'Five', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'stellar', 'previous', 'season', 'Jeffersons', 'still', 'lot', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'such', 'Louise', 'Painting', 'George', 'tizzy', 'wife', 'interest', 'sketch', 'art', 'new', 'addition', 'cast', 'season', 'Jay', 'Hammer', 'Tom', 'Helen', 'Willis', 'biological', 'son', 'Allan', 'white', 'sheep', 'family', 'George', 'refers', 'Allan', 'was', 'fist', 'seen', 'final', 'Season', 'One', 'episode', 'Jenny', 'Low', 'Allan', 'played', 'Andrew', 'Rubin', 'get', 'more', 'mere', 'glimpse', 'Allan', 'Willis', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'season', 'two-part', 'episode', 'titled', 'Homecoming', 'Allan', 'inheriting', 'warehouse', 'grandfather', 'will', 'George', 'can', 'scheme', 'way', 'wrangling', 'property', 'dry', 'cleaning', 'establishment', 'hilarious', 'results', 'Half', 'Brother', 'where', 'Allan', 'interest', 'lovely', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'be', 'daughter', 'prominent', 'bank', 'president', 'whom', 'George', 'trying', 'gain', 'account', 'business', 'Willie', 'Tyler', 'Lester', 'guest-star', 'episode', 'George', 'New', 'Stockbroker', 'where', 'George', 'hesitant', 'hire', 'Tyler', 'character', 'due', 'medical', 'past', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'also', 'episode', 'Me', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'where', 'Florence', 'excited', 'meet', 'idol', 'George', 'hired', 'double', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'giving', 'double', 'third-degree', 'actually', 'George', 'help', 'old', 'Navy', 'buddy', 'form', 'loan', 'Help', 'Center', 'episode', 'How', 'Soon', 'Forget', 'George', 'bad', 'dream', 'where', 'year', '1996', 'business', 'better', 'ever', '20', 'stores', 'credit', 'something', 'missing', 'Louise', 'episode', 'hilarious', 'results', 'sure', 'George', 'cousin', 'new', 'kidney', 'episode', 'What', 'Are', 'Friends', 'George', 'secret', 'family', 'friend', 'had', 'George', 'mother', 'George', 'Finds', 'A', 'Father', 'As', 'far', 'Season', 'Five', 'concerned', 'Zara', 'Cully', 'Mother', 'Jefferson', 'character', 'passed', 'away', 'previous', 'season', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'terms', 'production', 'value', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'still', 'top-notch', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'Jay', 'Hammer', 'only', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'explained', 'following', 'season', 'Allan', 'went', 'New', 'Mexico', 'rejoin', 'commune', 'fact', 'Season', 'Five', 'still', 'classic', 'comical', 'vein', 'absolute', 'reason', 'make', 'Jeffersons', 'Complete', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'all-important', 'title', 'add', 'video', 'collection', 'today', 'R.I.P.', 'Sherman', 'Hemsley', 'Isabel', 'Sanford', 'Roxie', 'Roker', 'Franklin', 'Cover', 'Paul', 'Benedict', 'Ned', 'Wertimer', 'Vernon', 'Washington']",The Jeffersons: Season 5
