184875,A9Y947FCJZPVL,1567301789,Arcadio Bolaos,"[1, 1]","Andrew Birkin's film has it all: intense characters, controversial situations and unusual concepts, which shouldn't come as a surprise if we keep in mind that it's based upon a novel by Ian McEwan. The protagonists are Jack, a 16 year-old boy and Julie, his sister, barely a couple of years older; then come the youngest sister and the youngest brother. The four of them live with their parents, in a somehow bleak house, completely isolated from other neighborhoods.Jack spends most of his time avoiding his home duties, such as cleaning up his room, and instead devotes most of his hours in a secluded spot in which he hides a worn out adult magazine and toilet paper. His mother actually confronts him and tells him, following the pseudo-scientific approach from Victorian age (which Foucault so aptly analyzed in his History of sexuality), that his moodiness and messiness is a direct result of self-abuse, and that should he continue practicing that he would end up extenuating his body.One afternoon, the father is pouring cement into the garden and asks Jack for help, but while the father keeps working on the garden, the young boy is in the bathroom masturbating enthusiastically, with precise visual transitions, the director manages to apprise the moment of Jack's orgasm with the last breadth of the father, as he succumbs to a heart attack. Later on, Jack will tell to his sister ""Besides... not my fault he died"", answering a question that no sibling had dared to ask up to that moment.The absence of the father marks the downfall of the family. The mother is unable to step out of her room, depressed as she is, and order and discipline soon turns into chaos and disarray. It's in this context that the constant taunting between Jack and Julie turns into something else. What at first begins as innocent flirtations soon brings up more tantalizing repartees. In one occasion, while Jack is on top of Julie, tickling her, she starts grabbing him in a very distinct manner and comes to an orgasm.As the mother falls deeper into depression and illness, the fear of being discovered is diluted and thus the incestuous fantasy acquires a firm grasp on reality. As Lacan analyzed in his Antigone seminar, the death drive moves the Greek heroine towards the desire invested exclusively around the body of her deceased brother. In ""The Cement Garden"", the protagonists start cajoling themselves around this death drive that disappears and leaves only a very real desire and a very real erotic drive. ""My brother is what he is"" would say Antigone, and in a similar way Jack will tell her sister that if people love him then they will take him as he is.In Ancient Greece the term ""autadelphos"" (autos: ""same""; adelphos: ""sisterly,"" related to delphus: ""womb"") would mean something irreplaceable. AsAntigonesays in Sophocles' play, if she would lose her children she could always get pregnant again, if she would lose her husband she could always find another man, but if she loses her brother, who could possibly replace him? They are, after all, creatures that have shared the same womb and nothing can compare to that. In a similar fashion, the passion between Jack and Julie defies all social norms and regulations. They are irreplaceable for each other, and as the house starts falling apart, they start getting closer and closer.The absence of the father also means the absence of the nom de pere, the ultimate authority that inscribes the subject into society, that commands his offspring to occupy the male or female position in the symbolic order. Without this authority, male and female positions are interchangeable whether ideologically or practically, as it's made evident by the authority invested upon Julie, who has the full responsibility of being in charge of the house (a role that would be traditionally ascribed to a male), or by the youngest brother's obsession in wearing wigs and skirts, not only dressing up as a girl but also sleeping on the bed with another boy his age, pretending to be Julie and Jack. When Jack intends to stop this peculiar practices, Julie has but one answer for him: ""You think that being a girl is degrading but secretly you'd love to know what is it like, wouldn't you?"", and in a very tantalizing way places a most effeminate ribbon on his brother's neck.Crossing all boundaries, subverting the heterosexual normative and assuming incest as something that feels natural and real, Birkin's film announces from the very beginning a dreadful end; perhaps it would be interesting to compare the novel's ending (The Cement Garden) with the one in the film, because after all, once all is said and done, as Lacan would phrase it ""...is important to note that one only has to make a conceptual shift and move the night spent with the lady from the category of pleasure to that of jouissance, given that jouissance implies precisely the acceptance of death -- and there's no need of sublimation -- for the example to be ruined"".",5,The irreplaceable sibling -

184879,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1567301789,Dennis Littrell,"[19, 30]","There's an almost heroic honesty to this urbanized, co-ed ""Lord of the Flies""-ish love story.  A square stone house serves as the isolated island while the jungle is the familiar setting of urban sprawl and other people.  Director Andrew Birkin, in adapting Ian McEwan's novel (The Comfort of  Strangers) to the screen, doesn't try to shock us.  He just ignores our  prejudices and lets fall away our preconceptions.  What emerges is a sense  of liberation from the usual hypocrisy.The love story is an acting out  of sister-brother incest, almost a celebration of it.  ""Seems natural to  me"" is what fifteen-year-old Jack (Andrew Robertson) says while in the  naked embrace of his older sister Julie (Charlotte Gainsbourg).  I could  almost buy it, but I know of the ""kibbutz effect"" in which it was found  that unrelated children growing up together virtually never married one  another.  If sister and brother grow up separately there can be sexual  excitement between them, but if they grow up in the same household they  tend to find each other sexually boring.  Family members usually work out  the sexual tension through play at an early age so that by the time they  are sexually mature, they are looking elsewhere.  That's how the incest  taboo works.  Its purpose is to channel the sexual drive outward, the  better to mix the gene pool.  For the individual, incest is not an  attractive option socially or economically because it is so much better to  increase one's family and influence by joining with someone from another  tribe or band.  If you marry your sister, you don't gain any brothers.  Consequently the average person recoils (or at least pretends to) at the  mere suggestion of incest, and it is this mindless, knee jerk reaction that  this film attacks.Consider isolated families in the pre-history.  What  other reproductive choice would they have?  Certainly it is better to  reproduce in the hope that the next generation might find partners.  This  evolutionary wisdom is what is captured here.  The sexual drive is seen as  stronger than society's ephemeral prejudices, and rightly so since our  genes must survive even when the society is stupid and self-destructive in  its mores.Birkin's direction lacks focus in the beginning and the  editing seems brilliant and disjointed by turns, but Birkin eschews even  the hint of a clich&eacute; and ends up with a slightly flawed, but engrossing,  strikingly original work of cinematic art.I'm disappointed that the  sound track did not include the seventies Motown tune, ""It's a Family  Affair.""",4,It's a family affair,962928000,"07 7, 2000",2000,2572,"['almost', 'heroic', 'honesty', 'urbanized', 'co-ed', 'Lord', 'Flies', '-ish', 'love', 'story', 'square', 'stone', 'house', 'isolated', 'island', 'jungle', 'familiar', 'setting', 'urban', 'sprawl', 'other', 'people', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'Birkin', 'adapting', 'Ian', 'McEwan', 'novel', 'Comfort', 'Strangers', 'screen', ""n't"", 'try', 'shock', 'just', 'prejudices', 'lets', 'fall', 'away', 'preconceptions', 'What', 'sense', 'liberation', 'usual', 'hypocrisy.The', 'love', 'story', 'acting', 'sister-brother', 'incest', 'almost', 'celebration', 'natural', 'what', 'fifteen-year-old', 'Jack', 'Andrew', 'Robertson', 'naked', 'embrace', 'older', 'sister', 'Julie', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'could', 'almost', 'buy', 'know', 'kibbutz', 'effect', 'was', 'found', 'unrelated', 'children', 'growing', 'up', 'together', 'virtually', 'never', 'married', 'one', 'sister', 'brother', 'grow', 'up', 'separately', 'can', 'be', 'sexual', 'excitement', 'grow', 'up', 'same', 'household', 'tend', 'find', 'other', 'sexually', 'boring', 'Family', 'members', 'usually', 'work', 'out', 'sexual', 'tension', 'play', 'early', 'age', 'time', 'are', 'sexually', 'mature', 'are', 'looking', 'elsewhere', 'how', 'incest', 'taboo', 'purpose', 'channel', 'sexual', 'drive', 'outward', 'better', 'mix', 'gene', 'pool', 'individual', 'incest', 'not', 'attractive', 'option', 'socially', 'economically', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'increase', 'one', 'family', 'influence', 'joining', 'someone', 'tribe', 'band', 'marry', 'sister', 'do', ""n't"", 'gain', 'brothers', 'Consequently', 'average', 'person', 'recoils', 'least', 'pretends', 'mere', 'suggestion', 'incest', 'mindless', 'knee', 'jerk', 'reaction', 'film', 'attacks.Consider', 'isolated', 'families', 'pre-history', 'What', 'other', 'reproductive', 'choice', 'would', 'have', 'Certainly', 'better', 'reproduce', 'hope', 'next', 'generation', 'might', 'find', 'partners', 'evolutionary', 'wisdom', 'what', 'captured', 'here', 'sexual', 'drive', 'seen', 'stronger', 'society', 'ephemeral', 'prejudices', 'rightly', 'so', 'genes', 'must', 'survive', 'even', 'when', 'society', 'stupid', 'self-destructive', 'mores.Birkin', 'direction', 'focus', 'beginning', 'editing', 'brilliant', 'disjointed', 'turns', 'Birkin', 'even', 'hint', 'clich', 'eacute', 'up', 'slightly', 'flawed', 'engrossing', 'strikingly', 'original', 'work', 'cinematic', 'art.I', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'sound', 'track', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'seventies', 'Motown', 'tune', 'Family', 'Affair']",The Cement Garden

It is noticeable that the actor playing Jack is over 15, (he's 17) but this is not an extreme problem. Jack is a little weird right from the start (he puts a new meaning to someone being in love with themselves) but we soon learn that his teenage sister Julie (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is not far behind in being weird, she just hides it better. After the death of both parents Tom also begins acting a little weird, but he is only 7. Sue may be the only normal child in the family, but since she is also the least shown of the children we may just not being seeing her abnormality.The plot of the movie is a subject which is normally taboo even for movies, so finding a movie which does such a great job of showing it is rare. To put it simply, after the death of their parents siblings Jack and Julie hide the death of their mother and take on the role of parents for their two younger siblings. By the end of the movie they go way to far in their role as a couple.The movie does contain a few nude scenes. Even though it is at night Jack is seen clearly from the front and rear as he runs around nude in the rain. There is also a long sequence where Jack and Tom are in bed together nude, which is also at night. Here both are seen nude from the side and rear, Tom holds a stuffed toy over his genitals in a small part of this sequence where his genitals would otherwise be seen. Jack is seen nude from the rear again, this time in good light, the following morning when Julie comes into the room and gets him up. At the end of the movie Julie and Jack are seen nude together, but only from the side and waist up from the front.Some of the reviews I read on Amazon.com complained about the video quality but I had no complaints about the video quality.

184886,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,1567301789,Only-A-Child,"[2, 7]","Aspiring production designers and location scouts should take note of ""The Cement Garden"" (1993) as an example of especially good use of an available on-the-cheap location. Like the equally low-budget ""Carnival of Souls"", the film owes much of its effectiveness to the creative use of an available location. ""The Cement Garden's"" outdoor shots should look familiar as Stanley Kubrick used the location back in 1987 for the main battle sequence of ""Full Metal Jacket"". He used the abandoned Beckton Gasworks just across from the Royal Docks area (Beckton-Silverton London). The area has now been transformed into London City Airport.As a film, ""The Cement Garden"" could best be described as pretentious (marked by an unwarranted claim to importance or distinction). It is a movie that tries embarrassingly hard to be more than the sum of its parts. The strategy is to introduce shocking and scandalous elements in such a casual way that it will amp up the effect of breaking taboos far beyond what they would otherwise merit. This too owes much to Kubrick (insert ""Lolita"" here).""The Cement Garden"" is what you would get if Gregg Araki remade ""Our Mother's House"" on a shoestring budget; although it is safe to say Araki would have done a much better job of acting for the camera direction.  It is an adaptation of Ian McEwan's controversial novel, but as the adapting was done by Director Andrew Birkin (later to be blamed for ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" script), the result is likely to be disappointing to readers of McEwan's book.I can't actually recommend the film although some viewers will enjoy and/or be shocked by it. It somehow manages to be both melodramatic and boring; I found viewing possible only in 20 minute segments (not so much because it was painful but because it was not involving enough for me to ignore household interruptions). Since the macabre elements aren't particularly shocking (just a couple of stylish ""Blue Velvet"" type shots), Birkin must fall back on incest and gender identity. It is one perversion too many and there is no logical connection between the two.The story is about a family of six (mother, father, two daughters and two sons). The older son is meant to look like a girl, the older daughter is meant to look like a boy, and the younger son wants to be a girl. The mother's death occurs a few weeks after the father, and the children conceal her death in an effort to stay together.The story is told from the point of view of the oldest boy, who is turned on by his own reflection and by his tease of an older sister. Since he looks so much more feminine than her, his sexual orientation may actually be straight. The younger sister (who is not involved in any of this) looks perfectly normal but spends a lot of time writing letters to her dead mother.Like ""Our Mother's House"" (a far better film), an older man is inserted into the story in an effort to make something happen. While a little hard to decipher, the basic themes concern the problems associated with assuming responsibilities before you are emotionally mature enough for them.In fairness, an attempt is made to insert an allegorical element into the film, as the older boy frequently does a voice-over reading of a science fiction story. This is meant to reflect his internal moral struggles but the connection with the events of the story is rather fuzzy. Not surprising since the weak direction builds neither suspense nor convincing characters. But at least there is that great production design.Then again, what do I know?

184888,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,1567301789,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 4]","The Cement Garden (Andrew Birkin, 1993)There's a book, and it seems that where there's a book, there's a movie. It is the case that at least ninety-five, some would say closer to ninety-nine percent of the time, the movie is just not as good as the book. I tend to be a bit more liberal than most in that regard, but in this case, while the movie's decent, it has nothing on McEwan's stunning first novel.Jack (Gormenghast's Andrew Robertson), Julie (Charlotte Gainsbourg, soon to star in the highly anticipated Have Mercy on Us All, based on Fred Vargas' smash hit novel), Sue (Alice Coulthard, in her only screen appearance), and Tom (Ned Birkin, also in his only screen appearance) are four kids living in England. Their father (Munich's Hanns Zischler) dies of a heart attack, and soon after, their mother (Sinead Cusack, recently of V for Vendetta) becomes mysteriously ill. She knows she's dying, and attempts to do as much as she can to make sure the children can survive on their own after her death. The children attempt to do so, in a sort of Lord of the Flies meets The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane way, until Julie gets herself a beau, Derek (veteran TV actor Jochen Horst), which throws Jack-- whose feelings for Julie have become increasingly complex-- into a crisis.The main difference between the novel and the film is that the kids' mother dies much earlier on in the novel than she does in the film, and so the whole thematic thrust of the novel is forced into roughly half the movie's hour and forty-five minute running time. There's not much chance to do much development there; Birkin chooses to content himself with abbreviating the development of the themes that are birthed when the children start living on their own, and develop those start while everyone's still living as a family. The result isn't a bad film, by any means, but those who have read the novel are likely to find it lacking. Still, there's something about Birkin stocking a film with incestuous undercurrents with his own nieces and nephews that cannot help but invite all sorts of speculation, and there's certainly something to be said for any film that shows off the gorgeous Charlotte Gainsbourg in all her glory. An interesting artifact, but no matter why you're watching it, you're likely to get more out of the book. ** ",3,"The book it ain't, but it has some redeeming qualities.",1149638400,"06 7, 2006",2006,2327,"['Cement', 'Garden', 'Andrew', 'Birkin', '1993', 'book', 'where', 'book', 'movie', 'case', 'least', 'ninety-five', 'would', 'say', 'closer', 'ninety-nine', 'percent', 'time', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'liberal', 'most', 'regard', 'case', 'movie', 'decent', 'nothing', 'McEwan', 'stunning', 'first', 'novel.Jack', 'Gormenghast', 'Andrew', 'Robertson', 'Julie', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'soon', 'star', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'Have', 'Mercy', 'Us', 'All', 'based', 'Fred', 'Vargas', 'smash', 'hit', 'novel', 'Sue', 'Alice', 'Coulthard', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'Tom', 'Ned', 'Birkin', 'also', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'are', 'four', 'kids', 'living', 'England', 'father', 'Munich', 'Hanns', 'Zischler', 'heart', 'attack', 'soon', 'mother', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'recently', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'mysteriously', 'ill.', 'dying', 'attempts', 'do', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'make', 'sure', 'children', 'can', 'survive', 'own', 'death', 'children', 'attempt', 'do', 'so', 'sort', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Down', 'Lane', 'way', 'Julie', 'beau', 'Derek', 'veteran', 'TV', 'actor', 'Jochen', 'Horst', 'Jack', 'feelings', 'Julie', 'have', 'become', 'increasingly', 'complex', 'crisis.The', 'main', 'difference', 'novel', 'film', 'kids', 'mother', 'dies', 'much', 'earlier', 'novel', 'film', 'so', 'whole', 'thematic', 'thrust', 'novel', 'forced', 'roughly', 'movie', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'not', 'much', 'chance', 'do', 'much', 'development', 'there', 'Birkin', 'content', 'abbreviating', 'development', 'themes', 'are', 'birthed', 'when', 'children', 'start', 'living', 'own', 'develop', 'start', 'everyone', 'still', 'living', 'family', 'result', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'means', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'lacking', 'Still', 'something', 'Birkin', 'stocking', 'film', 'incestuous', 'undercurrents', 'own', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'invite', 'sorts', 'speculation', 'certainly', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'glory', 'interesting', 'artifact', 'matter', 'why', ""'re"", 'watching', ""'re"", 'likely', 'get', 'more', 'book', '**']",The Cement Garden

For fear that their younger brother and sister will have to go to an orphanage (in much the same vein as Jacques Fansten's &quot;Cross My Heart&quot;), the two bury their mother's body in a vat of cement in the cellar and proceed to take on their parents roles. While Sue, the youngest sister, deals with her pain through writing, and Tom (the younger brother, played by the director's son) begins dressing in girl's clothing, the tension between Jack and Julie builds toward an inevitable and highly anticipated climax.
