That being said, I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it to most viewers who like creepy stories. It does not agree with my religious beliefs, but the story is well presented with good acting and realistic sets. Having watched it twice now, the movie kept me equally on the edge of my seat for both viewings.  Some may find the pacing slow, but to me that helps to build the suspense.  The ending is excellent -- I've watched just the end at least 6 times. I found the ideas presented in the film to thought-provoking and in some ways in line with some things that I believe.

Getting it home, I popped it in my DVD player and began watching the movie. I expected the worst. Lo and behold, it turned out to be a pretty dadgummed good movie(especially one that was released straight-to-DVD). See, the movie is about two paramedics that answer a call from a young girl whose mother has lost consciousness in a deserted area. They soon find out answering that call was a big mistake. Kidnapped and locked in an isolated building by a doomsday cult, one of the paramedics tries to discover the truth behind a secret cult and their beliefs. Therein, the other paramedic's beliefs are challenged and the line between religion and scientific thinking are crossed. Both must find a way to escape, but only one does. The Believers explores the manipulative measures some cults use to take advantage of those who are lost. What surprised me was the ending. I really wasn't expecting it, honestly. Do I recommend it? Most definitely. It's the best Straight-to-DVD movie I've seen in quite sometime.

1087251,ABS2A1OWX5Q8,B000SQDS6E,Fred Adelman,"[0, 0]","BELIEVERS (2007) - Paramedics David (Johnny Messner; ANACONDAS: THE HUNT FOR THE BLOOD ORCHID - 2004) and Victor (Jon Huertas; THE INSATIABLE - 2006) answer a call of a woman passed out on Lake Road and when they get there, they find the woman, Rebecca (Deanna Russo), unresponsive, as her young daughter, Libby (Saige Ryan Campbell), screams at them to wake her up before &#34;they&#34; arrive. As David and Victor work to revive Rebecca (she has strange mathematical equations tattooed on her body), four men in white coats carrying guns pull up in a pickup truck, grab Rebecca and Libby and kidnap David and Victor, putting a bullet in Victor's shoulder to show they mean business. They are taken to a heavily guarded compound (actually a deserted missile base) of a cult of wackos called the Quanta Group, where David and Victor are &#34;decontaminated&#34; and questioned by a dweeb called IO (Erik Passoja), who informs them that in thirteen hours everyone in the cult will leave Earth to &#34;perpetuate the species&#34;. David and Victor are then locked in bathroom stalls, as we watch the Quanta Group's leader, Dr. Talbot (Daniel Benzali; MESSENGER OF DEATH - 1988), also known as &#34;The Teacher&#34;, using some psychic force on Rebecca's body in an attempt to revive her, but Libby tries to intervene (&#34;You don't touch the Teacher!&#34;) and is locked in the same bathroom as David and Victor. Libby tells them that the Teacher is taking them to the other side of the universe, but they all have to go to sleep first. Thinking that everything is going to turn out like the Heaven's Gate mass suicide, David and Victor try to find a way to escape, especially when a seemingly-cured Rebecca shows up in the bathroom and offers to take them on their trip. Meanwhile, David and Victor's boss, Capt. Newsome (Dig Wayne), and David's pregnant wife Deborah (Elizabeth Bogush), try to locate them, but the Quanta Group have people on the outside covering up the evidence. The Teacher informs our captive pair that the Earth will cease to exist in a matter of weeks and offers to &#34;save&#34; them. The Teacher has a &#34;formula&#34; (&#34;Numbers don't lie. People do.&#34;) that proves &#34;a rain of fire will decend from above, incinerating all life on Earth&#34; and explains to David and Victor that the Quanta Group, made up of scientists, researchers and philosophers, are the only people that will escape the Armageddon. The Teacher has knowledge of both David and Victor's lives that he can't possibly know about and it affects both David and Victor in very different ways (Victor is a devout Catholic and David is an Athiest). Is it possible that the Quanta Group is not a cult at all, but actually humanity's last chance for survival? I'm afraid you'll have to discover that for yourself. Let's just say that the ending is a killer.  Slow-moving, yet never uninvolving, BELIEVERS is a taut tale of people who either believe or refuse to, not just about the end of the world, but also in God itself. Director Daniel Myrick (co-director of the cult smash THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT [1999] and director of the horror films SOLSTICE [2007] and THE OBJECTIVE [2007]), working with a screenplay written by himself, Daniel Noah and Julia Fair (ALIEN RAIDERS - 2008), has fashioned a religious allegory disguised as a sci-fi thriller, a modern-day take on the Rapture. Myrick keeps us guessing whether the Quanta Group and the Teacher himself are real or just another brainwashing, mind-control cult with false doomsday prophecies. The scene where Rebecca seduces and the makes love to Victor while she repeats verbatim every word the Teacher (who has a Control Room full of TV's, where he can monitor every room in the compound) whispers in her ear (thanks to a small microphone implanted in her skull) is an example of how this film plays with audiences' expectations. The Believers think that the Teacher has real powers, while the non-believers will think it is nothing but a susceptible woman hypnotizing (by proxy) a man whose will has been weakened. In the end, it all boils down to the differences in David and Victor's backgrounds and those differences play a major role in how they react to the situation. While the film is not that bloody, there are extremely uncomfortable scenes, such as when David is &#34;purged&#34; with a car battery. The ambient soundtrack, full of low-range rumbles, electronic blips and whispering voices, adds to the creepy atmosphere. Though not for everyone's tastes, BELIEVERS is a seriously deranged take on how religion can be used for evil as well as good and how the best of intentions can come back and bite you in the ass.

1087252,AY12DBB0U420B,B000SQDS6E,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Believers,"" a direct-to-DVD movie. Had I known that, I probably wouldn't have bought it as these kinds of DVDs have low reputations. However, it turned out that this is not a bad movie at all. It had a couple major flaws in the script that needed to be corrected and weren't and I will mention them later. This movie had all the marks of a low-budget quickie. The sets were whatever they could find that needed little modification. The photography was marginal. The background sound was so distractingly poor that the movie would have been better without it. However, the acting was reasonably good and the story, modeled after the ""Heaven's Gate"" fiasco, was reasonably good and held the attention. It's billed as a horror film, but it wasn't. Violence and gore were at an absolute minimum. Here and there the language was foul, but it fit the situation.The story involved two paramedics who got an emergency call to save a woman who evidently had a heart attack and was accompanied by her little girl at a remote filling station. They arrived and tried to save her but were almost immediately captured by several men in a pickup truck who took all of them to a nearby living area which looked somewhat like it might be an old abandoned manufacturing plant. It was the living quarters for a cult known as The Quantum Group and the leader was known as The Teacher. Obviously, the model was Heaven's Gate, and the group was awaiting their departure for the other side of the universe in somewhat the same manner as the Heaven's Gaters. They decided to take the paramedics along with them, as an act of kindness, to rescue them from the impending end of the Earth. I'd tend to regard the whole thing as drivel and complete nonsense, except that I live only about 20 miles from the Heaven's Gate quarters and I watched that one unfold to everyone's horror and utter surprise. In any case, the paramedics managed to escape and the whole transport thing broke down as the deadline arrived, unlike Heaven's Gate.Well, it was a somewhat gripping story and not badly done at all. I view it as having two rather bad flaws. One was having the heart-attack woman mysteriously coming back to life and playing a major role. Sorry, but that one just ruined a major part of the story for me. Second, the ending (about the last two minutes) was just awful. Surely, they could have done better. You know, if it weren't for these two major flaws I might have actually given this low-budget quickie five stars.Gary Peterson",4,A Low-Budget Quickie That's Surprisingly Good.,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,2541,"['Last', 'night', 'bargain-rack', 'movie', 'was', 'Believers', 'direct-to-DVD', 'movie', 'Had', 'known', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'kinds', 'DVDs', 'have', 'low', 'reputations', 'However', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'had', 'couple', 'major', 'flaws', 'script', 'needed', 'be', 'corrected', 'were', ""n't"", 'will', 'mention', 'later', 'movie', 'had', 'marks', 'low-budget', 'quickie', 'sets', 'were', 'whatever', 'could', 'find', 'needed', 'little', 'modification', 'photography', 'was', 'marginal', 'background', 'sound', 'was', 'so', 'distractingly', 'poor', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'However', 'acting', 'was', 'reasonably', 'good', 'story', 'modeled', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'fiasco', 'was', 'reasonably', 'good', 'held', 'attention', 'billed', 'horror', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'Violence', 'gore', 'were', 'absolute', 'minimum', 'Here', 'there', 'language', 'was', 'foul', 'fit', 'situation.The', 'story', 'involved', 'two', 'paramedics', 'who', 'got', 'emergency', 'call', 'save', 'woman', 'who', 'evidently', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'was', 'accompanied', 'little', 'girl', 'remote', 'filling', 'station', 'arrived', 'tried', 'save', 'were', 'almost', 'immediately', 'captured', 'several', 'men', 'pickup', 'truck', 'who', 'took', 'nearby', 'living', 'area', 'looked', 'somewhat', 'might', 'be', 'old', 'abandoned', 'manufacturing', 'plant', 'was', 'living', 'quarters', 'cult', 'known', 'Quantum', 'Group', 'leader', 'was', 'known', 'Teacher', 'Obviously', 'model', 'was', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'group', 'was', 'awaiting', 'departure', 'other', 'side', 'universe', 'somewhat', 'same', 'manner', 'Heaven', 'Gaters', 'decided', 'take', 'paramedics', 'act', 'kindness', 'rescue', 'impending', 'end', 'Earth', ""'d"", 'tend', 'regard', 'whole', 'thing', 'drivel', 'complete', 'nonsense', 'live', 'only', 'about', '20', 'miles', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'quarters', 'watched', 'one', 'unfold', 'everyone', 'horror', 'utter', 'surprise', 'case', 'paramedics', 'managed', 'escape', 'whole', 'transport', 'thing', 'broke', 'down', 'deadline', 'arrived', 'Heaven', 'Gate.Well', 'was', 'somewhat', 'gripping', 'story', 'not', 'badly', 'done', 'view', 'having', 'two', 'rather', 'bad', 'flaws', 'One', 'was', 'having', 'heart-attack', 'woman', 'mysteriously', 'coming', 'back', 'life', 'playing', 'major', 'role', 'Sorry', 'one', 'just', 'ruined', 'major', 'part', 'story', 'Second', 'ending', 'last', 'two', 'minutes', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'Surely', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'know', 'were', ""n't"", 'two', 'major', 'flaws', 'might', 'have', 'actually', 'given', 'low-budget', 'quickie', 'five', 'stars.Gary', 'Peterson']",Believers

Daniel Myrick was involved w. The Blair Witch Project.  He directed this film.  Personally I didnt care much for BWP; the grainy handheld camera thing to give the appearance of a documentary was an interesting idea but there was way too much camera-motion for me, and the plot seemed a little lame.  Let me assure you this is a much stronger film.  It has some of the same elements: grainy film quality, frequently dim lighting, a lot of viewing monitoring-camera images and things like that.  However there is no presense of it being a ""documentary""; this is a straight-up fictional film.  Really I wouldn't describe it exactly as a ""horror"" movie, although it's close.  I found it more like a suspense film in which I was more interested in what was coming next, but not actually scared.  Nor is it a particularly violent film.  There's no depiction of actual murder or dismemberment, nor any unbelievably ""occult"" phenomena.  It's a GREAT portrayal of cult mentality, but as the film unfolds the main question is--what's going to turn out real and what's unreal?  Ie the cult has this notion the world is about to end and they alone have the formula to escape in time and propagate humanity on another world.  Of course, just like the real ""Heaven's Gate"" cult, escaping the end of the world usually means escaping your life too--ie, group suicide.  But the leader has an uncanny ability to know things about other people, and purportedly the ""cult"" has mathematicians and scientists, and their explanation for their knowledge is all based on mathematics.  So-are they RIGHT, or are they just another whacko group with a charismatic leader?  And will they take down the 2 paramedics who get trapped unwittingly in their facilty by unhappy circumstance, or will they escape alive?  That's the basic dramatic tension of the film.  The acting is pretty good, the filming pretty good, the storyline good, and as long as you view it expecting just a suspenseful fictional story I think you'll be very pleased.  Why the ""unrated"" rating? Im just guessing the studio first planned to release it in theatre with an ""R"" rating, but ended up throwing it straight to DVD without an official rating.  Actually it's more tame than many ""R"" films.  PS there are many subtle and semi-subtle allusions in the film-like a swipe at Scientology right at the beginning, or the name of the second-in-command, ""Io"".  Sounds like Greek mythology, or the name of a moon, right?  Well in binary code that's the number 2, and he's the number 2 man of this organization.  Lots of little things like that, not all of which an audience will even catch going on.  Not much in the way of special features, but a few nice extended/deleted scenes.

1087259,A3SU3TXON36T0X,B000SQDS6E,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""","[6, 11]","_Believers_ (2007) is an exceedingly strange film directed by Daniel Myrick which focuses on a bizarre organization which some believe may be a cult referred to as the Quanta Group.  The film opens with a member of this group speaking for his organization and attempting to rebut claims that this group is a cult.  This individual claims that the Quanta Group is based on ""science and not blind faith"" and that ""the Teacher"" holds the key to the mysteries of the universe.  The film then focuses on two paramedics who are sent to investigate the mother of a young girl who is unconscious.  While attempting to aid this woman, the paramedics are taken hostage by this cult.  Subsequently they are interrogated and told that they must wait for the Teacher.  The Teacher has an uncanny ability to understand the thoughts and mind of both of the paramedics and knows information about them which they believe he could not possibly know.  Ultimately the movie features a conflict between belief in the cult and the commonplace beliefs of those in the outside world.  Surprisingly, the movie ends disturbingly with a cult suicide; however, the predictions of the Teacher may turn out to be more accurate than at first believed.In the film, the Quanta Group is portrayed as a cult similar to the Heaven's Gate believers who committed mass suicide with the coming of the comet Hale-Bopp.  It remains to be determined exactly what the Quanta Group really is and whether or not they are indeed a cult as suggested by the movie.  Apparently they claim to be a group of elite scientists who have unraveled the mysteries of the universe.
