Unfortunately, in the screenwriter's apparent desire to put as many unexpected, even quirky, turns in the story as possible, he forgot that a story is supposed to be appealing.  A few moments were.  Most were either routine daytime soap-opera material or just boring.Also, the casting was incredible.  It's as though someone tried to win the prize for who could cast the largest number of unappealing actors and actresses in a single movie.  There were one or two exceptions, like Margaret Colin, but the other eight or ten--or however many there were--ranged from off-putting to repulsive.Apparently, a number of people liked this movie, so maybe you will too.  I don't really understand why.  I like a good human-interest story.
