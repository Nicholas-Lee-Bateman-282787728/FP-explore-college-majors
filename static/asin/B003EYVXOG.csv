It's refreshing to see middle-aged actors... starring as lovers. David Duchovny is still hot (I was a bigThe X-Files: The Complete Collector's Editionfan back in the '90s) Demi Moore shows she's able to star in a serious movie, not just a Charlie's Angel remake or a blasphemous Scarlet Letter remake. Duchovny and Moore star as a fake couple;they're marketers in disguise. Their son and daughter aren't really theirs. The comedy makes great points about materialism, greed, and consumerism. It also takes pot shots at societal narcissism. Duchovny and Moore have to learn to discard their false selves to embrace their real ones, especially when they learn that their daughter is romancing a married man, and their son is gay. It's about embracing the Truth.

1339161,AHN86VFJIJ2JP,B003EYVXOG,Chicago Book Addict,"[2, 6]","The Joneses basically establishes itself as dramatic commentary on our current consumer society.  Basically, it's about a group of people hired to act as a wealthy family.  Their job is to pursuade their new friends and neighbors to buy the products their marketing agency is pushing, ranging from luxury cars to perfume to frozen food.  Essentially they take the current model of word of mouth and make it bigger and more high stakes.As someone who works in advertising, I found myself curious about the premise.  Sadly, the movie did not live up to it whatsoever.  The plot is far fetched to begin with as from a business model a company would NEVER be able to sell enough product based on this model to justify hiring people to do this or providing them free product in order to do so.  There are also so many details about how their jobs play out that seem incredibly implausable.  Yes, many movies are a little over the top so I am not faulting this movie entirely for its lack of realism.  But I don't think they made any attempts to make the premise plausable.Additionally, I think because the story line was weak, it made it even more difficult to overlook the lack of realism.  Basically the story follows the negative impact their jobs have on their new friends, their struggles between who they really are and the characters they portray, and of course a dash of romance.  The problem is it is all very easy to predict and what drama is there is dragged out in such a way that the movie seems boring and drawn out.Overall I found this movie to be awful and admittedly only watched it in full because I was on a plane.

1339162,A11ZESNK9JXTHR,B003EYVXOG,Coffee Klatch Reviews,"[10, 11]","I hate to give this movie only three stars because I agree strongly with its message and admired its aspirations.The Joneses is about a family (David Duchovny, Demi Moore, Amber Heard, Ben Hollingsworth) that moves into town. They're a beautiful family, a perfect family, with cool children and all the right products. So of course, seeing them, you naturally want what they have, you want to be them, and how better to be them than to buy the products they own, which they will so gladly and frequently tell you about.If you've heard of stealth marketing (e.g., where popular high school students are given products by a company so that other less popular students will see this and also want the same product) you will figure out within the first few minutes of the film what the story is about. And you will be way ahead of the filmmakers, who continue to reveal the information in a way that shows they don't realize you've gotten it.The movie is also about the neighbors (Gary Cole, Glenne Headly), who represent all of us, and who fall for the ruse, with tragic consequences.This movie has the aspirations of a Truman Show or of a great novel. It tries to add some complexity into the mix by showing how human needs and motivations can disrupt even the best corporate schemes. It creates many admirable questions: In a society based on capitalism can you trust that the salesperson or even your neighbor is telling you the truth? Those products you see your neighbors using: did they even pay for those with their own money? Why do we allow corporations to do this? How is it some people are willing to lie and manipulate others so ruthlessly? What are the consequences to society of allowing our corporations to engage in this behavior?But those aspirations are only partly achieved. The motivations of the characters are not filled in, as if the movie were taken from a novel and had not enough screen time to do the characters justice. The cathartic moments aren't cathartic because they haven't been set up properly and the chemistry between Duchovny and Moore is unconvincing. The tragedies are more paint-by-numbers than actually creating any emotion in the audience.So, the movie is about capitalism and stealth marketing. But, finally, it's also about us: Do we have the intelligence, integrity, and strength to neither contribute to, nor fall for, the constant and ever-evolving forms of corporate manipulation?Three stars.",3,"High aspirations, but only moderate success",1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,2438,"['hate', 'give', 'movie', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'agree', 'strongly', 'message', 'admired', 'aspirations.The', 'Joneses', 'family', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'Ben', 'Hollingsworth', 'town', ""'re"", 'beautiful', 'family', 'perfect', 'family', 'cool', 'children', 'right', 'products', 'course', 'seeing', 'naturally', 'want', 'what', 'have', 'want', 'be', 'how', 'better', 'be', 'buy', 'products', 'own', 'will', 'so', 'gladly', 'frequently', 'tell', 'about.If', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'stealth', 'marketing', 'e.g.', 'where', 'popular', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'are', 'given', 'products', 'company', 'so', 'other', 'less', 'popular', 'students', 'will', 'see', 'also', 'want', 'same', 'product', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'what', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'way', 'ahead', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'continue', 'reveal', 'information', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'it.The', 'movie', 'also', 'neighbors', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Glenne', 'Headly', 'who', 'represent', 'who', 'fall', 'ruse', 'tragic', 'consequences.This', 'movie', 'aspirations', 'Truman', 'Show', 'great', 'novel', 'add', 'complexity', 'mix', 'showing', 'how', 'human', 'needs', 'motivations', 'can', 'disrupt', 'even', 'best', 'corporate', 'schemes', 'many', 'admirable', 'questions', 'society', 'based', 'capitalism', 'can', 'trust', 'salesperson', 'even', 'neighbor', 'telling', 'truth', 'products', 'see', 'neighbors', 'using', 'did', 'even', 'pay', 'own', 'money', 'Why', 'do', 'allow', 'corporations', 'do', 'How', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'lie', 'manipulate', 'others', 'so', 'ruthlessly', 'What', 'are', 'consequences', 'society', 'allowing', 'corporations', 'engage', 'behavior', 'aspirations', 'are', 'only', 'partly', 'achieved', 'motivations', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'filled', 'movie', 'were', 'taken', 'novel', 'had', 'not', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'do', 'characters', 'justice', 'cathartic', 'moments', 'are', ""n't"", 'cathartic', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'set', 'up', 'properly', 'chemistry', 'Duchovny', 'Moore', 'unconvincing', 'tragedies', 'are', 'more', 'paint-by-numbers', 'actually', 'creating', 'emotion', 'audience.So', 'movie', 'capitalism', 'stealth', 'marketing', 'finally', 'also', 'Do', 'have', 'intelligence', 'integrity', 'strength', 'contribute', 'fall', 'constant', 'ever-evolving', 'forms', 'corporate', 'manipulation', 'Three', 'stars']",N/A

Yet early on, we really don't know what Steve does for a living (he plays a lot of golf), plus we know Kate really enjoys being pampered at the finest salons and spas, while Jenn and Mick are the mutual hits at their new high school.

I thought it was worth watching, entertaining enough to keep me interested. Maybe it was just Demi or David who held my interest? I do know that having lived in that type of neighborhood  that there is some bite to this movie. What was difficult for me was looking back after my husband died at the life we had and how hard he worked to give it to me, I can say I miss the really nice things that he made possible for me to have but I would go every day for the rest of my life without anything just to have him back.  He died 4 years ago from Cancer.  I saw my own family as well as my husbands go through different stages of jealousy as time passed and we moved into Custom Homes, Drove Mercedes, had a Pool and all the things that go with building a Custom Home very similar to the one's in this film. At the end of the day when my husband died his brother and my sister took everything that they could get their hands on, from ""all my husband's suits, nice coats etc. even his Brief case, while my sister was stealing all the jewelry, perfume, make up and clothes that they could carry out of the house in addition to what they were shipping to their homes.They were so jealous that they stooped to stealing.  Little do they know all those things are not important when it comes to losing the husband you loved f or 27 years.  Greed is a powerful thing.

Although they give all the trappings of an intact family, they are really just there to get their new neighbors to want (and buy) all the expensive gadgets (from their sporty car to Steve's top-of-the-line golf clubs) they ""own."" Kate has been through this before. In fact, this is her fifth ""husband."" This is Steve's first go at it. Although he starts out slowly, Steve, a former (but failed) golf pro and car salesman, impresses his friends so well that he soon becomes the best merchandise peddler of the four of them.In fact, he becomes too great a persuader. His next-door neighbor (played by Gary Cole) is so convinced that Steve's lifestyle is leading to happiness that he tries desperately to keep up with him, buying everything that Steve suggests and more. Unfortunately, he takes on incredible debt, falling behind on his house payments and his credit cards, and is soon headed for financial disaster.Meanwhile, the ""daughter"" (played by Amber Heard) has an affair with a married man, one that comes to an end when his wife finds out and he unceremoniously dumps her. At the same time, Steve and Kate do the unthinkable. They actually begin to be attracted to each other, which clouds their judgment as marketers.The concept behind the movie is great, although its point is rather obvious and can be summed up in a sentence: People want to keep up with the Joneses and will go to any extreme to do so. ""The Joneses"" does a tolerably good job of showing this.The ending (which for obvious reasons I will not divulge) is perhaps the most disappointing moment of the film, not because it's not a happy ending. It is. However, it's rather predictable, and given the negative impact the Joneses have had on various members of the community, is incongruous.",4,An interesting concept,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,2069,"['Joneses', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'family', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'something', 'evident', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Kate', 'Moore', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'two', 'teenage', 'children', 'moving', 'largest', 'house', 'extremely', 'upscale', 'neighborhood', 'give', 'trappings', 'intact', 'family', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'there', 'get', 'new', 'neighbors', 'want', 'buy', 'expensive', 'gadgets', 'sporty', 'car', 'Steve', 'top-of-the-line', 'golf', 'clubs', 'own', 'Kate', 'been', 'before', 'fact', 'fifth', 'husband', 'Steve', 'first', 'go', 'out', 'slowly', 'Steve', 'former', 'failed', 'golf', 'pro', 'car', 'salesman', 'friends', 'so', 'well', 'soon', 'best', 'merchandise', 'peddler', 'four', 'them.In', 'fact', 'too', 'great', 'persuader', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'played', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'so', 'convinced', 'Steve', 'lifestyle', 'leading', 'happiness', 'desperately', 'keep', 'up', 'buying', 'everything', 'Steve', 'more', 'Unfortunately', 'incredible', 'debt', 'falling', 'house', 'payments', 'credit', 'cards', 'soon', 'headed', 'financial', 'disaster.Meanwhile', 'daughter', 'played', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'affair', 'married', 'man', 'one', 'end', 'when', 'wife', 'out', 'unceremoniously', 'same', 'time', 'Steve', 'Kate', 'do', 'unthinkable', 'actually', 'begin', 'be', 'attracted', 'other', 'clouds', 'judgment', 'marketers.The', 'concept', 'movie', 'great', 'point', 'rather', 'obvious', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'sentence', 'People', 'want', 'keep', 'up', 'Joneses', 'will', 'go', 'extreme', 'do', 'so', 'Joneses', 'tolerably', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'this.The', 'ending', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'will', 'not', 'divulge', 'perhaps', 'most', 'disappointing', 'moment', 'film', 'not', 'not', 'happy', 'ending', 'However', 'rather', 'predictable', 'given', 'negative', 'impact', 'Joneses', 'have', 'had', 'various', 'members', 'community', 'incongruous']",N/A

Sorel ""book lovah""","[0, 0]","I watched this film while I was home sick (which is when I get to watch most movies) and have to say that I was pleasantly surprised! It was limited to only limited theaters and went quickly to DVD which made me a bit leery. However, I found this movie to be quite timely and a fantastic idea overall.The film follows Kate and Steve Jones as they move into a new town with ""their children"" Jen and Mick. The family assimilates easily into the upper class neighborhood and they instantly make friends. Well, perhaps friends is to strong a word for Kate, Steve, Jen, and Mick are not a real family. It is quickly revealed to the viewer that they are in fact a ""unit"" or ""cell"" that moves into a neighborhood to hawk luxury merchandise to their ""friends"" (or rather the people around them). Jen and Mick play the part of the popular high school students who everyone wants to be like while their ""parents"" play the couple that everyone loves and admires. Together the unit's sales skyrocket until things take a more sinister turn and their wheeling and dealing finally catches up with them.I thought that the acting was wonderful. There were times that the script seemed a bit fluffy but overall the film was very affective. I found the concept enthralling and though I think that were some ways to make the film better it still held my attention and exposed how keeping up with the Joneses is detrimental to all involved.

And because the truth hurts.This movie is about a family, that is much like many families of current times. This movie shows reality. This movie shows why many people are in their current circumstances.This movies show why you should not covet anyone on anything. You get to see what coveting gets you.Great lessons can be learned from this movie. Many things may glitter but do they really have value?We own this movie and use it a reminder to remain humble, and keep people first, and to love people first and not fall into the trap of consumerism. To be great stewards over what the Lord has provided and not to get caught up into this material world.Take a look around and see all the materialism. Look at how all it take is for someone to purchase something, show it off and then every one wants it. Watch the Ethos DVD, you can purchase that DVD here on Amazon.We have cut down on our consumerism in many ways, cutting cable off, (we use Roku and Logitech revue Google T.V. to stream, antenna T.V, with Moho antenna to view T.V.) growing our on veggies, the use of magic jack or Nettalk for phone service, no smart cell phones for a household of more than six (my husband is the only one who has a smart cell phone due to his job). Cooking at home and much much more. This movie is confirmation that we have made the right steps and will continue to make the right steps in this direction. We have more quality time, and a much better more free lifestyle. We also save much more without a cable bill and smart phone data packages that everyone has to have now days. Our sell phone bill is way less than $200 for five phones.

1339173,A3CALY5BP8OQ9C,B003EYVXOG,Infinite Loop,"[1, 3]","I didn't watch the film -- didn't have to --  the 5-star reviewers told me everything I need to know. The plot sounds like a rip-off from the far-superior Truman Show (I see one writer already caught this).  The underlying premise here is that good old fashioned capitalism is bad; it's capitalism that turns us all into a bunch of consumer zombies incapable of self discipline and control. Why is it the fault of &#34;evil&#34; corporations every time some idiot overspends on their credit card trying to feed a mindless addiction to satisfy the endless emotional vacancies in their lives?And exactly who makes all the stuff the Jones are try to sell to their neighbors?  PEOPLE!  People like me, like my friends and, yes, like my neighbors.  We all have jobs, we all make money and, in turn, we all go out and buy stuff. That's what money ultimately is for -- to buy stuff.  I'm a thinking person capable of making my own rational decisions; I don't buy a particular car just because it looks cool and my next door neighbor happens to owns one; I live for the sake of MY life, not to impress my neighbor.Without having seen this film, I'm already applauding the Joneses!  They may be marketing tools, but they're honest and know exactly what they're doing; it's the neighbors who are the dishonest fakes as they try to elevate themselves to social acceptance without having to earn it.  The &#34;neighbors&#34; depicted in this film are representative of spineless and lazy people incapable of living their own lives -- they exist only to serve others.At no time in history has humankind ever enjoyed the kind of material wealth available to virtually everyone today. In the United States even the poorest have televisions and carry cell phones. Your average working stiff has access to products and services today that didn't even exist 20 years ago, you couldn't obtain them a any price. We're all consumers and consumer-ISM&#34; is a good thing!  Consumerism is the handmaiden of capitalism; consumerism creates jobs not just in the U.S. but other countries as well. Consumerism gave us GPS, Google, Facebook, iPads, iPhones, HD TV, Amazon, the Internet, Walmart, McDonald's, Lowes, Best Buy, on-line shopping, fiber-optic cable, satellite-based commercial radio, on and on.  One could just have easily made a similar statement back in the 1920's; different technologies but same results.  Back then, people got hooked on buying stuff &#34;on-time&#34;, on credit. At first it was houses, then cars, then washing machines, then electric irons; virtually every dollar they made went to a debt collector to pay for all the stuff they couldn't afford in the first place.  Back then the banks were the enemy, banks were evil institutions run by evil people like Mr. Potter (It's A Wonderful Life).  Then came the Great Depression, you lost your job then your house, your car, your washing machine and even that wonderful electric iron.  Sound familiar?Of course it was all the fault of capitalism and those greedy bankers. During the 1930's socialism and communism became all the rage among the disenfranchised working class along with groups of bored restless college students from wealthy families; one was supposed to be apologetic for having financially security even if they earned it by their own labor. And, ultimately, without having actually watched this film, that's the crux of the plot -- the eternal guilt trip we're all supposed to endure for the act of being wealthy.Have you EVER seen ANY film from Hollywood praising success and the wealth that followed?  Wealth is supposed to be the product of greed, not just any greed, but corporate greed. All wealthy people go that way at other people's expense; that's what we've been told from the day we first entered Kindergarten to the day we graduated from college.  Is it not ironic that the actors making these movies are among the wealthiest people in America if not the world?Which brings us back to the title of my &#34;review&#34;.

After all, people, including me, make decisions based on what we reviewers say.The premise of this movie is a chilling what if. The Jones family is a living, breathing, slickly packaged selling machine. Imagine the hottest high school classmates, the coolest family in the neighborhood, the most powerful and seemingly wealthiest family in town taking an interest in the normals and trying to impart some of that cool just for the mere asking (and a credit card or two).However, all is not paradise when surrounded by glitter and toys. Each member of the Jones family has a handful of issues. And those issues spill out into the town and cause some serious consequences for them all. It is a gawk-at-the-accident type of fascination to watch the facade crumble and to see the depths some will dive to possess what they think is the key to happiness.Be forewarned. This is not a happy, light film. It's a look into the psychology of want and drive. The R rating is for F-bombs (not excessive) and a female nude scene early in the film when the family dynamics begin to tarnish though the sex scenes are off camera. The ending felt sweeter than the rest of the film predicted and I'm not sure I fully buy it. But it wasn't empty and harsh so those who want ""happy"" endings won't feel the need to throw things at the television.

They can sell a family lifestyle. These individuals who pretended to be a family were people who lived their job. They sold their image. Everything they did was aimed towards selling products. The products would range in scope and it was all about turning the highest profit. The perfect life with all the beauty and comforts and no love. Thats the sad part, so many can find joy in what they own or thru organization, control over their environment. These four unrelated humans talk over how they can achieve their goals by feeding the neighbors and the people they come in contact with all the acourtrements that constitute a good life. I think that they see money in objects , as do the people who get hooked, especially Steve's next door neighbor. The neighbor, played by an actor whose name I do not know, has a wife who is also based in selling products and her life seems to revolve around how she can turn profit instead of being in the moment with her husband and finding the joy in that experience. The movie shows the struggle between the sellers and how their hearts win over their heads. What I liked about the film, I liked the pretty house but the warmth was missing. I liked the food, the cool snacks that she served for dinner, I liked how attractive the girls were, and I liked the spa days. I think that finding the positive is good, wherever you can, the difference is that you don't use it to take the place of love.

1339182,A2DT00ZK4WGOQH,B003EYVXOG,Michael Neiss,"[1, 2]","The Joneses is the kind of high-concept consumer satire that should make my ears perk right up - a clandestine ""stealth marketing"" company (Lifestage Inc.) infiltrates an unnamed Atlanta suburb in the form of a central-casting power family ""The Joneses"" (Demi Moore, David Duchovny + teens) whose sole purpose is to serve as product-placement avatars to the affluent, high achievement inhabitants of their all too planned community.With corporate precision, Lifestage completely choreographs their possessions and lifestyle markers (paid for by eager marketers) right down to the switchplates in their insufferably perfect McMansion - inspiring immediate ego-deflating envy among their unsuspecting, McMoron neighbors. This is Stepford USA minus the zombie-like rictus of Katherine Ross.(The Joneses are in fact one of a thousand family ""cells"" that have been activated and managed in desirable zipcodes throughout the world.)Ultimately, everything in their pre-arranged domicile is for sale as their cars, clothes, technology and ""flash-frozen sushi"" make tongues wag and sales soar as the faux-Jones consumption virus spreads unabated as they move through every country club, high-end spa and high school locker room they can find - racking up commissions as everyone within their orbit starts obsessing over Audis, Taylor Mades and Bacardi rum punch coolers.Unfortunately, nothing in this tepid anti-consumerism screed rises above a made for tv sensibility. The screenplay that showed such promise during the initial fifteen minutes just wilts into morose, melodramatic pabulum. Moore and Duchovny develop an attraction that comes from nowhere and lands in the same place.If you are going to take on a subject as target rich as mindless consumerism, please... just climb over the top with bombastic glee - don't retreat into tired old romantic formulas and bumper sticker humanism at the first sign the subject matter may be getting a bit too heavy. And pretty please, just make the damn thing remotely plausible.My assumption is that as Lifestage employees, the Jones ""family"" are expert salespeople. They must be, given the pace at which they ingratiate themselves into the community, subliminally inspiring purchases of $70,000 automobiles and sat-tv equipped lawn tractors. Marketing jujitsu accomplished at the speed of light, with the alacrity of a master thief - rendering unbelievable nearly all of their MSRP shenanigans.The Joneses surely exist in the marketing Twilight, only punching in at night, especially given the time they spend in the daylight sitting around the house wringing their hands over the cosmic meaning of it all.Although I hate being the spoiler, the pathetic and forced ""happy ending"" where love and integrity inevitably triumpth over venality and greed would even make Frank Capra and Michael Moore snicker in disbelief. In my defense, it's impossible to spoil something that is already curdled.I actually envied one of their neighbors (the always enjoyable Gary Cole) who decided to pull a Kevorkian and wound up six feet under in his swimming pool proudly planted on his new tractor.

Now, a lot of people are giving the film flack for it's ending, but I think that is where the films strength really lays. When the film is showing what consumerism and greed really does to these people (the fake family as well as real ones) is where ""The Joneses"" works best. When writer/director Derrick Borte takes the film into darker territory (a gay bashing sequence, a suicide, a predatory Amber Heard) it gives the film a bit more edge.

In today's fake world --- fake from otherwise unsalable chicken parts pressed into the meat called chicken nuggets to toilet paper manufacturers cutting the size of the toilet roll down more and more while at the same time jacking up the price --- it seems everything is unfortunately subject to much closer scrutiny than in the past.  I was born in 1956 and from 15 on grew up near Rushville, Indiana, so I can still remember when the work ethic was strong and people actually believed and helped one another.  It was a time of you did and meant what you said.  This film brilliantly reflects just how far we have come from that long ago era.David Duchovny and Demi Moore really shine as Steve and Kate Jones, a couple who move into an upscale community, complete with all the coollest gadgets, toys and cars.  They look like such a NICE couple, like the kind you remember from Normal Rockwell paintings, or from the Andy Griffith show in the early 1960s.  Just nice, honorable, pleasant people, the kind you'd want to have as your next door neighbors.  But things are not as they seem.  Without giving away the plot --- which is really refreshingly unusual --- we soon find that we do indeed need to be skeptical of them.  But everyone in their neighborhood is totally taken in, and soon they are all competing with the Joneses to keep up with or even surpass them, with some distastrous and painful results.Gary Cole, a highly underrated actor --- he was fabulous years ago as the convicted killer Jeffrey Macdonald --- brings touching tenderness to a role that could merely have served as a plot device. Glenne Headly as his wife is equally great as a woman desperate to make a career of home sales.  The scene where they are in bed together is painful to watch, as both actors do a really excellent job of showing a couple who have long since passed the point of emotionally looking together in the same direction.But the film is really carried by David Duchovny and Demi Moore.  Their reaction shots to each other and the way they play off each other is quite breathtaking to watch, as opposed to many of today's prettier and younger actors who are barely competent.  Duchovny has come a long way in my opinion since the pilot of The X-Files.  His used car salesman Steve Jones who has fallen into a great money job and yet develops a late-blooming conscience is believable from start to finish.  Demi Moore, a really great actress who in my opinion made some bad career choices the the '90s that held her back for awhile, gives a strong performance as a woman who for the first time is confronting the ethics of what she does for a living and believably goes back and forth about it.  Duchovny's character causes her to think, and the thinking he evokes awakens in her the compassion she never before paid attention to.  That is why the scene in which she comforts Amber Heard, the actress who plays her daughter, is both touching and understandable.Many reviewers in the press seem to think the movie cops out in the ending.  I thought it was all tied up too neatly, but the message of redeem yourself before it's too late I thought was a an excellent one.  It seems to me that this film was a rarity in that it asks you to question who you are, rather than what you do or don't have. In a world of shoot 'em up/crash 'em up/kill 'em up movies that are little more than product placement and/or mindless vapid so-called entertainment, this film makes you THINK.

Well, I would say ""this show is a light drama/dark comedy and there wasn't a laugh in it"".  If I had to compare it to something, I would say it is just a bit like Donnie Darko.  Along the same vein, but a bit lighter in context.I enjoyed this show.  It's not groundbreaking, though it is pretty special for a movie to have a plot that we've never seen before.  The acting is fine...not award winning.  But it was just quite enjoyable and I'd tell you to definitely rent it.  You won't feel your evening was wasted (like with some movies)I enjoyed both Demi and David.....

1339199,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B003EYVXOG,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","Knowing the premise of the film even before seeing it, I expected a sharp satire & disemboweling of American consumerism -- and I got it. What I didn't expect was the compassion I felt for the victims of that mentality, here embodied by Gary Cole & Glenne Headly. The toll exacted by their need to keep up with the Joneses is at first comic & pathetic, but ultimately heartbreaking. And sadly, it's really not over the top at all; countless Americans suffer a similar fate to some degree, being so obsessed with looking ""successful"" that they fail as human beings & ultimately lose themselves in the end.As for the Joneses themselves? David Duchovny is very good as the slick former car salesman who retains a withered root of conscience, one that begins to blossom anew as he sees what's happening to his neighbors (e.g., victims). Demi Moore has the requisite glossy hardness to convince us that to her, nothing is personal, it's all just business. All that ever really matters is being a ""winner"" & getting ahead. And their model-perfect teen ""children"" are marvels at taking advantage of their peers, whose desperation to fit in & be cool makes them very easy prey indeed.I've tried not to give away too much of the plot, so let me just say that while the redemption of one character is quite believable, I'm not so sure about the other one. Perhaps there was studio pressure to have some sort of a happy ending; but in this case, a somewhat bleaker ending would have been more appropriate. Some people choose to put themselves beyond redemption, and I expected more of that by the end.Still, how many contemporary films even begin to delve into the emptiness of American consumerism & materialism, rather than encouraging & glorifying it? For that alone, and for the strength of most of the film, I heartily recommend this film to anyone who questions the shallow values of what passes for our culture today. What's frightening is just how plausible the presented scenario really is ... or could it be happening already? I wouldn't be a bit surprised ...",4,Both scathing & poignant - 4 & 1/2 stars,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,2059,"['Knowing', 'premise', 'film', 'even', 'seeing', 'expected', 'sharp', 'satire', 'disemboweling', 'American', 'consumerism', 'got', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', 'compassion', 'felt', 'victims', 'mentality', 'here', 'embodied', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Glenne', 'Headly', 'toll', 'exacted', 'need', 'keep', 'up', 'Joneses', 'first', 'comic', 'pathetic', 'ultimately', 'heartbreaking', 'sadly', 'really', 'not', 'top', 'countless', 'Americans', 'suffer', 'similar', 'fate', 'degree', 'being', 'so', 'obsessed', 'looking', 'successful', 'fail', 'human', 'beings', 'ultimately', 'lose', 'end.As', 'Joneses', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'very', 'good', 'slick', 'former', 'car', 'salesman', 'who', 'withered', 'root', 'conscience', 'one', 'blossom', 'anew', 'what', 'happening', 'neighbors', 'e.g.', 'victims', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'requisite', 'glossy', 'hardness', 'convince', 'nothing', 'personal', 'just', 'business', 'ever', 'really', 'matters', 'being', 'winner', 'getting', 'ahead', 'model-perfect', 'teen', 'children', 'are', 'marvels', 'taking', 'advantage', 'peers', 'desperation', 'fit', 'be', 'cool', 'very', 'easy', 'prey', 'indeed.I', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'so', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'redemption', 'one', 'character', 'quite', 'believable', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'other', 'one', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'studio', 'pressure', 'have', 'sort', 'happy', 'ending', 'case', 'somewhat', 'bleaker', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate', 'people', 'choose', 'put', 'redemption', 'expected', 'more', 'end.Still', 'how', 'many', 'contemporary', 'films', 'even', 'begin', 'delve', 'emptiness', 'American', 'consumerism', 'materialism', 'rather', 'encouraging', 'glorifying', 'alone', 'strength', 'most', 'film', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'questions', 'shallow', 'values', 'what', 'culture', 'today', 'What', 'frightening', 'just', 'how', 'plausible', 'presented', 'scenario', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'happening', 'already', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bit', 'surprised']",N/A
