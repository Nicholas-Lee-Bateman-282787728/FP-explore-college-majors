724273,A2V2LYKRYYS99D,B0000714F1,D. L. Norwood,"[0, 0]","I have recently purchased 3 DVD's which are:  Mahalia Jackson:  The Power & The Glory, Mahalia Jackson-You'll Never Walk Alone, & The Immortal Mahalia Jackson which shair the same footage as applicable to Disc 2 on this DVD.  Ms. Jackson is on the same dreary stage in the same studio standing sedately under arches or beside a replica of a stained glass window or sitting on a park bench wearing for the most part a choir robe.  All are in black & white.While Disc 2 has many more songs than the previuosly mentioned DVD's, the sound is of the poorest quality in that there is a crackling noise on most of the songs being played (Disc 2).  The songs are for the most part of the same tempo & boring.  Ms. Jackson just stands there looking somber with no joy.Now I absolutely loved Disc 1.  I loved seeing segments of Ms. Jackson in color joyfully performing with a smile on her face, clapping, & obviously enjoying herself as she performed for an adoring audience while singing upbeat songs with a fast tempo.  This could well have been one of the greatest DVD's ever if they would have given complete performances. Disc 1 shows what she was really like as a performer.  I enjoyed the documentary depicting her rise to fame up until she became ill & went into a physical & mental decline.  The end showing her personality change after her heart attacks & the way she acted (deva like) after her final performances was shameful & may well have robbed her of her dignity.  In all fairness, she was severely ill & in pain & had no other solace other than performing.  It left me with a bad taste in my mouth, but it is what it is.  She left us with a wonderful legacy of music which is still being played on the radio & in homes some 38 years after her death.",3,Mahalia Jackson-The Power & The Glory:  The Life & Music of The World's Greatest Singer,1270857600,"04 10, 2010",2010,1757,"['have', 'recently', 'purchased', '3', 'DVD', 'are', 'Mahalia', 'Jackson', 'Power', 'Glory', 'Mahalia', 'Jackson-You', ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Walk', 'Alone', 'Immortal', 'Mahalia', 'Jackson', 'shair', 'same', 'footage', 'applicable', 'Disc', '2', 'DVD', 'Ms.', 'Jackson', 'same', 'dreary', 'stage', 'same', 'studio', 'standing', 'sedately', 'arches', 'beside', 'replica', 'stained', 'glass', 'window', 'sitting', 'park', 'bench', 'wearing', 'most', 'part', 'choir', 'robe', 'are', 'black', 'white.While', 'Disc', '2', 'many', 'more', 'songs', 'previuosly', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'sound', 'poorest', 'quality', 'crackling', 'noise', 'most', 'songs', 'being', 'played', 'Disc', '2', 'songs', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'same', 'tempo', 'boring', 'Ms.', 'Jackson', 'just', 'looking', 'somber', 'joy.Now', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Disc', '1', 'loved', 'seeing', 'segments', 'Ms.', 'Jackson', 'color', 'joyfully', 'performing', 'smile', 'face', 'clapping', 'obviously', 'enjoying', 'performed', 'adoring', 'audience', 'singing', 'upbeat', 'songs', 'fast', 'tempo', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'greatest', 'DVD', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'complete', 'performances', 'Disc', '1', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'performer', 'enjoyed', 'documentary', 'depicting', 'rise', 'fame', 'up', 'became', 'ill', 'went', 'physical', 'mental', 'decline', 'end', 'showing', 'personality', 'change', 'heart', 'way', 'acted', 'final', 'performances', 'was', 'shameful', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'robbed', 'dignity', 'fairness', 'was', 'severely', 'ill', 'pain', 'had', 'other', 'solace', 'other', 'performing', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'what', 'left', 'wonderful', 'legacy', 'music', 'still', 'being', 'played', 'radio', 'homes', '38', 'years', 'death']",Mahalia Jackson - The Power and the Glory: The Life and Music of the World's Greatest Gospel Singer

724279,AYU9LBROYQBG6,B0000714F1,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[7, 7]","I grew up listening to and admiring the voice of Mahalia Jackson. I began to collect her precious recordings, When I first saw this documentary, I declared, ""I must have this in my collection"". This set is priceless because accompanied with the cd of a great documentary of a legendary Gospel Singer that painstakingly narrates her life, there are 39 rare vintage performances of Mahalia at her ""Zenith"" Listening to her actually perform truly memorable songs such as ""when the saints come marching in"" ""Guide me oh Great Jehova!"" and other truly memorable songs bring you to tears. The Great Mahalia has a voice that will lift you to great heights and when you finish listening to her, you feel as if you were on a mountain and witnessed a breathtaking view and you do not want to ever leave that mountaintop! Mahalia is very engaging as you see her sincere  Facial expressions and her ability to thrust her whole being in her song. One is left with the impression that she lived those songs, for they were sung with her heart. This set is a must for all Gospel and Jazz enthusiasts in the world. Teens and adults, get this so that you can recognize why there will never be another Mahalia Jackson!All the Best!Noel SerranoMahalia Jackson Group-2009Hi5 Networks[...]",5,Experience the True Power and Sheer Glory of the Queen!,1045094400,"02 13, 2003",2003,1267,"['grew', 'up', 'listening', 'admiring', 'voice', 'Mahalia', 'Jackson', 'began', 'collect', 'precious', 'recordings', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'documentary', 'declared', 'must', 'have', 'collection', 'set', 'priceless', 'accompanied', 'cd', 'great', 'documentary', 'legendary', 'Gospel', 'Singer', 'painstakingly', 'life', 'are', '39', 'rare', 'vintage', 'performances', 'Mahalia', 'Zenith', 'Listening', 'actually', 'perform', 'truly', 'memorable', 'songs', 'such', 'when', 'saints', 'come', 'marching', 'Guide', 'Great', 'Jehova', 'other', 'truly', 'memorable', 'songs', 'bring', 'tears', 'Great', 'Mahalia', 'voice', 'will', 'lift', 'great', 'heights', 'when', 'finish', 'listening', 'feel', 'were', 'mountain', 'witnessed', 'breathtaking', 'view', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'ever', 'leave', 'mountaintop', 'Mahalia', 'very', 'engaging', 'see', 'sincere', 'Facial', 'expressions', 'ability', 'thrust', 'whole', 'being', 'song', 'One', 'left', 'impression', 'lived', 'songs', 'were', 'sung', 'heart', 'set', 'must', 'Gospel', 'Jazz', 'enthusiasts', 'world', 'Teens', 'adults', 'get', 'so', 'can', 'recognize', 'why', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Mahalia', 'Jackson', 'Best', 'Noel', 'SerranoMahalia', 'Jackson', 'Group-2009Hi5', 'Networks', '[', ']']",Mahalia Jackson - The Power and the Glory: The Life and Music of the World's Greatest Gospel Singer
