The story was exciting and for the most part close to believeable without too much effort put into suspension of disbelief. I mean, sure, there are a few two many coincidences occurring when a kid whose father has been framed and imprisoned winds up unintentionally stumbing on evidence which leads to his father's release and vindication, but the fun tone of the movie makes this easy to accept. The soundtrack and production were very strong. Some of the actors seemed a little inexperienced at times (and strangely enough, I'm talking about the adults in the movie and not the kids!), but overall they pulled it off and made a very fun movie.",5,Lots of fun!,1143158400,"03 24, 2006",2006,761,"['movie', 'lot', 'more', 'attention', 'received', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'genre', 'story', 'was', 'exciting', 'most', 'part', 'close', 'believeable', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'put', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'mean', 'sure', 'are', 'few', 'two', 'many', 'coincidences', 'occurring', 'when', 'kid', 'father', 'been', 'framed', 'imprisoned', 'up', 'unintentionally', 'stumbing', 'evidence', 'father', 'release', 'vindication', 'fun', 'tone', 'movie', 'easy', 'accept', 'soundtrack', 'production', 'were', 'very', 'strong', 'actors', 'seemed', 'little', 'inexperienced', 'times', 'strangely', 'enough', ""'m"", 'talking', 'adults', 'movie', 'not', 'kids', 'overall', 'pulled', 'off', 'made', 'very', 'fun', 'movie']",N/A

Actually, I am quite pleased. Message was a fun little thrill ride that held my interest throughout, and offered up a nice bit of suspense to boot.The story is interesting. Boy finds cell phone, tries to return it to it's owner only to hear from outside his door a message being left on a cell phone about a drop and when its to take place and then a short conversation between this man and someone else in the room, then silenced gunshots. Now everyone from DEA agents to bumbling hitmen are out to get this cell phone before the drop takes place, and it's never clear who's who until the end, so the whole time you're rooting for the boy and his 2 friends to overcome all the obstacles in his way. It helps too that theres a correlation of this whole incident with the framing of the boy's ex DEA agent dad, which landed him in jail.Best scene: when the bad guys find out the boy's name and get to his house. Great suspense and naturally ingenious scene for the young boy.All in all Message in a Cell Phone is a good example of a kids thriller done right, and wouldn't it be nice if there were more of this type of movie. 3.5 stars",3,Message: fun,1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,1263,"['movie', 'came', 'recommendation', 'Amazon', 'rare', 'take', 'suggestions', 'decided', ""'d"", 'try', 'one', 'Actually', 'am', 'quite', 'pleased', 'Message', 'was', 'fun', 'little', 'thrill', 'ride', 'held', 'interest', 'offered', 'up', 'nice', 'bit', 'suspense', 'boot.The', 'story', 'interesting', 'Boy', 'cell', 'phone', 'return', 'owner', 'only', 'hear', 'door', 'message', 'being', 'left', 'cell', 'phone', 'drop', 'when', 'take', 'place', 'then', 'short', 'conversation', 'man', 'someone', 'else', 'room', 'then', 'silenced', 'gunshots', 'Now', 'everyone', 'DEA', 'agents', 'bumbling', 'hitmen', 'are', 'out', 'get', 'cell', 'phone', 'drop', 'place', 'never', 'clear', 'who', 'who', 'end', 'whole', 'time', ""'re"", 'rooting', 'boy', '2', 'friends', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'way', 'too', 'correlation', 'whole', 'incident', 'framing', 'boy', 'ex', 'DEA', 'agent', 'dad', 'landed', 'jail.Best', 'scene', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'find', 'out', 'boy', 'name', 'get', 'house', 'Great', 'suspense', 'naturally', 'ingenious', 'scene', 'young', 'boy.All', 'Message', 'Cell', 'Phone', 'good', 'example', 'kids', 'thriller', 'done', 'right', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'were', 'more', 'type', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

Then the boss of the drug dealers, tired of waiting forresults from his underlings, intervenes and finally on the cellphone offers Chase a huge sum of money in an attempt to get thephone back.  It is during this conversation that he finds out theboy's name when his irritated mother shouts out his name (infull) to get him to the table to eat his meal.  This now putsChase in serious danger and it becomes a game no longer.The movie becomes more tense and menacing when Chase is left athome alone one night and a masked man breaks into the home totake the phone and he threatens Chase.  This results in adesperate scramble around the house with Chase eventuallymanaging to avoid his attacker.Whilst fleeing along the deserted street, a friend of the familywho was driving by, picks up the panic stricken Chase and tellshim that he will drive him to the Police Station where he canreport the matter.  On the way there, they have to stop at thelocal entertainment centre where Chase's life is againthreatened.The climax to the movie comes when Chase is finally trapped onthe upper level of the entertainment centre and all alone hemust face his attacker.Thrilling and nail-biting stuff isn't it ?You will surely want to know:*  Who Chase's hooded attacker is (unexpected surprise).*  What happens when Chase is trapped in the entertainment centre.Sorry, but I should not reveal all here.Buy the disc and find out for yourself.You won't be disappointed.",4,Message in a Cell Phone,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,2992,"['Message', 'Cell', 'Phone', 'was', 'made', '2000', 'intelligentand', 'absorbing', 'little', 'movie', 'three', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'accidentrather', 'intent', 'are', 'drawn', 'adult', 'world', 'deceit', 'andcorruption', 'result', 'fascinating', 'entertainment.Chase', 'Patterson', 'Nick', 'Whitaker', 'two', 'friends', 'are', 'swimmingand', 'having', 'fun', 'resort', 'pool', 'when', 'unattended', 'cell', 'phonerings', 'curious', 'Chase', 'phone', ""phone'sowner"", 'who', 'inadvertantly', 'left', 'phone', 'pool', 'when', 'hereturned', 'unit', 'being', 'hurry', 'catch', 'plane', 'Chase', 'take', 'phone', 'up', 'unit', 'hewill', 'give', '5', 'So', 'series', 'perplexing', 'events.When', 'Chase', 'door', 'unit', 'anarguement', 'scuffle', 'followed', 'gunshot', 'Suspecting', 'foulplay', 'resort', 'manager', 'when', 'enter', 'unitthey', 'find', 'nobody', 'nothing', 'been', 'disturbed.Apparently', 'man', 'who', 'left', 'cell', 'phone', 'pool', 'was', 'aFederal', 'Narcotics', 'Agent', 'who', 'disposed', 'wereillegal', 'drug', 'dealers.Chase', 'sure', 'been', 'foul', 'play', 'can', 'not', 'prove', 'it.Chase', 'still', 'cell', 'phone', 'possession', 'soon', 'afterhe', 'receives', 'various', 'people', 'trying', 'find', 'outwho', 'phone', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'then', 'realizeshow', 'important', 'cell', 'phone', 'must', 'holdincriminating', 'information', 'stored', 'voice', 'mail', 'system.Big', 'problem', 'not', 'know', 'code', 'access', 'data.Chase', 'friends', 'spend', 'considerable', 'time', 'trying', 'break', 'thecode', 'Then', 'boss', 'drug', 'dealers', 'tired', 'waiting', 'forresults', 'underlings', 'intervenes', 'finally', 'cellphone', 'Chase', 'huge', 'sum', 'money', 'attempt', 'get', 'thephone', 'back', 'conversation', 'out', 'theboy', 'name', 'when', 'irritated', 'mother', 'out', 'name', 'infull', 'get', 'table', 'eat', 'meal', 'now', 'serious', 'danger', 'game', 'longer.The', 'movie', 'more', 'tense', 'menacing', 'when', 'Chase', 'left', 'athome', 'alone', 'one', 'night', 'masked', 'man', 'home', 'totake', 'phone', 'Chase', 'results', 'adesperate', 'scramble', 'house', 'Chase', 'eventuallymanaging', 'avoid', 'attacker.Whilst', 'fleeing', 'deserted', 'street', 'friend', 'familywho', 'was', 'driving', 'up', 'panic', 'stricken', 'Chase', 'tellshim', 'will', 'drive', 'Police', 'Station', 'where', 'canreport', 'matter', 'way', 'there', 'have', 'stop', 'thelocal', 'entertainment', 'centre', 'where', 'Chase', 'life', 'againthreatened.The', 'climax', 'movie', 'when', 'Chase', 'finally', 'trapped', 'onthe', 'upper', 'level', 'entertainment', 'centre', 'alone', 'hemust', 'face', 'attacker.Thrilling', 'nail-biting', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'will', 'surely', 'want', 'know', '*', 'Who', 'Chase', 'hooded', 'attacker', 'unexpected', 'surprise', '*', 'What', 'when', 'Chase', 'trapped', 'entertainment', 'centre.Sorry', 'should', 'not', 'reveal', 'disc', 'find', 'out', 'yourself.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
