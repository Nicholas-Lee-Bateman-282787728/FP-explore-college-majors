1366643,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B003V3FTYU,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","I find it odd that Growing the BIG One is billed as a romantic comedy.  It fell short on both counts.  In fact, the plot was lifted straight from plot central where all the lazy writers get their ideas.  You can even check off the points used to make this lackluster film as you watch it unfold.  It started with death, debt, a pushy neighbor, job woes, and a dopey plan to solve all the aforementioned problems by winning big bucks......growing a BIG pumpkin.  The main character Emma (Shannen Doherty) could just as easily gone the lotto route and gambled her future away on luck, that's how practical this scheme was.  Calling the plot artificial from the get-go is putting it kindly.  I could have accepted all the snowballing-worse-case-scenarios though, if it was at least funny or romantic.  But for some strange reason only the filmmakers know, they held back on everything.  The two leads, while attractive enough, didn't have any chemistry because it wasn't written into the story.  Their relationship was amiable at best; they were like best buds out to build a clubhouse.  They never got mad enough or sad enough, there was no sexual tension!  The writers even halfheartedly wrote in the possibility of a triangle between the mechanic, the radio host, and a manure guy, but it went nowhere.  The two villains in this piece, the shallow new bossy boss and the mayor of the Podunk town, couldn't even sustain more than an ""oh-no"" moment each.  This movie definitely lacked enthusiasm in all departments.  It's beyond generic; it's lifeless.  It's also harmless, tame, and uncomplicated and ends with the obvious.When the credits began to roll, I had to ask myself did they even kiss?

1366645,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B003V3FTYU,J. Olsen,"[24, 28]","Shannen Doherty plays Emma, a radio host at a Seattle based station. After receiving word that her grandfather has died, she drives the 3+ hours to get to the little community of Valleyville (pop. 800) where he had lived. She finds her grandpa's lawyer, a young man who has his office in the back of a store and whose main livelihood appears to be selling his own special blend of fertilizer (aka decomposed manure). He tells her that her grandfather and the community have already made all of the funeral arrangements.But there is one thing her grandfather didn't take care of. He was deeply in debt and if the debt is not paid by the end of the year his farm would be repossessed and sold to developers. Her grandfather had trusted her not to let that happen. Now she needs to come up with $75,000 to prevent his farm from becoming part of the mayor's development plan.In the meantime, things have been shaken up at the radio station with which she is employed and she has been reassigned to do a gardening show (about which she knows nothing), broadcast live from the farm she just inherited. Webcams are placed in the farmhouse and around the garden so listeners can even watch her broadcast, and her daily life.Her neighbor is a scruffy looking mechanic who appears to repair everybody's vehicles, lawnmowers, appliances, etc., and half of his work seems scattered across his yard. His work is threatened by the coming of ""Mighty Muffler,"" also part of the mayor's plan. He is trying to raise enough money to put his own shop on main street to keep up with the coming competition. (Though their relationship is fraught with mishaps, there is more to this guy than meets the eye, as she later learns.)This is where the pumpkins come into the picture. This small town is known for its pumpkin festival and the locals have a fierce competition every year for the honor of growing the ""Big One."" Emma's grandpa had been one of the contenders, even winning the past couple of years. The competitors save their seeds and guard them closely to use the next year. Emma's grandpa had left her his precious seeds. Her neighbor wants to buy them from her to grow the winning pumpkin to get the money for his shop. But she won't sell. She sees this as the opportunity to raise the money to save the farm by raising the biggest pumpkin and winning the $25,000 prize money--which will be doubled if your pumpkin breaks the world record.*SPOILER ALERT*The local wives of the other major contenders befriend Emma and among other things they tell her that her grandfather kept a journal about growing his pumpkins and she will find all the info she needs if she can find that journal. When she finally discovers the book it seems to be written in a sort of poetic code, which she deciphers the best she can. Her pumpkin growing becomes the focus of her radio program. When the radio show becomes a hit with the target audience she is given a chance for a tv promotional spot. The producers think she is a natural in front of the camera and offer her a tv show, which would mean money to pay off the farm--and moving to New York. Now she has to consider the life she has developed in Valleyville and if she is prepared to leave it all behind--her pumpkin, her friends and her neighbor.My husband and I watched this together and we had also recently watched a program on PBS that covered a real-life pumpkin festival in a small town and the lengths to which the participants go to grow the winner. There were some things in this movie that rang true, but we both agreed that there was a great deal of artistic license taken in the portrayal of the process.My favorite people in this movie were the wives of the other pumpkin growers. They seemed the most real. And there is a surprise element involving the pumpkin journal that was cute. If you love either or both of the leads you will probably like this movie just because of them. I was not overly impressed with the acting and some things in the storyline didn't click--like the passage of time and seasons. That was quite unclear, and when your plot is based upon growing something it does seem like an essential element to the story. As far as offensive content goes, there are a few swear words and some profanity, along with one incident of potty humor. There is no suggestive sexual content or violence. I didn't find myself getting extremely caught up in the story, though there were several entertaining moments. It was light escape watching. You may enjoy it, but you might want to find it for rent or on TV first and see if it meets your expectations before spending money on it.",3,The Great Pumpkin?,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,4628,"['Shannen', 'Doherty', 'Emma', 'radio', 'host', 'Seattle', 'based', 'station', 'receiving', 'word', 'grandfather', 'died', '3+', 'hours', 'get', 'little', 'community', 'Valleyville', 'pop', '800', 'where', 'had', 'lived', 'grandpa', 'lawyer', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'office', 'back', 'store', 'main', 'livelihood', 'be', 'selling', 'own', 'special', 'blend', 'fertilizer', 'aka', 'decomposed', 'manure', 'grandfather', 'community', 'have', 'already', 'made', 'funeral', 'arrangements.But', 'one', 'thing', 'grandfather', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'care', 'was', 'deeply', 'debt', 'debt', 'not', 'paid', 'end', 'year', 'farm', 'would', 'be', 'repossessed', 'sold', 'developers', 'grandfather', 'had', 'trusted', 'not', 'let', 'happen', 'Now', 'come', 'up', '75,000', 'prevent', 'farm', 'becoming', 'part', 'mayor', 'development', 'meantime', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'shaken', 'up', 'radio', 'station', 'employed', 'been', 'reassigned', 'do', 'gardening', 'show', 'nothing', 'broadcast', 'live', 'farm', 'just', 'inherited', 'Webcams', 'are', 'placed', 'farmhouse', 'garden', 'listeners', 'can', 'even', 'watch', 'broadcast', 'daily', 'life.Her', 'neighbor', 'scruffy', 'looking', 'mechanic', 'who', 'repair', 'everybody', 'vehicles', 'lawnmowers', 'appliances', 'etc.', 'half', 'work', 'scattered', 'yard', 'work', 'threatened', 'coming', 'Mighty', 'Muffler', 'also', 'part', 'mayor', 'plan', 'trying', 'raise', 'enough', 'money', 'put', 'own', 'shop', 'main', 'street', 'keep', 'up', 'coming', 'competition', 'relationship', 'fraught', 'mishaps', 'more', 'guy', 'eye', 'later', 'where', 'pumpkins', 'come', 'picture', 'small', 'town', 'known', 'pumpkin', 'festival', 'locals', 'have', 'fierce', 'competition', 'year', 'honor', 'growing', 'Big', 'One', 'Emma', 'grandpa', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'contenders', 'even', 'winning', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'competitors', 'save', 'seeds', 'guard', 'closely', 'use', 'next', 'year', 'Emma', 'grandpa', 'had', 'left', 'precious', 'seeds', 'neighbor', 'buy', 'grow', 'winning', 'pumpkin', 'get', 'money', 'shop', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sell', 'opportunity', 'raise', 'money', 'save', 'farm', 'raising', 'biggest', 'pumpkin', 'winning', '25,000', 'prize', 'money', 'will', 'be', 'doubled', 'pumpkin', 'world', 'record', '*SPOILER', 'ALERT*The', 'local', 'wives', 'other', 'major', 'contenders', 'befriend', 'Emma', 'other', 'things', 'tell', 'grandfather', 'kept', 'journal', 'growing', 'pumpkins', 'will', 'find', 'info', 'can', 'find', 'journal', 'When', 'finally', 'book', 'be', 'written', 'sort', 'poetic', 'code', 'best', 'can', 'pumpkin', 'growing', 'focus', 'radio', 'program', 'When', 'radio', 'show', 'hit', 'target', 'audience', 'given', 'chance', 'tv', 'promotional', 'spot', 'producers', 'think', 'natural', 'front', 'camera', 'offer', 'tv', 'show', 'would', 'mean', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'farm', 'moving', 'New', 'York', 'Now', 'consider', 'life', 'developed', 'Valleyville', 'prepared', 'leave', 'behind', 'pumpkin', 'friends', 'neighbor.My', 'husband', 'watched', 'together', 'had', 'also', 'recently', 'watched', 'program', 'PBS', 'covered', 'real-life', 'pumpkin', 'festival', 'small', 'town', 'lengths', 'participants', 'go', 'grow', 'winner', 'were', 'things', 'movie', 'true', 'agreed', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'artistic', 'license', 'taken', 'portrayal', 'process.My', 'favorite', 'people', 'movie', 'were', 'wives', 'other', 'pumpkin', 'growers', 'seemed', 'most', 'real', 'surprise', 'element', 'involving', 'pumpkin', 'journal', 'was', 'cute', 'love', 'leads', 'will', 'probably', 'movie', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'impressed', 'acting', 'things', 'storyline', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'passage', 'time', 'seasons', 'was', 'quite', 'unclear', 'when', 'plot', 'based', 'growing', 'something', 'seem', 'essential', 'element', 'story', 'As', 'far', 'offensive', 'content', 'are', 'few', 'swear', 'words', 'profanity', 'one', 'incident', 'potty', 'humor', 'suggestive', 'sexual', 'content', 'violence', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'getting', 'extremely', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'were', 'several', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'was', 'light', 'escape', 'watching', 'may', 'enjoy', 'might', 'want', 'find', 'rent', 'TV', 'first', 'see', 'expectations', 'spending', 'money']",N/A
