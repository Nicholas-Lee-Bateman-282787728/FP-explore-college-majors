1250857,A13REJCAOK9OST,B002624SIK,"G. Johnson ""snow""","[4, 7]","I don't remember why I got this movie.  It is really an almost.  I think I had the impression that the actors were very good, but the script and the unity of the story was just not the cream of the crop.  However (not being an expert on these things) the costumes and sets were fabulous, really well done.  For me I live somewhere where there are no spanish speakers, or media, and so it was nice to hear the Spanish language spoken and tell myself I'm not losing it.  I imagine that is not a great concern for most perusers, tho.  This might be only a 2 star.",3,so-so,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,560,"['do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'why', 'got', 'movie', 'really', 'almost', 'think', 'had', 'impression', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'script', 'unity', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'cream', 'crop', 'However', 'not', 'being', 'expert', 'things', 'costumes', 'sets', 'were', 'fabulous', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'live', 'somewhere', 'where', 'are', 'spanish', 'speakers', 'media', 'was', 'nice', 'hear', 'Spanish', 'language', 'spoken', 'tell', ""'m"", 'not', 'losing', 'imagine', 'not', 'great', 'concern', 'most', 'perusers', 'tho', 'might', 'be', 'only', '2', 'star']",Los Borgia
1250858,A6R8XXQNF10NY,B002624SIK,J. Prather,"[95, 96]","First, a few clarifications. Although the ""Product Details"" section says the film is 120 minutes in length and is presented in a ""full screen"" version, it actually runs over two hours and twenty minutes and is in a wide-screen format(it looks to be about 2.35:1 to me). Yellow, English subtitles are also available.Now for the movie itself. I'm not an expert, but the film seems to be fairly accurate historically, especially for ""movie history"". This is most apparent in the depiction of Lucretia Borgia, played by Maria Valverde. She is not the murderous poisoner of legend, but a pawn of her father and brothers who is married off so the Borgias can create political alliances with other powerful families. There are some liberties taken with historical facts in order to tighten the narrative and make events less confusing. For example, in reality, Lucretia was only thirteen years old at the time of her first marriage. However, there's plenty of corruption, intrigue and assassination to keep the film interesting. Late in the film, when it looks like it might be slowing down a bit, Paz Vega shows up as sword-wielding Borgia opponent Caterina Sforza and gives the film a shot of adrenalin.The movie is beautiful looking with lucious sets, costumes, and photography. It's fortunate that the film is presented in widescreen so this can be fully appreciated. The acting is also fine. The film has many virtues, but for me, comes up just short of those other Renaissance films QUEEN MARGOT and the first ELIZABETH with Cate Blanchett. That said, it's still a fine, entertaining film and well worth watching.",4,LOS BORGIA,1260230400,"12 8, 2009",2009,1612,"['First', 'few', 'clarifications', 'Product', 'Details', 'section', 'film', '120', 'minutes', 'length', 'presented', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'actually', 'two', 'hours', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'wide-screen', 'format', 'be', 'about', '2.35:1', 'Yellow', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'also', 'available.Now', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'film', 'be', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'historically', 'especially', 'movie', 'history', 'most', 'apparent', 'depiction', 'Lucretia', 'Borgia', 'played', 'Maria', 'Valverde', 'not', 'murderous', 'poisoner', 'legend', 'pawn', 'father', 'brothers', 'who', 'married', 'Borgias', 'can', 'create', 'political', 'alliances', 'other', 'powerful', 'families', 'are', 'liberties', 'taken', 'historical', 'facts', 'order', 'tighten', 'narrative', 'make', 'events', 'less', 'confusing', 'example', 'reality', 'Lucretia', 'was', 'only', 'thirteen', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'first', 'marriage', 'However', 'plenty', 'corruption', 'intrigue', 'assassination', 'keep', 'film', 'interesting', 'Late', 'film', 'when', 'might', 'be', 'slowing', 'down', 'bit', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'up', 'sword-wielding', 'Borgia', 'opponent', 'Caterina', 'Sforza', 'film', 'shot', 'adrenalin.The', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'lucious', 'sets', 'costumes', 'photography', 'fortunate', 'film', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'can', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'acting', 'also', 'fine', 'film', 'many', 'virtues', 'up', 'just', 'short', 'other', 'Renaissance', 'films', 'QUEEN', 'MARGOT', 'first', 'ELIZABETH', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'said', 'still', 'fine', 'entertaining', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Los Borgia

The cinematography is excellent, the music enhances the emotions without being overly dramatic, and the costumes and architecture aappear to be accurate.  The acting is superb and convincing.  Paz Vega is outstanding in a very small part.The events are depicted realistically, with more violence than many would care for; this film is not for the squeamish nor is it appropriate for children.I liked this film immensely, but I cannot place it on my list of 100 greatest films I've even seen.

In many respects I found this film superior.The success of a film is dependent upon a multiplicity of factors.  Some of those are intangibles.  Why we like one performer's work and not another's.  Such an intangible struck me at the very onset of the film.  The actors from the start of the film were 'darker' and more 'angular'.  Certainly in keeping with my own preconceptions of a proper 'Borgia-esc' look.Much of the film was exceptionally well done.  However, some literary license was taken with historical fact.  While it makes for a better telling story, purists may bristle.  There is also some violence and nudity which some might be troubled with.  This IS a foreign language film (Spanish) and for those like me the subtitles are essential.  This film flashes those subtitles perhaps more quickly than any other film I have encountered recently.  While they are by no means beyond comprehension, they do require a bit of effort to keep up with and can deter somewhat from one's appreciation of the action on the screen.It is said that Mario Puzo drew upon the Borgias as inspiration for the Godfather.  'Los Borgias' is certainly an excellent 'Godfather' where Sonny lived and there was no Michael to assume his father's mantle.",5,The Best of the Borgias,1318636800,"10 15, 2011",2011,1405,"['advent', 'Showtime', 'Borgia', 'series', 'film', 'documentary', 'pertaining', 'Borgias', 'can', 'not', 'pass', 'comparison', 'Showtime', 'offering', 'many', 'respects', 'found', 'film', 'superior.The', 'success', 'film', 'dependent', 'multiplicity', 'factors', 'are', 'intangibles', 'Why', 'like', 'one', 'performer', 'work', 'not', 'intangible', 'struck', 'very', 'onset', 'film', 'actors', 'start', 'film', 'were', ""'darker"", 'more', ""'angular"", 'Certainly', 'keeping', 'own', 'preconceptions', 'proper', ""'Borgia-esc"", 'look.Much', 'film', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'However', 'literary', 'license', 'was', 'taken', 'historical', 'fact', 'better', 'telling', 'story', 'purists', 'may', 'bristle', 'also', 'violence', 'nudity', 'might', 'be', 'troubled', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'are', 'essential', 'film', 'flashes', 'subtitles', 'perhaps', 'more', 'quickly', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'encountered', 'recently', 'are', 'means', 'comprehension', 'do', 'require', 'bit', 'effort', 'keep', 'up', 'can', 'deter', 'somewhat', 'one', 'appreciation', 'action', 'screen.It', 'said', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'drew', 'Borgias', 'inspiration', 'Godfather', 'Borgias', 'certainly', 'excellent', ""'Godfather"", 'where', 'Sonny', 'lived', 'was', 'Michael', 'assume', 'father', 'mantle']",Los Borgia
