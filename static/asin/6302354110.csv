308541,A5FS50VW0GWEE,6302354110,"Baseball ""Johnny""","[4, 6]","I watched this about 16 years ago when I was 20 and I think this movie is outstanding. It's about a pharoah named Kufu wanting a slave named Vashta to build a pyramid for him. Vashta does this because the pharaoh says he will let Vashta's people go if he builds this pyramid for him. Vashta agrees, but he still knows he has to die in the end but it's a risk he is willing to take just to save his people. It passes about 15 years and you now see Vashta's son Senta a grown man. Vashta is having a hard time reading in this pyramid because of old age and Senta decides he has to help his father and his people. Vashta is reluctant to let his son taking the chance of dying because Vashta has to tell him the secret about where the pharaoh is being burried when he passes. When Kufu makes a suprise visit to the pyramid the domino-effect stone accidentally brakes loose from the rope and falls down which triggers a pole or something to fall on Kufu. Senta helps him back up and brings him out of the pyramid knowing that Kufu knows Senta knows the secret so now Senta will have to also.Kufu is married to a lady named Nyla and they enjoy their life together and even have a son named Zainan. Kufu gets attracted to a lady from Syria named Nelefa so he marries her and she becomes his second wife. Nelefa is a true witch and wants all the jewlery that Kufu owns to herself. She tries to kill Nyla knowing maybe she could get more power being actual queen. She gets Zainan a flute and Nelefa and Zufu's security guard (trader!) plan to release a snake which is attracted to the flute. So when Zainan is playing the flute at night and they release the snake Nyla risks her own life by killing the snake and killing herself as well just to save her son. Kufu knows their is something suspecious so he goes to his mistresses room. He finds her with her security guard after hours but Nelefa finds a blood trail (one of Nelefa's slaves tried to kill Kufu but Kufu killed him but he was stabbed in the process). Nelefa disguises to act like it was just the security guards fault and the two are in a battle. Kufu wins and kills the guard but by not seriously injuring himself as well. The pharaoh dies because of this fatal stabbing. Now Nelefa knows that she can be queen. In the mean while Kufu's right-hand-man Hamar tells Vashta and Senta that they don't have to die and their people will be released out of goodness of building this pyramid. When Nelefa goes into the burial chamber of the tomb thinking that she is getting all the jewlery there is a sudden suprise.

308548,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6302354110,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 5]","Jack Hawkins rules the world as the great Pharaoh, Cheops.  Returning home at the outset of the film from a monumentally victorious military campaign, he settles in to his next big project - a pyramid in which he and his riches will be sealed from the outside world once he's finished in this one.  This pharaoh, we quickly learn, has spent too much to acquire his riches to just give them to another generation.  Immediately dissatisfied with his own architects, he turns to the most brilliant of the slaves taken on his last campaign to design a truly impregnable and monumental crypt.  The story parallels the life of Pharaoh and the building of the pyramid.  We see slaves taking to the labor with effort, though time and the lash soon erode that.  As the pyramid grows, smaller stones are required, but they have to go up higher, and Egypt's quarries are approaching exhaustion.  Worse, the country is running out of food to pay for its slaves.  Instead, Egypt begins extorting riches from other countries - a strategy that backfires when Cyprus sends the sultry Nellifer (Joan Collins) as a tribute.  Nellifer steals the heart of the already married Pharaoh and, becoming his second wife, schemes after his throne.  In the end, which I won't give away, we find the evil Nellifer undone by greed as the Pharaoh had been.  It's not a terribly ironic end, but the film plays it well.So why not five stars?  The talent was there -Hawks and Hawkins on opposite sides of the camera, Faulkner on the script, and even a very young Joan Collins as Nellifer - but something's missing.  Despite the epic scope, the story never rises above that of a greedy king and his money.  There are no massive battle scenes (and with the victorious return at the movie's beginning, it's hard to avoid the idea that we've already missed the best part of the movie), and the plot (which covers years) never shows its arc.  We know at the outset that Hawkins' king will be undone by his greed (the sage Vashtar tells this to the king's face) and the wise Hamar seems to have no role except to curb Pharaoh's avarice.  The dialog, despite legend, actually rises above hokum (Faulkner reportedly had to apologize for his script, claiming he had no idea how a Pharaoh talked; Yul Brenner never had to use that excuse) though the lack of plot only highlights plot holes and gaps that a more dynamic story would have hidden.  While ""Land"" isn't the cheese-fest that fans have claimed it to be, it's not as serious a story as ""The Egyptian"".",3,Deserves a 2nd look,1049155200,"04 1, 2003",2003,2515,"['Jack', 'Hawkins', 'rules', 'world', 'great', 'Pharaoh', 'Cheops', 'Returning', 'home', 'outset', 'film', 'monumentally', 'victorious', 'military', 'campaign', 'next', 'big', 'project', 'pyramid', 'riches', 'will', 'be', 'sealed', 'outside', 'world', 'finished', 'one', 'pharaoh', 'quickly', 'learn', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'acquire', 'riches', 'just', 'give', 'generation', 'Immediately', 'dissatisfied', 'own', 'architects', 'most', 'brilliant', 'slaves', 'taken', 'last', 'campaign', 'design', 'truly', 'impregnable', 'monumental', 'crypt', 'story', 'life', 'Pharaoh', 'building', 'pyramid', 'see', 'slaves', 'taking', 'labor', 'effort', 'time', 'lash', 'soon', 'erode', 'pyramid', 'grows', 'smaller', 'stones', 'are', 'required', 'have', 'go', 'up', 'higher', 'Egypt', 'quarries', 'are', 'approaching', 'exhaustion', 'Worse', 'country', 'running', 'out', 'food', 'pay', 'slaves', 'Instead', 'Egypt', 'extorting', 'riches', 'other', 'countries', 'strategy', 'when', 'Cyprus', 'sultry', 'Nellifer', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'tribute', 'heart', 'already', 'married', 'Pharaoh', 'becoming', 'second', 'wife', 'schemes', 'throne', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'find', 'evil', 'Nellifer', 'undone', 'greed', 'Pharaoh', 'had', 'been', 'not', 'terribly', 'ironic', 'end', 'film', 'well.So', 'why', 'not', 'five', 'stars', 'talent', 'was', 'there', '-Hawks', 'opposite', 'sides', 'camera', 'Faulkner', 'script', 'even', 'very', 'young', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'Nellifer', 'something', 'missing', 'epic', 'scope', 'story', 'never', 'greedy', 'king', 'money', 'are', 'massive', 'battle', 'scenes', 'victorious', 'return', 'movie', 'beginning', 'hard', 'avoid', 'idea', ""'ve"", 'already', 'missed', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'plot', 'years', 'never', 'arc', 'know', 'outset', 'Hawkins', 'king', 'will', 'be', 'undone', 'greed', 'sage', 'Vashtar', 'king', 'face', 'wise', 'Hamar', 'have', 'role', 'curb', 'Pharaoh', 'avarice', 'dialog', 'legend', 'actually', 'hokum', 'Faulkner', 'reportedly', 'had', 'apologize', 'script', 'claiming', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'Pharaoh', 'talked', 'Yul', 'Brenner', 'never', 'had', 'use', 'excuse', 'lack', 'plot', 'only', 'plot', 'holes', 'gaps', 'more', 'dynamic', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'hidden', 'Land', ""n't"", 'cheese-fest', 'fans', 'have', 'claimed', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'serious', 'story', 'Egyptian']",N/A

308551,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302354110,Simon Davis,"[62, 64]","I've always found Howard Hawk's ""Land of the Pharoahs"" a masterful production full of pagentry, excitment, colour, intrigue and also a bit of a history lesson. Far from being the empty spectacle that alot of people dimiss it as, I feel the story being told is done in an intelligent and informative way that is an excellent introduction to this era of Egyptian history.Famed director Howard Hawks assembled excellent expertise in every aspect of this production from stars, production team, costumne designers down to location scouts and the film is a testament to all of their efforts. I think the intelligent way Hawks has gone about depicting the building of the great Pyramid in particular is most impressive. It is the centrepiece around which the whole story revolves and at times it takes on an almost documentary feel as it shows the painstacking attention to detail that went into the planning and then construction of the Great Pyramid over many years.Hawks chose most suitably appropiate people to fill this huge story. Jack Hawkins I feel is excellent as the Pharoah Cheops. In his autobiography Hawkins dismisses the film as a whole as "" a waste of time"" but I feel he is being overly harsh in his assessment and he really lends a very commanding an totally authentic air to his depiction of the Pharoah who moves a nation to create a home for his own eternal life. I feel a special credit must also go to Joan Collins who excels as the wicked Princess Nellifer who arrives at Pharoah's court as part of the tribute from the isle of Cyprus and through her own machinations, which include seduction and murder,  ends up the sole Queen of Egypt. She is both exotically seductive and evil as the queen and adds a wonderful element to the proceedings. The excellent conclusion to the film where she gets her just rewards (I wont reveal what actually happens for the benefit of those who haven't seen the film)is terrific and a total surprise.As with most 1950's epics the supporting cast is top notch and Greek actor Alex Minotis deserves special mention for his dignified playing of Hamar, Pharoahs life long friend and trusted advisor who choses to go into the next life with his master. James Robertson Justice as the architect of the Pyramid also adds much to the films authentic flavour in his efforts to create a robber proof eternal resting place for the Egyptian ruler.The visual look of the film is breathtaking with many months of location shooting in Egypt in intense heat greatly adding to the overraul look of the film. It is easy nowadays to dismiss films such as this, so numerous in the 1950's, as pure hokum but I believe this film is worthy of a far better press than it obtains. The thought of how much this type of production would cost to produce nowadays, both in time and effort, is astronomical and considering the limitations of the time this effort is magnificent.""Land of the Pharoahs"" is a wonderful excursion back to not only another period of history but back to another period of film making when computers were not available to do alot of the work it now takes to produce a film. The sheer human effort alone should win your admiration for this production any time you view it.",4,Lavish 1950's Historical Epic Starring A Perfectly Cast Joan Collins,1021334400,"05 14, 2002",2002,3218,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'Howard', 'Hawk', 'Land', 'Pharoahs', 'masterful', 'production', 'full', 'pagentry', 'excitment', 'colour', 'intrigue', 'also', 'bit', 'history', 'lesson', 'Far', 'being', 'empty', 'spectacle', 'alot', 'people', 'dimiss', 'feel', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'done', 'intelligent', 'informative', 'way', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'era', 'Egyptian', 'history.Famed', 'director', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'assembled', 'excellent', 'expertise', 'aspect', 'production', 'stars', 'production', 'team', 'costumne', 'designers', 'down', 'location', 'scouts', 'film', 'testament', 'efforts', 'think', 'intelligent', 'way', 'Hawks', 'gone', 'depicting', 'building', 'great', 'Pyramid', 'particular', 'most', 'impressive', 'centrepiece', 'whole', 'story', 'revolves', 'times', 'almost', 'documentary', 'feel', 'painstacking', 'attention', 'detail', 'went', 'planning', 'then', 'construction', 'Great', 'Pyramid', 'many', 'years.Hawks', 'chose', 'most', 'suitably', 'appropiate', 'people', 'fill', 'huge', 'story', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'feel', 'excellent', 'Pharoah', 'Cheops', 'autobiography', 'film', 'whole', 'waste', 'time', 'feel', 'being', 'overly', 'harsh', 'assessment', 'really', 'very', 'commanding', 'totally', 'authentic', 'air', 'depiction', 'Pharoah', 'who', 'nation', 'create', 'home', 'own', 'eternal', 'life', 'feel', 'special', 'credit', 'must', 'also', 'go', 'Joan', 'Collins', 'who', 'wicked', 'Princess', 'Nellifer', 'who', 'Pharoah', 'court', 'part', 'tribute', 'isle', 'Cyprus', 'own', 'machinations', 'include', 'seduction', 'murder', 'up', 'sole', 'Queen', 'Egypt', 'exotically', 'seductive', 'evil', 'queen', 'wonderful', 'element', 'proceedings', 'excellent', 'conclusion', 'film', 'where', 'just', 'rewards', 'wont', 'reveal', 'what', 'actually', 'benefit', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'terrific', 'total', 'surprise.As', 'most', '1950', 'epics', 'supporting', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'Greek', 'actor', 'Alex', 'Minotis', 'special', 'mention', 'dignified', 'playing', 'Hamar', 'Pharoahs', 'life', 'long', 'friend', 'trusted', 'advisor', 'who', 'go', 'next', 'life', 'master', 'James', 'Robertson', 'Justice', 'architect', 'Pyramid', 'also', 'much', 'films', 'authentic', 'flavour', 'efforts', 'create', 'robber', 'proof', 'eternal', 'resting', 'place', 'Egyptian', 'ruler.The', 'visual', 'look', 'film', 'breathtaking', 'many', 'months', 'location', 'shooting', 'Egypt', 'intense', 'heat', 'greatly', 'adding', 'overraul', 'look', 'film', 'easy', 'nowadays', 'dismiss', 'films', 'such', 'so', 'numerous', '1950', 'pure', 'hokum', 'believe', 'film', 'worthy', 'far', 'better', 'press', 'thought', 'how', 'much', 'type', 'production', 'would', 'cost', 'produce', 'nowadays', 'time', 'effort', 'astronomical', 'considering', 'limitations', 'time', 'effort', 'magnificent', 'Land', 'Pharoahs', 'wonderful', 'excursion', 'back', 'not', 'only', 'period', 'history', 'back', 'period', 'film', 'making', 'when', 'computers', 'were', 'not', 'available', 'do', 'alot', 'work', 'now', 'produce', 'film', 'sheer', 'human', 'effort', 'alone', 'should', 'win', 'admiration', 'production', 'time', 'view']",N/A
