I very seldom watch a movie during the day, let alone turn on the television, but after reading the title on the menu guide, I thought I would give the movie a try.The Paranormal Hour begins with a seventeen-year-old Sarah Landon (played by Rissa Walters) returning to Pine Valley, California to visit her grandmother, Thelma Shaw. Before she arrives at her grandma's, she has car problems and stops by a local repair shop where she hears part of a disturbing story. She doesn't get the full story until she asks her grandma about it, who was more than glad to tell the tale.A young man, David Baker, is cursed! On his 21st birthday, which is only a few days away, he will be killed by his dead uncle, Ben Woods. Years ago, Ben's son, on his 21st birthday, was killed in a car accident that David's mother caused. David was known as a good kid and was getting ready to go to college, but then he learned of the curse and cut himself off from the world. He has become obsessed with the paranormal, and is trying to find away to stop his uncle.As his 21st birthday nears, his bother, Matt, and his new friend Sarah Landon try to prevent his death.Sarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour was released in limited theaters back in 2007 running only at 81 minutes, and was a complete flop at the box-office. I never remembered the movie ever being released in theaters, let alone every seeing it advertised. The ghost curse plot seems to be interesting, but the movie is ruined with bad actors with horrible dialogue, bad camera shots, and not enough action for a paranormal story. Rissa Walters who played Sarah Landon gave the only decent performance, but she is held back by the untalented co-stars. I felt like I was watching a bad TV-Movie rather than a theatrical release. I wonder if they used a first draft script instead of a final one. I sat there for 80 minutes, as I had to find out how it ended, only for the movie to end in somewhat of a cliffhanger, in which the producers were hopping to make Sarah Landon into a film franchise.I would only recommend the movie to families, as there is no bad language and nudity. There is some mild PG violence in it. It could be a good way to introduce a clean-cut haunting movie to your kids. Overall, I liked the premise, but I will never watch it again.",3,"Interesting Plot Held Back by Bad Acting, a First-Draft Screenplay, and an Amateur Director",1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,2397,"['Last', 'week', 'happened', 'catch', 'movie', 'Sarah', 'Landon', 'Paranormal', 'Hour', 'Encore', 'channel', 'very', 'seldom', 'watch', 'movie', 'day', 'let', 'alone', 'turn', 'television', 'reading', 'title', 'menu', 'guide', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'try.The', 'Paranormal', 'Hour', 'seventeen-year-old', 'Sarah', 'Landon', 'played', 'Rissa', 'Walters', 'returning', 'Pine', 'Valley', 'California', 'visit', 'grandmother', 'Thelma', 'Shaw', 'grandma', 'car', 'problems', 'stops', 'local', 'repair', 'shop', 'where', 'part', 'disturbing', 'story', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'story', 'grandma', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'glad', 'tell', 'tale.A', 'young', 'man', 'David', 'Baker', 'cursed', '21st', 'birthday', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'away', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'dead', 'uncle', 'Ben', 'Woods', 'Years', 'ago', 'Ben', 'son', '21st', 'birthday', 'was', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'David', 'mother', 'caused', 'David', 'was', 'known', 'good', 'kid', 'was', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'college', 'then', 'learned', 'curse', 'cut', 'off', 'world', 'become', 'obsessed', 'paranormal', 'trying', 'find', 'away', 'stop', 'uncle.As', '21st', 'birthday', 'nears', 'bother', 'Matt', 'new', 'friend', 'Sarah', 'Landon', 'try', 'prevent', 'death.Sarah', 'Landon', 'Paranormal', 'Hour', 'was', 'released', 'limited', 'theaters', 'back', '2007', 'running', 'only', '81', 'minutes', 'was', 'complete', 'flop', 'box-office', 'never', 'remembered', 'movie', 'ever', 'being', 'released', 'theaters', 'let', 'alone', 'seeing', 'advertised', 'ghost', 'curse', 'plot', 'be', 'interesting', 'movie', 'ruined', 'bad', 'actors', 'horrible', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'camera', 'shots', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'paranormal', 'story', 'Rissa', 'Walters', 'who', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Landon', 'gave', 'only', 'decent', 'performance', 'held', 'back', 'untalented', 'co-stars', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'bad', 'TV-Movie', 'rather', 'theatrical', 'release', 'wonder', 'used', 'first', 'draft', 'script', 'instead', 'final', 'one', 'sat', '80', 'minutes', 'had', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'ended', 'only', 'movie', 'end', 'somewhat', 'cliffhanger', 'producers', 'were', 'hopping', 'make', 'Sarah', 'Landon', 'film', 'franchise.I', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', 'families', 'bad', 'language', 'nudity', 'mild', 'PG', 'violence', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'way', 'introduce', 'clean-cut', 'haunting', 'movie', 'kids', 'Overall', 'liked', 'premise', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'again']",Sarah Landon & The Paranormal Hour

Bagula""","[0, 0]","The scene where the guy is sitting inside a circle of turnips shaped like sculls with candles in them in a Halloween mask is worth the watching of this one ( supposed Druid ritual?).  The ""crazy"" brother is almost over the top enough. The costuming of the lead  leaves something to be desired.For me the romance between the lead and the younger brother should have had more tension or pathos ( something more?)? The spirit villain isn't really scary enough and the sleep walking lady isn't very convincing as a threat?For me this looks like a lot of first timer errorsin casting and costumes. For instance if the ghost had blood coming out his ears or something, it would have upped the tension level?The location was pretty good and the old houses were nice:actually more realistic than a lot of Hollywood products.",3,Kind of a clunky ghost story,1244160000,"06 5, 2009",2009,816,"['scene', 'where', 'guy', 'sitting', 'circle', 'turnips', 'shaped', 'sculls', 'candles', 'Halloween', 'mask', 'watching', 'one', 'supposed', 'Druid', 'ritual', 'crazy', 'brother', 'almost', 'top', 'enough', 'costuming', 'lead', 'something', 'be', 'desired.For', 'romance', 'lead', 'younger', 'brother', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'tension', 'pathos', 'something', 'more', 'spirit', 'villain', ""n't"", 'really', 'scary', 'enough', 'sleep', 'walking', 'lady', ""n't"", 'very', 'convincing', 'threat', 'lot', 'first', 'timer', 'errorsin', 'casting', 'costumes', 'instance', 'ghost', 'had', 'blood', 'coming', 'out', 'ears', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'upped', 'tension', 'level', 'location', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'old', 'houses', 'were', 'nice', 'actually', 'more', 'realistic', 'lot', 'Hollywood', 'products']",Sarah Landon & The Paranormal Hour
1173109,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001BPJJ8W,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","Hackneyed storytelling and insipid performances are the hallmarks of ""Sarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour,"" an amateur-hour supernatural thriller that has all the professionalism and polish of an F-earning junior high school film project.Sarah (Rissa Walters) is a 17-year-old girl who goes to stay with her recently deceased best friend's grandmother in a small mountain town in California. The minute she arrives at the place, she's plunged into a mind-numbing mystery story involving curses, avenging spirits, and a whole raft of poorly staged flashback sequences.The actors read their lines as if they'd never performed for an audience before, either on stage or in front of a camera - which may indeed be the case with some of them - and Lisa Comrie demonstrates no more confidence or competence as a director than the performers do as actors.""Paranormal Hour"" was the first in what was intended to be a series of mystery films with the Nancy Drew-like Sarah Landon character as the protagonist.
