1231641,A2CKO47KWC90A0,B001QOGYBI,"10-yr-old Movie Critic ""Perry's Previews""","[1, 2]","The following review was published on ""We Chinese in America"" newspaper and [...]--------------Who do you think will win in a battle of will and wit, man or animal? Mr. Fox, who looks like a businessman in a smartly tailored suit, is the leader of the animal team in the 2-D stop-motion animated feature ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox.""  A few years ago, he had promised his short-tempered wife, Mrs. Fox who was pregnant at the time, to never steal a chicken or livestock ever again after they were trapped in a cage while attempting to steal a chicken.  Mr. Fox then became a columnist for the animal newspaper, but with paltry readership.  His wild animal instinct yearned to be in the action and dodge danger.Mr. Fox sneakily stole food and chickens from the meanest farmers in the neighborhood, Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.  Boggis, owner of a chicken farm, is very large and eats three chickens each for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert, that is 12 chickens a day!Bunce is the size of a dwarf.  His head would be submerged in the shallow end of a swimming pool.  He eats doughnuts with goose liver injected into them.  That may sound disgusting, but goose liver is a great delicacy, and Bunce doesn't seem to know that.Bean is as skinny as a pencil and the meanest of the three.  He makes distilled hard cider with his genetically engineered apples.  He drinks only cider, and leads the human army in the man vs. animal war.Mrs. Fox finally found out about Mr. Fox's hidden activities, but worse yet, the farmers plotted an epic revenge.  Mr. Fox must assemble an army of animals and use his wit, strategic thinking, and wild animal spirit to win the battle.In the fox family, there is also a ""small one,"" Ash.  He is the only son, I mean cub.  He is a problem child, because he is not confident and always wears a strange outfit - a cape.  Ash is distant from everyone because he feels deprived of love and attention from his scheming dad.When Ash's cousin Kristofferson comes to stay with the Fox family, Ash is jealous of Kristofferson's many talents: yoga, graceful diving, and excellent sportsmanship in the complicated game of whackbat.  Intense ""cousin rivalry"" ensued.I noticed that while the mammals such as Mr. Fox talked in the movie, the chickens did not.  I thought maybe if the chickens did talk, Mr. Fox would feel sympathy and not eat them.  But Mr. Fox spoke English just like the farmers, and the farmers still wanted to kill him.  Also, the rat who guarded Bean's cider cellar told Mr. Fox that his dying wish was to taste Bean's cider, but I saw the rat sipping the very cider contentedly with a long straw earlier in the film!My mom once saw a fox pulling a dead fox off of a road so that cars would not drive through the dead fox.  They were like Mr. Fox in looks, but were not clothed and could not talk or walk on two legs.  They were not afraid of humans.  My mom was impressed by their caring for each other.I give this movie four starfish.  It is about friendship, wit, trickery, and strategy.  I like the visual style of the film.  The fur looks so real, it moves when the animals talk or have facial expressions.After watching the film, I read the book from which this movie is based, that was originally published in 1970, a children's book classic.  The author Roald Nahl has good drawings though his sketch is somewhat blurry.  I like the movie better because the characters are richer.  There are new characters like Ash and Kristofferson in the movie that made the family dynamics more interesting.  The visuals are more vivid and the story is funnier in the movie.My favorite character is Mr. Fox.  He is witty, smart, and charming.  He is a messy eater who wolfs down his food.  Mr. Fox is not careful and his strategies often backfire, because he thinks only of the thrill and reward, not of the risk and consequences of his actions.  One of the early scenes showed Mr. Fox using blueberries with crude anesthesia to drug the beagles guarding Boggis's chicken house.  When Mr. Fox and his helper the opossum stole a chicken, sirens flashed and gave away their identity, they scrambled over the electric fence, being shocked all the way!My favorite scene is when Mr. Fox raised his paw and the silhouetted wolf raised his too, in recognition of brotherhood and wild animal spirit.  This is also the funniest scene.Before taking risks, think about not only the rewards, but also the consequences.Fantastic Mr. Fox (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)",4,"A Battle of Will & Wit, Man & Animals, Risks & Rewards",1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,4493,"['following', 'review', 'was', 'published', 'Chinese', 'America', 'newspaper', '[', ']', 'Who', 'do', 'think', 'will', 'win', 'battle', 'will', 'wit', 'man', 'animal', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'who', 'businessman', 'smartly', 'tailored', 'suit', 'leader', 'animal', 'team', '2-D', 'stop-motion', 'animated', 'feature', 'Fantastic', 'Mr', 'Fox', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'promised', 'short-tempered', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Fox', 'who', 'was', 'pregnant', 'time', 'never', 'steal', 'chicken', 'livestock', 'ever', 'again', 'were', 'trapped', 'cage', 'attempting', 'steal', 'chicken', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'then', 'became', 'columnist', 'animal', 'newspaper', 'paltry', 'readership', 'wild', 'animal', 'instinct', 'yearned', 'be', 'action', 'dodge', 'danger.Mr', 'Fox', 'sneakily', 'stole', 'food', 'chickens', 'meanest', 'farmers', 'neighborhood', 'Boggis', 'Bunce', 'Bean', 'Boggis', 'owner', 'chicken', 'farm', 'very', 'large', 'eats', 'three', 'chickens', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'dessert', '12', 'chickens', 'day', 'Bunce', 'size', 'dwarf', 'head', 'would', 'be', 'submerged', 'shallow', 'end', 'swimming', 'pool', 'doughnuts', 'goose', 'liver', 'injected', 'may', 'sound', 'disgusting', 'goose', 'liver', 'great', 'delicacy', 'Bunce', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'that.Bean', 'as', 'skinny', 'pencil', 'meanest', 'three', 'distilled', 'hard', 'cider', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'apples', 'only', 'cider', 'human', 'army', 'man', 'vs.', 'animal', 'war.Mrs', 'Fox', 'finally', 'found', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'hidden', 'activities', 'worse', 'yet', 'farmers', 'plotted', 'epic', 'revenge', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'must', 'assemble', 'army', 'animals', 'use', 'wit', 'strategic', 'thinking', 'wild', 'animal', 'spirit', 'win', 'battle.In', 'fox', 'family', 'also', 'small', 'one', 'Ash', 'only', 'son', 'mean', 'cub', 'problem', 'child', 'not', 'confident', 'always', 'strange', 'outfit', 'cape', 'Ash', 'distant', 'everyone', 'deprived', 'love', 'attention', 'scheming', 'dad.When', 'Ash', 'cousin', 'Kristofferson', 'stay', 'Fox', 'family', 'Ash', 'jealous', 'Kristofferson', 'many', 'talents', 'yoga', 'graceful', 'diving', 'excellent', 'sportsmanship', 'complicated', 'game', 'whackbat', 'Intense', 'cousin', 'rivalry', 'ensued.I', 'noticed', 'mammals', 'such', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'talked', 'movie', 'chickens', 'did', 'not', 'thought', 'maybe', 'chickens', 'did', 'talk', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'would', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'not', 'eat', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'spoke', 'English', 'just', 'farmers', 'farmers', 'still', 'wanted', 'kill', 'Also', 'rat', 'who', 'guarded', 'Bean', 'cider', 'cellar', 'told', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'dying', 'wish', 'was', 'taste', 'Bean', 'cider', 'saw', 'rat', 'sipping', 'very', 'cider', 'contentedly', 'long', 'straw', 'earlier', 'film', 'mom', 'once', 'saw', 'fox', 'pulling', 'dead', 'fox', 'road', 'cars', 'would', 'not', 'drive', 'dead', 'fox', 'were', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'looks', 'were', 'not', 'clothed', 'could', 'not', 'talk', 'walk', 'two', 'legs', 'were', 'not', 'afraid', 'humans', 'mom', 'was', 'impressed', 'caring', 'other.I', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'starfish', 'friendship', 'wit', 'trickery', 'strategy', 'visual', 'style', 'film', 'fur', 'looks', 'so', 'real', 'when', 'animals', 'talk', 'have', 'facial', 'expressions.After', 'watching', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'was', 'originally', 'published', '1970', 'children', 'book', 'classic', 'author', 'Roald', 'Nahl', 'good', 'drawings', 'sketch', 'somewhat', 'blurry', 'movie', 'better', 'characters', 'are', 'richer', 'are', 'new', 'characters', 'Ash', 'Kristofferson', 'movie', 'made', 'family', 'dynamics', 'more', 'interesting', 'visuals', 'are', 'more', 'vivid', 'story', 'funnier', 'movie.My', 'favorite', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'witty', 'smart', 'charming', 'messy', 'eater', 'who', 'wolfs', 'down', 'food', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'not', 'careful', 'strategies', 'often', 'backfire', 'only', 'thrill', 'reward', 'not', 'risk', 'consequences', 'actions', 'One', 'early', 'scenes', 'showed', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'using', 'blueberries', 'crude', 'anesthesia', 'drug', 'beagles', 'guarding', 'Boggis', 'chicken', 'house', 'When', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'helper', 'opossum', 'stole', 'chicken', 'sirens', 'flashed', 'gave', 'away', 'identity', 'scrambled', 'electric', 'fence', 'being', 'shocked', 'way', 'favorite', 'scene', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'raised', 'paw', 'silhouetted', 'wolf', 'raised', 'too', 'recognition', 'brotherhood', 'wild', 'animal', 'spirit', 'also', 'funniest', 'scene.Before', 'taking', 'risks', 'think', 'not', 'only', 'rewards', 'also', 'consequences.Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'Three-Disc', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

Supporting him is an absolutely all-star cast: a patient but fiery wife, a hilariously neglected and disgruntled son, a delightful ""straight man"" nephew well versed in karate, and a dozen other quirky and three-dimensional forest friends.As cliche as it may sound, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" feels almost more like an experience than a movie - a lot of ""day in the life"" scenes are shown that are worthwhile and hilarious in their own right, even as they pertain to the plot later in this convoluted and fantastic voyage. Character development is just as humorous and ties in wonderfully with the advancement of the overall plot, or rather plots - since the ""plot"" changes and twists multiple times over the course of the movie from the initial heists, to their consequences, to daring fights and rescues, and finally to a new way of life for everyone to adjust to.This movie is a delightful experience - and is one of the few movies that my family insisted on watching twice in a row!~ Ana Mardoll",5,Fantastic Movie,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,1375,"['Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', '/', 'B001QOGYBIOne', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'perfect', 'combination', 'amusing', 'plot', 'superb', 'voice', 'acting', 'talent', 'wonderful', 'animation.George', 'Clooney', 'perfectly', 'dryly', 'family', 'man', 'fox', 'who', 'longing', 'carefree', 'heists', 'youth', 'elaborate', 'three-prong', 'attack', 'local', 'farmers', 'larders', 'Supporting', 'absolutely', 'all-star', 'cast', 'patient', 'fiery', 'wife', 'hilariously', 'neglected', 'disgruntled', 'son', 'delightful', 'straight', 'man', 'nephew', 'well', 'versed', 'karate', 'dozen', 'other', 'quirky', 'three-dimensional', 'forest', 'friends.As', 'cliche', 'may', 'sound', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'almost', 'more', 'experience', 'movie', 'lot', 'day', 'life', 'scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'hilarious', 'own', 'right', 'even', 'pertain', 'plot', 'later', 'convoluted', 'fantastic', 'voyage', 'Character', 'development', 'just', 'as', 'humorous', 'ties', 'wonderfully', 'advancement', 'overall', 'plot', 'rather', 'plots', 'plot', 'changes', 'multiple', 'times', 'course', 'movie', 'initial', 'heists', 'consequences', 'daring', 'fights', 'rescues', 'finally', 'new', 'way', 'life', 'everyone', 'adjust', 'to.This', 'movie', 'delightful', 'experience', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'family', 'insisted', 'watching', 'twice', 'row', '~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

However, I found the animation very distracting.I realize stop-frame (model) animation is nearly as challenging as drawn animation, and I admire anyone who takes it on. But for a big-budget, professional production, I found the animation so distractingly unlifelike I couldn't relax and enjoy the story.And is it just my imagination, or did they use a lower animation framerate (number of frames per second) than usual, to limit production costs? That would account for some of the jerkiness, though not all of it.(By contrast, the characters in the ""Wallace and Gromit"" features are much less sophisticated, yet they're so well-animated I have no trouble suspending my disbelief and enjoying them.)As if that weren't distracting enough, these characters are covered with fur.

1231657,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,B001QOGYBI,Andrea Polk,"[1, 1]","Fantastic Mr. Fox, a children's book by Roald Dahl, is the basis for this stop animation film featuring the voices of George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox.  A good choice for an entertaining family film, but some of the humor will go over younger viewers heads.  Where adults would say a 'bad word', the writers have the characters simply say 'cuss'.  As an adult viewing the film, I found this really funny because my head naturally put to mind what words 'I' would use in a similar situation!Overall Fantastic Mr. Fox is a cute story of about a fox who upon learning of his wife's pregnancy with their first kit agrees to give up his profession ""stealing chickens"" and settle down into a more sedate life as a columnist.  All is well until 12 fox years later when Mr. Fox becomes unsettled by his 'poor' lifestyle and decides to go against the promise that he made to his wife.  He convinces his landlord (a possum) to join him in a heist, and it feels so go he goes for another... and another... and another.  Eventually this risky behavior puts Mr. Fox, his family and the other friends (creatures who share his life) in danger from the three disgruntled farmers from whom he's been stealing.The animation is different than anything in recent memory and a nice divergence from the digital animation we are all now used to viewing.  It's neat to see the animals fur and feel like you could touch it.  It's also kind of weird to see them run and get taller and/or smaller depending upon the scene, but after awhile you get used it it and immerse yourself in the story.Fun music, sharp dialogue done by actors we love, a fun story done in a new way, made Fantastic Mr. Fox an enjoyable movie for my family.

1231659,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001QOGYBI,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 6]","I haven't seen a lot of films by Wes Anderson.  I've seen (and loved) `The Royal Tenenbaums' and I saw (and found highly overrated) `Rushmore'.  Even with only those two viewings though, it is apparent that Anderson has a unique style, visually as well as vocally.  His humor is very dry to the point where he is either astonishingly clever or almost too gimmicky.Ok, forget it.  I was going to go into this longwinded (as usual) spiel about how Wes Anderson's style is apparent all over this film, but in a good way, but I'm getting too impatient.All I want to say is, ""THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC""!If you know me then you know that I don't normally get overly excited about animated films.  Sure, there are the occasional animated features that really reach me, but as a rule I'm not entirely drawn to them.  There was something about this film though, that grabbed me from the first promo I saw.  I just knew that I HAD TO SEE THIS!  I took my daughter (my wife refused to go) and I liked it more than she did (to be fair, this is a very adult cartoon with mature humor and a bland color palate that fails to ignite the interest of a toddler).  This is not you average `laugh out loud' type of comedy, but if you are familiar with Anderson then you know that that is not his style.This humor is subtle yet totally spot on.The story is that of Mr. Fox, a retired chicken thief who has settled into the life of husband and father, yet he still feels that aching need for adventure.  When Mr. Fox attempts to get his thrills in by stealing from three very nasty men, he finds that these men will stop at nothing to destroy Mr. Fox and his family.The voice work couldn't have been better.  The deadpan delivery suits comic actors like Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman effortlessly, but even George Clooney and Meryl Streep fall beautifully into line.  Anderson's direction captures the humor in every scene, and his ascetic is seen all over the place, to glorious effect.  I'd easily say that Schwartzman is best in show (I never thought I'd ever say that about him).  His voice work totally embodies his character (Ash is just such a brilliant creation) to the point where his every word and action is undeniably unforgettable.I will say this, the film is not really one I'd recommend for young children, you know, when they are going through that `impressionable stage'.  Some of the dialog, while not explicit, could be objectionable to parents.  If you don't want your children running around using the word `cuss' in place of colorful expressions you might want to keep them away from this.  This is a Roald Dahl adaptation, so the darker themes are to be expected (there are some deaths on screen and some malicious violence), but they are handled with wit and cleverness (that ""soap"" line is priceless).I totally recommend this for any adult willing to embrace his inner child!",5,This is totally cussing fantastic!,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,2880,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'films', 'Wes', 'Anderson', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'loved', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'saw', 'found', 'highly', 'overrated', 'Rushmore', 'Even', 'only', 'two', 'viewings', 'apparent', 'Anderson', 'unique', 'style', 'visually', 'as', 'well', 'vocally', 'humor', 'very', 'dry', 'point', 'where', 'either', 'astonishingly', 'clever', 'almost', 'too', 'gimmicky.Ok', 'forget', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'longwinded', 'usual', 'spiel', 'how', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'style', 'apparent', 'all', 'film', 'good', 'way', ""'m"", 'getting', 'too', 'impatient.All', 'want', 'say', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'IS', 'FANTASTIC', 'know', 'then', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'get', 'overly', 'excited', 'animated', 'films', 'Sure', 'are', 'occasional', 'animated', 'features', 'really', 'reach', 'rule', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'drawn', 'was', 'something', 'film', 'grabbed', 'first', 'promo', 'saw', 'just', 'knew', 'HAD', 'TO', 'SEE', 'THIS', 'took', 'daughter', 'wife', 'refused', 'go', 'liked', 'more', 'did', 'be', 'fair', 'very', 'adult', 'cartoon', 'mature', 'humor', 'bland', 'color', 'palate', 'ignite', 'interest', 'toddler', 'not', 'average', 'laugh', 'loud', 'type', 'comedy', 'are', 'familiar', 'Anderson', 'then', 'know', 'not', 'style.This', 'humor', 'subtle', 'yet', 'totally', 'spot', 'on.The', 'story', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'retired', 'chicken', 'thief', 'who', 'settled', 'life', 'husband', 'father', 'yet', 'still', 'aching', 'need', 'adventure', 'When', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'get', 'thrills', 'stealing', 'three', 'very', 'nasty', 'men', 'men', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'destroy', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'family.The', 'voice', 'work', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'suits', 'comic', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'effortlessly', 'even', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'fall', 'beautifully', 'line', 'Anderson', 'direction', 'humor', 'scene', 'ascetic', 'seen', 'place', 'glorious', 'effect', ""'d"", 'easily', 'say', 'Schwartzman', 'best', 'show', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'ever', 'say', 'about', 'voice', 'work', 'totally', 'character', 'Ash', 'just', 'such', 'brilliant', 'creation', 'point', 'where', 'word', 'action', 'undeniably', 'unforgettable.I', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'one', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'young', 'children', 'know', 'when', 'are', 'going', 'impressionable', 'stage', 'dialog', 'not', 'explicit', 'could', 'be', 'objectionable', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'children', 'running', 'around', 'using', 'word', 'cuss', 'place', 'colorful', 'expressions', 'might', 'want', 'keep', 'away', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'adaptation', 'darker', 'themes', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'are', 'deaths', 'screen', 'malicious', 'violence', 'are', 'handled', 'wit', 'cleverness', 'soap', 'line', 'priceless', '.I', 'totally', 'recommend', 'adult', 'willing', 'embrace', 'inner', 'child']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

I'd heard and known about the inventiveness of The Fantastic Mr. Fox's stop-action animation.

Nor was I prepared for just how brilliant the vocal characterizations were.  I hope George Clooney got some type of award for this film, because, wow, what a performance.  The character he gives his 'Mr. Fox' -- hard to put your finger on exactly how he did it, but his mere voice gives our hero equal bits of dash, street smarts, world-weariness and hope for a better future. Bravo.Three memories which had me doubled-up with laughter on my flight:The tree-, er, house-buying strategy session with badger (and lawyer, natch) Bill Murray - the ""Are you cussing with me""? scene - which quickly devolves into animal behavior until a well-timed 'ding' off the carriage return of Murray's deadpan secretary defuses the hostile atmosphere.Owen Wilson's inimitable intonations dispassionately rattling off the arcane rules of the sport of 'Whackbat.'Clooney's Mr. Fox having a understated breakfast conversation with his wife (an equally sublime performance from Meryl Streep), concluding his point in very human-like fashion, then...ravenously demolishing his waffles like you'd imagine a fox doing given the opportunity.

1231662,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B001QOGYBI,Armando N. Roman,"[1, 2]","I'll admit that I'm not exactly a fan of Wes Anderson's movies. The only film of his that I've seen is The Royal Tenenbaums (at age 16 when it hit theaters), and when I worked at a movie store, his other films were constantly being brought up by a bunch of hipster kids that would refuse to watch anything 'mainstream'. So when it was announced that Fantastic Mr. Fox was going to be directed by Anderson, I was a bit worried. Fortunately, this movie had me hooked within the first 10 minutes. Not only is the movie interesting, but it has gorgeous art direction, fantastic voice acting by everyone involved, and the animation is rough. Normally I'd be disappointed by that, but the style matches everything perfectly.Mr. Fox is basically having a mid-life crisis. When the story starts out, he and his wife are caught in a cage when on a run to steal chickens from a farm. After finding out that they're going to have a child, Mr. Fox promises that if they make it out of the cage, he'll stop his ways and live a safer life. He does so, for a while at least, making his living as a newspaper columnist. But once the family moves into a new home and he discovers 3 farms run by 3 of the meanest men out there: Boggis, Bunce and Bean. The urge to live dangerously kicks back in, and he quickly raids them of their chickens, geese and apple cider, only to be tracked back to his home, which puts his family and the other animals nearby in danger. At the same time, his nephew Kristofferson has moved in, and is making his son Ash jealous in every possible way, mainly because Kristofferson is perfect. Things look bad, but Mr. Fox always has a plan, and needs to try his best to figure out how to take care of the 3 farmers.One of the best things that the movie has going for it is that it doesn't talk down to the audience, and that it can be viewed by people of all ages. There's a little bit of violence from short fight scenes and guns, but I don't remember seeing a single drop of blood, even when someone gets scratched by another animal. I loved that the animation style was on the rough side, and not fluid like The Corpse Bride, as it just feels right for the movie. Fur and clothing move from frame to frame, a process that the crew calls 'boiling', and was picked up from the original King Kong. Every major character was interesting, and this is one of the few movies where I was cheering for the main character from start to finish. Little mannerisms of characters, from trademark whistles and clicks, to the sudden savage growling when eating a meal...it's all great. The tone of the movie stays the same too- it's light and comical. That might also be my only complaint. Everything's taken so lightly that there wasn't much of a threat from the 3 farmers, even at the very end where the climax is over just as quickly as it began. At the same time, it would've been odd to make things dramatic all of a sudden, but I would've liked more time with the farmers and seen just how mean they could be, instead of the leader of the bunch getting a few small outbursts.The special features are on the light side, with under an hour of material to go through. You get the standard trailer, a minute long fake documentary on Whack-Bat, and a couple of featurettes going over the making of the movie and a short interview with Roald Dahl's widow, who genuinely praises Anderson and the crew for making a movie that she thinks her husband would've approved of. I enjoyed the 40+ minute behind the scenes look where you get a good idea of just how time consuming stop motion is, even if you're already aware of how much time goes into it. One animator reveals that to film an 18 second scene, she spent 8 or 9 days on everything. That's just crazy, and I have nothing but the highest respect for the animators, puppet makers, set and prop designers...everyone. It was also great to see how they recorded the voices for everyone: going on location to a farm, with one microphone around everyone at the same time. If the characters in the movie were out of breath after running, the actors would be too, and it makes things much more real. It'd be nice to have a commentary track on here, but I guess this is one of those cases where the director lets the film speak for itself.I highly recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox to fans of animation or anyone looking for a unique family movie. The whole movie is a visual treat, with all the autumn colors, and it features a fast paced story that never drags on. I just might check out Anderson's other movies now.",4,Beagles love blueberries.,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,4550,"[""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'fan', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'only', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'age', '16', 'when', 'hit', 'theaters', 'when', 'worked', 'movie', 'store', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'constantly', 'being', 'brought', 'up', 'bunch', 'hipster', 'kids', 'would', 'refuse', 'watch', 'anything', ""'mainstream"", 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'directed', 'Anderson', 'was', 'bit', 'worried', 'Fortunately', 'movie', 'had', 'hooked', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'interesting', 'gorgeous', 'art', 'direction', 'fantastic', 'voice', 'acting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'animation', 'rough', 'Normally', ""'d"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'style', 'matches', 'everything', 'perfectly.Mr', 'Fox', 'basically', 'having', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'When', 'story', 'out', 'wife', 'are', 'caught', 'cage', 'when', 'run', 'steal', 'chickens', 'farm', 'finding', 'out', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'child', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'make', 'cage', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'ways', 'live', 'safer', 'life', 'so', 'while', 'least', 'making', 'living', 'newspaper', 'columnist', 'once', 'family', 'new', 'home', '3', 'farms', 'run', '3', 'meanest', 'men', 'out', 'there', 'Boggis', 'Bunce', 'Bean', 'urge', 'live', 'dangerously', 'back', 'quickly', 'raids', 'chickens', 'geese', 'apple', 'cider', 'only', 'be', 'tracked', 'back', 'home', 'family', 'other', 'animals', 'nearby', 'danger', 'same', 'time', 'nephew', 'Kristofferson', 'moved', 'making', 'son', 'Ash', 'jealous', 'possible', 'way', 'mainly', 'Kristofferson', 'perfect', 'Things', 'look', 'bad', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'always', 'plan', 'try', 'best', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'take', 'care', '3', 'farmers.One', 'best', 'things', 'movie', 'going', ""n't"", 'talk', 'audience', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'people', 'ages', 'little', 'bit', 'violence', 'short', 'fight', 'scenes', 'guns', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'single', 'drop', 'blood', 'even', 'when', 'someone', 'scratched', 'animal', 'loved', 'animation', 'style', 'was', 'rough', 'side', 'not', 'fluid', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'just', 'feels', 'right', 'movie', 'Fur', 'clothing', 'move', 'frame', 'frame', 'process', 'crew', ""'boiling"", 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'original', 'King', 'Kong', 'Every', 'major', 'character', 'was', 'interesting', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'where', 'was', 'cheering', 'main', 'character', 'start', 'finish', 'Little', 'mannerisms', 'characters', 'trademark', 'whistles', 'clicks', 'sudden', 'savage', 'growling', 'when', 'eating', 'meal', 'great', 'tone', 'movie', 'same', 'too-', 'light', 'comical', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'only', 'complaint', 'Everything', 'taken', 'so', 'lightly', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'threat', '3', 'farmers', 'even', 'very', 'end', 'where', 'climax', 'over', 'just', 'as', 'quickly', 'began', 'same', 'time', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'odd', 'make', 'things', 'dramatic', 'sudden', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'more', 'time', 'farmers', 'seen', 'just', 'how', 'mean', 'could', 'be', 'instead', 'leader', 'bunch', 'getting', 'few', 'small', 'outbursts.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'light', 'side', 'hour', 'material', 'go', 'get', 'standard', 'trailer', 'minute', 'long', 'fake', 'documentary', 'Whack-Bat', 'couple', 'featurettes', 'going', 'making', 'movie', 'short', 'interview', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'widow', 'who', 'genuinely', 'Anderson', 'crew', 'making', 'movie', 'husband', 'would', ""'ve"", 'approved', 'enjoyed', '40+', 'minute', 'scenes', 'look', 'where', 'get', 'good', 'idea', 'just', 'how', 'time', 'consuming', 'stop', 'motion', 'even', ""'re"", 'already', 'aware', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'One', 'animator', 'film', '18', 'second', 'scene', 'spent', '8', '9', 'days', 'everything', 'just', 'crazy', 'have', 'nothing', 'highest', 'respect', 'animators', 'puppet', 'makers', 'set', 'prop', 'designers', 'everyone', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'how', 'recorded', 'voices', 'everyone', 'going', 'location', 'farm', 'one', 'microphone', 'everyone', 'same', 'time', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'breath', 'running', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'things', 'much', 'more', 'real', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'commentary', 'track', 'here', 'guess', 'one', 'cases', 'where', 'director', 'film', 'speak', 'itself.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'fans', 'animation', 'anyone', 'looking', 'unique', 'family', 'movie', 'whole', 'movie', 'visual', 'treat', 'autumn', 'colors', 'fast', 'paced', 'story', 'never', 'just', 'might', 'check', 'out', 'Anderson', 'other', 'movies', 'now']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

This is no genius statement, obviously, but it doesn't show up in a lot of movies, except classics, which I'd rate this one.I haven't read through all the other reviews, but I'm sure you know the plot and all that.  I watched it to see if I could use it for a class I'm teaching, looking for that ""theme"" you have to hit when you're a teacher in this climate.  (Fun is not allowed in the college classroom.)  A grand theme is there.  I hate looking for metaphors in literature, a fool's game, but when hit on the head, well, and done with a very insistent feather, a metaphor doesn't hurt.The animals are the underclass, which we get all along, because they wind up way, way underground, trying to just get by, trying to make it with no-income jobs, finally living in the sewers that are ruled by the white rich uberclass.  But of course the underclass survives by theft and pure glee at the prospect of living.  Through scavenging various cultures.  And most of all, through love and companionship.  The movie is as fun and engaging and technically wonderful as everyone says it is, but I do love the subtext a whole lot.  It is all true for us in the lower 98, percentile, that is.Oh, and I about fell down when I saw that the voice of the Rabbit is Mario Batali.

Right from the very beginning you will be surprised and perhaps even sickened by the way the husband and wife fox characters communicate with each other.A good portion of the animation is really strange though, and that's no lie. Strange in a ""What in the world just HAPPENED?"" kind of way. One minute two adult foxes are pretending to talk to each other like a real life husband and wife couple, the next they're frantically digging holes and trying to escape with their lives upon realizing actual people are trying to destroy their habitat by tearing up the forests and ground (and eventually realizing the foxes need to be eliminated which results in more digging and hiding by the animals- this is a constant theme).These foxes actually have personalities and actual problems that are, once again, similar to people. Something about the way the foxes move their lips is really funny and bizarre, but the biggest problem with Fantastic Mr. Fox is that the husband in particular tries to be funny but almost *never* is. Every attempt at humor that comes out of his mouth just stinks.I admire the somewhat large and diverse variety of forest creatures (side characters) that happen to be friends with the fox family, but I don't know, I just didn't find this film particularly humorous and most of the jokes were severely hit and miss.  Most people seem to really like it though so perhaps I'm all alone in this regard.

1231671,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B001QOGYBI,buru buru piggu,"[2, 3]","Fantastic Mr. Fox is stellar example of stop-motion animation and looks fantastic on hi-def. The entire production is richly detailed and painstakingly animated, with a wonderful soundtrack that's as much a part of this film as the furry creatures that inhabit it. It's very nostalgic, beginning with the Ballad of Davy Crockett and includes folk songs from Burt Ives and a selection of pop songs (like the Beach Boys). One climactic scene is punctuated by the Rolling Stones' ""Street Fighting Man"" and it's hard to imagine a better song to go along with the action after hearing it. The rest of the diverse and richly-textured OST(Original Soundtrack)was created by French film composer Alexandre Desplat, consisting of piano, banjos, violin, xylophones, flute, and brass band. It gives the film a magical, golden innocence that's playful, nostalgic and timeless all at the same time, perfectly suited for a children's story. Each song is tailored to the onscreen action and is delightful to listen to. Where Mr. Fox is running free in the fields, the music has the country twang of banjos and springy piano. Every scene with the rat (a villain) ramps up to a spaghetti-westerny twang of guitars and whistling (""Bean's Secret Cider Cellar""), an homage to Ennio Morricone's theme fromThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly. In hi-def, you can really appreciate all the care and attention that went into making this film, including the texture of the fur and clothing the animals wear, the lettering on boxes and labels, and even the writing in newspapers.The story: Mr. Fox is a clever, but reckless chicken thief. He is sly, fast-talking, and persuasive (perhaps even manipulative). This is established from the clever dialog right out the starting gate between him and his wife in the choice of scenic route or shortcut, and method of entry into the squad shack they are about to pilfer (Mr. Fox always gets his choice). During the raid, Mr. and Mrs. Fox get caught in a fox trap (due to Mr. Fox's hubris) as they are about to make off with their loot. She tells him she is pregnant and makes him promise to give up his life of crime should they survive. 2 years go by and he is now a newspaper columnist and a family man, looking to move out of his hole in the ground and into a nicer tree so he doesn't feel so poor. They move into a tree near the farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, three very mean farmers. Mr. Fox plans one last heist with the help of his dimwitted opossum building superintendent, Kylie. One last heist becomes three as Mr. Fox lapses back to his old ways, with each raid getting progressively more daring that the last.Angered by the thefts, the farmers band together to eliminate their pest problem. Eventually, his entire family and all the animals of the forest get roped into the situation because of Mr. Fox's selfishness, in an escalating war brought about by the three men, who are determined to kill Mr. Fox at all costs.Despite the PG rating, I don't feel that this film is suitable for most kids due to the slow pacing and Wes Anderson-styled melancholy that is his trademark. The script feels like it's meant for adults rather than children, despite the origin of this story being a Roald Dahl novel. George Clooney delivers most of his lines in a deadpan, and while there are a few quick action sequences, the film is driven mostly by dialog and is an exploration of family dynamics (husband-wife, father-son, son-nephew). High-school aged audiences may be fine, but this film is certainly not for the under-13 crowd. It's not very kid-friendly stuff and may bore younger viewers.But for adults, it's definitely worth checking out. And get the amazing soundtrack too! 4.5/5 stars.",4,"A fantastic work of art, but can be a bit slow",1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,3708,"['Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'stellar', 'example', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'fantastic', 'hi-def', 'entire', 'production', 'richly', 'detailed', 'painstakingly', 'animated', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'film', 'furry', 'inhabit', 'very', 'nostalgic', 'beginning', 'Ballad', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'folk', 'songs', 'Burt', 'Ives', 'selection', 'pop', 'songs', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'One', 'climactic', 'scene', 'punctuated', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Street', 'Fighting', 'Man', 'hard', 'imagine', 'better', 'song', 'go', 'along', 'action', 'hearing', 'rest', 'diverse', 'richly-textured', 'OST', 'Original', 'Soundtrack', 'was', 'created', 'French', 'film', 'composer', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'consisting', 'piano', 'banjos', 'violin', 'xylophones', 'flute', 'brass', 'band', 'film', 'magical', 'golden', 'innocence', 'playful', 'nostalgic', 'timeless', 'same', 'time', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'children', 'story', 'song', 'tailored', 'onscreen', 'action', 'delightful', 'listen', 'Where', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'running', 'free', 'fields', 'music', 'country', 'twang', 'banjos', 'springy', 'piano', 'scene', 'rat', 'villain', 'up', 'spaghetti-westerny', 'twang', 'guitars', 'whistling', 'Bean', 'Secret', 'Cider', 'Cellar', 'homage', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'theme', 'fromThe', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'hi-def', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'care', 'attention', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'including', 'texture', 'fur', 'clothing', 'animals', 'wear', 'lettering', 'boxes', 'labels', 'even', 'writing', 'newspapers.The', 'story', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'clever', 'reckless', 'chicken', 'thief', 'sly', 'fast-talking', 'persuasive', 'perhaps', 'even', 'manipulative', 'established', 'clever', 'dialog', 'right', 'starting', 'gate', 'wife', 'choice', 'scenic', 'route', 'shortcut', 'method', 'entry', 'squad', 'shack', 'are', 'pilfer', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'always', 'choice', 'raid', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Fox', 'get', 'caught', 'fox', 'trap', 'due', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'hubris', 'are', 'make', 'off', 'loot', 'pregnant', 'promise', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'crime', 'should', 'survive', '2', 'years', 'go', 'now', 'newspaper', 'columnist', 'family', 'man', 'looking', 'move', 'hole', 'ground', 'nicer', 'tree', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'poor', 'move', 'tree', 'farms', 'Boggis', 'Bunce', 'Bean', 'three', 'very', 'mean', 'farmers', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'one', 'last', 'heist', 'help', 'dimwitted', 'opossum', 'building', 'superintendent', 'Kylie', 'One', 'last', 'heist', 'becomes', 'three', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'back', 'old', 'ways', 'raid', 'getting', 'progressively', 'more', 'daring', 'last.Angered', 'thefts', 'farmers', 'band', 'together', 'eliminate', 'pest', 'problem', 'Eventually', 'entire', 'family', 'animals', 'forest', 'get', 'roped', 'situation', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'selfishness', 'escalating', 'war', 'brought', 'about', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'determined', 'kill', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'costs.Despite', 'PG', 'rating', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'suitable', 'most', 'kids', 'due', 'slow', 'pacing', 'Wes', 'Anderson-styled', 'melancholy', 'trademark', 'script', 'feels', 'meant', 'adults', 'rather', 'children', 'origin', 'story', 'being', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'novel', 'George', 'Clooney', 'most', 'lines', 'deadpan', 'are', 'few', 'quick', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'driven', 'mostly', 'dialog', 'exploration', 'family', 'dynamics', 'husband-wife', 'father-son', 'son-nephew', 'High-school', 'aged', 'audiences', 'may', 'be', 'fine', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'under-13', 'crowd', 'not', 'very', 'kid-friendly', 'stuff', 'may', 'bore', 'younger', 'viewers.But', 'adults', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'get', 'amazing', 'soundtrack', 'too', '4.5/5', 'stars']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

And maybe add, ""Click click.""  One hell of a trademark.And it's one hell of a movie as well.  Supposedly, this film was adapted from a children's book, a book that I've never read, and a book that I probably will never read.  It's surely not the case that I don't like the story.  Far from it.  But it seems that this film targets more of an adult audience to me (where the book supposedly targeted children) since most of the humor surely couldn't be understood by anyone under twelve.  And I would guess that many adults won't get most of the humor either.This is surely one of the most sophisticated animated films that you will ever see, and one of the funniest, and one of the cleverest.  I've seen it twice now, and I think that I actually liked it more the second time than the first, which is unusual.  But not as unusual as this film.  You have complete anthropomorphism going on here, which is surely not unusual.  But even more than that, you have humans taking on animal characteristics too (note the humans' decision making being driven by base emotions where Mr. Fox always tries to at least stay level headed) and therefore you will most likely root for the animals here over the humans.  I surely did.Films like ""Shrek"" -- at least the first in the series, as it in particular started going off the rails during the sequels (whenever babies are brought into a story, a franchise ""jumps the shark;"" just ask the cast members of ""Friends"" if you don't believe me) -- are really good.  But this one kicks it up a notch, and it makes you realize that those films were written for the masses.  If you wanted to nitpick a bit, you could say that this film was not directed at the masses.  But I would say that that's a good thing.But perhaps the only real weakness in this film, a weakness that Mr. Fox admits himself (and I'm paraphrasing a bit):  ""My biggest weakness is wanting to be special, wanting to be better than everyone else.  It gets me in trouble.""  But I would respond, ""No reason to apologize, Mr. Fox.  When you're really good you never need to say that you're sorry.""

The film comes off weird, but a couple minutes in, you'll be loving the whole vibe. The oddness of the characters, the animation, and the music all gives it a tone that you think would be off putting but is one of the most refreshing takes on a movie in a while.Mr. Fox (Clooney) promises his lovely wife (Streep)that he will stop stealing, in light of getting caught red handed. George Clooney, Meryl Streep and small parts from Anderson usual's, Murray and Wilson make up the extraordinary cast. The characters are unique and develop throughout the film. Mr. Fox is a animal trying to find freedom from his boring, monotonous day, and Badger is a hot-headed lawyer. The writing is top notch, and never gets boring, and the music is perfect for the movie.

It is not a cartoon but it is not a regular movie, and I just didn't get it.  The movie is also based on a book by Roald Dahl called Fantastic Mr. Fox which I unfortunately hadn't read before.  This movie is adorable and I cannot believe it held my 3 year old and 20 month old's attention for the whole movie!  I know they didn't really get what was going on, but they were fascinated by it, as was I.  The movie was about Mr. Fox who lives a dangerous life as a chicken stealer, then quits when he finds out he is going to be a dad.  After a few years, he realizes he is missing something and decides to do a few 'jobs' stealing from the meanest farmers in the county.  The movie has some great lessons though like:  It is okay to be different, Don't lie, and Work together.  I found myself laughing throughout this movie, and I actually won't mind when my boys want to watch it again!  I am always going to pick up the book!I would recommend this movie to all ages.  It is a cute tale and if you loved the book by Roald Dahl, then you have to check it out.  I also really liked the voices, for example, George Clooney is Mr. Fox and he pretty much talks the whole movie.  I also loved the relationship between his son and nephew - one an outside and the other one popular and good at everything.

FOXSTARRING: The Voices of: George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Eric Chase Anderson, Wallace Wolodarsky, Wes Anderson, Michael Gambon, Helen McCrory, Adrien Brody and Willem DafoeWRITTEN BY: Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach; based on the novel by Roald DahlDIRECTED BY: Wes AndersonRated: PGGenre: Animation / ComedyRelease Date: 25 November 2009Up was a really good movie, but the Oscar for best animated film belonged to Fantastic Mr. Fox. It should have also relieved Up for its slot in the top 10 best films of the year. I've never seen anything like it. The animation was spectacular as was the film in its entirety. It's smart, hilarious and brilliantly acted by everyone; George Clooney in particular. It's like Ocean's Eleven, but with animals, you see.I have never read the famous children's book by Roald Dahl, but am dying to, having seen the film twice now. Screenwriter and director Wes Anderson's work may just be among the most unique in Hollywood, and this is my favorite of his films, hands down. Any guy, who puts Owen Wilson in virtually every film, is OK in my book.Fantastic Mr. Fox is shot in stop animation and it's the best film I've ever seen in this style. From the sets, to the characters, to the outfits they are wearing; everything was given the minutest detail and it really shows itself off throughout the film. It may be PG, and it may be based on a children's book, and it may be animated, but Fantastic Mr. Fox is every bit as much for adults as it is for kids, if not more so. The characters at times use profanity, but rather than say the actual swear words out loud, they are cleverly replaced with the word, `cuss.' At one point in the film one of them says, ""Are you cussing with me?""George Clooney stars as the voice of Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep voices his wife, Mrs. Fox. Their son Ash is voiced by the hilarious Jason Schwartzman and all three of them are phenomenal. Bill Murray is in here too as a badger who is an attorney and of course you can catch Owen Wilson as Ash's coach, Skip.Mr. Fox has retired from his thrill of stealing chickens, as he made a promise to do so to Mrs. Fox, at the news that she was pregnant. Several years later however, he has once again taken an interest in the excitement of stealing chickens, and may hold some slight resentment to his son Ash, for being the reason he had to give up on his passion.This is shown primarily by the way Mr. Fox does little to encourage Ash, who is short for his age and considered to be somewhat of an outcast. He's `different' - whatever that word means in today's society.Things get worse for poor little Ash, when the prized child of the family, his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson), comes to stay with them. Mr. Fox seems to be completely in the dark to the fact that he favors Kristofferson in his physical abilities in sporting activities, to those of his son Ash.Ash definitely notices this, and he notices when the girl at school he has a crush on, takes a liking to Kristofferson. One of my favorite moments in the film is where Ash gives Kristofferson a guilt trip about not wanting to sleep on the floor of his room by saying, ""Oh you going to put about it? Because I've had it up to here with the sad house guest routine!"" Schwartzman's delivery is priceless.Mr. Fox is enthralled with Kristofferson's athletic agility. When he has mastered up the perfect plan to get himself back into the game of chicken stealing, he brings his nephew along. Mr. Fox will strategically break into the chicken factories of three notorious rich men in town. The fact that his plan may backfire, never crosses his mind.There is some suspense to be had, especially when he learns that one of them is being guarded by one of Mr. Fox's long forgotten enemies; Rat, played by Willem Dafoe. Great scenes here as well folks. Before Mr. Fox knows it, his entire family is in danger because of his lying and selfishness and it's up to him to save everyone, and hopefully learn a lesson or two in the process.The film is so much, you simply can't miss it. There are some moments that may scare younger kids, as at times the animals are, well - animalistic, in nature. Especially the way they eat. In addition to this, they look very real, and there are several close-ups of their furry faces that will leave you breathless.Fantastic Mr. Fox is littered with laughs throughout - the kind that escape unexpectedly and boisterously. It's fun for everyone and kids will be entertained and pick up on the lessons the film feeds them: stealing is wrong, lying is wrong and family is what matters most.

The Fox family is totally spot on as far the characterization goes for this type of film.That people give this one star show, inextricably, the laughably sincere nature and awful taste of many Amazon reviewers. In one such review we find the critique that one cannot further 'suspend their disbelief' because of the increasingly crazy nature of a film.... about anthropomorphic foxes and rodents. Ummmm. Yeah.

He wanted to make Fantastic Mr. Fox because it was an important book from his childhood.

Also included are puppet tests and early animation that gives us a good idea of what the characters were to look and act like. There is a collection of photographs of houses and furniture for the art department to reference in the film. There is a fascinating look at various puppets being created in the studio. There is a time-lapse photography featurette documenting how scenes are painstakingly animated over days. Also included is a look at composer Alexandre Desplat working on the score.

Desplat has done it again with a soundtrack that kicks just right...yet he doesn't interfere with the terrific songs such as selections from Brian Wilson's ""Heroes and Villains"".2. The vocal talent here is unmatched in animated experience. George Clooney pitted against Sir Michael Gambon? Bill Murray sparring with Jason Schwartzman and Wes Anderson (who voiced as well as directed)...superb! Even the inimitable Brian Cox makes an absolutely side-splitting cameo.3.

Saying which, I think the substitution of the word ""cuss"" where all cuss words would normally be used is one of the most brilliant things I've ever heard.5.

There's also characters who drink and smoke which is inappropriate for childrens' viewing.This movie also runs too long.  Just when I thought the movie would end, it kept going and going.  I don't see little kids being able to wait this movie out.So it's really adults who'll get a kick out of this movie, and not just the content, but the dry, sarcastic humor as well.  I found Mr. Fox amusing, but my favorite character was Mr. Fox's bitter son.  It was also amusing watching the world from an animal's point of view and all the clever animal humor mixed in.I was a little confused by the message, though.  Were these characters supposed to embrace their wild side or suppress it?Although that wasn't clear to me, overall, I found this witty and clever movie fun to watch.",4,Fun for adults,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,1103,"['When', 'think', 'stop-motion', 'films', 'think', 'movies', 'Rudolph', 'Red-nose', 'Reindeer', 'are', 'geared', 'towards', 'little', 'children', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'geared', 'more', 'towards', 'adults', 'Young', 'children', 'might', 'find', 'too', 'violent', 'chickens', 'who', 'get', 'killed', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'tail', 'cut', 'off', 'see', 'blood', 'also', 'characters', 'who', 'drink', 'smoke', 'inappropriate', 'childrens', 'viewing.This', 'movie', 'also', 'too', 'long', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'end', 'kept', 'going', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'little', 'kids', 'being', 'able', 'wait', 'movie', 'really', 'adults', 'who', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'content', 'dry', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'found', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'amusing', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'bitter', 'son', 'was', 'also', 'amusing', 'watching', 'world', 'animal', 'point', 'view', 'clever', 'animal', 'humor', 'mixed', 'in.I', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'message', 'though', 'Were', 'characters', 'supposed', 'embrace', 'wild', 'side', 'suppress', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'overall', 'found', 'witty', 'clever', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

But recently, I didn't have much on my plate to rent, so I decided to give this a try.  Does it live up to its hype, at least for me?  Well, not really, but it was still a pretty good film.The stop motion is interesting; they went for a jerkier feel, presumably to give it a stylistic flair that's different from other famous stop motion movies such as Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (which is beautiful, by the way).  I didn't mind the animation once I got used to it.  It does give the film some charm.My main problem with this film is that other reviewers seemed to find it hilariously funny, but I just didn't laugh once.  I didn't even chuckle.  This film felt more like a study of familial interpersonal relationships than a comedy, and I guess it succeeded in that.  I felt like it was thought-provoking on many levels, one of them being the recognition of patterns of behavior that should be familiar to anyone who had even a mildly dysfunctional family.  On another level you could interpret the film's animal cast as a metaphor for the human condition.  When Mr. Fox got on his soap box (literally) at the end of the movie and made his little speech about appreciating what they had despite the fact that everything seems fake (""these apples look fake, but at least they have stars on them""), it made me think about our own society in that we've progressed technologically far past what our species is actually adapted for.  So yes, much of the way we live is fake, but it's still got its benefits and perks.  I liked how the animals' seemingly civilized behavior (wearing clothing, reading newspapers) was contrasted with their animalistic side (devouring food, growling at each other); once again, I saw the parallels in humanity - perhaps, we too, are just wild animals.One last thing - at first, I found it difficult to like Mr. Fox.  He's just so self-centered that it can be difficult to relate to him.  However, by the end of the film, I warmed up to him.  He's clearly a flawed protagonist, but I have a soft spot for flawed protagonists, and he does redeem himself.  At the end of the day, he is awfully charming.So, I do recommend this film, but perhaps not as a comedy nor even a family film since many of the themes are very adult.  Definitely rent this first before you buy, since you may or may not like it.  Overall, though, I liked it.",4,"Entertaining and thought provoking, but not necessarily funny...",1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,2439,"['had', 'heard', 'much', 'hype', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'recently', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'plate', 'rent', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'least', 'Well', 'not', 'really', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'film.The', 'stop', 'motion', 'interesting', 'went', 'jerkier', 'feel', 'presumably', 'give', 'stylistic', 'flair', 'different', 'other', 'famous', 'stop', 'motion', 'movies', 'such', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'beautiful', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'animation', 'once', 'got', 'used', 'give', 'film', 'charm.My', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'other', 'reviewers', 'seemed', 'find', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'chuckle', 'film', 'felt', 'more', 'study', 'familial', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'comedy', 'guess', 'succeeded', 'felt', 'was', 'thought-provoking', 'many', 'levels', 'one', 'being', 'recognition', 'patterns', 'behavior', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'even', 'mildly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'level', 'could', 'interpret', 'film', 'animal', 'cast', 'metaphor', 'human', 'condition', 'When', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'got', 'soap', 'box', 'literally', 'end', 'movie', 'made', 'little', 'speech', 'appreciating', 'what', 'had', 'fact', 'everything', 'fake', 'apples', 'look', 'fake', 'least', 'have', 'stars', 'made', 'think', 'own', 'society', ""'ve"", 'progressed', 'technologically', 'far', 'past', 'what', 'species', 'actually', 'adapted', 'So', 'yes', 'much', 'way', 'live', 'fake', 'still', 'got', 'benefits', 'perks', 'liked', 'how', 'animals', 'seemingly', 'civilized', 'behavior', 'wearing', 'clothing', 'reading', 'newspapers', 'was', 'contrasted', 'animalistic', 'side', 'devouring', 'food', 'growling', 'other', 'once', 'again', 'saw', 'parallels', 'humanity', 'perhaps', 'too', 'are', 'just', 'wild', 'animals.One', 'last', 'thing', 'first', 'found', 'difficult', 'like', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'just', 'so', 'self-centered', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'relate', 'However', 'end', 'film', 'warmed', 'up', 'clearly', 'flawed', 'protagonist', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'flawed', 'protagonists', 'redeem', 'end', 'day', 'awfully', 'charming.So', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'perhaps', 'not', 'comedy', 'even', 'family', 'film', 'many', 'themes', 'are', 'very', 'adult', 'Definitely', 'rent', 'first', 'buy', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'Overall', 'liked']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

How nice.The entire score is as unconventional as the film -- dominated by banjo and rhythm tracks to give it an ""independent film"" texture rather than the now-obligatory John Williams-type score (not that I don't love those scores too, this is just a fresh approach and avoids the modern factory film feel).Even the titles are clever, all in keeping not only with a singular director's vision, but also very much in the Roald Dahl style. This particular book, by the way, is perhaps one of the most challenging to bring to film since it is one of the few Dahl stories without magical fantasy elements.I think the overall takeaway, and the thread through all the other comments on this topic is -- intelligence.

It's wonderful that stop motion is getting some new life with the likes of Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline, Corpse Bride and now this gem Fantastic Mr. Fox. I was not familiar with the Dahl book or story so I was going into this one blind. I fell in love with the characters, story, sets, voices and animation immediately. The majority of the movie's humor and dialogue (there's a good deal of desert dry chatter in this film) will fly right over the heads of most children and even some adults to be certain. The humor is dry, full of wit and adult driven. I loved it!Video quality on this Blu Ray is strong, nearly perfect. Autumn colors are abundant and the texture of the character's wardrobe and fur is nothing short of amazing. These details really bring this film to life. The audio quality is good; the center channel gets the biggest work out by far on this DTS HD MA lossless track. I was a tad disappointed that the surround speakers and sub-woofer did not get more activity. This audio track was a bit subdued for such a lively movie. Make no mistake though, the dialogue is handled extremely well and the track sounds very solid. Just just don't expect a wiz bang audio excursion track like Up, Wall-E or Coraline.The vocal casting and acting in this animated feature are superb; I don't think I have ever heard better in any animated film.

Mr. Fox decides though to move his family into a new place, while at the same time planning heists on the three local major farms with his new landlord possum, Kylie. After somewhat successfully strealing from them, the ex-Nazi owner of the cider ranch that Fox stole from plans to go WWII on his ass by attacking his new home. After he and the other two farmers run them out, the Fox family heads for the sewers along with the rest of most of the forest critters. The animals then dig under the farms and totally wipe out their stock. The farmers retaliate by flooding them out into the sewers, and eventually capture Kristofferson thinking that he's Ash. Fox then leads a rescue mission to get Kristofferson back with Ash and Kylie. The Fox family then make a new home underneath a supermarket which happens to be owned by all the farmers.This movie mixed stop-motion animation with computer effects pretty well, especially since it was done by Henry Selick, whose wizardry includes his own movie Coraline, and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Selick also worked on the animation for Anderson's The Life Aquatic. I was very suprised with the detail given to the animals' fur and expressions. There are times when the characters seem slightly out of place, like the 4ft. rat that worked for the farmers. Plus, they never explain why the regular forest animals wear clothes and can talk, while the other animals like bloodhounds and wolves are just regular animals. I was suprised though at how much good criticism this film got, especially from critics who aren't normally fans of animation. I thought it was in all a good movie overall, although not as funny as it could have been at times. Despite its charm, its not totally a movie for the entire family, but is truly one for the ages, and I have to say I'm impressed with its look at old fashion style for a modern day production",4,Pure Furry Fun!,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,2601,"['Roald', 'Dahl', 'left', 'long', 'legacy', 'children', 'literature', 'Many', 'works', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'movies', 'including', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory/Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Witches', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'Revered', 'director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'went', 'extra', 'step', 'further', 'making', 'film', 'first', 'fully-animated', 'adaptation', 'one', 'Dahl', 'books.Set', 'British', 'countryside', 'even', 'most', 'cast', 'American', 'accents', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'stealing', 'farmers', 'start', 'up', 'family', 'Mrs.', 'Fox', 'A', 'few', 'fox', 'years', 'son', 'Ash', 'going', 'akward', 'teenage', 'phase', 'resenting', 'having', 'cousin', 'Kristofferson', 'moving', 'territory', 'school', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'move', 'family', 'new', 'place', 'same', 'time', 'planning', 'heists', 'three', 'local', 'major', 'farms', 'new', 'landlord', 'possum', 'Kylie', 'somewhat', 'successfully', 'strealing', 'ex-Nazi', 'owner', 'cider', 'ranch', 'Fox', 'stole', 'plans', 'go', 'WWII', 'ass', 'attacking', 'new', 'home', 'other', 'two', 'farmers', 'run', 'out', 'Fox', 'family', 'heads', 'sewers', 'rest', 'most', 'forest', 'critters', 'animals', 'then', 'dig', 'farms', 'totally', 'wipe', 'out', 'stock', 'farmers', 'retaliate', 'flooding', 'out', 'sewers', 'eventually', 'capture', 'Kristofferson', 'thinking', 'Ash', 'Fox', 'then', 'rescue', 'mission', 'get', 'Kristofferson', 'back', 'Ash', 'Kylie', 'Fox', 'family', 'then', 'make', 'new', 'home', 'underneath', 'supermarket', 'be', 'owned', 'farmers.This', 'movie', 'mixed', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'computer', 'effects', 'pretty', 'well', 'especially', 'was', 'done', 'Henry', 'Selick', 'wizardry', 'own', 'movie', 'Coraline', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'Selick', 'also', 'worked', 'animation', 'Anderson', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'was', 'very', 'suprised', 'detail', 'given', 'animals', 'fur', 'expressions', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'characters', 'seem', 'slightly', 'place', '4ft', 'rat', 'worked', 'farmers', 'never', 'explain', 'why', 'regular', 'forest', 'animals', 'wear', 'clothes', 'can', 'talk', 'other', 'animals', 'bloodhounds', 'wolves', 'are', 'just', 'regular', 'animals', 'was', 'suprised', 'though', 'how', 'much', 'good', 'criticism', 'film', 'got', 'especially', 'critics', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'normally', 'fans', 'animation', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'overall', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'times', 'charm', 'not', 'totally', 'movie', 'entire', 'family', 'truly', 'one', 'ages', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'look', 'old', 'fashion', 'style', 'modern', 'day', 'production']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

It is the inimitable, inspiring and slightly intimidating Fantastic Mr. Fox.(Very mild spoilers)The Fantastic Mr. Fox is just that:  FANTASTIC.  This is a classic gem of stop motion animation that should be in every father's movie collection.  The story may be a child's ( written by Roald Dahl ) but the humor is definitely adult.The voice talent in this film is top notch.  George Clooney somehow makes Mr. Fox endearing even though he's kind of a jerk.  MERYL STREEP voices Mrs. Fox; who dreams she can reform the outlaw fox and steer him into a more respectable - I.e. safer - vocation.  Bill Murray voices Fox's best friend Badger, who works at the prestigious law firm of Badger, Beaver and Beaver.It all starts when Fox has his midlife crisis at age seven (forty two in fox years) and becomes discontent with his lot.  Keenly aware that his own father died at only seven and a half, Mr. Fox decides that he is tired of living in a hole.  He moves his family to a pricey tree that overlooks the farms of the three meanest farmers in England.  Immortalized in a chilling little ditty sung by the local Human children, Borgus, Boggs and Bean are old nemesis's of Mr. Fox.  The three farmers and the reformed chicken thief/cider poacher Mr. Fox are set on a collision course when Fox spies an ad for a sale on bandit hats in the local paper.I loved this film at the cinema and never forgot it.  Now that it is available on Blu-Ray I've watched it four additional times.  What gives this film legs, what makes it an animation classic is that you uncover some new detail in every scene whenever you watch it.  Who can resist Willem Dafoe as Bean's Psychotic Security Rat; a Ciderholic who carries a switchblade and moves like a Shark from Westside Story?  Brian Cox, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson help round out the cast.  Michael Gambon ( Albus Dumbledor ) is classic as a farmer &#34;skinny as a pencil, as smart as a whip and possibly the scariest man currently living.&#34;This is a film filled with witty dialogue that you will come to love.Some of my favorites include:  &#8226;Well, anyway... It's not half as bad as double pneumonia, right?  I mean, HIS dad has got one foot in the grave and three feet on a banana peel!&#8226; and then there is the non sequitur:  &#8226;That's just weak songwriting.  You wrote a bad song Petey!&#8226; and my favorite, the frantic Mr. Fox:  of: &#8226;Oh no!  Where did you get that Nutmeg Ginger Apple Snap?  And why are you wearing that fake bandit hat?!?&#8226;Believe it or not, you cannot help but love it when these incongruent gems of dialogue pop up.  You'll see.

1231732,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B001QOGYBI,Jordan David,"[0, 0]","Wes Anderson's wonderfully offbeat, awkward, and deceptively genius humor comes to full form here, in a film directed with a younger audience in mind.  Believe me when I say that I didn't see it coming, either, but exceptionally eccentric director may have found his calling card with Mr. Fox, which is a witty, creative, and razor-sharp adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic short story.Although envisioned in a fascinating stop-motion form that is both complex and simple, Anderson's story is told with depth and human emotion, not to mention with a humor that is immediately recognizable by longtime Anderson followers.  However, what makes Fox so much more than the sum of its parts is the startlingly cohesive nature of Anderson's vision and the freedoms of the animation that come together with such grace.  They were simply made for one another, even more so than Burton and Depp.With so much charm, it's easy to overlook the all-star cast, but it took the talents of Schwartzman, Streep, Clooney, Defoe, Murray, Wilson, Blanchett, among many others, to match Anderson's pitch-perfect comedic timing.  Every character is wonderful, forming to their character perfectly, to an extent where you forget the actors themselves and see each little animal for what they are:  Unusual, deceiving, and ultimately hilarious and eerily human individuals.There's really nothing to discourage you from seeing this film; it's hilarious, clever, impeccably paced, accompanied by a good message, and one of those few films that stands up well to multiple viewings.  The only real question mark is where Anderson draws the line regarding mature humor and immature entertainment; the two get mixed in the process, and the results are mixed for the toddler audience - in layman's terms, don't take your children to a film expecting golden age Disney animation.That said, for everyone else, Fantastic Fox is a huge breathe of fresh air, even in the midst of such films as Pixar's masterpiece, UP.

1231733,AO80ZID761BZH,B001QOGYBI,Joseph_,"[1, 9]","I saw the previews for this movie, but like most nowadays I missed any chance at going to see it in the theater, so I had to do with renting it and watching it at my home.The thing that attracted me most to the movie was the animation and the stars. George's deep, even voice against Meryl's beautiful, low tones seemed like an interesting match for a movie like this, and the animation- stop-motion- has become quite popular with movie-makers. But ironically, the thing that made the film most famous- its animation- is the reason I couldn't give it five stars.You know the English- they've got their own breed of quirky, fun humor that I fully enjoy. This movie certainly feels different somehow, perhaps the lack of color and adult-feel to the story has to do with it. It's a quiet, cute movie, and yet it feels weird. I know the fans will hate me for that, too.And the animation is... well, it contributes to the odd sensation of the film. It's artistic and interesting to observe, but stiff and jerky. The characters have a lack of movement, and it feels ridiculous- like the scenes where they all dig into the ground? It looks really bizarre, not to mention the scene they get flushed away by cider. So the animation, I think, takes away from the charming feel of this little movie. Had they done it in CG, it wouldn't have been so famous (I mean, there's so many CG movies, I guess I understand why they chose to do stop-animation to be different), but it would have helped the story.But my ranting done, it's a good movie, and worth a watch. It's got bits of humor sprinkled here and there that made me laugh, and Mr. Fox's son reminded me a lot of a friend of mine, which made his character all the more enjoyable. Certainly not for kids... with an amount of violence that I'm guessing strict parents would hate their babies to watch. But adults and teenagers will most likely enjoy. I found it a little boring at parts, but it smoothed over with a pretty good message and some good speeches from good old Meryl and George. Some other smaller parts are snagged by actors that'll make you be like, ""Whoa- he's in here, too?"" The deep, rumbling voice of Michael Gambon as one of the deranged, scary farmers made me chuckle- because everyone likes a reminder of our old wizard, Dumbledore.So a good idea, a cute plot, but bizarre.

1231734,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001QOGYBI,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","Wes Anderson's sixth directorial feature and first animated film is an adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved children's book Fantastic Mr. Fox. With a script co-written with Noah Baumbach, Anderson's film stays close to the source material (though I can't speak on that completely having never read the source material), but his quirky, minimalist style is still identifiable.The cast of voice actors, including several Anderson regulars, is top notch. George Clooney is Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep is Mrs. Fox, Jason Schwartzman is their alienated son Ash, Eric Anderson is the impressive nephew Kristofferson, Bill Murray is Mr. Fox's lawyer Badger, and Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Adrien Brody round out the rest of the voice cast. No actor is miscast in their voice roles and Clooney, Dafoe, and Schwartzman give particularly inspired performances.The film's story is wonderful; both funny, entertaining, and having a strong moral/ethical lesson but its Anderson's direction and various technical aspects that make Fantastic Mr. Fox as fantastic as it is. It's rare for one to mention costume design when referring to an animated film, but the costume design here is wonderful. As many have said before me, it should have received an Oscar nomination and only didn't due to rules about animated features. The characters and sets are intricately designed, showcasing Anderson's attention to detail. It's a painstaking process to make a stop-motion feature and its clear watching the film that the filmmakers wanted to make sure that they were putting their time to great use. While there are plenty of stop-motion movies out there, none look the way this one does which makes it even more fascinating to watch. The animation should fascinate both adults and children with its detail and personality. The soundtrack also contributes to the overall tone of the film with its mix of classic rock and folk music.More than anything, this film has heart, personality, and charm. It's intelligently written and very quotable, as well as very funny. There is some adult humor, but it's not slyly inserted to amuse parents. It's well-written, clever adult humor that is actually funny and relevant to the film. With that said, it will appeal to both adults and children for different reasons and it doesn't insult the intelligence of either demographic. In a display of very clever writing, Anderson has the characters say ""cuss"" in place of any cuss word, which is a rather brilliant touch. Finally, Ash, the teenaged fox desperately vying for his father's attention is actually more human than many live-action characters that hit the screen. Much of this comes from Schwartzman's voice performance, but it's in the writing too. In both personality and expression, I found these stop-motion creations are more expressive and emotional (especially in the eyes) than the majority of motion-capture films that have been released (particularly those by Robert Zemeckis). Even with Anderson's style, I think Roald Dahl would have been very pleased with this film.This is the best animated film of 2009. Having seen it twice now, I can attest that it's also one of the top ten best films of 2009 and it's sad that many ignore its inventiveness and charm. Wes Anderson and co. have created something very special here.GRADE: A",5,The Best Animated Film of 2009,1269648000,"03 27, 2010",2010,3325,"['Wes', 'Anderson', 'sixth', 'directorial', 'feature', 'first', 'animated', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'beloved', 'children', 'book', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'script', 'co-written', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'Anderson', 'film', 'close', 'source', 'material', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'completely', 'having', 'never', 'read', 'source', 'material', 'quirky', 'minimalist', 'style', 'still', 'identifiable.The', 'cast', 'voice', 'actors', 'including', 'several', 'Anderson', 'regulars', 'top', 'notch', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Mrs.', 'Fox', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'alienated', 'son', 'Ash', 'Eric', 'Anderson', 'impressive', 'nephew', 'Kristofferson', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'lawyer', 'Badger', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'round', 'out', 'rest', 'voice', 'cast', 'actor', 'miscast', 'voice', 'roles', 'Clooney', 'Dafoe', 'Schwartzman', 'give', 'particularly', 'inspired', 'performances.The', 'film', 'story', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'having', 'strong', 'moral/ethical', 'lesson', 'Anderson', 'direction', 'various', 'technical', 'aspects', 'make', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'as', 'fantastic', 'rare', 'one', 'mention', 'costume', 'design', 'when', 'referring', 'animated', 'film', 'costume', 'design', 'here', 'wonderful', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'due', 'rules', 'animated', 'features', 'characters', 'sets', 'are', 'intricately', 'designed', 'showcasing', 'Anderson', 'attention', 'detail', 'painstaking', 'process', 'make', 'stop-motion', 'feature', 'clear', 'watching', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'were', 'putting', 'time', 'great', 'use', 'are', 'plenty', 'stop-motion', 'movies', 'there', 'none', 'look', 'way', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'animation', 'should', 'fascinate', 'adults', 'children', 'detail', 'personality', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'mix', 'classic', 'rock', 'folk', 'music.More', 'anything', 'film', 'heart', 'personality', 'charm', 'intelligently', 'written', 'very', 'quotable', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'funny', 'adult', 'humor', 'not', 'slyly', 'inserted', 'amuse', 'parents', 'well-written', 'clever', 'adult', 'humor', 'actually', 'funny', 'relevant', 'film', 'said', 'will', 'appeal', 'adults', 'children', 'different', 'reasons', ""n't"", 'insult', 'intelligence', 'demographic', 'display', 'very', 'clever', 'writing', 'Anderson', 'characters', 'say', 'cuss', 'place', 'cuss', 'word', 'rather', 'brilliant', 'touch', 'Finally', 'Ash', 'teenaged', 'fox', 'desperately', 'vying', 'father', 'attention', 'actually', 'more', 'human', 'many', 'live-action', 'characters', 'hit', 'screen', 'Much', 'Schwartzman', 'voice', 'performance', 'writing', 'too', 'personality', 'expression', 'found', 'stop-motion', 'creations', 'are', 'more', 'expressive', 'emotional', 'especially', 'eyes', 'majority', 'motion-capture', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'particularly', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Even', 'Anderson', 'style', 'think', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'pleased', 'film.This', 'best', 'animated', 'film', '2009', 'Having', 'seen', 'twice', 'now', 'can', 'attest', 'also', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'best', 'films', '2009', 'sad', 'many', 'ignore', 'inventiveness', 'charm', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'co.', 'have', 'created', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'here.GRADE']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

It proves that you can have a family-friendly movie without dumbing down the content.  This thing is totally kid-safe but it is NOT written for children.  It doesn't simplify matters.  The plot is simple, but the characters are complex.  This movie doesn't condescend, and I found that to be incredibly refreshing.  Another neat thing I noticed is the movie's ""timelessness.""  The stop-motion animation is technically impressive (masterfully done; some of the best I've seen) but it gives a nostalgic, almost antique look to the production.  It's not slick CG-rendered stuff; it looks old.  I think this movie is going to date extremely well, since it does not seem to be strongly tied to the present.  I expect it to be just as good twenty years from now as it is today.  There are no fart jokes, no incongruous pop-culture or current-event references, no contemporary Top 40 singles embedded in the soundtrack.  It's very clean, very self-contained within its own world.  I consider that a plus.The humor is that sort of understated, character-driven style that fans of Wes Anderson will appreciate.  The voices are not typical animation-style performances, but it all works extremely well, making the characters convincing and relatable.  The pacing is fast, but it feels slow because of what the director chooses to spend time on.  Overall a very quirky and surprisingly enjoyable experience.Older adults will enjoy the story and the interaction of the characters.  Very young children will be captivated by the cute talking animals.  However, it's likely that kids 10 - 16 years old will find this movie terribly boring (re the absence of fart jokes and ""cool"" stuff as mentioned above.)  It's unique and extremely smart - maybe too smart to appeal to the demographic that animated films are generally _supposed_ to be for.  Fans of animation as an art form MUST add this to their collections.  I hate to use the phrase ""instant classic"" but I have never seen a film more deserving of that epithet.

It's like puppet show and a painting coming to life in front of you.  Just gorgeous.2. It's not CGI.  I'm getting really weary of CGI movies that are all about gags and CGI tricks and not about the story or the characters.3. Very character driven by today's standards.  I found myself caring for the main characters right from the get-go, which is not something that happens a lot anymore, sadly.  I really believed Mr. and Mrs. Fox were a married couple, and the family dynamic was very familiar and believable.4. Great supporting character critters.  Just a lot of fun with all the different animals and their unique abilities and quirks contributing to the story.5. There was humor, but it didn't come across as trying to be funny all the time.  It's there, and maybe some of it fell flat, but that sort of added to the charm.  Too many of these family CGI type movies try too hard to be funny, and they're not.  Part of humor is that it's unexpected.6.  The soundtrack.  Just plain fun and the minimalist bluegrass sounding stuff just seemed totally appropriate.  I'm going to be buying some Bobby Fuller Four music soon.Oh yeah, Phil Seymour made an excellent rendition of Let Her Dance.  Very much like the Bobby Fuller Four version but about 3 minutes and made more recently with better recording quality.  Check it out if you like this song.Now for the downside:1.  Was this for kids or not?  At the end of the movie I asked my chidren, who've seen quite a few movies, what the point was or what they remembered, and they didn't say much.  They really didn't seem to like it.  I'm wondering if children under 10 or so even get this movie.  Not that my children are the benchmark for all children, but I was surprised at how little they got out of this movie.2.  The use of ""cuss"" where cussing would be was clever.  The kids didn't get what they weren't supposed to get, but I think they crossed the line a bit when they used the term ""cluster cuss"".  That's a variant of a deeply crass term used in a short, useless and throwaway scene that didn't even need to be there, and I feel sad for any parents whose kids ask them to decode that one.Finally, I'm reviewing the movie and not the DVD product.  What if the DVD contains the movie alone and no special features?  Will it have a ""making of"" documentary?  Will there be a commentary track?  Who knows?  Those things make a difference in the value one gets for one's DVD dollar.",4,A slightly flawed furry fun family fantasy.,1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,2536,"['Just', 'saw', 'morning', 'Here', 'what', 'liked.1', 'Beautifully', 'different', 'Just', 'look', 'puppet', 'show', 'painting', 'coming', 'life', 'front', 'Just', 'gorgeous.2', 'not', 'CGI', ""'m"", 'getting', 'really', 'weary', 'CGI', 'movies', 'are', 'gags', 'CGI', 'tricks', 'not', 'story', 'characters.3', 'Very', 'character', 'driven', 'today', 'standards', 'found', 'caring', 'main', 'characters', 'right', 'get-go', 'not', 'something', 'lot', 'anymore', 'sadly', 'really', 'believed', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Fox', 'were', 'married', 'couple', 'family', 'dynamic', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', 'believable.4', 'Great', 'supporting', 'character', 'critters', 'Just', 'lot', 'fun', 'different', 'animals', 'unique', 'abilities', 'quirks', 'contributing', 'story.5', 'was', 'humor', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'time', 'there', 'maybe', 'fell', 'flat', 'sort', 'added', 'charm', 'Too', 'many', 'family', 'CGI', 'type', 'movies', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', ""'re"", 'not', 'Part', 'humor', 'unexpected.6', 'soundtrack', 'Just', 'plain', 'fun', 'minimalist', 'bluegrass', 'sounding', 'stuff', 'just', 'seemed', 'totally', 'appropriate', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'buying', 'Bobby', 'Fuller', 'Four', 'music', 'soon.Oh', 'yeah', 'Phil', 'Seymour', 'made', 'excellent', 'rendition', 'Let', 'Her', 'Dance', 'Very', 'much', 'Bobby', 'Fuller', 'Four', 'version', '3', 'minutes', 'made', 'more', 'recently', 'better', 'recording', 'quality', 'Check', 'out', 'like', 'song.Now', 'downside:1', 'Was', 'kids', 'not', 'end', 'movie', 'asked', 'chidren', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'movies', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'what', 'remembered', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'like', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'children', '10', 'so', 'even', 'get', 'movie', 'Not', 'children', 'are', 'benchmark', 'children', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'little', 'got', 'out', 'movie.2', 'use', 'cuss', 'where', 'cussing', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'clever', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'were', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'get', 'think', 'crossed', 'line', 'bit', 'when', 'used', 'term', 'cluster', 'cuss', 'variant', 'deeply', 'crass', 'term', 'used', 'short', 'useless', 'throwaway', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'be', 'there', 'feel', 'sad', 'parents', 'kids', 'ask', 'decode', 'one.Finally', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'movie', 'not', 'DVD', 'product', 'What', 'DVD', 'movie', 'alone', 'special', 'features', 'Will', 'have', 'making', 'documentary', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'commentary', 'track', 'Who', 'things', 'make', 'difference', 'value', 'one', 'one', 'DVD', 'dollar']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

The stop-motion animation is charming. The voice talent, headed by George Clooney and Meryl Streep, raises the bar for animated films. There is some smart, subtle humor. Box-office figures tell me I'm the only one out there, but I'm just so, so, so sick of 3D computer-generated animation movies bogged down with slapstick/bathroom humor, flying objects and the voices of the same comedians over and over.Unfortunately a couple of things kept me from giving this a higher ranking. I found it disconcerting that the animals had American accents and the humans had English accents. This is obviously an English countryside story so an all-English cast would have worked better for me. The narrative, about a married fox who can't resist returning to crime after years of a respectable career as a journalist, was OK, but I didn't find myself profoundly concerned. Put it this way: If the DVD hadn't played properly, I wouldn't have stomped up to the video store and demanded another disc so I could see the ending.Though animated, I wouldn't call ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" a children's movie. The morality is too ambiguous and the humor too adult. I don't mean that it's particularly obscene or vulgar or morally reprehensible; it's not. It's just that most kids aren't going to appreciate this film.

I tried to get my 4 year old to watch with me but she was uninterested. I think it is because the colors aren't as vivid and the images weren't as quick as the movies kids are used to these days.There were parts I wasn't comfortable with like farmers shouting, ""lets kill kim"" before shooting Mr. Fox's tail off. Also, the scene where Mrs. Fox is bandaging up Mr. Fox's bloody butt, where his tail came off keeps replaying in my head. I could have done without the bloody bandage.

Mr. Fox (George Clooney) has put the dangerous life of a poultry thief behind him and settled down with Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) and a newspaper job. But, never satisfied with the ordinary, Mr. Fox wants to move out of their hole into fancier digs in a treehouse near the Boggis, Bunce, and Bean farms, which prove to be too much temptation. Mr. Fox desperately wants to pull off one last poultry caper. With his hapless opossum handyman Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky) in tow, he aims to rob all three farms -which doesn't sit well with the human farmers, especially Mr. Bean (Michael Gambon), who vows to kill the crafty fox.This is cute enough for children and clever enough to satisfy adults, who will appreciate Mr. Fox's blunt talk. The addition of two young characters, the Fox's son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) and nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson), seems stranger the more I think about it. But the two young oddballs seem to be there to provide an everybody-has-something-to-contribute theme for the children in the audience.

El-Hewie""","[9, 155]","This is the fifth time in 2009 alone that I run into those animation productions that ruined my joy of getting to movie theaters. After the Ice Age, the G-Force, Planet 51, and the Christmas Carol, I was already fed up with all animation movies. This one topped them all with its silliness.Even though animations permitted the producers to invent diverse and effective characters, it exposed the weakness of making elegant characters, motions, or plots. The artists put too much labor in making the faces of the characters appear rich and impressive. Yet, all artistic ingenuity were depleted in making gracefully moving or talking characters.The stiffed and skinny foxes made up a polarized existence that is far inferior to the real world of our beloved animals. Drawing parallels between the conflicts of the survival needs of the farmers and the wolves with those of human conflicts was overreaching. Making the best of enjoying the artistic richness of the movie did not reconcile my discontent with Mr. Fox.Though most movie theaters display brief description of movies, those pamphlets are meticulously designed to escape the attention of busy people. In theaters where the description posters were intentionally hidden, I never took a chance wasting my time and money on nonsensical stuff. Fantastic  Mr. Fox will be my last entrapment in sitting in a theater for a total waste. Beside myself, there was another poor guy sitting in the 120-seat theater.  In the same night, I had to see the Blind Side for the sake of getting over my anger of being stuck with wolves suffering from spinal Billiard sticks.Considering the enormous resources spent on movie display, I doubt that the $20 total per show would pay for the utility usage or the space rental. Even the $4.75 cups of soda in movie theaters are gathering dust from Sunday through Friday.

1231778,AHF97M45JFCB,B001QOGYBI,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","I'm not going to pretend I went into The Fantastic Mr. Fox with expectations in any feasible direction.  I never read the classic book on which this film is based but had vague knowledge of the book's existence as ""one of the other books from the guy who wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach"".Next up comes the realization that the film adaptation was the result of director Wes Anderson's creative vision; a style that, love it or hate it, is undeniably unique.  With past films like Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, about the only common thread I could find was appearances by Bill Murray (and in that regard The Fantastic Mr. Fox continues the tradition).This is the story of one Mr. Fox and the conflict within him between being a responsible family ""man"" and the chicken-stealing wild-ways of his past.Despite making a promise to his wife that the life of thievery is a thing of the past, Mr. Fox decides, as part of his mid-life crisis, that he must try ""just one more raid"" on a trio of intolerant farmers (Boggis, Bunce and Bean).  The sad reality with recovering addiction is that ""just one more"" easily becomes a returning lifestyle and Mr. Fox realizes this only after it's too late.And while the action serves as the catalyst to move the plot along, the core of this tale is satirical family life (personified through animals) of Mr. Fox (George Clooney) wife, Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep), their son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman) and visiting nephewKristofferson Silverfox (Eric Chase Anderson).  It is this dynamic that provides the film's greatest charm by staying close to the moral lessons of the original tome coupled to Anderson's trademark off-brand wit and style.And in keeping with the Wes Anderson brand of style, the visuals, this one forgoes fancy Pixar/ DreamWorks-esque 3D computer animatics for traditional stop-motion technique. And not unlike Aardman's works with Wallace and Gromit or Chicken Run, there is undeniable charm to be found in this method.  Once the viewer adjusts to the intermittent rhythms and the scruffy (almost ultra-realistic) look of the model textures, the wit, beauty and emotional undercurrents contained here are stunningly apparent.The pacing, heck even the themes and satire are undeniably adult oriented however.  Does this mean foul language, sexual themes, or gore? Absolutely not.  Anderson's work is an all-age friendly class act all the way.  However, it's definitely still debatable as to just which age will make the most of the experience here.  The visuals may be strong enough to keep the kiddies involved but it's the sociological and family interrelationships that really define this piece.Entire case studies have been conducted in effort of defining the various themes and underlying issues that author Roald Dahl confronted in his writing and many of these ideals transfer brilliantly into the film: Concepts like our inherent inability to ever fully let go of our youth or the battle between industrialism (represented here by the farmers) and nature.The vocal work is spectacular as is expected from such a deep cast and the Alexandre Desplat soundtrack makes use of an excellently appropriate selection of pop music.In all it's tough to come away from this film without some appreciation of Anderson's ability to combine the classic material with his own sensibilities.  And while his past films may suggest this as a trait that can go either way, rest assured that Fantastic Mr. Fox retains the very best of what Wes Andersen has to offer: Intelligent wit, impeccable timing, and just enough homage to early-filmmaking techniques to be labeled charming.",4,Fantastic is an Appropriate Adjective Here,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,3692,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'pretend', 'went', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'expectations', 'feasible', 'direction', 'never', 'read', 'classic', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'had', 'vague', 'knowledge', 'book', 'existence', 'one', 'other', 'books', 'guy', 'who', 'wrote', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'up', 'realization', 'film', 'adaptation', 'was', 'result', 'director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'creative', 'vision', 'style', 'love', 'hate', 'undeniably', 'unique', 'past', 'films', 'Rushmore', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'only', 'common', 'thread', 'could', 'find', 'was', 'appearances', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'regard', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'tradition', '.This', 'story', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'conflict', 'being', 'responsible', 'family', 'man', 'chicken-stealing', 'wild-ways', 'past.Despite', 'making', 'promise', 'wife', 'life', 'thievery', 'thing', 'past', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'part', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'must', 'try', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'raid', 'trio', 'intolerant', 'farmers', 'Boggis', 'Bunce', 'Bean', 'sad', 'reality', 'recovering', 'addiction', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'easily', 'returning', 'lifestyle', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'only', 'too', 'late.And', 'action', 'catalyst', 'move', 'plot', 'core', 'tale', 'satirical', 'family', 'life', 'personified', 'animals', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'George', 'Clooney', 'wife', 'Mrs.', 'Fox', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'son', 'Ash', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'visiting', 'nephewKristofferson', 'Silverfox', 'Eric', 'Chase', 'Anderson', 'dynamic', 'film', 'greatest', 'charm', 'staying', 'close', 'moral', 'lessons', 'original', 'tome', 'coupled', 'Anderson', 'trademark', 'off-brand', 'wit', 'style.And', 'keeping', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'brand', 'style', 'visuals', 'one', 'fancy', 'Pixar/', 'DreamWorks-esque', '3D', 'computer', 'animatics', 'traditional', 'stop-motion', 'technique', 'not', 'Aardman', 'works', 'Wallace', 'Gromit', 'Chicken', 'Run', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'be', 'found', 'method', 'viewer', 'intermittent', 'rhythms', 'scruffy', 'almost', 'ultra-realistic', 'look', 'model', 'textures', 'wit', 'beauty', 'emotional', 'undercurrents', 'contained', 'here', 'are', 'stunningly', 'apparent.The', 'pacing', 'heck', 'even', 'themes', 'satire', 'are', 'undeniably', 'adult', 'oriented', 'however', 'mean', 'foul', 'language', 'sexual', 'themes', 'gore', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'Anderson', 'work', 'all-age', 'friendly', 'class', 'act', 'way', 'However', 'definitely', 'still', 'debatable', 'just', 'age', 'will', 'make', 'most', 'experience', 'here', 'visuals', 'may', 'be', 'strong', 'enough', 'keep', 'kiddies', 'involved', 'sociological', 'family', 'interrelationships', 'really', 'define', 'piece.Entire', 'case', 'studies', 'have', 'been', 'conducted', 'effort', 'defining', 'various', 'themes', 'underlying', 'issues', 'author', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'confronted', 'writing', 'many', 'ideals', 'transfer', 'brilliantly', 'film', 'Concepts', 'inherent', 'inability', 'ever', 'fully', 'let', 'go', 'youth', 'battle', 'industrialism', 'represented', 'here', 'farmers', 'nature.The', 'vocal', 'work', 'spectacular', 'expected', 'such', 'deep', 'cast', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'soundtrack', 'use', 'excellently', 'appropriate', 'selection', 'pop', 'music.In', 'tough', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'appreciation', 'Anderson', 'ability', 'combine', 'classic', 'material', 'own', 'sensibilities', 'past', 'films', 'may', 'suggest', 'trait', 'can', 'go', 'way', 'rest', 'assured', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'very', 'best', 'what', 'Wes', 'Andersen', 'offer', 'Intelligent', 'wit', 'impeccable', 'timing', 'just', 'enough', 'homage', 'early-filmmaking', 'techniques', 'be', 'labeled', 'charming']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

Writing a newspaper is simply not in Mr. Fox's true nature.  He does possess one skill very much in his nature, but he has promised his wife to never steal chickens, geese, turkeys, or squab (whatever they are) ever again.  Had Mr. Fox simply listened to his lawyer, voiced by none other than Bill Murray, then he would have avoided a number of irresistible temptations to his animal nature.  Unfortunately for his family, Mr. Fox cannot stand the undignified feeling of living in a hole...Such are the idiosynchracies of writing a summary of almost anything Wes Anderson writes and directs.  His unique approach to developing characters and putting witty and nuanced dialogue in their mouths often overwhelms a plot as simple and straight-forward as this, but these are exactly the strengths in which fans of Wes Anderson revel.  And his smartly quirky take on family dynamics is alive and well here just as it wasThe Royal Tenenbaums,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, andThe Darjeeling Limited.  I genuinely believe that with ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" Wes Anderson elevates the family film genre with a story that distinctly character-driven.It would be criminal to overlook all the attention to detail invested in the design, crafting, movement, and even the wardrobe of the physical puppets.  Like many, I have grown increasingly weary of computer-generated images and animation.  That was the main reasonTeam America: World Policewas so refreshing to see; real and tangible objects responding to natural lighting.  Such is the appeal here.Wes Anderson's films tend to appeal to those, like myself, who really want to see something different.

Charming is an excellent word for the film, which has all the lyrical quirkiness we've come to expect of Anderson and his films, whether it be Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Aquatic Life, or his latest effort, Moonrise Kingdom.Besides its quick pace and wit -- and the feeling that it's packed with about 3 times the plot of many live-action films today -- it also has a great voice cast in George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon, not to mention some talented unknowns. The writing is funny, insightful, and clever, and again moves at a breezy clip, just like the movie.The style of stop-motion animation is another high point. Its feel and costuming seems to recall stop-motion techniques from films back in the 1940s and '50s, a kind of retro look that you might get from some of the haunting short animated films of that age, whether it be from artist behind the iron curtain or from the imagination of George Pal (later the creator of blockbuster films like Destination Moon, War of the Worlds, and The Time Machine).Either way, this is a film you can watch with the entire family and come away enthralled.",5,Wes Anderson does it again,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,1286,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'movie', 'anything', 'shall', 'definitely', 'be', 'picking', 'up', 'copy', 'point', 'future', 'Charming', 'excellent', 'word', 'film', 'lyrical', 'quirkiness', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Anderson', 'films', 'be', 'Rushmore', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Aquatic', 'Life', 'latest', 'effort', 'Moonrise', 'Kingdom.Besides', 'quick', 'pace', 'wit', 'feeling', 'packed', 'about', '3', 'times', 'plot', 'many', 'live-action', 'films', 'today', 'also', 'great', 'voice', 'cast', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'not', 'mention', 'talented', 'unknowns', 'writing', 'funny', 'insightful', 'clever', 'again', 'moves', 'breezy', 'clip', 'just', 'movie.The', 'style', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'high', 'point', 'feel', 'costuming', 'recall', 'stop-motion', 'techniques', 'films', 'back', '1940s', ""'50s"", 'kind', 'retro', 'look', 'might', 'get', 'haunting', 'short', 'animated', 'films', 'age', 'be', 'artist', 'iron', 'curtain', 'imagination', 'George', 'Pal', 'later', 'creator', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'Destination', 'Moon', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Time', 'Machine', '.Either', 'way', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'entire', 'family', 'come', 'away', 'enthralled']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

1231790,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001QOGYBI,RMurray847,"[14, 16]","My family and I saw FANTASTIC MR. FOX on Thanksgiving, one of the busiest movie-going evenings of the year.  We were in a group of about 30 folks watching this film...a sad statement.  It's one of the wittiest (not just funny, but witty) animated films in a long time, and a truly original piece of filmmaking.  When movies like PLANET 51 or ...CHANCE OF MEATBALLS can make 5 times as much at the box office, I can only bemoan how many people have caused their kids (and themselves) to miss out on the experience of seeing how challenging films can be, and how much FUN that can be.Director Wes Anderson is one of my favorite filmmakers.  I know there are MANY people who agree, and MANY MORE who disagree fairly vehemently.  For everyone who loved DARJEELING LIMITED, many more found it inert, pretentious, boring or unemotional.  Ditto ROYAL TENNANBAUMS.  Double ditto LIFE AQUATIC.  I admit, Anderson can be a bit ""clever"" in his style.  He films everything from a lower than usual angle.  His camera either sits still or moves side to side...seldom in and out.  He keeps us at a distance this way...much like his characters tend to be emotionally distant or shut off.  The humor in his scripts is often dry and laced with sadness.  When his characters to express their emotional sides, it comes in short bursts that demonstrates a form of being stunted.  His characters are super smart, and very unwise.Yet in FANTASTIC MR. FOX, even Anderson's critics are finding much to love.  The same filmmaking style is there, but there is also something charming about the way in which he trains his camera on these awkwardly animated figures.  They are frequently filmed at ""odd"" angles, but what this does is allow us to SEE more of the character than we might in a more traditionally framed movie.  His reduced depth-of-field works even better with animation...particularly animation this ""crude.""  (It isn't really crude, don't freak out.)Adapted from the Roahld Dahl story, MR. FOX follows its title character...a dashing, daring young scoundrel of a fox who gives up his dangerous life of chicken-thieving and living on the edge in order to settle down with the love of his life and have a family.  Skip ahead some time, and the Foxes are living in an underground den, where dad is a newspaper reporter (an endangered species?) and his son constantly disappoints him by having a singularly UNdaring nature.  Fox is a good husband and father, but his true nature constantly nags at him, and in a mad burst, he purchases an above ground tree in which to live.  And from there, he can clearly see the facilities of three big, evil farmers.  And it's a short step from there to returning (albeit without telling his wife) to a life of thieving and trickery.  It makes him feel young again and makes him feel he's being true to his nature.  It also gets him, his family and the whole animal community into some SERIOUS trouble.There really isn't much to the plot, per se.  The film is more about little incidents, observations and conversations.  And it's all shown to us via stop-motion animation.  These furry animals move in a manner frankly reminiscent of the original KING KONG.  We see their fur move from frame to frame, where the animators clearly were manipulating the little creatures.  They are primitively constructed...and yet the film is 100% true to its own aesthetic throughout.  While many scenes look flat (and everything is brown)...there is a feeling of life in every moment.  It may be the rippling fur, and it may be the outstanding voice work.George Clooney plays Mr. Fox and his wife is voiced by Meryl Streep.  Jason Schwartzmann is their cowardly, clumsy son.  These 3 work together very well, and although I wasn't sitting there the whole time noticing that stars were doing the voices...there was also a sense of familiarity that was very welcome.  Clooney has become a master of the ""wacky"" character (MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS, BURN AFTER READING, LEATHERHEADS)...and this movie shows that it is his voice as much as his physicality that makes this work.  Schwartzmann plays the ""dreary"" son much like we'd expect him to...infused with chagrin and sadness.As I mentioned, Anderson's humor is often coupled with sadness...and we have that here too.  Whether Fox is longing for his past life, or his wife wishes her husband was happy with what he had or their son wishes Dad was prouder of him...that sense of sadness is there.  These are the richest animated characters in a long time (outside of most Pixar films)...and it's easy to care about these funny looking creatures.  There are many delightful other characters as well, including badgers (Bill Murray, hilarious), moles and so on.But the movie can be readily enjoyed without reading much into it.  It's got loads of off-kilter humor (the shots of Fox eating are almost worth the price of admission!), a GREAT soundtrack (Anderson is almost as good as Tarantino at picking great music) and a satisfying conclusion, one that delivers a Hollywood feel, but is uniquely odd as well.So please do yourself (and the film) a favor, and check out FANTASTIC MR. FOX.  It is, indeed, fantastic.",4,4.5 stars for this pretty fantastic little film.,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,5163,"['family', 'saw', 'FANTASTIC', 'MR.', 'FOX', 'Thanksgiving', 'one', 'busiest',

1231791,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001QOGYBI,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","While I think UP was the finest animated film of the year, THE FANTASTIC MR. FOX was in my opinion the second best animated film of 2009.  As stop action it isn't as polished as Nick Park's films along the same lines (which pretty much remains the Rolls Royce of stop animation), but it has virtues of its own, including absolutely spectacular voice over work, especially by George Clooney in the title role, though Bill Murray as the Badger and Michael Gambon as a deliciously evil farmer.  The film is also laced with remarkable wit and intelligence.  The result is one of the freshest, most original animated films that I have seen in a long, long time.When my my daughter was very young we read through just about all of Roald Dahl's books.  This was just about the only one that we didn't read, so I have absolutely no idea whether this is in any way faithful to the original.

1231792,A18TLRH5PKAS4S,B001QOGYBI,Rodney Bucket,"[3, 4]","""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a fun movie. Its stop-motion animation is surprisingly beautiful, and the design of the settings and characters combined with the effect creates a movie that is a visual pleasure to watch. It tells the story of the Fox family, whose patriarch, the titular Mr. Fox, incurs the wrath of three neighboring farmers who engage the family in an all-out war.An all-star cast lend their voices to these characters, including George Clooney as Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep as his wife, and Bill Murray as their badger friend, Badger. The actors give a quirky charm to the characters, and make them endearing and entertaining to watch as they fend off the warring farmers. The action is set to an excellent score by Alexandre Desplat, and has a strong spaghetti Western influence.The screenplay is lacking at times. Writer/director Wes Anderson is a darling of ""indie"" culture, and his style is a little forced in this film; some of the lines come off as overly self-conscious and forcedly quirky, but overall this does not diminish the zany charm and fun of the movie. If nothing else, it's worth a watch to see its gorgeous animation, and it's certain to leave a smile on your face.",4,"Visually beautiful, fun movie",1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,1190,"['Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'fun', 'movie', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'surprisingly', 'beautiful', 'design', 'settings', 'characters', 'combined', 'effect', 'movie', 'visual', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'story', 'Fox', 'family', 'patriarch', 'titular', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'wrath', 'three', 'neighboring', 'farmers', 'who', 'engage', 'family', 'all-out', 'war.An', 'all-star', 'cast', 'lend', 'voices', 'characters', 'including', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'wife', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'badger', 'friend', 'Badger', 'actors', 'give', 'quirky', 'charm', 'characters', 'make', 'endearing', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'fend', 'warring', 'farmers', 'action', 'set', 'excellent', 'score', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'strong', 'spaghetti', 'Western', 'influence.The', 'screenplay', 'lacking', 'times', 'Writer/director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'darling', 'indie', 'culture', 'style', 'little', 'forced', 'film', 'lines', 'come', 'off', 'overly', 'self-conscious', 'forcedly', 'quirky', 'overall', 'not', 'diminish', 'zany', 'charm', 'fun', 'movie', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'see', 'gorgeous', 'animation', 'certain', 'leave', 'smile', 'face']",Fantastic Mr. Fox
1231793,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001QOGYBI,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","For those who've grown just a wee bit tired of all those ""family-friendly"" animated features we've been inundated with over the years, I commend to you ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" Wes Anderson's sly little creation that, for once, is aimed less at the kids in the audience than at the adults. Not that it is particularly crude or vulgar - it's certainly no ""Fritz the Cat,"" and even the swearing is covered-over by the characters uttering a generic ""cuss"" - but its themes and dialogue are pitched at a generally higher level of sophistication than we are accustomed to in such works.Based on a book by the beloved Roald Dahl, the story focuses on the dapper Mr. Fox, a recovering chicken thief who, at the behest of his wife, has given up his predatory ways in favor of domestic responsibility as a husband and father and a career as a newspaper columnist. What could be more respectable than that?  But old habits die hard, and Mr. Fox soon discovers he must remain true to his carnivorous nature, leading him to enlist a few of his friends and neighbors of various species in a scheme to raid some local farms and make off with their poultry. This lands him and his buddies in hot water with both the owners of the farms and the heavily armed authorities who are called in to support them.Like Anderson's live-action works, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" (co-written by Noah Baumbach) owes much of its charm to the scattered, random and quirky nature of the material and its presentation, with a narrative so full of side forays and offbeat, eccentric characters that the movie feels as if it's constantly renewing itself as it's going along. There is wonderful voice work by George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe, clever in-joke references to spaghetti westerns and ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" a funny subplot involving Fox's son and his obsession with proving his athletic prowess to his inattentive dad, and a simple, clean, streamlined look that combines a minimum of stop-motion movement with remarkably true-to-life backgrounds.It may not be a great animated film, but it is one of the more original and refreshing ones we've come across in quite some time.",4,"Fantastic is certainly the word for it, all right",1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,2198,"['who', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'just', 'wee', 'bit', 'tired', 'family-friendly', 'animated', 'features', ""'ve"", 'been', 'inundated', 'years', 'commend', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'sly', 'little', 'creation', 'once', 'aimed', 'less', 'kids', 'audience', 'adults', 'Not', 'particularly', 'crude', 'vulgar', 'certainly', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'even', 'swearing', 'covered-over', 'characters', 'uttering', 'generic', 'cuss', 'themes', 'dialogue', 'are', 'pitched', 'generally', 'higher', 'level', 'sophistication', 'are', 'accustomed', 'such', 'works.Based', 'book', 'beloved', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'story', 'dapper', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'recovering', 'chicken', 'thief', 'who', 'behest', 'wife', 'given', 'up', 'predatory', 'ways', 'favor', 'domestic', 'responsibility', 'husband', 'father', 'career', 'newspaper', 'columnist', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'respectable', 'old', 'habits', 'die', 'hard', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'soon', 'must', 'remain', 'true', 'carnivorous', 'nature', 'leading', 'enlist', 'few', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'various', 'species', 'scheme', 'raid', 'local', 'farms', 'make', 'off', 'poultry', 'buddies', 'hot', 'water', 'owners', 'farms', 'heavily', 'armed', 'authorities', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'support', 'Anderson', 'live-action', 'works', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'co-written', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'much', 'charm', 'scattered', 'random', 'quirky', 'nature', 'material', 'presentation', 'narrative', 'full', 'side', 'forays', 'offbeat', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'movie', 'feels', 'constantly', 'renewing', 'going', 'along', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'work', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'clever', 'in-joke', 'references', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'funny', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Fox', 'son', 'obsession', 'proving', 'athletic', 'prowess', 'inattentive', 'dad', 'simple', 'clean', 'streamlined', 'look', 'minimum', 'stop-motion', 'movement', 'remarkably', 'true-to-life', 'backgrounds.It', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'animated', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'original', 'refreshing', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'come', 'quite', 'time']",Fantastic Mr. Fox
1231794,A3OD9DU3A0NCCI,B001QOGYBI,Roochak,"[4, 4]","Filmmaker Wes Anderson is a specialist in comedies about the fault lines in the American dream. ""Rushmore"" concerns a prep school student, a middle-aged millionaire, and their romantic rivalry over a woman who doesn't want either of them. ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" examines a family of former prodigies and what happens when their estranged, deadbeat father re-enters their lives, while ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" imagines a Jacques Costeau type adventurer as a combination of Don Quixote and Captain Ahab. Anderson's new film, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" is the story of an aging family man who risks everything to recapture the thrill of his youth. It's set in an imaginary England where all the animal characters talk with American accents, and, along with the steampunk-influenced ""Sherlock Holmes,"" it's one of the two new pictures I've most enjoyed this year.Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) writes a newspaper column that even his friends don't seem to read, but it provides a comfortable living for his family. The trouble begins when he buys a new home near those of three grotesque farmers: rotund Boggis, dwarfish Bunce, and pencil-thin Bean (voiced by Michael Gambon), the smartest and most dangerous of the three. Mr. Fox, despite his promises to his wife Felicity (voiced to self-possessed perfection by Meryl Streep), reverts to his wild side in a series of nocturnal raids that brings down the wrath of the vindictive trio on himself, his family, and nearly all the wildlife in the area.Even without all this, there's trouble in the Fox household between the Foxes' sad sack son, Ash, and his visiting cousin Kristofferson, a martial artist, athlete and student of Eastern meditation who outclasses him in just about everything. Ash responds with all the petty adolescent cruelties at his disposal, but he remains basically invisible to his father, a master thief and escape artist who can't understand why his son can't do much more than dress up like a comic book superhero.The passage of time is an important part of this movie; two human years equals twelve fox years, and Mr. Fox notes that his father died at almost the same age he is now, leading him to wonder if he stopped being true to himself by giving up a life of crime; you get the feeling that he enjoys using the word ""existential"" without knowing what it means. It's underplayed, as all Wes Anderson comedies are underplayed, and the stop motion puppet animation looks, paradoxically, more lifelike than the typical CG animation we're now used to. One reason I find this movie so enjoyable is that it's an absurd, wickedly funny, thoughtful comedy that leaves the viewer time and room to think and savor the many verbal, visual, and musical jokes that pack the film (as opposed to the bludgeoning sitcom stupidity of most recent animated comedies).I haven't found myself awaiting a home video release this eagerly in years.",5,"Fantastic Mr. Anderson, Now in Fox-Time",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,2909,"['Filmmaker', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'specialist', 'comedies', 'fault', 'lines', 'American', 'dream', 'Rushmore', 'prep', 'school', 'student', 'middle-aged', 'millionaire', 'romantic', 'rivalry', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'Royal', 'Tennenbaums', 'family', 'former', 'prodigies', 'what', 'when', 'estranged', 'deadbeat', 'father', 're-enters', 'lives', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'Jacques', 'Costeau', 'type', 'adventurer', 'combination', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'Captain', 'Ahab', 'Anderson', 'new', 'film', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'story', 'aging', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'everything', 'recapture', 'thrill', 'youth', 'set', 'imaginary', 'England', 'where', 'animal', 'characters', 'talk', 'American', 'accents', 'steampunk-influenced', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'one', 'two', 'new', 'pictures', ""'ve"", 'most', 'enjoyed', 'year.Mr', 'Fox', 'voiced', 'George', 'Clooney', 'newspaper', 'column', 'even', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'read', 'comfortable', 'living', 'family', 'trouble', 'when', 'new', 'home', 'three', 'grotesque', 'farmers', 'rotund', 'Boggis', 'dwarfish', 'Bunce', 'pencil-thin', 'Bean', 'voiced', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'smartest', 'most', 'dangerous', 'three', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'promises', 'wife', 'Felicity', 'voiced', 'self-possessed', 'perfection', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'wild', 'side', 'series', 'nocturnal', 'raids', 'down', 'wrath', 'vindictive', 'trio', 'family', 'nearly', 'wildlife', 'area.Even', 'trouble', 'Fox', 'household', 'Foxes', 'sad', 'sack', 'son', 'Ash', 'visiting', 'cousin', 'Kristofferson', 'martial', 'artist', 'athlete', 'student', 'Eastern', 'meditation', 'who', 'just', 'everything', 'Ash', 'petty', 'adolescent', 'cruelties', 'disposal', 'basically', 'invisible', 'father', 'master', 'thief', 'escape', 'artist', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'son', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'more', 'dress', 'up', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero.The', 'passage', 'time', 'important', 'part', 'movie', 'two', 'human', 'years', 'equals', 'twelve', 'fox', 'years', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'father', 'died', 'almost', 'same', 'age', 'now', 'leading', 'wonder', 'stopped', 'being', 'true', 'giving', 'up', 'life', 'crime', 'get', 'feeling', 'using', 'word', 'existential', 'knowing', 'what', 'underplayed', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'comedies', 'are', 'underplayed', 'stop', 'motion', 'puppet', 'animation', 'paradoxically', 'more', 'lifelike', 'typical', 'CG', 'animation', ""'re"", 'now', 'used', 'One', 'reason', 'find', 'movie', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'absurd', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'thoughtful', 'comedy', 'viewer', 'time', 'room', 'think', 'savor', 'many', 'verbal', 'visual', 'musical', 'jokes', 'pack', 'film', 'opposed', 'bludgeoning', 'sitcom', 'stupidity', 'most', 'recent', 'animated', 'comedies', '.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'awaiting', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'eagerly', 'years']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

All I knew is that it came highly regarded, was based on a Roald Dahl children's book, featured George Clooney, and was a creation of Wes Anderson.  With that combination, anything can happen.  So, I gave it a whirl.When people talk about art, what makes good art is something that affects you in a way that nothing else ever has.  That is what this movie is.  Like mismatching wallpaper, or sacarine tastes, this movie will make you taste something that you have never tasted before, and see color and object combinations that your eyes have never seen together.  So, like excellent bitter coffee, at first you'll wince, and then you'll ask for more.Now, I have to say, I'm not exactly sure that this movie, despite being an animated movie, is for young children.  There are some scenes of questionable nature that I would wait until my child was at least in their tweens before I let them watch it.  But that's just me.Just so that you know what it is about, the first 1/3 of the movie is about the main character, Mr. Fox - a daredevil, wise-cracking, and stubborn local fox, who used to live a life of stealing chickens - settling down with his adorable mate - once she announces that she is pregnant with their first child.  It fast-forwards a couple years, to show him plotting a way to get back into the chicken-stealing business without his mate finding out.  Sort of like living the old days.The second 2/3 of the movie is all about those repercussions - as he takes on three vicious and vengeful farmers all at the same time.  They (all the main characters of adorable local fauna) spend the last hour trying to outsmart the farmers in a tit-for-tat game of one-up-manship.The story is good.  The animation, visuals, and sound are excellent.  The interaction and character play is awesome.  All trademarks of a Wes Anderson movie done with the best of the best talent in actors and techinical people that we have.About what I said above about it might not be suitable to younger ages, if you saw ""Chicken Run"" from the early 2000s, then this movie is very much like it.  You have a fox who is trying to kill chickens, turkey, and other prey, while the farmers are trying to kill him.  So, while there is slaughter, it happens off-screen, but it still happens.

When they find themselves in an inescapable trap (which they do escape from), Fox promises never to do the old henhouse stealing ever again.Except one day, years later, he just has to do that one last job.  That one last job, in three parts, to hassle the worst humans ever.  With the help of a possum, they make their moves undetected.  Meeting the disapproval of his family he promises never to do it again.Too late!  The human farmers are the epitome of bad manners, obsessive dolts ever.  The story gets into their efforts to root out the foxes and destroy them.  This is where the story dragged for me.  The antics of the farmers and how the animals fight back is fun, but could have been trimmed down a bit.Themes:  The themes of accepting who you are (after you find out what that is) was an interesting lesson in humility and personal fortitude.  I enjoyed that a lot.  And I think kids watching this will get that too.  It's OK to be different rather than pretend to be something you're not.I did enjoy the way the animals lived like people - the athletic field, the complex rules of some sport games, the parodies of lawyers and crazy corporations - but it tries to cover too much.  An edited approach I think would have been better.The film is based on the story of the same name by Roald Dahl.Recommended!Cast:Directed byWes AndersonWriting creditsRoald Dahl(novel)Wes Anderson(screenplay) &Noah Baumbach(screenplay)Cast (in credits order)George Clooney...

Horrible writing is what it boiled down to, it was visually appealing but the entire time I just felt like it was trying to be cleaver in the dialog but just never got to a intelligence level above a below average 10 year old.  It also was cast very poorly, none of the voices added anything to the characters.Like I said I didn't expect much but usually when I go into a movie like this I get more than a bargained for.  This movie was just dull and drug on and on for what seemed like ever.  I would NOT recommend buying this unless you rent it first and for some odd reason end up liking it.  I had heard that young kids don't like it, it is hard for them to sit through a long unfunny movie, and it is not witty in anyway so I confused as to who this movie was aimed at.There is one odd part of the movie, I don't know if it was in the book, where Mr. Fox has a dialog about a wolf he sees in the distance.  I think it is supposed to be significant in some way since it just does not fit into the story.

1231801,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B001QOGYBI,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","`Fantastic Mr Fox' is a delightful stop animation film based upon the Roald Dahl book of the same name. The first half of the film remains relatively faithful to the original storyline (with the addition of a few new characters) but the second half takes it in a slightly different, but no less satisfying direction. Essentially Mr Fox steals various farm produce from three unsavoury farmers who then go out of their way to hunt him and his family down to kill them. Mr Fox is as cunning as a....well a fox, and he finds various ways to outsmart the farmers and amuse us in the process. This has numerous animation touches that made me laugh out loud and made this an especially enjoyable film and the overall animation is excellent throughout. The voice cast is very impressive and well matched to their respective characters and the direction was truly superb. The soundtrack which pretty good as well. I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would and after hearing some disappointing things about this film (generally from fans of the book) I was pleasantly surprised with the high calibre of film making on offer. The best way to gain the most enjoyment from this film is to view it as a separate entity to the book and if you do this you will be in for one wonderful, humorous and spell binding film experience.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",5,Fantastic Mr Fox,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,1388,"['Fantastic', 'Mr', 'Fox', 'delightful', 'stop', 'animation', 'film', 'based', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'relatively', 'faithful', 'original', 'storyline', 'addition', 'few', 'new', 'characters', 'second', 'half', 'slightly', 'different', 'less', 'satisfying', 'direction', 'Essentially', 'Mr', 'Fox', 'various', 'farm', 'produce', 'three', 'unsavoury', 'farmers', 'who', 'then', 'go', 'way', 'hunt', 'family', 'down', 'kill', 'Mr', 'Fox', 'as', 'cunning', '.well', 'fox', 'various', 'ways', 'outsmart', 'farmers', 'amuse', 'process', 'numerous', 'animation', 'touches', 'made', 'loud', 'made', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'overall', 'animation', 'excellent', 'voice', 'cast', 'very', 'impressive', 'well', 'matched', 'respective', 'characters', 'direction', 'was', 'truly', 'superb', 'soundtrack', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'hearing', 'disappointing', 'things', 'film', 'generally', 'fans', 'book', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'high', 'calibre', 'film', 'making', 'offer', 'best', 'way', 'gain', 'most', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'view', 'separate', 'entity', 'book', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'wonderful', 'humorous', 'spell', 'binding', 'film', 'experience.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

1231804,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B001QOGYBI,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 3]","Fantastic Mr. Fox (animation, adventure, comedy)Directed by Wes AndersonStarring the voices of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray and Michael Gambon20th Century Fox | 2009 | 87 min | Rated PG | Released Mar 23, 2010Video:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 1.85:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1French: Dolby Digital 5.1Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles:English, French, Mandarin (Simplified and Traditional), Portuguese, SpanishDiscs:50GB Blu-ray DiscDVD copy (with digital copy)*Spoilers within*Wes Anderson's films are traditionally quirky and full of complex themes, and his adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox is no different. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's animated (stop motion); this material is not targeted at children.When we join the story, Mrs. Fox (Streep) is telling Mr. Fox (Clooney) that she's pregnant. The two proceed to rob a chicken farm and narrowly escape capture. Mrs. Fox makes him promise to look for other work now that they are about to become parents. Mr. Fox agrees and finds a job writing a newspaper column.Mr. Fox settles down in his new life, but always regrets giving up his old ways. He's also tired of living in a hole in the ground and wants a better home for his family. He goes to see Badger (Murray), who advises him about properties for sale in the area. Fox wants a house near three local farms, but Badger suggests that the neighborhood is too dangerous. The local children even have a rhyme about the farmers:Boggis, Bunce and BeanOne fat, one short, one leanThese horrible crooksSo different in looksWere nonetheless equally meanFox is aware of the danger, but yearns for his former chicken-stealing days. As Anderson regularly reminds us, these are wild animals. Fox can't deny his nature and buys the new house so that he can be close to the three farms.His decision goes directly against his promise to his wife and that was his first mistake.There's a lot of humor in the film, but it's generally quite subtle. The family sits down to eat dinner and they eat like wild animals. The food is gone in seconds. Their son, Ash, is moody and craves attention from his father. He spits on the floor when he's angry or disappointed and he clearly has problems. When his cousin Kristofferson comes to stay, the situation worsens. Fox seems to favor Kristofferson over his own son and compliments him constantly.Forget that we're dealing with animals for a moment and think about the story. If that happened in a regular movie, we would be dealing with a typical family drama. Husband and wife break promises and have trust issues, while their son is being raised by parents who don't understand him. This is not the kind of story that small children would understand, although some of the scenes are funny and contain action that would appeal to a child.Fox enlists the help of Kylie Opossum and the two steal chickens from Boggis. The action is typical animated fare and the way the two sneak around is funny. They lace blueberries with a sedative to get past the dogs and the way the dogs react is also funny. They successfully steal from Bunce and plan to stop once they steal cider from Bean. For the final robbery, Ash wants to come along. Fox won't let him, but allows Kristofferson to take part. He seems to have very little idea that such a decision could hurt his son's feelings.The robberies are fun to watch, especially when the animals wear bandit hats. It reminds me of the robbery in Bottle Rocket when the participants decide to wear similar hats even though their victims have already seen their faces.Ash yearns to be an athlete and wants to emulate his father's success at Whack-Bat (a game which parodies cricket). Kristofferson is a balanced individual who regularly meditates and knows karate. Ash is extremely jealous of his cousin and his ability to win his father's approval.The three robberies annoy the farmers, so Bean (Gambon) decides to organize the trio and plans to kill Fox. This is where the film starts to take on a more serious tone. Mrs. Fox discovers that her husband has been lying to her and scratches his face in a fit of temper. This scene annoyed one of my friends who expected the film to be lighthearted and suitable for the whole family. Mrs. Fox acts like the wild animal she is. There's another scene in which one of the animals is maimed. Although it's presented in a humorous way, it could disturb people.The remainder of the film deals with the three farmers finding ways to threaten the existence of Fox and his friends. They escape by tunneling deeper, but face the threat of starvation if they don't find a solution. Some of the other animals resent Fox for putting them in such a dangerous situation.There's considerable peril which could worry small children, and a lot of humor which would probably fly over their heads. It was only given a PG-rating, but be aware that not every child will like this harsh world. The animals are true to their nature.The reason I like the film so much is the style of humor. Like Bottle Rocket and The Darjeeling Limited, the characters speak with a sense of irony or sarcasm and most of the humor is tongue-in-cheek. It feels similar to Tarantino or the Coen brothers at times. There's no swearing, but every character uses the word ""cuss"" in situations in which they would normally swear. I found that particularly funny. One animal questions why a ransom note was made using words cut out of a magazine when everyone already knew the identities of the kidnappers. That's also funny to me. The missions all have elaborate titles and remind me of the way Tarantino uses chapters in his stories.Fantastic Mr. Fox is an exercise in style. Mr. Fox himself is very stylish, dressing smartly and using his trademark whistle when he thinks he's being clever or cool. Clooney was a great choice for the part and the other actors all do a good job too.The story is essentially about a dysfunctional family and shows how Ash attempts to come to terms with his existence. Will Mr. Fox eventually become a better father? Will Ash grow up and take responsibility for his own actions? Do Mr. and Mrs. Fox strengthen their marriage, or will the trust issues tear them apart? There's a lot going on beneath the surface.Video Quality 5/5The look of Fantastic Mr. Fox is virtually flawless. The frames were shot digitally with a high quality camera and the detail is superb throughout. You can see every hair on the puppets and the stitches in their clothing. Some scenes look deliberately flat when shot from a distance and the color palette is full of brown and yellow tints, but that's all intentional too. I didn't spot any errors in a single shot and the presentation looks as good as anything I've seen.Audio Quality 4/5The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track has its moments, despite the quiet nature of the film. Most of the story is driven by dialogue, but there are occasional bursts of sound in scenes involving music or explosions. The rear speakers aren't used prominently, but there's no cause for complaint overall.Special Features 3/5The features were all shot in high definition.Making Mr. Fox Fantastic (45 minutes) - A six-part feature which can also be viewed all at once. Topics include the look of the film, how it was adapted from the book and how the puppets were made. There's an in-depth look at the filming process and a look at the actors behind the voices. The final segment shows Bill Murray talking to some of the animators.A Beginner's Guide to Whack-Bat (1 minute)Fantastic Mr. Fox: The World of Roald Dahl (3 minutes) - Touching on the main points shown in the opening feature.Trailer (2 minutes)Fantastic Mr. Fox has a lot of intelligent humor and subtle charm and it's clearly aimed at adult audiences. I wouldn't rule out showing the film to children, but be aware that wild animals sometimes show their true nature and their world can be brutal. I'm a fan of Wes Anderson's work and this met all my expectations in terms of style and humor. It's one of the most complex and unusual animated titles I have seen and recommended for fans of subtle humor. The world is an interesting place to visit and the film is a lot of fun if you go in with the right expectations.Overall score 4.5/5",5,Wes Anderson's signature style shines through,1308614400,"06 21,

I don't know how many people worked on it, but they didn't get enough credit.  Fabulous movement of the creatures, the settings where rich and amazing and the creation of smoke and froth (rabid hound) were awesome.The humor was top shelf.  The use of ""cuss"" as a swear was awesome.  Whackbat is as creative a game as you can get, and perfect b/c it makes no sense.The characters were great.  They were all so deep and interesting, with their own little quirks.  I feel movie characters are not unique enough and they run together, but not in this movie.  Granted, a lot of the characters were different species, but they all had something about them that made them unique.  Very well thought out by the writer.The actors who did this were superb.  If I hadn't been told it was George Clooney as Mr. Fox, I would have never known.  It's as if he really got into the character and allowed the character to manifest itself through him, not the other way around (such as Ellen does in Finding Nemo).The soundtrack is very entertaining.  It fits perfectly with the movie and the scenes.  It never overpowers what's happening, just adds to the scene.Ok, so it must be addressed.  This movie does not follow the book at all.  There are a couple similarities between the two (mainly the names of the characters and the fact that the farmers are after the fox), but it is it's own unique creation.

1231817,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B001QOGYBI,V. Berk,"[4, 5]","When I first heard word of Wes Anderson adapting one of Roald Dahl's books I of course instantly was both interested and concerned.  Being a Houstonian I have always felt inclined to support the work of Houston-born writer/director Wes Anderson.Thus far I've enjoyed his dry sense of humor; kind of like an Americanized version of British humor...but it is also very adult, sophisticated humor, so I couldn't imagine him doing a family movie.After seeing the movie I have one thing to say...Fantastic Mr. Fox certainly is FANTASTIC!  Wes Anderson has made one of the best films of 2009; one that is just as good as his other movies, if not being his best yet!  Everything, from voice-actors, to the use of stop animation: this film is perfectly balanced in what is certainly the best comedy of the year.How did Wes Anderson pull it off?  Well, he honestly didn't make this so much as a kid's movie as he did make another entry in his series of odd-ball comedies- only this time cutting back mature subjects to a PG-rating.  What results is a very mature comedy that doesn't resort to cheap gimmicks or slapstick for laughs (though there is a bit of slapstick for those kids who won't understand the humor in Anderson's dialog).The story centers on Mr. Fox (voiced by the always entertaining George Clooney), who is the foxiest fox who ever foxed.  An expert chicken thief he likes living dangerously...that is until his lover (voiced by Meryl Streep) becomes pregnant and demands that they settle down.  After getting caught in a fox trap he agrees to her terms that if they survive he shall never steal again.Two years later (which is far more in fox years) the couple is living in a hole with their son, Ash (Jason Schwartzmen).  Mr. Fox is a newspaper columnist, who is fairly certain no one actual reads his column and is now upset that he won't amount to anything (like his father) so he decides they must move out.  His choice is a tree, but this tree happens to be located next door to the three meanest farmers the animals have ever seen.  His lawyer, Badger (voiced by Anderson regular Bill Murray) tries to talk Fox out of his choice home, but he won't hear it.After moving to the tree they are joined by their nephew Kristofferson (voiced by Eric Chase Anderson) who quickly becomes Ash's center of jealousy.  Kristofferson is perfect in just about every way, spending his time meditating while practicing yoga, being naturally gifted in sports - everything Ash wishes he was.But while those trivial matters go on Mr. Fox can't resist the call of the wild, and with his opossum building superintendent, Kylie (voiced by Wallace Wolodarsky) plans a return to his dangerous life of ""cussing with"" the farmers' heads.  At first this starts as simple crimes, but soon the farmers declare war against Mr. Fox and the entire animal populace!  It becomes the job of Fox save everyone from the farmers' wrath...which he caused!There's also a great (not to mention HILARIOUS) bit involving Willem Dafoe as an insane, finger snapping rat-henchman under the employ of the farmers, but I wouldn't spoil that for the you! You'll have to see the movie to get what I'm talking about.Fantastic Mr. Fox of course differs from its source material, but for what it is Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great comedy.  I say ""comedy"" instead of ""animation"" or ""Family"" movie because its values really are more comedy oriented than they are trying to entertain an entire group of people.  In fact, the theater I saw this movie in was full of kids under the age of 10 and very seldom did any of them laugh: the humor was just way over their heads, and I won't hold that against them.For adults and mat kids over the age of 10 or so Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fantasy comedy full of whimsical characters that will leave them chuckling, and quoting its ingenious script long after they've left the theater.  Parents can also approve of the film's message of ""everyone has their own individual talents,"" be it thief, landscape artist, or demolitions expert.It won't stand up against a movie like Pixar's Up in a `Best Animated Feature' contest, but then again I doubt it was even trying to.  What the movie does is set out to be a sophisticated comedy - something that is rated PG, but is just as good as any comedy directly aimed at older audiences.  Fantastic Mr. Fox is rated PG but is more adult and sophisticated than this year's smash hit The Hangover.Fantastic Mr. Fox truly is the most fantastic movie of the year.",5,Best comedy of the year!,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,4492,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'word', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'adapting', 'one', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'books', 'course', 'instantly', 'was', 'interested', 'concerned', 'Being', 'Houstonian', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'inclined', 'support', 'work', 'Houston-born', 'writer/director', 'Wes', 'Anderson.Thus', 'far', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'kind', 'Americanized', 'version', 'British', 'humor', 'also', 'very', 'adult', 'sophisticated', 'humor', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'doing', 'family', 'movie.After', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'say', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'certainly', 'FANTASTIC', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'made', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2009', 'one', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'movies', 'not', 'being', 'best', 'yet', 'Everything', 'voice-actors', 'use', 'stop', 'animation', 'film', 'perfectly', 'balanced', 'what', 'certainly', 'best', 'comedy', 'year.How', 'did', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'pull', 'off', 'Well', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'so', 'much', 'kid', 'movie', 'did', 'make', 'entry', 'series', 'odd-ball', 'comedies-', 'only', 'time', 'cutting', 'back', 'mature', 'subjects', 'PG-rating', 'What', 'results', 'very', 'mature', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'resort', 'cheap', 'gimmicks', 'slapstick', 'laughs', 'bit', 'slapstick', 'kids', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'humor', 'Anderson', 'dialog', 'story', 'centers', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'voiced', 'always', 'entertaining', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'foxiest', 'fox', 'who', 'ever', 'foxed', 'expert', 'chicken', 'thief', 'living', 'dangerously', 'lover', 'voiced', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'pregnant', 'demands', 'settle', 'down', 'getting', 'caught', 'fox', 'trap', 'terms', 'survive', 'shall', 'never', 'steal', 'again.Two', 'years', 'later', 'far', 'more', 'fox', 'years', 'couple', 'living', 'hole', 'son', 'Ash', 'Jason', 'Schwartzmen', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'newspaper', 'columnist', 'who', 'fairly', 'certain', 'one', 'actual', 'column', 'now', 'upset', 'wo', ""n't"", 'amount', 'anything', 'father', 'so', 'must', 'move', 'out', 'choice', 'tree', 'tree', 'be', 'located', 'next', 'door', 'three', 'meanest', 'farmers', 'animals', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'lawyer', 'Badger', 'voiced', 'Anderson', 'regular', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'talk', 'Fox', 'choice', 'home', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'it.After', 'moving', 'tree', 'are', 'joined', 'nephew', 'Kristofferson', 'voiced', 'Eric', 'Chase', 'Anderson', 'who', 'quickly', 'Ash', 'center', 'jealousy', 'Kristofferson', 'perfect', 'just', 'way', 'spending', 'time', 'meditating', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'being', 'naturally', 'gifted', 'sports', 'everything', 'Ash', 'was.But', 'trivial', 'matters', 'go', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'call', 'wild', 'opossum', 'building', 'superintendent', 'Kylie', 'voiced', 'Wallace', 'Wolodarsky', 'return', 'dangerous', 'life', 'cussing', 'farmers', 'heads', 'first', 'as', 'simple', 'crimes', 'soon', 'farmers', 'declare', 'war', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'entire', 'animal', 'populace', 'job', 'Fox', 'save', 'everyone', 'farmers', 'wrath', 'caused', 'also', 'great', 'not', 'mention', 'HILARIOUS', 'bit', 'involving', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'insane', 'finger', 'snapping', 'rat-henchman', 'employ', 'farmers', 'would', ""n't"", 'spoil', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'get', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'about.Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'course', 'differs', 'source', 'material', 'what', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'great', 'comedy', 'say', 'comedy', 'instead', 'animation', 'Family', 'movie', 'values', 'really', 'are', 'more', 'comedy', 'oriented', 'are', 'trying', 'entertain', 'entire', 'group', 'people', 'fact', 'theater', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'full', 'kids', 'age', '10', 'very', 'seldom', 'did', 'laugh', 'humor', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'heads', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hold', 'them.For', 'adults', 'mat', 'kids', 'age', '10', 'so', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'fantasy', 'comedy', 'full', 'whimsical', 'characters', 'will', 'leave', 'chuckling', 'quoting', 'ingenious', 'script', 'long', ""'ve"", 'left', 'theater', 'Parents', 'can', 'also', 'approve', 'film', 'message', 'everyone', 'own', 'individual', 'talents', 'be', 'thief', 'landscape', 'artist', 'demolitions', 'expert.It', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'movie', 'Pixar', 'Up', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'contest', 'then', 'again', 'doubt', 'was', 'even', 'trying', 'What', 'movie', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'sophisticated', 'comedy', 'something', 'rated', 'PG', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'comedy', 'directly', 'aimed', 'older', 'audiences', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'rated', 'PG', 'more', 'adult', 'sophisticated', 'year', 'smash', 'hit', 'Hangover.Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'truly', 'most', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'year']",Fantastic Mr. Fox

Merryl Streep's lovely low tones, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and more. Stop animation has made huge strides even in the age of CGI, and can provide some of the most innovative and engaging imagery around. Basing a movie on a Roald Dahl book certainly won't hurt it, either - look what Dahl parentage did for 'James and the Giant Peach', the various Willie Wonkas, and lots of others.So, with all this going for it, the movie just didn't thrill me, and I'm not sure why. The animation, though thoroughly competent, rarely rose above competence - but did so nicely in the ""digging"" scenes and in any involving smoke. Characters grated on me, especially Mr. Fox himself, who I found irredeemably self-centered, the kind who tends to reward friends' loyalty with some pretty poor behavior. Also, I'll happily go along with a forestful of critters in educated professions and snappy tailoring. Within that context (and within his sharp-looking leisure suit), Fox's claim to being a wild animal rings false - unless ""wild"" means something more like a frat party than like a jungle.So, I kept the characters at arm's length, and the artistry wasn't enough to pull me in.

1231823,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001QOGYBI,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a sort of fairy tale for adults, and yet also appeals to children (on different levels of course). Mr. Fox, who is ably voiced by the talented George Clooney (all suave and composed, yet wild at heart - in the movie I mean:)) reminds us of the pitfalls of adulthood, of having to ""settle"" when one's soul yearns for something more, and Mr. Fox, who has made a promise to Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) many moons ago not to risk himself hunting chickens ever again, has ""settled"" into a stable yet boring life as a newspaper columnist. But Mr. Fox misses the adrenaline rush and excitement that comes with hunting - so he transplants his family (which includes a rather average son, Ash (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) who is constantly trying to prove himself to his accomplished father) to a tree which overlooks three farms, owned by the nasty farmers, Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. Before long, Fox is planning an assault on the farms, and gets an o'possum, Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky) to act as his reluctant sidekick, who also has a tendency to space out.Well, things don't go quite as planned (surprise, surprise), and Fox and family find themselves at the receiving end of the farmers' rage, led by Farmer Bean (Michael Gambon who credibly portrays the riled up English erm, 'gentleman'). So, it's up to wily Mr. Fox to get himself, his family, and the rest of the woodland creatures out of the mess he created. As fantastic as Mr. Fox is, the supporting cast makes this a great ensemble piece - there's the sneaky rat (Willem Dafoe), the badger lawyer (Bill Murray) who tries to dissuade Fox from purchasing the tree in the first place, Meryl Streep as Fox's wife, etc. In the capable hands of director Wes Anderson, ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" with its stop-motion adventure is a refreshing break from the series of insipid features passing of as ""family"" entertainment these days.Is this a movie for children? I think it's more of a film for adults and older children - there are no profanities in this film (all the expletives are replaced by the word ""cuss"", e.g. what the cuss? etc, so this needs to be explained to younger children), there is a fair amount of violence as the farmers use all sorts of methods to destroy the animals though it's not bloody or gory; some kissing between Fox and Mrs. Fox, scenes of the adult animals drinking, the farmer smoking etc. Final verdict - a fun movie that will delight the inner child and jaded adult in all of us.",5,"""I used to steal birds, but now I'm a newspaperman""",1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,2477,"['Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'sort', 'fairy', 'tale', 'adults', 'yet', 'also', 'appeals', 'children', 'different', 'levels', 'course', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'who', 'ably', 'voiced', 'talented', 'George', 'Clooney', 'suave', 'composed', 'yet', 'wild', 'heart', 'movie', 'mean', 'pitfalls', 'adulthood', 'having', 'settle', 'when', 'one', 'soul', 'yearns', 'something', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'who', 'made', 'promise', 'Mrs.', 'Fox', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'many', 'moons', 'ago', 'not', 'risk', 'hunting', 'chickens', 'ever', 'again', 'settled', 'stable', 'yet', 'boring', 'life', 'newspaper', 'columnist', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'excitement', 'hunting', 'so', 'family', 'rather', 'average', 'son', 'Ash', 'voiced', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'who', 'constantly', 'trying', 'prove', 'accomplished', 'father', 'tree', 'three', 'farms', 'owned', 'nasty', 'farmers', 'Boggis', 'Bunce', 'Bean', 'long', 'Fox', 'planning', 'assault', 'farms', ""o'possum"", 'Kylie', 'Wally', 'Wolodarsky', 'act', 'reluctant', 'sidekick', 'who', 'also', 'tendency', 'space', 'out.Well', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'quite', 'as', 'planned', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'Fox', 'family', 'find', 'receiving', 'end', 'farmers', 'rage', 'led', 'Farmer', 'Bean', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'who', 'credibly', 'riled', 'up', 'English', 'erm', ""'gentleman"", 'So', 'up', 'wily', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'get', 'family', 'rest', 'woodland', 'mess', 'created', 'As', 'fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'sneaky', 'rat', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'badger', 'lawyer', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'who', 'dissuade', 'Fox', 'purchasing', 'tree', 'first', 'place', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Fox', 'wife', 'etc', 'capable', 'hands', 'director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'stop-motion', 'adventure', 'refreshing', 'break', 'series', 'insipid', 'features', 'passing', 'family', 'entertainment', 'days.Is', 'movie', 'children', 'think', 'more', 'film', 'adults', 'older', 'children', 'are', 'profanities', 'film', 'expletives', 'are', 'replaced', 'word', 'cuss', 'e.g', 'what', 'cuss', 'etc', 'be', 'explained', 'younger', 'children', 'fair', 'amount', 'violence', 'farmers', 'use', 'sorts', 'methods', 'destroy', 'animals', 'not', 'bloody', 'gory', 'kissing', 'Fox', 'Mrs.', 'Fox', 'scenes', 'adult', 'animals', 'drinking', 'farmer', 'smoking', 'etc', 'Final', 'verdict', 'fun', 'movie', 'will', 'delight', 'inner', 'child', 'jaded', 'adult']",Fantastic Mr. Fox
