1444213,A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E,B0056OZI20,"Archie Mercer ""Archie""","[2, 2]","I took a shot on this one as I do love good westerns. And for the most part I can say I enjoyed the film. It tends to use a lot of western clich&eacute;s. For example, the good guy is a stranger who ends up helping a family in distress against huge odds, the bad guy tends to wear black and is pure evil. The good guys always hit what they shoot at, the bad guys usually JUST miss, and of course there is the preverbal saloon whore with a heart of gold who is in danger. Basic stuff to say the least. But there are a few twists as well. The sexy female gunslinger for one, played by Veronica Diaz, adds spice to the plot.The movie itself has a good flow and solid character development. Overall I enjoyed the film, at least until the final confrontation. At that point the film just got silly. It features a chase scene with the bad guy chasing a stagecoach with the good guy chasing him. Not quite sure what the bad guy has in mind as he's out of bullets and completely outnumbered. But instead of an explosive finale we get one that kind of fizzles. The movie ends with a quick 'feel-good' scene set two years in the future.Again, overall I liked the film as it has many of the qualities that make up a good western. I just wish the ending was better. I would recommend the film as a good escape flick for those nights where you have nothing better to do.",3,"Actually, not too bad until the end!",1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,1357,"['took', 'shot', 'one', 'do', 'love', 'good', 'westerns', 'most', 'part', 'can', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'use', 'lot', 'western', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.', 'example', 'good', 'guy', 'stranger', 'who', 'up', 'helping', 'family', 'distress', 'huge', 'odds', 'bad', 'guy', 'wear', 'black', 'pure', 'evil', 'good', 'guys', 'always', 'hit', 'what', 'shoot', 'bad', 'guys', 'usually', 'JUST', 'miss', 'course', 'preverbal', 'saloon', 'whore', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'danger', 'Basic', 'stuff', 'say', 'least', 'are', 'few', 'twists', 'as', 'well', 'sexy', 'female', 'gunslinger', 'one', 'played', 'Veronica', 'Diaz', 'spice', 'plot.The', 'movie', 'good', 'flow', 'solid', 'character', 'development', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'least', 'final', 'confrontation', 'point', 'film', 'just', 'got', 'silly', 'chase', 'scene', 'bad', 'guy', 'chasing', 'stagecoach', 'good', 'guy', 'chasing', 'Not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'bad', 'guy', 'mind', 'bullets', 'completely', 'outnumbered', 'instead', 'explosive', 'finale', 'get', 'one', 'kind', 'fizzles', 'movie', 'quick', ""'feel-good"", 'scene', 'set', 'two', 'years', 'future.Again', 'overall', 'liked', 'film', 'many', 'qualities', 'make', 'up', 'good', 'western', 'just', 'wish', 'ending', 'was', 'better', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'good', 'escape', 'flick', 'nights', 'where', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do']",Gundown

Travis McCain (Shockley) has taken over the town of Dead River and the people are living in fear. When Cole Brandt (Walker) comes in to town looking for revenge for the murderer of his wife and child he finds someone that needs to be taken care of. This is a movie where the plot and idea is much better then the movie was. While it had some really good scenes and action, it was just much, much to slow moving and hard to get into. The acting was not bad and it was decently made, it was just really tough to get into. If you are a hardcore western fan this till appeal to you, if you like an occasional one it would be better to go find a different one. Overall, not a bad movie just way to slow to fully keep you interested for the entire time. I give it a C-.Would I watch again? - I barely made it through once. No",2,"Another western where the plot and idea are better then the actual movie itself. Not bad just very, very slow.
