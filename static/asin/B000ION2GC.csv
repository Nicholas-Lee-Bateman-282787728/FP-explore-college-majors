They should maybe start thinking about retiring as well.  I think the lead singer would do very well if he went solo!,2,Not Bad....Not Real Good Either!,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,254,"['group', 'used', 'be', 'soooooo', 'good', 'Now', 'only', 'lead', 'singer', 'top', 'vocal', 'form', 'other', 'men', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'shown', 'up', 'should', 'maybe', 'start', 'thinking', 'about', 'retiring', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'lead', 'singer', 'would', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'went', 'solo']",N/A

That's too bad, because it's time for them to hang it up!  Not only are they out of tune, but they can't dance and their costumes were too ""colorful"" accompanied by flags and stars, to say the least -- they were awful!  I guess they need the money.  Also, not to embarrass anybody, but you'd think they'd get their teeth fixed with all the money they've made over the years.
