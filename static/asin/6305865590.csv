But I feel it would be boring to base a movie to the book. Why not try something new? What's the point in reading a book and watching a movie to be the same. I feel changes are good.I feel in some scenes they are too predictable. The pilot having a heart attack etc. But it's a good movie. Plenty of nice scenery and lovely animals.I would recommend this movie to anyone.",5,Great Movie!,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,520,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'am', 'huge', 'Jared', 'Rushton', 'fan', 'when', 'bought', 'movie', 'had', 'watch', 'it.First', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'base', 'movie', 'book', 'Why', 'not', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'What', 'point', 'reading', 'book', 'watching', 'movie', 'be', 'same', 'feel', 'changes', 'are', 'good.I', 'feel', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'predictable', 'pilot', 'having', 'heart', 'attack', 'etc', 'good', 'movie', 'Plenty', 'nice', 'scenery', 'lovely', 'animals.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone']",Cry in the Wild VHS

It had believable plots and really nice nature sceens.It is about a kid who's parents divorced and he is flying to Canada to visit his father.  During transit the pilot dies of a heart attack and the plan lands into a large lake in a mountainous region and sinks with all his belongings except the hatchet his mother gave him before he left on his trip.  This hatchet was attached to his belt, and it literally saves his life as he uses it remarkably to build shelter and the such. The movie illustrates how he had to survive off the land and to protect himself from preditors (not violent).  I do not really recall a lot of bad language or bloody sceens and the only time the kid is unclothed is when they show a glimpse of him diving into the water to bathe.

481242,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,6305865590,Eric S. Kim,"[3, 4]","Based on the novel, ""Hatchet,"" by Gary Paulsen, this film focuses on a young boy who finds himself in the middle of the Canadian wilderness after a plane crash. With very minimal equipment (his hatchet and Mother Nature), he must do all he can to survive in the wild before help arrives (if it ever does). A Cry in the Wild is basically a standard survival film, but it does have some beautiful scenery throughout. The production value is limited, so it does look very low-budget at times, but it's saved by some impressive camerawork. The minimal music sounds nice, and the film moves along nicely without being too slow or too quick. The performances are unfortunately lackluster: Jared Rushton gives a poor performance as the main character, but I give him credit for at least trying to act. Sue Martin and Meadows give average performances as the parents. Ned Beatty gives a slightly better performance, even if he only has five minutes of screen time.All in all, A Cry in the Wild is a beautiful-looking film. The natural scenery makes up for some wooden performances in the film. I would still recommend it as a guide on how to survive in the wild.Grade: 6.2 out of 10",3,"Beautiful-looking film, slightly marred by poor performances",1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,1174,"['Based', 'novel', 'Hatchet', 'Gary', 'Paulsen', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'middle', 'Canadian', 'wilderness', 'plane', 'crash', 'very', 'minimal', 'equipment', 'hatchet', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'must', 'do', 'can', 'survive', 'wild', 'help', 'arrives', 'ever', 'Cry', 'Wild', 'basically', 'standard', 'survival', 'film', 'have', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'production', 'value', 'limited', 'look', 'very', 'low-budget', 'times', 'saved', 'impressive', 'camerawork', 'minimal', 'music', 'nice', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'nicely', 'being', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'quick', 'performances', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'lackluster', 'Jared', 'Rushton', 'poor', 'performance', 'main', 'character', 'give', 'credit', 'least', 'trying', 'act', 'Sue', 'Martin', 'Meadows', 'give', 'average', 'performances', 'parents', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'slightly', 'better', 'performance', 'even', 'only', 'five', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time.All', 'A', 'Cry', 'Wild', 'beautiful-looking', 'film', 'natural', 'scenery', 'up', 'wooden', 'performances', 'film', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'guide', 'how', 'survive', 'wild.Grade', '6.2', '10']",Cry in the Wild VHS
