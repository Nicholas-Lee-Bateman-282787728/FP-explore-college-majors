It's not funny (although the creature-makeup looks like leftovers from ORCS), it's not scary (how can anybody compare it to DESCENT [like the German bluray-backcover does?) but it's boring... 5 not very likable 20-somethings are stranded on an remote island, there are noises in the trees... and halt-eaten carcasses. ok, reads like a dozen other shaky-cam snooze-fests from the last months. what sets it apart? nothing. dont buy, dont rent...dont even look at the cover while browsing at blockbuster's.",1,What a turd,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,515,"['Sorry', 'sux', 'not', 'funny', 'creature-makeup', 'looks', 'leftovers', 'ORCS', 'not', 'scary', 'how', 'can', 'anybody', 'compare', 'DESCENT', '[', 'German', 'bluray-backcover', 'boring', '5', 'not', 'very', 'likable', '20-somethings', 'are', 'stranded', 'remote', 'island', 'are', 'noises', 'trees', 'halt-eaten', 'carcasses', 'ok', 'dozen', 'other', 'shaky-cam', 'snooze-fests', 'last', 'months', 'what', 'apart', 'nothing', 'dont', 'buy', 'dont', 'rent', 'dont', 'even', 'look', 'cover', 'browsing', 'blockbuster']",N/A
1346770,A28Z84QTQ3ZLF3,B003IMGTGQ,a movie fan,"[0, 0]","So, the story is that this film was so disliked by the producers that they reshot it with an entirely different cast , probably setting a record for the shortest duration between original and remake.  That would make you think it must be one of the worst movies ever, but it wouldn't even make the bottom 1000 in just the DVD Delirium books. It's not that bad, despite a raggedy script, lapses in logic, and endlessly repeated visual tropes from other horror movies.  As always, Jewel Staite rises above the material so much it makes you wonder if her whole career isn't some kind of crime (except for Firefly and SG:Atlantis, which gave her something to work with).  She almost single-handedly makes the second half of the film (by far the better half) work.  The creatures are interesting, if owing a bit too much to Predator-like cosmetics.  The 10 minute making-of featurette is worth a view, as well.  Don't expect too much - it's just a popcorn movie - but I thought it was better than 99% of what Sci-Fi airs.  BTW, this was the original British title; the US title was supposed to be The Tribe, I think.The film is anamorphic widescreen but much of it is very dark (at night, in caves, etc);  I suspect that the smaller the screen, the worse it looks.

I'm not a huge fan of these types of movies, so it was tough for me to really get into this one.

1346773,A26CJ1WCN0RMUA,B003IMGTGQ,D. Karchmer,"[0, 0]","Ironic this was about a shipwreck, because that's exactly how I would describe it as a movie. The title was rather misleading, especially since 'they' came during the day as well. The movie spent way too much time on weak romantic character development and not enough time on suspense or scares - unless you are frightened by rustling leaves and shaking branches. Without the usual formula of naked women, gore, or scares to hold your attention, not sure what the intended purpose of this B-movie was. The whole thing seemed rushed, and frankly, I was in a hurry for it to be over as well.  The premise and appearance of the creatures ripped off Predator.
