He also happens to have a major crush on a classmate Mary Jane. One day on a field trip his class goes to a laboratory with genetic engineered ""superspiders"". As he's taking photographs of Mary Jane a ""superspider"" slides down the ceiling and bites Peter. He starts to feel sick and then goes to sleep. He doesn't wake up the same man he was when he fell asleep. From then on he becomes Spider-Man. The web-slinging life saving Spider-Man. Unfortunately, as always, there's a villain in town. There's where the Green Goblin comes in. Then Spiderman has to fight a battle between good and evil.I have never seen any of the Spider-Man comics. In fact, I'm not even a big fan of the cartoons. However, after just seeing the first movie, I wanted more and more of Spiderman. The Spiderman costume for is classic. His abilities are even better:clinging to walls, spraying webs of string from his hand, better jumping capabilities, more strength, faster reflexes, and the special Spidey Sense--which allows Peter to forsee things that are coming at him or coming for him.All of the scenes take place in New York City. During the film, there's a lot of good animation. Spider-Man swinging from building to building requires effects. I was very impressed with all of the effects. If you have seen the comics or just want to tryout a superhero film, I recommend Spider-Man.",5,"""And now...the amazing SPIDER-MAN!!!""",1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,1450,"['Tobey', 'McGuire', 'ordinary', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'who', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'nerd', 'also', 'have', 'major', 'crush', 'classmate', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'One', 'day', 'field', 'trip', 'class', 'laboratory', 'genetic', 'engineered', 'superspiders', 'taking', 'photographs', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'superspider', 'slides', 'down', 'ceiling', 'bites', 'Peter', 'feel', 'sick', 'then', 'sleep', ""n't"", 'wake', 'up', 'same', 'man', 'was', 'when', 'fell', 'asleep', 'then', 'Spider-Man', 'web-slinging', 'life', 'saving', 'Spider-Man', 'Unfortunately', 'always', 'villain', 'town', 'where', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Then', 'Spiderman', 'fight', 'battle', 'good', 'evil.I', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Spider-Man', 'comics', 'fact', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'big', 'fan', 'cartoons', 'However', 'just', 'seeing', 'first', 'movie', 'wanted', 'more', 'more', 'Spiderman', 'Spiderman', 'costume', 'classic', 'abilities', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'clinging', 'walls', 'spraying', 'webs', 'string', 'hand', 'better', 'jumping', 'capabilities', 'more', 'strength', 'faster', 'reflexes', 'special', 'Spidey', 'Sense', 'Peter', 'forsee', 'things', 'are', 'coming', 'coming', 'him.All', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'film', 'lot', 'good', 'animation', 'Spider-Man', 'swinging', 'building', 'building', 'effects', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'effects', 'have', 'seen', 'comics', 'just', 'want', 'tryout', 'superhero', 'film', 'recommend', 'Spider-Man']",N/A

It's a review of the box set: Spider-Man Limited Eidtion DVD Collector's Gift Set. (I'll do a review of the Spider-Man dvd at a later time) It contains two dvds: 1) the Spider-Man widescreen special edition, and while I'm not going to go into it in this review, it is a great movie and a great dvd; and 2) Stan Lee's Mutants, Monsters & Marvels, which I've reviewed under the dvd, so I won't go much into this dvd here. But it is a very informative interview. These two dvds pretty much make the gift set worth the price. It also comes with a few 'collector's items' which I leave to you to decide if they make it worth picking up the gift set or just buying the dvds. There's a reproduction of the Amazing Fantasy comic that first introduced Spider-Man. It's monetary value is null, since it is a reproduction, but it is nice to get a copy of our favorite web-slinger's first appearance. A bit juvenile, but valueable for the Spidey-fan. There's a piece of artwork by John Romita Sr, nice but doesn't add much to the set. And finally there is a film cell from the movie (when Spider-Man is dodging Goblin's bats in the burning building).

584845,A3ONKRWEZMJJUV,B00005JKCH,"Adrian Duran Sanchez ""Conductista""","[5, 8]","Spider man is mediocre film. Crappy direction, bad visual effects, cheesy emotions and Hollywood clich&eacute;s enhanced by an stupid script. Any serious consideration concerning the quality of its well manufactured commercial approach is completely absurd and futile. Don't mind the childish aspects of its whole concept, you won't need to use your brain through this movie (just the way you like it dear Spider Man Fan). Is it entertaining? Well yeah, but Jerry Springer is way more entertaining and way more stupid. Is it exiting like a roller coaster ride? Hell no! The action sequences are a constant routine, besides the script was to simplistic and superficial to let any of them turn into a real cliffhanger. Is the love story really compelling? Like a soap opera I would say, and just as bad. What about the villain? Well, Willem Dafoe is a great actor, but the Green Goblin thing was to over the top for him, so he is not to blame (the Green Goblin outfit seems like a big pajama with a helmet). And what about Tobey Mcguire as Peter Parker? His looks and performance really fit the character essence, but the film was so bad that it didn't matter, and Sam Raimi has to take all take all the blame for this. It's not his understanding of the characters and their world what he got wrong, but the choice of script and easy direction that pushed every emotive theme too heavy over the protagonist, making everything shallow and vulgar. With great Power comes great Responsibility! Is this line a joke? Hell yeah! Pure vacuity by definition.So, Peter Parker is a dump nerd trying hard to find his way in life. No body likes him, everybody mocks him, the girl he loves seems to close and away, not a penny in his pocket, and other minor dramas are drawn in his way to become a superhero. Plus, the tragic element enters his life when his beloved uncle dies, Mary Jane hooks up with his best friend, and the villain is born by another accident (who by the way, is the father of his best buddy), and suddenly: BANG! That is the plot.I suppose some credit has to be given to the treatment of Spidey's Origin; the rest of the movie is developed between predictable situations and corny adolescent weeps. But any kind of critical statements towards this film may end in a big: who gives a fu...! Its enormous box office success is enough to shut anyone's mouth. Now take also into consideration the DVD income, trigger happy studio executives and ecstatic  pseudo-artistic film makers won't be sad at all with bad reviews.The visual effects (made up by the already doubtful I.L.M.), resulted in an exposure of cheap muscular movements and bad body textures, too obvious to the be ignore by today's highly trained Spectator Eye (cause anything less the seemingless is not good enough). And of course, the jokes where deadly stupid.Good and accurate photography, an O.K. music score by Danny Elfman, nice editing and some ephemeral moments of decent narration (plus some dry kisses), made this flick a real taster's choice (that is if you are a fan of Gigli and those dump films that Jerry Bruckheimer so often loves to produce). Questions about; Why Kirsten Dunst was selected to play Mary Jane instead of a Hot Busty Blonde? Can never be answer. Mary Jane importance was all about that lousy wet T-shirt scene, the rest was about looking pretty (no acting incorporated).There are various versions available of the Spider Man movie on DVD (including a Limited Edition Collector's Gift Set), everyone comes with great Visual and Sound Quality, plus a generous number of special features about the making of this junk. The 3-Disk Deluxe Edition can be considered a less hurtful move to your pocket (Its better to give it as a gift than to own it).The problem with this kind of films is how easy they can look silly without ever touching their concept with seriousness, the concern is always about looking good in their outfits, the story and its treatment is secondary.And so, Comic Book adaptations have reached rock bottom.

584846,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005JKCH,A. Estes,"[0, 0]","First off, I have never read a Spider-man comic in my life, in fact, I never was into comics, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It delivers everything you would expect from any big-budget summer blockbuster. You get action, you get dazzling special effects and even a love story to boot. Sure, the movie is predictable, but that's what makes it so great. Sure, I like a lot of cynical films and most of my favorite movies don't have happy endings, but it's refreshing to see a movie that actually feels good to watch. Tobey Maguire is perfect in his roll as Peter Parker, a photography geek who is turned into Spider-man by way of a poisonous spider-bite. His love interest and next door neighbor is played by Kirsten Dunst. Both are perfect for the movie and do a really good job. Willem Dafoe was a great choice for Norman Osbourne (AKA The Green Goblin) to me, his character had the most dimension. Even though he was the bad guy, I didn't know how to feel towards him in the movie. At times he would be a caring father and five minutes later he would be an insane terrorist. The plot is very good, I don't know if it actually comes from the comic book, but I thought it was VERY well written and has plenty of plot twists to keep you awake. My only gripe about this film is the scene inside of the burning building where Spider-Man and the Green Goblin get into a fight [...]. If I had been behind the editing chair, that scene would have hit the cutting room floor [...]. But one tiny problem can't defeat an otherwise great movie. I suggest anyone goes to see it.

It has it all-great characters, great plot, great special effects and of coarse great sound editing! It is almost exactly like the comics/TV cartoons! In all probability one of the only differences are that... I'll let you know after you watch it (don't want to spoil it). This movie is worth watching! It's worth the wait that all Spider man fans have been waiting for. It's a film that's appealing to children, teenagers, and adults! I haven't met anyone who hates it! It has both romance and humor! Dunst and Maguire are perfect for the role! It's a movie that let's you know how wide an imagination of a director can be. It's a touching story and at the same time a fast action movie that you wouldn't mind watching over and over again! In a way it's like the comic book coming alive! It's for all Lord of the rings-Harry Potter-The matrix- and Batman fans!It's fundamentally concentrates on Peter Parker-a guy who's in love with Mary Jane. It's a kind of movie that Alanis Morissette songs would really go with since she has songs to support all the moods that you'd feel as you watch Spider-Man (and hey she has a song called Mary Jane!).Overall it was really worth the wait. It's better than any movie I've watched all summer! The movie packs together a lot of excitement. Just like Lord of the rings it's touching and at the same time exciting (I know I've mentioned this before!). No one could have made it any better than Raimi (although I'd like to watch a movie directed by Peter Jackson and Raimi). Spider-man is no old super hero movie (although it does have a damsel who is constantly in distress)-it's a modernized fast creation that could only be imagined as you read the comic books-until now! It's an impressive flick that you should watch if you haven't watched it yet! It's a movie that very rarely bores you.

Almost everyone can somehow relate to the struggles that Peter Parker faces. Most of us can associate with feeling like you are living a dual-life. And besides, just how cool would it be to be able to crawl up walls and shoot webs from our hands.Another reason is that ""Spider-Man"" almost faithfully adapts the story of our hero from the small pages to the big screen. There are minor changes, but nothing that alters what the story is about or who the characters are.Yet another reason is because of the terrific action in the movie. The CGI and special effects in the action sequences were nothing short of amazing.And still another reason is the romance in the movie. It made it easier for the guys to ask their girls to go watch the movie with them.""Spider-Man"" is, without a doubt, one of the best movies of all time. Despite initial concerns, Tobey Maguire is very convincing as our conflicted hero. Kirstin Dunst, as always, was excellent, and casting William DaFoe as the Green Goblin was nothing short of brilliant.This DVD edition comes packed with hours of extra, much of which most people won't care about.

584852,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,B00005JKCH,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[1, 1]","Even though I am not a comic book-based movie fan, I really enjoyed Sam Raimi's fun and reverent adaptation of Stan Lee's web-spinning, wall-crawling Spider-Man.I have to admit that I did not see this movie in my local cinema.  At the time I was saving my limited movie-going funds for Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, which opened two weeks after Spider-Man.  I was also leery of having to pay to see a comic-book movie adaptation. I had loved the first two Superman movies, missed the third entirely until it came on TV (and hated it), saw the laughable Superman IV turkey, then had been further disappointed by the Batman franchise.  I did see the 2000 X-Men feature  film, but only because my best friend Rogers loaned me his DVD.Even so, the critical reviews on Time and elsewhere had given Spider-Man a pretty good ""buzz,"" so when another friend asked me what I wanted for the holidays, so I requested the Wide-screen Special Edition.My friends, this movie and its DVD version do not disappoint!  Like Richard Donner did in the first Superman feature film, director Sam Raimi gives us a reverent ""origins of' story that fairly captures Stan Lee's original storyline.The screenplay by David (Jurassic Park) Koepp introduces us to Peter Parker, a nerdy high school senior who is not very popular.  As played by Tobey (Pleasantville) Maguire, Peter represents the vast majority of teenage boys who excel academically yet, because they aren't socially skilled or good looking, are teased or even ostracized by their fellow students.  If you watch the opening scene where Peter has to run after the school bus, you'll understand.Spider-Man is really the intertwined tale of the origins of both Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, a.k.a. Norman Osborn.  As played by the talented Willem (Platoon) Dafoe, Osborne is a charismatic yet ambitious scientist who wants to get a military contract for a ""super soldier.""  With a physical enhancement formula, a technically advanced armored suit, and a neat-o powered glider, this super soldier will, hopefully, give Osborn's OsCorp billions in funding, and establish Norman as a visionary entrepreneur.However, this being a comic book adaptation, is a recipe for disaster.  When one of his top scientists warns Norman that the formula needs to be researched further (which would mean missing the Pentagon's deadline for bids) and warns of really nasty side effects, Osborn decides to test the formula on himself.  And before you can say Dr. Jekyll, poor Norman - as the soon-to-be-departed scientific naysayer predicted - goes suddenly and tragically insane.Meanwhile, while on a field trip to Columbia University, Peter Parker has his own rendezvous with destiny with a genetically altered super-spider.  (This is just one of a few ""re-imaginings"" of the original Spider-Man concept.  In the comic book premiere issue of 1962, the spider had been affected by radiation - a dark little allusion to the then prevalent threat of nuclear war.  There are other revisions...more on those later.)Although I am not an expert on Spider-Man - nor any comic book superhero, for that matter - the movie is faithful to its sources.  Spider-Man (like DC's Batman) becomes a crime-fighter when crime touches his family.  In Peter's case, his motivation is the senseless death of his uncle (in the movie, by a robber who car jacks Ben Parker after taking the money from a cheapskate wrestling ring operator). Not only does Peter seek revenge for his uncle's murder, but he also feels responsible: When Peter has a chance to at least call the police to report the robbery at the wrestling entrepreneur's office, he doesn't do so because he was not paid the promised prize money.The rest of the story revolves around two plots: Spidey's clashes with the Green Goblin and his relationships with  Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (Peter Franco), who is Norman's son and, according to the legend of Spider-Man, destined to become the web-weaver's nemesis, the Hobgoblin.  In this, what seems to be the first of a hopefully successful franchise, the seeds of conflict are planted in two ways.  First, Peter and Harry, who start the film as best friends, compete for M.J's affections.  Second, Harry will, by movie's end, come to hate Spider-Man with a passion.The film, like most adaptations of novels or comics, does tweak certain things to fit into contemporary culture or for dramatic reasons.  Spidey's webs, originally designed by Peter and incorporated into his costume, now are organic mutations.  The fine spidery hairs that form on his hands and fingers to grip walls and surfaces are also new inventions, as are the changes in the timeline (in the movie, Peter and his fellow teens are graduating seniors, where in the comic they were underclassmen).  Nevertheless, this movie, like Warner Bros.' 1978 Superman: The Movie, are fine examples of how a comic book hero can make the transition from the printed page to the silver screen.The DVD is chock-full of extra features, including two commentaries on the feature film disc, branching ""Web-I-sodes,"" TV and theatrical trailers, and exciting DVD-Rom features (such as Record Your Own Commentary).Even if you are not a big fan of comic book movies, this is a good movie to own.",5,A Stunning First Spider-Feature,1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,5283,"['Even', 'am', 'not', 'comic',

584854,A10WCSGF78M2KE,B00005JKCH,Alfonso A.,"[11, 13]","Since the sequel is already in the works, a review of ""Spider-Man"" almost seems superfluous. But it definitely isn't. Because, when a comic-book movie gets it right, as this one does, people should know, especially those who think of going to a big over-hyped summer blockbuster about as often as they think about going to the South Pole.This is a film, of course, in which a guy slings webs, scales walls and fights a villain who looks like a cross between the Joker and the grille of a Dodge Ram. But much like Peter Jackson and the initial ""Lord of the Rings"" movie, director Sam Raimi gets Spider-Man; he's been smitten with Spidey since he was a kid. (For his 12th birthday,we're told, his mom painted a Spider-Man mural on his bedroom wall.)To Raimi, making Spider-Man isn't interchangeable with making ""The Scorpion King"" or ""Men In Black II"" or any other big-budgeted summer movie. That fan's pure devotion coupled with Raimi's considerable directorial flair (remember the ""Evil Dead"" movies or ""A Simple Plan""?) makes the movie far better than you might expect.For anyone who hasn't been reading Marvel Comics since the early '60s (when Stan Lee created the character), Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a teen geek who lives in Queens with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris). Peter's the kind of guy who gets kicked around by the other kids for no particular reason, the kind of guy with a hopeless crush on the girl next door, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst, with flame-red hair).On a school field trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically mutated spider. The next morning, he no longer needs his glasses; his abs look like they were carved out of The Rock. He soon discovers he has other powers, too: He can crawl up walls and spin webs that make leaping over tall buildings in a single bound uneccessary. He simply swings though Manhattan's concrete canyons. (Special effects evaluation: very, very good but not always thrilling.)When tragedy strikes his family, Peter stops fooling around with his new powers and starts fighting crime. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the tycoon dad of Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco who played James Dean on TV), is experiencing a super-power make-over, too. In a Jekyll -and- Hyde scenario, the good Osborn turns into the bad Green Goblin, who cruises around on a glider wreaking havoc and trying to destroy Spider-Man.Okay, it's not Tolstoy. It's not even Tolkien. But it is a picture jam-packed with swinging action scenes, spiffy spider jokes and an unforced earnestness that never becoes corny or tongue-in-cheek. ""Spider-Man"" doesn't go for the retro-camp of ""Dick Tracy"" or the brooding hipness of ""Batman."" True, the Spidey/Green Goblin battles are generic and somewhat repetitive, which can make the movie feel long. But the picture has an an energy and a self-confidence that give it a terrific movie-movie feel.Even the acting is better than it usually is in this kind of flick. Dafoe brings some of his downtown theater training to his role, especially in the scenes where the innocent Osborn is talking with his evil alter identity. (at one point, he chats with The Green Goblin's mask which hangs from a wing-back chair.) Dunst, whose work in the current ""The Cat's Meow"" proves she doesn't have anything to prove to anyone, puts some spunk and integrity in her admittedly limited role.Still, it all comes down to Maguire who is flat-out terrific. A lot of fuss surrounded his casting: what's the sensitive kid from ""The Ice Storm"" and ""The Cider House Rules"" doing as a beloved comic-book hero? But Raimi said that he didn't need to look for Spider-Man; he needed to find Peter Parker. Maguire, with his slightly crooked grin, his mild yet laser-sharp gaze and his crackly, choked-up voice turns out to be the perfect choice. He knows we root for poor, shy Peter as much as we do for Spidey in all his wall-crawling splendor. Maguire brings a pensiveness to the part as well a goofy likability and an unabashed intelligence. When things get totally outlandish, he's our touchstone.The best advice Uncle Ben gives to his nephew is ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Sam Raimi knows exactly what that means.",4,Spider-Mania,1022803200,"05 31, 2002",2002,4217,"['sequel', 'already', 'works', 'review', 'Spider-Man', 'almost', 'superfluous', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'when', 'comic-book', 'movie', 'right', 'one', 'people', 'should', 'know', 'especially', 'who', 'think', 'going', 'big', 'over-hyped', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'as', 'often', 'think', 'going', 'South', 'Pole.This', 'film', 'course', 'guy', 'slings', 'webs', 'scales', 'walls', 'fights', 'villain', 'who', 'cross', 'Joker', 'grille', 'Dodge', 'Ram', 'much', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'initial', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movie', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'been', 'smitten', 'Spidey', 'was', 'kid', '12th', 'birthday', ""'re"", 'told', 'mom', 'painted', 'Spider-Man', 'mural', 'bedroom', 'wall', 'Raimi', 'making', 'Spider-Man', ""n't"", 'interchangeable', 'making', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'other', 'big-budgeted', 'summer', 'movie', 'fan', 'pure', 'devotion', 'coupled', 'Raimi', 'considerable', 'directorial', 'flair', 'remember', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'movies', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'might', 'expect.For', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'reading', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'early', ""'60s"", 'when', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'created', 'character', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'teen', 'geek', 'who', 'Queens', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Peter', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'kicked', 'other', 'kids', 'particular', 'reason', 'kind', 'guy', 'hopeless', 'crush', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'flame-red', 'hair', 'school', 'field', 'trip', 'Peter', 'bitten', 'genetically', 'mutated', 'spider', 'next', 'morning', 'no', 'longer', 'glasses', 'abs', 'look', 'were', 'carved', 'Rock', 'soon', 'other', 'powers', 'too', 'can', 'crawl', 'up', 'walls', 'spin', 'webs', 'make', 'leaping', 'tall', 'buildings', 'single', 'bound', 'uneccessary', 'simply', 'swings', 'Manhattan', 'concrete', 'canyons', 'Special', 'effects', 'evaluation', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'always', 'thrilling', 'When', 'tragedy', 'family', 'Peter', 'fooling', 'around', 'new', 'powers', 'fighting', 'crime', 'Meanwhile', 'Norman', 'Osborn', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'tycoon', 'dad', 'Peter', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'played', 'James', 'Dean', 'TV', 'experiencing', 'super-power', 'make-over', 'too', 'Jekyll', '-and-', 'Hyde', 'scenario', 'good', 'Osborn', 'bad', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'who', 'around', 'glider', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'trying', 'destroy', 'Spider-Man.Okay', 'not', 'Tolstoy', 'not', 'even', 'Tolkien', 'picture', 'jam-packed', 'swinging', 'action', 'scenes', 'spiffy', 'spider', 'jokes', 'unforced', 'earnestness', 'never', 'corny', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'Spider-Man', ""n't"", 'go', 'retro-camp', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'brooding', 'hipness', 'Batman', 'True', 'Spidey/Green', 'Goblin', 'battles', 'are', 'generic', 'somewhat', 'repetitive', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'feel', 'long', 'picture', 'energy', 'self-confidence', 'give', 'terrific', 'movie-movie', 'feel.Even', 'acting', 'better', 'usually', 'kind', 'flick', 'Dafoe', 'downtown', 'theater', 'training', 'role', 'especially', 'scenes', 'where', 'innocent', 'Osborn', 'talking', 'evil', 'alter', 'identity', 'one', 'point', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'mask', 'wing-back', 'chair', 'Dunst', 'work', 'current', 'Cat', 'Meow', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'prove', 'anyone', 'spunk', 'integrity', 'admittedly', 'limited', 'role.Still', 'down', 'Maguire', 'who', 'flat-out', 'terrific', 'lot', 'fuss', 'surrounded', 'casting', 'what', 'sensitive', 'kid', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'doing', 'beloved', 'comic-book', 'hero', 'Raimi', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'look', 'Spider-Man', 'needed', 'find', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Maguire', 'slightly', 'crooked', 'grin', 'mild', 'yet', 'laser-sharp', 'gaze', 'crackly', 'choked-up', 'voice', 'out', 'be', 'perfect', 'choice', 'root', 'poor', 'shy', 'Peter', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'Spidey', 'wall-crawling', 'splendor', 'Maguire', 'pensiveness', 'part', 'as', 'well', 'goofy', 'likability', 'unabashed', 'intelligence', 'When', 'things', 'get', 'totally', 'outlandish', 'touchstone.The', 'best', 'advice', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'nephew', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'exactly', 'what']",N/A

Indeed, the action sequences and the special effects rank at the top (for people who complained that the CGI looks cartoon-ish, please refer to the ""article"" the film was based on.) At time it even seem far too graphic for younger viewers, though audiences would not expect anything less from the director of ""Evil Dead"".For just any pop-corn movie, I would've shrouded mu shoulders and say, ""It was a good ride while it lasted"". But this is a film which was suppose to define the vision of the original superhero. With it's history, a more engrossing or engaging characters development should shine as bright as the actions. the problem is, they don't. When Spiderman is walking around without his mask on or nor revealing his super power, the film comes to a stall. We see wooden boxes stacked together being blown around by wind instead of actors. Maguire is dull, and Dunst is just awkward. Their love scene together not only generate no chemistry or heat, the lines are equally laughable, if not put most of the audience to sleep. The infamous spider-kiss (where Spiderman was hanging upside-down tounging Mary-Jane) is anything but sexy, instead, it looked dirty, even disturbing. In fact, the only person in the film who actually deliver an adequate performance is Willem Dafoe's menancing overacting.Production-wise, it surely deserve more stars.

Helmed by one of my favorite directors in Sam Raimi(whom also wrote and directed the Evil Dead films; check them out), Spider-Man makes for a great movie.Tobey Maguire is genius casting. In the lead role, Maguire lets you empathize and sympathize with Peter Parker, which is missing from many other comic-based films. Willem Dafoe chews up the scenery as Norman Osborn AKA the Green Goblin. He makes for a great adversary. Stuck in the middle are Kirston Dunst(Mary Jane, the main girl in Peter's life) and James Franco(Harry Osborn, son of Norman and Peter's best friend), both of whom provide great supporting parts.What makes Spider-Man succeed, is that the script(Well written by David Koepp) and Raimi's touch take the time to develop the characters and make you actually care about them. (Not too many comic-movies can make that claim) They're layered, so that when they cry, you cry with them. Not that this film is nothing but sappy, there's plenty of action to satisfy popcorn nuts. Some may complain that CGI Spider-Man doesn't look real, but I thought it looked just fine.Everything about this movie is top-notch, and there's only more to love with the DVD, considering the huge load of extras.

I thought the special effects and the costumes were all well done.  The acting was good and the story basically made sense (although there were a couple of coincidences that were a bit hard to take).  This movie is definitely worth watching.On the negative side I felt that it lacked the super ""Blockbuster"" appeal that certain movies have that make them watchable over and over again.  I am not sure that I can pin point why that is but I can make a few guesses:The villain was too ""convenient"" (who he is and the timing are too coincidental) and he didn't have any evil cohorts.  The acting by Dafoe was excellent but the situations he was in and the surrounding story line just weren't as strong.The transition from normal Peter Parker into Spider-man was a bit forced and making all the time frames work was obviously a problem.  This is also why the timing between the good and bad characters and how they meet was awkward.  Perhaps the film should have started with Spider-man being around for a long time already and simply just fighting evil.  Then Spider-man II could have been made showing the touching and romantic part of his growing up, the high school sweetheart part of the story, etc.  In X-men we just got Wolverine in action, right off the bat, and it plays better.

584860,A2HGET34VBQPIK,B00005JKCH,"Amazon Customer ""starscroll""","[2, 2]","Firstly, let me say that I think Tobey Maguire was a great choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman. He also seemed to play the typical boy next door better than Kirsten Dunst's typical girl next door. The first costume Peter comes up with for his costume is just hilarious...you'll know what I mean when you see it but the actual costume you see him in for the majority of the movie was just fantastic. Apparently they had to sew him into his costume since the seams kept on ripping - not at all surprising when you see just how agile he had to be in the role of superhero.I had not followed the comics or cartoons but found the story very easy to follow. At times I actually anticipated where the story was going, like what happened with Peter's uncle and when the Green Gobulin tricks Spiderman into saving him. I also enjoyed the scene on the rooftop when Peter first tries to use his webbing on command, when he first climbs a wall and his aunt's comment ""You're not Superman, you know"".One major downfall was the obvious use of computer animation in scenes such as where Spiderman is pursuing the criminal in the car. It's disappointing because the CGI is detectable but it would be so hard to do that kind of stunt work using real people with speed, realism and acrobatics. I remember thinking that it was looking more and more like a game or something. Most noticable on the big screen I predict that it will be less of a problem when watching at home on DVD.William Dafoe seemed to play his duel role with particular relish and I think that the scenes involving the glider would have been quite fun. The scene he does in front of the mirror  was quite clever I thought.It's also easy to see how they they are planning to do a sequel to the movie since the storyline was already written into the story.",4,From great power comes great responsibility!,1023753600,"06 11, 2002",2002,1803,"['Firstly', 'let', 'say', 'think', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spiderman', 'also', 'seemed', 'play', 'typical', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'better', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'typical', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'first', 'costume', 'Peter', 'up', 'costume', 'just', 'hilarious', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'see', 'actual', 'costume', 'see', 'majority', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'fantastic', 'Apparently', 'had', 'sew', 'costume', 'seams', 'kept', 'ripping', 'not', 'surprising', 'when', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'agile', 'had', 'be', 'role', 'superhero.I', 'had', 'not', 'followed', 'comics', 'cartoons', 'found', 'story', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'times', 'actually', 'anticipated', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'happened', 'Peter', 'uncle', 'when', 'Green', 'Gobulin', 'Spiderman', 'saving', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'scene', 'rooftop', 'when', 'Peter', 'first', 'use', 'webbing', 'command', 'when', 'first', 'wall', 'aunt', 'comment', ""'re"", 'not', 'Superman', 'know', '.One', 'major', 'downfall', 'was', 'obvious', 'use', 'computer', 'animation', 'scenes', 'such', 'where', 'Spiderman', 'pursuing', 'criminal', 'car', 'disappointing', 'CGI', 'detectable', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'hard', 'do', 'kind', 'stunt', 'work', 'using', 'real', 'people', 'speed', 'realism', 'acrobatics', 'remember', 'thinking', 'was', 'looking', 'more', 'more', 'game', 'something', 'Most', 'noticable', 'big', 'screen', 'predict', 'will', 'be', 'less', 'problem', 'when', 'watching', 'home', 'DVD.William', 'Dafoe', 'seemed', 'play', 'duel', 'role', 'particular', 'relish', 'think', 'scenes', 'involving', 'glider', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'fun', 'scene', 'front', 'mirror', 'was', 'quite', 'clever', 'thought.It', 'also', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'are', 'planning', 'do', 'sequel', 'movie', 'storyline', 'was', 'already', 'written', 'story']",N/A

584863,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,B00005JKCH,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[2, 2]","This, the first of the theatrical Spidermen movies was a colossal hit for the time period. Almost every actor cast did a wonderful job, save for JK Simmons, and his over the top portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson. Thank goodness he was used only sparingly. Nevertheless, this movie really hit the spot for me. Cliff Robertson was fantastic, as were all of the other supporting characters, save for perhaps Dunst. Yet that was not her fault as she was given little to work with in this movie. All she did was scream. I kid you not; she was in three situations of extreme danger within the space of only a month of movie time! Get real! The festival at Times Square, the attempted gang rape by tough thugs and last but not least the kidnapping by Green Goblin. That was too many times. The second time was contrived and written in just to exhibit Kirsten Dunst's voluptuous figure in a wet T-shirt. That scene should have been edited out.Comparing and contrasting the two films is fairly straightforward. The 2002 Spiderman was sheer comic book action showcasing a superhero recently endowed with his powers fighting a mad scientist bent on destruction whilst saving the damsel in distress. Peter Parker's parents are never alluded to, and while this kept the action centered in/on the story, it left us wondering about his backstory. Without offending the great Martin Sheen, I liked Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben the best of the two. The same goes with Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. She looks and feels more like ""Aunt May"" than Sally Field. Field is 20 years younger than Harris is and thus there is a 10 year difference in their characters' ages (2002/2012). The scenes with him and his Uncle Ben are very dramatic and emotional. I liked them greatly for their depth of emotion.The Amazing Spiderman with Andrew Garfield was a more in-depth movie. The subplot with Peter's parents disappearing gave us food for thought, as did the very end of that movie where The Lizard converses with a mysterious (Osborn?) man. The acting was just as good and I liked the romance between Parker and the cop's daughter more than I did the love triangle that existed with Maguire, Franco and Dunst. I can't understand how friends would let themselves get placed in that position, especially since Franco's character could have had (Attracted) any girl (Better Looking Girls Too) with his Dad's money!In a nutshell, I loved both movies, but the characterizations were the best in the 2002 movie (Save For J. Jonah Jameson). The reason I give Spiderman Four Stars is because of the writer's penchant to place Mary Jane Watson in too many dangerous situations. Come on guys, we are in the 21st century, women don't scream like Fay Wray anymore! To me it was unseemly, not to mention extremely unlikely for a single woman to be walking down dark streets in New York City in this day and age! No way would that happen in any big American city!Despite its few faults, this movie was a technical masterpiece and brought back Spiderman to the masses after decades of waiting since Nicholas Hammond last played Spiderman (He Too Was Pretty Good For His Time Period).A.

I think Andrew Garfield summed it up best when he was asked about his role in this years `The Amazing Spider-Man'.  I mean, what little boy doesn't dream about being Spider-Man?  Sam Raimi's vision of Spider-Man's origin is inspired yet respectful of the comic series and really lends itself to being immortalized as one of the better superhero movies in recent memory.  It tackles Peter Parker's progression from boy to man really well, and while it doesn't have the same emotional weight as the second installment did (probably the best superhero movie of the aughts), it manages to build a solid foundation for what was to come.  Maguire is perfect for the role (seriously, the best Peter Parker imaginable) and the rest of the cast also fits very well into their respective roles, with Dafoe effectively evil (the man is just scary to look at) and the divine Kirsten Dunst making a memorable Mary Jane.  The special effects are solid, the action is intense and the progression of story takes centerfold in a very respectable way.

I was blown away by this film.  The story was great, and the effects were stunning.  I knew enough about Spider-Man's history to know that Sam Raimi didn't screw this film up.  I originally thought that Tobey Maguire, as most people have agreed with, was wrong for the part, until I learned that Spider-Man was a nerdy kid to begin with.  After I saw the movie, I realized that Maguire can play a wide spectrum of characters, and his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man was great.  Kirsten Dunst was, I thought, good in most ways, but she seemed a little prone to changing her personality.  Willem Dafoe was the best, though.  He perfectly played Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, with the scenes where he's arguing with himself very believable.  He was very creepy, and that made the movie even better.  The only thing that I would have liked to have seen were more fights between Spidy and Gobby.  Altogether, this was an amazing film.P.S.After 9/11, a scene was removed with a giant spider-web between the World Trade Center towers.

Like those movies, ""Spider-Man"" has a well chosen cast (especially Willem Dafoe, who very nearly steals the show as The Green Goblin), dazzling special effects, great direction and a well written script. Some elements I thought were a little convoluted, but overall it was a very good plot. The film's sets were cool as well, very expressionistic. I'm kind of surprised it didn't get any awards.

But the movie Spider-Man flowed pretty smoothly, and it had great effects that really captured the audience.There were a few things I have to mention, though. Peter (Tobey Maguire) was getting irritated that his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who was also his guardian, was being too fatherly toward him, to the point that Ben said, ""I'm not your father"" and Peter replied, ""Then stop acting like it!"" It made it sound as though later in the movie we'd find out what happened to Peter's father, but we never do. Also, when Peter accepts the last-a-few-minutes-in-the-ring-with-the-champ challenge at the wrestling arena, he beats up the champ pretty quickly, and when he goes to the manager to collect his cash prize, he is only given a percentage of it because he didn't stay in the ring for the allocated time. He tries arguing with the manager without much luck. Why didn't he just beat him up for the money? He just beat up the champ, didn't he?The end of the movie was also unsettling, even though that's what had to happen (you have to see the entire movie to understand what I mean). And by the way, there was one scene in the movie that really drove the point home that if a bully beats up a nerd, it's funny, but if it's the other way around, it's mean. Why IS that, anyway?

So many legal setbacks forced Spider-man to bounce from rights holder to rights holder before finally finding a place with Sony to deliver the goods.The hype surrounding this movie was astounding. I remember getting my copy of the soundtrack before the movie came out, and not just that, but also a copy of the ""Hero"" single by Nickelback as well. Seeing Spidey swinging over a gold-bathed New York on its cover got me even more stoked for this film.And so, opening night, I went with my dad to check the movie out, my heart pounding with excitement, the previews before the movie taking excruciatingly long.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), geek extraordinaire, gets bitten by a radioactive ""super spider"" while on a class fieldtrip as he tries to get a picture for the school paper of next-door-neighbour-slash-love-of-his-life Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Following a bout of sickness, Peter wakes up the next morning no longer a skinny geek but instead buff and tough, wondering what happened to him. Adding to the weirdness, he's suddenly able to do things he wasn't able to do before: no need for glasses; lots of energy; fantastic agility; amazing strength; sticks to walls; shoots sticky white web-things out of his wrists; can sense bad things before they happen. So, like any good teenager with superpowers, he uses them to impress the girl of his dreams, in his case taking on a spider-like persona in a wrestling match to win some big money to buy a car. While on the way there, he fights with his uncle, Ben, and leaves in a huff, only to later find out the burglar he let get away--who had stolen from the wrestling folks who didn't pay him what he was worth--killed his uncle in an effort to swipe a getaway car.Also going on, Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is having trouble with his company and so, in a fit to prove to the military his superhuman formula works so he can sell it to them, he tries it on himself . . . but with dire side effects: the creation of an alternate personality which is eventually dubbed ""the Green Goblin."" When things go sour for the company, the board of directors votes him out and Norman goes into full villain mode to exact his revenge.Across the city, Peter has learned that with great power comes great responsibility and so avenges his uncle's death by using his new spider-like powers for good and becomes the Amazing Spider-man.It's hero versus villain, Spider-man versus the Green Goblin, in this superheroic slugfest/love story/coming-of-age movie that made the wait for this flick well worth it.To be honest, however, the crazy overhype of this movie did put a damper on it for me when I first saw it. Straight up: when I left the theatre opening night I left disappointed. No that I thought it was awful, not by any means, it was just there was this lingering ""Is that it?"" feeling that hung over me as I made my way back to the car.If anything, Spider-man is definitely an origin movie, something to set the stage for more to come, giving a rich back story and atmosphere not to just Peter Parker's world, but to each of the supporting characters, even J. Jonah Jameson (who J.K. Simmons played brilliantly, by the way).The effects were top notch save for a couple moments where you clearly saw the Peter that was swinging and jumping from rooftop to rooftop was animated. Speaking of the swinging, when Spidey took you up and down through the deep concrete chasms of New York--man, you felt like you were there, swinging along with him. I heard they even developed a ""spider-cam"" for this movie. Cool. And that heartbreaking scene at the end where Peter turns down MJ? My heart bled for the guy.Do I stand by Spider-man? Absolutely. I saw it again in the theatre, going back with the mindset of ""seeing it for what it was,"" and I adored it afterward. Out of the three movies in this series so far, it's my second favorite. As for my favorite-favorite, just watch my reviews.This was a superhero movie done right, done well and done just plain cool.Recommended.A.P.

For what it is, it's just that good.Okay, I can hear a couple of criticisms to such (seemingly!) ridiculous hyperbole, so I'll take a shot at answering them.#1: ""It's a friggin' super-hero movie!""And your point is...? That's like saying The Searchers is a friggin' Western, or that 2001 is a friggin' sci-fi flick. Guys, I'm gonna say this one more time: quality IS NOT a function of genre. Just because an artist chooses to work within a given generic framework does not mean he doesn't have anything to say. Not all the great filmmakers have unpronounceable names or have been dead for 20-plus years (many of them have, but that's a subject for another review).#2: ""It's a friggin' soap opera!""Sure it is. So's the book of Genesis. So are many of Shakespeare's plays. As one of Spidey's co-creators used to put it, ""Nuff said"".****Listen, here's what I know. Spider-Man is, hands down, the best super-hero movie I've ever seen, both in terms of faithfulness to its source material and simply as a piece of cinema. It is, for lack of a better (or more appropriate) way of describing it, like BEING INSIDE OF a super-hero comic, which, fine films that they are, is more than I can say of either Tim Burton's Batman or Bryan Singer's X-Men. It's one of the best sf/fantasy films I've ever seen in my life. Hell, it's one of the best films I've seen in the last ten years, of ANY kind (and I've seen A LOT of films in the last ten years).

A film based on a superhero is hard as well. It worked for ""Superman"" and for ""Batman"", and now, it has worked for Spider-Man. To be perfectly honest with you, I was never a Spider-Man fan. I really didn't know anything about the character or the history or any other characters. It certainly was nice going into this movie to realize that you don't need to know anything to get into it. It's all pretty much laid out for you and you don't need to be a rabid fan or Spider-Man junkie to figure anything out. Tobey Maguire plays dorky Peter Parker. A nerd who's just kind of there. During a class field trip, Peter is bitten by a mysterious new species of spider. By the next morning, Peter has gone through some kind of metamorphosis. He doesn't need his glasses and his body has gotten more muscular. The spider bite has given him spider like abilities and super strength. Things go badly when there is a family accident, and Peter then knows right then and there that he has to use his new abilities and help people. Enter rich businessman Norman Osborn(Willem Dafoe),who is the father of Peter's best friend. Osborn has gone through a change himself. He masquerades as The Green Goblin, and soon becomes Spider-Man's arch nemesis. Through all of this chaos, one thing stays constant - Peter's love for the beautiful Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). Director Sam Raimi is known for smaller films like the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, as well as ""The Gift"", ""A Simple Plan"", and others. Some wondered if he had the stuff to handle such a big, epic film. Oh yes, he does. He does the job perfectly. It also doesn't hurt when you got a great cast doing good work. Maguire passes for Spider-Man, but he's far more interesting and intriguing as Peter Parker. Peter has real character. Something to play with. As Spider-Man, Maguire gets to do fancy stuff and wear a cool costume, but all of the character and charm that Maguire gives us as Peter, quickly goes away once he puts the costume on. Willem Dafoe is a great actor. I think everyone knows that. He really makes Norman Osborn a creepy fellow, even before he turns bad. Like Spider-Man, he loses character when he's The Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst is well cast as Mary Jane. She has the sweet, pretty girl next door thing down that would make anyone wish she had lived next door to them when they were young. I don't think she has ever looked as beautiful and radiant as she does here. The rest of the cast includes film veteran Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and a small cameo by the great Bruce Campbell. The movie goes by at a pretty nice pace. It's never boring or slow. It keeps going and it's a fun ride. Pure popcorn entertainment. The only problem I had with the movie were the special effects. Yes, they were fun and really took you for a ride, but I couldn't get over the fact of how faked it looked. That's really disappointing. With a movie like this and with the way effects and everything are nowadays, fake looking special effects are the last thing you would think a movie would have. Especially a movie like this. It makes one scratch their head. The movie would of been so much better if the effects were more realistic. It's been done hundreds of times. I've seen it. What's the deal Sam Raimi?. All in all, this is a colorful and fun ride for everyone to enjoy. It joins the rank as good superhero films. It's not in the 'great' catgory like ""Superman"" and ""Batman"", but it did what it was supposed to do and it was a lot of fun. Check this film out.

584883,A351XMJF8DCD8Z,B00005JKCH,"bart ""wwfrockfan""","[1, 1]","Without any doubt, Spiderman is easily known to be the best movie of 2002.  It is the second MARVEL movie made this century (With X-men being the 1st) and has more sequels to come.  It is also the best MARVEL movie so far, Daredevil sadly didn't turn out to be as good as this.  It has a good plot and great action scenes.  Although things don't go the same way in this movie as they did in the Comic books, it is still a fun Spiderman story to watch.  Tobey Maguire did a great job as Peter Parker/Spiderman especially when it comes changing from a nerd to a guy who will beat possibly anybody up and be fearless.  This movie had great acting.  Even this special edition DVD it comes on is great.  It is packed with 2 disks and a lot of neat x-tra stuff.  Here is the movie's plot.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is probably known to be the biggest loser in school.  He has only one friend named Harry Osborn (James Franko) and has had the biggest crush on a girl named Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst) in which he has had since like the first grade.  Anyway on a school field trip to a laboratory that studies spider the scientists have created spiders which has some sort genetic gene from three other different spiders put in it so it can became a ""super Spider"".  One of the Spiders escapes and goes ""wandering"" around in the lab.  It eventually goes on to Peter's hand and gives him a big bite, OUCH!!  At first Peter feels fine, but later things feel different.  Also, Harry has a father named Norman who is the President and one of the workers at a company called OSCORB.  What OSCORB does is make weapons for the military.  Norman is working on some sort of gas that can enhance human performance once inhaled.  But soon, Norman realizes he is in one of those now or never situations where he either tests the gas to see if it works or else his company goes down.  Norman test the gas but things seem to wrong and Norman doesn't appear to be the same person.  Anyway, back to Peter.  Peter starts to feel weird but he when feels better, he notices some changes.  For starters, his eyes don't seem to need glasses anymore and plus, he seems to be stronger, make that much stronger and things tend to stick to his fingertips even when the object is non sticky.  And later he notices when danger is coming and he also notices a white sticky string come shooting out of his wriest.  And last, he realizes he has the ability to climb up walls and jump like 100 ft high.  With all his new abilities, Peter decides to join ameuter wrestling to score some big bucks.  He decides to draw out an attire which is a read and blue costume with a black spider symbol in the middle of the chest.  As he takes wrestling, his attire isn't exactly what he drew but it seems that scoring the big bucks won't be hard at all.  But when the wrestling manager decides not to pay Peter the amount he should have gotten (nor did what he got come even close to what he expected) he gets really [mad].  Then when the manager gets robbed, Peter lets the robber go feeling like he got even with manager.  But Peter's feeling change sad fully when he sees that his uncle's car was hijacked and the hijacker shot his uncle.  Peter is bent on revenge to finding the guy who did this and when he does Peter realizes something shocking- The hijacker was the same guy who was the robber who Peter just let go.  If he had cought him then when he should have, then his uncle would have never have been killed.  After that, Peter swears to have never let that happen again.  Before you know, a man now dressed in a costume, which is identical to the one Peter drew, now swings and crawls thru the city of New York stopping crime at now cost.  No matter who does the crime, he'll do the time because he was stopped by the one, the only: SPIDERMAN!  Now that peter's life has had a huge change he now faces many problems: 1, he cannot seem to hold a job cuz he is always staying up late to fight crime.  2, the girl of his dreams, MJ (Mary-Jane) is now dating his friend Harry.  3, the worst of all, a lunatic who travels on the oscorp glider decides to cause chaos over New York.  His name- The green goblin.  The green goblin is super strong like Spiderman, he likes to throw bombs, and the bottom line is that he is just completely crazy.  And what he wants to do is to cause destruction over the city, but to achieve that he must do one thing first-KILL SPIDERMAN.  And worst comes to worst when he discovers certain information on Spidey.DVD Features:2 DiscsDisc 1-Full Screen or widescreen format (for whichever version you get)-Trailor (s)-Mucic videos-Tv Spots-CommentariesDisc 2-HBO making of Spiderman-E!

Several years back there was talk of James Cameron directing a feature based on the SPIDER-MAN comic after all the hype of his megabudget pukefest TITANIC. Finally this year the movie was made flesh under the direction of Sam ""Evil Dead"" Raimi, who is no stranger to comic book territory having directed DARKMAN.I was pleasantly surprised when I saw SPIDER-MAN. Apparently this is loyal to the comic book (I've only owned 2 SPIDER-MAN comics in my lifetime), but what you get is so much more than a live action graphic novel.Tobey MacGuire is perfectly cast as the nebbish high school student Peter Parker who is bitten by a radioactive spider and as a result inherits spider- like powers which he finds he has to use to save his city from the wrath of the menacing Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe, in another effectively slimy performance)-whose secret identity happens to be that of one the man at the local paper he works for, which also assigns him the Spider-Man story.And of course there's the foundations laid for Parker's relationshop with MJ (Kirsten Dunst). Excellent visual effects and a story in which the characters are given a chance to develop without compromising on the expected stunt seqences make SPIDER-MAN one of the best comic book adaptations ever made.

584888,A3CGOPCF6FR3GS,B00005JKCH,Benjamin Seeberger,"[0, 1]","Spiderman is the thrilling tale of Spiderman's birth, his conflict with his most nefarious villain, the undying Green Goblin, and the film which describes the beginnings of his adult relationships with Mary Jane Watson and Harry Osbourne. This film addresses the ancient myth of absolute good and absolute evil, and shows how these two can sometimes become blurred, but with a strong heart can be distinguished. Spiderman includes some exciting scenes of blood-spattering facial fist blows, but never strays into unneeded sensuality and apologetic expletives. A romp through the sky-alleys of a modern American city, Spiderman remains one of our contemporary classics which will be remembered as a landmark in the American mythos.STUDY GUIDE: questions to think about while watching the film...1. Humanity: What events in the film drove Peter Parker to adopting his vigilante attitude toward crime?2. Implications: How is Spiderman's understanding of &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot; an example of contemporary American thought? Think specifically about the nature of evil and the propensity toward intense individual classification when one's existence becomes threatened.3. Evolution: Spiderman was a hero born out of the 60s, springing from both the dangers of genetic manipulation and the problems of substance abuse (in the form of Oscorp Chemicals). Raimi makes little mention of the chemical abuse in the story, and paints it in a much simpler picture of the probable evil in man's soul and the strange world of pseudoscience. Therefore, it is obvious that in many ways, the film departs from its traditional conditioning while remaining loyal to the original personalities of the characters. In which ways is Spiderman the hero shown to be a creation of the contemporary age, versus a creation of the 60s, in the film?4. Realism: America has a long history, not only in comics but in legendary history, of people who take the law into their own hands. If a being like Spiderman existed, could he survive in our real world, or is he only a dream?5. Stageplay: Spiderman is classicly a cynic, an individual thinker, an avid contemporarian (someone &quot;in&quot; the times), a man of passions (versus someone who could care less), an irreligious jokester and a man who is not sure of his destiny, but lives to succeed. Do you feel Maguire fulfills this role? Some critics say he is too much of a &quot;boy&quot; to fill Spiderman's shoes, while others claim it is his boyishness that charms us into belief.

Because Peter Parker wasn't a muscle bound superhero, Marvel comics heros were and are primarely Science bound heroes. With alittle bit of action thrown in, and Spider-Man was no exception. He had to fight villains while on the other side of the city his Aunt is in the hospital because of a heart attack. Tobey Mcguire did an awsome job as both Spider-Man and Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst was okay as Mary Jane.

I can happily say that I was not let down. This movie blew my expectations away. Toby Maguire is a perfect adolescent Peter Parker; Kirsten Dunst is beautiful, and does a pretty good job playing Mary Jane Watson; and Willem Dafoe is outstanding as the Green Goblin. Casting was outstanding. The costumes, unlike those of the X-Men, look like they were torn straight from the comic-book pages. Everything is presented in Sam Rami's (Evil Dead trilogy, Darkman, and Xena television series) wonderfully campy style without going overboard and becoming stupid slapstick mush. Also, fans of the Evil Dead trilogy should be pleased to know that Rami has lots of Evil Dead cameos in Spiderman, Ash's car makes an appearance, as does Bruce CampbellPersonally,I feel Spiderman rises above my other favorite superhero movie: Tim Burton's 1989 Batman. Star Wars Episode II definitely has its work cut out for it, and I don't think there is much chance that the modernized Star Wars will be able to one-up the Wall-crawler.

584895,A82MLYSUUU3CF,B00005JKCH,"Bil Antoniou ""Movie madness!""","[0, 0]","Another comic book superhero finds his way to the big screen in this amiable high-flying adventure. Perpetually adorable Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker, a geeky high-school student with an aptitude for science who is one day bitten by a mutant spider while attending a field trip to Columbia University, and suddenly finds himself developing strange powers much like that of the offending arachnid. Suddenly graced with exceptionally quick reflexes, impressive strength, plus major webshooters biologically emitting from each wrist, Parker goes from quiet underachiever to the city's hardest working crimefighter in no time flat. It seems his transformation couldn't be more perfectly timed either, because a new brand of villain in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) is intent on destroying human life to advance his personal breakthroughs in kinetic power. Kirsten Dunst does her best with the limp character of Mary Jane, a young woman who is constantly being victimized by one man or another and so seems to always be playing the same pity-me note every time we see her. It's no wonder Parker has been in love with her for so long: after all, it seems that falling in love with her would be the most complimentary way to feel sorry for her. Lack of pretentiousness and an excellent first act in the screenplay by David Koepp that allows for the best character development and personal conflict seen in a superhero movie since Michelle Pfeiffer played Catwoman is what sets this thrilling adventure apart from most of the summer fare that audiences are forced to endure, but there's a lack of power to it as well (particularly in the second half) that keeps it from being totally engrossing. This is probably due to Sam Raimi's decidedly uncommitted direction, but it also doesn't help that Dafoe's villain isn't all that scary or dedicated to an easily palpable evil endeavour (his main purpose is to kill the board members who are planning to shut down his corporation, and then after that decides that Spider-Man is his only nemesis and so tries to hurt him through the people he loves). J.K. Simmons pays delightful tribute to the original animated program with his boisterous portrayal of Parker's magazine editor, and Rosemary Harris is a delight as Parker's cookie-baking, patient and loving aunt.

584901,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005JKCH,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 1]","`Spiderman',`Fantastic Four', and `Daredevil' make a very interesting trio of superhero movies, especially as they are, all three of them, based on a Marvel Comics character. To my mind, they exemplify the three levels of quality of `watchable' superhero movies, as opposed to those that are derivative and lacking any spark of imagination.Although many have rated it fairly well, I would put the newest, `Fantastic Four' at the bottom of the list, along with `Hellboy', which I happened to like, but which shares with `Fantastic Four' some serious difficulties to our suspending disbelief. These movies are simply made for fun. You can almost sense the tongue in cheek attitude of the writer and director, let alone the actors. The situation which creates the superpowers is simply too improbable to accept. How is it that a single physical phenomenon would have five totally different effects on five normal, healthy humans? I know just enough about genetics to know how this may be explained, but the film narrative touches on none of this. We are just meant to swallow this story whole. In contrast, the transformation of Matt Murdock is totally plausible. Enhanced senses following loosing one sense are very real. They just posited a bit more than normal ability in that direction. The genesis of Peter Parker's superpowers is a bit more sci fi, but totally believable, given the chance to believe a genetically enhanced spider species.`Daredevil' is probably the least popular of these three movies, and the first time I watched it, it didn't do much for me. On second watching, especially with the extras on the DVD, I appreciated that the moviemakers really accomplished something here. The premise behind both hero and villains is totally plausible and the director, special effects crew, and actors increase this verisimilitude by using very few CGI effects and stunt doubles. Most of what you see on the screen is really Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and Colin Farrell, enhanced with a few wires to accomplish some of the more adventuresome gymnastics. The filmmakers also enhance the picture by doing a lot of the key scenes at night. This is totally logical, as the sightless Daredevil would have the advantage when his sighted rivals would be almost as visually handicapped as he is. `Daredevil' also has the added value of at least three very human relationships. Along with some of the `Batman' and `Superman' flicks, this holds the penultimate spot in superhero quality films.`Spiderman' is easily on the top tier of superhero movies, based not only on the believability of the premise and the humanity of the actors, but also on the relatively effortless special effects, lightly applied to great effect. I also think the actors contribute much to the quality of this film, where with Toby McGuire, there seems to have been just a bit of casting against type, the way Michael Keaton was cast as Batman in the first Tim Burton `Batman'. While I never read `DareDevil' or `Hellboy' comic books, I am familiar with the original `Fantastic Four' and `Spiderman' comics, so I think the relative merit of the films has a lot to do with the relative merit of the comics, since `Spiderman' is the traditional champion among strong comic book fans. I should add a plug for performances by Michael Chiklis in `Fantastic Four' for his comic relief and by Ben Affleck in `DareDevil' for taking the role so seriously, possibly through the influence of his good buddy, Kevin Smith, who appears in a cameo role as the medical examiner.",5,The best of the superhero cinematic experience.

He's stronger, faster, more resilient, and he shoots webs out of his wrists, climbing skyscraper walls with the greatest of ease.By the time he's started college, Peter's learned some hard lessons in life.  His family is torn by tragedy, and his fantasy girl-next-door love, Mary Jane Watson, is going out with his best friend Harry Osborn.  Harry's defense contractor father, Norman, is more like a surrogate father to Peter than a genuine father to his own son.  But, unbeknownst to anyone  -  including himself  -  Norman Osborn suffers an even worse tragedy than any Peter has endured...one that will turn him into the scourge of New York City and Peter Parker's arch-nemesis.This fabulous action-adventure film version of the famous Stan Lee Marvel comic book character suffers only from too much underplaying of the title character by Tobey Maguire, and not enough chemistry between him and co-star Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.  Maguire is credible and likeable as Peter, he just doesn't have much fire until he's got the Spider-suit on.  The rest of the cast are fine, some even superb  -  for a single example, Cliff Robertson is wonderful in the small but important support role of Peter's Uncle Ben.  The special effects and the pacing are uneven, but overall better than not  -  director Sam Raimi is an experienced hand at this kind of movie, and keeps it moving pretty well.But the highest marks go to Willem Defoe, as the tortured Norman Osborn.  Defoe's Osborn not only gets to chew the scenery as the wicked Green Goblin, but simultaneously (and convincingly) also plays the Goblin's first frightened victim  -  himself.  The mechanical-looking costume and props of the Goblin are really incredible, and fortunately are very well-matched by those of Spider-Man, himself.Not a perfect movie, but a damn good one.

This will give you a fair and true description of the movie and its characters and will give you my personal opinion of the movie which should help you make an informed decision on whether to watch this film for the first time or whether to stay away like you have already done for six years.The Story: Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker an aspiring photographer who one day is taking pictures of his crush Mary Jane Watson for the ""School Newspaper"" when he's bitten by a radioactive spider. After the incident Peter goes through a change and gains powers that are similar to a spider, he can walk up walls, shoot web, he gains super human strength, agility and has the ability to sense danger before it comes. One day after Peter uses his powers to take part in a wrestling event to try and win some money, his uncle Ben is shot dead, Peter discovers that his uncle was shot by the man he'd let pass by after stealing money from the wrestling promoter who'd cheated Peter out of money. Peter tracks down the criminal and through a series of incidents the man is killed for which Peter makes the decision to become a superhero, thus giving birth to the phrase ""With great power comes great responsibility."" The best friend of Peter, Harry Osbourne is the son of the CEO of Ozcorp Industries Norman Osbourne. Ozcorp industries develop weapons and other experimental devices for the United States Army, they're also working on an experimental treatment that would increase the speed and strength of soldiers. One night Norman tests this treatment on himself, but something goes wrong with the treatment and it develops an alternate evil personality that we come to know as the Green Goblin.The Characters:Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was a genius choice to make and at the time he was chosen, Tobey was very much an unknown actor but he's now an A-Lister and it's thanks to his stellar performance as the troubled Peter Parker. You gain this sympathy for Peter as he's the typical geek who always gets the worst of everything, you begin to feel like you really want him to succeed in getting the girl and getting the great career being a photographer for the Daily Bugle.Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane was again a genius choice of casting as the chemistry between the two was something inspirational. Kirsten is a really good fit for this character and through the movie you expect her to go with Harry but you know she really wants the excuse she's looking for to get with Peter. To be able to convince the viewer that you're going to go in the opposite direction than is obvious for the story to progress is something special and I hope if there is a Spiderman 4 then these are the first two to get re-signed as the main characters.Willem Dafoe: I've never really been familiar with Willems work and I think a lot of people went into this movie and said ""who the hell is he?"" when he first came on the screen. After about the first half hour and after first seeing him play the psychotic Green Goblin, we came to realise that although to many casual movie goers he may have been an unknown we came to recognise that he was the perfect choice for this part.The Verdict: Many would agree that the Spider-Man character is Marvels greatest creation and the mainstream success of this movie would not dispute that in the slightest. Personally I loved this film, the action sequences between Spidey and the Goblin are intense and something that although they're minimal they get the job done in establishing the characters and the story. The relationship between MJ & Peter is at times heart wrenching as you first see that Peter is starting to win her over then when he saves her as Spidey she's won over by him. Peter becomes stuck in sort of a four way relationship and one of the other people he's competing with is himself. Because of the reason he can't tell MJ he's spidey it becomes heartbreaking to see her love struck by him and yet Peter can't tell her that he's Spiderman. This is a really good movie that gives us a great blend of both character development and action. It takes a completely fantasy element like an average man getting superpowers and puts it in the real world setting with real characters that people can relate to, this is something Stan Lee set out to do when originally creating the spiderman character and this is something that is carried on with the movie.",5,Excellent Debut For Spidey,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,4484,"['review', 'will', 'be', 'split', 'three', 'sections', 'will', 'be', 'Story', 'Characters', 'Verdict', 'will', 'give', 'fair', 'true', 'description', 'movie', 'characters', 'will', 'give', 'personal', 'opinion', 'movie', 'should', 'help', 'make', 'informed', 'decision', 'watch', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'stay', 'away', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'six', 'years.The', 'Story', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'aspiring', 'photographer', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'taking', 'pictures', 'crush', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'School', 'Newspaper', 'when', 'bitten', 'radioactive', 'spider', 'incident', 'Peter', 'change', 'gains', 'powers', 'are', 'similar', 'spider', 'can', 'walk', 'up', 'walls', 'shoot', 'web', 'gains', 'super', 'human', 'strength', 'agility', 'ability', 'sense', 'danger', 'One', 'day', 'Peter', 'powers', 'take', 'part', 'wrestling', 'event', 'try', 'win', 'money', 'uncle', 'Ben', 'shot', 'dead', 'Peter', 'uncle', 'was', 'shot', 'man', ""'d"", 'let', 'pass', 'stealing', 'money', 'wrestling', 'promoter', 'who', ""'d"", 'cheated', 'Peter', 'money', 'Peter', 'down', 'criminal', 'series', 'incidents', 'man', 'killed', 'Peter', 'decision', 'become', 'superhero', 'thus', 'giving', 'birth', 'phrase', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'best', 'friend', 'Peter', 'Harry', 'Osbourne', 'son', 'CEO', 'Ozcorp', 'Industries', 'Norman', 'Osbourne', 'Ozcorp', 'industries', 'develop', 'weapons', 'other', 'experimental', 'devices', 'United', 'States', 'Army', ""'re"", 'also', 'working', 'experimental', 'treatment', 'would', 'increase', 'speed', 'strength', 'soldiers', 'One', 'night', 'Norman', 'treatment', 'something', 'wrong', 'treatment', 'alternate', 'evil', 'personality', 'come', 'know', 'Green', 'Goblin.The', 'Characters', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'was', 'genius', 'choice', 'make', 'time', 'was', 'chosen', 'Tobey', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'unknown', 'actor', 'now', 'A-Lister', 'thanks', 'stellar', 'performance', 'troubled', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'gain', 'sympathy', 'Peter', 'typical', 'geek', 'who', 'always', 'worst', 'everything', 'begin', 'feel', 'really', 'want', 'succeed', 'getting', 'girl', 'getting', 'great', 'career', 'being', 'photographer', 'Daily', 'Bugle.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'was', 'again', 'genius', 'choice', 'casting', 'chemistry', 'two', 'was', 'something', 'inspirational', 'Kirsten', 'really', 'good', 'fit', 'character', 'movie', 'expect', 'go', 'Harry', 'know', 'really', 'excuse', 'looking', 'get', 'Peter', 'be', 'able', 'convince', 'viewer', ""'re"", 'going', 'go', 'opposite', 'direction', 'obvious', 'story', 'progress', 'something', 'special', 'hope', 'Spiderman', '4', 'then', 'are', 'first', 'two', 'get', 're-signed', 'main', 'characters.Willem', 'Dafoe', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'been', 'familiar', 'Willems', 'work', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'went', 'movie', 'said', 'who', 'hell', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'screen', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'first', 'seeing', 'play', 'psychotic', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'came', 'realise', 'many', 'casual', 'movie', 'goers', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'unknown', 'came', 'recognise', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'part.The', 'Verdict', 'Many', 'would', 'agree', 'Spider-Man', 'character', 'Marvels', 'greatest', 'creation', 'mainstream', 'success', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'dispute', 'slightest', 'Personally', 'loved', 'film', 'action', 'sequences', 'Spidey', 'Goblin', 'are', 'intense', 'something', ""'re"", 'minimal', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'establishing', 'characters', 'story', 'relationship', 'MJ', 'Peter', 'times', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'first', 'see', 'Peter', 'starting', 'win', 'over', 'then', 'when', 'Spidey', 'won', 'over', 'Peter', 'stuck', 'sort', 'four', 'way', 'relationship', 'one', 'other', 'people', 'competing', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'MJ', 'spidey', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'love', 'struck', 'yet', 'Peter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Spiderman', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'blend', 'character', 'development', 'action', 'completely', 'fantasy', 'element', 'average', 'man', 'getting', 'superpowers', 'real', 'world', 'setting', 'real', 'characters', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'something', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'when', 'originally', 'creating', 'spiderman', 'character', 'something', 'carried', 'movie']",N/A

584920,A1N00127IDBHD6,B00005JKCH,CConn,"[0, 0]","When I first saw this film over 3 years ago, I was one of the very few people to not enjoy the film. It hardly seemed anything special to me at the time, and it's gigantic success was, in all honestly, quite baffling. Needless to say, I gave a less than glowing review of Spider-Man 1. But now, after years removed from it's opening, and as my knowledge of the comic books this movie was based on grows, I find myself liking this movie more and more. And thusly, feel the need to retract my previous statements about it, and submit a new review of the film.I guess, my main problem with Spider-Man (AKA SM1) originally was it's lack of sophistication and depth. The somewhat hollow, campy, ""popcorn flick"" nature of the movie didn't sit well with me...I didn't understand it. Now however, after viewing it multiple times, I've begun to understand the director's goal in regards to SM1, and, really, its beauty. Spider-Man is not a deep, emotional movie like Batman Begins or even its sequel, Spider-Man 2, would be. It trades in emotion for fun. And it succeeds excellently.Of course, at the beginning of the film, we open with young Peter Parker. A geek, hopelessly in love with a girl whom won't even give him the time of day. The real beauty of this origin really can't be observed without a knowledge of the source material. But once you are familiar with said material, it's quite astonishing. Amazingly, the first 30 minutes of Spider-Man are a near duplication of Amazing Fantasy #15 (Spider-Man's introductory issue). There are some changes to be sure. Such as Mary Jane's role in it all (in the comics, she doesn't appear until much later), and certainly plot lines that would have just been too campy for a big blockbuster of 2002. That aside, SM1 does an amazing job of bring Spider-Man's original, comic book origin to the screen. As good as, if not more so, than any other comic book adaptation yet made.The acting, one of the main sticking points of my original review, is still not all I would like it to be. While Maguire delivers a strong performance as our hero, he doesn't quite inhabit the character like other actors have in the past and present. But he definitely does a good job, and while its not the best performance of his career (Seabiscuit receives that honor), he does give an admirable effort that leaves little room for complaints. Willam Dafoe also gives a stand-out performance as one of Spider-Man's deadliest villains, The Green Goblin. Dafoe injects his usual creepy demeanor into the character, and while, like Maguire, it isn't the best performance of his career, it is noticeable and memorable. I've also come to appreciate acting of both Rosemary Harris as the caring Aunt May and the campy brilliance of J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson. Sadly however, the real weak link in the cast would have to be Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. I've always thought Dunst was a fairly capable child-actor, but as an adult she seems to have actually lost talent, as her performance in SM1 seems sadly hollow, adding nothing to the character, and hardly bringing it to life at all. Though I will admit, her character is written as poorly as it is acted. The director's GweMJ concept (the fusing of Peter's two comic love interests Gwen Stacy and MJ), is quite flawed, and seems to diminish MJ's character rather than add to it.One of my biggest problems of the film would have to be the score. Despite being a big fan of Danny Elfman, I was overwhelmingly disappointed with his score for SM1.  It seems to lack any and all distinctiveness, which a theme that sounds more like Batman-lite than Spider-Man, and a overall collection of notes that entirely unimpressive, and easily forgettable.Though may complain about SM1's special effects and poor CGI, I didn't find them particularly troublesome. While they aren't the best effects in the world by any means, they're acceptable, and overall, the actions are quite well done. Probably the best actions scenes in a superhero movie up until that point, in fact.Probably the aspect of the movie, is also the worst. The camp factor. While, positively, this makes the film extremely fun and easy to watch and rewatch, it also kills any and all possibility of it every being a ""great"" film, an epic film. This could turn some away (as it did me), but, thankfully, two years later, this ""flaw"" was greatly rectified greatly in Spider-Man 2. SM2 almost makes SM1 an introduction rather than an individual film, and this, in turn, makes SM1 a better movie in its own right. The lack of seriousness and drama is now understood, and even welcome, as it's all being saved up for Act #2 (and maybe even #3) in Spider-Man's multi-film saga.All in all, my opinion of Spider-Man 1 has changed quite drastically over the past few years, and frankly, I'm glad it did, as Spider-Man is indeed a wonderful popcorn flick that nearly everyone can enjoy.8/10",4,The Cinematic Equivalent

You don't even have to be familiar with the original book to appreciate it, though if you are, you'll see immediately that the scriptwriters have been careful to remain true to it while still updating it for the 21st Century.  What's more, it retains the angsty and sometimes dark flavor for which Marvel has long been famous.  Hero Peter Parker starts out as a nerd--a science whiz who serves as the butt of jokes and small-scale bullying by the more conventionally popular boys in his high school (his only real friend is Harry Osborn, whose father Norman has long served as his own substitute dad), and whose lifelong object of worship, Mary Jane Watson, hardly knows he's alive.  Then, on a class trip to the Museum of Natural History, he's bitten by a hybrid spider that has been exposed to ""the largest electron microscope on the East Coast,"" and overnight develops astonishing powers--his vision normalizes, he gains superhuman strength and speed, he's able to sense approaching danger and to shoot sticky webbing from ducts on his wrists.  At first he uses these abilities with little thought, but when his beloved Uncle Ben is killed by a carjacker while waiting for him (unaware that Peter had signed up to ""spend three minutes in the ring"" with a notorious wrestler in hopes of winning $5000 to buy himself a car), he realizes that ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" and remakes himself as ""Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,"" a sort of one-man vigilante force who strikes out at muggers and purse-snatchers, rescues people from burning buildings, and arouses the ire of newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson.  Meanwhile Norman Osborn, desperate to save his high-tech company, has exposed himself to an experimental process intended to create superhuman powers--and it has, but with terrifying side effects: he becomes the Green Goblin, an airborne mischief-maker who soon realizes that only Spidey has what it takes to stop him.  For some time Osborn doesn't even realize what his new alter ego is doing, and when he does he's terrified, but a move by his Board of Directors to force him out brings all his latent negative personality to the fore and he becomes the Goblin consciously too.  Yet there's still hope for him: his final words to Spidey are ""Don't tell my son!""Of course, the best part of the film are the effects, which are splendid, especially the sequences in which Spidey is seen swinging through the ""topless towers"" of New York by his webbing.  Yet the complex storyline and carefully studied and developed personalities of the major characters (the only one whose motivations aren't very well explained is Jameson, who seems to hate Spidey just out of sheer ill temper!) give them an added dimension that will make the movie enjoyable by more than just the classic teen-and-twentysomething audience.  Old-time members of the Mighty Marvel Marching Society will delight in its accuracy, and strangers to the Marvel Universe will be provided with a tight and fascinating introduction to it.

SPIDEY himself) in this plotline have Gwen Stacy as his girlfriend instead, and Mary Jane was actually only just still around the background as Foster's best friend. The story goes that Goblin killed Gwen Stacy (issue # 121) and in the following episode of the comic book (#122), the lead was taken into the death of the Green Goblin. They should've opted to put Mary Jane as SPIDEY's leading lady for the sequel - which in fact would've given a good stretch for the movie indeed.If only the movie had never taken its shortcut, it could've been perfect.I was first turned off when I heard its the-guy-with-Micahel-Douglas who'd play the part of Peter/Spiderman, but it turned out good. As for Kirsten Dunst as &quot;spiderman's b*tch&quot; (so'd the then- child actress have told David Letterman) - well, they coul've opted for someone else to've played the role of Mary Jane Watson.The other turn off for me in the movie is the soundtrack and appearance of that forgettable pop singer - they could've really done better in this aspect (I's thinking of MN OIL, being that there've been rumours back in '78 to put their vocalist Peter Garrett in Spidey spandex costume (year that I got converted since to be a fan of Spide at six years old)). Good AEROSMITH theme rendition though.And so we now come to its lurking sequel with the leering villain Doc Ock -- smells like romance for Pete's aunt ?

Which he always want to say something to her, but always ended up, not saying nothing. One Day, He and the High-School students went to a field trip on the research on Spiders, which the Spiders are actually Radioactive. When Peter gets bitten by One of the Spiders and the next day, He changes differently, getting Perfect 20/20 Vision, His muscles are Strong and Everything atleration on his Body are more much Powerful and also having Spider-Sense into Him. When a billionaire business man scientist (Williem Dafoe) gets exposed himself after accidently to an Experimental Gas, developes into a Split-Personality and He becomes the Green Goblin. Peter is actually Best Friend to the Scientist Billionaire Son (James Franco). When one day, when Peter is experimenting on his New Gift, which is a Great Thing or a Curse-His grandfather is Murder by a Thug-then Peter uses his Power to become a Crime Fighter being called:Spider-Man. When Spider-Man sees for the First-Time, the Green Golbin. Since they have two very strong different Powers. Spider-Man is nearly becoming a Hero for the City of New York and the Green Golbin is the New Villian in Town, they fight, just until One of Them is Dead. But Peter/Spider-Man has to choose his Future, what he thinks is Right for Him. Since he always wanted to be with Mary-Jane but it's a challenge, he has to choose to make it Right to his Decision.Directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead Trilogy, Darkman, A Simple Plan) makes a strong entertaining Action-Adventure film, Based on a Comic Book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Based on Marvel Comics. Raimi does tribute to his Earlier Movie, including:Darkman, which his lastest movie does have some Familiarity with Darkman, which it was a Comic Book Style Flick before it becomes a Short-Lived Comic. This has a Smart Screenplay by David Koepp (Carlito's Way, Jurassic Park, the Panic Room), which is often Funny and at times-Campy (Although Screen-Writer Alvin Sargent & Scott Rosenberg did some Re-Writing for the Movie). Terrific Score by Danny Elfman and the Visual Effects supervised by Oscar-Winner:John Dykstra are One of the Few Highlighs of the Film. Tobey Maguire is just Perfect as the Lead in this Flick (Although James Franco did auditioned to Play-Peter Parker). Williem Dafoe is Fun as the Villian of the Movie. The Supporting Cast are Wonderful. (This film recieves Two Oscar Nominations for Best Sound & Best Visual Effects.) DVD has an terrific Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (On different Sets of DVD's).

As a lifelong Spider-Man fan, I was very pleased with Sam Raimi's faithful interpretation of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's character, and his world.  The writing couldn't have captured the spirit of the comic any better, and the casting was truly inspired.  Unlike so many other comic book movies, Spider-Man brought the best of the series to the screen without needless changes aimed at ""marketing"" to a broader audience.My only complaint with the film was the Green Goblin's costume.  Defoe is one of Hollywood's greatest modern faces, he can convey a broad range of emotions simply by changing the expression on his face. Yet in Spider-Man his face is covered with a metal shell which doesn't move at all.  Not even when he speaks.  This unfortunate decision, the only bankrupt concept inherited from the Batman films, mutes Defoes effectiveness as the Goblin right when needed most.  I found myself wishing he confronted Spider-Man as Norman Osborn rather than the lifeless robot impersonating the Green Goblin.",4,An Amazing Spider-Man Movie,1020211200,"05 1, 2002",2002,1096,"['saw', 'Spider-Man', 'last', 'night', 'sneak', 'preview', 'sponsored', 'famous', 'food', 'company', 'lifelong', 'Spider-Man', 'fan', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'faithful', 'interpretation', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'character', 'world', 'writing', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'captured', 'spirit', 'comic', 'better', 'casting', 'was', 'truly', 'inspired', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'Spider-Man', 'brought', 'best', 'series', 'screen', 'needless', 'changes', 'aimed', 'marketing', 'broader', 'audience.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'was', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'costume', 'Defoe', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'modern', 'can', 'convey', 'broad', 'range', 'emotions', 'simply', 'changing', 'expression', 'face', 'Spider-Man', 'face', 'covered', 'metal', 'shell', ""n't"", 'move', 'Not', 'even', 'when', 'unfortunate', 'decision', 'only', 'bankrupt', 'concept', 'inherited', 'Batman', 'films', 'mutes', 'Defoes', 'effectiveness', 'Goblin', 'right', 'when', 'needed', 'most', 'found', 'wishing', 'confronted', 'Spider-Man', 'Norman', 'Osborn', 'rather', 'lifeless', 'robot', 'impersonating', 'Green', 'Goblin']",N/A
584937,A81UC9NWP39KI,B00005JKCH,Christopher H. Jansmann,"[2, 2]","There is good reason that Spider-Man is one of the most popular characters in the Marvel Comics universe.  Unlike many of his ""peers,"" Spider-Man is a fully developed character with depth and background... both of which (in the proper context) make him a believable, relatable character.As is appropriate for this movie (the first movie in what will hopefully be a long franchise), Director Sam Raimi takes the first quarter of the picture to create the core character of Peter Parker, and document his transformation into Spider-Man.  Updated for today's society, Peter is introduced as the prototypical high school geek, torn down by the ""popular"" students while at the same time pining away for the girl next door who is, for all practical purposes, out of his reach.Fate steps in during a school field trip, changing his life forever.  While Peter initially is buoyed by his new-found abilities and what they can do for him against those who have bullied him in the past, he quickly learns the painful consequences of their misuse.  It's a lesson that Raimi successfully interweaves through the rest of the picture (and one that will continue into the second movie, Spider-Man 2).Raimi has done an unparalled job of bringing the comic universe Spidey inhabits into the real world streets of New York City.  He has created a visual environment that allows you to believe such characters could, indeed, exist just around the next block.  Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man; he nails the essence of the conflicted soul of the character.  Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe are also well cast, although I fear that Dunst was reduced to the obligatory screaming siren in more scenes than were necessary.  (As a side note, she is allowed to explore the character of Mary Jane much more fully in the second movie -- thank goodness!)Overall, this movie was every bit as good as its extraordinary movie gross would indicate.  This DVD version of the film includes many bonus features and behind-the-scenes tidbits that are fascinating but sadly too short.  Commentary by Raimi, Dunst and others is extremely interesting and fun to hear; the unique pop-up commentary contains unusual tidbits that are also worth exploring.  If you watch the film on a PC, the pop-ups can also link to the excellent Spider-Man website for additional background information.If you are a fan of Spider-Man, you'll love this film.  If you've never heard of him, this is a great way to gently ease into the mythos of this extremely popular character.",5,"Polished, enjoyable big-screen adaptation",1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,2542,"['good', 'reason', 'Spider-Man', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'characters', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'universe', 'many', 'peers', 'Spider-Man', 'fully', 'developed', 'character', 'depth', 'background', 'proper', 'context', 'make', 'believable', 'relatable', 'character.As', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'first', 'movie', 'what', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'long', 'franchise', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'first', 'quarter', 'picture', 'create', 'core', 'character', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'document', 'transformation', 'Spider-Man', 'Updated', 'today', 'society', 'Peter', 'introduced', 'prototypical', 'high', 'school', 'geek', 'torn', 'down', 'popular', 'students', 'same', 'time', 'pining', 'away', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'practical', 'purposes', 'reach.Fate', 'steps', 'school', 'field', 'trip', 'changing', 'life', 'forever', 'Peter', 'initially', 'buoyed', 'new-found', 'abilities', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'who', 'have', 'bullied', 'past', 'quickly', 'painful', 'consequences', 'misuse', 'lesson', 'Raimi', 'successfully', 'rest', 'picture', 'one', 'will', 'continue', 'second', 'movie', 'Spider-Man', '2', '.Raimi', 'done', 'unparalled', 'job', 'bringing', 'comic', 'universe', 'Spidey', 'real', 'world', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'created', 'visual', 'environment', 'believe', 'such', 'characters', 'could', 'indeed', 'exist', 'just', 'next', 'block', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider-Man', 'essence', 'conflicted', 'soul', 'character', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'cast', 'fear', 'Dunst', 'was', 'reduced', 'obligatory', 'screaming', 'siren', 'more', 'scenes', 'were', 'necessary', 'side', 'note', 'allowed', 'explore', 'character', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'much', 'more', 'fully', 'second', 'movie', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'extraordinary', 'movie', 'gross', 'would', 'indicate', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'many', 'bonus', 'features', 'behind-the-scenes', 'tidbits', 'are', 'fascinating', 'sadly', 'too', 'short', 'Commentary', 'Raimi', 'Dunst', 'others', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'fun', 'hear', 'unique', 'pop-up', 'commentary', 'contains', 'unusual', 'tidbits', 'are', 'also', 'worth', 'exploring', 'watch', 'film', 'PC', 'pop-ups', 'can', 'also', 'link', 'excellent', 'Spider-Man', 'website', 'additional', 'background', 'information.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Spider-Man', ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'great', 'way', 'gently', 'ease', 'mythos', 'extremely', 'popular', 'character']",N/A

Cecena ""ssjanifan""","[4, 10]","Spider-man, Spider-man, does whatever a spider can..... no doubt you've heard that (in)famous little ditty somewhere, which belongs from Peter Parker's infamous little campy 60's cartoon series.  So at least some of you know who Spider-man is.  Now, the show was based on a character who had his own comic series, and he first appeared in a final issue of a short-lived fantasy series called, &quot;Amazing Fantasy.&quot;  40 years after that issue saw print, that same character has finally made his first ever appearance on the big screen(excluding cameos in other movies).  And what can I say?  It SUCKS.  The acting is bad, the plot is messed up(okay, so Uncle Ben dies around June, since it's shortly before Peter's graduation, and then only an hour later, it's THANKSGIVING?!  WHEN DID ALL THIS TIME PASS?!), there is no chemistry between any of the actors, the SFX are lame, and the score by Danny Elfman is forgettable(when did he fall from grace?)  All in all, Spider-man is one of the worst movies ever made.  Avoid it and this horrid DVD like the plague.",1,There'll be a hero to save us...

584939,A16EFRMJOKEI0B,B00005JKCH,Christopher Wyer,"[0, 0]","I'm not the world's biggest comic book fan but I don't exactly avoid them on purpose either.  But I really looked forward to seeing Spider-Man on the big screen in a serious modern-era movie.  And as far as super hero comic book characters turned into full length movies, this one didn't let us down.  Fans of the old show will miss the opening song, but Danny Elfman more than makes up for the missing piece of nostalgia with his continuing creativity in the scoring of movies.  Comic book perfectionists will complain about the slight changes that they made to the origins of Spider-man but to the average fan the changes are hardly noticeable.  These few shortfalls aren't nearly enough to knock this movie down even a single notch.The casting was one of the best jobs that I've seen.  Tobey Maguire took some time off from his more serious roles (The Cider House Rules) and could become THE nations next big super hero.  Kirsten Dunst has really come into her own over the last couple years and has the potential to become a very serious leading lady.  And the casting of William Dafoe as the ""Green Goblin"" was really the only way to go.  Aside from Christopher Walken, nobody can look that evil just by changing his facial expressions.  And even the small supporting roles added to the movie.  Macho Man Randy Savage's appearance as wrestler ""Bone Saw"" made me and my friends laugh for quite a while.  And the newspaper editor, while somewhat overacting, had the entire theatre laughing at once.The story itself doesn't really need a lot of explaining.  It's a well constructed story of how a simple kid grows to become the city's newest superhero.  A bite from a genetically altered spider causes changes in young Peter Parker's life.  His vision difficulties fade and he discovers strange new powers, such as the ability to climb walls and spin his own webs.  Peter Parker aside, William Dafoe's character and his transformation into the new super-villain The Green Goblin is a main focal point.  Dafoe's collapse from the top of the corporate world was explained very well and acted beautifully.  The story that evolves is a tangled web (ha-ha) of both actor's everyday characters and there respective alter-egos and the way all four personalties interact with each other.  All in all, the movie is a well paced action flick with a little bit of love story thrown in.There are a few warnings that go with this movie.  First, if you suffer from really bad motion sickness, I highly recommend motion sickness pills as a must have before watching this movie.  The other warning that I give is for people who don't like computer generated effects.  There are several shots in this movie that were obviously computer generated and although they looked good at times, some really looked fake.  I understand that they were necessary elements but I heard a few people complaining about it as we left the theatre.  And don't worry to much about it.  None of the shots were as bad as the airplane crash in ""Air Force One"".  Just a slight warning.Now on to the comparisons.  As far as the other superhero turned movie star, nothing can come close to Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and the entire ""Superman"" series is phenomenal for the time period that they were made in.  Compared to ""X-Men"" of a couple years ago, ""Spider-man"" was a much better movie.  I can only hope that ""The Incredible Hulk"" lives up to it's predecessors.  And compared to the other big Blockbusters already this year, this was way better than ""The Scorpion King."" And although I haven't seen ""Star Wars Episode 2"" yet, my friends weren't to thrilled with that either.  So if you don't mind sitting in crowded theatre's ""Spider-man"" should be your choice for this summers earliest must see movie.The Breakdown:1.  Plot-9 (well constructed story, well in tune with the comic)2.  Characters-9 (took a lot of time to develop almost every character)3.  Flow-9 (just a few lulls for a 2 hr. movie isn't that bad)4.  Atmosphere-10 (well constructed scenes as well as Danny Elfman's music is a big plus)5.  Cinematography-9 (excellent all around effects with a few minor glitches)6.  Entertainment Value-10 (2 hrs. just flew by)7.  Replay Value-9 (well worth seeing twice)8.  Casting/Character Depth-9 (doesn't get much better)9.  Relevance to genre-9 (great comic book turned movie, not quite as good as Batman)10.

Not some forced and transparent emotional nudges, but genuine heart. Peter Parker's relationship with his sweet aunt and uncle is touching and his love for Mary Jane is in no way possessive or sexualized. Spider-Man is not hardened like most other modern superheroes, but a sensitive and relatable young man who tries his best to do what he thinks is right. This may sound corny, and in many ways it is, but it's refreshing to see in a superhero movie. Writer David Koepp has a cheesy sense of humor, and many of the dramatic scenes come of as histrionic, but the terrific cast keeps these elements in check. The casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was a stroke of genius. He's awkward and tender, yet handsome and virile. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is just as fantastic. She embodies the girl-next-door cuteness and is greatly effective as the damsel often in distress. Willem Dafoe is sinister and sadistic as the Green Goblin/Norman Osbourne. James Franco is solid as the troubled and emotionally stilted Harry. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are adorable as the aunt and uncle. J.K. Simmons is the perfect money-grubbing, sleaze-ball newspaper publisher. Director Sam Raimi, who previously worked on the superhero film Darkman, was very well-suited to adapt Koepp's screenplay. Raimi has a very stylized and precise camera technique, one that is match-made for the kind of swooping and constantly moving story of Spider-Man. This film rightly puts the characters first and the visual spectacle second, a tip many of the latest generation Marvel film producers could take.",4,"Spider-Man, Deliver Us From Evil",1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,1671,"['What', 'Spider-Man', 'almost', 'other', 'superhero', 'movie', 'heart', 'Not', 'forced', 'transparent', 'emotional', 'nudges', 'genuine', 'heart', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'relationship', 'sweet', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'touching', 'love', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'way', 'possessive', 'sexualized', 'Spider-Man', 'not', 'hardened', 'most', 'other', 'modern', 'superheroes', 'sensitive', 'relatable', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'best', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'may', 'sound', 'corny', 'many', 'ways', 'refreshing', 'see', 'superhero', 'movie', 'Writer', 'David', 'Koepp', 'cheesy', 'sense', 'humor', 'many', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'come', 'histrionic', 'terrific', 'cast', 'elements', 'check', 'casting', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'awkward', 'tender', 'handsome', 'virile', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'just', 'fantastic', 'girl-next-door', 'cuteness', 'greatly', 'effective', 'damsel', 'often', 'distress', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'sinister', 'sadistic', 'Green', 'Goblin/Norman', 'Osbourne', 'James', 'Franco', 'solid', 'troubled', 'emotionally', 'stilted', 'Harry', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'are', 'adorable', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'perfect', 'money-grubbing', 'sleaze-ball', 'newspaper', 'publisher', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'who', 'previously', 'worked', 'superhero', 'film', 'Darkman', 'was', 'very', 'well-suited', 'adapt', 'Koepp', 'screenplay', 'Raimi', 'very', 'stylized', 'precise', 'camera', 'technique', 'one', 'match-made', 'kind', 'swooping', 'constantly', 'moving', 'story', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'rightly', 'characters', 'first', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'second', 'tip', 'many', 'latest', 'generation', 'Marvel', 'film', 'producers', 'could', 'take']",N/A

Most likely this is because the movie is trying to make a top-notch film from a children's comic book, which is not necessarily easy to do.Most of the acting is good. Toby Maguire as Peter Parker-Spider Man is not bad. He does well at portraying Peter's shy, picked on life at school, and then his transformation to a more confidant superhero.Kirsten Dunst is alright as M.J., but her acting does not stand out as amazing--there is nothing to complain about, however.Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne/the somewhat overdone villain the Green Goblin, deffinitely stands out. He plays Norman well as he deteriorates from a nice businessman to a trapped man enslaved to the Goblin's intimidating mask.So far, so good. This film, coming as it did after a history of many films crammed with convincing special effects, it would be expected that Spider Man would be the same. Unfortunately, the effects here are somewhat disappointing. Especially in one scene where Peter Parker is jumping up the wall of a building, it looks like he is in a computer game--a well done, convincing computer game, but still a computer game.The character of the Green Goblin is something I have somewhat of a beef with. I would have no problem if Sam Raimi, the director of the film, had kept his mean tempermant at the same level, but his own admittance of his standing as an anti-hero and a lunatic seems to go a little over the top.With some decent action scenes and good acting, this movie is fairly good, but not the dream film.",3,"Good, but not the best",1057449600,"07 6, 2003",2003,1638,"['most', 'part', 'nothing', 'terrible', 'pick', 'Spider', 'Man', 'However', 'film', 'hold', 'high', 'interest', 'Most', 'likely', 'movie', 'trying', 'make', 'top-notch', 'film', 'children', 'comic', 'book', 'not', 'necessarily', 'easy', 'do.Most', 'acting', 'good', 'Toby', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'Parker-Spider', 'Man', 'not', 'bad', 'well', 'portraying', 'Peter', 'shy', 'picked', 'life', 'school', 'then', 'transformation', 'more', 'confidant', 'superhero.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'alright', 'M.J.', 'acting', 'not', 'stand', 'out', 'amazing', 'nothing', 'complain', 'however.Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Norman', 'Osborne/the', 'somewhat', 'villain', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'deffinitely', 'out', 'Norman', 'well', 'nice', 'businessman', 'trapped', 'man', 'enslaved', 'Goblin', 'intimidating', 'mask.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'film', 'coming', 'did', 'history', 'many', 'films', 'crammed', 'convincing', 'special', 'effects', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'Spider', 'Man', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'Unfortunately', 'effects', 'here', 'are', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'Especially', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'jumping', 'up', 'wall', 'building', 'computer', 'game', 'well', 'done', 'convincing', 'computer', 'game', 'still', 'computer', 'game.The', 'character', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'something', 'have', 'somewhat', 'beef', 'would', 'have', 'problem', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'director', 'film', 'had', 'kept', 'mean', 'tempermant', 'same', 'level', 'own', 'admittance', 'standing', 'anti-hero', 'lunatic', 'go', 'little', 'top.With', 'decent', 'action', 'scenes', 'good', 'acting', 'movie', 'fairly', 'good', 'not', 'dream', 'film']",N/A

584952,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005JKCH,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 0]","That Sam Raimi was the right director for Spider-man's debut on the big screen is obvious once you've seen this film.  His penchant for cartoon-like moments in his other films (e.g., the Evil Dead series, the Quick and the Dead, and the comic-inspired Darkman) boded well for success.  Likewise, his encycopediac knowledge of the character was not new - he'd been collecting Spiderman comics ever since he was a kid.  With such a director at the helm, and with Spider-man creator Stan Lee looking over his shoulder, it's no wonder that Spider-man the Film looks and feels exactly like we'd imagine based on reading Spider-man the Comic.  When compared to, say, the Batman films, Spidey fans must have breathed a sigh of relief that the filmakers got the character mostly right.Most of our favourite Spidey characters are here - Peter Parker (played to &quot;wallflower&quot; perfection by Toby Maguire), his colleagues Harry and Flash, the fiery readhead Mary Jane Watson, and of course Aunt May and Uncle Ben.  The film covers Spiderman's origin (slightly updating the spider bite from a radioactive spider to a genetically enhanced one).  The absolute highlight of the film is his attempt to make money wrestling, where he takes on a seriously buffed-up Randy &quot;Macho Man&quot; Savage (called &quot;Bonesaw&quot; in the film).  Raimi regular Bruce Campbell appears as the ring announcer, apparently using the Elvis hair and wardrobe acquired from his recent &quot;Bubba Ho-tep&quot; film.We then advance to the main story - the battle with arch-enemy Green Goblin, here played by Willem Dafoe, who does an admirable job personifying the villain even though half the time we can't see his face.  Likewise Maguire's Webslinger personifies the comic character using body language, standard Spidey poses, and a generous helping of CGI to aid his webslinging trips through the concrete jungles of Manhatten.  The CGI is normally not intrusive or obvious - a glaring exception being one scene where Spidey takes on 5 muggers simultaneously, where the animation is jerky and unrealistic.  Mostly, though, it's smooth and doesn't defy the laws of physics too badly....True Spider-man fans will question certain decisions of the filmakers, of course.  Most notable is the absence of Gwen Stacy, who is killed by one incarnation of the Green Goblin in the comics.  Unfortunately, we know Mary Jane will be alright when GG threatens her - the same wouldn't be true if it had been Gwen up there.  Similarly, the romantic quadrangle between Peter, Harry, MJ, and Gwen would have been really fun to see on film, if only to give actress Kirsten Dunst a break from all the testoterone-driven action from an otherwise male cast.  Maybe we'll get to see Gwen (and even Felicia (the Black Cat)? he asks hopefully) in the sequels.  Finally, the patented Spider-man wisecracking banter is somewhat submerged in overly melodramatic fight scenes.  Likewise, MJ's confidence - hopefully Raimi allows himself and his characters to loosen up as the series progresses.The DVD is quite good, with some long-ish documentaries on the making of the film and on bringing Spidey to the big screen.  There are some neat comic-book extras as well (although the navigation through some of the comic-book segments is annoying).

584954,A2W0SHGPT7O0OI,B00005JKCH,"""critic_2000""","[6, 8]","Finally, ""Spider-Man"" is here! Personally, I thought it was great that they decided to do a live-action version of this classic comic book character rather than a dumb animated one, like the TV show. To me, live-action is always better, mainly though because the films looks more real. I just saw ""Spider-Man"" and have to say that it was fantastic! I already cannot wait for it's sequel, which will hopefully be released next year in 2003.If you've ever read the comic books and saw the show, then you've probably got a good idea on what this movie was all about. Spider-Man vs. the evil Green Goblin (played by William Dafeo). It's also about how Peter Parker (played perfectly by Tobey Maguire) came to be Spider-Man, and trying to win over the affection of the beautiful Mary-Jane (played by Kirsten Dunst). There's a lot of action and spin-tingly moments. Although I still thought ""Star Wars--Episode II, Attack of the Clones"" was a better film, ""Spider-Man"" was still awesome and worth seeing, but basically because I am a bigger ""Star Wars"" fan than ""Spider-Man"" fan...I really only went to see ""Spider-Man"" because I heard it was a good movie and I'm really into sci-fic/fantasy/action movies. Plus, I also think Tobey Maguire is an excellent actor (but Hayden Christensen in ""Star Wars"" is hotter, and I believe, more talented!).Anyway, getting back to ""Spider-Man"", the special effects were amazing and a great touch to the film. The storyline and dialouge were strong, but dialouge seems to never be a very important element in fantasy and action films, in reality. The acting was superb, including the performances by the supporting roles. I can't wait for the ""Spider-Man"" DVD to be released and I'm glad I got the chance to see it on the big screen. I believe ""Spider-Man"" will be nominated for a few Oscars next year...I think though mostly for technical nods, if any. Probably not any acting nods, and most definitely not a best picture nod because fantasy films just don't get nominated for best picture, which is wrong, I know...because there are a lot of excellent fantasy films out there that the Oscar judges overlook, come Oscar time! Sam Raimi did an excellent job with the directing...though it would've been interesting to see James Cameron direct this, like he was first supposed to. And Danny Elfman provides a wonderful, haunting score. Elfman is no John Williams or James Horner, but he does a good job in his own right. ... All in all, ""Spider-Man"" is an awesome film and should be seen by all fans of Spidey! It was rated PG-13 for some very mild lanuage, some violence, and a few scary moments.

584957,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JKCH,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[2, 2]","I remember when this film was first released, the immediate buzz and praise it received, and the expression on my face after the credits began to roll.  I was in utter awe, and rightfully so.  Until `Batman Begins' there hadn't been a single superhero movie that could compare.  `Spider-Man' marks the beginning of the `serious' superhero film, the film that's more about plot and relationships then about high adrenaline action sequences (although they are here in large heaping amounts).  Sam Raimi and David Koepp brought to life one of the most revered and beloved comic book heroes and did so brilliantly.First smart move was the casting choices.  Tobey Maguire was a genius choice for Peter Parker.  Peter Parker was a nerdy loner and looking at Tobey you'd assume the same for him.  He has that awkward appearance, that fearful and cautious step and that guilt written all over his face.  He plays this role perfectly.  Kirsten Dunst was also a wonderful pick for Mary Jane Watson, Peters love interest.  Anyone would have to be blind not to fall in love with her.  Willem Dafoe finally impressed me, mostly because the role of Norman Osborn (the Green Goblin) just seems like the role he was born to perform, and James Franco is good as Harry, Norman's son, although he (it this film at least) is more background noise.The second smart move was making this a much more `bright' superhero film.  What I mean is, instead of following the darker subtext of films like the original `Batman' or `Daredevil', `Spider-Man' is almost a happy film.  It never falls into camp, like the horrid `Batman & Robin', but it keeps things on the up and up, cheery and...happy.  Yes I know it deals with issues like the death of Peter's Uncle Ben and the psychosis of a said crazy Green Goblin, but the action and animation is done in such bright, crisp way that the mood is never heavy and never detracts from the enjoyment of the film.The third smart move was taking the time to really develop the main characters and explain the origin of Spider-Man, never rushing into things nor bogging the film down with `too-much' information, but giving us a perfect balance.  By the end of the film you truly care about Peter and his plight.  He's more than just an action-hero...he's a human being with real problems and distractions and concerns and you want him to succeed.  You want him to `get-the-girl'.`Spider-Man' will probably be remembered as the first of the `great' superhero movies.  Finally a superhero film was taken serious, was worked and brought to cinematic perfection, not taken lightly and thrown together, but molded into a great movie.

Thankfully he pulled of Peter Parker brilliantly. I was amazed as to how well casted this movie actually turned out. The movie seems a bit on the long side, but this is actually a good thing. I've been complaining that movies of late have been relatively short. Its not as long as Fellowship of the Ring, but it is longer than X-Men, and that gives us more time for character development, and while I would have liked to have seen Mary Jane and Harry Osbourne focused on a little more over all the characters were all fleshed out nicely. This is a very emotional film, and I appreciate Raimi's focus on Spider-Man as the tragic hero. This is what Spider-Man is, and that is the critical point that I think that some critics were missing. Spider-Man fights to keep a positive swing (pun intended) on things. He is very much surrounded by constant negativity, and villains deliberately try to go after his friends and family just because he's Spider-Man! The problem with being Spider-Man, for Peter, is just being Spider-Man. This has been the focus of the comic book for years, and while the argument over organic web-shooters, versus mechanical web-shooters can go on for ages it works well with the film. Everything about this film is brilliantly done, well thought out, and at time so well done it is frightening (William DaFoe as the Green Goblin, arguing with William DaFoe as Norman Osbourne.) In this film you see Spider-Man try so hard to write the wrongs of the world around him, only to end up getting hurt. The tragic hero manages to keep a smile on his face and spout witty remarks just the same. The best part of the movie is how real the characters felt. It's a bloody shame that NOTHING about the CGI animations looked or felt real. With as real as the characters felt, the lackluster videogame looking CGI animations worked against the over all film, and in many instances an easy fix should have been available for the sizable budget this movie had. The problem? Probably that ILM has all of its good people out on Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and probably wasn't available to do the CGI sequences. The sad fact is that only ILM can do CGI sequences and have them look good. Every movie without ILM's best people on board has terrible effects. Which is why, were I shooting it I would have done the special effects in a very different way. It is hard, but not impossible to get a human to move that way. All you'd need to do is digitally speed him up. Also, in the first act of the film there is a scene where Peter Parker is chasing after the car jacker who killed his uncle and the entire scene is painfully CGI, and taking McGuire's real face and grafting it to the CGI body would have drastically improved the scene. When Star Wars and other movies offer stunning CGI visuals, and even Nintendo's remake of Resident Evil has such attention to detail right down to loose threads in the clothing there is no excuse for such bad CGI. The effects are the only thing that keeps me from giving this a perfect score, because this could have otherwise been the best comic to film adaptation of them all.

584962,A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2,B00005JKCH,"Daniel B. Waldman ""Film Guru""","[1, 1]","I always liked the Spider-Man comics.  Spider-Man (& his alter ego, Peter Parker) is portrayed as an ordinary guy struggling to balance superheroics with the real world.  This is in contrast with D.C.'s Batman comics where Bruce Wayne, as a millionaire, has no financial concerns, and Superman, where his job as a mild mannered reporter helps put him where he is most needed.  But I always had reservations about some parts of the Spider-man origin story.  In the comic book, after Peter Parker acquires his Spider powers, he becomes a professional wrestler (like in the film), but he garners some fame and fortune and when the robber runs past he doesn't stop the crook simply because he didn't feel it was his job.  The movie pointedly gave Peter Parker a motive for letting the robber go.  Later in the comic that very same robber breaks into Peter's house and murders his Uncle Ben.  This struck me as a severe plot contrivance which was lessened in the film by having this villain kill Uncle Ben in a carjacking.When I read about the talent behind this movie I was excited.  Sam Raimi has impressed me ever since Evil Dead 1, Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst were also perfectly cast.  And when I watched the movie they did not disapoint.  The romance between them is the most stirring part of the movie.This movie possesses a spirit similar to Superman: The Movie, even if it lacks that film's epic quality. There are parrellels to Superman.  Both are mild-mannered in their alter egos, both work for a newspaper -- Clark Kent as a reporter, Peter Parker as a freelance photographer, both have loudmouthed editors, although Perry White is a supporter of Superman, while J. Jonah Jameson loathes Spider-Man (J.K. Simmons in a terrific performance).  But the plot of Superman is grander, beginning on Krypton, going to Smallville, Metropolis and for the climax all over the U.S. while Spider-Man keeps itself firmly in New York and is divided into 2 distinct acts; pre-graduation, and post-graduation.This film has some great acting and humorous, stylish direction with a few visual cues lifted from the Batman & Superman movies which feel more like homages than rip-offs.The plot is a basic origin/first adventure narrative.  We are introduced to Peter Parker, shy high school senior, on his way to a field trip where he gets bitten by a geneticly enhanced spider giving him super powers, which he at first wants to use for profit, but then, after tragedy strikes, he uses it to do ggod deeds.Simultaneous to Peter's transformation, his best friend's father, Norman Osborn, is conducting tests on himself to turn himself into a super soldier.  These experiments cause him to go insane and become the Green Goblin.Naturally it is only a matter of time before super hero and super villain meet.Another refreshing elemnt of this movie is that the origins are kept seperate, unlike so many other super hero movies where the villains and the heroes are involved in creating each other.  Spider-Man has no direct involvement in the creation of the Green Goblin, and the Green Goblin is not involved in Spider-Man's development.The only liablilty this movie has is in the visual effects.  When Superman was released it came with the tag line ""You will belive a man can fly.""  They spent that much time on the special effects to make certain the the flying scenes looked realistic.  In Spider-Man, though, the web-swinging moments are obviously computer animated, resembling a computer game more than a feature film, as though Sam Raimi didn't care much about the effects either.Thankfully the human element of the movie saves the day, keeping it compelling to allow me to suspend my disbelief through these more awkward special effects sequences.",5,Spiderman,1038614400,"11 30, 2002",2002,3741,"['always', 'liked', 'Spider-Man', 'comics', 'Spider-Man', 'alter', 'ego', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'portrayed', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'struggling', 'balance', 'superheroics', 'real', 'world', 'contrast', 'D.C.', 'Batman', 'comics', 'where', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'millionaire', 'financial', 'concerns', 'Superman', 'where', 'job', 'mild', 'mannered', 'reporter', 'put', 'where', 'most', 'needed', 'always', 'had', 'reservations', 'parts', 'Spider-man', 'origin', 'story', 'comic', 'book', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Spider', 'powers', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'film', 'fame', 'fortune', 'when', 'robber', ""n't"", 'stop', 'crook', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'job', 'movie', 'pointedly', 'gave', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'motive', 'letting', 'robber', 'go', 'Later', 'comic', 'very', 'same', 'robber', 'breaks', 'Peter', 'house', 'murders', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'struck', 'severe', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'was', 'lessened', 'film', 'having', 'villain', 'kill', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'carjacking.When', 'read', 'talent', 'movie', 'was', 'excited', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'impressed', 'ever', 'Evil', 'Dead', '1', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'were', 'also', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'disapoint', 'romance', 'most', 'stirring', 'part', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'spirit', 'similar', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'even', 'film', 'epic', 'quality', 'are', 'parrellels', 'Superman', 'are', 'mild-mannered', 'alter', 'egos', 'work', 'newspaper', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'reporter', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'freelance', 'photographer', 'have', 'loudmouthed', 'editors', 'Perry', 'White', 'supporter', 'Superman', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'Spider-Man', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'terrific', 'performance', 'plot', 'Superman', 'grander', 'beginning', 'Krypton', 'going', 'Smallville', 'Metropolis', 'climax', 'U.S.', 'Spider-Man', 'firmly', 'New', 'York', 'divided', '2', 'distinct', 'acts', 'pre-graduation', 'post-graduation.This', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'humorous', 'stylish', 'direction', 'few', 'visual', 'cues', 'lifted', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'movies', 'feel', 'more', 'homages', 'rip-offs.The', 'plot', 'basic', 'origin/first', 'adventure', 'narrative', 'are', 'introduced', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'shy', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'way', 'field', 'trip', 'where', 'bitten', 'geneticly', 'enhanced', 'spider', 'giving', 'super', 'powers', 'first', 'use', 'profit', 'then', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'do', 'ggod', 'deeds.Simultaneous', 'Peter', 'transformation', 'best', 'friend', 'father', 'Norman', 'Osborn', 'conducting', 'tests', 'turn', 'super', 'soldier', 'experiments', 'cause', 'go', 'insane', 'become', 'Green', 'Goblin.Naturally', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'super', 'hero', 'super', 'villain', 'meet.Another', 'refreshing', 'elemnt', 'movie', 'origins', 'are', 'kept', 'seperate', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'where', 'villains', 'heroes', 'are', 'involved', 'creating', 'other', 'Spider-Man', 'direct', 'involvement', 'creation', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'not', 'involved', 'Spider-Man', 'development.The', 'only', 'movie', 'visual', 'effects', 'When', 'Superman', 'was', 'released', 'came', 'tag', 'line', 'will', 'belive', 'man', 'can', 'fly', 'spent', 'much', 'time', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'certain', 'flying', 'scenes', 'looked', 'realistic', 'Spider-Man', 'though', 'web-swinging', 'moments', 'are', 'obviously', 'computer', 'animated', 'resembling', 'computer', 'game', 'more', 'feature', 'film', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'effects', 'either.Thankfully', 'human', 'element', 'movie', 'day', 'keeping', 'compelling', 'allow', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'more', 'awkward', 'special', 'effects', 'sequences']",N/A

584964,A1GALZCXD8FHOR,B00005JKCH,Daniel L Edelen,"[1, 1]","""Spiderman""-  a film eighteen years in arriving according to the director's commentary - is worth waiting for. Rather than give a long-winded, hard to follow review, I'll keep to the highlights -Just perfect:1) The movie itself. Director Sam Raimi (of ""Evil Dead"", ""A Simple Plan"",  ""Darkman"", ""Xena"", and ""Hercules"" fame) nails the film dead-on. The look and feel of the settings, the choices of shots, the comic book feel, and editing are top notch. He manages to draw out the best in the characters and the actors who play them. As is noted several times in the commentary tracks, Raimi chose characterizations over action, and I believe that is what separates ""Spiderman"" from so many other films in the Action genre. The characters are real and people you can identify with.2) Casting and acting. Fans groaned at some of the casting choices, but the actors were perfect. Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker is magnificent, capturing the difficult inner conflicts of the character. The final scene in which his inner dialog plays out perfectly matches the subtle expression changes on his face. Kirsten Dunst was a concern for me as Mary Jane, but brought a lively interpretation to the role. Willem Dafoe looks like a villain, even without a mask, but still was warm when his character was meant to be sympathetic. J.K. Simmons was born to be J. Jonah Jameson, the gruff newspaper head. And Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris were spot on perfect as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Simply wonderful casting.3) The DVD. It's crisp and lively with a host of additional features. In particular were pop-up balloons that would give info during the film, two commentary tracks - one from the directing team and one from the visual effects team, background on the Spiderman comic book (villains, loves, etc.), and some outtakes and screen tests. My only disappointment in the screen tests was the lack of tests that featured actors who didn't get the parts. That you never see this anyway - must be a contractual thing - on other discs doesn't make this lack unusual, only missed.4) Sound. The DVD's sound options were pleasantly distinct. The dialog boost option worked wonderfully, much better than on some other DVDs I've seen.5) Faithfulness to the source. Best of all, the movie itself is true to the comic. They felt little need to mess around with the history of Spiderman. There are a few modifications, but they are unobtrusive and make sense. Thank you for not screwing Spiderman fans!Mixed:1) Spotty visual effects. Some of the CG effects looked like CG effects. The run across the rooftops was stilted. Others were brilliant. Case in point, the battle scene in the burning apartment. The commentary by the visual effects team noted that the CG of Spiderman avoiding weapons thrown by the Green Goblin fooled everyone, even other effects team members. Additionally, the commentary noted hundreds of spots where CG work was used that went completely unnoticed by me and certainly other viewers. That these were so seamless speaks well of the effects crew. Now if other parts can only be fixed up for the next film....2) Deleted scenes. The visual effects team made note of hundreds of effects and scenes that were left on the cutting room floor. However, the DVD lacks a set of deleted scenes. In particular it was noted that the final confrontation was cut down considerably. It would have been nice to see those scenes. I guess they are being held for a box set once the series has run its course.Poor:1) DVD navigation. It's remarkably poor. Tiny glowing lights highlighted sections of the navigation. On some TVs they might be impossible to see. Too subtle to be helpful. You might think you got stuck in a section of features, but the system is working. Several people told me they had problems with the subtle changes in the navigation, too.All in all, one of the best superhero movies (and accompanying DVDs) to hit the market since ""Superman II"".

I'm happy to say that I wasn't let down....Tobey maguire stars as high-school science nerd Peter Parker, who is bitten by a genetically altered spider and finds himself with the ability to cling to walls, make tremendous leaps, sense danger, shoot webs, etc. He decides to cash in on his powers by becoming a pro wrestler, but fate has other things in store for our young hero. A personal tragedy teaches him that ""With great power, comes great responsibility"".Enter billionaire industrialist Norman Osborne: desperate to make the breakthrough that will enable his company to keep a lucrative government contract, he makes himself the test subject of his own strength-enhancement formula. The strength aspect works, but the added bonus is the addition of another personality: The murderous Green Goblin, who takes it upon himself to dispose of Norman's enemies.The Goblin is on a rampage through Manhattan when he runs up against Spidey for the first time. He senses a kindred spirit in Spidey, and attempts to enlist him as a partner. Barring that, he'll just kill him.....LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLEEEEEEEEEEE!!!I sat through Spider-Man with a HUGE grin on my face; It's JUST like the comic-Book. Fans will be thrilled by the obvious love Director Raimi has for the source material, and non-fans will appreciate the fact that Raimi delivers a rock-solid action movie without resorting to the usual comic-book movie campiness.Comic fans will also revel in the many appearances of classic Spidey characters such as Mendel Stromm, J. Jonah Jameson (A superb J.K. Simmons), Betty Brant, Flash Thompson, etc., as well as mentions of Dr. Conners and Daily Bugle photographer, who in the books become villains The Lizard and Venom, respectively. Raimi regular Bruce Campbell is hilarious as the Ring Announcer in the wrestling sequence, and Kirsten Dunst shines as love interest Mary Jane Watson; It's easy to see how Peter is smitten with her. Willem Dafoe walks a thin line as the homicidal Goblin, and he nevr crosses the line between insanity and hamminess. Maguire delivers a star-making performance as the hapless teen who rises to the occasion by becoming the hero the city so desperately needs. Kudos to Raimi for using real N.Y.C locations; The city has never looked better!

First it was Batman and then it was X-Men and now Hollywood brings out it's hardest punch (I believe) with the web slinging action flick of Spiderman.Tobey McGuire plays the part as Peter Parker the little high school nerd that is the joke of the crowd.  Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane the beautiful young women who Peter Parker was in love with since the third grade.  As the stories goes Peter Parker is living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. He finds himself wanting to get the girl of his dreams and yet doesn't know how.  Parker is at a school field trip and taking pictures for the school paper.  He makes a move on Mary by taking a picture of her for the school paper as he is doing so a spider dangles his web down and lands on Peter's hand and bites him.  When Peter gets home he is very tired and goes straight to his room and falls asleep.  When he wakes up he finds that he has changed and that he doesn't need his glasses anymore and that he has gained ""miraculously"" muscle tone.  As he finds out that these powers are too good to be true we see Parker jumping buildings and climbing buildings.  As he see's Mary having a difficult time and he wanting to find a way to her heart he enters a wrestling contest and wins only  a little money and not the full amount.  As he is exiting the building though he see himself in the middle of a robbery and let's the guy pass because he see's the company as being possesive.  When Parker is out starting to go home he finds a crowd with cops and he makes his way through and finds his uncle shot on the ground.  He hears from the cops talking to eachother were the suspect is and runs to find him. This is where you see a great chase scene. As he finds his powers and tries to strengthen them there is another evil starting to brew on the other side of New York and that is the character called the Green Goblin. The green goblin is a man who was fired from his jobed and gets really ticked and wants to get even.  The green goblin's son is friends with parker and is dating the Mary Jane.  Yet as the story starts to unfold Mary Jane starts to fall for Parker when he doesn't even know it.  As Parker becomes more known, the Green Goblin tries to unite forces with him and yet SPiderman refuses and the green goblin tries to kill him.The whole movie is very well done and not over romanced and all the roll playing of the characters was very well done.

Haase ""dothehucklebuck""","[2, 8]","The new movie ""Spiderman"" proves how Hollywood over-kill can squash any sense of fun found in the adventures of comic book heroes. The movie is uneven, long and overdoses on computer special effects. The beginning scenes offer promise as Peter Parker (played fairly by the pensive Tobey MacGuire) is bitten by a super geneticized spider and metamorphisizes into Spiderman. However, the spider theme is hurriedly abandoned; it would have been great to have Parker cohabit with the anachrids as Bruce Wayne did with bats in ""Batman"". Once the villain enters the picture, the Green Goblin, the movie stretches for its plot. Wilhem Defoe is wasted as the Goblin; his costume could have been from the Power Rangers TV show and his banter with his alter-ego in the mirror is truly laughable and ridiculous. Kirsten Dunst is bland as the heroine and the viewer wonders how Parker could stay infatuated with her for so long! Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are also wasted as the Aunt and Uncle of Parker, and the moral message is simple beyond belief: ""With Power comes great responsibility"". Haven't thousands of movies and books dealt with this theme over the years? Danny Elfman's score is a copy of his own Batman themes, and director Sam Raimi (remember the 1980's bomb ""Dark Man""?) copies a scene out of Burton's film by having a bunch of giant balloons showcased at a city event. ""Spiderman"" has none of Burton's macabre or Richard Donner's (director of 1978's ""Superman"") sense of fun and tongue in cheek homage. Also, the computer special effects make people move in positions which would break most people's backs or necks, regardless of whether they are superheroes or not.",2,"""SPIDERMAN"" FAILS TO CATCH ME IN ITS WEB!!!",1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,1681,"['new', 'movie', 'Spiderman', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'over-kill', 'can', 'squash', 'sense', 'fun', 'found', 'adventures', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'movie', 'uneven', 'long', 'overdoses', 'computer', 'special', 'effects', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'offer', 'promise', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'played', 'fairly', 'pensive', 'Tobey', 'MacGuire', 'bitten', 'super', 'geneticized', 'spider', 'Spiderman', 'However', 'spider', 'theme', 'hurriedly', 'abandoned', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'have', 'Parker', 'cohabit', 'anachrids', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'did', 'bats', 'Batman', 'villain', 'picture', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'movie', 'plot', 'Wilhem', 'Defoe', 'wasted', 'Goblin', 'costume', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'TV', 'show', 'banter', 'alter-ego', 'mirror', 'truly', 'laughable', 'ridiculous', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'bland', 'heroine', 'viewer', 'how', 'Parker', 'could', 'stay', 'infatuated', 'so', 'long', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'are', 'also', 'wasted', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'Parker', 'moral', 'message', 'simple', 'belief', 'Power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'Have', ""n't"", 'thousands', 'movies', 'books', 'dealt', 'theme', 'years', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'copy', 'own', 'Batman', 'themes', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'remember', '1980', 'bomb', 'Dark', 'Man', 'scene', 'Burton', 'film', 'having', 'bunch', 'giant', 'balloons', 'showcased', 'city', 'event', 'Spiderman', 'none', 'Burton', 'macabre', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'director', '1978', 'Superman', 'sense', 'fun', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'homage', 'Also', 'computer', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'people', 'move', 'positions', 'would', 'break', 'most', 'people', 'backs', 'necks', 'regardless', 'are', 'superheroes', 'not']",N/A

Toby Maguire is excellent as the smart but nerdy Peter Parker and doubles perfectly as the beefed up, super cool Spiderman.  Toby Maguire has shown us what a good actor he is in films like ""Wonder Boys"" and ""Cider House Rules"" so it is great to see him in an action film where he can let loose and just have fun.  Kirstin Dunst is good as Peter's sexy but elusive love interest and Willem Dafoe is delightfully demented and evil as the Green Goblin.  The action sequences are exactly what you'd expect and my only problem was some slow pacing at certain points in the movie.  With the origin of Spidey out of the way and introducing Peter Parker's character, the next movie should be able to move completely forward into non-stop action.

584974,A2MW0RYIXMEYGS,B00005JKCH,Dave,"[4, 9]","What kind of movie is Spider-Man? Are you sure you really want to know? This movie is not for the weak of heart...Summer 2002, millions of die-hard Marvel comic fans were treated to seeing one of their heroes come to life on the big screen. Spider-Man. When I first saw the preview for Spider-Man, it was right before viewing my first PG-13 movie - Lord of the Rings (Another movie for another review). When confronted by the action scenes of the movie, and the grotesque view of the Green Goblin's face, my first thought was ""Ew gross, another dumb blow-'em-up flick."" followed by ""When will they stop with the previews and just show Lord of the Rings?""When the movie came to theaters, however, I checked out some of the reviews at Focus on the Family's Plugged-in website and found that, while it did contain blow-'em-up action scenes and grotesque goblin faces, it did not contain the other junk that usually goes with such movies: swearing every ten seconds by the clock, and more skin than a hospital DOCTOR typically sees. So, after securing permission from my parents, we went to see it. In case you are thinking of seeing it but don't know for sure, or if your kids are hitting you up to go see it, here is as detailed of a review as I can give about the movie's good points and bad points, from the perspective of a 16-year old Christian.In case you are like I was, not knowing about the general basics, here they are:  Peter Parker is bitten by a spider and is transformed into...Spider-Man. Just in time, because Norman Osborn, scientist for OsCorp has just turned into a raving lunatic because of his reckless Human Performance Enhancers test...on himself. Peter/Spidey chooses to protect the city of New York, and ends up in a fight to the death with The Green Goblin.GOOD POINTS: As has been said in other reviews, Spider-Man draws a distinct line between good and evil. When Spider-Man misuses his abilities and refuses to stop a fleeing robber because it ""wasn't his problem"" tragic events result. His Aunt recites nearly all of the Lord's Prayer at one point. There are several expressions of ""Thank God for you"". When offered a chance to join the Green Goblin, Spider-Man chooses good. The Green Goblin, in fact, is portrayed almost as a demon possession of the father. From a purely secular standpoint, the movie is excellent, with its dazzling special effects, allowing us to see and swing along with Spider-Man through New York City. The soundtrack music by Ben Elfman is but the icing on the cake. The story and plot are also very well formed, but occasionally poorly written. The relationship between Peter and Norman Osborn is especially interesting. When Norman is sane, he accepts Peter as a fellow science whiz and almost like a second son. (Then they both go don their respective costumes and beat each other up.) Harry Osborn, Peter's friend, tells Peter at the end that ""Spider-Man must pay"" for something Harry thinks Spider-Man did, he then says ""But thank God for you Peter. You're the only friend I have."" The door is left WIDE open for Spider-Man 2.BAD POINTS: Violence is a key factor. In an attack, Green Goblin drops a bomb-like object to kill his former employers who fired him, and, in a gruesome manner, dispatches them. Spider-Man and Green Goblin slug it out several times, as well as the mandatory explosions and city chaos/blow-'em-up stuff previously mentioned. One key character (who I cannot name) is gored by a blade, nearly bloodless, but intensely violent. Several bad words are used, but unnecessarily so, sadly. The sweet aunt tells the uncle to get off the ladder before he falls on his...um, patootie. I don't remember the D-word being used, but at one point someone makes a remark that is translated ""You are really making me angry"". Kirsten Dunst, Spider-Man's honey, is nearly always immodestly dressed, or as I like to say ""HEY! WHERE'S YOUR SHIRT!?"" At one point she is chased by four hoods who have obvious intent. Spider-Man rescues her, and they kiss as they rain pours down. Dunst's shirt gets...wet, shall we say. When Peter, after realizing his super strength, goes to a wrestling rink to win the [money]prize, there are several severely immodestly-clad women, but it's not entirely emphasized, and otherwise, there is no nudity or immorality, implied or other.MY THOUGHTS: Kids shouldn't see this movie, in my opinion. If it weren't for the bad language, and lack of clothes (""Pants don't cost THAT much, do they?!"") it would be better, but the fact is that it isn't. For those who know what to be on guard for, it's a great watch.""Whatever life has in store for me, I will always remember these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift; my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man.""SPIDER-MAN TRIVIA FUN FACT: Stan Lee makes a cameo as a citizen hero who saves a little kid from falling city wreckage.SPIDER-MAN QUESTION: If Spider-Man wears that suit, how does he climb the walls?

584975,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00005JKCH,David Baldwin,"[3, 3]","""Spider-Man"" has to be viewed as the first chapter of a continuing saga.  My reaction to having seen it originally that it was okay for a first film in a continuing series but I was hankering for more.  ""Spider-Man 2"" filled in the blanks from the first film, therefore, this film should be seen in conjunction with the second for a more rewarding experience.  Just think about the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy before it's cycle was completed or ""Kill Bill:Volume 1"" before the interminable wait for ""Volume 2"".  That said, ""Spider-Man"" does a terrific job in exploring the origins of Peter Parker's evolution to the legendary web-spinner.  It's only the film's main plotline involving the Green Goblin that get's short-shrift here.  If the filmmakers were allowed to expand their work beyond the prescribed two hour time limit it's possible that this story would have been developed better.  Tobey Maguire does an excellent job as Peter Parker/Spider-Man as does Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin.  It's good to see that an actor of Dafoe's calibre was chosen for this part instead of a ""star"".  Kudos to Dafoe for having to act wearing that ridiculous looking green armor.  Kirsten Dunst is fetching as Mary Jane Watson.  This character truly comes into her own in the second film.  James Franco broods effectively as Harry Osborn.  Indications seem to be that this is a character to look out for in future installments.  It was good to see an old hand like Cliff Robertson deliver a solid turn as Uncle Ben.  I will admit that my familiarity with Spider-Man is limited to the cartoon series from the 1960's.

Director Sam Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp have gotten it just right.  The story of high school nerd Peter Parker's (Toby Maguire) transformation into the powerful, crime-fighting Spider-Man is light, humorous, and filled with action and thrills.  The major characters from the comic are brought to life by the fine cast.  I hope we get to see more of JK Simmons' J Jonah Jameson next time around.Unlike many, I thought that the CGI effects worked well.  The one disappointment in this film--and it was a big one--was the design of the Green Goblin's costume.  Why did they put that blank Power Rangers-type helmet on him when they had such a fine actor playing the role?  The Goblin's mask should have been malleable, just as it is in the comics, so that we could have seen Willem Dafoe's acting.

Man Does spidermman Deliver??? You Betcha i was so amazed by the special effects of this film whe i watched it for the first time.My favorite actor in this film is Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane. Wow is she hot and she does a great job staying true to her charactor.This is one of the best superhero movies out there bar none.it raises the envelope in terms of action suspense and canage and its a little different from the commic book but mostly the same which is a good thing.Spiderman aka Peter Parker is just like he is supposed to be portrayed in the comics as a nervouse dweeb - nerd that has a tough time making new friends and getting girlfriends.All that will change when he gets bitten by a spider that gives him amazing SuPERPOWERS beyond his Wildest dreams. Lets just say Peter after  getting bitten by that Spider is never the same again. Like the saying goes change is good and in peter Parker's case it is but not in the green Goblin's case aka Harries dad. He makes a big mistake and turns into an evil dude with wicked powers.This is a nice long well done movie that is so fantastic and epic i cant even begin to imagine  how hard it must have been for the directors and crew to get this film to be as special as it is.So Sam Raimi  Directs this great film and boy does he do a great job staying true to the comic books and bringing Spiderman to life at last on the big screen. it seems these days no comic charactors or even cartoon charactors can stay away from the big screen and thats great for us movie lovers.Scoobydoo was one cartoon among a few others that was made into a movie no not an animated movie a realistic looking movie like this one.

584982,A3Q80Q6YFP5W6Q,B00005JKCH,David Roy,"[3, 7]","Spider-Man is the epitome of a summer action flick.  It doesn't have wonderful acting or a wonderful script, but it is interesting enough and loud enough to make it worth the money that you pay.Tobey Maguire is wonderful as Peter Parker.  He's the perfect casting, creating a mix of shyness, naivet&eacute; and brooding after his uncle is killed.  It's hard to say how he is as Spider-Man himself, since he has so few lines.  But what we did see was pretty good.  He only made a couple of quips, which disappointed me a bit, since that's what Spider-Man is known for.  Hopefully, that was because he was still getting used to the superhero thing and will happen more in the second movie.Kirsten Dunst is a great Mary Jane.  She runs the gamut between a flighty exterior while being extremely troubled inside.  It helps draw the male audience in, of course, that she's gorgeous in the role.  She doesn't have as big of a role as I would have liked, however.  She fulfills the love interest role admirably, but the script doesn't give her much to do besides that.  Hopefully that will also change in the next movie.  I did like how the movie ended between Peter and Mary Jane, though.  It was very appropriate to the character.Willem Dafoe was the perfect Green Goblin as well.  He handles the scenes where he's arguing with himself exceptionally well.  A lesser actor would have sunk deep into the campiness of the role, but he holds his own.  The dialogue is still pretty bad, but Dafoe rises above it.  He is able to play both the sinister charm of Norman Osborn as well as the total insanity of the Green Goblin.Those are the main characters, but I have to mention J.K. Simmons as the crotchety newspaper publisher, J. Jonah Jameson.  He fits the character in the comic to a T.  He simply steals the few scenes that he's in.  I don't know if the role was written quite right (I don't remember Jameson being that cruel to people like his wife), but Simmons hit a home run with what he was given.The plot of the movie is your typical superhero action plot.  There's nothing really new here, but I was pleased to see how close they came to the actual comic plot.  There are some differences, of course, but it was very recognizable.  They kept true to the spirit of the characters for the most part, with only minor changes.  As a fan of the comics, I am very thankful. I think that had a lot to do with Sam Raimi's direction, which is also fabulous.The main drawback of the film (besides the rather pedestrian plot) is the CGI effects.  There are too many times where it actually looks fake.  I know CGI isn't perfect, but it really throws you out of the movie when your eyes register the effect itself rather than the result of the effect.  The other drawback is James Franco, the guy who plays Harry Osborne.  He had no believability whatsoever, and he was very uninteresting.

Chick flicks are well known for dealing with the internals of the characters, and if there's one thing that SPIDER-MAN excels at it's giving us a look at what's going on in the hearts of everyone in the film.I've never seen a superhero film where everyone is so human, so in that way, Raimi carries on the tradition of the original comic book series--the tragedy of a young hero with feet of clay.As a long-time comic reader, I viewed this movie with some trepidation--as much confidence as I had in Raimi the director, I still had to recognize that this one was a Major Hollywood Blockbuster, with Major Hollywood Money and Major Hollywood Politics behind it. After seeing what impact those forces had on the Batman and Superman franchises, I just couldn't help worrying.I shouldn't have been the least bit concerned: Raimi, Dunst, and--most of all--Maguire deliver knock-out punches on every level.  Peter Parker is so much the nerd that even the nerdy girls won't let him sit next to them on the bus, MJ Watson is the popular girl from a dysfunctional family with an ache in her heart, and everyone--even the bad guy--garners sympathy from the audience.In many ways, this is a story about pain, grief, loss, and the hope that can blossom from them. It spends as much time on the dark side of humanity as it does in the four-color world of superheroes, and even the hero's motivations aren't always noble.Everyone in this film cares for someone, and everyone pays the price for doing so. The story ends on a maginficent note that is at once tragic and hopeful, and if there's ever a movie that had me ready for a sequel, this is it.  It stands as one of my &quot;had to watch it again, immediately&quot; landmark films.If anyone wants to know how superhero movies should be done, they should call Sam Raimi.

He possesses agility in leaping from skyscrapers and can spin webs from his wrist. Henceforth he assumes the identity Spider-man to combat evil manifested in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), a Species-look-alike perpetrator that terrrorizes the city with a glider that drops bombs.Spider-Man embodies the heroics created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko who had graced the popular Marvel Comics to become an comic icon as a crime-buster - and now the film further increases the fanaticism. It is a US 140 million blockbuster and gaudy with sleek costumes and galvanizing stunts. It is digitally-enhanced F/X to capture panoramic swings in its most realistic and The Times Square action-sequence is one of the most dazzling in cinematic history.Yet the superhero adventure fails to surprise because of its conventional storyline of good-vs-evil. The self-discovery and mutation renders so much punch that the second-half falls relatively lack-lustre. Fortunately Spider-Man spins a complex web of humanity and empathy for the characters - and Tobey Maguire as the lead is the emotional core who captivates with his vulnerability in handling his growth traumas, doubts and fears. No less sterling is Willem Dafoe who is all hysterics and maniacal in his split personality inherited from the aftermath of a blundered experiment. Kirsten Dunst as his love-interest Mary Jane, James Franco as his buddy and even his uncle Ben played by Cliff Robertson show surprising dimensions.Spider-Man is thus an evocative tale of a hero struggling with his adolescence, betrayal and murder. And Sam Raimi displays the same sensitivity here with his eariler works like Darkman with his flawed avenger. He directs it with eye-popping visuals like Army of Darkness and the comic hero resonates in its true-self. Its brooding hero is what makes Spider-Man a nifty web - and Maguire has definitely triumphed the cynics with his soulful spin.",4,Spider-man spins a complex web of humanity in characters,1020211200,"05 1, 2002",2002,2115,"['excursion', 'Columbia', 'University', 'science', 'lab', 'bespectacled', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'miraculous', 'vision', 'sculpted', 'body', 'genetically-altered', 'spider', 'bits', 'agility', 'leaping', 'skyscrapers', 'can', 'spin', 'webs', 'wrist', 'identity', 'Spider-man', 'combat', 'evil', 'manifested', 'form', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Species-look-alike', 'perpetrator', 'city', 'glider', 'bombs.Spider-Man', 'embodies', 'heroics', 'created', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'who', 'had', 'graced', 'popular', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'become', 'comic', 'icon', 'crime-buster', 'now', 'film', 'further', 'fanaticism', '140', 'million', 'blockbuster', 'gaudy', 'sleek', 'costumes', 'galvanizing', 'stunts', 'digitally-enhanced', 'F/X', 'capture', 'panoramic', 'swings', 'most', 'realistic', 'Times', 'Square', 'action-sequence', 'one', 'most', 'dazzling', 'cinematic', 'history.Yet', 'superhero', 'adventure', 'surprise', 'conventional', 'storyline', 'good-vs-evil', 'self-discovery', 'mutation', 'renders', 'so', 'much', 'punch', 'second-half', 'falls', 'relatively', 'lack-lustre', 'Fortunately', 'Spider-Man', 'spins', 'complex', 'web', 'humanity', 'empathy', 'characters', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'lead', 'emotional', 'core', 'who', 'vulnerability', 'handling', 'growth', 'traumas', 'doubts', 'fears', 'less', 'sterling', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'who', 'hysterics', 'maniacal', 'split', 'personality', 'inherited', 'aftermath', 'blundered', 'experiment', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'love-interest', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'James', 'Franco', 'buddy', 'even', 'uncle', 'Ben', 'played', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'show', 'surprising', 'dimensions.Spider-Man', 'thus', 'evocative', 'tale', 'hero', 'struggling', 'adolescence', 'betrayal', 'murder', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'same', 'sensitivity', 'here', 'eariler', 'Darkman', 'flawed', 'avenger', 'eye-popping', 'visuals', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'comic', 'hero', 'true-self', 'brooding', 'hero', 'what', 'Spider-Man', 'nifty', 'web', 'Maguire', 'definitely', 'triumphed', 'cynics', 'soulful', 'spin']",N/A

I enjoyed the action that Sam Raimi gave us, although I thought it was too fast. It was like Spiderman was too fast for gravity, and that kind of bothered me. It also bothered me that they eliminated his web slingers. That really irked me, because it made Spiderman more careless with his webbing... because there was an endless supply. I was like ""What the HELL!"" - The web shooters were an integral part of who Spiderman is, because it made him more human, less freak. Yes, he could walk on walls. Yes, he can jump around. Yes, he was a nerd... but he was never socially acceptable, which is why he was so much more free as Spiderman... with a great sense of humor, confidence, and well... superhero-ness. In the comics, Parker is a nerd. A total geek... and as Spiderman, he's still a man in that suit. He's not superman but they made him seem as though he was as strong as superman, and frankly, that irked me. Beyond that, the movie was cool. I wish the fight scenes were slowed down.

584996,A3EJYJC25OJVKK,B00005JKCH,"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer""","[1, 2]","The movie-theatre adaptation of the Spider Man franchise went through years of failed plot attempts and numerous legal battles to materialize but despite all of the obstacles, it would absolutely succeed by getting praising reviews from both critics and movie-goers alike and it definitely deserved all of that and I would like to add my share of praise to ""Spider Man"". This movie is unbelievably great. (DANGER: THERE COULD BE POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD BUT HOPEFULLY NOT.)Tobey McGuire was on the border of being perfect for the role of playing the 'nerdy', bumbling, yet intelligent and caring student Peter Parker who gains new abilities after being bitten and genetically altered by a genetically engineered spider and also gains 'spider like senses' that warn him of approaching danger. He tries to keep them under wraps until one fateful night when his uncle Ben Parker is murdered in a carjacking that he failed to stop and vowed to get his revenge for his uncle's murder by fighting for justice and apprehending criminals. However it becomes a chaotic juggling circus as he juggles being a superhero, fighting crime and upholding the law, working as a newspaper editor for his disgruntled employer J. Jonah Jameson, who seems to hate Spider-Man with a passion, and also trying to win the love of Mary Jane Watson who is in love with Parker's best friend Harry Osborn, who is the son of company CEO, Norman Osborn. I couldn't imagine how he manages all three of these burdens and how much sleep that Mr. Parker loses over time but as they say ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"".Norman, in this movie is, experimenting with a new genetically altering chemical lab but something goes wrong and genetically enhances his genetic makeup and turns him into a monstrous new character who eventually becomes the ever feared Green Goblin while remaining a human but with new powers but goes mad over his company Oscorp being threatened with being shut down by government officials and he goes into defiance of them but yet also threatens the safety of the citizens of New York in the process and Spider Man now has to go head to head against him and protect the public from his malice. William Dafoe definitely shows the pure evil expressions yet the internal vulnerabilities of Norman Osborn.Quite frankly, I love the choice of the actors who were selected to play the characters. Tobey McGuire as I said before was on the border of being perfect for the role of Peter Parker/Spider Man as McGuire brings out the somewhat 'nerdiness' but yet also the intelligence and the vulnerability of Parker's character and also the intelligence and the agility of Spider Man. Even the costume was almost spot-on and not overdone like some of those in ""X-Men"" and in the 1997 flop ""Batman & Robin"". Kristen Dunst filling in the role as Mary Jane Watson was absolutely unforgettable and showed the incredible beauty and the intelligence of Watson. My favorite though was the villainous role of William Dafoe playing the ever so frightening Green Goblin and the schizoid Norman Osborn. Then there are some relatively overlooked but unforgettable characters like the high school ruffian bully Flash Thompson. I actually loved watching the fighting scene between Parker and Thompson and its hilarious outcome. I feel that this movie was the best comic book adaptation in many years, if not of all time and none of the characters were dumbed down to one-dimensional characters.There are some interesting messages of how such great power and control also come with the need for great responsibility and it really is something to think about and I feel that those messages combined with fun action scenes in ""Spider Man"" make it a marvelous movie that is definitely miles above a lot of similar superhero movies or weak superhero movie additions that are sunk down by the MTV-oriented sequences, most notably ""Batman & Robin"". I think that this movie while occasionally flawed in some areas, ""Spider-Man"" was much better adapted to the big screen than the X-Men movie was. Unlike some of the characters of that great movie like Storm, Rogue, and Cyclops who I feel were reduced to middle of the road characters, the characters of ""Spider Man"" almost are as engaging and as great as their comic book incarnations and not since the 1989 ""Batman"" movie has a superhero comic and it's villains been so well adapted to the silver screen and that my friend is the definition of smart timing, great script and a movie that is destined to become a classic for many years to come, if not timeless. I just hope that the ""Spider-Man"" movie franchise will go for a long time and not be soiled into MTV oblivion like the Batman series was with ""Batman & Robin"". Let's just make sure that Joel Schumacher stays far away from this franchise.Let's just say that while these past few years have been dull and sometimes awful for music, they've also been great years for movies. Lord Of The Rings, Harry Potter, Shrek, Monsters Inc......you name it. ""Spider Man"" took as long as a decade to finally bring to the big screen but it all paid off though. While this movie might have some room for improvement, ""Spider Man"" is about as great as comic book movie filmmaking gets with its fun atmosphere and eye-popping action sequences and wonderful script and all of these things bring this movie to life. Let me tell you, I haven't seen any comic book characters that were brought to so much life on the big screen in my life. While I'm not knocking on the ""X-Men"" movie at all, ""Spider-Man"" was better filmed and the costumes were great and not overdone like some of the characters. Despite all of the negative flaws of both of these two movies, they are both classics and make a great action movie combo! Both make great compliments, ""Spider-Man"" having a fun and colorful mood yet dark atmosphere while ""X-Men"" has a darker and much more dramatic atmosphere and these two are great movies to include side by side. Perhaps they should eventually put together a movie where ""Spider Man"" meets the ""X-Men"" and they battle a Magneto-Dr. Octopus alliance. Now that would be awesome! Enough of all of that, ""Spider Man"" is a must-have addition to any movie-goers movie collection. I may be wrong but it might be difficult in my opinion for the second Spider Man movie to surpass this one but time will tell though. Go and buy it!

Most importantly, it is a fun, kinetic movie that doesn't let up.The most successful element of Spider-Man is its inspired choices in personnel.  Director Sam Raimi brings his manic visualization skills to the film, making Spidey's famous &quot;webswinging&quot; as exciting as they can be, without undue showing off.  And the casting is simply brilliant.  Tobey Maguire was made for this role.  Not only does he nail the physical elements (his transformation from thin bookworm to stringily muscular acrobat, the shyness and awkwardness), but he is especially marvellous at expressing Spidey's chatty, self-deprecatory sense of humour.  The best performance of his career so far.  Kirsten Dunst was a terrific choice for Mary Jane -- while she is sometimes saddled with cheesy scenes (the final scene at the cemetary being especially disappointing), Dunst is never less than lovable.  And her kiss in the rain with an upside-down Spider-Man is probably the sexiest moment in movies this year!  Willem Dafoe deserves more screen time as Green Goblin; Dafoe is more than good enough as an actor to craft a character akin to The Joker in Tim Burton's Batman, but the script, by red-hot screenwriter David Koepp (Mission:  Impossible, The Panic Room) doesn't really allow him to explore the character's depths.  That appears to be a conscious chioce on Koepp and Raimi's part to keep the focus squarely on Peter Parker/Spider-Man, so it's forgiveable.  The one weak link is James Franco (City by the Sea), who plays Peter's best friend completely at face value, seemingly addicted to a furrowed-eyebrow expression to try to show internal turmoil but falling flat on his face.The comedic elements are delightful; the origins of Spider-Man's name is a hoot, as are his interactions with Mary Jane and the Daily Bugle.  The overall sense of fun is infectious, and the story moves along briskly enough that there are never any dull moments.A great movie for sheer entertainment.",4,What big-budget adventures should be.,1037232000,"11 14, 2002",2002,2098,"['Spider-Man', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'important', 'things', 'right', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'weaker', 'points', 'Most', 'importantly', 'fun', 'kinetic', 'movie', ""n't"", 'let', 'up.The', 'most', 'successful', 'element', 'Spider-Man', 'inspired', 'choices', 'personnel', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'manic', 'visualization', 'skills', 'film', 'making', 'Spidey', 'famous', 'quot', 'webswinging', 'quot', 'as', 'exciting', 'can', 'be', 'undue', 'showing', 'off', 'casting', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'was', 'made', 'role', 'Not', 'only', 'nail', 'physical', 'elements', 'transformation', 'thin', 'bookworm', 'stringily', 'muscular', 'acrobat', 'shyness', 'awkwardness', 'especially', 'marvellous', 'expressing', 'Spidey', 'chatty', 'self-deprecatory', 'sense', 'humour', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'so', 'far', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'was', 'terrific', 'choice', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'sometimes', 'saddled', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'final', 'scene', 'cemetary', 'being', 'especially', 'disappointing', 'Dunst', 'never', 'less', 'lovable', 'kiss', 'rain', 'upside-down', 'Spider-Man', 'probably', 'sexiest', 'moment', 'movies', 'year', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Dafoe', 'more', 'good', 'enough', 'actor', 'craft', 'character', 'akin', 'Joker', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Batman', 'script', 'red-hot', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Koepp', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Panic', 'Room', ""n't"", 'really', 'allow', 'explore', 'character', 'depths', 'be', 'conscious', 'chioce', 'Koepp', 'Raimi', 'part', 'keep', 'focus', 'squarely', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider-Man', 'forgiveable', 'one', 'weak', 'link', 'James', 'Franco', 'City', 'Sea', 'who', 'Peter', 'best', 'friend', 'completely', 'face', 'value', 'seemingly', 'addicted', 'furrowed-eyebrow', 'expression', 'try', 'show', 'internal', 'turmoil', 'falling', 'flat', 'face.The', 'comedic', 'elements', 'are', 'delightful', 'origins', 'Spider-Man', 'name', 'hoot', 'are', 'interactions', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Daily', 'Bugle', 'overall', 'sense', 'fun', 'infectious', 'story', 'moves', 'briskly', 'are', 'never', 'dull', 'moments.A', 'great', 'movie', 'sheer', 'entertainment']",N/A

Though regarding this film, I found Tobey Maguire very likeable, very true to the original concept of Peter Parker, who was always a regular kid and never the typical, blue-eyed, 6 foot, muscle-choked Superhero. I think Kirsten Dunst is alright, but I don't really like her. Her MJ character never really likes Peter, and only comes around to him after noticing how nice he looks. Willem Dafoe is very creepy-looking, though the writing for him was too goofy and stupid. There are many, many humorous moments, most do not come from Spider-Man's mouth. There's a ridiculous scene where Aunt May relates to Peter how he mistook MJ for an angel. And another where she goes crazy in a hospital exclaiming, &quot;Those horrible yellow eyes!&quot; So this is a funny, funny movie, best suited to laughing at it in the back row.  Green Goblin is even goofier, thanks to his lines and costume. Another humorous aspect is how the paper says the wrestling arena requires colorful characters, and then he gets there and everyone is dressed completely in black! They really should have included the beautiful WTC teaser trailer on this DVD, which can be found online. I also like the nod to the comic books in the supplemental materials. Stan Lee's cameo should have been more than a mili-second. The backbone of all of this is fashioned into a very typical story, he evens runs to catch the bus exactly like Forrest Gump and the Goblin asks him to 'join' him, exactly like Darth Vader. Spider-Man should have been a much more original story, elements should have been better. I adore the ending with MJ and Peter, but she mentions his whole name repeatedly and so unnaturally. You do feel for the characters well enough, though. The CGI is sometimes wretched, but towards the end  it has a great scene, I just think all the CGI shots should have been like that all the way through the film, but I guess they were saving money.

585005,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B00005JKCH,Draconis Blackthorne,"[2, 3]","From the pages of comic book legend, another hero materializes into the third dimension to ooh and ahh the masses with super-human abilities, to wish for a super hero in such proportions of terrorist pre-occupation. And indeed, the war propaganda was made evident in the closing scene where the webslinger was perched atop a flag pole demonstrating Olde Glory, which received a few handclaps of approval from the audience.Besides this, I was accompanied by some friends to accompany them to this film - so being that I have had an affinity for the webhead since a Dracling, I decided to go. Rememberences of going to the corner store picking up copies of The Amazing Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk, X-men, any of the Draculas I could find; and there was even a time when I went through a Superman phase {Note: Superman was actually inspired by the ideologies of Friederich Nietchzie, in his philosophies of the ""Ubermenchten"" or ""Overman"" / ""superman""}; so it afforded Me particular interest to view this film.Sam Raimi {The Evil Dead trilogy, Darkman} kept as close to the story as possible, so as to not disappoint discerning Spidey fans with minor modifications {such as the spider which bit Peter Parker was actually a mutated clone, which seems more timely, whereas the original story related that it was a radio-active spider}, yet these small changes do not really distract from the overall wonder of the character. CGI technology has advanced to the point where the spider stunts can now be brought into the 3D realm, whereas prevoiusly, Spiderman presentations were primarily relegated to either pure animation, or when actually using an actor, as on the short-lived television series, certain shots were made from a distance and whatnot, although that presentation seemed to have more of an air of believability, only because stuntmen were used more frequently.The only contention this writer had, was with the CGI in this particular presentation; was in the kinematics of the fluency of the character during swinging sequences, which was just a bit too animatronic. Yet again, these are small details that can be overlooked for the overall super hero drama of The Amazing Spiderman.Raimi also decided to use the original portrayal of web shooting directly from Spiderman's wrists, rather than from the eventual web-shooters added in subsequent evolutions of The Spiderman Saga.The Green Goblin {William Defoe} was quie impressive as well; the product of experimental radiation, he in encased in sinister armor bearing a demonic rictus, wihch also serves as a mirror / doorway to his dark subconscious in which his diabolical personality split speak to him in 360*, which gives the impression of possession; but the higher man wouls realize this as one's collective dark-side consciosness of the brain's expression of possiblities.The Prodicer decided to use a mask instead of the anthropomorphic face used int he comic book scenario, and for these purposes, I think it worked quite well. The goblin mask represents an archetype of villainy, and in this Satanist's opinion, is well-hewn.Of note, the Mary-Jane Watson character {who is a ditz in real life}, in one remarkable scene, during a kiss sequence she shares with the webslinger, the outline of her nipples and breasts are revelaed drenched in the rain underneath a white blouse - which was quite a delightful surprise, really.There is a touching scene with Peter's uncle really tugs at the heart-strings, in which he was shot by a mugger who exited the very same event Parker was wrestling at, even brushing past him in a getaway, stealing from an unscrupulous promoter {spidey fans will be very familiar with these events} - both the promoter and the thief receive dark justice.Overall, this film is definitely recommended for the Spiderman fan, who should not be disappointed; and for those new to the homosapien-arachnid's lore, this will prove to be a worthy introduction.",5,Sticky situations...,1091836800,"08 7, 2004",2004,3944,"['pages', 'comic', 'book', 'legend', 'hero', 'third', 'dimension', 'ooh', 'ahh', 'masses', 'super-human', 'abilities', 'wish', 'super', 'hero', 'such', 'proportions', 'terrorist', 'pre-occupation', 'indeed', 'war', 'propaganda', 'was', 'made', 'evident', 'closing', 'scene', 'where', 'webslinger', 'was', 'perched', 'flag', 'pole', 'demonstrating', 'Olde', 'Glory', 'received', 'few', 'handclaps', 'approval', 'audience.Besides', 'was', 'accompanied', 'friends', 'accompany', 'film', 'so', 'being', 'have', 'had', 'affinity', 'webhead', 'Dracling', 'decided', 'go', 'Rememberences', 'going', 'corner', 'store', 'picking', 'up', 'copies', 'Amazing', 'Spiderman', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'X-men', 'Draculas', 'could', 'find', 'was', 'even', 'time', 'when', 'went', 'Superman', 'phase', 'Note', 'Superman', 'was', 'actually', 'inspired', 'ideologies', 'Friederich', 'Nietchzie', 'philosophies', 'Ubermenchten', 'Overman', '/', 'superman', 'afforded', 'Me', 'particular', 'interest', 'view', 'film.Sam', 'Raimi', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'trilogy', 'Darkman', 'kept', 'as', 'close', 'story', 'possible', 'so', 'not', 'disappoint', 'discerning', 'Spidey', 'fans', 'minor', 'modifications', 'such', 'spider', 'bit', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'was', 'actually', 'mutated', 'clone', 'more', 'timely', 'original', 'story', 'related', 'was', 'radio-active', 'spider', 'yet', 'small', 'changes', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'distract', 'overall', 'wonder', 'character', 'CGI', 'technology', 'advanced', 'point', 'where', 'spider', 'stunts', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'brought', '3D', 'realm', 'whereas', 'prevoiusly', 'Spiderman', 'presentations', 'were', 'primarily', 'relegated', 'pure', 'animation', 'when', 'actually', 'using', 'actor', 'short-lived', 'television', 'series', 'certain', 'shots', 'were', 'made', 'distance', 'whatnot', 'presentation', 'seemed', 'have', 'more', 'air', 'believability', 'only', 'stuntmen', 'were', 'used', 'more', 'frequently.The', 'only', 'contention', 'writer', 'had', 'was', 'CGI', 'particular', 'presentation', 'was', 'kinematics', 'fluency', 'character', 'swinging', 'sequences', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'animatronic', 'again', 'are', 'small', 'details', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'overall', 'super', 'hero', 'drama', 'Amazing', 'Spiderman.Raimi', 'also', 'decided', 'use', 'original', 'portrayal', 'web', 'shooting', 'directly', 'Spiderman', 'wrists', 'rather', 'eventual', 'web-shooters', 'added', 'subsequent', 'evolutions', 'Spiderman', 'Saga.The', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'William', 'Defoe', 'was', 'quie', 'impressive', 'well', 'product', 'experimental', 'radiation', 'encased', 'sinister', 'armor', 'bearing', 'demonic', 'rictus', 'wihch', 'also', 'mirror', 'doorway', 'dark', 'subconscious', 'diabolical', 'personality', 'split', 'speak', '360*', 'impression', 'possession', 'higher', 'man', 'realize', 'one', 'collective', 'dark-side', 'consciosness', 'brain', 'expression', 'possiblities.The', 'Prodicer', 'decided', 'use', 'mask', 'instead', 'anthropomorphic', 'face', 'used', 'int', 'comic', 'book', 'scenario', 'purposes', 'think', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'goblin', 'mask', 'archetype', 'villainy', 'Satanist', 'opinion', 'well-hewn.Of', 'note', 'Mary-Jane', 'Watson', 'character', 'who', 'ditz', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'remarkable', 'scene', 'kiss', 'sequence', 'shares', 'webslinger', 'outline', 'nipples', 'breasts', 'are', 'revelaed', 'drenched', 'rain', 'white', 'blouse', 'was', 'quite', 'delightful', 'surprise', 'touching', 'scene', 'Peter', 'uncle', 'really', 'heart-strings', 'was', 'shot', 'mugger', 'who', 'exited', 'very', 'same', 'event', 'Parker', 'was', 'wrestling', 'even', 'brushing', 'getaway', 'stealing', 'unscrupulous', 'promoter', 'spidey', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'familiar', 'events', 'promoter', 'thief', 'receive', 'dark', 'justice.Overall', 'film', 'definitely', 'recommended', 'Spiderman', 'fan', 'who', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'new', 'homosapien-arachnid', 'lore', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'worthy', 'introduction']",N/A
585006,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B00005JKCH,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[0, 1]","This is, in my mind, the single greatest Superhero movie ever made. The only one that comes close is the original Christopher Reeve SUPERMAN of the late 1970s. The film is action-packed, and yet it has a heart. The special effects are awesome eye-candy, but are far from the sole reason to buy this DVD.The forte of this endeavor is that it succeeds where so many Superhero movies have failed: it humanizes a young man who has almost omnipotent powers. Tobey Maguire is a credible Peter Parker, and this movie is almost more about Peter Parker than it is Spiderman. The biggest flaw of most Superhero efforts is that they pay too much attention to the hero and too little attention to the hero's secret identity.Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as the object of Parker's infatuation. She has an adorable girl-next-door beauty as opposed to a glamorous / COSMOPOLITAN magazine-cover look. In short, this is precisely what the film needs as Dunst's character is the symbolic all-American sweetheart that so many of us guys fall in love with in high school - but are never able to actually date.Willem Dafoe is, quite simply, the greatest Super-villain of all time. Sure, Gene Hackman was great as Lex Luthor and Jack Nicholson was memorable as the Joker, but Dafoe is utterly PERFECT as the Green Goblin. What's more, as is the case with Spiderman, the film does a remarkable job of humanizing his character as well. This is perhaps the least comic-booky seeming villian I've ever seen, despite the fact that they pulled the Goblin straight from the pages of a comic book!I cannot say enough about just how well-done this movie is. The soundtrack, courtesy of Danny Elfman, is outstanding. The direction is terrific, as is the acting. As an added bonus, the 2nd disc offers commentary and backdrop material of both the comic strip as well as the movie.  Most significant is an interview with the creator of SPIDERMAN himself:  Stan Lee.  It was terrific to see that he had a big hand in the writing and production of SPIDERMAN.The symmetry and length of the film are right on the money. The attack by some movie critics that the movie was too long is nothing short of ludicrous. It had just the right mix of the stories of the Goblin and Spiderman, enough grand standoffs + some mini-adventures along the way.The author C.S. Lewis once made the straightforward and yet trenchent observation that one should never critique a literary work that belongs to a genre that he dislikes. The same holds true for movies. If you don't like Superhero movies, you're most likely not going to like this one, for a Superhero movie is what it is. However, if you do enjoy Superhero films now & again, I can't imagine you NOT liking this production.The majority of movie critics who gave this film a poor rating did so not because it's a bad movie, but because they don't care for Superhero films. That is their prerogative, of course, but it also nullifies their tirades. After all, you can't ""blame"" a film for being of the genre it belongs to.As I walked out of the theatre as the credits rolled, I felt remarkably ""ordinary"" and mundane.  I cannot give a greater compliment to a movie of the Superhero genre, for that is precisely what you should feel like after viewing a story such as this.SPIDERMAN ROCKS!",5,We are who we choose to be.,1043539200,"01 26, 2003",2003,3288,"['mind', 'single', 'greatest', 'Superhero', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'only', 'one', 'close', 'original', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'SUPERMAN', 'late', '1970s', 'film', 'action-packed', 'yet', 'heart', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'awesome', 'eye-candy', 'are', 'far', 'sole', 'reason', 'buy', 'DVD.The', 'forte', 'endeavor', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'Superhero', 'movies', 'have', 'failed', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'almost', 'omnipotent', 'powers', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'credible', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'movie', 'almost', 'more', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Spiderman', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'most', 'Superhero', 'efforts', 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'hero', 'too', 'little', 'attention', 'hero', 'secret', 'identity.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'wonderful', 'object', 'Parker', 'infatuation', 'adorable', 'girl-next-door', 'beauty', 'opposed', 'glamorous', '/', 'COSMOPOLITAN', 'magazine-cover', 'look', 'short', 'precisely', 'what', 'film', 'Dunst', 'character', 'symbolic', 'all-American', 'sweetheart', 'so', 'many', 'guys', 'fall', 'love', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'never', 'able', 'actually', 'date.Willem', 'Dafoe', 'quite', 'simply', 'greatest', 'Super-villain', 'time', 'Sure', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'was', 'great', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'was', 'memorable', 'Joker', 'Dafoe', 'utterly', 'PERFECT', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'What', 'more', 'case', 'Spiderman', 'film', 'remarkable', 'job', 'humanizing', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'perhaps', 'least', 'comic-booky', 'seeming', 'villian', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'fact', 'pulled', 'Goblin', 'straight', 'pages', 'comic', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'about', 'just', 'how', 'well-done', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'courtesy', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'outstanding', 'direction', 'terrific', 'acting', 'added', 'bonus', '2nd', 'disc', 'offers', 'commentary', 'backdrop', 'material', 'comic', 'strip', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'Most', 'significant', 'interview', 'creator', 'SPIDERMAN', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'was', 'terrific', 'see', 'had', 'big', 'hand', 'writing', 'production', 'SPIDERMAN.The', 'symmetry', 'length', 'film', 'are', 'right', 'money', 'attack', 'movie', 'critics', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'nothing', 'short', 'ludicrous', 'had', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'stories', 'Goblin', 'Spiderman', 'enough', 'grand', 'standoffs', '+', 'mini-adventures', 'way.The', 'author', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'once', 'made', 'straightforward', 'yet', 'trenchent', 'observation', 'one', 'should', 'never', 'critique', 'literary', 'work', 'genre', 'same', 'true', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Superhero', 'movies', ""'re"", 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'going', 'like', 'one', 'Superhero', 'movie', 'what', 'However', 'do', 'enjoy', 'Superhero', 'films', 'now', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'NOT', 'liking', 'production.The', 'majority', 'movie', 'critics', 'who', 'gave', 'film', 'poor', 'rating', 'did', 'so', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Superhero', 'films', 'prerogative', 'course', 'also', 'tirades', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'film', 'being', 'genre', 'to.As', 'walked', 'theatre', 'credits', 'rolled', 'felt', 'remarkably', 'ordinary', 'mundane', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'greater', 'compliment', 'movie', 'Superhero', 'genre', 'precisely', 'what', 'should', 'feel', 'viewing', 'story', 'such', 'this.SPIDERMAN', 'ROCKS']",N/A

It's got great characters, action, acting and heart, it's one of the best popcorn flicks you'll ever see. Tobey McGuire may not be the wisecracking Spidey we know from the comic books, but he is completely believable as the young teen with these strange new powers. Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Green Goblin even if the Goblin design could have been a little better. I also loved J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Dunst, Robertson and Harris are great as M.J. and Uncle Ben and Aunt May.Sure there could have been a lot more development with Parker getting used to his new powers, but I believe this series was known to be a trilogy right from the get go and Raimi wanted to make Spider Man 2 all about the problems that would come with these powers and as we all know he pulled that one off in spades. When you think about the genius of how the first film was handled with Parker not giving much thought to the dangers of his new found gifts, it's a really good choice to not have over emphasized that point. I also love the ending of the film which I know also made all the ladies big fans of this film. There is nothing quite so bitter sweet as unrequited love.

Tobey Maguire shines as Peter Parker/Spiderman, and Willem Dafoe lends a deft bit of psychosis and humanity to the role of the Green Goblin. Ditto Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and Rosemary Harris as Aunt  May. And special nods to to Cliff Robertson as the emphatic and sympathetic Uncle Ben. Yes, the Goblin's frozen gargoyle mask detracts from the insidious nature of the character, but other than that, this film never steps wrong. People have complained about the CGI effects. Phooey!!! Not since Superman caught the helicopter in one hand and Lois Lane in the other have I been so captivated and exhilerated by the screen presence of a superhero!!! In fact, this is hands down the best comic adaptation since the original &quot;Superman.&quot; If you like Spidey, then prepare to be dazzled. This film gives me hope, because it effectively demonstrates that there are filmmakers out there who still can embody their characters with a sense of wonder and awe. That's the strength of this movie- it regards its titular character with a sense of wonder, something sorely lacking in, say, the depressing &quot;Batman&quot; franchise.

585017,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,B00005JKCH,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[1, 1]","""Good things come to all that wait"" works like a charm here.  One has to applaud the folks from Marvel for waiting until the right time to make this movie.  In their cash-strapped years, it had to be a huge temptation to accept any kind of money for the rights to their characters.  Had they went with a movie before the technology was ready, any effort would have been a big disappointment.  Had they not held out for a reasonable degree of integrity when it comes to the comic book origins it would have been a disaster.  But for once everybody did just about everything right, and the results are smashingly good.Most important, the plot sticks faithfully (and lovingly) to the now forty-year-old storyline.  We get the teen-aged orphan, raised by an aunt and uncle, getting bit by a special spider that transfers it's powers to the boy.  The boy at first uses his new-found powers frivolously, but is quickly sobered up big-time to the responsibilities he has somewhat inherited.  With few exceptions, the movie goes to great lengths to keep millions of fans happy.There were only a few big breaks from the storyline, and I have no problem with them.  The books had him bitten by a radioactive spider, the movie has a genetically altered spider.  Big deal.  A bigger, more important difference is the fact that the movie Spiderman's body produces it's own webbing, while the book has him shooting web cartridges that he invented himself.  I like the new way much better, as it stretches credibility to think that the teenager could all of a sudden invent this miracle product, AND need to store hundreds of cartridges around the city as replacements.Casting is as perfect as can be.  I had thought a younger Tom Cruise would be a great Peter Parker, but Toby Maguire now owns the role, showing the shyness and vulnerability of the character perfectly.  I had thought Kirsten Dunst not voluptuous enough to be Mary Jane, but just getting her wet removed all doubts.  The portrayals of J. Jonah Jameson, Uncle Ben, Aunt May, and Harry Osborne are also done well.Special effects are the only place I have problems.  The biggest is this stupid plastic mask worn by villian Green Goblin.  It just looks dumb, and they should have somehow animated it.  Also, some of the action sequences go too fast to drink in.  But when you can see the magic, yes, it does look like he can crawl up walls and swing between buildings.  When he fights a group of criminals, the body language of his Spider-moves takes the care to show something beyond just human gymnastics.The movie does have something for everyone, and I hope everyone sees it to insure a string of Spiderman movies.  Very young children will like when the costumed folk are on screen, but get a little restless during adult dialog.  However, those generally not into comic books much (i.e., females), can follow the romantic line between Peter and Mary Jane, and for that matter, Spiderman and Mary Jane.  Tobey Maguire, just like Peter Parker, has lucked out big time with some pretty hot screen kisses.Of course, there are also those millions of fans, some that have waited almost forty years for this to happen, to finally get their due.

The type of Blockbuster that the people involved actually cared about making, and it shows.  The characters are so much fun, from the central trio of young adults--Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, young Spidey-in-the-making, James Franco as his best friend, the troubled Harry Osbourne, and Kirsten Dunst, perfect as the warm and friendly but slightly inaccessible girl-next-door, Mary-Jane Watson--to the great Willem Dafoe, hamming it up gorgeously as Harry's scientist father, a.k.a. The Green Goblin.  One of the funniest scenes is when a wounded Spidey gets a pep talk from the responsible Goblin, who sits conspiratorily beside him and taps the woozy Spidey's head to get his attention.  The screenplay is marvellously tongue-in-cheek, every frame is drenched in colour, and the whole film shows the signs of love that went into making it.

585021,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JKCH,Eric,"[1, 1]","Not too long ago, I was a rather avid fan of the Spider-Man comics, always anxiously awaiting each month to see what new catastrophe our webbed hero would have to face. I stopped keeping track of the stories after the &quot;clone saga&quot; mess, which is simply one of the worst cases of &quot;overblown&quot; I've ever read. Then I heard news about a Spider-Man movie, which quickly became reality. It was an event I was neither looking forward to nor dreading. Unsurprisingly, it's a movie that I felt neither unbridled enthusiasm for nor utter disdain. It's as middling as mediocre gets.High school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy amateur photographer who's bitten by a radioactive spider, consquently being endowed with arachnid-like powers. He has super-strength, can jump great distances, and maybe best of all, he's got a spider-sense that warns him of danger. With these new abilities, his first acts are only thinking of himself, generally trying to make as much money as possible with his strength and agility.But when Peter's uncle is killed by a robber, he realizes that &quot;with great power comes great responsiblity.&quot; Haunted by his uncle's death, he goes about as a crimefighter, dressed in a red and blue costume, calling himself Spider-Man. A new, even more powerful foe called the Green Goblin arrives on the NYC scene, causing a lot of destruction in hopes of...well, that's not really clear. Meanwhile, Peter has to balance out his crimefighting with his personal lives, particularly with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), a redhead he's got a crush on.The very core of Spider-Man's biggest problem is its casting. While Willem Dafoe is terrific as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin and J.K. Simmons is a wonderful J. Jonah Jameson, almost every major character is miscast. Tobey Maguire is a mixed bag as Peter Parker. When he concentrates on the dilemma of the mixed lives he has to juggle on-screen alone (or with Dafoe), he's very good, but comes across totally flat when he actually interacts with his co-stars, particularly James Franco and Kirsten Dunst.Speaking of Franco and Dunst, how can these two be so charmless and without emotion? Franco does little more than brood, making one wonder why the more chipper Parker would even hang out with such a guy in the first place (Harry Osbourne was different personality-wise in the comics). Kirsten Dunst is the worst bit of comic book-to-film miscasting since George Clooney as Batman. Mary Jane Watson, arguably the most important character in Parker's life, is now little more than a grating redhead who lacks a discernable personality beyond constant superhero doting.For all that's wrong with the portrayal of those major characters, the origin story is really rather well done. Truth be told, I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit until Parker suited up as Spider-Man. The character's first CGI appearance is just a total distraction. Perhaps it was unavoidable, but the action scenes look more like cartoons than physical, death-defying showdowns. Unconvincing CGI was probably inevitble, but that doesn't mean I have to accept it.The movie also blows it in regards to the Green Goblin's motives. True, he initially wanted revenge against the board members that voted against him, but what about after that? Maybe the Goblin aspect of Osbourne's personality is power-hungry, but then again, all the Goblin ever does is blow stuff up. Maybe he just likes to see stuff blow up. If so, that's one of the laziest and lousiest villainous motives I've heard to date.Truthfully, not every aspect of the movie's central story or the action is as bad as I make it out to be. (moderate spoiler in this sentence) The dichotomy of the hero and villain is fairly interesting and their final mano-a-mano to the death is rather rousing, even if it ends on an idiotic note (was the Goblin trying to intentionally kill himself in the process of killing Spider-Man?)(he didn't have to get up like he did). But damn, those goofy CGI stuntmen and half-bad acting really put a downer on what should have been an exciting and touching summer blockbuster.** 1/2 out of *****",2,"Ruined by miscasting, creaky plotting, and bad CGI.",1080518400,"03 29, 2004",2004,4156,"['Not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'was', 'rather', 'avid', 'fan', 'Spider-Man', 'comics', 'always', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'month', 'see', 'what', 'new', 'catastrophe', 'webbed', 'hero', 'would', 'have', 'face', 'stopped', 'keeping', 'track', 'stories', 'quot', 'clone', 'saga', 'quot', 'mess', 'simply', 'one', 'worst', 'cases', 'quot', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'Then', 'heard', 'news', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'quickly', 'became', 'reality', 'was', 'event', 'was', 'neither', 'looking', 'forward', 'dreading', 'Unsurprisingly', 'movie', 'felt', 'unbridled', 'enthusiasm', 'utter', 'disdain', 'as', 'middling', 'mediocre', 'gets.High', 'school', 'student', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'nerdy', 'amateur', 'photographer', 'who', 'bitten', 'radioactive', 'spider', 'consquently', 'being', 'endowed', 'arachnid-like', 'powers', 'super-strength', 'can', 'jump', 'great', 'distances', 'maybe', 'best', 'got', 'spider-sense', 'danger', 'new', 'abilities', 'first', 'acts', 'are', 'only', 'thinking', 'generally', 'trying', 'make', 'much', 'money', 'possible', 'strength', 'agility.But', 'when', 'Peter', 'uncle', 'killed', 'robber', 'quot', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsiblity.', 'quot', 'Haunted', 'uncle', 'death', 'about', 'crimefighter', 'dressed', 'red', 'blue', 'costume', 'calling', 'Spider-Man', 'A', 'new', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'foe', 'called', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'NYC', 'scene', 'causing', 'lot', 'destruction', 'hopes', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'clear', 'Meanwhile', 'Peter', 'balance', 'out', 'crimefighting', 'personal', 'lives', 'particularly', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'redhead', 'got', 'crush', 'on.The', 'very', 'core', 'Spider-Man', 'biggest', 'problem', 'casting', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'terrific', 'Norman', 'Osbourne/Green', 'Goblin', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'wonderful', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'almost', 'major', 'character', 'miscast', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'When', 'dilemma', 'mixed', 'juggle', 'on-screen', 'alone', 'Dafoe', 'very', 'good', 'across', 'totally', 'flat', 'when', 'actually', 'co-stars', 'particularly', 'James', 'Franco', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst.Speaking', 'Franco', 'Dunst', 'how', 'can', 'two', 'be', 'so', 'charmless', 'emotion', 'Franco', 'little', 'more', 'brood', 'making', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'more', 'chipper', 'Parker', 'would', 'even', 'hang', 'out', 'guy', 'first', 'place', 'Harry', 'Osbourne', 'was', 'different', 'personality-wise', 'comics', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'worst', 'bit', 'comic', 'book-to-film', 'miscasting', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Batman', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'arguably', 'most', 'important', 'character', 'Parker', 'life', 'now', 'little', 'more', 'grating', 'redhead', 'who', 'discernable', 'personality', 'constant', 'superhero', 'doting.For', 'wrong', 'portrayal', 'major', 'characters', 'origin', 'story', 'really', 'rather', 'well', 'done', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'Parker', 'suited', 'up', 'Spider-Man', 'character', 'first', 'CGI', 'appearance', 'just', 'total', 'distraction', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'unavoidable', 'action', 'scenes', 'look', 'more', 'cartoons', 'physical', 'death-defying', 'showdowns', 'Unconvincing', 'CGI', 'was', 'probably', 'inevitble', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'accept', 'it.The', 'movie', 'also', 'regards', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'motives', 'True', 'initially', 'wanted', 'revenge', 'board', 'members', 'voted', 'what', 'Maybe', 'Goblin', 'aspect', 'Osbourne', 'personality', 'power-hungry', 'then', 'again', 'Goblin', 'ever', 'blow', 'stuff', 'up', 'Maybe', 'just', 'see', 'stuff', 'blow', 'up', 'so', 'one', 'laziest', 'lousiest', 'villainous', 'motives', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'date.Truthfully', 'not', 'aspect', 'movie', 'central', 'story', 'action', 'as', 'bad', 'make', 'be', 'moderate', 'spoiler', 'sentence', 'dichotomy', 'hero', 'villain', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'final', 'mano-a-mano', 'death', 'rather', 'rousing', 'even', 'idiotic', 'note', 'was', 'Goblin', 'trying', 'intentionally', 'kill', 'process', 'killing', 'Spider-Man', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'get', 'up', 'did', 'damn', 'goofy', 'CGI', 'stuntmen', 'half-bad', 'acting', 'really', 'put', 'downer', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'exciting', 'touching', 'summer', 'blockbuster', '**', '1/2', '*****']",N/A

The action in the movie is there, and like the comic there's a lot of ""slow"" drama between the action.  Out of a 2-hour movie (including the credits), there is about 20-30 minutes of action.  The rest is characters taking to each other, and making pleasantries.  One of the other reviews I read here is about the Green Goblin.  It states that Mr. Defoe is hidden behind a mask that doesn't move when he talks, etc.  While this is true, if you pay attention you can see his mouth behind the mask, so it does not detract from his acting abilites or your enjoyment of the film.

This movie portrays the great works of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko who made Spider-Man into an ever-popular comic book while making Marvel Comics famous.A bite by a rare breed of spiders at the Columbia University science lab gives Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) great vision and a perfect body. He also is also given great agility to jump form large skyscrapers and spin webs from his wrist. Then he assumes the identity of Spider Man to fight off the evil Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe),  that terrorizes the city with a glider that drops several bombs at a time.  Spider-Man nearly loses his life while saving the life of his girlfriend, people who are being threatened to be killed by the Green Goblin, and many innocent people who he doesn't even know.Tobey Maguire, with the emotional lead role overcomes the tragic death of his beloved Uncle Ben, growth trauma's, doubts, sorrows, and fear, to save lives and become the city icon. Willem Dafoe's hystericals and split-personality suffered after a lab-experiment gone wrong make him be a friend one minute and the evil Green Goblin the next. Kirsten Dunst fits the role nicely as Peter's love Mary Jane. Even characters with smaller parts like Peter's Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), and his friend Harry (James Franco) are amazing.

The filmmakers must have become pretty good at wrangling this dynamic. The extras on the swinging new ""Spider-Man"" DVD -- pointedly segregated at one point into sections for the comic and the movie -- should appeal both to Spidey fans and serious film folk alike. The two-disc set is packed with extras that are well-organized and, for the most part, worth the effort to wade through.The movie looks fine, especially considering all the disc space devoted to extras. The DVD faithfully renders the feature's surprisingly restrained color scheme of rich reds (Spider-Man), algae greens (the Goblin) and golds (the ambers of the dawn sun hitting Manhattan). Images range from OK (the Parker household set) to spectacular (the shining scenes over Gotham). The amazing look of the trailers collection hints at the potential for a reference-quality DVD.Audio is Dolby Digital 5.1 only. The fun takes a while to get started, but the soundstage soon enough does a home invasion on the viewing room. Rear effects consistently keep listeners on edge, delivering a few solid jolts (the Green Goblin's flashback, for instance).Director Sam Raimi and co-producer Grant Curtis provide entertaining commentary, their talk paired with a separate session by producer Laura Ziskin and star Kirsten Dunst.Many producers waste their DVD commentary time playing straight men to creative talent; Ziskin offers a rare perspective on what it's like to be a working producer, playing the budget game for time and money.Dunst says her Mary Jane character probably hasn't figured out that Parker is the web crawler: ""She isn't that smart."" The actress' famous wet-shirt scene passes without comment, but she reveals that she shot a solo bedroom dance in her underwear that was cut (""It was a little too much"").Raimi's a DVD commentary veteran, always upbeat, offbeat and informative. He spends a lot of time crediting co-workers like the second unit directors, giving the scope of just how intensely collaborative modern action films are.The film has two huge effects scenes -- the Times Square clash between Spidey and the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and the concluding sequence of our hero swinging through Manhattan.

585029,AWZAYORFYJC1W,B00005JKCH,FMR,"[1, 5]","Question: What do you get when you try to cram nearly a decade worth of comic book history into a two hour superhero film, while at the same time ignoring elements unique to the origin of the superhero in question? Answer: This movie.When Sam Raimi was interviewed about this film he kept saying how much he loved the characters and how he was going to stay true to the spirit of the comic. But anyone who's familiar with the comic and the characters would be left to wonder what he meant after watching this travesty. The characters in this film bear little resemblance to their comic counterparts. Raimi took people and events as familiar to many of us as our own lives and changed them into something foreign and devoid of any spark of life. Not one of the major changes from comic to film was necessary, but were all done in the interests of having a modern approach and making it more believable. That was a pretty ambitious (and pointless) task for a movie based on a comic book wasn't it? Very little in a superhero comic could be considered believable, but we wanted to see the Spiderman we all knew brought to the big screen anyway. But Raimi couldn't be bothered to give us that, and treated us instead to HIS version of Spiderman.One of Raimi's biggest changes was not giving us Peter Parker the science whiz. It was his interest in the world of science that set him apart from his classmates who are more interested in being popular than in studying. In the comics Peter couldn't get the others to go with him to a science exhibit on radiation. It was his interest in science that drew him to that exhibit and it was there that the radioactive spider bit him. But in the film he is just one of many students on a class field trip. In the comics it was like it was almost fated to be him, but in the film it could just as easily have been anyone who became Spiderman.There is an interesting duality about Peter Parker. You could say that because of science he is a self made man. It made him both a good student and a superhero. His love of science defines him and hampers him at the same time. It allows him to get attention from his teachers but makes him an outcast with the other kids. Science gave him powers that allow him to do things that no one else can, but also caused him to be branded a menace. The kids at school like Spiderman but hate Peter. Adults like Peter but hate Spiderman. It's no real stretch to suggest that without science Peter Parker would be nothing. Peter couldn't have been a success as Spiderman without science. It is his life, and his knowledge of it saved him many times where his powers alone couldn't have. Peter's interest in science is an integral part of his character, but with the exception of a few passing comments it gets all but ignored in this film. Without that science background you diminish the character of Peter Parker and it certainly shows in this film.Raimi also changed the radioactive spider into a genetically altered spider. Back in the sixties radiation was an unknown to most people and could be used as a means to give Peter his powers. But a genetically altered ""super spider"" would be no more likely to give someone super powers than a radioactive one. How believable is it that these researchers would create just the right combination of changes in one of their spiders that it would turn Peter into Spiderman, but one altered by radiation couldn't? And does that mean that any of the spiders that were on display could have given him his powers had they bit him instead? If this is the case then you reduce Peter's accident to an almost trivial matter.Another complaint among many of the die-hard Spidey fans was the use of organic webbing. But when Raimi said that there would be a compromise for the fans it led me to suggest on a newsgroup that he would have to invent the web shooters to control and properly use this organic webbing, but this was not to be. Raimi's compromise was that Peter had to use the two fingers to the palm method for shooting his webs as he does in the comics. Some compromise. Raimi said it wasn't believable for a high school kid to invent webbing and web shooters. Is it believable that some children can play a musical instrument before they can read or write? It's hard to believe but it happens all the time. Some people are just born gifted, and in the case of Peter Parker his gift is science. But if that is too much to accept then how are we to accept that these organic web shooters conveniently show up on his arms (both of them) where he could use them? Why didn't they turn up on his back or the bottom of his feet? And are we to believe they would be so small, and that they would just grow on top of his skin and not from inside his arms displacing blood vessels, veins and muscle tissue as they did so? And how is Peter able to produce a giant web so quickly when real spiders have to construct their webs?But if these changes were made to make the film more believable then Raimi certainly fell down on the job in several other areas. In the film we see Peter accidentally shoot a web at a school lunch tray yet no one notices. He then drags that tray behind him with the webbing still attached to his arm in full view of the cafeteria. And a few minutes later he puts on a display of inhuman speed, agility and strength when fighting Flash Thompson. Is it believable that when Spiderman first appears a short time later that not one student might guess who he really is? Is it believable that a poor high school student with no job and no money could create such a complex costume? Peter didn't have the skills needed to design and assemble something like that or access to the machinery needed to do so. In the comics Spiderman's costume was made from a thin, lightweight material that he could comfortably wear under his clothes, that allowed him full range of movement. Does the movie costume look like it could do either of those?And why did Raimi feel the need to change the manner in which Uncle Ben died? In the comics when Uncle Ben is murdered at home Peter not only loses the man who helped raise him, but his sense of safety and shelter from the outside world as well. When his uncle's death happens in the only home he has ever know the comfortable little world that Peter lived in would forever be violated. But the film gave us a car jacking instead. Incredibly there were some on the Internet that actually said it was better this way. They felt it wasn't believable to have the burglar Peter let escape days later choose his house to rob. So how believable is it that of all the possible directions the burglar could have run and all the cars he could have chosen he picked the one that lead to Uncle Ben's death? It's worth pointing out that Uncle Ben wasn't in front of the building where Peter was wrestling but in front of the library where he let him off which was some distance away.And as for the Green Goblin what can I say. He isn't scary or even menacing. He is a dull one-dimensional character that looks like he should be fighting the Power Rangers instead of Spiderman. That helmet allows no emotion or personality to show through, and without that how could the audience be expected to identify with the character? He might as well have been a robot controlled by Osborn instead of Osborn himself. And where does he keep his weapons? The comic Goblin carried his stuff in a bag but the movie version seems to produce his from thin air. And why is there no investigation of Osborn after someone murders the people who publicly oppose him using his inventions? Not everyone who would have known of these events was killed, so why didn't a film so worried about believability give us a big scene showing Osborn under siege from both local and federal law enforcement agencies demanding answers?Tobey Maguire played Peter Parker as a mumbling lovesick wuss the entire film and he brought nothing to the role of Spiderman. Kirsten Dunst reduced Mary Jane to nothing more than a helpless girlfriend character and the ""wet T-shirt"" attempted assault scene was shameless and an insult to such a strong character. Willem Dafoe made a decent Norman Osborn but he never had anything to do. The part where Norman discovers Peter's secret was ridiculous and so was its presentation. The CGI suffered from many weak moments such as Peter jumping from roof to roof testing his new powers, and then later while chasing Uncle Ben's killer in his makeshift Spidey costume. And the scene where he stops the armored car robbery looked like something out of a video game.If you are looking for the classic Lee/Ditko Spiderman you won't find it here, but if you want to see a weepy teen drama that borrows from other superhero films then this is the movie for you.",1,Sam Raimi + bad casting + terrible script = this movie,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,8800,"['Question',

But after repeated viewings, the movie becomes a bit stale for me after awhile.The film's good points though are Tobey Maguire's solid potrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst as the lovely MJ. The bad points were the wearisome Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe was good though) and the pathetic dialogue this film has, especially by the villian. It was a bit long as well.I'm giving it four stars though because of the way it looked like when I first saw it. It was fun, somewhat exciting, and the performances were grand. And also because I like Sam Raimi, the director, because he made a favorite movie of mine before. It was DARKMAN. It was way better then SPIDER-MAN, but Raimi did a good job at building a comic-book atmosphere for this movie.Every kid in this world has flocked around this movie, which is a bit annoying for me.

It has only been a few years since it came out in theaters, but it is still as fun and spectacular as it was when I first watched it way back then. I have been a Spidey fan since the 80s, so he has always been a hero of mine, you can imagine the thrill I had when I finally got to see him on the big screen. Sam Raimi did an excellent job on this movie and it shows from beginning to end.Tobey McGuire is definitely the perfect choice to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He definitely brings the nerdiness out of Peter, but also brings the strength and courage of Spider-Man. You feel for the guy when a certain family member dies, and you cheer when he finally gets his revenge on those who hurt him and his family. With that said, I think the real movie star is Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin. He is an incredible actor and is always fun to see on screen. From his change in voice to his facial expressions when he is the Goblin, no wonder he has been kept for the sequels, he is just someone fun to watch.Overall, this is a movie that you have to see if you haven't already, whether you are a fan or not.

585034,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005JKCH,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 4]","I'm not generally enthusiastic about superheroes, comic book characters, or even special effects movies--but I have to say that SPIDERMAN is easily the best movie of its kind that I have ever seen, a movie that packs a tremendous whallop in terms of being just flat-out fun to watch.  The cast is solid; the story is entertaining; the special effects are first rate all the way.Unless you've been living in a hole all these years, you already recognize the character--one of the last to emerge from the golden age of comic books and still one of the most popular.  But Spiderman differs somewhat from most comic book superheroes: he is insecure, angst-ridden, and carries with him all the uncertainties of youth; consequently, the character foreshadowed the current wave of much darker comicbook characters, many of whom might be described as underdog anti-heroes.  While the film departs from the original comic book storyline in a number of ways, it retains that element.  And it follows the legend in general outline: Peter Parker is a brainy but slightly nerdy and insecure kid--but when he is bitten by a radioactive (in this case a genetically mutated) spider, he develops amazing powers.  And when crime hits home in a personal way, he sets out to rid the city of bad guys and comes face to face with supercriminal Green Goblin, who is determined to tempt Spiderman into a life or crime or kill him trying.I would have never imagined Tobey Maguire in the role of Spiderman, but he brings the right blend of uncertainty and joy in his newly discovered powers to the role, and as a result is a superhero character that is a lot more believable than most other big screen efforts.  Willen Dafoe, who has made a career of playing unexpected characters, is also perfectly cast as The Green Goblin, and the supporting cast--which includes Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris--is also extremely good.  The film moves at a good pace, alternately witty and actionpacked, touching and sharp.  And although the special effects are a bit dimmed by the translation to the small screen (I always find that CGI works better on the big screen), it is still fascinating stuff to watch.The double DVD set comes with a host of extras, including computer games, outtakes, and the like, but the most enjoyable of the extras are a documentary on the making of the film and a documentary re Marvel Comics with an emphasis (of course) on ""your friendly neighborhood Spiderman;"" frankly, bonus packages don't come much better.  Now, if you're not a comicbook or superhero fan, you might want to rent this one before you buy it; the fact that everything is on the surface (no seriously deep meanings here) is also likely to annoy people looking for depth.  But that aside, SPIDERMAN is just a tremendous amount of fun to watch from start to finish, and if you can enter into that spirit of fun you'll enjoy every minute of it.",5,A Genuine Blockbuster!,1044403200,"02 5, 2003",2003,2937,"[""'m"", 'not', 'generally', 'enthusiastic', 'superheroes', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'even', 'special', 'effects', 'movies', 'have', 'say', 'SPIDERMAN', 'easily', 'best', 'movie', 'kind', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'tremendous', 'whallop', 'terms', 'being', 'just', 'flat-out', 'fun', 'watch', 'cast', 'solid', 'story', 'entertaining', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'way.Unless', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'hole', 'years', 'already', 'recognize', 'character', 'one', 'last', 'emerge', 'golden', 'age', 'comic', 'books', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'Spiderman', 'differs', 'somewhat', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'superheroes', 'insecure', 'angst-ridden', 'uncertainties', 'youth', 'consequently', 'character', 'foreshadowed', 'current', 'wave', 'much', 'darker', 'comicbook', 'characters', 'many', 'whom', 'might', 'be', 'described', 'underdog', 'anti-heroes', 'film', 'departs', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'storyline', 'number', 'ways', 'element', 'legend', 'general', 'outline', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'brainy', 'slightly', 'nerdy', 'insecure', 'kid', 'when', 'bitten', 'radioactive', 'case', 'genetically', 'mutated', 'spider', 'amazing', 'powers', 'when', 'crime', 'home', 'personal', 'way', 'out', 'rid', 'city', 'bad', 'guys', 'face', 'face', 'supercriminal', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'who', 'determined', 'tempt', 'Spiderman', 'life', 'crime', 'kill', 'trying.I', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'imagined', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'role', 'Spiderman', 'right', 'blend', 'uncertainty', 'joy', 'newly', 'discovered', 'powers', 'role', 'result', 'superhero', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'believable', 'most', 'other', 'big', 'screen', 'efforts', 'Willen', 'Dafoe', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'unexpected', 'characters', 'also', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'James', 'Franco', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'also', 'extremely', 'good', 'film', 'moves', 'good', 'pace', 'alternately', 'witty', 'actionpacked', 'touching', 'sharp', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'bit', 'dimmed', 'translation', 'small', 'screen', 'always', 'find', 'CGI', 'better', 'big', 'screen', 'still', 'fascinating', 'stuff', 'watch.The', 'double', 'DVD', 'set', 'host', 'extras', 'including', 'computer', 'games', 'outtakes', 'like', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'extras', 'are', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'documentary', 're', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'emphasis', 'course', 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'Spiderman', 'frankly', 'bonus', 'packages', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'much', 'better', 'Now', ""'re"", 'not', 'comicbook', 'superhero', 'fan', 'might', 'want', 'rent', 'one', 'buy', 'fact', 'everything', 'surface', 'seriously', 'deep', 'meanings', 'here', 'also', 'likely', 'annoy', 'people', 'looking', 'depth', 'aside', 'SPIDERMAN', 'just', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'fun', 'watch', 'start', 'finish', 'can', 'enter', 'spirit', 'fun', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'minute']",N/A
585035,A3M5O6UHXO9IBU,B00005JKCH,Gary,"[5, 11]","Sam Raimi has made a subtly acted mainstream movie with 'The Gift', but unwisely returns to the style of 'Darkman' for this belated comic book adaption, presumably because he felt it worked a treat the first time. Arguably, it didn't, the stylised affectations failing to engage on that occasion, either. Perhaps it's too hard to translate the 'realism' of the 'Spiderman' strip to celluloid, and Raimi doesn't try. Also, it's too old a strip to successfully incorporate the anochronistic aspects within a contemporary setting. The film also suffers from the use of too much shorthand in attempting to cover ground in Mr Parker's eventful life, making us lose interest in the second half. The audience in the late show I saw frankly giggled through the cack-handed love scenes. Parker ultimately managed to juggle a private life with heroism in the strip, thus making his vow of celebacy in the feature perplexing to the viewer. The original's charm and intrigue came from it's campus setting and if not for 'Buffy', which covers similar ground, it might have worked better as a series. Certainly, the first two 'Superman' films handled this sort of material with more wit and aplomb. As it stands, the film has trouble competing against modern fare such as 'The Matrix'. Perhaps sensing this, the producers introduce some unnecessarily graphic violence into the proceedings. This is inappropriate in my view, not to mention emetic as the film so closely resembles 'Inspector Gadget' in it's childishness. A poor commercial decision too, as much of it's target audience are now excluded from viewing 'Spiderman' in the UK. The comic strip conformed to a voluntary comics code and was never that violent, if memory serves, thus adding to one's cynicism.Another aspect that disappoints is the lack of widescreen presentation. Surely, this picture was crying out for panoramic vistas of the city. I felt short changed, as I always do when confronted with this restricted aspect.I have to say this is a minority view, as the public and critics have largely embraced Raimi's approach to the material.",1,A shoddy and boring enterprise,1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,2095,"['Sam', 'Raimi', 'made', 'subtly', 'acted', 'mainstream', 'movie', ""'The"", 'Gift', 'unwisely', 'returns', 'style', ""'Darkman"", 'belated', 'comic', 'book', 'adaption', 'presumably', 'felt', 'worked', 'treat', 'first', 'time', 'Arguably', 'did', ""n't"", 'stylised', 'affectations', 'failing', 'engage', 'occasion', 'either', 'Perhaps', 'too', 'hard', 'translate', ""'realism"", ""'Spiderman"", 'strip', 'celluloid', 'Raimi', ""n't"", 'try', 'Also', 'too', 'old', 'strip', 'successfully', 'incorporate', 'anochronistic', 'aspects', 'contemporary', 'setting', 'film', 'also', 'use', 'too', 'much', 'shorthand', 'attempting', 'cover', 'ground', 'Mr', 'Parker', 'eventful', 'life', 'making', 'lose', 'interest', 'second', 'half', 'audience', 'late', 'show', 'saw', 'frankly', 'giggled', 'cack-handed', 'love', 'scenes', 'Parker', 'ultimately', 'managed', 'juggle', 'private', 'life', 'heroism', 'strip', 'thus', 'making', 'vow', 'celebacy', 'feature', 'perplexing', 'viewer', 'original', 'charm', 'intrigue', 'came', 'campus', 'setting', 'not', ""'Buffy"", 'similar', 'ground', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'series', 'Certainly', 'first', 'two', ""'Superman"", 'films', 'handled', 'sort', 'material', 'more', 'wit', 'aplomb', 'film', 'trouble', 'competing', 'modern', 'fare', 'such', ""'The"", 'Matrix', 'Perhaps', 'sensing', 'producers', 'introduce', 'unnecessarily', 'graphic', 'violence', 'proceedings', 'inappropriate', 'view', 'not', 'mention', 'emetic', 'film', 'so', 'closely', 'resembles', ""'Inspector"", 'Gadget', 'childishness', 'poor', 'commercial', 'decision', 'too', 'much', 'target', 'audience', 'are', 'now', 'excluded', 'viewing', ""'Spiderman"", 'UK', 'comic', 'strip', 'conformed', 'voluntary', 'comics', 'code', 'was', 'never', 'violent', 'memory', 'serves', 'thus', 'adding', 'one', 'cynicism.Another', 'aspect', 'disappoints', 'lack', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'Surely', 'picture', 'was', 'crying', 'out', 'panoramic', 'vistas', 'city', 'felt', 'short', 'changed', 'always', 'do', 'when', 'confronted', 'restricted', 'aspect.I', 'have', 'say', 'minority', 'view', 'public', 'critics', 'have', 'largely', 'embraced', 'Raimi', 'approach', 'material']",N/A

I'd get the Sunday paper comics section out and spread it on the floor and get down on my hands and knees and read the entire thing. Even Prince Valiant, although he'd come last. The first things were Superman, Dick Tracy and Batman. I loved super heroes and super bad guys. They were my favorites! I don't remember Spider-Man and it's possible that he didn't come along until later, or perhaps our paper just didn't have him included. Amazingly, a lot of these super heroes have stayed with us and now are on radio, television and in the movies. Well, I've seen a couple Batman movies and ""Superman Returns"" and I thought they were awful movies. These guys were much better as a part of my imagination!Well, the other day I picked up a Spider-Man movie (Spider-Man DVD Special Edition) off a deep discount shelf and I just had to see what it amounted to. Maybe it helped to have never read Spider-Man comics. In any case, the movie got off to an appealing start and about the first third was an enjoyable, if not somewhat touching, story.  Spider-Man (before transformation) was a teen-aged nerd and he lived next to a very pleasant and nice-looking young lady. They'd lived side by side for a number of years, but had never met. Alas, a reminder of my own shy and misspent youth. In any case, Nerd-Boy gets bitten by a spider and begins to take on some remarkable changes. It doesn't really get going until his Uncle (acting Father) gets killed and then the transformation into Spider-Man takes place in a rather short time. At this point, I quit watching the movie for the rather weak story and started watching it for the sets and remarkable animations.Hollywood is second to none when it comes to movies like this. I'm amazed! It's action, action, action as Spider_Man battles the Green Goblin. Biff, slam, crunch. Destroy this. Destroy that. The movie must have cost a fortune to make! The actors perform gymnastic feats far in excess of that any Olympic athlete could do. And do it in rapid sequential order. Well, you know Spider-Man is going to ultimately win, but who cares? Have you ever been to a Super-Hero movie where he/she didn't win? Alsa, the story is down the drain. I'm watching the wonderful stunts and animations. How do they ever do such things? Who cares about the story? There's an extra DVD (my Spider-Man is the Special Edition package) but I didn't watch it. Perhaps sometime in the future. I want to remain in awe at the marvelous technology, both in this movie and other movies like it. For me, the enjoyment is watching this thing unfold, not the story.Gary Peterson",5,Wonderful Stunts and Animations.

He is a borderline genius who can't handle a simple conversation with the girl next door who he has loved for years, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  He works on the school paper, has coke-bottle thick glasses, and is spindly at best.  No wonder he is the point of all cruel jokes.  One day when the school is touring a science lab they go through an exhibit where scientists are trying to genetically mutate spiders combine all the individual powerful attributes of spiders into one ""super-spider.""  Unfortunately they don't know that one is missing.  Parker finds it as it bites him on the hand.  The rest of the day is a blur as he feels himself getting more and more sick.  When he returns to his Aunt and Uncle's house that night he passes out and has strange dreams involving the spider.The next day things are different.  Peter finds he doesn't need his glasses and he appears to have gone from scrawny to having the body of a gymnist as he slept.  Stranger things are beginning to happen as his hands stick to things and a weird web-like substance is coming out of his wrist.  After he defeates the school bully in a joke of a fight he finds himself running in panic into an alley.  When he remembers the bite on his hand he begins to have an idea and, being the scientist that he hopes to be, he tries an experiment.  Before he knows it he is crawling up the side of a building and jumping the roof tops.  He is even learning how to shoot the webs from his wrist.Like most teen-agers who suddenly have power he decides that with a lot of money would come the girl of his dreams.  Parker enters a professional wrestling ring for an exhibition bout dressed as ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and promptly destroys the giant of a man.  Unfortunately things begin going to his head and he lets a robber get away from him with devestating consequences.  Suddenly he learns to his horror that, ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility.""  Parker uses a newly designed costume as well as increased skill with his powers to help the citizens of New York.Unfortunately Parker is not your average super-hero.  He isn't rich and doesn't have a trust fund so while battling crime on the side, he also has to find a place to live, get a job, see about getting into college, take care of his Aunt, and oh yeah...dare we forget that with the rise of a super-hero and villain is bound to appear?Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is the father of Parker's best friend.  He is rich, a brilliant inventor, and after ingesting a super-soldier type formula, quite insane.  Osborn dons the exo-skelton he had been designed for the military as well as stealing a glider and is quickly dubbed The Green Goblin by the press.  As we all know, the two will eventually battle.  The real question is how Parker is going to handle battling a villain who he frequently hangs out with for dinner when Norman drops by to see his son, Harry.This was really well-worth the wait.  Fans of the comic will really not have too many complaints.  Sure they have changed some things for simple continuity but nothing great has been changed.  People who haven't read the comic will also be able to follow this introductory story (since there will most certaintly be a sequel).Sam Raimi directs this with much of the style that he has done similar features previously with the Evil Dead series.  This has many dark tones but is also infused with the humor that helps move the story along.  There were a few slow moments but overall nothing that would cause the fans to lose interest.  The special effects are worth every penny that has been paid.  Certainly many things do look computer generated but it is done in such as style as to closely mimic the drawings that would appear in the comic.Casting was always a major worry in this movie.  Many people, such as myself, were worried to hear that Tobey Maguire had been cast.  Sure he had done a wonderful job in The Cider-House Rules and certainly he had held his own in the idiotic Wonder Boys, but casting him as Spider-Man???  Well, I have to apologize to Mr. Maguire because he certainly did a wonderful job hear.  He definitly was able to handle the dramatic moments and also carried more than a certain sly charm that allowed him to do the trade-mark quips that fans of Spider-Man have come to expect.  He also has spent an incredible amount of time with the personal trainers and that showed.  I for one will willingly back him for the sequels and hope that we don't have a fiasco similar to Batman with the actor changing each film.Willem Dafoe is probably ""the weakest link"" in the movie and that is more from the writing of his character than how he does.  I think that at times they made his acting a tad too comic-bookish if you will but that really wouldn't be his fault.I approached this movie with a certain amount of trepidation and yet enthusiastically.  Spider-Man is a comic-book hero that many can identify with since he seems to have the most human problems of them all.

585041,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00005JKCH,Get What We Give,"[0, 1]","Wow!Since Hollywood has gone completely creatively bankrupt, it seems that comics are the last bastion of ""new"" material for them to use for films.  Too often these films are very poor renditions of their comic counterpart:  Batman and Robin; The Fantastic Four; Spiderman TV series; The Punisher; Captain America; and Tank Girl.There's always room for creative license when transferring mediums, but what is often an overthought is the fan base.  Who goes to see comics to film?  Young adults and kids do.  What do they expect?  Well, they expect something worth their 9 or 10 bucks - that's what.Spiderman delivers a whole lot of film and a whole lot of fun for the money (Okay - so I still think films are waaaaay too expensive, but that's another story).Toby McGuire IS Peter Parker!  Rami cast the part (in fact all the parts) perfectly.  He was right on that it didn't matter who played Spiderman, because whoever it was would be completely disguised.  Peter Parker was the tough character to cast.  Willem DaFoe is excellent as the Green Goblin.How about the story?  It could not have been told more appropriately and succinctly than it is.  Basically, it is the original story from 1962 about how Peter Parker becomes imbued with superhuman powers to later become Spiderman.  Some have argued that Rami and the writers took too much liberty with the character by allowing his web-creation to be internal as opposed to manufactured by Peter.  I beg to differ.  I think that Rami et al made that aspect of the character BETTER than the comic version.Folks, this is a movie.  That said, it's a movie based on a beloved comic and its lead character - and I think that the movie is just about the best comic to film rendition ever done.  Marvel would do well to follow its own example from this film and use the same logic with the next XMen film and any subsequent comics to film made.Go see this film!",5,Top notch action film,1022112000,"05 23, 2002",2002,1906,"['Wow', 'Hollywood', 'gone', 'completely', 'creatively', 'bankrupt', 'comics', 'are', 'last', 'bastion', 'new', 'material', 'use', 'films', 'Too', 'often', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'poor', 'renditions', 'comic', 'counterpart', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Spiderman', 'TV', 'series', 'Punisher', 'Captain', 'America', 'Tank', 'Girl.There', 'always', 'room', 'creative', 'license', 'when', 'transferring', 'mediums', 'what', 'often', 'overthought', 'fan', 'base', 'Who', 'see', 'comics', 'film', 'Young', 'adults', 'kids', 'do', 'What', 'do', 'expect', 'Well', 'expect', 'something', 'worth', '9', '10', 'bucks', 'what.Spiderman', 'whole', 'lot', 'film', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'money', 'Okay', 'so', 'still', 'think', 'films', 'are', 'waaaaay', 'too', 'expensive', 'story', '.Toby', 'McGuire', 'IS', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Rami', 'cast', 'part', 'fact', 'parts', 'perfectly', 'was', 'right', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'who', 'played', 'Spiderman', 'whoever', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'disguised', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'was', 'tough', 'character', 'cast', 'Willem', 'DaFoe', 'excellent', 'Green', 'Goblin.How', 'story', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'more', 'appropriately', 'succinctly', 'Basically', 'original', 'story', '1962', 'how', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'imbued', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'later', 'become', 'Spiderman', 'have', 'argued', 'Rami', 'writers', 'took', 'too', 'much', 'liberty', 'character', 'allowing', 'web-creation', 'be', 'internal', 'opposed', 'manufactured', 'Peter', 'beg', 'differ', 'think', 'Rami', 'et', 'al', 'made', 'aspect', 'character', 'BETTER', 'comic', 'version.Folks', 'movie', 'said', 'movie', 'based', 'beloved', 'comic', 'lead', 'character', 'think', 'movie', 'just', 'best', 'comic', 'film', 'rendition', 'ever', 'done', 'Marvel', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'follow', 'own', 'example', 'film', 'use', 'same', 'logic', 'next', 'XMen', 'film', 'subsequent', 'comics', 'film', 'made.Go', 'see', 'film']",N/A

585048,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B00005JKCH,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[1, 1]","SPOILERS FOLLOW""Spider-Man"" is an awesome 2002 superhero film from Sony Pictures and Marvel Entertainment.  Starring Tobey Maguire, Willem Defoe, and Kirsten Dunst it pops off of the screen with action and also harbors a thought-provoking storyline.Directed by Sam Raimi and based on the comic book created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, ""Spider-Man"" is mostly exceptional.  Following an obligatory origin story for both hero and villain(Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider, while Norman Osborne essentially poisons himself in an experiment), the movie focuses on the choices Spider-Man makes which define him as the hero from the villainous Green Goblin.  At the center of the story is the call to do the right thing morally when often a path of least resistance seems easier.  In Spider-Man's case, the character is a teenager with enormous power and responsibility thrust on him.  Tobey Maguire plays the emotional conflict well.  As Spider-Man makes a decision to stand for goodness, the Green Goblin, the psychological id of Norman Osborne, consumes him.  There is a genuine tragic quality to the Green Goblin, because the good Norman Osborne regards Peter Parker as nothing less than a son.  This rankles his actual son(and Peter's best friend) Harry, played by James Franco, but that's a story for two other movies to tell.As Mary Jane Watson, Kirsten Dunst is intriguing playing a goodhearted character with a hard home life.  Ms. Dunst has obvious talent and a palpable chemistry with her two young male co-stars.The biggest mistake this movie makes is in costuming.  It is still a mystery to me why they chose to put Willlem Defoe in a metallic green suit as the Goblin.  I prefer the famous naturalistic Goblin of comic books and animation, but it's possible the filmmakers deemed that look too controversial and demonic.Also starring Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris, ""Spider-Man"" is one of the best comic book adaptations of the modern era.",4,Extremely good movie slightly downgraded for plastic presentation of its villain,1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,1967,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOW', 'Spider-Man', 'awesome', '2002', 'superhero', 'film', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Marvel', 'Entertainment', 'Starring', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'screen', 'action', 'also', 'thought-provoking', 'storyline.Directed', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'created', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'Spider-Man', 'mostly', 'exceptional', 'Following', 'obligatory', 'origin', 'story', 'hero', 'villain', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'bitten', 'radioactive', 'spider', 'Norman', 'Osborne', 'essentially', 'experiment', 'movie', 'choices', 'Spider-Man', 'define', 'hero', 'villainous', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'center', 'story', 'call', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'morally', 'when', 'often', 'path', 'least', 'resistance', 'easier', 'Spider-Man', 'case', 'character', 'teenager', 'enormous', 'power', 'responsibility', 'thrust', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'well', 'Spider-Man', 'decision', 'stand', 'goodness', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'psychological', 'id', 'Norman', 'Osborne', 'genuine', 'tragic', 'quality', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'good', 'Norman', 'Osborne', 'regards', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'nothing', 'less', 'son', 'actual', 'son', 'Peter', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'played', 'James', 'Franco', 'story', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'tell.As', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'intriguing', 'playing', 'goodhearted', 'character', 'hard', 'home', 'life', 'Ms.', 'Dunst', 'obvious', 'talent', 'palpable', 'chemistry', 'two', 'young', 'male', 'co-stars.The', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'movie', 'costuming', 'still', 'mystery', 'why', 'chose', 'put', 'Willlem', 'Defoe', 'metallic', 'green', 'suit', 'Goblin', 'prefer', 'famous', 'naturalistic', 'Goblin', 'comic', 'books', 'animation', 'possible', 'filmmakers', 'deemed', 'look', 'too', 'controversial', 'demonic.Also', 'starring', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Spider-Man', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'modern', 'era']",N/A

585053,A28ILXH590CMRJ,B00005JKCH,Hazen B Markoe,"[1, 1]","Like everyone else, I was wondering just how the big-budget movie version of Marvel's #1 superhero would play.  After all, audiences had suffered through the over-blown camp of Joel Schumacher's dismal BATMAN & ROBIN, and then were entertained by Brian Singer's solid X-MEN.  Fortunately, director Sam Raimi and his stellar cast create a superhero classic that will rank up there with the first 2 Christopher Reeve Superman films and the Tim Burton Batman flicks as the best of their genre.  Indeed, SPIDER-MAN achieves this distinction not for its action, but for its heart.By now, most people are familiar with Spidey's story.  A nerdy high school student, Peter Parker, gains amazing powers after being bitten by a genetically mutated spider during a field trip.  At first, he decides to use his powers for profit.  However, when his thoughtlessness results in the death of his beloved Uncle Ben, he resolves to use them for good...even though many around him question his motives. Indeed, in this movie, the whole story plays as a metaphor for one's coming-of-age...both physically and emotionally.  The casting is solid and most of them find the emotional truth in this unusual story.  Tobey Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he succeeds in getting us to empathize and root for him.  Kirsten Dunst matches him as Mary Jane Watson, the girl who he secretly carries a torch for.  Willem Dafoe is delightfully hammy as the menacing Green Goblin.  J.K. Simmons is an absolute scene- stealer as cranky newspaper editor, J. Jonah Jameson.  Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris add a wonderful touch of class as Peter's guardians, Uncle Ben and Aunt May.At a brisk 2 hours, Raimi keeps the film going at a good clip and the action sequences are engrossing.  He also has fun with his audiences.  Fans of ""Xena:Warrior Princess"" (a TV show that Raimi produced) will get a kick out the various cameos by Lucy Lawless, Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell.  Of course, one could quibble about certain things, mainly how the Goblin's suit makes him look more likely to battle the Pink Ranger than Spider-Man, but the movie is so fun that you don't really care.All too often, most comic-book based films get caught up only in the action and characterization and depth get ignored as a result.

I'm not a heavy Spiderman fan, or of comic books in general.  (Heck, I've never really even touched a comic book before.)  But I watched all the 90's Spiderman cartoon's and played the PC games and that's enough to know how the comic books go and judge the movie...and it was right on!  The story was well written, the acting was top-notch, and the web-slinging effects and fighting scenes were the best I've ever seen in a movie.  People who are hardcore Spidey fans should like it too, since the movie goes by the book...the comic book that is!  (Except for how Peter develops his web-slinging abilities.  Instead of web-shooters, the ability comes along with all the rest of his powers from the spider bite.)  That's the one and only thing I wish they would have kept the same from the comic books.

585055,A2ENJGKZZCVNKK,B00005JKCH,"Henry-Clyde ""cLaSsIc MoViE lOvEr AnD bOoK rEaDeR""","[0, 0]","Recently, superhero films have been an extremely effective genre in Hollywood. It is undeniable that superhero films are the movies that endure the most hype these days. If made correctly, these kind of movies offer plenty of action, thrills, and character, while also being impressively designed and using some of the best special effects teams around. Bryan Singer's ""X-MEN"" was the movie that introduced the superhero film to the 21st century. It raised the bar so high, the audiences were astounded and it seemed like no other movie, superhero or otherwise, could surpass it. That bar has definitely been raised to new levels many times since then with films such as the spectacular ""THE DARK KNIGHT"" and, to a lesser extent, ""IRON MAN"". However, ""SPIDER-MAN"" is nothing to sneeze at either.High school nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). His next door neighbor happens to be the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), whom Peter has loved since ""before he even liked girls"". Peter is also best friends with Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose dad is Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Norman is overly ambitious with his company, Oscorp (which supplies weapons and special equipment to the military), and wants to give Harry everything that he never had in his younger days. One life-changing day, Peter's class goes on a field trip to Columbia University's Science Department. During the tour, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically enhanced ""super-spider"" that escaped from an exhibit. That night, Norman is testing one of his company's performance enhancers on himself. The experiment goes horribly wrong, and Norman becomes the incredibly strong yet viciously insane Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Peter has undergone a night of dizziness and a stomach ache due to the spider bite. In the morning, he finds that he also has gained heightened strength, agility, can spin webs from his wrists, climb walls, and a certain ""spider-sense"" to warn him of danger. Mary Jane and Peter become much closer friends, despite the fact that she is now dating Harry. She also thinks she loves Spider-Man after he saves her life twice. Goblin is suspicious of Spider-Man's true identity. He also feels threatened by Parker, but has not yet made the connection between the two. They finally square off in a fantastic showdown that is also one of the best scenes in the entire movie.But, at the end of the day, ""SPIDER-MAN"" still has its faults. For example, what is Goblin's plan? We understand his revenge against the Quest Aerospace officials and the Oscorp board members, but what else is there? He has a personal vendetta against Spider-Man, but why? Just to write it off as him being insane is not sufficient. Up next is the cinematography during the scenes of Spider-Man swinging through the city. They play and look like a video game, with the camera seeming to be too distant and too close at the same time. The feeling of all the tension, fear, and confusion of his new powers is actually not felt at all; he acts more like a kid in a candy shop. Instead of keeping the camera a reasonable distance from him so we can see how he uses his surroundings to display his amazing powers, the camera is tight on him, right over his shoulder most of the time. Strangely, the cinematography for the action scenes is quite good. The only scene of this kind that works in this film is the ending, which was filmed with the Spyder-Cam. It was a very effective technique that was used for all the swinging and fighting scenes in ""SPIDER-MAN 2"", and I would assume it was used in #3 as well, but I haven't seen that one yet. As a matter of fact, everything in #2 is improved over #1. The acting, action pieces, dialogue, and especially the villain. Nevertheless, everything in this film still comes together reasonably well, with only a few drawbacks.SPECIAL FEATURES- Audio commentary with director Sam Raimi & producer Grant Curtis, Kirsten Dunst and producer Laura Ziskin- Audio commentary with special effects designer John Dykstra and visual effects crew- ""Weaving the Web"" optional pop-up factoids throughout film- ""Spider-Sense"" optional Web-i-sodes throughout film- Music videos with Chad Kroeger and Josey Scott: ""HERO"", Sum 41: ""WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT""- TV Spots- Theatrical Trailers- Filmographies & Character Files- DVD-ROM: Comic/Feature Comparison, Record Your Own Commentary, Countdown to ""SPIDER-MAN 2"", Weblinks- HBO Making of Spider-Man- Spider-Mania: An E!

He has a huge crush on Mary Jane Watson, his neighbor, but she probably doesn't. But, he suddenly changes once he gets bitten by a spider. He acquires superpowers and do wrestling to win money to buy a car so that Mary Jane will like him. He wins but the boss refuses to give him the amount that he owed. Spidey then doesn't stop a robber to make his point towards the boss's lies but he has made a big mistake. The robber then kills Spidey's uncle and then he gets revenge and becomes Spiderman. From then, he fights crime and then must fight a new vilain named the Green Goblin.The movie is so good because it introduces the nerdy and weak Peter Parker and it then shows his developpment into a superhero.

But I remembered how dreadful the past 2 Batman films had been, and hoped against hope that Spider-Man would be better.Was it ever.Before I go further, I'll go over the plot. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is your average high school dork. On a field trip to Columbia University's science lab, he gets bit by a genetically engineered spider. The bite gives Peter exceptional agility, stamina, and strength, as well as the unique ability to spin webs from his wrists. Originally using his powers for self-gain, he decides to change his ways when his Uncle Ben is killed by a gunman in a carjacking that he could have prevented. Living by Uncle Ben's motto, ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" Peter becomes Spider-Man. His powers come to the ultimate test when New York is terrorized by the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe).The acting was solid on all counts. Maguire was good both as the nerdy Peter Parker and the wisecracking Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst, who plays love interest and high school student Mary Jane Watson, wasn't spectacular but had great chemistry with Maguire. Dafoe was over-the-top at times as Green Goblin, but there was one scene in particular involving a mirror that was maybe the finest scene in the movie. Supporting actor J.K. Simmons stoke the show as J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of a newspaper trying to make Spider-Man come out looking like a criminal.This DVD is loaded with tons of special features and easter eggs (special features not listed on the menu that you have to 'hunt' for). Included is a gallery of Spider-Man artists, the HBO Special ""Making of Spider-Man,"" and various character files. One of my favorite easter eggs was a CGI gag reel. Good luck finding it, though.Overall, director Sam Raimi has created a comic book movie that's not just for comics fans.

Brilliant casting Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst makes a very appealing Mary Jane Watson.One technicality that probably had been mentioned:  the original Spiderman created his own webbing by making web shooters.  This led to suspense in the comic books when he runs out of web-fluid.  Here, the webs are part of his spider abilities, with no explanation why the ""I love you"" hand signal releases it.  The special effects of the webs were excellent, light years ahead of the late '70's TV series.Many mentioned that the Green Goblin could have been better.  Make-up could probably worked to make the Goblin's face more mobile as in the comics, as opposed to the expressionless metal mask in the movie.  But DaFoe made a chilling villain.One drawback:  the final battle between Spidey and the Goblin is faithful to Spiderman #122 (""The Green Goblin's Last Stand""), and also had been done by one of the animated Spiderman series (though the animated had more adapting than the movie did).I enjoyed the Batman and X-Men movies more, but this still was a very good movie.

585065,A319SKSB556033,B00005JKCH,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[2, 6]","As a fan of Spiderman I was deeply let down by this stupid, gaudy, 'Hollywood' movie version. There are so many things wrong with it I could go on for ages.First of all, it's HORRIBLY miscast. Tobey Maguire is NO Peter Parker, he is so completely wrong for the part. Jake Gyllenhaal could have been much better. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson seemed like a typical studio-exec choice. Instead of finding someone who could actually be a model/actress with a statuesque figure, real auburn hair with green eyes who could bring some integrity to the part we have ' the hottie from Bring It On who all the teenage guys like'. I personally do not find her attractive and her part in the movie is no more than 'the damsel in distress when necessary to the plot' kind. She's such a stronger character in the comic book and it's been totally ignored here. James Franco as Harry Osborne was useless. I've seen more charismatic performances from furniture. Willem Dafoe was okay as the Green Goblin but some of his dialogue was real bad, it felt like rejected Skeletor jibes from the original He-Man show. He did provoke some sympathy and coped well with the inner-turmoil story but I could not help but think that someone else could have done it better. JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell were the only bright spots among the whole cast.27-year-old Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker. A 'boy' who is blessed with web-spinning capabilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider on a field trip. You guessed it, this is another 'origins of' story. I HATE it when comic-book superhero movies feel the need to do this. Honestly, who DOESN'T know who Spiderman is or how he got his powers? The fact that Spiderman is so popular (as a franchise) is the only reason this tawdry-looking movie was a hit. I would have had so much more respect for it if it went straight to the action and didn't waste time setting things up. No superhero movie is willing to do this and it only proves even further that Spiderman was cooked up and packaged in board room meetings.As a way of disguising the fact that the whole thing is no more than processed cheese, eccentric director Sam Raimi was hired to direct. Known for his cheap but whacky movies Raimi had never really done anything big budget before this. The result is a meretricious, mess of a movie that is all over the place. I honestly thought I had walked into some Power Rangers movie.The computer effects are, quite simply, hideous. Who are they honestly trying to fool with this stuff? It boggles the mind how they ended up with an Academy Award nomination. They are really, really bad. The Styrofoam shark in Jaws: The Revenge was more convincing.Danny Elfman cranks out YET ANOTHER superhero movie score for this 'un. It's flat, boring and unimpressive. Aunt May is way too old. The Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger. The direction is uncontrolled. It's got a poor cast. The story is nothing new or daring (check out the comic books for that). It's assembled by a boardroom committee, not crafted by people who care and it's just loud, dumb entertainment when Spiderman really should be much more.The only part I appreciated was the way they made Spiderman's web biological instead of manufactured. It just makes so much more sense this way. Though there are loads out there who disagree with me.The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (I seriously think this film would have benefited from and deserved scope-widescreen but no luck) and it looks better than average. There are some color problems and it doesn't look too crisp. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is typically loud and thumping but it's nothing particularly dynamic. There are quite a few extras if you're really that much of a fan.

My superhero of choice is Superman, being a huge fan of ""Lois and Clark's"" Dean Cain and later ""Smallville's"" Tom Welling. So I decided to give Spiderman a try. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. Not knowing anything about the background of the Spiderman legend, I felt that the movie was a good mix of both explaining how Peter Parker became Spiderman and a full-length plot of his first encounter with a true villain. I normally don't like when movies these days rely too much on CGI, but I think that's a little bit unavoidable in a movie where the main character is jumping from building to building using just a few strands of a web! There was a pretty decent balance of fake stuff and plot. I'll always prefer movies based on acting (but that is just me; a lot of people love action movies). But I have to say a superhero doing these things is so much better than watching ordinary human beings doing impossible things like fighting on top of a moving train or dodging bullets!One thing I have to note is that Mary Jane Parker does not hold a candle to Lois Lane as the hero's girl. And Clark Kent has a much better conscience. But all in all a pretty good movie. I also enjoyed Spiderman 2. Spiderman 3 was a little bit overdone, I thought.

As a young child, I remember watching reruns of the 60s cartoon and the live action series of the 70s thinking that they were cool.  In the 80s there was Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (Fire Star and Ice Man) and I thought this was even better.  In the 90s Fox brought the character back to Saturday mornings among all of the ridiculous teen shows which replaced the cartoons of years gone by.  Now, finally we get a live action motion picture of my favorite neighborhood do-gooder.Hollywood reports that the idea has been bandied around for nearly 20 years and it is a good thing that we have waited.  Like the continuing Star Wars saga, the things done in this thrill-a-minute epic could not have been achieved ten years ago.  The action sequences would not have been plausible without the leaps made by the animators and computers of today.  The awesome sequence wherein Spidey leaps on and over gigantic balloon figures could only recently be realized.  But all of the breathtaking visuals are not what makes this movie special.  There is so much more.All of the lore surrounding the origin of Spidey is seen.  Bravo to Sam Raimi, a true Spider-Man afficianado!!!!  Peter Parker is raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  He is bitten by a genetically altered spider and given amazing powers.  We see Peter grow from a socially outcast teenager into an adult who has flaws.  As in the comic, Peter learns a painful lesson from Uncle Ben.  This is one of my favorite all-time lines anywhere : ""WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.""  Stan Lee wrote those words 40 years ago in the premiere edition of The Amazing Spider-Man comic book, and they are as much a part of this movie as they were then.The entire cast was super!!! Tobey Maguire is brilliant as both Parker and Spider-Man.  He is a geeky four-eyed egghead who can't even talk to M.J. The audience can feel the exuberance as Peter discovers and begins to experiment with his new power. Kirsten Dunst is so much more than the typical cardboard cutout heroine.  Willem Dafoe is masterful as the Jekyll/Hyde-ish Green Goblin.  James Franco was also great as the outcast son who takes a back seat to Peter for the attention of his father.This fantastic movie definately screams sequel.  My wish is that Mr. Raimi helms all of them and the cast remains intact  Hopefully, the characters will evolve so that the films will become better than other notable superhero franchises which fell by the wayside after their first time out.  Superman and Batman became laughable after each sequel because their characters were not developed.  Tobey Maguire at least will make sure that this will not happen.  Sam Raimi's passion for the characters should be realized.

Now through the magic of Hollywood Cinima, American audiences are further introduced to ""Spiderman"" the movie. The imaginative comic writer, Stan Lee is credited with bringing his web-swing character to life and does a 'marvelous' job of transferring the lonely, troubled teen to the big screen. His original concept is that of a young, book-worm, nerdy teenager who is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. Nearly dying, Peter Parker, (admirably played by Tobey Maguire) awakens the following day and discovers that instead of killing him, he has been transformed into a super hero with astonishing powers. Everything from his spider senses to his incredible spider strength, Parker is at first convinced he can make some easy money, by exhibiting his abilities in an arena. Unfortunely, his perception of why he was chosen is changed when his seeming ambivalence turns to tragedy with the death of his favorite uncle. The film is imaginative and laced with action scenes which enhance the comic-book-hero's' exploits. With the additional talents of Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker and J.K. Simmons as J.

I was a Batman fan but this film is visually and emotionally amazing.  This film does not go camp nor does is borrow on ideas already seen in superhero films.  It is almost a real human story.  You are left sympathizing for Peter Parker and his struggles and then cheering him on as he continues to do what is right despite all of his personal setbacks. Tobey Maguire did for this film what Michael Keaton did for Batman.  He is the essential Spider-Man.  You see that he feels right at home as Spider-Man and succeeds at making Peter Parker his own.  What is arguably the greatest and most successful comic book films of all time, it is almost as if you are reading a comic book.Willem Dafoe is simply astonishing as the Green Goblin.  While it is true that he does not compare to Nicholson as the Joker and Hackman as Luthor, he stands on his own as Osborn.  In the beginning, he&iexcl;s an ordinary billionaire, but after the accident, the transition he makes from businessman to raving psychotic is simply amazing.  You can tell he studied his character because his diction and his facial expressions are amazing if not straight out of the comics.  I remember feeling that Kirsten Dunst was miscast as Mary Jane but when I saw the film, I changed my mind.  This young lady is going places and it shows.  Mary Jane is portrayed as more of a victim in this film than she ever has in the comics or on the animated TV shows and it works.  Dunst&iexcl;s performance is breathtaking as she blends together the right mix of class, savvy, and sex appeal to make Mary Jane one of the most memorable comic book heroines ever portrayed on film.All in all, a great film which should be looked at as one of the greatest of all time.  The violence may turn some of you off but a comic book film without violence is like a romance film without kisses.

If they messed anything up, we'd be all over it with various gripes. But this movie was spectacular. Tobey Maguire was the best choice imaginable for the hero. Willem Defoe was a spellbinding Norman Osborn/Green Goblin! And, though I thought the choice poor at first, Kirsten Dunst was a stellar Mary Jane.The only gripe that I have is the fact that his webs are organic, but the absolute awesomeness (is that a real word?) of this movie makes that one thing trivial.

It had a good story, great acting, good special effects, and great action sequences.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I had a smile on my face all the way through it.  It's big and it's fun.  The DVD is also quite good.Movie: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is hopelessy in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst).  Peter gets bitten by a genetic spider while on a field trip.  Suddenly, he is able to shoot out spiderwebs, and basically be a spider.  After the tragic death of his uncle, Peter decides to use his new powers to fight crime.  From then on, he becomes Spider Man.  But, he must also fight the Green Goblin (William Dafoe) in order to save those he loves.  A great action-adventure movie everyone will love.DVD:Video: The disc comes in a 1.85:1 widescreen transfer.  A Pan & Scan version is also available.  The image looks quite good, if not great.  There are a few flaws, and the picture can occassionally be a little bright.  All in all, pretty good picture quality.  (4.5/5)Sound:  The movie comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix.  I was hoping for a little more enveloping sound, but good overall.  (4.5/5)Features:  There is an HBO making of, the evoltion of Spiderman, TV Spots, trailers, music videos, and much more.  Features are a little bit promotional, but interesting.

His senses heighten and his scrawny body is transformed into that of a professional athlete.

Superhero movies of late haven't been that great (The Hulk was an endless, rambling movie with no talent; the recent Batman movies have been nothing more than guano). And, to top it all off, I always thought Spider-Man was kind of a loser of a superhero..he is a spider, after all. But this movie changed that.Peter Parker was a normal kid in love with a flirtatious redhead named Mary Jane (just like the comics - wow!). He gets bit by a spider, meets the Green Goblin (a.k.a. best friend's dad), saves the world, and kind of gets his girl. It's a typical superhero storyline, but was directed brilliantly. Much of the time focuses on his transformation from normal to freak, which is very amusing and worth watching. There are dozens of characters which you won't be forgetting anytime soon. But I guess that's the point.. If you're going to watch a comic book-turned movie  made in recent years, this is the one to watch.

If you read Ebert's review or saw his show recently then you know what I'm talking about. For one thing I think those scenes with him web slinging look flawless. Even if it looked totally [bad] I still wouldn't give the film a bad review because of it.  Sam Raimi (Darkman, Army of Darkness) does a fantastic job of bringing Spiderman to life on the big screen. Raimi who is a big fan of Spiderman himself was perfect to direct this movie and I hope he directs each  and every sequel because no one is better for the job. I was a big fan of the Cartoon show in the 90's and everything I loved about is here.I was a little surprised that Newsday which is usually picky and loves giving low ratings actually gave it ****, I didn't expect such a high rating at all.  After seeing the movie I understand why though. It has everything, action, romance comedy and drama. It's the perfect date movie too I must add. The action scenes are incredible for one thing, the movement's quick and if you blink you might miss something but to me that's what made it fun. Tobey Maguire and Kirstin Dunst are just adorable together, they share a lot of cute and heart warming scenes. Tobey's perfect in this movie, enjoyed his performance so much that I wouldn't mind seeing him get an oscar nomination. He has so much to overcome in this movie and each and every feeling he shows...you believe.  That's how good he is.William Dafoe is also very good as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. An experiment gone wrong creates this split personality for him which drives him completely insane. Although he wears this Green Goblin costume and raises hell with glider inside he's still a decent man that has a love for his son who he has been too busy for a lot of the time. It puzzles me how Raimi manages to throw all these things together so nicely in just a 2 hour movie.

But if you are new to blu-ray or did not own the previous version, then I highly recommend you pick this up.And below are links to ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Spider-Man 3"":Spider-Man 2 (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]Spider-Man 3 (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]",4,Great movie and solid blu-ray release,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,1448,"['point', 'will', 'assume', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'film', 'great', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'film', 'image', 'quality', 'audio', 'specs', 'remain', 'same', 'previous', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'Spider-Man', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'are', 'main', 'differences', 'previous', 'Spider-Man', 'blu-ray', 'newer', 'version', 'Bonus', 'Material', 'including', 'audio', 'commentary', 'several', 'featurette', 'come', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'were', 'not', 'previous', 'blu-ray', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'here.-', 'new', 'cover', 'art', 'blu-ray-', 'Included', 'Ultraviolet', 'streaming', 'copy', 'film', 'various', 'portable', 'devices', 'so', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'on-the-go.Obviously', 'studio', 'releasing', 'new', 'blu-ray', 'capitalize', 'on/promote', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'theaters', 'summer', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'new', 'blu-ray', 'give', 'new', 'material', 'be', 'extended', 'cut', 'film', 'new', 'features.So', 'love', 'movie', 'really', 'see', 'reason', 'buy', 'again', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'experience', 'am', 'getting', 'now', 'previous', 'Spider-Man', 'discs', 'own', 'are', 'new', 'blu-ray', 'did', 'not', 'own', 'previous', 'version', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up.And', 'below', 'are', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'Spider-Man', '2', '+', 'UltraViolet', 'Digital', 'Copy', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Spider-Man', '3', '+', 'UltraViolet', 'Digital', 'Copy', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",N/A

585099,APRU373UYVK2Y,B00005JKCH,J. N. Mohlman,"[2, 3]","""Spider-Man"" as directed Sam Raimi, serves to prove that a movie can be greater than the sum of its parts.  There is no aspect of this movie that jumps out and makes the viewer gasp: the acting is solid, but not Oscar worthy, the special effects are more than serviceable, but not breathtaking, and the plot is entertaining, but not particularly complex.  However, when all of these elements are rolled in to one, you get a movie that is not just good, but great.  ""Spider-Man"" is a genuinely entertaining film that manages to avoid many of the pitfalls other comic book adaptations have encountered.  For example, it is my opinion that the X-Men movie took itself far too seriously, while conversely, the later Batman films weren't anywhere near serious enough.Driving this movie is the acting of its two main characters, Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and Kirsten Dunst as his love interest, Mary Jane.  While some have argued that Maguire's performance was somewhat leaden, I thought it was perfect within the context of the movie.  Peter Parker is supposed to be withdrawn, a nerd really, and Maguire plays the role to perfection.  On the flip side, Dunst absolutely sparkles in her role.  Much has been made of her scenes wearing a tank-top in the pouring rain, and she is an undeniably beautiful woman.  However, she is also a very talented actor who conveys the full gamut of human emotion in her facial expressions.  I came into this movie not expecting much from her, and left very impressed.  The supporting cast is likewise solid, particularly William Dafoe in the role of the schizophrenic Green Goblin.  He deftly succeeds in turning what could have been a very cookie cutter villain into a surprisingly empathetic character.The story itself is relatively straightforward, and will be familiar to anyone who has even a passing knowledge of the Spider-Man comics.  That said, it was no less enjoyable for its predictability.  In particular, the early scenes, in which Peter is coming to grips with his newfound powers, contain just the right mix of humor and suspense.Finally, this DVD is loaded with special features.  While deleted scenes are noticeably absent, they are more than made up for by outtakes, commentary, making of footage, music videos and DVD-ROM content.  You definitely get a lot of bang for the buck with this two-disc set.Ultimately, ""Spider-Man"" accomplishes exactly what it set out to: entertain.  It isn't pretentious, or riddled with `inside' jokes, but it also doesn't descend into slapstick.  It contains the perfect mixture of action, humor and romance, and combines very good performances from the cast with solid special effects.  In conclusion, I guess the highest praise I can offer this movie is that I can't believe I have to wait another year for the sequel to come out!Enjoy!",5,Great transition from the comics to the big screen,1043452800,"01 25, 2003",2003,2834,"['Spider-Man', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'prove', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'greater', 'sum', 'parts', 'aspect', 'movie', 'out', 'viewer', 'gasp', 'acting', 'solid', 'not', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'more', 'serviceable', 'not', 'breathtaking', 'plot', 'entertaining', 'not', 'particularly', 'complex', 'However', 'when', 'elements', 'are', 'rolled', 'one', 'get', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'great', 'Spider-Man', 'genuinely', 'entertaining', 'film', 'avoid', 'many', 'pitfalls', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'have', 'encountered', 'example', 'opinion', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'took', 'far', 'too', 'seriously', 'conversely', 'later', 'Batman', 'films', 'were', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'near', 'serious', 'enough.Driving', 'movie', 'acting', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider-Man', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'love', 'interest', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'have', 'argued', 'Maguire', 'performance', 'was', 'somewhat', 'leaden', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'context', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'supposed', 'be', 'withdrawn', 'nerd', 'really', 'Maguire', 'role', 'perfection', 'flip', 'side', 'Dunst', 'absolutely', 'role', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'scenes', 'wearing', 'tank-top', 'pouring', 'rain', 'undeniably', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'However', 'also', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'full', 'gamut', 'human', 'emotion', 'facial', 'expressions', 'came', 'movie', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'left', 'very', 'impressed', 'supporting', 'cast', 'likewise', 'solid', 'particularly', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'role', 'schizophrenic', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'deftly', 'turning', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'villain', 'surprisingly', 'empathetic', 'character.The', 'story', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'passing', 'knowledge', 'Spider-Man', 'comics', 'said', 'was', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'predictability', 'particular', 'early', 'scenes', 'Peter', 'coming', 'grips', 'newfound', 'powers', 'contain', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'humor', 'suspense.Finally', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'special', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'noticeably', 'absent', 'are', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'outtakes', 'commentary', 'making', 'footage', 'music', 'videos', 'DVD-ROM', 'content', 'definitely', 'get', 'lot', 'bang', 'buck', 'two-disc', 'set.Ultimately', 'Spider-Man', 'accomplishes', 'exactly', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'entertain', ""n't"", 'pretentious', 'riddled', 'inside', 'jokes', 'also', ""n't"", 'descend', 'slapstick', 'perfect', 'mixture', 'action', 'humor', 'romance', 'combines', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'cast', 'solid', 'special', 'effects', 'conclusion', 'guess', 'highest', 'praise', 'can', 'offer', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'have', 'wait', 'year', 'sequel', 'come', 'out', 'Enjoy']",N/A

The director Sam Raimi filmed many scenes in such a way as to almost seem like paging through a comic-book's storyboard while watching the exciting action and stunts. (For example, there's a scene where you see the DNA being mutated and this is what you'd see in a panel on a page in a comic book, explaining how Spider-man got that way.) Tobey Macguire is believable as Peter Parker, nerdy teenager who becomes a superhero, and Willem Dafoe is always reliably nasty as a villain. His facework in the scene showing the dual Dr. Osborn-Green Goblin is worthy of an Oscar. A bit role played by by J. K. Simmons as &quot;J. Jonah Jameson, Daily Bugle Editor&quot; was particularly amazing--he looked exactly like the comic book drawing.The surround-sound was quite distinct in this DVD--in fact, sometimes it seemed a bit contrived, as you could hear vehicles pulling up behind you, but they were clearly forward of the action on screen.

The first film is great with good acting, great special effects and music, and a great starting point for the story. It involves Peter Parker getting bitten by some kind of genetically enhanced spider, giving him the famous powers Spider-man is known for. After that you get the green goblin involved (a guy who does a science experiment on himself... but it doesn't go so well) and you have some good fight scenes and some cheesy but funny lines. There are a few particularly memorable scenes, the cage fight near the film's beginning being one of them.

585104,A3VV4GUGLUVUP1,B00005JKCH,Joel R. Bryan,"[0, 0]","Poor Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire).  He's an orphan, a put-upon science nerd, and has a lifelong crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the troubled, yet beautiful, girl-next-door.  His only friend is rich kid Harry Osborn (James Franco), and his meagre support structure includes his laid-off Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris).  While on a field trip, a genetically-altered spider bites him and...Spider-puberty!  Suddenly, Pete's got muscles and strange bodily emissions he has to keep hidden from his aunt and uncle.  The kid even starts blowing off household chores.  Of course, we know why.  He's turning into Spider-Man, the beloved hero created way back in 1962 by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.  It took years to get this lovable loser to the screen.  Anticipation ran high.Fortunately, Sam Raimi's version delivers the goods... for the most part.  It's an action adventure film with heart, and remains remarkably faithful to the spirit of those original Lee/Ditko comics; even Spider-Man's victories are left-handed gifts from the gods.  What's really wonderful about it is that it spends so much time in its characters' heads, brings them to life not with shorthanded script cliches, but nuances and the smallest moments.  Maguire's Peter is a truly smart, nice guy who suffers from painful shyness, his positive qualities completely overlooked by his peers (whose hate for him is palpable in the early going, and not just there for color).  Maguire manages to you hurt for the character in a subtle way not often seen in big-budget malarkey.  And Dunst's MJ manages to be both vulnerable and sexy, wholesome yet dangerous.  With her screaming parents and her winsome smile, it's easy to see how someone like Peter Parker would develop a secret love for her, maybe heightened by his need to protect her from the heartbreaks her future will no doubt bring her.  And Cliff Robertson conveys the decency of a man who still believes in doing the right thing, in being responsible, even as life slowly crushes him.It's in these very human, dramatic moments that it's easy to believe in these characters, but when the movie really needs to soar, when Peter Parker finds he's capable of amazing feats (wall-crawling, leaping, swinging from webs, sensing danger), we're shut out.  Peter really needs to open up and let loose (actually, so should the movie should), but instead of joie d'spider, we get a very unconvincing CGI mannequin.  We never get to sail along with Spidey in any real sense, and there's not enough veracity.  This is extremely odd, because usually it's the other way around- in the typical Hollywood blockbuster, we don't give a crap about the regular people; they get shorted so the hero can blow things up and toss off corny one-liners (something the comic Spidey does with aplomb, but rarely here).Another problem is the film's villain.  Willem Dafoe can play creepy, and he does make Norman Osborn (Harry's dad- look out Peter Parker!) suitably sympathetic as he slides into insanity.  It's just that the Green Goblin's suit, with its immobile countenance, looks more like a sleek costume for Rio's yearly Carneval than it does the garb of a madman bent on destruction.  Dafoe gets to make a few nefarious speeches, but instead of his fiercely angular face, we see the frozen rictus of a dimestore Halloween mask.  It becomes more of a voice performance, but keeps the Goblin from really coming to life.What's left is a very good film, tons of fun, and arguably the best super-hero flick since the first ""Superman,"" but one that comes so close to greatness that it's ultimately frustrating.  I can't fault them for plumping the soap opera; they reached for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" instead of ""Armageddon"" and any film that aspires to that, especially one that features a guy dressed like an insect, deserves props.  Too often giant films like this fall victim to gaudy excess, with explosions substituting for catharsis.  It's just that I enjoyed the Peter/Mary Jane/Harry scenes more than the Spidey scenes.  Most of them, anyway.  There's a moment in the middle of the film where Spidey's rescued MJ and tells her she knows him.  She's confused until he explains, ""I'm your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"" in a bouyant tone, and for that moment, he's exactly right.",4,Your Friendly Neighborhood Superhero Epic!,1020643200,"05 6, 2002",2002,4328,"['Poor', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'orphan', 'put-upon', 'science', 'nerd', 'lifelong', 'crush', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'troubled', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'girl-next-door', 'only', 'friend', 'rich', 'kid', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'James', 'Franco', 'meagre', 'support', 'structure', 'laid-off', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'field', 'trip', 'genetically-altered', 'spider', 'Spider-puberty', 'Suddenly', 'Pete', 'got', 'muscles', 'strange', 'bodily', 'emissions', 'keep', 'hidden', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'kid', 'even', 'blowing', 'off', 'household', 'chores', 'course', 'know', 'why', 'turning', 'Spider-Man', 'beloved', 'hero', 'created', 'way', 'back', '1962', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'took', 'years', 'get', 'lovable', 'loser', 'screen', 'Anticipation', 'ran', 'high.Fortunately', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'version', 'goods', 'most', 'part', 'action', 'adventure', 'film', 'heart', 'remarkably', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'original', 'Lee/Ditko', 'comics', 'even', 'Spider-Man', 'victories', 'are', 'left-handed', 'gifts', 'gods', 'What', 'really', 'wonderful', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'characters', 'heads', 'life', 'not', 'shorthanded', 'script', 'cliches', 'nuances', 'smallest', 'moments', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'truly', 'smart', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'painful', 'shyness', 'positive', 'qualities', 'completely', 'overlooked', 'peers', 'hate', 'palpable', 'early', 'going', 'not', 'just', 'there', 'color', 'Maguire', 'hurt', 'character', 'subtle', 'way', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'big-budget', 'malarkey', 'Dunst', 'MJ', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'sexy', 'wholesome', 'yet', 'dangerous', 'screaming', 'parents', 'winsome', 'smile', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'would', 'develop', 'secret', 'love', 'maybe', 'heightened', 'need', 'protect', 'heartbreaks', 'future', 'will', 'doubt', 'bring', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'conveys', 'decency', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'being', 'responsible', 'even', 'life', 'slowly', 'him.It', 'very', 'human', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'easy', 'believe', 'characters', 'when', 'movie', 'really', 'soar', 'when', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'capable', 'amazing', 'feats', 'wall-crawling', 'leaping', 'swinging', 'webs', 'sensing', 'danger', ""'re"", 'shut', 'out', 'Peter', 'really', 'open', 'up', 'let', 'loose', 'actually', 'so', 'should', 'movie', 'should', 'instead', 'joie', ""d'spider"", 'get', 'very', 'unconvincing', 'CGI', 'mannequin', 'never', 'get', 'sail', 'Spidey', 'real', 'sense', 'not', 'enough', 'veracity', 'extremely', 'odd', 'usually', 'other', 'way', 'around-', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'crap', 'regular', 'people', 'get', 'shorted', 'so', 'hero', 'can', 'blow', 'things', 'up', 'toss', 'off', 'corny', 'one-liners', 'something', 'comic', 'Spidey', 'aplomb', 'rarely', 'here', '.Another', 'problem', 'film', 'villain', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'can', 'play', 'creepy', 'make', 'Norman', 'Osborn', 'Harry', 'dad-', 'look', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'suitably', 'sympathetic', 'insanity', 'just', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'suit', 'immobile', 'countenance', 'more', 'sleek', 'costume', 'Rio', 'yearly', 'Carneval', 'garb', 'madman', 'bent', 'destruction', 'Dafoe', 'make', 'few', 'nefarious', 'speeches', 'instead', 'fiercely', 'angular', 'face', 'see', 'frozen', 'rictus', 'dimestore', 'Halloween', 'mask', 'more', 'voice', 'performance', 'Goblin', 'really', 'coming', 'life.What', 'left', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'tons', 'fun', 'arguably', 'best', 'super-hero', 'flick', 'first', 'Superman', 'one', 'so', 'close', 'greatness', 'ultimately', 'frustrating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'plumping', 'soap', 'opera', 'reached', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'instead', 'Armageddon', 'film', 'especially', 'one', 'guy', 'dressed', 'insect', 'props', 'Too', 'often', 'giant', 'films', 'fall', 'victim', 'gaudy', 'excess', 'explosions', 'substituting', 'catharsis', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'Peter/Mary', 'Jane/Harry', 'more', 'Spidey', 'scenes', 'Most', 'anyway', 'moment', 'middle', 'film', 'where', 'Spidey', 'rescued', 'MJ', 'confused', ""'m"", 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'Spider-Man', 'bouyant', 'tone', 'moment', 'exactly', 'right']",N/A

585106,AIWRBCDSPCDRE,B00005JKCH,"John Adams ""Farley Flavors""","[1, 1]","Spider-Man is a super hero that has been a part of my life for a very long time ever since I was old enough to understand the meaning of the words ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility."" Everything about Spider-Man was unorthodox, mainly due to the character's status in the world as both Peter Parker and as Spider-Man... Peter Parker is an outcast due to his vast intelligence, and eagerness for learning which, in effect ostracizes him from the rest of the human race.  Spider-Man, meanwhile has a problem, due to the constant paranoia of the people, due to their uncertainty of what to make of him. A paranoia that is fueled by an untrustworthy J. Jonah Jameson's propaganda. These elements have made Spider-Man such an appealing character for me to grow up watching, and believe you/me I have. I spent all my childhood watching reruns of the old 1960's cartoon, then it was the old 1980's cartoon, and finally the sublime 1990's animated series. Though there was also a touch of the overly silly 1970's live action series. So obviously I've been eagerly awaiting Spider-Man to web-sling into a new medium, preferably the cinema.... Well finally my wish has been granted and it's beautiful!!! I will admit this was a frightening wait for the movie to come along. Especially when I keep hearing about changes in the stories and even with certain tidbits of the production, I was on pins and needles. I mean come on! If Cameron directed DiCaprio would've been Spider-Man! I don't think so! So when I heard about the changes in personnel I was seeing the ray of hope. Firstly Sam Raimi as director. at the time the news was announced I was just becoming a fan of his thanks to the beautiful ""Evil Dead"" Trilogy, and so I knew that Raimi was a director with a disciplined visual style, a knack for character depth, and an appealing sense of humor. So ""Spider-Man"" was right up his alley. As for the man who would be the spider? Tobey Maguire had earned my respect the first time I saw him in ""Pleasantville"" I saw that he can play humble, while at the same time strong in both the mind and body, and to top it all off HE CAN ACT!!! Don't believe me? Watch ""Cider House Rules,"" watch ""Wonder Boys,"" you'll see what I mean. If there was any assurance about Spider-Man being great, the credit definitely goes to Raimi and Maguire. Don't fret there's more credit to be sorted out, sit tight. The next aspect of credit goes to Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn AKA The Green Goblin. I knew Dafoe was perfect for the role after I saw him in ""Shadow of the Vampire,"" and obviously I wasn't disappointed. Probably for me his performance was at it's most effective in the scenes in his room. Whereas Osborn speaks to the Goblin in the mirror which gives me a fond recollection of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde which, in a symbolic sense is exactly what is happening to Osborn. Since we're talking about one Osborn lets talk about another. Let's Talk about James Franco as Harry. Franco automatically gained my sympathy at the first moment you meet him and truly gained the believability of being Dafoe's son.Oh, and speaking of believability, nothing filled me with more mirth than J.K. Simmons' Dead-on portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson, he's a fast talking, obnoxious, opportunist who for some reason or another trusts his barber as opposed to the plain facts. As for other obvious mentionables, there's Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben who show this beautiful commitment to their characters and you see their eagerness to ensure that Peter is raised right. Now if there was a surprise in this cast it was Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. At first glance of her in the trailer, you think ""Oh, eye candy, just there to be saved all the time."" Not even! Her performance succeeded in giving the character the depth and dimension that must be expected in the ""Spider-Man"" world. Plus... she looks bloody good as a red head. Now onto technical aspects... I could really care less about special effects and CGI as long as they're believable and it succeeds in getting the point across as to what's supposed to happen. Fortunately these effects combined with Sam Raimi's wonderful cinematic vision deliver a completely energetic cinematic rush that has truly never been seen before. As for the script. David Koepp was the last guy I'd have wanted to write for it, but he ended up proving me wrong. He managed to tell Spider-Man's legacy with that same humanity and flair that embodies the characters, though I won't say the script is flawless. It does suffer moments where the characters say the occasional line that reeks of Saturday morning cartoons. Thankfully I can tell that Sam Raimi noticed this and took advantage of that to add in his genius input to make the dialogue less painful and more appealing. I'm not gonna get into the costumes... Spidey looks the way he needs to look, and Goblin looks the way he's supposed to look when the suit was made by a high-tech research organization. So stop complaining you silly obsessives and enjoy it.So, in conclusion I will say that Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire have done for ""Spider-Man"" what Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve did for ""Superman."" AND what Tim Burton and Michael Keaton did for ""Batman""(Figured I'd add that in.) But Finally A Hollywood feature with a load of hype that actually managed to support the hype. Could this be a glimpse of great things to come? I hope so! But basically I say SEE ""SPIDER-MAN!!!"" and SEE IT AGAIN!!!",5,You'll Believe a Man Could Web-Sling,1022457600,"05 27, 2002",2002,5502,"['Spider-Man', 'super', 'hero', 'been', 'part', 'life',

585107,ANM4I38VRP1VR,B00005JKCH,John Bolier,"[1, 1]","Since his inception onto the comic book scene in 1962, Spider-Man has enthralled two generations of teens and adults alike.  As a teenager I can vividly remember many days spent at my friend's house, seeing a Spider-Man comic book collection so large that it protruded from under his bed in a huge cardboard box.  He kept each issue individually wrapped in its own plastic case, treating them like exquisite artifacts that an archaeologist might dig up at the Great Pyramid of Egypt.  Despite who my friends were, I never really read comic books and thus failed to comprehend their appeal.  However, I found the new cinematic adaptation of Spider-Man invigorating, injecting an infusion of vitality into a comic book movie I haven't experienced since director Tim Burton's Batman in 1989.Spider-Man is a vast improvement over the recent X-Men movie adaptation.  Spider-Man didn't suffer from the superfluous dull exposition that plagued X-Men.  The first hour of the film entertained me more that the action packed second hour.  We are treated to many humorous incidences when Peter Parker is discovering his new powers.  At the screening I attended the theater erupted with laughter at them.The special effects worked because I felt I vicariously lived through Spider-Man as he spun his webs and swung across the canyons of New York City.  It made my vertigo kick in.  However, in certain scenes, Spider-Man appeared slightly too cartoonish and failed to blend into his non-computer generated surroundings.  The final scene of the film illustrates my point.Tobey Maguire proved to be a brilliant casting coup.  He perfectly captured the quirky nerdiness of the teenage Peter Parker.  After being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, Peter Parker wakes up the next day and discovers his new gifts; he at first, merely uses his powers for personal gain and does what any teen would do.  He enters a wrestling competition to earn $3000 to buy a car to impress the object of his desire, Mary Jane Watson, played effectively by Kirsten Dunst.Willem Defoe must have relished playing the dual role of Norman Osbourne and the Green Goblin.  Upon drinking the enhancement serum, his personality is split.  Defoe plays Osbourne's manic side to perfection.  Director Sam Raimi utilized adroit editing to depict the simultaneous evolution of Peter Parker and Norman Osbourne.  Defoe's a fine actor and proves it once again here with his villainous turn.  He'll go down in the comic book movie villain hall of fame with Gene Hackman (Lex Luthor) and Jack Nicholson (the Joker).Supporting characters, J.K. Simmons and James Franco gave phenomenal performances as J.J. Jameson and Harry Osbourne respectively.  Simmons was hysterical and we can only hope his screen time is increased in the eventual sequel.  Franco's performance reflected the mild jealousy he had of Peter Parker because Parker gained his father's admiration.Spider-Man received an appropriate PG-13 rating because there were some scenes involving the Green Goblin that might be too scary for young children.  Composer Danny Elfman's score for Spider-Man proved to be the most unremarkable thing about the film.  I couldn't remember a note of it as I walked into my car in the parking lot immediately upon viewing the film.  Could anyone say that about John Williams's score for Superman?  I think not.  The ""Don't mess with New Yorkers,"" dialog near the climactic fight atop the Queensborough Bridge made me wince and cover my face.  Such a blatant display of political rectitude in the wake of the September 11th tragedy should have been left on the cutting room floor.Spider-Man ranks behind the first Superman film as the best comic book adaptation ever made.  It's genuine fun.  The thrilling actions sequences will quench the thirst of the summer moviegoer parched for excitement.",4,Spider-Man Swings,1020988800,"05 10, 2002",2002,3846,"['inception', 'comic', 'book', 'scene', '1962', 'Spider-Man', 'enthralled', 'two', 'generations', 'teens', 'adults', 'alike', 'teenager', 'can', 'vividly', 'remember', 'many', 'days', 'spent', 'friend', 'house', 'seeing', 'Spider-Man', 'comic', 'book', 'collection', 'so', 'large', 'protruded', 'bed', 'huge', 'cardboard', 'box', 'kept', 'issue', 'individually', 'wrapped', 'own', 'plastic', 'case', 'treating', 'exquisite', 'artifacts', 'archaeologist', 'might', 'dig', 'up', 'Great', 'Pyramid', 'Egypt', 'who', 'friends', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'thus', 'failed', 'comprehend', 'appeal', 'However', 'found', 'new', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'Spider-Man', 'invigorating', 'injecting', 'infusion', 'vitality', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Batman', '1989.Spider-Man', 'vast', 'improvement', 'recent', 'X-Men', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Spider-Man', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'superfluous', 'dull', 'exposition', 'plagued', 'X-Men', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'entertained', 'more', 'action', 'packed', 'second', 'hour', 'are', 'treated', 'many', 'humorous', 'incidences', 'when', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'discovering', 'new', 'powers', 'screening', 'attended', 'theater', 'erupted', 'laughter', 'them.The', 'special', 'effects', 'worked', 'felt', 'vicariously', 'lived', 'through', 'Spider-Man', 'spun', 'webs', 'swung', 'canyons', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'made', 'vertigo', 'kick', 'However', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Spider-Man', 'appeared', 'slightly', 'too', 'cartoonish', 'failed', 'blend', 'non-computer', 'generated', 'surroundings', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'point.Tobey', 'Maguire', 'proved', 'be', 'brilliant', 'casting', 'coup', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'quirky', 'nerdiness', 'teenage', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'being', 'bitten', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'spider', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'discovers', 'new', 'gifts', 'first', 'merely', 'powers', 'personal', 'gain', 'what', 'teen', 'would', 'do', 'wrestling', 'competition', 'earn', '3000', 'buy', 'car', 'impress', 'object', 'desire', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'played', 'effectively', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst.Willem', 'Defoe', 'must', 'have', 'relished', 'playing', 'dual', 'role', 'Norman', 'Osbourne', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'drinking', 'enhancement', 'serum', 'personality', 'split', 'Defoe', 'Osbourne', 'manic', 'side', 'perfection', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'utilized', 'adroit', 'editing', 'depict', 'simultaneous', 'evolution', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Norman', 'Osbourne', 'Defoe', 'fine', 'actor', 'once', 'again', 'here', 'villainous', 'turn', ""'ll"", 'go', 'down', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'villain', 'hall', 'fame', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', '.Supporting', 'characters', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'James', 'Franco', 'gave', 'phenomenal', 'performances', 'J.J.', 'Jameson', 'Harry', 'Osbourne', 'respectively', 'Simmons', 'was', 'hysterical', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'screen', 'time', 'increased', 'eventual', 'sequel', 'Franco', 'performance', 'reflected', 'mild', 'jealousy', 'had', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Parker', 'gained', 'father', 'admiration.Spider-Man', 'received', 'appropriate', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'were', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'scary', 'young', 'children', 'Composer', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'Spider-Man', 'proved', 'be', 'most', 'unremarkable', 'thing', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'note', 'walked', 'car', 'parking', 'lot', 'immediately', 'viewing', 'film', 'Could', 'anyone', 'say', 'about', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'Superman', 'think', 'not', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'dialog', 'climactic', 'fight', 'Queensborough', 'Bridge', 'made', 'wince', 'cover', 'face', 'blatant', 'display', 'political', 'rectitude', 'wake', 'September', '11th', 'tragedy', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor.Spider-Man', 'ranks', 'first', 'Superman', 'film', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'ever', 'made', 'genuine', 'fun', 'thrilling', 'actions', 'sequences', 'will', 'quench', 'thirst', 'summer', 'moviegoer', 'parched', 'excitement']",N/A

585111,A2GF5IC9G15K3O,B00005JKCH,"John Q. Viewer ""godzillafan36""","[1, 1]","This movie is just that, pure fun.  Now, as a once avid reader of the comic books, I knew the story already, but I won't spoil it for people who've never heard of Spider-Man before.  Even though it was a moderately predictable movie for anyone who's read the story, it doesn't take away from the fun.  What DID take away only minimally was the obvious product placement.  I mean, Pete practices aiming his webs on a Dr. Pepper can, come on.  And when the Green Goblin attacks the people at the festival, they always show wide shots of him going around all of the billboards for Cingular, Samsung, and so on.  I mean, come ON guys.  But, what are you gonna do, right?  The acting and script are on par with the comic book, and that means that it's moderately lame.  But, then again, you're not gonna see this movie for acting, you're gonna see it for ACTION, and this movie's got boatloads of it.  Trust me when I say this, the Cinematography is EXCELLENT.  Especially when Peter's chasing the robber.  Absolutely brilliant.  And I am very pleased that they didn't change Spidey's costume, but the Goblin's costume is...very blecch.

(and showing how Peter changes into Spider-Man dosesn't count as character development.) Where's the good action scenes? (And Spider-Man tying bad guys up in a giant web does not qualify as a good action scene.) Where is the drama and emotion? And what in the hell was up with the script??? What is with all those cheesy lines??? One sentance to sum up all of these questions--THE MOVIE WAS TOO LIGHT HEARTED, LITTLE-KIDDISH, AND ""FAMILY SAFE""!!!!!!!!I walked into this movie opening night with high hopes of a kick ass superhero film full of action and good acting (based on what I saw in the previews).  But what I got was Spider-Man going through typical high-school problems, action scenes consisting of saving a woman's baby from a burning building and performing matrix-like moves to dodge homing-razors, stupid moments that were supposed to be funny but just fell flat such as Peter making stupid hand gestures trying to figure out how to use his web, and most of all--some of the CHEESIEST lines ever used in a superhero movie.  Here is some of thse lines that just make me wanna puke:1. Spider-Man to Macho Man Randy Savage during a wrestling match:-Spider-Man-- ""That's a cute outfit. Did your husband get it for you?""2. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin squaring off:-Goblin-- ""Are you in or are you out?""-Spider-Man-- ""it's you who's out, Gobbie, out of your mind!""3. Spider-Man to Mary Jane after rescuing her and swinging her accross the city to the top of a building:-Spider-Man-- ""Well, beats taking the subway, haha.""--AND THE ONE THAT TOLD ME THAT THIS MOVIE WAS INTENDED TO BE FOR LITTLE KIDS--4. Spider-Man to Mary Jane:-Mary Jane-- ""Who are you?""-Spider-Man-- ""You know who I am.""-Mary Jane-- ""I Do?""-Spider-Man-- ""Yep. Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!""I'm sorry, but that kind of talk does not deserve to be in a superhero action movie, but instead in a little-kids superhero movie. This movie was not at all what I expected it to be. It was just way too light-hearted for my liking.Now the movie did have some good action scsnes and a few good parts. Willem Dafoe did a great job as the ""green goblin"". And the special edition DVD made the movie worth buying. But all-in-all, if you are looking for a top-notch, action packed, dramatic superhero movie, Spider-Man definately does NOT deliver. Watch Batman, Blade, The Hulk, or even X-Men.""SPIDER-MAN"" runs for about 2 hours. It is rated PG-13 for light cartoonish action violence. Really could have been rated PG--it is safe for any age really.

Zarco,"[1, 1]","After 25 years in development hell, Sam Raimi(The Evil Dead, Darkman) and Columbia Pictures brought Spiderman to the big screen in the Spring of 2002. The film does justice to Marvel's Spiderman comic books and it's fun to watch even if you've never read a comic book. Tobey MacGuire plays Peter Parker and his alter ego Spiderman. During a field trip, a radioactive spider escapes from its cage and it bites Parker on the hand! The spider bite gives him superpowers such as a ""Spideysense"" and the ability to shoot webs. In the comic book, Peter uses ""prosthetic web shooters"". In the Spiderman movies, the web shooters are organic. Peter Parker has a crush on Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst), a redheaded girl who goes to the same high school.After Peter's uncle Ben Parker(Cliff Robertson) is killed by a mugger, Peter fights crime as Spiderman. Spiderman has to help people as the malevolent, psychotic, power-hungry Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe) kills people in New York.TV's Spiderman and his Amazing Friends(1982) and a Spiderman T-shirt that I wore in 1985 were my first exposure to Spiderman. Although, Spiderman has been around since the 1960's. A live action Spiderman movie project was passed around from studio to studio. Cannon Films had the Spiderman filmmaking rights at one time. At one time, James Cameron was going to direct the film.A movie poster and a movie trailer with the World Trade Center was used to promote the Spiderman movie in 2001. Both disappeared after the Terrorist Attack on September 11th, 2001. Spiderman(2002) is jam-packed with patriotism and flag-waving.The visual effects in Spiderman have been criticized for looking rubbery and cartoonish, but they get the job done. The visual effects in Spiderman 2(2004) and Spiderman 3(2007) make it up to us by having eye-popping, glossy visual effects. The late ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage plays a wrestler that Peter Parker fights in an arena. Lucy Lawless, Bruce Campbell, and director Sam Raimi make cameos in the film. Tobey MacGuire was an inspired choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman. He has to be mild-mannered, strong, and good-looking at the same time. Kirsten Dunst is quite good as Mary Jane. The upside down kissing scene is a classic. James Franco is quite good as Peter's friend, Harry Osborne. Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin. Rosemary Harris plays Aunt May and J.K. Simmons plays Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson. Danny Elfman's Spiderman music score is good. Spiderman was spoofed on The Simpsons and the ""Weird Al"" Yankovic song 'Ode to a Superhero'.John Dykstra(Star Wars, Batman Forever) crafted the visual effects for Spiderman(2002).

High school nerd, Peter Parker (Tobey MaGuire) is bitten by a genetically enhanced super-spider, and his body changes to the likes of a spider. Enabling him to crawl up buildings, and shoot a webby substance. Peter takes full advantage -- in the positive way -- of his new found skills, and begins to solve crime for the city. When a villain (William Defoe), with superpowers also, begins to destroy the city, Peter must stop him. It's the simple good guy against bad-guy-who-wants-to-destroy-everything plot seen in every superhero movie (Except for X-Men which had a much deeper plot, but let's not compare). But the premise does work here, and keeps you entertained.The acting was great. Tobey MaGuire is Peter Parker to the core. Innocent, appealing, and a knack for small humor makes him a perfect lead. Kirsten Dunst is our female lead, and she -- as always -- is wonderful. I've never seen her play the damsel in distress part, but she pulled it off. And her smile lights up any day. William Defoe is the antagonist Green Goblin. Defoe handled this part fairly well and made it believable. Especially during the moments when he had to be Norman Osburn and The Green Goblin. But I just didn't buy his whole character. I found it more interesting when Peter was fighting off criminals. Except for the World Day Celebration scene. That was awesome. The rest of the supporting cast were great. Especially Uncle Ben, played by Cliff Robertson.The special effects is the place where it gets kind of hokey. You can absolutely tell when Peter is CGI and when he's not. The whole CGI bit is what puts it off, but still, it's topnotch. The scenery is great, and gave the movie a real comic book feel to it. But again, I go back to not liking the Green Goblin much. His costume looked like my kid cousin's Halloween costume from 5 years ago. But maybe that's what Raimi was going for.In the end, Spiderman was an entertaining movie that sucked you in. It's high gross rankings are certainly well deserved.",4,"Movie's Great, Acting's Awesome, FX's Par.

Peter Parker is an unassuming student who is smart, shy, and loves the girl next door (Mary Jane).  But a trip to Columbia University's science department changes his life.  There he is bitten by a genetically designed super spider.The bite causes genetic changes in Peter and he becomes part spider.  At first he wants to use his new abilities to make money so he can impress Mary Jane.  But when his own spiteful inaction leads to the death of his uncle, peter decides to fight crime.The movie does a nice job of setting the stage of the series while still brining in a super-villain.  In this film, the villain is The Green Goblin and his movie incarnation is nowhere near as silly as his comic book version.Casting was well done for most of the cast.  Dunst manages to give some excellent Mary Jane smirks, the Osbornes actually look like they could be father and son and J. Jonah Jameson looks like he stepped right off the comic page.  But is they worked so hard on Jameson's look, why were there no widow's peaks for the Osbornes?There have been changes to the character and story of Spider-Man.  Most notably, he actually generates webs (from his hands no less) so there will be no classic empty web-shooter plot twists.  Mary Jane is not killed off on the bridge as she was in the comics (an issue of What If showed just how horrible the world would become is Spider-Man succeeded in rescuing her).  We see how Peter's fingers can cling to the wall but, like in the comics, we still don't know how his shoes do it.This is a fun film and if you can get past the fact that it is not the comic book you should enjoy it.  The only real flaws I saw were a few inconsistencies in scale during some of the CGI scenes (that and the total lack of concern on the part of the University when it is pointed out that there is a super-spider missing).",4,Never a Dull Movie From Sam Raimi,1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,1932,"['Spider-Man', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'hero', 'been', 'adapted', 'changed', 'big', 'screen', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'unassuming', 'student', 'who', 'smart', 'shy', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'trip', 'Columbia', 'University', 'science', 'department', 'life', 'bitten', 'genetically', 'designed', 'super', 'spider.The', 'bite', 'genetic', 'changes', 'Peter', 'part', 'spider', 'first', 'use', 'new', 'abilities', 'make', 'money', 'can', 'impress', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'when', 'own', 'spiteful', 'inaction', 'death', 'uncle', 'peter', 'decides', 'fight', 'crime.The', 'movie', 'nice', 'job', 'setting', 'stage', 'series', 'still', 'brining', 'super-villain', 'film', 'villain', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'movie', 'incarnation', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'silly', 'comic', 'book', 'version.Casting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'most', 'cast', 'Dunst', 'give', 'excellent', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'smirks', 'Osbornes', 'actually', 'look', 'could', 'be', 'father', 'son', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'stepped', 'right', 'comic', 'page', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'Jameson', 'look', 'why', 'were', 'widow', 'peaks', 'Osbornes', 'have', 'been', 'changes', 'character', 'story', 'Spider-Man', 'Most', 'notably', 'actually', 'webs', 'less', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'classic', 'empty', 'web-shooter', 'plot', 'twists', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'not', 'killed', 'off', 'bridge', 'was', 'comics', 'issue', 'What', 'showed', 'just', 'how', 'horrible', 'world', 'would', 'become', 'Spider-Man', 'succeeded', 'rescuing', 'see', 'how', 'Peter', 'fingers', 'can', 'cling', 'wall', 'comics', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'shoes', 'do', 'it.This', 'fun', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'not', 'comic', 'book', 'should', 'enjoy', 'only', 'real', 'flaws', 'saw', 'were', 'few', 'inconsistencies', 'scale', 'CGI', 'scenes', 'total', 'lack', 'concern', 'part', 'University', 'when', 'pointed', 'out', 'super-spider', 'missing']",N/A

I didn't want another campy, cutesy movie based on a comic book that would ruin all the great feelings I had about the superhero. Thankfully, director Sam Raimi managed to pull it off -- with a little help from Maquire, Kirsten Dunst as MJ, Willem Dafoe as The Green Goblin, and a few other great character actors.Sometimes, movies based on books (or even comic books) require a knowledge of the material before the movie makes sense. That's not the case with Spiderman, however. This movie can be enjoyed with no prior knowledge of Spidey whatsoever.If you're looking for a little light entertainment, and want a fun, entertaining movie that's head and shoulders above most others released this past year, give Spiderman a try.

585126,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JKCH,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 0]","After almost a decade of legal battles, Sony Pictures was finally able to move into production the comic book adaptation of Marvel's popular hero Spiderman.  Though once the legality was straightened out, a new problem presented itself, leaving Sony with the question of ""Who will direct and star in this picture?""  The answer took some time, and while the question loomed in Hollywood, the rumor mill was going crazy.  For a while most of the rumors surrounded who would star in the film, since James Cameron was tapped to direct for the longest time.  Names for who would star ranged from Leonardo DiCaprio to Luke Perry, I believe even Kurt Russell was rumored for a little while (though he would be too old).  Frankly all of the rumors for the cast stunk, I figured that Hollywood was just going to screw up what could possibly redeem the comic book to film genre, a genre that hadn't existed since it's untimely demise at the hands of ""Batman & Robin"" and ""Spawn"".  Thankfully, God had to have been smiling on this movie, as all casting rumors were debunked, including James Cameron as director (though I would have been happy with him behind the camera).  With this announcement it was revealed that director Sam Raimi (director of the `Evil Dead' series) would direct the movie, and Tobey Maguire would fill the dual role of Peter Parker/Spiderman (this choice scared many comic book fans, there was no doubt that Tobey could fill the geeky shoes of a pre-Spiderman version of Peter Parker, but once he got his powers, Tobey's weak, thin frame would not do the trick).  Needless to say all concerns were soon swept away when Spiderman was released to theaters amidst considerable praise from critics, movie audiences, and comic book fans alike.  With the success of ""X-Men"" and then ""Spiderman"" we had entered a new era in movie history, a time in which comic books could be adapted to film and treated with realism and respect.""Spiderman"" as both comic and non-comic book fans know, is the story of mild-mannered nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman), who during a science class gets bitten by a radioactive spider.  This spider bite sends the radioactivity into Parker's system, giving this puny man of science the proportionate strength and abilities of a spider.  Peter discovers his newfound abilities and embraces them, he sees them as a means to which he can win the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and also improve his lot in life.  However, Peter's hopes and dreams would soon come crashing down around him, when after competing in a wrestling event for money, Peter chooses not to stop a thief that ran right by him with the victim in close pursuit.  Unfortunately for Peter this decision will haunt him for the rest of his life, when his beloved Uncle Ben is shot down in a carjacking by the very same thief that Peter could have stopped.  This action causes Peter to learn his most valuable lesson, ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and also leads to Peter becoming the web-swinging, wall-crawling hero, Spiderman.  As this all occurs, billionaire industrialist Norman Osborn (Wilem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin), is being forced out of his own company, Oscorp, by the board members, due to his failure to snag a multi-billion dollar weapons contract with the U.S. military.  The cause of the failed agreement was an unstable strength enhancing drug, Osborn overwrought with hatred and self-pity for being forced out of his company tests the drug on himself, creating the deranged, psychopathic Green Goblin.  With Norman as the Green Goblin he sees the need to eliminate those who wronged him and his company and then take control of New York City.  However, Spiderman isn't about to let this happen, not without a fight.After the huge success of Fox Studios' ""X-Men"", Sony Pictures really had their work cut out for them, as all eyes were on whether or not another comic book adaptation could succeed.  Needless to say Sony Pictures' ""Spiderman"" passed the test with great ease, giving audiences a thrill-a-minute adventure that they would not soon forget.  With an impressive story, superb directing, incredible casting (Tobey Maguire's awesome performance of the dual roles of Peter Parker/Spiderman, being the biggest surprise), and a great soundtrack, ""Spiderman"" was an incredible comic book adaptation and heroic origin tale, that did what all movies (comic book and otherwise) should do, that is, leave the audience craving more.  As I said earlier, ""Spiderman"" praised, not only by critics and general audiences, but also the ever-so picky comic book fans, which is not an easy task.  If you enjoyed ""X-Men"", or the `Superman' films or the `Batman' films, then this movie is a definite must-see.  I guarantee that you will enjoy ""Spiderman"" over and over again.""Spiderman"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",5,The Amazing Spiderman...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,4906,"['almost',

585131,A207ETNAPKIHW0,B00005JKCH,kapil,"[1, 1]","I'm a long time fan of the Spider-Man comics, so I went into this film with cautious optimism. I'd been burned by comic movies many times before. I'm pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. This was an excellent adaptation of the comics! In fact, I'd say this is one of the best comic movies ever made. I personally feel it's in the class of the first Superman and Batman movies. I loved the X-Men movie, but I think Spider-Man surpassed it. I'm so happy they got it right. They got the perfect mixture of romance, action, humor, and drama in the film. It's a rare thing to see it all come together so well, but they pulled it off. You feel like you're a friend of Peter Parker's and you're following him on this incredible journey.I had several favorite scenes. The first of which was when he first discovered his powers. There's like a 20-minute stretch where you're just laughing and amazed at the same time. As he discovered his power to stick to things and shoot webs, it's really hilarious. His confrontation with Flash is fun and cool. There's nothing better than seeing the geek triumph. And Peter's first attempts to actually shoot a web and swing on it were classic. &quot;Up, up, and away, web! Shazam!!&quot; I know some people hate the organic web shooters, but I think they turned out perfect in the film. It was a good move to change it from the comic and it not only added some funny moments, but it made Spider-Man more like a spider.Another awesome scene is when Peter pursues the burglar in the movie. If you've read the comics, you know what an emotional moment this is. It's even more powerful and exciting on the big screen. When this happens, Peter has yet to perfect his powers. As he tries to chase down a car, he stumbles, fumbles, and almost gets killed multiple times. He's not yet the graceful superhero that he eventually becomes. But his anger, determination, and thirst for revenge drive him, and it makes the chase all the more desperate. It's one of the best action scenes ever in a comic movie. By the time it's over, you really understand his motivations for becoming a superhero.My third favorite scene is the final battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. It's a brutal knock down, drag out fight that is very impressive. While Spider-Man has been a dominant force throughout the film, he pretty much has his backside handed to him by the Green Goblin. It's his first real fight for simple survival, and it really feels like it. And the ending is faithful to the comics, too. It really sets things up for the sequel.What sets Spider-Man apart from bad comic movies is the characterization. For every action scene, there are two scenes of simple conversation between characters. Sam Raimi goes to great pains to make you care for ALL of the characters before he gets into the action. You feel sorry for Peter when he's picked on. You sympathize with Mary Jane's as she goes from one abusive relationship to another. You understand the tension and love between Harry and his father Norman. You really care for Aunt May and Uncle Ben. So when these extraordinary events start taking place, you have an emotional attachment to the characters. You really feel what they feel.Tobey Maguire is a great Peter Parker. He's shy and geeky in school, yet smart-mouthed and confident as Spider-Man. He was a questionable choice early on when casting the role, but he really proved himself. Kirsten Dunst is great as the girl next door. Just like the comic character, her happy exterior hides an unhappy soul. Dunst makes it easy to see why she'd start feeling attracted to Peter. Willem Dafoe was a perfect Green Goblin. Then again, he's always been good at playing psychos. Dafoe is successful at making the Green Goblin both evil and sympathetic at the same time. He also dances along the line of being over-the-top without ever quite going over it like a lot of the Batman villains did. Finally, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is absolutely hilarious. He's actually the one that goes over-the-top and it's perfect. He's cheap, rude, and a loudmouth. You can't ask for anything more.Overall, Spider-Man is a wonderful moviegoing experience for people who love the comic and those who have no idea what &quot;Excelsior!&quot; means. Oh, and watch for cameos by Xena's Lucy Lawless as a punk rocker, Stan Lee saving a little girl, Bruce Campbell as the ringannouncer, and more.have to echo some of the gripes of other people who have reviewed this movie. The first is the soundtrack by Danny Elfman. The music is pretty good for this film, but there is no definitive Spider-Man theme. Batman had a great one. Superman had a fantastic one. Spider-Man got nothing. The music is rather unmemorable. I hate saying this in light of the fact that I generally love Elfman's work.My second gripe is the effects. They ranged from jaw-droppingly amazing to very, very fake. I thought the effects worked best when the camera was either sitting still or moving slowly. It was times like that which you could appreciate the gracefulness of Spidey and what he was doing. The rest of the time the camera was moving, twisting, and turning so wildly that it was hard to figure out what was happening. It made for more dynamic scenes, but all you could see was a blue and red blur wiggling on the screen. If it's between decent effects or a great story, I'd take the great story. But it would be nice to have both.My final complaint is that the movie felt like it skipped a beat in the middle. Peter goes from graduating from high school and being semi-competent with his powers to being a full-fledged superhero in New York. The only thing that bridges the two is a montage of scenes where New Yorkers talk about Spidey's exploits and we see flashes of him in action. It's fun, but it felt like something was missing. I wanted to see more scenes of Spidey fighting crime. I suppose it had to be shortened in the interest of time, but I would have liked to have seen more.'Nuff said.",5,this is a fun popcorn movie,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,5997,"[""'m"", 'long',

But I did rent, and I sat down and watched it, and when it was over, I said, ""Wow! That was pretty cool!"" The special effects were cool, and it was well directed. The acting was pretty good, and they didn't kill the plot from the comic books.The story, which probably everyone know, is a high schooler who is about to graduate, get bit by a geneticly engineered ""super spider"". The super spider's powers are transferred into Peter Parker. So, over night, he turns from a weak geek, into a strong man. He doesn't need his glasses anymore, either. Bit by bit he descovers his powers, climbing on walls, jumping really far, extra strong, shooting webs, and sensing danger. So he creates a ... costume, and goes wrestling for three minutes for 3000 dollars. But the guy only gives him a hundred because he pinned him in two, not three. Then a robber comes and steals the money and Peter lets him go. Then later, his Uncle Ben is shot by the same robber, so he devotes himself to fighting crime, and also he got a cool costume.Meanwhile, Norman Osborn, a scientist takes a human body enhancer that is suposed to increase strength by 800%. But the enhancer isn't ready, and he suffers from the side effects, anger, aggression, and insanity. So he has kind of a split personality, one good, one bad. So he steals a high tech glider and creates a costume and becomes the Green Goblin. At the end Spider-Man and the Green Goblin have a show down, which is pretty cool.So all in all, it is a pretty cool action movie, with cool special effects, and they didn't ruin this movie, like they did with Daredevil, which was really stupid. So as comic book movies go, this is at the top with X-Men. So if you haven't seen it, and you think it will be stupid, go give it a try, actually, it was pretty cool.",4,"Actually, It was pretty Cool",1056412800,"06 24, 2003",2003,1940,"['never', 'saw', 'movie', 'theatre', 'never', 'rented', 'usterday', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'stupid', 'nothing', 'bunch', 'hype', 'did', 'rent', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'Wow', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'cool', 'was', 'well', 'directed', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'plot', 'comic', 'books.The', 'story', 'probably', 'everyone', 'know', 'high', 'schooler', 'who', 'graduate', 'get', 'bit', 'geneticly', 'engineered', 'super', 'spider', 'super', 'spider', 'powers', 'are', 'transferred', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'So', 'night', 'weak', 'geek', 'strong', 'man', ""n't"", 'need', 'glasses', 'anymore', 'either', 'Bit', 'bit', 'powers', 'climbing', 'walls', 'jumping', 'really', 'far', 'extra', 'strong', 'shooting', 'webs', 'sensing', 'danger', 'costume', 'wrestling', 'three', 'minutes', '3000', 'dollars', 'guy', 'only', 'hundred', 'pinned', 'two', 'not', 'three', 'Then', 'robber', 'money', 'Peter', 'go', 'Then', 'later', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'shot', 'same', 'robber', 'fighting', 'crime', 'also', 'got', 'cool', 'costume.Meanwhile', 'Norman', 'Osborn', 'scientist', 'human', 'body', 'enhancer', 'suposed', 'increase', 'strength', '800', '%', 'enhancer', ""n't"", 'ready', 'side', 'effects', 'anger', 'aggression', 'insanity', 'So', 'kind', 'split', 'personality', 'one', 'good', 'one', 'bad', 'high', 'tech', 'glider', 'costume', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'end', 'Spider-Man', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'have', 'show', 'down', 'pretty', 'cool.So', 'pretty', 'cool', 'action', 'movie', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'did', 'Daredevil', 'was', 'really', 'stupid', 'So', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'go', 'top', 'X-Men', 'So', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'stupid', 'go', 'give', 'try', 'actually', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool']",N/A

Hunter,"[0, 0]","You must hand it to Raimi for not only successfully translating this larger than life legend to the silver screen, but also toppling the George Lucas juggernaut.  I think the charm of this film is that it is a nerdy hero puts aside his pride and steps up to his duty and calling as a superhero.  It is a very intimate and emotional movie that hits all the right butons.Maguire plays Peter Parker perfectly.  I am glad that they found an actor who actually looked and played the part, rather than taking Hollywood's flavor of the month.  You believe that Parker is really a goof and a nerd, and you know that he revel in being Spiderman, the coolest of he cool.My favorite scene is Parker's epiphany, when he decides to take up the mantel and captures the man who killed his grandfather.  Parker is awkward and clumsy as he begins his chase, but he eventually get the carjacker, and gets a clue that he need to be a super-hero.  I think the nice touch is when Park swings on street level, he has to dodge the streetlights.  They paid that much attention to detail.Kirsten Dunst play MJ well.  She is caught between several men: Flash Thompson, Harry Osbourne, Peter Parker, and Spiderman.  Yet she manages to keep her head, and play a darn good scream queen to boot.  She is the love interest, but is able to transcend the role and bring life.Judging from the gag reel, I think Willem Defoe was having too much fun playing the Green Goblin and it hurt some of his performances.  He wasn't an menacing as he could be because he was laughing his head off behind the mask.As to the DVD, I am one of those people who likes the features disk over the film disk.  Seeing all of the behind the scenes  clips enhances the film for me.  I love the commentaries, and especially the gag reels.  I just wish there was a way to be able to reintegrate deleted scenes back into the film.

Perhaps that is why I enjoyed this movie so much.  It brought me back to a time when I just loved being a kid.  Sure, I got picked on by bullies and I was a nerd, but ""Spiderman"" always gave me the hope that one day I would become something that no bully could ever touch.  That's the brilliant thing about this movie.  It reminds you that we have all been the geek or the loser at some point in our lives, but in the end, we always get the upper hand and become something great.  It recalls those days when the sky was the limit and reality was only as close as your eighteenth birthday.In essence, this movie is fiction at its best.  It makes you forget your troubles for a little while and leaves you with a good feeling.The storyline stays true to the comic, with the exception of Spidey's web-slinging ability.  Although that minor detail actually makes the character more believable as superheroes are concerned.  The movie isn't as dark as ""Daredevil"" or serious as ""X-Men.""

His execution of the mythos of Spider-Man onscreen is simply flawless.And in these troubled times, isn't this what movie goers and film buffs want?

Who cares because everyone connected with this years box office smash made millions. Some necessary editing caused a delay in the release, but it was worth the wait. The WTO scenes had to be cut. And we now settle in for a super cinematic treat.I thought the Goblin was kind of goofy. A more dramatic foe would have been Venom or Carnage. Let's hope one of them will pop up in the next episode.I was happy to see that the movie's rating allowed for the little ones (kids) to view the film. On the other hand the death scene was much more graphic then any comic book Stan Lee or Todd Mc Farland had ever penned. It's a shame too.

585157,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JKCH,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 9]","For starters ""Spider-Man"" is probably the most faithful translation of a comic book superhero to the big screen.  Throughout the movie I kept thinking, yes, this is in ""Amazing Fantasy"" #15, that is from the cover of ""Spider-Man"" #39, and that is what ""really"" happened to the Green Goblin.  Go back and look at ""Batman,"" ""Superman"" or any other comic book film and you will find that beyond the basic plot of their origin, you will not find anything reminding you of specific issues or great moments from the actual comic books.  On this score I believe the credit goes to director Sam Raimi, but there is always the possibility David Koepp's screenplay might have had something to do with it (note: Stan Lee and Steve Ditko get credit for creating Spider-Man but John Romita, Sr. deserves some credit too given that much of his artwork is invoked by the film as well).Of course there are differences, because film is a different medium from comic books (feel free to quote me on that one).  Some of the changes result from a desire to provide an appropriate rationale for Spidey's powers.  This means we get a scientist providing expositionary details during the visit to the lab where the spider (now genetically enhanced rather than radioactive) puts the bite on Peter Parker.  While this works for the ability to cling to walls and the good old spider-sense, I am less sure about the natural web spinning ability.  I mean, on the one hand, the invention of his special web fluid was how we knew Peter was a brilliant young scientist, while on the other, how does the web go through the costume?  No, this is not ""No Prize"" worthy, but it does bug me.My thoughts on other changes: Yes, it was good to forget about Gwen Stacy, go right to Mary Jane Watson and completely ignore Betty Bryant, given the history of Peter Parker's love life.  However, having MJ have a crush on Spidey smacks too much of Superman and Lois Lane for my taste, although since she is a high school senior they were right to tone down her sexuality from the bombshell Peter finally encountered in the comic.  The Spider-Man costume looks a lot better than I thought it would and I certainly understand why the Green Goblin goes heavy metal.  However, the yellow eyes on/off was a bit bothersome, although, again, I understand why you do not want two characters with giant eye blanks trying to have a lengthy conversation.My biggest complaint with the film would be that the computer generated sequences of Spider-Man web-slinging through New York City just do not seem real.  Granted, it is really hard to get a feel for watching somebody do that (compare it to Tarzan going through the trees in the old Johnny Weismueller films versus the Disney cartoon), but maybe they can do something in the future films.  Similarly, some of the fight sequences when Spider-Man takes on a gang seem (ironically) rather cartoonish and, again, I wonder if it is because this is computer generated action.The casting is fine, although Rosemary Harris never looks as frail as we all remember Aunt May.  Tobey Maguire tends to keep things a bit too sedate with MJ after his transformation, but there is undeniable chemistry between him and Kirsten Dunst at key moments in the film.  Willem Dafoe does some of his best acting opposite himself (you will see), and James Franco does a nice job of reinventing Harry Osborn for the modern world.  Special kudos to J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who only has a limited number of scenes because he steals every single one of them.  Look real quick to spot Stan Lee in this film.""Spider-Man"" is one of those films you give 4.5 stars, because it manages to surpass expectations in some key regards while still needing to be improved in some other areas.  However, the basics are all here for extending the franchise and I have to think that the second time around they will fix all of these ""problems.""  Ultimately, the faults are not of the comic book story but of the filmmaking, and who would have ever thought that would be the case?  The main thing is that even hardcore Spider-Man fans are not going to be bitterly disappointed by this film.",5,"Maybe the most faithful ""comic book"" movie of all time",1020556800,"05 5, 2002",2002,4152,"['starters', 'Spider-Man', 'probably', 'most', 'faithful', 'translation', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'kept', 'thinking', 'yes', 'Amazing', 'Fantasy', '15', 'cover', 'Spider-Man', '39', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Go', 'back', 'look', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'basic', 'plot', 'origin', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'reminding', 'specific', 'issues', 'great', 'moments', 'actual', 'comic', 'books', 'score', 'believe', 'credit', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'always', 'possibility', 'David', 'Koepp', 'screenplay', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'note', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'get', 'credit', 'creating', 'Spider-Man', 'John', 'Romita', 'Sr.', 'credit', 'too', 'given', 'much', 'artwork', 'invoked', 'film', 'as', 'well', '.Of', 'course', 'are', 'differences', 'film', 'different', 'medium', 'comic', 'books', 'feel', 'free', 'quote', 'one', 'changes', 'result', 'desire', 'provide', 'appropriate', 'rationale', 'Spidey', 'powers', 'get', 'scientist', 'providing', 'expositionary', 'details', 'visit', 'lab', 'where', 'spider', 'now', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'rather', 'radioactive', 'bite', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'ability', 'cling', 'walls', 'good', 'old', 'spider-sense', 'am', 'less', 'sure', 'natural', 'web', 'spinning', 'ability', 'mean', 'one', 'hand', 'invention', 'special', 'web', 'fluid', 'was', 'how', 'knew', 'Peter', 'was', 'brilliant', 'young', 'scientist', 'other', 'how', 'web', 'go', 'costume', 'No', 'not', 'Prize', 'worthy', 'bug', 'me.My', 'thoughts', 'other', 'changes', 'Yes', 'was', 'good', 'forget', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'go', 'right', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'completely', 'ignore', 'Betty', 'Bryant', 'given', 'history', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'love', 'life', 'However', 'having', 'MJ', 'have', 'crush', 'Spidey', 'smacks', 'too', 'much', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'taste', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'were', 'right', 'tone', 'down', 'sexuality', 'bombshell', 'Peter', 'finally', 'encountered', 'comic', 'Spider-Man', 'costume', 'lot', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'certainly', 'understand', 'why', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'heavy', 'metal', 'However', 'yellow', 'eyes', 'on/off', 'was', 'bit', 'bothersome', 'again', 'understand', 'why', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'two', 'characters', 'giant', 'eye', 'blanks', 'trying', 'have', 'lengthy', 'conversation.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'computer', 'generated', 'sequences', 'Spider-Man', 'web-slinging', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'real', 'Granted', 'really', 'hard', 'get', 'feel', 'watching', 'somebody', 'do', 'compare', 'Tarzan', 'going', 'trees', 'old', 'Johnny', 'Weismueller', 'films', 'versus', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'maybe', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'future', 'films', 'Similarly', 'fight', 'sequences', 'when', 'Spider-Man', 'gang', 'seem', 'ironically', 'rather', 'cartoonish', 'again', 'wonder', 'computer', 'generated', 'action.The', 'casting', 'fine', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'never', 'as', 'frail', 'remember', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'keep', 'things', 'bit', 'too', 'sedate', 'MJ', 'transformation', 'undeniable', 'chemistry', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'key', 'moments', 'film', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'best', 'acting', 'opposite', 'will', 'see', 'James', 'Franco', 'nice', 'job', 'reinventing', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'modern', 'world', 'Special', 'kudos', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'who', 'only', 'limited', 'number', 'scenes', 'single', 'one', 'Look', 'real', 'quick', 'spot', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'film', 'Spider-Man', 'one', 'films', 'give', '4.5', 'stars', 'surpass', 'expectations', 'key', 'regards', 'still', 'needing', 'be', 'improved', 'other', 'areas', 'However', 'basics', 'are', 'here', 'extending', 'franchise', 'have', 'think', 'second', 'time', 'will', 'fix', 'problems', 'Ultimately', 'faults', 'are', 'not', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'filmmaking', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'main', 'thing', 'even', 'hardcore', 'Spider-Man', 'fans', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', 'film']",N/A

There were deep emotional connections with each main character.  It was just so awesome. I heard their supposed to make 2 more, I dunno how they can top this one, but I'd love to see it done, or at least just as good!!! I don't want to see another ""Mummy Returns""!!!But this movie was just awesome, just don't have to many expectations. I may have, but I could feel the movie before I saw it, I could kinda sense it. And it gave my emotions the kick-start they'de needed for a couple of weeks(With God's work I use my emotions alot).So I definetely recomend it. Its not just an action movie, its a very emotional film(In a good way!!!), thoughtfull, good strong charcters, and well its just plain good!!!So *enjoy*, I honestly *HOPE* you will!!!

585168,A3NZVCL9N8CLHB,B00005JKCH,"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True""","[1, 1]","I give it 3.75 or just under 4 stars. Spiderman was a decent and enjoyable movie, but still suffers from the curse of the superheroe movies.First of all, I must say the fact that he had his webbing come directly out of his wrists bothered me. In the comics peter parker invented his webbing and used machines to shoot it, it wasn't one of the powers he got from being bitten by the radioactive spider. Also there are other inaccuracies. Stan Lee let the director and producers change things as they saw fit in both Spiderman AND Xmen (and probably will in daredevil and the hulk coming out soon too). I don't look kindly on to this. Why can't they stick to the original, perfectly good story? Every time a book or comic transitions into a movie people complain when they make changes... so why not listen for once??Anyhow, some other things bugged me. Spiderman himself looked pretty good, in that he didnt look like a complete idiot in his spandex suit. But the green goblin's suit was just completely rediculous. I've also never been much of a fan of the old spiderman enemies (greengoblin being the main archvillain), Im a child of the 80's and early 90's so I always liked the newer characters like Venom, Carnage and such much more that the corny ones from the 60's. So I am a bit biassed. I also dont really like comics being made into movies because, well... come on... when a guy is running around with super spider powers in a cartoon or comic its dramatic, fun, and can even be taken seriously. But when you have a real guy running from roof to roof in tights in live action video... it's tough to not find it corny or silly.Still this movie had many good points. It was generally an enjoyable experience. The special effects were great and it was much better all around than X-men was. The acting was ok, and while some points of the real comic story were altered many other details were kept in tact (at least sort of).Overall this isn't a bad movie, but I don't consider it a GREAT movie either. It's a great choice to rent on a weekend or to put on at a get together though. And watching it once will probably be atleast somewhat enjoyable for most fans.I cant give it 4 stars but it gets a solid 3 stars for sure.",3,almost 4 stars... but not quite.,1052179200,"05 6, 2003",2003,2228,"['give', '3.75', 'just', '4', 'stars', 'Spiderman', 'was', 'decent', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'still', 'suffers', 'curse', 'superheroe', 'movies.First', 'must', 'say', 'fact', 'had', 'webbing', 'come', 'directly', 'wrists', 'bothered', 'comics', 'peter', 'parker', 'invented', 'webbing', 'used', 'machines', 'shoot', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'powers', 'got', 'being', 'bitten', 'radioactive', 'spider', 'Also', 'are', 'other', 'inaccuracies', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'let', 'director', 'producers', 'change', 'things', 'saw', 'fit', 'Spiderman', 'Xmen', 'probably', 'will', 'daredevil', 'hulk', 'coming', 'out', 'soon', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'kindly', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stick', 'original', 'perfectly', 'good', 'story', 'time', 'book', 'comic', 'transitions', 'movie', 'people', 'complain', 'when', 'make', 'changes', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'listen', 'once', 'Anyhow', 'other', 'things', 'bugged', 'Spiderman', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'didnt', 'look', 'complete', 'idiot', 'spandex', 'suit', 'green', 'goblin', 'suit', 'was', 'just', 'completely', 'rediculous', ""'ve"", 'also', 'never', 'been', 'much', 'fan', 'old', 'spiderman', 'enemies', 'greengoblin', 'being', 'main', 'archvillain', 'Im', 'child', '80', 'early', '90', 'so', 'always', 'liked', 'newer', 'characters', 'Venom', 'Carnage', 'such', 'much', 'more', 'corny', 'ones', '60', 'am', 'bit', 'biassed', 'also', 'dont', 'really', 'comics', 'being', 'made', 'movies', 'well', 'come', 'when', 'guy', 'running', 'around', 'super', 'spider', 'powers', 'cartoon', 'comic', 'dramatic', 'fun', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'when', 'have', 'real', 'guy', 'running', 'roof', 'roof', 'tights', 'live', 'action', 'video', 'tough', 'not', 'find', 'corny', 'silly.Still', 'movie', 'had', 'many', 'good', 'points', 'was', 'generally', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'X-men', 'was', 'acting', 'was', 'ok', 'points', 'real', 'comic', 'story', 'were', 'altered', 'many', 'other', 'details', 'were', 'kept', 'tact', 'least', 'sort', '.Overall', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'great', 'choice', 'rent', 'weekend', 'put', 'get', 'together', 'watching', 'once', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'atleast', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'fans.I', 'cant', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'solid', '3', 'stars', 'sure']",N/A
585169,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JKCH,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 1]","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the quintessential boy next door.  He is kind of geeky, more than a little shy, and really nice.  Of course he is also very good at science.  Peter goes on a field trip to a laboratory doing interesting genetic experiments on spiders, and one happens to have escaped during Peter's field trip.  Naturally the ferocious little critter bites Peter.  Soon Peter discovers that he is really strong, and can shoot webs out his wrists, and can climb walls with his bare hands.  Why, Peter has become a superhero!  As those of us familiar with the superhero genre know, there is a lot of angst in the superhero world.  In Peter's case, it is the guy that he could have stopped with his new powers that kills his Uncle Ben (played by veteran Cliff Robertson), a guilt that plagues Peter through decades of Spider-Man comics and now in this movie.Peter also has yearnings for the beautiful redheaded girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  Given Peter's natural shyness and his feelings of inadequacy, he has a hard time telling Mary Jane that he is attracted to her a lot.  Mary Jane adds to Peter's angst.Peter's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) gets to heap on the angst yet further since she has lost her husband of many years when Peter could have prevented it, though Aunt May has yet to learn this information.  Poor Peter.  If angst were money Peter would be rich.  However, Peter also gets a cool enemy, the Green Goblin, aka Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe).  The Green Goblin has a cool sort of Jet Ski for the air that emits a smoky trail, so that environmentalists will hate him since clearly it is the good spider versus the evil industrialist.As corny as the plot sounds, this movie is highly entertaining and enjoyable.  The computer generated images are well done, with some of the scenes approaching phenomenal.  While the quality of the plot and the ambiance fall short of ""Superman the Movie"" and ""Batman,"" this movie still joins the select group of superhero movies that are sufficiently believable and sufficiently true to the original comics to allow followers of Spider-Man comics to enjoy this movie.  Spider-Man is not an invincible superhero, and there are points where you wonder how he can possibly beat the Green Goblin.  I kept hoping that he would tell Mary Jane how he felt about her, but that has to wait another day.Technology has advanced to the point where movies such as ""Spider-Man"" are more than technologically advanced B-movies.  Tobey Maguire can act, as evidenced by his phenomenal role in ""Seabiscuit,"" and he does well in this movie.  While there were a few places where I was a little frustrated, I think it was because Peter Parker was less predictable in this movie than I would have expected from the comics, and that is a very good thing.There are several editions of ""Spider-Man"" available.  I prefer wide screen, but the second disc of the special edition is, like most special editions, uneven in its extras.  Some are reasonably good, others are filler.  If you have purchased other special edition DVDs, you will probably like this one.  Otherwise, get a lower cost wide screen variation and pass the special edition by.  However, whatever you do, you should get this one if you like superhero movies, because as a superhero movie this one is a winner.",4,Does Whatever a Spider Can,1109116800,"02 23, 2005",2005,3332,"['Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'quintessential', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'kind', 'geeky', 'more', 'little', 'shy', 'really', 'nice', 'course', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'science', 'Peter', 'field', 'trip', 'laboratory', 'doing', 'interesting', 'genetic', 'experiments', 'spiders', 'one', 'have', 'escaped', 'Peter', 'field', 'trip', 'Naturally', 'ferocious', 'little', 'critter', 'bites', 'Peter', 'Soon', 'Peter', 'really', 'strong', 'can', 'shoot', 'webs', 'out', 'wrists', 'can', 'climb', 'walls', 'bare', 'hands', 'Why', 'Peter', 'become', 'superhero', 'familiar', 'superhero', 'genre', 'know', 'lot', 'angst', 'superhero', 'world', 'Peter', 'case', 'guy', 'could', 'have', 'stopped', 'new', 'powers', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'played', 'veteran', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'guilt', 'Peter', 'decades', 'Spider-Man', 'comics', 'now', 'movie.Peter', 'also', 'yearnings', 'beautiful', 'redheaded', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Given', 'Peter', 'natural', 'shyness', 'feelings', 'inadequacy', 'hard', 'time', 'telling', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'attracted', 'lot', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'angst.Peter', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'heap', 'angst', 'yet', 'further', 'lost', 'husband', 'many', 'years', 'when', 'Peter', 'could', 'have', 'prevented', 'Aunt', 'May', 'yet', 'learn', 'information', 'Poor', 'Peter', 'angst', 'were', 'money', 'Peter', 'would', 'be', 'rich', 'However', 'Peter', 'also', 'cool', 'enemy', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'aka', 'Norman', 'Osborn', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'cool', 'sort', 'Jet', 'Ski', 'air', 'smoky', 'trail', 'environmentalists', 'will', 'hate', 'clearly', 'good', 'spider', 'evil', 'industrialist.As', 'corny', 'plot', 'movie', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'scenes', 'approaching', 'phenomenal', 'quality', 'plot', 'ambiance', 'fall', 'short', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'Batman', 'movie', 'still', 'select', 'group', 'superhero', 'movies', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'believable', 'sufficiently', 'true', 'original', 'comics', 'allow', 'followers', 'Spider-Man', 'comics', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Spider-Man', 'not', 'invincible', 'superhero', 'are', 'points', 'where', 'wonder', 'how', 'can', 'possibly', 'beat', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'kept', 'hoping', 'would', 'tell', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'how', 'felt', 'wait', 'day.Technology', 'advanced', 'point', 'where', 'movies', 'such', 'Spider-Man', 'are', 'more', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'B-movies', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'can', 'act', 'evidenced', 'phenomenal', 'role', 'Seabiscuit', 'well', 'movie', 'were', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'was', 'little', 'frustrated', 'think', 'was', 'because', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'was', 'less', 'predictable', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'comics', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'several', 'editions', 'Spider-Man', 'available', 'prefer', 'wide', 'screen', 'second', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'most', 'special', 'editions', 'uneven', 'extras', 'are', 'reasonably', 'good', 'others', 'are', 'filler', 'have', 'purchased', 'other', 'special', 'edition', 'DVDs', 'will', 'probably', 'one', 'Otherwise', 'get', 'lower', 'cost', 'wide', 'screen', 'variation', 'pass', 'special', 'edition', 'However', 'do', 'should', 'get', 'one', 'like', 'superhero', 'movies', 'superhero', 'movie', 'one', 'winner']",N/A

Believe that Spiderman will clean up in every city in the US and also have a great ride internationally. Cinematography and special effects are phenomenal, Danny Elfman's music is outstanding. New York City is surreal, and yet the main characters are believable as natives ""from Queens"".Casting Tobey McGuire as Parker/Spiderman was a thoughtful choice, and helped to keep the film close to the origins of the Marvel comic. Critics said the same things about Michael Keaton before they saw him play the odd Bruce Wayne in the first Batman. Kristen Dunst sparkled. Character actors in the role of the newspaper publisher (this guy is also a villain on HBO's ""Oz"" and a shrink on ""Law and Order""; when does he rest?), and Peter's uncle (a cameo by Cliff Robertson having a bad hair day) were just cartoonish enough to help make the film.But, a film is only as good as its villain.The Green Goblin is more stylish than expected, and William Dafoe is a better actor than what you would expect to be cast. But, he goes over the top and seems uncomfortable no matter which of his two personas is up for a scene. Points to the original Batman, where Jack Nicholson set the standard for all villains to come.

Ramos ""Soundtrack and Film Freak""","[5, 5]","In the last decade, Hollywood has given us a bunch of bad popcorn movies that sometimes we wonder what the heck is happening with the most powerful film industry in the world.  Well, maybe I should leave out ""The Matrix"" and ""X-Men"", which were great entertainment flicks.  But here is one of the best movies of 2002: ""Spider-Man"".This is perhaps the best popcorn movie I've seen in years.  Great performers, great characters, fantastic story.  It's got almost everything that a good piece of entertainment should have.  The story of a young boy -played here to flawless perfection by Tobey Maguire -who is stung by a super radioactive spider, and his life is changed forever.  His battle with one of his arch-enemies, The Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe, in a scene-chewing performance), is fantastic considering the bond between their corresponding alter-egos.  Peter Parker's secret crush to Mary Jane (lovely Kirsten Dunst) is perhaps what drew me closer to the Parker/Spidey character, not to mention the twist ending that reminded of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in ""Casablanca"".  I really love this movie.""Spider-Man"" came in the same year of ""Star Wars-Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"".  When I came out of the theater, after seeing Spidey in action, my heart was filled with fear because it made me wonder ""a movie about a web-slinging, wall crawling superhero is gonna be better than a ""Star Wars"" flick?""  And I wasn't mistaken: this film is better than Episode II.As for the DVD, all I have to say is that I love the documentaries; I love the profiles on director Sam Raimi and composer Danny Elfman; and I definitely love the gag reel with the bloopers.

My roommate in college was a comic geek, and I was inundated  by the life and times of...  Spidey wasn't my favorite (I was more a Dr. Strange type), but he was a regular visitor.  As such, I have an entire set of preconceptions about what he would sound like and how he would act.So my first reaction when Tobey Maquire showed up on the screen was that this was going to be a very tiresome film.  While I changed my mind about the film as it went on, I'm still not happy with Maguire's presentation.  It feels overplayed to me, and stiffer than even Peter Parker's early shyness would justify.  Its not so much bad acting as it is that this Spider-Man doesn't match up to the voice in my head when I was reading the comics.In contrast, most of the other characters are dead on.  Especially the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons - who was perfect).  At some point, though, the quality of the film overwhelms any quibbles about an individual acting flaw, and the viewer simply forgets that this modern Spidey isn't a perfect reflection of the past.  It captures the spirit, and some of the wow factor of becoming and being a superhero while maintaining a near-perfect, comic book atmosphere.Spidey has always been one of the most human and accessible of the pulp do-gooders.  He has problems, makes mistakes, and learns as he goes along.  The film emphasizes this in a way that gives Peter Parker and his alter ego a vivid reality the Batman or Superman never quite achieved in their own films.  Maguire captures this struggle well, even if he isn't my perfect Spider-Man.This two DVD package has enough extra stuff to keep you busy for a day or two.

While he's having fun climbing walls and shooting webbing, his best friend's dad is undergoing a transformation of his own.  Norman Osborn has tried a highly risky experiment on himself, and it's made him crazy.  Transforming into the Green Goblin, he fights to bring down all those who oppose him.  When Spiderman gets in his way, the battle ensues.What really drew me to this movie was the emotions and struggles it puts the characters through.  Peter is forever longing to be noticed by Mary Jane, and his sudden transformation doesn't turn her eye.  Yet he's also aware that keeping who he has become a secret is highly important to the safety of his friends and family.  That last scene was dynamite!  I also enjoyed the Jekyll/Hyde relationship that Norman had with the Green Goblin.  That was filmed and written well, making the villain slightly sympathetic himself.  The actors do a wonderful job of drawing me in and making me care for the characters.  Much like the real world, not everything gets resolved easily, and this movie certainly left me wanting to know more.The DVD set is wonderful as well.  The film is preserved with clear picture and sound.  The commentaries are interesting and there are loads of behind the scenes things to go through.

Even back in 1962 with the appearance of the comic Spiderman, artists Stan Lee and Steve Ditko dared to show the flip side of a super powered hero.  When Spiderman was not in uniform, he was your ordinary geeky high school science whiz, who, unlike Clark Kent, did not have to pretend to be a walking victim.  As director Sam Raimi saw him, Spiderman is a walking mess of neuroses.  Simply donning a costume does not change the inner man.  Tobey Maguire, who plays Peter Parker, the Spiderman, does not allow his super powers to alter his basic sense of character.  As a counterpoint to Parker, another superpowered human, the Green Goblin (Willim Dafoe), serves as a twisted doppleganger.  Both Spiderman and the Green Goblin achieve their powers in such a way that tests them more internally than physically.  With Parker, he is bitten by a radioactive spider that alters his DNA to give him the proportionate strength and agility of a spider.  With the Goblin, he plays the Mad Scientist who uses himself as a guinea pig to test a drug that will give him powers roughly equal to those of Parker's.  But in Parker's case, he has the advantage of his wise Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who warns him that with great power comes great responsibility.  Parker refuses to heed this sage advice at first, but later comes to realize its validity.  There is no equivalent for the Goblin, who seeks only increasing power to fuel his own mania.Much of the charm of SPIDERMAN is visual.  There are numerous scenes of both Spiderman and the Green Goblin launching themselves through space and from building to building.  The scenes that accompany this visual treat bring to mind the similar scenes that Superman and Lois Lane played out in the earlier SUPERMAN movies, where Christopher Reeve saved Margot Kidder from falling from a skyscraper.  Parker's romantic interest is Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who is both sweet and believable as a young lady who drifts from one man to another until she discovers that her true love (Parker) has always been right there for her.  The audience is never permitted to see the movie solely in terms of escapist derring do.  Although much of SPIDERMAN is exactly that, its more subtle charm is in its insistence that behind the glamor of a mask and power must beat a heart that permits the hero to remember that raw power used without consideration for others is seen ultimately as making its possessor as weak and as pathetic as any science geek before he gets bitten by a spider that offers him a choice about life and ethics.  Those like Peter Parker make the right choice and can still live a relatively normal life.  Those like the Green Goblin do not and the inevitable loss of both stature and power makes him stagger about the stage, like a wounded King Lear, bemoaning life's terrible ironies.",4,Spiderman: You Need Not be a Kid to Like It,1036713600,"11 8, 2002",2002,3018,"['Most', 'people', 'who', 'fantasize', 'being', 'costumed', 'superhero', 'usually', 'upside', 'super', 'powers', 'extraordinary', 'strength', 'zooming', 'air', 'adoration', 'fans', 'Even', 'back', '1962', 'appearance', 'comic', 'Spiderman', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'dared', 'show', 'flip', 'side', 'super', 'powered', 'hero', 'When', 'Spiderman', 'was', 'not', 'uniform', 'was', 'ordinary', 'geeky', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'whiz', 'who', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'pretend', 'be', 'walking', 'victim', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'saw', 'Spiderman', 'walking', 'mess', 'neuroses', 'Simply', 'donning', 'costume', 'not', 'change', 'inner', 'man', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'who', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Spiderman', 'not', 'allow', 'super', 'powers', 'alter', 'basic', 'sense', 'character', 'counterpoint', 'Parker', 'superpowered', 'human', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Willim', 'Dafoe', 'twisted', 'doppleganger', 'Spiderman', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'achieve', 'powers', 'such', 'way', 'more', 'internally', 'physically', 'Parker', 'bitten', 'radioactive', 'spider', 'DNA', 'give', 'proportionate', 'strength', 'agility', 'spider', 'Goblin', 'Mad', 'Scientist', 'who', 'guinea', 'pig', 'test', 'drug', 'will', 'give', 'powers', 'roughly', 'equal', 'Parker', 'Parker', 'case', 'advantage', 'wise', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'who', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'Parker', 'heed', 'sage', 'advice', 'first', 'later', 'realize', 'validity', 'equivalent', 'Goblin', 'who', 'only', 'increasing', 'power', 'fuel', 'own', 'mania.Much', 'charm', 'SPIDERMAN', 'visual', 'are', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'Spiderman', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'launching', 'space', 'building', 'building', 'scenes', 'accompany', 'visual', 'treat', 'bring', 'mind', 'similar', 'scenes', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'played', 'out', 'earlier', 'SUPERMAN', 'movies', 'where', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'saved', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'falling', 'skyscraper', 'Parker', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'sweet', 'believable', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'one', 'man', 'true', 'love', 'Parker', 'always', 'been', 'right', 'there', 'audience', 'never', 'permitted', 'see', 'movie', 'solely', 'terms', 'escapist', 'derring', 'do', 'much', 'SPIDERMAN', 'exactly', 'that', 'more', 'subtle', 'charm', 'insistence', 'glamor', 'mask', 'power', 'must', 'beat', 'heart', 'hero', 'remember', 'raw', 'power', 'used', 'consideration', 'others', 'seen', 'ultimately', 'making', 'possessor', 'weak', 'as', 'pathetic', 'science', 'geek', 'bitten', 'spider', 'choice', 'life', 'ethics', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'make', 'right', 'choice', 'can', 'still', 'live', 'relatively', 'normal', 'life', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'do', 'not', 'inevitable', 'loss', 'stature', 'power', 'stagger', 'stage', 'wounded', 'King', 'Lear', 'bemoaning', 'life', 'terrible', 'ironies']",N/A

After seeing it, I just didn't have the enthusiam that I did when I went and saw it.Spiderman tells the orign of spiderman almost to the exact that it did in the comic books. The same for the green goblin. I was impressed and loved that Sam Rami did that. A comic book movie has to stay true to its roots. If it doesn't it disrespects how it got to the big screen. Spiderman didn't do that.Tobey Maguire was a good Spiderman and Peter Parker. He developed the character well and was most of all believable as Spiderman. Tobey has the look that Peter Parker had in the comics.Kristin Dunst plays Mary Jane Watson who is Peter Parker's childhood crush. She looks great in the movie. It's a better role for her than some of the ones she has played in the past. Her and Tobey have good chemistry together, but this is one of the places that I thought the movie got itself in some trouble. While Peter did like Mary Jane, his real love was Gwen Stacy. That's the only place were Sam Raimi messes up in this movie. Also the love scenes are to drawn out. Especially the one in the hospital.William Dafoe was a perfect Green Goblin. He impressed me a lot in the movie. The guy has always come off to me as an intense actor. He plays an intense character and does it well. I also loved the shape the guy was in. Both him and Tobey got in amazing physical shape to play there roles.Another thing I didn't like in the movie was the fight scenes. I thought most of them were to CGI. I felt they should have put more hand to hand action in there. I also didn't like the power ranger like costumes.I did however like some of the special effects. Spiderman when he web slinged was impressive. Without CGI they wouldn't have been able to do a lot of that. He look as real as a Spiderman could.I liked Spiderman. I do it.

The movie seems to as much fun to people like myself who&#146;ve never read the Marvel Comics series as it is to ardent comic book fans. On reflection, the film is filled with plot holes and serious lapses in logic. [For example, why does the hero take for granted his sudden new powers? How can a mere mortal slam through a brick wall virtually unscathed?] This criticism is hardly relevant, however, because any great escapist entertainment movie exists in its own world. Anyone who confuses its world with the real one needs a major reality check.Peter Parker [Tobey Macguire] is a quiet, nerdy high school senior. Intensely shy, he can not bring himself to tell Mary Jane [Kirsten Dunst], the girl next door, that he has been in love with her since he was six years old. Taunted and ridiculed by bigger, more athletic boys, Peter is miserable. All this changes when he is bitten by a genetically altered spider at a local science museum. Suddenly he is all muscle. He can scale buildings and weave webs that allow him virtually to fly all over New York City. After an appalling family tragedy, Peter decides to use his powers to fight crime. Real danger comes along in the form of a local tycoon who is himself altered in a science experiment gone wrong. Peter, now AKA Spider-Man, must uses all his powers to fight this evil tyrant.Tobey Macguire was the perfect choice to play Spider-Man. His quiet persona and his decent-but-not-great looks make his transformation exceptionally appealing. There is something about his performance that is quite touching, thus making his character a superhero that people can actually relate to.  Kirsten Dunst, one of our greatest young actresses, is perfect as Mary Jane. Willem Dafoe makes a marvelous villain.My advice? Set aside reality.

His wicked laugh hits the character's behavior right on and Dafoe simply lights up the screen.Other than a few necessary inaccuracies (i.e. natural web shooting without Parker's self made web shooters), the movie stays true to the comic book both in its plot and in its character portrayal.Finally, the ending does the movie justice and sets up for an exciting sequel.Bottom Line: Good movie, worth buying the DVD.",4,An Excellent Start to the Series!,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,854,"[""'Spider-Man"", 'fine', 'job', 'introducing', 'web', 'slinging', 'hero', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'personality', 'well', 'able', 'convey', 'insecurities', 'helplessness', 'beginning', 'film', 'also', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'Peter', 'newly', 'found', 'confidence', 'thanks', 'new', 'superpowers.As', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'too', 'excellent', 'job', 'Norman', 'Osborn/the', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'wicked', 'laugh', 'character', 'behavior', 'right', 'Dafoe', 'simply', 'up', 'screen.Other', 'few', 'necessary', 'inaccuracies', 'i.e', 'natural', 'web', 'shooting', 'Parker', 'self', 'made', 'web', 'shooters', 'movie', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'plot', 'character', 'portrayal.Finally', 'ending', 'movie', 'justice', 'up', 'exciting', 'sequel.Bottom', 'Line', 'Good', 'movie', 'worth', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A

585203,A3ENN25NFADE1X,B00005JKCH,MBrian,"[0, 3]","After viewing ""Spider-Man 2"", I'd discovered that it was POINTLESS to create the first Spider-Man film. This film has many powerful scenes, the death of Uncle Ben, Spider-Man defeating The Green Goblin, and the final scen when Peter Parker tells Mary Jane that he can't be with her.THE WEEKEND THAT MADE HISTORYIn the summer of 2002 I watched every trailer of ""Spider-Man"". It was a great summer, women, going to high school, but I was afraid that ""Spider-Man"" would tank, and people would hate it and it would be the most controversial film ever, why was Sam Raimi directing this film, why was Tobey Maguire playing ""Spider-Man"". This didn't make any sense, Tobey Maguire is a dramatic actor, not an action hero. My cousin and I were thinking this film is going to suck, why didn't James Cameron take a chance to make this film, besides he wanted to write and direct ""Spider-Man"" ten years ago. Oh I forgot, he hasn't directed a film in 8 or 7 years, and it still seems that James is still in love with himself, I mean he's acheived everything that he ever wanted to acheive in cinema.Steven Spielberg, now there's a great director, ""The Color Purple"", ""Shindler's list"", what a director, HE'S ACHEIVED EVERYTHING, and changed cinema forever. But there's A.I., that film wasn't a dissapointment, but who can trust Spielberg now, he may kill Spider-Man by probably the third film, who knows. Martin Scorsese, well he would probably put gangster's in ""Spider-Man"" and that wouldn't be pretty. My cousin and I were contemplating until we had no choice but to wait and see for ourselves.114 million dollarsI took my mom to Regal Cinemas, and it was a great day, it reminded me of the day I saw ""Jurrasic Park"", and ""Titanic"", that peaceful silence, I couldn't even speak, I was so nervouse that this film would suck. In fact I was begging it to suck, I expected Maguire and Raimi to fail. My mom and I got there three hours before the movie started, the longer we stood there, the more the line got longer and longer, and longer. I saw people that were my age and baby-boomers that had waited for ""Spider-Man"" to come to the big screen. I walked in the movie and I was suprised, I was actually happy to see a film, I hadn't felt that way in years. I sat in my seat, the lights got dimed and the film began.After about 2 hours, I realized this was an incredible film, I said that at the time, but after seeing the sequal, ""Spider-Man"" was just an action film, there was no plot, I already knew the story. ""Spider-Man 2"" was a crowning acheivement, it will set the new generation of superhero films, and now I'm looking forward to ""Batman Begins"" cause I want to know more about Batman than any other superhero. ""Spider-Man"" made 114 million dollars in three days and it grossed 403 million dollars in its total run. I think the ""Spider-Man"" saga will probably end up like ""Harry Potter"", the darker the saga gets, the less money the saga makes. Roger Ebert's view of this film was false, this was just the tip of the ice berg, it was setting you up for the epic fights in the sequel and the dramatic scenes that have even surpassed ""Superman"", and will change cinema forever.PS: I was wrong about Tobey Maguire, he's gonna be the best Spider-Man until he reaches age 50.",4,"Good, But Not Great",1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,3266,"['viewing', 'Spider-Man', '2', ""'d"", 'discovered', 'was', 'POINTLESS', 'create', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'film', 'many', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'death', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Spider-Man', 'defeating', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'final', 'scen', 'when', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'her.THE', 'WEEKEND', 'THAT', 'MADE', 'HISTORYIn', 'summer', '2002', 'watched', 'trailer', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'great', 'summer', 'women', 'going', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'afraid', 'Spider-Man', 'would', 'tank', 'people', 'would', 'hate', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'controversial', 'film', 'ever', 'why', 'was', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'directing', 'film', 'why', 'was', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'playing', 'Spider-Man', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'not', 'action', 'hero', 'cousin', 'were', 'thinking', 'film', 'going', 'suck', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'James', 'Cameron', 'take', 'chance', 'make', 'film', 'wanted', 'write', 'direct', 'Spider-Man', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Oh', 'forgot', ""n't"", 'directed', 'film', '8', '7', 'years', 'still', 'James', 'still', 'love', 'mean', 'acheived', 'everything', 'ever', 'wanted', 'acheive', 'cinema.Steven', 'Spielberg', 'now', 'great', 'director', 'Color', 'Purple', 'Shindler', 'list', 'what', 'director', 'HE', 'ACHEIVED', 'EVERYTHING', 'changed', 'cinema', 'forever', 'A.I.', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'dissapointment', 'who', 'can', 'trust', 'Spielberg', 'now', 'may', 'kill', 'Spider-Man', 'probably', 'third', 'film', 'who', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'well', 'would', 'probably', 'put', 'gangster', 'Spider-Man', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'pretty', 'cousin', 'were', 'contemplating', 'had', 'choice', 'wait', 'see', 'ourselves.114', 'million', 'dollarsI', 'took', 'mom', 'Regal', 'Cinemas', 'was', 'great', 'day', 'reminded', 'day', 'saw', 'Jurrasic', 'Park', 'Titanic', 'peaceful', 'silence', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'was', 'so', 'nervouse', 'film', 'would', 'suck', 'fact', 'was', 'begging', 'suck', 'expected', 'Maguire', 'Raimi', 'fail', 'My', 'mom', 'got', 'there', 'three', 'hours', 'movie', 'started', 'longer', 'stood', 'there', 'more', 'line', 'got', 'longer', 'longer', 'longer', 'saw', 'people', 'were', 'age', 'baby-boomers', 'had', 'waited', 'Spider-Man', 'come', 'big', 'screen', 'walked', 'movie', 'was', 'suprised', 'was', 'actually', 'happy', 'see', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'felt', 'way', 'years', 'sat', 'seat', 'lights', 'got', 'dimed', 'film', 'began.After', '2', 'hours', 'realized', 'was', 'incredible', 'film', 'said', 'time', 'seeing', 'sequal', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'just', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'plot', 'already', 'knew', 'story', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'was', 'crowning', 'acheivement', 'will', 'set', 'new', 'generation', 'superhero', 'films', 'now', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'cause', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'Batman', 'other', 'superhero', 'Spider-Man', 'made', '114', 'million', 'dollars', 'three', 'days', 'grossed', '403', 'million', 'dollars', 'total', 'run', 'think', 'Spider-Man', 'saga', 'will', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'darker', 'saga', 'less', 'money', 'saga', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'view', 'film', 'was', 'false', 'was', 'just', 'tip', 'ice', 'berg', 'was', 'setting', 'epic', 'fights', 'sequel', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'have', 'even', 'surpassed', 'Superman', 'will', 'change', 'cinema', 'forever.PS', 'was', 'wrong', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'best', 'Spider-Man', 'age', '50']",N/A

Plus, I recently bought a book on Easter Eggs on DVDs, and this was included - and I still haven't tried to find it!Like all first comic book movies (X-Men etc), I found this film to be slow, as you have to introduce the characters, and for this, discover how Peter Parker got his powers. Like X-Men 2, I'm sure the follow up to Spiderman will be a lot speedier, and will pass quickly. There didn't seem to be much action, and when there was, it was in short bursts. In-between, there's a lot of talk, and it gets a bit tedious.I just didn't see Tobey Macguire as Spiderman. Sure as the geeky little kid he is at the start, but when he removes his glasses, he looks like any ordinary guy. There's nothing special about him as an actor, apart from the fact he sometimes sounds like he's been sucking on helium. There have been many rumours about Jake Gyllenhaal replacing him before this was shot, as Tobey messed up his back, and I would have preferred Jake. But I guess we'll stick with Tobey.Kirsten Dunst struck the right chord as Mary Jane Watson, although she comes across as a bit of a damsel in distress. She'll hopefully have a bigger part in the sequel - it looks like it from the trailer. Her red wig is also extremely fake looking, and I hope she keeps to her word and dyes her hair for the sequels. (And gets extensions - her short hair suits her, but it's so boyish sometimes)Sometimes, I found the CGI to be absolutely awful in this. Sure, it probably would have looked better on the big screen (Titanic's another bad one for this - looks awful on the small screen, but that doesn't stop me watching it!). At some points, it looks more like a computer game, especially when Peter's practising his new found powers, and is running across the roofs of buildings. I didn't see it at the cinema, so I can't say how it looked on the big screen - but probably loads better.As with all these movies, there's bits taken from other comic books, and bits similar looking to other movies. Of course, you had Clark Kent &amp; Lois Lane, and it's the same with Mary Jane &amp; Peter. Also, when you saw Spiderman sitting on top of buildings, there was a strong sense of deja vu, as it's so similar to the shots you see in Daredevil.Of course, nearly every DVD I watch, I spot something connected with Friends. And I did in this! The Moondance Diner that Mary Jane works at, is the same that appeared in the early episodes of Friends (series 2 &amp; 3 I think), where Monica worked.There's absolutely hours of extras to wade through on this, but it's mostly stuff I'm not really into - I like gag reels etc, and the actors messing up their lines, I don't really like going in-depth into how they did the fight scenes etc. These extras are: commentary by director Sam Raimi, Kirsten Dunst, producer Laura Ziskin and co-producer Grant Curtis; commentary by special effects designer John Dykstra and visual effects crew; &quot;Weaving the Web&quot;: subtitled pop-on production notes and historical factsBranching web-isodes; Music videos: Hero (Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott), What We're All About (Sum 41); HBO Making of Spider-Man; Spider-Mania, an E!

585210,A1XIOOXV9LAZXZ,B00005JKCH,"Melissa Ann Minners ""wildkarrde3""","[2, 2]","I missed seeing this movie in the theaters and couldn't wait for it to hit the video stores so I could see what everyone has been talking about.  I'm not a big fan of CGI effects, so I wasn't buying all the hype about them.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that CGI effects have improved greatly.  Although it is still noticable when a digital actor is performing a stunt, the CGI actors are quite well-done.  I was also pleased to see that many fo the stunts were done by the actors themselves - most especially the fight scenes.  It's nice to see that the makers of this film didn't go overboard with all of the effects, remembering that there has to be some acting and a storyline to make the film worth seeing.It should be noted that this is not exactly the Spider-man of the Marvel Comics we all read as kids.  The spider that bites Peter Parker is not radioactive in this movie - just bio-engineered.  Some of the story was altered in a way to make this a modernized version of the comic book tale.  Some other things you should know before seeing the movie:  Spidey's web is not manufactured, but a part of his genetically altered self.  The time-frame of the movie requires that the Peter Parker - Mary Jane Watson relationship develops alot faster.  You know there will be sequels, but look how long it took for Parker and Watson to get together in the comics.Despite some of the changes made to the original story, I loved this film.  I especially liked seeing a more in-depth look at Mary Jane's life outside of the &quot;in-crowd&quot;.  Tobey Maguire's portrayal as the class-nerd-turned-superhero is excellent.  Kirsten Dunst does a great job as Mary Jane.  And what can I say about Willem Defoe's performance as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin?  Superb!  No one will ever top this portrayal of the Green Goblin!  The rest of the cast also does a great job in their roles as well!As far as the special items on the DVD, I haven't had the chance to check them all out, but I will say that the gag section was great.

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[0, 0]","In 2002, theater audiences were treated to what is arguably one of the best superhero-inspired films of all time, ""Spider-Man"", based upon the very popular superhero character created by Marvel Comics.  Directed by Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire was very-well casted to play the shy Peter Parker, turned superhero via a bite from a genetically-enhanced spider.  A high school teenager working as a photographer for his high school newspaper, Peter and his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), who is the son of the wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), travel to a laboratory/museum as part of a science class outing.  Trying to gain the attention of the girl upon whom he has had a long-time crush, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), Peter encourages Harry to talk with Mary Jane.  A missing genetically-altered spider then unexpectedly bites Peter while Harry (instead of trying to get Mary Jane to talk with Peter) starts to take an interest in Mary Jane for himself.  Returning home not feeling well, Peter begins to undergo some changes from the spider bite while Norman Osborn, in an attempt to save a multi-billion dollar government contract for his company, makes the ill-advised decision to undergo a military biochemical experiment upon himself.  Peter discovers his spider-enhanced physical abilities, while Norman Osborn develops a power-hungry alter ego in the form of the Green Goblin.  After graduation, Peter, Harry and Mary Jane seemingly go their separate ways, but the untimely death of Peter's Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) spurs him to become the crime-fighting superhero Spider-Man in time to fight the unscrupulous Green Goblin.With dazzling special effects, good acting and a well-written script, ""Spider-Man"" became an overnight box-office hit earning a record opening-weekend audience.  Tobey Maguire effectively brought to the big-screen the tragic hero figure epitomized by Spider-Man/Peter Parker, as did Kirsten Dunst portray the troubled teenaged girl next door.  Memorable scenes include the school bus, the outing, Norman's lab, Peter practicing, Uncle Ben's last night, the street party, Aunt May's (Rosemary Harris) frightful night, and the battles between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. Overall, I rate the 2002 ""Spider-Man"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to any fantasy/superhero aficionado.",5,"""With great power comes great responsibility.""",1099267200,"11 1, 2004",2004,2355,"['2002', 'theater', 'audiences', 'were', 'treated', 'what', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'superhero-inspired', 'films', 'time', 'Spider-Man', 'based', 'very', 'popular', 'superhero', 'character', 'created', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'Directed', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'was', 'very-well', 'casted', 'play', 'shy', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'turned', 'superhero', 'bite', 'genetically-enhanced', 'spider', 'high', 'school', 'teenager', 'working', 'photographer', 'high', 'school', 'newspaper', 'Peter', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'son', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'Norman', 'Osborn', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'travel', 'laboratory/museum', 'part', 'science', 'class', 'outing', 'Trying', 'gain', 'attention', 'girl', 'whom', 'had', 'long-time', 'crush', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Peter', 'Harry', 'talk', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'missing', 'genetically-altered', 'spider', 'then', 'unexpectedly', 'Peter', 'Harry', 'instead', 'trying', 'get', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'talk', 'Peter', 'take', 'interest', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Returning', 'home', 'not', 'feeling', 'well', 'Peter', 'undergo', 'changes', 'spider', 'bite', 'Norman', 'Osborn', 'attempt', 'save', 'multi-billion', 'dollar', 'government', 'contract', 'company', 'ill-advised', 'decision', 'undergo', 'military', 'biochemical', 'experiment', 'Peter', 'spider-enhanced', 'physical', 'abilities', 'Norman', 'Osborn', 'power-hungry', 'alter', 'ego', 'form', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'graduation', 'Peter', 'Harry', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'seemingly', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'untimely', 'death', 'Peter', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'spurs', 'become', 'crime-fighting', 'superhero', 'Spider-Man', 'time', 'fight', 'unscrupulous', 'Green', 'Goblin.With', 'dazzling', 'special', 'effects', 'good', 'acting', 'well-written', 'script', 'Spider-Man', 'became', 'overnight', 'box-office', 'hit', 'earning', 'record', 'opening-weekend', 'audience', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'effectively', 'brought', 'big-screen', 'tragic', 'hero', 'figure', 'epitomized', 'Spider-Man/Peter', 'Parker', 'did', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'troubled', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'door', 'Memorable', 'scenes', 'include', 'school', 'bus', 'outing', 'Norman', 'lab', 'Peter', 'practicing', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'last', 'night', 'street', 'party', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'frightful', 'night', 'battles', 'Spider-Man', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Overall', 'rate', '2002', 'Spider-Man', '5', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fantasy/superhero', 'aficionado']",N/A

What they don't realize is that Stan Lee originally conceived of Spider-Man as an average sort of person with everyone could relate. As Rosemary Harris as Aunt May says in the film, &quot;You're not Superman.&quot; Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He is of average height, underplays instead of overacts and is just as convincing at playing a high school nerd as he is at playing a super hero.Kirsten Dunst, likewise, is terrific as Mary Jane Watson. With her looks (and body), it would be easy for her to simply physically match the character. However she also manages to embody the character's vulnerability that she hides beneath her confident and charismatic exterior. Having seen very few of her adult roles, I never would have pegged Dunst for the role. However, having seen her in the role, I can't see anyone else playing it.There was much talk about the special effects in Spider-Man as there always seems to be with blockbusters like this. However, to me, the casting is the true strength of the film. Maguire, Dunst, Harris as Aunt May, Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne are all perfectly cast and show that a film can have all the latest technical wizardry, but still must depend on its actors to flesh out the characters and make the audience believe and care about what happens to them.",5,PERFECT casting!,1039132800,"12 6, 2002",2002,1490,"['When', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'heard', 'many', 'people', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Tobey', 'Magurie', 'was', 'cast', 'Web', 'Spinner', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'originally', 'conceived', 'Spider-Man', 'average', 'sort', 'person', 'everyone', 'could', 'relate', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Aunt', 'May', 'film', 'quot', ""'re"", 'not', 'Superman.', 'quot', 'Maguire', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider-Man', 'average', 'height', 'underplays', 'instead', 'overacts', 'just', 'convincing', 'playing', 'high', 'school', 'nerd', 'playing', 'super', 'hero.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'likewise', 'terrific', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'looks', 'body', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'simply', 'physically', 'match', 'character', 'However', 'also', 'embody', 'character', 'vulnerability', 'confident', 'charismatic', 'exterior', 'Having', 'seen', 'very', 'few', 'adult', 'roles', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'pegged', 'Dunst', 'role', 'However', 'having', 'seen', 'role', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'it.There', 'was', 'much', 'talk', 'special', 'effects', 'Spider-Man', 'always', 'be', 'blockbusters', 'However', 'casting', 'true', 'strength', 'film', 'Maguire', 'Dunst', 'Harris', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Norman', 'Osborne', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'show', 'film', 'can', 'have', 'latest', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'still', 'must', 'depend', 'actors', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'make', 'audience', 'believe', 'care', 'what']",N/A

585225,ATNX84AGYIN39,B00005JKCH,"Michael Roffman ""pinball wizard""","[0, 1]","&quot;You do too much, you're not Superman...&quot;No he isn't and thank God, as this super hero is as believable as it gets. What super hero? Your friendly neighborhood Spider-man that is. Peter Parker is Spider-man as everyone already knows and he's as average, even less than average. As branded the &quot;school geek&quot;, Peter Parker succumbs to a load of torment from his fellow peers. His parents died long ago and he lives with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York. In Stan Lee's and Steve Ditko's &quot;The Amazing Fantasy&quot; we learn of the super hero and his origin. In the heart of a scientific lab with radioactive experiments, a spider transmutes with radioactivity and bites his last victim before it dies. This last victim is Peter Parker, the harmless student. Soon after basic encounters such as almost being run over by a car, Peter finds himself able to scale walls and have acute senses, let's not forget amazing agility. A twist from the film, Parker actually engineers web spinners with new cartridges to replace older. He then becomes the infamous Spider-man after becoming a wrestling and showing off his rare fighting abilities. Which leads to the major drama behind the reason for the crime fighting super hero to arise. A robber leaves the building without being apprehended and Parker does nothing to stop it. Little does he know, that same robber turns out to be the murderer of his Uncle Ben. From one he found out it was the thief that killed his uncle, he made a pledge to follow Uncle Ben's statement, &quot;with great power, comes great responsibility.&quot; And that is where Spider-man comes from.In Sam Raimi(Evil Dead, A Simple Plan)'s film take on the beloved comic book series, the premise is equally the same. Minor details are changed in that which Peter doesn't contact the spider bite from a radioactivity lab, but from a lab filled with amazing, genetic spiders. And he also does not create web spinners, but rather &quot;inherits&quot; them. As an avid fan of the comic series and a die hard fan of the character himself, I found these changes to be nothing for me. In fact it seemed more realistic, as I always gawked at the fact that a radioactivity lab would be produced for the likes of high school students. So the changes that everyone has arisen aren't a problem with me, but rather welcomed. But as the story progresses into the 121 minute film, we meet some very serious characters from the books. Norman Osborne(Dafoe), as the villainous Green Goblin, Mary Jane Watson(Dunst), Harry Osborne(Franco), and even Flash Thompson! I was quite surprised Thompson would even be in it, but the addition of him in it added a great variety of scenes. The whole film centralizes very well on each character as the film is basically the carving of the series. It's the true form of which Spider-man becomes and without these centralized themes that revolve around his evolving character, there would be nothing to base feelings toward. Parker's and Osborne's transitions were so wonderfully and delicately played out, you really felt for the characters and understood them to their maximum potential. Especially the very troubled MJ whose family life took a rough transition from her's in the comics. But this transition made her stronger and much more believable. I mean it is New York, not every family is happy go lucky as portrayed by the earlier comics. It's a different time period now, so the changes are necessary and Raimi took the right steps.I'm not going to explain the storyline much as everyone knows that it's the build up of the hero and the enemy on the horizon. But as mentioned before, I've read the comics, and I can assure you it's very true and very entertaining. Seeing Peter's teen angst against Uncle Ben was so remarkable and relatable. Mary Jane's troubled home life and Parker's resilience to let himself open up was so valid. Harry?s conflicting social life with his father, so heartbreaking. In the words of Homer Simpson, &quot;I guess it's all wrapped up in a nice little package.&quot;The directing and writing of the film was also captured brilliantly. David Koepp took the comics to script(with help from Cameron's &quot;treatment&quot;) and made what is thee best super hero film ever. The lines were of things people would ACTUALLY speak about and say. The people were so realistic and the underlines of Norman Osborne's 'change' were scary and ominous. Parker's childish joy and next door neighbor crush were as though I felt I had said stuff like that long ago. The writing really helped the film and even added some very memorable, creepy moments. I won't spoil any for you, but you?ll know when you see it. And let us not forget the &quot;Cabin Boy&quot; himself, &quot;Sam Raimi.&quot; His on the target directing provided some really beautiful shots, especially the ending, that put this film number one for me. The transitions, cinematography, action, etc were all so wonderfully strewn together as if a part of a web itself! Raimi's fine work on &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; which has some of the best cinematography ever really gave him a head start for this film. The choice for Raimi over someone like Fincher or even Cameron was a well adept choice and basically made the film.As always, I'm going to congratulate Danny Elfman on a superb score for the film. His work on &quot;Men In Black&quot;, &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, etc have all had that eerie, yet unknown sense. The contraptions of Norman's sleek, sly and outlandish look were so overly enthralling due to the music that Elfman constructed. He captured the moment in each scene and I really feel he was the best choice for the film and should be duly noted.The themes from the books themselves are quite essential and very valuable to myself. The reflections I have made from the past 470+ comics have really crafted my way of using charisma, action, and inspiration to situations that I endure each day. Spider-man has and always will be my favorite super hero of all time. I would do anything to be in that position and to think of something like that really shows how believable and relatable the character can be. The movie itself moved me, physically as I moved around in the seats with excitement and fear. Yet it also affected me emotionally as I, and many other, could just understand the basic problems people faced in the film. For a super hero movie, which I hate to regard them as, this film takes the cake in the category. But for me, it takes the whole dish in itself. Thee best film I have seen in a long while and probably one of the more memorable ones as well. I not only recommend you to see this film, but I urge you to see it.",5,An older review...,1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,6728,"['quot', 'do', 'too', 'much', ""'re"", 'not', 'Superman', 'quot',

585228,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JKCH,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[0, 0]","Look in the sky! It's a bird ... It's a plane ... Oops! Wrong comic book brand! Even without this comic catch phrase, one can easily say many things about the rising stock of Marvel in the movie industry. It is thanks to the successes of films like Blade and X-Men that finally pushed one of most highly anticipated comic-book adaptations over the top to completion. The movie version of the famous web-slinger has been in development for nearly ten years, mostly due to court battles as well as the lack of enthusiasm by the movie-going public for these types of films. But all the built up anticipation will find a rest as the famous comic-book superhero makes his way to big screen for the first time ever being played by a relatively unknown young actor. Will the fan base accept Columbia's film despite the lack of famous characters in front of and behind the camera? The only thing that can be said is that the ten years of built up hype and anticipation will finally come to end. Whether it will be a glorious success or a tremendous failure is not yet known accept to those that see the film and judge for themselves. Either way, it will be an exciting ride for all those involved.The story centers on the life of the young Peter Parker and the origin of the now famous comic-book superhero, Spider-Man. Peter Parker, a shy and geeky teenager, is raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May after the death of his parents when he was little boy. As far back as he can remember, he has been head over heels for Mary Jane Watson, the girl next door, but he has never gotten the courage to ask her out, let alone talk to her. On what seems to be a normal class field-trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and his whole world is turned upside-down. He quickly notices that his body is changing but as time goes on, he begins to gain control over his new abilities and uses them to win a wrestling match. When he doesn't receive the money from the operator of the wrestling match, Peter ignores the burglar that robs the man at gun point. But when he discovers that the robber later killed his Uncle Ben, Peter devotes his new abilities to fighting crime. Now dubbed Spider-Man, the new superhero must master his abilities perfectly to take down the Green Goblin, who is actually his best friend's father who goes insane from an experiment gone wrong. The story for Spider-Man does a wonderful job of combining romance, action, comedy, and suspense all in beautifully well crafted script that remains consistent despite a couple integrating story lines.At the time of its release, the cast for Spider-Man was a relative bunch of unknowns but each member works well in their own way in this film outside of this handicap. It has to be said that there was quite a bit of hesitation on the part of Sony executives when Sam Raimi, the director, had chosen Tobey Maguire to take on the role of Spider-Man in this high budget feature film. This was quite reasonable considering Maguire had so little real acting experience outside of low budget films like Wonder Boys and Cider House Rules. But those fears can now be put to rest as the young actor proves that he can express vivid emotions even when his face is hidden behind a mask. Kirsten Dunst, who had gained some exposure in films like Jumanji and Bring It On, presents the perfect amount of ""girl next door"" charm that gives the story its real heart, which can only compliment her acting ability within the film. And William Dafoe, who takes on the duo role of Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin, shows true acting talent especially in the scene where Norman argues with his alter self in the mirror and in his mind.Overall, Spider-Man manages to spin a web that is able to capture many integral story elements in an amazingly beautiful pattern that doesn't out do itself. Though the film manages to pull off great things, there are a couple of things to pick at here and there. One of the most prominent examples has to be the musical score conducted by Danny Elfman, who also worked on the soundtrack for another superhero film, Batman. The score is quite unmemorable and doesn't have quite the kick one would expect from this high-profile a feature. Another problem is that some of the scenes with Spider-Man, in costume form, seem too fake compared to other computer effects but this is quite a small complaint in comparison to the rest of the film. The highly anticipated comic-book adaptation has already been declared the movie of the summer before it even has the chance to get out of the gate. Whether the general public makes this statement true or not, Spider-Man is a prestigious effort that gives huge compliments to the filmmakers and all other parties involved in finally bringing this comic-book fanboy vision to the big screen.",4,The Moose Hole -

585229,AURZ4YQ270W3T,B00005JKCH,Mike Freed,"[9, 10]","Watching ""Spider-Man,"" I was reminded of the first time I saw ""Batman."" I walked away from that movie awed by the visuals, but completely unmoved by the characters (even Jack Nicholson's over-the-top performance was a caricature, not a character). But ""Spider-Man"" did something very unusual for films in this genre: it made me care for the people in it far more than I cared for its spectacle.And, in reflection, that's a good thing, since the spectacle here isn't all that spectacular. More about that later - for now, let's just say that ""Spider-Man"" is perhaps the most emotionally involving comic-book movie ever made.That is in no small part due to Tobey Maguire, who is absolutely perfect as the all-too-human Peter Parker, a nerdy young man who is bitten by a ""super spider"" and develops superhuman capabilities. At first, he simply tries to cash in on his newfound powers, as any teenager probably would, but he's reminded tragically that someone who has his capabilities should be using them to better the world, not to rule on ""WWF Smackdown.""This is, of course, the essential ""backstory"" that all comic book characters have, and this one really clicks. Batman is a borderline personality, and Superman is too good for his own good; in ""Spider-Man,"" we have a pretty normal guy who's only abnormal in his capabilities, which makes him darned easy to relate to, and admire.It's all about motivation when it comes to comic books. Batman is motivated by emotional pain, and Superman is motivated by his too-good-to-be-true nature; it's very difficult to see either character's life playing out much differently than they do. But Peter's destiny is chosen, not by his psychological problems or emotional programming, but by himself. He can be what he wants, and he wants to be a super-hero, but more importantly, he chooses to be a super-hero in a way that doesn't hurt his loved ones.This means sacrificing things that most young men wouldn't be prepared to do without, most prominently the love of his life, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). At first, Peter's too shy and insecure to do anything but pine away over her, but as his confidence grows, Mary Jane begins to see him in a different life, and eventually falls for him. But Peter chooses not to make himself avaiable to her for a simple reason: he's made all too aware that the only way to defeat Spider-Man is to hurt his loved ones.The comparisons to other superheroes come up again. Batman is too screwed-up to have a normal relationship, and Superman is physically incapable of one without giving up his powers. But Peter would be perfectly capable of having having a normal love life, and probably would be a heck of a catch for any woman with half a brain, and chooses not to because it would endanger her.There's real humanity and pathos in that decision, and Maguire's performance really brings that out.There's also real humanity in the central villain, Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), a corporate magnate who inadvertently releases a lot more than his physical potential when he tests out his company's performance enhancing drug. His personality splits between the marginally likeable Osborne, and the Green Goblin, who's the kind of villain that likes to roll off long, evil laughs and lines like, ""he must be instructed in pain and loss."" Osborne's son Harry (James Franco) is Parker's best friend, and even after Spider-Man finally defeats him, Osborne's dying wish is that his son never finds out about his secret supervillain side. Of course, Peter, being the honorable guy that he is, honors that dying wish, even when Harry threatens revenge against Spider-Man.How long has it been since we saw a villain in one of these movies with real humanity? Only Lex Luthor, and perhaps Jim Carrey's Riddler, come close. All the rest, including Nicholson's Joker, are just cartoon characters - fun to watch, but ultimately empty and uninvolving.This all makes for a good basic drama, built on nice dialogue and fine performances - a rarity in films of this sort, which almost invariably succeed as spectacle and fail miserably as drama. But ""Spider-Man"" has the opposite problem - it succeeds as drama but fails a spectacle.The fight sequences play well, but whenever Spider-Man takes to the air, and the CGI effects cross the screen, it plays like a video game - flat, graceless, and obvious. Spider-Man looks no more real or graceful than Sonic the Hedgehog, and the effect is even more pronounced on a television screen. Many recent films, notably the latest Star Wars prequel, have shown that CGI can create animation that has real weight, realism and elegance. I don't know any other reason, save budgetary concerns, that would drive the filmmakers to settle for such obvious, silly effects here.In the end, the effects don't ruin this film - the basic goodness of the story and the quality of its telling preclude that - but with better visuals, this would have been a total triumph. As it is, I'm sure that the immense success of this film will enable the producers to hire a more competent visual effects shop for the upcoming sequel.And if that sequel is able to replica the human impact of ""Spider-Man,"" then that movie will truly be something to see.",3,"Scores emotionally, but if only the effects were better...",1061596800,"08 23, 2003",2003,5228,"['Watching', 'Spider-Man',

585230,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00005JKCH,Mike,"[0, 0]","""Spiderman"" (2002)This year's summer blockbusters are actually looking pretty ship-shape! Last year we had the disappointments of such films as Rush Hour 2, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and so on and so forth, but to make up for those, in 2002 we've got Spiderman, Star Wars: Episode II and heaps of other intriguing films being released. Not only do I think this will be one of the best summer blockbusters of this year, I think it could turn out to be one of the most entertaining movies of 2002.I did expect quite a lot from this movie, but it surpassed my expectations beyond my wildest dreams. This movie is such a hard one in which to find fault! I was going to give it a slightly lower grade but then I just couldn't think of any reason not to give it the one I gave it (scroll down). Sure, the movie is cheesy in some places, but duh; it's a comic book adaptation! Of course there's going to be a bit of cheese n' corn. I must be the only person who liked the Green Goblin as a villain. To me he was perfectly menacing and his timing was right-on. I thought the costume would look horrible but it was actually OK.This movie keeps you in suspense (especially during the fair sequence) and surprised me with its genuine wit and heart. There is also one particular little part that made me completely jump out of my seat (watch out for when Willem Dafoe wakes up after being gassed!). The movie brings across some very important messages that not only superheroes should learn. I also liked it the way the movie built up Peter Parker becoming Spiderman because it put a bit of bulk on his character.The acting in Spiderman was terrific. In my opinion, all the actors were perfectly cast. Tobey Maguire is not the sort of guy you'd expect to play a superhero but he pulls it off stunningly, making a great hero and also turning Peter Parker into a likeable and memorable teen. Willem Dafoe reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson with his Green Goblin part. He has a great, evil laugh and his character (when he's not the Goblin) is sort of like a schizophrenic. The scenes where Dafoe is ""talking to himself"" are terrific and very well acted. I thought they would make me laugh but they were actually pretty creepy. Kirsten Dunst is great as Mary Jane, providing her with a heart and personality. Dunst has exactly the right look for the movie, and has some fantastic chemistry with Maguire. I also adored Rosemary Harris in her role as Peter Parker's auntie.The special effects in this movie are terrific. I can't really pick out any key scenes where they were brilliant because I just completely forgot I was watching special effects. They are very realistic. The sound techniques are used effectively, especially in the last 20 minutes or so.One thing I would've liked is for Spiderman to maybe use some more gadgets? We pretty much got the sticky web thing and that was it. Maybe he just has that, I don't know, I've never read the comics (although I sort of want to after seeing this terrific movie). I look forward to seeing how Spidey's super-powers are improved in the next movie.Spiderman is a movie I think everyone will enjoy. It has a big heart and it is always entertaining to watch. It has terrific morals and messages and is able to mix genuine wit and comedy into an action-packed and intriguing storyline. This movie was a lot of fun and I think it'll be one of the biggest grossing movies of 2002, if not, the biggest!

It has some pretty cool special effects and I like the characters for the most part.

This movie is a strange case where I found the plot and character moments much more satisfying and believable than the actual action.As much as I like Willem Defoe, the villan in this movie is HORRIBLE, and the villan in these cheesy flicks is basically a &quot;make or break&quot; point.

Moore,"[1, 1]","Full disclosure: I have never read a Spider-Man comic book, and I avoid reading the daily Spider-Man strip because it annoys me having to feel sorry for a superhero! Here he is with all these wonderful powers, and he gets nothing from them but grief; he's a paragon of goodness, and almost everyone in the world thinks he's a diabolical criminal. I have real people and problems to worry about! Nevertheless, Sam Raimi's movie version of Spider-Man made Spidey and his alter ego, Peter Parker, seem more real to me than I ever imagined they would. The sheer craft of this movie is, of course, incredible; Raimi really makes you feel Peter's astonishment at discovering his new powers, as well as the breathtaking adrenaline rush of web-swinging between skyscrapers. But it is the casting which is this movie's ultimate triumph. Like everyone else, I was doubtful about the casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter/Spidey. Among other things, however nerdy he might be, Peter has always been drawn in the comics as fashion-model handsome, which Maguire most definitely is not. But Maguire is such a pure, emotionally direct actor that he makes you love Peter and ache for him. Kirsten Dunst, perhaps the most talented actress of her generation, is equally lovable as MJ. Willem Dafoe does a brilliant job of playing the Jekyll-Hyde aspects of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin; Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are very moving as Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May; and J.K. Simmons (in the absence of Jason Robards) makes a hilarious blowhard of J. Jonah Jameson. This unquestionably is the best superhero movie ever made.

Tobey Maguire is excellent as Peter Parker, a ordinary teenage boy who only dreams of winning the heart and admiration of the lovely Mary Jane Watson (Who is wonderfully portrayed by Kristen Dunst), his next-door neighbor. While on a field trip to a science lab, Peter is accidentally bitten by an genetically altered (Or is it  radioactive?) spider-and gives our protagonist the ability of a spider! It is enjoyable when we watch Peter discover and develop his special abilities. When his beloved Uncle Ben (Who, with May Parker, had raised Peter since he was orphaned as a child.) is killed, Peter learns that ""with great power, comes great responsibility"" and promised himself  to fight crime as the amazing Spider-Man! The movie is entertaining to watch because the storyline is well written-it is original, creative, and they don't tend to copy from anything. I like when the story has original elements (Unless it is based on a book.). The actors were well chosen. Spidey's web-slinging looked so real-I loved the special effects. The action scenes were awesome, but what I liked most about the movie-had to be Tobey Maguire's performance. No one could have done it any better! One of the things I didn't like-was the Green Goblin's costume. Hello?! It looks like something that came out of the ""Power Rangers"". But that wasn't so important.

His choices resulted in hurting not only people he loved, but the common man and woman.  In addition, the villains always seemed to have more and be respected more than Spiderman ever could.All of these themes and hard points are also covered in the film, which makes it great for comic book fans.  In addition, to make it marketable we've got all the usual CGI effects, as well as some cool scenes and a popular cast (i.e. Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe).SPIDERMAN was suppossedly the highest grossing film for 2002.

585237,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B00005JKCH,mitchell5954,"[0, 0]","Sam Raimi&#8217;s Spiderman is a classic film ushered in a new age of superhero movies.  While X-Men was the film that paved the way for mainstream superhero films, it was Spiderman that truly proved to Hollywood that superheroes are profitable.  Without Spiderman I doubt we would have the chain of superhero films we have now.  While the film definitely has its flaws, in my opinion, the positives out-weigh the negatives.  This film (unlike the reboot) stays true to the spirit of the comics and the character (for the most part).  The film is well-cast for the most part.  It has great action and heart, and most importantly, is wonderfully entertaining.Everyone knows the story.  The first thirty minutes covers the origin story which everyone knows.  The origin of Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tobey McGuire) is about as famous as the origins for Batman and Superman.  Then he has to struggle between his everyday life and being Spiderman.  He is also struggling with feelings with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) as well as stop Norman Osborne/The Green Goblin from wreaking havoc.This film many things right.  I like the story and how everything was setup.  I like that while had the origin they did not spend most of the film on the origin unlike Amazing Spiderman.  Plus it was the first live action Spiderman film so it is more forgivable.  The film stayed true to the comics for the most part from the origin to the rest of the film.  They captured Peter Parker&#8217;s life well.  He struggles to hold a job, he has a hard time keeping his promises, and he struggles between his normal life and his life as Spiderman.  These elements will be explored further in the sequel.  I also like the look of the film.  It has a very timeless feel to it that kind of reminds me of Tim Burton&#8217;s Batman though an entirely different style.  The score also reminded me of Batman with it being composed by Danny Elfman.  With the exception of a few things which I will cover later I think this film captures the spirit of Spiderman well.The cast was, for the most part, very good.  I actually do not mind Tobey McGuire as Peter Parker/Spiderman.  I do have problems with his character in this film, but I blame the writing more than him.  Willem Dafoe was a great choice for Norman Osborne a.k.a The Green Goblin, as was James Franco to play his son Harry.  Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris were the perfect choices for Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  J.K. Simmons is J. Jonah Jameson.  The only casting choice that I did not care for was Kirsten Dunst.  I think she was miscast and really did not resemble Mary Jane from the comic that well.The action scenes are also very well-done and exciting.  Say what you want, but I think the action scenes in this film are far superior to the ones in Amazing Spiderman.  Not-to-mention you do not have to wait for more than an hour to get to the action.  The effects are also well-done for the most part.  Some of the effects look pretty dated but others hold-up well, like the effects of the webs and Spiderman swinging around.  I think the effects in this are just as good as most of the effects in Amazing Spiderman which is, honestly, pretty sad.However, there are several issues with the film.  The major one is Mary Jane as I said earlier.  As much as I hate to admit it there is one thing that Amazing Spiderman has over this film and the other Raimi films is Spiderman&#8217;s love interest.  Gwen is Stacey beats Mary Jane hands down at least as in terms of the movies.  Mary Jane is nothing but a pretty face and someone for Spiderman to rescue.  She is the Lois Lane of Spiderman.  She is like Lois Lane from the early days of Superman.  Even Lois Lane (current version) is a better character than Mary Jane in these films.  She actually has a character.  Mary Jane has no character and she comes off as very petty and kind of a bitch at times as well, especially in Spiderman 3.Plus, her and Peter have no chemistry.  The dialog between them is corny at best.  I do not blame the actors for this.  The script was just poorly written when it came to those moments.  Another problem with this film is some of the dialog.  It is not just the romantic dialog but some of the regular dialog comes off as corny at certain points.  For example, Spiderman confronts the Green Goblin at one point and says: &#8216;It&#8217;s you who is out Goby, out of your mind!&#8221;  Are you kidding me?  Is that the best you could do?  Even as a kid I found that line corny.Another problem is Spiderman himself.  Tobey McGuire plays a great Peter Parker.  Some people might say he is too much of a nerd and not the Peter from the current comics.  However, Sam Raimi is a fan of the old Spiderman from the 60s so that is what he based the movie on.  That is why the film looks the way it does, why all the villains up until Spiderman 3 were all from the original comics, and why Peter is more a nerd and very socially awkward.  McGuire does great playing Peter, but not the best Spiderman.  The costume looks awesome and he looks great in the costume.  However, he is not witty enough.  Spiderman, even in the early days was witty when he had the costume on and was fighting bad guys, because that is how he coped with his situation.  Every now and then he says a witty line but not nearly enough.  Unfortunately we would not get a witty Spiderman until Amazing Spiderman 2 came out.The final issue is with the Green Goblin himself.  I like the Green Goblin as a villain.  He is very fun, intimidating (without the costume), and Dafoe brings a lot of energy to the role.  However, I have two issues with him.  First is his costume, which makes the villain suits in Power Rangers look good.  I know the Green Goblin is a hard character to put in live action.  However, couldn&#8217;t they make something a bit better looking than that?  Secondly, he has no real motivation.  At first he wants to kill the Oscorp board members but he accomplishes that very early on.  Afterward he wants to recruit Spiderman.  Why does he want to recruit him?  We are never told what he wants.Overall, Spiderman is still a classic superhero film despite the reboot.  I do not like how people give this film crap now because of the reboot.  I still like this film and will gladly take it over Amazing Spiderman any day.  It is definitely not perfect, but it captures the spirit of Spiderman more than that film ever did.  If you are a fan of Spiderman, whether it&#8217;d be the comics or the animated series then see this film if you haven&#8217;t already.",4,Spiderman,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,6559,"['Sam', 'Raimi',

Ever since the '70s, studios have tried to get the comic book hero made, but many snags in the process kept it from getting released until 2002.  But with this movie they got it right.  They chose a director with a energetic, comic book style in Sam Raimi and the right actors.  The best is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne, he can be creepy when he needs to be and fanatical when he puts on the Green Goblin suit.  Also a near perfect choice to star in the movie was Toby Macguire.  He fits the persona of the relavtively timid Parker, which is what the film needed, a dominate Peter Parker, not a dominate spiderman.The plot is basically the origins of Spiderman, and his first enemy in the Green Goblin.  But before we see them fight on the rooftops of New York, we get to know the characters,  who they are, and why they are important to the story.  Peter Parker is timid and unsure of himself, Norman Osbourne is a selfmade businessman who sees his company slipping from him, Peters' aunt and uncle are loving and want to see Peter succeed but find it hard sometimes to be the role of substitute parents and Mary Jane seems to be a carefree girl but maybe is really in pain because of a verbally abusive father.  We know them, before the action starts.Then when the action starts, it is eye filling, but not always perfect.  Spiderman swinging from building to building on his web is the best effect, along with his battle to save Mary Jane and a lift full of children on one of Manhattans' bridges.  But the scenes where Peter is jumping from rooftop to rooftop when he first finds out he can, looks a little like it's out of the video game, as with some other shots.But overall, this a movie tht is sure to please you.  The core of the film is rock solid, even if the some of the trappings are a little frayed.  Spiderman does the classic comic book hero justice, and they are many movies that can say they did that, and did it well.",4,It Exceeded my Expecations:  Quality Movie,1041638400,"01 4, 2003",2003,2147,"['Almost', 'anyone', 'associated', 'popular', 'culture', 'America', 'story', 'hero', 'Spiderman', 'A', 'nerdy', 'teen', 'named', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'bitten', 'genetically', 'altered', 'spider', 'thet', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'Ever', ""'70s"", 'studios', 'have', 'tried', 'get', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'made', 'many', 'snags', 'process', 'kept', 'getting', 'released', '2002', 'movie', 'got', 'right', 'chose', 'director', 'energetic', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'right', 'actors', 'best', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Norman', 'Osbourne', 'can', 'be', 'creepy', 'when', 'be', 'fanatical', 'when', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'suit', 'Also', 'near', 'perfect', 'choice', 'star', 'movie', 'was', 'Toby', 'Macguire', 'persona', 'relavtively', 'timid', 'Parker', 'what', 'film', 'needed', 'dominate', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'not', 'dominate', 'spiderman.The', 'plot', 'basically', 'origins', 'Spiderman', 'first', 'enemy', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'see', 'fight', 'rooftops', 'New', 'York', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'why', 'are', 'important', 'story', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'timid', 'unsure', 'Norman', 'Osbourne', 'selfmade', 'businessman', 'who', 'company', 'slipping', 'Peters', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'are', 'loving', 'want', 'see', 'Peter', 'succeed', 'find', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'be', 'role', 'substitute', 'parents', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'be', 'carefree', 'girl', 'maybe', 'really', 'pain', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'father', 'know', 'action', 'starts.Then', 'when', 'action', 'eye', 'filling', 'not', 'always', 'perfect', 'Spiderman', 'swinging', 'building', 'building', 'web', 'best', 'effect', 'battle', 'save', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'lift', 'full', 'children', 'one', 'Manhattans', 'bridges', 'scenes', 'where', 'Peter', 'jumping', 'rooftop', 'rooftop', 'when', 'first', 'out', 'can', 'little', 'video', 'game', 'other', 'shots.But', 'overall', 'movie', 'tht', 'sure', 'please', 'core', 'film', 'rock', 'solid', 'even', 'trappings', 'are', 'little', 'frayed', 'Spiderman', 'classic', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'justice', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'say', 'did', 'did', 'well']",N/A

585244,A2FS6OGMZMALTD,B00005JKCH,Mojo Jojo,"[3, 4]","Let me preface this review by saying I'm a comic book fan, but not a Spider-Man fan.  Scratch that.  I like Spider-Man.  It's that whiny little Peter Parker I could do without.  Now, in the comics this isn't much of a problem.  We spend far more time with Spidey than his alter-ego.  In this film though, Parker dominates.  And every time he stands on screen looking miserable I just start to zone out.Frankly, I just don't feel that bad for him.  The guy gets superpowers and keeps complaining about the terrible responsibility.  I know that's a theme of the comics, but Spidey in the comics always seems to handle it so much better.  His bad luck and poor me attitude never seemed excessively narcissistic.  Here Peter mopes through most of the film, and I reallly got sick of it.On the upside, there's some nice action in this film.  Just not nearly enough of it.  But the Green Goblin looks kind of lame.  And that's saying something in a comic book universe.  It's not a bad film.  Just not very good and overlong.  Am I the only one who's noticed that movies are getting longer without getting better?  Editing makes or breaks a film, and this one could've easily been half-an-hour shorter.Anyway, I've seen it twice and didn't hate it either time.

585245,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00005JKCH,M. Oleson,"[3, 3]","The 2012 reboot of the Spider-man saga has raised some questions in my mind as I read some of the reviews.  I'm not here to belittle the new ""Amazing"" version.  I actually liked it.  But I do have questions as to why it needed to be remade.  Then I started thinking of remakes of ""Let The Right One In"" and ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" and all version are very good.  I hadn't seen the original film for 9 years give or take, so I decided to load the still virgin Blu ray disc into the player.Every once in a while I won't be able to help myself make a comparative observation.  For example, the ""Amazing"" version spends the first hour or so, telling the back story of Peter Parker's parents and their mysterious disappearance.  This is never addressed at all in the 2002 version reviewed here.  Parker (Tobey Maguire) is taunted at school for being a geek, much of that coming from Mary Jane's (Kirsten Dunst) thuggish boyfriend Flash (""True Blood's"" Joe Manganiello).During a field trip to Oscorp's laboratories, Peter gets bitten by a genetically altered spider.  This happens early in the film.  Becoming ill, Peter awakens the next day with perfect eyesight, tossing his previously needed glasses.  He also discovers microscopic barbs on his hands which allow him great gripping power.  You might not remember this but Maguire is also quite toned and fit for this role.  As in ""Amazing"" some of the better scenes involve Parker's adaptation to the ""flying"" ability.  Unlike ""Amazing,"" Maguire's ability to shoot ""webs"" from his wrists is inherent in his genetic change.  For whatever reason the new version has Parker developing some form of mechanical wristband that shoots inorganic cables.  I haven't read the comics so I don't know which version is historically correct, but for me, I like idea of the ""webs"" being organic.Another difference is that Parker wannabe girlfriend in the 2012 version is Gwen Stacy.  In this original movie it is Mary Jane Watson.  Maguire and Dunst have great chemistry and it comes out in their moments together, irrespective of Maguire being Parker or Spidey at the time.  Willem Dafoe, like Maguire, plays two roles in the film.  One is the deposed head of Oscorp and one is the evil Green Goblin, Spider-man's primary foe.  Dafoe teams up once again with the great British actress, Rosemary Harris, who he worked with in 1994's ""Tom and Viv.""  Here Harris is Peter's aunt and she adds some real class to the film.  Her performance here and in Spider-man 2 is truly heartfelt, providing the moral compass to young Parker.J. K. Simmons (""Juno"") is on hand to add some comic relief as the newspaper editor.  His assistant is Elizabeth Banks (""The Hunger Games"").  Also watch for Oscar winner Octavia Spencer (""The Help"") as a clerk at the wrestling match Peter enters to win some money.  And blink-and-you'll-miss-her, Lucy Lawless (TV's ""Spartacus"") shows up as a punk rocker.  The bottom line is that I liked this original Spider-man marginally more than the reboot.  Maybe it was the now iconic upside down kiss between Spidey and M.J.The Blu ray disc has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p HD picture.  Although it shows a bit of grain it is consistent with the original film.  The colors are good and the blacks are black.  The audio is an excellent Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and is really superb.

Everyone enjoys watching an average Joe accomplish greatness. His urge to triumph over the school bully, his desire for the girl he loves, these are elements important to every coming-of-age hero story line. Taking someone in a low place and raising them above everyone's expectations. These are components in making a great hero movie. Spiderman includes them all.

I remember that during every Power Rangers episode (at least the old-school ones), I would wait in suspense until the morph battle at the end. ...the Megazord would take one swift swing at the evil monster with his awesome blade, and the bad guy he would fall dead, helpless to the amazing power of the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. See, what the power Rangers did for me then, Spider-Man does for me now. I didn't just pass the movie off as comic book nonsense. I was like whoa. Spider-Man is the real deal.And, hidden beneath all the wondrous action and comic book drama (which is by no means a bad thing), there's a message from the hero: ""With great power, comes great responsibility."" Spider-man is a modern myth.

IF you're going to compare this with other renditions, don't go.  It's a perfectly wholesome film to get hooked into and I don't care if it was a little smarmy in spots.

585254,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,B00005JKCH,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[2, 6]","Well, I saw Spiderman on opening day and I thought it was good.  Not great, but good.  See when it comes to superheroes, I'm very critical of Spiderman.  I grew up reading Spidey comics thru most of my youth and really have a connection with him.  He's unlike all these other famous superheroes.  Spidey was tempted by material gain and suffered because of it.  But lets talk about the film.  Tobey Maguire played Peter Parker great.  I really thought his performance was very strong.  But the funny thing is, when he changed into Spiderman, something was lacking, and I'm not talking about the costume.  See, Tobey has this sort of wimper in his voice that's great for Peter Parker, but you still can hear it at times when he's Spidey, and that doesn't sit well with me.  Spiderman is a superhero with a sense of humor.  While he's fighting bad guys he uses lots of funny one liners, and I'm not talking campy now.  It's just his way of lightening up the tension of the fact that he could be injured or killed.  At least that's the way I perceived it.  I loved it in fact.  Spiderman is not really cocky, persay, but he's of course not a cream puff either.  I didn't care much for Kirsten Dunst's performance as MJ, but I guess to the average person she was ok.  I just thought see missed out on a lot of who Mary Jane Watson was.  Yeah they included the problems she had growing up with her family, which is true in the comic book, but something was missing in her performance.  Let's talk about the asthetics.  You know, when doing a film about a comic book superhero, things are gonna be condensed.  Hence, many things that took place hundreds of comic book issues apart from one another are used in the film on the same day or practically the same week.  The origin of Spidey was done well.  In fact it was one of my favorite parts of the movie.  I'm still a little unsure about the decision of having his web fluid come from his own body instead of him creating webshooters and web cartridges himself like he did in thecomic book.  Maybe it seemed too farfetched a concept?  I'll give 'em that.  But they do change certain reasons for doing things.  In the film, Peter, now with his newfound powers, wants to impress Mary Jane (MJ) by getting a car.  He sees an add in a newspaper saying &quot;$3000 to wrestle&quot;.  So he goes to take on this mammoth wrestler and beats him, but only receives $100 because he beat him in the first round and the underhandedness is he had to last 3 rounds to earn the $3000.  Well, in the comic book Peter decides to try the wrestling gig to make some money and become famous.  In the comic he receives the full amount of prize money.  They changed it to incorporate this whole love thing between him and MJ, who did not live right next door to him growing up.  Actually she wasn't the girl Peter was interested in during the timeframe that most of the film takes place in.  I guess that's what really annoyed me...the disclusion of Peter's first real girlfriend, Gwen Stacy.  The part in the film that they did get right is that Mary Jane did date Harry Osbourne, but that was while Peter was with Gwen.  To be honest I enjoyed Gwen Stacy a bit more, but I guess I was in the minority in that opinion since she was killed off in the comic book by the Green Goblin, no less.  They changed this in the film of course.  In the comic book, the Green Goblin kidnapps Gwen and taunts Spiderman, holding him at bay, until finally deciding to drop her to her death.  Spidey does get to her before she hits the ground, but the shock of the fall was what killed her.  This was taken from one key comic book (Amazing Spiderman #121) followed by the next issue (#122) where the Green Goblin is killed, by his own doing.  And they did get this right in the film, so that was good.  Some things were dead on, like Norman (Green Goblin) Osbourne discovering Spiderman's secret identity and then making the people Peter loves suffer (he traumatized Aunt May, who did end up in the hospital in the comic book).  I guess I'm such a purist that all these things bothered me more than it would a person who doesn't necassarily read the comic books.  Like I said, it was a good film, but not great.  I'm sure there were a lot of factors involved on why Gwen Stacy wasn't used.  Perhaps three deaths in the film would've been too much (Uncle Ben, Gwen, and the Green Goblin).  I don't know.  But I guess this is the perfect example of what you get when you condense a comic book into movie form.  Oh yeah, and Willem Defoe was quite good as Norman Osbourne.  The costumes were nice, though in the comic book the green goblin's mask was more attatched to his face and not some big helmet that he wore.  Spidey's costume was very impressive.  I also enjoyed the cameos by Bruce (Evil Dead) Campbell as the wrestling announcer and Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) as one of the workers at the Daily Bugle.  I'd still recommend seeing it and buying the DVD which has a lot of nice bonus features.  The nice treat for me was towards the very end of the credits the actual Spiderman theme song from the 60's animated series was played.  It sure beat the crappy rap song that preceded it.  So go see the film and have a good time.  It's not perfect, as comic book fans like myself will atest...but it's a lot of fun!&quot;Spiderman&quot;-bring on the sequels!&quot;You do too much...you're not Superman you know&quot;. - Aunt

After so many comic to movie adaptations, it's hard not to become a little bit weary of 'the next one'. But, here we are, and here we have a movie that actually succeeds in rising above the rest. There hasn't been a comic adapted this successfully since Tim Burton did Batman back in 1989, and Superman before that in 1978 (which sadly bodes that the next one will be in 2011!).Many directors and artists in Hollywood claim to be fans of comic book heroes, but when it comes time for them to actually put it together they fail miserably. But not here. Sam Rami did what a true fan would do - stayed true to the source material - while maintaining the objectivity and realistic approach of a film-maker. But, while cinema demands certain structural devices for reasons of plot and pace, he has captured the essence of Spider-man and his history accurately, and instilled through Tobey Maguire a sense of the excitement that any teenager would feel in Peter Parker's situation.  Perhaps the only thing that disappointed me was the Green Goblin. The design is didn't have it's own identity, instead rendered like a stock ILM creature. There was no need to venture away from the comic designs of old, as the CGI generation of movies are all converging towards the same point of style. The older Green Goblin designs might have imbued a retro feel that set them apart from the rest of the current fare. Raimi, incidentally, also seems to suffer from Burton's inability to shoot clear, cohesive action scenes that last for any sustained period. It's not that he's a bad film-maker, it's just not his thing. One thing I absoluetly LOVED, though, was the inverted kiss, between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, which just oozes with sexuality.The DVD is packed with extras, as you can see. Most of them are interesting enough, although personally, extras have almost lost their appeal, like a novelty, and I find myself simply going for the films that I like, rather than the rest.",4,"Not perfect, but a very good try.",1039996800,"12 16, 2002",2002,2109,"['What', 'can', 'possibly', 'say', 'someone', 'else', ""n't"", 'already', 'movie', 'truly', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'long', 'time', 'Spider-man', 'fan', 'so', 'many', 'comic', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'hard', 'not', 'become', 'little', 'bit', 'weary', ""'the"", 'next', 'one', 'here', 'are', 'here', 'have', 'movie', 'actually', 'rising', 'rest', ""n't"", 'been', 'comic', 'adapted', 'successfully', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'did', 'Batman', 'back', '1989', 'Superman', '1978', 'sadly', 'next', 'one', 'will', 'be', '2011', '.Many', 'directors', 'artists', 'Hollywood', 'claim', 'be', 'fans', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'when', 'time', 'actually', 'put', 'together', 'fail', 'miserably', 'not', 'here', 'Sam', 'Rami', 'did', 'what', 'true', 'fan', 'would', 'do', 'stayed', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'maintaining', 'objectivity', 'realistic', 'approach', 'film-maker', 'cinema', 'demands', 'certain', 'structural', 'devices', 'reasons', 'plot', 'pace', 'captured', 'essence', 'Spider-man', 'history', 'accurately', 'instilled', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'sense', 'excitement', 'teenager', 'would', 'feel', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'situation', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'was', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'design', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'own', 'identity', 'instead', 'rendered', 'stock', 'ILM', 'creature', 'was', 'need', 'venture', 'away', 'comic', 'designs', 'old', 'CGI', 'generation', 'movies', 'are', 'converging', 'same', 'point', 'style', 'older', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'designs', 'might', 'have', 'imbued', 'retro', 'feel', 'set', 'apart', 'rest', 'current', 'fare', 'Raimi', 'incidentally', 'also', 'suffer', 'Burton', 'inability', 'shoot', 'clear', 'cohesive', 'action', 'scenes', 'last', 'sustained', 'period', 'not', 'bad', 'film-maker', 'just', 'not', 'thing', 'One', 'thing', 'absoluetly', 'LOVED', 'though', 'was', 'inverted', 'kiss', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'just', 'sexuality.The', 'DVD', 'packed', 'extras', 'can', 'see', 'Most', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'personally', 'extras', 'have', 'almost', 'lost', 'appeal', 'novelty', 'find', 'simply', 'going', 'films', 'like', 'rather', 'rest']",N/A
585258,A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ,B00005JKCH,"Mr. JKW ""jkw""","[5, 6]","For Spiderfans in know this movie project was something a good 10 to 20 years in the making and I'd dare say, Spider-Man has lived up to its expectations.  Featuring a solid storyline, AWESOME action sequences, CGI and regular special effects this movie, which stayed fairly true to Spider-Man canon with some minor changes, does not disappoint and fully delivers.THE STORY:The movie basically is loosely based on two major Spider-Man storylines:1. The Spider-Man origin story which recounts how Peter Parker, the typical high school nerd receives great powers when he's bitten by an irradiated spider and how, through a horrible personal accident that he could have prevented learns the ultimate lesson of how ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" and2. The Green Goblin Saga which discusses how a crazed billionaire industrialist becomes the homicidal and maniacal Green Goblin, Spider-Man's greatest foe bent on destroying our favorite superhero by any means (including some PERSONAL, close to home attacks) necessary.THE COOL THINGS:1. The action.  First and foremost it is the action that drives this movie.  The first and subsequent fight scenes between Spidey and the Green Goblin are what make this movie a winner.  The action choreography and accurate depiction of both men's fighting styles stay true to the book, including Spider-Man's awesome limber limbs.  The fight scenes between both men (especially the first one) are among the best you will ever see in ANY action movie.2. The effects.  Definitely ranking up their in any Hollywood production are how Spider-Man's web-slinging powers are rendered in this film.  Again, very true to his comic-book depiction you'll marvel at how Spider-Man swings from building to building and how he uses his web powers in battle or to merely ""hang around.""  The DNA effects were cool too.3. The story.  Obviously looking towards future sequels and building a franchise it's a great treat for long-time Spidey followers at how the plot threads are still kept loose with Harry Osbourne and Spider-Man and the budding relationship of Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker at the end.  Also included are brief potential looks ahead for future villains with the mention of ""Dr. Conners.""NITPICKING:Looking at some discrepancies between the comics and the movie we have:1. The Web Shooters:  In the movie Peter generates his own webs internally.  In the comics he builds web shooters to shoot webs.2. The origin story.  The movie features a robber/carjacker.  The comic has a robber/burglar.3. The origin story.  The movie features wrestler Bonesaw McGraw (played by Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage.  The comic features wrestler Crusher Hogan (which undoubtedly somehow influenced legendary wrestler Hulk Hogan).4. The Goblin Saga.  The comics featured Spider-Man's first true love Gwen Stacy getting caught up in the super-hero struggle.  The movie revolves around eventual Spider-Man resident female love interest, Mary Jane Watson(-Parker).THE VERDICT:Overall, this is the film that Spider-fans have waited their whole lives for.  The action, effects and story are solid with enough hanging plot threads that will make long-time fans anxiously await the sequel.While some of the changes between comic and movie may have hardcore fans a little uppity, the changes are minor enough to let by and the rest of the movie's great points should put aside any other worries.Overall, Spider-fan or not, this is definitely not a movie you'll want to miss.Highest Recommendation",5,The Wait Was Worth It,1021334400,"05 14, 2002",2002,3513,"['Spiderfans', 'know', 'movie', 'project', 'was', 'something', 'good', '10', '20', 'years', 'making', ""'d"", 'dare', 'say', 'Spider-Man', 'lived', 'up', 'expectations', 'Featuring', 'solid', 'storyline', 'AWESOME', 'action', 'sequences', 'CGI', 'regular', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'stayed', 'fairly', 'true', 'Spider-Man', 'canon', 'minor', 'changes', 'not', 'disappoint', 'fully', 'delivers.THE', 'STORY', 'movie', 'basically', 'loosely', 'based', 'two', 'major', 'Spider-Man', 'storylines:1', 'Spider-Man', 'origin', 'story', 'how', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'nerd', 'great', 'powers', 'when', 'bitten', 'irradiated', 'spider', 'how', 'horrible', 'personal', 'accident', 'could', 'have', 'prevented', 'ultimate', 'lesson', 'how', 'Great', 'Power', 'Comes', 'Great', 'Responsibility', 'and2', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Saga', 'how', 'crazed', 'billionaire', 'industrialist', 'homicidal', 'maniacal', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Spider-Man', 'greatest', 'foe', 'bent', 'destroying', 'favorite', 'superhero', 'means', 'including', 'PERSONAL', 'close', 'home', 'attacks', 'necessary.THE', 'COOL', 'THINGS:1', 'action', 'First', 'foremost', 'action', 'movie', 'first', 'subsequent', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Spidey', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'winner', 'action', 'choreography', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'men', 'fighting', 'styles', 'stay', 'true', 'book', 'including', 'Spider-Man', 'awesome', 'limber', 'limbs', 'fight', 'scenes', 'men', 'especially', 'first', 'one', 'are', 'best', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'ANY', 'action', 'movie.2', 'effects', 'Definitely', 'ranking', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'are', 'how', 'Spider-Man', 'web-slinging', 'powers', 'are', 'rendered', 'film', 'Again', 'very', 'true', 'comic-book', 'depiction', ""'ll"", 'marvel', 'how', 'Spider-Man', 'swings', 'building', 'building', 'how', 'web', 'powers', 'battle', 'merely', 'hang', 'around', 'DNA', 'effects', 'were', 'cool', 'too.3', 'story', 'Obviously', 'looking', 'towards', 'future', 'sequels', 'building', 'franchise', 'great', 'treat', 'long-time', 'Spidey', 'followers', 'how', 'plot', 'threads', 'are', 'still', 'kept', 'loose', 'Harry', 'Osbourne', 'Spider-Man', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'end', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'brief', 'potential', 'looks', 'ahead', 'future', 'villains', 'mention', 'Dr', 'Conners', 'NITPICKING', 'Looking', 'discrepancies', 'comics', 'movie', 'have:1', 'Web', 'Shooters', 'movie', 'Peter', 'own', 'webs', 'internally', 'comics', 'web', 'shooters', 'shoot', 'webs.2', 'origin', 'story', 'movie', 'robber/carjacker', 'comic', 'robber/burglar.3', 'origin', 'story', 'movie', 'wrestler', 'Bonesaw', 'McGraw', 'played', 'Randy', 'Macho', 'Man', 'Savage', 'comic', 'features', 'wrestler', 'Crusher', 'Hogan', 'undoubtedly', 'somehow', 'influenced', 'legendary', 'wrestler', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', '.4', 'Goblin', 'Saga', 'comics', 'featured', 'Spider-Man', 'first', 'true', 'love', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'super-hero', 'struggle', 'movie', 'around', 'eventual', 'Spider-Man', 'resident', 'female', 'love', 'interest', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', '-Parker', 'VERDICT', 'Overall', 'film', 'Spider-fans', 'have', 'waited', 'whole', 'lives', 'action', 'effects', 'story', 'are', 'solid', 'enough', 'hanging', 'plot', 'threads', 'will', 'make', 'long-time', 'fans', 'anxiously', 'await', 'sequel.While', 'changes', 'comic', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'little', 'uppity', 'changes', 'are', 'minor', 'enough', 'let', 'rest', 'movie', 'great', 'points', 'should', 'put', 'aside', 'other', 'worries.Overall', 'Spider-fan', 'not', 'definitely', 'not', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'miss.Highest', 'Recommendation']",N/A

The characters were cast fairly well with Tobey McGuire being the possible only question mark.  Willem Dafoe is solid as the Goblin and the rest of the cast does their parts pretty well.  I like the build-up of the Spiderman story and how things came about.  The film was paced decently and didnt rush into anything too quickly or drag on too slowly.  The action scenes were OK, nothing great but I've seen worse.  The CGI was acceptable but the transitions from CGI to Live action were a little hacked up.  Basically, the special effects were borderline acceptable but this didnt hurt the film too much.I did enjoy the story development and the characters did progress enough to keep it interesting. Of course the ending was setup for the next film.  As others have said, the ending was not the best.... oh well.... nothing is perfect.Despite a few scenes with some violence it is kid-friendly as well and the reviewers that trash the film need to understand that a PG-13 film needs to fall within certain criteria and they simply cannot go overboard with violence or sex stuff.  The action scenes are softer than some other films and the bad guys are not geniuses either.  Again, its PG-13 follks... go watch some R-rated bloodfest if thats your desire.I would have preferred 3.5 stars but gave a it a 4 just because films like this are NOT easy to do well since there are so many ""bombs"" out there. Overall, this is well acted, well executed, and keeps you interested which is pretty good for Comic Book movies that usually are awful ( Hulk, Batman ).So go ahead and watch it, maybe even buy it if you're into the genre.Recommended!",4,"Better than I thought, Good overall Comic-based movie....",1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,1837,"[""'m"", 'not', 'Super-hero', 'movie', 'type', 'love', 'Superman', 'movies', 'least', '1', '2', 'also', 'had', 'interest', 'Spiderman', 'gave', 'film', 'shot.Well', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'characters', 'were', 'cast', 'fairly', 'well', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'being', 'possible', 'only', 'question', 'mark', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'solid', 'Goblin', 'rest', 'cast', 'parts', 'pretty', 'well', 'build-up', 'Spiderman', 'story', 'how', 'things', 'came', 'about', 'film', 'was', 'paced', 'decently', 'didnt', 'rush', 'anything', 'too', 'quickly', 'drag', 'too', 'slowly', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'OK', 'nothing', 'great', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'CGI', 'was', 'acceptable', 'transitions', 'CGI', 'Live', 'action', 'were', 'little', 'hacked', 'up', 'Basically', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'borderline', 'acceptable', 'didnt', 'film', 'too', 'much.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'story', 'development', 'characters', 'did', 'progress', 'enough', 'keep', 'interesting', 'course', 'ending', 'was', 'setup', 'next', 'film', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'oh', 'well', 'nothing', 'perfect.Despite', 'few', 'scenes', 'violence', 'kid-friendly', 'as', 'well', 'reviewers', 'trash', 'film', 'need', 'understand', 'PG-13', 'film', 'needs', 'fall', 'certain', 'criteria', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'overboard', 'violence', 'sex', 'stuff', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'softer', 'other', 'films', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'geniuses', 'either', 'Again', 'PG-13', 'follks', 'go', 'watch', 'R-rated', 'bloodfest', 'thats', 'desire.I', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', '3.5', 'stars', 'gave', '4', 'just', 'films', 'are', 'NOT', 'easy', 'do', 'well', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'bombs', 'there', 'Overall', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'executed', 'interested', 'pretty', 'good', 'Comic', 'Book', 'movies', 'usually', 'are', 'awful', 'Hulk', 'Batman', '.So', 'go', 'ahead', 'watch', 'maybe', 'even', 'buy', ""'re"", 'genre.Recommended']",N/A
585261,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JKCH,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[21, 27]","Spiderman was one of the most eagerly awaited movies of 2002, which is a lot of baggage to carry when setting out to make an adaptation of one of the most popular comic strips ever.  However, with Sam Raimi safely entrusted with the responsibility of Directorial duty and the excellent casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, this movie always looked a sure-fire winner and indeed it is exactly that.As everybody knows Spider-man's alter ego Peter Parker is that anonymous boy next door, the boy who never gets the girl and whom the girl doesn't even notice. He's as pure as the driven snow, devoted to his Aunt and Uncle, the boy for girls to take home to their mother, safe, kind but somewhat unexciting.  Bullied at school, he is the butt of everyone's jokes and regarded as something of a nerd, a bit of a loser. However, after being bitten by a genetically modified spider, Peter transforms overnight from anonymous boy next door to super hero in this good guys can come first comic-book tale.There are so many good things about Spider-man it is hard to know where to start. First off, what I found most impressive and refreshing was the screenplay, which unlike most major Hollywood studio major event movies actually relies on narrative, plot and character development to tell the story instead of just loosely sewing together action scenes with meaningless dialogue (Simon West are you listening?). Credit for this should go to writer David Koepp and Director Sam Raimi for avoiding this obvious pitfall that has spoilt many a summer blockbuster (such as Tomb Raider to give but one example). Raimi's direction is sure-footed and subtle and the decision to give him megaphone duties has proven to be well vindicated. The casting of Tobey Maguire is another masterstroke because Tobey Maguire is undoubtedly one of the most talented young actors around with a CV of critically acclaimed performances in critically acclaimed movies, that seasoned veterans would be proud of, such as; Ride With The Devil, Pleasantville, The Ice Storm, The Wonder Boys and The Cider House Rules. With Mr Maguire as Peter Parker we get performance of depth and subtlety of a teenager struggling with more than the normal transformation from boy to man. Kirsten Dunst (Drop Dead Gorgeous, The Virgin Suicides) is also a spectacular success with her girl next-door looks and range and depth of emotion and ability, as is Willem Dafoe (Platoon, Light Sleeper etc.) in the villainous role of the Green Goblin, carefully avoiding too much ham.All that said there are some faults. For example, some of the web-slinging CGI is a disappointment and up close the green goblins headgear is a bit rubbish.  Spider-Man is also apparently (according to all the geeks) littered with continuity errors but much of that can perhaps be explained by the devastating happenings of September 11th and several scenes featuring the twin towers, including an apparently superb sequence with the villain's helicopter getting caught in webbing between the Twin Towers had to be cut, along with the relevant narrative. Plus the final scenes where a crowd of New Yorkers hurl objects at the Green Goblin has a definite tagged on feel to it but the who can blame them for it's addition is entirely appropriate and rightly captures the spirit of NYC in the aftermath of 9/11: ""Ya take one of us on, ya take us all on!"" shouts one patriotic New Yorker. Ending with our favourite web-slinger against the backdrop of the stars and stripes, Spider-Man is a resounding success and with Raimi, Maguire and Dunst all signed up for the sequel, I personally cant wait for Spider-Man 2.",4,SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER WITH AN IQ!!!,1030147200,"08 24, 2002",2002,3674,"['Spiderman', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'movies', '2002', 'lot', 'baggage', 'carry', 'when', 'setting', 'out', 'make', 'adaptation', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'comic', 'strips', 'ever', 'However', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'safely', 'entrusted', 'responsibility', 'Directorial', 'duty', 'excellent', 'casting', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'movie', 'always', 'looked', 'sure-fire', 'winner', 'indeed', 'exactly', 'that.As', 'everybody', 'Spider-man', 'alter', 'ego', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'anonymous', 'boy', 'door', 'boy', 'who', 'never', 'girl', 'whom', 'girl', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'as', 'pure', 'driven', 'snow', 'devoted', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'boy', 'girls', 'take', 'home', 'mother', 'safe', 'kind', 'somewhat', 'unexciting', 'Bullied', 'school', 'butt', 'everyone', 'jokes', 'regarded', 'something', 'nerd', 'bit', 'loser', 'However', 'being', 'bitten', 'genetically', 'modified', 'spider', 'Peter', 'transforms', 'overnight', 'anonymous', 'boy', 'door', 'super', 'hero', 'good', 'guys', 'can', 'come', 'first', 'comic-book', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'Spider-man', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'start', 'First', 'off', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'impressive', 'refreshing', 'was', 'screenplay', 'most', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'major', 'event', 'movies', 'actually', 'narrative', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'tell', 'story', 'instead', 'just', 'loosely', 'sewing', 'together', 'action', 'scenes', 'meaningless', 'dialogue', 'Simon', 'West', 'are', 'listening', 'Credit', 'should', 'go', 'writer', 'David', 'Koepp', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'avoiding', 'obvious', 'pitfall', 'spoilt', 'many', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'such', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'give', 'one', 'example', 'Raimi', 'direction', 'sure-footed', 'subtle', 'decision', 'give', 'megaphone', 'duties', 'proven', 'be', 'well', 'vindicated', 'casting', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'masterstroke', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'young', 'actors', 'CV', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'performances', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'movies', 'seasoned', 'veterans', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'such', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'Pleasantville', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'Mr', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'get', 'performance', 'depth', 'subtlety', 'teenager', 'struggling', 'more', 'normal', 'transformation', 'boy', 'man', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'also', 'spectacular', 'success', 'girl', 'next-door', 'looks', 'range', 'depth', 'emotion', 'ability', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Platoon', 'Light', 'Sleeper', 'etc', 'villainous', 'role', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'carefully', 'avoiding', 'too', 'much', 'ham.All', 'said', 'are', 'faults', 'example', 'web-slinging', 'CGI', 'disappointment', 'up', 'close', 'green', 'goblins', 'headgear', 'bit', 'rubbish', 'Spider-Man', 'also', 'apparently', 'according', 'geeks', 'littered', 'continuity', 'errors', 'much', 'can', 'perhaps', 'be', 'explained', 'devastating', 'happenings', 'September', '11th', 'several', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'twin', 'towers', 'including', 'apparently', 'superb', 'sequence', 'villain', 'helicopter', 'getting', 'caught', 'webbing', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'had', 'be', 'cut', 'relevant', 'narrative', 'final', 'scenes', 'where', 'crowd', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'hurl', 'objects', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'definite', 'tagged', 'feel', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'addition', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'rightly', 'spirit', 'NYC', 'aftermath', '9/11', 'take', 'one', 'ya', 'take', 'one', 'patriotic', 'New', 'Yorker', 'Ending', 'favourite', 'web-slinger', 'backdrop', 'stars', 'stripes', 'Spider-Man', 'resounding', 'success', 'Raimi', 'Maguire', 'Dunst', 'signed', 'up', 'sequel', 'personally', 'cant', 'wait', 'Spider-Man', '2']",N/A

It isn't because even people who have never picked up a SPIDER-MAN comic book know that Peter Parker got his powers from a bite from a radioactive (or, in the context of the movie, mutant) spider. It isn't because the popularity of the character made sure that every living person on the planet would sooner or later see the SPIDER-MAN movie.It's because what's worth talking about in a review of the SPIDER-MAN movie is the fact that the characters as well as the comic itself have been done justice. SPIDER-MAN is one of the most iconic, beloved, and enduring creations in comics, and in many ways, embodies all of the most essential qualities of a superhero.

In my opinion, this movie was so hyped up in such a way that it could not possibly live up to expectations, including my expecations. The storyline reminds a B movie.The storyline concerns high schooler Peter Parker, who is definitely not on the ""A-list"" at his school. He is unpopular, and feels out of place as he tries to impress the girl of his dreams. Then, one fateful day, his life is changed forever when, during a field trip through a spider-breeding lab, a genetically altered spider bites him. He then finds that his physical body has been enhanced, and eventually, he becomes half spider. He harnesses the ability to climb walls and skyscrapers, and leap far distances. He also finds he is able to shoot extremely strong web strings. Then, an archenemy arises, the Green Goblin, who is determined to kill Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man. Meanwhile, the media going wild with news stories of strange appearances Spider-Man and the Goblin. Throughout the movie Spider-Man uses his powers to rescue his girlfriend from various dangers. The climax features a big showdown between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, a hand-to-hand combat sequence. The film ends with a somewhat bittersweet ending. The ending makes it obvious that the doors are wide open for a Spider-Man 2.Although Spider-Man wasn't a movie that met expectations exactly, it's still worth seeing.

The first route is the movie will be utterly disappointing and lacking any of the intensity from the book it is adapted from (see the Spawn live action film for example), while the second route is a riveting, very well put together film that carries the essence of the comic (the original Superman and Batman and the Blade series).  Spider-Man isn't the best comic adaption to film, but this long awaited movie more than delivers the goods.  Tobey Maguire is rather good and believeable as Peter Parker and Spider-Man and seems to be a great choice for the role in the future films, while Kirsten Dunst is as stunning as ever as Mary Jane Watson.  James Franco perfectly captures the personality and insecurity of Harry Osborne, while Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are very good as well as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  But the best casting and performance goes to Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborne, he is absolutely perfect as the maniacal schizo and is clearly having a lot of fun in his role, while an almost as perfect performance by J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who is perfectly cast and looks just like the character does in the comic.  Director Sam Raimi (director of the cult classics Evil Dead Trilogy and the original Darkman) directs with his usual stylish flair (along with some shameless corporate promotions) and is a great example of how to make a comic adapted film with a director who knows the comic...

585270,A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ,B00005JKCH,Negative Comments,"[1, 1]","What an odd way to describe a Spider-Man movie of all things huh? Well, let me explain.After I saw Spider-Man 3 in 2007, the disgusting display of incompetent film making and lazy attempts to make money and simply get by on the name alone, left me with nothing but a raging hatred in my core for everyone involved in that abomination of a movie. Watching part 1 again reminded me of how magnificent this franchise used to be. I can't believe these characters that I fell in love with- Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Harry, J. Jonah Jameson, are people that I actually wanted to commit felony acts of violence against in part 3 (particularly Mary Jane and Harry). It was so bad and personal, that I even said that if they continue making more Spider-Man movies in the future, that I would like nothing more than Kirsten Dunst NOT to return (a complete contrast to my views of her in parts 1 and 2, where I loved her). Seeing part 3 even made me second guess myself as to whether the first two actually deserved perfect 10s as I originally scored them. Well, seeing them again reminded me that they ABSOLUTELY deserve 10s, and that's why I'm writing this review. I'll stick to talking about part 1 here.**Great job adapting the comic to the big screen. They captured the campy humor of the comics perfectly, with lovable corny one-liners done just well enough to be corny, but not excessively that it becomes a joke.**At it's core, this movie is basically a love story about a nerd awkwardly trying to win over the girl he loves, with things getting a tad bit complicated having to deal with the fact that he's got superhuman powers. This is a romance story story running parallel to a superhero movie, and it's interwoven with expert craftsmanship, it completely engrosses you.**I've gotta give it to Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, they did some great acting here. All of their scenes feel so genuine. Who can't relate to those little moments that they had together? Like every time they happen to meet up by chance, they would say ""Oh hey!!!"" with a genuine look of surprise as their faces light up with happiness, followed by awkward, nervous conversation masked by their smiles, with Peter consciously making sure to minimize dead air in the conversation. Again, the most authentic thing in all of this is the ""oh hey!!!"" part. Not sure about everyone else, but in my experience, this is THE default greeting between a male and a female that are moderately close, upon unexpectedly meeting each other (less close could result in a simple, less upbeat, ""hey what's up,"" and more close could be running up and giving them a hug).**There's a certain *simplistic nature to this movie that you become fond of. There's a very dense, linear approach that pretty much forces you to love the characters, and want to see the nerd win the girl, and save the day.**If I had to do one thing differently, I would change the Green Goblin's costume. It was too over the top and cartoonish, they should've modernized the look, make it look like something that would be issued by the military for combat. They wouldn't wear a mask that looked like that..Parts 1 and 2 compared to part 3 are like day and knight.

585272,A20ZFWGBY4REFX,B00005JKCH,"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan""","[9, 12]","Who is he? You sure you want to know? Tobey Maguire (""The Cider House Rules""), one of the finest young actors today, is...""Spider-Man""! I have seen this film twice at the theater and I can't get enough of it! ""Spider-Man"" is smart, funny, and action-packed all the way from start to finish! The director of this film, Sam Raimi (""Darkman""), did not just a great job, but an outstanding job in bringing this Marvel comic book adaption to life on the big screen! I am sure that everyone knows the story of Spider-Man and that he needs no introduction. But for those who don't, then here it is. ""Spider-Man"" focuses on Peter Parker (Maguire), a mild-mannered high school student who lives with his aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) in Queens, New York. Peter is in love with a beautiful, yet stunning young lady named Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who has lived next door to Peter since they were little. One day, during a field trip to a laboratory involving the research of spiders, Peter accidentally gets bitten by one of the spiders. But to me, this was a blessing as Peter started to develop these powers and abilities to move and think like a spider, such as shooting webs from the wrist, climbing up walls, etc. And before you know it, Peter Parker is now the amazing ""Spider-Man""! During the movie, Peter learns an invaluable lesson from his uncle Ben: ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". And soon enough, the abilities of Peter/Spider-Man will be put to the ultimate test as he faces his greatest challenge yet...the villainous Green Goblin, whose alter ego is an ambitious, yet ruthless businessman named Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), who also has a somewhat frustrated son named Harry (James Franco), who is also Peter Parker's best friend. And the movie goes on from there with lots of explosive action and then some! Let me just say that I think that they have picked the right actor for the role of Spider-Man, and that I have to give a lot of credit to Tobey Maguire for his physical abilities and his unique sense of acting that brought him to the role of a lifetime. I also have to give a lot of credit to Willem Dafoe for his role of the Green Goblin. Dafoe is at his villainous best since Ian McKellen's Magneto in 2000's ""X-Men""! And the credit also goes to Kirsten Dunst for her very sweet performance as Mary Jane, and to Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Peter's guardians throughout the years.

When I first heard about it last summer, I thought it would be a cheap PG kids movie that only costed [$] to make. I was so wrong. Turns out they actully paid [$] to make this movie, and it is PG-13. Not just for kids. The special effects are great. I could watch Spider-Man web-sling all day. It looks so real, the movements of his body and the way his muscles move. I mean, it probably IS REAL!! Which is what I would've believed if it weren't for Green Goblin. Don't get me wrong; he's one of the best supervillians I've ever seen. But, his costume looks PLASTIC! But, still, he looks really good when he's flying with his glider. Another thing I was suprised at was the action-sequences between Goblin and Spidey.

585276,A3KIQ7YZ765WYU,B00005JKCH,Nomee Ansari,"[1, 1]","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is a movie which may actually appeal more to casual fans of Spider-Man, than fans of the comic book. While writing this review I thought of casual and hardcore fans, though I did not think of non-fans. I mean, no one will accidentally walk into the Spider-Man movie.The movie follows the earlier legend of Spider-Man rather than the revised story of the Ultimate Spider-Man comic books. However the storyline the Spider-Man movie follows, follows well, and establishes the origin story of Spider-Man very faithfully to the comic books. Toby Maguire is excellent as Peter Parker, and is very convincing as a young man coming to terms with his superpowers. Kirsten Dunst is also quite good in her role as Mary Jane, while Willem Dafoe is quite a good Norm Osborn. However the best acting performance came from J.K. Simmons as J. Joanah Jameson, who is quite hilarious in his performance.The script is also well written; at times very funny and at other times very touching. When it comes to establishing Peter Parker and Norm Osborn, the Spider-Man movie succeeds fantastically. It is amazingly touching and its characters feel surprisingly human. However when it comes to establishing the character of Spider-Man, the movie falters a bit. Spider-Man in his costume never feels joyful or at all like the smart mouthed Spidey we know. Unfortunately he hardly speaks, and is far too mysterious. I mean this attitude is great for someone like Batman, but certainly not suited to Spider-Man. Any fan of Spider-Man knows that Spidey is full of one-liners and wisecracks. Unfortunately in the movie, Spider-Man is too quiet and believes in action rather than words.I must admit to the fact that the special affects are fantastic. And even though the joy of being Spider-Man is never fully established through dialogue it is thoroughly established through action. Spider-Man looks fantastic swinging past fast moving vehicles, and doing Matrix like moves. The scenes where he utilizes his abilities, are especially well done. All in all the Spider-Man movie is a visual feat, and its unmasked characters are extremely well developed.If I compare it to other superhero movies, I'd put this one behind the Superman and Batman movies. What those movies had though, was a great soundtrack, which the Spider-Man movie sorely misses. Also, those movies' superheroes had a lot of heart when they were in their costumes, while Spider-Man seems too robotic, much like Al-Gore. Like Batman, Superman, and The X-Men movies, Spider-Man does a good job when it comes to the character development of its unmasked hero. In fact I'd take it a step further, and say that Peter Parker is as well developed as Clark Kent was. Unfortunately as Spider-Man, he is more like Al-Gore than Spider-Man. Perhaps the problem was that Peter Parker was still new to being Spider-Man, and had not yet developed his Spider-Man personality. I think that that was the movie's only problem, it's Peter Parker lacked character when he put on the Spider-Man suit.I don't want to close on a negative though. The Spider-Man movie is quite good. It features some good character development, some superb action, witty dialogue (from everyone except for the webslinger), and great direction.

Sure, the serious afficionado can find some details to quibble over, but overall I was very impressed with the way the Spiderman legend was brought vividly to life.  I especially enjoyed the way the actors were made to look just like their comic book counterparts.  Even better, the outlandish story lines from the comics were actually imbued with an air of -- dare I say it? -- plausibility.  In short, it's everything I had hoped for in this kind of film, and then some.For all you ""serious"" movie critics out there who want to overanalyze this movie, just get over yourselves!

I saw the movie 2 more times in theaters, then rushed and bought the DVD on opening week (sold out the first few days). After viewing everything, here's what I thought:First off, the movie: I loved this movie, and is one of the top 3 of my favorites ever! The story goes a lot with the old comic books. A kid by the name of Peter Parker is the main character. Through his whole life, he has had a crush on a girl next door named Mary Jane. He's always been a bit shy and for that matter; geeky and never really talked to her. On a school field trip, Peter is bitten by a geneticly enganeered spider. The spider gives him super-human powers like a spider, and he doesn't know what to do with them. That's when one night, his uncle (he lives with his aunt and uncle) is shot by a burglar and dies on the very street. That's when Peter knows who he must become. He uses his abilities (web sling, incredible strength, and super-human speed and senses) to fight evil. His first openant: his uncle's killer. From that day on, Spider-man must fight off evil. A trully great start.Now, after getting his powers, a person (a few miles away) by the name of Norban Osborne is testing a human enhancer drug. The drug makes his mind go mad, and while he does get the enhancers affects, he also gets a criminals attitude. The whole movie is basicly these two fighting. Pretty boring right? No, not at all. Because the villain (green goblain) is willing to do anything to win, and in this case, finds out Spider-man's true identity and...you'll have to see.What made this movie so great was A. The romance between Mary Jane and Spider-man and wonderful acting all around and B. Perhaps the best graphics ever seen in a movie. Everything seems so real that you can't really tell it's special affects. I, toward the end of the movie, really felt like it was possible (which it really isn't). Like there could be a Spider-man out there somewhere. The city landscacpes and swinging is just incredible. Explosions, realism, web, destruction, everything makes this movie so real and exciting...So if u like a good romance, lots of action, incredible graphics, and a ton of fighting (with a little humor) Spider-man is for u. Millions of people did not flock to theaters again and again for nothing. This was a great movie, with a great ending that sets up for...should I give it away?...Spider-Man 2 (set for realease about 2004)The extras: Tons! The making of the movie, messups, a free demo of the PC game of Spider-man, staff thoughts, and a lot lot more. This DVD was awsome, and brings u the blockbuster hit that rocked theaters all over the world last summer.Overall, u should get this DVD. For the movie, the extras, and because of just how good it is. If your still not convinced, rent it on video. Then you'll c y u have to get Spider-man: The Movie; a classic of the future (in my opinion).I hope this helped, and I know that I love and can't get enough of Spider-man",5,Awsome Movie!!!

There are a number of reference points for Spider Man, and it doesn't measure up to any of them:Firstly, adapting a comic strip to the big screen: Since Christopher Reeve brought us Superman-con-fromage, action heroes have all but infested the cinema, mostly with substandard results: The best of the bunch was the Batman franchise, which (at least while in Tim Burton's capable hands) took a fairly cornball & camp idea and extracted a far darker, more gothic essence. Sam Raimis does nothing of the sort here: Spidey is straight, wholesome, dull, and ickily adolescent: I'm not sure what Raimis had in mind, but watching scenes where, at the flick of his wrist a infatuated 17 year old shoots sticky white stuff around his bedroom wasn't exactly the superhero experience I  bargained for.Secondly, the ""celebrity Bad Guy having the time of his life"" gambit doesn't pay off: Having a serious thesp play the villain is hardly a new idea. But where Jack Nicholson, Anthony Hopkins, Alan Rickman, Dennis Hopper and so on have animated (and in some cases carried) pretty cheesy films, in Spiderman, Defoe never really gets to grips with his part, and he certainly doesn't ham it up the way it screams out for. Partly I think this is because the green goblin part is poorly conceived: I don't know whether that fault lies with Marvel or Raimis' scriptwriter.And lastly, the special effects aren't that much chop: I rented The Matrix last week, which is practically a senior citizen in the Special FX world, having been around since 1998 or thereabouts. But it still leaves Spiderman for dead.And those are about the only criteria on which a film in the format of Spiderman could have hoped to justify itself. It will never be Citizen Kane, certainly, but given the hype Spiderman received (and its box office receipts) I was a little surprised this picture didn't at least subvert one or two conventions.

585286,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00005JKCH,OverTheMoon,"[5, 6]","The best thing about Spider-Man is the fact that Hollywood has managed to catch Sam Raimi properly and stick him with a better budget. He does have a string of well made movies behind him (Evil Dead, A Simple Plan, Darkman, The Gift) but nothing that says he can handle a Summer Blockbuster movie. However his resume does speak volumes about his trek through the world of superheros and the supernatural and so deservingly and rewardingly they have allowed this man to finally spin a golden celluloid web of mystery, intrigue, action and dark justice.Spider-Man is the first foray for the new ""Marvel"" co-production team. Here they have managed to pick up a fan boy director who is committed to translating a comic book hero onto the screen. Not only that but he is also translating a whole comic book onto the screen. Fans, of both Raimi and Spider-man, should feel very happy with the final result.This film is about the character Peter Parker as much as it is about Spider-Man (Great casting and played to form by Tobey Maguire although I think Jason Patrick would make a good older version of Spider-Man.). Here we see him acquiring his skills, learning his skills and then finally using them. The movie takes almost one hour to get cooking in the Spider-Man vs Bad Guys department, but you do not care because much of what is on display here is a good old fashioned teenage drama about the short-comings of adulthood, love and geekness. Parker, his family, his school friends and his wanna-be-girlfriend are all fully fleshed out. Much of it matches with the reality we live in and it is all played out very realistically and at times with lots of humour. However when Spider-Man turns dark, and it does turn dark, it is very twisted, emotionally challenging and does swing between that fine line of lynch mob revenge and real justice.The premise is simple but complex in the execution. Kid gets bit by radioactive spider, transforms into superhero, meets an anti-superhero (The Goblin) with similar problems who wants revenge for crimes committed against him by the government. Where Spider-Man scores in aces is with the fact that the two Superheros know each other well but do not know each others alter ego. This makes for an emotionally charged ending when all is finally unmasked.Spider-Man does suffer some setbacks. The budget is not quite as high as expected and the special effects can be a little lacklustre at times, however expertly done at other times. The special effects here are hit or miss and at times do look like the CGI we had seen back in the early 1990s.However all of this can be panned aside quickly by the sheer display of action and acting with all... and I mean ALL... that this genre can offer with ample amounts of family values and teenage dilemmas. There is even a final shot of a half-masked Spider-Man where Parker is a reflection of his torn self proving that this character carries lots of psychological fun to boot.This actually has a way more depth that you would expect and to its credit the character department is expertly handled.**As a note the action in the film transcends its PG-13 rating. The action is at times extremely violent and somewhat bloody. In fact the ending is closer to an R rating but because this is fantasy violence in the same vein as Lord of the Rings it gets the PG-13, but maybe pre-viewing by concerned parents should be adopted before showing it to their kids.**",5,"Sam Raimi, Sam Raimi!

I want to talk about the film itself. First let me say I love superhero movies and I did enjoy Spiderman to some degree. BUT!!! There are a few reasons why this film could have been better. Point one - Movies these days don't seem to unravel at a good pace. The narrative seemed rushed, like the film makers were making this for a generation of people who need action all the time or else they'll lose interest. Parker got bitten by the spider and was climbing buildings 5 minutes later. Point two - There is some pretty corny dialogue in this. How did Toby Macguire say some of these lines without bursting into laughter. I refer to the banter between him and Dunst, involving how beautiful he thinks she is and BLAAAHHHH!!! Point three - The Green Goblin guy looked really fake. CGI can either be good or really bad. In this case it stank. The hollywood film industry is becoming like fast food. Quick, processed and leaves you feeling a bit empty. But I'm gonna leave this review on a good note.

The visual effects were really dreadful, comparable to a cheap video game--I can't understand why so many people were impressed by them. Spider-Man moves like a puppet, the Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger...they should have tried to do a little bit less with CGI figures, and shot more of the action with acrobats. Also, I can't understand why they put that raised plastic ribbing on Spider-Man's costume; it looks awful and it is unfathomable how a broke teenager could manufacture such a thing. Killing the Green Goblin was a bad dramatic choice--in the original comic book series Norman Osborn remained alive for years, alternating between amnesia and psychosis. This put Peter Parker in a state of perpetual anxiety and moral conflict and created great suspense in the storyline; one never knew when Osborn would slip into his mania again.In spite of these problems, I liked the melodramatic aspects of the film a lot.

Such noble and pure feelings of a introverted boy for a girl next door, old fashioned but in such a manner that proves that a love theme is always powerful and above every action packed sequence.The Green Goblin character demanded more attention since such a modern Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde theme is essential to the dramatization of the story.The soundtrack was exceptionally subtle and did not go for the easy musical trademark setting of the superhero. Well played out and well put through out the movie.The story of Spider-Man is a modern tragedy. The character is going through a roller coaster of emotional changes due to unpredictable life turning events. Not your average superhero story. The director along with the writing team must have consciously aimed to that effect.The tragedy though does not give away to an ending, because sequels need to be made, all of them welcome if properly done. The ending provides the base of Peter Parker's tragedy. The girl that he loved since he was six year old must finally be deprived of his true feelings for her. How come though? Simply, because he cherishes her life much more than his love gratification, he understands that Spider-Man can not allow any future Nemesis to hurt the people in his heart.

Thank you for your understanding.We've all seen how heroes like Batman and Superman came about.  Peter Parker's story is a bit different, mainly because he doesn't have a seemingly unlimited bank account, the best martial arts training in the world, or an alien origin to work with.  He's simply a random kid who was randomly bitten by a genetically-engineered superspider (How come that spider didn't bite anyone else by the way?) and ultimately made the best of the situation by becoming a superhero.  With that being the tale, it's a pretty good tale as told in this film.  Toby McGuire plays the role quite well and even makes the more sappy and cliche moments sound pretty good.  His love interest, Mary Jane, played by Kirsten Dunst, is someone I could have done without...she was just so bland that any random girl could have been hanging off that bridge at the end and I would have had the same reaction.  Apart from Spider-Man himself, my two favorite characters (they're tied for this honor) are Uncle Ben and J. Jonah Jameson.  Cliff Robertson wasn't in the film for very long, but his performance was so powerful that you couldn't help but feel sad when Uncle Ben died, making him a beloved and influencial character, which is what the filmmakers were surely going for.  Well filmmakers, a job well done.  As for J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, I could never get enough of that guy.  He may be funny and perhaps a bit over-the-top, but it all only contributes to this character and makes him unique among the newspaper editors that so many superheroes seem to have in their lives.  Plus, J. K. Simmons is just a great actor and always worth watching.  And finally, the thing most debut superhero films do, the one and only villain.  Willem Dafoe played a power-hungry Norman Osborn and a completely creepy Green Goblin...a combination that ought to land this character in Arkham Asylum.  Like Toby McGuire, he makes the sappy and cliche moments work for this film and its tone.  James Franco, playing Harry Osborn, was a bit more complex and this set him up perfectly for the coming sequels.  This film portrayed a superhero's origin as well as any before it and stepped up a notch, making any audience truely care about where this web-slinging kid came from and where he's going.

The film explores the origins of the transformation of Peter Parker from nerdy high school student to the web slinging superhero Spider-Man.  Tobey Maguire is quite good in the title role.  He plays the character with the right amount of torment as an outcast who has been put down all his life, but injects pride, joy and happiness into the Peter from his newly bestowed powers.  Kirtsen Dunst is Peter's next door neighbor, Mary Jane Watson.  Ms. Dunst is not given much to work worth in the character, she is the requisite love interest, damsel in distress but she is appealing in the role.  Willem Dafoe is plays the Green Goblin who is the villain in the film.  The Goblin's alter ego is Norman Osborne who is the rich father of Harry (James Franco), Peter's best friend and roommate.  Mr. Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Goblin and he handles the character's schizophrenic outbursts with creepy aplomb.  Mr. Franco plays Harry sullenly and he appears as if he is moping through the picture.  J.K. Simmons plays Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson as a pushy, demanding blowhard who listens only to himself with hilarious results.  People have criticized the fighting and action scenes, but they are really no better or worse than most current action films.  There are some Matrix like sequences with the slow motion, but these scenes actually help show Spider-Man's spider senses that allow him to anticipate and react quickly to danger.

When I was a young kid, I was a huge Spider-Man fan with the action figures and comic books. As time went on and as I grew older I forgot about him, but that changed when I saw the previews for this movie. I finally saw the movie tonight and it brought back those care free days I had as a kid. Seeing Spider-Man was just one of the most amazing movie experiences (along with E.T.) ever. I have to say this movie was AWESOME. This movie truly has a great stand out cast. TOBEY MAGUIRE who plays Spider-Man did an amazing job. He brought emotion to the character that made him more human than any other hero in a comic book inspired movie. Another great performance was by KIRSTEN DUNST who brought the Lois Lane like quality to this movie, and gave one of her best movie performances to date. Together the two just ignited the big screen and as the sparks flew it gave the movie a romantic twist. The action scenes are amazing and they make you jump out of your seat a few times. All that along with the emotional journey that Spider-Man takes you on, thats what truly makes this movie so great and special. This is one Roller-Coaster ride i highly encourage any one to see. The ending is also a surprise and I will not give it away, but I will say some people liked it and some people did not, Go figure. I did not buy in to all the Hype of this movie. I went to see it cause I wanted to. SPIDER-MAN is breaking Box Office Records! Spider-Man was the #1 Movie at the box Office for the weekend of May 4-5 and had the largest opening gross ever its first week with $118 million. It broke another record in its second week of release on May 11-12 with grossing $72 million, which is the most any movie has ever grossed on its second week, and if thats not enough it is the fastest movie to pass the $200 million mark in only 9 days. I can see why because this movie is just AWESOME! I will be waiting in line when SPIDER-MAN comes out on DVD! Check Spider-Man out!

585307,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,B00005JKCH,Priscilla Stafford,"[14, 17]","I actually got to see Spider-Man on May 3rd! In Japan it is highly unusual for a movie to come out on the same date as in America, there's unusually at least a 3 month wait. But surprisingly, I was able to see ""Spider-Man"" on May 3rd by getting reserved tickets! And I must say, the movie was so much better than I expected (and I had expected a lot!)High school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is while very smart is the school freak. His only friend is Harry Osborne (James Franco), son of scientist Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe). He is also very much in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) though he won't approach her. So he goes through life ignored and made fun of. But Peter's life is about to be turned upside down when at a high school excursion to the museum he is bitten by a genetically enhanced super spider. At first thinking none of it, he goes back home where he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). But the next day, he wakes up to find himself with perfect vision and also a more muscular body! Stranger things happen in school where he finally realizes that the bite he got has given him special abilities which spiders have, from amazing agility, strength, extraordinary senses, and web flinging powers. He soon finds out though that with his new powers comes great responsibility. Norman Osborne has got a split personality, the other side of him being the evil Green Goblin. Peter knows that someone has to stop him... could that someone be 'Spider-Man'?I must say that ""Spider-Man"" has got it all! *ACTING*: Kirsten Dunst is very believable as the not-so-perfect Mary Jane with her family and love problems. You can't help but feel for her character. Then there's Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne/Green Goblin. His scene where he confronts 'himself' in the mirror was remarkably well down, it takes an enormous amount of talent to be able to portray two different personalities like that. And I mustn't forget Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. He can show his expressions so well, from his shy smile to Mary Jane, his turmoil of grief, his determination to stop Green Goblin, and his excitement when he first tries out his superpowers. You can't help but become attached to his character. Though I have never read any of the Spider-Man comics, my father has and he was so delighted to find that the editor of the newspaper seemed to be right out of the comic book, from his looks to his attitude.*PLOT*: Intriguing plot, making the two hours of the movie seem to flick by so fast. The story has plenty of surprises and twists, making the whole entire time very enjoyable. The first thirty minutes or so was very light, I was laughing a lot on the mishaps of Peter Parker's previous life to becoming Spider-Man. But from then on it became a little bit more serious, the ending climaxing to explosion of action and excitement! The end might put off some people but I found it highly satisfying. I can't tell what happens but I must say that the end definitely calls for a sequel! As for the humor and seriousness of the film, I always believe that most all movies should have the right balance of these two points. And Spider-Man was great, having plenty of humor to keep my laughing yet a serious tone to it which was essential to the movie.*ACTION AND F/X*: The action is so well done that through the last hour or so of the movie I was on the edge of my seat! All of the confrontations of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were very exciting, the last 'battle' (as there usual is) the most tense. As in the trailers, Spider-Man does not only get to fly and fling himself through the air, he also gets to do a lot of hand-to-hand fighting and kung-fu. Applause to the fight coordinator. The F/X were pretty real yet had a sort of comic book feel to it making it very easy to watch and enjoy. Watch Spider-Man fly through the air, send out webs, twist in the air in what seems like impossible moves, and fight evil with the agility of... well you know, a spider!*PG-13 RATING*: The film is rated PG-13 for 'stylized action and violence' but I think think there should be added 'and for some language'.So my conclusion is, ""Spider-Man"" is a GREAT film and I most definitely will be getting the DVD as soon as it comes out! Maybe see it in the theaters a few more times :-). I also recommend two other super-hero movies which are my favorites, ""Superman"" with Christopher Reeve and ""The Shadow"" with Alec Baldwin. ""Batman"" was also interesting though it didn't make much of an impression on me.",5,"Spider-man, a movie with an intricate web of fun!",1020384000,"05 3, 2002",2002,4568,"['actually', 'got', 'see', 'Spider-Man', 'May', '3rd', 'Japan', 'highly', 'unusual', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'same', 'date', 'America', 'unusually', 'least', '3', 'month', 'wait', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'Spider-Man', 'May', '3rd', 'getting', 'reserved', 'tickets', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'had', 'expected', 'lot', 'High', 'school', 'student', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'while', 'very', 'smart', 'school', 'freak', 'only', 'friend', 'Harry', 'Osborne', 'James', 'Franco', 'son', 'scientist', 'Norman', 'Osborne', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'wo', ""n't"", 'approach', 'life', 'ignored', 'made', 'fun', 'Peter', 'life', 'be', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'high', 'school', 'excursion', 'museum', 'bitten', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'super', 'spider', 'first', 'thinking', 'none', 'back', 'home', 'where', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'next', 'day', 'up', 'find', 'perfect', 'vision', 'also', 'more', 'muscular', 'body', 'Stranger', 'things', 'happen', 'school', 'where', 'finally', 'bite', 'got', 'given', 'special', 'abilities', 'spiders', 'have', 'amazing', 'agility', 'strength', 'extraordinary', 'senses', 'web', 'flinging', 'powers', 'soon', 'out', 'new', 'powers', 'great', 'responsibility', 'Norman', 'Osborne', 'got', 'split', 'personality', 'other', 'side', 'being', 'evil', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Peter', 'someone', 'stop', 'could', 'someone', 'be', ""'Spider-Man"", 'must', 'say', 'Spider-Man', 'got', '*ACTING*', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'very', 'believable', 'not-so-perfect', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'family', 'love', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'character', 'Then', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Norman', 'Osborne/Green', 'Goblin', 'scene', 'where', 'mirror', 'was', 'remarkably', 'well', 'down', 'enormous', 'amount', 'talent', 'be', 'able', 'portray', 'two', 'different', 'personalities', 'must', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Spider-Man/Peter', 'Parker', 'can', 'show', 'expressions', 'so', 'well', 'shy', 'smile', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'turmoil', 'grief', 'determination', 'stop', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'excitement', 'when', 'first', 'out', 'superpowers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'become', 'attached', 'character', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Spider-Man', 'comics', 'father', 'was', 'so', 'delighted', 'find', 'editor', 'newspaper', 'seemed', 'be', 'right', 'comic', 'book', 'looks', 'attitude', '*PLOT*', 'Intriguing', 'plot', 'making', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'seem', 'flick', 'so', 'fast', 'story', 'plenty', 'surprises', 'twists', 'making', 'whole', 'entire', 'time', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'so', 'was', 'very', 'light', 'was', 'laughing', 'lot', 'mishaps', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'previous', 'life', 'becoming', 'Spider-Man', 'then', 'became', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'serious', 'ending', 'climaxing', 'explosion', 'action', 'excitement', 'end', 'might', 'put', 'off', 'people', 'found', 'highly', 'satisfying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'must', 'say', 'end', 'definitely', 'sequel', 'humor', 'seriousness', 'film', 'always', 'believe', 'most', 'movies', 'should', 'have', 'right', 'balance', 'two', 'points', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'great', 'having', 'plenty', 'humor', 'keep', 'laughing', 'yet', 'serious', 'tone', 'was', 'essential', 'movie', '*ACTION', 'F/X*', 'action', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'last', 'hour', 'so', 'movie', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'confrontations', 'Spider-Man', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'were', 'very', 'exciting', 'last', ""'battle"", 'there', 'usual', 'most', 'tense', 'trailers', 'Spider-Man', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'fly', 'fling', 'air', 'also', 'do', 'lot', 'hand-to-hand', 'fighting', 'kung-fu', 'Applause', 'fight', 'coordinator', 'F/X', 'were', 'pretty', 'real', 'yet', 'had', 'sort', 'comic', 'book', 'feel', 'making', 'very', 'easy', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'Watch', 'Spider-Man', 'fly', 'air', 'send', 'out', 'webs', 'twist', 'air', 'what', 'impossible', 'moves', 'fight', 'evil', 'agility', 'well', 'know', 'spider', '*PG-13', 'RATING*', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', ""'stylized"", 'action', 'violence', 'think', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'added', ""'and"", ""language'.So"", 'conclusion', 'Spider-Man', 'GREAT', 'film', 'most', 'definitely', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'DVD', 'as', 'soon', 'out', 'Maybe', 'see', 'theaters', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'also', 'recommend', 'two', 'other', 'super-hero', 'movies', 'are', 'favorites', 'Superman', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Shadow', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Batman', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'impression']",N/A

However, there are so many that one could assume that the same individual did them both.Both feature a hero that becomes an obsessed vigilante against crime upon the death of a loved one. Both have a character that is eons removed from his mild-mannered ""alter ego"". The two films feature over-the-top performances from the ""villain"" (Nicholson as Batman's ""Joker"" and Dafoe as ""The Green Goblin""). Both have an elderly ""sage"" in the form of ""Alfred"" and ""Uncle Ben"", respectively. A mammoth citywide celebration with music provided by contemporary stars is one of the commonalities in both (""Batman"" had Prince and ""Spiderman"" has Macy Gray). The pair features state-of-the-art special effects and a very similar score penned by Danny Elfman.But the main ""bond"" between the movies is in the casting of the least likely of performers in the title roles. Much was said about Michael Keaton's selection as the Dark Knight. But, he pulled it off superbly.Thus, Tobey Maguire, surprisingly buffed and confident, dons the tights nicely and believably as ""the web spinner"".

After all, who doesn't want to fly? But Spider-man takes a more down to earth hero from the comics successfully unto the big screen. Sam Raimi did a great job in bringing out the character as he's supposed to be unlike those tragedic Batman movies. They did take some liberties in Spiderman's origin and powers but it was still told quite nicely and, in some cases, like his organic webbing was a better change. I didn't think I would have liked this movie after having seen X-men. X-men was an ok movie but the mutant thing has been done to death. Didn't like their costume change either. Now, Spiderman shows that if you just portray the character seriously enough, you can still use those colorful comic costumes on screen and still be believable.I think Tobey McGuire did an excellent job as Peter Parker. You really felt his anger at his Uncle's untimely demise. You really felt like swinging with him as he learned on the fly how to websling from rooftop to rooftop. And Kirsten Dunst, another character who I didn't think I'd believe in, portrayed a great Mary Jane Watson. Didn't even think her red hair annoyed me in the entire movie unlike Storm's godawful fake hair in X-men.The dvd widerscreen is definitely the way to go. The black bars on the top and bottom aren't as big as other widescreen movies so you still have great picture even at a 27"" TV. Lots of extras on the two disc set. Great animated menus although the interface is kinda weird with their shortcuts selection method. Takes awhile to figure out what does what. The movie itself is a great transfer.

585319,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JKCH,Reviewer,"[2, 2]","It may be a story lifted from the pages of a comic book, but with some strong performances, a focused story and some great F/X, director Sam Raimi puts blood in the veins of one of the best superheroes ever to hit the big screen.  And let's face it, right now the world needs just such a character; someone who can right wrongs, stave off injustice, assuage fears and give people a sense of security in a world seemingly gone amuck at times, and thanks to the magic of the movies we have him now.  His name is ""Spider-Man.""Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a normal, if not typical teenager; mature beyond his years, he would rather attend a science fair than go to a rave, he lives with his aunt and uncle (Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson) and has been in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl who lives next door, since about the first grade.  ""MJ,"" however, doesn't even know he exists; except for an occasional ""hello,"" they barely know one another.  But though Peter doesn't know it, all of that-- Peter's life-- is about to undergo a radical change.On a field trip to a science lab, Peter is bitten by a spider-- not just any spider, but one that's been genetically altered.  And when he wakes up the next morning, he finds himself changed; it's not exactly Kafka's Metamorphosis, but he does have new life and new energy, and beginning with his vision (he suddenly can see clearly without his glasses), he gradually discovers that he has certain physical abilities that do not necessarily coincide with the kind of changes consistent with a young man of his age.  Like being able to spin webs from his wrists and climb up the side of buildings.  And now all he has to do is learn how to control and use his newly found prowess, and decide what to do with it all.  Which he does very quickly, when circumstances provide him with a motive and a personal agenda that leads him to become, as Peter himself puts it, ""Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.""With this film, Raimi takes a page out of the Tim Burton Book and gives us a character that is convincing and real, because he shows us the man first, and then the superhero.  Like Burton did in the original ""Batman,"" in which Michael Keaton played to the man, rather than to the ""bat,"" Raimi takes Maguire down the same path, having him play to Peter, rather than the ""spider.""  And it makes all the difference in the world.  Instead of merely thrusting a full-blown superhero onto the screen, Raimi first develops a plausible storyline (screenplay by David Koepp) complete with a central character to whom the audience can relate, and once that is established it enables the audience to suspend disbelief and go with the flow when Peter emerges as Spider-Man.  The F/X are incredible, and Raimi uses the stunning visual aspect of the film to great effect, but it would all be for naught without the solid core of believable characters he puts into place and then uses as a foundation upon which to build the spectacular.  It's reality based, but imaginatively presented-- Raimi definitely knows what works and how to entertain and involve his audience, which he certainly does here.  And this is arguably Raimi's best work yet.When it was announced that Tobey Maguire had landed the role of Spider-Man, you could almost hear the collective audible gasp of fans everywhere.  Tobey Maguire?  Spider-Man?  !!!  But-- as it turns out-- it was inspired casting, as Maguire is perfect as everybody's favorite web-slinger.  In fact, hopefully he's been signed to a multi-picture deal, because now it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.  Without question, Maguire IS Spider-Man.  His appearance, the way he carries himself-- his entire countenance-- combined with his attitude and the subtle way he expresses himself, are all part and parcel of what brings Peter Parker and Spider-Man to life.  Maguire, as he has demonstrated previously in such films as ""The Ice Storm"" and ""The Cider House Rules,"" has a naturally pleasing and accessible personality that serves him so well in the characters he creates, and none more so than with his portrayal of Peter.  He has the talent and ability to aptly convey that ""ordinary person under extraordinary circumstances"" scenario and make it believable, which is exactly what was needed to make this film successful; and Maguire nails it with a performance that is introspective and affecting, and it makes the character-- as well as the film-- work.Willem Dafoe also contributes to the film's appeal with his portrayal of Norman Osborn, aka, the ""Green Goblin.""  Not since the Joker sparred with Batman has the screen had such a memorable villain; and again, Dafoe first plays to the man-- to Osborn-- and then to the ""Goblin,"" which puts a real face on Evil and gives the character the depth that makes him more than just superficially ""bad.""  Defoe goes that extra mile to make a Osborn real, and deserves credit for giving him real substance, rather than being satisfied with a one dimensional character that has nothing going on beneath the surface.  The Goblin is a complex character, and Dafoe plays him perfectly.Kirsten Dunst had something of a challenge with her role of Mary Jane, as the character is somewhat ambiguous; on one hand, she plays a pivotal role in motivating Spider-Man, while her own part in the grand scheme of things remains uncertain until the end.  And only then are we given a glimpse of the direction in which MJ may go, and it will be interesting to see how the character develops in the next installment, now that the groundwork has been ably laid by Dunst.  In the final analysis, ""Spider-Man"" is a winner that is going to attract a huge following; this is one film that definitely has legs.",5,Maguire Brings Spider-Man to Life,1020556800,"05 5,

Put simply, it is a cut-down version of a Pop-Culture Legend, dumbed severely down for the benefit of the moviegoing masses.Taking the lead as peter Parker is Toby Maguire, an actor, whose career, if this original is anything to judge the impending two sequels by, has taken a severe turn in the direction of 'Typecast'. As Peter Parker he is suitably weedy and nervy, but as Spiderman lacks any of the believability or sense of Cool that has made the character a comic Titan. He is grating, immature and whiney. The truly abysmal quality of the 'special' effects does not help this. Spider-Man in action is mostly a computer animation, and is noticably poorly-realised. Put simply, the character does not come across in the least way believable.Runnung a close second to Maguire in terms of pointlessness is Willem DaFoe in the role of the Green Goblin. Both as Norman Osborne and the Goblin himself, DaFoe's total lack of sympathy and understanding for his role leaves us with a villain as unconvincing as his costume - which, in this day and age of astounding creative design, is unacceptably boring.Kirsten Dunst is relatively good as the winsome Mary Jane Watson, ditto Rosemary Harris as Aunt May.Direction is run-of-the-mill fare for this sort of blockbuster, but thanks to truly lousy special effects and a huge sense of the pedestrian impregnating the whole picture, the visual impact made by 'Spider-Man' is not enormous. A real missed opportunity for director Sam Raimi.Boring script (nothing unexpected, very little character development), boring visuals and uninspired performances team with lousy characterisation to make 'Spider-Man' a huge waste of glorious potential and excellent source material, and a total exercise in mundanity.Avoid!",1,Preposterous Drivel,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,2110,"['was', 'suppose', 'inevitable', ""'Spider-Man"", 'one', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'best-established', 'longest-running', 'comic', 'books', 'would', 'eventually', 'be', 'given', 'Magic', 'Movies', 'X-Men', 'Batman', 'Superman', ""'Spider-Man"", 'loud', 'adrenilane-fuelled', 'romp', 'sixty', 'years', 'characterisation', 'carefully', 'developed', 'characters', 'Put', 'simply', 'cut-down', 'version', 'Pop-Culture', 'Legend', 'dumbed', 'severely', 'down', 'benefit', 'moviegoing', 'masses.Taking', 'lead', 'peter', 'Parker', 'Toby', 'Maguire', 'actor', 'career', 'original', 'anything', 'judge', 'impending', 'two', 'sequels', 'taken', 'severe', 'turn', 'direction', ""'Typecast"", 'Peter', 'Parker', 'suitably', 'weedy', 'nervy', 'Spiderman', 'believability', 'sense', 'Cool', 'made', 'character', 'comic', 'Titan', 'grating', 'immature', 'whiney', 'truly', 'abysmal', 'quality', ""'special"", 'effects', 'not', 'help', 'Spider-Man', 'action', 'mostly', 'computer', 'animation', 'noticably', 'poorly-realised', 'Put', 'simply', 'character', 'not', 'come', 'least', 'way', 'close', 'second', 'Maguire', 'terms', 'pointlessness', 'Willem', 'DaFoe', 'role', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Norman', 'Osborne', 'Goblin', 'DaFoe', 'total', 'lack', 'sympathy', 'understanding', 'role', 'villain', 'as', 'unconvincing', 'costume', 'day', 'age', 'astounding', 'creative', 'design', 'unacceptably', 'boring.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'relatively', 'good', 'winsome', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'ditto', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Aunt', 'May.Direction', 'run-of-the-mill', 'fare', 'sort', 'blockbuster', 'thanks', 'truly', 'lousy', 'special', 'effects', 'huge', 'sense', 'pedestrian', 'impregnating', 'whole', 'picture', 'visual', 'impact', 'made', ""'Spider-Man"", 'not', 'enormous', 'real', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi.Boring', 'script', 'nothing', 'unexpected', 'very', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'boring', 'visuals', 'uninspired', 'performances', 'team', 'lousy', 'characterisation', 'make', ""'Spider-Man"", 'huge', 'waste', 'glorious', 'potential', 'excellent', 'source', 'material', 'total', 'exercise', 'mundanity.Avoid']",N/A

After being bitten by a genetically enhanced ""super-spider"", the life of social outcast Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets an unsuspected turn as the wall-crawling, web-slinging hero Spider-Man. Now, New York's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man will face the wrath of the maniacal Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and win the admiration of sweetheart Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). ""Spider-Man"" is a sensational box-office spectacle that combines rousing comic-book adventure and strong human drama. Director Sam Raimi has captured the spirit and heart of the comic that surely satisfy audiences and fans of the genre. The action scenes are straight out of the comic-book and the special effects are good but not quite ""amazing"". Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast for the role of Peter Parker and Willem Dafoe delivers a devilish performance as the Green Goblin. Fans of Sam Raimi's work will notice Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi in small roles and expect a small cameo by Lucy Lawless (Xena).Columbia definitely scores high marks for their latest DVD release.

585325,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B00005JKCH,RJ Smoove,"[2, 2]","Following the cult classic status of Blade and the surprising box office success of X-Men, Marvel decided to lend out the rights of another one of their most cherished characters. Based on the success of the cartoons, this was sure to pull in a very specific demographic, but I doubt they expected it to be as popular as it became. It surpassed the success of X-Men, and ushered in a decade that would have many more comic book, cartoon, and toy movies set records. For too many years, these types of properties did not get the respect they deserved as real dramatic and action movies, and not just dumb superhero fun. Spider-Man finally got that due respect. The weekend it came out, my focus was on Star Wars Episode II, but after I saw Spider-Man I was blown away. Like many others of my generation, my fandome really started with the first Spidey film, and then blossomed into collecting stacks upon stacks of comics. The visual effects were not the standard for the time, especially with the aforementioned Star Wars film coming out, but they were still pretty damn good. The music was fantastic, thanks to Danny Elfman (the man behind The Simpsons music, and so many other great film scores). Director Sam Raimi created a truly stylistic and visual masterpiece. Honestly, I'm not a fan of the Evil Dead series. I doubted a director best known for horror movies would do the material justice, but he did not disappoint.Neither did the cast. All of the actors were fairly new to me. I had no idea who most of them were, except Kirsten Dunst I knew from Small Soldiers (I was a child). But I always applaud and appreciate big blockbusters that turn lesser names into household names. Tobey maguire and Dunst had a chemistry that really dold the complex relationship of the two iconic characters they were portraying. To this day, my favorite character, besides Spider-Man, is definitely JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. If ever there were an actor born to play a specific supporting role, it was him. Willem Dafoe was great as Norman Osborn. As the serum changed him from a desperate businessman to a conflicted monster, the not so subtle nuances of Dafoe's performance really began to shine through. If only Green Goblin's costume had less of a silly looking design, then his character would be one of the premier villains in Marvel film history. As it stands, Goblin's costume only hurts the film by making it seem more campy than it really is. It serves as a constant reminder that you're watching a cartoon with real people acting it out. Nevertheless, Spider-Man should definitely be creditted as the film that sparked the hype and interest that comic book adaptations get today. If it were not for Spider-Man (as well as Blade and X-Men), I doubt that movies like Watchmen, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Fantastic 4, Ghost Rider, Punisher, Dare Devil, or any of the other countless comic book and superhero flicks would have been taken seriously enough to be converted from script into film.And the Blu-ray presentation of this old favorite of mine was night and day upon my discovery of the disc. I had seen the DVDs countless times, but it wasn't until my eyes were laid upon the BD that I appreciated every inch of every frame as they were shot. Detail is remarkable. Color is rich. It truly is like watching the movie for the very first time. Now this re-release features extras that the first release lacked. It has pretty much all the essentials, and leaves behind some of the more fluff extras from the DVDs.

585327,A1T3CTSM0B3IZA,B00005JKCH,Robb Boutros,"[0, 0]","This movie has been in the making for the better part of 20 years. Through all the trials, tribulations, bankruptcys and legal wranglings, director Sam Raimi has delivered the goods. And he's done so in a BIG way!!Having read Spider-Man when I was younger I had high expectations for this film. My expectations were not only met, but they were exceeded. Spider-Man is now, and I say without hyperbole, the benchmark that all other comic book movies will be measured against.Tobey Maguire, plays Peter Parker. Our reluctant, shy and unassuming hero. What sets him apart is that he doesn't fit the super hero mold. He's awkward, and a bit on the nerdy side. But all that's about to change. On a class field trip to Columbia University he is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider. He then undergoes a remarkable ""metamorphesis"". He takes on a spider's strength, speed, agility, and even a sixth ""spider sense"". From there on his world is turned upside down.What makes Spider-Man work is that, at it's core, it's not about super powers or villains or costumes. It's about a person. A person who makes decisions and has to deal with the reprecussions of his actions. A person who is also at times uncomfortable with being a hero. That's what sets him apart from the rest of his super hero bretheren. The human element is what really sets the film apart from many of the other comic book movies. As in Superman you feel somewhat removed from the character, you really feel for Peter Parker and his predicament.For Parker, the choices are not always as simple as black and white.Kirsten Dunst is absolutley radiant as Mary Jane Watson. Peter who has secretly been in love with Mary Jane since he was a child. There is a certain sweetness to the underlying love story that is genuine. Peter is, afterall, just a shy, awkward young man. But it's those underdog qualities that endear you to him.Wilem Defoe turns in a riveting performance as one of Spideys oldest foes, the Green Goblin. The armor may look a little hokey but it's Defoe's mannerisms that really make this an inspired choice for him.The CGI effects really make you believe he can do whatever a spider can. A few years ago this film would have had a completely different look. All the legal troubles were in fact, a mixed blessing. Fortunately, technology advanced enough to the point where the CGI really allowed the web head to swing effortlessly between sky scrapers with the greatest of ease.This is one hero for the ages. See this movie. I can go on all day about this film. To him life is a great big bang up, wherever there's a hangup you'll find the Spider-Man!!",5,Who am I?

585328,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,B00005JKCH,Robert J. Schneider,"[13, 16]","For those of us who have been waiting literally years for this, one of the greatest comic book series ever, to come to larger-than-life enormity on the big screen, this film is a godsend. One of the very few 'event movies' to actually live up to its hype, SPIDER-MAN (2002), as brilliantly directed by the wonderful Sam Raimi (one of the most successful cult directors in film history), delivers BIG-TIME!! It is perfectly cast, from Tobey Maguire in the title role--probably the role he was born to play--to Willem Dafoe, as his dreaded arch-enemy, to the beautiful Kirsten Dunst, the girl he would love to ask out on a date.Actually, I knew that Tobey Maguire would be perfect as the nerdy, super-shy Peter Parker, who of course turns into Spider-man after being bitten by a genetically altered, and very colorful, red-and-blue spider in a science lab. I've seen Maguire in both PLEASANTVILLE (1997) and THE CIDER HOUSE RULES (1999) and I just knew that he fit Peter Parker to a T. Also perfectly cast is Willem Dafoe, as well-meaning corporate head Norman Osborne, who of course gives in to his evil side to become the fearsome Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst, as sweet-but-troubled Mary Jane Watson, finds just the right note in her performance; her M.J. is pretty but not overly glamorous, talented but underachieving, desirable but not inaccessible. I've been following Dunst's career ever since seeing her remarkable debut, INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (1994), for which she should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and I can say that she is every bit as deserving as Tobey Maguire for starring in such a wonderful film, which by the way just smashed all box-office opening-week records ($115 million). Now both actors are finally getting their due recognition!Also finally getting his due recognition is director Sam Raimi, who first made the splatter-fest THE EVIL DEAD (1983), and the even better (and funnier) EVIL DEAD 2 (1987), before going on to direct the wonderful DARKMAN (1990) and then finishing the EVIL DEAD trilogy with ARMY OF DARKNESS (1993). More known to a wide TV audience as the exec producer of the ""Hercules"" and ""Xena"" series, Sam Raimi is now making his triumphant return to feature films. And what a triumph this film is!SPIDER-MAN has action, fun, brains, brawn, suspense, and most importantly, a great storyline which blends the traditional comic-book story with modern-day realism. Sam Raimi and the screenwriter found a way to not alienate the original fans, while incorporating today's hip humor and attitudes. Plus, it was filmed in my original hometown of New York City! :)To sum up: Great cast, great acting, great action, great story, great direction, great visuals, filmed in NYC. I can't wait to see it again, and I can't wait to own it on DVD! Now, the questions that may be on your mind if you haven't yet seen it: Does Spider-man conquer evil? Is he conquered instead?? Does he get the girl??? The answers to these questions are not so obvious; you have to go out and see it, and find out for yourself!!!!

But after this, I don't think I would picture anyone else as Peter Parker.  He really brings the character to life, embodying many of the deep qualities we love and admire from the comics and the cartoon, but in a majorly human way.

That brings the world-wide gross to about a billion bucks.  An off the chart figure.  So what is it about this story that connected with a global audience on such a stratospheric level?  Was it the marketing, the name recognition from the seemingly endless series of comic book incarnations or something else?If the film does not hold up as well as one might guess on repeated viewings, the metaphors for the frustrations and fantasies of male puberty come though even clearer.  Perhaps more than anything, this film is a romantic rite of passage; almost tribal in its subtext (the ritual spider bite and the shamanistic hallucinations of flying and fighting demons) but in a post-modern garb.But does it all add up to anything?  Not really.  Perfectly directed by super-visualist Sam Raimi (a master of the floating camera), and with nice, understated, naturalistic performances by Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst.  These two actors exude a rare and apparently authentic chemistry in their scenes together.  Inexplicably, Maguire is missing on the entertaining audio commentary with Raimi and Dunst.

585332,AM4ZQJ0IORVWG,B00005JKCH,"Rob ""Revuman""","[0, 0]","The Basic Plot: Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire), the school whipping post, gets bitten by a genetically altered super spider.  Almost overnight, he gains wild spider-like powers.  While at first he uses them to attempt to get into Mary Jane's proverbial pants (played by Kirsten Dunst) he realizes that he should use his new found powers to put a stopper in local crime after his uncle and parental guardian is killed by a car-jacker, a crime which he himself could have stopped.  At the same time, a strange creature named the Green Goblin has begun terrorizing the city.  Who is this ""Green Goblin"" character, and will Spiderman be able to stop him?The Movie:  It has a very comic book feel at times, which is a good thing.  The acting moves back and forth from very good to rather hokey.  The best acting comes from Willem Dafoe, whose scenes as the split personality Dr. Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin stand out as some of the best in the movie.  Kirsten Dunst, while great to look at, is nothing special as Mary Jane in Spiderman.  Even in the very emotional scenes I don't buy it.  And Toby, perfectly cast as Parker, and although some say he isn't the one they would have pegged as Spiderman, he's a perfect Peter Parker, and since Spidy and Parker are one and the same, it would only make sense.  As for Direction and Cinematography, don't expect anything really new here.  It's your clear-cut action movie with the classic Raimi touches like his brother being in the movie, the Cadillac makes a return appearance, and Bruce Campbell makes a cameo as the Ring Announcer.  All in all it's not a bad lil' flick.The Video:  Talk about a great transfer.  Although I only buy Widescreen for the most part, this DVD comes in either the widescreen or fullscreen version.  I would have to push for the Widescreen, especially if you got the home theater for it, or if you're just a purist movie buff like me!The Audio:  This is where 5.1 audio is key.  Every little sound byte comes through crystal clear from the metallic whooshes during the spidy sense scene to the big explosions during the Oscorp Gala scene in Midtown.  Yay to Columbia Tri-Star and the Spiderman Team for this audio!The Disc one Commentary:  For the love of GOD, do not put Kirsten Dunst on a commentary with Sam Raimi.  Shoot me in the foot, put a skirt on my head, and call me Sally Struthers before you put anyone with ears in front of a set of speakers and force me to listen to that girl talk.  It's ok when you have a good script behind her, but I'll tell you, in 2 hours, every time I heard her say something, I couldn't help but feel dumber.  As for the rest of the people on the Commentary, including Raimi and producers Laura Ziskin and Grant Curtis, they all said stuff that was interesting and worth listening to (in reference to the visuals of the movie).  But please, know whom you are putting on a commentary Columbia Pictures.  Some actors aren't meant to do improv!The Extras:  First off, unless you actually care about Sum 41, you're not going to care much for their music video.  So exnay on that.  As for the other extras, there is no original behind the scenes from the cast and crew of Spiderman.  The only thing you do get is the HBO and E! behind the scenes, which are ok, but half of it is all about stuff that you probably could have figured out from picking up a copy of ""The Amazing Spiderman"", doesn't matter which.  The screen tests of Toby and J.K. Simmons, while at first glance sound great, aren't very long or really all that worthwhile.  There are some ok DVD-ROM features, but unless you have a DVD-ROM in your computer, it doesn't really matter because you can't access them.  The outtake reel is sub par.  I'll say it again, IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE AN OUTTAKE REEL, REALLY DO IT!  However, there is a lot of interesting background info on the Spiderman Comic book and it's leap from comic to screen.The Bad:  If there is one thing that killed the extras disk, it's the horrible layout of the menus.  Very hard to navigate and easy for you to miss parts of the extras that you might have overlooked.  When I buy a DVD, the extras are key, and they have to be laid out so that someone can access them.  Now, if I can build a computer, but have a hard time accessing the extras on a DVD, something is wrong.  Oh, and Kirsten Dunst in the Commentary (I can't mention this enough!)The Final Word:  Buy the DVD for the movie, stay for some of the extras and come back to it every now and then when you need to watch a straightforward action movie.

The reason is that &quot;Superman&quot; took itself pretty seriously.  This film doesn't.  It is, quite simply, the comic book come to life.As far as I know I read every Spider-Man comic book from its inception until 1968, when I discovered girls.  So I speak here with authority.  This film **is** the comic book.  If you liked the comic book, you'll like the film.  If not, you probably won't.I watched the DVD expecting to hate it.  Within 10 minutes I was hooked.  OK, fine, so the special effects don't look 100% authentic (they're great, just not believable).  OK, so the Green Goblin is a little hard to believe.  So what?  Like they were authentic and realistic in the comic book?  Give me a break.  This is a great movie for what it is.  And unlike so many dreary films these days, this one has an actual storyline, a love interest, a dash of humor, and overall is great fun.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the ending.  Come on, Mary Jane is gorgeous, and Peter seems like a normal guy, excepting that he's Spider-man.  So what's the deal?  OK, I won't spoil it for you.Great fun.  My whole family just got done watching the DVD, and it was a fun evening.  My 4 year old son, 10 year old daughter, and their 48 year old dad all loved it.

Zwick,"[1, 6]","**1/2 Perhaps it isn't all ""Spider-Man""'s fault that it was released 24 years after the original ""Superman"" or 13 years after the original ""Batman"" movies.  But the fact is that those films beat this new film considerably to the punch, which probably explains why ""Spider-Man,"" for all its sophisticated special effects, feels decidedly Old Hat - especially compared to the infinitely more complex and sophisticated ""X-Men"" from a few years back, not to mention the brilliant ""Darkman"" from way back in 1990.  That last comparison is particularly apt since"" Spider-Man""'s director, Sam Raimi, virtually cut his teeth on that film.  In ""Darkman,"" Raimi brought a seriousness of purpose and a uniqueness of vision to the project that helped to carry the comic book movie genre to new artistic heights.  ""Spider-Man,"" though inoffensive, seems bland and benign in comparison, calculated to reach the widest audience possible (which apparently it has succeeded in doing, a fact that says less about the quality of the movie, perhaps, than about the undemanding tastes of modern moviegoers).""Spider-Man"" seems so by-the-book in its narrative, tone and purpose that it never soars much above the ordinary and never carries the audience to the kind of exciting, visionary world one would expect from a film of this type.  The movie is blessed in one all-important respect though: its inspired decision to cast Tobey Maguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, a mild mannered nerd who becomes a super hero after he's bitten by a genetically altered spider.  Maguire's winning and disarming performance is the film's one incontestable virtue.  All else seems problematic, beginning with the storyline, which plays virtually by rote.  One needn't list all the conventional elements, starting with the poor, picked-on geek who can't get the girl he loves to even acknowledge his existence, the loving, older guardians who support their boy in everything he does, the tortured super villain (in this case, the Green Goblin) who is both the hero's alter ego as well as his arch nemesis.  All this is, of course, par for the course, but I guess the thing I object to the most is that the tone is simply too innocuous and sunny.  The film can't generate any real suspense or excitement because the threats seem so halfhearted.  By the same token, the film doesn't have much of a playful spirit either.  The love scenes between Spider-Man and his truelove, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), work only because the actors themselves are so likable in the roles.  Otherwise, the romantic element is as underwhelming and clich&eacute;d as virtually every other feature of the film.  Probably the most unaccountable aspect of the plot is that, despite the fact that Spider-Man does only good for the citizens of Manhattan, we keep being told that the citizens are ambiguous in their attitudes towards him.  Yet, we are given no reason to credit this possibility for even a split second.  It is an arbitrary plot device thrown in to try and generate some desperately needed suspense in an admittedly pretty lackluster screenplay.Which pretty much leaves us with the special effects.  Though adequate at times, many of the shots of Spider-Man swooping along the streets of New York City, his web suspended from the tops of skyscrapers, seem strangely unconvincing.  Perhaps since we feel no immediate involvement in the proceedings, the special effects sequences never manage to catch us up in the excitement of what they are showing us.  One keeps hoping and expecting to be carried away by the film, but it simply never happens.""Spider-Man"" simply does not rate the box office revenue it has earned.",2,not up to the level of other comic book films,1024099200,"06 15, 2002",2002,3677,"['**1/2', 'Perhaps', ""n't"", 'Spider-Man', 'fault', 'was', 'released', '24', 'years', 'original', 'Superman', '13', 'years', 'original', 'Batman', 'movies', 'fact', 'films', 'beat', 'new', 'film', 'considerably', 'punch', 'probably', 'why', 'Spider-Man', 'sophisticated', 'special', 'effects', 'feels', 'decidedly', 'Old', 'Hat', 'especially', 'compared', 'infinitely', 'more', 'complex', 'sophisticated', 'X-Men', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'not', 'mention', 'brilliant', 'Darkman', 'way', 'back', '1990', 'last', 'comparison', 'particularly', 'apt', 'Spider-Man', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'virtually', 'cut', 'teeth', 'film', 'Darkman', 'Raimi', 'brought', 'seriousness', 'purpose', 'uniqueness', 'vision', 'project', 'helped', 'carry', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'genre', 'new', 'artistic', 'heights', 'Spider-Man', 'inoffensive', 'bland', 'benign', 'comparison', 'calculated', 'reach', 'widest', 'audience', 'possible', 'apparently', 'succeeded', 'doing', 'fact', 'less', 'quality', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'undemanding', 'tastes', 'modern', 'moviegoers', 'Spider-Man', 'so', 'by-the-book', 'narrative', 'tone', 'purpose', 'never', 'much', 'ordinary', 'never', 'audience', 'kind', 'exciting', 'visionary', 'world', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'type', 'movie', 'blessed', 'one', 'all-important', 'respect', 'inspired', 'decision', 'cast', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'lead', 'role', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'mild', 'mannered', 'nerd', 'who', 'super', 'hero', 'bitten', 'genetically', 'altered', 'spider', 'Maguire', 'winning', 'disarming', 'performance', 'film', 'one', 'incontestable', 'virtue', 'else', 'problematic', 'beginning', 'storyline', 'virtually', 'rote', 'One', 'need', ""n't"", 'list', 'conventional', 'elements', 'starting', 'poor', 'picked-on', 'geek', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'girl', 'even', 'acknowledge', 'existence', 'loving', 'older', 'guardians', 'who', 'support', 'boy', 'everything', 'tortured', 'super', 'villain', 'case', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'who', 'hero', 'alter', 'ego', 'as', 'well', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'course', 'par', 'course', 'guess', 'thing', 'object', 'most', 'tone', 'simply', 'too', 'innocuous', 'sunny', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'generate', 'real', 'suspense', 'excitement', 'threats', 'seem', 'so', 'halfhearted', 'same', 'token', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'playful', 'spirit', 'love', 'scenes', 'Spider-Man', 'truelove', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'work', 'only', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'likable', 'roles', 'Otherwise', 'romantic', 'element', 'underwhelming', 'clich', 'eacute', 'virtually', 'other', 'feature', 'film', 'Probably', 'most', 'unaccountable', 'aspect', 'plot', 'fact', 'Spider-Man', 'only', 'good', 'citizens', 'Manhattan', 'keep', 'being', 'told', 'citizens', 'are', 'ambiguous', 'attitudes', 'are', 'given', 'reason', 'credit', 'possibility', 'even', 'split', 'second', 'arbitrary', 'plot', 'device', 'thrown', 'try', 'generate', 'desperately', 'needed', 'suspense', 'admittedly', 'pretty', 'lackluster', 'screenplay.Which', 'pretty', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'adequate', 'times', 'many', 'shots', 'Spider-Man', 'swooping', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'web', 'suspended', 'tops', 'skyscrapers', 'seem', 'strangely', 'unconvincing', 'Perhaps', 'feel', 'immediate', 'involvement', 'proceedings', 'special', 'effects', 'sequences', 'never', 'manage', 'catch', 'up', 'excitement', 'what', 'are', 'showing', 'One', 'hoping', 'expecting', 'be', 'carried', 'away', 'film', 'simply', 'never', 'Spider-Man', 'simply', 'not', 'rate', 'box', 'office', 'revenue', 'earned']",N/A
585336,A1B3NP9BYLXX36,B00005JKCH,Ronald Bruce Meyer,"[2, 5]","Why wasn't this film a cartoon?That's the question that nagged me as I watched Spider-Man. I'm beginning to believe that Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) is a narcotic in Hollywood (second only to the addiction of exporting film industry jobs to Canada). Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi (who did so well directing A Simple Plan in 1998), represents the worst of both worlds.As with all movies taken from comic books, this character created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko for MARVEL comics - we are unpleasantly reminded of Marvel at the very first frame of the film - the story starts with the creation of our super-hero. A nerdy high school student (Tobey Maguire), with a passion for photography, is bitten by a genetically modified spider and gains spider-like abilities. These include great strength, agility, the ability to shoot webs from his wrists, and to kiss gorgeous babes while hanging upside-down. Well, maybe not that last one. As befits the super-hero tradition, his name begins with the same consonants (Peter Parker), and he is an orphan, brought up by kindly Aunt May Parker (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben Parker (a geezerlike and underutilized Cliff Robertson).The human story (screenplay by David ""Jurassic Park"" Koepp) is not so bad: Spidey, er, Peter, longs for the unattainable Mary Jane Watson (the gorgeous Kirsten Dunst, who I last saw in Crazy/Beautiful in 2001), who longs to be an actress. Trouble is, she sees everybody but Peter because Peter won't ask her out. She only notices him when he becomes Spider-Man... most guys know how that goes. But there's trouble in Gotham City - er, sorry, wrong super-hero! - a soon-to-be-mad scientist (Willem Dafoe, who I last saw in Auto-Focus, 2002), faced with a funding cut-off, transforms himself into an evil alter ego known as the Green Goblin (repeated consonants again). GG doesn't seem to have much purpose aside from urban mayhem, and he can't even move his face, but he does put MJ (Dunst) in danger a couple of times, providing Spider-Man with the occasion to save her life, and to give her that memorable kiss (actually, looking at MJ's rain-soaked sweater was more memorable for me). It's all filmed in New York and LA, too! So far so good.Granted, these are super-heroes portrayed by human actors and real people can't do these things, but I was seriously put off by the CGI/animation of the hero-villain fights. I'm not opposed to a little digital tinkering with reality, but I think the overuse of these effects (the CGI credits list is as long as Spidey's web) reduced the human element to infinitesimal. The characters might as well have populated a cartoon: there was nothing remotely realistic about them, especially their apparent weightlessness. There was never a moment in Spider-Man when I wondered if I was looking at a CGI effect or if I was looking at human actors; it was all fake. For me, this destroyed the verisimilitude, my willing suspension of disbelief mired in a suspension of belief. You can't have that in a movie that relies on a strong element of magic for its power.Maybe CGI is becoming too easy. Why wasn't this film a cartoon?

585340,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JKCH,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 4]","Peter Parker is a nerd barely accepted by the in crowd of his school, when he's bitten by a radioactive spider during a class trip.  Though he begins noticing changes immediately (whoa - I thought I was past that phase!!), he's too infatuated with the lovely Mary-Jane ""MJ"" Watson (Kirsten Dunst) to pay attention for long.  Soon he's planning on capitalizing on his new found post-puberty.  As Spider-fans know, Peter pays for his capitalist intentions, and learns the hard way how his new power brings new responsibilities.  Meanwhile, Norm Osborn, the embattled head of a high-tech defense contractor, goes slightly loony when subjecting himself to a chemical process designed to turn men into perfect killing machines.  Donning a mask and acquiring a split personality and an arsenal of high-tech, Osborn becomes the evil ""Green Goblin"".  As Peter remakes Spiderman into a crime-fighting hero, Osborn's Goblin eliminates his business rivals.  While not in disguise, Osborn is the somewhat off-center CEO and kind-hearted father of Peter's best friend - which fatefully brings him close enough to learn Parker's deepest secrets.  The movie works up to a climactic battle near Roosevelt Island where Peter must battle until their masks are stripped away.Though I haven't bought an issue of ""Spiderman"" this century, this fast-moving flick brought the whole experience back.  Though a lot of ""Spiderman"" draws on the comic series (and also turns up the fun for Sam Raimi fans), and much of the rest is generic comic book-turned big flashy movie fodder (hero must learn that much power brings loads of responsibility; the bad guy must destroy the hero, but not before trying to turn him to the dark side in the standard ""we've got a lot more in common than you think"" spiel) there's more than enough fun left over for the rest of us.  Sam Raimi keeps the action pumping, while never losing sight of his main characters.  The script surrounds Parker with characters that figured heavily in Parker's comic-art life - and even if you won't recognize Betty Brant or Robbie Robertson's characters, or think that ""Flash"" Thompson is just a school bully tossed in for Peter to get the better of, you at least get the sense that Raimi has something in mind for them.  Not to nit-pick, but it's also that unending sense of imminent surprise that grounds this flick - especially in the second half.  It's a problem because, Raimi touches aside (Bruce Campbell in a small but pivotal cameo; Raimi's trademark power-zoom camera-work; that Oldsmobile from ""Evil Dead"" and ""Army of Darkness"") the story is more faithful to the superhero formula than the original comic was.  Willem Dafoe is good as Osborn, but the character is not - once he's split, he's less than the sum of two parts (if Goblin is his own persona, what's the point of having him give pointers to Osborn?).  Though the original Spiderman relied on some detective smarts, the script here doesn't even attempt to put Parker on Osborn's trail (you'd think he would have seen a connection between Goblin and his murder of Osborn's business rivals).  But, like I said, there's more than enough fun here even for those who never picked up a copy of ""The Amazing Spiderman"".  This is obviously the same movie Raimi wanted to make about a decade ago, when he helmed ""Darkman"" (the last few minutes of each film are essentially the same) and it was well worth the wait.",4,"He webs, he scores!!",1052352000,"05 8, 2003",2003,3415,"['Peter', 'Parker', 'nerd', 'barely', 'accepted', 'crowd', 'school', 'when', 'bitten', 'radioactive', 'spider', 'class', 'trip', 'noticing', 'changes', 'immediately', 'thought', 'was', 'phase', 'too', 'infatuated', 'lovely', 'Mary-Jane', 'MJ', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'pay', 'attention', 'long', 'Soon', 'planning', 'capitalizing', 'new', 'found', 'post-puberty', 'Spider-fans', 'know', 'Peter', 'capitalist', 'intentions', 'hard', 'way', 'how', 'new', 'power', 'new', 'responsibilities', 'Meanwhile', 'Norm', 'Osborn', 'embattled', 'head', 'high-tech', 'defense', 'contractor', 'slightly', 'loony', 'when', 'subjecting', 'chemical', 'process', 'designed', 'turn', 'men', 'perfect', 'killing', 'machines', 'Donning', 'mask', 'acquiring', 'split', 'personality', 'arsenal', 'high-tech', 'Osborn', 'evil', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Peter', 'Spiderman', 'crime-fighting', 'hero', 'Osborn', 'Goblin', 'business', 'rivals', 'not', 'disguise', 'Osborn', 'somewhat', 'off-center', 'CEO', 'kind-hearted', 'father', 'Peter', 'best', 'friend', 'fatefully', 'close', 'enough', 'learn', 'Parker', 'deepest', 'secrets', 'movie', 'up', 'climactic', 'battle', 'Roosevelt', 'Island', 'where', 'Peter', 'must', 'battle', 'masks', 'are', 'stripped', 'have', ""n't"", 'bought', 'issue', 'Spiderman', 'century', 'fast-moving', 'flick', 'brought', 'whole', 'experience', 'back', 'lot', 'Spiderman', 'draws', 'comic', 'series', 'also', 'up', 'fun', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'fans', 'much', 'rest', 'generic', 'comic', 'book-turned', 'big', 'flashy', 'movie', 'fodder', 'hero', 'must', 'learn', 'much', 'power', 'loads', 'responsibility', 'bad', 'guy', 'must', 'destroy', 'hero', 'not', 'trying', 'turn', 'dark', 'side', 'standard', ""'ve"", 'got', 'lot', 'more', 'common', 'think', 'spiel', 'more', 'enough', 'fun', 'left', 'over', 'rest', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'action', 'pumping', 'never', 'losing', 'sight', 'main', 'characters', 'script', 'Parker', 'characters', 'figured', 'heavily', 'Parker', 'comic-art', 'life', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Betty', 'Brant', 'Robbie', 'Robertson', 'characters', 'think', 'Flash', 'Thompson', 'just', 'school', 'bully', 'tossed', 'Peter', 'get', 'better', 'least', 'get', 'sense', 'Raimi', 'something', 'mind', 'Not', 'nit-pick', 'also', 'unending', 'sense', 'imminent', 'surprise', 'flick', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'problem', 'Raimi', 'touches', 'aside', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'small', 'pivotal', 'cameo', 'Raimi', 'trademark', 'power-zoom', 'camera-work', 'Oldsmobile', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'story', 'more', 'faithful', 'superhero', 'formula', 'original', 'comic', 'was', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'good', 'Osborn', 'character', 'not', 'once', 'split', 'less', 'sum', 'two', 'parts', 'Goblin', 'own', 'persona', 'what', 'point', 'having', 'give', 'pointers', 'Osborn', 'original', 'Spiderman', 'relied', 'detective', 'smarts', 'script', 'here', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'put', 'Parker', 'Osborn', 'trail', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'connection', 'Goblin', 'murder', 'Osborn', 'business', 'rivals', 'said', 'more', 'enough', 'fun', 'here', 'even', 'who', 'never', 'picked', 'up', 'copy', 'Amazing', 'Spiderman', 'obviously', 'same', 'movie', 'Raimi', 'wanted', 'make', 'decade', 'ago', 'when', 'helmed', 'Darkman', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'was', 'well', 'wait']",N/A

Obviously, they had to show how Peter became Spiderman, but that doesn't have to take the whole movie, as we can clearly see. In fact, one of the things that really works here is that the origin of the hero and the origin of the villain are both developed as fast as they can and at the same time. The audience doesn't feel rushed at all in the process, and you may not even notice at first that the Goblin is created the very same night as Spiderman. Each wakes up a new man and then sets out to get to know their new abilities.Some of the Goblin's lines are hackneyed (""We'll meet again, Spiderman!"") but with Dafoe's delivery, you can see the theatrical megalomania as a natural part of the character. A few of the effects using CG characters could use a bit more polish to make them feel real, but they thankfully use real actors whenever realistically possible.On the whole, there are a few missteps here, but mainly on the technical aspect, which doesn't truly detract from the story.

585349,A1ERDXS0QLEVKB,B00005JKCH,rzaster,"[1, 1]","""Spider-Man"" is the second of three projected movies based on comic book characters from Marvel. This film is easily one of the best action movies that I've ever watched. The acting was phenomonal, the stunts great, the action superb, and the plot was outstanding. The plot of this film basically sets up Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man's life. It shows how he is not popular and is a geek in school and doesn't really fit in with the ""in"" crowd. It shows how he got bitten by the super spider and how his whole entire life was transformed from a high school kid into a crime fighting superhero. The main conflict in this film is between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin.This film is so monumental and had such a huge success at the box office because of the character of Spider-Man. Spider-Man has been around for about 40 years and this is the first live action screenplay featuring the loved superhero. Moviegoers and comic book readers can identify with Peter Parker because he is just an ordinary guy until he is bit by a spider. It is very easy to spot Peter's weaknesses and stengths and to compare them towards your own. Sam Raimi, the director of this film, succeeded so well in the production because he accurately portrayed Spider-Man, and all of the other characters for that matter, so well. Credit should also be given to the talented actors and actresses that starred in this movie. Those are the reasons for the huge success of this film.The portrayals of each character was done brilliantly because of great actors. Tobey Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker and suits the role that he is playing very well. Kirsten Dunst made a name for herself in this film as she played Mary Jane Watson, Spider-Man's crush. Dunst, Maguire, and all of the other actors in this film deserve much credit as the film would have been no where as good as it is if these people weren't in it.The action sequences were done marvelously and these scenes helped make the movie what it is. The costume and makeup team did a fabulous job and they did a great job of bringing Spider-Man and everybody elses' costumes alive. Finally, the drama was great and in every scene you will be able to feel for the characters. What made this film so great was that it was very realistic and it seems like the events in this film actually happened.""Spider-Man"" is definitely the best film that I've seen all year and this now holds a place in the top ten of my favorite films. This film will not only be enjoyed by comic book readers but by kids and adults that have never read a Spidey comic before. This is defintiely worth seeing many, many times. Now I'm in agony waiting for the DVD.Happy Viewing!",5,I'm Amazed,1020643200,"05 6, 2002",2002,2680,"['Spider-Man', 'second', 'three', 'projected', 'movies', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'Marvel', 'film', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'acting', 'was', 'phenomonal', 'stunts', 'great', 'action', 'superb', 'plot', 'was', 'outstanding', 'plot', 'film', 'basically', 'up', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'a.k.a', 'Spider-Man', 'life', 'how', 'not', 'popular', 'geek', 'school', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'crowd', 'how', 'got', 'bitten', 'super', 'spider', 'how', 'whole', 'entire', 'life', 'was', 'transformed', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'crime', 'fighting', 'superhero', 'main', 'conflict', 'film', 'Spider-Man', 'Green', 'Goblin.This', 'film', 'so', 'monumental', 'had', 'huge', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'character', 'Spider-Man', 'Spider-Man', 'been', '40', 'years', 'first', 'live', 'action', 'screenplay', 'featuring', 'loved', 'superhero', 'Moviegoers', 'comic', 'book', 'readers', 'can', 'identify', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'just', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'bit', 'spider', 'very', 'easy', 'spot', 'Peter', 'weaknesses', 'stengths', 'compare', 'towards', 'own', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'director', 'film', 'succeeded', 'so', 'well', 'production', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'Spider-Man', 'other', 'characters', 'matter', 'so', 'well', 'Credit', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'talented', 'actors', 'actresses', 'starred', 'movie', 'are', 'reasons', 'huge', 'success', 'film.The', 'portrayals', 'character', 'was', 'done', 'brilliantly', 'great', 'actors', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'perfect', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'suits', 'role', 'playing', 'very', 'well', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'made', 'name', 'herself', 'film', 'played', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Spider-Man', 'crush', 'Dunst', 'Maguire', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'deserve', 'much', 'credit', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'where', 'as', 'good', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'it.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'done', 'marvelously', 'scenes', 'helped', 'make', 'movie', 'what', 'costume', 'makeup', 'team', 'did', 'fabulous', 'job', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'Spider-Man', 'everybody', 'elses', 'costumes', 'alive', 'Finally', 'drama', 'was', 'great', 'scene', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'feel', 'characters', 'What', 'made', 'film', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'events', 'film', 'actually', 'happened', 'Spider-Man', 'definitely', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'now', 'place', 'top', 'ten', 'favorite', 'films', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'comic', 'book', 'readers', 'kids', 'adults', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Spidey', 'comic', 'before', 'defintiely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'Now', ""'m"", 'agony', 'waiting', 'DVD.Happy', 'Viewing']",N/A

It is true to his origins, develops the characters well and it connects very well on a human level. While there is humor, it is not the corny ""action hero"" humor that plagued so many Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and other superhero movies such as the Batman movies. In fact, the Spider-Man comic books themselves always had a good deal of humor and this movie is consistent with that. Even though Sam Raimi had established himself as a director prior to making the Spider-Man films, he is the perfect choice for this because he understands the character and the nature of this comic so well. So rarely is a superhero movie made by a director who fundamentally understands its subject. In that sense, this movie is a dream come true for fans of this comic. Until ""Batman Begins,"" this was really the first superhero movie to accurately portray its character onscreen. As with the comic books, it makes the violence seem as though it really should hurt, yet our hero is practically unscathed. This seems counterintuitive, yet it makes the movie faithful to its comic hero source and ultimately more realistic. And then there is the love story, which is realistic because Mary Jane dates Harry Osborn, the good looking, wealthy jerk actually unworthy of her. True to life, she dates him for all the wrong reasons and unwisely stays with him despite common sense. She is the unattainable for Peter Parker, the intelligent, thoroughly decent kid who has the misfortune of being penniless and average looking. Once he attains his powers, he knows he will forever endanger those close to him. This turns his ostensible blessing into a curse. Not an enviable position because it affects those closest to him. The movie features excellent graphics and effects, very good acting, a terrific story and script, and just about everything one could want in a movie.

Not only was the movie made but the movie was made RIGHT!Many directors and artists in Hollywood claim to be fans of comic book heroes, but when it comes time for them to actually put it together they fail miserably. But not here. Sam Rami is a TRUE Spider-man fan-- and he did what a true fan would do. He stayed true to the source and to the material. He captured the essence of Spider-man and his history. He didn't decide to pretentiously add his own mark like Tim Burton did with the laughable Batman movie. Rami stayed true to the comic.  This is the Spider-man I read about month for the last 13 years.I really did not think that anyone could top the X-Men, but Rami has and I don't just mean because of the special effets.  I also mean in terms of the plot and character development. This is not a long drawn out  movie filled with pointless violence.  It is a well plotted story that moves effortlessly from point to point. Who would have thought that so much could be fit into two hours?  And the end, I won't give it away , but who on earth would have thought that it would have ended that way. Instead of going for the same old boring  cliche Hollywood ending--Rami tacks on an original one which hints towards the future.Tobey Maguire was not my first choice to play Peter Parker. But boy does he deliver! I understand that he worked hard to get this part and boy does it show! He plays Peter just the way he was portrayed in the book! Kristen Dunst also was excellent,I did not think that she could pull off the part of Mary Jane. She's a lovely girl but not the super-model that MJ is in the comic book. But I was pleasantly surprised with what was done with the character.After being disapointed with the unseeminly endless rubish that Hollywood has produced lately I am now, in the words of Mr. Stan Lee, a true believer.

And they could have done so much more with it! Tobey Maguire was Ok acting-wise, but certainly not great; Kirsten Dunst was equally mediocre; The Aunt and Uncle weren't too bad.

All in all, it is an enjoyable but not *special* movie.

Spider-man fit that bill.  Marvel Comics prime superhero, his story is interesting, his facts everyone can relate to.Everything Peter is, Norman Osborn is too, except the Goblin is not a hero.  As the Goblin said, ""We are what we choose to be!""Norman's company is about to die a slow death.  He's not getting the military contracts he needs to keep the business going.  The board of directors is stonewalling him and demanding his resignation.  He must do something.Peter's life in high school is full of humiliation and fear.  He's not getting the respect he needs to keep his life going.  His ""friends"" are stonewalling him and demanding he get out of their way.  He must do something.Through the fate of a radioactive, genetically enhanced spider, Peter gets the power he needed to make some changes in his life.  Ah, what the Goblin would not do to possess such power.There is humor in the piece, but also a lot of raw human emotion.  If you have ever gone through teh grief process, you can relate to Aunt May and Peter's loss of Uncle Ben.  However, you can also relate to Harry Osborn's grief process with his father (not knowing Norman is the infamous goblin).Favorite scenes include the kissing scene, MJ's wet shirt, some funeral pathos, some New Yorkers getting angry, and Peter clueless about women.Sam Raimi put together a great story here, taking the basic elements of the original Marvel Comics tale and made some changes.  However, I still miss Gwen Stacy!The double-disc of the widescreen edition is really hot.  You have the film in Disc 1 and the usual scene selections.  In Disc 2, it's full of interviews, screen tests, special effects mysteries revealed and so on.  It's a cool package.A must-see.

Spiderman is the most impressive comic book turned to movie yet. I remember seeing Superman:the movie and in awe about how interesting it was. Christoper Reeve was Superman and I thought no one could have played him better. I feel the same way with Michael Keaton as Batman and now I can say the samething about Tobey Muguire.He stealed the show with his nerdish and cunning acts as Peter Parker Honestly I was never really was a Spiderman fan ,but I knew that there were comic books out that's really all I needed to know ,but the movie has changed my reasoning about Spiderman. I savered every second of that movie and hoped it would never end!!!Cheers for director Sam Raimi, who is known for his famous Evil Dead series (I've seen all of them at least a million times!)He has brought a lot of heart and compassion to this movie. When I realized last year he was making the movie, I said to myself he will make the diffinative Spiderman movie. Cheers for Kirsten Dunst as the girl next door, Mary Jane (M.J. for short).

Sam Raimi did not dissapoint and it has since become one of my favorite movies.  Not only is it one of my favorite movies, but it's also one of my favorite DVDs.  in typical Marvel style, this DVD is loaded with extra features that are just as entertaining as the film.The DVD features two excellent audio commentarys.  the first is by director Raimi, Producer Curtis, Actress Dunst, and producer Ziskin.  While a lot of DVD commentaries can get kind of confusing with 4 people talking, this commentary is actually split up, as Dunst and Ziskin recorded theirs at a seperate time than Raimi and Curtis.  The audio will switch back and forth between the two depending on who had the most interesting comment about a scene. I actually watched the film with the commentary immediately after watching the movie, something which I can never usually do because I get bored too easily.The second commentary is by the visual effects team.  I wasn't as entertained with this one but it is fairly interesting to hear their stories about what went on with the stunt work and some of the scenes.Two music videos are included, as well as HBO and E! ""Making-Of"" featurettes.  One of my favorite DVD extras are the screen tests with Toby Maguire and J.K. Simmons (JJ Jameson).  These are always a lot of fun to watch.  The DVD is further fleshed out by a short outttake reel and trailers.Then Marvel comes in, and includes all kinds of comic-book extras that explore the history of Spider-Man in the comics, Peter Parker's girlfriends, some common Spider-Man enemies, and an excellent comic book archive.Even with all of that, there are still features I haven't mentioned, like a ""Spider-Sense"" navigational feature that lets you click on an icon at certain points in the film. This brings up mini featurettes that explore things like how a production set was designed or an interview with the ""Spider-Wrangler.""This is a fantastic film, and an even better DVD that has just enough information and fatures for the most hard core Spider-Man fans.

I wasn't certain what to expect of the film, particularly being a huge Spider-Man fanatic as a kid who was hooked on the cartoon. This film pleasantly met all of my expectations as a Spider-Man fan and as a novelist and screenwriter. It is a wonderful story about young Peter Parker who is bitten by a high powered genetically enhanced spider, which transforms him from a nerd into the crime fighting, web spinning Spider-Man. The main storyline is accompanied by a touching subplot that involves the childhood love of Peter's heart, Mary Jane(MJ) played by Kirsten Dunst. As these two storylines interweave, Peter expresses his long overdue affection for MJ in dramatic fashion by springing to her rescue as the high flying superhero. As in all superhero stories, it would not be a good story without a formidable adversary. No one could have played the role of the &quot;Green Goblin&quot; better than Willem Dafoe, who gave an absolutely superb performance. This film pulls the viewer into a nail-biting conclusion as the Goblin and Spider-Man clash in the finale, bringing the audience to a breathtaking and satisfying climax.

585366,A2UGVZFKH8O5X4,B00005JKCH,Sean Parauka,"[0, 0]","This real-life comic book movie, Spiderman is outstandingly fantastic. Tobey Maguire did an excellent job as Peter Parker/Spiderman. Along with him was Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, who Peter is desperately in love with. Willem Dafoe did great playing the evil villan, the Green Goblin. The movie is full of action-packed special effects, great action scenes and full of adventure.The movie starts out with Peter Parker (Maguire), a high school science nerd who everyone constantly picks on (even the bus driver). The first scene is Peter chasing his school bus down the street and the bus driver keeps going just to annoy him. On his fieldtrip with classmates to a science lab, a genetically altered spider that escaped from the lab comes down from a web and bites his hand while taking pictures. Now he goes home to get some rest. The next morning he wakes up and the first weird thing he notices is when he puts his glasses on he can't see. When he takes them off he can see perfectly (Remember: Spiders can't see with glasses). The next thing he notices is all of-a-sudden his body is ripped. He is suddenly very muscular like. Imagine that. The next weird thing that happens is when he chases his bus AGAIN, his hand touches the sign on the bus and it rips off with his hand. His hand is sticky (Spider's have sticky hands for gripping). It's pretty cool what happens at school with these powers. See what happens there. Now he leaves school in shock and starts to climb an alley wall with his bare hands like a Spider. Then he jumps over twenty feet building to building and then tests his web by flying with it over a gap of fifty feet. Cool! To put his powers to the test, he enrolls in a wrestling match against Macho Man Randy Savage. Will he win?Here is where the stuff hits the fan. Peter's friend Harry's father Norman Osborn is the founder os Oscorp, a science lab that invents weapons for the military. After a he does a experiment on himself to enhance human strength, it goes bad. He has an evil side now and he becomes the Green Goblin. He first blows up a test sight for some military hovercraft. Now at a huge fair that Oscorp sponsors he attacks everyone. He attempts to destroy a balcony full of people, including Harry and Mary Jane. Here comes Spiderman. The start to bash it out. Right now Spiderman wins and saves Mary Jane. Next, at the Daily Bugle where Peter works as a photographer, the Green Goblin comes and demands to know who takes the photos of Spiderman. Spiderman shows up and the Green Goblin makes Spiderman fall asleep with some kind of gas. Goblin offers Spiderman a truce to join forces and of course he turns it down.Now that Spiderman turned the offer down, the Goblin finds out who he is and goes after the people he loves. Here is the final bash. Goblin has Spiderman at his knees because on top of the Brooklyn bridge, Goblin holds Mary Jane over on edge of the bridge on one side. On the other side, he holds a wire that is connected to a transportation cab full of people. He drops both. NOW HERE GOES SPIDERMAN! Can he actually do both? Now I'll let you know Goblin is really angry that he lost. Now they finally have it out. First Goblin drops a small bomb next to Spiderman and cuts him badly and rips half his mask off. Now he has to use his Spider webs to pull a wall down on Goblin and it comes down to the last straw. To the DEATH! Punch after punch Spiderman attacks Goblin.

They have a lot of talking in this movie as well. It isn't just some all out action movie with no words at al, which is common in superhero movies. I think this is the best superhero series there is. Overall, I'd say its even better than X-Men, which was another solid superhero series that I personally enjoyed. But enough of the good and in with the bad. The action sometimes looked fake, and they made it too obvious that the scenes where he is swinging on the webs are fake. Also, the Green Goblin costume wasn't very well designed, and looked like something more from Zoolander. But it was still a good movie. So if you like superheroes, or if you just want to see an unsually good action movie that has more to it than just plain action (such as love, friendships, and struggles for power) than this is the movie for you.

I am not a big fan of superhero movies and knew nothing about the story or the comics. I prepared to be uninterested. Well, I prepared wrong. This movie was EXCELLENT, and it wasn't just another superhero movie with lots of action scenes. I really cared for the characters here and sympathised with all of them.I thought the motive for Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man was very well done. I really hate sitting through the scene where Peter finds his uncle shot and realises that it was partly his fault. That must've been brutal. Tobey Maguire and Cliff Robertson are both excellent in that scene. The last scene is also heartbreaking to hear Peter have to say that to Mary Jane (I won't spoil here), it kind of pisses me off at the same time as being very sad.All of the performances here are great. Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man is a sight to behold. I didn't think Maguire could pull off a superhero, but he is amazing as both the nerdy Peter Parker and as the wall-crawling hero. I also loved Willem Dafoe. He is a great actor, and chooses very diverse and complex roles. Here he has to be scizophrenic, evil, leader of a successful business and a father. He mixes all these things up in some scenes and the outcome is one great performance. Kirsten Dunst is also stunning and makes her character more three-dimensional than I bet any other actress could. She was perfectly cast and I love her hair like that.There were some outstanding action sequences in Spider-Man, including the final battle between the Goblin and Spider-Man, which showcases some brilliant sound effects. The scenes at the parade and also on the bridge were intense, scary and unpredictable, and especially the one at the parade had me practically falling off my seat in tension.If there were things I didn't like about the film they would just be stupid little things. I don't like how the Goblin says ""Itsy bitsy Spider came up the water spout. Down came the Goblin and washed the Spider out!"" It is a lame, cheesy and unneeded line. The end really gets on my nerves but brings across the motto of the movie in a brilliant and heartbreaking fashion - so I wouldn't call it a flaw.Overall - a brilliant movie. If you don't like superhero flicks that's OK, because I don't and I LOVED LOVED LOVED this movie. I now own the DVD and watch it often. This is more than a superhero movie, much much more, and I can't wait to see the sequel.--- DVD REVIEW ---I own this DVD as I mentioned up there and I really love it. The special features are a sight to behold, there are many that really inform you on the movie. Unlike most films, the DVD has a lot of information and featurettes on both discs, whereas with most movies there's usually two discs, one with the film and one with the features. But this movie is packed with lots of features to enjoy. I love watching gags and there is a short gag reel. There is a few documentaries on the casting choices in the movie.

585374,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B00005JKCH,Simon,"[1, 1]","It's hard to dislike a movie that made comic book adaptations cool to the general public again. X-Men raised interest, but it was Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film that really showed people what could be done, both in terms of narrative and special effects. So while I don't dislike the movie, and recognize its importance in opening the floodgates for other superhero flicks, it's still not one that particularly sticks out for me.I feel Spider-Man is too workman-like. It excels at putting all the pieces together, but it lacks the stylistic touches that Burton brought to Batman, or that Donner did with the old Superman films. The film gets everything right, from the origin story to the crush on Mary Jane. Some liberities were taken with the Goblin and his costume, but I felt they were acceptable for translating the character and getting his part of the story rolling. And yes, the web-slinging sequences are amazing. But mostly, the film just lacked character for me. It impresses because they got it right, but thats only in comparison to the dozens of superhero adaptations where everything was totally wrong. Once I got past the faithfulness to the source material, Raimi didn't seem to put his personal stamp on the film.There was also way too much of the romantic triangle for me. I think the stuff they had here could've been played out over 2 or even 3 movies, and it comes off feeling very rushed. Considering they rehashed it for the sequel, they really should've slowed things down here.In all, Spider-Man is a good film. It lacks a certain distinctive quality for me and isn't my prefered superhero film to watch, but I'm glad I own a copy of it. The dvd offers decent picture and sound, and some okay extras. Commentary is boring, and the documentaries focus more on the spider-man mythology than the film's production.

585377,AAQ75C4BJUQLO,B00005JKCH,Sixto Limiac,"[1, 6]","*Warning: Spoilers Abound*After sitting through this movie, mixed feelings kept flooding in me.  Needless to say, at 12:20 a.m. I decided to call it a night and crash out.  I drove home, crawled into my bed (not in a Spider-Man fashion, mind you), and I wondered, I pondered, and I wondered some more.  Was I fully content with the movie?  Was it as maddeningly irksome as Episode II?  But ultimately, what did the comic-to-film adaptation of Spider-Man warrant score-wise?  Unquestionably, it left an impact on me, confirming me to get off my kister, get all fired up, and subsequently ripen a review.  The initial rating would have maybe landed on a 2 or 3-Star rating at best, but as slumber began taking its toll on my eyes, I heard the exceptional musical score reemerge into my eardrums, I remembered those number of ridiculously amusing scenes instigating an outburst of guffaws throughout the audience, and when I began to visualize the incredibly nimble Spider-Man slinging throughout the golden Manhattan, my first impulse dramatically altered.  Despite its enjoyable instances, the flaws began to supplant the finest moments.  The Green Goblin's costume comes across an unworldly and outlandishly getup that'll probably never see a light in the distant future.  I'm not a big fan of Spider-Man comics, but for the sake of comic book quibbles I have to admit that Gwen Stacy should have been implemented in the film, because after all she was Parker's first love.  Was she not?  Moreover, Kristen Dunst just doesn't cut it, she doesn't portray the highly sophisticated Mary Jane Watson.  Although the scene where Parker is figuring out how to work his web-shooting was hilarious, why did Stan Lee and his gang give a thumbs up to revise the original method of Spider-Man using web cartridges?  I'm not too big of a fan of comics but when stories begin to get modified for the ""rules of Hollywood,"" I get infuriated.  However, in spite of  the cases that I categorize as flaws, they are all MINOR.  Most importantly, Spider-Man retains the tone of the pages where he originated.  The movie is not supposed to be dark and isn't.  It takes itself seriously when the situation calls for it, thus it closely correlates with the comics.  The day after Peter Parker was bitten by the genetically enhanced spider (by the way, it actually doesn't skitter away in the Spidey pages, it fell lifelessly to the ground after it sunk its incisors on Parker), was a excellent scene as Parker invests time to master his powers and simultaneously worsens his relationship with his Uncle Ben.  The wrestling match was just as brilliant, as Macho Man was ill-equipped for the totality of Spider-Man's fleetness and his chain of gut-wrenching kicks.  Full of sarcastic humor, ""your friendly neighborhood Spider-man,"" digs up all the glory for accomplishing an extraordinary adaptation on the big screen.  The movie stirred up excitement, engrossment, and overall kept me satisfied for spending serious dough on costly tickets.  Even though I thought a 3-Star rating would do the justice, my comic book fancy and sensibilities were bursting in elation, and I was finally decisive to give the wall-crawler the whole package.  That's right.  Forget that 4-Star rating at the top, this movie merits all of them!  It's not easy to pull of such a feat in which Spider-Man has pulled off, Marvel rips up the competition and I'm roaring in delight!  I was repulsed by the corny X-Men, I loathed all the Batman movies when Keaton retired as the Dark Knight, and lastly I absolutely detested the Superman Saga, but for the first time, I have fallen for a comic-book-flick that nearly meets all my expectations.  As for the sequel, I pray that it won`t revolve around the Legacy of the Green Goblin, but of Spider-Man's more sinister villains such as Venom, but for that to happen is next to impossible because of all the background story and not to mention a trip to the cosmos.  Maybe the return of the Goblin won't be so bad after all, but as history repeat itself, sequels frequently drop below the achievement repute of its predecessor, yet only time and the fortitude of those behind the future design of Spider-Man 2 will tell.  Let's all  hope it reaches Terminator 2 status, and not moldy Episode II baloney.",4,Was it as maddeningly irksome as Episode II?,1022630400,"05 29, 2002",2002,4295,"['*Warning', 'Spoilers', 'Abound*After', 'sitting', 'movie', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'kept', 'flooding', 'Needless', 'say', '12:20', 'a.m', 'decided', 'call', 'night', 'crash', 'drove', 'home', 'crawled', 'bed', 'not', 'Spider-Man', 'fashion', 'wondered', 'pondered', 'wondered', 'more', 'Was', 'fully', 'content', 'movie', 'Was', 'maddeningly', 'irksome', 'Episode', 'II', 'ultimately', 'what', 'did', 'comic-to-film', 'adaptation', 'Spider-Man', 'warrant', 'score-wise', 'Unquestionably', 'left', 'impact', 'confirming', 'get', 'off', 'kister', 'get', 'fired', 'up', 'subsequently', 'ripen', 'review', 'initial', 'rating', 'would', 'have', 'maybe', 'landed', '2', '3-Star', 'rating', 'best', 'slumber', 'began', 'taking', 'toll', 'eyes', 'heard', 'exceptional', 'musical', 'score', 'reemerge', 'eardrums', 'remembered', 'number', 'ridiculously', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'instigating', 'outburst', 'guffaws', 'audience', 'when', 'began', 'visualize', 'incredibly', 'nimble', 'Spider-Man', 'slinging', 'golden', 'Manhattan', 'first', 'impulse', 'dramatically', 'altered', 'enjoyable', 'instances', 'flaws', 'began', 'supplant', 'finest', 'moments', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'costume', 'unworldly', 'outlandishly', 'getup', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'see', 'light', 'distant', 'future', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Spider-Man', 'comics', 'sake', 'comic', 'book', 'quibbles', 'have', 'admit', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'implemented', 'film', 'was', 'Parker', 'first', 'love', 'Was', 'not', 'Moreover', 'Kristen', 'Dunst', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', ""n't"", 'portray', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'scene', 'where', 'Parker', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'work', 'web-shooting', 'was', 'hilarious', 'why', 'did', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'gang', 'give', 'thumbs', 'up', 'revise', 'original', 'method', 'Spider-Man', 'using', 'web', 'cartridges', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'big', 'fan', 'comics', 'when', 'stories', 'begin', 'get', 'modified', 'rules', 'Hollywood', 'get', 'infuriated', 'However', 'spite', 'cases', 'categorize', 'flaws', 'are', 'MINOR', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Spider-Man', 'tone', 'pages', 'where', 'originated', 'movie', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'dark', ""n't"", 'seriously', 'when', 'situation', 'thus', 'closely', 'comics', 'day', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'was', 'bitten', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'spider', 'way', 'actually', ""n't"", 'skitter', 'away', 'Spidey', 'pages', 'fell', 'lifelessly', 'ground', 'sunk', 'incisors', 'Parker', 'was', 'excellent', 'scene', 'Parker', 'time', 'master', 'powers', 'simultaneously', 'relationship', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'wrestling', 'match', 'was', 'just', 'brilliant', 'Macho', 'Man', 'was', 'ill-equipped', 'totality', 'Spider-Man', 'fleetness', 'chain', 'gut-wrenching', 'kicks', 'Full', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'Spider-man', 'up', 'glory', 'accomplishing', 'extraordinary', 'adaptation', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'stirred', 'up', 'excitement', 'engrossment', 'overall', 'kept', 'satisfied', 'spending', 'serious', 'dough', 'costly', 'tickets', 'Even', 'thought', '3-Star', 'rating', 'would', 'do', 'justice', 'comic', 'book', 'fancy', 'sensibilities', 'were', 'bursting', 'elation', 'was', 'finally', 'decisive', 'give', 'wall-crawler', 'whole', 'package', 'right', 'Forget', '4-Star', 'rating', 'top', 'movie', 'not', 'easy', 'pull', 'such', 'feat', 'Spider-Man', 'pulled', 'off', 'Marvel', 'up', 'competition', ""'m"", 'roaring', 'delight', 'was', 'repulsed', 'corny', 'X-Men', 'loathed', 'Batman', 'movies', 'when', 'Keaton', 'retired', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'lastly', 'absolutely', 'detested', 'Superman', 'Saga', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'fallen', 'comic-book-flick', 'nearly', 'expectations', 'sequel', 'pray', 'won', 't', 'revolve', 'Legacy', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Spider-Man', 'more', 'sinister', 'villains', 'such', 'Venom', 'happen', 'next', 'impossible', 'background', 'story', 'not', 'mention', 'trip', 'cosmos', 'Maybe', 'return', 'Goblin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'history', 'repeat', 'sequels', 'frequently', 'drop', 'achievement', 'repute', 'predecessor', 'yet', 'only', 'time', 'fortitude', 'future', 'design', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'will', 'tell', 'Let', 'hope', 'Terminator', '2', 'status', 'not', 'moldy', 'Episode', 'II', 'baloney']",N/A

It starts well enough and Peter Parkers discovery of his new found powers is well done both in the School scenes and later in the wrestling/cage fight. The fight in the school is very well done and Parker's discovery of his new much faster reactions remains perhaps the highpoint of the film. Its in this section of the film that the director Sam Raimi's touch is most evident.However the film loses momentum and gets more and more predictable as it progresses and in the end was certainly too long. The leading actors did a fine job and the best thing in the film is Tobey Maquire, whose portrayal is spot-on. There are extras galore on disc 2 as well as commentaries on on disc 1.

585379,A1DUIWDZCNJIHA,B00005JKCH,"Slade Simon ""slade37""","[0, 0]","When I see over 500 reviews on a title, I normally won't write one. However, I felt I needed to comment on a couple of items. I hope I don't repeat too much of what's already been said.First off, this is a great movie. I relate WAY too much to Peter Parker, and I'm reminded of many personal issues while watching the movie. Yes, the characters have some depth in this movie adaption as well as in the comics. J. K. Simmons is great as Jameson!!Only one Spider-Man trailer is on the DVD, and it's one I had never seen. It's not the trailer that showed Peter on the school trip taking photos of MJ. I think that one was the original trailer (not teaser) that was on the Spider-Man web site. The trailer on the DVD used the same music that was recently used in a Toyota Camry ad. The Spider-Man TV ads are also ones I had not seen. Not all of the promotional ads are included. The Cingular ad that used Spider-Man is here. Trailers for other movies are included: XXX, Men In Black II, Mr. Deeds. ...and a couple of others.I do feel the DVD menu could have been done better. It's not very clear which item is currently selected on the main menu. On the sub-menus, it's better except for items at the bottom that match the format of the main menu. You have to look for the little dots next to the item which will show it's selected. Nothing is highlighted, just those dots.The Pop-up Factoids are nice. They provide much background information about the movie and comics. Different graphics are used depending on which is being discussed. There is a black & white drawing based on the comics used as a border for anything related to the comics. Everything else uses a blue box with a color drawing of Spider-Man on one of the borders. There are a few typos like a ""w"" missing from the word ""wrestling"" on one. Proofreading could have been better, but it's not that bad. The typos mainly involved missing letters.There was one error that I found in the Factoids. Just after Aunt May mentions that everyone knows how Peter feels about Mary Jane, there are a few facts about the use of phone booths in comics. The BBC series, Dr. Who, used a police box, not a phone booth.Technical issues aside, Spider-Man is a great movie. Things that were changed for the movies can be debated, but I can understand the reasons for the changes. Green Goblin's suit was changed because it was the suit worn for the glider which was for a military contract. It needed to look like armor, not the original purple and green fabric. The glider suit didn't seem to include any helmet in the earlier shots. Although it wasn't as obvious, the Goblin wore a mask in the comic too. The idea of the mask becoming more of a helmet for the armour makes sense.It would have been nice to see the comic book version of everything, but I'm not totally against the updates. (I'm only familiar with the older comics - mainly reprints of the original ones from the 1960s.) Some details need to be changed because of the times. The public attitude toward radiation isn't the same as it was in the early '60s when the movies would show us all kinds of monsters and mutations created by it. Today, genetic engineering makes more sense.This is a great movie for fans, and the human issues make it more than simply a comic book movie. I would recommend the movie highly to fans and non-fans.Trivia: Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben) also appeared in the Batman TV series as the villian, Shame.",5,Some Extra Comments,1036627200,"11 7, 2002",2002,3441,"['When', 'see', '500', 'reviews', 'title', 'normally', 'wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'one', 'However', 'felt', 'needed', 'comment', 'couple', 'items', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'said.First', 'off', 'great', 'movie', 'relate', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'Peter', 'Parker', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'many', 'personal', 'issues', 'watching', 'movie', 'Yes', 'characters', 'have', 'depth', 'movie', 'adaption', 'as', 'well', 'comics', 'J.', 'K.', 'Simmons', 'great', 'Jameson', 'Only', 'one', 'Spider-Man', 'trailer', 'DVD', 'one', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'not', 'trailer', 'showed', 'Peter', 'school', 'trip', 'taking', 'photos', 'MJ', 'think', 'one', 'was', 'original', 'trailer', 'not', 'teaser', 'was', 'Spider-Man', 'web', 'site', 'trailer', 'DVD', 'used', 'same', 'music', 'was', 'recently', 'used', 'Toyota', 'Camry', 'ad', 'Spider-Man', 'TV', 'ads', 'are', 'also', 'ones', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Not', 'promotional', 'ads', 'are', 'included', 'Cingular', 'ad', 'used', 'Spider-Man', 'here', 'Trailers', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'included', 'XXX', 'Men', 'Black', 'II', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'couple', 'others.I', 'do', 'feel', 'DVD', 'menu', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'not', 'very', 'clear', 'item', 'currently', 'selected', 'main', 'menu', 'sub-menus', 'better', 'items', 'bottom', 'match', 'format', 'main', 'menu', 'have', 'look', 'little', 'dots', 'next', 'item', 'will', 'show', 'selected', 'Nothing', 'highlighted', 'just', 'dots.The', 'Pop-up', 'Factoids', 'are', 'nice', 'provide', 'much', 'information', 'movie', 'comics', 'Different', 'graphics', 'are', 'used', 'depending', 'being', 'discussed', 'black', 'white', 'drawing', 'based', 'comics', 'used', 'border', 'anything', 'related', 'comics', 'Everything', 'else', 'blue', 'box', 'color', 'drawing', 'Spider-Man', 'one', 'borders', 'are', 'few', 'typos', 'w', 'missing', 'word', 'wrestling', 'one', 'Proofreading', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'not', 'bad', 'typos', 'mainly', 'involved', 'missing', 'letters.There', 'was', 'one', 'error', 'found', 'Factoids', 'Just', 'Aunt', 'May', 'mentions', 'everyone', 'how', 'Peter', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'are', 'few', 'facts', 'use', 'phone', 'booths', 'comics', 'BBC', 'series', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'used', 'police', 'box', 'not', 'phone', 'booth.Technical', 'issues', 'aside', 'Spider-Man', 'great', 'movie', 'Things', 'were', 'changed', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'debated', 'can', 'understand', 'reasons', 'changes', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'suit', 'was', 'changed', 'was', 'suit', 'worn', 'glider', 'was', 'military', 'contract', 'needed', 'look', 'armor', 'not', 'original', 'purple', 'green', 'fabric', 'glider', 'suit', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'include', 'helmet', 'earlier', 'shots', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'obvious', 'Goblin', 'wore', 'mask', 'comic', 'too', 'idea', 'mask', 'becoming', 'more', 'helmet', 'armour', 'sense.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'comic', 'book', 'version', 'everything', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'updates', ""'m"", 'only', 'familiar', 'older', 'comics', 'mainly', 'reprints', 'original', 'ones', '1960s', 'details', 'need', 'be', 'changed', 'times', 'public', 'attitude', 'radiation', ""n't"", 'same', 'was', 'early', ""'60s"", 'when', 'movies', 'would', 'show', 'kinds', 'monsters', 'mutations', 'created', 'Today', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'more', 'sense.This', 'great', 'movie', 'fans', 'human', 'issues', 'make', 'more', 'simply', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'fans', 'non-fans.Trivia', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'also', 'appeared', 'Batman', 'TV', 'series', 'villian', 'Shame']",N/A

Well let me say one thing.THEY DIDN'T!  This was the greatest comicbook movie ever.  Step aside Superman, Batman, and X-Men.  There is a new hero in town, and he's kickin' some major rear-end.  I've seen this six times so far, and so far it hasn't gotten boring.  They started right by getting Sam Raimi to direct.  When I heard that I knew it would be good, but then I heard DiCaprio's name being thrown out to play Peter Parker, and I was scared.  Luckily they came to their senses, and cast Tobey Maguire, who did a fabulous job.  He was Peter Parker.  Then I heard there would be no Doc Ock, instead Norman Osbourne, The Green Goblin.  At first I heard John Malkovich would play this part, which would have been interesting, but I think they picked correctly when they chose Willem Defoe.  He was creepy as Norman Osbourne.  Kirsten Dunst was great as Mary Jane, but I think Julia Stiles may have been better, I just think she's a better actress.  But Kirsten did a great job.  The story was fantastic.  There was action, comedy, sadness, and even a love story for the ladies.  So it touched all your emotions.  And a two hour movie in an age where a movie that lasts an hour and forty minutes is long, was great.More bang for your buck, and it didn't drag.  They stayed pretty true to the comic, not exactly but who cares, it was still the best big studio movie I've seen in a while.  If you haven't seen it, What the HECK are you waiting for?  The DVD?  You gotta see this one in the theater.  Get out of your house and go see it ya net-nerd. Jeez, what's wrong with you?  There's something other to do than screw around on your computer all day!

(1) First and foremost, Peter Parker's love for Mary Jane comes up WAY too many times. He tells us at the beginning that he loves her. Then he says it again. Then he shows it in his actions. Then Aunt May mentions it. Then Harry Osborn mentions it. Okay, okay. We GET it. One time would have been enough. (2) Why cover up Willem Dafoe's face? Once he has the mask on, it could be anyone under there. And he has a good face for the Green Goblin. (3) The special effects are bad half the time. Yes, that's a CGI Spiderman beating up bad guys in the alley. It's obvious. (4) Macy Gray? Why? (5) Mary Jane's protuberances in the rain are, let's say, out of place. But they ARE memorable.There are a few good things. It's not all bad. (1) The casting is good. Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker. Even Aunt May is well-cast.

He's too old for it, but fifteen years ago Arnold would have been ideal.The special effects were absolutely thrilling.  Everything looked great with the vital exception of Spiderman himself.  In fact, my biggest problem with the movie is that Spidey looks like a cartoon character swinging around.  They should have used a real person.The DVD looks and sounds totally acceptable.

585387,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005JKCH,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[1, 3]","I have to admit that I was not one of the legion of fans that was blown away by this film even though it was based on my all-time favorite comic-book hero, but I did see lots of potential for this latest comic-book to film series and history has proven me right there as I am writing this review after its first two sequels have come out.  Yeah, I know, I'm cheating a bit here and Monday morning quarterbacking.The film is cast well, overall, especially Peter Parker's aunt and uncle played by Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, and MJ is played with surprisingly pleasing spunk and charm by Kirsten Dunst who can normally be ""distant"" in whatever role she plays.  All other supporting cast members are equally good and memorable; however, the main stars Tobey Maguire as Spidey/Parker and Willem Defoe as The Green Goblin are a little problematic.Tobey is perfect as Peter Parker, a young nerdy kid with a crush on the school's popular girl.  He is also very convincing during the sequences in which he is discovering his new-found abilities.  It is in the voice-overs of the CGI Spider-Man that we run into problems.  For me, he just wasn't convincing as he was often monotone.  That nasal quality he has when he speaks works well as Peter Parker, but as Spider-Man, he lacks the punch of a hero in his voice and his sense of comic-timing, a Spider-Man trademark, seems way off.In addition to the problems with Maguire as Spider-Man, I am even more dismayed by Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin.  I just couldn't accept him in his ""normal"" role as a world leading scientist.  He seems too much like a lunatic from the get-go and although he eventually becomes a wonderfully sinister Goblin, with the perfect voice for the role, he is a bit over-the-top in that part of his role as well.  He's like the Incredible Hulk on steriods.  It was absolutely laughable in a few segments where I don't think it was intended.As with all ""introduction"" episodes of a new comic-book transfer to the silver screen, the exposition of the film is long-winded and it takes quite some time to get the story rolling, but when it does, it is a compelling, and at times, moving plot, especially when it focuses on Parker's various relationships.  I give Sam Rami, the director, and his writers kudos for that balancing act.Speaking of balancing acts, the effects are way over-the-top in that the CGI effects simply move too fast for the human eye to keep up with and when they do slow down, you can clearly notice that it is all CGI, and that really annoys me.  I would like to see more actual stunt work, a la Superman and Batman, than a ""virtual"" Spider-Man.  They need to seriously work on that aspect of this series.Okay, Steve, then why 3 1/2 stars for this film where you have so much negative to say.  Well, it has a lot to do with being glad that Spidey finally made it to the silver screen.  I grew up on this comic-book and seeing him on the screen just brings a smile to my face in spite of whatever flaws may be present.  Some of the casting might be flawed, but they are good overall and Tobey Maguire may grown into the role as time marches on.  The film is fun to watch as any comic-book to film should be, and the effects are good enough to sustain the film although they need to work on the realism factor.

He played the nerd turned hero with style (however a little stiff as the nerd). Kirsten Dunst was good-she had a better turning in Dracula. However Willam DeFoe was superb. He played the super rich scientist, turned villian/split personality with a style matched only by Jack Nicholson in Batman. The minor players such as J. Jonah Jamison, Aunt Mae and DeFoe's son were okay.The story was fairly true to the original story. The only difference is that this Spiderman can shoot webs from his skin (wrist) and not man made cartridges. I like the idea of shooting webs from his skin more fessible than the latter way.The only problem I had with the whole thing is that, it relied on computer generated effects (for Spidey) too much. Most of his acrobatics were too unnatural for human movement. &lt;You lose the sense of humanity when you rely on the computer more than stunt players.

585402,A2ICYTQK3ZCX0Z,B00005JKCH,The Great Rocky Hill,"[13, 16]","I was afraid to see this movie. I was afraid that I'd be disappointed,afraid that this would be a farce or a live-action cartoon with no human interest and that it would kill everyone's perception of everything that the comic book medium could be.I wasn't sure about Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst being in the movie. I was concerned when I heard they were making Spidey's webbing organic and threw out the web-shooter idea. I became dismayed when I read that Roger Ebert only gave it 2 1/2 stars and at this point,almost had to be coaxed into seeing the film.You see,I'm a lifelong comics fan and Spider-Man is my all-time favorite comic book hero.I have grown-up with him. Peter Parker looks like me,and I've always felt that I was him. He was the first comics character I felt I could relate to. The comics have had their ups and downs creatively throught the years,but all in all,I've remained loyal to 'ol Webhead(J.Michael Straczynski and John Romita Jr. are really working wonders with the character these days) I almost thought we were going to see ""Spider-Teen"" or ""Spider-Dude"". I was afraid to see this movie.Boy, were Ebert and I dead wrong! There were minor problems with it,I felt,but overall,""Spider-Man"" was everything I had hoped it would be:the best darn comic book movie ever made. Roger Ebert felt that the action sequences were fake-looking and said that ""Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon"" handled this type of superhumanity more effectively.I felt ""Spider-Man"" captured Spidey's actions perfectly. In the movie,Spider-Man and the Green Goblin have the fluidity in their movements that reminds one of the Lee/Ditko Spider-Man era. Spidey fights like he does in the comics(throwing guys around,double-punches,etc.)and the Green Goblin is as sinister, dangerous,and cunning as a large predator on the loose. The fight scenes are choreographed well,evoking the fantastic and the brutal all at once. Any comics fan will be reminded of the immortal ""Death Of Gwen Stacy"" storyline during the chilling,final confrontation between hero and villain.New York becomes a character in its own right. Watching the film,you really get the impression that Spidey owns the Big Apple.The city is like an old,familiar friend to him as he effortlessly swings from rooftop to rooftop,looking for vermin that would soil or irritate NYC and the good people who live there(the scene where all of the citizens start pelting the Goblin with debris and such almost brought a tear to my eye). ""Spider-Man"" is as much a tribute to New York and its residents as well as the comic book form and Spidey himself.I had been pulling for Freddie Prinze Jr. to get the role as Peter Parker,but Tobey Maguire's performance made me forget about all of that. Maguire evokes Parker's quiet,shy,sensitive personality perhaps better than any other actor out there and balances it masterfully with cocky,devil-may-care attitude of Parker's alter ego. Now, I can't imagine anyone else playing Parker other than Maguire.The same can be said for Dunst's Mary Jane Watson. I originally thought that she would have made a better Gwen Stacy(Parker's first true love in the comics). After seeing her as Watson,I became convinced that she was the correct choice. Dunst really tapped into the fun-loving,starry-eyed yet troubled working-class girl that MJ has always been. MJ's a flirt and a dreamer,and Dunst made her come to life(I wish she would have said the line ""Face it tiger,you just hit the jackpot!"" like she did in the comics,but oh well).I jumped for joy when Willem Defoe was pegged to play the Green Goblin,and Defoe doesn't disappoint. I was hoping that the filmmakers would build the costume and mask around Defoe's chisled visage(just look at that face,he is the Goblin! I love it!),however they opt for a ""body-armor"" look that works pretty well in its own right. Defoe's portrayal of Norman Osborne's madness is frightening. Defoe didn't turn the Goblin into a buffoon like others would have. Defoe's Goblin is deadly,swift,and truly an alter-ego. Defoe makes you believe that Osborne and the Goblin are two separate people inhabiting one mind. The Goblin mask speaks to Osborne,and Osbourne speaks back to it. He makes Osborne seem sympathetic,and in a way,almost tragic in the tradition of the great Marvel comics villains.Under different circumstances,Parker and the senior Osborne could have been like father and son,and Defoe as well as Maguire show that through their stellar performances.All of the other performances are great too. From James Franco's Harry Osborne(poor,little rich kid),to J.K. Simmons' J.Jonah Jameson(I wanted to see Dabney Coleman play him,but Simmons fleshes him out well),and even Randy Savage as Bonesaw McGraw(The Macho Man is jakked in this one!). Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben is as loving as the comics character was,and Rosemary Harris turns Aunt May into the grandmother we all had or wish we had.My beefs about this picture are minor. The score was totally wrong for this one. Danny Elfman sounds like he was doing another Batman film by mistake. There is nothing quirky about ""Spider-Man"",and the music should have reflected this. Spider-Man was to me the first ""rock 'n' roll"" superhero. Think about it,he defies authority,debuted in the early 60's(a turbulent time in American history),gets chased by cops,is misunderstood by elders,is full of bravado,is a smart-aleck,and is loved by the people. I wanted to hear electric guitars instead of a bouncy,pretentious orchestra. ""Spider-Man"" is set in New York,not a fictional city like Gotham where Elfman's music fit in better.The Green Goblin's costume also takes some getting used to. Like I said before,I wished they would have taken advantage of Defoe's face(oh that face gives ya the willies,no pun intended). I would have rather seen a form-fitting mask,rather than the bulky helmet the Goblin is given here.I have always loved heroes and heroism,fictional and otherwise. ""Spider-Man"" only reinforced that adoration. Spider-Man is our folk hero,an American myth,our everyman,and I think is in everyone of us. Peter Parker is the kid who we think is geeky,but is cooler than we will ever know. Spider-Man is the mousy librarian who plays in a heavy metal band by night,the housekeeper with a bestselling novel in her head,the accountant who dreams of being a director,hell,the construction worker who dresses in drag and sings Ethel Merman tunes while off-duty. Spider-Man is rock 'n' roll,romance,youth,daring,creativity,and anything anyone ever wanted to be when they grow up. The movie made this all clear.I hate to admit it,but I'm finding myself getting as choked up writing this review as I did while watching the conclusion of the film when I realized that they actually succeeded in making my favorite hero of all time come to life in masterful fashion.Watching the movie made me take a look into myself and realize more than ever that I too am Peter Parker and Spider-Man or at least wish I was.""Spider-Man"" is a sometimes harrowing,but ultimately wonderful film. Everyone will find something to enjoy in it. The action fans will rejoice when the battles take place,the romantics will fall head over heels with the love triangle,and those who just plain like a good flick will come away wanting to cruise the skyline of their hometown via webstrands.I want to personally thank all who were involved in the making of this picture. ""We""(meaning comics fans) really needed this movie to be excellent. Not only did you all deliver,but you all seemed to have the time of your lives while you were at it.I want to see a franchise. I want to see Jack Black as Dr. Octopus,Henry Rollins as Venom,Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kraven The Hunter,Kevin Spacey as Electro,Ben Kingsley as the Vulture,Portia de Rossi as the Black Cat,Ed Harris as the Scorpion,and I could go on and on.Go out and see this movie.",5,Someone Finally Does Justice To A Marvel Character On Screen,1024185600,"06 16, 2002",2002,7880,"['was', 'afraid', 'see',

585403,A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,B00005JKCH,The Groove,"[2, 2]","""Spider-Man"" is the best movie based on a comic book hero since 1978's ""Superman - the Movie.""  That's not to knock the first two ""Batman"" flicks, but Sam Raimi's film based on the school geek turned crimefighter packs a greater punch of thrills and magic unlike anything I've seen in a while.  Also, like ""Superman,"" ""Spider-Man"" has a charming innocence that can make even grown adults believe in superheroes.  Tobey Maguire has a reputation for bringing to life offbeat nerds, whether the films are ""Wonder Boys"" or ""Cider House Rules.""  But here, Maguire hits the bullseye as Peter Parker, the brainy student who has the hots for the girl next door (Kirsten Dunst).  When Parker gets accidentally bitten by a spider, his body changes and he learns of his true calling.  But every hero has his nemesis, and in this film, Spider-Man's sworn enemy is the nasty Green Goblin, played to the hilt by Willem Defoe.  Raimi does what many other directors fail to do: make a compelling summer movie that doesn't reek of corporate stench.  The special effects are cool, but they take a backseat to the storyline and the cast which make up ""Spider-Man's"" greatest strengths.  On its own merits, this film really earns four stars, but the loaded quality features force me to give it an extra star.

The images are great, so is the soudtrack. However, I found the actors and the dialogues very unconvincing in several scenes (one of the dialogues between Peter and MJ is really dumb). That is not too serious though, because this movie is essentially an action movie, and there are plenty of excellent action scenes ; all the fights between Osborn and Peter-Spiderman are fabulous, especially the attack on the Roosevelt Island cable car. One of the interesting points of the story is the fact that many people wandered if Spiderman was doing good or evil, in spite of all his good actions... even the Police was against him in an incredible -but real- scene. Also interesting is the scene near the end when Osborn realizes that he is losing, he starts to lie to confuse Peter's mind (he tells him that he never wanted to harm him or MJ etc.).

585407,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B00005JKCH,Thomas Glebe,"[1, 1]","I have mostly been disappointed by ""super hero"" feature film attempts.  The first ""Superman"" movie was cool, as was the first ""Batman"" flick, but both still had problems.  As a Spiderman fan (okay, I guess I'm a bit biased), since a kid, I was wondering if they could do justice to this, probably the most truly interesting and unique superhero comic character ever created.  They did it!  And best, they did it right!  This is a great movie and works excellently on almost all levels.I have never been so surprised and taken aback by such a well done movie since I saw The Matrix for the first time, and Fight Club. I haven't seen a Spiderman ""comic book"" for a decade or so, and though I couldn't help to hear some pretty positive feedback on this film, before I actually finally watched it (on cable), I wondered.  Would they really get Spiderman ""right?""  Truly though, this exceeded all my expectations.I have read other reviews which complain about too much obvious CGI and a ""video game"" feel overall to most of the action scenes but hey, I see nothing wrong with any of that.  First, what's wrong with video games anyway?  Some can be quite entertaining, and some can contain excellent special effects and storylines.  This has both, and second, no ""controller"" is needed.  Just sit back and relax and enjoy.  Anyway, how the heck DOES one translate a colorful costumed superhero swinging from skyscrapers and bridges and such, without almost ""video-game"" effects?  If anything, I was and am astounded at the effects, and how they translated ink and paper into 24 frames per second, and almost flawlessly.Tobey Maguire is and was flawless casting.  He brings the down to earth, nerdish-ness of Peter Parker, transformed in heroic times into a web slinging crime fighter, to the big screen perfectly.  Kirsten Dunst, is okay, but imo, played just a bit too sexy and very UN-girl next door from the character I remember from long ago, but I guess we're in new times and a new millenium.  It was also nice to see Cliff Robertson, semi-blacklisted for a time in Hollyweird, get a nice part here, that of Peter's uncle Ben, Parker's ""father"" he never had.There are two distinct stories here, one of Peter Parker's life, and then the special effects blockbuster scenes.  Both mix well throughout, and I never got bored at all, even by the slower, quieter, dramatic scenes.  In fact, there's really not a dull moment here, and it's obvious equal attention was given to the non fx parts of the movie just as much as the eye-popping and exciting action parts.Even non-fans of this general genre will find a LOT to love here.  If the thought that a movie called ""Spiderman"" based upon a comic book turns you off immediately to even giving this one viewing, you're really missing something special.  If you're expecting a heavy-handed, ""dark"" type of ""Batman"" experience here, you won't find it.  If you're expecting an over-the-top and almost self mocking comics/movie translation ala Superman, look elsewhere.However, if you're looking for a great story, plot, acting, and amazing special effects, if you're looking for 2 hours of pure amazing entertainment, this film version of the AMAZING Spiderman is hard to beat.

This film had everything i look for in a movie granted i am probably not the best film critic around but i look for the simple things in a movie and this delivered well above my expectations. i want a movie that has good special effect's but not overdone one that actually has a good story or one in spidermans case that sticks to the story of the comic book as close as possible and spiderman does this quite well. And if your a big spider-man fan i don't think you will be disapointed at all with this film. As for actors and actresses WOW nice to see hollywood put it's trust in a differen't group of actors than you would normally see for a film of this nature and does it deliver. Toby Maguire is an excellent spider-man and one i think kids who will watch this film can relate to. He does an outstanding job as peter parker and spider-man. Kirsten Dunst who said this lady could not be Mary Jane she sizzled I for one thought she did an outstanding job as spider-man's love intrest. And who can forget the green goblin played by Willem Dafoe i must say they have the perfect cast for this picture. I want to also add that Sam Raimi is the director for this picture i had actually never heard of him before this picture but i really do feel after seeing this film you will be hearing alot about this man what a director WOW. Hey sam please don't change any of the cast for part 2 the talent here is fantastic.

585409,A1ZXN0UA0ZN21I,B00005JKCH,Thomas R MaCoy,"[1, 1]","Very rarely has a movie given me such a feeling of anticipation as Spider-Man, and I don't even read the comics. This said, it follows that this review should be fairly unbiased and good for the majority of people who don't spend days studying the brightly colored panels and speech balloons. (No offense to one of my good friends who does, or anyone else of that nature.) And that said, this follows: the movie was most thoroughly excellent. That's all there is. I'm not going to run down the plot; by now, you should know it, and if you don't, go see it and find out. Acting? Good. Quite good. Toby Maguire, except for a couple bad lines, falls into the character perfectly, and all the other actors hold up well. The exception is Willem Dafoe, who goes above and beyond the rest. He gets the play the insane bad guy, the Green Goblin, and he does the role with flamboyance, humor, and a perfect touch of drama. Storyline? Excellent. As said, I don't read the comics, so I can't make a comparison. What I can say is Spider-Man's story is focused totally on the characters rather then a wild destroy-the-world plot, and it makes for a much stronger movie. The greatest asset is the interplay between them: Peter Parker and his best friend are in love with the same girl, the best friend's father sees Peter as more of a son then his own son, Peter and the father are friends on the surface and their alter-egos are enemies; it's intricate but stops at the perfect point before ""bad soap opera"". More so, the ending was very strong; it's not quite what you expect, and it manages to add both a good sense of closure and an opening for a sequel. The action? Ignore that elitist fool Ebert's review. He complains the action scenes lack presence and look fake. I reply they are frequent, fast-paced, exciting, and absolutely perfect for a movie like this. Few things beat webslinging around the streets of NY for coolness. It is here, however, that my one tiny complaint arises. In the moments where Spider-Man goes mano a mano with Green Goblin, there is only one time when the blows are going back and forth; the rest is of one beating the other up. Now this still looks very cool, but the fighting between them could have been done a little better. The action scenes also feel a little short. Fortunately this is made up by them being fairly frequent and looking incredibly cool. The camera work is used to maximum effectiveness, racing after the masked man has he zips around the streets, slowing down during explosions, and generally adding to the limitless energy contained in the movie. Special effects look just right. Spider-Man is great beating up four bad guys at once; he can jump and flip circles around them, and unlike say, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (I would love for Ebert to read this) it look real, as though he is strong enough to leap that high, and it does not look like he has two or three wires linked to a hidden belt. Watching him swing through the streets takes the feeling ""How cool would that be"" to new levels. The movie also adds a touch of humor at just the right points, and a touch of drama at just the right others. And watching Peter evolve from a social outcast to a kid with a new toy to a new type of social outcast, one with responsibilities he cannot share, adds a very human depth to the film. Spider-Man is a great movie, mixing action and drama in just the right levels.

585413,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B00005JKCH,T O'Brien,"[2, 2]","Spider-Man is a great action movie based on the comic book that has an excellent story to back up the action.  Peter Parker is your average high school student until one day on a field trip to a museum, he is bit by a genetically enhanced spider.  After being bitten, he begins to notice things have changed since he is now toned and does not need to wear glasses anymore.  Peter then discovers that he can shoot webs from his wrist.  Soon enough, Peter has morphed into Spider-Man as he begins to battle crime in New York City.  Along the way, he must battle Green Goblin who begins terrorizing the city.  At the same time, he must try and live his life while also concealing his identity.  This was a great superhero action movie with great fight scenes, especially the showdown between Spidey and the Green Goblin.  What makes this movie better than your average action movie is the story.  You get to know the characters rather than just seeing them as comic book stereotypes.  Highly recommended viewing.Spider-Man has an excellent cast whom all give excellent performances.  Tobey Maguire stars in the title role as Spiderman/Peter Parker.  The transformation he makes on screen from high school student to superhero is fully believable.  Willem Dafoe is great as Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, who is torn between himself and his evil alter-ego.  Kirsten Dunst is perfect as all-American girl, Mary Jane Watson, Peter's secret crush.  In a very good supporting role, James Franco plays Peter's friend Harry.  The movie also stars Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  Also look out for Spider-Man creator Stan Lee in a scene where the Green Goblin attacks the city.  Rather than go through all of the extras on the 2-Disc DVD, I'll just say that if you enjoyed the movie you will love the huge range of extras offered on the DVD.

It has a simple yet very effective storyline that draws the viewer in from the beginning. Young Peter Parker is a guy with a crush, but must suppress that temptation as his new powers become apparent. He instead embarks on a commitment of being a public servant. Woven into the story is the perfect villain (Green Goblin) who turns out to be Peter's best friend's father. If you like crime-busting action at its best, then this movie is for you. If you like a little romance sprinkled in, then this movie is for you. This movie also fully captures the essence of city life, and how a character like Spiderman can bring about a mysteriousness in the eyes of skeptical people as well as those who believe in what he's doing. This movie exemplifies the division between good and evil; Parker as Spiderman must win the hearts and minds of his people while trying to bring down Green Goblin.

It has since been surpassed by three films, one of which is its outstanding sequel, ""Spider-Man 2"".  ""Spider-Man"" is still amongst the very best superhero movies, though, behind ""X-Men"" and in front of ""Superman"".Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker, a nerdy high school student who undergoes a series of unusual changes after being bitten by a new species of spider.  Parker eventually becomes web-slinging superhero Spider-Man, in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  Unfortunately for Peter, Mary Jane is dating Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose father (Willem Dafoe) is the latest threat to New York City.Sam Raimi, who previously had directed only cult films (most of which were excellent), proves that he is more than capable of directing big-budget pictures.  He does a great job of focusing on the adventure of the Spider-Man legend, as well as Peter Parker's impossible romance with Mary Jane and his need for secrecy.The cast is very good.  Tobey Maguire was a perfect choice for Peter Parker, making him a very likable character, as well as one that we can feel for.  Willem Dafoe is enjoyably over-the-top as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, while J.K. Simmons is perfectly cast as J. Jonah Jameson.  ""Evil Dead"" fans: Bruce Campbell is the announcer at the wrestling match.David Koepp's script remains faithful to the comics on which it's based, while never being too cheesy or unbelievable.

585424,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JKCH,trebe,"[0, 0]","For its time, Spider-Man (2002) is an impressive technical achievement, as well as an entertaining, straight ahead action film.  Director Sam Raimi's interpretation of the vanguard of Marvel Comics, while a pretty good thrill ride, is open to much discussion, as he reconfigures the Spider-Man universe.Spider-Man was created by Stan Lee and Steve Dikto, back in 1963, and has become an icon among comic book superheroes.  In 1967, Spider-Man appeared in an animated series, that captured much of the basic essence of the character, and helped to boost his popularity.  The short lived 1978 TV series, demonstrated that realistically translating the character to live action, would be a major technical challenge.  It would not be until after another twenty years had passed, that technology would advance far enough to make bringing the webslinger to the big screen possible.With nearly forty years of history behind Spider-Man, the challenge was to decide what to focus on, and how to present the characters.  While the screenplay gets some things right, there are other matters that do not play as well, as Spidey's life story gets a major makeover.  The film takes the traditional route, starting at the beginning, with a retelling of the origin of the character, and after setting the stage, Act II focuses on Spider-Man's battle with the Green Goblin.Casting was a crucial process, and after appearing as Spider-Man in three films, I have mixed feelings about Toby Maguire.  Not so much with his performance as Spider-Man, but mostly as Peter Parker.  His voice sounds too boyish, and his portrayal does not match my conception of the character.  The writing is a major contributor to this, as Maguire's Parker comes off as more of a shy, clumsy, lovesick goof, rather than as teen struggling with coming to terms with being a superhero.  The angst and inner conflict that Parker had in the early days (the first 100 issues of The Amazing Spider-Man), as well as Spidey's irreverent sense of humor, is completely missing.  As is having to deal with financial troubles, and Aunt May's health concerns.  While going in that direction might have dragged down the movie, even a critical element like Peter's relationship with Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), is glossed over.In the 1960's era comics, Mary Jane was an outgoing swinger type, and bears little resemblance to the confusingly written 'good girl' character we have here.  Peter is her neighbor for 12 years, yet she hardly knows him, and then he suddenly becomes her soulmate?  Kirsten Dunst does a good job with the role as written.  The issue is not with her performance, but again like Maguire, with the writing.  Peter's love interest in the early comics was Betty Brandt, followed by Gwen Stacy.  However, involving those characters would have probably been too complicated, particularly as the focus in the film is on Parker's high school life.  Peter is made to appear to be afraid of girls, but in the comics he was more preoccupied with other matters, and regarded as a 'square', rather than being afraid.  While the rationale for some of these decisions is understandable, the mixed up timeline, and the jumble of partial truths with fiction, can be hard for aficionados of the older comics to accept.Listening to the comments by Raimi, John Dykstra, and others, it often sounds like they are selling a bill of goods.  Repeatedly we hear things like Norman Osborn is like Peter's 'surrogate father', and that he favors Peter over his own son.  Osborn offers to help Peter as Harry's roommate, but actually does nothing for him on a personal level.  Willem Dafoe is an exceptional choice for the Osborn/Green Goblin role, but the Goblin's costume is ridiculous joke, looking like a shiny vinyl lizard that is hard to look at without laughing.  It's too bad, because the Goblin maneuvers very well on his glider, and his pumpkin bombs are extremely stylish.  When the Goblin knocks Spidey unconscious, in what universe is it possible, that while helpless, the Goblin didn't take the opportunity to peek under his mask?  Wouldn't you?Unlike the Goblin, Spider-Man's costume looks fabulous, although it is apparently not very durable, and the mask seems very prone to damage.  Later in Spider-Man 2, the mask comes off so often as to be completely ridiculous.  The special effects do a good job of recreating the kind of radical movements Spidey is capable of.  He is almost flying across the skyline of New York.  Peter's ability to create his own webbing, versus man made web shooters, is more in line with the DNA angle to his origin, and simplifies things for the filmmakers.Revealing some of the deficiencies of Spider-Man, is the sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004), which is a much better film, particularly from a technical standpoint, where both Spidey and Dr. Octopus, do some amazing things.  Unfortunately all three Spider-Man films, display an unfortunate pattern regarding the mortality of super-villains.Sam Raimi definitely deserves a lot of credit for what he has achieved with the Spider-Man franchise.  The films are spectacular, and very entertaining, and have forever lifted him from the ranks of cult horror films.  With a history so long and rich, there will be issues regarding Spider-Man, no matter what road is taken.  Raimi seems to have carte blanche regarding the character, and the films are rewriting Spider-Man's history in quite significant ways.  It is apparent that the PG-13 films, are targeted squarely at a young audience, who have different tastes, and may have never read a Spider-Man comic.  The decisions made here were crucial, as they established the framework for the films that follow, and will become 'reality' for those who have no other frame of reference.Raimi had great power in deciding what to do, but did he live up to the responsibility of doing justice to Spider-Man?  In the end, while the film successfully delivers Spider-Man, it falls very much short in depicting the lives of the real life characters.",4,power and responsibility . . .

The first show that started 9:10 a.m. was not a very happy experience for me, but it's good to see Sam Raimi regain his flair for rousing actions that has been laid aside since the 1990 ""Darkman.""  And looking back from now, it was very fortunate that Cameron didn't take the helm of the production for the hero-image of ""Spider-man"" is more unconventional than all-American one, which Leo or Arnie might have been struggling to handle.  No way.Anyone with some knowledge about comics or TV should have been already seen this wonder boy Tobey Maguire who gains his incredible power of hanging from walls and buildings.  Unlike other superheroes, however, ""Spider-man"" emphasizes on his personality as an ordinary boy, who thinks of his extraordinary spider-like ability as a curse.  And I bet you do, even if you got a kiss from Mary Jane in the form of Kristen Dunst while you're hanging from up above, showing only your lips!Yes, Sam Raimi shows again his deft skill at mixing those incongruous elements -- darkness behind heroism and romance between a boy and a girl -- and he even throws unexpected comical moments into this hero's adventure, making his Peter ""Spider-man"" Parker's character more human than you expect.  There's no machismo, no obligatory love scene.  But that's what Raimi's style all about, which curiously matches this unusual hero from Marvel Comic.So, don't try to find something similar to ""Superman"" here (though you get some funny allusions to this popular hero; watch how Tobey discloses his costume baring his breast on the street, the same way Christopher Reeve once did in the first ""Superman"" film.); the touch of the film is completely different, and though the film itself never forgets to entertain us with its exciting high-speed action sequences, the strength lies in its slightly off-beat presentation of this hero's life in America, and especially New York City.  I was greatly amuzed to see the city depicted from a new perspective, that is of course, from high up above the city.Supporting cast is also very good, and my special mention goes to ever-getting gorgeous Kirsten Dunst, whose eccentric beauty goes along well hand in hand with Tobey Maguire's oddly amusing, droll superhero image.  And it is only natural that Ms. Dunst's past filmography helps greatly -- you know, she was in ""Interview with the Vampire"" (she was a child vampire) and ""The Crow -- Salvation"" (wow ... with another dark hero).Though it doesn't have the groundbreaking special effects that impressed us in, say,  ""Matrix,""  ""Spider-man"" is a great achievement after all, which can be done only by first-rate crew and cast, and this case again, kudos to Mr. Raimi, to whom I really want to say: Welcome back, Sam, and please, please,  don't make any more baseball film.",5,"No, That's Spider-man!

It has something for everyone in the family: some action, cool effects, a little romance, and even a couple of moral messages. Most people are at least familiar with the origins of Spider-man and since that's a large part of the movie's plot, it isn't worth discussing here. The movie stays fairly true to those origins. Granted a few minor adjustments have been made to make the movie flow better in it's modern setting, but those differences aren't worth quibbling.There are only a two flaws I could see with the movie. To begin with, the action sequences weren't long enough especially the climatic battle at the end. The movie would have flowed a little faster with some more action. The other flaw is that Tobey Maguire and Kristen Dunst just didn't have any chemistry between them. It appears as though their characters were acting like they were attracted to each other instead of appearing as though their characters were in love.Sam Raimi has been a Spider-man fan for years and his passion for the comics is what lead to his being hired to direct SPIDER-MAN. He hasn't let anyone down. Other than ARMY OF DARKNESS, SPIDER-MAN is probably his best movie yet.The acting is extraordinary for a comic book movie and Tobey Maguire is right on the money as Peter Parker. Kristen Dunst is a great Mary Jane Watson, except when she and Maguire share romantic scenes. I was also impressed by the actor who played Harry Osborne, his portrayal was superb.Overall a great movie that the entire family will probably enjoy.

Not only does it treat an american pop-culture icon with the respect that it deserves, it is one of the most well balanced action-adventure movies to come out in a long time.This is what happens when a fan gets a hold of the material and does it right. Sure there is action, but an action flick is just flash and explosion without strong characters behind it. Sam Raimi is the perfect choice for the film. His Hitchcock like style and tongue-in-cheek humor lends itself well to Spider-Man. He has never been conventional, and he doesent disappoint here either.Tobey MacGuire is also an ideal choice as Peter Parker, Spider-Mans alter ego. The movie never lets you forget that there is a awkward teenager underneath that suit, and in order to pull that off, you need a decent actor. Yes there could have been others but I shiver to think what would happen if Freddie Prinze Jr. got the role.Willem Defoe was also aptly cast as Norman Osbourne a.k.a. The Green Goblin. But it also brings me to the only real issue I had with the film. His costume and I am being very picky. I loved Defoe's performance and see the reasoning why that the way that they did, but I was hoping for something a little bit more organic and less high-tech.Kirsten Dunst also does a good job as Mary Jane Watson, Peter Parkers love interest and I was surprised at the depth and maturity that went into the performance.But the show stealers are Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and J.K. Simmons and J. Jonah Jamison. Even the most skeptic Marvel die hards will agree that these two knocked out of the park. No matter how many times I have watched this, I always am amazed by them.The DVD is very impressive. The favorite feature of mine is the pop up option for the movie. It's the same as ""VH1's Pop-Up Videos"" just done with a feature film. Very informative and funny. The is also a commentary which is okay and you can also choose to have a spider icon option than, when it shows on the lower right of the screen, you press enter and a behind the scenes vignette shows up. Very similar to ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""X-Men 1.5."" The difference being, while still distracting, these vignettes are actuall interesting to watch. There are two music videos, concept art, and an interview with Spider-Man creator Stan Lee. Not to mention a really cool short featuring Todd MacFarlane and John Romita Jr. Two legendary Spider-man artists. My wife, who is not a comics fan, was surprised how much she liked the bonus material.

Unfortunately, I had to find work quickly to support my young family and took up a job selling insurance, but in my spare time I set up a molecular genetics and biochemistry lab in my garage.Thinking back on my youthful fantasies, I created a mutated strain of spider having all the abilities mentioned in the movie. I then infected the spider with a virus that incorporated the spider's genome into the virus's own DNA.Much like in the movie, I allowed the spider to bite me and inject the virus into my bloodstream, and also paralleling the movie, I felt woozy and collapsed to the floor. When I woke up later the next morning, I looked in the mirror with high hopes, but found my vision was distorted. On closer inspection, I realized that my vision was distorted because I had grown six extra eyelets, like a real spider. At first, I was horrified, but then I gradually came to accept the change as the price of greatness. But that was not the end to the transformations.I too, can spin a web, but it doesn't shoot out of my wrists. Instead, like a real spider, my spinnerets are located in my anus, so I have to pull down my pants every time I want to create a web.I also have a deep craving for the blood of insects, and my family has left me because my favorite food are live flies I catch with my web.  I eat them as a real spider would, by injecting my venom and digestive enzymes into their bodies to liquefy their innards and then sucking out the deliciously bitter and creamy soup.Anyway, I wanted to warn all you spidey-fans out there who are thinking of allowing yourselves to be bitten by genetically-modified super spiders that you may get more than you bargain for. I no longer resemble anything human, and soon I will need to banish myself from human society for the sake of all that is good and holy.

Hollywood did something right for once and Sam Raimi was the director to do it.Tobey Macguire is perfect as Peter Parker.  A bright but somewhat shy and insecure orphaned teenager being raised by his aunt and uncle.  In fact it's doubtful anyone could have played the role better than he.  The action scenes are well done but the movie is at it's best while it shows Parker coming to grips with his powers while at the same time coming to grips with being a teen.  Raimi stays true to the original Marvel storyline with great effect.William Defoe is very good as the Green Goblin.  Some have claimed his role is less than stellar but I disagree.  In typical Marvel fashion even the bad guys has some humanity as in the last scene featuring the Green Goblin (I won't give it away).The absolute best supporting role is that of the newspaper editor played by J.K. Simmons.  If Macguire's own role wasn't so well done he might have stole the show.

A lot of the critics liked it and don't get me wrong, I like it too.  I was just expecting a darker version of the story.  Willem Dafoe is just loony, and Green Goblin should not be played like the Joker or the Riddler.  The casting there was iffy, but everything else was on par.  An enjoyable Saturday night rental is the best I can give the movie.The DVD - Well, first things first, the video and the sound are top notch.  I won't knock it on the A/V quality.  The picture has a 3d look to it and it's very vibrant and the soundfield comes alive in many places of the movie.  However, the extras are lacking.

Screenwriter David Koepp (who worked on Jurassic Park among many another films) does a marvelous job of fleshing out Stan Lee's and Steve Ditko's characters. What is most impressive is how the mythology is incorporated into an action story. Most film directors would have spend half the time dealing with Peter Parker's transformation or origin. Instead, we get it all reduced to the first 20 minutes and Spidey actually gets introduced within the first hour. We also see many of Spidey's exploits through a montage.The direction by comic devotee Sam Raimi fits in perfectly with the character and story--which is no surprise given Raimi's comic book visual style (see Darkman, Army of Darkness or any of the other Evil Dead movies for a demonstration of his ""panel"" visual style). The direction is also informed with a love of comics which radiates throughout the picture creating much of the power of the film. Credit also goes to Raimi for not trying to ""mainstream"" Spidey and make him respectable. He doesn't pander to highbrow critics by making this into something more than a spectacular adventure film. Although it lacks the impressive backstory of X-Men (the motivation for Magneto is established very clearly in the film version and it has resonance beyond comics), Raimi more than makes up for it with a stunning series of visual set pieces.The visual effects with the CGI Spidey are pretty impressive. Their not 100% convincing as of yet but are pretty darn close. You do believe (for the most part) that a man can climb a wall. John Dykstra's (Star Wars, Star Trek: TMP) visuals are fluid and well integrated into the action. There are some sequences where it's difficult to distinguish CGI from the real actors. An example is the scene where Parker tracks down Uncle Ben's killer in as the ""Human Spider"". Most of the sequence is CGI with Tobey Maguire's eyes the only real thing in the shot.Willem Dafoe crackles and cackles as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. I was afraid that he might overpower Maguire (a la Jack Nickolson's Joker from Batman). He doesn't. He plays the dual role with enough conviction and with a touch of madness where we can almost feel sympathetic for Osborn. The rest of the cast including Kristin Dunst as MJ are credible and seamlessly weave themselves into the fabric of the story.I actually would give Spiderman 4 1/2 stars as there were some areas of improvement in the visuals (the CGI Spidey). I also felt that the characters were well developed (J. K. Simmons as J.Jonah Jamieson is a hoot--exactly as I would have imagined him). I felt that killing Gobie was premature (although it does set up Harry Osborn's hate of Spidey and the potential for him to don his father's outfit in a sequel)but the sequence works.The extras are just icing on the cake. The screentests for Maguire (a great action sequence similar to the one where MJ is attacked by goons in the film)and Simmons reading Jameison's lines)are great. The gag reel/outtakes are a chuckle (particularly Willem Dafoe's scenes where he proves how over the top he could have been as Gobie). I would have loved to see more of the CGI screen tests (including earlier tests) but the single example included here is impressive. It's easy to see why the film got the greenlight given all of this.I don't think James Cameron (who had wanted to direct Spidey) could have done this film any better. In fact, I personally feel based on Darkman that Raimi was the only director really up to the task of directing Spiderman. Hopefully he can keep the quality high for the second film (Parker was fired by Dr. Morgan who later turns into a villan in Spiderman so that could be the set up for # 2). I have the feeling that Columbia/Tristar will be releasing a Ultimate Spiderman boxed set with more material later down the line but, unless you're a completist, this all the Spidey that you'll need. Definitely one of the top 10 films of the year.",5,"""You're not Superman you know""",1036195200,"11 2, 2002",2002,4311,"['Well', 'actually', 'better', 'Superman', 'should', 'say', 'movie', 'Superman', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'adaption', 'minor', 'flaws', 'X', 'Men', 'Spiderman', 'came', 'have', 'also', 'give', 'credit', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'Blade', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'adaptions', 'Spiderman', 'recapture', 'wonder', 'remember', 'reading', 'comic', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Screenwriter', 'David', 'Koepp', 'who', 'worked', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'many', 'films', 'marvelous', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'characters', 'What', 'most', 'impressive', 'how', 'mythology', 'incorporated', 'action', 'story', 'Most', 'film', 'directors', 'would', 'have', 'spend', 'time', 'dealing', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'transformation', 'origin', 'Instead', 'get', 'reduced', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'Spidey', 'actually', 'introduced', 'first', 'hour', 'also', 'see', 'many', 'Spidey', 'exploits', 'montage.The', 'direction', 'comic', 'devotee', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'perfectly', 'character', 'story', 'surprise', 'given', 'Raimi', 'comic', 'book', 'visual', 'style', 'see', 'Darkman', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'other', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'movies', 'demonstration', 'panel', 'visual', 'style', 'direction', 'also', 'informed', 'love', 'comics', 'picture', 'creating', 'much', 'power', 'film', 'Credit', 'also', 'Raimi', 'not', 'trying', 'mainstream', 'Spidey', 'make', 'respectable', ""n't"", 'pander', 'highbrow', 'critics', 'making', 'something', 'more', 'spectacular', 'adventure', 'film', 'impressive', 'backstory', 'X-Men', 'motivation', 'Magneto', 'established', 'very', 'clearly', 'film', 'version', 'resonance', 'comics', 'Raimi', 'more', 'up', 'stunning', 'series', 'visual', 'set', 'pieces.The', 'visual', 'effects', 'CGI', 'Spidey', 'are', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'not', '100', '%', 'convincing', 'yet', 'are', 'pretty', 'darn', 'close', 'do', 'believe', 'most', 'part', 'man', 'can', 'climb', 'wall', 'John', 'Dykstra', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TMP', 'visuals', 'are', 'fluid', 'well', 'integrated', 'action', 'are', 'sequences', 'where', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'CGI', 'real', 'actors', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Parker', 'down', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'killer', 'Human', 'Spider', 'Most', 'sequence', 'CGI', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'eyes', 'only', 'real', 'thing', 'shot.Willem', 'Dafoe', 'crackles', 'cackles', 'Norman', 'Osborn/The', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'was', 'afraid', 'might', 'overpower', 'Maguire', 'la', 'Jack', 'Nickolson', 'Joker', 'Batman', ""n't"", 'dual', 'role', 'enough', 'conviction', 'touch', 'madness', 'where', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'Osborn', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Kristin', 'Dunst', 'MJ', 'are', 'credible', 'seamlessly', 'weave', 'fabric', 'story.I', 'actually', 'would', 'give', 'Spiderman', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'were', 'areas', 'improvement', 'visuals', 'CGI', 'Spidey', 'also', 'felt', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'developed', 'J.', 'K.', 'Simmons', 'J.Jonah', 'Jamieson', 'hoot', 'exactly', 'would', 'have', 'imagined', 'felt', 'killing', 'Gobie', 'was', 'premature', 'set', 'up', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'hate', 'Spidey', 'potential', 'don', 'father', 'outfit', 'sequel', 'sequence', 'works.The', 'extras', 'are', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'screentests', 'Maguire', 'great', 'action', 'sequence', 'similar', 'one', 'where', 'MJ', 'attacked', 'goons', 'film', 'Simmons', 'reading', 'Jameison', 'lines', 'are', 'great', 'gag', 'reel/outtakes', 'are', 'chuckle', 'particularly', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'scenes', 'where', 'how', 'top', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Gobie', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'CGI', 'screen', 'tests', 'including', 'earlier', 'tests', 'single', 'example', 'included', 'here', 'impressive', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'got', 'greenlight', 'given', 'this.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'James', 'Cameron', 'who', 'had', 'wanted', 'direct', 'Spidey', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'film', 'better', 'fact', 'personally', 'feel', 'based', 'Darkman', 'Raimi', 'was', 'only', 'director', 'really', 'up', 'task', 'directing', 'Spiderman', 'Hopefully', 'can', 'keep', 'quality', 'high', 'second', 'film', 'Parker', 'was', 'fired', 'Dr.', 'Morgan', 'who', 'later', 'villan', 'Spiderman', 'could', 'be', 'set', 'up', '2', 'have', 'feeling', 'Columbia/Tristar', 'will', 'be', 'releasing', 'Ultimate', 'Spiderman', 'boxed', 'set', 'more', 'material', 'later', 'line', ""'re"", 'completist', 'Spidey', ""'ll"", 'need', 'Definitely', 'one', 'top', '10', 'films', 'year']",N/A

However, for a comic-book superhero movie, ""Spiderman"" acquits itself quite well.  In a smart casting move, the movie stars the legitimately geeky-looking Tobey Maguire in the title role as Peter Parker, the high-school nerd who gains superhuman powers from a spiderbite.  Willem Dafoe ably mans the villain role as Norman ""The Green Goblin"" Osborn, and as Peter's love object Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst is, well, hot.This movie is a far cry from the old-fashioned superhero movies, typified by the ""Superman"" of twenty-five years ago, where a hero perfect in body and soul takes out one-dimensional villains with no moral conflict.  Befitting these more complex times, ""Spiderman"" presents a more complex version of the superhero, a young man with special powers who has to make the difficult decisions about how to use them.  Before he's murdered, Peter's uncle Ben tells him ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" and Peter carries that weight with him the rest of the movie.  He has to think about how his superhero role effects those close to him, and his decisions aren't easy.  Likewise, the villainous Green Goblin is literally a two-dimensional character, with a split personality caused by his performance enhancers, and the movie lets us see the conflict between his good and bad sides.As an action movie, ""Spiderman"" is a mixed bag.  The pacing is excellent, with action scenes nicely interspersed into the drama, but the action sequences themselves leave a bit to be desired.  They're pretty well choreographed, but I think they're a bit TOO slickly produced.  Much like in the two ""Star Wars"" prequels, everything's just a bit too glossy and fake-looking.  I found the grittier look of Michael Keaton's ""Batman"" to be far more effective, and I don't really like the direction these special-effects extravaganzas are moving in now.That said, ""Spiderman"" is still a pretty good movie.  It's a lot more intelligent and ambitious than I had expected, and for thatalone it should get at least three stars.  It also has an absolutely terrific ending, not the ""mega-happy"" conclusion I was expecting, so it gets an extra star tacked on.

The only reason I gave both 5 stars is because ""SPIDER-MAN"" is good film not because it's missing things, but because there are things that could have been added to make a great film. Do you see where I'm going with this?Anyways, ""SPIDER-MAN"" is about Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire), he's pretty much the school nerd, he's also an orphan who lives with his aunt and Uncle Ben. One day, he goes on a field trip with a group of other highschool kids to a spider exibit. amongst the group of kids is the most popular and beautiful girl he has met(Kirsten Dunst). She points out that one of the super genetic spiders is missing, but no one is listening as the group progresses. It's that same time, that Peter gathers the nerve to talk to the girl(It's been a month and half, I hardly remember thier names, so bear with me).""For the school paper?"" Peter asks, holding up a camera.""Sure,"" she responds. As he takes the pictures, the missing spider spirals down on his hand and bites down, inserting its super genetic powers into his DNA.After a day or so Peter begins to explore these powers. He knows he could use them on criminals, but at first he chooses not to. Then suddenly, his Uncle Ben is shot and killed and Peter devotes his life to stopping crime as, Spider-Man, but he is taken the wrong way and is thought to be a criminal.Throughout the movie Peter budgets his time as himself and Spider-Man. Soon, the girl forms a relationship with BOTH Spider-Man AND Peter. Also, around the same time, Spider-Man meets his rival, Green Goblin, who really is the father of Peter's best friend. But he doesn't know.Soon it becomes a deadly game of sabotage and The Green Goblin tempts him to fight by putting his aunt in the hospital and taking hostages. Spider-Man only figures out who The Green Goblin is until the last fight.So, overall, ""SPIDER-MAN"" is a good movie at the fullest, but not a great movie. The only other way to explain this is that ""SPIDER-MAN"" is a blockbuster, not an Academy Award-Winner.",5,A GOOD Film.,1023667200,"06 10, 2002",2002,2102,"['want', 'see', 'good', 'film', 'see', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'film', 'see', 'INSOMNIA', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'missing', 'things', 'are', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'Do', 'see', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'Anyways', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'pretty', 'much', 'school', 'nerd', 'also', 'orphan', 'who', 'aunt', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'One', 'day', 'field', 'trip', 'group', 'other', 'highschool', 'kids', 'spider', 'exibit', 'group', 'kids', 'most', 'popular', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'met', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'out', 'one', 'super', 'genetic', 'spiders', 'missing', 'one', 'listening', 'group', 'same', 'time', 'Peter', 'nerve', 'talk', 'girl', 'been', 'month', 'half', 'hardly', 'remember', 'thier', 'names', 'so', 'bear', 'school', 'paper', 'Peter', 'holding', 'up', 'camera', 'Sure', 'pictures', 'missing', 'spider', 'spirals', 'down', 'hand', 'down', 'inserting', 'super', 'genetic', 'powers', 'DNA.After', 'day', 'so', 'Peter', 'explore', 'powers', 'could', 'use', 'criminals', 'first', 'not', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'shot', 'killed', 'Peter', 'life', 'stopping', 'crime', 'Spider-Man', 'taken', 'wrong', 'way', 'thought', 'be', 'criminal.Throughout', 'movie', 'Peter', 'time', 'Spider-Man', 'Soon', 'girl', 'relationship', 'BOTH', 'Spider-Man', 'AND', 'Peter', 'Also', 'same', 'time', 'Spider-Man', 'meets', 'rival', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'who', 'really', 'father', 'Peter', 'best', 'friend', ""n't"", 'know.Soon', 'deadly', 'game', 'sabotage', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'fight', 'putting', 'aunt', 'hospital', 'taking', 'hostages', 'Spider-Man', 'only', 'out', 'who', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'last', 'fight.So', 'overall', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'good', 'movie', 'fullest', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'only', 'other', 'way', 'explain', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'blockbuster', 'not', 'Academy', 'Award-Winner']",N/A
