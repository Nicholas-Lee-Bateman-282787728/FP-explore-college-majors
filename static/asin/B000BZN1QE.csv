954132,AR3BZOTB7IY78,B000BZN1QE,Anton Karidian,"[12, 12]","I have been a big fan of Leonard Nimoy for many years, and this wonderful DVD of his one-man play VINCENT has led me to admire him even more. Nimoy gives a very sincere and dramatic performance, and the story is true since it's all based on letters between Vincent Van Gogh and his brother Theo. The day after I watched the play, I ran it again but this time listening to the commentary track, and was again enthralled as Nimoy told fascinating background stories that showed his dedication to this project. For instance, he noted that many of Van Gogh's paintings have often been reproduced poorly in books, so Nimoy personally re-photographed many of them and offered his photos to museums and book publishers. This example illustrates Nimoy's passion about the art and life of Vincent Van Gogh that shines through in the play. Another bonus on the disc is an enjoyable slide show of Van Gogh's paintings and drawings. As you might guess, I highly recommend this DVD!!",5,Great production and great extras,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,970,"['have', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'many', 'years', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'one-man', 'play', 'VINCENT', 'led', 'admire', 'even', 'more', 'Nimoy', 'very', 'sincere', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'story', 'true', 'based', 'letters', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'brother', 'Theo', 'day', 'watched', 'play', 'ran', 'again', 'time', 'listening', 'commentary', 'track', 'was', 'again', 'enthralled', 'Nimoy', 'told', 'fascinating', 'background', 'stories', 'showed', 'dedication', 'project', 'instance', 'noted', 'many', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'paintings', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'reproduced', 'poorly', 'books', 'so', 'Nimoy', 'personally', 're-photographed', 'many', 'offered', 'photos', 'museums', 'book', 'publishers', 'example', 'Nimoy', 'passion', 'art', 'life', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'play', 'bonus', 'disc', 'enjoyable', 'slide', 'show', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'paintings', 'drawings', 'might', 'guess', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A

He plays both Vincent and Vincent's brother Theo, bringing to life two complex and very different personalities.

That was before every niche cable channel became nothing but Bigfoot/UFO/spoiled table-flipping 'reality' shows. 'Vincent'  is a top notch production and performance by Leonard Nimoy. Enriching and informative, you are THERE as he becomes Theo Van Gogh and you FEEL his passion and that of Vincent. You see the art of Vincent Van Gogh through new eyes and a new soul. This program will make you want to get off of your duff and go seek out great art and that of Van Gogh. You will never see the art of Vincent Van Gogh the same way ever again. Nor that of any other artist. After viewing this, when you look at art you will see the soul and passion of the artist.

When it was released on DVD I had to have a copy for my own library.  He entertains and educates in this one man play.  I knew only that Vincent had been declared a mad man who cut off his ear, but this DVD help me see the tortured soul inside this great artist.  He makes a lovely statement during his play about artists and how they are preceived by their fans and the ordinary people, it rings very true for our generation as well as would it have back in Vincent's day.  Buy it you won't be sorry.  I even purchased it for a friend who I knew would appreciate the wonderful performance given in this play.  Enjoy!
