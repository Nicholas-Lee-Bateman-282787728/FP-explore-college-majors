I asked the dvd guy how much he wanted for it and he said only 5 dollars. So I got this on the very cheep. Apparently from my reasearch this is the ONLY To Hearts dvd box set they came out with. It's very strange to me why they would have a nice hardcover box with only 1 dvd case and the only half is just paper filler so the dvd case wont move around, they could have squeezed the other dvds in but I guess not.

1166171,A2KHKJDDV7MW5R,B001AJXFLG,DPW,"[3, 4]","An excellent anime. This anime was produced in the late 1990's and aired in Japan in 1999. It was acquired by Rightstuf and digitalized (checkout their web sight for details of the effort to restore from film). This story is based on a video game that was popular around the time of this programs release.Each disk has some extras including Line art gallary, Character Bios, Translation notes, Trailers and Mini episodes (minis are only in Japanese language with subtitles). The main episodes do have English language voice track for those of us that hate the aggravasion of reading subtitles.Disk 1 has four episodes. Disks 2,3,& 4 have three episodes and 2 mini episodes.I will leave story reviews and art critique to other reviewers I found nothing to complain about. Overall this is the story of High school students and their interactions. Nothing new here, there is a little of everything and it is interesting as a slice of life program. You could argue that there are better and funnier and more exciting anime of this kind available and you can find far worse.For story and art work 4 stars. For restoration to digital format and providing an English voice track 5 stars.The box set is a good deal. I hope they can acquire the second season someday.Also, the studio that made this anime also made Comic Party. You should see that anime as well as Comic Party Revolution. I Think the ""Comic Party"" anime is a little better than ""ToHeart"" but that is just my opinion.",5,DPW,1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,1474,"['excellent', 'anime', 'anime', 'was', 'produced', 'late', '1990', 'aired', 'Japan', '1999', 'was', 'acquired', 'Rightstuf', 'digitalized', 'checkout', 'web', 'sight', 'details', 'effort', 'restore', 'film', 'story', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'popular', 'time', 'programs', 'release.Each', 'disk', 'extras', 'including', 'Line', 'art', 'gallary', 'Character', 'Bios', 'Translation', 'notes', 'Trailers', 'Mini', 'episodes', 'minis', 'are', 'only', 'Japanese', 'language', 'subtitles', 'main', 'episodes', 'do', 'have', 'English', 'language', 'voice', 'track', 'hate', 'aggravasion', 'reading', 'subtitles.Disk', '1', 'four', 'episodes', 'Disks', '2,3', '4', 'have', 'three', 'episodes', '2', 'mini', 'episodes.I', 'will', 'leave', 'story', 'reviews', 'art', 'critique', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'nothing', 'complain', 'Overall', 'story', 'High', 'school', 'students', 'interactions', 'Nothing', 'new', 'here', 'little', 'everything', 'interesting', 'slice', 'life', 'program', 'could', 'argue', 'are', 'better', 'funnier', 'more', 'exciting', 'anime', 'kind', 'available', 'can', 'find', 'far', 'worse.For', 'story', 'art', 'work', '4', 'stars', 'restoration', 'digital', 'format', 'providing', 'English', 'voice', 'track', '5', 'stars.The', 'box', 'set', 'good', 'deal', 'hope', 'can', 'acquire', 'second', 'season', 'someday.Also', 'studio', 'made', 'anime', 'also', 'made', 'Comic', 'Party', 'should', 'see', 'anime', 'as', 'well', 'Comic', 'Party', 'Revolution', 'Think', 'Comic', 'Party', 'anime', 'little', 'better', 'ToHeart', 'just', 'opinion']",To Heart

It is a good series but i felt like I was left hanging big time. Maybe I'll To Heart 2 and see if it goes further. But as for this DVD collection. It's ok but not great.,3,Needs more depth,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,288,"['heart', 'great', 'potential', 'relationships', 'series', 'never', 'develop', 'far', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'good', 'series', 'i', 'felt', 'was', 'left', 'hanging', 'big', 'time', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'Heart', '2', 'see', 'further', 'DVD', 'collection', 'ok', 'not', 'great']",To Heart
1166173,A2YRZPGWLPB2OF,B001AJXFLG,Kodi Kodai,"[0, 0]","A friend of mine liked the second series of this anime 'To Heart' rather than the first series.  However, I liked the first series of this charming anime. Although the second series may be better than this one (I haven't seen it yet) I enjoyed the first series stories and its characters. It doesn't have any action really but the show is mostly mild drama, humor, fantasy and school-life interplay. It does of course also has a mild flavor of romance, a romance that increases into something more strongly towards the end of the series.'To Heart' is also about character study, but it doesn't go for the loud and outlandish - there's already a lot of that in anime anyway, and so what's here is okay with me. 'To Heart' is about memories of the daily quiet and peaceful times of Akari.  It is also about the inner conflicts between Kamigishi Akari and Nagaoka Shiho (another student of the high school she attends and also a friend). The inner conflicts are not there early, but it quietly and gradually moves to the surface towards the series end.Akari's affections, and the lead character in this anime, is high school student Fujita Hiroyuki. I liked his quietly cool, laid-back, and confident personality.  Maybe I also like him because he's not outlandish or overtly prominent like some other lead characters in other series. We see Hiroyuki's real passion and concerns through his treatment of others: the scene where he rushes to meet Kurisugawa Serika after forgetting their scheduled meeting, I think, is very moving and reveals his concern for being reliable to his friends. Maybe a quiet anime film like 'To Heart' may not be for most people, but there is always the right film for the right viewer whether it's heavy action or mild drama. That's really been the case when viewing any anime.The animation of 'To Heart' has a smoothness and fluidity in its quality, coming from a time when there was more familiarity and attention to subtle 'squash-an-stretch' and 'cushioning' techniques by anime artists in the late 90's. It had become the norm by this time and had been very much mastered compared to the early-to-mid 80s anime which utilized more limited - or less - drawings by the animators in the industry due to budget constraints.  Also, the emergence of Original Animation Video in the indusrty gave more time to explore and refine techniques in the business. The motions of the figures in this anime appears to be very smooth and natural. Also, the results of the fine draftsmanship involved in the use for the designs and colors of the school, the characters, and the look of school-life in general in its details, looks all very beautiful. The music also adds charm to the school-life atmosphere.There are a couple episodes that I admit were rather boring for this viewer and it concerns the two episodes about a student robot.  The episodes are a couple of mild-fantasy stories that I thought didn't go anywhere and so I didn't care much about them. However, there are four episodes I really liked (one concerning a student witch). Maybe the two robot episodes will be more interesting for another viewer.It may not have been a favorite of my friend or other anime fans, but I have often watched 'To Heart' again for its mild drama and humor anyway. I wrote before that there is a strong ending that is reached that reveals Akari's need for his memories - viewing that ending made 'To Heart' one of my personal favorites anime anyway.",4,To Heart,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,3459,"['friend', 'mine', 'liked', 'second', 'series', 'anime', 'Heart', 'rather', 'first', 'series', 'However', 'liked', 'first', 'series', 'charming', 'anime', 'second', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'one', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'series', 'stories', 'characters', ""n't"", 'have', 'action', 'really', 'show', 'mostly', 'mild', 'drama', 'humor', 'fantasy', 'school-life', 'interplay', 'course', 'also', 'mild', 'flavor', 'romance', 'romance', 'something', 'more', 'strongly', 'end', 'series', ""'To"", 'Heart', 'also', 'about', 'character', 'study', ""n't"", 'go', 'loud', 'outlandish', 'already', 'lot', 'anime', 'anyway', 'so', 'what', 'here', 'okay', 'Heart', 'memories', 'daily', 'quiet', 'peaceful', 'times', 'Akari', 'also', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'Kamigishi', 'Akari', 'Nagaoka', 'Shiho', 'student', 'high', 'school', 'also', 'friend', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'early', 'quietly', 'gradually', 'moves', 'surface', 'series', 'end.Akari', 'affections', 'lead', 'character', 'anime', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Fujita', 'Hiroyuki', 'liked', 'quietly', 'cool', 'laid-back', 'confident', 'personality', 'Maybe', 'also', 'like', 'not', 'outlandish', 'overtly', 'prominent', 'other', 'lead', 'characters', 'other', 'series', 'see', 'Hiroyuki', 'real', 'passion', 'concerns', 'treatment', 'others', 'scene', 'where', 'meet', 'Kurisugawa', 'Serika', 'forgetting', 'scheduled', 'meeting', 'think', 'very', 'moving', 'concern', 'being', 'reliable', 'friends', 'Maybe', 'quiet', 'anime', 'film', ""'To"", 'Heart', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'people', 'always', 'right', 'film', 'right', 'viewer', 'heavy', 'action', 'mild', 'drama', 'really', 'been', 'case', 'when', 'viewing', 'anime.The', 'animation', ""'To"", 'Heart', 'smoothness', 'fluidity', 'quality', 'coming', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'more', 'familiarity', 'attention', 'subtle', ""'squash-an-stretch"", ""'cushioning"", 'techniques', 'anime', 'artists', 'late', '90', 'had', 'become', 'norm', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'much', 'mastered', 'compared', 'early-to-mid', '80s', 'anime', 'utilized', 'more', 'limited', 'less', 'drawings', 'animators', 'industry', 'due', 'budget', 'constraints', 'Also', 'emergence', 'Original', 'Animation', 'Video', 'indusrty', 'gave', 'more', 'time', 'explore', 'refine', 'techniques', 'business', 'motions', 'figures', 'anime', 'be', 'very', 'smooth', 'natural', 'Also', 'results', 'fine', 'draftsmanship', 'involved', 'use', 'designs', 'colors', 'school', 'characters', 'look', 'school-life', 'general', 'details', 'very', 'beautiful', 'music', 'also', 'charm', 'school-life', 'are', 'couple', 'admit', 'were', 'rather', 'boring', 'viewer', 'two', 'episodes', 'student', 'robot', 'episodes', 'are', 'couple', 'mild-fantasy', 'stories', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'However', 'are', 'four', 'episodes', 'really', 'liked', 'one', 'concerning', 'student', 'witch', 'Maybe', 'two', 'robot', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'viewer.It', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'favorite', 'friend', 'other', 'anime', 'fans', 'have', 'often', 'watched', ""'To"", 'Heart', 'again', 'mild', 'drama', 'humor', 'anyway', 'wrote', 'strong', 'ending', 'reached', 'Akari', 'need', 'memories', 'viewing', 'ending', 'made', ""'To"", 'Heart', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'anime', 'anyway']",To Heart

It's an old anime and comes from another time when anime was just begining in both technology and skill though not as old as some others and plus you hardly get to see this kind of animation.
