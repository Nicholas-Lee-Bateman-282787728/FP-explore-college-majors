52480,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,0783225504,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[0, 0]","I had never been an Arnold Schwartzenegger fan in the old days of Conan and The Terminator, but I've seen several of his comedy films, and I have to say he has a wonderful sense of the humorous and a charming way with children.  I'd purchased the video of Kindergarten Cop years ago, but when I got my DVD, I gave most of my video collection to the Bone Marrow Transplant wards--because of their immunosupressed status, these patients are sort of a captive audience for quite a while.  I decided to get a new copy for my DVD.  It's a fun, feel good kind of film.  Most of my family have been teachers, so I know about the headaches that teachers experience educating the nation's children.  (Who'd have the courage to spend an entire day in a closed room with ones own children, let alone a small room filled with 25-35 of them!  Teachers not only deserve our respect, they deserve combat pay!)  As Detective John Kimble, Arnold is confronted with some 15 of the most adorable imps from whose mouths spring some of the most extraordinary things.  He suffers the usual ""new teacher"" syndrome:  the kids push him to the limits to see how far they get.  There's really nothing so funny as the ""helpless male"" dealing with a bunch of kids.  Hulk Hogan did the bit beautifully too, in a similar film, but Schwartzenegger is a genius at it.  When his partner insists he leave his gun, but changes her mind because she thinks he'll ""be eaten alive,""  it brings to mind my own antics in the classroom when confronted with the obvious neophyte!  When Kimble punches out the abusive father of one of his pupils, I can almost hear real teachers with similar real battered children cheering him on.  They say that the villains make the film, and Richard Tyson does a superb job, as does Carroll Baker as his mother.  So believably psychopathic is he as Cullen Crisp, one can conceive of very little that makes his end anything but a relief.  The film is notable for the several strong female roles in it.  Another plus in my book.  Carroll Baker, as the villain's equally crazy mother, makes Cruella DuVille seem like a member of the humane society!  Her total indifference to even her son's death, makes her a totally freaky character.  Linda Hunt as the grade school principal is a treat.  Hardly a minute taller than her pupils herself, she makes the ideal administrator in this setting.  One of the funniest scenes is that wherein she gleefully ""feeds"" the undercover cop to the little monsters of the kindergarten class, fully expecting them to rid her of what she obviously perceives as a problem.  And they very nearly do!  Probably my favorite person  in the film is Schartzenegger's partner, Pamela Reed, who plays Detective O'Hara.  She is just wonderful, a perfect foil for her ""serious"" partner John, and she lets forth with some really pithy one-liners.  Probably the star of the film from our perspective was the little Ferret, John's pet and ultimately his life saver.  During the various fire drills, it was amusing to see the duly-designated ferret rescuer retrieve the class mascot from its makeshift cage of laundry baskets and carry it out of the school.  So cute!!A great Family Film, although perhaps a little violent in places.",5,Fun Family Film,1025049600,"06 26, 2002",2002,3238,"['had', 'never', 'been', 'Arnold', 'Schwartzenegger', 'fan', 'old', 'days', 'Conan', 'Terminator', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'comedy', 'films', 'have', 'say', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'humorous', 'charming', 'way', 'children', ""'d"", 'purchased', 'video', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'got', 'DVD', 'gave', 'most', 'video', 'collection', 'Bone', 'Marrow', 'Transplant', 'wards', 'immunosupressed', 'status', 'patients', 'are', 'sort', 'captive', 'audience', 'quite', 'while', 'decided', 'get', 'new', 'copy', 'DVD', 'fun', 'feel', 'good', 'kind', 'film', 'Most', 'family', 'have', 'been', 'teachers', 'know', 'headaches', 'teachers', 'experience', 'educating', 'nation', 'children', 'Who', ""'d"", 'have', 'courage', 'spend', 'entire', 'day', 'closed', 'room', 'ones', 'own', 'children', 'let', 'alone', 'small', 'room', 'filled', '25-35', 'Teachers', 'not', 'only', 'deserve', 'respect', 'deserve', 'combat', 'pay', 'Detective', 'John', 'Kimble', 'Arnold', 'confronted', '15', 'most', 'adorable', 'imps', 'mouths', 'spring', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'things', 'usual', 'new', 'teacher', 'syndrome', 'kids', 'push', 'limits', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'get', 'really', 'nothing', 'so', 'funny', 'helpless', 'male', 'dealing', 'bunch', 'kids', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'did', 'bit', 'beautifully', 'too', 'similar', 'film', 'Schwartzenegger', 'genius', 'When', 'partner', 'leave', 'gun', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'be', 'eaten', 'alive', 'mind', 'own', 'antics', 'classroom', 'when', 'confronted', 'obvious', 'neophyte', 'When', 'Kimble', 'punches', 'out', 'abusive', 'father', 'one', 'pupils', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'real', 'teachers', 'similar', 'real', 'battered', 'children', 'cheering', 'say', 'villains', 'make', 'film', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'superb', 'job', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'mother', 'So', 'believably', 'psychopathic', 'Cullen', 'Crisp', 'one', 'can', 'conceive', 'very', 'little', 'end', 'anything', 'relief', 'film', 'notable', 'several', 'strong', 'female', 'roles', 'plus', 'book', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'villain', 'equally', 'crazy', 'mother', 'Cruella', 'DuVille', 'seem', 'member', 'humane', 'society', 'total', 'indifference', 'even', 'son', 'death', 'totally', 'freaky', 'character', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'grade', 'school', 'principal', 'treat', 'Hardly', 'minute', 'taller', 'pupils', 'ideal', 'administrator', 'setting', 'One', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'wherein', 'gleefully', 'feeds', 'undercover', 'cop', 'little', 'monsters', 'kindergarten', 'class', 'fully', 'expecting', 'rid', 'what', 'obviously', 'problem', 'very', 'nearly', 'do', 'Probably', 'favorite', 'person', 'film', 'Schartzenegger', 'partner', 'Pamela', 'Reed', 'who', 'Detective', ""O'Hara"", 'just', 'wonderful', 'perfect', 'foil', 'serious', 'partner', 'John', 'forth', 'really', 'pithy', 'one-liners', 'Probably', 'star', 'film', 'perspective', 'was', 'little', 'Ferret', 'John', 'pet', 'ultimately', 'life', 'saver', 'various', 'fire', 'drills', 'was', 'amusing', 'see', 'duly-designated', 'ferret', 'rescuer', 'retrieve', 'class', 'mascot', 'makeshift', 'cage', 'laundry', 'baskets', 'carry', 'school', 'cute', 'great', 'Family', 'Film', 'perhaps', 'little', 'violent', 'places']",N/A

52483,A2582KMXLK2P06,0783225504,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Back in the early to mid 90's, family films such as this one were extremely popular.  Everyone seemed to love them, too.  Of course, as time goes on, people eventually get an urge for something different, and that's exactly what happened.  However, looking back, Kindergarten Cop is easily a very pleasant film that holds up nicely, mostly because it's just a simple straight-forward family movie with a nice and easy storyline.  You can easily follow along without getting annoyed at any difficult-to-grasp storyline twists or anything like that.It's funny since I'm an adult now and thinking how back in the day Arnold used to be considered one of the baddest guys in town.  Now, however, you can see there's plenty of action stars who look more impressive.  That's not to take away from his acting abilities.  I'm just pointing out he doesn't look as intimidating to me now.  Sure, his muscles were fairly big in the movie, but we've all seen much bigger.When Arnold walks into a classroom filled with a bunch of 5 year olds, you know it's going to be quite funny.  What's amazing to me is how the children seemed so smart for their age.  They were aware of some adult situations that many kids wouldn't be aware of until they reach 3rd grade.Also, more often than not, the story will switch directions into a bunch of single women finding Arnold attractive as the Kindergarten teacher, and either hitting on him, or trying to look impressive when around him.  These are good scenes as well.Of course, it's a family movie, and looking at some of the children in the Kindergarten class you will recognize a few of them that went on to become even bigger stars.

52485,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,0783225504,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[10, 12]","Long before Californians elected him as the Governator, former elite bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger took Hollywood by storm as The Terminator. An overpowering figure with amazing charisma on and off the screen, Schwarzenegger did his best to secure roles outside of the typecast blood and destruction movies for which he seemed destined. Instead, Arnold showcased his diversity by branching out into differing genres with such flicks as Twins, Junior, and Kindergarten Cop... Arnold's success is apparent in this light-hearted romantic comedy which utilizes his likeability as well as his macho man image. A delightful bit of entertainment, Kindergarten Cop is classic Arnold, spawning another of his usual famous one-liners, ""It's not a tumor""!When Detective John Kimble (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his partner, Phoebe O'Hara (Pamela Reed), get a hot tip that a drug dealer, Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson), who they've long pursued is searching for his ex-wife because of some money she embezzled from his operation, the two detectives go undercover to find the woman before he does. With Crisp's wife, Rachel, being the only one alive capable of testifying against Crisp and putting him jail, Kimble is intent on hunting her down. But all he and O'Hara know is the name of the Oregon school the woman's son attends. A former teacher herself, O'Hara agrees to go undercover as a kindergarten teacher in order to weed out the identity of the boy and his mother.The plan goes awry however, when O'Hara becomes horribly ill, forcing Kimble to become the undercover kindergarten cop. The principal is reluctant, but agrees to give Kimble a try. A horrible disciplinarian with no idea of how to control a group of five-year-olds, Kimble's kindergarten class runs rings around him. A nearby first grade teacher, Joyce Palmieri (Penelope Ann Miller), provides him with advice and pointers - leading to a budding romance between the two. With her son Dominic in the class, Kimble suspects that she may be Crisp's ex-wife, but discounts the possibility once she tells him that her ex-husband is dead.Rallying the class behind his new teaching methods, Kimble becomes one of the top teachers in the school. But his failure to hunt down Crisp's ex-wife provides the drug-dealer with the necessary time to hunt down his wife. Upon Crisp's arrival in town, Kimble and O'Hara learn that his true intention is not the money his ex-wife supposedly stole, but the snatching of his son. Together, they must take on Crisp and his belligerent mother before they kidnap the young boy...A funny and heart-warming comedy, Kindergarten Cop's success rests solely on the shoulders of Arnold Schwarzenegger and his unique onscreen personality. With memorable one-liners and cute kids, the film is fun for the entire family. Although it has a modicum of action, Kindergarten Cop is not to be confused with an action thriller. So if you're looking for that type of film, it's not this one. But overall, Kindergarten Cop is an entertaining way to spend an evening, and for that reason, it's a definite must-see film...The DVD Report",4,"A charming, family-friendly film...",1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,3105,"['Long', 'before', 'Californians', 'elected', 'Governator', 'former', 'elite', 'bodybuilder', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'took', 'Hollywood', 'storm', 'Terminator', 'overpowering', 'figure', 'amazing', 'charisma', 'screen', 'Schwarzenegger', 'did', 'best', 'secure', 'roles', 'typecast', 'blood', 'destruction', 'movies', 'seemed', 'destined', 'Instead', 'Arnold', 'showcased', 'diversity', 'branching', 'out', 'differing', 'genres', 'such', 'flicks', 'Twins', 'Junior', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'Arnold', 'success', 'apparent', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'likeability', 'as', 'well', 'macho', 'man', 'image', 'delightful', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'classic', 'Arnold', 'spawning', 'usual', 'famous', 'one-liners', 'not', 'tumor', 'When', 'Detective', 'John', 'Kimble', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'partner', 'Phoebe', ""O'Hara"", 'Pamela', 'Reed', 'get', 'hot', 'tip', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Cullen', 'Crisp', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'who', ""'ve"", 'long', 'pursued', 'searching', 'ex-wife', 'money', 'embezzled', 'operation', 'two', 'detectives', 'go', 'undercover', 'find', 'woman', 'Crisp', 'wife', 'Rachel', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'alive', 'capable', 'testifying', 'Crisp', 'putting', 'jail', 'Kimble', 'intent', 'hunting', 'down', ""O'Hara"", 'know', 'name', 'Oregon', 'school', 'woman', 'son', 'former', 'teacher', 'herself', ""O'Hara"", 'go', 'undercover', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'order', 'weed', 'out', 'identity', 'boy', 'mother.The', 'plan', 'awry', 'however', 'when', ""O'Hara"", 'horribly', 'ill', 'forcing', 'Kimble', 'become', 'undercover', 'kindergarten', 'cop', 'principal', 'reluctant', 'give', 'Kimble', 'try', 'horrible', 'disciplinarian', 'idea', 'how', 'control', 'group', 'five-year-olds', 'Kimble', 'kindergarten', 'class', 'rings', 'nearby', 'first', 'grade', 'teacher', 'Joyce', 'Palmieri', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'advice', 'pointers', 'leading', 'budding', 'romance', 'two', 'son', 'Dominic', 'class', 'Kimble', 'may', 'be', 'Crisp', 'ex-wife', 'possibility', 'once', 'ex-husband', 'dead.Rallying', 'class', 'new', 'teaching', 'methods', 'Kimble', 'one', 'top', 'teachers', 'school', 'failure', 'hunt', 'down', 'Crisp', 'ex-wife', 'drug-dealer', 'necessary', 'time', 'hunt', 'down', 'wife', 'Crisp', 'arrival', 'town', 'Kimble', ""O'Hara"", 'learn', 'true', 'intention', 'not', 'money', 'ex-wife', 'supposedly', 'stole', 'snatching', 'son', 'Together', 'must', 'take', 'Crisp', 'belligerent', 'mother', 'kidnap', 'young', 'boy', 'funny', 'heart-warming', 'comedy', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'success', 'solely', 'shoulders', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'unique', 'onscreen', 'personality', 'memorable', 'one-liners', 'cute', 'kids', 'film', 'fun', 'entire', 'family', 'modicum', 'action', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'action', 'thriller', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'type', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'overall', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'entertaining', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'reason', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

Then the principal lets him come back to the school as a teacher after he's put all the kids' lives at risk.

Hey, it's a lot more convincing than John Kerry's.  Especially since this movie is so irresistible.You just have to see the scene in which John Kimble reads the kids a poem about clouds.  (Incidentally, it's Spring Morning"" from A.A. Milne's book, ""When We Were Very Young."") Schwarzenegger displays a Richard Belzer kind of tenderness.  Then he will turn around and beat the living daylights out of the abusive father in the film (""He fell down.  You all say the same thing."")Kimble's relationship with Grace is moving and convincing and his camaraderie with his female partner Phoebe is evocative of Detectives Benson and Stabler in ""Law & Order: SVU"".  I love the scene in which he makes up an entire background (something cops are used to doing) and Phoebe pretends to have an Austrian accent (she's almost more convincing than Ah-nold.)The childrens' loyalty and response to Kimble is a joy to see.

It paired him  back up with Twins director Ivan Reitman and I don't think mainstream America could see Arnold in this film.John Kimble(Schwarzenegger) is a detective that loves his job. He is trying to bring down a drug lord Crisp(Tyson). To do that he must find Crisp's ex-wife and child. They have the evidence he needs to do that, but nobody is quite sure where they are. They are found though and they are living in the small town of Asotria, Oregon. Kimble then teams up with his new partner Phoebe(Reed) to go there and find them.They go to Oregon and have arrangements made for Phoebe to go undercover at the local school. They know Crisps kid would be five and should be in kindergarten. There is only one kindergarten class so he has to be there. After Phoebe gets sick somebody has to fill in and Kimble steps up. He'll take her place and pretend to be a kindergarten teacher.The plan quickly backfires in his place. He barely makes it through his first day. If it werent' for another teacher Joyce(Miller) he wouldn't have made it. I'm not going to reveal anymore of the plot because it spoils the movie and this really is a fun movie.Arnold Schwarzenegger is the man in the movie. You have to love watching him interact with the kids in the movie. He is so much bigger than all of them, most of them are only up past his knees. You get to see a softer side of Arnold and at this point this was only the second family oriented movie he had made other than Twins. A lot of people didn't think he could interact with the kids and he shines.The kids are fantastic in the movie. This kind of movie all depends on the chemistry of the kids and the star. You can tell the kids loved working with Arnold and why wouldn't they have. At this time in his carear he was the biggest action star in Hollywood. All the kids are great and they will leave you laughing and smiling.Some have said this really isn't all that of a kids movie. I have to agree with them in some ways. I saw if for the first time at 8 years old and I had no problem with it. Some kids might not understand why the mom and kid are running and thats up to parents to explain that to them. Parts of the movie are a little violent and there is some swearing but it's all PG-13 stuff.I love this movie. I've enjoyed it for over a decade now.

First, we would just like to review this documentary about a time in Arnold Schwarzenegger's life when he decided to be an undercover cop and a kindergarten teacher at the same time. Thus, the documentary is entitled Kindergarten Cop. This film gives us some possible insight as to why Arnold can barley speak. Not once during the film did he teach his students academics. Instead, he focused on sit-ups, propper technique for lat pull-downs, and his ferret(which came out like fuerrett when Arnold said it).This man is amazing. In the 70's he allowed filmmakers to document his life as a 5-time Mr. Olympia, the title given to the world's foremost consumer of grilled chicken. Then, in 1990, he let us back into his life as we see his softer side while he saves a young boy and his mother from a very dangerous Steven Segal lookalike. Arnold goes undercover in a small Oregon town to find the son and ex-wife of the villan and his mother who is also a villan. Strange subplot here. Anyway, Arnold finally finds out who the mother and ex are and actually falls in love with the ex-wife. One of the biggest shocks of the movie comes at the end, when someone unexpected saves the day. Anyway, back to Arnold. He is now governor of the great state of Cali-fornia. Amazing! The reason Sid loves Arnold so much is because there are a number of soundboards dedicated to him and Kindergarten Cop features a whopping 28 soundboard lines that make this unintentional comedy comedy hillarious. That's the best part of the movie, picking out soundboard lines.So, if someone tells you Kindergarten Cop is a bad movie, say ""No it is not true.

52577,AP3B615GM191G,0783225504,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","When people think back on the career of Arnold Schwarzenegger, they will most likely strike upon his ""Terminator"" role, his portrayal of musclebound ""Conan the Barbarian"", and his penchant for shoot-em-up 1980's action flicks.  However, ""Kindergarten Cop"" gives Arnold perhaps his most complete vehicle for showcasing all sides of his acting talent.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees undercover cop John Kimble (Arnold) become a kindergarten teacher in order to scope out baddie Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson).  While teaching (or trying to, anyway!), he completely falls for a fellow teacher (Penelope Ann Miller) and forms a strong bond with her son (Joseph/Christian Cullins).What makes this movie such a classic effort is that it is so multi-dimensional.  Included are...-A typical gun-toting Arnie taking the law into his own hands.-Some hilarious comedy that will have you laughing out loud on numerous occasions.-Rich, developed characters that help suck you into the well-constructed plot.-A light, more romantic side of Arnold.All these different scenarios, mixed together perfectly by director Ivan Reitman, create a film in which every scene offers something to behold.  Watching Mr. Kimble struggle with his new young charges is hilarious, while scenes towards the end of the flick will have you on the edge of your seat and perhaps even in real suspense.Overall, then, I consider ""K-Cop"" to be perhaps the most well-rounded performance of Schwarzenegger's career...and just a darn good movie to boot!  Though some scenes will be too graphic or inappropriate for the real young kiddies, this is also a film that can be enjoyed by the whole family...again, because it offers so many different genres.",5,Maybe Arnold's Best Overall Work,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,1716,"['When', 'people', 'think', 'back', 'career', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'strike', 'Terminator', 'role', 'portrayal', 'musclebound', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'penchant', 'shoot-em-up', '1980', 'action', 'flicks', 'However', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'Arnold', 'perhaps', 'most', 'complete', 'vehicle', 'showcasing', 'sides', 'acting', 'talent.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'undercover', 'cop', 'John', 'Kimble', 'Arnold', 'become', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'order', 'scope', 'out', 'baddie', 'Cullen', 'Crisp', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'teaching', 'trying', 'anyway', 'completely', 'fellow', 'teacher', 'Penelope', 'Ann', 'Miller', 'strong', 'bond', 'son', 'Joseph/Christian', 'Cullins', 'movie', 'classic', 'effort', 'so', 'multi-dimensional', 'Included', 'are', '-A', 'typical', 'gun-toting', 'Arnie', 'taking', 'law', 'own', 'hands.-Some', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'numerous', 'occasions.-Rich', 'developed', 'characters', 'help', 'suck', 'well-constructed', 'plot.-A', 'light', 'more', 'romantic', 'side', 'Arnold.All', 'different', 'scenarios', 'mixed', 'together', 'perfectly', 'director', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'create', 'film', 'scene', 'something', 'behold', 'Watching', 'Mr.', 'Kimble', 'new', 'young', 'charges', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'end', 'flick', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'perhaps', 'even', 'real', 'suspense.Overall', 'then', 'consider', 'K-Cop', 'be', 'perhaps', 'most', 'well-rounded', 'performance', 'Schwarzenegger', 'career', 'just', 'darn', 'good', 'movie', 'boot', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'graphic', 'inappropriate', 'real', 'young', 'kiddies', 'also', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'whole', 'family', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'genres']",N/A
