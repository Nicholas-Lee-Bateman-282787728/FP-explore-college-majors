1279448,A2V5AGMDQ7A5XM,B002N5N5SO,adamKS,"[39, 60]","the office has definitely lost its ""charm"" and ""magic"" in season 6. you can tell by even the dvd boxset cover with jim/michael/pam holding hands. . .just further proves what the show has become. literal, obvious, idiotic, cheesy, and lame. i mean seriously, anyone who says season 6 is ""office-worthy"" or that is was ""great"" is not a fan from the beginning. i find that nearly impossible because the show now is far from what it was in previous seasons. any hardcore fan can see that the writers got lazy this season and are trying to appeal to the general public more now than the niche, hardcore fanbase that was there in the first 3 seasons of so. . .like everyone else is saying, introducing sabre and kathy bates in this season was a TERRIBLE idea. along with weeding out and losing the david wallace character. i loved the david wallace character and thought he really added alot of heart and depth to the show. And who is his replacement as new boss? . . . kathy bates as ""Jo"". kathy bates literally sucked all the funny out of every episode she was in. her accent was not believable and not one thing she said all season was funny or added anything to the show. while actually the gabe character was funny for the most part, and was a bright spot in the season.what really irks me is how all the characters have changed drastically this season. . . .what has happened to jim?? he doesn't even act like himself and doesn't bust anyone's chops or is even sarcastic and belittling to anyone anymore. that's what made the jim character so great and comical. . .because he was smarter, more clever, and essentially ""above"" everyone else in the office intelluctually and humor-wise, except maybe pam who was on his level. now jim is down to everyone else's level in the office and his character is essentially ""boring"" now. not to mention, WHY is jim doing cheesy voice impressions?!? sure, he did an impression of stanley in season 2 but that was funny. in season 6, the impressions are often and are adorable, cheesy, and idiotic. the old jim halpert would NEVER do these!!i vote the ""who done it"" episode, ""where they play that ""clue-esque"" board game to find out who the fictional murdererer was to distract everyone of what's really going on; which was inevidentily dunder mifflins demise, as the worst episode in season 6. in this episode they all used cheesy/lame voice impressions playing different characters in the game including the painfully idiotic and lame standoff at the end of the episode with fake finger-pistols pointed at each other"" and even PAM was playing this idiotic, juvenile charade well after the game was over. this was by far the WORST episode in season 6 (and there were alot of these). i almost stopped being a fan after seeing that one, i felt like the episode was insulting my intelligence or something. most of season 6 was like that. . . the writers just totally DUMBED-DOWN the humor to an obvious, lame, idiotic level.does anyone else get this impression from season 6?i also dislike how pam is so forward, obnoxious, and outspoken now. she's incredibly blunt and almost cold in season 6. like when she found out michael was dating her mom. . . .the way she acted and how violent she was toward michael, really made me dislike pam for the first time ever on the show. i thought that was not a good move by the writers, since she's always been a loveable, sweet character in previous seasons.remember when michael use to be so dry, subtle, and awkward?? in season 6 he is so ""literal"" and ""zany"" and his character is downright ""silly"" now. i love how when he use to act childish or inappropiate in past seasons he would blame someone or something for the way he was acting. . . .now, he just accepts his silly actions and behavior and that's it. that's just his character now. . . .and it's not funny at all.and as for the daryl promotion. . .promoting daryl was obviously a move due to his recent rise in popularity outside the office. it seems forced and nothing interesting came of his promotion. it was done just to basically give craig robinson (daryl) more screen time. another example of how lame and tacky the show has gotten.dwight's character has also changed. it feels like they are overdoing his character and persona way too much and it doesn't feel natural or authentic like in the past. plus, dwight is now independent of michael and he acts like an evil comic book villian in most of the episodes. he's overly confident and almost barbaric in season 6, and it was NOT FUNNY. i miss the wise, naive, and insecure dwight so much it hurts. . .season 6 was so lacking and just bad for the most part IMO with only a few great moments and a few solid episodes. since steve carell is leaving after next season i hope the writers can get together and make this last season a worthy one for all the fans and send michael scott (steve carell) off right. i just hope they don't try to go on without steve because we saw what happened when they tried to go on without zach braff with scrubs, the show failed. so if the original writers/creators of the show (daniels and schurr) can come back for season 7 (maybe that's why parks and rec is starting in mid season next year, so they can wrap up and work on the final season of the office, and season 2 of parks and recreation was fantastic btw) and give this show a great ending and finale, myself and all office fans from the beginning would greatly appreciate it.",2,"Attention season 6 writers: subtle and awkward is funny, cute and obvious is NOT. . .",1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,5457,"['office', 'definitely', 'lost', 'charm', 'magic', 'season', '6.',

Also, I frequently felt the deleted scenes should've stayed in instead of much of the kept scenes. While this show doesn't have much consistancy in general this season is particularly bad in this area where it seemed almost nothing had any effect in later eps. Don't get me wrong, this season definitely had its moments, but they were few and far between. Many of the jokes were more for shock-value instead of actual humor and Jim & Pam are just plain boring now. The show is still great, but with only about 50% of the eps being good this season (at best) it is clear the show is losing some steam, which is a turning point few shows fully recover from.

1279462,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B002N5N5SO,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[20, 36]","The Office was one of the seminal comedies of the decade. Starting off slow with an underrated 1st season, then coming into its own and hitting its peak of creativity in the 2nd season. But since then, the quality of the comedy & the storylines have started to degrade. First it started off slow, each season progressively getting worse than the last, until this season. It actually quite fine for the first half of the season, coming up with one of its best episodes with some of its best moments yet (Niagara), but as soon as the show came back from Christmas break, it fell head-first off a cliff.Episode Highlights Include:NiagaraThe LoverMurderThe DeliveryWhat happens in the 2nd half of the season? Well, Sabre happens. It did give us the sometimes funny character of Gabe, and it did start well-enough with a Christian Slater cameo, but those were the only good/memorable parts about it. Granted, I wasn't any fan of Kathy Bates to begin with, but she is simply annoying and underused here. The writers simply don't know what to do with her, and Kathy Bates can't bring anything new to a poorly-written character. Every moment of Kathy Bates on screen is a moment you will want back because it will be unfunny & utterly wasted in the worst way possible. Every move she makes. Every thing she says. Just, simply awful.Granted, I understand why the writers did it, because they felt like the economy has to have an impact on our favorite company in Dunder-Mifflin. Just think about it for a second. They killed off Dunder-Mifflin. I have a great T-shirt that advertises my love of the show with the Dunder-Mifflin logo. And they're just going to kill it off because of the economy? There were probably ways in which to make this story to work, but the writers choose NONE of them.Then there's the characters. Oh, how I just want to slap every writer for this travesty. The writers have always struggled with Michael Scott. Sometimes he's a playful man-child who's immature, sometimes he's the serious boss not afraid to get onto his employees, or actually show why he's in the job, or that he has actual salesmanship. However, the writers stick with the immature Michael for much of the season, and it's getting to the point where enough is enough. The man is becoming a parody of himself. He still goes for the damaged women, and he still proceeds to screw it up with every one of them, then has an affair with a married woman. Just please, stop. The only episode where Michael even resembles his old self is one that Steve Carell directed himself. The case is the same for Dwight. Dwight works in a very specific box. Taken too far, it's an insane jerk. This is the mode he spends most of the season in. Dwight has always been a character best suited for being the receiving end of a joke, since the guy needs to be taken down a peg every once in a while. Of course, there are one, maybe two, possibly three moments of this the whole season. So frustrating!As for the highlights, Jim & Pam are still as great as ever, if a bit underused. Also, Erin comes into her own as a character. She's given a wacky backstory, she's given a nice relationship with Andy, and she's just great with everything she does. She's like the opposite of Kathy Bates. Every scene that Erin is in is made better by her presence. Her personality just radiates sunshine and goodness.Overall, as a die-hard Office fan, this season was frustrating with brief glimpses of goodness. The well has been run dry, the ideas are stale, the characters are in a rut. Oh sweet release, I now pray for a graceful ending to the show. Of course, looking back on Niagara, I would actually be really satisfied with that as a series finale. But since the series will go on for at least a year and a half after that, it will just be the ending in my mind. Steve Carell and the rest of the cast simply don't need to be subjected to this anymore. It's time to move on.",2,At Least Erin Was Cute...,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,3928,"['Office', 'was', 'one', 'seminal', 'comedies', 'decade', 'Starting', 'off', 'slow', 'underrated', '1st', 'season', 'then', 'coming', 'own', 'hitting', 'peak', 'creativity', '2nd', 'season', 'then', 'quality', 'comedy', 'storylines', 'have', 'started', 'degrade', 'First', 'started', 'off', 'slow', 'season', 'progressively', 'getting', 'worse', 'last', 'season', 'actually', 'quite', 'fine', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'coming', 'up', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'best', 'moments', 'yet', 'Niagara', 'as', 'soon', 'show', 'came', 'back', 'Christmas', 'break', 'fell', 'head-first', 'cliff.Episode', 'Highlights', 'Include', 'NiagaraThe', 'LoverMurderThe', 'DeliveryWhat', '2nd', 'half', 'season', 'Well', 'Sabre', 'did', 'give', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'character', 'Gabe', 'did', 'start', 'well-enough', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'cameo', 'were', 'only', 'good/memorable', 'parts', 'Granted', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'begin', 'simply', 'annoying', 'underused', 'here', 'writers', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'poorly-written', 'character', 'moment', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'screen', 'moment', 'will', 'want', 'back', 'will', 'be', 'unfunny', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'worst', 'way', 'possible', 'move', 'Every', 'thing', 'Just', 'simply', 'awful.Granted', 'understand', 'why', 'writers', 'did', 'felt', 'economy', 'have', 'impact', 'favorite', 'company', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'Just', 'think', 'second', 'killed', 'off', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'have', 'great', 'T-shirt', 'love', 'show', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'logo', ""'re"", 'just', 'going', 'kill', 'off', 'economy', 'were', 'probably', 'ways', 'make', 'story', 'work', 'writers', 'choose', 'NONE', 'them.Then', 'characters', 'Oh', 'how', 'just', 'want', 'slap', 'writer', 'travesty', 'writers', 'have', 'always', 'struggled', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Sometimes', 'playful', 'man-child', 'who', 'immature', 'sometimes', 'serious', 'boss', 'not', 'afraid', 'get', 'employees', 'actually', 'show', 'why', 'job', 'actual', 'salesmanship', 'However', 'writers', 'stick', 'immature', 'Michael', 'much', 'season', 'getting', 'point', 'where', 'enough', 'enough', 'man', 'becoming', 'parody', 'still', 'damaged', 'women', 'still', 'screw', 'up', 'one', 'then', 'affair', 'married', 'woman', 'Just', 'please', 'stop', 'only', 'episode', 'where', 'Michael', 'even', 'old', 'self', 'one', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'directed', 'case', 'same', 'Dwight', 'Dwight', 'very', 'specific', 'box', 'Taken', 'too', 'far', 'insane', 'jerk', 'mode', 'most', 'season', 'Dwight', 'always', 'been', 'character', 'best', 'suited', 'being', 'receiving', 'end', 'joke', 'guy', 'be', 'taken', 'down', 'peg', 'once', 'while', 'course', 'are', 'one', 'maybe', 'two', 'possibly', 'three', 'moments', 'whole', 'season', 'So', 'frustrating', 'highlights', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'are', 'still', 'as', 'great', 'ever', 'bit', 'underused', 'Also', 'Erin', 'own', 'character', 'given', 'wacky', 'backstory', 'given', 'nice', 'relationship', 'Andy', 'just', 'great', 'everything', 'opposite', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Every', 'scene', 'Erin', 'made', 'better', 'presence', 'Her', 'personality', 'just', 'sunshine', 'goodness.Overall', 'die-hard', 'Office', 'fan', 'season', 'was', 'frustrating', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'goodness', 'well', 'been', 'run', 'dry', 'ideas', 'are', 'stale', 'characters', 'are', 'rut', 'Oh', 'sweet', 'release', 'now', 'pray', 'graceful', 'ending', 'show', 'course', 'looking', 'back', 'Niagara', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'really', 'satisfied', 'series', 'finale', 'series', 'will', 'go', 'least', 'year', 'half', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'ending', 'mind', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'rest', 'cast', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'subjected', 'anymore', 'time', 'move']",N/A
1279463,A8G2TXIM1OM7N,B002N5N5SO,goozemann,"[12, 22]","I'll have to disagree with some of the other reviews here.  I think that The Office was the best comedy since Seinfeld.  Notice I said ""was"", for unfortunately it is now on the brink of decline.  Let me elaborate.  The subject matter has gone where no comedy should ever go, that being ""wedding"" and ""baby"" episodes.  That usually spells the death of a great comedy.  And I don't consider ""Friends"" or ""ONe Day at a Time"" classic comedies. Notice Seinfeld never went there.  Cheers never went there with Sam and Diane.  That's because, in general, no matter how hard they try, those topics are just not funny.  Office Stud Jim gets office hottie Pam, knocks her up, and she has a baby. Uh, is that funny?  No, you see it every day all around you. It would have been funnier to have Pam reject Jim again, and somehow wind up dating Michael, or even Oscar, hell even Creed.  The ""baby"" and ""wedding"" episodes usually lead to the more serious ""family issue"" episodes where the comedy tries to address ""serious"" issues, ala what All in the Family started to do. What next, the ""Pam has a miscarriage"" episode?  It never works, and it essentially signals the death of the show.  Keep the show silly and over the top. That's what made Seinfeld so great. And Michael winds up dating every woman he is introduced to?  I wish I lived in that world. Did the show get new writers or something?Ah well, it was a good run, and the early season episodes are damn classics.",3,Starting the Decline.....,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,1458,"[""'ll"", 'have', 'disagree', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'think', 'Office', 'was', 'best', 'comedy', 'Seinfeld', 'Notice', 'said', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'now', 'brink', 'decline', 'Let', 'elaborate', 'subject', 'matter', 'gone', 'where', 'comedy', 'should', 'ever', 'go', 'being', 'wedding', 'baby', 'episodes', 'usually', 'death', 'great', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Friends', 'ONe', 'Day', 'Time', 'classic', 'comedies', 'Notice', 'Seinfeld', 'never', 'went', 'there', 'Cheers', 'never', 'went', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'because', 'general', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'topics', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'Office', 'Stud', 'Jim', 'office', 'hottie', 'Pam', 'up', 'baby', 'Uh', 'funny', 'No', 'see', 'day', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'have', 'Pam', 'reject', 'Jim', 'again', 'somehow', 'wind', 'up', 'dating', 'Michael', 'even', 'Oscar', 'hell', 'even', 'Creed', 'baby', 'wedding', 'episodes', 'usually', 'lead', 'more', 'serious', 'family', 'issue', 'episodes', 'where', 'comedy', 'tries', 'address', 'serious', 'issues', 'ala', 'what', 'Family', 'started', 'do', 'What', 'next', 'Pam', 'miscarriage', 'episode', 'never', 'essentially', 'death', 'show', 'Keep', 'show', 'silly', 'top', 'what', 'made', 'Seinfeld', 'so', 'great', 'Michael', 'up', 'dating', 'woman', 'introduced', 'wish', 'lived', 'world', 'Did', 'show', 'get', 'new', 'writers', 'something', 'Ah', 'well', 'was', 'good', 'run', 'early', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'damn', 'classics']",N/A
1279464,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002N5N5SO,Haunted Flower,"[2, 3]","24 Episodes on 5 DVD Discs, released September 7, 2010The series that was adapted from the British series of the same name by Greg Daniels made it all the way to a sixth season with Steve Carell as the much beloved and behooved Michael Scott. What will follow in season 7 without him? Who knows. All I know is that the sixth season was full of lots of laughs, lots of fun, and LOTS of Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer), the power couple at the center of the show. I along with many other fans really enjoyed them finally getting together and the wedding troubles were pretty funny, but the baby drama began to outwear its welcome as the season progressed.At the end of season 5, we discovered Pam was pregnant and Jim and Pam hurriedly made plans for their wedding in Niagara Falls hoping that not as many people would attend until boss, Michael Scott gave the entire office the long weekend off. Going through the season, eventually Pam gave birth in the typical ""The Office"" way (with Michael Scott present) and lots of shenanigans along the way.Michael had several love interests including Pam's mother and at the end of the season, a married woman named Donna (""That makes me 'the other man'!""). As usual, he got himself and others into trouble often, especially in working with the transitions of the printer company, Sabre and CEO Jo Bennett played by guest star Kathy Bates and accompanied by large dogs.Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) hooked up with Pam's sister, making Angela very jealous. Pam and Jim's pregnancy made them both aware of their ticking clocks and Angela and Dwight entered into a procreation contract. B.J. Novak as Ryan is firmly back in his place as extra/temp/sidelined character which is probably the best thing for the show with all the new characters and the emphasis on Michael, Dwight, Jim, and Pam in focus.Special Features:There is nearly half an hour's worth of bloopers so that's pretty awesome! Also there is over two hours worth of deleted scenes, for instance an extended sequence of Jim and Pam tapping morse code in front of Dwight.There is an original digital short called ""The Podcast"" about the new HR guy trying to start a podcast after hearing about the success of Oscar's blog on the Sabre website. There are short promos for ""The Office"" about the Toronto Olympics. If you ever wanted to try out ""Parks and Recreation"", there is an episode from Season 2 called ""Hunting Trip"" where the men's yearly hunting trip is invaded by the women and someone gets shot and no one will come forward to admit they did it.Deleted Scenes are hilarious since they never run out of ideas, but most of the stuff that hits the cutting room floor has to do with supporting cast members. The Blooper Reel of course involves line flubs and their situations being too ridiculous to keep a straight face. You also get to watch the full short video ""Welcome to Sabre"" to explain to Dunder Mifflin how they have been bought by Sabre and hosted by Christian Slater (as himself) and Kathy Bates as Jo Bennett, CEO.There are four episodes with commentary by cast and crew for ""Niagara"", ""Murder"", ""Secret Santa"", ""The Delivery"", and ""Happy Hour"" with only a few cast members on some of them: Jenna Fischer (Pam), Mindy Kaling (Kelly Kapoor), Ellie Kemper (Erin), Oscar Nu&ntilde;ez (Oscar), B. J. Novak (Ryan), Angela Kinsey (Angela), and Brian Baumgartner (Kevin).

Le,"[52, 70]","I just want to express how ripped off I feel that after buying the entire season 6 of The Office the Halloween open is missing from the episode Koi Pond.  I hope that NBC and the creators/actors of The Office read this and realize how they are making their fans feel ripped off.  If they were going to remove it from the episode, they should have included it in the deleted scenes.  To make matters worse they included a still pic on the menu of Disc 2 just to remind us what we're missing.  I tried to see if maybe it was hidden as an Easter Egg but have had no luck.  Perhaps if everyone expressed how disappointed they were, Universal will create replacement discs.  We are paying for the ENTIRE season of The Office including DELETED and BONUS material.  I hate it when organizations complain and get ""offended"" by things thereby making it impossible for everyone else in the world to enjoy it.  I don't care if the American Society for Suicide Prevention was offended by a FICTIONAL character making an inappropriate joke.  Newsflash: the Michael Scott character's main purpose on the show is to make inappropriate jokes.  It's almost like they were just sitting around waiting to find something to be offended by so they could shove their cause down everyone's throat.  Seriously, if someone were actually going to kill themselves they would do it regardless of if they saw an episode of The Office or not.  And don't try to say someone might see it and then decide to kill themselves.  That's just stupid.  If by any means that were true, it would be a Darwin Award.  Why not stop there then?  Why not omit all the Erin scenes where she says she's been in foster care because that might be offensive to people who were in foster care?  Why not omit the Dwight character when he talks about his farm because that might be offensive to people who own farms?  Why not omit the episodes where Pam is pregnant before marriage because that might offend people who are against pre-marital sex?  You see where I'm going with this.  If every single comedian or comedy show adhered to trying not to offend people, there would never be anything on TV ever.  Do you think the creators of South Park care who they offend?  In fact, that's what makes the show funny.  Do you think Dave Chappelle decided not to certain skits because they might be ""offensive"" to people?  Seriously people if you work in comedy, it's a given you're eventually going to offend someone somewhere at sometime.  And for all those complainer or ""offended"" people out there.

I think that the main problem with this season is that there are way too many moments when one thinks ""Would that character really do that?""  Think back to seasons 1-3.  Would Pam Beesley throw a screaming fit like a child?  And then verbally abuse her boss?  Sure she just found out Michael Scott is a little too intimate with a member of her family but I really don't think she would have.  Pam used to be a likeable character because of her quietness (I do understand that she's supposedly out of her shell because she's with Jim now but it still doesn't fit)  I think the comedy moved far too close to slapstick as opposed to subtle and thoughtful.  Kathy Bates is a great actress but I don't think she adds to the show.  She provides little to no laugh-out-loud comedy and her character is a little too silly for a show that should be more grounded (who brings two large dogs with them everywhere and says ""they like a good crotch"")?  While these are some potentially heartbreaking changes I do still appreciate these episodes, even some of the ones with out-of-character moments.  Of course there were still many many laughs and great character moments and that is why I still think this show is better than most of what is on TV--even in it's current condition--but any Office fan who's been there from the beginning can't help but wish that the writers will get it right after this.  The Blu-Ray set has a ton of deleted scenes and a couple nice commentaries.  The blooper real is nearly a half-hour long and is hilarious.  The actual packaging is frustrating because the discs are very hard to remove from their ""prisons"".  The discs are held in so irrationally that I can't help but wonder if the person that designed them is trying to torture people that buy the Blu-Ray.

(I consider the content to be too subjective, you know whether or not you like the show.)Another awful Blu-ray release from Universal. First off, out of the box, is the irony that you can't get the discs out of the box! This is the second Universal release I've gotten that absolutely disgusts me with the packaging. The disc is clipped in at 4 points around the disc, making a small plastic prison. You have to pry this and that way in order to get it out. Good luck not breaking it! Thankfully, Blu-ray discs are more resilient than DVD, otherwise, it would have broken already. I also hate slipcases, but that's a matter of personal opinion, and common practice with multi-disc sets. Second, they ruined the content of the discs. In the episode ""Koi Pond"" which is the annual halloween episode, they cut out the opening scene of the ware(haunted)house. That was one of the funniest moments of the entire season. I know some rights groups complained because there was a hanging scene, but this is a disc for private home use. Absurd. Third, the discs are faulty. I couldn't get the fourth episode on disc one to play. I contacted Universal directly. To their credit, they suggested I upgrade my player firmware (which for some people, who aren't technically savvy, can be frustrating or even result in damaged equipment) and disable internet connectivity. After I completed that lengthy task, yes, THAT episode now plays. Some of the other discs have experienced skipping and freezing. When I replay the parts that skip or freeze, sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. This is the ONLY Blu-ray or DVD set that doesn't play right on my Blu-ray player with upgraded firmware. Universal is taking the stance that ""it's the rest of the world, not us."" Interweb searches of trouble with this Blu-ray set confirm that it's not just me having problems with the discs. If I HAD known that there would be these issues, I would have waited to purchase my set. Many times, manufacturers release large batches of discs that are bad. If you wait a while for stocks to be depleted, you may get a different batch. You usually also get it cheaper too. My advice: wait a few months to buy your copy. This is more frustrating than when Universal did the same thing with Scrubs a few years back. At least then, they admitted their mistake. Not this time.

Having watched the older shows repeatedly, the 6th season is still funny compared to many of the previous.  A number of past episodes were a bit disturbing or unfunny, so much so that I avoid them when watching the DVD's.  I do have to say the episode concerning Michael's relationship with the married bar manager in season 6 was one of my least favorite and I started to have a lot less empathy for him.  Had this been the first show I'd watched, I probably wouldn't have watched any more.  Kathy Bates did a great job in her episodes, although I'm not sure I like the whole dissolving of Dunder Miflin in season 6.  The show does need to lighten back up and return to what it used to be.  I'm still giving it a shot to improve.Now what I do have to say is that I like how the last disc of each season (2-5) has a very lengthy blooper segment.  Those are pretty hilarious.

In fact, they almost all happened before that.Sure, there are some lousy episodes in this season.

Heck, before that I watched the British version of the series and still found the Americanized first season worthwhile. ""The Office"" is one of those rare shows that improved on its original source as it went on with each season. By the sixth season radical change occurred--Dunder Mifflin was bought out by a company that manufactured printers and Jo (Kathy Bates) the owner of Sabre planted herself in the office long enough to add some great awakward moments with Michael (Steve Carrell always delightfully unPC)nevertheless, the sale of Dunder-Mifflin and introduction of new characters shifting the relationships within the office (and less Michael-Dwight-Jim craziness)undermined the comedy during the sixth season. While there were highlights (the Christmas episode with ""crabby Jesus"")they were fewer and far between.As with previous seasons the DVD presentation looks quite nice. The extras are quite good as well although I do wish that at some point they would have roped in Steve Carrell to do a commentary track with others from the cast. Many of the deleted scenes when played together almost play like mini-episodes outside of the episode themselves.I still really dislike the packaging for this show as it doesn't stand up to wear and tear as well as many other season sets out there.While the sixth season had less highlights compared to previous ones, this season still has some strong and very funny episodes. The Seventh season in comparison stumbles around like a drunk in a room full of toys without the humor that was a highlight of previous seasons even this one.",3,"""The Office"" slowly sinks into mediocrity with the sixth season--doesn't compare to prevous seasons some good episodes though",1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,1636,"[""'ve"", 'followed', 'Office', 'first', 'season', 'Heck', 'watched', 'British', 'version', 'series', 'still', 'found', 'Americanized', 'first', 'season', 'worthwhile', 'Office', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'improved', 'original', 'source', 'went', 'season', 'sixth', 'season', 'radical', 'change', 'occurred', 'Dunder', 'Mifflin', 'was', 'bought', 'out', 'company', 'manufactured', 'printers', 'Jo', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'owner', 'Sabre', 'planted', 'office', 'long', 'enough', 'add', 'great', 'awakward', 'moments', 'Michael', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'always', 'delightfully', 'unPC', 'nevertheless', 'sale', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'introduction', 'new', 'characters', 'shifting', 'relationships', 'office', 'less', 'Michael-Dwight-Jim', 'craziness', 'undermined', 'comedy', 'sixth', 'season', 'were', 'highlights', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'crabby', 'Jesus', 'were', 'fewer', 'far', 'between.As', 'previous', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'quite', 'nice', 'extras', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'wish', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'roped', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'do', 'commentary', 'track', 'others', 'cast', 'Many', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'when', 'played', 'together', 'almost', 'play', 'mini-episodes', 'episode', 'themselves.I', 'still', 'really', 'dislike', 'packaging', 'show', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'wear', 'tear', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'other', 'season', 'sets', 'out', 'sixth', 'season', 'had', 'less', 'highlights', 'compared', 'previous', 'ones', 'season', 'still', 'strong', 'very', 'funny', 'episodes', 'Seventh', 'season', 'comparison', 'stumbles', 'drunk', 'room', 'full', 'toys', 'humor', 'was', 'highlight', 'previous', 'seasons', 'even', 'one']",N/A

The extras are excellent including the 25 minutes of bloopers.  The biggest negative is the packaging of the discs.  It's quite an annoyance getting them out and back in.  I really don't get why they packaged them like this.,4,Good but not the best.,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,344,"['own', 'seasons', 'Office', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'others', 'still', 'funniest', 'show', 'TV', 'extras', 'are', 'excellent', 'including', '25', 'minutes', 'bloopers', 'biggest', 'negative', 'packaging', 'discs', 'quite', 'annoyance', 'getting', 'out', 'back', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'packaged']",N/A
1279504,AP3B615GM191G,B002N5N5SO,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[34, 48]","In reviewing the sixth season of ""The Office"", there is good news and bad news: On the positive side, the season gave us such landmark episodes as ""Niagara Falls"" (Jim/Pam wedding) and ""The Arrival"" (Jim/Pam baby), easily in the top echelon of episodes in show history.  On the flip side, though, the show also went through two separate little dry patches that produced some episodes that just didn't measure up well against earlier efforts.The theme of ""change"" runs at the core of the entire season.  At the beginning, Dunder-Mifflin employees worry about the long-term stability of their company, then (about half way through the season), the company is actually bought out by Sabre, a printer company headed by Jo Bennett (guest star Kathy Bates), with the crew having to adjust to their new ownership.  On a more personal level, the Jim/Pam relationship moves from one of flirtation & fun to more real-life undertones (marriage, parenting, etc.), while two characters (Andy Bernard and new receptionist Erin) become smitten with each other...only to provide some of the most awkwardly hilarious conversations/situations in show history!In terms of acting, the sixth season was on par with the previous installments.  Steve Carrell as Michael Scott is still the glue that binds everything together, and the supporting cast keeps turning in hilarious performances when called upon.  The introduction of the Andy/Erin romance was a breath of fresh air for the show, as its innocence harkens back to the early Jim/Pam seasons, but due to Andy's total and absolute goofiness, it takes forever (but in a good way!) for things to really get off the ground.  About the only two things that got a little annoying were the continued Dwight/Angela battles that never seem to end, and Bates' new character, who doesn't seem to add much comedy to the show whatsoever.So, despite the fact that the episodes were a bit uneven in terms of overall quality/hilarity, I cannot drop this season below five stars due to the extraordinary content of the really good episodes.  Basically, the season started off a bit slow, hit its stride during/after the Jim/Pam wedding, then leveled off again after the baby episode, only to limp to the finish line.  Also, the final scene hints at the possible return of a fan-favorite character, which could easily rejuvenate the proceedings for the seventh season next fall.",5,"Despite Some Shakiness, Epic Episodes Continue The Greatness",1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,2395,"['reviewing', 'sixth', 'season', 'Office', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news', 'positive', 'side', 'season', 'gave', 'such', 'landmark', 'episodes', 'Niagara', 'Falls', 'Jim/Pam', 'wedding', 'Arrival', 'Jim/Pam', 'baby', 'easily', 'top', 'echelon', 'episodes', 'show', 'history', 'flip', 'side', 'though', 'show', 'also', 'went', 'two', 'separate', 'little', 'dry', 'patches', 'produced', 'episodes', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'well', 'earlier', 'efforts.The', 'theme', 'change', 'runs', 'core', 'entire', 'season', 'beginning', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'employees', 'worry', 'long-term', 'stability', 'company', 'then', 'way', 'season', 'company', 'actually', 'bought', 'out', 'Sabre', 'printer', 'company', 'headed', 'Jo', 'Bennett', 'guest', 'star', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'crew', 'having', 'adjust', 'new', 'ownership', 'more', 'personal', 'level', 'Jim/Pam', 'relationship', 'moves', 'one', 'flirtation', 'fun', 'more', 'real-life', 'undertones', 'marriage', 'parenting', 'etc', 'two', 'characters', 'Andy', 'Bernard', 'new', 'receptionist', 'Erin', 'become', 'smitten', 'other', 'only', 'provide', 'most', 'awkwardly', 'hilarious', 'conversations/situations', 'show', 'history', 'terms', 'acting', 'sixth', 'season', 'was', 'par', 'previous', 'installments', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'still', 'glue', 'everything', 'together', 'supporting', 'cast', 'keeps', 'turning', 'hilarious', 'performances', 'when', 'called', 'upon', 'introduction', 'Andy/Erin', 'romance', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'show', 'innocence', 'back', 'early', 'Jim/Pam', 'seasons', 'due', 'Andy', 'total', 'absolute', 'goofiness', 'forever', 'good', 'way', 'things', 'really', 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'got', 'little', 'annoying', 'were', 'continued', 'Dwight/Angela', 'never', 'seem', 'end', 'Bates', 'new', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'add', 'much', 'comedy', 'show', 'whatsoever.So', 'fact', 'episodes', 'were', 'bit', 'uneven', 'terms', 'overall', 'quality/hilarity', 'can', 'not', 'drop', 'season', 'five', 'stars', 'due', 'extraordinary', 'content', 'really', 'good', 'episodes', 'Basically', 'season', 'started', 'off', 'bit', 'slow', 'hit', 'stride', 'during/after', 'Jim/Pam', 'wedding', 'then', 'leveled', 'off', 'again', 'baby', 'episode', 'only', 'limp', 'finish', 'line', 'Also', 'final', 'scene', 'hints', 'possible', 'return', 'fan-favorite', 'character', 'could', 'easily', 'rejuvenate', 'proceedings', 'seventh', 'season', 'next', 'fall']",N/A
