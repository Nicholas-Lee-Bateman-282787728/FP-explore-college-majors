1197883,A2VYSDQ4Q7B2TC,B001GM6C44,Grace,"[5, 5]","I read ""Flowers for Algernon"" more than a few years ago, have seen ""Charly,"" and just read the short story version for the first time. I saw this adaptation when it came out on T.V., and as soon as it came out on DVD, I snatched it up and have seen the movie around 10 times since then. Needless to say, I love the story ""Flowers for Algernon,"" and I like this movie the most.Because it's a made-for-tv movie, it's not as polished-looking as bigger-budget movies, and timewise, could be longer for character development and to flesh out the story more. However, for what it is, the movie was very well done.I thought this ""Flowers"" made Charlie Gordon more sympathetic than both the Charlie in ""Charly"" and the book. This Charlie was more like the Charlie in the short story version, and I thought the writers made a good call by making him less aggressive and tragic than in the book and 1968 movie. They focused more on the sentimental themes without sacrificing the main theme of the relationship between intelligence and acceptance. For example, Charlie and Alice's relationship was realistic in the sense that we can see why Alice would like Charlie after the operation. In the book and the 1968 movie...those reasons were lost on me. The ending to this movie was also a perfect balance of sad and sweet, and continues to make you wonder long after the credits finish rolling.In addition, I would like to add that I thought all the actors were great in their roles, especially Kelli Williams. Her performance was very natural, with the perfect amount of depth and feeling. Matthew Modine was also good as Charlie, though sometimes I questioned his portrayal of a mentally impaired guy. In my opionion the actors who played his classmates did a better job of it. Also, a big chunk of cheese to the mouse that played Algernon. He was very good at being cute and super smart.Final thoughts: A movie you can watch over and over again, without getting tired of the themes, story, and characters. The movie does not drag at all; if anything I wish it were longer. Your heart can't help being captured by such a thought-provoking, emotional story.",5,"More Sentimental Message, More Heartwarming, Nothing Wrong With That!",1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,2145,"['read', 'Flowers', 'Algernon', 'more', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'seen', 'Charly', 'just', 'read', 'short', 'story', 'version', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'adaptation', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'T.V.', 'as', 'soon', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'snatched', 'up', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'around', '10', 'times', 'then', 'Needless', 'say', 'love', 'story', 'Flowers', 'Algernon', 'like', 'movie', 'most.Because', 'made-for-tv', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'polished-looking', 'bigger-budget', 'movies', 'timewise', 'could', 'be', 'longer', 'character', 'development', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'more', 'However', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done.I', 'thought', 'Flowers', 'made', 'Charlie', 'Gordon', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Charlie', 'Charly', 'book', 'Charlie', 'was', 'more', 'Charlie', 'short', 'story', 'version', 'thought', 'writers', 'made', 'good', 'call', 'making', 'less', 'aggressive', 'tragic', 'book', '1968', 'movie', 'focused', 'more', 'sentimental', 'themes', 'sacrificing', 'main', 'theme', 'relationship', 'intelligence', 'acceptance', 'example', 'Charlie', 'Alice', 'relationship', 'was', 'realistic', 'sense', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Alice', 'would', 'like', 'Charlie', 'operation', 'book', '1968', 'movie', 'reasons', 'were', 'lost', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'perfect', 'balance', 'sad', 'sweet', 'make', 'wonder', 'long', 'credits', 'finish', 'rolling.In', 'addition', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'thought', 'actors', 'were', 'great', 'roles', 'especially', 'Kelli', 'Williams', 'performance', 'was', 'very', 'natural', 'perfect', 'amount', 'depth', 'feeling', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'Charlie', 'sometimes', 'questioned', 'portrayal', 'mentally', 'impaired', 'guy', 'opionion', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'classmates', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'Also', 'big', 'chunk', 'cheese', 'mouse', 'played', 'Algernon', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'being', 'cute', 'super', 'smart.Final', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'getting', 'tired', 'themes', 'story', 'characters', 'movie', 'not', 'drag', 'anything', 'wish', 'were', 'longer', 'heart', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'captured', 'such', 'thought-provoking', 'emotional', 'story']",Flowers for Algernon
1197884,A2ULE2TYILL4BR,B001GM6C44,H2Steacher,"[4, 5]","This movie came out on CBS about 10 years ago, and I recorded it on VHS, complete with commercials and severe weather warnings (LA was being hit by thunderstorms that year). Since this version was far better than earlier movie adaptation (""Charly"" starring Cliff Robertson), I would show it to my Freshman class after we read the short story. It was always a hit with them, and I highly recommend this movie for any teacher who teaches ""Flowers"".  I'm just thrilled that it is now available in DVD, so I don't have to fast-forward through the commercials.As to why my Freshmen liked the movie: DVD is based on the novel, so it is just different enough from the short story as not to be a repeat of what we read. In fact, a ""Compare & Contrast"" handout is a frequent assignment when we view the movie. The acting is well done, from the leads (Modine and Williams) to the lesser parts (Dr. Strauss, Burt, and of course, Algernon). There was a good deal of humor with Charlie's classmates and Charlie's mispronunciation of the word ""genius"" (jean-ass) which kids laughed out. As for the ""sex scene"" that some reviewers objected to: sex is just alluded to; there is no actual nudity in the movie (It was, after all, originally broadcast on CBS). Kelli Williams wakes up from sleep and Audience sees her naked back as she turns to look at Modine. Yes, there were immature giggles (these are Freshmen), but nothing over-the-top. Again, it is up to each instructor whether or not to fast-forward this scene or not (maybe 5 seconds, if that).Great movie. Great price (Only $6!).

I cried during the book too, so I can't say I wasn't expecting it.  If you've read the book, you know what I'm talking about.  If you haven't read the book, please go read it before you watch this movie.  Sure you don't have to, but I would just highly recommend it for full viewing pleasure.Charlie is a person with developmental disabilities.  He spends his day between class and working at a bakery.  But then he is chosen for an experiment.  One that has great success when performed on laboratory mice.  But Charlie will be the first human and it will make a very profound effect on Charlie and those around him.Characters:Matthew Modine: Charlie GordonKelli Williams: Alice KinnianRon Rifkin: Dr. Jonah StraussCameron Bowen: Charlie as a childMatthew Modine does a fabulous job playing Charlie.  While his emotions are not quite as strong as in the book perhaps.  But he shows the progression from Charlie as mentally disabled to Charlie as a genius in a very convincing way.  It's hard not to like him.  Although I think Algernon the Mouse might have upstaged him a bit.  You can't really beat a cute mouse.  Williams as Miss Kinnian didn't get as large of a role.  As Charlie's teacher and friend she was important, but the movie focused more on him than it did on her.  She was nice, but didn't have as much substance as she could have.For those familiar with the book you won't notice too many differences.  Sure it deviates a bit, but most movies do.  I actually think this one did pretty well at keeping to original content.  And it brought a whole new level of emotion to be able to see everything in film version.  Those tissues were definitely needed, especially with some of the scenes with Algernon and a couple of the scenes between Alice and Charlie.  And the movie was paced fairly.  It didn't feel rushed to me.  Even though it had a lot of ground to cover and the time span was in months.  And I think it did have some lessons to impart, because it is really sad how people can treat others at time, especially if they're perceived as different.Since this wasn't a flashy film filled with special effects or feats of daring, it was shot pretty standard.  It actually reminded me of something more filmed in the 80's rather than 2001.  Not in a terrible way, but it just didn't seem quite that modern in terms of clothes and settings.  And the music was background music and didn't really have any time period or emotion tied to it.I really enjoyed this movie.  Almost as much as I did the book.  I would think that anyone who likes drama or the Flowers for Algernon story would probably appreciate it.Review by M.
