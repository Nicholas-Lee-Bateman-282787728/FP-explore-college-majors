987253,AO7RFXGXSY3LN,B000FBFYXM,"Amy Wallace ""Buttonsamy""","[230, 232]","If you are a fan of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, then you probably wondered what happened at the end of the last series. What happened to the characters after the show ended? How did Katie grow up? Were Colleen and Andrew happily married? Do Sully and Dr. Quinn have any more children? What about Cloud Dancing and Dorothy, Robert E. and Grace?I too, wondered those questions, until I discovered there were 2 Dr. Quinn movies that took place after the series had been cancelled. I quickly searched everywhere to get copies of them, only to find out they were being released on DVD a few months later.The first Dr. Quinn movie, referred to here as ""Dr. Quinn, the Movie"" is also known as ""Revolutions"". The film begins by bringing us back to Colorado Springs. We see Sully as an important figure on the town council, Dr. Mike still working hard to cure people, and Katie, now a little girl watching her mom at work. The town looks just the same, as do the characters. Just like in the series, a huge event happens; Katie is kiddnapped! Dr. Mike and Sully have to follow her kiddnappers into Mexico, where most of the movie takes place. The settings are beautiful, (mainly filmed in Malibu Creek State Park and Paramount Ranch, in different locations than the series took place) Its riviting and the storyline is MUCH more complex than any stories that took place in the TV series. This was my favorite of the two films.The second Dr. Quinn movie, ""The Heart Within"" follows up on Dr. Mike's family in Boston. Brian is a man now (he grew up beautifully, and sooo handsome!) and Colleen and her husband, Dr. Andrew Cook struggle to get Colleen's opinions accepted at Harvard Medical School. Like her mother, Colleen must also fight the prejudice of men as a woman doctor. She must also face Andrew Cook's father, a professor at Harvard. Dr. Quinn's mother is having heart troubles, and needs an experimental surgury to recover, but will it be worth it? Brian sets out to impress his family, and proove he is finally a man. This is a fabulous film, and really brings back what was so important in the TV series, morals, judgements and values, and teaching the difference between right and wrong. I thought that seeing Boston again was wonderful, the sets are amazing, as are the costumes. Dr Quinn has a BEAUTIFUL victorian bustled gown made up of GOLD satins and silks, and Sully is gorgeous in formalwear. Many people think this film was the better of the two, but I thought it left too many loose ends.These movies are a must for any fan of the series. The characters are still just as memorable as they were through the series, and its a perfect wa to say goodbye to the end of the Dr. Quinn era. I never felt like the season 6 finale was enough, and the actors had no idea that the show was being cancelled; everyone anticipated comming back for a season 7. The two films satisfied my need to say goodbye to the characters, and answered some of my questions. I think these films were well done, for being made so long after the series had been cancelled. They are worth the money!",5,Finally!

987284,A1FSZ2GKH2THBT,B000FBFYXM,"Penni Fields ""smlchng56""","[51, 53]","I have been a fan of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman (DQMW) since it first aired in 1993 on CBS. I watched every single episode and now own them all on DVD.  I was so happy to see that the movies that were made after the show went off the air were released as well on DVD.  I loved Revolutions aka Dr Quinn The Movie. It has lots of Sully (Joe Lando)!! The premise of this movie is that Katie, the Sully's young daughter is kidnapped because Sully wouldn't vote a certain way for a copper mining group. With the help of Cloud Dancing, Sully and Dr. Mike find a wagon that was in an accident and fear that Katie has been killed.  Dr. Mike blames Sully for not warning them that by not voting for the copper mine he put their family, especially their daughter, in danger. They are all very sad after burying the little girl they found.  But good news comes when word that there were two girls Katie's age traveling that day and a girl who favored Katie was seen with people in Mexico.  After an autopsy performed by Dr. Quinn confirms the dead girl isn't Katie, they and their son Brian Cooper, and others from the series (town), Jake Slicker, Robert E., Horace Bing, and Cloud Dancing go to Mexico to get Katie back.  They run into difficulties together and individually, but Sully and Robert E. save the day. This movie has it's usual wonderful cinematogrophy and historic mentions like the series did. It is a good adventure movie with a little bit of romance tied in for good measure.  The Heart Within is the second movie on this DVD. It was written by the creator of the series DQMW, Beth Sullivan. In this movie, Michaela, Sully, Katie, and Brian are traveling by train to Boston for Colleen's graduation from Harvard. She lives there now with her husband, Dr. Andrew Cook. When they arrive in Boston, they are greeted by Dr. Mike's sister Rebecca who informs the group that Mrs. Quinn, their mother, is sick in the hospital. As luck would have it, Mrs. Quinn is released to go home as long as she doesn't over do it.  She has been diagnosed with a heart condition. Again, as in the series, there are subplots throughout the movie. One is some men try to bribe Sully to help them do bad stuff. Another is Brian, who wants to be a reporter, is offered a job at the Boston Globe. And another is the prejudice that Colleen faces for being a woman and receiving the highest grade on the test to become a doctor. Sadly, Mrs. Quinn dies in this movie (Beth had a history of killing characters even when the series was on.)  She leaves her money to her daughter Michaela so that she can build her dream hospital in Colorado Springs, and she leaves money to Colleen so that she and her husband can have their own medical practice in Boston. This movie wasn't as adventurous as Revolutions, but it had it's own moments when Sully let those bad business men know what he thought about their bribe and their threats! All in all, if you are a fan of this show, then you will like the movies.  Unfortunately, The Heart Within doesn't have many of the original townsfolk in it like Revolutions does, but it is still great to see the Sully family once again. I wish there were more.",5,DQMW The Movies,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,3165,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'Medicine', 'Woman', 'DQMW', 'first', 'aired', '1993', 'CBS', 'watched', 'single', 'episode', 'now', 'own', 'DVD', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'show', 'went', 'air', 'were', 'released', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'loved', 'Revolutions', 'aka', 'Dr', 'Quinn', 'Movie', 'lots', 'Sully', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'premise', 'movie', 'Katie', 'Sully', 'young', 'daughter', 'kidnapped', 'Sully', 'would', ""n't"", 'vote', 'certain', 'way', 'copper', 'mining', 'group', 'help', 'Cloud', 'Dancing', 'Sully', 'Dr.', 'Mike', 'find', 'wagon', 'was', 'accident', 'fear', 'Katie', 'been', 'killed', 'Dr.', 'Mike', 'Sully', 'not', 'warning', 'not', 'voting', 'copper', 'mine', 'put', 'family', 'especially', 'daughter', 'danger', 'are', 'very', 'sad', 'burying', 'little', 'girl', 'found', 'good', 'news', 'when', 'word', 'were', 'two', 'girls', 'Katie', 'age', 'traveling', 'day', 'girl', 'who', 'favored', 'Katie', 'was', 'seen', 'people', 'Mexico', 'autopsy', 'performed', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'dead', 'girl', ""n't"", 'Katie', 'son', 'Brian', 'Cooper', 'others', 'series', 'town', 'Jake', 'Slicker', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Horace', 'Bing', 'Cloud', 'Dancing', 'go', 'Mexico', 'get', 'Katie', 'back', 'run', 'difficulties', 'together', 'individually', 'Sully', 'Robert', 'E.', 'save', 'day', 'movie', 'usual', 'wonderful', 'cinematogrophy', 'historic', 'mentions', 'series', 'did', 'good', 'adventure', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'romance', 'tied', 'good', 'measure', 'Heart', 'Within', 'second', 'movie', 'DVD', 'was', 'written', 'creator', 'series', 'DQMW', 'Beth', 'Sullivan', 'movie', 'Michaela', 'Sully', 'Katie', 'Brian', 'are', 'traveling', 'train', 'Boston', 'Colleen', 'graduation', 'Harvard', 'there', 'now', 'husband', 'Dr.', 'Andrew', 'Cook', 'When', 'arrive', 'Boston', 'are', 'greeted', 'Dr.', 'Mike', 'sister', 'Rebecca', 'who', 'group', 'Mrs.', 'Quinn', 'mother', 'sick', 'hospital', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Mrs.', 'Quinn', 'released', 'go', 'home', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'over', 'do', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'heart', 'condition', 'Again', 'series', 'are', 'subplots', 'movie', 'One', 'men', 'try', 'bribe', 'Sully', 'help', 'do', 'bad', 'stuff', 'Brian', 'who', 'be', 'reporter', 'offered', 'job', 'Boston', 'Globe', 'prejudice', 'Colleen', 'being', 'woman', 'receiving', 'highest', 'grade', 'test', 'become', 'doctor', 'Sadly', 'Mrs.', 'Quinn', 'movie', 'Beth', 'had', 'history', 'killing', 'characters', 'even', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'money', 'daughter', 'Michaela', 'can', 'build', 'dream', 'hospital', 'Colorado', 'Springs', 'money', 'Colleen', 'so', 'husband', 'can', 'have', 'own', 'medical', 'practice', 'Boston', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'adventurous', 'Revolutions', 'had', 'own', 'moments', 'when', 'Sully', 'let', 'bad', 'business', 'men', 'know', 'what', 'thought', 'bribe', 'threats', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'then', 'will', 'like', 'movies', 'Unfortunately', 'Heart', 'Within', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'original', 'townsfolk', 'Revolutions', 'still', 'great', 'see', 'Sully', 'family', 'once', 'again', 'wish', 'were', 'more']",N/A

And they are by no means a complete loss! The actors do a great job with what they're given, and the scenery is beautiful, and we get to watch many of our favorite characters for about four hours.So why only 3 stars? Not as good as the series, that's why.The first movie (Revolutions) doesn't feel like Dr. Quinn--it's much more gritty western. On the positive side, we get to see some of the townsfolk. When young Katie is kidnapped, Jake, Horace, Robert E., and Cloud Dancing join Sully, Dr. Mike, and Brian on the rescue party. On the downside, we see nothing of Matthew or Hank, and the music isn't at all the same as the Dr. Quinn series, and some continuity elements just don't line up. Where's Jake's wife, Teresa (and the children we hoped they'd have?) What about the baby Grace & Robert E. were expecting by the end of the series? If you like your DQMW for action/adventure, you'll probably like this, but if you like your characters deeply explored, it will leave you wanting.The second movie (The Heart Within, on the positive side, better uses the characters and remembers the histories, with only a few major glitches. The music is back, as is Beth Sullivan as a writer, all of which are good things. On the downside, we see NOTHING of the townsfolk, as the entirety of the action is in Boston. And those glitches? Andrew's parents, whom we learned in the last episode of the series were dead, are alive and well with no mention of the discrepancy and, again, Matthew is wholly missing. The ending bothered me too, so here comes the spoiler warning:SPOILER: By the end of the movie, Colleen, Andrew, and Brian are all settled in Boston. The final shot is of Dr. Mike in the train going back to Colorado, with Sully and Katie, a tear trickling down her cheek. Seriously? Why couldn't Brian and the Drs.
