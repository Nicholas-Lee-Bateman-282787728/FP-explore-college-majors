225081,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300247090,Acute Observer,"[6, 21]","The film begins when a man buys a mug, then bicycles to a cow pasture. A few years earlier this had been a busy US Air Force B-17 bomber airfield. Then we return to the early days of WW II. A damaged B-17 lands roughly with its combat wounded. Spare planes will arrive, and their next mission will be to fly at 9,000 feet to bomb St. Nazaire and its submarine pens. This lower height results in more accuracy and then fewer missions. [Bombers are long-distance artillery.] Some in the group think they have a jinx for bad luck. [Or at the low end of the learning curve?] No plan is perfect, there is always the unexpected. The film shows how good management can handle problems. Daylight precision bombing is the key to winning the war. It is about production, destroying enemy factories results in a loss of supplies and a less effective armed force. The final target was the ball-bearing factories, the critical part for any mechanical armed force.A new general starts by enforcing the rules. Visitors will be checked, men will be in uniform and on post; no more slacking off. It's a war, maximum effort is required. General Frank Savage challenges his men to perform better. They should stop worrying about dying and accept the fact some men will die; life will be easier. They will perform better when they have pride in themselves. The best defense against enemy fighters is to fly in close formation so each airplane can defend the others. Any bomber that drops out of formation is likely doomed. These new rules result in better morale and good luck. [The result of more training and experience.] Now men want to sneak aboard to take part in these missions.The last part of the film shows actual battle scenes from both sides, and the casualties. Gunners are told to use short bursts to save ammunition. Their bombs are dropped when they reach their target. One bomber takes a direct hit and explodes in the air. Others are damaged and fall behind. Enemy fighters are shot down. At the end General Savage suffers from burn out, the result of ""maximum effort"". Everyone has a breaking point, man or machine. The ending shows 19 of 21 bombers returning, a heavy 9% loss. [The later use of long-distance fighters like the P-51 reduced losses.]This drama is unusual in being primarily about the control and management of a military force (a specialized form of business management). Few films made during WW II are now shown on TV since the 1970s. You can compare this to ""A Walk in the Sun"" for its point of view. While ""Frank Savage"" is fictional, there was a reference to ""Kirk May""; that could be the real Curtis LeMay. The Strategic Air Command (STRAC?) of the 1950s was a monument to the Air Force, but also massive inefficiency in preparing for a war that never happened. One fault in this film is its worship of authoritarianism, a Great Leader who can do no wrong. Wasn't this what we were fighting? The peace-time draft did two things: it soaked up men to keep unemployment down, and worked to support American hegemony after the defeat of the Axis powers and the declining colonial powers. It provided brain-washing of a generation to a military point of view. [Lately the anti-gun nuts are claiming a .50 caliber rifle could shoot down a jet airplane. This film shows .50 caliber machine guns firing at slower propeller-driven airplanes and mostly missing. They usually needed the combined fire from many machine guns to damage enemy fighters.]For a history of the B-17 four-engine bomber read Martin Caidin's ""Flying Forts"" or ""Black Thursday"".",3,War as a Deadly Business,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,3560,"['film', 'when', 'man', 'mug', 'then', 'cow', 'pasture', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'had', 'been', 'busy', 'US', 'Air', 'Force', 'B-17', 'bomber', 'airfield', 'Then', 'return', 'early', 'days', 'WW', 'II', 'damaged', 'B-17', 'roughly', 'combat', 'wounded', 'Spare', 'planes', 'will', 'arrive', 'next', 'mission', 'will', 'be', 'fly', '9,000', 'feet', 'bomb', 'St.', 'Nazaire', 'submarine', 'pens', 'lower', 'height', 'results', 'more', 'accuracy', 'then', 'fewer', 'missions', '[', 'Bombers', 'are', 'long-distance', 'artillery', ']', 'group', 'think', 'have', 'jinx', 'bad', 'luck', '[', 'low', 'end', 'learning', 'curve', 'plan', 'perfect', 'always', 'unexpected', 'film', 'how', 'good', 'management', 'can', 'handle', 'problems', 'Daylight', 'precision', 'bombing', 'key', 'winning', 'war', 'production', 'destroying', 'enemy', 'factories', 'results', 'loss', 'supplies', 'less', 'effective', 'armed', 'force', 'final', 'target', 'was', 'ball-bearing', 'factories', 'critical', 'part', 'mechanical', 'armed', 'force.A', 'new', 'general', 'starts', 'enforcing', 'rules', 'Visitors', 'will', 'be', 'checked', 'men', 'will', 'be', 'uniform', 'post', 'more', 'slacking', 'off', 'war', 'maximum', 'effort', 'required', 'General', 'Frank', 'Savage', 'men', 'perform', 'better', 'should', 'stop', 'worrying', 'dying', 'accept', 'fact', 'men', 'will', 'die', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'easier', 'will', 'perform', 'better', 'when', 'have', 'pride', 'best', 'defense', 'enemy', 'fighters', 'fly', 'close', 'formation', 'airplane', 'can', 'defend', 'others', 'bomber', 'formation', 'likely', 'doomed', 'new', 'rules', 'result', 'better', 'morale', 'good', 'luck', '[', 'result', 'more', 'training', 'experience', ']', 'Now', 'men', 'want', 'sneak', 'aboard', 'take', 'part', 'missions.The', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'actual', 'battle', 'scenes', 'sides', 'casualties', 'Gunners', 'are', 'told', 'use', 'short', 'bursts', 'save', 'ammunition', 'bombs', 'are', 'dropped', 'when', 'reach', 'target', 'One', 'bomber', 'direct', 'hit', 'explodes', 'air', 'Others', 'are', 'damaged', 'fall', 'behind', 'Enemy', 'fighters', 'are', 'shot', 'down', 'end', 'General', 'Savage', 'suffers', 'burn', 'out', 'result', 'maximum', 'effort', 'Everyone', 'breaking', 'point', 'man', 'machine', 'ending', '19', '21', 'bombers', 'returning', 'heavy', '9', '%', 'loss', '[', 'later', 'use', 'long-distance', 'fighters', 'P-51', 'reduced', 'losses', ']', 'drama', 'unusual', 'being', 'primarily', 'control', 'management', 'military', 'force', 'specialized', 'form', 'business', 'management', 'Few', 'films', 'made', 'WW', 'II', 'are', 'now', 'shown', 'TV', '1970s', 'can', 'compare', 'Walk', 'Sun', 'point', 'view', 'Frank', 'Savage', 'fictional', 'was', 'reference', 'Kirk', 'May', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'Curtis', 'LeMay', 'Strategic', 'Air', 'Command', 'STRAC', '1950s', 'was', 'monument', 'Air', 'Force', 'also', 'massive', 'inefficiency', 'preparing', 'war', 'never', 'happened', 'One', 'fault', 'film', 'worship', 'authoritarianism', 'Great', 'Leader', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'Was', ""n't"", 'what', 'were', 'fighting', 'peace-time', 'draft', 'did', 'two', 'things', 'soaked', 'up', 'men', 'keep', 'unemployment', 'down', 'worked', 'support', 'American', 'hegemony', 'defeat', 'Axis', 'powers', 'declining', 'colonial', 'powers', 'provided', 'brain-washing', 'generation', 'military', 'point', 'view', 'Lately', 'anti-gun', 'nuts', 'are', 'claiming', '.50', 'caliber', 'rifle', 'could', 'shoot', 'down', 'jet', 'airplane', 'film', '.50', 'caliber', 'machine', 'firing', 'slower', 'propeller-driven', 'airplanes', 'mostly', 'missing', 'usually', 'needed', 'combined', 'fire', 'many', 'machine', 'guns', 'damage', 'enemy', 'fighters', ']', 'history', 'B-17', 'four-engine', 'bomber', 'read', 'Martin', 'Caidin', 'Flying', 'Forts', 'Black', 'Thursday']",Twelve O'clock High VHS

225086,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6300247090,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[2, 3]","This is a magnificent World War II film about U.S. airmen stationed in Britain in the fall of 1942, and so much more; it's about the psychology that goes into situations of extreme stress, and what makes a man a winner or loser when put to the test. As General Savage (Peck) says in his pep talk, &quot;fear is normal, but stop worrying about it&quot;. Savage has no time for self pity, for himself or anyone else, and his toughness and high principles bring out the best in his men, and it also points up the dangers of emotional attachment in the wrong situations.The script by Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay Jr., from their book which is loosely based on a true story, is intelligent and insightful, and the direction by Henry King meticulous. The cinematography by Leon Shamroy is crisp and marvelous, and also includes riveting portions of actual WWII battle footage interspersed in the aerial shots.The Alfred Newman score also adds much to the film.Gregory Peck is perfect as General Savage, fabulously handsome, with one of the greatest voices of the 20th century, one cannot imagine a better actor for the part. Dean Jagger is also splendid as Major Harvey Stovall; wise and often witty, it is through his eyes that we see the story, told in flashback as he wanders the deserted airfield in 1949.Other excellent performances come from Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe, but every cast member is good, with strong turns from all.Nominated for a Best Actor and Best Picture Oscar (losing out to &quot;All the King's Men&quot; on both counts), &quot;Twelve O'Clock High&quot; spawned a much better than average TV series (1964-67) that I enjoyed watching, especially in its first season when it starred Robert Lansing.This is a film that is actually used in &quot;leadership seminars&quot; for business executives, and by the U.S. Airforce as a teaching tool.

The human cost of war, and its effect on human beings is what elevates this film.  The film is not simply we won and they lost, the humanity is what really mattered in the end.

How do you get men to face terror and death in the skies day after day?  What does leading and losing men you've come to know do to you?Not really a combat film (the airborne raid depicted comes late in the film) it nonetheless is one of the best films ever made delineating subtely and surely what the terror and stress of combat does to men.Simply put, I agree with my fellow reviewers that this is one of the best war films ever made.  The B&amp;W photogaphy, as is so often the case, makes the film all the more real, locating it in it's time and place.  The dialogue excellent, the emotions and conflicts real.  Thank God they didn't throw in some romance or other distraction.This is a story of how men work together, argue, disagree, but get on with it.  It shows the resolve to get the job done, but also the underlying comraderie, care and sacrifice necessary to acclompish seeming impossible tasks.I always think of the tenderness shown in the last scene when Gary Merrill, who got bounced and whose job was taken by Peck's Gen.

225096,ACC1SLND21RI6,6300247090,Breyel,"[2, 2]","I give high marks to the script of ""12 O'clock High"". This B&W; film made in 1949 explores with compassion the psychological  breaking point of the pilots in Squadron 918, one of the first American outfits to conduct daylight bombing raids over occupied Europe and Nazi Germany. I suppose if it were re-made today, this wonderful script would be diluted in favour of more action scenes.Of course, the film has that too. Actual aerial footage from the archives of the German Luftwaffe and American Army Air Corp are woven into the film. The B-24s and Luftwaffe fighters obviously add raw energy, but they do not overshadow the story of how the battles, the deaths affected the morale of the men.Gregory Peck and Dean Jagger portray this to great effect. In fact, had they delivered less than convincing performances, ""12 O'clock High's"" story of these brave airman would probably have been relegated to some dusty back shelf.

There are two stand out performances by Gregory Peck as Brig. Gen. Frank Savage and Dean Jagger as Maj. Harvey Stovall. The rest of the cast is very good and carry off their parts well, but Peck and Jagger are the movie. Their conversations and Jagger's narration through the movie as he reflects back on what happened after the war while visiting the old haunts is as good as it gets in this kind of drama. This is typically in most peoples top ten of WWII movies. Black and White movies may not appeal to some but the contrast can sometimes give an interesting perspective and add to the mood and give it a historical feel. The action is fairly intense sometimes because they used actual aerial war footage and the radio chatter although probably taped is realistic.

225102,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6300247090,C. O. DeRiemer,"[7, 7]","This has got to be one of the best movies based on the WWII experience. The story line is simple. A U. S. bomber group based in England is taking too many losses flying daylight runs against the Germans. It's failing to achieve the results it should and morale is drifting down. It could infect other bombing groups. The commanding officer is replaced by a tough-minded, no nonsense brigadier general who is utterly dedicated to winning the war. He uses harsh tactics, discipline and grinding practice to transform what was close to being a group of losers into an effective, cohesive force. The cost to the war effort was worth it; the cost to him was too high. Gregory Peck plays Brigadier General Frank Savage in one of his best performances. The movie itself is almost unrelentingly grim until we realize that the group is coming through, even as we see Savage begin to break apart.The point of the film is summed up in two speeches. The first is by Major General Ben Pritchard (Millard Mitchell) to Savage as he tells him why he's going to replace Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill), a man they both respect, with Savage. ""We're fighting all over the world. Every theater commander is screaming for crews and equipment...Our problem right now narrows down to one group. If the 918th folds it can spread to the other three groups. It can fold the whole deal...I guess I don't have to tell you what's coming, Frank. I'm going to have to ask you to take nice young boys and fly them until they can't stand it, then to take them out, put them back in and fly them again. We've got to try to find out just what a maximum effort is...""Savage takes command and moves to impose his will and standards on the group. One of his first actions is to call the air crews together to tell them to suck it up. ""I don't have a lot of patience,"" he says. ""with this 'what are we fighting for' stuff. We're in a war, a shooting was. We've got to fight. And some of us have got to die. Now I'm not telling you not to be afraid. Fear is normal. Stop worrying about it...and yourselves. Stop making plans. Forget about going home. Consider yourselves already dead. Once you accept that idea it won't be so tough.""We're 30 minutes into the movie before Savage takes over. All that time has been spent establishing the situation, getting to know the crews and what they go through every time they fly and survive a mission. And, through Pritchard, what the bigger issues are. Once Savage takes over, however, the movie focuses on Savage and the men, the way he deals with them, the standards he insists on, the techniques he uses to shame or force them to accept what they must do.The movie climax begins with their first bombing run over Germany. The sequence takes about 20 minutes and is built up of actual aerial combat footage and realistic staged scenes. There's no music. All we have is the muffled drone of the engines, flak blossoming and German fighters diving through the bomber formations. One by one bombers are hit and go down. Some of the crews can be seen bailing out, sometimes they don't make it. The formation keeps going toward the target. It's a harrowing sequence.This is a tough minded movie. It has none of the Hollywood patriotic bombast exemplified by all those WWII John Wayne movies (as good as some of them are) or the Hollywood post traumatic stress syndrome exemplified by many of the Viet Nam films. It simply shows without too much preaching what happened to a WWII bomber group that started to fall apart and then was brought back up, and shows what happened to the men.This is a first-rate film. The DVD transfer (the movie was filmed in black and white) looks very good.

While there are some powerful air battle scenes in the movie, most of it takes place in officer's quarters and on the airbase in England.I think Gregory Peck gives one of his best performances as General Savage.  He is an officer who cares for his men, but cannot show it.  He pushes his mean to keep them safe and flies with them more than he should.  Eventually, despite putting on the exterior of the fearless, motivated airman and the kind of tough leader he believes his men need, the emotions he has repressed manifest themselves in a rather shocking way.The men under him have their own struggles with wanting to serve, but realizing all the friends they have lost in order to drop bombs on things that don't really do much to change the war.  They want out of the air service, particularly out from under Savage; yet they fly.Dean Jagger is spectacular as Major Stovall and won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for this role in 1949.

Set in the 1943 when the US Army Air Force was fighting to establish a credible air offensive against Germany; high losses and operational tempo have taken their toll on the airmen of the 918th Bomb Group.  The 8th Air Force commander sacks the bomb group's leader and brings in General Savage (Gregory Peck) to reverse their downward spiral before it infects the rest of the groups.The human factor in this picture is remarkable as General Savage pushes the group hard to regain its composure while the war continues to consume men and airplanes.  Gregory Peck is tremendous in his portrayal and the supporting cast provides an excellent variety of characters.  While intense, the story is balanced with a good amount of humor and personal triumph as the airmen climb out of their slump.  Particular highlights are the group adjutant Major Stovall (Dean Jagger) who keeps matters in perspective with a certain amount of wit; Savage's driver (Robert Arthur) who is busted and promoted repeatedly; and malingering pilot Lieutenant Colonel Gately (Hugh Marlowe) who rises to the occasion.  Center-stage remains with Savage however, dealing with the stress of command during a grim period of the Air Force's history, providing some very interesting insights on leadership.Wrapped around this human drama are production sets with authentic B-17s and airfields that look like the real thing.  While there's more drama on the ground than in the air, the movie does portray a bombing mission with actual combat footage, and there's a spectacular B-17 emergency landing sequence at the beginning of the film.Probably the best film about airmen in World War II and my personal favorite among the ""bomber"" flicks.If you like this one, you'll like the 1943 documentary ""Memphis Belle.""

Their roles reflect their own personality, rather than the characters.  Sadly, I think of lot of good acting has been given off-the-cuff reviews.  Peck's body of work speaks for itself, From 'To Kill a Mockingbird' to 'Guns of Navarone' - and all the deft works between - he has proved his class as an actor, as a screen legend.Twelve O'clock high is a very moving film.  It's in B&amp;W, and I think personally, the film benefits from this.  It gives you the grim realities of sending young men out to die and the men who shoulder that decisions.  There are bigger epics - like the air shows of 'The Battle of Britain' or the tank saga of 'The Battle of the Bulge', but I don't think any film can really touch the power of this film.  It does not deal with the battles, but the men.  It is a quiet film that address the pressures men face, the ones going out there and fighting, the ones that stay behind and give the orders.  It is bloody brilliant!Gregory Peck stars as Brig. Gen. Frank Savage.  At the start of the film, he is dealing with the Lt. Col. Ben R. Gately played by the underrated and very natural actor, Hugh Marlowe.  Gately is very popular with his men, because he cares.  Each time he sends them out and they do not come back, his heart bleeds.  Slowly the grim guilt is grinding him down.  Savage sees his friend's problems as one of distancing himself from the men.  If you stay aloof, do not get involved with them personally, the decisions would come easier.  When Savage voices this opinion once too often, he is told to put his money with his mouth is - he is to take over for the cracking Gately.Savage arrives.  Immediately he is in the untenable position of being he replacement for the much beloved Gately.  His by-the-book, shut up and salute, does not earn him adoration.  In fact, the whole unit has all written transfer requests.  Standing between the martinet Savage and is men who would like to frag him, is Maj. Harvey Stovall (Dean Jones in one of his best performances of his career).  Stovall was very devoted to Gately, but sees both sides of the problem and truly understands the bottom line - unless you are totally without a heart, there is NO way to keep the emotional distance from your men.  Eventually, the line is blurred and you care.  Something Savage slowly learns, and grinds him down just as Gately did.It's brilliantly written, with incisive insight that is marvelously flesh out by powerhouse actors that give it their all.A deeply moving film with so much heart.Just a note - Robert Lansing played the same character for the television series of that name and did equal justice to the role.

The film opens with a very sentimental scene by Dean Jagger when he revisits the old airfield after the war. From there everything flashes back. The entire entry for Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) is well set up. What emerges immediately is a depiction of the stress involved with life and death decision-making.It's very symbolic and ironic that Peck (as Savage) is involved in the decision that places Savage in the stress pressure cooker of the leadership of a B-17 squadron. Even the best of leaders will not always speak up to replace a friend and the enter the same position that they leveled criticism against.Changing attitudes, improving tactics and training, etc., is met with challenges and resistance by many who were loyal to the previous leadership. Peck is very convincing in this role as a straight talking goal oriented leader.The most accurate part of the movie is when Savage himself also feels thestress of command that the previous leader endured.

In virtually every aspect except photography and sound ""Twelve O'Clock High"" is superior.  The script by Sy  Bartlett in particular is vastly superior.Spielberg's film focused on  some of the command problems faced by Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) in  fulfilling his combat mission, but the treatment and development were  almost high schoolish (if I may) compared to the enthralling delineation in  ""Twelve O'Clock High.""  The problems encountered by Gregory Peck as the  bomber group commander were complex, subtle and psychologically demanding,  while the resolution was filled with the kind of male social and political  dynamics not much explored at the movies these days.  (We have female  dynamics aplenty.)Director Henry King's clean, crisp, ""invisible""  direction was also superior to the uneven and far too showy pandering from  Spielberg.  Furthermore the acting, with Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe  supporting Peck, was also better.  Ted Danson in his cameo and Matt Damon  at times in ""Saving Private Ryan"" were almost laughable.Comparing the  two movies makes one wonder how much movies really have improved.  Technically they have in every respect, but too often today's film-makers  think they can get by with special effects and splashy sets.  Pour a lot of  blood, show a lot of skin, get people at each other's throat, and it will  play, seems to be the attitude.  What is often forgotten are the two most  important aspects of film, namely, story and character development.

He discovers a cheap, ceramic antique which the store owner tells him is of little value. ""Value?"" replies the lawyer. ""Wrap it very carefully"" he adds. So begins his mental journey back in time to the English airstrip where he served as adjutant of the 918th (nine, eighteenth) Bomb Group.This ""hard luck"" group is taken over by a brigadier general from a colonel who has ""over-identified"" with his men, thus putting them before his missions. The general, Frank Savage, must restore group discipline and performance before the group disintegrates as an effective fighting unit.General Savage puts mission before men and turns the disgruntled men who despise him into a cohesive unit. They turn into a group that will do anything to keep from being left behind, or letting down their new leader. (Each announcement of a mission for the following day is characterized by the operations officer going to the mantel over the fireplace, in the Officers' Club, and turning the head of a ceramic pirate face outward.)But the tough general will not make the same mistake that the last group commander makes. He will always keep the mission first, and will not over-identify with his men. He will not let the loss of his men affect him.Or, will he?This black & white story is exceptional and superbly acted. It shows the mental tug-of-war a leader must make in the decisions that will cost the lives of men he has come to admire and respect.

Although this movie makes the viewer keenly aware of the horrors of combat and its effect on people, it does not actually depict things the gory detail so common today. This is a great movie - perhaps the best war movie ever - and it is good mainly because of its fabulous cast and clever, insightful script.Twelve O'Clock High is about a struggling squadron of American precision air bombers in Europe. After their benevolent, compassionate commander (Gary Merrill) cracks under the stress of having to send young men up to die, the normally understanding and reasonable General Savage (Gregory Peck) is called in to take over. In order to restore the morale of the group and instill them with pride and honor, Savage becomes incredibly strict and works the group very hard - which leads to some astonishing successes. But before long, the stress of leadership begins to get to Savage as well...Anyhow, this is a very exciting movie! It even uses actual footage from WWII airplane battles.

A few of these movies dealt with the real issues of the human mind and leadership.  Such WWII films as &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, &quot;Stalag 17&quot; and &quot;Twelve O'Clock High&quot; actually dealt with the human factor and how their actions affected those around them.Twelve O'Clock High is one of the greatest WWII dramas ever made. This story is timeless and leaves an everlasting effect on us because it deals with people (we can all relate to these situations and our ability to cope or deal with them).This film deals with; Leadership, Responsibility, Loyalty and Honor.  All these factors affect all of us and how we deal with our ability to perform and navigate through life.Summary:  United States early involvement in WWII started in England (late 1942).  We had B17 Bomber Squadrons involved in a new strategy, &quot;Daylight Precision Bombing&quot;.  This was a very critical and costly tactic.  There were high losses of men and bombers.  Morale was at its lowest point and the Leadership roles were in jeopardy.  The current Commanding Officer Colonel Davenport (Gary Merrill - excellent) was a very popular people person &amp; was totally committed to his men.  Because of his inability to successfully complete his squadrons missions was relieved by General Savage (Gregory Peck - Outstanding performance).  Savage believed in the mission, training and Lead by example Commanding Officer. This caused resentment from his pilots &amp; crews and the long uphill battle to make the squadron successful begins.This DVD has excellent Black &amp; White picture quality.

225138,A1345VRK5MYG7,6300247090,James L.,"[0, 0]","Gregory Peck stars as a general sent in to replace Gary Merrill, another general of a failing daylight bombing group.  Merrill has become too close to his men, clouding his judgment and allowing the men to view themselves as the &quot;hard luck&quot; squad.  Peck decides to take a very different approach.  He plays it tough, wants everyone whipped into shape, expects nothing but the best, and hopes that by eventually restoring a sense of pride after some successful missions, the men will come around.  Needless to say, the men resent him and his approach, transfer requests pour in, and it becomes questionable whether Peck's strategy can work.  Peck is outstanding as the general, a perfect choice for the role.  Merrill and Hugh Marlowe both give unusually strong performances, and Dean Jagger as a Major working in the office, delivers a subtle, humourous, and very intelligent performance that helps to anchor the film for the viewer.  Although there are some good action sequences, this film isn't about the action of the War.  It's about leadership and building pride, and it could apply to any organization.

Savage inherits a bomber squadron that has fallen upon a streak of bad luck.  The bombers are falling victim to the enemy and they are not hitting their target.  Gen. Savage comes in, whips the pilots and crews into shape, end of story.While the plot is nothing special, the movie is absolutely brilliant.  Despite the movie being set in the military, character of Gen. Savage is universal and timeless.Gen. Savage replaces a friend of his as the commanding officer of the 918th Bomber Group.  What makes this movie so different than other war movies is that the movie focuses on the chess game Gen. Savage has to play to get the bomber group to operate effectively with no casualties.  At first glance, there is no easy answer as to why the bomber group is not doing well.  The movie revolves around Gen. Savage picking the organization apart to find the problems.  As Gen. Savage implements changes to fix the issues, he is met with heavy resistance from his own men.  A majority of the movie is dedicated to how Gen. Savage implements the changes in the bomber group.This movie is about strategy.  It is not about the strategy of war, but rather the strategy and the problems encountered when trying to implement organizational change.  While the move would not be as exciting, the role of Gen. Savage could as easily been a CEO or any person who overseas people.I highly recommend this movie to anyone that has to supervise people.  It is great to see a war movie that focuses on the ""behind the scenes"" issues rather than the death and violence of the battlefield.",5,Absolutely Brilliant,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,1692,"['movie', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'set', 'World', 'War', '2', 'first', 'glance', 'story', 'line', 'commonly', 'Hollywood', 'Gen.', 'Savage', 'bomber', 'squadron', 'fallen', 'streak', 'bad', 'luck', 'bombers', 'are', 'falling', 'victim', 'enemy', 'are', 'not', 'hitting', 'target', 'Gen.', 'Savage', 'pilots', 'crews', 'shape', 'end', 'story.While', 'plot', 'nothing', 'special', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'being', 'set', 'military', 'character', 'Gen.', 'Savage', 'universal', 'timeless.Gen', 'Savage', 'friend', 'commanding', 'officer', '918th', 'Bomber', 'Group', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'different', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'movie', 'chess', 'game', 'Gen.', 'Savage', 'play', 'get', 'bomber', 'group', 'operate', 'effectively', 'casualties', 'first', 'glance', 'easy', 'answer', 'why', 'bomber', 'group', 'not', 'doing', 'well', 'movie', 'around', 'Gen.', 'Savage', 'picking', 'organization', 'apart', 'find', 'problems', 'Gen.', 'Savage', 'implements', 'changes', 'fix', 'issues', 'met', 'heavy', 'resistance', 'own', 'men', 'majority', 'movie', 'dedicated', 'how', 'Gen.', 'Savage', 'changes', 'bomber', 'group.This', 'movie', 'strategy', 'not', 'strategy', 'war', 'rather', 'strategy', 'problems', 'encountered', 'when', 'trying', 'implement', 'organizational', 'change', 'move', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'exciting', 'role', 'Gen.', 'Savage', 'could', 'easily', 'been', 'CEO', 'person', 'who', 'people.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'supervise', 'people', 'great', 'see', 'war', 'movie', 'scenes', 'issues', 'rather', 'death', 'violence', 'battlefield']",Twelve O'clock High VHS
225140,A1B6HZ2W5XCV0I,6300247090,Jersey Kid,"[7, 7]","A review of the Special Edition of Twelve O-clock High must be in two parts: the movie itself and the so-called extras that are supplied (thus giving the package its name and a higher cost [and sometime value]).The movie is a discourse on the impact of the stress of command on individuals. Set against the very early period of the US high-level, daylight bombing of Nazi occupied Europe, the 918th Bombardment Group - Heavy is the weak sister in the fledgling 8th Air Force. It is the unit that looses the most crews, has the poorest bombing record, and the lowest morale.The movie opens with a chaotic return from a mission that went wrong from the onset and stayed that way to the end. When alerted for a mission the very next day, the group commander, Keith Davenport, goes to higher headquarters to complain. This action sets in motion the belief on the part of General Frank Savage that the problem lies in Davenport's hands for failing to manage the group such that pride and competence are imbued.The 8th Air Force commander agrees with Savage's assessment and relieves Davenport. He then sends Savage - a former group commander who was promoted to headquarters - to the 918th to straighten it out. Savage does this via the notional ""kickin' butts and taking names,"" and the group evolves into a successful team. The cost for doing this - beyond the horrendous loss of life that would have occurred one way or the other in wartime - is the mental collapse of Savage.For those seeking a ""shoot `em up war movie, you've come to the wrong place. This excellent film is a study in management and inter-personal relationships that is a mirror of not just the military, but also of business. Throughout it, individuals are placed in positions requiring strength of character and commitment. Some fail and some succeed; others do both and find redemption.As movie, I rate it as a five star.The extras are decidedly at the other end of the spectrum. A series of interviews with historians are interspersed with footage from the film offer some insight into the characters and events depicted, while offering virtually nothing about the making of the film or the context of the events.The extras rate a single star at best.However, the movie is of such strength that the Special Edition version of Twelve O'clock High is a four star item.",4,"take the movie, leave the extras",1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,2337,"['review', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Twelve', 'O-clock', 'High', 'must', 'be', 'two', 'parts', 'movie', 'so-called', 'extras', 'are', 'supplied', 'thus', 'giving', 'package', 'name', 'higher', 'cost', '[', 'sometime', 'value', ']', '.The', 'movie', 'discourse', 'impact', 'stress', 'command', 'individuals', 'Set', 'very', 'early', 'period', 'US', 'high-level', 'daylight', 'bombing', 'Nazi', 'occupied', 'Europe', '918th', 'Bombardment', 'Group', 'Heavy', 'weak', 'sister', 'fledgling', '8th', 'Air', 'Force', 'unit', 'most', 'crews', 'poorest', 'bombing', 'record', 'lowest', 'morale.The', 'movie', 'chaotic', 'return', 'mission', 'went', 'wrong', 'onset', 'stayed', 'way', 'end', 'When', 'alerted', 'mission', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'group', 'commander', 'Keith', 'Davenport', 'higher', 'headquarters', 'complain', 'action', 'motion', 'belief', 'part', 'General', 'Frank', 'Savage', 'problem', 'Davenport', 'hands', 'failing', 'manage', 'group', 'such', 'pride', 'competence', 'are', 'imbued.The', '8th', 'Air', 'Force', 'commander', 'Savage', 'assessment', 'Davenport', 'then', 'Savage', 'former', 'group', 'commander', 'who', 'was', 'promoted', 'headquarters', '918th', 'straighten', 'out', 'Savage', 'notional', 'kickin', 'butts', 'taking', 'names', 'group', 'successful', 'team', 'cost', 'doing', 'horrendous', 'loss', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'occurred', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'wartime', 'mental', 'collapse', 'Savage.For', 'seeking', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'war', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'come', 'wrong', 'place', 'excellent', 'film', 'study', 'management', 'inter-personal', 'relationships', 'mirror', 'not', 'just', 'military', 'also', 'business', 'individuals', 'are', 'placed', 'positions', 'requiring', 'strength', 'character', 'commitment', 'fail', 'succeed', 'others', 'do', 'find', 'redemption.As', 'movie', 'rate', 'five', 'star.The', 'extras', 'are', 'decidedly', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'series', 'interviews', 'historians', 'are', 'interspersed', 'footage', 'film', 'offer', 'insight', 'characters', 'events', 'depicted', 'offering', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'making', 'film', 'context', 'events.The', 'extras', 'rate', 'single', 'star', 'best.However', 'movie', 'such', 'strength', 'Special', 'Edition', 'version', 'Twelve', ""O'clock"", 'High', 'four', 'star', 'item']",Twelve O'clock High VHS

The unspoken goal: fly 25 missions with all limbs in tact and you've done your duty. One mission arrested my attention in the middle of this remarkable movie.  General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) announces a strategic target: the ball bearing factory.  Bomb just one factory (Germany's sole ball bearing supplier) and you'll disrupt assembly lines throughout the country. Brilliant!That's a great lesson for companies and organizations. What's your strategic target?  Is there one big bold action or one fork-in-the-road target that will change the battle for you?  Often, it's not just one thing--but many factors, but maybe it's time to think outside the plane--get up higher and evaluate where you're dropping your bombs. It's not the number of bombs you drop, it's the targets that you hit.Note to leaders and managers: order popcorn and soft drinks and plan a ""Staff Meeting at the Movies"" afternoon event.  The film showcases a phenomenal study in leadership and team building--with two distinct leadership styles in play.

The incredible pressure on these bomber pilots flying oh so slowly over hazardous terrain and against enemy fighters that would close three, four, five, even six times as fast must have been truly frightening. I used to think they were giants in the air watching the old Air Power series as a kid. 20 years ago my Dad and I were in Henden in England at the Royal Air Museum. One was on display and you could walk on a scaffold around it. IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE MORE THAN 70 FEET LONG. Home to 1st was longer!In a manner of speaking, 12 O'Clock High is like the old Basil Rathbone, David Niven and Errol Flynn ""Dawn Patrol,"" in which Commanding Officer Basil Rathbone wreaks his haunting revenge on Errol Flynn - by making him the CO.General Frank Savage, already having flown his missions over Occupied Europe, the equivalent of 'making his bones' in mobster's parlance, is asked to step back down and lead the 8th Air Force's 918th Bombardment Group into the fray. Again. The Group seems to have lost its esprit, its purpose, in a way, its courage. And Savage is no easy skipper. He tells the pilots to tighten the formation up . . . ""no, tighter . . . I want his wings in your ribs!"" And it pays off.But there's really more to it than that. It's the last line Frederich March utters in ""The Bridges of To Ko Ri,"" 'where do we get such men?'But just one point. 12 O'Clock is a great movie about the most complex emotion human beings can undergo. It's so complicated that we've forgotten about the human factors in the last two wars America fought, Korea and Vietnam. We don't have to knock other movies to arrive at that conclusion. Some are good, the aforementioned ToKoRi for example. Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Alec Guiness and William Holden in River Kwai. And certainly Spielberg's Private Ryan. 12 O'Clock High is great.

Barbier ""The Cocoli Kid""","[1, 1]","This is a classic film of warfare in the skies over Europe depicts the ultimate, definitive example of military leadership. In my US Navy career it was used as a training tool to show the different types of leadership competencies. This classic World War II drama features Gregory Peck in an Academy Award nominated 'Best Actor' role as General Frank Savage, who&#8217;s assigned to take over the Eight Air Force Mission of &#8220;daylight precision bombing&#8221; at a unit early in the war that is suffering staggering losses of both planes and crews. This great film was nominated for &#8216;Best Picture&#8217; and earned Dean Jagger a Best Supporting Actor statuette in his only nomination of his acting career. The film begins with Jagger&#8217;s character purchasing a Robin Hood Toby mug, which was used to indicate to all base personnel that a mission is scheduled for the day. After buying the mug keepsake he goes by train to Archbury and then bicycles to the site of the runways and the base, now overgrown with weeds, where this great heroic story had taken place some seven years earlier. I gave---this film five stars because if you have ever seen a B-17 Flying Fortress at an air show you can appreciate the courage it took to fly and fight in what was then the state of the art. The film will clearly show the sacrifice of these young men who dare to do what others thought impossible and did it when called upon. The film also touches on &#8216;maximum effort&#8217; what it is and what does it mean. In conclusion the aerial footage is real combat film footage that makes you wonder at time how an aircrew could live and survive the flack over the target area.

225161,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6300247090,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[3, 3]","This is an extremely powerful, intelligent and BRILLIANT war film! Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.USAAF air base Archbury in United Kingdom, autumn 1942. The 918th Bomb Group of USAAF, operating the B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers, one of the first American units to attack targets in Nazi-occupied Europe from British bases, attracts attention of allied high command for its repeated bad performances and especially very high losses. It is now known as ""Bad Luck 918"" and morale in it is low, even if its commanding officer, Colonel Davenport, is known for his courage under fire and also for the attention given to his men welfare. He is therefore still popular with his men. But the high command decides to sack him and replace him with Brigadier-General Frank Savage - a somehow extraordinary appointment, considering that Bomb Groups were usually not commanded by generals.Savage (Gregory Peck) is a young and extremely vigorous general - he also quickly proves to be absolutely ruthless in restoring discipline and squeezing from his men everything they can give! He quickly becomes object of intense hatred and things will ultimately go very, very far between him and the men under his command... That takes care of about first eight minutes of the film, and I will say no more here.The great quality of this particularly brilliant film, which got two Oscars in 1949, is due in large part to the men who wrote the novel ""Twelve O'Clock High"" published in 1948 and immediately adapted to the screen.Ukrainian-Jewish immigrant Sy Bartlett (he was born Sacha Baraniev in Ukraine in 1901), was first a journalist before becoming a screenplay writer in the 30s. During war he served as Intelligene Officer in USAAF in Europe and could therefore observe well the functionning of real Bomb Groups. Colonel Beirne Lay Jr. served during WWII in USAAF and actualy commanded a Bomb Group, the 487th, leading it into numerous missions over Germany (albeit the 487th operated the B-24 Liberators, rather than the B-17 Flying Fortress). Their co-operation produced an excellent book - and when they were also asked to adapt ""Twelve O'Clock High"" into a scenario, they did again an excellent job.Actors did an amazing job in this film, beginning of course with Gregory Peck, for whom it was one of the most brilliant performances EVER! It is simply incredible how tough is his character and when a really bad@ss general is played by such a young, handsome and charismatic person the effect is particularly strong! Believe me, it is not for nothing that his character is named ""Savage""...)))The names of other actors are not instantly recognizable today anymore, as most of them were specialists of second roles - and it was fitting, because this film is first and above anything else a performance by Gregory Peck, who offers here a brilliant study about a lot of things but especially about the bittersweet taste of great power and about the unavoidable and necessary solitude of the man on the top...IMPORTANT DETAIL! This is a war film WITHOUT fighting scenes, as everything happens on the USAAF bases - but believe me, you will not even notice this little detail! Also, it is a long film - 132 minutes - but once again, you will not even notice the time passing!SECOND IMPORTANT DETAIL! The title ""Twelve O'Clock High"" is in principle the code word the crews of allied bombers used to signal enemy fighters attacking frontally and from above - this was considered the deadliest way to attack a heavily armed formation of heavy bombers and therefore those words, when heard on the interphone, were heavily packed with menace... However, this title means also A LOT OF OTHER THINGS - once you finished watching this film, take a minute to consider other possible meanings... This reflection is actually another reason why I consider this film as such a major masterpiece!CONCLUSION: an incredible war film, without one weak scene, mostly VERY tough and brutal, but also with some discreet humor here and there. A thing to buy, watch, keep and re-watch! ENJOY!",5,"""We're in a war, a shooting war. We've got to fight.

225178,A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP,6300247090,Phil Berardelli,"[3, 3]","The movie's time frame, setting and plot are all similar to Command Decision, another fine wartime drama about air combat. But this one features a different cast and much more action. Gregory Peck plays Brigadier Gen. Frank Savage, who is given a critical task. In 1942 in England, early in World War II, he must restore the effectiveness and morale of the men of the 918th bomber group while replacing their beloved commander, Gen. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill). The way he does so is tremendously difficult for both him and his men, but given what's at stake - possibly the outcome of the war - you can see that he has no choice. This movie was cited most often by members of the U.S. 8th Air Force as the most accurate representation of their lives and missions dramatized on film. Written by Beirne Lay, Jr. and Sy Bartlett from their novel, it is an intelligent, highly thoughtful portrayal of the stresses of command in wartime, and it's a tribute to the quiet but amazing heroism of the men who flew bombing missions against Germany. The 12-minute combat sequence featuring B-17 bombers against Messerschmitt and Focke-Wulf fighters is incredibly harrowing and more realistic than anything else on film - because it is real battle footage. Dean Jagger won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Peck's top aide, and Peck himself is terrific, as are Millard Mitchell as the Air Force commander in England, and Hugh Marlowe (in possibly his best role) as a trouble-plagued pilot.Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)",4,"A fine wartime drama, enhanced by real aerial combat footage",1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,1563,"['movie', 'time', 'frame', 'setting', 'plot', 'are', 'similar', 'Command', 'Decision', 'fine', 'wartime', 'drama', 'air', 'combat', 'one', 'different', 'cast', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Brigadier', 'Gen.', 'Frank', 'Savage', 'who', 'given', 'critical', 'task', '1942', 'England', 'early', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'must', 'restore', 'effectiveness', 'morale', 'men', '918th', 'bomber', 'group', 'replacing', 'beloved', 'commander', 'Gen.', 'Keith', 'Davenport', 'Gary', 'Merrill', 'way', 'so', 'tremendously', 'difficult', 'men', 'given', 'what', 'stake', 'possibly', 'outcome', 'war', 'can', 'see', 'choice', 'movie', 'was', 'cited', 'most', 'often', 'members', 'U.S.', '8th', 'Air', 'Force', 'most', 'accurate', 'representation', 'lives', 'missions', 'dramatized', 'film', 'Written', 'Beirne', 'Lay', 'Jr.', 'Sy', 'Bartlett', 'novel', 'intelligent', 'highly', 'thoughtful', 'portrayal', 'stresses', 'command', 'wartime', 'tribute', 'quiet', 'amazing', 'heroism', 'men', 'who', 'flew', 'bombing', 'missions', 'Germany', '12-minute', 'combat', 'sequence', 'featuring', 'B-17', 'bombers', 'Messerschmitt', 'Focke-Wulf', 'fighters', 'incredibly', 'harrowing', 'more', 'realistic', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'real', 'battle', 'footage', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Peck', 'top', 'aide', 'Peck', 'terrific', 'are', 'Millard', 'Mitchell', 'Air', 'Force', 'commander', 'England', 'Hugh', 'Marlowe', 'possibly', 'best', 'role', 'trouble-plagued', 'pilot.Phil', 'Favorite', '500', 'Loves', 'Moviegoing', 'Lifetime', '2014', 'edition']",Twelve O'clock High VHS

225184,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6300247090,Robert Morris,"[169, 175]","I do not recall another film whose opening and closing scenes are more effective than those in this brilliant portrayal of the 918th Bombardment group based in England which flew almost daily missions to Germany during World War II. The character of General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) is reputedly based on Brigadier General Frank A. Armstrong, Jr. Sy Bartlett co-authored the screenplay with the book's author, Berney Lay, Jr. Brilliantly directed by Henry King, we are introduced to a combination of combat fatigue and self-pity which results in the replacement of Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) by his friend Savage who is told by his commanding officer, General Pritchard (Millard Mitchell), to shape up the 918th while avoiding Davenport's problem: Becoming overly involved emotionally in decisions to send B-17 crews on exceptionally dangerous missions, day after day after day. Savage immediately establishes his authority and almost immediately loses whatever goodwill he may have had. He applies and then maintains constant pressure on the crews to improve their performance in all areas of flight operations. Underachievers are reassigned to one B-17 renamed ""The Leper Colony."" Morale deteriorates to such a point that those at headquarters become concerned. A formal investigation of the situation is conducted. This is a critical moment for Savage.  If he has ""lost"" his men, he cannot continue. In fact, he expects to be relieved and begins to pack his personal items. However, for reasons best revealed in the film, Savage remains in command. And then....It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen this film to say any more about the plot. Suffice to say that brilliant direction, great acting by everyone involved (notably by Dean Jagger who received an Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role), superb cinematography (Leon Shamroy), and haunting music (Alfred Newman) are seamlessly integrated in this analysis of effective leadership (especially decision-making) under wartime conditions. The film begins when Harvey Stovall (Jagger) makes an especially significant purchase in an antique store and then proceeds to what has by then become an abandoned air base. As we begin to hear the bombers' propellers whine as the engines roar to life, we are transported back in time. Later, as the film ends, civilian Stovall climbs back on his rented bike and departs what is again an abandoned air base.

225185,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,6300247090,Roger J. Buffington,"[12, 13]","Twelve ""O'Clock High is a powerful and true-to-life film dealing with the early days of the 8th US Air Force in Great Britain.  Its mission: to bomb Germany not by night in saturation bombings as the British were doing, but instead to boldly engage in ""precision daylight bombing.""  No one knew if the concept was viable because no one had ever dared try it before on a large scale.  Gregory Peck plays the role of a leader suddenly thrust into command of a deeply troubled, demoralized, and shot-up bomber squadron.  How he motivates the men and overcomes the fact that the men well know that their chances of survival were poor (the worst survival odds of any American combat assignment in the war) is a deeply moving, powerful, indeed unforgettable story.  This is a great movie.The cinematography of this movie is wonderful, featuring actual combat footage of B-17s engaging German Focke-Wulf fighters in deadly combat.  The sense of authenticity that this movie brings to the screen is total.  One feels transposed back into England in 1942, engaged in a life-and-death struggle in the air against the Germans.  The uniforms, dialogue, everything, about this movie reeks of authenticity.  The storyline moves along at a breakneck pace--no dull interludes.  And yet this is not just a ""shoot-em-up"" war flick.  It is a stirring story of leadership, personality clashes, honest fear and human imperfections that reminds us what an incredible debt we all owe to the men who fought and won the air war over Nazi Germany.This is a DVD movie to keep and watch repeatedly over the years.

225189,AY3AVLL5IWW9,6300247090,Russell Fanelli,"[18, 19]","12 O'Clock High is one of the best films on leadership ever made. The story opens with the return to England of American bomber pilots from a daylight bombing mission over Nazi occupied Europe.  Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) is the commander of a squadron whose task it is to destroy German military installations.  He is a competent professional officer who cares deeply for his men.  Unfortunately, in his zeal to keep them from being killed, he forgets his mission and is relieved of his command.Col. Davenport is replaced by General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck), who says to the pilots at his first meeting with them, &quot;Consider yourself already dead.&quot;  This speech signals a completely different approach to leadership.  General Savage relentlessly trains the pilots and succeeds in building a first-rate fighting unit.  His hard line does not come without a price.  His men rebel and want to be transferred out of the unit.  Only with the help of his adjutant (Dean Jagger) does Savage hold the group together and begin to build competence and esprit de corp.The effects of contrasting leadership styles have seldom been so effectively portrayed.  Colonel Davenport is a first-rate officer who over identifies with his men and fails miserably.  The moral of the story is that the appropriate leadership style is essential to accomplish challenging goals and objectives.  It is not enough to be hard working, conscientious, and caring.  Leaders must analyze the situation, know the competence and commitment of their people, and then select the style of leadership appropriate for the task at hand.The dramatic scenes between Davenport, Savage, and the American pilots are expertly written and filled with tension.  Actual war footage is used for several of the action scenes and the film moves forward at a steady pace.  The performances of the entire cast are excellent with Gregory Peck, always a reliable actor, at the top of his form. Dean Jagger took home the Academy Award for best supporting actor in a film that deserved similar honors.",5,"12 O'Clock High, a great film about leadership",1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,2067,"['12', ""O'Clock"", 'High', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'leadership', 'ever', 'made', 'story', 'return', 'England', 'American', 'bomber', 'pilots', 'daylight', 'bombing', 'mission', 'Nazi', 'occupied', 'Europe', 'Colonel', 'Keith', 'Davenport', 'Gary', 'Merrill', 'commander', 'squadron', 'task', 'destroy', 'German', 'military', 'installations', 'competent', 'professional', 'officer', 'who', 'deeply', 'men', 'Unfortunately', 'zeal', 'keep', 'being', 'killed', 'mission', 'relieved', 'command.Col', 'Davenport', 'replaced', 'General', 'Frank', 'Savage', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'who', 'pilots', 'first', 'meeting', 'quot', 'Consider', 'already', 'dead.', 'quot', 'speech', 'completely', 'different', 'approach', 'leadership', 'General', 'Savage', 'relentlessly', 'pilots', 'building', 'first-rate', 'fighting', 'unit', 'hard', 'line', 'not', 'come', 'price', 'men', 'rebel', 'want', 'be', 'transferred', 'unit', 'Only', 'help', 'adjutant', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'Savage', 'hold', 'group', 'together', 'begin', 'build', 'competence', 'esprit', 'corp.The', 'effects', 'contrasting', 'leadership', 'styles', 'have', 'seldom', 'been', 'so', 'effectively', 'portrayed', 'Colonel', 'Davenport', 'first-rate', 'officer', 'who', 'identifies', 'men', 'miserably', 'moral', 'story', 'appropriate', 'leadership', 'style', 'essential', 'accomplish', 'challenging', 'goals', 'objectives', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'hard', 'working', 'conscientious', 'caring', 'Leaders', 'must', 'analyze', 'situation', 'know', 'competence', 'commitment', 'people', 'then', 'select', 'style', 'leadership', 'appropriate', 'task', 'hand.The', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'Davenport', 'Savage', 'American', 'pilots', 'are', 'expertly', 'written', 'filled', 'tension', 'Actual', 'war', 'footage', 'used', 'several', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'forward', 'steady', 'pace', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'always', 'reliable', 'actor', 'top', 'form', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'took', 'home', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'film', 'deserved', 'similar', 'honors']",Twelve O'clock High VHS

Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) when the hard-luck group threatens to fall apart.  Or is it really a hard-luck group?  TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH is a movie about leadership, first and foremost, and also the limits of endurance.  At issue is the viability of daylight precision bombing, a fighting tactic that demands tight formations and low altitude attacks.  It's `our one hope of shortening this war,"" Maj. Gen. Ben Pritchard (Millard Mitchell) tells Savage at one point, and the 918th are spearheading the test.  And they're falling apart.  Col. Davenport is relieved of command and replaced by Savage.  His failing was an over-identification with his men, propping them up when he should have been testing them to seen when a man reaches his breaking point, when they've taken all they could.  Enter Gen. Frank Savage. If Davenport is a bit rumpled, Savage is all spit-and-polish, a by-the-book general stopping just short of being a martinet.TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH is a convincing look at the problems of command without any distracting side stories mucking up things.  Dean Jagger, as Maj. Harvey Stovall, won a deserved Academy Award as the general's soft-spoken clerk, a lawyer in real life, who acts as the chronicler of the evolution of the 918th from a dissension ridden outfit to a formidable fighting unit.  The movie, in fact, is presented as Stovall's post-war flashback.TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH uses authentic combat film of US and German planes in action.  The film is well incorporated in the movie, it feels real, but battle is secondary to the human drama at the heart of the movie.  For my money this is Gregory Peck's best movie, drawing on all his strengths as an actor, allowing his air of reserved authority to impart an almost tragic note to his character.

You can read many other customer reviews which really cover the movie. Since the DVD was released today (see date of review), I'll just write a few words about it.The movie's presentation is excellent. Contrast is good and the image is clean and crisp. Menus are anamorphic even though the movie itself is presented properly in its original full-frame aspect (1.33:1) ratio. (The opening titles are generously windowboxed to show the whole frame.) Sound is very good, with options for stereo or mono English, or mono French. Subtitles are thankfully provided, in English or Spanish. Sounds terrific so far, doesn't it? It is! But...Where the disc falters is in its extras. Put simply, there really aren't any, at least not related to the movie. The ONLY extras are a selection of original trailers from other war films: THE LONGEST DAY, PATTON, THE THIN RED LINE, TORA! TORA! TORA! and THE SAND PEBBLES. There isn't even a trailer for TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH, the very movie presented on the disc! I suppose Fox didn't have anything and included those other trailers (a) to make up for it, and (b) as free promotion for their other DVDs. Well, okay, I guess I don't have a problem with that... but why is the list price ... the SAME as that of TORA! TORA! TORA! which includes a new 20-minute documentary and commentary, and THE SAND PEBBLES which also includes a commentary and some audio features?

225197,A3XMO0OGZ5N9Z,6300247090,Stuart Humpert,"[5, 111]","Twelve O'clock High is about an air force commander (Gary Merril) who has reached his breaking point. Brigadier General Savage (Gregory Peck) takes his place, and is at first very tough with the pilots who are now under his command. They resent Savage at first, but slowly change as he leads them to success. But soon Savage reaches his own breaking point.I really disliked Twelve O'clock High. It was a really a boring movie. Roughly 5 minutes of the 2 hour and 12 minute movie involved aerial scenes. In one sequence, we see the crew boarding their planes. Then we see a 3 second clip of airplanes flying above the clouds. Then we cut back to the airfield where the crews are getting out of their planes. It was just way too short. The key to the movie was the aerial bombing aspect of it. That was what drove the first air force commander (Gary Merril) to the breaking point. But all we see is him talking about what happened during the bombing run. The same goes for Savage, who is also driven to his breaking point. All we get to see of him in combat is some short but spectacular aerial battle footage.The characters themselves are weak. You don't really have any feelings for the characters. The sad message that comes across is true; these pilots should consider themselves dead, because they don't know if they'll ever make it out alive. But the movie lacks any sense of emotion. It just drags on and on with dialogue scenes that are extremely boring. It was also very loosely held together. You can't even tell when the pilots are beginning to like Savage instead of resenting him.I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The spectacular aerial battle footage wasn't enough to salvage this boring film. I would suggest The Guns Of Navarone or The Bridge On The River Kwai instead.",1,1/2 STAR: Twelve O&#65533;clock High is a boring movie...,1040688000,"12 24, 2002",2002,1793,"['Twelve', ""O'clock"", 'High', 'air', 'force', 'commander', 'Gary', 'Merril', 'who', 'reached', 'breaking', 'point', 'Brigadier', 'General', 'Savage', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'place', 'first', 'very', 'tough', 'pilots', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'command', 'resent', 'Savage', 'first', 'slowly', 'change', 'success', 'soon', 'Savage', 'own', 'breaking', 'point.I', 'really', 'disliked', 'Twelve', ""O'clock"", 'High', 'was', 'really', 'boring', 'movie', 'Roughly', '5', 'minutes', '2', 'hour', '12', 'minute', 'movie', 'involved', 'aerial', 'scenes', 'one', 'sequence', 'see', 'crew', 'boarding', 'planes', 'Then', 'see', '3', 'second', 'clip', 'airplanes', 'flying', 'clouds', 'Then', 'cut', 'back', 'airfield', 'where', 'crews', 'are', 'getting', 'planes', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'key', 'movie', 'was', 'aerial', 'bombing', 'aspect', 'was', 'what', 'drove', 'first', 'air', 'force', 'commander', 'Gary', 'Merril', 'breaking', 'point', 'see', 'talking', 'what', 'happened', 'bombing', 'run', 'same', 'Savage', 'who', 'also', 'driven', 'breaking', 'point', 'get', 'see', 'combat', 'short', 'spectacular', 'aerial', 'battle', 'footage.The', 'characters', 'are', 'weak', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'feelings', 'characters', 'sad', 'message', 'across', 'true', 'pilots', 'should', 'consider', 'dead', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'movie', 'sense', 'emotion', 'just', 'drags', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'boring', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'loosely', 'held', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'when', 'pilots', 'are', 'beginning', 'like', 'Savage', 'instead', 'resenting', 'him.I', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'spectacular', 'aerial', 'battle', 'footage', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'salvage', 'boring', 'film', 'would', 'suggest', 'Guns', 'Navarone', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'instead']",Twelve O'clock High VHS

225200,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,6300247090,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[7, 7]",This is a film which was made four years after the end of the Second World War and it uses a lot of actual documentary footage. The plot is about a squadron of US heavy bombers. The film is set at a time in the war when the German air defences were at their most efficient and they were taking a heavy toll of the unescorted US bombers.The plot of the film is about a tough commanding officer who is appointed to try to keep things together despite the ferocious punishment being suffered by the US air crews. He stigmatises those who have lost their nerve by having them fly in a plane marked for cowards. For the other air crews he emphasises discipline as a means of ensuring the bombers keep tight formation to maximise the defensive potential of their guns and produce accurate bombing.Initially his toughness and uncompromising attitude leads to hostility from the men he commands. As the film progresses however it becomes clear that he has always had a deep respect for the men who have flown under him. The last scene is one of the more effective as it shows him breaking down as he realises the number of casualties in a particular action.War films often do not age very well at all. Those made close to the conflict they portray are often jingoistic or are unreal. This film is unusual as it has dated well and is still easy to watch even today. The action scenes using old footage are simply amazing.

225204,A3CFT5LHFCB46K,6300247090,"""weirdo_87""","[11, 13]","When most people think of a war movie, they think of hordes of soldiers charging an enemy position as machine guns mow them down while shells create spectacular explosions in the background. Twelve O'Clock High is different; Except for a combat mission near the film's end, there is hardly any combat action. Yet it is often regarded as one of the best war movies. (Some plot spoilers).Gregory Peck is outstanding in one of his greatest performances. Portraying Air Force General Savage, Peck takes command of the 918th Bomb Group during the early years of World War II, when daylight bombing over Europe was still in question. The previous commander, Col. Keith Davenport was relieved of command for getting too involved with his men and reaching a breaking point. After their most recent mission was a failure, moral is low in the unit. When Savage takes over, he also discovers that discipline isn't strict enough in the unit. Guards, for example, don't check on people entering the base and on-duty officers leave their posts to get drunk.Savage, at first, enforces discipline on the 918th members, particularly the lazy air executive officer, to the point where the pilots put in requests for transfer. The transfers are delayed, allowing Savage time to change his men's minds. As the 918th successfully completes one mission after another, Gen. Savage soon comes to know and respect his men and feel for him like his own children. The pilots withdraw their transfers and Savage begins to push himself further on the missions to find out what a `Maximum Effort' is. However, the stress of command and the loss of some pilots soon starts effecting Savage and he breaks down as well.This movie is excellent in how it studies about the psychological effect of war on men. As seen in this film, the bomber crews could take a lot of flying, but only so much. There is one scene I particularly like in the movie. After a mission in the film's beginning, one of the flyers tells an interrogation officer about the bloody flight, where one man was decapitated. The description is detailed, yet none of the actual damage is shown. It goes to show that words can be just as powerful as images.",5,"""We've got to fight.
