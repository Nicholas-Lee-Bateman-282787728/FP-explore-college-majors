The young man who hosts the DVD is very knowledgeable about Creation Science and the location that he is exploring. He gives information from a Creation point of view while helping children to understand the evolutionist point of view and then debunking it by Biblically backing up the Creation point of view. There are lots of wonderful scenic views of the area, maps, facts, and a combination of History and Science provided. I have noticed that not all sites provide the Study Guide we received with these DVDs and those that do require that you  order them separately for an additional cost. In my opinion this it's well worth it to by the Study Guide to accompany the DVD. The Study Guides are put out by Master Books. The Study Guide breaks down to the various points of interest of the location and scientific, including vocabulary, discussion questions and bonus activities to do. We will be purchasing the rest of the series and will be looking forward to more being added in the future. It'll well be worth the investment to add them to our homeschool library. Note: you don't have to be a homeschooler to enjoy these videos, all can benefit greatly from them.

1526161,A269SWH1PQL4PQ,B0074AWO08,Dustybug,"[0, 0]","we've found a great resource to aid in the science department of our homeschool with the Awesome Science series featuring the young host, Noah Justice.  Produced by Kyle Justice who has worked for the likes of National Geographic, ESPN, and The Outdoors Channel, this series, Noah tours many of the world's most famous geological sites and shows how their origins line up perfectly well with a young earth creationist worldview.Each thirty minute video contains information weaving biblical account with scientific observations to show that so many of the things that secular scientists would have you believe couldn't possibly happen within a 6,000 year earth age time frame, actually fit in quite well with Scripture.They are not at all dry and are packed with tons of educational information in a light and informative way!  Noah, the young host, is personable and articulate but has a personality that children will find easy to watch.  He lays out information comparing secular scientists views against biblical account and shows how even the fossil layers were created rapidly during the global flood of Noah's time rather than over millions and millions of years as evolutionists believe.In the first episode, Explore the Grand Canyon, you can learn:-how the Grand Canyon was not eroded by the Colorado River over millions of years, but was the product of the waters that covered the earth during the flood-how the sedimentary layers of the Canyon show that they were laid down in far less time than modern day scientists tell us- how the moving continents contributed to the formation of inland lakes, valleys, canyons, mountains, etc. so that the post-flood world looked entirely different than it had before-how many secular claims can be disproved using science and the Bible.The scenery in the video is breathtaking and there are scripture references posted across the screen when applicable so that you can take notes and go search your Bible after viewing. Study guides are available if you would like to expand the use of them from supplements to actual curriculum or to just further discussion with your family about how we can confirm the biblical historical record by closely examining the world around us.",5,Education with a Biblical Perspective!,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,2224,"[""'ve"", 'found', 'great', 'resource', 'aid', 'science', 'department', 'homeschool', 'Awesome', 'Science', 'series', 'featuring', 'young', 'host', 'Noah', 'Justice', 'Produced', 'Kyle', 'Justice', 'who', 'worked', 'likes', 'National', 'Geographic', 'ESPN', 'Outdoors', 'Channel', 'series', 'Noah', 'tours', 'many', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'geological', 'sites', 'how', 'origins', 'line', 'up', 'perfectly', 'well', 'young', 'earth', 'creationist', 'worldview.Each', 'thirty', 'minute', 'video', 'information', 'weaving', 'biblical', 'account', 'scientific', 'observations', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'secular', 'scientists', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'happen', '6,000', 'year', 'earth', 'age', 'time', 'frame', 'actually', 'fit', 'quite', 'well', 'Scripture.They', 'are', 'not', 'dry', 'are', 'packed', 'tons', 'educational', 'information', 'light', 'informative', 'way', 'Noah', 'young', 'host', 'personable', 'articulate', 'personality', 'children', 'will', 'find', 'easy', 'watch', 'out', 'information', 'comparing', 'secular', 'scientists', 'views', 'biblical', 'account', 'how', 'even', 'fossil', 'layers', 'were', 'created', 'rapidly', 'global', 'flood', 'Noah', 'time', 'rather', 'millions', 'millions', 'years', 'evolutionists', 'believe.In', 'first', 'episode', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'can', 'learn', '-how', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'was', 'not', 'eroded', 'Colorado', 'River', 'millions', 'years', 'was', 'product', 'waters', 'covered', 'earth', 'flood-how', 'sedimentary', 'layers', 'Canyon', 'show', 'were', 'laid', 'down', 'far', 'less', 'time', 'modern', 'day', 'scientists', 'tell', 'us-', 'how', 'moving', 'continents', 'contributed', 'formation', 'inland', 'lakes', 'valleys', 'canyons', 'mountains', 'etc', 'post-flood', 'world', 'looked', 'entirely', 'different', 'had', 'before-how', 'many', 'secular', 'claims', 'can', 'be', 'disproved', 'using', 'science', 'Bible.The', 'scenery', 'video', 'breathtaking', 'are', 'scripture', 'references', 'posted', 'screen', 'when', 'applicable', 'so', 'can', 'take', 'notes', 'go', 'search', 'Bible', 'viewing', 'Study', 'guides', 'are', 'available', 'would', 'like', 'expand', 'use', 'supplements', 'actual', 'curriculum', 'just', 'further', 'discussion', 'family', 'how', 'can', 'confirm', 'biblical', 'historical', 'record', 'closely', 'examining', 'world']",Explore the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice

1526163,A6D07P6DHMXIP,B0074AWO08,"L. Courtney ""Book Mom""","[1, 1]","When Jason and I attended the homeschool convention in March, we saw these Awesome Science DVDs for sale.  I thought that they looked interesting, but we were purposefully trying not to spend much unplanned money, so we passed them up.  I was excited to later have the opportunity to review this episode of Awesome Science with the kids.The Facts:Awesome Science is a Biblical creation based series of science DVDs that use real, on location footage, along with pictures to bring science concepts to life.  The spokesperson is Noah Justice (and occasionally his younger brother).  This installment is Explore the Grand Canyon.  In this installment, Noah uses the earth science from the Grand Canyon and the historical account of the flood from the Bible to show how the canyon's features formed during the world wide flood.  Kids are introduced to various aspects of earth science and are reminded again and again that science and the Bible are truly compatible.The Good:*  We liked that the movie was narrated by a kid.  I think that made it appealing even to my younger set.*  Everything here is very Biblically based.  True science is compatible with the Bible- even though many secular scientists (and unfortunately some Christians) would argue.  These videos constantly look to interpret scientific findings in light of a Biblical worldview.*  We use Apologia science, and the information in the video fit perfectly with some things we've studied in General Science this year.  I imagine that this would be the case with any Creation-based science curriculum you might choose.*  The movie was complex enough to offer information to my middle schoolers but appealing to younger kids because of a kid narrator.  It made for a nice multi-aged choice.The Bad:*  After the first few minutes that were somewhat exciting, my kids lost interest.  This may have had to do with the fact that they were just ready to be done for the day and not inclined to be very interested in much. But, the entire movie was just Noah talking- with various photos or video showing in the background.  It was hard to hold their interest.*  Because of all the talking, I felt that there was a lot of information just thrown at the kids with no chance of processing in between.The Conclusion:Even though my crew was less than excited about this DVD, I could see these being a useful resource along with a Creation-based science curriculum.  I think it would be better to use the video to present new information and then study the information in more detail through your curriculum.  We were doing the opposite, looking at the earth science of the Grand Canyon.  That was a topic we had studied in detail this past school year.  I would still like to see the other videos in the series.  I love that this is a family project created by other homeschoolers, and I would love to support that!",3,"Good Idea, Maybe Not So Interesting?",1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,2867,"['When', 'Jason', 'attended', 'homeschool', 'convention', 'March', 'saw', 'Awesome', 'Science', 'DVDs', 'sale', 'thought', 'looked', 'interesting', 'were', 'purposefully', 'trying', 'not', 'spend', 'much', 'unplanned', 'money', 'passed', 'up', 'was', 'excited', 'later', 'have', 'opportunity', 'review', 'episode', 'Awesome', 'Science', 'kids.The', 'Facts', 'Awesome', 'Science', 'Biblical', 'creation', 'based', 'series', 'science', 'DVDs', 'use', 'real', 'location', 'footage', 'pictures', 'bring', 'science', 'concepts', 'life', 'spokesperson', 'Noah', 'Justice', 'occasionally', 'younger', 'brother', 'installment', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'installment', 'Noah', 'earth', 'science', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'historical', 'account', 'flood', 'Bible', 'show', 'how', 'canyon', 'features', 'formed', 'world', 'wide', 'flood', 'Kids', 'are', 'introduced', 'various', 'aspects', 'earth', 'science', 'are', 'reminded', 'again', 'again', 'science', 'Bible', 'are', 'truly', 'compatible.The', 'Good', '*', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'narrated', 'kid', 'think', 'made', 'appealing', 'even', 'younger', 'set', '*', 'Everything', 'here', 'very', 'Biblically', 'based', 'True', 'science', 'compatible', 'Bible-', 'even', 'many', 'secular', 'scientists', 'unfortunately', 'Christians', 'would', 'argue', 'videos', 'constantly', 'look', 'interpret', 'scientific', 'findings', 'light', 'Biblical', 'worldview', 'use', 'Apologia', 'science', 'information', 'video', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'things', ""'ve"", 'studied', 'General', 'Science', 'year', 'imagine', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'Creation-based', 'science', 'curriculum', 'might', 'choose', '*', 'movie', 'was', 'complex', 'enough', 'offer', 'information', 'middle', 'schoolers', 'appealing', 'younger', 'kids', 'kid', 'narrator', 'made', 'nice', 'multi-aged', 'choice.The', 'Bad', '*', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'were', 'somewhat', 'exciting', 'kids', 'lost', 'interest', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'do', 'fact', 'were', 'just', 'ready', 'be', 'done', 'day', 'not', 'inclined', 'be', 'very', 'interested', 'much', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'Noah', 'talking-', 'various', 'photos', 'video', 'showing', 'background', 'was', 'hard', 'hold', 'interest', 'talking', 'felt', 'was', 'lot', 'information', 'just', 'thrown', 'kids', 'chance', 'processing', 'between.The', 'Conclusion', 'Even', 'crew', 'was', 'less', 'excited', 'DVD', 'could', 'see', 'being', 'useful', 'resource', 'Creation-based', 'science', 'curriculum', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'use', 'video', 'present', 'new', 'information', 'then', 'study', 'information', 'more', 'detail', 'curriculum', 'were', 'doing', 'opposite', 'looking', 'earth', 'science', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'was', 'topic', 'had', 'studied', 'detail', 'past', 'school', 'year', 'would', 'still', 'like', 'see', 'other', 'videos', 'series', 'love', 'family', 'project', 'created', 'other', 'homeschoolers', 'would', 'love', 'support']",Explore the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice
1526164,A20DCQ0TRSB7U3,B0074AWO08,Lisa,"[0, 0]","Many people automatically disregard the Grand Canyon's formation as a result of a catastrophic worldwide flood in favor of the slow process of river erosion over millions of years.  This is because they prescribe to the philosophy of ""the present holding the key to the past.""But, using examples of Empirical Science seen at Mt. St. Helens and Glen Canyon Dam in recent years, even non-believers can see the evidence supporting a worldwide flood.Join 14 year old, homeschooled, Noah Justice in Explore the  Grand Canyon which takes you through the evidence  supporting and defending a Biblical worldview of a worldwide, catastrophic flood.  Some of these evidences include:  Angle (slope) of sand dunes, bent rock layers without fractures, absence of burrowing animals between rock layers and the irony of a large flood carving the canyons on Mars.Back when I studied the Grand Canyon in college, I didn't get the whole idea of an ocean flooding this area and then receding multiple times over millions of years in order to leave behind the fossil layering we presently see.  However, a catastrophic flood clearly explains this.  This very well done, illustrated 30 minute video does a great job explaining this concept and others including the presence of the SAME rock layers in North America, Europe and Asia!I recommend the study guide that is also available.  It's a great tool that has general knowledge about the Grand Canyon, bonus activities, sections specifically on the Colorado River, Canyon Walls, Dunes, The Great Flood and the receding waters plus much more.I really like the discussion questions throughout the guide.  For  example, ""Why do secular scientists choose to believe so quickly that the canyons on Mars were possibly formed by mega-floods without the huge amount of water to be found, yet they don't think the same sort of event caused the formation of the Grand Canyon?""The Awesome Science Series is one that should be in every home library.

He's going to take you on field trips to some incredible places like the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. These field trips will be presented from a Biblical (creation) worldview. Noah will be comparing the traditional evolution viewpoint found at most of these locations to the Biblical account of what happened.Having been to the Grand Canyon a couple of times since moving to Az, we were interested in watching Exploring the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice. Noah is quite entertaining in his presentation of the two different views of the Grand Canyon. The video itself is a good quality production which isn't surprising once we learned that the producer (Noah's Dad, Kyle Justice) has had his work featured on networks such as National Geographic and the Outdoor Channel. Being that the Justices are a homeschool family, it's no shock that the whole family is involved in these productions. It's fun to see a quality nature/science video presented by a kid to kids. Even though it's done in a kid-friendly format, people of all ages will enjoy the video.In this 30-minute video, Noah talks about how:*the evidence points toward the Grand Canyon being formed in days, not millions of years*the Grand Canyons layers show evidence of being laid down in less than a year, not millions of years*the Biblical record can be trusted as a historical account of the earth.Each video has an available study guide which includes review exercises for the various segments within the video. The study guides help viewers get the most out of the videos. Bonus activities are provided to allow the viewer to dig deeper into the topics being covered.When watching the video, you'll want to make sure you check out the bloopers as they are rather amusing.

If you are interpreting your evidence based on a preconceived notion that the earth is millions of years old, you ignore what that evidence would mean if the world is not that old.
