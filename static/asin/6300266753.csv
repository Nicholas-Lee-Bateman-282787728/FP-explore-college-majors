So much hypocrisy about its silly institution and &#34;oh sacred&#34; rules. So...the church itself is more important than the value of people's lives. That's great. No wonder why child sex abuse lasted for so long. Take a look at the Joe Paterno mess: Penn State is more important than the raped children. For all its worth, Donald Sutherland turns in another masterful performance, and it's the only reason why I see The Rosary Murders. All in all, The Rosary Murders is a nice little thriller, but I am still peeved by the idea of a confessional being inviolable. I am dropping its rating from `8' to `7'.",4,Drink the Blood of the Rosary for Christ Has...Whatever.,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,706,"['Viewed', '10/03', '7/12Rate', '77/12', 'More', 'reasons', 'hate', 'church', 'support', 'atheism', 'movement', 'So', 'much', 'hypocrisy', 'silly', 'institution', '34', 'oh', 'sacred', '34', 'rules', 'So', 'church', 'more', 'important', 'value', 'people', 'lives', 'great', 'wonder', 'why', 'child', 'sex', 'abuse', 'lasted', 'so', 'long', 'Take', 'look', 'Joe', 'Paterno', 'mess', 'Penn', 'State', 'more', 'important', 'raped', 'children', 'worth', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'masterful', 'performance', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'see', 'Rosary', 'Murders', 'Rosary', 'Murders', 'nice', 'little', 'thriller', 'am', 'still', 'peeved', 'idea', 'confessional', 'being', 'inviolable', 'am', 'dropping', 'rating', '8', '7']",N/A

There are some genuine scary moments, and I did have some sympathy for Sutherland's character.But it was obviously low budget and Sutherland plays it a bit aloof, almost bored.

231206,A152C8GYY25HAH,6300266753,Matthew Horner,"[10, 10]","""The Rosary Murders"" is a fairly satisfying thriller. By today's standards, it is almost sedate. It rolls out its tale of a killer targeting priest and nuns in a leisurely fashion. Considering the high number of victims, the gore factor is kept to a minimum. The `Creepiness Factor', however, is high - lots of dark hallways and uninviting settings.Donald Sutherland plays a Detroit priest who has the bad luck of hearing the killer's confession. The subplot about the priest's wrestling over the issue of the sanctity of confession  is actually more interesting than the main story about the killer and his motive. I am not a Catholic, but I have always been fascinated by the idea that a priest might sometimes be forced to carry around some really dreadful secrets.Sutherland does a fine job, although his performance seems to be a bit of a rehash of the characters he played in ""Klute"" [one of my very favorite thrillers] and the 1978 remake of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" [a fine sci-fi film]. The great Charles Durning doesn't have much to do in his role as a fellow priest. This is Sutherland's movie all the way.The script was co-written by the great crime / mystery novelist, Elmore Leonard. Anyone expecting the snappy, cynical dialog and eccentric characters found in his books will be disappointed. I looked up Leonard's script credits and, surprisingly, found that he has never written a cinematic equivalent to his works of fiction.",3,Odd but decent little thriller,1018742400,"04 14, 2002",2002,1451,"['Rosary', 'Murders', 'fairly', 'satisfying', 'thriller', 'today', 'standards', 'almost', 'sedate', 'out', 'tale', 'killer', 'targeting', 'priest', 'nuns', 'leisurely', 'fashion', 'Considering', 'high', 'number', 'victims', 'gore', 'factor', 'kept', 'minimum', 'Creepiness', 'Factor', 'however', 'high', 'lots', 'dark', 'hallways', 'uninviting', 'settings.Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Detroit', 'priest', 'who', 'bad', 'luck', 'hearing', 'killer', 'confession', 'subplot', 'priest', 'wrestling', 'issue', 'sanctity', 'confession', 'actually', 'more', 'interesting', 'main', 'story', 'killer', 'motive', 'am', 'not', 'Catholic', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'idea', 'priest', 'might', 'sometimes', 'be', 'forced', 'carry', 'around', 'really', 'dreadful', 'secrets.Sutherland', 'fine', 'job', 'performance', 'be', 'bit', 'rehash', 'characters', 'played', 'Klute', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'thrillers', ']', '1978', 'remake', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'fine', 'sci-fi', 'film', ']', 'great', 'Charles', 'Durning', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'role', 'fellow', 'priest', 'Sutherland', 'movie', 'way.The', 'script', 'was', 'co-written', 'great', 'crime', '/', 'mystery', 'novelist', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'Anyone', 'expecting', 'snappy', 'cynical', 'dialog', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'found', 'books', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'looked', 'up', 'Leonard', 'script', 'credits', 'surprisingly', 'found', 'never', 'written', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'works', 'fiction']",N/A
231207,A2X25C107CSLOR,6300266753,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[3, 7]","This ineffectual thriller by director Fred Walton features Donald Sutherland sleepwalking his way through the role of a priest who hears the confess of a serial killer but is unable to break the seal of silence the Catholic church imposes on the confessional. The use of the Hitchcock I Confess plot is different since here the confessor does not identify himself, so Sutherland must do some detective work before he finds himself in any compromising situations, since an anonymous confession isn't very useful. This thankfully gets Sutherland doing something and away from the turgid non-affair he is contemplating with Belinda Bauer. Although Charles Durning as Sutherland's pastor has practically nothing to work with, apart from one line about why Good Friday is thought to be good when that was the day Christ died, his scene of righteous outrage over the request for baptism of an unwed mother which reveals him as a hardliner is preferable to Sutherland's stupour. Sutherland may be seen as a more permissive priest when he challenges Durning with &quot;Why can't we be more concerned with peace of mind than piece of ass&quot; - but his performance is probably best defined when in one scene he rests his head on a staircase handrail as he speaks, in self-reflective exhaustion. It's amusing to contemplate Bauer's choice of romantic partner - someone who is the strong silent type and emotionally unavailable. Walton continues the serial killer plot far too leisurley, and while I can accept the numerous rosaries the killer has (his mark is to leave one wih each victim, in spite of the fact that they already have one being all clergy people!) it seems that every murder setpiece has a logical floor. eg  the first one is found by Sutherland when the door to her room has been left open for others to see. The idea that someone would leave the suicide scene of a relative untouched for 3 years, complete with broken rope and knocked-over stool, is perhaps taking the room-as-shrine concept a little too far (even allowing for the activities of the worshipper), and I also could have done without Sutherland drinking a Virgin Mary at a bar  and the obligatory blowing out of the candle as a victim passes by it. However Durning scores a laugh when he blasphemes, and some suspense is built up in a red-herring sequence with an altar boy falling asleep and dropping a crucifixed pole.",1,forgive me father for I have killed,985132800,"03 21, 2001",2001,2393,"['ineffectual', 'thriller', 'director', 'Fred', 'Walton', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'sleepwalking', 'way', 'role', 'priest', 'who', 'confess', 'serial', 'killer', 'unable', 'break', 'seal', 'silence', 'Catholic', 'church', 'imposes', 'confessional', 'use', 'Hitchcock', 'Confess', 'plot', 'different', 'here', 'confessor', 'not', 'identify', 'so', 'Sutherland', 'must', 'do', 'detective', 'work', 'compromising', 'situations', 'anonymous', 'confession', ""n't"", 'very', 'useful', 'thankfully', 'Sutherland', 'doing', 'something', 'away', 'turgid', 'non-affair', 'contemplating', 'Belinda', 'Bauer', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'Sutherland', 'pastor', 'practically', 'nothing', 'work', 'apart', 'one', 'line', 'why', 'Good', 'Friday', 'thought', 'be', 'good', 'when', 'was', 'day', 'Christ', 'died', 'scene', 'righteous', 'outrage', 'request', 'baptism', 'unwed', 'mother', 'hardliner', 'preferable', 'Sutherland', 'stupour', 'Sutherland', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'permissive', 'priest', 'when', 'Durning', 'quot', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'concerned', 'peace', 'mind', 'piece', 'ass', 'quot', 'performance', 'probably', 'best', 'defined', 'when', 'one', 'scene', 'head', 'staircase', 'handrail', 'self-reflective', 'exhaustion', 'amusing', 'contemplate', 'Bauer', 'choice', 'romantic', 'partner', 'someone', 'who', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'Walton', 'serial', 'killer', 'plot', 'far', 'too', 'leisurley', 'can', 'accept', 'numerous', 'rosaries', 'killer', 'mark', 'leave', 'one', 'wih', 'victim', 'spite', 'fact', 'already', 'have', 'one', 'being', 'clergy', 'people', 'murder', 'setpiece', 'logical', 'floor', 'eg', 'first', 'one', 'found', 'Sutherland', 'when', 'door', 'room', 'been', 'left', 'open', 'others', 'see', 'idea', 'someone', 'would', 'leave', 'suicide', 'scene', 'relative', 'untouched', '3', 'years', 'complete', 'broken', 'rope', 'knocked-over', 'stool', 'perhaps', 'taking', 'room-as-shrine', 'concept', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'even', 'allowing', 'activities', 'worshipper', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Sutherland', 'drinking', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'bar', 'obligatory', 'blowing', 'candle', 'victim', 'passes', 'However', 'Durning', 'laugh', 'when', 'suspense', 'built', 'up', 'red-herring', 'sequence', 'altar', 'boy', 'falling', 'asleep', 'dropping', 'crucifixed', 'pole']",N/A
