I was instantly hooked! So many things happened in one episode, nothing like the daytime dramas I used to watch on my lunch hour. I had also just read Ken Follet's ""When Giants Fall"" so it was fun to see some major similarities and hear some real historical names mentioned. So I wanted to see more because all I got to see was two Season 2 episodes and the season finale. I have never purchased a show on DVD but this one I had to. I went searching on Amazon and read the reviews about the differences between the UK version and the PBS version. Of course I had to have the original, uncut version! So I ordered this set and was able to set one of my DVD players to region free. Unfortunately it wasn't the DVD/LCD TV combo that I wanted to watch it on. There is no combination available to reset it at this time.I was expecting to see a real extended version of the episodes from Season 1 that I had seen from Netflix but I could not notice a difference. I was under the impression that this boxed set was the original, uncut version and I am enjoying them. I just cannot say that they are not the cut up PBS versions. Nowhere on these discs or packaging does it say PBS and it is for sure Region 1. Unfortunately I have not actually seen many episodes actually aired on PBS to attest that these discs are UK, original versions.There are many reasons people love this show. I cannot say why I love it except for the fact that it is basically a soap opera with great writers, actors, and it has some historical accuracies. My children even enjoy it and it doesn't make me embarrassed of humans (like reality tv does). So I am able to watch it without turning it off if they come in the room. Who would have thought I would be addicted to a Masterpiece Theatre? Who would have thought that millions of Americans would have been addicted to a Masterpiece Theatre show? I know there are many, many great ones. I have just never been sucked in so bad! I love it, can't wait till season 3, and I feel like I did when everyone was waiting for Thursday nights to watch a new episode of ""Friends"". It's that good! I hope no one reads this without seeing an episode. When everyone says something is amazing before I have actually experienced it, then I see it.....it is pretty much ruined for me. I can't see what the fuss is all about. Hopefully you are just here looking for the best version to help you get your fix like I was!",5,I can't believe how much I love this show!,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,2556,"['So', 'am', 'big', 'PBS', 'watcher', 'when', 'actually', 'watch', 'TV', 'happened', 'turn', 'one', 'Sunday', 'night', 'had', 'new', 'book', 'read', 'Wow', 'was', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'happened', 'one', 'episode', 'nothing', 'daytime', 'dramas', 'used', 'watch', 'lunch', 'hour', 'had', 'also', 'just', 'read', 'Ken', 'Follet', 'When', 'Giants', 'Fall', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'major', 'similarities', 'hear', 'real', 'historical', 'names', 'mentioned', 'So', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'got', 'see', 'was', 'two', 'Season', '2', 'episodes', 'season', 'finale', 'have', 'never', 'purchased', 'show', 'DVD', 'one', 'had', 'went', 'searching', 'Amazon', 'read', 'reviews', 'differences', 'UK', 'version', 'PBS', 'version', 'course', 'had', 'have', 'original', 'uncut', 'version', 'ordered', 'set', 'was', 'able', 'set', 'one', 'DVD', 'players', 'region', 'free', 'was', ""n't"", 'DVD/LCD', 'TV', 'combo', 'wanted', 'watch', 'combination', 'available', 'reset', 'time.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'real', 'extended', 'version', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'had', 'seen', 'Netflix', 'could', 'not', 'notice', 'difference', 'was', 'impression', 'boxed', 'set', 'was', 'original', 'uncut', 'version', 'am', 'enjoying', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'cut', 'up', 'PBS', 'versions', 'Nowhere', 'discs', 'packaging', 'say', 'PBS', 'sure', 'Region', '1', 'Unfortunately', 'have', 'not', 'actually', 'seen', 'many', 'episodes', 'actually', 'aired', 'PBS', 'attest', 'discs', 'are', 'UK', 'original', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'people', 'love', 'show', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'why', 'love', 'fact', 'basically', 'soap', 'opera', 'great', 'writers', 'actors', 'historical', 'accuracies', 'children', 'even', 'enjoy', ""n't"", 'make', 'embarrassed', 'humans', 'reality', 'tv', 'am', 'able', 'watch', 'turning', 'off', 'come', 'room', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'addicted', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'millions', 'Americans', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'addicted', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'show', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'great', 'ones', 'have', 'just', 'never', 'been', 'sucked', 'so', 'bad', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'till', 'season', '3', 'feel', 'did', 'when', 'everyone', 'was', 'waiting', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'watch', 'new', 'episode', 'Friends', 'good', 'hope', 'one', 'seeing', 'episode', 'When', 'everyone', 'something', 'amazing', 'have', 'actually', 'experienced', 'then', 'see', '..it', 'pretty', 'much', 'ruined', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'Hopefully', 'are', 'just', 'here', 'looking', 'best', 'version', 'help', 'get', 'fix', 'was']",N/A

So far we have two series, with a third promised which will take us up to the 1920s with doubtless more to come. This DVD set covers the first two series, with 16 episodes, 7 from the first series and 8 from the second and the Christmas special.The first series covered the period from 1912, just after the sinking of the Titanic, up to the start of the first world war in 1914 and much of the story line is about the matchmaking within the Crawley family where financial and social influences have a major bearing. Of course the interaction between the family and those who serve them `below stairs' is a continual contributor to the excellent story lines. The second series picks up two years on from the first series in 1916, in the middle of World War 1. Downton Abbey has been converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen and the action covers the period from the Battle of the Somme up to the end of the war. The Christmas Special is post the first world war and includes a dramatic trial. In both series topical events of the period, political, economic and military are covered.There are many superb individual performances but mention must be made of Maggie Smith. What a stroke of genius to cast her as Violet. She dominates every scene she appears in and often has some very funny lines.This box set will appeal to viewers who may have missed out first time round and also to the many who enjoyed this superb production and will want to revisit it.

Then mongo ran out of popcorn and all hell broke loose. He started yelling that he could not understand the actors and he asked why was I making them watch some foreign film.

1405592,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,B004G5Z0B4,Bruce G. Taylor,"[0, 1]","""Downton Abbey"" is certainly an attractive-looking series boasting a find cast of actors, including the great Maggie Smith.  I got though the first one and a half seasons and then, unfortunately, began to lose interest in it for reasons of credibility.  I fear some of the writers of this series had not done their homework regarding the time in which the story is set and I began to pick up a few anachronisms, here and there.This first glaring error I noticed was the case of the cook, Mrs. Patmore, I believe, who is portrayed as being stricken with cataracts.  Lord Grantham takes a personal interest in her plight and sees to it that she will be treated by one of the best  specialists of the day.  She is portrayed is having been successfully treated for the malady and, for a short time thereafter, is shown wearing a small pair of spectacles and later is shown as not needing any glasses at all.  The fact is, that while it was certainly possible to surgically remove cataracts at that time, the insertion of replacement lenses was still decades away.  The aftermath of her surgery would have required her to wear large, thick glasses to be able to see reasonably well for the rest of her life as was the case with my own Grandmother.In another scene I heard Lord Grantham make the remark that a certain character, ""..... has enough on his plate just now.""  I believe that is a fairly modern expression -- one that I never heard even twenty or so years ago.  At the time being represented, I would have expected the expression  to be ""...has enough on his mind just now"" or something similar.Also,  Lord Grantham is portrayed as being a goodhearted and kind gentlemen with notably liberal or progressive politics for a man of his time and position.  For him to show concern or personal interest for members of his serving staff would have been, at best, atypical for that time.  It is more likely that all orders to the members of the serving staff would have been communicated by means of the head butler, Mr. Carson, probably the only member of the serving staff with whom Lord Grantham would personally communicate other than his personal man-servant.  Most members of the lower level serving staff were regarded as not fit to even be seen by members of an aristocratic family.  .A more realistic portrayal of such a relationship can be seen in the film ""The Remains of the Day,"" a favorite film of mine.  In that story, the relationship between Lord Darlington and his head butler portrayed by Anthony Hopkins is rather more realistically represented.  Lord Darlington is portrayed as having some disdain for the lower classes and the Jews and some sympathies with the policies of the Third Reich -- not completely uncommon in England in the 1930s.  It was believed by some  British aristocrats, but of course not by all, that Adolph Hitler had the right ideas for maintaining order in his country.",3,Good Series But Has Its Oversights,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,2910,"['Downton', 'Abbey', 'certainly', 'attractive-looking', 'series', 'boasting', 'find', 'cast', 'actors', 'including', 'great', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'got', 'first', 'one', 'half', 'seasons', 'then', 'unfortunately', 'began', 'lose', 'interest', 'reasons', 'credibility', 'fear', 'writers', 'series', 'had', 'not', 'done', 'homework', 'regarding', 'time', 'story', 'set', 'began', 'pick', 'up', 'few', 'anachronisms', 'here', 'there.This', 'first', 'glaring', 'error', 'noticed', 'was', 'case', 'cook', 'Mrs.', 'Patmore', 'believe', 'who', 'portrayed', 'being', 'stricken', 'cataracts', 'Lord', 'Grantham', 'personal', 'interest', 'plight', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'one', 'best', 'specialists', 'day', 'portrayed', 'having', 'been', 'successfully', 'treated', 'malady', 'short', 'time', 'thereafter', 'shown', 'wearing', 'small', 'pair', 'spectacles', 'later', 'shown', 'not', 'needing', 'glasses', 'fact', 'was', 'certainly', 'possible', 'surgically', 'remove', 'cataracts', 'time', 'insertion', 'replacement', 'lenses', 'was', 'still', 'away', 'aftermath', 'surgery', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'wear', 'large', 'thick', 'glasses', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'reasonably', 'well', 'rest', 'life', 'was', 'case', 'own', 'Grandmother.In', 'scene', 'heard', 'Lord', 'Grantham', 'make', 'remark', 'certain', 'character', '..', 'enough', 'plate', 'just', 'now', 'believe', 'fairly', 'modern', 'expression', 'one', 'never', 'heard', 'even', 'twenty', 'so', 'years', 'ago', 'time', 'being', 'represented', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'expression', 'be', 'enough', 'mind', 'just', 'now', 'something', 'similar.Also', 'Lord', 'Grantham', 'portrayed', 'being', 'goodhearted', 'kind', 'gentlemen', 'notably', 'liberal', 'progressive', 'politics', 'man', 'time', 'position', 'show', 'concern', 'personal', 'interest', 'members', 'serving', 'staff', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'atypical', 'time', 'more', 'likely', 'orders', 'members', 'serving', 'staff', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'communicated', 'means', 'head', 'butler', 'Mr.', 'Carson', 'probably', 'only', 'member', 'serving', 'staff', 'whom', 'Lord', 'Grantham', 'would', 'personally', 'communicate', 'other', 'personal', 'man-servant', 'Most', 'members', 'lower', 'level', 'serving', 'staff', 'were', 'regarded', 'not', 'fit', 'even', 'be', 'seen', 'members', 'aristocratic', 'family', '.A', 'more', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'such', 'relationship', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'film', 'Remains', 'Day', 'favorite', 'film', 'mine', 'story', 'relationship', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'head', 'butler', 'portrayed', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'rather', 'more', 'realistically', 'represented', 'Lord', 'Darlington', 'portrayed', 'having', 'disdain', 'lower', 'classes', 'Jews', 'sympathies', 'policies', 'Third', 'Reich', 'not', 'completely', 'uncommon', 'England', '1930s', 'was', 'believed', 'British', 'aristocrats', 'course', 'not', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'had', 'right', 'ideas', 'maintaining', 'order', 'country']",N/A

While there is some truth in that view, it overlooks one key thing not just about Downtown Abbey but also British period dramas in general. Most of the beloved costume dramas from the UK have a strong streak of soap opera in them.This is as true of programs based on books like Brideshead Revisted and Poldark as it is of the show that Downtown Abbey most resembles - the original Upstairs Downstairs. It's also just as true of the first series of Downtown Abbey meaning that, while there was a distinct dip in quality between the first and second series, it would be a mistake to attribute it to the show suddenly becoming a soap opera. The real culprit seemed to be a lack of focus on the part of the writer, weaving in so many plot threads that not only was it was sometimes unclear which ones we should care about some of those we clearly are meant to focus on felt rushed such as the problems encountered by Mr. Bates late in the series.Despite that, you have to give credit to the actors for continuing to approach even the more preposterous plot lines with conviction. This is most apparent with Brendan Coyle as Mr. Bates whose dignified performance is a stark contrast with the sensationalistic storyline he's been given. Coyle also starkly contrasts with Maggie Smith as the Countess, whose role has largely degenerated into throwing out pretentiously pithy comments every so often whether the story calls for it or not.With the third series of Downtown Abbey premiering on PBS tonight, too long after its UK run for most American fans, the biggest question is not what will happen to Bates but rather whether it will be more like the first or the second. Whichever turns out to be the case, the new series is sure to have one thing in common with the previous ones, it will be the classiest soap opera on TV, and that's not a bad thing.",4,It Should Be Enjoyed for What It Is,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,2024,"['general', 'consensus', 'be', 'first', 'series', 'Downtown', 'Abbey', 'marvelous', 'British', 'period', 'drama', 'second', 'run', 'dipped', 'quality', 'turned', 'soap', 'opera', 'truth', 'view', 'one', 'key', 'thing', 'not', 'just', 'Downtown', 'Abbey', 'also', 'British', 'period', 'dramas', 'general', 'Most', 'beloved', 'costume', 'dramas', 'UK', 'have', 'strong', 'streak', 'soap', 'opera', 'them.This', 'true', 'programs', 'based', 'books', 'Brideshead', 'Revisted', 'Poldark', 'show', 'Downtown', 'Abbey', 'most', 'resembles', 'original', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'also', 'just', 'true', 'first', 'series', 'Downtown', 'Abbey', 'meaning', 'was', 'distinct', 'dip', 'quality', 'first', 'second', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'attribute', 'show', 'suddenly', 'becoming', 'soap', 'opera', 'real', 'culprit', 'seemed', 'be', 'lack', 'focus', 'part', 'writer', 'weaving', 'so', 'many', 'plot', 'threads', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'was', 'sometimes', 'unclear', 'ones', 'should', 'care', 'clearly', 'are', 'meant', 'focus', 'felt', 'rushed', 'such', 'problems', 'encountered', 'Mr.', 'Bates', 'late', 'series.Despite', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'actors', 'continuing', 'approach', 'even', 'more', 'preposterous', 'plot', 'lines', 'conviction', 'most', 'apparent', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'Mr.', 'Bates', 'dignified', 'performance', 'stark', 'contrast', 'sensationalistic', 'storyline', 'been', 'given', 'Coyle', 'also', 'starkly', 'contrasts', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Countess', 'role', 'largely', 'degenerated', 'throwing', 'out', 'pretentiously', 'pithy', 'comments', 'so', 'often', 'story', 'not.With', 'third', 'series', 'Downtown', 'Abbey', 'premiering', 'PBS', 'tonight', 'too', 'long', 'UK', 'run', 'most', 'American', 'fans', 'biggest', 'question', 'not', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Bates', 'rather', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'first', 'second', 'out', 'be', 'case', 'new', 'series', 'sure', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'previous', 'ones', 'will', 'be', 'classiest', 'soap', 'opera', 'TV', 'not', 'bad', 'thing']",N/A

Antic,"[1, 10]","Without eluding to any spoilers I have to say I am pretty much finished with this series and I would caution any American from buying it until they have reviewed Season 3 in it's entirety. This is turning out to be a show that should be watched, and not owned and here's why:##Season 1 gives us the drama you'd expect of a series like this, intrigue and social disasters. All par for the course and keeping you on the edge of your seat. Oh those on again-off again kids!##Season 2 is about WWI, and it is sad because War is sad. While characters come and go, you quickly see the creators had a bigger picture in mind and there was a reason for all the tears. Even though it's sad, it's worth a rewatch because the show respected the viewers even when it made choices fans didn't want.##Season 3 is sad because apparently this show was such an unexpected smash hit that the creators and/or the actors couldn't be bothered to finish it up or give it closure. If one disappointing and sudden departure after another wasn't bad enough the creator couldn't be bothered to put the show out of it's misery in a humane fashion. It was clear that some things were done for no reason and the creators did a poor job of making due. If this is what we had to look forward to I think viewers would have preferred the character be replaced with different actors/actresses. That really might have been the more acceptable thing here. I mean, it just gets that stupid.My husband bought me this for Christmas and I am very glad I didn't open it. I will be returning this unopened DVD shortly. Not in a fit or rage, not to punish the actors or the creator, but because it was SO GOOD and it drew you in so deep, so fast......only to end up sucking SO HARD. It's a strange kind of disappointment I'm not sure most viewers can ever forgive.

You can buy the Christmas Special by itself on Blu-Ray, but not on DVD. As the Christmas episode does further the story, I would hate to collect the series without the Christmas Special!We hadn't caught any ""Downton Abbey"" on TV, but bought this DVD set based on the praise the series had received, and the question everybody was asking after the Christmas Special (included in this set): Is John Bates going to hang? How could I resist a cliffhanger like that?At the beginning of season 1, it's 1912 and the prospect of WWI looms. But the denizens of Downton Abbey have other things to worry about. Such as meeting the stranger who will inherit the home out from under the family when the Earl leaves this Earthly plane. There are also tensions below stairs, as when John Bates joins the staff as the Earl's valet, but cannot perform all extra duties expected of him due to his war wound. A conundrum that causes problems yet today. If someone is disabled, you are sympathetic to his/her status, and don't want to deny them a living because of it. But if that person cannot undertake tasks that are then doubled on someone else - hard feelings are bound to arise.Spreading over both seasons is Lady Mary's scandal, which starts off hilarious - for the viewer, not for her.Season 2 starts in 1916. England has been at war for a year and a half. In January, 1916, England began forced conscription. In 1918, the Spanish flu began its course, killing 20 to 50 million people worldwide over the next two years. All of these affect Downton Abbey. But the plot line that takes over at the end involves John Bates and his wife. His odious loathsome wife.This is a review of the combined two-season set,Downton Abbey Seasons 1 & 2 Limited Edition Set - Original UK Version. Sometimes Masterpiece Theater-worthy series can be too drawn out, too much of little happening for a half hour at a time. But ""Downton Abbey"" is not one of those. Though there is plentiful character exploration, and there's a huge cast of characters to explore, the plotting is so excellently choreographed that we never got bored. As far as writing and dialogue, I thought ""Downton Abbey"" to be average for Masterpiece Theater. But as far as interesting characters and gripping plot-lines, this series is top of the line.Everything you've heard about Dame Maggie Smith's character is true. She has many of the best lines in the show. Totally irksome, annoying and maddening. But often the truthsayer, and she sometimes surprises.This 2-disc set has season 1 on the first disc. The second disc has season 2, the 2011 Christmas Special and the Limited Edition boxed set Special Features.Special Features:1.  Fashion and Uniforms (17 minutes) This consists of film clips interspersed with interview snippets with the cast and crew. Most of the people are talking on set, with actors usually in their costumes. Commentators include Rosalind Ebbutt (costume designer), Alistair Bruce (historical advisor), Anne 'Nosh' Oldham (hair & makeup designer), Rob James-Collier (plays Thomas), Hugh Bonneville (the Earl), Dan Stevens (Matthew Crawley), Susannah Buxton (costume designer), Penelope Wilton (Isobel), Jessica Brown Findlay (Sybil), Laura Carmichael (Edith), Michelle Dockery (Mary) and Zoe Boyle (Lavinia).Season 1 takes place in the post-Edwardian era, and the men wear tuxes and the ladies wear lovely beaded gowns over corsets - think Titanic style.The 2nd season starts in the middle of WWI. Before the war, women in trousers were common only in the fishing industry. This is the beginning of the ""panting"" of women in all walks of life, though it's unlikely that Lady Violet, Dowager Countess, ever resorted to pants.Though what is said in this special is interesting, it lacks depth, and with such a popular show, it's too bad BBC didn't have the funds to present something more comprehensive.2.  Romance in the Time of War (16 minutes) The format is the same as special #1, and apparently filmed at the same time. Many of the speakers in #1 also appear in this special, and there's new people: Julian Fellowes (writer and creator), Iain Glen (Richard Carlisle), Thomas Howes (William), Sophie McShera (Daisy), Lesley Nichol (Mrs. Patmore), Joanne Froggatt (Anna), Brendan Coyle (John Bates), and Phyllis Logan (Mrs. Hughes).It is hard for us to understand, now, how massive a break with the rules it was for Sybil to marry the chauffeur. The reactions seems overblown to us, but this was earthshaking to a family like the Earl's in that time.Zoe Boyle says that her hair took and hour and a half to set up every day. This is in part because she has an added hairpiece, but, still, it gives me an idea of why the ladies of that set couldn't do without a maid.3.  House to Hospital (13 minutes) Commentators include some also appearing in special features #1 and #2, with the addition of: Donal Woods (production designer), Gareth Neame (executive producer), Jim Carter (plays Mr. Carson), Dame Maggie Smith (Countess Violet) and Elizabeth McGovern (Cora).Most of the great houses of England were converted to some sort of wartime use. In real life, the families usually moved out of their mansions during their war-time incarnations. The producers needed the Earl's family to stay at home, of course, so they figured turning Downton into an officers' convalescence home would be more believable than if it had turned into a full-blown hospital.Though Season Two's war scenes are brief, they are in excellent juxtaposition to the trials and tribulations of the people at home. As Elizabeth McGovern says, ""You go from these horrific scenes of wartime in the trenches, with men being blown up. Then you cut back to these rather petty domestic battles that are being fought in the home front with every bit the passion and energy and commitment.""4.

It ranks in the British perfection class with Foyle's War. It's a Period Costume Drama series with plenty of mega-stars. The magnificent performance of Maggie Smith in a less-than leading role shines through every time she's on the screen (very often), even when she has no lines. Her facial delivery is comic. A paragraph could be written for almost every cast member, each seem to feed off the other in making this a remarkable period drama that takes the viewer back to the era, like it is real.Robert Crawley (Hugh Bonneville) is the man behind the estate, but it is Mr. Carson (Jim Carter), the butler, who keeps the house and social lives moving. There are 12 cast members that have a role in EVERY episode. Many more who miss just one or two. You fall in love with each in their own way, each a vital role in the make-up of this large family and servants. Not an issues is untouched, since every episode blends threads of intrigue, love, and history.The home, the countryside scenes, even WWI segments, the costumes, the sets, the music, the props, the...well, it's easier to say there is nothing about this series my wife and I have been even remotely disappointed with. If you don't own the original released DVDs this is a must buy. And with the rest of the world, you will then be awaiting season three, knowing it will be SIX-star worthy as well.

I had heard so much about Downton Abbey but thinking it only a soap opera had chosen not to watch it even though I normally loved PBS and most British or Canadian TV fare.  Finally, my sister and others urged me to give a try, but by that time the 3rd season was ending on PBS, so I decided to order seasons 1, 2, & 3 and watch from the beginning.  My sister and friends were right, I loved it.  It is a soap opera of sorts, but done a beautiful way, not only are the characters interesting but they are interwoven with real history and we are able to get a knowledgeable and informative glance at the past.  We see the passions, difficulties, and beauty of differing political and changing ideologies that infect some and inhibit others as it pertains to an ever-changing world and those caught in it.

Anyone with a brain knows that the show is a solid 10 on a scale of 1 to 5. My review is forthis particularDVD set.The pro is that you can get all of series 1 and 2 as well as the Christmas Special for one low price. There are a few select extras without any commentaries and that is about all.I don't know if it's a manufacturing issue, or if all are made the same way, but I was exceptionally disappointed as I watched the show. All of series 1 and parts of series 2 have serious color issues. Everyone's faces look so pale and sickly with red splotches all over their skin. It looks like everyone has the measles.Now I will admit that I have anew blu-ray player(which I love). However, I do not have this problem with other blu-ray discs. On the other hand, I have a very limited number of blu-ray discs since I'm just now getting into the blu-ray world.I'm reminded of the quality of the Pride and Prejudice DVD set that I bought as soon as it was first released on regular DVD (post the VHS world). It too had color wash out issues.Also, I am so disappointed in the lack of blu-ray features in this set. For Christmas, my husband bought methis setalong with the new blu-ray player. Maybe it was a bad set to start with, but it has such interesting features! One clever one is saving your favorite parts of the films. My assumption was that this was a standard, but perhaps not. Either way, I wish that a series so great as this one would have taken the time to infuse rich features like the Hitchcock set.It's worth noting too that if you purchase the separate series blu-rays (this oneandthis one), you'll likely (at present in any case) get a complimentary digital copy of the series via Amazon's Video Library. I actually bought them first, then cancelled those in lieu of this set. I'm very much regretting that decision now. This set does NOT come with a free video library copy.All in all, I'm gravely disappointed. Because it is a blu-ray I expected quality HD and that was what I did not get. The final disc worked fine, but not the others.

The early rising staff are busy as bees throwing open shutters to let in the morning light, lighting new fires in the fireplaces and straightening the large rooms from the use of the previous night.  Each person is weaving in and out among the others in a fast clipped pace to ready the rooms before the family members rise from their beds.

Beginning two years before the Great War, with the sinking of the Titanic, these first two seasons span the years 1912-1918 through the end of WW I. The series is set in the fictional Downton Abbey, a Yorkshire country house, the seat of the Earl and Countess of Grantham; and follows the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants during the reign of King George V. There is almost equal treatment of the Crawley's and their servants...a feature which I believe elevates the film to a much higher level than it would have held otherwise. The two big stars in the series are Hugh Bonneville, as Lord Grantham; and Maggie Smith, as Lord Grantham's mother, the Dowager Countess. They perform superbly, especially Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess, with her acerbic wit. The exchange above w/Lady Isobel Crawley (Penelope Wilton) is a case in point...sparks fly when these two are together.

I did, however, check around everywhere I could think of to find the best available copies. I had seen too many reviews about deleted scenes, the missing Christmas episode, and copies that still contained original commercials!(Incidentally, I've never understood why sellers or whoever would ever delete anything on dvds to be sold, except for commercials, of course. Naturally, I understand why tv would do this when it comes to fitting a movie/documentary, etc. into  a 2 hour time frame, for example.) It was a happy day for me when I saw this version on Amazon.Thank goodness! It was just what I wanted: closed captioning, no deleted scenes, no commercials, and the infamous Christmas episode was included! Furthermore, many extra ""behind the scenes"" parts were also included. If  you're interested in the best version available, this one is a & ""must have""! I, like so many others, couldn't stop watching! Very compelling with amazing characters (Don't even get me started on Maggie Smith), unmatched & beautiful scenery & sets, and a story with plenty of fascinating plot developments.

I love period dramas that fold into the larger historical situation. This series is full of them, tying in seamlessly to the sinking of the Titanic, the coming of electricity and motorcars, early women's rights movement. and WWI (so far - looks like the Depression will make an appearance in series 3).This is my favorite type of series because though it is mindful of the history its characters are living through, all of the main characters are fictional - so there's no specific history to get upset modern screenwriters fail to take into account. Here were some striking things to me...1) As tragic as we still feel the sinking of the Titanic was, the series gives one a bit of a glimpse of how overwhelming it was to people of certain social classes at the time. Losing so many heirs, friends, other family members, people they grew up with - all at once like that.2) the series takes on a very interesting period which is not covered very often (on the Royal level, Fall of Eagles is awesome telling the big story) where the world did in fact change. The whole of society was being uprooted as the 'modern world' emerged. Those who can't wait for the change interacting with those who want things to stay exactly the way they have always been - tons of opportunity for dramatic interactions.3) One of the easy-to-miss side stories is of Cora and her money. There were tons of American heiresses who married titles in England during this time frame - Consuelo Vanderbilt and Jennie Jerome (both, incidentally, married into the same family - the one that produced Winston Churchill). Lots of these relationships were miserable. I was glad to see this one; while not perfect, it is happy over the long run.4) LOVE Maggie Smith and her character. She seems to get all the curmudgeonly matron roles lately but this one is great. Tough and sarcastic on the outside, she has a heart of gold and is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.5) Finally, love the English terms we Yanks haven't picked up - but we should because we really don't have our own jargon that quite fits.

Dixon, Raleigh, NC, USA""","[19, 169]","2 stars for beautiful Highclere Castle and very good casting and acting; it would have been more except for the weak script and poor directing; this is no BBC Dickens series.For me, a web search on the characteristics a soap opera largely explains this movie.  I grew up with Soap Operas and hated them; my mother and all her friends loved them, knew all the actors and seemed to live some surrogate life through all the actors mood and personality changes that to me bordered on disorders.  According to the web, soaps have a continuous open narrative. Each episode ends with a promise that the storyline is to be continued in another episode.  They tend to focus their plots and story lines around dysfunctional family life, personal and sexual relationships, emotional and moral conflicts and rarely ""wrap things up"" storywise, and generally avoid bringing all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time. When one storyline ends there are always several other story threads at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliffhanger.I do wish the creators had ended the series in season 1 with an additional part, I'd have given 3 or 4 stars.There are allusions to Christian faith in the movie and there is a Biblical concept that ones life should have have love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.  What I see here are characters exhibiting hate, sadness, strife, impatience, spitefulness, relational fickleness, harshness and selfish impulsiveness and major, inexplicable personality changes.  In Season 2 Episode 8, my wife said at one point, ""The worm turns again.""  I am not looking forward to Season 3 and hope like some addict we don't watch it to see what happens to (the fellow with the problem); don't want to reveal the plot.  It seems the directors can only wreck some lives and characters or resurrect a couple of dead people (that has happened in Soaps before and once in this series) to keep it going.However, this being said, every woman I know, except my wife, who has an opinion about this movie, loves this it (I just have not heard from men I know, even though there are some mostly positive reviews by guys).  For the most part they are very fine people with high morals and seemingly good minds.  So maybe it is just about tastes.  For my taste, give me Dickens, Band of Brothers, Master and Commander, even Enchanted April or Howards End.

It was heartfelt, wonderful, delightful, entertaining, moving, exciting, funny, and most of all, intelligent.I'd heard some fans say that season two of Downton Abbey fell short a bit compared to the first season, but I hoped that perhaps I'd be amongst the fans that loved the second series as much as the first.At first, things were not looking good.  I found the first episode of season two felt a little rushed, and I was dissapointed that more time wasn't given to developing and introducing certain story arcs.  Episode two still felt a bit bumpy, but things were getting better.  Episode three felt back on form, and my husband and I watched on up until episode 6 with much delight.Then things began to fall apart.  It's difficult to say much without giving away spoilers, but the appearance of a mysterious wounded (and disfigured) solider who claims to have ties to the family was only the first of many utterly absurd plot-lines that I found myself utterly unimpressed by.  Episode seven, in particular, was so bad that it started to get funny.  My husband and I could not help but laugh as we pounded are fists and shouted at the characters ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!?""  There were some ridiculous plot-lines, many cases of characters acting out of character, and some really poor writing.The final episode did not have the effect on us that it might have had had it not come on the back of such a load of idiocy.  At least they spent the episode resolving some of that nonsense, so that hopefully they can make way for new (and better) story lines in season three.To fans new to this series, I'd honestly recommend you stick with season one and pretend that season two doesn't exist.  Season 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey can be brought separately - although you will save money buying them together in this box set - and I suggest you do just that and give this box set a miss.  I know I certainly don't want to ever subject myself to season two again, although I'll be more than happy to re-watch season one.  With season three on the way, however, it's still a bit too early to say whether this show has ""jumped the shark"" already, or whether season three can redeem itself and bring the show back to life.  I certainly hope it does, though I can't help feeling that Downton Abbey was not a series that was meant to run for many series'.Just a quick note as well, this set does not include the Christmas episode, which deals with events immediately after season two.  I've no idea why this is being sold as the ""complete"" collection, when it certainly is not.  The Christmas episode must be purchased separately, and is rather disgustingly priced for what it is.  I fail to understand why the Christmas episode was not included on this box set.",3,5 stars for season 1.  2 stars for season 2.,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,2820,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'positive', 'things', 'season', 'one', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'was', 'heartfelt', 'wonderful', 'delightful', 'entertaining', 'moving', 'exciting', 'funny', 'most', 'intelligent.I', ""'d"", 'heard', 'fans', 'say', 'season', 'two', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'fell', 'short', 'bit', 'compared', 'first', 'season', 'hoped', 'perhaps', ""'d"", 'be', 'amongst', 'fans', 'loved', 'second', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'first.At', 'first', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'looking', 'good', 'found', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'two', 'felt', 'little', 'rushed', 'was', 'dissapointed', 'more', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'developing', 'introducing', 'certain', 'story', 'arcs', 'Episode', 'two', 'still', 'felt', 'bit', 'bumpy', 'things', 'were', 'getting', 'better', 'Episode', 'three', 'felt', 'back', 'form', 'husband', 'watched', 'episode', '6', 'much', 'delight.Then', 'things', 'began', 'fall', 'apart', 'difficult', 'say', 'much', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'appearance', 'mysterious', 'wounded', 'disfigured', 'solider', 'who', 'have', 'ties', 'family', 'was', 'only', 'first', 'many', 'utterly', 'absurd', 'plot-lines', 'found', 'utterly', 'unimpressed', 'Episode', 'seven', 'particular', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'started', 'get', 'funny', 'husband', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'pounded', 'are', 'fists', 'shouted', 'characters', 'WHAT', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'DOING', 'were', 'ridiculous', 'plot-lines', 'many', 'cases', 'characters', 'acting', 'character', 'really', 'poor', 'writing.The', 'final', 'episode', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'effect', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'had', 'not', 'come', 'back', 'load', 'idiocy', 'least', 'spent', 'episode', 'resolving', 'nonsense', 'hopefully', 'can', 'make', 'way', 'new', 'better', 'story', 'lines', 'season', 'three.To', 'fans', 'new', 'series', ""'d"", 'honestly', 'recommend', 'stick', 'season', 'one', 'pretend', 'season', 'two', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Season', '1', '2', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'separately', 'will', 'save', 'money', 'buying', 'together', 'box', 'set', 'suggest', 'do', 'just', 'give', 'box', 'set', 'miss', 'know', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ever', 'subject', 'season', 'two', 'again', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'happy', 're-watch', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'three', 'way', 'however', 'still', 'bit', 'too', 'early', 'say', 'show', 'jumped', 'shark', 'already', 'season', 'three', 'can', 'redeem', 'bring', 'show', 'back', 'life', 'certainly', 'hope', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'was', 'not', 'series', 'was', 'meant', 'run', 'many', ""series'.Just"", 'quick', 'note', 'well', 'set', 'not', 'include', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'events', 'immediately', 'season', 'two', ""'ve"", 'idea', 'why', 'being', 'sold', 'complete', 'collection', 'when', 'certainly', 'not', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'must', 'be', 'purchased', 'separately', 'rather', 'disgustingly', 'priced', 'what', 'fail', 'understand', 'why', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'box', 'set']",N/A
