The ""usual"" bonus material is found in the box as well as in the DVDs.This time the box comes with a pillow case with the girls of the SOS Brigade strewn in a lax manner. Would it really be used as a pillow case? Doubtful. It's definitely for decoration considering the size.The dubbing was enjoyable, with most intonations (intonation? is that the word I'm looking for?) kept intact or at least how it would be in English. The subtitles are still that 1990's yellow with black border. Oh well, that can't be helped (have you seen a fansub? Very pretty typeface).Here's to Bandai for an overall nice entry and and a nod to the fans!",4,Penultimate Review,1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,721,"['Packaging', 'as', 'pretty', 'ever', 'third', 'installment', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'series', 'usual', 'bonus', 'material', 'found', 'box', 'as', 'well', 'DVDs.This', 'time', 'box', 'pillow', 'case', 'girls', 'SOS', 'Brigade', 'strewn', 'lax', 'manner', 'Would', 'really', 'be', 'used', 'pillow', 'case', 'Doubtful', 'definitely', 'decoration', 'considering', 'size.The', 'dubbing', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'intonations', 'intonation', 'word', ""'m"", 'looking', 'kept', 'intact', 'least', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'still', '1990', 'yellow', 'black', 'border', 'Oh', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'helped', 'have', 'seen', 'fansub', 'Very', 'pretty', 'typeface', 'Bandai', 'overall', 'nice', 'entry', 'nod', 'fans']",N/A

This review concerns Volume 3 of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.BLUF: Worth every pennyDetails: If you're reading this - then you already know the story behind this anime.  (If not, I won't spoil the series here.)  Watching this series in Broadcast Order is essential to appreciating it.  Volume 3 of the Limited Edition box set includes a second DVD with the second installment of the series in Broadcast Order (sorry Dub Fans, it's Subtitled Only).  It also includes a CD with Music from the series that is actually an imported version of a CD sold on the open market in Japan - and if you like the music in this show, you'll want this CD.  Finally, there's beautifully drawn insert that has the show's characters in various poses on both sides that's printed on plastic (it's actually very nice) and other goodies in the box.So is it worth paying extra for this version versus the Regular Edition.  ABSOLUTELY.  It's actually a great value:-Same DVD you get with the regular edition (price varies - but $8.00 as of this writing)-Vol. 2 of the series in Broadcast Order (not available anywhere else - even Japan)-Haruhi Suzumiya Character Songs Volume 1 (about $25 from Amazon Japan depending on the Dollar/Yen rate)-Other goodies thrown in for good measureAdditionally, if you haven't watched this series yet - there's enough depth to this show that you'll get something different out of every viewing.This series has my strongest recommendation.",5,One of the Best of Recent Anime Series (Volume 3),1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,1551,"[""'re"", 'Anime', 'Otaku', 'understand', 'what', 'Anime', 'Otaku', 'then', 'series', 'review', 'Volume', '3', 'Melancholy', 'Haruhi', 'Suzumiya.BLUF', 'Worth', 'pennyDetails', ""'re"", 'reading', 'then', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'anime', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'series', 'here', 'Watching', 'series', 'Broadcast', 'Order', 'essential', 'appreciating', 'Volume', '3', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'box', 'set', 'second', 'DVD', 'second', 'installment', 'series', 'Broadcast', 'Order', 'sorry', 'Dub', 'Fans', 'Subtitled', 'Only', 'also', 'CD', 'Music', 'series', 'actually', 'imported', 'version', 'CD', 'sold', 'open', 'market', 'Japan', 'like', 'music', 'show', ""'ll"", 'want', 'CD', 'Finally', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'insert', 'show', 'characters', 'various', 'poses', 'sides', 'printed', 'plastic', 'actually', 'very', 'nice', 'other', 'goodies', 'box.So', 'worth', 'paying', 'extra', 'version', 'Regular', 'Edition', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'actually', 'great', 'value', '-Same', 'DVD', 'get', 'regular', 'edition', 'price', 'varies', '8.00', 'writing', '-Vol', '2', 'series', 'Broadcast', 'Order', 'not', 'available', 'anywhere', 'else', 'even', 'Japan', '-Haruhi', 'Suzumiya', 'Character', 'Songs', 'Volume', '1', '25', 'Amazon', 'Japan', 'depending', 'Dollar/Yen', 'rate', 'goodies', 'thrown', 'good', 'measureAdditionally', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'series', 'yet', 'enough', 'depth', 'show', ""'ll"", 'get', 'something', 'different', 'viewing.This', 'series', 'strongest', 'recommendation']",N/A

While I didn't particularly like the extras that came with it, but they were definitely welcome. Even after watching many other anime besides this, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya series still stays in my top five anime of all time, because of its crazy antics, good comedy, and unique characters. It is also one of the few anime I actually enjoyed hearing in English as well. Although the voice actress for Haruhi sounds a bit off, the other English voice actors used are excellent.",5,The essential Haruhi,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,607,"[""'re"", 'interested', 'Melancholy', 'Haruhi', 'Suzumiya', 'should', 'pick', 'up', '6', 'excellent', 'deal', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'extras', 'came', 'were', 'definitely', 'welcome', 'Even', 'watching', 'many', 'other', 'anime', 'Melancholy', 'Haruhi', 'Suzumiya', 'series', 'still', 'top', 'five', 'anime', 'time', 'crazy', 'antics', 'good', 'comedy', 'unique', 'characters', 'also', 'one', 'few', 'anime', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'English', 'as', 'well', 'voice', 'actress', 'Haruhi', 'bit', 'other', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'used', 'are', 'excellent']",N/A
