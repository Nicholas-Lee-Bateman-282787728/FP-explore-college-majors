I watch pretty much anything. However, this film, well, It takes itself way too seriously to be any good to anyone! I personally feel that we need to find another intrinsic fear these days other than any story surrounding a  Zombie apocalypse. Overkill with no pun intended. Fast zombies, slow zombies, tied up & loved family zombies that still require feeding, demonic zombies, true love zombies, curing zombies, killing zombies, genetically grown zombies, intelligent zombies, zombies that remember, unborn or baby zombies, pet zombies, militarized zombies, space zombies, Natzi zombies,  or almost any other combo has been accomplished.
