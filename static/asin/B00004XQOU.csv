557458,AKV8PGQECV5O7,B00004XQOU,a consumer,"[35, 44]","This whole project would have been better had Burns stuck to what was probably his initial goal--to make a documentary on the social history of jazz.  I say ""social history"" because that's what Burns' other documentaries are about, it's where his interests lie, and it's what he's good at.  The problem is that people know something about the Civil War, they know how baseball is played, but they don't know anything about jazz.  Neither did Burns, for that matter, by his own admission.  So, in order to make a documentary about the ""dance between the races"" (I think that's the term he used) in American society, as manifested in jazz,  Burns had to teach the audience (and himself) about the music of jazz as he went along. To do this he enlisted the aid of consultants from Jazz at Lincoln Center--Wynton Marsalis, Albert Murray, and Stanley Crouch.Somewhere along the way the whole thing started to see itself as a massive music appreciation project.  But if I were going to put together a user-friendly and inviting introduction to the sometimes-daunting world of jazz, I certainly wouldn't do the following:  (1) crank out a 20-hour production that can try the patience of even the most passionate jazz fan (2) taint the whole discussion with a highly judgmental slant about what constitutes ""true"" jazz (i.e. the controversial views of Murray, Crouch and Marsalis) (3)rigidly enforce the ""true jazz"" ideology by censoring the selection of musicians featured and trashing unfavored musicians (like Miles)--a real Soviet technique, when you think about it (4) clutter all the musical discussion with all of the social history.This documentary has lots of great footage, and sometimes despite itself it has some good commentary (e.g. Gary Giddens), and even the social history part is pretty good.  The historic interaction between black and white musicians/audiences is a rich topic usually ignored by the bulk of the American public.  Burns did a decent job of introducing the topic. But if you're wanting to learn about the music, well--like I say, it's a heck of a way to welcome someone into the world of jazz, to drag them into an ideologial dispute and to trash some of the legendary figures of the art.  All the slick production values and inviting visuals can't cover up the ugliness of this mean-spirited side of the documentary.If you want a piece of the Ken Burns party, then just buy the ""Best of Ken Burns Jazz"" CD--it's about $13.  Then buy the book ""Jazz 101""  by John Szwed, which is complete, non-partisan, and a great introduction to jazz.  Listen to it all and decide for yourself what you like.  Later you can plunge into all the culture wars you want  to (or not).",3,"Decent Social History, Bad Intro to the Music",1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,2691,"['whole', 'project', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'Burns', 'stuck', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'initial', 'goal', 'make', 'documentary', 'social', 'history', 'jazz', 'say', 'social', 'history', 'what', 'Burns', 'other', 'documentaries', 'are', 'where', 'interests', 'lie', 'what', 'good', 'problem', 'people', 'know', 'something', 'Civil', 'War', 'know', 'how', 'baseball', 'played', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'jazz', 'did', 'Burns', 'matter', 'own', 'admission', 'So', 'order', 'make', 'documentary', 'dance', 'races', 'think', 'term', 'used', 'American', 'society', 'manifested', 'jazz', 'Burns', 'had', 'teach', 'audience', 'music', 'jazz', 'went', 'along', 'do', 'enlisted', 'aid', 'consultants', 'Jazz', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'Albert', 'Murray', 'Stanley', 'Crouch.Somewhere', 'way', 'whole', 'thing', 'started', 'see', 'massive', 'music', 'appreciation', 'project', 'were', 'going', 'put', 'together', 'user-friendly', 'inviting', 'introduction', 'sometimes-daunting', 'world', 'jazz', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'following', '1', 'crank', '20-hour', 'production', 'can', 'try', 'patience', 'even', 'most', 'passionate', 'jazz', 'fan', '2', 'taint', 'whole', 'discussion', 'highly', 'judgmental', 'slant', 'what', 'true', 'jazz', 'i.e', 'controversial', 'views', 'Murray', 'Crouch', 'Marsalis', '3', 'rigidly', 'enforce', 'true', 'jazz', 'ideology', 'censoring', 'selection', 'musicians', 'featured', 'trashing', 'unfavored', 'musicians', 'Miles', 'real', 'Soviet', 'technique', 'when', 'think', '4', 'clutter', 'musical', 'discussion', 'social', 'history.This', 'documentary', 'lots', 'great', 'footage', 'sometimes', 'good', 'commentary', 'e.g', 'Gary', 'Giddens', 'even', 'social', 'history', 'part', 'pretty', 'good', 'historic', 'interaction', 'black', 'white', 'musicians/audiences', 'rich', 'topic', 'usually', 'ignored', 'bulk', 'American', 'public', 'Burns', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'introducing', 'topic', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'learn', 'music', 'well', 'say', 'heck', 'way', 'welcome', 'someone', 'world', 'jazz', 'drag', 'ideologial', 'dispute', 'trash', 'legendary', 'figures', 'art', 'slick', 'production', 'values', 'inviting', 'visuals', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cover', 'up', 'ugliness', 'mean-spirited', 'side', 'documentary.If', 'want', 'piece', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'party', 'then', 'just', 'buy', 'Best', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Jazz', 'CD', '13', 'Then', 'buy', 'book', 'Jazz', '101', 'John', 'Szwed', 'complete', 'non-partisan', 'great', 'introduction', 'jazz', 'Listen', 'decide', 'what', 'like', 'Later', 'can', 'plunge', 'culture', 'wars', 'want', 'not']",N/A

I am a big fan of Ken Burns - it made me look at Baseball in a totally different way, and I'm not even a sports fan.

I would just say it might not grab someone that isn't into the topic.  Ken Burns often ties subjects into the wider picture of American History - Baseball is about more than Baseball, the National Parks have a greater significance than pretty things to look at.

There is, however, some tremendous historical footage throughout documenting the life and times of 20th Century America.After the completely absorbing qualities of Burns' first two works, one has come to expect better than this.  He states at the outset that he doesn't know much about Jazz Music.  It shows...and he picked some sadly biased &quot;experts&quot; with strangely slanted viewpoints upon which to rely.  While Winton Marsalis performs admirably trying to describe musical motivation it's ironic that, like so many contemporary artists, Marsalis is a flawless technician but lacks the depth of soul of the very people he is trying to explain.  As one musician pointed out, ""If you don't make any mistakes your not doing the best you can `cause you're not pushing the edge of the envelope"".The series might better have been called &quot;The Rise of the Holy Black Empire According to Ken&quot;.  Many of the musicians interviewed stated that skin color just didn't matter since the bonds fostered by the music transcended mere pigmentation. Yet, Burns continually plays the race card (in this case note) as if intentionally looking to add to the divisiveness which was already so omnipresent in the piece!His misinformation and omissions are staggering!  As one who has been strongly involved with Jazz for more than 40 years, I can say with some authority that Louis Armstrong (pronounced &quot;Louie&quot; not ""Lewis"") was, in fact, a great entertainer but only a fair trumpet player and interesting song stylist - NOT &quot;The most important, influential figure in the history of Jazz&quot;.  St. Louis is a town...not a musician!  How can one discuss Jazz and innovation without mentioning the likes of Stan Kenton, Bill Evans and in terms of dedication to spreading the music, the great pianist Dr. Billy Taylor?  What happened to the incredible Blue Note sound created by Alfred Lion and primarily engineered by Rudy VanGelder between the mid 50s and late 60s?  While Burns focused his lens on scenes of chaos and turmoil...feeling threatened by the likes of The Beatles...he missed some terrific musicians and a lot of really great music!Jazz didn't die during the 70s...it evolved and Burns ran out of reference material!  Throughout the series, he seeks to promote a number of comparatively mediocre players along with The Greats while managing to ignore some of the even Greater!  By the way, while Frank Sinatra was not technically a Jazz singer, Jazz did form his roots.  How can he be summarily dismissed with a brief honorable mention as &quot;That skinny singer from the Tommy Dorsey Band?&quot;  Are you kidding?  Like him or not, Frank became bigger than any other name their production geniuses came up with during the whole 19 hours!  Burns should have stuck with a topic he DOES know about.

557464,A23YNMZ945GQ9B,B00004XQOU,"Andrew Hopkinson ""andrew@tdg.ca""","[7, 9]","I think the addition of that one word would solve a lot of contreversy. If you look at the series that way, then it's pretty good, hence the 4 stars. Burns would have been wiser to have added that word, then the omition of fusion, avant-garde, electronic jazz et al could be forgiven. Of course, it's not quite as snappy and ""epic"" sounding, which is the aim of this series, bombarding you with so much detail of so many seemingly insignificant events and the glorification to deity status of some very excellent musicians (Armstrong, Ellington, Parker) that you think you are witnessing the birth of civilization itself.So to all the people that mourned the abscence of guitar players, keep in mind that the guitar as a solo instrument did really come to the for in Jazz until the 50's, with the widespread use of amplifiers, which is near the tail end of traditional jazz.The choice of Marsalis has been criticized, but it's understandable because he is the one contemporary jazz musician that most people have heard of, and yes he is an accomplished player, he's also a good speaker and pleasant to look at, which is more important for a documentary, albeit the accuracy may have been somewhat sacrificed.It would be nice to see a ""Ken Burns Jazz: part II"" with all the missing elements from this series, but that probably won't happen. I liked the fact that he did include a pretty balanced view of many movements, and the contreversies that were happening at the time, too many times you read history as ""first there this movement, then came this movement"" thinking that it's very block like and orderly. It's good that he mentions that a lot of people didn't like the direction that be-bop took Jazz, that it turned jazz into music for musicians, that you couldn't dance to it anymore or even understand it. I found this interesting since it's a very similar to the way the classical music evolved into intelectual constructs that were lost on the average listener. I think that's what so fascinating about the swing era, is that the music was both technically complex and fun to listen to. That to me is the best music can achieve. Other conflicts are mentioned, such as the beat poets naive and simplistic view of Jazz music, that in the words of Ginsburg ""anyone can pick up an axe and let it out"". Uh yeah, have you tried Mr. Ginsburg? It aint that easy, trust me.The series does get bogged down after a while, and if you're not a horn player (i'm a pianist and guitarist) you will soon get barraged with a seemingly endless string of rapid fire sax/trumpet solos, which to me, I'm ashamed to say, all the sound the same. The glossing over of avant-guarde is a shame, but is expected, after all, the majority of the viewers that Burns is targeting probably don't have a taste for this music and he knows it. I am musician and I actually agree with Branford Marsalis' view that it's ""self-indulgent bullsh*t"", cause it is. And yes, I've done it, and frankly the whole experience is empty and devoid of musicality. Same with jazz fusion, much of it is pretentious indulgent garbage, and no it's not because I don't understand it, or because I'm a snob, I DO understand it and that's what makes it all the worse.Anyway, to sum up, take the series for what it is, if you are interested in traditional acoustic jazz and don't know much about it, you might find it worth while.

However, I suppose the black part of the story, which is the bigger part, has been slighted all too frequently in the past. So this enabled us to grasp that portion of the story more fully then ever before.  There are wonderfully human stories throughout about the people in jazz and those were among the best parts of the series, such as Duke Ellington's relationship with his mother and with Billy Strayhorn plus the bittersweet final musical number played between Billie Holliday and Lester Young and their soon-after deaths. It's hard for me to see how you would not enjoy this series despite the key musical artists it leaves out and despite its perspective on who was great.

The Civil War documentary certainly is rife with factual inaccuracies but by & large gets the essential story of the conflict right.  ""Jazz,"" on the other hand, treats its subject as though the last 40-50 years never happened.  It is as though the Civil War documentary would have lingered over the years 1861-1863 incessantly, then sped through the last two years (""Oh yeah, there were a couple of battles, Atlanta burned, Lee surrendered, the war was over.  The end.""  Something like that) as though they didn't matter.As I found the documentary going into its umpteenth hour and we STILL weren't out of the 1930's yet, I had a bad feeling about where this was going.  You would have thought that Louis Armstrong had been annointed as the Jazz Pope and he ruled over the world of jazz for 40 years.  In his proper context, Armstrong is very important, but Burns seems positively fixated on him.  He dwells on every facet of Armstrong's upbringing & early career.  Unless he planned on making a 60-hour documentary, there was no way Burns could hope to do justice to the more recent history of the genre, and sure enough he basically hits the fast forward button once the be-bop era is coming to a close.Personally, I cannot stand fushion jazz, but nonetheless some mention needs to made of a style that was dominant in jazz for almost as long as the swing style, for crying out loud.  Also, relying almost exculsively on Wynton Marsalis (doing his best impression of a crochety old man on his front porch, railing at a world that has passed him by) really was not a good idea & imbues the entire documentary with a hopelessly retrograde flavor.I watched it once, and came away disappointed.  I watched it a second time, hoping that I could find more to appreciate, but only found that it continued to disappoint.

557475,A3JNICYJRSVGA9,B00004XQOU,Comic Online,"[4, 4]","What i really enjoyed about this series was how in-depth it went on the origins of jazz.  As a musician (not professional) myself, and a lover of jazz myself, there was a lot i didn't know about the pre-1920 story of jazz.  The 19th Century Creole culture in New Orleans was quite fascinating to me.The series has many detractors, who consider themselves the 'jazz snobs.'  They seem to think that only the 'noobs' enjoy this series.  If that's true, it's only because they are looking for something that was never intended to be there.  Their feeling is that more recent (post 1960 or so) jazz developments were given little screen time.  Well...yeah.  Duh.In most of his multi-part documentaries, Ken Burns is not trying to do an in-depth analysis of the subjects' current merits, so much as tell the history of it, heavily-slanted on the origin story.  People can discuss the merits of hard bop or fusion ad nauseam, and that would take away from what this film was trying to present.  Did you notice how much time was spent on the origins of jazz from the 19th Century, years before jazz was even a musical style?Further, in doing a history of jazz, he also presents a picture of the culture that surrounds jazz.  Since jazz was the number one music in the late '20s, '30s and early '40s, he spent the vast amount of time in that period.  As the popularity of jazz greatly diminished with the rise of rock and soul music in the '50s, so did this documentary's focus on it.The basic thing to remember is that Ken Burns was trying to create a picture of the American landscape of popular music, which happened to focus on the jazz age.  When jazz became a small sub-culture, the story had essentially been told.  Think of it like one of the great American Experience presidential biographies on PBS.  How much time are you going to spend discussing Jimmy Carter (or Ike, LBJ, Truman) after he left the presidency?  Sure, he did things, and was still a figure in foreign relations for decades.  But his story was no longer central. Ken Burns told that story.  If there had been a 10-part follow-up to this series, it would have likely focused on rock 'n' roll, not jazz.  And i bet the first 8 episodes would have been focused on pre-1970, and rightly so.This film is not designed to give in-depth analysis of the modeern jazz scene and styles of the current day.  It is an origin story.  Ken Burns paints very classic American stories.  Baseball.  National Parks.  The Civil War.  And yes, Jazz. What he is going to focus on is the time period that those things were a dominant part of American culture.That all said, while i sometimes found Wynton Marsalis to be insightful, he often became annoying for his wild romanticism of jazz music.  His poetic, and often long-winded cranial meanderings became a bit tedious after a while.",4,"Excellent series, though a little romanticized",1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,2833,"['What', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'was', 'how', 'in-depth', 'went', 'origins', 'jazz', 'musician', 'not', 'professional', 'lover', 'jazz', 'was', 'lot', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'pre-1920', 'story', 'jazz', '19th', 'Century', 'Creole', 'culture', 'New', 'Orleans', 'was', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'me.The', 'series', 'many', 'detractors', 'who', 'consider', ""'jazz"", 'snobs', 'seem', 'think', 'only', ""'noobs"", 'enjoy', 'series', 'true', 'only', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'there', 'feeling', 'more', 'recent', 'post', '1960', 'so', 'jazz', 'developments', 'were', 'given', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'Well', 'yeah', 'Duh.In', 'most', 'multi-part', 'documentaries', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'not', 'trying', 'do', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'subjects', 'current', 'merits', 'so', 'much', 'tell', 'history', 'heavily-slanted', 'origin', 'story', 'People', 'can', 'discuss', 'merits', 'hard', 'bop', 'fusion', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'present', 'Did', 'notice', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'origins', 'jazz', '19th', 'Century', 'years', 'jazz', 'was', 'even', 'musical', 'style', 'Further', 'doing', 'history', 'jazz', 'also', 'picture', 'culture', 'jazz', 'jazz', 'was', 'number', 'one', 'music', 'late', ""'20s"", ""'30s"", 'early', ""'40s"", 'spent', 'vast', 'amount', 'time', 'period', 'popularity', 'jazz', 'greatly', 'diminished', 'rise', 'rock', 'soul', 'music', ""'50s"", 'so', 'did', 'documentary', 'focus', 'it.The', 'basic', 'thing', 'remember', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'was', 'trying', 'create', 'picture', 'American', 'landscape', 'popular', 'music', 'happened', 'focus', 'jazz', 'age', 'When', 'jazz', 'became', 'small', 'sub-culture', 'story', 'had', 'essentially', 'been', 'told', 'Think', 'one', 'great', 'American', 'Experience', 'presidential', 'biographies', 'PBS', 'How', 'much', 'time', 'are', 'going', 'spend', 'discussing', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'Ike', 'LBJ', 'Truman', 'left', 'presidency', 'Sure', 'did', 'things', 'was', 'still', 'figure', 'foreign', 'relations', 'decades', 'story', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'central', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'told', 'story', 'had', 'been', '10-part', 'follow-up', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'focused', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'not', 'jazz', 'i', 'bet', 'first', '8', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'focused', 'pre-1970', 'rightly', 'so.This', 'film', 'not', 'designed', 'give', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'modeern', 'jazz', 'scene', 'styles', 'current', 'day', 'origin', 'story', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'paints', 'very', 'classic', 'American', 'stories', 'Baseball', 'National', 'Parks', 'Civil', 'War', 'yes', 'Jazz', 'What', 'going', 'focus', 'time', 'period', 'things', 'were', 'dominant', 'part', 'American', 'culture.That', 'said', 'i', 'sometimes', 'found', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'be', 'insightful', 'often', 'became', 'annoying', 'wild', 'romanticism', 'jazz', 'music', 'poetic', 'often', 'long-winded', 'cranial', 'meanderings', 'became', 'bit', 'tedious', 'while']",N/A

Burns missed a whole bunch of music, because he was playing the puppet to Marsalis. If only he had Miles to tell him what it was all about.  You see, when Miles was playing in the 40's they didn't call it Jazz, they called it music. But the critics coined it that term. So what we got was Wynton's documentary.  They left off people who were about an important change in ""music"" during the late 60's and early 70's. No mentioned of Weather Report (Zawinul, Shorter DB Hall of Famers) Return to Forever (Corea, White, Dimeola, Clarke), Mahavishnu Orchestra (Cobham, Mclaughlin, Hammer), Lifetime (Tony Williams, Larry Young) and Herbie Hancock Headhunters. The documentary failed to mention how these guys and more form the fusion area changed the course of music not just jazz history. Failed to mention how Miles brought all these guys together to record the process of making music and how all these world class musicians from all over the world (no racism) would learn who to play best with for their future groups.But the purist say if they are playing electric instruments then it aint jazz, Well that's too sad.

So, there is something to offend nearly everybody; but much much to delight many as well. It was a noble effort, however flawed. Television, misleading and basically untrue medium that it is, is seldom better. That in itself merits praise.The mastermind behind &quot;Jazz&quot; is not Ken Burns. He is the producer, and knew nothing of jazz five years ago. The philosophy and history of jazz is largely directed and inspired by trumpeter and band leader Wynton Marsallis, for better or worse. The take is that jazz is essentially black music, which is often appropriated by while interlopers. The gods of jazz, for Marsallis, are Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. There is some truth in this. Benny Goodman was not the &quot;King of Swing.&quot; That title should have gone to Duke Ellington or Chic Webb or Fletcher Henderson, Goodman's forebears. With considerable talent, he popularized their ideas. However, talent in jazz is not a matter of pigment, but of soul, of brilliance, of spirit. That is colorblind. That is a Gift.Moreover, it is a stain on American history that many great, black jazz musicians could not stay in the hotels in which they brilliantly performed and had difficulty breaking into management and record production. As with &quot;Baseball,&quot; &quot;Jazz&quot; often addresses the themes of race and class in America--so much so that one often wishes there were more pure music in this long series. The only complete cut, I believe, is a short Billy Holiday blues piece in which she touchingly reconciled with Lester Young. Why not a full piece by the classic Coltrane Quartet on &quot;Jazz Casuals&quot; or something similar?I would have appreciated more comments by Nat Hentoff, a key jazz writer in the bebop and beyond period. (He is also an excellent newspaper columnist.) Gary Giddens is consistently insightful and worth hearing, especially on Coltrane and Armstrong.Then there are the omissions. There is nothing on the blind, multi-instrumentalist (who played several reed instruments at once) and steller improvisor Roland Kirk. Although he is arguably the best living jazz guitar player, Pat Metheny is omitted (as is most of the last forty years of jazz). We find nothing on the recently departed innovator and virtuoso of the trombone, J.J. Johnson. There is nothing on the highly creative and passionate playing of multi-reed player (and bandmate of John Coltrane), Eric Dolphy. If Burns cut out about about ten-fifteen minutes of Pops, there would have been some room for these esteemed cats.I hope the effect of this series will be to revitalize interest in and love for jazz, the best uniquely American art form. Jazz ranks near last in music sales today, sadly. Consider the garbage (Eminem!) that outsells it. But jazz has a great history and is not dead; it has a future. Just listen to Joshua Redmond, James Carter, Branford Marsallis, or Pat Metheny... And watch &quot;Jazz&quot;--critically, but appreciatively.--Douglas Groothuis",4,Long live jazz!

557485,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,B00004XQOU,Earl Hazell,"[36, 42]","Let's start with the criticisms and get them out of the way. For one, what you may have heard about Ken Burns skipping a great deal of the past four decades of the history of Jazz is true. He did that, ostensibly, in order to focus on the existential continental drift initiated by the invention of ""Free Jazz"" by saxophonist Ornette Coleman in 1961, and what that has meant for both the future of the music and its very definition. But yes, the overarching presence of Wynton Marsalis and ""the bull in the African-American intellectual's China Shop"" writer Stanley Crouch (the Wagner/Nietzsche duo of the jazz world) is evidence that the condensing of the past forty years onto one disk (or a little more than two of the nineteen plus hours of this documentary) is actually a function of their philosophy.  Not, per se, any embryonic one of Ken's (who said repeatedly he knew little of the subject matter before taking this on) or the foundational perspective of every jazz musician. Crouch and Marsalis' perspective (as many know) to a large degree excludes much of what happened after 1961 via declaring it not legitimately being part of the art form that is Jazz.My second complaint--a more important one: the glory of doing a documentary on a living art form is that there are so many seminal artists of it still performing today, let alone still living and wanting to talk about it. It was amazing to hear such special communicators like Wynton, Stanley Crouch, Gerald Early, Giddins, Jon Hendricks, Branford, Charlie Parker's first drummer Stan Levy, Artie Shaw, or Bird's widow Chan Parker and the like share powerful insights and stories.  Yet it could not replace--or even equal in retrospect--the value of hearing from even more living musicians than he interviewed throughout the documentary.  For example (if not especially), Max Roach (who I have performed with in New York and Europe, still lives in midtown Manhattan, and is arguably modern jazz' most important percussionist.  He is inexplicably absent from this collection, despite his 60 year Protean career and overarching influence being featured on more than two of the ten chapters of this documentary). Or, Jimmy Heath (who took over Coltrane's spot in one of Miles Davis' 50's combos and with whom I studied jazz composition in college: brilliant). Or the incomparable Oscar Peterson: the ultimate jazz pianist link to both the genius of Art Tatum and the early stride pianists of the teens and 20's, connecting us to the dawning of the art form in New York. Or pianist Ahmad Jamal: possibly the biggest influence on the artistry of Miles Davis. Or Dr. Billy Taylor, pianist protege of Ellington--to say the least about his career. Or Sonny Rollins, who is prominently featured on one chapter, and is still gigging around the country--probably as you read this. Or BOBBY MCFERRIN, the Coltrane of jazz singing today, who is unconscionably not mentioned at all in the entire series. Or ORNETTE COLEMAN HIMSELF--the subject of the schism of jazz in its entirety seen on the ninth disk....I could go on; and so could most jazz musicians.The final critique is the history of heroin and drug use in jazz after the 30's Swing period, told brilliantly by Burns throughout the Be-bop and post Be-bop era discs. Told brilliantly, yes. However, the previous disks  consistently and responsibly put all of the seminal figures of the art form's quixotic behavior and troubled lives into the profoundly definitive context of the racism and morally schizophrenic social fabric of the 20th century in America.  When drugs came up, little to nothing was said about where exactly this heroin trade originated (nationally and internationally speaking), how it began inexorably coming into the Black communities, via what clandestine criminal organizations, etc.  In other words, it wasn't for my taste responsibly linked to the same social dynamics he previously underscored.All that said, you simply have to see this entire series to know, despite me giving you a bunch of paragraphs worth of b**ching, why this documentary is worth SIX stars.Ken Burns will be the subject of a documentary himself in the not too distant future, to be sure. His genius in putting this entire series together--blending the drama, pathos and emotional panoramic of great film storytelling with the attention to the historical detail and objective character study of documentary--is, as far as I know, unparalleled.The portrait of Louis Armstrong alone is worth the price of the entire set. Before this DVD series I thought I knew what his contribution to American culture was. Now I know Armstrong was among the greatest of us all, INCLUDING Mark Twain AND the Founding Fathers. Burns work on Ellington, also, will help you lay to rest any difficulty you may have with hearing Duke compared to Copland, Gershwin, Bernstein and all the rest of the American composers--and be found to tower above them. And Burns' work on the early days of jazz is almost overwhelming.And then there is Wynton. Wynton's work on this set is nothing short of poetic. There are moments where his perspectives are so eloquently rendered on camera (even for him) that it nearly forces you to agree with them if you didn't already. There are other moments, while explaining the significance of singular people and the incomprehensible beauty of this music, where he bares his this-is-why-I-play-jazz soul...and you come off feeling as if you are a better person from just listening to it.  In one of the later discs, Wynton explains that what keeps musicians playing, giving their entire lives to Jazz, is that it gives them ""a taste of what America will be when it becomes ITSELF.""""...and it WILL become itself...that's a sweet taste man.""Ken Burns' JAZZ--like Jazz itself--is high art.

I am a Jazz educator, a Jazz musician, and have spent alteast the past 10 years researching the history of the music for my own self pleasure.  -- I am also a tough critic, and have found many documentaries in the past to SKIM the surface... this one doesn't.  Although it doesn't exactly present anything new or rewrite the history (though you would have to spend years and years to pull a similar quantity of facts together, and you'd probably never get your hands on all the rare footage), it really digs down into the roots and sounds.  Because there is so much content and it is so voluminous, the DVD (as opposed to VHS) format seems ideal to make it easy for referential navigation, though each episode is so brilliantly woven, I can't see anyone really wanting to jump around that much.Though in the past I haven't been a big Marsalis fan, his commentaries and narratives SHINE as do the other critics.  Burns tells the story of Jazz socially, culturally, historially... from the perspective of nation, community, individual, style, race and more.  Not since Leonard Feather wrote The Encyclodpaedia of Jazz has a more important contribution to the history of the music been made.TIPS :  For purposes of referential nagigation, consider the DVD.

After reading several reviews about this series on this page, I wonder if jazz should be added to that list.In terms of background in the jazz genre, I fall somewhere between the wide-eyed jazz neophyte critics say this series was aimed at and the graying veteran who spends two or three nights a week listening to live fusion jazz or who rages at creator Ken Burns' exclusion of an obscure might-be bepop avatar.And from that vantage point, I think Jazz is pretty darn good.Of course I was puzzled by some of the choices Mr. Burns made in producing this film, the exclusion of some artists and derivative movements and the time spent on others. I raised my eyebrows at the heavy reliance on Wynton Marsalis' views and commentary, the long discussions about race, the glossing over of the modern era.My point is not to defend these aspects but only to say that it is easy to find fault in something of this scope. Producing this series was a mammoth undertaking: it is 19 hours of artfully done film, culled from thousands of hours of interviews, footage, and music. I cannot imagine anything of this scale being produced without also producing a legion of critics, and Jazz certainly proves that point. But I also fail to come up with any other single source where the viewer can see, hear, and learn so much about the greatest American art form.There is more to recommend it: this DVD collection includes a host of interactive features that make further learning and listening easy. In a specific DVD mode, viewers who click on the name of a song when it appears on the screen find that the film stops and a list of all the musicians who contributed to the piece appears, along with the recording studio, the year of production and other miscellaneous tidbits. I discovered that each song on each DVD is individually tracked, making it easy to jump from one to the other. Furthermore, the ""extras"" section includes three stunning full-length performances not included in the film (my favorite is Duke Ellington's ""C Jam Blues"") and a well-done 15-minute documentary on how the film was produced.",4,Jazzmataz,1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,2190,"['old', 'saying', 'one', 'should', 'never', 'talk', 'religion', 'politics', 'polite', 'company', 'reading', 'several', 'reviews', 'series', 'page', 'wonder', 'jazz', 'should', 'be', 'added', 'list.In', 'terms', 'background', 'jazz', 'genre', 'fall', 'somewhere', 'wide-eyed', 'jazz', 'critics', 'say', 'series', 'was', 'aimed', 'graying', 'veteran', 'who', 'two', 'three', 'nights', 'week', 'listening', 'live', 'fusion', 'jazz', 'who', 'creator', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'exclusion', 'obscure', 'might-be', 'bepop', 'avatar.And', 'vantage', 'point', 'think', 'Jazz', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good.Of', 'course', 'was', 'puzzled', 'choices', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'made', 'producing', 'film', 'exclusion', 'artists', 'derivative', 'movements', 'time', 'spent', 'others', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'heavy', 'reliance', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'views', 'commentary', 'long', 'discussions', 'race', 'glossing', 'modern', 'era.My', 'point', 'not', 'defend', 'aspects', 'only', 'say', 'easy', 'find', 'fault', 'something', 'scope', 'Producing', 'series', 'was', 'mammoth', 'undertaking', '19', 'hours', 'artfully', 'done', 'film', 'culled', 'thousands', 'hours', 'interviews', 'footage', 'music', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anything', 'scale', 'being', 'produced', 'also', 'producing', 'legion', 'critics', 'Jazz', 'certainly', 'point', 'also', 'fail', 'come', 'up', 'other', 'single', 'source', 'where', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'greatest', 'American', 'art', 'more', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'collection', 'host', 'interactive', 'features', 'make', 'further', 'learning', 'listening', 'easy', 'specific', 'DVD', 'mode', 'viewers', 'who', 'click', 'name', 'song', 'when', 'screen', 'find', 'film', 'stops', 'list', 'musicians', 'who', 'contributed', 'piece', 'recording', 'studio', 'year', 'production', 'other', 'miscellaneous', 'tidbits', 'discovered', 'song', 'DVD', 'individually', 'tracked', 'making', 'easy', 'jump', 'one', 'other', 'Furthermore', 'extras', 'section', 'three', 'stunning', 'full-length', 'performances', 'not', 'included', 'film', 'favorite', 'Duke', 'Ellington', 'C', 'Jam', 'Blues', 'well-done', '15-minute', 'documentary', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'produced']",N/A
557493,A30ZIGG3JM3YSH,B00004XQOU,Eric Koldinger,"[13, 17]","Ken Burns Jazz does a decent job of introducing jazz, but suffers from many defects that keep it from being great.  This is an interesting way to learn about the early history of jazz, in particular in the social context of how the music was evolving.  Being a middle-class white guy from the West Coast, I really didn't have much exposure to many of the social movements that went on during the first half of the century.  From that point of view it's an enligtening show, but it's neither a great jazz documentary, nor a great social history documentary.Jazz also does a reasonable job of exposing the various schools and movements within Jazz.  If you want to know where Bebop fit in the grand scheme of things, and who it's main practioners were, it's a decent way to find that out.However, too much of this is focused on the early history of Jazz.  As many have noted, Mr. Burns jams everything from 1960 onwards into one episode, after devoting a episode to nearly every 5 year period before that.  It's a little too much of Wynton Marsalis' viewpoint that the only real jazz was the early stuff.Mr. Burns spends far too much time with the Great Man theory as well.  Louis Armstrong comes into just about every episode, even when he was no longer a major innovative force in the music.  Duke Ellington is similarly constantly mentioned.  Other musicians drift in and out of the picture, usually to much lesser degrees.  While hanging the series off of Louis Armstrong's life is an interesting way to frame things, it's really rather limiting.  Many great and influential musicians never get mentioned at all.  Miles Davis is almost glossed over, Nina Simone never shows up at all.  Can't remember hearing Cannonball Adderly's name anywhere.  And if they came of age after 1970, they're lucky to have a their name mentioned at all.All in all, if you know nothing about Jazz and you'd like to learn a rough history, this is a reasonable introduction.

557495,A1L0HZI35HF8OF,B00004XQOU,Eric V. Moye,"[28, 41]","Gerald Early once said that in the future, America would be known for three things -- the Constitution, Baseball and Jazz.  This is the second effort by Ken Burns of this aptly named &quot;American trilogy&quot; and another outstanding documentary made by one of Mrs. Burns very talented sons. JAZZ is a worthy next step, and admirably follows his earlier work.The genre which Burns has mastered is best characterized by the ability to take still photographs and transfer them seamlessly to another element based upon movement.  He is able to do so here as in Baseball and The Civil War admirably.  Burns integrates stills as well as old film footage with music and interviews.  The series is wonderfully narrated with the deep baritone of Keith David.  Ossie Davis and a host of other narrators combine to offer their eloquence.  Contrary to what some other critics say, Wynton Marsalis does a terrific job as a second narrator.  I don't know (and don't care) what his educational background is (unlike another), but he certainly knows the techniques of jazz almost as well as he knows the luminaries Burns profiles.  Most importantly, as Burns is able to explain the import of some performers, Marsalis dissects the music first in words, and then with his horn.  Without this technique, we would have nothing but words to explain that Dizzy Gillespie &quot;doubled up&quot; when he played melodies on his trumpet.  With Marsalis, it comes alive via his playing.  This gives insights that no words ever could.The tragedy which seems to have befallen many great jazz musicians, like the story of Charlie Parker is positively heart-rending.  He and Lady day diedlooking twice their natural age.  It is too bad that Burns (like any other man) could not discover why so many jazz giants had substance abuse problems.  When Keith David goes through the litany on musicians who were destroyed (or at least wounded) by narcotics, it is nothing short of a who's who of jazz music.Damn the critics!  This is great work.  One complains about the length.  Another complains because a personal favorite is left on the cutting room floor.  Some are upset because Louis Armstrong was lauded, while others complain because his influence is somehow not adequately explained, like this was some junior high school essay.  Of course, those reviewers who complain about the discussion of race could complain that a documentary about World War Two made more than passing critical reference to those pesky, misunderstood Nazis.Name one artist who was allegedly not given his props, and there are two here justifiably.  The haunting melodies made famous by Billie Holiday are well represented, as is the earthy classic Ethel Waters.  The Duke is as smooth and majestic as his nickname implies.  Another two hours would have been well spent on him.  Double that for Louis Armstrong, rightly called a gift from the jazz gods, and in spite of the critics, every artist seemed to acknowledge his influence.Of course, it only took a few minutes of listening to his oh-so-sweet horn to make plain the reason why.  Like another, I thought that the three minutes of Louis Armstrong's &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; were worth the price of the discs.

Maybe they are one and the same, but while I was captivated by the series, I was sensitive to the possibility that many were over glorified. Regardless, I came away with a whole new appreciation for this genre of music. During the series, I listened closely to the music to appreciate the genius of the music itself, and came away thinking while I might have wanted to dance to the music, I cannot imagine sitting around a radio and listening for hours.  I find other music, like classical music, more inspiring.  Maybe this is why I give 4 out of 5, because in the end, I will never buy a Jazz record to just enjoy the sound.  No so when I study classical music. What impressed me most was the musicians improvisations, making it up as they went along.

557500,A6QMY5WPTVAT1,B00004XQOU,"Gregory J. Casteel ""Dr. Gregory J. Casteel""","[2, 3]","I am hesitant to even begin writing this review.  After all, Ken Burns' ""Jazz"" has become one of the great treasures of modern American documentary filmmaking.  It's so famous that it's hard to believe that there's anyone out there who hasn't already seen it, or at least heard of it.  Reviewing this film series is a bit like reviewing one of Shakespeare's plays or one of Mozart's operas:  What can I possibly add that hasn't already been said by countless others whose views are better informed, and whose words are more eloquent, than mine?  After all, I am a jazz lover, but am no expert on the history of jazz.  And, while I devour documentaries like candy, I am certainly not a professional film critic.  My opinions of this film series are simply those of an enthusiastic layperson with very little background in the subject, not those of a scholar or artist.  So, why bother writing a review and exposing myself as a philistine who knows next to nothing about either jazz or documentary filmmaking?  Because, after finally purchasing the DVDs, and re-watching this series for the first time since it originally aired on PBS more than a decade ago, I can't resist the temptation to gush over how much I thoroughly enjoyed it.I'm not going to suggest that this is a perfect documentary series.  Other reviewers, as well as professional critics who actually know what they're taking about, have pointed out its many shortcomings.  But, in spite of all its flaws, it's still an absolute delight to watch.  First of all, it's entertaining.  Every episode is packed full of some of the best jazz music that has ever been made.  In addition to the music, you will hear many wonderful anecdotes -- some hilariously funny, some touchingly sentimental, and some tragically sad -- about the most famous people and venues in the history of jazz music.  And these are illustrated with a selection of old photographs and film clips that help bring the stories to life.  But, in addition to being entertaining, it's also very informative.  You'll learn about the history of jazz, and how the history of jazz is really the social and cultural history of the United States.  Jazz is America in musical form.  It is our national zeitgeist made audible.  Jazz tells the story of the American experience, and especially the African American experience, better than any other art form.  There is no more faithful expression of the American character -- with its seemingly paradoxical blend of rugged individualism and community spirit, love of freedom and need for order, passion for innovation and reverence for tradition -- than you find in jazz.  Jazz is the best expression of what it means to be American.  One might even be tempted to say that it's impossible to fully understand what America is all about without at least some understanding of what jazz is all about.  And if you want to understand what jazz is all about, Ken Burns' wonderful documentary series is a good place to begin.Yes, as the critics are quick to point out, this documentary gives an incomplete, and perhaps somewhat distorted, picture of the history of jazz.  First of all, it focuses mainly on the heyday of jazz in the 1920s, '30s, and '40s, and devotes considerably less time and attention to later developments in jazz.  Also, since Ken Burns takes a biographical approach to his historical documentaries, much of this series is devoted to chronicling the lives and careers of some of the biggest names in the history of jazz -- Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, etc. -- while other great jazz musicians are covered only briefly, if at all.  A number of critics found this approach unsatisfactory, some even going so far as to accuse Ken Burns of elitism.  But, while these criticisms might be well-intentioned and, at least in some cases, valid, I think they ultimately miss the point of what Ken Burns' ""Jazz"" was trying to do.  In my (admittedly ill-informed) opinion, this documentary series was never intended to be a comprehensive, scholarly socio-cultural history of jazz music in all its diversity, with a detailed analysis of the individual contribution of every significant jazz musician in history.  Rather, it seems to me that this was meant to be a celebration of a wonderful style of music that is quintessentially American, whose history is inextricably entangled with the history of America, and whose story is, in essence, the story of the American (and, in particular, the African American) experience.  The purpose of this documentary was not simply to inform the viewer about what happened when, and who did what.  Rather, its main goal was to help the viewer understand -- emotionally as well as intellectually -- that jazz is the sound of America.  When viewed this way, many of the criticisms that have been leveled against it over the years just seem tiresomely pedantic.The bottom line is that, watching Ken Burns' ""Jazz"" really inspires a greater appreciation of this music and the people who made it, and makes you realize just how much this music reflects the true heart and soul of America.  No, it's not a perfect documentary series.  But that's okay, because jazz itself has never been about technical perfection.  The best jazz musicians aren't necessarily the ones who consistently hit all the right notes.  Rather, the best jazz musicians are the ones who consistently put all the right feelings into whatever notes they do hit.  This film series may miss a few notes here and there; but it puts all the right feelings into every note it hits.  (Plus, Keith David should narrate everything.  His voice and delivery are amazing.)Perhaps the best thing I can say about Ken Burns' ""Jazz"" is that, after my recent re-watch, I have fallen even more deeply in love with jazz, and with the films of Ken Burns, than I already was.  Lately I've been listening to jazz a lot more than usual, and shopping around for more recordings to fill in the gaps in my jazz collection.  And I've also added a bunch of Ken Burns documentaries to my wish list, which I'll probably be ordering soon.  So, if you want my advice (there's no reason you should; but I'm gonna give it to you anyway), ignore what the critics have to say:  This is one of the best documentary film series you'll ever see in your life.  Get it.  Watch it.

557501,A3MQVJ1JNGHDSP,B00004XQOU,"Henry  Cooper ""&#34;Still One Me&#34;""","[4, 8]","Pretty to say this is one of my favorite documentaries I have seen on PBS. I first watch this since they did stories on Duke, Coltrane, Miles (who is my inspiration), Count, Herbie, Billie, Satchmo, Dizzy, Bird, Ornette, Wynton and on and on which told by the narration of himself, Mr. the actor Keith David. Keith David was a good speaker when he narrated the history and culture that going besides jazz. I appreciate on what he accomplished and look forward of him doin' more of this on other documentaries in the future. Yeah Keith will live on my heart for now on 'cause he good with that baritone kinda voice.Anyway, as I was saying this a good documentary whether you love it or hate it, I think it's talking about what jazz became popular in the United States. Artists like Satchmo aka Louie Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald became the first to create that generation. Same with others like Dizzy, Bird, Coltrane, Davis, Count, Billie, Ornette, Blakey, Wynton, Freddie, Herbie Hancock, Clifford, and many others who created that sound of jazz.Like to say I'm a huge jazz fan and I'll always gonna live around it until the day I die. I'm especially a trumpet player so I know the details about it. One of the things I worried is that a lot of people are missing out some information about it. Simple, they don't read books about it or else pick up some albums from them that made it. I think the matter of it is we should learn to appreciate how we put into our music today like in R&B;, hip-hop, rock, gospel and all kinds of music that are playing right now all have a feature on where we left off back in those days.This is definitely a must-have who wants to read or learn more about it.

557502,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,B00004XQOU,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[2, 2]","I enjoyed this 10 volume documentary by the legendary director/producerKen Burns, but my only point of contention is that it isn't all emcompassingand completely ignores some pivotal figures & eras in jazz while bearlyscanning over others. Of course I do understand the editing process as wellas the huge costs for bringing in more interview subjects and all of the legaland logistical nightmares of putting something like this together, so I'm notgoing to be too harsh in my assessment of Mr. Burns' overall product.It is still very entertaining and interesting, the subjects (artists) he does cover,along with the accompanying music of classic jazz fare of the 20's, 30's, 40'sand up to the early 70's were done well. Though people like Wes Montgomery were ignored,Django Rheinhardt was only eluded to for a few seconds, Bessie Smith too, Billy Strayhorne'sbrilliance outside of his collab with Duke Ellington wasn't emphasized enough for me.Too bad also, he didn't include a more in depth analysis of the 70's jazz fusion movementother than Miles Davis' ""Bitches Brew""...would've been nice if Roy Ayers Ubiquity,Lonnie Liston Smith, Spyro Gyra, Return To Forever, George Duke, Norman Connors and otherswho were prominent in the mid 70's to early 80's had got some face time too!As for singers, Sarah Vaughn was only touched on, Dinah Washington was ignored,as was Dakota Stanton, Big Maybelle, Anita O'Day, Nancy Wilson, and male singers likeLittle Jimmy Scott, Al Jarreau, Billy Eckstine and Joe Williams were left out too.Some in depth coverage on latin and afro cuban jazz would've been nice too.But to take on the whole story of JAZZ is an ambitious undertaking to say the least!I guess someone was always going to be disappointed in some way, and he only had10 chapters to work with to try to weave this epic story into something cohesive.All-n-All though, I give it 4 Stars.",4,"Entertaining & Interesting, But Not Fully Encompassing Of Jazz!!",1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,1883,"['enjoyed', '10', 'volume', 'documentary', 'legendary', 'director/producerKen', 'Burns', 'only', 'point', 'contention', ""n't"", 'emcompassingand', 'completely', 'pivotal', 'figures', 'eras', 'jazz', 'bearlyscanning', 'others', 'course', 'do', 'understand', 'editing', 'process', 'wellas', 'huge', 'costs', 'bringing', 'more', 'interview', 'subjects', 'legaland', 'logistical', 'nightmares', 'putting', 'something', 'together', ""'m"", 'notgoing', 'be', 'too', 'harsh', 'assessment', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'overall', 'product.It', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'subjects', 'artists', 'cover', 'accompanying', 'music', 'classic', 'jazz', 'fare', '20', '30', ""40'sand"", 'up', 'early', '70', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'people', 'Wes', 'Montgomery', 'were', 'ignored', 'Django', 'Rheinhardt', 'was', 'only', 'eluded', 'few', 'seconds', 'Bessie', 'Smith', 'too', 'Billy', ""Strayhorne'sbrilliance"", 'collab', 'Duke', 'Ellington', 'was', ""n't"", 'emphasized', 'enough', 'me.Too', 'bad', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'more', 'depth', 'analysis', '70', 'jazz', 'fusion', 'movementother', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'Bitches', 'Brew', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'Roy', 'Ayers', 'Ubiquity', 'Lonnie', 'Liston', 'Smith', 'Spyro', 'Gyra', 'Return', 'Forever', 'George', 'Duke', 'Norman', 'Connors', 'otherswho', 'were', 'prominent', 'mid', '70', 'early', '80', 'had', 'got', 'face', 'time', 'too', 'singers', 'Sarah', 'Vaughn', 'was', 'only', 'touched', 'Dinah', 'Washington', 'was', 'ignored', 'was', 'Dakota', 'Stanton', 'Big', 'Maybelle', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'Nancy', 'Wilson', 'male', 'singers', 'likeLittle', 'Jimmy', 'Scott', 'Al', 'Jarreau', 'Billy', 'Eckstine', 'Joe', 'Williams', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'too.Some', 'depth', 'coverage', 'latin', 'afro', 'cuban', 'jazz', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'too.But', 'take', 'whole', 'story', 'JAZZ', 'ambitious', 'undertaking', 'say', 'least', 'guess', 'someone', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'way', 'only', 'chapters', 'work', 'try', 'weave', 'epic', 'story', 'something', 'cohesive.All-n-All', 'give', '4', 'Stars']",N/A
557503,A3GZFBXB2VOGI0,B00004XQOU,H. Lim,"[16, 19]","I knew nothing about jazz.Zero. Zip. Nada.I had heard the word ""jazz"", of course; and, when my parents forced me to play the electric organ, I (with great difficulty) had to play ""In the Mood"" for a music exam. In the back of the music book was a piece called ""Watermelon Man"" by this guy called Hancock; there was something by someone called Duke, I can't remember what it was.When this series came on, I, as a history student, was aware of Ken Burns' ""The Civil War"", which had moved me powerfully (probably, again, because I knew almost nothing about that particular war at the time). I therefore tried watching an episode or two.What I remember most about this series is that it is a drama. That's all there is to it. It is not an attempt to summarise the music. It is as subtly crafted a drama as ""The Civil War"" was. It is possible to make any subject seem dull - even jazz and the American Civil War. But to make it seem interesting - nay, interesting enough that it remains in the mind as a supreme moviegoing experience - now that is difficult.One thing I remember from the series is, in one episode, this guy saying that he had bought a Louis Armstrong disc when he was a kid, and listened just to one side over and over for six months straight. Then he turned the disc over - and the first thing on the other side was West End Blues. Which was a masterpiece beyond anything else on the disc, which he didnt know then. (Immediately the viewer is made interested). Then he describes taking it to a music professor, I can't remember where, and he says he played West End Blues for him. The professor said to play it again. He played it again. Then there was a long silence; and the professor says ""I think that was the most perfect three minutes of music I ever heard"". (By now the audience is gawking: wow!)BUT - the ingenious thing is: Cut to an image of an old 78 player. What is this? Cut to a closer image of it. Can it be? And YES - we can read the label: WEST END BLUES. Holy Cow!!! Then a hand looms into the frame...the disc begins to spin...a stylus is lowered...And the entire three minutes of West End Blues is played!!!Yes indeed - this is truly dramatic bliss. Ken Burns builds up to this point over the preceding couple of shots, in order to bring the viewer almost to a fever pitch.There is another moment, a little more personal here. I had watched about five episodes of the series, with very little interest in the music, frankly - even in Louis Armstrong - and by the time the swing era came I was drifting - I wasn't paying attention...Then in the last scene of the last swing episode...an image of an atom bomb (Nagasaki, I think) comes up on the screen...And over the top of this horrible image is a sound I've never heard before - a sound that immediately caught my attention after hour after hour of corny swing tunes. I had never heard anything like this. Images begin to come up on the screen of small nightclubs and saxophone players. The name Charlie Parker is mentioned - never heard the name. A guy called Dizzy looks like a beatnik. The narrator describes in awed tones a great *revolution* happening in jazz. The audience is leaning forward. The sounds grow weirder - hard to define for someone untutored in music - the rhythms are all weird, and harmonies are all over the place. The sound of a saxophone is almost overwhelmingly fast and witty. What is this??!!And the episode ends. To be continued.The following week, I waited feverishly for the next episode. A word is mentioned; Bebop. Never even heard of it. But this is the episode that turned me on to jazz. The way it is made, the way the drama is created, and the newness of the sounds - new to ME, too, after hearing bland dance music for the preceding episodes - was stunning. I was in exactly the same position as the people in the 40s. All the jazz I had ever heard was contained in the preceding episodes. It was astoundingly powerful - I could *hear* the revolution, myself, in my lounge room.I found a new obsession.To people who already know about jazz, this series is filled with flaws - perhaps even fatal flaws. But to an untutored Australian, who knew zero about the music, it seemed like a pretty darned dramatic experience. In fact, I would be prepared to call it powerful. Maybe even great. I have rarely been so interested in a historical documentary, or so eager to see the next episode. I was humming St Thomas by Sonny Rollins for two weeks straight; I am now obsessively listening to Coltranes ""My Favourite Things""; I am now a certifiable jazz fan.Jazz is such a bitchy and divisive art form nowadays, that any documentary like this is bound to offend 75% of fans. Admittedly, too, I haven't seen the last episode, which supposedly dismisses everything anyone has done since 1967 including Herbie Hancock and Miles Davis' later works. That's a bit off.But from all that I have seen of the series, I'd like to recommend this series to anyone who knows nothing about jazz; particularly the bebop episodes.",5,A View from

Lund ""jazzbrat""","[159, 186]","After several days of marathon video viewing, I'm happy (and relieved) that, despite some inevitable imperfections, JAZZ: A FILM BY KEN BURNS is an amazingly broad and detailed exam of the music's history. Despite having read many excellent jazz-related books, I think that video rather than the printed word is the preferred medium to get initial or even remedial exposure to the music, because here you have as the centerpiece the actual audio and video of the art and artists. If you read a book about jazz, you don't have that essential evidence of the music itself, but merely descriptions of it.Why buy the DVD? There is a minor amount of extra footage. More significantly, the program can be altered so that whenever a piece of music appears, one can display the discographical info. As such, one never has to wonder what they are listening to. Furthermore, the sharpness of the DVD video picture and clearness of the audio is a selling point, particularly when you're looking at vintage photos, videos, and audio that are often not in optimal condition. Plus, with the DVD you can watch the series at your own pace.I might have thought beforehand that a series which takes six hours just to get to Armstrong/Hines' 1928 landmark recording WEST END BLUES might be a little too obsessive. Yet I remained riveted to the television screen as jazz's history unfolded, from Buddy Bolden to Cassandra Wilson.  Jazz has a VERY compelling history on many levels--emotionally for one given the periodic mist in my eyes.  I would have preferred a bit less commentary over the clips of jazz's great artists, but occasionally Burns does let the music speak for itself. I was impressed that we get to know a lot of the primary artists in a fair amount of detail. The likes of Armstrong and Ellington (but surprisingly not Miles Davis) are followed from the beginning to the end of their lives.My first significant exposure to jazz was in the 1970s, and I believe that if this series has an achilles heel, it is that jazz's impact on contemporary popular music could have been examined, which would have provided younger generations a logical entry point that we can relate to, irregardless of our prior degree of exposure to jazz.  Instead, the impression-by-omission left here is that jazz has virtually no ties to contemporary pop culture, which I strongly dispute. I think the majority of the viewers of this program are ultimately going to be those who reached adulthood in the 1970s or later, and there is so much that could have been exposed to these generations to indicate that jazz is not a museum piece, but has significant links to contemporary popular culture.

As as a musician, I found the series perplexing. Why has Ken Burns, who has access to so many brilliant theorists, limited his scope exclusively to the opinions of the &quot;Wyntonites&quot;?

Unfortunately, as with any historical survey, certain things get left out.  First of all, the series focusses heavily on earlier jazz (20s through 40s), and pays much less attention to later decades.  Second of all, even once the series has reached later decades, they continue to devote time to the stars of earlier jazz (Satchmo, et al) and how they are faring in later times.  While I agree that this is important, I think more time could have been spent on any number of 60s and 70s artists rather than hearing more about Lady Day and the like.Nonetheless, Burns manages to bring us a well-edited combination of live clips, interviews, and narration with still photographs.  Anyone would have trouble addressing the issues I outlined above in only 10 discs.However, I think the film REALLY suffers from one main problem:The series is heavily biased by Wynton Marsalis and his famed mentor/jazz critic, Stanley Crouch.  This is not to say that these two very influential men have any sort of malicious agenda, but rather that Burns relies far too heavily on their vision of jazz.Because of this subtle bias, many great white musicians are either ignored or glossed over.  As a minority musician myself, I am by no means trying to champion white jazz, black jazz, or any other sort of silly and racist categorization.  What I do think, however, is that CRUCIALLY influential artists like Stan Getz and Bill Evans are glaring omissions from the series.  Getz (along with Charlie Byrd and a few others) was almost single-handedly responsible for bringing bossa nova into the jazz fold, and remains one of the most distinct saxophonists in jazz history.  Similarly, the only reference in the series to Bill Evans is a passing one to his historic participation on Miles' seminal album &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;.  Even there, Evans' contribution is reduced to an example of Miles' inclusion of a white pianist.  Completely lost is the European/Classical influence that Evans helped bring to jazz, along with his numerous other contributions.Even with these sorts of glaring omissions, Burns deserves much credit for the admirable scope and power of his documentary.  Rent it and watch it, but don't follow it as a definitive guide to jazz.  Please don't buy the ridiculous CD set that goes along with it.

I consult aspiring artists and companies on music business administration and entertainment consultant.  I (THOUGHT) I was a true student and devot&eacute;e of the history of black music.  Yet, after seeing this film, I realized that I knew less than 1% of the history of black music, but still more than a lot of people.  To say that Ken Burns is a master of filmmaking on historial subjects and events is a waste of words.  His films are always well-research and expertly presented.  I've seen ""The Civil War"", ""The War"", ""Thomas Jefferson"", ""The Brooklyn Bridge"", ""Huey Long"", ""The Shakers"", and even one on some obscure artist named Thomas Hart Benton.  But none of his films thus far has touched me like ""Jazz"".  Ken Burns presents to true story of this unique art - straight with no chaser.  He starts with the people who created jazz, like Charles ""Buddy"" Bolden, ""Jelly Roll"" Morton and Louis Armstrong.  Burns lets the world know that a self-important white boy named Nick LaRocca DID NOT create jazz as he went to his grave claiming (he was only the first jazz musician to be RECORDED), which is probably why know one remembers who he is!!For me, the single most relevant person in this film is co-commentator, Wynton Marsalis, who brings all of the historical facts together in a cohesive and easily understandable manner.  He's not only a genius musically but he had taken the time to learn the history of his craft.  It's a treat for him to pick up his trumpet to show us how Louis Armstrong or Charlie Parker or Benny Goodman or Ornette Coleman played, why each is different yet still retain the integrity of the genre.  He understands the heart of the music and the people who helped to create jazz, the only art form which is truly American.  As a great ""point-counterpoint"", the film also features his older brother, sax great Branford, who keeps it real, with his intelligent streetwise insight while Wynton is all dignity and grace (Wynton is the only person to receive the Pulitzer Prize for music - I DID NOT KNOW THAT UNTIL I SAW THIS FILM!!!).  After spending the last 20 years of my career in hip-hop music, I feel as if I've allowed myself to be ""dumbed down"" by contemporary ""music"", full of technicians rather than musicians, personalities instead of artists.  I know what a good musician is - I was married to a real acoustic drummer, not a drum machine or Pro Tools file.  I'd forgotten what made me choose the music business more than 4 decades ago - until I saw ""Jazz"".  Now I feel inadequate and small.  But at least I know why now.  And I don't feel the least bit bad about my inadequacies - because with legends like jazz creators Buddy Bolden, Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Dave Brubeck, Herbie Hancock, Bix Beiderbecke, Benny Goodman, Ella Fitzgerald, Chick Webb, Art Blakely, Gene Krupa, Tommy Dorsey, Sidney Bechet, Billy Holiday, Mary Lou Williams, Count Basie, and the greatest American composer in history, Edward Kennedy ""Duke"" Ellington,  I'm standing in mighty tall cotton!  I feel blessed to have lived in a time when these artists' music was still important.  And I'm so thankful for people like Pulitzer Prize winner Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Joe Luvano, Cassandra Wilson, Joshua Redman, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Dianne Reeves, James Carter, MC Solaar, Geri Allen, Marcus Roberts, Regina Carter, Christian, McBride, Louis Nash, David Murray, Steve Coleman, and the LaGuardia High School Jazz Band, the young new jazz musicians, who believe in themselves enough to show us what real music is all about and brave enough to carry the baton for all of the greats before us who made it possible for African-Americans to give their country a gift which cannot be denied.  Kudos to Ken Burns and his colleagues for making this film and telling the story with all of the flaws which are an integral part of genius.  This film should be required watching in elementary schools in the inner city so our children can see that their heritage is rich and beautiful, and so much more important than rims and bling - that they can stand on the shoulders of giants and never look down.",5,"BEYOND EXCELLENT!

We are referring to the fact that there were several white musicians who greatly influenced blacks, not just the other way around.  Miff Mole and Jack Teagarden, for instance, set the standard of trombone playing for about a decade until Dicky Wells came along (and, after him, J.J. Johnson).  Lester Young was influenced not by Armstrong and Benny Carter but by Bix and Frank Trumbauer.  Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald based their styles of singing on Connee Boswell, not Ethel Waters (who they both detested, by the way).  Benny Golson, who played with Art Blakey in the '50s and '60s, was most influenced by Glenn Miller saxist Tex Beneke.  Now, this isn't to say that this kind of thing was always the case, but BE FAIR!#2: There is a definite sexist bias throughout the 19 hours of &quot;Jazz.&quot;  Except for Mary Lou Williams, female jazz musicians are ignored completely.  Only the &quot;girl singers&quot; are praised.  And, when women are mentioned at all, it is in a way that demeans their intelligence and says that they were too dumb to appreciate the subtleties of the music (i.e., &quot;Women loved to have a copy of 'Miles Ahead' laying around because it was soft, sexy music&quot;...not because they understood what Miles Davis was doing).  And for that matter, where are the male jazz singers?  Where were King Pleasure, Dave Lambert, Jon Hendricks (except for when he was talking about Bird), Mel Torme, Leo Watson??#3: While it is true that &quot;not everyone could be included,&quot; there were just too many major innovators left out - really important ones without whom certain jumps and links just don't make sense.  Aside from my own personal prejudices, I think that most jazz fans and critics would have included Red Norvo, Nat King Cole, Woody Herman, George Russell, Lennie Tristano, Eric Dolphy and Ahmad Jamal (I would also have included Tiny Parham, Eddie Sauter, Boyd Raeburn, J.J. Johnson, Buddy DeFranco, Antonio Jobim and some actual sounds from Freddie Hubbard).  And, of course, we have little or nothing of post-1970 jazz, which is totally unfair (where were Arthur Blythe, the World Saxophone Quartet, Rabih Abou-Khalil or Tania Maria?).What worries me most is that all previous jazz histories will now become obsolete.  Only the Burns film and the Burns-Marsalis-Crouch agenda will be pushed.  Schoolchildren will grow up believing that Louis Armstrong's &quot;Hello Dolly&quot; was a more important and influential record than Dolphy's &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; or that Ellington's &quot;Afro-Eurasian Eclipse&quot; was a major work while Mingus's &quot;Black Saint and the Sinner Lady&quot; was insignificant.  Oh my, the list goes on and on.Valuable for some extremely rare photos and clips of performers (Bird talking on TV, Clifford Brown playing, etc.)  Worthless as a history of jazz.  Better to buy one of the many fine, compact jazz histories on the market.

557528,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,B00004XQOU,Michael J. Edelman,"[7, 12]","In his Civil War film, Ken Burns brought to life an era that most Americans in truth really know very little about, and he did so it a way that engaged a lot of viewers. In ""Baseball"", many have noted, he took a pastoral game and put people to sleep with it. For fans it was a wonderful collection of trivia and rare photos and interviews. For those who weren't fans it was tedious and boring.Much of this criticism also holds true for ""Jazz"". Forget the criticisms that it was spotty, or that it had way too much Wynton; ""Jazz"" has problems that go way beyond that. Marsalis may not be the best musicologist in the world, but he does know and love the music.The really big problem is this: I get a very strong impression that ""Jazz"" was written by people who weren't really jazz fans. They had a lot to say about the sociology of jazz, and the lives of the players, but almost nothing to say about the music that didn't sound like a quote of an album jacket. We were treated to endless, sometimes nonsensical statements about music and players from critics who didn't seem to be able to express anything meaningful about the music. And a lot of the discussions of the music were woefully inept.Listening to the show a naiive listener might get the impression that Jazz is nothing but the blues played at swing tempo. Now the blues is central to jazz, but so is 19th century European classical music. Jazz gets its flatted 5ths from the blues, but those m7b5 and dim7#11 chords didn't come from a field holler. The great genius of the Jazz musicians is how they took all these different traditions and created something more than just an amalgam of styles. Some of the greatest early jazz tunes were built on military marches.Even country music has its influence on jazz- look at Ray Charles. Here's a man who incorporated gospel, blues, and country into his style. But the producers of ""Jazz"" missed that.A lot of the criticism has focused on what figures were selected to present. Sure, you can't feature every important artist, but with all the time spent on some musicians, the omission of other figures was almost comical.A music educator friend of mine said, after the first three episodes, ""Where the hell is W.C. Handy?""  Handy was the composer of St. Louis Blues, the first great Black American music publisher and by any measure a major figure. He was celebrated not just in this country, but all across Europe. Yet they spent more time on Ossie Davis's recollections of a movie he appeared in with Louis Armstrong than they did on W.C. Handy.Even despite all these criticisms I enjoyed much of the show. I saw film clips I'd never seen before, like Diz leading his big band, or Duke at Newport. Some of the  interviews with musicians done for the film were excellent.

After having watched the whole thing, I now realize that is an expectation that perhaps can never be met. Ken Burns does a pretty good job at it, though, in all fairness.Never dull, this set is a sophisticated and engaging exploration of the evolution of Jazz from its roots to the present. It's perhaps a bit too obvious whom Burns lists among his personal favorites. Louis Armstrong is certainly a genius, perhaps even the pre-eminent genius of the genre, but I believe the completism of the series is compromised by an overabundance of coverage of him specifically (along with a few other greats like Duke Ellington).However, there is certainly never a dull moment, and perhaps for a mainstream document like this, the emphasis on the mainstream artists is justifiable.

557533,A19SPM4Y7A8OHN,B00004XQOU,MrQ,"[1, 2]","After several years of postponement I finally viewed this series in its entirety over a 4-day period (Fall 2011).Note: I began this series with prejudice. First, I had already heard, since its release, about Burns having missed the mark with the Jazz in the 60's and beyond, how he failed to mention a lot of great artists. Secondly, having watched my share of his documentaries, I was prepared to again hear his insistence that I, as a viewer, MUST NOT FORGET for even fifteen minutes, what America did to Black folks. Blah-Blah-Blah. Enough already---I wasn't around then.The series started out very slow with me. Louis Armstrong is God. OK, I get that. But Mr. Burns, do you have to keep it going for nearly every episode? And really, does it matter what this god thinks about the state of Jazz when he is at the end of his life?!Well. Having reached the end of the series and giving it much thought, I must say YES, it was the right thing to do having Louis Armstrong (and Duke Ellington) featured in every episode. As Dizzy Gillespie himself said of him---""No him, no me"", all musicians, including myself, are inspired by someone else; and many times that journey includes tracing the steps of those who pioneered your chosen genre.The error, as some say, of spending such little time on Jazz' progression since the 1970's and failing to mention other great musicians, could have been corrected by adding more episodes. Doing that would have made this series a knock out grand slam! On the other hand, with budgets and audiences being what they are, such a thing was probably not even an option.Nevertheless, Louis Armstrong and The Duke certainly deserve all the time they were given. Who can argue that they were as prolific and influential as any in the history of music?The series has many amazing clips, interviews, and sidebars about the lives of these musicians. The obsession that these musicians had with their music is beyond comprehension, yet it explains their greatness. It is inspirational too---I would encourage anyone to engage young people to view this. It shows what dedication can do to bring one's gifts out of them and change their lives. Conversely it shows what happens if you take a wrong path in your life, as indicated by those hooked on heroin; and/or fail to take care of yourself.I especially enjoyed the occasional shot of an album cover, say Miles Davis', Kind of Blue, or Coltrane's, A Love Supreme, along with a mention of how it was a groundbreaker. It is quite a pleasure to tell your spouse at that time, ""I got that album!"", and ""I got that one too!""I least liked the interviews with writers (the press). Hearing these people wax on, attempting to intellectualize music, is a pet peeve. Especially irritating are their attempts to tell me how me how so-and-so must have felt during such-and-such event. ""You weren't there guy so shut your pie hole"", is my usual response. Wynton Marsalis did his fair share of this throughout also. Him I can overlook though because he is a great musician and Jazz historian.Regarding the race issue, I walked away from ""Jazz"" with the notion (which I already suspected all my life) that the arts, Jazz especially, were the REAL FORERUNNERS of ending the absolute hideous BS of trying to segregate the races in this nation. Ken Burns picked no two better ambassadors of this than the interviews with Frankie Manning and Norma Miller. The joy that these two felt at the Savoy was still so intense that it bubbled out of them and found its way on the film. And as they both said, and as the pictures prove, race was not an issue at the Savoy. The issue was, ""Can you dance?!"" Watching these segments made my yearn for being alive then and taking it all in.Then, all the BS about having ""white"" jazz clubs and ""black"" jazz clubs--Lord, what a tragic state of affairs this was. Imagine the music that could have been(?), but because of segregation, we will never know. Another relatable segment was Duke Ellington's band being turned away from hotels because they were black. Given the economic problems we have today, what would someone say to a Hotel owner who turned away selling a dozen rooms just because they were black?, a black band?, a black JAZZ band?!, Duke Ellington?!!! You would think they were insane, and of course, they would be! How did this insanity survive so long?IMO there is too much time wasted on ""race"" in the United States today, however ""Jazz"" was THE PERFECT place to discuss it and drive it home. I find myself wondering, would Jazz even exist today were it not for the circumstances under which it was born? Anyway, these are type of questions that ""Jazz"" provoked in me---Kudos to Ken Burns for using music to make me ask these questions of myself.Ken Burns has to be given credit for taking on this long-overdue project. Would it have been done otherwise?...and on this scale? I tend to say No.All in all, I found this to be a fine series and encourage anyone to watch it.",4,"Satchmo & Duke, Canonized",1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,4977,"['several', 'years', 'postponement',

This said, I can very well understand why some disagree with the deemphasis on avant-garde and the huge emphasis on Louis Armstrong and swing era... (actually, I completely agree with Burns' and Marsalis' deemphasis on fusion).There are some magnificent images and sounds, performances and testimonies here, all well directed and organized, often capturing the best /or too rarely seen/ performances by Armstrong, Goodman, Basie, Rushing, Davis, Parker and others. Actually, there's too much on swing clarinetist for my tastes - although I like both Goodman and Shaw...This means that this is almost ideal historical introduction to jazz (although there are some mistakes - for instance, the narration lives the impression that Freddie Green came with Basie from Kansas City are, which is false).Since I am mostly interested into ""classical"" and ""early modern"" jazz, this would draw 5 stars from me but... well... how should one put it? There's too much Marsalis in it!Don't get me wrong - I'm a big admirer of Wynton's work but, since he was a senior consultant to Ken Burns, he should have restrained himself a bit (and even his brother Branford has a prominent role in some episodes)... In the end of the last episode Wynton is presented as a some sort of succesor to the elder giants of jazz /which is probably not wrong/, without giving enough tribute to Art Blakey and the trumpeters that preceded Wynton in The Jazz Messengers...It would be prudent to restrain himself a bit, although he is an articulate and persuasive advocate of jazz (as he generally is)... But, since this was produced in 2000 it is a great pity the surviving participants of jazz development were underutilized (Doc Cheatham, Lionel Hampton, Clark Terry...) or not interviewed at all (Hank Jones, Frank Wess, Snooky Young, Ron Carter, Ray Brown, Freddie Hubbard...).Since Artie Shaw, for instance, was so well presented, it creates a disbalance.

557538,ALXZ64A9OAPJ8,B00004XQOU,"Phrodoe ""Child Of The Kindly Midwest""","[15, 19]","Let me ask you a question: Would it have been any better if this documentary was two hours long instead of nearly twenty, and if Wynton Marsalis hadn't been involved? These seem to be the two major objections the reviewers I've read have to Ken Burns' epic series about one of the greatest forms of American music. Burns admits to knowing little about jazz when he began this documentary...but since he didn't write it, it hardly seems fair to fault him for the shortcomings of the script. As it is, I think both Burns and his writer did a pretty good job. Yes, only the major players in jazz are covered -- so what? If Burns had taken time to profile every great or semi-great jazz artist who ever played in a nightclub or a recording session, we'd be talking about a fifty-hour movie! Let's get real here, folks. As to the complaints about Marsalis...I quite frankly don't understand them. His love of the music is obvious and his enthusiasm seems genuine to me; the major problem most of the reviewers on this page seem to have with Wynton Marsalis is that he's Wynton Marsalis. Why? The man obviously knows his stuff; he's a brilliant musician in his own right, and has championed jazz at times when jazz has seemed to have few champions. To say there is no soul in what he's saying, or that he lacks knowledge (I loved the implication that Stanley Crouch was coaching him from off-camera), seems entirely unfair, even a touch cruel. He may be a bit of an exclusionary purist at times (see, now you've got me doing it!), but at least he respects the form.As regards the talking heads (of which there may indeed be a few too many) talking over classic songs of the genre, I too wish there had been a little less of that. &quot;Sing Sing Sing&quot; is one of my all-time favorite swing tunes, and I would have loved to have heard it in its entirety here. Still and all, this is a documentary, and overdoses of commentary are to be expected if not embraced. I can live with it as long as it doesn't get too annoying...and some of the commentary here, such as the first-hand accounts of great artists like Artie Shaw, Lionel Hampton, and Dave Brubeck, and writers like Nat Hentoff, Studs Terkel, and Stanley Crouch, are priceless.Overall, this series is not perfection -- but hell, what is in this world? Maybe if Hentoff had written it, there would be more about some of the lesser-known but equally respect-worthy jazzmen, and maybe more attention would have been paid to the post-1961-to-present time period, which is admittedly lacking in Burns' film (indeed, it's the weakest point of Jazz, much as the final episode of Baseball was in its attempt to cram almost 40 years of history into two hours). Maybe if Burns had known more about his subject, I would be giving Jazz five stars instead of just four. Who knows? More to the point, who cares? In my mind, it's a wonder a film like this, with all its admitted flaws, was made at all. If nothing else, it can serve as a primer (and a darned good one) for those who don'e know much about this amazing body of music -- and perhaps it can win even more people over to loving jazz. I know for my part it's made me pull out all my old John Coltrane, Miles, Monk, et al, and give them several good listens...and if Jazz can accomplish that, then I think it's probably done its job pretty well.",4,Not Perfect -- But What Is?,980726400,"01 29, 2001",2001,3343,"['Let', 'ask', 'question', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'documentary', 'was', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'instead', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'involved', 'seem', 'be', 'two', 'major', 'objections', 'reviewers', ""'ve"", 'read', 'have', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'epic', 'series', 'one', 'greatest', 'forms', 'American', 'music', 'Burns', 'knowing', 'little', 'jazz', 'when', 'began', 'documentary', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'hardly', 'fair', 'fault', 'shortcomings', 'script', 'think', 'Burns', 'writer', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Yes', 'only', 'major', 'players', 'jazz', 'are', 'covered', 'what', 'Burns', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'profile', 'great', 'semi-great', 'jazz', 'artist', 'who', 'ever', 'played', 'nightclub', 'recording', 'session', ""'d"", 'be', 'talking', 'fifty-hour', 'movie', 'Let', 'get', 'real', 'here', 'folks', 'complaints', 'Marsalis', 'quite', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'love', 'music', 'obvious', 'enthusiasm', 'genuine', 'major', 'problem', 'most', 'reviewers', 'page', 'seem', 'have', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'Why', 'man', 'obviously', 'stuff', 'brilliant', 'musician', 'own', 'right', 'championed', 'jazz', 'times', 'when', 'jazz', 'seemed', 'have', 'few', 'champions', 'say', 'soul', 'what', 'saying', 'knowledge', 'loved', 'implication', 'Stanley', 'Crouch', 'was', 'coaching', 'off-camera', 'entirely', 'unfair', 'even', 'touch', 'cruel', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'exclusionary', 'purist', 'times', 'see', 'now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'doing', 'least', 'form.As', 'talking', 'heads', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'talking', 'classic', 'songs', 'genre', 'too', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'less', 'quot', 'Sing', 'Sing', 'Sing', 'quot', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'swing', 'tunes', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'heard', 'entirety', 'here', 'Still', 'documentary', 'overdoses', 'commentary', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'not', 'embraced', 'can', 'live', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'annoying', 'commentary', 'here', 'such', 'first-hand', 'accounts', 'great', 'artists', 'Artie', 'Shaw', 'Lionel', 'Hampton', 'Dave', 'Brubeck', 'writers', 'Nat', 'Hentoff', 'Studs', 'Terkel', 'Stanley', 'Crouch', 'are', 'priceless.Overall', 'series', 'not', 'perfection', 'hell', 'what', 'world', 'Maybe', 'Hentoff', 'had', 'written', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'lesser-known', 'equally', 'respect-worthy', 'jazzmen', 'maybe', 'more', 'attention', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'paid', 'post-1961-to-present', 'time', 'period', 'admittedly', 'lacking', 'Burns', 'film', 'indeed', 'weakest', 'point', 'Jazz', 'much', 'final', 'episode', 'Baseball', 'was', 'attempt', 'cram', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'history', 'two', 'hours', 'Maybe', 'Burns', 'had', 'known', 'more', 'subject', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'Jazz', 'five', 'stars', 'instead', 'just', 'four', 'Who', 'More', 'point', 'who', 'mind', 'wonder', 'film', 'admitted', 'flaws', 'was', 'made', 'nothing', 'else', 'can', 'serve', 'primer', 'darned', 'good', 'one', 'who', 'don', 'e', 'know', 'much', 'amazing', 'body', 'music', 'perhaps', 'can', 'win', 'even', 'more', 'people', 'loving', 'jazz', 'know', 'part', 'made', 'pull', 'out', 'old', 'John', 'Coltrane', 'Miles', 'Monk', 'et', 'al', 'give', 'several', 'good', 'listens', 'Jazz', 'can', 'accomplish', 'then', 'think', 'probably', 'done', 'job', 'pretty', 'well']",N/A

Granted, the film offers only a glimpse of the x's and o's of the genre, but for me it speaks more to the freedom of Jazz as an art form. You cannot separate the music from the people who created it, or the country in which it was created. Jazz is American music; the only original American music - free, uninhibited and at times as flawed as the country of its birth. The broad brush strokes of the series may sometimes gloss over details but that's OK with me. The message is the music and the music is the people. The film also speaks to the generations of creative genius that were plowed under by the excesses of drugs, violence and tobacco. As I watched the film, I felt uncomfortable with the murky answers to the question, ""What if..?"" What if Coltrane and Parker had lived longer? What future fertile landscape could have been harvested had Ellington and Strayhorn not fell victim to cancer?My son is a graphic artist, but I thought it was important that he view this series because it tells the story of the black artist contributing, in many cases, to his own demise.

Martinez ""Doctor of Rock""","[10, 23]","I find it incredible that there are a few negative reviews because Ken Burns left out the ""free-jazz"" era or the fusion-jazz-rock era.  Well, he just kinda glossed over it.  It is far more interesting to see the early history and development of jazz including the likes of Buddy Bolden, who dates back to 1895, Freddie Keppard and  through the early New Orleans' Storyville and the riverboats.  The sections on the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1917),  King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbeck, The Swing Era and the observations from Wynton Marsalis are especially interesting.  Regarding the dismissal of modern players like Rashad Roland Kirk, Ornette Coleman etc.  I hate to say this, but that music is virtually unlistenable.  Even a lot of Coltrane's later stuff is ""sax squawking"" to many ears. The fusion ""let's be like Sly Stone"" jazz- wah-wah sound of say like Bitches Brew and all rock fusion from the 70's, sounds today hopelessly dated and boring. When I was in high school I listened to Brubeck, Miles, MJQ, Monk and Oscar Peterson and most of my allies thought it to be weird music.  Can you imagine how anyone in their right mind could listen to Roland Kirk and really enjoy it? Don't forget, you can't beat a good song, but you can ruin it.  Burns got it right.  He focused on the historical development dating as far back to 1820 in Congo Square in New Orleans and early blues as well.  After 1970, most jazz became product to please the young rock audience, who really didn't understand jazz anyway.  I'm glad that a lot of jazz today has returned to its acoustic roots.  Wynton Marsalis, actually was at the vanguard of reviving the acoustic sound of jazz during the late 80's and early 90's, so he is the best spokesmen who appreciates what true jazz history is really all about.

557545,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00004XQOU,Robert Moore,"[11, 15]","Ken Burns is a man who loves to tell a good story, and his stories always have heroes, tragedies, and reveal something about the heart of the American experience. Just as in his other epic made-for-TV epics THE CIVIL WAR and BASEBALL, as well as a host of shorter projects, JAZZ is a narrative that tells vividly the viewer something crucial about this nation. My conception of patriotism has little to do with the uncritical, jingoistic, flag-waving fanaticism that delusionally imagines that God somehow favors the United States above all other nations (an attitude that drove John Adams stark raving angry). My idea of a patriot is someone who can look at their country truly and accurate, not ignore the shameful episodes, not falsely embellish our virtues, and yet truly see the wonderful things we contribute. Burns is, for me, the consummate patriot. In all of his work he obviously grieves over the shameful racial legacy of our nation, but he exults over what has been achieved despite this.This is a history of Jazz in America, with a qualification. ""Jazz"" for Burns means acoustic jazz, as opposed to jazz produced with electric, as opposed to merely amplified, instruments. If one is a fan of fusion or even electric guitar, one is going to find virtually nothing in this series. In fact, the ten two-hour episodes dispense with electric jazz in less than five minutes, and then as what is seen as a lamentable downturn in Miles Davis's career.JAZZ chronicles the history of jazz from its birth in New Orleans roughly a century ago through its earliest stages to it maturation in Chicago and New York in the twenties and thirties to its influence on the birth of swing through the various Kansas City influences (whether Count Basie's own brand of swing to Charlie Parker) to its eventual breakdown into a host of schools of jazz. The heroes are the obvious ones. Above all, the series follows the story of Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, who emerge as the twin magisterial figures of jazz: Armstrong the supreme instrumentalist and vocalist, whose influenced the performing style of everyone who followed, and Ellington who is portrayed not merely as the great jazz composer but also the great American composer (a contention that others besides Burns makes). Nearly as important are a host of other iconic individuals such as the immortal Billie Holliday, innovators like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillepsie, the irrepressible Chick Webb, the tragic Bix Beiderbecke, pioneers like Sidney Bechet and Coleman Hawkins, and the marvelous Lester Young. Literally dozens of major and minor jazz figures have their stories told through a wonderful combination of still photography, recordings, readings by actors, and film footage.The best thing about JAZZ is that it can serve either as a visual treat to established fans of jazz, or as a primer and introduction to those who know nothing about it. Though everyone will in the end have wished that there might have been a bit less on this or that figure, or a bit more on this one or that (surely they could have found a few more minutes for Sarah Vaughan? Or many more minutes for John Coltrane?), no one can say that Burns and his team didn't try.One of the strengths of Burns's series is his great group of commentators. The single thing that made THE CIVIL WAR so exciting was Shelby Foote's extraordinary contributions. JAZZ also benefits by some great verbal assistance by a first rate group of people. Gary Giddens enlightens nearly everyone he reflects on, as does Nat Hentoff and Stanley Crouch. But the best comments by far, especially in the early years, are those by Wynton Marsalis. He invigorates the series partly through his enormous love of the music, partly by his extensive knowledge of its history, partly through his wonderfully engaging personality and the wise things he has to say, and partly through his ability to illustrate his comments by playing his trumpet. There are also a few interviews with some major jazz figures, though tragically there were far fewer great surviving figures for the filming of this series than when Burns did his baseball series. The only figure from the thirties was Artie Shaw, but as always he provides such intelligent testimony that his contribution was especially desirable. Dave Brubeck contributed, as did Herbie Hancock, but few of their ilk were able to contribute.It really doesn't matter if you like jazz or not.

This is not a &quot;history&quot; of jazz--it's a &quot;story&quot; of jazz, as effectively communicated as any that has hitherto been constructed.  Moreover, it has managed to engage not only the PBS audience that normally watches Louis Rukeyser and Lawrence Welk re-runs (with John Tesh brought on for fund-raising).  A diverse audience with little knowledge of jazz, of jazz and race, of the importance of Louis, Duke, and Bird has suddenly started to question, talk, purchase--and, above all, to listen.  Ken Burns is a myth-maker in the best sense of the word, making masses aware of a tradition, a legacy, an art form that frankly did not previously exist in the consciousness of most  Americans.  Thank goodness he didn't present a &quot;catalogue,&quot; stage a &quot;jam session&quot; with hundreds of musicians, or drydock the journey with all sorts of sociological-revisionist history-musicological scholarship and jargon.  The series is simply indispensable, a starting point for any further conversations about the subject.  Burns is no less a storyteller than the great John Ford.  If like Ford he gets some of the &quot;facts&quot; wrong, the power of the narrative and the &quot;truth&quot; of its central meaning remains unassailable. Thank you, Ken Burns!

I enjoyed the history of jazz beginnings and the photos and film clips throughout were top notch.  I listen to a lot of jazz, and have read a fair bit about it, but I can't really authoritatively critique the finer points of where the facts may be wrong, as some other reviewers are able to.  My favorite period is the Be-Bop era, and Jazz devotes a good amount of time to that era, as well as the future offshoots.  For the most part, I liked the commentary, although over the course of 19 hours, I thought that I saw too much of some people.  Which leads to...in my opinion the amount of time devoted to Louis Armstrong was excessive.  OK, I am a heretic, whatever, and I realize Louis' genius, place in jazz, his charisma, his talent and longevity.  That being said, every episode has a segment devoted to him.  I understand the early years, but the last couple episodes actually had me thinking, ""not more Louis"".  In the episodes on the fifties and sixties, while it does spend time on Miles and Coltrane, there are so many others to spend time on.  There was too much time on the ""Hello Dolly"" single.  I am not a big fan of fusion, but in the last episode, the film goes from Miles electric period right into, more Armstrong.  Then a clip of him singing, to a concert clip of him doing the same song.  Then an extended segment on his funeral.  Then near the end of the show was a concert clip of ""Dinah"", which is a repeat of an earlier episode.  I guess with the input from the commentators, it isn't a surprise, but it was a times not ""Jazz"", but ""Armstrong and the rest.""  My apologies, but I thought is was too much.

Fascinating, accessible, filled with great music and film clips.  I enjoyed the series immensely, and am forever in Mr. Burns' debt for introducing me to the joys of Thelonious Monk and Art Tatum, and for giving me a higher appreciation of jazz and the artists who create it.  I'm sure there's a great deal more to be said than Ken Burns was able to say in this one documentary series, but what is said here is said with an admirable clarity and infectious enthusiasm.  A very fine film, well worth watching.The DVD is well produced, and the transfer is excellent.  There's a splendid special feature that allows you to see the name of whatever piece of music that happens to be playing at any given time.There are a couple of quibbles, to be sure.  The series often seems in danger of becoming the Wynton Marsalis Show, as Mr. Marsalis appears in virtually every episode and gets what can feel like more than his share of screen time.  Further, Mr. Burns has an irritating habit of bringing his films to a halt so that one of his experts can wax rhapsodic on Jazz as The Highest Single Accomplishment In The History Of Human Endeavor, The Most Significant And Sustaining Art Form Ever Created, Truly The Work Of The Angels and so on and so forth.As a whole, though, this is a fascinating and enlightening series.

Ken Burns essentially gave them the reins to write the content for this documentary since Burns knew (and knows) nothing about jazz.Rather than repeat those points I concur with, I will simply add that this is a bad documentary that doesn't tell the history of jazz. It tells the history of what was going on in the country while jazz was being created. It more or less sticks to the pre-swing and swing eras, and really doesn't delve into the music. It delves into personalities and trivial anecdotes. Do we really learn what made Ellington a great pianist and a great composer? No. We just hear that ""Duke became one of the greatest composers of the 20th century."" Why? What exactly made him so great? What are some of his specific compositions that are so great and why? What was new about them? Burns doesn't know. He doesn't say. We hear instead about how the title ""Take the A-Train"" came about. Not about the music though.Also annoying is the endless repetition. We keep hearing the same anecdotes about the same musicians over and over and over (""so and so would come into the club and the whole joint would just start jumpin'!!""). We must see the same photographs of Louis Armstrong a dozen times. Burns is not just ignorant about jazz, he's a lazy documentary filmmaker.In the end, this documentary is entertainment for the masses, not for serious listeners, students, or historians of music. It's for history buffs who want to know about F. Scott Fitzgerald's America and the era of The Great Gatsby. If you want to learn about jazz, you'll be wasting your time.

I thought his documentary on the Civil War was just wonderful,  and as a jazz  lover  I looked  forward to seeing what  he would  do with  jazz.  It was a mixed blessing.The series starts out well. Getting into the roots and history of where jazz started and the early pioneers, like Buddy Bolden.  Yet as Ken Burns moves on he seems to get stalled in the swing ear. Now I agree that it was important because of the likes of Duke Ellington and Count Basie, but come one three or four episodes on the swing era. It was a little much. The other place where this documentary lacks is on some artists. Ken burns is fair with some and goes on and on about others. I agree that Louis Armstrong helped make and shape jazz, but  there were many others who should have received more credit. These include Miles Davis, Chet Baker, Dave Brubeck, and many others. Ken Burns's sort of speeds through the 50's and 60's. He points out great groups and albums, but does not give much credit to some of the amazing sidemen who helped shape jazz during the 50's and 60's. One of these people is bassist Paul Chambers.  This is partially do to the fact that as I have said before she spends to much time in the swing era.If there is one place that I cannot forgive Ken Burns is just totally skipping the 70's and the Jazz / Fusion era. To just skip over this is saying that groups like Weather Report  were unimportant ,  or the work of Joni Mitchell's Mingus,  Don Juan's Reckless Daughter were nothing. He also skimps out on people like Jaco Pastorius,  Chick Corea,  Wayne  Shorter, and Joe Zawinul.  To Ken Burns that that happened in the 70's was Dextor Gorden's coming home concert. Now as important as this is it was not the only thing.  The same is to be said of the 80's and 90's. Ken Burns not talking about people like Pat Metheny,  John McLaughlin,  Bela Fleck and the Flecktones to name just a few.Yet for all the of that, it was still enjoyable. I learned a lot of new information that I had never know before. The cinematography was fantastic. Hearing stories from musicians was great to hear tell what happen in their own way. It made the whole thing more personal.  The adding of history also played well. And how world and US history helped shaped the sound and style of jazz in the early years was great.  It is important piece of work I would show this to any teacher teaching music history or jazz.  This is simply great  to watch if you are not a die hard jazz lover, like myself.

It's not anything near an objective, comprehensive or even ""fair"" history of jazz, but -- it's jazz -- and that's all the title says it is.Consider, too, that the personalities Burns chose, the biographies and sociology of the times he chose to focus in on, all these things must have been very, very hard to resist.  While there are many great jazz performers post-1961, do they and the times they lived in compare to the drama and poignancy of what jazz was prior to 1960?  Are the personalities as magnetic or as relevant, not just from a musical point of view but from an historical/sociological point of view?Also, let's not expect too much from Ken Burns in terms of insightful, courageous filmmaking.  Far from it.  He's PBS' boy: he's their piano player, he just works there -- for PBS and its many corporatist sponsors.  So to the degree jazz is radical, subversive and a danger to the status quo, well, Ken Burns or PBS'll have no part of it.  They play it safe.  Why?  Because as Willie Sutton would put it: ""That's where the money is.""PBS knows exactly what they're going to get when they sign Burns on.  And if you think that ""Burns' America"" is going to be anything but mythology, then you haven't been paying attention to what PBS has become.PBS' charter, way back when it started in the late 1960s, specifically stated that it would offer programming not available on commercial television.  Now, given that pledge they made back in the 70s, look at how pathetic PBS has become. ... Cary Grant movies. ... Music programs of washed-up rock and roll singers who couldn't get on commercial teeveee nowadays with a car full of gangsters and three brigades of agents ... Biographies of Mario Lanza, Bobby Darin and, get this, 70s talk show host Mike Douglas! (Talk about scraping the bottom of the barrel).So Ken Burns knew just what he was doing.  How wonderful it is for all these ""cruise missile liberals"" (not a radical bone in their body) talking about race way, WAY after it took any kind of real courage to talk about it.  Oh, how they flock to tell us about *past* racial injustices; and how assiduously they ignore current political maladies.No, Ken Burns in their boy, that's for sure.  So, for sure, ""Jazz"" is highly entertaining, but do I expect Burns, in league with PBS, to do anything more than entertain?  Of course not.  Burns is a safe liberal and knowing how PBS has caved every time anyone has offered anything to the left of ""safe liberalism,"" what he produces here is simply par for his course: entertaining, arbitrary, ingratiating and sacharrine.",3,What Do You Expect From Kenny-Boy?,1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,2889,"['people', 'who', 'panned', 'series', 'gave', 'only', '1', '2', 'stars', 'are', 'absolutley', 'correct', 'Burns', 'limited', 'biased', 'view', 'jazz', 'virtually', 'ignoring', 'everything', 'came', '1961.But', 'acknowledging', 'truth', 'grave', 'shortcoming', 'series', 'still', 'what', 'well-done', 'entertaining', 'not', 'anything', 'objective', 'comprehensive', 'even', 'fair', 'history', 'jazz', 'jazz', 'title', 'is.Consider', 'too', 'personalities', 'Burns', 'chose', 'biographies', 'sociology', 'times', 'chose', 'focus', 'things', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'resist', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'jazz', 'performers', 'post-1961', 'do', 'times', 'lived', 'compare', 'drama', 'poignancy', 'what', 'jazz', 'was', 'prior', '1960', 'Are', 'personalities', 'magnetic', 'relevant', 'not', 'just', 'musical', 'point', 'view', 'historical/sociological', 'point', 'view', 'Also', 'let', 'not', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'terms', 'insightful', 'courageous', 'filmmaking', 'Far', 'PBS', 'boy', 'piano', 'player', 'just', 'there', 'PBS', 'many', 'corporatist', 'sponsors', 'So', 'degree', 'jazz', 'radical', 'subversive', 'danger', 'status', 'quo', 'well', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'PBS', ""'ll"", 'have', 'part', 'play', 'safe', 'Why', 'Willie', 'Sutton', 'would', 'put', 'where', 'money', 'PBS', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'when', 'sign', 'Burns', 'think', 'Burns', 'America', 'going', 'be', 'anything', 'mythology', 'then', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'paying', 'attention', 'what', 'PBS', 'become.PBS', 'charter', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'started', 'late', '1960s', 'specifically', 'stated', 'would', 'offer', 'programming', 'not', 'available', 'commercial', 'television', 'Now', 'given', 'pledge', 'made', 'back', '70s', 'look', 'how', 'pathetic', 'PBS', 'become', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'movies', 'Music', 'programs', 'washed-up', 'rock', 'roll', 'singers', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'commercial', 'teeveee', 'nowadays', 'car', 'full', 'gangsters', 'three', 'brigades', 'agents', 'Biographies', 'Mario', 'Lanza', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'get', '70s', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'Mike', 'Douglas', 'Talk', 'scraping', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'knew', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'How', 'wonderful', 'cruise', 'missile', 'liberals', 'not', 'radical', 'bone', 'body', 'talking', 'race', 'way', 'WAY', 'took', 'kind', 'real', 'courage', 'talk', 'Oh', 'how', 'flock', 'tell', '*past*', 'racial', 'injustices', 'how', 'assiduously', 'ignore', 'current', 'political', 'maladies.No', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'boy', 'sure', 'So', 'sure', 'Jazz', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'do', 'expect', 'Burns', 'league', 'PBS', 'do', 'anything', 'more', 'entertain', 'course', 'not', 'Burns', 'safe', 'liberal', 'knowing', 'how', 'PBS', 'caved', 'time', 'anyone', 'offered', 'anything', 'left', 'safe', 'liberalism', 'what', 'here', 'simply', 'par', 'course', 'entertaining', 'arbitrary', 'ingratiating', 'sacharrine']",N/A

I was first subjected to the torture of this documentary on a bus tour.  You'd think anything different on a thousand mile bus trip would be welcome, but you'd be thinking wrong.  We were forced to take control of the VCR, and watch &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot; to keep our brains from rotting (yeah, I know this is a DVD review, but I'm just reviewing the content).I'm not going to get into the specifics of everything since I believe other reviewers have covered most of the bases.  I would just like to make the observation that it is a testament to the extreme dullness of these videos that a guy who can listen to jazz for hours on end (like myself) can be so bored by a jazz documentary that he has to turn it off.That's just a little something to think about before you spend alot of money.

557569,A1DSOF0EK9G06C,B00004XQOU,Zarathustra,"[0, 0]","Jazz begins in New Orleans. Since Wynton Marsalis is from New Orleans, we learn a lot about the origins of jazz from him. Then the rest of the film shifts to the dance clubs in Chicago, New York and Kansas City. This was the swing era in the thirties and forties. We see lots of old film clips about the swing era on DVDs 1-17. A newcomer to jazz would think that jazz is dead. On DVDs 18-20 we get a few clips of progressive jazz and lots of talk about it. We are introduced to Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck and Cassandra Wilson, who are great, but we hear very little music from them.Jazz is still alive, but it appears in different forms.  Latin jazz is important in the Caribbean: Eddie Palmieri is from Puerto Rico, and Afro Cuban jazz has a long history. Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto are well known in Brazil. Why no latin jazz? In France there is a fusion of jazz and classical in Darius Milhaud's La Creation du monde, Le Boeuf sur la toit and Saudades do Brazil. Also in France is the Jacques Lousier Trio, which has recorded Bach's Goldberg Variations for a jazz trio.Finally, in the US we find a lot of DVDs, CDs and MP3s recorded by new artists. I like Hilary Kole, Madeleine Peyroux, Melody Gardot and Sophie Milman, who sings in Russian on her DVD Live in Montreal.Let's face it, the swing era was great, but it's dead, as is Louie Armstrong. Enough already.Finally, do a blu-ray version of Jazz.

557570,ACDZDAW1ZJ304,B00004XQOU,"""zimri-lim""","[48, 83]","I caught most of this series when it was broadcast on TV here in the UK.  I have to say that as a jazz afficianado I find this a deeply ill-informed and misleading production which is blinkered to many of the key messages in jazz. Ken Burns clearly has a very narrow view of what jazz is.  While everybody is entitled to have their own perspective on what is, after all, a very wide genre of music the documentary maker with such a broad canvas should not be fogiven for producing such a misleading and downright wrong view of their subject. Here are some of Mr Burns cardinal sins:1.  This series moves up until the start of the 1960's just when jazz was due to enter it's most creative period.  This is a little like giving a history of classical music and stopping at the end of the Baroque era thereby leaving out Mozart, Beethoven et al.  This is totally ignorant and misleading and suggests that jazz ""stopped"" in 1961 when in fact it was just getting started...2.  The series is deeply racist in that it portrays jazz almost as an exclusively black experience. This seems to be the central thesis.  While many of it's greatest early exponents were black there is little appreciation of the basis for jazz in the folk and popular idioms of the US and Europe, created by generations of white musicians.  An analysis of the greatest jazz musicians of our current era reveals it to be an open arena for Blacks, Whites and Hispanics - all important contributors.  Maybe this is the reason for Burns' stopping at the 1960's as his central theme of jazz being the exclusive arena of black people looks even shakier after this period.  I find this racist view simplistic, patronising, offensive and deeply ignorant.  Here is a production with a major axe to grind - beware!3.  Why all the reliance on Wynton Marsalis?  Do people who like jazz actually listen to this guy?  I certainly don't even though I recognise him as a fine trumpeter.  How he has managed to set himself up as Mr Jazz is really rather bizarre as he has very little in common with any of the great jazz musicians, past or present. He is a preserver of jazz, not a creator; a curator in the art gallery of jazz, not the Picasso or the Pollock.  Why weren't more significant jazz musicians consulted?4.  Jazz before the 1960's was great music at the time and in many ways was creative but as it has since grown in subtlety and complexity as well as all-round creativity, pre-1960's jazz now looks pretty pale by comparison with more recent jazz.  While there are those who do still listen to Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie and other luminaries from jazz's formative years the majority of jazz followers are looking at newer musicians and styles.  That is the essence of jazz; it's creative, always trying to move forward, find new ways of expressing, looking for a new vocabulary.  Let's hear more about what jazz IS not what it WAS.All in all, then a major two thumbs down from me, a deeply ignorant and offensive production by someone who clearly has poor taste and a rather questionable agenda.  If you are interested in finding out about the great musical genre called jazz and what it really is don't go down this route.  Here's a better suggestion: go to some of the Amazon recommended lists and do your own research.  Two things are sure - you'll save yourself $... and you'll end up with far more interesting and relevant music.",1,Distorted View of Jazz Creates a Flawed & Offensive View,1001808000,"09 30, 2001",2001,3421,"['caught', 'most', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'here', 'UK', 'have', 'say', 'jazz', 'afficianado', 'find', 'deeply', 'ill-informed', 'misleading', 'production', 'blinkered', 'many', 'key', 'messages', 'jazz', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'clearly', 'very', 'narrow', 'view', 'what', 'jazz', 'everybody', 'entitled', 'have', 'own', 'perspective', 'what', 'very', 'wide', 'genre', 'music', 'documentary', 'maker', 'broad', 'canvas', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'fogiven', 'producing', 'misleading', 'downright', 'wrong', 'view', 'subject', 'Here', 'are', 'Mr', 'Burns', 'cardinal', 'sins:1', 'series', 'up', 'start', '1960', 'just', 'when', 'jazz', 'was', 'due', 'enter', 'most', 'creative', 'period', 'little', 'giving', 'history', 'classical', 'music', 'stopping', 'end', 'Baroque', 'era', 'thereby', 'leaving', 'out', 'Mozart', 'Beethoven', 'al', 'totally', 'ignorant', 'misleading', 'jazz', 'stopped', '1961', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'started', '2', 'series', 'deeply', 'racist', 'jazz', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'black', 'experience', 'be', 'central', 'thesis', 'many', 'greatest', 'early', 'exponents', 'were', 'black', 'little', 'appreciation', 'basis', 'jazz', 'folk', 'popular', 'idioms', 'US', 'Europe', 'created', 'generations', 'white', 'musicians', 'analysis', 'greatest', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'current', 'era', 'reveals', 'be', 'open', 'arena', 'Blacks', 'Whites', 'Hispanics', 'important', 'contributors', 'Maybe', 'reason', 'Burns', 'stopping', '1960', 'central', 'theme', 'jazz', 'being', 'exclusive', 'arena', 'black', 'people', 'even', 'shakier', 'period', 'find', 'racist', 'view', 'simplistic', 'patronising', 'offensive', 'deeply', 'ignorant', 'Here', 'production', 'major', 'axe', 'grind', 'beware', '3', 'Why', 'reliance', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'Do', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'jazz', 'actually', 'guy', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognise', 'fine', 'trumpeter', 'How', 'managed', 'set', 'up', 'Mr', 'Jazz', 'really', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'great', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'past', 'present', 'preserver', 'jazz', 'not', 'creator', 'curator', 'art', 'gallery', 'jazz', 'not', 'Picasso', 'Pollock', 'Why', 'were', ""n't"", 'more', 'significant', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'consulted', '4', 'Jazz', '1960', 'was', 'great', 'music', 'time', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'creative', 'grown', 'subtlety', 'complexity', 'as', 'well', 'all-round', 'creativity', 'pre-1960', 'jazz', 'now', 'pretty', 'pale', 'comparison', 'more', 'recent', 'jazz', 'are', 'who', 'do', 'still', 'listen', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'Duke', 'Ellington', 'Dizzy', 'Gillespie', 'other', 'luminaries', 'jazz', 'formative', 'years', 'majority', 'jazz', 'followers', 'are', 'looking', 'newer', 'musicians', 'styles', 'essence', 'jazz', 'creative', 'always', 'trying', 'move', 'forward', 'find', 'new', 'ways', 'expressing', 'looking', 'new', 'vocabulary', 'Let', 'hear', 'more', 'what', 'jazz', 'not', 'what', 'then', 'major', 'two', 'thumbs', 'deeply', 'ignorant', 'offensive', 'production', 'someone', 'who', 'clearly', 'poor', 'taste', 'rather', 'questionable', 'agenda', 'are', 'interested', 'finding', 'out', 'great', 'musical', 'genre', 'called', 'jazz', 'what', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'route', 'Here', 'better', 'suggestion', 'go', 'Amazon', 'recommended', 'lists', 'do', 'own', 'research', 'Two', 'things', 'are', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'save', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'relevant', 'music']",N/A
