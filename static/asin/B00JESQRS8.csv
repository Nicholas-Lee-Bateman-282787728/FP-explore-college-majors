I'm sick to death of brainless, blockbuster CGI-heavy garbage where absolutely no thought was given to just telling a good yarn, and maybe making it engaging by focusing on character and the human element.FAVOR is a stripped-down thriller, bare and simple and terrific.  It's everything movies should be and aren't.  It kept me glued to the screen and the twists knocked me off my seat.  I checked this out as a rental on iTunes and have been waiting patiently for the DVD, which is now coming.

It has no &#34;known&#34; celebrities, but the actors in it are excellent. I will not give away any of the plot, except to say that it surprised me. Very good movie, great plot and as I said earlier the actors are great.

1696572,ASYKUKD5MW46V,B00JESQRS8,T,"[1, 1]","This is a better movie than I expected. Not exactly the action film I'm use to. I would put it in the category of personal relationships and lessons to be learned. One childhood friend ask the other for a BIG favor and once done, never hears the end of it. It also reveals the friends true characters as the movie unfolds. I thought it was a good movie because I did not anticpate all the turns in the plot that took place. Usually, you know what comes next in some of these bad movies. Kudos to the actor who played the character of Marvin - he was great.So, if you are looking for a good plot and story, watch this one. My only negative was that it cost $3.99. $2.99 would have been better.",5,Not bad for a movie not in the main stream,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,692,"['better', 'movie', 'expected', 'Not', 'exactly', 'action', 'film', ""'m"", 'use', 'would', 'put', 'category', 'personal', 'relationships', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'One', 'childhood', 'friend', 'ask', 'other', 'BIG', 'favor', 'once', 'done', 'never', 'end', 'also', 'friends', 'true', 'characters', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'anticpate', 'turns', 'plot', 'took', 'place', 'Usually', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'bad', 'movies', 'Kudos', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'character', 'Marvin', 'was', 'great.So', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'plot', 'story', 'watch', 'one', 'only', 'negative', 'was', 'cost', '3.99', '2.99', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better']",Favor
1696573,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00JESQRS8,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","Kip (Blayne Weaver) has it all: A beautiful wife (Cheryl Nichols), a nice house (except for painted cinder block walls), a great job, a beautiful mistress (Rosalie Ward) and a friend Marvin (Patrick Day) who helps him bury dead bodies. Of course being out of work, Marvin performs the dirty deed. Marvin has a very nice collection of recently emptied green beer bottles decorating his home. He requires favors in return from Kip that escalate.This is a simple quirky low budget film with some uncomfortable settings and a nice twist of events. Acting and direction was decent. Limited flashbacks done well, i.e. you knew they were flashbacks and they served a purpose. Good pick for &#34;Indie Night.&#34;If you like this film, you might also like &#34;Meeting Evil&#34; which has a higher intensity factor.Parental Guide: F-bomb.
