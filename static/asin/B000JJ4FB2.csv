1026687,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B000JJ4FB2,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[5, 6]","Dark Remains is a brave and mostly quite accomplished attempt at a ""Grudge""/""Evil Dead"" style horror film which works at making you jump but is sadly in need of a good script. A couple named Alan and Julie lose their young daughter when she is brutally and unnaccountably murdered in her bed by persons unknown. The distraught couple move out to a remote cabin in the woods to come to terms with their grief, but it turns out that the cabin is not the most peaceful place for them to be, as several of it's former occupants have died mysteriously, and soon the couple are fighting for their lives and their sanity.Let me say first off that for a low budget independant production (which I think this is), the film has a lot going for it. If you are of a nervous dispositon and don't like being made to jump, then this film could give you nightmares. Once Alan and Julie arrive at the cabin and start getting spooked, the scare scenes never let up. Ghostly faces appear behind every window or mirror, things drop and clatter on the floor unexpectedly and doors and windows keep opening and closing with no warning. It actually gets quite wearing to be constantly waiting for the next ghoulish figure to pop up over someones shoulder or glide down a distant corridor. However, the ghosts, when they appear are spooky enough, and some of the surprises are very well done. Camera work and frame compostion are very nice, although a lot of it, such as close ups and montages of ordinary things like Julie having a shower or photographing an abandoned prison that happens to be next door to the cabin seem to be little more than attractive padding. It almost seems like there is nothing to do but watch the screen for the next ghost.This brings me to the films major failing. When the ghosts are not on screen, there simply isn't enough happening. And there isn't much attempt to develop Alan and Julie as human beings. The two leads are competent actors but they barely speak to each other. Despite their relationship since the death of their daughter being crucial to the atmosphere, the conversations between the two are limited to mere scraps of words at a time, such as ""I'm going to take more photos"" or ""I don't feel right here"". It's ok that the couple are greiving and not communicating, but as a viewer I needed more insight into their characters to be able to understand their motivations. I could almost see in the eyes of the actress playing Julie the craving to actually have something more significant to say than ""I'm tired"" or ""I don't feel like it"", over and over again. Because of the lack of decent conversations or visible personalities in anyone, the film boils down to being an exercise in looking at spooky imagery without having any involvements with the characters being menaced.So in some ways the film is a failure, and it is crying out for a script to put some intellectual meat on it's scary bones. They could have also added more in the way of explanations, as the story ends with a lot of plot holes still unexplained. I'd probably call the film an overall success due to the scares, particularly some terrific scenes of ghoulish figures falling down stairs, or the phantom of the dead daughter cropping up unexpectedly to the great distress of her mother. It also handles that old chestnut of ""characters waking from a dream sequence that we don't know is actually dream at first"" pretty well, too. But a bit more attention paid towards giving the actors real characters to work with would have paid off enormously.",3,Not bad,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,3542,"['Dark', 'Remains', 'brave', 'mostly', 'quite', 'accomplished', 'attempt', 'Grudge', '/', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'style', 'horror', 'film', 'making', 'jump', 'sadly', 'need', 'good', 'script', 'couple', 'named', 'Alan', 'Julie', 'lose', 'young', 'daughter', 'when', 'brutally', 'unnaccountably', 'murdered', 'bed', 'persons', 'unknown', 'distraught', 'couple', 'move', 'remote', 'cabin', 'woods', 'come', 'terms', 'grief', 'out', 'cabin', 'not', 'most', 'peaceful', 'place', 'be', 'several', 'former', 'occupants', 'have', 'died', 'mysteriously', 'soon', 'couple', 'are', 'fighting', 'lives', 'sanity.Let', 'say', 'first', 'off', 'low', 'budget', 'independant', 'production', 'think', 'film', 'lot', 'going', 'are', 'nervous', 'dispositon', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'made', 'jump', 'then', 'film', 'could', 'give', 'nightmares', 'Once', 'Alan', 'Julie', 'arrive', 'cabin', 'start', 'getting', 'spooked', 'scare', 'never', 'let', 'up', 'Ghostly', 'appear', 'window', 'mirror', 'things', 'drop', 'clatter', 'floor', 'unexpectedly', 'doors', 'windows', 'keep', 'opening', 'closing', 'warning', 'actually', 'quite', 'wearing', 'be', 'constantly', 'waiting', 'next', 'ghoulish', 'figure', 'pop', 'up', 'someones', 'shoulder', 'glide', 'down', 'distant', 'corridor', 'However', 'ghosts', 'when', 'appear', 'are', 'spooky', 'enough', 'surprises', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Camera', 'work', 'frame', 'compostion', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'lot', 'such', 'close', 'ups', 'montages', 'ordinary', 'things', 'Julie', 'having', 'shower', 'photographing', 'abandoned', 'prison', 'be', 'next', 'door', 'cabin', 'seem', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'attractive', 'padding', 'almost', 'nothing', 'do', 'watch', 'screen', 'next', 'ghost.This', 'films', 'major', 'failing', 'When', 'ghosts', 'are', 'not', 'screen', 'simply', ""n't"", 'enough', 'happening', ""n't"", 'much', 'attempt', 'develop', 'Alan', 'Julie', 'human', 'beings', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'competent', 'actors', 'barely', 'speak', 'other', 'relationship', 'death', 'daughter', 'being', 'crucial', 'atmosphere', 'conversations', 'two', 'are', 'limited', 'mere', 'scraps', 'words', 'time', 'such', ""'m"", 'going', 'take', 'more', 'photos', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'here', 'ok', 'couple', 'are', 'greiving', 'not', 'communicating', 'viewer', 'needed', 'more', 'insight', 'characters', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'motivations', 'could', 'almost', 'see', 'eyes', 'actress', 'playing', 'Julie', 'craving', 'actually', 'have', 'something', 'more', 'significant', 'say', ""'m"", 'tired', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'over', 'again', 'lack', 'decent', 'conversations', 'visible', 'personalities', 'anyone', 'film', 'down', 'being', 'exercise', 'looking', 'spooky', 'imagery', 'having', 'involvements', 'characters', 'being', 'menaced.So', 'ways', 'film', 'failure', 'crying', 'out', 'script', 'put', 'intellectual', 'meat', 'scary', 'bones', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'added', 'more', 'way', 'explanations', 'story', 'lot', 'plot', 'holes', 'still', 'unexplained', ""'d"", 'probably', 'call', 'film', 'overall', 'success', 'due', 'scares', 'particularly', 'terrific', 'scenes', 'ghoulish', 'figures', 'falling', 'down', 'stairs', 'phantom', 'dead', 'daughter', 'cropping', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'great', 'distress', 'mother', 'also', 'old', 'chestnut', 'characters', 'waking', 'dream', 'sequence', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actually', 'dream', 'first', 'pretty', 'well', 'too', 'bit', 'more', 'attention', 'paid', 'giving', 'actors', 'real', 'characters', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'off', 'enormously']",Dark Remains

Yeah, there were a few and, at times, the movie almost lifts itself out of a morass of leaden acting, weak dialogue, I've-seen-this-before-story, and . . . well, how scary are ghosts that never actually hurt anyone? The ghosts pull the usual on-screen antics of silently creeping behind characters, of running across doorways, and appearing behind a character after they've turned away. Most of the scares are when the ghosts jump out at you or crawl and the music bangs and crashes. We're talking Disney Haunted House stuff for most of the journey.I didn't begin to *get* the character's motivations until late in the last act. Without giving anything away (or any more than I have already), their daughter dies and they move into an isolated home in the hills (though not so isolated that we are never at a loss for neighbors popping in and saying howdy). What follows is dialogue and story below-par with even late night Cinemax fare.It's a poorly written, poorly directly, poorly shot indie film with a few easy scares.

1026696,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000JJ4FB2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 5]","Dark Remains (Brian Avenet-Bradley, 2005)Dark Remains is the back-alley abortion of what could have been a really, really good movie. (For some reason, as I was watching it, I kept comparing it to both Grace and Ring Around the Rosie, though thematically it has nothing to do with either; it is much closer to Shutter.) Given the right treatment, it probably still could be. But what's here is nothing but a mess.Allen (3: The Dale Earnhardt Story's Greg Thompson) and Julie (The Signal's Cheri Christian) Pyke, traumatized by the death of their young daughter Emma (Rachel Jordan), retreat to a secluded cabin in the woods to try and heal. As time goes on, however, and their mental states get worse, Allen starts digging and finds that the house has a history of seemingly driving depressives to suicide. From there, the film becomes a race against time as Allen tries to figure out what's causing the problem as Julie slides deeper and deeper into depression.All of which is well and good, except I know I'm probably leaving out some major plot points. Why? Because beyond a certain point, I found it impossible to understand anything that was going on in this movie. There are all sorts of things going on here, but they're all reflections of other, usually better, movies. (I'll make an exception for Ring Around the Rosie, which was just hysterically bad.) They all get jumbled together like strands of Christmas tree lights; no matter how you try to keep them separate, they tangle up until you've got to spend an entire night picking them apart. No one bothered to spend that night, or even fifteen minutes, trying to make anything intelligible out of the plot points here. The movie's got a good sense of atmosphere and understands that creepy and subtle is better than the stupid jump, and I have to give Avenet-Bradley points for that. But the characters and situations he plonked down in the middle of that atmosphere are not only godawfully stupid, but horribly-acted as well. If you're the kind of person who can listen to a tenth-generation bootleg cassette and hear the crystal clarity of the original concert where it was recorded, you may be able to get enough out of this movie to like it. The rest of you are liable to find yourself holding a tangled mess of Christmas lights and wondering how they always end up this way. *",1,Awful.,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,2344,"['Dark', 'Remains', 'Brian', 'Avenet-Bradley', '2005', 'Dark', 'Remains', 'back-alley', 'abortion', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'reason', 'was', 'watching', 'kept', 'comparing', 'Grace', 'Ring', 'Rosie', 'thematically', 'nothing', 'do', 'much', 'closer', 'Shutter', 'Given', 'right', 'treatment', 'probably', 'still', 'could', 'be', 'what', 'here', 'nothing', 'mess.Allen', '3', 'Dale', 'Earnhardt', 'Story', 'Greg', 'Thompson', 'Julie', 'Signal', 'Cheri', 'Christian', 'Pyke', 'traumatized', 'death', 'young', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'Rachel', 'Jordan', 'retreat', 'secluded', 'cabin', 'woods', 'try', 'heal', 'time', 'however', 'mental', 'states', 'get', 'worse', 'Allen', 'digging', 'house', 'history', 'seemingly', 'driving', 'depressives', 'suicide', 'there', 'film', 'race', 'time', 'Allen', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'causing', 'problem', 'Julie', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'depression.All', 'well', 'good', 'know', ""'m"", 'probably', 'leaving', 'out', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'Why', 'certain', 'point', 'found', 'impossible', 'understand', 'anything', 'was', 'going', 'movie', 'are', 'sorts', 'things', 'going', 'here', ""'re"", 'reflections', 'other', 'usually', 'better', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'make', 'exception', 'Ring', 'Rosie', 'was', 'just', 'hysterically', 'bad', 'get', 'jumbled', 'together', 'strands', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'lights', 'matter', 'how', 'try', 'keep', 'separate', 'tangle', 'up', ""'ve"", 'got', 'spend', 'entire', 'night', 'picking', 'apart', 'one', 'bothered', 'spend', 'night', 'even', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'trying', 'make', 'anything', 'intelligible', 'plot', 'points', 'here', 'movie', 'got', 'good', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'creepy', 'subtle', 'better', 'stupid', 'jump', 'have', 'give', 'Avenet-Bradley', 'points', 'characters', 'situations', 'plonked', 'down', 'middle', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'godawfully', 'stupid', 'horribly-acted', 'well', ""'re"", 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'listen', 'tenth-generation', 'bootleg', 'cassette', 'hear', 'crystal', 'clarity', 'original', 'concert', 'where', 'was', 'recorded', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'enough', 'movie', 'like', 'rest', 'are', 'liable', 'find', 'holding', 'tangled', 'mess', 'Christmas', 'lights', 'wondering', 'how', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'way', '*']",Dark Remains
1026697,A1KVBBRXQ2PWJ7,B000JJ4FB2,Siklootd,"[1, 2]","""Dark Remains"" is an independent horror film that should not be overlooked.  Placing a major emphasis on creating a ""creepy"" and ""disturbing"" environment, the film is full of shocking scenes that are sure to frighten the viewing audience.  The shocking moments come when you least expect them, and the tension remains with the viewer as they expect further shocking surprises at every turn.  The film is good at keeping these scenes evenly paced out, in order to not only build more tension, but to also keep the film interesting without overdoing the ""jump"" moments.The story focuses around a couple, Allen and Julie Pyke, who recently had their young daughter brutally murdered in their home while they were asleep.  Following the murder of their daughter, the two are torn with grief and decide it's best to move away for a while.  So, the couple decides to rent a cabin far away from their home, in order to try to forget and heal their wounds of the past.  Allen uses this time to begin writing a new book while Julie uses the beautiful scenery of the forest as a new subject matter of her photographs.Everything appears to be getting better for the couple, until Julie discovers an abandoned prison located deep within the forest.  She becomes fascinated with the prison, and obsessively continues to return to the site to take photographs of it.  After developing the photos in her dark room, the audience is shown that Julie has actually been photographing spirits that reside within the prison.  With each passing day, Julie slips into a deeper depression, and refuses to leave the cabin.  Allen discovers the truth behind the cabin and its past inhabitants, everyone who has ever lived there has committed suicide after falling into depression.  It becomes Allen's main goal to save his wife from becoming the next victim of the house.From the opening scene until the last scene, ""Dark Remains"" continues to leave the viewer with chills.  Scaring the audience at every turn with sudden appearances of ghosts and other eerie actions, the film always leaves you waiting for the next scary moment, which usually isn't too far away.  The story is good, the acting is decent, and the special effects and scary moments are amazingly done.
