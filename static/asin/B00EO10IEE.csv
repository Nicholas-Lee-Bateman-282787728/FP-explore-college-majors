People who complain that it didn't tell this story or that story need to understand that there's only so much they can say in an hour and thirty minutes.  I thought the film was exactly what it purported to be ... a story about what happened immediately after the president was shot, how they handled him at the hospital and the 2 or 3 days that followed.  The hospital scenes were gripping and I think anyone who's fascinated by the Kennedys should add this to their viewing list.

1667993,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B00EO10IEE,amerdale876,"[5, 14]","I'm being honest when I say I really wanted to like this movie -- I really, really did -- especially with the magnificent cast! But ... I couldn't. Produced by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman, ""Parkland"" is based on the Vincent Bugliosi bookFour Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which is an abridged version of Bugliosi's massive tomeReclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The only reason I gave this movie two stars was because of the performances -- all really well-done and believable (the scene of calling the time of death of the President is certainly one of the most heartwrenching moments I've seen in recent cinema). The story, on the other hand, is full of holes and inconsistencies. I understand what screenwriter/director Peter Landesman was trying to do: he was attempting to not tread on any ""conspiracy"" territory by not fully showing the Zapruder film and the headshot to the President's head; nor did he address the autopsy of the President and the controversy of that ordeal. Landesman probably wanted to simply make a film that stuck to the known, established facts of what happened that day in November rather than some fact that came out years later. The only problem with this approach is that there were events -- important ones -- that happened ""that day"" that were not included in the film at all, whether it was the major -- the most prominent being the President's autopsy, the findings of the bullet entry wounds, the gaping wound in the back of the President's head, or the testimony from several eyewitnesses that JFK's body was disturbed by being unwrapped somewhere between the departure of Parkland Hospital and the arrival in Washington; or the mundane -- Zapruder's receptionist Marilyn Sitzman, who was standing up on the concrete pedestal with Zapruder (because of Zapruder's vertigo) and not down on the ground, like she is portrayed in this film. But I guess Landesman doesn't have time to show any of these facts ... because he's too busy using up nearly five minutes or more simply showing the ""honorable, brave, loyal"" Secret Service agents making room for the President's casket on Air Force One -- a scene not important to the overall story unless you want to glorify an already known aspect of the Secret Service.If anything, this movie is a propaganda tool used at subliminally telling the public who watch it that if you believe Oswald worked for the CIA or did not shoot the President, then you must be a ""crazy, deranged nut"" just like Oswald's mother Marguerite (Jackie Weaver), or some cold, heartless, uptight bureaucrat just like Dallas County Coroner Earl Rose (Rory Cochran), are portrayed in this film. Landesman attempts to simply show the human side of the Kennedy assassination and how it affected the lives of various people that day; however, by not showing all of the facts, Landesman is doing a disservice to his story, the film, U.S. history and our country. The fact that Landesman left out several tidbits of eyewitness-proved events that day with those people with whom the film centers on, proves that this film is not accurate, which is OK if you know absolutely nothing about the JFK assassination. The problem with this is that people (especially young people) will watch this film and think every detail is absolute fact (a similar problem arose with the release of Oliver Stone'sJFK: Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)when it was released in 1991). Therefore, its attempt at being an accurate-yet-dramatic story is a failure. I'm not saying Landesman had to touch on ""conspiracy theory"" here, but he should have done what he set out to do: throw every true fact into his story as possible. That was simply not done. Need proof? Check out James DiEugenio'sReclaiming Parkland: Tom Hanks, Vincent Bugliosi, and the JFK Assassination in the New Hollywood.Some people may ask how do I know the eyewitness testimony of events that day (i.e. in the autopsy, etc.) are real and true. Well, ask yourself this: if one, two or three people -- with nothing to lose and no invested interest or employment with a ""questioned authority"" -- testify to an event and they all say the same thing, is it a concidence? Well, how about if 17 or 25 of these types of people say the same thing? Were all of these random people getting together and plotting on what they would tell investigators? I don't think so. If this movie were made even 20 years ago, I would be more keen to give it a higher rating because of the amount of information -- or lack thereof -- on the Kennedy assassination. But this film was released in 2013 -- after 50 years of investigation which have proven there was MUCH more to that day in Parkland than this movie reveals (Even Sylvia Meagher's 1966 bookAccessories After the Fact: The Warren Commission, the Authorities & the Report on the JFK Assassinationreveals more dramatic fact than this film). This is the antithesis to ""JFK,"" showing the ""Oswald-acted-alone"" theory of the assassination. If ""Parkland"" succeeds at anything, it is for those who watch the movie to read these reviews and investigate for the missed facts, which did indeed happen and are not shown in this film. Read more, research, take in as much fact as possible and use common sense. Don't believe what any movie -- whether it's this one or ""JFK"" -- tells you just because it's what a majority say. It's up to you.",2,I really wanted to like this movie,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,5434,"[""'m"", 'being', 'honest', 'when', 'say', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'really', 'really', 'did',

1667997,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00EO10IEE,Annie Van Auken,"[6, 6]","PLOT POINTS REVEALED!.PARKLAND (2013) is an inside look at the JFK assassination that shows scenes and examines lives never before represented in a motion picture. It opens mere minutes before the Kennedy limo turns onto Elm St. We see Abe Zapruder (Paul Giamatti) and his secretary cross the street to a platform near the grassy knoll. Abe's viewpoint was 30 yards distant from where the kill shot got JFK. He was a wreck from this traumatic experience and never fully recovered. Referring to JFK, Zapruder told a persistent newspaperman that ""his head just flew to pieces.""Soon after, Zapruder's surrounded by agents, including the chief of Dallas Secret Service (Billy Bob Thornton) who flat out demands the film in his 8mm Bell & Howell camera, Instead, Abe and several agents went from lab to TV station trying to find someone to develop the film.Meanwhile, the dark blue limo has arrived at Parkland at 12:45 pm, five minutes after the shooting. We see JFK placed on a stretcher and whyeeled into an emergency room that immediately was overcrowded with doctors, nurses and JFK's entourage. Every step of their fruitless efforts to keep him alive is shown. Jackie wandewrs in, totally spattered with blood. She hands head nurse Marcia Gay Harden something. We're told it's a piece of skull and brains. Jackie moves to a corner, kneels and prays as last ditch heart massage is about to fail. The nurse goes to her locker and retrieves a large wooden crucifix. She hands it to Father Huber, who's administering last rites on the president's remains. He lays the cross on the chest. Later, after the interior of Air Force One is torn away to accomodate JFK's bronze casket, this crucifix is placed on it.The detail throughout is just remarkable.Perhaps the weirdest story is that of the Oswald family, brother Robert (James Badge Dale) and Lee's mom, Marguerite (Jacki Weaver). The old woman is clearly deranged, and not by this accusation against her son. Repeatedly she claims he's a CIA agent, when not demanding a payoff from LIFE magazine for her inside story. Robert is appalled, convinced his arrogant younger brother killed ""the most important man in the world."" He's abused by Dallas cops, told to leave town and change his name, and generally despised as much as Lee.On Sunday morning, an official arrives at the Oswald home to inform them that Lee's been shot, but he's gonna be OK. Then a call comes in: JFK's accused killer is dead. Marguerite's reaction is incredible. She says, ""My son is a hero, a government agent. They should bury him at Arlington alongside the president.""We also learn of Dallas-based FBI agent James Hosty (Ron Livingston). He'd been tracking Oswald's activities for months, something Hosty's boss was unaware of. After they hear that Oswald's been arrested and is prime suspect in the assassination, Hosty is questioned about an incident that occurred just 10 days earlier. Oswald had stopped by CIA headquarters to both complain that Hosty was speaking to his wife and to threaten he'd blow the place up if these conversations continued. Hosty's boss explodes in anger, for this threat on a Federal facility, real or idle, was a felony and Oswald should've been immediately taken into custody for making it. If Hosty wants to save his job, he's ordered to burn his Oswald file. He does as he's told.There is so much more I haven't mentioned.If you're at all interested in this historic American tragedy, PARKLAND is an absolute must-see.",5,"Abraham Zapruder: ""Oh my God!

things I found puzzeling?Did the secret service have AR-15's/M-16's as issued automatic weapons in 1963?it seems to me that Thompson M1A1's would have been around in that time,as the US Army issued M14's back then and M16's in 1965 as their automatic/semi automatic solder weapons or standard weapons to GI's,probably M60's as squad machine guns in Vietnam in the day?maybe I'm wrong?It just seems odd that they would use an unproven new weapon in Presidental protection detail?after all the Thompson had been around since WW1 and a proven weapon?Also the scene where they moved the coffin onto Air Force 1 and busted out the entire wall by the door to move the coffin onto the plane?The plane is at the U S Dayton Air Force museum and show's a small piece of wall broken out and repaired with a metal molding,not the entire wall?This was probably done for dreamatic effect for the movie.I went to Dealy plaza to the Sixth floor museam a while back and looked out the window(actually the next window because the corner window is glassed off along with the boxes he used to perch the rifle and some chicken bones from his lunch) that Oswald shot from and concluded that he must have been a hell of a great shot to do all that damage!To me a better shot would of been when the limo turned onto Elm street or Houston,whatever is was,from the parade route,anyway it would have been a lot closer without the tree in the way?I guess we'll never know why?I even walked up to the railroad bridge by the grassy knowl to get a total perspective.The only sign on the street by where he was shot is a bronze plaque on the sidewalk saying &#34;a significant historical event happened there&#34;,at least in 1998 that is.There is a outside display of the events a couple of blocks away,a memmorial tribuate from the City of Dallas and of course the musuem in the School Book depository.The Presidental limo is on display in Dearborn Michigan at the Henry Ford museum as they legally own the car and leased it to the government.The car designated X-100,a Lincoln Continental Convertable has been rebuilt with a hard top and repainted black but still a haunting memmory.I watched it twice and like anybody that was around back then(I was 8 years old and in the 4th grade and a call went out over the classroom speakers for all teachers to go to the principals office now and then we were dismissed early to go straight home)I found it very distressing to watch and relive those events again.Every home was glued to the TV for coverage the next few days and the assisination of Oswald was live on Sunday for all to see!!Also the presidental funeral was sad on Monday the 25th(Jon Jon's birthday and 2 days away from Caroline's birthday and my birthday on Thanksgiving that year)!!sad!!America's

And to place so much emphasis on his brother's view that his brother Lee was guilty is a laughable tragedy.  It's beyond doubt now that the Warren Commision committed crimes in  the cover-up, obfuscation and destruction of evidence along with the intimidation of key witnesses as well as the complete disregard of others. They may have been focused on a 'benign coverup' but they committed crimes and they ripped to shreds any trust and confidence that the American people once had in the Federal Government. Their Crime compounded a Murder Conspiracy that no doubt involved certainly rogue elements of the CIA, Secret Service, MIlitary Intelligence, The International Mafia. I'm convinced as are many other Americans, that the higher ups in our Federal Government knew of this Conspiracy before the Murder and felt they had to cover the truth of it up for 'the good' of the 'people'. It's sad that after all the evidence that has recently come about, that these writers and produces just ignored the truth again and tried to re-packaged the same old tired PC  BS.

The only good thing about this film was the excellent picture quality and the fact that they at least made the actors resemble the actual people.  The picture quality was great and it showed 1963 technology (I was not there) in vivid HD!  I had the opportunity to see the old cars, clothes and electronics as they would have been (I assume) if I had been there.  When you see these things in black in white, it looks even older!  THIS part of the film was great.Now, as far as the film itself goes - anything based on parrot Vincent Buigliosi and his constant protection of a coup, is bound to have the usual story (Oswald did it and he was low down, but the government is great) and the usual ways.  This film was not even needed, but was made to reinforce the hoax of Oswald killing JFK for the 50th anniversary of JFK's death.  The film makers claim that they are not dealing with conspiracy theories, but they made sure to project people who promoted conspiracy in a bad light.From her first appearance, Margaret Oswald was made too look like a lunatic talking about Lee Oswald having been a government agent on a secret mission.  Her other son, Robert, rebukes her and gives the audience (not much of one since this film flopped!) the impression that she is a nut and he is the straight laced one telling it like it was.  They made HIM a hero while disrespecting his mother and brother.  I wonder why we never hear about John Pic (Oswald's other brother) in these films?Well, they made Oswald's mother seem concerned with money from writing a book (she did release an album to make money as she was shut out from employment) and her continued claims that Lee was a government agent.  Of course with all of the 'secret agent' films over the decades, when people hear that someone was an 'agent' they think super spy and that unless the government confirmed it, anyone making such claims are sick.  They made Margaret look like a fool throughout the movie.  She was the contrary.  You know mothers know their children and want to protect them.  She was clear in his work for the government.  The guy WAS a Marine and JFK was in the Navy, which commands the Marines, so Oswald was a government agent!  Of course whatever else he was into, only his mother could speculate, but she divulged more than any government source, but they could not kill the man's mother, it would look suspicious.  His stay in the Soviet Union was clearly the actions of an agent for a deep cover story.  I have my strong theories how he got picked for a patsy, but I might write a book!Lastly, there was more subjective subliminal stuff in the film as in the scene where Zapruder was talking to a Life Magazine rep.  Zapruder stated: ""I was not filming a WAR, I filmed a murder!""  That was an interesting line there.  It seemed designed to guide the audiences thoughts away from coup, as a coup is WAR.  Calling it a simple murder is there way of trying to convey that Oswald did it and he alone, for reason unknown and no one cares why.This was a film that was unneeded as it did not add anything new, but if you want to get an idea of the events in color, then it is worth seeing for that, not for the real deal on the killing.  It cost $10M to make and only made $600K.  No one cared about this film.  This film does not care about the truth either.",3,Made for Propaganda Purposes Only!,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,3374,"['Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'how', 'have', 'Blu-Ray', 'already', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', 'fact', 'least', 'made', 'actors', 'resemble', 'actual', 'people', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'great', 'showed', '1963', 'technology', 'was', 'not', 'there', 'vivid', 'HD', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'old', 'cars', 'clothes', 'electronics', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'assume', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'When', 'see', 'things', 'black', 'white', 'even', 'older', 'THIS', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'great.Now', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'anything', 'based', 'parrot', 'Vincent', 'Buigliosi', 'constant', 'protection', 'coup', 'bound', 'have', 'usual', 'story', 'Oswald', 'did', 'was', 'low', 'down', 'government', 'great', 'usual', 'ways', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'needed', 'was', 'made', 'reinforce', 'hoax', 'Oswald', 'killing', 'JFK', '50th', 'anniversary', 'JFK', 'death', 'film', 'makers', 'claim', 'are', 'not', 'dealing', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'made', 'sure', 'project', 'people', 'who', 'promoted', 'conspiracy', 'bad', 'light.From', 'first', 'appearance', 'Margaret', 'Oswald', 'was', 'made', 'too', 'look', 'lunatic', 'talking', 'Lee', 'Oswald', 'having', 'been', 'government', 'agent', 'secret', 'mission', 'other', 'son', 'Robert', 'audience', 'not', 'much', 'one', 'film', 'flopped', 'impression', 'nut', 'straight', 'laced', 'one', 'telling', 'was', 'made', 'HIM', 'hero', 'disrespecting', 'mother', 'brother', 'wonder', 'why', 'never', 'hear', 'John', 'Pic', 'Oswald', 'other', 'brother', 'films', 'Well', 'made', 'Oswald', 'mother', 'seem', 'concerned', 'money', 'writing', 'book', 'did', 'release', 'album', 'make', 'money', 'was', 'shut', 'out', 'employment', 'continued', 'claims', 'Lee', 'was', 'government', 'agent', 'course', ""'secret"", 'agent', 'films', 'decades', 'when', 'people', 'hear', 'someone', 'was', ""'agent"", 'think', 'super', 'spy', 'government', 'confirmed', 'anyone', 'making', 'such', 'claims', 'are', 'sick', 'made', 'Margaret', 'look', 'fool', 'movie', 'was', 'contrary', 'know', 'mothers', 'know', 'children', 'want', 'protect', 'was', 'clear', 'work', 'government', 'guy', 'WAS', 'Marine', 'JFK', 'was', 'Navy', 'Marines', 'so', 'Oswald', 'was', 'government', 'agent', 'course', 'else', 'was', 'only', 'mother', 'could', 'speculate', 'divulged', 'more', 'government', 'source', 'could', 'not', 'kill', 'man', 'mother', 'would', 'look', 'suspicious', 'stay', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'clearly', 'actions', 'agent', 'deep', 'cover', 'story', 'have', 'strong', 'theories', 'how', 'got', 'picked', 'patsy', 'might', 'write', 'book', 'Lastly', 'was', 'more', 'subjective', 'subliminal', 'stuff', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'Zapruder', 'was', 'talking', 'Life', 'Magazine', 'rep.', 'Zapruder', 'stated', 'was', 'not', 'filming', 'WAR', 'filmed', 'murder', 'was', 'interesting', 'line', 'there', 'seemed', 'designed', 'guide', 'audiences', 'thoughts', 'away', 'coup', 'coup', 'WAR', 'Calling', 'simple', 'murder', 'there', 'way', 'trying', 'convey', 'Oswald', 'did', 'alone', 'reason', 'unknown', 'one', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'unneeded', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'new', 'want', 'get', 'idea', 'events', 'color', 'then', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'real', 'deal', 'killing', 'cost', '10M', 'make', 'only', 'made', '600K', 'one', 'cared', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'care', 'truth']",N/A
1668017,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B00EO10IEE,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[2, 3]","I like the idea behind ""Parkland,"" writer and director Peter Landesman's 2013 debut film based on Vincent Bugliosi's bookFour Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Many dramas played out in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, the tragic day when U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while traveling in that infamous motorcade. It was such a surreal occurrence, and every person caught up in the whirlwind of panic stood for a moment, ever so briefly, like the proverbial deer caught in headlights. After watching this film, I considered how much our world had changed. Crime, murder, spree killings -- such blood on the streets has become commonplace. Was this traumatic day a demented ground zero for a new society to follow?It's more complicated than that and ""Parkland"" has little time for such contemplation. Clocking in at 93 minutes, the film barely has time for the assassination. But the shooting indeed occurs 10 minutes in and the chaos of speeding cars, screaming secret service agents and slamming doors takes up the remainder of the work. I have no doubt panicky souls stumbled through this most unexpected historical moment. Where Landesman has succeeded is in the film's authenticity. The detail of an era half a century ago has been recreated with extraordinary care.But the great fault of this ultimately average film, is Landesman's inability to stage a shot with a stationary camera. Hand-held rules the day with awkward closeups, abrupt pans and rapid editing. Such modern techniques appear contrived for a period piece. This film is supposed to serve as a window into history, a unique privilege corrupted by Landesman's need to paint his work with rapid strokes. The day's drama was more than enough to hold the audience's interest. This miscalculation cheapens the film and dilutes several very good performances.Most notably is Paul Giamatti as Abraham Zapruder, the Dallas resident who fatefully filmed the assassination with his 8mm camera (Image of an Assassination - A New Look at the Zapruder Film). Giamatti's work, as usual, is excellent. But you have to watch closely as Landesman seems more interested in showing half of his face or cutting away quickly as if suffering from attention-deficit disorder. Giamatti's Zapruder is devastated by what he has filmed, and I was not aware he was convinced the president was dead immediately after the shooting.Zac Efron is provided his most appealing role as young resident Dr. Jim Carrico at Parkland Hospital, half asleep, who strolls into the emergency room to shockingly see the U.S. president lying on the stretcher (We Were There: Revelations from the Dallas Doctors Who Attended to JFK on November 22, 1963). He freezes, as any of us would, but with the assistance of ER Nurse Doris Nelson (Marcia Gay Harden), snaps into action. These frantic scenes, uncomfortably intimate and bloody to boot, are the highlight of ""Parkland."" Men and women desperately work to save the man's life while his wife Jacqueline (Kat Steffens) tearfully looks on. It is a devastating moment which brings the reality of this horrifying day to the surface like never before.The remainder of the film rarely reaches such heights as multiple characters are awkwardly followed. I appreciated the earnest performance of James Badge Dale as Robert Oswald, older brother of accused assassin Lee Harvey (Lee: A Portrait of Lee Harvey Oswald by His Brother). When he hears his brother's name on the radio, he's rendered speechless before leaving his office to visit the Dallas police station. He briefly talks to Lee during a fascinating scene. His accused brother offers nothing and essentially tells him not to worry -- ""Don't get in trouble at work."" The most telling part of this now-historic conversation is not even in the film, in which Robert asks Lee point blank, ""Did you shoot the president?"" Lee's answer, ""Don't go there brother.""The most famous film about the assassination is Oliver Stone'sJFK, the epic work from 1990 which chose to detail endless conspiracies surrounding the crime. Overrated and bombastic, it is never-the-less a dark thriller which plays like a nightmare. ""Parkland"" respectfully avoids any hint of conspiracy, choosing to provide only what is factually known. The trauma of this haunting day runs so deep it has yet to be defined. It's a shame Landesman chose a derivative, V&eacute;rit&eacute; style obscuring his inspired idea.

1668025,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00EO10IEE,Darren,"[6, 12]","This diffused and inconsistent portrayal of the events of 11/22/63 and the few days after it actually contains the kernel of a good idea:  the experiences of the medical personnel at Parkland Hospital as the gory bodies of John F. Kennedy, and, two days later, his accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, got wheeled on stretchers through their front door.  Can you even begin to imagine how mind-blowing all this must have been for the doctors and nurses who happened to work at this unlikely nexus?  Ground Zero for the events that forever changed, and, let's be honest, forever darkened America.Well, that's exactly what we don't get in ""Parkland"".  I had sort of hoped for a creatively conceived and well-written soap opera about the Assassination from the point of view of the hospital personnel and how the event changed their lives.  Instead what I got was yet another ""lone gunman"" brief via Vincent Bugliosi and producer Tom Hanks, in which Kennedy's blown-open head is never shown -- the hand-held camera dancing nervously around it -- and in which the doctors' observations about the nature of the bullet wounds are never discussed, because the inclusion of such material hurts Bugliosi's brief.  It seems that this subject matter is by its nature hopelessly partisan, and whichever side you stand on is going to color how you present the material and also how you view it as an audience.The partisanship gets worse when we step outside of the hospital.  We follow Abraham Zapruder (another excellent, if brief, performance by national treasure Paul Giamatti) as he makes the world's most famous home movie and is later accosted by the Secret Service and half the world's media.  When it's time to see what he actually captured, we end up getting a closer view of his grandkids on the same film than we get of the assassination itself.  Why?  Again, because it hurts Bugliosi's brief.  The Zapruder film clearly shows that the ""kill shot"" came from the right and front in relation to the President's location.  Welcome to the laws of physics:  ""back, and to the left"".  In ""Parkland"", we see this moment as reflected through Giamatti's eyeglasses as he watches in horror.  Whatever.  You can view it for yourself -- clearly, without reflection -- on countless uploads on YouTube.We also get to know Oswald's mother and brother.  As diagrammed in the movie, each character is designed to be a mouthpiece for the opposing points of view about the Assassination, the mother insisting Lee was framed, the brother instantly assuming Lee's guilt the moment he hears the name on the radio.  The mother is portrayed as a mean-spirited fruitcake who, if she had a long mustache, would be evilly twisting the ends of it.  ""Tell LIFE Magazine I want my advance in CASH!""  Meanwhile, the brother stoically goes about the business of attending to the family's honor.  Guess who we're supposed to believe and sympathize with?  The prosecutor continues to make his case.  In any case, neither character is real; they're cartoons, and would've stayed that way even if they'd had more screen-time.However, we're puzzled when the movie starts blowing apart its own brief when it goes to the local FBI offices and the mini-drama surrounding Agent James Hosty.  Without belaboring the details, I think the filmmakers are trying to explain that what happened to the FBI's dossier on Oswald was a typical CYA operation so common with bureaucracies ... but, ironically, the very admission of a cover-up, even a mundane one as presented, only encourages conspiracy-mongering.  The prosecution loses that round badly.Anyway, it was interesting to learn how the Secret Service managed to get the Presidential coffin aboard Air Force One without having to dump it in the cargo hold.  The depiction of Jackie as a desolated angel, however, doesn't quite ring true with the footage available or with the testimony of witnesses who were almost appalled by her resoluteness.  This movie has her crying throughout.  Jackie wasn't much of a crier.Vincent Bugliosi is a prosecutor.  Prosecutors prefer clear-cut cases where a perpetrator commits a crime and is punished for it.  You know what? -- he may even be right in this case.  But he may be wrong.  His, and the Warren Commission's, theory is just one of many.  When we're on a jury, a lawyer will present ... and withhold ... evidence that will help persuade us to his or her point of view.  Too much evidence is withheld in ""Parkland"" to convince me that Bugliosi is right.  I think they should've made that soap opera instead.  2 out of 5.",2,The Bugliosi brief,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,4571,"['diffused', 'inconsistent', 'portrayal', 'events', '11/22/63', 'few', 'days', 'actually', 'kernel', 'good', 'idea', 'experiences', 'medical', 'personnel', 'Parkland', 'Hospital', 'gory', 'bodies', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'accused', 'assassin', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'got', 'wheeled', 'stretchers', 'front', 'door', 'Can', 'even', 'begin', 'imagine', 'how', 'mind-blowing', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'who', 'happened', 'work', 'unlikely', 'nexus', 'Ground', 'Zero', 'events', 'forever', 'changed', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'forever', 'darkened', 'America.Well', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Parkland', 'had', 'sort', 'hoped', 'creatively', 'conceived', 'well-written', 'soap', 'opera', 'Assassination', 'point', 'view', 'hospital', 'personnel', 'how', 'event', 'changed', 'lives', 'Instead', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'yet', 'lone', 'gunman', 'brief', 'Vincent', 'Bugliosi', 'producer', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Kennedy', 'blown-open', 'head', 'never', 'shown', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'dancing', 'nervously', 'doctors', 'observations', 'nature', 'bullet', 'wounds', 'are', 'never', 'discussed', 'inclusion', 'such', 'material', 'Bugliosi', 'brief', 'subject', 'matter', 'nature', 'hopelessly', 'partisan', 'whichever', 'side', 'stand', 'going', 'color', 'how', 'present', 'material', 'also', 'how', 'view', 'audience.The', 'partisanship', 'worse', 'when', 'step', 'hospital', 'follow', 'Abraham', 'Zapruder', 'excellent', 'brief', 'performance', 'national', 'treasure', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'home', 'movie', 'later', 'accosted', 'Secret', 'Service', 'world', 'media', 'When', 'time', 'see', 'what', 'actually', 'captured', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'closer', 'view', 'grandkids', 'same', 'film', 'get', 'assassination', 'Why', 'Again', 'Bugliosi', 'brief', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'clearly', 'kill', 'shot', 'came', 'right', 'front', 'relation', 'President', 'location', 'Welcome', 'laws', 'physics', 'back', 'left', 'Parkland', 'see', 'moment', 'reflected', 'Giamatti', 'eyeglasses', 'horror', 'can', 'view', 'clearly', 'reflection', 'countless', 'uploads', 'YouTube.We', 'also', 'get', 'know', 'Oswald', 'mother', 'brother', 'diagrammed', 'movie', 'character', 'designed', 'be', 'mouthpiece', 'opposing', 'points', 'view', 'Assassination', 'mother', 'insisting', 'Lee', 'was', 'framed', 'brother', 'instantly', 'assuming', 'Lee', 'guilt', 'moment', 'name', 'radio', 'mother', 'portrayed', 'mean-spirited', 'fruitcake', 'who', 'had', 'long', 'mustache', 'would', 'be', 'evilly', 'twisting', 'ends', 'Tell', 'LIFE', 'Magazine', 'want', 'advance', 'CASH', 'Meanwhile', 'brother', 'stoically', 'business', 'attending', 'family', 'honor', 'Guess', 'who', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'sympathize', 'prosecutor', 'make', 'case', 'case', 'character', 'real', ""'re"", 'cartoons', 'would', ""'ve"", 'stayed', 'way', 'even', ""'d"", 'had', 'more', 'screen-time.However', ""'re"", 'puzzled', 'when', 'movie', 'blowing', 'apart', 'own', 'brief', 'when', 'local', 'FBI', 'offices', 'mini-drama', 'surrounding', 'Agent', 'James', 'Hosty', 'belaboring', 'details', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'trying', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'FBI', 'dossier', 'Oswald', 'was', 'typical', 'CYA', 'operation', 'so', 'common', 'bureaucracies', 'ironically', 'very', 'admission', 'cover-up', 'even', 'mundane', 'one', 'presented', 'only', 'conspiracy-mongering', 'prosecution', 'round', 'badly.Anyway', 'was', 'interesting', 'learn', 'how', 'Secret', 'Service', 'managed', 'get', 'Presidential', 'coffin', 'aboard', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'having', 'dump', 'cargo', 'hold', 'depiction', 'Jackie', 'desolated', 'angel', 'however', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ring', 'true', 'footage', 'available', 'testimony', 'witnesses', 'who', 'were', 'almost', 'appalled', 'resoluteness', 'movie', 'crying', 'Jackie', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'crier.Vincent', 'Bugliosi', 'prosecutor', 'Prosecutors', 'prefer', 'clear-cut', 'cases', 'where', 'perpetrator', 'crime', 'punished', 'know', 'what', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'right', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'theory', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'When', ""'re"", 'jury', 'lawyer', 'will', 'present', 'withhold', 'evidence', 'will', 'help', 'persuade', 'point', 'view', 'Too', 'much', 'evidence', 'withheld', 'Parkland', 'convince', 'Bugliosi', 'right', 'think', 'should', ""'ve"", 'made', 'soap', 'opera', 'instead', '2', '5']",N/A

I can now see why it was only in our local theatres for about 48 hours (which is why I bought the DVD) and was gone before I could get there to see it.

I have the basic knowledge of the Kennedy assassination but have found no compelling alternative reason to debunk the findings of the Warren Commission.  I don't think former journalist and first-time director Peter Landesman is trying to advance a personal agenda here but to illustrate the mood of the country during that tragic time.  He does so by weaving a rich tapestry of events, moments, and characters that are on the periphery to get a feel for the national mood of that time fifty years ago today.  I was left with a lot of images that burnished themselves into my mind.  The sight of Jackie cowering in the corner in her blood spattered pink dress in the trauma room at Parkland hospital as concerned medics and Secret Service mill about.  The Secret Service dismantling seats on Air Force One to make room for the fallen President's casket not to relegate him to the indignity of the cargo hold for the flight back to Washington.  A stunned Robert Oswald (James Badge Dale) quizzing his younger brother Lee as to his culpability in the Dallas lockup.  The shocked look on Abraham Zapruder's(Paul Giamatti) face as he films the moment shots are fired on the President's motorcade at Dealey Plaza.  There are many such moments in the film that touch a collective nerve.  The negative reaction this film may engender seems to be more to the fact that it doesn't cowtow to a specific individual's conspiracy theory.  The film should be judged for what it is and not for what it isn't.

It does emphasize the fact the the Dallas FBI destroyed their file on Oswald very quickly after he was shot, which will come as a surprise to many people who watch this film... though millions of us have known this fact for decades as it's on the record...To those who in these comments refer to Oswald's mother as a crackpot, etc...

Director Peter Landesman focuses on the reactions of those involved in the affair, notably Dr. Jim Carrico (Zac Efron), who treated JFK at the Parkland Hospital, and FBI agent James Hosty (Ron Livingston).  The film is shot in cin&eacute;ma-v&eacute;rit&eacute; style, with lots of quick cuts and close-ups on the protagonists with the minimum of climatic scenes.  Sometimes the action drags slightly, but PARKLAND's main concern is to illuminate the human cost of the tragedy - for example, the reaction of dressmaker Abraham Zapruder (Paul Giamatti), whose amateur film of the tragedy constituted the only available record of what actually happened.  Director Landesman shows how the emotional effect of being regularly interrogated by the FBI proved too much for him.  We also see the reaction of the nurses in the Parkland Hospital, who strove to save the President's life but eventually failed.

1668043,AFFOUXPFSRW94,B00EO10IEE,"Dr. Rob ""Rob""","[24, 44]","I purchased this film for my Kindle Fire. I have been interested in this event since it happened when I was in 1st Grade. I remember that day well. My brother, sister, and I had come home from school for lunch and returned to school. This was a treat because my Dad had a long weekend from his job. He was repainting the ceiling in our family room and living room. And, my Dad was looking forward to the weekend Notre Dame football game on television. My Mom was taking care of my youngest sister who was not school age yet.My siblings and I returned to our respective classrooms. About 1:15 pm CST, our school principal came to our classroom. He was a tall, thin, man about 30 years old. The principal was very serious and not even trying to smile. He told our class that President Kennedy was hurt very badly while visiting Dallas, Texas. Because not much was known about what happened to the President, school was being dismissed as soon as possible. Parents had been called to pick up their children and we were not going to have school on Monday. In relatively short order, we went to our lockers. I remember an occasional drizzle; my Dad was waiting in our family car for us. He was sitting behind the steering wheel and starring at the car radio which he had on. It was not playing music. The newsman was on talking and saying that President Kennedy had been shot to death in Dallas, Texas. This did not make sense to me. President Kennedy was youngish like my Dad. Too young to be dead. Soon, we were home. My Mom was sitting on our sofa. She was very sad and holding my younger sister. My Dad said to my Mom that Johnson would call up the Army and he was still young enough to be recalled (he was a WWII veteran). My Dad was very solemn.That is my personal background. I really don't care about Vincent Bugliosi's spin on the Assassination. Frankly, it is refried hash of the discredited Warren Report. There are factual problems with the film. Claudia Johnson was very kind and considerate of Mrs. Kennedy at Parkland Hospital and offered her sympathy. Johnson was extraordinarily subdued. He said little and was isolated in the protective Secret Service agent cordon that had been established. These facts are not included. Another fact left out is the Trauma team of Carrico and Perry in particular indicating that the throat wound is a bullet entry wound which is not mentioned at all in this film which is carrying a particular author's spin too far. Whoever was portraying Sen. Ralph Yarborough is not shown at all. There are other events left out of the Trauma Room 1 scenes. This part is dramatic but it is not thorough in presentation. This event is too well known through many sources. Jim Bishop's The Day Kennedy Was Shot and the Jacqueline Kennedy disavowed William Manchester tome, The Death of a President and still others.Then, there are the Abraham Zapruder scenes. The actor for this part is okay. What is not okay is the shorthand with his film. Dan Rather, CBS Dallas Bureau Chief, learns of the Zapruder film and encourages Zapruder to get it developed which Zapruder does. In the meantime, the Secret Service learns of its existence and so does Time/Life executive CD Jackson, a publisher with CIA connections. This is not pointed out in the film at all--and here is a telling flaw in this film. Selective censoring of the facts that occurred. I do not want Bugliosi's version of events--that version contains a deep seated bias, wishing Lee Oswald guilty with no other possibility entertained at all. Unfortunately, Oswald will always remain termed either ""the suspected assassin"" or ""the alleged assassin"" because the US Constitution expressly prohibits trying suspects posthumously no matter how heinous the crime. The Zapruder film is shown, sort of, edited in such a way as nothing of substance is seen. Odd. The Zapruder film has been shown in documentaries, news programs on the networks, and in other films. So, what is the nonsense with not showing the Zapruder film in this movie?Dr. Earl Rose, Medical Examiner for Dallas County, Texas is shown asserting Texas law regarding post mortems for local murders and the Secret Service agents. Frankly, both sides had some right on their respective sides. Mrs. Kennedy being left behind in Dallas had the potential for risking her life or being held by the confederates of the assassin(s) to pressure Washington, DC into granting as of yet unknown demands. Did it not occur to anyone on President Kennedy's staff such as Kennedy Chief of Staff Kenny O'Donnell to ask Dr. Rose to join them on AF1 in order to conduct the autopsy in the safety of Washington, DC or its environs?This movie had the potential for a realistic portrayal of historic events. Instead, it devolves into caricatures and draws its characters as mere shadows. Liberties are taken with verifiable facts--those liberties are an insult to anyone who was around when this murder happened.

1668046,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00EO10IEE,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","PARKLAND (Writ./Dir. Peter Landesman, based on the book by Vincent Bugliosi, 2013, 94 minutes, Playtone Productions) is titled after the name of the Dallas hospital where JFK was taken the day he was assassinated, and is the story of that day and the following three days. It has a very bouncy and slightly annoying ""you-are-there"" cinematographic style which I always despise, but at least they tried not to overdo it.This film is a no-frills, no-nonsense look at the events of those four days and follows a few paths: Abraham Zapruder (a captivating Paul Giamatti performance but then again, when isn't he captivating) and his film's development. The Dallas Secret Service, in particular Agent Sorrels (a most excellent Billy Bob Thornton). The FBI and their desperation in the knowledge that they were surveilling Oswald. Finally, the film follows two very weird parallels no one ever thinks about:It followed then-First Lady Mrs. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson but it also followed Lee Harvey Oswald's brother Bob and their mother. Though a few know of Oswald's widow and children (this film shows a daughter but I thought he had more), it seems no one knew about Bob Oswald, how he stayed in Dallas, raised his kids there and never changed his name. He lived to a ripe old age and I was astonished by that fact.The most astonishing thing I think I learned was that Oswald was taken to Parkland Hospital after he was shot. They refused to allow him to go into the OR where the President had been; we also see his pathetic funeral. Other astonishing things are to be seen (or not) in this movie. I was taken aback at the lack of accuracy in a few instances. To the viewer I leave it, to find those examples.Finally, as I said, there are no conspiracy theories addressed here, no ""grassy knoll shooter"", and the film distinctly and clearly lets us hear three gunshots. This is because Bugliosi's original work was meant to debunk all conspiracy theories and this film sticks to that spirit.An element I loved about the approach is best illustrated by an example: Zapruder keeps filming though at first he does not seem to grasp what he has filmed, and it is at this stunning cinematic moment, with the attention on Zapruder, when we hear the shots. Zapruder hears them and sort of grunts in a distracted way, as if he thought it had been a car backfiring. Yet moments later when he finishes filming he is yelling that the president has been killed.I'm perplexed at Giamatti's apparent acting slip-up (why does he seem oblivious to what he is filming?), unless this was the editor's fault. Either way it is a glaring and annoying problem in such an emotional and otherwise well done scene.Yet there are some ""dummy"" moments too, which I am in no way sufficiently expert to address beyond how dumb they look in the film: an example is the extensive scene when Bob Oswald visits his mother in the police interrogation room. He is allowed to interrogate her--which he does with some apparent experience--and she seems like a crazy old lady. Come on, people, really? The police did not arrest the whole family at least for a short while? Not even for their protection? And then here's Bob Oswald questioning Mrs. Oswald alone in a police interrogation room.Another example I can cite is one character--and I admit I do not know who he is, which is significant--persistently addresses the First Lady as ""Jackie"". The fifteenth time I heard it I was almost ready to stop watching, but the film frankly was good enough to prevent me. Also vital in my decision to keep watching was Giamatti, since I watch nearly everything he does.Much of this movie's weird spirit, in fact, is the only minor beef I have with this movie aside from the anachronisms, errors and Zac Efron being used as a cardboard cutout (he can't really act anyway but still). The problem is a double-trouble scenario and it involves the authorities allowing the civvies to run things. Abraham Zapruder is treated here as if he were in control of the development of the film--and the moment Agent Sorrels impounds custody of the film, he immediately and totally gives it back to Zapruder's custody.Do you really believe the authorities worked like that?--what's worse, the police (or sheriff's department) seem to put Bob Oswald in charge of investigating his family (meaning his mad old mother). It overstrains credulity to expect the audience to believe that Zapruder on the one hand and Bob Oswald on the other are two important men in charge of things here. I may be wrong, but as I recall Zapruder developed his film and studied it, only later involving the authorities. Until that time, they did not know about Zapruder, and he didn't know he had actually filmed the president's assassination.Wallywood strikes again ....It was extremely well done, as was the entire film and most especially was the use of genuine media, radio, TV of the time instead of trying to recreate those announcements. I liked the prominence of David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite. As a historical dramatization, let's just say it's clear a lot of people are bobbing for awards here but the film has tremendous value. No one has ever made a film like this, covering these basics--and after this, I suspect no one will ever make another film about it.Amazon customers/readers, this is a film review as you ought to know. Please, do not post comments under my review about how stupid my review is, how the history is all wrong, things of that nature ... please, comment on the film, I beg you, or not at all. If it makes you feel better, for many of the same reasons I love Oliver Stone'sJFK....After all, I didn't make the movie--I'm just reviewing the thing. As lacking as it was in some ways, I really liked it overall and recommend it highly.",4,"""He is going to die for what he has done."" -Bob Oswald, Lee H.

Being familiar with some of the facts, I can say that, largely, they do a pretty solid job, though the take some modest liberties in order to present some moments a bit more dramatically for a theatrical audience; still these are small details that don't amount to historical revisionism so much as they are creative choices -- when you only have two hours to explore the details, you do have some limitations.  If anything, I'd have to say some of the portrayals may've been a bit too dry (Billy Bob has only a handful of scenes, and its hard to sense any real grounding for his character, though he has one nice shouting moment that underscores an intense dedication to duty and service).  If anything, Parkland will make you long for investigating these events even more, as the limitations of a theatrical release do hold the story back in some aspects.

Kennedy while he was riding in his motorcade through the streets of Dallas, Texas.  As if the tragedy of this day weren't horrific enough, the JFK assassination is also one of the most heavily analyzed events because of the sudden disarray the government experienced - never mind the possibility of a massive cover-up.  Naturally, the series of events in Dallas has prompted the creation of several Hollywood productions, including JFK, Executive Action, and In the Line of Fire.  Most of those films focus on the assassination directly, but there really hasn't been a film that focuses on the individuals that played an essential role in trying to save JFK and protect his body after his death - until now.  In the new film, Parkland - the doctors and the video tape that documented the assassination take center stage.Based on the book Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy by Vincent Bugliosi and directed by Peter Landesman, Parkland stars Paul Giamatti as Abraham Zapruder, the man that videotaped the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  Word quickly spreads that someone had the events on camera, prompting Secret Service Agent Forrest Sorrels (Billy Bob Thornton) to have it quickly developed.  At the same time, JFK's body was transported to Parkland Hospital where the doctors on staff, including Dr. Jim Carrico (Zac Efron) and Dr. Malcom O. Perry (Colin Hanks), attempted to save the president's life.  Following the president's death, the Secret Service controversially reclaim the body and move to return the yet to be sword in Vice President, Lyndon B. Johnson, to Washington D.C.  Tom Welling, Mark Duplass, Jacki Weaver, James Badge Dale, and Jackie Earle Haley also star in supporting roles.While I'm a diehard lover of history, there's just something about most history films that always leave a bad taste in my mouth.  The abundance of history flicks is usually a good thing (as far as the entertainment value goes) and if they help get more people interested in history, that's great.  Films about history figures, like Abraham Lincoln, are always interesting because he was never documented on video.  My beef is with films, like Parkland and W., that depict events that don't require a Hollywood production.  For instance, George W. Bush is alive and well, and most everything he ever did in office is quickly interpreted in a mere two hours in W.  What's the point?  Everything the man has done is basically on camera for anyone to watch on YouTube or through various media outlets.  The same goes for the JFK assassination, especially since there is an abundance of documentaries - some presenting the facts and others full of conspiracy theories, that chronicles the events of his assassination.  My point here is that many of the real life people, including Abraham Zapruder and Dr. Malcom O. Perry, are all on record depicting their version of events.  There's no need to create (at this point in time) a seemingly pointless reproduction using famous actors to depict already well-documented events.Parkland attempts to bite off more than it can chew, often throwing a ton of brutally important information at you in a short amount of time.  It follows several different plot lines, including the Zapruder tape, JFK's trip to the hospital, Lee Harvey Oswald's brother and mother, and a handful of Secret Service members.  And, the worst part about all of it is the fact that each of these subjects, which have books written about them on their own, are terribly minimized - while other subjects, like the possibility of a different shooter other than Oswald, is completely trivialized.  More often than not, Parkland lacks a driving point and a clear cut message.  Sure, the film has its facts in order, but it would appear this film's only goal was to show the expressions of people's faces during this devastating day.  I don't know about you, but Zac Efron looking at JFK's body lying lifeless on a table doesn't exactly ""move"" me.In some scenes, more than others, the emotion of the situation is understandably devastating - especially when JFK is lying on a hospital bed as doctors and officials look on helplessly.  There no actor on this planet that could fully encompass the emotions that were flowing on this day.  Still, standing out in this star-studded cast is Paul Giamatti, who is no stranger to historical character acting.  He masterfully portrayed former U.S. President John Adams in an HBO miniseries, and does an equally superb job here as the emotionally distraught and highly conflicted Abraham Zapruder.  James Badge Dale is also quite captivating as Lee Harvey Oswald's brother, Robert.  Dale, along with Jacki Weaver as Marguerite Oswald, brings an interesting dynamic to the screen - showing the reaction of Lee's family members.  Needless to say, the cast is mostly enjoyable, but because of the nature of this story, there really is no main character.In my opinion, you shouldn't need to watch a Hollywood production for modern historical knowledge.  Even though this film coincides with the 50th anniversary of the event, the history of the JFK assassination is heavily documented and now chronicled in-depth by using a minute by minute recap of what was happening.  In any event, Parkland gives attention to individuals that aren't typically in the limelight, focusing on the actions of the doctors, casual observers, along with members of the Oswald family.  Obviously, the portrayed characters of this film play substantial roles in the post-assassination history, making the film a moderately moving experience for those looking to reflect on that day.  In that regard, Parkland is very conventional at times, but the clear goal of this film was obviously to reenact and modernize a tragedy for a new generation.  The problem with that is the various history channels on cable television still do a better job of sharing these events.GRADE: C-FNDNreview.com",2,'Parkland' a pointless studio

1668053,A1AW35YVQ61AA3,B00EO10IEE,Frank Leonidas,"[7, 13]","The film is called Parkland but it has very little to do with the Dallas, Texas hospital for which it is named. Anyone awaiting the long overdo story of the doctors and nurses who first tended to President Kennedy's body following the horrific events of November 22, 1963, may be disappointed. For anyone aware that the Parkland Memorial physicians were all in agreement concerning the findings of the Warren Commission and the ""official"" autopsy of the President's body were totally contrary to what they saw with their own eyes, the film may border on insulting. For a film purportedly about facts, Parkland is astonishingly opinionated. It's a fact that Marguerite Oswald thought her son Lee was an intelligence agent framed for the murder of President Kennedy. It's also a fact that Lee's brother Robert, whom Lee looked up to (Lee was wearing Robert's Marine ring at the time of his arrest -- a point strangely left out of the film), never had any doubts that Lee acted alone and was the sole killer of the President as well as Dallas police officer J.D. Tippet. And I suppose it should be noted that it's indeed a fact Lee Harvey Oswald was tried and convicted by the media and the powers that be in the court of public opinion, before he ever stepped foot out of a Dallas holding cell -- all the while professing his innocence and wrongful arrest. It's a shame that Parkland failed to portray that last particular truth with any clarity in its handling of the seemingly exact and lesser known details that tense and gory day in late November, 1963, some 50 years ago this very month. Not entirely unlike it's predecessor, Oliver Stone's JFK, Parkland has an agenda to expound. Whereas the aim of Stone's densely populated film of characters and ideas was to present ALL the theories it could surrounding the Garrison investigation of a likely conspiracy (later confirmed ""likely"" by our own government), Parkland seems more concerned with passing the research and imagination of one man (writer Vincent Bugliosi) as absolute truth. There's no room for doubt in these proceedings: Oswald was guilty, but the real truth is: his own death kept a lot of white a$$es out of jail (and ostensibly in office) forever crystallizing the mystery surrounding his actual involvement. Otherwise, it's a nearly unwatchable display of amateur theatrics and wasted talent.Zac Efron looks like he wandered onto the big boy's stage fresh from a teen magazine photo spread. He's completely out of his range playing a young resident physician at Parkland Hospital and thoroughly incapable of portraying any semblance of an internal life. He's simply there to look attractive and pound on the dead President's chest in utter desperation after it's too late to save him. With all due respect, he's a good pounder. Billy Bob Thornton portrays Forrest Sorrels, the man (as far as I'm concerned) who was totally at fault for the Secret Service's epic blunder in not protecting Lancer (as Kennedy was known to his Agents; also not mentioned in the film) as well as the biggest f-up in the history of Presidential protection (which is more or less stated in the film at one point). But who was he? All we are led to believe is that Sorrels was a competent, forthright man whose negligence (or over-confidence) gave birth to tragic repercussions. Billy Bob Thornton seems intent on playing him as plainly and believably as possible, as if he were doing some sort of service to a relatively unknown but flawed man. The flaw is not in the way he is played, but rather in what we know today about the real character: which is next to nothing. I have a feeling that Bugliosi took a great many liberties in conjuring up the way Sorrels thought and acted that historic day, but what he doesn't provide is clear enough evidence that Kennedy would not have died by a sniper's bullet had this one man have simply done his job. And why wasn't he held professionally accountable for not protecting the President? Why wasn't anyone? These are not questions explored in Parkland. Rather, Parkland chooses to focus on good people under extreme duress who were forced to make hard decisions (such as where exactly Kennedy's coffin will be situated on Air Force One) whether they were indirectly responsible for the crime or not. The names of critical figures in the story appear on screen in lieu of actual character development; this is afterall a film on the go with a lot of inconsequential material to get through. Speaking of ""development"", a great deal of the early action is spent on the efforts by Abraham Zapruder and the Secret Service to develop the 8mm footage Zapruder fortuitously captured while standing not less than thirty feet away from the murder scene. Zapruder is played by Paul Giamatti who (not surprisingly) turns in the most full-bodied performance.Zapruder starts off giddy to be closing up shop across the street at the Dal-Tex Building, telling all of his lovely-dressed employees that they must all go outside to see the President's motorcade pass. Fate would have it that Zapruder and his secretary would choose the most ideal spot imaginable to take what is widely considered the most important film ever shot in US history. This realization, along with the sickening images he witnessed through the camera lens, are forever engraved on his face thereafter. Zapruder was not a man who held the fate of the President in his own hands, he was simply a guy on his lunch break. He and Sorrels would both etch themselves into history as a result of their choices. It's just a shame that Parkland doesn't draw any real connection between the two. Instead, it just puts them together in several scenes and reminds us that these are names we should all know. Ron Livingston as FBI Agent James Hosty is portrayed as a victim of another sort. Hosty's name should be familiar to fans of the Stone movie, as he was the man who kept a file on Oswald months before the assassination. In the Parkland film, he is not a possible accomplice in a conspiracy, he is simply ordered by his superiors to destroy any evidence that the FBI even knew who Lee Harvey Oswald was, before it makes them look bad for not potentially stopping the President's killer. It's a plausible turn of events I suppose, and one that Hosty clung to for most of his life (he eventually wrote a book) but what we don't get is the context surrounding any of his actions. Hosty was never asked by the Warren Commission anything that could incriminate him or the FBI, therefore he never technically lied about anything, or did anything wrong -- technically speaking. He destroyed the letter that Oswald hand-delivered to him (at the FBI building) supposedly in which Oswald threatened Hosty's life if he didn't leave his family alone, allegedly because Hosty saw it as a personal letter to him, and therefore not an official document. The mere inclusion of Hosty in Parkland opens a whole can of worms that these filmmakers were neither willing nor capable of delving into. It's the only form of cover-up or conspiracy that we are shown on an official level in Parkland and it damns the whole film. The Dallas police are simply portrayed as ignorant and bullying hicks (not likely far from the truth), but the FBI are revealed to be positively traitorous in their actions surrounding the murder investigation of a Commander in Chief. And I can only assume according to Bugliosi and co., that's A-ok simply because no one ever asked them about it on the record. Also of interest, the film neglects to mention the fact that the FBI and the Secret Service already thwarted an assassination plot on Kennedy's life in Chicago weeks before the trip into hostile Dallas territory (Thomas Arthur Vallee among others was apprehended, an ex-Marine with alleged Communist credentials eerily similar to Oswald). Kennedy Secret Service Man Abraham Bolden wrote a book about it in which he also claims that several members of Kennedy's own Secret Service detail on the Texas trip stated in private they would not take a bullet for Kennedy. All fascinating details (and every bit as relevant as the personal beliefs and claims of Robert Oswald) that have come to light and were left out of Parkland presumably because they detract from the outmoded lone gunman tract.The Oswald family (Marguerite, Robert and Lee) make brief appearances at several stages to help the filmmakers reinforce the official story (official in 1963 anyway) that Oswald was the lone assassin. Marguerite, played here by Jacki Weaver (who was riveting in Animal Kingdom) is the only character crying conspiracy (other than Lee who only hints at it). None of the Oswalds provide a rationale for his actions, only that he is either solely guilty or the victim of something greater. I suppose that's all any of us think today of Lee Harvey Oswald. If you believe the Warren Commission fiction, you must be an anti-conspiracy nut; if you don't buy it, you're just a conspiracy nut. Parkland, the first major film project to put the audience face to face with the President's alleged killer (or patsy) since Gary Oldman in JFK doesn't do much to reconcile these two schools of thought. The scene between Robert and Lee (played adequately by James Badge Dale and Jeremy Strong respectively) excels at showing Lee to be off-kilter and cocky, even in the face of imminent danger, yet it somehow only feels like the intended high point of a low end production.If you want to know what else the Warren Commission purposely didn't ask anyone about (for their own protection), see Stone's JFK. John Kennedy is not an actual character in the film JFK, but his very presence, or ghost, seems to loom over all the events transpiring. It's a testament to how well the film is made, be it fantasy or not. The ghost of John Kennedy is nowhere to be felt in Parkland, despite his dead body being lugged around from one shouting match to another, and his familiar face being shown from time to time on newsreels reminding us that a real person was killed, not just a public figure. There are other real people on display in the film too, but their connection to reality is still highly suspect.",2,a few performances aside...,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,10180,"['film', 'called',

Unfortunately the script is so very flimsy and inept that it makes Parkland Hospital seem like a poor trauma center more interested in the reporters and investigators than on making any particular insights on how the assassination affected hospital personnel. Based on Vincent Bugliosi&#8217;s 1,612-page book &#8216;Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy&#8217; this feels like a hurried film to mark the anniversary of the JFK tragedy.The actors who were evidently making this an attraction at the theaters include Zac Efron (complete with current fashionable 5 o&#8217;clock facial hair that never would have been permitted inside a 1963 accredited hospital). Marcia Gay Harden as the nurse who seems committed to the action, Paul Giamatti as Abraham Zapruder whose clunky movie of the actual assassination ultimately made millions in photo copies, Ron Livingston who was forced to cover important evidence about Lee Harvey Oswald by his FBI boss, Billy Bob Thornton as CIA head, Jacki Weaver as the mentally unbalanced greedy mother of Lee Harvey Oswald, James Badge Dale as Lee&#8217;s brother Robert Oswald (the only realized acting n the movie) and a flock of others.

Kennedy and his wife First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy with Governor of Texas, John Connally and his wife, Nellie, were in the motorcade driving down Elm Street in Dallas, Texas.Meanwhile, Lee Harvey Oswald had set his 6.5 x 52mm Italian Carcano rifle up at the open window upstairs in the Texas School Book Depository.At 12:30am Central Standard Time, Oswald fired his rifle with 3 shots at President Kennedy who was further down on Elm Street. All 3 shots were expertly and quickly done.A bullet hit Governor Connally in the upper right back who was sitting up front with the President in back of him. A bullet hit President Kennedy who had his arms raised with his hands to his face and throat. The bullet hit in the upper back, penetrated his neck and exited out his throat. The third bullet was fatal. It hit the President in the head.An innocent by-stander, Abraham Zapruder, who was using his millimeter film camera, had filmed the motorcade driving on Elm Street and unexpectedly captured the assassination on film.This tragic event happened in front of so many people along Elm Street.The Secret Service quickly reacted and the motorcade rushed to the nearest hospital.This movie is the true story of what happened before, during and after the President was admitted into Parkland Hospital.In the cast: Zac Efron, Marcia Gay Harden, Paul Giamatti, Ron Livingston, David Harbour, James Badge Dale, Billy Bob Thornton, Tom Welling, Colin Hanks, Jackie Earle Haley, Rory Cochrane, Jeremy Strong, Jacki Weaver, Gary Grubbs.Filmed in Dallas and Austin, Texas.While real footage of President Kennedy and others of that day are used in this movie, you will not see the actual assassination in a close-up nor the actual frame at exact second of contact.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[0, 0]","&#34;Parkland&#34; is a recounting of the chaotic events that occurred at Dallas' Parkland Hospital on the day U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The film takes it title from the hospital where both Kennedy and his killer, Lee Harvey Oswald,  were pronounced dead.&#34;Parkland&#34; revisits the assassination of President Kennedy as the tragedy's fiftieth anniversary approaches. Writer-director Peter Landesman provides an up-close-and-personal view of the events in Dallas by following the intertwined stories of several people swept up in the shooting and its aftermath.The President was rushed to Parkland, where a shocked medical team, led by Dr. Jim Carrico, (Zac Efron), desperately tried to revive him long after he was gone. Marcia Gay Harden is the head nurse at the scene. Efron and Harden both give intense portraits of stunned professionals stretched to their limits trying to keep the President Kennedy alive. Blood-spattered Jackie Kennedy sobs nearby.As news of the death shocked the nation, the story rippled outward, following several characters who are peripheral to the tragedy. Overbearing FBI veteran Forrest Sorrels, (Billy Bob Thornton), and his cohorts wrested Zapruder's film from him to have it developed ASAP. Life magazine and other outlets scrambled to purchase rights to the film. Dallas FBI agent James Hosty, (Ron Livingston), realized and agonized over his prior contact with Lee Harvey Oswald, (Jeremy Strong). However, Hosty did not know about Oswald's future macabre' plans in time to to stop him. Then there is the confused scene at the Dallas jail where Oswald was held until he too was assassinated.The film's focus is not on the President, his wife, the newly sworn-in President, Lyndon B. Johnson, or conspiracy theories. Rather  the horror is seen through the eyes of the people who experienced the catastrophic event firsthand on that fateful day in Dallas.  Paul Giamatti masterfully plays Abraham Zapruder, as a man so overwhelmed by the magnitude of the tragedy that it takes him a while to realize what an unintentionally huge role his humble little home movie will play in the unfolding drama. Lee Harvey Oswald, his brother Bob, his mother and wife also have their parts to play here. &#34;Parkland&#34; treats Kennedy as a symbol of hope and optimism, but also, as a fatally injured body, and then as a corpse whose remains must be examined and then transported to a final resting place.Some of the visuals are experienced through expressions on people's faces and gasps of shock, especially the Secret Service detail when they watch the film. Their expressions and grief are gut wrenching. Some of the footage is visible, (but not the &#34;kill-scene,)&#34; through reflections from Zapruder sunglasses. Landesman and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd shoot the action verit&eacute;-style, with a lot of rushed camera movements and reliance on telephoto close-ups. This style of filming enhances the feeling of chaos.Mr. Landesman, a journalist and novelist, adapted the story from Vincent Bugliosi&#8217;s 2008 book, &#8220;Four Days in November,&#8221;As with most other people, I clearly remember where I was when our President,  John F. Kennedy, was murdered. The events of Dallas destroyed a lot of my dreams & my innocence.

1668073,A366S12KCZ280V,B00EO10IEE,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[1, 1]","There have been many movies, TV shows and documentaries made over the years that look back at the tragic events that took place in Dallas Texas in November 1963. One of the better ones to be made is the recent film &#34;Parkland&#34;. Well written, acted and directed &#34;parkland is an interesting look at President Kennedy's assassination because it covers events that usually are not covered or talked about that much on that fateful day that gives a whole new perspective to what occurred. In particular it looks at three individual situations that would be occurring at about the same time. First the film looks at what took place inside the examination room at Parkland Hospital, thus where the title comes from, as the mortally wounded President is wheeled in. It shows what the doctors went through dealing with who the patient was and the severity of the gun shot wound. It would also look at the power struggle that would take place in that examination room between the Secret Service who were still loyal to their slain leader and Dallas government  officials who were insisting the body of JFK was now in their possession because an autopsy needed to be conducted by Dallas law. The Secret Service men on the other hand wanted to get the body of Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy and the now new President Lyndon Johnson out of Dallas and back to Washington D C  as soon as possible for everyones safety and concern. As the movie shows emotions ran very high in that examination room. Later on the movie you watch inside Parkland Hospital again when in the examination room across the hall from where President Kennedy died the doctors struggle to save the life of the man who would be accused of killing the President. These are some of the most intense scenes you will seen in the movie but they are not the only ones.Another intense situation is the look at Abraham Zapruder a business man with a new movie camera who plans to film President and Mrs.Kennedy in their motorcade as they drive by. What would end up happening  however is Mr. Zapruder would capture the moment the fatal shot would hit the President. The story behind that is told here from Zapruder filming that infamous moment to getting the film developed to how Mr. Zapruder was affected by what he witnessed. A lot of people may know of Abraham Zapruder and what he recorded but few probably know of what he went through because of what he recorded.The other interesting story told here is how the family of Lee Harvey Oswald was affected by the actions of Lee Harvey. In particular it looks at Oswald's mother and brother and what they went through and endured all because of what Oswald did and the price they had to pay for those actions.For those of us who are old enough to remember that day, and I am just old enough to remember myself, this movie will bring back the memories. You will find yourself thinking back to what you were doing as all these events take place. For those not old enough to remember or weren't even born yet this movie will prove to be an excellent history lesson. &#34;Parkland&#34; is a must for all to see at least once.

1668085,A20G6UHJZIKVCQ,B00EO10IEE,J. Leery,"[1, 1]","First off, I think the director, Peter Landesman, did an excellent job with this film. Since I was born in the 90's, I never fully understood the importance JFK had on the citizens of the Untied States. I knew he was loved, as most of our presidents are, but the film does an incredible job detailing on the impact it had on the American people.After seeing a movie, I like to read what others thought of it as well and was surprised that many have reviewed this film as &#34;ordinary tale of what happened that day&#34;, that it brings &#34;nothing new to the table&#34; and it's &#34;nothing everyone already knows.&#34;Although these statements might be true to most, it is still a great movie and it most definitely brings something new to the table to everyone who was not alive when this event happened, like myself. Sure the older generations know the story and the details but my generation does not and I believe this film is great for that reason.Although I wish they casted some unknowns to the film, the performances were outstanding and believable. Although whenever Billy Bob Thornton would appear I would see right through his character and just think of the actor which is never good.I think what I liked most of this film was how it did not sway the viewer into believing that Lee Oswald killed or did not kill the president. It put out some theories out there such as his mother stating that he was being framed, there was never a confession, evidence was tampered with, etc. It leaves the viewer with all the information for them to decide them-self whether or not he was to blame.

The acting was excellent from each main character. The hospital scenes were gripping.  I have had people tell me in advance that the camera was too shaky.  Nope, it's just fine.  Other TV shows are much more annoying in that regard.  Since this is shot to feel like you were in the room and in the scenes, the hand held camera work is excellent without being distracting at all.  Kudos to the camera person's, DP and the director.There was no recreation of the assassination, as it's been done before Ad Nauseum and was not need to be done to further the storyline or benefit the film my opinion either. Showing the assassination with a camera locked strictly on Zapruder (that's how the film makers represented the assassination scene) filming with him 8mm camera, well,it was a little awkward as the shot seemed long... but later, using the Zapruder film was a creative idea as the moments of the assassination are reflected into Abraham Zapruder's glasses in a scene where he initially watches what he filmed that fateful day.Many have said that Zack Efron was miscast, I give him credit that his acting worked in the scenes though. I can see why some will say his typecasting was a distraction.  Tom Welling (Smallville) played an excellent role as a secret service agent.None of the actors really got to sink their teeth into this since it was all a fast paced and albeit short film considering the subject matter that COULD have been explored.  No actors spent too much time on screen as it was very paced.Paul Giamatti (Abraham Zapruder) David Harbour (FBI AGENT) and Billy Bob Thorton (SECRET SERVICE) are memorable as you saw different emotional scenes with them. James Badge Dale was excellent as well as Robert Oswald, LHO's brother...The FBI HQ scenes were (for me) very realistic.  The set design/scenery and the overall atmosphere the production team tried to create was real.  The guys smoking, the period clothes and haircuts, it all reminded me of the time. The scenes with Ron Livingston and David Harbor (Agents) were some of the best as they come to grips with the fact that they had LHO in their office just weeks before and could have possibly ""stopped"" the assasination.  I found myself (a big fan of movies) really forgetting about the production requirements (all the behind the scene stuff) and getting into the scenes emotionally.They left out any mention of Governor John Connolly... I found this really wrong and out of place as he was a big part of the story.CAMERAWORKThe film makers avoided spending time or money on many of the key players in this tragic story.  The film was shot quite tight (framed close) probably keep the budget down and the money was surely spent on having the right talent, but it works because it plays better on emotion to do more close ups.  the actors were then forced to provide better facial expressions too.I was totally expecting to see a ""Behind The Scenes"" making of this film.  It's come to be expected and was really expecting some interviews and behind the scenes footage as a documentary. Unfortunately the Blu-Ray does not provide this. There are about 10 'deleted' scenes and a Director Commentary audio setup and subtitles.I must say, that the actors portraying Lee Harvey Oswald (Jeremy Strong) was totally excellent and underused. I wanted to see more scenes that included him. I guess I wanted to see what could have been - a world where Oswald survived to stand trial. The actor portraying him did well for the little time he was onscreen.  And mother Oswald...wow.  If that was really her persona, the actor who portrayed her (Jackie Weaver) really stole the scenes she appeared in.The Blu-Ray is worth buying as the price is very reasonable.",4,"Great Movie, really light - minimal additional disc content",1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,3887,"['Yes', 'be', 'prepared', 'minimal', 'extras', 'disc.OK', 'loved', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'excited', 'pre-order', 'view', 'day', 'was', 'delivered', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'main', 'character', 'hospital', 'scenes', 'were', 'gripping', 'have', 'had', 'people', 'tell', 'advance', 'camera', 'was', 'too', 'shaky', 'Nope', 'just', 'fine', 'Other', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'annoying', 'regard', 'shot', 'feel', 'were', 'room', 'scenes', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'being', 'distracting', 'Kudos', 'camera', 'person', 'DP', 'director.There', 'was', 'recreation', 'assassination', 'been', 'done', 'Ad', 'Nauseum', 'was', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'done', 'further', 'storyline', 'benefit', 'film', 'opinion', 'Showing', 'assassination', 'camera', 'locked', 'strictly', 'Zapruder', 'how', 'film', 'makers', 'represented', 'assassination', 'scene', 'filming', '8mm', 'camera', 'well', 'was', 'little', 'awkward', 'shot', 'seemed', 'long', 'later', 'using', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'was', 'creative', 'idea', 'moments', 'assassination', 'are', 'reflected', 'Abraham', 'Zapruder', 'glasses', 'scene', 'where', 'initially', 'what', 'filmed', 'fateful', 'day.Many', 'have', 'said', 'Zack', 'Efron', 'was', 'miscast', 'give', 'credit', 'acting', 'worked', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'will', 'say', 'typecasting', 'was', 'distraction', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Smallville', 'played', 'excellent', 'role', 'secret', 'service', 'agent.None', 'actors', 'really', 'got', 'sink', 'teeth', 'was', 'fast', 'paced', 'short', 'film', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'actors', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'screen', 'was', 'very', 'paced.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Abraham', 'Zapruder', 'David', 'Harbour', 'FBI', 'AGENT', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'SECRET', 'SERVICE', 'are', 'memorable', 'saw', 'different', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'James', 'Badge', 'Dale', 'was', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'Robert', 'Oswald', 'LHO', 'brother', 'FBI', 'HQ', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'realistic', 'set', 'design/scenery', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'production', 'team', 'tried', 'create', 'was', 'real', 'guys', 'smoking', 'period', 'clothes', 'haircuts', 'reminded', 'time', 'scenes', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'David', 'Harbor', 'Agents', 'were', 'best', 'come', 'grips', 'fact', 'had', 'LHO', 'office', 'just', 'weeks', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'stopped', 'assasination', 'found', 'big', 'fan', 'movies', 'really', 'forgetting', 'production', 'requirements', 'scene', 'stuff', 'getting', 'scenes', 'emotionally.They', 'left', 'out', 'mention', 'Governor', 'John', 'Connolly', 'found', 'really', 'wrong', 'place', 'was', 'big', 'part', 'story.CAMERAWORKThe', 'film', 'makers', 'avoided', 'spending', 'time', 'money', 'many', 'key', 'players', 'tragic', 'story', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'quite', 'tight', 'framed', 'close', 'probably', 'keep', 'budget', 'down', 'money', 'was', 'surely', 'spent', 'having', 'right', 'talent', 'better', 'emotion', 'do', 'more', 'close', 'ups', 'actors', 'were', 'then', 'forced', 'provide', 'better', 'facial', 'expressions', 'too.I', 'was', 'totally', 'expecting', 'see', 'Scenes', 'making', 'film', 'come', 'be', 'expected', 'was', 'really', 'expecting', 'interviews', 'scenes', 'footage', 'documentary', 'Unfortunately', 'Blu-Ray', 'not', 'provide', 'are', '10', ""'deleted"", 'scenes', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'audio', 'setup', 'subtitles.I', 'must', 'say', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'Jeremy', 'Strong', 'was', 'totally', 'excellent', 'underused', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'scenes', 'included', 'guess', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'world', 'where', 'Oswald', 'survived', 'stand', 'trial', 'actor', 'portraying', 'did', 'well', 'little', 'time', 'was', 'onscreen', 'mother', 'Oswald', 'wow', 'was', 'really', 'persona', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Jackie', 'Weaver', 'really', 'stole', 'scenes', 'appeared', 'in.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'worth', 'buying', 'price', 'very', 'reasonable']",N/A
1668090,A26SYWPO0N46R,B00EO10IEE,Juanita,"[0, 0]","I've read almost everything about the JFK assassination there is to read.  I watched Jack Ruby shoot Oswald, live on television when I was in my junior year of high school.  I believe JFK's murder was a public execution, not an assassination and I believe Oswald's shooting was deliberately orchestrated.  I'll go to my grave believing there were additional shooters; the grassy knoll in particular.  The first pictures and video-footage of the assassination rifle was identified as a 7.35 Mauser, not an Italian-made 6.5 Carcano.  I've owned one, and the Carcano is a literal piece of junk.I've watched the 8MM film of Kennedy being hit in the head by a bullet dozens of times - that head-shot came from the front.  His wife crawled onto the trunk of the car immediately following the impact of the bullet.  Why?  She was attempting to retrieve part of his skull - on the trunk of the car.  There was also an alleged bullet hole in the front of Kennedy's throat which was altered, then claimed to be a tracheotomy.  If that hole in Kennedy's throat was a bullet hole, it came from the front.The Pristine Bullet theory and Warren Report were total fiction.  I believe the Warren Commission didn't want the truth published, and my question has always been - why?Although I appreciated the acting, this movie raises a few questions, but offers no answers.  When Officer Tippet was shot, there were spent cartridge cases found at the scene.  Oswald had a revolver, which raises the question, did Oswald stop long enough to eject empty cases from his revolver, or did someone else shoot Tippet with a semi-automatic which ejected the cases onto the street as they were fired?I believe there was indeed a conspiracy to murder Kennedy.  It's true Kennedy's body was immediately removed from Parkland - what was the real reason?  There is speculation that evidence was being removed.  There is also speculation that Kennedy's head wound was ... altered; neither would surprise me.  Nobody was ever brought to justice, for the murder of the President of the United States!

1668091,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,B00EO10IEE,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[11, 12]","'Parkland' is an amazing film, particularly considering it was the creation of a first-time writer-director, Peter Landesman (based on Vincent Bugliosi's book, `Four Days In November';  the size of which nearly rivaled the Affordable Health Care act) and then to be ultimately made on such a small budget and shot in 24 days.  Landesman has said that every American has a version of this movie in their head.  ""Parkland' definitely takes us into the heads of some of the most prominently involved, if not publically known, individuals.I was 20 when President Kennedy was assassinated.  It was America's first brush with a tragedy of this sort playing out on our TV screens instantaneously and for many subsequent days in, for those days, an unprecedented television event, although now an exercise repeated too often for good taste.  America and Americans were much more innocent in that era and technology was limited and somewhat still in its pioneer days.  For the 10 years following the assassination I purchased and read anything printed about the tragedy.  To say I was familiar with the details would be stating it mildly.  Following that decade of close study of the circumstances surrounding Kennedy's death, I moved on with my life.  When new information or re-hashes of old information were in the newspapers, it barely made a blip on my news radar or my emotional scale.  Thus, I did not expect to be affected by 'Parkland' to any great emotional degree.`Parkland', with the cast, the directing, the script, and the sets combined, was able to take me back completely to, not just those three days, but individual minutes of those days; where I was, what I felt, who I was with, and how that weekend unfolded.  The film accomplished this in such an enveloping way that I was shocked at my own reaction.The intent, as stated by Landesman, was to present the story in compressed time and to focus on the doctors who treated President Kennedy and on those individuals in charge of Kennedy's safety, as well as Mr. Zapruder, who I saw in this film as sort of an everyman.  'Parkland' reminds us as well of many aspects of the events that will never be repeated should such a tragedy ever occur in America in the future.  Life has changed, government is very different, society has evolved in a not particularly positive manner, and individuals today are, sadly, not what we were then.  America has changed and it is sad.From the moment you hear the severely traumatized Abraham Zapruder repeatedly screaming, 'they've hilled him', whether you experienced the incident on TV as an adult or whether you barely know who John F. Kennedy is, you are emotionally involved in this awful day and the events which closely followed. 'Parkland', while not glamorizing or exploiting the actual physical details of the assassination, locks us instead inside a very small room where we never were; the Emergency Room of a busy hospital, with rookie doctors, more seasoned nurses, and many, many individuals under extreme duress.  Today there would be at least one newsman and cameraman as a pool media person to document for the public what Americans had not before witnessed.  You see the vision of the very real crushing impact that the loss of 'their man', President Kennedy' had on his Secret Service agents and the feats they accomplished, spurred on by their intense dedication for the very loved, very special  individual under their protection. Zapruder's personal response to the killing of 'his' president is depicted closely and directly symbolizes to the viewer the reaction of regular Americans to such a shocking loss.Each member of the low-waged cast gave us one of their best performances.  Particularly the following three:  Billy Bob Thornton, as Forrest Sorrels, head of the Dallas Secret Service Office, gave a steady, understated, thoroughly believable performance.  He portrayed a man in Sorrel's position perfectly, depicting him professionally doing his job while containing his emotions and yet  managing to fully display his deep feelings simultaneously.  I expected nothing less from Thornton, a brilliant actor who never disappoints and always shows us full blown characters, each perfectly nuanced in every detail, regardless of the size of the role, including, in this instance of Sorrels the small, but impactful, body language, subtly conveying a man suddenly carrying the weight of the world;  Zac Efron thoroughly nailed the young doctor, Charles 'Jim' Carrico, a new E.R. physician who was suddenly and unexpectedly thrust into working desperately to save the most important patient ever to present for his care, a patient who was already unfortunately lost. The strain of the realization of what was happening under his hands was provocatively present on Efron's face, in his eyes, and through his body language; Abraham Zapruder, the only one of these three main characters that most of the public has actually seen, was depicted through the spot-on performance of consummate actor, Paul Giamatti.  Mr. Zapruder was never the same after that day and died at relatively a young age, likely due to the strain of the incident and the impact the loss of President Kenney, whom he so greatly admired. Giamatti never missed a beat in sharing the instant changing impact the tragedy had upon Zapruder at once.  Giamatti's reenactment of Zapruder's plaintive cries immediately following the assassination were utterly and stunningly chilling and a perfect representation by one man of the sound the entire country was vocalizing individually at that very moment.  Marcia Gay Harden and Ron Livingston, as well as every member of the cast, also gave amazingly strong performances for this film.`Parkland' regardless of the constraints under which it was filmed, is a must-see movie.  The fact that it went apparently straight to DVD was a rude surprise and a shame really.  A larger audience should be seeing this film.  I recommend it for every teen and adult in the country, regardless of their age at the time of the event, their political leaning, their interest in history as a broad subject, or of any other factor,

I have researched and followed up information on my own. I have personally scoured the site of the incident personally several times and at different times of year, day/night, and traffic, etc..

For my father's generation, it was the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  For the millennials, it was 9/11.  For many of us boomers, it was the assassination of JFK.  A very young teen at the time, those days left a tremendous impact upon me and helped shaped my life.  The 50th anniversary brought out a spate of new material, which I resisted.  I've already read lots of books, own lots of dvd's on the subject. After so much time, what new could be added?To be honest, I found this film in the Black Friday $1.96 bin at Walmart - otherwise, I would have let it pass me by. Even at that bargain price, I would have let it pass except that it included Paul Giamatti, Marcia Gay Harden and Billy Bob Thornton, among others.  Still skeptical, their presence gave it some gravitas. I finally watched it today and I must say it moved me tremendously.It does use some very familiar footage and news audio, but the film's strength is in the retelling of what happened in those trauma rooms at Parkland, what happened aboard Air Force One, what happened to Abraham Zapruder and what happened to some other players in this drama.  Most of the scenes depicting Parkland Hospital left me in tears - even after all of these years.  President Kennedy was in there for such a short time and until I saw this film, I really never even thought about what that time must have been like.In dealing with the Oswald family, the film used a great deal of kindness and sensitivity.  Even in the weeks after the assassination, Marguerite Oswald seemed as if some screws were loose; the filmmakers did reflect this characterization in their portrayal of her.  However, in the depiction of the the killer's brother, Robert, the filmmakers allow us to feel his pain and resignation.  The depiction of LH Oswald's burial is just as sad and lonely as likely it was.The always excellent Paul Giamatti's portrayal of Abraham Zapruder is particularly a stand-out. All of us Americans who were old enough to understand the meaning of what occurred in those days 50 years ago were thrust into such sadness immediately following the assassination.  For those like Mr. Zapruder who history tapped to play an unwitting part in those days, the burden seemed unbearable.

Just in watching the movie you can tell the director vehemently believes Oswald did it and did it alone and wanted to paint Oswald and his mother particularly as nuts.  Though I understand it was not the director's intent to reenact anything, a movie about the JFK assassination sort of begs of reenactment.  For those of us who have done a lot of research on this subject, you are likely to find some things inaccurate.  Why shoot the assassination on a cloudy day in Dealey Plaza when we all remember the brilliant sunshine?  Rain shortly thereafter with the secret service walking through the plaza?  Nope.  Didn't happen.  Yet in this movie it does happen.  Zap ruder standing by himself on top of the cement block as he filmed the shooting?  No.  His secretary was up on that block right behind him, holding onto him.  But in this movie, he is up there alone and the secretary is down on the grass beside him.  Though I adore Paul Giammati, I did not like his performance of Zapruder.  He was way too emotional and had no accent.  Zapruder, in all the footage of interviews I have seen of him, seemed quite emotionless and subdued with a heavy accent.  You see none of that  here by Giammati.  In the audio commentary the director talks about Oswald as a young 23 year old messed up, worthless kid who beat his wife.  Well, Oswald was 24, not 23.  Worthless and messed up?

This will point to a second shooter placed in front of the car, acting together with Oswald who was firing from  the famous repository building. However, that version may have been ""doctored"" to prove someone's private theory, since another version shows the impact with blood splatter moving vertically.

The movie seemed to capture the kind of &#34;feel&#34; of the 1963. All of us who were alive remember the day, where we were, and how people around us reacted. But this movie gives you an chilling insight into those who were &#34;up close and personal.&#34; For example, the residents and nurses at the hospital have never really had their story told. But I think the film captures what it must have been like to have POTUS come to your ER mortally wounded.I didn't know Lee Harvey Oswald had a brother and wasn't aware of his mother's reactions when he was accused of murdering the President. This was a very human interpretation of the events of November 22, 1963 and what followed. This is not what I'd call an &#34;uplifting&#34; movie, but it is startling in its revelations of what the &#34;real&#34; people around the President and Oswald might have been like.

1668125,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00EO10IEE,M. Oleson,"[0, 1]","Surrounding the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination, a flurry of TV ""specials"" flooded the channels.  This little movie seemed to get lost in the shuffle, which I find unfortunate.  This film takes a fresh look, at least cinematically, at some of the secondary events beginning the morning of the killing to a few days after.  Parkland is the name of the hospital that JFK - and later Lee Harvey Oswald - were taken to after they were shot.  The story goes beyond the events at the hospital however.The film begins the morning of November 22, 1963 in Fort Worth where the Kennedy's had spent the night at the Texas Hotel.  After a couple speeches, Kennedy makes the short flight to Dallas Love Field.  During this time we see the routine of the Parkland staff, the FBI, the Secret Service and Abraham Zapruder (Paul Giamatti).  Zapruder, of course shot the 8 mm film of the motorcade, before, during and after the shots were fired.The medical trauma at Parkland is filled with expected chaos, and frankly is a bit gruesome to watch.  But the filmmakers only show glimpses of JFK and Jackie, keeping a respectful distance.  Zapruder is stunned by the tragedy, Kennedy being a hero of his, but a nearby newsman reminds him of what he has on film.  While we expect the scenes at Parkland to be hectic, I didn't expect it to be the same as Zapruder and the Secret Service race around the city trying to get the film developed.  And then they had to go somewhere else to get copies made.One of the more effective side-stories, and one rarely mentioned, has to do with Oswald's brother Robert (James Badge Dale) and their loony mother, Marguerite (Jacki Weaver).  Back at Parkland, confusion continues as the Dallas County Medical Examiner insists Kennedy's body not be removed in accordance with state law.  The new President Johnson would not leave without Jackie and JFK's body.  Living in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, we were exposed more than most, to numerous anecdotes and stories surround the fateful day and those that followed.  So we are familiar with the story of Oswald's burial.  Having no pall bearers on hand, Robert asked the few reporters/photographers to help move the casket.  I think that's the first time I've seen that in a film or documentary.""Parkland"" sticks with the facts, including some more recently discovered (the FBI awareness of Oswald), and doesn't play loose with conspiracy theories.  It is an excellent dramatic re-creation of those sad days from a somewhat different perspective.The Blu ray transfer is excellent.  It comes in 1080p resolution with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  It includes Spanish and English SDH subtitles.  The video looks great with proper color tones and detail.  Shot digitally with many scenes done with hand-held cameras, the movie still looks film-like.  I saw no digital artifacts.  The audio comes in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  This lossless soundtrack is as good as the video.  The surrounds are often in use but in a natural way.  The confusion and chaos in the hospital for example.  The dialog is very clear and natural.  Extras are minimal.  There is a commentary with director Peter Landesman, some deleted scenes and that's it.  Well, there are some Millennium Entertainment previews.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW) An fine overlooked film of JFK's assassination,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,3255,"['Surrounding', '50th', 'anniversary', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'flurry', 'TV', 'specials', 'flooded', 'channels', 'little', 'movie', 'seemed', 'get', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'find', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'fresh', 'look', 'least', 'cinematically', 'secondary', 'events', 'beginning', 'morning', 'killing', 'few', 'days', 'Parkland', 'name', 'hospital', 'JFK', 'later', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'were', 'taken', 'were', 'shot', 'story', 'events', 'hospital', 'however.The', 'film', 'morning', 'November', '22', '1963', 'Fort', 'Worth', 'where', 'Kennedy', 'had', 'spent', 'night', 'Texas', 'Hotel', 'couple', 'speeches', 'Kennedy', 'short', 'flight', 'Dallas', 'Love', 'Field', 'time', 'see', 'routine', 'Parkland', 'staff', 'FBI', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Abraham', 'Zapruder', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Zapruder', 'course', 'shot', '8', 'mm', 'film', 'motorcade', 'shots', 'were', 'fired.The', 'medical', 'trauma', 'Parkland', 'filled', 'expected', 'chaos', 'frankly', 'bit', 'gruesome', 'watch', 'filmmakers', 'only', 'show', 'glimpses', 'JFK', 'Jackie', 'keeping', 'respectful', 'distance', 'Zapruder', 'stunned', 'tragedy', 'Kennedy', 'being', 'hero', 'nearby', 'newsman', 'what', 'film', 'expect', 'scenes', 'Parkland', 'be', 'hectic', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'same', 'Zapruder', 'Secret', 'Service', 'race', 'city', 'trying', 'get', 'film', 'developed', 'then', 'had', 'go', 'somewhere', 'else', 'get', 'copies', 'made.One', 'more', 'effective', 'side-stories', 'one', 'rarely', 'mentioned', 'do', 'Oswald', 'brother', 'Robert', 'James', 'Badge', 'Dale', 'loony', 'mother', 'Marguerite', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'Back', 'Parkland', 'confusion', 'Dallas', 'County', 'Medical', 'Examiner', 'Kennedy', 'body', 'not', 'be', 'removed', 'accordance', 'state', 'law', 'new', 'President', 'Johnson', 'would', 'not', 'leave', 'Jackie', 'JFK', 'body', 'Living', 'Dallas-Fort', 'Worth', 'area', 'were', 'exposed', 'more', 'most', 'numerous', 'anecdotes', 'stories', 'surround', 'fateful', 'day', 'followed', 'are', 'familiar', 'story', 'Oswald', 'burial', 'Having', 'pall', 'bearers', 'hand', 'Robert', 'asked', 'few', 'reporters/photographers', 'help', 'move', 'casket', 'think', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'documentary', 'Parkland', 'sticks', 'facts', 'including', 'more', 'recently', 'discovered', 'FBI', 'awareness', 'Oswald', ""n't"", 'play', 'loose', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'excellent', 'dramatic', 're-creation', 'sad', 'days', 'somewhat', 'different', 'perspective.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'excellent', '1080p', 'resolution', '1.78:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Spanish', 'English', 'SDH', 'subtitles', 'video', 'great', 'proper', 'color', 'tones', 'detail', 'Shot', 'digitally', 'many', 'scenes', 'done', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'movie', 'still', 'film-like', 'saw', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'audio', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '5.1', 'lossless', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'good', 'video', 'surrounds', 'are', 'often', 'use', 'natural', 'way', 'confusion', 'chaos', 'hospital', 'example', 'dialog', 'very', 'clear', 'natural', 'Extras', 'are', 'minimal', 'commentary', 'director', 'Peter', 'Landesman', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Well', 'are', 'Millennium', 'Entertainment', 'previews']",N/A

Too many stars to mention appear in this movie but, Zac takes away from their performances with his stilted acting. At one point in this movie, he has an exchange with a nurse and you may find yourself laughing at this brief interaction, as it's akin to something out of a B rated soap opera. I think this movie expended a great deal of time on Zapruder (and his demons) and the one nagging question of how much he got from Life magazine for his film is never answered. The overall problem with this film is that it is information we ALL know ALL too well and there wasn't even a hint of anything new to learn. The bloodbath scene in the emergency room would make one think this was another version of the Texas Chainsaw movie as Efron is covered from head to toe in blood. I think the real problem is that they took a sensitive topic, threw a cast together and hoped for the best.Some facts: CBS bid against Life Magazine and lost. Life paid $150,000.00 for the film. Zapruder heirs received $16 million in 1999 from the government for the film. This is not to mention all the other money earned prior to 1999 in licensing fees. I think the Zapruder story is one that would be extremely interesting as it brings up many questions about Zapruder, his film, the funds earned, what the family did with the money and where the film eventually is deposited for future generations to come.",2,"Okay, but, not as good as it could have been:-(",1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,1487,"['placement', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'film', 'act', 'years', 'waste', 'film', 'Too', 'many', 'stars', 'mention', 'appear', 'movie', 'Zac', 'away', 'performances', 'stilted', 'acting', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'exchange', 'nurse', 'may', 'find', 'laughing', 'brief', 'interaction', 'akin', 'something', 'B', 'rated', 'soap', 'opera', 'think', 'movie', 'expended', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'Zapruder', 'demons', 'one', 'nagging', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'got', 'Life', 'magazine', 'film', 'never', 'answered', 'overall', 'problem', 'film', 'information', 'know', 'ALL', 'too', 'well', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'hint', 'anything', 'new', 'learn', 'bloodbath', 'scene', 'emergency', 'room', 'would', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'was', 'version', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'movie', 'Efron', 'covered', 'head', 'toe', 'blood', 'think', 'real', 'problem', 'took', 'sensitive', 'topic', 'threw', 'cast', 'together', 'hoped', 'best.Some', 'facts', 'CBS', 'bid', 'Life', 'Magazine', 'lost', 'Life', 'paid', '150,000.00', 'film', 'Zapruder', 'received', '16', 'million', '1999', 'government', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'other', 'money', 'earned', 'prior', '1999', 'licensing', 'fees', 'think', 'Zapruder', 'story', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'up', 'many', 'questions', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'funds', 'earned', 'what', 'family', 'did', 'money', 'where', 'film', 'eventually', 'deposited', 'future', 'generations', 'come']",N/A

1668138,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00EO10IEE,Paul Allaer,"[95, 104]","""Parkland"" (2013 release; 93 min.) brings the story of the events surrounding John F. Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963. The movie doesn't waste any time and in the initial scenes we get to briefly meet the various players who'd become intimately involved in the events of that day: the Secret Service guys, the FBI guys, the accidental witnesses to the assassination, the doctors and nurses at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and of course the President and his immediate entourage. The initial 15 min. or so of the movie make ample use of the archive footage that exists from JFK's visit to Forth Worth and Dallas. After being shot, the President is taken to Parkland, where a young doctor (played by Zac Efron) at first is overwhelmed with the task at hand, and then gives his all in trying to save the President's life. A couple of major story lines eventually emerge: Abraham Zapruder (played by Paul Giamatti) films the entire sequence of events with his new 8 mm camera, and quickly gets inundated by the media to get that footage; even more interesting for me is the story line involving Robert Oswald, brother of Lee Harvey, dealing with the fall-out of being associated with/family of the killer of the US President.Couple of comments: next month marks the 50th commemoration of JFK's assassination and while we all know pretty much what happens, this movie does shed some interesting perspectives on what happened immediately after the assassination, including at Parkland. Other than the (sporadic) scenes with Zac Efron, Paul Giamatti or Billy Bob Thornton (as the head of the Dallas Secret Service), the cast is made up of unknowns (for me anyway), and that plays out very well as it gives a more authentic feel to the movie. The use of the historic footage adds as well (at some point, one of the TV reporters (Sam Donaldson perhaps?) sums up that fateful day as ""too much, too ugly, and too fast"" and how true that is. It may very well be that America lost its innocence that day.Imagine my surprise when out of the blue and without any pre-release hype or advertising this movie showed up this week at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. I figure this will not play very long and went to see it right away. The screening I saw this at tonight was not very well attended (all of 3 people, including myself), so that is not a good sign, which is a shame as I think this movie deserves an audience. Bottom line: if you are one of those who still is interested in the terrible events that took place in Dallas in late November, 1963, I would encourage you to check out ""Parkland"", be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",4,"Front row seat to US history: ""Too much, too ugly, too fast""",1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,2661,"['Parkland', '2013', 'release', '93', 'min', 'story', 'events', 'surrounding', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'Dallas', 'November', '22', '1963', 'movie', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'initial', 'scenes', 'get', 'briefly', 'meet', 'various', 'players', 'who', ""'d"", 'become', 'intimately', 'involved', 'events', 'day', 'Secret', 'Service', 'guys', 'FBI', 'guys', 'accidental', 'witnesses', 'assassination', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'Parkland', 'Memorial', 'Hospital', 'course', 'President', 'immediate', 'entourage', 'initial', '15', 'min', 'so', 'movie', 'make', 'ample', 'use', 'archive', 'footage', 'JFK', 'visit', 'Forth', 'Worth', 'Dallas', 'being', 'shot', 'President', 'taken', 'Parkland', 'where', 'young', 'doctor', 'played', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'first', 'overwhelmed', 'task', 'hand', 'then', 'trying', 'save', 'President', 'life', 'couple', 'major', 'story', 'lines', 'eventually', 'emerge', 'Abraham', 'Zapruder', 'played', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'films', 'entire', 'sequence', 'events', 'new', '8', 'mm', 'camera', 'quickly', 'inundated', 'media', 'get', 'footage', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'line', 'involving', 'Robert', 'Oswald', 'brother', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'dealing', 'fall-out', 'being', 'associated', 'with/family', 'killer', 'US', 'President.Couple', 'comments', 'next', 'month', '50th', 'commemoration', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'know', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'movie', 'shed', 'interesting', 'perspectives', 'what', 'happened', 'immediately', 'assassination', 'including', 'Parkland', 'Other', 'sporadic', 'scenes', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'head', 'Dallas', 'Secret', 'Service', 'cast', 'made', 'unknowns', 'anyway', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'more', 'authentic', 'feel', 'movie', 'use', 'historic', 'footage', 'as', 'well', 'point', 'one', 'TV', 'reporters', 'Sam', 'Donaldson', 'perhaps', 'sums', 'up', 'fateful', 'day', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'ugly', 'too', 'fast', 'how', 'true', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'America', 'lost', 'innocence', 'day.Imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'blue', 'pre-release', 'hype', 'advertising', 'movie', 'showed', 'up', 'week', 'local', 'art-house', 'theatre', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'figure', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'very', 'long', 'went', 'see', 'right', 'away', 'screening', 'saw', 'tonight', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'attended', '3', 'people', 'including', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'shame', 'think', 'movie', 'audience', 'Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'still', 'interested', 'terrible', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Dallas', 'late', 'November', '1963', 'would', 'encourage', 'check', 'out', 'Parkland', 'be', 'theatre', 'DVD/Blu-ray']",N/A

Was it necessary to portray Robert Oswald as the *exasperated* brother, with a ""what's Lee done now?"" attitude; and Marqueritte Oswald as celebrity seeking Mother? Plus, *some* analysis or opinion of the, shall we say, Parkland papers would have been appropriate. How many professionals on the scene (originally) said that the fatal shot appeared to have come from JFK's front right?Yes, we must be reminded that the proceedings occurred long before the ""single bullet theory"" insult to the American people and the criminally negligent Warren Commission.The film makers seem intent on finding excuses for things like, removing the body from Dallas  > not as a means to obfuscate but as a power play. There are other examples of apparent force-fitting Bugliosi's and (J. Edgar Hoover's) wild scenario.

(Did he know his boys were partying their behinds off, the night before, even leaving a briefcase with the new parade route?).Not to play spoiler but if the 2013 researcher is satisfied hearing three (not four) distinct gunfires at the motorcade; no suggestion of a coffin *and* body bag arrival at Bethesda, then there will be enough reason to buy this movie.Best aspects: some very powerful performances, esp. by ""Zapruder"" and ""Oswald's Brother"".",3,"based upon discredited book, still worth seeing",1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,1909,"['youtube', 'generation', 'interesting', 'dramatization', 'many', 'newsreel', 'clips', 'abundantly', 'accessible.Film', 'runs', '90', 'minutes', 'mostly', 'done', 'hand', 'held', 'camera/documentary', 'style', 'quite', 'well', 'incorporating', 'actual', 'footage.Considering', 'upcoming', '50th', 'commemoration', '11-22-63', 'would', 'expect', 'more', 'certainly', 'more', 'co-Producer', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Was', 'necessary', 'portray', 'Robert', 'Oswald', '*exasperated*', 'brother', 'what', 'Lee', 'done', 'now', 'attitude', 'Marqueritte', 'Oswald', 'celebrity', 'seeking', 'Mother', '*some*', 'analysis', 'opinion', 'shall', 'say', 'Parkland', 'papers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appropriate', 'How', 'many', 'professionals', 'scene', 'originally', 'said', 'fatal', 'shot', 'appeared', 'have', 'come', 'JFK', 'front', 'right', 'Yes', 'must', 'be', 'reminded', 'proceedings', 'occurred', 'long', 'single', 'bullet', 'theory', 'insult', 'American', 'people', 'criminally', 'negligent', 'Warren', 'Commission.The', 'film', 'makers', 'seem', 'intent', 'finding', 'excuses', 'things', 'removing', 'body', 'Dallas', '>', 'not', 'means', 'obfuscate', 'power', 'play', 'are', 'other', 'examples', 'apparent', 'force-fitting', 'Bugliosi', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'wild', 'scenario', 'fairness', 'though', 'Hanks', 'co.', 'have', 'skillfully', 'injected', 'sub-stories', 'very', 'disorganized', 'local', 'FBI', 'office', 'detached', 'agent', 'Hosty', 'who', 'bore', 'extra', 'burden', 'burning', 'Oswald', 'file', 'sometime', '11-24', '>', 'why', 'very', 'angry', 'local', 'head', 'Secret', 'Service', 'who', 'pointed', 'fingers', 'Did', 'know', 'boys', 'were', 'partying', 'behinds', 'night', 'even', 'leaving', 'briefcase', 'new', 'parade', 'route', '.Not', 'play', 'spoiler', '2013', 'researcher', 'satisfied', 'hearing', 'three', 'not', 'four', 'distinct', 'gunfires', 'motorcade', 'suggestion', 'coffin', '*and*', 'body', 'bag', 'arrival', 'Bethesda', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'reason', 'buy', 'movie.Best', 'aspects', 'very', 'powerful', 'performances', 'esp', 'Zapruder', 'Oswald', 'Brother']",N/A

That's why I'm giving it four stars.But I was first disturbed that they misrepresented Oswald's brother's early sentiments.  In real life, Robert told Lee not to trust Ruth Paine during the discussion of friends who could help.  With that in mind, turns out she also knew Allen Dulles.  She got Lee the interview at the depository.  Dulles was on the Warren Commission.  He prevented Paine from volunteering their association during questioning.  Rumor has it she was also kicked off a Nicaraguan Quaker aid group for doing ""espionage related activities"" around the time of Iran-Contra.  That's too creepy to be a coincidence.  I'm not saying she knew why she was asked to friendship the Oswalds if that's what happened, but those unreleased IRS records don't assuage my suspicion.LBJ and Hoover personally asked Earl Warren to pin it on Oswald ""for the good of the country.""  Warren admitted it in his biography.  Same thing they said to Dallas PD in a conference call.  Same ""gonna bring WWIII if you don't"" shtick, all the while LBJ and Hoover are discussing memos about CIA having tracked someone pretending to be Oswald in Mexico City, making calls to a KGB-connected hit man.  Correlate that to Northwoods.  Maybe the mom was right.  Just a crazy old women with an overactive imagination?  No subtlety or objectivity in the portrayal there.  Reminded me of some of the biased depictions in 'The Path to 9/11'.What was truly in the FBI file that Hosty burned?  What was in the Dallas PD initial interview notes that were burned?  Why should anyone take their word for it?  Why dodge those issues completely in the film?  What did Richard Helms mean when he said if Congress kept asking questions he'd have to play hard ball?  He'd just admitted under oath that Oswald was not only a sometime paid informant, but had been pitched for recruitment as a full contract agent.  It's purely coincidence too that the paper trail disappeared as to who pitched him or whether Oswald accepted?  What does Oswald being poor have to do with anything?  Even active GI's don't make glamorous sums of money now, and this was in the 60s.The anniversary is coming up in a month, and much of the information is still classified.  Case closed?  Really?  I'd be happy to trust Tom Hanks regurgitating only the non-controversial portions of Bugliosi's commission apology, but America ought to know about the crazy fundamentalist Christians using churches as fronts during the Cold War to run money, drugs, guns, and assassins over the border.  Child guerrilla soldiers for Jesus, anyone?  Yes, it's unpalatable.  So is the possibility of U.S. HUMINT assets that have been enabled with taxpayer money committing major criminal acts... and that's on the more mainstream end of the possible spectrum.And guess who they put in charge of investigating the - cough - UFO question?  Yep, same funda-Christian nuts playing spy games.  No wonder everything from that to 9/11 has been so mishandled.  Too much garbage.  Too much distortion.

Then reading all the eye witness (credible witness) reports of smelling gun powder as the motorcade moved on after Kennedy was shot.Parkland is a major disappointment and adds nothing to the continuing controversy and is a poor attempt at propaganda.",1,I'd give it a negative 5 but they don't have that option,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,1224,"['Strangely', 'absent', ""'Historical"", 'drama', 'pristine', 'bullet', 'swollen', 'bruised', 'eye', 'LHO', 'Jackies', 'comments', 'when', 'refused', 'take', 'off', 'blood-soaked', 'Chanel', 'suit', 'want', 'see', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Even', 'more', 'profoundly', 'absent', 'LHOs', 'outright', 'was', 'involved', 'killing', 'president', 'National', 'T.V.In', 'fact', 'whole', 'movie', 'seemed', 'deliberate', 'attempt', 'omit', 'anything', 'could', 'seem', ""'controversial"", 'might', 'indicate', ""'conspiracy"", 'include', 'scene', 'FBI', 'agents', 'burnt', 'documents', 'would', 'prove', 'Oswald', 'was', 'guilty', 'attempt', 'save', 'face', 'American', 'public.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'ruled', 'out', 'conspiracy', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'something', 'fishy', 'LHO', 'being', 'defector', 'cold', 'war', 'America', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Commy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'country', 'while', 'thought', 'was', 'possible', 'LHO', 'shot', 'Kennedy', 'part', 'conspiracy', 'reading', 'Mortal', 'Error', 'Then', 'reading', 'eye', 'witness', 'credible', 'witness', 'reports', 'smelling', 'gun', 'powder', 'motorcade', 'moved', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'shot.Parkland', 'major', 'disappointment', 'nothing', 'continuing', 'controversy', 'poor', 'attempt', 'propaganda']",N/A
1668152,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B00EO10IEE,Richard Masloski,"[6, 12]","I had been checking the listings of local theaters looking to find a showing of PARKLAND and instead surprisingly found the DVD of this in a bin at Rite Aid.  Now I know why I found it there instead of at the local movie multiplex.The movie begins by interspersing intros to some of the major players in what is to follow with newsreel footage of the real Kennedy arriving in Texas and riding to death and destiny in Dallas. Then comes the Hollywood stuff with a very poorly done recreation of the moment Paul ""Zapruder"" Giametti enters the pages of history via his Bell & Howell. Despite intercutting footage of the actual goings-on in Dealy Plaza on that day, the only actors in this recreation are those playing Zapruder and his receptionist.  This scene signals the restricted, low-budget seeming style of the rest of the movie - which seems much more of a TV movie than one geared for theatrical release.  Perhaps this is one reason it didn't go far on the big screen.  Anyway, soon after we have Zac Efron as Dr. Charles 'Jim' Carrico.  Zac Efron doesn't look at all like he is from 1963, not with his very contemporary three-day growth.  Couldn't the actor have shaved before the cameras rolled?  Anyway, where in all the scenes at Parkland is Governor Connally?  Where are the doctors voicing any of their findings with regards to the wounds on the President?  The throat wound was thought to be an entry wound by the majority of the doctors at Parkland.  Where in the film is the sudden magic appearance of the magic bullet on the mystery stretcher?  Where is Bobby Kennedy? Where is Jack Ruby? Why is Oswald virtually a phantom throughout the entire film - with one of the best scenes dealing with him amongst the deleted scene extras?  Why does the film lead a viewer to believe it a fact that Oswald wrote a note saying he would blow up the FBI building?  The actual note was destroyed by its recipient, agent James Hosty. Hosty himself later never said that the blowing up of the office was mentioned in the Oswald letter - yet this factoid is presented as fact in the film.  Curiously, if one just came in on the last fifteen minutes or so, the film seems more an ode to Oswald than an homage to Kennedy.  Cross-cutting between the lonely lowering of Oswald's casket accompanied by sombre dirge-like music and Hosty's burning crucial, critical FBI reports on Oswald while hiding out in a bathroom just makes one feel like the Truth about the supposed sniper is being buried and burned simultaneously.  Though based on the book by Warren Report believer Bugliosi, these final scenes seem instead to truly, silently question the Warren Report's rush to judgement.Anyway, as a film about an overwhelmingly seismic moment in American history it is extremely tepid. The only real-seeming moment in the entire dull undertaking is when the Parkland doctors clash with the secret service about the removal of Kennedy's corpse from Parkland to DC. And Jacki Weaver as Oswald's Mom sticks out like a sore thumb while Jeremy Strong as her enigmatic son is the best actor in the movie.  Trouble is, blink and you'll miss him!

I know because I have introduced myself to various members of the media about the very real possibility of me being in the equation. I provided support with documents.Introduced myself as part of the JFK assassination equation with supporting papers that were at the very least compelling enough to print. Did this to make money. The shoe of fortune fit. And I thought riches are/were afoot. I had no emotional interest in who killed JFK. Just financial drive.The lousy Kennedys knew of me at the time of JFK's assassination and let me rot under a police mantel of lies and surveillance with the accompanying telephone company dialogues and show business trash acting on the screen.From these roots the WorldTrdeCenter ashes  rose on 9-1-1 the police emergency telephone number but the country calls it 9/11. How sickening is that?Will see Parkland when it is released to home theater. There will be some kind of reference to me in the film. It is much symbolism and very much subliminal.Voice polygraphs have existed for scores of years. They are better known as voice stress analyzers. They can do a scan on Oswald in the court house. Ruby murders Oswald on network TV- how bogus. The federal government is pathetic.

1668194,AP3B615GM191G,B00EO10IEE,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 4]","When I first saw the trailer for ""Parkland"", I was incredibly excited to see a dramatized version of the events surrounding 11/22/63.  But than, ""thanks"" to some terrible critical reviews, the film didn't even make theaters (only in limited release) and went straight to home video.  In all my years watching movies, there are very few occasions I can say that the critics have been more wrong.For a basic plot summary, ""Parkland"" tells the story of 11/22/63 and the next few days afterwards.  The story is told from a number of different perspectives, including...-The doctors and nurses (Zac Efron, Colin Hanks, Marcia Gay Harden) who worked on both JFK and Lee Harvey Oswald (Jeremy Strong) at Parkland Memorial hospital in Dallas.-Robert Oswald (James Badge Dale) and mother Marguerite (Jacki Weaver) of the supposed killer.-F.B.I. Agent James Hosty (Ron Livingston) who leads the national investigation into the homicide.-Forrest Sorrels (Billy Bob Thornton), the lead Secret Service man on that fateful day.-Abraham Zapruder (Paul Giamatti), the man standing on Dealey Plaza who captured the assassination on his 16mm handheld camera.This movie is filled with drama and palpable tension.  Even though it is just a basic re-telling of the events, those events in and of themselves are enough to carry the weight...nothing contrived is even needed.  Though I know a decent amount about those fateful days anyway, it was fascinating and emotionally-charged to see how all those scenes may have actually played out.The casting/acting is also spectacular.  I can't say that there was one noticeably bad performance in the bunch.  Even an actor like Efron, with a reputation completely different from his type of role here, fits in effortlessly.  Considering this was the directorial debut of Peter Landsman, that is quite a feat.  The film was also produced by Tom Hanks, whose track record on historical fiction is unmatched.I cannot, for the life of me, understand why this film received reviews bad enough to scrap a large theatrical release.  Perhaps it is because it assumes a familiarity with the events it describes.  Had I been completely ignorant of any of those events, the movie moves quickly enough (with only about an hour and a half runtime) that maybe I would have felt a bit overwhelmed.  Other than that, though, this is one that the critics got completely wrong.Overall, ""Parkland"" essentially does for the events of 11/22/63 what ""Flight 93"" did for the events of 9/11.  It takes the historical evidence and shows you what those scenes most likely looked like in actual form.  ""Parkland"" is not biased or preachy...it just sticks to the evidence.",5,"To 11/22/63 What ""Flight 93"" Was To 9/11",1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,2666,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Parkland', 'was', 'incredibly', 'excited', 'see', 'dramatized', 'version', 'events', 'surrounding', '11/22/63', 'thanks', 'terrible', 'critical', 'reviews', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'theaters', 'only', 'limited', 'release', 'went', 'straight', 'home', 'video', 'years', 'watching', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'occasions', 'can', 'say', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Parkland', 'story', '11/22/63', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'afterwards', 'story', 'told', 'number', 'different', 'perspectives', 'including', '-The', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'who', 'worked', 'JFK', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald', 'Jeremy', 'Strong', 'Parkland', 'Memorial', 'hospital', 'Dallas.-Robert', 'Oswald', 'James', 'Badge', 'Dale', 'Marguerite', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'supposed', 'killer.-F.B.I', 'Agent', 'James', 'Hosty', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'who', 'national', 'investigation', 'homicide.-Forrest', 'Sorrels', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'lead', 'Secret', 'Service', 'man', 'fateful', 'day.-Abraham', 'Zapruder', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'man', 'standing', 'Dealey', 'Plaza', 'who', 'captured', 'assassination', '16mm', 'handheld', 'camera.This', 'movie', 'filled', 'drama', 'palpable', 'tension', 'Even', 'just', 'basic', 're-telling', 'events', 'events', 'are', 'enough', 'carry', 'weight', 'nothing', 'contrived', 'even', 'needed', 'know', 'decent', 'amount', 'fateful', 'days', 'anyway', 'was', 'fascinating', 'emotionally-charged', 'see', 'how', 'scenes', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'played', 'out.The', 'casting/acting', 'also', 'spectacular', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'one', 'noticeably', 'bad', 'performance', 'bunch', 'Even', 'actor', 'Efron', 'reputation', 'completely', 'different', 'type', 'role', 'here', 'fits', 'effortlessly', 'Considering', 'was', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Peter', 'Landsman', 'quite', 'feat', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'produced', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'track', 'record', 'historical', 'fiction', 'unmatched.I', 'can', 'not', 'life', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'received', 'reviews', 'bad', 'enough', 'scrap', 'large', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Perhaps', 'familiarity', 'events', 'Had', 'been', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'events', 'movie', 'quickly', 'enough', 'only', 'hour', 'half', 'runtime', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'bit', 'overwhelmed', 'Other', 'though', 'one', 'critics', 'got', 'completely', 'wrong.Overall', 'Parkland', 'essentially', 'events', '11/22/63', 'what', 'Flight', '93', 'did', 'events', '9/11', 'historical', 'evidence', 'what', 'scenes', 'most', 'likely', 'looked', 'actual', 'form', 'Parkland', 'not', 'biased', 'preachy', 'just', 'evidence']",N/A
