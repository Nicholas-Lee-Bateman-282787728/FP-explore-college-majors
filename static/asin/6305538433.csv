It contains many of her old classics, though contrary to the  DVD cover, there are only 13 songs on the hour long DVD.  The concert was  recorded for an HBO special.Pat was not in very good voice at New Haven  that night.  Sounded like she should have warmed up before hand.  She was  weak in the first few songs, having trouble hitting or holding the high  notes.  She got better as things wore on and was herself in the middle.  She again seams to fade towards the end of the concert.  As a  professionally trained singer, she should have known beter than this.  She  was not as strong as she was just this past summer at the outdoor concert  in Albany NY, nearly 20 years later.An enjoyable performance, but not as  good as her studio albums or her other recorded concerts.",3,Not her best concert,945216000,"12 15, 1999",1999,929,"['concert', 'Get', 'Nervous', 'tour', 'height', 'Pat', 'popularity', 'series', 'weak', 'albums', 'eventually', 'drove', 'obscurity', 'many', 'old', 'classics', 'though', 'contrary', 'DVD', 'cover', 'are', 'only', '13', 'songs', 'hour', 'long', 'DVD', 'concert', 'was', 'recorded', 'HBO', 'special.Pat', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'voice', 'New', 'Haven', 'night', 'Sounded', 'should', 'have', 'warmed', 'up', 'hand', 'was', 'weak', 'first', 'few', 'songs', 'having', 'trouble', 'hitting', 'holding', 'high', 'notes', 'got', 'better', 'things', 'wore', 'was', 'middle', 'again', 'seams', 'fade', 'end', 'concert', 'professionally', 'trained', 'singer', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'beter', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'was', 'just', 'past', 'summer', 'outdoor', 'concert', 'Albany', 'NY', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'later.An', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'studio', 'albums', 'other', 'recorded', 'concerts']",N/A

Despite the comments of others, I found the sound quality to be excellent.  Myron Grombacher's pounding drums and his ants-in-the-pants antics are a highlight, as is Neil Giraldo's precision guitar playing - especially the subtle nuances he throws in to round out the band's sound.  Bassist Roger Capp is virtually ignored in this video, while keyboard player Charlie Giordano gets maybe too much time.  Then there is Pat, who looks to be 19 here instead of the 29 that she is, and seems a little bit uncomfortable on stage.  But she and the band put together a solid show, and in the middle of the set string together Looking for a Stranger, I Want Out, and We Live For Love in a powerful rock medley.  The scenes of Pat dancing in front of the drum set alone or with husband Giraldo are a treat.  The audience is literally in the dark, so there is little interaction with them we can see, but camera shots from the stage let us in on how it must look to a performer to sing out to an invisible crowd.

I had a taped copy that I've watched many times, and was delighted to find it released on DVD. The first couple of songs are  weak admittedly, I think they were obligatory &quot;Push latest  release&quot; performances. But then the concert slowly starts to build,  getting better and better. This is a 'real' concert, no overdubs, no  retakes, no self-indulgent solos. Just drums,guitar,bass, piano and the  lady herself. There are a few rough/slow spots, but I can live with that  because its also balanced by those magical moments where the band really  clicks and the music takes off. Thats what rock and roll is.. magic. If  you're more concerned with video/sound quality than with the performance  itself then you may want to pass this one by. My main concern is &quot;Does  it rock?&quot;. If it does then the rest doesn't matter.

468884,A1ULDQ0JVRSG16,6305538433,"JMB ""JMB""","[1, 1]","This dvd could have been so much better if not for a couple of points. First of all, I was annoyed at the way Neil Geraldo kinda looked like a ""greaser"" from the movie, ""Grease."" The only thing he was missing was a package of cigarettes rolled up in his shirt sleeve. I was also kind of annoyed at the way he danced all around the stage with his guitar. I mean, it's good when Angus Young does it, but he's a little guy and it works for him. Not so, with Geraldo. Secondly, ONE GUITAR is not enough for a rock band (although one could argue that point if talking about the band Rush or ZZ TOP). Why did Scott Sheets NOT go on this tour with the band? Every time Geraldo went into playing lead, it left the song sounding rather naked and empty. I kept finding myself asking where is the rhythm? There was a keyboard player but his playing was not enough to keep the songs sounding ""full."" Another thing too is the set list could have been better. I mean, where is ""Treat Me Right"" and the immortal, ""Promises In The Dark,"" or ""Precious Time?"" I could have done without those lame songs from Get Nervous (Anxiety; Shadows of the Night). Otherwise, this would be a five star concert. Pat is the undisputed queen of 80's rock, and it's a shame that this disc doesn't have more to offer. 1980's Benatar concert footage is rather rare. I did buy the DVD-Audio release of ""Pat Benatar - Live From the Front Row"" and the song selection is much better.",5,"Five stars for Pat, personally, but..............",1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,1443,"['dvd', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'couple', 'points', 'First', 'was', 'annoyed', 'way', 'Neil', 'Geraldo', 'kinda', 'looked', 'greaser', 'movie', 'Grease', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'package', 'cigarettes', 'rolled', 'up', 'shirt', 'sleeve', 'was', 'also', 'kind', 'annoyed', 'way', 'danced', 'stage', 'guitar', 'mean', 'good', 'when', 'Angus', 'Young', 'little', 'guy', 'Not', 'so', 'Geraldo', 'Secondly', 'ONE', 'GUITAR', 'not', 'enough', 'rock', 'band', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'point', 'talking', 'band', 'Rush', 'ZZ', 'TOP', 'Why', 'did', 'Scott', 'Sheets', 'NOT', 'go', 'tour', 'band', 'time', 'Geraldo', 'went', 'playing', 'lead', 'left', 'song', 'sounding', 'rather', 'naked', 'empty', 'kept', 'finding', 'asking', 'where', 'rhythm', 'was', 'keyboard', 'player', 'playing', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'keep', 'songs', 'sounding', 'full', 'thing', 'too', 'set', 'list', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'mean', 'where', 'Treat', 'Me', 'Right', 'immortal', 'Promises', 'Dark', 'Precious', 'Time', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'lame', 'songs', 'Get', 'Nervous', 'Anxiety', 'Shadows', 'Night', 'Otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'five', 'star', 'concert', 'Pat', 'undisputed', 'queen', '80', 'rock', 'shame', 'disc', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'offer', '1980', 'Benatar', 'concert', 'footage', 'rather', 'rare', 'did', 'buy', 'DVD-Audio', 'release', 'Pat', 'Benatar', 'Live', 'Front', 'Row', 'song', 'selection', 'much', 'better']",N/A

However, what this TV Special showcases is the magnitude of Benatar's sizzlingly raucous &amp; sweet voice as she strums through megahits up to her Get Nervous multi-platinum album, including grammy-award winning Fire &amp; Ice, as well as Hit Me With Your Best Shot &amp; Heartbreaker.  What is most surprising about this performance, particularly for lesser fans, is that the album trax are the more astounding performances, both tune-wise and vocally.  The title track to Pat's first album In The Heat of The Night is a blindingly electric and sultry hot in the city type trak and the wondrous single Shadows of The Night sends shivers up your back from the opening guitar chords.  Personal faves are the medley I Want Out &amp; We Live For Love, which really wakens the crowd up &amp; a rip -roaring rendition of You Better Run, where Pat brutally warns off an offending lover.  The eloquent rock track Hell Is For Children unveils the force of Benatar's voice and ends of a marvellous tour de force performance which reveals Pat at the top of her game.  It would have been nice to see Little Paradise which was also included on the VHS version of the show or Promises In The Dark, which was included on the Live! cd, Live From Earth.  Nevertheless, with no other live video chronicles available this is all we have to relish of this legend &amp; time allowing, you can still appreciate the savvy &amp; the sheer professionalism which Pat had that have made her the star she is today.
