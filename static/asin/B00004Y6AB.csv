558077,A3BIWTN2DA0YY2,B00004Y6AB,Antoinette Klein,"[1, 1]","Eight of the most famous stars of the day, a warm and tender story, and an uplifting message make this 1944 film a true classic.  David O. Selznick, still riding a crest of popularity after his stunning ""Gone With The Wind,"" borrowed several ideas from that masterpiece.  A long and stirring overture, an intermission in this lengthy three-hour show, and the introduction of a stunning beauty (Jennifer Jones, whom he would later marry) would copy but never equal his previous success, yet this is a magnificent film in its own right as it tells an inspiring story of patriotism, loss, and true love.Claudette Colbert is Anne Hilton.  In the opening scene, she has just taken husband Tim to the train station where he has left to fight in World War II.  Her daughters are Jane (Jennifer Jones) and Bridget (Shirley Temple) and along with their live-in maid and dear friend Fidelia (Hattie McDaniel) they give an impressive view of how the women left behind survived not only the loneliness but also the rationing and social pressures of WWII.Monty Woolley is Col Smollett, the curmudgeon of a boarder they are forced to take in to make ends meet, and Robert Walker, Jr. is Bill, his estranged grandson who falls in love with Jane.  (Interesting trivia:  Walker and Jones were married in real life but in the process of divorcing during this movie since she and Selznick were in love and would later marry.)  Joseph Cotten is Lt. Tony Willett who has a deep affection for Anne and Agnes Moorehead is her embittered friend Emily Hawkins.  Look for Lionel Barrymore as the clergyman and Guy Madison (who would later achieve fame as TV's Wild Bill Hickok) as the lonely sailor in bit parts.Anne must keep her family together and never let their spirits sag as they acutely feel the absence of Tim.  Daughter Jane will survive a great tragedy and their ornery boarder will have his own epiphany.  Keep your hankies handy as you wonder along with the characters if life will ever be the same.Nominated for nine Academy awards (best picture, best actress, best supporting actress, best supporting actor, cinematography, art direction, editing, music score, and special effects)  this is one classic movie lovers will not want to miss.",5,Inspiring Drama Set On The Homefront During WWII,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,2227,"['Eight', 'most', 'famous', 'stars', 'day', 'warm', 'tender', 'story', 'uplifting', 'message', 'make', '1944', 'film', 'true', 'classic', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'still', 'riding', 'crest', 'popularity', 'stunning', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'borrowed', 'several', 'ideas', 'masterpiece', 'long', 'stirring', 'overture', 'intermission', 'lengthy', 'three-hour', 'show', 'introduction', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'whom', 'would', 'later', 'marry', 'would', 'copy', 'never', 'equal', 'previous', 'success', 'yet', 'magnificent', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'inspiring', 'story', 'patriotism', 'loss', 'true', 'love.Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Anne', 'Hilton', 'opening', 'scene', 'just', 'taken', 'husband', 'Tim', 'train', 'station', 'where', 'left', 'fight', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'daughters', 'are', 'Jane', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Bridget', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'live-in', 'maid', 'dear', 'friend', 'Fidelia', 'Hattie', 'McDaniel', 'give', 'impressive', 'view', 'how', 'women', 'left', 'behind', 'survived', 'not', 'only', 'loneliness', 'also', 'rationing', 'social', 'pressures', 'WWII.Monty', 'Woolley', 'Col', 'Smollett', 'curmudgeon', 'boarder', 'are', 'forced', 'take', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'Jr.', 'Bill', 'estranged', 'grandson', 'who', 'love', 'Jane', 'Interesting', 'trivia', 'Walker', 'Jones', 'were', 'married', 'real', 'life', 'process', 'divorcing', 'movie', 'Selznick', 'were', 'love', 'would', 'later', 'marry', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Lt.', 'Tony', 'Willett', 'who', 'deep', 'affection', 'Anne', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'embittered', 'friend', 'Emily', 'Hawkins', 'Look', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'clergyman', 'Guy', 'Madison', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'achieve', 'fame', 'TV', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'lonely', 'sailor', 'bit', 'parts.Anne', 'must', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'never', 'let', 'spirits', 'sag', 'acutely', 'feel', 'absence', 'Tim', 'Daughter', 'Jane', 'will', 'survive', 'great', 'tragedy', 'ornery', 'boarder', 'will', 'have', 'own', 'epiphany', 'Keep', 'hankies', 'handy', 'wonder', 'characters', 'life', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'same.Nominated', 'nine', 'Academy', 'awards', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'actress', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'editing', 'music', 'score', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'classic', 'movie', 'lovers', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'miss']",N/A
558078,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00004Y6AB,Byron Kolln,"[8, 8]","SINCE YOU WENT AWAY (1944) is a beautiful wartime drama about the women left behind, and their contributions to the war effort.  Based on Margaret Buell Wilder's acclaimed novel with a screenplay by David O. Selznick, SINCE YOU WENT AWAY provided Claudette Colbert with her finest performance of the decade, as Anne Hilton, whose husband is away at war but finds excitement and drama thanks to her two adolescent daughters. Jennifer Jones glows as the eldest daughter Jane, with Shirley Temple as the tomboyish Bridget (""Brig"").The film garnered nine Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture, and acting nods to Colbert, Jones and Monty Woolley), but only managed to win `Best Music Scoring' for Max Steiner's stirring compositions.The photography is amazing, whilst remaining within the confines of the simple domesticity the film depicts; but neverthless beautifully cinematic when the occasion calls for it.  The Army Ball, set in an airplane hanger, is perhaps one of the most brilliant sequences ever captured in a film, with Agnes Moorehead leading a conga-line which seems to stretch on forever; and arc-lights illuminating  couples dancing the waltz.Robert Walker plays Jane's (Jennifer Jones) ill-fated sweetheart William Smollett.  In reality, Walker and Jones were married at the time, but Jones ended up divorcing Walker to marry David O. Selznick (her mentor and the man largely responsible for her career) in 1949.  Tragically, Robert Walker died two years later.The strong ensemble cast also includes Hattie McDaniel, Joseph Cotten and Lionel Barrymore.  Selznick managed to coax legendary silent star Alla Nazimova out of retirement for a small but very important role.  This was the Selznick's answer to the successful M-G-M production ""Mrs Miniver"", released two years earlier.  Both films make great companion pieces.The DVD presents the film complete and uncut and (for the first time) with Overture and Intermission/Entr'acte sequences.",4,Colbert in her finest performance of the decade,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,1966,"['SINCE', 'YOU', 'WENT', 'AWAY', '1944', 'beautiful', 'wartime', 'drama', 'women', 'left', 'contributions', 'war', 'effort', 'Based', 'Margaret', 'Buell', 'Wilder', 'acclaimed', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'SINCE', 'YOU', 'WENT', 'AWAY', 'provided', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'finest', 'performance', 'decade', 'Anne', 'Hilton', 'husband', 'away', 'war', 'excitement', 'drama', 'thanks', 'two', 'adolescent', 'daughters', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'glows', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'tomboyish', 'Bridget', 'Brig', '.The', 'film', 'garnered', 'nine', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'acting', 'nods', 'Colbert', 'Jones', 'Monty', 'Woolley', 'only', 'managed', 'win', 'Best', 'Music', 'Scoring', 'Max', 'Steiner', 'stirring', 'compositions.The', 'photography', 'amazing', 'whilst', 'remaining', 'confines', 'simple', 'domesticity', 'film', 'depicts', 'beautifully', 'cinematic', 'when', 'occasion', 'Army', 'Ball', 'set', 'airplane', 'hanger', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'sequences', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'leading', 'conga-line', 'stretch', 'forever', 'arc-lights', 'illuminating', 'couples', 'dancing', 'waltz.Robert', 'Walker', 'Jane', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'ill-fated', 'sweetheart', 'William', 'Smollett', 'reality', 'Walker', 'Jones', 'were', 'married', 'time', 'Jones', 'ended', 'up', 'divorcing', 'Walker', 'marry', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'mentor', 'man', 'largely', 'responsible', 'career', '1949', 'Tragically', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'died', 'two', 'years', 'later.The', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'also', 'Hattie', 'McDaniel', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Selznick', 'managed', 'coax', 'legendary', 'silent', 'star', 'Alla', 'Nazimova', 'retirement', 'small', 'very', 'important', 'role', 'was', 'Selznick', 'answer', 'successful', 'M-G-M', 'production', 'Mrs', 'Miniver', 'released', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'films', 'make', 'great', 'companion', 'pieces.The', 'DVD', 'film', 'complete', 'uncut', 'first', 'time', 'Overture', ""Intermission/Entr'acte"", 'sequences']",N/A

558080,A396SBGKAOLTZE,B00004Y6AB,Chris Aldridge,"[10, 11]","I saw this yesterday on TCM. Yes it is sentimental and patriotic and a bit syrupy in the dialog. But it was released in 1944- meaning it was filmed right in the middle of World War II, so the sentiment and especially the times are aptly reflected. More than anything else, the film's virtues are from the performances. Claudette Colbert reminds me very much of Norma Shearer's matriarch in 'The Women:' warm, intelligent, and very likable, but surrounded by the constrictions and circumstances of the time. (It's interesting to hear her tell Joseph Cotten two hours into the film that she feels useless and is not contributing to the war effort when in fact she's been contributing all along.) Cotten is wonderful as her surrogate mate (still carrying a torch after all these years) and daughters Temple and the beautiful Jones are quite good. There is magnificent b/w cinematography- rich in shadows and geometric patterns, and fine editing which shows off a Norman Rockwell-like presentation of day-to-day life in rural America. The standout scene, of course is Jennifer Jones and Robert Walker (married in real life but separating at the time of the film) parting at the train station. The Steiner score (echoing the chugging of the train) and especially Jones' tearful run after the departing train are especially heartbreaking. (Does she sense her soldier's fate? Note the tragic, almost psychic expression on her face as she reads the engraving on the watch.) Good performances also from Agnes Moorehead and Selznick veteran Hattie McDaniel.

558082,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00004Y6AB,C. Middleton,"[2, 2]","This is the first film I've ever seen that begins with a 10 minute `Overture'; the music is excellent and won the composer, Max Steiner, the 1945 Oscar for Best Music. The film was nominated for 9 Oscars, directed by John Cromwell, (The Enchanted Cottage) and written & produced by the man himself, David O. Selznick. Selznick evidently intended this film to reach the box office and epic movie success of `Gone with the Wind', however popular at the time and now considered one of the top twenty 40's films ever made, never reached Selznick's expectations.The film follows the lives of the Hunter family after Mr. Hunter leaves to go and fight in the war. Claudette Colbert in the role of Mrs. Hunter carries the film throughout the three hours but is well supported by the Hunter girls', Jane (The beautiful Jennifer Jones) and Brig (An older Shirley Temple) including a close friend of the family, Anthony Willett (Joseph Cotton).What makes this film unique for its time is its perspective of the wives and children left behind as husbands, fathers and sons went to war.The DVD not only includes an `Overture"" but an actual Intermission, where the beautiful soundtrack continues to play in the background.The clergyman played by the regal Lionel Barrymore gives a sermon in a moving monologue representing America's Ideals of preserving liberty. Barrymore is a legend and this short speech in the film affirms this legendary status.Personally, my favourite character is the irascible Colonel Smollet (Monty Woolly) as his character is the type one never sees anymore, old-worldly, traditional, strong, and a man of principles.For some of us living in the 21st century this film may appear too sentimental and possibly `corny', but it represents America's high values: the importance of family and strength of character during war time. Values that continue to be important today as our boy's continue to leave their homes and families to fight (in most cases) senseless wars.We forget that those left behind, particularly the women, fought hard to even survive and supported their respective families and the war effort in ways that should be acknowledged more than it currently is or in the past.I like this film because the themes and values it represents are very important and should never be forgotten.A certain 5 stars...",5,Top Twenty  40's Film & a Beauty...,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,2330,"['first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', '10', 'minute', 'Overture', 'music', 'excellent', 'won', 'composer', 'Max', 'Steiner', '1945', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Music', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', '9', 'Oscars', 'directed', 'John', 'Cromwell', 'Enchanted', 'Cottage', 'written', 'produced', 'man', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'Selznick', 'evidently', 'intended', 'film', 'reach', 'box', 'office', 'epic', 'movie', 'success', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'however', 'popular', 'time', 'now', 'considered', 'one', 'top', 'twenty', '40', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'never', 'reached', 'Selznick', 'expectations.The', 'film', 'lives', 'Hunter', 'family', 'Mr.', 'Hunter', 'go', 'fight', 'war', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Hunter', 'film', 'three', 'hours', 'well', 'supported', 'Hunter', 'girls', 'Jane', 'beautiful', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Brig', 'older', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'including', 'close', 'friend', 'family', 'Anthony', 'Willett', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'film', 'unique', 'time', 'perspective', 'wives', 'children', 'left', 'behind', 'husbands', 'fathers', 'sons', 'went', 'war.The', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'Overture', 'actual', 'Intermission', 'where', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'play', 'background.The', 'clergyman', 'played', 'regal', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'sermon', 'moving', 'monologue', 'representing', 'America', 'Ideals', 'preserving', 'liberty', 'Barrymore', 'legend', 'short', 'speech', 'film', 'legendary', 'status.Personally', 'favourite', 'character', 'irascible', 'Colonel', 'Smollet', 'Monty', 'Woolly', 'character', 'type', 'one', 'never', 'anymore', 'old-worldly', 'traditional', 'strong', 'man', 'principles.For', 'living', '21st', 'century', 'film', 'may', 'appear', 'too', 'sentimental', 'possibly', 'corny', 'America', 'high', 'values', 'importance', 'family', 'strength', 'character', 'war', 'time', 'Values', 'continue', 'be', 'important', 'today', 'boy', 'continue', 'leave', 'homes', 'families', 'fight', 'most', 'cases', 'senseless', 'wars.We', 'forget', 'left', 'particularly', 'women', 'fought', 'hard', 'even', 'survive', 'supported', 'respective', 'families', 'war', 'effort', 'ways', 'should', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'more', 'currently', 'past.I', 'film', 'themes', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten.A', 'certain', '5', 'stars']",N/A

It's premise is so simple that it can be described as the trials and tribulations of the families left behind when the men went off to war in uncertain times and how people adapted to the changing scene at home that seemed to be in constant flux.The story centers around the Hilton family.The father goes off to war while the mother Anne (Claudette Colbert) and her daughters Jane(Jennifer Jones) and Bridget (a teenaged Shirley Temple) deal with the loss of the husband and all the social and economic changes that are brought about by the war. The family regroups on a lot of levels and evolves as they face their own homefront challenges. As the story progresses, the viewer sees an already pretty nice family doing what they can to support the war effort and as a result becoming even better people.While melodramatic and sentimental, it manages to do a lot to convey the feelings of many americans regarding WWII. I fell into the premise of this movie easily because my grandparents talked a lot about the changes they experienced and society as a whole experienced. The cast was really good and very convincing. I particularly liked Joseph Cotten,Robert Walker, Colbert, and Jones in their lead roles while the supporting actors such as Fanny McDaniels, Agnes Moorehead, Nazimova, Keenan Wynn, and Monty Wooley rounded out the casting in their support.This was a movie that echoed the era and came across as a cross between pictures by Norman Rockwell and Currier and Ives.",5,Kind Of Weepy And Wonderful,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,1637,"['was', ""n't"", 'around', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'suspect', '3', 'hour', 'mega', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'viewed', 'love', 'letter', 'stoic', 'folks', 'home', 'WWII', 'premise', 'so', 'simple', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'families', 'left', 'behind', 'when', 'men', 'went', 'war', 'uncertain', 'times', 'how', 'people', 'adapted', 'changing', 'scene', 'home', 'seemed', 'be', 'constant', 'flux.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Hilton', 'family.The', 'father', 'war', 'mother', 'Anne', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'daughters', 'Jane', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Bridget', 'teenaged', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'deal', 'loss', 'husband', 'social', 'economic', 'changes', 'are', 'brought', 'war', 'family', 'lot', 'levels', 'evolves', 'face', 'own', 'homefront', 'challenges', 'story', 'viewer', 'already', 'pretty', 'nice', 'family', 'doing', 'what', 'can', 'support', 'war', 'effort', 'result', 'becoming', 'even', 'better', 'people.While', 'melodramatic', 'sentimental', 'do', 'lot', 'convey', 'feelings', 'many', 'americans', 'regarding', 'WWII', 'fell', 'premise', 'movie', 'easily', 'grandparents', 'talked', 'lot', 'changes', 'experienced', 'society', 'whole', 'experienced', 'cast', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'very', 'convincing', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'Colbert', 'Jones', 'lead', 'roles', 'supporting', 'actors', 'such', 'Fanny', 'McDaniels', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'Nazimova', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Monty', 'Wooley', 'rounded', 'out', 'casting', 'support.This', 'was', 'movie', 'echoed', 'era', 'came', 'cross', 'pictures', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'Currier', 'Ives']",N/A

That's the good news, at least for most male viewers, because the bad news- again, for us males -  is that this is a woman's movie from start-to-finish.  For you ladies, this movie is gold!From the moment Claudette Colbert comes home after seeing her husband off for war, the tears start and the women's soap opera begins. It goes on and on, too, because this film is almost three hours long. That is a lot of time for a lot of heartaches. How many hankies is that? It has to be the whole Kleenex box!I'm not making fun of it. The topic - women seeing their men off to war and never knowing if they'll come back alive - has been a tragic one since mankind began.The cast in here was astonishing with people such as Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotten, Guy Madison, Shirley Temple, Monty Whooley, Hattie McDaniel, Agnes Moorhead, Craig Stevens, Keenan Wynn, Robert Walker and Lionel Barrymore.I found no fault with any of them expect perhaps Temple, whose young-adult roles never matched her little girl performances, except for ""The Bachelor and The Bobbysoxer.""It was interesting to see a young Stevens, who 15 years later starred in television's ""Peter Gunn"" series. It also was a bit odd seeing Jones and Walker together because they got divorced in 1944, the same year this movie was released. This must have been awkward for them to film since they obviously were not doing well in their real-life marriage.This movie isn't all tears. There are some genuinely warm moments in here, including a very nice Christmas scene. People generations ago were more hopeful and optimistic, too. Today's world is much more cynical, so this film makes some critics unhappy because they think the people are too goody-goody. Well, too bad for them. For me, that's part of the charm of classic era movies: nicer attitudes.The photography was pretty good, too. There are lots of lights-and-shadows. Is the too long and should it have been edited?

558088,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00004Y6AB,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Two things still stand out in this elongated, patriotic 1944 soap opera produced in immaculate style by David O. Selznick (Gone with the Wind,Rebecca) - the natural, self-effacing warmth of Claudette Colbert's portrayal of a WWII wife and mother holding down her home as her husband goes off to war, and the striking black-and-white cinematography by Lee Garmes and Stanley Cortez, who use a lot of deep focus and long shadows to accentuate the more dramatic moments. Look at the dance sequence in the airplane hangar or the departing train scene for clear evidence of their artistry. Otherwise, the film directed by John Cromwell is emblematic of its time as a morale booster to war-weary audiences looking for ways to cope with the eternal wait for the serving men. Based on a novel by Margaret Buell Wilder written in the form of a series of letters, Selznick took it upon himself to flesh out the story into a full-fledged screenplay with the intent of making an American version of the 1942 MGM classic,Mrs. Minivercomplete with an overly effusive musical score by Max Steiner. While some jingoism is expected from a film of this era, it remains a poignant piece of Americana during a more innocent time - not as emotionally resonant as William Wyler'sThe Best Years of Our Livesbut cut from the same dramatic cloth.The simple story focuses on the Hilton family. Head of the household Tim (who is only seen in the movie in photos) has just left, and his wife Anne is trying to cope with the initial loneliness. Oldest daughter Jane is a boy-crazy high school senior, and fifteen-year-old Brig is the perky rabble-rouser-wannabe. Devoted to Tim with unconditional devotion, the three have an ideal relationship. Because they have to now survive only on his allotment checks, Anne has to let family maid Fidelia go, even though she comes back to work for them for free. Such situations obviously just happen in the movies. They take in a boarder, the easily irritable Colonel Smollett, and things get complicated when family friend Lt. Tony Willett shows up. Jane develops a crush on Tony, but her affections quickly transfer to Smollett's grandson Billy, a puppyish enlistee who is summarily ignored by his grandfather for getting ejected from West Point. The film starts to move into a quagmire of tear-jerking scenes at this point, and the last part introduces new situations and characters  much too quickly - including a potentially interesting episode on Anne's job in a steel mill - before the film finally ends.Colbert is wonderful as the patient Anne from start to finish. As Jane, Jennifer Jones tries too hard to be youthful at the beginning (she was 25) but settles down when her character falls in love with Billy and matures due to an unexpected tragedy. In a role virtually identical to the one he played in Vincente Minnelli'sThe Clockopposite Judy Garland, Robert Walker overdoes Billy's callowness to an off-putting degree. Regardless, I have to admit his scenes with Jones are touching, especially the famous goodbye scene at the train platform (satirized hilariously inAirplane!). Appearing about four years after the last of her child roles, Shirley Temple transitions nicely into adolescence as the spirited Brig. As the dashing Tony, Joseph Cotten is not particularly challenged here since he seems to be replaying Uncle Charlie from Alfred Hitchcock'sShadow of a Doubtwith none of the darkness. The same can be said about Monty Woolley as Smollett, Hattie McDaniel as the comically inappropriate Fidelia (whose musical accompaniment sounds patronizingly like a cotton plantation spiritual), and even Agnes Moorehead playing Anne's narrow-minded society friend. Silent screen actress Nazimova shows up near the end as Anne's sanctimonious Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; co-worker.

Claudette Colbert portrays Ann Hilton, the courageous mother of two daughters: sensitive, romantic Jennifer Jones and her earthy, likeable sister, Shirley Temple. Throughout the movie, you see how they try to cope in an America of the 40s with World War II raging and Mr. Hilton has gone off to fight the enemy. The Gone-With-the-Wind long length sparkles with numerous great turns by Hollywood's greatest: Hattie McDaniel as Vadelia, the legendary Nazimova as a Russian emigrant,Agnes Morehead as the vicious, shallow hypocrite (a role she mastered in), etc. Selznick later wished he had filmed this classic in color. But the ravishing photography shimmers in its luscious black and white. Shadows galore, great crane shots, windows always sparkling from rain or gleaming with snow. A fascinating, poignant look at a long-ago America during World War II, where hearths always crackled invitingly, families sat around playing cards for fun (no TV yet) and Western Union could deliver news that horrified or give one hope. The final scene of the Hilton women, gathered close together as they read that fateful telegram is unforgettable. Selznick wanted this movie to outdo his mythical masterpiece, &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot; Of course it didn't. There's only one GWTW but &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; certainly played to tens of millions of movie goers during the 40s (it's listed as one of Hollwood's all-time highest grossing movies)and once you've seen it, you'll never forget Ann Hilton and Daughters as they struggle to keep the homefront strong. By the way, the unlucky unknown actor playing Mr. Hilton had all of his scenes cut out and you only see him briefly as a framed photograph.I've written much about David Selznick in my book on old Hollywood, &quot;The Kiss of King Kong.&quot;",5,Oldie-Goldie Masterpiece!,978912000,"01 8, 2001",2001,2041,"['great', 'l944', 'movie', 'David', 'Selznick', 'quot', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'quot', 'watch', 'holidays', 'especially', 'snowy', 'afternoon', 'best', 'scenes', 'classic', 'occur', 'wintry', 'backdrop', 'Christmas', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Ann', 'Hilton', 'courageous', 'mother', 'two', 'daughters', 'sensitive', 'romantic', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'earthy', 'likeable', 'sister', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'try', 'cope', 'America', '40s', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'raging', 'Mr.', 'Hilton', 'gone', 'off', 'fight', 'enemy', 'Gone-With-the-Wind', 'long', 'length', 'sparkles', 'numerous', 'great', 'turns', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'Hattie', 'McDaniel', 'Vadelia', 'legendary', 'Nazimova', 'Russian', 'emigrant', 'Agnes', 'Morehead', 'vicious', 'shallow', 'hypocrite', 'role', 'mastered', 'etc', 'Selznick', 'later', 'wished', 'had', 'filmed', 'classic', 'color', 'ravishing', 'photography', 'shimmers', 'luscious', 'black', 'white', 'Shadows', 'galore', 'great', 'crane', 'shots', 'windows', 'always', 'sparkling', 'rain', 'gleaming', 'snow', 'fascinating', 'poignant', 'look', 'long-ago', 'America', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'where', 'hearths', 'always', 'crackled', 'invitingly', 'families', 'sat', 'playing', 'cards', 'fun', 'TV', 'yet', 'Western', 'Union', 'could', 'deliver', 'news', 'horrified', 'give', 'one', 'hope', 'final', 'scene', 'Hilton', 'women', 'gathered', 'close', 'together', 'read', 'fateful', 'telegram', 'unforgettable', 'Selznick', 'wanted', 'movie', 'outdo', 'mythical', 'masterpiece', 'quot', 'Gone', 'Wind.', 'quot', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'GWTW', 'quot', 'Went', 'Away', 'quot', 'certainly', 'played', 'tens', 'millions', 'movie', 'goers', '40s', 'listed', 'one', 'Hollwood', 'all-time', 'highest', 'grossing', 'movies', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'Ann', 'Hilton', 'Daughters', 'struggle', 'keep', 'homefront', 'strong', 'way', 'unlucky', 'unknown', 'actor', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Hilton', 'had', 'scenes', 'cut', 'out', 'only', 'see', 'briefly', 'framed', 'photograph.I', ""'ve"", 'written', 'much', 'David', 'Selznick', 'book', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'Kiss', 'King', 'Kong.', 'quot']",N/A

It provides an accurate time capsule of the time in which it was made, and I know, because I was on the planet then and my dad was serving in the U.S. Army.  One facet of the story that is seldom noted is that the family's black housekeeper, maid and surrogate mother to the entire family, has to be let go because the budget can't afford her salary.  She goes to work for a wealthy family in town and makes more money but comes back to the home she lived and worked in so long because she misses the family, she misses her room, and she misses the feeling of being home and belonging.  The answer from Claudette Colbert: Your room was always your room, your room is still your room and if you want to come back come back and I could never take your money.  So she comes back and it is very clear from the film she is not stuck in her beloved room but is a part of family life as she always was.  This is a powerful message but delivered so effectively it is seldom commented on.

The way Ann and her daughters feel about the husband and father.  It must be like heaven on earth, to be loved so much.  One of the scenes that I like so much, is when Joseph Cotton (Uncle Tony) shows them the poster he made an encruting poster for the Waves!  It's Ann and he has her showing a lot of leg.  And though of course he really is'nt, says he was surprised they turned it down and then they shipped him out. As for Monty Wooley he as always is great.  Jane and Bridget become like granddaughter to him, and Ann no doubt like a daughter. When she gets that telegram informing that her husband Tim is missing in action, well it really gets to one's heart.  The aftermath, showing their reaction to the news, well just reread the sentence about being loved so much.  What a jem of a husband and father he must be.  Also I like the way Hattie McDonnel as the maid(too bad that prejudice at the time prevented her from having the career she deserved) is treated by the family.  They don't talk down to her, and she is treated with true love yet that and respect.  At Jane's graduration, she is invited and sits with the family. Even if Tim was there, she would still be invited and still be sitting with the family.  The only reason not after all, is that they are allowed only so many tickets for the students to give for family and friends to attend.  And when Ann finds out that the young boy Jonney is killed very soon after talking to them, you feel such sadness too.  And at the end when after she opens the gift that Tim had brought for her, well a person would have to have a heart of stone, not to be moved just a little.  She receivies a phone call informing her that Tim is alive and well.  A person who does'nt have a heart of stone, can't help but be moved.  I recommend this movie to others.

She was right!  Her career never again reached the heights it had once hit regularly.No matter, she gave a great performance and showed what an ordinary American woman can do in time of war.  The ironic thing is that Colbert was French herself, which makes her conversation with Alla Nazimova towards the end of the movie even more bizarre (the one about ""You are America to me, Mrs. Hilton."")The movie itself is super-long and sometimes contrived but for the most part it is one of the greatest spectacles of US cinema.  Just the lighting in the big canteen dance is enough to make your eyes bug out of your head.  The hundreds of extras doing the jitterbug--and then hearing the sound of the planes propelling the boys away to an uncertain destination.  And of course the sequence where Jane and Bill have to part and she goes running after his train, crying and trying not to hit any pillars, is a famous tearjerker.  And how sexy is the day when Jane and Bill go out to the country and get caught in the rain and the barn and the straw--it's better than THE OUTLAW!Because the movie employed so many gay stars (not Jennifer Jones or Shirley Temple) it has a strange kind of artificial glamor to it that gives you pause, as do so many of the films of John Cromwell.  Agnes Moorehead is completely free of vanity in this movie, she says and does things that any other actress would have balked at.  Haver said that people threw things at her on the street after this film came out, she gave such an unsparing portrait of a selfish hoarder and sex maniac.Guy Madison looks fantastic and he's really a golden boy in this movie, making Robert Walker look absolutely po-faced in comparison.  Seems like I saw Rhonda Fleming, too, at the dance sequence--could she really be in this film?  I don't know if she was contracted to Selznick or not.Did you know that, in typical DOS fashion, producer Selznick pressured each one of his leads to sign some version of this statement (and used them in publicity)-- ""'Since You Went Away' is the finest picture in which I've ever appeared'""?

558108,A3NLJZI5NEOT0K,B00004Y6AB,"Linda Pagliuco ""katknit""","[1, 1]","WWII was still raging, and producer David O. Selznick wanted to make a film, not about the fighting, but about the American home front. Margaret Buell Wilder had published a collection of her letters to her soldier husband, and Selznick took it upon himself to adapt it into a screen play for one of his trademark ""blockbusters.""  Since You Went Away never reached the heights of Selznick's Gone With the Wind, but with an all star cast, great direction (John Cromwell), and top notch cinematography (Stanley Cortez and Lee Garmes), it captured the attention of a populace coping with the deprivations of wartime.  Claudette Colbert played housewife Ann Hilton, who struggles to maintain a normal home environment for her daughters Jane (Jennifer Jones) and Bridget (Shirley Temple). This family is financially secure, but must still deal with shortages, rationing, separations, returning wounded, and constant anxiety and worry. Ann is supported by her housekeeper, Fidelia (Hattie McDaniel, Mammy in GWTW), and family friend Lt. Tony Willett (Joseph Cotten) who loves Ann, but chastely.  There's an awful lot of gee whiz sincerity in this story, which is relieved now and then by Agnes Morehead as a catty society matron. Morehead wen[...]t on to play many crone types, but as seen here, she was quite a lovely woman. Guess that's why they call it acting.Since You Went Away contains many dated elements (the musical score, which won an Oscar, is positively saccharine, as is some of the dialogue), but nevertheless it works. The granddaddy of all subsequent train station parting scenes is touchingly enacted by Jennifer Jones and her fiance (Robert Walker), who is shipping out to the European front. In a bit of interesting trivia, Jones and Walker were married in real life and were in the midst of a tense separation.

558112,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,B00004Y6AB,Nix Pix,"[5, 7]","""Since You Went Away"" is David O. Selznick feeble attempt to turn a simple war time melodrama in a contemporary ""Gone With The Wind."" Running just under three-hours - and with enough tear-jerking moments to stock up three films, this cry-fest extraordinaire was meant to be a sincere tribute to all the families who stayed behind while their men went off to fight in World War II. Claudette Colbert stars as Mrs. Anne Hilton, the dutiful wife and mother of two evangelic daughters, Deborah (surprise, surprise - Jennifer Jones) and Briget (Shirley Temple - all grown up and not nearly as effective as during her childhood tenure at Fox). Selznick's screenplay concocts Anne as the veritable to0-good-to-be-true model of courage and strength on the home front. However, after the first hour or so, charting the family's day-to-day life and struggles get to wear a bit thin on the mind and heart.In retrospect the doomed romance between Deborah and departing serviceman, William Smollett (Robert Walker) seems foreshadowing to the end of Walker and Jones marriage in real life. Guy Madison - a Selznick `discovery' whom the producer hoped would pay off in the same way as his earlier finds, failed to catch on, though in this film he is particularly used to good effect as the all American fighting boy in blue. Despite its shortcomings, ""Since You Went Away"" was a resounding box office success when it was released and was nominated for a truck-load of Oscars. But the tide of favorable preference in Academy voters had begun to turn against Selznick films by this time. ""Since You Went Away"" took only one statuette home for its moody and evocative black-and-white cinematography.MGM's DVD is rather impressive. The B&W; picture exhibits a very nicely balanced gray scale with smooth, solid blacks and very clean whites. Age related artifacts are present throughout but do not distract. Some minor edge enhancement crops up but pixelization is kept to a minimum. Overall the picture will surely not disappoint. The audio is mono but more than adequate for a film of this vintage.

The British had scored a big hit in 1942 with ""Mrs. Miniver"" which won numerous Academy Awards. Producer David Selznick wanted to make a film that depicted an American family and their struggles during this difficult time. ""Since You Went Away"" was the result. It deals with a Midwestern mother and her two teenage daughters and how their lives are affected when the husband and father is sent to war.Claudette Colbert plays the mother (she first balked at playing a mother to two teenagers) and she is very good if a tad refined for a housewife. Jennifer Jones and Shirley Temple play the daughters and rounding out the all star cast is Joseph Cotten, Monty Woolley, Robert Walker, Agnes Moorehead, Hattie McDaniel, Nazimova, Lionel Barrymore and Guy Madison. And if you look quick, you will see Dorothy Dandridge in the dance scene.As with most David O. Selznick features, the film is padded perhaps too much (it runs for almost 3 hours) and is heavy on the sentiment. However, the film is very entertaining and there are numerous memorable scenes. The most famous is a touching farewell sequence at a train station as Jane (Jennifer Jones) says goodbye to her boyfriend (Robert Walker). What is ironic about that scene is that in real life, Jones and Walker were married but were in the midst of a separation. A definate tear-jerking moment as is the last scene with Colbert sitting at the Christmas tree alone on Christmas eve.The film looks fantastic on this new MGM dvd release.

Frankly, I had not heard of it before and that surprized me because it is a good movie and, I believe, an important one.  It gives a wide view of life on the home front during WWII. We see it through the eyes of a middle to upper-middle class household of a middle-aged woman and her two teen-age daughters.  The husband/father enlisted, patriotically, and the family then has to face life without the patriarch for an indefinite period of time.  We see the small crises and the big ones; some bigger than we wanted to see.  We also see how different people handle the stress and challenges of the war on the homefront.The acting is very good with a lot of well-known names; Monty Woolley, Claudet Colbert, Jennifer Jones, Shirley Temple, Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Lionel Barrymore, Robert Walker, and Hattie McDaniel.  There are also a few up and comers that you may or may not recognize.  Claudet Colbert is the unquestionable star of the movie but my choice as the next best is Monty Woolley who is his usual aloof self but with a heart that makes a few cameo appearances.  The one character who I found out of place is the the role played by Joseph Cotton.  The role was too loosely defined and he seemed to interrupt rather than enhance the flow of the movie.  My other negative comment is that the movie was about 30 minutes too long.  There was plenty of room for a better film editing job.

558124,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B00004Y6AB,Simon Davis,"[69, 70]","Peerless is how I would describe David O. Selznick's beautiful  1944 tribute to the stength and fortitude of those family members fighting the ""other war"", on the home front while their men were away on active duty overseas. ""Since You Went Away"", covers this topic in a sensitive, emotionally charged and at times quite stark manner that never fails to move and touch me with its beautiful writing, flawless acting performances and quite simple message of pulling together in times of need for the better good of all.Planned as David O. Selznick's followup to the classic ""Gone With The Wind"", ""Since You Went Away"" had in common with that film the theme of the effect that war has on a family and everything that it values. Despite it's epic size the film surprisingly focuses on a small close knit family unit headed by Anne Hilton(Claudette Colbert in an unforgettable performance), and takes us through the course of one year in the lives of Anne and her two daughters Jane (Jennifer Jones) and Bridget (Brig), (Shirley Temple in her teenage comeback performance). Much is changed and altered forever in their existence through the trials and tribulations inflicted by the war. We see Anne having to find the inner strength  to cope with keeping her family together and operating as normal without her husband beside her, while still experiencing the fear and concern for him while he is in constant danger. The financial situation forces Anne to take in a stranger as a source of much needed income and gruff Colonel Smollett (Monty Woolley), joins the household and unknowingly ignites a romance between Jane and his estranged grandson Bill (Robert Walker). As for most families in World War Two the year is an eventful one for good and bad reasons for Anne and her children as  they experience the usual shortages and rationing and then receive the dreaded telegram informing Anne that her husband is missing in action. Jane experiences the full force of the hard realities of war when just as her romance with Bill blossoms into marriage plans he is shipped off and killed in active duty. The darkest days are enlivened by the welcome appearance of family friend Lieutenant Tony Willet (Joseph Cotton) who still carries a torch for Anne and provides in his light hearted way much needed focus and direction in those unsettling times. We see Anne develop through the course of the year from a emotionally lost housewife to a woman who develops real inner strength to be able to face the challenges ahead. She learns to become a war time welder  and realises by her example and courage that she too can be an inspiration for others as seen in the beautiful scene with fellow factory worker Zosia Koslowska (Alla Nazimova). Priority setting is something that all three women learn during the year as Jane puts aside her studies to become a war time nurse, developing a real maturity in the process and Brig does her part for the war effort by getting involved in all forms of war time activity like recycling and planting a victory garden with Colonel Smollett.As to be expected with any David O. Selznick production in his golden period every department of the production of ""Since You Went Away"" is first class. Claudette Colbert was at first reluctant to take on a role where she had a daughter as old as Jennifer Jones but Selznick convinced her that Anne Hilton was the role of a lifetime and she won a richly deserved Academy Award nomination for her performance. Jennifer Jones fresh from her triumph in ""The Song of Bernadette"" is perfect as Jane and the chemistry between her and Shirley Temple who made an excellent comeback in this film is honest and refreshing. Monty Woolley as the gruff but ultimately endearing Colonel had I feel one of his best roles here and his later scenes with his grandson and his work with Claudette Colbert in particular contains some of the most emotionaly charged exchanges in the story. ""Since You Went Away"", abounds with beautifully touching moments , the standouts being Anne's reaction to the young boy being killed on a training flight, the lazy last day Jane has with Bill in the country where they get caught in the rain, Colonel Smollett's change of heart about the value of being a ""hero"" instead of just a decent person, and best of all Jane's emotionally crushing farewell to Bill at the train station before he is shipped off. All of these while aimed at the audience's  tear ducts are very realistically written and honestly played which is the reason why almost 60 years later they are still as unforgettable as they were for war time audiences. Directed with a firm understanding of the importance of the subject matter by veteran John Cromwell the pace never lags in this epic as we see seeminly real people doing ordinary things trying to cope under difficult circumstances.""Since You Went Away"", is at the top of my list of wonderful family dramas based around World War Two and in my book is right up there with such legendary films of this era as ""Mrs. Miniver"". Certainly it contains one of the best pieces of work by Claudette Colbert and once again revealed her great talent. Films such as this which are so moving and memorable even in their simplicity make me lament the current state of much of Hollywood's output that can't come close to productions like this for sheer excellence in execution. I highly recommend this wonderful product of David O. Selznick's genius, the tribute to war time families everywhere, ""Since You Went Away"".",5,Wonderful WW2 Tribute To The Home Front,1065484800,"10 7, 2003",2003,5511,"['Peerless', 'how', 'would',

558126,AK61LQI92GTCH,B00004Y6AB,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[4, 12]","A woman and her two daughters try to cope after her husband goes off to war in 1944's SINCE YOU WENT AWAY, a four-hankie weepie made during World War II.  Boasting an all-star cast, Gone With the Wind's producer David O. Selznick, and epic length (nearly 3-hours, with intermission), this movie should be a revered classic.  However, like Gone With the Wind, it hasn't aged all that well.You can't, for the most part, fault the cast.  The redoubtable Claudette Colbert could play `ideal woman' with the best of them, and here her ability to portray quiet yearning for her departed husband is one of the movie's biggest assets.  The `ideal' theme is punctuated by Joseph Cotten, here an artist turned navy commander who loves old flame Anne Hilton from a flirtatious yet unbridgeable distance.  Agnes Moorehead as the somewhat shrill `bad' statesider is also effective.  Love to see those that sneer at rationing get their comeuppance, even if I have to wait nearly three hours for it. The revelation, though, is Robert Walker as the ""Golly gee"" youth who finds love with one of Colbert's daughters, played by Walker's then real-life wife Jennifer Jones, shortly before his unit is due to ship out.  The only other movie I've seen Walker in was Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, in which he plays probably the best film psychopath ever.  His role in this movie is as far away from Bruno Anthony as can be imagined, and it's terribly affecting.Monty Woolley, who made something of a career out of playing curmudgeons coming to dinner and nesting in a spare room, here plays a curmudgeonly retired colonel who rents a room from cash-strapped Colbert.  That he's the estranged grandfather of sweet young Robert Walker is a happy coincidence.  Shirley Temple, Colbert's other daughter, made something of a career out of charming old curmudgeons and crying on cue, both of which traits are severely tested by this movie.  It was effective when she was six, but at sixteen I found it, well, annoying.  In fact, both the Woolley and the Temple characters seemed a little convenient, a little phony.  Temple because she couldn't act, Woolley because he was too much Sheridan Whiteside from The Man Who Came to Dinner.  If they merely annoyed, Hattie McDaniel's `Fidelia' shocked and offended.  Fidelia was the Hilton's maid until Tim Hilton enlistment, at which point she was let go because the family could no longer afford her.  The movie has her returning to the Hiltons, as their maid, for no money because... well, because she loves the family so much and she can't stand to see them try to survive without her.  So, after her day job she will come `home' and play maid for the Hiltons.Look, I realize SINCE YOU WENT AWAY is supposed to be a sentimental celebration of the loved ones on the home front.  Much of it is moving and touching, especially the parts played by Cotten and Walker.

Prindle ""tprindle2""","[4, 5]","The lead Amazon reviews of this film give thorough descriptions of the plot and characters; and as I substantially agree with their views of the film, I will limit myself to my primary impressions. The black and white cinematography and camera work, noted by others, are indeed superb. The extended sequence of the USO dance is breathtaking in its dramatic flow and alternation of intimacy with stylized, dramatically distanced views of the dancers' movements on the floor of the cavernous armory. And it is refreshing to see a portrayal of a FUNCTIONAL family--something that the entertainment industry seems to have little interest in these days. Also notable is the film's considerable score; not a moment passes without appropriate orchestral accompaniment. That said, the film is too long--nearly three hours. But Selznick, Director John Cromwell, and a superb cast have bequeathed to us a look into what seems to be another world, where characters' flaws are recognized but where decency, honest emotion, and a sense of duty leavened with modesty and humor prevail, presented with nothing less than professionalism and frequently with considerable art. Wonderful that it is available on DVD! A personal note: When this film was released in 1944, I was two years old, living in Wollaston, Massachusetts with my grandparents, mother, and aunt, awaiting the return of my father (whom I met for the first time in 1946 at age four) from the South Pacific. I lived in the world shown in this film, although I was too young at the time to have much of an understanding of what was at stake.",4,Excellent but Endless,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,1589,"['lead', 'Amazon', 'film', 'give', 'thorough', 'descriptions', 'plot', 'characters', 'substantially', 'agree', 'views', 'film', 'will', 'limit', 'primary', 'impressions', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'work', 'noted', 'others', 'are', 'indeed', 'superb', 'extended', 'sequence', 'USO', 'dance', 'breathtaking', 'dramatic', 'flow', 'alternation', 'intimacy', 'stylized', 'dramatically', 'distanced', 'views', 'dancers', 'movements', 'floor', 'cavernous', 'armory', 'refreshing', 'see', 'portrayal', 'FUNCTIONAL', 'family', 'something', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'have', 'little', 'interest', 'days', 'Also', 'notable', 'film', 'considerable', 'score', 'not', 'moment', 'appropriate', 'orchestral', 'accompaniment', 'said', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'Selznick', 'Director', 'John', 'Cromwell', 'superb', 'cast', 'have', 'bequeathed', 'look', 'what', 'be', 'world', 'where', 'characters', 'flaws', 'are', 'recognized', 'where', 'decency', 'honest', 'emotion', 'sense', 'duty', 'leavened', 'modesty', 'humor', 'prevail', 'presented', 'nothing', 'less', 'professionalism', 'frequently', 'considerable', 'art', 'available', 'DVD', 'personal', 'note', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1944', 'was', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'living', 'Wollaston', 'Massachusetts', 'grandparents', 'mother', 'aunt', 'awaiting', 'return', 'father', 'whom', 'met', 'first', 'time', '1946', 'age', 'four', 'South', 'Pacific', 'lived', 'world', 'shown', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'time', 'have', 'much', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'stake']",N/A

As it is, Since You Went Away clocks in at something around 180 minutes, a famous producer's self-indulgence.  For the most part, it is wonderfully cast, my favorite role being Monty Woolley's retired colonel who adds a nice compensation to the rampant sentimentality.  Claudette Colbert is wonderful, but she can do absolutely nothing wrong in my mind, just as Robert Walker, as her daughter's love interest, can do nothing right.  That actor has always irritated me (his sleazy appearance and scratchy voice better served in a sinister role), so take my deeply subjective criticism with a grain of salt.  Innocents die, feuds are resolved, tears are shed, and I must say, for someone who can't stand maudlin movies, much of it seemed sincere enough to me and occasionally quite affecting.",3,"Nicely acted, overlong wartime drama.",987638400,"04 19, 2001",2001,926,"['can', 'guarantee', 'anyone', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'had', 'written', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'no', 'longer', 'hour', 'half', 'Went', 'Away', 'clocks', 'something', 'around', '180', 'minutes', 'famous', 'producer', 'self-indulgence', 'most', 'part', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'favorite', 'role', 'being', 'Monty', 'Woolley', 'retired', 'colonel', 'who', 'nice', 'compensation', 'rampant', 'sentimentality', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'wonderful', 'can', 'do', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'mind', 'just', 'Robert', 'Walker', 'daughter', 'love', 'interest', 'can', 'do', 'nothing', 'right', 'actor', 'always', 'irritated', 'sleazy', 'appearance', 'scratchy', 'voice', 'better', 'served', 'sinister', 'role', 'so', 'take', 'deeply', 'subjective', 'criticism', 'grain', 'salt', 'Innocents', 'die', 'feuds', 'are', 'resolved', 'tears', 'are', 'shed', 'must', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'maudlin', 'movies', 'much', 'seemed', 'sincere', 'enough', 'occasionally', 'quite', 'affecting']",N/A

The black and white cinematography (ignore the color on the box it comes in) is excellent.I understand that Claudette Colbert at first objected to playing a woman with two teenage daughters; the script manages to work in that her soldier husband is only about 40 (though he looks older than that in his photo) so I guess we're meant to think that Claudette was a child bride.  The adults in this film played almost-believable real grownups, given the film conventions of its time.  Joseph Cotten is a handsome rake on the make, Claudette does let the pressures get to her frome time to time, Agnes Moorehead plays a bitchy divorcee (was there any other kind?)  Hattie McDaniel was unfortunately relegated  again to a stereotypical black housekeeper who mangles the English language to everyone's amusement, but she as always also projects wisdom and humanity despite her sometimes silly dialogue.  Monty Wooley plays the martinet colonel with the heart of gold, but he doesn't melt too much so as to become sappy.Jennifer Jones was a overage to play a high school senior, but she really did a lovely job with this, portraying both young first love, andmaturing victim of war's tragedy.  This film is 3 hours long, and Selznick made it into an ""epic"" with an overture and entre'acte (presumably so film goers could go to the bathroom).  There is a lot of sentimentality here, and these characters aren't just individuals, but supposed to represent all the roles that people play in war (I mean really, can you imagine Claudette Colbert working as a riveter in a shipyard), but like ""Mrs Miniver"", you love these people in spite of the melodrama.

558133,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00004Y6AB,Westley,"[152, 153]","""Since You Went Away"" was released in 1944 and shows a different side of war - families coping with life stateside. The peerless Claudette Colbert stars as Anne Hilton, and the picture picks up with her entering her empty home after her husband has been deployed.  She struggles to put on a happy face for her teen daughters, played by Jennifer Jones and Shirley Temple.  All three of them make sacrifices and experience tragedies as they bravely endure war which impinges on their previously ideal middle-class life.  Into their lives come an abrasive, retired Colonel (Monty Woolley), the Colonel's timid son (Robert Walker, who was married to Jennifer Jones at the time), and a charming family friend who is stationed nearby (Joseph Cotton).Producer David O. Selznick wanted the movie to be as superior as his earlier ""Gone with the Wind.""  That comparison is a bit lofty, but ""Since You Went Away"" is extremely good - a top-notch Hollywood film in every way.  The casting and acting are superlative, particularly Colbert; Temple is also quite good in one of her few young adult roles.  The direction by John Cromwell (father of actor James) is stunning, with a multitude of intimate scenes interspersed with some incredible set-pieces, such as the USO cantina dance.  Perhaps the most famous scene takes place in a train station, with Jennifer Jones tearfully biding goodbye to her boyfriend as she runs alongside his train.  The scene was even parodied in ""Airplane!""Although the film teeters toward melodrama at times and the movie is undeniably glossy, but the script is so pitch-perfect and warm that it manages to be tremendously effective.  The film may sound like an American retread of 1942's ""Mrs. Miniver,"" but the plot is quite different and even funny at times.  The film received a number of Oscar nominations: Picture, Actress (Colbert), Supporting Actor (Woolley), Supporting Actress (Jones); it won for best score.  ""Since You Went Away"" is one of the finest war movies of the 1940s; however, perhaps because of its rather genteel tone, it's been somewhat forgotten, which is really a shame.

Even the marvellous Claudette Colbert is dragged down to what seems like a limp recitation as a result of the ponderous storyline and sometimes excruciatingly bad dialogue. A scene about a third the way into the film is representative of the strange aimlessness of the whole production. Colbert's character and an old admirer (overplayed by Joseph Cotton) are attending a USO dance when they are informed that a young flyer she knows, and with whom they had been chatting minutes before, has just been killed in a plane crash. The lad's death dulls their enjoyment of the evening for a minute or two... before they are back on the dance floor and he's making a pass at her.
