I'm hugely into this sort of stuff but until now have never found a satisfying documentary about the business of whaling.  I was afraid this was going to agonizingly short (e.g., 30 minutes), but no!  After two hours of exploring every possible angle of American whaling, you'll be hard-pressed to come up with something the documentary did not do right.",5,comprehensively satisfying,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,418,"['Wow', 'Two', 'whole', 'hours', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'satisfied', ""'m"", 'hugely', 'sort', 'stuff', 'now', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'satisfying', 'documentary', 'business', 'whaling', 'was', 'afraid', 'was', 'going', 'agonizingly', 'short', 'e.g.', '30', 'minutes', 'two', 'hours', 'exploring', 'possible', 'angle', 'American', 'whaling', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'documentary', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'right']",N/A

It covers, sometimes in great detail, the 400+ year history of whaling off the American shores.  The first Pilgrims who landed here saw a pod of sperm whale and soon word spread that there were plenty of them to help heat those cold cabins.  Makes one wonder if the large pods in the Atlantic were one reason so many came here?  Whaling was a big industry and everyone wanted a piece of the pie.  Whaling was a big piece of our American heritage.It's a brutal living, though.  At times this documentary goes into great detail of how a whale was killed.  The animal didn't always die right away, sometimes it dragged a hapless ship with it for miles before it weakened and finally blew its final bloody spew.  Young men often joined a ship for the adventure of catching a whale, of sailing around the Americas, and making it rich.There are stories here about the doomed Essex whaling ship, that lost 12 men and the remaining survived on cannibalism.  There are stories of ships getting capsized by a large whale, throwing an entire crew into the rough seas.  This documentary shows how a town like Nantucket made a living for itself before it was overtaken by other coastal towns like Bedford.Watching this video makes one realize why Hermann Melville was so passionate about his story ""Moby Dick"" but died before the story caught on.This is a little bit history, reenactment, story-telling.  It's nicely weaved together into a two-hour documentary.  I only took a star off because of its sometimes graphic depictions of whale killing, and the graphic photos of skinned whales.  This may be a bit too much for young children although the story is definitely here.This documentary takes no bias.  Yes, whales were hunted to near extinction, just like the buffalo.  Back in the 1800s conservation and environmentalism were unheard of; making money off all natural resources was the thing to do.  Whaling only died out in the 1850s because of improving technologuies, the discovery of oil in western PA, and other modern inventions of the 19th century.  It makes you think and wonder how other major craftsmen lived in the 17th and 18th century:  the wainwright or the carpenter, for instance.  It's definitely worth a watch.",4,Surprisingly good,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,2335,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'bought', 'DVD', 'soon', 'popping', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'hooked', 'sometimes', 'great', 'detail', '400+', 'year', 'history', 'whaling', 'off', 'American', 'shores', 'first', 'Pilgrims', 'who', 'landed', 'here', 'saw', 'pod', 'sperm', 'whale', 'soon', 'word', 'spread', 'were', 'plenty', 'help', 'heat', 'cold', 'cabins', 'Makes', 'one', 'wonder', 'large', 'pods', 'Atlantic', 'were', 'one', 'reason', 'so', 'many', 'came', 'here', 'Whaling', 'was', 'big', 'industry', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'piece', 'pie', 'Whaling', 'was', 'big', 'piece', 'American', 'heritage.It', 'brutal', 'living', 'though', 'times', 'documentary', 'great', 'detail', 'how', 'whale', 'was', 'killed', 'animal', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'die', 'right', 'away', 'dragged', 'hapless', 'ship', 'miles', 'weakened', 'finally', 'blew', 'final', 'bloody', 'spew', 'Young', 'men', 'often', 'joined', 'ship', 'adventure', 'catching', 'whale', 'sailing', 'Americas', 'making', 'are', 'stories', 'here', 'doomed', 'Essex', 'whaling', 'ship', 'lost', '12', 'men', 'remaining', 'survived', 'cannibalism', 'are', 'stories', 'ships', 'getting', 'capsized', 'large', 'whale', 'throwing', 'entire', 'crew', 'rough', 'seas', 'documentary', 'how', 'town', 'Nantucket', 'made', 'living', 'was', 'overtaken', 'other', 'coastal', 'towns', 'Bedford.Watching', 'video', 'one', 'realize', 'why', 'Hermann', 'Melville', 'was', 'so', 'passionate', 'story', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'died', 'story', 'caught', 'on.This', 'little', 'bit', 'history', 'reenactment', 'story-telling', 'nicely', 'weaved', 'together', 'two-hour', 'documentary', 'only', 'took', 'star', 'sometimes', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'whale', 'killing', 'graphic', 'photos', 'skinned', 'whales', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'young', 'children', 'story', 'definitely', 'here.This', 'documentary', 'bias', 'Yes', 'whales', 'were', 'hunted', 'extinction', 'just', 'buffalo', 'Back', '1800s', 'conservation', 'environmentalism', 'were', 'unheard', 'making', 'money', 'natural', 'resources', 'was', 'thing', 'do', 'Whaling', 'only', 'died', 'out', '1850s', 'improving', 'technologuies', 'discovery', 'oil', 'western', 'PA', 'other', 'modern', 'inventions', '19th', 'century', 'think', 'wonder', 'how', 'other', 'major', 'craftsmen', 'lived', '17th', '18th', 'century', 'wainwright', 'carpenter', 'instance', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch']",N/A
1347309,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B003J7HO8C,Gerard D. Launay,"[3, 3]","This 2 hour PBS Special is part of the excellent oevre of Ric Burns - the brother of Ken Burns of ""Civil War"" fame. Ric Burns did the PBS miniseries on ""New York"" which is one of the very best mini-series ever made.He has done other documentaries such as ""Coney Island.""  This movie is almost as good as his others. The filmmaker focuses on three subjects:  (1) A Dramatization of the story of  ""The Essex"" - the whaling ship that was ferociously attacked by a sperm whale in 1819 which became the inspiration behind the novel ""Moby Dick.""  (2) A biography of Herman Melville - particularly his whaling experience  (3) A quick overview of whaling history in New England with an emphasis on Nantucket and New Bedford.  The most interesting part of whale history caught on film is old black and white footage of original sailors catching a whale and then cutting it up on the whale ship.  Awesome and terrible...in all senses of the words.Ric Burns probes why the whaling industry was so important during the early years of the industrial revolution - because whale oil and whale baleen were used for lamps and commercial products before the era of petroleum and plastics.  Excessive hunting of the whales and the birth of the petrochemical industry destroyed the whale industry of America...I am curious why ships from other nations still hunt the whale. That is not explained.The tale of the Essex is as haunting an event as the tragedy of the Donner Party. Some starving seamen descended to cannibalism to stay alive.  The demise of the ship was as well known in the 19th century as the sinking of the Titanic is in the 20th century.  Why the tale slowly disappeared from the American national memory is still a mystery.",4,Fine Summary of Whaling History in America,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,1721,"['2', 'hour', 'PBS', 'Special', 'part', 'excellent', 'oevre', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'brother', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Civil', 'War', 'fame', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'did', 'PBS', 'miniseries', 'New', 'York', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'mini-series', 'ever', 'done', 'other', 'documentaries', 'such', 'Coney', 'Island', 'movie', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'others', 'filmmaker', 'three', 'subjects', '1', 'Dramatization', 'story', 'Essex', 'whaling', 'ship', 'was', 'ferociously', 'attacked', 'sperm', 'whale', '1819', 'became', 'inspiration', 'novel', 'Moby', 'Dick', '2', 'biography', 'Herman', 'Melville', 'particularly', 'whaling', 'experience', '3', 'quick', 'overview', 'whaling', 'history', 'New', 'England', 'emphasis', 'Nantucket', 'New', 'Bedford', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'whale', 'history', 'caught', 'film', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'original', 'sailors', 'catching', 'whale', 'then', 'cutting', 'up', 'whale', 'ship', 'Awesome', 'terrible', 'senses', 'words.Ric', 'Burns', 'why', 'whaling', 'industry', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'early', 'years', 'industrial', 'revolution', 'whale', 'oil', 'whale', 'baleen', 'were', 'used', 'lamps', 'commercial', 'products', 'era', 'petroleum', 'plastics', 'Excessive', 'hunting', 'whales', 'birth', 'petrochemical', 'industry', 'destroyed', 'whale', 'industry', 'America', 'am', 'curious', 'why', 'ships', 'other', 'nations', 'still', 'hunt', 'whale', 'not', 'explained.The', 'tale', 'Essex', 'haunting', 'event', 'tragedy', 'Donner', 'Party', 'starving', 'seamen', 'descended', 'cannibalism', 'stay', 'alive', 'demise', 'ship', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'known', '19th', 'century', 'sinking', 'Titanic', '20th', 'century', 'Why', 'tale', 'slowly', 'disappeared', 'American', 'national', 'memory', 'still', 'mystery']",N/A

Gordon,"[0, 0]","A sprawling, sometimes unfocused, usually fascinating and occasionally moving look at U.S. whaling from the early days of the colonies, to thebeginning of the 20th century. It does a very good job of capturing both the awful brutality, and incredible danger of the hunts.There are some talking heads, but much more is a very pleasing mix of old drawings, photographs, and modern photography of scrimshawand whaling boats (often not re- enactments as much as just striking images of the vessels at sea).For the first while the film focuses on the early history of U.S. whaling, explaining how important it was to the industrial revolution, being themajor source of oil for lighting and lubrication before the days of ground based petroleum products It also explains how the riches fromwhaling literally paid for much of the nation's expansion.It then switches tacks to tell the harrowing true story of the doomed whaling ship &#34;The Essex&#34;, a story which helped prompt Herman Melvilleto write &#34;Moby Dick&#34;. The film then spends a good deal of time on &#34;Moby Dick&#34; itself, with some excellent dramatic readings by Robert SeanLeonard, and the examination of the novel's story and its themes (with spoilers for those not familiar with the book). It also briefly traceshow &#34;Moby Dick&#34; fared in the literary world, and then circles back around for a cursory mention of the end of traditional whaling and therise of industrial whaling in the early 20th century.For me, this last transition is handled too quickly and off-handedly, the revelation that whale populations were far more depleted by the20th century whaling than in all the whaling done before &#8211; which feels contradictory to what the film had been implying up until then.But those flaws are minor, and overall this is a very good, if slightly scattered, look at a way of life that was a far bigger part of U.S.history than I ever realized.",4,"Intelligent, sprawling documentary",1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,1927,"['sprawling', 'sometimes', 'unfocused', 'usually', 'fascinating', 'occasionally', 'moving', 'look', 'U.S.', 'whaling', 'early', 'days', 'colonies', 'thebeginning', '20th', 'century', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'awful', 'brutality', 'incredible', 'danger', 'hunts.There', 'are', 'talking', 'heads', 'much', 'more', 'very', 'pleasing', 'mix', 'old', 'drawings', 'photographs', 'modern', 'photography', 'scrimshawand', 'whaling', 'boats', 'often', 'not', 're-', 'enactments', 'as', 'much', 'just', 'striking', 'images', 'vessels', 'sea', 'first', 'film', 'early', 'history', 'U.S.', 'whaling', 'explaining', 'how', 'important', 'was', 'industrial', 'revolution', 'being', 'themajor', 'source', 'oil', 'lighting', 'lubrication', 'days', 'ground', 'based', 'petroleum', 'products', 'also', 'how', 'riches', 'fromwhaling', 'literally', 'paid', 'much', 'nation', 'expansion.It', 'then', 'tacks', 'tell', 'harrowing', 'true', 'story', 'doomed', 'whaling', 'ship', '34', 'Essex', '34', 'story', 'helped', 'prompt', 'Herman', 'Melvilleto', 'write', '34', 'Moby', 'Dick', '34', 'film', 'then', 'good', 'deal', 'time', '34', 'Moby', 'Dick', '34', 'excellent', 'dramatic', 'readings', 'Robert', 'SeanLeonard', 'examination', 'novel', 'story', 'themes', 'spoilers', 'not', 'familiar', 'book', 'also', 'traceshow', '34', 'Moby', 'Dick', '34', 'fared', 'literary', 'world', 'then', 'circles', 'back', 'cursory', 'mention', 'end', 'traditional', 'whaling', 'therise', 'industrial', 'whaling', 'early', '20th', 'century.For', 'last', 'transition', 'handled', 'too', 'quickly', 'off-handedly', 'revelation', 'whale', 'populations', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'depleted', 'the20th', 'century', 'whaling', 'whaling', 'done', '8211', 'contradictory', 'what', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'implying', 'up', 'then.But', 'flaws', 'are', 'minor', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'slightly', 'scattered', 'look', 'way', 'life', 'was', 'far', 'bigger', 'part', 'U.S.history', 'ever', 'realized']",N/A
