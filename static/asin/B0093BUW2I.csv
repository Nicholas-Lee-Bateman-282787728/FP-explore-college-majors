1584931,AAW58LG72PG7I,B0093BUW2I,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","Human trafficking is one of those dirty not so secret crimes that proliferate across the world. The very sleaziness of the topic also unfortunatly tends to rub off on films that dramatize it. Mira Sorvino has twice played an anti-trafficking agent, once in TRAFFICKING and once again in TRADE OF INNOCENTS. In this latter film she is married to Dermot Mulroney, an American free-lancer living in Cambodia, both of whom are determined to cut into the vicious trading of child prostitution. One of the reviewers saw the film as more sleaze itself than as an honest look at a world wide problem. TRADE OF INNOCENTS is far more than a slimmed down TV movie of the weak. It shows much of the drama from the vantage of those most involved: the victims, the pedophiles, and the pimps. Into this mix comes Mira Sorvino, whose own child was kidnapped years earlier, thus giving her the needed emotional resonance to fight on to save other children. Actor John Billingsley (from Star Trek Enterprise) plays against type as a leering pedophile. In a film filled with many moments of power, one stood out. Dermot Mulroney is trying to ascertain if the local police would be willing to stamp out the trade even if it means cutting into the flow of incoming tourist dollars. The local police captain is openly scornful of Mulroney's ability to make a dent. Mulroney responds by noting that all grand movements begin with a dent. TRADE OF INNOCENTS may be dramatically gimmicked up but once you get involved, the only gimmick is to measure how much of humanity remains in your soul.",5,All Too Real,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,1567,"['Human', 'trafficking', 'one', 'dirty', 'not', 'so', 'secret', 'crimes', 'proliferate', 'world', 'very', 'sleaziness', 'topic', 'also', 'unfortunatly', 'rub', 'off', 'films', 'dramatize', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'twice', 'played', 'anti-trafficking', 'agent', 'once', 'TRAFFICKING', 'once', 'again', 'TRADE', 'INNOCENTS', 'latter', 'film', 'married', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'American', 'free-lancer', 'living', 'Cambodia', 'whom', 'are', 'determined', 'cut', 'vicious', 'trading', 'child', 'prostitution', 'One', 'reviewers', 'saw', 'film', 'more', 'honest', 'look', 'world', 'wide', 'problem', 'TRADE', 'INNOCENTS', 'far', 'more', 'slimmed', 'down', 'TV', 'movie', 'weak', 'much', 'drama', 'vantage', 'most', 'involved', 'victims', 'pedophiles', 'pimps', 'mix', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'own', 'child', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'years', 'earlier', 'thus', 'giving', 'needed', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'fight', 'save', 'other', 'children', 'Actor', 'John', 'Billingsley', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'type', 'leering', 'pedophile', 'film', 'filled', 'many', 'moments', 'power', 'one', 'stood', 'out', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'trying', 'ascertain', 'local', 'police', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'stamp', 'out', 'trade', 'even', 'cutting', 'flow', 'incoming', 'tourist', 'dollars', 'local', 'police', 'captain', 'openly', 'scornful', 'Mulroney', 'ability', 'make', 'dent', 'Mulroney', 'noting', 'grand', 'movements', 'begin', 'dent', 'TRADE', 'INNOCENTS', 'may', 'be', 'dramatically', 'gimmicked', 'up', 'once', 'get', 'involved', 'only', 'gimmick', 'measure', 'how', 'much', 'humanity', 'soul']",Trade of Innocents

1584939,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0093BUW2I,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I was amazed to see Mira Sorvino in this film since she had also starred in another show on human trafficking, a Showtime drama titled Human Trafficking several years ago. In Trade of Innocents, she plays Claire Becker the wife of Alex Becker (Dermot Mulroney) who is working with an organization that is out to eradicate human trafficking in Cambodia, particularly child sexual trafficking. Alex calls upon the local Cambodian police to help him, though he finds the local inspector less than enthusiastic. The Beckers are not without their own personal baggage, having lost their own young daughter some time ago.The story puts a human face on child sex trafficking. Even though it is a dramatization, many of the events portrayed in the film are inspired by real life occurrences. Foreign pedophiles come to third world nations with their fat pocketbooks, trolling for young children that they can prey on without fear of persecution unlike what they would face in the West. The local criminal organizations are able to buy off the police and keep the local population in fear of reprisals should anyone dare speak out against them, so they are able to procure young girls, some as young as five for these pedophiles. It is only through concerted efforts by organizations such as the one Alex works for that provides hope for these young, innocent victims.The movie also serves to educate - trafficking is especially rampant in societies where poverty is prevalent to the point where parents sacrifice their own children to traffickers for money to ensure their survival, no matter the high cost paid by the victims. Traffickers are able to intimidate people to keep silent so that they may continue to reap profits from their young victims, many of whom do not make it in the long run due to the toll it takes on the young victims in terms of their physical, emotional, and mental health. Yet there is an element of hope in the form of local rehabilitation efforts for rescued victims of trafficking which provide the victims a means to recuperate from their ordeal while also training them in skills that will allow them to earn their own living and concerted efforts by NGOs and also local law enforcement to arrest and prosecute foreigners caught soliciting the services of under-aged girls. The film may be low-budget but it has its heart in the right place and brings much needed attention to the issue of human trafficking.",5,Credible dramatization of the horrors of trafficking,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,2433,"['was', 'amazed', 'see', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'film', 'had', 'also', 'starred', 'show', 'human', 'trafficking', 'Showtime', 'drama', 'titled', 'Human', 'Trafficking', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Trade', 'Innocents', 'Claire', 'Becker', 'wife', 'Alex', 'Becker', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'who', 'working', 'organization', 'out', 'eradicate', 'human', 'trafficking', 'Cambodia', 'particularly', 'child', 'sexual', 'trafficking', 'Alex', 'local', 'Cambodian', 'police', 'help', 'local', 'inspector', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'Beckers', 'are', 'not', 'own', 'personal', 'baggage', 'having', 'lost', 'own', 'young', 'daughter', 'time', 'ago.The', 'story', 'human', 'face', 'child', 'sex', 'trafficking', 'Even', 'dramatization', 'many', 'events', 'portrayed', 'film', 'are', 'inspired', 'real', 'life', 'occurrences', 'Foreign', 'come', 'third', 'world', 'nations', 'fat', 'pocketbooks', 'trolling', 'young', 'children', 'can', 'prey', 'fear', 'persecution', 'what', 'would', 'face', 'West', 'local', 'criminal', 'organizations', 'are', 'able', 'buy', 'off', 'police', 'keep', 'local', 'population', 'fear', 'reprisals', 'should', 'anyone', 'dare', 'speak', 'out', 'are', 'able', 'procure', 'young', 'girls', 'as', 'young', 'five', 'pedophiles', 'only', 'concerted', 'efforts', 'organizations', 'such', 'one', 'Alex', 'hope', 'young', 'innocent', 'victims.The', 'movie', 'also', 'educate', 'trafficking', 'especially', 'rampant', 'societies', 'where', 'poverty', 'prevalent', 'point', 'where', 'parents', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'children', 'traffickers', 'money', 'ensure', 'survival', 'matter', 'high', 'cost', 'paid', 'victims', 'Traffickers', 'are', 'able', 'intimidate', 'people', 'keep', 'silent', 'may', 'continue', 'reap', 'profits', 'young', 'victims', 'many', 'whom', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'long', 'run', 'due', 'toll', 'young', 'victims', 'terms', 'physical', 'emotional', 'mental', 'health', 'element', 'hope', 'form', 'local', 'rehabilitation', 'efforts', 'rescued', 'victims', 'trafficking', 'provide', 'victims', 'means', 'recuperate', 'ordeal', 'also', 'training', 'skills', 'will', 'allow', 'earn', 'own', 'living', 'concerted', 'efforts', 'NGOs', 'also', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'arrest', 'prosecute', 'foreigners', 'caught', 'soliciting', 'services', 'under-aged', 'girls', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'low-budget', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'brings', 'much', 'needed', 'attention', 'issue', 'human', 'trafficking']",Trade of Innocents
