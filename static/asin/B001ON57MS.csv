A great story about believing in yourself and your dreams and stepping outside of the box, whether put there by you or those around you.""Spectacular"" covers the spectrum of both young people with dreams and hopes for their future and older folks who think their chance at fulfilling the dreams or enjoyments of life has passed them by.

I have to admit a weakness for these types of musicals, yep musical.  Now the meat and potatoes. Who knew that in addition to being a fine actor that Nolan Gerard Funk could sing! And very well too. The story is a simple one, egomaniac joins small &#34;group&#34; to get money and money only and then learns there are things more important. Lovely and attractive cast, lovely and toe-tapping music and just a lot of fun, for the kinds and the grown-ups, too.
