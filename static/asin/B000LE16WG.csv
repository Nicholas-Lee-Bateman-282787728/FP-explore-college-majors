1039182,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B000LE16WG,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[0, 0]","First off I will say I am not a big Max and Ruby fan, I feel like it is strange that their parents are never seen and Ruby does everything, with that though this is a cute DVD.  It includes 12 episodes featuring Max and Ruby, with Max always saving the day.  It is 1.5 hours of fun and mischief.  Cute show that is wholesome for young kids.  I like how Max is an outside the box thinker and always saving the day!  While these episodes have been previously aired on television, it has been nice to have them all on one DVD.Episodes include:Ruby's Easter BonnetMax's Easter ParadeMax and the Easter BunnyRuby's Loose ToothRuby Scores!Ruby's Sand CastleMax's Work of ArtMax Meets MorrisRuby's Scavenger HuntMax's Check-UpSpace Max",4,12 episodes!,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,728,"['First', 'off', 'will', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'Max', 'Ruby', 'fan', 'feel', 'strange', 'parents', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'Ruby', 'everything', 'cute', 'DVD', '12', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'Max', 'Ruby', 'Max', 'always', 'saving', 'day', '1.5', 'hours', 'fun', 'mischief', 'Cute', 'show', 'wholesome', 'young', 'kids', 'how', 'Max', 'box', 'thinker', 'always', 'saving', 'day', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'previously', 'aired', 'television', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'one', 'DVD.Episodes', 'include', 'Ruby', 'Easter', 'BonnetMax', 'Easter', 'ParadeMax', 'Easter', 'BunnyRuby', 'Loose', 'ToothRuby', 'Ruby', 'Sand', 'CastleMax', 'Work', 'ArtMax', 'Meets', 'MorrisRuby', 'Scavenger', 'HuntMax', 'Check-UpSpace', 'Max']",Max & Ruby - Easter With Max & Ruby
