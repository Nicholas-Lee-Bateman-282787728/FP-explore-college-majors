But this rollercoaster just sputters to a grinding halt before bursting into flames in one of the worst endings I have ever seen in this genre.The end result is a fairly decent hour-long suspense vehicle sandwiched between fifty extra minutes of nothing special--a dreary, uncomfortable start and an absurd conclusion.

Gerald Butler plays a engineer who goes more than a little mad after his family is killed and the killer gets off scotfree via plea bargain by turning in and blaming it all on his accomplice. Flash forward to ten years later and Gerald's character unleashes a revenge scheme so grandiose and detailed you can't help but be impressed with his determination. Jamie Foxx plays the DA who allowed the plea bargain to go through and who now has to watch Butler destroy everyone involved in the original murder trial before he goes after the American ""justice"" system itself.This is a great concept but there are a few problems. All of the protagonists in the film are utterly unlikeable. They are shallow short sighted and well, they're pretty much self-obsessed jerks without any redeeming qualities. Butler's character, as insane as he is, is the most likeable person in the film and you find yourself rooting for him if only because a) everyone he is targeting does deserve it and b) everyone he is targeting come off worse than this serial murderer.My other issue is the ending. I'm not going to spoil it, but there are some huge plot holes and things that could happen based on time, location and prior characterization throughout the movie.

Your initial horror and sympathy begins to wane when you watch him tie up and torture someone to death, the end result making him as psychotic and unbalanced as the men who killed his family. And who knows, maybe that's the message of the movie, that grief and revenge can tip you over the edge? Or is the message that the legal system doesn't work? Whichever it is, it would have been better to channel those ideas into just making a movie, and not being a ""clever"" director by telling us what's wrong with the World. Most of us already know thanks.At least most of the movie is feasible, even if it's unlikely. 10 years have passed since the trial, time enough for Butler to set his master-plan into action.

1297817,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B002XMGGJM,amerdale876,"[2, 3]","I've always loved revenge movies. Just as romantic comedies are a big favorite of many women (including my wife), I am a sucker for a great revenge flick! Some might say about revenge films the same as I do about rom-coms: they're all the same and 99.5% predictable. However, with F. Gary Gray's latest, ""Law Abiding Citizen,"" he takes the revenge formula and gives it a twist. Rarely do we see in any revenge film, whether it'sDeath Wish,Eye For An Eye, ""The Count of Monte Cristo,""Man On Fire [Blu-ray], ""Kill Bill,"" or the more recentTaken [Blu-ray], where the protagonist becomes so enraged over his/her loss that even though it's driven them to such an extreme as revenge, it never pushes them over that fine line of punishing those who didn't ""have it coming"" to them.Well, in ""Citizen,"" we meet Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) who's a simple family man, soldering away at his home desk as his adorable little daughter is stringing beads together to create a bracelet. With only a minute or two of dialogue between father and daughter, there's a knock at the door and Shelton goes to answer. Instantly the action begins as two robbers break in, incapacitate Shelton then proceed to rape and murder his wife as well as murdering his daughter. A month or two later, hot-shot prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is trying the murderers in Shelton's family homicide case. Rice regretfully admits to his mentor and boss District Attorney Jonas Cantrell (Bruce McGill, playing the usual smarmy trait invoked in most of his recent characters) that in order to keep his high conviction rate up to par and climbing, he accepted a deal with the main murderer, I mean, suspect Clarence Darby so that he could get a conviction of Darby's inept accomplice Rupert Ames, thus sending Ames to death row. However, when presenting the deal to Shelton, Rice explains that the only way to get a definite conviction at all is to take the deal with Darby, which would only result in him being given a measly five years in jail (for third degree murder). An emotional Shelton disagrees and begs to try for a conviction on both suspects since he knows Darby was the main perpetrator. Rice says the deal is already done and even though it disgusts Rice, he follows through with the deal, even being coerced into shaking Darby's hand outside of the courthouse, cameras flashing away. Then we see Shelton witness this, almost as terrified and betrayed as when he witnessed his wife being murdered, and that, my friends, is when the movie really kicks into gear. That is what pushes Shelton over the edge to exact a revenge plot that sends the entire city of Philadelphia into a panic.Ten years later, Shelton not only takes revenge on the murderers of his family, he holds everyone accountable - from Darby's attorney all the way up to the mayor (Viola Davis) and the justice system itself. So, of course, that means he holds Rice accountable. The film stretches into an enjoyable cat-and-mouse game between Rice and Shelton, but, unlike those previous films I mentioned, there is no absolute good or evil here. The audience is left to feel that Rice can't necessarily be held accountable since he is ""only doing his job,"" and it's difficult for the audience to hold conviction for Shelton, an innocent man who lost his entire family so violently. So, in order to ease the audience's minds, the writer Kurt Wimmer (Street Kings (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray],Ultraviolet [Blu-ray]) sets one particular scene that sets Rice and Shelton apart, assigning a good and an evil. Believe me, you'll know it when you see it. When this scene plays, the audience is left to ask: should a person(s) who unknowingly abetted a known felon be held accountable for the felon's actions? This predicament is explored in all kinds of media, even comic books (i.e., should Batman be held accountable for all the people the Joker has killed when he could have stopped him by killing him?). The answer is different for all of us and the scene with which I'm referring, screams, ""No!"" And in a lot of cases, they may be right. All I can say is that this movie's scene still didn't convince me to scream the negative in my mind. Even when it's shown that Shelton's past in black-ops helps explain his genius, all the while edging him more to the experienced ""psychopath"" status, it doesn't take away from the fact that Shelton's wife and daughter are no more innocent than the career-climbing, shallow prosecutor who took a plea bargain from a possible killer who could've easily been convicted in court. Nor should Shelton's wife and daughter's lives be pitted in the same category as their killers, Darby and Ames. While Shelton's methods are at times extreme, there is no measure or limit of pain for someone who has gone through such a loss. And anyone who's gone through such a loss feels he has nothing left to lose. This movie is a testament to that.Still, the main question here (as with all revenge pics) is: Does his unfair loss justify all the death that he's caused? Sadly, I don't think a movie can truly answer this moral ambiguity. I say this because, in a movie most times, we the audience see the truth of the matter that the characters in the film did/do not see. In ""Citizen,"" we see that Darby is the main killer of Shelton's family and therefore most of the audience have already agreed in their minds that he should be punished in some way and not given a plea bargain. But that is not what Rice knows in the film and so he makes the wrong decision which leaves a majority of the audience not liking his character; especially when we find out that he did it just so he could keep his 96% conviction rate to someday climb to gain D.A. status. The true test of morality in a film such as this comes when even the audience doesn't know whether the person under suspicion did the crime or not (case in point, Clint Eastwood'sMystic River [Blu-ray]). Only then are our morals truly tested.When we know who the real culprit is, most of the audiences' opinions are already formed, leaving the rest of the movie hoping for the ""good guy"" to prevail and the ""bad guy(s)"" to face justice. That's why I sometimes enjoy revenge films. They're not always about trying to leave an indelible impression on the audience so that they continue to discuss the film hours after its ending. Mostly, revenge films are just genre action flicks where the good guy and bad guy duke it out. And while ""Citizen"" desperately attempts to be a morality tale of turning the avenger into a psychopath, and thus making the audience question revenge and whether the world is truly black and white, it doesn't live up to those films which do convey this question/message: ""Mystic River,""Munich (Widescreen Edition), andThe Prestige [Blu-ray]. This film did a great job at the art of revenge but its ending was something to be desired. I feel like the writer tried too hard to make it into something it wasn't: a thinking-man's revenge thriller. The vengeance that Shelton takes on each of his prey is methodical but also fitting to the responsibility he believes they had in his family's injustice.Overall, I really enjoyed ""Law Abiding Citizen."" While I loved the beginning and middle - and the pacing was excellent - the very ending was a little too morally self-righteous and unbelievable for me to swallow. Not only is it unbelievable about how Shelton continues his vengeance while still in prison, but what's most unbelievable is how Rice and Shelton come to a head at the end. Those last 15 minutes of the film while a little tense were, nevertheless, a bit droll but also mostly unfitting to a story that gave so much potential in its first 94 minutes. It seemed as if the writer planned on penning a great revenge thriller, but, at last minute, changed his mind and wanted to try to send some deep, affecting message. And while that works for films like ""Mystic River"" or ""Munich"" - movies where revenge (although prevalent) takes a backseat to morals and humanity - it just didn't for this film, where gore, violence, catchy one-liners and many different ways of killing someone was at the forefront.",4,Three-and-a-half stars for a decent revenge thriller,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,8144,"[""'ve"",

The killers are soon caught and Nick Rice (Foxx), a hotshot prosecutor, is assigned to the case. Over Shelton's objection, Rice strikes a plea bargain with one of the suspects to testify against his accomplice. The story then flashes forward ten years. Shelton begins his revenge by killing the men who murdered his family. His plans are however much larger than that. He quickly is taken into custody and admits his guilt. Now confronted by Rice, he tells him more people will die unless he exposes the corruption in the system! Rice quickly finds himself in a cat and mouse game, where Shelton always seems two steps ahead!This was a good movie. Butler was excellent as always. I am not a fan of Foxx, but he was serviceable in this role. This is a great revenge tale. As a husband and father, I was rooting for Shelton all the way. However, this is not a 4 or 5 star film as some suggest. The revelations at the end of the movie are a little to far fetched and take away from the suspense that was so well put together for most of the movie. Still, it certainly is worth a watch.NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: The film was sharp looking and the sound was good. This is not the type of movie that has a lot of eye candy. Most of the film takes place in dark and dingy settings. SPECIAL FEATURES: Nothing special here. Standard featurette stuff.

A high quality genre piece, with solid casting in many smaller roles, the film has a highly derivative feel despite an effort to provide a serious twist to story expectations. It is in many ways a standard revenge story, that might in some ways be phrased as the answer to the question: ""What if Richard Kimble, in ""The Fugitive"", instead of running from his conviction had embraced it, and was also uniquely qualified to mete out revenge to everyone who had allowed the real killer to go free?""The film opens with a husband, wife and daughter being brutally knifed and beaten by home invaders. The husband survives, but the wife and daughter perish. Later, when the killers have been identified and brought to trial, Jamie Foxx, as a polished and ambitious assistant district attorney preoccupied with working the system to get a high conviction rate, even if justice is short changed, makes a deal that convicts one of the two men, who only watched the murders being committed, while giving a light sentence to the man who did the actual crime in exchange for his testimony that guarantees Foxx a conviction of the accomplice. The husband/survivor swears revenge on the corrupt system, but how this is accomplished builds some interesting twists into the formula to keep the audience's attention.The husband sets a long term plan to track down and brutally murder the killers of his family. Ten years after the original crime, the convicted accomplice, who only watched the murders and is set to be executed by lethal injection, dies a horrible death when the husband somehow manages to rig the lethal ""cocktail"" given at the execution to create as much pain and agony as possible. The real killer, who received a lighter plea bargain sentence and has been released already, is lured to a remote warehouse and then brutally murdered, bit by bloody bit, in a way that calls to mind the gore and sadism of the ""Saw"" films. The husband then allows himself to be captured, convicted and imprisoned himself for that crime, and then begins to orchestrate a campaign of remote control death that baffles the police and the district attorney.The tension built up by the puzzle of how the victim turned avenger then manages to kill the attorneys and officials originally involved in the failed prosecution of the killers of his wife and daughter, ten years before, is largely wasted in a gimmicky wrap up that is mostly about making sure the killer gets his comeuppance by the hour and forty-five minute mark of the film.Foxx is a great reason to watch the film.

I had the opportunity to watch it back in January but I kept putting it off until this afternoon.  What a terrible decision on my part!  Law Abiding Citizen is awesome.A man (Gerard Butler's character) answers the door one night and a robber breaks in.  He then ties up Gerard Butler and kills his daughter and wife.  Later, when the robber/murderer is correctly identified, Jamie Foxx (playing the role of a lawyer) allows the bad guy to go free.  This of course, hurts Gerard Butler's feelings; watching the man who murdered his family walk free with no punishment whatsoever.  So what does he do?He gets revenge 10 years later.  Of course he doesn't call it revenge, but whatever.  Without spoiling too much, Gerard Butler eventually finds the man who murdered his family and tortures the living *heck* out of him.  Now the way the torture segment takes place requires viewers to suspend disbelief because it's almost impossible for all the events to fall into place correctly to allow everything concerning the bad guy to go as planned.  I'm of course referring to a certain phone call that encourages the bad guy to run along the rooftops of the buildings and assume he's being led to safety.  This entire segment is hard to believe and you'll know exactly what I mean when you watch the movie.  I don't want to say exactly how everything falls into place, but yeah- you already know it's a movie and not reality anyway.  At least I HOPE so. :)It doesn't end there either.  While locked up in jail, Gerard Butler messes with Jamie Foxx's character by telling him how he's going to be prosecuted.  At first it seems like the character of Gerald Butler is absolutely crazy the way he's able to dictate his own fate, so to speak.  Soon, it's revealed he has an accomplice.  At least I *think* so.  I don't recall actually seeing him.  I just LOVE the way Gerard Butler is able to completely take over the entire FBI, the police department and everybody else, and continue his little rampage of violence all the while being locked up in jail!Anyway, it's important to note that once Gerard Butler is arrested for torturing the man who murdered his family, the movie does NOT turn into a typical lawyer film.  This is most certainly a suspense/action packed movie the way Gerard Butler continues to take out his anger on those who may have been even SLIGHTLY in any way, shape or form connected to his family's murder.

Rice keeps his winning streak and Darby, the real killer, walks after serving a light sentence while his partner is sentenced to death by lethal injection. Feeling betrayed by the broken and corrupt criminal justice system, Shelton becomes a man obsessed. He lets himself get captured and uses his brilliant mind to orchestrate a series of vengeful acts from his jail cell (sort of like the Joker inThe Dark Knight) in order to teach the world a lesson about justice, a lesson taught in blood and dead bodies.Without giving away any major plot points not already divulged by the DVD box art or Amazon's editorial review (which has some wrong info), Law Abiding Citizen is just utterly ridiculous and strains credulity, even when one generously suspends disbelief. The problem is that it's written by Kurt Wimmer, who after the cult hitEquilibrium, went on to make the super terrible and idioticUltraviolet. With flimsy character development and nonsensical plot devices, this far-fetched thriller handles story progression with the subtlety and grace of a sledgehammer. The setup within the first 5 minutes is an absurd and simple-minded way to justify the rest of the movie. Shelton, a brilliant inventor with a dozen patents, is at home with his daughter tinkering away when a loud and urgent pounding comes from the front door. He opens the door, two men rush in, bound and gag him and proceed to brutalize his wife. How can someone be so stupid? Being the talented engineer, you'd think he'd have some sort of advanced video security system, or at least think to look through the peephole before opening up the door. There is no explanation for the motivation behind the brutal and sadistic crime, how the investigation was bungled, or why Shelton was left alive. All this is glossed over.After the brief trial, 10 years go by in one camera pan, yet no one has visibly aged a day. Now Shelton sets his devious plans in motion, first exacting his revenge on the two killers, then on all those involved in the case. What doesn't follow is why Shelton devotes a decade to plotting this huge elaborate scheme, spending his entire life savings, setting up a shell company and convoluted finances when he could've simply offed the guilty parties over the years through covert means. Not enough development (actually, none) is shown on how this soft-spoken engineer becomes this obsessed madman bent on thinking he can change the system. There are enough plot holes and faults of logic for a herd of elephants to fall through. His evolution from peaceful family man with no history of violence to cold, calculating serial killer capable of gross mutilation, torture, and assassination is unconvincing. (You'll see two very graphic acts of murder committed by Shelton, one involving a power saw and another involving a spork). Instead, we just skip ahead 10 years and he's already a hardened sadist and unflinching murderer in his own right. The revelation at the end into his methods is ludicrous and too outlandish. It's all very Batman-ish. You'll know what I mean when you see it.Fans of MacGyver will get a kick out of seeing Bruce McGill (Jack) as Nick Rice's mentor, but otherwise, none of the characters except he and the young female research attorney are likable. This film ask us to make any emotional investment in the one-dimensional characters, so we don't care if they lived or died. I can only recommend this as a rental, or if you are particularly fond of Foxx, Butler, or director F. Gary Gray. It can be entertaining on a boring evening, but don't expect too much out of this far-fetched thriller. A thought-provoking drama, it is not. 3.5/5 at best.On a final note, this DVD gets points for sporting an environmentally-friendlier case design from Eco-box that uses less plastic. It's lighter and supposedly recyclable.

1297844,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B002XMGGJM,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[0, 0]","I have to admit that I had reservations before watching this film. You see, you get tired of Hollywood's old formula of making action flicks after a while. But, I have to say that ""Law-Abiding Citizen"" is different, and quite satisfying. It is a rare, smart, ""kick-ass, feel-good"" movie that keeps you interested all the way.The film stars Gerard Butler as Clyde Shelton, a decent, family-loving father, whose world was about to change. One night, two intruders got access to his house, knocked him down, and tied his hands and legs. His wife was brutally raped and murdered in front of him. His precious, little daughter is also assassinated, without Clyde being able to do anything. Luckily, the two perpetrators are captured and sent to jail. The case is handled by Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a young prosecutor with a promising future. However, the best that he could do was to send one of the assassins to prison and a certain death penalty, and the other free after a brief sentence. This, clearly, is not what Shelton wants and deserves. He feels that the system failed him, and will take justice into his own hands. The criminals are taken care of, of course, but that is not all. He also goes after Rice and the whole District Attorney's office, with the intent of trying to change a system that favors criminals, declaring ""war with this broken thing,"" predicting that ""it is going to be biblical."" Shelton is smart and dangerous; with the knowledge to get his revenge in a clever and ingenious way""Law-Abiding Citizen"" is very entertaining and dynamic, and will make you sheer for Butler. You may not like the ending - as I did --, but the ride to get there is quite spectacular.

Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler are superb actors and are at the top of their game in this movie.  Foxx plays the D.A. that lets Butler's daughter's murderer off with only minimum jail time for cooperation and testimony against the other, lesser guilty accomplice.  That begins a long drawn out and tightly woven ""cat & mouse"" chain reaction that leads to Foxx believing Butler is behind an attempt to ""punish"" all in involved in the injustice of his daughter's murder.  This movie feels much more like a psychological thriller or something similar to a horror movie like Saw - much more than it feels like a typical crime drama.  The movie Se7en had a very different story line, but at times throughout the movie I was reminded how much that movie and this movie had in common.

1297860,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002XMGGJM,Craig Whittle,"[1, 2]","LAW ABIDING CITIZENSTARRING: Jamie Foxx, Gerard Butler, Leslie Bibb, Colm Meaney, Bruce McGill, Regina Hall, Michael Irby and Viola DavisWRITTEN BY: Kurt WimmerDIRECTED BY: F. Gary GrayRated: RGenre: Action / ThrillerRelease Date: 16 October 2009I don't know exactly what I was expecting Law Abiding Citizen to be like; but I know I wasn't expecting Saw meets The Punisher! It's a thriller more than an action or horror picture, but it embodies similar elements of both these genres.You need to ensure that when you take your seat, you are completely ready, because when the movie starts, it starts! I'm not sure whether it was due to editing for time or if it was the filmmaker's direct intention, but we get the wind knocked out of us from the get-go. While I was not a fan of this method for this particular film, I can see how most will appreciate it a great deal.We meet Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) and his family for about three seconds before they are attacked by two intruders. Clyde witnesses his wife and daughter being butchered and brutalized in front of his very eyes, before being left for dead himself. I'll admit it was very shocking, but we don't even get to know the characters at all before they are slain; so for the rest of the film we have no sense of who they were. Two or three minutes more with them would have been sufficient for me.We move forward and learn Clyde has survived and that the assistant district attorney of Philadelphia, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), has been appointed to his case. Nick is rushed and impatient with Clyde when he does not agree to the plea-bargain that Nick has been ordered by the DA to make; one of the killers will testify against his partner for a lessoned prison sentence. Nick believes this deal is better than no deal, as due to a loop-hole, both killers could walk. Nick informs him that it's too late to negotiate; the deal has gone through and that's just the way the system works.  Clyde is devastated but there is nothing he can do. Or is there?10 years go by and Nick has had a successful career and now has a daughter of his own. We have no idea what Clyde has been up to; until the execution of one of the killers goes horribly wrong. When the other killer winds up brutally murdered, all evidence points directly to Clyde.It's clear that Clyde expected to be arrested because after these two sadistic, well planned killings (which I will not describe in detail), we know he is smarter than anyone else in the film.Once arrested, he outsmarts Nick in a very well written and acted scene and that's just the first of many similar amazing moments. More people start dying; all linked to Clyde's case. But Clyde is locked up. Can he really be responsible? Yes he can. We learn along with everyone else in the film, that Clyde is not your every day guy.He has a past similar to that of Rambo. In one particular scene, Nick interviews someone that Clyde worked with in the past. The man flat out tells Nick, ""If he wants you dead... you're dead.""On top of all that, Clyde's spent the last decade familiarizing himself with the law and the supposed justice system. Eventually he is in a place to bargain with the city and Nick is forced to act as a liaison between Clyde and Philadelphia. Clyde gets under Nick's skin by asking for ridiculous favors in exchange for some self-incriminating information. He is exposing how corrupt the system actually is.One of the great things about a film like Law Abiding Citizen is that you are entertained visually by the action sequences, but at the same time this is a film that really makes you think. You can't help but ask yourself what you would do if you were in Clyde's shoes and this happened to you.I didn't feel like Jamie Foxx really brought his full potential to this film like I have seen him do in others. On the other hand, he's such an extraordinary actor that perhaps this role was just too simple for him.Gerard Butler is an amazing actor. He has a wide range of roles he can play. From his barbarian of a character in 300 to his romantic side in P.S., I Love You; Butler has shown us his vast range of talent.  In this film you believe him in every scene and he and Foxx make a good match for each other.Some of the things Clyde pulls off are a little far-fetched; but the film was beautifully written and directed, and is full of twists and turns that you will never see coming. The movie races forward like a bullet tearing through flesh and we are along for the ride, loving every minute of it.",4,Law Abiding Citizen Review,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,4518,"['LAW', 'ABIDING', 'CITIZENSTARRING', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'Michael', 'Irby', 'Viola', 'DavisWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Kurt', 'WimmerDIRECTED', 'BY', 'F.', 'Gary', 'GrayRated', 'RGenre', 'Action', '/', 'ThrillerRelease', 'Date', '16', 'October', '2009I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'be', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Saw', 'Punisher', 'thriller', 'more', 'action', 'horror', 'picture', 'similar', 'elements', 'genres.You', 'need', 'ensure', 'when', 'take', 'seat', 'are', 'completely', 'ready', 'when', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'due', 'editing', 'time', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'direct', 'intention', 'get', 'wind', 'knocked', 'get-go', 'was', 'not', 'fan', 'method', 'particular', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'most', 'will', 'appreciate', 'great', 'deal.We', 'meet', 'Clyde', 'Shelton', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'family', 'three', 'seconds', 'are', 'attacked', 'two', 'intruders', 'Clyde', 'wife', 'daughter', 'being', 'butchered', 'brutalized', 'front', 'very', 'eyes', 'being', 'left', 'dead', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'very', 'shocking', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'are', 'slain', 'so', 'rest', 'film', 'have', 'sense', 'who', 'were', 'Two', 'three', 'minutes', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sufficient', 'me.We', 'move', 'forward', 'learn', 'Clyde', 'survived', 'assistant', 'district', 'attorney', 'Philadelphia', 'Nick', 'Rice', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'been', 'appointed', 'case', 'Nick', 'rushed', 'impatient', 'Clyde', 'when', 'not', 'agree', 'plea-bargain', 'Nick', 'been', 'ordered', 'DA', 'make', 'one', 'killers', 'will', 'testify', 'partner', 'lessoned', 'prison', 'sentence', 'Nick', 'deal', 'better', 'deal', 'due', 'loop-hole', 'killers', 'could', 'walk', 'Nick', 'too', 'late', 'negotiate', 'deal', 'gone', 'just', 'way', 'system', 'Clyde', 'devastated', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'there', '10', 'years', 'go', 'Nick', 'had', 'successful', 'career', 'now', 'daughter', 'own', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Clyde', 'been', 'up', 'execution', 'one', 'killers', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'When', 'other', 'killer', 'up', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'evidence', 'points', 'directly', 'Clyde.It', 'clear', 'Clyde', 'expected', 'be', 'arrested', 'because', 'two', 'sadistic', 'well', 'planned', 'killings', 'will', 'not', 'describe', 'detail', 'know', 'smarter', 'anyone', 'else', 'film.Once', 'arrested', 'Nick', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'scene', 'just', 'first', 'many', 'similar', 'amazing', 'moments', 'More', 'people', 'start', 'dying', 'linked', 'Clyde', 'case', 'Clyde', 'locked', 'up', 'Can', 'really', 'be', 'responsible', 'Yes', 'can', 'learn', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'Clyde', 'not', 'day', 'guy.He', 'past', 'similar', 'Rambo', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'Nick', 'someone', 'Clyde', 'worked', 'past', 'man', 'out', 'tells', 'Nick', 'dead', ""'re"", 'dead', 'top', 'Clyde', 'spent', 'last', 'decade', 'familiarizing', 'law', 'supposed', 'justice', 'system', 'Eventually', 'place', 'bargain', 'city', 'Nick', 'forced', 'act', 'liaison', 'Clyde', 'Philadelphia', 'Clyde', 'Nick', 'skin', 'asking', 'ridiculous', 'favors', 'exchange', 'self-incriminating', 'information', 'exposing', 'how', 'corrupt', 'system', 'actually', 'is.One', 'great', 'things', 'film', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'are', 'entertained', 'visually', 'action', 'sequences', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'really', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'ask', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'Clyde', 'shoes', 'happened', 'you.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'really', 'brought', 'full', 'potential', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'do', 'others', 'other', 'hand', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'actor', 'perhaps', 'role', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'simple', 'him.Gerard', 'Butler', 'amazing', 'actor', 'wide', 'range', 'roles', 'can', 'play', 'barbarian', 'character', '300', 'romantic', 'side', 'P.S.', 'Love', 'Butler', 'shown', 'vast', 'range', 'talent', 'film', 'believe', 'scene', 'Foxx', 'make', 'good', 'match', 'other.Some', 'things', 'Clyde', 'off', 'are', 'little', 'far-fetched', 'film', 'was', 'beautifully', 'written', 'directed', 'full', 'twists', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'coming', 'movie', 'forward', 'bullet', 'tearing', 'flesh', 'are', 'along', 'ride', 'loving', 'minute']",N/A

When the movie opens with bucolic sweet scenes in the lovely suburban house, and there is a knock on the door - don't answer the door! You'd think movie characters would understand that by now. I spoil nothing by telling you that two men bind and gag the wife and husband (Gerard Butler), stab both of them, then one rapes the mother while the daughter stands in the doorway (the rapist says, 'that's OK, kids like me').So if you can stomach that opening sequence, then this is the perfect movie for you. If, on the other hand, this sounds like a bad idea, please move on and don't rent or purchase this film. Sadly, I forged ahead and watched the entire film. The highlight was somebody being dismembered with a cut off circular saw.There is a thriller in this movie. The ending sort of does explain the opening, why those two men were at Nick Rice's house. And there are a few interesting twists and turns. But generally this film is about low spots just waiting around for the next bit of gore or action sequence. Butler and Foxx are much better actors than this film.Clyde Shelton (Jamie Foxx - Tubbs in the Miami Vice movie), is a lawyer prosecuting Nick Rice (Gerard Butler - 300) for a vigilante murder. Clyde is most concerned with his nearly 100% conviction rate, and he won't let that record be spoiled by this crazy Nick guy. At moments the movie feels a little like Hannibal Lecter. But nowhere near that creepy, or intelligent, so Law Abiding Citizen is not nearly as good. I can't put my finger on why, but there is something similar to The Shooter.This was a big budget film. The camera work, sound, and special effects reflect all that money poured into this lovely film. Yes there is a polish to this work. The director did a really wonderful job with The Italian Job, it seems like F. Gary Gray might be a one hit wonder. This film show little care for pacing.Oh this is an R rated movie by a long margin. Pick your reason (actually there is no nudity), and it should only be viewed by a mature audience. The film displays graphic sick ways of killing people.

1297863,A3HCCW3SPK41VG,B002XMGGJM,Darius Williamson,"[7, 14]","Law Abiding Citizen is the kind of movie that falls apart when thinking about its shaky logic for too long.  And by shaky logic, I mean the kind that requires you to be clinically dead to successfully suspend disbelief.  Harsh as that assessment may be, it's deserved for a plot that insults the audience's intelligence constantly as the plot unravels.At least the movie kicks off with a bang.  One night, Mechanical engineer Clyde Shelton's (Gerald Butler) peaceful dinner with his wife and grade school daughter gets interrupted by two thugs breaking into the house.  Darby, the deadlier of the intruding duo, stabs Clyde and his wife, leaves them for dead, and kidnaps their daughter.  Darby's partner merely witnesses the grisly exchange in abject horror, and also flees.Clyde survived the ordeal, but not his wife and daughter.  Months later, Clyde and his attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) prepared a surefire criminal case against Darby, but during the actual trial, the prooceedings take a startling 180.  Darby only gets a few years, while his accomplice gets a death sentence.  After the trial concluded, Clyde learned that Darby paid Rice under the table to tip the scales towards his favor.  Disgusted by the betrayal, Clyde crafts a revenge plot to get back at the justice system that failed him.  After ten years of planning - right when Darby's parter faces execution by lethal injection, and when Rice has a daughter of his own - Clyde makes the first vengeful move.What follows is a mish mash of unfortunate events for anyone and everyone involved in Darby's crime and Clyde's case.  The cliff notes version: Clyde sets up a gruesome but justifiable death for Darby, gets arrested for the killing, and sparks off a string of murders against various members of the justice department while he's behind bars...somehow.  And that's where the problems begin; for the lawyers and the movie itself.The further along the master plan progresses, the less sense it makes.  Even with a decade of spare time for Clyde to arrange his numerous assassinations, too many unknown factors can ruin any potential gambit he's planning.  Like, for one, if Clyde was not transferred to a specific penitentiary for his crime, his plan would have failed from the start.  Clyde's setups also depended on other irrational decisions, like judges pandering to a detained prisoner's megalomaniacal wishes (he'd be thrown in the hole or beaten by guards anywhere else), or not sending enough guards to watch Clyde 24/7 when things really going south for them.  And the grand reveal that explains how Clyde pulled them all off (including a halfway believable ""second man"" theory among the possibilities)?  Pure wallbanger. Not even Fox's Prison Break felt this preposterous.Even if the plan was logically sound, that hardly excuses Clyde's unsympathetic decisions along the way.  It's hard not to root for him when he shreds Darby to pieces with a buzz saw, but recording the murder and sending the DVD to Rice's living room - how Clyde pulled this off is another unsolved mystery - in order to scare Rice's wife and daughter, who did nothing to antagonize him?  Clyde justifies this act to show Rice how helpless he felt when Darby terrorized his family, but how anyone can root for him after that stunt, god knows.  And this is before Clyde goes after attorneys and judges barely involved (or not involved) with the case, or offing a prisoner for simply being in the way, or spiking the drugs injected into Darby's partner to make him die very painfully during the lethal injection.  At one point, you begin to wonder why nobody informed Clyde that he's become more sadistic than Darby.But most disturbing of all is the ridiculous Aesop the filmmakers are selling with Law Abiding Citizen (i.e., the justice system needs to take responsibility for their actions).  To make Clyde look like he's in the moral high ground, despite his endless hypocrisy, the writers made virtually every member of the justice department amoral, unfeeling a-holes.  Only innocent, uncorrupted Cindy breaks the mold of corrupt straw men, but oops!  She dies too, courtesy of a car bomb set up by Clyde.  And this accomplishes what, exactly?  This is the only way Rice will learn not to side with murderers.  Yes, that's right.  Clyde wants to teach a lesson to the attorney that he loathes the most by making everyone else around him expendable.  ""Jigsaw"" would be so proud.I'm all for debating the justice system's flaws, but it needs to be done in a reasonable way.  Like, for one, showing the entangling rules and regulations that would enable the less dignified actions of the justice department thrive.  It also helps to show a wide spectrum of laudable and seedy lawyers alike, or even show how some attorneys are stuck defending monsters like Darby because they have to, whether they like it or not. Do you know what show does this, in spite of occasional unrealism?  Law and Order.Strip out Law Abiding Citizen's hackneyed morality play, and only a risible vigilante film remains.  If that's what you want, more power to you.  But for the people championing this tripe as a much needed ""take that!"" to the justice system, I have two words for you: John Grisham.  Unlike the hacks who wrote this movie, Grisham actually has a law degree.",1,Implausible vigilante film with a duplicitous moral,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,5309,"['Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen',

1297864,A2XCQVAP1URA97,B002XMGGJM,Dddd,"[13, 20]","Hi All.  I saw ""Law Abiding Citizen last Night, Despite what I thought was a contrived ending (I guess it needed to end that way, but I did not think that would have been a realistic ending), I Was blown away by how good this movie actually is.  As an attorney, I can honestly say that there were some pretty accurate depictions of how it works in the profession.  First a comment.  Reading some of the negative reviews of the film, I am simply appalled at the lack of intelligence, and even moral fabric of some of the reviewers and their simple inability to follow a well thought out plot line, and terrific explanation as to how Mr. Butler was able to do what he did.  Whether it could have been pulled off or not is not the issue.  It is a reasonable and valid explanation for the plan that was put in place. ANd frankly it was ingenious.  He had many years to put it in place so how is that so impossible?Some of the positive and thoughtful reviews are spot on with the idea that this film, played excellently by Mr. Butler, deals intelligently with one (Suremely intelligent and gifted) man's reaction to a system he deems to be incredibly unjust.  And indeed, his reaction and plan (which would not be possible if he were not so resourceful and intelligent) to Prosecutors making deals to ensure convictions, while ignoring the barbarity of crimes committed is very realistic because prosecutors are by nature very political animals who get relected through things like high conviction rates.  They care little about actual victims of crimes, even though they probably did not start out that way. How many families of victims of crimes are left feeling helpless because the law did not help them, the law did not see their catastrophic pain as anything else than an opportunity to notch one more in the conviction belt.  this is probably why many people are convicted wrongly anyway. It's not often enough about justice being done. I t is more often, can I get a conviction as a prosecutor, despite whether your better sense tells you that this person is innocent or guilty.SPOLIERS AHEAD***********There are however prosecutors who do the right thing and would have taken this matter to trial to see ultimate justice done (even if the prosecutor had ultimately lost) simply because of the barbarity of the crimes against Mr. Butler and his family. That being said, even a conscientious proseutor may take a deal if a conviction if doubtful or hampered by police misconduct.  In this instance it may have been correct, as the DNA evidence taken was deemed to be inadmissible.  However, the idea that Mr. Butler, an eyewitness to what occurred, would somehow prove to be an unreliable witness is a stretch.  I  would have taken my chances with a jury convicting the criminals, and my chances with Clyde Shelton (Butler) as a witness. Mr. Butler's idealistic rant during his bail proceeding is very realistic in the sense of a layman who does not understand how the process works. The process itself is skewed in favor of defendants because the system is designed to limit the instances (even though it may not always work) where innocent people are convicted.  let's assume for a moment, that Mr. butler was set up by someone else for the crimes he was alleged to have committed, then the judge revoking his bail, even though he was innocent would have been harsh and unfair- an innocent man sitting in prison until his trial.  That is a terrible in its own right.  It is such a difficult thing to combine a desire to see justice done against criminals versus making sure we do not convict the innocent.  Thus, the judge, assuming all men to be innocent until proven guilty should have given him an opportunity at bail despite the horrificness of the crimes he was alleged to have committed. IN this instance, the judge was right and Mr. Butler was wrong but how can you blame a lay person and the victim of a horrific crime (as he was) for hating the very system that lets someone who did what they did to his family serve less than 5 years in prison. You can't blame him.  I would lose my mind if what happened to him happend to me.  I would have wanted to kill everyone, in the most barbaric of ways. That's what makes this movie so excellent is because it deals with such important and difficult issues.Other comments.SPOLIERS AHEAD **********The ingenius maneuvers by Mr. Butler were amazing to watch and the come uppance received by at least one of the criminals is the single greatest come uppance that I have seen on film.  Unflinchly unforgiving, and I Loved it.but I have some  questions for the educated and well read viewers who watched this film.  MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN FILM.  I REPEAT.  DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN FILM.I believe the ending was entirely contrived for several reasons.  It is unlikely that Mr. Butler's plan would have been discovered by Mr. Foxx in a timely fashion even with the information he obtained. It is clear that Mr. butler having planned so ingeniously would have made his secret location failry impenetrable by anyone but him either through the use of digital codes, retinal scanners what have you, in order to gain acess to his lair.  Assuming for a moment that we accept that Mr. Foxx realistically came upon this information and discovered the plan by any means necessary, then the movie ends completely unrealistically because Mr. Foxx, the Judge, and the police officer broke various laws in finding out his plan, and violated Mr. butler's civil rights in the process.  So even if the they were able to stop Butler from carrying out his plan, it is very likely that Mr. Foxx, and all involved would have been removed as ADA, Judge and cop and would have been disbarred, and probably prosecuted for crimes.  How about the instances where Mr. Butler is asaulted by Mr. Foxx.  Foxx would have been charged with Assault and lost his job (even though he may have been doing what's right, he still broke the laws and would need to be hald accountable). This would have been a true ending, because if every one must be held accountable, then Mr. Foxx, even though he saves the day (Where he deserved execution in my opinion), should be held accountable for breaking a mutitude of laws in stopping.  Anyone can get any result they want if they are willing to ignore the constituion that protects liberties.  That's why we have the protections in the first place.  So if you violate those liberties, even to save lives, then guess what- you have to pay the piper as a result.That is the price that one has to pay for doing things outside the law even when the result saves lives.  How come only Gerard Butler's character has to be held accountable for breaking the law to obtain justice when no one else would do what they were supposed to do.  Why is that he alone has to pay the price for takinjg the law into his own hands.  Why is his life and the lives of his wife and child less in the eyes of Mr. Foxx and co, than the lives of Foxx's colleagues.  Why is Mr. Foxx not held accountable, after breaking the laws to stop Butler? The appropriate ending, based on what actually happened would have been Mr. Foxx's daughter and wife at the daughter's recital, after Foxx saves the day, but he himself would have been either a jailed or disbarred attorney for his actions in getting there.  There is a price to pay for these actions, despite the result.My question to you, is do you agree with my thoughts on this?Finally, the more realistic ending would have been for Mr. butler to pull the whole thing off (executing everyone even remotely connected with the prosecution of these defendants) and then walk out of his prison through his secret way, which I won't reveal, and disappear into the sea of humanity.  I just do not think that he would have been caught.  This would have satisfied me alot more, and made this movie an all time great in my opinion.  But then again, this may be more to do with my desire for vengeance on his behalf then any clear cut logical thinking.

1297870,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B002XMGGJM,D. Hartley,"[14, 28]","Basically, I am a man of peace. But I do love me a nice, cathartic, revenge fantasy every now and then (helps to get rid of the bad thoughts). After all, it's been a popular meme in cinema, from Tod Browning's silent ""Revenge"" (1918) to Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" saga. Call it what you will-tit for tat, squaring accounts, settling the score, quid pro quo-the desire for reciprocity runs deep in our DNA.That being said, there are different grades of revenge flicks. When I say that I enjoy the odd revenge fantasy, I'm thinking along the lines of film narratives where the antagonist gets their ""just desserts"", just not necessarily involving bloodletting (but still served up nice and cold). Examples? ""Wall Street"", ""Michael Clayton"", ""The Politician's Wife"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"" (OK, that involved some bloodletting-but I think you get my point).Then you have revenge films in the ""put your brain on hold"" category like ""Law Abiding Citizen"", a star vehicle for Beefcake du Jour, Gerard Butler (who also produced), which has plenty o' bloodletting. Butler is an ""ordinary citizen"" (uh-huh) named Clyde Shelton (we'll address the ""law-abiding"" part of the equation shortly). The filmmakers, in their eagerness to plunge the audience headfirst into the squishy viscera of righteous retribution, jump right to it while the opening credits are still warm. Clyde, appearing to be a mild-mannered inventor-tinkerer type, is enjoying a Hallmark evening at home with his lovely wife and adorable little girl (obviously, they're doomed). Enter a trailer-trash variation on Alex and his droogs, a pair of hygienically-challenged home invaders who wreak mayhem on the family, leaving Clyde maimed and his wife and daughter dead.Fast-forward to the trial, where assistant D.A. Nick Rice (a somnambulant Jamie Foxx) is directed by his superiors to negotiate a reduced sentence plea bargain for one of the murderers in exchange for damning testimony against his accomplice (much to Clyde's chagrin). Fast-forward another 10 years; the killer who sang is released from the joint, while his ex-partner sits on Death Row. Rice gets a disturbing visit from Clyde, who has become a somewhat ominous and brooding fellow in the interim. When the freed killer soon turns up murdered, Clyde does everything imaginable to implicate himself as prime suspect, short of making a legally admissible confession, and is soon in jail (where he actually wants to be-for reasons that are so far-fetched that it is hardly worth explaining).From this point forward, the narrative begins to hemorrhage logic from the gaping holes in a clich&eacute;-riddled script, as Clyde turns into a cartoonish Bond villain who is somehow able to hold the entire city of Philadelphia hostage to his whims...from his jail cell. Frankly, what I found profoundly disturbing about the film is that it is loosely dressed up as a polemic about our broken justice system, when in reality it is an almost unbelievably reactionary piece of torture porn, somewhere between ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan's reimagining of ""justice"" as a one-man court system and the Gospel according to Jack Bauer. Yes, I would agree that there are problems with our criminal justice system, but I am not so sure that vigilantism, assassinating judges, blowing up federal buildings...well, basically engaging in domestic terrorism is the best message to put out there as to how we might go about reforming it. The biggest ""injustice"" of all? Hollywood continues to get away with churning out this offal. Oh well, I guess there's no use getting myself all riled up.

They stab Shelton, rape and kill his wife, and abduct, and subsequently kill, his daughter. One of the villains, Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte), is the main perpetrator; the other, Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart), largely stands and watches. Shelton survives the attack and the perpetrators are eventually caught. In the U.S. `plea bargaining' system, Darby blames Ames for the atrocities, so gets a much lighter sentence while Ames - who participated little in the attack - gets the death penalty. Shelton is appalled that either of the perpetrators should get away virtually unpunished, so he sets out to take his own revenge. He tampers with the lethal injection so that Ames dies an excruciatingly painful death - cruel and unusual punishment indeed. He poses as a policeman to `arrest' Darby once he is released and then chops him up into pieces - slowly. Lead investigator Nick Rice knows who is to blame for Darby's death and Shelton is quite easily arrested. We are less than half-way through the story at this point - then it gets really interesting. Steadily, Shelton eliminates all the people responsible for letting Darby go free. In the end, Rice has to abandon his principles to eliminate Shelton.

Well, I'd consider this  to be a gripping and provocative movie, but one that's badly flawed, mainly in the story. The acting, photography and sound track are all good. If the story, as it unfolds, doesn't bother you, then you may find it to be an excellent movie to watch.The movie opens with a truly gristly scene. A family man, Gerard Butler, undergoes an unprovoked and brutal attack in his home and it results in the death of his beautiful wife and his pretty young daughter as well as severely wounding him. It's one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in the movies and you may not care to watch it. Just be forewarned, at least. In any case, the perpetrators are caught and tried, but Butler doesn't feel that the punishment fits the crime and feels that the prosecutor was more interested in advancing his own career goals rather than finding justice. Okay, I'm sure there are lot's of cases like this in our murky criminal justice system. I'm also sure that most of the movie audience would agree with Butler's feelings.From this point on, Butler carries out his own personal system of justice to inflict the pain and suffering on the two murderers that he, his wife and child had experienced. An eye for an eye, so to speak. The results became increasingly gory. He's quickly rounded up by the law, with Jamie Foxx in the role of the lead prosecutor. However, keeping the clever Butler in captivity proved to be difficult. Things kept happening out in the real world while Butler remained safely in jail. It seems the man was much more clever than anyone had expected. In my opinion, this was where the story began to go wrong. The things Butler was able to do from within prison began to ring less and less believable, until, finally, the whole story just turned to nonsense unless you have the type of mind that can just go along with almost anything.

Gary Gary keeps the momentum of the story going along at a breakneck pace.  Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) opens his home door to face two thugs who beat and kill his wife and daughter and injure him substantially.  Shelton seeks a good lawyer and finds himself in the hands of smarty guy Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) who sets the film in motion by accepting a plea bargain on behalf of the killers - one will be sent to prison with the death penalty and the other just gets a little time. Shelton is distraught at this abuse of the justice game. Jump forward 10 years and the one killer has a botched heinous execution while the other, now free, is is laughtered hideously - both by Shelton.  There is a plan in Shelton's head to destroy everyone who allowed justice to misfire and the rest of the film is how the genius mind of Shelton (jailed after his slaughter of the killer) manages to wipe out everyone involved in the court system that instigated the terror.Butler and Foxx make a good sparring pair and there are some excellent cameos by Colm Meany, Viola Davis, Bruce McGill et al.  Yes, this is a violent film, and not for the squeamish, but it does make us look at the judicial system with different eyes.

But it turned out to be compelling, thought-provoking, and just plain entertaining.You know the plot. The critics called this ""a nasty piece of work"" and so on. Well, there is nastiness. But it's not just the violence (most of which is off-screen and implied). It's the nastiness of the justice system. This is the movie version of ""The Death of Common Sense"" - the criminal-friendly, evidence-killing justice system that allows murderers and rapists to go free based on technicalities, forcing prosecutors to make deals to gain silly ""wins"" is the ""broken"" aspect on display here. Any sane person can readily see the two warring sides of this coin, as shown in the movie - the injustice of the system and the workarounds necessary. By the end of the movie, no-one's worried about Clyde's civil rights anymore - the lesson he intends to teach. (And how he does it is a doozie.)Despite the fact that his agenda spills over into semi-innocent blood, I found myself rooting for Clyde the whole way through. This is what made the critics queasy - they found themselves rooting for him too, despite their criminal-friendly, respect-their-rights-above-all-else sensibilities. (Well, unless they're the victims, in which case we often find they're hiding guns in every corner of their own houses. See Carl Rowan, et al.) Because the ""innocent"" victims also knew that they had, in some measure, brought this on themselves. Is it unfair? Perhaps; but then again, they were just working within the crazy ""progressive"" justice system. The question the movie asks is, when do they start respecting the rights of the victims more? (I don't mean the race-driven travesties of the Tawana Brawley or the lacrosse cases.)The anti-Bush, anti-Catholic-church guy who flew his plane into an IRS building (oops, didn't your newspaper give you that information?) is another disturbing example. Although we are repulsed by his final act, reading his screed we can certainly be digusted with a system (in this case the IRS and Mr. Moynihan) that can arbitrarily continually crush a hard-working engineer just trying to get the same breaks that Timothy Geithner and his peers do.These are disturbing questions that should not arise in the minds of ""regular"" folk like us.

There is not an unsuspenseful and undramatic moment. Two men push their way into the home of a brilliant government employee (Gerard Butler) in Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, and one of them repeatedly stabs his wife and kills his child. The prosecutor (Jamie Foxx) insists that he must make a deal with the killer because he is afraid that he might otherwise loose his case. The killer agreed to testify against his accomplice if he only has to serve five years in jail. Butler demands that Foxx not do this especially because the man who will serve the relatively small jail sentence is the actual killer. Foxx refuses. Ten years later the accomplices is executed, but not as all expected. Butler changed the ingredients used to execute the man and he died a very violent and painful death. And this was only the first of Butler's many revenge murders. He captures the actual killer who invaded his home and violently kills him over a long period of time with painful injections of chemicals and by cutting up his body into twenty-five pieces while he was conscious.Foxx finds learns from a man who worked with Butler that Butler is a brilliant man who the government used to kill people from a distance so that no one could prove who did the murder. He has the skill to anticipate how people will act, and he used that skill in developing the methods of murder. He never did anything he did not think out before hand. Thus, the chances of Foxx defeating him were very slim.Butler allows himself to be arrested. He kills his cell mate and is placed in solitary confinement. ""He is in jail because he wants to be in jail. Don't think that he killed his cell mate for no reason,"" the man who worked with Butler warns Foxx. ""You can't stop him unless you put a bullet in his head."" While in solitary confinement, he murders many more people. He kills the lawyer who represented the man who murdered his family and he kills the judge. Then he blows up the cars of the lawyers and staff who worked at the District Attorney's Office, except for Foxx and his boss, the DA. Then he kills the DA and the police who are guarding him. ""Everyone,"" Butler tells Foxx, ""must be accountable for their actions. I'm going to bring the whole f...g system down. It's going to be biblical."" Foxx and others wonder if he has an accomplice. The mayor closes down Philadelphia to protect its inhabitants and has armed guards placed on the streets.Viewers will sit in suspense watching all of this and how it is done. They will wonder if Foxx can find out if there is an accomplice and, if not, how does Butler commit the murders from solitary confinement, and can Foxx stop him, and will Foxx learn what Butler wants to teach him, and will Foxx resort to non-legal methods to stop him.",5,"This is undoubtedly one of the best ""revenge films""",1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,3083,"['undoubtedly', 'one', 'best', 'revenge', 'films', 'even', 'revenger', 'not', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'only', 'society', 'learn', 'abide', 'law.The', 'revenge', 'plot', 'result', 'ten', 'years', 'meticulous', 'planning', 'excellent', 'acting', 'superb', 'so', 'too', 'are', 'gimmicks', 'not', 'unsuspenseful', 'undramatic', 'moment', 'Two', 'men', 'push', 'way', 'home', 'brilliant', 'government', 'employee', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Philadelphia', 'city', 'brotherly', 'love', 'one', 'repeatedly', 'stabs', 'wife', 'kills', 'child', 'prosecutor', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'must', 'make', 'deal', 'killer', 'afraid', 'might', 'otherwise', 'loose', 'case', 'killer', 'agreed', 'testify', 'accomplice', 'only', 'serve', 'five', 'years', 'jail', 'Butler', 'Foxx', 'not', 'do', 'especially', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'serve', 'relatively', 'small', 'jail', 'sentence', 'actual', 'killer', 'Foxx', 'Ten', 'years', 'later', 'accomplices', 'executed', 'not', 'expected', 'Butler', 'changed', 'ingredients', 'used', 'execute', 'man', 'died', 'very', 'violent', 'painful', 'death', 'was', 'only', 'first', 'Butler', 'many', 'revenge', 'murders', 'actual', 'killer', 'who', 'invaded', 'home', 'violently', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'painful', 'injections', 'chemicals', 'cutting', 'up', 'body', 'twenty-five', 'pieces', 'was', 'conscious.Foxx', 'finds', 'man', 'who', 'worked', 'Butler', 'Butler', 'brilliant', 'man', 'who', 'government', 'used', 'kill', 'people', 'distance', 'so', 'one', 'could', 'prove', 'who', 'did', 'murder', 'skill', 'anticipate', 'how', 'people', 'will', 'act', 'used', 'skill', 'developing', 'methods', 'murder', 'never', 'did', 'anything', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'out', 'hand', 'Thus', 'chances', 'Foxx', 'defeating', 'were', 'very', 'slim.Butler', 'be', 'arrested', 'cell', 'mate', 'placed', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'jail', 'be', 'jail', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'killed', 'cell', 'mate', 'reason', 'man', 'who', 'worked', 'Butler', 'Foxx', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'put', 'bullet', 'head', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'many', 'more', 'people', 'lawyer', 'who', 'represented', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'family', 'judge', 'Then', 'up', 'cars', 'lawyers', 'staff', 'who', 'worked', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Office', 'Foxx', 'boss', 'DA', 'Then', 'DA', 'police', 'who', 'are', 'guarding', 'Everyone', 'Butler', 'Foxx', 'must', 'be', 'accountable', 'actions', ""'m"", 'going', 'bring', 'whole', 'f', 'g', 'system', 'down', 'going', 'be', 'biblical', 'Foxx', 'others', 'wonder', 'accomplice', 'mayor', 'down', 'Philadelphia', 'protect', 'inhabitants', 'armed', 'guards', 'placed', 'streets.Viewers', 'will', 'sit', 'suspense', 'watching', 'how', 'done', 'will', 'wonder', 'Foxx', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'accomplice', 'not', 'how', 'Butler', 'commit', 'murders', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'can', 'Foxx', 'stop', 'will', 'Foxx', 'learn', 'what', 'Butler', 'teach', 'will', 'Foxx', 'resort', 'non-legal', 'methods', 'stop']",N/A

The last few years, we've seen this a lot with films like THE BRAVE ONE and DEATH SENTENCE. The problem that these films usually face is they treat it either too realistically, or not realistically enough. In the case of LAW ABIDING CITIZEN, it's starts one way and then falls way too far in the other direction.The opening is very realistic and very brutal with the home invasion sequence and the preliminaries to the action, as Foxx does his legal dealings with the devil and Butler deals with the anger and frustration of watching the real killer of his family get a lesser sentence, and it does show promise for the remainder of the film. But once Butler's plan goes into motion, that's when the film really starts to go off the rails. Butler, who is an actor that I really admire, gets to have a lot of fun with this role, but it's not a role that he should be having fun with. His character turns inexplicably from vengeance-seeking father and husband to evil genius in a very short period of screen time. And Foxx's character is so unbearably cocky and smarmy that it's very difficult to root for him, even when Butler's character has done some really evil stuff. And the fact that Butler's character is so much more than he seems to be... it's just a horrible deus ex machina and it's a really hacky premise. He can't just be a normal angry man; he has to be a former government assassin.If they decided to make Butler the hero of this film and maybe give the film a PUNISHER-like angle where the people that he's killing are truly corrupt and evil, and Foxx's character was maybe someone who was caught in the middle of all this insanity... Well, that is a film that would make for a more entertaining and satisfying watch. Alas, they took another road, and it's a road that starts in a world of plausibility and forks off so far into ridiculousness that the film ultimately implodes on itself.F. Gary Gray isn't known much for his thought-provoking films, and is much more of the fast-paced, blow-stuff-up school. THE NEGOTIATOR with Sam Jackson and Kevin Spacey is as close as he's gotten to making a very watchable film, and unfortunately, Butler and Foxx are not Spacey and Jackson.The worst thing about this film is that it really doesn't even seem to have a point. It's just a good premise turned into a bad film.",1,"Some interesting moments, but falls too far too fast.",1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,2513,"['LAW', 'ABIDING', 'CITIZEN', 'film', 'long-standing', 'trend', 'how', 'ineffective', 'justice', 'system', 'how', 'people', 'find', 'necessary', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'last', 'few', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'films', 'BRAVE', 'ONE', 'DEATH', 'SENTENCE', 'problem', 'films', 'usually', 'face', 'treat', 'either', 'too', 'realistically', 'not', 'realistically', 'enough', 'case', 'LAW', 'ABIDING', 'CITIZEN', 'one', 'way', 'then', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'other', 'direction.The', 'opening', 'very', 'realistic', 'very', 'brutal', 'home', 'invasion', 'sequence', 'preliminaries', 'action', 'Foxx', 'legal', 'dealings', 'devil', 'Butler', 'deals', 'anger', 'frustration', 'watching', 'real', 'killer', 'family', 'get', 'lesser', 'sentence', 'show', 'promise', 'remainder', 'film', 'once', 'Butler', 'plan', 'motion', 'when', 'film', 'really', 'go', 'off', 'rails', 'Butler', 'who', 'actor', 'really', 'admire', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'role', 'not', 'role', 'should', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'character', 'inexplicably', 'vengeance-seeking', 'father', 'husband', 'evil', 'genius', 'very', 'short', 'period', 'screen', 'time', 'Foxx', 'character', 'so', 'unbearably', 'cocky', 'smarmy', 'very', 'difficult', 'root', 'even', 'when', 'Butler', 'character', 'done', 'really', 'evil', 'stuff', 'fact', 'Butler', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'be', 'just', 'horrible', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'really', 'hacky', 'premise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'normal', 'angry', 'man', 'be', 'former', 'government', 'decided', 'make', 'Butler', 'hero', 'film', 'maybe', 'give', 'film', 'PUNISHER-like', 'angle', 'where', 'people', 'killing', 'are', 'truly', 'corrupt', 'evil', 'Foxx', 'character', 'was', 'maybe', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'caught', 'middle', 'insanity', 'Well', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'entertaining', 'satisfying', 'watch', 'Alas', 'took', 'road', 'road', 'world', 'plausibility', 'forks', 'off', 'so', 'far', 'ridiculousness', 'film', 'ultimately', 'itself.F', 'Gary', 'Gray', ""n't"", 'known', 'much', 'thought-provoking', 'films', 'much', 'more', 'fast-paced', 'blow-stuff-up', 'school', 'NEGOTIATOR', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'as', 'close', 'gotten', 'making', 'very', 'watchable', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'Butler', 'Foxx', 'are', 'not', 'Spacey', 'Jackson.The', 'worst', 'thing', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'have', 'point', 'just', 'good', 'premise', 'turned', 'bad', 'film']",N/A

Then again, when you've been planning vengeance for ten years and have studied in all that time, what can one do besides exacting that plan? Ask Clyde, who's trying to get his late wife's rapist/child's murderer to be legally dead. Problem is, with the way the judicial system is, he could get away, and he knows it. So, after taking the law into his own hands, things play out precisely as he expects them to, including him being thrown into jail and having court procedures and hearings and getting called a &#34;criminal&#34; with no one giving a second thought about the cause behind his motive. But even in the courtroom does Clyde's guile play out effectively.Throughout a whole process of exacting vengeance for his wife and daughter, he comes up with cruelly inventive ways of killing key people and &#34;pawns&#34; off, manipulating things to show &#34;lessons&#34; of what happens when people don't do things the precise way he requests them to be. And none of it is for the faint of stomach nor heart.Though it's called &#34;Unrated Director's Cut,&#34; it could also be called the &#34;Original NC-17&#34; edition since it was threatened to be that rating if they didn't shave some of the violence out. They did, as well as have additional dialogue (some comical, some just because) and things that may have improved the story, but only slightly, just to give slightly more personality to key characters.This was a great film to have, but only watch if you can handle the extremely disturbing violent content and can handle the language used,or can handle certain shocking death sequences.

The product is the immensely enjoyable action thriller Law Abiding Citizen.When wealthy engineer Gerard Butler sees his family murdered as he lay helpless on the ground, anguish and pain rule his life. His lawyer, assistant DA Jamie Foxx, is a slick winner known for an extraordinarily high conviction percentage. Against his wishes, Foxx brokers a deal in exchange for testimony from one of the criminals. Predictably, the scumbag goes free early, and Butler is beside himself with disbelief when he sees his lawyer talking to the rat. Rather than go all ""Time to Kill"" on everyone, Butler decides to let the pot simmer deep inside. Fast forward ten years, and Foxx - now one step away from being the DA - must deal with a rich and vengeful Butler who has boiled over with rage at his misgivings with the U.S. legal system.This is one of those movies perfect for viewers who shut their brains off, or for those who must question everything. For the former, there is nonstop action, plotting, and awesome revenge that rivals the best vigilante justice ever seen. Butler is perfectly calculating, displaying what a resourceful person can do with no other true goal in life but to exact revenge and pain upon those who have caused harm. For the latter, it's an introspective look at crime, prosecution, and justice. Regardless of aspects that may be a little difficult to believe - but not quite Armageddon unbelievable - it definitely causes a viewer to evaluate the justice system flaws...while enjoying the Butler's wisecracks and richly deserved revenge that every family member who has suffered through something like the actions of this movie's killers.From top to bottom this is a very entertaining movie. It's not all explosions and shock scenes, nor is it a snoozefest. With great directing and acting, a concept with which most people can support, and a clever ending that is fair considering the protagonist dichotomy, it's easy to root for each side of justice, and each character's goal. And if that is possible, then the point being made in this film is successful.

Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is the prosecutor who, in order to maintain his high prosecution rate of 96%, strikes a plea bargain that shocks and angers Clyde.  The thug who orchestrated the home invasion, Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte), only receives a few years in prison while his partner, Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart), is given the death penalty.Ten years later, Ames is being prepped for lethal injection, which is suppose to be painless.  However, chemicals are switched and his death is horrifyingly gruesome.  Darby is abducted and slowly tortured to death by having his limbs amputated without anesthesia.  Shelton is arrested for the murders and imprisoned.  Somehow he is able to continue killing everyone associated with the case.  Once a law abiding citizen, Shelton is determined to teach Nick that you should never make deals with murderers.Expertly directed by F. Gary Gray and beautifully filmed in Philadelphia, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is the best vigilante justice film I've seen since Charles Bronson starred in ""Death Wish.""  Gerard Butler and Jamie Fox head a stellar cast that had a great time working together on this film as evidenced by the commentary provided by producers Lucas Foster and Alan Siegel.Gerard Butler, superstar of such megahits as ""300"" and ""P.S. I Love You,"" gives a very convincing performance as a loving family man whose obsession for vengeance drives him to insanity.  Initially, I, along with many others, sympathized with Clyde's plight; I even cheered him on as he killed Ames and Darby.  However, the killing soon got out of hand and Clyde was quickly transformed from hero to villain.Jamie Foxx (""In Living Color"" television series) and Regina Hall (""Scary Movie"" franchise) greatly surprised me.  I must admit to having never seen either one of them in a thriller.  Like Gerard Butler, both of them are well rounded performers.  Foxx's character, Nick, began as a type of self centered, materialistic villain who cared more about his success rate than the personal feelings of his clients.  To him, they were only statistics.  However, Nick undergoes a transformation while struggling to prevent Clyde from claiming more victims.  He lives to regret having made deals with the men responsible for slaughtering Clyde's wife and daughter.Anchor Bay Entertainment has released a wonderful DVD presentation for ""Law Abiding Citizen.""  It has an anamorphic widescreen presentation of 2:40:1 that looks superb on a high definition television.  Subtitles have been provided for those of us who are deaf and hearing impaired.  There are some interesting special features that are essential viewing.  The most frightening one to me is ""The Justice of Law Abiding Citizen.""  It actually provides the loop holes (Felony Murder Rule, Exclusionary Rule and the Plea Deal) that made it possible for Darby to testify against Ames who received the death penalty even though it was Darby who committed the actual murders.  Forensic evidence and eyewitness testimony are also discussed in regards to how they can be perverted in order to free a suspect.Trailers were provided for several movies:  ""The Crazies"" - a remake of George Romero's classic horror film; ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" - a comedy of psychic experimentation starring George Clooney, Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges; Michael Moore's documentary ""Capitalism: A Love Story;"" and the bloody and erotic ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand.""If you enjoy watching vigilante justice films, then I highly recommend watching ""Law Abiding Citizen.""  It is a gritty, violent, emotional thriller that is quite provocative.  It asks the question:  ""How far will you go to avenge the murder of a loved one?""  It makes the viewer wonder how unjust our justice system really is.  One thing is certain, Nick will never again make deals with murderers.Joseph B.

1297917,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B002XMGGJM,Jem,"[2, 3]","When I saw this film advertised for theatres, I thought it was an action film.  I don't think it was marketed well.  Law Abiding Citizen goes way beyond action, though it does have some explosive sequences.  It's actually more of a noir thriller, with many plot twists and unexpected diversions.  It had many elements that reminded me of films like Phone Booth, Die Hard With a Vengeance and even Speed.  The trailer made it out as a simple criminal versus a virtuous DA, but it's much deeper than that.  Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler are playing a deadly game against one another, and there is no black and white.  Butler's character is supposedly ""the villain,"" but one that is so easy to sympathize with, even justified in his actions. The film really highlights many of the problems in our criminal justice system, lending the story credibility and realism.  The plot kept me guessing as to just how Butler was accomplishing his objectives.  However, I do think the ending could have been better.  After so much clever cat and mouse, the climax was too simple and didn't live up to what came before.  Overall though, it was an exciting film that kept me paying close attention and on the edge of my seat.  Also, the acting from the two leads was top notch, and even the supporting cast was noticeably superb.The DVD has some well done extras, including featurettes on special effects shots and behind the scenes.  However, the best featurette discusses the law behind the film.  Experts explain the actual statutes that impact the characters in the film and how they are realistically played out in the story.  It added a lot to the film, basing the plot on more than than just getting off on ""a technicality.""  The extras add to the film experience.

1297922,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B002XMGGJM,J. Michael Click,"[4, 6]","""Law Abiding Citizen"" could - and should - have been a much better film than it is.  It starts out promisingly enough, with Gerard Butler playing a family man who is stabbed and whose wife and daughter are butchered during a dramatic home invasion and robbery.  Enter Jamie Foxx as the ambitious Philadelphia prosecutor who is more concerned with preserving his conviction rate that with serving justice.  Without Butler's consent, Foxx accepts a plea bargain from the actual murderer in exchange for the killer's (false) testimony against his partner in crime.Flash forward ten years later.  The condemned man's execution doesn't go as planned, and the actual murderer is brutally butchered.  All leads point to Butler, who is apprehended and imprisoned on suspicion of taking the law into his own hands.  Butler even confesses.  But during his incarceration, other people who were involved in the decade-old case also begin to die in gruesome fashion.  Foxx, who has worked his way up in the D.A.'s office, soon catches on that Butler is wreaking his revenge from behind bars.  But who is helping him?  And why?  And how?It's at this critical point that the movie begins to fall apart, and the plot unravels.  It begins to be easy to tell who the next character to die is going to be (once you question the wisdom of Foxx's original bargain, you are very likely toast), and holes in the story begin to widen into canyons.  The film finally begins to collapse under the weight of its own moral ambiguity.  At the end of this basically two-character movie, neither Butler nor Foxx truly has been redeemed ... one's life continues and one's life ends, but the resolution is emotionally unsatisfactory, leaving the audience feeling cheated, its sympathies thwarted.""Law Abiding Citizen"" features some bravura acting by Gerard Butler, a smooth performance by Jamie Foxx, and some excellent supporting turns by Viola Davis, Annie Corley, Bruce McGill, and Leslie Bibb.  It also has some spectacular action sequences, and moments of genuine suspense.  However, all these fine components cannot hide the inadequacies of Kurt Wimmer's script, which are not overcome by F.

What makes it a good movie is there is just the precise amount left to the viewer's imagination, and most of the details are presented outright.  Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler out did themselves, and served up performances that uniquely fit together as properly as I've seen in a long, long time.  I like movies that are almost predictable but not entirely, and I like it when the bad guy is easy enough to hate that you don't mind when he gets what he deserves because they are demonstrated to be heinous criminals beyond rehabilitation - those type of people need justice upon them regardless of where it comes from.  The technical prowess of this film's gadgetry is impressive although not altogether believable.  There is enough graphic violence and gore, but not overdone.  There is about the right amount of cussing.  The movie's message is easy to relate to and the viewer can't help but get caught up in it a little bit.  Now for the reason I can't give this a full 5 stars.  The ending is wrong, and justice isn't served.  This needed to be a series, and not crammed into a single movie, and the ending needed changed.  For the record, just because somebody wears a business suit and carries a briefcase doesn't make them honest, just, have integrity, practice the Golden Rule, be charitable when deserved and/or harsh where deserved, nor does that business suit make them correct.  But one thing this movie drives home more than any other point is that if you don't have a serious resource of money, you can't fight back and the bullies have nothing to fear.

DA Nick Rice makes a deal with one of the killers and he gets only a few years in prison while the other guy gets the death sentance.  Rice is repulsed by the deal he made, but he wants to keep his high conviction rate.Ten years later, the guy on death row is somehow given the wrong chemical and dies horribly in front of Rice and others there to watch his execution.  Then the other guy is found dismembered.  Everything points to Shelton.  He is arrested.  But the killings continue, as more of the people involved in the case die.  Rice races to figure out how Shelton is committing the crimes while locked up.  Who is helping him?I'm fan of action movies and have been for years.  They don't really surprise me much anymore.  But there is one moment in this one that shocked the hell out of me!  It is one of the death scenes and it comes out of nowhere.But the last third of the movie is so absolutely absurd that it kind of took away from the rest of the movie.  I don't care how rich you are, there is no way anyone could have set up the things that Shelton did.  It would be impossible.The acting is pretty good.  Gerard Butler does a good job, and is plainly enjoying the over the top role of Shelton.  Jamie Foxx is good as Rice, but he seemed pretty wooden, like he was doing the movie for the paycheck.

I nearly pulled the disk at that point, but I stuck it out and I'm glad I did.  It starts with peaceful home life, Gerard Butler with his daughter.  Next, the doorbell rings, and a pair of home invaders break in, stab him, kill and rape his wife (in that order) and then kill the daughter.  There, you know how it starts and you can skip the first five minutes.  Spare yourself.  Next, it appears to follow the standard revenge fantasy.  One criminal gets the death penalty, but the other escapes with a light sentence due to a fairly contrived DNA mixup and a set em free judge.  It is at the execution where this film sets itself apart.  Suffice it to say that the execution goes wrong, and the accomplice meets his grizzly fate shortly thereafter.  This leaves another 90 minutes after the revenge has been extracted.Butler then gets himself carted off to prison and it is there where he really starts to make life difficult for those who bungled the prosecution of the men who killed his family, elected officials, and the city of Philadelphia in general.Law Abiding Citizen is a taught and engrossing thriller with a point to make (and I'm being vague so as not to spoil the twists).  Unfortunately, it does go a bit overboard with the gore and violence, and I took away one star for the first five minutes.  We didn't need to see that.  They hit him with a bat.  He could have blacked out and woke to find his family killed.  We didn't have to go through it with him.  It lost another star for some of the contrivances in order to set up the twists.  Nevertheless, the contrivances are forgivable insofar as they lead to pretty good twists in the story.Give it a try (but skip the first five minutes).

In truth, it tries to emulate ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Seven"" and a few other films by being a mash-up of those films.  The result is less than the sum of its parts.The direction is by-the-numbers and uninspired.  The script is cliche-ridden and needs a few draft revisions to make it a little fresher.MAJOR leaps in logic, geography, and timing.  (So-and-so character is heading back to a certain location, but the person who left long after he did from the same location manages to beat him there too easily..., etc).This film was shot during a very cold Philadelphia winter, and in one dialogue scene shot on an interior staircase in a courthouse, there is visible steam coming from the actors' mouths.  Looks as if the movie crew was granted access to the building during off-hours or a weekend but didn't agree to pay to have the heat turned on.There were a few twists to the genre in this film, but I found out later they were (probably) borrowed from a certain Japanese thriller from a few years ago.  Is there NOTHING original anymore?One thing in particular that made me chuckle:  Fairly early on in the film I was having trouble understanding some of Jamie Foxx's spoken dialog because he tends to swallow his words.  So I watched the rest of the film with the subtitles on.  During a scene where Gerard Butler's character is playing music from his iPod, the subtitle reads ""[Jazz playing]"".  The music was not Jazz --  it was the song ""Eminence Front"" by The Who.  But as if that weren't funny enough, a few moments later, after the film has cut away to another location and then returned to the iPod playing, the subtitles then read ""[Funk playing]"", but it is still the SAME SONG playing!  I didn't know (and I bet The Who's Pete Townshend didn't either) that the first half of the rock song ""Eminence Front"" is Jazz and the second half is Funk.

Damn, when he strips naked, yes ladies he does strip naked in this movie, he looks pretty damn hot.  I don't care who points a finger at me and calls me gay, not that there is anything wrong with that.  I can now see why Gerard is linked to every woman in Hollywood.  I remember seeing PS, I Love You and the guy was just a normal bloke.  Now he is all buff and cut and stuff.  It almost makes me want to work out.  I did say almost so shut the hell up and stop laughing.The opening scene is a little disturbing so be warned.  Yes, I said it.  The guy who wrote the serial killer book, Duncan's Diary: Birth of a Serial Killer , just said an opening scene to a movie was disturbing.  I think the eerie part is how personally violent it was.  It seemed real.  It was vivid and close up and when the killings began it was slow and methodical.  It freaked me out a little.  The movie starts out like so many.  Clyde (Gerard Butler) is a normal dude at home with his family.  His wife is making dinner or washing dishes or something and Clyde is hanging out with his kid working.There is a knock on the door and Clyde answers it.  He is hit over the head with a bat, falls to the ground and his wife and child are murdered as he lays watching.  The robbers assume everyone is dead but Clyde survives.  The assistant DA (Jamie Foxx) plea bargains because that is they way our screwed up system works and the main perpetrator gets off with a couple years in prison.  He somehow pins the murders on the other guy.  Several years go by and Clyde builds up some royal constipation and at year ten, he explodes.He kills the robber first and then anyone and everyone who happened to be associated with the trial.

1297947,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B002XMGGJM,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[2, 3]","""Law Abiding Citizen"" is full of surprises from the get-go. Director Gary Gray immediately shows the crime in the opening segment. There is no doubt about the killers or what they have done. The husband (played by handsome Gerard Butler) is the living eyewitness to the crime: his wife and daughter are viciously murdered during a house invasion. He is left to die.Then come the opening credits. Ten years later Jamie Foxx (the assistant district attorney) has made a deal for one murderer to turn on the other to get at least one lethal injection, although the actual murderer is the one who turns. Clyde Shelton (Butler) has patiently waited for justice--as he is a law-abiding citizen. Yet the Fox move to put his wins up to 96% riles the moral marrow of Shelton's bones. Where is justice? What kind of legal system do we have? The viewer knows there are deals, dismissals, too much protective rights for criminals and not enough for victims. Justice begins to show her vigilante face. The turncoat dies viciously.So far the movie is believable. Viewers can even identify with the methods of vigilantism. Right is right (even when it is wrong). When the line goes far beyond blur to a reverse perversion, I, a whopping big Butler fan, must cry foul.Then the viewer learns the nature of Butler's work (not to be revealed here). Things make sense now. Law abiding? From whose viewpoint? Can justice be validated under such circumstances? Does Foxx play fair when he makes deals. He justifies his actions--and reasonably well. Granted, he follows the letter of the law, but what about that moral marrow?The question slips from the nature of justice to address the two men: Who is right? Who is wrong? Can a line be drawn in this circumstance? Ultimately, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" addresses the serious flaws in our justice system. The method may be beyond the Pale and in the realm of fantasy (method not to be revealed here), but this vehicle of thought provokes! It is obvious why the two lead actors chose their roles--to be part of an ongoing discussion of the nature of justice and how it can be obtained in a flawed society run by flawed people.Law Abiding Citizen.

That question is the driving force behind the newest action thriller from director F. Gary Gray (""Four Brothers""), ""Law Abiding Citizen"", starring Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx.""Law Abiding Citizen"" is the story of a family man named Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) whose entire life is torn apart when his wife and young daughter are brutally murdered in front of him. Seeking justice through the legal system, Clyde is shocked when he learns that up-and-coming Philadelphia prosecutor, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) has cut a deal with one of the killers in order to get a confession and heftier sentence for the other offender. Ten years pass by, and mysteriously the two killers are murdered and Clyde is more than happy to confess to their grisly deaths. However, their deaths were only the beginning as Clyde issues an ultimatum that will shake Philadelphia and its arrogant prosecutor to their core.When the premise of a movie is an attempt to right the wrongs of the legal system, what are the chances that the movie remains realistic? By my estimation, the likelihood of such an absurdly sounding concept for a movie succeeding is slim to none. Surprisingly, this twisted morality tale written by Kurt Wimmer (""Equilibrium"") never becomes an exercise in absurdity, although there are a few moments where one does begin to wonder if it might.Assisting in keeping the film on track is the fact that the story moves along at a brisk pace. Thus, the audience is never really allowed time to fully contemplate the semi-ridiculous nature of the premise. I mean are we really going to believe that one man can change the legal system, seriously? Besides that the characters are very well written, effectively gaining your interest from the very beginning. The two leads alone provide some very entertaining verbal sparring sessions throughout the duration. If the characters hadn't been handled in such a captivating and true-to-life manner then I doubt the story could have succeeded in remaining grounded in some semblance of reality.Of course, what would an action thriller be without great action sequences? Well, it would be rather boring, obviously. The action set pieces in this film are so elaborately designed, with great attention to detail, that you can't help but be impressed by the sheer creativity on display. The ingenuity within these scenes made the movie even more engaging for me. Had the action been handled in a lazy manner, resulting in a run-of-the-mill series of explosions or gunfights, the movie would have quickly begun to lose its appeal. After all, who wants to see the same old crap over and over again? Certainly not me, but that's what so many of these action movies tend to throw at us, but thankfully ""Law Abiding Citizen"" does not fall prey to this particular pratfall.Bringing the mayhem to life is Hollywood's current reigning ""It"" guy, Gerard Butler (""300""). With his character of Clyde Shelton, Gerard could have easily made the mistake of going overboard with the anger and aggression. If that had happened then Clyde would have become more of an insulting caricature of a man consumed by his hatred and grief; instead, he remains relatively low-key throughout, thus keeping him relatable. It's a testament to Gerard's acting ability that despite all the carnage his character has wrought, you still sympathize with the man and in a twisted way, root for him. That is a rare feat in movies, and one I'm surprised they achieved here.On the other side of the mayhem, is actor Jamie Foxx (""Collateral"") as hot-shot prosecutor Nick Rice. Jamie plays Rice with the appropriate blend of arrogance, caring, and determination. Jamie continues to deliver solid performances as an actor, and just like Gerard Butler's character, there are times you may find yourself surprised you're sympathizing with this man. Even though Nick's choices set many of the movie's events into motion, the story gives you ample time to understand his mindset, and as a result you find yourself rooting for him as well.I found it very strange that this movie was able to make me root for both of the lead characters throughout most of the film; especially with them being on opposing sides. It's not often when I see a movie that would leave me satisfied no matter the outcome, but ""Law Abiding Citizen"" manages to be one such movie.Featuring great performances, elaborately staged action set pieces, and a fast-moving, gritty storyline, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is a taut and intense thrill ride that will have you riveted from start to finish.""Law Abiding Citizen"" is rated R for

I hadn't even seen the trailer or read the back of the DVD case.  So the beginning five minutes came as a bit of a shock.  And the ten or fifteen minutes that followed helped elicit real viewer sympathy for what Gerard Butler's character was going through.  His helpless struggle against what seemed to be an ineffective and possibly even corrupt legal system (being represented by Jamie Foxx as Prosecutor, Nick Rice).  His sense of loss, and the resulting pain and frustration could have been enough to drive any man over the edge.But it is about that point in the movie that any viewer sympathy goes flying out the window, and Butler's character of Clyde Shelton begins to take on the role of antagonist to Foxx's Rice.  Following a ten year passage of time, Shelton re-emerges from obscurity to exact his revenge.  And not just by taking the law into his own hands.  He does that, of course, but so much more.  His vengeance is directed toward the very core of the legal system itself, and he apparently won't be satisfied until he brings the whole thing down.It's seemingly quite a startling turnaround for his character, until you learn part way through the movie that perhaps Shelton wasn't as innocent and blameless as originally portrayed.  Perhaps he was from a legal standpoint, but from a moral and ethical one, his background certainly comes into question.  You find out he is cold, calculating (to the nth degree), and totally, utterly ruthless. And absolutely everything he does serves his ultimate purpose.I believe that what knocks this movie down a notch or two in my estimation, is that it goes to the nth degree itself, and then takes it several steps further into the realm of the unbelievable.  Which makes for great Hollywood trash-film fodder, but ultimately lessens the overall credibility and impact of the film. Still, I enjoyed the movie.  It has several 'I can't believe what just happened' scenes that will leave you shaking your head.  But overall it ends up missing the mark, despite a well written script full of unexpected twists and turns.  What could have been an engrossing psychological cat and mouse game ends up being just another over-the-top, character driven revenge drama.

A law-abiding citizen, he turns to the Justice Department for help, but instead of Justice he gets Nick (Jamie Foxx) a slick Assistant District Attorney whose only motivation in life is maintaining his 96% conviction rate.Nick, seeing holes in Clyde's eyewitness case where there are none, and fearing his numbers might go down, does a deal with Darby, the actual murderer (who gets three years for hacking Clyde's wife and daughter into bloody little pieces) to send Darby's accomplice (who never touched them) to the Death House.Ten years go by, and Darby's accomplice is put to death by lethal injection. Something goes horrifically wrong, and the man dies screaming and writhing before a roomful of witnesses. At the same time, Nick's family gets a FedExed DVD of a man in a mask hacking Darby into, not coincidentally, little bloody pieces. Nick is such a self-absorbed law-and-order ass that he doesn't come home from work when his hysterical wife calls him, much less attends his Elementary School-aged daughter's first Cello recital.Clyde is arrested on suspicion of the deaths of the two miscreants, and is sent to jail without bail to await trial. While Clyde is in jail, people connected with the Darby verdict continue to die spectacularly (my favorite is the judge, who is shot through the head by her own cellphone).So begins LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, an F. Gary Gray film which, despite its action movie veneer, asks serious questions about the nature of justice and the justice system. There is nobody who doesn't agree that the system is a creaking monstrosity that doesn't work right. Just as in LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, overburdened or overly ambitious prosecutors make deals that mock the ideas of punishment and rehabilitation, the death penalty is wrongly sought (leading to acquittals) and applied (leading to miscarriages of justice), and ultimately justice is not done, either upon victims or upon the accused and/or convicted.LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN is about the right of the individual to ensure that justice be done. Neither Clyde nor Nick is particularly likeable here, and neither is entirely right nor wrong. The storyline is highly implausible anyway. But, like many other reviewers, I found myself very disappointed in the ending, where Nick finally outsmarts Clyde. This unsatisfactory ending costs LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN two stars (at least). It would have been far better had Clyde chosen the ending of this story, leaving the chastened Nick to gather lessons from amongst the ashes of his own self-righteousness.",3,"Vengeance?

1297968,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B002XMGGJM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","""Law Abiding Citizen"" is a thriller with a fairly unique twist in that the bad guy is already in prison when he gets serious about killing people.  The victim of a brutal home invasion, Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) has to watch as his wife and daughter are savagely murdered.  Then the American criminal justice system adds insult to injury when Philadelphia assistant district attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) decides to plead the case out, despite the protestations and outrage of Clyde.  The details justifying the plea bargain are rather nebulous, because the main idea is to set up the profound sense of injustice that will send Clyde off the deep end.  Even if Clyde's eye-witness testimony would be suspect in court, it is certainly enough for Nick to make sure that even if the letter of the law dictates that both criminals are equally culpable for the murders that the one Clyde insists did the actual killing is not the one who gets the better deal.  Certainly the D.A. can make the same deal with the other guy.  But the devil is not in the details here, so all that really matters is that Clyde sees Nick shaking hands with the scum of the earth who killed his family.  Once the prologue is ten years past, we get to the execution of the guy who got the short end of the deal and things go horribly wrong.  Then Nick uses a more direct approach to dispatch of the thug who did the actual killing, showing a flair worthy ofDanteorJigsaw.I would say that my problem with this 2009 film is that my sympathies are way more with Clyde than with Nick, but to tell the truth I did not mind rooting for Clyde, even though he is admittedly not in the same class as previous guilty pleasure bad guys likeRichard IIIandHannibal Lecter.  The main selling point of the movie is that you get caught up way more with ""what"" he is doing and ""how"" he is doing, especially since you already know the ""why.""  Each ""what"" is a fairly sophisticated way of disposing of the people on his hit list , while the ""how"" has to do with the fact that for most of the movie Clyde is not only in prison, but in solitary confinement.  Screenwriter Kurt Wimmer, who also wrote the script for the remake of ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" certainly knows how to come with elegant crimes, although this time around the goal is to kill people rather than steal paintings, and I like the explanation for how Clyde is able to do all that he does, once we finally get around to the origins of his peculiar set of skills.  Beyond that, Nick does not fit the bill as a worthy hero, not only because he is slow to catch on that people are dying because he is several moves behind in this killer chess game, but also because he fails to see himself as being culpable in any way, shape, or form for the gross injustice that set all of this in motion.  The more Nick stuck to his ""principles"" and refused to follow Clyde's instructions, the more I was actually hoping for an ironic ending where Nick literally feels Clyde's pain.  Director F. Gary Gray (""The Italian Job"") goes a bit over the top with the big ending, which really runs counter to the feel of the rest of the film, but that is probably what happens when the mandated ending is an attempt to balance the scales before the end credits.  After all, we cannot have somebody bringing down our criminal justice system, can we?  Consequently, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is one of those films where the journey is better than the final destination.This last paragraph is only for the eyes of those who have seen the film, so beware: there be spoilers here.  While watching this movie I was bothered by the whole idea that Clyde Shelton has an accomplice who works as the ""Mr. Outside"" counterpart to his ""Mr. Inside,"" simply because there are really no logical possibilities to who that might be.  A lot of times in movies you can figure out the surprise because there are only a limited number of possible suspects.  So I was pretty much convinced they were going to have to pull one out of left field, and was actually pleased when they avoided doing that.  However, I was less enamored with the convenient mistakes that Clyde made to allow Nick to put two and two together in the final reel.  I also understand why Nick was so slow to catch on to the fact that Clyde has already put everything in place before he made his first demand behind bars.  Of course, the more I think about this film the more flaws I find in it, even if they were not painfully apparent during my first viewing.  However, I find it interesting that most of my thoughts are about the few but key changes Clyde could have done to ensure his plan played out to its intended end.",4,Do not be surprised if your sympathies end up with the bad guy in this one,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,4670,"['Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'thriller', 'fairly', 'unique', 'twist', 'bad', 'guy', 'already', 'prison', 'when', 'serious', 'killing', 'people', 'victim', 'brutal', 'home', 'invasion', 'Clyde', 'Shelton', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'watch', 'wife', 'daughter', 'are', 'savagely', 'murdered', 'Then', 'American', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'insult', 'injury', 'when', 'Philadelphia', 'assistant', 'district', 'attorney', 'Nick', 'Rice', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'plead', 'case', 'out', 'protestations', 'outrage', 'Clyde', 'details', 'justifying', 'plea', 'bargain', 'are', 'rather', 'nebulous', 'main', 'idea', 'set', 'up', 'profound', 'sense', 'injustice', 'will', 'send', 'Clyde', 'deep', 'end', 'Even', 'Clyde', 'eye-witness', 'testimony', 'would', 'be', 'suspect', 'court', 'certainly', 'enough', 'Nick', 'make', 'sure', 'even', 'letter', 'law', 'criminals', 'are', 'equally', 'culpable', 'murders', 'one', 'Clyde', 'did', 'actual', 'killing', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'better', 'deal', 'Certainly', 'D.A', 'can', 'make', 'same', 'deal', 'other', 'guy', 'devil', 'not', 'details', 'here', 'really', 'matters', 'Clyde', 'Nick', 'shaking', 'hands', 'scum', 'earth', 'who', 'killed', 'family', 'Once', 'prologue', 'ten', 'years', 'past', 'get', 'execution', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'short', 'end', 'deal', 'things', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Then', 'Nick', 'more', 'direct', 'approach', 'dispatch', 'thug', 'who', 'did', 'actual', 'killing', 'showing', 'flair', 'worthy', 'ofDanteorJigsaw.I', 'would', 'say', 'problem', '2009', 'film', 'sympathies', 'are', 'way', 'more', 'Clyde', 'Nick', 'tell', 'truth', 'did', 'not', 'mind', 'rooting', 'Clyde', 'even', 'admittedly', 'not', 'same', 'class', 'previous', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'bad', 'guys', 'likeRichard', 'IIIandHannibal', 'Lecter', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'movie', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'way', 'more', 'what', 'doing', 'how', 'doing', 'especially', 'already', 'know', 'why', 'what', 'fairly', 'sophisticated', 'way', 'disposing', 'people', 'hit', 'list', 'how', 'do', 'fact', 'most', 'movie', 'Clyde', 'not', 'only', 'prison', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'Screenwriter', 'Kurt', 'Wimmer', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'remake', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'certainly', 'how', 'come', 'elegant', 'crimes', 'time', 'goal', 'kill', 'people', 'rather', 'steal', 'paintings', 'like', 'explanation', 'how', 'Clyde', 'able', 'do', 'once', 'finally', 'get', 'origins', 'peculiar', 'set', 'skills', 'Beyond', 'Nick', 'not', 'fit', 'bill', 'worthy', 'hero', 'not', 'only', 'slow', 'catch', 'people', 'are', 'dying', 'several', 'moves', 'killer', 'chess', 'game', 'also', 'see', 'being', 'culpable', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'gross', 'injustice', 'set', 'motion', 'more', 'Nick', 'stuck', 'principles', 'refused', 'follow', 'Clyde', 'instructions', 'more', 'was', 'actually', 'hoping', 'ironic', 'ending', 'where', 'Nick', 'literally', 'Clyde', 'pain', 'Director', 'F.', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'Italian', 'Job', 'bit', 'top', 'big', 'ending', 'really', 'counter', 'feel', 'rest', 'film', 'probably', 'what', 'when', 'mandated', 'ending', 'attempt', 'balance', 'scales', 'end', 'credits', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'somebody', 'bringing', 'down', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'can', 'Consequently', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'journey', 'better', 'final', 'destination.This', 'last', 'paragraph', 'only', 'eyes', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'beware', 'there', 'be', 'spoilers', 'here', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'bothered', 'whole', 'idea', 'Clyde', 'Shelton', 'accomplice', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Outside', 'counterpart', 'Mr', 'Inside', 'simply', 'are', 'really', 'logical', 'possibilities', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'lot', 'times', 'movies', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'surprise', 'are', 'only', 'limited', 'number', 'possible', 'suspects', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'convinced', 'were', 'going', 'have', 'pull', 'one', 'left', 'field', 'was', 'actually', 'pleased', 'when', 'avoided', 'doing', 'However', 'was', 'less', 'enamored', 'convenient', 'mistakes', 'Clyde', 'made', 'allow', 'Nick', 'put', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'final', 'reel', 'also', 'understand', 'why', 'Nick', 'was', 'so', 'slow', 'catch', 'fact', 'Clyde', 'already', 'put', 'everything', 'place', 'made', 'first', 'demand', 'bars', 'course', 'more', 'think', 'film', 'more', 'flaws', 'find', 'even', 'were', 'not', 'painfully', 'apparent', 'first', 'viewing', 'However', 'find', 'interesting', 'most', 'thoughts', 'are', 'few', 'key', 'changes', 'Clyde', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'ensure', 'plan', 'played', 'out', 'intended', 'end']",N/A

The movie opens with a Nice Father enjoying his wife and child. There is a knock at the door, and The Father is knocked down and subdued by Two Bad Men. His wife is raped in front of him and his daughter is killed.2. Jaime Foxx is the lawyer that makes a deal with the men who killed The Father's family. Apparently, there are some Unspecified Technical Reasons that DNA evidence can't be used against the two killers, and one of them gets a slap on the wrist and the other gets a death sentence.3. 10 years later, the person who was to be executed is executed-- but for some reason the execution is very painful. (We later find out that someone has tampered with the execution medicines.)4. The man who got off with a lighter sentence is then set up to flee his house when police are coming to arrest him for some reason. He has a guardian angel that tells him where to go-- but it turns out to be a setup.5. Re-enter The Father, except that now he is The Assassin. So, he drugs the man (paralyzes) and takes him to a warehouse where he saws him into about 24 pieces, and castrates him afterward (making for 25 pieces, total).6. The Assassin deliberately get himself arrested. From prison, he manages to kill quite a few people, including: The judge who gave the lenient sentences to one of the Bad Men, The DA who negotiated the deal. (It is at this point that we find out that he is a Highly Trained Assassin.) Eventually, the city is locked down.7. The ultimate plan was to blow up city hall, but the Assistant DA finds out and moves the bomb back into his cell. The bomb blows up and kills the Highly Trained Assassin.All in all:This was an excellent film. To me, it would be worth seeing at a film (non-matinee price) or even buying off the New Release shelf. There was an excellent plot here, and that plot was enough to keep you interested but not slip into unbelievability. There was also lots of action, but that supplemented the plot (as opposed to films that are full of action in order to try to mask a weak plot). The film raised ""thought questions"" about the Justice System that also make for good discussion later on. There was also some very good, subtle casting. When the main character was The Father, he was believable in that role. But with a change of makeup and clothes, he also worked very well in the role of Highly Trained Assassin.",5,"Excellent all the way around.

Rather than the humane system put in place, different chemicals are injected causing him to suffer as he dies while Rice, witness to the execution, watches.The second killer finds his release from prison not what he expected. Captured by Shelton and taken to a remote hiding place, he is systematically dismembered while alive by Shelton who has left clues to these proceedings for the police to find. Arrested, he is taken to jail and soon to be put on trial. But Shelton has other plans.Requesting an audience with Rice, he sets up his own plea deal. Let him go free and no one will be hurt. But as long as he stays in prison, those he holds responsible for letting a guilty man go free will pay the price and justice, in his mind, will be served. Seeing as how he is behind bars, Rice finds his threat hard to take seriously. Until people involved in the original case begin to be murdered.And here is where the true twist in the film begins. How is Shelton orchestrating the murders from a prison cell where he has no contact with the outside world? Who can his accomplice be in carrying out his vendetta against a legal system that short changed him when it came to justice in the deaths of his wife and daughter?The cat and mouse game between Shelton and Rice makes for fascinating viewing as pieces of the puzzle are dropped in place while the body count rises. People are taken out by numerous means while Rice survives, held in place to be the last victim. And when a meeting with a member of the clandestine sector (think CIA) lets Rice know that Shelton was the go to guy when it came to methods of killing people, Rice races against time to find out the answers before he and his family are killed.Like all good mysteries, the clues are placed for all to see but its how you interpret them and solve them as a viewer that makes this movie a delight. By the end of the film, you realize you were given these clues throughout, given the chance to solve the puzzle on your own. If you got them right.Foxx does his usual great job as the beleaguered DA who wants to find justice for all but has gotten caught up in a system that is imperfect where criminals go free or do less time to result in convictions. Butler does a great job as a man determined to expose the system for what it is and find his own justice along the way.The movie takes a hard look at the justice system as we witness the battle between these two characters. And both are sympathetic in their own way. Foxx because he was forced to accept less in order to hold his record and Butler, who may be killing people, but as a man forced to watch his family killed before his own eyes only to see the killer walk away. A portion of you wants to root for his side but at the same time you realize his version of justice is a tad turned upside down.This movie will hold your attention from start to finish. And the conclusion will surprise even the most jaded moviegoer. If you're looking for a good movie, look no further than LAW ABIDING CITIZEN.",5,LAW OF THE LAND,1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,4085,"['Actors', 'make', 'good', 'movies', 'make', 'bad', 'movies', 'luck', 'good', 'outweigh', 'bad', 'careers', 'continue', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'return', 'form', 'terrible', 'GAMER', 'time', 'ordinary', 'citizen', 'exceptional', 'abilities', 'LAW', 'ABIDING', 'CITIZEN.Butler', 'Clyde', 'Shelton', 'man', 'living', 'suburban', 'Philadelphia', 'wife', 'daughter', 'home', 'broken', 'Attacked', 'wounded', 'forced', 'watch', 'two', 'men', 'kill', 'family', 'leave', 'dead', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'two', 'men', 'brought', 'justice.But', 'justice', 'can', 'be', 'blind', 'Not', 'enough', 'evidence', 'ties', 'two', 'men', 'crime', 'one', 'other', 'plea', 'bargain', 'Assistant', 'DA', 'Nick', 'Rice', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'stellar', 'conviction', 'record', 'one', 'keep', 'intact', 'propelling', 'career', 'forward', 'deal', 'results', 'death', 'penalty', 'one', 'short', 'term', 'other', 'much', 'disappointment', 'Shelton', 'who', 'suffer.Ten', 'years', 'pass', 'first', 'killer', 'die', 'lethal', 'injection', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'Rather', 'humane', 'system', 'put', 'place', 'different', 'chemicals', 'are', 'injected', 'causing', 'suffer', 'Rice', 'witness', 'execution', 'watches.The', 'second', 'killer', 'release', 'prison', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'Captured', 'Shelton', 'taken', 'remote', 'hiding', 'place', 'systematically', 'dismembered', 'alive', 'Shelton', 'who', 'left', 'clues', 'proceedings', 'police', 'find', 'Arrested', 'taken', 'jail', 'soon', 'be', 'put', 'trial', 'Shelton', 'other', 'plans.Requesting', 'audience', 'Rice', 'up', 'own', 'plea', 'deal', 'Let', 'go', 'free', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'hurt', 'as', 'long', 'prison', 'responsible', 'letting', 'guilty', 'man', 'go', 'free', 'will', 'pay', 'price', 'justice', 'mind', 'will', 'be', 'served', 'Seeing', 'how', 'bars', 'Rice', 'threat', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'people', 'involved', 'original', 'case', 'begin', 'be', 'murdered.And', 'here', 'where', 'true', 'twist', 'film', 'How', 'Shelton', 'orchestrating', 'murders', 'prison', 'cell', 'where', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'Who', 'can', 'accomplice', 'be', 'carrying', 'out', 'vendetta', 'legal', 'system', 'short', 'changed', 'when', 'came', 'justice', 'deaths', 'wife', 'daughter', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Shelton', 'Rice', 'fascinating', 'viewing', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'are', 'dropped', 'place', 'body', 'count', 'People', 'are', 'taken', 'out', 'numerous', 'means', 'Rice', 'survives', 'held', 'place', 'be', 'last', 'victim', 'when', 'meeting', 'member', 'clandestine', 'sector', 'think', 'CIA', 'Rice', 'know', 'Shelton', 'was', 'go', 'guy', 'when', 'came', 'methods', 'killing', 'people', 'Rice', 'time', 'find', 'out', 'answers', 'family', 'are', 'good', 'mysteries', 'clues', 'are', 'placed', 'see', 'how', 'interpret', 'solve', 'viewer', 'movie', 'delight', 'end', 'film', 'realize', 'were', 'given', 'clues', 'given', 'chance', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'own', 'got', 'right.Foxx', 'usual', 'great', 'job', 'beleaguered', 'DA', 'who', 'find', 'justice', 'gotten', 'caught', 'up', 'system', 'imperfect', 'where', 'criminals', 'go', 'free', 'do', 'less', 'time', 'result', 'convictions', 'Butler', 'great', 'job', 'man', 'determined', 'expose', 'system', 'what', 'find', 'own', 'justice', 'way.The', 'movie', 'hard', 'look', 'justice', 'system', 'witness', 'battle', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'own', 'way', 'Foxx', 'was', 'forced', 'accept', 'less', 'order', 'hold', 'record', 'Butler', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'killing', 'people', 'man', 'forced', 'watch', 'family', 'killed', 'own', 'eyes', 'only', 'see', 'killer', 'walk', 'away', 'portion', 'root', 'side', 'same', 'time', 'realize', 'version', 'justice', 'tad', 'turned', 'upside', 'down.This', 'movie', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'start', 'finish', 'conclusion', 'will', 'surprise', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'moviegoer', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'movie', 'look', 'further', 'LAW', 'ABIDING', 'CITIZEN']",N/A

(Forgive me but I thought Butler looked like the brother of Tom Green)Jamie Foxx plays as Nick Rice, the DA who prides himself in his high conviction rate.The murderers were apprehended but the one who did the actual killing makes a deal with Rice to witness against the other guy in order to get a lesser punishment (3 years in jail).Shelton is outraged and plans his revenge.10 years pass, the murderer is out of jail - still as nasty as ever - when he gets a phone call. Turns out to be Shelton who kidnaps him and dismembers him in front of a camera.The police come, arrest Shelton, lock him in jail and thus begins the cat and mouse game.Somehow people involved in the Shelton murder case are getting killed. All evidence points to Clyde...but he's behind bars. Who's his accomplice and how many have to die before Nick is targeted?I found this movie to be overly graphic. I didn't need to see Butler repeatedly jab a steak bone in the neck of a guy. Nor did I need to see what a body looks like without arms, legs or a head.I also hated the language in this film.

The sad fact is that our justice system is not perfect, as evinced by this film - the guy that did the worst gets off with a short jail sentence and the guy who didn't actually kill anyone got a death sentence, but this is what happens when lawyers become more concerned with their records than actually serving justice. This should be a clear message to any lawyers watching the film - DO THE RIGHT THING OR THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN.At first, I was rooting for the Law-Abiding Citizen. The way he dealt with the man who violated and killed his wife and daughters.... bravo! I do wish the torture scene could have been more drawn-out. No, not the torture/cutting itself, but showing him at various stages through his slow death - legless, then armless, etc, begging for his life, the LAC talking to him scolding him, berating him. The movie would have benefited from that, because him doing that to his wife and daughter's murderers was justified.I laughed at the part where the daughter gets the DVD and watches it after her mom tells her not to. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR NOT LISTENING TO YOUR PARENTS, or even checking the address on the envelope. You should know better than to open mail that does not have your name on it, tsk tsk.I felt disappointed when he started going after innocent people, like the lawyer's assistant and the like, because at that point, I was no longer rooting for him. He just totally lost it, and the movie started to feel more unreal/unbelievable, at first I was prepared to give it 5 stars, then it dropped to a three, however, the ending was very good (in a thought-provoking sense), and brought the overall rating back to a 4.

Yeah, I know he can do a Ray Charles impersonation but every time he tries to do something serious, it only leaves me saying ""he can't be serious""! Well, he can't  But with all the over the top violence, things blowing up and bodies piling up, you are easily distracted.As long as you go into this as it being a typical violent vengeance thriller, where every scene is predictable, then it's fine. Get your popcorn and a bucket for when you revisit the popcorn you just ate. Between the buckets of blood and parts, there apparently is a story somewhere.  You don't really care about anyone, but when you are rooting for the bad guy, that pretty much says enjoy the ride.  I'm assuming there was supposed to be a surprise twist, but everything was do predictable, it was more like waiting for it to happen. We see the revenge begin based on the death of certain people in someone's life. That someone goes into great detail of finding the slightest connection to the deaths to anyone.  If you are a lawyer, politician, anyone connected to the case, you are pretty much history.  I was waiting for his dry cleaner to be killed because the starch in the collar of the killer made him angry, or something stupid like that.  So, again, it's about the ride and shock value.  Not script value.I am probably being generous with 4 stars, but I was entertained and it was a thrilling movie.  Would have been a lot more please with someone other than Foxx, like, maybe an actor to play against Butler.

The state's most crucial role was confining the victim and the villains within the justice system. Quickly, the victim realized that such system was also confined by the bounds of laws and restrained by the rigors of gathering evidence. As such, the so many players tasked with gathering evidence created many loopholes for villains to evade conviction and for defendants to raise doubts on the reliability of evidence.Devastated with the ultimate punishment of losing his beloved family, the victim has to endure the hypocrisy of striking deals with criminals. Impatient with the bureaucratic behemoth of the legal system, the victim entrusted his mastery of physical sciences over the mastery of changing the so many minds of the bureaucratic machine. Losing objectivity, the victim embarked on a campaign of vengeance against any encounter that would display the slightest hint of unaccountability.Dismembering the real and direct villains did not end the victim's ordeal for getting justice. He must deal with the consequences of his vigilante's deeds. The same prosecutor who struck deals with criminals in order to obtain conviction, must extract confession from the victim- vigilante in order to conclude the ongoing action. While still alive and resourceful, the victim had few ammunition to straighten out the unscrupulous justice officials for the slightest altercations. As the death toll starts rising, the cleverness of the resourceful vigilante gave up to the vast power of the state.At the end, the movie succeeded in portraying the endless suffering of the prosecutor in having to address the skepticism of his own colleagues in the morality of his deal-striking approach, the mistrust of the traumatized victims who expects nothing less that plain and expedient justice, and the objective judge who must balance the evidence according to rigorous legal standards.",5,Brilliant display of the psychodynamics of all involved in criminal justice.,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,2143,"['few', 'intense', 'minutes', 'movie', 'transformation', 'harmonious', 'family', 'abyss', 'criminal', 'insanity.The', 'sole', 'survivor', 'such', 'gruesome', 'upheaval', 'was', 'left', 'nothing', 'lose', 'live', 'other', 'struggling', 'finding', 'illusive', 'enemies', 'state', 'most', 'crucial', 'role', 'was', 'confining', 'victim', 'villains', 'justice', 'system', 'Quickly', 'victim', 'realized', 'such', 'system', 'was', 'also', 'confined', 'bounds', 'laws', 'restrained', 'rigors', 'gathering', 'evidence', 'such', 'so', 'many', 'players', 'tasked', 'gathering', 'evidence', 'created', 'many', 'loopholes', 'villains', 'evade', 'conviction', 'defendants', 'raise', 'doubts', 'reliability', 'evidence.Devastated', 'ultimate', 'punishment', 'losing', 'beloved', 'family', 'victim', 'endure', 'hypocrisy', 'striking', 'deals', 'criminals', 'Impatient', 'bureaucratic', 'behemoth', 'legal', 'system', 'victim', 'entrusted', 'mastery', 'physical', 'sciences', 'mastery', 'changing', 'so', 'many', 'minds', 'bureaucratic', 'machine', 'Losing', 'objectivity', 'victim', 'embarked', 'campaign', 'vengeance', 'encounter', 'would', 'display', 'slightest', 'hint', 'unaccountability.Dismembering', 'real', 'direct', 'villains', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'victim', 'ordeal', 'getting', 'justice', 'must', 'deal', 'consequences', 'vigilante', 'deeds', 'same', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'struck', 'deals', 'criminals', 'order', 'obtain', 'conviction', 'must', 'extract', 'confession', 'victim-', 'vigilante', 'order', 'conclude', 'ongoing', 'action', 'still', 'alive', 'resourceful', 'victim', 'had', 'few', 'ammunition', 'straighten', 'out', 'unscrupulous', 'justice', 'officials', 'slightest', 'altercations', 'death', 'toll', 'rising', 'cleverness', 'resourceful', 'vigilante', 'gave', 'up', 'vast', 'power', 'state.At', 'end', 'movie', 'succeeded', 'portraying', 'endless', 'suffering', 'prosecutor', 'having', 'address', 'skepticism', 'own', 'colleagues', 'morality', 'deal-striking', 'approach', 'mistrust', 'traumatized', 'victims', 'who', 'nothing', 'plain', 'expedient', 'justice', 'objective', 'judge', 'who', 'must', 'balance', 'evidence', 'according', 'rigorous', 'legal', 'standards']",N/A

I'll be the first to admit that this is not a great movie by any means, but for pure entertainment value, this one gets my vote.The acting by Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx is above average, even pretty good at times. I feared that both would be just showing up for a paycheck here. Gerard Butler seemed to be having fun and I really enjoyed his character. I also liked how the perception of the two lead characters changed as the movie progressed. You start off favoring Gerard over Jamie, but then it switches and the good guy is now the villain.On the negative side of things. There are a couple of scenes that aren't believable and it reminded me of the SAW series on more than one occasion. The ending felt really rushed, but some things did catch me by surprise. I do wish they would have done a little more of those mini creative traps, like the spiked gun handle full of poison or the controlled cell phone explosion. While this film is very violent, most of it is implied. Don't get me wrong, there is a good amount of gore, but not nearly as much as I expected.Worth a rental or a buy at this cheap price.

A man, Clyde Shelton, feels that he was denied justice over the death of his wife and daughter and wants to punish those that were responsible.  But what happens is the ADA, Nick Rice, who prosecuted the case with an eye more on his win lose ratio, becomes the hero and victim of the his ambition becomes the villian.  About 10 minutes is used to set up the story but there is no transition to show or justify anything.  All of a sudden the ADA is caring and the victim becomes a psychopath.Beyond that there are key plot points that are simply wrong.It is stated that Clyde bought a number of properties in the area under his own name but transferred title to a dummy Panamanian company.  Therefore, they cannot locate them because of protections by the Panamanian government.  The first part of this is wrong.  If he bought them under his name, they can find the properties as the names of all previous owners remain attached to the properties forever.  This is a simple computer search.  Additionally, if you have the name of the Panamainian shell company, it would be listed on numerous public records including property tax records!Second, Nick gets a list of amounts paid by the dummy corp and then compare them to the sale prices of commercial properties.  By doing this he locates a property next to the prison that Clyde is being held.  This would be impossible.  It is obvious that the writer never purchased a piece of property!  The check you write at closing is not the purchase price of the property but a net amount, purchase price less deposit plus closing costs, etc.  It is never the exact purchase price.Finally, Clyde is suppose to be a genius.  Therefore, if he planted a bomb, he would have put tamper guards which would have made it impossible for them to move the bomb even a few inches let alone many miles accross town.These a the worst plot points.  There are just too many to list.Add to this a mediocre performance by Jamie Foxx and a confused performance by Gerrard Butler and you have movie that is a waste of time.",2,Good premise bad execution,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,2150,"['What', 'hate', 'more', 'bad', 'movie', 'one', 'had', 'great', 'premise', 'it.This', 'simple', 'plot', 'man', 'Clyde', 'Shelton', 'was', 'denied', 'justice', 'death', 'wife', 'daughter', 'punish', 'were', 'responsible', 'what', 'ADA', 'Nick', 'Rice', 'who', 'prosecuted', 'case', 'eye', 'more', 'win', 'lose', 'ratio', 'hero', 'victim', 'ambition', 'villian', '10', 'minutes', 'used', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'transition', 'show', 'justify', 'anything', 'sudden', 'ADA', 'caring', 'victim', 'psychopath.Beyond', 'are', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'simply', 'wrong.It', 'stated', 'Clyde', 'bought', 'number', 'properties', 'area', 'own', 'name', 'transferred', 'title', 'dummy', 'Panamanian', 'company', 'Therefore', 'can', 'not', 'locate', 'protections', 'Panamanian', 'government', 'first', 'part', 'wrong', 'bought', 'name', 'can', 'find', 'properties', 'names', 'previous', 'owners', 'remain', 'attached', 'properties', 'forever', 'simple', 'computer', 'search', 'Additionally', 'have', 'name', 'Panamainian', 'shell', 'company', 'would', 'be', 'listed', 'numerous', 'public', 'records', 'including', 'property', 'tax', 'records', 'Second', 'Nick', 'list', 'amounts', 'paid', 'dummy', 'corp', 'then', 'compare', 'sale', 'prices', 'commercial', 'properties', 'doing', 'property', 'next', 'prison', 'Clyde', 'being', 'held', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'obvious', 'writer', 'never', 'purchased', 'piece', 'property', 'check', 'write', 'closing', 'not', 'purchase', 'price', 'property', 'net', 'amount', 'purchase', 'price', 'less', 'deposit', 'closing', 'costs', 'etc', 'never', 'exact', 'purchase', 'price.Finally', 'Clyde', 'suppose', 'be', 'genius', 'Therefore', 'planted', 'bomb', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'tamper', 'guards', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'impossible', 'move', 'bomb', 'even', 'few', 'inches', 'let', 'alone', 'many', 'miles', 'town.These', 'worst', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'list.Add', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'confused', 'performance', 'Gerrard', 'Butler', 'have', 'movie', 'waste', 'time']",N/A

Unlike other movies, I felt very indifferent  about it. I didn't have any desire to see it again but I didn't hate it. It just kind of happened.Part of the problem is the characters in the film. You are meant to feel sympathy for the Gerard Butler character yet there's no real explanation as to how he became the monster that he is in the movie. His family gets killed but his actions resemble that of a sociopath who felt no remorse at all for his actions. Jamie Foxx's character is also flawed. He's not particularly likable and you don't get behind him like you would for another other protagonist. It was hard to believe I was watching an Oscar winning actor at times. The rest of the supporting cast are bland and I didn't feel much for them when they met their demise.The plot is generic but well paced. I'm glad it didn't go two hours for I would definitely have lost interest if it had run much longer. The resolution is ok, but doesn't make too much sense. The movie is one big shot at the legal system but the resolution is not plausible in today's world.I would not recommend purchasing this movie.

KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[3, 5]","I really enjoyed this entertaining, if contrived tale of revenge, but I think the ending truly spoils this slick exploitation film. The films starts off with a bang and has us wanting this unlikely anti-hero to succeed in his destructive mission. The acting is good, but I didn't feel the script allowed us to really get into these character's heads as much as I would have liked.*****SPOILER ALERT*****The film has a rather silly and contrived ending that feels like a cop out or maybe it's just a case of laziness. Here is the ending I would have liked.When Foxx's character finds the bomb at City Hall, he goes back to Butler's cell to find that he is gone. The bomb they found is a decoy and there is a note in Butler's cell for Foxx stating ""He Blew It!"". Then immediately after reading this note, City Hall is blown sky high with all the officials going with it. The next scene could go two ways, either by having Butler's character escape and letting the justice system know he will be watching..... or having Foxx visiting Butler in an insane asylum with Butler waking from his morbid dream of revenge as he couldn't cope with the loss of his family. He had been there for the past ten years ever since the system let his family's murderers off! Foxx feels guilty and has been spending those ten years and the rest of his legal career righting the wrong he had done to Butler's character. Either ending is surely better than the silly ending used in the film.*****End Of Spoiler*****I'm no screen writer, but why not give the people what they want in a film like this. The anti-hero is set up to be the character we sympathize with and they should have let us have the total package. It's about time we had a non-traditional happy ending in one of these types of films!

This was such the case with Law Abiding Citizen.Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is an upstanding family man whose wife and daughter are brutally murdered during a home invasion. When the killers are caught, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a hotshot young Philadelphia prosecutor, is assigned to the case. Over his objections, Nick is forced by his boss to offer one of the suspects a light sentence in exchange for testifying against his accomplice.Fast forward ten years...The man who got away with murder is found dead, and Clyde Shelton coolly admits his guilt. Then he issues a warning to Nick -- either fix the flawed justice system that failed his family, or key players in the trial will die.While Law Abiding Citizen will never go down as a ""must see film"" in the pages of history, it does have it's moments.The plot, written by Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium, Ultraviolet), is pretty as he portrays his usual fan fair of a corrupt fallible movement; however, under the skillful direction of F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job), and the acting skills of Gerald Butler and Jamie Fox, Law Abiding is actually a half-way decent film.While at first glance, all of the violence in the film seems unnecessary, it does help get across the message that Wimmer and F. Gary Gray are trying to get across to the audience -- that the judicial system in this country is not always what it is cracked up to be.The DVD video and audio quality of Overture Film's Law Abiding Citizen is pretty much standard. Grain and noise is hardly visible, while the soundtrack is crisp and clear. The extras included on the DVD contain an audio commentary, Featuring Producers Lucas Foster and Alan Siegel, and a few small featurettes on the film, and it's theatrical trailer.If your looking for a good revenge film with a bit of a message, then Law Abiding System is a good film to see.

Doyle ""film buff""","[1, 2]","Although there are plenty of opportunities to find loopholes in the script for LAW ABIDING CITIZEN, it's basically a thriller about vengeance sought by a man wronged by the justice system who feels he has a right to kill anyone connected with the case involving the brutal murder of his wife and daughter.And it's directed in such a skillful way by F. Gary Gray and played with such intensity by GERARD BUTLER and JAMIE FOXX, that it keeps you riveted to the screen for the duration of the plot. The supporting performances are all expert, especially VIOLA DAVIS as the frustrated mayor of Philadelphia and ANNIE CORLEY as a judge who rules by the book. Foxx is the DA who orchestrates a plea bargain for the sake of winning 96% of his cases. Thus begins Butler's ten-year plan for revenge.When you stop to think about it, much of the plot is less than credible with Butler able to outwit and keep one step ahead of the authorities all the way until the contrived ending. But it's an interesting plot, keeping the viewer in suspense as to what will happen next. It succeeds on the high tension level right up to the fiery climax.Butler scowls a lot and gives the impression that he can hold a grudge better than any man on earth, especially since what he does goes to such extremes.Although none of the characters have much depth, they move through their roles with enough skill to make even the credibility angle be something you're likely to overlook for the sake of a good thriller.

Directed by F. Gary Gray, the film stars Gerard Butler as Clyde Shelton, a father whose wife and daughter are killed while he is tied up.  When lawyer Nick Russo (Jamie Foxx) works out a plea bargain with the 'real' killer who testifies against his accomplice, Shelton feels like the legal system wronged his family.Ten years later, Shelton returns to seek revenge against the man he blamed for his family's death.  Law Abiding Citizen is not your typical man seeks revenge thriller.  Shelton has much greater plans than taking out one man.  Instead, he intends to punish everyone involved in what he believes is a corrupt and bureaucratic legal system.When Nick and his cohorts discover that Clyde is more than just a wronged man, and that his background is designing and developing killing machines, they realize they are in trouble.  Clyde begins to systematically kill everyone he blames for the death of his wife and daughter.  Unwilling to break the law and kill Clyde in cold blood, Nick struggles to figure out how Clyde is killing from prison and how to outsmart his intelligent nemesis.Law Abiding Citizen is a brilliant and intelligent action film with a clever and original concept.  The audience is perplexed by a difficulty in deciding which side of the story to be on.  Initially, your natural reaction is to root for the emotional revenge of a man who lost his wife and daughter.  However, as the story carries on, Clyde takes on more of a villainous role and Foxx's character comes forward as the film's protagonist.If you want an action-packed, smart, and entertaining suspense movie of a new mold, Law Abiding Citizen is a must-see Blu-ray release for you.

What happens in this film is so far fetched that there is no way it could ever happen in reality, in the real world. What the character Gerard Butler plays accomplishes is so impossible that the slickest and most professional government agents on the planet could never pull it off. No one has the capability to excercise the kind of power and control that Butlers character seems to have in this film. To add insult to injury some of the acting in this was rather pathetic. Butler was really weak in this role, as were numerous other actors. This entire film had me thinking constantly things like Good lord, give me a break or Gawd how silly. There however is plenty of action, and if you can find it within your self to suspend any sense of reality you might actually enjoy the dumb premise to the film. I did in some odd way even though I kept thinking how stupid the whole affair really was.

It then serves its purpose as light popcorn fare since it is merely meant as entertainment, not a social thesis. And on that level, it fairly succeeds and it is a waste to exhaust any mental workouts breaking down the many, MANY bad filmmaking flaws. THE END.But, if this doesnt help the reader any on how to approach this product, then read on ....Why does it get a giant Megan Fox thumb's up and yet its accompanied by a only three rating? This is what is referred to as a guilty pleasure. If made well, the plot, as implausible as it may be, will keep the audience intrigued, even if just to cross the I's and T's for the viewer before they walk away. For any potential snub reader, riddle me this: what draws and continues to bring audiences back to movies such as Avatar, Star Wars, Austin Powers, Pretty Woman (a HOOKER who lands a billionaire!), It's a Wonderful Life (about a prick who gets to redeem himself only after seeing his family HAPPY without him?), Field of Dreams (a second chance of warming to your parents after shunning their existence the first time around!), etc....? It's called SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Now, the second element necessary to enjoy a guilty pleasure is the casting.In order for the audience to enjoy and want to revisit pricks, hookers, idiot spies, intergalactic peacekeepers, et al. the actors must have the ability to sell the characters they are portraying, since usually the script will be inane and the writing can have you wincing. For some outrageous act of faith, Tinseltown has transformed Foxx into a bonafide star. Though not and never will be familiar with Redemption (his first Porsche), Collateral and Jarhead offered fine performances because Michael Mann and Sam Mendez are expert craftsmen who knew how to arrest his comedian/broham tendencies. If not for Butler, this movie would have been a complete disaster. And Butler will never be confused for a thespian in the Olivier, Welles, Day-Lewis, Hopkins mold either. (And yes, i am quite aware he was a stage actor in the UK).Does anyone remember Stealth, The Kingdom, Miami Vice, Ray (which he portrayed on numerous occasions in his comedy skits!), The Soloist (even Downey, Jr. looked embarrassed)? This dude is not a professional actor, though does have a massive ego. (watch The Great White Hype, to enjoy Foxx on film).I understand Hollywood will continue to search through coal mines (jewel metaphor reference), bar clubs (Vin Diesel), gimmick forums (wrestlers), etc.... for the next cash cow and if you were in charge of studio projects, you would as well. Blockbusters and guilty pleasures is what makes it possible to produce Oscar quality films, it's a fact. But, it doesnt mean as an audience, we have to always swallow what they attempt to feed us.

Heck, a great thing about a lot of movies is being ABLE to do that and just have a childlike good time.  There are many mentally undemanding movies that delight:  THE HANGOVER is the most recent example that springs immediately to my mind.  It stretches credibility, yet is generally so well cast and constructed, and so genial in its carrying on that only a real Scrooge wouldn't crack a smile.  I would also say that CRANK 2, a truly jaw-droppingly unrealistic movie actually works in its quite twisted way because it clearly knows that it has gone way to far in terms of physical believability or even good taste.  (SHOOT `EM UP is an even better example.)  These kinds of films are sometimes guilty pleasures...but they often are the movies that come down from the video shelf over and over again.  I've watched SUPERBAD a few more times than CITIZEN KANE.  Is it a better movie?  Hardly!  Is it more entertaining?  Yep!  And it has heart, too.Then there is LAW ABIDING CITIZEN, a movie that wants to be serious, intelligent, ""adult"" action thriller with a moral message.  In reality, it is a piece of trash that needed to embrace its real self.  Thus, it mostly fails as either kind of movie.The film opens with us meeting handsome but homespun Gerard Butler as he shares tender moments with his young daughter and lovely wife.  He is an inventor or engineer of some sort, but mostly seems to be a nice guy that you'd expect is nice to his neighbors, goes to church, wears sweaters and is devoted to his family.  A GOOD guy.  Yet in mere moments, he suffers a home invasion that leaves him without a family.  His family is killed  before his eyes in a manner that is so uncomfortable to watch that we frankly never quite shake the squalor.  I realize there's nothing ""entertaining"" about a family being killed, but direct F. Gary Gray goes a bit too far.  He doesn't just generate righteous outrage in  us, but an uncomfortable feeling of ""this movie  has gone too far for a piece of fluff.""The bad guys are caught, and prosecutor Jamie Foxx steps in.  A driven man with an eye on  his next promotion (has there ever been a movie ADA that isn't ambitious and driven to replace his boss?), Foxx eventually plea bargains with the bad guys, much to the unbelieving anger of Butler (understandably).Years pass, and one of the bad guys gets out of jail.  He is almost immediately kidnapped, tortured and killed by Butler (again, in a manner that borders on films more like SAW and HOSTEL).  And Butler is almost immediately caught an imprisoned.  But now he's not such a teddy bear.  He's a ruthless killer of his own, who apparently has figured out a way to carry out a rather complex revenge scheme, even while in prison.  Foxx must figure out what's going on before Butler has killed his entire team, because he blames the system as much as he blames the killers.The film contains lots of scenes of verbal cat-and-mouse between Butler and Foxx, and the two do bring a lot of charisma to their scenes together.  But the script isn't particularly intelligent (although the way the film is directed...and  filmed, with lots of gray tones), clearly the creators thought it was smart and taut.But the killings become more and more elaborate and rococo.  Butler resembles little more than a more handsome and healthy SAW killer...able to spin elaborate murders that are also neat little moral lessons.We're clearly meant to agonize over what Butler is doing.  The system certainly wronged him...coupling that wrong with what he endured, along with a brilliant engineer's mind, and you apparently have the recipe for a diabolical (but righteous) serial killer.  Foxx mostly glowers and looks angry, and other than a few bursts in his encounters with Butler, his performance is one-note and not very interesting.  NOTHING of  his natural charm comes through...he's created a workaholic tighta** who is also a humorless party-pooper.  So it's actually easier to root for Butler than for him (although Butler's performance is one-note as well...he at least has some manic, if unspecific, energy).But while 85% of the movie is a fairly uninspired thriller with a few explosions and some gruesome killings...we ARE left to wonder:  how is Butler doing all this from jail?  Does he have help from the outside?  And then, wonder of wonders, the truth is revealed and the movie goes from being just barely okay to jaw-droppingly laughable.  It's a ""surprise"" twist that should win awards of audacity (and also for implausibility).  I had to laugh outloud, then I stopped to assure myself the movie was REALLY doing  what I thought it was, and when I ascertained that it indeed WAS...I laughed some more.How anyone made the final few scenes with a straight face is beyond me.  Had the movie been made with a tone that was more ""nudge-nudge"" than deadly serious, it might have come across as just another crazy twist in a wacky revenge fantasia.  Instead, it was the final nail in the coffin of self-seriousness that this film should be buried in.I can find very little to reason for you to endure this film.  I've done it for you, and you should thank me for the warning!!",1,1.5 stars.

1298026,A3875KWK1PXG7I,B002XMGGJM,Robert Huggins,"[0, 1]","""Law Abiding Citizen"" isn't great film making, but it does accomplish what it sets out to do . . . . entertain its audience.  The plot of a man in jail who plans the murders of those involved in the murder of his wife and daughter seems a bit farfetched until one considers that real life mob bosses have ordered executions from behind bars.  The film is helped by some snappy pacing and good performances from the two leads Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler (who was also one of the film's producers).  With plenty of violence and bad language, the film justly deserves its ""R"" rating and is not recommended for younger viewers and those who have a low tolerance of such things.A film of recent vintage (2009), ""Law Abiding Citizen"" looks and sounds great on DVD and has plenty of extras including:- Audio Commentary from two of the co-producers (Lucas Foster and Alan Siegel)- Featurette:  The Justice of ""Law Abiding Citizen""- Featurette:  Law in Black and White - Behind the Scenes- Featurette:  Preliminary Arguments - The Visual Effects of ""Law Abiding Citizen""- Featurette:  The Verdict - Winning Trailer Mash-Up and, of course . . . .- Theatrical Trailer for ""Law Abiding Citizen""Those who enjoy modern day thrillers will likely enjoy ""Law Abiding Citizen,"" which I recommend with some reservations.",3,Solid Thriller,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,1302,"['Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'making', 'accomplish', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'entertain', 'audience', 'plot', 'man', 'jail', 'who', 'murders', 'involved', 'murder', 'wife', 'daughter', 'bit', 'farfetched', 'one', 'considers', 'real', 'life', 'mob', 'bosses', 'have', 'ordered', 'executions', 'bars', 'film', 'helped', 'snappy', 'pacing', 'good', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'film', 'producers', 'plenty', 'violence', 'bad', 'language', 'film', 'justly', 'R', 'rating', 'not', 'recommended', 'younger', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'low', 'tolerance', 'such', 'things.A', 'film', 'recent', 'vintage', '2009', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'great', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'extras', 'including', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'two', 'co-producers', 'Lucas', 'Foster', 'Alan', 'Siegel', 'Featurette', 'Justice', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'Featurette', 'Law', 'Black', 'White', 'Scenes-', 'Featurette', 'Preliminary', 'Arguments', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'Featurette', 'Verdict', 'Winning', 'Trailer', 'Mash-Up', 'course', '.-', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'who', 'enjoy', 'modern', 'day', 'thrillers', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'recommend', 'reservations']",N/A

1298030,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002XMGGJM,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","***1/2""Law Abiding Citizen"" starts out like a modern-day version of ""Death Wish,"" spends a few moments aping the ""Saw"" franchise, then settles in as a cat-and-mouse crime drama centered around the theme that the American legal system seems designed as much to thwart justice as to enact it.The movie stands firmly in the long tradition of wish-fulfillment fantasies in which the victim of a broken legal system - functioning as a stand-in for an equally frustrated and helpless audience - finally says enough is enough and takes matters into his own hands, even going outside the limits of the law, if that's what it takes, to achieve justice.As with the Charles Bronson character in ""Death Wish,"" Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton witnesses his wife and daughter being brutally raped and murdered by a couple of armed intruders. When the worst of the perpetrators cops a plea and is back out on the streets after a mere three years behind bars, Clyde is forced to take matters into his own hands. But he isn't content merely to bring down the killers themselves but to systematically go after everyone in the legal system - from strict-constructionist judges to hamstrung attorneys - who helped facilitate the injustice. That's where Nick Rice, well played by Jamie Foxx, comes in, the decent but by-the-book prosecutor who helped set up the deal and has now, along with everyone else involved with the case, become a prime target for Clyde's take-no-prisoners reign of terror and retribution.The one thing that distinguishes ""Law Abiding Citizen"" from similar films in the genre is that it's not afraid to have a deeply troubled, possibly even psychotic, character at its core. For Clyde does not fit the mold of the typically lovable antihero. The audience is, in the early stages at least, asked to root him on as a conventional Angel of Retribution dispensing the justice that the court system saw fit to deny him, but so much of what he winds up doing steps so far over the line that we eventually balk at his tactics. It's this moral ambiguity that helps to mitigate some of the implausibility of Kurt Wimmer's screenplay, which often goes for effect at the expense of credibility. Indeed the movie's insistence at making him a sort of omnipotent, omnipresent existential force of nature to be reckoned with takes the movie out of the realm of reality and cheapens some of what it is trying to do. And, in the process of reaching its climax, the movie takes a plot turn so ludicrous and credibility-defying that the whole thing pretty much crashes and burns at the end.That being said, Nick's interactions with Clyde are fun to watch and, thanks to taut direction by F. Gary Gray, there are some moments of genuine suspense scattered along the way. So if you can put your skepticism and critical-thinking skills on hold for the duration, you can have a pretty decent time with ""Law Abiding Citizen.""",3,Entertaining if occasionally implausible crime thriller,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,2902,"['***1/2', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'out', 'modern-day', 'version', 'Death', 'Wish', 'few', 'moments', 'aping', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'then', 'cat-and-mouse', 'crime', 'drama', 'centered', 'theme', 'American', 'legal', 'system', 'designed', 'much', 'thwart', 'justice', 'enact', 'it.The', 'movie', 'firmly', 'long', 'tradition', 'wish-fulfillment', 'fantasies', 'victim', 'broken', 'legal', 'system', 'functioning', 'stand-in', 'equally', 'frustrated', 'helpless', 'audience', 'finally', 'enough', 'enough', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'even', 'going', 'limits', 'law', 'what', 'achieve', 'justice.As', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'character', 'Death', 'Wish', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Clyde', 'Shelton', 'wife', 'daughter', 'being', 'brutally', 'raped', 'murdered', 'couple', 'armed', 'intruders', 'When', 'worst', 'perpetrators', 'cops', 'plea', 'back', 'out', 'streets', 'mere', 'three', 'years', 'bars', 'Clyde', 'forced', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', ""n't"", 'content', 'merely', 'bring', 'down', 'killers', 'systematically', 'go', 'everyone', 'legal', 'system', 'strict-constructionist', 'judges', 'hamstrung', 'attorneys', 'who', 'helped', 'facilitate', 'injustice', 'where', 'Nick', 'Rice', 'well', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'decent', 'by-the-book', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'helped', 'set', 'up', 'deal', 'now', 'everyone', 'else', 'involved', 'case', 'become', 'prime', 'target', 'Clyde', 'take-no-prisoners', 'reign', 'terror', 'retribution.The', 'one', 'thing', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'similar', 'films', 'genre', 'not', 'afraid', 'have', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'possibly', 'even', 'psychotic', 'character', 'core', 'Clyde', 'not', 'fit', 'mold', 'typically', 'lovable', 'antihero', 'audience', 'early', 'stages', 'least', 'asked', 'root', 'conventional', 'Angel', 'Retribution', 'dispensing', 'justice', 'court', 'system', 'saw', 'fit', 'deny', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'up', 'doing', 'steps', 'so', 'far', 'line', 'eventually', 'balk', 'tactics', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'mitigate', 'implausibility', 'Kurt', 'Wimmer', 'screenplay', 'often', 'effect', 'expense', 'credibility', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'insistence', 'making', 'sort', 'omnipotent', 'omnipresent', 'existential', 'force', 'nature', 'be', 'reckoned', 'movie', 'realm', 'reality', 'what', 'trying', 'do', 'process', 'reaching', 'climax', 'movie', 'plot', 'turn', 'so', 'ludicrous', 'credibility-defying', 'whole', 'thing', 'pretty', 'much', 'crashes', 'burns', 'end.That', 'being', 'said', 'Nick', 'interactions', 'Clyde', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'thanks', 'taut', 'direction', 'F.', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'are', 'moments', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'scattered', 'way', 'So', 'can', 'put', 'skepticism', 'critical-thinking', 'skills', 'hold', 'duration', 'can', 'have', 'pretty', 'decent', 'time', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen']",N/A

Its what it seems to suggest to me. This movie (unintentionally) might be the most nihilistic movie in recent American cinema history.  Really, what this movie was about was not the illogic of ""the system"" or even vigilante justice, rather subtextually was about the madness of humankind, unfortunately the movie's makers didnt see it that way. Im not sure if the problem with the movie rest with the script or the directing but somewhere along the way it got compromised, what should have been a dark psychological thriller about individual necessity and the pleasure principle, instead became an action thriller, with an attempt at social commentary and cardboard cutout characters whose motivations are well defined early but inner conflicts are ignored.  By the end of the movie the only thing that could have made this movie at least ""3 stars"" (and saved it from mediocrity) was the denouement, unfortunately it failed there because it was made to please the masses; end it with a smile, end it with a life affirming shot, when it was anything but life affirming.The ending is pretty insulting to at least my intelligence. As if somehow the conclusion is ""all good"". Perfect example is ""Apocalypse Now"", the ending there confirms the madness, the horror in the world, it just doesn't brush it aside like this movie did; leaving me with a bitter taste in my mouth from the convention end that discredited all the work of the entire movie up till then, a plot that was attempting not be clich&eacute;d. But in the end, turned out to be far more clich&eacute;d and vanilla than one of those old Lone Ranger episodes.One last thought: had I known that this movie was written by the same person who wrote ""The Recruit"",Kurt Wimmer, I would have avoided it, because that movie is in my do not ever mention again, garbage pile.",1,Why try to make a serious movie if your not serious?,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,1929,"['chatter', 'online', 'premise', 'movie', 'what', 'really', 'Kill', 'be', 'killed', 'what', 'suggest', 'movie', 'unintentionally', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'nihilistic', 'movie', 'recent', 'American', 'cinema', 'history', 'Really', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'was', 'not', 'illogic', 'system', 'even', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'rather', 'subtextually', 'was', 'madness', 'humankind', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'makers', 'didnt', 'see', 'way', 'Im', 'not', 'sure', 'problem', 'movie', 'rest', 'script', 'directing', 'somewhere', 'way', 'got', 'compromised', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'dark', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'individual', 'necessity', 'pleasure', 'principle', 'instead', 'became', 'action', 'thriller', 'attempt', 'social', 'commentary', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'characters', 'motivations', 'are', 'well', 'defined', 'early', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'are', 'ignored', 'end', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'least', '3', 'stars', 'saved', 'mediocrity', 'was', 'denouement', 'unfortunately', 'failed', 'there', 'was', 'made', 'please', 'masses', 'end', 'smile', 'end', 'life', 'affirming', 'shot', 'when', 'was', 'anything', 'life', 'affirming.The', 'ending', 'pretty', 'insulting', 'least', 'intelligence', 'conclusion', 'good', 'Perfect', 'example', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'ending', 'there', 'madness', 'horror', 'world', 'just', ""n't"", 'brush', 'aside', 'movie', 'did', 'leaving', 'bitter', 'taste', 'mouth', 'convention', 'end', 'discredited', 'work', 'entire', 'movie', 'up', 'till', 'then', 'plot', 'was', 'attempting', 'not', 'be', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd.', 'end', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'vanilla', 'one', 'old', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'episodes.One', 'last', 'thought', 'had', 'known', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'wrote', 'Recruit', 'Kurt', 'Wimmer', 'would', 'have', 'avoided', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'ever', 'mention', 'again', 'garbage', 'pile']",N/A

When the killers are caught, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a hotshot young Philadelphia prosecutor is assigned to the case. Against his will, Nick is forced to offer one of the suspects a light sentence in exchange for testifying against his accomplice. Fast forward ten years...""This is the setup for Law Abiding Citizen, which at first appears to be another a legal thriller but little by little becomes a revenge film in a similar fashion toThe Punisherand the like. Clyde is out for vengeance and it is Nick's job to prove in court that Clyde is guilty, a phrase from the movie ""it is not what you know, but what you can prove in court"" echoes the conflict between these two characters throughout the film.The movie was quite entertaining and this is basically due to the fact that there are several reveals and twists that help the story move forward, Clyde's quest for vengeance is quite gory at times so parents be warned if watching this with young kids. Acting is quite good but definitely not the best from Jamie Foxx. Gerard Butler's character is written in a way that even though you know he's wrong and he is clearly the bad guy you still feel empathy for his cause, which makes him a very interesting character. Simply put, `Law Abiding Citizen' is what I would call a  popcorn flick, do not expect a work of art but pure entertaining, if you see it like this you will definitely enjoy it and accept its bizarre and bloody death sequences.The edition included in this DVD is the 109 minute theatrical version, theLaw Abiding Citizen [Blu-ray]edition does include both the theatrical and uncut versions if you are interested in it and own a Bluray player. The movie is presented in an anamorphic wide screen frame of 2.40:1. The video quality is average considering this is a DVD, after watching it though I don't think this is a movie that would benefit too much in the Bluray format as it is mostly interiors and prison scenes. The same goes for the sound, a track in Dolby Surround 5.1 sound is included but there aren't really too many sequences that would take advantage of it. Subtitles included are English for the deaf and hearing impaired and Spanish.Several extras are included in this editions and are listed as follows:* An extra audio track with the audio commentary by Producers Lucas Foster and Alan Siegel (the little I could actually check was interesting, they acknowledge some plot holes they had to fill, production notes and the like so if you liked the film I would recommend you listen to it)* The Justice of 'Law Abiding Citizen'  featuring cast and crew and an actual LA prosecutor talking about the legal ramifications of the case the film's about.* Law in Black and White - Behind the Scenes  is a black and white piece behind the scenes.* Preliminary Arguments - The Visual Effects of 'Law Abiding Citizen' highlights some sequences of the film (which I will not describe to avoid spoilers for people who has not watched it) and the FX in them.Also included is The Verdict - Winning Trailer Mash-Up, the theatrical trailer and additional trailers forThe Men Who Stare At Goats,Capitalism: A Love Story, and Spartacus: Blood and Sand",4,Not a legal thriller but a vengeance movie!,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,3319,"['DVD', 'slipcover', 'Clyde', 'Shelton', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'upstanding', 'family', 'man', 'wife', 'daughter', 'were', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'home', 'invasion', 'When', 'killers', 'are', 'caught', 'Nick', 'Rice', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'hotshot', 'young', 'Philadelphia', 'prosecutor', 'assigned', 'case', 'Against', 'will', 'Nick', 'forced', 'offer', 'one', 'suspects', 'light', 'sentence', 'exchange', 'testifying', 'accomplice', 'Fast', 'forward', 'ten', 'years', 'setup', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'first', 'be', 'legal', 'thriller', 'little', 'little', 'becomes', 'revenge', 'film', 'similar', 'fashion', 'toThe', 'Punisherand', 'like', 'Clyde', 'out', 'vengeance', 'Nick', 'job', 'prove', 'court', 'Clyde', 'guilty', 'phrase', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'know', 'what', 'can', 'prove', 'court', 'conflict', 'two', 'characters', 'film.The', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'basically', 'due', 'fact', 'are', 'several', 'reveals', 'twists', 'help', 'story', 'move', 'forward', 'Clyde', 'quest', 'vengeance', 'quite', 'gory', 'times', 'so', 'parents', 'be', 'warned', 'watching', 'young', 'kids', 'Acting', 'quite', 'good', 'definitely', 'not', 'best', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'character', 'written', 'way', 'even', 'know', 'wrong', 'clearly', 'bad', 'guy', 'still', 'feel', 'empathy', 'cause', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'Simply', 'put', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'work', 'art', 'pure', 'entertaining', 'see', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'accept', 'bizarre', 'bloody', 'death', 'sequences.The', 'edition', 'included', 'DVD', '109', 'minute', 'theatrical', 'version', 'theLaw', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'edition', 'include', 'theatrical', 'uncut', 'versions', 'are', 'interested', 'own', 'Bluray', 'player', 'movie', 'presented', 'anamorphic', 'wide', 'screen', 'frame', '2.40:1', 'video', 'quality', 'average', 'considering', 'DVD', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'benefit', 'too', 'much', 'Bluray', 'format', 'mostly', 'interiors', 'prison', 'scenes', 'same', 'sound', 'track', 'Dolby', 'Surround', '5.1', 'sound', 'included', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'too', 'many', 'sequences', 'would', 'take', 'advantage', 'Subtitles', 'included', 'are', 'English', 'deaf', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'Spanish.Several', 'extras', 'are', 'included', 'editions', 'are', 'listed', '*', 'extra', 'audio', 'track', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Producers', 'Lucas', 'Foster', 'Alan', 'Siegel', 'little', 'could', 'actually', 'check', 'was', 'interesting', 'acknowledge', 'plot', 'holes', 'had', 'fill', 'production', 'notes', 'like', 'so', 'liked', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'listen', 'Justice', ""'Law"", 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'featuring', 'cast', 'crew', 'actual', 'LA', 'prosecutor', 'talking', 'legal', 'ramifications', 'case', 'film', '*', 'Law', 'Black', 'White', 'Scenes', 'black', 'white', 'piece', 'scenes', '*', 'Preliminary', 'Arguments', 'Visual', 'Effects', ""'Law"", 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'highlights', 'sequences', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'describe', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'people', 'who', 'not', 'watched', 'FX', 'them.Also', 'included', 'Verdict', 'Winning', 'Trailer', 'Mash-Up', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'additional', 'trailers', 'forThe', 'Men', 'Who', 'Stare', 'Goats', 'Capitalism', 'Love', 'Story', 'Spartacus', 'Blood', 'Sand']",N/A

1298036,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B002XMGGJM,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[2, 3]","This is the kind of movie where you route for the success of the man doing all the killing.  Clyde's wife is raped, and she and his daughter are murdered by two men right in front of him in a home invasion robbery and murder.Nick, the prosecutor (Jamie Foxx), plea-bargains with one of the men to sell out the other in this crime.  The end result is that the man who raped and killed Clyde's wife gets a reduced sentence and is pretty much set free, while the other guy (who didn't do any killing, just robbery) is actually sent to death row.So, what makes you mad about this movie is how our judicial system works.  Nick, the prosecutor is more concerned about winning his case, than he is about actually seeking justice for the man whose family was murdered.So Clyde (Gerard Butler), a rightfully angry man of whom justice just disregarded him, calculates a well orchestrated plan to deliver his own brand of justice and actually go after all the participants of the prosecuting case that wronged him, including Clyde's wife's rapist.  Although, Clyde's main enemy in this revenge is Nick the Prosecutor.So, Clyde studies how law works and learns all the things that it takes for him to maintain his rights in a way that the prosecutor and judge cannot touch him.  And people are dying all around Nick the Prosecutor, where we believe that Nick's death will be last so that he can see Clyde takes his revenge on everyone else first.This movie was great to watch, until you get to the end where the judicial system once again wins to the disappointment of the viewing audience.  When Clyde was about to deliver that final blow to the whole courthouse and the rest of the city's judicial members that represent law and order, it is thwarted by Nick and his assistant.  Clyde dies sitting on his own bomb.  This was so disappointing.  So, the man who had to watch his own family die, is killed by the prosecutor who set his family's murderer free.If I were allowed to write the ending of this movie, I would have had Clyde successfully kill Nick's wife and daughter, and then let Nick the Prosecutor, live with the very kind of outcome that he creates as justice for other victims.  Unfortunately, this movie ended with just what might have been a realistic ending:No justice.  None from the beginning, and none at the end.Although, I don't endorse murder of any kind, I do believe Clyde should have had the right to kill his family's killer. If Nick the Prosecutor had to do anything it took to win his case, he should have at least allowed Clyde the liberty of killing his family's murderer himself.  If Nick the Prosecutor was a fair and decent man, he would have given Clyde all the information needed for Clyde to hunt him down and take his revenge on only him. No one else would have to get hurt. This would be deemed fair by the American majority.  This would be closer to justice.  Don't you think?If Clyde killed Nick's family and let Nick the Prosecutor live on without his family, that would make this a more justified and enjoyable film.  I would definitely want to own it then.I hated the ending here. I was just so disgusted!",3,"A portrait of a true American hero.

1298045,A14Q5D3QYA8FPV,B002XMGGJM,Shopper,"[2, 4]","Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler), a gadget inventor and a self described law abiding citizen, has lived the past decade with the unrelenting memory of the brutal murder and rape of his wife and daughter; a memory made worse by the fact that, while the murderer's accomplice received a death sentence for his crime, the actual killer escaped with but a few years in jail. Shelton is blaming the entire Philadelphia justice department for this unfair deal, particularly though the ambitious assistant DA Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx). Not wanting to risk his 96% conviction rate, Rice made the deal with the killer after a series of investigative blunders threatened to set both criminals free. Starting at the moment of the execution of one of the perpetrators, Shelton unleashes his cold and bloody revenge on both the killers as well as the justice department, hoping his actions will reveal the hypocrisy and bring the entire institution down. Though he quickly and almost cheerfully makes his intentions clear to Rice, not even solitary confinement in a maximum security prison can ease Shelton's grip on his revenge plans, with Rice clearly being one of his intended victims. Is Shelton just a brilliant inventor, or someone far more sinister? Who is providing assistance to him outside the prison? Can they be stopped before crippling the city of Philadelphia with their reign of terror?As one settles to view what is promising to be a gripping tale, disappointment soon replaces glee. The story has a few clever twists and turns, as well as (long) moments of absurd and lunacy. Unfortunately, the balance is tipped toward the latter. Lack of logic frequently peers from behind the weak script, spoiling one's enjoyment of the fast action. The action evolves around the heroes' fight for answers and survival. However, the impact of this race against time is severely undermined by the lack of a protagonist. The viewer doesn't care who lives or dies. Gruesome and unnecessary brutality as well as Butler's inexplicably gratuitous nudity disturb and baffle, respectively. The abruptly sugar sweet ending departs vastly from the general ""feel"" of the movie, delivering the final blow to the credibility of the film's plot.I really wanted to like this one.

I know that sounds like the start to a bad joke one would probably here in a bar, but that's exactly the point, this movie is a joke and nothing in it can be taken seriously.  The general premise of the film is to attempt to reap in the benefits of these other franchises by mixing in essential pieces from each respective film/series and blatantly plagiarize them with little to no integrity or reasoning.The plot of film begins in a manner similar to the hit TV series &#34;Dexter&#34;.  A man saw his wife and daughter killed before his eyes and decides to take the law into his own hands and kill the men responsible for their deaths.  This is the main focus of the TV series &#34;Dexter&#34;, however, in that show the morale and reasoning behind what Dexter does is much more logical and rational, not to mention it is much more believable.  &#34;Law Abiding Citizen&#34; would have been a much better movie had the entire film had simply been focused on Girard's character spending the duration of the movie tracking down his family's two killers and getting revenge at the end of the film.  Instead, viewers see that entire part of the plot dispersed within the first 15 minutes of the film, and from there the director and writers seemed to just keep grasping for straws with what to do next.The movie takes a turn to nonsensical dribble and lackluster writing filled with more holes than a country dirt road.  Girard's character suddenly falls victim to horrible writing, where more and more unnecessary traits are added to his character just to give the writer and director a reason to kill someone or blow something up.  The film reminds of me when children pretend to be superheroes and they keep making up superpowers in order to stay invincible.  There is no rationality or explanations behind any of it, it is completely random and derailing to the believability of the already thin plot.The director focused too much on trying to make a political statement about the justice system and not enough time and direction or storyline.  Too many scenes are completely unrealistic, for example: why was a prisoner in solitary confinement, especially of his caliber, left unguarded 24/7 instead of having a guard outside his cell at all times?  If he was as intellectual and dangerous as the director wants us to believe then how come his family was killed in the first place yet now he's impervious to all attempts of justice?  Not to mention that the final scene would not have occurred if Girard's character was as smart as the viewer is forced to believe.In the end, &#34;Law Abiding Citizen&#34; comes up short of having any lasting appeal.  The film tries to take too many other series and blend them together; however, in this case, the results from the formula turns out to be lesser than the sum of its parts.  If you want a movie about a serial killer who outsmarts the cops but is believable, go watch any of the Hannibal films.  If you want a movie that is just focused on creative revenge and has an underlining theme of becoming a better person by paying for your actions, then go watch any of the Saw films.  If you want a series about taking the law into your own hands because the justice system is broken, then go watch Dexter.  All of these have much better writing, more memorable scenes and characters and are much more believable than the concoction that &#34;Law Abiding Citizen&#34; wants its audience to drink.",2,nonsensical Plot with More Holes than Substance,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,3544,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'cross', 'Saw', 'Dexter', 'throw', 'Batman', 'Hannibal', 'mix', 'know', 'start', 'bad', 'joke', 'one', 'would', 'probably', 'here', 'bar', 'exactly', 'point', 'movie', 'joke', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'general', 'premise', 'film', 'attempt', 'reap', 'benefits', 'other', 'franchises', 'mixing', 'essential', 'pieces', 'respective', 'film/series', 'blatantly', 'plagiarize', 'little', 'integrity', 'reasoning.The', 'plot', 'film', 'begins', 'manner', 'similar', 'hit', 'TV', 'series', '34', 'Dexter', '34', 'man', 'saw', 'wife', 'daughter', 'killed', 'eyes', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'kill', 'men', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'main', 'focus', 'TV', 'series', '34', 'Dexter', '34', 'however', 'show', 'morale', 'reasoning', 'what', 'Dexter', 'much', 'more', 'logical', 'rational', 'not', 'mention', 'much', 'more', 'believable', '34', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', '34', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'had', 'entire', 'film', 'had', 'simply', 'been', 'focused', 'Girard', 'character', 'spending', 'duration', 'movie', 'tracking', 'down', 'family', 'two', 'killers', 'getting', 'revenge', 'end', 'film', 'Instead', 'viewers', 'see', 'entire', 'part', 'plot', 'dispersed', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'director', 'writers', 'seemed', 'just', 'keep', 'grasping', 'straws', 'what', 'do', 'next.The', 'movie', 'turn', 'nonsensical', 'dribble', 'lackluster', 'writing', 'filled', 'more', 'holes', 'country', 'dirt', 'road', 'Girard', 'character', 'suddenly', 'victim', 'horrible', 'writing', 'where', 'more', 'more', 'unnecessary', 'traits', 'are', 'added', 'character', 'just', 'give', 'writer', 'director', 'reason', 'kill', 'someone', 'blow', 'something', 'up', 'film', 'reminds', 'when', 'children', 'pretend', 'be', 'superheroes', 'keep', 'making', 'up', 'superpowers', 'order', 'stay', 'invincible', 'rationality', 'explanations', 'completely', 'random', 'derailing', 'believability', 'already', 'thin', 'plot.The', 'director', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'trying', 'make', 'political', 'statement', 'justice', 'system', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'direction', 'storyline', 'Too', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'example', 'why', 'was', 'prisoner', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'especially', 'caliber', 'left', 'unguarded', '24/7', 'instead', 'having', 'guard', 'cell', 'times', 'was', 'intellectual', 'dangerous', 'director', 'believe', 'then', 'how', 'come', 'family', 'was', 'killed', 'first', 'place', 'yet', 'now', 'impervious', 'attempts', 'justice', 'Not', 'mention', 'final', 'scene', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'occurred', 'Girard', 'character', 'was', 'as', 'smart', 'viewer', 'forced', 'believe.In', 'end', '34', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', '34', 'up', 'short', 'having', 'lasting', 'appeal', 'film', 'take', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'series', 'blend', 'together', 'however', 'case', 'results', 'formula', 'out', 'be', 'lesser', 'sum', 'parts', 'want', 'movie', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'cops', 'believable', 'go', 'watch', 'Hannibal', 'films', 'want', 'movie', 'just', 'focused', 'creative', 'revenge', 'underlining', 'theme', 'becoming', 'better', 'person', 'paying', 'actions', 'then', 'go', 'watch', 'Saw', 'films', 'want', 'series', 'taking', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'justice', 'system', 'broken', 'then', 'go', 'watch', 'Dexter', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'writing', 'more', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'concoction', '34', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', '34', 'audience', 'drink']",N/A
1298048,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B002XMGGJM,Sky,"[17, 25]","I actually got Law Abiding Citizen by accident from Netflix. I was supposed to get2012, but oddly it was Law Abiding Citizen in the 2012 case. They sent me out 2012 when I reported the issue and I watched that first. Oy, what a mistake that was, because 2012 wasn't a Disaster Movie it was a movie disaster! Anyway...Law Abiding Citizen was a lot better than 2012. In fact as the movie played out, I thought to myself, ""what a great movie."" Even as the credits rolled I felt thoroughly entertained by the movie I had just watched. It had a lot of action, suspense, and it kept me guessing right up to the very end.Then as I reflected on the film I thought more about how silly the premise of the movie is and how far-fetched what the antihero (Gerard Butler) pulls off really is. I'd love to go into detail, but I'm struggling to do so without giving away the critical twists and turns of the movie.So let me just say this: with Law Abiding Citizen you get a pretty decent thriller about a guy (Butler) that you don't want to mess with who a couple home-invaders do indeed mess with. The bad guys get caught and Butler allows the DA (Jamie Foxx) to exact this great country's due process on the bad guys...which fails. So Butler sets a plan to take out the bad guys himself and anyone else that was involved in the failure of Due Process of Law.But man, the way this guy chooses to make his point, and the way he ultimately carries it out are where you'll be saying, ""Hold on a second there."" So check your brain at the door as I did, sit back and enjoy. It's like the small rollercoaster in the amusement park...it's fun while you're riding it, but after you get off you realize it wasn't that great.",3,Go to Jail,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,1701,"['actually', 'got', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'accident', 'Netflix', 'was', 'supposed', 'get2012', 'oddly', 'was', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', '2012', 'case', 'sent', 'out', '2012', 'when', 'reported', 'issue', 'watched', 'first', 'Oy', 'what', 'mistake', 'was', '2012', 'was', ""n't"", 'Disaster', 'Movie', 'was', 'movie', 'disaster', 'Anyway', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'was', 'lot', 'better', '2012', 'fact', 'movie', 'played', 'out', 'thought', 'myself', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'Even', 'credits', 'rolled', 'felt', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'movie', 'had', 'just', 'watched', 'had', 'lot', 'action', 'suspense', 'kept', 'guessing', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'end.Then', 'reflected', 'film', 'thought', 'more', 'how', 'silly', 'premise', 'movie', 'how', 'far-fetched', 'what', 'antihero', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'really', ""'d"", 'love', 'go', 'detail', ""'m"", 'struggling', 'do', 'so', 'giving', 'away', 'critical', 'twists', 'turns', 'movie.So', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'get', 'pretty', 'decent', 'thriller', 'guy', 'Butler', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'mess', 'who', 'couple', 'home-invaders', 'do', 'indeed', 'mess', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'caught', 'Butler', 'DA', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'exact', 'great', 'country', 'due', 'process', 'bad', 'guys', 'So', 'Butler', 'plan', 'take', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'anyone', 'else', 'was', 'involved', 'failure', 'Due', 'Process', 'Law.But', 'man', 'way', 'guy', 'make', 'point', 'way', 'ultimately', 'out', 'are', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'saying', 'Hold', 'second', 'there', 'So', 'check', 'brain', 'door', 'did', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'small', 'rollercoaster', 'amusement', 'park', 'fun', ""'re"", 'riding', 'get', 'realize', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'great']",N/A

I am only concerned with the transfer to Blu Ray.You are provided 2 discs, one has the extended version and the other the theatrical version plus extras.  Since I have this movie on Standard Def and enjoyed it, I thought I might like an extended version on Blu Ray.  There are 10 additional minutes added to the extended version but most of the new or extended scenes, I barely noticed as they really didn't add a whole lot to the movie.  Never the less, they are there and inclusive within the film.On the 1st disc, which is the extended version, there are many previews of other movies and TV shows.  I hated when they do this, I truly do as they just take up valuable room on the disc itself that could go into more extras, cut scenes, less compression in the transfer or any other number of  worthy things.The video transfer is good,  not great, just good.  The standard def version was also good so I don't think you will have an eye popping epiphany of visual delights.  However, there were no artifacts or aliasing and I didn't see any grain to speak of so the transfer to blu ray was pretty decent.The audio transfer to DDHD 5.1 made good use of the front sound stage with some deep bottom end in several parts.  The rear channels were not used very often but some discreet audio to the rears was present, just not too often.This is a fun movie to watch and I am glad to have it now on Blu Ray, however, don't buy it thinking it will be used as a Demo disc to impress yourself or your friends.Now that Amazon has changed their fees in CA to include sales tax, while they are at work on their website, would it be possible that they could separate the standard DVD reviews from the Blu Ray or new versions as they come out.

The supplements help answer a few questions and include:* A six-minute interview session of some legal ""experts"" about the law issues seen in the film.* Behind the scenes in black and white, 15 minutes. Interviews/set footage in black and white while the film clips shown are in color. Not quite sure what the contrast reasoning was, but the director kept saying how he wanted this film to be different than the other movies that might be categorized as similar.* VFX snippets, 5 of them at 6:30 minutes. Was disappointed in some of the effects shots they thought were ""great"" (snow on a sunny clear day - and viewers are supposed to miss that?)...but at least they covered what the original ending was going to be - much better than what was installed.* Disc 2 - Director's Cut - much better version of the film. 10 minutes longer and had a variety of additions, including:++ Longer version of the first meeting with Butler's character regarding the plea (you only see the paper under Foxx's phone in theatrical).++ Joke by defense attorney in court - shows why everyone was looking at him funny in the theatrical.++ Nice vulgarity by the female prosecutor in the execution chamber scene.++ Torture scene much longer.++ More footage of the torture chamber when found by the police.++ Footage of Colm Meaney wanting to head shot Butler in the prison yard gate sequence.++ A bunch of dialogue bits and longer takes - added more edge to the film and gave it a much better R version than shown.Two versions of the same film on two different BDs, almost makes it to where you want to get rid of the disc you will never watch depending on your likes/dislikes.

1298059,A19YOYY7FLQMA6,B002XMGGJM,"Tante Maren ""Maren""","[0, 0]","Law Abiding Citizen kept me watching from beginning to end and that always rates above average for me. The movie begins with an engineer named Clyde Shelton (played by Gerard Butler), at home with his wife and little daughter, when the family is attacked by two home invaders, who go beyond robbing and rape into murder. Clyde survives even after being stabbed, but his wife and little daughter do not. When Philadelphia prosecutor Nicholas Rice (played by Jamie Foxx) fails to put both the home invaders away, due to the one turning evidence against the other to get off, this is when Clyde can't mentally deal with the way the legal system works.Ten years go by and then interesting things start to happen. It seems as if Clyde has had plenty of time to figure out how he will get back at the murderer who got off. Clyde gets his revenge, and admits to the murder to Rice. Clyde is then sent off to prison, but more murders keep happening to anyone who was involved in court the day of the trial for the murders of Shelton's family. This is when the movie starts to move quickly and keeps you wondering how this revenge can be orchestrated with the main suspect behind bars.I am a huge fan of great Hitchcock suspense action films and I always like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood type vengeance. Bad people getting it is always a good ending, and in true Hitchcock fashion, never quite knowing who will get it next or how they'll get it, really keeps you watching.

1298060,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B002XMGGJM,Terence Allen,"[2, 4]","""Law Abiding Citizen,"" the new thriller with Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx, is an interesting revenge thriller that takes the viewer to some unexpected places and provokes thoughtful conversations and introspection. Regardless of any drawbacks that the film may have, and it is certainly not perfect, it makes valid points about the sometimes arbitrary nature of the criminal justice system.Gerard Butler stars as an engineer whose seemingly peaceful life is shattered when two men break into his house, injure him, and kill his wife and daughter. Grieving, but obviously believing that his case is clear cut, he is stunned when the young assistant DA prosecuting the case, played by Jamie Foxx, makes a deal that allows a reduced sentence for the killer of the wife and child in exchange for his testimony against the other man.Ten years later, as the man convicted of murder is facing lethal injection, Butler's long-planned revenge plot begins to unfold. We find out that Butler is not who he has seemed to be, and that the now senior assistant DA Foxx has his hand full with a clever resourceful advesary.This film is not for the squeamish, has several shocks and surprises, and is meditative and thoughtful. It is a suprisingly good thriller considering how bad it could have been with a lesser cast, script, and direction.",4,"Clever, Entertaining Thriller",1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,1327,"['Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'new', 'thriller', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'interesting', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'viewer', 'unexpected', 'places', 'provokes', 'thoughtful', 'conversations', 'introspection', 'Regardless', 'drawbacks', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'certainly', 'not', 'perfect', 'valid', 'points', 'sometimes', 'arbitrary', 'nature', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system.Gerard', 'Butler', 'stars', 'engineer', 'seemingly', 'peaceful', 'life', 'shattered', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'break', 'house', 'injure', 'kill', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Grieving', 'obviously', 'believing', 'case', 'clear', 'cut', 'stunned', 'when', 'young', 'assistant', 'DA', 'prosecuting', 'case', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'deal', 'reduced', 'sentence', 'killer', 'wife', 'child', 'exchange', 'testimony', 'other', 'man.Ten', 'years', 'later', 'man', 'convicted', 'murder', 'facing', 'lethal', 'injection', 'Butler', 'long-planned', 'revenge', 'plot', 'unfold', 'find', 'out', 'Butler', 'not', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'now', 'senior', 'assistant', 'DA', 'Foxx', 'hand', 'full', 'clever', 'resourceful', 'advesary.This', 'film', 'not', 'squeamish', 'several', 'shocks', 'surprises', 'meditative', 'thoughtful', 'suprisingly', 'good', 'thriller', 'considering', 'how', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lesser', 'cast', 'script', 'direction']",N/A

1298062,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B002XMGGJM,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[0, 1]","First, let me say the R rating for this film is well deserved.  Give me a few sentences to compose my thoughts and try to avoid potential spoilers this early in the review and I'll explain my reasoning behind that statement.  (I hate when reviewers give away spoilers without warning, especially when they needn't do so, so I really do try to avoid that myself.)I guess I'll start with a quick run-down of the trailers/opening advertisements for this disc.  First up, a trailer for the 2010 version of The Crazies.  The best part of that portion/segment, the haunting Andrews/Jules cover of the song Mad World (also used as a theme in the advertising for the Xbox 360 gameGears of War (2-Disc Edition)).  Ok, I know, that's just my opinion, but I do love that version of the song.  Actually, with Timothy Olyphant starring in this new version of The Crazies, I might actually be interested in watching it when it's out later.Next up an ad for the George Clooney/Ewan McGregor filmThe Men Who Stare At Goats.  I do want to catch that one when I get a chance.Michael Moore'sCapitalism: A Love Storygets the 3rd slot.  Pass on that one for me.And finally, well, no not the feature/main menu yet, there's an ad for the new Starz! series Spartacus: Blood and Sand.  Plenty of sex and blood ooozing from the ad for that one (but no, that's still not why I would say this film deserved the R rating.  It might be why the preview might, but it's not why the film does).Ok, finally we're at the main menu for the disc.  Here's where you may encounter a few spoilers for this film, but given how long it took me to get here, please don't say you weren't warned.  Again, the following thoughts and comments are highly likely to contain spoilers for the film or at least provide several clear clues as to what to expect from the film.  If you don't want to know in advance, then don't continue reading here.Once we're finally at the main menu we get the pleasure of hitting start to begin playing the 109 minute feature film.  It starts off friendly enough.  Daddy/Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is busy working on some electronic item while daughter is busy making bracelets and necklaces.  Mommy is off somewhere else in the house but fusses at daddy to answer the door when someone comes knocking.  Apparently no one told the stars of the film in advance that this was going to be this kind of film and that they shouldn't have answered the door.  (Apparently the family was too cheap to put a peep hole in the door, or have a dog to help protect the family, or other similar things.)  Before you know it daddy is near death while mommy is on the floor dieing in front of him and daughter is about to be severely harmed.  We're spared the actual gore for that event, as we find ourselves seeing hotshot prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) talking to a co-worker about their respective careers.We find out that Rice has a stellar conviction rate that he doesn't want to endanger by going to trial on a case that he could potentially lose.  Rather than blow a possible conviction he decides that he's going to plea bargain with one of Shelton's killers.  By making the deal he guarantees that one of the killers will face a death sentence with the other getting a lighter sentence for his cooperation.  Never mind that the killer that is getting the lighter sentence is the worse of the two (and is the one that actually did the killing), the justice system being what it is, Rice takes the bird in the hand and is left to tell Shelton that this is the best he can do.  Shelton is, of course, unhappy with this as he expected justice, but if he got it, well we'd have no movie, would we?10 years later Rice is in attendance when killer #1 (actually, he was killer #2, but who cares, right?) is having his death sentence carried out.  Killer gives a short speech noting that as god as his witness, he didn't do it, and then the system goes to work.  Except, well, from that point on nothing goes as Rice would expect.  The Killer has his sentence carried out, but rather than being a quiet, peaceful death, cruel and unusual punishment is the order of the day.  Someone must have tampered with the equipment, but who could have or would have done such a thing?Soon killer #2 (who was really killer #1) is getting a phone call tipping him off that the police are about to catch him on a third strike that would have him going to jail for a long time.  He starts running away immediately but gets another call that helps point him towards freedom.  Or so he thinks.  It's not long before we find him stretched out on a table about to meet the star of theSawfilms.  THIS WOULD BE THE PART THAT CLEARLY DESERVES THE R-RATING!Rice continues investigating and assumes that Shelton has taken revenge, though Shelton seems to ready to admit his guilt immediately.  Just as Rice is about to take his confession and run with it, Shelton reminds him that Rice has nothing even close to the legal standard that would be required to get a conviction.  Soon enough both men are in court with Rice asking the judge to keep Shelton in jail rather than released on bond.  Soon we're seeing a scene that reminded me of the Kirkland (Al Pacino) character's great blow-up in the film...And Justice For All.I'll stop the summary here, but note that I could note similarities between elements of say the TV seriesPrison Break - Season One, along withTaken (Single-Disc Extended Edition)and several other films (and books, TV shows, etc.)In the end I though the film was fine, but really nothing special enough to leave me sad at the thought of missing it.  I'm glad that I got to see it, but wouldn't run out to spend a bunch of my disposable income on this one.  Go with on-demand if possible so you can save a little of your movie buying budget.",3,Well deserved R rating for this suspense-thriller,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,5810,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'R',

It looked like some kind of quasi-SAW/evil terrorist action-drama and didnt really get to the crux of what it was about.  What a shame......because this movie is actually a commentary on the legal system and frankly a populist bomb dropped in the lap of ""The Man"".  It wastes no time getting you to buy-in to Gerard Butler's familial angst, and perhaps unintentionally, never gets you to NOT root for the bad guy.  Despite Butler's heinous crimes, the legal system is still worse, and you end up disliking Jamie Fox's character throughout because of this.  The ending doesnt change this at all, although it really couldnt have had a different end result ultimately.  I'm trying to be vague for those that havent seen it.Over-the-top?  Perhaps, but it does bring to light what might happen if the right person with the right resources decided that they needed to make an example of the broken legal system, both for retribution and to strike a blow for ""everyman"".

Ten years later, the man who got away with murder is found dead and Clyde Shelton admits his guilt, issuing a warning to Nick: either fix the flawed justice system that failed his family or key players in the trial will die.The film addresses the weakness of the justice system while providing plenty of action.

1298066,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B002XMGGJM,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[1, 2]","I wasn't sure what I was going to get going into this movie.  I can recall this film, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" being in the theaters for like five seconds.  This could either be a good thing or bad thing nowadays.  Nevertheless after watching this movie, I feel that this movie had potential but seemed to miss the mark.The premise is somewhat simple.  Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is attacked and witnessed both his wife and daughter's murder.  After the two men who committed this crime are caught, Shelton's attorney, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) tells him that he should make a deal.  This deal would put one of the murders in death row and the other will receive a reduced sentence.  This technique would assure that these ""crooks"" will have to pay for their crimes.  Shelton protests this approach, but Rice tells him it is too late and the deal has already been made.Fast forward ten years.  Clyde Shelton has spent a great deal of time orchestrating his revenge.  This isn't just limited to the men who actually killed his wife and daughter.  Anyone who was involved with the legal and/or justice process better keep looking over their shoulder.  This really comes back to haunt Rice, since after all he was Shelton's lawyer.  The insane thing is Shelton conducts the majority of his revenge from his jail cell.These conditions really set things in motion for one intense thriller/action movie.  However, after about half way through the movie, I felt the movie became befuddled and going astray.  It is difficult for me to explain why I feel this way without revealing many details of the film.  I will do my best.Shelton's revenge is both intelligent and brutal.  This is evident by his astute candor when speaking to a judge about the justice process and chopping a person up with a buzz saw.  I really felt the spirit of Charles Bronson in many of these scenes.  Rice is faced with dualism at its best.  He empathizes with Shelton but still feels he needs to uphold the law.There were too many loop holes in this movie.  The following are examples as such.-It was never explained why Clyde Shelton and his family were targeted in the first place.  This resulted in a lame MacGuffin.-Clyde Shelton's body count and havoc continues while he is in prison, but no one every assigns a guard and/or has a security camera on his prison cell.-Many ""important figures"" are killed as a result of Shelton's wrath and only the local police are involved.-Shelton is permitted to do what he wants and is granted total impunity.  (The legal system isn't perfect, but come on).The performances by Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler were rather good.  I found both of them to be very believable.  (I still see Butler as Dracula from ""Dracula 2000"".)  I also found the supporting performances wonderful as well.  Bruce McGill, Viola Davis, Leslie Bibb and Gregory Itzin were all awesome.If there were anyway the last half hour or so of this movie could be re-worked.  I strongly believed this would not only result in a better movie, but it would have made a statement.  Just like ""Death Wish"" made oh so many moons ago.  Sadly, the movie reached a plateau of nonsense that basically undermined and contradicted what its gimmick was in the first place.  Don't get me wrong, it was a fun ride but I felt less than satisfied when the credits rolled.",3,A great premise which equals an okay movie,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,3327,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'going', 'movie', 'can', 'recall', 'film', 'Law', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', 'being', 'theaters', 'five', 'seconds', 'could', 'either', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'bad', 'thing', 'nowadays', 'Nevertheless', 'watching', 'movie', 'feel', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'seemed', 'miss', 'mark.The', 'premise', 'somewhat', 'simple', 'Clyde', 'Shelton', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'attacked', 'witnessed', 'wife', 'daughter', 'murder', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'committed', 'crime', 'are', 'caught', 'Shelton', 'attorney', 'Nick', 'Rice', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'should', 'make', 'deal', 'deal', 'would', 'put', 'one', 'murders', 'death', 'row', 'other', 'will', 'receive', 'reduced', 'sentence', 'technique', 'would', 'assure', 'crooks', 'will', 'have', 'pay', 'crimes', 'Shelton', 'approach', 'Rice', 'too', 'late', 'deal', 'already', 'been', 'made.Fast', 'forward', 'ten', 'years', 'Clyde', 'Shelton', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'orchestrating', 'revenge', ""n't"", 'just', 'limited', 'men', 'who', 'actually', 'killed', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Anyone', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'legal', 'and/or', 'justice', 'process', 'better', 'keep', 'looking', 'shoulder', 'really', 'back', 'haunt', 'Rice', 'was', 'Shelton', 'lawyer', 'insane', 'thing', 'Shelton', 'majority', 'revenge', 'jail', 'cell.These', 'conditions', 'really', 'set', 'things', 'motion', 'one', 'intense', 'thriller/action', 'movie', 'However', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'felt', 'movie', 'became', 'befuddled', 'going', 'astray', 'difficult', 'explain', 'why', 'feel', 'way', 'revealing', 'many', 'details', 'film', 'will', 'do', 'best.Shelton', 'revenge', 'intelligent', 'brutal', 'evident', 'astute', 'candor', 'when', 'speaking', 'judge', 'justice', 'process', 'chopping', 'person', 'up', 'buzz', 'saw', 'really', 'felt', 'spirit', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'many', 'scenes', 'Rice', 'faced', 'dualism', 'best', 'Shelton', 'still', 'uphold', 'law.There', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'loop', 'holes', 'movie', 'following', 'are', 'examples', 'such.-It', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'why', 'Clyde', 'Shelton', 'family', 'were', 'targeted', 'first', 'place', 'resulted', 'lame', 'MacGuffin.-Clyde', 'Shelton', 'body', 'count', 'havoc', 'prison', 'one', 'guard', 'and/or', 'security', 'camera', 'prison', 'cell.-Many', 'important', 'figures', 'are', 'killed', 'result', 'Shelton', 'wrath', 'only', 'local', 'police', 'are', 'involved.-Shelton', 'permitted', 'do', 'what', 'granted', 'total', 'impunity', 'legal', 'system', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'come', '.The', 'performances', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'were', 'rather', 'good', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'believable', 'still', 'see', 'Butler', 'Dracula', 'Dracula', '2000', 'also', 'found', 'supporting', 'performances', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'Bruce', 'McGill', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'Gregory', 'Itzin', 'were', 'awesome.If', 'were', 'anyway', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 're-worked', 'strongly', 'believed', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'result', 'better', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'statement', 'Just', 'Death', 'Wish', 'made', 'oh', 'so', 'many', 'moons', 'ago', 'Sadly', 'movie', 'reached', 'plateau', 'nonsense', 'basically', 'undermined', 'contradicted', 'what', 'gimmick', 'was', 'first', 'place', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'fun', 'ride', 'felt', 'less', 'satisfied', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled']",N/A

1298068,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002XMGGJM,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[10, 24]","""Law Abiding Citizen"", the new film starring Gerard Butler (in his third film in six months) and Jamie Foxx, is one of those films that seems to be recycled from elements from other films. It is almost as though someone said lets make a film about a father who seeks revenge, like in ""Death Wish"", throw in some legal maneuvers, like any John Grisham film, throw in some shots of a crazy man imprisoned in a special cell, like in ""Silence of the Lambs"", and throw in some good old grisly torture scenes, like in so many 'torture porn' films. The mix is so new, so fresh, that it is original. It will be a huge hit.Yes, the mix is new, but when you take well-known elements from questionable films and simply combine them, you end up with a mess, a mess that most people will be able to spot as a recycled piece of crap and stay away from the multiplex.For the unlucky few that do actually go to watch this film, it will not be a pleasant experience.But there is an overriding thought, a glimmer of hope carrying the viewer through the experience. When even this idea is purposely discarded, you might leave the theater as upset as I was.Clyde Shelton (Butler) returns home one evening to his loving wife and child. There is a knock at the door and two men barge in and tie everyone up. They leave Clyde alive to watch as his wife is murdered and then raped by Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte). The two men then walk towards Clyde's daughter's room as he blacks out. A few months later, Deputy District Attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) has accepted a plea bargain from Darby who will testify against his partner for a reduced sentence of a few years in prison. Darby's partner will receive the death penalty. Clyde is enraged and can't believe the Deputy DA won't take the case to court. He saw both men and will ID them, but Rice doesn't want to take a chance on a trial that might impact his conviction rate negatively. Clyde is one very upset man Ten years later, as Darby's accomplice faces lethal injection; Rice brings his younger prot&eacute;g&eacute; to the prison to watch. But something goes wrong, horribly wrong and the man dies a painful death. A few hours later, as the police zero in on Darby (who has since been released from prison) Clyde kidnaps the criminal and takes him to one of his own warehouses. The fact that Clyde now owns a number of properties is a long, complicated part of the story. When Darby wakes up, he finds himself strapped down to a worktable with various needles in him. Clyde, wearing a mask, turns on a video recorder and begins to extract revenge. Thus begins an elaborate tale of cat and mouse as Clyde attempts to extract revenge on all of those people responsible for his wife and child's murderers going free. In other words, he begins to extract revenge on the entire legal system.""Law Abiding Citizen"" spends a lot of time making us feel sympathetic for Clyde. And it does a good job of it, we feel sympathetic for Clyde even as he begins to extract his revenge and start killing off all of the Deputy DAs, policemen, judges, elected officials and more who he feels were responsible for the lack of punishment for the murders of his family. And the film spends a lot of time making us sort of loathe the very ground Rice walks on. Again, it does a good job of making him seem slightly good, possibly more crooked and oily than he should be. The end result seems clear. Then the filmmakers throw other elements into the mix. As the film opens, Rice's wife is pregnant and they have just moved into a new house. Ten years later, they have a beautiful daughter and a beautiful house. Surely, Clyde won't do anything to them, it would make him seem too similar to Darby and erase a lot of the sympathy we have for him. Surely, Rice will feel a little more empathetic to Clyde now that he has a girl of his own. Surely, he can relate more?But the film decides to buck the trend. Clyde does in fact do something that brings some terror into the lives of Nick's daughter and wife. It isn't much, but it does open the eyes of both Nick and the viewer. Clyde means business and he doesn't care if he ruffles a few young feathers to get the message across. Unfortunately, this does serve to make him also less empathetic. It makes the story more interesting, because he is willing to go to any lengths.As the film proceeds, you become aware of a point where the character development stops and the story simply becomes a tale of revenge. F. Gary Gray, the director of such films as ""The Italian Job"" and ""Be Cool"" and his screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (""Street Kings"", ""The Recruit"") seem more interested in this aspect of the story as well. Each of the executions seems designed to provide a little puzzle for Rice and his team and to illustrate the extent Clyde will go in order to extract revenge. Some of these are interesting, surprising, even a little over the top even if they seem better suited to the newest ""Final Destination"" film rather than a film about a mourning father extracting revenge. But they don't help to provide character development.And I was willing to go along for the ride. Clyde deserves revenge because he is given a really raw deal and Butler makes us believe in his pain, his remorse and his determination to get revenge. I was willing to overlook the over-the-top ""Saw""-esque revenge scene and the cobbled together nature of the story. That is how successful Butler is at making us believe in his character.That is, I was willing to go along for the ride until the final act of the film begins to unfold. And perhaps this part of the film ruined the rest because of Foxx's inability to make us feel anything for his character, Nick Rice. Throughout the film, Rice is more than a little shady, more than a little crooked and willing to bend the rules to help his career advance. Later, after his wife and daughter receive a little threat from Clyde, he doesn't really change this very much and seems to continue along his merry path. Foxx is good at making us feel there is an underlying need for his character to get ahead, to advance to the next step in the system.But as the film winds down, everything we have been feeling for the two characters is supposed to change 180. And the two central characters aren't given the time or the material to make this happen. And because of this, the film fails. Miserably.As we left the theater, I remarked to my companion that the film's morality reflected the old gangster films of the thirties. You spend an hour or so with a gangster and learn to like him and then, because of the production code, he had to get ""what he deserved"" and either be arrested by the police or die. Unfortunately, this type of moral code doesn't fly with the film we have just watched and makes the entire thing seem like a waste of time.",1,Just A Mess of a Movie,1257379200,"11 5,

1298071,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B002XMGGJM,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[1, 1]","Movie - 4.0When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I didn't think much of it. It looked like it would've been a decent crime thriller or something of that sort, but, boy, was I wrong. Law Abiding Citizen, in fact, is a pretty good movie filled with heavy amounts of ethical and moral quandaries, metaphorical allusions to how people are responsible for their own actions, and is an eerie testament to the legal system's flaws and shortcomings. I was actually reminded a lot of The Count of Monte Cristo in how a man just loses everything, gets cheated by the system, and in about ten years time amasses a fortune to plan out this giant, masterful revenge plot against all those embedded within that system and those whom he feels have wronged both himself and the rest of society. Well, it's not as epic as the Dumas classic, but if the writers did, indeed, use it as some kind of inspiration, bravo. The thing that fascinates me the most about this film is the tension. Once you see the traumatic event that triggers Butler's character and the way he's unjustly justified through court (in a city that ironically prides itself on ""justice""), how can you blame the guy for going off the deep end and putting all this chaos into action? On top of that, I've yet to even mention the predicament of the law versus vigilantism. By now, I'm sure we've all seen some example or another of how operating outside ""the system"" can also be thoroughly more effective than the papers and red tape of the law, or at least that's the message I get from the ending. However, in the process I feel the movie also loses quite a bit of steam when certain plot points are revealed toward the end. I also feel that there isn't enough ""change"" to the system itself, so much as it is for just one person. Maybe it's to illustrate the futility of how the system can't be changed and how it continues to suck, or maybe they just wanted us to get the message that revenge isn't all it's cut up to be?Video - 4.5Law Abiding Citizen is brought to us by Starz / Anchor Bay in 1080p using the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (framed at 2.39). This is the first Starz / AB Blu-ray I've ever watched, so I wasn't sure what I was getting. But to tell you the truth, it's not so bad. The film's gritty nature reflects well in the photography, which leads to a darker color palette that more or less is as vibrant as it can be. Black levels, however, are excellent with darkness and shadows being the highlight of the presentation. Contrast is also surprisingly good given the amount of dimly-lit scenes. The only faults I have are with a little loss in texture and detail in some of the closeup shots and a few instances of debris popping up here and there, which is really weird considering most recent films usually have none.Audio - 4.5Despite all the dialogue, the movie also is very proficient with its TrueHD 5.1 track. The dialogue is clear and free of any anomalies, and surround usage is fairly immersive during prison and other facility takes. However, the real workout comes in the bigger action sequences and through various parts of Brian Tyler's score. High/low ends are deadly accurate for the cemetery scene, with LFEs exceeding my expectations for explosions. The score is fairly quiet when need be for certain parts of the movie, but when things start getting crazy, I feel it really helps establish a good mood for the fast pace. I wouldn't quite call this a reference disc, though, as a few parts of the movie didn't feel as engaging as I thought they'd be, but this is an excellent first-time listen for me.Extras - 3.0There's a commentary, two main bits about legal terminology and filming, a graphics progression bit, and a bunch of trailers. The legal terminology feature was what I found most interesting. It basically breaks down the logic and reasoning behind the decisions made at the beginning of the movie, as analyzed and explained by two former Philadelphia attorneys, and makes a lot of sense. The filming feature was a short, though unorganized, look at how they shot certain scenes, came up with ideas for the writing, and so on. It was interesting on a few parts, but not as detailed as I expected. I would've liked a more in-depth interview with director F. Gary Gray about the plot.Overall - 4.0The movie makes for some great, great drama, exploitation of the legal system, and ""what if"" dilemmas. Unfortunately, the ending is a bit of a downer in that it feels ""too easy"" and kind of loses the overall point of trying evoke change within ""the system."" But a large majority of the movie is still very good and very tense. Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx aren't on screen together a whole lot of the time, but it makes for a cool battle of wits when they do. With excellent A/V presentation and a decent set of extras, Law Abiding Citizen comes highly recommended.",4,Law Abiding Citizen (Blu-ray),1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,4893,"['Movie', '4.0When',

1298074,A3RICVFW2YD1LZ,B002XMGGJM,"T. Scarillo ""music snob""","[0, 1]","""Law Abiding Citizen"" is a taut thriller, with an intriguing premise:  What if a crime victim were able to exact revenge not only on the perpetrators of a crime, but also on law enforcement figures who issued a plea-bargain that set one perp free early?  Gerard Butler stars as a man whose wife and daughter are murdered by home invaders in the film's opening moments, and who is victimized a second time as he is powerless to stop a plea deal authorized by an assistant DA (played by Jamie Foxx).  After ten years pass, and one of the criminals is to be executed for the crime, mayhem breaks loose as Butler's character begins to take retribution on the criminals, the DA's office and the judiciary, even while imprisoned.  Foxx then is faced with having to stop Butler's character from killing, while Butler is actually IN prison and seemingly always one step ahead of law enforcement.  I won't go into too many more details, at the risk of spoiling some very interesting ideas/events in the film, but I will say that the film is quite good overall and will absolutely keep you guessing as to how Butler's character is pulling off his plot to achieve satisfaction/justice, though there are a couple of plot holes throughout and the ending had me somewhat scratching my head as to plausibility (in general, it's probably best to suspend a fair amount of disbelief with this film).  This film is best characterized as a combination of ""Seven"" & ""Saw"" (given some of the novel / graphic violence), ""Dr. Phibes"" (given the revenge/justice motif) and ""Taken"" (given something we learn about Butler's character about halfway thru the film).  Overall, well-cast, and pretty well-directed, it does tackle some issues involving the concept of true justice vs. plea-bargaining down heinous crimes (in the interest of not risking letting someone walk).  It aspires to be taken seriously, but I found it to be good entertainment (for a similarly-themed movie regarding the legal system's imperfections, from the bench's view, you might want to check out ""The Star Chamber"", from 1983).

Clarence (with whom Nick strikes a deal) will be convicted of third-degree murder, which means in a few years he will be released from the jail.You may call ""Law Abiding Citizen"" a revenge thriller, but this time the angry protagonist avenges the deaths of his family in the most unpredictable (and brutal) fashion.

That means Nick and those who are working with him (including Nick's mentor Jonas Cantrell played by Bruce McGill) are not safe ... even after Clyde is arrested.Like his ""The Negotiator"" F.

A prosecutor, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), catches the two killers, however Rice is forced to give one of the killers a light sentencing in exchange for testifying against his partner. The movie than is fast-forwarded ten years, and the man with the light sentencing is found dead. Shelton admits to Rice that he is guilty and issues Rice a warning to fix the justice system or people involved in the trial will die. Shelton is put behind bars, but people involved in the trial start to die. Rice has to try to find a way to stop Shelton and fast!This is not your typical revenge movie. Instead of taking the whole movie to finally see justice served to the ones that committed the crime, Shelton takes care of the two killers in the beginning. The main focus of the movie is Shelton taking on what he thinks is a corrupt justice system. He believes Rice could have done more in the trial instead of cutting a quick a deal with one of the killers. Overall the storyline of the movie was well thought out.Jamie Foxx vs. Gerard Butler. Both actors did a great job, and I especially liked the fierce rivalry between the two. In addition, both actors kept in character, however it seemed at times Jamie Foxx almost broke character. One of the main questions to ask is who really is the villain in the movie? Shelton or Rice? Through out the movie, you seem to want to sympathize with both characters.

This movie is suspenseful, offending, and brilliant in lots of ways. The justice system is very corrupt and definitely has a lot of flaws, is that any reason for someone to become a terrorist, well certainly not. The movie however does touch on some good points as Gerald Butlers character speaks out against a judge claiming, i'm guilty of a crime and you were just about to let me WALK! Not to give anything away but yes this kind of thing happens everyday. Jamie Foxxs character does sympathize at first but as things get more and more out of hand throughout the film he starts to realize he may have made a huge mistake. Gerald Butlers character becomes quite deranged and there is nothing that can be done about it. As far fetched as this seems, the film executes this process very well, even if it seems a bit overkill at times, it never goes beyond slightly plausible. The performances are great, and i especially like Gerald Butlers part since you really don't see him in a lot, but he goes toe to toe very well with Jamie Foxx. Also throughout the movie you can't help but think how Hugh Jackman would have played this role, since Butlers gruff, rugged, mumbled talking attitude reminds your a lot of him. At times you may forget and think thats who it is. So with all the explosions, deaths, and overall bleak atmosphere or the film, i think its dark gritty nature is just what we needed in films today.

They treat us like morons. They've ruined so many movies with unrealistic endings. Some of us live in the real world. Justice is not always fair or just. I love how the movie points out the flaws of the justice system. Hell life is full of flaws. I gave it 4 stars but that is being generous. Why? Because endings that don't flow with the rest of the movie are like WTF! I don't even mind endings that let your imagination fill in the blanks. But how do we go from Butler's character being brilliant throughout the whole film to Foxx beating him at the end. So they just magically decided to take a closer look at his finances. What a surprise, how did we miss this, oh yeah the movie needs to have the so-called villian taken down. I'm not saying I would enjoy people die in real life. But unfortunately real life has so many sad but true endings. Worth a rental but not a purchase.

I was always a follower of the Old Testament (an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth etc.) and the performance of Gerard Butler was stellar. I found it interesting when Butler insulted the judge and showed her the shortcomings of the US legal system which in my opinion is one of the strongest scenes in the film. When he wreaks havoc (as he said himself in the movie in the biblical sense of the word) noboddy can blame him for doing something wrong and I found myself cheering when one of the hypocrites bit the dust. Still there is some small criticism I have to place here: The ending sucked. I don't want to spoil it here, but see for yourself.
