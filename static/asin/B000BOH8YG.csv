I was too young to appreciate this show (but not its theme music) when it first appeared on T.V. and to watch it all from a fresh perspective today was a real buzz. There's great writing and great characters, such as the resilient Capt Furillo and the ""take no prisoners"" Howard Hunter.If you're looking for a gritty urban cop drama with generous amounts of humour and some location shots then season one of HSB is highly recommended. I'm quite sure fans of shows such as Barney Miller and M*A*S*H, which are comedies first with some great drama, will be well rewarded by viewing HSB.At the moment I'm reliving season one of NYPD Blue on DVD; another gritty cop drama from Steven Bochco, although this one contains some dizzy camera work and more than its fair share of mandatory butt shots. Once I'm done with this, I'll definitely have to purchase season two of HSB.",5,Hill Street is a real buzz!,1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2008,953,"[""'ve"", 'just', 'spent', 'last', 'two', 'weeks', 'so', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'loved', 'minute', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'appreciate', 'show', 'not', 'theme', 'music', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'T.V', 'watch', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'today', 'was', 'real', 'buzz', 'great', 'writing', 'great', 'characters', 'such', 'resilient', 'Capt', 'Furillo', 'take', 'prisoners', 'Howard', 'Hunter.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'gritty', 'urban', 'cop', 'drama', 'generous', 'amounts', 'humour', 'location', 'shots', 'then', 'season', 'one', 'HSB', 'highly', 'recommended', ""'m"", 'quite', 'sure', 'fans', 'shows', 'such', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'M*A*S*H', 'are', 'comedies', 'first', 'great', 'drama', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'rewarded', 'viewing', 'HSB.At', 'moment', ""'m"", 'reliving', 'season', 'one', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'DVD', 'gritty', 'cop', 'drama', 'Steven', 'Bochco', 'one', 'dizzy', 'camera', 'work', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'mandatory', 'butt', 'shots', ""'m"", 'done', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'have', 'purchase', 'season', 'two', 'HSB']",Hill Street Blues - Season 1

I actually didn't start watching Hill Street Blues until midway through season 2, so other than catching a couple of the episodes from Season 1 in reruns these shows were mostly new to me. Writers Steven Bochco and Michael Kozoll created some of the most original characters ever seen on TV up to that point. Although the show was never a ratings smash it achieved cult status with its extremely loyal fan base and earned 98 Emmy Award Nominations during its seven year run.The Season One set has all 17 episodes, including the award-winning pilot ""Hill Street Station"". It is interesting to note, three actors who became major characters in the show, Michael Warren (Hill), Charles Haid (Renko), and Ed Marinaro (Coffey) were all originally scripted to be killed during this season. Hill & Renko in the pilot, and Coffey in episode 17. In fact, Coffey WAS killed in the original airing of the show but was such a hit that the producers decided to remake the final scene for reruns, referring to him as wounded.Also included is an hour-long reunion show with many of the stars, including Michael Warren, Charles Haid, Barbara Bosson, Veronica Hamel, and Bruce Weitz. It's a blast watching them reminisce about the show and how much they enjoyed it.I would highly recommend this to fans of television police shows.

946772,A2VMT89TCSF105,B000BOH8YG,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[0, 0]","""Hill Street Blues"" (HSB) was a successful American TV series during the 1980's. It seems only three seasons have been released on DVD. This is the first one. The series is set in an anonymous American city, where a group of police officers fight a never ending battle with street gangs, common criminals and corruption in their own ranks. Above all, they fight with themselves and their personal problems. Characters include police chief Frank Furillo, his rival and lover Joyce Davenport, officers Goldblume, Renko and Washington, and the undercover agent Belker. The series became an international success, but seems to be almost forgotten today.HSB was aired on Swedish television during my high school years. I only remember bits and pieces of it, mostly the weird parts (remember the transvestite who becomes a judge?). Most of all, I remember the reactions of other people to the series.My grandmother considered it a comic show, and laughed at all episodes, including the serious ones. She even called the series ""The Comedy"". My father nicknamed Goldblume ""Daniel Ortega"" after the then-president of Nicaragua. I mean, the similarity is striking. My buddies at school loved and often imitated Belker, and there was even a kind of hat known as ""the Belker hat"". And, of course, many people have used the expression ""Hey, hey, let's be careful out there"", used by one of the characters in the show.Personally, I hated HSB until I took a clue from my grandma, learning to watch it as a comedy. Indeed, it *does* contain a lot of funny situations and twists: the tough and perfect Frank Furillo turns out to be member of the AA, Belker goes undercover as a chicken, Captain Freedom does a parody of Rambo, and the gang leader Jesus Martinez becomes a lawyer. Did I mention the transvestite judge? There are also characters that are involuntarily comic, such as the SWAT commander Hunter (who reminds me of Donald Duck). Overall, however, I think HSB is pretty depressive and claustrophobic. You do get the feeling that crime, corruption and personal problems will never cease. Don't watch this if you're into positive thinking!Once again, this DVD only contains the first season. Many of the situations I described above are probably from later seasons. I just couldn't help myself reviewing the whole series. It's very difficult to rate ""Hill Street Blues"", but for old times sake, I'll give it five stars...And hey, let's be careful out there! ;-)",5,Let's be careful out there,1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,2454,"['Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'HSB', 'was', 'successful', 'American', 'TV', 'series', '1980', 'only', 'three', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'first', 'one', 'series', 'set', 'anonymous', 'American', 'city', 'where', 'group', 'police', 'officers', 'fight', 'never', 'ending', 'battle', 'street', 'gangs', 'common', 'criminals', 'corruption', 'own', 'ranks', 'fight', 'personal', 'problems', 'Characters', 'include', 'police', 'chief', 'Frank', 'Furillo', 'rival', 'lover', 'Joyce', 'Davenport', 'officers', 'Goldblume', 'Renko', 'Washington', 'undercover', 'agent', 'Belker', 'series', 'became', 'international', 'success', 'be', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'today.HSB', 'was', 'aired', 'Swedish', 'television', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'only', 'remember', 'bits', 'pieces', 'mostly', 'weird', 'parts', 'remember', 'transvestite', 'who', 'judge', 'Most', 'remember', 'reactions', 'other', 'people', 'series.My', 'grandmother', 'considered', 'comic', 'show', 'laughed', 'episodes', 'including', 'serious', 'ones', 'even', 'called', 'series', 'Comedy', 'father', 'nicknamed', 'Goldblume', 'Daniel', 'Ortega', 'then-president', 'Nicaragua', 'mean', 'similarity', 'striking', 'buddies', 'school', 'loved', 'often', 'imitated', 'Belker', 'was', 'even', 'kind', 'hat', 'known', 'Belker', 'hat', 'course', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'used', 'expression', 'Hey', 'hey', 'let', 'be', 'careful', 'there', 'used', 'one', 'characters', 'show.Personally', 'hated', 'HSB', 'took', 'clue', 'grandma', 'learning', 'watch', 'comedy', 'Indeed', 'contain', 'lot', 'funny', 'situations', 'twists', 'tough', 'perfect', 'Frank', 'Furillo', 'out', 'be', 'member', 'AA', 'Belker', 'undercover', 'chicken', 'Captain', 'Freedom', 'parody', 'Rambo', 'gang', 'leader', 'Jesus', 'Martinez', 'lawyer', 'Did', 'mention', 'transvestite', 'judge', 'are', 'also', 'characters', 'are', 'involuntarily', 'comic', 'such', 'SWAT', 'commander', 'Hunter', 'who', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'Overall', 'however', 'think', 'HSB', 'pretty', 'depressive', 'claustrophobic', 'do', 'get', 'feeling', 'crime', 'corruption', 'personal', 'problems', 'will', 'never', 'cease', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'re"", 'positive', 'thinking', 'Once', 'again', 'DVD', 'only', 'first', 'season', 'Many', 'situations', 'described', 'are', 'probably', 'later', 'seasons', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'myself', 'reviewing', 'whole', 'series', 'very', 'difficult', 'rate', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'old', 'times', 'sake', ""'ll"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'hey', 'let', 'be', 'careful', 'there']",Hill Street Blues - Season 1

946776,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000BOH8YG,calvinnme,"[6, 8]","I was lucky enough to be able to follow this show from the beginning, and it was truly unlike any police show that had been on TV up to that point. When Hill Street premiered in January 1981, cable had just begun to become available to most homes, and so most cop shows up to that point had been network fare looking for mass appeal that were either overserious ala ""Dragnet"", comical ala ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Car 54"", or just over the top ala ""The Mod Squad"".Hill Street was completely different. It showed the hopeless poverty of those living in the run-down Hill Street precinct, the shaken rape victims immediately after the crime, the ups and downs of the various partnerships among the officers, and the personal lives of the members of the force. The only brave act Hill Street never performed was actually NAMING the city in which the drama was playing out. With all of the snow, the entrenched bureaucracy, and with neighborhoods with names such as ""Midtown"", I can only imagine this must have been New York City, but for some reason producer Bochco never actually named the location.The series was one of the first to regularly employ handheld cameras to give the show a fly-on-the-wall, documentary feel, but this technique was not overused. Also, the show pulled no punches on the personal lives of the characters. During the first season LaRue descends from a somewhat slimy charmer to a completely pickled bum, and Hill and Renko's doubts and fears after being gunned down help to humanize roles that up to that time had often been wrapped up in macho posturing.One of the lighter sides of season one is forty-something Phil Esterhaus trying to decide between his eighteen year old girlfriend Cindy and the fortiesh and erotic Grace Gardner who is trying to make up for lost time at a pace that would probably even seem extreme to Hugh Hefner. Another funny moment is when Esterhaus ends roll call by saying that he has been ordered to inspect the officers for ""unusual weapons."" The cops bring out hunting knives, switchblades, and sawed-off shotguns, throwing them on a table. As Esterhaus continues his announcements, the officers return their brass knuckles and other contraband weapons to their pockets. Comedy sometimes turns to tragedy, though, such as when Belker keeps apprehending a fellow who thinks he is a comic book crimefighter and when asked for his name keeps giving his comic book name. Eventually, though, the caped crimefighter runs across a criminal who doesn't get the joke and he is killed.The one aspect of Hill Street that never really made sense to me was the couple of Frank Furillo and Joyce Davenport. With Frank overseeing the police officers that tend to the mayhem that is the world of crime-ridden Hill Street, and Joyce as public defender doing her best to free every criminal no matter how guilty, I can't imagine why they would ever want to have anything to do with one another socially, assuming they truly believed in what they were doing on the job.As a final point, if you haven't seen this show since it first aired 25 years ago, you're going to notice a lot of not-yet stars that were playing guest spots during this first season. These include David Caruso who later starred on Bochco's NYPD Blue, Tim Daly of ""Wings"", Michael Tucker of Bochco's ""L.A. Law"", and a young Danny Glover as a very scary gang member.

I was in the Air Force then and remember this show being one of the absolute best on television. To those who are quick to forget, Hill Street Blues set the precedent for cop shows to come. By killing off key characters occasionally the show had a sense of stark, gritty realism that made most of the cop shows of it's time seem like 'Car 54'. This show was in the forefront of bold, daring originality. True, when Michael Conrad died there WAS a decline in the show because he was such a well-loved character, but the show retained it's greatness nonetheless.

946779,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000BOH8YG,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[5, 32]","I started watching this season immediately after finishing the outstanding newest season of ""The Shield,"" so the bar was set unusually high for this series, so I really don't hold it against the first season of ""Hill Street Blues"" for walking right into it. It quite frankly seemed to be moving in slow motion compared to ""The Shield.""  And for all the complaints we have to listen to about us being an ADD culture, that show is better off for it's reluctance to spend time with the mundane. But more important than the speed is the intelligence. ""Hill Street Blues"" tell you what to think about right and wrong. Their theme music screams ""We're the good guys!"" and from then on that statement is never so much as looked at, much less challenged. ""The Shield"" challenges you to figure out who the good guys are, and why.Despite all that ""Hill Street Blues"" puts out a decent effort in its first season. We follow Captain Frank Furillo and his quirky, flawed staff of cops around an unnamed city. They come up against gangs, corrupt cops, and neglectful mothers. They even try to open a saloondramat (a what?). The main problem is I simply cannot go back in time and watch this show in its original time slot. Remember, back in 1981 we were emerging from a decade that saw ""Starsky and Hutch"" as the typical TV cop show. Still, the amount of violence and sexuality I found was, while tame by today's standards, more than I expected. I was also quite pleased with the character development of Furillo. He truly is a case study in healthy management skills. He's tough when need be, but accomplishes most of his tasks through logic and understanding. His character is beautiful counterpoint to the megalomaniac, tough for the sake of looking tough Glen Haskins from ""Glory Road."" The season finale delivered some surprises, as season finales typically do. One you can see coming from a country mile away, the other hits you like a cold slap to the face . . . well, make that a warm slap. A major complaint I would have is the shows habit of leaving plot threads hanging. One that leaps to mind involves Phil leaving his wife to marry an 18 year old because of her fertility (hey man, whatever he says). Despite the fact that said marriage ends in disaster, his love life is never mentioned again. Does he get back together with his wife? And I really don't give two toots what the writers of this show think, his wife cannot compete, looks wise, with an 18 year old. Any 18 year old. Period.So do I recommend this season? Yes, but barely. It should really only be viewed as supplementary to modern shows like ""24,"" ""The Wire,"" and of course ""The Shield."" This show is more of a relic. A quaint piece of TV history where police corruption is treated as the exception not the rule, and morals matter more than politics. I'm sure back in 1981 the show would've looked awesome, but time has not been kind. But I still respect it because now it has been reincarnated into some of the best shows on TV.

Hill Street Blues survived and ran for seven seasons because a TV Executive liked it and needed a one-hour show to fill his schedule and ran with it despite rock bottom ratings. Ground-breaking in the portrayal of real-life human beings who happened to be cops rather than bodies who wore uniforms, performed chase scenes and caught bad guys. The show has a large ensemble cast all of whom are fully developed characters. They have lives outside their work as police officers and they perform their duties despite their weaknesses and conflicts on and off the job. The people they deal with live in a disadvantaged neighbourhood and are not portrayed in black and white terms but as human beings faced with difficult circumstances who make bad choices. The actors were given latitude to improvise beyond the lines they were given and the opportunity to influence the arc of their character's storyline to fit their own personalities. The degree to which this show influenced the way later shows were written, shot, and edited for TV cannot be over-stated.Alas only 2 seasons of the show have come to DVD to date but after marathon sessions glued to the show I discovered the fifty-minute retrospective on the back of disk 3 which shows surviving members of the cast decades later fondly discussing the show and the characters they portrayed intercut with snippets of the scenes they describe which among other things refreshes our memory so that we can match the mature individuals with the youthful actors on screen. This is a show that demands that its viewers pay attention and digest what they are watching. It is not like so many summer blockbusters that show endless actions sequences strung together by a weak plot; here the violence hits home because we get to see how it affects the people involved.

You could get Beverly Hillbillys, Petticoat Junction, Space 1999, and God knows what other awful television shows now for years, but not this, perhaps the most groundbreaking dramatic series of the past twenty years.  Sure, compared to The Sopranos, The Shield, Deadwood, and earlier, Homicide, and of course, NYPD Blue, this is pretty tame stuff. But put in the context of its time, and given that without it, the shows mentioned above wouldn't exist, the fact that Hill Street Blues may come across as a little dated does not alter one iota its brilliance.  I still remember watching the first episode, the pilot, and my jaw dropping open in the opening, soon to become regular, moment of the show, the roll call, when Sgt. Esterhaus (the great Michael Conrad) asks the assembled morning shift to dispose of unauthorized weapons. And out come an assemblage of guns, knives, brass knuckles, etc., to make any law-and-order believing cop lover cringe.  Two minutes into the series and you knew you weren't in the world of any cop show you'd ever seen before.  You knew you were about to see realism, at least in the television sense of it, taken to places you'd never known. The multi-plots, the gritty documentary visual style, the overlapping dialogue ala Robert Altman, the diverse cast, the characters who were defined by the imperfections, the view of law enforcement as an imperfect system driven by forces like politics, the relationship between the primarily white police and the mostly black and brown people it served, all was fresh and new and startling.  Few network shows, then and now, dared to take the chances this show did.  It's about time that we get to revisit the Hill Street Precinct again and its wonderfully quirky cast of beleaguered cops and their infinitely complicated, alterantivey funny and tragic lives.

That's too bad since the 3rd and 4th seasons with Dennis Franz joining the cast as Lt. Buntz were really good as well.

There are very few shows that can establish a direct relationship with the viewer which makes them want to watch the whole season in one sitting, but this show does this without blinking.  All in all, I cannot commend this show enough for its originality, and remember, I am an unfortunate soul who has only been privileged to watch two seasons on dvd (which begins the problem).The problem I see is threefold.  First, why can't anyone in Hollywood come up with a long-lasting and unique idea that can create the fanbase that Hill Street Blues had?  Where have the writers gone?  Are we as people going to be treated with garbage reality shows and misfit sitcoms for the remainder of our lives?  Second, what is the hold up with the rest of the releases?  As many reviewers have already stated, there are countless (and marketless) TV-DVD releases every week, so why can't Hill Street Blues be one of the series' that people will actually buy?  And finally, as such a fantastic show, shouldn't it get a little better DVD treatment?  I know this is a minor gripe, but I am not a fan of double-sided discs.  I've actually had trouble with both seasons skipping and becoming pixelated to the point that I had to skip over certain episode chapters.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this issue, but I would definitely like to see future releases (Please!) on one-sided discs.I've now watched both seasons in their entirety three times, the latest being with my girlfriend, born in 1985, who finished them in a matter of weeks.

NYPD Blue, the Law & Order franchise, etc. are all because of this show.  HSB set the bar high showing the trials and tribulations of the beat cops, detectives and their shift supervisor Capt. Furillo at the Hill Street Precinct in the big city (production crew went to great lengths to not specify a city).  This isn't CHiPs, or Starsky & Hutch either.HSB is a bit gritty, and the pilot episode is a realistic reflection of law enforcement compared to many other shows that just show the detective with classic good looks getting the bad guys and (possibly) the girl.  The show gets right into the thick of things quick.  HSB focuses on the daily problems and conflicts of beat cops and the residents of the precinct that they protect and serve.  Along with drama, you do get some comic relief with the characters and events around the station, but not too much to cheapen the entire act with an absurd act or two.I'm only 22, so I didn't see Hill Street when it was brand spankin' new.  I saw a few bits on youtube after my parents told me about the show.  After one free iTunes episode download, I had to have the whole season.

Rewatching the first season of this show reminded me that even two decades later, this remains a quality show.Prior to Hill Street Blues, cop shows tended to focus almost entirely on the mystery of the week.  Characters rarely changed from week to week, so you could watch the episodes in almost any order.  The personal lives of the characters was completely secondary, often just enough to give them a bit of dimension.  Hill Street Blues changed that.Unlike most cop shows, Hill Street Blues really was an ensemble show, taking place in the Hill Street Precinct of an unnamed but generally run-down city.  The central character is Captain Frank Furillo, who is as much a bureaucrat as a cop; while generally a good guy, he knows when rules need to be bent or broken, but there are certain lines he won't cross.  There are street cops, most notably Officers Hill and Renko who bicker like a married couple and detectives like LaRue and Washington, the former being an alcoholic who is always on the brink of self-destruction.  A favorite of many is Mick Belker, a grungy diminutive detective whose bite is as bad as his bark, yet he always has time to talk to his mother.Some cop characters start off as stereotypes, but eventually develop some depth. Howard Hunter starts off as the semi-fascist leader of the EAT (essentially a SWAT team) and Henry Goldblume is Hunter's bleeding-heart liberal contrast.  Goldblume evolves in this season, but Hunter will take several seasons to really seem human.It is amazing that in this era when story arcs can often takes many episodes if not entire seasons, that there was concern when certain Hill Street Blues stories took three or four episodes to resolve; could the audience handle it?  Apparently so.  In fact, though some parts of this show are dated (the first season is 28 years old, after all), overall Hill Street Blues holds up well.  With both humor and gravity, this is an excellent show.  If you enjoy today's crime dramas (CSI, Numbers, Cold Case, etc.), check out the show that really kicked off the modern version of the genre.",5,The best show of its era,1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,2354,"['was', 'time', '1980s', 'when', 'best', 'hour', 'television', 'was', 'Thursdays', '10:00', 'when', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'came', 'time', 'was', 'dedicated', 'fan', ""'d"", 'caught', 'show', 'occasionally', 'syndication', ""'d"", 'been', 'years', ""'d"", 'really', 'seen', 'show', 'Rewatching', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'reminded', 'even', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'quality', 'show.Prior', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'cop', 'shows', 'tended', 'focus', 'almost', 'entirely', 'mystery', 'week', 'Characters', 'rarely', 'changed', 'week', 'week', 'could', 'watch', 'episodes', 'almost', 'order', 'personal', 'lives', 'characters', 'was', 'completely', 'secondary', 'often', 'just', 'enough', 'give', 'bit', 'dimension', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'changed', 'most', 'cop', 'shows', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'really', 'was', 'ensemble', 'show', 'taking', 'place', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Precinct', 'unnamed', 'generally', 'run-down', 'city', 'central', 'character', 'Captain', 'Frank', 'Furillo', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'bureaucrat', 'cop', 'generally', 'good', 'guy', 'when', 'rules', 'need', 'be', 'bent', 'broken', 'are', 'certain', 'lines', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cross', 'are', 'street', 'cops', 'most', 'notably', 'Officers', 'Hill', 'Renko', 'who', 'bicker', 'married', 'couple', 'detectives', 'LaRue', 'Washington', 'former', 'being', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'always', 'brink', 'self-destruction', 'favorite', 'many', 'Mick', 'Belker', 'grungy', 'diminutive', 'detective', 'bite', 'as', 'bad', 'bark', 'yet', 'always', 'time', 'talk', 'mother.Some', 'cop', 'characters', 'start', 'off', 'stereotypes', 'eventually', 'develop', 'depth', 'Howard', 'Hunter', 'semi-fascist', 'leader', 'EAT', 'essentially', 'SWAT', 'team', 'Henry', 'Goldblume', 'Hunter', 'bleeding-heart', 'liberal', 'contrast', 'Goldblume', 'season', 'Hunter', 'will', 'take', 'several', 'seasons', 'really', 'seem', 'human.It', 'amazing', 'era', 'when', 'story', 'arcs', 'can', 'often', 'many', 'episodes', 'not', 'entire', 'seasons', 'was', 'concern', 'when', 'certain', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'stories', 'took', 'three', 'four', 'episodes', 'resolve', 'could', 'audience', 'handle', 'Apparently', 'so', 'fact', 'parts', 'show', 'are', 'dated', 'first', 'season', '28', 'years', 'old', 'overall', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'up', 'well', 'humor', 'gravity', 'excellent', 'show', 'enjoy', 'today', 'crime', 'dramas', 'CSI', 'Numbers', 'Cold', 'Case', 'etc', 'check', 'show', 'really', 'kicked', 'off', 'modern', 'version', 'genre']",Hill Street Blues - Season 1

946810,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B000BOH8YG,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[0, 0]","I don't know if I ever watched a complete episode of Hill Street Blues when it was on TV back in the day, and if I did I don't remember. I picked up HSB Season 1 at Walmart for $10. Really how can you go wrong spending only ten bucks for a complete series of a tv show? I was initially disappointed in the double sided discs but other than a few slow down frames in just one episode the discs played just fine. I find it a bit annoying to read how some can't find the ""missing episodes"" which are merely on the flip side of the DVD. I guess those people must be new to double sided DVDS.As for the TV show I basically enjoyed the series. At first though I thought the show was pretty dumb. The Bruce Weitz/Det. Belker character was a bit on the stoooopid side at first. Later on though the character seemed to move on from a cliched character to a more believable one. I think the characters of Frank Furillo and Joyce Davenport though got to be the most tedious to me. I grew tired of their being above the fray, of their being smarter and less emotional than everyone else. Their relationship was one long BORE to this viewer. I admit that Veronica Hamel/Davenport was one fine looking woman back in the day but her character made her seem to be such a---- starts with a B and ends with an H. So for all that Super Fox was worth I preferred the more approachable characters. This is not to say I enjoyed Betty Thomas as Lucille Bates instead of Veronica Hamel. I appreciated Lucille Bates' feelings of insecurity due to her six foot one inch stature. She is a big woman, even in real life. It's not like Betty Thomas could be a small woman in real life. So one has to think that Thomas was able to pull from some real life insecurity and pain.I guess the show for me was the partnerships of Renko and Hill and Washington and Larue. Watching those four characters made me think of Starsky and Hutch. However I have to say that the Renko character was simply weird and the character came off as some sort of gay man, in my opinion of course. I just found his mannerisms to be effeminate, not that there aren't people like that. Hill was rock solid though as a character, as he was supposed to be also. Detective Larue really stole the show at the end of Season 1, and how sad to know that the man also suffered in real life as an alcoholic. And then Larue/Kiel Martin would die young in real life of lung cancer. I think the man had cancer. And finally the other character who was much beloved was the Phil Esterhaus/Michael Conrad character. All through season one though I felt his character was also much of a cliche, as Esterhaus spoke out his carefully crafted roll call speeches. Truly Esterhaus was supposed to be the wise old police Sgt. I also didn't care for his inappropriate relationship with a high school senior girl. Really, there is enough of that B.S. in real life without the show seemingly giving it a moral pass. I was glad when Esterhaus left the girl at the alter. The relationship with Grace was more entertaining, even though I didn't care for the Grace character. I just don't enjoy that actress. She seems so pretentious and fake. And it was also sad to read how Michael Conrad/Esterhaus would die in 1984. He seemed to be a kind soul. Of course he might have been a mean jackass in real life but how would I know. Also, I enjoyed seeing a very young Mimi Rodgers in season 1 as Mrs Pauley. Also, what a trip it was to recognize David Caruso as an Irish Gang Member. Wow, he looked like a cartoon character.In closing, I couldn't believe how old this show was when I looked it up on Amazon.com. 1981 is the year I graduated from high school so this TV show dates me as well. The police cars look so OLD now. I also wondered where this city was. Where was Hill Street? I decided the community of Hill Street must be near Washington DC since the president of the US was going to visit the area, but then that never happened. In closing though I watched this series in about two to three days. It was fairly easy to watch. I think a lot of the series is dated and every episode bored me to some extent. Also, before I forget I didn't really care for the character of Lt Calletano. He just didn't do anything for me. And he died the same year that Kiel Martin died of lung cancer.All in all this is decent TV entertainment for the price. I hope the rest of the show comes out on DVD because I don't buy Instant Video stuff that Amazon sells. I like to own copies of what I watch so I can watch it again sometime. I don't even know how the Amazon stuff works.",4,Started out corny and cliched but got better over time.,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,4580,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ever', 'watched', 'complete',

Frank Furillo was the captain of the Hill Street Station, and any company wanting to train staff in leadership skills etc should include episodes of Hill Street Blues as compulsory viewing. Furillo was a wonderful leader and human being.Next was Michael Conrad who played Sgt Phil Esterhaus who left the series in Series three (I think) when the actor was too ill (cancer) to work any longer. His parting warning to his team ""Now let's be careful out there,"" was always the last thing he said to those heading out on patrol at the beginning of every episode.Was there anyone in Television more stunning than Veronica Hamel ? On screen she was simply mesmorising.Another item of note about Hill Street - how much class the African American officers displayed, and what wonderful roles were written for them.  Officer Bobby Hill (Michael Warren) who had to deal with his partner, the complaining Renko (Charles Haid) and teach him to grow up, whilst Det Washington (Taurean Blaque) had the lyin' La Rue alias John JD LaRue (Kiel Martin) to constantly cover for, as his partner womanized and drank to excess, and went awol from jobs.Other characters/actors of note in this series were James B Sikking as Lt Howard Hunter, the military misfit, and Joe Spano as the gentle Henry Goldblume the real right hand man to Furillo.I love this series as much today as I did back then and agree with those many on here who say the quality of the transfer to DVD and general packaging could have been a lot better.However, after waiting so long for the series to appear on DVD we will just have to put up with what we're given.Question : How long before Series Three ?

However, I bought it for a friend, a big fan of the show who, after watching the entire season, sent it back to me to watch for myself.  While the hair and clothing styles are a bit dated, the story lines and show itself hold up even today.  Though the SD discs are two sided and the audio is in mono, the quality of the video itself was pretty darn good for such an old series.  I felt like the blacks were a bit too crushed eliminating much detail but other than that, and especially if you are or were a fan, the series and DVD holds up. There's no question that this series spurned the development of the fantastic NYPD Blues and is the godfather of many similar shows.

946818,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B000BOH8YG,susannah,"[0, 0]","I loved this show when it was first on and have seen Season 1 and now watching Season 2 again. It still is amazing and tough and gritty and truly groundbreaking for its time. The characters were for the most part real, developed characters who were shown to be the flawed, human people they were, who loved and hated their jobs, their lives, each other, themselves.I just love Frank Furillo. He was a good man who had the weight of the world on his shoulders, and I am surprised he was able to function in any way with that weight, dealing with bureaucracy, politics, trying to maintain his force of completely different personalities, with their flaws and weaknesses, an ex wife who exhibited the behavior of a psychotic three year old, who stood in the middle of the squad room and screamed how much she hated him, and of course the never ending criminal activity, sometimes also by members of his own squad, as well as trying to be a good father, and also maintain his relationship with Joyce, with having his 24/7 job. I hated the scenes with Faye, who refused to grow up and take responsibility for anything, but only was a shrieking harpy. It got wearying with Joyce complaining about his hours too. His job was what it was, he was the chief of police, and his day was never over. It seems as though the people around him should have become accustomed to that.The gang summits also just make me furious, these soulless people who break all laws like they take breath,including murder, sitting in the police station discussing what they will or won't do, and feeling completely untouchable by the enforcers of the law. The scenes in Season 1 where the officers thought the station house was under attack by the gangs was truly chilling, as they knew they were outnumbered, outgunned and by, as I said, soulless, cretinous monsters. Their fear was palpable.I tired also of the black = victim, white = evil mentality that was present in every single scene of racial disagreement, scuffle, crime. No one will ever succeed if they don't take responsibility for their own actions and choices, including criminal behavior, and eternally blaming other people for them is codswallop.There were definite flaws to the show, aspects that seem mindboggling now that anyone would think they were acceptable or funny. One was the character of Esterhaus, a seemingly kindly, gentle older man, who seemed to be some sort of sexual addict, and for the whole first season was sexually involved with and even nearly married a high school girl. He would talk about her being in the marching band, maintaining good grades and talking about her prom dress as though he was a father, and then speak of their sexual relationship. What about this doesn't scream pedophile, and every kind of inappropriate, if not criminal?Renko, also not a young man, in later seasons also was having a relationship with Daryl Ann, I remember, who was also in her teens.The first season had a show in which a mother is threatening her daughter with a knife. Hill and Renko investigate to find a woman threatening to kill the girl, who looked about 12, because her husband, the girl's stepfather, was having sex with the girl. The man confessed, saying the girl wore skimpy clothes and the woman didn't ""give him enough."" Hill ""handled"" everything by telling the girl to stop doing that, and the woman to ""pay more attention"" to her husband. No one was arrested, nor was there even any mention of crimes committed, more just a domestic squabble.Joe, Lucy's partner, spent his time trying to ""protect"" Lucy from dangerous situations, telling her to take cover, because he ""had it bad"" for her and wanted to have sex with her. Every conversation between them had to do with how he was going to have his way with her. I am sorry that Betty Thomas felt that she just had to take the constant harassment and diminishment of her character as a skilled law officer. It's not a compliment to be seen only as a object for sex, not a real, professional human being.I thought Howard and LaRue were detriments to the police force. LaRue was just a drunk, weak screwup, but Howard was downright scary. Belker rocks! I think the portrayal of his character was actually the most interesting and nuanced, since he wasn't only the growling, scruffy, hardass he looked like, and often showed other emotional layers, more so than the others at times. Hunter was a one note mercenary, Frank was too ""good,"" and never let Faye have it, which he really really should have, etc. But speaking of letting other emotional layers show, the scenes between Hill and Renko after their Season 1 shooting, were gripping and very real.There were definite flaws starting out, but this was such a good show, and the depth of talent really impressive. I so wish the seasons after 2 were also available.",4,Excellent show,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,4828,"['loved', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'have', 'seen', 'Season', '1', 'now', 'watching',
