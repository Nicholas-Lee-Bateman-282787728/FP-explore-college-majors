With humor that primarily surround the ordeal the 3 men have to contend with, 3 MEN AND A BABY relies on the chemistry the 3 main stars generate with  each other. At first they experience dismay with the infant; I mean, how can three unmarried men take care of a baby?! But soon enough the 3 guys fall in love with her. But with good measure, a drug- smuggling subplot is thrown in (probably to make it not look like your a typical family-oriented comedy). Nevertheless, Danson, Selleck, and Guttenberg shine.

The girlfriend of one of them gives birth, and suddenly abandons the baby with the father. He soon takes off, leaving the two remaining men to take care of the baby.What a disaster! The men have a strong case of learned helplessness. They have no clue as to what to do. They cannot fasten a diaper properly. They have no idea how to use baby oil and baby powder. At one point, they use a turkey baster to rinse the skin of the soiled baby girl. When they finally attach the diaper, it turns out to be too big, and it slides right off. The feeding schedules and the infant cries completely mess up the schedules and sleeping times of the men. They soon are so exhausted that they cannot function properly at work.One woman acquaintance who is asked to help tells the men that she has no innate skills in dealing with an infant just because she is a woman. The mother of the father of the baby girl also refuses to help, pointing out that her adult son must finally learn some responsibility for his actions. Other complications develop. Someone mistakenly ships a package of heroin to the apartment, and a narcotics cop comes and performs a search.In time, the father of the infant returns, and, after getting a lot of flak for taking off, he joins the other two men in become strongly attached to the baby girl. Then there are fireworks: A drug-dealing action overtakes the three hapless, innocent men, and the mother shows up to claim her baby...The ending is anticlimactic.The acting is good.
