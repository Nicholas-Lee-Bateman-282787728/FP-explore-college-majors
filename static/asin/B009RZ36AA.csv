1601638,A76YYKY2IKTH4,B009RZ36AA,A. Hutto,"[1, 4]","i wrote a review to part 1....this is part 2. the visual and audio quality is about on par with part 1. so really if youve seen part 1 you know what your getting that said this is the grand finale. and to be blunt it fails.the grand finale as i pointed out in part 1 is full of illogical plotholes, terrible writing, weird decisions and overall just being rushed.to spoil the bad ending...we have naruku(spelling?) suddenly decide he needed to use only some of the power of the completely jewel to turn into a giant spider which is fine. the flaw in this logic is sessoshomaru has a new sword that he got in part 1 by having his arm magically regrow and have a sword pop out with it at the same time. this new sword when it hits something it spreads the damage until it kills whatever it has hit...this is so insanely cheap even in the universe of inuyasha it is a bit mind boggling....naraku is fully aware of this...and still decides to go herp derp and transform into a giant target to which this new sword hits once(well several times really) and proceeds to splash damage bleed him to death. the biggest insult here is naruku has NO ANSWER TO THIS. not even a vague back up plan and barely puts up a fight. the all mighty all cunning naruku just simply stops fighting for literally no reason at all. its just a terrible finale its mind boggling. in fact if i recall its kagome that talks him out of fighting yes thats right kagome while he is still getting splash damaged to death....he tries to stop it by severing part of his body but he just gets hit with the sword again its almost comical how bad this is. band not once does he even use the completely defiled jewel shard in all its infinite power.its like he walks into that fight and powers up and armors up and transforms and everything and then does nothing...it'd be akin to goku going SSJ4 then just standing their while omega shenron proceeded to beat the tar out of him. which is what happens here naruku gets beaten badly and does nothing to stop it. nothing. completely out of character. not escape plan not cunning trap. nothing.then after he dies inuyasha and kagome go into the world of the jewel(the jewel itself where the grand plan was to have kagome and naruku be the new souls eternally fighting in the jewel...inuyasha chases after her and saves her...the jewel is then gotten rid how you ask? because kagome wishes the jewel away and the jewel does it no questions asked despite being the apparent mastermind behind this all. the jewel just goes with the flow despite making a clear effort to stay alive. yep high quality cop out writing.then inuyasha takes kagome back to her home world and is suddenly warped back to the feudal era....then strangely and in one of the shows biggest mind boggling plot points that it never lets die and that point being kagomes insistence on how important high school and junior high are to her future of slaying demons...she magically is able to return to the feudal era and live happily ever after only after finishing high school in fact on the exact day she graduates the well magically works because i guess calculus must be so important to demon slaying eh? or living in the feudal era for the rest of her life which in another variation from her character she doesnt eve get weepy or crying at the thought of leaving her family forever. and inuyasha still has those stupid beads around his neck youd think he'd have earned the right to have that removed. but nope.and there we have it folks 8 seasons and the show is finally done....this is an example of how NOT to end a show. the shows ending is the weakest part of the entire show. the final act should be viewed as how not to end a series. its not as bad as the dbz ending but its pretty bad but even then we get GT to give it a proper farewell(the only thing GT does right really). in the history of TV there are bad endings but then there are endings like dbz and inuyasha the final act which take bad ending to a whole new level. in fact its almost better off to simply stop watching at season 7 and pretend it ends there as that bad ending beats the heck out of this ending.the visuals and audio are on par with part 1 and it is presented rather well. the complaints are mostly at the terrible story.buy this because you have the other 7 seasons and must own all 8 or because you havent seen it but dont buy it expecting a good ending.",2,and the terrible grand finale...,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,4414,"['i', 'wrote', 'review', 'part', '1', '.this', 'part', '2.',

Miroku doesn't have much time left, and the jewel is almost entirely in Naraku's hands. Inuyasha's group will have to team up with Sesshomaru if they hope to defeat the evil demon. When they do, what will happen to the sacred jewel? Will Kagome be able to go between worlds? Or will she have to choose one? Will she even have a choice? All of the questions you may have had for the past 12+ years are going to be answered.This is the end of Inuyasha. It's been a long time coming, but it's finally over. I have to admit that it ended the way I expected, but I was still a little let down. The final battle with Naraku lasted for most of the last 8 episodes or so. Once the battle is over, the series wraps up pretty quickly. Even thought there is a time warp, and 3 years pass immediately, I really wish that we had a few more episodes to look into the future a little more. After such a long and drawn out series, I think it was kind of owed to the fans. Despite those feelings, I'm still happy with the ending.Either way, if you have been a fan of the series all this time, you will probably thoroughly enjoy this conclusion. The animation, soundtrack, and voice acting is all still very good. You may already know that Kagome, and Sesshomaru have new voice actors. I wouldn't worry about it so much.

In these last 13 episodes you'll get more romance, more action and more awesome episodes than the first set contained. Without giving too much from this set away.. there is an ""almost"" kiss scene and 2 actual kiss scenes between two different pairings from the series before the group heads inside of Naraku for the final battle, just to add to the intensity.I received my copy almost 1 month early exactly from RightStuf this week. The same bonuses/extra features are on this set as the first set, so nothing special sadly. I had very high hopes that Viz would include the opening and endings creditless on this set, but I guess that was a little too much to ask for. The set comes with no advertisements this time either, nothing for Neon Alley, etc. The case is the standard recyclable blue case (for Blu-ray release) - Overall there was absolutely nothing redeeming about this box set in terms of bonuses or extra animated features.The dub voice acting was spot on in these last few episodes, too, as it was in the first set but even better and played with more emotion.So, again without giving too much away.. this set is a MUST HAVE for any true InuYasha fan who is looking to complete the anime. I cannot recommend this set to fans anymore, honestly. These last 13 episodes will have you on the edge of your seat. As I was rewatching the series dubbed it took me right back to 2009 and 2010 when the series was airing in Japan, but even MORE so now that my childhood dub voice actors have [for the most part] returned to their roles.RightStuf currently has this set on pre-order for $10 dollars cheaper than Amazon too.
