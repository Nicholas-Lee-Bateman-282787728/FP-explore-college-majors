Pairing up Helen Hayes and Mildred Natwick was an interesting idea.While the pilot with Art Carney...who played their chauffer and protector, Barney...was very good....the 4 follow-up episodes couldn't measure up.  It seemed as if the ladies were constantly going backwards and forwards throughout each trying to find motives for murder.  This was noticeable when I watched the first 2 regular episodes back-to-back. When I started tapping my feet or hitting the pause button to pour a 2nd glass of wine or grab a frozen Milky Way...I knew I was getting bored.  Many of the excellent guest stars couldn't save the stagnant storylines. [MURDER SHE WROTE used several of the same ones much better].Going back to the pilot, I never realized how beautiful Paulette Goddard was.  This turned out to be her final role before her death.

They are elderly, smart, classy, feisty and possessed of a curiosity that gets them constantly into trouble. In particular, they just cannot leave a mystery alone; unable to suppress their powers of observation and deductive reasoning. Should I mention their ability to fib their way out of most situations? You'll have to watch the show to see Gwendolyn say, with a straight face, ""Exterminating is my hobby. I read palms professionally.""We first meet the sisters when Ernesta, casual in her striped pajamas, clutches a letter opener as she intones, ""I'll kill you. If you come any closer, I'll kill you."" She plunges the letter opener into the desktop - at which sits Gwendolyn in her pink peignoir, writing down every word Ernesta says.Ernesta is a famed mystery writer, working on her new book. She continues her narrative, ""Bewilderment replaced his rage and fear. Suddenly, she felt the familiar pity for those faded blue eyes...""Gwendolyn inturrupts, ""I think, Dear, Howard's eyes were brown in the last chapter.""And there, in a nutshell, is their relationship. They work together well, support each other and gently correct each other. They're so close they can finish each others' sentences. Actually, often they don't need to complete the sentence to know what the other is thinking. The dears are dearly loved by their nephew, Police Lieutenant Steven Ostrowski. Given their age, and living alone in the city, he has hired Barney to be their chauffeur and general factotum.Poor Barney. The sisters are always talking him into doing things he knows he oughtn't. In the episode, ""Corpse and Robbers"", the three of them actually end up in the pokey for a short time. The Lieutenant is furious: ""OK Barney. How do you explain this?""Barney: ""Poorly""Lt: ""Your job is what?""Barney: ""Take care of the ladies. See that they don't get into trouble.""Lt: ""Which means?""Barney: ""You gotta put more men on the job.""Ernesta: ""Steven, don't be harsh with Barney.""Gwendolyn: ""It wasn't his fault.""Ernesta: ""We overpowered him.""There is a lot of delightful humor in this series, situational, dialogue, and character interactions, and including slapstick. Helen Hayes (plays Ernesta) and Mildred Natwick (Gwendolyn) are old pros. and their interactions are seamless. Hayes has a smile that could light up a football stadium, and is especially adorable when attempting to look innocent. I remember Natwick from one of my favorite classic movies, ""The Court Jester"", with Danny Kaye. She is Griselda, ""The pellet with the poison's in the flagon with the dragon! The vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true!""Comparing this to other series, this has the silly comedy and characters that remind me of ""Get Smart"". It has the nice plotting and deductive reasoning that remind me of ""Murder She Wrote"". It has the character chemistry and charm that remind me of ""Rockford Files"". Great Guest Stars: Paulette Goddard (her very last screen appearance), Art Carney (plays Barney in the pilot, only), Victor Buono, Geraldine Page, Walter Pidgeon, Steve Allen, Joan Blondell, George Maharis, Alice Cooper(!), Vincent Price, William DeVane and Roddy McDowall.The pilot originally aired on ABC in December 1972. There followed only four 90-minute episodes, which appeared in rotation on NBC's ""Wednesday Mystery Movie"", along with 3 other shows, including ""Banacek"". It is a shame it did not find a wider audience, because Hayes and Natwick are a real treat to watch in action.",5,Thoroughly Enjoyable Mystery Series With a Couple of Old Pros in the Leads!,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,3578,"['Ernesta', 'Gwendolyn', 'Snoop', 'are', 'sisters', 'extraordinaire', 'live', 'together', 'NYC', 'Gwendolyn', 'husband', 'died', 'are', 'elderly', 'smart', 'classy', 'feisty', 'possessed', 'curiosity', 'constantly', 'trouble', 'particular', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'mystery', 'alone', 'unable', 'suppress', 'powers', 'observation', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'Should', 'mention', 'ability', 'fib', 'way', 'most', 'situations', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'show', 'see', 'Gwendolyn', 'say', 'straight', 'face', 'Exterminating', 'hobby', 'read', 'palms', 'professionally', 'first', 'meet', 'sisters', 'when', 'Ernesta', 'casual', 'striped', 'pajamas', 'letter', 'opener', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'come', 'closer', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'letter', 'opener', 'desktop', 'Gwendolyn', 'pink', 'peignoir', 'writing', 'down', 'word', 'Ernesta', 'says.Ernesta', 'famed', 'mystery', 'writer', 'working', 'new', 'book', 'narrative', 'Bewilderment', 'replaced', 'rage', 'fear', 'Suddenly', 'felt', 'familiar', 'pity', 'faded', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Gwendolyn', 'inturrupts', 'think', 'Dear', 'Howard', 'eyes', 'were', 'brown', 'last', 'chapter', 'there', 'nutshell', 'relationship', 'work', 'together', 'well', 'support', 'other', 'gently', 'correct', 'other', ""'re"", 'so', 'close', 'can', 'finish', 'others', 'sentences', 'Actually', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'complete', 'sentence', 'know', 'what', 'other', 'thinking', 'dears', 'are', 'dearly', 'loved', 'nephew', 'Police', 'Lieutenant', 'Steven', 'Ostrowski', 'Given', 'age', 'living', 'alone', 'city', 'hired', 'Barney', 'be', 'chauffeur', 'general', 'factotum.Poor', 'Barney', 'sisters', 'are', 'always', 'talking', 'doing', 'things', 'ought', ""n't"", 'episode', 'Corpse', 'Robbers', 'three', 'actually', 'end', 'up', 'pokey', 'short', 'time', 'Lieutenant', 'furious', 'OK', 'Barney', 'How', 'do', 'explain', 'Barney', 'Poorly', 'Lt', 'job', 'what', 'Barney', 'Take', 'care', 'ladies', 'See', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'trouble', 'Lt', 'Which', 'Barney', 'got', 'ta', 'put', 'more', 'men', 'job', 'Ernesta', 'Steven', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'harsh', 'Barney', 'Gwendolyn', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'Ernesta', 'overpowered', 'lot', 'delightful', 'humor', 'series', 'situational', 'dialogue', 'character', 'interactions', 'including', 'slapstick', 'Helen', 'Hayes', 'plays', 'Ernesta', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'Gwendolyn', 'are', 'old', 'pros', 'interactions', 'are', 'seamless', 'Hayes', 'smile', 'could', 'light', 'up', 'football', 'stadium', 'especially', 'adorable', 'when', 'attempting', 'look', 'innocent', 'remember', 'Natwick', 'one', 'favorite', 'classic', 'movies', 'Court', 'Jester', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'Griselda', 'pellet', 'poison', 'flagon', 'dragon', 'vessel', 'pestle', 'brew', 'true', 'Comparing', 'other', 'series', 'silly', 'comedy', 'characters', 'remind', 'Get', 'Smart', 'nice', 'plotting', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'remind', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'character', 'chemistry', 'charm', 'remind', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'Great', 'Guest', 'Stars', 'Paulette', 'Goddard', 'very', 'last', 'screen', 'appearance', 'Art', 'Carney', 'Barney', 'pilot', 'only', 'Victor', 'Buono', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'George', 'Maharis', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'William', 'DeVane', 'Roddy', 'McDowall.The', 'pilot', 'originally', 'aired', 'ABC', 'December', '1972', 'followed', 'only', 'four', '90-minute', 'episodes', 'appeared', 'rotation', 'NBC', 'Wednesday', 'Mystery', 'Movie', '3', 'other', 'shows', 'including', 'Banacek', 'shame', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'wider', 'audience', 'Hayes', 'Natwick', 'are', 'real', 'treat', 'watch', 'action']",N/A

Growing up I remember the Snoop Sisters all too well.  I almost paid more than the current price for ONE  very grainy DVD copy of a 16mm film Snoop Sister episode, I was outbid in the final seconds and devastated at my loss.  I would routinely check Amazon.com for the Snoop Sisters on DVD because; Amazon tends to get DVD's of TV Shows I love from my youth.  I figure the company creating the Snoop Sister DVD knows this set has limited appeal which is reflected in its higher price.  You know whatever the reason for the higher price for the Snoop Sisters, I'll pay to have the Snoop Sisters on DVD because; I so totally loved them growing up.  I loved the Snoop Sisters and their WILD WILD HATS.  I loved their old FORD Lincoln  and the fact they really could not drive yet never had an accident while cause all kinds of roadway havoc.  I am autistic so I used to rename shows according to what I liked most about them.  I used to call the Snoop Sisters, ""My Dear Ladies"" because they were so sweet and nice.  I felt the Snoop Sisters were fun.  As an autistic kid I never had real friends so I would make friends with people on TV.  I used to imagine what it would be like to hang out with the Snoop Sisters as my friends.  The Snoop Sisters were so much fun for me growing up.  Helen Hayes was so sweet I used to cry because; I enjoyed watching her enjoy being herself no matter who she upset and no matter what happened in the world around her.  I enjoyed the Snoop Sisters because; they were old and odd and no one expected them to still be vital enough to solve murders  but they were still awesome.  I always enjoyed stories about STRONG VITAL LADIES and these two old dears were the strongest ladies I remember on TV growing up.  At $31.00 the Snoop Sisters DVD's are still higher in price than expected but I brought my copy of the Snoop Sisters while filled with joy and gusto because; they were friends who were one of the few bright spots from my troubled autistic youth.  These dear ladies the Snoop Sisters I always remembered and wanted on DVD.  This Snoop Sister set was the answer to my prayers and I could give a hoot that the set cost $31.00.  The DVD quality was pretty good.  Sometimes the sound and lip synch were off.  The Snoop Sister DVD picture quality was great for an early 1970's era recording capture.  I love the musical score for the Snoop Sisters.  Sometimes I play the Snoop Sisters intro loop just to hear the Snoop Sister theme music.  Now that I am 53 years old I pray I have grown old, odd and happy like the dear Snoop Sisters.  After all these years it is nice to know the Snoop Sisters STILL ROCK!  I was happy to buy the Snoop Sisters at this price.I have one last DVD set I'd like to see from the 1970's a show called LUCAN about a boy raised till age 10 by Wolves in the wilds of Minnesota.  The Lucan series like the Snoop Sisters was a short lived series on the ABC Network.  The entire Lucan series had just twelve episodes including its movie length pilot.  I'd gladly pay $1000.00 for a great copy of the Lucan episode pilot and its complete eleven one hour episodes.  I love that the Snoop Sisters made it to DVD and it gives me hope that someday I will see Lucan and its twelve episodes released on DVD..  Thanks to Amazon.com I have DVD sets of the most treasured shows from my autistic youth.  For me growing up autistic in the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's TV show characters were the closest things I had to friends.  In my autistic youth, I looked forward to visits with my TV friends each week.  Having the ability to visit my TV friends via DVD now that I am an old successful autistic man is priceless to me.  I must say, Thank You AMAZON.COM for giving me the awesome opportunity to buy the Snoop Sisters and other awesome Old series on DVD's which together comprise the best memories of my otherwise painful autistic youth!",5,THE SNOOP SISTERS TOTALLY ROCK!,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,4053,"['People', 'complain', 'price', 'things', 'will', 'pay', 'gladly', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'DVD', 'are', 'one', 'RARE', 'will', 'pay', 'price', 'IT', 'Growing', 'up', 'remember', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'too', 'well', 'almost', 'paid', 'more', 'current', 'price', 'ONE', 'very', 'grainy', 'DVD', 'copy', '16mm', 'film', 'Snoop', 'Sister', 'episode', 'was', 'outbid', 'final', 'seconds', 'devastated', 'loss', 'would', 'routinely', 'check', 'Amazon.com', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'get', 'DVD', 'TV', 'Shows', 'love', 'youth', 'figure', 'company', 'creating', 'Snoop', 'Sister', 'DVD', 'set', 'limited', 'appeal', 'reflected', 'higher', 'price', 'know', 'reason', 'higher', 'price', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'have', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'DVD', 'so', 'totally', 'loved', 'growing', 'up', 'loved', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'WILD', 'WILD', 'HATS', 'loved', 'old', 'FORD', 'Lincoln', 'fact', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'drive', 'yet', 'never', 'had', 'accident', 'cause', 'kinds', 'roadway', 'havoc', 'am', 'autistic', 'used', 'rename', 'shows', 'according', 'what', 'liked', 'most', 'used', 'call', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'Dear', 'Ladies', 'were', 'so', 'sweet', 'nice', 'felt', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'were', 'fun', 'autistic', 'kid', 'never', 'had', 'real', 'friends', 'would', 'make', 'friends', 'people', 'TV', 'used', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'hang', 'out', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'friends', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'growing', 'up', 'Helen', 'Hayes', 'was', 'so', 'sweet', 'used', 'cry', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'enjoy', 'being', 'matter', 'who', 'upset', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', 'world', 'enjoyed', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'were', 'old', 'odd', 'one', 'expected', 'still', 'be', 'vital', 'enough', 'solve', 'murders', 'were', 'still', 'awesome', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'stories', 'STRONG', 'VITAL', 'LADIES', 'two', 'old', 'dears', 'were', 'strongest', 'ladies', 'remember', 'TV', 'growing', 'up', '31.00', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'DVD', 'are', 'still', 'higher', 'price', 'expected', 'brought', 'copy', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'filled', 'joy', 'gusto', 'were', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'one', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'troubled', 'autistic', 'youth', 'dear', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'always', 'remembered', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'Snoop', 'Sister', 'set', 'was', 'answer', 'prayers', 'could', 'give', 'hoot', 'set', 'cost', '31.00', 'DVD', 'quality', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Sometimes', 'sound', 'lip', 'synch', 'were', 'off', 'Snoop', 'Sister', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'great', 'early', '1970', 'era', 'recording', 'capture', 'love', 'musical', 'score', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'Sometimes', 'play', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'intro', 'loop', 'just', 'hear', 'Snoop', 'Sister', 'theme', 'music', 'Now', 'am', '53', 'years', 'old', 'pray', 'have', 'grown', 'old', 'odd', 'happy', 'dear', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'years', 'nice', 'know', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'STILL', 'ROCK', 'was', 'happy', 'buy', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'price.I', 'have', 'one', 'last', 'DVD', 'set', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', '1970', 'show', 'called', 'LUCAN', 'boy', 'raised', 'till', 'age', '10', 'Wolves', 'wilds', 'Minnesota', 'Lucan', 'series', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'was', 'short', 'lived', 'series', 'ABC', 'Network', 'entire', 'Lucan', 'series', 'had', 'just', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'including', 'movie', 'length', 'pilot', ""'d"", 'gladly', 'pay', '1000.00', 'great', 'copy', 'Lucan', 'episode', 'pilot', 'complete', 'eleven', 'one', 'hour', 'episodes', 'love', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'made', 'DVD', 'hope', 'someday', 'will', 'see', 'Lucan', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'released', 'DVD..', 'Thanks', 'Amazon.com', 'have', 'DVD', 'sets', 'most', 'treasured', 'shows', 'autistic', 'youth', 'growing', 'up', 'autistic', '1960', '1970', '1980', 'TV', 'show', 'characters', 'were', 'closest', 'things', 'had', 'friends', 'autistic', 'youth', 'looked', 'forward', 'visits', 'TV', 'friends', 'week', 'Having', 'ability', 'visit', 'TV', 'friends', 'DVD', 'now', 'am', 'old', 'successful', 'autistic', 'man', 'priceless', 'must', 'say', 'Thank', 'AMAZON.COM', 'giving', 'awesome', 'opportunity', 'buy', 'Snoop', 'Sisters', 'other', 'awesome', 'Old', 'series', 'DVD', 'together', 'comprise', 'best', 'memories', 'otherwise', 'painful', 'autistic', 'youth']",N/A
