679252,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,B00005RHGK,absent_minded_prof,"[0, 0]","In &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; a college-aged brother and sister are driving down a lonely country highway.  Derrin, the brother, has just picked up Trish, the sister, from her college, and is driving home cross country with her.  Suddenly, they are accosted by a terrifyingly loud, terrifyingly fast truck, which seeks to ram them off the road.  Somehow they survive this encounter, but later they see the driver of the truck dumping what looks quite a lot like a dead body into a huge pipe that sticks out of the ground, off by the side of the road, by an abandoned church.  Should they a.)investigate?  or b.) run for their lives?  Personally, I would have chosen &quot;b&quot; in a heartbeat, but hey, it's a horror movie.  They investigate, and their lives immediately take a turn for the worse.  I won't give any more of the story away -- I'll just say that it involves a psychic, some extremely unfortunate cops, a fiendish bad guy, and quite a few horrifying shocks along the way.I predict that this movie will turn out to be an enduring cult classic, like &quot;Phantasm&quot; or &quot;Pumpkinhead.&quot;  It doesn't always make perfect sense, but it feels just enough like the kind of ghost stories kids tell each other over campfires that it has a genuinely mythic, timeless quality.  It seems like it could happen anywhere, in any lonely little small town...  This is the kind of movie guaranteed to provoke nightmares in the little 9-13 year old kid inside all of us.

They soon see the madman's truck and him dumping a body in a pipe. Then these two genuis' decide they want to look down the hole. Soon the Madman is after them.I will admit that the start is pretty good, and what they find in the hole is pretty creepy, but that's done in the first 20 minutes and the rest is pure garbage.  The ending was so incredibly stupid, I actually felt ripped off by the rental price. There is nothing orginal or scary in this movie. What's scary is that the studio actually made this. *shivers*I had real high hopes for this movie. I read a lot of good reviews, people at work told me it was good, and I like horror movies...but this was sooooo bad. I wish I could give it zero stars.

679254,A18BD98SU49UB7,B00005RHGK,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[0, 0]","The first 45 minutes of Jeepers Creepers where pretty good, when all of a sudden the imaginary floor beneath it fell through. One of the biggest problems was the monster, not necessarily it's appearance physically, but it's appearance at all. Movie maker's of films such as ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Relic"" did themselves and the audience a favor by not revealing the villain's appearance too early, that way the viewers imagination would be far worse than anything found in the creature shop. One of the coolest character's on screen comes to mind: Predator. The greatest extent of the case being ""Blair Witch Project"", in which the villain isn't seen at all! Only its effect's. I do like how the creature shows an even nastier side before going out the window. That was fairly creepy!When it's in the shadow's and wearing the ""Raiden"" hat, it appears more hostile.The story is fine. It start's out like Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"", as the kids are chased down an empty highway by a menacing, rusty, armored, souped-up, truck. Then quickly, after the most important discovery in the film, the rest of the plot flies around like an un-tied balloon. Another problem is there are many, many question's never answered. That's where the headache factor comes in. But, after watching it a second time, I did catch details I had first overlooked and it made more sense.I liked how the ending doesn't completely rely on Hollywood's normal scheme. If you see it, try and tell me that the menacing truck isn't more effective than the monster (at times). Also, how did the monster get his personalized plate?As there will undoubtably be a sequel, I hope fall's back on the material found early in the first film. I liked the movie, and recommend it, even with its faults.

679257,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005RHGK,A. Estes,"[6, 8]","Jeepers Creepers starts off with an EXTREMELY suspenseful, thrilling first act that will seriously have you at the edge of your seat with a big grin on your face. However, after the first 40 minutes or so, the movie quickly runs out of steam and just gets stuck into the mud. It's quite a shame too, with such a great set-up you expect this to be THE horror movie event of your life. The story involves a brother and sister heading home together from college on Spring break, who, like all horror movie characters, make all the bad moves (Going down deserted highways, going back to bad situations with lame excuses). On a quiet country road, they are nearly run off the road by a enormous truck. They think nothing of the matter, until later down the road they drive by the house of that same truck driver and see him dumping ""something"" wrapped in blood soaked sheets down a hole in his yard. Of course, this is a horror movie, and the characters soon make a very stupid move in the next five minutes, but I won't ruin anymore of it for you (since it's the only section of the movie you will enjoy). Needless to say, what results is very tense and exciting. As I was watching it I just kept thinking in my head, over and over, ""This is the best movie I have ever seen"" but once you see how the movie moves into it's second and third acts, you will see why this movie just bottoms out on so many levels. First of all, the ""killer"" was so much freakier and scarier when I didn't know his motive or even what he is (That just REALLY ruined the movie). Add to that some stupid psychic lady thrown into the mix for no reason, and this movie just doesn't deliver. Like I said before, it's quite sad.

While others said it ranks among the worst ever made. I had wanted to see ""Jeepers Creepers"" when it was firsted released,but, just never got around to it. Then, one day I just decided to rent it, since I'm a fan of the genre.""Jeepers Creepers"" is a movie I think that does have some suspenseful moments. I also think the film's first half bour is brilliant. And by that I mean, it's set-up is wonderful. The suspense slowly builds up because we don't know what kind of movie we are in for. We have no way of knowing where this plot will take us. As for dialogue well, the film suffers, and the movie has too many loop holes that don't bring the movie together, plus, it just gets plan silly. But, I'm getting ahead of myself here.""Jeepers Creepers"" starts off as a brother and sister Trish (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are driving home from school. Soon they encounter a strange driver on the road who nearly runs them right off the road. As they drive on, they see him again, this time, he's off the road, and they see him throwing bodies down a pipe. Now, all of this believe it or not works. But, what happens inbetween this, doesn't work.First of all, the two kids start talking about their mother. Okay, what about her? I don't know. They say that she's change, that she;s not herself anymore. OK, why? Does she have a physical problem? Is she breaking up with her husband? Did her husband die? Or is she just lonely? We never know. Information is given to us, but, it's never completed. We know Trish (Gina Philips) breaks up with her boyfriend, why? The writers were just trying to make this characters have a conversation for the film doesn't become boring until the action happens. But, why make the characters talk about things that won't have anything to do with the movie. We don't want to hear it. Why not try writing USEFUL dialogue?After the first half hour, the film become odd, but, I was willing to go along with it. We find out something about the driver in the begining of the movie (don't worry I won't spoil it). And then we start to second guess our opinion of why we rented this in the first place. So now, the film just becomes silly. Here's an example, the kids are soon told they whenever they hear the Harry Warren song ""Jeepers Creepers"" expect trouble. Never in all my life would I have expected the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" to represent evil! Also, we are told that the ""crepper"" attacks ever 23 years! And the funny thing is, no one else knows about this. That leads to another question. Exactly how long has this been going on?Director Victor Salva is not a talentless director I feel. He might be able to actually make a good, scary horror flick one of these days. He just needs to prepare himself better. That's what really breaks this film. The elements are there for a good movie, but, they just weren't used properly. Maybe ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" will be better. Who knows. I personally would advise you not to watch this movie.

In an age of digital effects, where any work of magic can be executed on camera, director Vic Salvo still understands that what is most effective is what you cannot see. Some of the scariest scenes take place in shadows and corners where our view is obstructed and the terror is based on sound. Even the highly distinctive Creeper is hardly ever seen in full light.The film relies on what is called ""idiot plot"" in order to get things going. A brother and sister on a cross-country drive see something they shouldn't, and the brother arrives at a questionable decision to investigate a very dangerous situation in a remote place. The idiot plot goes over the edge when he decides to crawl down a dark chute leading into total darkness, with his sister holding his ankles. No way. I don't believe it.What little we need to know about the creature we learn from a psychic, but her character is not developed beyond this function and she sticks out like a sore thumb - the character only exists for the sake of exposition.Otherwise, the cast of mostly unknowns are wonderful, especially Justin Long as brother Darius.

As they drive along in a more than deserted part of the countryside, they witness a macabre looking stranger doing something they can't quite believe after a near miss on the highway, and quickly begin to fear for their own safety. Without divulging too much of the storyline, the picture gathers pace from this point and more than cleverly keeps up the tension without falling into the usual gratuitous gore or fantastical scenes. Fans of this type of movie will certainly find plenty to enjoy, although the power of the movie is placed much more firmly in the psychological aspect, than the more common &quot;in your face&quot; horror, in fact there are even one or two references to the horror movie genre by the stars themselves, woven nicely into the script. The two main characters are played with huge credibility by the relative newcomers Gina Phillips and Justin Long, who are probably remembered for their recent outings in films like of Telling You &amp;  the very different Galaxy Quest respectively. Their portrayal of two very scared youngsters comes across well, and puts the viewer, easily into their situations. My only complaint about the movie would be the directors insistence on incorporating a fantastic element eventually into the direction, in an attempt to follow a supernatural theme. This works OK, but one has to say or more believable or credible explanation of the events we are seeing, would have been even better.The movie has something of a low budget feel, but this is not in any way detrimental to the story, and almost adds something to the feeling of isolation in the locations depicted. All this said, this is a very well made movie with more than a few suprises along the way, and an ending that is certainly not &quot;out of the box&quot;.

For me and this is my opinion, this has to be one of the worst horror flicks in recent years, along with Cabin Fever. My husband and I were left staring at the screen in awe of how bad it was. I seriously felt my brain cells possibly melting away with every minute I watched it.I try not to write bad reviews, because everyone tastes are so different, but nothing about this movie was great. The acting left much to be desired. The filmed lacked intensity. While the plot wasn't terrible, it could have been been delivered in a much more entertaining way. While it had plenty of gore, it was missing the ""sitting at the edge of your seat"" feeling. Instead of biting my nails, I was scratching my head wondering what the heck were they thinking.All in all, I was bored out of my mind.

Pinto,"[1, 1]","Someone reviewed this movie before and wrote what i'm about to say again:""I suppose that a lot of people going to the movies today have grown up on such tripe as Scary Movie, the Friday the 13th series and other crappy horror films. I suppose these same people expect that every little detail of a film must be explained on an adolescent's level, so as not to confuse them while they watch the films with their eyes as their mouths cannot keep from running while in the theatre. It's a funny thing - sound when added to a film allowed for certain nuances of the theatre to be present, so that the visual didn't have to do all the work. So to those who would call this film bad, I say: turn off your cell phone, stop talking to your buddies, and pay attention to the movie.Jeepers Creepers isn't the finest horror film ever made, but it certainly is one that can scare the bejesus out of you. Certainly there are very standard plot devices in action here - but isn't that part of the formula for a horror film? ...Jeepers starts off using bits and pieces of known scare tactics and then milks them with a wink and a nudge. Should the lead characters go back and see whats up at that creepy looking house where the even creepier looking guy was ....? Of course not! The characters even acknowledge this fact. However, pulled by the same force that requires everyone passing an accident to rubberneck, they do. (And let's face it - if they didn't - the movie wouldn't have been made).At once scary, silly, laughable, and immensely frustrating, Jeepers Creepers shows us a new (albeit traditional and truly old hat) villain: a monster! .Just what this monster wants is never fully explained as the film truly frustrates us by setting itself up for an obvious sequel (which I truly hope gets made).The film features fine actors performing honestly and well. Eileen Brennan appears in an extended cameo that is quite unforgettable. The script is good, the cinematography is quite well done.When you get up from a horror film, you are hopefully intelligent enough to know that the action on the screen is not possible in the real world. You have just been treated to little fright akin to a ride on a good roller coaster. If the movie made you jump, squirm, turn from the screen, or possibly yelp, then its done its job.Jeepers Creepers does far more than that. This is a good film that delivers on the scares and leaves you wanting more.Check it out!""So that's it, hope this review have helped you choose this movie ....... trust me you won't regret it ^^",4,GREAT SUSPENSE / TERROR MOVIE,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,2549,"['Someone', 'reviewed', 'movie', 'wrote', 'what', 'i', ""'m"", 'say', 'again', 'suppose', 'lot', 'people', 'going', 'movies', 'today', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'such', 'tripe', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'Friday', '13th', 'series', 'other', 'crappy', 'horror', 'films', 'suppose', 'same', 'people', 'expect', 'little', 'detail', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'explained', 'adolescent', 'level', 'so', 'not', 'confuse', 'watch', 'films', 'eyes', 'mouths', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'running', 'while', 'theatre', 'funny', 'thing', 'sound', 'when', 'added', 'film', 'allowed', 'certain', 'nuances', 'theatre', 'be', 'present', 'visual', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'work', 'So', 'who', 'would', 'call', 'film', 'bad', 'say', 'turn', 'off', 'cell', 'phone', 'stop', 'talking', 'buddies', 'pay', 'attention', 'movie.Jeepers', 'Creepers', ""n't"", 'finest', 'horror', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'certainly', 'one', 'can', 'scare', 'bejesus', 'Certainly', 'are', 'very', 'standard', 'plot', 'devices', 'action', 'here', ""n't"", 'part', 'formula', 'horror', 'film', 'Jeepers', 'using', 'bits', 'pieces', 'known', 'scare', 'tactics', 'then', 'milks', 'wink', 'nudge', 'Should', 'lead', 'characters', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'whats', 'up', 'creepy', 'looking', 'house', 'where', 'even', 'creepier', 'looking', 'guy', 'was', 'course', 'not', 'characters', 'even', 'acknowledge', 'fact', 'However', 'pulled', 'same', 'force', 'everyone', 'passing', 'accident', 'rubberneck', 'do', 'let', 'face', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', '.At', 'once', 'scary', 'silly', 'laughable', 'immensely', 'frustrating', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'new', 'albeit', 'traditional', 'truly', 'old', 'hat', 'villain', 'monster', '.Just', 'what', 'monster', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'film', 'truly', 'setting', 'up', 'obvious', 'sequel', 'truly', 'hope', 'made', '.The', 'film', 'features', 'fine', 'actors', 'performing', 'honestly', 'well', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'extended', 'cameo', 'quite', 'unforgettable', 'script', 'good', 'cinematography', 'quite', 'well', 'done.When', 'get', 'up', 'horror', 'film', 'are', 'hopefully', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'know', 'action', 'screen', 'not', 'possible', 'real', 'world', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'treated', 'little', 'fright', 'akin', 'ride', 'good', 'roller', 'coaster', 'movie', 'made', 'jump', 'squirm', 'turn', 'screen', 'possibly', 'yelp', 'then', 'done', 'job.Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'far', 'more', 'good', 'film', 'scares', 'wanting', 'more.Check', 'out', 'hope', 'review', 'have', 'helped', 'choose', 'movie', 'trust', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', '^^']",Jeepers Creepers
679274,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B00005RHGK,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[12, 15]","Trish and Darry Jenner are brother and sister coming back home via the back roads for the holiday break. Their journey is uneventful until they are terrorised by 'some jerk' in a beat up old truck - an event they get over until they later see the driver unloading what looks like bodies into a hole as they drive past. Escaping the ensuing chase, Darry insists they go back to see what he was doing - something he deeply regrets doing when he finds mutilated and preserved bodies all over the inside of the pit. They escape the truck again but their attempts to get help lead to nothing and they find themselves battling much more than the psycho driver that they first feared.This film was overly praised on its release because it was refreshingly free of the self-awareness and irony that many modern horrors had been full of since Scream. For my money though, the lack of irony didn't mean it would be a good horror movie and, not being good with the scary stuff at the best of times I decided to give it a miss. When it came on TV, I decided to give it a go even though I'm not really a fan of the teen horror genre. However this film is actually a lot better than the normal teen horrors because, like the critics said, it isn't full of the usual clich&eacute;s and so on. Instead the plot is a pretty tense and simple affair where we are only given two teens rather than a group that will slowly be picked off. The film is not terrifying but it is pretty creepy and has a good, consistent tone to it that is quite unnerving.The strength of the film is that it doesn't lose momentum when the creature is revealed; usually modern creature features lose a lot of their tension when the (usually CGI) beast is fully seen. Here we have several stages (truck/shadow/man/creepy man/beast) and they all are effective. Salva directs well and injects a good sense of tension into the film but he also knows how to frame a shot - his use of darkness and the tunnel spotlight effect both being pretty effective. Of course it is still just a horror movie and is not perfect but I must admit that I was drawn into it easily early on, even if it did tend to flag a bit as it progresses.Even though it is not strictly a teen horror, we still have to put up with two rather annoying teenagers in the lead role but I suppose that is to be expected from Salva - according to the courts he has worked with minors before! In fairness to both the actors in the lead roles, they do pretty well, managing to come across real when required (as opposed to fodder filler) but also seeming genuinely afraid. Both Phillips and Long were better than I expected and did well acting as the core of the film. The creature itself is also a good presence even if it does lose a little bit of its creepiness when the wings come out.Overall this was a surprisingly enjoyable horror movie but of course it is still a teen horror of sorts so don't assume that it will be perfect - it still does pretty much what you expect it to. Like the critics though, I enjoyed its lack of knowing cynicism and it did have a good sense of pace and tension even if it wasn't really 'horrifying'. Still a teen horror then, but one that is better than the norm and worth seeing if you like the genre.",4,still a teenage horror flick but much better than the majority of the other movies in this genre,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,3251,"['Trish', 'Darry', 'Jenner', 'are', 'brother', 'sister', 'coming', 'back', 'home', 'back', 'roads', 'holiday', 'break', 'journey', 'uneventful', 'are', 'terrorised', ""'some"", 'jerk', 'beat', 'up', 'old', 'truck', 'event', 'get', 'later', 'see', 'driver', 'unloading', 'what', 'like', 'bodies', 'hole', 'drive', 'past', 'Escaping', 'ensuing', 'chase', 'Darry', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'something', 'regrets', 'doing', 'when', 'mutilated', 'preserved', 'bodies', 'inside', 'pit', 'escape', 'truck', 'again', 'attempts', 'get', 'help', 'lead', 'nothing', 'find', 'battling', 'much', 'more', 'psycho', 'driver', 'first', 'feared.This', 'film', 'was', 'overly', 'praised', 'release', 'was', 'refreshingly', 'free', 'self-awareness', 'irony', 'many', 'modern', 'horrors', 'had', 'been', 'full', 'Scream', 'money', 'lack', 'irony', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'good', 'scary', 'stuff', 'best', 'times', 'decided', 'give', 'miss', 'When', 'came', 'TV', 'decided', 'give', 'go', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'fan', 'teen', 'horror', 'genre', 'However', 'film', 'actually', 'lot', 'better', 'normal', 'teen', 'horrors', 'because', 'critics', 'said', ""n't"", 'full', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'so', 'Instead', 'plot', 'pretty', 'tense', 'simple', 'affair', 'where', 'are', 'only', 'given', 'two', 'teens', 'rather', 'group', 'will', 'slowly', 'be', 'picked', 'off', 'film', 'not', 'terrifying', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'good', 'consistent', 'tone', 'quite', 'unnerving.The', 'strength', 'film', ""n't"", 'lose', 'momentum', 'when', 'creature', 'revealed', 'usually', 'modern', 'creature', 'features', 'lose', 'lot', 'tension', 'when', 'usually', 'CGI', 'beast', 'fully', 'seen', 'Here', 'have', 'several', 'stages', 'man/beast', 'are', 'effective', 'Salva', 'well', 'good', 'sense', 'tension', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'frame', 'shot', 'use', 'darkness', 'tunnel', 'spotlight', 'effect', 'being', 'pretty', 'effective', 'course', 'still', 'just', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'drawn', 'easily', 'early', 'even', 'did', 'tend', 'flag', 'bit', 'not', 'strictly', 'teen', 'horror', 'still', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'two', 'rather', 'annoying', 'teenagers', 'lead', 'role', 'suppose', 'be', 'expected', 'Salva', 'according', 'courts', 'worked', 'minors', 'fairness', 'actors', 'lead', 'roles', 'do', 'pretty', 'well', 'managing', 'come', 'real', 'when', 'required', 'opposed', 'fodder', 'filler', 'also', 'seeming', 'genuinely', 'afraid', 'Phillips', 'Long', 'were', 'better', 'expected', 'did', 'well', 'acting', 'core', 'film', 'creature', 'also', 'good', 'presence', 'even', 'lose', 'little', 'bit', 'creepiness', 'when', 'wings', 'come', 'out.Overall', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'horror', 'movie', 'course', 'still', 'teen', 'horror', 'sorts', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'still', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expect', 'critics', 'enjoyed', 'lack', 'knowing', 'cynicism', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'sense', 'pace', 'tension', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', ""'horrifying"", 'Still', 'teen', 'horror', 'then', 'one', 'better', 'norm', 'worth', 'seeing', 'like', 'genre']",Jeepers Creepers

I was not expecting much of anything since the movie got a horrible average rating. Don't let that fool you. The movie isn't great art, but it's wonderfully put together and delivers an hour and a half of innocent entertainment. A brother and sister are traveling back home for spring break. The brother's name is Darry(Justin Long), and the sister is Trisha(Gina Phillips). Their road trip seems to be pretty typical. Playing licence plate games and talking. They seem to hit on the subject that their parents' marriage is iin trouble, and that Trish's own relationship is over. Things go horrible when a big, dumpy looking truck begins tailing them on the highway. The truck scares them a little and then moves on. The siblings later see the truck parked at an abandoned church. A strange looking figure is taking objects wrapped up in sheets and dumping them down a pipe. After another cat and mouse scene between the two cars, the two go back to investigate, thinking they were bodies and that someone else may be alive. Once they find out that it was bodies that were being dumped, Darry also discovers that there are hundreds of bodies in this basement that are preserved and sewn up. From this point on, the brother and sister team struggle to contact help and to flee from this psycho. When they have an encounter with a psychic named Jezelle(Patricia Belcher), they learn of what is really going on. This monster is a regurgating monster that needs to eat body parts to stay alive. Whatever he eats, and you know what he eats, becomes a part of him. Every 23 years, he feeds. She also tells them that whenever the title song plays, something terrible is about to happen. It all ends with a climax that takes place in a locked down police station that was exciting and shot nicely. The movie was written and directed by Victor Salva, the man who did ""Powder"". He has a nice eye and give us some nice shots and fun angles with the camera. He really sets the setting and makes it eerie and intriguing. The film is pretty much straight terror, but there are some comical moments spread out here and there. While it's a film that can't be taken seriously, it appears to be a fillm that was taken seriously from Salva and his cast and crew. They wanted to put together an incredibly fun, thrill ride and they have done just that. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It is what it is and it does it very competently. It delivers in the 'fun' category. The monster itself is very creepy, and very nightmarish. The make-up design of the creature was very good. The acting is all pretty solid. Gina Phillips, not only being beautiful in the classic sense, was a strong heroine. She was tough and ballsy. Justin Long did a decent job as her terrified brother. Veteran actress Eileen Brennan pops up as The Cat Lady, in a set piece that's one of the better ones. Jonathan Breck plays the monster. He does a good job in bringing out the creeps in the role. The film differs from horror films of the last few years. While it was praised as being away from the ""Scream"" era, it really isn't. There are some lines in the film that would of been right at home in any of the ""Scream"" films. Plus, these are two different types of films, and shouldn't be compared. ""Jeepers Creepers"" was a lot better than I thought it would be. If I had listened to bad reviews and the low average rating, I would have missed out on a pretty fun and entertaining film. I was pleasantly surprised. I think any fan of films like this would be too.",3,"""....Where'd You Get Those Peepers....""",1048118400,"03 20, 2003",2003,3653,"['next', 'time', 'somebody', 'road', 'trips', 'are', 'fun', 'slap', 'face', 'doing', 'tell', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'anything', 'movie', 'got', 'horrible', 'average', 'rating', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'movie', ""n't"", 'great', 'art', 'wonderfully', 'put', 'together', 'delivers', 'hour', 'half', 'innocent', 'entertainment', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'traveling', 'back', 'home', 'spring', 'break', 'brother', 'name', 'Darry', 'Justin', 'Long', 'sister', 'Trisha', 'Gina', 'Phillips', 'road', 'trip', 'be', 'pretty', 'typical', 'Playing', 'licence', 'plate', 'games', 'talking', 'seem', 'hit', 'subject', 'parents', 'marriage', 'iin', 'trouble', 'Trish', 'own', 'relationship', 'Things', 'go', 'horrible', 'when', 'big', 'dumpy', 'looking', 'truck', 'tailing', 'highway', 'truck', 'little', 'then', 'moves', 'siblings', 'later', 'see', 'truck', 'parked', 'abandoned', 'church', 'strange', 'looking', 'figure', 'taking', 'objects', 'wrapped', 'up', 'sheets', 'dumping', 'down', 'pipe', 'cat', 'mouse', 'scene', 'two', 'cars', 'two', 'go', 'back', 'investigate', 'thinking', 'were', 'bodies', 'someone', 'else', 'may', 'be', 'alive', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'bodies', 'were', 'being', 'dumped', 'Darry', 'also', 'are', 'hundreds', 'bodies', 'basement', 'are', 'preserved', 'sewn', 'up', 'point', 'brother', 'sister', 'team', 'struggle', 'contact', 'help', 'flee', 'psycho', 'When', 'have', 'encounter', 'psychic', 'named', 'Jezelle', 'Patricia', 'Belcher', 'learn', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'monster', 'regurgating', 'monster', 'eat', 'body', 'parts', 'stay', 'alive', 'know', 'what', 'part', '23', 'years', 'also', 'title', 'song', 'plays', 'something', 'terrible', 'happen', 'climax', 'place', 'locked', 'down', 'police', 'station', 'was', 'exciting', 'shot', 'nicely', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'Powder', 'nice', 'eye', 'give', 'nice', 'shots', 'fun', 'angles', 'camera', 'really', 'setting', 'eerie', 'intriguing', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight', 'terror', 'are', 'comical', 'moments', 'spread', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'be', 'fillm', 'was', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Salva', 'cast', 'crew', 'wanted', 'put', 'together', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'thrill', 'ride', 'have', 'done', 'just', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', 'else', 'what', 'very', 'competently', ""'fun"", 'category', 'monster', 'very', 'creepy', 'very', 'nightmarish', 'make-up', 'design', 'creature', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'pretty', 'solid', 'Gina', 'Phillips', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'beautiful', 'classic', 'sense', 'was', 'strong', 'heroine', 'was', 'tough', 'ballsy', 'Justin', 'Long', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'terrified', 'brother', 'Veteran', 'actress', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'up', 'Cat', 'Lady', 'set', 'piece', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'Jonathan', 'Breck', 'monster', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'out', 'creeps', 'role', 'film', 'differs', 'horror', 'films', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'was', 'praised', 'being', 'away', 'Scream', 'era', 'really', ""n't"", 'are', 'lines', 'film', 'would', 'been', 'right', 'home', 'Scream', 'films', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'types', 'films', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'compared', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'listened', 'bad', 'reviews', 'low', 'average', 'rating', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'pretty', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'film', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'think', 'fan', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'too']",Jeepers Creepers
679282,A1OUEDUZ4AHVIZ,B00005RHGK,"Ben Stubbs ""Horror / Metal Enthusiast""","[1, 1]","""Jeepers Creepers"" is a fairly stupid name for a horror movie. It certainly didn't inspire confidence in me that this would be anything but another lame teenager based slasher flick. As it turns out, ""Jeepers Creepers"" is much better than it sounds, and while it falls a bit short of classic status, is certainly not to be underestimated.Darry and Trish Jenner are traveling home for spring break when they are violently harassed by a seemingly psychotic truck driver. Soon after they witness the same driver dumping what appear to be bodies wrapped in sheets into a drainpipe. From this point on, the siblings are torn between helping the victims and escaping this malevolent madman intent on tracking them down. To make matters even worse, it soon becomes apparent that their attacker is far from human.I'll start with the positives here. The first half an hour of this movie is sensational! If it had managed to keep the standard set in this early period for the entire running time, it would indeed be a fine horror movie. Darry and Trish have fabulous, believable brother and sister chemistry. Their acting may not be award quality, but it's far above typical horror genre fare. When the terror starts, and it starts within the first few minutes, the viewer already has a connection with these characters and that's a credit to the actors and the direction of Victor Salva. These first scenes are seriously intense and I love it. To continue with the positives, the creature itself (The Creeper) looks fantastic. They really created a horrific and fascinating being. Without giving too much away, the filmmakers slowly reveal more and more features of The Creeper as the movie goes on. By the end of the film, you can see him in all his glory and it's a quite a site to behold.So why don't I consider this to be a classic? Basically, it goes downhill in the second half of the film. I've always been opposed to the use of psychics to tell a story and ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a classic case. With no easy way to tell the audience of the monster's history, nor his reasons for killing, the writers created a psychic woman that for reasons completely unexplained, has a complete knowledge of not only The Creeper but can also see into the future. I admit, it's not done terribly, but it does annoy me. Secondly, ""Jeepers Creepers"" can't quite decide whether it takes itself seriously or not. In my opinion, the first half worked so well due to its intensity and the seriousness of the scenario. Once it starts making self-referential gags and The Creeper starts whistling the Jeepers Creepers tune, I feel it loses that intensity. There seems to be quite a market at the moment for movies that mix comedy with horror. I just feel this wasn't the movie to do it.Do the positives outweigh the negatives? Yeah, I think so. I really enjoy the movie as a whole and recommend it to any fan of creature features and horror in general. The sequel also has some merit and I hope we see more of The Creeper in years to come.",4,"Fantastic, intense first half is let down towards the end.

On a long, lonely stretch of highway, they encounter a maniac driving a suped up truck that's as fast as a rocket-sled! Said maniac keeps crashing into the rear of their car and zooms off around them and into the distance. While still recovering from this experience, Trish and Darry see this guy loading what appear to be bodies (wrapped in bloody sheets) down a pipe by an old abandoned church. Of course, they simply MUST investigate or there wouldn't be much of a movie now would there? So, when the big guy leaves, they go to the pipe, where Darry hears what sounds like a faint human moan. He scoots into the pipe, only to fall in and down into the damp darkness below! Once there, Darry discovers not only a poor dying kid with a stitched-up chest, but also an entire ceiling covered with hundreds of well-preserved victims of the madman in the truck! This is no ordinary stalker / slasher story after all. Darry, now in shock, staggers up and out through the church and Trish drives them to a diner to call the police. It just gets creepier from there. A psychic calls them at the diner with information she couldn't possibly have. The cops arrive, while outside, the ""creeper"" has gone through Darry's dirty laundry, getting his scent. The creeper is one of the better movie monsters (nope, he ain't human) I've seen over the years. He'll definitely stick in your head! Cops have no hope against him / it as he comes for what he needs / wants from Darry. The beginning is a lot like Spielberg's ""Duel"" in it's relentless chase between car and truck. The unveiling of the creeper's cathedral of death reminded me of the discovery of the queen's egg-chamber in ""Aliens"" or the livingroom scene in the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", shocking and disturbing. Also, there's a scene at the police station that reminded me of Arnold's infamous ""I'll be Back!"" sequence in ""The Terminator"". I don't consider these ripoffs. I call them tributes. JEEPERS CREEPERS is one of the best horror movies I've seen in years. It's certainly better than most of the lame ""Scream""-ish clones floating around.

679285,A3E1UIGSVRQXQ,B00005RHGK,"Bobby Brady ""Radioman970""","[0, 0]","There are many movies like this but most don't quite reach the level of Jeepers Creepers.  Nightmare On Elm Street, Silence Of The Lambs, Creature From The Black Lagoon and even Aliens are inspirations for this fine horror outing.  That's not to say that it is better than all of those.  But you'll be reminded of these and other similar good horror movies such as Pumpkinhead.  Excellent acting (Gina is a honey!), writing, special effects and visually striking overall.  I was on the edge of my seat through most of it.  Unless you are only into hardcore or if you are somewhat squeemish you'll find a lot to like.  If there are any weaknesses it can be blamed on budget limitations.  The filmmakers should be happy with the final results (the commentary supports that).  Very spooky.  Love the unpredictable ending (commentary mentions some viewers disappointment with the ending...not me).  Most moviemakers would have ended it differently.  I'm really hoping for Jeepers Creepers 2.  There are some ideas that are not fully explored; again, because of budget constaints.  I'd like a bit more humor (like Nightmare on Elm Street) but it was a smart move to keep the Creeper demon silent and mostly humorless.  Freddie he ain't.  And that's a good thing.  Another strength is the main characters are brother-sister and not boyfriend-girlfriend.  Watch and you'll discover way this works so well.  What I don't understand is why this isn't done more.I rented mine but will probably buy it here when the price drops (perfect for my month long October horror movie marathon).  The DVD picture and sound are both excellent.  It's a doublesided disc with movie on one side and lots of extras on the other.  It has a nice selection of deleted scenes.  Dig that alternate ending!  Not to give anything away, but in that final shot I would've liked to see him perched instead of sitting on a stool.  It begs the question Is He A Demon Or Something From This World?  He looks a little too much like Freddie Kruger at times.  But with that axe he has a reaper-thing going.  To give credit where credit is due, there is a terrific scene near the end against a window that really establishes this as a demon removed from the others.  I'll just say ""face wings"".  Also, the commentary mentions that it ""steals clothes from it's victoms over the years"".  Very eery stuff.  Don't pass over the documentary (done just for the dvd) it's very good; showing all the production steps.  Future movie makers should use this as a reference.Favorite scene:  Creeper on top of the patrol car.Favorite line:  ""What have you brought to my house?""",4,A step above most of its kind.,1013817600,"02 16, 2002",2002,2622,"['are', 'many', 'movies', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'level', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Creature', 'Black', 'Lagoon', 'even', 'Aliens', 'are', 'inspirations', 'fine', 'horror', 'outing', 'not', 'say', 'better', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reminded', 'other', 'similar', 'good', 'horror', 'movies', 'such', 'Pumpkinhead', 'Excellent', 'acting', 'Gina', 'honey', 'writing', 'special', 'effects', 'visually', 'striking', 'overall', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'most', 'are', 'only', 'hardcore', 'are', 'somewhat', 'squeemish', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'like', 'are', 'weaknesses', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'budget', 'limitations', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'be', 'happy', 'final', 'results', 'commentary', 'Very', 'spooky', 'Love', 'unpredictable', 'ending', 'commentary', 'mentions', 'viewers', 'disappointment', 'ending', 'not', 'Most', 'moviemakers', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'differently', ""'m"", 'really', 'hoping', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'are', 'ideas', 'are', 'not', 'fully', 'explored', 'again', 'budget', 'constaints', ""'d"", 'like', 'bit', 'more', 'humor', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'was', 'smart', 'move', 'keep', 'Creeper', 'demon', 'silent', 'mostly', 'humorless', 'Freddie', 'ai', ""n't"", 'good', 'thing', 'strength', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'brother-sister', 'not', 'boyfriend-girlfriend', 'Watch', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'way', 'so', 'well', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', ""n't"", 'done', 'more.I', 'rented', 'mine', 'will', 'probably', 'buy', 'here', 'when', 'price', 'drops', 'perfect', 'month', 'long', 'October', 'horror', 'movie', 'marathon', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'doublesided', 'disc', 'movie', 'one', 'side', 'lots', 'extras', 'other', 'nice', 'selection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Dig', 'alternate', 'ending', 'Not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'final', 'shot', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'perched', 'instead', 'sitting', 'stool', 'question', 'A', 'Demon', 'Or', 'Something', 'World', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Freddie', 'Kruger', 'times', 'axe', 'reaper-thing', 'going', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'terrific', 'scene', 'end', 'window', 'really', 'demon', 'removed', 'others', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'face', 'wings', 'Also', 'commentary', 'mentions', 'steals', 'clothes', 'victoms', 'years', 'Very', 'eery', 'stuff', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'documentary', 'done', 'just', 'dvd', 'very', 'good', 'showing', 'production', 'steps', 'Future', 'movie', 'makers', 'should', 'use', 'reference.Favorite', 'scene', 'Creeper', 'top', 'patrol', 'car.Favorite', 'line', 'What', 'have', 'brought', 'house']",Jeepers Creepers

Trish and Darry are stalked by a terrifying man-eating creature while on their way home for spring break in 2001's JEEPERS CREEPERS! Victor Salva directs from his own original screenplay, which is lazy, messy, and misguided from the very start. JEEPERS CREEPERS opens as a suspenseful thriller, before revealing that the killer creature is actually rooted in the supernatural. Whenever the action lulls or our interest in the characters begins to fade, Salva throws in some desperate new gimmick to try and gain back his lost momentum without ever actually attempting to improve upon the story itself. The creature goes from being an axe-wielding maniac to being a cannibalistic ghoul to then tranforming into a cannibalistic ghoul with wings and mandibles which serve no other purpose than to show off the flashy special effects. At one point, Salva writes himself into a corner when attempting to explain the creature's origin or why it only eats certain people and parts of the body, and hence ""Jezelle the Psychic"" is born out of convenience and necessity. If we are to believe that the creature can only replenish its limbs and vital organs by eating the flesh of its victims, just how is it supposed to grow back those wings, anyway?

679294,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B00005RHGK,casualsuede,"[0, 0]","I personally believe the Horror movie industry began a slow decline in the mid 1980's. It seemed like every possibility had been used up and audiences could not longer be spooked with gory special effects or imaginative use of the cinema camera. Auteurs like Dario Argento, Mario Bava, George Romero and even hacks like Lucio Fulci began to get progressively worse as the 1980's wore on. At this time, American horror movies began the development of ""character"" driven horror movies (since the good guys where all victims, only the baddies could get character development) and this led to serial series including horror stalwarts such as Freddie Krueger, Michael Myers, Jason Voohees as well as lesser knowns like the Tall Man (Phantasm). These serial horror movies (Jason X, Freddie VII, Halloween H20, Puppet Master 15) led to the downfall, because while the series runs out of ideas after the second movie, the movies are continued to be made.The 1990's brought some interesting ideas. I liked movies like People Under the Stairs (1991), Scream (1996) and others, but the genre has not recovered. In the early 1980's, Jeepers Creepers would not be considered much of an atmospheric movie (compared to movies like ""The Fog"" or ""The keep""), but in a genre in which movies like Jason X and The Haunting exist, Jeeper's Creepers does pretty well.The movie starts with a brother and sister pair going home for Spring Break. Darry (short for Darius) is the younger brother, who is a goof and easy going. Trish is the older, more cynical sister. As they drive, they play silly road games (like we all used to during long road trips) and pick on each other, however, there is always an air of tension in the air that lingers even in the most lightest moments. It is helped by the fact that the soundtrack is very much in the background, not manipulating the audience.Terror does appear in the form of an old battered truck that terrorizes the teens. It is an homage to Duel, one of my favorite movies of the 1970's. However, soon we find out the identity of the driver as the kids pass by and see him dropping body bags into a sewer. In a scene that defies all logic, but falls under the ""rules"" that govern horror movies, the two go back and investigate what is happening. What they find is horrifying, but not too original (Salva and his production designer must have seen one Coffin Joe movie too much).The being catches their scent and begins tracking them down and the movies turns into a cat and mouse game, with the protagonists frantically running and the antagonist turning into the indistructible shape. While the movie begins to term generic and the baddies turns into another Freddie like character, the ending was great and does provide a slight twist.Victor Salva, who was notorious as being the ""child molester"" director has directed two movies that I have seen. Clownhouse is a low budget movie that was fairly well done, but his first big budget movie ""Powder"" was simply horrible. With Jeepers Creepers he starts out well, but as the story develops, the audience learns too much of the creature and it begins to lose it's mystique (One of the reason why the movie Duel was so great was because we never understand the motives of the crazy trucker). At the end we find out he's just another movie monster, another demon that has no appeal because the only thing that makes it interesting is taken away from it.The brother and sister duo do better. They are believable as siblings and do what they can with the simplistic script. However, they are not given a chance to progress their relationship past the setup phase so when one of the siblings are taken away from the other, we don't feel the great sense of loss that we should.Overall, this movie is good in a genre that has consistently given us crap over the past 15 years. But, this movie is in no way going to be a classic.....Rating: C+The DVD has several featuers, but it is not full of them. The minimalistic soundtrack gets creepy at the right momemts and has decent (but not great) dynamic punch.

But the graphic violence is minimal, and much emphasis is placed on the relationship between the two adolescent siblings, Trish and Darry. Their sibling rivalry, with its petty bickering and silly games that only the two of them understand is refreshingly accurate, and they don't become all lovey-dovey when trouble comes their way.And trouble they have. A demon who, according to psychic Jezelle [Patricia Belcher] is permitted to feed for 23 days every 23 years is on day 22 of its eating binge. It captures young healthy people whose scent makes it wild with desire. It takes only certain parts, eyes to help it see, hearts to help its own heart stay strong and beating, and so on. Then it sews up the corpses to preserve them in a quilt, which it keeps in the basement of an old church (desecrated, no doubt). When Trish and Derry see one of the demon's sewn up, quilt-bound bodies dropped through an old pipe that leads into the basement of the church, they feel compelled to go back and see if they can help the victim. But the victim is beyond help, and now the demon has their scent, and it loves what it smells of one of them--which one, we do not know. But the demon is after them as a final addition to its collection.Along the way, Trish and Darry never suddenly turn into best friends--they annoy the heck out of each other up until the very end. But they do band together, as siblings will, and their private games and one-ups-manship tells us that their relationship is deeper than either would admit. The love-hate feelings of siblings is very well done, and is one of the highlights of the movie. Too, like most horror movies with teen protagonists, we never see parents, and parents would be of no help. This movie, and others like it are an allegory for the transition to adulthood that we all must make on our own.I do wish they'd thought more about the title, but Jeepers Creepers is an effective coming-of-age movie, with authentic characterizations and a fairy tale plot in a modern setting, with the traditional fairy tale goal--make the transition alive.",4,An effective coming-of-age tale with a terrible title,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,2174,"['ridiculous', 'title', 'movie', 'might', 'assume', 'teen', 'slasher', 'gore-fest', 'graphic', 'violence', 'minimal', 'much', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'relationship', 'two', 'adolescent', 'siblings', 'Trish', 'Darry', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'petty', 'bickering', 'silly', 'games', 'only', 'two', 'understand', 'refreshingly', 'accurate', 'do', ""n't"", 'become', 'lovey-dovey', 'when', 'trouble', 'way.And', 'trouble', 'have', 'A', 'demon', 'who', 'according', 'psychic', 'Jezelle', '[', 'Patricia', 'Belcher', ']', 'permitted', 'feed', '23', 'days', '23', 'years', 'day', '22', 'eating', 'binge', 'young', 'healthy', 'people', 'scent', 'wild', 'desire', 'only', 'certain', 'parts', 'eyes', 'help', 'see', 'hearts', 'help', 'own', 'heart', 'stay', 'strong', 'beating', 'so', 'Then', 'up', 'corpses', 'preserve', 'quilt', 'basement', 'old', 'church', 'desecrated', 'doubt', 'When', 'Trish', 'Derry', 'see', 'one', 'demon', 'sewn', 'up', 'quilt-bound', 'bodies', 'dropped', 'old', 'pipe', 'basement', 'church', 'feel', 'compelled', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'can', 'help', 'victim', 'victim', 'help', 'now', 'demon', 'scent', 'what', 'one', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'demon', 'final', 'addition', 'collection.Along', 'way', 'Trish', 'Darry', 'never', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'best', 'friends', 'annoy', 'heck', 'other', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'do', 'band', 'together', 'siblings', 'will', 'private', 'games', 'one-ups-manship', 'tells', 'relationship', 'deeper', 'would', 'admit', 'love-hate', 'feelings', 'siblings', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'highlights', 'movie', 'Too', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'teen', 'protagonists', 'never', 'see', 'parents', 'parents', 'would', 'be', 'help', 'movie', 'others', 'are', 'allegory', 'transition', 'adulthood', 'must', 'make', 'own.I', 'do', ""'d"", 'thought', 'more', 'title', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'effective', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'authentic', 'characterizations', 'fairy', 'tale', 'plot', 'modern', 'setting', 'traditional', 'fairy', 'tale', 'goal', 'make', 'transition', 'alive']",Jeepers Creepers

The only thing scary was how quickly we wasted $7. Hey, I will give you that the first 15-20 minutes of the film is great. There is a nice attempt to set the mood and get you interested. Then... well, I am not sure what happened. All the interest and scariness get destroyed by stupid, predictible plot twists. They have even thrown in the vaugue, overweight psychic for good measure. Why would the killer need an ax when he can obviously just tear victims to pieces? Why do they bother to show us bodies that have been sewn back togther. Why is the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" mentioned as an omen of approaching doom and then only used once?

They made good ones in the late 60's and the 70's/early 80's. The great horror directors (Romero, Hooper, Carpenter, etc.) have laid out the blueprints... all that needs to be done is follow them.

Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 3]","While &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; is obviously in the hands of a skilled writer/director (Victor Salva), one can't help but feel an odd sense of deja vu when watching the film play out. The set up, or the film's first 30 minutes, is terrific. The resolution however, is typical. It's odd this film would have received such glowing reviews from the nation's critics, though one suspects the presence of Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios to be a factor. &quot;If they made it, then it has to be good!&quot; It's really not.Two siblings returning home from college decide to take a detour down a lonely country highway. We know this wisecracking pair, a brother and sister, are going to encounter horror, since this is a horror film. But the way they encounter the horror, in the form of an ominous demon with a taste for human flesh, is always suspenseful and surprising. From church basements to rooms littered with dead bodies, this unlucky pair is in for a nightmare of terrifying proportions.Unfortunately for the viewer, the nightmare is far too reminiscent of &quot;Friday the 13th,&quot; &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and, most noticeably, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&quot; And don't forget to throw in &quot;Duel&quot; for good measure, as this demon prefers a juiced up truck bearing what seems to be one heck of a loud fog horn.While the kids in this film undoubtedly make some of the stupidest mistakes in the history of horror films (returning to scenes of crimes, observing crimes rather than running), I was never really distracted by this. I also appreciated the fact that beautiful young woman were never the victims in this film. In &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; men seemed to be suffering far grislier fates.What bothered me was an especially abrupt ending at the police station, a lack of explanation for why this demon was scooping up victims off the highways of Florida and the overall geekiness of Justin Long as the brother (though I think this was intentional). In fact, Mr. Long irritated me so much that the creepy conclusion amused me more than anything else.I thought Gina Philips as the sister was terrific and hope to see her again in the sequel, or perhaps a better film. Her performance was natural and commanding. It was perhaps the best aspect of &quot;Jeepers Creepers.&quot;As for the demon, well, been there done that. It certainly is not something I would want to meet in a dark alley (or on a lonely highway), but one can't help but wonder if this is yet another attempt by moviemakers to produce a title monster followed by an endless line of bad sequels.",2,Haven't we traveled this road before?,1011744000,"01 23, 2002",2002,2613,"['quot', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'quot', 'obviously', 'hands', 'skilled', 'writer/director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'odd', 'sense', 'deja', 'vu', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'play', 'out', 'set', 'up', 'film', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'terrific', 'resolution', 'however', 'typical', 'odd', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'such', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'nation', 'critics', 'one', 'presence', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Zoetrope', 'Studios', 'be', 'factor', 'quot', 'made', 'then', 'be', 'good', 'quot', 'really', 'not.Two', 'siblings', 'returning', 'home', 'college', 'decide', 'take', 'detour', 'down', 'lonely', 'country', 'highway', 'know', 'wisecracking', 'pair', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'going', 'encounter', 'horror', 'horror', 'film', 'way', 'encounter', 'horror', 'form', 'ominous', 'demon', 'taste', 'human', 'flesh', 'always', 'suspenseful', 'surprising', 'church', 'basements', 'rooms', 'littered', 'dead', 'bodies', 'unlucky', 'pair', 'nightmare', 'terrifying', 'proportions.Unfortunately', 'viewer', 'nightmare', 'far', 'too', 'reminiscent', 'quot', 'Friday', '13th', 'quot', 'quot', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'quot', 'most', 'noticeably', 'quot', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre.', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'throw', 'quot', 'Duel', 'quot', 'good', 'measure', 'demon', 'juiced', 'up', 'truck', 'bearing', 'what', 'be', 'one', 'heck', 'loud', 'fog', 'kids', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'make', 'stupidest', 'mistakes', 'history', 'horror', 'films', 'returning', 'scenes', 'crimes', 'observing', 'crimes', 'rather', 'running', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'distracted', 'also', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'were', 'never', 'victims', 'film', 'quot', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'quot', 'men', 'seemed', 'be', 'suffering', 'far', 'grislier', 'fates.What', 'bothered', 'was', 'especially', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'police', 'station', 'lack', 'explanation', 'why', 'demon', 'was', 'scooping', 'up', 'victims', 'highways', 'Florida', 'overall', 'geekiness', 'Justin', 'Long', 'brother', 'think', 'was', 'intentional', 'fact', 'Mr.', 'Long', 'irritated', 'so', 'much', 'creepy', 'conclusion', 'amused', 'more', 'anything', 'else.I', 'thought', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'sister', 'was', 'terrific', 'hope', 'see', 'again', 'sequel', 'perhaps', 'better', 'film', 'performance', 'was', 'natural', 'commanding', 'was', 'perhaps', 'best', 'aspect', 'quot', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers.', 'quot', 'demon', 'well', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'certainly', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'want', 'meet', 'dark', 'alley', 'lonely', 'highway', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'yet', 'attempt', 'moviemakers', 'produce', 'title', 'monster', 'followed', 'endless', 'line', 'bad', 'sequels']",Jeepers Creepers

It's good old-fashioned horror at it's best, with a hip cast and returning director Victor Salva.Whilst Trish (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are driving back from college for summer break, they are run off the road by a monstrous and ugly, beat-up truck with the license plate &quot;BEATINGU.&quot; Later on, they see the same truck again by an old church and realize that the driver is shoving a body down a dark pipe. When the siblings go back to investigate and try to help, what they find is beyond their wildest nightmares...and actually apart of a local psychic who knows what is going to happen next to the brother and sister.The only complaint I have about this film is the fact that the ending becomes very silly, and the way the creature becomes naked looks very computerish and spoils the old-fashioned feel of the film which is part of what made it so frightening.

Sure in a cinema stuffed with wannabe 'thrillers' it's easy for a few to get lost in the dust. But don't count JEEPERS CREEPERS out. Sure, fans of the 'slash-and-kill-yuppies-college-kids' type of movies will definately be disappointed. This type of thriller would better cater to fans of more 'psychological thrillers' where subtle visuals and eerie camera techniques drive the fear instead of 'slash-happy' action -- like Dean Koontz's &quot;PHANTOMS&quot;, and many video games like the Resident Evils and Silent Hill.I think it was great the way the 'villian' was NOT some deranged boyfriend or a lonely shop owner -- the 'Scooby Doo' villian syndrome is WAY overplayed to the point that everyone who sits down to watch a thriller immediately starts taking notes on the bit-part characters near the beginning to decipher who the bad guy ahead of time.

679302,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005RHGK,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[36, 44]","Boy, do I feel slow on the uptake...I've seen this film twice now, and I just got the 'other' meaning of the license plate on the Creeper's truck.  I guess if it were a snake, it would have bit me...oh well...I may not get there the quickest, but I will get there...eventually.  Jeepers Creepers (2001) is a fun, interesting, stylistic film that runs out of gas about halfway through, but still had enough going for it to earn critical and commercial success, spawning a sequel, Jeepers Creepers II (2003) which broke Labor Day box office records for that year.  Written and directed by the controversial Victor Salva, who also did the chilling horror film Clownhouse (1988) and Powder (1995), Jeepers Creepers brings to life (or death) a new figure in the Hollywood creature pantheon with the Creeper, a demonic looking figure that awakens every 23 years and feeds for 23 days, according to legend.The film stars Gina Phillips as Trish and Justin Long as her brother Derry, traveling together by car a lonely and desolate country highway on their way home from college.  After a scary incident with an old truck, the two witness a sinister, cloaked figure unceremoniously dumping what appears to body sized parcels wrapped in cloth and rope down a large, corrugated metal pipe next to a boarded up church.  Also parked nearby is the same truck that nearly ran them off the road earlier.  Once past the old church, the two begin to question what exactly they saw, but are soon joined again by the mysterious truck, more intent than ever now to ram their car, and drive them off the road.  After losing the truck, the two go back to the church, despite Trish's protests, to investigate.  Derry proceeds to do something stupid, and see something no human was mean to see...oh, he did confirm what they originally thought, that the figure was indeed dumping bodies down this large drain, but that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.  What other secrets are uncovered?  What is the nature of the creature?  Do Trish and Derry survive long enough to get help?I thought the makeup and such on the Creeper looked quite good and suitably malevolent.  And the revelations revealed about this character came at a nice, even clip as the plot unfolded.  There were a number of minor points where one could argue that the plot is weak or very thin, and I would have a hard time disagreeing, especially during the last half hour of the film.  I really enjoyed the scenes that focused on something in the foreground, but provided enough leeway on the screen to see something in the background, even if it was fuzzy and out of focus, before the characters on the screen understood what was happening.  Cheap scares are had here, as things pop out `and go boo!' but there is also a nice build up of real tension throughout the film, along with a smattering of comedy, usually of the sarcastic kind, to temper the horror.  The weakness of the film comes from the predictability of the second half of the film.  The original beginning had brought forth high hopes, but these hopes diminished slightly as the film eventually tread the path repetition as most end up doing, but at least this one did so with style and professionalism most uncommon with those in the same genre.  You may recognize Justin Long from TV's Ed were he plays Warren Parker Cheswick.  It's pretty much the same affable character played in this film, but a little bit older and a little more cynical.  Gina Philips is quite lovely, with her flowing, brownish hair and doe eyed appearance that conflicts with her more cynical than her brother attitude.  Both actors did a wonderful job, showing a mixture of inherent and hard earned talent, the kind gained through lots of work and dedication.The picture here, available in both wide screen and full screen, looks wonderful and crisp.  Special features include theatrical trailers, a photo gallery, deleted, extended, and alternate scenes, behind the scenes featurettes (six), and a commentary track with director Victor Salva.  Many of these features are located on the flip side of the disc, with the film being on the other side.  I guess the one thing I took away from this film more than anything else is if you see a darkened figure dumping what appears to be bodies down a sewer pipe next to an abandoned church, just keep on moving.  You can make a report at the next town, for sure, but avoid actually crawling into the pipe to confirm what you already know.Cookieman108",3,"""What the hell did you bring into my house?""",1081209600,"04 6, 2004",2004,4488,"['Boy', 'do', 'feel', 'slow', 'uptake', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'twice', 'now', 'just', 'got', ""'other"", 'meaning', 'license', 'plate', 'Creeper', 'truck', 'guess', 'were', 'snake', 'would', 'have', 'bit', 'oh', 'well', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'there', 'quickest', 'will', 'get', 'there', 'eventually', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2001', 'fun', 'interesting', 'stylistic', 'film', 'gas', 'halfway', 'still', 'had', 'enough', 'going', 'earn', 'critical', 'commercial', 'success', 'spawning', 'sequel', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'II', '2003', 'broke', 'Labor', 'Day', 'box', 'office', 'records', 'year', 'Written', 'directed', 'controversial', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'chilling', 'horror', 'film', 'Clownhouse', '1988', 'Powder', '1995', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'life', 'death', 'new', 'figure', 'Hollywood', 'creature', 'pantheon', 'Creeper', 'demonic', 'looking', 'figure', '23', 'years', 'feeds', '23', 'days', 'according', 'legend.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Gina', 'Phillips', 'Trish', 'Justin', 'Long', 'brother', 'Derry', 'traveling', 'together', 'car', 'lonely', 'desolate', 'country', 'highway', 'way', 'home', 'college', 'scary', 'incident', 'old', 'truck', 'two', 'witness', 'sinister', 'cloaked', 'figure', 'unceremoniously', 'dumping', 'what', 'body', 'sized', 'parcels', 'wrapped', 'cloth', 'rope', 'down', 'large', 'corrugated', 'metal', 'pipe', 'boarded', 'up', 'church', 'Also', 'parked', 'nearby', 'same', 'truck', 'nearly', 'ran', 'off', 'road', 'earlier', 'Once', 'old', 'church', 'two', 'begin', 'question', 'what', 'exactly', 'saw', 'are', 'soon', 'joined', 'again', 'mysterious', 'truck', 'more', 'intent', 'ever', 'now', 'ram', 'car', 'drive', 'off', 'road', 'losing', 'truck', 'two', 'go', 'back', 'church', 'Trish', 'protests', 'investigate', 'Derry', 'proceeds', 'do', 'something', 'stupid', 'see', 'something', 'human', 'was', 'mean', 'see', 'oh', 'did', 'confirm', 'what', 'originally', 'thought', 'figure', 'was', 'indeed', 'dumping', 'bodies', 'down', 'large', 'drain', 'just', 'tip', 'proverbial', 'iceberg', 'What', 'other', 'secrets', 'are', 'uncovered', 'What', 'nature', 'creature', 'Do', 'Trish', 'Derry', 'survive', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'help', 'thought', 'makeup', 'such', 'Creeper', 'looked', 'quite', 'good', 'suitably', 'malevolent', 'revelations', 'revealed', 'character', 'came', 'nice', 'even', 'clip', 'plot', 'unfolded', 'were', 'number', 'minor', 'points', 'where', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'plot', 'weak', 'very', 'thin', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'disagreeing', 'especially', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'focused', 'something', 'foreground', 'provided', 'enough', 'leeway', 'screen', 'see', 'something', 'background', 'even', 'was', 'fuzzy', 'focus', 'characters', 'screen', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Cheap', 'scares', 'are', 'had', 'here', 'things', 'pop', 'out', 'go', 'boo', 'also', 'nice', 'build', 'real', 'tension', 'film', 'smattering', 'comedy', 'usually', 'sarcastic', 'kind', 'temper', 'horror', 'weakness', 'film', 'predictability', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'original', 'beginning', 'had', 'brought', 'forth', 'high', 'hopes', 'hopes', 'diminished', 'slightly', 'film', 'eventually', 'tread', 'path', 'repetition', 'most', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'least', 'one', 'did', 'so', 'style', 'professionalism', 'most', 'uncommon', 'same', 'genre', 'may', 'recognize', 'Justin', 'Long', 'TV', 'Ed', 'were', 'Warren', 'Parker', 'Cheswick', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'affable', 'character', 'played', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'older', 'little', 'more', 'cynical', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'quite', 'lovely', 'flowing', 'brownish', 'hair', 'doe', 'eyed', 'appearance', 'more', 'cynical', 'brother', 'attitude', 'actors', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'showing', 'mixture', 'inherent', 'hard', 'earned', 'talent', 'kind', 'gained', 'lots', 'work', 'dedication.The', 'picture', 'here', 'available', 'wide', 'screen', 'full', 'screen', 'wonderful', 'crisp', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'photo', 'gallery', 'deleted', 'extended', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'featurettes', 'six', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'Many', 'features', 'are', 'located', 'flip', 'side', 'disc', 'film', 'being', 'other', 'side', 'guess', 'one', 'thing', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'see', 'darkened', 'figure', 'dumping', 'what', 'be', 'bodies', 'down', 'sewer', 'pipe', 'abandoned', 'church', 'just', 'keep', 'moving', 'can', 'make', 'report', 'next', 'town', 'sure', 'avoid', 'actually', 'crawling', 'pipe', 'confirm', 'what', 'already', 'know.Cookieman108']",Jeepers Creepers

This movie could have been so good.  It started out calm and mellow then BAMM out of no where loud noisy car screchs, screams, and jumpable footage.  But after I learned that our main characted, WHO IS A GUY, has a Rose tatooed around his belly button, CAN WE GET ANY LAMMER!?, I began to loose faith.  The creature was rather cool in the begining.  We don't see it until the middle of the movie.  This is the Technique that was so perfectly used by Ridley Scott in Alien. THAT IS A TRUE MODERN HORROR FILM!  Then when we finaly see the monster we see a lot of familurarities of past horror creatures.  Classic Bat wings, a grey, leathery body.  Then it does something.  It what, Makes a really loud obnoctious noise and then these Spices pop off it's face and create this webbed hat thing that looks like and inverted Tricerotops's frill.  And in the end.  Our main Character so creativly named Jilly or something like that I FOUND THIS FITTIN BECAUSE HE HAS A GIRL'S NAME AND A ROSE TATOOED ON HIS STOMACH Get's offed and all we see is his face which still has perfect for except for the fact that his eyes are missing and our creature stands up behind him and it's eyes meet perfectly with Jilly's and we see his bright brand new eyes he just ate.  BTW.  He has to eat the body part in order for it to replace his.  Plot wasn't all to bad but this movie could have been so much better than what it was.

I found The Creeper much more effective early in the movie when it was just him in his hat and rags, driving his truck. Once he was fully revealed he lost a lot of his menace. The psychic angle was okay to get some back-story into the movie, however she kept telling the kids &quot;you don't understand,&quot; but refused to explain. You're right, I don't understand - and while I may fear what I don't understand in other circumstances, here I just got annoyed.So much of the movie is a mixture of other films that I got frustrated trying to follow it toward the end. Think of it as Duel meets The Birds meets Urban Legend meets The Hitcher meets Silence of the Lambs meets Mimic meets who-knows-what-else.The movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered, such as: &quot;What is The Creeper?&quot; &quot;Where did it come from?&quot; &quot;Why is Trish willing to sacrifice herself for Darry? (Does it have anything to do with Mr. Poly-Sci-Track-Team Guy?)&quot; and &quot;Are Jezelle's dreams ever wrong?&quot;The movie does have some redeeming qualities, though. The actors do a good job with their roles; Eileen Brennan gives a delightfully off-center performance as The Cat Lady. The music is effective. There are some good gross-out moments and some good suspense.

I had never seen it before and I must admit I was surprised that a post-2000 movie could deliver such chills.The most chilling moments were in the first half of the film.  Our two main characters, a brother and sister driving home from spring break along a desolate stretch of country roads somewhere in central Florida, are chased off the road by a maniac in a horrible old truck.  Seemingly a salute to ""Duel"", the director here really outdid Steven Spielberg in casting the ugliest, most horrifying old truck in existence!  If all we ever see in this movie is the truck it would be scary enough!  They later pass an abandoned old church along the roadside where the same old truck is parked and see the driver tossing what looks like wrapped bodies down an old pipe.  The art of the filmmaker is exquisite here.  The driver, clad in a long tattered overcoat and hat, turns and stares at them as they pass.  The scene takes place in broad daylight and yet is one of the most chilling and creepy movie moments I have ever seen.  He gets back in the truck and pursues the teenagers and the story goes on from there.Only the southern values of the kids could dictate going back to help someone they believe is in trouble, and our characters do just that.  What they discover in the basement of the old church is more frightening than they had first suspected.  The movie loses some momentum from this point on.The actors give good, competent performances and the location shooting in rural Florida lends a frightening sense of isolation.  Eileen Brennan is good as the crazy old backwoods cat lady.  It is an entertaining movie I don't regret owning.  Victor Salva is a talented campfire storyteller and this movie will probably be his masterpiece.

You may find some of the elements from this film elsewhere, but Jeepers Creepers really does have its own unique story to tell.  The plot breaks down a little bit in the final half hour, but everything up to that point is simply superb.I love the opening scenes; this really doesn't even seem like a movie for the first half hour.  You have a very typical brother and sister cruising down a deserted road in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the day.  I entered this film with dark aspirations in mind, so the bright, peaceful setting of the opening really grabbed my attention.  It may be a lonely stretch of road, but the setting is one of safety and serenity - until, that is, a character in a super-charged old van tries to wreck the car holding our protagonists.  For Patricia and Darius Jenner (Gina Philips and Justin Long, respectively), this frightening bit of road rage proves to be only the start of a horrible night.  On down the road, the pair catch sight of the evil van parked beside an old, crumbling building; looking closer, they see the driver of the truck tossing a couple of items that certainly look like bodies wrapped in blood-soaked sheets down a big pipe.  The bad guy sees the kids pass by and immediately starts out in pursuit, doing all he can to wreck them.  Darius eventually has the brilliant idea of going back to the pipe to see if anyone is still alive down there, and his much smarter sister cannot talk him out of this notion.  Here marks the upping of the creepiness factor.  There are many significant things to be found in the chamber below; finding a way out, though proves to be a challenge as Darius soon discovers.  Eventually a shell-shocked Darius and Trish make it to a roadside restaurant and call the police.  Things get weirder, though, when an anonymous stranger calls Darius and Trish and explains the things she has been seeing in her visions, warning them that the &quot;thing&quot; will not stop coming after them.  This proves to be quite the understatement.  The Creeper, whoever or whatever he is, is relentless in his pursuit of the scared youngsters, leading to one exciting confrontation after another in a variety of venues.  Things progress quite nicely to an ending that is both good and bad; good in the sense that it does not pull a fairy tale ending out of the hat, but bad in that the final five minutes prove anticlimactic, forced, and generally unsatisfying.Personally, I have to say I wasn't that impressed with the costume and special effects of the Creeper; from a distance, or coiled in shadows, he's pretty intimidating, but his visual effect on the viewer decreases as we see more of him.  Writer/director Victor Salva envisioned this film as his own &quot;monster movie,&quot; but I think that a more human boogeyman would have served this story more effectively.  Justin Long has some kind of David Schwimmer thing going on at times, but he is otherwise quite convincing in the role of Darius; he is the one who sees firsthand the handiwork of the Creeper, and the effects of what he has seen are reflected dramatically on his face and spirit.  Gina Philips is fantastic; she may well be the sexiest female on the planet, as well.  More than just a pretty face, the depth of her commitment and talent are demonstrated quite convincingly in the six featurettes on the making of the movie.  These featurettes, by the way, are quite good.  The deleted and extended scenes housed on the DVD, though, aren't that impressive; for the life of me, I could hardly find the difference between the alternate and final versions of a few scenes in the movie.Jeepers Creepers is just a terrific, vastly underrated horror film.  Relying more on suspense than blood and gore (although there is a certain amount of gore to be found here), this would make an especially good introduction to the genre for those yet to dip their feet into the deep, dark side of the entertainment pool.",5,One of the creepiest horror films of recent years,1065225600,"10 4, 2003",2003,4089,"['Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'fresh', 'creepy', 'horror', 'films', 'come', 'along', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'may', 'find', 'elements', 'film', 'elsewhere', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'really', 'have', 'own', 'unique', 'story', 'tell', 'plot', 'down', 'little', 'bit', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'everything', 'up', 'point', 'simply', 'superb.I', 'opening', 'scenes', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'movie', 'first', 'hour', 'have', 'very', 'typical', 'brother', 'sister', 'cruising', 'down', 'deserted', 'road', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'middle', 'day', 'entered', 'film', 'dark', 'aspirations', 'mind', 'bright', 'peaceful', 'setting', 'opening', 'really', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'may', 'be', 'lonely', 'stretch', 'road', 'setting', 'one', 'safety', 'serenity', 'character', 'super-charged', 'old', 'van', 'wreck', 'car', 'holding', 'protagonists', 'Patricia', 'Darius', 'Jenner', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'Justin', 'Long', 'respectively', 'frightening', 'bit', 'road', 'rage', 'be', 'only', 'start', 'horrible', 'night', 'road', 'pair', 'catch', 'sight', 'evil', 'van', 'parked', 'old', 'crumbling', 'building', 'looking', 'closer', 'see', 'driver', 'truck', 'tossing', 'couple', 'items', 'certainly', 'look', 'bodies', 'wrapped', 'blood-soaked', 'sheets', 'down', 'big', 'pipe', 'bad', 'guy', 'kids', 'pass', 'immediately', 'out', 'pursuit', 'doing', 'can', 'wreck', 'Darius', 'eventually', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'going', 'back', 'pipe', 'see', 'anyone', 'still', 'alive', 'there', 'much', 'smarter', 'sister', 'can', 'not', 'talk', 'out', 'notion', 'Here', 'upping', 'creepiness', 'factor', 'are', 'many', 'significant', 'things', 'be', 'found', 'chamber', 'finding', 'way', 'out', 'though', 'be', 'challenge', 'Darius', 'soon', 'discovers', 'Eventually', 'shell-shocked', 'Darius', 'Trish', 'make', 'roadside', 'restaurant', 'call', 'police', 'Things', 'get', 'weirder', 'though', 'when', 'anonymous', 'stranger', 'Darius', 'Trish', 'things', 'been', 'seeing', 'visions', 'warning', 'quot', 'thing', 'quot', 'will', 'not', 'stop', 'coming', 'be', 'quite', 'understatement', 'Creeper', 'whoever', 'whatever', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'scared', 'youngsters', 'leading', 'one', 'exciting', 'confrontation', 'variety', 'venues', 'Things', 'quite', 'nicely', 'ending', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'sense', 'not', 'pull', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ending', 'hat', 'bad', 'final', 'five', 'minutes', 'prove', 'anticlimactic', 'forced', 'generally', 'unsatisfying.Personally', 'have', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'costume', 'special', 'effects', 'Creeper', 'distance', 'coiled', 'shadows', 'pretty', 'intimidating', 'visual', 'effect', 'viewer', 'see', 'more', 'Writer/director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'envisioned', 'film', 'own', 'quot', 'monster', 'movie', 'quot', 'think', 'more', 'human', 'boogeyman', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'story', 'more', 'effectively', 'Justin', 'Long', 'kind', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'thing', 'going', 'times', 'otherwise', 'quite', 'convincing', 'role', 'Darius', 'one', 'who', 'firsthand', 'handiwork', 'Creeper', 'effects', 'what', 'seen', 'are', 'reflected', 'dramatically', 'face', 'spirit', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'fantastic', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'sexiest', 'female', 'planet', 'as', 'well', 'More', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'depth', 'commitment', 'talent', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'six', 'featurettes', 'making', 'movie', 'featurettes', 'way', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'housed', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'life', 'could', 'hardly', 'find', 'difference', 'alternate', 'final', 'versions', 'few', 'scenes', 'movie.Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'just', 'terrific', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'horror', 'film', 'Relying', 'more', 'suspense', 'blood', 'gore', 'certain', 'amount', 'gore', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'would', 'make', 'especially', 'good', 'introduction', 'genre', 'yet', 'dip', 'feet', 'deep', 'dark', 'side', 'entertainment', 'pool']",Jeepers Creepers

Go on a road trip: look at all those lonely diners marooned along vast, forsaken strips of blacktop. Take one of those empty little roads to nowhere, three turns away from the Interstate: go bumpity-bump down a dusty trail to a gas-n'-go that closes shop on Sunday because---well, there's just no business in these parts on Sunday, Old Hoss.Flip the radio on right about now: chances are you're going to get a load of Jesus. Come to the Lord! Hell awaits! Satan stalking the Earth, hungry as a lion, seeking those who He can devour, Hallelujah!Thousands of Americans disappear every year, in our great interconnected Republic: it's true, many run away, change their names, disappear, start new lives.But it's also true, I think, that many of them set out on road trips, and get eaten alive.So you're Darius and Trish, and you have the worst timing ever. Because, see, on this particular stretch of blacktop, you've got this Thing. A Troll, let's say: an Ogre, the Boogeyman, a Monster. Every twenty-three years it awakens: for 23 days, it gets to Eat. And by Jesus, it sure is hungry!Timing is everything.Now: director Victor Salva is a real sicky: I'm going to avoid into the man's history of pedophilia---though I do think his peculiar obsessions very much inform his deeply personal vision of horror, and---at least from a cinematic standpoint---in a good way.

The only question is why Justin went on to have an ongoing successful career in moviemaking when the incredibly gorgeous young lady that played his sister hasn't been seen by me anyway since I saw this movie. She is certainly a good actress and is one of those heart stoppingly gorgeous women that a person sees about once a month if they both get out a lot and are lucky. Man, ""hot"" doesn't quite cover the lass as a description. She would literally take the air out of a room full of men when she entered.......oh well.Great movie full of just about everything wants in a typical horror movie. Evil, eteranal shape-shifting monster with his own dungeoun covered in his years worth of victims bodies. A spooky psychic black lady that sees all and knows all but who of course is ignored by everyone and........well, to go any further would ruin the movie.If anyone knows where I can find a poster of the actress that plays the sister role in this movie, let me know. If anyone knows of her appearing in anything else besides this movie, let me know that as well!I highly recommend at LEAST renting this movie. Purchasing a used copy from one of Amazons many vendors might be a good idea as it is worthy of an additional viewing from time to time and the small businesses that depend on Amazon for a large portion of their income could use the very few dollars this movie would cost.I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys the horror genre.

I really liked Justin Long and Gina Philips, they do a very &quot;believable&quot; job as bickering brother and sister. This is the first film by Victor Salva that I have seen and I think he did a very good job at directing &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;, and the way he used &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; by Paul Whiteman and his Swing Wing is very creepy. &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; has all the ingredients of a horror film, it has a creepy score, people make life-threateningmistakes, and most of all, it has good-old-fashioned scares. I don't get why people don't like this film, I mean people have that right, but I don't understand why they didn't like it. Like for example, the reviewer (I won't any names) who wanted to know what the point of the film was, films don't usually have a point, all they are are tools we use to escape from reality, to get away from all the troubles of the world and in the case of horror movies, it's so we can get a few scares and then go back to life. He also wanted to know why they showed the bodies sewn together? I think they did it to show what the creeper's hobies may have been, even if it was as sick as sewing dead bodies together.&quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; is good for a few scares, and (in my opinion) the best film of the year so far.

I saw the previews for it and it looked good, so we rented it as soon as it came out.

I digress.  Water under the bridge.Dari and Trish are on their way home from college.  Of course, they are taking the long, out-of-the-way road where two people went missing over twenty years ago.  They are nearly run off the road by a beat-up, menacing truck that seems to have a life of its own.  Later, they see the occupant of the truck dumping something (a body?) into a large pipe.  He turns and watches them drive past.  This is the best shot in the movie!  This time they do get run off the road and Dari wants to go back and see what's in the pipe (idiot).  At the bottom Dari finds something disturbing (I'm sure you can guess), so they high tail it out of there to the nearest diner.  Dari gets a call from a psychic who tells him to watch out for the song Jeepers Creepers, `cause that's when HE'LL come.We then get into the best horror sequence of 2001.  Someone notices the Creeper going through Dari's things out in the car.  Dari and Trish offer to take the police to the secret pipe but the Creeper attacks during and awful rock version of Jeepers Creepers (I'm sure you can guess what happens to the police escort).  It's the second best shot in the film!  Dari and Trish escape to Eileen Brennan's farm and shoot it out with the Creeper.  ""That ain't my scarecrow!"" .  Pretty cool sequence.From there it's off to the police station and a big battle between the local P.D. and the Creeper.  I won't reveal the ending, but I will say it just seems like they cut out the entire third act.  It just ends.Jeepers Creepers got a lot of negative reviews when it was released.  I can guess why.  Most critics don't know how to review a horror film.  It doesn't conform to the other rules of cinema.  All you have to do is tell a scary story and this one works more often than it doesn't.  The problem I have with it is; when it doesn't work, it REALLY doesn't work.  The Miss Cleo character is the most striking example.  She's put there to reveal necessary information to save Dari's and Trish's lives, but at a critical moment she refuses to help them because they might have a negative reaction to her information.  Huh?  Dari's reason for going down the pipe isn't really that good either.  Salva scripted and would do well to let a better screenwriter handle the reigns of Jeepers Creepers 2.  Yes, it's coming.The DVD offers just about everything you could want.  Commentary.  Deleted Scenes.  Making ofs.On the whole this is a pretty good horror movie.  Reminiscent of Dean Koontz's Phantoms or Jason Goes to Hell.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","A far better than average teen horror flick, largely due to the use of eerie, X FILES influenced, Hitchcock-like photography, JEEPERS CREEPERS is the perfect Halloween movie ... except for, of course, HALLOWEEN.Two college students, brother and sister, are driving home from school on break, when the happen to pass by an old church where they believe they see a cloaked figure dropping bodies down a well.  Before you can say &quot;book us a sequel,&quot; the figure gives pursuit ... and, sadly, the two students are behaving like other students plunked down into the absurd circumstances of the typical horror film.Subplots are dangled here, hinting at what an exception to the teen genre JEEPERS could have been, but they're left unexplored.  &quot;Things just aren't the same at home because mom sounds ... I don't know ... unhappy.&quot;  &quot;Sis, what's up with that boyfriend of yours back at school?&quot;  Also, why is it that the residents of the county have never reported seeing the butchering maniac driving around in a truck that stands out more than a scratched frame on a STAR WARS film?  The main plotline -- is it a psychopathic killer preying upon innocent victims or is it some creature of the undead? -- is never sacrificed along the way; had JEEPERS elected to explore some of these other themes, it certainly would've elevated the story-telling to a height rarely reached in modern horror films.However, the screenwriter/director (Victor Salva) makes one very intelligent decision: he sneaks in a plot point which makes a sequel almost impossible.  Unlike other creatures, this one only feasts every 23 years (exactly why, we're never told). I say 'almost' b/c the studio recently announced plans to produce a follow-up.While JEEPERS employs many of the conventions of horror films that makes them largely predictable, mostly incredulous, and inherently flawed, the flick also manages not to take itself too seriously, throwing in a few chuckles at the genre but not at the expense of the experience.",4,Heebie Jeebies!,1019433600,"04 22, 2002",2002,2026,"['far', 'better', 'average', 'teen', 'horror', 'flick', 'largely', 'due', 'use', 'eerie', 'X', 'FILES', 'influenced', 'Hitchcock-like', 'photography', 'JEEPERS', 'CREEPERS', 'perfect', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'course', 'HALLOWEEN.Two', 'college', 'students', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'driving', 'home', 'school', 'break', 'when', 'happen', 'pass', 'old', 'church', 'where', 'believe', 'see', 'cloaked', 'figure', 'dropping', 'bodies', 'down', 'well', 'can', 'say', 'quot', 'book', 'sequel', 'quot', 'figure', 'pursuit', 'sadly', 'two', 'students', 'are', 'behaving', 'other', 'students', 'plunked', 'down', 'absurd', 'circumstances', 'typical', 'horror', 'film.Subplots', 'are', 'dangled', 'here', 'hinting', 'what', 'exception', 'teen', 'genre', 'JEEPERS', 'could', 'have', 'been', ""'re"", 'left', 'unexplored', 'quot', 'Things', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'same', 'home', 'mom', 'sounds', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'unhappy.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sis', 'what', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'yours', 'back', 'school', 'quot', 'Also', 'why', 'residents', 'county', 'have', 'never', 'reported', 'seeing', 'butchering', 'maniac', 'driving', 'around', 'truck', 'out', 'more', 'scratched', 'frame', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'film', 'main', 'plotline', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'preying', 'innocent', 'victims', 'creature', 'undead', 'never', 'sacrificed', 'way', 'had', 'JEEPERS', 'elected', 'explore', 'other', 'themes', 'certainly', 'would', ""'ve"", 'elevated', 'story-telling', 'height', 'rarely', 'reached', 'modern', 'horror', 'films.However', 'screenwriter/director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'one', 'very', 'intelligent', 'decision', 'plot', 'point', 'sequel', 'almost', 'impossible', 'other', 'creatures', 'one', 'only', '23', 'years', 'exactly', 'why', ""'re"", 'never', 'told', 'say', 'studio', 'recently', 'announced', 'plans', 'produce', 'follow-up.While', 'JEEPERS', 'many', 'conventions', 'horror', 'films', 'largely', 'predictable', 'mostly', 'incredulous', 'inherently', 'flawed', 'flick', 'also', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'throwing', 'few', 'chuckles', 'genre', 'not', 'expense', 'experience']",Jeepers Creepers

It successfully captured the spookiness one feels while driving down a deserted highway.  It also successfully spooked me out when the siblings are chased down by a car, when they see a hooded man dump human-size wrapped sacks down a pipe and also by what Justin Long sees when he goes down that pipe.  I thought Long did a credible job acting terrified.However, this is also one of those movies where the victims make really stupid decisions.  For example, after getting chased down by the vehicle, the brother yells out the window to insult the guy.  But who would be foolish enough to provoke a psychopath?Even more foolish than that was him going down the pipe at all.  Who would be foolish enough to go down a pipe after just witnessing dead bodies getting dumped into it?  He gives a reason, but most sane people would go straight to the police instead.  I think the writer must've suspected viewers would have this reaction because the sister tells her brother not to act like one of those stupid people in horror films...and yet, they still act like them anyway.Shorlty after that scene, after seeing the monster attack someone in their car, the sister walks up to the car to investigate.  And when they see the creature, they don't immediately run, but instead just stand there as he eats someone.  Again, what?These foolish decisions pulled me out of my initial scared reaction, but so, too, did the scenes with the psychic as well as having the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" accompany a kill.  I understand the intent of the cheerful music was to make a kill seem more disturbing, but the intent was so obvious it didn't work for me.

Most of the &quot;horror&quot; movies of the last 20 years or so have been the teen slasher films, which turned into the jokes of the scream series.  John Carpenter had the masterpiece in Halloween, but I would classify what he's done since as more science fiction.  And then there are the psycological thrillers, like &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, which have their moments but hold back on the gore.&quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; has it all.  There is no holding back on the gore.  When the creature starts eating a victim's tongue, while still attached to the head, it doesn't get any better than that.  We get close-ups of victim's stiched-up bodies.  And the final scene would make Buffalo Bill proud.Where it excels, though, is atmosphere and tension.  I remember that the plot of &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; was not that great, but the setting of the house in that movie was as creepy as it got.  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; goes beyond this.  We see that something awful is probably at the monster's hangout.  We spend time debating whether to enter it's confines.  When we finally get to see it, the buildup pays off big-time.  It would be hard to design a scarier environment than what Justin Long falls into.The only reason that I don't give it five stars is explained in the movie itself.  Most people, after seeing the setup, would high-tail it out as fast as possible, and let the authorities take over.

Valero ""Eterno""","[2, 2]","Two Siblings returning home from college witness a man throwing bodies down a drainage pipe at the back of an old church and in an act of absolute stupidity, they decide to investigate. They discover hundreds of perfectly preserved bodies all stitched up and artistically spread out throughout the dusty, dark cellar. Their nosiness fuels the wrath of the killer who isn't a man at all but some sort of monstrous, murderous demon who has risen from the depths of the earth to feed on human flesh.I must frankly state that it was very difficult for me to feel sorry for the two main charaters. Although they were both youthful, attractive and very likable, it was their foolishness that got them in trouble in the first place. I am no expert in profiling but the film still begs me to ask the question: What part of the man's appearance had they not mistaken for a vicious killer? He was only about 10 feet tall, was wearing a freakish, dusty, moth worn hat, a Jack The Ripper-ish over coat and was clearly dumping bodies (most likely dead bodies) into a drainage pipe. And let's not forget his mode of transportation and really bad driving skills.""Jeepers Creepers"" is still one of the most innovative horror film in a long time. It has some good performances and a very mysterious killer.  Although the film follows the typical slasher movie formula, it rises above them due to it's enigmatic and supernatural storyline. Also, the origins of the killer is never really explained and the killer's face is not clearly shown until the final frames all adding a sense of mystery, intrigue and fear. Add in some scenes of explicit gore, slaughter, and a  surprise ending and you have an enjoyable, eerie tale of human idiocy, bloodshed and tears.

679341,A23FPOXQ6HIN4J,B00005RHGK,Evan Harris,"[2, 5]","Lets pretend for a second that it's perfectly normal to write two reviews based on one movie:Heres the firstJeepers Creepers is one of the most painstakngly tension filled and nerve fraying experiences ive had watching a movie in a long time.And now the second:Jeepers Creepers is a steaming pile of crap whose biggest asparation is to be ranked among other tepid monster/slasher(is that redundant) flicks that should be lucky to get more than one pass but who somehow will inevitably land a sequal.Why two reviews? Because it is two movies ad just for that reason is one of the most frustrating experiences Ive had watching anything.The basic plot is this:A brother and sister on a cross country trip happen upon a site covered(literally) with bodies and find themselves stalked by what seems to be the man responsible.he turns out to be something completly different. This unfortunatly, is the exact place the movie turns into something completly different too. In the first half, the movie builds slowly, the siblings relatonship is portrayed realistically as they are shown bickering about just about everything but through it all show genuine care for each other. The tension starts to build when thy come upon the lair of the creature. Of course at this point they have no way of knowing this terrifying spectacle is not man-made. Inside they find bodies lining the walls, looking eerily laminated. Then they are discovered and a car chase begins as they are being followed by a faceless man driving a black pickup truckin in a sequence that plays out alot like the classic movie Duel. All this works terrifically with mounting tension and shock after shock. I genuinly felt and was afraid for the characters. At this point I was so excited to see how this thing worked itself out I couldnt stand it. i also couldnt stand what the movie descended into after that.Any horror movie that plays on the type of fears the first half of this movie does should know that not only is less more, but that oftentimes the unknown is more terrifying than anything a movie can produce. Especially if after all that buildup, the reveal turns out to be Bat-boy. After that great beginning, the movie disintegrates into schlock jump scare horror with no sense of fun and having answered the question of what the stranger is, the only thing that gave me a case of the willies was realizing it wasnt going to get any better. I did appreciate the ending, at least they had the cajones to end the movie in a way i wasn't expecting, if thy had just had the cajones to give a second half that could live up to the first.",2,"Jeepers Creepers,the hell?",1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,2603,"['Lets', 'pretend', 'second', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'write', 'two', 'reviews', 'based', 'one', 'movie', 'firstJeepers', 'Creepers', 'one', 'most', 'painstakngly', 'tension', 'filled', 'nerve', 'fraying', 'experiences', 'ive', 'had', 'watching', 'movie', 'long', 'time.And', 'now', 'second', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'steaming', 'pile', 'crap', 'biggest', 'asparation', 'be', 'ranked', 'other', 'tepid', 'monster/slasher', 'redundant', 'should', 'be', 'lucky', 'get', 'more', 'one', 'pass', 'who', 'somehow', 'will', 'inevitably', 'land', 'sequal.Why', 'two', 'reviews', 'two', 'movies', 'ad', 'just', 'reason', 'one', 'most', 'frustrating', 'experiences', 'Ive', 'had', 'watching', 'anything.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'brother', 'sister', 'cross', 'country', 'trip', 'happen', 'site', 'covered', 'literally', 'bodies', 'find', 'stalked', 'what', 'be', 'man', 'responsible.he', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'completly', 'different', 'unfortunatly', 'exact', 'place', 'movie', 'something', 'completly', 'different', 'too', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'slowly', 'siblings', 'relatonship', 'portrayed', 'realistically', 'are', 'shown', 'bickering', 'about', 'just', 'everything', 'show', 'genuine', 'care', 'other', 'tension', 'build', 'when', 'thy', 'come', 'lair', 'creature', 'course', 'point', 'have', 'way', 'knowing', 'terrifying', 'spectacle', 'not', 'man-made', 'find', 'bodies', 'lining', 'walls', 'looking', 'eerily', 'laminated', 'Then', 'are', 'discovered', 'car', 'chase', 'are', 'being', 'followed', 'faceless', 'man', 'driving', 'black', 'pickup', 'truckin', 'sequence', 'out', 'alot', 'classic', 'movie', 'Duel', 'terrifically', 'mounting', 'tension', 'shock', 'shock', 'genuinly', 'felt', 'was', 'afraid', 'characters', 'point', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'how', 'thing', 'worked', 'out', 'couldnt', 'stand', 'i', 'also', 'couldnt', 'stand', 'what', 'movie', 'descended', 'that.Any', 'horror', 'movie', 'type', 'fears', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'should', 'know', 'not', 'only', 'less', 'more', 'unknown', 'more', 'terrifying', 'anything', 'movie', 'can', 'produce', 'Especially', 'buildup', 'reveal', 'out', 'be', 'Bat-boy', 'great', 'beginning', 'movie', 'schlock', 'jump', 'scare', 'horror', 'sense', 'fun', 'having', 'answered', 'question', 'what', 'stranger', 'only', 'thing', 'gave', 'case', 'willies', 'was', 'realizing', 'going', 'get', 'better', 'did', 'appreciate', 'ending', 'least', 'had', 'cajones', 'end', 'movie', 'way', 'i', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'thy', 'had', 'just', 'had', 'cajones', 'give', 'second', 'half', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'first']",Jeepers Creepers

The sister says something to her brother about how there is a point in all horror movies where someone does something stupid, and that's what he was doing.  Would have been funny in Scream, but not here where they weren't trying to be a spoof.  The scenes in the church basement were disturbing enough to be scary, but then the movie turned into a really, really bad made-for-tv movie.You never really care about the main characters in the movie.  You never really care about the monster, or how or why he exists.  One line in the entire movie tries to explain The Creeper.  One line?  To explain a flesh eating monster who can't be stopped?  Um, alright.The performances were terrible.I am a fan (not a big fan, but a fan) of the horror movie genre.  What makes them fun is being scared, being grossed out, and believing (if even slightly) in what is going on in the film.  You get none of the above in this one in the second half.

The movie tells the story of a brother and sister driving through the farmlands when they encounter a road rage maniac who is later witnessed dumping a body into a drainage pipe.  From that point on, its a chase to the end.  This movie is full of frights as well as characters you care about.  From the scene at the church to the ending at the police station, it keeps you glued to the screen.  Of course, there is the typical horror movie mistakes all characters make such as going back to investigate the body but hey, this is horror.  People in horror films do crazy stuff like that.

The stop-start nature of the action coupled with a plot revolving around a foregone conclusion prevents a head of steam from truly building, but yields other quirky rewards especially in the mordant humour. The background of the director gives this occasionally terrifying film a nasty edge that makes me feel guilty for liking it.The original ending is included as an extra, and is to my mind subtler and more terrifying than the more explicit ending we eventually arrived at.

679350,A1L3E4ZLRNKFNP,B00005RHGK,Gary,"[1, 1]","It's been a long while since a horror movie has came anywhere close to those back in the eighties. While Jeepers Creepers doesn't exactly remind you of those campy horror films from over a decade ago, it's a breath of fresh air and different than the recent &quot;teen horror&quot; slasher films we've seen in the past few years. And I must say, it's about time.While driving home for college break, a brother and sister are tailgated by a psycho in a huge green truck. Later on, they come across the same truck parked beside an old abandoned church. They both see a mysterious figure dumping what seems to be several body bags down an old sewer pipe. A few moments later, the brother wants to go back to investigate, but the hesitant sister thinks it would be absolutely absurd to go back. After talking it over, and realizing that they could possibly save someone's life if they happened to be still alive, they decide to go back.What they then find is something horrendus. Soon they find out, that this madman knows that they've found his burial place. And it will stop at nothing to get what it wants. The thing itself, isn't even human. It's something far more evil and demonic. It's a monster. A monster that looks like a cross between Freddy Kreguer gone bad and the Lephrechaun.While the movie does fit some stereotypical cliches, what horror film doesn't? At least it's not another masked human figure stalking a bunch of helpless teens with an absurd motive. While the motive for this creature in Jeepers Creepers is mentioned, far more of it is left to the mind and remains mysterious. The acting in the film is quite good. The film itself isn't really scary, but it is very creepy and there's plenty of gore for everyone. I think horror fans should give this a try. Even if you don't like it, it's sure to be a change from the recent horror films you've seen.",4,"Finally, Something Different",1001116800,"09 22, 2001",2001,1871,"['been', 'long', 'while', 'horror', 'movie', 'came', 'anywhere', 'close', 'back', 'eighties', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'remind', 'campy', 'horror', 'films', 'decade', 'ago', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'different', 'recent', 'quot', 'teen', 'horror', 'quot', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'must', 'say', 'time.While', 'driving', 'home', 'college', 'break', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'tailgated', 'psycho', 'huge', 'green', 'truck', 'Later', 'come', 'same', 'truck', 'parked', 'old', 'abandoned', 'church', 'see', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'dumping', 'what', 'be', 'several', 'body', 'bags', 'down', 'old', 'sewer', 'pipe', 'few', 'moments', 'later', 'brother', 'go', 'back', 'investigate', 'hesitant', 'sister', 'would', 'be', 'absolutely', 'absurd', 'go', 'back', 'talking', 'realizing', 'could', 'possibly', 'save', 'someone', 'life', 'happened', 'be', 'still', 'alive', 'decide', 'go', 'then', 'find', 'something', 'horrendus', 'Soon', 'find', 'out', 'madman', ""'ve"", 'found', 'burial', 'place', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'what', 'thing', ""n't"", 'even', 'human', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'evil', 'demonic', 'monster', 'monster', 'cross', 'Freddy', 'Kreguer', 'gone', 'bad', 'Lephrechaun.While', 'movie', 'fit', 'stereotypical', 'cliches', 'what', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'least', 'not', 'masked', 'human', 'figure', 'stalking', 'bunch', 'helpless', 'teens', 'absurd', 'motive', 'motive', 'creature', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'mentioned', 'far', 'more', 'left', 'mind', 'mysterious', 'acting', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'scary', 'very', 'creepy', 'plenty', 'gore', 'everyone', 'think', 'horror', 'fans', 'should', 'give', 'try', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'sure', 'be', 'change', 'recent', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen']",Jeepers Creepers

679353,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B00005RHGK,Get What We Give,"[3, 3]","I suppose that a lot of people going to the movies today have grown up on such tripe as Scary Movie, the Friday the 13th series and other crappy horror films.  I suppose these same people expect that every little detail of a film must be explained on an adolescent's level, so as not to confuse them while they watch the films with their eyes as their mouths cannot keep from running while in the theatre.  It's a funny thing - sound when added to a film allowed for certain nuances of the theatre to be present, so that the visual didn't have to do all the work.  So to those who would call this film bad, I say:  turn off your cell phone, stop talking to your buddies, and pay attention to the movie.Jeepers Creepers isn't the finest horror film ever made, but it certainly is one that can scare the bejesus out of you.  Certainly there are very standard plot devices in action here - but isn't that part of the formula for a horror film?  ...Jeepers starts off using bits and pieces of known scare tactics and then milks them with a wink and a nudge.  Should the lead characters go back and see whats up at that creepy looking house where the even creepier looking guy was ....?  Of course not!  The characters even acknowledge this fact.  However, pulled by the same force that requires everyone passing an accident to rubberneck, they do.  (And let's face it - if they didn't - the movie wouldn't have been made).At once scary, silly, laughable, and immensely frustrating, Jeepers Creepers shows us a new (albeit traditional and truly old hat) villain: a monster! .Just what this monster wants is never fully explained as the film truly frustrates us by setting itself up for an obvious sequel (which I truly hope gets made).The film features fine actors performing honestly and well.  Eileen Brennan appears in an extended cameo that is quite unforgettable.  The script is good, the cinematography is quite well done.When you get up from a horror film, you are hopefully intelligent enough to know that the action on the screen is not possible in the real world.  You have just been treated to little fright akin to a ride on a good roller coaster.  If the movie made you jump, squirm, turn from the screen, or possibly yelp, then its done its job.Jeepers Creepers does far more than that.

I want to know what the hell is going on and why.  There is one exception to that and that would be Blair Witch Project.  Unfortunately, this movie does not supply me with any useful information about what and why everything is happening.  I also want a movie to deliver when it claims to have the scariest opening sequence and the gutsiest ending.  This movie does not deliver on either one of those claims.  If simply leaving the movie unfinished and open at the end is gutsy, then I say NO to gutsy endings.

From main characters acting stupid and stubborn when wisdom says otherwise, to procrasting when you should be running away for help, to making bad decisions at every turn.  This was just a very pathetic way to string together what you would normally call a plot.The story itself was pretty decent and the main actors gave a nice perfomance too.  If the script had been written by someone who actually had a triple digit IQ, it might have been entertaining.  There were just too many illogical or unreasonable elements that made this movie seem so dumb, for a lack of better word.  On top of these elements, the flow of the movie was also too simplistic.  Not only did they give away the ending halfway through the movie, you can basically call out what would happen next, two-thirds of the time.

679364,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B00005RHGK,Howard M. Kindel,"[1, 1]","I read a sampling of the 5-star reviews and a sampling of the 1-star reviews. My own review of Jeepers Creepers comes much closer to the 5-star reviews.  Like many others, I also think the 1-star reviewers failed to grasp the real horror of this film.  It's not about a scary monster so much as it is about a morbidly scared kid who in no way, shape or form deserves his fate - even though he inadvertently brings about that very fate.  The 1-star reviewers all wondered why Derry and his sister don't just keep on driving till they're safely away - and they might have been able to if Derry hadn't been unwilling to simply turn his back on the body thrown down the well. But once they gave up that one and only chance to get away, they will never be safely away from this creature who has fixed on Derry as his next victim.  This isn't your typical grab someone, anyone, and chow down monster.  This is a monster who chooses his next meal very carefully, following a very rigid protocol.  This is truly a serial-killer monster.  Okay, he flies; okay, he drives a truck that looks more like a Sherman tank.  Granted, that's a bit over the top: your typical monster wouldn't drive and fly.  He also leaps in a single bound.  And I have to admit the whole Jeepers Creepers bit falls flat; it's like the director wanted to work that song in somehow - but forgot to give some idea how the monster got addicted to it.  Most of all, the 1-star reviewers are 180 degrees off about the acting.  The acting is absolutely perfect for the movie; and Justin Long's Derry is as well-acted as anyone you're going to find in this genre.  Before the movie's half over, you know Derry like a book, inside and out - and there is more to him than just being scared out of his mind.  That happens to be good, not bad, acting.  And you genuinely care about him and what happens to him - because you come to realize that, of all the people on the planet, he's the least prepared to cope with something like this.  That counts for a lot in a movie.By far the most disturbing aspect of this movie - and I'm tempted to think the real reason a lot of people hated it - is that the bad guy wins.  Even for a horror movie devotee like me that's quite a jolt.  You just come to expect - especially in this genre - that good will always triumph over evil.  But this time it doesn't.  And no matter how many times you watch the movie, the ending still get to you.",5,After Viewing Samples...,1205884800,"03 19, 2008",2008,2432,"['read', 'sampling', '5-star', 'reviews', 'sampling', '1-star', 'reviews', 'own', 'review', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'much', 'closer', '5-star', 'reviews', 'many', 'others', 'also', 'think', '1-star', 'reviewers', 'failed', 'grasp', 'real', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'scary', 'monster', 'so', 'much', 'morbidly', 'scared', 'kid', 'who', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'fate', 'even', 'inadvertently', 'very', 'fate', '1-star', 'reviewers', 'wondered', 'why', 'Derry', 'sister', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'keep', 'driving', 'till', ""'re"", 'safely', 'away', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'Derry', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'unwilling', 'simply', 'turn', 'back', 'body', 'well', 'gave', 'up', 'one', 'only', 'chance', 'get', 'away', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'safely', 'away', 'creature', 'who', 'fixed', 'Derry', 'next', 'victim', ""n't"", 'typical', 'grab', 'someone', 'anyone', 'chow', 'down', 'monster', 'monster', 'who', 'next', 'meal', 'very', 'carefully', 'following', 'very', 'rigid', 'protocol', 'truly', 'serial-killer', 'monster', 'Okay', 'okay', 'truck', 'more', 'Sherman', 'tank', 'Granted', 'bit', 'top', 'typical', 'monster', 'would', ""n't"", 'drive', 'fly', 'also', 'single', 'bound', 'have', 'admit', 'whole', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'bit', 'falls', 'flat', 'director', 'wanted', 'work', 'song', 'somehow', 'forgot', 'give', 'idea', 'how', 'monster', 'got', 'addicted', 'Most', '1-star', 'reviewers', 'are', '180', 'degrees', 'acting', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'movie', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Derry', 'as', 'well-acted', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'going', 'find', 'genre', 'movie', 'half', 'know', 'Derry', 'book', 'inside', 'more', 'just', 'being', 'scared', 'mind', 'be', 'good', 'not', 'bad', 'acting', 'genuinely', 'care', 'what', 'come', 'realize', 'people', 'planet', 'least', 'prepared', 'cope', 'something', 'lot', 'movie.By', 'far', 'most', 'disturbing', 'aspect', 'movie', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'think', 'real', 'reason', 'lot', 'people', 'hated', 'bad', 'guy', 'wins', 'Even', 'horror', 'movie', 'devotee', 'quite', 'jolt', 'just', 'come', 'expect', 'especially', 'genre', 'good', 'will', 'always', 'triumph', 'over', 'evil', 'time', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'movie', 'ending', 'still', 'get']",Jeepers Creepers

Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.The Blu-ray is in 1.85:1 1080p and it is an improvement on the DVD, however there are just a few too many scenes shot in soft focus which don't give it much of a pop. The black levels are impressive though.

679367,A1JV3OZZVLHW85,B00005RHGK,Jaime Rafael Vazquez,"[0, 2]","Let me start off by saying that when it comes to scary movies I'm a big wussie.  So when Jeepers Creepers came out in theatres I didn't rush to see it.  About a year or so later they showed it on Showtime and I figured I was safe within the confines of my own home.  The boogie man couldn't get thru my two inch thick wooden door or cheap window glass pane (I know, I'm an idiot).  So I sat down and since there was nothing else on, I watched.  Let me continue by saying this movie was not scary.  The people that said this movie was the scariest thing they've seen in years either have to get out more or are bigger wussies then I am (and I am up there).  Now even though the movie was not scary it was still an ok movie that's good on a rainy day or when you've got an hour and a half to kill.  So sit back and read on while I tell you the story of the Creeper.  The movie starts out with two collage siblings Trish and Darry.  They decide to ride home together and on the way they play brother and sister games like who can read a vanity license plate first and calling each other names (basicly bugging each other, if you have a sibling like I do then you know what I mean).  While driving, they almost get run off the road by a big old farmers truck with a suped up egine, his license plate: BEATNGU.  The truck passes them and the kids contine down the road.  A few miles down they see the truck again.  This time it's parked next to an old church and this (looks like a) man is throwing a few things down a sewer pipe, things resembling dead bodies wraped in bloody sheets.  Now this is the part of the movie where you stand up from your chair, point your finger to the screen and yell ""IDIOT"".  Instead of going straight to the cops the kids decide to make a u-turn and head to the old church to see what is at the end of the sewer pipe.  Sister Trish holds brother Darry by the ankles to get a closer look in the pipe but when they both see rats they both freak out and Trish lets go of her brother and down he goes.  The pipe leads to the cellar of the church and Darry tells Trish to basicly wait on the side of the road till she see help while He finds a way out.  While he's down there Darry sees one of the wraped packages seen thrown down the pipe, when he opens it he is shocked to find a body with a homemade surgical cut running down the torso but the body is still alive.  He also finds hundreds of dead naked bodies stuck to the ceiling and walls like christmas decorations.  Darry finds a way back to his sister and they head to the nearest phone to call the police.  They stop at a diner and while there they get a call on the pay phone from a women who says she has seen everything that will happen and tries to warn them.  They don't believe her and they hang up.  The police then show up, the kids tells their story and the police give them an escort back to the station.  But on the way they run into a little trouble.  The Creeper (the bad guy in this flick) takes out the two cops and then begins to eat one of their heads (at least the tounge).  The kids don't believe what they're seeing and then drive off to find another phone.  They find an old lady with a bunch of cats (a vision from the pay phone lady) but before the are able to use her phone the Creeper takes her out.  The kids get back in the car and try to leave but the Creeper stands in the middle of the road blocking their way.  Then after running him over 4 or 5 times we see that the villian in this pic... has wings?  The two get to the police station, tell the cops what happened and then call their parents.  The lady that called them at the diner shows up and tries two warn them again that the Creeper is after one of them.  Then tells them the storry of our monster.  Every 23 years for 23 days it gets to eat all it wants.  And its favorite meal on the menu is people.  Just then the lights and the phones go out and the cops try to battle the monster but nothing works.  So who does the Creeper want?  Who lives and who dies (besides almost every body)?  Will you feel you've wasted an hour and a half of your life after this?  Maybe, maybe not.  The dead bodies look really fake and the CGI on the wings and the flying Creeper look bad, not terrible but bad.  But if you like movies that are supposed to be scary and aren't then I suggest you pick up this dvd (to rent or buy).

Typical of that age, Darry is bringing his laundry home for his mother.  All is normal until they encounter someone with what appears to be the most severe case of road rage ever.Out of nowhere, a massive, paint smeared, rusted, ominous truck appears.  It even comes with the loud, obnoxious, fog horn.  In a matter of no time, it's on the kid's bumper, tailgating and honking, scaring the hell out of them.  They eventually let it get by, and the license plate is revealed: BEATNGU...foreshadowing.Just as their fear and worry has subsided, they run upon the same scary truck parked at an old, abandoned church.  The driver is outsie of the vehicle, and appears to be tossing bodies wrapped in bloody sheets down a large pipe of some sort.  Unfortunately for them, the person sees them and quickly jumps in the Fearmobile for the chase.  This time, however, the truck starts ramming the kids' car and scaring Darry and Trish until they run off the road.What follows is a tale of fear, as brother and sister go back to investigate the pipe, and uncover a grisly reality that will shock and terrify them.The unfortunate part of this movie is that the bad guy turns out to be a completely cheesy, winged, alien of some kind.  When it is presumed to be a mysterious, evil man, the fear is much more palpable.  But when the large human/bat/chicken thing shows itself, the tone is completely different.

The film doesn't waste much time getting right into the plot which is good. The plot is also very basic, a brother and sister driving home along the backroads from college. They are menaced off the road by a maniac in an old fashioned car. After surviving the scare of their lives, the loony drives away and the kids think all is well. As they continue driving they spot the maniac's truck at an abandoned old church. They see the guy chucking what appears to be bodies into a sewer drain. The story progresses well from here incorporating elements of the supernatural and standard horror. The director of Jeepers Creepers is the true star of the film. You can tell he is an avid fan of the genre and knows exactly what buttons to push to scare the hell out of you.

679376,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005RHGK,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 4]","I hear an amazing amount of chatter nowadays about the generally poor quality of recent horror film releases. Fans of the genre point to films plagued with cliches, the endless stream of remakes, and just about anything else they find objectionable as evidence that the era of horror is over. I'm not absolving myself here; I do a fair amount of complaining myself from time to time. It's easy to do when you watch something like ""Shatter Dead"" or ""Slash."" If I truly thought these two films represented the future of horror, I would volunteer to shovel the first bit of dirt on the grave myself. Then again, there are people who genuinely like these two movies and wish to see more films like them. Personally, I am getting to the point where I welcome the good with the bad. For one thing, I secretly enjoy watching terrible films. There is something enormously entertaining about trashing a real piece of schlock. Too, I would rather see ANY horror film arriving on the scene than none at all. Think about it: if people quit renting horror, the next wave of fans turned talented directors and producers might never fulfill their destinies. All of this is a rather convoluted way to say the following: ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a pretty good modern horror movie. It's definitely not another ""Shatter Dead"" or ""Slash.""""Jeepers Creepers"" tells the horrific tale of Trish Jenner (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long). The problems begin when Darry drives his sister home from college. This isn't your normal jaunt across town or through a couple of neighborhoods, but a cross-country excursion that takes several days. Worse, the two have to navigate their way through the flat plains of the Midwest, which, as I can assure you from personal experience, is a daunting expedition. In the true tradition of Hollywood, they can't pick anything up on their radio except some loudmouth preacher bible thumping about the apocalypse. Since the trip takes place during the summer, the heat makes them antsy. The opening sequences of the movie show the two quibbling with each other about personal problems and their parents. Trish also takes Darry to task for straying far from the security of the interstate system in order to take the ""scenic"" route. Needless to say, she's more right than she knows. Things take an ominous turn when a souped up black truck/van hybrid roars up behind them. With horn blazing away, this vehicle repeatedly swerves, bumps into Darry's car, and generally acts like most drivers in my hometown. He runs the two kids off the road but doesn't bother stopping.Later, when the two happen to cruise by an abandoned church just in time to see the driver of the aforementioned black vehicle dumping what looks like a body wrapped in a bloody sheet down a drainpipe, the trip takes on ominous dimensions. He--at least we think it's a he although it's hard to tell with all those black clothes and a coat on--jumps into his car and comes after them again. Trish and Darry manage to avoid another confrontation but foolishly decide to head over to the church to see what went into the pipe. Down into the ground goes Darry, only to discover an enormous cavern decorated with human wallpaper. It appears that the guy dumping corpses into this pipe has been doing it for eons considering the number of bodies hanging all over the place. Darry manages to get out, reunite with Trish, and hightail it down the road to the nearest diner to make the obligatory call to the cops. But yet another weird incident occurs, this time an out of the blue phone call to the kids on the payphone from a woman claiming to be a psychic. She knows all about what they saw and warns them of extreme danger. What we eventually learn about this guy is that he's no guy at all, but some flying demon awakened from his years long sleep. He's out collecting humans and now he has his sights set on Trish and Darry. Throw in the Cat Lady (Eileen Brennan), a couple of cannon fodder cops, good gore, and you have all the makings for a fun filled horror romp.The first part of ""Jeepers Creepers"" works better than the second half. The rather calm world of the Jenner kids suddenly shattered by a weirdo in a spooky vehicle out in the middle of nowhere is a terrifying proposition that the film pulls off well. Just as eerie is the glimpse of this black clad figure dumping the corpse in the drainpipe. Although I can't find it anywhere on the web, I swear that the writer got the idea for this scene from an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" where the same situation happened to several travelers somewhere in the United States (minus the flying demon, of course). Once the psychic Jezelle (Patricia Belchar) physically enters the picture, the movie loses some of its steam. By this time Trish and Darry are in a police station facing the prospect of the Creeper running rampant in the building. The resulting scenes of carnage reminded me too much of a similar scene in ""Darkness Falls"" even though ""Jeepers Creepers"" did it first. In short, I think the movie is scarier when we don't know what Trish and Darry are up against.Still, ""Jeepers Creepers"" is definitely worth watching. For once MGM actually loaded up for bear with the extras. We get a commentary track with director Victor Salva, plenty of deleted scenes, stills, cast and crew filmographies, and a making of featurette. Followed by an intriguing sequel that is in and of itself entertaining although it doesn't quite capture the magic of the first installment, ""Jeepers Creepers"" is a prime example of how horror movies can still attain a measure of originality and scares.",4,Scary,1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,5631,"['hear', 'amazing', 'amount', 'chatter', 'nowadays', 'generally', 'poor', 'quality', 'recent',

The first movie answers little to nothing.  If anything, this movie was one big question mark.Without going into detail of the story, suffice it to say that the main characters, the police, the psychic, and we the viewers have no idea what the creature is.  For horror aficionados, the creature is well done and scary.  Ideas of demons and or animal hybrids may come to mind.  Unfortunately for us, the movie never goes into detail.  The attempt of the creature to appear somewhat human is thrilling.The main characters are a brother and sister traveling home from college.  Part of their discussion, as well as their trip to begin with, border on urban legend.  The siblings argue back and forth as only siblings can, but these actors do almost too good a job.  Before too long into the movie, I found myself completely siding with one and losing my temper with the other.  (Who hasn't yelled at the TV?)  Although this seems to detract for the story, the emotional response added to the movie experience for me.Although I haven't seen the next one, I would hope that it answers the questions raised in this one.

Incredulous, slack jawed townies (apparently what Hollywood thinks inhabits every `burg that isn't LA or NYC) in local diner gawp at our young protagonists.  Unsympathetic local police are quickly dispatched by monster.  If any of this sounds familiar, just wait until you see the showdown at the local constabulary.Jeepers Creepers wastes most of its opening sequence trying to establish what a close relationship our young brother-and-sister victims share, and it's only downhill from there.  The monster, a demonic creature who unfortunately for us appears to be just a guy in rubbery-looking suit, is a MAJOR disappointment.  Locust-like, it emerges from its lair for 23 days every 23 years to replace its body parts by feasting on the flesh and viscera of its specially selected victims.  We are offered no explanation as to the significance of the number 23.  It lives in the basement of an abandoned church (where the victims are turned into a cool but fake looking 3-D wall treatment a la Aliens), and sports about town in an outlandish looking vehicle that has a really cool horn and vanity plates that roughly translate into `be eating you'.  I'm not really sure how it renews them since it only appears every 23 years.  An even bigger mystery is why an abandoned church, has a three-foot wide culvert pipe protruding from the ground at a 45 degree angle that leads to its basement.  Besides being convenient for a poorly imagined script, that is.Basically the redeeming qualities of this film are the villain's car horn, a relatively inoffensive performance from Galaxy Quest's Brandon and a very amusing underpants joke.

In her all-too-brief screen time she is hilarious and touching... chilling and endearing.Jonathan Breck's Creeper offers a truly original, thought-provoking monster; effortlessly giving Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees a run for their money as title holders for the genre's scariest baddie.The flick's behind-the-scenes wizards deserve special mention.

Rather than the traditional story structure of beginning middle and end, writer-director Victor Salva seems to make do with the first two-thirds of that formula to craft allegedly &quot;the best US horror film in the last ten years&quot;.Not that Salva is a bad director. The first 30 minutes of this unassuming horror film is actually great stuff, which leaves me wondering if the original idea was for a 30 minute short piece which would have worked beautifully. Salva is not a hack, and his camera set-ups (lots of low angle shots during the car chases, some superb high-angle ones of the very atmospheric church, the movement of the camera between the car of the central characters and a following police car during conversation) suggest great potential.But the film falls down quite horribly once Salva tries to explain the weird goings-on in his first act. The whole thing lacks any sense of internal logic for all the reasons stated in the other reviews on this site. You can wheel on a psychic to explain your back story as long as that back story makes sense &amp; is leading somewhere. Blathering on a bit about every 23 Springs and foretelling the end of the film just so that you can end on a gag that justifies the title of the movie is not a good excuse. If only Salva had used a better writer to iron out these mistakes and put in a more satisfctory climax this could have approached classic status.It's actually not difficult for Jeepers Creepers to be &quot;the best US horror movie for the last ten years&quot; because there hasn't been a lot for it to compete with. Go back 20 years and you'll find that ReAnimator, Evil Dead and the original Elm Street can still wipe the floor with this little horror pic.

I don't mean creepy in a good horror movie way, I mean creepy like odd and disconcerting. First of all, ""Jeepers Creepers"" is an ""okay"" horror film I guess, nothing original. But the thing that bothered me when I first saw these two movies is that there is a weird running theme that goes against normal movie convention. In Part 1, Justin Long plays the male protagonist but assumes the role of the ""female victim"". For some reason the creature becomes obsessed with him, starts stalking him and steals and sniffs his laundry. Isn't this what normally happens to the female protagonist in horror films? Unless of course the creature is gay. In Part 2, a bunch of high school football players and cheerleaders get stranded while traveling in a school bus. For some reason, the football players use this opportunity to take off their clothes and sun bathe on top of the bus. Huh?? How many men would do this? Isn't this what female characters normally do in horror films to achieve the obligatory T&A shots? Why aren't the slutty cheerleaders taking their clothes off? It gives a strange, uncomfortable quality to both movies. Later I found out the director was a convicted child molester who molested boys. NOW IT ALL MADE SENSE!!

The Creeper is a very cool creature, and the arguing brother and sister aren't really a common set of main characters in other movies, so they help with the believibility of the story.  The story pretty much revolves around two siblings trying to get away from a monster guy who drives a really sweet (yet durty and old) truck and tries to eat them.  The whole point is that he likes to scare people and that's why he doesn't kill them at first.  He only is awake for 23 days every 23 years (I own the movie and I'm not for sure on that though).  There are some pretty cool scenes that add a little suspense and some locations that add to the overall creepy (no pun intended) mood of the story.

If I hadn't recognized Justin's face from Dodgeball (ugh, another train wreck), I wouldn't have stopped clicking through the channels. When I saw him, I was interested in how he acted. Dodgeball was all I had seen him in, and I thought he was one of the better aspects of the movie. I hadn't been following his career, so seeing him in this film was new to me.What intrigued me was the polarity of characters that Justin portrayed. One was a terrified teenager, running from your typical Freddy, Jason, Michael, etc. Seriously - there was absolutely nothing unique or interesting in the ""bad guy"" in this film. Who was he/she, and why did the delightful song ""Jeepers Creepers"" mean anything to him/her? Are you hard pressed to come up with a logical answer? Me too. This would have been better if the killer had popped out of a lake, or a meteor. Better yet, a cactus. That would have taken some intellect and creativity to resolve.In Dodgeball, Justin was simply running scared because he was absolutely unathletic and didn't have a prayer in that silly game they played. (My opinion of the movie itself, for what it's worth, is, well, it was abysmall. Dogeball was rank. That said, the ""gaffer"" on that film probably made more in one month than I make in a year. Jerk.) Still, Justin made his character believable in Dodgeball, and honestly saved the film for me (although in such a tiny, minute fashion).In Jeepers Creepers here he did the same, but to a greater extent. I never thought I'd tie two characters of such wildly divergent (B) movies together and say they did an excellent job, but I have to break rank here.The female lead in ""Jeepers Creepers"", Gina Phillips was an extreme bore. This is unusual in boy/girl horror films. It's usually a given that the girl is favored. Not so here, and that says quite a bit about Justin's abilities. He's only 28, so he has quite a while to catch on to something huge. I hope he does. At the time of the filming of ""Jeepers Creepers"" he was about 22. Success awaits. (And, lucky guy, he looks far younger than his years account for.)Regarding the film - my lord, this was awful. How did it spawn (or spam) a sequel?? This movie was so lame I can't imagine it making any money on a sequel. Yet the sequel did better with Video Rentals than the original, so all in all it made more money. I've yet to see the sequel, but now am very interested in seeing it.Coming back to the movie at hand...I've read reviews where the reviewer has said that the ""villain"" was fully realized. I just have to add to this to that...""What?"" Were they high? Seriously, the villain in this film was one of the absolute worst I've seen in any horror film.

It focuses on a brother and sister who have the unfortunate luck of crossing the path of the bad guy, who is convincingly frightening. The siblings do their share of dumb things to get all of the mayhem kicked off and proceed to partake in a tense cat and mouse game with what appears to be an unstoppable force of nature. The movie is fun, tense, and handled well enough to never become insulting and the ending is particularly surprising. See, Jeepers Creepers actually builds the siblings' characters up enough that you kind of care about what happens to them. They are not just the proverbial meat market of cliche weekend camper killer bait.

679404,AUEG8CLKEZSWV,B00005RHGK,Julia,"[0, 0]","Jeepers Creepers is a scary film that gets your heart racing and it does get you pretty excited. The music and the scenery is what really sets the whole mood of the movie. Throught out the film there are scenes where it is pretty dark and some very bright. It takes place in a very rural area, where you rarely ever see any cars. The setting is also completed with crows, an old gas station, and an old abandonded, dilapidated church.The music is mostly instrumental, and of course their is the famous song, ""Jeepers Creepers"". The instrumental music is very grim and can in some climaxing parts of the movie get pretty loud and even more creepy sounding.I think the best aspect of the movie is the fact that they really don't reveal the sinister character in a way that it didn't look really fake at all. It wasn't like in the movie Signs how they showed the alien completely, they kind of kept this characters appearence a secret. It wasn't until later in the movie they showed the characters face for a short time. I am not going to give the movie away, but their was a scene in the movie where they did show the body of a person, but they used a wax person, and it did look fake. You could definately tell that the person was not real and you could see how the features were implied.Jeepers Creepers is not one of those chessy films, in which you know what is going to happen in every scene. The film has its mysteries, and you will definately not get bored from watching it. The movie gives a great performance from Justin Long and Gina Phillips. This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again, and it will still scare you each time.The DVD also features great special features. The DVD disc has two sides to it. On one side you can play the film. On this side you can turn the Audio comentary with the director Victor Salva on or off,you can decide whether you want Widescreen or Standard sized screen, and you can decide between three spoken languages. Another thing you can do is look at the cast's filmographies. On the other side it has all the other special features. You can enjoy watching deleted and extended scenes, the making of the movie, and theatrical trailers of the following movies:Jeepers Creepers, Hannibal,The Silence of the Lambs Special Edition DVD Trailer, The Terminator Special Edition DVD Trailer, and the Carrie Special Edition DVD Trailer.All in all I think that if you love to watch scary movies, than this is the right movie for you.

679409,AKB75HRACZIOP,B00005RHGK,Karl Morkunas,"[1, 2]","Based on Freytag's pyramid of Drama, the rising action of the film; the introduction of the creature, was incredibly intriguing. But when it came to the climax, falling action, and d&eacute;nouement (ending), the movie completly failed. Just when one is thinking that this is an exception to the regular C horror movies, your trust is lost once again. I recall people booing at the end of the movie and not one positive opinion was said. The ultimate fuel of horror and horror movies is not knowing the physical looks of what is putting you in the state of horror, therefore more horror movies should follow this rule. In the scene where the villian creature is driving that old rusty truck (which reminds one of Sweet Tooth's icecream truck from the Twisted Metal games) and crashing it into the teenagers car is an example of not showing the physical looks of the host of terror. There is an exception to commonly broken rule: If one shows the physical lookes of the host of terror at the ending in an unforgetable scene then one has achieved the goal of a succesful horror movie. We can also derive this rule from the Scream triolgy movies, even though they are not depicted as classic acts of horror. What also disappoints critics is the three questions that remained unasnwered about the villian creature include:1. What is this thing?2. Why it is here?3.

679417,A3PNHHF9XWHJGR,B00005RHGK,"Kyle Smeby ""kyle78""","[1, 4]","There is a method of shooting horror films where certain elements are masked in the shadows and what you don't see can be more terrifying that what you do--this movie didn't use this technique. I guess the director thought this movie would be even scarier if you couldn't see anything at all. An innovative solution, but I think it came up a little short.Truly good movies have another element called pacing. That's where the pace of the movie slows down to deliver character and plot information, then speeds up to send you racing through action sequences. So at the end of the movie you feel well informed and entertained. They elected not to do this in this movie as well. It starts off nice and slow with the main characters establishing themselves, that drags on a bit too long, and then they inexplicably reversed the equation with the action sequences being painfully slow, and rushing through any informative scenes. So at the end of the movie if felt uninformed and irritated.Foreshadowing is another method good stories use to make you anticipate what is going to happen later in the movie without giving it away, so once it is revealed everything clicks into place and you have all the satisfaction of seeing the last piece of the puzzle fit into place and you really knew what it was the whole time, but couldn't quite put your finger on it. The title of this movie contains such a device, although it was utilized with all the finesse and understanding of a junior-highschool remedial english student. They attempted to use it in two different methods (both of which are valid) each of which undermined the other, and either one on its own would still be considered half-baked.I could go on and on, but I've already wasted more time than I care to on this wasteland of a movie. Was there even a script? It just seems like they were shooting by the seat-of -there-pants. As each scene drags on I can practically hear Ed Wood barking directions from off-camera. The thing that really makes me lose sleep over this sad excuse for a movie is that Francis Ford Coppola actually put his name on it--he has a producer credit. I just can't even begin to understand.

679421,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005RHGK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 10]","I actually managed to watch this movie without having ever seen the trailer, which accounts for my reaction.  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; begins with a pair of bickering siblings, Patricia (Gina Philips) and Darius Jenner (Justin Long) driving home from college along a fairly deserted back road.  Shortly after discussing the local rural legend, a nice little cautionary tale about drinking and driving, a speeding truck (a late 1940's Model Rio, a flatbed truck with the back built up to look a bit like a meat wagon from Hell) sneaks up on them and just about runs them off the road.  Shaken by their escape, the kids become even more rattled when they drive by a rundown church and see the truck, with its odd looking driver now doing something rather unsettling.  To make matters worse, he sees them, and once again the truck sets off in pursuit.In terms of contemporary horror films, the opening for &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; is extremely effective.  After all, it takes place in the bright light of day and still manages to creep you out.  But then, as Patty notes, we get to the part where the kids in the movie do something stupid that ultimately dooms them to the horrors of the rest of the film.  Actually, when Darry discovers the grim truth of what has been going on underneath that old church, this 2001 horror film reaches its high point.  At that point &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; goes off in a rather unexpected and ultimately unrewarding direction.  If you have seen the trailer, then you already know what the payoff is (although why a movie would want to give that much away in the trailer is, as always, beyond me), but I was not only surprised, but rather disappointed.This is a shame because the performances by the two leads in this film are way above the traditional low bar set in a splatter flick.  Phillips and Long do not especially look like siblings, but they fight like them.  More importantly, they manage to maintain a sense of realism as the proceedings get more absurd.  They are clearly the best thing in this film (Long was nominated for a Saturn Award), along with the truck.  But once Darry learns the truth, writer-director Victor Salva throws away the film's powerful momentum to enter the familiar slasher silliness of Freddy and Jason territory.  Given the level of tension that is created, I was actually a bit miffed that suddenly the film was invoking humor.  The final shot of the film is rather predictable given the premise, but its greater sin is in running counter to the tone of the film's opening.Admittedly, I might have rated this film higher if I had known what it was really all about because then the payoff would not have been such a disappointment.  To be fair, given how strong the opening of &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; is it might have been impossible to come up with an ending as good, but I sure would have liked to have seen Salva come up with a better effort.

679425,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B00005RHGK,Libretio,"[15, 19]","JEEPERS CREEPERS(USA/Germany - 2001)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSAdding its own particular twist to the currently popular teen-horror cycle, JEEPERS CREEPERS - the sleeper hit of 2001, co-produced by Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios - demonstrates how a fairly conventional narrative can be enhanced by the kind of loving care and attention to detail exhibited here by writer-director Victor Salva. His clever, attentive script describes the terrifying experiences of teenage siblings Trish and Darry (played with exceptional warmth and sincerity by attractive newcomers Gina Philips and Justin Long) who are driving home from college when they're terrorized by a demonic creature which initially runs them off a lonely country road. After stumbling into the monster's lair and uncovering it's ghastly secrets (a genuinely heart-stopping set-piece), the kids flee from the monster's wrath, only to be warned by a terrified psychic (an ultra-creepy performance by Patricia Belcher) that the creature has targeted them for a particular reason and won't let them go... ever.From the dark-hearted drama of NATURE OF THE BEAST (1994) and RITES OF PASSAGE (1998) to the spiritual uplift of POWDER (1995), Salva has always demonstrated a willingness to challenge the conventions of mainstream cinema by thwarting audience expectations at every turn, and JEEPERS CREEPERS is no exception. An avowed fan of old-time monster movies, the director has marshalled his considerable creative resources to produce an equally old-fashioned creature feature, updated for modern sensibilities and characterized by jump-out-of-your-seat thrills, a well-developed sense of irony, and plenty of heart and soul. To top it all off, there's also a pretty impressive monster - a combination of clever makeup, CGI effects, and a truly menacing performance by Jonathan Breck, buried beneath masses of latex and foam rubber.With nods to an assortment of genre outings, especially DUEL (1971) - which the director happily acknowledges - the film maintains a breathless pace before culminating in a final showdown which capitalizes on the strong emotional undertow established during the opening sequences. In a commentary recorded for the film's original US DVD release, Salva mentioned that he was forced to cut twenty pages from this section of the script for budgetary reasons but, crucially, he doesn't mention what those missing pages contained. Perhaps he's saving them for the forthcoming sequel?With fabulous, evocative production design by Steven Legler, and equally moody cinematography by frequent Salva collaborator Don E. FauntLeRoy, which transforms the central Florida locations into a Gothic, brooding 21st century dreamscape, the movie's relentless forward momentum allows just enough humor to offset the ultra-convincing trauma suffered by the principal characters as they pit their wits against a merciless force of supernatural horror. However, Salva's normally impeccable judgment is slightly compromised by an unwarranted, needlessly cruel postscript: Having staged a predictably lavish, crowd-pleasing finale that scales the heights of operatic tragedy, Salva chooses to close proceedings with a downbeat coda that's actually more depressing than horrific, and seems completely out of tune with the Big Fun Monster Movie that precedes it. It's the only significant flaw in an otherwise perfectly realized miniature.Followed by JEEPERS CREEPERS II (2002).",5,Old-fashioned creature feature with plenty of heart and soul,1010966400,"01 14, 2002",2002,3495,"['JEEPERS', 'CREEPERS', 'USA/Germany', '2001', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Theatrical', 'soundtracks', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '/', 'DTS', '/', 'SDDSAdding', 'own', 'particular', 'twist', 'currently', 'popular', 'teen-horror', 'cycle', 'JEEPERS', 'CREEPERS', 'sleeper', 'hit', '2001', 'co-produced', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Zoetrope', 'Studios', 'how', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'can', 'be', 'enhanced', 'kind', 'loving', 'care', 'attention', 'detail', 'exhibited', 'here', 'writer-director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'clever', 'attentive', 'script', 'terrifying', 'experiences', 'teenage', 'siblings', 'Trish', 'Darry', 'played', 'exceptional', 'warmth', 'sincerity', 'attractive', 'newcomers', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'Justin', 'Long', 'who', 'are', 'driving', 'home', 'college', 'when', ""'re"", 'terrorized', 'demonic', 'creature', 'initially', 'off', 'lonely', 'country', 'road', 'stumbling', 'monster', 'lair', 'uncovering', 'ghastly', 'secrets', 'genuinely', 'heart-stopping', 'set-piece', 'kids', 'flee', 'monster', 'wrath', 'only', 'be', 'warned', 'terrified', 'psychic', 'ultra-creepy', 'performance', 'Patricia', 'Belcher', 'creature', 'targeted', 'particular', 'reason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'dark-hearted', 'drama', 'NATURE', 'THE', 'BEAST', '1994', 'RITES', 'OF', 'PASSAGE', '1998', 'spiritual', 'uplift', 'POWDER', '1995', 'Salva', 'always', 'demonstrated', 'willingness', 'challenge', 'conventions', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'thwarting', 'audience', 'expectations', 'turn', 'JEEPERS', 'CREEPERS', 'exception', 'avowed', 'fan', 'old-time', 'monster', 'movies', 'director', 'marshalled', 'considerable', 'creative', 'resources', 'produce', 'equally', 'old-fashioned', 'creature', 'feature', 'updated', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'characterized', 'jump-out-of-your-seat', 'thrills', 'well-developed', 'sense', 'irony', 'plenty', 'heart', 'soul', 'top', 'off', 'also', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'monster', 'combination', 'clever', 'makeup', 'CGI', 'effects', 'truly', 'menacing', 'performance', 'Jonathan', 'Breck', 'buried', 'beneath', 'masses', 'latex', 'foam', 'rubber.With', 'nods', 'assortment', 'genre', 'outings', 'especially', 'DUEL', '1971', 'director', 'happily', 'film', 'breathless', 'pace', 'culminating', 'final', 'showdown', 'strong', 'emotional', 'undertow', 'established', 'opening', 'sequences', 'commentary', 'recorded', 'film', 'original', 'US', 'DVD', 'release', 'Salva', 'mentioned', 'was', 'forced', 'cut', 'twenty', 'pages', 'section', 'script', 'budgetary', 'reasons', 'crucially', ""n't"", 'mention', 'what', 'missing', 'pages', 'contained', 'Perhaps', 'saving', 'forthcoming', 'sequel', 'fabulous', 'evocative', 'production', 'design', 'Steven', 'Legler', 'equally', 'moody', 'cinematography', 'frequent', 'Salva', 'collaborator', 'Don', 'E.', 'FauntLeRoy', 'central', 'Florida', 'locations', 'Gothic', 'brooding', '21st', 'century', 'dreamscape', 'movie', 'relentless', 'forward', 'momentum', 'just', 'enough', 'humor', 'offset', 'ultra-convincing', 'trauma', 'suffered', 'principal', 'characters', 'pit', 'wits', 'merciless', 'force', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'However', 'Salva', 'normally', 'impeccable', 'judgment', 'slightly', 'compromised', 'unwarranted', 'needlessly', 'cruel', 'postscript', 'Having', 'staged', 'predictably', 'lavish', 'crowd-pleasing', 'finale', 'heights', 'operatic', 'tragedy', 'Salva', 'close', 'proceedings', 'downbeat', 'coda', 'actually', 'more', 'depressing', 'horrific', 'completely', 'tune', 'Big', 'Fun', 'Monster', 'Movie', 'only', 'significant', 'flaw', 'otherwise', 'perfectly', 'realized', 'miniature.Followed', 'JEEPERS', 'CREEPERS', 'II', '2002']",Jeepers Creepers

Suffice it to say that you really should save yourself the agony if you haven't.The film could easily have ended if a parent had driven the car.(film)Brother: Did not!Sister: Did too!Brother: Did not!Sister: Did too!(divine intervention from parent): You kids either shut up or I'm going to turn this car around!!Other problems with this movie:1. Our demonic creature, invincible--even invulnerable--and scary, can fly...yes, FLY...yet feels compelled to drive (yes, DRIVE) around incognito in a truck stolen from the DUEL (nod to a good film by Spielberg) studio lot in a disguise that would have made DARKMAN say, &quot;Oh, please.&quot;2. Is this creature scary?*Yes!*After you?*Oh, yes, please someone stop it!*Is it eating a victim?*Why, yes it is...let's watch, sis, whaddya say?*Most people run when they have a chance, but not our &quot;static&quot; duo...they're going to watch every gruesome moment as our hero...um...demon begins to eat someone's head.3. The scarecrow scene. Was there a point? Did the demon really feel compelled to use a ruse that was devised more to scare the audience then to serve any meaningful purpose within the story's context? Also, what was up with the CATS???? The movie was creepy enough without some deranged woman who attempts to be creepy, but is just downright eccentric and in need of better lighting for her house. Advice: use Yellow Pages.4. Victims. Victims galore. Over 500 and counting in a deserted area. Did anyone ever think of looking? Even if they were all travelers, you think that the dragnet of law enforcement would sit and ponder, &quot;You know, those darned kids took the same route as the other 498 other missing cases in this darned area. Maybe we should ask that weird fellow at the abandoned building over yonder...seems kinda strange that there is a truck parked in front of it. *spitting and bell sound*&quot;5. Jeepers Creepers...where did you get those eyes...was this really meant to shock us at the end? Oh, the demon took the little fellow's eyes...what a surprise.6.  The CAR.  Oh, that hurt the most.  I could almost hear the director saying, &quot;Hey, Bob.  This scene needs some tension.  Whaddya think?&quot;  Bob:  &quot;Oh, I've got it!!  How about making the car difficult to start?!?  We haven't done that before!!&quot;  (repeat 6 times -- but when it's not necessary, make sure the car starts just fine like when they decide to run over the demon).  It was the first time that I can recall actually moaning out loud in a film every time I heard the engine grind.With some rework and common sense, this story could have worked beautifully. It's also nice to see a horror story that serves to perpetuate itself by not making us wonder if the demon died, but to let the demon survive. But the arguing between the two main characters who somehow manage to develop an undying bond near the film's end, a pointless psychic, a creature that obviously has no need for disguise if it can survive being run over by a car several times, law enforcement that practices &quot;let's stay in a huddle so one grenade could take us out&quot; tactics, and so on, was enough to make me say, &quot;What was that?

If it's director and writer, Victor Salva, had been able to sustain the mood he created in the movie's first third, it might have been a great one. Shortly before production began, he was informed that the picture's budget had been slashed. The result was the cutting of the shooting schedule from forty-five days to thirty-one and a lot less money for the art department, which is the one that creates special effects. In light of these constrains, he probably did the best he could.Trish and Darry [Gina Phillips and Justin Long] are returning home from college. Trish, who was recently dumped by her boyfriend, wants to take the long way home, a decision that takes the pair down a lonely country road. In the middle of nowhere, an ominous, rusty old truck roars up behind them and nearly causes them to crash. It finally passes them, but a few miles later, they spot it parked by an abandoned church. They see its occupant tossing something large wrapped in a blanket down a big drainpipe. In a decision which could only happen in this kind of movie, they go back to investigate. What they find there is scary enough, but what put it there is much more so. And it knows who they are.Horror movies come in several forms and often spill over into other genres, such as the psychological thriller. Jeepers Creepers is in the old-fashioned monster movie category, with shades of the occult. It's a cut above most recent efforts of this type. The music is quite atmospheric, and the photography and lighting are very professional. Salva knows how to set a scene up to maximize the effect on the audience.Salva is a good film maker who needs to polish his scripts a little more. He does a really excellent job of making his main characters more interesting and believable than those we usually encounter in such fare, but this makes the dumb things they do seem particularly unlikely. Still, I liked Trish and Darry more than most horror movie main characters. After Darry sees what lies at the bottom of of that drain pipe, he goes into shock. I think this is a much more likely reaction than the emotionally dead, macho reaction you usually see.Justin Long and Gina Phillips are quite good. Many actors seem to get their starts in horror movies. Jack Nicholson comes to mind. You can often spot the good ones, because they consistently give a fine performance whether the material demands it or not.Some people don't like horror movies.

Taking bets and sending me urgent e mails. I tell ya people, I am fast becoming the most talked about item in our modern a go-go society. Why, they even tell me I've already surpassed that ""Who Shot J.R."" thing from years ago. What? You don't remember that one? Well, to be honest, I hardly do. I think I was in Tangier at the time. Meeting dignataries, need you ask?Anyway, Halloween was just a short while ago, so I decided to watch a movie that would scare my pet dragon and octopus. So, I got this copy of ""Jeepers Creepers"" and settled in to watch it on my 60 inch HD t.v. with digital surround sound. I tell ya people, hearing flesh rip and blood spurting has never sounded more realistic. What a refreshing pleasure. (!!!).The plot revolves around a brother and sister driving home together from college. Trish and Darry Jenner do the typical sibling annoyances we all know and love. They pass a house and see this shadowy figure dump tied up bodies into a tunnel. If that wasn't enough to freak them out, the stranger gets into a truck and tries to run them off the road. After he passes, Darry, stupidly, gets hit with some perverted moral conscience and decides to return to investigate. Trish is not happy, and even more unhappy when Darry drops into the tunnel. What he spies down there is a horror beyond his wildest dreams. He eventually finds his way out and they take off to contact the authorities.Without giving all the plot away, this movie is about the evil stranger pursuing them. I like the suspense this movie provides and the jolts of horror throughout.Wisely, the unknown terror is what gives the movie it's impact. You never really see the Creeper from the start. As the scenes unfold, you get to glimpse, slowly, what this creature is and, eventually, why it is pursuing them. To say that the Creeper is hideous would be an understatement. To say that Metamorpho writes the best reviews in the universe, is an understatement as well. But, that is where all similarities end, thank-you.We learn that this creature surfaces every 23 years and has to feed off bodies (especially young people), for, to do so, he develops regenerative ability. Thus,  it's hard to kill this thing. The creature is a living, breathing, Wright Brothers Beelzebub, and also a Kitty Hawk. But, in order to really get that insanely clever line, you have to see the movie. In truth, I jumped out of my seat quite a few times and there was popcorn all over the floor. It's a good thing I hired a cleaning crew to take care of such matters.Anyway, a pretty entertaining horror film. I gave it 3 1/2 - 4 stars. It held your interest by maintaining an underlying dread. My other underlying dread was the fear of running out of Halloween candy for the kiddies. The movie I can deal with, but egging my castle windows is another situation entirely.Yours to your blood runs cold -- Metamorpho ;)",4,I Only Have Eyes for You............,1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,2969,"['Oh', 'see', 'water', 'cooler', 'now', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'review', 'next', 'Taking', 'bets', 'sending', 'urgent', 'e', 'mails', 'tell', 'ya', 'people', 'am', 'fast', 'becoming', 'most', 'talked', 'item', 'modern', 'go-go', 'society', 'Why', 'even', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'already', 'surpassed', 'Who', 'Shot', 'J.R.', 'thing', 'years', 'ago', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'one', 'Well', 'be', 'honest', 'hardly', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'Tangier', 'time', 'Meeting', 'dignataries', 'need', 'ask', 'Anyway', 'Halloween', 'was', 'just', 'short', 'while', 'ago', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'would', 'scare', 'pet', 'dragon', 'octopus', 'So', 'got', 'copy', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'settled', 'watch', '60', 'inch', 'HD', 't.v', 'digital', 'surround', 'sound', 'tell', 'ya', 'people', 'hearing', 'flesh', 'rip', 'blood', 'spurting', 'never', 'sounded', 'more', 'realistic', 'What', 'refreshing', 'pleasure', '.The', 'plot', 'around', 'brother', 'sister', 'driving', 'home', 'together', 'college', 'Trish', 'Darry', 'Jenner', 'do', 'typical', 'sibling', 'annoyances', 'know', 'love', 'pass', 'house', 'see', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'dump', 'tied', 'up', 'bodies', 'tunnel', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'freak', 'out', 'stranger', 'truck', 'tries', 'run', 'off', 'road', 'Darry', 'stupidly', 'hit', 'perverted', 'moral', 'conscience', 'return', 'investigate', 'Trish', 'not', 'happy', 'even', 'more', 'unhappy', 'when', 'Darry', 'tunnel', 'What', 'down', 'horror', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'eventually', 'way', 'take', 'off', 'contact', 'authorities.Without', 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'movie', 'evil', 'stranger', 'pursuing', 'suspense', 'movie', 'jolts', 'horror', 'throughout.Wisely', 'unknown', 'terror', 'what', 'movie', 'impact', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'Creeper', 'start', 'scenes', 'unfold', 'get', 'glimpse', 'slowly', 'what', 'creature', 'eventually', 'why', 'pursuing', 'say', 'Creeper', 'hideous', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'say', 'Metamorpho', 'best', 'reviews', 'universe', 'understatement', 'as', 'well', 'where', 'similarities', 'end', 'thank-you.We', 'learn', 'creature', '23', 'years', 'feed', 'off', 'bodies', 'especially', 'young', 'people', 'do', 'so', 'regenerative', 'ability', 'Thus', 'hard', 'kill', 'thing', 'creature', 'living', 'breathing', 'Wright', 'Brothers', 'Beelzebub', 'also', 'Kitty', 'Hawk', 'order', 'really', 'get', 'insanely', 'clever', 'line', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'truth', 'jumped', 'seat', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'popcorn', 'floor', 'good', 'thing', 'hired', 'cleaning', 'crew', 'take', 'care', 'such', 'matters.Anyway', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'horror', 'film', 'gave', '3', '1/2', '4', 'stars', 'held', 'interest', 'maintaining', 'underlying', 'dread', 'other', 'underlying', 'dread', 'was', 'fear', 'running', 'Halloween', 'candy', 'kiddies', 'movie', 'can', 'deal', 'egging', 'castle', 'situation', 'blood', 'runs', 'cold', 'Metamorpho']",Jeepers Creepers

They can lag in other areas, but if they deliver chills, shreiks, winces, gags (I mean the kind you make with your throat, not the kind you play on your friends) and a sense of, well, the creeps, that runs the whole film, you know you're on to something. ""Creepers"" does this and does it well. It's a short, well-crafted, brutally compact horror movie that uses storyline and atmosphere rather than buckets of the red stuff or an enormous kill-count to get your fear glands pumping. The story revolves around two sibling college students taking their ancient 1960s-era beater home on spring break via what looks to be the worlds longest and most desolate highway. On the way they spy a sinister-looking man dumping what appears to be bodies down a drainpipe, and here they commit their first ""Horror-Movie Mistake"" -- they investigate instead of getting the hell out of there. Turns out there is an extremely nasty surprise on the end of the pipe (think Sistine Chapel as designed by Dr. Lecter), but it's not until the two finally decide to split the scene -- and who wouldn't want to stay in a sewer pipe  -- that their troubles begin. Seems the mystery guy is on their scent (literally), and wants something from them, which he intends to remove without benefit of anesthetic. That's his gig, and he does it pretty well (hint: hiding in the police station will not help). ""Creepers"" is not a perfect film -- horror movies usually aren't -- but its flaws are the flaws of the genre and don't do much to detract from the tension. My biggest gripe is the design of the Creeper himself -- fully revealed, he is ugly but nothing you haven't seen trading barbs with Patrick Stewart on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" ; and the movie ends so abruptly and brutally that my initial reaction was that somebody had forgotten to put the last half hour in. But better an abrupt ending than a predicatble one, right? Simply put, ""Jeepers Creepers"" was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that actually creeped me out.

679450,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B00005RHGK,Michael R Gates,"[1, 2]","One of the best things about JEEPERS CREEPERS is the on-screen interaction between the brother and sister characters played respectively by Justin Long and Gina Philips. Like regular teenagers, they sardonically bicker, tease, and pick at each other when things start out, but when faced with a life-threatening crisis, the genuine love and respect that they have for each other shines through.  In fact, so genuine are their performances that, after watching the film, it is difficult to accept the fact that the two actors are not actually siblings.  Hopefully these excellent young performers will go on to even greater stardom as their talents mature and they fine-tune their art.But the two young stars aren't the ONLY good thing about this movie.  No siree!  With JEEPERS CREEPERS, writer/director Victor Salva has pulled out nearly all the stops to craft an enjoyable old-fashioned spook-show.  Most of the action takes place in a rural setting during what appears to be early fall, and this creates a very eerie and unsettling atmosphere that harkens back to Tobe Hooper's THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE.  In fact, aficionados of the genre will no doubt notice that JEEPERS CREEPERS is replete with nods to horror greats from the cinema past, including not only Hooper's cult classic, but also such films as DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, PSYCHO, Spielberg's DUEL, HALLOWEEN, FRIDAY THE 13th,...and the list goes on and on.  In addition, Salva playfully and lovingly pokes fun at many horror clich&eacute;s--worn-out devices like the old dark house, the darkened tunnel, the urban legend, the barely audible warning from a dying victim, the phone call from a stranger, the warning from a psychic, and many more--yet he does so in clever and witty ways that add to the fun of the film and the logical progression of the story.What would an old-fashioned monster movie be without a monster?  And does JEEPERS CREEPERS ever have one!  Somewhat reptilian in appearance and extremely cunning and intelligent, it is of the coolest, creepiest monsters to hit the cinema since 1979's ALIEN (and its sequels).  Extendable and retractable facial appendages, a mouthful of sharp teeth, big fold-out bat-like wings--all this, and it sews, carves wood, and drives, too!  And in keeping with the nostalgic undertones of the rest of the film, this monster also has characteristics that are reminiscent of nasty cinema favorites from days gone by: DRACULA, the FRANKENSTEIN monster, THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, television's GARGOYLES (1972), the aforementioned titular ghoulie from ALIEN, and more contemporary monsters like Freddy, Jason, and even HANNIBAL the Cannibal.Filmgoers who enjoy the fun creep-shows of yesteryear will get a real kick out of JEEPERS CREEPERS, but it is also modern and hip enough that younger, less nostalgic genre fans should enjoy it, too.  The DVD from MGM is loaded with cool extras, not the least of which are a feature commentary from writer/director Salva, alternate openings and endings, and some interesting behind-the-scenes featurettes.

On one hand, the road is paved with values that can shape and change your life. On the other more mysterious and deadly hand, the road is filled with the worst thing of all, the unknown. ""Jeepers Creepers"" seems to capture that perfectly. Instead of coming to the unknown a la ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", the unknown comes to them. That's a scary thought...Justin Long and Gina Phillips as the two protagonists, Darry and Trish, are driving home to see the old family. Along the way, across barren terrain, they are daunted by an unusual, hollowed out truck that almost throws them from the road. It's only later down the road when they see it again, but by then, they're already a part of something much bigger.""Jeepers Creepers"" is by far one of the better horror films to have come out in the past ten years. There's something original and real in the whole mess. Victor Salva, the director, never tries to be overly stylistic and keeps the film simple. There are dark edges, but never too dark (i.e. Alex Proyas, David Fincher) and the film never sets a certain date, leaving the audience to feel very general about the whole thing. In a way, the film is a bit timeless.Story wise, Salva creates two great characters. Darry and Trish are perfect examples of young adults in any generation. Not to mention both Philips and Long play them very well with such chemistry too. I like how it's a brother and sister ordeal and not the usual boyfriend and girlfriend motif that's been outdone in horror films, especially for the past twenty years. There's a lot going for it.

I'll just tell you what I liked/disliked about ""Jeepers Creepers,"" give you a conclusion and let you make up your own mind.The Good: The first 30-45 minutes or so of ""Jeepers Creepers"" are excellent. Unlike many horror film directors, Salva has the restraint to slowly build a truly creepy atmosphere and introduces characters -- siblings Trish and Darry -- who are even more stupid than your average horror protagonists but at least come across as actual human beings and not just cannon fodder. Even when they did something stupid (about every 10 minutes by my count) I found myself rooting for them. Salva's direction is also very stylish, from the initial haunting shot of a car slowly, silently coming toward the camera from a deserted mid-West all the way through the well-choreographed action scenes. And finally, the art direction is very interesting. The style of car the protagonists drive and the desolate country settings add up to a sort of retro-50s, drive-in movie look that I liked.The Bad: Wow, does this movie fall apart fast. After spending nearly an hour showing remarkable restraint, introducing characters that we like and building a sense of dread in the audience, ""Jeepers Creepers"" spills all of its secrets and completely ruins what could've been one of the best horror films I've seen in years. What made the Creeper so frightening in the first part of the movie is that the audience doesn't know what the protagonists are up against. Once Salva reveals his (admittedly good-looking) creature from the black lagoon ripoff, ""Jeepers Creepers"" descends into incoherent self-parody and isn't frightening in the least.One particularly stupid move was to stick a psychic into the picture about midway in one of the most hamhanded information dumps I've ever seen. Here's a tip for all screenwriters: Never include a psychic in your movie if 1) He/she doesn't actually clarify anything, anyway and 2) the character has no effect whatsoever on the plot. Just plain stupid.Overall I'd like to give the movie 3 or more stars, just on direction and atmosphere alone. Salva obviously knows how to frame a shot and the beginning of the picture is excellent. But the script and the second half of the movie is so totally inept that I can't justify more than two stars; watching what could've been a great movie unravel was truly disappointing.",2,Atmospheric movie starts w. a bang; goes out w. a whimper,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,2448,"['Why', 'rehash', 'plot', 'when', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'read', 'editorial', 'reviews', 'many', 'user', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'just', 'tell', 'what', 'liked/disliked', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'give', 'conclusion', 'let', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind.The', 'Good', 'first', '30-45', 'minutes', 'so', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'are', 'excellent', 'many', 'horror', 'film', 'directors', 'Salva', 'restraint', 'slowly', 'build', 'truly', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'characters', 'siblings', 'Trish', 'Darry', 'who', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'stupid', 'average', 'horror', 'protagonists', 'least', 'come', 'actual', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'just', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'Even', 'when', 'did', 'something', 'stupid', '10', 'minutes', 'count', 'found', 'rooting', 'Salva', 'direction', 'also', 'very', 'stylish', 'initial', 'haunting', 'shot', 'car', 'slowly', 'silently', 'coming', 'camera', 'deserted', 'mid-West', 'way', 'well-choreographed', 'action', 'scenes', 'finally', 'art', 'direction', 'very', 'interesting', 'style', 'car', 'protagonists', 'drive', 'desolate', 'country', 'settings', 'add', 'up', 'sort', 'retro-50s', 'drive-in', 'movie', 'look', 'liked.The', 'Bad', 'Wow', 'movie', 'fall', 'apart', 'fast', 'spending', 'nearly', 'hour', 'showing', 'remarkable', 'restraint', 'introducing', 'characters', 'like', 'building', 'sense', 'dread', 'audience', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'secrets', 'completely', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'What', 'made', 'Creeper', 'frightening', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'audience', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'protagonists', 'are', 'up', 'Once', 'Salva', 'admittedly', 'good-looking', 'creature', 'black', 'lagoon', 'ripoff', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'incoherent', 'self-parody', ""n't"", 'frightening', 'least.One', 'particularly', 'stupid', 'move', 'was', 'stick', 'psychic', 'picture', 'midway', 'one', 'most', 'hamhanded', 'information', 'dumps', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Here', 'tip', 'screenwriters', 'Never', 'include', 'psychic', 'movie', '1', 'He/she', ""n't"", 'actually', 'clarify', 'anything', 'anyway', '2', 'character', 'effect', 'whatsoever', 'plot', 'Just', 'plain', 'stupid.Overall', ""'d"", 'like', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'more', 'stars', 'just', 'direction', 'atmosphere', 'alone', 'Salva', 'obviously', 'how', 'frame', 'shot', 'beginning', 'picture', 'excellent', 'script', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'so', 'totally', 'inept', 'ca', ""n't"", 'justify', 'more', 'two', 'stars', 'watching', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'unravel', 'was', 'truly', 'disappointing']",Jeepers Creepers

679470,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00005RHGK,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[0, 0]","This surprise hit perhaps shows that audiences have really been craving such basic horrror as what 'Jeepers Creepers' really is.  The story has two teenagers driving home from college only to encounter a huge van that tries to run them off the road.  Subsequent encounters prove it to be a flesh-eating demon that requires bodyparts to survive and needs something from the two teens.With movies such as this there are always pitfalls to go along with moments of ingenuity.  For the first half hour this plays very much like a traditional horror movie such as 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', thankfully devoid of irony and clever smirks; this is horror at its most basic.  Indeed, there's an awful lot of moments that will make you jump up in your seat.  Despite being highly traditional though, there are several moments of genuine surprise here.  When the van bears down on the two teens it's actually very scary and the chamber made from dead bodies really makes the flesh creep.However, once this threat is revealed as a demon a lot of the suspense rapidly disappears.  Although the special effects are impressive, nothing really takes away from the fact that what's been scaring the audience all this time has been an organ-harvesting demon.  Quite simply, this is silly, even if it is different.Thankfully the young teen actors are very good indeed, and manage to bounce off each other incredibly well in the early comic scenes that they share.  What 'Jeepers Creepers' proved was that audiences have tired of the same smug horrors which quickly followed the ground-breaking 'Scream'.  This is back-to-basics stuff and cleverly creeps its audience out with implication rather than gore.  It's definitely one to watch, if not only for the fact that it is so different from a lot of other modern horror out there.",4,Good suspense-builder,1018396800,"04 10, 2002",2002,1811,"['surprise', 'hit', 'perhaps', 'audiences', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'craving', 'such', 'basic', 'horrror', 'what', 'Creepers', 'really', 'story', 'two', 'teenagers', 'driving', 'home', 'college', 'only', 'encounter', 'huge', 'van', 'run', 'off', 'road', 'Subsequent', 'encounters', 'prove', 'be', 'flesh-eating', 'demon', 'bodyparts', 'survive', 'needs', 'something', 'two', 'teens.With', 'movies', 'such', 'are', 'always', 'pitfalls', 'go', 'along', 'moments', 'ingenuity', 'first', 'hour', 'very', 'much', 'traditional', 'horror', 'movie', 'such', ""'Texas"", 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'thankfully', 'devoid', 'irony', 'clever', 'smirks', 'horror', 'most', 'basic', 'Indeed', 'awful', 'lot', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'jump', 'up', 'seat', 'being', 'highly', 'traditional', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'genuine', 'surprise', 'here', 'When', 'van', 'down', 'two', 'teens', 'actually', 'very', 'scary', 'chamber', 'made', 'dead', 'bodies', 'really', 'flesh', 'creep.However', 'once', 'threat', 'revealed', 'demon', 'lot', 'suspense', 'rapidly', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'impressive', 'nothing', 'really', 'away', 'fact', 'what', 'been', 'scaring', 'audience', 'time', 'been', 'organ-harvesting', 'demon', 'Quite', 'simply', 'silly', 'even', 'different.Thankfully', 'young', 'teen', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'manage', 'bounce', 'off', 'other', 'incredibly', 'well', 'early', 'comic', 'scenes', 'share', 'What', 'Creepers', 'proved', 'was', 'audiences', 'have', 'tired', 'same', 'smug', 'horrors', 'quickly', 'followed', 'ground-breaking', ""'Scream"", 'back-to-basics', 'stuff', 'cleverly', 'creeps', 'audience', 'out', 'implication', 'rather', 'gore', 'definitely', 'one', 'watch', 'not', 'only', 'fact', 'so', 'different', 'lot', 'other', 'modern', 'horror', 'there']",Jeepers Creepers

While it's not a waste of time, if you missed it, your life would be none the poorer for it.  Executed with slightly more intelligence than usual, Jeepers Creepers does offer some fun.A brother and sister are traveling along a near-deserted highway when they are nearly run off the road by an old truck.  Later they see the truck near an abandoned church and see its owner dumping what appear to be bodies down a pipe.  The sister is smart enough to want to get away as far as possible (and notify the police in the process), but the brother wants to investigate, motivated by curiosity and a desire to save anyone who might still be alive.  What they find is far worse than they imagine.However, in an inversion of most of these horror films, the characters are actually at their greatest peril not when they stupidly head towards danger but rather when they intelligently go to safety.  Therefore, the more the brother and sister do what the viewer thinks is the right thing, the worse things actually get.This is pure monster movie.  There is little in the way of plot twists or deep characterization and no romance to speak of; on the other hand, there is a little bit of humor and some okay effects.

679482,A1TRWW665ACYQ3,B00005RHGK,n.m.,"[0, 2]","I don't particularly go for these teenage horror films that have been popping up ever since SCREAM came out. Now don't get me wrong, I like horror films, but my taste lies more in the vicinity of Dario Argento, George Romero, Clive Barker, and Luci Fulci. But I sat down to see JEEPERS CREEPERS with an open heart, and the film started out pretty good. The story goes as follows; The two siblings, Trish and Darry, are on their way home to visir their parents, on a college break, when they are suddenly harassed by an eerie looking old van, whilst driving along a deserted stretch of American highway. It's all very much like THE HITCHER. After a short while the van drives on and dissapears, until Trish and Darry comes across it again, this time parked in front of an abandoned church. As they drive by, they see a person dumping what appears to be bodies wrapped in white sheet into a pipe in the ground. Unfortunetaly, the person also spots Trish and Darry; Another car chase follows. Trish and Darry manages to escape again, but this time Darry gets the brilliant idea that they should backtrack and see if anybody needs help. Valiant, sure, but stupid. &quot;Haven't you watched enough horror movies?&quot; Trish asks Darry, and it's bad luck for Darry that he obviously hasn't, because we all know what Darry doesn't; Never, ever, under any circustance, go back... So far the film is fairly exciting. There's even some pretty nice camera work to behold. But it doesn't take long before the plot pretty much skyrockets off the face of the planet. Now this is okey if you can maintain credibility, but JEEPERS CREEPERS certainly can't. Things become ridiculous, and when stuff gets ridiculous they seize to be scary. I started out thinking that &quot;boy would this be creepy if it happened to me,&quot; and I ended up thinking &quot;what a totally awful film this is,&quot;",1,one of the year's worst films,1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,1880,"['do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'go', 'teenage', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'popping', 'up', 'ever', 'SCREAM', 'came', 'out', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'horror', 'films', 'taste', 'more', 'vicinity', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'George', 'Romero', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'Luci', 'Fulci', 'sat', 'down', 'see', 'JEEPERS', 'CREEPERS', 'open', 'heart', 'film', 'started', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'two', 'siblings', 'Trish', 'Darry', 'are', 'way', 'home', 'visir', 'parents', 'college', 'break', 'when', 'are', 'suddenly', 'harassed', 'eerie', 'looking', 'old', 'van', 'whilst', 'driving', 'along', 'deserted', 'stretch', 'American', 'highway', 'very', 'much', 'HITCHER', 'short', 'van', 'dissapears', 'Trish', 'Darry', 'again', 'time', 'parked', 'front', 'abandoned', 'church', 'drive', 'see', 'person', 'dumping', 'what', 'be', 'bodies', 'wrapped', 'white', 'sheet', 'pipe', 'ground', 'Unfortunetaly', 'person', 'also', 'spots', 'Trish', 'Darry', 'car', 'chase', 'Trish', 'Darry', 'escape', 'again', 'time', 'Darry', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'should', 'backtrack', 'see', 'anybody', 'help', 'Valiant', 'sure', 'stupid', 'quot', 'Have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'enough', 'horror', 'movies', 'quot', 'Trish', 'Darry', 'bad', 'luck', 'Darry', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Darry', ""n't"", 'Never', 'ever', 'circustance', 'go', 'back', 'So', 'far', 'film', 'fairly', 'exciting', 'even', 'pretty', 'nice', 'camera', 'work', 'behold', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'skyrockets', 'face', 'planet', 'Now', 'okey', 'can', 'maintain', 'credibility', 'JEEPERS', 'CREEPERS', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Things', 'become', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'stuff', 'ridiculous', 'seize', 'be', 'scary', 'started', 'out', 'thinking', 'quot', 'would', 'be', 'creepy', 'happened', 'quot', 'ended', 'up', 'thinking', 'quot', 'what', 'totally', 'awful', 'film', 'quot']",Jeepers Creepers

What they find is a horrific surprise. But even after they flee in terror from the hellish scene, the mysterious man catches up with them. They soon find themselves out in the middle of nowhere with their only company as a few locals and the baffled small-town police. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Before long, they discover the vicious predator isn't even human. And, to put the icing on the dreadful cake, the answers of why it is here and what it wants are revealed!Few modern-day horror films include original, interesting, and iconic monsters. Well, Jeepers Creepers does! Although a superb cast and talented crew contribute to the greatness, the best part about it is the creature itself. Despite a few scenes (that are actually so realistic you can't tell CGI is used), the monster is the product of a very believeable full-body-suit, not cheap computer tricks. Before the inhuman identity is revealed of The Creeper, it's wardrobe is eye-poppingly awesome. Like the darkest of the darkest superheros, his long trench-coat flaps in the wind and his rugged hat shades his evil face. Like some kind of demon-cowboy, he's intimidating to the characters, yet mesmerizing to the audience. Eventually, of course, the clothing comes off and one hell of a creature is presented. I won't give a description of that -- you've got to see it for yourself. All I can say is that monster fans will not be disappointed!In short conclusion, this is a great comeback for the old-fashioned creature flicks. It's not very scary, but it's a whole lot of fun!

Along the way they have a nasty altercation with a large black truck, and that starts a chain of devastating events with a highway murderer, out for their blood and refusing to let go.On so, so many levels this movie works better than most other contemporary horror movies. Hithero-unknown actors Phillips and Long prove themselves to be excellent actors, creating genuinely tense atmosphere and credible emotion in their roles. Direction, too, is excellent, with the hazy, summertime country highway vistas contrasing violently and to great effect with the chaos and noise of the Creeper and his truck. The images of the Murderer as a tall, all-in-black stranger work so very well - he's a genuinely scary character, an imposing figure straight out of a nightmare. The sense of isolation and tension created by director Victor Salva are strong, and give this movie the bulk of its strength.Shame, then, that the ending is effectively ruined by a predictable, unscary cliche involving the supernatural and a fat psychic.

No idea why. This is one of the better horror movies to come out of Hollywood in quite a while, and Victor Salva has finally lived up to the promise that's kept Hollywood allowing him to make bad movies on a fairly  regular basis for the past decade and a half.The story opens with a brother and sister team, Derry (Justin Long, from the TV series Ed) and Trish (Gina Phillips, who recently had a turn on Boston  Public and shows up next year in The Anarchist's Cookbook), driving across the state on their way home from college for spring break. On a secluded stretch of highway, a strange truck menaces them before roaring past. A few miles  down the road, they see the truck's driver dumping something that looks suspiciously like a body wrapped in a sheet down a large pipe, and after he drives away they stop to investigate. Complications ensue.The movie's probably not going to win any awards for its acting, writing, or cinematography, all of which fall into the slightly-above-average category.  But then, this isn't a movie with Oscar aspirations anyway. It's supposed to be a fast-paced slick little horror film, and that's what it is. Salva achieves the right balance between showing the nastiness and cutting away to let  suggestion do the work, and also uses the suggestion technique with his bad guy most of the time (something that hasn't been seen too much in films for a while). Add in a Miss Cleo-esque psychic (Patricia Belcher), a few hick cops who  actually break stereotype a few times, and a fun bad guy (Jonathan Breck, from the painfully bad film Spiders), and you've got a fine little flick. *** ",4,"Surprisingly good, given negative press.",1014681600,"02 26, 2002",2002,1821,"['Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'Victor', 'Salva', '2001', 'think', 'arguable', 'exception', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'negative', 'press', 'movie', 'past', 'decade', 'did', 'one', 'idea', 'why', 'one', 'better', 'horror', 'movies', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'quite', 'while', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'finally', 'lived', 'up', 'promise', 'kept', 'Hollywood', 'allowing', 'make', 'bad', 'movies', 'fairly', 'regular', 'basis', 'past', 'decade', 'half.The', 'story', 'brother', 'sister', 'team', 'Derry', 'Justin', 'Long', 'TV', 'series', 'Ed', 'Trish', 'Gina', 'Phillips', 'who', 'recently', 'had', 'turn', 'Boston', 'Public', 'up', 'next', 'year', 'Anarchist', 'Cookbook', 'driving', 'state', 'way', 'home', 'college', 'spring', 'break', 'secluded', 'stretch', 'highway', 'strange', 'truck', 'menaces', 'roaring', 'past', 'few', 'miles', 'down', 'road', 'see', 'truck', 'driver', 'dumping', 'something', 'suspiciously', 'body', 'wrapped', 'sheet', 'down', 'large', 'pipe', 'away', 'stop', 'investigate', 'Complications', 'ensue.The', 'movie', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'awards', 'acting', 'writing', 'cinematography', 'fall', 'slightly-above-average', 'category', 'then', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Oscar', 'aspirations', 'anyway', 'supposed', 'be', 'fast-paced', 'slick', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'what', 'Salva', 'right', 'balance', 'showing', 'nastiness', 'cutting', 'away', 'let', 'suggestion', 'do', 'work', 'also', 'suggestion', 'technique', 'bad', 'guy', 'most', 'time', 'something', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'too', 'much', 'films', 'while', 'Add', 'Miss', 'Cleo-esque', 'psychic', 'Patricia', 'Belcher', 'few', 'hick', 'cops', 'who', 'actually', 'break', 'stereotype', 'few', 'times', 'fun', 'bad', 'guy', 'Jonathan', 'Breck', 'painfully', 'bad', 'film', 'Spiders', ""'ve"", 'got', 'fine', 'little', 'flick', '***']",Jeepers Creepers

But the reviews on this looked good, so, since my other half was out of town (she won't go to these) I thought I'd break my rules (don't spend money on horror flicks) and check it out. I should have followed the rules. This seemed very VERY formulaic to me. The beginning was cast from a worn out mold. The monster was low budget, the scary scenes didn't rev my motor and I kept waiting for some good sounds to bring the scary parts to life. On the other hand, I have a feeling that my 17 year old son, who loves this kind of flick would enjoy it, perhaps precisely for the same reasons I found it disappointing. I do like good fantasy and science fiction stories, creatively done. But I just didn't see much creativity in this one.

679511,ADKA2MJQQCMTO,B00005RHGK,Ron Sullivan,"[3, 8]","I was wandering around the mall a few days ago with nothing to do, so I figured I'd treat myself to a movie.  I was actually looking to see Final Fantasy, but it turns out it was no longer playing.  Simply on a whim, as a replacement, I decided to go see 'Jeepers Creepers.'  Man what a disappointment.My first groan came when I learned it was a Victor Salva film.  Salva, you may remember, is the convicted child-molester who had made the movie 'Powder.' I swore I'd never pay to see one of his movies and I was kicking myself when I realized my mistake.My second error came relative to the plot.  Granted this is my own fault, I was told by a friend, the plot of the movie was similar to the Shirley Jackson story of 'The Lottery' where a town is sacrificing people to this demon that lived in a hole under a church.That half-heard assessment turned out to also only be about half-right.  I won&#65533;t rehash the plot completely, but in this movie, the townspeople are unaware of the demon (in the beginning that is).The plot, to me anyway, never really seemed to come together.  It seemed as if there were several points that it tried to make, and then just gave up on.  For example, why after the demon took whatever body part he needed, did he stitch all the corpses back up and together?  What was the idea behind making a point of the dead interracial couple? I thought it was going to be a murder mystery for a few moments after that.  Why did he even have a hole to the old church when he could have just walked down into the basement?  What the hell was with the woman with all the cats?  What was with all the crows everywhere?  Did they work for the Creeper or something?  Things like this just seemed to keep piling up to the point that I wasn't really enjoying the movie anymore.  It just seemed to be all over the place.I don't know, I was admittedly really never into gore/horror movies very much.

They calm down and proceed down the road. As they pass an abandoned church, they see the old truck and a cloaked figure throwing a body-sized package down a large pipe. Darry is intrigued and makes them go back. A decision that he soon regrets as their relaxing country drive deteriorates into a nightmare of unimaginable horror.My Opinion:  I liked JC and found it to be entertaining. Sure it has some plot holes and fits easily into the teen horror genre, but isn't that what you wanted if you are renting or buying this movie? I liked the brother sister twist. Usually you have the boyfriend girl friend thing going on. Here we have a stronger sibling bond. It makes for some different points of view and situations. I thought Justin Long did a great job. I like him on the Ed TV show and it was cool to see him here. Gina Philips was also pretty good and she wasn't bad to look at. The Creeper was a cool character. They gave him a reason for what he did. There is also a bit of subterfuge as to what the Creeper is really after. When we find out what he really is I was a bit disappointed, but I got over it. In the end I was entertained and glad I rented it.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1  Sound: DD5.1  Extras: Multiple Making of featurettes, Deleted and Extended Scenes, Commentary, Trailer, Photo Gallery, Hidden Features  Menus: They change when you click the correct option!What You Should Do:  See this if you are a horror movie buff.

It was very disturbing and scary and it was the kind of film that would give you nightmares. The movie had a great look (the ""middle of nowhere in heartland America look"" that was made popular in great horror classics like Night of the living dead,) that made it very creepy. The movie also had believable characters and intelligent dialogue and good acting. The monster is not very scary looking but he is terrifying because he does horrible unspeakably gruesome things to his victims. (The things he does to his victims would freak Hannibal Lecter out.) I think he is the scariest horror villain that I have seen in years and he reminds me of the old classic american Urban legend boogeyman stories. I also enjoyed how some things were left unexplained and I enjoyed the unhappy ending that didn't follow the popular monster movie genre. (I won't give anything away but I will say that things don't end well for one of the heroes and the monster doesn't even come close to being destroyed.) I also enjoyed the old creepy 1940's (or 1950's, I'm not sure,) music that was used. (Jeepers Creepers and another old song about the boogeyman.) This film will disturb and horrify you if you see it.

It seemed as if this one would be different from your usual slasher stuff, I really expected to see a piece of psychological horror. But it's not. I was so dissapointed when I left the cinema. Though not very original (it reminded me very often of ""Duell"" and ""Joyride""), the movie began quite promising, there are some witty dialogues, and you get to know the two protagonists better than it's usual for scary movies, Gina Phillips's and Justin Long's acting was also good. But that's only the first half of the trip. After some great (really great!) psychological shock moments, you get to see the villain and after seeing him it all gets very ridiculous, it seemed to me as if I'm seeing a really bad unaired episode of ""Buffy-The Vampire Slayer"". The atmosphere of silent terror gets destroyed by this cheap, cheap, cheap monster make up. It's the most ridiculous monster I've ever seen. It's not scary at all! And so is the ending, though it's surprisingly pessimistic, it's not satisfying at all. The movie just stops...the ending just doesn't feel right. I don't have anything against pessimistic and shocking endings, but hello! This ending just looked like they had not enough money to bring the movie to an end!Though all in all disappointing, this movie is worth a watch (rent it first), the first half is one of the finest in modern teen horror history.

679526,A2U7DXDNYBBLQJ,B00005RHGK,"Shane Windham ""Shane Windham, author""","[1, 1]","One thing I will definitely say about this film is that it can be as unnerving as any great horror flick. And it will definitely be difficult to forget once you've watched it all the way through. This is mostly due to its fairly original plot. What I assumed was going to be a slasher film went places I wasn't expecting. And I thought that, overall, that alone was rather refreshing.Having made that clear, it is only fair that I give the cons alongside the pros. Most horror films prey upon the fear of our own mortality, or even just on the idea of being tortured, disfigured, etc. This movie is no exception, but it becomes clear pretty quickly that the writers here were more interested in the creation of their monster and putting certain effects on screen than they were with regard to realism. What I mean is that the dialogue is pretty predictable, and you will continually see characters doing things almost no one would do, for the sake of furthering the plot through to the end. It's almost as though no one cared much about plot-holes here or even (more importantly) the creation of realistic interaction.But then, this is horror. And, true to form, I should almost always know better than to expect reasonable action on the part of the victims. But in a genre which thrives on our own fears, it is pretty much a given that the more realistic the premise and the more believable the characters, the more terrifying the experience is. And that is where this film falls short. Otherwise it's a decent way to waste a few hours. You'll probably appreciate the visual roller-coaster and all of the shock value which are entailed in Jeepers Creepers.Not the best, but certainly not the worst.",3,"Unique premise, Often cheesy execution",1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,1699,"['One', 'thing', 'will', 'definitely', 'say', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'unnerving', 'great', 'horror', 'flick', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'difficult', 'forget', 'once', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'way', 'mostly', 'due', 'fairly', 'original', 'plot', 'What', 'assumed', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'slasher', 'film', 'went', 'places', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'thought', 'overall', 'alone', 'was', 'rather', 'refreshing.Having', 'made', 'clear', 'only', 'fair', 'give', 'cons', 'pros', 'Most', 'horror', 'films', 'prey', 'fear', 'own', 'mortality', 'even', 'just', 'idea', 'being', 'tortured', 'disfigured', 'etc', 'movie', 'exception', 'clear', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'writers', 'here', 'were', 'more', 'interested', 'creation', 'monster', 'putting', 'certain', 'effects', 'screen', 'were', 'regard', 'realism', 'What', 'mean', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'will', 'continually', 'see', 'characters', 'doing', 'things', 'almost', 'one', 'would', 'do', 'sake', 'furthering', 'plot', 'end', 'almost', 'one', 'cared', 'much', 'plot-holes', 'here', 'even', 'more', 'importantly', 'creation', 'realistic', 'interaction.But', 'then', 'horror', 'true', 'form', 'should', 'almost', 'always', 'know', 'better', 'expect', 'reasonable', 'action', 'part', 'victims', 'genre', 'own', 'fears', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'more', 'realistic', 'premise', 'more', 'believable', 'characters', 'more', 'terrifying', 'experience', 'where', 'film', 'short', 'Otherwise', 'decent', 'way', 'waste', 'few', 'hours', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'appreciate', 'visual', 'roller-coaster', 'shock', 'value', 'are', 'entailed', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers.Not', 'best', 'certainly', 'not', 'worst']",Jeepers Creepers

I, and other movie goers, jumped out of my seat several times.  I had to move to the back of the theater with my back against the wall to avoid those irritating late attendees walking up behind me and startling me while watching the movie!  (And people, pleeeeease get a clue and leave your cell phones and crying babies at home!!!).  Even though there were scenes where you wanted to scream out ""get out of there dummies!"" to the brother and sister, there were still many scary scenes.  I agree with some reviewers that the psychic was just a waste of time, and would also like to know where the creeper came from, but it was a fun movie regardless; not in the true sense of the word ""fun,"" but fun as is getting to be scared.  I haven't been scared since the original Nightmare on Elm Street came out at theaters in 1984.  When I and other people came out of Jeepers (JC), several of us jumped when turning a corner in the theater hallway and there was a dark luminous shadow on the wall which happened to be just a shadow from the drinking fountain...Immediately after Jeepers, I went over to see Rock Star thinking it would get JC off my mind; talk about scary...go see Rock Star.  Anyway, while leaving the theater, I kept thinking I heard footsteps behind me and with the creeper on my mind, I ran to my car.  I can't wait to see it again and buy it on DVD!  I'm going to drag my husband (he's scared silly of horror movies) and my teen son to see it too.

679536,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B00005RHGK,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[1, 5]","Let me tell you folks, this is the most difficult review I've ever written.  Why?  Personal politics about director Victor Salva.  I won't rehash the reasons since so many reviews here tell the story, but let it be said that I feel he's a detestable human being.  But I'm trying to put those feelings aside(it's difficult though) and just review the film itself.  After all, I learned to do it with Woody Allen's films.  Most of the bad reviews of this film are bashing it for all the wrong reasons.  They're most likely written by &quot;Scream&quot; generation horror fans looking for the same kind of thing.  Well, in Jeepers Creepers you won't be getting that, but instead a throwback to the 70s/80s school of bizarre, grindhouse horror flicks.  Very much like the style of Rob Zombie's House of 1,000 Corpses.  This style is more appreciated by the fans of obscure horror films of glory days past.  I'm not defending Jeepers Creepers 100% coz it certainly has it's flaws.  The biggest flaw is an overdose of the &quot;Creeper.&quot;  It was much more effective to see him from a distance in his attire.  Even as we get closer to him and see what he looks like, it still isn't bad.  Once he sheds his clothes, revealing a silvery, bird-like body, he ceases to be the least bit mysterious or creepy from then on.  They should have kept it simple.  Simplicity with this kind of formula works wonders.  Yes, I agree the main characters are annoying.  The frightened expression that the leading man wears throughout 90% of the film is fake looking and comical.  Reviewers bash this coz all their questions regarding the monster weren't answered.  Does everybody need explanations spoon fed to them?  I thought horror lied within what we don't fully understand;  The unknown.  The current trend in horror films is to have an explanation for EVERYTHING!  That's why older horror films are so much better.  A director had a crazy idea and went with it.  Many classics were made this way.  No one liked the ending.  I don't think the ending could have been any better.  Hero dies and monster gets away.  That's the way a horror film should end if you ask me.  Why make it fluffy and Disney?  Doesn't really belong in horror.  If you want that kind of closure, watch a romance film or a Bruckheimer action flick.  Basically three stars is the best route to go considering it's pretty much Even Steven.  I will say that when you avoid the personal politics, this film does entertain quite well in that nostalgic, midnight &quot;B&quot; movie way.",3,A Tough Movie To Review,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,2539,"['Let', 'tell', 'folks', 'most', 'difficult', 'review', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'written', 'Why', 'Personal', 'politics', 'director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'reasons', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'tell', 'story', 'let', 'be', 'said', 'feel', 'detestable', 'human', 'being', ""'m"", 'trying', 'put', 'feelings', 'aside', 'difficult', 'just', 'review', 'film', 'learned', 'do', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'Most', 'bad', 'reviews', 'film', 'are', 'bashing', 'wrong', 'reasons', ""'re"", 'most', 'likely', 'written', 'quot', 'Scream', 'quot', 'generation', 'horror', 'fans', 'looking', 'same', 'kind', 'thing', 'Well', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'instead', 'throwback', '70s/80s', 'school', 'bizarre', 'grindhouse', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Very', 'much', 'style', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'House', '1,000', 'Corpses', 'style', 'more', 'appreciated', 'fans', 'obscure', 'horror', 'films', 'glory', 'days', ""'m"", 'not', 'defending', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '100', '%', 'coz', 'certainly', 'flaws', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'overdose', 'quot', 'Creeper.', 'quot', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'see', 'distance', 'attire', 'Even', 'get', 'closer', 'see', 'what', 'still', ""n't"", 'bad', 'clothes', 'revealing', 'silvery', 'bird-like', 'body', 'be', 'least', 'bit', 'mysterious', 'creepy', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'simple', 'Simplicity', 'kind', 'formula', 'wonders', 'Yes', 'agree', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'annoying', 'frightened', 'expression', 'leading', 'man', '90', '%', 'film', 'fake', 'looking', 'comical', 'Reviewers', 'bash', 'coz', 'questions', 'regarding', 'monster', 'were', ""n't"", 'answered', 'Does', 'everybody', 'need', 'explanations', 'spoon', 'fed', 'thought', 'horror', 'lied', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'unknown', 'current', 'trend', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'explanation', 'EVERYTHING', 'why', 'older', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'A', 'director', 'had', 'crazy', 'idea', 'went', 'Many', 'classics', 'were', 'made', 'way', 'one', 'liked', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Hero', 'dies', 'monster', 'away', 'way', 'horror', 'film', 'should', 'end', 'ask', 'Why', 'make', 'fluffy', 'Disney', ""n't"", 'really', 'belong', 'horror', 'want', 'kind', 'closure', 'watch', 'romance', 'film', 'Bruckheimer', 'action', 'flick', 'Basically', 'three', 'stars', 'best', 'route', 'go', 'considering', 'pretty', 'much', 'Even', 'Steven', 'will', 'say', 'when', 'avoid', 'personal', 'politics', 'film', 'entertain', 'quite', 'well', 'nostalgic', 'midnight', 'quot', 'B', 'quot', 'movie', 'way']",Jeepers Creepers

If you like movies with no plots or character development, espically about the lead character then Jeepers Creepers is right up your alley. The movie actually starts off very cool. A brother and sister are on a highway out in the middle of no where, when some maniac tries to run them off the road. They come across this maniac a few minutes later stuffing a body down a sewer pipe, and then they decide to go and check out the scene. What awaits at the bottom of the pipe is creepy indeed, and I thought that this was going to be one hell of a movie. But I was tricked and fooled, because in the next hour, the movie goes from looking like its going to be a sick and twisted thriller to a laughing stock. IF you have seen the movie, read ahead, as they are SPOILERS listed below. IF you havent seen the movie, read anyway, so you can save yourself an hour and a half of your life doing something more productive, like watching the grass grow. Here is a list of what is completely wrong with this movie.1.When the teens reach the diner, they get a strange call from a women who knows both their names. It is later reveled that this women is a pyschic who can predict the future through her dreams. She explains that the teens will be at a house later full of cats, and when they here the songs ""Jeepers Creepers"" to watch out. OK, this is completly stupid. If the women wanted to warn the teens they were in trouble, she should have explained who she was (which she never revels on the phone) and told them they were in great danger and to get out of town. Case closed.2.When the killer is finally reveled he looks he a stupid demon with wings. He looks like the goblin from Spider Man....Ughhh3.When the women (the pyschic) finally reaches the teen at the police station, she revels who she is, what she sees, and a brief, story, that makes no sense of who this demon is. This is what really kills the movie since we really have no idea of who the demon is and what is his motives about why he kills are. Instead we get some garbage story about how he feeds on humans to stay alive. Sounds like a vampire to me.4.THE ENDING SUCKS...The demon is in his sewer pipe listening to Jeepers Creepers and there is one of the teens (the guy) standing there with it seems like the life is sucked out of him. It looks like a cardboard cut out with the eye missing and then the demon pears through the eye, and fade to black, movie over. I am sitting here puzzled as I just watched a movie that gave me nothing about the identity of the killer, expect it likes to feed on humans..Wonderful. I have seen low budget B-Horror movie that were better then this, and yes I mean slasher films that have more plot then this. Avoid this movie. You arent missing anything here.

Tucker,"[2, 2]","I think what makes all of the old Universal horror films so timeless is that at the time they were released, there was nothing else like them. Think about it.When Bela Lugosi donned his cape in Dracula, vampires were still a new concept to American audiences.  What was a werewolf, if not some old European folk tale?  Who had ever pieced dead bodies together and brought them back to life before Frankenstein did it?  Jeepers Creepers introduces a new monster.  One that kills and consumes to regenerate itself.  If we have seen this before, it was just in nibbles and sniffs.  This movie is an eyes-open full-blown look into the face of a new creature in our monster pantheon.Jeepers Creepers was born in the late 1990's, early 2000's, when Wes Craven and his Scream franchise had rejuvinated the killer-with-a-knife formula that was started as far back as Psycho, distilled in the Texas Chainsaw massacre, and refined for the masses in Halloween and Friday the 13th.  The previews for Jeepers Creepers sure give the impression of yet another tale of pouty, posturing teens stalked by a masked avenger with a knife who wants to punish them for their sexual transgressions.In reality, what Jeepers Creepers delivers is a throwback to the days when a monster was a monster and there were things moving in the dark.I just finished watching this film for the fourth time about 10 minutes ago and I realize there are some glaring holes in the story (i.e. how does a monster go to the DMV office and get personailized plates AND somehow get the lettering to be uneven and jumbled in a ""crazy"" way?).If you read my other reviews, you will notice I watch a lot of horror films.  If you enjoy horror films also, then there is one thing you probably already know.. do not expect perfect continuity.  If you watch an historical drama, then I guess you expect accuracy and continuity.  In horror films, that isn't the case.To enjoy a horror film, I expect a few things.  First, take me some place where I am uncomfortable.  Make me question my safety.  Make me feel that no matter what I do, I am going to meet with a gruesome end.Jeepers Creepers introduces us to the ""Creeper"", a new addition to the pantheon of classic horror figures.  The entire story takes place during one fateful afternoon/evening, along a country road in (place you favorite southern state name here).  It is hot.  The characters are sweaty and you can almost smell them.  The Creeper certainly can.The Amazon review tells most of the secrets of the film.  If you are reading this, then what you really want to know is ""why should I watch this movie?  Well, all I can offer is that it is different.  If you want a good, old fashioned monster flick, then by God you came to the right place.i would give this film 5 stars but there are those nasty plot holes, plus director Victor Salva was busted for ""certain"" crimes which I must protest.

In fact, it does it so well that the good parts of the movie, including a nice room coated in mutilated corpses, seem to drag a bit. As I watched on, all I wanted to know was now long it would take to start the car this time, and when the main characters were going to die. O, how I hoped for their deaths.This brings me to my second problem, the characters. Normally, I enjoy meeting the characters of a movie so I can feel their pain vicariously. Normally, but not this time. Even in movies where I wished for the characters to start dropping like flies, I don't usually think this because of the quality of the actor or because of the predicability of their reactions. To understand them, think ""stupider than even a believable horror victim"" and you've got yourself a role.Thirdly, the plot was a mind-numbing sleeper that simply didn't cut it. Now, I'm not insulting the flesh-eating ""demon"" part or some of his handiwork, but the Jeepers Creepers insertions, the ""psychic"" that warns us of these, or the ""it drives a scary truck and has your scent, so you'll never be safe"" pinnacle the horror structured around was a bit too much for me.All this said, there were still a few, scantly numbered, memorable parts in the film.

679560,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005RHGK,trebe,"[1, 1]","Writer/director Victor Salva's did intend to launch a monster franchise, but that's how things worked out, as his scary thriller Jeepers Creepers (2001), was successful enough to spawn the high action sequel Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003), and the third entry in the series Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral, is reportedly in production at this time.The strange being known as ""The Creeper"" (Jonathan Breck), is tremendously powerful, and has the ability to fly.  He surfaces every twenty three years, and for a period of twenty three days, driven his sense of smell, he consumes humans for their body parts.  Siblings Trish (Gina Philips) and Darry Jenner (Justin Long) are travelling in Florida, when they cross the path of the Creeper's vehicle.  Later, passing an abandoned church, they again spot the Creepermobile, and observe a huge figure, grabbing body shaped bundles from the back, and tossing them down a corrugated pipe in the ground.  The Creepermobile suddenly appears behind them, and runs them off the road.  Going back to the church to investigate, Darry makes a horrific discovery in an underground cavern.Daylight turns to darkness, while the pair awaits for police assistance.  Darry gets a phone call from a mysterious woman who warns him that something bad will happen, when he hears the song Jeepers Creepers.  The action ramps up when the Creeper gets Darry's scent, and will stop at nothing to satisfy his needs.With lots of intimate dialog, Salva does a wonderful job of making the relationship between Trish and Darry, seem very real and natural.  It is the central thread that holds the film together, and both Justin Long (Live Free, Die Hard) and Gina Philips (Ally McBeal) turn in strong performances.  Long goes overboard at times, but that is kind of what he does.  Philips was 31 at the time, but easily passes for much younger.The suspense is sustained, by keeping the Creeper obscured for most of the film.  Psychic Jezelle Gay Hartman (Patricia Belcher) provides key information about the creature, and a deadly prediction.  The ending is a bit unexpected, but remains true to Salva's vision.  Jeepers Creepers has its faults, but is still a well-crafted, and very effective monster movie.The double sided DVD release, is a comprehensive package, including both widescreen and full screen versions of the film, and lots of cool bonus materials.  Victor Salva, a longtime horror aficionado, provides a fun and informative commentary track, and there are also an excellent series of featurettes covering the making of the film.  Unfortunately, nothing is heard from executive producer Francis Ford Coppola.  If you like creepy monsters, check out this series, as Jeepers Creepers 2, picks up where the first film left off, delivering big time action.  Gina Philips will reprise her role as Trish, in the upcoming third entry in the series, Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral.",4,"Trish and the Creeper, will be back in Jeepers Creepers 3 . . .",1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,2896,"['Writer/director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'did', 'intend', 'launch', 'monster', 'franchise', 'how', 'things', 'worked', 'out', 'scary', 'thriller', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2001', 'was', 'successful', 'enough', 'spawn', 'high', 'action', 'sequel', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', '2003', 'third', 'entry', 'series', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '3', 'Cathedral', 'reportedly', 'production', 'time.The', 'strange', 'being', 'known', 'Creeper', 'Jonathan', 'Breck', 'tremendously', 'powerful', 'ability', 'fly', 'twenty', 'three', 'years', 'period', 'twenty', 'three', 'days', 'driven', 'sense', 'smell', 'humans', 'body', 'parts', 'Siblings', 'Trish', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'Darry', 'Jenner', 'Justin', 'Long', 'are', 'travelling', 'Florida', 'when', 'cross', 'path', 'Creeper', 'vehicle', 'Later', 'passing', 'abandoned', 'church', 'again', 'spot', 'Creepermobile', 'huge', 'figure', 'grabbing', 'body', 'shaped', 'bundles', 'back', 'tossing', 'down', 'corrugated', 'pipe', 'ground', 'Creepermobile', 'suddenly', 'off', 'road', 'Going', 'back', 'church', 'investigate', 'Darry', 'horrific', 'discovery', 'underground', 'cavern.Daylight', 'darkness', 'pair', 'police', 'assistance', 'Darry', 'phone', 'call', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'something', 'bad', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'song', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'action', 'up', 'when', 'Creeper', 'Darry', 'scent', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'satisfy', 'needs.With', 'lots', 'intimate', 'dialog', 'Salva', 'wonderful', 'job', 'making', 'relationship', 'Trish', 'Darry', 'seem', 'very', 'real', 'natural', 'central', 'thread', 'film', 'together', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'turn', 'strong', 'performances', 'Long', 'overboard', 'times', 'kind', 'what', 'Philips', 'was', '31', 'time', 'easily', 'much', 'younger.The', 'suspense', 'sustained', 'keeping', 'Creeper', 'obscured', 'most', 'film', 'Psychic', 'Jezelle', 'Gay', 'Hartman', 'Patricia', 'Belcher', 'key', 'information', 'creature', 'deadly', 'prediction', 'ending', 'bit', 'unexpected', 'true', 'Salva', 'vision', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'faults', 'still', 'well-crafted', 'very', 'effective', 'monster', 'movie.The', 'double', 'sided', 'DVD', 'release', 'comprehensive', 'package', 'including', 'widescreen', 'full', 'screen', 'versions', 'film', 'lots', 'cool', 'bonus', 'materials', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'longtime', 'horror', 'aficionado', 'fun', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'series', 'featurettes', 'covering', 'making', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'nothing', 'heard', 'executive', 'producer', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'like', 'creepy', 'monsters', 'check', 'out', 'series', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'film', 'left', 'off', 'delivering', 'big', 'time', 'action', 'Gina', 'Philips', 'will', 'reprise', 'role', 'Trish', 'upcoming', 'third', 'entry', 'series', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '3', 'Cathedral']",Jeepers Creepers

The banter between the brother and sister was great, and rather realistic and other than the profanity reminded me of conversations I have had on long drives. The way one sees the Winnebago turn a corner in the backseat window and the BEATNU truck suddenly come up behind the sibling pair is a classic piece of cinematography. The way the film continues to build up with some more DUEL-type suspense is great. However, once the brother and sister check out the pipe behind the old church, the film starts to fall apart.The movie slows down a lot after that and I found myself fastforward viewing through the slowest moments. A lot of elements are introduced to the story that have little bearing on the plot. And the song, what in the world does the song Jeepers Creepers have to do with the movie? Nothing as far as I could tell.The Creeper itself may not have been that impressive of a monster. However, I found it nice for once to have a horror movie where the horror was a real monster. Unfortunately, this monster is indestructible. That makes the film rather disappointing. What's the point in fighting a battle (or watching a movie) where nothing, absolutely nothing, can be gained? I mean, come on, even Superman has kryptonite and demons can be exorcised; every creature has to have some weakness. But apparently, the Creeper doesn't.

It's your typical horror movie that has a script any 8-year-old could follow, and mediocre acting.When I rented Jeepers Creepers, I had in mind that I was going to get exactly the opposite of that.  I was let on to believe that it was going to be terrifying.  It wasn't.The first 30 minutes gave me some hope though.  The Creep, as I like to call the monster, played a crazed maniac in an old, unexpectedly powerful vehicle that tries and run the main characters off the road.  It was fresh and very entertaining.  But, after all that was done, and the Creep made his first appearance in costume, the film spiraled down hill.The one problem I have with most horror films these days is that they are overloaded with cliches.  And Jeepers Creepers was beyond overloaded with them.  There were your typical stupid main characters that do their stupid things and say those stupid lines.  Nobody in their right mind would even consider doing some of things they did.And the believability of some parts was stretching it a bit.  Would a county in the middle of no where have a police force the size of Manhattan?  I don't think so.  Things like that just really took its toll on the movie.Jeepers Creepers really wasn't a terrible film, but it took on all the features that it was expected to in a horror movie.[...].  3 Stars",3,No need to peep at this one,1011484800,"01 20, 2002",2002,1443,"['Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'just', 'film', 'idea', 'thought', 'films', 'genre', 'have', 'ever', 'done', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'script', '8-year-old', 'could', 'follow', 'mediocre', 'acting.When', 'rented', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'had', 'mind', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'was', 'let', 'believe', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'terrifying', ""wasn't.The"", 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'gave', 'hope', 'Creep', 'like', 'call', 'monster', 'played', 'crazed', 'maniac', 'old', 'unexpectedly', 'powerful', 'vehicle', 'tries', 'run', 'main', 'characters', 'road', 'was', 'fresh', 'very', 'entertaining', 'was', 'done', 'Creep', 'made', 'first', 'appearance', 'costume', 'film', 'spiraled', 'down', 'hill.The', 'one', 'problem', 'have', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'days', 'are', 'overloaded', 'cliches', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'was', 'overloaded', 'were', 'typical', 'stupid', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'say', 'stupid', 'lines', 'Nobody', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'even', 'consider', 'doing', 'things', 'did.And', 'believability', 'parts', 'was', 'stretching', 'bit', 'Would', 'county', 'middle', 'where', 'have', 'police', 'force', 'size', 'Manhattan', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Things', 'just', 'really', 'took', 'toll', 'movie.Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'film', 'took', 'features', 'was', 'expected', 'horror', 'movie.', '[', ']', '3', 'Stars']",Jeepers Creepers
