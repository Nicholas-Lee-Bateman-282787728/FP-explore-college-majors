(as opposed to just cute)  But I did find it a bit flat visually.  It lacks the depth and richness of the original, the layering they did, literally, with several cells over-laying each other.  However, the rich colors make up for a lot.Really nothing from the book is here.  But then, Disney used very little from the book save names and a few characters.  As we know, Bambi's mother did not get killed in the book -- she did what does do, left her fawn longer and longer so he would get used to being by himself while she hangs out with the bucks during Rut.In fact, in the book, it is Bambi who gets shot.  He is only grazed but being hit with a thunderstick means death so he is positive he's dying until the Old Prince comes by and scolds him into getting up and moving into the woods to survive. Over time, without realizing it, Bambi replaces and becomes the Old Prince.  Simply by living.(Both of the Bambi books -- Bambi and Bambi's Children -- are not children's books. Man is referred to as HE and is given god qualities by the animals.  Very Nietzche.  In the second book we see event s/philosophy from the point of view of Bambi's daughter, who is a bit of a rebel. Now that's a book I'd like to see made into a movie.)Nothing in animation can match the original. The lush colors, the layering they did. Did I mention the incredible colors?Just a feast for the eye and a joy to the soul.Bambi II is delightful and I am glad I bought it.

938048,A3OCO2VYXPPJ9W,B000B8QG3G,"Any - Ren He ""Princess Kiara""","[0, 0]","I have been waiting for this movie expectantly for about 2 years and watched it several days ago. At first, I hoped that it could be as good as other Disney Video Premieres. But when I watched it, I found it was much better than my anticipation! I even thought it was the best Disney Video Premiere I have ever seen! It was even better than ""Lady and the Tramp-2: Scamp's Adventure""!Firstly, I think the story of ""Bambi-2"" was better than the original, because the classic in 1942 was too childish to me, and the stage lines of Bambi, which were the main character's, were only a little. I loved the plot that Thumper taught Bambi how to be brave, it always makes me laugh. And when I saw Bambi and the Great Prince, I felt warm inside, and I could feel the happiness and strong bond between father and son. At the end of the movie, I knew that Bambi and the Great Prince knew their importance to each other, and I felt happy and couldn't stop my tears because of excited.Secondly, the tableaus of this movie were beautiful and delicate. For example, Bambi saw his mother in his dream, Bambi's mother was surrounded by many butterflies and looked beautiful, as if there was a big bright halo behind her. Looked at Bambi's face, I could know how excited he was. And the tableaus of ""First Sign of Spring"" were so impressed. The faces of Bambi and the Great Prince , the running deer, the jumping grasshoppers and everything on the meadow, were so bright and delicate! In the night, the beautiful fireflies flew above Bambi's head and Great Prince looked at him, it was a gentle and fragrant tableau. At the end of the movie, Bambi, who had his little antlers, and his father looked above the forest where the butterflies flew, all the things made up an inspiring sight, and I was moved by it right away!Thirdly, I think the new songs were perfect. The lyric of ""There is Life"" was the best, we could find hope in this song's melody, and knew how lives cycle according to the lyric. ""The colder the winter, the warmer the spring. The deeper the sorrow, the more our hearts sing."" This was my favourite. ""First Sign of Spring"" ""Through Your Eyes"" and ""The Healing of the Heart"" were great songs too. In the soundtrack of this movie, includes 3 old songs from ""Bambi"", ""Love is a Song"" ""Little April Shower"" and ""Sing a Gay Little Spring Song"", they were 3 of my favourites. The scores of this movie were perfect, especially the scores in the plot Being Brave.Finally, the new character designing was very fantastic, especially Ronno. Actually, I think the young deer's face was lovely, and I loved his voice and little antlers, and his big grey-green eyes. But I think nobody likes his personality, he loved to sneer at others, he even was outrageous! However, he was a success of new character designing. The dub of all characters was great, especially Bambi's, the Great Prince's, Faline's Thumper's and Ronno's. Oh, yes, a new character, the Porcupine was very funny too, and a little crazy. And the original characters, Bambi, Thumper and Flower were cute just like before, or even cuter!So, I suggest that everyone go to see this movie, ""Bambi-2"".

938052,A3EW2L59UBHQSG,B000B8QG3G,Bruce Aguilar,"[7, 15]","By now we all expect Disney's direct to DVD sequels to be sub-par, but Bambi II surprises in it's beautiful art and animation.  I can honestly say that this is probably the best of these sequels so far.  That said, it still has some large flaws that will be hard for lovers of the original to overlook.Small children (7 and younger) will get the most out of this movie as they are it's target audience.  Adults will have to settle with appreciating the art and enjoying the fact that they can find nothing objectionalbe in the story.  That story takes place in the middle of the original Bambi and actually starts just seconds after Bambi's tragic loss in that film.  So it's really more accurate to call this movie a ""mid-quel"" than a sequel. This close a relationship between the two movies makes it nearly impossible not to compare them.Right off the bat, I noticed that characters personalities have been changed a bit for Bambi II.  Bambi is much more a rambunctious child than he used to be.  Flower seems to have lost intelligence and the background animals seem more sacchrine than ever, especially Thumpers sisters.  The reverence for nature so beautifully rendered in the original is an element that is basically done away with in this movie.  This feels more like an alternate universe of Bambi than a true contuniation of the originals story.  So as far as staying faithul, Bambi II fails.The story has a good message but doesn't tell it in a new or exciting way.  I'm giving the movie three stars becasue although I didn't enjoy it much and see myself watching it again, I'm sure small children will like it quite a bit.

The next time we meet him, he's a mature four-point buck ready to assume the role of an adult.  This direct-to-video release--which I thought superior to most examples of the kind I've watched heretofore--shows us what happened in between.  The Prince (excellently voiced by Patrick Stewart) at first finds fatherhood not only unfamiliar but somewhat beneath his dignity (""Princes look after the herd,"" he says-- ""does raise the young""), and certainly a lively, question-asking, yet still grieving young fawn (Alexander Gould) is an antler-full.  But Bambi too has adjustments to make as he tries to show his sire that he's worthy of the title of Prince.  He also meets old friends Faline (Andrea Bowen), Thumper (Brendon Baerq), and Flower the skunk (Nicky Jones), and runs afoul of a porcupine (Brian Pimental) and of young Ronno (Anthony Ghannam), the slightly older fawn he will one day battle for Faline's favors.  (Ronno is both a bully and a coward, as well as a boaster, and the fact that Bambi shows him up rather sharply no doubt contributes to the ferocity of their ultimate duel.)  Also back is Friend Owl (Keith Ferguson) and the lurking threat of Man with his dogs, guns, snares, and deer calls.  This movie might be especially meaningful to fathers and sons trying to adjust to custody or a mother's sudden death and to the necessity of learning to live with each other, but it's also thoroughly enjoyable on its own account.",4,Making adjustments,1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,1666,"['Following', 'offscreen', 'death', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'original', '1942', 'flickBambi', 'Two-Disc', 'Diamond', 'Edition', 'see', 'orphaned', 'fawn', 'found', 'woods', 'father', 'Great', 'Prince', 'Forest', 'taken', 'away', 'safety', 'next', 'time', 'meet', 'mature', 'four-point', 'buck', 'ready', 'assume', 'role', 'adult', 'direct-to-video', 'release', 'thought', 'superior', 'most', 'examples', 'kind', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'heretofore', 'happened', 'Prince', 'excellently', 'voiced', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'first', 'finds', 'fatherhood', 'not', 'only', 'unfamiliar', 'somewhat', 'beneath', 'dignity', 'Princes', 'look', 'herd', 'raise', 'young', 'certainly', 'lively', 'question-asking', 'yet', 'still', 'grieving', 'young', 'fawn', 'Alexander', 'Gould', 'antler-full', 'Bambi', 'too', 'adjustments', 'make', 'show', 'sire', 'worthy', 'title', 'Prince', 'also', 'old', 'friends', 'Faline', 'Andrea', 'Bowen', 'Thumper', 'Brendon', 'Baerq', 'Flower', 'skunk', 'Nicky', 'Jones', 'afoul', 'porcupine', 'Brian', 'Pimental', 'young', 'Ronno', 'Anthony', 'Ghannam', 'slightly', 'older', 'fawn', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'battle', 'Faline', 'favors', 'Ronno', 'bully', 'coward', 'as', 'well', 'boaster', 'fact', 'Bambi', 'up', 'rather', 'sharply', 'doubt', 'ferocity', 'ultimate', 'duel', 'Also', 'back', 'Friend', 'Owl', 'Keith', 'Ferguson', 'lurking', 'threat', 'Man', 'dogs', 'guns', 'snares', 'deer', 'calls', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'especially', 'meaningful', 'fathers', 'sons', 'trying', 'adjust', 'custody', 'mother', 'sudden', 'death', 'necessity', 'learning', 'live', 'other', 'also', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'account']",N/A

For whatever reason, I never saw Bambi as a child, and - now that I'm an adult - I've resisted watching it because I have heard how sad it is when Bambi's mother dies.  I can watch films with humans doing unspeakable things to one another and never bat an eye, but it just tears me up to see animals (whether real or cartoon) sad and hurting.  I can't get through Benji without sobbing, so I've just never felt up to the task of experiencing Bambi.  A grown man shouldn't admit this, but - just in case you're wondering - Bambi II did end up bringing a few tears to my eyes, as well.  That's okay, though.  Movies like this aren't just for children; in many ways, their message plays more powerfully to adult viewers, reminding us of the important things in life (especially in terms of the parent-child relationship).This isn't a sequel to Bambi, I should note, as the story actually fits in to the middle of the original film.  Bambi has just lost his mother, and now it is up to his father, the Great Prince, to take care of him.  The Great Prince does not take to parenting naturally or easily; he feels that a doe should raise the child, and he asks Friend Owl to help him find a new mother for Bambi once spring arrives.  Bambi desperately wants to please his father, but he is just too young to meet his father's high standards.  The Great Prince wants Bambi to behave as a prince, not as a young deer.  Fortunately, Bambi does have friends to play with, including Thumper and Flower.  Thumper even tries to teach him how to be brave.  All Bambi really wants, though, is for his father to be proud of him and to actually show him some affection.  Gradually, the Great Prince begins to come down off his pedestal to be an actual, caring father to the youngster.  The last half of the film is really more about the Great Prince than it is about Bambi, if you ask me; it's basically the story of a father's love.  The climactic scenes really work beautifully, taking you from tear-inducing sadness to exhilaration and suspense, eventually bringing every emotional aspect of the whole story to a deeply satisfying conclusion.The two young kids supplying the voices for Bambi and Thumper are really just superb, and Patrick Stewart brings incredible presence to the film as the voice of the Great Prince.  I also think the animation is wonderful.  The animation crew may have used some digital tools, but they clearly tried to follow in the footsteps of Bambi's illustrators in terms of their approach to the whole project, taking pains to remain faithful to the look and feel of the original.  Since I haven't seen the first Bambi, I can't compare the two films at all - but I do think the artwork of Bambi II really hits the mark.Along with the movie, you also get a good assortment of extra features on the DVD, including an interesting look at the making of Bambi II - this is where you really get a sense of the reverence Bambi II's makers have for the original film.  You also have the option of watching the movie with various Bambi trivia and fun facts popping up at relevant times.  A Disney animator shows budding young artists how to draw Thumper, and there's also a little ""find Thumper"" game for one or two players.  Naturally, you also get previews of some coming Disney attractions.All in all, Bambi II is an impressive package.  The film itself is what truly matters, of course, and I think it is really good.  Certainly, it's aimed at a young audience, but I can't agree with anyone saying there is nothing for adults in this film.  Bambi II's portrayal of the Great Prince's love for Bambi and his struggle to find the best way to raise the lad properly certainly touch upon issues that most parents will find close to their heart.  Bambi II certainly managed to touch my heart - and on more than one occasion.",5,An excellent film truly in the tradition of the original,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,4127,"['will', 'undoubtedly', 'find', 'hard', 'embrace', 'follow-up', 'Disney', '1942', 'classic', 'Bambi', 'found', 'Bambi', 'II', 'be', 'quite', 'enchanting', 'funny', 'very', 'touching', 'must', 'admit', 'bring', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'perspective', 'film', 'am', 'one', 'few', 'living', 'souls', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'reason', 'never', 'saw', 'Bambi', 'child', 'now', ""'m"", 'adult', ""'ve"", 'resisted', 'watching', 'have', 'heard', 'how', 'sad', 'when', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'can', 'watch', 'films', 'humans', 'doing', 'unspeakable', 'things', 'one', 'never', 'bat', 'eye', 'just', 'tears', 'see', 'animals', 'real', 'cartoon', 'sad', 'hurting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Benji', 'sobbing', ""'ve"", 'just', 'never', 'felt', 'up', 'task', 'experiencing', 'Bambi', 'grown', 'man', 'should', ""n't"", 'admit', 'just', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'Bambi', 'II', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'bringing', 'few', 'tears', 'eyes', 'as', 'well', 'okay', 'though', 'Movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'children', 'many', 'ways', 'message', 'more', 'powerfully', 'adult', 'viewers', 'reminding', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'especially', 'terms', 'parent-child', 'relationship', '.This', ""n't"", 'sequel', 'Bambi', 'should', 'note', 'story', 'actually', 'middle', 'original', 'film', 'Bambi', 'just', 'lost', 'mother', 'now', 'up', 'father', 'Great', 'Prince', 'take', 'care', 'Great', 'Prince', 'not', 'take', 'parenting', 'naturally', 'easily', 'doe', 'should', 'raise', 'child', 'Friend', 'Owl', 'help', 'find', 'new', 'mother', 'Bambi', 'once', 'spring', 'arrives', 'Bambi', 'desperately', 'please', 'father', 'just', 'too', 'young', 'meet', 'father', 'high', 'standards', 'Great', 'Prince', 'Bambi', 'behave', 'prince', 'not', 'young', 'deer', 'Fortunately', 'Bambi', 'have', 'friends', 'play', 'including', 'Thumper', 'Flower', 'Thumper', 'even', 'teach', 'how', 'be', 'brave', 'Bambi', 'really', 'though', 'father', 'be', 'proud', 'actually', 'show', 'affection', 'Gradually', 'Great', 'Prince', 'come', 'down', 'off', 'pedestal', 'be', 'actual', 'caring', 'father', 'youngster', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'really', 'more', 'Great', 'Prince', 'Bambi', 'ask', 'basically', 'story', 'father', 'love', 'climactic', 'scenes', 'really', 'work', 'beautifully', 'taking', 'tear-inducing', 'sadness', 'exhilaration', 'suspense', 'eventually', 'bringing', 'emotional', 'aspect', 'whole', 'story', 'deeply', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.The', 'two', 'young', 'kids', 'supplying', 'voices', 'Bambi', 'Thumper', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'superb', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'incredible', 'presence', 'film', 'voice', 'Great', 'Prince', 'also', 'think', 'animation', 'wonderful', 'animation', 'crew', 'may', 'have', 'used', 'digital', 'tools', 'clearly', 'tried', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'Bambi', 'illustrators', 'terms', 'approach', 'whole', 'project', 'taking', 'pains', 'remain', 'faithful', 'look', 'feel', 'original', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'Bambi', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'films', 'do', 'think', 'artwork', 'Bambi', 'II', 'really', 'mark.Along', 'movie', 'also', 'get', 'good', 'assortment', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'including', 'interesting', 'look', 'making', 'Bambi', 'II', 'where', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'reverence', 'Bambi', 'II', 'makers', 'have', 'original', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'option', 'watching', 'movie', 'various', 'Bambi', 'trivia', 'fun', 'facts', 'popping', 'up', 'relevant', 'times', 'Disney', 'animator', 'shows', 'budding', 'young', 'artists', 'how', 'draw', 'Thumper', 'also', 'little', 'find', 'Thumper', 'game', 'one', 'two', 'players', 'Naturally', 'also', 'get', 'previews', 'coming', 'Disney', 'attractions.All', 'Bambi', 'II', 'impressive', 'package', 'film', 'what', 'truly', 'matters', 'course', 'think', 'really', 'good', 'Certainly', 'aimed', 'young', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'anyone', 'saying', 'nothing', 'adults', 'film', 'Bambi', 'II', 'portrayal', 'Great', 'Prince', 'love', 'Bambi', 'struggle', 'find', 'best', 'way', 'raise', 'lad', 'properly', 'certainly', 'touch', 'issues', 'most', 'parents', 'will', 'find', 'close', 'heart', 'Bambi', 'II', 'certainly', 'managed', 'touch', 'heart', 'more', 'one', 'occasion']",N/A

Second, the few songs peppered throughout were neither enchanting nor memorable (I forgot them as they were being sung).  Thirdly, the sensibilities over utilized throughout this new story are streamlined to fit today's humor and have little to no bearing on the first film (making it jarring to watch these films back to back).  The attempts to jazz up the storyline are painfully ridiculous.  Adding a bully (Ronno), a persnickety porcupine, and a daffy groundhog didn't help matters.

A lot of them turn out to be disappointments, mediocre at best. When I first heard that there was going to be ""Bambi II"" late last year, I was a bit wary of the sequel. I recently had the opportunity to view the sequel. Much to my surprise, ""Bambi II"" turned out to be a surprise delight.The story picks up when Bambi (Alex Gould) loses his mother and his father The Great Prince (voiced by the wonderful Patrick Stewart with his rich baritone voice), the head buck of the herd is unexpectedly put in the position of raising his young son. Both father and son slowly learn about each other and themselves as they live together. Flower, Thumper, Owl, and Feline are all in this film. A new character is introduced, a young buck named Ronno who torments Bambi every second he gets.The animation may not be as great as the original Bambi was and still is but the storyline and the music makes up for the animation. The voice overs were terrific. Patrick Stewart was perfect as the majestic and regal The Great Prince. Alexander Gould fit the role of Bambi right to the tee. I liked the fact that the film did more than just show Bambi growing up but allowed his character and the other characters in the film to develop. The music by Alison Krauss, Martina McBride, and Michelle Lewis was excellent, almost moved me to tears especially ""There is Life"" by Alison Krauss.

938071,AA266SRDPZCNH,B000B8QG3G,Fred,"[2, 6]","As others have said, Bambi II was pretty good.  Considering its budget, it matched the look of the original fairly well, and the voices were pretty good too.  A couple of scenes had some dialog that was much too modern though and was a jarring contrast to the rest of the film (for example, one scene where Thumper taunts Bambi to be more brave).But the worst thing about the film, and it was bad enough to practically ruin everything that they got right, was the songs.  The background score was quite good, but the songs were just awful.  They didn't fit with the original AT ALL, and there's no reason they couldn't have.  Since this movie takes place in the middle of the original, it was, to me, stupid to have such a drastic change in the type of songs.  Even when taken on their own merit the new songs weren't very good.  They were way too obvious and on-the-nose; no subtlety, no cleverness, no class.And the shame is that its target audience (kids) would be fine with the style of songs in the original-- they're not about to turn off the TV if a song isn't a drippy, syrupy pop song like the newer Disney films are so full of.  If that were the case they wouldn't watch the original Bambi, would they?And I do wish they kept the original title, ""Bambi & The Great Prince of the Forest"" instead of ""Bambi II"".  Yes, I know the original title was longer, but it was more interesting than ""Bambi II"" (it could have been shortened to ""Bambi & The Great Prince"").  Plus, this isn't really a sequel, so the ""II"" isn't really correct.  A minor quibble, I know.SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD...Lastly, I thought it ended abruptly.  Yes, I know it had to lead into the original, but what they had didn't feel (to me) like an an adequate resolution for all of the characters.  For example, there was no resolution to the sub-plot with Ronno, Bambi's rival, and no real resolution to the relationship between Bambi and his father.  (It would have been nice, since the film's main audience will be young children, to see either some negative consequences for Ronno, or have him see the error of his ways and even apologize.)",3,"Not bad, but the songs were awful",1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,2113,"['others', 'have', 'said', 'Bambi', 'II', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Considering', 'budget', 'matched', 'look', 'original', 'fairly', 'well', 'voices', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'couple', 'scenes', 'had', 'dialog', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'modern', 'was', 'jarring', 'contrast', 'rest', 'film', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Thumper', 'Bambi', 'be', 'more', 'brave', 'worst', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'practically', 'ruin', 'everything', 'got', 'right', 'was', 'songs', 'background', 'score', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'songs', 'were', 'just', 'awful', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'original', 'AT', 'ALL', 'reason', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'place', 'middle', 'original', 'was', 'stupid', 'have', 'drastic', 'change', 'type', 'songs', 'Even', 'when', 'taken', 'own', 'merit', 'new', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'obvious', 'on-the-nose', 'subtlety', 'cleverness', 'class.And', 'shame', 'target', 'audience', 'kids', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'style', 'songs', 'original', ""'re"", 'not', 'turn', 'off', 'TV', 'song', ""n't"", 'drippy', 'syrupy', 'pop', 'song', 'newer', 'Disney', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'full', 'were', 'case', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'original', 'Bambi', 'would', 'do', 'wish', 'kept', 'original', 'title', 'Bambi', 'Great', 'Prince', 'Forest', 'instead', 'Bambi', 'II', 'Yes', 'know', 'original', 'title', 'was', 'longer', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'Bambi', 'II', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shortened', 'Bambi', 'Great', 'Prince', ""n't"", 'really', 'sequel', 'II', ""n't"", 'really', 'correct', 'minor', 'quibble', 'know.SLIGHT', 'SPOILER', 'AHEAD', 'Lastly', 'thought', 'ended', 'abruptly', 'Yes', 'know', 'had', 'lead', 'original', 'what', 'had', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'adequate', 'resolution', 'characters', 'example', 'was', 'resolution', 'sub-plot', 'Ronno', 'Bambi', 'rival', 'real', 'resolution', 'relationship', 'Bambi', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'film', 'main', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'young', 'children', 'see', 'either', 'negative', 'consequences', 'Ronno', 'have', 'see', 'error', 'ways', 'even', 'apologize']",N/A

938073,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B000B8QG3G,General Breadbasket,"[0, 2]","""Bambi II"" is a fine tribute to the original Disney film, and it's a decent sequel as well.It's set between the winter and the spring, just after Bambi's mother had died just up to Bambi getting his antlers. The Prince of the Forest, Bambi's father (Patrick Stewart) is looking after him, though he's not really sure how. Bambi's not too sure how to be a good son to such a mighty leader, either, and tries to impress his Dad whenever he can. Thumper the bunny has to look after his sisters, but often plays hide and seek instead, while Flower manages to get up early from hibernation. Will Bambi impress his Dad? Will the Great Prince warm to his son in the midst of winter?A lot of care has gone into the making of this film, I think, into the movement of each character, the scenery, voices and such. There's a couple of facial expressions that I thought were a bit too ""modern Disney"" for Bambi and his friends to make, but anyway. The score is close to the original too. That's not to say it's an exact copy. There's a few modern shots which the animators couldn't have done back in the 1940s, and they're pretty interesting.Special features include a making of documentary, a ""how to draw Thumper"" featurette, a ""Find Thumper"" DVD remote game and a ""trivia track"" option for the film.Worth a look for Disney fans.

938074,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B000B8QG3G,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[1, 1]","It seems that no one who embarked on creating a sequel to one of Walt Disney's most celebrated animated classics went forward with a foolish sense of bravado -- as if it were possible to recapture the circumstances that combined Walt himself with a ""perfect storm"" of artistic talents to bring the 1942 Bambi to the big screen. Add to that, a direct-to-DVD budget that would never match modern-day dollars it would have taken to reach the level of the original. Fortunately, the sequel's creative team were not that foolhardy and instead approached the project with respect, affection and reverence.What the makers of Bambi 2 did have, however, was digital technology allowing them to fashion vivid settings very much in the painterly style of the first film; some very elaborate animation (particularly for a direct-to-DVD release) and most of all, the supervision of master animator Andreas Deja to keep the standards as high as possible.The results are remarkably effective. It cannot summon the power and majesty of the original (and it would be outrageous to expect that in any case), but Bambi 2 is one of the most solid and satisfying of the much-maligned Disney video sequels.In addition to the very sincere adherence to the visual style, it is the sound track that impresses, with the great Patrick Stewart voicing the Great Prince and a spot-on voice cast clearly chosen for their accuracy in reproducing the original cast instead of relying on a lot of celebrity names. The young boy voicing Thumper is especially amazing. It is a triumph of smart voice casting over marketing demands.Also notable is Joel McNeely's score, which interpolates themes from the landmark music by Edward Plumb and the melody of the Oscar-nominated ""Love is a Song."" New songs, particularly ""There is Life"" sung by Alison Krauss, are fine complements to the new story, as were the songs in the original. One might object to the easy-listening contemporary style of these songs, but the 1942 songs were performed very much in the style of their time, as well.On Blu-ray it all looks even better. But you'll definitely want to pair this with the Walt Disney classic and not worry too much about making comparisons. Just revel in their respective merits.My only real issue is with the title. ""Bambi 2"" simply invites comparison and suggest the inherent misgivings of a sequel. I'm sure there was much discussion before the title was selected, but I would have preferred the alternate, Bambi and the Great Prince. Maybe there was a concern that this title might have made some expect that Bambi was going to encounter a rock star or a box of elbow macaroni.",5,"Reverent, affectionate complement to the original Disney classic",1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,2642,"['one', 'who', 'embarked', 'creating', 'sequel', 'one', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'most', 'celebrated', 'animated', 'classics', 'went', 'forward', 'foolish', 'sense', 'bravado', 'were', 'possible', 'recapture', 'circumstances', 'combined', 'Walt', 'perfect', 'storm', 'artistic', 'talents', 'bring', '1942', 'Bambi', 'big', 'screen', 'Add', 'direct-to-DVD', 'budget', 'would', 'never', 'match', 'modern-day', 'dollars', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'reach', 'level', 'original', 'Fortunately', 'sequel', 'creative', 'team', 'were', 'not', 'foolhardy', 'instead', 'approached', 'project', 'respect', 'affection', 'reverence.What', 'makers', 'Bambi', '2', 'did', 'have', 'however', 'was', 'digital', 'technology', 'allowing', 'fashion', 'vivid', 'settings', 'very', 'much', 'painterly', 'style', 'first', 'film', 'very', 'elaborate', 'animation', 'particularly', 'direct-to-DVD', 'release', 'most', 'supervision', 'master', 'animator', 'Andreas', 'Deja', 'keep', 'standards', 'as', 'high', 'possible.The', 'results', 'are', 'remarkably', 'effective', 'can', 'not', 'summon', 'power', 'majesty', 'original', 'would', 'be', 'outrageous', 'expect', 'case', 'Bambi', '2', 'one', 'most', 'solid', 'satisfying', 'much-maligned', 'Disney', 'video', 'sequels.In', 'addition', 'very', 'sincere', 'adherence', 'visual', 'style', 'sound', 'track', 'great', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'voicing', 'Great', 'Prince', 'spot-on', 'voice', 'cast', 'clearly', 'chosen', 'accuracy', 'reproducing', 'original', 'cast', 'instead', 'relying', 'lot', 'celebrity', 'names', 'young', 'boy', 'voicing', 'Thumper', 'especially', 'amazing', 'triumph', 'smart', 'voice', 'casting', 'marketing', 'demands.Also', 'notable', 'Joel', 'McNeely', 'score', 'themes', 'landmark', 'music', 'Edward', 'Plumb', 'melody', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Love', 'Song', 'New', 'songs', 'particularly', 'Life', 'sung', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'are', 'fine', 'complements', 'new', 'story', 'were', 'songs', 'original', 'One', 'might', 'object', 'easy-listening', 'contemporary', 'style', 'songs', '1942', 'songs', 'were', 'performed', 'very', 'much', 'style', 'time', 'well.On', 'Blu-ray', 'even', 'better', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'pair', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'classic', 'not', 'worry', 'too', 'much', 'making', 'comparisons', 'Just', 'revel', 'respective', 'merits.My', 'only', 'real', 'issue', 'title', 'Bambi', '2', 'simply', 'comparison', 'suggest', 'inherent', 'misgivings', 'sequel', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'much', 'discussion', 'title', 'was', 'selected', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'alternate', 'Bambi', 'Great', 'Prince', 'Maybe', 'was', 'concern', 'title', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'expect', 'Bambi', 'was', 'going', 'encounter', 'rock', 'star', 'box', 'elbow', 'macaroni']",N/A

938083,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B000B8QG3G,Joe Sherry,"[5, 5]","What story is there left to tell exactly?  Why does the 1942 Disney classic ""Bambi"" need a sequel?  Truly, no sequel is needed since ""Bambi"" is a true classic and is one of the great animated movies in film history.  At the end of ""Bambi"" Bambi himself was grown and found a mate and was to raise his own family.  The same for Flower and Thumper.  When I first heard of ""Bambi II"" I assumed that somehow this would be the same exact story that we had in the first movie, except that it would be about Bambi raising his son and the new fawn would go on adventures.  What else would the sequel be about?Quite a bit, apparently.  ""Bambi II"" is not quite a sequel as it is ""Bambi 1.5"".  In between Bambi (Alex Gould) being a young fawn after his mother's death and him growing up at the end of the first movie there is all sorts of adventure and growing up and finding a mate that really wasn't  covered in ""Bambi"".  That's what ""Bambi II"" is: a sequel to the first part of ""Bambi"" and a prequel to the ending.Here Bambi is raised by his father, The Great Prince (voice of Patrick Stewart).  Bambi misses his mother very much and his father only knows how to be the solitary ruler of the forest.  The Great Prince is disappointed in Bambi and Bambi wants desperately to earn his approval.  But the first part of the movie is very lighthearted all the same and features some romping and adventure with Bambi, Thumper, and Flower.  Bambi has a rival fawn, a slightly older deer who has started to grow antlers and is named Ronald.The animation here is very reminiscent of the original film and stands up quite well in comparison.  ""Bambi II"" seems to be drawn in a more classical style compared to much of the CG animation being done these days.I suppose ""Bambi II"" is very much your typical coming of age movie with struggles for acceptance, and the eventual growth (we know just where the story has to go because it ties into the end of ""Bambi""), but it is surprisingly good.  I expected a junky direct to video sequel with no amount of fun or interest involved (for an example, see ""Kronk's New Groove""...or better yet: don't), but I was wrong.  This is a cute, fun family movie.  Clocking it at only 73 minutes, this is a movie that is better than it has a right to be and one that does not ruin memories of the original.  The original may not have needed a sequel, but the sequel measures up as well as it possibly could be.The DVD is a little bit light on special features, but this should not be too surprising on a straight to video release.  There are two games ""Thumper's Hurry and Scurry"" and ""Disney's Sketch Pad""  Thumper's game has you navigate through the forest to find Thumper.  This game could get frustrating for the littlest ones.  ""Disney's Sketch Pad"" has one of the Disney animators giving a lesson on how to draw Thumper and advice to young artists who might want to get into animation.

Custom-made intermissions for a 2 hour and 15 minutes or so viewing experience.  The original Bambi is just about perfect, but in fact the bursting through of spring and Bambi cleaning his first antlers has always seemed a little abrupt after the powerful scene that proceeds it.  Original Bambi as a character was always a bit bland when compared to Thumper, too--this movie adds layers and texture to Bambi himself and makes it truly his story.  The makers of Bambi II have blended in plenty of the original's background music, and that helps set the tone and make the two blend together.  This movie looks well enough--Bambi matches fairly well, though Thumper is a bit flat--but it would be asking too much for any computer artist to match the oil paintings and hand-drawn animation of the orginal.  Don't get me wrong--this looks great, and the animation is top notch, but having the original first and last with this in the middle lets the beauty of the original be the last image in your mind, while the strength of this new story lends depth and richness to the tale.

938088,A3SGBLYWBCXJRW,B000B8QG3G,Keith A. Mather,"[8, 9]","I love Bambi. I wasn't too crazy about the movie when I was very little (I thought it was too cheerful and too musical), but now that I'm older and I've had a chance to see it again and really take a good look at it, it's become one of my all-time favorite movies. The song ""Love is a Song"" and the scene where Bambi's mother dies both make me tingle almost every time.And Bambi 2 is a wonderful sequel to such a wonderful movie. It takes place shortly after Bambi's mother is killed by the hunters. (Those darn hunters!) Don't worry, you don't actually relive the death scene in this movie.Bambi is running around in the woods, calling his mother's name, just like in the first movie, and is receiving no response. Then he runs smack into his father, the Great Prince of the Forest, or the Great Prince, for short. The Great Prince informs Bambi that his mother can't be with him anymore, and then he leads him to his own den, which is located in another part of the forest. Bambi, as you can well imagine, is devastated by the loss of his mother. The Great Prince then speaks to Friend Owl (who somehow knows of Bambi's mother's death and is feeling very sorry for the little fawn), asking him to help find a suitable doe to raise Bambi, as Bambi is still quite young and isn't ready to manage on his own yet.Due to harsh conditions (such as the shortage of food and the intense wintry weather), Bambi is temporarily placed in the care of the Great Prince himself. The Great Prince is very reluctant at first (in his opinion, a prince's sole responsibility is to look after the herd; does care for the young), but he agrees. So Bambi spends the rest of the winter with his father.Eventually spring arrives, and Bambi meets up with his old pals, Thumper the rabbit and Flower the skunk. He even meets up with Faline, his crush, and Ronno, the big brute that he battles with in the first movie.Ronno is sort of the antagonist of this movie, but the real antagonist is man. I won't give away any details, but there is one scene in the movie where a pack of vicious dogs attack Bambi. Luckily the Great Prince arrives just in time and fights the dogs off. Then he and Bambi race into the trees together just as man is firing at them with a gun.Bambi feels like he's a big disappointment to his father. He makes it his goal to prove that he can be every bit as brave and stalwart as the Great Prince. Thumper gives Bambi a hand (er, I mean, a paw) and Flower sort of helps out as well.Eventually the time comes when Bambi's courage--and the Great Prince's love for his son--is put to the ultimate test. The same pack of dogs that attacked Bambi earlier in the movie start to advance on a helpless doe, and Bambi is torn between running far away and saving the doe's life. Finally he makes up his mind that the doe will not die in the same way his mother did, and he bravely lures the dogs away from her.The Great Prince goes after his son, and soon Bambi is able to thwart every last one of the dogs. But just when it seems like everything's going to be okay, Bambi takes an unexpected fall from the edge of a cliff. When the Great Prince finds him, it looks as if Bambi has died. The Great Prince, who has all but ignored Bambi for nearly half the movie, is heartbroken. He actually gets down on the ground beside Bambi and nuzzles him gently as a single tear rolls down his cheek. (This is by far the most touching and poignant scene in the entire film. Anyone who is not affected by this scene would have to have a heart of stone.) Fortunately, Bambi comes to his senses and opens his eyes, and the Great Prince is greatly relieved. They spend the next few minutes or so rubbing their faces together, and their relationship with one another improves greatly after that.This movie is every bit as magical as the original. The animation is just as rich, and the music is just as inspiring. And the morals this film teaches are priceless. It's not as long as the first Bambi, but it's a real keeper.If you haven't seen this movie yet, then I strongly recommend that you do so.

938093,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000B8QG3G,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[87, 93]","Like many people who were weaned on the classic animated films made by Walt Disney, I have been less than thrilled by the onslaught of direct-to-video sequels the company has been producing the last dozen years.  Starting with ""The Return of Jafar"" in 1994, we have not only seen sequels to many recent animated films, such as ""Beauty and the Beast: Enchanted Christmas"" and ""Lion King II: Simba's Pride,"" but direct-to-video follow ups to some of those classic Disney films, as is the case with ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" and ""Cinderella II: Dreams Come True.""  Consequently, when I sat down to watch ""Bambi II"" I was fully expecting to be bitterly disappointed.  Instead I was pleasantly surprised (actually, I was floored).""Bambi II"" begins with the well-remembered moment from the original when Bambi (voiced by Alexander Gould) is looking for his mother and The Great Prince of the Forest (Patrick Stewart) informs his son that she will not be coming back, and ends with Bambi still a fawn.  The beloved characters Thumper (Brendon Baerg) and Flower (Nicky Jones) return, as does Feline (Andrea Bowen), but having more of an impact is a character who only appears briefly in the original, Ronno (Anthony Ghannam), another fawn whose antlers have already come in.  Ronno not only keeps calling Bambi a baby and a coward, but is also making moves on Feline.  Meanwhile, The Great Prince is having trouble with his new responsibility for raising his young son and teaching him the ways of the forest, and Bambi is trying to impress his father.  Neither one of them is succeeding all that well.Directed by Brian Pimental (who also voices both the Groundhog and the Porcupine), this 2006 direct-to-video release has several things going for it, starting with having Patrick Stewart voice Bambi's father.  But the greatest strength is thestory by Pimental and Jeanne Rosenberg with a screenplay by Alicia Kirk inspired by the original story of ""Bambi"" by Felix Salten.  Bambi is trying to learn how to confront his fear and stand up to Ronno and other dangers in the forest.  The film never uses the phrase ""deer caught in a headlight,"" but that is what Bambi looks like at times and it is something he needs to overcome.  What I liked the best is that there are several moments when father and son start to connect, but it does not quite work out, so that there is actually some character development and not just a sudden happy ending.  Overall, there is actually more of a plot here than simply Bambi growing up.The animation is done in the same style of the original classic, and if it is not as rich in detail the differences are far less than you would expect from a direct-to-video feature.  I have always considered ""Bambi"" to have the most beautiful artwork of any of the Disney films, and this one does not suffer that much in comparison (the animators do seem to like bright yellows more this time around).  There is one cutesy animal sung song, ""Let's Sing a Gay Little Spring Song,"" based on Frank Churchill's score for the original film, but most of the songs serve as backdrops for various sequences and are done by some familiar country singers:  Alison Krauss' ""There is Life,"" Michelle Lewis' ""First Sign of Spring,"" and Martina McBride's ""Through Your Eyes.""  Anthony Callea performs ""The Healing of a Heart"" during the closing credits.The film is shown in ""Family-Friendly Widescreen"" (1.78:1), which is enhanced for 16 x 9 televisions, and also has a French language track.  The bonus features on this DVD consist of a Making-Of featurette, ""The Legacy Continues,"" and a ""Bambi's Trivia Track"" that can provide a constant stream of pop ups with fun facts as you watch the film.  Kids will enjoy ""Thumper's Hurry & Scurry Game"" and there is also a ""Disney Sketch Pad"" piece in which Disney animator Andreas Deja teaches us how to draw Thumper.The end result is a half-step down in quality from the original classic, which is amazing enough to justify rounding up on this one.  Granted, no animated film will ever take the place that ""Bambi"" has in the collective psyche of the millions of youngsters who were devastated when Bambi's mother was killed.  Still, ""Bambi II"" sets the bar pretty high for a sequel (it is certainly good enough that they could have released this to theaters) and we can only hope future direct-to-video offerings will follow suit.",5,"Believe it or not, an excellent direct-to-video sequel of the classic Disney film",1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,4392,"['many', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'weaned', 'classic', 'animated', 'films', 'made', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'thrilled', 'onslaught', 'direct-to-video', 'sequels', 'company', 'been', 'producing', 'last', 'dozen', 'years', 'Starting', 'Return', 'Jafar', '1994', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'seen', 'sequels', 'many', 'recent', 'animated', 'films', 'such', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Enchanted', 'Christmas', 'Lion', 'King', 'II', 'Simba', 'Pride', 'direct-to-video', 'follow', 'ups', 'classic', 'Disney', 'films', 'case', 'Lady', 'Tramp', 'II', 'Scamp', 'Adventure', 'Cinderella', 'II', 'Dreams', 'Come', 'True', 'Consequently', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Bambi', 'II', 'was', 'fully', 'expecting', 'be', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', 'Instead', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'actually', 'was', 'floored', 'Bambi', 'II', 'well-remembered', 'moment', 'original', 'when', 'Bambi', 'voiced', 'Alexander', 'Gould', 'looking', 'mother', 'Great', 'Prince', 'Forest', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'son', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'Bambi', 'still', 'fawn', 'beloved', 'characters', 'Thumper', 'Brendon', 'Baerg', 'Flower', 'Nicky', 'Jones', 'return', 'Feline', 'Andrea', 'Bowen', 'having', 'more', 'impact', 'character', 'who', 'only', 'briefly', 'original', 'Ronno', 'Anthony', 'Ghannam', 'fawn', 'antlers', 'have', 'already', 'come', 'Ronno', 'not', 'only', 'calling', 'Bambi', 'baby', 'coward', 'also', 'making', 'moves', 'Feline', 'Meanwhile', 'Great', 'Prince', 'having', 'trouble', 'new', 'responsibility', 'raising', 'young', 'son', 'teaching', 'ways', 'forest', 'Bambi', 'trying', 'impress', 'father', 'one', 'succeeding', 'well.Directed', 'Brian', 'Pimental', 'who', 'also', 'Groundhog', 'Porcupine', '2006', 'direct-to-video', 'release', 'several', 'things', 'going', 'starting', 'having', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'voice', 'Bambi', 'father', 'greatest', 'strength', 'thestory', 'Pimental', 'Jeanne', 'Rosenberg', 'screenplay', 'Alicia', 'Kirk', 'inspired', 'original', 'story', 'Bambi', 'Felix', 'Salten', 'Bambi', 'trying', 'learn', 'how', 'confront', 'fear', 'stand', 'up', 'Ronno', 'other', 'dangers', 'forest', 'film', 'never', 'phrase', 'deer', 'caught', 'headlight', 'what', 'Bambi', 'times', 'something', 'overcome', 'What', 'liked', 'best', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'when', 'father', 'son', 'start', 'connect', 'not', 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'so', 'actually', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'just', 'sudden', 'happy', 'ending', 'Overall', 'actually', 'more', 'plot', 'here', 'simply', 'Bambi', 'growing', 'up.The', 'animation', 'done', 'same', 'style', 'original', 'classic', 'not', 'rich', 'detail', 'differences', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'would', 'expect', 'direct-to-video', 'feature', 'have', 'always', 'considered', 'Bambi', 'have', 'most', 'beautiful', 'artwork', 'Disney', 'films', 'one', 'not', 'suffer', 'much', 'comparison', 'animators', 'do', 'seem', 'like', 'bright', 'yellows', 'more', 'time', 'around', 'one', 'cutesy', 'animal', 'sung', 'song', 'Let', 'Sing', 'Gay', 'Little', 'Spring', 'Song', 'based', 'Frank', 'Churchill', 'score', 'original', 'film', 'most', 'songs', 'serve', 'backdrops', 'various', 'sequences', 'are', 'done', 'familiar', 'country', 'singers', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'Life', 'Michelle', 'Lewis', 'First', 'Sign', 'Spring', 'Martina', 'McBride', 'Eyes', 'Anthony', 'Callea', 'Healing', 'Heart', 'closing', 'credits.The', 'film', 'shown', 'Family-Friendly', 'Widescreen', '1.78:1', 'enhanced', '16', 'x', '9', 'televisions', 'also', 'French', 'language', 'track', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'consist', 'Making-Of', 'featurette', 'Legacy', 'Continues', 'Bambi', 'Trivia', 'Track', 'can', 'provide', 'constant', 'stream', 'pop', 'ups', 'fun', 'facts', 'watch', 'film', 'Kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Thumper', 'Hurry', 'Scurry', 'Game', 'also', 'Disney', 'Sketch', 'Pad', 'piece', 'Disney', 'animator', 'Andreas', 'Deja', 'how', 'draw', 'Thumper.The', 'end', 'result', 'half-step', 'down', 'quality', 'original', 'classic', 'amazing', 'enough', 'justify', 'rounding', 'up', 'one', 'Granted', 'animated', 'film', 'will', 'ever', 'take', 'place', 'Bambi', 'collective', 'psyche', 'millions', 'youngsters', 'who', 'were', 'devastated', 'when', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'was', 'killed', 'Still', 'Bambi', 'II', 'bar', 'pretty', 'high', 'sequel', 'certainly', 'good', 'enough', 'could', 'have', 'released', 'theaters', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'future', 'direct-to-video', 'offerings', 'will', 'follow', 'suit']",N/A

The Great Prince's growing affection for his son is very well done and there are some exciting sequences. And thankfully Thumper's pesty little sisters were just that, and not brainless goons like they made Scamp's sisters. I also applaud the scriptwriters who actually seem to have READ THE BOOK and, while still having too many cute Thumper and Flower sequences, did incorporate some parts into the movie: Ronno, the deer call (although in the book it was ""Faline"" calling Bambi when he was older, not his ""Mother""), and the young doe, who I believe in the book actually is caught by the dogs.

Indeed Disney did a great job with the follow-up story, succeeding at maintaining the spirit of the original story alive and pushing it into the next stage of the life of the deer we learned to love in our childhood.In ""Bambi II"", after the death of his mother, Bambi lives with his father (The Great Prince) whom at first is blind to the needs of his youngster and obsessed with making sure he turns out to be a good prince. Their relationship evolves and the story delivers a healthy balance of adventure, joy and thrills all the way to the end. The result is a healthy bond that forms between the two, which lies at the heart of the lesson one can learn from the movie.The music doesn't overwhelm the animated performances (the way other follow-up Disney movies have done) and the dialog keeps you engaged and interested all through the movie.

938100,A3MVMPFBN1RFFV,B000B8QG3G,M. H Shamp,"[1, 3]","When I first heard the Bambi II commercial on TV I thought to myself, ""Yeah whatever."" The original Bambi was the best cartoon I'd ever watched in my life, and I have never forgotten how transfixed I was. I thought the new one is just trying to take off from the old one, but I got it for my son because I figured it is good enough to watch. Not all cartoons can aspire to the great Bambi.I am happy to report that although this Bambi II cannot be called as good, it is quite close. The animation is detailed. In particular, Thumper's voice and tone sounds EXACTLY like the original - wow! The forest and meadow scenery is all good, and everything is done with an obvious effort to emulate the original. It is a worthy movie for both adults and kids.There is just one problem I encountered with this movie. While watching Bambi's Dad come to his aid after his mother died, my seven-year-old asked,""Why wasn't Bambi's dad around when his mother was alive, Mama?""Not knowing what to say, I said, ""Because he is just a dumb deer!""The truth is, of course, that Bambi's dad probably has a harem of a couple of hundred does and therefore can't possibly spend much time with each fawn. But how am I supposed to explain that? You might want to think of a better answer than mine, though, because I ran into trouble the next day when I watched it again with my son:Me: See, Bambi's dad can fight off the hunting dogs because he is a smart old deer.Son: I thought you said he's just a dumb deer!Me: Well, yeah. But an old deer like Bambi's dad is always very smart. They know how to stay away from hunters, too.Son: But you said he's just a dumb deer!Me: (discreetly silent to let the subject pass.)The extras on the DVD teach how to draw Thumper and interview the chief animator and the two main voices - Thumper and Bambi. They claim to have conducted countless auditions for Thumper, and I can tell. That kid's voice sounds so much like the original Thumper that it is almost uncanny. What really shocked me was the voice of Bambi's dad. It was none other than Captain Picard of the Enterprise! I am a huge Star Trek TNG fan, and I watch the reruns all the time. Yet, I never recognized Patrick Stewart's voice. In this cartoon, he sounds like a deer!On one of the subtitle choices, the movie flashes information such as ""skunks are gentle animals"" or ""flying squirrels don't fly, they glide"" which my son likes and makes the movie deserve several viewing.The DVD also comes with a simple hide-and-seek 3D computer game for little kids. My son enjoyed it for a while.I recommend this movie.P.S.I had problems starting this DVD in my brand-new player. It would start just fine with the Disney Logo, then it will die into blackness. I didn't even get to see the FBI warning.  No button such as ""fast forward"" or ""menu"" works. I would stop it and start again, and it may make it past the first blackness, the previews will kick on for about 10 minutes, then it dies into blackness again. This time, even the stop button doesn't work. (My player shows a little palm to mean the button I pushed is disabled by the DVD. But why?) I then push the open/close button to open and close it, push play again, and it starts immediately at the beginning of the movie! Never did get to see the FBI warning, but it's there; I saw it later when I watched the DVD on my computer.)There might be something wrong with my player, but I suspect the fault has more to do with Disney's anti-piracy plans and my player's being plugged into a VHS recorder. Disney movies are heavily copy-protected. You can only record such a DVD movie if you have a Digital Video Stabilizer which costs around $30. (It IS legal to make backup copies of movies you own for your own protection - protection against your four-year-old's sticky, omnipresent fingers, for example.) I don't own a stabilizer because I am too lazy to record stuff, but I know that if I ever want to, Disney can't stop me.",5,Almost as good as the first one,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,3948,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Bambi', 'II', 'commercial', 'TV', 'thought', 'myself', 'Yeah', 'original', 'Bambi', 'was', 'best', 'cartoon', ""'d"", 'ever', 'watched', 'life', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'how', 'transfixed', 'was', 'thought', 'new', 'one', 'just', 'trying', 'take', 'off', 'old', 'one', 'got', 'son', 'figured', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'Not', 'cartoons', 'can', 'aspire', 'great', 'Bambi.I', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'Bambi', 'II', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'as', 'good', 'quite', 'close', 'animation', 'detailed', 'particular', 'Thumper', 'voice', 'tone', 'EXACTLY', 'original', 'wow', 'forest', 'meadow', 'scenery', 'good', 'everything', 'done', 'obvious', 'effort', 'emulate', 'original', 'worthy', 'movie', 'adults', 'kids.There', 'just', 'one', 'problem', 'encountered', 'movie', 'watching', 'Bambi', 'Dad', 'come', 'aid', 'mother', 'died', 'seven-year-old', 'asked', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'Bambi', 'dad', 'when', 'mother', 'was', 'alive', 'Mama', 'Not', 'knowing', 'what', 'say', 'said', 'just', 'dumb', 'deer', 'truth', 'course', 'Bambi', 'dad', 'probably', 'harem', 'couple', 'hundred', 'therefore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'fawn', 'how', 'am', 'supposed', 'explain', 'might', 'want', 'think', 'better', 'answer', 'mine', 'though', 'ran', 'trouble', 'next', 'day', 'when', 'watched', 'again', 'son', 'Me', 'See', 'Bambi', 'dad', 'can', 'fight', 'off', 'hunting', 'dogs', 'smart', 'old', 'deer.Son', 'thought', 'said', 'just', 'dumb', 'deer', 'Me', 'Well', 'yeah', 'old', 'deer', 'Bambi', 'dad', 'always', 'very', 'smart', 'know', 'how', 'stay', 'away', 'hunters', 'too.Son', 'said', 'just', 'dumb', 'deer', 'Me', 'discreetly', 'silent', 'let', 'subject', 'pass', 'extras', 'DVD', 'teach', 'how', 'draw', 'Thumper', 'interview', 'chief', 'animator', 'two', 'main', 'voices', 'Thumper', 'Bambi', 'claim', 'have', 'conducted', 'countless', 'auditions', 'Thumper', 'can', 'tell', 'kid', 'voice', 'so', 'much', 'original', 'Thumper', 'almost', 'uncanny', 'What', 'really', 'shocked', 'was', 'voice', 'Bambi', 'dad', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'Captain', 'Picard', 'Enterprise', 'am', 'huge', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'fan', 'watch', 'reruns', 'time', 'never', 'recognized', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'voice', 'cartoon', 'deer', 'one', 'subtitle', 'choices', 'movie', 'information', 'such', 'skunks', 'are', 'gentle', 'animals', 'flying', 'squirrels', 'do', ""n't"", 'fly', 'glide', 'son', 'likes', 'movie', 'deserve', 'several', 'viewing.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'simple', 'hide-and-seek', '3D', 'computer', 'game', 'little', 'kids', 'son', 'enjoyed', 'while.I', 'recommend', 'movie.P.S.I', 'had', 'problems', 'starting', 'DVD', 'brand-new', 'player', 'would', 'start', 'just', 'fine', 'Disney', 'Logo', 'then', 'will', 'die', 'blackness', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'see', 'FBI', 'warning', 'button', 'such', 'fast', 'forward', 'menu', 'works', 'would', 'stop', 'start', 'again', 'may', 'make', 'first', 'blackness', 'previews', 'will', 'kick', '10', 'minutes', 'then', 'blackness', 'again', 'time', 'even', 'stop', 'button', ""n't"", 'work', 'My', 'player', 'little', 'palm', 'mean', 'button', 'pushed', 'disabled', 'DVD', 'why', 'then', 'push', 'open/close', 'button', 'open', 'close', 'push', 'play', 'again', 'immediately', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Never', 'did', 'get', 'see', 'FBI', 'warning', 'there', 'saw', 'later', 'when', 'watched', 'DVD', 'computer', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'wrong', 'player', 'suspect', 'fault', 'more', 'do', 'Disney', 'anti-piracy', 'plans', 'player', 'being', 'plugged', 'VHS', 'recorder', 'Disney', 'movies', 'are', 'heavily', 'copy-protected', 'can', 'only', 'record', 'DVD', 'movie', 'have', 'Digital', 'Video', 'Stabilizer', '30', 'legal', 'make', 'backup', 'copies', 'movies', 'own', 'own', 'protection', 'protection', 'four-year-old', 'sticky', 'omnipresent', 'fingers', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'stabilizer', 'am', 'too', 'lazy', 'record', 'stuff', 'know', 'ever', 'want', 'Disney', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop']",N/A

The story takes place chronologically within the first film, occurring somewhere in the latter half of the first film.It fits nicely, storywise, and the animation tries to recreate the painterly images of that film from several decades ago. It's beautiful, with gorgeous colors and landscapes. It is easy to get hypnotized by the individual, undulating waves of grass, or the shimmering water effects.The characters looks great, and the vocal talent is terrific. My wife commented that she even liked this Thumper's voice more than the first one...Like the original, there are some fairly serious moments here.

But there are also scenes that are surprisingly touching and moving.The score knowingly adapts the original; even one of the characters refers to it in a humorous aside.While the movie doesn't have the hyperverbal, post-modern self-awareness of the latter day Disney (read: Pixar) films, it has plenty to entertain adults and mesmerize the little ones.So many of the previous direct-to-video Disney movies have a cheap, second-hand, ""Saturday morning"" look to them.This one looks terrific.",4,Probably the best direct-to-video Disney sequel.,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,1482,"['have', 'say', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'Bambi', 'II', 'was', 'almost-three-year-old', 'son', 'Ben.We', ""'ve"", 'seen', '30', 'times', 'now', 'new', 'one', 'Bambi', 'II', 'new', 'sequel', 'beloved', 'justly', 'celebrated', 'classic', 'story', 'place', 'chronologically', 'first', 'film', 'occurring', 'somewhere', 'latter', 'half', 'first', 'film.It', 'fits', 'nicely', 'storywise', 'animation', 'recreate', 'painterly', 'images', 'film', 'several', 'decades', 'ago', 'beautiful', 'gorgeous', 'colors', 'landscapes', 'easy', 'get', 'hypnotized', 'individual', 'undulating', 'waves', 'grass', 'shimmering', 'water', 'effects.The', 'characters', 'great', 'vocal', 'talent', 'terrific', 'wife', 'commented', 'even', 'liked', 'Thumper', 'voice', 'more', 'first', 'one', 'original', 'are', 'fairly', 'serious', 'moments', 'here', 'central', 'plot', 'focuses', 'relationship', 'Bambi', 'father', 'pretty', 'cold', 'begin', 'winced', 'more', 'harsh', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'moving.The', 'score', 'knowingly', 'original', 'even', 'one', 'characters', 'refers', 'humorous', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'hyperverbal', 'post-modern', 'self-awareness', 'latter', 'day', 'Disney', 'read', 'Pixar', 'films', 'plenty', 'entertain', 'adults', 'mesmerize', 'little', 'ones.So', 'many', 'previous', 'direct-to-video', 'Disney', 'movies', 'have', 'cheap', 'second-hand', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'look', 'them.This', 'one', 'terrific']",N/A
938102,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000B8QG3G,Monty Moonlight,"[18, 22]","Young Bambi has just lost his mother to a hunter's will, and he is left alone in the forest to fend for himself. Bambi's father, the Great Prince of the Forest, is urged by Friend Owl to take responsibility for the boy, and the Great Prince agrees, but only till Spring. During the time they spend together, the serious and preoccupied Great Prince learns what it means to be a father, while Bambi learns what it means to gain a father and lose a mother at the same time. Bambi also goes through the more expected trials of growing up. Along with his friends, Thumper and Flower, Bambi deals with the difficulties and dangers of girls, bullies, hunters, and proving himself to others. The real story here, of course, is about the developing relationship between a father and a son, which culminates in a very touching and perfect moment of pure Disney magic.""Bambi II"" is a masterfully done piece of filmmaking that is the ultimate proof that Disney animated classics CAN have worthy and wonderful sequels. Set amidst events from the original film, ""Bambi II"" picks up right from the moment Bambi calls for his mother after her death in the classic and carries on to the first sprouting of his antlers and disappearance of his spots. Subtle and not so subtle touches link this sequel beautifully with the original masterpiece, including some intense encounters with Man's dogs and Bambi's struggles with Ronno, another male fawn whose attempts to gain friends make him more of a bully than anything else. Including Ronno was a stroke of genius, and those who want to see where these confrontations lead to need only view the original ""Bambi."" Ronno is the buck that Bambi clashes with over Faline when they are all adults. What makes ""Bambi II"" such a success while so many other Disney animated sequels have been considered failures? Three main reasons: One, ""Bambi II"" uses real kids' voices for the kid characters, while many direct-to-video animated films, and animated films in general, use adults. Trust me, it makes a BIG difference in the believability of an animated film. Two, ""Bambi II"" does not simply rehash the plot of the first film or make up a very contrived plot just for the sake of making a sequel. ""Bambi II"" shares an important and natural part of Bambi's story that was simply left unknown before. Three, ""Bambi II"" was made by Disney's current master animators; the guys who worked on stuff like ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast."" These legendary artists should not be relegated to direct-to-video sequels, but they certainly prove that they can make such subjects every bit as big-screen-worthy as their previous triumphs. Hopefully, someday ""The Man"" will realize that 2D-animation for the big-screen is not dead, and then maybe I'll be re-inspired to become a Disney animator, as was my childhood dream. After all, I'm only 30, and ""Bambi II"" certainly stirred up some of those feelings within me once again.There's hardly an unkind word that can be said about ""Bambi II,"" and it would fit seamlessly into the context of the original 1942 film were it not for one thing: the songs. Much of the background music incorporates the score from the original ""Bambi,"" but there are a few new songs, and I still am not a big fan of including modern-sounding songs in sequels to Disney animated classics. Even when the songs aren't bad, they take away from the illusion that you're watching something continuing or in the context of a MUCH older film. Here, we have original songs performed by female country music stars that we know weren't around during the making of the original film, and they just seem out of place in a story that is set during the events of the original ""Bambi."" Luckily, the songs aren't that frequent and aren't TOO much of a distraction. Had the film been set after the original, perhaps they wouldn't have seemed so out of place. I had the same problem with ""Return to Never Land,"" though. That was a good film compared to other Disney sequels, but I really didn't care for the pop music in a story set during World War II. However, it had other flaws that ""Bambi II"" manages to avoid.An outstanding film that receives my highest recommendation, ""Bambi II"" is only available for a VERY short time! Being only a single-disc version with very few extras, however, we may see a 2-disc release in the future, but who knows how long that will take?! I wouldn't wait around if I were you! If you found the first film's heavily artistic mood a bit dull, this film is still deserving of a test viewing. It's much more lively than the first in terms of action and adventure. Remember, it's the story of a boy living with his father this time around. Extras include a ""find Thumper"" type game for the kiddies called ""Thumper's Hurry and Scurry Game,"" a fun ""Disney Sketch Pad"" clip where we get to see legendary animator Andreas Deja sketch Thumper with inspiring skill (bringing to mind those old Disney Channel moments that made so many kids dream of working for Disney when they grew up), a Trivia Track that can be run while viewing the movie, and ""The Legacy Continues,"" a behind the scenes featurette that includes interviews with the voice talent, including Patrick Stewart of Star Trek TNG fame who voiced the Great Prince! In addition, you get several previews for upcoming Disney releases, like a Movie Surfers look at Tim Allen's version of ""The Shaggy Dog"" and trailers for the soon to be released ""Fox and the Hound 2,"" ""Brother Bear 2,"" and ""Leroy and Stitch,"" all three coming directly to DVD.  ""Brother Bear 2"" looks rather promising, and Lilo and Stitch are always good. ""Fox and the Hound 2"" looks entertaining but contrived, and it does not look like the next ""Bambi II."" Highly doubtful that it's being done by the same animation team, and I don't think we can expect big-screen quality direct-to-video Disney sequels from anyone else.

No 'son of Bambi' so relax. :D The biggest reason why this was a successful story is that they found a story they could tell that didn't feel forced. In my opinion sequels like Hunchback of Notre Dame II, The Little Mermaid II, and Lady and the Tramp II were sort of fluffy that seemed forced. (Though I'll admit I liked Lady and the Tramp II anyway). Of all the sequels, Bambi II might be closest to Tarzan II. It makes sense in retrospect: if you remember the original, Bambi was a sort of shy, nervous character and he was far more confident in adulthood. He goes through a change in this one.Are the characters faithful to the original? Sort of a tall order when you have a prequel with very little dialogue. Bambi, Thumper, and Flower are all in character. Thumper is especially enjoyable as Bambi's rambunctious little sidekick/buddy. Faline is a little out of character. If you remember the original, Faline didn't do much except giggle and chase after a shy Bambi. This time Faline is a little less obnoxious and more subdued. Its a minor change though, she's not suddenly an alpha female.On the new characters: first, the Great Prince was, well, great! He's stern, serious, and not really up to the challenge of raising a young fawn. But Bambi really needs his guidance and they learn from each other. Its tough to compare to other bumbling Disney fathers, but perhaps he's most like King Triton off the top of my head. Ronno is not a new character. He is the deer that Bambi fights with when he rescues Faline in the first movie. He's your average bully type but he has a purpose in this movie and he was an amusing character.The story made me cry... multiple times. Yes, Bambi and the Great Prince are trying to get over the death of Bambi's mother. She isn't forgotten. These scenes were really well done and touching.

And you know what? I reviewed another Disney product negatively and THAT was pulled too. Conspiracy? You better believe it. Anyway, on with the (original) review - let's see how long it lasts this time. Are we not allowed to give our opinions now or what?Ah, Disney. Where did it all go wrong? When did the once all mighty Mouse House turn into a wretched parody of itself, churning out detestable zero-charm superflops (""Home On The Range"", anyone? Anyone? No, didn't think so) and barrel scraping, legacy tarnashing ""sequels"" to cherished classics. The decline has been a steady one, and its only going to get worse.It seems Disney will go to any lengths to try and scrape some money together now. After the domination of CGI animation (which, in my opinion, ISN'T a good thing), they've tried their luck with just about anything. Milo and Stich 2. Hercules 2. Tarzan 2. The list goes on, but to comission a sequel to the beloved 1940's classic Bambi just proves how desperate they really are.After the riseable ""Home On The Range"" tanked, Disney said they were never going to release another traditional animation movie for the cinema again, merely releasing straight to DVD suck-fests. Here's a heads up to Disney - there's nothing wrong with traditional animation. Your string of laughable failures has NOTHING to do with them not being CGI - it's because they're really, really BAD films. Toy Story did SO well, not because of how it looked, but because of what it was; funny, charming, exciting - everything your movies just. are. not.Disney really need to dig themselves out of a serious rut, and releasing vile garbage like this just isn't going to do it.

It was a huge surprise to find out that a sequel was made.  It was definitely a delightful surprise!  ;)  It's destined to become as much of a classic as the first one was.  It's hilarious, and it picks up right where it left off in the first one.  There is one scene in the movie, however, where little kids might start to cry.  And I don't want to be a spoilsport or anything, but parents, here's a heads-up: Even though it looks like Bambi's died, Bambi is still alive, thankfully!  If Bambi had died, that would have absolutely ruined the whole movie, and I would be rating this movie quite differently.  The movie's really cute, and once kids are aware that Bambi doesn't die, it's a sweet movie that anybody of any age can enjoy.  I'm a teenager and I still enjoy this kind of movie. =)  (Hehe!)  Yes, I'll admit it, too. =)  You should at least rent this movie from Blockbuster or whatever your rental store is near you.  It's a good movie to buy, as well.

938121,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000B8QG3G,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[6, 8]","In recent years, in order to increase the amount of money flowing into their coffers, the Walt Disney Company has made a slew of sequels to classic films which are released direct to video (or DVD). I'm not quite sure, but I believe this model was started with the sequel to ALADDIN, THE RETURN OF JAFAR. Originally, it was just the more modern Disney animated films that got a cheap video sequel:  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, THE LION KING, THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE, etc.  However, to make even more money the Mouse has started making sequels to some of the more classic films in its vaults, such as CINDERELLA and LADY AND THE TRAMP, and one of the latest casualties in this money-(...)-mongering, BAMBI.BAMBI isn't just a classic animated Disney film, it's a classic movie all around. The originally movie attempted to bring life-like qualities to it's all-animal cast. It portrayed nature in a way that had never been done before on film. And it coined another word for cute little deer. BAMBI was fine the way it was. There was no need for a sequel. But, they made one anyway.The film tries to illustrate what happens after Bambi's mother dies and he is forced to be raised by his father, The Great Prince.  The Great Prince tries his best to take care of Bambi, but he doesn't believe he's cut out for the job:  raising a deer is a doe's job.  So, while the wise owl tries to find a suitable doe to raise Bambi, he and his father struggle to live together. In the process, Bambi learns a great deal and has adventures with friends both old and new.BAMBI II does a great job at trying to stay with the spirit of animation from the original movie. The vivid forest scenes both remind one of the scenery in the original film, while at the same time they appear to be much more bright and distinct (due to modern filmmaking).BAMBI II also brings back all the characters from the original film: Bambi, Thumper and his sisters, Flower, and the Owl. It also includes a couple of new characters:  the Groundhog and the Porcupine. However, many of these characters don't act the way they did in the original movie. Bambi is more rambunctious than he was originally, Thumper is more of a wise guy, and Flower doesn't really do anything.Also, the movie has a lot more action than the original movie. There are some scenes that really young children actually might get frightened by (there are a couple of scenes involving vicious dogs). There isn't a whole lot of a plot, but the ending brings together all the little events that happen throughout the movie (the ending also is a homage of sorts to another classic Disney film: THE FOX AND THE HOUND).BAMBI II is an unnecessary film. It doesn't do a whole lot in further developing the characters from BAMBI and it did not need to be made. With that said, the filmmakers have done a good job at trying to remain true to the original film. If you knew nothing of the original movie, you might actually enjoy watching most of BAMBI II and not think to yourself, ""where did they slop this together at."" If you're a huge fan of the original, you might not like this movie. However, children will probably adore it and with a decent message a good animation it's worth renting.The DVD includes a few bonus features.  There's a documentary about the making of this film, there's a really dull game called ""Thumper's Hurry and Scurry"" that anyone over the age of five will be bored with, there's a segment with animator Andreas Deja illustrating how a person can draw Thumper, and some trivia tracks.",4,Better Than Expected.,1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,3532,"['recent', 'years', 'order', 'increase', 'amount', 'money', 'flowing', 'coffers', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company', 'made', 'slew', 'sequels', 'classic', 'films', 'are', 'released', 'direct', 'video', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'believe', 'model', 'was', 'started', 'sequel', 'ALADDIN', 'THE', 'RETURN', 'OF', 'JAFAR', 'Originally', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'modern', 'Disney', 'animated', 'films', 'got', 'cheap', 'video', 'sequel', 'BEAUTY', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'THE', 'LION', 'KING', 'THE', 'EMPEROR', 'NEW', 'GROOVE', 'etc', 'However', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'Mouse', 'started', 'making', 'sequels', 'more', 'classic', 'films', 'vaults', 'such', 'CINDERELLA', 'LADY', 'AND', 'THE', 'TRAMP', 'one', 'latest', 'casualties', 'money-', '-mongering', 'BAMBI.BAMBI', ""n't"", 'just', 'classic', 'animated', 'Disney', 'film', 'classic', 'movie', 'around', 'originally', 'movie', 'attempted', 'bring', 'life-like', 'qualities', 'all-animal', 'cast', 'portrayed', 'nature', 'way', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'done', 'film', 'coined', 'word', 'cute', 'little', 'deer', 'BAMBI', 'was', 'fine', 'way', 'was', 'was', 'need', 'sequel', 'made', 'one', 'anyway.The', 'film', 'tries', 'illustrate', 'what', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'dies', 'forced', 'be', 'raised', 'father', 'Great', 'Prince', 'Great', 'Prince', 'best', 'take', 'care', 'Bambi', ""n't"", 'believe', 'cut', 'out', 'job', 'raising', 'deer', 'doe', 'job', 'So', 'wise', 'owl', 'tries', 'find', 'suitable', 'doe', 'raise', 'Bambi', 'father', 'struggle', 'live', 'together', 'process', 'Bambi', 'great', 'deal', 'adventures', 'friends', 'old', 'new.BAMBI', 'II', 'great', 'job', 'trying', 'stay', 'spirit', 'animation', 'original', 'movie', 'vivid', 'forest', 'scenes', 'remind', 'one', 'scenery', 'original', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'appear', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'bright', 'distinct', 'due', 'modern', 'filmmaking', '.BAMBI', 'II', 'also', 'back', 'characters', 'original', 'film', 'Bambi', 'Thumper', 'sisters', 'Flower', 'Owl', 'also', 'couple', 'new', 'characters', 'Groundhog', 'Porcupine', 'However', 'many', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'did', 'original', 'movie', 'Bambi', 'more', 'rambunctious', 'was', 'originally', 'Thumper', 'more', 'wise', 'guy', 'Flower', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything.Also', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'action', 'original', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'really', 'young', 'children', 'actually', 'might', 'get', 'frightened', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'involving', 'vicious', 'dogs', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'plot', 'ending', 'brings', 'together', 'little', 'events', 'happen', 'movie', 'ending', 'also', 'homage', 'sorts', 'classic', 'Disney', 'film', 'FOX', 'THE', 'HOUND', '.BAMBI', 'II', 'unnecessary', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'further', 'developing', 'characters', 'BAMBI', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'said', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'trying', 'remain', 'true', 'original', 'film', 'knew', 'nothing', 'original', 'movie', 'might', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'most', 'BAMBI', 'II', 'not', 'think', 'where', 'did', 'slop', 'together', ""'re"", 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'However', 'children', 'will', 'probably', 'adore', 'decent', 'message', 'good', 'animation', 'worth', 'renting.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'bonus', 'features', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'really', 'dull', 'game', 'called', 'Thumper', 'Hurry', 'Scurry', 'anyone', 'age', 'five', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'segment', 'animator', 'Andreas', 'Deja', 'illustrating', 'how', 'person', 'can', 'draw', 'Thumper', 'trivia', 'tracks']",N/A
