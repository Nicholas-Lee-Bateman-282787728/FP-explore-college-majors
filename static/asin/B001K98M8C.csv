1207477,A398SM0LR6KLZO,B001K98M8C,Aion,"[27, 31]","First of all, let me say that no aspect of this series is outstanding. Rather than being brilliant at one thing, it's more of a good all-round series. It's a solid series; one that fans of war stories set in the ancient past will get into from the get-go. And, despite the main character having his own harem, it's safe to say the series can be enjoyed even by those who dislike harem series.The story starts with a man getting found injured in the forest near a small farming village. He has a mask, no memories and doesn't have a clue who he is or what he was doing in the forest. He quickly becomes friends with Eluluu, the young healer who found him, and her little sister, Aruruu. He gets given the name Hakuro by the village chief - the name of Eluluu and Aruruu's father.At first all is well but the situation quickly turns ugly. Hakuro has to come up with a tactic to save the villagers from being eaten alive by the angry 'God' of the forest. He does so, and earns the respect of the entire village. Then the local feudal lord pays a visit to the town in order to collect taxes. One of the guards kills the village chief, resulting in Hakuro being named chief, and he helps the angered villagers lead a rebellion against the feudal lord. Hakuro kills him, which leads to the Emperor getting involved in an attempt to avenge his brother.From there, the series takes a path fans of the Suikoden video game series will be familiar with: armies fight, new, super strong allies join and, bit by bit, Hakuro's army grows in power. Soon a mere rebellion transforms into a war between nations, with war after war following Hakuro as he rises to power, as if caused by him. As he continues to become more powerful, staining his hands with more and more blood, the questions of who he is and if what he's doing is right become increasingly troubling.Where the story falls short, after an involving opening and enjoyable middle, is the ending. Prior to the last section of the story, it had been fast-paced bows and arrows warfare. Aside from a few winged magic users, there'd been nothing to suggest the ending would be quite so ridiculous. All of a sudden robots come into the picture, with one nation destroying all others with these machines, and Hakuro's true identity is revealed during the mecha action. In an attempt not to spoil the story, I'll just say that Gods, evolution, space stations, hi-tech science labs, blob monsters, reincarnation, a Godzilla style final battle and all of the usual anime ending stuff you can think of comes into play. I'm not quite sure how to describe it, actually... It's best just to say it ends in a horrible manner and leave it at that. It's a shame because if the series had ended like it started, without all of the seemingly random rubbish, it could've been a top anime.The ending aside, my other story issue lies with the battle tactics. Hakuro's tactics usually come down to him telling people to go left or right and him letting his elite soldiers slaughter the enemy soldiers. With the main character playing the role of tactician and the story being about him quickly rising to power, I expected in-depth, jaw dropping battle strategies. Maybe I was expecting too much? I don't know, but it's fair to say the battles could've been more complex.While on the subject of battles, if you've played any of the Dynasty Warrior games you'll have a good idea how the combat goes in Utaware. The generals are all powerful, killing the grunts with one blow, and the proper, more intense combat involves one on one battles between opposing generals. But the combat isn't very exciting, with some animation recycling occurring and the important fights just simply failing to get my blood pumping. It's a shame because some dodgy, out of place CG aside, Utaware is lovely to look at. The art is appealing, the colours vibrant and, as far as I'm aware, the backgrounds were all drawn by hand, giving them extra charm.To end my story comments on a positive note, I'll end by saying that, if nothing else, the Utaware story is an entertaining one to sit through. The story is always on the move, with there rarely being episodes not focused on the on-going struggles of Hakuro, and it flows excellently from episode to episode. Another story positive is lack of perverted content. I may be little off when I say this but I think the game the anime was based on was an erotic one, involving Hakuro picking one of the female characters to be his girl. While there are elements of this in the plot, in the anime it comes across more like a straight-forward romance that develops in a logical way as the series progresses. The only scene that comes close to crossing the line is one where Karula - a warrior with a HUGE sword and big boobs - offers herself to Hakuro in exchange for his help and almost gets accepted. Overall, the series was highly enjoyable and surprisingly tasteful.In terms of the huge cast of characters, Utaware is a little hit and miss. The cast are more likeable than well developed. The main cast members all stand-out, with most of their names and personalities sticking in my mind straight away, but not many get fleshed out. You learn their quirks and that's it for the most part. Hakuro gets the most time, as you'd expect with him being the main character, but you never see a lot of his past, and what's shown isn't very clear. Eluluu, the female lead, is cute and likeable enough and her interaction with Hakuro and her little sister, Aruruu, adds depth to her character but she very rarely came across like a real person. Aside from those two, only Oboro and Karula get decent development. Oboro fights whilst constantly worrying about his blind and bedridden little sister (some early episodes focus on this subplot) and Karula has her own little story relating to her past. In short, the cast have a lot of likability but fairly limited development, with a lot of the blame for this laying with the series length.As for the music, Utaware has a solid soundtrack. There are some memorable tracks and lots of fitting music that, while unlikely to be listened to outside of the anime, improves the viewing experience. The opening and ending themes are very good, the opening in particular sticking in my mind.All in all, Utaware surpassed my expectations but still ended up disappointing me because of how it ended. Until the final volume I was prepared to score it in the 9-10/10 tier, but it'll have to make do with a solid 8/10 instead. I respect the series for not being perverted despite it being based on an erotic game and having a large cast of attractive females. At worst, you could say it panders to the moe market a little, but there's nothing included that made me think the series was aimed more at perverts than people looking for a good story. I recommend anyone looking for some primitive, bows and arrows war look the series up.Rating: 8/10-----------There's one last, non-vital thing I'd like to touch upon: the DVD extras.Included on the Utaware DVDs is a four part omake series. These short episodes focus on light-hearted fun - very different from the usually serious main story, and I rated the omake series 9/10; one point higher than the main series. Why the rating, you ask? Because the omakes are hilarious. I'm not the sort of guy who roles around laughing, but even I laughed during the third episode when, after Oboro had broke her doll, Touka went insane, beating the crap out of Oboro and making some of the most weird and amusing screams I've ever heard. I loved how Hakuro left the room after seeing Touka's bloody hand and crazy expression, leaving Oboro to his fate (once again!).Do yourself a favour and watch the Utaware extras. You won't regret it.",4,"Difficult to remember title, easy to remember story.",1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,7749,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'aspect', 'series', 'outstanding', 'Rather', 'being',

1207479,A18JORXY0YARAX,B001K98M8C,Anne with an e,"[3, 7]","Do you like epic war scenes?  Do you like harem shows with no comedy?  Do you like funky ears?  Do you like it when all the non-important characters look almost exactly the same and die off in droves?  Do you like your villains to have sexy silver hair?  Do you like strange and unexpected plot twists that don't make a lot of sense?  Then this is the show for you!When I bought this I had no idea what it was about other than what it said on the box, but hey, cheap anime.  And it starts off pretty decent.  There's this guy, and he doesn't know who he is, where he came from, what he's doing, or how he came to be passed out in the middle of a forest with severe injuries.  The show starts there, with his recuperation with the aid of a couple cat (or dog?) girls and their wise old grandma.  Through his gentle but authoritative persona he gains the trust of the village and eventually (about 3 episodes in) the leadership position of a rebellion against the repressive emperor of their country.  So far so good.  Then he wins!  Hurray, good show!  Wait, no, that's not even close to the end.  The real meat of the show lies in following the mysterious Hakuoro as emperor of a country, fighting to keep it free while struggling to remember his own strange and mysterious past.  And also the show is about the activities of his collection of fine ladies.  Okay, there are three or four other guy characters who get a chunk of time, but that's mostly in the show's first ten episodes.  They get pushed to the side pretty early in favor of the ladies.The show basically has three plot arcs, and while the first two are entertaining, with epic wars and stuff, the last one is pretty disappointing with its slow moving start, surprise mecha, and frustratingly dumb conclusion.  The mystery of his mask is solved, but it is a disappointment, mostly because of what it does to the setting of the story.  It raises more questions than it answers, but these are the kind of questions that make you start picking apart the mechanics of the world and setting and shake your willingess to invest in the plot.  Just for example: how does magic work if this is in fact a science fiction setting rather than the epic fantasy it had been for the first 24 episodes?  A bad ending can ruin a show, and this one has a lot riding on the resolution of what's behind that mystery mask.  And in this case, what's back there is, well, if you watch a lot of  anime or play JRPGs, you can probably guess from the first teaser flashback in the very first episode to a degree what his secret turns out to be.  Except more silly somehow.At any rate, animation wise this is pretty solid for the most part.  The characters generally stay on model, but there is quite a bit of conspicuous CG in the wide battle scenes, and that can get distracting if you dislike that sort of thing.  The character designs are pretty cute overall, though you can always tell the bad guys by their pretty silver hair.  Seriously.  As far as voice performances go, the dub is decent and the music is all right.  The ending song in particular is actually pretty pleasant.  The dvds are incredibly basic: the main menu is just a list of episodes and a language menu.  The clean opener and ender are part of that list on the third disk, though they don't play automatically like the episodes do.  Trailers are on the fourth disk.  Very, very basic stuff, but this is the cheap set, so you get what you pay for.  The cover, by the way, is reversible so you don't have to have the S.A.V.E. binder sticking out if you don't want to.TL:DR summaryPlot: 2Characters: 3Animation: 3Music: 3Overall: 2  Endings make it or break it for me, and this one breaks it.",2,All red shirts must die!,1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,3702,"['Do', 'epic', 'war', 'scenes', 'Do', 'harem', 'shows', 'comedy', 'Do', 'funky', 'ears', 'Do', 'when', 'non-important', 'characters', 'look', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'die', 'off', 'droves', 'Do', 'villains', 'have', 'sexy', 'silver', 'hair', 'Do', 'strange', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'twists', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'Then', 'show', 'When', 'bought', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'other', 'what', 'said', 'box', 'hey', 'cheap', 'anime', 'pretty', 'decent', 'guy', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'where', 'came', 'what', 'doing', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'passed', 'out', 'middle', 'forest', 'severe', 'injuries', 'show', 'there', 'recuperation', 'aid', 'couple', 'cat', 'dog', 'girls', 'wise', 'old', 'grandma', 'gentle', 'authoritative', 'persona', 'gains', 'trust', 'village', 'eventually', '3', 'episodes', 'leadership', 'position', 'rebellion', 'repressive', 'emperor', 'country', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'Then', 'Hurray', 'good', 'show', 'Wait', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'end', 'real', 'meat', 'show', 'following', 'mysterious', 'Hakuoro', 'emperor', 'country', 'fighting', 'keep', 'free', 'struggling', 'remember', 'own', 'strange', 'mysterious', 'past', 'also', 'show', 'activities', 'collection', 'fine', 'ladies', 'Okay', 'are', 'three', 'four', 'other', 'guy', 'characters', 'who', 'get', 'chunk', 'time', 'mostly', 'show', 'first', 'ten', 'episodes', 'get', 'pushed', 'side', 'pretty', 'early', 'favor', 'ladies.The', 'show', 'basically', 'three', 'plot', 'arcs', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'entertaining', 'epic', 'wars', 'stuff', 'last', 'one', 'pretty', 'disappointing', 'slow', 'moving', 'start', 'surprise', 'mecha', 'frustratingly', 'dumb', 'conclusion', 'mystery', 'mask', 'solved', 'disappointment', 'mostly', 'what', 'setting', 'story', 'more', 'questions', 'are', 'kind', 'questions', 'make', 'start', 'picking', 'apart', 'mechanics', 'world', 'setting', 'shake', 'willingess', 'invest', 'plot', 'Just', 'example', 'how', 'magic', 'work', 'fact', 'science', 'fiction', 'setting', 'rather', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'had', 'been', 'first', '24', 'episodes', 'bad', 'ending', 'can', 'ruin', 'show', 'one', 'lot', 'riding', 'resolution', 'what', 'behind', 'mystery', 'mask', 'case', 'what', 'back', 'well', 'watch', 'lot', 'anime', 'play', 'JRPGs', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'first', 'teaser', 'flashback', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'degree', 'what', 'secret', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'silly', 'somehow.At', 'rate', 'animation', 'wise', 'pretty', 'solid', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'generally', 'stay', 'model', 'quite', 'bit', 'conspicuous', 'CG', 'wide', 'battle', 'scenes', 'can', 'get', 'distracting', 'dislike', 'sort', 'thing', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'pretty', 'cute', 'overall', 'can', 'always', 'tell', 'bad', 'guys', 'pretty', 'silver', 'hair', 'Seriously', 'As', 'far', 'voice', 'performances', 'go', 'dub', 'decent', 'music', 'right', 'ending', 'song', 'particular', 'actually', 'pretty', 'pleasant', 'dvds', 'are', 'incredibly', 'basic', 'main', 'menu', 'just', 'list', 'episodes', 'language', 'menu', 'clean', 'opener', 'ender', 'are', 'part', 'list', 'third', 'disk', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'automatically', 'episodes', 'do', 'Trailers', 'are', 'fourth', 'disk', 'Very', 'very', 'basic', 'stuff', 'cheap', 'set', 'get', 'what', 'pay', 'cover', 'way', 'reversible', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'S.A.V.E', 'binder', 'sticking', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'to.TL', 'DR', 'summaryPlot', '2Characters', '3Animation', '3Music', '3Overall', '2', 'Endings', 'make', 'break', 'one']",N/A

When he awakens, he has no memory. Grandmother gives him the name Hakuoro. He is, however, well educated in many ways. He decides to stay with the villagers and help them in their tough time. An oppressive emperor rules over the land and brings hardship to his people. In a sad twist of fate, Eruru's Grandmother is killed. The villagers rally behind the masked man, now known as Hakuoro, and begin to launch a rebellion against the emperor, whom they soon defeat. After Hakuoro becomes emperor, his past comes back to haunt him. His friends are loyal and stick with him no matter what he has done. Eruru becomes his anchor, and gives him the strength to fight for what's right. As their success grows, more nations join them and fight with Hakuoro and the others. The action and drama are fantastic.This anime got weirder as it progressed. It's kind of like a cross between Inuyasha and Record of Lodoss War. I really enjoyed it. It has a great story, great voice actors, a great soundtrack and great animation. As I said, toward the end it gets kinda strange. All of a sudden, mecha, high tech research labs and cloning are taking place in a feudal age world. It doesn't get too far out though. It's easy to follow at least. The drama and action are amazing. The only complaint I can really have is that Hakuoro and Eruru didn't realize each others feelings till the end. There was plenty of time to develop that, but they didn't.

She takes him to her grandmother Tuskuru, the village healer, and the two of them nurse him back to health. When he wakes up they are surprised to find that he is unable to answer any of their questions - he just can't remember anything! He doesn't understand why he is wearing a mask or why he is unable to remove it. But despite his oddities, the man, now dubbed Hakuoro, is a natural leader and soon the villagers look to him to guidance.When I heard the premise of this show I thought it sounded intriguing. And it was curious - who was Hakuoro and what was that mask for? The characters were not very deep, but they were entertaining. The world the series is set in is interesting. Why do all of the girls have animal ears and tails? Hakuoro proves to be an unexpectedly interesting character and his rise in power was particularly fun. But there were times in which the series moved slowly and they spent too much time on the cute little girls with tails. But it was still fun to watch. Except that you start to get frustrated with the main plot line. You start to wonder if you will ever lean the secret behind that darn mask and such. For about 24 episodes you are left in the dark, with only small flashes of memory from Hakuoro to give you hope for an answer. Then bam! the end hits and things are thrown all topsy-turvy. What you thought was a fantasy story turns out to have mecha. Historical setting? Ha! But worst of all, when the series ends, you have more questions then when it started! If it hadn't been for the stupid ending, this series would have been a solid 4 star anime.If a confusing and pointless ending doesn't bother you, then by all means, go ahead and get this series. It isn't very expensive and for the most part it is entertaining. The Omake are hilarious and you should make sure to watch them (NOTE: I originally watched this series on the individual DVDs, then bought the SAVE edition.

The story focuses on a mysterious man wearing a partial mask who's found by the granddaughter of the village healer with no memory of who he is the healer give him the name of Hakuoro,  Hakuoro is quickly befriended by the villagers, the healer's granddaughter Eluluu and after gaining her trust Eluluu's younger sister Aruruu.  Than he finds out that the villagers are being basically bullied by the local lord and his son and after one of the lords soldiers mistakenly kills the healer who's both well loved and respected by the villagers helps lead them to an uprising against the lord, and later the emperor himself since the lord was the younger brother of the emperor and the emperor wanted revenge against the villagers for rising against him.  Thus we come to the main story plot of the series Hakuoro becomes the new leader of the country after the emperor is killed and with help of his entourage of friends and loyal allies tries to bring stability and harmony to the new country of Tuskuru(Named an reverence to the village healer).  The series has a wide cast of characters throughout the series you'll grow greatly fond of and cheer for with their victories, and sadly there are scenes that will cause you to shed a few tears as some characters you grow fond of are killed as well as a few other touching scenes.  The series will also have some humor in it so it won't be all dramatic but it is bloody so I'd advise people who have young kids to be cautious, that's not to say they can't watch it but if you feel that the scenes are to blood for your kids than just fast forward over them.  Also they have some light adult scenes not any nudity or hentai scenes but more of attempted seductions and flirtations between some of the characters.  The video is wide-screen sharp and clear as always with these recent anime series and the voice cast for the English and Japanese actors was incredible they played their roles right on the money.  Sadly if your a fan who likes the extras like commentaries and the such you won't get that with this box set it only has the standard textless intro/ending songs and some trailers that's it.

While doing so, by force of his character, he draws in a number of side-kicks who are intriguing and engaging.My only two gripes with this series were: (1) things get a little nutty at the end and what was a simple fantasy story eventually brings in all kinds of weird from large monster battles to weird futuristic past flashbacks and religious complexities that take a lot of thinking to keep up with, and (2) while i understand the aesthetic of suffering and stoicism that are so tied up with Japanese mythic narratives, i still am a big fan of quasi happy endings. this one is mostly happy...but still.In all, i found myself racing through this series, not being able to control my desire to see what would happen next.
