I will get the third season after but I hear that others may not come on DVD but I know you can get them on video. The show is the best but like other people said maybe the first season was not the best but I thought it was good and I loved the theme song it had for that season.

976223,A3T2V257AME9SP,B000EQ45BU,A.B.,"[6, 8]","The Facts of Life was a great series involving the lives of mentor Mrs. Garrett and students Natalie, Blair, Jo, and Tootie at the Eastland School for girls. (Let's not forget about Julie Anne Haddock, Molly Ringwald, Julie Piekarski, and Felice Schacter -- season one girls.) The show started out in Eastland dorm and later moved to (season 2) the cafeteria where Mrs. Garrett was to keep and eye on the girls for distroying the kitchen catering van. When Season 5 arrived Mrs. Garret recieved a job offer from her son to open her own gourmet food shop, which she nervously accepted, forcing Mrs. Garrett to quit Eastland and all the girls moving in to help her out. 2 years later, the shop was destroyed by an fire and Mrs. Garrett announced she is tired of her store ""Edna's Edibles."" The girls convince Mrs. Garrett to become partners in a new business Over Our Heads (a trendy boutique -- and might I add very 80's and cool looking). In 1986 Mrs. Garrett falls in love with an old flame, gets married and moves to Africa, to run the house and the shop her sister Beverly Ann comes to Peekskill (Emmy and 8 Academy Award(s) Winning Actress -- Cloris Leachman). The series ended in 1988 with a marvelous 9 year run and is now a cult classic to many people around the world.The first DVD should include seasons one and two: 29 episodes in all.1- 1 101 24 Aug 79

It had comedy but easily tackled issues young people were facing such as drugs, sex, and simply morals and things like self-esteem.This DVD release does what few first season sets don't; it packs in two seasons, includes some actually good extras that includes interviews with some key cast members, and simply gives the fans of the show what they wanted. The transfer to DVD seems okay or decent. The extras, as mentioned, were good ... they included interviews of some of the women who played the girls in the first season (and made a few appearances in season 2).I didn't remember the show being as funny and engaging as it was from the start into the second season when the cast was downsized and focused on a select few. The writing wasn't too cheesey and the plots were fresh and still are today. This is one of those shows, and DVD releases, that I'd have to say is a ""must own.""

By season two, The show  was streamlined to four students (and the core of the show for the rest of the show's life).This career move was the best for the show.I enjoyed watching this show> it had messages shows like about self images, rumors and gossip, Teen weddings, Suicide and others subjext you think a comedy show wouldn't do. They did it and it workes wellThe first season  had too  many girls to enjoy and get to know. The show was great in its first season, however I usually got confuse between Julie Piekarski amd Julie Anne  Haddock characters.Also it seemed Felice Schacter and Lisa Whenchel character were so similar, you can put the lines in either mouth and it woulkd work. And then there was young Molly Ringwall a few years before her 16 Candles days.It was the second year when the core group of GIRLS...Blair (Lisa Whelchel), Tootie (Kim Fields), Natalie (Mindy Cohn) and Jo (Nancy McKeon).... murphed into making this show into something special.My take on this 29 episode DVD set is just like the Theme song, You take the good , You take the bad...Its the Facts of Life. It is fun and barely date itself and that what make it worthwhile--I wonder why TV land doesn't run this show  on their schedule.

976234,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000EQ45BU,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","A successful spin-off from ""Diff'rent Strokes"", THE FACTS OF LIFE ran for 10 years, spawned three telemovies and definitely won a cherished place in the hearts of those who grew up with it.  The series follows Mrs Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae) as she leaves her position as housekeeper for the Drummond family, and becomes housemother to the girls at Eastland Private School in Peekskill NY.The first episode of THE FACTS OF LIFE (""Rough Housing""), featured guest appearances from the cast of ""Diff'rent Strokes"" (Gary Coleman, Dana Plato, Todd Bridges and Conrad Bain), a device used mainly to help lure audiences into the new show, and to re-establish the character of Mrs Garrett in a different environment.  Gary Coleman would often make fleeting guest appearances, and also turns up for the first story of Season Two (""The New Girl"").THE FACTS OF LIFE follows the everyday lives of the girls at Eastland, a private boarding school in upstate New York.  Mrs Garrett acts as moral guide and support to her charges, a rag-tag group of teenage girls whose lives are anything but dull.  The spotlight later shifts to four specific girls who become the key characters from Season Two onward: self-absorbed ""teen queen"" Blair (Lisa Whelchel), jokester Natalie (Mindy Cohn), sassy Tootie (Kim Fields) and tough new girl Jo (Nancy McKeon).This DVD set includes all the episodes from Seasons One and Two; plus a new reunion featurette with the original girls.

976238,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000EQ45BU,Dorrie Wheeler,"[7, 7]","The Facts of Life-The Complete First and Second Seasons in many ways can be called ""The tale of two shows."" The first season of The Facts and Life took place on a different set with several different girls and a few extra cast members. A good way to refresh your memory is remember growing up when you used to watch re-runs of The Facts of Life and you would see like different girls like Sue Ann and a few others and every storyline didn't quite include Blaire? Well that was season one. Season two is when the show shaped into the sitcom it would be for many years. Nancy McKeon joined the cast as Jo and a core group of the girls Blaire, Tootie, and Natalie were subject to live in an loft over the kitchen under Mrs. Garrets close supervision due to sneaking out one night and stealing the schools van.The Facts of Life is one of those family friendly late 70's early 80's shows that many people have fond memories of watching. Watching it as an adult I pick up on things I didn't before. Little jokes Tootie would make that didn't make sense then it's like ""Oh I get it."" Like one joke about Mrs. Garrett's former husband and Natalie questioning why hey divorced and Tootie said something along the lines of ""He must not have been doing something right."" Just little things. The significance of Blaire being upset at the thought of her mother having an affair (at like 6 or 7 I didn't even know what an affair was).The Facts of Life is a cute show that addresses topics that teens of the 80's had to deal with. That being said, it doesn't mean today's teens won't relate to the show, it just seems like many moons ago and their problems seem far more simple than the issues teens of today's shows like South of Nowhere and Degrassi The Next Generation deal with.The 4 DVD box set, released by Sony, is similar in design to The Different Strokes DVD box sets.

976242,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B000EQ45BU,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","I grew up watching this show. Re-watching these episodes bring back a lot of memories for me. We all had our favorites. My older sister loved Jo, my younger sister loved Natalie, I - being the only male in the household, favored Blair. Although I didn't follow the show from the beginning (I was far too young during the shows first couple of seasons), I did catch most of these episodes on re-runs in the late 80's. Today, watching these episodes as an adult brings a whole new perspective. Many deals with very serious topics- sexuality, divorce, bullying, shoplifting, suicide, and are discussed in a light-hearted manner while throwing in some laughs as well. The first season is an almost different show. Before the show was re-tweaked for Season 2, the cast had far too many characters, but at the centre of it all was the always gracious and motherly, Mrs. Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae).  Season 2 brought on a more focused show with the cast reduced to Blair Warner (Lisa Welchel), the pretty, rich blonde; Natalie Green (Mindy Cohn), the comedic, aspiring writer; her best friend, Dorothy ""Tootie"" Ramsey (Kim Fields), who despite her childish charm, created some mild chaos in several episodes due to her constant gossiping; and the no-nonsense, in-your-face Joanne ""Jo""  Polniaczek (Nancy McKean), who despite her rough exterior ended up getting along with most of the girls with the exception of the resident rich girl Blair.Although most of these episodes are worthy of a view and contain more than a few laughs, my personal favorites from Season 1 are:Rough Housing - In this episode, we are shown the nasty side of Blair Warner. Sensing competition from the other pretty blonde of the group, Cindy (Julie Anne Haddock) for the upcoming Harvest Queen pageant, she maliciously insinuates Cindy likes girls.Like Mother, Like Daughter - Again with Blair at the fore-front, this time she is shamed when her very young and attractive mother comes for a visit to Eastland and is caught smooching with a married man.I.Q - When nosy Tootie finds a list of all of the girls I.Q scores and blurts them out, it creates resentment. Especially when Sue Ann (Julie Piekarski) who is considered the smartest amongst her peers, is exposed as having the lowest I.Q of them all. The final test scene between Mrs. Garrett and Mr. Bradley (John Lawlor) is a hoot.Emily Dickenson - Blair uses a poem written by Emily Dickenson and hands it in as her own creation. Her ""poem"" is highly praised but ultimately exposes her as a fraud.Dieting - When Sue Anne get teased about her weight from Blair, she begins starving herself.During season 1, the character of Natalie is very under-utilized. It will not be until Season 2 and beyond, when Natalie is finally given her moments to shine and unmasks Mindy Cohn as a delightful comedienne. The character of Jo (Nancy McKean) is brought in for season 2 and introduced to those watching, a charming tomboy, with some really rough edges who was proud, determined, but hiding a soft-spot. Although her and Blair would find it increasingly difficult to get along right up to the show's final season. My personal highlights of Season 2 are:The New Girl (Parts 1 and 2) - Introduces us to Jo Polniaczek- The no nonsense teen from the Bronx. Her clashing with the snobby Blair is almost immediate.Shoplifting - In order not to be outdone by the wealthy Blair, Jo and the other girls decide to steal a blouse from a trendy boutique for Mrs. Garrett for her birthday.Gossip - When Tootie feels left out by her older room-mates, she decides to get revenge by spreading some gossip involving Blair and Nancy's boyfriend. However when her gossip involves Mrs. Garrett, it threatens not only  Mrs. Garrett's reputation, but her future in Eastland.Sex-Symbol - When Natalie's study date spreads a rumor that he and Natalie went all the way, the girls (including Natalie .. at first) are appalled. But when Natalie misinterprets the girls laughter and comments as mocking, she decides to fuel the gossip in order to shut them up and prove that she is too can be a sex-symbol.For those wanting a little bit of nostalgia with a little added charm and humor, I wholeheartedly recommend this set (and the other seasons that have been released on DVD). Although some of the humor is forced, and at time, Mindy Cohn appears to be laughing at her own jokes - LOL, when the show works, it works. Also, practically everyone can identify with a lot of these characters and the topics being discussed. Times and fashions have definitely changed since these girls were in Prime-Time but the issues they bring to the forefront and the humor live on.Now release the rest of the seasons on DVD please.",5,The Fun Facts of Life,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,4705,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'Re-watching', 'episodes', 'bring', 'back', 'lot', 'memories', 'had', 'favorites', 'older', 'sister', 'loved', 'Jo', 'younger', 'sister', 'loved', 'Natalie', 'being', 'only', 'male', 'household', 'favored', 'Blair', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'show', 'beginning', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'shows', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'did', 'catch', 'most', 'episodes', 're-runs', 'late', '80', 'Today', 'watching', 'episodes', 'adult', 'whole', 'new', 'perspective', 'Many', 'deals', 'very', 'serious', 'topics-', 'sexuality', 'divorce', 'bullying', 'shoplifting', 'suicide', 'are', 'discussed', 'light-hearted', 'manner', 'throwing', 'laughs', 'well', 'first', 'season', 'almost', 'different', 'show', 'show', 'was', 're-tweaked', 'Season', '2', 'cast', 'had', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'centre', 'was', 'always', 'gracious', 'motherly', 'Mrs.', 'Edna', 'Garrett', 'Charlotte', 'Rae', 'Season', '2', 'brought', 'more', 'focused', 'show', 'cast', 'reduced', 'Blair', 'Warner', 'Lisa', 'Welchel', 'pretty', 'rich', 'blonde', 'Natalie', 'Green', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'comedic', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'best', 'friend', 'Dorothy', 'Tootie', 'Ramsey', 'Kim', 'Fields', 'who', 'childish', 'charm', 'created', 'mild', 'chaos', 'several', 'episodes', 'due', 'constant', 'gossiping', 'no-nonsense', 'in-your-face', 'Joanne', 'Jo', 'Polniaczek', 'Nancy', 'McKean', 'who', 'rough', 'exterior', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'along', 'most', 'girls', 'exception', 'resident', 'rich', 'girl', 'Blair.Although', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'worthy', 'view', 'contain', 'more', 'few', 'laughs', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Season', '1', 'are', 'Rough', 'Housing', 'episode', 'are', 'shown', 'nasty', 'side', 'Blair', 'Warner', 'Sensing', 'competition', 'other', 'pretty', 'blonde', 'group', 'Cindy', 'Julie', 'Anne', 'Haddock', 'upcoming', 'Harvest', 'Queen', 'pageant', 'maliciously', 'Cindy', 'likes', 'girls.Like', 'Mother', 'Daughter', 'Again', 'Blair', 'fore-front', 'time', 'shamed', 'when', 'very', 'young', 'attractive', 'mother', 'visit', 'Eastland', 'caught', 'smooching', 'married', 'man.I.Q', 'When', 'nosy', 'Tootie', 'list', 'girls', 'I.Q', 'scores', 'blurts', 'out', 'resentment', 'Especially', 'when', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'Julie', 'Piekarski', 'who', 'considered', 'smartest', 'amongst', 'peers', 'exposed', 'having', 'lowest', 'I.Q', 'final', 'test', 'scene', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'Mr.', 'Bradley', 'John', 'Lawlor', 'hoot.Emily', 'Dickenson', 'Blair', 'poem', 'written', 'Emily', 'Dickenson', 'own', 'creation', 'poem', 'highly', 'praised', 'ultimately', 'fraud.Dieting', 'When', 'Sue', 'Anne', 'get', 'teased', 'weight', 'Blair', 'starving', 'herself.During', 'season', '1', 'character', 'Natalie', 'very', 'under-utilized', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'Season', '2', 'when', 'Natalie', 'finally', 'given', 'moments', 'shine', 'unmasks', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'delightful', 'comedienne', 'character', 'Jo', 'Nancy', 'McKean', 'brought', 'season', '2', 'introduced', 'watching', 'charming', 'tomboy', 'really', 'rough', 'edges', 'who', 'was', 'proud', 'determined', 'hiding', 'soft-spot', 'Blair', 'would', 'find', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'get', 'along', 'right', 'show', 'final', 'season', 'personal', 'highlights', 'Season', '2', 'are', 'New', 'Girl', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'Jo', 'Polniaczek-', 'nonsense', 'teen', 'Bronx', 'clashing', 'snobby', 'Blair', 'almost', 'immediate.Shoplifting', 'order', 'not', 'be', 'outdone', 'wealthy', 'Blair', 'Jo', 'other', 'girls', 'decide', 'steal', 'blouse', 'trendy', 'boutique', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'birthday.Gossip', 'When', 'Tootie', 'left', 'out', 'older', 'room-mates', 'get', 'revenge', 'spreading', 'gossip', 'involving', 'Blair', 'Nancy', 'boyfriend', 'However', 'when', 'gossip', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'not', 'only', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'reputation', 'future', 'Eastland.Sex-Symbol', 'When', 'Natalie', 'study', 'date', 'rumor', 'Natalie', 'went', 'way', 'girls', 'including', 'Natalie', '..', 'first', 'are', 'appalled', 'when', 'Natalie', 'girls', 'laughter', 'comments', 'mocking', 'fuel', 'gossip', 'order', 'shut', 'up', 'prove', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'sex-symbol.For', 'wanting', 'little', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'little', 'added', 'charm', 'humor', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'set', 'other', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'humor', 'forced', 'time', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'be', 'laughing', 'own', 'jokes', 'LOL', 'when', 'show', 'Also', 'practically', 'everyone', 'can', 'identify', 'lot', 'characters', 'topics', 'being', 'discussed', 'Times', 'fashions', 'have', 'definitely', 'changed', 'girls', 'were', 'Prime-Time', 'issues', 'bring', 'forefront', 'humor', 'live', 'on.Now', 'release', 'rest', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'please']",The Facts of Life -

976246,A213FO12B3XYV3,B000EQ45BU,Iceblue,"[2, 2]","3 great things about this show, no, make it 4:1. 2 seasons worth to start with, so more episodes to look forward to.  29 make up this combo.  Could be at least 44 given the current season average is 22, but TFOL didn't exactly get off to a smooth start.  It didn't air all the way thru the first season and changes had to be made for 2nd to happen.2. Everything's closed captioned.  Except the bonus section, that is (would be nice if it is, though).3. The show was done for 9 seasons in all, so some stuff I missed I'll finally get to see, provided the remaining seasons are released.4. Easy to watch, not exactly earth-shattering gritty, but fluffy compared to other concurrent sitcoms.My all-time favorite show, the Brady Bunch, only lasted 5 seasons and I've seen *everything* more times than I can possibly remember.  Fortunately, this sitcom ran nearly twice as long and there are a few episodes I've yet to see, some only partly (the one in season 9 where Blair is hospitalized after a car wreck is one of them), but I look forward to finally in their entirety once the rest of the series is released.  Here's hoping sales will continue to be good to justify this!  I understand the sales of seasons 1-2 combo were so good that 3 came out before too long.  I went ahead and ordered all 3 at once.  Watched all in a matter of days.  What a party.The fact that all the episodes are closed-captioned sure helps.  TFOL probably wasn't CC yet when it debuted in 1979, but it was, perhaps by the 4th or 5th season.  I finally got to see the first and second season episodes with CC for the first time, probably ever.Someone else here mentioned a couple of episodes that Nick-at-Nite wouldn't air due to the serious subject matter involved.  It's one from season 1 where Sue Ann collapses from trying to lose so much weight and the one from season 2 where one girl takes her own life after becoming student council president, right?  I don't remember them, but watching them now seemed new to me if I haven't seen them.  I enjoyed them even though it's understandable as to why they've been denied airtime.  I didn't know about them til I read the posts here, but I know TFOL isn't exactly the fluffiest show on earth if you know what I mean.  TFOL does a good job at covering sensitive issues on occassion without being too depressing.I remember how much I enjoyed TFOL in the first season, but was somewhat disappointed when the cast was pared down to 5 people for season 2.  I didn't exactly like how they changed the show, but stuck with it anyway.  I forgot what my thoughts were at the time, but I imagine perhaps TFOL had been struggling in the ratings so they had to move mountains to survive.  Seems the changes worked; it got to run for 7 more years after that.  Not many shows get to last this long.I enjoyed the first 3 seasons.  Hopefully the entire series will be released.

There's rich and sometimes snobbish Blair (Lisa Whelchel) who had more blonde feathered hair than Big-bird. Jo (Nancy McKeon) joined the cast in the second season, and was a tough street-wise girl from NY that also had a very sensitive side. Then there's the funny girl-next-door Natalie (Mindy Cohn), didn't everyone know someone that looked just like Natalie? Tootie (Kim Fields) was the mouthy youngest cast member who always had a smart line (picture Dee from ""What's Happening"" but not at all mean-spirited). Rounding out the cast was Mrs. Garrett (Charlotte Rae) who was nursemaid, seamstress, cook, good friend, listener, and surrogate mother for these girls.There are a total of 29 episodes from Season 1 and Season 2.Here are all the episodes from Season 1 with descriptions and original air dates:Rough Housing (First aired: 8/24/1979)The series opens with a crossover from the Drummonds of Diff'rent Strokes visiting Eastland to see Mrs. Garrett (their ex-housekeeper).

It's Mrs. Garrett to the rescue to help smooth things over.The Return of Mr. Garrett (First aired: 9/7/1979)Mrs. Garrett is surprised by a visit from her ex-husband, who is interested in her again. However, his gambling ways rub off on the girls who begin playing the game that he taught them.I.Q. (First aired: 9/14/1979)Nosey Tootie accidentally comes across a paper which lists the I.Q. scores of each one of the girls. Of course, she repeats this confidential information back to the girls prompting a furor with Nancy and Sue Ann.Overachieving (First aired: 3/12/1980)Tootie's dad comes for a visit and doesn't like the activities that Tootie is up to. Believing Mrs. Garrett is a bad influence, Mr. Ramsey decides to have Tootie removed from Eastland.Emily Dickinson (First aired: 3/14/1980).Blair is so caught up with her latest boyfriend that she forgets to write a poem, so she copies one.Dieting (First aired: 3/21/1980)Blair and Sue Ann kid each other about their weight and Sue Ann takes Blair's comments a little too seriously, dieting, starving herself, and eventually getting sick.The Facts of Love (First aired: 4/4/1980)Mrs. Garrett begins teaching a sex-education class in stark-disagreement with prudish Mr. Bradley.Flash Flood (First aired: 4/11/1980)A flood hits Peekskill which prompts Blair and Tootie to race out to the stables to save their animals. Blair ""falls in love"" with Mr. Bradley when he comes to the girls' rescue.Adoption (First aired: 4/25/1980)Blair sticks here big nose in Natalie's affairs when she finds out that her schoolmate was adopted. Mrs. Garrett convinces Natalie that she's too young to be running after her birth mother because she is too young and not ready for it.Running (First aired: 5/2/1980)Mr. Bradley pits Sue Ann and Cindy against eachother so they can each compete to win a track competition. Both girls wind up hating eachother, and it's up to Mrs. Garrett (as usual) to fix things.Molly's Holiday (First aired: 6/4/1980)Molly is down in the dumps due to her parents' impending divorce.Dope (First aired: 6/11/1980)Blair befriends two girls who she introduces to Sue Ann. All seems to be fine until they learn that their friends are potheads. This episode was dropped from Nick at Nite/TV Land (during it's regular rotation) because of it's ""risque"" content and storyline.Here are all the episodes from Season 2 with descriptions and original air dates:The New Girl (1) (First aired: 11/19/1980)The new year brings a new student, Jo, a tough girl who hot wires the school van and takes off to the Chug-a-Lug bar with Blair, Natalie and Tootie to meet older boys. However, one of the guys they meet happens to be an undercover officer that drags all the girls to jail when they act up (Tootie pours a pitcher of beer over his head!).The New Girl (2) (First aired: 11/26/1980)Mrs. Garrett bails the girls out of jail and announces that they all have been expelled from Eastland.

However, he invites Jo because Harrison is a sexist snob that thinks he can get lucky with Jo.Who Am I?

But it's actually the green eye of jealousy that's bitten Blair. BTW, I love the song and dance routine that caps off the ep with Blair and Geri. Geri Jewell was such a great addition to the cast.Shoplifting (First aired: 12/31/1980)It's Mrs. Garrett's birthday and the girls (except Blair) steal a blouse to give her.Teenage Marriage (1) (First aired: 1/7/1981)Jo's cute little boyfriend, Eddie, surprises her by making a sudden visit to Eastland, but she gets even more of a surprise when he proposes to her.Teenage Marriage (2) (First aired: 1/14/1981)Jo is unsure of whether or not to accept Eddie's proposal but finally decides to go ahead with the wedding.

This is another episode that Nick at Nite/TV Land didn't like to air.Sex Symbol (First aired: 2/4/1981)Natalie hits it off with Neil.  However, rumors fly that Natalie and Neil did more than just study. Natalie encourages the gossip because she doesn't want the girls to think she's inexperienced.The Secret (First aired: 2/25/1981)Shortly after winning an award, Jo learns that her incarcerated father, is getting paroled and that he would like to attend the awards ceremony.Bought and Sold (First aired: 3/4/1981)Blair is selling cosmetics for Countess Calvet's cosmetic company.

As many ""Facts of Life"" fans might agree, Season One was horrific.

It's a spin off of Different Strokes and revolved around Mrs Garrett and revolved around the four different girls.  Blair -spoiled and rich, Natalie - a smart Alec, Jo - the rebelious one of the bunch and Tootie - the gossiper.  They were in a school called Eastland and they all pretty much grew up in front of our eyes.This show was so funny and fun, and I can't wait to re-watch these episodes that I once knew like the back of my hand.  I don't know if this will be a hit for kids who are school age now like we were when this was on, but those in their 30 somethings, will totally enjoy this thoroughly.  It was a show that touched on a few relevant subjects for it's time (cancer and suicide), but it was never a deep deep show.  It touched on subjects that affected the girls characters and that is almost timeless.

This package of first and second seasons on DVD, however, gives us a rare glimpse at what the show could have been had it not changed and where it went to.Rarely shown in reruns today, the first season of The Facts of Life began with Mrs. Garrett leaving her post as the housekeeper of the Drummond home (on Diff'Rent Strokes) to become the house mother of a private girls' school dormatory.  Here we met the original cast of the show, which was much bigger than the four Blair, Tootty, Jo and Natalie that we would know and love with this show.  Thanks to a larger cast, we are given more of an opportunity to see conflict and multiple story lines.This was so much of a time in history to see a show like this.  Not just the obvious things that we poke fun of like the hairstyles and clothes (he who is proud of the haircut or wardrobe they had twenty years ago may cast the first stone).  It was also before political correctness seized and choked the life out of us (Tooty as a black girl on roller skates, the occational jibe about Natalie's weight, mention of a girl being ""strange"" not a lesbian, use of drugs, etc.).  It was about young women growing up and seeing the world in a sweetly neive way, as we all did way back when.  Being put together under a circumstance (in their case, a school) and having to deal with differences and live together in a community.  The neverending tension between smart mouthed Jo and narcistic Blair was played out for years, while Natalie and Tooty would be BFFs.And, I wonder what the show would have been like if they had stuck to the original cast and not made cutbacks.  The producers realized that the girls would not be wearing short shorts in the middle of winter in upstate New York after all.  Molly Ringwald might never have risen to the stardom level she did had she not been cut from this show.  Maybe it would have been an alltogether different experience.

976262,AMZYAGVDQWTS,B000EQ45BU,Reviews No More,"[0, 0]","I always loved this show as a teenager.  In the 80s, it was the one sitcom we could count on that we could relate to for the issues of the day, although some of the topics had to be airbrushed.  Still, we felt that Blair, Jo, Natalie, and Tutti were going through so much of what we were because they were our ages, and we were always guided into making better deciscions than had our parents said the same identical things.  In a way, I have to laugh now, because NBC found a way to get through to my generation by recycling our parents' advice through our peers, and sometimes it worked.  Sometimes we cheered for the girls and did what we wanted to anyway!I always thought it unfair that Julie Piekarski and Felice Schachter got the axe after year one, but had to applaud the addition of Nancy McKeon in season two.  She was exactly what the show needed, and her character played well off Lisa Whelchel's snobby Blair, because the two girls actually learned to respect each other begrudgingly almost from the first.  The show was reduced to crud in the last few years of its run, but I can find no fault in the first two seasons of the show which are my favorite.  If you're an 80s fan and love inoffensive shows with good values, get the Facts of Life--The Complete First and Second Seasons.  It was one of my birthday presents last week, and it takes me back to a more innocent time when I can now say that I'm proud to be my age.",5,The Facts of Life Are All About You.,1157932800,"09 11, 2006",2006,1435,"['always', 'loved', 'show', 'teenager', '80s', 'was', 'one', 'sitcom', 'could', 'count', 'could', 'relate', 'issues', 'day', 'topics', 'had', 'be', 'airbrushed', 'Still', 'felt', 'Blair', 'Jo', 'Natalie', 'Tutti', 'were', 'going', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'were', 'were', 'ages', 'were', 'always', 'guided', 'making', 'better', 'deciscions', 'had', 'parents', 'said', 'same', 'identical', 'things', 'way', 'have', 'laugh', 'now', 'NBC', 'found', 'way', 'get', 'generation', 'recycling', 'parents', 'advice', 'peers', 'worked', 'Sometimes', 'cheered', 'girls', 'did', 'what', 'wanted', 'anyway', 'always', 'thought', 'unfair', 'Julie', 'Piekarski', 'Felice', 'Schachter', 'got', 'axe', 'year', 'one', 'had', 'applaud', 'addition', 'Nancy', 'McKeon', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'show', 'needed', 'character', 'played', 'well', 'Lisa', 'Whelchel', 'snobby', 'Blair', 'two', 'girls', 'actually', 'learned', 'respect', 'other', 'begrudgingly', 'almost', 'first', 'show', 'was', 'reduced', 'crud', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'run', 'can', 'find', 'fault', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'are', 'favorite', ""'re"", '80s', 'fan', 'love', 'inoffensive', 'shows', 'good', 'values', 'get', 'Facts', 'Life', 'Complete', 'First', 'Second', 'Seasons', 'was', 'one', 'birthday', 'presents', 'last', 'week', 'back', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'when', 'can', 'now', 'say', ""'m"", 'proud', 'be', 'age']",The Facts of Life - The Complete First & Second Seasons

It did this by combining the 1970's 'women's buddy show' with a 1980's emphasis on wealth and luxury.Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae), the Drumond's housekeeper, becomes housemother at Kimberly's boarding school in Peekskill New York. The Drummonds make 'special guest appearances' at Eastland into the second season. However, considering it is Kimberly's school, her single guest appearance in ""Rough Housing"" is puzzling. Surely, we would have seen her more?29 episodes make up the combined season. Whomever was in charge of DVD production for this release remembered that the series did not become the cultural phenomena it is remembered as today until the second season. However important to establishing the series (and featuring a VERY young Molly Ringwald) the first season comparatively lacked the oomph which ultimately made the series click.  I'm also pleased that the price is bellow $30 dollars, studios actually want people buying this product as soon as it hits the shelves.During the second season, the 'core' group of girls is paired down to four and their distinctive personalities are emphasized. Livening things up, 'rough' 'Jo' (Joanne)Polniaczek is added to the cast. Former season one regulars Molly Ringwald (Molly)Julie Anne Haddock (Cindy), Julie Piekarski (Sue Ann), and Felice Schachter (Nancy) come back for guest appearances.Season 2 explains how this seemingly disparate group of girls ends up living together. After they are caught sneaking out to the Chugalug bar (The new girl part 2) the girls end up working in the kitchen--with Mrs. Garett always around to dispense advice---in order to be reinstated at Eastland. Realizing they do like working together, the girls follow Mrs. Garrett over when she opens up ""Edna's Edibles"" ('Gossip').Other special episodes include ""The Return of Mr. Garrett"" because Mrs. Garett's ex-husband returns, along with his gambling problem. He is better known to my generation as the father of actor Alan Alda, but Robert Alda is an accomplished actor in his own right.Another good episode is ""The Secret"" because Jo is torn between wanting to show off an accomplishment and being worried what her 'fancy' new friends will ultimately think of her father. This dilemma also reveals that Jo ultimately does care what her peers think of her.Blair also deals with the opinions of others and her own internalized discomfort with 'difference'. Her cousin Geri (played by Geri Jewell) has cerebral palsy. Jewell made television history, becoming the first person with an obvious disability to become a recurring series regular. I was too young to appreciate everything this character did when first seeing the show, but her lines provide insight of what young adult women with disabilities go through.There are two features, but the important thing is that this series is finally on DVD--and two seasons at once!

976267,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B000EQ45BU,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[1, 1]","The Facts of Life premiered when I was already about 21. So I was past the issues that confront adolescents during their school years. But this show was so good, it could be enjoyed by those of all ages. It was warm, funny, and showed teenage girls in a positive light. Each episode had a moral to it, without being too preachy.The characters really were '80s'-types; meaning that they reflected the increasingly conservative mood of the country during the run of the show. In other words, they were more serious-minded, focused, and had a bit more faith in their teachers, than we who were teens in the 70s seemed to. When I was a teen in the early through mid 70s, kids seemed to be wilder (more inclined towards partying, drug-use, drinking, and casual sex). But then, I was a teen before the conservative Reagan-era of the 80s. Teens of the early-80s were entering a new era, where they were beginning to buckling-down, and take their futures seriously. And the characters in the The Facts of Life certainly did so. Of course, they had their basic insecurities, and conflicts, like all teens do.The Jo Polniaczek character was an especially positive role model for girls, since she seemed to be the most strong-willed and intelligent of the bunch. Mrs. Garrett was also excellent as the stern, yet understanding housemother/confidant/guardian for the characters. I do agree with some of the others who commented on the show, regarding how it was best during the first couple of years or so. It was still okay to watch when Mrs. Garrett left the show, but Cloris Leachman just didn't seem to cut it as their new 'mother-figure'. I would definitely recommend this show, both for the 80s nostalgia-factor, and the excellent characters. Just be aware that the first few seasons of the show are the best.",5,Great sitcom about growing-up in the 80s.,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,1803,"['Facts', 'Life', 'premiered', 'when', 'was', 'already', 'about', '21', 'So', 'was', 'issues', 'confront', 'adolescents', 'school', 'years', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'ages', 'was', 'warm', 'funny', 'showed', 'teenage', 'girls', 'positive', 'light', 'episode', 'had', 'moral', 'being', 'too', 'preachy.The', 'characters', 'really', 'were', ""'80s'-types"", 'meaning', 'reflected', 'increasingly', 'conservative', 'mood', 'country', 'run', 'show', 'other', 'words', 'were', 'more', 'serious-minded', 'focused', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'faith', 'teachers', 'who', 'were', 'teens', '70s', 'seemed', 'When', 'was', 'teen', 'early', 'mid', '70s', 'kids', 'seemed', 'be', 'wilder', 'more', 'inclined', 'towards', 'partying', 'drug-use', 'drinking', 'casual', 'sex', 'then', 'was', 'teen', 'conservative', 'Reagan-era', '80s', 'Teens', 'early-80s', 'were', 'entering', 'new', 'era', 'where', 'were', 'beginning', 'buckling-down', 'take', 'futures', 'seriously', 'characters', 'Facts', 'Life', 'certainly', 'did', 'so', 'course', 'had', 'basic', 'insecurities', 'conflicts', 'teens', 'do.The', 'Jo', 'Polniaczek', 'character', 'was', 'especially', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'girls', 'seemed', 'be', 'most', 'strong-willed', 'intelligent', 'bunch', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'stern', 'yet', 'understanding', 'housemother/confidant/guardian', 'characters', 'do', 'agree', 'others', 'who', 'commented', 'show', 'regarding', 'how', 'was', 'best', 'first', 'couple', 'years', 'so', 'was', 'still', 'okay', 'watch', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'left', 'show', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'cut', 'new', ""'mother-figure"", 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'show', '80s', 'nostalgia-factor', 'excellent', 'characters', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'show', 'are', 'best']",The Facts of Life - The Complete First & Second Seasons

976270,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000EQ45BU,Taheen Lopez,"[1, 1]","THE FACTS OF LIFE was a spinoff series of DIFFERENT STROKES that ran on NBC from Friday August 24, 1979 to Saturday May 7, 1988 regarding former housekeeper(Mrs. Edna Garrett)on DIFFERENT STROKES who is now the housemother at the fictional Eastland School all-females private school in Peekskill, New York.The girls in Mrs. Garrett's care included spoiled rich girl Blair Warner(Lisa Whelchel), overweight impressionable Natalie Green(Mindy Cohn), the youngest gossipy Tootie Ramsay(Kim Fields), and eventually the tough, but streetwise Jo Polniaczek(Nancy McKeon)which came aboard in the Fall of 1980 when NBC kicked off the 2nd Season of THE FACTS OF LIFE.The shows 1st Season focused on the troubles of 7 girls and typically revolved around around a centrally morality-based or ""lesson teaching"" theme and the pilot episode attracted controversy due to Lisa Whelchel's character insinuating that her schoolmate Cindy Webster was a lesbian, because of being a tomboy who frequently showed affection for other girls.FACTS OF LIFE's 1979-80 Season also dealth with issues including drug abuse, sex, eating disorders, parental relationships, and peer pressure and the oddity of this sitcoms 1st Season was that even though some of the other girls were obviously older than others, all the girls who lived at the Eastland School dormitory took the same classes together.THE FACTS OF LIFE's 1980-81 Season was retooled extensively since the producers felt their were way too many characters given the limitations and that the plotlines should be more focused to give the remaining girls more room for character development, so 4 of the characters from the 1st Season such as Cindy(Julie Anne Haddock), Sue Ann(Julie Piekarski), Nancy(Felice Schachter), and Molly Parker(Molly Ringwald)were all ousted from the show in the Spring of 1980 while this shows 2nd Season was underway.Unfortunately, THE FACTS OF LIFE did not start out as a ratings winner on Friday nights in its late Summer debut in 1979 or in its second tryout in the Spring of 1980 and had only ranked #74 out of 79 shows on the air in the year-end Nielsen ratings and was NBC's lowest-rated series, so the show was retooled in hiatus and was moved to Wednesday nights where it finally started to flourish in its 1980-1981 Season  ranking at a respectably moderate #26 in the Nielsen ratings.Therefore, at the time THE FACTS OF LIFE became NBC's 4th highest-rated scripted series following LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, FACTS OF LIFE's parent series(DIFFERENT STROKES), and CHiPs and THE FACTS OF LIFE had ranked in the mid and upper 20's in the Nielsen ratings for nearly every season until it hit its 7th Season in the Fall of 1985 and had moved to Saturdays, plus this shows time slot change dropped the ratings down to #31 in its 1986-87 Season and then down to #37 in its 1987-88 Season before it cancelled in the Summer of 1988 when the cast and crew of the show ran out of steam.Overall, THE FACTS OF LIFE was one of my favorite classic sitcoms and it takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch this show at 8:30 PM every Wednesday night on NBC right after DIFFERENT STROKES at 8PM from the Autumn of 1980 thru the Summer of 1981 and when I used to watch this show after FAMILY TIES every Wednesday night from the Fall of 1983 thru the Winter of 1984 and then when I used to watch THE FACTS OF LIFE on Saturday nights before watching 227 and GOLDEN GIRLS.",4,The Facts Of Life are all about you!,1344988800,"08 15,

976271,A2Y7FWT8JD9VIP,B000EQ45BU,"Tamra J. Gibson ""70's tv addict!!!""","[4, 6]","It's been so fantastic to see The Facts of Life from the very begining! Although I liked the first season, the second season was a huge improvement!!! You really got a chance to focus on four great characters, rather than seven that just did'nt have enough airtime to fully develop.Blair Warner: I'd have to say she was my all-time favorite and Lisa Whelchel played her to the hilt!!! Eventhough Blair could be pretty vain and obnoxious, she did it with such great comedic timing!!!Natalie Green: Mindy Cohn was simply adorable. Her lines were so funny that it was very easy to notice she could hardly keep a straight face while saying them! She had the perfect combination of a great sense of humor and that cute little voice that always guaranteed to make you laugh out loud!!!Joe Polnichick: I know I'm probably spelling her name wrong ( I'll edit it later)She was just the right character to give Miss Blair a run for her money! I really liked her tough girl attitude because it made her so unique from the other girls from the first season.Tootie Ramsey: I must say Kim Fields was pretty annoying during the first and second season, but she did manage a few good storylines that really tested her acting skills. I definately was thrilled when she stopped wearing those hideous pigtails and rollerskates, I know she wore them to make her look taller, but it still was annoying.All in all this show has held up well, the dvd quality and packaging are excellent! It was also great to see an on-camera interview with most of the cast! I hope Sony does'nt take too long releasing season 3!!!",5,THANK YOU SONY FOR FINALLY RELEASING THIS GREAT SITCOM OF THE 80'S!!!!!,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,1591,"['been', 'so', 'fantastic', 'see', 'Facts', 'Life', 'very', 'begining', 'liked', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'huge', 'improvement', 'really', 'got', 'chance', 'focus', 'four', 'great', 'characters', 'rather', 'seven', 'just', ""did'nt"", 'have', 'enough', 'airtime', 'fully', 'develop.Blair', 'Warner', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'was', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Lisa', 'Whelchel', 'played', 'hilt', 'Eventhough', 'Blair', 'could', 'be', 'pretty', 'vain', 'obnoxious', 'did', 'such', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Natalie', 'Green', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'was', 'simply', 'adorable', 'lines', 'were', 'so', 'funny', 'was', 'very', 'easy', 'notice', 'could', 'hardly', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'saying', 'had', 'perfect', 'combination', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'cute', 'little', 'voice', 'always', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'loud', 'Joe', 'Polnichick', 'know', ""'m"", 'probably', 'spelling', 'name', 'wrong', ""'ll"", 'edit', 'later', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'character', 'give', 'Miss', 'Blair', 'run', 'money', 'really', 'liked', 'tough', 'girl', 'attitude', 'made', 'so', 'unique', 'other', 'girls', 'first', 'season.Tootie', 'Ramsey', 'must', 'say', 'Kim', 'Fields', 'was', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'did', 'manage', 'few', 'good', 'storylines', 'really', 'tested', 'acting', 'skills', 'definately', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'stopped', 'wearing', 'hideous', 'pigtails', 'rollerskates', 'know', 'wore', 'make', 'look', 'taller', 'still', 'was', 'annoying.All', 'show', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'dvd', 'quality', 'packaging', 'are', 'excellent', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'on-camera', 'interview', 'most', 'cast', 'hope', 'Sony', ""does'nt"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'releasing', 'season', '3']",The Facts of Life - The Complete First & Second Seasons
976272,AKIV6FWJPWZ0Y,B000EQ45BU,"Tara Plumeri ""Snow Bunny""","[2, 2]","They just don't make shows like this for girls to grow up with !!!Almost every episode in the series' short first season plays like a ""Very Special Episode."" Each episode guarantees viewers a little laughter, a few tears, and very important lessons.Cindy is nominated to compete against Blair in the annual Harvest Queen pageant but becomes upset when Blair obliquely accuses her of being a lesbian (""Rough Housing""). Blair discovers her mother kissing a married man and worries that dear old mom is about to ruin yet another marriage (""Like Mother, Like Daughter""). When Tootie finds a list of everyone's I.Q. scores, Sue Ann discovers that she has Eastland's lowest I.Q. (""I.Q.""). Blair learns about sex in Mrs. Garrett's sex ed class, but it takes a hunky delivery boy to teach her about love (""The Facts of Love, AKA Sex Education""). A school project on family trees leads Natalie to reveal that she is adopted, but she has mixed feelings on taking up Blair's offer to find her ""real"" mother (""Adoption""). Molly's parents are heading to divorce court, and even a lamebrain plan cooked up by the other students can't stop them (""Molly's Holiday""). Blair and Sue Ann are allowed to join an exclusive clique of students, but to be truly accepted, they have to smoke marijuana (""Dope"").One Very Important Lesson that the cast learned very quickly is that sometimes TV series are rethought, and sometimes actors get fired. When The Facts of Life returned for a second season in the fall of 1980, Sue Ann, Nancy, Cindy, Molly, and Mr. Bradley were no longer cast members (although the students do make brief appearances in subsequent episodes). Nancy McKeon joins the cast as Jo, a street-smart tough girl who rides a motorcycle and sometimes gets in trouble with the law. She is sent to Eastland in an attempt to tame her wild ways, but she isn't even there a week before she and the girls are thrown in jail and expelled from Eastland (""The New Girl""). They are allowed back in school, but only if Mrs. Garrett takes personal responsibility for their actions. Soon Blair, Jo, Tootie, and Natalie are rooming across the hall from Mrs. Garrett and working in the school kitchen (where Mrs. G is now the dietician). Jo also attempts to elope with her boyfriend (""Teenage Marriage"") and tries to hide the fact that her father was just released from prison (""The Secret"").The series really is a triumph in good casting. Most viewers will be won over by the sparkling cast. The girls truly seemed to be friends - to each other they were growing up and experiencing life lessons together, and in a weird way, teaching the viewers.EXTRA FEATURESThe bonus features can be found on disc one. In the ""Remembering The Facts of Life"" featurette (18:27), casting director Eve Brandstein and actors Kim Fields, Lisa Whelchel, Mindy Cohn, Felice Schachter, and Julie Anne Becker discuss how they came to be involved with the show that was once titled Garrett's Girls. Schachter and Becker touch on their disappointment at be written out of the series at the end of the first season when the producers and the network decided that there were simply too many characters. Plus it is revealed why Tootie wore those roller skates throughout the first season. Brandstein and the producers loved Fields' professionalism and her comic timing, but she was much younger and smaller than her cast mates. Their solution? Cast Fields anyway and put her in roller skates to make her taller.""After Facts"" (3:50) catches up with what the actors listed above have been doing since leaving the series. I won't ruin the suspense, but I'll tell you that one's a teacher, one is a fundraiser, one is a stay-at-home mom with several kids, and two are still acting.",5,~* Garrett's Girls ~*,1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,3726,"['just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'shows', 'girls', 'grow', 'up', 'Almost', 'episode', 'series', 'short', 'first', 'season', 'plays', 'Very', 'Special', 'Episode', 'episode', 'viewers', 'little', 'laughter', 'few', 'tears', 'very', 'important', 'lessons.Cindy', 'nominated', 'compete', 'Blair', 'annual', 'Harvest', 'Queen', 'pageant', 'upset', 'when', 'Blair', 'obliquely', 'being', 'lesbian', 'Rough', 'Housing', 'Blair', 'mother', 'kissing', 'married', 'man', 'worries', 'dear', 'old', 'mom', 'ruin', 'yet', 'marriage', 'Mother', 'Daughter', 'When', 'Tootie', 'list', 'everyone', 'I.Q', 'scores', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'Eastland', 'lowest', 'I.Q', 'I.Q.', 'Blair', 'sex', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'sex', 'ed', 'class', 'hunky', 'delivery', 'boy', 'teach', 'love', 'Facts', 'Love', 'AKA', 'Sex', 'Education', 'school', 'project', 'family', 'trees', 'Natalie', 'reveal', 'adopted', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'taking', 'up', 'Blair', 'offer', 'find', 'real', 'mother', 'Adoption', 'Molly', 'parents', 'are', 'heading', 'divorce', 'court', 'even', 'lamebrain', 'plan', 'cooked', 'up', 'other', 'students', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Molly', 'Holiday', 'Blair', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'are', 'allowed', 'join', 'exclusive', 'clique', 'students', 'be', 'truly', 'accepted', 'have', 'smoke', 'marijuana', 'Dope', '.One', 'Very', 'Important', 'Lesson', 'cast', 'learned', 'very', 'quickly', 'sometimes', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'rethought', 'sometimes', 'actors', 'get', 'fired', 'When', 'Facts', 'Life', 'returned', 'second', 'season', 'fall', '1980', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'Nancy', 'Cindy', 'Molly', 'Mr.', 'Bradley', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'cast', 'members', 'students', 'do', 'make', 'brief', 'appearances', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'Nancy', 'McKeon', 'cast', 'Jo', 'street-smart', 'tough', 'girl', 'who', 'motorcycle', 'sometimes', 'trouble', 'law', 'sent', 'Eastland', 'attempt', 'tame', 'wild', 'ways', ""n't"", 'even', 'week', 'girls', 'are', 'thrown', 'jail', 'expelled', 'Eastland', 'New', 'Girl', 'are', 'allowed', 'back', 'school', 'only', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'Soon', 'Blair', 'Jo', 'Tootie', 'Natalie', 'are', 'rooming', 'hall', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'working', 'school', 'kitchen', 'where', 'Mrs.', 'G', 'now', 'dietician', 'Jo', 'also', 'elope', 'boyfriend', 'Teenage', 'Marriage', 'hide', 'fact', 'father', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'prison', 'Secret', '.The', 'series', 'really', 'triumph', 'good', 'casting', 'Most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'won', 'sparkling', 'cast', 'girls', 'truly', 'seemed', 'be', 'friends', 'other', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'experiencing', 'life', 'lessons', 'together', 'weird', 'way', 'teaching', 'viewers.EXTRA', 'FEATURESThe', 'bonus', 'features', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'disc', 'one', 'Remembering', 'Facts', 'Life', 'featurette', '18:27', 'casting', 'director', 'Eve', 'Brandstein', 'actors', 'Kim', 'Fields', 'Lisa', 'Whelchel', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'Felice', 'Schachter', 'Julie', 'Anne', 'Becker', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'involved', 'show', 'was', 'once', 'titled', 'Garrett', 'Girls', 'Schachter', 'Becker', 'touch', 'disappointment', 'be', 'written', 'series', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'when', 'producers', 'network', 'decided', 'were', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'revealed', 'why', 'Tootie', 'wore', 'roller', 'first', 'season', 'Brandstein', 'producers', 'loved', 'Fields', 'professionalism', 'comic', 'timing', 'was', 'much', 'younger', 'smaller', 'cast', 'mates', 'solution', 'Cast', 'Fields', 'anyway', 'put', 'roller', 'skates', 'make', 'taller', 'Facts', '3:50', 'up', 'what', 'actors', 'listed', 'above', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'leaving', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'suspense', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'one', 'teacher', 'one', 'fundraiser', 'one', 'stay-at-home', 'mom', 'several', 'kids', 'two', 'are', 'still', 'acting']",The Facts of Life - The Complete First & Second Seasons

976275,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B000EQ45BU,Twiddles42,"[3, 4]","This DVD set incorporates the first two seasons of ""The Facts of Life"", which ran for 9 seasons.While I enjoyed the first season, it's easy to see why the show got retooled.  The first season feels like a series of staged ""after school specials"" - oh, these are entertaining, with ""Dope"" being insanely funny (for the right reasons; I was laughing with it rather than at it), but something felt lacking.  It feels too trite.  Worst of all, an episode featuring a tomboy-like girl is worried that she is not ""normal"".  I think the writers were trying to pitch an anti-GLBT message, but the whole episode waffles all over the place and as cowardly as possible.  Or maybe the episode is trying to say girls playing sports is bad.  Either way, the wishy-washy format of this first year shows why it was deemed a ""mid-season replacement"", with only four stories airing in September (with the rest in March-June).Now, the retooled season 2 features only Blair, Natalie, Tootie, and Mrs Garrett from the original ensemble, and a new character - Jo - is added.  Jo also happens to be a tomboy, but she doesn't think she is ""weird"" in any way.  Ably acted, the addition of Jo would help ensure success.The format for season 2 is changed from a stagey, typical-sitcom presentation to one a more dramatic flair, blending drama with comedy and in a far more effective way.  In a word, it was ""innovative"".  And ""effective"".  :)  The season 2 premiere, ""The New Girl"", spares absolutely no time in setting up the new format - complete with conflict and interplay (and a rescored theme tune), and it's in season 2 where the show solidifies its format and, for being over 30 years old (!!!), holds up extremely well.  The same format would work without issue for several seasons, before being retooled again to contrive their remaining together - thanks to puberty and the fact that shows featuring children invariably see children growing up.But season 2 also has an odd running schedule - starting late in November, but continuing to March.  Full-length seasons start in September and continue through to April or May.  But season 2 quickly proved to the execs that this new format was solid and engaging, with a variety of characters one can like and dislike all at the same time, which is what every TV show should strive to have.For some odd reason, I'm impressed by the DVD menus and their layout - the layout of the episodes is fairly straightforward, but the use of color, the original font, and finding promo photographs of cast members shows a fair amount of effort was used in the menus' construction.  many shows' menus feel more generic.Especially with season 2's massive format change, and the honing of some great morals and ethics into compelling 30 minute episode slots, this set is definitely worth a rental or purchase.",5,Nostalgia?
