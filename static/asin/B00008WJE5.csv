748788,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,B00008WJE5,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[13, 19]","I'll admit, season 4 has it's moments. But this is where MASH totally changed from it's original formula of being a screwball comedy (based on the movie's premise) to a ""dramedy."" It still had the Frank Burns/Margaret connection that was still worth loads of laughs. Even Harry Morgan showed signs of promise that his character would be similar to that of his ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" days- brilliant comedic timing. But as the season progressed, MASH itself regressed. Radar, who started off as one of the gang of connivers along with Hawkeye and the gang, began his devolvement into a complete wussy. Why the writers though that made for a good character I'll never know. Klinger, who was great as a background character, along with Father Mulcahy were given way too much camera time with little substance, much less talent, to be a credible character. And the storylines were not nearly as funny as the first 3 seasons. But to season 4's credit, it was funnier than all those that followed once Mike Farrell and David Ogden Stiers' B.J. and Charles characters had shows evolving around them and their uninspired roles. With each season to follow, MASH became less a TV comedy, to an over the top program that was more like a play. There was no longer the character Hawkeye, but Alan Alda playing the character Hawkeye in the play, ""MASH."" The writers and the actors took too much license with their material and became an insult to those who relished their original characters. By the time the final episode came around, it was time for the show to be euthanized, perhaps 7 seasons too late. I dare anyone to compare any episode from the 4th season on to one of the first 3 for comedy and clever writing. MASH simply stunk by the end of the 4th season. But as has always been the case, TV has patted more terrible programs on the back in the blindness of immediacy, handing out awards that when one looks at the recipients now they scratch their head in amazement. When in syndication I can't wait for the first 3 seasons, but they fly by fast. Once the 4th season starts, I do something more valuable with my time, like plucking weeds in my neighbors yard.",2,New beginning? Anything MASH is great? Horse hockey!

748790,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00008WJE5,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 4]","Based on a Richard Hooker novel of the same name, MASH was released in 1970 as a full-length feature film by 20th Century Fox before experiencing widespread success as a groundbreaking television sitcom in the Fall of 1972. The show's brilliant integration of drama and comedy made it one of the most celebrated shows in TV history, culminating in an eleven year prime time series stint. The 1983 series finale of MASH made history as the program with the single largest audience in television history, beating out several SuperBowls and the fabled ""Who Shot J.R."" episode of Dallas. With the proliferation of new television mediums, it's a record likely to never be broken...The sitcom is set in South Korea during American involvement in the Korea War (with M*A*S*H standing for ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital""). Buffered from the front lines by a mountain range and a minefield, the men and women of MASH were tasked with patching up wounded American soldiers. Unique to its genre, the cast of MASH was unusually large. Surgeons Dr. Benjamin Pierce (Alan Alda) and Dr. ""Trapper"" John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers) play the roles of excellent doctors who enjoy women and booze, while Dr. Frank Burns (Larry Linville) and Nurse Practitioner Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit) play foil to the two men's shenanigans (due to a contract dispute, Rogers' character was later replaced by Dr. B.J. Hunnicutt - played by Mike Farrell). The character of Frank Burns was also later replaced by Dr. Charles Emerson Winchester (David Ogden Stiers)...Corporal Max Klinger (Jamie Farr) provides comic relief with his early attempts to procure a discharge by dressing in women's clothing, and Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher) adds flavor to a diverse cast of characters. Also rounding out the cast are Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), Corporal Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff), and Col. Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan)...The MASH (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere ""Welcome to Korea"" in which Trapper John McIntyre receives orders to ship home and is replaced by Dr. B.J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell). Meanwhile, Pierce butts heads with temporary commanding officer Frank Burns as he attempts to say goodbye to Trapper John before he leaves (Pierce was on leave when the orders came in)... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""The Late Captain Pierce"" in which Pierce's father is mistakenly notified of his son's death, and ""The Gun"" in which a wounded colonel's collectable gun turns up missing (prompting Pierce and B.J. to hunt down the culprit)...Below is a list of episodes included on the MASH (Season 4) DVD:Episode 73 (Welcome to Korea)Episode 74 (Change of Command)Episode 75 (It Happened One Night)Episode 76 (The Late Captain Pierce)Episode 77 (Hey, Doc)Episode 78 (The Bus)Episode 79 (Dear Mildred)Episode 80 (The Kids)Episode 81 (Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler)Episode 82 (Dear Peggy)Episode 83 (Of Moose and Men)Episode 84 (Soldier of the Month)Episode 85 (The Gun)Episode 86 (Mail Call, Again)Episode 87 (The Price of Tomato Juice)Episode 88 (Dear Ma)Episode 89 (Der Tag)Episode 90 (Hawkeye)Episode 91 (Some 38th Parallels)Episode 92 (The Novocaine Mutiny)Episode 93 (Smilin' Jack)Episode 94 (The More I See You)Episode 95 (Deluge)Episode 96 (The Interview)The DVD Report",5,One of the Top 5 television series of all time...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,3351,"['Based', 'Richard', 'Hooker', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'MASH', 'was', 'released', '1970', 'full-length', 'feature', 'film', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'experiencing', 'widespread', 'success', 'groundbreaking', 'television', 'sitcom', 'Fall', '1972', 'show', 'brilliant', 'integration', 'drama', 'comedy', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'celebrated', 'shows', 'TV', 'history', 'culminating', 'eleven', 'year', 'prime', 'time', 'series', 'stint', '1983', 'series', 'finale', 'MASH', 'made', 'history', 'program', 'single', 'largest', 'audience', 'television', 'history', 'beating', 'out', 'several', 'SuperBowls', 'fabled', 'Who', 'Shot', 'J.R.', 'episode', 'Dallas', 'proliferation', 'new', 'television', 'mediums', 'record', 'likely', 'never', 'be', 'broken', 'sitcom', 'set', 'South', 'Korea', 'American', 'involvement', 'Korea', 'War', 'M*A*S*H', 'standing', 'Mobile', 'Army', 'Surgical', 'Hospital', 'Buffered', 'front', 'lines', 'mountain', 'range', 'minefield', 'men', 'women', 'MASH', 'were', 'tasked', 'patching', 'up', 'wounded', 'American', 'soldiers', 'Unique', 'genre', 'cast', 'MASH', 'was', 'unusually', 'large', 'Surgeons', 'Dr.', 'Benjamin', 'Pierce', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Dr.', 'Trapper', 'John', 'McIntyre', 'Wayne', 'Rogers', 'play', 'roles', 'excellent', 'doctors', 'who', 'enjoy', 'women', 'booze', 'Dr.', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'Nurse', 'Practitioner', 'Margaret', 'Hot', 'Lips', 'Houlihan', 'Loretta', 'Swit', 'play', 'foil', 'two', 'men', 'shenanigans', 'due', 'contract', 'dispute', 'Rogers', 'character', 'was', 'later', 'replaced', 'Dr.', 'B.J', 'Hunnicutt', 'played', 'Mike', 'Farrell', 'character', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'was', 'also', 'later', 'replaced', 'Dr.', 'Charles', 'Emerson', 'Winchester', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'Corporal', 'Max', 'Klinger', 'Jamie', 'Farr', 'comic', 'relief', 'early', 'attempts', 'procure', 'discharge', 'dressing', 'women', 'clothing', 'Father', 'Francis', 'Mulcahy', 'William', 'Christopher', 'flavor', 'diverse', 'cast', 'characters', 'Also', 'rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Henry', 'Blake', 'McLean', 'Stevenson', 'Corporal', 'Walter', 'Radar', ""O'Reilly"", 'Gary', 'Burghoff', 'Col.', 'Sherman', 'Potter', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'MASH', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'series', 'premiere', 'Welcome', 'Korea', 'Trapper', 'John', 'McIntyre', 'orders', 'ship', 'home', 'replaced', 'Dr.', 'B.J', 'Hunnicutt', 'Mike', 'Farrell', 'Meanwhile', 'Pierce', 'butts', 'heads', 'temporary', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Trapper', 'John', 'Pierce', 'was', 'leave', 'when', 'orders', 'came', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'include', 'Late', 'Captain', 'Pierce', 'Pierce', 'father', 'mistakenly', 'notified', 'son', 'death', 'Gun', 'wounded', 'colonel', 'collectable', 'gun', 'up', 'missing', 'prompting', 'Pierce', 'B.J', 'hunt', 'down', 'culprit', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'MASH', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'Episode', '73', 'Welcome', 'Korea', 'Episode', '74', 'Change', 'Command', 'Episode', '75', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'Episode', '76', 'Late', 'Captain', 'Pierce', 'Episode', '77', 'Hey', 'Doc', 'Episode', '78', 'Bus', 'Episode', '79', 'Dear', 'Mildred', 'Episode', '80', 'Kids', 'Episode', '81', 'Quo', 'Vadis', 'Captain', 'Chandler', 'Episode', '82', 'Dear', 'Peggy', 'Episode', '83', 'Moose', 'Men', 'Episode', '84', 'Soldier', 'Month', 'Episode', '85', 'Gun', 'Episode', '86', 'Mail', 'Call', 'Again', 'Episode', '87', 'Price', 'Tomato', 'Juice', 'Episode', '88', 'Dear', 'Ma', 'Episode', '89', 'Der', 'Tag', 'Episode', '90', 'Hawkeye', 'Episode', '91', '38th', 'Parallels', 'Episode', '92', 'Novocaine', 'Mutiny', 'Episode', '93', 'Smilin', 'Jack', 'Episode', '94', 'More', 'See', '95', 'Deluge', 'Episode', '96', 'Interview', 'DVD', 'Report']",M*A*S*H - Season Four

I suppose that, in my opinion, they were nearer to portraying the insanity of the movie. Potter was more like a real officer than Henry (who was more like the Colonel in the movie) and B.J. lacked the slap-stick of Trapper. Remember, MASH was a stab at the military and was never meant to be taken seriously. Still, this has to rank up there as one of the best series ever produced. Henry Morgan was great, and irreplaceable, in Dragnet; but comes in a distant second to McLean Stevenson (again, this is my opinion) in MASH. Trapper John was such a major part of the movie that it makes no sense to abandon him in the series without so much as a good-bye to Hawkeye (yet they did).

748796,A2RMPXPACNJT9Z,B00008WJE5,"E. Willaims ""EW""","[1, 2]","This season had some pivotal changes. The introduction of two new characters: Colonel Potter taking the place of Henry Blake oand BJ Hunnicut taking the place of ""Trapper"" McIntyre. These characters are far less funny and imaginative that the originals. BJ is just not as exciting. He is kind of boring, and follows behind Hawkeye all the time, pining over his wife.Potter's change may be for the better. He seems to restore some kind of Sanity to the unit. Henry was funny, but comepletely incompetent as a unit leader. Frank was far worse.With all that said, this was still a funny season. I think the funniest episode was ""The Novacaine Mutiny""  where Hawkeye must stand trial for being accused by Frank of mutiny when he takes over for Potter for a while. Antoher famous one was ""The Late Captain Pierce"" when somehow Hawkeye's paperwork gets mixed up and he is thought to be dead. A sentimental one is ""The More I See You"" where Hawkeye's true love who broke his heart is stationed at the 4077. ""The Bus"" was funny, showing that fixing broken body is a lot different from fixing a broken down bus. ""Welcome to Korea"" which showed BJ's initiation into the war was both very serious and funny.""Soldier of the Month"" is hilarious, where Frank gets knocked out by Hot Lips for leaving her only his clothes in his will. ""Mail Call Again"" showed him trying desparately to hold on to his wife by denying his involvement with Hot Lips. This season featured a lot of letters to home. Potter writes to his wife, BJ to his wife and Radar to his mother, all very funny episodes.All in all, I think that season one, season 4 and season 6 are the most pivotal seasons of MASH.

748797,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,B00008WJE5,Flash,"[2, 2]","MASH was one of those television shows that I didn't watch when it was first on. I was just a kid and so maybe the sarcastic humor was just over my head back in those days. But now that I'm older, I've really started to appreciate shows like this one and ""All in the Family"", two of the true classic 1970's sitcoms. The current price for these shows make them a must have.Season 4 of MASH is probably the best of it's 11 seasons. Colonel Potter arrives at the beginning of the season to head the unit. BJ Honeycutt also arrives and is instantly a perfect counterpart and collaborator to Hawkeye's antics. The main thing that struck me is that this season can be viewed in its totality as a self-contained look into the lives of the MASH characters. From the opening arrival of Colonel Potter, in the letters home that the characters write throughout the season, to the last episode where the unit is interviewed by a TV reporter, its like you are given a window into the world of the 4077th. You could give this season to someone who has never watched MASH and for them it would be like watching a long and powerful documentary or mini-series. Of course, they will then want to watch more because the characters quickly become endearing.Overall, there is hardly a bad episode in this 24 episode season. One of the truly best episodes is called ""Hawkeye"" where Captain Pierce is injured in a jeep accident near the home of a Korean family and suffers a concussion. He needs to stay alert and keep himself from falling asleep and so he just keeps talking to the family. Alan Alda is the only MASH character to appear in this episode. It's basically a solo performace and it is incredible.",5,Best Season of M*A*S*H - A Stand Alone Window Into the 4077th,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,1686,"['MASH', 'was', 'one', 'television', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'was', 'just', 'kid', 'so', 'maybe', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'was', 'just', 'head', 'back', 'days', 'now', ""'m"", 'older', ""'ve"", 'really', 'started', 'appreciate', 'shows', 'one', 'Family', 'two', 'true', 'classic', '1970', 'sitcoms', 'current', 'price', 'shows', 'make', 'must', 'have.Season', '4', 'MASH', 'probably', 'best', '11', 'seasons', 'Colonel', 'Potter', 'beginning', 'season', 'head', 'unit', 'BJ', 'Honeycutt', 'also', 'instantly', 'perfect', 'counterpart', 'collaborator', 'Hawkeye', 'antics', 'main', 'thing', 'struck', 'season', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'totality', 'self-contained', 'look', 'lives', 'MASH', 'characters', 'opening', 'arrival', 'Colonel', 'Potter', 'letters', 'home', 'characters', 'write', 'season', 'last', 'episode', 'where', 'unit', 'interviewed', 'TV', 'reporter', 'are', 'given', 'window', 'world', '4077th', 'could', 'give', 'season', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'watched', 'MASH', 'would', 'be', 'watching', 'long', 'powerful', 'documentary', 'mini-series', 'course', 'will', 'then', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'characters', 'quickly', 'become', 'endearing.Overall', 'hardly', 'bad', 'episode', '24', 'episode', 'season', 'One', 'truly', 'best', 'episodes', 'called', 'Hawkeye', 'where', 'Captain', 'Pierce', 'injured', 'jeep', 'accident', 'home', 'Korean', 'family', 'concussion', 'stay', 'alert', 'keep', 'falling', 'asleep', 'so', 'just', 'talking', 'family', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'only', 'MASH', 'character', 'appear', 'episode', 'basically', 'solo', 'performace', 'incredible']",M*A*S*H - Season Four

Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[0, 1]","Part 1: When the third season ended in the spring of 1975 Lieutenant Colonial Henry Blake was discharge and on his way home. Radar comes into the operating room to tell the personal the following announcement. In the traumatic and shocking last scene, a devastated Radar goes into the operating room to tell personal the following announcement Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake who had boarded his plane and was on his way home, his transport plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan it spun into the ocean and their were no survivals. So now we jump ahead to the 4th season in September where the show opens as followed. Maj. Frank Burns has taken full charge and s giving 4077th hell with his usual military regimen as the new CO replacing Lieutenant. Col. Henry Blake after he lost his life en route home. Capt. Hawkeye Pierce arrives back from 3 days R&R in Tokyo riding in a local mans by rickshaw doesn't check in with his commanding officer and heads straight to the shower.  Radar follows him in to break to try to tell him the bad news that Captain Trapper John MacIntyre had received his orders to ship home. Radar tells Hawkeye that they tried to get him for two days and that Trapper got so drunk that he ran naked through the mess tent. Hawkeye wants to go to Seoul to bid his buddy farewell, but Frank refuses. When Radar gets in a jeep to go to Kimpo to collect a replacement doctor, Hawkeye insists on going along to try and catch Trapper before he goes Stateside, even going so far as to run a blockade. Meanwhile at the 4077th Frank and Hot Lips fawn as they look over the new man's record and envisions shaping him into their image. Once at Kimpo, Radar goes off to find the new doctor, while Hawkeye tries to find his friend before he left for home, only to learn he is 10 minutes too late. When Hawkeye meets the new doctor, a Captain BJ Hunnicutt, he was very abrupt with greeting him, still angry that he had missed Trapper. With the introductions over they headed for the jeep only to find that it had been stolen! So when Part 1 ended last week the trio was stuck in Kimpo with no wheels so now the finish to Welcome to Korea Part 2.  So with no transport to get them back to the 4077th Hawkeye decides it's time to visit the officers club, with just one setback: Radar wasn't an officer, being a mere corporal. So Hawkeye borrows some of BJ's captain's bars and gives him a field promotion to Corporal-Captain! When they emerge, they find a jeep belonging to Major-General Cornell Dickering was waiting; it didn't matter that it wasn't theirs, to Hawkeye a jeep was a jeep, so they commandeer it to get back to the 4077th. On the way back, they encounter a farming family using their daughters to check for land mines to protect their cows. A land mine explodes, injuring one daughter, and Radar braves the field to pick her up and bring her to their jeep. Having taken her to the hospital, they continue on their way to the 4077th and blow a tire. A group of locals walks by, and then suddenly disappears. Hawk, BJ and Radar barely change the tire and evacuate as a barrage of gunfire erupts. Presumably out of danger, they meet up with a group of G.I's, only to have shells rain immediately down upon them, and B.J. gets his first taste of war when they have to treat the wounded soldiers. As BJ tries to help the injured men, the physical gruesomeness of one dead soldier makes him physically sick. After a detour to Rosie's bar, they become so rip roaring drunk that only Radar is able to drive them back to the 4077th. Back at camp, B.J falls out of the jeep, landing at Frank's feet with a drunken ""What say ya, Ferret Face?"" indicating that he, like Hawk and his predecessor, Trapper John, won't fulfill Maj. Burns and Houlihan's wishes. Furthermore, Frank gets picked up by the M.P.s for stealing the General's jeep when he shows lousy timing in using it. As the show ends the read of the cast members who are station at 4077 and conclude with the introduction of Harry Morgan as Colonel Sherman Potter.",5,Season Four of Mash Had Changes,1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,4035,"['Part', '1', 'When', 'third', 'season', 'ended', 'spring', '1975', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonial', 'Henry', 'Blake', 'was', 'discharge', 'way', 'home', 'Radar', 'operating', 'room', 'tell', 'personal', 'following', 'announcement', 'traumatic', 'shocking', 'last', 'scene', 'devastated', 'Radar', 'operating', 'room', 'tell', 'personal', 'following', 'announcement', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Henry', 'Blake', 'who', 'had', 'boarded', 'plane', 'was', 'way', 'home', 'transport', 'plane', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'Sea', 'Japan', 'spun', 'ocean', 'were', 'survivals', 'So', 'now', 'jump', 'ahead', '4th', 'season', 'September', 'where', 'show', 'followed', 'Maj.', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'taken', 'full', 'charge', 's', 'giving', '4077th', 'hell', 'usual', 'military', 'regimen', 'new', 'CO', 'replacing', 'Lieutenant', 'Col.', 'Henry', 'Blake', 'lost', 'life', 'route', 'home', 'Capt', 'Hawkeye', 'Pierce', 'back', '3', 'days', 'R', 'R', 'Tokyo', 'riding', 'local', 'mans', 'rickshaw', ""n't"", 'check', 'commanding', 'officer', 'heads', 'straight', 'shower', 'Radar', 'break', 'try', 'tell', 'bad', 'news', 'Captain', 'Trapper', 'John', 'MacIntyre', 'had', 'received', 'orders', 'ship', 'home', 'Radar', 'Hawkeye', 'tried', 'get', 'two', 'days', 'Trapper', 'got', 'so', 'drunk', 'ran', 'mess', 'tent', 'Hawkeye', 'go', 'Seoul', 'bid', 'buddy', 'farewell', 'Frank', 'refuses', 'When', 'Radar', 'jeep', 'go', 'Kimpo', 'collect', 'replacement', 'doctor', 'Hawkeye', 'going', 'along', 'try', 'catch', 'Trapper', 'Stateside', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'run', 'blockade', 'Meanwhile', '4077th', 'Frank', 'Hot', 'Lips', 'fawn', 'look', 'new', 'man', 'record', 'envisions', 'shaping', 'image', 'Once', 'Kimpo', 'Radar', 'find', 'new', 'doctor', 'Hawkeye', 'tries', 'find', 'friend', 'left', 'home', 'only', 'learn', '10', 'minutes', 'too', 'late', 'When', 'Hawkeye', 'new', 'doctor', 'Captain', 'BJ', 'Hunnicutt', 'was', 'very', 'abrupt', 'greeting', 'still', 'angry', 'had', 'missed', 'Trapper', 'introductions', 'headed', 'jeep', 'only', 'find', 'had', 'been', 'stolen', 'So', 'when', 'Part', '1', 'ended', 'last', 'week', 'trio', 'was', 'stuck', 'Kimpo', 'wheels', 'so', 'now', 'finish', 'Welcome', 'Korea', 'Part', '2', 'So', 'transport', 'get', 'back', '4077th', 'Hawkeye', 'time', 'visit', 'officers', 'club', 'just', 'one', 'setback', 'Radar', 'was', ""n't"", 'officer', 'being', 'mere', 'corporal', 'So', 'Hawkeye', 'BJ', 'captain', 'bars', 'field', 'promotion', 'Corporal-Captain', 'When', 'emerge', 'find', 'jeep', 'belonging', 'Major-General', 'Cornell', 'Dickering', 'was', 'waiting', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'was', ""n't"", 'theirs', 'Hawkeye', 'jeep', 'was', 'jeep', 'commandeer', 'get', 'back', '4077th', 'way', 'back', 'encounter', 'farming', 'family', 'using', 'daughters', 'check', 'land', 'mines', 'protect', 'cows', 'land', 'mine', 'explodes', 'injuring', 'one', 'daughter', 'Radar', 'field', 'pick', 'up', 'bring', 'jeep', 'Having', 'taken', 'hospital', 'continue', 'way', '4077th', 'blow', 'tire', 'group', 'locals', 'walks', 'then', 'suddenly', 'Hawk', 'BJ', 'Radar', 'barely', 'change', 'tire', 'evacuate', 'barrage', 'gunfire', 'erupts', 'Presumably', 'danger', 'meet', 'up', 'group', 'G.I', 'only', 'have', 'shells', 'rain', 'immediately', 'down', 'B.J', 'first', 'taste', 'war', 'when', 'have', 'treat', 'wounded', 'soldiers', 'BJ', 'help', 'injured', 'men', 'physical', 'gruesomeness', 'one', 'dead', 'soldier', 'physically', 'sick', 'detour', 'Rosie', 'bar', 'become', 'so', 'rip', 'roaring', 'drunk', 'only', 'Radar', 'able', 'drive', 'back', '4077th', 'Back', 'camp', 'B.J', 'jeep', 'landing', 'Frank', 'feet', 'drunken', 'What', 'say', 'ya', 'Ferret', 'Face', 'indicating', 'Hawk', 'predecessor', 'Trapper', 'John', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fulfill', 'Maj.', 'Burns', 'Houlihan', 'wishes', 'Furthermore', 'Frank', 'picked', 'up', 'M.P.s', 'stealing', 'General', 'jeep', 'when', 'lousy', 'timing', 'using', 'show', 'read', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'station', '4077', 'conclude', 'introduction', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Colonel', 'Sherman', 'Potter']",M*A*S*H - Season Four

BJ with all his practical jokes is still a kinder gentler soul that Trapper ever was. So the humor is a little gentler but still side splitting. Sherman Potter is more of a commander than Blake was.  But he appreciates the talented and good humored Pierce over the excessive military stooge Frank Burns.  Nonetheless there are plenty of good laughs especially as Corporal Klinger strives to get that Section 8.

748801,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B00008WJE5,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[0, 0]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThe fourth season of ""MASH"" is the first one that sees huge changes in casting and in tone.  The departure of McLean Stevenson was addressed by the show's creative staff in the third season finale, but Wayne Rogers' leaving was a more sudden decision that provoked a different way to look at the series as a whole.  Out of this undesirable situation comes ""Welcome to Korea,"" the triumphant hour-long fourth season premiere that galvanized the show in the wake of significant change.""Welcome to Korea"" is a landmark show for the series, being the first of four hour-long premieres in the show's eleven year run(the fifth, sixth, and tenth season premieres also had an extra thirty minutes).  The extra time wouldn't mean anything if there weren't a good story to tell, and as the fourth season opens, Hawkeye's on R&R; while Trapper has suddenly gone home.  The escalating setup features a stunned Hawkeye racing to say goodbye to Trapper with Radar in tow to welcome Trapper's replacement, Captain B.J. Hunnicutt.  Played by Mike Farrell, B.J. is a very different sort of character than Trapper, but a wise alteration to keep the show fresh.  An easygoing family man, he is a gentle counterpoint to Trapper's playboy.  On the way back to the 4077th, Hawkeye, Radar, and B.J. travel through gritty situations that bond them and indoctrinate the fresh-faced newcomer.Though he is only in the episode as a tease at the end, Harry Morgan's Colonel Sherman Potter is immediately intriguing.  In his character's proper introductory episode ""Change of Command,"" Mr. Morgan proves an able replacement for McLean Stevenson.  I give Larry Gelbart and his creative staff credit for trying something new.  Potter is not Henry Blake.  Strict and competent, Potter is also humane, sensible and kind.  He is the best of Henry while adding his own gifts to the equation.  An Army lifer, he is doing his job the best way he can.  An essentially peaceful man with a strong sense of discipline and duty, Col. Sherman Potter is one of the best characters ever created on ""MASH"" and television as a whole.The fourth season of ""MASH"" is the beginning of the maturation of the series.

Where Trapper and Henry Blake had been married men not above a little good-natured adultery, BJ and Colonel Potter are devoted husbands.  Even Hawkeye begins to be rebuffed by nurses.  The earlier seasons were decidedly sillier (a frequent sight was Henry Blake being nearly blown up in comic fashion).  Harry Morgan brings both a no-nonsense military professionalism and a good-natured, common sense approach to military leadership.The one hour opening episode shows Hawkeye returning from a 3 day debauchery to find Frank Burns in command and Trapper just left.  He hikes a ride with Radar to the air base and finds he has barely missed Trapper as Radar picks up B.J.  This wise episode gives the viewer an opportunity to miss Trapper as well prior to establishing, by the end of the episode, that BJ is just as capable of standing up to ""Old Ferret Face"".  In the second episode Frank finds that his Command has lasted just one episode as he is being relieved by ""Regular Army"" (as opposed to the draftees called up into active reserve duty) Colonel Potter.  At first Hawkeye is horrified to find a 30 year career Army officer in command, but by the time they share their first operating room and first trip to the Swamp's still Hawkeye and BJ find that their new CO is a kindred spirit and his experience is a bonus.",5,"Welcome to Korea, BJ and Colonel Potter",1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,1696,"['Perhaps', 'largest', 'transition', 'many', 'eleven', 'year', 'run', 'MASH', 'season', 'addition', 'Mike', 'Farrell', 'new', 'surgeon', 'BJ', 'Hunnicut', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'veteran', 'surgeon', 'three', 'wars', 'Commanding', 'Officer', 'Colonel', 'Sherman', 'Potter', 'Still', 'present', 'are', 'Klinger', 'Radar', 'Frank', 'Margaret', 'ever-present', 'Hawkeye.The', 'tone', 'show', 'shifted', 'significantly', 'Where', 'Trapper', 'Henry', 'Blake', 'had', 'been', 'married', 'men', 'not', 'little', 'good-natured', 'adultery', 'BJ', 'Colonel', 'Potter', 'are', 'devoted', 'husbands', 'Even', 'Hawkeye', 'be', 'rebuffed', 'nurses', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'were', 'decidedly', 'sillier', 'frequent', 'sight', 'was', 'Henry', 'Blake', 'being', 'nearly', 'blown', 'up', 'comic', 'fashion', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'no-nonsense', 'military', 'professionalism', 'good-natured', 'common', 'sense', 'approach', 'military', 'leadership.The', 'one', 'hour', 'opening', 'episode', 'Hawkeye', 'returning', '3', 'day', 'debauchery', 'find', 'Frank', 'Burns', 'command', 'Trapper', 'just', 'left', 'ride', 'Radar', 'air', 'base', 'barely', 'missed', 'Trapper', 'Radar', 'up', 'B.J', 'wise', 'episode', 'viewer', 'opportunity', 'miss', 'Trapper', 'well', 'prior', 'establishing', 'end', 'episode', 'BJ', 'just', 'capable', 'standing', 'up', 'Old', 'Ferret', 'Face', 'second', 'episode', 'Frank', 'Command', 'lasted', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'being', 'relieved', 'Regular', 'Army', 'opposed', 'draftees', 'called', 'up', 'active', 'reserve', 'duty', 'Colonel', 'Potter', 'first', 'Hawkeye', 'horrified', 'find', '30', 'year', 'career', 'Army', 'officer', 'command', 'time', 'share', 'first', 'operating', 'room', 'first', 'trip', 'Swamp', 'still', 'Hawkeye', 'BJ', 'find', 'new', 'CO', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'experience', 'bonus']",M*A*S*H - Season Four
748811,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B00008WJE5,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[3, 5]","I've always thought that television shows are like people. They are born, grow up, grow old, and die. In the fourth season of M*A*S*H, the show officially reached its maturity, transforming from a sophomoric, slapstick farce into a ""dramedy"" of increasing sensitivity and sophistication. Sure, the lowbrow jokes about latrines and the nurses' chest X-rays were still there, but more and more, M*A*S*H became increasingly determined to examine moral and ethical quandaries, the effects of bureaucratic stupidity on human life, and the manifold horrors of war.The third season had ended with the departure of Maclean Stevenson's genial but weak-willed Lt. Col. Henry Blake, and in the hiatus between seasons, the nominal co-star of the show, Wayne Roger's gin-swilling, nurse-chasing Cpt. ""Trapper"" John McIntyre also elected to leave without filming a Goodbye episode. This put the writers and producers in rather a tricky position, as they had to replace two characters in short order without shell-shocking the fans. The skill with which this reshuffling was handled is a testament to producers Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, who rarely saw a curveball they couldn't whack out of the park.As S4 opens, the camp is therefore suffering under the iron-fisted but incompetent leadership of Maj. Frank Burns (Larry Linville) and his sidekick-cum-lover-cum-dominatrix, Maj. Margaret Houlihan (Loreta Swit) who have replaced the dead-and-departed Blake as camp commander. The camp's chief surgeon, subversive, and lothario, Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda), returns from a sake-soaked leave in Tokyo to discover to his horror that his roomate and best friend Trapper has been shipped home in his absence. In his place arrives clean-cut young doctor named B.J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell), who rapidly becomes Hawk's sidekick even as he struggles to acclimatize to conditions in Korea. No sooner has a new routine been established, however, than yet more waves are made by the arrival of a new C.O., Col. Sherman T. Potter (Harry Morgan), who is long  on horse-sense but short on temper. In the mean time, Father Mulcahey (William Christopher) is still struggling to save souls (and feel needed), Corporal Klinger (Jamie Farr) is still trying to cross-dress his way to a Section Eight discharge, and gentle company clerk Walther ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burgdorff) is still quietly holding the camp together with one hand while he clutches his teddy bear with the other. All against the ususal backdrop of bombs, shells, gangrenous limbs, bloodthirsty officers, and Army bureacrats.Season Four boasted an unusual number of outstanding episodes, starting with the first, a two-parter called ""Welcome to Korea"", which introduces B.J. in true M*A*S*H fashion. [In short order he participates in the theft of a general's jeep, gets shot at by a sniper, sees a Korean girl blown up by a mine, witnesses a platoon of American soldiers turned to hamburger by mortar fire, drinks himself senseless at Rosie's bar, and passes out in Margaret's arms.] Other notables include:""Hawkeye"" -  An injured Hawk is stranded with a Korean family that speaks no English. This episode is essentially a one man show, and almost the entire story is shot in a series of long takes on a small indoor set. Outstanding writing and acting couple with a willingness to take heavy creative risks - this is the only episode in which no other cast members appear, even in cameos, and gives Alan Alda a chance to do some first-class stage acting.""The Late Captain Pierce"" - Hawkeye is mistakenly declared killed in action by the Army, a circumstance he finds amusing until he realizes his beloved father has been notified of his ""death."" This episode travels a brutal emotional arc as Hawkeye, unable to contact his dad, goes from said amusement to irritation, aggravation and eventually despair. A classic example of ""dramedy"" in action.""Deluge"" - The Chinese suddenly enter the Korean war against U.S., much to the chagrin of General MacArthur...and the gang at the 4077. As Allied forces fall back from the ""Red hordes"", an unceasing flow of wounded and dying men push the whole staff to - and past - their physical and emotional limits.""The Interview"" - M*A*S*H was often at its best when it ""stepped out of its formula"" completely. This episode is shot in a documentary format, showing the characters from the perspective of the reporter and his audience. There are some particularly outstanding performances here - Alan Alda's bleary-eyed emotional exhaustion; Larry Linville's chilling depiction of Frank's mind; Harry Morgan looking wonderfully uncomfortable and stiff.There are a number of other first-rate episodes as well, including ""Every Time I See You"", ""Smilin' Jack"", and various storylines in which characters write home to their families, a device M*A*S*H somehoe manage to overuse without ever wearing out. There is also a very moving and well-acted story ("""") featuring Sydney Freedman and Col. Flagg in which a bombardier with a head injury wakes up thinking he is Jesus Christ.My only beef with this product is its low physical quality. For only [...], I wasn't expecting a lot of frills, but between the shoddy transfer, the lack of A N Y special features (even a pamphlet with an episode guide) and the nasty tendency of Disc 2 to glitch up, you'd be better off buying a used version of the Collector's Edition.",5,Growing up is painful.,1262563200,"01 4, 2010",2010,5386,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'television', 'shows',

748812,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00008WJE5,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[22, 27]","The success of the 1970 film ""MASH"", which was directed by Robert Altman, inspired the production of one of the most successful and longest running TV series of all time: ""M*A*S*H"".  While most of the main characters from the original film were portrayed in the TV series, only one of the film's actors reprised his role for the TV series: Gary Burghoff.  Like the film, the show was about the men and women working in a fictitious U.S. Army ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital"" (or MASH unit) known as the 4077th during the Korean War in the early 1950's.At the beginning of the show's fourth season, two loved characters were no longer present: Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson, 1929-1996) and Capt. ""Trapper John"" McIntyre (Wayne Rogers), both of whom received orders to return home to the states; but Henry's plane was shot down and he was killed in the final third-season episode making it one of the most emotional and personal episodes of the entire series.  The characters from the first three seasons who remained with the show into its fourth season included Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville, 1939-2000), Maj. Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit), Capt. Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce (Alan Alda), Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher), Cpl. Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff) and Cpl. Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr).  Two new regular characters were then introduced at the beginning of the fourth season to replace Henry and Trapper: Col. Sherman T. Potter (Harry Morgan) and Capt. B.J. Hunnicut (Mike Farrell), both of which remained with the show for its remaining 8 seasons.As in the original 1970 film and the first three seasons of the TV series, ""M*A*S*H"" continued to demonstrate a lack of respect for the U.S. military by portraying many of its officers as being inept and incompetent.  This was the formula used for Maj. Burns and the departed Lt. Col. Henry Blake, but whereas Lt. Col. Blake had a very likeable personality, Maj. Burns wanted to see a more disciplined command and was often quite a stool pigeon.  Also, while being married and regarding himself as being a devout Christian, Maj. Burns maintained a romantic affair with Maj. Houlihan.  (In the film, it was while Majors Burns & Houlihan were passionately kissing with the entire MASH unit listening to them that Maj. Houlihan earned the nickname ""Hot Lips"".)  Captains Hawkeye Pierce and the departed Trapper John McIntyre were typically disrespectful of the Army, but were completely honest about themselves, which is probably the main reason why they despised the hypocritical Maj. Burns so much.  B.J., who replaced Trapper, quickly became Hawkeye's new friend and shared many (but not all) of Hawkeye's views.  As in the film, Maj. Houlihan was particularly attractive, but many weren't particularly friendly towards her because, like Maj. Burns, she wanted to see greater military discipline.  This often set Majors Burns & Houlihan at odds with Hawkeye and B.J.  Though Col. Potter was more regular Army and quite different from Henry Blake, he too was not particularly fond of Maj. Burns and developed close bonds with Hawkeye and B.J., and later with Margaret.  A special bond also developed quickly between Col. Potter and the 4077th's lowly company clerk, Radar.  As always, it was essentially up to Radar to help keep things running smoothly; but the MASH 4077th continued to have the best survival rate for any wounded soldiers treated there.  Hawkeye was an especially gifted surgeon, as were B.J. and Col. Potter; while Maj. Burns had probably barely made it through medical school.  Father Mulcahy was as polite and helpful as ever while Cpl. Klinger continued to wear women's clothes in an attempt to get a ""Section 8"", which would give him a discharge from the Army.The fourth season of ""M*A*S*H"" that aired between 1975 and 1976 had the following 24 episodes:1. ""Welcome to Korea"". With Frank in charge of the 4077th, Hawkeye returns after being in Tokyo for 3 days only to find that Trapper has been sent home.  Desperate to say goodbye to him, Hawkeye takes Radar with him to the airfield; but misses Trapper by 5 minutes; but they find B.J. and stop to have a drink and arrive back at the 4077th drunk with B.J. calling Frank ""ferret face"".2. ""Change of Command"". Frank's command of the 4077th is very short-lived with the arrival of Col. Potter.  Frank then disappears for a few days.3. ""It Happened One Night"". On a very cold night, the 4077th comes under attack from friendly artillery. Frank rips Margaret's tent apart looking for love letters that he had sent to her.4. ""The Late Captain Pierce"". When Hawkeye's father is told that Hawkeye is dead, Hawkeye wants to return home.5. ""Hey, Doc"".  A tank is sent to the 4077th to scare off snipers.6. ""The Bus"".  When the bus that Radar, B.J., Col. Potter, Hawkeye & Frank are riding in while returning to the 4077th from a conference breaks down, they come across a North Korean soldier.7. ""Dear Mildred"". While Col. Potter writes to his wife Mildred for their anniversary, Frank & Margaret have a wood carving made for him, but Radar brings him a horse.8. ""The Kids"". The 4077th takes in orphans that were bombed out of their orphanage.9. ""Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler"".  When a wounded soldier (Alan Fudge) claims to be Jesus Christ, Col. Flagg (Edward Winter, 1937-2001) and Dr. Sydney Freedman (Allan Arbus) have different opinions about him.10. ""Dear Peggy "". B.J. writes home to his wife Peg about Klinger's latest attempt to escape the Army, as well as one of Frank's goofs and a visiting hard-nosed chaplain (Ned Beatty).11. ""Of Moose and Men"". While B.J. helps Sgt. Zale (Johnny Haymer, 1920-1989) with a ""Dear John"" letter, Frank looks for Korean saboteurs and Hawkeye battles with visiting Colonel Spiker (Tim O'Connor).12. ""Soldier of the Month"". When Frank becomes very ill, he writes a will in which he leaves his belongings to his wife; except for his clothes, which he leaves to Margaret.13. ""The Gun"". When a wounded colonel is treated at the 4077th & his valuable gun disappears, Hawkeye & B.J. suspect Frank took it.14. ""Mail Call, Again"". When Frank gets a letter from his wife that she wants to divorce him, a phone call that he makes to her upsets Margaret.15. ""The Price of Tomato Juice"". Radar enlists the help of Hawkeye & B.J. to get Col. Potter some tomato juice, but he's allergic to it.16. ""Dear Ma"".  Radar writes home about Hawkeye's camp foot inspection and Col. Potter getting hit with some shrapnel.17. ""Der Tag"".  Col. Potter encourages everyone to be nicer to Frank.18. ""Hawkeye"".  Hawkeye is injured in a jeep accident and finds refuge with a Korean family that doesn't speak English.19. ""Some 38th Parallels"". Frank tries to sell the camp's garbage to local Koreans.20. ""The Novocaine Mutiny"". After Frank puts Hawkeye on charges while Col. Potter is away, Hawkeye is brought before a court martial where several different versions of what happened are described.21. ""Smilin' Jack"". A wounded chopper pilot (Robert Hogan) is determined to break another pilot's record for the number of wounded brought from the front lines.22. ""The More I See You"". The camp is visited by a nurse who had a previous relationship with Hawkeye.23. ""Deluge"". The 4077th must contend with a deluge of wounded, a fire and a rainstorm.24. ""The Interview"". A visiting reporter, Clete Roberts as himself (1912-1984), visits the 4077th and interviews Hawkeye, B.J., Col. Potter, Radar, Frank, Father Mulcahy and Klinger.Overall, I rate the fourth season of ""M*A*S*H"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  In its eleven years of production, ""M*A*S*H"" was one of the best TV shows of its day and remains one of the best TV shows of all time.",5,Harry Morgan & Mike Farrell Replace McLean Stevenson & Wayne

Stevenson's ""Henry Blake"" was from the ""McHale's Navy"" school of military officers, but moments of wisdom and lucidity gave him depth. Morgan's ""Sherman Potter"" was the exact opposite...played relatively straight with regularly displayed moments of mischief. Farrell's ""B.J. Hunnicutt"" was essentially a more intellectual, less oafish version of ""Trapper John,"" but he was basically brought in to be a partner-in-crime for Hawkeye. That said, the episodes ""Welcome To Korea,"" ""Change of Command,"" and ""The Interview"" are well-known highlights of the series, but ""The Bus"" (following the writers' occasional inclination to script the characters outside of the 4077th) and ""Dear Mildred"" (great ending that I won't spoil here) add up to the reasons why viewers kept coming back to this series week after week.

748814,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,B00008WJE5,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[11, 12]","Season Four of M*A*S*H will always be remembered as the big transitional season, with two major character changes as well as the slow push from ""Comedy with stabs of drama"", to ""Drama with stabs of comedy"".Obviously not everyone enjoyed the changes.  Some fell in love with the early seasons of M*A*S*H for their comical hyjinx and laugh out loud lunacy.  But the actors and filmmakers were constantly testing the boundaries, going for a much more dramatic and/or realistic interpretation of what life at a M*A*S*H station was really like with early episodes such as ""Sometimes You Hear The Bullet"", ""Dr. Pierce And Mr. Hyde"", ""O.R."", and of course the very memorable ""Abyssinia, Henry"".  They realized the positive impact these episodes were having on their audience and would continue to push the envelope with each future season.Season Four gives way to many more serious storylines shown than any previous season.  The opening double episode: ""Welcome To Korea"" welcomes us to Captain BJ Hunnicutt as Hawkeye tries in vein to reach Trapper before he is shipped stateside.  I must admit, I wished there had been a bigger sendoff for Wayne Rogers as Trapper John McIntyre, but he refused to return for even one more episode to say goodbye properly, apparently due to feeling betrayed by the staff who seemed to turn everything into the Hawkeye Pierce show.""O.R."" was the very first (and only) episode without a laughtrack from Season Three.  Season Four would have many more episodes without laughtracks, including ""The Bus""(and enjoyable roadtrip outting), ""Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?"" (the famous episode of a bomber pilot who thinks he's Jesus Christ), and ""The Interview"".""The Interview"", which was shot in black & white to give it a documentary style, is about a news journalist who goes to the 4077 because of its 97% lifesaving success record and interviews the main characters (except for Margaret Houlihan).  Some of the responses were scripted, while others were completely improvisational by the actors who even get to swear obscenities for the first time (but have them bleeped out).  It's a very haunting and realistic episode with William Christopher giving one of the best speeches in M*A*S*H history.  Arguably one of the Top 10 shows of the entire series.Season Four marked the end of M*A*S*H for some...for others, a new beginning.  For those of you who fell in love with the later seasons like I did, I'll see you at the Swamp for a nice dry martini (and future seasons of M*A*S*H on DVD).M*A*S*H Season Four - It only gets better!""When the doctors...cut into a patient...and it's cold, you know...the way it is now, today...steam rises from the body...and the doctor will - will warm himself over the open wound.

748815,A2VPEDJQCOQM9D,B00008WJE5,"Mr. Dana ""Dana_Franklin""","[5, 6]","Other than M*A*S*H, there's only one other show I can watch repeatedly, and still laugh outloud I (Frasier).For the episodes themselves, M*A*S*H has never been better, more convenient, and funnier (thanks to long edited scenes rarely seen in syndicated TV)! It's almost like seeing it for the first time.  I was surprised to notice that many episodes had close to five (5) minutes edited out in Syndication.One allure of DVD's, in addition to the Sound and Picture Quality, are the ""Extras"". Other than the ability to take out the laugh tracks (Yes!), this has none. There are no cast interviews, no bloopers, no Director's/Producers/Writers Commentary, not even Cast Biographies. Even the insert is rather plan and has nothing extra to it. The episode description look as though they were written by some one who hadn't even watched the show. I was hoping for more when the DVD's came out. Like the book ""Complete Book of M*A*S*H"" was not complete in it's fullest sense by leaving out that which would have made it truly complete (the secondary story lines, etc.), this is not complete in the DVD's fullest sense...the extras we've all come to expect in them. In that respect I am disappointed. But I am not disappointed in having a whole season on only 3 DVD's! I am not disappointed in the quality of the sound and picture (much better than the Video's from Columbia House and the Broadcast versions).This season introduces us to the series most significant new characters:  Harry Morgan as Col. Sherman T. Potter (regular Army -- God help us all!!), and Mike Farrel as Cpt. BJ Honnicutt.  While I enjoyed the first three seasons, personally, I like Potter much better than Blake, and BJ more so than Trapper, who had become rather boring (no fault of Wayne Rogers).  So this season I think the show simply got much better, both in comedy and in Drama, something it mixed better than any show before or since.My only other complaint is with their painfully slow release schedule of only two seasons per year. At this rate, it's going to be the end of 2006 before the whole series is available.",5,M*A*S*H Is Number One of All Time!

748817,A3QGRSZ7VTV0SY,B00008WJE5,Rabbi Yonassan Gershom,"[7, 11]","This is the season I've been waiting for -- the year that M*A*S*H evolved from a great comedy to an excellent social commentary.  The previous three seasons had focused mostly on practical jokes and other silly hijinks, along with the whiny relationship between Frank and Margaret.  Some fans consider those the best years of the show in terms of comedy.  But for me, the arrival of Colonel Potter marks the point when I began to really love M*A*S*H as more than ""just another sitcom.""  The humor is still there, but it has grown beyond mere verbal slapstick.In addition, the anti-war focus has become more daring.  One of the most unconventional episodes is the last in the season, ""The Interview.""  It was done in black-and-white like a 1950s newscast, and the M*A*S*H characters tell the folks at home what war is really like for the people at the 4077th..  This episode received very positive feedback when it first aired, and set the stage for including more serious drama in the future.Another of my favorites in Season Four is ""Dear Mildred,"" where Radar gives Colonel Potter a horse for his anniversary -- and the old ex-calvaryman almost cries, he is so touched by the gesture.  ""A horse, a beautiful horse...""  From that moment on, we know that this ""regular Army"" guy has a sentimental side, too.Regarding the format of the DVD set, I was disappointed that the discs themselves were done in olive drab instead of the full-color portraits of the characters on the previous three seasons' discs.  With two new major characters (Potter and Honeycutt) arriving this season, it would have made more sense to feature them on the discs instead of a helmet and a champagne glass.

748818,AEKJ8G550YYW2,B00008WJE5,"Randall Banks ""Music and Movie buff.""","[9, 11]","This year was the beginning of many changes on the show. Unlike most other shows I personally think that MASH got better. More in depth shows. More emphasis on the characters, their families, and their reactions to the war.Hawkeye's cohort Trapper John left the show at the end of season 3. They had to write him out without him actually being there. B.J more than apply filled the role as Hawkeye's ally against the war.Colonel Blake also left after season three. Colonel Potter(excellently played by Harry Morgan) was the total opposite of Henry Blake. Blake was an Illinois doctor who was put in charge of Mash. Potter was a veteran of both world wars, and a former cavalry man.Welcome To Korea - Hawkeye returns from R&R;&R;&R.; Frank is in charge. Hawkeye gives him a box, and says. ""It's a McArthur doll. Wind him up and he returns from anywhere!"" He heads straight for the showers and Radar informs him that Trapper left. Hawkeye, against Frank's orders, heads to Kimpo to try and catch Trapper. He runs a checkpoint, lies to an M.P, but still misses Trapper by 15 minutes.  He does, however, get to meet Dr. B.J Honeycutt. Honeycutt is, like Potter to Blake, the total opposite of Trapper  John McIntyre. He's a straight laced family man with a good sense of humor. They get involved in several surgical incidents on the way back to camp. They stop at Rosie's Bar. ""We need to get him started on his ulcer"" is the reason that Hawkeye gives. The first thing that B.J says upon reaching the 4077th is ""How's it going Ferrett Face"" to Frank. Hawkeye falls down grabbing onto Margaret.Change Of Command -Mail Call Brings some great news. The 4077th is getting a new commander. Hawkeye and B.J are overjoyed until they find that the new guy is a regular army veteran who's not been in surgery for two years. When Potter arrives everyone is on pins and needles. Frank, having not gotten the command, is AWOL. After a night of surgery Hawkeye asks what time it is. B.J tells him and Potter says ""I can use a belt!""  B.J and Hawkeye smile, and invite Potter to the swamp for a few drinks from the still. Their earlier worries were without merit. Potter is fine.The Late Captain Pierce - Klinger wakes up B.J with a phone call from Hawkeye's father.  All B.J can get from Hawkeye's father is ""How and Why?"" This leads to confusion, and Hawkeye stays in the office all night. That next morning, as Hawkeye is heading to the showers, a bus shows up. It's the morgue detail searching for a body. ""I believe Corporal Klinger can assist you in this undertaking"" is Hawkeye's responce. Turns out that the body is Pierce, who's been reported dead. Hawkeye finally gets a hold of his father after having a wake is his honor.The Bus - The doctors, and Radar, are lost after the bus that they are in breaks down. Frnak, on a 2 way radio continuously talks into it, even though everyone tells him that it's mate is at the camp, miles away, way out range, and broken. Frank tries to talk to a fighter, thousands of feet up, moving very fast. A Korean gives up to them, Frank watches him gun at the ready. Eventually, after Frank gets some sleep, the Korean fixes the bus and they head back to camp.Dear Mildred. Potter writes his wife for their 27th anniversay. He tells of how he's adjusting to life at the camp. Meanwhile, Radar talks to B.J and Hawkeye about how he can't get comfortable around Potter. They both assure Radar that Potter is O.K. their conversation is interupted by a chopper bringing mail. The pilot also says that there is a horse that he wants to put out of his misery. Radar, ever the animal lover, convinces Hawkeye and B.J to get the horse. They save the horse which turns out to be the anniversary gift that Radar gives to Potter. Potter an old Cavalry hand is overwhelmed.  Potter slips in manure and Frank says that's gross. Potter however says ""To me that's a tiptoe through the tulips.Dear Peggy - B.J writes home, for the third time that week. ""It's the only way I can keep my sanity"" is his reason. He writes about Klinger's many attempts to escape, which include a huge raft, dressing up like an older Korean woman, and dressing like a bush. He also talks about the taskmaster chaplain that is visiting the camp, much to the dismay of Father Mulcahy.Of Moose And Men - B.J writes a letter for Zale, and fixes his broken hand when he punches a stove. Hawkeye gets the ire of a colonel. Frank's paranoia is at an all time high. He thinks that someone is trying to blow up the camp. He checks his toothpaste for explosives. Classic Frank Burns.Mail Call Again - Frank gets a letter saying that his wife wants a divorce because she knows about Margaret. He calls her and tells her that Houllihan is ""an old war horse"" and ""an army mule with bossoms. Potter finds that he's going to be a grandfather and a pool is set up for guessing the day the child is born.Der Tag - Margaret is on R&R; which makes Frank impossible. To appease him Hawkeye and B.J treat him like a friend. He ends up at the front with a dog tag on his feet that Hawkeye and B.J put there. ""Emotionally exhausted and Morally Bankrupt"" is what is on the dog tag.  Hawkeye and B.J are ordered by Potter to go up and get him. They end up in the middle of a huge push and B.J gets a rude introduction to an aid station.Some 38th Parallels - Frank tries to sell the camp's garabage for profit. Hawkeye, going through some personaly issues, buys it all. A Colonel visit the camp. He's famous for sending troops in, no matter the cost, to retrieve bodies of American soldiers. He's proud of how he got all the bodies and kills ""reds"" even though he lost several other American soldires in doing so. Hawkeye has the garbage that he bought, dropped on this colonel.The Novacaine Mutiny - An attempt to court-martial Hawkeye leads to two very different views of O.R, a poker game, which Frank banned, and a hunt for $300 that was lost in that poker game. ""Gambling has been banned from this camp, therefore the money was stolen."" Frank gets Radar to help him. He searches Mulcahy's tent, Klinger's dresses, of course the swamp, and Radar's belongings.  He never finds if of course, but never accepts that it was lost in a poker game. After the guy overseeing the tribunal to see if charges are warranted says that Hawkeye won't face charges, frank asks him what he thinks of his medical skills. ""If you hadn't been drafted as a doctor, I think you would have been assigned as a pastry chef. The end, which has been cut from many showings, is classic. Must see.Two new members of MASH 4077th didn't change anything except for the role call. Some ways it got a heck of a lot better.

And You can view them whenever you want, with no advertising. Season 4 is outstanding, I will always love the first three seasons best, because love the Blake and Trapper parts, and the whimsical nature of the whole thing; But The Potter and BJ Parts are a great replacement and even better in ways for the above mentioned parts. Season four has many great episodes including the first one, WELCOME TO KOREA, which is a two part episode, that is seamlessly put together as one longer episode hear, which introduces the BJ Part in full and points to the Potter cheater. Other great episodes are Change Of Command, Quo Vadis Captain Chandler, Dear Peggy, Soldier Of The Month, The Gun, Dear Ma, Hawkeye, and the Interview.

The picture quality on these DVDs far outshines the syndicated reruns on TV, and the full 25-minute-plus cuts of the shows haven't been seen in ages. As with the other box sets, the menus and functionality of the disc are very nice. I would however like to see a &quot;play all&quot; button so you don't have to click through as  many menus to see all the shows.As far as the actual content of the shows goes, I enjoy this period in the series more than the earlier seasons. Contrary to what some other fans  think, the addition of Mike Farrell and Harry Morgan improved the show and made it a little more real and less lighthearted. Eventually these new characters really grow on you and become like old friends. The cast changes definitely move the show in a more comedy-drama direction, which I feel is part of what made this show so great, and so different from other sitcoms. A couple of great unconventional episodes are included in this season set, including &quot;Hawkeye&quot;  which is essentially a 25-minute monologue by Alan Alda, and &quot;The Interview&quot; which is an all black-and-white documentary-style episode that again breaks the rules of what a sitcom is &quot;supposed&quot; to be like. Great writing, strong characters, top-notch acting talent. What more could we ask of this show?I can't wait to buy season 5 in December. Now I hope Fox will lavish this same high-quality treatment on more great classic sitcoms like &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, the rights to which I believe they also own.",5,Another Great Season Box Set From Fox,1058313600,"07 16, 2003",2003,1680,"[""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'Fox', 'been', 'good', 'enough', 'release', 'great', 'series', 'DVD', 'have', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'far', 'syndicated', 'reruns', 'TV', 'full', '25-minute-plus', 'cuts', 'shows', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'ages', 'other', 'box', 'sets', 'menus', 'functionality', 'disc', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'would', 'however', 'like', 'see', 'quot', 'play', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'click', 'as', 'many', 'menus', 'see', 'shows.As', 'far', 'actual', 'content', 'shows', 'enjoy', 'period', 'series', 'more', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Contrary', 'what', 'other', 'fans', 'think', 'addition', 'Mike', 'Farrell', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'improved', 'show', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'real', 'less', 'lighthearted', 'Eventually', 'new', 'characters', 'really', 'grow', 'become', 'old', 'friends', 'cast', 'changes', 'definitely', 'move', 'show', 'more', 'comedy-drama', 'direction', 'feel', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'so', 'different', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'couple', 'great', 'unconventional', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'season', 'set', 'including', 'quot', 'Hawkeye', 'quot', 'essentially', '25-minute', 'monologue', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'quot', 'Interview', 'quot', 'black-and-white', 'documentary-style', 'episode', 'again', 'rules', 'what', 'sitcom', 'quot', 'supposed', 'quot', 'be', 'Great', 'writing', 'strong', 'characters', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'talent', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'buy', 'season', '5', 'December', 'Now', 'hope', 'Fox', 'will', 'lavish', 'same', 'high-quality', 'treatment', 'more', 'great', 'classic', 'sitcoms', 'quot', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'quot', 'quot', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'quot', 'rights', 'believe', 'also', 'own']",M*A*S*H - Season Four

Season 4 solves all that. The 20 plus episodes are all, with the exception of one or two, top rate. The first three set up the MASH that will be around the next 2 or 3 seasons, introducing Honeycutt and Potter. Then the series really gets going, showcasing all characters, including Klinger, Radar, Father Mulcahy, and even Sgt. Zale in one bizare setting or another. Larry Linville settles into his snibbling idiot Frank Burns role nicely, and, love or hate the character, this is Loretta Swit's best season by far. Sidney Freeman and Col. Flagg show up and go at it over a soldier who believes he's Jesus Christ.The only time MASH bores me is when they spend an entire episode focusing primarily on one character, particularly Pierce. I didn't care too much for the episodes surrounding Hawkeye's father, or him involved in a jeep accident. Also included is the episode where Hawkeye meets up with his former fiance. What makes MASH great is the seriousness of the medical tasks followed by the complete lunacy of the rest of their lives.

Rivers,"[4, 5]","After three classic seasons, the anarchic spirit of ""M*A*S*H"" came to an abrupt halt with the 1975 departures of McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers. Instead of pulling the plug, producers Gene Reynolds and Larry Gelbart broke away from the original ""M*A*S*H"" concept by gradually turning Season Four into a situation drama with humorous touches. The change in tone created some problems. Gary Burghoff's Radar became an inconsistent childlike figure while Larry Linville's cartoonish Frank Burns wore out his welcome. Though Mike Farrell proved an affable partner in surgery, the strong rapport between Alan Alda's Hawkeye and Rogers' Trapper John was sorely missed. However, veteran actor Harry Morgan had the role of a lifetime as Col. Sherman T. Potter - an inspired replacement for Stevenson's Henry Blake. Regardless of its uneven quality, Season Four offered some memorable episodes: ""Welcome to Korea,"" ""Change of Command,"" ""Dear Mildred,"" ""Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?"" and writer-director Gelbart's groundbreaking swan song, ""The Interview."" Gelbart left ""M*A*S*H"" on a high note, but the series did not follow suit.

748824,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B00008WJE5,Simon,"[5, 5]","Season 4 of MASH marked two distinctive cast changes - Harry Morgan's Colonel Potter replaced MacLean Stevenson's Henry Blake, and Mike Ferrell's BJ Hunnicut replaced Wayne Rogers' Trapper John. It's notable that while most shows usually fall apart after one significant cast change, MASH suffered two in one season - and still went on for another seven years.There's a wealth of strong material this season, and Morgan and Ferrell fit right in. It's nice to finally have an authority figure that can put Frank in his place, and BJ's more of an equal to Hawkeye than Trapper was. Plus, BJ provides a fresh audience viewpoint as he hasn't been in Korea as long as the others have. The change in cast is also accompanied by a slight change in tone, which is natural - MASH as a series matured every season, and season 4 is the natural extension of the more serious moments of season 3.Not that there aren't any funny moments, because there's still several: the introductions of the new characters, Frank Burns in a runaway tank, and an entire episode in the wilderness with a broken bus. The ""letters home"" plot device is used thrice this season, with Potter, BJ, and Radar all reporting on the daily happenings around camp. Two other notable episodes include ""Deluge,"" which is set to old news footage from the 1950's, and ""The Interview,"" a black-and-white episode where the doctors are interviewed in documentary fashion. The only episode that really misses is ""Hawkeye"", where Hawkeye has to continually talk to himself to keep from losing consciousness. MASH works best as an ensemble piece, and listening to 25min of stand-up comedy from Alan Alda doesn't work so well.A quality season that keeps MASH in its prime, even with cast changes.

I will never tire of this show as I have seen some of the episodes so many times I can recite them word for word but they still make me laugh.I really enjoyed the first three seasons with Mclean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers but feel that Harry Morgan and Mike Farrell brought a lot to the show too. Also like how in the later seasons they have more Klinger and Father Mulcahy.This season and season 5 are probably my all time favorites though because they have Harry Morgan and Larry Linville who I also loved in his portrayal of Frank Burns.I guess to wrap it up I just LOVE this show and will never tire of it.",5,My favorite show of all time,1061683200,"08 24, 2003",2003,995,"['love', 'seeing', 'series', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 're-runs', 'years', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'appreciate', 'first', 'time', 'so', 'nice', 'see', 'parts', 'were', 'cut', 'out.M*A*S*H', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'series', 'television', 'only', 'show', 'Korean', 'War', 'also', 'brought', 'forth', 'combination', 'drama', 'comedy', 'much', 'Family', 'will', 'never', 'tire', 'show', 'have', 'seen', 'episodes', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'recite', 'word', 'word', 'still', 'make', 'laugh.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'Mclean', 'Stevenson', 'Wayne', 'Rogers', 'feel', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Mike', 'Farrell', 'brought', 'lot', 'show', 'too', 'Also', 'how', 'later', 'seasons', 'have', 'more', 'Klinger', 'Father', 'Mulcahy.This', 'season', 'season', '5', 'are', 'probably', 'time', 'have', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Larry', 'Linville', 'who', 'also', 'loved', 'portrayal', 'Frank', 'Burns.I', 'guess', 'wrap', 'up', 'just', 'LOVE', 'show', 'will', 'never', 'tire']",M*A*S*H - Season Four

748827,A2HHAV29CZ1OIE,B00008WJE5,TheProf,"[3, 8]","This was one of the best seasons for MASH in my opinion. The show gained more depth with the characters after replacing Henry Blake with Col. Potter and Trapper John with B.J. It wasn't just about carousing and getting drunk but found other outlets for jokes and pranks. Henry Morgan brought such a refreshing change of leadership in the role of regular army man, Col. Potter. His homey wisdom and unique turn of phrase was hilarious! It also seemed that the pairing of pranksters Hawkeye and B.J. was a better fit than Hawkeye and Trapper. While this is not an intellectual masterpiece, MASH is such a good &quot;brain-drain&quot; show after a rough day.",5,A Refreshing Change,1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,655,"['was', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'MASH', 'opinion', 'show', 'gained', 'more', 'depth', 'characters', 'replacing', 'Henry', 'Blake', 'Col.', 'Potter', 'Trapper', 'John', 'B.J', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'carousing', 'getting', 'drunk', 'found', 'other', 'outlets', 'jokes', 'pranks', 'Henry', 'Morgan', 'brought', 'refreshing', 'change', 'leadership', 'role', 'regular', 'army', 'man', 'Col.', 'Potter', 'homey', 'wisdom', 'unique', 'turn', 'phrase', 'was', 'hilarious', 'also', 'seemed', 'pairing', 'pranksters', 'Hawkeye', 'B.J', 'was', 'better', 'fit', 'Hawkeye', 'Trapper', 'not', 'intellectual', 'masterpiece', 'MASH', 'such', 'good', 'quot', 'brain-drain', 'quot', 'show', 'rough', 'day']",M*A*S*H - Season Four

It was the final episode of Season five when Margaret/Hotlips got married and the first (hour-long) episode of season six where Frank Burns left (Larry Linville, according to rumors, didn't want to be casttyped as a whiney by-the-book villain) and Charles Winchester came in.  From then on, I was hooked.Don't get me wrong, though.  I liked the first three seasons of MASH, but it was the characters of BJ and Col. Potter that helped win me over along with Radar, Hawkeye, and Klinger.
