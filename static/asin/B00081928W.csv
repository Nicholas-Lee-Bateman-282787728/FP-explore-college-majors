Mr. Healey did mention that the band was jet lagged.  Perhaps that was it.  They just did not have the sparkle or energy that they normally have.  Even a disappointing show from them is still really good, though.  It is a worthwhile purchase, even if it is not their best effort.",4,A somewhat dissappointing show from a great band,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,418,"['love', 'Jeff', 'Healey', 'Band', 'have', 'quite', 'time', 'now', 'Something', 'was', 'missing', 'show', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pinpoint', 'Mr.', 'Healey', 'did', 'mention', 'band', 'was', 'jet', 'lagged', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'sparkle', 'energy', 'normally', 'have', 'Even', 'disappointing', 'show', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'though', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'even', 'not', 'best', 'effort']",N/A

I could see him playing, but even when the band gets mezzo or softer, nada.  Very disappointing.  Will sample the CD for a better mix.  It's a pleasure to watch him dance and scorch, but the audio has to be just as satisfying.  Well, at least Paddy sounds exceptional...",2,2 and a half stars...Is this just my copy...,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,390,"['am', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'noticed', 'Jeff', 'guitar', 'was', 'extremely', 'low', 'audio', 'feed', '1999', 'concert', 'portion', 'could', 'see', 'playing', 'even', 'when', 'band', 'softer', 'nada', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'Will', 'sample', 'CD', 'better', 'mix', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'dance', 'scorch', 'audio', 'be', 'just', 'satisfying', 'Well', 'least', 'Paddy', 'exceptional']",N/A

JEFF JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER WITH AGE.THE VISUAL AND AUDIO ARE FIRST RATE.HIS PLAYING IS INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. IF YOU LIKE STRAIGHT UP BLUES/ROCK THEN BUY THIS DVD NOW. THE SAD THING IS THAT HE HAD TO GO TO CANADA TO GET SIGNED TO A RECORDING CONTRACT. THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW SCREWED UP THE MUSIC BUSINESS IS TODAY AND HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME......MONEY, MONEY, MONEY EQUALS AMERICAN IDOL, WHILE REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE GET TOSSED ASIDE.

Alot of Jeff's trademark unique blazing guitar work in some rockin blues/rock songs all performed very well. The set list is great, the only negative that I would want it to be longer but they obviously gave us what they had. Jeff's voice sounds great as well as his guitarwork whihc is outstanding. Jeff's transition from the studio to a live stage is really fantastic.The sound is really good recorded in dts, it isn't perfect if you compare it to some of the best music dvd's these days but it is well and truly good enough. The only thing I will say is that sometimes the backing instruments could be a little more powerful but Jeff's guitar is clear and blazing.No complaints about the video, the right things are shot at the right time clearly and again you get some great views of Jeff's fingering on his guitar.All the songs were performed really well with extended solos.. however I was hoping for a little more from stuck in the middle and also While my guitar gently weeps, perhaps my two most anticipated tracks though they were both great, for me just didn't do justice to the studio versions, perhaps I was hoping for a little bit much, but that's just my opinion.Overall A must have for any fan of great guitarist and blues/rock music.",4,"Great show, nearly 5 stars",1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,1346,"['are', 'fan', 'Jeff', 'H', 'concert', 'will', 'pretty', 'much', 'deliver', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'Alot', 'Jeff', 'trademark', 'unique', 'blazing', 'guitar', 'work', 'rockin', 'blues/rock', 'songs', 'performed', 'very', 'well', 'set', 'list', 'great', 'only', 'negative', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'longer', 'obviously', 'gave', 'what', 'had', 'Jeff', 'voice', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'guitarwork', 'whihc', 'outstanding', 'Jeff', 'transition', 'studio', 'live', 'stage', 'really', 'fantastic.The', 'sound', 'really', 'good', 'recorded', 'dts', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'compare', 'best', 'music', 'dvd', 'days', 'well', 'truly', 'good', 'enough', 'only', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'sometimes', 'backing', 'instruments', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'powerful', 'Jeff', 'guitar', 'clear', 'blazing.No', 'complaints', 'video', 'right', 'things', 'are', 'shot', 'right', 'time', 'clearly', 'again', 'get', 'great', 'views', 'Jeff', 'fingering', 'guitar.All', 'songs', 'were', 'performed', 'really', 'well', 'extended', 'solos..', 'however', 'was', 'hoping', 'little', 'more', 'stuck', 'middle', 'also', 'guitar', 'gently', 'perhaps', 'two', 'most', 'anticipated', 'tracks', 'were', 'great', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'studio', 'versions', 'perhaps', 'was', 'hoping', 'little', 'bit', 'much', 'just', 'opinion.Overall', 'must', 'have', 'fan', 'great', 'guitarist', 'blues/rock', 'music']",N/A

LeBaron ""Todd LeBaron""","[3, 4]","I'm not sure I can say anything about this DVD that can sway anyone who hasn't got it yet about this band...to the rest of you who know his music...enjoy! My only comment to one of the other reviewers would be to do your homework. Jeff healey didn't have to go to Canada to get a recording contract. He's Canadian through and through. We're all the more fortunate for having the chance to hear his music. Now that you've heard this...go and investigate Colin James, starting with his ""Sudden Stop"" CD. A live show with these two fine guitarslingers would be the ultimate in my opinion...the other Healey item you need to pick up along the way is the sadly overlooked (at least no US release) ""Get ME Some"", the last studio offering from Healey and his band.
