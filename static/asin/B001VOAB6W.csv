They give performances so natural and compelling that it feels like watching a reality TV show.

It shows the debilitating disease of schizophrenia at it's finest and James Garner thinking he could easily deal with living with his brother who has this mental illness.  Living with schizophrenia is an all consuming task.  The video demonstrated this well.  I'd like to see more movies dealing with this illness.  A Beautiful Mind is one example that I would suggest before I would suggest this movie.  But there are a few valuable scenes to show the frustration of the family member.",4,Promise,1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,601,"['times', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'started', 'grow', 'more', 'continued', 'watching', 'debilitating', 'disease', 'schizophrenia', 'finest', 'James', 'Garner', 'thinking', 'could', 'easily', 'deal', 'living', 'brother', 'who', 'mental', 'illness', 'Living', 'schizophrenia', 'consuming', 'task', 'video', 'demonstrated', 'well', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'dealing', 'illness', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'one', 'example', 'would', 'suggest', 'would', 'suggest', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'valuable', 'scenes', 'show', 'frustration', 'family', 'member']",Promise

I could clearly identify with James Garner's character who &#34;didn't have a clue&#34; how to care for his incapacitated brother, and I &#34;went through all the motions&#34; with him as he tried to cope.  And the special feature dealing with how this movie was made was totally fascinating; the script was written around actual interviews with patients in a psychiatric hospital and was riveting, to say the least.  I now have a much deeper understanding of this mental condition and it has helped me as I cope with the family-care situation I am in.  This movie has become part of my permanent collection and I look forward to watching it many times in the future.  The acting is superb and the only downside for me is that the production runs only 98 minutes.  I would love to have seen it continue for another hour!",5,A Magnificent Movie,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,900,"['bought', 'movie', 'have', 'loved', 'one', 'symptoms', 'schizophrenia', 'could', 'clearly', 'identify', 'James', 'Garner', 'character', 'who', '34', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', '34', 'how', 'care', 'incapacitated', 'brother', '34', 'went', 'motions', '34', 'tried', 'cope', 'special', 'feature', 'dealing', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'totally', 'fascinating', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'actual', 'interviews', 'patients', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'was', 'riveting', 'say', 'least', 'now', 'have', 'much', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'mental', 'condition', 'helped', 'cope', 'family-care', 'situation', 'am', 'movie', 'become', 'part', 'permanent', 'collection', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'many', 'times', 'future', 'acting', 'superb', 'only', 'downside', 'production', 'only', '98', 'minutes', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'continue', 'hour']",Promise
