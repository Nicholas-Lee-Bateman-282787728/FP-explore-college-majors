I love his twisted, neurotic characters and brilliant physical comedy, but some people find it too lowbrow.  That's fine.This film is excellent in parts.  It does drag in some, but the funny parts more than overcome that.  All too often, sensitive men who are tidy and can cook are pegged as homosexual, and it's interesting to see someone in that situation who doesn't recoil in horror due to his homophobia.  Perry's character was not homophobic at all...he just simply was not gay.In a nutshell, the plot is this:  Perry and his business partner pitch an architectural project to a wealthy businessman.  The businessman's secretary thinks Perry and his business partner are gay and this is where the rubber meets the road.  The businessman asks Perry to spy on his mistress and predictably, Perry falls in love with her.  Both Campbell and Perry played the underlying frustration angle well, and the film builds to a satisfying, if predictable, climax.

119003,A1NRGN06OPD3O,0790748754,"Babushka ""pd69bq""","[0, 0]","First and foremost, I don't really care what I have been hearing from the  tabloids about Matthew Perry and Neve Campbell.  And when I heard this  movie is out, I was intrigued.  And when I've seen it, they were  sensational as they were paired up for the first time in this savvy  romantic comedy masterpiece. I picked this movie from Amazon the moment  Perry and Campbell were featured with Dylan McDermott (The Practice) in the  title cover of the DVD. The story is very original of its kind since  &quot;The Object of my Affection&quot; with Paul Rudd &amp; Jennifer  Aniston.  In &quot;Object of my Affection&quot;, a straight female falls in  love with an openly gay guy and were not meant for each other romantically.  While in Three to Tango, we see quite the opposite -- a straight guy, who  is accused and misunderstood of being gay, falls in love with a straight  gal, who thought that he is gay and at the end, were meant for each other.  As intrigue comes to embrace the viewers, the movie is beautifully directed  and well portrayed.  The movie kicks off with two architectural partners,  Oscar Novak and Peter Steinberg played by Perry and co-star Oliver Platt  respectively, together pursuing a job opportunity with a Forbes' tycoon,  Charles Newman played by McDermott.  With  Newman's acknowledgment of their  gay status, Steinberg &amp; Novak was awarded its big break except for  Oscar Novak, who is being misunderstood of being gay, was given additional  duties to spy on the tycoon's mistress, Amy played by Campbell for a  suspected romantic relationship between her and  a hunk football player,  Kevin Cartwright played by Clyk Cozart.  Wait what you are about to hear  later when Kevin confesses his attraction to Oscar.  And wait to see when  Oscar was selected and honored as &quot;Gay Professional of the Year&quot;.  It's chaotic fun just like the good old days.  Towards the end, Oscar  confesses his true identity during his honorary speech and his love for  Amy.  The final act is a kissing scene between Oscar and Amy, which put the  viewers to draw their conclusions.  For the movie theme, it's love conquers  all.  But for desperate fans searching about the truth, I hope that Three  to Tango is not some desperate attempt into reversing what's been said on  the tabloids.  Actually, the movie is a hit when these two were paired up  for the first time. Adding to the praise is the superb musical score.  The  swing era of the 50s and 60s is well adapted to the atmosphere of humor  around this modern story.  So if you're expanding your gay library, or if  you're just starting to build one, or if you like Friends and Beverly Hills  90210, then you'll like this one.  After all, Perry &amp; Campbell are just  among the youngest &amp; cutest stars around.",5,Matthew Perry &amp; Neve Campbell - An Intriguing Pair,958953600,"05 22, 2000",2000,2792,"['First', 'foremost', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'hearing', 'tabloids', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'when', 'heard', 'movie', 'out', 'was', 'intrigued', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'were', 'sensational', 'were', 'paired', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'savvy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'masterpiece', 'picked', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'moment', 'Perry', 'Campbell', 'were', 'featured', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'Practice', 'title', 'cover', 'DVD', 'story', 'very', 'original', 'kind', 'quot', 'Object', 'Affection', 'quot', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'amp', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'quot', 'Object', 'Affection', 'quot', 'straight', 'female', 'love', 'openly', 'gay', 'guy', 'were', 'not', 'meant', 'other', 'romantically', 'Three', 'Tango', 'see', 'quite', 'opposite', 'straight', 'guy', 'who', 'accused', 'misunderstood', 'being', 'gay', 'love', 'straight', 'gal', 'who', 'thought', 'gay', 'end', 'were', 'meant', 'other', 'intrigue', 'embrace', 'viewers', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'well', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'off', 'two', 'architectural', 'partners', 'Oscar', 'Novak', 'Peter', 'Steinberg', 'played', 'Perry', 'co-star', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'respectively', 'together', 'pursuing', 'job', 'opportunity', 'Forbes', 'tycoon', 'Charles', 'Newman', 'played', 'McDermott', 'Newman', 'acknowledgment', 'gay', 'status', 'Steinberg', 'amp', 'Novak', 'was', 'awarded', 'big', 'break', 'Oscar', 'Novak', 'who', 'being', 'misunderstood', 'being', 'gay', 'was', 'given', 'additional', 'duties', 'spy', 'tycoon', 'mistress', 'Amy', 'played', 'Campbell', 'suspected', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'hunk', 'football', 'player', 'Kevin', 'Cartwright', 'played', 'Clyk', 'Cozart', 'Wait', 'what', 'are', 'hear', 'later', 'when', 'Kevin', 'attraction', 'Oscar', 'wait', 'see', 'when', 'Oscar', 'was', 'selected', 'honored', 'quot', 'Gay', 'Professional', 'Year', 'quot', 'chaotic', 'fun', 'just', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'end', 'Oscar', 'true', 'identity', 'honorary', 'speech', 'love', 'Amy', 'final', 'act', 'kissing', 'scene', 'Oscar', 'Amy', 'put', 'viewers', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'movie', 'theme', 'love', 'conquers', 'desperate', 'fans', 'searching', 'truth', 'hope', 'Three', 'Tango', 'not', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'reversing', 'what', 'been', 'said', 'tabloids', 'Actually', 'movie', 'hit', 'when', 'two', 'were', 'paired', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'Adding', 'praise', 'superb', 'musical', 'score', 'swing', 'era', '50s', '60s', 'well', 'adapted', 'atmosphere', 'humor', 'modern', 'story', 'So', ""'re"", 'expanding', 'gay', 'library', ""'re"", 'just', 'starting', 'build', 'one', 'like', 'Friends', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one', 'Perry', 'amp', 'Campbell', 'are', 'just', 'youngest', 'amp', 'cutest', 'stars']",N/A

The charade of Perry pretending to be gay to win a construction contract provides many humorous situations and I  kept wanting Neve Cambell to find out the truth.  Perry is great in the  movie and combined with Cambell they make a great pair.  McDermott is kind  of wasted in his roll.  He is there just to set up Perry and Cambell.The  gay theme of this movie might be objectionable to some people.

119008,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0790748754,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","In Three to Tango Oscar Novak (Matthew Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) are architects who are vying for a $90 million dollar project. Steinberg is a friend of Dorothy, but Oscar isn't. He is just high strung and prone to making withering or self deprecating comments to mask his nervousness. Kind of like Chandler Bing. Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott) is the tycoon who will decide who gets to do the project. He thinks that Oscar is light in the loafers (NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT!) and recruits him to watch his mistress Amy (Neve Campbell) at her art opening, since he has to accompany his wife to a charity function. Oscar and Amy really hit it off, though their night together is a disaster:----------Peter Steinberg: What happened? Oscy... Oscy... it's six in the morning.Oscar Novak: It was awful, okay? As soon as we left the gallery, our cab caught on fire. THEN, she elbowed me in the face. THEN, we both threw up. THEN, she slammed a car handle into my balls, okay? The entire night was a total disaster.Peter Steinberg: You're in love with her.Oscar Novak: Pretty much.===========Actually, the worse the date is, the more Oscar gets to show off his shtick. He is in his element; the catastrophic date is his m&eacute;tier. His forte is self deprecating humor and withering remarks; the fact that Amy ""gets"" him--that they can laugh about things, no matter how bad things get--really draws them together.Oscar and Peter really want the project, so Oscar plays along, though he is falling for Amy. Charles reveals Oscar's orientation (though he  is 100% wrong) and Amy is disappointed, but then she lets her defenses down and they become very good friends. She asks for his advice on interior decorating, shoes, and relationships. When Amy loses her lease she moves in with him. Zany antics ensue.Three to Tango is actually a pretty good romantic comedy with a twist. The opening sequence is really pretty wild, with some crazy swing music over some blue prints and other architectural diagrams. Wow, either this movie is going to be about dancing for architecture, or it is going to be about a MMF love triangle involving Perry, Campbell, and McDermott. Sadly, it is the latter, but wait--it's really funny.The Chandler Bing persona is a humorous persona indeed--a Persona Grata, if you will; this sort of comedy suits Perry like Armani. Matt was also a hoot in Fools Rush In with the sizzling Salma Hayek. He should do a guest appearance on Cougar Town--he could reunite with an old 'friend'. Neve Campbell is cute, sexy, and a great foil for Perry. McDermott completes the triangle. He makes a good whacky tycoon. Check him out in Party Monster with his eyepatch, Macauly Caulkin, and Seth Green. Platt flings some good zingers, and he makes the most of them. Scrubs' Dr Perry Cox (John C. McGinley) and Bob Balaban, who played network chief Russell Dalrymple on Seinfeld, are unrivaled as the rival architectural firm partners.With the jazzy, swinging opening sequence, I was hoping it would be more of a musical. But the fellows in Steinberg's circle were more into dinner parties and shopping for small dogs. The soundtrack featured tantalizing appetizers by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Squirrel Nut Zippers, and Cherry Poppin' Daddies, but it lacked an all out Jump,  Jive, and Wail moment with full-on choreography. Then, just as I was giving up hope, there was a great musical interlude by The Atomic Fireballs doing a super fantastic 'Swing Sweet Pussycat' as the credits rolled.Bottom Line is that Three to Tango was a pretty funny rom com. Though an MFF triangle trumps an MMF triangle, this one managed to redeem itself through, stealth, cunning, a little bluffing, and pushing the envelope without crossing the line. Just as a straight flush beats a full house, Three to Tango beat Three of Hearts (1993, William Baldwin, Kelly Lynch, & Sherilyn Fenn), and all but the best episodes of Three's Company, even though they both had the triangle advantage.17 Again(2009) Matthew Perry was Mike O'Donnell (Adult)The Company(2003) Neve Campbell was Loretta 'Ry' RyanParty Monster(2003) Dylan McDermott was Peter

Through a huge misunderstanding Perry is believed to be gay,  and the hilarity ensues. Dylan McDermott is delightfully nasty as the  high-powered businessman unafraid to throw his weight around to get what he  wants. No longer seen as a threat, he convinces Perry to play watchdog over  his mistress (Neve Campbell) for fear that she fall into the arms of  another man. Perry, of course falls head over heels, and is now powerless  to do anything about it for fear of losing his job. The fact that everyone  now assumes that Perry is gay lends itself to some very funny scenes, but  also some very over the top, unbelievable situations.Matthew Perry is  charming as usual, and delivers each line with his signature comedic  timing. Neve Campbell is perfect as the flighty, artistic love interest and  the object of two men's affections. Oliver Platt is very good as the  straight man to Perry's antics, but delivers his share of funny moments as  well. I can't help but feel that some critics refuse to take Perry's  ability to act outside of the ""Friends"" confines seriously. I think that he  has a great deal of talent, a natural feel for comedy, and is obviously the  best of the ""Friends"" bunch.

Why do I like this movie so much?  It could be the cast, bringing in the talents of Matthew Perry, Neve Cambell, Oliver Platt, and others you may recognize.  Perry and Platt play (three times fast?) architects who own a small business.  When a business man (Dylan McDermott)hired them for a special gig, he hears rumors that Perry is gay, when it is actually Platt who leans that way.  McDermott, suspecting his girlfriend (Cambell) might be cheating on him (ironic, since it is he himself who is cheating), enlists Perry to spy on her.  To make a long story short (too late) Perry falls head over heals for Cambell, while she (and the rest of the country, due to a newspaper article) believe he is gay.

119013,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0790748754,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 5]","This is a forgettable film that masquerades as a romantic comedy when it is really a satire on homophobia.  Actually, the storyline is quite clever and there are a number of good sight gags, but the dialogue is uniformly  dreadful and lowbrow.  The writing is hack and sitcomesque which might  explain why they loaded this cast with TV actors.We are presented with  two architects who are vying for a contract that can revitalize their  ailing business with a roguish developer named Charles Newman (Dylan  McDermot).  Charles is married and having an affair with Amy (Neve  Campbell), but he is jealous and wants to keep tabs on her.  Thinking Oscar  (Matthew Perry) is gay and no threat, he asks him to spy on her, implying  that it might help him to get the contract.  The rest is pretty  predictable.  They fall in love, but she thinks he's gay so there is no  hope.  Eventually love prevails (no spoiler here, no-one on the planet  could watch this movie and think they wouldn't get together), but not  before numerous mistaken gender orientation gags run their course.This  film was obviously presented from a gay perspective as a satire on  homophobia.  All the gay characters are portrayed as respectable, admirable  and wise, while all the straight men are portrayed as rogues, misfits and  buffoons.  You see skit after skit where homophobia is lampooned.  Women  can't confide in a man unless they think he's gay, because straight men are  just too insensitive to understand.  Gays in the closet are bashed repeated  with snide remarks.  This probably explains why this film was more well  received by women than men, since much the comedy really mocked straight  men and their fear of homosexuality.Matthew Perry has made a career out  of playing hapless losers with the appeal being that it's funny to see  someone who is even more woefully inept than the average viewer.  While I  don't find this particularly funny, I will give him his due and say that he  is a master of the art.  He gets high marks for being able to  simultaneously evoke laughter and sympathy over his plight.  Also, I found  his chemistry good with Campbell, and his longing for her was played with a  good deal of sincerity and sensitivity.Neve Campbell is really just  window dressing here.  Her role is to smile, look cute and sexy and play  the love interest.  This is not a real stretch for her since she can  essentially do all those things by just standing there.Dylan McDermot  was pretty dreadful as the scoundrel.  In his defense, he didn't have much  to work with since the way his part was written he was portraying more of a  caricature than a character.  It is difficult for an actor to slip into the  skin of an absurdity and know exactly how to play it.The best acting in  the film came from Oliver Platt, who played Oscar Novak's business partner.  He was funny and played an excellent straight man to Perry's clown.  Platt  is a veteran and a professional and always brings substance to his  supporting roles.This film has its moments but not enough of them.  It  is effective social satire and it is mildly successful as a romantic  comedy, but it bogs down frequently with too many variations on the same  gay theme.  Though funny in parts, it is generally just silliness.  I rated  it a 5/10.",2,Forgettable Romantic Comedy,955843200,"04 16, 2000",2000,3299,"['forgettable', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'when', 'really', 'satire', 'homophobia', 'Actually', 'storyline', 'quite', 'clever', 'are', 'number', 'good', 'sight', 'gags', 'dialogue', 'uniformly', 'dreadful', 'lowbrow', 'writing', 'hack', 'sitcomesque', 'might', 'explain', 'why', 'loaded', 'cast', 'TV', 'actors.We', 'are', 'presented', 'two', 'architects', 'who', 'are', 'vying', 'contract', 'can', 'revitalize', 'ailing', 'business', 'roguish', 'developer', 'named', 'Charles', 'Newman', 'Dylan', 'McDermot', 'Charles', 'married', 'having', 'affair', 'Amy', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'jealous', 'keep', 'tabs', 'Thinking', 'Oscar', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'gay', 'threat', 'spy', 'implying', 'might', 'help', 'get', 'contract', 'rest', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'fall', 'love', 'gay', 'so', 'hope', 'Eventually', 'love', 'prevails', 'spoiler', 'here', 'no-one', 'planet', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'together', 'not', 'before', 'numerous', 'mistaken', 'gender', 'orientation', 'gags', 'run', 'course.This', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'presented', 'gay', 'perspective', 'satire', 'homophobia', 'gay', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'respectable', 'admirable', 'wise', 'straight', 'men', 'are', 'portrayed', 'rogues', 'misfits', 'buffoons', 'see', 'skit', 'skit', 'where', 'homophobia', 'lampooned', 'Women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'confide', 'man', 'think', 'gay', 'straight', 'men', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'insensitive', 'understand', 'Gays', 'closet', 'are', 'bashed', 'repeated', 'snide', 'remarks', 'probably', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'well', 'received', 'women', 'men', 'much', 'comedy', 'really', 'mocked', 'straight', 'men', 'fear', 'homosexuality.Matthew', 'Perry', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'hapless', 'losers', 'appeal', 'being', 'funny', 'see', 'someone', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'woefully', 'inept', 'average', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'particularly', 'funny', 'will', 'give', 'due', 'say', 'master', 'art', 'high', 'marks', 'being', 'able', 'simultaneously', 'evoke', 'laughter', 'sympathy', 'plight', 'Also', 'found', 'chemistry', 'good', 'Campbell', 'longing', 'was', 'played', 'good', 'deal', 'sincerity', 'sensitivity.Neve', 'Campbell', 'really', 'just', 'window', 'dressing', 'here', 'role', 'smile', 'look', 'cute', 'sexy', 'play', 'love', 'interest', 'not', 'real', 'stretch', 'can', 'essentially', 'do', 'things', 'just', 'standing', 'there.Dylan', 'McDermot', 'was', 'pretty', 'dreadful', 'scoundrel', 'defense', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'way', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'was', 'portraying', 'more', 'caricature', 'character', 'difficult', 'actor', 'slip', 'skin', 'absurdity', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'play', 'it.The', 'best', 'acting', 'film', 'came', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'who', 'played', 'Oscar', 'Novak', 'business', 'partner', 'was', 'funny', 'played', 'excellent', 'straight', 'man', 'Perry', 'clown', 'Platt', 'veteran', 'professional', 'always', 'brings', 'substance', 'supporting', 'roles.This', 'film', 'moments', 'not', 'enough', 'effective', 'social', 'satire', 'mildly', 'successful', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'bogs', 'down', 'frequently', 'too', 'many', 'variations', 'same', 'gay', 'theme', 'funny', 'parts', 'generally', 'just', 'silliness', 'rated', '5/10']",N/A
119014,A2HVL790PBWYTU,0790748754,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","I consider Three to Tango to be tied with Fools Rush In as the top two Matthew Perry vehicles in his body of work. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend either one. Like Fools Rush In, Three to Tango is a lighthearted, romantic romp, showcasing Perry at his ingratiating best.Quick premise: A chain of contrived circumstances lead wealthy businessman Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott) to believe that architect Oscar Novak (Matthew Perry) is gay. With the implied promise of a job, Charles convinces Oscar to escort and spy on his hot mistress Amy (Neve Campbell) and keep her away from possible rivals. So, of course, following the formula, Oscar falls in love with Amy, who, in turn, is crushing back on him, until she finds out he's gay. As the movie goes on, Oscar finds it more difficult and frustrating to keep his true feelings hidden from her. It doesn't help that she soon becomes his house guest and that his ""outing"" becomes media news fodder, shocking his friends and incensing his father. But what it ultimately boils down to for Oscar is that he must choose between his vocation and the woman he loves.There aren't really any major surprises here. This premise is certainly not original, going back as far as Three's Company in the '70s. Having said that, Three to Tango is still worth a look. The film boasts well-executed comedy sequences, a sweet romance, some fan-friendly acting, and great chemistry between Perry and Campbell. The humor in the film surfaces from several sources - from Perry and Platt's one liners, from Oscar's football-watching buddies (most notably Rick Gomez, the dimwit of the group), and from Oscar's sitcom-type situation itself. I disagree with  Mark Englehart's review in that I felt the gay issue was treated with a light touch and doesn't weigh down the plot at all.Perry's Oscar Novak doesn't stray too far from his Chandler Bing roots. In fact, other than the name, Oscar is exactly like Chandler, quirky mannerisms and all. But as long as Perry doesn't mine this character type too often, it's not a career ender (matter of fact, for a more serious Matthew Perry role, check out TNT's The Ron Clark Story when it comes out on dvd). And, as Oscar, Perry is consistently charming, witty, and endearing in his fumbling insecurities. My favorite line in the film is uttered by Perry, as he gazes at a portrait of a naked, hirsute heinie adorned with a Bosnian flag: ""I had no idea things were so hairy in Bosnia.""Lovely Neve Campbell is great here. To be honest, I've never seen her in any bad roles. Here, she presents Amy as independent and free-spirited, yet with a vulnerable side. Like most people, she just wants to be loved. Neve Campbell really needs to do more films. God, I love her smile.McDermott is competent as the doofus to root against, dastardly portraying the callous, self-involved, yoga-immersed Charles. Kelly Rowan, as Charles's perceptive wife, doesn't have a lot of screen time yet still makes her presence felt. Oliver Platt is terrific as Peter, Oscar's very funny, self-assured, gay business partner.The special features kinda suck. The double-sided disc presents a full screen version on the A side, and widescreen on the B. There's a theatrical trailer and some behind the scenes facts. And that's it.With Friends having been off the air for some years now, and with the resulting shift away of the spotlight from Matthew Perry, I don't know how many folks now remember this film. For those who haven't seen it and are wondering if it's worth renting or purchasing or even just watching on cable, the answer is a definite yes. Just don't watch it while scarfing a tuna melt.",4,"""You've made a big, gay bed, and you must now slumber gaily in it.""",1157673600,"09 8, 2006",2006,3644,"['consider', 'Three', 'Tango', 'be', 'tied', 'Fools', 'Rush', 'top', 'two', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'vehicles', 'body', 'work', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'one', 'Fools', 'Rush', 'Three', 'Tango', 'lighthearted', 'romantic', 'romp', 'showcasing', 'Perry', 'ingratiating', 'best.Quick', 'premise', 'chain', 'contrived', 'circumstances', 'lead', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'Charles', 'Newman', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'believe', 'architect', 'Oscar', 'Novak', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'gay', 'implied', 'promise', 'job', 'Charles', 'Oscar', 'escort', 'spy', 'hot', 'mistress', 'Amy', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'keep', 'away', 'possible', 'rivals', 'So', 'course', 'following', 'formula', 'Oscar', 'love', 'Amy', 'who', 'turn', 'crushing', 'back', 'gay', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'more', 'difficult', 'frustrating', 'keep', 'true', 'feelings', 'hidden', ""n't"", 'help', 'soon', 'becomes', 'house', 'guest', 'outing', 'media', 'news', 'fodder', 'shocking', 'friends', 'incensing', 'father', 'what', 'ultimately', 'down', 'Oscar', 'must', 'choose', 'vocation', 'woman', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'major', 'surprises', 'here', 'premise', 'certainly', 'not', 'original', 'going', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'Three', 'Company', ""'70s"", 'Having', 'said', 'Three', 'Tango', 'still', 'worth', 'look', 'film', 'well-executed', 'comedy', 'sequences', 'sweet', 'romance', 'fan-friendly', 'acting', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Perry', 'Campbell', 'humor', 'film', 'surfaces', 'several', 'sources', 'Perry', 'Platt', 'one', 'liners', 'Oscar', 'football-watching', 'buddies', 'most', 'notably', 'Rick', 'Gomez', 'dimwit', 'group', 'Oscar', 'sitcom-type', 'situation', 'disagree', 'Mark', 'Englehart', 'review', 'felt', 'gay', 'issue', 'was', 'treated', 'light', 'touch', ""n't"", 'weigh', 'down', 'plot', 'all.Perry', 'Oscar', 'Novak', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'Chandler', 'Bing', 'roots', 'fact', 'other', 'name', 'Oscar', 'exactly', 'like', 'Chandler', 'quirky', 'mannerisms', 'as', 'long', 'Perry', ""n't"", 'mine', 'character', 'type', 'too', 'often', 'not', 'career', 'ender', 'matter', 'fact', 'more', 'serious', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'role', 'check', 'out', 'TNT', 'Ron', 'Clark', 'Story', 'when', 'out', 'dvd', 'Oscar', 'Perry', 'consistently', 'charming', 'witty', 'endearing', 'fumbling', 'insecurities', 'favorite', 'line', 'film', 'uttered', 'Perry', 'portrait', 'naked', 'hirsute', 'heinie', 'adorned', 'Bosnian', 'flag', 'had', 'idea', 'things', 'were', 'so', 'hairy', 'Bosnia', 'Lovely', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'great', 'here', 'be', 'honest', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'bad', 'roles', 'Here', 'independent', 'free-spirited', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'most', 'people', 'just', 'be', 'loved', 'Neve', 'Campbell', 'really', 'do', 'more', 'films', 'God', 'love', 'smile.McDermott', 'competent', 'doofus', 'root', 'dastardly', 'portraying', 'callous', 'self-involved', 'yoga-immersed', 'Charles', 'Kelly', 'Rowan', 'Charles', 'perceptive', 'wife', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'yet', 'still', 'presence', 'felt', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'terrific', 'Peter', 'Oscar', 'very', 'funny', 'self-assured', 'gay', 'business', 'partner.The', 'special', 'features', 'kinda', 'suck', 'double-sided', 'disc', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'A', 'side', 'widescreen', 'B', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'scenes', 'facts', 'it.With', 'Friends', 'having', 'been', 'air', 'years', 'now', 'resulting', 'shift', 'away', 'spotlight', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'folks', 'now', 'remember', 'film', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'are', 'wondering', 'worth', 'renting', 'purchasing', 'even', 'just', 'watching', 'cable', 'answer', 'definite', 'yes', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'scarfing', 'tuna', 'melt']",N/A

Very few actors get to me like he does when he's portraying hurt and inner struggle - really pulls on the heartstrings.  Fantastic acting.Neve Campbell as Amy was lively and fun and it's easy to see why Oscar would fall for her.The moment when Amy is about to kiss Oscar and then realises what she's doing and their following fight over Newman is one of the best in the film for both actors.You can really see the turmoil they're both having - she because she's falling for what she thinks is a 'gay' guy and he because  he hates seeing her with Newman but can't tell her of his true feelings due to his loyalty to his friend, Steinberg who will go bankrupt if they lose the job.All in all a warm and touching film that is extremely funny in places.

The only problem with this, is that everyone thinks Oscar (Matthew Perry) is gay. Which he's not. Now, I've seen enough Friends (and have 5 seasons on DVD) to know that this story has been done to death on Friends. And here we go with it again! Everyone with Chandler thought he was gay - especially when he had that 'evil' goatee thing going on.This movie reminded me very much of Object Of My Affection (starring Jennifer Aniston), as it's the same storyline, except from a (pregnant) girl's point of view, fancying a gay guy. This time it's Matthew Perry, who has to almost pretend he's gay, so his boss won't suspect him. His boss (played by Dylan McDermott) thinks Oscar is 'safe' because he's gay - when he's really not. (Also has similarities to Chasing Amy, but without the sarcastic humour of Kevin Smith at the helm.)Why Matthew Perry? He basically plays Chandler all over again, and he's very obviously going to be stereotyped all over again. Unless he does a really outrageous movie. And then everyone will say he was better as Chandler. That's the problem. With Friends now over, the six of them will trying to make the transition fully into movies, instead of doing the odd film here and there. And so far, in my opinion, only Jennifer Aniston has had some reasonable success in movies. The only other has been Courtney Cox with the Scream movies. We'll not mention Matt Le Blanc & Ross Schwimmer in this section, as their tries have been diabolical.This film was reasonably good, and it was enjoyable to watch. Neve Campbell is fantastic, and what the guys in the film say is true - you would have to be gay not to fall in love with her. I just love the way when she's about to cry, her eyes fill up, and they always look very strange. No other actor can pull this off.My favourite scene was when Oscar was on the bus, and it just had come out (in the newspapers!) that he was gay. And he was getting eyed up, especially by this guy. He can't put his back to him, cos the guy stares at his backside, and if he turns round - well, I won't say where his eyes would be! And the joint throwing up scene is funny, as is all the scenes where Oscar & Amy are getting to know each other.There is nothing in the way of extras on this DVD, only a trailer. Whoopee!If you enjoyed Object Of My Affection, and want a movie without Paul Rudd, I would go for this one. Plus, Oliver Platt (apparently, super gay!) is fantastic, although he doesn't act that over the top gay most of the time.

119030,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0790748754,Reviewer,"[0, 2]","Director Damon Santostefano delivers a mildly amusing, but predictable one-joke comedy with ""Three To Tango,"" starring Neve Campbell, Matthew Perry and Dylan McDermott.  Struggling architects Oscar Novak (Perry) and  Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) have a shot at a ninety million dollar  renovation job, a project to be funded by tycoon businessman Charles Newman  (McDermott).  Circumstances lead Newman to believe that Oscar in gay, which  makes him the perfect choice for another job Newman has in mind.  He has a  mistress, Amy (Campbell), a free-spirited artist, and the jealous Newman  needs someone to keep an eye on her during the opening of an exhibition of  her work, since he will be unable to attend.  Oscar is reluctant at first  (and he doesn't have any idea that Newman thinks he's gay), but it may help  them land the renovation job, so he agrees.  He has no way of foreseeing,  of course, that he will end up falling in love with Amy.  And, complicating  matters even more, for Oscar, is the fact that Amy has been told that he is  gay.  How to resolve it all?  Oscar needs the job, but he wants to be with  the woman he loves; and meanwhile, everybody thinks he's gay.  All of  which wears thin, and fairly rapidly.  The screenplay is neither clever nor  imaginative, and Santostefano has done even less with the material at hand,  resorting to slapstick for the laughs (and there are a few).  Perry brings  an engaging presence to the screen, and he does know how to play comedy;  his timing is good, and the best scenes in the movie are the ones he shares  with Platt.  Campbell, on the other hand, leaves something to be desired  with her Amy; managing little more than the occasional theatrical smile  (squint and show some teeth), she comes across as shallow and pretentious.  Amy (as she plays her) simply doesn't warrant the conflict called for by  the story.  And Dylan McDermott is too good an actor for this one-note role  he's been handed here, though he does well enough with what he's been  given.  The most notable performance is courtesy of Platt, whose character,  in fact, is gay, but thought by everyone to be straight; and he plays it  for all it's worth.

119033,A11JU33HMT5XPU,0790748754,"S. Lawrenz ""Lendorien""","[1, 2]","Synopsis:Oscar Novak (Matthew Perry) is an up and coming architect, bidding with his partner (Oliver Platt) for a project to renovate a classic Chicago landmark.  Business Tycoon Charles Newmann (Dylan McDermott), the man seeking the bids, mistakenly comes to believe that Oscar is gay and asks him to babysit his mistress (Neve Campbell) for him.  With his business on the line, he agrees to do it, but even in agreeing, he must now pretend to prefer a sexual preference that he does not. Things go from bad to worse when he falls for the tycoon's Mistress.About the Movie:This is not a film for social conservatives.  With homosexuality having become one of the major  hot topics in America, this film proves how a movie can have as much a social agenda as a church can..One interesting thing to point out about this film is how it uses Mathew Perry's character Oscar Novak to mirror the plight of closeted homosexuals.  The Amazon Editorial Review (by Mark Engleheart) completely missed the point of the movie in saying that Novak's supposed gayness is treated simply as ""an oppressive burden.""Social standing, job security and even friendships hang in the balance because of Novak's supposed sexual orientation.  The film's point is that this is a burden that many homosexuals feel they have to deal with. In a sense Novak is now forced to deal with the same issues that gays deal with by having to ""be in the closet"" about being straight.  If anything, the movie advocates openness and tolerance, something Novak learns about first hand. It's the classic, ""walking in another man's shoes"" satire.Ultimately, Three to Tango is a film that pretends to be a romantic comedy but is really a obvious endeavor to promote an image of homosexuality as ""normal"" through genuinely humorous satire. In an era of political correctness, this is the ultimate film for it.  It presents a perfect politically correct image of homosexuality, even going so far as to make it seem like the ideal to strive for. Homosexuals are the good guys, sensitive, understanding, and open, while straight men are losers, who cheat on their wives and are emotionally detached and insensitive.Three to Tango does its job very well, playing on the audience's emotional output, and challenging their conventions with uneasy situations (as many movies do) to get the audience to agree with the premise.Matthew Perry's character gets into his situation and gains his love interest precisely because he fits the stereotypical homosexual image (the one of the sensitive well-dressed male without the lisp and limp wrist). The movie seems to say that the homosexual image is the one to strive for, because Perry, a straight man fits it so perfectly and finds happiness with a beautiful woman in the end as a result.Meanwhile, the quasi bad guy, Dylan McDermott's character, Charles Newmann, is a caricature of a straight man; insensitive, an adulterer, a manly man, who's possessive, jealous, selfish and vindictive.  He's over the top and unlikable, precisely because he was written to be that way.  McDermott plays the role to the T, which provides a perfect counterpoint to the film's overall portrayal of the straight/gay issue.The end statement is that sexual orientation should not be the issue, it should be your feelings and who you are.In all honesty, it's hard not to like this film at least on some level, even if you don't agree with the message that it is preaching.  Matthew Perry is an expert at filling out the role of a bewildered man thrown into unexpected and peculiar situations with both humor and sensitivity.  He's a wonderful and charming comic actor, and it shows.  Neve Campbell is cute as his co-star, and there are a lot of comic moments that are laugh out loud funny.Of course, a lot of the humor comes directly from Oscar being put in the position of a straight man dealing with being thought of as gay, with some of the humor being overtly sexual in nature. People who disagree with the homosexual lifestyle will understandably dislike this film, because it is openly pro-gay and presents the issue in an extremely one-sided manner.About the DVD:Three to Tango comes in a cardboard snap case on a double-sided DVD with both fullscreen and Widescreen versions of the film in Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.  The image and sound are pretty good for a budget DVD, with only a little film grain or artifacts.  The movie is translated into French and has English and French subtitles. One wonders when the big studios will figure out that Spanish is the second most commonly spoken language on the North American continent.As far as special features, this one has what appears to be something that is becoming standard on Warner Brothers budget DVD releases.  They include the theatrical trailer for the film and a series of textual production notes that provide background on the movie.  They're interesting to read, but not much as far as special features go. This release even skimps on the actor bios that usually provided with most budget releases.Bottom Line:A comedic film with a clear social message to provide to its audience that will undoubtedly turn away some because of it. A decent (depending on social views) movie on a standard DVD release.  3 stars.",3,Social satire about homosexuality,1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,5250,"['Synopsis', 'Oscar', 'Novak', 'Matthew',

119036,A243HY69GIAHFI,0790748754,tropic_of_criticism,"[2, 3]","THREE TO TANGO won't leave most people unsatisfied.  It's pleasant enough.  The acting evokes the emotions the script called for.  Campbell and Perry are utterly charming together, and you easily find yourself wanting to see them in every scene.  The absolute worst that can be said about the leads' acting, in fact, is that at times Perry seems to be doing an imitation of himself on FRIENDS.  But even that has its charms (if you like FRIENDS).No, my problem with this movie is exactly what the Amazon editorial review points out: it's obviously TOOTSIE redone.  But, comically, there's less to a man being mistaken for a homosexual than a man being mistaken for a woman.  With TOOTSIE, a lot of the humor came from the transformation of Michael Dorsey into Dorothy Michaels.  There was a sense of danger at times that his cover might be blown. Here, there's no transformation of any kind, no danger that Perry's worlds might collide. There's simply the irrefutable statement, ""I'm gay.""  The only injury that can come to Perry's lie is if he inflicts it himself.  And this is basically what the movie is about: Perry's search for the moment when he can come out of the closet and thereby get the girl.Amazon's editorial writer found this ""borderline offensive"", and here I have to part company with him.  I'm not sure why Perry's view of his ""homosexuality"" as a burden would be ""offensive"".  Of course he's taxed by it: it's a lie, and it's preventing him from being with the one he loves.  I think the script makes fairly clear that homosexuality itself isn't some onerous duty.No, the real weight THREE TO TANGO has to carry is, like any remake, its similarity to the original.  There, it fails to compare to TOOTSIE by almost every standard of measurement.  It's nowhere near as funny or poignant as its predecessor.  Its supporting cast collapses into mere caricature by the end.  The musical score leaves a comparative lot to be desired.  And the finale itself is very much more pat and expected than TOOTSIE's.To put it more succinctly:  if you've never seen TOOTSIE you'll probably enjoy this movie a lot more than if you have.[DVD notes: Save yourself some money and get it on VHS; there's nothing to this DVD worth getting.]",2,"Charming, but get TOOTSIE instead",974851200,"11 22, 2000",2000,2237,"['THREE', 'TO', 'TANGO', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'most', 'people', 'unsatisfied', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'acting', 'emotions', 'script', 'called', 'Campbell', 'Perry', 'are', 'utterly', 'charming', 'together', 'easily', 'find', 'wanting', 'see', 'scene', 'absolute', 'worst', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'leads', 'acting', 'fact', 'times', 'Perry', 'be', 'doing', 'imitation', 'FRIENDS', 'even', 'charms', 'like', 'FRIENDS', '.No', 'problem', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'Amazon', 'editorial', 'review', 'points', 'out', 'obviously', 'TOOTSIE', 'redone', 'comically', 'less', 'man', 'being', 'mistaken', 'homosexual', 'man', 'being', 'mistaken', 'woman', 'TOOTSIE', 'lot', 'humor', 'came', 'transformation', 'Michael', 'Dorsey', 'Dorothy', 'Michaels', 'was', 'sense', 'danger', 'times', 'cover', 'might', 'be', 'blown', 'Here', 'transformation', 'kind', 'danger', 'Perry', 'worlds', 'might', 'collide', 'simply', 'irrefutable', 'statement', ""'m"", 'gay', 'only', 'injury', 'can', 'come', 'Perry', 'lie', 'basically', 'what', 'movie', 'Perry', 'search', 'moment', 'when', 'can', 'come', 'closet', 'thereby', 'get', 'girl.Amazon', 'editorial', 'writer', 'found', 'borderline', 'offensive', 'here', 'have', 'part', 'company', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Perry', 'view', 'homosexuality', 'burden', 'would', 'be', 'offensive', 'course', 'taxed', 'lie', 'preventing', 'being', 'one', 'think', 'script', 'fairly', 'clear', 'homosexuality', ""n't"", 'onerous', 'duty.No', 'real', 'weight', 'THREE', 'TO', 'TANGO', 'carry', 'remake', 'similarity', 'original', 'compare', 'TOOTSIE', 'almost', 'standard', 'measurement', 'nowhere', 'near', 'funny', 'poignant', 'predecessor', 'supporting', 'cast', 'collapses', 'mere', 'caricature', 'end', 'musical', 'score', 'comparative', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'finale', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'pat', 'expected', ""TOOTSIE's.To"", 'put', 'more', 'succinctly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'TOOTSIE', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'have', '[', 'DVD', 'notes', 'Save', 'money', 'get', 'VHS', 'nothing', 'DVD', 'getting', ']']",N/A
