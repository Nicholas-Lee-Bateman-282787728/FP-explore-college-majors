I hadn't seen acting this so unbelievably bad from a cast that contained two major stars, and I don't even think that Robin Wright Penn has been so comparatively bad as other films I've seen involving a female lead with the notable exceptions of Julianne Moore, Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, etc. On the whole, the entirety of She's So Ugly cast has been straight F turkey. It was hard to sit through the movie because I was literally watching a train wreck, and it was also difficult to keep my eyes on the screen. That was so painfully bad that I had to keep noticing that nasty, hideous bump on Harry Dean Stanton's forehead. He and Debi Mazar have to consider retirement from acting because they plain stunk. As for Sean Penn, can there be the most overrated actor alive? She's So Ugly marked the umpteenth time that he broke down crying and feeling sorry for himself in a film. How many times had this been done before? And how many times must this phoniness continue? I am tired of him. Then, there is John Travolta; at the point of him showing up, I had hoped that he would alleviate the pain of the film for me. But nope, he started to stunk it up with the obnoxiousness of his behavior. Speaking of illegal behavior, I couldn't believe that Robin Wright Penn's character was poisoning her fetus with alcohol, smoking, and assumed drug use. Then, I get insulted in the meanwhile that the daughter turned out to be fine. Uh uh...never happens in real life. That was supposed to be a child with a full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Now, honestly...why would anyone, especially somebody with money, to pick up a woman from the gutters who is all beaten up, drugged up, and totally out of it in her mind? That never happens either. Of Sean Penn's character, after ten years in the institution, that's how much he changed? Yeah right...we need more realism here. Some critics have said that this movie is funny. Hm, I don't see it. Finally, I decided that I've had enough and declared She's So Ugly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Without a question, She's So Ugly is beyond bad.",1,Awful.,1291334400,"12 3, 2010",2010,2294,"['Viewed', '12/10Rate', '112/10', 'Noticing', 'amount', 'secondhand', 'smoke', 'going', 'So', 'Ugly', 'safe', 'surmise', 'everybody', 'involved', 'had', 'lost', 'ten', 'years', 'lives', 'doing', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'acting', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'bad', 'cast', 'contained', 'two', 'major', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'been', 'so', 'comparatively', 'bad', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'involving', 'female', 'lead', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'etc', 'whole', 'entirety', 'So', 'Ugly', 'cast', 'been', 'straight', 'F', 'turkey', 'was', 'hard', 'sit', 'movie', 'was', 'literally', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'was', 'also', 'difficult', 'keep', 'eyes', 'screen', 'was', 'so', 'painfully', 'bad', 'had', 'keep', 'noticing', 'nasty', 'hideous', 'bump', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'forehead', 'Debi', 'Mazar', 'have', 'consider', 'retirement', 'acting', 'plain', 'stunk', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'can', 'there', 'be', 'most', 'overrated', 'actor', 'alive', 'So', 'Ugly', 'marked', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'broke', 'down', 'crying', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'film', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'must', 'phoniness', 'continue', 'am', 'tired', 'Then', 'John', 'Travolta', 'point', 'showing', 'up', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'alleviate', 'pain', 'film', 'nope', 'started', 'stunk', 'up', 'obnoxiousness', 'behavior', 'Speaking', 'illegal', 'behavior', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'character', 'was', 'poisoning', 'fetus', 'alcohol', 'smoking', 'assumed', 'drug', 'use', 'Then', 'get', 'insulted', 'meanwhile', 'daughter', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'fine', 'Uh', 'uh', 'never', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'child', 'full-blown', 'Fetal', 'Alcohol', 'Syndrome', 'FAS', 'Now', 'honestly', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'especially', 'somebody', 'money', 'pick', 'up', 'woman', 'gutters', 'who', 'beaten', 'up', 'drugged', 'up', 'totally', 'mind', 'never', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'character', 'ten', 'years', 'institution', 'how', 'much', 'changed', 'Yeah', 'right', 'need', 'more', 'realism', 'here', 'critics', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'funny', 'Hm', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Finally', 'decided', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'declared', 'So', 'Ugly', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'question', 'So', 'Ugly', 'bad']",She's So Lovely VHS

Can't say that I blame him. I'm bothered by the same things when the tables are turned.  But yet and still, this is just a good film. It is bizarre and rather unexpected, but for some odd reason, that didn't seem to bother me a bit.  Robin Wright-Penn is an EXCELLENT actress, and I've never seen her acting as strong as it is in this film.  She holds it down, and I mean HOLDS IT DOWN! Sean Penn is a very under-rated actor (unfortunately), but in my opinion, he's one of the best. In this movie, however, it's his wife, Robin, who shines. This is definitely a soul-mate love kind of movie, with interesting twists and turns.  Not everyone's gonna like it, though, so ladies, this is NOT a movie you want to watch with your man...trust me on this!

They exist in a psychotic little paradise that is buoyed by Eddie's frenetic energy and drive to please Maureen--when he is around, anyway.  He is prone to disappear for days at a time.  This part of the film is a gritty, fascinating character study.Eddie goes to jail for ten years.  During that time, Maureen marries Joey (John Travolta), and they start a family.  Eddie is released from jail and he wants Maureen back, which sets the stage for the second half of the film.  Here it goes astray.  It was difficult for me to understand the choices that Maureen makes at the end of this film, even given the fact that she is crazy.  Such craziness seems to be at odds with the suburban lifestyle that she has maintained with apparent success for a decade.

435868,A3N28SBSNVUR9X,6304798458,David Grim,"[15, 17]","If you read the various reviews of this movie, you will find an amazing array of responses to it. I think this is largely a function of the horrid marketing of this movie. When my friend recmmended that I watch it, I did a once-over of its packaging and decided I wasn't interested. He insisted, and so I reluctantly agreed to watch it. Despite it's packaging, this is not a sentimental romantic comedy in the ""Pretty Woman"" or ""Look Who's Talking"" vein. If this is the sort of movie you like, you should move on and not waste your time with this.The movie is divided into two parts. The first focuses on the troubled relationship of derelict couple Eddie and Moe (played by real-life spouses Sean and Robin Wright Penn). Penn's character is dissolute, and puts Moe in the bad position of being vulnerable to the sleazy advances of a neighbor (played well by The Sopranos' James Gandolfini). When Eddie finds out what happens as a result, he becomes steadily unhinged. His performance in a barroom scene is one of the most convincing portrayals of drunken progressive madness I have seen on film.The second part of the film benefits mainly from the introduction of John Travolta in a role that mercifully pulls back from stretching his limited acting range. This IS the Travolta we guiltily derived pleasure from before he decided he was a mega-action flick star. What follows is a somewhat unlikely but morally and emotionally challenged dilemma for Moe (Robin Penn Wright). While viewers who tend to view life in rather black-and-white terms will be horrified by this portion of the movie, open-minded viewers will have the opportunity to analyze the various components of the ensuing relationships and positions of the players. It is troublesome and problematic and so avoids easy answers or judgements. What's great about the film, unlike other indie films that revel in their dispassion, is that it is not afraid to allow you to feel for these characters deeply, despite their many flaws. The performances are great, and the movie stands up to repeated viewings, so I highly recommend the film. Besides, it's probably your only opportunity to find out how to make a ""Siberian Mist"".",5,Disparity of response,1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,2187,"['read', 'various', 'reviews', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'amazing', 'array', 'responses', 'think', 'largely', 'function', 'horrid', 'marketing', 'movie', 'When', 'friend', 'recmmended', 'watch', 'did', 'once-over', 'packaging', 'decided', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'insisted', 'so', 'reluctantly', 'agreed', 'watch', 'packaging', 'not', 'sentimental', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Look', 'Who', 'Talking', 'vein', 'sort', 'movie', 'should', 'move', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'this.The', 'movie', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'derelict', 'couple', 'Eddie', 'Moe', 'played', 'real-life', 'spouses', 'Sean', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Penn', 'character', 'dissolute', 'Moe', 'bad', 'position', 'being', 'vulnerable', 'sleazy', 'advances', 'neighbor', 'played', 'well', 'Sopranos', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'When', 'Eddie', 'out', 'what', 'result', 'steadily', 'unhinged', 'performance', 'barroom', 'scene', 'one', 'most', 'convincing', 'portrayals', 'drunken', 'progressive', 'madness', 'have', 'seen', 'film.The', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'benefits', 'mainly', 'introduction', 'John', 'Travolta', 'role', 'mercifully', 'back', 'stretching', 'limited', 'acting', 'range', 'Travolta', 'guiltily', 'derived', 'pleasure', 'decided', 'was', 'mega-action', 'flick', 'star', 'What', 'somewhat', 'unlikely', 'morally', 'emotionally', 'challenged', 'dilemma', 'Moe', 'Robin', 'Penn', 'Wright', 'viewers', 'who', 'tend', 'view', 'life', 'rather', 'black-and-white', 'terms', 'will', 'be', 'horrified', 'portion', 'movie', 'open-minded', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'opportunity', 'analyze', 'various', 'components', 'ensuing', 'relationships', 'positions', 'players', 'troublesome', 'problematic', 'so', 'avoids', 'easy', 'answers', 'judgements', 'What', 'great', 'film', 'other', 'indie', 'films', 'revel', 'dispassion', 'not', 'afraid', 'allow', 'feel', 'characters', 'deeply', 'many', 'flaws', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'movie', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'probably', 'only', 'opportunity', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'Siberian', 'Mist']",She's So Lovely VHS
435869,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,6304798458,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[3, 14]","All I knew about this movie before seeing it was that it had three decently big stars, and a title that suggests a romantic comedy.  I suppose deep down someone with a particular way of looking at things might interpret this as a comedy, and there are certainly romantic feelings expressed by the characters.  But only armed with what I had, this is a movie that turns the world upside down almost from the start.This is the story of mostly people of very low intelligence.  They live in the part of town where their smarts allow them to live, basically skid row.  Just about all of the action takes place in incredibly depressing apartments, or the local bar.Robin Wright Penn is the first of the main characters we meet.  She has barely the smarts to breathe on a regular basis.  She has learned she is pregnant, yet smokes and drinks like everyone else who she associates with.  While her husband is an institution, she has an evening of drinking with a very unlikable James Gandalfini, who beats her when she won't put out to end the romantic get-together.Enter hubby, played by Sean Penn. This character has an even lower IQ than his Mrs. Penn, and is further crippled by being violently insane.  A very ugly incident happens that sends Mr. Penn back to an institution for a very long time.Now my thoughts while watching this film is that this character is not far from the real Sean Penn.  The real Penn has acts of violence in his life, and certainly has done dumb enough things to make you wonder if there's a brain in his head (i.e., marring Madonna, and inspecting for weapons in Iraq).  So I may be one of those people look at this as a comedy of sorts if I pretend that Mr. Penn is not acting.Like I said, the beginning of the movie is startling in the portrayal of how some people live.  The final act begins in a way that is also somewhat startling, in the way you see Mrs. Penn.  You see, she has found John Travolta to marry, and has had kids with them while Mr. Penn has been in the pen for what he considers to be only three months even when he's released.But then it just fizzles out.  REALLY fizzles out.  Now Penn should never have been released period, but hey, they do release people a lot worse.  And the meeting of everybody involved is probably inevitable, but would not have occurred in real life.  They all get together, where Mrs. Penn needs to decide who she's gonna continue with.  The evidently stable guy who pulled her out of squalor and raised a family with her, or Sean Penn.  We never get to really know the Travolta character, and the way the final scenes are handled are more like slapstick comedy than the world the movie started in.  I just wish they could have come up with an ending the befit the first two thirds of the movie.",3,Startling start dies in the stretch,1048636800,"03 26, 2003",2003,2770,"['knew', 'movie', 'seeing', 'was', 'had', 'three', 'decently', 'big', 'stars', 'title', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'suppose', 'deep', 'someone', 'particular', 'way', 'looking', 'things', 'might', 'interpret', 'comedy', 'are', 'certainly', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'expressed', 'characters', 'only', 'armed', 'what', 'had', 'movie', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'almost', 'start.This', 'story', 'mostly', 'people', 'very', 'low', 'intelligence', 'live', 'part', 'town', 'where', 'smarts', 'allow', 'live', 'basically', 'skid', 'row', 'Just', 'action', 'place', 'incredibly', 'depressing', 'apartments', 'local', 'bar.Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'first', 'main', 'characters', 'meet', 'barely', 'smarts', 'breathe', 'regular', 'basis', 'learned', 'pregnant', 'yet', 'smokes', 'drinks', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'husband', 'institution', 'evening', 'drinking', 'very', 'unlikable', 'James', 'Gandalfini', 'who', 'when', 'wo', ""n't"", 'put', 'out', 'end', 'romantic', 'get-together.Enter', 'hubby', 'played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'character', 'even', 'lower', 'IQ', 'Mrs.', 'Penn', 'further', 'crippled', 'being', 'violently', 'insane', 'very', 'ugly', 'incident', 'Mr.', 'Penn', 'back', 'institution', 'very', 'long', 'time.Now', 'thoughts', 'watching', 'film', 'character', 'not', 'far', 'real', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'real', 'Penn', 'acts', 'violence', 'life', 'certainly', 'done', 'dumb', 'enough', 'things', 'make', 'wonder', 'brain', 'head', 'i.e.', 'marring', 'Madonna', 'inspecting', 'weapons', 'Iraq', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'people', 'look', 'comedy', 'sorts', 'pretend', 'Mr.', 'Penn', 'not', 'acting.Like', 'said', 'beginning', 'movie', 'startling', 'portrayal', 'how', 'people', 'live', 'final', 'act', 'way', 'also', 'somewhat', 'startling', 'way', 'see', 'Mrs.', 'Penn', 'see', 'found', 'John', 'Travolta', 'marry', 'had', 'kids', 'Mr.', 'Penn', 'been', 'pen', 'what', 'be', 'only', 'three', 'months', 'even', 'when', 'released.But', 'then', 'just', 'out', 'REALLY', 'out', 'Now', 'Penn', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'period', 'hey', 'do', 'release', 'people', 'lot', 'worse', 'meeting', 'everybody', 'involved', 'probably', 'inevitable', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'occurred', 'real', 'life', 'get', 'together', 'where', 'Mrs.', 'Penn', 'decide', 'who', 'gon', 'continue', 'evidently', 'stable', 'guy', 'who', 'pulled', 'squalor', 'raised', 'family', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'never', 'get', 'really', 'know', 'Travolta', 'character', 'way', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'handled', 'are', 'more', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'world', 'movie', 'started', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'ending', 'befit', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie']",She's So Lovely VHS

I'll just review the movie.The acting was really pulled off quite well. I laughed a little, I smiled some, I yelled at the screen quite a bit. The characters were well defined from meeting them instantly. Before the 10 years later, I was crossing my fingers hoping Mo's character would treat him right, so after the 10 year moment, I was a bit angry. Which is good, because that means the movie did its job and sucked me into it's world.The ending however left me in a bit of shock. The last important line at the end took my breath away, as in that everyone understood Mo and still loved her.I don't think this movie would stand up to multiple ""just me"" viewings, but I wouldn't mind watching it again with someone else just to get their take on it.It's definately something that makes you pause. You don't have to agree with the characters choices because the film doesn't try to say the actions are right or wrong, it just shows you what happens and allows you to decide for yourself. It also makes you think a bit (me as a female anyway) on what I would've done.The ending was appropriate to the movie.

The movie had very good acting one of the main reasons why i kept watching it although i can't stand seeing Sean Pen drama movies. I found his rehabilitation beliveable although he acted like same-old in a couple parts.My major gripe with the movie as with many of the movies i've watched late night, is that the ending left me thinking, ""WTF? why did i watch this?"" because the movie made utterly no sense, i mean no completely stable woman in their right mind would do this because its probably the most selfish thing they could have done. She must've been a little off as well, maybe thats why they made a great couple.
