I thought this movie was entertaining but i can see it as just a tv movie, im not suprised it wasnt in the theatres. It is probably on the same level or a little bit better than the babysitter which also starred Alicia silverstone. Movie is about a girl who is fascinated and interested in crime and detective work. Soon a fellow classmate is murdered and she starts to investigate the case along with the police officer played by ( matt dillon). While shes investigating signs are pointing to dillan as the killer and then things get worse from there.  This was a pretty good thriller and if you like this i recomend the crush and the babysitter as well. Overall good story.",4,I liked this,1081123200,"04 5, 2004",2004,727,"['like', 'most', 'movies', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'i', 'can', 'see', 'as', 'just', 'tv', 'movie', 'not', 'suprised', 'wasnt', 'theatres', 'probably', 'same', 'level', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'babysitter', 'also', 'starred', 'Alicia', 'silverstone', 'Movie', 'girl', 'who', 'fascinated', 'interested', 'crime', 'detective', 'work', 'Soon', 'fellow', 'classmate', 'murdered', 'investigate', 'case', 'police', 'officer', 'played', 'matt', 'dillon', 'shes', 'investigating', 'signs', 'are', 'pointing', 'dillan', 'killer', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'there', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'thriller', 'like', 'i', 'recomend', 'crush', 'babysitter', 'as', 'well', 'Overall', 'good', 'story']",True Crime

If you can tolerate some slow parts, and ignore the sophomoric and silly dream sequences that clutter up the movie, it's very well acted by Silverstone and Dillon.  Bottom line: it's a one hour movie wrapped in a 94 minute package, but the  one hour inside is pretty darn good.",2,Almost a Fine Thriller,963792000,"07 17, 2000",2000,324,"['enjoyable', 'movie', 'needed', 'good', 'editor', 'can', 'tolerate', 'slow', 'parts', 'ignore', 'sophomoric', 'silly', 'dream', 'sequences', 'clutter', 'up', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'Silverstone', 'Dillon', 'Bottom', 'line', 'one', 'hour', 'movie', 'wrapped', '94', 'minute', 'package', 'one', 'hour', 'inside', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good']",True Crime
190451,A1HO9J4DCQDGP9,157362554X,"Kali ""bengaligirl""","[8, 11]","This is a good thriller despite the fact many critics panned it.  Alicia Silverstone is excellent as the virginal Mary Giordano who wants to follow in her dead father's footsteps and become a police officer.  Secretly investigating some recent teenage murders Alicia finds herself in mortal danger from a madman who knows more about her than she realizes. Billy Nunn is great as a cynical older Cop who knew Alicia's father and tries to tell the eager young woman she shouldn't romanticize crime. Aided and abetted by a sexy young cop played well by Kevin Dillon, Alicia is drawn into a web of deceit and desire that just might kill her if she is not careful.  There is a wonderful sting in the tale that will shock you (if you don't work it out first) and the plot and acting is first rate.  Another underrated film that deserves more merit than it is given.",5,Above average thriller,976147200,"12 7, 2000",2000,859,"['good', 'thriller', 'fact', 'many', 'critics', 'panned', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'excellent', 'virginal', 'Mary', 'Giordano', 'who', 'follow', 'dead', 'father', 'footsteps', 'become', 'police', 'officer', 'Secretly', 'investigating', 'recent', 'teenage', 'murders', 'Alicia', 'mortal', 'danger', 'madman', 'who', 'more', 'Billy', 'Nunn', 'great', 'cynical', 'older', 'Cop', 'who', 'knew', 'Alicia', 'father', 'tries', 'tell', 'eager', 'young', 'woman', 'should', ""n't"", 'romanticize', 'crime', 'Aided', 'abetted', 'sexy', 'young', 'cop', 'played', 'well', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'Alicia', 'drawn', 'web', 'deceit', 'desire', 'just', 'might', 'kill', 'not', 'careful', 'wonderful', 'sting', 'tale', 'will', 'shock', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'first', 'plot', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'underrated', 'film', 'more', 'merit', 'given']",True Crime
