You can't really tell if everything that happens in the film is &#34;real&#34; or just in the main character's head. A young man goes to his mother's house after her death. He hasn't been there for a long time because of their estrangement. He starts to experience odd things in the house. There are flashes of an odd backstory where his mother was part of this weird angel-worshipping cult. The strange stuff keeps escalating. You get the idea that the guy isn't stable as his mother's treatment of him when he was young bordered on psychological abuse. He calls his therapist/girlfriend(?) several times during the movie when the house really werids him out. The tension mounts with lots of eerie effects. We hardly ever see anyone else in the house except this troubled young man. He seems lonely and isolated. He never really comes to any conclusions about what he sees in the house while he's there. You get the idea that he's there for curiosity's sake because his mother is dead rather than actually wanting to be in the house on a more permanent basis. During one particularly creepy night where things are moving around the house (the creature? some mysterious cultists?) he freaks out and calls his therapist who convinces him this is all in his head. He eventually leaves the house and the story seems to end but it really kind of doesn't end. I don't want to ruin the end but I found this to be the perfect creepy movie with some great acting and nice special effects.,4,"Really, really creepy!",1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,1546,"['movie', 'review', 'title', 'strange', 'creepy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'everything', 'film', '34', 'real', '34', 'just', 'main', 'character', 'head', 'young', 'man', 'mother', 'house', 'death', ""n't"", 'been', 'there', 'long', 'time', 'estrangement', 'experience', 'odd', 'things', 'house', 'are', 'flashes', 'odd', 'backstory', 'where', 'mother', 'was', 'part', 'weird', 'angel-worshipping', 'cult', 'strange', 'stuff', 'keeps', 'escalating', 'get', 'idea', 'guy', ""n't"", 'stable', 'mother', 'treatment', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'bordered', 'psychological', 'abuse', 'therapist/girlfriend', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'when', 'house', 'really', 'out', 'tension', 'mounts', 'lots', 'eerie', 'effects', 'hardly', 'ever', 'see', 'anyone', 'else', 'house', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'lonely', 'isolated', 'never', 'really', 'conclusions', 'what', 'house', 'there', 'get', 'idea', 'there', 'curiosity', 'sake', 'mother', 'dead', 'rather', 'actually', 'wanting', 'be', 'house', 'more', 'permanent', 'basis', 'one', 'particularly', 'creepy', 'night', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'moving', 'house', 'creature', 'mysterious', 'cultists', 'out', 'therapist', 'who', 'head', 'eventually', 'house', 'story', 'end', 'really', 'kind', ""n't"", 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'end', 'found', 'be', 'perfect', 'creepy', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'nice', 'special', 'effects']",Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh

The old canard about the setting being a character in and of itself&#8212;it really works here. Considering that 80% of the movie is poor Aaron Poole as Leon Leigh, Surveillance Expert, stumbling and bumbling around in the dark of the house he just inherited from his mother Rosalind (Vanessa Redgrave, present mainly through voice over). There's a lot creepy here. It's a creepy movie, pure creepy. When you think about it, creepy is one of the subtlest forms of fear, much more difficult to achieve than scary, frightening, dreadful or horrific. There are weird old saying hanging on the wall in Rosalind's needlework: If a knife falls, a man will arrive, if a spoon falls a woman will arrive, if a fork falls it will be neither a man nor a woman. And klutzy Aaron of course drops a fork and who shows up at the door? Well, we never see his/her face, but the voice (Julian Richings) is weirdly abstracted, and the visitor talks of a strange beast loose in the neighborhood, a beast which later comes and licks Leon's face as he sleeps. There's the weird voice that leads Leon toward a transcendental experience where the whole house fills with soothing white light, and then there's Aaron's friend (girlfriend?) Anna (Charlotte Sullivan) who leads Aaron through this relaxing visualization exercise that requires him to close his eyes and be still as we can tell that there is something huge and hulking stomping down the hallway toward him, at last casting a massive shadow across his face. And when she tells him to open his eyes? Well, you'll just have to watch to find out!",5,As Creepy As It Gets!,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",2014,1634,"['one', 'must-see', 'honor', 'do', ""n't"", 'grant', 'lightly', 'old', 'canard', 'setting', 'being', 'character', '8212', 'really', 'here', 'Considering', '80', '%', 'movie', 'poor', 'Aaron', 'Poole', 'Leon', 'Leigh', 'Surveillance', 'Expert', 'stumbling', 'bumbling', 'around', 'dark', 'house', 'just', 'inherited', 'mother', 'Rosalind', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'present', 'mainly', 'voice', 'lot', 'creepy', 'here', 'creepy', 'movie', 'pure', 'creepy', 'When', 'think', 'creepy', 'one', 'subtlest', 'forms', 'fear', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'achieve', 'scary', 'frightening', 'dreadful', 'horrific', 'are', 'weird', 'old', 'saying', 'hanging', 'wall', 'Rosalind', 'needlework', 'knife', 'man', 'will', 'arrive', 'spoon', 'woman', 'will', 'arrive', 'fork', 'will', 'be', 'man', 'woman', 'klutzy', 'Aaron', 'course', 'fork', 'who', 'up', 'door', 'Well', 'never', 'see', 'his/her', 'face', 'voice', 'Julian', 'Richings', 'weirdly', 'abstracted', 'visitor', 'talks', 'strange', 'beast', 'loose', 'neighborhood', 'beast', 'later', 'Leon', 'face', 'weird', 'voice', 'Leon', 'transcendental', 'experience', 'where', 'whole', 'house', 'fills', 'soothing', 'white', 'light', 'then', 'Aaron', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'Anna', 'Charlotte', 'Sullivan', 'who', 'Aaron', 'relaxing', 'visualization', 'exercise', 'close', 'eyes', 'be', 'still', 'can', 'tell', 'something', 'huge', 'hulking', 'stomping', 'down', 'hallway', 'last', 'casting', 'massive', 'shadow', 'face', 'when', 'open', 'eyes', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out']",Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh

1642859,A2ZAL8QPY3ABQH,B00C6F622M,Dustin J. Isenberg,"[8, 9]","I've been waiting in anticipation for this movie to become available for home viewing. I've heard many positive things about it as well as the production and I was eagerly ready to soak up a fresh take on the ghost story. This movie definitely sufficed! I will say that it is not a movie for everyone but even the veteran horror fans should be pleased and find much to love about it. It is a slow burn, for sure. For a ghost story, that works to its advantage. You're not quite sure what is going on within the first 15 minutes but it soon becomes clear that the director had far more on his mind than what he's leading on. The Gothic details throughout the house are simply incredible and very eerie with lots of creepy imagery. There is a narration by the wonderful Vanessa Redgrave who plays the deceased Rosalind Leigh throughout the length of the film. Normally this would seem an annoying detraction but it suits this film quite well and adds to the unease you will feel while wandering through the house with the protagonist. There are definitely things that go bump-in-the-nite here and will have the hairs on the back of your neck standing straight up. The tension mounting in this film is really remarkable! Does the ending hold up as well as the rest of the film? For me, not quite. It's not as cohesive as the rest of the movie but it didn't really bother me. It's still a fitting ending and definitely unlike any other ghost story you'll encounter! I highly recommend searching this one out! I feel like the horror genre is more of a letdown anymore but this film helped put my mind at ease that there is still hope! I was really in the mood for a good scary movie and this one delivered in spades! Simple and elegant with beautiful cinematography and wonderful talent to all involved!",4,Simple and Elegant.

1642860,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00C6F622M,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[5, 9]","Good ghost stories are not only hard to find but also they're increasing hard to make.  Audiences have grown enamored of so much pomp and circumstance - along with the occasional slashed throat and/or bared breasts - that it's hard to rustle up some legitimate scares that stick in their mind into of as flickers of a celluloid experience.  It could be that we've grown a bit too long in the tooth as a society to accept that ghosts are ... well, they're `something' of a sort that defies a conventional explanation.  Those who go looking for them might be shocked by what they find, but, sadly, most viewers tune out stories that are too much story and not enough flash.THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF ROSALIND LEIGH presents a modern `take' on the old ghost story - a woman haunted by her own personal past comes to grips with what it'll be like to remain forever alone.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and character.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Leon (played with Ambien-style restraint by Aaron Poole) goes `home' to his deceased mother's house to account for his inheritance.  However, there's a dark and ominous force at work in the dwelling, and, if he's not careful in what he believes, the thing might just have a thing or two to say about his survival.THE LAST WILL has been the recipient of some generous critical buzz, most of which comes from the festival circuit and/or promotional copies provided to interested media outlets.  In his quest to find an audience for the picture, writer/director Rodrigo Gudino has built up an impressive roster of award citations.  It won ""Best Film"" at the 2012 South African Horrorfest.  It also was the ""Audience Jury Prize"" for the 2012 Siena International Film Festival.  It received a ""Special Mention"" at the 2012 Morbido Film Festival.  Furthermore, it won ""Best Cinematography"" at the 2012 Buenos Aires Rojo Sangre Film Festival.Winning awards is one thing; entertaining audiences isn't so easy.I have absolutely no problem giving LAST WILL the highest possible mention for its cinematography, which is astoundingly superb from start-to-finish.  Seriously, it's the kind of work that warrants further study, and I've no doubt that film school students and cinema academics will be mesmerized by the impressive camera work.  Sadly, there's so little teeth to this - it's a traditional, old-school ghost story - and that's hard for audiences to get all that excited about.Poole does the best he can with the highly atmospheric material and locations - the house is a puzzle unto itself, and the set d&eacute;cor is hauntingly brilliant.  Still, it's hard to elevate the story beyond the mundane, especially when you're essentially the only living person in the film.  (There are other characters who appear via telephone or on the other side of a closed door; and, yes, there are a couple of faces tucked in nice and neat near the end, but that's it.)  As he's cornered with no one to physically react to and against, he's left doing everything; as much as I'd like to offer some modest praise for his performance, it just didn't show all that much range.Is that his fault?  Well, not really.  Unfortunately, he's sheltered into this house by Gudino.  As a puppetmaster of all things in LAST WILL, he only does an affable job so far as this Average Joe of a critic is concerned.  Yes, it's interesting; it just ain't all that memorable.THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF ROSALIND LEIGH (2012) is produced by Someone At The Door Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled by RLJ Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, let me be perfectly clear: the picture looks and sounds pretty downright incredible, and it boasts some fascinatingly complex cinematography - the kind of stuff one would expect from a quality ghost story.  (I just wish it were all more entertaining.)  Bucking the trend with horror releases, the folks behind this one have ponied up a wonderful assortment of special features: there's an audio commentary with writer/director Gudino, an extensive making-of short, a `Mercan Dede' feature, a poster gallery, some nifty photos from the production, and a short film (THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF MISTER HOLLOW) also from Gudino's personal vault.  Impressive, indeed.RECOMMENDED.  Entirely atmospheric, yes, but that's about all it is.  It's a nice `contemporization' of psychological horror, but at 80 minutes it's probably 30 minutes longer than it need be.  Good ghost stories are hard to find, and THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF ROSALIND LEIGH is sprinkled with a healthy amount of good ideas, only they're spaced out too far and between scenes of downright `dullery.'  Visually, it's the creepy old house that takes center stage, leaving Aaron Poole mostly in the role as set dressing.  I've no doubt it'll find an audience will film scholars, cinematography nerds, and maybe horror purists, but this one?  It ain't for the masses ... unless they're still awake.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of THE LAST

1642861,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B00C6F622M,.fgd,"[0, 0]","I love this film for its originality and a grounded , plausible, under-stated approach to the occult. I say under-stated because there is an implied story behind the film that does its job well by implication. It is that his mother joined a cult. The father commits suicide or was he driven to it? Leon as a child is perturbed by the influence of the cult and by the time he is old enough to leave , he has distanced himself enough from the cult and her, to be able to leave. Leon seems to have few childhood memories, which builds suprising tensions during the film.There is one superb instance when Leon is approched by a cult member or is it a demon in human disguise although all we hear is its voice. A terrible, insiduous refined voice at that. Unforgetable.Vanessa Redgrave is wonderful as the voice of the ghost of the mother. An actress of her calibre raised the quality of this film considerably. Very well cast and thank god it was not Judy Dench!!! The actor playing Leon is low-key but it works since the lead one is the mother. Meanwhile the camera pans on an old house crammed with the fetishes of his mother's subconcious mind : old dolls, odd antique knick-knacks etc... well before the camera hones in on its christian-pagan statues.

Murdoch ""Creative Sparkplug""","[1, 2]","Some of the previous reviews do a great job summarizing what they story was about (or at least they put out some good theories) so if you're trying to figure out what was going on, check a few of the other reviews voted most helpful.The production is great. A lot of care and thought was put into evoking a moody, disquieting, and ultimately spooky atmosphere.Where the film fell short for me was trying to accomplish too much without involving me on an emotional level. I know I found it tedious and boring and as intrigued as I was, I just didn't care enough to want to sit through to the end.There are tons of interesting ideas explored: the relationship between mothers and their children, the nature of belief, limits of religious cults, whether a cult however well-intended it's practitioners is ultimately damaging, the effects of loneliness and mental illness. Each idea by itself can be a rich foundation on which to create a film.The problem is The Last Testament tries to tackle them all in one film and a limited film at that.I guess just that fact that these themes came through is a positive comment on the director's abilities.Still it seems crazy ambitious to take on all these themes in a one-actor film. And the actor in this film is good but at the same time doesn't reveal much of the character's interior world. Even if you take the argument that ultimately we're being shown the mother's memories and limited knowledge of her son as a person, I'd argue back that without a multi-dimensional character, it's difficult to develop empathy for the character and without the ability for audience members to project themselves into the story, it remains a cerebral exercise and ultimately unsatisfying.The only ""real"" character is Vanessa Redgrave as the narrator, Rosalind Leigh with whom I did feel empathy.As I write this, it occurs to me that ultimately, The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh is a tragedy with supernatural trappings.And for a tragedy to do something more than leave the audience feeling depressed and despairing, the ending requires a lesson to help the audience put the events into a larger perspective. For example, an individual tragedy teaches the community a lesson about tolerance.Alas there is no perspective or lesson learned in this film making it interesting and atmospheric but ultimately an exercise in existential despair.Some people have a taste for this type of film. But if you're like me and you like a little meaning at the end of lots of trials and tribulations, look elsewhere for a good, spooky film to watch.",2,Ambitious but ultimately unsatisfying,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,2576,"['previous', 'reviews', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'summarizing', 'what', 'story', 'was', 'least', 'put', 'out', 'good', 'theories', 'so', ""'re"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'check', 'few', 'other', 'reviews', 'voted', 'most', 'helpful.The', 'production', 'great', 'lot', 'care', 'thought', 'was', 'put', 'evoking', 'moody', 'disquieting', 'ultimately', 'spooky', 'atmosphere.Where', 'film', 'fell', 'short', 'was', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'too', 'much', 'involving', 'emotional', 'level', 'know', 'found', 'tedious', 'boring', 'as', 'intrigued', 'was', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'want', 'sit', 'end.There', 'are', 'tons', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'explored', 'relationship', 'mothers', 'children', 'nature', 'belief', 'limits', 'religious', 'cults', 'cult', 'however', 'well-intended', 'practitioners', 'ultimately', 'damaging', 'effects', 'loneliness', 'mental', 'illness', 'idea', 'can', 'be', 'rich', 'foundation', 'create', 'film.The', 'problem', 'Last', 'Testament', 'tries', 'tackle', 'one', 'film', 'limited', 'film', 'that.I', 'guess', 'just', 'fact', 'themes', 'came', 'through', 'positive', 'comment', 'director', 'abilities.Still', 'crazy', 'ambitious', 'take', 'themes', 'one-actor', 'film', 'actor', 'film', 'good', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'much', 'character', 'interior', 'world', 'Even', 'take', 'argument', 'ultimately', ""'re"", 'being', 'shown', 'mother', 'memories', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'son', 'person', ""'d"", 'argue', 'back', 'multi-dimensional', 'character', 'difficult', 'develop', 'empathy', 'character', 'ability', 'audience', 'members', 'project', 'story', 'cerebral', 'exercise', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying.The', 'only', 'real', 'character', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'narrator', 'Rosalind', 'Leigh', 'whom', 'did', 'feel', 'empathy.As', 'write', 'ultimately', 'Last', 'Will', 'Testament', 'Rosalind', 'Leigh', 'tragedy', 'supernatural', 'trappings.And', 'tragedy', 'do', 'something', 'more', 'leave', 'audience', 'feeling', 'depressed', 'despairing', 'ending', 'lesson', 'help', 'audience', 'put', 'events', 'larger', 'perspective', 'example', 'individual', 'tragedy', 'community', 'lesson', 'tolerance.Alas', 'perspective', 'lesson', 'learned', 'film', 'making', 'interesting', 'atmospheric', 'ultimately', 'exercise', 'existential', 'despair.Some', 'people', 'have', 'taste', 'type', 'film', ""'re"", 'like', 'little', 'meaning', 'end', 'lots', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'good', 'spooky', 'film', 'watch']",Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh
1642867,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00C6F622M,John's Horror Corner,"[17, 18]","A solid success for a writer/director with a small budget on his first feature length film.  I'm excited to see what this guy does next.  Amid the constantly recycled concepts and axioms that both plague and serve as hallmarks for the horror genre, this film manages to stand out as original. The story is nothing wowing and the horror elements are technically not unique.  But the approach was!  Because of this, I struggle to compare this to any other horror.After her passing and leaving everything to her only son, antiquities dealer and atheist Leon (Aaron Poole) visits his estranged mother's (Vanessa Redgrave) home which is neatly, but densely decorated with all manner and medium of Christian--and not so Christian--artifacts, making it somewhat unsettling.  The house is also littered with stitched and framed religious adages formed into strange warnings.The recently deceased Rosalind Leigh (Vanessa Redgrave; Nip/Tuck) narrates, explaining her distance from her son, her deep religious beliefs and Leon's resentful distance from the faith.  In this modern approach to a classic-style ghost story Rosalind, haunted by her past, learns what it will be like to remain forever alone.There is plenty of creepy in this house of angel statues and forces which would prey on the non-believers dwelling within.  As we question where Leon's soul will fall on the counterbalance weighing Leon's lack of faith against those powers that would claim his ungrateful soul, he his hunted by some manner of beast outside the house.This film features only one character that we ""see.""  There are many represented by video or voice (as by phone call), but we watch only Leon interact with his surroundings.  His therapist girlfriend remotely leads Leon and us viewers to question if Leon is going mad, or if he really is being hunted by an other-worldly evil.Writer/director Rodrigo Gudi&ntilde;o shows us some proficient camera work.  Nothing spectacular, but he serves his film well.  The CGI effects are better when they're not the focus of the shot.  Briefly animated statues elicit expected uneasy jumps and the beast, when framed in a shadowy corner, is scary and of off-putting form.  But when it comes to fully revealing the creature via close-ups or action, it's just some anorexic werewolf-looking thing from a ScyFy movie-of-the-week.The poor quality CGI and use of a single on screen actor help inform us of the small budget Gudi&ntilde;o had at his disposal for his first feature length film.  Being the lone actor, Aaron Poole faced an unusual challenge having no one with whom he could directly interact.  So don't be too quick to criticize his performance or Gudi&ntilde;o's story staging.  I'd love to see what Gudi&ntilde;o could do with even a small studio budget for a theatrical release.  He has good ideas and a proficiency that exceeds most horror filmmakers of such limited experience.See this, be mindful of Gudi&ntilde;o's financial limitations and get stoked for the day this guy gets a budget and some more actors to direct.",4,"Finally, a horror film that manages to stand out as original",1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,3045,"['solid', 'success', 'writer/director', 'small', 'budget', 'first', 'feature', 'length', 'film', ""'m"", 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'guy', 'next', 'constantly', 'recycled', 'concepts', 'axioms', 'plague', 'serve', 'hallmarks', 'horror', 'genre', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'original', 'story', 'nothing', 'wowing', 'horror', 'elements', 'are', 'technically', 'not', 'unique', 'approach', 'was', 'struggle', 'compare', 'other', 'horror.After', 'passing', 'leaving', 'everything', 'only', 'son', 'antiquities', 'dealer', 'atheist', 'Leon', 'Aaron', 'Poole', 'estranged', 'mother', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'home', 'neatly', 'densely', 'decorated', 'manner', 'medium', 'Christian', 'not', 'so', 'Christian', 'artifacts', 'making', 'somewhat', 'unsettling', 'house', 'also', 'littered', 'stitched', 'framed', 'religious', 'adages', 'formed', 'strange', 'warnings.The', 'recently', 'deceased', 'Rosalind', 'Leigh', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Nip/Tuck', 'explaining', 'distance', 'son', 'deep', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'Leon', 'resentful', 'distance', 'faith', 'modern', 'approach', 'classic-style', 'ghost', 'story', 'Rosalind', 'haunted', 'past', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'remain', 'forever', 'alone.There', 'plenty', 'creepy', 'house', 'angel', 'statues', 'forces', 'would', 'prey', 'non-believers', 'dwelling', 'question', 'where', 'Leon', 'soul', 'will', 'fall', 'counterbalance', 'weighing', 'Leon', 'lack', 'faith', 'powers', 'would', 'claim', 'ungrateful', 'soul', 'hunted', 'manner', 'beast', 'house.This', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'character', 'see', 'are', 'many', 'represented', 'video', 'voice', 'phone', 'call', 'watch', 'only', 'Leon', 'interact', 'surroundings', 'therapist', 'girlfriend', 'remotely', 'Leon', 'viewers', 'question', 'Leon', 'going', 'mad', 'really', 'being', 'hunted', 'other-worldly', 'evil.Writer/director', 'Rodrigo', 'Gudi', 'ntilde', 'o', 'proficient', 'camera', 'work', 'Nothing', 'spectacular', 'film', 'well', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'better', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'focus', 'shot', 'Briefly', 'animated', 'statues', 'elicit', 'expected', 'uneasy', 'jumps', 'beast', 'when', 'framed', 'shadowy', 'corner', 'scary', 'off-putting', 'form', 'when', 'fully', 'revealing', 'creature', 'close-ups', 'action', 'just', 'anorexic', 'werewolf-looking', 'thing', 'ScyFy', 'movie-of-the-week.The', 'poor', 'quality', 'CGI', 'use', 'single', 'screen', 'actor', 'help', 'inform', 'small', 'budget', 'Gudi', 'ntilde', 'had', 'disposal', 'first', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'Being', 'lone', 'actor', 'Aaron', 'Poole', 'faced', 'unusual', 'challenge', 'having', 'one', 'whom', 'could', 'directly', 'interact', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'quick', 'criticize', 'performance', 'Gudi', 'ntilde', 'story', 'staging', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'what', 'Gudi', 'ntilde', 'o', 'could', 'do', 'even', 'small', 'studio', 'budget', 'theatrical', 'release', 'good', 'ideas', 'proficiency', 'most', 'horror', 'filmmakers', 'such', 'limited', 'experience.See', 'be', 'mindful', 'Gudi', 'ntilde', 'financial', 'limitations', 'get', 'stoked', 'day', 'guy', 'budget', 'more', 'actors', 'direct']",Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh

In a horror pic, I do prefer mood over action, slow boiled tension over cheap scares, but here there was absolutely no tension whatsoever. There was nothing really at stake. I also enjoy carefully planned ambiguity, and seeing that word along with 'conceptual' in so many reviews below, I was hopeful. But the concept is poorly thrown together, very loose and without lasting impact, and there is no real ambiguity present. Questions, yes, but not ambiguity (there's a big difference between the two). In general, it felt like dime store philosophy trying to pass itself off as 'deep'. Trust me, there's no actual depth here.The skeleton of the plot sounds intriguing: a nonbeliever, who was brought up in a torturously religious household, returns to his dead mother's icon-cluttered home. It's supposed to be about loneliness, about regret, about the distance between family members, and about whether faith is a waste of time or is grounded in the real. Instead, we get some vague clamor about a cult, some CGI creature that looks like a cross between a werewolf and Golem, and a sullen man pacing a big house making stupid decisions at every turn.If you like your paranormal drama (it's not a horror film) to pretend to be about something without actually succeeding, then you might enjoy this film more than I did.

1642870,A1STTYJMTNM59U,B00C6F622M,"Mike Bartlett ""Mike Bartlett""","[0, 1]","I had high hopes for this film which I ended up seeing through Amazon Instant Video.  The director's first short film, THE EYES OF EDWARD JAMES, is hands down, one of the best and original short films I have ever seen.One hesitation I had with the movie was that he went on to make another short entitled THE DEMONOLOGY OF DESIRE that threw out plot in favor of style.  I was worried that LWATORL would be more like that film than EYES, and sadly I was right.The film is about a man who inherits a house after his mother passes away.  It's a great concept especially as he finds out a lot about his mother through various scribblings and junk in the house that belongs to her.  There is a ton of voice over as the diaries are ready out.  And that's really all there is to the story - and it sadly exposes the terrible writing behind the narration. A rather cool CGI monsters crops up near the end - which also mirrors DEMONOLOGY which also features a random CGI monster thrown in for what seems to be no reason relevant to the plot.  However I accept that maybe I am just missing something.  It could just be that this is not my kind of film.  But I will say this - I like slow burning horror films (This was TOO slow, mainly to lack of plot), I love creepy horror (This had no atmosphere) and I love a good ending - and to the filmmaker's credit the ending had a nice twist.  But it did not justify the 80 or so minutes that went before it.On a positive note the CGI creature and the cinematography are both nicely done.

Her home is a foreboding house filled with winding staircases and creepy antique angel statues, figures, painting, and various other strange objects. The floors and doors creek and the dim light cast shadows across it's dark walls.But there is something dark within it's walls. Soon. Leon begins to feel there is someone there with him. Messages are written for him. Items of meaning are placed by him.All the while, the film is narrated by Vanessa Redgrave as Leon's mother. And as the film unfolds, so does her loneliness and heartbreak as she tries to communicate with Leon from beyond the grave.This film is not for everyone. It is very moody and arty.

1642873,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00C6F622M,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh (Rodrigo Gudi&ntilde;o, 2012)One of the Facebook groups to which I subscribe is a fan club for Welsh author Wayne Simmons. Every once in a while one of the moderators will pop out one of those 'what are you listening to right now?&#8221; questions. A month or so ago, it was &#8220;what horror film are you most looking forward to seeing?&#8221; From those across the pond, the answer was close to unanimous (and close to instantaneous)&#8212;The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh. I'd heard of the film before, but the only thing that had stuck in my mind was that Vanessa Redgrave starred. Last week, it showed up on Netflix Instant, and I remembered that thread, so I fired it up and sat down to give it a go. They were right, every one of them; this movie lived up to the hype and then some. That said, while it treads the line between supernatural drama and horror&#8212;Gudi&ntilde;o is certainly exploring the former in this film, though he throws in enough jumps to keep fans of the latter interested&#8212;it is that rare beast that, I think, will satisfy fans of both genres.Plot: Rosalind Leigh (Vanessa Redgrave, whose last foray into big-screen horror was the infamous 1971 film The Devils) has died recently; we never actually see her, except in video footage, but she narrates the film. Its actual main character is Leon (The Conspiracy's Aaron Poole), her son, who has returned to the family pile in order to put Rosalind's affairs in order, get her things sold, etc. He knew, we discover early on, that she was involved in a weird new age cult; on his first night staying in the house, however, he discovers she was much more involved than he knew, and that the cult may be more dangerous than he suspected.There are obvious echoes of a number of other movies here, ranging from any selection of Hammer classics you can name to the more recent Lovely Molly and Kill List, but Gudi&ntilde;o, who also wrote, has his own vision and his own voice, and there is no question of The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh is its own film. As with many of the more recent horror films I have found myself loving, this is slow, introspective, much more on the atmosphere side of things than the jump side of things. If you were that guy (the only person in the room, or on the planet maybe, who actually liked, say, An American Haunting), then The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh is not the movie for you. If you like character-driven films that aim to disturb rather than scare, where the queasiness in your belly comes from what you see out of the corner of your eye rather than the buckets of fake blood the special effects guy used, this movie is going to be right up your alley.
