I think it is a terrible shame that it happened and worse, a lot worse happens elsewhere. Others have told the gist of the movie so i will only say that the prologue and epilogue are written in French in movie but are added in English as special features.  The only other thing i will say is that it didn't end the way i wanted.  the hero......well, yin find out, it worth a look",5,stunning-- and sadly based on a true story,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,464,"['subtitles', 'times', 'go', 'too', 'fast', 'movies', 'very', 'well', 'shot', 'acted', 'think', 'terrible', 'shame', 'happened', 'worse', 'lot', 'worse', 'elsewhere', 'Others', 'have', 'told', 'gist', 'movie', 'i', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'prologue', 'epilogue', 'are', 'written', 'French', 'movie', 'are', 'added', 'English', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'i', 'will', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'way', 'i', 'wanted', 'hero', 'well', 'find', 'out', 'look']",The Boy from Lebanon

1033806,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B000KGGISM,Gerard D. Launay,"[18, 18]","A must see film about the horror of child terrorists and soldiers...not just for society at large but for these young adults as well.  The film opens with a boy being sold by his Lebanese parents to become a child solider who is indoctrinated (as Number 3) to hate Jews and Gentiles. He becomes an excellent soldier for the cause of hate and is then flown to France to fulfill a mission to assassinate the President of France. A true story.Filmed as a thriller - documentary style - the master terrorists have everything planned to the last detail but this...they failed to consider the impact of a friendship this young boy develops for a Parisian boy his own age. The most touching scene is the gentleness in which the French boy comforts the young soldier who is deeply troubled by nightmares in losing his parents and his innocence.  And the most haunting line of the film, spoken by the child soldier - ""what's it like being a boy.""",5,Can we educate children to hate and kill?

I don't understand the tags, there's not so much as a shirtless scene anywhere in the movie, everyone is fully dressed for winter in Europe, no gay or romantic scenes, and I wouldn't call it coming-of-age they are really young.

1033808,A1TVILUSPJTOS3,B000KGGISM,Mr. B,"[0, 0]","I owned this DVD a few years ago, but I gave it to a young friend to help him think more critically about current events.  As an educator/social worker who had extensive experience with youth, I found the ""formation"" of this young boy into a killer fascinating. From his background, it was understandable that he could be malleable, but he, also, never forgot that he was ""sold"". Children think critically much more then we give them credit.  A turning point in his life was having a friend his age for the first time.  It obviously deeply impacted him.  I confess that I took unholy delight in his execution of the ""bad guys"".  I was glad to read in the ""footnotes"" that he went on to be a successful student and hopefully have a positive adult future. I was not surprised that his friend became another casualty of urban poverty and addiction.  I recommend that adults share this film with youth to show them that everything is not so black and white.  I think that it can be helpful in developing critical thinking.",5,Be careful what you wish for!,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,1018,"['owned', 'DVD', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'gave', 'young', 'friend', 'help', 'think', 'more', 'critically', 'current', 'events', 'educator/social', 'worker', 'who', 'had', 'extensive', 'experience', 'youth', 'found', 'formation', 'young', 'boy', 'killer', 'fascinating', 'background', 'was', 'understandable', 'could', 'be', 'malleable', 'also', 'never', 'forgot', 'was', 'sold', 'Children', 'think', 'critically', 'much', 'more', 'then', 'give', 'credit', 'turning', 'point', 'life', 'was', 'having', 'friend', 'age', 'first', 'time', 'obviously', 'deeply', 'impacted', 'confess', 'took', 'unholy', 'delight', 'execution', 'bad', 'guys', 'was', 'glad', 'read', 'footnotes', 'went', 'be', 'successful', 'student', 'hopefully', 'have', 'positive', 'adult', 'future', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'friend', 'became', 'casualty', 'urban', 'poverty', 'addiction', 'recommend', 'adults', 'share', 'film', 'youth', 'show', 'everything', 'not', 'so', 'black', 'white', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'helpful', 'developing', 'critical', 'thinking']",The Boy from Lebanon
