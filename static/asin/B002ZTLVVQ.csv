1314464,A1II2ZRPKZAQQD,B002ZTLVVQ,"Amy Mcfarland ""Mom of 2""","[21, 25]","My children love the Backyardigans.  They get limited TV each day, and they always pick Backyardigans when it's time to watch something.  It's a terrific show for preschoolers - singing, dancing, adventures, friends.  We have most of their DVDs, and just about all are wonderful start to finish.When I saw this new DVD, I knew my kids would be thrilled.  None of these episodes have aired on TV (at least that we've seen) and they're all pretty good.  My son loves the Los Galacticos, as it features a space ship with aliens (Uniqua and Austin) trying to put green goo on everything in sight.  Also included is the Sock Factory and Escape the Tower.The downfall for this DVD is that it features only three episodes, and none of them are double-length.  For the fourth episode, the makers put a Freshbeat Band episode on.  Thumbs down!!  Had this been marketed for less than the other DVDs, I would have felt far less cheated.  Since all of their other DVDs have had four episodes (or 3 with one being double-length) this one seems like it's been thrown together and packaged with filler. Did they not want to wait for a fourth episode before going to production?? Are they using this to push the Freshbeat Band?Bottom line, these are cute episodes.  Not quite as good as Super Secret Super Spy or Mighty Knights, but cute and typical for Backyardigans.  Worth the full price since there's a half hour of advertising?  Debatable.",3,Only three episodes,1270857600,"04 10, 2010",2010,1428,"['children', 'love', 'Backyardigans', 'get', 'limited', 'TV', 'day', 'always', 'pick', 'Backyardigans', 'when', 'time', 'watch', 'something', 'terrific', 'show', 'preschoolers', 'singing', 'dancing', 'adventures', 'friends', 'have', 'most', 'DVDs', 'just', 'are', 'wonderful', 'start', 'finish.When', 'saw', 'new', 'DVD', 'knew', 'kids', 'would', 'be', 'thrilled', 'None', 'episodes', 'have', 'aired', 'TV', 'least', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'good', 'son', 'Los', 'Galacticos', 'space', 'ship', 'aliens', 'Uniqua', 'Austin', 'trying', 'put', 'green', 'goo', 'everything', 'sight', 'Also', 'included', 'Sock', 'Factory', 'Escape', 'Tower.The', 'downfall', 'DVD', 'only', 'three', 'episodes', 'none', 'are', 'double-length', 'fourth', 'episode', 'makers', 'put', 'Freshbeat', 'Band', 'episode', 'Thumbs', 'down', 'Had', 'been', 'marketed', 'less', 'other', 'DVDs', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'far', 'less', 'cheated', 'other', 'DVDs', 'have', 'had', 'four', 'episodes', '3', 'one', 'being', 'double-length', 'one', 'been', 'thrown', 'together', 'packaged', 'filler', 'Did', 'not', 'want', 'wait', 'fourth', 'episode', 'going', 'production', 'Are', 'using', 'push', 'Freshbeat', 'Band', 'Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'cute', 'episodes', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Super', 'Secret', 'Super', 'Spy', 'Mighty', 'Knights', 'cute', 'typical', 'Backyardigans', 'full', 'price', 'half', 'hour', 'advertising', 'Debatable']",N/A

1314468,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002ZTLVVQ,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 8]","For any parent of young children within the last six years, ""The Backyardigans"" is probably a show that has been a big part of their children's daily viewing and early life.The Canadian 3-D CGI-animated children's TV series was created by Janice Burgess and began airing on CBS in 2004 through 2006 and then brought to Nickelodeon's various children's channels including Nick Jr. and continues to be a popular show for children.The series revolves around five young characters who live near each other.  And when they play outside with each other, their imaginative minds brings them to an adventure that they all play out.The main characters of ""The Backyardigans"" are:* Pablo - A blue and yellow penguin who has many ideas.  Energetic.* Tyrone - A red-haired orange moose and is Pablo's best friend.  Very laid-back.* Uniqua - A spunky, high spirited Uniqua who wears polka-dotted clothing.  The tomboy who can be a bit stubborn.* Tasha - A little yellow hippopotamus.  The serious one.* Austin - A young purple kangaroo who shows up from time-to-time to play with his friends.""The Backyardigans - Escape from the Tower"" includes three episodes on one DVD.  Included are:* ""BREAK OUT!"" - Princess Uniqua and Tasha use the Magic Mirror Austin and must escape from guards Pablo and Tyrone.* ""FOR THE LOVE OF SOCKS"" - The Backyardigans make socks at a factory but after an accident, the group must save the socks.* ""LOS GALACTICOS"" - The gang are in an intergalactic mission and the kids are a mariachi band known as Los Galacticos who were accidentally blasted off to space and encounter aliens Uniqua and Austin.VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Backyardigans - Escape from the Tower"" is presented in Fullscreen.  The CG animation is pretty good for a children's CG animated show.  Where many shows tend to focus more on the characters, ""The Backyardigans"" has pretty good looking CGI-animation for the characters and also the surrounding background scenes and whichever surroundings or vehicles the young adventurers occupy. I also like how certain objects and surroundings have textures (some shows skip the texturing and just focus on the shading and lighting).  Overall, ""The Backyardigans"" is a series that sports animation that children should definitely enjoy.As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and is front channel driven.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Backyardigans - Escape from the Tower"" comes with a bonus episode from ""The Fresh Beat Band"":* ""Rock the Luau"" - In this episode of ""The Fresh Beat Band"", Marina's hands and hips won't stop moving and is unable to focus on the drums during the luau practice.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Backyardigans"" is a series that my son pretty much grew up with and through his early toddler years, I watched many episodes with him.  What I enjoyed about the show is how it encourages teamwork and also to have an imagination while going on an adventure and the characters are having fun.The episodes are broadcast quite a bit on the various Nickelodeon channels, so I wouldn't be surprised if parents who purchase this DVD and their children know the songs by heart.The three episodes included on ""The Backyardigans - Escape from the Tower"" DVD are safe for children and would make a solid ideal purchase for parents looking for a DVD for their children, especially on commutes.  As for the bonus episode of ""The Fresh Beat Band"", the show features four teenagers who have a band and love singing and dancing.  The show is pretty safe and although the talent are not children, the episode is music driven and safe for children.Overall, if you are looking for a safe, enjoyable and fun DVD for your young children, ""The Backyardigans - Escape from the Tower"" would definitely be a good choice!",4,"Featuring three episodes plus a bonus episode of ""The Fresh Beat Band"".
