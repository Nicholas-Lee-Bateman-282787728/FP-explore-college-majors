1413074,A1B5ERBAC41VMT,B004LC2ZUG,Alice Caldwell,"[0, 0]","I love this DVD. It was worth the purchase. Here's a young man who has a failing company due to a much larger company trying to keep him down. I would have preferred that he told her from the beginning that there was a problem and needed to go somewhere quite to think and not continue the gay thing. Even though, he isn't the one who started it but he didn't stop it. It was fun watching how he got out of situations toward his own design that came from a gift. She actually sent him to the store for sanitary pads thinking he was gay and her inside (girlfriend) who wouldn't mind doing this for her especially where she was at the time. All in all, i love &#34;Personal Taste&#34; and watch it often even on Dramafever site, I can't get enough. You will enjoy it. The main thing is, don't allow a lie to continue even if you didn't start it but you can stop it.",5,Great!!!,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,863,"['love', 'DVD', 'was', 'worth', 'purchase', 'Here', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'failing', 'company', 'due', 'much', 'larger', 'company', 'trying', 'keep', 'down', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'told', 'beginning', 'was', 'problem', 'needed', 'go', 'somewhere', 'quite', 'think', 'not', 'continue', 'gay', 'thing', 'Even', ""n't"", 'one', 'who', 'started', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'how', 'got', 'situations', 'own', 'design', 'came', 'gift', 'actually', 'sent', 'store', 'sanitary', 'pads', 'thinking', 'was', 'gay', 'inside', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'doing', 'especially', 'where', 'was', 'time', 'i', 'love', '34', 'Personal', 'Taste', '34', 'watch', 'often', 'even', 'Dramafever', 'site', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'will', 'enjoy', 'main', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'lie', 'continue', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'can', 'stop']",Personal Taste

The supporting cast in this series are superb (his best friend/her best friend) are absolutely priceless in their moments.  I've always thought that being friends before being lovers is a VERY important aspect of any relationship & that is what brings this show to the front of my watching queue.  The sexual chemistry is most definitely there, but being friends allows the sweetness of the growing romance to come thru so beautifully.Buy and enjoy the next 16 hours of quality viewing!You will not go wrong with Lee Min Ho (Faith/City Hunter/I am Sam/Boys Over Flowers).",5,Game Over mida!,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,668,"['LOVE', 'series', ""'m"", 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'uber-fan', 'just', 'so', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'supporting', 'cast', 'series', 'are', 'superb', 'best', 'friend/her', 'best', 'friend', 'are', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'being', 'friends', 'being', 'lovers', 'VERY', 'important', 'aspect', 'relationship', 'what', 'show', 'front', 'watching', 'queue', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'most', 'definitely', 'there', 'being', 'friends', 'sweetness', 'growing', 'romance', 'come', 'thru', 'so', 'beautifully.Buy', 'enjoy', 'next', '16', 'hours', 'quality', 'viewing', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'Faith/City', 'Hunter/I', 'am', 'Sam/Boys', 'Over', 'Flowers']",Personal Taste

1413077,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B004LC2ZUG,Anne-Marie G,"[26, 27]","Note: This review is for the show and not this specific DVD setHow could I not watch this after being totally dazzled by Lee Min Ho inBoys Over Flowers - Korean Drama Complete Set (8 DVDs with English Subtitles)?I was afraid at first of not being able to see him as any other character but Jun Pyo, however watching him portray Jin Ho in this my fears were erased. It doesn't hurt that both characters have very different styles. (Clothes are almost always a good reason to watch any of these Korean dramas.) Jin Ho is very cool and modern, this fits his personality as he is very driven and focused entirely on his work as an up and coming architect.By contrast Kae In is a complete slob. She's obviously very sweet and trusting, but a bit of a disasterpiece when it comes to life.  If nothing else this drama is worth watching for the dramatic use of power tools. Kae In may be meek and mild but she knows how to wield a chain saw which results in my absolutely favorite scene from this whole drama.The plot really starts to roll after Kae In has found out in the worst way possible that her long term boyfriend is no longer interested in her: she goes to her roommate/best friend's wedding only to find out he is the groom. Ouch. Money is tight for Kae In, so she advertises for a roommate. Jin Ho has found out that the house Kae In lives in is key to winning the bid in his latest architectural project. And so he moves in, inadvertently giving the impression that he is gay (thus making it ok for her to have a single man living under the same roof as her).  It is pretty sweet how they develop a codependent friendship.  That is what really drives the romance for these two, their genuine friendship.There is a pretty full cast of secondary characters, some are far more endearing than others. There are two real scene stealers though, Do Bin, the benevolent Art Director who is in charge of the project that Jin Ho is working on.  He acts as a sort of father to Kae In once he gets to know her too, better than her own emotionally iced over father.  He has his own emotionally devastating secret that just makes him that much sadder to watch. He seriously goes around the show looking like a kicked puppy. Sang Joon is the other character who just sizzles in every scene he is in, he is entirely a comedic foil for the cool Jin Ho, but he just does wonders at pretending to be the gay boyfriend.This show is well worth watching for Lee Min Ho, for awesome powertools and some great secondary characters. I am not as in love with it as other shows and with time I have forgotten parts, it isn't ground breaking, but I really enjoyed it and feel no shame in admitting that I watched it. It is a solid show but it doesn't have me giddy with love for it, I haven't gone back and rewatched parts of it the way I have for other shows.",4,Solid Show,1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,2836,"['Note', 'review', 'show', 'not', 'specific', 'DVD', 'setHow', 'could', 'not', 'watch', 'being', 'totally', 'dazzled', 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'Flowers', 'Korean', 'Drama', 'Complete', 'Set', '8', 'DVDs', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'was', 'afraid', 'first', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'other', 'character', 'Jun', 'Pyo', 'however', 'watching', 'portray', 'Jin', 'Ho', 'fears', 'were', 'erased', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'characters', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'styles', 'Clothes', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'good', 'reason', 'watch', 'Korean', 'dramas', 'Jin', 'Ho', 'very', 'cool', 'modern', 'personality', 'very', 'driven', 'focused', 'entirely', 'work', 'up', 'coming', 'architect.By', 'contrast', 'Kae', 'complete', 'slob', 'obviously', 'very', 'sweet', 'trusting', 'bit', 'disasterpiece', 'when', 'life', 'nothing', 'else', 'drama', 'worth', 'watching', 'dramatic', 'use', 'power', 'tools', 'Kae', 'may', 'be', 'meek', 'mild', 'how', 'wield', 'chain', 'saw', 'results', 'absolutely', 'favorite', 'scene', 'whole', 'drama.The', 'plot', 'really', 'roll', 'Kae', 'found', 'out', 'worst', 'way', 'possible', 'long', 'term', 'boyfriend', 'no', 'longer', 'interested', 'roommate/best', 'friend', 'wedding', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'groom', 'Ouch', 'Money', 'tight', 'Kae', 'roommate', 'Jin', 'Ho', 'found', 'out', 'house', 'Kae', 'lives', 'key', 'winning', 'bid', 'latest', 'architectural', 'project', 'so', 'inadvertently', 'giving', 'impression', 'gay', 'thus', 'making', 'ok', 'have', 'single', 'man', 'living', 'same', 'roof', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'how', 'develop', 'codependent', 'friendship', 'what', 'really', 'romance', 'two', 'genuine', 'friendship.There', 'pretty', 'full', 'cast', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'endearing', 'others', 'are', 'two', 'real', 'scene', 'stealers', 'Do', 'Bin', 'benevolent', 'Art', 'Director', 'who', 'charge', 'project', 'Jin', 'Ho', 'working', 'sort', 'father', 'Kae', 'once', 'know', 'too', 'better', 'own', 'emotionally', 'iced', 'father', 'own', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'secret', 'just', 'much', 'sadder', 'watch', 'seriously', 'show', 'looking', 'kicked', 'puppy', 'Sang', 'Joon', 'other', 'character', 'who', 'just', 'sizzles', 'scene', 'entirely', 'comedic', 'foil', 'cool', 'Jin', 'Ho', 'just', 'wonders', 'pretending', 'be', 'gay', 'boyfriend.This', 'show', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'awesome', 'powertools', 'great', 'secondary', 'characters', 'am', 'not', 'love', 'other', 'shows', 'time', 'have', 'forgotten', 'parts', ""n't"", 'ground', 'breaking', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'feel', 'shame', 'admitting', 'watched', 'solid', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'giddy', 'love', 'have', ""n't"", 'gone', 'back', 'rewatched', 'parts', 'way', 'have', 'other', 'shows']",Personal Taste
