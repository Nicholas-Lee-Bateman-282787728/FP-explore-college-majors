390458,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6303934900,Andrew McCaffrey,"[5, 6]","(Please note that the DVD version I am reviewing is the Laserlight edition of THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE.  This budget release pretty much defines the concept of ""no-frills"".)Other reviewers have pointed out the fact that this movie skimps on plot and I cannot help but completely agree with that sentiment.  But for what the movie lacks in action, it more than makes up for in the presentation of fascinating characters.  Each person's story is interesting and unique.  And the movie manages to give us enough detail so that we can find these people intriguing, but leaves enough unsaid so that no one overstays their welcome.  We're left liking these people and wanting to hear more about them.Since the characters are at the forefront of this movie, it's certainly a relief to have such splendid actors playing them.  The Cagney siblings are wonderful.  Jeanne Cagney does a wonderful job at becoming the streetwise blonde who stands up to gangsters and James Cagney is a compelling, gentle enigma.  While so many of the roles could have easily fallen into stereotypes, the actors are strong enough to keep them as individuals.Although I haven't experienced the original play that this film is based upon, I can only imagine that there weren't too many script changes between the stage and the screen.  The movie is heavily performance-based, with the interesting material coming from the conversations and the soliloquies.  The action is completely centered on a single barroom, as during the entire length of the movie only one short sequence takes place outside the bar's swing doors.  Even a fight scene inside the same building occurs off-camera so that all we view are people in one room hollering at the unseen people in another.  As some characters leave the action, they are immediately replaced by other people beginning conversations of their own.  In fact, if you pay close attention, you'll probably notice that the amount of real time that people spend off-camera isn't nearly long enough to do all the things that they claim to have done in that span.Fortunately, none of this affects one's enjoyment of the film at all.  In fact, it gives the entire production a great sense of the theatrical nature of the performances.  Unlike some other translations from play to movie, this one never feels as though it's being limited by the theatre.  It retains the trappings and atmosphere of a stage production, while never feeling claustrophobic.  What makes for good theatre doesn't always make for a good film (and vice versa), yet it's a testament to the skills of the director and the cast that they manage to make the transition here without a hitch.The image quality on this Laserlight DVD is perfectly watchable.  It's scratchy in a few places, but never so much that it becomes distracting.  The picture is a bit bright and slightly washed out, but this is really only a problem in one scene where the audience is expected to read something that's a character has written on a piece of paper.  The sound quality is variable, but mostly falls on the good side of variable.  As the DVD itself is absolutely dirt cheap, it's well worth putting up with these slight imperfections.",4,James Cagney knows your name,1015459200,"03 7, 2002",2002,3190,"['Please', 'note', 'DVD', 'version', 'am', 'reviewing', 'Laserlight', 'edition', 'THE', 'TIME', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'budget', 'release', 'pretty', 'much', 'concept', 'no-frills', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'fact', 'movie', 'plot', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'completely', 'agree', 'sentiment', 'what', 'movie', 'action', 'more', 'up', 'presentation', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'person', 'story', 'interesting', 'unique', 'movie', 'give', 'enough', 'detail', 'can', 'find', 'people', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'unsaid', 'one', 'welcome', ""'re"", 'left', 'liking', 'people', 'wanting', 'hear', 'more', 'them.Since', 'characters', 'are', 'forefront', 'movie', 'certainly', 'relief', 'have', 'such', 'splendid', 'actors', 'playing', 'Cagney', 'siblings', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Jeanne', 'Cagney', 'wonderful', 'job', 'becoming', 'streetwise', 'blonde', 'who', 'up', 'gangsters', 'James', 'Cagney', 'compelling', 'gentle', 'enigma', 'so', 'many', 'roles', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'fallen', 'stereotypes', 'actors', 'are', 'strong', 'enough', 'keep', 'individuals.Although', 'have', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'original', 'play', 'film', 'based', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'script', 'changes', 'stage', 'screen', 'movie', 'heavily', 'performance-based', 'interesting', 'material', 'coming', 'conversations', 'soliloquies', 'action', 'completely', 'centered', 'single', 'barroom', 'entire', 'length', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'short', 'sequence', 'place', 'bar', 'swing', 'doors', 'Even', 'fight', 'scene', 'same', 'building', 'off-camera', 'view', 'are', 'people', 'one', 'room', 'hollering', 'unseen', 'people', 'characters', 'leave', 'action', 'are', 'immediately', 'replaced', 'other', 'people', 'beginning', 'conversations', 'own', 'fact', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'notice', 'amount', 'real', 'time', 'people', 'spend', 'off-camera', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'long', 'enough', 'do', 'things', 'claim', 'have', 'done', 'span.Fortunately', 'none', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'fact', 'entire', 'production', 'great', 'sense', 'theatrical', 'nature', 'performances', 'other', 'translations', 'play', 'movie', 'one', 'never', 'being', 'limited', 'theatre', 'trappings', 'atmosphere', 'stage', 'production', 'never', 'feeling', 'claustrophobic', 'What', 'good', 'theatre', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'vice', 'versa', 'testament', 'skills', 'director', 'cast', 'manage', 'make', 'transition', 'here', 'hitch.The', 'image', 'quality', 'Laserlight', 'DVD', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'scratchy', 'few', 'places', 'never', 'so', 'much', 'distracting', 'picture', 'bit', 'bright', 'slightly', 'washed', 'out', 'really', 'only', 'problem', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'audience', 'expected', 'read', 'something', 'character', 'written', 'piece', 'paper', 'sound', 'quality', 'variable', 'mostly', 'good', 'side', 'variable', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'dirt', 'cheap', 'well', 'worth', 'putting', 'up', 'slight', 'imperfections']",Time of Your Life VHS
390459,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6303934900,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 2]","All Editorial Review Product Descriptions for RCE's red box discs are a c&p; text that includes their ""100 greatest classic films of all time"" blurb. These mostly obscure works are hardly as advertised. Also, picture and sound quality depend on condition of unrestored source material. Good to fair is about average.THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE is an adaptation of William Saroyan's Pulitzer Prize winning 1939 dramedy that's set in a waterfront San Francisco saloon.Nick (Bendix) is the long-suffering owner/barkeep whose window sign, ""Come in and be yourself"" has drawn together a strange little group. Cagney's Joe (who observes people) amuses himself with the doings of those around him at Nick's watering hole. He loves champagne and indulging his own whims. Tom (Morris) is Joe's stooge and friend, Kitty Duvall (Jeanne C.) is a call girl on the run from Chicago, Knapp (Crawford) is a bewildered policeman, McCarthy (Bond), the blatherskite.The romantic angle is instant love that blossoms between Kitty and Tom, a union sanctioned and abetted by Joe. Lydon reprises that famous ""coming mother!"" Henry Aldrich voice as Dudley Raoul Bostwick, a young fellow trying to reach the uninterested Elsie by phone. When he gets a wrong number, Dudley foolishly invites the gal that answers to meet him at Nick's. Riano's Mary L. is much older and probably less attractive than Elsie; Dudley flat out ditches her when she shows up for their blind date.Draper is Harry (the natural-born tap dancing comedian). He tells ""funny stories"" that no one laughs at and accents them with tap moves. Harry's new political piece is pure interpretive dance. Nick doesn't see the value in this hoofer's art until a starving young man named Wesley (Beane) wanders in. After some nourishment from Nick's kitchen, Wesley sits at the piano and plays marvelously. Harry dances along and an ""act"" is born. Nick hires them both as workers and entertainers.Barton's Kit Carson (a cowboy also called Murphy) is a good-natured, bewhiskered tale-spewing barfly whose stories interest Joe so much he commits them to memory, then combines elements of each into one giant whopper that makes old Kit guffaw. Erdman is Willie (the pinball machine maniac) who after many spent nickels finally beats Nick's machine, which then puts on a July 4th-like fireworks show. Miller is a comic tippler who wanders into the bar occasionally. Nick immediately shows him the door almost every time.Young Rees is a newsboy who repeatedly sells Joe every paper he carries. His angelic soprano on ""When Irish Eyes Are Smiling"" is a highlight. Joe's tastes in music run mainly to selections #6 and #7 on the jukebox. The former, ""Wait 'Til the Sun Shines Nellie"" always gets him chiming in on a break. Finally, there's society slummers Schafer and Freeman. Their bemusement with a lower societal strata quickly ends when violence erupts, in the form of Powers as Freddy Blick (a stool pigeon and frame-up artist), who's out to get both Nick and Kitty. Good thing Joe's around to stop him!This unique filming of a play without a specific plotline is ideal for Joe's spiritual brethren, that is, interested observers of humanity. Highly recommended!Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.2) The Time of Your Life (1948) - Jimmy Cagney/Bill Bendix/Wayne Morris/Jeanne Cagney/Broderick Crawford/Ward Bond/James Barton/Paul Draper/Gale Page/Jimmy Lydon/Richard Erdman/Pedro de Cordoba/Reginald Beane/John 'Skins' Miller/Tom Powers/Natalie Schafer/Howard Freeman/Renie Riano/Lanny Rees",4,"""In the time of your life, live!""",1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,3559,"['Editorial', 'Review', 'Product', 'Descriptions', 'RCE', 'red', 'box', 'discs', 'are', 'c', 'p', '100', 'greatest', 'classic', 'films', 'time', 'blurb', 'mostly', 'obscure', 'works', 'are', 'hardly', 'advertised', 'Also', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'depend', 'condition', 'unrestored', 'source', 'material', 'Good', 'fair', 'average.THE', 'TIME', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'adaptation', 'William', 'Saroyan', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', '1939', 'dramedy', 'set', 'waterfront', 'San', 'Francisco', 'saloon.Nick', 'Bendix', 'long-suffering', 'owner/barkeep', 'window', 'sign', 'Come', 'be', 'drawn', 'together', 'strange', 'little', 'group', 'Cagney', 'Joe', 'who', 'people', 'doings', 'Nick', 'watering', 'hole', 'champagne', 'indulging', 'own', 'whims', 'Tom', 'Morris', 'Joe', 'stooge', 'friend', 'Kitty', 'Duvall', 'Jeanne', 'C.', 'call', 'girl', 'run', 'Chicago', 'Knapp', 'Crawford', 'bewildered', 'policeman', 'McCarthy', 'Bond', 'blatherskite.The', 'romantic', 'angle', 'instant', 'love', 'Kitty', 'Tom', 'union', 'sanctioned', 'abetted', 'Joe', 'Lydon', 'famous', 'coming', 'mother', 'Henry', 'Aldrich', 'voice', 'Dudley', 'Raoul', 'Bostwick', 'young', 'fellow', 'trying', 'reach', 'uninterested', 'Elsie', 'phone', 'When', 'wrong', 'number', 'Dudley', 'foolishly', 'gal', 'meet', 'Nick', 'Riano', 'Mary', 'L.', 'much', 'older', 'probably', 'less', 'attractive', 'Elsie', 'Dudley', 'out', 'ditches', 'when', 'up', 'blind', 'date.Draper', 'Harry', 'natural-born', 'tap', 'dancing', 'comedian', 'funny', 'stories', 'one', 'accents', 'tap', 'moves', 'Harry', 'new', 'political', 'piece', 'pure', 'interpretive', 'dance', 'Nick', ""n't"", 'see', 'value', 'hoofer', 'art', 'starving', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Wesley', 'Beane', 'wanders', 'nourishment', 'Nick', 'kitchen', 'Wesley', 'piano', 'marvelously', 'Harry', 'along', 'act', 'born', 'Nick', 'workers', 'entertainers.Barton', 'Kit', 'Carson', 'cowboy', 'also', 'called', 'Murphy', 'good-natured', 'bewhiskered', 'tale-spewing', 'barfly', 'stories', 'interest', 'Joe', 'so', 'much', 'memory', 'then', 'elements', 'one', 'giant', 'whopper', 'old', 'Kit', 'guffaw', 'Erdman', 'Willie', 'pinball', 'machine', 'maniac', 'who', 'many', 'spent', 'nickels', 'finally', 'Nick', 'machine', 'then', 'July', '4th-like', 'fireworks', 'show', 'Miller', 'comic', 'tippler', 'who', 'bar', 'occasionally', 'Nick', 'immediately', 'door', 'almost', 'time.Young', 'Rees', 'newsboy', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'Joe', 'paper', 'angelic', 'soprano', 'When', 'Irish', 'Eyes', 'Are', 'Smiling', 'highlight', 'Joe', 'tastes', 'music', 'run', 'mainly', 'selections', '6', '7', 'jukebox', 'former', 'Wait', ""'Til"", 'Sun', 'Shines', 'Nellie', 'always', 'chiming', 'break', 'Finally', 'society', 'slummers', 'Schafer', 'Freeman', 'bemusement', 'lower', 'societal', 'strata', 'quickly', 'when', 'violence', 'erupts', 'form', 'Powers', 'Freddy', 'Blick', 'stool', 'pigeon', 'frame-up', 'artist', 'who', 'out', 'get', 'Nick', 'Kitty', 'Good', 'thing', 'Joe', 'stop', 'unique', 'filming', 'play', 'specific', 'plotline', 'ideal', 'Joe', 'spiritual', 'brethren', 'interested', 'observers', 'humanity', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.2', 'Time', 'Your', 'Life', '1948', 'Jimmy', 'Cagney/Bill', 'Bendix/Wayne', 'Morris/Jeanne', 'Cagney/Broderick', 'Crawford/Ward', 'Bond/James', 'Barton/Paul', 'Draper/Gale', 'Page/Jimmy', 'Lydon/Richard', 'Erdman/Pedro', 'de', 'Cordoba/Reginald', 'Beane/John', 'Miller/Tom', 'Powers/Natalie', 'Schafer/Howard', 'Freeman/Renie', 'Riano/Lanny', 'Rees']",Time of Your Life VHS

390465,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6303934900,Randy Keehn,"[1, 3]","I suspect many an aspiring writer has spent too much time in a bar looking for artistic inspiration.  I get this inpression from all of the ""dramas"" that take place in taverns.  Some, like ""The Iceman Cometh"", are topnotch.  Others, like ""The Time of Your Life"", come across mediocre at best.  In the case of the latter, I found myself wondering what the point was.  We are expected to believe that interesting, intelligent people congregate for innocent fun and frolic.  Maybe it does seem like a pleasant place to many but I found myself wondering why there were more employees than customers, why there was a full-time cook when I only saw one person eat while there, why the script was so lame.  This was obviously a theatrical play brought to the screen.  It may have worked better on stage the way the script moves the spotlight from one charater to another.  However, on film I felt this gave the movie a lack of perspective.  Most of the vignettes were pretty bland.  The humor failed to make me smile, the drama failed to touch me and the suspense bored me.  It seemed that there was always the potential to amuse, entertain, or intrigue but the script just wasn't up to the task.I made it a point to watch ""The Time of Your Life"" because I noted that James Cagny was the star.  I like his acting style and ability (when given at least a reasonable vehicle to preform in).  It actually was a sort of family affair with his brother William as the producer and his sister Jeanne as the leading lady.  Cagny was decent enough but his role, as well, lacked substance.  The movie was from a play by William Saroyan.  Saroyan no doubt observed many interesting things from his experiences in taverns.

390467,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6303934900,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 5]","THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE was based upon William Saroyan's Pulitzer Prize-winning play and was brought about, in part, by a collaboration of the Cagney siblings (James, Jeanne, and William). Except for one brief shot of the Salvation Army singing outside the establishment, the entire movie takes place inside Nick's, a saloon, restaurant, and entertainment palace on the waterfront in San Francisco. James Cagney plays Joe, a man who has a lot of cash and spends his time observing, listening, and helping people and fulfilling his every whim. Wayne Morris plays Tom, Joe's gopher man; Jeanne Cagney plays  Kitty, a former ""burlesque queen"" who falls for Tom; and William Bendix plays Nick. The floating characters at Nick's also include, among others, a lovesick young man, an out of work fellow, a drunk, a cowboy who calls himself ""Kit Carson"", a pinball wizard, a dancer who is a comedian that has no funny jokes, a police officer, and a couple of socialites.There really isn't much plot in THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE. However, neither the movie nor the play it was based upon are about ""plot"". There may not seem to be a lot going on, but actually there is. The plot of the story is it's characters. Each person that comes into Nick's has a story and some of them we learn, some of them we don't. However, while listening to each person (just as Joe does) we learn something about them and in the process we discover things about ourselves. THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE is art in it's highest form because it entertains, yet also enlightens.The quality of this DVD isn't all that bad, especially considering how inexpensive it is to purchase a copy (the Laserlight edition can be purchased for less than $5). The sound is good through most of the film except for the occasional scratch and the picture is great (the one scene where you can't read what is on the piece of paper was filmed that way intentionally because you are not supposed to see what's written on the paper because it's too small).Overall a good movie well worth the time to watch it.",4,Come in and Be Yourself.,1031356800,"09 7, 2002",2002,2042,"['TIME', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'was', 'based', 'William', 'Saroyan', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'play', 'was', 'brought', 'about', 'part', 'collaboration', 'Cagney', 'siblings', 'James', 'Jeanne', 'William', 'one', 'brief', 'shot', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'singing', 'establishment', 'entire', 'movie', 'place', 'Nick', 'saloon', 'restaurant', 'entertainment', 'palace', 'waterfront', 'San', 'Francisco', 'James', 'Cagney', 'Joe', 'man', 'who', 'lot', 'cash', 'time', 'observing', 'listening', 'helping', 'people', 'fulfilling', 'whim', 'Wayne', 'Morris', 'Tom', 'Joe', 'gopher', 'man', 'Jeanne', 'Cagney', 'Kitty', 'former', 'burlesque', 'queen', 'who', 'Tom', 'William', 'Bendix', 'Nick', 'floating', 'characters', 'Nick', 'also', 'include', 'others', 'lovesick', 'young', 'man', 'out', 'work', 'fellow', 'drunk', 'cowboy', 'who', 'Kit', 'Carson', 'pinball', 'wizard', 'dancer', 'who', 'comedian', 'funny', 'jokes', 'police', 'officer', 'couple', 'socialites.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'THE', 'TIME', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'However', 'movie', 'play', 'was', 'based', 'are', 'plot', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'lot', 'going', 'actually', 'plot', 'story', 'characters', 'person', 'Nick', 'story', 'learn', 'do', ""n't"", 'However', 'listening', 'person', 'just', 'Joe', 'learn', 'something', 'process', 'discover', 'things', 'TIME', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'art', 'highest', 'form', 'yet', 'also', 'enlightens.The', 'quality', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'bad', 'especially', 'considering', 'how', 'inexpensive', 'purchase', 'copy', 'Laserlight', 'edition', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', 'less', '5', 'sound', 'good', 'most', 'film', 'occasional', 'scratch', 'picture', 'great', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'what', 'piece', 'paper', 'was', 'filmed', 'way', 'intentionally', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'see', 'what', 'written', 'paper', 'too', 'small', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'time', 'watch']",Time of Your Life VHS
