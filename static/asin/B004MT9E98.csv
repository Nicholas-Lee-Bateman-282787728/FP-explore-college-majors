I didn't know any of this, I found her on the Internet and chose her because she was pretty.  Lol.  I've had big dogs all my life and this was a situation where I was starting fresh with a new dog and didn't have any other dogs to &#34;show them the ropes&#34; (rare) and wanted to brush up on my &#34;training&#34; when I came across Cesar's DVD's.  Instead of just training her (which I also did), I like to say I &#34;Cesar'd&#34; her ;)...I started from the moment my husband walked in the door with her (I didn't greet her, I sat on the floor and let her come to me) and she is my favorite dog ever.  She's now 135 pounds of beautifully behaved teddy bear, but this dog would also protect me with her life.  Everyone loves her, the vet raves over how well-behaved she is, and I know it's because of the Cesar stuff.  I watched every DVD on Netflix when she was a puppy and applied where needed.  Too bad I didn't start off with my daughter's tiny dog the same way...he's still a work in progress.",5,Love Cesar!,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,1355,"['am', 'big', 'Cesar', 'Milan', 'fan', 'tried', 'techniques', 'new', 'dog', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'had', 'zero', 'issues', 'had', 'potential', 'be', '34', 'bad', 'dog', '34', 'ended', 'up', 'shelter', 'wrong', 'hands', 'huge', 'Mastiff-Boxer-', 'mix', 'VERY', 'stubborn', 'high', 'energy', 'dominant', 'destructive', 'easily-irritated', 'quick', 'snap', 'young', 'dog', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'found', 'Internet', 'chose', 'was', 'pretty', 'Lol', ""'ve"", 'had', 'big', 'dogs', 'life', 'was', 'situation', 'where', 'was', 'starting', 'fresh', 'new', 'dog', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'dogs', '34', 'show', 'ropes', '34', 'rare', 'wanted', 'brush', 'up', '34', 'training', '34', 'when', 'came', 'Cesar', 'DVD', 'Instead', 'just', 'training', 'also', 'did', 'like', 'say', '34', 'Cesar', ""'d"", '34', 'started', 'moment', 'husband', 'walked', 'door', 'did', ""n't"", 'greet', 'sat', 'floor', 'let', 'come', 'favorite', 'dog', 'ever', 'now', '135', 'pounds', 'beautifully', 'behaved', 'teddy', 'bear', 'dog', 'would', 'also', 'protect', 'life', 'Everyone', 'vet', 'how', 'well-behaved', 'know', 'Cesar', 'stuff', 'watched', 'DVD', 'Netflix', 'when', 'was', 'puppy', 'applied', 'where', 'needed', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'off', 'daughter', 'tiny', 'dog', 'same', 'way', 'still', 'work', 'progress']",N/A

There are often at least eight dogs at my home for family gatherings and they all get along beautifully. The largest is a Bernese Mountain dog and the smallest is a 4 lb, 3-legged chihuahua.

1420294,A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,B004MT9E98,J. Chambers,"[9, 9]","My wife and I have been Cesar Millan fans for several years, even though we don't have any dogs. For us, his TV shows on NatGeo and his books were enjoyable, but without any dogs, we had no chance to try out his methods. That all changed last year when our two young nieces got mixed-breed puppies for Christmas. After only a few months, it was apparent that the dogs-sisters from the same litter-were going to be big, really big. The dogs were gentle, but with their size and exuberance, they were creating havoc and were knocking down kids and even adults. We took on the challenge and worked with them, using Cesar's techniques. It took a good bit of repetition, but after a while, we had two well-behaved, calm and submissive dogs. I am aware that some have criticized Cesar Millan's methods, but after seeing the results firsthand, I'm convinced that his methods work, at least for most dogs, with some patience and determination.""Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan: Season 5"" is a nice, representative collection of ""Dog Whisperer"" shows. The set includes three DVDs with fourteen episodes, with a total run time of 686 minutes (note: the Amazon product description shows 735 minutes - I think the higher number includes the two bonus features on the DVDs). Season 5 was aired in 2008-2009, with 23 episodes. This set includes episodes 1-14. The product description really should have stated that this set is volume 1, as they've done with other seasons. As the product is now labeled, it is a little deceiving, but getting fourteen episodes plus the bonus features is a great value for the price, so I'm not complaining.If you're serious about using Cesar's methods on your own dogs, I recommend getting one or two of the DVDs and one or two of Cesar's books, where you can get into his approach to changing dog behavior in more depth.",5,Cesar's methods worked for us,1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,1839,"['wife', 'have', 'been', 'Cesar', 'Millan', 'fans', 'several', 'years', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dogs', 'TV', 'shows', 'NatGeo', 'books', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'dogs', 'had', 'chance', 'try', 'out', 'methods', 'changed', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'two', 'young', 'nieces', 'got', 'mixed-breed', 'puppies', 'Christmas', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'was', 'apparent', 'dogs-sisters', 'same', 'litter-were', 'going', 'be', 'big', 'really', 'big', 'dogs', 'were', 'gentle', 'size', 'exuberance', 'were', 'creating', 'havoc', 'were', 'knocking', 'down', 'kids', 'even', 'adults', 'took', 'challenge', 'worked', 'using', 'Cesar', 'techniques', 'took', 'good', 'bit', 'repetition', 'while', 'had', 'two', 'well-behaved', 'calm', 'submissive', 'dogs', 'am', 'aware', 'have', 'criticized', 'Cesar', 'Millan', 'methods', 'seeing', 'results', 'firsthand', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'methods', 'work', 'least', 'most', 'dogs', 'patience', 'determination', 'Dog', 'Whisperer', 'Cesar', 'Millan', 'Season', '5', 'nice', 'representative', 'collection', 'Dog', 'Whisperer', 'set', 'three', 'DVDs', 'fourteen', 'episodes', 'total', 'run', 'time', '686', 'minutes', 'note', 'Amazon', 'product', 'description', '735', 'minutes', 'think', 'higher', 'number', 'two', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVDs', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'aired', '2008-2009', '23', 'episodes', 'set', '1-14', 'product', 'description', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'stated', 'set', 'volume', '1', ""'ve"", 'done', 'other', 'seasons', 'product', 'now', 'labeled', 'little', 'deceiving', 'getting', 'fourteen', 'episodes', 'bonus', 'great', 'value', 'price', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining.If', ""'re"", 'serious', 'using', 'Cesar', 'methods', 'own', 'dogs', 'recommend', 'getting', 'one', 'two', 'DVDs', 'one', 'two', 'Cesar', 'books', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'approach', 'changing', 'dog', 'behavior', 'more', 'depth']",N/A
