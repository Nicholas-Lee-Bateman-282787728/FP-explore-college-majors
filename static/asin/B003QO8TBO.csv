Petty,"[2, 2]","This review may be a bit of a spoiler but since it takes half the movie to find out what's going on it may help those with less patience than I have.A woman who owns a restaurant and her husband the architect buy an abandoned brothel to turn into a bed and breakfast, but the husband commits suicide in the bath.  The wife enters the bath just as Death who she refers to as ""Thief"" is leaving.  She seduces Death in the hopes of regaining her husband.  She fails.Unable to deal with being Death's mistress she flees to the brothel,  and tries to rebuild her life.  Upon finding a locked chest in the attic she opens it and awakens the ghosts of the brothel.  The experiences she had with Death allow her to interact with the ghosts of the Brothel, who are a diverse group with whom she feels a bond.  Through the ghosts help she learns lessons about herself, her dreams,  and her life.Death pursues her to the Brothel where he tries to reclaim her, but in the end he releases her and helps her to come to terms with her husbands death.This movie starts a bit slowly and is a bit confusing until about halfway through, but the plot resolves solidly.  The movie is filled with images and symbolism that allow the viewers hints as to what is really going on as well. The acting is superb all around and the characters do a wonderful job drawing you into the story.Warning-There are several sexual situations as well as nudity, but the movie is named Brothel...so what did you expect :)",4,A modern ghost tale with a marvelous story line 4 1/2 stars.,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,1482,"['review', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'spoiler', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'may', 'help', 'less', 'patience', 'have.A', 'woman', 'who', 'restaurant', 'husband', 'architect', 'buy', 'abandoned', 'brothel', 'turn', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'husband', 'commits', 'suicide', 'bath', 'wife', 'bath', 'just', 'Death', 'who', 'Thief', 'leaving', 'Death', 'hopes', 'regaining', 'husband', 'fails.Unable', 'deal', 'being', 'Death', 'mistress', 'brothel', 'tries', 'rebuild', 'life', 'finding', 'locked', 'chest', 'attic', 'ghosts', 'brothel', 'experiences', 'had', 'Death', 'allow', 'interact', 'ghosts', 'Brothel', 'who', 'are', 'diverse', 'group', 'whom', 'bond', 'ghosts', 'help', 'lessons', 'herself', 'dreams', 'life.Death', 'Brothel', 'where', 'reclaim', 'end', 'come', 'terms', 'husbands', 'death.This', 'movie', 'bit', 'slowly', 'bit', 'confusing', 'halfway', 'plot', 'solidly', 'movie', 'filled', 'images', 'symbolism', 'allow', 'viewers', 'hints', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'superb', 'around', 'characters', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'drawing', 'story.Warning-There', 'are', 'several', 'sexual', 'situations', 'as', 'well', 'nudity', 'movie', 'named', 'Brothel', 'so', 'what', 'did', 'expect']",N/A
1359018,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003QO8TBO,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The Brothel (Amy Waddell, 2008)There is really no tactful way to say this, so: Brothel (which may or may not have a The in front of it depending on which website you look at) is an unforgivably bad film, a Hallmark Original Movie with added profanity and nudity, but with the same new-age-inspirational-claptrap feel to it that gets the panties of the Hallmark Channel execs wet every time they encounter it in a bad DTV movie. I expect, if they can find a way to excise the things from it you can't show on TV, you'll be able to see it there relatively soon.Plot: For reasons unknown to you at the beginning of the film (they are part of the great mystery of the thing), Julianne (Serena Scott Thomas, younger sister of Kristin) is interested in getting away from her previous life as a wedding/party planner, buying an old brothel in Jerone, Arizona, and turning it into a bed and breakfast. She soon finds that the place is haunted by the ghosts of its last madam (The People Under the Stairs' Grace Zabriskie) and some of her girls, leading to long sequences of tearful dialogue as everyone works through their problems, ghost and human alike.There's a minor romance subplot, some thriller stuff, but in general, indistinguishable from your typical Hall-Time Original Production, right down to having the relatives of more famous actors hanging around (Whip Hubley, Season's younger brother, pops up as well). And all of it probably could have been done correctly, or at least half-decently, if Waddell (turning in her first, and as of this writing last, feature) had been able to decide what kind of movie she wanted to make. Is it a Life-Mark Original or an erotic thriller? A ghost story or a romance? A drama or a horror film? We have any number of examples of movies that crossed over well, but when it comes to making over a room, there's a way to mix Louis XIV and Roy Eames and make it look right, and a thousand ways to do it wrong. Amy Waddell, unfortunately, found herself with the latter.

Well, that's what I was thinking while watching BROTHEL, a movie filled with 3 to 4-second shots that may or may not mean anything to the story.For example, in the opening shots, a very sexy Serena Scott Thomas is busy at her restaurant when her husband/boyfriend/lover stops by for a quickie in her office.  She finds him dead just afterward but as the film progresses, you have no idea if he killed himself, a ghost seduced him to death, or if Serena had sex with him until he died.  The film presents all three scenarios over and over...and that's just those two characters.Deep into the film, you literally have no idea what's going on.  Since the style of the film was so chaotic with crazy cuts and otherworldly voice overs and bizarre images, you have no idea what reality existed in the story in the first place as it veers into artsy and surreal fantasies.  Was anything ever real?  Does anything matter?The ladies in the film are all excellent but it was trying to see them in snippets the whole time.  The location of Jerome, Arizona is visually stunning but also felt short-changed.  A wonderful ghost story could've been made of these ladies and the location...unfortunately, this wasn't it.",2,The World's Longest Calvin Klein Commercial,1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,1399,"['Remember', 'black', 'white', 'Calvin', 'Klein', 'fragrance', 'commercials', 'where', 'beautiful', 'bland', 'people', 'read', 'pretentious', 'lines', 'drama', 'never', 'understand', '30', 'seconds', 'order', 'sell', 'cologne', 'Well', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'watching', 'BROTHEL', 'movie', 'filled', '3', '4-second', 'shots', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'mean', 'anything', 'story.For', 'example', 'opening', 'shots', 'very', 'sexy', 'Serena', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'busy', 'restaurant', 'when', 'husband/boyfriend/lover', 'stops', 'quickie', 'office', 'dead', 'just', 'afterward', 'film', 'have', 'idea', 'killed', 'ghost', 'seduced', 'death', 'Serena', 'had', 'sex', 'died', 'film', 'three', 'scenarios', 'just', 'two', 'characters.Deep', 'film', 'literally', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'style', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'chaotic', 'crazy', 'cuts', 'otherworldly', 'voice', 'overs', 'bizarre', 'images', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'reality', 'existed', 'story', 'first', 'place', 'artsy', 'surreal', 'fantasies', 'Was', 'anything', 'ever', 'real', 'anything', 'matter', 'ladies', 'film', 'are', 'excellent', 'was', 'trying', 'see', 'snippets', 'whole', 'time', 'location', 'Jerome', 'Arizona', 'visually', 'stunning', 'also', 'felt', 'short-changed', 'wonderful', 'ghost', 'story', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'made', 'ladies', 'location', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't""]",N/A
