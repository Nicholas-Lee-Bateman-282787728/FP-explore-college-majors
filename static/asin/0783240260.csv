68472,A1LBIZLET9CW1I,0783240260,A fellow with a keyboard,"[4, 4]","If you watch this film thinking that it is about capital punishment or Holocaust denial, then you will have missed it. The film is not even about Leuchter. In Errol Morris's own words, it's about the exploration of a man almost completely lacking in self-knowledge.You can see through his subtle use of language -- ""accommodate the executee,"" ""make it more comfortable,"" ""dignified execution"" -- that Leuchter has convinced himself he's a good person doing a good deed. But you can also hear in his contradictions and see in his home photos -- posing with his electric chair like an amusement park attraction -- that his intentions are less than pure.* ""20% mark-up, which is very reasonable""* ""It's distasteful. The body is oozing so the guards have to get the bodily fluids on their hands."" (He pronounces ""guards"" like ""gods,"" by the way.)* ""Beautiful!,"" he says in response to chiseling a sample off of an Auschwitz gas chamber wall.The most stomach-churning moment comes just a few seconds shy of the hour mark, when Leuchter, escaping with his Auschwitz samples, says, ""I was never so relieved when we passed through the West German Passport Control because at least I hadn't chiseled at any of the West Germans' national shrines.""And then there's that goofy grin.If you're paying attention to these things, then this film will unmask the friendly face of evil. This is not an evil that means to harm people; it is an evil that is so absorbed in self and so lacking in self-knowledge that it can through psychological gymnastics convince itself that it is in fact good.Through this film, you can understand how Nazism can happen -- how it can happen to me and to you -- and how most of the world's evils, from Nazism to the trivial, everyday acts, are essentially Leuchter-esque.---There was a secondary lesson in this film, one that I hold just as dear. Leuchter was determined to ""prove"" that the gas chambers were not real by having samples chemically analyzed. The science was flawed, but the more serious error was that he wasn't looking at the right evidence: the photos, the films, the stories, the images.The most important truths - maybe even the most accurate ones - come not from laboratory results but from images. From films like this.---P.S. - Errol Morris has a 3.5-minute film that reminds me very much of this one. You can look it up on YouTube. It's called ""Donald Trump on Citizen Cane.""",5,My stomach sinks when I think about how good this movie is,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,2412,"['watch', 'film', 'thinking', 'capital', 'punishment', 'Holocaust', 'denial', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'missed', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'Leuchter', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'own', 'words', 'exploration', 'man', 'almost', 'completely', 'lacking', 'self-knowledge.You', 'can', 'see', 'subtle', 'use', 'language', 'accommodate', 'executee', 'make', 'more', 'comfortable', 'dignified', 'execution', 'Leuchter', 'convinced', 'good', 'person', 'doing', 'good', 'deed', 'can', 'also', 'hear', 'contradictions', 'see', 'home', 'photos', 'posing', 'electric', 'chair', 'amusement', 'park', 'attraction', 'intentions', 'are', 'less', 'pure', '*', '20', '%', 'mark-up', 'very', 'reasonable', 'distasteful', 'body', 'oozing', 'so', 'guards', 'have', 'get', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'hands', 'guards', 'gods', 'way', 'Beautiful', 'response', 'chiseling', 'sample', 'Auschwitz', 'gas', 'chamber', 'most', 'stomach-churning', 'moment', 'just', 'few', 'seconds', 'shy', 'hour', 'mark', 'when', 'Leuchter', 'escaping', 'Auschwitz', 'samples', 'was', 'never', 'so', 'relieved', 'when', 'passed', 'West', 'German', 'Passport', 'Control', 'least', 'had', ""n't"", 'chiseled', 'West', 'Germans', 'national', 'shrines', 'then', 'goofy', 'grin.If', ""'re"", 'paying', 'attention', 'things', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'unmask', 'friendly', 'face', 'evil', 'not', 'evil', 'harm', 'people', 'evil', 'so', 'absorbed', 'self', 'so', 'lacking', 'self-knowledge', 'can', 'psychological', 'gymnastics', 'convince', 'fact', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'Nazism', 'can', 'happen', 'how', 'can', 'happen', 'how', 'most', 'world', 'evils', 'Nazism', 'trivial', 'everyday', 'acts', 'are', 'essentially', 'Leuchter-esque.', 'was', 'secondary', 'lesson', 'film', 'one', 'hold', 'just', 'dear', 'Leuchter', 'was', 'determined', 'prove', 'gas', 'chambers', 'were', 'not', 'real', 'having', 'samples', 'chemically', 'analyzed', 'science', 'was', 'flawed', 'more', 'serious', 'error', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'right', 'evidence', 'photos', 'films', 'stories', 'images.The', 'most', 'important', 'truths', 'maybe', 'even', 'most', 'accurate', 'ones', 'come', 'not', 'laboratory', 'results', 'images', 'films', 'this.', '-P.S', 'Errol', 'Morris', '3.5-minute', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'look', 'up', 'YouTube', 'called', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'Citizen', 'Cane']",N/A

Fred Leuchter is a slippery guy. He's a self styled engineer in an industry consisting almost solely of himself: consulting prisons on instruments of execution. Leuchter himself is not even sure how he got there. &quot;I built helmets for electric chairs, so now I could build lethal injection machines,&quot; he says. &quot;I now build lethal injection machines, so now I'm competent to build a gallows. And since I'm building gallows, I'm also competent to work on gas chambers, because I've done all the other three.&quot; He almost laments that he's been shoe horned into an area that few others would be willing to go, but he does so anyway. He clearly enjoys his line of work and comes to see himself as a real expert. This belief in his own propaganda would be his downfall.He's a proponent of the death penalty but has a strong conviction that it should be handled &quot;humanely.&quot; Those awaiting execution, after decades of imprisonment, are &quot;just like you and me&quot; he argues. He would like to see lethal injection performed in molded seats like a dentist's office has. The condemned could watch TV, listen to music or look at pictures on the wall. Furthermore, execution could be a safe and painless process for the executioners as well. &quot;Nobody should have to place his life in jeopardy because an execution is being conducted.&quot; And the beguiling thing about Leuchter is that he is absolutely sincere. He is completely without guile. He clearly wants us to like him.Errol Morris tends toward the fringes in his selection of subject matter, but he rarely goes wrong. He invented a camera he calls the Interrotron that uses mirrors to show his own face directly over the camera lens. Using this and a prodigious skill as an interviewer, he manages to coax out the very essence of his subjects - often without even them realizing it. Go rent The Thin Blue Line and you'll see what I mean. Leuchter was initially going to be part of his last project, Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control, but Morris knows a good thing when he sees it and decided to make a new film entirely about Leuchter. And his strange occupation and views on capital punishment would have made a good subject alone. But Fred doesn't end there.In 1988, Ernst Zundel was on trial under an obscure Canadian law for &quot;publishing information he knew to be untrue.&quot; He published books claiming the Holocaust never happened. He called on Leuchter as the only man supposedly familiar enough with the instruments of execution to verify whether Auschwitz' infamous gas chambers really existed. Leuchter was flown to Auschwitz where he stole some brick and concrete samples and had them tested for cyanide. None was found. This gave rise to The Leuchter Report - a now famous document among neo-Nazi groups that supposedly offers evidence that the Holocaust deniers are correct.Now it would be very easy to paint Leuchter as a simple dupe, but Morris recognizes that he is as much a victim of himself as of the hate groups that he travels around speaking to. In the end, he pays dearly for his botched investigation and his hubris (and is still paying today). Leuchter, believing he was the savior of a wrongly accused man and &quot;the only expert in the world&quot; who could uncover the truth, clings to the knowledge that he was correct, despite all the evidence to the contrary and even his own admitted ineptitude at the sort of investigation he tried to do. The technician who actually performed the tests even confirms that Leuchter was wrong in his assumptions. But Leuchter is a believer.Morris has given us a masterful film and a look at a man who is anything but simple, but wrapped in a very simple package. He doesn't provide us with ready made answers for the quandaries that exist within Fred Leuchter, but shows him to us in three dimensions.

This film directly proceeded the McNamera classic but much of his skill at the genre is on display. The interplay of music and camera, and the way in which he captures onscreen the unsuspecting and pathetic Fred Leuchter is artful-this is true even the close-ups of coffee pots and electrical currents emanating from his head during the opening.That viewers feel sympathy for this confused, broken man who is devoid of social skills and social comprehension is an unintended consequence of the vehemence in which the forces of political correctness attacked him. He definitely had no idea as to the way he would be vilified simply by appearing at the Zundel trial. Leuchter, an engineer in deed only, with no scientific academic background whatsoever, conducted a middle school like science experiment at Birchenau and believed, based on some shoddy chemical analysis, that no cyanide gas was used there. The result was that his life was ruined.Personally, as a life long learner who has never been, and will never be, a historical revisionist, the destruction of Fred Leuchter is appalling. I completely believe and know that the holocaust occurred, but am aghast that certain ""activists"" think they have the right to destroy of the lives of those who disagree with them. Why didn't these brave activists respond to his arguments rather than conduct a campaign of hate? His positions are juvenile. Leuchter knew nothing about chemical tests, history, or society in general. He was an easy mark, but their emotionalizing the issue had the reverse effect. It made people think they had no answers to his arguments. It legitimizes revisionism. By squashing this non-entity they made him a martyr. What they should have done was publish vigorous refutations, instead they made Leuchter appear a champion of free inquiry; which, by the way, he is in comparison to shrieking critics and the Canadian government. This is the way in which political correctness and reckless emotion have damaged our intellects and degraded our culture. Bullying, shaming, and forcing guilt upon others is exactly how you vile personas like Ernst Zundel were created in the first place.

He is asked to support the defense team's contention that, perhaps, the Holocaust really didn't happen (and therefore their client is innocent of Holocaust denial).  Fred ends up taking a trip to Germany to determine if the alleged gas chambers ever had gas in them (by sampling the brick structures left standing).Obviously not qualified to make such a determination (due to lack of knowledge about the structures themselves, nor the technique of chemically testing sample materials), Fred comes to the (false) conclusion that mass murder must not have ocurred and that the Holocaust did not take place.  From here, his career as an execution consultant in the states goes down in flames, as people decide not to seek his services due ot his controversial contribution to the highly-publicized case.The film would be funny if it weren't for the serious subject matter.

Some viewers will find this work offensive, especially with Dr. Death's assertion that the Holocaust never took place. However, Morris's interest in this man is precisely because he doesn't fit into any neat categories. Fred Leuchter is a man who is pro capital punishment. He also designed more humane &quot;execution systems&quot; for various states.  In this role, he was a strange enough little man.  However, his taking on Auschwitz to determine if deaths really occurred there even more clearly defines him as a character.  He tackles death by execution with total aplomb and naivet&eacute;.

68478,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,0783240260,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[9, 16]","I have an overwhelming admiration for filmmaker, Errol Morris.  Adulation may even be a more accurate descriptive term---and I rarely  give  out such abundant praise to anyone.  Morris has probably dug himself into a  financial hole to present us with his masterpieces. The self  sacrifices of  this great American artist should shame us.  Our egalitarian, lowest common  denominator culture often rewards people who are  not worthy to even lick  the dirt off of Morris' boots. &quot;The Thin Blueline&quot; was my first  introduction to his oeuvre.  I consider this particular  documentary  dealing with the sloppy work of the police in Texas that almost doomed an  innocent man as the greatest of its kind ever made.Fred Leuchter is  someone who possesses few credentials behind his name.  He gravitated to a  niche that was being ignored by professional  engineers.  After all, how  many graduates of our centers of higher learning have the slightest  interest in developing equipment to kill  convicted criminals?  The pay  isn't all that good, and it's kind of awkward at social gatherings to  explain how one earns a living!  Leuchter  had a virtual monopoly simply  because the competition was sparse. Leuchter apparently did superb work,  and regardless of one's opinion  about the death penalty,  I am sure those  on death row are relieved that the end of their life will be carried out as  painlessly and quickly as  possible.  Leuchter comes across as a man with  few social skills, and little desire to develop close human relationships.  Short, physically  unattractive, and myopically obsessed with his morbid  inventions, Leuchter is someone who rarely stands out in a crowd.  This  probably  best explains why Leuchter was so receptive to the offer to do  &quot;scientific research&quot; for the holocaust deniers.  Leuchter isn't  motivated by  anti-Semitism, and is also not someone inclined to join hate  groups to give his mundane life existential meaning.  I take him at his  word that  he harbors no ill will towards Jews. Nonetheless, Leuchter was  way over his head, and ultimately made a complete fool of himself.  Fred  Leuchter lacks even the rudimentary scientific  expertise to speak out on  the subject of the Nazi concentration camps.  I refuse, though. to  criticize Leuchter because of his per se lack of formal education.  That  would be a low blow, and viciously unfair.  I do, however, feel totally  justified in stating that Leuchter's informal education in these matters  also leaves much to be desired.  Those like Leuchter, primarily relying  on  self education, often fail to comprehend the limits of their knowledge.  I  also grudgingly respect Leuchter for the courage he displays  after his  life is destroyed for his bizarre involvement with those refusing to accept  the well established proof of the Nazi holocaust.  Leuchter  is admittedly  a pitiful character, but an objective and honest person must also concede  that the man displays a certain grace under pressure.&quot;Mr.  Death&quot; is not escapist entertainment.  It will almost certainly make  the viewer uncomfortable.

The story takes a sudden turn when the focus of the documentary shifts to Leuchter's discoveries at German concentration camps.  His conclusions are stunning; he claims the rooms used for gassing and killing concentration camp workers were not gas chambers at all!!This is where the film becomes really awesome and hair-raising.  Here it discusses the trial that followed after the results and people reacting to Leuchter's odd behavior.  Errol Morris does his best to give an objective viewpoint on the whole affair.  He does not try to make Leuchter look like a devil or angel.  It is surprising that a seemingly innocent and simple man like Leuchter could be caught up in such a gigantic controversy.

But the masterstroke of the film is in its message of how overconfidence in one's abilities can lead to self-ruin, a timeless message which has been repeated throughout literature for centuries. But Morris' take on this moral lesson is unique, unusually thought-provoking and at times downright disturbing.The film does begin on a somewhat &quot;lighter&quot; note, however. For the first thirty minutes, we are invited into the mind of Leuchter who explains in great detail the formation and zenith of his career as an &quot;execution specialist.&quot; His father worked as a prison superintendent in a Massachusetts correction facility and as a result of what he told his son concerning the prevailing conditions of the execution equipment used there, Leuchter was inspired to do something about it. He decided that it would be his mission in life to make sure that execution equipment would be designed so that the prisoner being executed would be put to death as quickly as possible and with no physical harm being done to those who were required to witness the execution.It was a noble profession to pursue, despite the morbidness of it, and therefore quickly built a fine reputation throughout the country, with prison officials contacting him on a regular basis with requests for new electric chairs built to his standard. Strangely, some of these officials felt he also had the ability to construct lethal injection machines as well, despite his lack of knowledge. Morris uses subtle points like this to lead us into the second part of the film: &quot;The Trial of Ernst Zundel.&quot;From this moment on the film enters the realm of the surreal. &quot;Surreal&quot; is a term which is way overused these days by many writers, but I feel it is entirely appropiate here due to the bizzare contradictions that are raised. Zundel's historical revisionist paper entitled &quot;Did Six Million Really Die?&quot; landed him in trouble with the Canadian government. He contacted Leuchter based on his reputation as an execution specialist and Leuchter agreed to testify in defense of what he wrote. Why? Leuchter states that it was Zundel's right to write and publish whatever he wished, that is, if you believe in free speech. That's a fair argument, but knowing Zundel's affiliation leads to some unsettling conclusions about Leuchter. To make matters worse, Leuchter undertakes his own investigation of three of the death camps in Poland. Ignoring the immense archival evidence available at the local libraries, Leuchter concludes, based on his own meticulous measurements and concrete samples of the infrastructure that there was no way that the Holocaust could have happened, because he felt that the structures simply weren't designed to kill people. If so, then what were they? Leuchter offers no explanation for this. Instead, he publishes his findings and is almost immediately taken in by Neo-Nazi organizations on a whirlwind tour throughout America and Europe.Morris seems to ask us one question in particular over and over again throughout the film: Which is more important, free speech, even if it is mired in ignorance and denial, or a &quot;responsibility to the truth&quot;, which is what Leuchter ironically states in one of his speeches. His answer seems to be: You decide.",5,&quot;Holocaust denial is a story about vanity...,980035200,"01 21, 2001",2001,3554,"['be', 'spotlight.', 'quot', 'desire', 'be', 'famous', 'even', 'expense', 'one', 'career', 'focus', 'Morris', 'fascinating', 'portrayal', 'Fred', 'Leuchter', 'who', 'once', 'had', 'reputation', 'being', 'one', 'United', 'States', 'leading', 'designers', 'execution', 'equipment', 'masterstroke', 'film', 'message', 'how', 'overconfidence', 'one', 'abilities', 'can', 'lead', 'self-ruin', 'timeless', 'message', 'been', 'repeated', 'literature', 'centuries', 'Morris', 'take', 'moral', 'lesson', 'unique', 'unusually', 'thought-provoking', 'times', 'downright', 'disturbing.The', 'film', 'begin', 'somewhat', 'quot', 'lighter', 'quot', 'note', 'however', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'are', 'invited', 'mind', 'Leuchter', 'who', 'great', 'detail', 'formation', 'zenith', 'career', 'quot', 'execution', 'specialist.', 'quot', 'father', 'worked', 'prison', 'superintendent', 'Massachusetts', 'correction', 'facility', 'result', 'what', 'told', 'son', 'concerning', 'prevailing', 'conditions', 'execution', 'equipment', 'used', 'there', 'Leuchter', 'was', 'inspired', 'do', 'something', 'decided', 'would', 'be', 'mission', 'life', 'make', 'sure', 'execution', 'equipment', 'would', 'be', 'designed', 'so', 'prisoner', 'being', 'executed', 'would', 'be', 'put', 'death', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'physical', 'harm', 'being', 'done', 'who', 'were', 'required', 'witness', 'execution.It', 'was', 'noble', 'profession', 'pursue', 'morbidness', 'therefore', 'quickly', 'built', 'fine', 'reputation', 'country', 'prison', 'officials', 'contacting', 'regular', 'basis', 'requests', 'new', 'electric', 'chairs', 'built', 'standard', 'Strangely', 'officials', 'felt', 'also', 'had', 'ability', 'construct', 'lethal', 'injection', 'machines', 'as', 'well', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'Morris', 'subtle', 'points', 'lead', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'quot', 'Trial', 'Ernst', 'Zundel.', 'quot', 'moment', 'film', 'realm', 'surreal', 'quot', 'Surreal', 'quot', 'term', 'way', 'overused', 'days', 'many', 'writers', 'feel', 'entirely', 'appropiate', 'here', 'due', 'bizzare', 'contradictions', 'are', 'raised', 'Zundel', 'historical', 'revisionist', 'paper', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Did', 'Six', 'Million', 'Really', 'Die', 'quot', 'landed', 'trouble', 'Canadian', 'government', 'contacted', 'Leuchter', 'based', 'reputation', 'execution', 'specialist', 'Leuchter', 'agreed', 'testify', 'defense', 'what', 'wrote', 'Why', 'Leuchter', 'was', 'Zundel', 'right', 'write', 'publish', 'wished', 'believe', 'free', 'speech', 'fair', 'argument', 'knowing', 'Zundel', 'affiliation', 'unsettling', 'conclusions', 'Leuchter', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Leuchter', 'own', 'investigation', 'three', 'death', 'camps', 'Poland', 'Ignoring', 'immense', 'archival', 'evidence', 'available', 'local', 'libraries', 'Leuchter', 'based', 'own', 'meticulous', 'measurements', 'concrete', 'samples', 'infrastructure', 'was', 'way', 'Holocaust', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'felt', 'structures', 'simply', 'were', ""n't"", 'designed', 'kill', 'people', 'so', 'then', 'what', 'were', 'Leuchter', 'explanation', 'Instead', 'findings', 'almost', 'immediately', 'taken', 'Neo-Nazi', 'organizations', 'whirlwind', 'tour', 'America', 'Europe.Morris', 'ask', 'one', 'question', 'particular', 'over', 'again', 'film', 'more', 'important', 'free', 'speech', 'even', 'mired', 'ignorance', 'denial', 'quot', 'responsibility', 'truth', 'quot', 'what', 'Leuchter', 'ironically', 'one', 'speeches', 'answer', 'be', 'decide']",N/A

His findings can be found inThe Leuchter Reports. Critical Edition. Mr. Death deals with that examination and its aftermath.In late 1998 a preliminary screening of the film was held at Harvard.  Much to the consternation of the filmmakers, many of the students became convinced that Leuchter was correct, while others accused Morris of ""defending a Nazi.""  A screening at the Sundance film festival on January 27, 1999 produced a similar effect.  The film was subsequently revised to be much more unsympathetic to Leuchter.The chief criticisms of Leuchter in the film come from Robert Jan van Pelt and James Roth.  Van Pelt holds a theological view of Auschwitz, stating that ""Auschwitz is like the holy of holies. I prepared years to go there and to have a fool [Leuchter] come in, come in completely unprepared, it's sacrilege. Somebody who walks into the holy of holies and doesn't give a damn.""  Unsurprisingly, such a theological view does not promote factual accuracy, as shown in Carlo Mattogno's reply to van Pelt:Auschwitz - The Case for Sanity: A Historical and Technical Study of Jean-Claude Pressac's ""Criminal Traces"" and Robert Jan Van Pelt's ""Convergence of Evidence"" (Holocaust Handbook).Leuchter's work was the beginning of forensics at Auschwitz, not the final word.  The exhaustive study of the German chemist Germar Rudolf,The Rudolf Report: Expert Report on Chemical and Technical Aspectsset to rest a number of questions left open in Leuchter's examination.

68486,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0783240260,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[5, 9]","This film is fascinating because it shows how science and engineering can be misled when the scientist or the engineer gets down into the real field of his research or work. Criteria that are clear and clear-cut in books, become fuzzy in reality. Fuzzy ans entertwined. Mr Leuchter made a mistake in Auschwitz because he neglected one element : cyanide deposits can only penetrate concrete and bricks as deep as a few microns. He picked big samples and the result of the analysis deluted the deposit. But it is not enough to prove him wrong when he says that he did not find any cyanide deposits in those samples, hence that those rooms he visited were not used as gaschambers. We must also take into account the deluting of these deposits over time and in connection with the exposition to natural elements. We should also take into account the difference in penetration according to the material (concrete versus bricks, etc). But this film shows how practicality is dangerous in the field of science. It is not enough to be practical, that is to believe what we can see and touch, to be true, to reach truth. Thruth is beyond practicality. But at the same time, there is no absolute and foreverlasting truth. Truth changes with time and new discoveries, new approaches can change what we believe. Though we do not see how we can negate the Holocaust, the millions of victims, historians must go on working on the evaluation of the event to understand the meaning of it, and also to refine the knowledge of the facts. Mr Leuchter got trapped in practical knowledge and lost track of the truth. But he is more naive than criminal. We must also consider that if he came to his conclusion, some others are going to come to the same conclusion. So we should work hard on disentangling facts, exploring evidence in order to make sure the fundamental core of the truth about such events will not be forgotten or neglected and the fundamental core is that so many millions of people died there, actually were killed. The number of people actually gassed and those dying of exhaustion or being fired or beaten to death is not the core of the truth. It is that six million people actually died there, even if they did not all die in gaschambers, just as they were not all cremated. The horror of this event is so powerful that we at times forget to discuss the data and to go on collecting data. This film also shows somewhere that when you support the death penalty, you may become so friendly with the death of others that you may minimise death in general. Death has to be a natural event and not an artificial or man-made event because in the second case some people may cultivate the desire, that will seem natural to them, to inflict death onto other people. Finally I find unacceptable that a man may be victimized by the whole society or by some people who have some power in this society because he says something that may be wrong, or even that is wrong for us who do not even make the effort to discuss with him and convince him of his mistake.

68487,A332MW6OA1LYDF,0783240260,John Noodles,"[7, 10]","What a peculiar and compelling documentary!  Throughout the first part of this movie, Leuchter talks about his improvements upon various execution devices, and not with a little pride.  He *says* he designs these things because the older devices are inhumane, that the electric chairs, for example, &quot;cook&quot; people, torture them, and that he wants to make executions as painless and quick as possible...and, you know, I believe him.  He comes off as weird, but sincere.His underground notoriety as an execution expert motivates holocaust revisionist &quot;historian&quot; Ernst Z&uuml;ndel to hire him to prove to a judge and jury that Nazis did not, in fact, exterminate Jews.  So Leuchter goes to Auschwitz and--illegally--gathers samples from the &quot;alleged&quot; gas chambers, crematoriums, and so on.  He smuggles these samples back to Canada, and a lab determines that they contain no traces of cyanide gas.  Based on this--and this alone, apparently--Leuchter (an engineer, but by no means a research scientist) concludes that the gas chambers were never used to gas inmates, and that the holocaust did not happen.Leuchter's evidence is easily refuted.  It isn't the filmmaker's purpose to prove him wrong, and the refutation is quickly and easily accomplished without belaboring it.  What is perhaps most interesting about this film is the manner in which it portrays Leuchter:  He comes off as something of a stooge, a naive and terribly misguided participant in perhaps the most politically incorrect of all historical revisionism.  As a result of this, he is mercilessly persecuted by people who will not tolerate the existence--let alone promulgation--of opposing points of view.  Disagreement is decried as &quot;hate,&quot; and in our current social environment, once you have successfully identified someone as a hatemonger, it's open season on him, In this sense, the film becomes a critical examination of a freedom we Americans claim to hold dear:  the freedom of expression.  It is a freedom that comes with a price, and that is that unpopular, often wacky, ideas will be promulgated by people we may not like.  The fact is, though, that Leuchter is not an anti-semite.  Morris does not show a man with an ounce of hatred in him, or malice, and so far as we can tell, there is no ideology behind Leuchter's belief that the holocaust did not occur. That Morris manages to show Leuchter in a reasonably sympathetic light forces us to examine the alactrity with which we so often attack and attempt to destroy the speaker of unpopular ideas, when perhaps all we really ought to do is attack the ideas that are being spoken.  What makes us uncomfortable as viewers, I think, is that we feel sympathy for this guy.  Clearly, he is the victim, more than the persecutor.",5,A Weird &amp; Subtle Commentary on Freedom of Speech,970358400,"10 1, 2000",2000,2793,"['What', 'peculiar', 'compelling', 'documentary', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'Leuchter', 'talks', 'improvements', 'various', 'execution', 'devices', 'not', 'little', 'pride', 'things', 'older', 'devices', 'are', 'inhumane', 'electric', 'chairs', 'example', 'quot', 'cook', 'quot', 'people', 'torture', 'make', 'executions', 'painless', 'quick', 'possible', 'know', 'believe', 'off', 'weird', 'sincere.His', 'underground', 'notoriety', 'execution', 'expert', 'holocaust', 'revisionist', 'quot', 'historian', 'quot', 'Ernst', 'Z', 'uuml', 'hire', 'prove', 'judge', 'jury', 'Nazis', 'did', 'not', 'fact', 'exterminate', 'Jews', 'So', 'Leuchter', 'Auschwitz', 'illegally', 'gathers', 'samples', 'quot', 'alleged', 'quot', 'gas', 'chambers', 'crematoriums', 'so', 'samples', 'back', 'Canada', 'lab', 'contain', 'traces', 'cyanide', 'gas', 'Based', 'alone', 'apparently', 'Leuchter', 'engineer', 'research', 'scientist', 'gas', 'chambers', 'were', 'never', 'used', 'gas', 'inmates', 'holocaust', 'did', 'not', 'happen.Leuchter', 'evidence', 'easily', 'refuted', ""n't"", 'filmmaker', 'purpose', 'prove', 'wrong', 'refutation', 'quickly', 'easily', 'accomplished', 'belaboring', 'What', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'film', 'manner', 'Leuchter', 'off', 'something', 'stooge', 'naive', 'terribly', 'misguided', 'participant', 'perhaps', 'most', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'historical', 'revisionism', 'result', 'mercilessly', 'persecuted', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'tolerate', 'existence', 'let', 'alone', 'promulgation', 'opposing', 'points', 'view', 'Disagreement', 'decried', 'quot', 'hate', 'quot', 'current', 'social', 'environment', 'once', 'have', 'successfully', 'identified', 'someone', 'hatemonger', 'open', 'season', 'sense', 'film', 'critical', 'examination', 'freedom', 'Americans', 'claim', 'hold', 'dear', 'freedom', 'expression', 'freedom', 'price', 'unpopular', 'often', 'wacky', 'ideas', 'will', 'be', 'promulgated', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'fact', 'though', 'Leuchter', 'not', 'anti-semite', 'Morris', 'not', 'show', 'man', 'ounce', 'hatred', 'malice', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'ideology', 'Leuchter', 'belief', 'holocaust', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'Morris', 'show', 'Leuchter', 'reasonably', 'sympathetic', 'light', 'forces', 'examine', 'alactrity', 'so', 'often', 'attack', 'attempt', 'destroy', 'speaker', 'unpopular', 'ideas', 'when', 'perhaps', 'really', 'ought', 'do', 'attack', 'ideas', 'are', 'being', 'spoken', 'What', 'uncomfortable', 'viewers', 'think', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'guy', 'Clearly', 'victim', 'more', 'persecutor']",N/A
68488,A2Q0ERQ25AQQNG,0783240260,Jonas Cukierman,"[0, 3]","Known for his unique taste in offbeat and outrageous subject matter,  director Errol Morris (The Thin Blue Line, A Brief History Of Time) takes  us into the realm of the executioner in his new documentary, Mr.  Death.Throughout the course of one day, Fred Leuchter, Jr. (Mr. Death)  drinks forty cups of coffee, smokes six packs of cigarettes, and is still  able to sleep soundly. An eerie man by every stretch of the imagination,  Leuchter is the designer of latest generation electric chairs, lethal  injections and other methods of  ""humane"" execution. As the film takes you  increasingly into the mind of this eccentric individual, one cannot help  but notice that he has a sick but perhaps human interest in creating his  contraptions. Throughout the picture, we experience a roller coaster of  humor, idiosyncrasy and disturbing imagery. Much of the screen time is  spent showing the diminutive Leuchter being interviewed and describing how  he became who he is today, as well as detailing the gruesome events that  occur at a state execution, be it by chair or needle.Since our  caffeine-addicted celebrity is a self-proclaimed expert in the field of  engineering and other great feats, he is employed by a group of pro-Nazi  sympathizers whom deny the Holocaust ever occurred.  The once inconspicuous  nerd who greatly resembles a groundhog is asked by the leader of the hate  group (historical revisionists) to visit Auschwitz and chisel samples of  the stone structures that once housed the gas chambers.  Little by little,  Morris takes the audience on a mental adventure of fear and disbelief as he  slowly chips away at the man we might have thought was a mere curiosity,  but now realize that along with his peculiar profession and his drinking  problem, is an unbalanced media whore who will jump at any chance of  fame.The film takes the audience on a grim trip down history lane in  more ways than meet the eye. One can make a good assessment in saying that  Fred Leuchter draws a parallel to Adolf Hitler and the band of thugs whom  were his followers. A failed artist, Hitler saw a window of opportunity to  take advantage of a Germany in a time when her economy was depressed and  morale was low. Where previously they were teetering on the brink of  starvation, some Germans now took a desperate refuge in Hitler's new and  deceptive climate of belonging. Like the rise of the Nazis, Leuchter sees a  chance to go from a complete unknown to savoring the fame of a false  credibility. As many figures before him, Leuchter rises to fame as one who  ascribes to fanatic notions, and like the Nazis, Mr. Death is an innovator  of the machineries of mortality. In contrast, while Hitler was a failure to  begin with, Leuchter was successful at his profession before jumping on the  bandwagon of Holocaust disclaimers. It is only after his public recognition  that he is labeled an unsavory character, because like his neo-Nazi  counterparts, he puts faith in a concept that is fleeting and  self-destructive.The film's full title is Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall  of Fred Luechter, Jr. In a different and more permissive era, there is a  good chance that Fred Leuchter would made been a man not unlike Dr.  Mengele.The most compelling moral of this story is how easily a person  can convince himself that he is an expert on a subject, even though many  sound observers realize he is merely putting on a fa?ade. Lastly, it is an  unsettling jolt to see how effortlessly certain people can be duped into  believing anything if it means perpetuating their name.This film is by  no means part of the endless debate over capital punishment. Rather, it is  a testament to the megalomania that plagues every society in every  generation.",5,Looking at Death In The Face,959040000,"05 23, 2000",2000,3745,"['Known', 'unique', 'taste', 'offbeat', 'outrageous', 'subject', 'matter', 'director', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'Thin', 'Blue', 'Line', 'A', 'Brief', 'History', 'Time', 'realm', 'executioner', 'new', 'documentary', 'Mr.', 'Death.Throughout', 'course', 'one', 'day', 'Fred', 'Leuchter', 'Jr.', 'Mr.', 'Death', 'forty', 'cups', 'coffee', 'smokes', 'six', 'packs', 'cigarettes', 'still', 'able', 'sleep', 'soundly', 'eerie', 'man', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'Leuchter', 'designer', 'latest', 'generation', 'electric', 'chairs', 'lethal', 'injections', 'other', 'methods', 'humane', 'execution', 'film', 'increasingly', 'mind', 'eccentric', 'individual', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'notice', 'sick', 'perhaps', 'human', 'interest', 'creating', 'contraptions', 'picture', 'experience', 'roller', 'coaster', 'humor', 'idiosyncrasy', 'disturbing', 'imagery', 'Much', 'screen', 'time', 'spent', 'showing', 'diminutive', 'Leuchter', 'being', 'interviewed', 'describing', 'how', 'became', 'who', 'today', 'as', 'well', 'detailing', 'gruesome', 'events', 'occur', 'state', 'execution', 'be', 'chair', 'needle.Since', 'caffeine-addicted', 'celebrity', 'self-proclaimed', 'expert', 'field', 'engineering', 'other', 'great', 'feats', 'employed', 'group', 'pro-Nazi', 'sympathizers', 'whom', 'deny', 'Holocaust', 'ever', 'occurred', 'once', 'inconspicuous', 'nerd', 'who', 'greatly', 'groundhog', 'asked', 'leader', 'hate', 'group', 'historical', 'revisionists', 'visit', 'Auschwitz', 'chisel', 'samples', 'stone', 'once', 'housed', 'gas', 'chambers', 'Little', 'little', 'Morris', 'audience', 'mental', 'adventure', 'fear', 'disbelief', 'slowly', 'chips', 'away', 'man', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'was', 'mere', 'curiosity', 'now', 'realize', 'peculiar', 'profession', 'drinking', 'problem', 'unbalanced', 'media', 'whore', 'who', 'will', 'jump', 'chance', 'fame.The', 'film', 'audience', 'grim', 'trip', 'down', 'history', 'lane', 'more', 'ways', 'meet', 'eye', 'One', 'can', 'make', 'good', 'assessment', 'saying', 'Fred', 'Leuchter', 'parallel', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'band', 'thugs', 'whom', 'were', 'followers', 'failed', 'artist', 'Hitler', 'saw', 'window', 'opportunity', 'take', 'advantage', 'Germany', 'time', 'when', 'economy', 'was', 'depressed', 'morale', 'was', 'low', 'Where', 'previously', 'were', 'teetering', 'brink', 'starvation', 'Germans', 'now', 'took', 'desperate', 'refuge', 'Hitler', 'new', 'deceptive', 'climate', 'belonging', 'rise', 'Nazis', 'Leuchter', 'chance', 'go', 'complete', 'unknown', 'savoring', 'fame', 'false', 'credibility', 'many', 'figures', 'Leuchter', 'fame', 'one', 'who', 'fanatic', 'notions', 'Nazis', 'Mr.', 'Death', 'innovator', 'machineries', 'mortality', 'contrast', 'Hitler', 'was', 'failure', 'begin', 'Leuchter', 'was', 'successful', 'profession', 'jumping', 'bandwagon', 'Holocaust', 'disclaimers', 'only', 'public', 'recognition', 'labeled', 'unsavory', 'character', 'neo-Nazi', 'counterparts', 'faith', 'concept', 'fleeting', 'self-destructive.The', 'film', 'full', 'title', 'Mr.', 'Death', 'Rise', 'Fall', 'Fred', 'Luechter', 'Jr', 'different', 'more', 'permissive', 'era', 'good', 'chance', 'Fred', 'Leuchter', 'would', 'made', 'been', 'man', 'not', 'Dr.', 'Mengele.The', 'most', 'compelling', 'moral', 'story', 'how', 'easily', 'person', 'can', 'convince', 'expert', 'subject', 'even', 'many', 'sound', 'observers', 'realize', 'merely', 'putting', 'fa', 'ade', 'Lastly', 'unsettling', 'jolt', 'see', 'how', 'effortlessly', 'certain', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'duped', 'believing', 'anything', 'perpetuating', 'name.This', 'film', 'means', 'part', 'endless', 'debate', 'capital', 'punishment', 'Rather', 'testament', 'megalomania', 'society', 'generation']",N/A

The masses, that is, generally prefer a fictional cliffhanger/thriller with cleverly prefigured twists and turns.That said, this is one documentary that would most certainly please those very masses. It plays like the highest rate cliffhanger and while the twists and turns are real, they are as clever as any fictive ones I've seen.""Mr Death"" is the story of Fred Leuchter, a self-taught but obviously intelligent ""engineer"" of execution equipment that is more humane than that currently in practice. The first part of the film is largely a biography of his rise from working on an electric chair in Tenessee, to redesigning a lethal injection room, a gallows, and even a gas chamber in other states.If the first half is about his rise, the second half - the title suggests it - pertains to his fall. This happens when Ernst Zundel, a holocaust denier out of Canada, hires Luechter after being brought up on arcane charges by the Canadian government, where it is illegal to deny the holocaust on paper(?). Luechter's job is to go to Auschwitz to determine whether Zundel's claim that there were no gas chambers there is in any way rational. The film chronicles Luecther's travels and ultimate judgement that Zundel is correct.From there - and Zundel eventually loses the case - Luechter's buzzing career enters a tail spin. No one in the states, that is, wants to work with a holocaust denier, much less on execution equipment. He is blackballed.Most of the film consists of interviews with Luechter interspersed with scentery pertaining to the events being discussed. (Also interviewed are Ernst Zundel, another holocaust denier David Irving, Luechter's anonymous ex-wife, an historian who followed Luechter's Auschwitz travels with an eye towards discrediting them, and a few others.)Like other Errol Morris films, Mr. Death will have you thinking about its subject matter long after the stop button has been pressed. It entertains questions such as how we are to feel towards Luechter. Is he an anti-semite who had mallicious intent? Is he an intelligent man who just did faulty research? Is he a man not nearly as smart as he thinks who simply wanted noteriety? Or is he - just entertain the thought - a man who has uncovered a politically unpopular truth? Who is this man Fred Luechter, and what were his motivations?These questions are left up to the viewer. While I get the feeling that Morris wants us to feel sorry for Luechter as a man who got sloppy due to the excitement of the trial, the film never says one way or the other.

Rasband,"[2, 4]","Morris' spellbinding, terrifying film is the portrait of a man who is morally tone-deaf, who is unable to recognize essential differences between good and evil outside of his own little life. The video footage of Leuchter at Birkenau with his chisel, obliviously desecrating the site, almost made me sick to my stomach, as if someone were to take a hammer to the headstone of someone else's parent without permission. That he considered his trip to Auschwitz his honeymoon is a detail that could have come from one of Evelyn Waugh's darkest comic novels. You have to feel sympathy for how his life has been laid to waste by his foolish actions, but you have to ask yourself: what ... was he thinking? In his interviews with Morris, with his constant inappropriate little jokes and remarks about things that are beyond his ken, you realize you are looking at an exemplar of the ultimate moral idiocy of technology without a heart or mature perspective. Leuchter can build anything; he even implies he could make the gas chambers operational again (that is, if they ever existed in the first place).

I jotted down the title, and several years later watched the video.I wasn't expecting to be quite as disturbed as I was by the first half of the video -- the discussions of the mechanics of electrocution, the physical reactions that occur, and the merits of one type of execution versus another were more troubling than I would've expected. Also disturbing was the short, grainy film of an elephant being electrocuted in 1903.The second half of the film, which deals with Leuchter's involvement in a Holocaust trial, is fascinating. Leuchter treats his part of the trial as if it's a fun game, and seems to have no idea what he's getting involved with. I began feeling sorry for him -- it was obvious that he was getting into a situation for which he was completely unprepared. I stopped feeling sorry for him when his ego kicked in.

After all, there aren't many people who earn money designing ways to execute prisoners while pursuing holocaust denial on the side. Documentary filmmaker Errol Morris - who has a definite taste for the offbeat - profiles Leuchter in the thought-provoking documentary Mr. Death.Viewers will be ambivalent about Leuchter. Certainly, he has interesting stories to tell - such as the time he had an electric chair sitting in his front yard. Leuchter also provides gory, cringe-inducing descriptions of what happens to prisoners during executions.While the first part of Mr. Death focuses on Leuchter's involvement with executions, the second part focuses on his involvement in Holocaust denial. Here, Leuchter bizarre character becomes clear. Mr. Death includes extensive videos - shot by Leuchter's friends - of his ""honeymoon"" at Auschwitz. (Leuchter had just married a waitress who used to serve him coffee before they made the trip and he jokingly told her that it was their honeymoon). In the videos, Leuchter gleefully hacks out pieces of the walls of the Auschwitz camp so that he can bring them back for the U.S. to test to see whether they contain cyanide. He seems unaware that this might be wrong. (Unfortunately, the film frustrates the viewer by not exploring Leuchter's motivations for becoming involved in Holocaust denial).In the end, Leuchter is a sad, defeated person.

The opening shot is a beautifully photographed montage of Fred Leuchter (or an actor?) being raised up in a metal cage in a lightning chamber. The photography is amazing and the metaphor is interesting (Leuchter worked on electric chair technology), but it made me wonder how exactly the imagery told the story.There are other similar scenes. When Fred talks about his coffee and nicotine addiction, there is are lingering slow-motion shots of coffee being poured, coffee being consumed, reflections in a coffee mug. The effects are pretty, but pointless; a single, slightly interesting fact about Fred is stretched into a too-long display of flashy cinematography. The same goes for slow-mo shots of brick and concrete samples being crushed, walls being chipped, and the like.Several scenes are apparently re-enactments by actors, but it's never made clear until you read the closing credits and see that there was a cast for re-enactment. Was the lightning scene real? Were the slow-mo shots of someone in the Auschwitz basement real?  Who knows, and what's the point anyway?The story is interesting, but the substantive material would have fit into 30 minutes.
